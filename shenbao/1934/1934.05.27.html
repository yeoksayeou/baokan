<h3 id="c1">遠東問題海軍問題不可分離　日慮英美恊力處置　華盛頓方面重視政治討論　英請書内容充滿妥恊語氣　日擬向英美兩國分頭談判 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日國際觀察者預測、英美將恊力抵制日本對明年海軍軍縮會議初步談判提出之議程、據稱、日本現正竭力與英美兩國分别談話、期於遠東政治問題及海軍問題獲得初步諒解、惟今日可靠方面宣稱、英美外交家僉認政治問題與海軍比率問題、實有不可分離之連帶關係、日本在亞洲大陸之軍事行動益使彼等難於單獨對口談判、英美以爲兩國在遠東之商業地位、及太平洋全部市塲、均於此政治談判中、存亡所繫、今日國務院表示、美國已通知英國、願意加入海軍會議之初步談判、此項初步談判在倫敦舉行、惟日期尙未决定、細則亦未確定、所可知者、此項會議將完全爲非正式性質云、英國亦巳邀請日·意·法參加、此項會議不僅爲兩國代表分頭接談、三四國代表且將同時會議云、次談判首將確定明年會議之手續、决定日期與地點後、再討論海軍實質問題等其他事件、今日華盛頓日人方面宣稱、倫敦方面旣已發起此事、彼等實無再向國務院討論海軍問題之理由云、若干外交家信東京與華盛頓方面不久將派遣海軍專家赴倫敦、俾於預備會議中襄助兩國大使、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）據今日官方人員表示、廣田外相將於星期杪訓令駐英大使松平、向英政府表示、日政府凖備討論一九三五年海軍會議事件、預料倫敦之討論、除會議之日期·地點·及進行手續諸問題外、似尙將涉及海軍限制一類之重要問題、向日政府探詢意見者、雖僅爲英國、而據現象觀之、日方亦願應請在華盛頓作同樣談話、舉行海軍會議以前作初步談話之議、固爲一般人士所歡迎、而本地報紙則切言宜注視英美間之談話、俾免英美先有成議、然後威脅日本接受、如一九三○年之所爲、此種論調、似爲官方觀念之反映、日報雖謂日本僅願獲原則上之均等、而藉以維持主權與國防、但盛倡取銷比率、謂此項比率、有種種不便、被迫建造不急需諸類之軍艦、亦其一也、云云、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於明年舉行會議之討論、各方面皆力守緘默、外交部與海軍部皆不願表示意見、衆信討論程度今尙不過初步探詢耳、一九三○年海軍會議開始以前、曾有初步談話、頗有助於會議之成功、故今亦擬預作談話、其所將討論之事件、殆爲一九三五年會議之日期·與地點·及應請與會之國家、聞法意兩國對於英國所發參加談話之請尙未答覆、但衆料此兩國定願參加、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">日本恊議對英請書覆文　外務省海軍省　開始愼重討論 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（東京）今日探悉、日政府接英外相西門之請、對於海軍問題預先交換意見、以謀海軍會議之便利、聞日政府擬與英美兩國分别談話、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）英西門外相提議召開軍縮預備會議、日本政府對此表示同意、然西門外相之提議、對於開會日期及議題等桫有表示、故將於此點明白後、由外務海軍兩當局恊議、發出正式回答、但日本因廣由外相曾於議會有聲明、擬與各國分别進行預備會談、商議具體事項、（二十六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據外務省二十五日接到駐英松平大使電報、英西門外相於十七日會見松平大使、主張舉行召開海軍軍縮預備會議、以期達成世界和平、銷弭戰爭威脅及輕减國民負擔之三大根本目的、西門外相又略述英國海軍之軍制及英國對於海軍一般問題之見解、而請求日政府之回知、松平大使因此問題非常重大、未發負責談話、保留回答、（二十六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省對於西門所提之三國預備會議案、已於二十六日以駐日英使所談爲中心、由廣田外相邀集重光外次等人開始愼重討論、並擬參酌海軍當局之意向、以便决定態度、將由廣田外相報告於閣議後、卽向英國發出正式回答、聞此項會議並非聚日英美三國於一堂之會談、當由日美日英英美各國分别交涉、形式上大致如此、但視其狀况若何、或三國會商於一室、亦未可知、此項會議多半在七月至九月間當可實現云（二十六日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）在明年軍縮會議之前、日本海軍業已及早凖備、近以英外相西門對駐英日大使通知舉行預備會議、是以海軍亦擬於最近當由外務省轉其回答預備參加之意、一面關於軍縮正式會議之召集、亦經着手凖備一切矣云（廿六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）駐日英國代理大使多德氏於廿六日午後一時頃訪晤重光外次、提議召開海軍預備會議案、其内容與西門外相向駐英日使提出者相同、並探詢日本政府之方針、重光外次略謂、此事甚好、但事勢至爲重大、當舉關係方面充分商妥之後、方能給予答覆云、（廿六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）海軍軍縮會議之預備倘經召集、則英國當以西門外相爲代表、美國必以其駐英大使賓甘氏及派駐日内瓦一般軍縮會議之全權代表台維斯氏充任、日本則以駐英大使松平氏爲首度代表、而以大使館參事官加藤外松氏爲其首席事務官、倘該項預備會議進展甚速、則日本駐英大使館之辦事人員當感不足、屆時可由外務省增派駐外書官以圖充實其陣容、廣田外相現已着手於該項人選、至於陸海軍方面更應以專門人才爲其顧問、使之參加、自不待言、大致將以駐在倫敦之海軍武官岡噺　大佐與陸軍中佐丸山政男氏充之、此外如駐日内瓦一般軍縮會議之日本代表陸軍少將森田宣氏及海軍大佐藤田利三郎氏均須遣往倫敦、日本方面之陣容在此業已整備就緒、近當由廣田外相發出訓令云、（二十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）次期軍縮會議、因倫敦條約第二十三條有規定、必定舉行、然開會地點形式及議題等並無規定、故必先由各國進行恊議、然究竟何國願任主辦國、列國均取愼重態度、探查他國意見、在此時際、英國俄然提議召開會議、蓋英國爲倫敦會議之召開國、其對於軍縮問題熱心實可敬服、於是一九三五年海軍會議之具體交涉、開始第一步驟、今後最堪注目者爲日英美三國之交涉如何也、（二十六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據倫敦方面消息、傳一九三五年海軍會議之預備交涉、將在東京倫敦兩地分别舉行、日本於此交涉、已讓步海軍率之平等要求、日本海軍對此、頃發表聲明、謂日本海軍仍然要求確立軍備權之平等、日本態度在使世界各國達成軍縮對於各自國防有均等之安全感、此志迄無何等變更之事實云、（二十六日電通社電）</p>
<h3 id="c3">英國請書内容　討論海軍實質問題　以英美日爲出發點 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（東京）關於下屆海軍會議之凖備工作、將與重要海軍國間召集預備會議之提案、曾於十七日英外相與駐英日使會見之際、已由西門外相正式通知、事屬確實、外務省曾將西門提議之内容嚴守秘密、現得悉其要點如左、</p>
<p>㈠預備會議希望討論海軍實質上各種問題、</p>
<p>㈡預備會議專以海軍問題爲限、</p>
<p>㈢預備會議當由倫敦之外交機關發起、而與各國個别交涉、以便行使、</p>
<p>㈣預備會議至少以三國爲起點、而最初當以日英美三國開議、法意兩國目下尙無加入必要、</p>
<p>據上項内容觀之、則預備交涉並非討論下屆海軍會議之開會時期及會議之地點等之議題、乃係直接討論海軍軍縮問題之實質、蓋此項預備會議已增加其重大性矣、在英國方面則限制專就海軍問題之計論、外間有謂所傳之太平洋問題與遠東問題似無包含在内之意思、至於是否會合三國於一堂、而開始討論、雖屬疑問、但關於此點、日本政府亦曾希望與各國行使個别交涉、並以日英美三國之預備交涉爲重心、對於使人注目之該項提議、外務省當與海軍省愼重討論之後、方可給與答覆、唯上述各點旣屬提議之内容、又非違背日本政府之方針、是當欣然參加、故海軍會議可不待來年、而於事實上將在最近開幕云、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）衆議員布立敦今日告美聯社訪員、如允日本提高海軍比率則間島、夏威夷及斐律濱將爲蠻横之日本軍閥所宰割無疑、布立敦議員爲衆院海軍委員會重要人物、久以熟番國際海軍問題見稱於時、其言曰、如日本堅持廢棄現有之海軍比率、則美國應卽於太平洋羣島修築防衛性之海軍空軍根據地、海軍條約將於明年重付討論之時、日本實無理由企圖擴大比率、日本侵占滿洲土地數千萬方里、亦不足使其有此必要、中國海軍更顯然不足爲患也、故惟一結論卽日本謀以獨覇世界之海軍、控制太平洋耳、若然、則太平洋其他國家、必須嚴防日本、不使其得再乘侵佔滿洲之故伎也、如日本堅持其現在之海軍政策、則間島甚易成爲日本强暴之軍國主義之俎上肉、是以吾人必須於該島設立佈防、吾人應於菲律濱要害地點擴充空軍根據地、夏威夷之防務亦應加强、俾成爲直布羅陀第二、吾人更宜要求將日本之他島移交美國或其他國家管理云、布立敦對於訂立新海軍條約之可能性稱、日本過去五年中對各國之條約無異廢紙、日本屠殺華人毁滅華人之財產、實爲無端侵略之惡例云、（二十五日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c5">廢除苛雜不宜再緩敬 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>今日方苛捐雜稅之弊害者多矣。其言曰。自世界經濟恐慌潮流侵入後。我國經濟情勢遂愈見困窘。卽比較發達之紗業。且未能與外國輸入品競爭於市塲其他工業更不待言。蓋不僅向海外輸出。到處遭遇阻碍。卽欲在國内市塲勉强圖存。亦爲苛捐雜稅所阻。此廢除苛雜之不可延緩者。一也。</p>
<p>我國以農立國。而近來因穀價低賤。農民出其全部收穫。尙不足以圖温飽。乃相率脫離鄉村。致形成土地荒廢之恐慌。此種險象。雖可以天災及其他政治原因爲部分之解釋。而構成朝野隔閡及農村衰落之要素。當以苛捐雜稅爲第一。此類苛雜。設不根本掃除。匪特農村經濟之復興無望。卽欲暫維小康之局。亦所難能。此廢除苛雜之不可延緩者。二也。</p>
<p>卽以政府收支關係而論。中央政府之主要財源。厥爲關稅與鹽稅二者。初與苛雜無關。而統稅及印花收入。且不免因苛雜繁重而感受間接之影響。至於地方政府。或以爲倚賴苛雜。可以彌補正稅之不足。其實一般所謂苛雜。由稅吏私人中飽者多。由地方政府實收者。反居少數。是則法外徵收。徒招人民之怨恨。而無甚補助於政府。此廢除苛雜之不可延緩者。三也。</p>
<p>苛捐雜稅之弊害如此。深幸本屆財政會議解釋苛雜之性質。已决定六項範圍。並擬自本年七月一日起至十二月底止。分期裁撤然吾人又有不能已於言者。該會同時又决定。廢除苛雜後之抵補辦法。可以另案核議。而各省市之有特殊情形未能遵限廢除凈盡者。亦得專案呈部。吾人鑒於我國歷來會議之通病。在於議决而不能實施。終至形成懸案而後已。上述財政會議之决議案。附有兩種但書。一與抵補方法有關。一與各省市之特殊情形有關。竊恐流弊所及。將不免蹈旣往種種議案之覆轍。蓋廢除苛雜之舉。各省市旣可藉口抵補籌措未充而展緩實行。又可假借地方特殊情况而推諉卸責。結果。或使今年年底之限期。無形延長。須知我國土地廣大。交通阻滯任何地方。任何省市。皆有其特殊情形。如四川·雲南·新疆·西康·靑海等邊遠省分。其特殊之點。更舉不勝舉。而苛捐雜稅之繁重亦爲當世所罕見。政府如不厲行確實整頓之方針。則陽奉陰違者。必不少也。吾民無瞧類矣。</p>
<p>目前各省市財政狀况。洵有羅掘俱窮難乎爲繼之勢。然此種現象。實爲國民經濟瀕於破產之反映。設再不從事於根本培養使人民有喘息餘地及更生機緣。竊恐國民經濟一旦總崩潰。地方收入。亦不免同歸於盡也。孔財云。「人民負担已深縱再欲徵收苛捐。已不堪負荷。國家根本在民。何忍作無饜之增加。」可見民間疾苦。當局知之甚稔。無論地方有何特殊情形。要不能不排除萬難以解民倒懸也。</p>
<p>吾人以爲旣欲廢除苛雜當爲積極廓淸弊源而努力。不當爲消極抵補缺額而顧慮。往者苛雜之所以難廢大半因各地冗兵太多。府之給養無着。軍隊之紀律鬆弛。遂致轉而擾民故根本解决辦法。第一應由中央嚴令各省區不准編練額外軍隊。現役軍人而兼任省主席者。更不得私自擴充隊伍。第二當再妥籌裁兵方案。旣裁者分别遣散。未裁者給與的餉庶幾中樞命令。可以貫澈而苛捐雜稅亦終有廢除之一日。若不此之圖。而徒言抵補。仍恐無裨於實際耳。</p>

<p>關於軍縮問題、巴爾都謂以前歷屆内閣所行之政策依然遵守、卽在安全條件之下從事軍縮、並求軍備之平等也、但德國正式軍隊以外之軍事團體、法國不能置諸不問、且德國重整軍備之行動、一日不停、則法國卽一日不能承認裁軍、本年四月十七日法國致英國之復文、曾聲明法國始終以爲軍縮會議、當以裁軍爲其最後之結果、至於與和平條約相反之重整軍備、則非軍縮會議所當承認、但無論如何、國聯會與軍縮會議、並未閉門、法國政府乃始終擁護和平、始終忠於國聯會者也、</p>
<p>關於明年薩爾區授票問題巴爾都謂、投票人之自由絶對必須尊重、此次在日内瓦討論時、對於任何辦法、凡足使薩爾居民於投票後受報復之危險者、均堅决拒絶之、關於薩爾問題、法國由條約上取得之權利毫未放棄、此深足自喜者、巴爾都謂渠在日内瓦曾對薩爾問題特種委員會主席阿樂亞西聲明、謂對於薩爾居民投票必須採取有效之保障辦法、德國方面空言保證投票之自由、卽使爲正式宣言亦嫌不足、當時阿樂亞西與特種委員會曾擬定一種方式、認爲可以接受、卽「國聯會爲保護薩爾居民所能採取之各種辦法、法德兩國均願加以承認」、乃德國政府對此方式不願接受、殊可婉惜、</p>
<p>巴爾都最後謂、法國人民無一樂於作戰者、法國人竭盡力量以避免戰爭、渠相信戰爭必可避免、法國人對於友邦及同盟國將始終如一、法國與意大利成立友好妥恊非不可能、其與英國之關係並未冷淡云、此時有人對法國之國際關係提出問題、巴爾都答稱、法國並不處於孤立地位、言至此、全塲議員幾於全體鼓掌、卽社會黨亦在贊成之列、衆院旋以外長指日須赴日内瓦、乃决定將關於外交問題之質問案、延至外長回國以後再行討論隨卽散會、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>爲了業務上的需要，我誠懇地請求你們給我些指導。</p>
<p>我現在的職務是等於一個圖書館的管理員，不過名稱上的不同罷了。所以我很想求得一些關於「統計」「分類」「目錄編製」等學識，不知道有没有這一類學術的書？什麽書局出版？請先生詳爲示覆。</p>
<p>又，我在業餘很想研究些印刷上技術，不知國内有專門研究印刷的雜誌，或書本？併請指示，不勝感盼！</p>
<p>丨徐祝三來信丨</p>
<p>關於業務上需要的知識是最實踐物知識。這一方面的要求，我想自然不止徐君一人，而這方面的社會指導又是一向被人忽視了的。本欄以前也很少討論這類問題，但這不是我們不注意到此，實在是關於這類極平常的問題，反而是極不容易答覆的，以前我們對於許多方面的人才均未找好，所以有一次一位漆匠問我們一些化學上的問題，我們找了許多人都不能答覆，因此，常常不能滿足讀者之望。這次徐君提出的圖書館的知識，到是問到我們自己家裏來了。</p>
<p>不過，我們在商榷這類業務上需要的實際問題的知識以前，必先要明瞭他的業務是處在什麽一種部門·業務上的需要究竟是指那一工作上發生的困難？具體的内容和範圍是什麽？假如没有一種界限，我們的解答就無從着手了。</p>
<p>像徐君提出的問題我們就似乎嫌其含混，籠統，抽象，雖然他說到「統計」「分類」「編目」等問題，但是没有指出這類問題中任何一面較狹義的範圍，于此，我們也只能從一般的圖書館學理上，就管見所及，寫些于下··</p>
<p>一，分類在圖書館中是一項最繁重的工作，這是大家所公認的。圖書分類的含義，就是一般所謂把「件質相同的放在一處」之義，可是，這話驟然看去，似乎意義很明顯，没有甚麽困難，實則常常有一本書有列入兩類或三類以上的事實，遇到這種紛歧和模稜兩可的境界時，常常要費很多的時間去苦思的，所以做這項工作有時候眞會得使人耐煩不了，因爲得不到最適當的一個别類：但有時候也會感覺樂從中來，興趣盎然，不過話雖這樣說，處理一件任何事情，總有它的原則和經騐可資凖繩的，我們姑舉三點如下（一）圖書分類旣没有絶對的科學類别，那我們一方可以理論爲依據，他方却以事實爲前提，在這兩者中間溶合貫通之就是了。我們唯一只要使圖書在運用上感覺取放的便利，那末犧牲一點學理上的定律，是可以的。舉一個例說，如自然科學中的電學和應用技術中的電學，前者是關於自然科學中原理上的電學；後者是關於應用技術中技術上的電學，我們依據理論來分類，上面所舉的兩個例子，應該給它兩個類别，但是假使藏書不多，同時爲某個問題的參考和避免散放起見，歸納在一個類别下，與事實也很合理，（二）對每一本書確定它的類别時儘量取這高的含意，舉個例說，如有一本關於「五卅事件」的書，這書給它分在中日和中英外交問題上也可，分在中國近代史上也可但决不像分在中國民族解放革命運動的含義偉大多了，（三）分類的排列先後順序，是有相當意義的，這點也須儘量依據學理上的定律，舉個例說，如有幾種關於社會思想史記載的圖書，必要顧到發生的次序，不能前後的倒置。</p>
<p>上面舉的三項，是屬於分類方法上一般的扼要論據，同時這一方面的學理，在這裏寫來是嫌紙短話長的，不能一一詳舉。至於分類採用那一種方法的問題，我們在大體上是同意杜威底十進法，以其有伸縮性，如果圖書館的規模小，備書不多，只須用大綱，如果規模大，圖書多，可綱目兼用，如果綱目猶嫌不够，可加用小數點。</p>
<p>（二）編目是圖書館繼分類工作後一種更完善的工作，圖書館有完備的目錄，讀者才可藉目錄的引導檢取心中所欲的資料，不過這編目是一個最實際的而且須靠實習始可領會的，况且編目全看這圖書館的需要和簡繁來確定工作的，有些圖書館僅製書名目錄一種有些圖書館還有著者目錄，標題目錄，分類目錄，甚至字典式目錄，但通常圖書館備置書名和著者二種目錄的居多，至編目的方法有許多規則事實上很難列舉，好在下面有專書介紹，這裏不再贅述。</p>
<p>（三）統計的的問題，我們也以爲與編目近乎同樣一種情形，就是徐君提出的在業務上發生出來的材料怎樣去統計，這全要根據實際的需要來决定的，至於統計的原理與方法，後列幾種書籍可供參考。</p>
<p>（四）關於專門研究印刷術的雜誌和書籍，國内實在没有聞見，最近商務印書館的出版週刊從七十五期起有一欄『印刷常識』一鱗半爪，也値得一閱。再今天報載該館出版一本近代印刷術，定價四角，我們特地去購閱，據說還是他們的處女作品，這點點東西或許稍稍塡滿你萬一的印刷知識慾望吧。</p>

<h3 id="c202">競爭槪况 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲甲二百公尺朱洪琪自前日在百公尤决賽中、造成十一秒五之優異紀錄之後、一般人咸料昨日之一百公尺、當必有可觀之成績發現、起步則後朱愛賢一步、百公尺外尙文之朱一邁、頗有奪魁之想、萬竹之朱始動聲色、結果朱洪琪終能先破底綫、但成績二十五秒八、</p>
<p>▲甲八百公尺有論及小學體育者、則均主張徑賽祇多以四百公尺爲長距離跑、蓋年齡幼稚、精氣神三者俱未充足、昨日之八百公尺與賽者、除冠軍尙文傅元祥、尙能應付外、餘子皆到達終點、但均有力竭聲嘶之神態、</p>
<p>▲百十低欄和安高連　爲是項之天材、倘能許其苦心造詣、則前程大有希望、觀夫過欄姿勢之優美、將達終點之衝刺、莫不儼然有老儒之身乎、尙文沈如新起步有程金冠之雄姿惜後勁尙弱、成績十五秒六、尙屬不惡、</p>
<p>▲急行跳遠朱洪琪又點首席、次名華志　亦驃悍可喜兩兩相較、初差者極微、此項紀錄爲五公尺七一、尙待時日、必能活躍於壇毡之上、</p>
<p>▲撑竿跳高撑杆跳高須洪根過竿時多爲滾式、姿勢尙須糾正、而第四名之廣公、小小黑炭何東純、成績雖不及前三名然其在第六七八次與其他爭奪、均在第三次、卒被獲四、殊不易也雖不佳妙、但絶不可以其小而忽之、當須</p>
<p>洪根最後搗竿而起之精神、良堪嘉佩也、</p>
<p>▲乙丙二百公尺萬竹蘇龍章以善於衝刺而獲冠軍、和安和根龍雖居第三、尙允其游刃有餘、而鄭良至與談紀鎬、均爲小將中之奇士、起步與終點之力反拚、有成人之神氣、</p>
<p>▲八百公尺接力尙文獨多二百公尺之角色、若朱愛賢若胡士華若沈如新輩胥皆虎視耽耽者、第一棒萬竹曾較佔優勢、二棒卽萎縮特甚、及至第四棒朱洪琪雖稱饒勇、亦難起死回生矣、</p>

<h3 id="c235">學生們怎樣實行新生活？ <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>「新生活，新生活。」多麽時髦的一個口號。新生活的目的：是在建設國家和復興民族的基礎！提高國民智識和道德！在使一般國民的衣、食、住、行能整齊，淸潔，簡單，樸素。合乎禮、義、廉、恥！可見新生活的目的是多麽重大！多麽緊要！</p>
<p>我們學生是將來國家的主人翁，救國的責任都在我們的肩頭上。我們是實行新生活的先鋒隊，所以我們應該要明瞭怎樣實行新生活。</p>
<p>最重要的大槪有左列的二點：</p>
<p>（一）規矩：我們做人非守規矩不可，所以新生活的規條裏，也有規矩這一條。早晨見了人，應該說聲「早」。分别的時候，說聲「再會」。諺語說：「呌人不蝕本，舌上打個滾。」吃飯的時候，不可有魯莽的舉動。走路要靠左邊。規矩的條文很多，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>（二）淸潔：淸潔是延年益壽的要訣，所以新生活的條文中也有淸潔這一條。衣服宜常洗，窗户要常開，指甲要常剪，頭髮要常梳。</p>
<p>我想一定有人要說：「這樣多的條文，要一條一條去實行，這是多麽困難，多麽麻煩呀。」事實上這有什麽艱難呢？怕麻煩做什麽人呢？祗要每天實行一二條，不到一二月，你便實行了新生活了。</p>
<p>小月友們，我想你們眞的一定不怕困難和麻煩的。</p>
<h3 id="c236">五月的故事 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 丁合</p>
<p>五月的一個晚上，英弟和蘭妹，正爲着一塊糕，槍得扭打的時候；　　爸爸從外回来；他們見了爸爸，就丢去了糕，上前呌爸爸。</p>
<p>爸爸對他們，却只笑笑，就在旁邊的一隻椅子上坐下。以後，就呌他們坐在一旁，也呌我坐在旁邊。</p>
<p>爸爸先開口問弟弟，現在是幾月。</p>
<p>英弟很快的說是「五月」。爸爸再問蘭妹，蘭妹也很快的說「五月」。爸爸又問我。</p>
<p>「五月是五月，不過，我們應當呌他國恥月才是。」</p>
<p>等我說完，爸爸點點頭說「很對」。但是英弟蘭妹，奇怪起來。在這時，爸爸就嘆息說：</p>
<p>「祗是記着，不想雪恥，已經不是我們應當做的事情，你們，不但不想雪恥，而且記都不記得」。</p>
<p>於是英弟蘭妹哭了，這時候，爸爸反笑起來，就把五月的一段故事，從頭到底，細細的告訴他們。</p>
<p>爸爸講完了五月的故事，英弟說：「我們要聯合中國的小朋友，一起起來雪恥，一起起來雪恥。」</p>
<h3 id="c237">手足之爭 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 胡藴五</p>
<p>某日，手與足互爭貴賤，手駡足道：「世界上没有比你「足」的輕賤。爲什麽呢，第一你的足掌，終日踏在地上，永不見天日，第二你的尊容「足」，倘若拿起來給人看，人都要駡你知敬了。」足笑道：「試問我污穢的時候，洗我足的，不是你「手」嗎？你要去拿東西，倘若我不肯移動，你能拿得到嗎？」手爲足所詰質，弄得閉口難言，足又說道：天下無論什麽事，没有貴賤可分的，各有各的用處，總要相互帮助，才能够發生效用。</p>
<h3 id="c238">動物的脚 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>小朋友！我們把各種大小動物來研究，是非常有興味的。單從它們的『脚』來講，已經形形色色，非常有趣啊。</p>
<p>陸地上的動物，都是有脚的。水中的動物，有的脚變爲鯺：有的脚上生了蹼：這是甚麽緣故呢？因爲在陸上走的動物，有脚方可步行；在水裏的動物，有鯺或蹼，方可游水。這都是適應環境的緣故。</p>
<p>猛獸的脚，有爪，爲便於裂噬别的動物之用。脚底有厚肉，所以走的時候，没有聲響；跳的時候，不會損傷；像虎，豹，貓，獅等食肉類的脚，都是這樣的。懦笨的獸，脚下有蹄，有的雙蹄，有的單蹄；所以有蹄類動物，分爲偶蹄，奇蹄兩種，像象，牛，羊等，便是有蹄類的動物。</p>
<p>鳥是飛行的動物，有脚還有爪。昆蟲類都是六隻脚。鴨善游水，脚裏生蹼；蛙類亦然；很像行舟的有槳呀。魚的腹鯺，胸鯺像槳，尾鯺像舵，眞是有趣咧。</p>
<p>蛇，蛔蟲，蟯蟲，螩蟲没有脚，全靠身體的蠕動而移動的。蛙，鹿，後脚長，前脚短；所以跳躍極快。蟹八脚，長頸鹿丨也許便是古人所說的『麒麟』丨頸項過高，都是横行的。鳥類前面兩脚，變爲翅膀，所以能够飛了。</p>
<h3 id="c239">布穀鳥 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>

<p>老農感激你；提醒割麥，</p>

<p>你不愧爲益鳥！</p>

<p>— 林軟</p>
<p>小月友丨你們可知道英國大發明家斯蒂文生嗎？你所看見的火車，便是他所發明的。他是採煤公司火夫的兒子，小時候只替人家牧羊，十四歲的時候，他便帮助他父親做事了。但是一面却暗暗裏讀書。後來他的父親死了，全家的衣服，可憐全靠他一個人來負擔的，那時他又死去了他的妻子，他的傷心是說不出的。</p>
<p>但是不怕困難的斯蒂文生，却不顧自己能力的足不足，開始研究科學，第一次他發明煤礦裏的安全燈，第二次，他又發明交通的利器火車了。就在利物浦到孟却斯脫的路公告表演，看的人都喝着采，祝他的成功，但是一八四八年，他就死去了。</p>
<p>小朋友，奮鬥的人，卽使環境不好，也阻撓不住的，</p>
<h3 id="c241">寫給城市中小月友的信 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 許宗傑</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>你們的天眞，活潑，快樂，多麽的呌人歆羨，所以我放棄了一個小老頭兒丨丨我已近四十的人了丨丨的資格，成天價和小朋友厮混在一起，做一個年紀最大的老弟弟。</p>
<p>小朋友們！我現在是住在鄉間，也可以稱做鄉下的老弟弟。在初夏的時候，鄉間有些甚麽影色？我們玩些甚麽？不妨報告一些給諸位聽聽。</p>
<p>田裏的秧針，已有二寸來長，成行成列的挿着。菜花已結子了，豌豆也成實了，一種小鳥，呌着快快布穀！快快布穀！四隣年壯的哥兒，開始赤着腿，捋着臂，下田去工作。</p>
<p>我和小朋友們早上已五點多鐘齊起身，在田岸上走着跳着，草間微微有些濕露，東方的太陽，也開始露出它緋紅的臉面。我們看看田中的秧針，看看溪中的蝌蚪，也聽聽那枝頭的鳥鳴。這樣的走了一小時，各自回家去進早餐，上學，做工作。</p>
<p>黄昏，是我們最快樂的時候。一大片柔軟碧綠的草坪，便是我們的遊戲塲，天然椅。好多小朋友在上邊踢着球，或是賽跑，跳高。我們採了許多的野花，編成了王冕，給優勝者戴上。玩倦了便躺在上面，講講故事，唱唱山歌，直等到太陽沉西，喊口號的蝦蟆先生，閣閣閣喊着散會，我們便各自回去。</p>
<p>小朋友們！這一些簡單的報告，你們覺得怎樣？你們願意要嘗試這鄉間的生活嗎？我極歡迎你們的加入，祝你們快樂。你的老弟弟許宗傑上。</p>
<h3 id="c242">地球是什麽樣子的？ <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>小朋友！你們可知道地球是什麽樣子的？</p>
<p>地球的形狀，是一個球形。說得更正確些，他的形狀，是像橘子一樣的。小朋友若是不相信地球是圓的，你可到海邊去，遠望從前面來的船。我們先看見船的烟囱，到後來纔能看見船身。你想地球基是平的，應當般身烟囱一起看見，怎會有這種現象呢？</p>
<p>在月蝕的時候，我們能够看見月亮上有圓的影子。這個影子，就是地球反射到月亮上去的影子。黑影是圓的，當然地球也是圓的了。</p>
<p>小朋友也許要問，地球是圓的，而且常常在運動，爲什麽我們一些也不覺得呢？你也以把一個螞蟻捉在皮球上面，把皮球很快的旋轉，但是螞蟻仍舊能够一些也不覺得的向前行走。這是因爲皮球太大，螞蟻太小了。我們就像許多的螞蟻，地球却是一個極大的皮球。</p>

<p>兒童感學的靈敏與否，在先天的生理方面果然有相當關係，但是後天的行爲訓練，却也非常重要；假使一個天資愚笨，感覺遲鈍的兒童，能給予他很適當的訓練，雖然趕不上一個天才兒童，但是，至少可以超越平時不曾受過感覺訓練的兒童。最好的訓練方法，就是遊戲。這送雞蛋的遊戲，就是訓練兒童感覺靈敏的方法之一。</p>
<p>做遊戲的人數，並没有限制，不過太小了要减少些興趣，太多的時候，又會使猜的感到困難，所以最適當是五人至十人。遊戲垢地點，也不限在那裏，室内户外都可以。在未開始以前，先選出一個做送蛋人，一個做猜測人。其餘的人，把兩手背在身後靠牆際。猜測人將眼緊閉，離開靠牆站立的人約十數步。送蛋人凖備小皮球一個，或石子一顆，代表蛋。嘴裏可以唱着：「雞媽媽送蛋有誰要？有誰要？」一面將蛋給任何一個兒童後，再說：「送掉了。猜猜看，猜着送你吃！」猜測人就走近站在牆際的兒童跟前，觀察他們的臉色，猜出是送給誰的。倘若猜中以後，受蛋的就和猜測的互調。猜不中的再重猜，三次猜不中就要罰唱歌，或講故事。送蛋人在送蛋時可以多掉換或贈送後，再授給某一個蛋。受蛋的或未受蛋的兒童，在猜測時，可以故意裝着特異的菜態，使猜測人不易觀察。</p>

<p>鵲呌報喜，鴉鳴兆凶，這是一種迷信，鵲和鴉是個鳥類，它如何知道人的吉凶呢？不過有些人明知道不足爲憑，可是聽得鵲呌，不由表示愉快；聽得鴉鳴，不由表示厭惡；共實鴉知反哺，是個孝鳥，並不是什麽大壞的東西，人偏偏每逢它開口，就要詛咒它，眞要替它不平了。但是鴉鳴是哇哇哇的，帶着一種愁苦之音，令人起不快的感觸，有些厭聽，若是那個鴉不識相，對人點頭磕腦，不斷哇哇呌的，還要拾起石子，抛着將它驅逐，這不是我們常見到的嗎，鵲呌雖然没有什麽特别好，比較的有精神，能動聽，所以少呌無妨，多呌無碍，，總是到處受人歡迎。</p>
<p>小朋友，我們由這上面，可以見到人的說話，也要得法，作文有文法，習字有字法，學畫有畫法，說話怎能没有方法呢？古來小學有「應對之節，」就是研究說話：聖門有「言語一科，」也是注重說話；若是說話不得法，任憑你學問品性，怎樣的好，可是每逢出言，常易招怨招忌，到處碰壁，就同烏鴉一般，開口使人唾棄，怎樣向社會上去挿足呢？</p>

<h3 id="c250">關於托兒所與兒童公育 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>自上海市有創辦「托兒所」的消息後，引起了一般人的注意。五月十三日本報增刊上，有師石君的「關於托兒所與兒童公育」一文。是反對托兒所的，大意說：「歐美各國的兒童公育，雖已有見諸實施與成效，但以我國現」時的社會情况，國民經濟，文化程度與家庭觀念等。認爲要推行兒童公育，尙有疑」。所持反對的理由，大約不外以不兩點：（一）反對婦女從事職業，不顧育兒。（二）對兒童公育的本身懷疑。</p>
<p>關於第一點師石君謂：「現在中國一般婦女的從事職業，實際上祇是嚮賣短時的靑春，···婚後社會旣不能爲一般育有兒女的母親留着相當的職位，那末托兒所當然亦失去了存在的必要，况婦女有育兒的天職，扶育兒女使身心健全，就是服務社會，而其價値，勝過在機關充當花瓶或商塲中當活牌的職業。」婦女的需要從事職業，卽使抛去主義理論，僅就中國現狀講，連年因帝國主義的侵略，内亂的瀕存，農村破產，市面蕭條，中產以下的家庭婦女，已有不得不向外尋求職業，以圖一飽，於中上人家的婦女，旣已有受教育的機會，一有知識技能，自然她也要發展她的本能，從事於政治，學術，或其他職業，以盡其所能。所以婦女的從事職業，已是現社會下的必然現象了。一方旣有職業婦女，他方旣有代育兒童機關的必要。一方得專心工作，一方得多量教育。喜工作者工作，喜教養兒童者，則教養兒童。對個人可謂分工，對社會可謂合作。至所謂從事職業，祇是出賣短時的靑春，誠屬侮蔑職業婦女之詞，但我們也不能否認，確有許多職業婦女，婚後卽抛了職業，或不能再從事職業，前者是粥少僧多的社會的現象使然，後者原因固不一，但因缺少代育子女之機關，亦有以致之。</p>
<p>關於第二點，師石君以爲因兒童公育，會破壞天倫，所以有「兒童與家庭有不可須臾離的相互關係，兒童是家庭幸福中心···兒孫繞膝才能搆成天倫之樂···家庭又是兒童的樂園，父母之愛，是兒童生命上唯一的糧食，否則便難生存，」師石君還憧憬着兒孫繞膝的那種封建式的安樂鄉，其實人事日繁，謀生不易的現社會下，尙要享這安閒的天倫，中下的人家，事實上已是不可能了。况托兒所與中國固有育嬰堂不同，托兒所養育的兒童，仍得按時歸家，與父母團聚。至於家庭是否兒童的樂園，實屬疑問，而事實告訴我們中國一般的家庭，是兒童的地獄，富者不知教，不知養，只知驕寵；貧者，連養也談不到。且中國兒童，都因習於家庭生活，缺少集團的陶冶，一般散沙似的習性，半由家庭生活所養成。他如父母之愛，固爲兒童的精神糧食，但溺愛與利己的愛丨丨父母視兒女是玩物，是私產丨丨愛之適以害之，不但害及子女個人，且貽患社會，中國兒童死亡率之大，無與比倫，原因固多，但亦不外不會教，不會養，與飢寒之所致，在此情形下，正應有公共的較有科學方法的教養之必要。</p>
<p>關於收費一層，按諸先進國家的通例，多以幼兒父母的收入爲比例，與兒童的數量無關。</p>
<p>師石君末謂：「事實上却徒爲一般沾花惹草的紈袴子弟大開方便之門，結果恐將成爲私生子與姦生子之尾閭。」年來人慾横流，已爲週知的事實，那末私生子與姦生子之泛濫，也許是必然的現象，這種不良的現象，是社會的病態，私生子或姦生子本生是無罪的。况中華民族，前爲四萬萬，現在或不足此數，爲復興民族計，我以爲不管他是私生子或公生子，都有設法使他健全長育之必要。所以我慶幸上海不久將有托兒所的出現，我更希望各都市鄉鎭多多的設立，不過，我希望辦托兒所的，務求科學化，切忌貴族化，更希望爲貧苦兒童大開方便之門。</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>七歐文</p>
<p>歐文（Ｒobert　Owen）是英國的一位大空想家，生於一七七一年，逝於一八五八年，這個時候，英國生產中技術的進步，已把大量的熟練手工業者變爲機器附屬品，或是完全排斥於生產以外而代以不熟練的弱婦幼兒，也就是資本主義「罪惡猖獗」的時期，整批整批的靑年兒童，因在工廠裏受着慘苦的剥削而死掉了。歐文生逢斯世，目睹種種慘象，便使他由一個大實業家和人道主義者變爲澈底的社會改良家。</p>
<p>他從事社會改良的範圍，包括很廣，如保護兒童，辦教育，設學校，成立托兒所，保護工廠勞動，開辦醫院，救濟老人與失業者等。歐文爲實現自己的理想，企圖成立一種共產公社，以代替舊的垂死的制度。可是他不懂，勞工的經濟解放和脫離奴隸制度，須是勞工本身的事。歐氏相信，各黨派的「賢明而識見高遠的人，」均可共同地實現必要的改良。</p>
<p>歐文在十歲的時候，他父親令他到鄉下一個商店裏做學徒，後來他在倫敦和曼切斯特兩大都市裏又作事幾年。一七九○年，歐文以十九歲的靑年，做了曼切斯待（此地當時已爲英國的紡織工業中心）</p>
<p>一個大紗廠的經理。越七年，他又聯合友人，在蘇格蘭的一個紐蘭納克地方，用一百二十五萬馬克買了一所紗廠，有男女工人和兒童三千名。此廠便做了他改良社會計劃的試騐所。</p>
<p>歐氏頭一件事，便是注意兒童。他設了好多托兒所，收容半歲以上的小孩，以期减輕有小孩的女工的苦担。他在自己所辦的學校裏取消了賞罰兒童辦法；他的工廠也不收十歲以下的兒童作工：十歲以上者，規定工作時間爲十二半小時，此在當時算是一巨大的進步，因爲那時甚至四歲的一個小孩在工廠裏都要作工十二至十六小時的。</p>
<p>一八二五年，歐文爲實現自己的新社會制度的理想起見，又在美國印第安州購置了一塊土地，成立了一個共產團體，呌做『新恊和社』。歐氏在這里有好多卓絶的男女戰友，内中有個布萊特女士者，在婦女運動上尤起有重大的作用，她個人在『新恊和社』内又成立了一個小團體。在『新恊和社』的試騐失敗後，布萊特女士又奮鬭多年，爭取婦女的平權。</p>
<p>歐文認爲女性是和男子天生而平等的，並没有服從男子的義務，他並且很勇敢地把自己的信念實施於生活，雖然這曾引起社會上對他的狂暴的攻擊，但他仍是不屈的。在『新恊和社』裏，婦女享有選舉權和被選權。他在他兒子所辦的『少年美國』雜誌上，曾發表了自己的十二條要求，内中一條是『男女應當完全平等』。</p>
<p>歐文深信人類最高理想的力量。他企圖造一種新的，更完善的，集體的社會生活制度的榜樣，來對抗當時的殘暴的剥削。不論在那一方面，他都表露了很豐富的思想，此種思想在當時曾爲嘲笑譏刺的對象，而在現在則成了國際社會主義的寳物了。</p>
<p>至歐氏關於婚姻，賣淫，婦女職業，兒童教育等問題的意見，俟下次再說罷。</p>
<h3 id="c252">媚態運動與婦女解放 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 炯</p>
<p>美國的克里扶倫地方，新近正在提倡一種婦女的媚態運動，</p>
<p>據說這種媚態運動的興起，是基於取悅於男子而來的。因爲男人們都覺得：塗脂抺粉的女子，簡直是一座花瓶，没有靈魂似的祇可供人玩賞吧了。這樣不但不能演出活潑的姿態，且對健康上，也有着不良的影響：怎能呌「君子好逑」呢？於是乎她們站在取悅於男人的立塲上，尋出了：（一）因爲嘂肺病的女子，日見增多，非提倡媚態運動，不易却病延年。（二）發揮媚態也就是女子鍜鍊身體的機會，使身體日見健康，病魔無從侵入。（三）女子拿脂粉來裝飾面孔不算是美，必須具有妖媚的姿態纔算十足的美。（四）須從媚態上痛下工夫，然後可到處受着男子們的追求。這些理由，而發動了媚態之動：到處開演講會，貼標語，甚且各個婦女團體都附設有媚態專修學校，教育見男子之媚，向愛人之媚，對丈夫之媚，以及叙情之媚，戀愛之媚，問候之媚，告别之媚，行走之媚等，使其成爲一取悅男人的能手而後已。難道說這對於婦女解放運動能有所補益麽？</p>
<p>我們知道婦女之所以居於被壓迫的地位者，是由於社會制度經濟條件所使然，這，祗要我們翻一翻社會進化史及婦女解放運動史，便可明白個底細。而美利堅的娘子們竟在嗜飽了脂粉味之後，翻個新花樣：他們滿以爲從媚態上痛下工夫，到處受着男子們的追求，顯示她們的健康，嬌傲，便算解放（？）這簡直是欺人自欺的笑話！</p>
<p>我們如果是以爲從西洋來的東西，總是「摩登」的，而把這媚態學了來，那我們這二萬萬在雙重壓迫下的婦女，就不啻自已解除了武器，取消了要求解放的戰鬥的陣營了。因爲這種媚態運動，出現在我們眼前的，是一個取悅於男人的姿態。是一塊阻礙婦女解放運動的前途的巨石。是一杯麻醉的湯藥。因此，我們應該堅决地防堵這媚態運動的侵入，而更堅强我們婦女運動的陣綫，從經濟上，政治上去努力奮鬥，然後才能獲得眞正的解放啊！</p>

<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>不久之顡　，美國南大科州（Ｓ·Ｄakota）發生了一椿轟動社會的雙生子能彀有兩個父親的奇案，而且當地法庭，爲了這事情，還開了世界上從未有過的新判例。讀者們，你們相信嗎？這確是眞的呢，因爲在那個州的蒲里曼村裏有個農民名呌亞德瓦巴德的，他有兩個一胎生的孩子，其中一個的容貌和巴德很酷肖，而另一個，却一些也不像巴德，所以巴德很懷疑，又因他的妻曾和别人姘居，巴德拿到了証據，于是爭執就開始了。巴德說：他只能對他自己的孩子（就是那個面貌相像的）盡父親的義務，至還有那一個，决不是他的孩子，只能讓母親去負責。結果，他們兩口兒就閙到了州裏的法庭上，自然，巴德的理由是很充足的，法庭經數度訊問，推事杜利伯終于宣判了准于巴德的請求，由夫婦分負兩子的扶養。照這麽說來，雙生子不是眞能有兩個父親了嗎？</p>

<p>「你是不對！」</p>
<p>先生：</p>
<p>第十期婦女園地上登載着你底一段悲史，末了，，你說；『有誰肯對我說「你是對的」，或「你是不對」嗎』？據我運用我所有的淺薄的知識來『批判』（？）我敢肯定地說：『你是不對！』</p>
<p>請你不要疑心我是在抺着良心說話。在替我底同性辯護。</p>
<p>第一：我覺得當你們正開始相愛着的時候，你當然得運用你所有的能力去觀察你底對象。現在的報章雜誌上不是充滿着婚姻欺騙的新聞嗎？你能够驟然相信你底對象不會就是那些新聞裏的主角嗎？細看你底「婦人心」你却似乎並没有注意到這一點。</p>
<p>第二：你旣然知道了在你們相愛不久之前，他曾熱戀着另外一個女人；你就應當去探知他的爲何同他第一個戀人破裂和如何同他第一個戀人破裂。當然，他會用欺騙的不正當手段來同你脫離，他底同他第一個戀人的脫離手段也一定不外乎仍舊是欺騙的或其他的不正當的方法。但據你說，你却知道了」據說是她不肯答應他的要求，便破裂了。」這一點。</p>
<p>他會因爲他底第一個戀人不答應他的或種要求而和她破裂，你能擔保他不會因你不答應他再另愛一個女人的要求而和你破裂嗎？</p>
<p>第三：你底好友旣然警告你『你能相信他不會再去熱戀第三個女人嗎？』你爲什麽又驟然相信呢？他會打碎他先生送給他的寳貴的琵琶，就表示着他是一個善于忘記朋友的傢伙。會寫血書者往往就是意志最薄弱的人。會用死來要挾的人也就是人類中最壞的敗類。你不能爲了他的血書就感動；你不能爲了他的「死」就抛棄你底懷疑和猶豫。死！你不知道許多東北的同胞被暴日慘殺列死嗎？你不知道許多西北的同胞被天災淹餓死嗎？你不知道許多圓顱方趾的平民被武人槍殺死嗎？死了一個會打碎他先生送他的寳貴的琵琶而用之以騙取異性的愛情的人有什麽了不得呢！</p>
<p>還有第四：你不能恨你底心爲什麽不「狠」不「毒」。你底失敗並不在於你底心的不「狠」不「毒」，而在於你底腦袋欠理智化！你底心太容易感動。</p>
<p>有此四點，所以我敢說你不對。但是，先生，你是湖南人，湖南人和廣東人同是我國最勇敢的人，最善進取的人，最會革命的人，和最有希望的人。敬祝你能利用我湖南人的血液去打破你前途的渺茫！</p>

<h3 id="c287">我們需要怎樣的選舉 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 立秋</p>
<p>最近幾週以來，公樸先生在本刊上曾幾次提了了關於改良選舉的問題。自然，這一問題目前不僅在促進市政或地方自治等實際情形上具有重要的意義，同時，就在中國整個的政治改造上說來，都是一個待解决的重要問題。</p>
<p>儘管中國過去的許多次選舉，是在不健全的情形之下而失敗了，但是，這絶不能說是「選舉」本身的罪過。因爲選舉只是一種方法，凡是人們要將社會事務之最後的裁判權操在多數人手裏的時候，則除了選舉的方法而外，根本上再也没有旁的方法了。</p>
<p>所以，現在我們要求地方自治與改良選舉，實際上卽是要救民治精神的發揮，我們以爲這是從政治改造上挽救民族危機之最低限度的工作。</p>
<p>因而，現在的問題，不是我們需不需要改良選舉，主要的是我們需要怎樣的選舉。關於這點，我以爲：</p>
<p>第一，我們需要的是普選丨丨近代選舉權之逐漸擴張，已經使過去的階級選舉進步到普通選舉了。因此，我們要求廢際宗教，經濟，社會，性别的一切限制。除了未成年的兒童，神經病的患者及剥奪了公權的人而外，人人都能有參加選舉的義務與權利。</p>
<p>第二，我們要求選舉實權的擴大丨丨選舉權之價値，主要的要在民選官吏的數目上才能表現出來。人民之參加選舉，不只是替政府選出諮詢機關，同時，更重要的是要選出能代表他們意見的人，直接參加一切國家或地方重大問題之澈底解决和執行。所以，我們要求選舉的實權應當擴大，同時，還要救創制，複决，罷免等權的實施丨因爲這三者是有連帶關係的。</p>
<p>第三，在選舉方法上的注意丨丨我們知道：選舉權的價値和效力與投票方法有很大的關係。公開選舉，不能充分發揮選舉者的意志，同時「圈定的」選舉方式根本失掉了選舉的意義。現在，各國的選舉制度，都差不多改爲無記名投票制度了，因此，我們也要求在中國的一切選舉上實用這一選舉的方式。</p>
<p>第四，應當實施强制選舉丨丨選舉權不僅是人民的一種權利，同時也是一種義務。選舉是一種公共職務，國家對於人民的這種職務，必須用盡方法使之履行。我國大多數人，過去對於選舉往往漠不開心，一方面給土豪劣紳和野心的政客所操縱，同時，又使人民對於政治毫無興趣，所以，我們主張，政府應當效法比利時，荷蘭，捷克，西班牙等國家，實施强迫選舉制度，規定不參加選舉者須受經濟上或名譽上之某種懲罰。</p>
<p>第五，要求嚴格的選舉舞弊法律丨丨選舉舞弊是我國過去的一種通常現象，現在，我們不談選舉則已，一談選舉，在積極方面，我們要求提高一般人民的政治水平，在消極方面，我們要求一個嚴格的選舉舞弊法律。國家須用法律規定凡賄賂，欵待，威嚇，冐名，以及非法利用選舉費，或選舉運動者，都須給以嚴格的懲處。</p>
<p>上列幾項，是我們改良選舉之最低限度的要求。有人說這只是一個不能實現的高調，其實，我們知道，倘若工使一個選舉能够眞正代表民意，要使一個選舉的結果，能够得到大多數民衆的擁護，除了以上列幾點爲基礎的選舉以外，我們還有什麽更好的方法呢？所以，我們希望辦選舉的當局，應當以此爲目標去促進健全的選舉之實施。無論是中央的政治，地方自治以及社會團體，倘若不能有完善的健全的選舉，則一切理想都是不能達到的丨</p>
<p>誠然，「有選舉勝於無選舉」，但是，僅僅「有選舉」還是不够的，我們還要在「有選舉」之中要求更加完善的選舉啊！</p>

<h3 id="c288">血飯 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 龍萊</p>
<p>生存在這「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」的不合理的社會裏，一般嗅不到酒肉，輾轉在飯寒死亡綫上的人，爲了要活，有的就不得不忍痛着廉價地拍賣自己的勞動力，有的甚至於賤賣了親生的兒女，硬拿自己身體上的血液去換得殘羹冷飯來飽肚皮，這就是這兒要說的一般給高貴的人們雇用去做奶媽的勞苦婦女了。</p>
<p>只消走到北平的「傭工介紹所」，上海的「薦頭店」，或是成都的「人巿」，重慶的「會府」這些地方過趟路，我們就會瞧見這般「賣人血者」展覽品樣地，排排地蹲着，坐着等待出賣。噙着離夫别子之苦淚的眼飢餓地關心地釘着過往的行人，好容易等到一個主顧走進來，就唯恐差池地把一對茄子樣的奶子，直挺挺地捧出來任憑人們擇肥選瘦地檢騐，摸擦。結果，得售者就又悲又喜，跟着主人去了（多半要去受醫生的血液檢騐）。被挑剩選餘了撇下來的呢，就垂頭喪氣地再等待主顧。這一切誰見了不感到是一齣悽慘的悲劇？「賣人血者」比起一般出賣勞動者不還要可憐些嗎？</p>
<p>自然，要拿自己的血水給貴人們的公子小姐去吮吸，首先得把自己親生的兒女抛在一邊：較好的是花點錢寄託在别人屋裏，或是留在家中喂米湯，否則的話，無可寄託或没人招料，就只得忍着痛，乾脆送給别人跟抛棄在路畔或弄口了。這樣地去做奶媽的人，當她抱着人家的孩子哺喂自己的奶水時，心上該如何深沉地感着慘痛呀！尤其是看着别人的孩兒張着小嘴向自己笑，伸着小手身自己招得可愛的時候。</p>
<p>拿責任跟工作來說，奶媽和普通一般的娘姨大姐表面上似乎没有什麽區分，而實際上却比之娘姨大姐艱苦更大的多了。她們不但負着哺喂孩子的職責，而且還得担當孩子的發育，健康，疾病，衛生等等的重任，因此她們一經被人雇用，身體跟行動方面就完全失掉了自由。記得有過這樣的悲喜劇：有個兩夫婦都自命爲教育家的公館裏，女主人天天督責着奶媽在她老共瓜皮樣的臉兒上，擦些雪花膏，搽些水粉，說是她的臉子生得太醜，女孩吃她的奶，恐怕將來要　她。這樣一來，她那被霜風吹粗，因勞動而憔悴的臉皮就給雪花膏跟粉醃漬得發燒發痛了，結果她對着鏡子，哭也不是，笑也不是。說到行動，那簡直同牢獄的囚犯没有兩樣，因爲小少爺或小姐，不能半天一夜不吃奶，她們就老是一年半載不得回家，明明是有夫之婦，可是主人偏偏要她守「活寡」。不僅這樣，就是隨便在街上或是鄰居家裏走走也得被干涉的。要是孩子偶爾傷了風，打個噴嚏，那末主人更要責駡她抱着孩子亂走所以遭凉了，勵害一點的主人還得拿「扣工錢」，「滾蛋」這些來壓制她。</p>
<p>換洗孩子的衣服，尿布，抱着孩子玩，喂奶，不分晝夜地搖搖籃，這是做奶媽的一般的工作，另外，買菜，煮飯，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>做針綫這些也不得不做。如果孩子稍爲大點，漸漸地長了牙，睡眠的時間减少了，勉强能够爬行的時候，這時奶媽的工作，可就不輕鬆的了，隨時隨地得留心地防禦他跌倒，連睡覺的時候也不得擅離職守。這時候的孩兒，一舉一動都不像初生時那樣的規矩，拿他吃奶來說吧，在他將要生出小牙齒之前，吃奶時會緊緊地咬着奶子摩擦牙齦，旣出之後，又要用他瓜子大的幾辦新牙來撕咬奶頭，常常把奶媽撕咬得臉上起了痙攣，但她却不得怨恨一句，酸淚只好悄悄地往肚子裏硬嚥下去。人吃人呀，這眞是！</p>
<p>到了八九個月的孩子，食量也比先前增加了，奶媽總是虚心地怕自己的乳汁不能滿足他，同時一方面還得慇懃地對主人表示她的奶好丨丨害怕飯碗發生問題。因此無論白天或是夜裏只要孩子一哭，她就馬上把奶子塞進他的嘴裏，讓那吸血哭慢慢地吮吸，縱然有時候吸疼了她的肉，吞空了她的血，她得忍住痛苦。</p>
<p>狼籍杯盤裏的殘湯剩菜，便是主人給與奶媽的唯一的飲食，穿着是他們壓箱櫃底子的發了霉的舊衣舊褲。至於她們的工資，最高的也不過十塊錢，六塊或八塊是最流行的時價。如果她們自己的孩子還留着請人替養的話，那末，除開自己孩子的養育費，所賺得的冷飯殘羹外，只是一身貧血的瘦骨了，這是「賣血者」的代價，這是吃血飯者的生活。</p>
<h3 id="c289">國文教師 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 文宇</p>
<p>人們都知道國文教師是教書匠中最辛苦酌一種人，但展開在他們生活上的到底是怎樣一幅勞瘁的圖畫，是人們未必全淸楚的。在過去的一年中，我有這榮幸，能在本市的一個私立中學裏作過這麽一位先生。我不能說我眞有多少的體騐，但我不否認我確有若干的觀察。</p>
<p>首先，我需要提出的，是社會上對這輩教書先生的不正確的觀念。他們以爲教育是淸高的，便以爲教師，特别是國文教師，是不曾染上一些人間烟火氣的高人逸士。但事實是絶對的相反，他們不但不是什麽高人逸士，不但和一般人一樣需要麵包，且不得不爲麵包作劇烈的生存鬥爭。在這人才過剩？）時代，爲抓緊自己的飯碗，他們不得不用種種方法提防着競爭者丨雖欲淸高亦不可得。</p>
<p>現在我且在這裏展示他們生活的灰暗面。不顧健康，不顧能力，他們是常兼着兩個三個甚至四個以上學校的課。他們有教課多至五六班的。論鐘點，有每週任課三十六小時的。完全是把身體當作機哭般的在使用着。這裏幾乎全談不上教學效率；我們只見一羣混飯吃的人在掙扎中蠕動而已。</p>
<p>這原因顯然是待遇上的過分菲薄，兼之以欠薪，以致他們每月辛勞所得，尙時有不能養活家口之虞。在這種情况下，有什麽好法子呌他們注意教學效率，少担任些鐘點呢？</p>
<p>按照中國目前教育界的普通情形，他們辛勞的代價是按時　値的，依着公私立學校的性質上以及那學校的發展程度上的差别，而不岂其酬報數目。目前上海有這樣的情形：一個僅有一兩年歷史，學生一百人左右的中學，教師是很難支到薪水，雖然聘書上或許規定着每小時應可領到五角大洋的。他們也不一定完全是「盡義務」，因爲學校到底也替他解决了「食」　「宿」等生活問題。至少是有不出錢而可住一旅館」的好處，可以說是「半義務」性質的。有時，出乎意料之外的，或許每月還可支五元到十元的「車馬費」。</p>
<p>局面較大一點的私立中學，五角錢一個鐘頭的「束修」，國文教師是穏可拿到的。若你在這樣一個學校教每週六小時某一級的國文；則你可到手十二元，這算是你撈到了一筆「香烟錢」。</p>
<p>「老牌」一點的私立中學，國文教師每小時可到手七角至八角錢。有一個我所知道的學校就是這樣：初中一，每小時七角，初中二，七角五分，初中三，八角。（本篇所述多係初中情形。）一塊錢一點鐘的私中，在上海是頂少的。公立初中則大都可到此數目。總之，這和外埠有些省分初中國文教師每小時可支一元，或一元二角五，或一元半的情形是完全不同的了。</p>
<p>待遇雖是這樣的低，但却要求他們加倍的辛勞。國文教師的改削國文課卷，需要比上課更多的時間。没有一個國文教師不對着一些半通不通的卷子頭痛的。平常一個並非老資格的國文教師　一點鐘大槪只能改三四本，效率大一些的也只能改六七本。不過這中間有許多「偷懶」的方法，　就是　目　　　　　　　　記叙文容易改，論文最難。最好是議學生們作　大同小異（甚至千　一律），比如你呌他們照你給的「大綱」寫，或呌他們把一篇文言翻成白話，或作一篇一百多字的「隨筆」等。最省事的是你說一篇短故事呌他們記下來，或提出課文内一篇短文，呌他們删去可省的句子，把這篇文字縮短了。改這樣的卷子十二三本甚至十五六本，僅需要你一小時的時間。記得有一次北新書局爲推銷牠的「混合國語」和「北新文選」招待本市各中學國文教師的席上，有一位身體很好的先生，說他一點鐘可改十五六本卷子，我推想到他或者就是用的這種省事的方法！</p>
<p>有人或者要責備這種先生的不負責，但他們實在也是没有辦法的。他們不但太忙，也太疲倦。平常一位國文教師每週任課二十小時不算多，兩班國文兼任歷史或地理，每天已有三四小時的課堂講授，這使他們不得不帶了疲倦的身體回到家裏，呆對着桌上一百本以上（每班五六十人很普通）的半通不通的卷子發愁。何况一個兼課的國文教師任的鐘點比二十小時還要多呢？</p>
<p>在這樣的情形下，决難有時間從事研究工作的。他們的講授内容不得不貧乏得可憐。他們不得不敷衍學生，討好學生，這樣的先生不得不是一位「馬虎」的先生。這裏還談得到教學效率嗎？</p>
<p>爲了免除「誤人子弟」起見，這樣的先生我是再也不想當了。但是社會不能給人更好的事作，從大學裏所販來的知識，這社會又完全用不着，自己又無别種「專門」，爲了某種必要，雖心裏不想害人，又怎樣可能呢？</p>

<p>— 倉玉</p>
<p>大約在五年前吧，我就被介紹到這個打鐵間裏來了。在我們之中，認爲得到工作是像讀書的人得到官做的情形一樣。</p>
<p>這就是我們工作的地方：沙地上，用鐵板圈着的東一堆西一堆燃着的煤火，被地下通來的鼓風管子裏的風吹着，火燃得非常猛烈，熱度也昇到極高度，同時那黑色的煤灰和黄色的煤烟也一齊飛揚起來了，因爲上面有屋頂，兩邊又有牆壁，於是這間房子的空氣全被這烟灰和煤烟所籠罩着，佔據着了。我剛到這裏工作的時候，眞使人難過得要命，因爲灰和烟的侵襲，眼睛整天的被迫着流眼淚，鼻腔和肺部受着怪味的刺激，呼吸簡直失了常態，但現在却似乎習慣得不覺得了。遇到落雨的天氣，灰和烟出不到門，更使人難受。尤其到了夏天，二十幾堆的猛烈的煤火燒着，如果不是習慣了的人，不熱死也會悶死的。</p>
<p>同其他部份的工人一樣，在七點鐘的時候就開始工作。我們是兩三個人一組，每組佔有一堆煤火，一個鐵凳。我們先將碎煤堆得緊緊的，然後鑿開幾個洞，讓風吹出來，火就可以燃得猛烈了。於是將要做的東西的熟鐵埋到煤火裏面去，用大鉗子夾着，候至燒到一定的成色，就將這堆煤弄開，這時熱氣和怪味一齊冲出來，再用冷水一澆，灰和烟馬上飛揚了，但我們絲毫不敢怠慢地就要把那燒紅的鐵夾到鐵凳上，叮叮噹噹，你一錘，我一錘的打着，打過後，讓它冷了，再放進去燒，燒了又錘，這</p>

<p>— 森君</p>
<p>這是資本社會的一件趣聞。美國勒維阿台州首都里諾這個地方，从地理上看來，不過是貧瘠的西部山地的一個小都會，但他却是世界聞名的離婚市，正和摩納哥是世界聞名的賭博國一　。</p>
<p>思倫特法官，曾在里諾的離婚法庭，十二年中許可了二萬件離婚申請的人，當他六十三歲退職時，他說：「結婚的三分之二是失敗的外科手術，只有離婚。」</p>
<p>「到里諾來離婚罷，把你結婚的幸福再恢復過來！」</p>
<p>在美國，四十八州的法律都各不相同。有的　以爲「神的結合，人不可以使牠離散」，桑斯，加洛萊拉州就絶對不許離氏；哥倫比亞地方，只有姦通事件就許離婚。大多數的州以重犯，遺棄，虐待，等爲離婚理由，申請離婚有居住期間」的必要過程，非在一定地方居住一年到三年不可。可是在勒維阿台州，離婚手續都極簡單。</p>
<p>使勒維阿台州有名的東西，不是雪拉·勒維阿台（西班牙語是有雪的山脈的意思）的雪，不是原始森林，不是鑛山業，而是輕便迅速的離婚法。里諾和巴黎，墨西哥巿合起來，稱世界三大離婚都，同時現在的里諾，也以賭博著名。</p>
<p>約在七十年前，許多人爲了鑛山業到里諾來了，只要居留六個月，就獲得了完全的市民權。</p>
<p>照勒維阿台的離婚法，要是以遺弃，不養育，虐待，申請離婚，而没有抗告的話，就許可單獨離婚；而且離婚後馬上可以再婚。由事都喜歡迅速的美國，這不是没有緣故的。想要離婚的都跑到里諾來，只要住六個月，就可以受到當地法律的恩惠了。</p>
<p>這件事的特别興旺，是在十一二年前開始的，大部分離婚來客都是富有階級，每年總有千人以上，爲此而消耗的金銀達二百萬元，在這一小地方看來，眞是一筆不小的進欵。</p>
<p>因爲大部份富有階級來此游歷並離婚，賭博和跳舞的繁盛也是當然的，但因此來者又更多了。</p>
<p>後來，離婚必要的居住期間六個月减到三個月了，這樣，來客遂愈益增多。</p>
<p>現在把减短居住期間後以及未减以前的外來離婚數字比較一下，就可槪見：</p>
<p>减短之前一九二五年——八○六件</p>
<p>减短之後一九二七年——一，六○三件</p>
<p>全美國經濟不景氣，鑛山業，鐵道工業都不振，里諾許多失業者都改營旅館業，生意倒很好。</p>
<p>一九三一年五月一日以來，三個月居住期間又改爲六週間了，這一來，隣州阿岡蘇和埃台霍的失業者都走到里諾來，分享富有者的浪費。</p>
<p>上等酒，上等的歌舞，總到里諾來，當每年獨立祭（七月四日）的時候，還舉行大鬥拳。　　最近的里諾，每天有一八九件離婚案，而每件離婚案經過六分鐘至十分鐘就辦理完竣了。</p>
<p>辯護士一年可得百萬元，裁判所一年二十六萬元，公共賭博場每週收入百萬元，一年五千二百萬元。</p>
<p>因爲離婚後馬上可以再婚，有不少本地人因而暴富的，一個小菜店的店主竟成爲百萬富豪的女人的對手，賣花姑娘也可勾上名士。</p>
<p>還有點小事，也是値得一記的，就是有許多富有者常把結婚指環抛在里諾的特拉基河裏，一些失業者和遊民一到夜裏就到河裏面淘指環換飯吃。</p>

<p>日裏八個半鐘頭的工作之外，還須得做夜工。但，不作夜工却又是我們絶不願的一回事，你想，我們七八角錢一天的工資好做什麽？不作夜工會連家都養不活！工作愈是低下，工資愈是微少；工資愈是微少，我們愈是希望多作夜工。總之，我們是在同生活拚命啊！</p>
<p>鐵錘一天一天的打着，日曆也一頁一頁的飛去，五年，很快的就過去了。這期間，我想我們錘出了不少的東西，它們總相當地爲人們造些幸福，爲一些人賺得利潤；但是，我們呢？仍舊是「手膀舉酸了」，「手揑痛了」，「汗也出足了」地拍賣勞力！而且，這打鐵間到現在又增加了一些伙伴，更多圍了幾堆煤火了。鐵錘的聲音比從前更響亮些，煤灰和煤烟也比從前更濃密了。</p>

<h3 id="c292">英日在貿易上的衝突 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 雪友</p>
<p>凡是留心到最近國際消息的，對於最近英日商戰的短兵相接以及英日會商的完全失敗，想來不會疏略過去的吧！這裏我們試把這英日商戰的始末簡明地叙述一下。</p>
<p>日本自一九三一年放棄了金本位以來，利用着「金元跌價」的手段，積極地把貿易向世界擴張下去。其結果，一九三二年的輸出貿易額比前一年增加了二億六千三百萬元，總額達十四億一千萬元。一九三三年更積阿邁進，比三二年又增加了四億五千一百萬元，總額達十八億六千一百萬元。這使號稱世界貿易第一位的大英帝國不得不眼紅。</p>
<p>單只是日本貿易額逐漸增大，還不要緊。不幸的是，日本的輸出品有四分之一是專門運銷到英本國及其自治領和殖民地去的。換言之，在一九三三年，日貨之輸往大英帝國的竟達四億八千四百萬日元。其中尤以輸往印度的貨物爲多，達二億零五百萬日元，幾佔大英帝國對日輸入全部的二分之一。</p>
<p>更不幸的是：英國一向是以棉織品稱覇世界的</p>
<p>，對於英屬自治領和殖民地也一向是以棉織品爲輸出的大宗。日本剛剛與英國相抵，牠輸往英屬自治領和殖民地的貨物也正是以棉織物爲中心。計棉織物一項，在一九三三年，從日本輸往英屬各地的，共達一億四千九百萬元（八億七千七百萬平方碼）。印度一域最多，達七千一百萬日元（四億五千一百萬平方碼）。</p>
<p>在同期間，英國輸向印度的棉織物爲四億八千五百萬平方碼。這與日本對印輸出額幾乎相等。</p>
<p>爲了保護自國的棉織工業，爲了鞏固大英經濟集團的勢力起見，英國不得不設計抵禦日本的狂烈襲擊。一九三二年八月，英政府慫恿印度政府修改棉織品的進口關稅，結果日本的棉織品受到從百分之三十一增加到百分之五十的重稅，而英國棉織品的進口稅，仍爲百分之二十五。至一九三三年四月，英外長西門又通知駐英日大使松平，謂將把一九○四年所締結的印日商約於翌年廢止。九月二十五日，日印雙方代表齊集於印度西姆接，會議了半個月，終於得不出結果。後於十月二十三日改在德里舉行會議，幾經磋商，纔於今年一月五日成立了一個恊定。根據這個恊定，日本每年向印度輸出的棉織品不得超過四億平方碼，而日本每年須向印度購買生棉一百五十萬包。日本棉織品進口稅仍爲百分之五十。</p>
<p>日本與印度間的貿易糾紛旣經解决。於是更進一步來談判日本與大英帝國間的貿易問題。今年二月十四日英日民間棉業會議在倫敦開幕，兩方面出席的代表都是各該國的棉業巨子。談判了足足一個月，却終於爲了對於地域適用問題（英國主張，恊議範圍，應包括英日以外第三國之市塲，而日本却主張只限於英本國及其殖民地）而宣告决裂。民間會議决裂以後，於是全部的問題乃移轉到兩國政府來解决。來回磋商了許久，終於得不到頭腦；至本月三日英商相任錫曼以備忘錄交與駐英日大使松平，於是兩國政府間的磋商亦告决裂矣。</p>
<p>英日兩國政府的會商旣告决裂，英政府乃動員全部自治領與殖民地恊力排斥日貨。英日商戰正式開始了。（最近澳外相藍山赴日與廣田外相作初步的貿易談判，現在雖無正式結果，然而由於澳洲是英國自治領地的關係，將來恐怕也没有圓滿的結果。）英國的保守黨（在現内閣中勢力最大）雖然還夢想着「英日同盟」的迷夢，然而事實已是昭然：英國的棉織界再也忍受不了日本的襲繫，此後唯有短兵相接地從事商戰的肉搏而已。</p>
<p>對於英國在新加坡和南洋各地的軍事佈置，對於英荷秘密會議的由來，以及關於日本反對「國際援華」聲中的英國態度，···我們只有從這英日在貿易上之衝突的事實中，纔能把握到眞義。</p>

<h3 id="c293">自學文學——的！幾個基本問題 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>（一）如何覓得研究的門徑</p>
<p>雖然我們研究的出發點是正在活躍中的具象的文學運動，範圍大槪以中國現存的創作及譯品爲界限，是一個較仄的領域。但從事研究之初步的人，應如何來覓得研究的道路呢？這是一個當前的間題。</p>
<p>研究文學從文學史入乎，然後依照文學的流變，挨次去探求各支流，是一種由縱到横的研究法，不失爲自學的一種良法。但在這裏，我們有許多困難：因爲目下成爲我們的對象的是常在變化中的文學，是錯綜複雜矛盾混和的綜合。對這現象就缺少有系統的，像過去文學史那樣較固定的意見與决定。而我們要覓的自學的道路，仍然要去找活的史料，要勤於窺探文壇的組織與行動的消息，要蒐集出版界與各種文學的，非文學的刊物上關於文壇的論文，雜著，批判，軼聞等史料，豐富自已的見解。你從這些材料中，可以看出文學活動之主流與傾向來。你可以對當前複雜的現象有較正確的處理，而不致迷失自己前進的道路。自然，展在你前面的這一條道路，還要由你的意議來决定。</p>
<p>（二）如何增加鑑别的能力</p>
<p>爲了要使自己對現代作品有相當認識的能力，你應有文藝理論的知識。要了解某一派的作品，最好先讀一切關於某一派的文藝理論。理論雖然是從事實歸納出來的，但一種科學的行動是以過去行動中集聚起來的知識作爲理論的出發點。所以科學的行動，是有理論爲其前導的。</p>
<p>我們應有下面幾種基本的知識：</p>
<p>一，關於藝術論</p>
<p>二，關於文藝思潮</p>
<p>三，關於文藝的社會根據</p>
<p>四，關於美學···等較　　專門的研究</p>
<p>這一部分研究，要佔重大的比重，爲研究文學之中心點。由此，你可以完成第一項中應履行的任務。</p>
<p>對於以上諸方面，自然還可以作爲單獨的專門的研究。</p>
<p>祇有這一部分工作做得充分，你才可以發揮你的威力。</p>
<p>（三）文學與其他科學</p>
<p>文學並不是與其他科學無關聯的，孤立的東西。恰恰相反，牠與社會科學及其他的科學都保有了適當配合的關聯。如果要研究文藝理論，就需要有較厚的社會科學及其他科學的基礎。一個缺乏社會科學研究的人，他也不能眞的了解文學，或爲文學者。</p>
<p>一個作家與一個讀者一樣都應深植自己的基礎，同時把自己所學，應用到文學上去？</p>
<p>下面幾種科學，你必須趕快學習。</p>
<p>一，爲了解剖現代社會的，經濟學的基本知識，</p>
<p>二，爲了了解社會進化的道程的，社會學的基本知識；</p>
<p>三，爲了了解社會意識的，社會意識形態的基本知識；</p>
<p>四，關於科學的宇宙觀，世界觀及人生觀這些主題的哲學的基本知識。</p>
<p>（四）文學與生活</p>
<p>文學離不開生活。要了解一篇現代作品，縱令具有以上的理論，如果脫離了實踐的生活，就不能把握時代的重心，且有變成機械論或行而上學的危險。所以一個作家，和一個讀者，同樣應在實踐的生活上去了解文學。</p>

<p>在第一五年計畫時期中，亞麻耕地的面積約擴大了一倍，比大戰前擴大了二點七倍。同時在歐洲别的國家中，這種面積却减少到一半以上（百分之六十）。在一九三二年，蘇聯的亞蔴產量佔全歡總產量百分之九十。</p>
<p>亞蔴塲面積之大量的增加，是由於蘇聯農業之社會的和經濟的變動而奠其基礎的。</p>
<p>至於荣蔴耕地的面積，現已增大到八十萬海克脫爾（Hectares，法國地積量名，）大戰前則僅有六十八萬海克脫爾。</p>
<p>在第一五年計畫剛開始的時候，亞麻和苧麻的主要生產者是個體農人（Ｉndividual　Peasants），那時（一九二八年）集體農塲的麻產量僅佔總產量千分之六。到一九三二年，集體農塲和國營農塲已成爲亞麻和苧麻的主要生產者，其出產量也已達到總產量百分之六十五以上了。</p>
<p>在亞麻和苧麻的種植上特别需要的是耕種機站。在一九三二年有二百六十一個這種專爲種植亞麻和苧麻而設的耕種機站。有七千五百九十三架耕種機在五十萬海克脫爾亞麻耕地上（佔歐洲其餘國家的一倍）和八萬海克脫爾苧麻耕地上活動着。</p>
<p>這許多耕種機站都是用最近代的農業機械裝配而成，這裏有訓練得最好的政治監察者，經營者和農村經濟的勢力丨丨這些都是使麻產大量增加的有力工具。</p>
<p>國營農塲和集體農塲（大半都在有耕種機站的區域内）現有一萬五千個受過良好訓練的打麻工人。</p>
<p>爲了增加亞麻產量的努力所得到的結果，不僅是亞麻耕地的面積擴大了，就是收成上也有顯著的增加，可送到市塲上去的麻產數目自然也更加增大了。</p>
<p>關於麻的採購的方法，現在和從前是完全不同的。在市塲交易價格不定的情形下，需要由國家規定在契約上予生產者（集體的或個體的都一樣）以借墊的例利，而由後者供給棉產於國家。在這些契約内，國家予生產者以生產上的必要補助，如供給他們以農業機器，礦質肥料，穀物，經過選擇的種子，以及信用上的和金錢上的墊欵等。同時麻業生產者從事耕種一定量面積的麻塲，視這種耕種所要求的農業技術上的消費情形，規定於一定期間内把那質地精美的收成之幾分之幾貢納於國家。</p>
<p>亞麻的這種借墊契約是一九二七年開始試行的，苧麻的則開始試行於一九二九年。在這期間耕地面積上僅是從百分之九到百分之十四試行這辦法。到一九三一年和一九三二年用這辦法耕種的面積已增到全麻塲百分之八十四以上了。</p>
<p>關於麻的採集，蘇聯政府是單獨特設了一個麻業部經管的。這裏常計畫怎樣增高產量和改良品質的事情。</p>
<p>第一五年計畫所賦予麻業生產者的課題，是要使麻的耕地面積大大的擴張，這一點恰好是有了如所願的發展。一九三三年計畫中所規定的二百三十萬海克脫爾的亞麻塲和八十六萬海克脫爾的苧麻塲是毫無困難的實現了的。亞麻的產量在一九三三年已增加了百分之二十，卽全產量一年中有五十五萬噸。</p>

<h3 id="c295">天眞的兒童　天國之最大使者 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 王約翰</p>
<p>兒童是偉大的，所以古今的哲人和詩人都崇拜兒童。</p>
<p>孟子說：『大人者不失赤子之心。』耶蘇說：『兒童是天國之最大使者。』老子說：『專致弱如嬰兒。』歌德更說：『我們應以他們（兒童）爲師。』大思想家馬克思亦常說：『我對於基督聖經最注意的地方，是其對於小孩的大友愛之情。』</p>
<p>兒童何以這樣値得崇拜呢？對於兒童的崇拜到底是出成人的一時高興呢？抑是成人眞的在兒童身上發現成人所没有的偉大呢？兒童的體力勝成人乎？智力勝成人乎？經騐思想勝成人乎？</p>
<p>我們要了解兒童的眞實偉大，是不能用常人的見解去衡量兒童的，我們須從兒童本身上去體會兒童的偉大。美國的兒童心理學家荷爾氏（Ｈall）說：『兒童時期是人類的天國，成人生活是從此而墮落。』這是一點都不錯的。我們成人所有的智慧，是不脫奴隸偏見的，我的所有的習慣和過去一切傳統都和夢魔一樣的壓迫着我們活人的腦子。成人自幼年而至於死，都不脫奴隸的覊軛，我們有什麽資格去評論兒童的人格呢？</p>
<p>兒童，他們何以是偉大的呢？就是因兒童有成人所没有的天眞爛漫吧。兒童要哭就哭，要笑就笑，他絶不關懷自我以外的勢力。兒童的天性，使兒童只求自我之發展和快樂之滿足。兒童是一個無畏忌的快樂的競逐者。兒童可以向成人求安慰，但他手上的東西是不能輕易給别人的，換句話說，兒童完全是爲自己而生存的自然人。兒童完全没有成人的偏見和道德觀念。這就是兒童的偉大。</p>
<p>人或反駁道：果如你所言，兒童只是一個自私自利的生物，有何偉大之可言，又有什麽値得崇拜呢？我的答覆是：是的；兒童正是一個自私自利的生物，但這正是兒童的偉大處。</p>
<p>所謂偉大是什麽呢？偉大就是指的造福人類的東西。兒童之所以偉大，就是因爲兒童是幸福的象徵。</p>
<p>每個人都是爲自己而生存的，每個人都有追求幸福的本能。而且在他追求幸福遇着障碍時，他本可毫無禁忌的與障碍以破壞。兒童之毁壞障碍他的物件，便是此種本能表現。所以有許多人說，假如兒童是有成人之力，他會是人間的巨兇。</p>
<p>但是我們成人都是從兒童之中來的。成人是怎樣失去兒童時代的天性呢？這是不能不歸之於人類的社會制度。人類在長期的生存競爭之中，使他了解到犧牲某些享樂慾求和發展是必要的，於是便自然而然的產生一種離開個人願望的社會制度。社會制度對於個人，恰像園林的主人對於花木，主人總是設法使花木失去自我的願望和發展，使之適合自己的所好。於是社會制度便剥奪人的絶對的存在，使人不復知有自己了。待至後來，社會不僅使其分子犧牲某種本能要求以滿足某種本能要求，且使某部分人犧牲本能要求以滿足另一部分人的無限要求。人類至此，誠如盧梭所云：</p>
<p>除出全體和公共生活之外，遂不知他有自己。』</p>
<p>但是人類的需要本能和求滿足的慾望是不會因抑壓而根絶的。人類恰如向上的𣏌柳，如硬使其曲折，一時固做得到，但其最初的天性是不會改變的，且在人工所不及時，仍舊是要向上發揚的。所以告子說：『以上性爲仁義，猶以𣏌柳爲桮棬。』人類如果不能完全失去求滿足求自由的本能，兒童更保存這些本能之樸素形態。所以兒童成爲幸福的人類的象徵，是天國的使者。兒童的天眞喚醒了奴隸的成人在文明之入口處失去了本能和欲求。所以身感爲奴隸的成人對兒童這種偉大的啓示才發生尊敬。</p>

<h3 id="c296">二本給孩子們讀的童話 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 金山</p>
<p>中國的孩子們所讀的童話，大半是什麽王子啦，公子啦，神仙啦，妖怪啦···一類的人物。這些童話，對孩子們的影響，除了使他們幻想他們自己也能像童話中主人翁所處的境遇外，要想找尋出一些以社會的，科學的智識灌輸給孩子們的，却是很困難的。但現在我所看到的幾本童話，雖然不是中國人所著，而是翻譯的，但牠是完成了上述的要求，而是適合於中國的孩子們的。所以我現在來做個簡單的介紹，也算是爲書店老板做個義務廣告。</p>
<p>第一本是美國新文學家哥爾特著的「卓别麟漫游記」。故事是一個小孩子，喬愛，亞丹底二個哥哥有一天到外邊去野餐去了，可是他自己因爲多吃了氷淇淋，病在牀上。他要求舉行一個賽會，但他的媽媽說這個房間太小，不能舉行，要他好好　覺，他就吵起來。可是他總敵不過瞬魔的勢力，慢慢就睡着了。接着小丑卓别麟就出現了。卓别麟非常熟心的爲喬愛去安排一個賽會；他帶喬愛到紐約市長那裏去要求賽會的許可書，但市長說這賽會是太麻煩他，不答應頒發。卓别麟就帶喬愛騎了匹象去找巨人傑姆丨丨他是非常和善的黑人，會吹「薩克索封」（一種美國樂器）。巨人傑姆親切地答應了喬愛的要求，就爬上了象，開始吹他的「薩克索封」。聽到他吹「薩克索封」的人都會跟了他跑，於是慢慢的形成了巨大的賽會。喬愛心裏非常快活。當他們到紐約的時候，市長和他的警察都已拿了棍棒，預備逮捕他們，爲的是擾亂秩序。卓别麟逃了，喬愛也逃了。市長就望喬愛追來，喬愛嚇得要哭了，就此醒來。</p>
<p>你瞧，這不是一本有趣味的童話嗎？</p>

<p>— 森然</p>
<p>我們知道，自文藝復興以來，隨着資本主義的發展，在科學上早已有了許多偉大的發明。别的且不要說，單是與無綫電有直接關係的發明，遠在馬可尼未聞名以前就有了許多，如電磁電報，發電機，電話，有綫電···都是在馬可尼未從事他的研究前就爲人發明了的。所有這些發明，所有自文藝復興以來的科學的文化的遺產，都是馬可尼發明無綫電的基礎。如果没有這個基礎，無論他怎樣聰明，怎樣有毅力，也是不會獲得那樣的成功的。你想，倘然馬可尼生在中世紀物黑暗時代，他能發明無綫電嗎？當然不能！丨丨此其一。</p>
<p>其次，馬可尼所處的時代正是資本主義發展到帝國主義的時代。在這個時代中，資本主義的經濟網已經籠罩了全世界。帝國主義國家正在努力競爭銷售商品的市塲，正在拚命爭奪殖民地，在此情形下，無論商業上，軍事上，政治上，都要求迅速地傳達消息。馬可尼的發明無綫電，便是在這一要求之下實現的。於此，我們可以說，當時英國的海軍演習，南阿戰爭與馬可尼的成功有很大的關係。</p>
<p>同時，馬可尼所生長的地方與他的發明也有不可分離的關係。我們知道，他是生在意大利，活動於英美的國度裏的。這些國家都是先進的國家，其文化程度都在一般之上，所謂近代文明便是以牠們爲代表的。馬可尼在這樣的社會環境中，才有發明無線電的可能。倘如他是生長在中國或印度，那就不會幹出那樣偉大的事業來了。</p>
<p>此外，馬可尼個人的生活環境也很重要。問題非常顯然，如果他不是生在富裕之家，受不到高等的教育，又，如果他得不到里契教授的指導，受不到黑爾支博士的實騐的暗示，遇不到普里士的帮助，那麽，我敢說，不管他是怎樣偉大的天才，他終於是要被埋没的；至於無綫電的發明，那便只有讓與他人了。</p>
<p>自然，馬可尼的聰明，毅力，我們不能否認。但這只是使他能成爲偉大發明家的可能的一個因素，令這種可能成爲現實的却是他所處的時代，社會和其個人的生活環境。</p>
<p>最後，我在評價了馬可尼之後，希望一般崇拜英雄，天才的人們不要迷信英雄，天才，應該科學地去理解他們。這樣，才不致走入神秘的道路！（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Far East Problem and the Naval Problem Are Inseparable. Japan Worries About Joint Action by Britain and the United States. Washington Places Importance on Political Discussions. The Content of the British Request Is Full of Compromising Tone. Japan Plans to Negotiate Separately with Britain and the United States. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, international observers predict that Britain and the United States will jointly resist Japan's proposed agenda for preliminary negotiations on next year's naval disarmament conference. It is said that Japan is now trying its best to talk with Britain and the United States separately, hoping to reach a preliminary understanding on the Far East political issues and naval issues. However, reliable sources today claimed that British and American diplomats all believe that political issues and naval ratio issues are inextricably linked. Japan's military actions in mainland Asia make it more difficult for them to negotiate separately. Britain and the United States believe that the commercial status of the two countries in the Far East, and the entire Pacific market, are all tied to this political negotiation. Today, the State Department stated that the United States has notified Britain that it is willing to join the preliminary negotiations of the naval conference. These preliminary negotiations will be held in London, but the date has not yet been decided, and the details have not been determined. What is known is that this meeting will be completely informal. Britain has also invited Japan, Italy, and France to participate. This meeting will not only be for representatives of the two countries to talk separately, but representatives of three or four countries will also meet simultaneously. The next negotiation will first determine the procedures for next year's conference, decide the date and location, and then discuss naval substantive issues and other matters. Today, Japanese sources in Washington claimed that since London has initiated this matter, they have no reason to discuss naval issues with the State Department. Some diplomats believe that Tokyo and Washington will soon send naval experts to London to assist the ambassadors of the two countries in the preparatory meeting. (National Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official personnel today, Foreign Minister Hirota will instruct Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain at the end of the week to express to the British government that the Japanese government is prepared to discuss the 1935 naval conference. It is expected that the discussions in London, in addition to the date, location, and procedures of the conference, will likely also involve important issues such as naval limitations. Although only Britain has inquired about the Japanese government's opinion, judging from the situation, the Japanese side is also willing to respond to the request to hold similar talks in Washington. The proposal to hold preliminary talks before the naval conference is generally welcomed, but local newspapers earnestly advise to pay attention to the talks between Britain and the United States, so as to avoid Britain and the United States reaching an agreement first, and then threatening Japan to accept it, as was done in 1930. This kind of argument seems to be a reflection of the official view. Although the Japanese newspaper said that Japan only wants to obtain equality in principle, so as to maintain sovereignty and national defense, it strongly advocates abolishing the ratio, saying that this ratio has various inconveniences, and being forced to build warships of all kinds that are not urgently needed is also one of them, and so on. (Reuters Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the discussions on holding a conference next year, all parties are keeping silent. The Foreign Office and the Admiralty are unwilling to express their opinions. It is believed that the degree of discussion is still only a preliminary inquiry. Before the start of the 1930 naval conference, there were preliminary talks, which were very helpful to the success of the conference, so it is now planned to make preliminary talks in advance. The events that will be discussed are probably the date and location of the 1935 conference, and the countries that should be invited to participate. It is heard that France and Italy have not yet responded to the British invitation to participate in the talks, but it is expected that these two countries will definitely be willing to participate.

<h3 id="e2">Japan's Reply to the British Request for Consultation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Begin Careful Discussions. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It was learned today that the Japanese government received a request from British Foreign Secretary Simon to exchange views on naval issues in advance in order to facilitate the naval conference. It is heard that the Japanese government plans to talk with Britain and the United States separately. (Reuters Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Foreign Secretary Simon proposed to convene a disarmament preparatory meeting, and the Japanese government expressed its agreement to this. However, Foreign Secretary Simon's proposal did not express anything about the date of the meeting and the agenda, so after this point is clarified, the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy will consult and issue a formal reply. However, because Foreign Minister Guangtian had stated in the Diet that he intends to conduct preliminary talks with various countries separately to discuss specific matters. (Rengo News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 25th from Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain, British Foreign Secretary Simon met with Ambassador Matsudaira on the 17th, advocating holding a preparatory meeting for naval disarmament in order to achieve the three fundamental goals of world peace, eliminating the threat of war, and reducing the burden on the people. Foreign Secretary Simon also briefly described the British naval system and the British views on general naval issues, and requested a reply from the Japanese government. Ambassador Matsudaira believed that this issue was very important and did not make a responsible statement, reserving his answer. (Rengo News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Simon's proposal for a three-nation preparatory meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs began careful discussions on the 26th, focusing on the talks of the British ambassador, with Foreign Minister Hirota inviting Deputy Foreign Minister Chongguang and others. It also intends to refer to the intentions of the naval authorities in order to determine its attitude. After Foreign Minister Hirota reports to the cabinet meeting, it will send a formal reply to Britain. It is heard that this meeting is not a meeting where Britain, the United States, and Japan gather together, but will be separate negotiations between Japan and the United States, Britain and Japan, and Britain and the United States. The form is roughly like this, but depending on the situation, it may be that the three countries will consult in one room. It is unknown. This meeting will most likely be realized between July and September. (Combined Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before next year's disarmament conference, the Japanese Navy has already made preparations early. Recently, British Foreign Secretary Simon notified the Japanese ambassador to Britain to hold a preparatory meeting, so the Navy also intends to have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convey its intention to participate in the preparation in reply recently. On the one hand, regarding the convocation of the formal disarmament conference, everything is also being prepared. (Rengo News, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British Charge d'Affaires in Japan, Mr. Dodd, visited Deputy Foreign Minister Chongguang around 1:00 PM on the 26th, proposing a naval preparatory meeting, the content of which was the same as that proposed by Foreign Secretary Simon to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, and inquired about the Japanese government's policy. Deputy Foreign Minister Chongguang briefly said that this matter is very good, but the situation is very important, and a reply can only be given after full consultation with the relevant parties. (Rengo News, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) If the preparatory meeting for the naval disarmament conference is convened, Britain will be represented by Foreign Secretary Simon, the United States will definitely be represented by its Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Bingham, and Mr. Davis, the plenipotentiary representative to the general disarmament conference in Geneva. Japan will be headed by Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain, with Counselor Kato of the embassy as its chief secretary. If the preparatory meeting progresses rapidly, the staff of the Japanese Embassy in Britain will feel insufficient. At that time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can send additional foreign secretaries to enrich its lineup. Foreign Minister Hirota has now started working on the candidates. As for the army and navy, it goes without saying that experts should be used as their advisors to participate. It is generally expected that Naval Attache Okano, a colonel stationed in London, and Lieutenant Colonel Masao Maruyama of the Army will be in charge. In addition, Major General Noboru Morita of the Army and Captain Risa Saburo Sato of the Navy, the Japanese representatives to the general disarmament conference in Geneva, must also be sent to London. Japan's lineup has been prepared here, and Foreign Minister Hirota will issue an order soon. (Rengo News, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The next disarmament conference will definitely be held due to the provisions of Article 23 of the London Treaty, but there are no provisions for the location, form, and agenda of the conference. Therefore, consultations must be conducted by various countries first, but which country is willing to serve as the host country, all countries are taking a cautious attitude and exploring the opinions of other countries. At this time, Britain suddenly proposed to convene a meeting. It is commendable that Britain, as the convening country of the London Conference, is enthusiastic about disarmament issues. Thus, the specific negotiations for the 1935 naval conference began the first step. In the future, the most noteworthy thing is how the negotiations between Britain, the United States, and Japan will proceed. (Rengo News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources in London, it is rumored that the preparatory negotiations for the 1935 naval conference will be held separately in Tokyo and London. Japan has conceded to the demand for equality in naval ratio in this negotiation. The Japanese Navy has recently issued a statement, saying that the Japanese Navy still demands the establishment of equality in armament rights. Japan's attitude is to enable all countries in the world to achieve disarmament and have an equal sense of security for their respective national defenses. This ambition has not changed in the slightest. (Dentsu News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Content of the British Request Discusses Substantive Naval Issues, Starting with Britain, the United States, and Japan. <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the preparatory work for the next naval conference, the proposal to convene a preparatory meeting between important naval countries was officially notified by Foreign Secretary Simon when British Foreign Secretary Simon met with the Japanese ambassador to Britain on the 17th. It is true. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has kept the content of Simon's proposal strictly confidential. It is now known that the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ The preparatory meeting hopes to discuss various substantive issues of the navy.</p>
<p>㈡ The preparatory meeting is limited to naval issues.</p>
<p>㈢ The preparatory meeting should be initiated by the diplomatic organs in London and negotiate with various countries individually in order to proceed.</p>
<p>㈣ The preparatory meeting should start with at least three countries, and initially the meeting should be opened by Britain, the United States, and Japan. There is no need for France and Italy to join at present.</p>
<p>Judging from the above content, the preparatory negotiations are not discussing issues such as the opening time and location of the next naval conference, but directly discussing the substance of naval disarmament issues. This preparatory meeting has increased its importance. On the British side, the restriction is limited to the calculation of naval issues. There is an intention that the so-called Pacific issue and the Far East issue are not included. As for whether the three countries will meet together and start discussing, it is doubtful, but regarding this point, the Japanese government has also hoped to conduct individual negotiations with various countries, and focus on the preparatory negotiations between Britain, the United States, and Japan. Regarding this proposal, which attracts attention, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will give a reply after careful discussions with the Ministry of the Navy. However, since the above points are the content of the proposal and do not violate the policy of the Japanese government, it should be happy to participate, so the naval conference may not have to wait until next year, but will actually open soon.

<h3 id="e4">American Congressman Criticizes Japanese Aggression, Japan's Ambition for Naval Equality, The United States Should Prevent It from Using Barbaric Tactics Again. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Congressman Britten told an Associated Press interviewer today that if Japan is allowed to increase its naval ratio, Manchuria, Hawaii, and the Philippines will undoubtedly be dominated by barbaric Japanese militarists. Congressman Britten is an important figure in the House Naval Affairs Committee and has long been known for his expertise in international naval issues. He said that if Japan insists on abolishing the existing naval ratio, the United States should immediately build defensive naval and air bases in the Pacific Islands. When the naval treaty is renegotiated next year, there is no reason for Japan to attempt to expand its ratio. Japan's occupation of tens of millions of square miles of Manchuria is not enough to make it necessary. The Chinese Navy is even more obviously not a threat. Therefore, the only conclusion is that Japan is seeking to control the Pacific with a world-dominating navy. If so, other countries in the Pacific must strictly guard against Japan and prevent it from repeating the same trick of occupying Manchuria. If Japan insists on its current naval policy, Manchuria is likely to become the meat on the chopping block of Japan's violent militarism. Therefore, we must establish a defense on that island. We should expand air bases in key locations in the Philippines, and the defense of Hawaii should also be strengthened to become a second Gibraltar. We should also demand that Japan's other islands be transferred to the management of the United States or other countries. Regarding the possibility of concluding a new naval treaty, Britten said that Japan's treaties with various countries in the past five years are no different from waste paper. Japan's slaughter of Chinese people and destruction of Chinese property is a blatant example of unprovoked aggression. (National Telegraph, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Abolition of Extortionate Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies Should Not Be Delayed Any Longer. <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Today, there are many who suffer from the evils of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies. They say that since the tide of the world's economic panic invaded, our country's economic situation has become more and more difficult. Even the relatively developed yarn industry has failed to compete with foreign imports in the market. Other industries need not be mentioned. Not only does it encounter obstacles everywhere in exporting overseas, but it is also hindered by extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies even if it wants to barely survive in the domestic market. This is the first reason why the abolition of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture, but recently, due to low grain prices, farmers cannot even feed themselves with their entire harvest, so they have left the countryside in droves, resulting in a panic of land abandonment. Although this kind of dangerous situation can be partially explained by natural disasters and other political reasons, the elements that constitute the separation between the government and the public and the decline of the countryside should be the first to be extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies. If this kind of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies are not fundamentally eliminated, not only is there no hope for the revival of the rural economy, but even maintaining the status quo of a comfortable life is difficult. This is the second reason why the abolition of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Even in terms of the government's revenue and expenditure relationship, the main sources of finance for the central government are tariffs and salt taxes. Initially, they had nothing to do with extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies, but the consolidated tax and stamp duty income were inevitably indirectly affected by the heavy burden of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies. As for local governments, some think that relying on extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies can make up for the inadequacy of regular taxes. In fact, most of what is generally called extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies is pocketed by tax officials, while the amount actually received by local governments is a minority. In this case, extra-legal taxation only invites resentment from the people and does not provide much assistance to the government. This is the third reason why the abolition of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>The evils of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies are like this. Fortunately, this year's financial conference explained the nature of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies and has decided on six areas, and plans to abolish them in stages from July 1st of this year to the end of December. However, we still have something to say. At the same time, the conference also decided that the compensation method after the abolition of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies can be discussed separately, and those provinces and cities with special circumstances that cannot comply with the deadline to abolish them completely can also submit a special report to the ministry. Given the common problem of our country's conferences in the past, which is that resolutions cannot be implemented and eventually become pending cases and then end, the resolution of the above-mentioned financial conference has two provisos attached. One is related to the compensation method, and the other is related to the special circumstances of each province and city. I am afraid that the abuses will inevitably follow the same path as the various proposals in the past. The abolition of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies can be delayed by each province and city on the grounds that the compensation funding is insufficient, and can also shirk responsibility by using special local circumstances as an excuse. As a result, the deadline at the end of this year may be extended indefinitely. It must be known that our country has a vast territory and transportation is obstructed. Any place or any province or city has its special circumstances. If remote provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Xikang, and Qinghai are considered, their special points are too numerous to mention, and the heavy burden of extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies is rare in the world. If the government does not strictly implement the policy of real rectification, those who outwardly obey but inwardly oppose will inevitably be many. Our people are without livelihood.</p>
<p>At present, the financial situation of each province and city is indeed in a situation where it is difficult to continue to exploit the land. However, this kind of phenomenon is actually a reflection of the national economy being on the verge of bankruptcy. If we do not engage in fundamental cultivation to give people a chance to breathe and regenerate, I am afraid that once the national economy collapses, local income will also perish together. Confucius Caiyun said, "The people's burden is already deep, and even if you want to collect extortionate taxes again, they cannot bear it. The foundation of the country lies in the people. How can you bear to make endless additions?" It can be seen that the authorities are well aware of the people's suffering. No matter what special circumstances the locality has, it must eliminate all difficulties in order to relieve the people from their plight.</p>
<p>We believe that if we want to abolish extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies, we should actively strive to eliminate the source of the abuses, and not worry about passively compensating for the shortfall. In the past, the reason why extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies were difficult to abolish was mostly because there were too many redundant troops in various places, and the government's supply was insufficient. The discipline of the army was lax, which led to turning around and disturbing the people. Therefore, the fundamental solution is that first, the central government should strictly order each province and region not to form extra troops. Those who are active soldiers and concurrently serve as provincial chairmen must not expand their teams privately. The second is to carefully plan a troop reduction plan. Those who have been reduced should be demobilized separately, and those who have not been reduced should be given regular pay so that the central command can be implemented, and the day when extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies are abolished will eventually come. If we do not do this and only talk about compensation, I am afraid that it will not help in practice.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 8:00 PM on the 25th, a team of Japanese infantry stationed in Luan County practiced resisting war. Suddenly, gunshots rang out. The defense corps stationed in the county did not know the truth and sent team members to patrol. Three of them mistakenly entered the Japanese military's own cordon. They were arrested and accused of anti-Japanese behavior. They were imprisoned and wantonly tortured in the Japanese barracks, and protested to Tao Shangming, the administrative commissioner of Luan and Yu County.

<h3 id="e9">Yesterday's Financial Conference Held Large Meetings in the Morning and Afternoon; Opinions on the Business Tax Plan Sent to the Executive Yuan for Reference; Measures to Abolish Exorbitant Taxes and Levies Passed; Two Savings Societies Prevented from Recruiting Members; Opium Tax Abolished and Limited Time for Complete Eradication; Fourth General Meeting <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The fourth general meeting of the Financial Conference was held at 10:30 AM on the 26th. 134 members were present and 7 were excused. Kong Xiangxi chaired the meeting and reported the receipt of four official documents, including a comparative table of the additional levies on land taxes in various counties submitted by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Finance, and a report on the reduction of additional land taxes submitted by the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Finance. The discussion began immediately, with Zhang Shuyong, the director of the Second Group, reporting on the review process of various business tax proposals. The secretary then read out the review opinions and results.</p>
<p>The whole case was of great importance. Wang Chengying and Yang Mianzhong advocated expanding the business tax rate, opposing the review opinions, because Zhejiang Province was undergoing construction, and the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies must be compensated by business tax. Ma Yinchu said that Zhejiang's construction needed other compensatory measures, and strongly denounced the harm of prize-linked savings by the International Savings Society and the Sino-French Savings Society, saying that the financial authorities should not allow them to continue or should find ways to recover the funds. The International Savings Society has already collected 60 million yuan, and if it continues, it will have a great impact on the national economy. Wang Hantao advocated that the business tax rate should be flexible to suit local conditions, allowing for expansion and contraction, and to protect domestic goods and prevent the intrusion of foreign goods. The case should be referred to another committee for detailed review.</p>
<p>Guan Jiyu said that protecting domestic goods should be approached in other ways. He also said that the business tax in various countries uses the turnover as a standard. This kind of transaction tax is equivalent to China's likin, an important tax levy, which is very harmful to the people and violates the fundamental concept of business tax. The collection of business tax should classify industries and grade taxes, making it very simple, because the purpose of collecting this tax is not to raise the tax rate, but to collect it universally, in order to achieve good results. Chen Changheng said that the tax rate should not be increased, and the review results should be added with the words "It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance submit all the original proposals and review opinions to the Executive Yuan, which will then be transferred to the Legislative Yuan for reference when amending the Business Tax Law." Wei Tingsheng argued that in an economic downturn, he did not agree to increase the tax rate, and that the original review proposal should be passed. Zhang Kailian said that the business tax should be moderately increased to 20 per mille. Wu Jiantao advocated that all cases should be handed over to the Ministry of Finance for detailed consideration and handling based on the actual situation in various places.</p>
<p>The chairman said that the provisions of the business tax rate should be flexible, and that if the provinces have opinions, the Ministry can allow them to handle them within a possible range. Reducing exorbitant taxes and levies requires seeking compensatory methods. At present, agricultural products are not valuable, farmers cannot afford the burden, and everyone is trying to restore the rural areas, so taxes should not be increased. The commercial situation is also the same. As long as businessmen can afford it, it is okay to collect more taxes, but the situation varies from place to place, and the local financial authorities should consult with the Ministry of Finance based on the actual situation. Secondly, China cannot determine expenditures based on income, but should use the principle of determining income based on expenditures, saving where possible.</p>
<p>Then Xu Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, spoke and responded to Ma Yinchu's points, saying that the Ministry of Finance would never allow prize-linked savings to profit from taxation. The two savings societies, the Sino-French and the International, were permitted during the Beijing era and could be resolved through legislative procedures and administrative methods. At this point in the discussion, members believed that the business tax matter could not be resolved in a short period of time, and expressed their agreement to Chen Changheng's amendment. The Zhejiang representatives were dissatisfied with the review opinions and declared their withdrawal of the original proposal. The chairman said that this was not possible. As a result, the case was amended and passed based on Chen Changheng's proposal. The original text was to submit all the original proposals and review opinions to the Executive Yuan, which would then be transferred to the Legislative Yuan for reference when amending the Business Tax Law. If there are any articles of the Business Tax Law that cannot be met, the Ministry of Finance should submit them to the Executive Yuan, which will then request the Legislative Yuan to amend and promulgate them according to law for implementation.</p>
<p>Then, the original proposal of the Ministry of Industry to organize the business tax of various provinces and cities to conform to the original intention of benefiting merchants and enriching taxes was discussed. Regarding the Shanghai Special Zone road deed stamp duty case, and the case regarding the review of the application of stamp duty on bills of lading for foreign shipping companies, the above three cases were all passed according to the review results. After the Second Group's review report proposals were discussed, Ma Yinchu reported on the review process of various cases by the Third Group. Regarding item A of the fourth part of the Minister's discussion on organizing local finances, the resolution on the division of provincial and municipal local revenue and expenditure was passed according to the review opinion, according to the principles of the first case of this group. Regarding the first two items in the draft regulations for determining local budgets proposed by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the cases of the Hubei, Anhui, and Shandong Departments of Finance, the resolution was passed according to the review results. The central and local budgets at all levels should be compiled and sent within the legal time limit and strictly implemented. Regarding the internal proposal to determine the procedures for reviewing local administrative expenses, the resolution was passed after modification according to the review results.</p>
<p>Finally, the various cases reviewed by the Fourth Group were discussed. The Hunan Provincial Government requested the Central Government to issue a clear order that the national tax agencies should still entrust the provincial local governments to supervise them in the vicinity in order to rectify the case. Zhang Kailian listed various facts in Hunan Province to oppose the review results. Wei Tingsheng said that the central government will set up accounting sub-offices and other audit agencies in various places, and there is no need for local supervision. As a result, according to the review opinion, the national tax agencies have no subordinate relationship with the provincial local governments, and the proposal in this case is prone to confusion with the administrative system and is difficult to establish. Regarding the proposal to request the central government to allocate funds to develop Guizhou's coal and iron ore resources, the proposal that central and local finances should be internally and externally interconnected to achieve balanced development, the proposal that provincial universities should be changed to national universities or subsidized by the central government to improve them, the request that the government order local officials in various provinces to assist in handling the salt affairs reward and punishment regulations, and the request to reduce the autonomous expenses of various counties and reduce the people's burden, the above cases were all passed according to the review results. Finally, Ma Yinchu and other ten people jointly made a temporary motion regarding the ban on prize-linked savings, requesting to prevent the International and Sino-French Savings Societies from recruiting new members, and requesting the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to supervise the funds of these societies. After Kong Xiangxi appointed other members to review them, they were submitted to the general meeting for discussion and the meeting adjourned at 12:30 noon. The fifth general meeting continued at 2:00 PM to discuss the unfinished proposals. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>D. The review opinion on cracking down on private minting of silver and copper coins and private issuance of banknotes to clean up the currency policy: China's currency system urgently needs to be unified and organized. The Ministry of Finance has long stipulated various organization plans. The claim in this case is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance and is very practical and feasible. It should be considered established. It is proposed that the Ministry should notify the provinces based on the original laws and orders to effectively crack down. All mint bureaus in various provinces are ordered to stop minting from today. If there are difficulties in remote provinces, they should also truthfully explain them and the parts should be organized separately. Passed according to the review opinion.</p>

Please consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find ways to recover the privilege of foreign banks to issue banknotes as soon as possible to lay the foundation for a unified currency policy.

Passed according to the review opinion.</p>

Arbitrary allocation is more painful for the people than exorbitant taxes and levies. The Shandong Department of Finance's proposal to strictly prohibit counties from arbitrarily allocating after the budget is announced should be strictly prohibited in accordance with financial principles. Please ask the Ministry of Finance to submit it to the Executive Yuan to notify the provinces to strictly prohibit the arbitrary allocation of counties. Once verified, they will be severely punished to alleviate the people's difficulties. Resolution: Passed according to the review opinion.</p>

(2) Zhejiang Provincial Government Finance Department proposed to re-divide the standards for national and local revenue. Review opinion: The first and sixth points of the first case have been seen in the third review report of this group, and the seventh point has been seen in the second report of this group, all of which have been passed by the General Assembly. The second, third, and fifth points seem to be appropriate for the sake of regulating central and local finances. The percentage of the inheritance tax and income tax distribution should be determined by the central government. The fourth point should be strictly enforced for the sake of clearing up the scourge. The eighth point, the expenses of the national universities in various provinces and cities, are originally borne by the central government. The part paid by various provinces and cities is also the nature of assisting the central government. Article 2, regarding the re-division of national and local revenue and expenditure matters, the conference has already made a concrete resolution. Change the fourth point to that local opium tax and donation should be abolished uniformly, and opium poisoning should be completely banned within a limited time.

Provinces and counties that have already divided the tax revenue should strictly abide by the rules, and provinces and counties that have not divided it should divide it quickly to assign responsibilities. Resolution: Passed after modification according to the review opinion. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Item C of the cases passed by the Financial Conference on the 26th is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the various business tax cases, after the chairman Zhang Shuyong reported, Wang Zhengying believed that the report was unfair in terms of collection methods and tax rate classification. The biggest thing was that the banking industry was not taxed, while the money shop industry was taxed. Xu Kan replied that the banking industry had another income tax and was not exempt from taxation. After a long discussion on the case, Chen Changheng proposed that the Ministry of Finance should submit the original proposals and review opinions of various provinces to the Executive Yuan, and specially request the Legislative Yuan to use them as a reference for amending the Business Tax Law, which was immediately passed (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Member Wang Hantao of the Financial Conference proposed to restore the old system of salt administration agencies and abolish the method of auditors concurrently managing administrative affairs to clarify the system. Review results: Wei Tingsheng believed that increasing administrative expenses was inconsistent with the purpose of convening the financial meeting and was immediately rejected. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At this National Financial Conference, all border provinces sent representatives. However, the Guangxi Provincial Government telegraphed the Ministry of Finance that the original representative was currently unable to attend the meeting due to matters of state. Then Kong Xiangxi, the chairman of the conference, telegraphed Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the province, to request that another representative be sent to Beijing to report to the secretariat of the conference and attend the fourth general meeting on the morning of the 26th. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Opium Banned Within a Limited Time <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In the afternoon of the 26th, the Financial Conference discussed the proposal of Chen Changheng et al. to reduce local land tax surcharges and abolish exorbitant taxes and levies in order to maintain the balance of local budget revenue and expenditure, and that the central government should coordinate the subsidy of local finances. The original proposal outlined four points, saying that the period of political tutelage was coming to an end, but most of the work during the military administration period has not been completed, and the harm of opium has increased, which is not unrelated to the separate collection of evil taxes by the central and local governments. If the financial meeting is to save the country and the people, as the chairman said, to be a meeting to save the country, it should make the greatest determination and perseverance to unanimously and solemnly resolve to abolish all opium evil taxes levied by the central and local governments, which are addictive, thirst-quenching, country-weakening, species-related, and have no legal basis. It is also recommended that the central government issue a clear order to completely ban the opium poison in the country within three years. The review committee also believed that the method of clearing up the scourge should be strictly implemented. During the discussion, members Ma Yinchu, Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, and Li Quanshi all spoke, all of whom believed that the harm of opium was to weaken the country and destroy the people. They hoped that the central government and Minister Kong could change the way to plan, no matter what the facts and rumors were, they should thoroughly clear them up, so as to conform to the purpose of the meeting to save the country and survive. As a result, the fourth point was revised to abolish all opium taxes in various places, and opium poisoning should be completely banned within three years. The vote was passed. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Measures to Ban Savings Societies <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the general meeting of the Financial Conference on the afternoon of the 26th, Ma Yinchu, Jia Shiyi, Wei Tingsheng, Tang Qiyu, Wang Hantao, Zhang Wei, Deng Junfang, and other ten people temporarily proposed two measures to ban the Sino-French International Savings Society: (1) Stop collecting new membership fees, (2) The Ministry of Finance sends personnel to supervise the society's funds. After the General Assembly decided, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Also, the Xiamen Shipping Association sent a telegram requesting the abolition of the shipping tax. The General Assembly decided to abolish the tax by sending a telegram from the General Assembly, believing that the ship tax was one of the exorbitant taxes. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu et al. proposed to the Financial Conference to strictly prohibit the International Sino-French prize-linked savings case. Review opinion: Please submit it to the Ministry of Finance for verification. The General Assembly has voted to pass it this afternoon. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Kong Gives Financial Meeting Members Folding Fans <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister Kong gave each member of the Financial Conference a folding fan on the 26th, on which was written that finance is the lifeblood of the country, and now our country is suffering from anemia and poisonous blood. I hope that the national doctors who came to this meeting to do the work of replenishing and purifying blood will implement the plan one by one, and the country will be saved. Also, Kong invited all members to tour the Five Continents Park and hold a picnic at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Ping-Sui Railway Begins to Organize Debts; East Asia Debts Are Also a Part; Completely Unrelated to Nishihara Loans <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Millers Review said that the Ping-Sui Railway's organization of the Japanese East Asia Xingye Company's loan was the prelude to the Chinese government's organization of the Nishihara loans. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Railways, the Japanese newspaper reported on May 6 that an agreement to organize the Ping-Sui Railway's 5.2 million yen loan with the Japanese East Asia Xingye Company was signed on April 25. This was true. It was negotiated by the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau and East Asia and approved by the Ministry. In the past two years, the Ministry has actively organized road debts, first to improve creditworthiness and second to determine the pre-determined non-projects of each road. Since its implementation, the creditworthiness of the railway has greatly improved and is well known at home and abroad. The Ping-Sui has gradually gained confidence in business since last year. In order to reduce the burden and be considerate of the creditors, it has long established a method for organizing debts and has signed organization methods with 40 to 50 creditors. East Asia is one of the creditors and requested organization based on the case. The negotiation with the Railway Bureau is within the scope of the pre-scheduled plan. As for the negotiation conditions, both the Railway Bureau and the creditors benefit. The Ping-Sui's organization of East Asia's debts is part of the Ping-Sui's method of organizing debts, and it is also part of the Ministry of Railways' policy of organizing debts. It is purely a railway affair and is completely unrelated to the Nishihara loans. The Millers Report mistakenly believed that Chen Youren listed the Ping-Sui East Asia loan as part of the Nishihara loans in his article published in 1918, and then published a speech based on this wrong record, which is contrary to the facts. There is no Ping-Sui East Asia loan in the Nishihara loans. The Nishihara loans included seven items of loans and advances: (1) Bank of Communications loan, (2) Wired Telegraph loan, (3) Jihui Railway advance, (4) Jihei Forest and Mine loan, (5) Manchuria and Mongolia Four Roads advance, (6) Gao Xu Ji Shun advance, (7) War Participation loan, all of which have their own history. I don't know why Chen Youren mistakenly listed the Ping-Sui Road East Asia loan in it, and Millers misunderstood it. (Special telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Statement by Administrative Authorities on the Issue of Traffic and Postal Service. The Japanese Side Has Indeed Proposed a Solution, but Our Government Has Not Yet Discussed It <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the various issues of traffic and postal service, there has been much noise recently, and newspapers in Shanghai and Ping (Beiping) have published conflicting reports and various rumors, making it difficult for the public to know the truth. A reporter from the Central News Agency, considering the importance of this matter, specially visited the administrative authorities at their official residence on the morning of the 26th to inquire about the true situation. According to the authorities, regarding the postal issue, only the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations recently resolved on a method for mail from various countries to pass through Manchuria. This matter is merely a technical method for administrative organs to maintain postal services and is by no means a relationship between governments. However, our country has not yet discussed this matter with Japan, and the reports in various newspapers are not factual. As for the traffic issue, the Japanese side has indeed recently proposed a study to our responsible officials, but it is not a formal negotiation. Moreover, this is only the Japanese side's individual opinion, and our government has not yet discussed it, nor has it made any concrete decisions. The various rumors circulating are all inaccurate. Even if the two sides reach a result through future research, it must first be submitted to the central government for overall consideration before it can be finalized. In short, the central government has always adhered to the principle of not violating and not recognizing the puppet organization on this matter; otherwise, there is absolutely no room for consideration. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of postal service in the Northeast, relevant parties have begun to comply with the resolution of the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee of the League of Nations: "The exchange of mail between member states of the Universal Postal Union and the Northeast is considered a technical issue, not a relationship between countries, and certainly not recognition of the puppet organization." Based on this principle, ordinary postal relations will be restored at an appropriate time, without any connection to the three words "puppet organization." The Ministry of Communications is conducting careful research based on the League of Nations resolution. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) At 4 p.m. on the 25th, 200 anti-Japanese volunteers under the command of Western Province suddenly attacked between Yimianpo and Jiujiangbao. Although the Jilin army fought back, they were outnumbered and three soldiers were killed, and fifteen were kidnapped by the volunteers. (Electrified dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Since the anti-Japanese volunteers in Antu County killed the puppet county magistrate, Japanese advisor, and Japanese police instructor a few days ago, many puppet soldiers and police have defected and joined the volunteers. The Japanese army immediately sent a large contingent to garrison Antu County. The volunteers then used the Dajianggang and Dashahe areas north of Antu County as their base. On the 24th, they destroyed the military telephone line in Dashahe and are poised to attack the county town. The Japanese army in the city is trembling with fear, and the Kwantung Army has ordered other Japanese troops stationed in Dunhua to provide reinforcements. (Hualian dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 18th of this month, the Japanese army stationed in Hengdaohezi, led by Second Lieutenant Fukuyama, sent a detachment out of the city to attack the volunteers, but their whereabouts were unknown. The Japanese army then dispatched a team again on the afternoon of the 23rd to search. It was discovered that Fukuyama's team had been in fierce battles with the volunteers for several days northwest of the city. Second Lieutenant Fukuyama and Private First Class Kami-Kobe had been killed, and Private First Class Ueda was seriously wounded. The remaining team was lost and unable to return to their base.

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Army Ministry, at 2 p.m. yesterday, two Japanese people, Takeda and Konmatsu, discovered a strange plane on the border between northern Sakhalin and Russian Sakhalin. The plane was a biplane and emitted black smoke during flight. The two Japanese people believed it was a Soviet Russian plane and reported it to the Japanese police, who then reported it to the Sakhalin Agency. The Army Ministry is investigating the truth about the plane. (Hualian dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e19">Amidst the Rumblings of Cabinet Instability in Japan, Kiyoura Arrives in Tokyo to Operate; the Ugaki Cabinet Theory is Also Quite Strong <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Count Kiyoura Keigo, who was nominated as a strong candidate for the successor cabinet, returned to Tokyo from Kyoto, the central political situation has suddenly become active. It has been decided that Governor-General Ugaki is the first choice for the head of the next cabinet, and Count Kiyoura is the second. It is rumored that the military's opposition to Ugaki has not subsided recently, so the Kiyoura theory is now very strong. In the House of Peers, a clandestine movement to support Count Kiyoura, centered on Otsuka Koremasa and Nagaoka Ryuichiro, etc., is underway. It is generally believed that after Saito, it will be difficult to form a political party cabinet and impossible to return to constitutional normalcy. Therefore, it is deemed appropriate for the senior statesman Count Kiyoura to form the successor cabinet. Although Count Kiyoura is 85 years old, he is in excellent spirits and his healthy state is also capable of handling the complexities of the prime ministership. (Den-tsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Following rumors of the Saito cabinet's resignation, Governor-General Ugaki of Korea, who is expected to continue to organize the Second Emergency Cabinet, received a telegram from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs stating that Governor-General Ugaki is scheduled to depart from Seoul on the 28th for Tokyo. He will inspect southern Korea en route, and is expected to arrive in Tokyo at 4:55 p.m. on the 31st. Although a portion of the military opposes Governor-General Ugaki's assumption of the next cabinet, it is still quite promising. Therefore, all parties are paying special attention to Governor-General Ugaki's arrival in Tokyo this time. (Den-tsu dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Foreign Minister Barthou Declares France Is Not Isolated; Liaison with Allied Nations is Underway; The Door to Disarmament Is Not Yet Closed; However, French Policy Remains Unchanged <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies held a meeting today to discuss foreign affairs. Many people from the diplomatic community and foreign journalists attended to listen. Foreign Minister Barthou attended and delivered a declaration, which was warmly welcomed throughout the venue. Barthou first referred to Austria as a pillar of peace in Central Europe, and France's policy has always been to maintain its independence. As for Poland, it is a friendly and allied country of France, and his recent trip to Warsaw has brought the Soviet Union and Poland closer. Barthou also said that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is a major event. Barthou, as a lover of peace, believes that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is of great benefit to peace. Barthou recounted his meeting with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov in Geneva, saying that he had discussed the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations with Litvinov. However, regarding the Soviet Union's request to become a permanent member of the Council of the League of Nations, it seems too early to comment on what attitude France will take. Barthou went on to describe his visits to Czechoslovakia and Poland, saying that the people of both countries warmly received him and the friendship was unforgettable. His trip to Warsaw consolidated the alliance treaty between France and Poland in 1921. He will soon go to Romania and Yugoslavia, and any differences between them can be eliminated through this. He will meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Rüşdü on Saturday. It can be seen that France's policy is to connect the emotions of all parties.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of disarmament, Barthou said that the policies pursued by previous cabinets are still being followed, that is, disarmament is carried out under conditions of security and in pursuit of equality of armaments. However, France cannot ignore military groups outside the official German army, and as long as Germany's rearmament action does not stop for a day, France will not recognize disarmament for a day. In its reply to Britain on April 17 of this year, France stated that it has always believed that the Disarmament Conference should take disarmament as its final result, and that rearmament contrary to the peace treaty should not be recognized by the Disarmament Conference. However, in any case, the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference are not closed, and the French government has always supported peace and has always been loyal to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Regarding the Saar region's vote next year, Barthou said that the freedom of voters must be absolutely respected. During the discussion in Geneva this time, any method that would make Saar residents vulnerable to retaliation after voting was firmly rejected. France has not abandoned the rights it obtained from the treaty regarding the Saar issue, which is deeply gratifying. Barthou said that he had stated to Aloisi, chairman of the Special Committee on the Saar issue, in Geneva that effective safeguards must be taken for the Saar residents' vote. Germany's empty promises to guarantee the freedom of voting are insufficient even if they are a formal declaration. At that time, Aloisi and the Special Committee formulated a method that they considered acceptable, namely, "The French and German governments are willing to recognize all measures that the League of Nations can take to protect the Saar residents." However, the German government was unwilling to accept this method, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Barthou concluded by saying that no one in the French people likes to fight. The French are doing their best to avoid war, and he believes that war can be avoided. The French will always be consistent with their friendly and allied countries. It is not impossible for France and Italy to reach a friendly compromise, and its relationship with Britain has not cooled. At this time, someone raised questions about France's international relations. Barthou replied that France is not in an isolated position. At this point, almost all the members of the venue applauded, including the Socialist Party. The Chamber of Deputies then decided to postpone the question on foreign affairs until the Foreign Minister returns from Geneva, as the Foreign Minister must go to Geneva in the near future, and then adjourned the meeting.

<p>(Paris) Turkish Foreign Minister Rüşdü visited Foreign Minister Barthou this morning and had a meeting lasting one hour. The conversation involved the Balkan Pact, and there was also mention of the possibility of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations. It is generally known that Turkey and the Soviet Union have a very close relationship, so the conversation between the foreign ministers of France and Turkey this time cannot be taken lightly. Generally speaking, in the coming weeks, the issue of the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations will be the main issue in international talks in Geneva and consultations between governments, as the various difficulties of the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations have not yet been resolved.

<p>(Geneva) Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, arrived here this morning. While talking to people in the Disarmament Conference lounge today, Henderson declared that he does not intend to make any new proposals at this session of the conference. In his opinion, only the countries attending the Disarmament Conference, especially those most concerned with the disarmament issue, can clearly state their intentions at this session and make new proposals when necessary. It is rumored that Henderson supports returning the entire file of the disarmament issue to the Council of the League of Nations as an end. Regarding this rumor, Henderson again denied it today. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Although Britain and France are only separated by a strip of water, their concepts of security are very different. Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, after returning to England from Paris, recently spoke to a special correspondent of a newspaper about two different opinions on the Disarmament Conference. First, in Henderson's view, the best way to get Germany back to Geneva is to have the entire General Committee of the Disarmament Conference reiterate the declaration of December 11, 1932, in which the five major powers allowed Germany to obtain the right to equality of armaments within the scope of security. Second, Henderson is most opposed to transferring the negotiations on the disarmament issue to the Council of the League of Nations. He said, "I don't see any benefit in such a method. It is undoubtedly impossible for Germany to attend the Council of the League of Nations. As far as the interests of small countries are concerned, their representatives on the Main Committee on Disarmament are more numerous than those on the Council of the League of Nations. As for the major powers, their opinions are divided, and therefore all progress has been hindered so far. In the future, it is difficult to expect them to be more harmonious and courageous on the Council of the League of Nations than in normal disarmament negotiations. Moreover, in case of failure, public opinion will blame the League of Nations itself, rather than the politicians representing the countries." According to the five-power declaration of December 11, 1932, the principle to be followed by the Disarmament Conference is to give Germany and other countries that have been reduced in armaments by treaty, in principle, the right to equality of armaments within a security system suitable for all countries. Germany then returned to the Disarmament Conference. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference will meet in Geneva on the 29th of this month. The United States will still send Davis to attend as an observer. Davis arrived here in the industry today from the United States. Also, Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, arrived here from London. Henderson and Davis went to Geneva together in the same car tonight. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>The Foreign Minister of the capital of Yugoslavia, Yeftich, set off today for Geneva to attend the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference. It is expected that Yeftich will then go directly to Paris and formally invite the French government between June 10 and 11. Yeftich will also jointly study the situation created by the recent coup in Bulgaria with Maksimos, Titu, and Rüşdü, the foreign ministers of the other signatory countries of the Balkan Entente, Greece, Romania, and Turkey, and will try to persuade Bulgaria to join the Balkan Entente. In addition, after arriving in Geneva, Yeftich will meet with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, and with the consent of Titu and Enules, he will continue the negotiations to restore diplomatic relations between the Little Entente and the Soviet Union. These negotiations were started by Litvinov and Titu in France. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Close Cooperation with Soviet Russia to Maintain Peace, But It Is Too Early to Give It a Permanent Seat on the Council of the League of Nations</p>

<p>(Paris) During the Chamber of Deputies' discussion of foreign affairs today, Socialist Deputy Chassel asked about the Soviet Union and Poland. Foreign Minister Barthou replied, "Do you want to know the government's thoughts on the Soviet Union joining the League? Your question is not difficult for me. I see the Soviet Union joining the League as a major event, and I am a lover of peace, so I see the Soviet Union joining the League as being of great importance to peace. My words and actions in Warsaw have been directed towards this, as has been the case in Geneva. Besides that, what else do you want to ask me? However, there is one question that seems less cautious to speak of at this time, that is, if the Soviet Union requests to be a permanent member of the Council of the League of Nations, what attitude will France take? What is considered incautious is that it is too early to speak of it at this time, and Poland has priority in this regard. You often know that the Council of the League of Nations has had a proposal to give a permanent seat to Poland, and the person who advocated this at the time was the former Foreign Minister Briand. What you want to know must be what attitude the French representative will take to resolve this issue when the General Assembly of the League of Nations meets in three months. Do you think that if both the Soviet Union and Poland request permanent seats, we will have no way to reconcile them? I respectfully inform you that when I met with Litvinov in Geneva, I was considering the conditions for the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

The agreement was negotiated by General Gamlin and his staff from the French side and Russian chargé d'affaires Roseno. It stipulates that the two countries exchange military officers and military strategies. It is formal and avoids direct mutual assistance clauses as much as possible to avoid arousing suspicion. This is also where it differs slightly from a formal military alliance. However, General Gamlin will soon go to Moscow to fully decide how to expand its scope. (National dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Budapest) According to news from the Romanian capital, hundreds of Romanian military officers wrote to General Averescu, saying that the promotion of some officers was arbitrary, the morale of the army was dissatisfied, the king expressed sympathy for the attitude of the military, and the people also demanded clarification of the political situation. The current government, therefore, intends to retire. General Averescu has forwarded the officers' petition to the king. It is heard that General Averescu, the leader of the Liberal Party split faction, Bratianu, and the leader of the political party, Argetoianu, are negotiating to prepare to form a new government, and some people think that the new cabinet will have the trend of an authoritarian government.

<p>(Geneva) The representative of the Republic of Paraguay to the League of Nations, Bedoya, has recently notified the Council of the League of Nations that Bolivia does not abide by the international law rules commonly followed by civilized countries.

Although Paraguay has repeatedly negotiated diplomatically, hoping that Bolivia would abandon this barbaric means, it has been ineffective. Therefore, Paraguay's decision is indeed legitimate. The Paraguayan government, although unwilling to use this barbaric method, has no choice but to use the same method to treat Bolivia. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Bulgaria Becomes a Hotbed for Global Narcotics Manufacturing: Inflow of Raw Materials Has Increased Greatly in Recent Years, with a Large-Scale Transportation Organization; U.S. Representative Addresses League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, U.S. Representative Fuller, at a meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee, revealed the inside story of Bulgaria's opium and narcotics trafficking. Fuller cited the words of Cairo Police Chief Russell, stating that Bulgaria remains a major source of narcotics manufacturing in Europe, thus attracting villains from all over the world. In 1930, Bulgaria imported only a small amount of materials for manufacturing narcotics. However, by 1933, the amount imported was sufficient to manufacture twelve times the amount of narcotics needed for legitimate purposes worldwide. Bulgaria currently has the world's most well-organized smuggling organization, and a former Sofia police chief is the owner of a narcotics factory, while another Minister of Health is also involved in this business. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee met today, chaired by Austrian Representative Souersitz. U.S. Representative Fuller reported on various narcotics figures to prove that the amount of anhydrous acetic acid manufactured in France and Germany and imported into Bulgaria has greatly increased. This anhydrous acetic acid can be used to manufacture as much as 6,000 kilograms of heroin, while the legitimate global need for heroin is only 1,500 kilograms. Canadian Representative Sherman reported that Bulgaria's opium production was 4,000 kilograms in 1931, increased to 45,000 kilograms in 1932, and further increased by 20,000 kilograms to 65,000 kilograms in 1933. Egyptian Representative Russell explained that in the Macedonian region of Bulgaria, farmers are switching to growing poppies because they cannot sell the tobacco and wheat they grow. Neighboring countries, seeing the profit, may also follow suit, and thus Macedonia has become a hotbed of drug addiction in Europe and the world. Italian Representative Cavasani expressed the hope that the Bulgarian government would take strict measures. The Bulgarian representative then spoke, saying that since the establishment of the new Bulgarian government, his duties in this matter have been revoked. However, the new government is determined to strictly fulfill its obligations, and the measures required by the Advisory Committee will also be taken. This he can guarantee. U.S. Representative Fuller then spoke again, requesting that France, Germany, and Bulgaria submit reports on the export and import of anhydrous acetic acid. The committee subsequently passed a draft resolution stating that Article 15 of the International Convention (established on July 13, 1931, and named the International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotics) stipulates the establishment of a special administrative agency to handle narcotics issues. Governments of all countries should submit reports to the Advisory Committee on the measures taken to establish this agency and the methods to prevent the illegal sale of narcotics. The governments of all countries should also collect information on the anti-drug efforts of various international and domestic narcotics prevention organizations and missionary agencies and report to the committee. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Opium Advisory Committee released shocking news yesterday regarding Bulgaria's illegal manufacture and sale of opium and narcotics, the Bulgarian representative declared today that the new government has dismissed the public health official mentioned by Egyptian Police Chief Russell. The new government has requested the League of Nations to provide information at any time so that it can quickly and seriously deal with the sale of drugs. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<p>Minneapolis, The truck drivers' strike that lasted for many days in this city has now ended with the signing of an agreement between the union and employers. The agreement stipulates the rights that workers should enjoy for their years of service, prohibits discriminatory treatment of workers who join the union, and establishes a basis for arbitration to resolve disputes. It also includes clauses regarding wages and working hours. It is generally believed that this result is a victory for the workers. It is estimated that one person died and over a hundred were injured in this labor dispute. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Toledo, Ohio. Serious disturbances have been caused by a strike at an electrical appliance factory here. Protesters clashed with the National Guard.

<p>Istanbul Today, the government passed an order that foreign nationals employed in certain professions will be replaced by Turks. This order will affect thousands of foreign nationals residing in Turkey. From May 21st to June 21st, all foreign chauffeurs, barbers, tailors, shoemakers, hat makers, translators, guides, stock exchange staff, and musicians must be dismissed. From June 21st to September 21st, all foreign manual laborers must cease operations. From September 21st to November 21st, foreign nationals employed in restaurants, cafes, etc., or street vendors must be dismissed. From November 21st to January 21st, 1935, foreign-owned photography studios and printing houses must cease operations. From January 21st to March 21st, 1935, foreign nationals selling state monopoly goods, performers, singers, and shipping merchants must cease operations. From March 21st to May 21st, all business managers, government employees, and foreign staff in the Turkish government must be dismissed. This order was originally scheduled to be implemented last year, but was delayed due to protests from various governments. The foreign nationals most affected are Greeks, Italians, Persians, and Americans, who have resided here for decades, so their livelihoods will be difficult to resolve. Some foreign nationals may change their citizenship to Turkish, otherwise they may be expelled from the country.

The Brazilian government may allow only 3,400 Japanese immigrants to enter each year, but according to Brazilian newspapers, due to different calculation methods, it may only allow 400 immigrants. Furthermore, there is a risk of further reductions in immigration in the future, which will be a major blow to Japanese immigrants. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian published a letter from Dr. Wang Jingchun, stating that Japan's solemn assurances to strictly abide by existing treaties and agreements with China can be contrasted with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, especially Article I. Yet Japan has seized China's richest four provinces and established a puppet government whose power, whether large or small, is controlled by the Japanese.

<p>(New York) The People's Forum reports that some quarters believe that Britain and the United States are about to hold talks on naval issues, with the intention of forming a common front to deal with Japan's demands to increase its navy, while also forming a British-American agreement to limit Japan's influence in Asia. However, official circles indicate that there is no such meaning, stating that at the initial talks of the naval conference, technical aspects of naval issues will be considered, without focusing on politics. In addition, the U.S. government is currently building four 10,000-ton cruisers with 6-inch caliber guns. When this plan was decided last winter, the British government advised Washington to postpone the construction plan, saying that naval issues would be renegotiated in the future. If the results deem it appropriate to build these cruisers, the U.S. government can then resume construction. The U.S. government did not heed this advice, and Congress has also approved government funding to build another three 10,000-ton cruisers, indicating that there are differences of opinion between the two sides. However, despite the U.S. Navy's addition of new ships, it has not exceeded the limits set by the Washington Treaty. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese government has notified the British government that Japan is prepared to participate in the initial talks of the 1935 Naval Conference. British experts familiar with this issue declare that the most ideal location for the 1935 Naval Conference is Paris, as it feels appropriate for such a conference not to be held in a country that is more directly involved. In addition, British strategy seems to be based on a new principle: that in the event of war, Britain's maritime communication with India should pass through the Cape of Good Hope, rather than through the Suez Canal. The British government believes that the eastern Mediterranean is vulnerable to air strikes, hence this new principle. It is likely that the British government will give instructions to the British delegation participating in the naval talks based on this new principle and determine its attitude accordingly.

<p>(Tianjin) The "China Youth League," organized by Japanese youth, has been very active here recently, so the possibility of unexpected incidents is still developing. When the Japanese ship Tianjin Maru arrived here on the 24th, a group of about 20 Japanese tried to prevent customs officers from inspecting luggage. Many of them wore badges of the "China Youth League" and carried large sticks. Customs officers then set up a rope barrier on the shore. Several Japanese jumped into the barrier and tried to drive away the customs officers. At that time, a customs officer reported to his superiors by telephone. A Japanese customs officer then arrived on the scene and told the Japanese to disperse. Reuters wired this incident that day, but a certain Western newspaper in Shanghai indicated that it was untrue. A Reuters reporter verified the previous news with responsible parties today and learned that the customs authorities are now considering ways to avoid the recurrence of such incidents, as Japanese people from the "China Youth League" always go to the dock to meet the ships from Dalian whenever they arrive in Tianjin. Yesterday afternoon, a senior foreign customs officer personally came to the dock to wait for the arrival of a certain Japanese ship from Dalian, and additional police were assigned to patrol the dock. Although several Japanese youths lingered on the shore at the time, no unexpected incidents occurred. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e105">Japanese Puppet Opium Policy - Establishes Daman Company - Capital of One Million Yuan - Poisoning the People of Four Provinces <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: It is an undeniable fact that Japan wants to use opium to destroy our race. According to investigations, among the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast, as many as 9 million are addicted to opium. They still consider this insufficient. Recently, in view of the opium purchases in Rehe Province and the Xingan West Branch Province, although they are carried out by the buyers designated by the various branches of the Rehe Opium Monopoly Bureau, the current purchase situation in various places has become a trend of individual competition because the buyers' organizations are scattered and lack centralized control. As a result, it is quite difficult to proceed with purchases and there is no way to start, and it has resulted in smuggling. The Japanese puppet authorities have now decided to adopt the organization of the Pseudo-Capital Monopoly Bureau as a countermeasure to this matter. Under the guidance of Takeuchi, the Japanese director of the Chengde Opium Monopoly Bureau, local opium merchants will be united to form the Daman Company, which specializes in purchasing opium produced within the jurisdiction of the Rehe Monopoly Bureau, ensuring that all opium produced goes into the Monopoly Bureau. The general manager of the company is the traitor Zhang Yuxuan, the deputy manager is the traitor Hu Mojie. In addition, all powerful opium merchants in Chengde, Pingquan, Baliwei, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, Chifeng, Weichang, and other places are members of the association. The purchasing agents contribute funds to collect a capital of 1 million yuan in pseudo-currency, and the company was established on April 1st. On April 20th, it received the permission order from the Pseudo-Ministry of Finance. The company plans to purchase 10 million yuan worth of opium in Rehe Province and the Xingan West Branch Province. The Monopoly Bureau charges a handling fee of about one dime per tael for the opium. Since its establishment, it has purchased about 300,000 taels of opium. The company's activities and the locations of the branch offices are listed in detail below: (1) Locations of branch offices and capital allocation: Chengde 40,000, Pingquan 200,000, Lingyuan 70,000, Chaoyang 200,000, Chifeng 300,000, Weichang 200,000. (2) Sub-branches: 5 in the Chengde jurisdiction, 2 in the Pingquan jurisdiction, 4 in the Chifeng jurisdiction, 1 in the Weichang jurisdiction, 3 in the Lingyuan jurisdiction, 5 in the Chaoyang jurisdiction, and branches are also planned to be opened in Fengning, Anjiangtun, and Tiantuzhen. (3) Anti-smuggling measures: 15 secret investigation teams are currently dispatched to the customs and provincial borders and are currently conducting investigations.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Details of the Martyrdom of the Rehe Righteous Army in the Anti-Japanese War - Righteous Army Liu Liangshan Kills 400 Japanese Soldiers - Exhausted Ammunition and No Reinforcements, Surrounded by the Enemy, He Commits Suicide <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Wujiazi, Sanjiazi, Weijiagou area, the largest base of the Rehe Righteous Army for the past two years, has been subjected to sieges, burnings, and killings by the Japanese army. According to people from Rehe who recently spoke about the details, Liu Cunqi, commander of the 9th Division of the Rehe National Salvation Army, alias Liangshan, was the bravest of the Rehe righteous army. Previously, he fought with thousands of Japanese troops in Wujiazi and Weijiagou. More than a thousand righteous soldiers and civilians died in this battle. At that time, Liu, wielding two guns, broke through the encirclement and fled into the Dongshan mine tunnel in Weijiagou. Because there were many tunnels, the Japanese army assigned two soldiers to guard each tunnel and withdrew after ten days. Afterwards, the people entered the tunnel and found that Liu had committed suicide. Only one bullet remained in the pistol he was carrying. Those who saw this could not help but weep. Since the Eastern Incident, many patriots in the Northeast have risen up to resist Japan. Few can lead by example and not fear sacrifice like Mr. Liu. As for running out of ammunition and being trapped by the enemy, he still ended his life by suicide to show his steadfast will. It can be said that he was benevolent and righteous to the extreme. No wonder those who saw it wept bitterly. Mr. Liu was originally a sheep butcher. He joined the army in his twenties. Everyone in the Liaoxi area knew Liangshan. Liu had a bald head, so he called himself Liangshan. In mid-January of the previous year, he led patriotic youths from the Northeast to organize the righteous army and recovered Jinxi County. Within more than 20 days, he killed 300 to 400 Japanese soldiers. Japanese newspapers reported that the Battle of Jinxi was one of the battles in which the Japanese army suffered the most casualties after the Battle of Jiangqiao by Ma Zhanshan. The Liaoxi Righteous Army always claimed to be part of Liu's unit. The Japanese army was shocked by his courage and dared not advance. Mr. Liu initially served as the commander of the 36th Route of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, and later served as the commander of the 9th Division of the Northeast National Salvation Army. The army attacked Yi on October 20th of the previous year and attacked Jin on the 25th. Liu was responsible for the main force in both. He accumulated more than 100 mu of land, had an old wife, and an eldest son about 22 years old, who was married and had a grandson. He also had a second son over ten years old. Now they are all drifting about in unknown places. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Fourth Army's Work After Stationing in Longgang: Officers Supervise Road Construction, Soldiers Farm for the People <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the fifth campaign against the communists began, the speed of the Northern Route Army's advance has truly set a new record in communist suppression. After the Sixth Route Army captured Shanggu and Longgang, they immediately began building blockhouses and roads. The 59th and 90th Divisions of the Fourth Army made the most effort. The officers of the army went out every day to supervise the work. Although the materials used were locally sourced, they did not harm the people in the slightest. The roadbed was solid, the road surface smooth, and trees were planted along the edges in an orderly manner. The pavilions and public restrooms were also built in the most rational way, making it a model highway in Jiangxi. Furthermore, in the Shanggu and Quejiaping areas, many villages and houses were burned down by the Red bandits, and the residents were also forced to move elsewhere, unable to return, which delayed spring plowing. The 90th Division, after stationing there, used local bamboo, wood, and thatch to build barracks, creating a camp that stretched for ten miles. At night, the lights shone brightly, resembling a city night scene, showing no signs of desolation. The officers and soldiers of the division rested there, climbing mountains and peaks several times a day, training diligently, and showing great spirit, fully demonstrating the vigor of modern soldiers. The nearby fields, because many people had not returned, were about to become barren. Division Commander Ou Zhen and Chief of Staff Huang Zhanchun, believing that spring plowing could not be abandoned, specifically ordered their subordinates to farm for the people, personally leading officers and soldiers to the fields to plant rice seedlings, setting an example for all units. High-ranking officials, after riding horses and reprimanding, then tilling the land themselves, their interest ran high. They plowed and harrowed, looking just like old farmers. The officers and soldiers were happy and harmonious, working hard to cultivate the land. In two days, they planted dozens of acres of fields. The people were all grateful and spread the word, happily coming back one after another. It is heard that orders were also given to officers and soldiers of each regiment to allocate labor to farm for the people, so that the residents could return and harvest. Upon investigation, the bandit areas have been ravaged by the bandits for many years, and now they are seeing the light of day again. The Fourth Army has always been known for its bravery in battle and strict discipline. Now it can also get close to the people, who deeply love and support it. The people's hearts and minds are enough to affect the success or failure of the suppression campaign. Seeing this, it is anticipated that the pacification of the Red bandits will not be far off.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangbei Six Tang Rivers are crucial for transportation, irrigation, and drinking water for Huaiyin, Suqian, Siyang, Shuyang, Lianshui, Donghai, and Guanyun counties. Since construction began on January 1 of this year, the project has progressed extremely rapidly. The project within the boundaries of Huaiyin and Siyang counties has been completed, and the remaining counties are expected to be completed in the near future. The progress of the river construction and its recent situation are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>This dredging project of the Six Tang Rivers is being carried out entirely in accordance with the three principles determined at the Jiangsu Province Six Tang Rivers Dredging Conference last year: (1) Deepening the riverbed from Xiji to Longgou to ensure smooth discharge; (2) Widening the dikes and canals from Guji to Longgou to increase capacity; (3) Repairing all dikes to prevent flooding. It is estimated that 2 million cubic meters of earth will be dredged and 3.5 million cubic meters of earth will be used for dike repairs. The amount of earthwork, food, and number of workers recruited by each county were also determined by the conference. The lowest price for dike construction was 4 cents per cubic meter, the highest was 6 cents, averaging 5 cents, which was temporarily decided by the engineering office based on local conditions and distance. The excavation of river earth cost 7 cents per cubic meter of mud, and 1 dime per cubic meter of sand and gravel, averaging 8.5 cents per cubic meter, totaling more than 600,000 yuan in labor costs. The number of workers recruited was estimated at 8,000 in Suqian, 6,000 in Siyang, 4,000 in Huaiyin, 14,000 in Shuyang, 10,000 in Lianshui, 6,000 in Donghai, and 12,000 in Guanyun. After the conference closed on November 30, the provincial government immediately appointed Xu Dingkang, director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, as the director of the Six Tang Rivers Dredging Project. Xu departed from Yangzhou for Qing on December 9 and established the engineering office on the 10th, dividing the entire river project into five sections, with one engineer assigned to each section. After that, the river channel was surveyed, and the survey was completed by the end of the year. Dredging began on January 1 of this year, but due to the Lunar New Year, work could not proceed quickly. Later, the engineering office repeatedly ordered the counties to work hard, and the project began to proceed actively. The project within the boundaries of Huaiyin was completed on April 10, Siyang was completed on April 20, and the rest are also 70% or 80% complete. It is expected that the project will be fully completed by the end of May (26th).</p>
<h3 id="e110">Suzhou: The Religious and Philosophical Research Society Promotes Superstition <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Inside the North Temple on Pingmen Road, a so-called Religious and Philosophical Research Society has recently been established, causing a sensation in society and a frenzy throughout the city. The detailed situation and analysis of its content are as follows:</p>
<p>The society has a Founder's Hall, with an image of a certain Xiao in the center, neither Confucian nor Buddhist, with his hair tied up and holding a clean bottle. In front of the image is a table with an incense burner burning sandalwood, and in front of the table are more than twenty futons. In addition, there is another Light Hall, with a yellow cloth like a screen in the center, and an offering table in front with incense, flowers, and fresh fruit offerings. Two rows of futons are also arranged in front of the table. All who enter to worship must take off their hats and shoes, and enter silently, performing the three kneelings and nine kowtows. Moreover, it is not for ordinary people to enter. Only those who have a certain reputation in society and are considered to have innate good roots can be guided in by people from the society. It is said that after performing the ceremony, gazing at the screen will allow one to see the images of various gods and bodhisattvas as one wishes, but in the end, it is just a kind of rumor. Those from all walks of life who join, regardless of gender, can do so with a member's introduction, and by paying the fee as usual. The procedure is to first worship the image of the founder, kneeling on the futon for about two hours, called "receiving light," and then enter the Light Hall to worship as usual. In this way, one already has the supernatural power to heal people. The society claims to mix Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and worships the founder Xiao and establishes a separate sect. It takes not feeling a pulse and not using medicine to heal people as its work. After joining the society, one must sacrifice everything and dedicate oneself to the society, even women. The reason is that so-called "adult gentlemen" also join to call on others, so many believe in it. Among the gods worshiped by the people in the society, some never get to see the teacher Xiao in their lives. The other day, he suddenly arrived and gave a public lecture and hosted a vegetarian meal. However, the way Xiao spoke of healing was by silently reciting the positive energy of the twenty characters of loyalty, forgiveness, integrity, and virtue, which is different from the "Bodhisattva save you" that his disciples proclaimed. According to the general public, Xiao is similar to the so-called "senior brother" in the previous Boxer Rebellion. Since the establishment of the society, in less than twenty days, the number of patients from far and near who came to seek treatment has been no less than several thousand per day. Currently, party members Jiang Yuqi and Zhu Mengmei have submitted a report to the county party headquarters, stating that the society has not yet been ordered by the party headquarters to be allowed to prepare, yet it has already claimed to heal people without using medicine or feeling a pulse, causing foolish men and women to flock to it, with no less than one or two thousand people going to seek treatment every day. The method of healing is to have a square of gauze, with the practitioner writing talismans on it, burning it into ashes, and having the patient take it, saying that it can cure the disease. However, those who have been treated have not seen any efficacy, and it is even said that there is a danger of worsening the condition. Such open promotion of superstition, confusing the foolish people, disrupting social perception, and harming the lives of the people, should be reported to the county government, ordering the Public Security Bureau to quickly disband it. According to the report, County Party Committee Standing Member Zhu has sent a letter to the county government to investigate and deal with the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e111">A Boat from Xuzhuang Robbed En Route <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>A boat traveling between Suzhou and Xuzhuang, owned by Ge Huangyao, was passing near Shangfang Mountain in Shihu on the afternoon of the 25th when it was suddenly encountered by a bandit boat with four bandits who, armed with guns, boarded the boat and robbed the passengers. All six passengers were searched, and more than 100 yuan were stolen. Afterwards, the boat owner reported the robbery to the Public Security Bureau to pursue the stolen goods.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Wuxi: Implementation of Cocoon Business Control Leads to Firm Disputes Between Officials and Merchants <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Since the Construction Department issued the regulations for the control of the cocoon business, the cocoon businesses in this county have had many objections. Therefore, at 2:00 PM on the 24th, an emergency meeting was held at the Silk Factory Association to discuss and decide on four measures to submit to the authorities for a petition to postpone the implementation. The situation was recorded in this newspaper, stating that all requests for funds from unregistered cocoon businesses should be rejected, etc. The disputes between officials and merchants were quite firm. Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate of this county, and Cai Jingde, the deputy director of the model district, considering that the cocoon market was approaching and could not be delayed, went to the province the other day to ask Director Shen of the Construction Department for instructions on how to resolve the matter. After receiving the report, Director Shen was quite firm, stating that the control of the cocoon business is one of the provincial measures to rescue the entire silk industry. The Chinese silk industry has reached its most dangerous point. If improvements are not urgently sought, it will inevitably suffer from international competition and fall into bankruptcy. The livelihoods of farmers and the status of merchants will be fundamentally affected. In any case, there can be no changes. As for the collection of improvement fees, Zhejiang Province has already implemented it last autumn and is collecting it slightly again this year, so there is a precedent. Moreover, the improvement fee is specifically used for improving the silk industry and is different from donations and taxes. If there are a few individuals who do not understand the situation and disregard the future interests of farmers, deliberately obstructing the progress of the project, they will be severely punished. Regarding those who do not follow the procedures for registration and start operating, their cocoon licenses will be revoked. If anyone collects cocoons without registering and paying the deposit, once discovered, the dried cocoons will be confiscated, and a double improvement fee will be collected as a punishment. After receiving the instructions, Yan and Cai returned to Wuxi yesterday morning (26th) and decided to follow the instructions given by Director Shen. Therefore, it is feared that it will not be resolved for a while.</p>

<p>The case of promoting the new system of weights and measures in this county has been implemented by most industries one after another. Only the rice and bean industry has been slow to implement it. After repeated urging by the authorities, the Rice and Bean Industry Association has successively sent the measuring instruments used for county inspection. More than 340 pieces have already been inspected and qualified by the county government, and they can be unified.</p>
<h3 id="e114">A Major Silk and Iron Merchant Goes Bankrupt with Millions in Losses <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Zhaofu, a resident of Dongfeng in Zhouxin Town, is a major figure in the silk and iron industry, with assets of four to five million. His business operations cover various ports such as Shanghai, Hankou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Dalian. His father, Shunqing, was a fourth-rank Beijing official in the late Qing Dynasty and even co-founded the Xincheng Bank with Prince Qing Yikuang, causing a sensation for a time. After Shunqing's death, Zhaofu carried on his father's aspirations and continued the business he had created. In addition to the three silk factories in Wuxi, Yuchang, Shenchang, and Dingchang, he also has Xinyuanlai Smelting Workshop in Nanshi, Shanghai (jointly operated with the Hu family, with assets of 400,000), Yixu Wharf in Nanshi, Shanghai (with assets worth more than 100,000), Xinzhenyuan Smelting Workshop in Suzhou, Yucangxiang Iron Store in Suzhou (with assets of 100,000), Zhengchang Iron Store in Shanghai, and warehouses in Pudong, Zhengchangren Iron Store in Hankou, Shengyuan Oil Factory in Dalian (jointly operated with Ye Hongying), etc. He also owns real estate worth more than 20,000 yuan in Urakami, Nagasaki, Japan, a residence on Qipu Road in Shanghai, more than 3,000 mu of farmland and street houses in the northern part of Wuxi and Zhouxin Town. In recent years, Zhou's business has failed, causing the Shanghai Zhengchang Iron Store and the Hankou Zhengchangren Iron Store to close down one after another. The residence on Qipu Road in Shanghai and the warehouse in Pudong have also been mortgaged. Recently, due to tight liquidity, he has declared bankruptcy, with losses reaching more than 1.5 million. He has entrusted lawyer Sun Zuhong to liquidate the assets. For the debts owed to banks and money shops, the three silk factories, Yuchang, Dingchang, and Shenchang, have been mortgaged, but this is still far from enough. For the debt of more than 200,000 owed to depositors, it is planned to use more than 680 mu of farmland to repay the debt, with each 1,000 yuan yielding about 1.3 mu of farmland. The creditors do not agree, resulting in no result. A creditor group has now been jointly organized to negotiate. However, it is said that Zhou Zhaofu still has 400,000 in deposits in the Bank of China, and another 2,000 mu of farmland, which he claims to have donated to the charity estate.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Jiangyin: Salted Yellow Croaker Refuses to Collect Business Tax <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xiacheng, director of the Jiangjing Business Tax Bureau, sent a letter to the Fish and Northern Goods Industry Association, asking them to collect business tax on salted yellow croaker during the current yellow croaker season. The association immediately sent a letter to the Hupu Fish Industry Association in Changshu for consultation. According to the reply, the fish tax and fishery tax have long been exempted by the national government. Salted yellow croaker is collected from the ocean by fishing boats and is not transported for sale, which is different from the nature of business. Moreover, the likin tax has also been abolished long ago. Collecting tax on goods is a disguised business tax that is essentially a restoration of the likin tax, so the collection should be refused.</p>

<p>Gu Fengxiang, 65 years old, from Gujiazhai, Zouma Township, Second District, has a son, A Xiang, who is a butcher. On the morning of the 25th, the father and son went to Chenjiahang Town to buy wine and drink together. A Xiang drank wildly and became heavily drunk. After drinking, they still went home together. Fengxiang ordered his family to sun-dry salted fish. A Xiang opposed this and, after a disagreement, A Xiang went to the room and took out the sharp knife he used to slaughter pigs, and stabbed his father in the upper thigh, penetrating his lower abdomen. Fengxiang immediately fainted and soon died. The local village police officer, Meng Zhengu, reported the incident to the Nanxiang Public Security Sub-bureau, which dispatched patrol chief Sun Yuzhen and police officers to investigate and confirm the facts. However, the murder weapon was missing. A Xiang was taken to the sub-bureau and sent to the County Public Security Bureau with a written report. Xue Bingyang, the director of the bureau, interrogated him. A Xiang confessed that he was 46 years old and that he had stabbed his father. He said that he stabbed him in the thigh around 9:00 AM that morning because he was drunk. He was transferred to the county government for detention that evening. The next morning, the hearing officer, Shao Ling, along with police officers, went to the countryside to investigate, verifying that he had been stabbed to death before his death, and ordered the family to prepare the coffin.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Address by the Head of the Delegation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Zhan Jingtang, the head of the Qingdao Industrial Inspection Delegation, reported, "Our delegation's mission in coming to Shanghai to inspect industry is twofold: First, Shanghai and Qingdao are the two major ports of China, with close geographical, commercial, and trade relations. Qingdao's Jiaozhou Bay sees imported goods worth over 50 million yuan in national currency annually. Given this important port, we must unite entrepreneurs, traders, and economists to pay special attention and jointly seek ways to protect our interests. Second, Qingdao has only a little over a decade of history since its recovery, during which it has experienced multiple civil wars, and the market has been extremely panicked. Since Mayor Shen took office, he has vigorously promoted industry and developed the market. In recent years, there has been a slight industrial foundation, but compared with the construction technology achievements of major factories in Shanghai, the difference is like heaven and earth. We hope that Shanghai entrepreneurs and technicians will provide more assistance and contributions. Third, the Qingdao port is so good, and the annual consumption is so large, while the inland industrial raw materials are abundant, such as coal, tobacco, peanuts, cowhide, wool, etc., which can be fully supplied. Every bit more of domestic goods sold is a bit more economic rights and interests recovered. We hope that gentlemen of the press will vigorously promote and advocate on behalf of the 400,000 compatriots in Qingdao, to regard Qingdao City as Qingdao for all Chinese people, and to build Qingdao into a Chicago of the United States, or a Manchester of the United Kingdom, and not to regard Qingdao as a 'Switzerland of the East,' a playground park within our country. Furthermore, our delegation believes that the press is the representative of public opinion, and we in the industrial sector especially regard the gentlemen of the press as our nurturers. Qingdao's industry is nascent, and Shanghai newspapers are popular throughout the country and overseas. A single call from a high place will be echoed by ten thousand mountains. Therefore, new industries in Qingdao, such as needle making, gelatin powder production, cowhide glue production, and China Stone Company, rely entirely on sales to have hope of development. The Shanghai press is the mentor of our nascent industry in Qingdao. This is also what our delegation members sincerely pray for."</p>

<p>Mr. Ma Yinliang, representing the press, rose and replied, saying, "We are deeply honored by your delegation's invitation. Many people from various places come to Shanghai for sightseeing, but the ones that leave the deepest impression on us are none other than your delegation. Your delegation is prefixed with 'Qingdao,' and these two words evoke thoughts of it falling into foreign hands and the various unfortunate events that have occurred since its recovery, which are unbearable to contemplate. Secondly, your delegation takes industrial inspection as its mission, breaking with the regionalism of the past, which will undoubtedly be beneficial to the development of our country's industrial future. Now that we are about to part, I would like to offer a toast on behalf of the hosts to wish all of you good health and the development of Qingdao's industry."</p>

<p>This time, the delegation's visit to Shanghai has been well received by all walks of life. Now that the delegation's inspection is complete and they will be leaving Shanghai tomorrow, in order to express their gratitude and maintain connections, they have specifically arranged to hold a return banquet for all circles at the New Asia Restaurant at 7 pm today.

<h3 id="e131">China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou Line Increases Flights and Changes Flight Times, Effective from the First of Next Month <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou line is now scheduled to increase one flight starting from the first of next month, and at the same time, the flight times will be advanced. The opening hours of the Shanghai-Beiping line will also be changed, and it has been decided to implement it on June 1. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Increased Flights <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The company's Shanghai-Hankou line was originally scheduled to fly between Shanghai and Hankou every day from Tuesday to Sunday at 8 am, and arrive separately at 3 pm. Because the business of this line is unusually developed, and passengers and mail are quite crowded, the company, in order to facilitate travel, will also fly normally on Mondays, which were originally rest days, adding a flight to meet the needs. That is, there will be flights every day of the week. The company has decided to implement this from next month (June) 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Earlier Flights <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In addition, the company, in view of the fact that the summer season is approaching and the weather is getting hotter, will also advance the flight time. The east- and west-bound flights between Shanghai and Hankou will all take off at 7 am every day, and arrive separately at 2:05 pm. At the same time, the flight time of the Shanghai-Beiping line will also be advanced. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will depart from Beiping to the south at 6:30 am, and on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, it will depart from Shanghai to the north at 6 am, all arriving at 3:30 pm in the afternoon.</p>

The original text reads, "It has been found that from June 1st, the takeoff times of the company's Shanghai-Hankou line and Shanghai-Beiping line aircraft will be advanced (times as above). From the same day, the Shanghai-Hankou line will also be changed to daily flights, with flights on Mondays as well. Accordingly, this letter is to inform you that you should check the station's advertisements and correct them one day in advance, and send the style to us for verification after publication.

<p>The association specially sent a letter to the Shanghai City Council yesterday contributing rent reduction opinions. The original text reads, "The Shanghai rent reduction movement has lasted for four months and has become a prerequisite for Shanghai's prosperity, which has attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign people. Recently, I learned that your council was instructed by the municipal government to discuss the rent issue. The following are the opinions of a humble person for your reference: (1) I believe that housing is one of the four major elements of life and is indispensable to mankind. Nowadays, the prices of clothing and food have fallen greatly compared to before. The reason is related to social economy, that is, the prices of clothing and food change with the social economy, and so does the rent. How was the rent price before the rise of trust transactions? Anyone who has been in Shanghai for a long time can tell. In the past ten years or so, whether it is a resident or a store, although it seems to reluctantly bear this high rent on the surface, the desire for rent reduction has been eager to try. Therefore, the current widespread rent reduction movement can get a hundred responses with one call, and the momentum is rapid, which is enough to show that it is entirely due to accumulation and anger, which is a natural principle among human beings. Since the outbreak of the two major changes of 'September 18' and 'January 28', the social economy has felt extremely uneasy, and Shanghai's prosperity is about to go bankrupt. The so-called large price reductions in the current business market are everywhere. Others such as the agricultural industry summons, the unemployment of workers, and the increasing number of rent arrears cases in the court. Based on this, it is enough to prove that the reduction of rent is closely related to Shanghai's prosperity. This should be noted. (2) I heard that the silver and money industries have deep concerns about the rent reduction issue. The reason is that rent is the interest on real estate. If the rent is reduced, it will inevitably affect the property price. Because many Shanghai houses are mortgaged to the silver and money industries, the trend of rent reduction should not be allowed to grow. However, it is known that this is a rigid view. It should be known that the silver and money industries have never stopped mortgaging silk, rice, yarn, etc. Judging from past facts, after being mortgaged, the prices have fallen miserably, which is often heard. The real estate mortgage is the same. Why worry? The current rent reduction has been forced by the situation. For example, in the distant past, countries such as Germany and Japan had government orders to reduce rent. In recent years, such as our country's rent reduction in Nanjing, the Central Political Council promulgated rent price standards. Our association dares to say that the rent reduction movement is actually beneficial to the society. All industries are members of the society. If the society is beneficial, the mortgaging industry is not without profit. May I ask if the increase in Shanghai's land price is not caused by the general tenants? The tenants gather together in that place, each earning a living, becoming a market, so that the land price increases day by day. The so-called sacrifice by the public to create wealth for individuals is explained in detail in the third lecture of the Principle of People's Livelihood. This should be noted. (3) The rent reduction methods are full of disputes. Some advocate the dominant area theory, some advocate the interest rate theory, and some advocate the house price theory. However, Shanghai has a vast area and densely packed houses. If the above theory is used, it is necessary to start an investigation. However, those who do not understand the overall situation will inevitably conceal the facts. It is difficult to obtain the correct information in a few years. It is appropriate to disturb the society in order to save the society. I have seen that the methods set by the Rent Reduction Committee are based on the year of construction, which is suitable for the urgent needs of the society. This rent reduction movement is originally a last resort, aiming to prosper the market, help each other, unite, and save the crisis together, and there is no hostility between them. This rent reduction method should be transferred to the municipal government for adoption, and the established method should be implemented immediately. This should be noted. In summary, it seems to be practical and easy to implement. I hope you will check it carefully."</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after all the workers and staff of the new factory of British American Tobacco Company declared a general strike, the situation was quite serious. The party and government agencies paid great attention. The municipal government specially summoned the responsible persons of the cigarette workers' unions in the five districts yesterday to go to the talk, so as to find a way to mediate. The strike committee telegraphed Chairman Chiang requesting that the company be ordered to resume operations quickly to quell the dispute. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Stalemate <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>There are more than 5,000 workers and Chinese staff in the new factory of British American Tobacco Company. In order to support the workers of the old factory, they declared a general strike on the 24th, resulting in the complete cessation of work in all departments. Even the cigarettes in the warehouse could not be shipped. Yesterday, the workers of the factory continued to strike. The British American tugboat drivers also joined in after the union sent a letter of warning yesterday. The company hired White Russian drivers.</p>
<p>Inside the factory, such as the engine room and furnace room, there were still a few White Russians working, while all others were completely shut down. The company has not made any indication, and the labor side has not sent anyone to negotiate with the company. Both sides are still in a stalemate.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Municipal Government Questioning <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the situation of the British American strike is serious. If it is not resolved quickly, it will not only be a matter of workers' livelihoods, but also affect local security. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to properly mediate, it also summoned the responsible persons of the cigarette workers' unions in the five districts to go to the talk yesterday morning at 11 o'clock. The labor side sent Chen Peide and Lou Jingguan. Secretary-General Yu received them and inquired in detail about the reasons for the plant closure and the workers' strike. The representatives also requested that the municipal government quickly order the factory to open immediately to quell the strike. Yu said that he accepted and hoped to inform the workers to strictly abide by the order and not to expand the dispute, so as to avoid causing other incidents.</p>

The association has ordered all workers to strictly abide by the order.

<p>Guangxi Province has always been known for its poor people and barren land. Through the repeated efforts of the authorities in recent years, it has become somewhat scaled, and construction work must rely on economy as a prerequisite. Previously, when Chairman Huang Xuchu of Guangxi Province passed through Shanghai during the Fourth Plenary Session, he consulted with the financial circles in Shanghai on investment matters. Guo Shun promised to invest 3 million yuan to help the construction of the province. After that, financial circles Jin Guobao and industry circles Zheng Yizhi and others went to inspect. It is learned that Guo Shun and others have raised 2 million yuan (half from Shanghai and half from Guangxi) with Huang Zhongyue, Director of the Finance Department of the province, to establish a Yongkang Industrial Company in Wuzhou, specializing in communicating the industrial undertakings between Shanghai and Guangxi. After this matter was actively carried out by both Shanghai and Guangxi, Huang Zhongyue of Guangxi Province sent a telegram to Guo stating that the Yongkang Company has elected directors and supervisors at the promoters' meeting in Wuzhou, established a board of directors, and elected you (ie, Guo Shun) as chairman and Zheng Yizhi as general manager. Yongkang is fortunate to have obtained talents. The industrial future of Guangxi Province is deeply relied upon. I also hope that you will come to Guangxi to preside over the overall plan, so that you can always knock on your respect. The company has already been prepared and will be established in Wuzhou on July 3.</p>

Qian Xinzhi, manager of the Shanghai Four Bank Savings Association, went to Qiqi Road yesterday morning at 8:45 to meet with Huang. He left at 10:15. According to his interview with a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the visit to Huang this morning was purely a casual chat and there was no contact whatsoever. However, according to other sources, the meeting between Huang and Qian yesterday morning lasted for one hour and thirty minutes. It is expected that the content of the conversation may not be as simple as he claimed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously stated in a letter from the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association that, according to the precedent of Qingdao, it was requested to submit to the Ministry of Finance that all peanut native products exported from Shanghai and transported to various ports in the country be exempted from transit tax for two years. The original text has been seen in previous reports. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance approved the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that "Received the presentation. It has been checked that peanuts, peanut kernels, and peanut oil shipped from Shanghai have been approved by the Ministry to reduce the originally established export tax rate by 60%, limited to those shipped abroad within three months, that is, from May 26th to August 25th of this year, and the General Taxation Department has been ordered to instruct the customs to comply with it. As for the request to exempt the transit tax, the Ministry has carefully verified it. Peanuts and other products are large Shandong native products, which have a direct relationship with the market in Qingdao, which is different from those transported to Shanghai. Moreover, Shanghai is a collection area for various goods, and the amount of transit peanuts has no significant impact on the prosperity of the market. It cannot be compared with Qingdao, which regards peanut trade as its main business. The request is not approved. Please inform us."</p>

<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, "Dear Sirs, according to a letter from the Second District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens (located on Gongguan Road), according to a letter from the silver shop industry in the French Concession, our industry has always had no other miscellaneous taxes besides the house tax. Before the French Municipal Council levied the classified business sanitation tax, it first used the silver shop antique sanitation tax as a trial product. Our industry has already recognized the silver shop tax, and of course cannot recognize the classified sanitation tax again. Unexpectedly, the French Municipal Council suddenly collected the classified business sanitation tax from our industry this year, which means that in addition to the silver shop sanitation tax, there is also a so-called classified sanitation tax, which is actually a double tax on one place and one industry. Our colleagues find it difficult to accept. Therefore, we have sent a letter asking your council to convey to the French Municipal Council to exempt the double tax. We hope you will check it."</p>

<h3 id="e152">Report of the Red Swastika Society on the Handling of Disaster Relief in Ping'a: 2,500 Hectares of Fertile Land Dredged; Two-Thirds Still Lack Funding <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society, due to the severe flooding in Dongping and Dong'a counties in Shandong province last year, specially raised relief funds to be delivered to the Jinan Red Swastika Society for emergency relief. This included dredging the Yellow River estuary in Dong'a, south to Songjiatun in Dongping. They initially raised 7,600 yuan in relief funds. Together with donations from the Shandong Provincial Relief Association and the Northeast Charity Federation, the total amounted to 25,600 yuan. It is now reported that the disaster relief office has submitted a report on the dredging situation: "This Society's disaster relief efforts in Ping'a have been supported by philanthropists from various provinces and the Provincial Relief Association. A large-scale porridge distribution center was set up in the disaster area. Simultaneously, a disaster relief work office was organized to dredge the entire Yellow River estuary. Starting from the Yellow River estuary in Dong'a in the north to Songjiatun in Dongping in the south, the total length is 40 *li*. The northern section, with the highest siltation and the most difficult work, accounts for one-third of the total length. This construction project started with this section. A total of 4,800 to 6,000 laborers from the disaster area were gathered. Each person was paid 13 cents for food daily. Foremen were appointed from the village heads, totaling 357 people, each receiving 23 cents for food daily. It was originally planned that this dangerous section would be completed in 20 days. However, due to two rainfalls and one snowfall, the work was delayed. In addition, the passage of the Liu bandit caused some work delays, extending the project to 32 days before this dangerous section was completed. The total expenditure was 20,421 yuan and 50 cents, with grain contributions from villages valued at over 20,000 yuan, totaling more than 40,000 yuan. Only one-third of the entire project has been completed. This is a significant deviation from the original estimate. According to last winter's estimate by the Dongping County Government, the entire 40 *li* project would only require 20,000 yuan. However, after actual construction began, it was realized that the original estimate was vastly inaccurate. The county government only knew that the work within Dongping was not very difficult, but they were unaware that the section within Dong'a had been severely silted by the Yellow River last autumn, as high as a hill. At this time, appeals for external funds were constant, and villages also struggled to provide grain. Furthermore, with the planting season approaching, work had to be stopped to release the water. It is estimated that around 2,500 hectares of fields have been drained, all planted with barley, interspersed with sorghum. This was only possible due to the support and promotion of various philanthropists. However, in the Ping'a area, more than 5,000 hectares of fields are flooded. This dredging project has only covered one-third, draining half of the flooded fields. If the remaining two-thirds of the southern section can be dredged, all 5,000 hectares of fields can be drained, which is an urgent matter for fundamental disaster relief. According to the project undertaker, the southern section is easier than the northern section. Another 25,000 yuan is needed for completion. Therefore, over the past month, requests have been repeatedly submitted to the Shandong Provincial Government. The result was an approval to continue funding with only 5,000 yuan, which is a significant shortfall, creating the risk of failing at the last hurdle. It is earnestly hoped that philanthropists in Shanghai will continue to provide assistance, so that the entire project can be completed, and all 5,000 hectares of flooded fields can be drained. Not only will the people be spared from drowning, allowing them to join other counties where they can cultivate their land, but also the good deeds of the philanthropists will have boundless merit. Furthermore, the Qinghe Gate is silted up by backflow from the Yellow River every year. If this project is fully completed, it can only guarantee a wheat harvest for two to three years. Continuous dredging every year would be difficult. Now, all village leaders from the disaster area have jointly decided to build a mud dredging boat. During the slack season, the boat will be used for dredging, requiring less effort and achieving greater results. This way, the benevolence of philanthropists will never be wasted. The cost of building the boat is around 80,000 yuan, which will be funded by the harvests from the drained land." This statement was made jointly.</p>

Zhenhuan and others, as seamen, cannot bear to procrastinate and cause future harm. We hereby earnestly resign. Please approve. He Zhenhuan, Wang Yongsheng, Mu Yeyi, bowing."</p>

<p>Since the increase in import duties on foreign sugar, the amount of foreign sugar smuggled into China for sale in the past year has accounted for as much as four-tenths of the total. This has not only caused significant losses in customs revenue but has also severely impacted the business operations of sugar merchants. In order to strictly investigate the source of smuggled sugar, the Tianjin Customs Bureau secretly dispatched special agents to various ports along the coast of North China for secret inspections. After several months of investigation, it was discovered that the source of smuggled sugar was from Chuanjiacun and Xinggepu near Dalian, where foreign sugar was secretly loaded onto ships. After leaving the port, the sugar was transferred to various sailing vessels along the coast, which then privately transported it to Qingdao, Haizhou, and areas outside the Wusongkou estuary, before being smuggled into the interior. In the past year, the amount smuggled into China has reached several million yuan. It is reported that the Dalian authorities in Japan have been notified to closely cooperate in the investigation and crackdown.</p>

<p>At 15 Taixing Lane, Baoshan Road in Zhabei, a *shikumen* residence housed Hu Peigeng, a Mi Bo person from the Shunchang Machine Factory on Baotong Road. Qian Shulou had previously rented to Bao Wanglin, a postal worker, and the attic room was occupied by artist Shi Ruihua, all three families residing. Hu was the second landlord. The factory specializes in producing various flashlights. Since the boycott of foreign goods and the promotion of domestic products, business has flourished, resulting in a slight surplus, which attracted the attention of bandits. At 7:30 AM yesterday, while Jiang Dongshi, the maid of the Hu family, was washing a chamber pot at the back door, four bandits wearing long and short gowns suddenly rushed in from the</p>

<p>They dragged the maid in, pulled out pistols, and warned her to keep quiet. They then herded the men and women of the Hu family into a back room behind the parlor and confined them. They then rummaged through boxes and chests, looting Hu Peigeng's jade ring, gemstone ring, pearl necklace, etc., Shi Ruihua's gold ring, woolen jacket, etc., and Bao Wanglin's leather suitcase, containing sixteen yuan in banknotes, eleven cents in small change. Just as they were about to escape with the stolen goods, the bandits, when entering the door, had not noticed Bao Wanglin's wife buying broad beans from a vendor outside the Hu family's back door. The vendor, through the glass door</p>

Upon seeing the barricaded front and back doors of the house, District Chief Liang immediately ordered the police detectives to surround the residence, while prohibiting other residents from going outside. At the same time, he directed police chief Wang Molin and others to cross the wall from the roof of No. 10 and climb to the sun deck of No. 15. Upon receiving the order, the police detectives all rushed forward with valor. The bandits, hearing the urgent knocking on the door below, knew things were amiss and hurriedly turned back upstairs to escape. At this time, the police chief and others who had crossed the wall from the roof of No. 10 had reached the sun deck of No. 15. Seeing their escape routes blocked front and back, the bandits desperately opened fire. The police detectives also returned fire, and the sound of gunfire was as intense as</p>

They then saw another bandit resisting arrest at the bottom of the stairs and quickly aimed at his chest and fired a shot, hitting him and causing him to fall to the ground dead, bleeding profusely, a gruesome sight. They seized a six-inch revolver, "No. 29157," a cartridge clip, and two remaining bullets. All items were taken to the district.

<h3 id="e166">The Mainland News Praises New China One Village; the Environment is Beautiful, Peaceful and Quiet; Equipment is Particularly Complete <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>According to the *Mainland News* of May 24th, the population and houses of Shanghai are increasing day by day. Both old and new residents want to find spacious housing and a quiet environment, but due to the weakness of social economic forces, this has become the most serious problem today. Some people live in the bustling areas of the concessions. Because of the high rents, living in "dovecotes" has become a popular catchphrase. The houses are small, the air is full of smoke and dust, and it is noisy. Some people move to the Shanghai West area because it is more suitable for living conditions, but they suffer from the economic disadvantages. Therefore, the former live in apartments and find it as laborious as climbing mountains to go home, while the latter are too far away, resulting in dusty journeys. The New China Bank pays close attention to the housing problem in Shanghai and attempts to solve the housing problem for the general public with their enthusiasm for serving society. Therefore, they built New China One Village on West Sports Association Road in North Shanghai, with a moderate location, convenient transportation, a superior environment, and economic advantages. New China One Village covers an area of 50 *mu* and is only one *li* away from Hongkou Park. There are main roads connecting it to the Public Concession and the central district of Shanghai. The housing base in the new village has been demarcated. Trees are planted between houses, and there are clean and elegant lawns and gardens. Exquisite and beautiful houses are being built. When the entire project is completed in the future, it will certainly become the best and newest residential area in Shanghai. The purchase method for New China One Village housing is different from that of general real estate companies. The New China Bank knows that the general public lacks the full amount to purchase housing, so it adopts a method of paying in installments. The repayment is included in the rent, so it is very easy and imperceptible. After several years, the housing becomes owned by the resident. The village is surrounded by a beautiful and quiet countryside, without any of the hustle and bustle of the city, but with wide and flat roads and convenient transportation. By private car, it only takes 13 minutes, and by public bus, it only takes 22 minutes to travel between the new village and the Bund. In addition, there is a route to Tiantong'an and Jiangwan, which is where the Songhu Railway passes. Therefore, it is also very convenient for general merchants and women to live there. Although New China One Village is not in the concession area, various facilities are as convenient as in the concession. For example, water and electricity are supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and telephone calls can be made directly to the Public Concession and the French Concession. Water and electricity fees and rent are also cheaper than in the concession. In addition, the village is close to the school district, with kindergartens to universities at all levels, such as Shanghai Law School, Chizhi College, Fudan University, Patriotic Girls' School, and Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School. In the future, for the convenience of residents, a small vegetable market and post boxes will be set up. In addition to the above advantages, New China One Village also has a very superior outdoor sports environment. Usually, one can go to Hongkou Park for a walk, swim in the park's swimming pool, or ride horses on the open roads of Jiangwan. It is truly an ideal paradise.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Case of Liu Shuban and Others Being Accused is Concluded; the Prosecutor's Opinion is Divided into Two Parts; the Debate Was Concluded Yesterday and a Date Was Set for Sentencing <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The case of Liu Shuban and others, the former directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, being accused of embezzlement and harming the national treasury, was filed by the First Special District Procuratorate of the District Court. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui has repeatedly held court hearings to investigate the case, and the details have been reported in the newspapers many times. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu, together with prosecutor Zhong Qing, continued to hear the case of Liang Banxing, the secretary of the Great New Company Preparatory Office. Liang was summoned to court to investigate the circumstances of Zhao Baoshan using part of the commission obtained from the land purchase by the Savings and Remittance Bureau to subscribe to shares of the Great New Company. According to Liang, the company received 23,025 taels of silver from Yang Wutang, Yang Shude, Zhao Huiji, and other four households, equivalent to 30,000 Hong Kong dollars, which was paid by Zhao. He presented the receipt books and share subscription documents as evidence. Judge Liu then questioned Zhao Baoshan and Yang Peichang about the commission and how Zhao purchased shares of the Great New Company. After that, he presented the postal savings rules and repeatedly questioned Liu Shuban and others about the procedures for withdrawing savings with checks. Then, he ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Zhong first presented the prosecution's arguments, which were roughly divided into two parts: (1) the commission part of Zhao Baoshan and Yang Peichang, (2) the part of Liu Shuban and others trading in public bonds. Zhong then stated the reasons for the defendants' crimes in the public bond trading event, saying that according to common practice, when banks trade public bonds on behalf of customers, customers should first deposit a margin. However, the defendants' trading of public bonds on behalf of Dai Xunji advanced more than 400,000 yuan without calculating interest. And the 100,000 taels of silver deposited in Liu Jianhou's account, which they claimed to be a margin, was calculated daily. This clearly showed favoritism. In fact, this Dai Xunji account name was the defendant himself, intentionally creating a false name. Judging from his various actions, he has violated Articles 136, 140, and 366 of the Criminal Law. Next, he stated the reasons for the crimes of Zhao Baoshan and others obtaining illegal commissions, saying that the money obtained by the defendants twice for land purchases was 135,000 taels and 29,000 taels respectively. Yang Jianping was given 34,325 taels as a share. According to the custom of real estate transactions, the commission is usually 1% or 1.5% of the property value. However, the property value of Albert Road was 1.2 million taels, and the commission reached 150,000 taels, reaching a level of one-eighth. There has never been such an appalling commission. The defendants colluded with Yang Jianping to inflate the property value and openly share the spoils. The facts are clear and should be judged according to law. Then, the defense lawyers of the defendants, Liu Chongyou, Shi Jiong, Cao Shoulin, Zou Yu, and Liu Shifang, successively defended their clients. The court then ordered a date for sentencing.</p>

<p>Sheng Xingcun, formerly a Grand Guardian of the Qing Dynasty, resided at 526 Jing'an Temple Road. His residence was large and expansive, but due to the age of the buildings and the dilapidated walls, the rear buildings were being rebuilt. Therefore, all important chests and belongings of his descendants were placed in one room, named the storage room. It was sealed and entrusted to his servant, Ruan Ronggen, to guard. Ruan, a native of Anhui, was employed by Sheng's second concubine and had served for 20 years. He was usually very honest and without any vices. However, recently, due to a certain addiction, he became short on funds. After much deliberation, he took a risk. On the 22nd of this month, at 2:30 AM, before dawn, when all was quiet, he colluded with a relative, identified as Jia, to open the clothes chests in the storage room. They selected two chests of important clothes, valued at 9,554 yuan, and secretly stole them. They hired rickshaws to take them to a friend's place, planning to pawn them later. The matter was discovered by the Sheng residence when they noticed the seal on the chests had been torn. Upon closer inspection, they realized that clothes worth thousands of yuan had vanished. At the time, they did not know who had stolen them, and Ruan remained calm, continuing his duties as usual. Subsequently, Huang Dazhong, representing the Sheng residence, reported the situation to the Xinzha Police Station. The station immediately dispatched Chinese Detective Tang Jian, Yao Yuanlong, Detective Lu Gendi, Jiang Juwu, Constable Xia Yeshan, and foreign detective Qijasheng. After days of detailed investigation, they found Ruan Ronggen, a servant of the Sheng residence, to be suspicious and evasive. They took Ruan to the police station for questioning yesterday. Ruan confessed to the theft and led the Chinese and foreign detectives to 334 Meibai Ke Road and 97 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, where they arrested two other suspects, Dou Guanghua and Yin Bengen. They also recovered most of the stolen goods, clothing worth over 7,700 yuan, and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Gan Jingguang, presented the case and requested a postponement to investigate and recover the remaining stolen goods. Judge Wu Zehan briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody separately, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Shen Mingming, a local resident of a bungalow with no number on Ninghe Road, Yangshupu, was around 70 years old and a local bailiff with a well-to-do family. Recently, the Narcotics Department detective Xu Guirong discovered that he was selling red pills. Xu reported this to the foreign detective chief Bai Pu, who, on the morning before yesterday at about 10:00 AM, took a court search warrant and secretly went to arrest Shen at his residence. They found a "double horn" mark on his person, a sign used by informants to buy pills. In an old basket of clothes on a long bench under the eaves of the house, they found four packets of red pills, estimated to be several thousand. In the bedroom, they found an opium lamp. They took everything to the Yangshupu Police Station, and the captain ordered them to be detained. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The Public Works Bureau lawyer Wang Yuetang stated that on the 16th and 17th of this month, Detective Xu sent informants to the defendant's residence, buying two small packets of pills for two jiao each time. The third time, he used a foreign knife to mark a "double horn" on a coin as a secret sign, then bought another small packet. Chinese and foreign detectives then entered the house and arrested Shen. He is now being prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. The seized evidence included a "double horn" coin, seven packets of red pills of various sizes, and an opium lamp. Chinese and foreign detectives then reported the details of the arrest. When questioned, the defendant said he never sold red pills, had known Detective Xu for years, and claimed Xu framed him because of a past grievance. Shen alleged that Xu sent a henchman to invite him out for tea twice that morning, but he declined. While Shen was absent, Xu secretly put the red pills in the basket. Shen also claimed the "double horn" mark found on his person was stuffed into his pocket during the arrest and that the opium lamp was from a past illness. Shen stated he would rather be shot than admit to selling red pills. Detective Xu denied the defendant's claims. Wu Sijin, a Suzhou woman and Shen's tenant of over ten years, testified that he did not sell red pills. Zhang Defa, a Haizhou native and police informant, testified that he had bought small packets of red pills from Shen three times for two jiao each, and that Shen personally delivered them to him. Judge Xiao Xiefen, considering the evidence conclusive, sentenced Shen Mingming to two years' imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan. The evidence was confiscated. The defendant's lawyer appealed and requested bail, but the court rejected the guarantee offered by dozens of neighboring shopkeepers and ordered Shen to remain in custody.</p>

<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun of the 18th, the recent issues of students frequenting dance halls and the mahjong gambling incidents involving students from Tokyo University and Keio University are on the rise. The disruption of school discipline has become a problem among informed people. Surprisingly, students from Rikkyo University, an institution known for its exceptional reputation and operated by a missionary group, have been continuously gambling at mahjong in classrooms. The hidden secrets within are particularly alarming. More than 20 students, including Shiro Yamagishi, often used chips instead of cash (five or ten sen). Since February of this year, they have taken advantage of teachers' absences or breaks to gamble wildly at mahjong in classrooms. Classmates kept watch outside the door to prevent anyone from finding out. As a result, not only was the content unknown to outsiders, but it was also difficult for school authorities to discover their secret. Later, as time passed, a thug named Takagi, whose younger brother was also a thug, began visiting the school from late April, insisting on meeting with these students. He threatened them, demanding twenty yuan per person as a "longevity fee," or he would report them to the police. Takagi extorted several hundred yuan in blackmail money. However, feeling increasingly unsafe, he fled into hiding. As a result, the truth of the case gradually came to light.</p>

<p>The Anhui Construction Department established the Huangshan Construction Committee in the spring to develop the scenic area of Huangshan in southern Anhui. It hired Xu Shiying, Yang Hu, Hu Pu'an, Jiang Tonghou, Gao Yihan, Jin Weinong, Guan Yunong, Huang Binhong, Huang Bodu, Yu Yumin, and other gentlemen as committee members. The plan was to build a branch road from the end of the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway directly to the foot of Huangshan. The committee members and Huizhou gentry and merchants are also designing plans to lease land on the mountainside to build houses. Xu Shiying, Jin Weinong, and Huang Bodu traveled from Shanghai on the 19th to inspect the area. On the 20th, they arrived in Shexian, where they were welcomed by Liu Bingcui, the Tenth District Administrative Inspector, Magistrate Shi of Shexian County, and various public organizations. They agreed to first repair the mountain road, and Xu immediately donated 1,000 yuan from relief funds to use the project for labor relief. Afterwards, there was a public banquet at Ruyi Temple, and they stayed overnight in Tangmo. On the 21st, they hiked sixty li and stopped at Yangcun. On the 22nd, the group encountered Mr. Wu Zhihui on the way and arrived at Tangkou, where they bathed in the natural hot springs. That day, they arrived at Ziyun Nunnery. The preliminary plan was to visit Ciguang Temple on the mountain on the 23rd, Wenshu Temple on the 24th, Shizilin on the 25th, and Yunyu Temple on the 26th. All of these locations are on Huangshan Mountain. On the 27th, they will visit Baiyue, on the 28th, they will go to Xiuning County, on the 29th, they will go to Tunxi, and on the 30th, they will leave Huizhou and return to Shanghai. Also traveling with them were Shanghai-based Anhui gentlemen Mr. Wang Delin, and three gentlemen from the Relief Committee: Zhou Xusheng, Hu Zhongshu, and Hong Yulin, as well as Xu's third son, Gongpu, sixth son, Gongshi, and Mr. Zhou Liangxiang from the China Travel Service.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Both Railway Bureaus Act as Agents for Collecting MOGANSHAN Joint Transportation Vehicle and Sedan Chair Surcharges; Agreed-Upon Methods Extended for One Year <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The joint transportation vehicle and sedan chair surcharge collection method for Moganshan, previously agreed upon by the two Railway Bureaus with the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration and the Moganshan Management Office, generally stipulated that the Highway Administration and the Railway Bureau would act as agents for the Moganshan Management Bureau in collecting joint transportation passenger vehicle and sedan chair surcharges. The surcharge rates were: (A) Vehicle Surcharge: First, second, and third-class passengers, adults, were charged 2 jiao per person; children (age determined by railway regulations) were charged 1 jiao per person; (B) Sedan Chair Surcharge: Sedan chair carriers were charged 1 jiao per person. Those purchasing round-trip tickets were charged double the above rates. The effective period of this method was originally scheduled to end at the end of the 22nd year. The Railway Bureau intended to continue the method for another year after the expiration date and sent letters to the Railway Bureau for their agreement. The Railway Bureau believed that this agreement would be beneficial to the overall construction of the mountain and should be supported. However, the phrase "Railway Bureau by the Hangzhou Rolling Stock Section Chief" in Article 5 of the agreement should be changed to "Railway Bureau by the Hangzhou-Jiazhaba Rolling Stock Section Chief or the Moganshan Railway Hotel Manager" to comply with the Railway's current organizational structure. Furthermore, when railway employees travel from Hangzhou to Moganshan or from the mountain to Hangzhou, the Section Chief or Hotel Manager would provide a written certificate to exempt them from paying the vehicle and sedan chair surcharges. The matter has already been communicated and related departments have been instructed to comply.</p>

<p>Around noon the day before yesterday, a middle-aged man, speaking Cantonese and wearing a grey-blue silk spring gown and a grey felt hat, opened room number two in the Jiande Apartment at 737 North Sichuan Road. He was about thirty years old, with a haggard face and faltering steps. He claimed to be Li Dechen, a 29-year-old timber merchant from Guangdong. He paid a rent of two yuan. After the tea servant brought tea and water and left, he closed the door tightly. Around 5:00 PM, he opened the door and called the tea servant to buy him food. Around 7:00 PM in the evening, he ordered a bowl of noodles, ate it, and then closed the door and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, around midnight, there was a groaning sound in the room. The tea servants suspected something was wrong and rushed to knock on the door. After a long time with no response, they reported to the accounting office. They used a wooden ladder and a flashlight to look through the window and saw the guest lying stiffly in bed, motionless. Realizing something was wrong, they climbed in through the balcony, turned on the lights, and saw him foaming at the mouth, barely breathing. They reported to the first section of the fifth district and notified the fire brigade to dispatch a fire engine to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, he had taken too much poison and died at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning. The police station sent officers to investigate and reported to the court for an autopsy yesterday morning. Two suicide notes were found on the pillow, one addressed to the apartment, asking them to notify his friend Chen Rutian to handle the funeral. The other was addressed to Chen Rutian, stating, "Last night, I ate at Tan Manji and came out. I went to a Hongkou hotel to commit suicide by poisoning. Because I bought too little opium, only six jiao worth, I suffered all night and didn't die. Today, I took poison and bought one yuan worth of opium, which should kill me," signed Xie Xiushan. Therefore, the deceased's real name was Xie Xiushan. He had first attempted suicide by poisoning at a Hongkou hotel, and then moved to the Hongkou Apartment to try again. The reason for the suicide is unknown. A photo was found on the deceased, a photo of the deceased and a female companion, with the words "Please Chen Rutian publish this photo to invite someone to claim the body" on the back. The first section of the fifth district is investigating the person Chen Rutian, hoping to find the truth.</p>

<p>The Guanghua brand cigarettes produced by the China Huamei Tobacco Company, known as China's standard cigarettes, have been praised by the banking industry and have become popular in various places in less than two months due to their quality, price, decoration, and flavor, which are in line with the principles of promoting national cigarettes. Yesterday, Mayor Wu entertained more than a thousand Chinese and foreign celebrities with tea and various Chinese and Western cigarettes. The Chinese standard cigarette, Guanghua brand, stood out from the rest, showing a sense of outstanding uniqueness. The honor of the Chinese standard cigarette Guanghua brand is also the glory of the national cigarette industry.</p>

<p>Most of the machinery used in power plants across the country is imported, and a large amount of money flows out of the electrical industry every year. Recently, it has been reported that the Xin Dianjie Magazine, run by Deng Zian, has an electrical industry introduction department dedicated to promoting domestically-produced electrical machinery products. The magazine has been in Shanghai for more than two years and has many contacts with power plants and electrical experts across the country. Now, the introduction department, in order to promote the domestically-produced electrical transformers and other products manufactured by the Yizhong Foji Machinery and Porcelain Electrical Company, has Deng Zian send letters to power plants and electrical experts across the country, inviting them to jointly use domestic products. This can also be a good opportunity for those who manufacture electrical motors in China. The letter reads: "Respected Sirs, today, if China wants to become rich and strong, it must increase domestic production. Our country's electrical industry is growing, and the electrical machinery it needs is mostly purchased from overseas. The amount of money exported each year has reached more than ten million yuan. The electrical industry should find a way to prevent this huge outflow. Now that the whole country is promoting national products, each factory should adopt domestic products and concentrate on manufacturing. Domestic factories will be revitalized and the country will preserve its vitality. Transformers are needed in the electrical industry and those manufactured in China include the Shanghai Yizhong Foji Machinery and Porcelain Electrical Company, which specializes in manufacturing transformers, current limiting tables, and various electrical porcelain materials. The company has been established for nearly fifteen years, and those in charge are mostly technical experts. The products they produce have been praised by all the power plants that have used them, and the prices are lower than those of imported products. Domestic products can already replace foreign products in electrical machinery. We hope that domestic electrical factories will promote and use these transformers as much as possible, and those who have not used them should try to use them in order to show the glory of domestic products, increase the country's wealth, and encourage manufacturers to move forward. We believe that you are enthusiastic about the national electrical industry and will not lag behind our company. We must work together as soon as possible to achieve self-sufficiency. If your factory wants to try this transformer, you can contact the company directly (110 Hankou Road, Shanghai) for details. If it is inconvenient to inquire directly, our introduction department can handle everything for you. In the spirit of promoting national products, we hereby send you this letter.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal History Museum, with the spirit of working hard together, is engaged in the compilation of the city's general history. In order to solicit advice from scholars and public criticism, it has printed several drafts on a quarterly basis and published a periodical to distribute to all sectors. Not only is the museum's work specifically demonstrated by the periodical, but also its attitude of painstaking research and lack of perfunctoriness are also spread to the academic community. In a very short period of time, the world has not only been able to anticipate that the Shanghai Municipal History will open a new era in China's local history, but it has also confirmed that the museum is one of China's important academic institutions. However, due to financial constraints, the museum's periodicals have a very limited print run and have not been distributed widely. The museum is very sorry that it cannot meet the demands of those who have repeatedly requested them. The museum has now taken advantage of the publication of the periodical for a full year to re-examine it in detail and reprint 300 copies, which are compiled into a book to meet the needs. The compilation contains a total of more than 1,100 years and about 700,000 words. All departments of Shanghai, including the origin of the city, the public concession, the French concession, diplomacy, finance, academic arts, industry, and social undertakings, have historical records ranging from tens of thousands to more than one hundred thousand words. It is an essential resource for those interested in studying Shanghai and understanding the important history of China in the last hundred years. The compilation costs five yuan per book, plus one yuan for postage for other places. Those who need it can contact the museum directly at 291 Saposai Road, Shanghai, to purchase it to avoid missing the opportunity again.</p>

<p>The electrical appliance industry is a type of scientific manufacturing industry. Twenty years ago, all electrical appliances needed in our country were imported, resulting in an annual loss of tens of millions [of currency]. Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the Asia Electric Appliance Factory in this city, has been diligently managing [the factory] for years, and the results have been remarkable. In addition to manufacturing domestic light bulbs, Mr. Hu opened a factory on Poyang Road in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China to manufacture various electric fans, electric clocks, and electric stoves. Since their introduction to the market, they have been highly praised by all sectors. Recently, with the arrival of summer, orders for electric fans from both local and out-of-town customers have been pouring in, making the factory even busier.</p>

<p>Car driver Gao Chunsheng, on March 22nd of this year, at approximately 9:00 AM, drove a privately-owned car with the license plate number 892 belonging to Russian doctor Mai Qi (transliteration) from Xiafei Road in the French Concession eastward to the tram stop at the intersection of Luban Road. Due to the driver's negligence, he struck Wang Mo (courtesy name Bingqing), a Shaoxing native who was the chief of the Document Section of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Department, causing his death. The French police department's traffic division arrested Gao and handed him over to the Second Special District Local Court for public prosecution. The victim's family also filed a civil suit, seeking damages of 30,000 yuan. The initial trial sentenced Gao to three years in prison and ordered him to compensate the victim's family with 5,000 foreign yuan. Gao, dissatisfied with the original verdict, appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The court held a hearing the other day. In the private prosecution part, a settlement was reached in court for 2,600 yuan, to be paid in three installments. The public prosecution part was declared closed, pending the pronouncement of the verdict. The above situation has been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, Judge Guo, together with Assessors Sun and Fan, held a hearing and announced the verdict. The main text of the original judgment was revoked, and Gao Chunsheng was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for causing death due to negligence in his business. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day, which is half of the original sentence. It is reported that Gao still expressed dissatisfaction and intended to appeal to the Supreme Court for a third trial, hoping to escape punishment.</p>

<p>The Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center has been making tireless contributions to publishing. Now, the first research report of the center, "China's Rural Movement Today," has been published. The book was written by Kong Xuexiong, a researcher at the center, and describes the rural movements in various parts of the country over the past ten years in great detail. The experimental movements in various places, such as Ding County, Zouping, and Zhenping, are all described in a detailed and analytical manner. The development of various rural construction theories, such as village governance theory, rural education, and local autonomy, is also discussed in a systematic manner. All the descriptions are based on actual investigations and are by no means empty talk. At a time when rural revitalization is being highly promoted, this book is the best reference material for both those who are engaged in practical work in the countryside and researchers of rural issues. The content includes a general discussion of the meaning and conditions of the rural movement, rural construction in Shandong, the Ding County experiment of the China Association for Promoting Mass Education, rural improvement projects and mass education in Jiangsu, the Zhenping militia and autonomy in the bandit areas, the rural credit cooperative business in Hebei, the movement from Xiaozhuang School to industrial study groups, and the Xiaoshan Eastern Township autonomy under Party-led administration. All of these are extremely brilliant. Finally, it summarizes the gains and losses of the work in various places and his personal opinions. The general trend of the rural reconstruction movement in China in recent years, as well as those that can be called representative works, are roughly covered without omission. In addition, there is a preface by Mr. Sun Zhesheng and three appendices, including a survey of the national rural improvement business and a list of rural activists, which are also relatively complete. The entire book has more than 240,000 words, bound in a thick volume, and is priced at 1.50 yuan. It is sold at major bookstores such as the Commercial Press, the Author's Bookstore, and the Modern Bookstore. The issuing office is the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center on Fuxu Road in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The "Jing'an" steamer of the Sanbei Steamboat Company, which operates on the Shanghai-Hankou route, has been detained for more than 40 days since Yu Shicheng accused it of sinking a Fuzhou small steamer and requested the court to seize it, resulting in huge losses. Furthermore, Yu Qiaqing, the manager of the company, believes that the sinking of the Fuzhou small steamer was not caused by the "Jing'an" steamer at all. The Shanghai Maritime Administration's Ship Collision Dispute Handling Committee conducted a detailed investigation of the case, summoned witnesses and evidence, and determined that it was not the "Jing'an" steamer that collided. Now, the private shipping companies, believing that the "Jing'an" steamer has been unjustly detained, are outraged and fear that everyone will be in danger in the future. They have decided to convene a meeting within the next few days to discuss petitioning the government for its release, and they will not stop until their goal is achieved.</p>

<p>Zhang Shunsheng from Changzhou opened a workshop for manufacturing rubber stamps and ox horn handles at No. 100 Ziyou Lane, Guangdong Road. Zhang Bingqing also opened the Yongxing Bookstore on Wangping Street. In the past, due to business competition, they had invited their colleagues to discuss and unify the price, with each ox horn handle priced at 1.2 jiao foreign currency, and no discounts were allowed. However, Zhang Shunsheng recently suddenly reduced the price to 7.7 li, which is 3.5 li less than the agreed-upon price. Zhang Bingqing learned of this and, at 8:20 PM last night, led his shop assistants Liu Xingsheng and Li Delin to Zhang Shunsheng's place to reason with him and invite him to a teahouse for judgment. Unexpectedly, Zhang Shunsheng, knowing that he was at fault, used a working chisel to stab Bingqing's thigh and both arms five times in a row, all the way through, immediately injuring him and causing him to fall to the ground. Liu Xingsheng immediately stepped forward to stop him and was also stabbed in the eyebrow and chest. At that time, Zhang Shunsheng knew that he had caused a disaster and begged Liu and Zhang not to report to the police, promising to send them to the hospital for treatment, with the medical expenses being borne by him. He then took Liu and Zhang to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital telegraphed the Laozha Police Station, and Detective Wang Yifei went to arrest Zhang Shunsheng and detain him in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and prosecuted him under Article 294 of the Criminal Law. According to Zhang Bingqing's statement of the situation at the time, he claimed, "I have fainted three times since being stabbed yesterday and the pain is unbearable." The defendant, when questioned, claimed that he was slapped in the face by the plaintiffs and his front teeth were loosened, causing him to become confused and cause this great disaster. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and sentenced Zhang Shunsheng to seven months of imprisonment for injuring someone using a method sufficient to cause serious injury.</p>

<p>Questions and Answers for Studying During the Day</p>
<h3 id="e198">Knowledge Required for Work: Reading Guidance... <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>I sincerely request some guidance from you for the knowledge required for my work.</p>
<p>My current position is equivalent to that of a librarian, but with a different title. Therefore, I would like to acquire some knowledge about "statistics," "classification," and "cataloging." I don't know if there are any books on these subjects? Which bookstore publishes them? Please give me a detailed answer, sir.</p>
<p>Also, in my spare time, I would like to study some printing technology. I don't know if there are any magazines or books in China that specialize in printing? Please indicate this as well, I would be very grateful!</p>
<p>丨Letter from Xu Zhusan丨</p>
<p>Knowledge required for work is the most practical knowledge. I think naturally Xu is not alone in needing such knowledge. Social guidance in this area has always been neglected. This column has rarely discussed such questions before, but it is not because we have not noticed it. It is because such ordinary questions are actually the most difficult to answer. Previously, we did not find people with expertise in many areas. For example, a varnish maker asked us some chemical questions, and we could not find anyone to answer them. Therefore, we often could not satisfy the readers' wishes. This time, Xu is asking about the knowledge of library science, which is akin to asking our own family.</p>
<p>However, before we discuss the knowledge of the practical questions related to the needs of the business, we must first understand what kind of department his work is in. What difficulties are encountered at the specific work? What are its specific contents and scope? If there is no boundary, our answer has no way to start.</p>
<p>It seems that Xu's question is rather vague, general, and abstract. Although he talked about "statistics," "classification," and "cataloging" and other issues, he did not point out any narrow range of these problems. Here, we can only write about the general library science theory to the best of our ability...</p>
<p>First, classification is the most cumbersome task in the library, and that is generally recognized. The meaning of book classification is generally to "put things of the same nature together". However, this sentence, at first glance, seems very clear in meaning, and there is no difficulty, but in fact, it is often the case that a book has to be listed in two or three or more categories. When encountering such divergence and ambiguity, it often takes a lot of time to think hard, so doing this work sometimes can really make people impatient, because you can't get the most appropriate category: but sometimes you will feel happy and interesting, although that's the way it is said, There are always principles and experiences to refer to in dealing with any matter. Let us mention three points as follows (1) Since there is no absolute scientific classification in book classification, then we can take theory as the basis on one hand, but take facts as the premise on the other hand. It is the combination and interpenetration of these two. The only thing we have to do is to make the books feel convenient to take and place in operation, then sacrificing a little theoretical law is possible. For example, in natural science, there is electricity and electrical engineering in applied technology, the former is about electricity in principle of natural science; the latter is about the technology of electrical engineering in applied technology, according to the theory, the two examples mentioned above should be given two categories, but if there are not many collections, at the same time, for the reference of a certain problem and to avoid scattering, it is also reasonable to summarize them in one category. (2) When determining the category of each book, try to take the highest meaning. For example, if there is a book about the "May 30th Incident", this book can be divided into the issue of Sino-Japanese and Sino-British diplomacy, and it can also be divided into modern Chinese history, but it is not as great as dividing it into the meaning of the Chinese national liberation and revolutionary movement. (3) The order of classification has a considerable significance, and this point should also be based on the laws of theory as much as possible. For example, if there are several books about the records of social thought history, it is necessary to consider the order of occurrence and not reverse the order.</p>
<p>The three items mentioned above belong to the general and important arguments of the classification method. At the same time, it is too short to write about the theory in this area here. It is impossible to list them in detail. As for the question of which method to use for classification, we generally agree with the Dewey Decimal System because of its flexibility. If the library is small and there are not many books, you only need to use the outline. If the scale is large and there are many books, you can use both the outline and the outline. If the outline is still not enough, you can add decimal points.</p>
<p>(2) Cataloging is a more complete work of the library after classification. If the library has a complete catalog, readers can use the catalog to guide them to retrieve the information they want in their hearts. However, this cataloging is a very practical work and must be understood through practice. Moreover, the cataloging depends entirely on the needs and complexity of the library to determine the work. Some libraries only produce a book title catalog. Some libraries also have author catalogs, title catalogs, classification catalogs, and even dictionary-style catalogs, but usually libraries have book title and author catalogs. As for the methods of cataloging, there are many rules that are difficult to list in fact. Fortunately, there are special books for introduction below, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of statistics, we also think that it is almost the same situation as cataloging, that is, how to count the materials generated in the business that Xu has put forward, which depends entirely on the actual needs. As for the principles and methods of statistics, the following books can be used as a reference.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding magazines and books specializing in printing, I have not heard of them in China. Recently, the Commercial Press Publishing Weekly has a column "Printing Knowledge" in Issue 75, which is also worth reading. Furthermore, today's newspaper reported that the library published a book on modern printing technology, priced at 4 jiao. We made a special trip to purchase and read it. It is said that it is still their first work. This little thing may slightly fill your desire for printing knowledge in case.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Group Performance <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the conference. There were 35 sections in the gymnastics program. Among them, the Nanqu Elementary School's "Expression Exercise to Save the Country from Disaster" was deeply meaningful. The Boy Scout flag language exercise of Yucai Elementary School was neat and skilled. The fitness dance of Daozhong Elementary School Attached School was lively and delightful. The Eight-Section Brocade of Jingqin Elementary School was full of spirit. In particular, the deaf-mute exercise of the deaf-mute school attached to Qunxuehui was neat in action, just like ordinary people, and was most appreciated by the audience. Other achievements, such as Chenjing's clapping exercise, Qilu's imitation exercise, Kaiming's dumbbell exercise, and Dunhua's three-collection boxing, were also very good.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Competition Overview <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲ In the Men's Group A 200-meter race, after Zhu Hongqi achieved an excellent record of 11.5 seconds in the 100-meter final the previous day, it was generally expected that there would be remarkable results in yesterday's 100-meter race. Zhu Aixian was a step behind at the start, and Zhu Yimai of Shangwen showed a strong desire to win at the 100-meter mark. Zhu of Wanzhu also started to make his presence felt. In the end, Zhu Hongqi was able to break the finish line first, but the result was 25.8 seconds.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding the Men's Group A 800-meter race, those who discuss primary school physical education all advocate that track events should generally be limited to 400 meters for long-distance running. This is because young children have not fully developed their energy, vitality, and spirit. Among the participants in yesterday's 800-meter race, only the champion, Fu Yuanxiang of Shangwen, was able to cope. The rest all reached the finish line, but all looked exhausted and hoarse.</p>
<p>▲ The Men's 110-meter Low Hurdles and He An's Gao Lian are naturally talented in this event. If they are allowed to dedicate themselves to training, they have a promising future. Observing the grace of their hurdle-crossing posture and the sprint at the finish line, they resemble seasoned scholars. Shen Ruixin of Shangwen had the imposing presence of Cheng Jinguan at the start, but unfortunately, his stamina was weak. The result of 15.6 seconds was still decent.</p>
<p>▲ In the Men's Running Long Jump, Zhu Hongqi once again took the top spot, followed by Hua Zhi, who was also admirable in his prowess. The initial difference between the two was minimal. The current record for this event is 5.71 meters, and it is expected that with time, they will surely excel on the field.</p>
<p>▲ Men's Pole Vault Most of the time when Hong Gen cleared the bar in the pole vault, it was a rolling style, and the posture still needs correction. However, Guang Gong's, the fourth-place winner, the little black charcoal He Dongchun, although his result was not as good as the top three, he competed with others for the sixth, seventh, and eighth places, all on the third attempt, and finally secured fourth place, which was not easy. Although not perfect, he should not be ignored because of his small size.</p>
<p>Hong Gen's spirit of finally pushing off with the pole is commendable.</p>
<p>▲ In the Men's Group B and C 200-meter race, Su Longzhang of Wanzhu won the championship due to his ability to sprint. Although He An's He Genlong finished third, he still seemed to have ample room for improvement. Zheng Liangzhi and Tan Jihao are both promising young talents. Their efforts at the start and finish showed the spirit of adults.</p>
<p>▲ Men's 800-meter Relay Shangwen uniquely has many athletes suitable for the 200-meter race. Athletes like Zhu Aixian, Hu Shihua, and Shen Ruixin are all eager to compete. In the first leg, Wanzhu initially had an advantage, but in the second leg, they weakened significantly. By the time Zhu Hongqi reached the fourth leg, although he was known for his bravery, it was difficult to turn the tide.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Guangdong Champion in Ping Pong Xiangbin Cup; Jiande Absent from the Final <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The 7th Ping Pong Xiangbin Cup was held as scheduled last night at the Meifeng Ping Pong Room. The chairman of the cup competition staff association, considering the previous request for postponement of the final, which had a major impact, specifically sent letters to both Guangdong and Jiande teams, stating that if they were absent from the final, they would be dealt with according to Article 7, Item 9 of the cup competition rules, "withdrawal midway." Unexpectedly, three hours before the final, letters were received from both teams, requesting postponement of the match, the reason being a conflict with the Chinese team's preliminary selection time." (According to the so-called Chinese team preliminary selection, it is said to be in preparation for the "Far Eastern Sino-Japanese Ping Pong Competition" to be held next month). The association immediately replied, saying that all matters had been arranged long ago, and it was difficult to comply with the request for postponement. It also pointed out that now that the Far Eastern Games have been illegally dissolved, even the Sino-Japanese tennis exhibition match has been canceled, so why bother with this Ping Pong? Therefore, it hoped that they would still attend on time. When the final arrived, the Guangdong team, as expected, understood the greater good and attended in full, while the Jiande team, except for the team captain Lu Zhongqiu, was absent. Therefore, the referee Zhou Weixin announced that Jiande had forfeited, and the representative of the cup competition staff association explained the situation, stating that it should be treated as a withdrawal midway. All of their competition results in this session will be canceled. As a result, this year's championship was won by the Guangdong team. The runners-up were promoted in turn to be tied between the Tianma and Meifeng teams, and each was presented with a flag for encouragement. The awards were presented by Ms. Shi Shuming, and finally, everyone dispersed after enjoying a banquet of refreshments.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ping Pong Association previously decided to hold the Chinese team preliminary selection, starting on the evening of the 23rd of this month, to select talented players in preparation for the Sino-Japanese International Ping Pong Championship, which will be held in Shanghai, China, in early June. However, since the Far Eastern Games were destroyed by the Japanese, people throughout the country have been indignant. The Japanese side, in order to fulfill its long-cherished wish to participate in the so-called East Asian Amateur Sports Association illegally, used its ghost tricks, which are not worth the ridicule of discerning people. It is now understood that the association, in view of the Japanese side's unreasonable destruction of the Far Eastern Games, is deeply indignant and has decided to send a telegram to Japan rejecting the visit to Shanghai for the competition. As for the preliminary selection of the Chinese team, as it is an association matter that the association should handle, it will still be held as scheduled to assess the players' skills.</p>

<p>▲ Sports Performance…To Be Held Tonight</p>
<p>The Tenth Anniversary Celebration of the Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School in Jiangwan will feature a sports performance tonight (the 27th). The program is extensive, and the performances are novel. All the clothing and accessories are made by the school's students themselves, so preparations have been extremely busy in recent days. In addition, the school's performance will feature a variety of dances, so it will be held in the evening. Various colored lights have been installed in the school's track and field, and an archway has been built in front of the gate. The school also feared that it would be inconvenient for guests to travel back and forth late at night, so it contacted the China General Omnibus Company and obtained approval for Route 4 buses to run until 12:00 AM.</p>

Since its commencement on the 10th of last month, players were gradually eliminated, leaving only Huang Zhihan, Lu Fubao, and Zhou Rongsheng for the finals. The finals were held last night at the Weishui Fang dormitory, with veteran table tennis player Wu Maoqing specially invited as referee. Over a hundred guests attended, creating a grand occasion. The results saw newcomer Huang Zhihan defeat veteran Lu Fubao and two-time defending champion Zhou Rongsheng, to win this year's championship.

This proposal was discussed at length, and ultimately passed as is, along with a revised draft of the organizational charter for experimental labor education zones under the Ministry of Industry. Other resolutions, such as establishing labor education implementation committees in industrially developed areas, petitioning the Ministries of Industry and Education to organize a committee for compiling labor education materials, petitioning the Ministries of Industry and Education to send responsible personnel to inspect, guide, and supervise designated experimental labor education zones, urging social education institutions in cities to focus on labor education and establish dedicated labor education implementation agencies, and editing and publishing labor songs, were also revised and passed.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Junior High School Student Drowns While Swimming at Provincial Nanjing Middle School <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Gao, a 19-year-old student in the A group of the third grade of junior high school at Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Middle School, a native of Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, went to exercise on the playground as usual after class at 4:00 PM on the 25th of this month. (The school's playground is outside the perimeter wall, which is very low and has recently been knocked down by outsiders, making it easy to cross.) When the self-study class started at 7:00 PM, the student was missing. While searching for him, Chen Ju and other students from Anhui Middle School reported to the school that Zhou Gao had been swimming in the swimming pool near the Jiulong Bridge outside Tongji Gate and suddenly disappeared. Upon hearing this, the junior high school director immediately instructed the resident tutor and class advisor Zhou Zhongchen, physical education teacher Li Kehang, and four other faculty members to rush to the scene. At the same time, they reported to the principal (at the first campus). After the class advisor and others arrived at Jiulong Bridge, they hired local security guard Wang Hong to find someone to dredge the pool. After about half an hour, they pulled the student ashore. His limbs were stiff and his abdomen was sunken. Li Kehang tried artificial respiration, but it was ineffective. They instructed the local security guard to watch the body and dispatched four school workers to guard the site. The principal, upon hearing the news, went to the second campus and sent someone with a letter to inform the student's parents in Xijiao Village, Chunhua Town, outside Tongji Gate. Three supervisors from the Provincial Department of Education happened to be in Nanjing for inspection and were staying at the second campus. They were informed of the situation and reported to the provincial supervisors, and also telegraphed the Department of Education. Separately, they reported to the 9th Police Substation and requested the Jiangning District Court to send personnel for an autopsy.</p>

<h3 id="e235">How Can Students Practice the New Life Movement? <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>"New Life, New Life." What a fashionable slogan. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to build the nation and revive the nation! To improve the knowledge and morality of the people! To make the general public's clothing, food, housing, and transportation orderly, clean, simple, and plain. In accordance with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame! It can be seen that the purpose of the New Life Movement is so significant! How important!</p>
<p>We students are the future masters of the country, and the responsibility of saving the country rests on our shoulders. We are the vanguard of practicing the New Life Movement, so we should understand how to practice the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>The most important ones are probably the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) Rules: We must abide by the rules as human beings, so there is also a rule in the New Life Movement's rules. When you see someone in the morning, you should say "Good morning." When parting, say "Goodbye." As the saying goes, "It doesn't cost anything to greet people, just roll your tongue." When eating, do not be rude. Walk on the left. There are many rules, too many to list.</p>
<p>(2) Cleanliness: Cleanliness is the key to longevity, so there is also a cleanliness rule in the New Life Movement. Clothes should be washed often, windows should be opened often, nails should be trimmed often, and hair should be combed often.</p>
<p>I think someone must say: "It is so difficult and troublesome to implement so many rules one by one." In fact, what is so difficult about this? Why be a person who is afraid of trouble? Just implement one or two rules every day, and in a month or two, you will have implemented the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Little friends, I think you are really not afraid of difficulties and troubles.</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Story of May <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Ding He</p>
<p>One evening in May, when Yingdi and Lanmei were fighting for a piece of cake, Dad came back from outside. When they saw Dad, they threw away the cake and went up to call Dad.</p>
<p>Dad just smiled at them and sat down on a chair next to them. Then, he asked them to sit aside and also asked me to sit aside.</p>
<p>Dad first opened his mouth and asked his younger brother what month it was now.</p>
<p>Yingdi quickly said "May." Dad then asked Lanmei, and Lanmei also quickly said "May." Dad asked me again.</p>
<p>"May is May, but we should call it National Humiliation Month."</p>
<p>After I finished speaking, Dad nodded and said, "Very correct." But Yingdi and Lanmei became strange. At this time, Dad sighed and said:</p>
<p>"Just remembering it, not thinking about washing away the humiliation, is no longer what we should do. You, not only do you not think about washing away the humiliation, but you don't even remember it."</p>
<p>So Yingdi and Lanmei cried. At this time, Dad laughed again and told them the story of May from beginning to end, in detail.</p>
<p>After Dad finished telling the story of May, Yingdi said: "We want to unite the children of China, rise up together to wash away the humiliation, rise up together to wash away the humiliation."</p>

<p>— Hu Yunwu</p>
<p>One day, hands and feet argued about who was more noble and lowly. The hand scolded the foot and said, "There is nothing more lowly than your 'foot' in the world. Why? First, your soles are always stepping on the ground, never seeing the light of day. Second, your appearance, 'foot', if you were to pick it up and show it to people, people would scold you for being ignorant." The foot laughed and said, "When I am dirty, isn't it your 'hand' that washes my feet? When you want to pick something up, if I refuse to move, can you pick it up?" The hand was questioned by the foot and was rendered speechless. The foot continued, "In the world, no matter what happens, there is no noble or lowly distinction. Each has its own use. We must help each other to be effective."</p>
<h3 id="e238">Animal Feet <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Little friends! It is very interesting to study various animals, big and small. Just looking at their 'feet', there are already all kinds of shapes and colors, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>Land animals all have feet. Some aquatic animals have feet that have turned into fins, and some have webbed feet. Why is this? Because land animals need feet to walk, and aquatic animals need fins or webs to swim. It's all because of adapting to the environment.</p>
<p>The feet of ferocious beasts have claws, which are convenient for tearing and eating other animals. The soles of their feet have thick flesh, so they make no noise when they walk, and they don't get hurt when they jump. The feet of carnivores such as tigers, leopards, cats, and lions are all like this. Clumsy beasts have hooves on their feet, some with double hooves and some with single hooves. Therefore, hoofed animals are divided into even-toed and odd-toed, such as elephants, cattle, sheep, etc., which are hoofed animals.</p>
<p>Birds are flying animals, with feet and claws. Insects all have six feet. Ducks are good at swimming, with webs growing in their feet, as are frogs. It's like a boat with oars. Fish's abdominal fins and pectoral fins are like oars, and the tail fin is like a rudder, which is really interesting.</p>
<p>Snakes, roundworms, pinworms, and hookworms have no feet, and they move entirely by the wriggling of their bodies. Frogs and deer have long hind legs and short forelegs, so they jump very fast. Crabs have eight feet, and giraffes, perhaps the 'kylin' mentioned by the ancients, have overly tall necks and all walk sideways. The front two feet of birds have turned into wings, so they can fly.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Cuckoo <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>

<p>Cuckoo! Cuckoo!</p>
<p>You crow in the air.</p>
<p>Tell us summer is here,</p>
<p>Golden wheat ears have grown,</p>
<p>Old farmers are grateful to you; for eliminating pests.</p>

<p>— Lin Ruan</p>
<p>Little friends, do you know the great British inventor Stevenson? The trains you see were invented by him. He was the son of a stoker at a coal mining company. When he was little, he only herded sheep for others. When he was fourteen, he started helping his father with work. But at the same time, he secretly studied. Later, his father died, and the whole family's clothes, poor things, depended on him alone. At that time, he also lost his wife, and his sadness was indescribable.</p>
<p>But Stevenson, who was not afraid of difficulties, started studying science regardless of whether he had the ability or not. The first time, he invented the safety lamp in the coal mine. The second time, he invented the railway, a powerful means of transportation. It was announced and performed on the road from Liverpool to Manchester, and the people watching cheered and wished him success, but in 1848, he died.</p>
<p>Little friends, a person who struggles, even if the environment is not good, cannot be stopped.</p>
<h3 id="e241">A Letter to Little City Friends <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zongjie</p>
<p>Dear Little Friends:</p>
<p>Your innocence, liveliness, and happiness are so enviable that I gave up the qualifications of a little old man - I am almost forty years old - and hang out with the children all day long, being the oldest old brother.</p>
<p>Little friends! I now live in the countryside, and can also be called an old brother from the countryside. What are some of the scenes and colors in the countryside in early summer? What do we play? Let me report some to you.</p>
<p>The rice seedlings in the field are already two inches long, planted in rows. The rapeseed has formed seeds, and the peas have also formed fruits. A kind of small bird is calling, "Quickly cuckoo! Quickly cuckoo!" The strong young men in the neighborhood have begun to take off their shoes, roll up their sleeves, and go to work in the fields.</p>
<p>The little friends and I get up together at five o'clock in the morning, walking and jumping on the bank of the field. There is a little wet dew in the grass, and the sun in the east has also begun to show its crimson face. We look at the rice seedlings in the field, look at the tadpoles in the stream, and listen to the birds singing on the branches. After walking like this for an hour, we each go home for breakfast, to school, and to do work.</p>
<p>Dusk is our happiest time. A large, soft, green lawn is our playground and natural chair. Many children are kicking balls, racing, or high jumping on it. We pick many wildflowers and weave them into crowns for the winners to wear. When we are tired of playing, we lie on it, tell stories, sing mountain songs, until the sun sets in the west, and Mr. Toad, who shouts slogans, cackles and calls for the meeting to end, and we each go back.</p>
<p>Little friends! How do you feel about these simple reports? Are you willing to try this rural life? I warmly welcome you to join us and wish you happiness. Your old brother, Xu Zongjie, sends his regards.</p>
<h3 id="e242">What is the Earth Like? <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you know what the earth is like?</p>
<p>The shape of the earth is a sphere. To be more precise, its shape is like an orange. Little friends, if you don’t believe the earth is round, you can go to the seaside and look far at a ship coming from the front. We first see the ship's smokestack, and only later can we see the hull. If you think the earth is flat, we should see the hull and smokestack together. How can this phenomenon occur?</p>
<p>During a lunar eclipse, we can see a round shadow on the moon. This shadow is the shadow of the earth reflected onto the moon. The dark shadow is round, so of course the earth is also round.</p>
<p>Little friends may ask, if the earth is round and constantly moving, why don't we feel it at all? You can also catch an ant on a ball and spin the ball quickly, but the ant can still walk forward without feeling anything. This is because the ball is too big and the ant is too small. We are like many ants, but the earth is a very large ball.</p>
<h3 id="e243">About Grabbing Thirty <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huai</p>
<p>Little friends! Last time, this publication published a small game called "Grabbing Thirty." I think you've already played it. I want to ask you, after playing, what experience did you gain?</p>
<p>Little friends! I am now writing down the experiences of "Grabbing Thirty" here. Do you want to know?</p>
<p>Step 1: Within ten numbers, grab three, six, and nine.</p>
<p>Step 2: From ten to twenty, grab two, five, and eight.</p>
<p>Step 3: From twenty to thirty, grab one, four, and seven.</p>
<p>If you grab in this way, you are guaranteed to get thirty. If you don't believe it, try it!</p>
<h3 id="e244">Sending Eggs 丨Sensory Game丨 <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Whether a child's sensory perception is sensitive or not is indeed somewhat related to their innate physiology, but postnatal behavioral training is also very important. Even if a child is naturally dull and slow to perceive, if they are given very appropriate training, although they may not catch up to a gifted child, they can at least surpass children who have not received sensory training. The best training method is through games. This "Sending Eggs" game is one of the methods for training children's sensory sensitivity.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of people playing the game, but too few may reduce interest, and too many may make it difficult for the guesser, so five to ten people is the most suitable. The location of the game is also not limited; it can be indoors or outdoors. Before starting, first choose one person to be the "egg sender" and one person to be the "guesser." The remaining people put their hands behind their backs and stand against the wall. The guesser closes their eyes tightly and stands about ten steps away from the people standing against the wall. The egg sender prepares a small ball or stone to represent the egg. They can sing, "Mommy hen is sending eggs, who wants one? Who wants one?" While giving the egg to any child, they then say, "Sent it! Guess who got it, and I'll give it to you to eat!" The guesser then walks closer to the children standing against the wall, observes their faces, and guesses who received the egg. If they guess correctly, the receiver and the guesser switch roles. If they don't guess correctly, they guess again. If they don't guess correctly after three tries, they will be punished by singing a song or telling a story.

<p>— Da Qi</p>
<p>Magpies chirping bring good news, crows cawing foretell misfortune. This is a superstition. Magpies and crows are just birds; how can they know people's good or bad luck? However, some people know it's not to be relied upon, but when they hear a magpie chirping, they can't help but feel happy; when they hear a crow cawing, they can't help but feel disgusted. In fact, crows know to feed their parents, they are filial birds, not something terribly bad. People always curse them whenever they open their mouths. It's really unfair to them! However, the crow's caw is "wah, wah, wah," carrying a kind of sad sound, causing unpleasant feelings, making people somewhat unwilling to listen. If that crow is ignorant and nods its head at people, constantly cawing "wah, wah, wah," people will pick up stones and throw them to drive it away. Isn't this what we often see? Although magpies chirping aren't particularly good, they are comparatively more energetic and pleasing to the ear, so a few chirps don't matter, many chirps don't hurt, and they are always welcomed everywhere.</p>
<p>Little friends, from this, we can see that people's speech must also be proper. Writing has grammar, calligraphy has methods, painting has techniques. How can speaking not have methods? In ancient elementary schools, there was "etiquette of responding," which was the study of speaking. In the sage's school, there was "the subject of language," which also emphasized speaking. If speaking is improper, no matter how good your knowledge and character are, you will often invite resentment and jealousy whenever you speak, constantly bumping into walls, just like a crow, opening your mouth and causing people to despise you. How can you gain a foothold in society?</p>

<p>Umbrellas have existed since ancient times. They were a symbol of authority used by kings and nobles. In ancient Egyptian and Assyrian carvings, we can see a servant holding an umbrella behind a king or noble, indicating that he was a person of authority. Umbrellas spread from the above two places to Greece and Rome, but became tools for shielding from sunlight. However, in Eastern countries, umbrellas are still considered symbols of authority, such as in Siam, Malaya, and places like Ashanti and Abyssinia in Africa. In ancient China, umbrellas also had a solemn and noble meaning. But in modern times, they are only used as tools for avoiding rain and shielding from the sun, or as decorations for women, as in Japan and China.</p>

<h3 id="e250">On Nurseries and Public Childcare <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>Since the news of the establishment of "nurseries" in Shanghai, it has attracted general attention. In the supplement of this newspaper on May 13th, there was an article by Mr. Shi Shi, "On Nurseries and Public Childcare." It was against nurseries, generally saying: "Although the public childcare of children in European and American countries has been implemented and has achieved results, considering the current social situation, national economy, cultural level, and family concepts in our country, it is considered that there are still doubts about promoting public childcare for children." The reasons for opposing are roughly no more than two points: (1) Opposing women engaging in professions and neglecting childcare. (2) Doubts about the nature of public childcare for children itself.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, Mr. Shi Shi said: "The pursuit of professions by general women in China today is actually just selling short-term youth... After marriage, since society cannot retain suitable positions for mothers with children, then nurseries naturally lose the necessity of existence. Moreover, women have the natural duty of raising children. Raising children to make them physically and mentally healthy is serving society, and its value is better than being a vase in an organization or a living signboard in a commercial arena." The need for women to engage in professions, even if leaving aside doctrines and theories, only speaking of the current situation in China, due to years of imperialist aggression, the prevalence of internal strife, rural bankruptcy, and the recession of the market, middle-class and lower-class housewives have had no choice but to seek employment to make ends meet. As for women from upper-middle-class families, since they have already had the opportunity to receive education, and have knowledge and skills, naturally they also want to develop their instincts, engage in politics, academics, or other professions, to the best of their abilities. Therefore, women's pursuit of professions is an inevitable phenomenon in today's society. On the one hand, there are working women, and on the other hand, there is a need for childcare institutions. One side can concentrate on work, and the other side can provide mass education. Those who like to work, work; those who like to raise children, raise children. It can be said that there is a division of labor for individuals and cooperation for society. As for the so-called pursuing professions, which is merely selling short-term youth, it is truly a defamatory remark against working women. But we cannot deny that there are indeed many working women who give up their professions after marriage, or cannot continue to engage in professions. The former is a phenomenon of a society where there is too little porridge for too many monks, and the reasons for the latter are certainly varied, but it is also due to the lack of childcare institutions.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, Mr. Shi Shi believes that public childcare for children will destroy family relationships, so he says, "Children and families have an inseparable relationship. Children are the center of family happiness... Only children and grandchildren around the knees can constitute family harmony... Family is also a paradise for children. Parental love is the only food for children's lives, otherwise, it will be difficult to survive." Mr. Shi Shi is still yearning for that kind of feudalistic peaceful paradise of having children and grandchildren around the knees. In fact, in today's society, where affairs are increasingly complex and making a living is not easy, it is already impossible for middle-class and lower-class families to enjoy this leisurely family life. Moreover, nurseries are different from China's inherent infant asylums. The children raised in nurseries must still return home on time to reunite with their parents. As for whether the family is a paradise for children, it is actually questionable, and the facts tell us that Chinese families, in general, are hells for children. The rich do not know how to teach, do not know how to raise, only know how to spoil; the poor cannot even talk about raising. Moreover, Chinese children, because they are accustomed to family life and lack group cultivation, generally have a sand-like habit, which is half formed by family life. As for parental love, it is indeed spiritual food for children, but doting and selfish love || parents regard children as playthings, as private property || loving them is actually harming them, not only harming the children themselves, but also causing harm to society. The high mortality rate of Chinese children is unparalleled. There are certainly many reasons, but it is also due to not knowing how to teach, not knowing how to raise, and being caused by hunger and cold. In this situation, there is a need for public and more scientific methods of teaching and raising.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of fees, according to the general practice in advanced countries, it is mostly based on the income of the parents of young children and has nothing to do with the number of children.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Shi concluded by saying: "In fact, it only opens the door for licentious playboys, and the result may become the origin of illegitimate children and adulterous children." In recent years, the rampant flow of human desires has been a well-known fact. Then the proliferation of illegitimate children and adulterous children may be an inevitable phenomenon. This bad phenomenon is a social disease. Illegitimate children or adulterous children are inherently innocent. Moreover, the Chinese nation was formerly 400 million, and now it may be less than that number. For the sake of revitalizing the nation, I believe that regardless of whether they are illegitimate children or legitimate children, it is necessary to find ways to make them grow up healthy. Therefore, I am glad that Shanghai will soon have nurseries appearing, and I hope that more and more will be established in cities and towns. However, I hope that those who run nurseries will strive for scientific management, avoid being aristocratic, and, even more, hope to open the door to convenience for poor children.</p>

<p>VII. Robert Owen</p>
<p>Robert Owen was a great Utopian thinker from England, born in 1771 and died in 1858. During this time, the progress of technology in British production had turned a large number of skilled artisans into appendages of machines, or completely excluded them from production and replaced them with unskilled, weak women and children. This was the period of capitalism's "rampant evils." Whole batches of young children died due to being cruelly exploited in factories. Owen was born in this era and witnessed all kinds of tragedies, which turned him from a great industrialist and humanitarian into a thorough social reformer.</p>
<p>The scope of his social reforms was very broad, including protecting children, running education, establishing schools, establishing nurseries, protecting factory labor, opening hospitals, and providing relief to the elderly and the unemployed. In order to realize his ideals, Owen attempted to establish a kind of communist commune to replace the old, dying system. But he did not understand that the economic emancipation of labor and liberation from slavery must be the responsibility of labor itself. Owen believed that "wise and far-sighted people" from all parties could jointly realize the necessary reforms.</p>
<p>When Owen was ten years old, his father sent him to work as an apprentice in a shop in the countryside. Later, he worked for several years in the two major cities of London and Manchester. In 1790, Owen, at the age of nineteen, became the manager of a large yarn factory in Manchester (which was then the center of the British textile industry). Seven years later, he and his friends jointly bought a yarn factory in New Lanark, Scotland, for 1.25 million marks, with 3,000 male and female workers and children. This factory became his laboratory for social reform plans.</p>
<p>Owen's first task was to pay attention to children. He set up many nurseries to accommodate children over six months old, in order to alleviate the suffering of female workers with children. He abolished the methods of rewarding and punishing children in the schools he ran; his factories also did not employ children under the age of ten; those over ten years old were required to work for twelve and a half hours, which was a huge step forward at the time, because even a four-year-old child had to work for twelve to sixteen hours in a factory at that time.</p>
<p>In 1825, in order to realize his ideal of a new social system, Owen purchased a piece of land in Indiana, USA, and established a communist community called "New Harmony." Owen had many outstanding male and female comrades-in-arms here, among whom a Ms. Blight played a particularly important role in the women's movement. She personally established a small group within "New Harmony." After the failure of the experiment at "New Harmony," Ms. Blight continued to fight for many years to win equal rights for women.</p>
<p>Owen believed that women were born equal to men and had no obligation to obey men. He also bravely put his beliefs into practice in life, although this caused violent attacks on him by society, he remained unyielding. In "New Harmony," women enjoyed the right to vote and be elected. In the "Young America" magazine run by his son, he published his twelve demands, one of which was "men and women should be completely equal."</p>
<p>Owen deeply believed in the power of the highest ideals of mankind. He attempted to create an example of a new, more perfect, collective social life system to counter the brutal exploitation of the time. In every aspect, he revealed a wealth of thought, which was the object of ridicule and sarcasm at the time, and now it has become the treasure of international socialism.</p>
<p>As for Owen's opinions on marriage, prostitution, women's occupations, and children's education, I will discuss them next time.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Alluring Mannerisms and Women's Liberation <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Jiong</p>
<p>Recently, a movement of alluring mannerisms for women is being promoted in Cleveland, USA.</p>
<p>It is said that the rise of this movement of alluring mannerisms is based on pleasing men. Because men feel that women who wear makeup are simply vases, soulless and only for people to admire. This not only fails to produce lively postures, but also has adverse effects on health. How can it "please the noble?" Therefore, they, standing from the perspective of pleasing men, found: (1) Because the number of women with lung disease is increasing day by day, it is not easy to cure disease and prolong life without promoting the movement of alluring mannerisms. (2) Displaying alluring mannerisms is also an opportunity for women to exercise their bodies, making them healthier day by day, and making it impossible for illnesses to invade. (3) It is not considered beauty for women to decorate their faces with cosmetics. It is only with charming postures that they are fully beautiful. (4) One must work hard on alluring mannerisms to be pursued by men everywhere. For these reasons, the movement of alluring mannerisms was launched: lectures are held everywhere, slogans are posted, and even various women's organizations have established specialized schools for the study of alluring mannerisms, teaching how to be alluring to men, how to be alluring to lovers, how to be alluring to husbands, as well as the alluring mannerisms of narration, love, greetings, farewells, and walking, so that they become experts in pleasing men before stopping. Can it be said that this can contribute to the women's liberation movement?</p>
<p>We know that the reason why women are in a position of oppression is due to social systems and economic conditions. This can be understood by simply flipping through the history of social evolution and the history of the women's liberation movement. And the American women, after being addicted to the taste of makeup, are coming up with a new trick: they mistakenly believe that by working hard on alluring mannerisms and being pursued by men everywhere, showing their health and arrogance, they are liberated (?). This is simply a self-deceiving joke!</p>
<p>If we believe that things from the West are always "modern" and learn this alluring mannerism, then our 200 million women under double oppression will be disarming themselves and abolishing the battlefront for demanding liberation. Because this kind of alluring mannerism movement presents us with a posture of pleasing men. It is a huge rock blocking the future of the women's liberation movement. It is a cup of anesthetic soup. Therefore, we should resolutely prevent the intrusion of this alluring mannerism movement and strengthen our women's movement front, strive hard from the economic and political aspects, and then we can obtain true liberation!</p>
<h3 id="e253">Do You Believe It? Twins Can Actually Have Two Fathers <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Not long ago, a strange case of twins being able to have two fathers, which shocked society, occurred in South Dakota, USA, and the local court also set a new precedent that had never existed in the world for this matter. Readers, do you believe it? This is really true, because in the village of Pullman in that state, there was a farmer named Yadva Bard, who had two identical twins, one of whom had a face very similar to Bard, while the other one was not like Bard at all. Therefore, Bard was very suspicious. Also, because his wife had committed adultery with someone else, Bard obtained evidence, and thus the dispute began. Bard said: He can only fulfill his father's obligation to his own child (that is, the one with the similar face), as for the other one, it is definitely not his child and can only be the responsibility of the mother. As a result, the couple took it to the state court. Naturally, Bard's reasons were very sufficient. After several interrogations by the court, Judge Dully Berger finally ruled to grant Bard's request, with the husband and wife sharing the support of the two children. According to this, twins can really have two fathers, can't they?</p>

<p>— Jue</p>
<p>"You are wrong!"</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>In the tenth issue of Women's Garden, your sad history was published. At the end, you said, "Who is willing to say to me, 'You are right,' or 'You are wrong'?" According to my use of all my superficial knowledge to "criticize" (?), I dare to say with certainty: "You are wrong!"</p>
<p>Please don't doubt that I am speaking against my conscience. In defending my gender.</p>
<p>First: I feel that when you were just starting to love each other, you certainly had to use all your abilities to observe your object. Aren't newspapers and magazines now full of news of marital deception? Can you suddenly believe that your object will not be the protagonist in those news stories? Looking closely at your "A Woman's Heart," you don't seem to have noticed this point at all.</p>
<p>Second: Since you knew that not long before you fell in love, he had been passionately in love with another woman, you should have inquired into why he broke up with his first lover and how he broke up with his first lover. Of course, he would use deceptive and improper means to break away from you, and his means of breaking away from his first lover must also be none other than deception or other improper methods. But according to you, you knew that "it is said that she refused to agree to his request, and then they broke up."</p>
<p>He would break up with his first lover because she did not agree to his certain request. Can you guarantee that he would not break up with you because you did not agree to his request to love another woman?</p>
<p>Third: Since your good friend warned you, "Can you believe that he will not go on to passionately love a third woman?" Why did you suddenly believe him? He would smash the precious lute given to him by his teacher, which means that he is a fellow who is good at forgetting friends. People who write blood letters are often the people with the weakest will. People who use death to threaten are also the worst dregs of humanity. You cannot be moved by his blood letter; you cannot abandon your doubts and hesitation for his "death." Death! Don't you know that many compatriots in the Northeast were brutally killed by the violent Japanese? Don't you know that many compatriots in the Northwest were drowned and starved to death by natural disasters? Don't you know that many commoners with round heads and square feet were shot to death by warlords? What is so great about the death of a person who would smash the precious lute given to him by his teacher in order to deceive the love of a member of the opposite sex!</p>
<p>Also, fourth: You cannot hate why your heart is not "ruthless" and not "poisonous." Your failure is not due to your heart being not "ruthless" and not "poisonous," but due to your brain lacking rationality! Your heart is too easily moved.</p>
<p>With these four points, I dare say that you are wrong. But, sir, you are from Hunan. People from Hunan and people from Guangdong are both the most courageous people in our country, the most enterprising people, the most revolutionary people, and the most hopeful people. I respectfully wish you to be able to use the blood of us Hunan people to break through the vastness of your future!</p>

<p>— Meng Kai</p>
<p>I am not a boarder at the school. Therefore, I wouldn't know about those novel things happening in the east and west dormitories. This is just about what I see during daily extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>We rarely have the chance to chat idly because as soon as the dismissal bell rings, everyone is busy picking up their bags and going home. So, it's rare unless there are no classes or the teacher is absent that</p>
<p>People's personalities are different, so their actions are obviously very different: diligent students, holding the motto "an inch of time is an inch of gold," bury themselves in their studies, but there are only one or two in the whole grade. Some active students happily skip rope and play basketball on the playground, fully expressing their liveliness and innocence. Students obsessed with movies and Cantonese opera gather to chat: "What's showing today is the XX movie, starring the newly selected queen... It's a pity I don't have a chance to see it... That star is so pretty and charming. Chen Fei Nong's acting is just right... Chen Zhao Hong is so beautiful... Liang Shao Ping is so fat... The male actors' performance yesterday was so good</p>
<p>, you must see it," they often chat away with great interest and lots of voices. Students who love to dress up always talk about the new fashions of 1934 and how to dress up... Today to Guang Han Palace, Da Guang Ming... electric perm... lover... a walk in the park... etc. There are many more that I can't remember. Some students with literary interests often play the old tune of life's grayness... As for me, I can't speak, and there's nothing to say. When I encounter this kind of scene, I just quietly listen to their gossip, or take the opportunity to observe their personalities. So I often sigh, "Alas! Today's female students are mostly immersed in daydreams, except for clothing, food, housing, reading, and entertainment. What do social affairs have to do with them?"</p>
<h3 id="e256">Smoke Screen <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>Youth, tenderness, and laughter.</p>
<p>These are all covered in front of a hollow and heavy curtain, behind which hides a ferocious and man-eating jackal, and the curtain pullers are some stupid lackeys.</p>
<p>With insatiable bloodthirsty mouths waiting for the students' dollars, imparting some smokescreen knowledge and flattering skills, telling you to say one and you cannot say two, telling you to be calm, even coughing is superfluous. If you obediently wag your tail, you might see a smile on the tiger's face. If you go crazy and want to take a breath and take a further step, good:</p>
<p>"Whack!" A whip will lash at you, a stern warning.</p>
<p>After the whip-like lecture, they will force you to participate in the provincial sports meet, write a eulogy for the school board, submit articles to the "××××" essay contest. Why? To please their masters. In front of the masters, they themselves are transformed into slaves.</p>
<p>Foreign teachers are hosting a party, so the girls are dressed up colorfully to be guests. Of course, a few fluent sentences of conversation will not be out of place, but usually, it is not allowed to run outside, stop at the triple gate, and you cannot leave the main gate more than six times in half a year. What is feared is that wandering around will distract you from your studies, and on the other hand, they are trying to promote school familiarization and socialization: sending invitations to parents to view the spring scenery on campus. Thinking about their daughters and sisters growing up in this good environment, the parents smile contentedly, and they cannot help but praise: a good place to cultivate emotions and character.</p>
<p>It seems that "general trend" has led the students to establish an autonomous association, which is approved by the school and supervises the executive committee and the general assembly. The selection of people is the focus of concern: those who are quiet and obedient, those who talk too much at meetings are troublemakers, especially the "smart people who still have leftover or unmailed donations."</p>
<p>Learning some waltzes or foxtrots in physical education is just the year for dancing to save the country! Twisting your waist, with fluffy, wave-like hair, and the pleasant sound of clattering leather shoes, the girls loosely feel the mysteries of spring.</p>
<p>Only the clever lesson locks the students' spring mood. Monthly exams, major exams, plus the graduation entrance exam. You have to gnaw on it, otherwise the school has the right not to allow you to participate in the entrance exam, fearing that bad grades will affect the school's overall average score. The authorities are always mindful of pleasing their masters.</p>
<p>Graduation is not easy. You have to send five hundred or one thousand commemorative gifts to the school and raise donations. However, the girls frown. Everyone knows that the economic downturn has affected families, and most families have been hit by this.</p>
<p>Musing blankly, sighing blankly:</p>
<p>"This world is a mystery. When will the fighting and闹ing end?"</p>
<p>Few can understand the cause and effect of this contradiction and terror. It is just that the sheep are really suffering from trembling disease, and this disease is spreading.</p>

<p>(1) Sir, Upon reviewing your newspaper's "Women's Enclosure" column on May 13, an article titled "Our School" mentioned that the school forbids reading "Cuore" and conducts virginity examinations, and generally referred to the authorities' oppression of students. At the end, there was an editor's note stating that this article was submitted by a student from Qingdao Municipal Girls' Middle School, and the author claimed responsibility, but questioned whether the content was fabricated. Please be aware of those in charge of education administration in the local area. Your newspaper's concern for girls' education is appreciated, but this article is not a faithful record. The language attacking the school authorities is very obvious, and the sections referring to the prohibition of reading "Cuore" and the virginity examination are especially untrue. We would like to inform your newspaper editor of the facts verified by our bureau. The school pays great attention to the physical and mental education of students. Therefore, the school stipulates that teachers and staff should regularly review students' extracurricular reading materials. Any books that are not suitable for the cultivation of young people's physical and mental health are advised not to be read by students. As for the book "Cuore," the school's library has always displayed it. How can there be a prohibition on reading it? Regarding physical examinations, as the editor said, the school regards it as a method of promoting students' health, so there are two types of examinations: disease examination and physical examination. The former is purely for examining diseases and is conducted by the school doctor, while the latter is mostly for examining the development of the body and is conducted by physical education teachers and staff from the Department of Student Affairs. This physical examination was conducted by three female teachers to examine whether the students' bodies had normal development and whether their clothing hindered hygiene, and there was absolutely no virginity examination. More than 300 students underwent the examination without any coercion. What the article said was exploiting the topic and sensationalizing, and it was not likely to have been written by a student of the school. However, since the submission claimed to take responsibility for the article, please (omission) grant a factual correction to clarify the truth and we look forward to your reply. The Qingdao Education Bureau, May 18, to the Shanghai Shenbao.</p>
<p>(2) Sir: I have just read the article "My School" in your newspaper's Women's Garden on May 13. It contains many insulting and slanderous words against our school, and it is said that it was submitted by a student of our school, which is very shocking. According to the rules, disease examinations are conducted every semester in our school. This semester, on March 5 (Health Week), in addition to inviting Dr. Jiao, the school doctor, to give a lecture on "Health Issues" during Memorial Week, disease examinations began in the afternoon after class. The school doctor was responsible for the examinations, and nurses from the Municipal Hospital and staff from the Department of Student Affairs assisted. The examinations were conducted on the ears, eyes, teeth, throat, and heart and lungs to see if there were any diseases, and the results were entered into the disease examination form item by item. The intention was to implement effective treatment or prevention based on the examination results to improve the students' health. On March 7, physical examinations were also conducted, and female physical education teachers were responsible. Staff from the Department of Student Affairs and female English teachers assisted in everything. The examinations were conducted on the posture of the head, shoulders, back, spine, abdomen, and feet, as well as the strength of the grip, and the results were entered into the physical examination form so that appropriate corrections could be made to obtain the correct posture. This work was completed within three weeks. As for the "virginity examination," not only had Mr. "never heard of it before,"</p>
<p>our school had never even thought about it, let alone implemented it! As for the sections prohibiting reading "Cuore," they are unfounded and ridiculous, and there is no need to explain them. Rumors stop with the wise. The so-called "although the content is questionable, the author claims responsibility, so let's disclose it" and "the aforementioned situation, if not fabricated" show that Mr. also suspects and speaks cautiously! However, rumors confuse the public and affect the reputation of the school, so our school cannot remain silent. We have specially described the facts and ask your publication to disclose a correction, (omission) To Mr. Han of the Women's Garden of the Shenbao, Qingdao Municipal Girls' Middle School, May 18.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Financial News: U.S. Treasury Secretary Decides to Levy Silver Profit Tax, Local Gold Market Still Calm; Opens Lower by One Cent in the Morning, Closes Higher by One Cent at Noon <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was extremely calm yesterday. There were few transactions in the first half of the day, and the market was idle. The U.S. Treasury Secretary decided to levy a tax on silver profits, and speculator Mr. Wu still had a buying appetite, which strongly supported the gold price. The foreign exchange market was still good, and the result was a slight increase compared to before. In the early morning, overseas silver markets were flat in England and up in the U.S. The forward silver price at the Gold and Silver Exchange was nearly flat and slightly higher in the long term. Exchange rates did not fluctuate much. London raw gold fell two and a half pence, U.S. cotton rose seven pounds, and U.S. wheat rose three-twelfths and five-thousandths, which seemed to be due to open lower. However, the Associated Press reported that U.S. government leaders today asked the House Ways and Means Committee to quickly pass the President's silver plan, and the Treasury Department advisor declared that the silver price would definitely increase based on the plan. However, the Treasury Secretary resolutely demanded that the 50% silver profit tax be retained. Although it lacked a huge impact, people's hearts were more stable. Reuters also reported that the U.S. Treasury Secretary described the executive branch's eagerness to retain the silver tax provision. Although it lacked a huge impact, people's hearts were more stable. The off-market opened flat and then slightly higher. After the opening, it rose due to the bank's appetite, but the supply was quite abundant. The foreign exchange market showed a slight illusion. The HSBC listing was revealed, and both England and the U.S. were flat. After entering, the market atmosphere was calm and there was a lot of hovering. Although low, it was still able to recover, because speculator Mr. Wu still came to buy. However, the fluctuations were extremely narrow. Later, the Seattle night market silver price did not move and shrank by one-twelfth and five-thousandths, which was just a roundabout situation and had little impact. Later, the domestic market slightly relaxed and large households sold slightly, once weaker, but the bank still picked up bargains, and the domestic market loosened and tightened again, so the gold price was firm again. The market was mediocre in the first half of the day. The price of pure gold was 1,029 yuan and 6 jiao, and the swap premium was 1 yuan. The situation in the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1,016 yuan and 6 jiao, slightly lower than the previous close by 1 jiao. Goods opened at 6 yuan and 5 jiao. The selling price of the recent British exchange rate in the morning was 1 shilling and 3 and a half pence, and the U.S. exchange rate was 32 yuan and 875. Zhengjin · McCallie sold September U.S. dollars at 325. Goods · Yongde advanced to 7 and a half yuan. Tongchun · Dadecheng · Shengda sold at 5 yuan and 3 jiao. Daxingyong · Huixiang · Hengxing and others accepted the goods, and speculator Mr. Wu made up his position, rising to 6 yuan and 4 jiao. Dadecheng · Yuqingyong sold off, falling to 5 yuan and 6 jiao. Hengchangyong · Fuxingyong still bought, and the HSBC listing remained unchanged. At this time, the situation circled and rose to 6 yuan and 7 jiao. Hengyu came to sell, and it fell to 5 and a half yuan, because the September U.S. dollar was 325, and the bank's appetite was different. Daxingyong still bought the goods, and Qianheng also had an appetite, still rising to 6 yuan and 6 jiao. Fu'an · Hengtai supplied the goods and the trend was mostly stagnant, and then Yifengyong sold vigorously, and Yuanshengyong also sold, falling to 4 yuan and 6 jiao. Chengkangyong · Hengyu · Daxingyong came in at low prices, September U.S. dollars 375, and the bank still had the intention to buy, gradually rising. Finally, Huabi · McCallie · North Korea all ate September U.S. dollars 3125, and Zhengchang worked hard to buy and the price rose, and the noon close rose to 1,016 yuan and 8 jiao. Goods closed at 7 yuan and 2 jiao. After the close, Zhengchang · Huixiang · Fuyu and others all advanced, rising to 7 and a half yuan. The highest price in the first half of the day was 1,017 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 1,014 yuan and 6 jiao, a fluctuation of 2 yuan and 9 jiao. The result was a slight increase of 1 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was that the HSBC Bank's U.S. dollar listing did not move and was still 32 yuan and 375. The standard gold price was 1,069 yuan, which was about 52 yuan based on the closing price, with not much difference from the previous close. The account price for June was 1,018 yuan, and for July was 1,017 yuan. The morning water supplement was 1,018 yuan. The price of pure gold was 1,029 yuan and 6 jiao. The market for boiled gold was quiet and there was no formal transaction. The Tianjin gang did not fall because the Shanghai price was not compatible. The Central Bank did not move yesterday because the price of gold bars was cheap, and the standard gold price did not fall, so it was difficult to make a deal. Swaps were only affixed by Qianchangxiang to Hengyu 670, only 2 yuan. There were still 3,360 strips of June notes left. Among the long positions, Hengyu had more than 900 strips, Dadecheng 770 strips, Qianchangxiang more than 500 strips, Huiyuan more than 200 strips, Qingfayong less than 200 strips, Yuanheng · Chunyuanyong · Fuxingyong · Yingfengheng each had more than 100, and the rest were scattered.

After that, the situation was extremely flat, but the September U.S. dollar was 33 yuan and 3125, and the bank's appetite was different, showing a slight relaxation. Although it once tended to harden at the end, it was entirely due to the influence of the gold market, and it soon returned to normal. At noon, the bank's appetite was still healthy and the trend was still tight. By the time of the noon close, the selling price of the recent British exchange rate was 1 shilling and 3 and a half pence, and the U.S. exchange rate was 32 yuan and 875, with little fluctuation compared to the previous close.

<h3 id="e261">Debt Market Extremely Dull Before Securities Settlement <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's futures for May had stopped. The market only traded futures for June for one month. The market atmosphere was unusually idle. On the one hand, only recent months were traded, and on the other hand, it was Saturday, and people's hearts were even more slack. There was no news in the environment. The trading floor in the morning was extremely deserted. The biggest drop was the reduction of troops by three jiao and a half, because the reduction of troops has always been heavily shorted. In the past two months, it has turned into a long position, which shows that the long positions are crowded. The opposite is true of the past, so the floating long positions are more, and the short side feels stable. The remaining varieties, such as the compiled legacy, the 19 customs 20 rolls, and the 20 customs, have not been traded, and the market price is also slightly weak. The second round of transactions was even more sparse, and there were six varieties that were not traded. The total trading time for the entire session was only more than ten minutes. Of the fourteen types of bonds, only twelve trading cards were bought and sold. The trading volume was so low that it was unprecedented. In the afternoon, the long side used the clear market to pull up the market price, and the trading volume increased slightly. The market price tended to be firm, rising by two or three jiao, and closing up by about one jiao. These were all unofficial market prices. The result of the market price was slightly better by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 and a half jiao. The reduction of troops and the 20 rolls were slightly smaller by 5 fen, 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was only 2,215,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e262">New York Stock Market Carried High by Wheat <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the stock market was carried high by wheat yesterday (25th), because it was predicted that the weather would still be arid within 24 hours, and the news came that wheat in South Dakota had lost 200 million yuan due to drought. The wheat price immediately soared. At the same time, it was also rumored that President Luo was about to issue a statement favorable to the long side, so the stock market also rose. The Federal Reserve report stated that gold reserves increased by 50 million yuan this week, reversing the previous three trends. Some Wall Street people deeply believe that before the United States restores the gold standard, the gold standard countries will refuse President Luo's silver plan to try again. The small exchange market conditions and bonds were mixed. According to agents, the market was mixed at the beginning, and then developed considerable strength. The closing was firm. The drought has not abated in wheat, and high prices are expected. The weather in Canada and the northwestern United States has not changed, and there is no relief in the short term. Some authorities have pointed out the possibility of inflation and the generally low estimate of the significance of the government's silver plan. With the progress of various markets, the cotton market has also been firm. Factory purchases this week totaled 189,000 bales. The urgent sales of rubber seem to be over, and the industry and brokers have bought in. There is not much foreign dumping. The silver market is calm, and speculators continue to forcibly close out. The total transaction volume for the day was 540,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>May 24 | May 25 | Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks | 93.37 | 94.50 | Up 1.15</p>

<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, but the overall situation is slightly softening. This is due to some long position holders taking profits and closing their positions, which has loosened the market. At the same time, actual demand is clearer than before. However, purchasing by merchants from Guangdong and inland provinces continues uninterrupted, so long position holders have no intention of releasing their holdings. With the cotton market still rising, the yarn market is not likely to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Standard Yarn Falls Back 90 Cents <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to favorable weather, but later firmed due to short covering and strong support from Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose 10 points, and futures prices rose 8 to 10 points. British cotton markets were closed. Indian cotton initially fell slightly due to long position liquidation, but rebounded due to purchases by Japanese merchants and short covering. As a result, Pingaal was unchanged, Oomra rose by half a rupee, and White Ropes fell by 7.5 rupees. Original telegram (dated the 25th).</p>

<p>New York, 25th: A report on the cotton market for the past week states that the development of the silver situation last week has disappointed inflationists. The cotton market loosened due to our long position liquidation, scattered selling, and good progress in new cotton growth. At the same time, the cotton goods market is sluggish, and the value of gold dollars is stable. However, it later rebounded slightly due to short covering. There is a lack of pressure from the South, but transaction volume has also decreased, so market fluctuations are very narrow. Sprouting of new cotton in the eastern part is slightly poor, but other areas are generally progressing well. It is now known that 90% to 95% of the new cotton has been planted, but opinions on the cotton fields cannot be realized until the end of June. It is necessary to wait for a complete decision on the planters' opposition to the Peng Hai Plan's allocation. Currently, market prices are fluctuating between strong spot positions, good new cotton growth, and poor cotton goods conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e273">Wheat Prices Unlikely to Rise Before New Grain Arrival <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market was generally flat. Although quoted prices for foreign wheat were high, rising by 90 cents to $1, the market no longer seemed to pay attention to foreign wheat prices. This is because, according to reports from various locations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the domestic new wheat crop is very abundant. Even in Henan and Shaanxi provinces, the current situation indicates a good harvest. Furthermore, foreign wheat and old wheat are sufficient until the new crop arrives. Even in the one or two months after the new crop arrives, there will be little need for wholesale purchases. With the market understanding this, price increases are unlikely. As a result, prices for July and August were unchanged, and prices for September were slightly lower by 1 cent. Spot wheat demand was low as factories had access to foreign wheat, so no transactions were reported.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Flour Market Remains Sluggish <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for all months showed a flat and sluggish trend. Quoted prices for foreign wheat rose by around 90 cents to $1 in Chicago, and by 90 cents in Canada. At the opening, the market was relatively stable due to high prices for foreign wheat. However, customer demand remained lackluster. Although the new wheat crop will arrive soon, the fear of oversupply persisted, and there was no urgent buying interest. Therefore, despite the rise in foreign wheat prices, it did not seem to have much impact, and the market remained sluggish. Transactions were even quieter in the afternoon session. Although small and medium-sized factories wanted to offer their inventory, few buyers were interested. After some haggling, prices stabilized slightly. As a result, prices for the current month were better by 5 li, prices for June, July, and August were better by 2.5 li, prices for September were better by 7.5 li, and prices for October were better by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Rice Market in Hexia Plunges 23 Cents <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, around 30 boats arrived from various suppliers (estimated at 4,000-5,000 piculs of rice). Initial sales were sluggish, and the market was weak. In addition, although stockpiled rice from the ports had been sharply discounted for days, sales remained slow, so the prices of stockpiled rice continued to fall by 5-6 cents, and fresh rice also fell by 3-4 cents. The situation for thick japonica rice was similar to that of late-season rice. However, the inventory in shops was relatively high, so even after a sharp drop in price, it was difficult to revitalize the market immediately. Because prices had already fallen significantly in previous days, they were able to stabilize slightly, with fresh rice only falling by a little over 2 cents, and stockpiled rice only falling by a little over 3 cents. Du Yang tip rice, relying on a lack of supply, was slightly weaker, and the price of Yin Bian Yuan was also constrained, with a soft undertone within the stability.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 28-29 boats arrived from various routes in Hexia, and there were more than 220 boats in the river inventory. Sales of various types of rice in the market, including white japonica, white yuan, early-season rice, thin rice, sheep Du tip, port tip, customer tip, were quiet, with total sales in the market being less than 1,500-1,600 piculs. Only the short-priced rice in bags moved slightly. The market for white japonica rice saw a decrease of a few cents for high-quality rice, and a reduction of 2-3 cents for mid- to low-quality rice. Short-priced rice in bags decreased by 3-4 cents, and transactions barely occurred. Prices for white yuan, early-season rice, and thin rice also decreased by about 2 cents. Prices for sheep Du, port, and customer varieties decreased by about 1 cent. The arrival and sales of Yin Yuan were balanced, but prices were also weak.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Customer Coarse Rice Continues to Decrease by 1.5 Cents <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica rice market saw both local and customer buyers taking a wait-and-see approach. The supply of rice continued uninterrupted, and the underlying inventory was abundant, so market sentiment was very weak. The prices of all types of rice fell across the board by a little over a cent. After the price fell, there were transactions of 1,000 bags of Hunan coarse rice from inland and Fuzhou buyers, with prices only at $6.55 to $6.50. Customer Yuan rice continued to arrive, and the market remained soft. Local streets and Ningbo inquired, and more than 500 bags were opened for sale, temporarily stabilizing the market. Hunan machine-milled Yuan rice was priced at $9.35, Jiangxi machine-milled Yuan rice was priced at $9.33-9.34, and there was little activity in other transactions. The market needs to rely on continued purchasing from local and customer buyers to reverse the trend, and it will not be easy to recover in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Hardware - Company Iron Sales Suddenly Boom <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Sales of Company Iron were sluggish and those in the business who had this good in stock were worried. Furthermore, foreign exchange rates were lax and the goal was to get rid of this stock quickly. Standards such as the old steel factory good was opening at $28.5 per crate and the new steel factory’s good was opening at $27.75 per crate, all of which was a setback of 5 cents to 1 yuan each compared to previously. Recently, various groups from Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou, and Zhenjiang have started purchasing. It’s estimated that the transaction volume had reached as many as 400-500 crates and there are still many people discussing and negotiating. Because of this, the trend is very optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e278">North-South Goods Daylily Stocks Running Low <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Because stocks of daylilies are running low and there is still time until new stocks come in, if sales are brisk, there is a true risk of running out of both new and existing goods. For this reason, spot prices and offers in Shanghai are all tight. Word is that stock in Zhenjiang is less than 100 crates. They plan to open for sale in 4 batches in order to progressively raise the price. Here, firm stocks are only 200-300 crates. As such, the spot price offered yesterday was already $24. Even if it wasn’t sold, based on how low the stocks are, it could really reach this price.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Silk and Tea - Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoon Harvest Is Abundant, Jiangsu Silkworms Lack Leaves <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>▲ In Hangzhou County, many local silkworms were hatched early this year in the villages surrounding the city. When the weather was cold and rainy at first, 60%-70% of the worms died. For this reason, late silkworms were raised to make up for it and the improved breed hatched later, but with good care, there were hardly any losses. After their long sleep, the weather was sunny and warm and the silkworms developed well. Early silkworm cocoons have already gone on the market and cocoon trading firms such as Jinglun have opened one after the other. Arrivals on the market are not abundant and there are more local silkworm cocoons which are lower quality. At first, cocoons were priced at $18 and the improved breed was at $20. The silkworm farmers were not happy to sell so cheap so the price all rose $4-5.</p>
<p>▲ Around Pingyao in places such as Jinjialong Village, there was not enough economic activity this year so many local silkworms were hatched. The weather wasn’t right and the worms’ resistance was poor and they were heavily damaged. Afterwards, improved breeds were raised and with effort, the results were okay. New cocoons are already on the market and the cocoons are on average just 50%-60% full. The improved silkworm breed’s cocoons are higher quality. Silkworm cocoons of the local breed are just $20-$24 whereas improved silkworm cocoons are $32-$33. The market is looking bullish.</p>
<p>▲ In the Chang’an improved silkworm area, most of the farmers raised improved breeds of silkworms. Even if the weather was cold, the influence was minor. The silkworms were late and developed best during their long sleep. Early and late silkworm cocoons successively entered the market and the cocoon trading firms have been open for four days. The receipt quantity is low. Silkworm cocoons of the local breed are $25-$26 whereas improved breed cocoons are $35. The silkworm farmers all must take a loss.</p>
<p>▲ Most farmers in the cities and villages surrounding Danyang raised the local breed of silkworms due to economic concerns. Because spring was cold and rainy, there was a lot of damage. Many of the silkworms had leaves dumped out and were replaced with improved breeds. After their second sleep, the weather was sunny and warm and the worms developed very well. The early ones had a vigorous long sleep and the late ones had just begun to sleep. Occasionally there would be those who were having their third sleep and beginning to leaf. Many mulberry trees in the surrounding villages have been dug up for firewood in recent years leading to a shortage of feed for the silkworms and there wasn’t enough supply to meet demand. Leaf prices had risen to over $2.</p>

<p>The overseas raw silk market has Japanese new silk on the market, Japanese silk merchants have started dumping new stock, and silk prices have become even more difficult to increase. Shanghai’s European and American firms are still thinking of depressing the price and hoarding new stock. It’s difficult to make progress in transactions. Yesterday, just British and French firms had a shortage of dry factory good and added more to stock. Jardine Matheson and other firms added 20 packs of White Factory good and Butterfield &amp; Swire added 10 packs of White Dry good. Prices remain firm.</p>

<p>The first batch of the Shanghai firm’s Tunxi Zhenmei Green Tea, head picking, new good, has for the most part arrived. British firms such as Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Tongfu are all very interested in importing this new good and transactions are brisk. In the opening offering, stem picking opened at $200 and average wholesale good opened at $132. The situation remained firm. Soil Good such as Zhenmei Needle, and Xia Mu from Suian and Wenzhou also had some sales. Butterfield &amp; Swire has started business for Qimen Black Tea, but there is not much in stock on the market and transactions remain sparse.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Wuyuan Tea Output Has an Acidic Harvest <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan Green Tea, the mountain farmer is already at the opening garden picking stage and has been manufacturing for one week. Appropriately, the weather has been good during this week. Dew falls in the mornings. The tea buds had been green and weak due to excess rain but after sun and dew, their taste deepened. The taste of the manufactured dried tea, the aroma, and the color were excellent, something unseen in recent years. The tea firms were delighted by this beautiful weather. As of today (the 17th), the tea leaves in the various villages had been picked and manufactured for the most part. The gardens are ready to be shut down in one week. But the tea from the shady side of the mountains and the tea from the plains was stunted because it had been frozen in the snow last winter and the mountain farmers reported bad harvests across the board. The overall total of tea produced across the county is estimated to be 30% lower than last year. The mountain farmers had been stuck with bad economics and bankruptcy for a long time and had been hoping for a good tea harvest to slightly increase their income. Now that it's like this, they can’t help but be depressed and disappointed. It is raining heavily today and the mountain farmers have stopped picking. Because the tea will soon have been picked, the firm is ready to go out to the farms to explore the prices. Looking at the state of things, it seems the mountain prices offered will be around $50.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Yixian Tea Output Has an Acidic Harvest <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Yixian is a district of Anhui known for tea with the most output. In places such as the eleven-and-a-half Capital, Yuanyuan, Zikeng, Kaoxi, Lucun, and Dongyuan, it’s been tea picking season for over a week, but because the climate in places such as Liyuan and Yuanyuan has been too cold, the tea buds have merely come out as green buds and have been hard to pick. With the weather warming in recent days and new tea from everywhere on the market, each mountain farmer is getting ready to open their gardens. According to the mountain farmers, the tea trees in each village were damaged by snow last winter and are growing poorly. The amount of output in the future will be estimated to be 70% of what it was in the past. But the tender shoots and quality of the tea produced are better than in the past. At the moment, in addition to the existing tea firms, Ggongxing and Tongyang have newly opened on Jicun Street and are preparing to do business. The market trend is booming.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Shaoxing Tea Industry Is Not Thriving <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Pingshui YaoGuo town in Shaoxing is close to mountain villages and is an important tea-producing area for Zhejiang province. The quantity exported is no less than Suichun. In 1918-1919, the mountain farmers there saw how the sales of disc tea were sluggish and business was difficult and were determined to remake the tea into banner tea to find a new way out. Whenever new tea entered the market, the tea merchants of Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou would all carry money to the production area to search for purchases. For over 10 years, business has been prosperous. But in recent years due to the influence of banditry and all kinds of taxes and fees levied again and again, buyers everywhere have not come one after another. And so business has not been thriving and has nearly fallen off a cliff. At the moment, tea firms in the area that purchase for customers have also lost money, and it’s hard to support them with the money they have left. Just one or two tea firms in the town are preparing to open this year. At the moment, it’s quiet and the scene is desolate.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Yushan Tea Market Revives <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>Yushan Green Tea in Jiangxi province had long relied on foreign firms as its greatest ally. Later, because of poor manufacturing methods, sales slowed as a result. Businessmen were ruined and customers stopped coming due to years of banditry. It was nearly as if there was no tea market to speak of for the past 5 years. Last year, just one firm in the county set up business and the decline had reached an extreme. Recently, the Red bandits in the county have been surrounded and wiped out by national armies and have gradually been pacified. Tea merchants in Chengcun Street, Xiaoyushan, and elsewhere saw that Shanghai valued cheap good and that the mountain price in the producing area was average. The good could be exported by means of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railroad and transportation was convenient. They all devised ways to restore their old business. In total, there are 9 tea firms opening business this year and it is estimated that another three or four firms are brewing preparations. The market scene is one of revival.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Qimen Black Tea Market Prices Trending Down <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Since Qimen Black Tea started opening scales and purchasing last month, the first good that was purchased was poor quality because the weather had been unceasingly rainy. The firm sought to protect its assets and bought in. Furthermore, production fell sharply and each firm’s purchasing quantity was extremely small. The most amount of head good that was made a pile was only a hundred crates and less than that was just fifty or sixty crates. The small crate amount was the least seen in decades. Even if the weather has become better this month and production has been more vigorous, the tea trees are growing unevenly and the tea could be done within days. Market prices have also not been constantly trending up and down. Every 100 catties started at an offered price of $48 which successively rose to $84 and $100. This week, it fell sharply to just over $30. Market prices are trending down every day. Every firm’s head crate of good has finally been piled up, opened, and is being transported. But the bandits in Daohu are still strong, Qifu crate of tea must be transported to Shanghai roundaboutly by Tunxi and Hangzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e287">What Kind of Elections Do We Need? <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiu</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Mr. Gongpu has repeatedly raised the issue of improving elections in this publication. Naturally, this issue is not only of significant importance in promoting municipal or local autonomy in practical terms, but also a crucial problem to be solved in the overall political transformation of China.</p>
<p>Although many past elections in China have failed due to unsound conditions, this should not be blamed on "elections" themselves. Because elections are only a method, and when people want the final judgment of social affairs to be in the hands of the majority, there is fundamentally no other method besides elections.</p>
<p>Therefore, our current demands for local autonomy and improved elections are actually to save and develop the spirit of democracy. We believe this is the minimum work to save the nation from political transformation and crisis.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current question is not whether we need to improve elections, but mainly what kind of elections we need. Regarding this, I believe:</p>
<p>First, what we need is universal suffrage. The gradual expansion of suffrage in modern times has progressed from class elections to universal elections. Therefore, we demand the abolition of all restrictions based on religion, economy, society, and gender. Everyone, except for underage children, patients with mental illness, and those deprived of their civil rights, should have the obligation and the right to participate in elections.</p>
<p>Second, we demand the expansion of real electoral power. The value of suffrage is mainly reflected in the number of elected officials. People's participation in elections is not only to elect advisory bodies for the government, but more importantly, to elect people who can represent their opinions and directly participate in the thorough resolution and execution of all major national or local issues. Therefore, we demand that the real power of elections should be expanded, and at the same time, we must save the implementation of the rights of initiative, referendum, and recall, because these three are interrelated.</p>
<p>Third, attention to election methods. We know that the value and effectiveness of suffrage are greatly related to voting methods. Open elections cannot fully express the will of the voters, and the "designated" election method completely loses the meaning of elections. Now, the election systems of various countries have almost all been changed to secret ballot systems. Therefore, we also demand that this election method be implemented in all elections in China.</p>
<p>Fourth, compulsory elections should be implemented. Suffrage is not only a right of the people but also a duty. Elections are a public service, and the state must use every means to ensure that the people perform this duty. In the past, the majority of our people were often indifferent to elections, on the one hand being manipulated by local tyrants and ambitious politicians, and on the other hand making the people uninterested in politics. Therefore, we advocate that the government should follow the example of countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Spain, and implement a compulsory election system, stipulating that those who do not participate in elections should be subject to certain economic or reputational penalties.</p>
<p>Fifth, demand strict laws against election fraud. Election fraud was a common phenomenon in our country's past. Now, if we don't talk about elections, then so be it. Once we talk about elections, on the positive side, we demand raising the political awareness of the general public; on the negative side, we demand a strict law against election fraud. The state must use laws to stipulate that anyone who bribes, entertains, intimidates, impersonates, or illegally uses election funds or campaign workers must be given strict punishment.</p>
<p>The above are our minimum demands for improving elections. Some say that this is just an unattainable high-sounding ideal. In fact, we know that if an election can truly represent public opinion, and if the result of an election can gain the support of the majority of the people, what better method do we have other than elections based on the above points? Therefore, we hope that the authorities in charge of elections should take this as a goal to promote the implementation of sound elections. Whether it is central politics, local autonomy, or social organizations, if there cannot be perfect and sound elections, then all ideals cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>Indeed, "having elections is better than having no elections," but simply "having elections" is not enough. We must also demand more perfect elections within "having elections"!</p>

<h3 id="e288">Blood Rice <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Long Lai</p>
<p>Living in this unreasonable society of "red doors reek of wine and meat, corpses lie frozen on the road," most people cannot even smell wine and meat. Rolling around on the line of hunger and death, in order to live, some have no choice but to painfully and cheaply auction off their labor, and some even sell their own children at low prices, stubbornly using the blood from their own bodies to exchange for leftovers to fill their bellies. This is what I want to talk about here: the working women who are hired by noble people to be wet nurses.</p>
<p>Just by walking through the "Employment Agencies" in Beijing, the "Matchmaking Shops" in Shanghai, or the "Human Markets" in Chengdu, and the "Guild Halls" in Chongqing, we will see these "blood sellers" squatting and sitting in rows like exhibits, waiting to be sold. Their eyes, filled with the bitter tears of separation from their husbands and children, are hungrily and attentively fixed on passersby. When they finally see a customer come in, they eagerly, for fear of making a mistake, hold out their eggplant-like breasts straight for people to choose and examine, feeling them up. As a result, those who are chosen leave with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy, following their masters (mostly to undergo blood tests by doctors). Those who are left behind after being picked over hang their heads in disappointment and wait for another customer. Who can see all this without feeling that it is a tragic drama? Aren't "blood sellers" even more pitiful than ordinary laborers?</p>
<p>Naturally, to give one's own blood to the sons and daughters of the nobles to suck, one must first put one's own children aside: the better option is to spend some money to entrust them to someone else's house, or leave them at home to be fed rice water; otherwise, if there is no one to entrust them to or no one to take care of them, one has no choice but to bear the pain and simply give them away or abandon them on the roadside or in the alley. When a person who does this kind of wet nursing holds someone else's child and feeds them her own milk, how deeply must she feel the pain in her heart! Especially when she sees the other person's child smiling at her with its little mouth open, reaching out its little hands to beckon her endearingly.</p>
<p>In terms of responsibility and work, wet nurses and ordinary maids and older sisters seem to be no different on the surface, but in reality, they are much more arduous than maids and older sisters. They not only bear the responsibility of feeding the child, but also have to bear the heavy responsibility for the child's development, health, illness, hygiene, etc. Therefore, once they are hired, they completely lose their freedom in terms of body and action. I remember there was such a tragicomedy: in the mansion of a couple who both claimed to be educators, the mistress supervised the wet nurse every day to rub some vanishing cream and face powder on her old melon-rind-like face, saying that her face was too ugly, and the girl would be afraid of resembling her in the future if she drank her milk. As a result, her face, which had been roughened by the wind and frost and haggard from labor, became feverish and painful from the cream and powder, so she couldn't tell whether to cry or laugh when she looked in the mirror. Speaking of action, it is simply no different from a prisoner in jail, because the young master or miss cannot go half a day or a night without feeding, so they are always unable to go home for a year or two. Clearly, they are married women, but the masters insist on them keeping "live widowhood." Not only that, but even walking around in the street or in a neighbor's house is subject to interference. If the child accidentally catches a cold and sneezes, then the masters will scold her for walking around with the child and catching a cold, and more severe masters will even use "deducting wages" and "getting out" to suppress her.</p>
<p>Washing the child's clothes and diapers, playing with the child, feeding milk, and rocking the cradle day and night, this is the general work of a wet nurse. In addition, buying vegetables, cooking,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>and doing needlework also have to be done. If the child is a little older, gradually grows teeth, and the sleep time is reduced, when they can barely crawl, then the wet nurse's work is no longer easy, and she must be careful to prevent him from falling at all times, and she must not leave her post even when sleeping. At this time, the child's every move is not as regular as when he was first born. Take his feeding as an example, before he is about to grow his small teeth, he will bite his nipples tightly while rubbing his gums, and after he has grown them, he will use his melon-seed-sized new teeth to tear and bite the nipples, often causing the wet nurse's face to twitch, but she cannot complain, and can only swallow the sour tears into her stomach. People eat people, this is really!</p>
<p>When the child is eight or nine months old, his appetite also increases compared to before. The wet nurse is always humbly afraid that her milk cannot satisfy him, and at the same time, she must diligently show the master that her milk is good, for fear that something will go wrong with her job. Therefore, whether it is day or night, as long as the child cries, she immediately puts her breasts into his mouth, letting that blood-sucking baby slowly suck, even if sometimes he sucks and hurts her flesh, emptying her blood, she has to endure the pain.</p>
<p>The leftovers in the messy cups and plates are the only food that the master gives to the wet nurse, and what they wear are the old, moldy clothes and pants from the bottom of their trunks. As for their wages, the highest is no more than ten yuan, and six or eight yuan is the most popular current price. If their own children are still being raised by someone else, then, in addition to the cost of raising their own children, what they earn besides the leftovers is only a thin body of anemia. This is the price of a "blood seller," this is the life of a blood-rice eater.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Chinese Language Teacher <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>People all know that Chinese language teachers are the most hardworking kind of teachers, but what kind of exhausting picture is actually unfolded in their lives is something that people may not fully understand. In the past year, I had the honor of being such a teacher in a private middle school in this city. I can't say that I really have much experience, but I don't deny that I do have some observations.</p>
<p>First of all, what I need to point out is the incorrect perception of these teachers in society. They think that education is noble, and therefore think that teachers, especially Chinese language teachers, are noble hermits who have not been stained by any earthly matters. But the fact is absolutely the opposite. Not only are they not noble hermits, not only do they need bread like ordinary people, but they also have to engage in fierce struggles for survival for bread. In this era of oversupply of talent, in order to hold on to their jobs, they have to use all kinds of methods to guard against competitors. Even if they want to be noble, they cannot.</p>
<p>Now I will show you the dark side of their lives here. Regardless of health, regardless of ability, they often teach at two, three, or even four or more schools. Some of them teach as many as five or six classes. In terms of hours, some of them teach thirty-six hours per week. They are completely using their bodies as machines. There is almost no talk of teaching efficiency here; we only see a group of people who are just trying to get by wriggling in the struggle.</p>
<p>The reason for this is obviously the excessive meager treatment, coupled with arrears in wages, so that what they earn each month with hard work may not even be enough to support their families. In this situation, what good way is there to call on them to pay attention to teaching efficiency and take on fewer hours?</p>
<p>According to the general situation of the education circle in China today, the price of their hard work is calculated by the hour, depending on the nature of the public or private school and the degree of development of that school, rather than the amount of their compensation. There is such a situation in Shanghai today: it is very difficult for teachers to receive their salaries at a middle school with only one or two years of history and about one hundred students, although the letter of appointment may stipulate that they should be able to receive five dimes of silver for each hour. They are not necessarily completely "fulfilling their obligations," because the school does solve their living problems such as "food" and "lodging" after all. At least they have the benefit of "being able to live in a hotel without paying," which can be said to be "half-obligatory" in nature. Sometimes, unexpectedly, they may even receive five to ten yuan per month for "transportation expenses."</p>
<p>In a slightly larger private middle school, Chinese language teachers can reliably receive five dimes per hour. If you teach Chinese language in a certain grade for six hours per week in such a school, then you can get twelve yuan, which is considered a sum of "cigarette money" that you have earned.</p>
<p>In a slightly more "established" private middle school, Chinese language teachers can get seven to eight dimes per hour. There is one school that I know of that is like this: seventh grade, seven dimes per hour; eighth grade, seven and a half dimes; ninth grade, eight dimes. (This article mainly describes the situation in middle school.) Private middle schools that pay one yuan per hour are very rare in Shanghai. Public junior high schools can generally reach this amount. In short, this is completely different from the situation in some provinces outside of Shanghai, where Chinese language teachers in junior high schools can receive one yuan, or one yuan and twenty-five cents, or one yuan and fifty cents per hour.</p>
<p>Although the treatment is so low, they are required to work twice as hard. Chinese language teachers need more time to grade Chinese language papers than to teach classes. There is not a single Chinese language teacher who does not have a headache when faced with some barely understandable papers. Usually, a Chinese language teacher who is not very experienced can only grade three or four papers in an hour, and those who are more efficient can only grade six or seven papers. However, there are many "lazy" methods in the middle, that is, to grade narrative essays easily, and argumentative essays are the most difficult. It is best for the students to write something very similar (or even exactly the same), such as asking them to write according to the "outline" you give them, or asking them to translate a classical Chinese essay into vernacular Chinese, or write a "short essay" of more than one hundred words, etc. The easiest thing to do is to tell a short story and ask them to write it down, or to present a short text from the textbook and ask them to delete the sentences that can be omitted to shorten the text. Grading twelve or thirteen or even fifteen or sixteen papers like this only takes you an hour. I remember once at a banquet hosted by the Beixin Bookstore to promote its "Mixed Mandarin" and "Beixin Anthology" for Chinese language teachers in middle schools in this city, a very healthy teacher said that he could grade fifteen or sixteen papers in an hour, and I guessed that he might be using this kind of easy method!</p>
<p>Some people may blame such teachers for being irresponsible, but they really have no choice. They are not only too busy, but also too tired. Usually, it is not too much for a Chinese language teacher to teach twenty hours per week. Teaching two classes of Chinese language and also history or geography, they already have three or four hours of classroom teaching every day, which forces them to return home with tired bodies and stare blankly at more than one hundred (fifty or sixty people per class is very common) barely understandable papers, feeling distressed. What's more, a part-time Chinese language teacher teaches even more hours than twenty hours?</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it is difficult to have time to engage in research work. The content of their lectures has to be pitifully poor. They have to perfunctorily deal with the students, please the students. Such a teacher has to be a "careless" teacher. Is there even any talk of teaching efficiency here?</p>
<p>In order to avoid "misleading children," I never want to be such a teacher again. But society cannot give people better things to do, and the knowledge sold from the university is completely useless to this society, and I have no other "expertise." For the sake of some necessity, even if I don't want to harm people in my heart, how is it possible?</p>

<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>About five years ago, I was introduced to this blacksmith shop. Among us, getting a job is seen like a scholar getting an official position.</p>
<p>This is where we work: on the sandy ground, piles of burning coal fires circled by iron plates, blown by the wind from the underground ventilation pipes, the fire burns very fiercely, and the temperature rises to an extremely high degree. At the same time, the black coal ash and yellow coal smoke also fly up together. Because there is a roof on top and walls on both sides, the air in this room is completely shrouded and occupied by this smoke and ash. When I first came to work here, it was really unbearable, because of the invasion of ash and smoke, my eyes were forced to shed tears all day long, and my nasal cavity and lungs were stimulated by strange smells, and my breathing was simply abnormal. But now I seem to be used to it and don't feel it. When it rains, the ash and smoke cannot get out, which makes it even more uncomfortable. Especially in the summer, with twenty or so piles of fierce coal fires burning, if people are not used to it, they will either die from the heat or suffocate.</p>
<p>Like workers in other departments, we start work at seven o'clock. We are in groups of two or three, each group occupying a pile of coal fire and an iron stool. We first pile the crushed coal tightly, and then chisel open a few holes to let the wind blow out, so that the fire can burn fiercely. Then we bury the wrought iron of the thing we want to make into the coal fire, clamp it with large tongs, and wait until it is burned to a certain color. Then we open the pile of coal, and at this time, the heat and strange smell rush out together. Then we pour cold water on it, and the ash and smoke fly up immediately. But we have to clamp the red-hot iron onto the iron stool without the slightest delay, and beat it with hammers, ding ding dang dang, you one hammer, I one hammer. After beating it, we let it cool, and then put it back in to burn, and then hammer it again after burning.</p>

<h3 id="e291">Reno, the Happy City of Divorce <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Mori-kun</p>
<p>This is an interesting story of a capitalist society. Reno, the capital of the state of Nevada in the United States, is geographically just a small metropolis in the barren western mountains, but it is a world-famous divorce city, just as Monaco is a world-famous gambling country.</p>
<p>Judge Stremmel, who allowed 20,000 divorce applications in the Reno divorce court in twelve years, said when he retired at the age of sixty-three: "Two-thirds of marriages are failed surgeries, only divorce."</p>
<p>"Come to Reno for a divorce, and restore the happiness of your marriage!"</p>
<p>In the United States, the laws of the forty-eight states are different. Some states believe that "what God has joined together, let no one separate," and South Carolina absolutely does not allow divorce; in the District of Columbia, divorce is only allowed in cases of adultery. Most states consider serious crimes, abandonment, and abuse as grounds for divorce, and there is a necessary "residence period" for applying for divorce, which must be resided in a certain place for one to three years. But in the state of Nevada, divorce procedures are extremely simple.</p>
<p>What makes the state of Nevada famous is not the snow of the Sierra Nevada (Spanish for "snowy mountains"), not the primeval forests, not the mining industry, but the convenient and rapid divorce law. Reno, together with Paris and Mexico City, is known as the three major divorce capitals of the world. At the same time, Reno is now also famous for gambling.</p>
<p>About seventy years ago, many people came to Reno for the mining industry, and after residing there for six months, they obtained full citizenship.</p>
<p>According to Nevada's divorce law, if divorce is applied for on the grounds of abandonment, failure to raise, or abuse, and there is no appeal, then a unilateral divorce is allowed; and remarriage is allowed immediately after divorce. Since everything in the United States likes to be quick, this is not without reason. Those who want a divorce all run to Reno. As long as they live there for six months, they can be blessed by local laws.</p>
<p>The special prosperity of this matter began about eleven or twelve years ago. Most of the divorce visitors are from the wealthy class, and there are always more than a thousand people every year, consuming two million dollars in gold and silver for this purpose. In this small place, this is really a considerable income.</p>
<p>Because most of the wealthy class come here to travel and divorce, the prosperity of gambling and dancing is also natural, but therefore, even more people come.</p>
<p>Later, the necessary residence period for divorce was reduced from six months to three months, so the number of visitors increased even more.</p>
<p>Now, comparing the numbers of foreign divorces before and after the reduction of the residence period, you can get a general idea:</p>
<p>Before the reduction: 1925—806 cases</p>
<p>After the reduction: 1927—1,603 cases</p>
<p>The economy of the entire United States is in recession, and the mining and railway industries are in decline. Many unemployed people in Reno have switched to the hotel industry, and business is very good.</p>
<p>Since May 1, 1931, the three-month residence period has been changed to six weeks. As a result, the unemployed people in the neighboring states of Oregon and Idaho have come to Reno to share in the waste of the wealthy.</p>
<p>Top-quality wine and top-quality singing and dancing always come to Reno. During the annual Independence Day (July 4), a large boxing match is also held. Recently, there have been 189 divorce cases every day in Reno, and each divorce case is completed in six to ten minutes.</p>
<p>Lawyers can earn one million yuan a year, the court earns 260,000 yuan a year, and public gambling houses earn one million yuan a week, or 52 million yuan a year.</p>
<p>Because remarriage is allowed immediately after divorce, many locals have become rich as a result. A small grocery store owner has become the match of a millionaire woman, and a flower girl can also hook up with a celebrity.</p>
<p>There is also a small thing that is worth mentioning, that is, many wealthy people often throw their wedding rings into the Truckee River in Reno, and some unemployed people and vagrants go to the river at night to pan for rings to exchange for food.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>This is repeated over and over again. We are full of coal ash and coal dust, our arms are sore, our hands are pinched sore, and we are sweating enough. Only after such tempering does the thing to be made become a rough shape. Sometimes when we encounter making large things, we can use the large steam-powered iron hammer to beat it, which is relatively less labor-intensive. It can be said that we completely hammer these things out by hand, because the foreman only gives us a piece of wrought iron and a pattern. Sometimes we also do the work of bending iron pipes. We take the part of the iron pipe to be bent to burn, burn it red, and then put it between two iron bars and bend it according to the drawing.</p>
<p>In addition to the eight and a half hours of work during the day, we also have to do night work. But not doing night work is something we absolutely don't want to do. Think about it, what can we do with seven or eight dimes of wages a day? Not doing night work would not even be able to support our families! The lower the job, the smaller the wage; the smaller the wage, the more we hope to do more night work. In short, we are desperately fighting with life!</p>
<p>The iron hammer is beating day after day, and the calendar pages are flying by page after page. Five years have passed quickly. During this period, I think we have hammered out a lot of things. They always create some happiness for people and earn profits for some people; but what about us? We are still auctioning off our labor by "sore arms," "pinched hands," and "sweating enough"! Moreover, some partners have been added to this blacksmith shop, and a few more piles of coal fires have been surrounded. The sound of the iron hammer is louder than before, and the coal ash and coal smoke are denser than before.</p>

<h3 id="e292">Conflicts Between England and Japan in Trade <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Xueyou</p>
<p>Anyone paying attention to recent international news would not overlook the recent skirmishes in the trade war between England and Japan, and the complete failure of Anglo-Japanese negotiations! Here, we will try to briefly describe the beginning and end of this Anglo-Japanese trade war.</p>
<p>Since Japan abandoned the gold standard in 1931, it has been actively expanding its trade to the world by taking advantage of the "decline in the value of the yen." As a result, the value of export trade in 1932 increased by 263 million yuan compared to the previous year, reaching a total of 1.41 billion yuan. In 1933, it made even greater strides, increasing by another 451 million yuan compared to 1932, reaching a total of 1.861 billion yuan. This made the British Empire, which claimed the top spot in world trade, unable to help but feel envious.</p>
<p>It wouldn't matter so much if Japan's trade volume was simply increasing gradually. Unfortunately, a quarter of Japan's exports are specifically sold to England itself and its dominions and colonies. In other words, in 1933, Japanese goods exported to the British Empire reached 484 million yen. Among them, goods exported to India were the most numerous, reaching 205 million yen, almost accounting for half of the entire British Empire's imports from Japan.</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately, England has always been the world's leading power in cotton textiles, and has always used cotton textiles as the main export to its dominions and colonies. Japan has just caught up with England, and the goods it exports to British dominions and colonies are also centered on cotton textiles. In terms of cotton textiles alone, in 1933, the total amount exported from Japan to various British territories reached 149 million yuan (877.7 million square yards). India had the most, reaching 71.1 million yen (451.1 million square yards).</p>
<p>During the same period, England exported 485 million square yards of cotton textiles to India. This is almost equal to Japan's export volume to India.</p>
<p>In order to protect its own cotton textile industry and consolidate the power of the British economic bloc, England had no choice but to devise ways to resist Japan's fierce attacks. In August 1932, the British government incited the Indian government to revise the import tariffs on cotton textiles. As a result, Japanese cotton textiles were subject to a heavy tax increase from 31 percent to 50 percent, while the import tax on British cotton textiles remained at 25 percent. In April 1933, British Foreign Secretary Simon also notified Japanese Ambassador to England Matsudaira that the Indo-Japanese commercial treaty concluded in 1904 would be abolished the following year. On September 25, representatives from both Japan and India gathered in Shimla, India, for a meeting that lasted half a month, but ultimately yielded no results. Later, on October 23, the meeting was moved to Delhi. After much consultation, an agreement was finally reached on January 5 of this year. According to this agreement, Japan's annual exports of cotton textiles to India shall not exceed 400 million square yards, and Japan shall purchase 1.5 million bales of raw cotton from India each year. The import tax on Japanese cotton textiles remains at 50 percent.</p>
<p>Now that the trade dispute between Japan and India has been resolved, they will take a step further to negotiate the trade issue between Japan and the British Empire. On February 14 of this year, the Anglo-Japanese private cotton industry conference opened in London. The representatives attending from both sides were all leading figures in their respective countries' cotton industries. After a month of negotiations, they finally broke down due to the issue of regional application (England advocated that the scope of the agreement should include markets in third countries other than England and Japan, while Japan insisted that it should be limited to England itself and its colonies). After the breakdown of the private conference, the entire issue was transferred to the governments of the two countries for resolution. After much back-and-forth consultation, they finally could not reach an agreement. On the 3rd of this month, British Minister of Commerce Runciman handed a memorandum to Japanese Ambassador to England Matsudaira, and thus the consultations between the governments of the two countries also broke down.</p>
<p>Now that the negotiations between the British and Japanese governments have broken down, the British government has mobilized all dominions and colonies to cooperate in rejecting Japanese goods. The Anglo-Japanese trade war has officially begun. (Recently, Australian Foreign Minister Latham went to Japan to hold preliminary trade negotiations with Foreign Minister Hirota. Although there are no official results yet, due to Australia's relationship as a British dominion, it is feared that there will be no satisfactory outcome in the future.) Although the Conservative Party of England (the most powerful force in the current cabinet) is still dreaming of the "Anglo-Japanese Alliance," the reality is already clear: the British cotton textile industry can no longer endure Japan's attacks, and from now on, they can only engage in hand-to-hand combat in the trade war.</p>
<p>Regarding England's military deployment in Singapore and various parts of Southeast Asia, the origins of the Anglo-Dutch secret meeting, and England's attitude in the midst of Japan's opposition to "international aid to China"...we can only grasp the true meaning from the fact of this conflict between England and Japan in trade.</p>

<h3 id="e293">Self-Study of Literature - A Few Basic Questions! <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>(1) How to Find a Starting Point for Research</p>
<p>Although the starting point of our research is the currently active and concrete literary movement, and the scope is roughly limited to existing Chinese creations and translations, it is a relatively narrow field. But how should beginners find a starting point for research? This is a pressing question.</p>
<p>Studying literature from the perspective of literary history, and then exploring the various branches in order according to the evolution of literature, is a research method from vertical to horizontal, and is a good method for self-study. But here, we have many difficulties: because what we are currently dealing with is literature that is constantly changing, and is a complex, contradictory, and mixed synthesis. There is a lack of systematic opinions and decisions on this phenomenon, like the relatively fixed opinions of past literary history. And the path to self-study that we want to find still requires us to look for living historical materials, to be diligent in exploring news about the organization and actions of the literary world, to collect papers, miscellaneous works, criticisms, anecdotes, and other historical materials about the literary world from the publishing industry and various literary and non-literary publications, and to enrich our own views. From these materials, you can see the mainstream and trends of literary activities. You can have a more accurate understanding of the current complex phenomena and not lose your way forward. Of course, the path that unfolds before you still needs to be determined by your own will.</p>
<p>(2) How to Increase the Ability to Discern</p>
<p>In order to have a considerable ability to understand modern works, you should have knowledge of literary theory. To understand a certain school of works, it is best to first read all the literary theories about that school. Although theory is deduced from facts, a scientific action takes the knowledge accumulated from past actions as the starting point of the theory. Therefore, scientific action is guided by theory.</p>
<p>We should have the following basic knowledge:</p>
<p>1. On Art Theory</p>
<p>2. On Literary Trends</p>
<p>3. On the Social Basis of Literature</p>
<p>4. On Aesthetics... and other more specialized research</p>
<p>This part of the research should account for a significant proportion and is the central point of literary research. From this, you can complete the tasks that should be fulfilled in the first item.</p>
<p>For the above aspects, it can naturally be used as a separate and specialized study.</p>
<p>Only when this part of the work is done sufficiently can you exert your power.</p>
<p>(3) Literature and Other Sciences</p>
<p>Literature is not an isolated thing that is unrelated to other sciences. On the contrary, it maintains appropriate and coordinated connections with social sciences and other sciences. If you want to study literary theory, you need to have a thicker foundation in social sciences and other sciences. A person who lacks research in social sciences cannot truly understand literature or be a literary scholar.</p>
<p>Should a writer and a reader alike deeply plant their own foundation and apply what they have learned to literature?</p>
<p>You must quickly learn the following sciences:</p>
<p>1. Basic knowledge of economics to understand modern society;</p>
<p>2. Basic knowledge of sociology to understand the course of social evolution;</p>
<p>3. Basic knowledge of social ideology to understand social consciousness;</p>
<p>4. Basic knowledge of philosophy on the themes of scientific worldview, worldview, and outlook on life.</p>
<p>(4) Literature and Life</p>
<p>Literature cannot be separated from life. To understand a modern work, even if you have the above theories, if you are detached from practical life, you cannot grasp the center of gravity of the times, and there is a danger of becoming mechanistic or metaphysical. Therefore, a writer and a reader alike should understand literature in practical life.</p>
<h3 id="e294">The Original Broadcast Station of International Broadcasting: Soviet Union's Flax and Ramie Farming <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>During the First Five-Year Plan, the area of flax cultivated land approximately doubled, expanding by 2.7 times compared to before the Great War. At the same time, in other European countries, this area was reduced by more than half (60 percent). In 1932, the Soviet Union's flax production accounted for 90 percent of the total global production.</p>
<p>The large increase in the area of flax fields is based on the social and economic changes in Soviet agriculture.</p>
<p>As for the area of ramie cultivated land, it has now increased to 800,000 hectares (Hectares, a French land area measurement unit), while before the Great War it was only 680,000 hectares.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, the main producers of flax and ramie were individual farmers (Individual Peasants). At that time (1928), the output of flax and ramie from collective farms only accounted for six thousandths of the total output. By 1932, collective farms and state-owned farms had become the main producers of flax and ramie, and their output had reached more than 65 percent of the total output.</p>
<p>What is particularly needed in the planting of flax and ramie are cultivation machine stations. In 1932, there were 261 such cultivation machine stations specifically designed for planting flax and ramie. There were 7,593 cultivation machines operating on 500,000 hectares of flax cultivated land (one times that of the remaining European countries) and 80,000 hectares of ramie cultivated land.</p>
<p>These many cultivation machine stations are all equipped with the most modern agricultural machinery. Here, there are the best-trained political supervisors, managers, and rural economic forces丨丨these are all powerful tools to greatly increase flax and ramie production.</p>
<p>State-owned farms and collective farms (mostly located in areas with cultivation machine stations) now have 15,000 well-trained flax processing workers.</p>
<p>The results obtained from the efforts to increase flax production are not only that the area of flax cultivated land has expanded, but also that there has been a significant increase in harvests, and the number of flax products that can be sent to the market has naturally increased even more.</p>
<p>The method of purchasing flax is now completely different from before. In the case of unstable market transaction prices, the state needs to stipulate in the contract that it will provide producers (collective or individual) with loan precedents, and the latter will supply cotton products to the state. In these contracts, the state provides producers with necessary production subsidies, such as supplying them with agricultural machinery, mineral fertilizers, grains, selected seeds, and credit and monetary advances. At the same time, flax producers engage in cultivating a certain amount of flax fields, and depending on the agricultural technical consumption required for this cultivation, they are required to contribute a certain percentage of the fine-quality harvest to the state within a certain period of time.</p>
<p>This loan contract for flax began to be piloted in 1927, and the one for ramie began to be piloted in 1929. During this period, this method was only piloted on 9 percent to 14 percent of the cultivated land area. By 1931 and 1932, the area cultivated using this method had increased to more than 84 percent of the total flax field area.</p>
<p>Regarding the collection of flax and ramie, the Soviet government has a special flax industry department to manage it. Here, they constantly plan how to increase production and improve quality.</p>
<p>The task assigned to flax and ramie producers in the First Five-Year Plan was to greatly expand the area of flax cultivated land, and this has developed exactly as desired. The 2.3 million hectares of flax fields and 860,000 hectares of ramie fields stipulated in the 1933 plan were realized without difficulty. Flax production increased by 20 percent in 1933, that is, the total output in one year was 550,000 tons.</p>

<p>After you understand the living environment of the upper social strata, you should also understand the lives of strata different from yours. Because of the differences in strata, there are obvious differences in inner consciousness; that is, in daily living habits, living styles, language, etc., different imprints are also left. How should you explore this? This is a very important and interesting question.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you must be loyal to your own life's investigation, meticulously record the truth, and clearly discern the characteristics of your own life stratum. Don't let go of any details. At the same time, you should talk to and mingle with people from different strata of life, and carefully understand everything about them. You should visit factories, mines, warships, schools, offices, slums, and even brothels and prisons. You should pay attention to the tragedies and comedies of life in various social strata. In the streets, trams, and theaters, you should patiently read court judgments, social news, and local communications.</p>
<p>All of these can provide you with rich materials and broaden your horizons.</p>
<p>The above is the most precious learning of life, not just for the study of literature.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Innocent Children: The Greatest Envoys of the Kingdom of Heaven <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Wang John</p>
<p>Children are great, so philosophers and poets throughout the ages have worshiped children.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "A great man does not lose the heart of a child." Jesus said: "Children are the greatest envoys of the kingdom of heaven." Lao Tzu said: "Concentrate on weakness like an infant." Goethe even said: "We should take them (children) as teachers." The great thinker Marx also often said: "The place in the Christian Bible that I pay the most attention to is its great friendship for children."</p>
<p>Why are children so worthy of worship? Is the worship of children just a momentary whim of adults? Or do adults really discover in children a greatness that adults do not have? Is the physical strength of children better than that of adults? Is the intelligence of children better than that of adults? Is the experience and thought of children better than that of adults?</p>
<p>To understand the true greatness of children, we cannot measure children with the views of ordinary people. We must experience the greatness of children from the children themselves. American child psychologist Hall said: "Childhood is the paradise of mankind, and adult life is a fall from this." This is absolutely correct. All the wisdom we adults have is inseparable from the prejudices of slaves. All my habits and all the traditions of the past oppress the minds of living people like nightmares. Adults, from childhood to death, do not escape the yoke of slaves. What qualifications do we have to comment on the personality of children?</p>
<p>Children, why are they great? It is because children have the innocence that adults do not have. Children cry when they want to cry, and laugh when they want to laugh. They never care about forces outside of themselves. The nature of children makes children only seek self-development and the satisfaction of happiness. A child is a fearless pursuer of happiness. Children can seek comfort from adults, but the things in their hands cannot be easily given to others. In other words, children are completely natural people who live for themselves. Children have absolutely no prejudices and moral concepts of adults. This is the greatness of children.</p>
<p>Some people may retort: If what you say is true, children are just selfish and self-interested creatures, what greatness is there to speak of, and what is there to worship? My answer is: Yes; children are indeed selfish and self-interested creatures, but this is precisely where the greatness of children lies.</p>
<p>What is greatness? Greatness refers to things that benefit mankind. The reason why children are great is because children are symbols of happiness.</p>
<p>Everyone lives for themselves, and everyone has the instinct to pursue happiness. And when he encounters obstacles in his pursuit of happiness, he can break through the obstacles without any hesitation. The destruction of objects that obstruct him by a child is a manifestation of this instinct. Therefore, many people say that if children had the strength of adults, they would be the greatest murderers in the world.</p>
<p>But we adults all come from children. How do adults lose the nature of childhood? This cannot but be attributed to the social system of mankind. In the long-term struggle for survival, mankind realized that it was necessary to sacrifice certain pleasures and development, and thus a social system that deviated from individual wishes naturally emerged. The social system is to the individual what the owner of a garden is to flowers and trees. The owner always tries to make the flowers and trees lose their self-wishes and development, so that they suit his own preferences. As a result, the social system deprives people of their absolute existence, making people no longer aware of themselves. Later, society not only makes its members sacrifice certain instinctive demands to satisfy certain instinctive demands, but also makes some people sacrifice instinctive demands to satisfy the unlimited demands of other people. At this point, mankind, as Rousseau said:</p>
<p>"Except for the whole and public life, they do not know that they have themselves."</p>
<p>But the needs, instincts, and desires of mankind to seek satisfaction will not be eradicated by suppression. Mankind is like an upward-growing willow. If you force it to bend, you can do it for a while, but its original nature will not change, and it will still flourish upward when artificial forces are out of reach. Therefore, Gaozi said: "Taking nature as benevolence and righteousness is like making a cup from a willow." If mankind cannot completely lose the instinct to seek satisfaction and freedom, children preserve the simple form of these instincts even more. Therefore, children become symbols of happy mankind and are envoys of the kingdom of heaven. The innocence of children awakens the slaves and adults who lost their instincts and desires at the entrance of civilization. Therefore, adults who feel like slaves respect this great enlightenment of children.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Two Fairy Tales for Children to Read <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Jinshan</p>
<p>The fairy tales that Chinese children read are mostly about princes, young masters, fairies, monsters...and other such characters. The influence of these fairy tales on children, apart from making them fantasize that they can also be in the same situation as the protagonists in the fairy tales, it is very difficult to find some fairy tales that instill social and scientific knowledge in children. But the few fairy tales I have seen now, although they were not written by Chinese people, but were translated, have fulfilled the above requirements and are suitable for Chinese children. So I am now making a brief introduction, which can also be regarded as doing a voluntary advertisement for the bookstore owner.</p>
<p>The first book is "Chaplin's Wanderings" written by the American new writer Colt. The story is about a little boy, Joe, and his two older brothers, Adam and Andy, who went on a picnic one day, but he himself was sick in bed because he ate too much ice cream. He asked to hold a race, but his mother said that the room was too small and could not be held, and asked him to have a good sleep, so he quarreled. But he couldn't resist the power of the sleepy devil, and slowly fell asleep. Then the clown Chaplin appeared. Chaplin carefully arranged a race for Joe; he took Joe to the mayor of New York to ask for a race permit, but the mayor said that the race was too troublesome for him and refused to issue it. Chaplin took Joe to ride an elephant to find the giant Jim 丨丨he was a very kind black man who could play the "Saxophone" (a kind of American musical instrument). The giant Jim kindly agreed to Joe's request, climbed onto the elephant, and began to play his "Saxophone." Everyone who heard him play the "Saxophone" would follow him, and gradually formed a huge race. Joe was very happy in his heart. When they arrived in New York, the mayor and his police had already taken their batons and prepared to arrest them for disturbing the peace. Chaplin escaped, and Joe escaped too. The mayor chased after Joe, and Joe was so scared that he was about to cry, and woke up.</p>
<p>You see, isn't this an interesting fairy tale?</p>
<p>Another book is "The Adventures of Little Trafta" written by Soviet Russian Lozanov, which gives children more novel revelations about society and science.</p>
<p>The story is of course also about a little boy, Trafta. Once, he and his father went out to be guests. But unfortunately, at the train station, the father and son were separated. So Trafta decided to be independent and start living his own life. In this way, in this book, the author tells each reader about the telegraph, the train station management system, the locomotive of the train, the signal machine, the telephone, the car, the postal telephone, the public taxi, the newspaper office, the typesetting, the page layout, the printing, the tram, the inquiry office... and also implies the socialist construction to the readers. The ending is of course that Trafta was found back by his father and mother.</p>
<p>These two books are accompanied by very moving illustrations. The former is 20 cents per volume, and the latter is 50 cents per volume.</p>

<p>Biography of a Famous Person</p>
<h3 id="e298">Marconi, Inventor of Wireless Radio (7) <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Sen Ran</p>
<p>We know that since the Renaissance, with the development of capitalism, there have already been many great inventions in science. Leaving aside everything else, just considering the inventions directly related to wireless radio, there were many even before Marconi became famous, such as the electromagnetic telegraph, the generator, the telephone, and wired telegraphy... all of which were invented before Marconi began his research. All these inventions, all the scientific and cultural heritage since the Renaissance, were the foundation for Marconi's invention of wireless radio. Without this foundation, no matter how intelligent or persistent he was, he would not have achieved such success. Imagine, if Marconi had been born in the dark ages of the Middle Ages, could he have invented wireless radio? Of course not! That's one point.</p>
<p>Secondly, the era in which Marconi lived was precisely the era of capitalism's development into imperialism. In this era, the capitalist economic network had already enveloped the entire world. Imperialist countries were vigorously competing for markets to sell goods, and frantically fighting for colonies. Under these circumstances, the rapid transmission of information was required for commerce, military affairs, and politics. Marconi's invention of wireless radio was realized under this demand. Here, we can say that the British naval exercises at that time, the South African War, and Marconi's success were closely related.</p>
<p>At the same time, the place where Marconi was born was also inseparable from his invention. We know that he was born in Italy and active in countries like Britain and the United States. These countries were all advanced countries, and their cultural level was above average. So-called modern civilization was represented by them. Only in such a social environment was it possible for Marconi to invent wireless radio. If he had been born in China or India, he would not have accomplished such a great undertaking.</p>
<p>In addition, Marconi's personal living environment was also very important. The issue is very clear: if he had not been born into a wealthy family, had not received a higher education, and furthermore, if he had not received guidance from Professor Righi, had not received hints from Dr. Hertz's experiments, and had not encountered the help of Preece, then I dare say that no matter how great a genius he was, he would eventually have been buried. As for the invention of wireless radio, that would have been left to others.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot deny Marconi's intelligence and perseverance. But these are only factors that made it possible for him to become a great inventor. It was the era, society, and his personal living environment that made this possibility a reality.</p>
<p>Finally, after evaluating Marconi, I hope that those who generally worship heroes and geniuses will not be superstitious about heroes and geniuses, and should understand them scientifically. Only in this way will we not fall into a mystical path! (The End)</p>
