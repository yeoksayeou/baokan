<p>時評</p>
<h3>意奥匃携手之意義　恒</h3>
<p>大戰告終。忌德復興者以法國爲最甚。恊約所加於德之苛酷條件。以法之主張爲多。奥國之獨立。小恊約之形成。亦皆得力於法。其後時日推遷。英意對德。漸生好感。故於國際壇坫之上。每每爲之聲援。唯自德之希脱拉登事後。國際視瞻。又爲一變。向之同情於德者。亦皆疑忌羣生矣。迨奥　猝作。國社黨奪取政權之隂謀敗露後。與奥毘連之意大利。尤感不安。英法意維持奥國獨立之主張。亦發動於意。今者意又進而謀與奥匃携手。是則德於世仇之法國以外。又添一個勁敵。是誠德國復興運動上之大不幸也。</p>
<p>意大利所以毅然與奥匃提携。原因雖多。而大要則爲德國圖奥所促成。意於大戰之際。棄三國同盟而加入恊約。其目的蓋在獲得阿爾巴尼亞之全部。與土耳其之南安那托爾。及擴大北非之殖民地。迨大戰告終。土耳其之領土。竟未有尺寸之獲得。阿爾巴尼亞。亦未爲所有。其以前所自信者。皆未能如願以償。然而其欲變阿得里海爲自國内海之宏謀。與夫窺伺巴爾幹半島之野心。則固未當一日忘也。如欲强割南斯拉夫之阜姆。操縱阿爾巴尼亞之政治。胥爲此種野心之表露。其欲得南斯拉夫而甘心之態度。咄咄逼人。苟無小恊約之存在。意南戰爭。早巳爆發。故小恊約者。實爲法國外交上精心之妙構。其意不僅在防德奥之命併。又在謀阻奥匃帝國之復活。更以抑止意大利在巴爾幹之發展。</p>
<p>故爲意大利計。欲求此後之發展。自非先從打破小恊約入手不可。欲求打破小恊約之結合。自非先行聯絡與國不可。於此最與意大利利害相共者。莫若今之匃牙利。蓋奥匃帝國崩潰而後。其地多入小恊約。而匃之國境。被割尤慘。舉凡鐵路河道林木礦産之可爲生資者。大半分割於小恊約。而匃人之被割入他國者。有三百萬之多。阿得里亞之海口。則爲南斯拉夫所據有。戰前之經濟體系。破壞殊甚。同時國境受小恊約三面包圍。不能動彈。爲解除其痛苦計。爲避免小恊約之壓迫計。爲尋求此後之出路計。自以與意聯合爲得策。蓋能如此。則不僅政治上可與小恊約相抵抗。同時經濟上亦能藉意之阜姆等海口。以爲吐納。其次可與意聯者。則爲奥國。奥若聯意。其利與匃同。唯奥向以與德合併爲得計。唯屢謀不成。漸有改弦更張之意。迨今次希黨圖奪奥政之隂謀敗露。更易促使奥意接近。而成今日意奥匃携手之局。</p>
<p>意奥匃有合作之可能。固如上述。然設無德國希黨之隂謀。則其合作之成。必不至若是之速。蓋意奥匃之合作成。則法所領導之小恊約。必將受其威脅。而影響法意之國交。故意大利擊破小恊約之心。雖蓄之巳久。而其以事實表現。則今爲第一次。前之所以猶豫不敢速决者。恐法之議其後也。今則不然。德之希黨。志在復仇。法之安全。時感威脅。設德奥之合併而成。於法當然不利。故於此而默視意大利在中歐之發展。要爲無可如何之辦法。除非德國稍歛其猛進之狂燄。法意自不至於衝突。故德奥今兹之衝突。實使意大利坐收其利。此後德之復興。當更增一重困難矣。</p>
<h3>對奥政策相左意德嫌隙日深</h3>
<p>多瑙河組軍事集團</p>
<p>中歐亂源重大要素</p>
<p>維也納　意大利外交次長蘇維區、本日午刻由匈牙利京城抵此、在意國公使館宴請陶爾斐斯總理、席終舉行談話、會商匈京談判及最近奥國事變、蘇氏當晚卽已啓程返國、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　意德因對於奥國問題意見相左、致兩國間之關係日趨緊張、歐洲各相邸皆爲惴惴不安、兩國爭論之主要點、雖爲奥國之獨立、但多瑙河流域之經濟解决問題、亦使兩國嫌隙日深、意國近提出關於此事之建議、而以奥國獨立爲重要條件、並爲奥匈兩國闢一經特萊斯特大約或再經阜姆而通海之出路、歐洲當軸之目光現咸集於意外次蘇維志一人之身、蘇氏數日前赴奥匈兩京後、今日再蒞奥京、與奥總理杜爾夫斯博士在意使署作長談、至討論之性質、未見明文、惟據非官塲消息、大約曾討論奥匈意三國成一經濟與軍事集團之可能性、蘇氏再至維也納、實出人意表、柏林政界頗爲不安、據一般人士之意見、中歐與波羅的海成立新集團、不能有裨於奥國問題之解决、亦不能增進歐洲之和平、而杜爾夫斯博士於目前之談判中、是否獲奥國民衆之贊助、亦殊可疑云、奥國之復辟、在德人眼光中、將成中歐混亂之另一重大要素云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>意大利報爲匈奥政策辯護</h3>
<p>羅馬　意大利各報一致爲意大利對匈奥兩國所採之政策作辯護、略謂外次蘇維區之赴匈京、久經决定、意大利對匈牙利及奥大利與以援助、乃自然之理、但此種援助旣無政治性質、亦不涉及關税聯合、小恊商各國絕不必因此自相驚擾、至於德國具有作用之消息、尤爲不可解、因德國有所主張之時、只須其所要求者合於公理、則意大利未有不積極予以援助者、晚報謂「凡有人欲爲不合公理之行爲、以妨害德國之時、意大利卽仗義執言、以友誼態度援助德國、而不求報酬、凡略知最近數年之歷史者、類能言之、」同一報紙又謂有人謂意大利時而與德接近、時而對法親善、周旋於兩大國間、態度不定、此種論調、乃權謀詭譎者之言也云云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>柏林否認武裝黨員集奥邊</h3>
<p>維也納　外傳德奥邊界境内集有多數德人、故内衛團現亦集於白洛諾附近邊界一帶、維也納不信德國對奥有施武裝攻擊之意、柏林方面亦切實否認國社黨黨員集於奥邊之說、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）　伯力來訊、上年九月被捕之中東路職員六人、經蘇聯日本及、「滿洲」代表在東京及哈爾濱談判之結果、已經釋放、蘇聯方面堅持以釋放被捕人員及恢復路政常態、爲重開出售中東路會議之先决條件、故六人之被釋放、得恢復北京奉天恊定所規定之中東路應有地位、省釋人員得自由返國、其所遺職務、將由蘇聯方面另任接充、至於在衝突時期「滿」方所任命之非法代理人員、亦將各返原任云、（二十四日塔斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據日外務省稱、俄僞之中東路非法交涉、自昨年九月僞組織大捕俄方路員、對俄示威、俄揭破日僞奪路隂謀以來、完全停頓、以至今日、廣田外相就職后、以打開日俄僵局爲己任、數次與俄方接洽結果、廣田提出妥恊條件如左、</p>
<p>（一）被捕俄路員六人、俄方主張立刻釋放復職、僞方主以僞職員代其任、雙方相持不下、决非上策、故日方提出妥恊案、卽僞組織釋放被捕俄職員、而俄國自動調返本國、其后任者由俄籍職員繼任、</p>
<p>（二）職員任免權屬於理事會、管理局長不能任免職員、以此和緩雙方之主張、</p>
<p>俄方巳接受日本之提案、僞國亦於昨日釋放俄員、其繼任者就職后、卽可再開會議、日僞希望於二十七八日中召開非法會議、（二十五日華聯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　「滿洲國」政府釋放中東路俄職員六人一事、巳在莫斯科造成良好印象、此間人士以爲此乃俄滿間鐵路爭執由緊張而趨和緩之起點、而俄日間衝突之危險、亦可因以稍减、據哈爾濱消息、俄員雖經釋放、但或須驅逐出境、其職務將由「滿洲國」助理員辦理之、至鐵路董事會派定接辦人員時而後止、（廿四日路透電）</p>

<p>（哈爾濱）　蘇「滿」國境河川航路會議及國境調查委員會、前因蘇聯之不誠意、以致决裂、「滿洲」政府正凖備單獨解决、乃昨日外交代表施履本訪駐哈俄領斯拉資基通告蘇職職員釋放時、俄領關於此兩會議、曾非公式聲明有凖備開會之意、「滿洲國」政府以蘇聯方面旣表示誠意、凖備開會、認爲足以改善蘇滿關係、决中止單獨行動、故上述二會議日内可以實現、</p>

<h3>日本政爭方興未艾</h3>
<p>軍財兩閥對立</p>
<p>軍部以綱紀暴露財閥政黨罪惡</p>
<p>財閥政黨以軍紀攻擊軍人干政</p>
<p>（東京）　日軍部與財閥之爭鬥、在六十五屆國會愈趨激烈、財閥以軍紀問題及軍民離間聲明追究軍部、軍部以綱紀問題曝露財閥及政黨之不正、雙方爭執相持不下、六十五屆國會之初期、荒木陸相因受財閥及部内兩面夾攻、稱病下臺、財閥乘機追擊、似巳得勝、惟到二月初軍閥反守爲攻、集全力先攻下中島商相、原來中島受財閥指使、操縱政民兩黨進攻軍部、軍部甚痛恨斯人、乃使上院之封建勢力、攻中島商相之不正、中島商相不支而稱病告退、軍部乘勝追擊、再提起鳩山、三土兩相之舞弊、其目的在於打破政黨聯合軍、使政友會先分裂、政黨内亂不息、相機倒閣、以期獲得下屆政權、政黨至最近巳知其隂謀、岡本查問會亦將取消極政策、提防軍部之詭計、阻止政黨自身之分裂、但政友會之内部甚複雜、防不勝防、雙方之鬥爭誰能得勝、在目前尚難預測、兹舉其内情如左、</p>
<h3>總裁派</h3>
<p>政友會之所謂總裁派、在田中總裁時代所結成者、斯時鈴木拉攏鳩山·森·久原·中橋·山本（悌）·秦·川村·勝田·中島·島田·松野·及山口等、對抗床次派、田中死後卽舉犬養爲總裁、以防床次爭總裁、五一五案犬養死后、鈴木自任總裁、在此時久原派與鈴木派分開自立一派、與鈴木抗爭、現在之總裁派重要份子如次、鳩山·安藤·蘆田·大野·森田·犬崎·石坂·星島·川村·島田·松野·田邊·山口·植原·志賀·廣瀨·土倉·岡田·村田·河上·川島·若宫·岡田·清水·熊谷·絞部·宫川·藤生·三上·牧野小林·中野·一瀨·若本等、在目前佔全黨大半之勢力、</p>
<h3>久原派</h3>
<p>田中大將任政友會總裁、其政治資金之一半、由久原房之助接濟、一半由陸軍省之機密費支出、始得維持其勢力、后來田中大將因張作霖曙殺案引咎去職、漸失其勢力、田中大將死后、久原乃接近鈴木派、與床次派對立、其主要人物爲：津雲·西方·藤井·田子·西村·難波·倉元·津崎·及岩崎等、其所屬份子約五十人、久原自身爲日本二流之軍閥、以日本産業公司爲其大本營、其財力爲黨内所重、</p>
<h3>山本派</h3>
<p>山本派之領袖爲山本悌次郎、山本前爲臺灣製糖公司之社長、榨取臺灣人之膏血、造成其今日之地位、曾任農相、田中死后、因其資産巳用完、其勢力巳不如故、其派下之主要人物爲：東·砂田·河野·立川·及武田等僅有十數人、對於鈴木·床次之爭、常取中立態度、</p>
<h3>床次派</h3>
<p>床次由民政黨退出返政友會以來、在黨内自成一派、原來鳩山·川村·水野·勝田等均爲床次派、因床次反覆無常、不足担任國政、遂棄床次而投降於鈴木派、其主要份子如下、藏園·樋口·兼田·春名·鈴木·瀧·寺田·豐田·東鄉·中村及森等、在黨内之同派人員共有六七十人、爲反鈴木之最大勢力、素稱舊政友會派之望月·岡崎·三土·濱田·今井·野田·及山本（條太郎）等、最近已漸接近床次派、</p>

<h3>德在貿易政策上的發展（德國通信）</h3>
<p>一九三三年中、世界各國在貿易政策上發展的情形如何、欲期明晰、自非重將歷年來貿易政策上經過的事項、追述一遍不可、世界經濟會議、或者尤其是她失敗的結果、對於商務關係的發展上、誠然是個重大打擊、但世界經濟的組織上、所以有進展不巳的變動、其原因由來、蓋巳甚久、</p>
<p>放棄世界經濟上極關重要的金本位之舉、和英國經濟團結的企圖、以及日本有堅强輸出工業的興起、再如各國無不圖謀不愛其他國家在發展上偶然的影響、這一切均是須籌謀新法、以復興世界商務的重大原因、近年來各國繼續施行的保護主義、（Ｐrotektionismus）在緊急情勢之下、定必促使各國與别國不相爲謀、各在其國民經濟上、使團結日趨嚴密、而自給自足主義、（Ａ、tarkic）亦將日趨膨脹、最後或竟至重返於久遠時代前的元始情形、然參加世界貿易的民族、並不願有這項進演、因爲各國雖欲將國民經濟使之獨立、然而他們都明白、倘要把各地及各國間氣候地理上不同之處、消滅捐除的話、必須有交通上及貿易上新時代的工業恊助、爲之輔弼、卽其他民族在精神上的成功、亦非此莫得參加、爲圖造成一種情勢起見、使國際間的貨物交换、能在增强的國民經濟之下、加以提高、數年來、各地巳見有試騐之舉、但以一切談判及會議之結果而言、各國對於戰後所發生的重大變化、則均懵懵未曾料及、此實毋庸諱言、另一方面、各國之經濟家、迄今仍尚以爲應恢復能以適合歐戰前時之情况、爲其理想上之解决辦法、奈有一事、則均忽未注意、卽「各民族間之一切溝通、無不須適合其内部之組織是也、」例如經濟上極端自由並無計劃之民族、欲使其國家管理對外貿易之關係、當是不可思議之事、反之、在有經濟計劃經營下之國民經濟、欲其在對外貿易上、不經重大頓挫一蹶而入於自由之制度者、亦爲不可能之事實、質言之、世界經濟上之重大崩潰、最後亦卽係經濟組織上及經濟意義上自相矛盾之處、考十九及二十世紀之經濟、均係賴自己之力、逐漸發展、以至於均勢地位、惜此項經濟、巳爲前次大戰所摧殘、嗣後各地乃有生産塲所代之新興、然其興也、旣非在自然情形之下、又無他人得與競爭、更有在國家保護之下、甚或在國家迫促之下、以丕成者、其間情節有如上述、然世間自無民族甘願使其此項新創設之生産受外國之競爭、不事抵抗、而歸消滅、亦自明甚、此外尚有凡爾賽之和約、蘇俄之特殊地位、以及遠東方面之混亂、對諸經濟均勢、賴己力以恢復其以往地位之處、在在無不事以阻擾、</p>
<p>佔有歐洲地面最廣之國、在其猛施國營對外貿易之際、上項均勢之是否能以恢復、假設僅在歐洲、是否有恢復之可能、對此問題、各遠謀之經濟家、均將對巳發生疑問、蓋蘇俄在其貨價計算上須特别另出立塲、卽此一端、他國巳經毫無能力以事抵消矣、幸賴蘇俄商務代表機關之措置有方、世界經濟、尚未致僅因此項蘇俄問題而有原則上的變更、然蘇俄經濟上變更、在其演進上、亦僅爲最使吾人注目之各事而巳、而事實上則更有他事亦足以促成同樣破壞經濟均勢之實現者、例如某國向來輸入巨額之食糧、一旦改弦易轍、加增其本國之食糧産額、而使其輸入之需求僅及其往昔輸入額之零數、試思及義國食糧戰爭的結果、卽可推知其他、再則、如一向爲某國之貨物供給者、一旦忽感覺本身無力、難容納對方相當數量之交换貨品、凡此種種、均足以破壞經濟之均勢、亦所必然、爲謀補救起見、數年未嘗有舉借債欵以事彌補商務結算上的負數之舉、然供給貨品者付還債權人之欵、債權人又以之償付所供給之貨物、如此、則成供給貨品者、自以己欵付給自己、遵循結果、遂使各該國家問在其付欵及商務之决算上、均受虧損、而其間情勢、絲毫無所更變焉、</p>
<p>一九三三年舉行經濟會議、嘗有消滅此項情形之企圖、然僅爲此端、各國之各自爲利、專以追求其本國之目的情形及各方均皆缺乏誠意、爲民族之共同犧牲之處、巳盡暴露無遺、而籌謀世界國際間總妥恊之試騐、至此亦遂須夀終正寢、世界經濟會議、實際上所得的僅有之結果、並非障礙之消除、蓋不過對於世界計劃經濟之初步事項、如設立委會、以計議小麥·糖·木料等之生産及分配而巳、</p>
<p>在世界經濟會議舉行不久之前、曾有一度關税休戰之成立、當時多數國家均皆參加、奈不轉瞬、若干國家已經宣告退出、致關税休戰對於貿易政策、幾巳無關重要之可言、而因世界經濟會議毫無結果之故、貿易上的停滯、又經繼續推展、貿易政策、原則的變化、亦遂隨之而生、各國在形式上雖尚維持最惠待遇的原則、然而已有若干國家變更初旨、而施行輸入調節的制度（Ｋontigcntierung）最惠待遇的規定、因而减失效用、</p>
<p>德國從世界經濟會議的經過中、獲到一種敎訓、卽各國之艱難、設欲求一國際之解决者、實難覓得、惟有賴各國國民經濟上之健全發展、世界經濟之危機、始克排除而巳、德國有鑑於此、遂致力於内部經濟之整理、而於排除龐大之失業患及籌謀振興農人之狀况上、尤爲盡力、其間所獲效果、巳甚顯著、如失業者之數目、巳减少二百五十萬人、市塲管理及貨價管理等辦法、更巳促使德國生産至於獨立、不復受世界市塲貨價漲落之影響、德國生利之農民經濟、因之亦巳獲有基礎、</p>
<p>此項辦法、旣導引工業之生産、趨於增進、而間接上亦裨益於德國對外貿易之發展、德國對外貿易之指數、在一九三二年中、雖曾一度終止降落、然於一九三三年中、則又繼續退减、並且降落極巨、致一九三三年中、德國之輸出額、僅及上年數額之半、其所以致此之故、蓋因德國始終拒絕將貨幣本位供給於貿易政策之試騐、至重要競爭國家如英美日等國、則均已放棄其金本位、而始行貶滙傾銷政策、德國此時、猶尚保持其貨幣之金本位、如此、輸出貿易旣銳行退减、外滙支絀、自必與之俱興、德國迫不獲巳、乃有實行外滙管理之舉、並爲使外滙在支配上易於結算起見、曾與各國訂有關於付欵及清算之恊定、付欵恊定、以形式言之、可分爲兩欵、卽國家恊定（卽政府間以紀錄形式簽訂者）及銀行恊定、（卽國家銀行與他國發行紙幣之銀行間所恊定者）</p>

<p>國家恊定之宗旨、在將輸入上之外滙限制事、以根本上的取消、並在此項情形之下、使國際間之貨物溝通、能以振發、進口商家、用以償付貨物輸入之欵、如超過所限外滙最高數額時、可在該國發行紙幣之銀行開一名户、俾於續行輸入貨物時、得無限制的以馬克付於所開户名之下、該外國發行紙幣之銀行、以該國貨幣付給外國貨物之債權人、而以在其户名下所存入之欵、用之以償付德國之出口貨品、惟此項恊定、僅有不受外滙壓迫及無强制經濟之國家、始能獲有效用、成立銀行恊定之意、在使與外滙弱小之國、能於付欵手續上、彼此謀得便利、簽約國所付欵項之本位、在恊定上、只以各該國之國幣爲限、雙方所有進出口上所欠欵項、使有銀行清算、如是、則每月結算上揭出之數、不特彼此抵劃、卽可竣事、卽彼國對此國所輸出之貨物、亦可准得付欵、職是之故、雙方之貿易溝通、當能賴以發展、）</p>

<h3>桂省經濟調查印象記（二）千家駨</h3>
<p>第二天一早、我們就去看李德隣先生、李先生談到廣西的經濟出路、他似乎特别關心廣西的入超問題、因爲廣西有一千二百萬人口、衣着全仰給于省外、卽以洋布一項來說、假定每人每年穿一套衣服、平均化二元錢、漏扈就以二千萬計了、「我們也很想以高税率來限制外貨的輸入、」李先生又說、「但一則易滋鄰省誤會、再則引起商民反對、所以迄無善法」、云云、李先生的話、是很值得我們注意的、因爲巨額的入超、不惟是廣西的嚴重問題、亦是全中國的嚴重問題、但抵補入超、據我們看來、似乎不能僅靠保護關税來解决、因爲我們卽把關税壁壘築得很高、外人仍得依不平等條約之保障、在華開廠製造、而且假如我們自己没有替代品的話、高的關税、結果還是由消費者來負担的、</p>
<p>從李先生宅中出來、回到旅館裏、不一會兒、李澧先生委托的青年會朋友劉君來看我們、劉君是香港青年會兒童部的幹事、據說旅居香港巳有十多年了、首先我們雇一Ｔaxi（街市汽車）環遊全市一周、香港的營業汽車、都停在馬路中心或街市繁盛之區、不必到汽車行去呌、隨處可以雇到的、但取費極昻、以四毛錢起碼、每十多分鐘約一元港洋、車上有自動指針、依時間之久暫、自動指到車費上、我們坐了不到半句鐘、指針巳指到二元五毛上、這實在太費了、于是我們就中途下來、改乘公共汽車去遊山頂纜車、山頂纜車爲香港地面與山上交通的一個主要機關、亦稱港島名勝之一、該道據聞爲英人Ａ.Finlay　Smith所建議興築、一八八五年動工、一八八八年完成、是年五月正式通車、一九○五年、山頂電車公司Ｐeak　Tramway　Co.Ltd成立、最初往返需時九分、且不停站、現則雖在同等路綫、沿途分停花園道·堅尼地道·寳雲道·梅道·柏架道·及山頂道六站、亦僅需時七分有半、又當該車啓用之初、車身原爲木質、頗覺笨重、後改用鋼車、自一九二七年起、又换用特製最新車輛、每輛可乘搭客五十三人、每天遊客平均約得三千人、六年前該車尚以蒸氣發動、今則改用電力、全車上落、用長約五千尺鋼製的纜來牽引、故名纜車、從開車以來、從没有失事過一次、纜車分頭二兩等、上或下一次、頭等票價爲每人三角、我們上車後、就坐在頭等車中、那知這時嚮導劉君暗暗拉我們的衣袖、低聲的說：Ｔhat　i　for　foiregners　only、卽是僅備外國人乘坐的）、我們聽得覺得很奇怪、爲什麽中國人連坐頭等電車的資格都没有呢！所以同行的韓君、就很詼諧的回答他、Ｙes，we　are　just　foreigner（我們就是外國人呵！）、不管三七二十一就在頭等坐了下來、事實立刻證明頭二等原不分中外、這僅是劉君的誤會吧了、劉君自己也不好意思起來、原來他也還是第一次乘坐哩、該山山頂距地面一千五百公尺、俯瞰全島、歷歷在目、我們在山頂上盤桓約十分鐘、隨卽復坐纜車下山、回到旅館、凖備今晚乘省港夜輪赴廣州、</p>
<p>香港離廣州海程八十九哩、航行約需八小時、我們于晚間九點鐘上船、船于十二時開行、當夜輪離香港時、在甲板上遠眺全島、只見電炬交輝、銀光萬點、宛如一座玲瓏透明的水晶山一樣、眞秀麗極了、我們看倦了港島的夜景、回到船上來睡了一覺、醒來時已經到了廣州、這次航程眞可說是我們生平最愉快的一回、因爲旅途中的枯乾與無聊、全被黑甜鄉中的一夢所替代了、但在省港輪上、也有一事可記的、我們的同艙、是一位廣東人王君、在香港一個什麽學校讀書的、這位王先生說二句話、終有一句Ｓure　或Of　Course、我們與他互通姓名後、韓君問他是否青年會會員、他的回答是Ｓure　why　notl、聽到這種肯定的答覆、我們眞嚇了一跳、到以後我們才知道在香港讀書不進青年會是例外的、第二天當船靠近廣州碼頭時、許多搬行李的苦力、看我們是外江人、故敲竹槓、我們因王君是廣東人、就問他苦力所索報酬、是否過昻、想他能把我們講一講價錢、那知這位王先生祇乾脆的回答了一句、Ｓure,too　much、就自己揚長而走了、我們祗有自己半使手勢、把行李交給搬夫運到新亞大酒店、說到新亞酒店、那眞是值得我們特别譽揚的、因爲中國大城市的旅館、大都藏汚納垢、爲抽烟打牌嫖妓薈萃之所、這種不正當的營業、往往形成他們收入的大宗、官廳卽欲禁止、也以積重難返、徒爲表面文章而巳、但廣州的新亞酒店、却眞正是一個例外、牠裏面絕對禁止抽烟打牌及呌條子的、到處他們貼有這種文告、凡有以上三種嗜好者、請不必光顧、這種清凈的空氣、是我們在中國任何地方的旅館、所呼吸不到的、至至房間的雅潔、招待的週至、那猶其餘事、所以在這裏我們願意把他們登了一個不化錢的廣告、要是初抵廣州的人、住新亞眞是再合適没有的了、</p>
<p>抵廣州後、我們就去訪李宗仁的參謀長張任民先生、張先生留我們在廣州稍住二三天、他說新近第四集團軍總司令部請來一位德醫史乃德Ｄr.Schneider、他們摧派一位副官送我們和德醫一同上南寗去、我們本不想在廣州多所躭擱的、但因一則赴桂語言諸多隔閡、而且路徑又太生疏、同時雷賓南先生也勸我們候副官同行、比較方便些、所以只得在廣州暫住下來、這兩天内、我們得便去看廣州的幾位朋友丨張喬門先生（廣東省政府統計股主任）和陳達材先生（廣東調查統計局局長）並問他們要了幾份廣東經濟調查的表格、以便帶到廣西去參考、</p>
<p>七月二十日、四集團軍派來送我們的邱劍成副官來新亞酒店通知我們、說决定次日上午十時離粤赴梧、囑我們預備行裝、到了第二天的九點鐘、邱副官來了、我們先搬上「洋划子、（兩廣人」</p>
<p>之稱Ｍotor　Boat）渡過對河的廣三路站、由此坐火車到三水、再由三水乘港梧快輪赴梧、火車于十一時十分開行、下午二時抵三水河口、剛下車站、就見有大批赤脚粗服的婦女、亂呌亂嚷、包圍前來、搶奪行李、幸我們有人護送、未被圍困、他們告訴我、這些都是來兜生意的舟婦、以後我們在廣西内地旅行所看見的、不但划船工作由女子担任、就連碼頭苦力、也幾幾乎完全是女子、男人反而鮮見、司空見慣、也就不以爲怪了、關于兩廣婦女勞動特别發達的原因、我們曾經和好幾位朋友討論過、大概歷史上的起源、是因爲兩廣子弟在中國過去的戰爭中、參加的特多壯丁多轉死溝壑、婦女自然不得不參加生産的勞動了、另一方面、兩廣人娶妾之風特盛、他們的所謂「妾」、其意義决不是上海那種養尊處優的所謂「姨太太」、而同時還是廉價勞動力的購買、這是婦女勞動的變相形態、有時一個男子的勞動、往往不能維持一家的生活、不得不由妻女做些散工、以添補家用、如像柳州的香作工人、平均每年要有三個月失業、這時就全賴老婆挑水以維持生活、這大概是婦女勞動繼續發達之一個經濟上的基礎吧、</p>
<p>抵三水後、改乘港梧快輪、船于下午五時開行、次晨上午九時抵達梧州、這才算眞正入了桂境、梧州素有「廣西的上海」之稱、實在說、梧州之于廣西、其重要性是還要勝過上海之于中國的、牠不僅是由桂入粤的孔道、同時還是桂滇黔三省對外貿易的中心、在地理上及軍事上梧州綰灘西兩江的咽喉、而經濟上則爲桂省商業、工業及金融薈萃之區、以前曾設置過梧州市、至民二十年始取消市政府、改歸縣治、但現在的市公安局與市工務局、仍直隸南寗省政府、關於　州、我們稍後當有更詳細的叙述、</p>

<p>本市新聞</p>
<h3>銀行公會電羅斯福原文</h3>
<p>自美總統羅斯福施行貨幣政策、使美元價格下落、以提高銀價、我國爲用銀國家、白銀有日漸流出國外之危機、銀行公會二十日特急電羅斯福、請其注意、該會以此事關係國際交涉、電文内容、嚴守秘密、申時社記者、昨向銀行界某方面探悉該電英文原稿、兹略譯如下、</p>
<h3>電羅原文</h3>
<p>原文略謂、本市銀行業同人、敬致意於貴大總統閣下、自貴總統施行復興計劃、使美元價格下跌、貴國物價果以上騰、失業者日漸减少、但敝國物産價格、將繼續下跌、白銀勢將流出、爲投機事業者造機會、况敝國數千年來天災人禍、人民生活、已陷於水深火熱之中、貴國購銀政策、若繼續進行、敝國農民生活、將益感困苦、國際匯兌、亦將有非常之混亂、雙方經濟、均蒙不利、敝國銀界同業、極盼望貴總統俯察敝國情形、將銀價採取穩健之步驟、勿使突然高漲、造成匯兌上之困難、特此電達、敬乞察納爲禱、上海銀行公會、號、</p>
<h3>料無覆電</h3>
<p>銀行公會電文、係二十日晚發出、迄昨晚止、羅斯福氏尚無覆電到滬、昨據銀行界某要人接美方私人電報、略謂、羅總統對銀行公會電報、未有若何表示、究竟如何、殊難明瞭、預料此事將無覆電、因該電並未經過外交方式電達、羅總統固無覆電之必要也、惟羅總統至少對於我國之利害、必根據此電而加以密切之注意云云、</p>
<h3>孫科昨日談話</h3>
<p>美國提高銀價勢在必行</p>
<p>憲法初稿三月一日公佈</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、於前晚出京、赴無錫游覽、已於前晚到滬、昨晨、孫氏在宅接見各報社記者、發表談話、兹記孫氏所談如下、</p>
<h3>中美兩國立塲不同</h3>
<p>孫氏對美國提高銀價、認爲中美兩國立塲不同、我國對此、並無所謂籌劃對策、蓋此事之發動者、不在我而在美、美國視白銀爲通貨、提高銀價、卽係提高其本國之物價、以壓低金價、美爲用金國、壓低金價、卽爲提高物價、此至爲明顯、至美國之所以突欲提高銀價者、係受一般銀礦主之運動、爲自身謀利益、其所持之理由、以爲提高銀價、壓低金價後、可助長中國之購買力、多量吸收美貨、孰知此種片面理由、完全錯誤、蓋中國以銀爲本位、銀價提高、幣價亦漲、土産物價低落、當此商業不振之時、突然提高銀價、則其影響更甚、中國處於此種情形之下、謂能增加購買力、實一疑問、故美國此舉、完全爲經濟理想之錯誤而巳、</p>
<h3>今日追悼比王</h3>
<p>上午十一時半舉行</p>
<p>吳市長等均親參加</p>
<p>比王亞爾培一世、慘遭不幸、舉世驚悼、本市比王追悼會、定今晨十一時三十分、在天主堂街聖約瑟禮拜堂内舉行、其儀式爲天主敎之追思大禮彌撒、由比使紀佑穆主持、此神父及惠大主敎主祭、駐滬各國使領、海陸軍武官、屆時均一律參加、本市吳市長、保安處長楊虎、外辦處長余銘、警備司令部參謀長、及海軍高級人員等、除致送花圈外、亦均凖時參與、比使俟本市追悼會後、卽晚入京、趕往主持二十八日在京舉行之追悼比王大會、</p>
<h3>必須實現無法補救</h3>
<p>聞美國此種運動、其實現恐不能變更、現下已有相當之進展、其計劃擬將銀價提高至金銀成爲一與十二之比、慾望之奢可知、蓋美國現下金銀價格之比、爲一與三十餘之比、今欲提高其價格、達若是之鉅、本埠銀行界雖已電美制止、恐難奏效、蓋美國對提高銀價主張、頗爲堅决、將來銀價提高後、中國白銀將流出、硬貨勢須缺少、如謂禁銀出口、恐亦無從奏效、因中國國防不嚴、無法防止也、</p>
<h3>國際關係無甚影響</h3>
<p>至提高銀價、與國際上之關係、因各國均爲用金國、無甚影響、銀價提高、卽等於物價提高、故用金國與用銀國之利害完全相反、美國爲國民經濟主義、决不顧及他人之利害、故亦無如之何、倫敦銀價恊定緩行批准、亦屬無用、全國經濟會對此、尚未聞有何討論、不過全國經濟會有經濟專家、對此問題、似應加以研究也、政府對此事、除滬銀行家已有所表示外、别無補救之辦法、恐銀行界此舉、亦未必能轉移美國之意旨也、</p>
<h3>憲法初稿定期公佈</h3>
<p>嗣謂、憲法初稿、業已完成、定三月一日（星期四）發表、發表以後、希望國人能予研究、加以批評、俾立法院院務會議時、得修正完善、完成再稿、送交中政會、提出於明年四月國民大會中通過、此次初稿中有三點、足資研究、而較可注意者、計（一）在中央組織中、如在國民大會閉會期間、設一國民委員會、以繼承其職務、例如監察院有彈劾大總統及其他重要案件時、可請由該會承受、臨時召集國民大會解决之、其在平時、等於元老地位、備爲政府咨詢、其性質似與日本之元老相同、惟日本則不在憲法規定之内、而有一部份係代表國民代表大會者、（二）關於地方組織、省不稱地方、而純爲中央之行政區、市縣稱地方、卽規定爲地方自治團體之單位、將來國民大會選舉代表時、卽以上述所規定之單位、每一單位、選舉一代表、惟市毘近首都、則另訂辦法、（三）敎育經費、向來祗一千數百萬元、此次經過長時間之討論、或主籠統規定、或主明白規定、結果、僉認明白規定、較爲妥善、故初稿中規定敎育經費預算、在中央總預算中、佔百分之十五、在地方總預算中、佔百分之三十、以中央經費八萬萬而論、每年敎育經費約可佔一萬六千萬元、以前相較、幾十與一之比、若是規定以後、以後敎育經費、决不致再生問題、而經費充足、則促進敎育、亦可减免困難矣、</p>
<h3>新省問題整飭吏治</h3>
<p>至於新疆問題、在事實上中央確有派大員前往之必要、惟新疆變亂原因、或誤爲係宗敎問題、實屬不確、蓋其最大原因、係由於吏治不良、苛政雜捐、致引起惡感、出之走險、反抗政府、復以馬仲英等擾攘不休、遂益陷於不良、該省人民回族居多、爲吏者皆屬漢人、復經幕後者之挑撥、致認爲係宗敎問題、故目前敉亂辦法、首先應整飭吏治、解除其痛苦、則釜底抽薪、事態可不致擴大、</p>
<h3>推舉總理絕無此事</h3>
<p>記者旋以大美晚報所載、中央有推舉總理之紀載、詢之孫氏、據謂、此事不確、蓋此係黨章所規定、苟有所更動、則爲修改總章問題矣、似此時不致有此主張、故本人亦從未有所聞云、</p>
<h3>孔宋昨晨會晤</h3>
<p>交换白銀恊定意見</p>
<p>今日召銀行界談話</p>
<p>大公社云、財政部長孔祥熙氏、以美政府將重鑄銀幣、提高銀價、其影響所及、與我國利害甚鉅、除現正愼重考慮上海銀行公會暫緩批准白銀恊定請求外、並以此項白銀恊定、係前財長宋子文代表我國出席倫敦經濟會議時所簽定、此事究應如何處理、必須與宋前財長詳細研討、昨日上午十時許、孔財長自西愛咸斯路寓所驅車至祁齊路與宋氏會晤、交换白銀恊定一切意見、會談至十一時二十分始辭出、結果如何、一時尚難探悉、孔財長爲愼重處理白銀恊定問題起見、巳决定於今日（廿六）起、分别召集銀行界各重要人物談話、徵詢意見、以便縝密研究、至銀行界各領袖李馥蓀·張公權·徐寄賸·等、决向孔財長面陳利害、繼續抗議銀價提高、</p>

<p>中國保護動物會、於昨日下午二時、假赫德路覺園、舉行成立大會、到黨政名流五百餘人、卽席通過章程、選出理事、頗極一時之盛、兹分誌各情於後、</p>
<h3>到會名流</h3>
<p>昨到有吳鐵城（李大超代）·姜懷素·黄涵之·王曉籟·葉恭綽·關炯之·朱子橋（查良釗代）·孔祥熙·胡伯康·李經緯·金濟南·黄琢成·趙樸初·朱燮臣·釋圓瑛·大悲·性定·等五百餘人、黨政出席指導、有市黨部毛雲·社會局顔文藝、</p>
<h3>開會情形</h3>
<p>行禮如儀、首由主席報告發起動物會宗旨、（詞另錄）次李經緯報告籌備經過、（略）繼由李大超·姜懷素·毛雲·等相繼致詞、（另錄）、旋卽通過章程、並票選理事二十一人、遂攝影而散、</p>
<h3>主席報告</h3>
<p>主席葉恭綽報告詞云、中國保護動物會、今日開成立大會、承各位來賓及各機關團體代表光降、非常感幸、並謹代本會感謝、保護動物會、是世界各國普遍的慈善機關、並非中國所獨創、蓋吾人對於各種動物、均應平等看待、不可恣意殘殺、各國所以有保護動物會的組織、就是這種意思、現在各先進國家的憲法内、也有保護動物的條例、我們中國、向來缺少此種機關、使各種動物、失其保障、就中國今日的現狀、本會的工作、一定是不容易收速效的、顯係一種永久的事業、亦可說是一種移風易俗的事業、說不定三十年五十年一百年的下去都可以、但我們應有很堅久的力量、繼續我們的工作、現在尤應該先鞏固基礎、設法多補充會員、培植本會健全的根本、</p>
<h3>李大超詞</h3>
<p>吳市長代表李大超詞云、今天中國保護動物會開成立大會、兄弟代表吳市長前來參加、因爲没有預備演說、現在就簡單的來說幾句、以前我們中國對於動物有所謂放生、但此種放生、消極的、没有什麽力量的、今日中國動物會、是一種有組織有力量的機關、與以前所謂放生、就不可同日而語了、今日我們到會參加的責任、應當身體力行、對於没參加的人、尤當勸導他來參加、使此種慈悲工作、慢慢由上海普及到全中國云、</p>
<h3>黨部訓詞</h3>
<p>（一）上海特别執行委員會書記長姜懷素詞略云、保護動物會的發動點、在於「仁」、我們革命的意義、也是一個仁字、兄弟參加本會的志趣、亦在於斯、但保護動物的範圍太廣泛、市黨部對於這個問題、曾經過很詳細的討論、結果當以有益於我們的應加保護、反之、有害我們的、譬如殘暴的野獸、吃稻的害蟲、那是誰都應該捕殺、希望本會、亦本此宗旨、輕重較量云云、（二）市黨部代表毛雲詞略云、中國之有保護動物會、尚以今日始、古人謂好生之道、人皆有之、蓋人類之於生物、本來祇有形體不同而已、生活是一樣的、所以保護動物的機關、是很需要云云、</p>
<h3>當選理事</h3>
<p>票選結果、當選理事二十一人、王一亭·關炯之·葉玉甫·黄涵之·李經緯·孔庸之·朱石僧·聶雲台·朱子橋·許靜仁·聞蘭亭·陳飛我·沈彬翰·王曉籟·王彬彦·張一塵·鍾可托·史量才·沈之謙·李廷安·鄔崇音、候補十人、席與同·圓瑛·范古農·姜懷素·林康侯·丁仲祜·譚仲輝·陸連奎·大悲·太虚</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀不懂國際經濟新聞（二）</h3>
<p>來函所詢問題，分條答覆於後。</p>
<p>（一）本報流通圖書館創辦「讀書指導」的目的，並非單爲本館讀者服務，同時也很希望能帮助一切失學而又極願讀書的人解决讀書疑難。我們因爲如要使大衆眞正能够得到圖書館的益處，不是單供給許多書籍就可了事的，就現在一般人文化程度的低落言，我們實有帮助讀者選擇讀物，解决讀書疑難的任務，所以我們纔敢冒險來創設這種事業。當然，這是一個很繁難的事情，它旣無先例可資遵循，也缺乏可用的參考資料；我們的一切工作都在試騐之中。因此，我們在開始時不敢把規模做得很大，須試辦若干期間，看看成績如何之後，我們纔敢談發展謀普及。我們規定參加者暫以本館讀者爲限，這是有不得巳的苦衷的。不過，我們對於不能參加本部研究的人，也仍希望能帮助他們，所以在本報上登載的「讀書問答」並不限於參加本部研究者，凡是貼本欄印花的來信而所詢問題係讀書疑難者，本部也一律予以答覆，並擇其事關一般者在報上公表。陳君及讀者欲知其詳，可參閱今年一月四日本報「讀書問答規約」（登在本埠新聞之後）及本館圖書目錄彙編内「讀書指導緣起」</p>
<p>（二）關於讀書報遇到了術語和新名詞之不能了解，感覺到此種痛苦的誠不在少數。解决這種困難，我們覺得祇有勤於翻辭書（見本欄二月九·十兩日「辭書的用處」）。但是從陳君所詢的問題看來，單靠翻辭書也還是不够的，因爲困難的所在，有些還是由於基礎學識的缺乏；有些在於瀏覽的書報太少。譬如陳君所舉的幾個名詞，降了「金解禁」「金輸出」等之外，釋「美國收買黄金」，「美元貶價」，照字面解如，也是可以懂得了，陳君所以不懂者，是「美國爲什麽要收買黄金呢？」是「美元爲什麽要貶價？」這些問題。所以陳君要解决這些問題，還需要先讀一兩本該學科的原理書籍，多閱讀報紙雜誌。關於社會科學，大概可以分兩方面：一是叙述社會現象的；一是說明或分析社會現象的。前者是事實之紀述；後者則爲事實内容或性質之解剖和說明。譬如「美國收買黄金」是一件事實，「美國爲什麽要收買黄金」却是事實内容或問題性質之說明。我們看人家「變戲法」，看得很玄妙，不過若有人給我們解說了，「出把戲」的手法，却一點都不希奇了。所以研究社會現象，固然要注重觀察，卽多知道些實際情形，因爲不從實證上去了解理論是很危險的；然而不懂得理論，單去觀察事實，那也和看「變戲法」一樣，但知它是很「玄妙」，却莫明其妙。這是陳君和與陳君有同感者，第一點應當注意的。</p>
<p>社會是時時刻刻都在變動，它决不是停滯不前的。所以社會上不時有新的事件産生，尤其處在這社會大變動時代，因而「新名詞」或「現代語」也一天天的增加起來。譬如「貨幣恊定」「金解禁」「黄金政策」等等都是近代和現在纔發生的事實，要懂得這些名詞的函義，第一是翻字典，第二是看時事雜誌上有關這類名詞的論文（因爲辭典中的字是一個個爬入的，當時發生的事實很少能馬上爬入辭典。而報紙上的新聞又祇說明事實的梗概，所以要知事實内容的闡明，非看雜誌不可。）這是第二點應注意的。</p>
<p>現在再介紹幾種書：</p>
<p>（甲）一般理論之部。研究經濟現象，入手時應先讀一本概論書，陳豹隱譯的經濟學大綱（樂羣版）比較上是個完善的讀物，可一讀；惟此書較深，宜先讀陳豹隱所著經濟現象之體系（樂華版）。此後你如喜歡研究貨幣，可讀喜爾科丁的「金融資本論」（神州國光社有譯本，書名「財政資本論」）至於你所舉的書，祗可供以後參考用，是不宜在入手時讀的。此外你並應明瞭現在的經濟狀况，你看了上面幾本書，不過在原理方面有了個基礎，至於最近的經濟狀况你還不知道，所以你還應讀些說明近數年經濟情勢的書。伏爾加每年有一本「世界經濟與經濟政策」，伏爾加是當代有名經濟學家，他的分析比較上可以說是正確的。所以你應當讀一下。此書一九二九年與一九三二年的中國巳有譯本。（前者爲水沫版後者爲神州版）</p>
<p>（乙）辭典書可參看二月二十一日「辭書的用處」一文内所舉的書，兹不多贅。關於一般時事的雜誌，國内出版的頗多，若欲都讀，不但要化費無數時間金錢，而且也無這種必要。所以你平常祇要讀一兩種雜誌就行，如申報月刊時事類編等，其餘的雜誌則看你需要研究的東西，隨時去找。最好你買一本「期刊索引」（中山文化敎育館出版）因爲這個刊物，宅可以告訴你：你所要讀的題目在那些雜誌上是有的。</p>
<p>二研究「經濟學」入手辦法及應讀那些書，本部現巳約專家撰述「經濟學研究法」，作系統的正確的指示，以供讀者參考。出版後你可購閱。惟照你的情形，在入手時可讀前面介紹的幾本書。</p>

<h3>科學</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>科學，本來是解决自然界一切神秘事物的工具，但是，不幸得很，到這年頭兒，科學的本身，竟也成爲一個神秘之謎了。瞧吧，駕了二個翼子，一個馬達，便能横渡大西洋。架起了一根天綫，通了電流，東半球上的人們，便能面對了一個小小的收音機，暢聆西半球上放送的音浪。影片巳是够神秘的了，如今在活動之外，再來玩一個有聲的。馬達的力，巳是够受用的了，這一個世紀裏，或許還可以瞧見不用馬達，不用電流的機器人，普遍地替代馬達的力與人力。這些還不算希罕，據說近來竟有人能把盲人的眼角膜，移到别一個盲人的眼裏去，而恢復後者視官的作用。還有一位科學家，試騐成功了控制男女胎的構成。這些，都是數千年來人們理想中的事，而且是誰都不敢相信會有實現之一日的，但是，現在，竟給科學老先生，一一表演給我們看了。這，我們怎得不承認科學本身是一個比大自然的一切，更不容易被人打破的一個謎呢。</p>
<p>這個謎究竟神秘到如何程度，我們且不用管，總之，科學對於人類，有偉大到無可估計的貢獻，對於世界的文化，有着偉大到無可形容的功績，是任何人都不容否認的。但是我們若是回過頭來一瞧，天哪，這位科學老先生的嘴臉，竟是完全不同了。我們所見到的科學老先生，竟在努力地用飛機大砲，没命地在那裏屠戮人類，毁滅文化。近來聽說有人在那裏計劃着用無綫電控制潛艇，從食鹽中提練出多量的綠氣。於是一般人都可以想像得到未來世界大戰的情形，以及這位科學老先生，將在未來的世界大戰中，如何地努力於屠戮人類，毁滅文化的工作。</p>
<p>科學老先生已往的功績，值得頌贊麽？未來的罪惡，值得咒詛麽？這就是一個難下斷語的問題，因爲造成繁榮的是科學，造成經濟恐慌的，也是科學。</p>
<p>科學，眞是一個神秘到透頂之謎，超乎一切自然界的神秘之謎。</p>
<h3>打國度</h3>
<p>— 孟韜</p>
<p>今夜，我同姪兒玩「打國度」，什麽呌打國度？就是在方方的一小塊石板上，居然也成立了一個小世界，因爲是一個小世界，所以倒也弄得滿地風雲，朝不保夕。</p>
<p>戰是免不了的：戰機是在一刻一刻的近來。</p>
<p>當在滿板都着上了各個的顔色；我便是成了一角的大國；我的國名也就是代上了中國，並且還自傲的加上了「大」。</p>
<p>姪兒的形勢，已是大半給我包圍；假如我只要再决一戰；那末說不定也就是我青天白日滿地紅的天下。</p>
<p>「不怕，我是小結實；所以我就是日本，現在的日本，正就是我」。姪兒還倔强的說着。</p>
<p>大約中國總是大國；所以做事也就馬虎，在我一個大意的一刹那，拳是發輸了。</p>
<p>結局便是應該日本打中國。</p>
<p>於是在一角的大地，是滿佈着敵隊的鐵蹄；在中國的一角，畫上了一個小圓圈，算是戰事的標的。</p>
<p>眞是意料之外，每次的打圈，總不能命中的姪兒；這次看他很隨意的一畫，老大的中國是在糊塗中失去了。</p>
<p>在鬨堂大笑聲中，還隱約的聽到：「哈！哈！…老大的中國，原來如此！」</p>
<h3>酌酒與金松岑先生</h3>
<p>— 陳柱尊</p>
<p>我有一尊酒。滌公千歳憂。文能動天地。俗不任沈浮。書豈免奏火。民皆同楚囚。興亡吾輩責。詩不異春秋。（松岑先生工詩，所作多關詩史，近修通志，撰列傳甚多）。</p>
<h3>盤斗寅奉省政府命重赴歐洲考察賦此送行</h3>
<p>— 陳柱尊</p>
<p>欲作長風送遠游。凄然百感滿心頭。中原萁豆皆昆弟。大地風雲捲亞歐。歷聘幾人同季札。神游枉我學莊周。他時重賦巴黎句。還有豪情似昔不。（斗寅前度游巴黎，賦絕句數首，豪情逸興，令人一讀一擊節，今則國勢日下，恐不勝今昔之異矣。）</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十四回　酌酒傳餐狂歡含别涙　挑燈温夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>一會兒功夫，他用木托盆，端了兩碗熱騰騰的麵進來，向自强笑道：你看我預備得快不快？自强道：快是快，不過勞累你一夜通宵，我心裏不過意。桂枝放下托盆，兩手端了麵碗，恭恭敬敬的，放到自强面前，笑道：就算是勞累，也不過……底下還有只是今天一晚六個字，立刻吞了下去，接着道：倘右能够天天晚上這樣的勞累，我也是願意的呢。自强也不願向下追問，自端起碗來吃麵。桂枝並不坐在旁邊看着，口裏可吚吚唔唔的唱了起來。自强挑了麵望着他道：你怎麽不吃一點子？桂枝笑道：我唱高興了，只管要向下唱，不唱完我不痛快，我是不吃什麽的。自强以爲他是眞話，倒也不疑。可是這時夜靜了，一切的聲浪，都巳停止，遠處若有什麽響動，自然是聽得清清楚楚。桂枝雖是坐在身邊，輕聲低唱，可是天空裏被風吹來的更鑼更梆聲，依然聽得清楚。自强這就明白了，桂枝並不是愛唱，乃是怕自己聽出更鑼聲，不能安神，所以唱起來打岔，把更鑼聲就遮掩過去了。這樣看起來，他未免用心良苦。於是也就眞個把更聲置之不理，顚頭幌腦的，聽着桂枝來唱。把一碗麵吃完了，自己索興也來唱，讓桂枝去吃麵。唱了一陣子老生，又唱一陣大花，最後還唱了一段彩樓配的青衣。儘管腔不成腔，味也無味，可是唱得很高興。桂枝以爲是自己把自强的戲癮勾發了，所以大唱而特唱。用手摸了一摸茶壺，茶巳凉了，便笑道：你吃了麵就唱，又鹹又渴，我去找一點開水來泡茶你喝罷。（三二一）</p>
<h3>孩子的彌月</h3>
<p>— 唐增庚</p>
<p>我眞不忍，眼見着跟我受苦的妻，整整的懷了十個月的肚子，那一種愁眉不展面黄肌瘦的神情，至今我還深留在腦底，再有那生産時的顫抖和痛苦，我也覺得深深的不安和負疚，總算，小生命是好好的從呱呱中來到了這世界，現在巳整整的有一個月了。</p>
<p>孩子的彌月，媽歡喜，妻歡喜，我也歡喜，但是爲了近來經濟的十二分困難，不希望有一個做滿月的意外消費，但是，爲了塲面，又不得不勉强做一做，唉，爲了這虚僞的塲面，我眞生生的苦了一世。</p>
<p>「今天是寳寳的滿月，無論怎樣總得想法子做做，何况我們又是第一個孩子呢？」妻對我說。</p>
<p>「做，我何嘗不想做，塲面，我又何嘗不想撑，但是，没有那撈什子的錢，又怎麽辦呢？」我垂着頭，滿面愁容，懊喪的說。</p>
<p>妻不作聲，停了一回說：「我這裏還有兩件棉襖，你先拿去當一當，把面子撑了過去。」</p>
<p>想到這嚴寒的冬日，將妻這僅有的兩件棉襖當掉，心裏實在有些不忽，但是自己的早巳當完了，只有横着心，硬着頭皮，提着這兩件東西，在朝奉先生勢利的眼光下，换得了兩張一元頭的鈔票。</p>
<p>懷着極度的不悦，和媽兩個買了些麵，買了些肉和菜，爲的是，這第一個孩子的彌月，面上雖是滿堆着勉强的笑，心裏却是十二分的難受和凄凉。</p>
<p>整整的忙了一天，把孩子的滿月麵到鄰居家去分分，中飯還請同住的幾家貼鄰吃了一次。</p>
<p>無謂的，清淡的，總算過了這孩子的彌月，我並不覺得有絲毫的歡欣和樂趣，只是在心的深處，刻劃着一條悲痛的創痕而已！</p>
<p>「阿根的娘，喔唷，我從來没有看見過這樣的人家，什麽第一個孩子滿月，竟做得這樣的冷靜，滿月麵是這樣的淡而無味，肉又是這樣薄薄的一片，從前我們阿毛滿月時，眞要比他們熱鬧呢！」</p>
<p>「是啊，我活了四十來歳的年紀，這樣的滿月還是第一次看見呢，除了這一餐便飯外，一些也没有響動，老實說，我把平日的菜，也要比他們的好呢，哼，總算我們晦氣，過見了這種倒運的人家。」</p>
<p>寂靜的深夜，我聽得隔壁房東的女人和前樓嫂嫂在輕輕的低說着我只有凄愴的對妻苦苦的笑了一下，妻亦只有流下了伊滴滴的眼涙，唉，孩子的彌月，虚僞的塲面；這勢利的人間！</p>
<p>新發明</p>
<h3>煤油治肺病的證明（上）</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>本月六日，余在本欄發表煤油可以治肺病的新發明後，連續的接到高雲·白鷗·洪鼎·吳恊平·顧謙·朱新銘張桂衡·王同一·王毅諸君來函詢問，函中所詢，大致（一）要求余詳細聲明披露，以免患者嘗試，誤人生命？（二）全國同胞患肺結核者，十之二三，倘有效騐，卽可挽救數百萬的生命？（三）所謂煤油，是否亞西亞牌子，還是美孚，貝殻，和尚帽牌子？（四）飮的次數與時間，還欠明白？（五）飮後將發生什麽樣副作用，會不會發生危險？（六）這種新發明，是否聽人傳說？（七）煤油與軋司林的區别等，余今爲證明解答起見，把日本雜誌「主婦之友，家庭生活幸福號，新年號，該誌特派員所發表的論文，與各醫學博士證明的事實，」詳細的節譯出來。（請查該誌原文三百四十八頁起至三百六十五頁題爲用煤油治肺病的實騐記與三月號主婦之友（二三六丨二五一頁）曁醫學博士山田夀一氏著結核之煤油療法」等不過本欄因限於篇幅，終究不能完全揭載祇好節其要領，譯告諸君罷了。（一）兵庫縣立兒童研究所所長醫學博士速水寅三，證明百人百效的煤油治肺病法的成績，丨他說；數百人的實騐者，結果不好者祗有一人，爲什麽呢？煤油原爲一種乳劑，有强烈的殺菌性，飮服毫無害處，我先把種種事實推敲起來，實爲很有力的發見。就是俄國人與愛司基馬人，自古有用煤油代酒的。岡山縣某資本家，飮煤油後身體頓呈健康，後來活到百十幾歳。山口縣下松煤油公司内的職員工人，共在煤油工塲勞動的，没有一個患肺的，但是在事務所辦公的，那多患肺病了。余聽到這等話後，急急把自己身上來試騐，先把飮服煤油後，檢查有没有害處，不過余雖不患肺病，可是余吸烟草過多，患了咳嗽，所以余用煤油三十克蘭姆，分數次飮服，結果余的胃腸病，腎臟病，完全除根。當余飮煤油後的第二日，最顯著的現象，食慾亢進，咳嗽突止。其後爲檢查煤油的殺菌力，特將結核菌放在培養器内，用稀薄煤油一滴，落在器内，器内的結核菌，死滅無遺。現今又把石鼠與兎繼續實騐，其成績已在學會上發表。經過實騐的結果，愈加確信安全有效，所以余對於有肺病的人，奉勸其速飮煤油。余今再把治好的實例，據出一二個，來證明一下。某學校的助手Ａ氏，年二十七歳，兩肺巳潰爛如蜂窠，在這五六年間，盡試所有治療方法，病勢一進一退，不能痊愈，其後用煤油飮服，每次飮十五至二十克蘭姆，在一星期内飮了六次，竟把肺病全治了。商大生Ｋ君二十二歳，經校醫與某博士二人的診斷，患肺尖加答爾，飮了煤油兩次，炎症立消。又余的知友患脊推加里愛司，亦飮煤油而痊愈。我們研究所有勤務，因患糖尿病，亦用煤油治好。大凡向余詢問飮用法，得到良好的結果者，到了今日，不下數百人，所得效果竟收到百分％的好成績。飮用的方法，依年齡與體格，略有加减。但是我大體而言，最初飮十克蘭姆，最多飮到十五克蘭姆，從十克蘭姆逐漸增加分量，次數以多飮爲宜（煤油一合，約二○○克蘭姆，最好買一隻刻有克蘭姆的玻璃杯，那就不會多少了。）飮的時間，以午後九點爲最宜，廢止晚飯，臨睡時飮服，第二次隔了四天至五天飮服，第三次隔了五日至一星期飮服。飮亦不難，因爲不吃晚飯，可免嘔吐。</p>

<h3>舊醫新釋攻錯（續）</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>（五）兹再就舊說而論。素問稱「月事不來者。胞脈閉也。胞脈者。屬心。而絡於胞中。今氣上迫肺。心氣不得下通。故月事不來也。」蓋心氣下通。而爲血。女子至胸而下。卽爲月事。若氣上迫肺。則眞氣上逆。口苦。舌乾。驚則欬甚。推演之。血出自心下行。則至生殖器。而爲月事。此生理現象也。上迫肺。則血逆不順。發生各種症象。至於欬甚。其爲肺結核。而致月事不來。可無疑義。然而絕不言及病在生殖器局部也。金匱亦謂。「因虚積冷。結氣爲證。經水斷絕。至有歷年血寒。積結胞門。寒傷經絡。凝堅在上。嘔吐。涎唾。久成肺癰。形體損益」云云。歸原積冷血寒。亘久則成肺癰。蓋肺癰者。肺組織軟化腐爛之謂也。蓋已入肺結核後期矣。是又經水斷絕。與肺結核有關聯之一明證也。張從政言。「月事不來。愼勿服峻熱之藥。若服之。則變成肺痿。骨蒸。潮熱。欬嗽。咯膿。嘔吐而喘。小便澀滯。寢汗不已。漸至形瘦脈大」云云。皆後期肺結核之徵。月事不來。體中早伏結核。絕非峻熱藥所可變致也。故李梴謂。經水不通。不出虚熱疲氣四證不調。按此四證。雖其義甚廣。而與肺結核。則極有關聯。虚者。虚弱也。熱者。潮熱也。疲者。咯疲也。氣者呼吸不順也。以此四證不調。雖謂爲肺結核所致。固無不可也。王肯堂證治凖繩謂。「婦人女子經閉不行。其三候中之一。乃脾胃傷損。飮食减少。氣耗血枯而不行者。法當補其脾胃。養其血氣。以待氣充血生。經自行矣。不可妄用通經之劑。則中氣益損。隂血益乾。致成癆瘵之疾。而不可救。」亦明明指經閉。由結核所致。張介賓言。「經候徵少。漸漸不通。手足骨肉煩疼。日漸贏瘦。漸生潮熱。其脈徵數。此由隂虚血弱。陽往乘之。少水不能滅盛火。火逼水涸。耗亡津液。亦皆肺結核之徵也。寇宗奭曰。「女子憂愁思慮。則傷心。而血逆渴。神色先散。月水先閉。且心病。則不能養脾。故不嗜食。脾虚。則金虧。故發嗽。腎水絕。則木氣不榮。而四肢乾痿。故多怒。鬢髮焦。筋骨痿。若五臟傳遍。則死。」雖皆屬結核症象。絕無子宫結核之徵。惟肺結核。則不能獨免也。故張景岳。以爲經閉有血隔血枯之不同。隔者。病發於暫。通之則愈。枯者。其來也漸。補養乃充。故血枯。不可通經。而所謂乾血癆者。屬於血枯。其理甚明。惟考血之所以枯。必有其所自。腹中論謂。胸脅支滿。妨於食。肝病傳脾。聞腥臊莫。出清液。若以肝病。而肺乘之。則唾血。河間六書。以爲年少醉入房室。氣竭肝傷。肝傷則血涸。脾胃相傳。大脱其血。目眩心煩。李杲十書。以爲血脈津液所化。中消胃熱。善食漸瘦。津液不生。故肌肉消瘦。時見燥渴。血海枯竭。醫學入門稱。經止後。用力太過。入房太甚。及服食燥熱。以致火動。邪氣盛而精血衰。東垣又分爲上中下三因。火在上。則得於勞心。火在中。則善飢消渴。火在下。則大小便秘澀。總按血之枯渴。當非限於一因。然所謂乾血勞者。旣原於結核。又屬於血枯。則血枯來因。當爲結核毒素之消耗。影響全身。致使卵子不熟。卒乃月事不來。决不因充血通經之子宫粘膜。被結核菌侵襲局部。起貧血而致中斷也明矣。</p>
<p>綜核諸因。證以事實。丁君之所謂乾血癆。乃子宫結核。想必有所考據。不然。皆隔膜推擬之辭。决非眞理。以予所知。合之新說。揆之舊論。無一吻合。難以自容。所謂舊醫新釋之一家言歟。質之丁君。以爲如何。</p>
<h3>破傷風之治療及預防法</h3>
<p>— 翟紹衡</p>
<p>臍風卽破傷風。我鄉之俗名曰鎖口痙。以其發病之際。牙關緊閉。不能哺乳。故有此名。關於本病之原因。在歐洲上古希臘時代。希保克拉脱斯氏之記載中。巳認定其有傳染性。西歷一八八四年。意大利人賈來及賴通兩氏。曾將本病患有膿疤周圍之組織液。注射於家兎。而起同樣之症。翌年業考監衣兒及勞神白哈二氏先後證明本病之芽胞及細菌。旋由日本北里氏確定病原之性質及病菌之純粹培養。均巳能大白爲破傷風菌之傳染矣。及今仍在五里霧中之我國。則除極少數之新醫而外。仍持荒謬無稽之談。我鄉迷信之輩。以爲是産生時有人開關鎖房所致。故通常均於生産前。將産室内所有箱籠抽屜之鎖。一概開放。爲免産時或産後取物時不再有開鎖之必要。以爲避免産兒發生本病之惟一預防法。故産前未開者。有一定期内。雖有必要。亦祇有不開。已開而時。有再開之必要者。决不上鎖。舊醫之說。以爲是産後臍帶殘部進風而起。故臍部必須嚴密包裹。按風乃空氣流動而生。以科學醫之細菌學言之。不無可以曲解之處。蓋空氣中本含有無數各種細菌。其包裹之目的。卽所以避免病原菌侵入之門　也。所謂臍風者。卽感染新醫之所謂破傷風菌而起也。破傷風菌。乃一種桿菌。一端膨大。狀如鑼搥。體極微細。爲肉眼所不能見。然於顯微鏡下窺之。則可歷歷證明。該菌專犯馬牛羊豚犬等獸畜之類。對於人類。在醫學精進之國。已至僅少絕無之境地。然在我國。則尚時有所見。而尤以初生兒及乳兒被染者爲最多。一染此病。必登鬼籙。往往有一家數子。連殁於是病。而仍不知其所以然者。良可憫焉。</p>
<p>本病必由創傷傳染。故亦創傷傳染之病。我人全身體表。苟有創傷。則無處不可侵入。而引起本病。固不限於初生兒之臍部也。有由顔面之創傷侵入者。曰顔面破傷風。有由産婦生殖器之創傷侵入者。曰産褥破傷風。初生兒破傷風大抵由臍帶切斷面侵入。農夫亦時有患之者。蓋因破傷風菌好生於田野庭園之土壤中也。我國舊式産婆。其切斷臍帶之利器。往往檢抬地上之碎碗殘片充之。倘遇該菌附着其上。則無異直接種植破傷風於臍部也。此外臍帶結紥之綫。包裹之布。無一非不潔之物。乃介乎於無知穩婆。引染斯疾。其禍遂致覆絕嗣續。謂由自召可也。</p>
<p>兹旣明本病之由來矣。我再進而言本病之症狀預防以及療法。</p>
<p>症狀</p>
<p>破傷風之潛伏期。凡四乃至十日。甚有經過三星期以上者。在潛伏期中。絕不現任何症狀。故創傷之輕微者。往往已於較長之潛伏期中治愈。而不知病菌已侵入體内播種生苗矣。其初發之徵。病者先於下顎顔面及項部。諸筋感覺强直緊張。旋因顔面筋緊張。而呈一種特異之顔貌。其額皺。其鼻唇溝深陷。其口向左右牽引。開口困難。牙關緊閉。面容一變。雖其親生之母。亦往往不能認識是曰破傷風顔。頸部强直。因程度而不同。有頭部向後屈者。有仍得自由運動者。迨强直進行。則漸及腹背諸筋。繼而四肢軀幹。恰如一尾乾魚。是曰前方反張。背筋及上肢下肢之筋。起持續的緊張性痙攣。則身向後牽。形成弓狀。是曰角弓反張。其緊張之程度。恒隨衝動樣發作而增强。此發作往往因輕微之刺戟而發。發作頻數者。且有劇烈之疼痛。更因本症病人之意識完全明瞭。並以知覺不受障碍。故其所呈苦悶之狀。誠有令人不能不寄同情者。此時其汗腺涙腺之分泌增加。因疼痛而致涕涙交流。更足使旁人望而酸鼻。體温上昇。可高達四○丨四四度。其呼吸及嚥下。因胸筋及横隔膜痙攣。遂感困。心臟機能。旋亦促進。而脈數增至一○○丨一二○。熱久則尿中稍呈蛋白。尿道及大腸筋起痙攣。則尿糞排泄。均感困難。</p>
<p>預防法</p>
<p>對於初生兒破傷風之唯一預防法。爲處置臍帶所用之剪刀結紥綫臍繃帶及接産者之兩手。均須經過嚴密之消毒。臍帶初落時。新生肉芽。無異創面。亦爲破傷風菌侵入之極好機會。故宜留意。對於褥婦破傷風之預防法。亦惟消毒是重。至其他不潔之創傷及有不易除却的異物之創傷。而有破傷風傳染之疑者。除實行後述之局部療法外。於創面周圍連續八日。每日注射抗毒素二○單位。作爲預防。有益無害。切莫躊躇。惜預防血清之效力。對於人類不如獸類之顯著耳。</p>
<p>療法</p>
<p>本病無特效療法。　　雖在醫學精進之國。其死亡率尚占百分之五○丨九○。在我中國。可稱絕症。以是最要注意預防。兹述現今通行療法之大概。以資不幸而被染者之參考。然因療法複雜。症變無常。故以住院治療較爲便利。</p>
<p>破傷風療法。分一般，局部，血清與藥物療法四種。分别述之如左。</p>
<p>（一）一般療法　患者移臥於僻靜之室。勿使多受聲響及日光之刺戟。而免反射機之亢進。營養食餌。竭力注意。牙關緊閉或嚥下困難者。當用滋養浣腸。（未完）</p>

<h3>嬰兒發疹之種種</h3>
<p>— 侯光迪</p>
<p>春天疾患以小兒之痧痘爲最盛。自種痘風行。天花一症巳日形減少。但麻疹，風疹，猩紅熱等。在此人烟稠密之都市。常有披猖之患。其發疹之現象。苟不早爲辨别。非陷於治療之錯誤。卽致預防之疏忽。爰將小兒發疹之種種。略述於下。倘亦衛生家所注意也。</p>
<p>第一屬於玫瑰疹者。係單獨之小圓紅班點。有時含過渡性。以指按之卽不見。共有六種。</p>
<p>（甲）腸窒扶斯玫瑰疹。係局部而定式的淡紅點。發現於乳臍之間。大約在發病後第二星期。僅數日之久。有時稍似皮疹。至大如扁豆。圓形而稀少。是腸窒扶斯也。</p>
<p>（乙）各種傳染症初發性之玫瑰疹。乃過渡而暫時的。往往爲發疹之前驅。如水痘。曾經種痘之痘疹。腦膜炎，肺炎，僂麻支斯，多發性關節炎，膿毒症，腮腺炎，粟粒炎性結核症，流行性感冒，咽峽炎，百日咳，丹毒，白喉等症。</p>
<p>（丙）中毒性之玫瑰疹　如肉食中毒。臘腸中毒等。</p>
<p>（丁）因皮膚上之激刺而發現玫瑰疹者。如藥液之濕　等。</p>
<p>戊因汗分泌而起之汗疹。常在汗多之處。</p>
<p>己皮面的粟粒性結核之玫瑰疹。</p>
<p>第二似麻疹（卽痧子）類之發疹者。係無定式。而不甚明顯之班點。初發祇小點。繼擴大至扁豆形。或有過之。共有七種。</p>
<p>（甲）麻疹俗名痧子。初起似點狀小泡。後呈不平整之小點。密如星羅。於皮膚上略隆起。或平坦。點之中央雖有泡狀之小結。而鮮成皮皰。且時有血之滲入。此疹先現於額際。而及顔面。三日内廣佈至全體。</p>
<p>（乙）風疹狀似麻疹。而無皮疹狀。微帶褪皮。大如扁豆。略圓。鮮至融合。初發時中央似有小結。漸則無之。發疹之前。並不發見内膜之疹。（如口腔）豆蓋。手心。足心。常波及發於四肢者。大半在陽面。此疹不過二三日卽消退。體温並不升騰。</p>
<p>（丙）傳染性紅疹係在軀幹部。</p>
<p>（丁）隨他種傳染症而起之發疹。如白喉。水痘。巳種痘之痘疹。往往難於辨别。而所藉以診斷者。無非由於他種徵象之觀察。與熱度之經過。</p>
<p>（戊）藥物之出疹。如安知必林，綠養，氷，及注射血清等。往往先發風塊。（卽蕁麻疹）兼患連續熱。蛋白尿。發疹。常從注射部爲起點。左右肢呈同樣之疹。而鱗及於面部。</p>

<p>（丙）他種傳染病之發疹。如腸窒扶司，肺炎，流行性感冒，膿毒症，白喉症，水痘，其區别於猩紅者。卽乏紅點之與週圍紅色。漸漸打成一片（在猩紅熱發作之前）之現象。</p>
<p>（丁）藥疹及血清病。如内服亞脱落，並規那，水楊酸，鴉片，水銀，及注射異性的血清。其發疹早則在注射後第二日。遲則隔二十日。而大半在第八至第十四日之間。宛似猩紅熱。惟赤色稍差。而較散漫。所發局部亦似猩紅。但熾烈减之。常以注射部爲起點。引起附近膿腫。及蛋白尿。連續熱等。此症無嘔吐。無褪皮。（與猩紅熱有别）</p>
<p>（戊）白喉症恨復期之類猩紅熱。其發疹如猩紅熱。又如上述之血清疹。）雖未注射。亦有此徵）。但兼喉峽炎。及代阿所反應。此症大約爲變相之钽紅熱。在獲得白喉免痘性後而發者。</p>
<p>第四圓圈狀及弧形紅班類。凡較大而隆起之紅點。因中央之色素黯淡。遂成圓圈形。及後周圍蔓延。或互相融合。或半隱去。則變爲奇幻形。</p>

<p>且各人服法相同。（以ＢＣ.Ｇ.三生的格蘭姆分爲三服每服一生的格蘭姆在二十四小時間服盡卽於早晨飯前半小時空心吞下）經過三個月之後。曾有八十二名（卽百分之五十五）對於結核菌液之試騐。能發生反應。因而變爲有反應性者。其人數之比例。較之曾受皮下注射各孩童方面所得之比例。高出百分之十。今於此文發表之時。已有最先貯瓶而爲成年人及二歳幼童口服之血清。送達外省矣。</p>
<p>預防結核病之堡壘</p>
<p>凡此組織，（化騐室與Ｂ.Ｃ.Ｇ.之預備以及用以作爲試騐之獸類與紙簽櫃等）必須有適合於巴斯德研究院及法國之偉大建設而後可，自數月以來，結核病研究所業已成立樓房三層，高臨Ｆalguiere街，其正門在焉，側面五層　立於研究院花園之上，而其中之各化騐室，則爲世界之最美備者，至其建築係於三年之前，由巴斯德研究院院長Ｒoux君及該院之董事會决定起先預定之費用，爲八百萬，其中六百萬係由基金中撥付，其餘二百萬則由國家從跑馬税提給，其實該項費用之總數，巳近一千萬，蓋此建築實以樸素閎大爲本，至其一切規畫，原先係由建築師Ｄuquesne君所定，嗣以工未竣而身先卒，故由Ｂitterlin君完其成，今以篇幅有限之故，執筆人無從將此法國之科學聖地，加以相當之描摹，然以大略而言，可以分爲三部，共一卽製造Ｂ.Ｃ.Ｇ.之部，其二爲化騐部，其三爲試騐動物部，及各附　所皆在焉，按各創辦人有一謹守之原則，卽係將製造預防藥之部，與培養毒菌之化騐部，釐然分隔是也，其臨Ｆalgniere街之第一層樓中在Ｇuerin醫士直接監視之下，則有專家預備培養，Ｂ.Ｃ.Ｇ.菌苗之質料，或任栽種事務，或任原質預防，藥之乳化工作，其法則用帶有求不生繡小鋼球之轉動電器以成之，此後則以分注器將藥灌入各小瓶中，瓶口則用燈火封閉之，該樓第二層中之景象，似乎最爲雜異，該處則有關於實用工作之大化騐室，其中可容二十四人，同時工作，研究人類或獸類之各種結核病，此外尚有各主任之化騐室，及最奇異而可稱謂徽菌庖廚之化騐室，卽專爲配製徽菌所需而應栽種於其上之各質料，（卽馬鈴　牛胆液等）者是也，此外尚有最能引起人之興趣者，卽爲搜集之各類菌苗，其中每一類皆標有其歷史之說明，該處有大櫉一架，分爲三格，其中收藏菌苗多至六百本，（自人類菌苗以至於牛類鳥類及腐草類各種菌苗）論其式樣則同，論其功用則異，今若照每格約貯一千二百管之數計算，而每管所盛之微生物，多至無算，（卽以三百萬萬或四百萬萬之數稱之亦不能喻其多）則當吾人注視此菌苗櫉門之時，不免油然而起敬心焉，今吾人暫不駐留於十大定温暖室及建設於屋頂之化學治療化騐室等處。而迅速參觀動物飼養所。該處所有之小獸。多至八千頭。皆飼養於樓上下之二大室中。盛以帶有鐵鋼之鉛皮箱。而每箱皆有號碼及活動樑籤。（上書天竺鼠兎大小鼠等名）至於綿羊山羊等。則另　他室。此外尚有畜猴之所。共有猴子二百隻。（本報五年前曾久談及之）又有鷄塲一在近屋頂處。畜鷄二百頭。其爲試騐所用。一如天竺鼠無異。凡各死獸或被犧牲之獸。其屍體剖解室設有二處。其一專爲視察曾受Ｂ.Ｃ.Ｇ.之各獸所用，其二則專爲視察曾充作各種結核病研究試騐之獸所用，今余巳叙述至參觀之末節，而余所得之主要感象，則爲驚賞讚歎，惟吾法人有時因喜自貶之故，固亦曾宣揚吾國化騐室之陋，甚至計及破窗若干扇，破桌若干張，朽廢器械若干件，試問吾人果近於情乎，以事實而言，自數年以來，巳有極大之進步，實現於法國之各地點，例如巴黎大學醫學院之育兒學校，法國研究院之各新化騐，所以及Ｂligny，Ainccurt與Ｈelfaut等處之各大療養院，今巳見增多矣，今日法國之科學家已非如神話中之寒酸人物，且其需用之器械，亦已製造精良，爲今之計，亟應將各該科學家之發明，推廣而實用之，蓋尚有多數醫士及民衆，對於B.C.G.仍懷十年以前之舊觀念，豈知預防注射，止限於有病家庭中之孩童，此爲過去時代之事，今則全體法國人其中尤以巳達入塾年歳之孩童爲先，（祇須合乎能受種苗之條件）皆應享用此種發明，蓋自巴斯德之大時期以來，當不愧稱爲最神妙之發明也。（完）</p>

<h3>中英擊彈李公頴打頭陣</h3>
<p>英國包特軍首當其能</p>
<p>今日下午五時半開始</p>
<p>醖釀巳久之第二屆中英國際擊彈賽、今日下午五時半在北京路二七號聯華總會内上海業餘擊彈會開始比賽、我國彈王李公頴打頭陣、英國包特耳則首當其衝、競賽目的七百五十點、約一小時半卽可了局、入塲劵每人一元、各將出馬、觀者勢必雲集、屆時或有人滿之患、</p>
<h3>過去成績</h3>
<p>上海之有中英國際擊彈賽始於去年三月間、上海業餘擊彈會主持其事、彼時中華隊勝英國隊共八三四點得第一屆錦標、中華代表李公頴、沈林策·張英達·劉富宗·徐世璋五傑、英國由名宿貝納爾領導、麥雪爾·聶馬·培克爾及馬克斯爲副將、先後五戰、中華四勝一負、獲最後勝利、</p>
<h3>本屆實力</h3>
<p>中華陣綫仍與今年相同而實力則較往年雄厚、彈王李公頴在最近與世界擊彈家史密斯表演時、尤有顯著之進步、今日克敵致勝、意中事耳、其餘若老將嚴林策、經騐過人、劉富宗徐世璋張英達等技藝佳妙、第二屆錦標大有聯袂希望、</p>
<h3>英國陣容</h3>
<p>英國代表五人多半更動、名宿貝納爾之缺席、實予英國隊極大之損失、新將若包特耳、聶珂耳、格令等亦屬一時之選、究其實力、較去年未見長進、但臨陣應戰之際、苟能謹愼從事、則其形勢或可平衡耳、</p>

<h3>運命</h3>
<p>— 倪朔爾</p>
<p>電影『「姊妹花」中的窮老太婆對她的窮女兒說：「窮人終是窮人，你要忍耐些！」』宗漢先生慨然指出，名之曰『窮人哲學』。</p>
<p>自然，這是敎人安貧的，那根據是『運命』。古今聖賢的主張此說者巳經不在少數了，但是不安貧的窮人也『終是』很不少。『智者千慮，必有一失』，這里的『失』，是在非到蓋棺之後，一個人的運命『終是』不可知。</p>
<p>豫言運命者也未嘗没有人，看相的，排八字的，到處都是。然而他們對於主顧，肯斷定他窮到底的是很少的，卽使有，大家的學說又不能相一致，甲說當窮，乙却說當富，這就使窮人不能確信他將來的一定的運命。</p>
<p>不信運命，就不能『安分』，窮人買奬劵，便是一種『非分之想』。但這於國家，現在是不能說没有益處的。不過『有一利必有一弊』，運命旣然不可知，窮人又何妨想做皇帝，這就使中國出現了『推背圖』。據宋人說，五代時候，許多人都看了這圖給自己的兒子取名字，希望應着將來的吉兆，直到宋太宗（？）抽亂了一百本，與别本一同流通，讀者見次序多不相同，莫衷一是，這才不再珍藏了。然而九一八那時，上海却還大賣着『推背圖』的新印本。</p>
<p>『安貧』誠然是天下太平的要道，但倘使無法指定究竟的運命，總不能令人死心塌地。現在的優生學，本可以說是科學的了，中國也正有人提倡着，冀以濟運命說之窮，而歷史又偏偏不掙氣，漢高祖的父親並非皇帝，李白的兒子也不是詩人；還有立志傳，絮絮叨叨的在對人講西洋的誰以冒險成功，誰又以空手致富。</p>
<p>運使說之毫不足以治國平天下，是有明明白白的履歷的。倘若還要用牠來做工具，那中國的運命可眞要『窮』極無聊了。</p>
<h3>關於我的創作</h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>一禮拜以前，有個朋友告訴我說，某刊物上有位清道夫先生駡我，說我是「海派」後起之秀，所有小說全是徐轉逢和陳福熙二君做的。在上海，駡人原不算一回大事，自己似乎也已經被駡過幾次，却從來没有什麽聲明，也不打算辯護，可是這次却使我不能再緘默了。</p>
<p>事實是很明顯的，我的作風和他們兩位的作風完全不同。一個作家的風格，同他的個性很有關係，是大家承認的事實。我的氣量很狹窄，行動很拘謹，什麽事情全喜歡追根究底、條分縷析，就是極小的地方也不肯輕易放鬆。這種守舊的，也許是落後的脾氣，很明顯地反映在我的作品上面。雖則不能十分機械的說，但就大體看起來，我的作品都有下列的幾個特點：（一）布局嚴緊（二）描寫細膩（三）用字造句非常的愼重。我最愛心理描寫，風景描寫，自己比較滿意的也是這兩項。徐陳二君的作品，却完全同我相反，他們寫得比較的簡潔，我所注意着重的幾點，他們却是一向不重視的。我喜歡曲折，他們却愛直爽，我喜歡濃艷，他們却愛清淡。這種筆調上技巧上的不同，只要看看我們的作品，稍一比較就可明白的。至於内容，我們也差得遠，我的取材往往是很瑣碎的，很平凡的故事，多少都帶點哲學的意味，有的時候却完全是鄉村的，富有詩意的羅曼司，同他們所應用的材料絕對兩樣。而且我的大多數作品都用第一人稱，愛把故事烘托成温暖而且熱烈，他們却始終一貫的都是用的第三人稱，冷淡而且撲素的，有點像自然主義的筆法，讀者只要讀過我們的作品，就能很容易的辨出這個差異。</p>
<p>我寫作一向老實，苟且取巧的事，從來不願嘗試。我同徐陳二君雖是好朋友，文章私相授受的勾當，却是絕對没有的。「老婆人家的美，文章自己的好」，誰願把自己的得意之作贈送親友？我並不否認上海有名作家收買無名作家的文章這件事實，可是我並不是左右逢源的有名文士，他們也不是到處碰壁的無名作家，我那曾收買他們的稿子？徐君近來各雜誌都發表他的文章，陳君在光華光明巳經出了好幾個集子，雖道他們會愁没有出路嗎？</p>
<p>我寫文章很仔細，一連勝清過幾遍的小說都有，就連短短的散文，我也毫不放鬆的，一個個字，一句句的斟酌修改，草率應付的時候，雖則也有，却並不多。譬如我自己比較滿意，也比較受人稱讚的幾篇：貓·湖上·雨天·車水·出獄以及再滑進了車輪，都是經過幾次删改的。</p>
<p>清道夫先生要用他的「春秋之筆」肅清文壇，勇敢與精明，都是值得佩服的，可是他没有舉出證據，而且又不用眞名，未免有造謡之嫌。這種造謡誣衊的行爲，怕眞是「海派」的技倆吧。</p>
<h3>「經濟獨立」</h3>
<p>— 樨玉女士</p>
<p>在中學還没有畢業的時候，我常常這樣幻想：將來畢業後，怎樣去找個職業，使經濟獨立起來，免得去受男子的氣。是的，畢業了。一鑽到社會裏面去看，所有的職業都不是我們女子所能做的；呵，原來我們所學的全不能用！但是，爲了要貫澈我的「經濟獨立」的思想，我還是盡量去「碰」；可是碰到東聽見經濟恐慌，碰到西聽見失業恐慌，何况我僅是一個中學畢業的女子！忽然有一個好消息了：Ｘ公司開除了十幾個要求加薪而罷工的男職員，改招女的補充。我是在家裏悶坐了一年多了，那裏肯放鬆這個機會。雖是聽見說女職員的薪水要比被開除的男職員的少一半，然而我還是感覺得非常的愉快和滿足！</p>
<p>一同考進來的女同事，都很温柔地常常對我微笑；可是我却有點瞧她們不起：她們講究打扮，臉白，嘴紅，髮燙得像獅子頭，帮助肉的誘惑的香水，從她們的身上散滿全辦公室，引得那些男同事們常常動着鼻子在空氣中探來探去。不過她們旣能够從閨中跑出來做職員，總算是比較進步的女子了。我有時又這樣想。</p>
<p>男同事當然有點嫉妒我們，因爲這回我們的進來不但是破壞了他們加薪的要求，而且以後他們的飯锰更加不牢了丨丨經理是可以隨時再招些女的來代替他們的。可是因爲我們是「女的」，他們終於也很開心，恭聽了經理的吩咐，耐煩地來指導我們抄這個，做那個。</p>
<p>至於經理呢，對於我們是特别優待：在我們的坐位旁邊，特别放一座熱烘烘的電爐；每逢下午，常呌茶房送點心來給我們吃。他的頭髮是特别油光光的，常常站在我們的身邊，指導這樣，視察那樣。找機會跟我們談話，或者嘻嘻哈哈地爭論着，什麽電影囉，怎樣跳舞囉等等。有回甚至於「呌」我們去赴他家的茶舞會，而且還「帶」我們去看電影。</p>
<p>當然囉，第二天就聽見男同事們從鼻子裏笑出來的聲音。</p>
<p>我們本來每天到晚上五時就可以回家了。可是男同事們都下了辦公室的時候，而那些女同事還在埋着頭做自己的。我自己要一個人走，又覺得太難爲情；可是一等，總是等到一兩個鐘頭以上，等大家都把公司裏的一切弄清楚了才擦好各人的粉走出去。因此經理就當衆稱贊我們了。可是這稱贊更激起了那些男同事們的憤恨。</p>
<p>「爛貨」，「狐狸精」，只要經理一轉身，這些齷齪的名詞就從男同事那邊傳過來了。我瞧一瞧那些女同事們，她們都紅着臉，低着頭，一聲不響地做着自己的事。</p>
<p>「呵，這呌做經濟獨立！」</p>
<p>當我憤憤地離開公司的時候，不知誰又在我的後面擲來一句：</p>
<p>「花瓶！」</p>
<h3>在廣州過新年</h3>
<p>— 味荔</p>
<p>ＸＸ：</p>
<p>朋友，我眞想不到今年會在廣州過新年！</p>
<p>記得去年這時候，我們恰住在法國聖蒂勒尼山上。除夕的晚上，我們幾個朋友約好了到老沈家裏燒雞吃，喝酒，打牌，直鬧到天亮。我們正鬧得興高彩烈，你說：「明年我們不知道在什麽地方過年」？「我一定在家裏」，我這樣堅决地回答你，誰知道今年又在異鄉過新年！十二個年頭没有回家過年，你想這是多麽不幸的事情！</p>
<p>說起來這是第二次過新年，因爲我們巳經過了一個陽曆年。不過陽曆年祗是官廳掛一掛旗，小百姓仍舊是隂曆年底過年，丨憑你怎樣說隂曆早已降爲「廢曆」。幾千年來相沿的舊習慣，却不是一紙命令可以革除的。話雖這樣說，學校强迫上課，小學生們没有工夫跑出來玩，這對於新年自然减色不少，再加今年廣州市的不景氣，過年那裏比得上往年那麽熱鬧？然而在我們「外江人」看起來，廣州過年到底熱鬧，比我們家鄉確實熱鬧多了。</p>
<p>最有趣的是花市。從舊曆十二月二十四五起，大街兩旁擺著許多花攤，出賣鮮花。我們家鄉過新年家家户户插萬年青柏，廣東人喜歡供鮮花，這一點可見廣州市洋化程度比我們内地小城市進步多了。花攤有的是特别搭起來的，是一個一層一層的木架，每層擺着許多小花盆；有的不用花盆，賣花的人將折下來的花枝揷在瓶裏，各色各樣的瓶子都有，從紹興酒罎到西藥房的玻璃瓶。這條車如流水馬如龍的永漢北路忽然變成一個美麗的花園，含苞未放的牡丹和各色玫瑰，洋菊，山茶，金橘，墨蘭，什麽都有，但是紅梅，水仙，「吊鐘花」最多。有些花枝站在那裏比人還要高，是從樹的主幹上斫下來的，上面掛着許多嫩蕊。</p>
<p>花市不只賣花，别的做小生意的也利用這個機會賺幾個錢過年。有幾處賣古董的攤子，夾七雜八的堆着些舊貨，比北平廠甸廟會所陳列的古董實在差得太遠，所以有錢的主顧們走到這些攤子傍邊瞧都不瞧就走過了。賣花瓶的也有，地上擺着許多花瓶，個個「古色古香」，可是時代恐怕是民國二十二年。聽說廣州附近有一個地方是專製造古瓶的。其次是賣「利是封」的孩子，花一毛錢可以買三四束這種泥金印的小紅封袋丨這是新年包賞錢用的。賣曆書的也不少，這自然指「廢曆」，因爲普通日曆是各大書坊的專利品，做小買賣的是没有份的。</p>
<p>從十二月廿四五起，街上來往的人就多起來了。他們許多是來白瞧的，「老廣東」總等到三十晚才買花，因爲花攤趕着收塲價錢便宜些。三十晚上我一吃完飯就跑到街上去。滿街是人，兩旁走道上擁擠得不堪，街心游人也不少，汽車嗚嗚地呌，一步也開不動，廣東人這時候都來買花了。這裏一位摩登女郎手裏托着一盆含苞未放的水仙花；那裏一位老頭子手中執着一枝硃砂梅；有許多人買「吊鐘花」，開出來滿枝花朶多麽好看！我走了半條永漢馬路足足費去半點鐘工夫，這使我想起兒時在家鄉三月三看「花祭」。中國人愛看熱鬧到處是一樣的。</p>
<p>正月初一清早起來跑到街上去，靜悄悄的，滿地是砲仗紙，廣東人本來愛放砲，過新年更要放個痛快。馬路兩旁的店舖有的門關着，門上貼着「七星拱照，喜鵲臨門」的紅紙字條，有的門半開半掩，我們看見裏面有人打牌。一羣野孩子圍着一個賣玩具的擔子。賣輕氣球的忙忙地把玻璃瓶裝置起來，幾滴硫酸，三四張鋅片，一會兒那個橡皮袋漸漸地大起來，在旁邊看的人都覺得驚奇。街上到處呌着「賣紅猪」，泥做的撲滿，這是利市貨，買牠可以發財。還有賣蚶的人挑着擔子沿家挨户賣，廣東人過年吃蚶，好像意大利人過聖誕節吃鰻魚一樣。我們家鄉雖然也在海邊，可是没有這樣的風俗。</p>
<p>至於廣東人在家裏怎樣過年，明年如果我還在這裏，那時候再告訴你罷。</p>

<h3>日米施行統制之後</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>日本米穀統制法之實施，本刊第四十七期上業巳陳其概略。其效果如何？當爲我國留心食糧問題者所關心。爰就去年十一月以後，日政府處置米穀之狀况，與其增損變遷，略述經過，大可供吾人高談統制糧食者之借鑑也。</p>
<p>日本頒布米穀統制法以來，卽經農林拓務兩省於去年十二月六日，舉行米穀顧問委員會，又與大藏省恊議進行方針。貯穀案卽告成立，合日本内地殖民地貯穀一千萬名，綱爲（甲）日本内地，（一）内地貯藏本年度産穀六百萬石，但依時之情况，得繼續貯藏，卽九年産新穀，亦得貯藏，（二）對貯穀撥給奬勵金，（三）除奬勵金外，得行低利資金融通。（四）貯藏期間爲一年，至明年秋季爲止，其處分採許可主義，（五）雖經過一年，然米價不達相當額時，不許賣却，（六）爲貯穀計，全國建設國營倉庫四百五十所，免費保管，倉庫之收容力，能容十萬石者十所，容五萬石者四十所，容五千石以下、　石以上者千零四所，（七）又以十町村爲單位，設立小倉庫，由地主負擔，在全國建設一千所，爲備荒之用。（乙）殖民地，（一）朝鮮貯三百萬石，臺灣貯百萬石，（二）政府交給奬勵金，（三）得以低資融通，（四）貯藏期間，爲相當的長期間，亦採許可處分主義，（五）在朝鮮臺灣，亦新設各種倉庫，（五）朝鮮自預備期着手，臺灣自本年第一期作實施。</p>
<p>至於日本内地貯穀六百萬石之辦法，又經全國各道府縣内務部長會議之結果，（甲）實施要綱，（一）在昭和八年内地産穀約六百萬石，凡農家以自治的貯藏之，（二）政府適應地方之狀况，使道府縣市町村産業組合農會等，保管貯穀，（三）對於貯穀，按照米穀貯藏奬勵規則，考慮利息保管費運費等項，交給相當之助成金，（四）貯穀如未騰貴至米價最低價格一成半以上，不得出售，（五）昭和九年（明年）四月以後，認爲貯穀保管之必要時，適應地方之實情，建設貯藏倉庫，又對於借入者，得交付補助金，（六）前項穀之保管爲免費，但須補助手續費之一部，（七）至米穀年度末之間，不得出售貯穀，但自貯穀開始後，對於發生損傷减量變質及陳米等處分，得付一定金額之補助金，（八）各道府縣之巡視監督費，交付一定金額之補助金，（九）各府縣之貯穀數量比例，卽就六百萬石中分配之。（乙）貯穀辦法，（一）須精選穀種，除去夾雜穀中之物，（二）須烘晒乾燥，宜於長期貯藏，但在不易十分乾燥地方，除可及的設法乾燥外，應注意其狀態，（三）具備第一第二要件之穀，大體設三級之標凖穀，標凖穀之分類，依各道府縣而定之，並就其品種，區别價格，（四）貯藏方法，以可能的混合保管，但須考慮穀之乾燥程度，與地方之習慣，以及其他情况，選定袋包或散積，如用包裝時，應用蔴袋或蒲包，（五）穀之處理，依照重量，其重量須除去包裝物，力謀可能的統一。</p>
<p>日本農林省調查本年度（昭和八年度）米之收穫數，比前年度增加五百五十七萬三千三百三十二石，又比前五年，增加五百四十九萬五千九十四石，約在六千六百萬石。</p>
<p>昭和三年　六○、三○三、○八九</p>
<p>昭和四年　五九、五五七、六九四</p>
<p>昭和五年　六六、八七五、五三五</p>
<p>昭和六年　五五、二一五、二六三</p>
<p>昭和七年　六○、三九○、○九八</p>
<p>五年平均　六○、四六八、三三六</p>
<p>米貯穀之收穫數旣有定數，卽以此數推算昭和九年，及（明年）之需供狀况，至青黄不接時期，存米當在千六百萬石以上，故本年度米穀有過剩之虞，一方面旣欲取買，以維持穀價，公定價格雖經擬定，仍難恰當，關鍵仍在米穀生産費之多寡，據倉敷市農會所調查，米穀之生産費有如下列，（甲）收入方面，糙米三石爲六六元，碎米一斗八角，稻草一四零貫（約當我國九百八十斤）三元三角六分，穀殼百四十斤三角，副收入四元四角六角，合計七十元四角七分。（乙）支出方面，直接生産費二十七元三角五分；内分種子費三升爲三角九分，肥料爲七元一角六分，勞需十五人三分，爲十六元八角，各種材料費約一元，畜力費二元，間接生産費爲三十七元六角八分，内分農具費二元三角，建造物費一元二角半，各税四元六角六分，土地資本利子二十九元四角六分，合計爲六十五元零三分，收支相抵，盈餘五元四角，卽一石之生産實費爲二十一元六角八分，而一石之賣價爲二十五元四角九分，但照暫定最低價格爲二十二元七角，不過一元二分之利益。又照農會之計算，在八百六十户農家中，每石生産費，除不滿十八元與在三十三元以上者八十二户外，其他七百八十八户之生産費，對於直接生産費爲四元四角八分，間接生産費爲三元三角二分，合計七元八角，就一石而言爲二十五元二角一分。於是米穀統制委員會，决定公定價格如下，（一）標凖最高價格爲三十元五角，（二）標凖最低價格爲二十三元三角。但帝國農會與政黨方面，頗爲不滿，政友會之意，主張最低價格應提高二十五元，農會方面以最低米價，自作農每石之生産費爲二十三元七角三分，外加運費雜用一元四角八分，應在二十五元二角一分，故須提高至此數以上，其後卒照原案通過。先是在統制法施行之初，農家皆觀望不前，幾無人敢賣出。逮第二次收穫量發表，比第一次多二十七萬石，（六千五百九十六萬石）物價指數，又漸低落，而政府之季節的買進，爲期又遲，加以受新米之壓迫，米價漸有低落之勢。蓋以日本内地收穫已有六千五百九十六萬三千石，台灣朝鮮米之輸入，爲一千三百萬石，又加現在存貨九百萬七千石，合計達八千七百九十七萬石，至明年青黄不接時期，除去消費量七千一百五十四萬石，（以人口六千六百八十六萬及每人每年消費量。日量一石零六升計算）所餘在一千萬石以上。故自米穀統制委員會議决提高暫定價格六角後，各處向政府聲請賣出米穀，突然增加。聞自十二月二十日至二十一日，竟達八十二萬六千六百十五袋，卽三十三萬石，且農家深恐不能維持二十三元之價，賣出者蜂擁而至，計自統制法施行後，聲請之總數，竟達百三十三萬石，遂致政府無法應付。加以去年年終，農家急於得金，賣出之數量，益爲增加。照例年每屆年終，每月賣出者，平均在十萬石左右，自統計法公布後，因米價日形軟調，農民咸抱悲觀，故賣出之聲請尤難防遏耳。其他如朝鮮米之輸入日本，亦比往年爲多。昭和七年度，朝鮮米之輸入爲七百五十萬三千石，本年約增三十萬石，而東京市塲，巳由二十四元落至二十三元七角半。去年十一月最高價格爲二十四元九角七分，未及一月，突然暴落一元二角三分。大約三月底米之聲請賣出，當在二百萬石之下。然而日政府，旣無無限之資金，又無倉庫之設備，因此政府爲維持統制法與救濟農村，不得不勉强應付，此猶就去年年底情形言之也。</p>
<p>日本厲行米穀統制，旣經米穀委員員之討論，復得顧問會議之同意，而規定日本内地貯穀六百萬石，朝鮮三百萬石，台灣百萬石，又有資金爲之融通，在貯藏期間之利息及貯藏倉庫之運費，撥給奬勵金，並得免費保管，全國各地建設倉庫一千四百五十所貯藏倉庫之建設，初時採都市集中主義，收容力十萬石之大倉庫，在全國各府縣建設六十所。其後參酌各方面之意見，提出于顧問會議之貯藏奬勵案，併用集中分散主義，在中心大都市建設收容力十萬石之倉庫十所，中小都市建設收容力五萬石之倉庫四十所，全國村鎭建設收容力五千石以下一千石以上之小倉庫千四百所，此等倉庫，悉由政府建設。農家之穀，皆應寄託於政府之貯藏倉庫保管。在政府以爲由農家自身利用産業組合或貯穀組合，建設鄉村部落之小規模倉庫，以自治方法管理者，必不能完全妥當，不如由政府經營，比較可以統一也，但其最大缺點，卽對于貯穀，如不騰貴至標凖最低價格一成五分以上，不許賣却，設至米穀年度之末，如無賣却之機會，政府對于貯穀者，不得不補償損害變質之費，因此而增國庫之負担。且所有貯穀，因悉由政府管理，不任農家自治管理，妨碍農村自主的精神。故日本政友會，主張貯穀制度，參酌往時之鄉藏制度，（義倉）依鄰保互助之精神，以鄉村與部落爲單位，組織貯穀組合，俾得備荒共濟與供給調節之作用；同時分爲義務貯藏與任意貯藏兩種，又可期農民自治貯藏制度之發展。卒遭農林省之反對，仍照原案施行。不意日本大藏省將農林省之預算數額减半，他方對于地主自作農佃户等階級之利害關係，由貯穀之立塲，又有差别待遇。因此而責難紛起。據一月十三日，東京時事新報所載，全國農家通知米穀賣出數量，已達三百八十萬石。如至舊歷年終，每日必有二三十萬石之賣出，農林省預料今年米穀年度内，不得不增加至八百萬石。然而米穀需給調節特别會計之資金餘力四億二千萬元，照買進數量之最大限度，每年不過六百萬石，故以目下之情勢而言，巳達兩年度之數量。統制法之效力，殆巳呈危迫之狀。且米穀之最低價格，仍不能照原則維持，政府財政的破减，愈形窮竭。及本年日本議會開會，議員卽追詰有無對策以善其後。而日米收穫，復超越預計有七千萬石之巨額，米價乃有不能維持之勢，政府亦感米穀財政不能應付此種局面。議會旣經責問，若不另籌彌補，政黨方面，勢必另提農村米穀對策，迫政府以實行。於是後籐農相與齋籐首相商議之結果，决擬提出新對策，（一）增加米穀部運用資金，以應付農民之出賣（二）切實管理朝鮮台灣兩殖民地之米（三）修改現行米穀統制法。（四）决取海外傾銷政策，將所剩米糧一千萬餘石中，先運一千萬餘石，在中國長江一帶及華北各商埠削價傾銷，其損失則由政府塡補。又使台灣政府將其蓬萊米，運五十萬石在廣東福建兩省各重要商埠傾銷，其損失由台灣農民及台灣政府均分塡補。至前述（二）（三）兩項之實行方法，據二月四日華聯社東京電訊所傳，似巳證實。台鮮農民，旣爲亡國之民，固無往而不受犧牲。終爲日本人民之爼上肉，而我中國農民，亦以國弱無抵抗之故，同蒙池魚之殃，受日米傾銷之害，不亦大可哀哉！兹將華聯電訊附後，</p>
<p>日政府因米穀豐收，地主及佃户生活萬分困難，决犧牲台灣及朝鮮兩殖民地之民衆，爲日本國地主佃户造福。甚堅决改變其米穀政策，則聽政民兩黨之要求修改米穀統制法，其目的在於阻止台灣與朝鮮兩殖民地米運日，與日米競爭，致使日米市價跌落，藉以維持日米市價，卽維持公定價格，避免農民起摇動，殖民地米管理問題，由農拓兩省與兩殖民地政府洽商中。惟兩政府因恐增加被統治民族之反抗，對本國之要求仍不同意，力爭管理方法，减輕與犧牲之程度。惟後藤農相堅决代表統治民族之利益，决於六日之閣議，提出殖民地米管理案及米穀修改案，使閣議通過，然後迫兩殖民地政府承認。聞農相之對策，爲（一）殖民米歸政府管理，（二）殖民地削减米穀之生産量，提倡改種雜穀，（三）殖民地米出口特許制，（四）殖民地施行特别米穀等，四案中擇一施行云，</p>
<p>上述對策，雖以後籐農相患病之故，尚未提出於議會，尚不致立見實行。但日人之爲政，恒有避名就實之策略，或竟以閣議之結果，先付實行，避免人耳目者。蓋日米豐收，已成事實，（台鮮在内）豐收爲災，亦爲日本朝野一致之見。日政府如欲保全日農生計，惟有將餘剩之米，或一時困於財力不能儲藏之米，照前述之辦法，爲之接受。接受之後：如果來者不拒，財力必有時而乏，拒則農民之暴動起，政府有崩潰之虞，是惟有海外傾銷，以圖宣洩也。環顧世界傾銷最便之國，莫如中國。中國雖稱米賤，而其原因，爲豐收歟！爲調節不匀歟！爲民窮財盡之故歟！此其中頗爲複雜，恐非日本米賤原因之簡單。况日本在華有租界爲之隱藏，有海軍爲之掩護，傾銷客有損失，政府已决心塡補，則來華傾銷，不過時間之問題而巳。</p>
<p>照目下米價，日米來華推銷，若有其不可能，則以所虧太鉅，而不念台米之價如何？至以日米傾銷之說，爲日本之反宣傳，以出爲進，是又無殊痴人說夢欲蓋彌彰也。日米除非取銷其傾銷辦法，否則終以中國爲目標。其必先注重於華南，華南又以閩便於粤，閩與台灣接壤，台米向爲閩省民食所資以挹注也。其次則爲粤，民國十九年日米來滬傾銷，爲滬人所阻，轉而之港以入粤，其前車也。又其次莫若津，津則有關税，競爭較不易。長江一帶，爲産米之區，原無推銷可有，然若米價上漲至十餘元時，台米恐早列於本米之中矣。目前無可奈何之抵制策，惟有促閩粤兩省遇洋米進口一律照海關税則徵税，或可稍殺其勢，然仍恐不能收全效也。</p>
<h3>普通支票與限額支票利弊之比較</h3>
<p>— 潘恒勤</p>
<p>關於限額支票一事，不佞嘗自忘其譾陋，一再爲文刊佈報端。蓋此項支票，直接旣可避免空頭及塗改支票之弊，間接復有促進票據流通之可能，雖未可謂爲如何法良意美，但值兹票據流通不廣，社會欺詐百出之際，亦未嘗不值得研究與提倡者焉。時賢間有以限額支票，如限額過高，仍難免塗改；並認爲祇適用於小額存户者。鄙意以爲限額過高，雖仍難免塗改等情弊，但較諸未有限額者，究屬稍勝一籌，似未可因噎而廢食。至限額支票之倡用，雖係爲信用薄弱之存户而起，但事實上之應用，初不必限於信用薄弱之存户，卽商業往來，亦未嘗不適用之，惟可以存户自願領用爲原則耳。惟存户開發支票時之心理，莫不希望其支票之爲人信任，易於流通；至收欵人方面之心理，亦莫不希望其所收得之支票確實可靠，顧能有此功效者，除與大銀行往來者容或有之外，限額支票，庶幾具備之。蓋限額支票，由銀行按照存額，發給存户，實含有保證性質，流通愈廣，往來愈便，换言之，限額支票之受授間，退票較少，而普通支票之受授間，退票較多，縱使開發限額支票，手續上容或較諸開發普通支票，稍爲繁重，但商家心理，最重信用，而手續次之，設使發票雖須稍費手續，而能增强其票據之信用者，當亦不辭手續之繁而爲人通常支票上有加蓋祈换本票字樣之圖章者，卽其一例也。且手續之便利與否，旣係比較的，而非絕對的，且完全習慣關係，行之旣久，卽可不成問題，要在銀行之善爲因勢利導而已。兹將普通支票與限額支票利弊之比較，列表分析如下，以資研究。</p>
<p>普通支票　　　　　　　　限額支票</p>
<p>發　利　數目塡發自由　　（一）收欵人因此項支票有保證性質收取較安心歡迎接受（二）不易發生塗改</p>
<p>票　弊　（一）收欵人恐有空頭支票未必歡迎（二）容易發生塗改　數目塡發有限制</p>
<p>人</p>
<p>銀　利　發給存户支票手續簡單　不致誤付空頭或塗改支票</p>
<p>行　弊　防誤付空頭或塗改支票　發給存户支票手續較繁</p>
<p>收　利　　　　　　　　　　　　除發票人印鑑不符或遺失外不致發生空頭塗改</p>
<p>欵　弊　除發票人印鑑不符或遺失外並恐有空頭或塗改</p>
<p>人</p>
<p>以上所云利弊已明，再則普通支票遇有水火盜竊遺失，固可掛失，但限額支票，因在外流通性較久，在未組銀行兌付之時，發票人在利息上比較行使普通支票尤爲有利也。</p>

<p>ＸＸ　　ＸＸ　　　　ＸＸ</p>
<p>總觀上列各縣，可知現在農村中捐税之繁重。分析言之，則可得下面幾個現像：</p>
<p>（一）名目繁多，如列舉之，每縣可達四十種以上。</p>
<p>（二）附加多，幾每税必附加，而附加之種類又極錯雜。</p>
<p>（三）雜税多，所謂紳富捐，保甲捐等等，在近年來，特别的增加。</p>
<p>（四）徵收機關多，卽如羅田的徵收機關，總在四五種以上。</p>
<p>（五）中飽多，税多，徵收機關多，則中飽必多，尤其是雜税及臨時攤派，實爲土劣發財之機會。</p>
<p>（六）消耗多，而用於生産方面者絕少，卽慈善公益費，亦屬罕見，大都爲政費保安費。</p>
<p>農村中捐税旣如此繁重，農村復捐之高調，實在唱得太遠了，希望當局者留意及乏。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>新書論斤賣</h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>上海某書局大廉價，新書三斤半賣洋一塊錢，不論新書的内容價值如何，好的壞的，成名作家的，無名作家的，一攏捆將起來，以紙的重量言價，正如小菜塲賣魚賣菜一樣，論斤計錢。這一新聞已經够耐人尋味的了，某書局過年把新出版的文學書以五元一担的代價批給同行，同行買了還說是看他們老板的面子。新書業的不景氣，連同文化學術的價值都慘落千丈！嗚呼！</p>
<p>一本新書的出版，先經過作家的絞盡腦汁，思維計劃，然後寫將出來，其次排字印刷工人幾次麻煩地印出，這其間光是化了人的精力也就不少，便說是那新書没有什麽價值吧，也不應該以紙的重量來論斤賣錢。而且有的紙價也不止三斤半重量值洋一元，或一担值洋五元，這一新書市價眞是給作家們以一種吞了冷氣的感覺的了。</p>
<p>文人除帮治者外，賣文爲生的人，正是給社會上看成文丐，自己雖然以爲清高，在社會上的地位却是下等又下等，現在文人的新書論斤賣，名利兩虧，嗚呼文人的末路也就到了！</p>
<p>文章自古不值錢，。詩歌稱爲「雕虫小技」，小說指作「街談巷議」，古人著書所以都用别號筆名，現在作家們自己抬高聲價，其實在這一切都高品化的現社會上，市塲不景氣的影響，作家的作品也就難免碰到了不值錢的際遇了，這所以難怪詩人朱湘投水自殺。</p>
<p>新書論斤賣，影饗所及，我敢預言：自今而後定有不少的作家步朱湘的後塵。經濟迫人本來已經足以收拾人命的了，何况現實的社會環境是給人在精神上以無限沉悶與苦痛的呢？</p>
<h3>我想到他</h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>我記得没有和他認識之先，我倒在無意中中傷了他，爲的Ｔ朋友邀我到新光去，Ｔ君也是他的朋友，所以不約的就和他在一個戲院裏看戲，那天的片子是一張武俠的片子，没有多大的意義，不過片裏有一隻很猛的獅子，又像是豹，當我們從戲院跑出來的時候，Ｔ君很自信的敎我猜，他說：</p>
<p>「你知道她是獅子還是豹呢」？我回答他是豹，他說我完全看錯了，那不過是母獅，她的形象很像豹，我偏說：「儍子！那不明明是豹嗎？」Ｔ君更不服氣，祗得找第三者來證明，第三者除了那蒙之外就無别人，當時那蒙也是同Ｔ君一樣回答說是獅子，這一來眞把我氣壞，我趕快搶住說：「他也是儍子」！他因爲和我不相識，他雖然給我白白的駡了一聲，他也不好說什麽，我也没有想到說了那麽普通一句話却開罪了他，事實我駡人家儍子並不是惡意或者瞧不起人家，有時候我對於可愛的人，我也每每愛喊他一聲儍子，那蒙和我認識以後，他在我的心目中並不儍，而事實他也不是儍，但我曾經好幾次呌他儍子，有一次他很不高興，他要發氣，正爲着我這樣稱呼他，我對他說：「你本並不儍，但是現在却眞的儍了，我這樣喊你難道你就眞會儍了嗎？眞是儍子！</p>
<p>那蒙他本來很不想和我相識，有一天他在外邊聽到人家說我住的地方很不好，房東是個壞人，對於我很不方便，想勸我搬開那個地方，因爲這個緣故，他想通知我，於是他不得不跑到我的住處來認識我，就這樣的我和他開始相識，開始交談，照這種情形來看，他來認識我的動機可以說是非常簡單。</p>
<p>此後，我們會見是很不足爲奇，不過男女間的一種隔膜是不能免的，這不是封建思想的關係，我自己也很奇怪，我和男性接近的並不少，而他的女朋友也多的不可勝數，我平常對於朋友没有什麽不慣的地方，我心裏愛說的話很任意的什麽都可以說，甚至自己困苦的情形，我不怕别人知道，有時候我的口袋裏祇剩下一個銅子，但我又需要去看一個朋友，那麽我很隨便的向朋友借一角子，我不歡喜掩飾，虚僞，冐裝有錢人，惟有對於那蒙，什麽我也說不出。</p>
<p>日子過了好久，我們的感情還不錯，任何事情我對他也用不着有什麽隱瞞，但我看他是個有錢人，我不願意得到他的帮忙，所以不想他知道我是窮到末路，可是有一次他要求在我家裏吃飯，他要看我自己燒的菜好吃不好吃，照理這是很平常的事情，但我却爲着家裏没有椅子桌子，要請客就有許多不方便，所以我不能答應他，但這小小的要求，因我的堅持不允却引起他的好奇心，他老不客氣的等在我的房間裏。結果弄到午後二點鐘飯還吃不成，没有法子想，我寗願請他到外邊去吃客飯，這樣才算解决了一個午餐，同時他也就因爲一個午餐却給他觀察了許多他從没有曉得的關於我的生活的情形，以後他希望更加明白我多一點，他想了一個辦法就是要求天天在我家裏吃飯，他說他近來很窮，没有錢上飯店去吃，這種令人不相信的說法實在使我煩惱，煩惱的問題不是在乎椅子和桌子，却是在乎没有錢買菜和米了，這一次要瞞也瞞不成了，再也找不出錢來請客飯，而且他要吃的不是一餐兩餐，算了吧！我什麽都可以公開，當時他從褲袋裏拿出唯一的一張鈔票，吩咐房東的用人去换角子，可惜她回來說：「先生，票子用不去呢」！我們接了票子心裏是多麽難過！</p>
<p>在我們的友誼上，不能不自然而然的一天比一天密切起來，他理解我，同情我，我的困難在他腦子裏盤旋，他很眞誠的替我想了幾個安排生活的方法，同時他告訴我他要離開上海，而且時間十分怱促，這個消息傳到我的耳朶之後，雖然暫時在物質的需要上可以解决，但精神方面的確受了很大的創傷，我的心臟忽然冷靜，我的眼睛也好像麻木了。</p>
<p>光隂過得迅速，他决定日期走了，他告訴我，用汽車到我的地方然後一塊上輪船去，可是當日我等到午後一點三刻，還不見他的影子，而輪船决定三點鐘開，我推想到過於傷感，故意不來辭别，當時若是我再耐心等候，那麽我想我將永遠會他不着，於是趕急喊了一輛黄包車直駛到碼頭，合巧他也是剛到，但時候已經不早了，當他的行李安置在房間以後，他握住我的手，他再送我回到碼頭，在半分鐘之間，我們的手要放開了，他的心也許是很急，他竟也很快的在我的口邊送了一個别離的接吻，又像飛似的上船去了，我們就這樣怱怱的離别，我在碼頭站着，等候他的船身在我的眼裏消滅，我用沉重單調的步伐回到家裏，我的心裏還記住他，寂靜！我很怕！……</p>
<h3>和善與隂險</h3>
<p>— 何處去</p>
<p>有人說過最和善的動物就是最可怕的動物。</p>
<p>譬如貓子。當牠蜷伏在你的脚前，牠那綠得發光的瞳子收得祇留一綫縫兒的時候，你用手從牠那「波斯毯」般的柔軟的毛上撫過，你一定會覺得這種動物眞是非常温柔，而從你那指尖處是一定可以得着一種最貼意的温柔之感的。不過你却從没有着想這小巧的東西具有一個很毒的獸心和一種最銳利的爪子。而這爪子却會趁你正以善意摩撫牠的時候，牠會突然地伸出，抓在你的手上，一直陷到那深深的肉裏，使你立刻流起血來。</p>
<p>卽如歷史上一般所謂險毒的政治家或帝國主義者，他們也是没一個不具有這種柔和的外貌的。本來柔和的外貌，最足以掩飾那險毒的用心。因爲吃人的虎狼有時也可以「外婆」一樣的慈和，而最毒的花朶却是嬌艷得異常的。不過這種慈和也卽是種吃人的手段，而那花朶的嬌艷也就是種誘人親近的用心。</p>
<p>如我們爽直者流看來，是吃人的虎狼就坦白地表出是吃人的虎狼，是險毒的政治家們就表出他們是險毒的，這是比那般外貌是慈悲而内心却是隂毒的人們是來得偉大的。譬如張作霖被人家說是馬賊，便坦然地承認是馬賊，這以歷史的眼光看來是比王莽那僞善隂毒者流是來得偉大，並且來得可親的。因爲這是種最坦白的人性發揮，而這發揮的盡緻，却是值得崇尚的。</p>
<p>有時候和一個殺人的兇手以及沉默的僧人同在着，聽着那兇手的滔滔的講說，聽他把他殺人的動機以及他内心所感受的一切全盤地說出來，我們覺得這樣的人不但是没甚可怕，反而是覺得甚爲可親的似地。反而，那沉默的和尚，祇以他那副靜穆的神態對着你，間或也流蕩着一種絕不是眞正的笑的微笑來，我們對着他是很容易覺得這種人們是神秘的，並且最容易滋起懷疑，於是不能免的，我們對於這種人便起着戒懼的。</p>
<p>而這就是一種人性的坦白，和一種人性的隂險。</p>
<p>一點都没不隱瞞自己的心境的人是較那種沉默着，深隱着的人們來得容易打發的。後一種却恰然地反之。或者正因爲是難得被人打發，難得被人參詳，所以這般隂賊的用心者流，就隔外使他的外貌和善異常，而肚子裏却是一肚皮的鬼罷。</p>
<h3>觸霉頭</h3>
<p>— 邨</p>
<p>江浙一帶的人有一句口頭禪「觸霉頭」，人一到觸霉頭的時候總不是好事。俺這一年來觸霉頭的事說也說不清，記也記不起那許多，今天又碰到了一回，眞是越想越晦氣。</p>
<p>靜文要俺和某編輯接洽一樁事說也說了好幾趟，俺總是忘記了，今天到了靜文那裏他又提起來說，「你怎麽不和他去接洽呢？」一時高興便打了電話給他。那位先生說怎麽熟亦不見得，可是也就見了幾次面而且在舞塲也一起玩過，因此俺打電話給他的時候，心想要說的話一說也就可以成功了。不料在電話裏俺很高興地和氣地和他將話說了，他却盛氣地說等和靜文接頭好了！這一句話本來已經是不給面子的了，不料他一說完立刻將電話掛上，連等我說多一句都不，也不說聲再會，這一釘子給俺碰得也就怪可以了，俺從來没有碰過這種釘子的。和靜文說起，他却沉思了一下說，「忘記和你說，前幾天陸珊來電話，說什麽小報造了謡言說她和他結婚，她說是我寫的，我說我從來不看小報，也没有那種閒工夫；她說不是你就是老邨寫的，我說老邨不幹這事，我没有那種朋友。今天大概是因爲這事而給你一</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>個釘子。」！俺眞是觸霉頭，人家的什麽事都派到俺頭上來，俺當時這一氣非同小可，立刻要和他們講個道理去，靜文拉住了俺說，「等我和陸珊打電話去，你急做什麽呢？儍傢伙！」俺離開了靜文那裏回家，越想越生氣，丨俺對他們何等客氣，不料狗咬吕仲賓，不識好人心，如今反而誣陷俺登他們的什麽小報，這年頭交朋友也不是容易的了，到處觸霉頭。</p>
<h3>路路通</h3>
<p>— 里月</p>
<p>廢曆年尾，到一個朋友家裏去吃年夜飯。他家裏的客廳上，除了照例是供着大紅金字燭和天竹臘梅花外，供桌上的兩傍，還臥着兩支二尺多長的大藕。在坐的一位客人就指着桌上的藕向主人是什麽用意，那位朋友解釋着說：這呌做路路通，就是希望明年到處可通，到處可以賺元寳的意思。</p>
<p>路路通。如果用上海話來說，那就是兜得轉。</p>
<p>有人說：在上海灘上没有錢，不要緊。祗要你兜得轉，就可以做事業，做市面。</p>
<p>欠了數百文或數千文的債務者往往打得頭破血淋假定你欠了數十萬或數百萬債務倒反逍遥事外，坐的是汽車，住的是洋房，吃也不要說了，不是山珍海味是什麽？試問他們那裏來有這許多錢，當然他們有他們自己神通廣大的本領。你如果再問這本領是什麽？那告訴你吧，這就呌做兜得轉，也就是路路通。</p>
<p>還有如販運違禁品和偷漏國税的商人，任你國家法律定得多麽嚴，處罰多麽重，可是他們自有巧妙的方法，使得能逃出法網。其他係抵制仇貨，社會輿論是多麽緊，但觀於海關進口統計，仇貨是大增而特增。可知仍是有人在大做而物做。並且還大發其財哩。他們種種的方法和秘訣，當然非兜得轉莫辦。</p>
<p>總之。你如果能兜得轉路路通，無論在那一方面，都可以得到不少的面子，占到不少的便宜。</p>
<p>路路通，路路通，中國的社會，就在路路通裏打圈子。</p>

<h3>幾個法律問題的解答（二）</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個初級中學畢業的青年，並亦習商數年。現思自食其力，擬開設一家小小的百貨商店，店中的職員亦在報上徵求。但不知若在租界内開設此類商店，須登記否？及向何種機關註册？在閘北又是如何？有無書本可以參考？聞友人說開店時，常有流氓，無理索取酒資等情，想先生是指示我們的導師，不至於置之不答吧！</p>
<p>敬祝　先生</p>
<p>清健！</p>
<p>陸倫謹上</p>
<p>編者按：開設商店，無論在租界或在華界，均可向上海市社會局請求註册。關於註册手續，可向書局購閱「商人通例」一書參考。如有流氓藉端向新開商店需索，可卽鳴警法辦。</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我的友人，他認識了一位女友，迭次的過從，雙方漸生愛慕，據說他倆在愛的高熱時期，除甜吻外，並曾作半裸的擁抱等肉體的親近，（當然主動的是他）但是過後却受她的責怨，說是已經侮辱了她，要他想法補救。如果更進一步，從此結合，本來是很美滿的一回事，不過我友從小已經結婚。感情雖不佳，却也巳生子女，在理不能離棄，所以他倆籌商，迄無好的辦法，現在我想替他問問先生！</p>
<p>（一）如她及他的她及雙方家庭均能同意，照鄉俗娶爲平妻，（此俗聞廣東甚多，其他各處，似乎也有。卽一男娶兩女，均名爲妻。不分嫡庶。）在法律上，能否得到許可？</p>
<p>（二）法律上道德上破壞貞操之罪惡，是否以性交已遂，始爲成立之程度？</p>
<p>（三）果如上問，則性交之已遂與未遂，又如何分别？以上三項請先生在業餘信箱公開解答吧！</p>

<h3>夫婦（八）</h3>
<p>— 兪梅</p>
<p>她聽聽着脚步聲走了出去，聽了大門帶嚴密了，她又回復到安靜中只聽到遠處的一點人聲了。她在烟槍上黏了一個泡子，便蹲在火桶上，她俯着頭到了半睡眠打盹狀態，不知道時間過去了多少。</p>
<p>忽然大門又嚮了。她猛然驚醒了，心裏有點兒跳，問道，</p>
<p>「誰進來了？」她面向着房外。</p>
<p>「我。」回答聲中藴藏着笑的情感的成分。</p>
<p>「慢慢地，我來照你。」她敏捷地從火桶内跨出，把燈拿出房，男人已到房門外了。她向來的男人笑着問道，「幾點鐘了？」</p>
<p>「快打三更了。」來的男人說着，躺倒在烟單的左邊。</p>
<p>這男人比她的年紀大一點，有三十好幾歳。一副大朝俸的平庸的臉上露着笑容，從没有遮住小腿的地方露出來了皮袍的白羊毛。他做了一天煩瑣而又重要的事，他帶來一顆輕鬆像風箏的心，風箏放在雲空裏，三姑娘便是包圍着這風箏的春雲。</p>
<p>春雲替風箏倒了茶，把雙手握住了他的一隻手，問爲什麽事來得遲，累得久等。</p>
<p>一一天有許多事情。這兩天又偏偏特别忙。店裹要查貨，又要爲人家找事。」男人說着，把嘴凑到三姑娘的唇上，好久，三姑娘便靠倒在對方了。</p>
<p>「這一天要忙壞人了。」三姑娘把藴藏着光彩的眼睛看在他臉上。</p>
<p>「早上替黄小六子跑，晚上又替他跑到剛才，才有點頭緒。」</p>
<p>「黄小六子要講事情哪？那個東西皮極了。」</p>
<p>「去年替他講好了同泰，」他的口啣住已粘好一個泡子的烟槍的口，兩腮便一膨一翕地抽了起來，立刻先從鼻孔裏冒出了兩道灰烟。</p>
<p>三姑娘插言道，「同泰不是歇了麽？」</p>
<p>他點着頭，等一口完後，呻了一口茶，才接着說，「是的，倒了，又要講别人家啦。」</p>
<p>「同泰家的生意去年不是做得很可以麽？」</p>
<p>「裏面的人都很好。可是上海去年打仗，到處銀子不能活動，這就周轉不靈了。」</p>
<p>「街上生意還好。怎麽也蝕本了？」</p>
<p>「街上生意也不好。生意是一年不如一年了。你看外表自然是不清楚的。」</p>
<p>「那末，想個法子，店不收，行不行？」</p>
<p>男人對這有趣的話笑了一下。他燒着手裏的烟，說，「事情那里這樣容易。生意又不好，外而又什麽也不能周轉，這就完了。近來貨貴，鄉裏人也不買貨了。」</p>
<p>「鄉裏人爲什麽不買貨了呢？」三姑娘又看了他一眼，心裏高興着。</p>
<p>「眞是奇怪，現在家家生意都比從前做小了。貨簡直賣不出去。」</p>
<p>「總有幾家賺錢的吧？還能都這樣壞？」</p>
<p>「自然也有。像火油經理，香烟經理，洋糖經理，只要是經理洋貨總賺錢。不過日用的洋貨生意就不一定賺錢了。年頭是一年一年地壞下來了。」</p>
<p>「我記得好像前幾年没有聽見講過謀事這樣難。好像那時候比現在熱鬧些。這不曉得可是運氣的原故吧？還是刧數？」</p>

<h3>新年開始中好萊塢各大明星的估值（中）</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>自一九三三年之初爲始</p>
<p>一年之中價格漲落如何</p>
<p>僅在他一方面華雷斯的小朋友，傑克古柏（Ｊackie　Cooper），却已跌落了不少了。他從前在Ｓkippy片子裏，所引起的如火如荼樣的聲名，現在已經銷歇了許多……傑克到底漸漸長大了。但是可喜得很的，自從「博愛里」（Ｔhe　Bowery）發行之後，傑克的市價，無論他是成人，或是小孩子，己經重現蒸蒸日上之勢。傑克丨他到底是個天才者。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥（Ｊoan　Crawford），她雖然毫無問題的是位大女伶，可是被徵求到意見的大部份影評家，都異口同聲的說，她在一九三三年之中已經失掉了許多光輝，原因就是她一年之中，幾乎没有得到一個和她身份適合的脚本。很可喜的，亦像傑克古柏一樣，一張新片子，「飛燕驚鴻」（Ｄancing　Lady），出來了，她證劵市價的跌落，就立卽煞住了。</p>
<p>茂琳黛維絲（Ｍarion　Davies）和雷門諾伐羅（Ｒamon　Novarro），在這一年之中，還能保持他們原有的地位。雖然影戲界的證券市塲，是極端摇蕩着，但這兩位資望甚深的明星，始終不至於落伍。諾伐羅在西班牙語言的國家裏，有一種根深蒂固的勢力；那就是他獨到之處，可以依靠更多幾年亦不至於倒的。此外曼麗特蘭漱（Ｍarie　Dressler），在過去一載之中，亦維持了她的水平綫，但是要知道她的水平綫是個怎樣的水平綫！她是銀幕上最受人愛戴的一個人物。</p>
<p>要是拿去年一年作爲標凖，那約翰吉爾勃（Ｊohn　Gilbert）是己經成了過去的人物了。但是現在他又不能被人抹煞了，因爲他已經和那位瑞典大明星，葛雷泰嘉寳，合演了那張克利斯丁娜（Ｑueen　Christina）。張片子，聽說是很成功的。因此他個人的地位亦可以就此維持下去了。關乎葛雷泰嘉寳（Ｇreta　Garbo）自己，那是無庸說得的。無論誰，要是離開了銀幕一年之久，一定會受淘汰的，但是嘉寳？她是位神出鬼没的女子，她手下的影迷，不是僅僅的影迷，簡直是班瘋狂，緊跟着她，不會放鬆的！</p>
<p>克拉克蓋博（Ｃlark　Gable）在證劵市塲上的價格，是有些低落了，但是很奇怪的，他在影戲公司方面，却被認爲比從前更有價值。一九三三年是蓋博在銀幕上受人普遍崇拜的第三年了。當初初登銀幕時的轟動，當然現在已銷歇了許多，但是他接一連二的出好片子，他好像巳經掘了很深的戰壕，可以多少年替公司賺錢，而不至於失敗了。</p>
<p>去年　一年之中，價格最低落的，要算是蒙高茂（Ｒobert　Montgomery）了。他要恢復他從前的盛况，非有神助不可；要不然他須要接一連一，多演幾張像「兩婦之間難爲夫」（ＷhenLadis　Meet）的好片子。瑙瑪希拉（Ｎorma　Shear）因爲離開銀幕太久了，當然地位上亦受了影響。海倫漢絲（Ｈelen　Hayes）的價格，旣没有上升，亦没有跌落。李屈山（Lee　Tracy）却增進了不少。但升得最顯明的是琪恩哈羅（Ｊean　Harlow）她頗有和瓊克勞馥並駕齊驅之勢。要是瓊再不自小心，她的地位就要被琪恩奪去了。（未完）</p>
<h3>第三者關於「福地」的平議</h3>
<p>— 沉歟</p>
<p>白克夫人的「福地」是相當的轟動了歐美的文壇，在中國也有很多人給他注意。不久以前，就有人想將它編成電影劇本凖備開拍電影。後來没有成功。而最近又有美國電影公司派人來華攝製「福地」的消息。於是曹雲祥先生，就在本刊上發表文章說明「福地」是應該攝製。但是因此而引起每日電影的羅揚先生的反響，於是曹先生又在電影專刊上答復他。關於以前兩篇文章，我雖則看到，但已經不大記得清楚了。這裏我想用第三者的位地，要據「福地」小說及曹先生最近這篇文章說幾句話。</p>
<p>根據曹先生的文字，那末曹先生和羅揚先生爭論的焦點，第一就是主角王龍的「封建」的意識，是不是應該表現？</p>
<p>關於這問題我的意見是這樣的。在中國農邨中封建殘餘是極有力的「孔子學說」，以及「神道果報」，是深深地包圍着一切農民，所以以中國農村做題材而描寫到他們的封建意識是必然而且眞實的。但是我們要知道，因爲農村經濟的總崩潰，這種上層建造也隨着動摇，爲飢餓所鞭策的農人，是英勇地突破了這「封建」的「殘餘」而向前。同時也只衝破了這「封建」「殘餘」，然後纔有未來的進途。所以最優秀的作家，眞實的表現中國農邨，在描寫「封建殘餘」的時候，首先就該用批判的態度，表示出他們的逐漸崩壞。但是「福地」是不是這樣呢？完全不是的。白克夫人是一個宗敎信徒，她是單純的讚美着這些「封建殘餘」。不消說她是維護着這些「封建殘餘」，而不是摧毁他們的。</p>
<p>第二就是中國農村中黑暗面的暴露，是不是惡意宣傳？</p>
<p>我們覺得「家醜不可外揚」的觀念是不正確的。我們應該正確的暴露一切黑暗面，特别是豪紳地土的壓榨，封建軍閥的横暴，特别是帝國主義的侵略。只是把表象的鴉片，盜匪表現出來是不够的。所以我們對「福地」的描寫中國農村的黑暗面，并不反對，不過覺得「福地」所描寫的并不是主要的罪惡。至於中國的「天災」，那末一言以蔽之都是「人禍」。在人禍没有平復以前中國的天災是没有方法免掉的。外貨的傾銷，内戰的繼續，捐税的煩重，豪紳的魚肉。農民們最後一滴血都流盡，還有什麽餘力去修理水道種植林木呢？白克夫人在中國農邨中多時，難道看不到這些原因嗎？她是看着的，但故意的不說，這就是白克夫人之爲白克夫人。</p>
<p>總之「福地」是一部并不進步的小說。白克夫人的態度，雖然并不像其他一切「上帝的選民」那樣以「半開化」的或則「該吃苦的」來看中國民衆，但是中國農民的英勇的姿態我們在「福地」中一點也看不到。</p>
<p>「勤苦的工作罷，不要怨恨，上帝是最公道的」。中國農民或則就是白克夫人理想中的「兒女」罷？可惜他們已經不馴良起來了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「姊妹花」觀後</h3>
<p>— 金龍</p>
<p>這眞是一九三四年銀壇的奇蹟。剪接的適當，收音的美滿，導演的靈活，都超過明星以前一切的出品。胡蝶的成功，更出乎我們意外。表演的傳神，絲絲入扣，對白也一句句打動觀衆的心絃，興奮觀衆的情緒。</p>
<p>導演在畫面上的手腕運用也見成功。</p>
<p>不過化妝和佈景方面却似乎有些缺點，像趙母過於年老，於劇中人的身份不合。以及押犯人的軍法處，過於富麗等等。</p>
<p>最滿意的是字幕的减少，大部以簡潔動人的對白，表現劇情，而能使人滿意。</p>
<p>演員方面，都見成功，最值得讚揚而成功的，當然是胡蝶。她細膩的表情，加强本片的成績不少，宣景琳也不差，譚志遠後面幾幕太做作，而過火，他老是這樣的，</p>
<p>在荒蕪的中國影壇，發現這樣前進的作品我們深信鄭先生導演的影片，是不會使人失望的。</p>
<h3>「歸來的平凡」</h3>
<p>— 綠意</p>
<p>「歸來」打破了國産影片的紀錄，這是不錯的。爲何呢？是意識比一切國産影片正確嗎？不！是導演超越一切國片嗎？也不！是演員或攝影優勝一切國片嗎？還是不！那末，爲什麽說「歸來」是開中國影界的新紀錄呢？答曰：是因爲用了一個外國女子合演的緣故。僅僅是因爲用了一個外國女子的合演而我們就把牠加以讚評，這是錯誤的，因爲一張影片的優劣要靠内容和形式的完整，决不能拿演員的國籍問題來决定的。</p>
<p>有人說，歸來這張片子賣座之佳，完全是拿妮姬娣娜和一個「吻」來作號召的，這話並不過份，我想。</p>
<p>與其說「歸來」是一部悲劇，不如說「歸來」是一部聲劇。不管事實的經過是怎樣痛苦酸辛，但結局總是幸福的。</p>
<p>「歸來」的題材，用句時髦的口吻來說，並不見得現實的。那末，作者爲什麽要憑空創造出這個異國的三角戀愛的故事呢？欲故示新奇嗎？但「歸來」遠不如「人生」的有味，如果說「人生」是一杯紅茶，那末「歸來」好比一杯白開水。「人生」的劇情能激動人們的情感，並給人們以敎訓：但「歸來」不過是告訴人們一件平凡的故事而已。（下略）</p>
<h3>伊密爾詹寗氏的「風流天子」將出映</h3>
<p>本埠愛多亞路萬國影片公司，曾經給上海人士帶來很多的佳片，如「龍翔敎舞」「春江花月夜」「女性」「禁苑春濃」和「魔俠吉謌德」等，都曾驚震中國銀壇，獲得極佳的批評。現在，他們又有一部「風流天子」Ｍerry　Monarch，要在大上海大戲院公映了。</p>
<p>這個片子，是根據法國大文豪Pierre　Douys的名作改編而成的，餘下來的一個，是預備着閏年應用的。這個故事，表面上雖然寫盡國王的窮奢極慾，縱恣聲色，但是骨子裏，却是反對多妻制度的。</p>
<p>世界大演員伊密爾詹寗氏，在這片子裏飾着主角普莎王。女主角是在好萊塢澞壇上素負盛譽的雪爾馥絲。這部片子的攝製費用，差不多耗費一千八百萬法郎，大部份是在法國南部拍取的，其中尚有一小部份，係以奥國的古代宫堡爲背景。凡是巴黎的美女，大半都被集攏來，同時曾經配上英法兩國的說白，而在大上海開映的，就是英國對白的拷貝。（却酬）</p>
<h3>「中國海的怒潮」演出</h3>
<p>二十八日在北京</p>
<p>經過相當的攝製時期而完成的藝華公司出品，岳楓導演，袁美雲查瑞龍王引秦桐主演的「中國海的怒潮」，已經南京訓檢會檢查通過。</p>
<p>本片題材，以漁村作背景，發揚民族精神爲主，意識確很可取，而演員之表情，導演之手腕，以及鏡頭，剪接，均獲有很好成功，這片巳確定本月二十八日在北京大戲院演出。</p>

<h3>克利斯丁娜Ｑueen　Christina　十六</h3>
<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>到了次日早晨，克利斯丁娜坐在寳座上，下面站立的是羣臣和百姓的代表。她站了起來，向大衆宣佈她的意志。大家聽了，都面面相覷，表示着驚訝之色，然後又轟然發出了一陣不可不可的聲音。原來女王所宣佈的是她已决定讓位於查爾斯親王了。首相奥森斯提那氣急敗壞的喊：「陛下，不興！」克利斯丁娜抬起手來，先禁止了大家喧譁，然後對着首相道：「奥森斯提那，請你將我的王冠摘它下來。」奥森斯提那喊道：「不能。我曾在你先父面前發誓，我必定永遠將王冠保存在你的頭上。我不能參加這種事。我想在朝的羣臣，亦没有敢作這種事的。」克利斯丁娜徐徐地道：「那我祗可以自己取下了。」她說完了，就默然地將手裏所執的王節放在面前的案上，然後舉起手來將王冠自己取了下來，放在王節的一旁。她又復將王袍的帶解開了，任那袍落了下去，裏面顯出一身的白衣。她站在衆人前面，向他們致告别之辭。她說：「你們不必爲我害怕。我是在平安之中的。從今以後，我不再爲命運所支配。我無論遇見什麽事，我總是快樂的。上帝祝福於你們。再會吧。在我之上，祗有上帝是有威權的。」她說完了就一步一步，頭不稍回地走向宫門而去。</p>
<p>在但澤的港口，那裏停了一隻船，已經是掛蓬待發的樣子。克利斯丁娜帶了幾個從人走到那裏，那船主搶前幾步，鞠着躬說道：「雖然陛下已經放棄了你的王位，但是陛下還是陛下。」克利斯丁娜連忙問道：安東尼歐呢？」那船主道：「陛下，在船上，」但他慘然的聲音，已經是她的心覺着一陣心酸。她趕快從跳板走上船，在甲板上尋着安東尼歐。前面一個人跑了過來，但他不是安東尼歐，而是麥格納斯。他們的眼睛相遇了。克利斯丁娜問道：「安東尼歐在那裏？」她又覺得一陣心酸，因爲她的眼睛，已經瞥見一個像棺材的東西，上面用綢布蓋着。麥格納斯指着那東西道：「他在那裏面。」克利斯丁娜道：「他丨在丨那丨裏面。」她惶惶然好像待决的囚犯。</p>
<p>麥格納斯走前一步，喊道：「那是公正的决鬥，並且是他主張的。不是他，就是我。我勝了……雖是個不幸的勝，因爲你本會饒怒我的。」克利斯丁娜道：「麥格納斯，你離開這隻船。」麥格納斯恨恨地說道：「我幸虧勝了他。我知道我和他是勢不兩立的。」克利斯丁娜再催促道：「麥格納斯，你離開這隻船。」麥走開了。她立卽跪在棺材的旁邊，喊道：「安東尼歐！」她揭開那掩蓋屍體的綢布，默然神傷地看了一回，然後再掩上，嗚咽着說道：「安東尼歐！安東尼歐！我百呼不應的安東尼歐！我千百次訴說情愛的安東尼歐！我現在再說一遍，我愛你…我愛你…永遠永遠…」她站了起來，呌着她的老僕人歐拉夫，呌他去吩咐船主立卽開船。歐拉夫涙流滿面的道：「陛下不再稍候一候嗎？」克利斯丁娜道：「不等了，你吩咐他開船。」她站在棺材旁邊，面向着一望無涯的海。船慢慢開出去了，直到太陽沉淪的所在。（完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to sources, Sun's army is facing enemies on three sides, and its rear route has been cut off. Lu Fengnian's troops in Dengkou are showing signs of retreating to Shizuizi. There are reports that Zhuan Sunziyu's brigade is preparing to revolt. Internal disintegration within Sun's army is apparent. However, Sun is still secretly colluding with the Red bandits of Sichuan and Shaanxi, plotting to harm the Northwest. The authorities have decided to implement both pacification and suppression measures for the military affairs of suppressing Sun, to facilitate easier results. The issue of military expenses for the Fu army has not been agreed upon, and there is still no definite date for returning to Suiyuan. The claim of Jin-Sui armies following and pursuing is only publicly stated by the Jin side, and the authorities have not yet received a report. Regarding the battle situation in Ningyuan, the truth is unclear because there has been no telegram from Ma for a week. Some claim that a portion of Sun's army has crossed Ningxia and fled south, but the location is unknown. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Jin-Sui armies departed from western Suiyuan, the vanguard is now only ten miles away from Sansheng Palace, and the rear units are also advancing successively. Sun's army is very panicked because it has lost contact with both the front and rear. They have been fleeing in panic for days, preparing to retreat to Dengkou Shizuizi, but many have been intercepted and disarmed by Wang Jingguo's troops. The morale of the army is dissipated, and it has shown signs of disintegration. The enemy on the western route recently attacked Pingluo in Ningxia again, but failed each time. Now, feeling threatened by the northern route, they have stopped attacking. The fighting near Ningyuan has gradually eased. The rumor that Sun's troops bypassed and pursued Ningbian in an attempt to flee into Gansu is not necessarily reliable. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The chairman of Gansu Province, Zhu Shaoliang, replied to the province's office in Nanjing on the 24th, stating that the enemy and our troops are still in stalemate north of Ningyuan, and rumors are not to be believed. Xu's bandits and Sun are too far apart and difficult to merge. Special reply. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Peiping Military Sub-Council telegraphed Nanjing, stating that Sun Dianying has no remorse and determination to repent and is still preparing for war. In addition to ordering the armies of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to defend against attacks, most of the Jin-Sui armies have crossed Dengkou, and the vanguard troops have already contacted Sun's army. Currently, Sun, seeing that he is surrounded on all sides, is personally commanding and supervising the attack on Ningyuan on the front line, in order to flee towards Lingwu Zhongwei area. The military council has decided to tighten the alert on that army. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Arrives in Beiping Secretly</h3>

<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan arrived in Beiping on the 24th and is residing at Wan Fulin's residence. Reporters visited, but Wan's residence claimed he had not arrived. According to someone close to Ma, the person who came to Beiping yesterday was Lang Guanpu, who was in charge of discussing Ma's relocation to Beiping. Wan said that Beiping is easier to protect, so he hopes that Ma will move to Beiping. The reason for Ma's assassination is that a certain party was dissatisfied and provided a huge sum of more than 200,000 yuan to a group to mastermind the assassination. The group obtained the money and rented an empty room next to Ma's residence in the British Concession of Tianjin, planning to dig a wall into Ma's residence to carry out the assassination. The Public Security Bureau detected this and sent a secret agent to join the group. Therefore, on the day of the assassination, the perpetrators could not escape and may be tried by military law in the future. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Siamese Overseas Chinese Urge the Government to Conclude a Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Siam has a population of 20 million, with 3 million overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese have hundreds of schools in Siam, including 53 in Bangkok, such as the Chinese Middle School and the Overseas Chinese Middle School. Those who seek further education return to the country to enter Jinan University or Sun Yat-sen University Lingnan University. In recent years, the Siamese government intends to naturalize the Chinese into Siamese nationality. All schools are forced to learn Siamese, and when they reach a certain age, they must fulfill their military service obligations. Siam produces abundant rice, exporting tens of millions of piculs to various countries every year. Most of the rice mills in Siam were founded by the Chinese, and other businesses are also mostly run by the Chinese. As for Siamese people engaged in business, there are only a few in every hundred. However, China and Siam have no commercial treaty relationship, so the overseas Chinese in Siam are like nationals of countries with no treaty. Recently, tragic incidents have occurred, and the overseas Chinese feel more urgently the need to conclude a commercial treaty as soon as possible. They have repeatedly telegraphed and appealed in recent days. The government believes that the conclusion of a commercial treaty is a mutual agreement and cannot be established unilaterally, so the issue still requires considerable formalities.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Significance of Italy, Austria, and Hungary Joining Hands 恒</h3>
<p>The Great War is over. Of those seeking Germany's resurgence, France is the most active. The harsh conditions imposed on Germany by the Entente were mostly at France's insistence. Austria's independence and the formation of the Little Entente also relied on France's efforts. Later, as time passed, Britain and Italy gradually developed goodwill towards Germany, often voicing support for it on the international stage. However, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, international perceptions have undergone another change. Those who previously sympathized with Germany have become increasingly suspicious. After Austria's sudden actions and the exposure of the National Socialist Party's plot to seize power, Italy, which is connected to Austria, felt particularly uneasy. Italy also initiated the proposal for Britain, France, and Italy to maintain Austria's independence. Now, Italy has further moved to join hands with Austria and Hungary, adding another formidable enemy to Germany besides its historic rival, France. This is truly a great misfortune for Germany's revival movement.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why Italy resolutely joined hands with Austria and Hungary, but the main reason was prompted by Germany's designs on Austria. During the Great War, Italy abandoned the Triple Alliance and joined the Entente, aiming to acquire all of Albania, southern Anatolia in Turkey, and expand its colonies in North Africa. However, after the war, it did not gain an inch of Turkish territory, nor did it possess Albania. Its previous confidence did not materialize. Nevertheless, its grand ambition to turn the Adriatic Sea into its own inland sea and its ambition to spy on the Balkan Peninsula have never been forgotten. Attempts to forcefully seize Fiume from Yugoslavia and manipulate Albania's politics are manifestations of this ambition. Its relentless desire for Yugoslavia is aggressive. Without the existence of the Little Entente, an Italian-Yugoslav war would have broken out long ago. Therefore, the Little Entente is a brilliant structure carefully constructed by French diplomacy, aimed not only at preventing the merger of Germany and Austria but also at obstructing the revival of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and suppressing Italy's development in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Therefore, for Italy, to seek future development, it must first start by breaking the Little Entente. To break the Little Entente's alliance, it must first connect with countries that share its interests. The country whose interests most closely align with Italy is Hungary today. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, much of its territory was incorporated into the Little Entente, and Hungary's borders were particularly severely cut. Railways, rivers, forests, and mineral resources that could be used for livelihood were mostly divided among the Little Entente, and as many as three million Hungarians were incorporated into other countries. The Adriatic coastline is occupied by Yugoslavia. The pre-war economic system was severely damaged. At the same time, the national borders were surrounded on three sides by the Little Entente, making it impossible to move. To alleviate its suffering, to avoid the oppression of the Little Entente, and to seek a way out, it is wise to unite with Italy. By doing so, it can not only resist the Little Entente politically but also rely on Italy's ports like Fiume for economic exchange. Next, Austria can ally with Italy. The benefits for Austria allying with Italy are the same as for Hungary. However, Austria has always considered merging with Germany to be advantageous, but its repeated attempts have failed, gradually leading to a change of heart. The recent failure of the Nazi Party's plot to seize power in Austria has further facilitated the rapprochement between Austria and Italy, leading to the current situation of Italy, Austria, and Hungary joining hands.</p>
<p>The possibility of cooperation between Italy, Austria, and Hungary exists, as mentioned above. However, without the Nazi Party's plot in Germany, their cooperation would not have been so rapid. The cooperation between Italy, Austria, and Hungary will inevitably threaten the Little Entente led by France and affect Franco-Italian relations. Therefore, Italy's desire to break the Little Entente has been long in the making, but its manifestation in reality is now for the first time. The reason for its previous hesitation was fear of criticism from France. Now, however, the German Nazi Party is bent on revenge, and France's security is constantly threatened. If the merger of Germany and Austria were to succeed, it would certainly be detrimental to France. Therefore, turning a blind eye to Italy's development in Central Europe is a last resort. Unless Germany slightly curbs its aggressive ambitions, France and Italy will not clash. Therefore, the current conflict between Germany and Austria is actually benefiting Italy, and Germany's revival will face even greater difficulties.</p>
<h3>Conflicting Policies on Austria Deepen the Rift Between Italy and Germany</h3>
<p>Military Group in the Danube Region</p>
<p>Major Source of Turmoil in Central Europe</p>
<p>Vienna Italy's Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Suvich, arrived here from the Hungarian capital at noon today. He hosted a banquet at the Italian Embassy for Prime Minister Dollfuss of Austria. After the banquet, they held talks to discuss the negotiations in Hungary and the recent events in Austria. Suvich left for his home country that evening. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The differences between Italy and Germany regarding the Austrian issue have led to increasingly tense relations between the two countries, causing anxiety in European diplomatic circles. The main point of contention between the two countries is the independence of Austria. However, the issue of economic solutions in the Danube region has also deepened the rift between the two countries. Italy recently put forward suggestions on this matter, with the independence of Austria as an important condition, and opened a sea outlet for Austria and Hungary via Trieste or Fiume. The eyes of European leaders are now focused on Suvich, the Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs. Suvich visited the capitals of Austria and Hungary a few days ago and then came to Vienna again today to have a long talk with Austrian Prime Minister Dr. Dollfuss at the Italian Embassy. The nature of the discussion has not been clearly stated, but according to unofficial sources, the possibility of forming an economic and military group among Austria, Hungary, and Italy was discussed. Suvich's return to Vienna was unexpected, causing anxiety in Berlin political circles. According to general opinion, the establishment of a new group in Central Europe and the Baltic Sea cannot contribute to the solution of the Austrian issue or promote European peace. It is also doubtful whether Dr. Dollfuss will gain the support of the Austrian people in the current negotiations. The restoration of Austria, in the eyes of the Germans, will become another major element of chaos in Central Europe. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Defend Policies Toward Hungary and Austria</h3>
<p>Rome Italian newspapers have unanimously defended Italy's policies toward Hungary and Austria, stating that Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich's visit to Hungary was decided long ago. It is natural for Italy to provide assistance to Hungary and Austria. However, this assistance has no political nature and does not involve customs unions. The Little Entente countries should not be alarmed by this. The news of Germany's role is even more incomprehensible because when Germany makes demands, as long as what it asks for is in accordance with justice, Italy will actively provide assistance. The evening paper said, "Anyone who wants to act against justice and harm Germany, Italy will speak out righteously, helping Germany with a friendly attitude without seeking reward. Anyone who knows the history of recent years can say this." The same newspaper also said that some people say that Italy sometimes gets close to Germany and sometimes becomes friendly with France, maneuvering between the two major powers with an uncertain attitude. This kind of argument is the talk of those who are scheming and treacherous. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Release of Russian Staff Opens Way for Softened Japanese Attitude Toward Russia</h3>
<p>Hirota Takes Responsibility for Breaking the Deadlock</p>
<p>Efforts to Reopen Illegal Sale of the Railway Negotiations</p>
<p>(Moscow) A report from Boli says that six Russian staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway who were arrested last September have been released as a result of negotiations among representatives from the Soviet Union, Japan, and "Manchukuo" in Tokyo and Harbin. The Soviet side insisted that the release of the arrested personnel and the restoration of normal railway administration were prerequisites for reopening the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, the release of the six men means restoring the Chinese Eastern Railway to its rightful status as stipulated in the Beijing-Fengtian Agreement. The released personnel are free to return to their country, and their vacant positions will be filled by the Soviet side. As for the illegal agents appointed by the "Manchu" side during the conflict period, they will also return to their original posts. (TASS dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the illegal negotiations of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the Russian puppets have been completely suspended since last September when the puppet organization arrested Russian railway staff and demonstrated against Russia, and Russia revealed the Japanese puppet's plot to seize the railway, up to the present day. After Foreign Minister Hirota took office, he took on the responsibility of breaking the deadlock between Japan and Russia. As a result of several contacts with the Russian side, Hirota proposed the following compromise conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the six arrested Russian railway staff, the Russian side insisted on immediate release and reinstatement, while the puppet side insisted on appointing puppet staff to replace them. The stalemate could not be broken, so the Japanese side proposed a compromise: the puppet organization releases the arrested Russian staff, and Russia voluntarily recalls them to their country. Their successors will be Russian staff.</p>
<p>(2) The power to appoint and remove staff belongs to the board of directors, and the director of the management bureau cannot appoint or remove staff. This is to ease the claims of both sides.</p>
<p>The Russian side has accepted Japan's proposal, and the puppet country also released the Russian staff yesterday. After their successors take office, the conference can be reopened. Japan and the puppets hope to convene an illegal meeting on the 27th or 28th. (China United News dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The release of six Russian staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the "Manchukuo" government has created a good impression in Moscow. People here believe that this is the starting point for the railway dispute between Russia and Manchuria to move from tension to relaxation, and the danger of conflict between Russia and Japan can also be reduced as a result. According to reports from Harbin, although the Russian staff have been released, they may be deported, and their duties will be handled by "Manchukuo" assistant staff until the railway board of directors appoints replacements. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the Soviet Ambassador visited Foreign Minister Hirota on the 8th, he said that if "Manchukuo" released the Soviet staff of the Eastern Railway, the Soviet side would propose a new sale price to proceed with the Eastern Railway negotiations. Now that the Soviet staff in question have been released, negotiations on the Eastern Railway in Tokyo are bound to resume. Foreign Minister Hirota will convey this to the Russian Ambassador upon receiving formal notification from "Manchukuo." The Russian Ambassador will then report to his home government for instructions. After the resumption, the Russian Ambassador will propose a new price in Japanese currency. Therefore, the future negotiations will focus on how to bridge the gap between this new price and the price desired by "Manchukuo." (Electric Communication dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet-Manchu border river navigation conference and the border survey committee were previously broken off due to the insincerity of the Soviet Union. The "Manchu" government was preparing to resolve it independently. However, yesterday, when diplomatic representative Shi Luben visited Russian Consul in Harbin, Slazitsky, to announce the release of the Soviet staff, the Russian Consul made an unofficial statement about these two conferences, expressing a willingness to convene them. The "Manchukuo" government, believing that the Soviet side has expressed sincerity and is preparing to convene the meetings, considers that this is enough to improve Soviet-Manchu relations and has decided to suspend independent action. Therefore, the above two meetings can be realized in the coming days.</p>

The responsibility for maintaining peace in the Pacific should be jointly borne by the two countries.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Economic and Communications Section today released a report on the pessimism of the current state and future prospects of world commerce. After carefully examining last year's figures, while national trade has occasionally improved, international commerce has declined. The volume of goods exchanged between countries last year decreased by 30% compared to 1929, and its value decreased by half when calculated in currency. Gold countries mostly retained 35% of their 1929 trade value, while the United States retained only a quarter.

<h3>Japanese Political Strife Rages On</h3>
<p>Military and Financial Cliques Oppose Each Other</p>
<p>The Military Exposes the Sins of Financial Cliques and Political Parties on Disciplinary Grounds</p>
<p>Financial Cliques and Political Parties Attack the Military's Interference in Politics on Military Disciplinary Grounds</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The struggle between the Japanese military and financial cliques is intensifying in the 65th Diet. The financial cliques are pursuing the military with statements on military discipline issues and alienation between the military and the people. The military is exposing the irregularities of financial cliques and political parties on disciplinary grounds. The struggle between the two sides is at a standstill. In the early stages of the 65th Diet, Army Minister Araki resigned due to illness after being attacked by both financial cliques and internal factions. The financial cliques took the opportunity to pursue, seeming to have gained the upper hand. However, in early February, the military turned defense into offense and concentrated its efforts on attacking Commerce Minister Nakajima. It turned out that Nakajima, under the direction of the financial cliques, manipulated both the political and civilian parties to attack the military. The military hated this person very much and used the feudal forces of the Upper House to attack the irregularities of Commerce Minister Nakajima. Commerce Minister Nakajima could not withstand the pressure and resigned due to illness. The military took advantage of the victory to pursue further, again raising the corruption of Ministers Hatoyama and Mito. The purpose was to break the united military of the political parties, first split the Seiyukai, cause internal strife within the political parties, and then overthrow the cabinet in order to obtain the next government. The political parties have recently become aware of the conspiracy, and the Okamoto Inquiry Committee will also cancel its extreme policies to guard against the military's schemes and prevent the political parties from splitting themselves. However, the internal affairs of the Seiyukai are very complicated, making it difficult to guard against. It is difficult to predict who will win the struggle between the two sides at present. The internal situation is listed as follows:</p>
<h3>President's Faction</h3>
<p>The so-called President's Faction of the Seiyukai was formed during the era of President Tanaka. At that time, Suzuki wooed Hatoyama, Mori, Kuhara, Nakahashi, Yamamoto (Tei), Hata, Kawamura, Katsuta, Nakajima, Shimada, Matsuno, and Yamaguchi to oppose the Tokonami Faction. After Tanaka's death, Inukai was elected as President to prevent Tokonami from contending for the presidency. After Inukai's death in the May 15th Incident, Suzuki became President himself. At this time, the Kuhara Faction separated from the Suzuki Faction and established its own faction to compete with Suzuki. The important members of the current President's Faction are as follows: Hatoyama, Ando, ​​Ashida, Ono, Morita, Inuzaki, Ishizaka, Hoshijima, Kawamura, Shimada, Matsuno, Tanabe, Yamaguchi, Uehara, Shiga, Hirose, Tsuchikura, Okada, Murata, Kawakami, Kawashima, Wakamiya, Okada, Shimizu, Kumagai, Shibube, Miyakawa, Fujio, Mikami, Makino Kobayashi, Nakano, Ichinose, Wakamoto, etc., currently occupy the majority of the party's power.</p>
<h3>Kuhara Faction</h3>
<p>When General Tanaka served as President of the Seiyukai, half of its political funds were provided by Kuhara Fusanosuke, and half were paid out of the secret funds of the Army Ministry, which enabled it to maintain its power. Later, General Tanaka gradually lost his power after taking the blame for the Zhang Zuolin bombing incident. After General Tanaka's death, Kuhara approached the Suzuki Faction and opposed the Tokonami Faction. Its main figures are: Tsugumo, Nishikata, Fujii, Tako, Nishimura, Namba, Kuramoto, Tsusaki, and Iwasaki, etc. Its members are about 50 people. Kuhara himself is a second-rate military leader in Japan, with the Japan Industrial Company as its headquarters. Its financial strength is valued within the party.</p>
<h3>Yamamoto Faction</h3>
<p>The leader of the Yamamoto Faction is Yamamoto Teijiro. Yamamoto was previously the president of the Taiwan Sugar Company, exploiting the people of Taiwan to create his current position. He once served as Minister of Agriculture. After Tanaka's death, his assets were used up, and his power was not as good as before. The main figures under his faction are: Azuma, Sunada, Kono, Tatsukawa, and Takeda, only a dozen people. They often take a neutral attitude towards the Suzuki-Tokonami dispute.</p>
<h3>Tokonami Faction</h3>
<p>Since Tokonami left the Minseito and returned to the Seiyukai, he has formed his own faction within the party. Originally, Hatoyama, Kawamura, Mizuno, Katsuta, etc. were all members of the Tokonami Faction. Because Tokonami was fickle and unable to take on national affairs, they abandoned Tokonami and surrendered to the Suzuki Faction. Its main members are as follows: Kurazono, Higuchi, Kaneda, Haruna, Suzuki, Taki, Terada, Toyota, Togo, Nakamura, and Mori, etc. There are a total of 60 or 70 people in the same faction within the party, which is the largest force against Suzuki. Mochizuki, Okazaki, Mito, Hamada, Imai, Noda, and Yamamoto (Taro), who are known as the old Seiyukai faction, have recently gradually approached the Tokonami Faction.</p>
<p>Others, such as Maeda Yonezo, who claims to be neutral, is actually a member of the Suzuki Faction. Yamazaki, Kato, Kinoshita, and Azuma, although claiming to be neutral, are actually members of the Tokonami Faction. The truly neutral faction is Takahashi Korekiyo, Horikiri, and Oguchi, only a dozen people. (China United Press News)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Executives Sponsor the Great Union Movement</h3>
<p>Want to Fight the Government on Rural Issues</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's Great Union faction wants to use the power of united political parties to resist the military. Seiyukai executives initially suspected a conspiracy to exclude President Suzuki and did not welcome the movement very much. Yesterday, Tobu had a meeting with Kinoshita Narutaro, Shimada, and Yamaguchi and obtained their understanding. Last night, Shimada and Uchida, each Secretary-General, and Yamaguchi, Secretary-General, secretly discussed the matter in a certain place. As a result, they decided that the Great Union faction's internal plan for party unity and external plan for political party liaison would be beneficial to the party's future, and the executives decided to guide the movement with this attitude. Today's House and Outside Affairs General Meeting will formally recognize their actions. President Suzuki may personally visit Wakatsuki, President of the Minseito, and Adachi, President of the Kokumin Domei, at the end of March to exchange views and promote the Great Union of political parties. (China United News dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Seiyukai, in order to change the atmosphere of the political world and avoid the expansion of internal strife in the Seiyukai, plans to concentrate its efforts to discuss rural issues. The Seiyukai said that the rural relief fund is only 20.89 million, which is not enough and is far from the Seiyukai's demands. It has decided not to deal with the situation temporarily with a passive policy, but to pursue the government on rural issues and, if necessary, submit a motion of no confidence, not hesitating to fight the government. (China United News dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>The House of Peers Will Pursue the Government on Disciplinary Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Otsuka Korekata and Yamakuma Koji of the House of Peers Research Group will pursue the government on the issue of Minister of Education Hatoyama. Some believe that this is a political action taken by the Kokumin Domei faction in the House of Peers. Therefore, after discussing measures by the Research Group's executives, it was believed that the two men's questions were due to personal beliefs, and the party could not restrict them. On the other hand, other factions will also discuss the issue. The Kayokaikai faction is looking for questioners. If Prime Minister Saito attends the plenary session on the 28th, Otsuka Korekata and other influential figures will begin an urgent motion on Minister of Education Hatoyama. Therefore, it is difficult to predict what the result will be. On the disciplinary issue in the House of Peers, or there may be great progress. (Electric Communication dispatch on the 25th)</p>

In addition, Minister of Agriculture Goto will also attend tomorrow. The Diet has also entered the final stage. Therefore, there will be a heated discussion on the issue of the Minister of Education and the supplementary budget. (Electric Communication dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>14th Anniversary of the Founding of the National Socialist Party</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech Vigorously Denounces the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>National Fortune Can Only Be Recovered with Wartime Spirit</p>
<p>Looking Back to Encourage the Future</p>
<p>Supporting Peace No Less Than Others</p>
<p>Munich: Today, a meeting was held here to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party. Premier Hitler attended the meeting and delivered a speech, stating that in 1920, the Chinese people first realized the harm of the Treaty of Versailles and knew that they were actually paying the price of peace with enslavement. Looking forward, they were filled with trepidation. From the beginning, we felt that this kind of fate could only be reversed with resolute resistance. However, the turning point in Germany's national fortune could never be achieved by those who plunged the country into suffering. The figures and parties of the past could not be the pillars of the country. New leaders were needed. These clean leaders came from the trenches, and could only come from there, because only those who had faithfully fulfilled their duties to the motherland for four and a half years could save the motherland. Only they could have the great power to organize the chaotic domestic affairs. Therefore, the German soldiers began to work, creating the National Socialist Party, and knowing that to seek a healthy future, they should not maintain parliamentary institutions, but should fight to the death against freedom and system. Therefore, apart from the Party, no other parties could be tolerated, and all unnecessary reconciliations were rejected in order to achieve the goal of all the people of the country being compatriots. But this could only be achieved by breaking down all previous barriers with the spirit of wartime, and only by combining nationalism and socialism could the strength of our people be drawn from the bottom of the abyss, and the most unified group in German history be created with sincerity. If backward celebrities are recruited, or there is no firm belief and fervent loyalty to the new movement, then victory will ultimately belong to us, because those who can only call on some leaders to support them will inevitably wander in the wilderness, and only those who can call on the people of the whole country to be their backing can obtain a new source of power. Therefore, obtaining the representatives of the new country and the future of Germany is the great work of our movement. Hitler then thanked 2,000 old comrades for their assistance, which led to today's success, but today is still the first stage of development, and the struggle after this cannot be slackened. In the end, he said that we will never allow the German people to waste their energy on civil war. Although we cannot have cannons, tanks, and airplanes today, there are still many peaceful undertakings to be done, because the whole country really wants to be our backing. Those who represent the whole country will not hesitate to take responsibility for war. Those who only get the support of a part of the people often try to consolidate their domestic position with foreign wars. We do not need foreign victories today to win the people's hearts, but only demand that this people be given the rights they deserve. We deeply feel the righteousness of this demand and dare to be proud of being fervent supporters of peace. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Premier Hitler issued a broadcast speech today to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party. In the speech, he reiterated Germany's intention for peace, saying that politicians would not resort to national power until absolutely necessary. Hitler had a new request to the people, but did not indicate whether it was a plebiscite or another election. Celebrations will continue tomorrow. Hitler will speak in Munich and broadcast it to various places by radio. At that time, one million political leaders from various places who are tasked with spreading National Socialist ideology among the people will be guided by Hess in Munich by radio and swear an oath of loyalty to Hitler. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Fourteen years ago, Premier Hitler announced the 25 basic principles of the National Socialist Party in Munich. A commemoration was held today. In the evening, Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech in front of 5,000 party members and party officials, saying that the martyrs of the National Socialist movement all possessed courage, and later party members should maintain it. He also said that the internal ranks of the National Socialist Party are clear and not confused at all. When applied to governing the country, it should also be like this. Goebbels then said, we should train party members to despise money. He also said, "The various parties belonging to the bourgeoisie have flexible goals, but the methods they use are very strict. The National Socialist Party reverses this approach, that is, the goals do not change, but the methods used can be flexible," and so on. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Berlin State Opera Commemorates World War Dead Soldiers</h3>
<p>President Attends with Cabinet Members</p>
<p>The Whole Country Flies Flags at Half-Mast</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the heroic memorial day for the two million German soldiers who died in the European War. Memorial ceremonies were held throughout the country, and public buildings everywhere flew flags at half-mast. Many private residences in Berlin hung national flags with black gauze outside their windows. A grand memorial ceremony was held at the Berlin State Opera. President Hindenburg wore his uniform, and most cabinet members and representatives of civil and military officials attended in person. The stage of the opera house was full of national flags and pine and cypress trees. At the opening, the German musician Beethoven's famous piece "Coriolanus" was played. Then, Defense Minister General von Blomberg gave a speech, praising the heroism of the German soldiers and Germany's peaceful aspirations. At the end of the ceremony, the famous musician Wagner's funeral music "Twilight of the Gods" was played, followed by the national anthem and the song of the National Socialist Party. President Hindenburg then inspected four companies of the National Defense Forces and 300 policemen under the "Unter den Linden," and finally laid a wreath at the memorial monument for the fallen soldiers. Large crowds gathered around the opera house and the Lustgarten. All the ceremonies in the opera house were transmitted outside the house by wireless loudspeakers. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany's War Preparations Ambitions</h3>

<p>(London) A book written by German Professor Hense, entitled "Is Germany Already Preparing for War?", became quite famous after its publication. Now, its English translation will be published in the UK on Monday of next week. In addition to advocating that Germany should seize the French provinces of Alsace-Lorraine, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the Dutch colonies when the war begins, this book details the plan to invade the British Isles. Professor Hense was previously known throughout Europe for his book "Military Science." This book should be given special attention by the British people. Germany has previously tried its best to prevent this book from being sold in the UK and the US, which shows its intentions. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Rumors of a Cabinet Reshuffle in the UK</h3>
<p>Hunger Marchers Gather in London to Demonstrate</p>
<p>The Authorities Take Stern Measures to Deal With It</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Paris edition of the "Daily Mail," although the British cabinet will be reshuffled, all cabinet members have not left their posts. However, it is not known whether Public Health Minister Young will resign. Former Foreign Secretary Simon will succeed Gilmore as Home Secretary, and former War Secretary Hailsham will replace Lord Sankey as Lord Chancellor. As for the post of War Secretary, it will be filled by the current Home Secretary Gilmore. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) There are rumors today that the cabinet will be changed. The Times said that Simon may be transferred to the Home Office. Someone asked Simon about this, and he replied that this kind of news is really unreliable, but only a kind of political action. However, people outside the government still do not suddenly regard the change of cabinet members as impossible. Some even said that Prime Minister MacDonald will also serve as Foreign Secretary. Although it is difficult to determine whether this kind of rumor is reliable, the general public cannot help but speculate on what attitude the majority party in Congress will take if this kind of fact happens. Regarding this point, we should pay attention to the fact that the majority party in Congress that has always supported the current cabinet now holds an opposing attitude due to unemployment and the Ceylon issue. Although its opposition is accidental, its extent should not be underestimated. (According to reports, hunger marchers are now gathering in London from all over the country. The authorities are preparing to deal with it. From the perspective of British domestic affairs, this is a very difficult problem. As for the Ceylon issue, recently, Conservative MP Crawford in the House of Commons proposed to organize a Congressional committee to investigate the implementation of the democratic constitution in Ceylon for the past year and a half, which is enough to prove the dissatisfaction of the British people with the Indian policy of the British government) (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a London message received by the "Daily News," an organization of unemployed workers, the Hunger Marchers, departed from Scotland and northern England and are approaching London. They are scheduled to hold a demonstration in Hyde Park in the British capital tomorrow afternoon. The British authorities have taken strict measures to prevent disturbances. Tomorrow, 3,000 police officers will be on duty, assisted by a volunteer police force. The Hunger Marchers will be divided into ten teams and will gather in Hyde Park. Ten temporary podiums have already been erected inside the park so that the demonstrators can make speeches. According to reports, the government recently submitted a draft law requesting a reduction in unemployment relief. This demonstration was launched in opposition to this bill. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Military Aircraft Transport Mail</h3>
<p>Accidents Occur Frequently Due to Bad Weather</p>
<p>Congress Calls It a Murderous Policy</p>
<p>(New York) After President Roosevelt canceled the contracts of the airmail companies, the US airmail was transported by land and military aircraft. Unexpectedly, accidents occurred one after another. Six aircrew members died in a week. Now, a large transport plane is missing in a blizzard after flying away from Salt Lake City yesterday. Eight people are on board, and their lives are in danger. According to reports, the domestic airmail contracts were canceled after it was discovered that there were improper exchanges of interests. President Roosevelt ordered that any company whose improper contract has been canceled shall not be allowed to undertake it again within five years. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The plan to have military aircraft handle airmail transport was finally passed by the House of Representatives, but its term shall not exceed one year. All expenses incurred for transporting mail shall be transferred from the Postal Department to the military organs. For example, the expenses for replacing a new aircraft in case of an aircraft accident are one end of it. There was a fierce debate when the House of Representatives discussed it. Republican congressmen attacked the government, saying that what it was doing was a murderous policy, "sacrificing drivers for the convenience of the authorities, and the order to cancel the mail transport contracts was tantamount to writing it in blood," and so on.

<h3>Development of German Trade Policy (German Dispatch)</h3>
<p>How the various countries of the world have developed in trade policy during 1933 cannot be clearly understood without reviewing the events that have transpired in trade policy over the years. The World Economic Conference, or especially its failure, was indeed a major blow to the development of commercial relations. However, the reason for the incessant changes in the organization of the world economy has been around for quite some time.</p>
<p>The abandonment of the gold standard, which is of utmost importance to the world economy, the attempt at British economic solidarity, and the rise of Japan with its strong export industry, as well as the fact that all countries are seeking to avoid the accidental impact of other countries' development, all of these are major reasons why new methods must be devised to revive world commerce. In recent years, the protectionism continuously implemented by various countries will inevitably prompt each country to not cooperate with others in an emergency situation, making the unity of each national economy increasingly tight, and autarky will also expand day by day, eventually even returning to the primitive situation before ancient times. However, nations participating in world trade are unwilling to have this evolution, because although each country wants to make its national economy independent, they all understand that if the differences in climate and geography between regions and countries are to be eliminated, the industrial assistance of a new era in transportation and trade must be used to assist them. Even the spiritual success of other nations cannot be achieved without this. To create a situation in which international goods exchange can be enhanced under a strengthened national economy, experiments have been seen everywhere in recent years. However, as a result of all negotiations and meetings, countries have generally failed to anticipate the major changes that have occurred after the war. This is undeniable. On the other hand, economists in various countries still believe that the ideal solution is to restore a situation that is suitable for the conditions before the European war. However, one thing has been overlooked, that is, "all communication between nations must be suitable for their internal organization." For example, it is inconceivable for a nation with extreme economic freedom and no plans to have its national management relate to foreign trade. Conversely, it is also impossible for a national economy under economic planning to enter a free system in foreign trade without major setbacks. In essence, the major collapse of the world economy is ultimately a contradiction in economic organization and economic meaning. The economies of the 19th and 20th centuries all gradually developed through their own efforts to a state of equilibrium. Unfortunately, this economy was devastated by the previous great war. Subsequently, new production sites have emerged everywhere. However, their rise was neither under natural conditions nor without others competing, and even under national protection, or even under national coercion, they were able to achieve great success. The circumstances are as described above. However, it is obvious that no nation in the world is willing to have this newly created production subject to foreign competition, without resistance, and return to annihilation. In addition, the Treaty of Versailles, the special status of Soviet Russia, and the chaos in the Far East all hinder the restoration of the economic equilibrium to its previous state through its own efforts.</p>
<p>As the country occupying the widest ground in Europe vigorously implements state-run foreign trade, whether the above-mentioned equilibrium can be restored, and whether there is a possibility of restoration if only in Europe, economists with far-sighted plans will all question what has happened. The fact that Soviet Russia must have a special stance in its price calculation alone means that other countries have no ability to counteract it. Fortunately, thanks to the effective measures taken by the Soviet Russian commercial representative agencies, the world economy has not undergone fundamental changes solely due to the Soviet Russian problem. However, the changes in the Soviet Russian economy are only the most notable events in its evolution. In fact, there are other things that are also sufficient to promote the realization of the same destruction of economic equilibrium. For example, if a certain country has always imported huge amounts of food, it suddenly changes its course, increases its domestic food production, and makes its import demand only a fraction of its previous imports. Consider the results of Italy's food war, and you can infer others. Furthermore, if a supplier of goods to a certain country suddenly feels powerless and unable to accommodate a corresponding amount of exchange goods, all of these are sufficient to destroy the economic equilibrium, and are inevitable. To remedy this, for several years, loans have not been raised to make up for the negative numbers in commercial settlements. However, the supplier of goods repays the creditor, and the creditor uses it to pay for the goods supplied. In this way, the supplier of goods pays himself with his own funds. As a result, the countries involved suffer losses in their payment and commercial settlement, and the situation remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The 1933 Economic Conference attempted to eliminate this situation. However, for this purpose alone, the situation of each country pursuing its own interests and the lack of sincerity on all sides, and the common sacrifices for the nation, have been fully exposed. The experiment of devising a general compromise between the world and the international community has come to an end. The only result actually obtained by the World Economic Conference was not the elimination of obstacles, but only preliminary matters for world planned economy, such as the establishment of committees to discuss the production and distribution of wheat, sugar, wood, etc.</p>
<p>Shortly before the World Economic Conference, a tariff truce was established for a time. At that time, most countries participated. However, in the blink of an eye, several countries had already announced their withdrawal, so that the tariff truce was of little importance to trade policy. Because the World Economic Conference was fruitless, the stagnation in trade continued to develop, and the principled changes in trade policy followed. Although countries still formally maintain the principle of most-favored-nation treatment, some countries have changed their original intentions and implemented an import adjustment system (Kontigcntierung), thus reducing the effectiveness of the most-favored-nation treatment regulations.</p>
<p>Germany learned a lesson from the experience of the World Economic Conference, that is, it is difficult to find an international solution to the difficulties of various countries. Only through the healthy development of the national economy of each country can the crisis of the world economy be overcome. In view of this, Germany has devoted itself to the consolidation of its internal economy, and has made particular efforts to eliminate the huge unemployment problem and devise plans to revitalize the situation of farmers. The effects achieved have been very significant. For example, the number of unemployed has been reduced by 2.5 million. Market management and price management measures have further promoted German production to independence, no longer subject to the fluctuations of world market prices. The profitable German peasant economy has therefore also gained a foundation.</p>
<p>This approach has guided the production of industry towards improvement, and indirectly has benefited the development of German foreign trade. Although the index of German foreign trade once stopped falling in 1932, it continued to decline in 1933, and the decline was enormous, so that in 1933, Germany's exports were only half of the previous year's figure. The reason for this is that Germany has always refused to supply its currency standard to the experiment of trade policy. Important competing countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan have all abandoned their gold standard and started a policy of devaluation dumping. At this time, Germany still maintains the gold standard of its currency. In this way, the export trade has been sharply reduced, and the foreign exchange deficit will inevitably rise with it. Germany was forced to implement foreign exchange controls, and in order to make foreign exchange easier to settle in terms of control, it had signed agreements with various countries on payment and settlement. Payment agreements can be divided into two types in form, namely, national agreements (that is, those signed between governments in the form of records) and bank agreements (that is, those agreed between the national bank and the banks of other countries issuing banknotes).</p>
<h3>Seven Photographs of the Puppet Government Organized in Southern Xinjiang</h3>
<p>This photograph shows the two puppet Tao-yins released by Tie Muer, the puppet leader during the rebellion, to Kashgar: (1) Su Jinshou (Hui Hui), (2) You Wenbin (Turban). Since Tie Muer's death, Su Jinshou has fled to Han City. Now the puppet Tao-yin of Kashgar is only You Wenbin. You's original name is You Luosi.</p>
<p>The purpose of the national agreement is to fundamentally abolish the foreign exchange restrictions on imports, and under this situation, to revitalize international goods communication. Importers use the funds to pay for the import of goods. If the maximum amount of foreign exchange exceeds the limit, an account can be opened at the bank issuing banknotes in that country, so that when continuing to import goods, it can be paid to the name of the account opened without restriction. The foreign bank issuing banknotes pays the creditors of foreign goods in the currency of that country, and uses the funds deposited in the name of the account to pay for German export goods. However, this agreement is only effective for countries that are not subject to foreign exchange pressure and have no compulsory economy. The intention of establishing a bank agreement is to make it easier for countries with weak foreign exchange to seek convenience in payment procedures with each other. The standard of payment of the signatory country is limited to the national currency of each country in the agreement. All import and export debts owed by both parties are settled by the bank. In this way, the numbers revealed in the monthly settlement can not only be offset against each other, but can also be completed. That is, the goods exported by that country to this country can also be paid for. For this reason, the trade communication between the two parties should be able to develop based on it.)</p>

<h3>Zhangjia Goes to Mongolia to Preach</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart on the 28th</p>
<p>First Stationed in the Yikezhao League</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Zhangjia Hutuktu, the envoy to preach to Mongolia, has been living in Beiping for a long time. At first, he was unable to enter Mongolia because Mongolian youths in Beiping opposed Zhangjia's obstruction of autonomy. Later, he was postponed due to illness, and the departure was delayed because the travel expenses had not been fully negotiated. The central government, in order to pay attention to the border affairs of Inner Mongolia, urged Zhangjia to go to Mongolia to preach. A few days ago, Zhangjia telegraphed the central government, instructing the preaching policy and allocating travel expenses. Now the central government has remitted the travel expenses, and the Ministry of Railways has telegraphed the PingSui Railway to prepare a special train. On the 26th and 27th, the special train will arrive in Ping. Zhangjia is scheduled to depart for Mongolia on the 28th, first stationed in the Yikezhao League, and set up a temporary office in the league. The preaching envoy's office is still located in the Songzhu Temple in Beiping, leaving behind a part of the staff to contact the temporary office and communicate with the central government. It is reported that Zhangjia's entourage this time will be drawn from the staff of various offices and departments of the preaching envoy's office. After Awang, the deputy league leader of the Yikezhao League, came to Ping, he met with Zhangjia for several days. Awang expressed his welcome to Zhangjia's entry into Mongolia. Zhangjia will discuss various issues in Inner Mongolia with Awang, and will discuss the most detailed details about preaching to the Mongolian people. Zhangjia will go from the Yikezhao League to the Tumote Banner, Ulanqab League, Xilin Gol League, and Dariganga Pasture to specialize in preaching matters. (24th)</p>
<h3>Northern Route Army Suppresses Bandits in Northwestern Fujian</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the Shaxi Area</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: After Chiang Kai-shek quelled the Fujian rebellion, he proceeded to complete the original plan of converging troops from five provinces to suppress bandits in Ruijin and Tingzhou. He gathered the bandits from western Fujian, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, Dong Zhentang, Luo Binghui, and other puppet 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 9th Army Corps. Taking advantage of the fact that Chiang Dingwen's troops had advanced to southern Fujian and northern Fujian was empty, they fled from Jianning and Taining to Jiangle, Shunchang, Shaxian, and Yong'an, in an attempt to spy on Yanping and cut off the transportation between northern and eastern Fujian, causing disturbances to bandits from south of Fuzunxi, west of Shaxi, to Tinghang. Now Chiang Dingwen reported to Chiang Kai-shek on the 20th, assuming the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression. The senior generals who were summoned to the province a few days ago have also arrived at the designated locations, advancing towards the bandit areas from Nanfeng, Nancheng, Lichuan, Guangze, and Shaowu. Together with the troops of Lu Xingbang, Liu Heding, and Leng Xin, who attacked from Yanping, Youxi, and Zhangzhou towards the northwest, they formed a three-sided encirclement. The division commanders are all supervising the troops on the front line. It is reported that the fighting in the Shaxi area is quite fierce. Chen Cheng, the commander-in-chief of the northern route front, took Lichuan as an important place to connect Jiangxi and Fujian, and took the county's Hengcun, located in the Jianning Taining Guangchang hub, as the military center of Jiangxi and Fujian. Since he had recovered the place a few days ago, he has recently arranged everything there to facilitate the suppression. Therefore, the time to eliminate the bandits should not be far away.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Rectifies the Administrative Commissioner System</h3>
<p>Specifies Five Key Points for Handling Administration</p>
<p>Orders to the Provincial Governments of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters believe that the provinces and regions of our country are vast, and there is a separation between the provinces and counties. It is difficult to take care of both the upper and lower levels. Therefore, the commissioner system was created. Since its implementation, the results have been gradually apparent. The system is still young, and old habits have not been eliminated. There are still inevitable Tao-yins who are regarded as unimportant in the past. Regarding the measures for suppressing bandits and local politics, and the reorganization of local finances, the provincial government and its subordinate offices and departments all directly issue orders to the counties, so that the commissioners are isolated and cannot fulfill their supervisory duties. Therefore, five key points for correction have been specified, and yesterday they were ordered to the provincial governments of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi to follow, in order to promote administrative efficiency. The original order reads, "The provinces and regions of our country are vast, and there is a separation between the provinces and counties. It is difficult to take care of both the upper and lower levels. Therefore, the commissioner system was created, in order to innovate and improve local politics. The regulations for the organization of the Supervisory Commissioner's Office were promulgated in the headquarters for suppressing bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. The significance of its creation was clearly indicated in the instructions and documents. Since its implementation, the results have been gradually apparent, which proves that the establishment of this commissioner is in line with the needs of the political environment. The system is still young, and old habits have not been eliminated. There are still inevitable Tao-yins who are regarded as unimportant in the past. Regarding the measures for suppressing bandits and local politics, and the reorganization of local finances, the provincial government and its subordinate offices and departments directly issue orders to the counties, so that the commissioners are isolated and cannot fulfill their supervisory duties. The original intention of establishing officials and creating systems has been lost. Corrections should be made urgently to promote administrative efficiency. The key points are listed as follows: (1) The provincial government or the competent offices and departments shall order all counties in the province to undertake important matters uniformly, and must supervise the districts separately and complete them within a time limit. The administrative supervisory commissioners shall be separately ordered and notified to order the counties under their jurisdiction, and shall be responsible for supervising the handling separately. (For example, organizing Baojia, promoting education, and other time-sensitive matters.) (2) When the provincial government or the competent offices and departments encounter special matters that must be handled by one county under the jurisdiction of a certain administrative region, the supervisory commissioners shall be separately ordered and notified to order the county to follow, and shall supervise the progress. (For example, suppressing bandits and clearing the countryside, completing warehousing, reforming malpractices, and other special matters.) (3) When the provincial government or the competent offices and departments encounter interconnected matters that must be handled jointly by the counties under the jurisdiction of Supervisory Commissioner A and Supervisory Commissioner B, the respective supervisory commissioners shall be separately ordered and notified to order the respective counties to follow, and shall jointly supervise the progress. (For example, blockading bandit areas, clearing the countryside and suppressing bandits together, repairing provincial roads, and other matters related to each other.) (4) In the case of the above three circumstances, the respective county governments shall submit the handling situation to the administrative supervisory commissioner in charge, and report it to the provincial government, and inform the respective competent offices and departments. (5) The actual situation of local fiscal revenue and expenditure in each county shall be reported to the administrative supervisory commissioner in charge on a monthly basis for verification. In addition to the separate orders, the above five points shall be ordered to the provincial government to follow, and shall be forwarded to the subordinates to follow. This order" (February 23)</p>

<h3>Three Provincial River Associations Request Funds to Reorganize the Yellow River Embankment</h3>
<p>Statistics Show a Need for More Than 12 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The three provinces of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong are located in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, especially Shandong Province, which has the longest section. It has been many years since the course was changed, and the siltation is getting higher and higher. Every time there is a flood. It was not until the year before last that the three provinces had the organization of the Yellow River River Affairs Federation to plan for unified flood control and repair. Last year, the river breached in southern Hebei, submerging western Shandong. The Stone Village mouth is still not blocked. Now that the ice flood has passed and the flood season is coming, how to reorganize the entire embankment and how to arrange the flood control project are all important. Last year, the third annual meeting of the Three Provincial River Affairs Conference was held in Jinan. It was resolved that the three provincial river affairs bureaus should separately estimate the work and prepare a plan. It was collected at the Shandong River Affairs Bureau in Jinan and compiled into a whole plan. It was presented to the five provincial governments of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the Guidance Huai Committee, the Yangtze River Channel Engineering Committee, and the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, a total of nine agencies. The current dangerous situation of the Yellow River was stated, and it was difficult to avoid accidents without a thorough reorganization. The south can submerge Jiangsu and Anhui, and the north can submerge Hebei and Shandong. The harm caused by the turbid current will be several times greater than the river breach in southern Hebei last year. Please present the case to the central government for approval and allocate funds for reorganization as soon as possible, etc. As of now, the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have completed the survey and estimation, and the engineering plans have been collected in Jinan. The post-disaster water control project of the Yellow River in Hebei Province is 1.89 million yuan. The post-disaster project of the Yellow and Qin Rivers in Henan Province is 4,633,040 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen, and 2 hao. The dam maintenance project in Shandong Province is 6.4 million yuan, totaling 12,923,040 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen, and 2 hao. All the presentations and consultations of the Three Provincial River Affairs Federation to the five provincial governments and the four water conservancy agencies have already been issued by the Henan River Affairs Bureau separately. The original text is as follows: "Case investigation of the third regular meeting, proposed by Chen Ruzhen, director of the Henan River Affairs Bureau, Sun Qingze, director of the Hebei Yellow River River Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Lianjia, director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, that the association should submit to the five provincial governments of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong to request the central government to approve a huge amount of money to repair the embankments of the three provinces. The details are as follows: In the proposal, the embankments of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan are the screens of North China and the guarantee of the southeast, and are of great importance. However, they have been in disrepair for many years, the riverbed is getting higher and higher, and the embankment is getting lower and thinner. The dangerous situation is already precarious. After the autumn flood this year, the water was washed away, and the low places are even more so, resulting in many breaches, which is a warning in fact. If we do not seek remedy and reorganize properly, the disaster will be unimaginable in the future. It is better to prepare for the rain and repair in advance for safety, rather than breach the embankment and let the lives and property of hundreds of millions of people sink to the bottom, and then spend a lot of money to plan for blocking. The advantages and disadvantages are obvious. Ruzhen and others are responsible for keeping silent and feel uneasy. It is proposed that the association submit to the five provincial governments of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong to request the central government to approve a huge amount of money to actively repair and maintain the river defense and protect the people's livelihood. Is it appropriate? Please make a public decision, etc. The conference decided that the river affairs bureaus of each province should prepare plans and charts and send them to the association for compilation and presentation to the provincial governments and the competent authorities of the river affairs bureaus, and forward them to the central government for rapid handling, in order to facilitate river defense and protect the lives of the people, etc. The records were passed. The association has reviewed this case, and now the embankments of the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong are indeed getting lower and thinner. If we do not actively repair and maintain them, and there is any neglect, the south breach will inevitably take the Huai River into the Yangtze River. Not only the diversion and diversion plan, and the Yangtze River project, will be completely abandoned, but also the people of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu will suffer. The north breach will inevitably cut off the Pinghan Jinpu, cross the Wei River, and enter the sea through the canal. Not only the Haihe project for many years will be destroyed, but also the people of the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong will be harmed endlessly. It is now approved that the river affairs bureaus of the three provinces have prepared plans and charts, and have sent them to the agency one after another. The original plans and charts should be checked and presented to your government for approval and forwarding to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, and a huge amount of money should be allocated as soon as possible, so that they can be actively repaired and maintained as soon as possible, in order to maintain river affairs and protect the lives of the people. It is a public convenience. Sincerely presented to Han, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Yu, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, Liu, chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, Chen, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Liu, chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, and Li, chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission."</p>
<h3>Songjiang Buddhist Association Formally Established</h3>
<p>The Buddhist Association of this county, organized by layman Wu Bogeng and Buddhist monk Bi Yun, held its founding meeting at the Big Temple on the 25th. More than 100 monks and laymen attended.

<h3>Police Officer Arrested for On-site Investigation</h3>
<p>A Wang family in the fifth Tu of Caoxingsha was stolen. The Public Security Bureau of this county immediately sent Yang Shaoxian, a supervisor, to the countryside to conduct an on-site investigation with Chen Tingjie, a patrol officer of Caoxing. It is unknown how, when the boat passed through the Xinshi Town area of Fengxian County, Yang and Chen were found smoking in the boat by the eighth detachment of this county. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. The county government of this county welcomed them back to Songjiang and transferred them to the county court for investigation. The supervising officer Yang and the patrol officer Chen were ordered to post bail. The witnesses Wang Juxian and Wang Jushan continued to be interrogated.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Public Security Bureau Implements Retrenchment</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, in order to retrench the public security expenses of various counties and concentrate its efforts, ordered the public security bureaus of various counties to plan to cut and merge their subordinate public security organs. Li Wengong, the director of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, immediately planned and formulated a plan to reduce the urban and rural sub-bureaus to ten sub-bureaus, cutting six of the original sub-bureaus. Five sub-bureaus were cut in the rural areas. In the urban area, the second and fifth sub-bureaus were merged into the second sub-bureau, and the sixth sub-bureau was changed to the fifth sub-bureau. After the sub-bureaus were cut and merged, the general bureau will increase the patrol team to increase the defense force in the urban area.</p>
<h3>New Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Chamber of Commerce Take Office</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce of this county handled the second re-election on January 15 this year. Because the three elected executive committee members, Qian Sunqing, Chen Zhanru, and Cheng Jingtang, had doubts because the term of the original supervisory committee members had not expired, the newly elected executive and supervisory committee members have not taken office. The Chamber of Commerce had requested the court to explain that the supervisory committee members whose terms had not expired could resign from the name of the supervisory committee and take office as executive committee members. Yesterday (the 25th) was the date for the new and old executive and supervisory committee members of the association to take office. At 2 pm, the standing committee members were elected in the conference room. The county government sent Zhang Dezai to supervise the election. The election was supervised by Hua Shaochun, a member of the supervisory committee. As a result of the election, Yang Hanxi, Qian Sunqing, Cai Xiansan, Chen Zhanru, and Wu Shimei were elected as standing committee members, and Yang Hanxi was elected as the chairman of the standing committee. After the election, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Shooting Range Has Been Selected</h3>
<p>The National Government recently instructed all counties to select a large exercise field of 100 mu and a shooting range of 300 meters away. After the Wu County Government received the order, it immediately began to select them for the general election of the local defense corps in each district in the future. However, the area near the city is densely populated, and there is very little open space. Yesterday (24th), Xu Baoguang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, accompanied Lin Jun, the head of the first district, to inspect the southern countryside. When they chose the site of Yan City, it was still suitable for use as a shooting range. They immediately presented it to the county government for approval.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang to Complete the Zhencheng Road by Deadline</h3>
<p>The Zhencheng Road project has a pressing deadline. Previously, the Construction Department instructed the Zhenjiang County Government to complete the roadbed earthwork by the end of March. Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government, concerned that the agricultural season is approaching and the opportunity to recruit labor is fleeting, specifically telegraphed County Magistrate Ye to report the progress of the project and the date of completion within three days. Simultaneously, he urged all districts to actively proceed and ensure completion by the deadline.</p>
<h3>Yin Chuanling Accused of Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>Yin Chuanling, the head of the Sixth Autonomous District under the county, has recently been accused by several villagers of Baonian Township under his jurisdiction of dereliction of duty and fraud. They filed a criminal lawsuit with the court's prosecutor's office, requesting a warrant to summon Yin to court for investigation. This was approved, and the prosecutor issued a warrant. Yesterday morning, the court convened, but only the plaintiffs appeared. Yin did not comply with the summons even by the afternoon. Only the plaintiffs were interrogated, and the court ordered their dismissal, pending another summons for Yin Chuanling to be brought in for questioning and further investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing County Has Prepared Funds to Purchase and Store Grain</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Grain Storage has been allocated grain storage quotas to the various townships and public offices by the county magistrate based on acreage. However, due to poor harvests, it has been impossible to collect the quotas. The County Grain Storage Management Committee considers grain storage a crucial policy for famine preparedness and has prepared over 8,000 yuan to appoint committee members to purchase 3,000 dan of grain in Wuxi. It has also been decided to build additional granaries for grain storage. The County Government Construction Technology Officer has been commissioned to design and construct them.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Economic Survey of Guangxi Province (II) by Qian Jiaxuan</h3>
<p>Early the next morning, we went to see Mr. Li Delin. Mr. Li talked about the economic prospects of Guangxi. He seemed particularly concerned about Guangxi's import surplus. Because Guangxi has a population of 12 million, all clothing relies on supplies from outside the province. Taking foreign cloth as an example, assuming each person wears one set of clothes per year, averaging two yuan, the outflow would be 20 million. "We would also like to use high tax rates to restrict the import of foreign goods," Mr. Li said, "but on the one hand, it easily causes misunderstandings with neighboring provinces, and on the other hand, it provokes opposition from merchants and the public, so there is no good solution." Mr. Li's words are worthy of our attention, because the huge import surplus is not only a serious problem for Guangxi, but also a serious problem for all of China. However, in our view, it seems that compensating for the import surplus cannot be solved solely by relying on protective tariffs. Because even if we build very high tariff barriers, foreigners can still rely on the protection of unequal treaties to open factories and manufacture goods in China. Moreover, if we do not have substitutes ourselves, high tariffs will ultimately be borne by consumers.</p>
<p>After leaving Mr. Li's residence, we returned to the hotel. Soon, Mr. Li Li entrusted a friend from the YMCA, Mr. Liu, to see us. Mr. Liu is an executive in the children's department of the Hong Kong YMCA and has reportedly lived in Hong Kong for over ten years. First, we hired a Taxi (street car) to tour the city for a week. Hong Kong's commercial vehicles are all parked in the center of the road or in prosperous market areas. You don't have to go to a car dealership to call one; you can hire them anywhere. But the fares are very high, starting at forty cents, about one Hong Kong dollar every ten minutes or so. There is an automatic pointer on the car that automatically points to the fare based on the length of time. We sat for less than half an hour, and the pointer had already pointed to two dollars and fifty cents. This was really too expensive, so we got off midway and took a public bus to tour the Peak Tram. The Peak Tram is a major transportation facility between Hong Kong Island and the mountain, and is also known as one of Hong Kong's famous attractions. The road was reportedly suggested and built by an Englishman, A. Finlay Smith. Construction began in 1885 and was completed in 1888. It officially opened to traffic in May of that year. In 1905, the Peak Tramway Co. Ltd. was established. Initially, the round trip took nine minutes and there were no stops. Now, although it is on the same route, it stops at six stations along the way: Garden Road, Kennedy Road, Bowen Road, May Road, Barker Road, and Peak Road, and it only takes seven and a half minutes. Also, when the car was first put into use, the body was made of wood and felt quite heavy. Later, steel cars were used. Since 1927, specially made new vehicles have been used, each of which can carry 53 passengers. On average, about 3,000 tourists visit every day. Six years ago, the car was still powered by steam, but now it is powered by electricity. The entire car is raised and lowered using a steel cable about 5,000 feet long, hence the name cable car. Since its opening, there has never been an accident. The cable car is divided into first and second class. The first-class fare for one trip up or down is thirty cents per person. After we got on the car, we sat in the first-class car. Who knew that at this time, the guide Mr. Liu secretly pulled our sleeves and said in a low voice: That i for foiregners only (that is, only for foreigners to ride). We felt very strange when we heard it. Why don't Chinese people even have the qualifications to ride first-class trams! So my companion Mr. Han replied to him very humorously, Yes, we are just foreigner (we are foreigners!). Regardless of the consequences, he sat down in first class. The fact immediately proved that first and second class were not divided between Chinese and foreigners. This was just Mr. Liu's misunderstanding. Mr. Liu himself was also embarrassed because it turned out that it was also his first time riding. The summit of the mountain is 1,500 meters above the ground. Overlooking the entire island, everything is in sight. We lingered on the summit for about ten minutes, and then took the cable car down the mountain and returned to the hotel, preparing to take the Hong Kong-Guangdong night ferry to Guangzhou tonight.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is 89 miles from Guangzhou by sea, and the voyage takes about eight hours. We boarded the ship at 9 pm, and the ship sailed at 12 o'clock. When the night ferry left Hong Kong, we looked out over the entire island on the deck and saw the electric torches shining brightly, like a sparkling crystal mountain. It was really beautiful. We got tired of watching the night view of Hong Kong Island, went back to the boat and slept. When we woke up, we had already arrived in Guangzhou. This voyage can be said to be the most enjoyable one in our life, because the dryness and boredom of the journey were completely replaced by a dream in the black sweet land. But there is one thing to remember on the Hong Kong-Guangdong wheel. Our cabin mate was a Cantonese man, Mr. Wang, who was studying at some school in Hong Kong. This Mr. Wang always said Sure or Of Course in every two sentences. After we exchanged names with him, Mr. Han asked him if he was a member of the YMCA. His answer was Sure why not! We were really taken aback when we heard this affirmative reply. Only later did we realize that it was an exception not to join the YMCA when studying in Hong Kong. The next day, when the boat approached the Guangzhou pier, many coolies carrying luggage saw that we were foreigners, so they tried to fleece us. Because Mr. Wang was Cantonese, we asked him if the compensation demanded by the coolies was too high, hoping that he could bargain for us. Who knew that this Mr. Wang simply replied, Sure, too much, and left on his own. We had to use half-gestures to hand over the luggage to the porters and transport it to the New Asia Hotel. Speaking of the New Asia Hotel, it is really worthy of our special praise, because most of the hotels in big Chinese cities hide dirt and accept filth, and are places where smoking, gambling, and prostitution gather. These improper businesses often form the bulk of their income. Even if the official authorities want to prohibit them, they are too deeply rooted to change, and they only do lip service. But the New Asia Hotel in Guangzhou is really an exception. It absolutely prohibits smoking, gambling, and calling prostitutes. They have posted such notices everywhere. Anyone with the above three hobbies is requested not to patronize. This clean air is something that we cannot breathe in any hotel in China. As for the elegance of the rooms and the thoughtfulness of the hospitality, those are just minor matters. So here we are willing to post a free advertisement for them. If you are a newcomer to Guangzhou, staying at the New Asia is really the most suitable.</p>
<p>After arriving in Guangzhou, we went to visit Mr. Zhang Renmin, Li Zongren's chief of staff. Mr. Zhang asked us to stay in Guangzhou for a few days. He said that the Fourth Army Headquarters had recently invited a German doctor, Dr. Schneider. They ordered an adjutant to send us and the German doctor to Nanning together. We didn't want to delay in Guangzhou too much, but on the one hand, there were many language barriers to go to Guangxi, and the route was too unfamiliar. At the same time, Mr. Lei Binnan also advised us to wait for the adjutant to travel together, which would be more convenient. So we had to stay in Guangzhou temporarily. During these two days, we took the opportunity to visit several friends in Guangzhou: Mr. Zhang Qiaomen (Director of the Statistics Section of the Guangdong Provincial Government) and Mr. Chen Dacai (Director of the Guangdong Investigation and Statistics Bureau), and asked them for several Guangdong economic survey forms for reference in Guangxi.</p>
<p>On July 20, Qiu Jiancheng, the adjutant sent by the Fourth Army to send us, came to the New Asia Hotel to inform us that it had been decided to leave Guangzhou for Wuzhou at 10 am the next morning, and told us to prepare our luggage. At nine o'clock the next day, Adjutant Qiu came. We first moved to the "Foreign Boat" (Guangdong people)</p>
<p>The appellation Motor Boat) crossed the Guangsan Road Station on the opposite bank, and from there took a train to Sanshui, and then from Sanshui took the Hong Kong-Wuzhou express boat to Wuzhou. The train departed at 11:10 am and arrived at the Sanshui River Estuary at 2 pm. As soon as we got off the train, we saw a large group of barefoot women in rough clothes, shouting and shouting, surrounding us and snatching our luggage. Fortunately, we were escorted by someone and were not besieged. They told me that these were all boat women who came to solicit business. Later, what we saw traveling in the interior of Guangxi was that not only was the work of rowing boats done by women, but even the dock coolies were almost entirely women, and men were rarely seen. We became accustomed to it and were not surprised. We have discussed with several friends the reasons why female labor is particularly developed in Guangdong and Guangxi. The general historical origin is that the sons of Guangdong and Guangxi participated in many wars in China in the past, and many strong men died in the gullies, so women naturally had to participate in production labor. On the other hand, the custom of men in Guangdong and Guangxi to take concubines is particularly prevalent. Their so-called "concubines" are by no means the so-called "aunties" in Shanghai who are pampered and privileged, but at the same time they are also purchases of cheap labor. This is a disguised form of female labor. Sometimes a man's labor often cannot maintain the life of a family, so his wife and daughter have to do some odd jobs to supplement the family. For example, the incense workers in Liuzhou have an average of three months of unemployment every year. At this time, they rely entirely on their wives to fetch water to maintain their lives. This is probably an economic basis for the continued development of female labor.</p>
<p>After arriving in Sanshui, we transferred to the Hong Kong-Wuzhou express boat. The boat departed at 5 pm and arrived in Wuzhou at 9 am the next morning. This was truly entering Guangxi. Wuzhou has always been known as "the Shanghai of Guangxi." In fact, Wuzhou's importance to Guangxi is even greater than Shanghai's importance to China. It is not only the passage from Guangxi to Guangdong, but also the center of foreign trade for the three provinces of Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Geographically and militarily, Wuzhou controls the throat of the West and Two Rivers. Economically, it is a gathering area for commerce, industry, and finance in Guangxi Province. The city of Wuzhou was established before, but the municipal government was abolished in the 20th year of the Republic of China and returned to county rule. However, the current Municipal Public Security Bureau and Municipal Works Bureau are still directly under the Nanning Provincial Government. Regarding Wuzhou, we will have a more detailed description later.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Bank Association Cables Roosevelt's Original Text</h3>
<p>Since US President Roosevelt implemented a monetary policy to lower the price of the US dollar in order to raise the price of silver, China, as a silver-using country, faces the crisis of silver gradually flowing out of the country. On the 20th, the Bank Association urgently cabled Roosevelt, asking him to pay attention. The association believes that this matter involves international negotiations, and the content of the telegram is strictly kept secret. A reporter from Shenshi News Agency learned the original English draft of the telegram from a certain aspect of the banking community yesterday. The following is a brief translation:</p>
<h3>Telegram to Roosevelt Original Text</h3>
<p>The original text roughly stated: The colleagues of the banking industry in this city respectfully express their greetings to your Excellency, the President. Since your Excellency implemented the recovery plan, the price of the US dollar has fallen, and the prices in your country have indeed risen, and the number of unemployed has gradually decreased. However, the prices of our country's products will continue to fall, and silver will inevitably flow out, creating opportunities for speculators. Moreover, our country has suffered from natural disasters and man-made disasters for thousands of years, and the people's lives have fallen into deep water and hot fire. If your country's silver purchase policy continues, our country's farmers will feel even more distressed, and international exchange rates will also be extremely chaotic. Both sides' economies will suffer adversely. Our country's banking industry colleagues sincerely hope that your Excellency, the President, will observe our country's situation and take prudent steps on the price of silver, so as not to suddenly rise and cause difficulties in exchange rates. We hereby send this telegram and respectfully ask for your consideration. Shanghai Bank Association, number.</p>
<h3>No Reply Expected</h3>
<p>The Bank Association's telegram was sent out on the evening of the 20th. As of last night, Roosevelt had not replied to Shanghai. According to a certain important person in the banking community yesterday, they received a private telegram from the US, which roughly stated that President Luo had not made any statement on the Bank Association's telegram. What the outcome is, it is difficult to understand. It is expected that there will be no reply to this matter, because the telegram was not sent through diplomatic channels, and President Roosevelt has no obligation to reply. However, President Luo will at least pay close attention to the interests of our country based on this telegram.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Talk Yesterday</h3>
<p>The United States Will Inevitably Raise the Price of Silver</p>
<p>The First Draft of the Constitution Will Be Published on March 1</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, left Beijing the night before and went to Wuxi for sightseeing. He arrived in Shanghai the night before. Yesterday morning, Mr. Sun met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence and gave a talk. The following is a record of what Mr. Sun said:</p>
<h3>Different Positions of China and the United States</h3>
<p>Sun Ke believes that the United States' raising of the price of silver is due to the different positions of China and the United States. Our country has no so-called countermeasures, because the initiator of this matter is not us but the United States. The United States regards silver as currency, and raising the price of silver is raising the price of its own country's goods to lower the price of gold. The United States is a gold-using country, and lowering the price of gold is raising the price of goods. This is very obvious. As for why the United States suddenly wants to raise the price of silver, it is because it is being lobbied by silver miners to seek benefits for themselves. The reason they hold is that raising the price of silver and lowering the price of gold can boost China's purchasing power and absorb a large amount of American goods. Who knows that this one-sided reason is completely wrong. Because China uses silver as its standard, the price of silver increases, the price of currency also rises, and the price of local products falls. At this time of commercial downturn, raising the price of silver suddenly will have an even greater impact. China is in this situation, and it is doubtful whether it can increase its purchasing power. Therefore, this move by the United States is completely a mistake in economic ideals.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for King of Belgium Today</h3>
<p>Held at 11:30 am</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Others Will Participate in Person</p>
<p>King Albert I of Belgium suffered an unfortunate death, which shocked the world. The memorial service for the King of Belgium in this city is scheduled to be held at 11:30 am today in St. Joseph's Church on Tianzhutang Street. The ceremony will be a Requiem Mass of the Catholic Church, presided over by the Belgian Ambassador Ji Youmu, with Father and Bishop Hui as the main celebrants. Ambassadors and consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai and military attachés of the army and navy will all participate uniformly at that time. Mayor Wu of this city, Security Director Yang Hu, Foreign Affairs Director Yu Ming, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, and senior naval officers will not only send wreaths, but will also participate on time. The Belgian Ambassador will go to Beijing in the evening after the memorial service in this city to preside over the memorial service for the King of Belgium to be held in Beijing on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Must Be Realized and Cannot Be Remedied</h3>
<p>It is heard that this movement in the United States is unlikely to be changed when it is realized. There has been considerable progress, and the plan is to raise the price of silver to the ratio of gold to silver becoming one to twelve. The desire is extravagant. The current price ratio of gold to silver in the United States is one to more than thirty. Now, if they want to raise the price by such a large amount, even if the banks in this port have cabled the United States to stop it, it may be difficult to achieve results. Because the United States is quite determined to raise the price of silver, if the price of silver is raised in the future, China's silver will flow out, and hard currency will inevitably be scarce. If it is said that the export of silver is prohibited, I am afraid that it will not be effective, because China's national defense is not strict and there is no way to prevent it.</p>
<h3>Little Impact on International Relations</h3>
<p>As for the relationship between raising the price of silver and the international community, because all countries are gold-using countries, there is little impact. Raising the price of silver is equivalent to raising the price of goods, so the interests of gold-using countries and silver-using countries are completely opposite. The United States is a national economic country and will not take into account the interests of others, so there is nothing to do. The London Silver Price Agreement's slow approval is also useless. The National Economic Conference has not yet heard of any discussion on this matter. However, the economic experts of the National Economic Conference should study this issue. The government, in addition to the bankers in Shanghai have expressed their views, there is no other remedy. I am afraid that this move by the banking community may not be able to change the United States' intention.</p>
<h3>First Draft of the Constitution to be Published on Schedule</h3>
<p>Later, it was said that the first draft of the Constitution has been completed and will be published on March 1 (Thursday). After publication, it is hoped that the people of the country can study and criticize it, so that the Legislative Yuan's plenary meeting can revise and improve it, complete the second draft, and submit it to the Central Political Conference for submission to the National Assembly in April next year for approval. There are three points in this first draft that are worthy of study and are more noteworthy: (1) In the central organization, such as during the adjournment of the National Assembly, a National Committee is established to inherit its duties. For example, when the Control Yuan has impeachments of the President and other important cases, it can be requested that the Committee take over and temporarily convene the National Assembly to resolve it. In peacetime, it is equivalent to the position of a elder, prepared for government consultation. Its nature is similar to that of the Japanese elder, but Japan is not within the provisions of the Constitution, and a part of it represents the National Assembly; (2) Regarding local organizations, provinces are not called local but purely central administrative regions, and cities and counties are called local, that is, they are stipulated as units of local autonomy. In the future, when the National Assembly elects representatives, the units stipulated above will be used, and each unit will elect a representative. However, cities that are close to the capital will have other methods; (3) Educational funding has always been only one thousand several million yuan. This time, after a long discussion, either a general provision or a clear provision was made. As a result, everyone believed that a clear provision was more appropriate. Therefore, the first draft stipulates that the educational funding budget accounts for 15% of the central general budget and 30% of the local general budget. Taking the central funding of 800 million as an example, the annual educational funding can account for about 160 million yuan. Compared with the past, it is a ratio of tens to one. If this is stipulated, educational funding will never be a problem in the future, and with sufficient funding, promoting education can also reduce difficulties.</p>
<h3>New Province Problems Rectify Officialdom</h3>
<p>As for the Xinjiang issue, in fact, the central government does need to send senior officials to go there. However, the reason for the Xinjiang unrest is mistakenly believed to be a religious issue, which is inaccurate. Its biggest reason is due to poor officialdom, harsh government, and miscellaneous taxes, which aroused resentment, led to desperate measures, and resistance to the government. Coupled with the constant disturbances of Ma Zhongying and others, it became even worse. Most of the people in the province are Hui, and the officials are all Han Chinese. After the instigation of those behind the scenes, it is believed to be a religious issue. Therefore, the current method of pacification should first rectify the officialdom and relieve their suffering, then the root cause will be eliminated and the situation will not expand.</p>
<h3>Absolutely No Such Thing as Electing a Premier</h3>
<p>When the reporter asked Mr. Sun about the record of the central government's election of a premier as published in the Great American Evening News, he said that this matter was not accurate. This is stipulated in the party constitution, and if there is any change, it will be a matter of revising the general chapter. It seems that there will be no such proposal at this time, so I have never heard of it.</p>
<h3>Kong and Song Met Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Exchanged Views on the Silver Agreement</p>
<p>Summoned Banking Community for Talks Today</p>
<p>Dagon News Agency reported that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi believes that the US government will recoin silver coins and raise the price of silver, which will have a great impact on the interests of our country. In addition to carefully considering the Shanghai Bank Association's request to postpone the approval of the silver agreement, the silver agreement was signed by former Minister of Finance Song Ziwen when he represented our country at the London Economic Conference. How should this matter be handled? It is necessary to discuss it in detail with former Minister of Finance Song. Yesterday morning, Minister of Finance Kong drove from his residence on West Innes Road to Qi Qi Road to meet with Mr. Song and exchange views on all aspects of the silver agreement. The meeting ended at 11:20 am. What the result is, it is still difficult to find out for a while. In order to carefully handle the silver agreement issue, Minister of Finance Kong has decided to summon important figures in the banking community for talks separately from today (26th) to solicit opinions for in-depth study. As for the leaders of the banking community, Li Fuxun, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Jiyun, etc., have decided to present the advantages and disadvantages to Minister of Finance Kong and continue to protest the increase in the price of silver.</p>
<h3>American Cotton and Wheat Continue to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>American loan cotton and wheat have recently been shipped to Shanghai. This reporter wanted to understand the modification of the cotton contract, so he went to various parties to inquire. The news obtained is described as follows:</p>
<h3>Contract Modification Issues</h3>
<p>The total amount of cotton purchased by our country from the United States with loans is 400,000 tons, totaling 800,000 bales, worth 40 million US dollars. The contract deadline is the end of June this year, and all must be purchased. Since the opening of shipment, the price of cotton has been inconsistent, such as selling it at a loss, so the number of shipments to China is very small, not even one-fifteenth. The contract period is only four months, and it will be difficult to sell all of it by then. Therefore, our country has asked the US government to modify the contract. According to the reporter's investigation from various aspects, the points for requesting modification are: first, extend the contract period; second, it is difficult to purchase and transport all of the cotton due to domestic needs and market prices. Some of the cotton will be converted into machinery needed by our country's industrial factories. It is heard that this matter is being negotiated in the United States.</p>
<h3>Two More Batches of American Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>American cotton has been loaded since November last year, and it has been more than three months since then. However, only 6 million yuan worth of cotton has been shipped, and the number of cotton that has been shipped and is on the way is not large. The other day, more than 700 pieces were loaded by the Pacific Company's Belanger ship and have been unloaded at Zhanghuabang. There is also another batch, which was also loaded by the company's Brantford wheel and is expected to be imported on Monday, with more than 1,000 pieces. Both batches of American cotton were purchased by foreign merchants in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wheat and Flour Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>The total amount of American wheat and flour is 300,000 tons. Since mid-December last year, it has been loaded from Portland. As of yesterday, a total of 14 ships had arrived in Shanghai and Nanjing. The last ship loaded by the Asia wheel is still being unloaded. Yesterday, we received a telegram that the 15th ship, Jefferson City, carried a mixture of 8,275 tons of wheat and flour, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. There are still the 16th to 19th ships, a total of four ships, which together carry 30,000 tons of wheat and are also on the way. It is expected that they can all arrive in Shanghai for unloading before March 5. In total, there are 19 ships of American wheat, 140,000 tons, plus flour, etc., worth 10 million yuan in national currency. By March 5, the American wheat side has already been able to transport nearly half of it, and there are still 160,000 tons of wheat and flour, all of which will be loaded by the end of June.</p>
<h3>New British Envoy to China, Sir Miles Lampson, Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Chinese and British Representatives Prepare to Greet Him Upon Arrival</p>
<p>Will Rest in Shanghai for a Week Before Proceeding to Beijing</p>
<p>The newly appointed British Ambassador to China, Sir Miles Lampson, along with his wife and three daughters, as well as Sir De Sausmarez, who went to Hong Kong to welcome them, will arrive in Shanghai this morning aboard the British company's "Chitral" steamer. They will disembark at the Hongkou Wharf. Those present to welcome them will include representatives of the National Government, British Chargé d'Affaires Mr. Ingram, British Consul-General in Shanghai Mr. Brenan, and British Assessor Mr. Moss. Currently, due to the mourning period for the late King Albert of Belgium, all welcoming ceremonies will be kept simple. As for public banquets, there is only one invitation from a joint committee formed by the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and the China Association, aiming to allow the new envoy to meet with leaders of the British community. Since the new envoy will have many official and private matters to attend to in Nanjing and Peiping (Beijing) after his arrival, delaying the meeting would cause unnecessary delays. The envoy will stay in Shanghai for a week before proceeding to Nanjing to present his credentials. He will then travel north to Peiping around March 6th or 7th. Sir Miles Lampson and his wife will reside at the British Consulate-General, while his daughters will stay at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Envoy to China Requests Leave to Return Home</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Today to Await Ship</p>
<p>Counsellor to Temporarily Assume Duties</p>
<p>Portuguese Envoy to China, Mr. João de Lacerda, has requested leave to return to his country. On the 23rd, he departed from Peiping with his entourage, taking the Shanghai-Peiping through train south. They arrived in the capital the day before yesterday. Because of his imminent return to Portugal, he stayed in Beijing to visit and bid farewell to figures such as the Premier of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Jingwei. He plans to stay in Beijing for a day or two, and will arrive in Shanghai today to handle matters in Shanghai and await his ship home. This morning, according to news from the Portuguese Consulate, the envoy's return to Portugal is not due to any urgent business. Having been away from his country for a long time, he has requested leave to return and report on the situation in China. He is scheduled to return to his post in six months. During the envoy's absence, all duties will be temporarily assumed by the Counsellor of the embassy, Mr. Sacramento.</p>
<h3>American Assessor in China, Mr. Prentiss, Relinquishes Post Yesterday</h3>
<p>Known for His Impartiality During Ten Years in Office</p>
<p>Mr. Brian Presents Souvenir</p>
<p>According to the "China Press", President Roosevelt recently appointed Mr. Helmick to replace the current American Assessor in China, Mr. Prentiss. Mr. Prentiss's tenure reached its tenth anniversary on February 25th, so he officially relinquished his post today (the 25th). However, he will continue to handle all affairs in the office until the new assessor takes office. Mr. Prentiss has lived in Shanghai for ten years and has a wide circle of friends. He is expected to reside in Shanghai. During his tenure, he was known for his impartiality in judging cases. The American Bar Association of the Far East has scheduled a meeting at the American Assessor's office tomorrow, where the chairman of the association, Mr. Brian, will present Mr. Prentiss with a souvenir on behalf of the association.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Plan to Promote Domestic Goods Nationwide</h3>
<p>Organizing Introduction Centers and a Joint Office</p>
<p>Planning to Establish China National Products Companies Nationwide</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in recent years, the Chinese people have been working diligently to promote domestic goods. In addition to striving to produce goods to meet the needs of all sectors, manufacturers have also formed the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, which has established introduction centers to fulfill its responsibility for promotion and introduction. Furthermore, a China National Products Company has been established in Shanghai to centrally sell general merchandise, and its business is thriving. However, due to its limited scope, it is difficult to reach the entire country. Recognizing this, manufacturers have jointly organized the China National Products Company Introduction Center Joint Office, planning to establish National Products Companies throughout the country to expand sales. They have also made special arrangements with banks to regulate finances. The organization has now been established, and directors have been appointed to be responsible for planning and implementation. Yesterday, a reporter met with Mr. Cai Shengbai, Director of the office and General Manager of the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, who provided detailed information on the organization and its implementation plan. The following is a summary:</p>
<h3>Internal Organization</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Cai, the China National Products Company Introduction Center National Joint Office, under the guidance of the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, is jointly organized by various domestic goods factories, the China National Products Company, domestic goods introduction centers, and banks. Currently, dozens of entities have joined, including the China Chemical Industry Society and the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory. A founding meeting has been held, and the following directors have been elected: Chairman Fang Yexian, Managing Directors Cai Shengbai, Shi Jiu'ao, Fang Jiangge, and Ren Shigang, and Directors Zhang Gongquan, Ye Youcai, Xie Bingru, and Pan Yangyao, who will be responsible for planning. In addition to the Director, the internal organization includes four sections: Finance, Management, Procurement, and Audit. The expenses are covered by tiered contributions from each member, with Class A paying 60 yuan per month, Class B 40 yuan, Class C 20 yuan, and Class D 10 yuan. If there is a shortfall, the members will contribute proportionally according to their class. Furthermore, local China National Products Company introduction centers should contribute 5% of their profits as a fund for the office, in addition to membership fees.</p>
<h3>Business Regulations</h3>
<p>The business regulations of the office are as follows: (1) Planning and establishing China National Products Companies and domestic goods introduction centers in various locations; (2) Jointly organizing factories as members and signing agreements to supply goods to China National Products Companies and domestic goods introduction centers in various locations; (3) Making special arrangements with banks to regulate the finances of both production and sales; (4) Auditing and supervising the business of China National Products Companies and domestic goods introduction centers in various locations; (5) Acting as an agent for China National Products Companies and domestic goods introduction centers in various locations to purchase various domestic goods and local products. If commercial leaders in various locations wish to organize their own National Products Companies, they can consult with the office in advance for approval and then raise their stipulated capital. At least one-third of the capital must be in cash for circulation. All goods can be supplied by the office and paid for after they are sold. Goods from non-member factories can also be entrusted to the office for purchase. However, a deputy manager will be dispatched by the office to supervise the business, and there will be a designated bank to advance funds. Therefore, with one share of capital, it is possible to conduct ten shares of business. Merchants can conduct the maximum amount of business with the minimum amount of capital, and the products of each factory can expand their sales. This is truly a move with multiple benefits.</p>

<h3>Joint Marketing by Chinese Yarn Manufacturers</h3>
<p>An organization for joint marketing will be formed</p>
<p>Last year, Chinese yarn factories were affected by the war in North China and the encroachment of Japanese yarn. The sales of yarn in the Tianjin market were sluggish, and the inventory of yarn piled up, totaling more than 100,000 bales. Although the factories once reduced working hours and tightened up in order to maintain operations, the reduction of working hours was only a temporary measure. Clearing the inventory of yarn was not a fundamental solution. Recognizing this, the Cotton Industry Control Association advocated finding ways to clear the inventory of yarn to stabilize yarn prices. At the same time, it also planned to organize a marketing organization. However, since the Cotton Industry Control Association is a government agency, it was inconvenient to handle it directly. It was decided that the major yarn factories should automatically organize a marketing company. The preparations have been underway, and it will be formally established soon. The participants include more than a dozen major manufacturers such as Wing On, Shen Xin, Pu Yi, Tong Yi, Da Feng, Min Sheng, and Long Mao. For this organization, each major yarn factory will temporarily assign one or two people to take care of and preside over it. After the inventory of yarn is allocated, each factory will be responsible for marketing it to other ports. It is understood that the purpose of this organization is to regulate market prices and facilitate yarn sales. After its establishment, it will exist permanently so that it can be contacted at any time to respond to necessary situations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Arima to Return Home Next Month</h3>
<p>Plans to Visit Beijing Again Before Departure</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Arima Akira, previously visited Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Jingwei and inquire about certain matters.

It is also heard that Chairman Huang Fu of the Peiping Political Council also intends to go south to make representations to the government.</p>
<h3>Disabled Anti-Japanese Refugees Request Relief</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Municipal Government and Relief Association</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Sends Representatives to Donate 200 Yuan</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, our patriotic compatriots went to join the volunteer army to charge and kill the enemy, which was a surging trend. At that time, it did give the enemy a major blow. However, in addition to those who died on the battlefield, there were many others who returned disabled. Those with broken arms and twisted feet were in extremely tragic conditions. Recently, more than 30 wounded heroes, including Wang Zhenqiu, came to Shanghai to seek help from Deputy Commander Zhang (Xueliang) and Zhu Ziqiao because their lives were difficult to maintain. The details of the events are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Petitioning the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the representatives, including Wang Zhenqiu, presented a petition to Deputy Commander Zhang (Xueliang) and Zhu Ziqiao, requesting assistance. Three representatives, Wang Zhenqiu, Dai Sirong, and Huan Zhenhai, went to the city center to petition Mayor Wu for assistance at around 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. They were received by Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. The representatives immediately stated their intention to request assistance. Mr. Yu comforted them and said that the municipal government was unable to provide relief. They could seek assistance from charitable organizations in the city, as the municipal government had funds to donate to various charitable organizations, and he believed that these organizations would be able to find a solution. The representatives were satisfied with the response and left.</p>
<h3>Requesting Relief from Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the representatives went to the Northeastern Refugee Relief Association in Renji Hall on Yunnan Road and presented a petition for assistance. The original text reads: "To the esteemed Association, we, Sirong and others, were indignant at the September 18th Incident in our hometown, where the Japanese used force to occupy our Liaoning, realizing their ambition to gain an inch. Recalling that the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen, we, in our grief, rose up to resist the enemy, hoping to save the country from danger. Fortunately, our compatriots have not lost their conscience and have organized resistance, repeatedly crushing the fierce flames and giving them heavy blows. Although the enemy suffered heavy losses, we ran out of ammunition and reinforcements, and were unable to support ourselves, and ultimately failed. We are deeply saddened. Although our comrades were unable to die for the country, they all returned seriously injured. We have now been clearly dismissed by the Peiping Military Branch and sent back to our hometown, but our families in our hometown have all fallen into the hands of the enemy. Where can we go? Shall we be killed by the enemy and return to the hands of the thieves? It seems that there is no such reason in human sentiment and conscience. We, more than 30 disabled comrades, cannot think of a plan. We want to beg our compatriots for help. We are ashamed that we could not die on the battlefield and dare not have extravagant hopes. We want to make a living by labor, but unfortunately, we are unable to do so due to broken arms and twisted feet. We thought that there were many factories and a large population in Shanghai, or there would be a place to stand. Therefore, we led more than 30 disabled comrades to Shanghai. However, we are unfamiliar with the place and have no means of turning around. In this situation, we are no different from refugees. We have no choice but to ask your association to grant relief. We have no home to return to and cannot survive. Compared with refugees, we are even more distressed. We hope that your association will treat us equally and rescue us from the depths of misery. This is to inform you and ask for your consideration. Representatives Wang Zhenqiu, Dai Enrong, Yuan Zhenhai, etc."</p>
<h3>Zhang Donates Funds for Support</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, a reporter from the New News Agency went to visit the wounded heroes' residence and was received by Dai Enrong. According to him, "We were indignant at the barbarity of the Japanese invaders, who invaded our homeland and killed our compatriots. Therefore, we joined the front line to resist the enemy. We are only ashamed that we could not die for the country and unfortunately were injured and became social waste. After we recovered from our injuries and were discharged from the hospital, the Peiping Branch of the Military Council clearly ordered us to be discharged and sent back to our hometown. However, our hometown has been occupied by the enemy, so we had no choice but to come to Shanghai to beg for help in South China. This morning, Mr. Mi Chunlin from Deputy Commander Zhang's side sent 200 yuan for living expenses. However, our original intention in seeking help was to find possible work as a substitute for livelihood. We are determined not to rely on our compatriots with our disabled bodies. Therefore, we have agreed to keep this money as capital. If our lives can be maintained or if we do not need this money, we will donate it to other refugees to show mutual assistance among compatriots."</p>
<h3>Rural Areas on the Verge of Bankruptcy, Urgent Need to Establish Farmers' Bank</h3>
<p>Ningbo Native Association Sends Letter to Yinxian County Government Suggesting</p>
<p>Ningbo merchants in Shanghai, Cai Renchu and Dong Jing'an, are concerned about the decline of rural areas and the extreme hardship of farmers in Ningbo in recent years. If relief is not sought, bankruptcy is inevitable. Furthermore, although the Yinxian County Government has discussed the establishment of a farmers' bank, it has not been implemented for a long time. Yesterday, they specially requested the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai to propose that the government and merchants jointly organize the bank to make it easier to proceed. The association will inform the Yinxian County Government of the situation. It is heard that the county government has scheduled a meeting on March 9th to convene representatives from various relevant groups and enthusiastic gentry and merchants to discuss implementation measures. The following is an excerpt of the correspondence:</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association Suggests</h3>
<p>Respected Sir, according to the statement presented to our association by our directors Cai Renchu and Dong Jing'an, the rural areas of Ningbo have been on the verge of bankruptcy in recent years. If we do not seek relief urgently, the hidden dangers are worrying. The Yinxian County Government had previously discussed the establishment of a farmers' bank, but it has not been implemented to this day. However, this move is indeed an important plan to relieve rural areas. If the rural areas are consolidated and the finances are abundant, all industries may be able to rely on it to turn around. If the official funds are difficult to raise, the establishment of a farmers' bank can be changed to a joint venture between the government and merchants, which will be easier to proceed. If the county government believes it is feasible, Renchu and others are willing to work hard to achieve it. We plan to forward the letter to consult with you. After checking the information, the decline of rural areas in Ningbo in recent years has become an undeniable fact. It is essential to establish a farmers' bank to circulate finances. According to the previous information, we are urgently writing to County Magistrate Chen for his review, selection, and implementation to benefit the farmers. It is not a small matter. We hope you will check and reply. Sincerely, Ningbo Native Association.</p>
<h3>Yinxian County Government Replies</h3>
<p>Respected Sir, we have received your letter stating that your association directors Cai Renchu and Dong Jing'an intend to establish a farmers' bank in our county through a joint venture between the government and merchants. We have received it. The proposal to establish a farmers' bank in our county has been around for a long time. It began in 1929, when local gentry were invited to hold a preparatory meeting and formulate a joint venture method between the government and merchants. At that time, the issue of interest protection and official stock allocation could not be resolved, which led to delays. In 1930, a method was proposed to raise funds for the agricultural bank by levying small industry and land, but it was not approved by the provincial government. In 1931, the province issued a method to bring agricultural bank shares under the land tax, but the township and town heads refused to take responsibility, arguing that it would increase the burden on the people. After several meetings, no agreement was reached on the amount and term of the levy. Therefore, this important measure to relieve the rural economy has not yet been realized, which is deeply regrettable. The government's plan to complete this task is to operate jointly with government and merchants, which is more feasible. However, in addition to the approximately 5,000 yuan remaining from the pest control expenses, which can be allocated for borrowing, there are no other accumulated local public funds that can be allocated. Therefore, there is no way to proceed. If local gentry can all enthusiastically assist, gather more private shares, and work together to prepare, it will not be difficult to see its early success. We have already replied to Mr. Cai in a letter some time ago, expressing this intention, and scheduled a meeting at 1:00 p.m. on March 9th in this government to convene representatives from various relevant groups and enthusiastic gentry and merchants to discuss implementation measures. We have always admired your association's concern for your hometown and enthusiasm for rural affairs. We hope that you will do your best to assist in the preparation of the farmers' bank so that we can see its early success. We especially hope that your association will send representatives to participate in the meeting on March 9th. Sincerely, Yinxian County Government.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphes Ministry of Finance to Increase Tax on Imported Rice in Fujian and Guangdong Provinces</h3>
<p>Orders the Abolition of Tax Bureaus and Consolidation into Customs for Collection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the tax on imported rice re-exported from Fujian and Guangdong provinces be increased to maintain the price of domestic rice. The original text is recorded below: "To the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: On the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from the Grain and Miscellaneous Grain Association, stating that in recent years, the rural economy of our country has been bankrupt, and the vitality of society is declining day by day. The reason is that foreign goods are dumped, causing the price of domestic goods to be miserable, and the decline in rice prices is especially fatal to the difficulties of farmers and merchants. Recognizing this, the association submitted an appeal to the authorities through your association last summer to levy import taxes on foreign rice, and we are deeply grateful for the government's approval and implementation. However, since its implementation, the effect has not been great, and the price of rice is still low. Taking the rice-deficient areas such as Guangdong and Fujian provinces as examples, the reported import tax on foreign rice is only half of that in other provinces, which has led to foreign rice still being sold well in South China, while domestic goods are still stranded in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces. Reading the news, Japan's rice is oversupplied and plans to dump all the rice stored in Taiwan and Korea into our country. If this is true, what can we imagine for the future? If the import tax on foreign rice in Fujian and Guangdong provinces is not made the same as that in other provinces as soon as possible, the sales of rice in South China will inevitably be encroached upon by foreign rice, and the rice in each producing area will still be in a desperate situation. The association feels the danger and dares not remain silent. We have always admired your association's leadership of Shanghai merchants and concern for the people's suffering. We respectfully ask you to describe the advantages and disadvantages and present them to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, urging them to quickly increase the import tax on foreign rice in these two provinces. This would be a blessing for farmers and merchants, and also a blessing for the country, etc. The association has arrived. Since the implementation of import taxes on foreign rice, only Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces have been excluded. At that time, the intention may have been to avoid double counting because the Guangdong and Fujian provinces had already set up bureaus to collect taxes. Moreover, at that time, the tax in Fujian was intercepted due to the changes in Fujian, and there was actually no possibility of collection. As for the people's food in Guangxi Province, it can still be self-sufficient, and sometimes it can even help Guangdong Province slightly. Therefore, the exclusion of Guangxi Province was originally a related matter, and the situation was not necessary. Now that the changes in Fujian have been settled and the government orders have been unified, the foreign rice tax bureau set up in the province can be abolished and merged into the customs to collect import taxes in accordance with the regulations. As for the import of foreign rice in Guangdong Province, it is the largest in the country. According to average statistics over the past 20 years, it accounts for almost 65%. Therefore, if the tax in Guangdong Province is excluded, it will still be difficult to block the leakage of foreign rice, and there will be no way to allocate surpluses and deficits to relieve the rural areas, and the rescue of rural areas will ultimately be empty talk. If it is said that the establishment of a bureau to collect foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province is related to the provincial treasury and it is difficult to stop it temporarily, why not merge it into the customs for collection and have the customs return the current tax amount in Guangdong Province? The rice tax collected by the bureau set up in Guangdong Province is only half of the customs duty, and it is impossible to protect domestic rice and block foreign rice. The price of agricultural products has fallen to this point, and it is impossible not to make a decisive decision. We respectfully ask your department to review and approve our request, which would be in the public interest. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Over Ninety Labor Unions Issue a Joint Telegram Supporting Wang and Chiang's Genuine Telegram</h3>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, Party Headquarters at all levels, Provincial and Municipal Governments, and all People's Organizations:</p>
<p>We note with grave concern that China is beset by misfortunes and unending disasters. Surrounded by powerful neighbors from without, and with the flames of banditry flaring up anew from within, rebellious elements are taking advantage of this critical moment of survival to create chaos, engaging in petty tricks to disrupt peace and hinder unification. This has further driven the rural economy to the brink of bankruptcy, and caused business and industry to decline daily. Fortunately, the central authorities are shouldering heavy responsibilities, embracing a humble and receptive attitude, and diligently striving for good governance. The foundation of our endangered nation relies on their steadfastness.</p>
<p>Having read the joint telegram from Wang [Jingwei] and Chiang [Kai-shek], which reiterated the vital principles of saving the nation and ensuring its survival, namely, suppressing bandits as a means to address the symptoms, and focusing on production and construction as a plan to address the root cause, and which emphasized the importance of sincere unity to overcome national difficulties together, we were deeply moved and encouraged after repeated readings.</p>
<p>Following a resolution passed at a temporary representative meeting of all labor unions in the city today, we unanimously support the telegram. This telegram is specifically sent to you for your kind consideration.</p>
<p>From the First District Shipbuilding Union, Sauce Industry Union, First District Cosmetics Union, Fourth District Paper Manufacturing Union, Fifth District Paper Manufacturing Union, Eleventh District Cotton Spinning Union, Sixth District Water and Electricity Union, Second District Water and Electricity Union, [untranslated] Union, Dried Goods Union, Third District Rubber Union, New-Style Laundry Union, Leather Manufacturing Union, Running Shoe Upper Union, Towing Union, Sixth District Paint Manufacturing Union, Construction Union, Kerosene Packaging Union, Toothbrush Union, Fourth District Electrical Appliance Union, First District Rubber Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Ninth District Soap and Medicine Union, Fifth District Cotton Spinning Union, First District Paper Manufacturing Union, Piano Industry Union, First District Cleaning Union, Postal Service Union, Third District Rubber Union, Seventh District Carpentry Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Sixth District Public Bus Union, Military Uniform Union, Candle Industry Union, Second-Class Needle and Thread Union, Fourth District Water and Electricity Union, Fourth District Cigarette Union, Grain Measuring Union, Rice Cart Union, Civil Boat Union, Wine Brewing Union, Incense Union, Lunar New Year Pictures, Foundry Union, Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Crew Union, Pig Bristle Union, Steamer Carpentry Union, Third District Cotton Spinning Union, Sixth District Tea Processing Union, Fourth District Cleaning Union, and over ninety other labor unions.

<h3>Su Ning Gunboat Sailed to Wusong Yesterday for Sea and Gunnery Trials</h3>
<p>The fifth patrol gunboat Su Ning, built by the Ministry of the Navy for the Coastal Defense Command, was commissioned last month. However, because the internal engineering was not fully completed, the Jiangnan Shipyard continued to send workers to rush the construction. It was just completed the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 8:00, the new ship-building officer, Mr. Zeng Guosheng, boarded the ship with personnel from the shipyard to conduct sea trials in the Sanjia Water area outside Wusongkou. The results showed that the speed was exactly the same as the originally specified 11 nautical miles per hour. At the same time, the ship test-fired its five 7mm front and rear guns several times, and the machine guns on both sides also performed well. It sailed back to Gaochangmiao at around 4:00 p.m. The ship is scheduled to sail to Nanjing on its maiden voyage within the next few days. The ship has a displacement of 300 tons, is 140 feet long, 20 feet wide, has a draft of 6 feet, and a speed of 11 nautical miles per hour. The captain of the ship is Mr. Zheng Choufang.</p>

At 4:00 p.m., he went to the office to handle accumulated official duties.</p>
<h3>Circular Order Requiring Employees of the Two Railways to Learn National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy</h3>
<p>The Transportation Office of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways issued a circular to all employees of the railway yesterday, stating in brief:</p>
<p>According to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway report, the National Phonetic Alphabet telegraph instructor, Shen Haoting, of the Upper North Station stated that since the National Phonetic Alphabet telegraph instruction began on January 10 in the meeting room on the second floor, more than a month has passed. All students, except for more than 30 people, including station clerks, inspectors, station inspectors, station masters, and telegraph operators, have reported. Other students, such as section inspectors, clerks, train personnel, and station masters of Maigen Road stations, have not reported. This makes it difficult to handle and progress. However, the deadline is approaching quickly, and if the deadline expires without good results, they will inevitably bear considerable responsibility. Therefore, they dare not procrastinate and report first.</p>
<p>It has been found that since the National Phonetic Alphabet telegraph instruction has already begun, all employees who should learn it should follow the instructions in Letter No. 4475073 and practice together to achieve completion, service academics, so that when the National Phonetic Alphabet telegraphy is implemented in the future, there will be no risk of being at a loss. The instructor's statement that it is difficult to handle and progress is true. Please instruct all absent students to go to study immediately, so as not to be unable to complete the course due to lack of adequate results when the deadline expires.</p>
<p>The promotion of National Phonetic Alphabet telegraphy is imperative. All stations on the two railways, and trains on each section, as well as employees in each section and share of this office whose daily work is closely related to telegraphy, should take turns to report to the supervisors and instructors for study first. This has been instructed in a circular letter on January 13. According to the previous situation, in addition to instructing each telegraph inspector to instruct each National Phonetic Alphabet telegraph instructor to investigate the whereabouts of the absent personnel, and to contact the relevant supervisors at any time, and report, it is now necessary to issue another circular letter, so that everyone should abide by it. All personnel who have not yet reported should quickly report to the relevant supervisors and instructors for study separately and on time, in order to learn and apply it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Nine Japanese Warships Entered the Port Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese-language newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" reported on the 25th that Commander Imamura, on board the flagship Izumo, led the 26th and 27th Destroyer Squadrons and nine gunboats to inspect North China on the 12th. They arrived in Qingdao on the 15th, and visited Jinan with his staff on the 17th. He returned to Qingdao on the 19th, set sail south on the 20th, and returned to Shanghai on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Private Postal Agencies to Cease Operations</h3>
<p>Over Three Hundred Private Postal Agencies in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</p>
<p>Jointly Petition the Ministry of Communications to Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>In order to unify the postal service, the Ministry of Communications ordered the postal bureaus to order private postal agencies in various places to cease operations by the end of this year. According to Yu Ranggeng of Quansheng Private Postal Agency in this city, the letters received by private postal agencies in coastal trading ports are already sent to the post office for registration and redistribution, according to the order of the post office. As for various letters in the interior, they are still directly delivered by private postal agencies due to inconvenient transportation.</p>
<p>Regarding the post office's order to private postal agencies to cease operations by the end of this year, the agencies have jointly petitioned the authorities to consider the people's livelihood and maintain the status quo. After all, after the closure of the agencies, a large number of footmen who rely on delivering letters will immediately face unemployment. The locations of the private postal agencies, such as Xiamen, Wenzhou, Yantai in Fujian; Yushan, Changshan, Shengxian, Xinchang, Zhuji in Zhejiang; and Changshu, Danyang, Wuxi in Jiangsu, total no less than two or three hundred.</p>

<h3>The China Animal Protection Association is Established</h3>
<p>Five Hundred Notables from Party and Government Circles Attend</p>
<p>Directors Elected, Constitution Approved, Declaration Issued</p>
<p>The China Animal Protection Association held its inaugural meeting at Jueyuan, Hardoon Road, at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Over five hundred notables from Party and government circles attended. The constitution was adopted on the spot, and directors were elected, making it a grand event. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Notables in Attendance</h3>
<p>Those who attended included Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Jiang Huaisu, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Gongchuo, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhu Ziqiao (represented by Cha Liangzhao), Kong Xiangxi, Hu Bokang, Li Jingwei, Jin Jinan, Huang Zhuocheng, Zhao Puchu, Zhu Xiechen, Shi Yuan Ying, Dubei, Xingding, and over five hundred others. Representatives of the Party and government attended to provide guidance, including Mao Yun of the Municipal Party Headquarters and Yan Wenyi of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Meeting Proceedings</h3>
<p>After performing the customary rituals, the chairman first reported on the purpose of initiating the Animal Protection Association (the speech is recorded separately). Then Li Jingwei reported on the preparation process (omitted). Then Li Dachao, Jiang Huaisu, Mao Yun, and others delivered speeches in succession (recorded separately). Then the constitution was adopted and twenty-one directors were elected by ballot. The meeting was adjourned after a group photo.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Ye Gongchuo reported, "The China Animal Protection Association is holding its inaugural meeting today. I am very grateful to all the guests and representatives of various institutions and organizations for attending. I would also like to thank the association on behalf of the committee. Animal protection associations are common charitable organizations in countries around the world, and are not unique to China. We should treat all kinds of animals equally and not wantonly kill them. The reason why countries have organizations for animal protection is this idea. Now, the constitutions of advanced countries also have animal protection regulations. Our China has always lacked such an organization, so that various animals have lost their protection. Given the current situation in China, the work of this association will certainly not produce rapid results. It is obviously a permanent cause, and it can also be said to be a cause of changing customs. It may take thirty, fifty, or a hundred years, but we should have a very strong force to continue our work. Now we should consolidate the foundation first, and try to add more members to cultivate the sound foundation of this association."</p>
<h3>Li Dachao's Speech</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's representative, Li Dachao, said, "Today the China Animal Protection Association is holding its inaugural meeting, and I am here to participate on behalf of Mayor Wu. Because I did not prepare a speech, I will simply say a few words. In the past, we Chinese had so-called 'freeing of life,' but this kind of freeing of life was passive and had no strength. Today's China Animal Association is an organized and powerful organization, and it cannot be compared with the so-called 'freeing of life' in the past. Today, our responsibility for attending this meeting should be to practice what we advocate. We should also persuade those who have not participated to come and participate, so that this kind of compassionate work will slowly spread from Shanghai to the whole of China."</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Instructions</h3>
<p>(1) Jiang Huaisu, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Executive Committee, said briefly, "The starting point of the Animal Protection Association lies in 'benevolence.' The meaning of our revolution is also the word 'benevolence.' My interest in participating in this association also lies in this. However, the scope of animal protection is too broad. The Municipal Party Headquarters has had a very detailed discussion on this issue. The result is that we should protect what is beneficial to us, and conversely, what is harmful to us, such as violent beasts and rice-eating pests, should be captured and killed by everyone. I hope that this association will also follow this principle, weighing the importance of each."</p>
<p>(2) Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said briefly, "China has an Animal Protection Association only today. The ancients said that the way to love life is inherent in everyone. Human beings and creatures are originally only different in shape, but life is the same. Therefore, an animal protection organization is very necessary."</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Cables Shandong and Henan Provinces to Strictly Prohibit the Slaughter of Lambs</h3>
<p>Protecting Animal Husbandry to Avoid Extinction of Sheep Breeds</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a cable to the provincial governments of Shandong and Henan yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>(Beginning of Salutation, omitted)</p>
<p>On the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from the local Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Raw Leather Industry Association, stating that the leather merchant He Shunqing said in a letter, "Shunqing has been engaged in the cattle and sheep leather industry for many years. When examining its production areas, the most abundant areas are Jinning, Xuzhou, Guide, Zhoukou, and other places in the Yellow River basin. Each year, these ports produce about five to six thousand dan, and now during this recent period production has decreased by one-third. The reason is due to banditry and flooding, which have appeared in layers. However, the most serious problem is the general rural ignorance and their slaughter of fetal lambs for immediate gain. If this is not stopped, the custom will become commonplace, and the number of goats will decrease daily. In one or two years, there will be a fear of extinction of sheep breeds." Shunqing, for the sake of the leather industry, specifically requested the association to forward a request to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and to forward a letter to the chambers of commerce in the respective ports to strictly prohibit the slaughter of fetal lambs.</p>
<p>According to this, the law does not allow the slaughter of fetal lambs. This not only endangers the leather industry, but also greatly hurts the heaven's virtue of loving life. Now the rural people in each port are only seeking immediate benefits and disregarding long-term harm, which is not appropriate. According to the previous situation, we should send a letter to your office, requesting you to forward it to the chambers of commerce in each port, and instruct the leather industry associations to strictly prohibit the slaughter of fetal lambs, so that the rural people in each port will be vigilant.</p>
<p>It has been received by the association. In light of this, if the slaughter of fetal lambs is allowed to continue, the sheep breeds will soon become extinct. Not only will the leather industry have no business to operate, but also the rural sideline products will be reduced, and the slaughter tax collected by the government will also be indirectly affected. The reasons for this matter are complex, and the root cause is the collapse of the countryside. The rural farmers have to take this temporary measure for the sake of the present. It is by no means possible for the chambers of commerce in each area to strictly stop this behavior.</p>
<p>We propose that your government issue an order to the county governments in each county, and to cooperate with local people, to jointly plan methods to alleviate the countryside and maintain animal husbandry, so that actions can be taken on what has been said, not just a single bulletin. May the raising and breeding of livestock flourish, and may farmers and merchants both benefit.</p>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Respectfully,</p>
<h3>Banning the Slaughter of Plow Cattle</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry, Finance, and Interior Establish a Plow Cattle Inspection Office</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has already issued a circular to all provinces and cities prohibiting the private slaughter of plow cattle. Now, according to reports from various provinces and cities, there are still cases of slaughter and transportation in various places. At this time of spring plowing, protection should be given. Therefore, it is planned to organize a plow cattle inspection office and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is heard that the ministry has already received an order from the Yuan, and on the day before yesterday (the 24th), representatives from the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Interior held a joint meeting and decided to not only issue a joint circular to various places prohibiting slaughter and transportation, but also decided to organize a plow cattle inspection office. In the future, the inspection procedures will be determined by specialized veterinarians. If it is determined that the cattle are old, weak, or sick, they will be allowed to be slaughtered. All other cattle are strictly prohibited from being slaughtered.</p>
<h3>A Hero Reaches the End of His Road Due to Difficult Living</h3>
<p>Liang Tongfang Repeatedly Fought Against Japan</p>
<p>Suffered from Hard Living and Attempted Suicide in a Hotel</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang, who served as a volunteer soldier during the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident] and later joined the Northeast Anti-Japanese forces, is from Shangyu, Zhejiang Province, and is currently 25 years old. After the failure of the Northeast Anti-Japanese forces, he traveled to Shanghai, but because of the difficult living conditions, he relied on pulling a rickshaw to make a living. However, everything is expensive in Shanghai, and his livelihood became even more difficult. Unexpectedly, Liang suddenly became disillusioned with the world. At about 8:00 p.m. the night before last, he brought a bedding roll and a net basket and took a rickshaw to the Old Oriental Hotel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road to stay. He claimed to be Wu Chengfang, a native of Zhejiang, 24 years old. The hotel clerk led him to room 113. After Liang settled his luggage, he went out again. Shortly afterwards, he returned and closed the door to go to bed at around 9:50. Until 2:00 p.m. yesterday, he had not gotten up. The waiter on the floor became suspicious and knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time. He quickly devised a way to open the door and enter the room, where he saw Liang unconscious in bed, his face pale, and his speech blurred. The waiter reported to the clerk, who reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station. A detective was dispatched to rush Liang to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital doctor administered emergency treatment and induced him to vomit the poison. It was learned that he had swallowed opium. After his consciousness was slightly clear, the police repeatedly interrogated him and he finally revealed his real name as Liang Tongfang. Wu Chengfang was an alias. By 10:00 p.m., he was completely out of danger. At the same time, Liang himself requested to be discharged from the hospital. The hospital notified the police, who sent a detective to pick him up for further action.</p>
<h3>Morphine Mixed into Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Deeply Poisonous and Extremely Harmful</p>
<p>Lu Zuode has been Apprehended and Handed Over to the Law</p>
<p>According to a tip-off received by the Independent Squadron of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Lu Zuode, a Ningbo native, at No. 186 Qinglian Street, specializes in selling morphine and mixing morphine into cigarettes and selling them to opium addicts. The practice is known as "opening a cannon," which can avoid public attention, is convenient to carry, and has a good business. He was reported by jealous competitors. After receiving the report, the squadron took the informant and arrested Lu Zuode, seized more than ten taels of morphine, and took him to the team to await legal action.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of a Honey Trap</h3>
<p>Chen Fuliang Originally Sentenced to Two Months in Prison</p>
<p>Sentence Increased to One Year Imprisonment After Appeal</p>
<p>Previously, Lin Yaoxuan, a Sichuan native, residing in room 37 of Yiji Sichuan Warehouse, No. 1 Huicheng Lane, Madian Road, French Concession, 28 years old, frequently traveled between Sichuan and Shanghai, dealing in white fungus, pickles, and foreign goods. He was quite wealthy. He lived in Shanghai for many days and often felt lonely. He occasionally visited prostitutes. Hu Ruiting, a foreign goods broker from Zhenjiang who knew him, introduced Ms. Wu, the wife of Shen Shoukang, the owner of the Jiankang Hospital at No. 25 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, to Lin as a mistress. They often used hotels as a place for secret trysts. At about 2:00 p.m. on September 29 of last year, Hu ordered Ms. Wu to go to room 532 of the Central Hotel in the Public Concession first, and invited Lin to continue their rendezvous. Shen Shoukang, Ms. Wu's husband, found out about it and discussed it with his friend Chen Fuliang. Chen then led Shen and his companion Li Hong to the Central Hotel, broke into the room, and accused Lin of adultery in order to extort money (commonly known as a "honey trap"). First, they slapped and beat Lin, and then Chen and others took Lin to the law office of Zhang Wei at No. 105 Xuehuali Road, French Concession, and confined him. They threatened him in every way, forcing him to issue two promissory notes for 500 yuan each, totaling 1,000 yuan, with a deadline of October 1 for payment to settle the matter. They also took away 15 yuan in cash and a watch from Lin's person before releasing Lin and restoring his freedom.</p>
<p>Later, Lin was unwilling to accept this and reported to the French police station, accusing Chen and others of kidnapping and extortion and requesting prosecution. The police chief approved the report and sent detectives to arrest Chen, Shen, Li, Hu, and Ms. Wu and to search Chen's house and retrieve the promissory notes, cash, and watch. They were sent to the Second Special District Local Court for prosecution. After trial, Shen Shoukang and Chen Fuliang were each sentenced to two months in prison and fined 200 yuan each. Li Hong was sentenced to two months in prison, and Hu Ruiting was fined 300 yuan. Shen Wu was acquitted. Shen Shoukang was granted a two-year suspended sentence. During the appeal period, they were all allowed bail. Later, Li and Hu expressed their willingness to accept the sentence, and the sentence has already been executed after being confirmed. However, Chen Fuliang alone expressed his disagreement with the original sentence and hired a lawyer to appeal to the Jiangsu Higher Third Branch Court.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned situation has been reported in the previous newspaper. After repeated hearings by the High Court, the final verdict was announced in the Third Criminal Court by Judge Guo, accompanied by Assessors Fan and Sun, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao, the day before yesterday afternoon. Chen was summoned to court. The judge read out the main text of the judgment, the original judgment was revoked, and Chen Fuliang was sentenced to one year in prison for joint intimidation and extortion. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined will be offset at two days per one day of imprisonment. After the judgment, the judge explained the meaning of the judgment to Chen, saying that the court's trial result showed that your criminal acts were organized and planned, and the original trial's sentencing was inappropriate, so the sentence was changed to one year in prison. If you disagree, you can appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days of receiving the judgment. You failed to appear the last two times you were summoned, and the bailor also failed to appear in court. This court believes that you have a risk of escape and must be taken into custody today. When Chen heard the order to be taken into custody, his face changed and he asked to remain on the original bail or to find another suitable bailor. The court did not allow it, and the police took him to the detention center for custody.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Sues Zhang Zhiliang for Abandonment After Love Affair</h3>
<p>Zhang Denies Cohabitation</p>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for March 1</p>
<p>Han Xiaomao, a Suzhou native and prostitute from Changsan Brothel [high-class brothel], also known as Yan'e Lao Ba, 22 years old, is currently at Qunyufang, and seeks cases under the name "Li Qing". Through her lawyer, Han lodged a complaint in the criminal court of the Second Special District Local Court accusing Zhang Zhiliang, a native of Chuansha, 31 years old, who resides at No. 1 Xingshun North Lane, Remi Road, French Concession, and runs a construction factory (the factory's name is unknown), of seducing and abandoning her, a violation of Article 310 of the criminal law.</p>
<p>The complaint stated that in the spring of 1913, when she was 18 years old, she met Zhang Zhiliang. Because she was young and inexperienced and her will was weak, she was seduced by Zhang into committing adultery. Because she was six months pregnant, she married Zhang as a concubine. She lived with Zhang in his house in Chuansha, Pudong. After three months, she gave birth to a daughter. At first, they were on good terms, but unexpectedly, over time, Zhang became tired of her and treated her with violence. The following year, when she returned to Ningbo to visit relatives, Zhang refused to cohabitate with her. She had no choice but to return to Shanghai and live with her mother. Since then, Zhang has not provided any living expenses. The defendant has abandoned her, violating the criminal law, and should be investigated. In addition, she filed a civil suit to recover the debts incurred by the plaintiff and her daughter for living expenses during the period of abandonment, as well as the living expenses for the next 39 years of the plaintiff's life until the age of 60 and the daughter's education expenses, totaling 87,860 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiff, Han Xiaomao, and her lawyer to the Second Criminal Court the day before yesterday by Presiding Judge Wu Fanglian. Han Xiaomao testified that she was seduced by Zhang in the first month of her eighteenth year. In August of that year, she married Zhang as a concubine and lived with him in Yile Lane, Danshui Road. In November, she gave birth to a daughter. In February of the following year, Zhang and his second concubine took her to Zhang's house in the countryside, where they lived for two months. After returning to Shanghai, she was abandoned and ignored.</p>
<p>The defendant, Zhang Zhiliang, and his defense lawyers, Wang Shizong and Zhu Taiqing, arrived in court. Zhang stated in his defence that the plaintiff was known as Yan'e Lao Ba in the brothel in the winter of 1912, and he and his friends met her during a call. In the spring of 1913, the plaintiff opened her own brothel, renamed herself Zhuo Wenjun, and due to pregnancy at Mid-Autumn Festival she stopped her visits, and lived in Yile Lane. He often went to her home to see her. After she gave birth, in the spring of 1914, she worked as a prostitute in Sanyuanfang, renamed herself Wen Di, and then sought cases at Fuxiang Lane, changing her name to Hua Bifang. Recently she was known under the name Li Qing in Qunyufang. He never married her as a concubine, nor did they cohabitate. Her daughter was not his. Completely false accusation and requested to be acquitted, and requested permission to countersue the plaintiff for slander. He named his friends Zhu Xiaofeng (manager of the real estate department of Wuhe Foreign Company) and Zhu's concubine Cui Meimei, as well as his own second concubine Yao Jinying, as witnesses.</p>
<p>The three witnesses gave their statements, Zhu said that he had gone to the plaintiff's place with Zhang Zhiliang for social entertainment, but did not know that Zhang had married the plaintiff as a concubine. Cui's testimony was the same as her husband's. Yao Jinying stated that Zhang Zhiliang was her husband, and she lived at No. 1, Lane 107, Songshan Road. She did not know the plaintiff and had seen her once. According to her husband, she was the wife of a friend. After the lawyers on both sides debated, the court adjourned the debate and scheduled the verdict for 9:00 a.m. on March 1.</p>
<h3>Astonishing Freight Revenue Earned by Various Countries in China</h3>
<p>Totaling 2,149,880,983 Taels</p>
<p>With Britain in the Lead, Followed by Japan, the United States, France, Russia, and Others</p>
<p>In recent years, foreign ships operating within China have expanded from coastal areas to inland rivers. Navigation on the Yangtze River, for instance, is largely controlled by British and Japanese shipping merchants. Unless immediate measures are taken to negotiate and reclaim these rights, it will be difficult to develop our own national shipping industry. A reporter from the New News Agency conducted a special investigation into the freight revenue earned by various countries in China. The statistics are as follows: Britain earned 1,162,926,181 taels, Norway 10,836,492 taels, Japan 707,210,534 taels, Denmark 9,455,328 taels, the United States 145,704,129 taels, Sweden 3,830,734 taels, France 45,610,894 taels, Russia 41,905,945 taels, Italy 3,497,459 taels, Portugal 1,588,971 taels, the Netherlands 16,999,362 taels, and others 316,954 taels, totaling 2,149,880,983 taels.

<h3>Intense Courtroom Debate Over the Auction of Huang Chu-jiu's Real Estate</h3>
<p>Judge Cao Advocated Transferring the Property to Mortgagees at an Assessed Price</p>
<p>Attorney Yan Firmly Opposed, Requesting Auction by an Auction House</p>
<p>丨The Debate Remained Inconclusive, Rescheduled for Further Hearing丨</p>
<p>Following the death of Huang Chu-jiu and the subsequent collapse of Gongfa Company, Daye Bank, and the Great World Entertainment Deposit Department, the litigation over his debts and estate has not been fully resolved. The Second Special District Court held another execution hearing the other day regarding the auction of Huang's real estate, summoning both creditors and debtors to express their opinions. The courtroom proceedings are recorded as follows: After the court was called to order, the attorneys representing both the creditors and debtors were summoned to the court. Judge Cao Jun announced that the court had repeatedly auctioned Huang Chu-jiu's real estate at reduced prices. Only one property in Rongqing Lane and one leased land on Avenue Foch had been purchased. The rest remained unsold. The court now intends to transfer the real estate to the mortgagees at an assessed price. Attorney Yan Luqing, representing the creditors, immediately stood up to object, stating that his clients had submitted a petition to the court, and he was unsure if it had been received. He then read the entire draft of the petition verbatim. The petition stated:</p>
<p>(The petition reports unfounded rumors. The petitioners are impoverished and helpless creditors of Daye Bank. Since the death of Huang Chu-jiu and the subsequent collapse of Daye Bank, three years have passed. Only 20% of the debt has been repaid by the former French Concession court. Since the case was taken over by this court, two years have passed, and not a single penny has been repaid. With regard to the sale of Huang Chu-jiu's real estate, the petitioners have submitted dozens of requests to designate an auction house for the auction. However, this court has disregarded the petitioners' wishes and conducted the auction itself. The result is exactly what the petitioners predicted: a waste of time and advertising expenses. Moreover, the delay has led to rent reduction issues, greatly diminishing the value of the real estate. Recently, we have heard the following unfounded rumors, which have left the petitioners distraught: "Regarding the Huang Chu-jiu case, the judge of the execution court of the Second Special District Court is a living Bodhisattva, no different from a puppet. It is said that Wanchun Banking Group (whose mortgage contract, though bearing the names of prominent figures in Shanghai, is suspected of being forged and is well-known to the court) and the China Industrial Bank (whose mortgage contract for banknotes has long expired) have reached an agreement with the president of the court to utilize the regulation that appeals do not suspend execution of the case, allowing them to receive the existing funds in the court." Upon hearing this, the petitioners were dubious and rushed to their attorney, Yan Luqing, inquiring whether the rumors were reliable and requesting the court to conduct a thorough investigation. Attorney Yan stated, "These rumors are unreliable and damage the reputation of the court. It is regrettable that the creditors did not send the rumor-mongers to the Public Security Bureau for strict punishment according to law. As for Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank wanting to receive funds, the execution court will definitely not allow it. Please rest assured. Although Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank have requested payment, since the creditors have expressed their opposition, the court will order Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank to file a lawsuit for confirmation and will not rashly approve their payment. This is the legal point of view. In fact, the president of the court is as intelligent and wise as this attorney. If I were in his position, I would not allow the payment either. If the Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank are recklessly allowed to receive the money and leave, it will not benefit the court and will impose a significant responsibility. Who would be willing to do this? Even a madman would not be willing to do it. Would a president of the court who is intelligent and upright be willing to do this? It is self-evident. Moreover, even if all of Huang Chu-jiu's real estate is sold, the proceeds would not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank. The ordinary creditors of Daye Bank would not receive a single penny. Therefore, the court will definitely not recklessly approve the payment. As for the creditors' request for the court to thoroughly investigate this rumor, it is meaningless. Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank have not contacted the president of the court to receive payment. Furthermore, the court will definitely not allow Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank to receive payment. Therefore, these unfounded rumors will disappear without investigation." Upon hearing this, the petitioners thanked him and retreated. We now submit this petition, earnestly requesting the execution court of this court to reject the payment requests of Wanchun Banking Group and China Industrial Bank. The petitioners would rather lose in the civil court. This is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the execution court of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai.)</p>
<p>After Attorney Yan finished reading the petition, the entire courtroom was silent. Judge Cao took the petition to read it and then stated that the petition mainly contained two points. The first point was the request for auction by an auction house, and the second point was the opposition to the mortgage claims of China Industrial Bank and Wanchun Banking Group. Regarding the auction issue, it could be discussed. Attorney Shan Yuhua, representing the mortgagee China Industrial Bank, stated that the China Industrial Bank was willing to receive the real estate at an assessed price, as instructed by the court. Attorney Peng Qi, representing the mortgagee Wanchun Banking Group, stated that Wanchun Banking Group was unwilling to receive it. Attorney Yan stated that China Industrial Bank and Wanchun Banking Group were not qualified to express their opinions before their claims were confirmed. Attorney Shan then debated with Attorney Yan. Attorney Yan reiterated that the court had previously conducted the auction of Huang Chu-jiu's real estate itself, but no one had purchased it, as the creditors had predicted. This was due to two reasons: First, the auction procedures of the judicial authorities were cumbersome. Second, it was due to the prevailing superstition in our country that purchasing property from the judicial authorities was unlucky. To ensure the early sale of Huang Chu-jiu's real estate and obtain a higher price, it was necessary to designate an auction house for the auction. Moreover, the method of designating an auction house for the auction had been requested by the majority of creditors. Previously, the court had granted the request of a minority of creditors and conducted the auction itself, resulting in a waste of time and advertising expenses. Therefore, today, the court should grant the request of the majority of creditors and designate an auction house for the auction. Furthermore, this case was a special case in Shanghai and should be handled specially. Attorney Zhu Shuzhen then stated that Attorney Yan's proposal to have the auction house conduct the auction was not unreasonable. Previously, Huang Chu-jiu's movable property had also been auctioned by an auction house designated by the court. Therefore, it would not be inappropriate for the court to hand over the real estate to the auction house for auction and see how it goes. Attorney Shan stated that the case had already been auctioned at a reduced price, and it was inconvenient for the court to come forward for the auction again. The liquidators Wu Zheng, Pan Zhaobang, and the accountant could join Attorney Tan Yigong to publish an auction advertisement. Attorney Tan stated that Attorney Shan was unaware of the complexity of the case, and it was inconvenient for him to come forward. Accountant Pan stated that the case had already been auctioned at a reduced price, and no one had purchased it. It would be better to transfer the property to the mortgagees at an assessed price, as instructed by the court. Attorney Yan stood up angrily and loudly requested the clerk to record that anyone requesting to transfer the property to the mortgagees at an assessed price should be recorded in the minutes. If the property was transferred to the mortgagees at an assessed price, the ordinary creditors would not receive a single penny. Therefore, the creditors would have to settle accounts with those requesting to transfer the property to the mortgagees at an assessed price. Attorney Yu Zhongluo stood up and stated that Attorney Yan's angry and aggressive presentation was inappropriate. Attorney Yan stood up and stated that he was fighting vigorously with anger because he saw that his clients' rights were in danger. Even if it violated etiquette, he did not care. Accountant Pan then declared to the court that he was withdrawing the above proposal and requested the clerk to record the withdrawal request in the minutes. At this point, Judge Cao adjourned the court and announced that a further hearing would be scheduled. The intense debate was finally calmed.</p>
<h3>Police Chief of the First Sub-Bureau of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Liu Lun, Accused</h3>
<p>Director Wen Ordered an Investigation and Dismissed Liu Upon Confirmation</p>
<p>Liu Has Fled in Fear of Punishment, and the Court Has Repeatedly Summoned Him Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>Merchants and residents in the Xinjingzhen area of northwestern Shanghai jointly reported to the District Court that Liu Lun, the police chief stationed at the First Sub-Bureau of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was colluding with local thugs, neglecting his duties, and harming the people. Their statement stated that since the police chief took office, he had misused his power for personal gain, dismissing experienced police officers. Within a year, his means of extortion had become extremely sophisticated. He colluded with local thugs, oppressing the villagers together. The officials and thugs protected each other, and their illegal activities were too numerous to count, such as sheltering opium dens and gambling dens, collecting illegal fees, arbitrarily handling civil and criminal cases, abusing his power, and perverting the law. All fines were not issued with receipts. The local people, suffering from his abuse, dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Under this banner of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, all corrupt officials, evil gentry, and evil forces have been eliminated. However, Police Chief Liu Lun, under the pretext of his official authority, arbitrarily handled debt disputes and arrested the debtors, threatening and detaining them in every possible way. Furthermore, a villager named Zhang Jingsheng was extorted for opium use, and a bribe of 200 yuan was paid by the thug Cheng Dexiu to settle the matter, without issuing a receipt. In addition, the villager Zhu Guotao was detained and fined 104 yuan for marrying without reporting to the police, and no receipt was issued either. All the above facts show that he colluded with the thug Cheng Dexiu to engage in bribery. His abuse of power and harm to the people were too numerous to mention. None of the civil and criminal cases were transferred to the competent court for handling. Their oppressive situation was not only witnessed and angered by the complainants but also should be hated by outsiders for their illegal behavior. Moreover, police officers are responsible for supervising the police and maintaining law and order. However, the police chief not only failed to maintain law and order but also endangered it, neglecting his duties and harming the people. His evil deeds were so egregious that he was guilty of heinous crimes. Therefore, we jointly implore this court to punish him according to law and have mercy on the suffering of the people. (Since the case occurred, Director Wen Hong'en of the Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered an investigation and immediately dismissed Police Chief Liu Lun upon confirmation, and transferred Inspector Hong Zhen (Minqing) of the bureau to succeed him. Chief Hong has already taken office.) According to the complaint, the court had previously ordered Prosecutor Wu Deying to summon the complainants and witnesses for investigation. The other day, the court again ordered Yao Xing, Lu Shiqing, Yang Jinshan, Yang Adi, Yao Youliang, Fan Yousheng, Wang Quansheng, Yin Shaofan, Jin Yucheng, Xu Yongqing, and other complainants to be summoned for questioning. It is reported that Liu Lun and Cheng Dexiu have fled without a trace since the case occurred. Because the court has repeatedly summoned them unsuccessfully, it is unknown how to conclude the case.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company Believes the Time is Premature to Extend Bus Service to Wusong</h3>
<p>The Company Replied to the Public Utilities Bureau by Letter</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company received orders to extend the Shanghai-Wusong line, it has now learned that the company has submitted a report. The original text is as follows: Regarding the matter of submitting a reply, the instruction No. 2605 issued by your bureau on February 12th stated that the Seventh District Party Headquarters requested to instruct the company to extend Route 4 to Wusong, etc. Upon receiving this, we were about to reply when we received instruction No. 2608 from your bureau on February 15th, stating that according to the instruction of the Municipal Government and the approval of the Municipal Executive Committee, the matter of extending the public bus service to Wusong should be reported together for review. Upon receiving this, the company complied with the order and sent personnel to conduct a route survey and investigate the residents along the way to facilitate implementation. It was found that the length of the line from the New Municipal Government to the Aquatic School at Paotaiwan was 18 kilometers, and the road surface was all cinder, which was still rugged and uneven. In Yinhang Town, there were approximately 5,000 residents, and most of them were farmers engaged in agriculture. Furthermore, according to a certain gentleman from the Municipal Affairs Branch Committee of the town, there was already a taxi service station in the town, with two vehicles capable of accommodating a dozen people. However, there were very few passengers traveling from the city center to Shanghai. In Wusong Town, Paotaiwan, Zhanghuabang, and other places, more passengers took the small train than the municipal ferry. The municipal ferry departs once every hour, while the small train departs 19 times a day, and each train uses double engines. However, passengers tend to prefer the small train, and the number of passengers still seems uneconomical. The company sent personnel to investigate twice, and the reports were all consistent. Furthermore, the transportation from Wusong Town to the city center can be done by taking the small train to Jiangwan or Tiantong'an Station, and then transferring to the company's public bus, costing only 35 cents, which can be reached in less than an hour. The time and fares are both economical. It is also reported that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is preparing to increase the number of trains in March, and at the same time, cancel seat classes and reduce fares. The municipal government has also approved the Ministry of Railways to extend the Shanghai-Wusong line to Sanmin Road, which has been reported in the newspapers and has already been implemented. The company repeatedly considered that if Route 4 were to be extended to Paotaiwan, it would inevitably require adding more vehicles to operate, which would be convenient. In addition, the road surface is uneven, and the machinery is prone to damage, which would further create competition between the company and the railway. If there are not enough passengers, both sides will suffer losses. Moreover, the railway is state-owned and has unlimited financial resources.

<h3>Dispute Over Restrictions on Rickshaw Licenses by the French Authorities</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession Municipal Council implemented restrictions on rickshaw licenses in 1934, some rickshaw dealers did not receive the news in advance, resulting in all the licenses being pre-emptively obtained by major rickshaw dealers in the Nantao area. Some small rickshaw dealers who had only one or two rickshaws were unable to obtain licenses. There were more than 300 rickshaws affected. Since this incident occurred, more than three months have passed. Representatives of the rickshaw dealers have repeatedly been running around appealing and asking the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession to intercede with the French authorities on their behalf. The French Municipal Council replied that the original number of licenses was 17,000, and there were still 36 licenses remaining. The reason for the restriction was that the Board of Directors had approved the implementation and followed the example of the Public Concession in order to maintain traffic. The rickshaw dealers learned that 36 licenses were not enough to be distributed, so they unanimously refused to accept them. On the one hand, members of various rickshaw guilds conducted investigations and found that the association's report for January included 813 new members. However, the guild did not maintain the livelihood of old members and gave priority to new members in obtaining licenses, which was disregarding the suffering of fellow members. Therefore, hundreds of rickshaw pullers who have been unemployed for days have gathered in the guild in Sanminfang, Nantao, demanding that the guild find ways to provide relief. Upon learning of this, the committee members, fearing something unfavorable would happen, all avoided attending meetings and handling affairs, allowing the unemployed people to argue with each other. However, in order to seek relief for themselves, the rickshaw dealers convened a meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures and elected Li Bingyi, Liu Qikuan, and Lu Xiushan as general representatives to handle all negotiation procedures. It was decided to question the guild for its poor handling of affairs with ten reasons, demanding a response within 48 hours; otherwise, a petition would be submitted to a higher authority. Regarding the method of requesting the French authorities to issue licenses, it was decided to: (1) Request the French authorities to re-register all rickshaws in order to identify those who obtained licenses by false pretenses. (2) Investigate and verify those who obtained licenses by false pretenses and file lawsuits against rickshaw dealers for compensation for losses incurred over the past three months according to law. (3) If the French authorities cannot relax the restrictions on rickshaw licenses, please extract one license out of every twenty licenses from major rickshaw dealers, based on a value of five percent. (4) Periodically go to the French Municipal Council and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession to continue petitioning for relief for the livelihood of small rickshaw dealers and the poor. (5) Issue a declaration requesting assistance from all sectors of society. (6) Hire Attorney Wu Kaisheng as the representative of the unemployed rickshaw pullers to legally protect their rights. (7) Demand that all members of the guild provide mutual assistance to unemployed fellow members; otherwise, payments should be suspended, as the guild employs staff with huge salaries but does not handle affairs for members. (8) Before the dispute over rickshaw licenses is resolved, all rickshaw dealers should suspend the acceptance of March rickshaw licenses and wait for a fair decision from the French authorities. All the above measures were unanimously approved and adopted, and it was decided to gather at the guild hall in Sanminfang at 3 PM every day to discuss all the implementation measures. Therefore, the rickshaw license dispute may not be resolved for a while.</p>
<h3>The Copper Coin Price Plummets and the Tobacco Retail Industry Will Reorganize Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Branch of the Tobacco Retail Industry Guild previously announced a list of revised prices due to the meager profits of the industry and the recent surge in the price of foreign coins. Selling at the previously set prices would result in losses. Unexpectedly, since yesterday, the price of foreign coins has increased to more than 3,190 cash, and selling at the listed prices would still result in losses. Yesterday, members such as Zhen He Xiang and Yishengchang reported to the branch, requesting continued reorganization and re-evaluation of prices. In addition, several tobacco companies and Xiang Mao Soap, managed by the China Soap Company, have different amounts of funding and unequal treatment. They request convening a meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to resolve the remedial measures, correct business malpractices, protect the industry, and maintain the development of the guild so that the industry can live in peace. The branch will report the situation to the chairman of the guild and immediately convene a meeting, sending letters to all the committee members, urging them to attend on time to discuss unified prices, jointly design improvements to the guild's operations, and plan for the welfare of the industry.</p>

<h3>Kunshan Stationmaster Gu Kecheng Injured in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>Colleagues at Nanxiang Station Telegraph to Request Negotiation</p>
<p>A fast mail telegram from the colleagues at Nanxiang Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Transport Office states: To the Ministry of Railways, all Party Headquarters, all agencies, all newspapers, and all railway stations across the country. On the 24th of this month, Gu Kecheng, the stationmaster of Kunshan Station, was violently beaten and stabbed by Nie Jingyu, the deputy captain of the First Team of the Air Reconnaissance Brigade, resulting in injuries all over his body. The order at the station was disrupted for a time, and transport operations almost came to a standstill. If such an illegal military officer is not severely punished, it will be unimaginable how difficult dispatching and train operations will be in the future. On that day, the No. 328 freight train was attached with several troop cars from the Air Reconnaissance Brigade. When the train arrived at Kunshan, the engine was watered as usual. Due to the handover of the cars, there was a slight delay at the station. Unexpectedly, Deputy Captain Nie Jingyu got off the train without clarifying the situation and stabbed Stationmaster Gu Kecheng, seriously injuring him. Not satisfied, he gathered a crowd to beat him. Fortunately, the station's stationed military police persuaded him to stop. The stationmaster's position is more responsible than any other railway worker, but the treatment is harsh. The railway has always been like this, but with the railway operation as a prerequisite, everyone endures hardship and works diligently. Now, for the sake of the public, he has suffered such unnecessary great pain and great insult. We colleagues find it difficult to swallow. Fortunately, the entire railway has united to fight to the end, and we are submitting to the superiors, strictly requesting negotiation to severely punish Nie Jingyu in order to redress public anger and benefit railway affairs. On the one hand, we are submitting to the newly appointed Director Xiao to grant appropriate guarantees to appease the people. The telegram is urgent and awaiting orders. Respectfully, the colleagues at Nanxiang Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Transport Office.</p>

<h3>Five Apprentices from China Electric Wire Factory Missing</h3>
<p>He Hongcheng, He Hongzao, Cai Bende, Wu Jiading, Chen Yanhui were employed as apprentices at the China Electric Wire Factory at 55 Dalian Bay Road, Shanghai Public Concession, which employs many workers and apprentices. Among them, apprentices He Hongcheng, 16 years old; He Hongzao, 19 years old; Cai Bende, 21 years old; Wu Jiading, 22 years old; and Chen Yanhui, 19 years old, were very close. During breaks, they often went out together. People in the factory were not suspicious because the apprentices often went out. Unexpectedly, on the 16th of this month, the five of them went out together under the pretext of sightseeing and never returned. Afterwards, the factory manager checked the apprentices' belongings and found that they had not taken anything with them. Therefore, he was extremely anxious and sent people to search everywhere, but to no avail. The families are all trying to find them. However, He Hongcheng's mother has been crying all day since her beloved son disappeared and has become blind. The factory has reported the disappearance of the five apprentices to the local police station, requesting them to investigate their whereabouts. Meanwhile, He Hongcheng's father, He Jizhi, is having leaflets printed with the faces of the five apprentices and the clothes they were wearing when they left, and distributing them to the public, asking for attention. If anyone knows the whereabouts of the apprentices, please contact 55 Dalian Bay Road or call 51395 to reunite the families.</p>
<h3>Sleepy Driver Crashes into Iron Pillar</h3>
<p>Yu Changfu from Yangzhou, 24 years old, is a driver at the Tefei Motor Company on Minquan Road.

<h3>Robbers Gorge Themselves in Restaurant, Planning to Rob Property after Eating</h3>
<p>Police Receive Tip and Make Arrests</p>
<p>More Robbers Captured</p>
<p>Chinese Detective Wang Chengying and Detective Yang Xiguang of the Jiaxing Road Police Station received information at 5:15 PM the day before yesterday that there were robbers in the Dexinglou Restaurant at 1719 Tangen Road, eating heartily, planning to rob nearby residents after their meal. They reported to the police chief and, along with Western detectives, secretly went to the address and arrested Cao Zhenxi, Xu Debiao, and Du Baoliang from Funing. A Hezhong brand pistol, number 765, with eight bullets, was found in Cao's short shirt pocket. They confessed that the firearms were given to them by Li Chunsheng from Yancheng, who was hiding at 3524 Yinghua Lane, Robert Road, and instructed them to take them to a certain place in northern Shanghai. The detectives went to the address and arrested Li. Upon questioning, they learned that there were also accomplices, Ma Laosi and Tang Youjiu from Shandong, at 18 Jiantou, Shihuigang, Xieqiao Road, in the jurisdiction of the Third District of Nanshi. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the scene and, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, arrested Ma and Tang without making a sound and took them to the bureau for temporary detention. Cao Zhenxi and the other three were taken to the police station for detention. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department explained the situation, stating that the restaurant on Tangen Road was connected to the jurisdiction of the Fifth District, and that the defendants had first been taken to the Public Security Bureau and the gun and bullets were still there and had not been brought back. It was found that the defendants Xu Debiao and Du Baoliang, in September of last year, together with three fugitives, robbed a resident near the Yangshupu Bridge Electric Light Factory of property worth 53 yuan. These people have admitted to it at the police station. Ma and Tang and the gun and bullets should be transferred to the court for further investigation. Judge Xiao questioned the defendants, who were evasive in their answers, and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review at a later date.</p>

<h3>Repeated Miraculous Cures for Mental Illness</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinghua and Zhang Ziqin Discharged After Recovery</p>
<p>The population of this city exceeds three million. Since suffering from the pain of the January 28th Incident, many residents have been displaced. In addition, in recent years, the rural economy has collapsed and all industries have declined, leading to an increasingly depressed market, and those who suffer from this kind of pain commit suicide or suffer from mental illness. Mr. Gu Wenjun from Chuansha, based on his family's secret recipe for treating madness passed down for seven generations, pities the suffering of those with mental illness. Therefore, last summer, he founded the Shanghai Mental Illness Specialty Hospital in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road. Since its opening, nearly a hundred men and women with mental illness have been cured. It is heard that recently, Zhu Qinghua from Yuyao and Zhang Ziqin from Guangdong, two patients, were newly cured and discharged. Zhu and Zhang suffered from severe mental illness at first, but after one month in the hospital, they both recovered completely. Therefore, their families are deeply grateful.</p>

<h3>Attending Spring Banquet Unjustly Assaulted</h3>
<p>She Qifu from Yangzhou, 29 years old, is a driver at the Northern Railway Station Locomotive Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. At about 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, She went to a friend's house at Yuanyuli, Yucai Road, Zhabei, for a spring banquet. When he arrived, it was still early, so he was idly looking around at the entrance. At that time, there was a dice gambling stall in front of the Guangmao Timber Company across the road, and a group of gamblers was standing around gambling. For some reason, two of the gamblers suddenly had a dispute and were about to resort to violence. She stepped forward to mediate. Unexpectedly, one of the two was a relative of Jin Yusheng, the patrol chief of the Derun Road Police Station of the Third Division of the Fifth District, who believed that She's mediation was biased towards the other party. He ran to the police station to report to Patrol Chief Jin. Jin was furious upon hearing this and immediately led several police officers to the scene. Unexpectedly, the other party had already escaped. Jin then ordered She to be arrested and transferred to the Third Division of the Fifth District. After interrogation by Chief Wen, each was fined two yuan as a warning. However, after She was released, he was severely injured from being beaten along the way and has hired a lawyer to draft a complaint seeking legal recourse.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Can't Understand International Economic News (2)</h3>
<p>The questions asked in the letter are answered in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of the "Reading Guidance" founded by the circulating library of this newspaper is not only to serve the readers of this library but also to help all those who have dropped out of school and are eager to read to solve their reading problems. We believe that if we want the public to truly benefit from the library, it is not enough to simply provide many books. Given the current low level of culture among the general public, we have the task of helping readers select reading materials and solve reading problems. Therefore, we dare to take the risk of creating this kind of undertaking. Of course, this is a very difficult task. There is no precedent to follow and there is a lack of available reference materials. All of our work is in the trial stage. Therefore, we dare not make the scale very large at the beginning. We need to try it for a period of time to see how the results are before we dare to talk about development and popularity. We stipulate that participants are temporarily limited to the readers of this library, which is a helpless difficulty. However, we still hope to help those who cannot participate in the research of this department. Therefore, the "Reading Q&amp;A" published in this newspaper is not limited to those who participate in the research of this department. All letters with stamps affixed to this column and whose questions are reading problems will be answered by this department, and those that are generally relevant will be published in the newspaper. Mr. Chen and readers who want to know more can refer to the "Reading Q&amp;A Regulations" of this newspaper on January 4th of this year (published after the local news) and the "Origin of Reading Guidance" in the compilation of the library's book catalog.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the inability to understand terms and new nouns encountered in reading newspapers, we feel that there are indeed many people who feel this kind of pain. To solve this difficulty, we feel that we can only diligently look up dictionaries (see "The Use of Dictionaries" in this column on February 9th and 10th). However, judging from the questions asked by Mr. Chen, relying solely on looking up dictionaries is still not enough, because the difficulty lies in the lack of basic knowledge and the lack of browsing of newspapers and magazines. For example, in the several nouns cited by Mr. Chen, in addition to "Gold Embargo Lifted" and "Gold Export," the literal meaning of "The United States Buys Gold" and "Devaluation of the US Dollar" can also be understood. The reason why Mr. Chen does not understand is the questions "Why does the United States want to buy gold?" and "Why is the US dollar devalued?" Therefore, in order for Mr. Chen to solve these problems, he still needs to first read one or two books on the principles of the subject and read more newspapers and magazines. Social science can be roughly divided into two aspects: one is to describe social phenomena; the other is to explain or analyze social phenomena. The former is a narrative of facts; the latter is an analysis and explanation of the content or nature of facts. For example, "The United States Buys Gold" is a fact, while "Why does the United States want to buy gold" is an explanation of the content of the fact or the nature of the problem. We see people "performing magic tricks" and find it very mysterious, but if someone explains to us the techniques of "performing tricks," it is not surprising at all. Therefore, to study social phenomena, we must pay attention to observation, that is, know more about the actual situation, because it is very dangerous to understand theory without empirical evidence. However, if you don't understand the theory and only observe the facts, it is like watching "magic tricks." You only know that it is very "mysterious" but you don't understand it. This is the first point that Mr. Chen and those who feel the same way should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Society is constantly changing. It is definitely not stagnant. Therefore, new events are constantly occurring in society, especially in this era of great social change. As a result, "new nouns" or "modern language" are increasing day by day. For example, "Currency Agreement," "Gold Embargo Lifted," and "Gold Policy" are all facts that have occurred in modern times and now. To understand the meaning of these nouns, the first is to look up a dictionary, and the second is to read articles in current affairs magazines related to these kinds of nouns (because the words in the dictionary are added one by one, and the facts that happened at that time are rarely added to the dictionary immediately. And the news in the newspaper only explains the outline of the facts, so to know the elucidation of the content of the facts, you must read magazines.) This is the second point that should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Now let me introduce a few more books:</p>
<p>(A) General Theory. When studying economic phenomena, you should first read an overview book. Chen Baoyin's translation of the "Outline of Economics" (Lequn Edition) is a relatively complete reading material and is worth reading. However, this book is more in-depth. You should first read Chen Baoyin's "System of Economic Phenomena" (Lehua Edition). After that, if you like to study currency, you can read Hilferding's "Finance Capital" (Shenzhou Guoguang Society has a translated version, titled "Financial Capital"). As for the books you mentioned, they can only be used for reference later and should not be read when starting. In addition, you should also understand the current economic situation. After reading the above books, you will have a foundation in principles, but you still don't know the recent economic situation. Therefore, you should also read some books that explain the economic situation in recent years. Volga has a book "World Economy and Economic Policy" every year. Volga is a famous economist of the present era. His analysis can be said to be relatively accurate. So you should read it. Chinese translations of this book from 1929 and 1932 have already been published. (The former is the Shuimo Edition and the latter is the Shenzhou Edition).</p>
<p>(B) For dictionaries, you can refer to the books listed in the article "The Use of Dictionaries" on February 21st. I won't repeat them here. There are many domestic magazines about general current affairs. If you want to read them all, it will not only cost countless time and money, but it is also unnecessary. Therefore, you usually only need to read one or two kinds of magazines, such as the "Shen Bao Monthly" and the "Current Affairs Compilation." For other magazines, you can look for them at any time based on the topics you need to study. It is best to buy a "Periodical Index" (published by the Zhongshan Cultural Education Center) because this publication can tell you: which magazines have the topics you want to read.</p>
<p>Regarding the approach to studying "economics" and which books to read, this department has now commissioned experts to write "Economics Research Methods" to provide a systematic and correct indication for readers' reference. You can purchase it after it is published. However, according to your situation, you can read the books introduced earlier when you start.</p>

<h3>Science</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>Science was originally a tool for solving all the mysteries of the natural world, but unfortunately, in this day and age, science itself has become a mysterious riddle. Look, with two wings and a motor, you can cross the Atlantic. Put up an antenna, turn on the current, and people in the Eastern Hemisphere can face a small radio and listen to the sound waves broadcast from the Western Hemisphere. Movies are mysterious enough, but now, in addition to moving, they are playing a sound. The power of the motor is enough, and in this century, perhaps we can see robots that don't use motors and electricity, universally replacing the power of motors and manpower. These are not uncommon. It is said that recently, some people have been able to move the cornea of ​​a blind person into the eye of another blind person, restoring the latter's visual function. There is also a scientist who has successfully tested the control of the formation of male and female fetuses. These are all things that people have dreamed of for thousands of years, and no one dared to believe that they would be realized one day, but now, the old man of science has shown them to us one by one. How can we not admit that science itself is a mystery that is more difficult to break than everything in nature?</p>
<p>We don't have to worry about how mysterious this mystery is. In short, science has made great and immeasurable contributions to mankind, and has made great and indescribable achievements to the culture of the world, which no one can deny. But if we turn around and take a look, my God, the face of this old man of science is completely different. The old man of science we see is working hard to use airplanes and cannons to desperately kill humans and destroy culture. Recently, I heard that some people are planning to use radio to control submarines and extract a large amount of chlorine gas from salt. Therefore, people can generally imagine the situation of the future world war, and how this old man of science will work hard to kill humans and destroy culture in the future world war.</p>
<p>Are the past achievements of the old man of science worthy of praise? Are the future sins worthy of cursing? This is a difficult question to answer, because it is science that creates prosperity, and it is also science that creates economic panic.</p>
<p>Science is really a mysterious to the extreme mystery, beyond all the mysteries of the natural world.</p>
<h3>Playing Kingdoms</h3>
<p>— Meng Tao</p>
<p>Tonight, I'm playing "Playing Kingdoms" with my nephew. What is "Playing Kingdoms"? It's about creating a small world on a small square slate. Because it's a small world, it's full of turmoil and uncertainty.</p>
<p>War is inevitable: the opportunity for war is getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>When the whole board is covered with different colors; I became a great power in one corner; my country's name is replaced by China, and I proudly added "Great".</p>
<p>My nephew's situation has been mostly surrounded by me; if I only decide to fight again; then maybe it will be my world of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid, I am Xiaojieshi; so I am Japan. The current Japan is me." My nephew said stubbornly.</p>
<p>Perhaps China is always a big country; so things are done carelessly. In a moment of carelessness, I lost the punch.</p>
<p>The end result is that Japan should beat China.</p>
<p>So in a corner of the earth, enemy iron hooves are all over the place; a small circle is drawn in a corner of China, which is regarded as the target of the war.</p>
<p>It was really unexpected. Every time he drew a circle, my nephew couldn't hit the target. This time, I watched him draw casually, and the old China was lost in confusion.</p>
<p>In the midst of roaring laughter, I vaguely heard: "Ha! Ha!...The old China, that's how it is!"</p>
<h3>Offering Wine to Mr. Jin Songcen</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>I have a bottle of wine. Washing away Lord Su's thousand years of sorrow. His writings can move heaven and earth. But his refined spirit cannot be sullied by vulgarity. How can books avoid being burned by emperors? The people are all like Chu prisoners. We are responsible for the rise and fall of the nation. Poetry is no different from the Spring and Autumn Annals. (Mr. Songcen is skilled in poetry, and his works are mostly related to poetic history. Recently, he revised the general history and wrote many biographies).</p>
<h3>Bando Yin is Ordered by the Provincial Government to Visit Europe Again for Observation, and This Poem is Sent Off</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>I want to send you on a long journey with a long wind. My heart is filled with a thousand sorrows. The brothers in the Central Plains are all like siblings. The winds and clouds of the world are sweeping across Asia and Europe. How many people can compare to Ji Zha in diplomatic visits? My mind wanders, but I am only learning from Zhuang Zhou. When you compose Parisian verses again in the future. Will you still have the same heroic feelings as before? (Douyin visited Paris last time and composed several quatrains. His heroic spirit and unrestrained interest made people clap their hands when they read them. Now, the country's situation is deteriorating, and I am afraid that he will not be able to bear the difference between the past and the present.)</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-fourth: Drinking and Feasting, Crazy Merrymaking, and Containing Farewell Tears, Picking Lamps, Warming Dreams, and Singing Lowly Through the Long Night</p>
<p>After a while, he used a wooden tray to bring in two bowls of hot noodles and smiled at Ziqiang: Look how quickly I prepared them? Ziqiang said: It's quick, but I feel sorry for you staying up all night. Guizhi put down the tray, held the noodle bowl in both hands, respectfully, and put it in front of Ziqiang, and smiled: Even if it's tiring, it's only... the six words "just today for one night" were immediately swallowed, and then he said: If I could be so tired every night, I would be willing to. Ziqiang didn't want to ask further, so he picked up the bowl and ate the noodles. Guizhi didn't sit next to him and watch, but hummed and sang. Ziqiang picked up the noodles and looked at him and said: Why don't you eat some? Guizhi smiled: I'm happy to sing, I just want to keep singing, I won't be happy if I don't finish singing, I won't eat anything. Ziqiang thought he was telling the truth, so he didn't suspect anything. But at this time, the night was quiet, all the sounds had stopped, and any sound in the distance could naturally be heard clearly. Although Guizhi was sitting next to him, singing softly, the sound of the watchman's gong and clapper blown by the wind in the sky was still clear. Ziqiang understood that Guizhi didn't like to sing, but was afraid that he would hear the sound of the watchman's gong, which would not calm his mind, so he sang to distract him and cover up the sound of the watchman's gong. Looking at it this way, he was really well-intentioned. So he ignored the sound of the watchman's gong and listened to Guizhi's singing with his head shaking. After eating a bowl of noodles, he simply started singing himself, letting Guizhi eat the noodles. After singing a while of old songs, and then singing a while of Hua, he finally sang a passage of Qingyi in the Colored Building Match. Although the tune was out of tune and the taste was tasteless, he sang very happily. Guizhi thought that he had aroused Ziqiang's addiction to opera, so he sang loudly. He touched the teapot with his hand, the tea was cold, and he smiled: You eat noodles and then sing, it's salty and thirsty, I'll find some boiling water to make tea for you to drink. (321)</p>
<h3>The Baby's One-Month Celebration</h3>
<p>— Tang Zenggeng</p>
<p>I really can't bear to see my wife, who has suffered with me, pregnant for a full ten months. The sad, frowning, sallow face is still deeply in my mind. I also feel deeply uneasy and guilty about the trembling and pain during childbirth. Fortunately, the little life came to this world safely from birth, and now it has been a full month.</p>
<p>The baby's one-month celebration, Mom is happy, my wife is happy, and I am also happy, but because of the extreme financial difficulties recently, I don't want to have an unexpected expense for the one-month celebration, but for the sake of appearances, I have to reluctantly do it. Alas, for this false appearance, I really suffer for a lifetime.</p>
<p>"Today is Bao Bao's one-month celebration. No matter what, we have to find a way to do it. Besides, this is our first child," my wife said to me.</p>
<p>"Do it, how can I not want to do it? How can I not want to maintain appearances? But, without that damn money, what can I do?" I said with my head down, my face full of sadness and frustration.</p>
<p>My wife didn't say anything, and after a while, she said: "I still have two cotton-padded jackets here. You can pawn them first to get through this."</p>
<p>Thinking of this cold winter day, pawning my wife's only two cotton-padded jackets, I really feel a little uneasy, but my own have already been pawned, so I can only harden my heart and bite the bullet, carrying these two things, and under the snobbish eyes of the pawnshop owner, I exchanged them for two one-yuan bills.</p>
<p>With extreme displeasure, Mom and I bought some noodles, meat, and vegetables. It was for the one-month celebration of this first child. Although my face was full of forced smiles, my heart was extremely uncomfortable and sad.</p>
<p>We were busy all day, distributing the baby's one-month noodles to the neighbors, and we also invited several neighbors who lived together to have lunch together.</p>
<p>Meaningless, bland, we finally got through this baby's one-month celebration. I didn't feel any joy or pleasure, but only a painful scar was carved in the depths of my heart!</p>
<p>"Ah Gen's mother, oh my, I have never seen such a family. What one-month celebration for the first child, they did it so calmly. The one-month noodles were so bland and tasteless, and the meat was such a thin slice. When our Ah Mao had his one-month celebration, it was really more lively than them!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have lived for forty years, and this is the first time I have seen such a one-month celebration. Except for this simple meal, there was no excitement at all. To be honest, my usual dishes are better than theirs. Hmph, we were unlucky to see such an unlucky family."</p>
<p>In the quiet of the night, I heard the landlady and the sister-in-law in the front building whispering. I could only smile bitterly at my wife sadly. My wife could only shed tears. Alas, the baby's one-month celebration, the false appearances; this snobbish world!</p>
<p>New Invention</p>
<h3>Proof of Kerosene Curing Lung Disease (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, after I published my new invention of kerosene can cure lung disease in this column, I continuously received letters from Mr. Gao Yun, Bai Ou, Hong Ding, Wu Xieping, Gu Qian, Zhu Xinming, Zhang Guiheng, Wang Tongyi, and Wang Yi inquiring. The questions in the letters are roughly: (1) Requesting me to declare and disclose in detail to avoid patients from trying and harming lives? (2) Two or three out of ten compatriots nationwide suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis. If it is effective, it can save millions of lives? (3) Is the so-called kerosene the Asia brand, or the Mobil, Shell, and Monk Hat brands? (4) The number and time of drinking are still unclear? (5) What kind of side effects will occur after drinking, and will there be any danger? (6) Is this new invention hearsay? (7) The difference between kerosene and gasoline, etc. In order to prove and answer, I will translate in detail the thesis published by the special correspondent of the Japanese magazine "Housewife's Friend, Family Life Happiness Issue, New Year's Issue, and the facts proved by various medical doctors." (Please check the original text of the magazine from page 348 to page 365, entitled "Experimental Record of Curing Lung Disease with Kerosene" and the March issue of Housewife's Friend (236丨251) and "Kerosene Therapy for Tuberculosis" by Dr. Yamada Jushouichi, etc., but because this column is limited in space, it cannot be fully published after all, so I have to excerpt the main points and translate them to you. (1) Dr. Hayami Torazo, director of the Hyogo Prefectural Children's Research Institute, proved the results of the kerosene treatment for lung disease, which is 100% effective for 100 people. He said: Among hundreds of experimental subjects, only one had bad results. Why? Kerosene is originally an emulsion with strong bactericidal properties, and drinking it is harmless. I have been thinking about all kinds of facts and found it to be a very powerful discovery. The Russians and Eskimos have used kerosene as a substitute for wine since ancient times. A certain capitalist in Okayama Prefecture became healthy after drinking kerosene and later lived to be over 110 years old. None of the staff and workers in the Matsushita Kerosene Company in Yamaguchi Prefecture who work in the kerosene factory suffer from lung disease, but those who work in the office suffer from lung disease more often. After hearing these words, I hurriedly tried it on myself to check whether there were any harmful effects after drinking kerosene. However, although I did not suffer from lung disease, I coughed too much from smoking, so I drank kerosene 30 grams in several times, and as a result, my stomach and intestinal diseases and kidney diseases were completely cured. The most obvious phenomenon on the second day after I drank kerosene was increased appetite and sudden cessation of coughing. Afterwards, in order to check the bactericidal power of kerosene, I put tuberculosis bacteria in a culture dish and dropped a drop of diluted kerosene into the dish. The tuberculosis bacteria in the dish died without a trace. Now I am continuing to experiment with stone rats and rabbits, and the results have been published at the academic conference. After the experimental results, I am more convinced that it is safe and effective, so I advise people with lung disease to drink kerosene quickly. Now I will cite one or two cured examples to prove it. Mr. A, an assistant at a certain school, 27 years old, had both lungs ulcerated like honeycombs. In the past five or six years, he tried all treatment methods, and the condition went back and forth, and he could not be cured. Afterwards, he drank kerosene, 15 to 20 grams each time, and drank it six times in a week, and the lung disease was completely cured. Mr. K, a 22-year-old business student, was diagnosed with lung tip catarrh by the school doctor and a certain doctor. The inflammation disappeared immediately after drinking kerosene twice. Also, a friend of mine who suffered from spinal caries was also cured by drinking kerosene. We have a person working in the research institute who suffered from diabetes and was also cured with kerosene. In general, hundreds of people have asked me about drinking methods and have achieved good results. The effect has been as high as 100%. The method of drinking is slightly increased or decreased according to age and physique. But generally speaking, I drink 10 grams at first, and at most 15 grams. Gradually increase the amount from 10 grams. It is better to drink more times (one cup of kerosene is about 200 grams. It is best to buy a glass with grams engraved on it, so you won't have too much or too little.) The best time to drink is 9 pm. Stop dinner and drink before going to bed. Drink the second time after four to five days. Drink the third time after five days to a week. It is not difficult to drink, because you don't eat dinner, so you can avoid vomiting.</p>

<h3>New Interpretation and Criticism of Old Medicine (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>(5) Now let's discuss the old theory again. The Su Wen states that "if menstruation does not come, it is because the uterine pulse is closed. The uterine pulse belongs to the heart and is connected to the uterus. Now the qi is forced upwards to the lungs, and the heart qi cannot descend, so menstruation does not come." In general, heart qi descends and becomes blood. In women, it reaches the chest and descends, which is menstruation. If the qi is forced upwards to the lungs, then the true qi flows upwards, causing bitter mouth, dry tongue, and severe coughing when frightened. Expanding on this, blood comes from the heart and flows downwards, reaching the reproductive organs and becoming menstruation. This is a physiological phenomenon. If the qi is forced upwards to the lungs, then the blood flow is reversed, causing various symptoms. As for severe coughing, it is undoubtedly pulmonary tuberculosis that causes menstruation not to come. However, it is never mentioned that the disease is in the local part of the reproductive organs. The Golden Chamber also states that "because of deficiency and accumulation of cold, qi accumulates as a symptom, menstruation is cut off, and there is even prolonged cold blood accumulation in the uterine gate. Cold injures the meridians, and the coagulation is firm in the upper part, causing vomiting and saliva. Over time, it becomes lung carbuncle, and the body is damaged." In the end, accumulation of cold blood is the root cause, and over time, it becomes lung carbuncle. Lung carbuncle refers to the softening and rotting of lung tissue. This is already the late stage of pulmonary tuberculosis. This is another clear proof that menstruation is related to pulmonary tuberculosis. Zhang Congzheng said, "If menstruation does not come, do not take drastic hot medicines. If you take them, it will turn into lung consumption, bone steaming, tidal fever, coughing, pus, vomiting, and panting. The urine is astringent and stagnant, and sweating does not stop. Gradually, the body becomes thin and the pulse becomes large." These are all signs of late-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. Menstruation does not come because the body has already harbored tuberculosis. It is by no means caused by drastic hot medicines. Therefore, Li Qian said that if menstruation is not flowing, it is due to the four symptoms of deficiency, heat, fatigue, and qi not being regulated. Although these four symptoms have a very broad meaning, they are closely related to pulmonary tuberculosis. Deficiency means weakness. Heat means tidal fever. Fatigue means coughing up fatigue. Qi means difficulty breathing. It is not unreasonable to say that these four symptoms are caused by pulmonary tuberculosis. Wang Kentang's Zhizheng Zhunsheng states that "if a woman's menstruation is stopped, one of the three symptoms is that the spleen and stomach are damaged, food and drink are reduced, qi is consumed and blood is exhausted, and menstruation does not flow. The method should be to tonify the spleen and stomach, nourish the blood and qi, and wait for the qi to be sufficient and the blood to be produced, and the menstruation will flow by itself. Do not recklessly use menstruation-promoting agents, otherwise the central qi will be further damaged, and the yin blood will be further dried up, leading to consumptive diseases that cannot be saved." This clearly indicates that amenorrhea is caused by tuberculosis. Zhang Jiebin said, "If menstruation is gradually reduced and then stopped, and the hands, feet, bones, and flesh are painful, and the body gradually becomes thin, and tidal fever gradually develops, and the pulse is rapid, this is due to yin deficiency and blood weakness, and yang is rising. A small amount of water cannot extinguish the raging fire, and the fire forces the water to dry up, consuming body fluids." These are all signs of pulmonary tuberculosis. Kou Zongshi said, "If a woman is worried and thoughtful, she will injure her heart, and the blood will flow backwards and she will be thirsty. Her spirit will dissipate first, and her menstruation will stop first. Moreover, if she has heart disease, she will not be able to nourish the spleen, so she will not like to eat. If the spleen is deficient, then the metal will be deficient, so she will cough. If the kidney water is cut off, then the wood qi will not flourish, and the four limbs will be dry and withered, so she will be angry, her temples will be scorched, her muscles and bones will be withered. If the five organs spread, then she will die." Although these are all tuberculosis symptoms, there is no sign of uterine tuberculosis. Only pulmonary tuberculosis cannot be avoided. Therefore, Zhang Jingyue believed that there are different types of amenorrhea: blood obstruction and blood exhaustion. Obstruction is a temporary disease that can be cured by clearing it. Exhaustion comes on gradually and can be nourished by tonifying. Therefore, blood exhaustion cannot be treated by promoting menstruation. The so-called dry blood consumption belongs to blood exhaustion, and the principle is very clear. However, the cause of blood exhaustion must have its origin. The Abdominal Theory states that chest and hypochondriac fullness hinders eating, liver disease spreads to the spleen, and the patient hates the smell of blood and meat and clear liquid flows out. If the liver disease is accompanied by the lungs, then the patient will cough up blood. Hejian Six Books believes that young people who get drunk and enter the bedroom will exhaust their qi and injure their liver. If the liver is injured, the blood will dry up, and the spleen and stomach will transmit the disease, greatly depleting their blood, causing dizziness and irritability. Li Gao's Ten Books believes that blood and pulse fluids are transformed. Middle digestion causes stomach heat, and the patient eats well but gradually becomes thin, and fluids are not produced, so the muscles become thin and there is occasional thirst. The sea of blood is exhausted. The Introduction to Medicine states that after menstruation stops, excessive exertion, excessive intercourse, and eating dry and hot foods will cause fire to move, evil qi to flourish, and essence and blood to decline. Dongyuan also divides it into three causes: upper, middle, and lower. If the fire is in the upper part, it is caused by mental exertion. If the fire is in the middle part, the patient is prone to hunger and thirst. If the fire is in the lower part, the patient has constipation. In general, the cause of blood dryness is not limited to one factor. However, the so-called dry blood consumption originates from tuberculosis and belongs to blood exhaustion, so the cause of blood exhaustion should be the consumption of tuberculosis toxins, which affects the whole body, causing the eggs to not mature, and eventually menstruation does not come. It is definitely not caused by the local invasion of the congested and menstruating uterine lining by tuberculosis bacteria, causing anemia and interruption.</p>
<p>Based on all these factors and facts, Mr. Ding's so-called dry blood consumption is uterine tuberculosis, and he must have some basis for it. Otherwise, it is all speculation and not the truth. As far as I know, combined with the new theory and compared with the old theory, none of them match. It is difficult to accept. Is this a one-sided view of the new interpretation of old medicine? I ask Mr. Ding, what do you think?</p>
<h3>The Treatment and Prevention of Tetanus</h3>
<p>— Zhai Shaoheng</p>
<p>Umbilical tetanus is also known as tetanus. In my hometown, it is commonly called "locked jaw spasm," because when the disease occurs, the jaws become tightly closed, making breastfeeding impossible, hence the name. Regarding the cause of this disease, records from Hippocrates in ancient Greece, Europe, already identified its infectious nature. In 1884, Italians Galla and Rattone injected tissue fluid from around the abscesses of tetanus patients into rabbits, resulting in the same symptoms. The following year, Nicolaier and Rosenbach successively proved the spores and bacteria of this disease. Subsequently, Kitasato of Japan definitively determined the nature of the pathogen and the pure culture of the bacteria, making it clear that tetanus is caused by infection with tetanus bacteria. Today, in our country, still shrouded in mystery, except for a very small number of new doctors, people still hold absurd and unfounded beliefs. Superstitious people in my hometown believe that it is caused by someone opening or closing a lock in the room during childbirth. Therefore, before childbirth, all locks on boxes and drawers in the delivery room are usually opened to avoid the need to open locks when retrieving items during or after childbirth, believing this to be the only way to prevent the disease in the newborn. Therefore, those not opened before childbirth will not be opened within a certain period, even if necessary. If it is necessary to reopen what has already been opened, it is never locked again. Old doctors say that it is caused by wind entering the residual part of the umbilical cord after childbirth, so the umbilical area must be tightly wrapped. Considering that wind is generated by the flow of air, from the perspective of scientific medical bacteriology, this is not without a basis for misinterpretation. After all, the air contains countless kinds of bacteria. The purpose of wrapping is to avoid the entry of pathogenic bacteria. The so-called umbilical tetanus is actually caused by infection with what new medicine calls tetanus bacteria. Tetanus bacteria are a type of bacillus with one end enlarged, shaped like a mallet. They are extremely small and invisible to the naked eye. However, they can be clearly seen under a microscope. This bacteria primarily affects animals such as horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, and dogs. In countries with advanced medicine, it is now rare or nonexistent in humans. However, in our country, it is still seen from time to time, especially in newborns and infants. Once infected with this disease, it is almost certain death. Often, several children in a family die from this disease in succession, yet people still do not know the reason, which is truly pitiful.</p>
<p>This disease is always transmitted through wounds, so it is a wound-transmitted disease. If there is a wound on any part of our body, it can be invaded and cause this disease. It is not limited to the umbilical area of newborns. There is facial tetanus, caused by the entry of the bacteria through a wound on the face. There is puerperal tetanus, caused by the entry of the bacteria through a wound in the reproductive organs of a postpartum woman. Newborn tetanus is mostly caused by entry through the cut surface of the umbilical cord. Farmers are also sometimes affected, because tetanus bacteria thrive in the soil of fields and gardens. Traditional Chinese midwives often use broken pieces of bowls and tiles found on the ground as sharp instruments to cut the umbilical cord. If the bacteria are attached to these pieces, it is essentially directly planting tetanus into the umbilical area. Furthermore, the thread used to tie the umbilical cord and the cloth used to wrap it are invariably unclean. This is due to the ignorance of the midwives, leading to the transmission of this disease, resulting in the dire consequence of family extinction. It can be said that this is self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Now that the origin of this disease has been clarified, I will proceed to discuss the symptoms, prevention, and treatment of this disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>The incubation period for tetanus is four to ten days, and sometimes more than three weeks. During the incubation period, there are absolutely no symptoms. Therefore, minor wounds are often healed during the longer incubation period, without knowing that the bacteria have already entered the body and are spreading. The initial signs are that the patient first feels stiffness and tension in the muscles of the lower jaw, face, and neck. Subsequently, due to facial muscle tension, a peculiar facial expression develops. The forehead is wrinkled, the nasolabial folds are deep, and the mouth is pulled to the left and right. It is difficult to open the mouth, and the jaws are tightly closed. The facial expression changes so much that even the patient's own mother often cannot recognize them. Neck stiffness varies in degree. Some people’s heads bend backwards, while others can still move freely. As the stiffness progresses, it gradually affects the muscles of the abdomen and back, and then the limbs and trunk. The body is stretched out stiff like a dried fish. This is called opisthotonos. The muscles of the back and the muscles of the upper and lower limbs undergo sustained tonic spasms, causing the body to arch backwards in a bow shape, which is called arcus spinalis. The degree of tension is constantly increased by impulse-like attacks. These attacks are often triggered by slight stimuli. Frequent attacks are accompanied by severe pain. Moreover, because the patient's consciousness remains perfectly clear and their senses are not impaired, the distress they exhibit is truly deserving of sympathy. At this time, the secretion of sweat glands and tear glands increases, causing tears and mucus to flow due to pain, which is enough to make onlookers feel sorrowful. Body temperature rises, reaching as high as 40 to 44 degrees Celsius. Breathing and swallowing are difficult due to spasms in the chest muscles and diaphragm. Heart function is also accelerated, and the pulse rate increases to 100 to 120. With prolonged fever, there is slight protein in the urine. If the muscles of the urethra and large intestine spasm, urination and defecation become difficult.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>The only way to prevent tetanus in newborns is to strictly disinfect the scissors, suture thread, umbilical cord bandage, and the hands of the midwife used to treat the umbilical cord. When the umbilical cord first falls off, the newly formed granulation tissue is essentially a wound and a very good opportunity for tetanus bacteria to invade. Therefore, attention should be paid to this. The only way to prevent tetanus in postpartum women is to emphasize disinfection. For other unclean wounds and wounds with difficult-to-remove foreign objects that are suspected of tetanus infection, in addition to implementing the local treatment described below, injecting 20 units of antitoxin around the wound every day for eight consecutive days as a preventive measure is beneficial and harmless. Do not hesitate. It is a pity that the effectiveness of preventive serum is not as significant in humans as it is in animals.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>There is no specific treatment for this disease. Even in countries with advanced medicine, the mortality rate is still between 50% and 90%. In China, it can be called an incurable disease. Therefore, the most important thing is to pay attention to prevention. I will now describe the general outline of currently popular treatments for the reference of those who unfortunately become infected. However, because the treatment is complex and the symptoms are constantly changing, it is more convenient to treat in a hospital.</p>
<p>Tetanus treatment is divided into general, local, serum, and drug therapy. These are described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) General Therapy: The patient should be moved to a quiet room to avoid excessive stimulation from sounds and sunlight, so as to avoid the hyperactivity of the reflex mechanism. Nutritious food should be provided, paying close attention to nutrition. For those with jaw tightness or difficulty swallowing, nutritious enemas should be used. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Q&amp;A on Common Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(25) Croupous Pneumonia</p>
<p>(Q) What is croupous pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) It is a type of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, affecting one lobe of the lung. Therefore, it is also called lobar pneumonia.</p>
<p>(Q) In what season is this disease most likely to occur?</p>
<p>(A) This disease occurs most often in winter and spring.</p>
<p>(Q) How is it spread?</p>
<p>(A) It is mostly transmitted directly from patients to healthy people.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of a patient with croupous pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) The patient suddenly begins with chills and shivering, accompanied by fever. This fever is generally persistent.</p>
<p>(Q) How high does the fever usually rise?</p>
<p>(A) It is between 39 and 41 degrees Celsius, which is approximately equivalent to 102 to 106 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>(Q) What does the patient feel?</p>
<p>(A) The patient feels very sick and complains of headache, fatigue, thirst, vomiting, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) What other symptoms are there?</p>
<p>(A) Stabbing pain in the chest, rapid breathing, rapid pulse, and coughing also occur. In severe cases, there may be coma and delirium.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the state of the expectorated sputum?</p>
<p>(A) Starting from the second day of the illness, the patient expectorates rusty-colored, viscous sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae can be proven in the sputum.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any abnormalities in respiratory movement?</p>
<p>(A) The respiratory movement on the affected side is slower.</p>
<p>(Q) Are the digestive organs affected?</p>
<p>(A) Some patients have constipation, while others have diarrhea. Some even develop severe flatulence due to poisoning.</p>
<p>(Q) What changes occur in the urine?</p>
<p>(A) The urine is concentrated: containing some protein, but the salt content is reduced.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any changes in the spleen and blood?</p>
<p>(A) The spleen is enlarged; the number of white blood cells in the blood increases, and the number of eosinophils decreases. The number of Streptococcus pneumoniae seen in culture is related to the disease.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the course of croupous pneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) Typical croupous pneumonia lasts about a week; after sweating, the body temperature drops rapidly, and then enters the recovery period; however, in some cases, the fever subsides gradually. If the fever persists, there must be complications present: attention must be paid. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Various Infant Rashes</h3>
<p>— Hou Guangdi</p>
<p>In spring, childhood diseases such as measles and pox are most prevalent. Since the widespread practice of vaccination, smallpox has decreased daily. However, measles, rubella, scarlet fever, etc., are still common in densely populated cities. If the rash symptoms are not identified early, it can lead to errors in treatment or negligence in prevention. Therefore, I will briefly describe the various rashes in children below. I hope this will attract the attention of hygiene experts.</p>
<p>First, those belonging to the roseola group are solitary, small, round, red spots, sometimes transient. They disappear when pressed with a finger. There are six types:</p>
<p>(A) Typhoid rose spots: These are localized and fixed light red spots, appearing between the nipples and navel, usually in the second week of the illness, lasting only a few days. Sometimes they slightly resemble skin rash, reaching the size of a lentil, round and sparse. This indicates typhoid fever.</p>
<p>(B) Prodromal rose spots of various infectious diseases: These are transient and temporary, often preceding the onset of rash, such as chickenpox, post-vaccination rashes, meningitis, pneumonia, rheumatism, polyarthritis, sepsis, mumps, miliary tuberculosis, influenza, angina, pertussis, erysipelas, diphtheria, and other diseases.</p>
<p>(C) Toxic rose spots: Such as those caused by meat poisoning, sausage poisoning, etc.</p>
<p>(D) Rose spots caused by skin irritation: Such as wet compresses of medicinal solutions, etc.</p>
<p>(E) Sweat rash caused by sweat secretion: Usually in areas with excessive sweating.</p>
<p>(F) Rose spots of miliary tuberculosis on the skin surface.</p>
<p>Second, rashes resembling measles are irregular, less distinct spots. Initially, they are small spots that enlarge to the size of a lentil or larger. There are seven types:</p>
<p>(A) Measles (common name: "sha zi"): It starts with small, punctate vesicles, then becomes uneven small spots, densely arranged like stars, slightly raised or flat on the skin. Although there is a vesicular nodule in the center of the spot, it rarely forms a skin blister and may contain blood infiltration. This rash first appears on the forehead and then the face, spreading to the entire body within three days.</p>
<p>(B) Rubella (German measles): Resembles measles but without skin rash. It is slightly scaly, about the size of a lentil, slightly round, and rarely fuses together. Initially, there appears to be a small nodule in the center, which gradually disappears. Rashes on the mucous membranes (such as the mouth), fingertips, and soles of the feet are not seen. It often affects the limbs, mostly on the extensor surfaces. This rash disappears in just two or three days, and the body temperature does not rise.</p>
<p>(C) Infectious erythema: Occurs on the trunk.</p>
<p>(D) Rashes that accompany other infectious diseases: Such as diphtheria, chickenpox, and post-vaccination rashes, are often difficult to distinguish. Diagnosis relies on observation of other symptoms and the course of fever.</p>
<p>(E) Drug rashes: Such as those caused by antipyretics, green algae, ice, and serum injections. They often start with wheals (urticaria) accompanied by continuous fever and proteinuria. The rash often starts at the injection site, and symmetrical rashes appear on both limbs, spreading to the face.</p>
<p>(F) Atypical scarlet fever: The rash often clusters in several areas, interspersed with pale skin. It is more common on the body and less on the face, or even absent. The differences from measles are that it appears earlier and is accompanied by vomiting and angina.</p>
<p>(G) Atypical urticaria.</p>
<p>Third, rashes resembling scarlet fever are tiny, intensely red, dense spots appearing on a uniformly red background.</p>
<p>(A) Scarlet fever rash: Consists of tiny spots that initially appear separate and then merge with the red background to form a continuous sheet. Within hours, it spreads from the neck and chest to the face and body, and within 24 hours to the limbs. The triangle around the mouth is often spared, or the rash may be absent altogether. The rash on both cheeks completely merges together. There is significant high fever with slight itching and other associated symptoms.</p>
<p>(B) Fourth Disease (Dukes' Disease): Differs from scarlet fever in that the symptoms are mild, there is no mucosal involvement, and no other complications.</p>
<p>(C) Rashes of other infectious diseases: Such as typhoid fever, pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, diphtheria, and chickenpox. The difference from scarlet fever is the lack of red spots and the gradual merging of the surrounding red areas (before the onset of scarlet fever).</p>
<p>(D) Drug rashes and serum sickness: Such as those caused by ingestion of atropine, quinine, salicylic acid, opium, mercury, and injection of heterologous serum. The rash appears as early as the second day after injection or as late as twenty days, but mostly between the eighth and fourteenth days. It resembles scarlet fever, but the red color is slightly less intense and more diffuse. The affected area also resembles scarlet fever, but the intensity is reduced. It often starts at the injection site, causing nearby abscesses and proteinuria, and continuous fever. There is no vomiting or desquamation (unlike scarlet fever).</p>
<p>(E) Scarlet fever-like rashes in the convalescent stage of diphtheria: The rash resembles scarlet fever (and the serum rash mentioned above) even without injection. However, it is accompanied by tonsillitis and a positive Schick test. This syndrome is most likely a variant of scarlet fever that occurs after acquiring immunity to diphtheria.</p>
<p>Fourth, circular and arcuate erythema: Larger, raised red spots form a circle as the central area becomes less pigmented. They spread around the perimeter or merge with each other, or partially disappear, resulting in fantastic shapes.</p>
<p>(A) Polymorphous exudative erythema: Occurs on the outer aspects of the limbs and the backs of the hands and feet. It does not desquamate and is transient. It is often accompanied by fever, joint pain, edema, proteinuria, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>(B) Drug poisoning rashes: Such as those caused by quinine, salicylic acid, etc., and the injection of heterologous serum, are often associated with gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
<p>Fifth, syphilitic rashes are brownish-red or copper-colored round rashes that appear raised on the skin. There is no fixed exudate. These include macular syphilitic rashes, which can be seen on the palms and soles of the feet. They are faint and persistent, with a shimmering appearance, like a fresh slice. The outer edge is like a ring.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Prevention Drug and its Inventor, Guerin (4)</h3>
<p>(Translated by Havas News Agency from the October 14, 1933 issue of L'Illustration in Paris)</p>
<p>Moreover, the method of administration is the same for everyone. (Take three grams of B.C.G., divided into three doses, one gram per dose, taken within 24 hours, i.e., swallowed on an empty stomach half an hour before breakfast.) After three months, 82 people (i.e., 55%) had a reaction to the tuberculin test, thus becoming reactive. The proportion of people who become reactive is 10% higher than the proportion obtained from children who have received subcutaneous injections. At the time of publication of this article, the first bottled serum for oral administration to adults and two-year-old children has been delivered to the provinces.</p>
<p>The Fortress of Tuberculosis Prevention</p>
<p>All these organizations (laboratories, B.C.G. preparation, and animals and paper label cabinets used for testing) must be suitable for the great construction of the Pasteur Institute and France. For several months, the Tuberculosis Research Institute has been established in a three-story building, high on Falguiere Street, where the front door is located, and a five-story side stands above the garden of the Institute. The laboratories inside are the most beautiful in the world. Construction began three years ago, and was decided upon by Pasteur Institute Director Mr. Roux and the Institute's Board of Directors. The initial estimated cost was eight million, of which six million was allocated from the fund, and the remaining two million was provided by the state from horse racing taxes. In fact, the total cost of the project is close to ten million, because the building is based on simplicity and grandeur. The initial plans were made by architect Mr. Duquesne, but he died before the work was completed, so Mr. Bitterlin completed the work. Due to limited space, the writer cannot adequately describe this French scientific sanctuary, but in general, it can be divided into three parts: one part for the manufacture of B.C.G., one part for the chemical examination, and one part for the experimental animals and various attachments. The founders adhered to a principle of separating the department for manufacturing preventive drugs from the chemical examination department for culturing virulent bacteria. On the first floor facing Falgniere Street, under the direct supervision of Dr. Guerin, experts prepare materials for culturing B.C.G. vaccine, or engage in planting affairs, or emulsification of the original preventive medicine. The method uses a rotating electric device with rust-proof small steel balls to achieve this. After that, the medicine is poured into small bottles with a dispensing device, and the bottle mouth is sealed with fire. The scene on the second floor of the building seems the most miscellaneous. There is a large laboratory for practical work, which can accommodate 24 people working at the same time, studying various types of tuberculosis in humans or animals. In addition, there are laboratories for various directors, and the most peculiar laboratory, which can be called the "bacterial kitchen", which specializes in preparing the materials required for microorganisms and should be planted on them (i.e., potato, beef bile, etc.). In addition, the most interesting thing is the collection of various strains, each of which is labeled with an explanation of its history. There is a large cabinet divided into three compartments, which contains as many as 600 strains (from human strains to various strains of cattle, birds, and decaying grass). The style is the same, but the functions are different. If each compartment stores about 1,200 tubes, and each tube contains countless microorganisms (even if you use the number of 300 million or 400 million to describe it, you cannot describe its multitude), when we look at the door of this strain cabinet, we cannot help but feel reverence. Now we will not stay temporarily in the ten constant temperature rooms and the chemotherapy laboratories built on the roof, etc., but quickly visit the animal breeding farm. There are as many as 8,000 small animals there, all raised in two large rooms upstairs and downstairs, in lead-skinned boxes with iron steel, and each box has a number and activity beam label (written with the names of guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, etc.). Sheep and goats, etc., are kept in other rooms. In addition, there is a place for raising monkeys, with a total of 200 monkeys (this newspaper has talked about it for a long time five years ago), and there is a chicken farm near the roof, with 200 chickens. It is used for testing, just like guinea pigs. There are two dissecting rooms for the corpses of each dead or sacrificed animal. One is specially used for inspecting the animals that have received B.C.G., and the other is specially used for inspecting the animals that have been used for various tuberculosis research experiments. Now I have narrated to the end of the visit, and the main impressions I have gained are surprise and admiration. However, our French people sometimes like to belittle themselves, so they have also publicized the rudeness of our country's chemical examination rooms, even counting the number of broken windows, broken tables, and decayed equipment. May I ask if we are close to the truth? In fact, there has been great progress in various parts of France in recent years, such as the nursery school of the Medical College of the University of Paris, the new chemical examinations of the French Academy of Sciences, and the major sanatoriums in Bligny, Ainccurt, and Helfaut, etc. Today, French scientists are no longer the shabby figures in myths, and the equipment they need has also been manufactured exquisitely. The most important thing to do now is to promote and apply the inventions of these scientists, because there are still many doctors and people who still have the old concept of B.C.G. ten years ago. How can we know that preventive injections are limited to children in sick families? This is a thing of the past. Now all French people, especially children who have reached the age of schooling (as long as they meet the conditions for receiving seedlings), should enjoy this invention. Since the great era of Pasteur, this can be undoubtedly called the most miraculous invention. (The End)</p>

<p>(Beiping Communication) The 10th Far Eastern Games are scheduled to be held in Manila from May 12th. All preparations for my country's participation in the Games are actively underway. The preliminary selection meeting for my country's delegation to this Games will be held in Shanghai in mid-April. Regarding the basketball delegation, the National Sports Association has decided that North China and Shanghai will each select a team, and the final decision will be made after a rematch in Shanghai. Regarding the selection method for the North China basketball delegation, the Sports Association has sent a letter to the North China Sports Federation to handle it with full authority. The North China Sports Federation immediately convened a Standing Committee meeting to decide on all matters related to the selection time. It is reported that in order to actively promote the realization of the resolution, the Documents Division was specially responsible for drafting and issuing (1) a letter to each province and city requesting the selection of representatives to participate in the North China basketball team selection meeting, (2) a letter inviting selection committee members, and (3) a letter to each executive committee member soliciting opinions. At the same time, it also sent a letter to the National Sports Association of China inquiring about the issue of participating in the Far Eastern Games preliminary selection. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Resolution of Matters</h3>
<p>Hua Bei (North China) Sports Federation Standing Committee members Ma Yuehan, Yuan Dunli, Zhao Wenzao, and others, to discuss the selection of basketball representatives to participate in the Far Eastern Games preliminary selection, and whether to hold the North China Games swimming competition in advance, held an emergency standing committee meeting at 2:30 PM on the 19th, at Yuan Dunli’s private residence on Nanheng Street in Ping City. The meeting was delayed until 5:30 PM due to unforeseen circumstances. Chairman Ma Yuehan, recorder Yuan Dunli. After the meeting began, the chairman reported on the letter from the All-China Athletic Federation requesting the Federation to select basketball representatives in North China to go to Shanghai to participate in the Far Eastern preliminary selection. The following resolutions were made: (A) For the selection method of the basketball team, send a letter to each province and city to select basketball players to go to Tianjin for the preliminary selection. (B) The selection criteria are based on individual skills. (C) Dong Shouyi, Song Junfu, and Qi Yuyu were appointed as the selection committee members. (D) Dong Shouyi was appointed to be responsible for the guidance of the selected players. (E) The selection date was scheduled to begin on the afternoon of March 24th.

(G) Regarding all accommodation and hospitality matters for athletes from various provinces and cities in Tianjin, it was decided that Committee Member Zhao Wenzao would contact and notify them accordingly. (H) Zhao Wenzao was appointed to be fully responsible for the preparation of the selection matters.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Athletic Association</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, we have just received your letter stating that the 10th Far Eastern Games are scheduled to be held in Manila starting May 12th, and that preparations for our country's team selection and participation are underway. All specific measures will be formally notified after being discussed and decided at the board meeting of the Association at the end of this month. The preliminary selection meeting is scheduled for mid-April in Shanghai. Regarding the basketball team representatives, it has already been decided that the North China team and the Shanghai team will hold preliminary selections in Shanghai, and the elite players will be selected for use. We are writing specifically to inform you of this, hoping that your association will prepare a team of representatives to go south to participate in the preliminary selection in mid-April. We earnestly pray for this and look forward to your reply. As for the confirmed date of the preliminary selection and other related matters, we will inform you later. Upon receiving this, after deliberation by the second standing committee meeting of the association, it was resolved to send a North China basketball representative team to Shanghai in mid-April to participate in the preliminary selection. We are writing specifically to reply, and we hope you will take note of this matter. In addition to the basketball representative team, we earnestly pray that you inform us how to select representative athletes for other sports to participate in the Far Eastern Games. Respectfully, The North China Sports Federation, February 21st.</p>
<h3>Organizing a Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) After the All-China Athletic Federation decided that our country would hold preliminary selections in Shanghai before participating in the Far Eastern Games, it was further decided that the North China Federation would be responsible for selecting basketball representatives in the North China region. After receiving the letter from the All-China Athletic Federation, the North China Federation held a meeting in Ping City on the 19th to discuss the matter. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to hold the selection in Tianjin on March 24th. Dong Shouyi, Song Junfu, and Qi Shouyu were appointed as selection committee members. Zhao Wenzao was appointed to be responsible for the preparatory work of the selection. According to Zhao, regarding this selection, a committee will be established first to plan everything in advance. The most suitable location for the selection in the city is the Engineering Institute. The Engineering Institute is currently repairing the basketball court, and it is expected that there will be a very suitable court for use at that time. As for the organization of the preparatory committee, four sections will be established first: administration, hospitality, documentation, and publicity. Yang Shaoting will be invited to take charge of the administration section, Song Ruiting will take charge of the hospitality section, and Dong Yiru will take charge of the documentation section. In the future, athletes from various places coming to Tianjin will be accommodated at the Engineering Institute.</p>
<h3>Northeast Preliminary Selection</h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) The 10th Far Eastern Games will open in Manila on May 12th. Japan and the Philippines have already been actively preparing. Athletes from all over our country have recently begun practicing. Among them, the athletes from the Northeast region were the first to start. After several months of practice, it is reported that Liu Changchun's short-distance running, Tan Fuzhen's hurdles, Liu Renxiu's triathlon, and other performances have improved. The Northeast Sports Federation has scheduled a preliminary selection meeting to be held at the North and South campuses of Northeast University in early March to select representatives to attend the preliminary selection meeting in Shanghai in early April to select representatives for the Far Eastern Games. Since early March is approaching, the Northeast Sports Federation has specifically scheduled a meeting of the entire executive committee at 3:00 PM on the 28th in the conference room of the South Campus of Northeast University to discuss all issues related to the selection of representatives in order to be fully prepared in advance.</p>
<h3>Athletic Association Plans to Suspend National Zonal Football Competition This Year</h3>
<p>Letters sent to various regions have received no response</p>
<p>Conflicts with Far Eastern Preliminary Selection</p>
<p>According to the results of last year's meeting of representatives from various regions in Wuchang, the national zonal football competition for this year was originally scheduled to be held in Sichuan. However, due to the urgent anti-bandit warfare situation in Sichuan, it is difficult to hold the competition there, and there may be discussions about holding it elsewhere. Zhou Jiaqi, an executive of the All-China Athletic Federation, told reporters that the Federation has sent letters to various regions twice to solicit opinions on the location of the competition and whether to participate, but has received no response to date. The Federation also believes that the preliminary selection for participation in the Far Eastern Games will be held in Shanghai in April, and the national zonal football competition, even if held, will conflict with it. Therefore, the Federation plans not to hold this year's zonal football competition.</p>
<h3>Chinese and British Shooting Match: Li Gongying Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>British Butler Takes the First Impact</p>
<p>Begins at 5:30 PM Today</p>
<p>The long-awaited second Sino-British International Shooting Match will begin at 5:30 PM today at the Shanghai Amateur Shooting Association inside the United China Society at 27 Beijing Road. China's shooting king Li Gongying will take the lead, and Britain's Butler will take the first impact. The competition target is 750 points, and the match is expected to last about an hour and a half. Admission tickets are one yuan per person. As each side prepares to compete, the audience is bound to gather, and there may be overcrowding.</p>
<h3>Past Performance</h3>
<p>The Sino-British International Shooting Match in Shanghai began in March last year, hosted by the Shanghai Amateur Shooting Association. At that time, the Chinese team defeated the British team by a total of 834 points, winning the first championship. The Chinese representatives were Li Gongying, Shen Lince, Zhang Yingda, Liu Fuzong, and Xu Shizhang, five outstanding shooters. The British team was led by veteran Bernard, with Maxwell, Nema, Baker, and Marks as deputies. In five matches, China won four and lost one, securing the final victory.</p>
<h3>Current Strength</h3>
<p>The Chinese lineup remains the same as this year, but its strength is greater than in previous years. Shooting King Li Gongying has shown significant progress in his recent performance with world-class shooter Smith. Winning the enemy today is a foregone conclusion. The other veterans, such as Yan Lince, are experienced, and Liu Fuzong, Xu Shizhang, Zhang Yingda, and others have excellent skills. There is a great hope of winning the second championship together.</p>
<h3>British Lineup</h3>
<p>Most of the five British representatives have been changed. The absence of veteran Bernard is a great loss to the British team. New players such as Butler, Nicolls, and Greening are also among the best of their time. In terms of actual strength, there has been no significant improvement compared to last year, but if they can proceed cautiously when facing the enemy, their situation may be balanced.</p>

<h3>Western Sports Club Holds Handicap Race</h3>

<h3>Central University Establishes Educational Experiment Institute Outside the City</h3>
<p>Since Dr. Ai Wei took office as the dean of the College of Education of National Central University, he has been making tireless efforts to rectify it. In addition to hiring famous professors and enriching the Department of Education, he also suggested that the school establish an Educational Experiment Institute. It was approved at the school affairs meeting yesterday. The main purpose of establishing the institute is to solve educational problems through psychological and statistical experiments and to establish a Chinese-style scientific education. Based on his 15 years of experience in educational psychology experiments, Dr. Ai is convinced that educational problems cannot be solved solely by imitating methods. It is necessary to discover facts or truths through psychological experiments and statistical inductions. The institute will gradually conduct large-scale experiments based on this proposition. The internal organization is roughly divided into two major departments: research and exhibition. Each department has several groups. The research department has psychology and statistics groups, etc. The exhibition department has educational material collection, teaching aids, children's toys, primary and secondary school textbooks, psychological instruments, statistical charts, and other groups. The detailed organization is determined according to actual needs. It is reported that the school affairs meeting of the college has appointed Professors Ai Wei, Xiao Xiaorong, Du Zuo Zhou, and Xu Keshi as members of the preparatory committee for the Educational Experiment Institute, which will be formally established soon and will actively proceed. The institute plans to publish a special series on psychological and educational experiments in stages. The first issue is "Conditions for Determining Perceptual Units" (written by Xiao Xiaorong), and the second issue is "Chinese Character Measurement" (written by Ai Wei). The second special issue is already in printing and is scheduled to be published in early March. Professors Du Zuo Zhou, Xu Keshi, Zhang Shiyi, Zhao Yichen, Xia Zhanchu, Wu Nanxuan, Pan Shuishu, Wang Shulin, and others are also engaged in various educational experiments, and there will be more special issues to be added and published continuously in the future. If educational institutions have problems that need to be solved scientifically, the institute is very willing to accept their entrustment to conduct experiments.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Inspect Higher Education</h3>
<p>Departure Scheduled for March 1st</p>
<p>In order to investigate the status of higher education across the country and prepare for future improvements, the Ministry of Education previously sent Section Chief Xie Shuying and others to inspect various universities in Shanghai. Now, Chen Kezhong, director of the Natural Science Group of the National Translation and Compilation Bureau, and four or five Ministry of Education Commissioners including Guo Youshou and Sun Guofeng (it is said that Zhou Tianfang, director of the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office in Beiping, is also included, as well as an inspector of medical education from the Ministry of Health) will go to seven provinces and cities including Lu, Jin, Ping, Yu, E, Xiang, and Wan to inspect the national, provincial, public, and private universities, colleges, and vocational schools in those areas. It is reported that each member is scheduled to depart simultaneously on March 1st, first to Jinan, and then to Tianjin, Beiping, Baoding, Kaifeng, Wuchang, Changsha, Anqing, and other places in sequence. According to the Ministry of Education's schedule, the inspection will take 35 days.

<h3>Provinces and Schools Respond to the False Accusation Case of the Qixia Rural Normal School Principal</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Middle School sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Joint Association regarding the false accusation against Principal Huang of the Provincial Qixia Rural Normal School by the monk Jiran of Qixia Temple. (Omitted) A letter from all colleagues of the Qixia Rural Normal School stated that the monk Jiran of Qixia Temple colluded with witnesses, fabricated facts, and falsely accused Principal Huang Tongyi in the Jiangning Local Court. The judicial authorities arbitrarily sided with the accuser, resulting in the principal's defeat in the lawsuit. They hoped to receive support and attached a copy of the judgment and statement of reasons. Upon receiving this, it was found that judicial independence meant outsiders should not interfere. However, it was heard that the monk Jiran of the temple was cunning and fond of litigation, which was widely known. Over the years, his purpose had been to eliminate dissidents. Rural normal schools were the cultural centers of rural areas, and Principal Huang was the leader who worked hardest to promote culture. The school was located near the temple, and Jiran harbored sinister intentions, viewing others as he viewed himself, believing that Confucianism and Buddhism could not coexist. He harbored resentment in his heart and made repeated unsuccessful attempts. Last year, he colluded with a group of unscrupulous people to file a lawsuit, which resulted in his defeat. As a result, his resentment deepened. It was believed that the rural normal school was a nationally renowned school, and Principal Huang was an expert in implementing rural education. How could they allow him to be implicated in public affairs and cause such a great loss to the future of rural education? It was proposed that the association make a public decision to provide strong support, and at the same time, report the crux of the problem to the provincial office to protect Principal Huang, and publish the facts in the newspapers to solicit strong opinions to awaken the attention of the legal community. In addition to sending telegrams, it was requested that the facts be presented to the council for a public decision. It was heard that the school association had submitted it to the standing committee for discussion and would have a serious response. It was also heard that the faculty and staff of schools such as the Provincial Zhenjiang Normal School had also responded one after another, arousing the attention of all sectors of society and preventing those serving in provincial educational institutions from being destroyed.</p>

<h3>The School Rent Reduction Committee Asks the Mayor to Express His Opinion on Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Shanghai's Rent is the Most Expensive Among All Cities in the World</p>
<p>The Poverty of Citizens is Sacrificed for the Wealth of Landlords</p>
<p>All Schools Suffer from Rent Pressure and Find it Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>The Shanghai School Rent Reduction Movement Committee wrote to Mayor Wu yesterday, saying, "Mayor Wu, we pay our respects. In recent years, Shanghai's situation has been affected by the global economic downturn externally and the collapse of the rural economy internally. Industries and businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy, and people's livelihoods are in dire straits. Your Honor has been in charge of Shanghai for two years, and we deeply admire your detailed plans for the prosperity of this great Shanghai. Now,</p>
<h3>Society is Gradually Approaching the Brink of Ruin</h3>
<p>Municipal facilities face many difficulties, and the prosperity of Shanghai is even more unattainable. This is a shared pain for all three million citizens of Shanghai, and we believe Your Honor shares the same feeling. Due to the decline of the social economy, the price index is gradually showing signs of decline, while housing rents have become increasingly expensive due to the monopoly of real estate operators in recent years. The majority of citizens' monthly income is used for the insatiable exploitation of landlords. The level of expensiveness is the highest among all cities in the world. Therefore, in less than a month, the rent reduction movement has gained momentum. It is not something that a few people can promote, but a social trend and a consistent demand of all citizens. Our committee has nearly a thousand schools in Shanghai that rent houses, all of which are under severe pressure from high rents. Maintaining the status quo is already difficult, let alone development and expansion. Education is a social undertaking, a century-old plan for the country, and the lifeline of the nation. The implementation of rent reduction is more urgent than for shops and organizations. Therefore, we have gathered various schools to organize groups and work together, hoping that Shanghai education will be revived and</p>
<h3>Build a Century-Old Foundation for the Prosperity of Great Shanghai</h3>
<p>Previously, it was reported that a committee member of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Movement Committee said that the rent reduction movement is the hope of Shanghai citizens and one of the municipal facilities. After two months, the municipal authorities have not expressed any opinion, and there is nothing to follow, so he requested to resign. Our committee would like to express our most sincere intentions and send this letter specifically, respectfully requesting you to provide guidance for us to follow. We wish you well. The Shanghai School Rent Reduction Movement Committee."</p>

<h3>The President of Ginling College Gives a Lecture on Impressions and Thoughts of Traveling in the United States</h3>
<p>The Huadong Christian Education Association of this city held a members' fellowship meeting at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA last night at 7 p.m. Dr. Wu Yifang, the president of Ginling College, Nanjing, was specially invited to speak about her impressions and thoughts of traveling in the United States. More than 60 principals of various churches, guests, and others attended, making it a grand occasion. Yang Xizhen, the principal of McTyeire School, presided over the meeting and gave a speech. Then, Ms. Wu gave a speech about her personal observations, briefly saying that she attended three major conferences. The first time she participated in the World Women's Conference was after the Chicago Exposition in July last year. Although the representatives from various countries were not many, the conference was still successfully opened. She felt that the American women's movement has been making great progress in recent years, without fear of hardships. All sectors have expressed their support for women's participation in politics. On the other hand, it is impossible for Chinese women to seek economic independence in society. The difference is too great. This is a matter for the women themselves, and women must be aware of it themselves. The second time she participated in the Fifth Pacific Science Congress, also in Chicago. This is a regular meeting held every two years, and the discussion was only about the security issues of countries along the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Hu Shi has already given a detailed report on this matter. The third time was to participate in the general assembly of the Missionary Association's traveling lecture group. After more than 80 days, she visited 32 cities in 16 states. The number of listeners exceeded the previous record. The current economic downturn is not limited to a certain country or region, but has become widespread and acute. This time, she spent a short time in the United States and did not have an in-depth study of its national conditions. However, the biggest thing she saw on the surface was the problem of unemployment. Many people came from other provinces to seek work, but they did not have money to stay in hotels, so Central Park was full of people. The state of sleeping in the open air was pitiful. Therefore, there were many relief organizations to help people avoid starvation. Major middle schools and universities were also facing salary cuts, some even up to 50%, but it was still difficult to continue. The degree of economic downturn can be imagined. As for the perfection of the facilities and the seriousness of the management, we can learn from them. For example, if the principal wants to give a speech to all the students, he does not need to gather them in the auditorium. He can just talk in his office at any time. The builders of high-rise buildings often built half of them and did not have the money to continue building. Although the number of cars on the street has increased compared to previous years, most of them are old and broken. The coolness of the stores and the lack of attention to the writing rooms are deeply affected by the world trend. However, since President Roosevelt took office, his recovery plan, currency inflation, increased production, and reduced unemployment have attracted worldwide attention. In terms of unemployment alone, there were more than 18 million people unemployed in the previous year, but now it has been reduced to more than 80%.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai North High School Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Principal Tang Reported on the Rebuilding Process</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the school buildings and equipment of the Shanghai North High School on Yongxing Road in Zhabei were completely destroyed. Then, with Principal Tang's painstaking efforts and perseverance, the school buildings were rebuilt and completed, and classes were resumed. Yesterday afternoon at 6 o'clock, Principal Tang Boqi and Chen Kecheng, a member of the Rebuilding Design Committee, hosted the press at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to report on the school's erroneous process and to express the hope that the public opinion community would do its best to advocate for the education. Zhang Zhuping, Yan Duhe, Ma Chonggan, Guan Jiu'an, Hu Shuyi, and others from various newspapers, more than 30 people, attended. Tang and Chen, as well as Wu Heshishi, a representative of the school board, gave reports first, and then Zhang Zhuping, a representative of various newspapers, gave a reply. The event ended with joy.</p>
<h3>The Department of Education of Guanghua University Bids Farewell to Director Xie Xunchu as He Takes Office as Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of Anhui University</h3>
<p>The Department of Education of Guanghua University enjoys a well-deserved reputation and has long been respected by people in society, thanks to the painstaking efforts of Director Xie Xunchu. Xie is a contemporary educational expert with extensive knowledge. The teaching between teachers and students on weekdays is very sincere. Now Xie has accepted the appointment as the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Chairman of the Department of English at Anhui University and must set off in a few days. Although President Zhang Shouyong and representatives of the students of the Department of Education have repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay, Xie is ultimately concerned about his hometown and cannot refuse his duty. The students of the department, with regret, gave Xie a farewell dinner at Zhimei Lou on Sima Road yesterday afternoon. During the dinner, students He Kaixuan, Deng Rongling, and Pan Chuanzan gave speeches one after another, expressing a great sense of reluctance. Later, Xie replied with a speech, giving a lot of encouragement and hoping that the students would work hard in their studies and not be sad about the separation. After the dinner, they took a group photo as a souvenir. Teachers and students enjoyed themselves and the event ended.</p>
<h3>The YMCA Night School is Scheduled to Open</h3>

The school has a long history and has been established for more than 30 years. No fewer than thousands of students have graduated and taken up positions in various fields. Starting this semester, many more teachers have been specially hired to take charge of various courses, and tens of thousands of dollars have been spent on improving the equipment of biology, physics, chemistry, and the library.

Wu Xingya will serve as the chairman of the school board, and Tang Zengyang and Xu Zexiang will be appointed as the president and vice president. The previously determined school address on Robison Road is now insufficient for use, so it has been rented to 56 Huolong Road, Taierzhuang Road as the new school address. (Right across from the French Garden) The location is central, the air is fresh, and the transportation is convenient, making it a great place to study. It is heard that the office has started working and registrations have been very enthusiastic in recent days.</p>
<h3>News from Various Schools</h3>
<p>Tzu Hang Midwifery School: Tzu Hang Midwifery School, located at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Wuding Road in this city, has been in operation for four years. The teaching and management are conscientious. Starting this semester, the school principal, Song Jian, and the Dean of Students, Wang Xuequan, are planning more carefully for school administration and student academics, aiming to cultivate useful talents for obstetrics and serve society. The number of students at the school has increased by over a hundred this semester. Therefore, the original school buildings are no longer sufficient. A whole Western-style house in Xiude Lane on Wuding Road has been specially rented to expand the school's facilities. It is also heard that there are not many vacancies in each grade, but those who have a real interest in the knowledge and skills of obstetrics can still go to the school and request permission to register for admission.</p>
<p>Hu She Vocational Supplementary School: The Hu She Vocational Supplementary School, which was prepared by Mr. Yan Junxuan, a principal of a primary and secondary school in Shanghai who is from Huzhou, has now been completed.

<h3>Fate</h3>
<p>— Ni Shuoer</p>
<p>Mr. Zonghan pointed out with emotion that the poor old woman in the movie "Sister Flowers" said to her poor daughter: "Poor people are always poor, you have to be patient!" This is called "the philosophy of the poor."</p>
<p>Naturally, this teaches people to be content with poverty, which is based on "fate." Many sages of ancient and modern times have advocated this theory, but there are also "always" quite a few poor people who are not content with poverty. "A wise man may still make a mistake." The "mistake" here is that a person's fate "is always" unknowable until after the coffin is closed.</p>
<p>There have also been people who predict fate. Fortune tellers and astrologers are everywhere. However, they are rarely willing to determine that their patrons will be poor to the end. Even if they do, everyone's theories cannot be consistent. A says they should be poor, but B says they should be rich. This makes the poor unable to believe in their fixed future fate.</p>
<p>If you don't believe in fate, you can't "be content." The poor buying lottery tickets is a kind of "unreasonable expectation." But this is not without benefit to the country now. However, "every advantage has its disadvantage." Since fate is unknowable, why can't the poor dream of becoming emperor? This led to the appearance of the "Tui Bei Tu" in China. According to the Song people, during the Five Dynasties, many people looked at this picture and named their sons, hoping to correspond to the auspicious signs of the future, until Emperor Taizong of Song (?) drew one hundred copies at random and circulated them with other books. Readers saw that the order was very different and could not agree on which was the correct version. Only then did people stop treasuring it. However, during the September 18th Incident, Shanghai was still selling newly printed copies of "Tui Bei Tu."</p>
<p>"Contentment with poverty" is indeed the key to peace in the world, but if there is no way to specify the ultimate fate, it will not be possible to make people give up completely. Modern eugenics can be said to be scientific, and some people in China are advocating it, hoping to help the theory of fate, but history just doesn't cooperate. The father of Emperor Gaozu of Han was not an emperor, and Li Bai's son was not a poet. There are also biographies that talk endlessly about who in the West succeeded through adventure and who got rich empty-handed.</p>
<p>It has a clear record that the theory of fate is not enough to govern the country and pacify the world. If you still want to use it as a tool, then China's fate will really be "poor" and boring.</p>
<h3>About My Creation</h3>
<p>— He Jiahua</p>
<p>A week ago, a friend told me that a Mr. Scavenger on a certain publication scolded me, saying that I was a rising star of the "Shanghai School," and all my novels were written by Mr. Xu Zhuanfeng and Mr. Chen Fuxi. In Shanghai, scolding people is not a big deal. It seems that I have been scolded several times, but I have never made any statement or intended to defend myself, but this time I can no longer remain silent.</p>
<p>The fact is very obvious, my style is completely different from the styles of those two. It is a recognized fact that a writer's style is closely related to his personality. My mind is very narrow, my actions are very restrained, and I like to get to the bottom of everything and analyze it in detail. I am not willing to relax even in the smallest places. This conservative, perhaps backward, temperament is clearly reflected in my work. Although it cannot be said mechanically, generally speaking, my works have the following characteristics: (1) tight layout (2) delicate description (3) very careful use of words and sentences. I love psychological descriptions and landscape descriptions the most, and I am most satisfied with these two. The works of Xu and Chen are completely opposite to me. They write more concisely. They have always neglected the points that I pay attention to. I like twists and turns, but they love straightforwardness. I like gorgeousness, but they love simplicity. This difference in style and technique can be understood by simply looking at our works and making a comparison. As for the content, we are also far apart. My material is often very trivial, very ordinary stories, with a bit of philosophical meaning, and sometimes it is completely rural, with a poetic romance, which is absolutely different from the materials they use. Moreover, most of my works are written in the first person, and I like to set off the story as warm and enthusiastic, while they consistently use the third person, cold and plain, a bit like the style of naturalism. Readers can easily distinguish this difference after reading our works.</p>
<p>I have always been honest in my writing, and I have never wanted to try anything that is sloppy. Although I am good friends with Xu and Chen, there is absolutely no collusion in passing articles privately. "The beauty of a wife belongs to others, the goodness of an article belongs to oneself." Who would be willing to give away their proud work to relatives and friends? I do not deny the fact that there are famous writers in Shanghai who buy articles from unknown writers, but I am not a well-connected famous writer, and they are not unknown writers who are hitting walls everywhere. How could I have bought their manuscripts? Mr. Xu has recently published his articles in various magazines, and Mr. Chen has published several collections in Guanghua Guangming. Would they worry about not having a way out?</p>
<p>I write articles very carefully. There are novels that I have reviewed several times, and even short essays I don't relax, carefully considering and revising each word and sentence. Although there are times when I deal with it carelessly, it is not very often. For example, the few pieces that I am more satisfied with and that have been praised by others: Cat, On the Lake, Rainy Day, Waterwheel, Prison Break, and Slipping into the Wheels Again have all been revised several times.</p>
<p>Mr. Scavenger wants to use his "historical brush" to clean up the literary world. His courage and acumen are admirable, but he did not present any evidence, and he did not use his real name, which inevitably makes people suspect that he is spreading rumors. This kind of rumor-mongering and slanderous behavior is probably a "Shanghai School" trick.</p>
<h3>"Economic Independence"</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xiyu</p>
<p>Before graduating from middle school, I often fantasized like this: after graduation, how to find a job to become economically independent and avoid being angry with men. Yes, I graduated. When I went into the society, all the jobs were not what we women could do; ah, it turned out that everything we learned was useless! However, in order to implement my idea of "economic independence", I still tried to "hit" as much as possible; but when I hit the east, I heard about the economic panic, and when I hit the west, I heard about the unemployment panic, not to mention that I was just a middle school graduate! Suddenly there was good news: Company X fired a dozen male employees who asked for a raise and went on strike, and recruited women to supplement them. I had been sitting at home for more than a year, so I was not willing to let go of this opportunity. Although I heard that the salary of female employees was half that of the fired male employees, I still felt very happy and satisfied!</p>
<p>The female colleagues who came in with me were very gentle and often smiled at me; but I looked down on them a little: they paid attention to dressing up, their faces were white, their mouths were red, their hair was permed like lion heads, and the perfume that helped the temptation of meat filled the entire office from their bodies, attracting those male colleagues to often move their noses and explore in the air. But since they were able to run out of the boudoir to be employees, they were considered more progressive women. I sometimes thought like this.</p>
<p>The male colleagues were certainly a little jealous of us, because not only did our entry break their request for a raise, but also their rice bowls were even more insecure in the future, because the manager could always recruit some women to replace them. But because we were "women", they were finally very happy, listened respectfully to the manager's instructions, and patiently guided us to copy this and do that.</p>
<p>As for the manager, he treated us very specially: next to our seats, he specially placed a warm electric stove; every afternoon, he often asked the tea room to send snacks for us to eat. His hair was particularly shiny, and he often stood by our side, guiding this and inspecting that. He took the opportunity to talk to us, or argued with us with a laugh, about what movies, how to dance, and so on. Once he even "called" us to attend his family's tea dance party, and even "took" us to see a movie.</p>
<p>Of course, the next day I heard the male colleagues laughing from their noses.</p>
<p>We were originally able to go home at 5:00 pm every day. But when the male colleagues had left the office, the female colleagues were still buried in their work. I felt too embarrassed to leave alone; but if I waited, I always waited for more than an hour or two, until everyone had figured out everything in the company before they put on their powder and went out. Therefore, the manager praised us in public. But this praise aroused even more resentment from the male colleagues.</p>
<p>"Rotten goods," "fox spirits," as soon as the manager turned around, these dirty names were passed from the male colleagues. I looked at the female colleagues, their faces were red, their heads were lowered, and they were silently doing their own work.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is called economic independence!"</p>
<p>When I angrily left the company, I don't know who threw a sentence behind me:</p>
<p>"Vase!"</p>
<h3>Spending the New Year in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>XX:</p>
<p>Friend, I really didn't expect to spend the New Year in Guangzhou this year!</p>
<p>I remember this time last year, we happened to be living on Mount Saint-Thierry in France. On New Year's Eve, a few of us friends agreed to go to Old Shen's house to eat roast chicken, drink wine, play cards, and make noise until dawn. We were having a great time, and you said, "We don't know where we will spend the New Year next year"? "I will definitely be at home," I answered you firmly. Who knew that I would be spending the New Year in a foreign land again this year! I haven't been home for the New Year for twelve years. Imagine how unfortunate this is!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this is the second time I have celebrated the New Year, because we have already passed a Gregorian New Year. However, the Gregorian New Year is just a matter of government offices hanging up flags, and the common people still celebrate the New Year at the end of the lunar year, no matter how you say that the lunar calendar has long been reduced to a "废历" (waste calendar). The old customs that have been followed for thousands of years cannot be abolished by a piece of paper order. Having said that, schools force classes, and elementary school students don't have time to run out to play, which naturally detracts from the New Year. In addition, the recession in Guangzhou this year makes the New Year less lively than in previous years. However, in the eyes of us "waijiangren" (people from other provinces), the New Year in Guangzhou is still lively, indeed much livelier than our hometown.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is the flower market. From the 24th or 25th day of the twelfth lunar month, many flower stalls are set up on both sides of the street, selling fresh flowers. In our hometown, every household inserts evergreen cypress for the New Year. Cantonese people like to offer fresh flowers. This shows that the degree of Westernization in Guangzhou is much more advanced than in our small inland cities. Some flower stalls are specially built, with a wooden frame with layers, and many small flower pots are placed on each layer; some do not use flower pots. The people selling flowers insert the broken flower branches into bottles, with all kinds of bottles, from Shaoxing wine jars to glass bottles from pharmacies. This Yonghan North Road, where cars are like flowing water and horses are like dragons, suddenly becomes a beautiful garden, with buds of peony and various roses, foreign chrysanthemums, camellias, kumquats, ink orchids, everything, but red plums, daffodils, and "hanging bell flowers" are the most numerous. Some flower branches stand there taller than people. They are chopped from the trunk of the tree, and many tender buds are hung on them.</p>
<p>The flower market not only sells flowers, but also other small businesses take this opportunity to earn some money for the New Year. There are a few antique stalls, with some old goods piled up in a mess. They are really far inferior to the antiques displayed at the Beijing Changdian Temple Fair. Therefore, wealthy patrons walk past these stalls without even glancing at them. There are also people selling vases, with many vases on the ground, each with an "antique flavor", but the era is probably the 22nd year of the Republic of China. It is said that there is a place near Guangzhou that specializes in making antique bottles. The second is the children selling "lai see envelopes", spending a dime can buy three or four bundles of this mud gold printed small red envelope bag - this is used for the New Year's reward money. There are also many people selling almanacs, which naturally refers to the "廢歷" (waste calendar), because ordinary calendars are the patent of major bookstores, and small businesses have no share.</p>
<p>From the 24th or 25th day of the twelfth lunar month, there are more and more people coming and going on the street. Many of them are here to watch for nothing. "Old Cantonese" always wait until the 30th night to buy flowers, because the flower stalls are rushing to close the market and the prices are cheaper. On the 30th night, as soon as I finished eating, I ran to the street. The streets are full of people, and the sidewalks on both sides are unbearably crowded. There are also many tourists in the center of the street. The cars honk and can't move a step. Cantonese people come to buy flowers at this time. Here, a fashionable girl is holding a pot of daffodils with buds in her hand; there, an old man is holding a branch of cinnabar plum; many people buy "hanging bell flowers", how beautiful the flowers that bloom are! I walked half of Yonghan Road and it took me half an hour, which reminded me of watching the "Flower Festival" in my hometown on March 3rd when I was a child. Chinese people love to watch the excitement everywhere is the same.</p>
<p>On the first day of the first lunar month, I got up early in the morning and ran to the street. It was quiet, and the ground was covered with firecracker paper. Cantonese people originally love to set off firecrackers, and they want to set them off to their heart's content during the New Year. Some of the shops on both sides of the road have their doors closed, and red paper strips with the words "Seven Stars Shining, Magpie Entering the Door" are pasted on the doors; some have their doors half open and half closed, and we can see people playing cards inside. A group of wild children surrounded a stall selling toys. The people selling light air balloons are busy setting up glass bottles, a few drops of sulfuric acid, three or four zinc sheets, and in a while, the rubber bag gradually grows larger, and the people watching next to it feel surprised. "Selling red pigs" is called everywhere on the street, mud piggy banks, this is a lucky item, buying them can make you rich. There are also people selling clams, carrying burdens and selling them from house to house. Cantonese people eat clams during the New Year, just like Italians eat eels during Christmas. Although my hometown is also on the coast, there is no such custom.</p>
<p>As for how Cantonese people spend the New Year at home, if I am still here next year, I will tell you then.</p>

<h3>After the Implementation of Japanese-American Controls</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>The implementation of the Japanese Rice Control Law was outlined in general terms in Issue 47 of this publication. What are its effects? This is a matter of concern to those in our country who are concerned about the food supply. Therefore, this article briefly describes the situation of the Japanese government's handling of rice after November of last year, along with its increases, decreases, and changes, as a reference for us to discuss controlled food.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Japanese Rice Control Law, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs jointly held a Rice Advisory Committee on December 6 of last year, and also consulted with the Ministry of Finance to proceed with the policy. The grain storage plan was then established, totaling ten million koku of grain in Japan's mainland and colonies. The outline is as follows: (A) Japanese Mainland: (1) The mainland will store six million koku of grain produced this year, but depending on the situation at the time, storage may continue, and new grain produced in the ninth year (of Showa, i.e., 1934) may also be stored. (2) Storage will be subsidized with incentive money. (3) In addition to the incentive money, low-interest financing will be available. (4) The storage period is one year, until the autumn of next year. Disposal will be subject to a permit system. (5) Even after one year, sales will not be allowed if the rice price does not reach a substantial amount. (6) For the purpose of grain storage, 450 state-run warehouses will be built nationwide, with free storage. The storage capacity of the warehouses will be 10 warehouses capable of holding 100,000 koku each, 40 warehouses capable of holding 50,000 koku each, and 1,400 warehouses capable of holding between 1,000 and 5,000 koku each. (7) In addition, small warehouses will be established in units of ten villages or towns, to be built nationwide, funded by landlords, as a reserve for famine relief. (B) Colonies: (1) Korea will store 3 million koku, and Taiwan will store 1 million koku. (2) The government will provide incentive money. (3) Low-interest financing will be available. (4) The storage period will be a relatively long period, and disposal will also be subject to a permit system. (5) Various new warehouses will also be established in Korea and Taiwan. (6) Korea will start from the preparatory period, and Taiwan will implement it from the first harvest of this year.</p>
<p>As for the method of storing six million koku of grain in the Japanese mainland, the result of the national conference of directors of internal affairs of each prefecture was as follows: (A) Implementation Guidelines: (1) Approximately six million koku of grain produced in the mainland in Showa 8 (1933) will be stored autonomously by farmers. (2) The government will adapt to the local conditions to have prefectures, cities, towns, villages, industrial associations, agricultural associations, etc., store the grain. (3) For the storage of grain, a corresponding subsidy will be given in accordance with the rice storage incentive regulations, taking into account interest, storage fees, transportation costs, and other items. (4) The grain shall not be sold unless it rises to 15% above the minimum rice price. (5) If it is deemed necessary to store the grain after April of Showa 9 (next year), storage warehouses will be built in accordance with local conditions, and subsidies may be given to borrowers. (6) Storage of the aforementioned grain will be free of charge, but a portion of the handling fee will be subsidized. (7) The stored grain shall not be sold until the end of the rice year, but subsidies for a fixed amount may be given for disposal of damaged, reduced, deteriorated, or stale grain after storage has begun. (8) A fixed amount of subsidy will be given for the inspection and supervision costs of each prefecture. (9) The proportional amount of grain stored in each prefecture will be allocated from the six million koku. (B) Grain Storage Method: (1) Seeds must be carefully selected to remove any foreign matter. (2) They must be baked and dried to be suitable for long-term storage, but in areas where it is not easy to dry them thoroughly, efforts should be made to dry them as much as possible, and attention should be paid to their condition. (3) Grain that meets the first and second requirements will generally be classified into three grades of standard grain. The classification of standard grain will be determined by each prefecture, and prices will be differentiated according to variety. (4) For storage methods, mixed storage should be used as much as possible, but the degree of dryness of the grain, local customs, and other circumstances should be considered when selecting bag packaging or bulk stacking. When packaging is used, hemp bags or straw bags should be used. (5) Grain should be handled by weight, and the weight should exclude packaging material, and efforts should be made to unify it as much as possible.</p>
<p>According to the survey conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the number of rice harvests for this year (Showa 8, i.e., 1933) increased by 5,573,332 koku compared to the previous year, and also increased by 5,495,094 koku compared to the previous five years, approximately at 66 million koku.</p>
<p>Showa 3 (1928): 60,303,089</p>
<p>Showa 4 (1929): 59,557,694</p>
<p>Showa 5 (1930): 66,875,535</p>
<p>Showa 6 (1931): 55,215,263</p>
<p>Showa 7 (1932): 60,390,098</p>
<p>Five-year average: 60,468,336</p>
<p>Since the harvest number of rice storage is fixed, this number is used to calculate the supply and demand situation in Showa 9 (next year), and during the lean season, the remaining rice should be more than 16 million koku, so there is a concern that this year's rice is in surplus. On the one hand, there is a desire to purchase to maintain the grain price. Although the official price has been drafted, it is still difficult to be appropriate. The key is still the amount of rice production costs. According to the survey conducted by the Kurashiki City Agricultural Association, the production costs of rice are as follows: (A) Revenue: 3 koku of brown rice is 66 yuan, 1.8 sho of broken rice, 140 kan (approximately 980 catties in our country) of rice straw is 3.36 yuan, 140 catties of rice husk is 0.3 yuan, and secondary income is 4.46 yuan, totaling 70.47 yuan. (B) Expenditure: Direct production cost is 27.35 yuan, including 3 sho of seed cost is 0.39 yuan, fertilizer is 7.16 yuan, labor cost is 15.3 people is 16.8 yuan, various material costs are approximately 1 yuan, livestock cost is 2 yuan, indirect production cost is 37.68 yuan, including agricultural tool cost is 2.3 yuan, building cost is 1.25 yuan, various taxes are 4.66 yuan, and land capital interest is 29.46 yuan, totaling 65.03 yuan. The income and expenditure offset each other, with a surplus of 5.4 yuan, that is, the actual production cost of 1 koku is 21.68 yuan, and the selling price of 1 koku is 25.49 yuan, but according to the provisional minimum price of 22.7 yuan, there is only a profit of 1.2 yuan. Also, according to the calculation of the Agricultural Association, among 860 farm households, the production cost per koku, excluding 82 households with less than 18 yuan and more than 33 yuan, the production cost of the other 778 households is 4.48 yuan for direct production cost and 3.32 yuan for indirect production cost, totaling 7.8 yuan, which is 25.21 yuan per koku. Therefore, the Rice Control Committee decided on the official price as follows: (1) The standard maximum price is 30.5 yuan. (2) The standard minimum price is 23.3 yuan. However, the Imperial Agricultural Association and the political parties were quite dissatisfied. The Seiyukai's intention was to advocate that the minimum price should be raised to 25 yuan. The Agricultural Association believed that the minimum rice price, the production cost per koku for self-cultivating farmers was 23.73 yuan, plus transportation and miscellaneous expenses of 1.48 yuan, should be above 25.21 yuan, so it must be raised to this number or above. Afterwards, it was finally passed according to the original plan. In the beginning of the implementation of the control, farmers were all watching and waiting, and almost no one dared to sell. When the second harvest volume was announced, it was 270,000 koku more than the first time (65,963,000 koku), the price index gradually declined again, and the government's seasonal purchases were delayed, coupled with the pressure of new rice, the rice price gradually showed a downward trend. This is because the harvest in the Japanese mainland has been 65,963,000 koku, the import of rice from Taiwan and Korea is 13 million koku, plus the current inventory of 9.07 million koku, totaling 87,970,000 koku. By the time of the lean season next year, after deducting the consumption of 71,540,000 koku (calculated based on a population of 66,860,000 and a per capita annual consumption of 1.06 koku per day), the surplus is more than 10 million koku. Therefore, since the Rice Control Committee resolved to increase the provisional price by 0.6 yuan, requests for the sale of rice to the government have suddenly increased everywhere. It is heard that from December 20 to 21, it reached 826,615 bags, that is, 330,000 koku, and farmers were deeply afraid that they would not be able to maintain the price of 23 yuan, and those who sold rushed to it. It is estimated that since the implementation of the control, the total number of applications has reached 1.33 million koku, resulting in the government's inability to cope. In addition, at the end of last year, farmers were eager to obtain money, and the amount of sales increased even more. According to past practice, the average monthly sales at the end of each year are around 100,000 koku. Since the promulgation of the statistics law, the rice price has been weakening day by day, and farmers are generally pessimistic, so the request to sell is even more difficult to prevent. Other things, such as the import of Korean rice into Japan, are also more than in previous years. In Showa 7 (1932), the import of Korean rice was 7,503,000 koku, and this year it increased by approximately 300,000 koku, and the Tokyo market has already fallen from 24 yuan to 23.75 yuan. Last November, the highest price was 24.97 yuan, and in less than a month, it suddenly plummeted by 1.23 yuan. It is estimated that the request to sell rice at the end of March will be less than 2 million koku. However, the Japanese government has neither unlimited funds nor warehouse facilities. Therefore, in order to maintain the control law and relieve rural areas, the government had to reluctantly cope. This is still in regard to the situation at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Japan strictly implements rice control, which has been discussed by the Rice Committee members and approved by the Advisory Conference. It stipulates that the Japanese mainland store 6 million koku, Korea store 3 million koku, and Taiwan store 1 million koku, and there are funds to provide financing. Interest during the storage period and transportation costs of storage warehouses are given incentive money, and free storage is also available. 1,450 storage warehouses are built throughout the country. The construction of storage warehouses initially adopted urban concentration, with 60 large warehouses with a storage capacity of 100,000 koku being built in each prefecture throughout the country. Later, after referring to opinions from various aspects, the storage incentive plan was submitted to the Advisory Conference, and a combination of centralized and decentralized approaches was used. Ten warehouses with a storage capacity of 100,000 koku were built in central metropolitan areas, 40 warehouses with a storage capacity of 50,000 koku were built in small and medium-sized cities, and 1,400 small warehouses with a storage capacity of between 1,000 and 5,000 koku were built in villages and towns throughout the country. These warehouses are all built by the government. Farmers' grain should all be entrusted to government storage warehouses for safekeeping. The government believes that if farmers themselves use industrial associations or grain storage associations to build small-scale warehouses in rural villages and manage them autonomously, it will not be completely appropriate. It is better to have the government operate them, which can be more unified. However, its biggest drawback is that the grain cannot be sold unless it rises to 15% above the standard minimum price. If there is no opportunity to sell it by the end of the rice year, the government has no choice but to compensate the storers for the cost of damage and deterioration, thus increasing the burden on the national treasury. Moreover, all the stored grain is managed by the government, not by the farmers themselves, which hinders the spirit of rural autonomy. Therefore, the Japanese Seiyukai advocates that the grain storage system should refer to the old rural storage system (charitable granaries), and organize grain storage associations in villages and tribes in the spirit of mutual assistance between neighbors, so as to have the functions of famine relief and supply regulation; at the same time, it can be divided into mandatory storage and voluntary storage, and the development of a farmer-autonomous storage system can also be expected. This was ultimately opposed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the original plan was still implemented. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Ministry of Finance halved the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and on the other hand, there were different treatments in terms of the interests of landlords, self-cultivating farmers, and tenants from the standpoint of grain storage. As a result, accusations arose. According to the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo on January 13, the amount of rice sold by farm households throughout the country has reached 3.8 million koku. If it reaches the end of the old lunar year, there will be 200,000 to 300,000 koku of sales every day. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry expects that it will have to increase to 8 million koku within this year's rice year. However, the remaining funds of the special account for rice supply and demand regulation are 420 million yuan, and the maximum amount of purchases per year is only 6 million koku. Therefore, in light of the current situation, it has reached the amount for two years. The effectiveness of the control law is almost in a state of danger. Moreover, the minimum price of rice still cannot be maintained in principle, and the government's financial damage is becoming more and more exhausted. When the Japanese parliament convened this year, the members immediately questioned whether there were any countermeasures to improve the situation. And the rice harvest in Japan again exceeded expectations, reaching a huge amount of 70 million koku, and the rice price was in a situation where it could not be maintained, and the government also felt that the rice finances could not cope with this situation. Since the parliament has questioned it, if no other compensation is planned, the political parties will inevitably propose rural rice countermeasures separately, forcing the government to implement them. Therefore, Agriculture Minister Goto and Prime Minister Saito discussed the results and decided to propose new countermeasures: (1) increase the operating funds of the rice department to cope with farmers' sales; (2) effectively manage rice in the two colonies of Korea and Taiwan; (3) amend the current rice control law; (4) decide to take an overseas dumping policy, and first transport more than 10 million koku of the remaining rice of more than 10 million koku to the Yangtze River area and various commercial ports in North China to sell at reduced prices, and the losses will be compensated by the government. In addition, the Taiwan government will transport 500,000 koku of its Penglai rice to various important commercial ports in Guangdong and Fujian provinces for dumping, and the losses will be shared by Taiwanese farmers and the Taiwan government. As for the implementation methods of the aforementioned items (2) and (3), it seems to have been confirmed by the Tokyo telecommunications of the China United News Agency on February 4. Farmers in Taiwan and Korea, as people of a subjugated country, are bound to be sacrificed everywhere. In the end, they are the meat on the chopping board of the Japanese people, and our Chinese farmers, because the country is weak and has no resistance, also suffer the misfortune of the pond fish and suffer the harm of Japanese rice dumping. Isn't it very sad! The China United News Agency telecommunications are attached below.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has decided to sacrifice the people of the two colonies of Taiwan and Korea for the benefit of the landlords and tenants of Japan because rice harvests have made life extremely difficult for landlords and tenants. It is very determined to change its rice policy, then listen to the demands of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties to amend the Rice Control Law. Its purpose is to prevent the transportation of rice from the two colonies of Taiwan and Korea to Japan, and compete with Japanese rice, causing the market price of Japanese rice to fall, in order to maintain the market price of Japanese rice, that is, to maintain the official price and avoid farmers from shaking. The colonial rice management issue is being discussed by the Ministries of Agriculture and Colonial Affairs and the governments of the two colonies. However, the two governments still disagree with the demands of the home country because they fear increasing the resistance of the ruled people, and strive for management methods to reduce the degree of sacrifice. However, Agriculture Minister Goto firmly represents the interests of the ruling nation, and decided to submit the colonial rice management plan and the rice amendment plan to the cabinet meeting on the 6th, to have the cabinet meeting pass them, and then force the governments of the two colonies to recognize them. It is heard that the Agriculture Minister's countermeasures are: (1) colonial rice will be managed by the government, (2) colonial areas will reduce rice production and promote the conversion to miscellaneous grains, (3) colonial rice export permit system, (4) colonial areas will implement special rice, etc. It is said that one of the four plans will be implemented.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned countermeasures have not yet been submitted to the parliament due to Agriculture Minister Goto's illness, they will not be implemented immediately. However, the Japanese government has always had a strategy of avoiding names and seeking substance, or even implementing the results of the cabinet meeting first to avoid people's ears and eyes. The Japanese rice harvest has become a fact (including Taiwan and Korea), and the disaster of a bumper harvest is also a unanimous view of the Japanese government and the public. If the Japanese government wants to protect the livelihood of Japanese farmers, it has no choice but to accept the remaining rice, or the rice that is temporarily trapped by financial resources and cannot be stored, according to the aforementioned method. After acceptance: if those who come are not refused, the financial resources will inevitably be exhausted at times, and if they are refused, the farmers' riot will arise, and the government is in danger of collapse, so the only way is to dump overseas in order to vent. Looking around the world, the most convenient country for dumping is China. Although China is said to have cheap rice, is its cause a bumper harvest! Is it due to uneven regulation! Is it due to the poverty of the people! This is quite complicated, and I am afraid it is not as simple as the cause of cheap Japanese rice. Moreover, Japan has concessions in China to hide it, and the navy to cover it. If dumping merchants have losses, the government has resolved to compensate them, so dumping in China is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>According to the current rice price, if it is impossible for Japanese rice to be sold in China, it is because the losses are too great, but what about the price of Taiwanese rice? As for the saying that Japanese rice dumping is Japanese counter-propaganda, using "exit" as "entry," it is no different from a fool talking in his sleep, wanting to cover it up. Unless Japanese rice cancels its dumping method, it will ultimately target China. It will inevitably pay attention to South China first, and Fujian in South China is more convenient than Guangdong. Fujian is adjacent to Taiwan, and Taiwanese rice has always been used by the people of Fujian Province to make up for it. The second is Guangdong. In the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), Japanese rice came to Shanghai for dumping, but was blocked by the people of Shanghai, and turned to Hong Kong to enter Guangdong. The next best choice is Tianjin, but Tianjin has tariffs, and competition is more difficult. The Yangtze River area is a rice-producing area, and there is originally no need for sales, but if the rice price rises to more than ten yuan, Taiwanese rice may already be among the local rice. At present, the only helpless countermeasure is to urge the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to levy tariffs on imported foreign rice in accordance with the customs tariff regulations, which may slightly reduce its momentum, but I am still afraid that it will not be fully effective.</p>
<h3>Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Ordinary Checks and Limited-Amount Checks</h3>
<p>— Pan Hengqin</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of limited-amount checks, I have repeatedly written articles for publication in newspapers, forgetting my own shallowness. This type of check can directly avoid the evils of bounced checks and altered checks, and indirectly has the possibility of promoting the circulation of negotiable instruments. Although it cannot be said to be a perfect solution, it is still worth studying and promoting at a time when the circulation of negotiable instruments is not widespread and social fraud abounds. Some contemporary scholars believe that limited-amount checks, if the limited amount is too high, it is still difficult to avoid alteration; and it is believed that it is only suitable for small-amount depositors. In my opinion, although it is still difficult to avoid the evils of alteration if the limited amount is too high, it is still slightly better than those without a limited amount. It seems that we should not give up eating for fear of choking. As for the promotion of limited-amount checks, although it was initiated for depositors with weak credit, the actual application does not necessarily have to be limited to depositors with weak credit. Even commercial transactions are not necessarily unsuitable. However, the principle can be that depositors voluntarily use them. However, the mentality of depositors when issuing checks is that they all hope that their checks will be trusted by others and easy to circulate; as for the mentality of the payee, they all hope that the checks they receive are indeed reliable. Those who can have this effect, except for those who deal with large banks, limited-amount checks are almost equipped with it. Limited-amount checks are issued to depositors by the bank according to the deposit amount, which actually contains a guarantee nature. The wider the circulation, the more convenient the transaction. In other words, the number of returned checks is less between the issuer and recipient of limited-amount checks, while the number of returned checks is more between the issuer and recipient of ordinary checks. Even if the procedure for issuing limited-amount checks may be slightly more cumbersome than issuing ordinary checks, merchants value credit most, and procedures are secondary. If issuing a check can enhance the credit of the negotiable instrument, even if it requires slightly more procedures, it should not be declined. The fact that ordinary checks have a stamp with the words "Please exchange for a promissory note" is one example. Moreover, whether the procedure is convenient or not is a relative rather than an absolute matter, and it is completely a matter of habit. After it has been implemented for a long time, it will no longer be a problem. The key is for the bank to be good at adapting to the circumstances. Now, I will list and analyze the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of ordinary checks and limited-amount checks below for research.</p>
<p>Ordinary Check　　　　　　　　Limited-Amount Check</p>
<p>Issuer Advantage Freedom to fill in the amount　　 (1) The payee is more at ease and welcomes the receipt because this type of check has a guarantee nature. (2) Not easy to be altered.</p>
<p>Disadvantage (1) The payee is afraid of bounced checks and may not welcome it. (2) Easy to be altered. Limited amount can be filled in.</p>
<p>Person</p>
<p>Bank Advantage Simple procedure for issuing checks to depositors. No mistaken payment of bounced or altered checks.</p>
<p>Disadvantage Prevent mistaken payment of bounced or altered checks. The procedure for issuing checks to depositors is more cumbersome.</p>
<p>Recipient Advantage In addition to the issuer's seal being inconsistent or lost, there is no risk of bounced or altered checks.</p>
<p>Disadvantage In addition to the issuer's seal being inconsistent or lost, there is also a risk of bounced or altered checks.</p>
<p>Person</p>
<p>The above-mentioned advantages and disadvantages are clear. Furthermore, ordinary checks can be reported as lost if they are lost due to fire, theft, or loss, but limited-amount checks, because they circulate for a longer period of time, are more beneficial to the issuer in terms of interest than ordinary checks before they are exchanged at the bank.</p>

(28) Contract Tax Fine: A fine of one to three times the contract price is imposed, approximately $25 annually. (29) Brokerage Tax Educational Donation Surtax: $10 per license, with an annual revenue of $300. (30) Slaughter Surtax for Educational Donation: $0.10 per head, with an annual revenue of $1,000. (31) Official Intermediary Donation: $3 per year for each person in each small district to obtain a license, totaling $180 annually, used for financial expenses. (32) Cattle Broker Donation: $50 per year in multiple villages, $40 in average villages, and $30 in abundant villages to obtain a license, totaling $120 annually, used for financial expenses.

<p>In addition, there are many temporary apportionments in each village, such as the cook donation, courier post fee, Baojia donation, etc., with numerous items, amounting to nearly three dollars or more per household per month.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Overall, from the above counties, we can see the heavy burden of donations and taxes in rural areas. Analyzing it, we can obtain the following phenomena:</p>
<p>(1) Numerous items: As listed, each county can have more than forty types.</p>
<p>(2) Many surtaxes: Almost every tax has a surtax, and the types of surtaxes are extremely complex.</p>
<p>(3) Many miscellaneous taxes: The so-called gentry and wealthy donations, Baojia donations, etc., have particularly increased in recent years.</p>
<p>(4) Many collecting agencies: For example, in Luotian, there are always four or five or more collecting agencies.</p>
<p>(5) Much embezzlement: Many taxes, many collecting agencies, then there must be much embezzlement, especially miscellaneous taxes and temporary apportionments, which are indeed opportunities for local bullies to make money.</p>
<p>(6) Much consumption: And very little is used for production, even charity and public welfare expenses are rare, mostly for government and security expenses.</p>
<p>Since donations and taxes in rural areas are so heavy, the high-sounding talk of rural recovery is really too far off. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to the lack.</p>

<h3>Securities: The First Week After the Holiday Saw Many New Highs in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Market prices were at their peak, and a reaction gradually emerged at the weekend.</p>
<p>In the week of February 19th to 24th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced the first week of trading in the national bond market after the Lunar New Year holiday. Following a long nine-day break, the situation stabilized and sentiment was firm. The market opened on a bullish note on the 19th. Due to the New Year, only half-day trading sessions were held each morning, with two transactions. The atmosphere was generally cheerful, with more buying than selling. With only four days left in the February futures, the short sellers were somewhat panicked. The market price rose sharply, and the bullish opening became a natural trend. Most bond prices reached new highs. The best-performing bond was the Disbandment Bond, which surged by more than one dollar, reaching a high of $69.85, breaking the previous high of $69.20 on July 19, 1933. On Tuesday, both long and short positions wrestled with each other, and the market price stabilized, with highs and lows alternating. On Wednesday, the short squeeze continued, with the long positions holding firm and the market price rising by another two or three jiao. Thursday was the last day of February, and except for the Disbandment Bond, which eased by about three jiao due to the long positions rolling over, the remaining bonds continued to rise by three to seven jiao. On Friday, only the March contract was traded, and the initial rally remained strong. Most bonds, up to the Salt Tax Bond, reached new highs, marking one of the highest market levels of the year. Most had already surpassed the highest records of the previous year. However, due to the frantic selling of the Short-Term Gold Bond on the 4th and 20th, it alone turned downward. With sentiment slightly weakened, it immediately showed signs of weakness. On Saturday, rumors spread, and many long positions were liquidated. The Disbandment Bond 19 was sold off significantly, falling by more than one dollar, while other bonds also fell by a small amount. As a result of the week's market performance, the February contracts rose by several jiao to $1.78, while the March contracts rose by only one or two jiao to half a dollar. Due to the high market levels, a reversal was likely. Rumors were insignificant, and the future was not expected to see major changes. The total trading volume for the week was $73,182,000, including $22,000 in spot trading and $73,160,000 in futures trading. The highs, lows, rises, and falls are compared below. (Unit: Dollar, Trading Unit: Hundred Dollars). Starting tomorrow, full-day trading with four sessions will resume, and the April futures will also be added.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: American Cotton Seems to Have a Rebound Tendency</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market was mixed, with concerns of a rebound. It initially strengthened due to buying by traders, but later weakened due to the weakness of Wall Street. As a result, the spot price remained unchanged, while the futures price fell by one to seven points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by four points, and futures prices fell by three to four points. The Bombay cotton market initially strengthened due to short covering, but later changed due to profit-taking, resulting in a weakening. As a result, the Pingar remained unchanged, the Omra fell by 1 rupee and 7.5 annas, and the White Karachi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (telegram of the 24th):</p>

<h3>Grains: Various Local Thick Japonica Rice Down by 5 Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of various local types is scarce, with a total of over twenty numbers (over 3,000 stones). The market situation is still weak, and there has been no improvement due to rain and snow. It is because the Hakka merchants are indifferent and have no intention of purchasing, making the situation even quieter. There are few merchants on the market, and sellers have no way to force the situation, so they have to keep the goods and wait for an opportunity. The outbound volume from this street is about 500 to 600 stones. Therefore, the prices of Changbang, Sutongbang, Nangang, and other japonica rice, as well as Du Yangjian, etc., have been reduced by 5 cents. As for the Hakka merchants, such as those from Tianjin, they initially seemed to have the intention to purchase, but unexpectedly, the subsequent market went in the opposite direction, and it all came to nothing. Only the Nanyang and Xiamen merchants took in one load of Sijing goods and one load of Qingpu late rice, about two to three hundred bags. As for Fenglian goods, there was only sporadic activity, making it difficult for the late rice market to improve. The price of dark glutinous rice has also weakened due to sluggish outbound traffic.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Sugar and Local Refined White Sugar Down by 10 Cents Each</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, such as the number 24 coarse sand white sugar, was still priced at $19.70 by the Public Association, number 89 Dutch red sugar was $15.75, down by 10 cents. Taikoo Sugar B Mark remained at $20.115. The local factory's refined white sugar fell by another 10 cents, to $18.80. Numbers 2, 3, and 4 each lost 20 cents, and few transactions were made. The fixed-number market continued to open, with over 300 bags of lower-grade Longjiang Qing priced at $13.05, and the next grade at $10.025. The outlook for the market is promising.</p>
<h3>Hardware: The Association of Companies Opened 800 Boxes of Iron</h3>
<p>The trading of iron from the Association of Companies was very prosperous yesterday. In total, 800 boxes were opened in the city, with a price of $28.50 per box, slightly down by 50 cents compared to the bullish opening. However, overseas prices have soared, and the local inventory is running low, so sentiment is still good. It is feared that the market will not fall again in the future.</p>

<h3>New Books Sold by the Pound</h3>
<p>— Wen Li</p>
<p>A certain bookstore in Shanghai is selling at a great discount, new books are sold at one dollar for three and a half pounds, regardless of the content value of the new books, good or bad, works by famous writers or unknown writers, they are bundled together and priced according to the weight of the paper, just like selling fish and vegetables in the small vegetable market, priced by the pound. This news is already thought-provoking enough. A certain bookstore gave the newly published literary books to its peers for five yuan per dan before the New Year, and the peers bought them and said it was because of the face of their boss. The downturn in the new book industry, along with the value of culture and academics, has plummeted! Alas!</p>
<p>The publication of a new book first goes through the writer's exhaustive efforts, thinking and planning, and then writing it out. Secondly, the typesetting and printing workers have to print it out several times with trouble. The human effort alone is considerable, even if the new book has no value, it should not be sold by the pound according to the weight of the paper. Moreover, some paper prices are more than three and a half pounds worth one dollar, or one dan worth five dollars, this new book market price really gives the writers a feeling of swallowing cold air.</p>
<p>Literary people, except for those who help the rulers, those who make a living by selling articles are regarded by the society as literary beggars. Although they think they are noble, their social status is inferior and inferior. Now, the new books of literary people are sold by the pound, losing both fame and profit. Alas, the end of literary people has arrived!</p>
<p>Articles have never been valuable since ancient times. Poetry is called "carving insects and small skills", and novels are referred to as "street talk and alley discussions". Therefore, ancient people used aliases and pen names when writing books. Now, writers are raising their voices, but in this highly commodified modern society, the impact of the market downturn means that writers' works will inevitably encounter the fate of being worthless. It is no wonder that the poet Zhu Xiang committed suicide by drowning.</p>
<p>New books are sold by the pound, and I dare to predict that from now on there will be many writers who follow in Zhu Xiang's footsteps. Economic pressure is already enough to take people's lives, not to mention that the real social environment gives people unlimited depression and pain in spirit?</p>
<h3>I Think of Him</h3>
<p>— Boer</p>
<p>I remember that before I met him, I unintentionally offended him. A friend, T, invited me to Xinguang [Theater], and since T was also his friend, we unexpectedly ended up watching a movie together in the same theater. The movie that day was a martial arts film, without much meaning, but there was a very fierce lion, or perhaps a leopard, in it. When we came out of the theater, T confidently asked me to guess, saying:</p>
<p>"Do you know if it's a lion or a leopard?" I replied that it was a leopard. He said I was completely wrong, that it was just a lioness whose appearance was similar to a leopard. I insisted, "Fool! Isn't it obviously a leopard?" T was even more unconvinced and had to find a third party to prove it. The third party was that Mr. Meng, who, like T, said it was a lion. This really infuriated me, and I quickly interjected, "He's a fool too!" Because he didn't know me, he didn't say anything even though I had called him a fool for no reason. I didn't think that such an ordinary sentence would offend him. In fact, when I call people fools, it's not out of malice or contempt. Sometimes, I even like to call someone I adore a fool. After Mr. Meng and I became acquainted, I didn't think of him as a fool, and in fact, he wasn't. But I called him a fool several times. Once, he was very unhappy and about to get angry because I called him that. I said to him, "You're not a fool to begin with, but now you really are. Just because I call you that, does it mean you'll really become a fool? Really a fool!"</p>
<p>Mr. Meng originally didn't want to get to know me. One day, he heard people say that where I lived was not good, and the landlord was a bad person, causing me a lot of inconvenience. He wanted to persuade me to move. Because of this, he had to come to my place to meet me. That's how he and I became acquainted and started talking. Judging from this, his motivation for getting to know me can be said to be very simple.</p>
<p>After that, it was not surprising that we would meet, but a certain barrier between men and women was unavoidable. This wasn't due to feudal thinking; I myself found it strange. I interacted with quite a few men, and he had countless girlfriends. I usually didn't feel awkward with friends. I could say whatever I wanted, even my own difficult situations. I wasn't afraid of others knowing. Sometimes, I only had one copper coin left in my pocket, but if I needed to see a friend, I would casually borrow ten cents from them. I didn't like to hide things, be hypocritical, or pretend to be rich. But with Mr. Meng, I couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>As time went on, our feelings for each other were quite good. I didn't need to hide anything from him, but I saw him as a rich man and didn't want to receive his help, so I didn't want him to know that I was down on my luck. But one time, he asked to eat at my house. He wanted to see if the dishes I cooked myself were delicious. Logically, this was a very ordinary thing, but because I didn't have chairs or a table at home, it would be inconvenient to entertain guests, so I couldn't agree to him. But this small request, due to my insistence on refusing, aroused his curiosity. He impolitely waited in my room. As a result, lunch was not ready until 2 p.m. With no other choice, I would rather treat him to a meal outside. This was how we solved a lunch problem, and at the same time, he observed many things about my life that he had never known before. Later, he hoped to understand me more and came up with a plan: he asked to eat at my house every day. He said he had been very poor recently and didn't have money to eat at restaurants. This unbelievable statement really troubled me. The problem wasn't about chairs and tables, but about not having money to buy groceries and rice. This time, I couldn't hide it anymore, and I couldn't find any more money to treat him to meals. Forget it! I could be open about everything. At that time, he took out the only bill in his pocket and asked the landlord's servant to exchange it for small change. Unfortunately, she came back and said, "Sir, the bill can't be used!" How sad we were when we received the bill!</p>
<p>In our friendship, it couldn't help but naturally become closer day by day. He understood me, sympathized with me, and my difficulties swirled in his mind. He sincerely thought of several ways to arrange my life. At the same time, he told me he was leaving Shanghai, and the time was very hurried. After this news reached my ears, although the material needs could be temporarily solved, I suffered a great spiritual trauma. My heart suddenly became cold, and my eyes seemed numb.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and he decided on the date of his departure. He told me he would take a car to my place and then go to the ship together. But that day, I waited until 1:45 p.m. and still didn't see him. The ship was scheduled to depart at 3 p.m. I assumed he was too sad and deliberately didn't come to say goodbye. If I had waited patiently, I thought I would never see him again. So, I hurriedly called a rickshaw and drove straight to the dock. Coincidentally, he had just arrived, but it was already late. After his luggage was placed in the cabin, he held my hand and sent me back to the dock. In half a minute, we had to let go of each other's hands. His heart was probably very anxious, and he quickly gave me a farewell kiss on the lips, then flew onto the ship. We parted so hurriedly. I stood at the dock, waiting for his ship to disappear from my sight. I returned home with heavy, monotonous steps. I still remembered him in my heart. Silence! I was very afraid! …</p>
<h3>Kindness and Insidiousness</h3>
<p>— Where to Go</p>
<p>Someone once said that the kindest animals are the most terrible.</p>
<p>For example, cats. When it's curled up at your feet, its green, glowing pupils narrowed to a slit, and you run your hand over its soft, "Persian rug"-like fur, you'll definitely feel that this animal is truly very gentle, and you can definitely get a most intimate feeling of tenderness from your fingertips. However, you never consider that this small thing has a very poisonous beastly heart and the sharpest claws. And these claws will suddenly extend when you're gently caressing it with goodwill, grabbing your hand and sinking deep into the flesh, causing you to bleed immediately.</p>
<p>Likewise, generally speaking, the treacherous politicians or imperialists in history, none of them lacks this gentle appearance. Originally, a gentle appearance is most suitable for concealing a treacherous intention. Because man-eating tigers and wolves can sometimes be as kind as a "grandmother," and the most poisonous flowers are exceptionally beautiful. However, this kindness is a means of eating people, and the beauty of the flower is a way to entice people to approach it.</p>
<p>As we straightforward people see it, man-eating tigers and wolves should openly show that they are man-eating tigers and wolves, and treacherous politicians should show that they are treacherous. This is greater than those people whose outward appearance is merciful but whose hearts are insidious. For example, Zhang Zuolin was said to be a bandit and frankly admitted that he was a bandit. From a historical perspective, this is greater and more likable than hypocritical and insidious people like Wang Mang. Because this is a display of the most candid human nature, and the thoroughness of this display is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we are with a murderer and a silent monk, listening to the murderer's eloquent speech, hearing him tell all about his motive for killing and everything he felt in his heart, we feel that such a person is not only not scary, but rather very likable. On the contrary, the silent monk, who only faces you with his serene demeanor, occasionally showing a smile that is definitely not genuine, we easily feel that these people are mysterious, and it is easiest to breed suspicion. Therefore, inevitably, we become wary of such people.</p>
<p>And this is a kind of human candor and a kind of human insidiousness.</p>
<p>People who don't hide their state of mind at all are easier to deal with than those who are silent and hide things deeply. The latter is exactly the opposite. Perhaps it's precisely because they are difficult to be dealt with and difficult to be understood that those insidious and treacherous people make their outward appearance exceptionally kind, but their bellies are full of ghosts.</p>
<h3>Bad Luck</h3>
<p>— Cun</p>
<p>People in the Jiangzhe area have a common saying, "Touching bad luck." When people encounter bad luck, it's never a good thing. I've had so many unlucky things happen to me this year that I can't even remember them all. Today, I encountered it again, and the more I think about it, the more depressed I feel.</p>
<p>Jingwen had asked me to contact a certain editor about something several times, but I always forgot. Today, when I went to Jingwen's place, he brought it up again and said, "Why haven't you contacted him yet?" I was in a good mood, so I called him. That Mr. [Editor], though we weren't exactly close acquaintances, but we had met a few times and even hung out together at the dance hall. Therefore, when I called him, I thought that if I just said what I wanted to say, I could succeed. Unexpectedly, I spoke to him on the phone very happily and politely, but he said in an arrogant tone, "Wait until I connect with Jingwen!" This sentence was already disrespectful, but unexpectedly, he hung up the phone immediately after saying that, without even waiting for me to say another word, or even saying goodbye. This snub really shocked me, I had never encountered such a snub before. When I mentioned it to Jingwen, he pondered for a moment and said, "I forgot to tell you, a few days ago, Lu Shan called and said that some tabloid fabricated rumors saying that she and he were getting married. She said I wrote it. I said I never read tabloids and didn't have that kind of free time. She said if it wasn't me, then it was old Cun who wrote it. I said old Cun doesn't do this kind of thing, I don't have that kind of friend. Today, he probably gave you a snub because of this!" I really touched bad luck, people are blaming me for other people's business. I was incredibly angry at the time, and I immediately wanted to reason with them, but Jingwen stopped me and said, "Wait for me to call Lu Shan, why are you in such a hurry? You fool!" I left Jingwen's place and went home, and the more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I was so polite to them, but I was repaid with ingratitude, and now they're even accusing me of publishing their news in some tabloid. It's not easy to make friends these days, and I'm running into bad luck everywhere.</p>
<h3>Smooth Sailing</h3>
<p>— Liyue</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, I went to a friend's house for a New Year's Eve dinner. In his living room, besides the usual large red-gold character candles and nandina and wintersweet flowers on the altar, there were also two large lotus roots, each more than two feet long, lying on both sides of the altar table. One of the guests pointed to the lotus roots on the table and asked the host what their purpose was. The friend explained: "This is called 'smooth sailing,' and it means hoping that everything will be smooth and accessible everywhere next year, and that you can make money everywhere."</p>
<p>Smooth sailing. If you use the Shanghai dialect, that's "be able to turn around".</p>
<p>Someone said: "In Shanghai, not having money doesn't matter. As long as you can turn around, you can start a business and build a market."</p>
<p>Those who owe hundreds or thousands of dollars are often beaten until their heads are broken and bleeding. Suppose you owe hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, you are instead carefree, sitting in a car, living in a Western-style house, and the food goes without saying, what is it if not delicacies from land and sea? Let me ask you, where do they get so much money? Of course, they have their own magical powers. If you ask again what this skill is? Let me tell you, this is called being able to turn around, which is smooth sailing.</p>
<p>There are also merchants who traffic in contraband and evade national taxes. No matter how strict the national laws are or how heavy the penalties are, they have clever ways to escape the law. In other respects, boycotting enemy goods, no matter how tight social opinion is, judging from customs import statistics, enemy goods have greatly increased. It can be seen that there are still people doing it on a large scale. And still making a fortune. Of course, their various methods and secrets cannot be done without being able to turn around.</p>
<p>In short. If you can turn around smoothly, no matter what aspect, you can get a lot of face and take a lot of advantage.</p>
<p>Smooth sailing, smooth sailing, Chinese society is circling in smooth sailing.</p>

<h3>Answers to Several Legal Questions (2)</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young man who graduated from junior high school and has also studied commerce for several years. Now I want to support myself and plan to open a small department store. The store's staff is also being recruited in the newspaper. But I don't know if I need to register if I open this kind of store in the concession, and which agency I should register with? What about in Zhabei? Are there any books I can refer to? I heard from a friend that when opening a store, there are often gangsters who unreasonably demand drinking money, etc. I think you are our guiding teacher, so you won't leave this unanswered, right?</p>
<p>Respectfully wish you, Mr.</p>
<p>Good health!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Lu Lun</p>
<p>Editor's note: When opening a store, whether in the concession or in the Chinese area, you can apply for registration with the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Regarding registration procedures, you can purchase and read the book "General Rules for Merchants" from the bookstore for reference. If there are gangsters who take the opportunity to demand from newly opened stores, you can immediately call the police and have them dealt with.</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My friend met a girlfriend. After repeated visits, the two gradually fell in love. It is said that during their passionate period of love, in addition to sweet kisses, they also engaged in physical intimacy such as semi-naked embraces (of course, he took the initiative). But afterwards, he was blamed by her, saying that he had insulted her and wanted him to find a way to make amends. If they went a step further and got married from then on, it would have been a very beautiful thing, but my friend has been married since he was a child. Although the relationship is not good, he already has children, and he cannot abandon them in principle. Therefore, the two of them have been discussing this without a good solution. Now I want to ask you for him!</p>
<p>(1) If she and his she and both families can agree to marry her as a second wife according to local custom (this custom is said to be common in Guangdong, and it seems to exist in other places as well, that is, one man marries two women, both of whom are called wives, without distinguishing between the principal and secondary wife), can this be permitted by law?</p>
<p>(2) In law and morality, is the crime of destroying virginity only established when sexual intercourse has been completed?</p>
<p>(3) If the above question is true, then how is the completion and non-completion of sexual intercourse distinguished? Please answer the above three questions publicly in the amateur mailbox!</p>

<h3>Husband and Wife (8)</h3>
<p>— Yu Mei</p>
<p>She listened to the sound of footsteps walking out, and listened to the sound of the big door closing tightly. She returned to silence, only hearing a little human voice in the distance. She put a piece of opium on the pipe and squatted on the fire bucket. She bowed her head into a semi-sleeping daze, not knowing how much time had passed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the big door rang again. She woke up with a start, her heart jumping a little. She asked,</p>
<p>"Who's coming in?" She faced the outside of the room.</p>
<p>"It's me." The answer contained an element of laughter and emotion.</p>
<p>"Slowly, I'll light your way." She nimbly stepped out of the fire bucket and took the lamp out of the room. The man was already outside the door. She smiled at the man who came and asked, "What time is it?"</p>
<p>"It's almost midnight." The man who came said, lying down on the left side of the opium couch.</p>
<p>This man was a little older than her, in his late thirties. A mediocre face of a high-ranking official showed a smile, and the white wool of the leather robe was exposed from the places that had never covered his calves. He had done a day of tedious and important things, and he brought a light heart like a kite. The kite was placed in the clouds, and Third Miss was the spring cloud surrounding this kite.</p>
<p>Chunyun poured tea for the kite, and grasped one of his hands with both hands, asking why he came late and made her wait for a long time.</p>
<p>"There are many things every day. These two days have been particularly busy. The store wants to check the goods, and I have to find things for others." The man said, bringing his mouth to Chunyun's lips. After a long time, Chunyun leaned against the other party.</p>
<p>"This day is going to exhaust people." Chunyun looked at his face with glittering eyes.</p>
<p>"I ran errands for Huang Xiaoliuzi in the morning, and I ran to him again until just now, and I finally got a clue."</p>
<p>"Is Huang Xiaoliuzi going to talk about something? That thing is extremely rogue."</p>
<p>"Last year, I arranged for him to work at Tongtai," his mouth held the mouth of the opium pipe that had been attached with a piece of opium, and his cheeks puffed up and down as he smoked. Immediately, two gray smoke came out of his nostrils first.</p>
<p>Chunyun interjected, "Didn't Tongtai close down?"</p>
<p>He nodded, and after finishing a mouthful, he groaned a sip of tea before continuing, "Yes, it's closed. Now I have to talk to someone else."</p>
<p>"Wasn't the business of the Tongtai family very good last year?"</p>
<p>"The people inside are all very good. But Shanghai was at war last year, and money couldn't circulate everywhere, so there was a financial turnover problem."</p>
<p>"The business on the street is still good. How could it lose money?"</p>
<p>"The business on the street is not good either. Business is getting worse every year. You naturally don't see it clearly on the outside."</p>
<p>"Then, think of a way, can't you close the store?"</p>
<p>The man laughed at these interesting words. He burned the opium in his hand and said, "Things aren't that easy there. Business is not good, and nothing can be turned around on the outside, so it's over. Recently, goods are expensive, and people in the countryside don't buy goods either."</p>
<p>"Why don't people in the countryside buy goods?" Chunyun looked at him again, happy in her heart.</p>
<p>"It's really strange, now everyone's business is smaller than before. Goods simply can't be sold."</p>
<p>"There are always a few that make money, right? Can they all be this bad?"</p>
<p>"Naturally there are some. Like the kerosene manager, the cigarette manager, the foreign sugar manager, as long as it's managing foreign goods, they always make money. But the daily foreign goods business is not necessarily making money. The years are getting worse year by year."</p>
<p>"I remember it didn't seem like I heard about it being so difficult to find a job a few years ago. It seems like it was more lively then than it is now. I don't know if it's because of luck? Or is it a calamity?"</p>

<h3>Valuation of Major Hollywood Stars at the Beginning of the New Year (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Xi Fu</p>
<p>Starting from the beginning of 1933</p>
<p>How prices rise and fall throughout the year</p>
<p>Only in his case, Wallace's little friend, Jackie Cooper, has fallen quite a bit. The fiery reputation he caused in the Skippy films has now waned a lot... Jackie is gradually growing up after all. But fortunately, since the release of "The Bowery", Jackie's market value, whether he is an adult or a child, has resurfaced with an upward trend. Jackie – he is a genius after all.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford, although she is undoubtedly a great actress, most of the critics who were consulted unanimously said that she has lost a lot of her brilliance in 1933, the reason being that she almost didn't get a script suitable for her status throughout the year. Fortunately, like Jackie Cooper, a new film, "Dancing Lady", came out, and the drop in her stock market value was immediately stopped.</p>
<p>Marion Davies and Ramon Novarro were able to maintain their original positions throughout the year. Although the stock market of the film industry is extremely turbulent, these two deeply respected stars have never fallen behind. Novarro has a deeply rooted influence in Spanish-speaking countries; that is his unique advantage, and he can rely on it for many more years without failing. In addition, Marie Dressler also maintained her baseline in the past year, but you need to know what kind of baseline her baseline is! She is the most beloved figure on the screen.</p>
<p>If we take the past year as a standard, then John Gilbert has become a thing of the past. But now he cannot be ignored again, because he has co-starred with the Swedish superstar Greta Garbo in Queen Christina. That film is said to be very successful. Therefore, his personal status can also be maintained from now on. As for Greta Garbo herself, that goes without saying. Anyone who leaves the screen for a year will definitely be eliminated, but Garbo? She is a mysterious woman, and the movie fans under her command are not just movie fans, they are simply crazy and follow her closely, never letting go!</p>
<p>Clark Gable's price in the stock market has dropped somewhat, but strangely, he is considered more valuable by the film company than before. 1933 was Gable's third year of widespread worship on the screen. The sensation when he first appeared on the screen has of course subsided a lot now, but he has released good films one after another, and he seems to have dug a very deep trench, which can make money for the company for many years without failing.</p>
<p>The one whose price dropped the most in the past year was Robert Montgomery. He needs divine help to restore his former glory; otherwise, he needs to release good films one after another, like "When Ladies Meet". Norma Shear has been away from the screen for too long, so her status has certainly been affected. Helen Hayes's price has neither risen nor fallen. Lee Tracy has improved a lot. But the most significant rise is Jean Harlow. She is quite likely to compete with Joan Crawford. If Joan doesn't take care of herself, her position will be taken by Jean. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Third Party's Impartial Discussion on "The Good Earth"</h3>
<p>— Shen Yu</p>
<p>Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" caused quite a sensation in European and American literary circles and has also garnered much attention in China. Not long ago, someone wanted to adapt it into a screenplay, preparing to make a movie, but it did not succeed. Recently, there has been news that an American film company is sending people to China to film "The Good Earth." Consequently, Mr. Cao Yunxiang published an article in this publication explaining why "The Good Earth" should be filmed. This sparked a reaction from Mr. Luo Yang of Every Day Movie, to which Mr. Cao responded in a film special issue. Although I saw the previous two articles, I don't remember them clearly. Here, I want to take a third-party stance and say a few words based on "The Good Earth" novel and Mr. Cao's recent article.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Cao's writing, the first point of contention between Mr. Cao and Mr. Luo Yang is whether the protagonist Wang Lung's "feudal" consciousness should be portrayed.</p>
<p>Regarding this question, my opinion is as follows: In Chinese rural villages, feudal remnants are powerful. "Confucius's teachings" and "divine retribution" deeply envelop all farmers. Therefore, when using the Chinese countryside as a theme, depicting their feudal consciousness is inevitable and truthful. However, we must understand that because of the total collapse of the rural economy, this superstructure also wavers. Farmers, driven by hunger, bravely break through these "feudal" "remnants" and move forward. Only by breaking through these "feudal" "remnants" can there be a path to the future. Therefore, the most outstanding writers, in truly portraying the Chinese countryside, should first adopt a critical attitude when depicting "feudal remnants," indicating their gradual collapse. But is "The Good Earth" like this? Not at all. Pearl S. Buck is a religious believer; she simply praises these "feudal remnants." Needless to say, she is maintaining these "feudal remnants" rather than destroying them.</p>
<p>The second point is whether exposing the dark side of the Chinese countryside is malicious propaganda.</p>
<p>We believe that the idea of "not airing dirty linen in public" is incorrect. We should correctly expose all dark sides, especially the exploitation by local tyrants and landlords, the brutality of feudal warlords, and especially the aggression of imperialism. It is not enough to only depict superficial issues like opium and bandits. Therefore, we do not oppose "The Good Earth's" depiction of the dark side of the Chinese countryside, but we feel that what "The Good Earth" portrays is not the main evil. As for China's "natural disasters," in a word, they are all "man-made disasters." Before man-made disasters are alleviated, there is no way to avoid China's natural disasters. The dumping of foreign goods, the continuation of civil war, the heavy taxes, and the exploitation by local bullies are causing the farmers' last drop of blood to be drained. What strength do they have left to repair waterways and plant trees? Pearl S. Buck spent a lot of time in the Chinese countryside; couldn't she see these reasons? She saw them but deliberately didn't mention them. That is why Pearl S. Buck is Pearl S. Buck.</p>
<p>In short, "The Good Earth" is not a progressive novel. Although Pearl S. Buck's attitude is not like that of other "God's chosen people" who see the Chinese people as "semi-civilized" or "deserving of hardship," we see none of the heroic posture of Chinese farmers in "The Good Earth."</p>
<p>"Work hard, don't complain, God is the fairest." Perhaps Chinese farmers are the "children" in Pearl S. Buck's ideal? Unfortunately, they have become unruly.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Watching "Twin Sisters"</h3>
<p>— Jin Long</p>
<p>This is truly a miracle of the 1934 silver screen. The appropriate editing, perfect sound recording, and flexible direction all surpass Star Motion Picture Company's previous productions. Hu Die's success is even more unexpected to us. The acting is vivid and meticulous, and every line of dialogue touches the audience's heartstrings, exciting their emotions.</p>
<p>The director's use of techniques on the screen is also successful.</p>
<p>However, there seem to be some shortcomings in terms of makeup and set design, such as Zhao's mother appearing too old, which does not match her character's identity in the play, and the military law office for detaining prisoners being too luxurious.</p>
<p>The most satisfying aspect is the reduction of subtitles, with most of the plot conveyed through concise and moving dialogue, which is satisfactory.</p>
<p>The actors are all successful, and the most praiseworthy and successful, of course, is Hu Die. Her subtle expressions greatly enhance the film's achievements. Xuan Jinglin is also not bad. Tan Zhiyuan's performance in the later scenes is too contrived and over the top, which is typical of him.</p>
<p>In the barren Chinese film industry, the discovery of such a progressive work makes us believe that Mr. Zheng's directed films will not disappoint.</p>
<h3>"The Return to Ordinariness"</h3>
<p>— Lü Yi</p>
<p>"The Return" has broken the record for domestic films. That's correct. Why? Is it because its ideology is more correct than all other domestic films? No! Is it because the director surpasses all other domestic films? Also no! Are the actors or cinematography superior to all other domestic films? Still no! Then why do we say that "The Return" is setting a new record in the Chinese film industry? The answer is: because it used a foreign woman in a joint performance. It is wrong for us to praise and evaluate it simply because it used a foreign woman in a joint performance, because the merits of a film depend on the completeness of its content and form, and can never be determined by the actors' nationality.</p>
<p>Some people say that the good box office performance of "The Return" is entirely due to the appeal of Niki Tyna and a "kiss," which I think is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Rather than saying that "The Return" is a tragedy, it is better to say that "The Return" is a sound drama. No matter how painful and bitter the facts are, the ending is always happy.</p>
<p>The theme of "The Return," to put it in fashionable terms, is not necessarily realistic. Then, why did the author create this foreign love triangle story out of thin air? To deliberately show novelty? But "The Return" is far less flavorful than "Life." If "Life" is a cup of black tea, then "The Return" is like a glass of plain water. The plot of "Life" can stir people's emotions and give people lessons, but "The Return" only tells people an ordinary story. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Emil Jannings's "Merry Monarch" to be Released</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Universal Film Company has brought many excellent films to Shanghai audiences, such as "The Merry Widow," "Spring River Flows East," "Woman," "Forbidden Paradise," and "The Magician," which have all shocked the Chinese film industry and received excellent reviews. Now, they have another film, "Merry Monarch," to be screened at the Grand Shanghai Cinema.</p>
<p>This film is adapted from the famous work of the great French writer Pierre Louÿs, and the one left over is prepared for leap years. This story, on the surface, fully depicts the king's extravagant and sensual life, but in its essence, it opposes polygamy.</p>
<p>The world-renowned actor Emil Jannings plays the protagonist King Pusa in this film. The female lead is Shirley Vert, who is famous on the Hollywood film scene. The production cost of this film is nearly 18 million francs, most of which was shot in southern France, and a small part was set against the backdrop of ancient castles in Austria. Almost all the beauties of Paris were gathered, and it was also dubbed in both English and French. The copy with English dialogue will be screened at the Grand Shanghai Cinema.

<h3>"The Angry Tide of the China Sea" Performed</h3>
<p>On the 28th in Beijing</p>
<p>"The Angry Tide of the China Sea," produced by Yi Hua Film Company, directed by Yue Feng, starring Yuan Meiyun, Cha Ruilong, Wang Yin, and Qin Tong, which has been completed after a considerable period of production, has been approved by the Nanjing Inspection Committee.</p>
<p>The theme of this film takes the fishing village as the background and promotes the national spirit as the main focus. The ideology is indeed commendable, and the actors' expressions, the director's techniques, and the camera work and editing have all achieved great success. It has been determined that this film will be performed at the Beijing Grand Theater on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Queen Christina XVI</h3>
<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>The next morning, Christina sat on the throne, with ministers and representatives of the people standing below. She stood up and announced her will to the public. Everyone listened, looked at each other in surprise, and then burst into a loud chorus of "No, no!" It turned out that what the queen announced was that she had decided to abdicate in favor of Prince Charles. Prime Minister Oxenstierna cried out in exasperation, "Your Majesty, you can't!" Christina raised her hand to first stop the uproar, and then said to the Prime Minister, "Oxenstierna, please take my crown off." Oxenstierna shouted, "I can't. I swore before your late father that I would always keep the crown on your head. I can't participate in this. I don't think any of the ministers in court dare to do this." Christina slowly said, "Then I can only take it off myself." After she finished speaking, she silently placed the scepter she held in her hand on the case in front of her, then raised her hand to take off the crown herself and placed it next to the scepter. She then untied the belt of her robe, letting it fall, revealing a white dress inside. She stood in front of the crowd and gave them her farewell. She said, "You don't need to be afraid for me. I am at peace. From now on, I will no longer be ruled by fate. No matter what I encounter, I will always be happy. God bless you. Goodbye. Above me, only God has authority." After she finished speaking, she walked step by step, without looking back, towards the palace gate.</p>
<p>In the port of Danzig, there was a ship moored there, already rigged and ready to sail. Christina took a few attendants and walked there. The captain rushed forward and bowed, saying, "Although Your Majesty has given up your throne, Your Majesty is still Your Majesty." Christina quickly asked, "Where is Antonio?" The captain said, "Your Majesty, he's on the ship," but the sadness in his voice made her heart feel a pang of sorrow. She quickly walked onto the ship from the gangplank, looking for Antonio on the deck. A person ran over from the front, but it was not Antonio, but Magnus. Their eyes met. Christina asked, "Where is Antonio?" She felt another pang of sorrow, because her eyes had already caught sight of something that looked like a coffin, covered with silk cloth. Magnus pointed to the thing and said, "He's inside." Christina said, "He's |in| there." She was flustered, like a prisoner awaiting judgment.</p>
<p>Magnus took a step forward and shouted, "That was a fair duel, and he insisted on it. It was either him or me. I won... though it was an unfortunate victory, because you would have spared me." Christina said, "Magnus, you leave this ship." Magnus said bitterly, "I'm glad I beat him. I knew he and I were irreconcilable." Christina urged again, "Magnus, you leave this ship." Magnus walked away. She immediately knelt beside the coffin and shouted, "Antonio!" She uncovered the silk cloth covering the corpse, silently grieved for a while, then covered it again, sobbing, "Antonio! Antonio! Antonio, whom I call a hundred times and he doesn't respond! Antonio, to whom I have declared my love a thousand times! I'll say it again now, I love you... I love you... forever and ever..." She stood up and called her old servant Olaf, telling him to order the captain to set sail immediately. Olaf said with tears streaming down his face, "Won't Your Majesty wait a moment longer?" Christina said, "No waiting, tell him to set sail." She stood beside the coffin, facing the boundless sea. The ship slowly sailed out, towards where the sun sets. (The End)</p>
