<h3 id="c30">英美表示後之日本態度 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>日本自四月十七日非正式聲明後。引起世界輿論之反響。及各國政府之嚴切注意。本報亦巳屢次剖晰其内幕。並說明我國民最低限度之立塲矣日本鑑於正義之不可抺煞。乃令其駐外各大公使。對各該國政府。爲該項聲明之諒解運動。迨英國政府覺察日本此種聲明。含有重大威脅意義。起而向日質問。並有聯合美國共同主張重申九國公約與門戶關放之意。於是廣田遂有第二聲明。謂四月十七日之非正式聲明「並未正式存在」以敷衍英國而英國巳認爲滿意。最近美政府對日之正式公文發表。日本雖視爲不啻重申史汀生宣言。然亦以爲在不再刺美國狀態下可得美國默契而不必答覆。故廣田認此次對華政策之聲明。巳得英美兩國政府之諒解。並巳收穫極大之效果質言之。彼於此後。將擱置英美於不問。而一意積極對華。固甚明顯者也。</p>
<p>不特此也。日人之欲貫澈其大陸政策。始終未稍改變如此次日本之非正式聲明。就表面觀察。似甚拙劣。旣惹起世界輿論之非難復挑動我國民之反感。致使遠東國際關係。更見惡化。於日本自身。亦頗不利。殊不知日本口倡和平。貎託親善。實則凖備其十年一戰之國策。到處傳播戰爭之因素。惟欲逞其武力。必先從事於其地理上之便利。尤必先明瞭各方面之情勢。故此四月十七日之非正式聲明。實内藏狡黠之陰謀。藉以窺察列强之眞意與實力探測我國民之趨向。以爲實際侵略行動之凖備。如九一八事變所謂旣成事實之造作。迄今血跡猶新。吾人於此。固應有更進一步之痛切覺悟也。</p>
<p>未以我國家實力如此薄弱。國民經濟如此破敗。苟不先謀充分之安内。與適當之培養。則對外終屬無力而且落空。然而時至今日。人之謀我。竟使我無喘息週轉之餘地。加以國内情勢之複雜。絕不易以單純方法或短少時期完。成我種種基礎工作。蓋當今中國。巳入於非常緊急時期。欲圖暫時之小康以尋常按步就班之方法以求速效。勢不可得。是故打開難局之方法惟有整一民族運動戰綫。喚起全國民衆共赴國家之急難。抗禦外來之橫暴。德意志與意大利之往事。非如是耶。土爾其之更生運動。我國人不可借鑑耶空倡　外高調。漫無實際凖備。人以飛機巨砲。我憑熱血微軀結果徒遭失敗。固不可也。爲國家社會求出路。爲民族求生存。固不應僅恃一時之情感衝動。惟吾人今日所遭遇之危機。爲歐洲各國近代所稀有。較德意志受凡爾賽和約之束縛。尤有甚焉。一舉一動。輒受外力牽制。則吾國將如何以擺脫此束縛耶。如欲求諒於外交。則國際間之形勢巳如此。觀於廣田最近應付英美之質問與其對華方針之表示。巳可明瞭其用意。蓋日本之實際行動一切仍操諸軍部之手。外交活動。僅爲其國際交際上一種技術工作。故吾人於此。自當注意其實際内容。而不宜認其烟幕作用卽爲眞相矧我國此緊急情實之下。巳萬無苟且偷安之可能。且無從容爭論是非之餘地我全國國民而苟尙以民族生存爲念者。其將如何奮發有爲。謀整個民族之統一。以爲外交之後盾耶。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）今晨民主黨參議員路易斯、在參院發表演說稱、美國全堅持其在華之條約權利、爲美國民意之一致主張云、路易斯爲外交委員會委員、其演說繼稱、駐日大使葛魯奉國務總理赫爾訓令、答覆日外相廣田之宣言、拒絕日本之亞洲門羅主義、此卽美國全體人民之公言、非僅黨政府一官員之私方、日本之態度或可使英國滿意、但此未可即認爲美國亦滿意也、吾人不欲任何軍事的或個人的衝突、然欲避免衝突、惟有維護吾人之權利而後可云、（二日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）日外務省之對華政策聲明問題、旣以廣田外相於一日向中外宣布日本方針、巳告一段落、不料美國赫爾長官三十日在華盛頓發表之聲明内容、經日外務省詳細檢討之結果、尙有不滿之點、外務省首腦頗重視此事、連日恊議日政府應否發表公式聲明書、或以其他有効形式闡明日本立塲問題、然據目下情形、外務省内部大體有如次意見、頗爲有力、外務省十七日發表之非公式聲明、一時成爲世界輿論中心、然日政府請美國駐日大使葛魯向其本國政府傳達日政府之見解、廣田外相又於一日會見英美兩大使、明示日本對華方針、英美兩國政府亦諒解日本眞意、於是本問題似巳告一段落、美政府於二十六日命葛魯大使傳達日政府之覺書、不過片面的表示美政府之見解、並未要求日政府之答覆、且美政府之見解、日本亦無異議、故不必一一與之反駁、日本依照旣定方針、與中國共同維持東亞和平則可也、（三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相對於四月十七日之聲明、尤注力緩和美國空氣、然赫爾國務院長於三十日所發聲明、與諸英外相西門對下院之答辯比較、美國似尙别有存意、據外交界息、廣田外相殊感其對美平和外交、雖迭次派遣親善使節、又曾使齋籐大使提議美日不侵犯條約之締結、此議雖尙未獲得美方贊成、但去年來之對美平和政策、實有相當收成、在十七日之聲明前、關於滿洲及不侵犯條約問題、美當局實正待日方提出具體案、如對美國十分有利、卽有予以愼重考慮之凖備、然廣田巳失此機、而爲軍部操縱、發出其獨霸東亞政策、破壞其對美和平外交、被美當局窺知其係爲軍閥式之外交、故此后美當局對日方之提議、當將置之如耳邊風、廣田外相此後對美外交工作、極難期待有效果、且十七日與二十日兩次之所謂非公式聲明、實由天羽情報都長發出、天羽與松岡洋右同樣、素被公認爲軍部派之外交官、美方亦有鑑於此事實、故其對日外交、在此依屬軍閥政府存在之際、其否認僞國及其他政策、確難在短時間内有所變更云、（三日華聯社電）</p>

<p>德意志的失業問題、在社會民主黨當權時代、就是一個大問題、兩年以前、世界上就有經濟聯盟的朕兆、德國貨向外輸出、就有了低减的傾向、那時候救濟失業的方法、是靠政府支出救濟金·或失業保險、然而政府并不是本身有什麽點金術、其收入的方法、還是要靠公債·靠租稅·來支付、一旦產業衰頽、金融停滯、海外輸出减少、加以債務的緊逼、不得不使德國失業者日漸增加、經濟差不多走上絕路了、</p>
<p>希特勒取得政權的當時、（去年一月）、失業人數約在六百萬以上、經希特勒政府拼命努力的結果、到去年秋季、曾减少到二百二十五萬人、但這裏面、包含着季節關係、所以自去年冬季以至於本年年初、失業人數又復升到三百七十萬人左右了、現在希特勒政府、依然以這件事情爲工作的對象、他想今年夏季以後、要减少失業人數到二百萬人以下、</p>
<p>其减低失業運動的方法、約可分作兩種類、一種是態度比較正經、其事業也比較</p>
<p>是有恒久性的、其他一種、在工作的時候、雖然也是會聚精神、但總覺着有幾分喜劇性質、而且時間性非常短促、頗不易繼續、</p>
<p>屬於第一種類的方法、第一·是修築汽車路、德國計劃着這兩三年當中、要成爲歐洲第一個汽車國、政府預計要築成六千公里的汽路車綱、這種路都是用柏油鋪面、建築得相當的講究、在過去一年中、曾經建築成功的、有一千五百公里、不過這種道路、在實際的生產上、有多大的作用、在减輕德國當前的經濟恐慌、有多在的效力、却不能不說是個欵問了、其次是開闢荒地、不過這個開闢荒地的辦法、比衆不同、這是海岸的塡築事業與澤沼地的灌漑工事、在海邊上很遠的地方、築起堤防、將堤防範圍内的海水、排逐出去、借此獲得適宜於耕作的土地、這在北海沿岸、如富利斯蘭·卽巳着手進行了、將澤沼不毛之地、施以適當的灌漑、使其變成肥沃之區、在漢洛瓦附近、巳經着手實行、這兩種工程、都很浩大、不但需要巨大的欵項、而且需要無量數的人工、這固然不是得短時期内所能見效的事業、同時德國的失業問題、也不是短期内可以圓滿解决的、</p>
<p>其次、是臨時救濟、去年冬季到今年三月結束的第一次「冬季救濟運動」所募集的金錢、總計起來、有三萬萬二千萬馬克由此也可以看出國社黨員　頇的太甚、「突撃隊」遍佈在各處街頭巷尾擱路勸捐、甚至一出門口、就會遇見勸捐的隊員、如有遇見他們而不肯出捐、或逃避回家的、就會蒙受非愛國的惡名、因此有許多人竟躱藏在家裏、不敢輕於出門、還有所謂「一碟星期日」就是在那個星期日的午餐、每人祗能吃一碟菜、過後由國社黨員出來、每一家戶口收五十個分尼、在各家酒菜館裏、也祇許吃一碟菜、但收雙倍的價錢、集聚起來之後、由該酒菜館主人捐出　、據說柏林市「一碟星期日」的總收入、計有四十萬馬克、再有一個趣事、是限制婦女勞動、甚至禁止夫婦二人都共同有工作、這種意思、大約是以倫理方面、要婦女回到良妻賢母的路上去爲主體、不過减少失業的經濟意味、也是有的、并且拼命的獎勵結婚、凡是新婚的人組織家庭、可以長期的低利息、由政府借到一千馬克、今年財政部預算、有二十五萬組結婚、并預備得有這樣多的結婚基金、借給他們、又凡生三個小孩的人、得免除其償還借欵、再則國社黨員在街上賣插在胸前的製花、麻紗徽章·玻璃徽章·的也到處都是、這同是救濟失業的一種手段、</p>

<p>「中國新文學運動史</p>
<p>資料一讀後的疑問</p>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>我讀了光明書局出版黃若英編的「中國新文學運動史資料」以後，不禁發生了如下的疑問，茲特提出來，務請先生們能公開給我一個詳確的回答。</p>
<p>第一，「五四運動」在文學上到底成就了些什麽？在本書内，自第一編到第六編，差不多全是「五四運動」前後關於新文學與舊文學論戰的史料。在這些史料中，我們看到這時所謂新文學運動，其實是一種白話文運動，一切論戰，都是從文字使用的論點出發。這運的本身，是否有缺陷，固不能不使人懐疑，（因爲在我想新文學與舊文學之差别，總該不單在文字一）而在牠的成就上，雖然胡適先生在「文學革命運動」一文襄，指出了幾個要點；「第一，白話詩可以算是上了成功的路了，···第二，短篇小說也漸漸的成立了。」但我却仍不敢深信，如果胡先生的所謂「成功」，是指的「之乎者也」換了「的麽呢嗎」，那到不管，倘不然、文學作品的成功，還應該看牠的内容，還應該看牠對於讀者的感受力，那我可以說，五四時代製造出來的能够給我們看的作品，除了呐喊徬徨外，實在少而又少，　如，徐志摩的詩吧，無論文壇上怎樣稱他是詩聖，對於我們是没有什麽相干的。卽退一步，單就白話文而論，他們遺留下的，也仍是些看不懂的全歐化句子，或者改組的小脚般　的新式古文。試問現在是否言文一致了呢？現在究有許多爲大衆所能够看得懂的文學出版物呢？</p>
<p>第二，本書第五編是關於整理國故問題的史料。整理國故，當然並不是絕對不可以的，因爲文學的發展也程社會的發展一樣，有其必然的史的發展過程。醫如現在的蘇聯文壇，便提出了接受文學遺產的問題。但我以爲這問題只限於新文學巳經打好牠的强固的基礎時，才好提出。在我國，在五四後不久，新文學運動並不能說如何的展開，如上面所說的，連白話文運動，也没有完成它的初步任務，如果這時就掉轉馬頭，鑽進牛角尖裏法，專來什麽『紅樓夢考證』，這不是明明在拾重就輕，明明放棄了他們當前的主要使命，明明是對於他們自己的反叛：不久前在文學某期上有人照樣提出接受遺產的問題，試問我們的文學遺產在那裏？</p>
<p>第三，中國的新文學運動，到現在還一直在進展着，這是毫無疑問的。但是我要問的，是有些人提出「恢復五四精神」的口號，這口號是不是正確呢？目前的文學運動與五四時代有什麽相同之點呢？在以前文學月報上曾載有宋陽先生的一篇「大衆文藝的問題」，内面提了出了「用什麽話寫」這一節目，他主張創造新的大衆自巳的白話文，（不是五四式的白話）但是怎樣去創造呢？這是不是繼承「五四」在文學上未完成的白話文運動呢？</p>
<p>此外，當然還有許多問題，如文學研究會和前期創造社在當時是扮演怎樣的角色？牠們同是新文學運動的主力，爲什麽會對立起來？在同一時期，爲什麽會有兩種不同的文藝思潮興起－－因爲據說文學研究會是代表自然主義的，而創造社爲代表浪漫主義？這些均是我們所迫切要知到的，但是如果限於篇幅的話，那就請先生先回答上面特别提出的三點。</p>

<p>（三）</p>
<p>— 陳東白記</p>
<p>第二、新生活運動的知的研究　新生活的方式雖是衣食住行要整潔簡樸、但目的是要達到義康恥的、因此一般人以爲要實行新生活、非先知禮義廉恥不可、能知禮義廉恥、然後才能實行新生活、此種說法、到處皆然、故新生活運動生以後、一般人講究禮義廉恥的特别多、但我以爲新生活雖要達到禮義廉恥之目的、但禮義廉恥離不掉衣食住行的生活、故祇要衣食住行的生活有規律、就可在衣食住行中表現出禮義恥來、並非在衣食住行之外、另外做到禮義廉恥、</p>
<p>禮義廉恥是抽衆的哲理、古時很多人在講究着、但衆論紛紜、各有說法、至今尙無最後的定論可見禮義廉恥的原理、是不容易明瞭的、管子說第「禮義廉恥、國之四維、四維不張、國乃減亡管子雖然這樣提倡禮義廉恥、但他自巳曾不曾懂得呢、論語上說、「邦君樹塞門、管氏亦林塞門、邦君爲兩君之好有反坫、管氏亦有反坫、管仲而知禮執不知禮、」可見管仲一個禮字、先没有明瞭、史記管仲傳說、管仲召忽、俱事公子糾、旋公子糾被桓公所殺、召忽死而、管仲不死、非但不死並且臣事齊桓公、試聞管仲知義不知義呢、管仲嘗與鮑叔賈、分財利多自與、試聞管仲守廉不守廉呢、管仲嘗三戰三北而不死、這樣管仲知恥不知恥呢、依上說來、禮義廉恥、連管仲自己亦不懂得、不必說其他的人、故我們不必在禮義又廉恥的原理上去研究、因爲知是難的呀、孔子云、「民可使由之、不可使知之、」又云、「知之者不如好之者、好之者不如樂之者、」這就是說我們不必明白了才去做、中山先生也說過、「知難」求知固然要緊、但是要先知先覺者負責、否則必至於「知」永不能得「行」永無其期了、中國目前一切事都想「知而後行、」雖然也有意思、但總不能呌人人都如此、所以我們對於新生活、不必一定要「知而後行」就是不必去研究禮義廉恥之原理、祗要承認禮義廉恥是好的道德、而切實遵照着新生活公約去做就是了、</p>
<p>第三、新生活運動的行研的究、新生活完全是國民生活的方式、祗要一國國民有一定的軌律的生活方式、這就是國家的目的、中國古代講禮義廉恥、重行而不重知、在上者以身作則、示以軌範壞、普通社便皆能身體力行、社會很有秩序、至今一般無知愚民、鄉村婦女、他們在待人接物之時、還有此種禮義廉恥的行動表現、實在他們巳完全成爲一種習慣、故很自然的流露出來、若在知的方面他們何嘗明白什麽禮義廉恥的道理、由此可見新生活運動全不是知的問題、而是行的問題、祗要照新生活公約去做就可表現禮義廉恥的精神、中山先生說、　不知亦能行」就是要糾正中國人那種一定要知而後行的毛病、所以我們今後對於生活運動、不必推求其高深的理論、祇要切實地去做、</p>
<p>第四、結論　根據上面知行兩方面的說明、歸納起來、就可得到一個結論、就是新生活運動是行的問題、而不是知的問題、不必求其知、但在求其行、不問我們知不知、但由我們行不行、與其欲先知而後行、還不如因行以得知、（完）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>所以，這個局長的位置，對於孟福祥是絕對不配的。他簡直是一個元全無用的傀儡。讀者請注意下面，就可以相信了。因爲太后急着要知道一些關於火車的學識，便派人去把孟福祥召了來；他一來，當然是先恭恭敬敬的磕了頭，磕罷頭，雖然站了起來，却不敢抬頭，眼晴老是看着地板上，靜候太后詢問。</p>
<p>「究竟是什麽東西使這輛火車行動的呢」？太后的第一個問題。</p>
<p>「回太后···回老佛爺」，孟福祥是有口吃病的，因此他的說話是很慢，而且斷斷續續地不能連貫的。「就是車上這些工役們把火車開動的！」</p>
<p>「這還怕咱不知道嗎！現在，只要問你，他們究竟是怎樣</p>
<p>把火車開動的」？</p>
<p>「奴才該死！奴···奴才不知道！奴才不知道！奴才不···不···不敢妄回」！</p>
<p>「記得在前一站的時候」，他的答復雖然是這樣的令人失望，可是太后偏要問他。「爲着一件什麽事情，我們的車子，曾經往後面退過，你現在就告訴我，何以這些車輪旣能望前面滾呢」？</p>
<p>「奴···奴···才知···知···知道！回太后！這是那司機的人弄的」！</p>
<p>「那未，他們又是怎樣把這個車子停下來的呢」？「回太后！六個人從車上跳下來，奔到最後的那節車子裏去，抓住了那個輪盤，只要他們盡力的抓住，這個車子就停下來了」！</p>
<p>這個答復，也許比較孟福祥他自己所想的倒來得凖確一些；因爲他自己總以爲那些司閘夫一定是硬生生地把這列車拉住的。（二五）</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>到郊外去一望，在壟畝間，燦，燦然作金黃色的花朶，而且開得密密地，像畫着方罫一般；倘然在上空駕着飛機，俛瞰下界，你别說那個渾圓的地球，是混濁黑暗的修羅塲。實在在反變了黃金世界，映到它的眼裏去；又有小小的花像蝴蠂，在那春風披拂的當兒，宛然一動一動的飛逐着，尤其是顏色白裏間紫，而紫裏有很大的黑點，故遠望眞若無數的蝴蝶，聚集在萋萋碧草間；這兩種花不是野生，而是田間的農作物。　　第一種：就是油菜的花，相傳其種得自塞外，出產的地方，名呌『雲臺戍』所以這一種花，也有呼『蕓薹花』的，那花瓣作十字形，蕊雌一雄六，雄蕊的底，還有一個綠色小球，科學家稱它蜜腺，時時在分泌甜汁；所以許多蜜蜂不</p>
<p>斷的穿來穿去，和油菜花萬分的親密，像結不解緣的樣子：這種菜農人在冬間下種，到了春天擷食其臺，俗呼『菜劍，』亦可作虀，入甕藏之，上海也有名它爲『臺心菜』的，其實就是油菜；他的種子，并可榨油，做餅餌不可少的輔佐品。</p>
<p>第二種：就是寒豆的花开在去歲八月裏，巳經要十種子：直到今歲養蠶時節，方纔開了花，故結的　實，竟呌它爲『蠶豆，』他的莖像稜，莢長而闊，豆扁且大，可半寸許，至堅老時候，那顏色變綠，而頭上有黑灣，若蛾眉狀，所以有人說：『蠶豆』一個名詞，就因此而來：此物可蔬食，亦可作醬，銷路極廣，如其收穫豐盈，農人競呼之曰『小熟，』從前滬人楊萬里詩：有云。『翠莢中排淺碧珠，甘欺崖密軟欺酥，沙瓶新熟西湖水，漆　分嘗曉露腴，味與櫻梅三益友，名因蠶繭一絲絢，老夫農團方兼學，譜入詩中當稼書，』這一首詩，就是咏蠶豆極工妙的作品。</p>

<p>可似以自己和他以往的交情說，又不忍調個位子，或者走開。因心裏那分焦急，都烘托到臉上，由腮上紅起，直紅到耳朶根後去。可是積之依然不曾感覺，只管不住的向這邊探這香氣的來源。最後，還是讓他把這香氣探出來了，原來是那條毛繩圍巾上的。因爲那圍巾有小半截拖到自己懐裏來，所以那上面沾染的殘脂剩粉，有氣味向上薰着。他不看戲，閉着眼晴，當是老内行在那裏聽戲，而實在他是在那裏玩味那香的滋味。人說是軟玉温香抱滿懐，這不過是形容之詞。可是以現在的情形而論，眞個是温香抱滿懐了。我相趙自强那種武人，他如何解得···「甘二爺，怎麽着？你聽入了神了嗎？」積之睜開眼來，趙翁正向他望着笑呢。積之笑道：對了，我想偷這胡琴的花腔，所以閉着眼晴，耳朶好用全力來揣摸。趙翁笑道：這樣說，二爺聽戲，是出一分兒錢，撈兩分兒本回來呢。他這句話，是指着積之又聽戲又偷胡琴說，並無别的用意。桂枝心裏，正在那裏侷促不安，聽到公這兩句話，以爲是暗裏敎訓積之，臉上更是發燒，發燒得幾乎要把眼涙流水流出來。但是越是如此，也越不敢走開，只好勉强把眼光直視着，看住戲台上。好容易把戲看完了，隨着散塲的人向外走。現在桂枝得看自由了，他故意走得快些走到母親的前面去。一路行來，都隔着積之很遠。積之和趙翁遠遠的隨着，還不住的談眘着話吧。依着趙翁還要請積之到家裏去談談，但是積之心中總不能十分平坦，就離了没有去。（三七六）</p>

<p>爛漫的艷陽烟景，過了黃梅季節，在銀絲似的雨聲中，就悄悄地飛逝了。那泥濘的耕堤上，舗滿了凌亂桃花，陰沉的濕空中，飄滿了輕盈的柳絮</p>
<p>，羅穀般的流波上，低垂着轉綠的楊絲。呃！酥人骨髓的江南的晴春，遠了去了。</p>
<p>坐在蝦鬚簾障着太陽的小齋裏，燒一支捲烟，靜靜地看着碧朗的高空，一朶落花掠過，正被燕子蹴着：同撲到簷前，於是我捲起簾子，想去捉那飄溷的春是否好現像？</p>
<p>魂，不料巳墮到水閣下面的一曲回瀾裏，給游魚呑進了腹中，重復吐出，吹入浪花，那春魂瘦得多了！</p>
<p>要是面前臨着明湖，湖外擱一座竹林，那微雨正繊繊地霏，落花也霏着：跟了絲風送停牕檽，帶一點寂寞的殘香：同時有幾四水鳥也和落花並肩的飛着，這影子，一齊投映上湖面，那眞是没有一點聲韻的音樂！</p>
<p>要是新月的淸夜，月影給風吹上了闌干，院落裏的黎花正濛濛地飄落，好像是雪片般輕盈，好像是銀雨般繁密；然而毫無令人悲傷的暗示。</p>
<p>要是釣了幾尾小魚歸來，駕一條短舲，打着槳，撥開翳滿湖上的黃昏暮靄，有落花從岸上斜吹，吹上我的烟笠，笠子爲靑竹編成，承不住他，便溜下蒼茫的水烟，像朶仙女的精魂，悠地向人媚笑。</p>
<p>落花，有着婉　的嬌姿，有着瀟洒的神韵，有着輕靈的夢幻。落花象徵了詩人和少女的憧憬。</p>

<p>— 吳曉晨</p>
<p>作者此次從平湖到</p>
<p>崇德去，乘的是</p>
<p>汽車，本來當日可以到</p>
<p>達，適巧自海寗到長安</p>
<p>的車子抛了　誤了我的行程。後來改搭汽輪，到長安的時候，巳是夜色沉沉。開崇德的接船早巳無影無踪，可是長安正在舉行盛大的花燈。此來適逢其會，所以就在長案留宿一宵。迎燈在浙西一帶本來很通行，可說是平民娛樂的一種。當局深怕影響治安，所以巳停止了十餘年。近來各地感覺商業蕭條，所以又想到迎燈或者可以振興市面。硤石海寗崇德嘉興周王廟等處將先後舉行，長安不過先開其端。長安迎燈，自十七日起，舉行四天。一共有十六臺，就是分十六組，聯合在一起迎。各有各的燈彩，各有各的特色。從晚間七時出發，要迎到二點鐘纔收燈。其中品芳臺的　塔，塔上裝滿電燈，一會兒亮，一會兒暗，最受人贊賞。還有一組七夕圖，前面配以細樂，聲調抑揚適中。尙覺動聽。其他若獅子凉亭麒龍等，連接起來，到是很長。觀衆表示歡迎的，固然極多。覺得這種燈彩太粗俗的，也不在少數。燈上還有，一種口號，可以說是表現一部份平民的思想，口號是「蠶花茂盛」「共慶昇平」「與民同樂」「四季太平」幾種。</p>
<p>各旅館和酒菜館，無不乘機抬價，大敲竹槓。本來售四角的單客房間，要抬到一元二角。小菜價格也比平常增加一倍。他們加價的理由，說是此次迎燈，各旅館和菜館担負很大的費用。所以不得不在旅客上着想。</p>

<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>風日晴和，春光爛漫，號稱天堂的蘇杭，便成了游屐集中的所在，分外覺得熱鬧了，這一次我和幾個朋友相約，作無鍚之游，預定盡一日之長，當天回蘇。約旣定，於習晨九時，同乘特别快車行，開車後，望見虎邱塔影，聳峙碧宵，一似向人送行者，漸遠漸小，饒有情致，一降田野景色，如履畫卷。不及時，鍚山央望，且見工廠烟突，密如茂林，實業之盛，可見一班了。</p>
<p>吾們因須先游梅園，乘街車至迎龍橋，復易汽車，直達園門。園在開原路西之東山，係實業家榮德生氏，就淸進士徐殿一桃園遺址所改建，廣植梅樹，故著今名。入門，卽見巨石，上刻梅園二字，路漸進，地漸高，曲折花木中，經洗心亭，登天星台，可望太湖。益上有香雪軒誦　堂，小坐，繞留月村·小羅浮，面窮山之絕，巓。山色湖光，豁朗可愛，風帆上下，尤具勝槪。便成了一詩：「梅園高處倚晴空，山色湖光一望中，最是風帆無限好，天然詩料畫難工。」</p>
<p>山半有太湖飯店，供客進餐，我們因時巳過午，卽在店中憇息，聚了一個圓桌，雖肴饌欠佳，而飯量都勝平日。飽餐後，下山出園，乘車至小箕山。山在小蓬萊之西，三面環水，夏日以荷花著稱，爲消夏勝地，惜建築多采歐化，未能免俗。遙望　頭渚，碧樹陰森，黃牆隱約，有小輪可渡，因天忽起風，波浪極大，並須繞遊　　，未及前往。又成一詩：「驅車直上小箕山，一角樓台傍水灣，遙指　頭名勝處，好風時送浪聲還。」</p>
<p>園在五里湖邊，爲鍚人王禹卿别墅，我們乘車前往，路途極遠。旣至，有千步迴廊·涵碧亭·湖上草堂·諸勝，朱欄碧檻，結構極精，石塘·雪浪·諸山，環列如屏。沿堤湖濱，柳絲播綠，花蕊舒紅，則又彷彿西子湖邊了，俯仰之間，續得一詩：「五里湖邊景色淸，　園柳暗又花明，廻廊千步峯三疊，動我悠悠物外情。」</p>

<p>— 風子</p>
<p>（三）鄉村的敎育</p>
<p>一般的說，每個人總有些獨特的　氣，或許也就是所謂個性吧！平生有絕不爲的事，有不可不爲的事，有爲否兩可的事，有於其爲彼不如爲此的事·屬於後者，我有一種很顯著的庫氣，那就是寗願聽老太婆唸彌陀經，不願與村學究談天下事。</p>
<p>天下事本來就很難談，如果與村學究談起來，則更有「說不得也」之苦。我每次回鄉，除了看看農夫的操作，以及和父老談談鄉村情形外，與此輩是絕少往來的。</p>
<p>但學究們的「嘉言懿行」，却决不因我的不相往來，而至於「淹没無聞」。</p>
<p>在我們這個村子上，稱得起是學究的，壓根兒只有半個，那就是本村學校從外縣請來的敎書先生·我所以說是半個，不僅因爲他不是村上人，而是因爲他没有學究的才氣，而有學究的論調；没有學究的高逸，而有學究的傲慢；逢宴會必據上座，一見校董，鞠躬竚立如僕役，腐酸之態可掬。敎起書來是音義糢精，連幾個小學生都應付不了。</p>
<p>但他却依舊能够敎下去。</p>
<p>這所學校里一共有七十幾個學生，敎員是二個。其他一個名雖是校長，但所管的却是村政而不是校務，他要忙着做校董的書記，村長的策士，以及紳士座上的淸客。把七十幾個年靑的學生，像托孤一樣地托給我們的學究了。</p>
<p>紳士們設辦這個學校的動機（三）風子</p>
<p>，决不是要提倡敎育，不過是替本村撑面子。說得透澈一些，也就是替自己撑面子。這倒並不是小村幾位紳士的創舉，全國君子爲着要撑面子而辦敎育事業的，不知凡幾。這種好名的行爲，本來不足深責。但迷信着二位寳貨，把兒童敎育玩忽到如此地步，實在是罪無可赦的。</p>
<p>我在附近鄉村打聽了幾處，覺得他們對於兒童敎育的隨便態度，實在使人吃驚。私塾的制度巳經過去，而主持私塾的毒物却依舊能够在新制的學校里搖　，這眞是鄉村當前一個亟應注意的問題，甚麽國家大事倒可暫時不提的。</p>

<h3 id="c314">小聰明和大智慧 <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 訥</p>
<p>凡偉大的人物，大槪對於人生，對於宇宙，有一定的見解吧。無論何等有天分的人，不經過極長久的經歷，思考，學習，是不能達到道種地步的。東西洋的學者的成就，多在中年以後，便是這緣故。</p>
<p>對於許多事有確實的觀念後，然後在人生的行程，有一定的方向。方向不是偶然碰取的，（除了買彩票外，世事大槪很少偶然。）例如賭博，其中也有一己的心意存。普通是需要確切的考察，豐富的經騐，明决的判斷。--换言之，卽需要大智戀。</p>
<p>大智慧不見得是先天的，到是從後天學習而成。而這</p>
<p>往往要經過若干的痛苦。古之求道之士，但看宋儒便知道，多少是費去何限精神的辛勤。或則從兵家走到釋家，又從釋家歸到儒家；或則不食不寢以思，終於「格」竹子未曾格通，反將自己弄病了。這種種事我們現代人看來，覺得多麽可笑，然前人費去心力，走一條路未通，退回來立在路口證明「此路不通」，倒省去後人許多力量，是仍然偉大的。</p>
<p>但小聰明則不同了。這可以說是「小有才」。小與大　殊，如松柏之與淺草，河海之於行潦；聰明與智慧不同，猶有若貎似聖人，結果爲曾子所驅；風箏可紥飛機，要坐人是不行的。</p>
<p>不幸咱們貴國的今人，相率而趨於小聰明一條路上去了。江南多讀書人，一走入小聰明的岔路上，便没有救藥。北方學者少，然小聰明的氣分是少的，產生一個學者，則是很偉大的學者。</p>
<p>聰明的趨向是伶俐，小巧，輕便，疎簡，不肯吃力·苟且偷安。這皆是破敗的原因，滅亡的先兆。試看今之人物，尤其是「文人」，那個不是憑一點點小聰明，在這兒飄來飄去？</p>

<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>五四以來，能把中國人的各種要求多量地表現出來的，是小說，而不是小　　　　「水滸傳」，「西遊記」等之社會意義，亦較「閱微草堂」等爲大，在文章的立塲上言之，小品散文十數年來固然成功，然而，是不能只就文章去論文學的。我以爲嚴肅地去寫小品散文是很好的，但是不能把小品散文看成「萬能藥」。</p>
<p>哈密爾敦的「小說論」，是包含着好多的可批判的處所，自不待言，因爲是某一個時代的產物之故。不過，能讀一遍，好過連一本書都不讀。而如果能獲到更進一步的方法論，自然更好。創作方法上的無政府主義，是不大好的。而高唱出「隨筆之小說化」的「人物」，是否讀過哈密爾敦，尚是問題。如果眞是「隨筆之小說化」是「天經地緯」的話，那</p>

<p>— 殊</p>
<p>「翰海」十二卷，沈鍚侯輯，其師陳眉公鑒定，收自周案迄明尺牘千餘通，明牘佔五之四</p>
<p>，明刋本。其編製，用分類法，别爲情，美言，自叙，交際情至，藥石，憤，逸，臥遊，文，經世，佳言等十二部，部各幾種。編選凖則，據例言，說是「牘中卑語腐語，不足煩帳下兒，信手抺去。若夫　骨冰稜，彤霞日映，令人心動者，亟收之。」不過，編選雖精，仍不免有一二缺憾，卽是不時將被選者所作遊記隨筆等等·亦作爲尺牘收入，以及作者著名不　一，如　宏道有時　袁宏，有時又署袁石公，有時又者袁中郎，此二點，我殊不能同意。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>書前有「崇禎庚午孟夏朔日」陳眉公所作序一篇，其要點，首先在指摘尺牘一項，自楊用修王世貞所輯「淸裁」出後，「便無生味。」所謂「有生味」的尺牘，當如「飛瀑懸流，亂　厓月，」「澄水帛，招凉珠，出人限未到處，」「朗朗如百間屋，」「雋語刺心，抺殺不痛不　所之句·」這些條件，「翰海」選者是具備的，所以他「遊　海而　之。」其次，他大槪感到尺牘小品之不爲世重吧，感槪的說「陶士行竹頭木屑，　爲經濟：文亦何大何小·有一段眞精神透映紙上，便是慧業。」在末段，則發洩其對時事感，謂「方今烽　欲銷，戎索自定，賦詩非策，八脚不　；吾且思漢文之一紙，賢於十萬師，漢光武之明見萬里，豈止流玩雙魚而己。」序引着筆不多，顧眉公對於尺牘之理解，對小品文之認議，以及藴藏在心中的時代苦，於此一一見之。是眉公的一篇重要文章，也是當時文運中的一篇有力的文獻，不容許我們輕輕放過。</p>
<p>麽，「一弄小品文，勝讀萬卷書」，自然會是前途樂觀，「天下太平」了。</p>
<p>徐懋庸先生在「小說與隨筆」中所述的意見，與我的所見并無什麽不同。我說散文隨筆之爲貴族或士大夫層的產物是就樣式之發生（Ｏｒｉｇｉｎ）之點而言。徐懋庸先生則是論目前的現狀。至於報告文學呢，其性質雖與隨筆，Ｆｅｎｉｌｌｅｔｏｎ之類相似，但在Ｇｅｎｒｅ上是不是同一的呢？須考慮了。兩者是不同的社會的其礎之產物。此文並非是對於徐懋庸先生所表的異議。因爲，有人對着徐懋庸先生和敝人所論，「大放厥辭」，所以又寫了此文。</p>

<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>我喜歡讀遊記，也常常對人說到旅行的好處：而事實上我郤是一個並不十分熱心遊玩的人。來到上海快兩年了，有許多似乎應當去走走的地方都没有去過。每天，從朝至夜地在都市里生活着，吸着煤烟氣，聽着機械的囂音，我終於覺得有點嫌厭了。</p>
<p>趁着晴明的春天，邀了林和玲玲，帶着一顆乾燥的心，到南市的半淞園去。汽車開到南市的時候，玲玲說：</p>
<p>「這是中國地界了。」</p>
<p>先是住在幽靜的鄉下，終而天天在租界的摩天樓下過日子的我，看見這里的石子路，矮小而年老的店鋪，就像到了一個古鎭上似地，我想背誦一首七言詩或是一首辭，可是汽車顚簸得很利害：玲玲的身子幾乎倒到我的懐裏來了。　　到達半淞園的門口，是下午二點多鐘。林把我們的票子買好，就一同穿過了大門，走在一條走廊上了。</p>
<p>我和林都没有來過；這次得讓熱路听玲玲給我們引路。我看着她苗條的身影，想到她那年輕的，無邪的心一定是很快樂的。我們相識是最近的事；因爲言語上的小小的隔膜。我並没有跟她說過很多的話。但是，剛才我是說過這樣的話了：</p>
<p>「玲玲！我想學上海話了。」</p>
<p>是的，會說上海話的時候我可以和玲玲做朋友的；我們不是像有很多的話藏在心里而說不出來嗎？</p>
<p>有不少古玩擺在這里出賣，看看價錢，並不怎樣高：只是我對於這些東西全不感到興味。我究竟是都市人，吸了煤煙味雖覺得苦，而對於山和水，郤又是陌生的啊！</p>
<p>在一條人造的河水上，划着小船；吹來一陣暖和的風，玲玲的臉上泛起微笑。水是綠色的，兩邊的蘆草也是綠色的。假山上，一位戴了瓜皮帽的遊客大聲地唱着「武家坡」；橋上，一羣女學生在折照片。</p>
<p>「我們也來一張吧。」</p>
<p>聽了林的話，玲玲跳了湖心些去了。有許多人悠閑地坐在亭子里喝茶：對於喝茶的趣味我又是不大懂得的，所以又怱怱回到河上划船去了。</p>
<p>一羣驢子喞喞地在那邊跑着，背上騎的是姨太太模樣的女人們。</p>
<p>這里邊也有賭博性質的遊戲塲，使我回憶到初來上海的第二天·在大世界所看到的也是這麽一種。林打算化一兩角錢給玲玲打點什麽，結果是什麽都得不到！</p>
<p>瞬息間，巳是日暮黃昏了。</p>
<p>古香古色的半淞園是留不住我的。正如美麗的西子湖使我覺得寂寞一樣。終於又鑽到汽車里。讓它開着六十度的速率由石子路直衝到摩天樓下來了。</p>

<p>阿發終於决定了。他無論如何要試一試。</p>
<p>像這樣的决心，他今天巳下過百十次，可是每次他摸到袋裏的錢，便把這勇氣打銷了。袋裏丁當響着的是一塊幾角錢。而這一塊幾角錢，竟有幾百種用途，每種又都是必要而且急需</p>
<p>的。</p>
<p>没法，這一些錢够什麽用？祇好什麽都不用，省得像是看輕了别種用途似的。「要是給我中了啊！那不是····？」</p>
<p>他不是傻瓜，他明白要是一下子給他撞着了，就是再添出幾百種用途都會有辦法。誰敢斷定他阿發就没有這運氣？！前天在好食來飲茶時，不是聽到人們都在說，上次的頭獎是給一個碼頭苦力中着了嗎？</p>
<p>現在是皇天居然有時也會保佑一下窮人的了。</p>
<p>他這樣一路自己和自己　解着，辯護着。巳經很快的從　殻　轉到快富街上來了。</p>
<p>他認識附近一家最大的舗票廠，呌做興隆的舗票廠。</p>
<p>兩臺地　燈，像門神似的在那家門口兩旁對峙着。</p>
<p>燈籠有兩人合抱那麽粗，一托半長，黯紅的燭火，　在油紙殻裏，像一對滿狡的眼晴在閃縮。燈籠殻上糊的是四個又組又扁，像是幾隻肥的　蟹疊在一起的紅字：國防經費。</p>
<p>阿發走到門口，遲疑了一下，立刻往前一直走過去了。要是給認識的人撞見了怎麽說？他們定會當面取笑的：你看阿發這窮光蛋，在那兒想發横了哪！哼！眞是　蝦蟆想吃天鵝肉哪！哼！不，不，自己比不得有錢的，化掉二毛錢，像是化掉一個銅子似的滿不在乎。這塊幾毛錢，得一直用到再找到工做的時候。鄉下人來城裏找工的又是那麽多，街角上隨便看一下，便是幾十個，蹲着，站着，徘徊着，在等工做，不，不，自己得省吃省用些，别再荒唐！·····</p>
<p>他直走到一定好大茶樓。三層樓上起了一陣絃索的急響，一個女的逼尖的聲音，跟着唱了起來。他這才發覺自己巳走過二三十家舗面了。</p>
<p>「怎樣？回去不回去試一試？」他的心在問他。他躊躇了。要是不試一下，那末來幾次的决心，不是都等於白費心血嗎？不試就是說一切都没有解决，都没有希望，就得窮一輩子！還有，說不定這次自己眞會中頭獎呢？要是不買，讓好運白白地在手裏溜走了，那不是冤死人？！橫堅是窮了，兩角錢算什麽···他重又打回頭·</p>

<p>一九三六年，許多人預料是第二次世界大戰的爆發期，照目前情勢而觀，這預料的實現，確有幾分可能。事實巳經這樣地在揭開了：在歐洲方面，軍縮早巳走到了絕地，德法，法意的衝突，一天尖銳一天，英國的歐洲均勢維持政策，目前巳經一無所用；同時，在遠東方面，則有日，美與英，日的對立，日本帝國主義無限制的膨脹，差不多使這個對立走到了白熱化，而日蘇的對立，</p>
<p>更使這問題加深一層的複雜。這樣，東西兩半球，同時戰雲密布，我們只看見各國的外交家，在怎樣縱捭闔，布置這個戰爭的局面。同時，各國的兵工廠，則是加緊的製造軍火。目前確是巳經到了「山雨欲來風滿樓」，國際風雲的日緊一日，巳經預報着第二次世界大戰的戰神，不久卽將降臨人間了。</p>
<p>法德的鬥爭，老早就是歐洲中心問題的所有，再加上法意鬥爭，這情形就更變複雜。希特勒登台，以地主資產階級爲背景的德國政權，竭力需要擴張國外經濟覇權；法國正是其唯一的鬥爭者。法國資本家所需要的，是永遠握取歐洲大陸的壟斷局面，使歐陸各國，都受其支配，德國的抬頭，當然是他們所萬萬不能允許的。這樣，德法的鬥爭，就更以較戰前英德鬥爭更爲激烈的局面而演出了。法意的鬥爭，再使這歐洲的鬥爭局面，變成了三角形式，而錯綜的起着更多的複作用。英國所要求的，則是一貫的維持歐洲均勢，團結歐洲的勢力，去對付美國，不幸這一政策，目前也巳走到了窮地。怎樣使這一歐洲的鬥爭局面可以相對的調和下去呢？這是目前英國所苦心去籌劃應付着的。而客觀的事實，却表現出了相反的局面，軍縮的一敗塗地，無法再可挽回，巳明示人們，歐陸的糾紛，是非從戰爭不能解决的了。</p>
<p>再看遠東方面。日美的對立，這是誰都知道的了。英日的對立，其程度也不下於美國。日本九一八的行動。早巳揭開了二次世界大戰的序幕，而當時各國因正大埋頭凖備，故日本雖首先發動，但尙不至卽刻接觸。至最近日本外務省非正式的發表聲明，中國須歸日本獨覇，他國不許問津，這局面又更進子一個新的階段。現在所尙成爲問題的，就是還没有得到引火的火種，一待得到火種，則戰爭的爆發，卽是明日的事。</p>
<p>遠東與歐洲，同時在開演着二次世界大戰的序幕。爆發期一天接近一天。目前只待各國的戰陣布置完竣，則接着便是腥風血雨的殺人事業的上塲。不問時期是否是在一九三六年，世界終必要經過一次更慘酷的大屠殺。而目前正是在更加緊的凖備時期。</p>
<p>帝國主義發展到最　期，終必有一塲戰爭　祇有戰爭。才是她最後的出路。然而戰爭　反面，也就是没落。不問牠是否願意，歷史終必這樣演進。帝國主義常就是這樣自巳做了自己的掘墓人。</p>
<p>立在這戰爭危機中的中國人怎樣呢？中國現在正是牠們鬥爭的目標。怎樣從這戰爭的危機中打出我們的生路，這是我們目前所應該竭力凖備着的！</p>
<h3 id="c321">東三省的一寳！人參！ <a href="#c321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>最近報上登載新聞說：日人在吉林採取人參，巳有大批運入關内售賣，并在平津設立經理處，有很大的組織，而且禁北國人前往採取，這是多麽痛心的事啊！土地權不權？我們且不說，因爲東北失土地久巳不屬於我們了。可是這些向來依靠採參而生活的人，從此無業，却有生計斷絕不虞，眞是徒喚奈何？古語說：「寗作太平犬，無爲亂世人。」如今大可改爲「寗作强國狗，無爲弱國人。」傷心事提也無益，傷心話說也不中，且來談一談人參吧？記得東北土諺說：「東三省，三件寳，人參，鹿葺，烏拉草。」其實三省的寳貝，豈止這一樣，除去自然界的開發鑛產而外，還有若干不與闊老們直接發生關係的</p>
<p>寳貝，所以不受世人的重視。人參產生在吉林的老山裏，林木深處，但又必不爲樹蔭遮蔽，須日光射曬之處，方能生長。牠算是一種結根草本植物，在中國醫藥史上，却坐着前三把交椅。牠的用處，和富貴人最有密切關係。換句話話說，凡是富貴人害的毛病，牠没有不治的，諸虚百損，温而不燥，補而不熱，其功效的口號，句句都能批入富貴人心坎裏。但是窮人絕對與牠無緣，雖過屠門，亦不能大嚼，惟有乾嚥唾沫，空嘆氣而巳。試看北平廊房頭二條胡同，望衡對宇的參葺莊，不亞於昔年匯票墏和銀號的威風氣慨啊！</p>
<p>人參的年齡，到五六十歲，就很可貴。牠的年譜，大約可分爲六個時期，一年至五年，生一個掌子」，五年至十年，生兩個葉，名呌「二來子」，二十年生三個葉，名「三台子」，三十年生四個葉，名「四品葉」，由三十年而四十，而五十，而至六十年，經過「五品葉」「六品葉」之名稱時期，就天然生齊了六個葉。如果土内的根，頭尾母肢齊整，幾百兩銀子換一隻，都說不定能否買到。採參的人，關裏人居多，大槪是屬於河南山西兩省，每二十人爲一組，入山之先，分派旣定，帶着武器，防備强盜與猛獸，好像探險一般。走直綫的，每組每人相隔百餘步，呼聲相應，以免迷失。若其中一人，瞧見參苗，便大呼「棒棰，」後面的同伴，就詢問「什麽棒棰？一發現參苗的一個，當察其外狀，屬於何類，答以「某棒棰。」此時衆人巳蜂擁而前，不約而同，大家齊聲喴，「拏！」其手術，係以紅綫縛參苗，鋪油布，伏而掘之，用竹刀由四週細心掘取，根鬚不能稍爲傷損，或一日，或二日，不能竣事，則守之不去，待全參取去，遂陳祭品，叩首謝山神。如所獲係六品葉大參，尙須用全羊充犧牲品。如今日人包辦壟斷了，不容國人插足其間，不知他們以何種方式進行掘參？據說採參這件事，的確含有半神秘的意味呢！</p>

<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>看熱閙，原爲我們中國人所尙。在孤燈下，年拳打手角鬥，固覺有趣；但街頭小　三口角，也常常會引起一羣行人環繞凝神注視。</p>
<p>不過，這僅是指在我們的眼綫可以直接看到的事情而言；此外，就像聽人家說一段流血的故事，或從雜誌報章上看到某處若干人被殺，某聞人閙了什麽天大的禍事，也是怪有味兒，令人神往的。</p>
<p>假使有人要問，人們爲甚會有這種心理呢？我以爲這大槪是現在一般人的内心太空虚了，太寂寞了；他們所需要的是張烈的刺激，像愛看獅　虎　的　片，　　冰　的　體跳舞一樣。</p>
<p>因這是現社會的一般心理，所以，一班辦雜誌報章的大，看着這一點，就專在製造些驚人的消息，或暗中攻奸他人，以取悅讀衆了；甚且，有些在同人中間，各自標出不同的旗幟，互相攻撃，互相漫駡，從字行間看來，好似非鬥個你死我活不可；但在幕後，又在握手言歡；我們是勝利了！</p>
<p>本來，愛看熱閙，也算不得十分壞的事情；如果能够辦别是非，由此引起興　來，而加進熱閙的集團，做其中的一員，倒不致被人家譏爲散沙，爲冷血動物。但，我們禮義之邦的人民，深懂得中庸之道，看熱閙，也只是看看而巳：看時旣没有什麽表示，過後，也就像並没有這麽一回事一樣的忘却了。</p>
<p>近年來，熱閙的事，在我們中國，也着實是層出無窮了。這眞是蒼天賜予我們愛有冷閙的人民的洪福啊！</p>

<p>— 雋</p>
<p>有了戀愛才有失戀·不遇這是一般有閒的公兒姐兒於吃喝之餘拿來消遺生活的一套玩藝。　三窮光棍是少有這福份兒的·正爲因生活十分閒逸之故，度日如年，就只有把所有的時間完全浪費在戀愛的一回事上，而且認爲比一切正當的事業都重要，戀愛與生活，差不多是成爲二位一體的關係。没有戀愛簡直就不能活，而不幸碰着失戀，那便更活不得了。特别是哥兒們一方面來得利害。他們一經失變，就像抽去了靈魂一般，這樣不爲，那樣不對，弄得食不甘味，　不安蓆，終日唉聲嘆氣，慘痛之狀</p>
<p>，如喪妣考。甚至則有因此欲生欲死，覺得旣巳失戀，四大皆空，萬念俱灰，人生再無什麽意味和價値，於是就勇敢地服安眠藥，上吊，跳海···一定非把生命毁掉不可。其實這種行爲在我看來却覺得有點那個」，並不算聰明。或者還有些　於阿○式的精祺。當然，　並不反對哥兒們耽於纞愛，也不想學正人君子的說話，不要將變愛看得那麽重，而應該做些有意義的事·不錯，愛情是人生不可缺少的東西，但我以爲可用不着過於認眞，尤其是對於失戀。太認眞就是自討苦吃，愛痛楚也就屬活該，自作自受，呌誰可憐你。所以能隨便一點不但不會感到痛苦，還佔了快樂的便宜。况且在這拜金主義的大都會裏，愛情是鍍金的，染滿銅臭的，祇要你有花不盡的鈔票，那包你無往而不馬到成功。什麽空靈精神都是活見鬼的烏話·同時女人也就變成了商品，有若干代價，便付你若干貨色·其間當然也有雜賣與整賣的不同。但總逃不了賣買交易的性質·都市的女人居多具着浪漫的性格，十三分輕視貞操氣節等的皮囊，醉心於所謂自由戀愛，好處未曾得到壞處却樣樣都能，喜歡新鮮，刺激，愛動·今日這個，明日那個，無論如何談不到長久的興　，把戀愛當成兒戲似的玩玩，這切都是目下流行着的時髦女郎共有的典型。</p>

<p>— 文光</p>
<p>年頭兒　　　　　　變了有的　　轉，有的向左轉；好像不轉　一下，就不適於生存似的。</p>
<p>或者有人說：「甚麽都可以轉變，但是人　對於審美態度，總不會不以妙齡女郎或年輕小子爲美，而反以鷄皮鶴髮的老太婆或老頭子爲美吧？」</p>
<p>現在我們且慢武斷，事實最雄辯，先得觀察觀察近來人們對於審美態度的趨回怎樣吧。</p>
<p>一九三四年有一萬二千個大明星參加的美國電影皇后選舉，所選出的皇后是曼麗特蘭漱，她巳年逾花甲，亞軍是惠爾羅吉士，他是個老頭子，素爲紳士和大腿迷戀着的美國人仕，也巳轉戀了。他們對於審美的中心。，點，轉到注意明星們的表演技術和藝術貢獻，而敝屣那唯物的審美態度；否則那些花枝招展的明星們，怎麽倒是落選呢？</p>
<p>幽默大家林語堂先生在他的「論語」裏說：「浮生六記」裏頭的芸，是中國第一美人。」至於芸的容貎，也並不十分美麗，她的丈夫沈三白且曾說：「兩齒微露，似非佳相。」要知林先生的審美中心點，着重於語言的風韻和議論的風采，芸能具此二者，所以我們頗能意想到她的面目可愛，而難怪林先生要說她是中國第一美人了。</p>
<p>張荔英所以願嫁陳友仁，是因爲張稱陳爲天下第一美男子，而美的條件是：不嫖，不賭，不飲酒，不抽烟，身體康健，至於張陳二人的年齡，雖然很像父女的等級，然而終因張荔英的審美態度的唯心化，竟成眷屬了。</p>
<p>以上三例，不是證明了近來審美態度的趨向准心觀而是甚麽？換句話說，就是　　　爲天經他　；　古不易的以唯物爲　心的審美態度，也巳轉變了。　　這　「轉變」，當然是前進的，革命的。</p>

<p>我憶起了昨夜的夢鄉。是的，有個何愛的夢甜蜜的夢，我昨兒晚上得到過的。昨晚睡得很遲，才睡着就夢到了我所愛的境地。在　夢中我並没得到第六其航空獎券的頭獎，我也没使我自己成一個極有權勢的大官。我祗夢見我斜倚在某花園的橋欄上，橋的對面有一叢碧翠的樹，在茂盛的枝葉的空𨻶裏路着一�</p>
<p>個美麗的少女底臉，向我笑，靜靜地笑𨻶橋下的水波上也映着那叢樹，那個臉。我們不開口，老是互相坐着笑，笑，靜靜地笑。</p>
<p>夢境展開了，我不復倚在橋欄上，樹枝間的美麗的臉也失了蹤。我似乎是坐在極大的草地上，雙手攀着我底膝。天上有一個明皓的團　的月，我望着可愛的天空和那光明的月亮，突然，在那圓圓的月亮裏我又瞧見了那個甜蜜的笑臉。一些没改動，依然是那樣靜靜地笑　　一片烏雲升了上來，遮掉了明月，遮掉了那可愛的臉。大地被黑暗籠置着　　於是我醒了。樓下的鐘正打四下。　　要不是隣室的歌聲，我一定會忘了昨晚有過這樣一個可愛的夢境的。然而，我憶起了又有什麽用呢？我現在不在夢境裏了啊，那可愛的笑臉不在樹枝裏也不在月面上啊！</p>

<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>自從婦女運動的旗幟展開後，被壓迫在數千年的深洲中的一大羣的婦女們，都能得到解放的機會，跑到社會上來同男人們享受各種權利與義務的，竟將數行年遺傳下來的封建傳統思想粉碎，而那斤斤對婦女們約束的鎖鍊，亦因此不得不漸漸斬斷，在婦女們的前程上，建築一個新的壁壘來！</p>
<p>雖然在過去男女們結合，同是受「父母之命，媒妁之言」的苦痛，而女子尤其感到那些没有經過戀愛的結合的痛苦，是要勝過男人們行萬倍喲！什麽好馬不配伶鞍子，烈女不嫁二夫君」的古訓，在一個男人，假若感到「父母之命，媒妁之言「的苦痛和不滿意自己的妻子到十分時，便可以在外面任意發洩自己的性慾，或者另娶，而社會是不與罪，而自己反以爲榮。要是在女子方面，因受丈夫種種的壓迫，和公婆等的打駡，而感到萬分的痛苦時，亦只好屆服在禮敎的鞭策之下，那裏取說出一句什麽離異，另嫁的話啊！·····</p>
<p>一切的封建和傳統的遺毒，漸漸隨着時代的潮流遊去了！所以從前的「父母之命，媒妁之言」男女的那種不合理的結合的制度，現在亦漸漸廢除，換上一個新的面目來。</p>
<p>男女的結合，要經過「戀愛」的歷程，是多末好聽的一個名詞呵！因而，一般靑年，都憑着自己一時的熱情，往往跑向兩個極端不同的－－「戀愛至上主義者」，和「極端性慾主義者」的路。</p>
<p>所謂「戀愛至上主義者」，牠否定一切唯物的理論，他認爲世間只有戀愛才能促起他生存，除了戀愛以外，便没有人生，没有一切，戀愛是神聖不可侵犯的，是至上的。他不知道，世間究竟有没有餓着肚子的人，還不講戀愛！許多仍然困愛在封建勢力王下的，無「三從四德」所束縛的女同胞們，有没有機會講纞愛，因此，我們便要知道，戀愛是絕對的，要受時間和空間的限制。</p>
<p>其次再談到「極端性慾主義者」。　　在申報本週婦女園地上面，碧雲君說得好：「有些新式的靑年男女，他她們在的對戀愛至上主義之下，便以爲兩性的關係，無所謂愛情，只是「性慾」而巳。於是今天在這裏發洩性慾，明天又到那裏去偷香窮玉，這簡直是失掉理智</p>
<p>，乃至感情的粗洩的唯物論的簡單主義者，他們根本就不懂得什麽呌「戀愛」一　　我們根據他的話，承認她說：　　（一）戀愛不是什麽至上的，而是要受人類生活，時代，社會的限制的；</p>
<p>（二）戀愛也不是至下的，純粹發洩性慾的東西，我們没有辦法完全否定在戀愛中的感情作用；</p>
<p>（三）戀愛不僅是性與感情的結合，而且是生活的結令，我們的戀愛，必須建築在互相了解，互相勉勵，思想和行動一致的基礎上面而且在生活上，要時時刻刻不忘努力改進人類的生活，促進社會的工作；</p>
<p>所以最後，我黨的一切現象，都隨着目前的制度在畸形化，病態化當中打滾，假若這整個的制度，得不到健全，而畸形的，去解决這部份的問題，仍然還是難於得到樂觀！</p>

<p>昨天他歸去的時候，授給我一張紙條，要我今天偷空到電影院去會他，這又什麽鬼鬼祟祟的，我得應了他。午後我推說買皮鞋，就坐車直到電影院，他早在門首等候我。買了二張花樓的票子，我們像一對情人似的坐着。�</p>
<p>「有什麽事？」我直捷的問。</p>
<p>「我有幾句話說。」他囁嚅的回答，那可憐的人！我握緊了他的手「雄哥，别那樣自苦了，我一切可以答應你！」</p>
<p>他感激地握緊了我的手，他像有許多話要說出來，但是始終是注視我的面上，最後进出一句「你愛我？」</p>
<p>我幾科乎想放聲大笑，點了點頭，電燈恰剛熄滅了，我就偎在他的懐中，這兩小時的愛的享受，我滿足了，我的靈魂巳附在他的身上，這瞬息要腐朽的肉體，隨牠去罷！</p>
<p>散塲出來，他不敢送我歸去，我僱了車後，他也走了。</p>
<p>昨夜我獨自坐在書桌前，到天色發白時候纔上床去，想記一些那時候的幻想，可是什麽都想不起來了，幻想倒底不是事實！</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 00:40 on the night of May 2nd, an explosion occurred on the eastern corner of Fushimi Street in the Japanese concession of Tianjin. The Provincial Public Security Bureau, to prevent any actions by rioters, immediately dispatched security teams, mounted patrols, and armored vehicles to patrol the Nanshi Jian'an Main Street and Hai Guang Si area. They withdrew early on the 3rd. (May 3rd Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) The Japanese garrison in Tianjin's Hai Guang Si practiced firing machine guns inside the barracks for half an hour at 2:00 PM on May 3rd, causing great panic among nearby residents. Only when the gunfire ceased at 2:30 PM did they realize the truth. (May 3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of May 1st, over a hundred Japanese soldiers arrived in Ninghe County in heavy military trucks. After disembarking, they conducted surveys outside the county seat and buried long-distance military telephone lines. In the evening, they practiced street fighting, causing great alarm among merchants and residents, who all closed their doors. The Japanese troops left along the Fengrun official road early on May 2nd. (May 3rd Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) On the night of May 2nd, an explosion occurred suddenly on Fushimi Street in the Japanese concession. The sound was heard throughout the city, and shops and residences in the area bordering the southern part of the Japanese concession closed their doors, creating a sudden atmosphere of terror. The Provincial Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the report, and deeply concerned that troublemakers would cause disruption, as it was the day after the May 1st Labor Day and May 3rd was the anniversary of the Jinan Massacre, took covert precautions. The entire Provisional Security Team was mobilized, and plainclothes special agents were deployed at the Sino-Japanese border. At 9:00 PM, they began inspecting pedestrians, and five armored vehicle teams set off from the Special Second District to patrol back and forth facing the Japanese concession gate, to maintain vigilance. By around 11:00 PM, the people's hearts began to settle, and the city gradually returned to normal. (May 3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>In reality, the government has not yet made a decision.

A reporter specifically asked the person in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the reply, some Sino-Japanese issues are purely local in nature and could be resolved locally, provided the Japanese side accepts China's principles of not ceding territory and not harming sovereignty. Direct negotiations are also not ruled out as a way to resolve outstanding issues. However, this refers to the principles for resolving Sino-Japanese issues. In reality, the government has not yet made any decision. (May 3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Japanese newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing are spreading rumors that communists have infiltrated eastern Chahar Province and are under the command of Feng Yuxiang, and that Song Zheyuan's troops may take unstable actions. Historically, whenever the Japanese wanted to occupy a place in China, they first fabricated rumors to slander China. This time, they are likely planning to extend their reach to Chahar Province, so they are first confusing the world to create a pretext for sending troops. (May 3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) American Ambassador Johnson told reporters on May 3rd that he originally intended to take the Jinpu Railway to Nanjing from Beiping for this trip, but because he had not been to Hankou for three years, he took a detour. In Hankou, in addition to inspecting the overseas Chinese and businesses, he also visited local military and political leaders. He stayed in Hankou for a week. Because he had not met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for over two years, he took a boat to Jiangxi on the 29th and met Chiang on the 30th. This meeting with Chiang was purely a courtesy visit and did not involve any mission. In addition to the friendly visit, he only inquired about the New Life Movement. Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet that evening, but Minister Kong was unable to attend due to illness. Furthermore, silver expert Roger Tolley previously visited Guling, and the Ambassador also met with him during this visit, briefly discussing the recent situation in the United States. He originally planned to descend the mountain on the morning of the 1st, but because it was Labor Day on May 1st, he and Rogers went to Xunyang on the evening of the 30th. The Ambassador boarded the Longhe ship to come east, while Rogers, because the weather had been very good recently, flew to Hankou by China Aviation plane on the afternoon of the 2nd. After visiting Hankou, he will come to Nanjing for a short stay, then go to Beiping for sightseeing. He does not yet know when he will leave China to return home. After arriving in Nanjing, the Ambassador met with Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 2nd and arranged to meet with President Wang at the Ministry of Railways at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The Ambassador will stay in Nanjing for about three days and take the express train to Shanghai on the night of the 5th, returning to Nanjing on the 7th. Then he will take the Jinpu Railway north to visit the spring scenery in Qufu, Tai'an, and other places, returning to the embassy in about ten days. As for this trip down the Yangtze River, he only made brief inspections in major cities such as Hankou and Xunyang. The road construction in various places is excellent, but the commerce has not developed much due to the impact of the world economic recession. The reporter also asked him about his observations on the situation in North China and the Far East. According to his reply, North China is currently stable. The US government had already issued a formal statement on the situation in the Far East on the 1st, clearly expressing the US attitude. He has no special opinions on this matter. As for the Sino-American commercial treaty, because he has not yet received instructions from the government, he is not prepared to discuss anything at this time.

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Japan's informal declaration on April 17th has aroused repercussions in world opinion and close attention from governments of various countries. This newspaper has also repeatedly analyzed its inside story and clarified the minimum stance of our nation. Realizing that justice cannot be erased, Japan has ordered its major ambassadors abroad to conduct a campaign to gain understanding of this declaration from their respective governments. When the British government realized that this declaration by Japan contained significant threats, it rose to question Japan and expressed its intention to jointly advocate with the United States to reaffirm the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy. Consequently, Hirota made a second declaration, saying that the informal declaration of April 17th "did not formally exist" to perfunctorily satisfy Britain, which Britain has deemed satisfactory. Recently, the US government issued an official document to Japan, which Japan regards as no less than a reiteration of the Stimson Doctrine. However, it also believes that it can obtain tacit agreement from the United States without further irritating the United States, and thus does not need to reply. Therefore, Hirota believes that the statement on its China policy has gained the understanding of the British and American governments and has reaped great results. In short, it is very clear that Japan will disregard Britain and the United States from now on and wholeheartedly focus on China.</p>
<p>Not only that, Japan's desire to implement its continental policy has never changed slightly. Judging from the surface, Japan's informal declaration this time seems very clumsy. It has not only aroused condemnation from world opinion and provoked resentment from our people, but also worsened the international relations in the Far East. It is also quite unfavorable to Japan itself. However, it is not known that Japan advocates peace and pretends to be friendly, but in reality, it is preparing its national policy of fighting a war every ten years, spreading the factors of war everywhere. Only by fulfilling its military power, it must first engage in its geographical convenience. In particular, it must first understand the situation in all aspects. Therefore, this informal declaration on April 17th actually contains cunning conspiracies, taking the opportunity to observe the true intentions and strength of the powers and to explore the trends of our people in order to prepare for actual acts of aggression. The so-called creation of fait accompli in the September 18th Incident is still fresh in our memories. In this regard, we should have a more profound and painful awareness.</p>
<p>It is not that our national strength is so weak and our national economy is so broken that unless we first seek full internal stability and appropriate cultivation, we will ultimately be powerless and unsuccessful externally. However, even today, people are scheming against us, leaving us no room to breathe and maneuver. Coupled with the complexity of the domestic situation, it is by no means easy to complete our various basic tasks with simple methods or in a short period of time. Today's China has already entered a very urgent period. It is impossible to seek temporary stability and prosperity with ordinary step-by-step methods and to seek rapid results. Therefore, the only way to break through the difficult situation is to unify the national movement front, awaken the national masses to jointly face the country's urgent difficulties, and resist external violence. Is not the past of Germany and Italy like this? Cannot the rejuvenation movement of Turkey be a lesson for our people? Emptyly advocating high-sounding foreign policies, without practical preparations, people rely on airplanes and giant cannons, and we rely on hot blood and small bodies, resulting in failure. This is certainly not possible. Seeking a way out for the country and society and seeking survival for the nation should not only rely on temporary emotional impulses. However, the crisis we face today is rare in modern European countries. Compared with the constraints of Germany under the Treaty of Versailles, it is even worse. Every move is subject to external constraints. How will our country get rid of this constraint? If we want to seek understanding in diplomacy, the international situation is already like this. Judging from Hirota's recent response to the questions from Britain and the United States and his expression of his policy toward China, his intentions are already clear. Japan's actual actions are still controlled by the military, and diplomatic activities are merely a technical job in its international relations. Therefore, we should pay attention to its actual content and should not regard its smokescreen as the truth. Under our country's urgent reality, there is no possibility of being perfunctory and complacent, and there is no room for leisurely debate about right and wrong. What will our national people, who still care about the survival of the nation, strive for and do to seek the unification of the entire nation as a support for diplomacy?</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to information from outside the Pass, the Japanese Sixth Division Hatanaka Unit stationed in Heilongjiang has been transferred back to the country and replaced by the Sixteenth Division Pumu Unit. The Tenth Division stationed in Harbin has been transferred back to the country and replaced by the Third Division Wakayama Yoshitaro Unit. This kind of troop movement is an increase in military strength. In reality, very few are transferred back, and there are many more who are added. The troops stationed along the puppet Fengshan Road are mainly infantry. The Hirahata Fourteenth Brigade has been ordered to return to the country. The 1,500 Japanese troops currently stationed in Jinzhou are part of the Second Infantry Brigade. The Eighth Division stationed in Rehe has returned to the country. Those currently stationed in various counties in Rehe are the entire Seventh Division. (May 3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Lewis stated in a speech in the Senate this morning that the United States will consistently adhere to its treaty rights in China, which is the unanimous position of the American people. Lewis, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, continued in his speech, stating that Ambassador Grew, following instructions from Secretary of State Hull, replied to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's declaration, rejecting Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine. This is the public voice of all Americans, not just the private opinion of an official in the party government. Japan's attitude may satisfy Britain, but this cannot immediately be considered as satisfying the United States as well. We do not want any military or personal conflicts, but to avoid conflicts, we can only protect our rights. (May 2nd Nationalist Telegram)</p>
<p>Lewis also said that Japan believes it has the right to supervise the commercial relations between China and the powers, and may even adopt the same policy toward the Philippines. Now that the United States has granted the Philippines its independence, this layer is deeply worrying. In the United States, the people and Congress should support Hull to make it clear to the European powers that the note sent by the US government to Japan is not a meaningless expression. (May 2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Editorials in major newspapers across the United States have all praised Hull's statement, recognizing that the statement is concise, well-rounded, and timely. Although the tone is friendly and peaceful, it insists on the basic principles held by the United States. Japan must respect treaty obligations, especially the obligations in the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-Aggression Pact. The United States is willing to maintain all its rights in China and is also willing to fulfill all its obligations in China. This statement is the first diplomatic action taken by the Roosevelt administration towards the East. Political changes have been inevitable, but traditions are maintained. However, if Japan cannot keep its promises, maintain the Open Door Policy in China, respect valid treaties, and abandon its demands for preferential rights, then the problem cannot end there.

<p>Regarding Hull's statement</p>
<h3 id="e34">Tokyo Maintains Silence, Actively Employing Magic Powers Against Us; US-Japan Efforts Ruined by Warlords <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement on its China policy has come to a close after Foreign Minister Hirota announced Japan's policy to China and foreign countries on the 1st. Unexpectedly, US Secretary of State Hull's statement in Washington on the 30th, after a detailed review by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, still contained points of dissatisfaction. The Foreign Ministry leaders are paying close attention to this matter, consulting for days on whether the Japanese government should issue a formal statement or clarify Japan's position in other effective forms. However, according to the current situation, the following opinions are generally held within the Foreign Ministry and are quite influential: The informal statement issued by the Foreign Ministry on the 17th temporarily became the center of world public opinion. However, the Japanese government asked the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, to convey the Japanese government's views to his home government, and Foreign Minister Hirota also met with the British and American ambassadors on the 1st to clearly state Japan's China policy. The British and American governments also understood Japan's true intentions, so this issue seemed to have come to an end. The US government instructed Ambassador Grew to convey the Japanese government's memorandum on the 26th, but it only unilaterally expressed the US government's views and did not request a reply from the Japanese government. Moreover, Japan has no objection to the US government's views, so there is no need to refute them one by one. Japan can maintain peace in East Asia together with China in accordance with its established policy. (3rd, Japan United Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has been particularly focused on easing the American atmosphere regarding the statement of April 17th. However, compared to Secretary of State Hull's statement on the 30th and British Foreign Secretary Simon's response to the House of Commons, the United States seems to have other intentions. According to diplomatic sources, Foreign Minister Hirota is particularly concerned that his peaceful diplomacy with the United States, despite repeated dispatching of goodwill envoys and Ambassador Saitō's proposal for a US-Japan non-aggression treaty, has not gained the approval of the United States. However, the US authorities were actually waiting for the Japanese side to propose a concrete plan regarding the Manchuria and non-aggression treaty issues before the statement on the 17th, and were prepared to give it serious consideration if it was very beneficial to the United States. However, Hirota missed this opportunity and was manipulated by the military, issuing its own policy of monopolizing East Asia and destroying its peaceful diplomacy with the United States. The US authorities perceived that it was a warlord-style diplomacy. Therefore, the US authorities will disregard any proposals from the Japanese side in the future. It is extremely difficult to expect effective diplomatic work with the United States from Foreign Minister Hirota in the future. Moreover, the so-called informal statements on the 17th and 20th were actually issued by Information Bureau Director Amau. Like Yosuke Matsuoka, Amau has always been recognized as a military faction diplomat. The United States is also aware of this fact, so its diplomacy with Japan, while the military government still exists, makes it difficult to change its denial of the puppet state and other policies in the short term.

<p>(Tokyo) This morning, former Minister of the Imperial Household, Kido Itoki, paid a special visit to Elder Saionji, holding talks for about half an hour before leaving. Itoki is being considered as a candidate for the next prime minister, and his meeting is drawing attention in political circles. (3rd, China United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Baron Yūzō Kuratomi, Speaker of the Privy Council, has submitted his resignation due to disagreements with Vice-Speaker Kiichirō Hiranuma and some councilors. As a result of discussions between Prime Minister Saitō and Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, Baron Kido Itoki was selected as his successor. This morning, Elder Saionji also invited Itoki to his private residence to request his appointment. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Prime Minister Saitō entered the Imperial Palace to report on Speaker Kuratomi's resignation. Then, at 5:00 PM, he entered the Imperial Palace with the new Speaker Itoki to hold the appointment ceremony. Itoki, the new speaker, is the former Minister of the Imperial Household, the founder of Japanese constitutionalism, and a supporter of it. He was listed as a target for assassination by army and navy officers and the Blood Pledge Corps during the May 15 Incident. Therefore, both political parties are extremely pleased with his appointment as speaker. (3rd, China United News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The third conference of local governors of the Saitō Cabinet was convened today. Tomorrow, the prime minister and other ministers will give instructions. The conference will continue until the 11th. This conference is a great opportunity for the Saitō Cabinet to let the people know its intentions and win back the hearts of those who are gradually turning away, at a time when the Saitō Cabinet is determined to take charge of the situation after the parliament. Therefore, great expectations are placed on the results of this conference. (3rd, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota will instruct on the outline of Japan's cooperative diplomacy at the conference of local governors on the 4th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In view of the fact that Japan is the only stabilizing force in East Asia, diplomatic issues should also be resolved on this basis. (2) However, as stated in the imperial rescript on withdrawing from the League of Nations, there is no change in the principle of peaceful diplomacy based on the spirit of cooperation among all nations. (3) Although relations with various countries were somewhat less than satisfactory for a time after withdrawing from the League of Nations, they quickly returned to normal.</p>
<p>Regarding relations with the United States: The United States has gradually understood Japan's position in East Asia, and there is currently no unrest in US-Japan relations.</p>
<p>Regarding relations with Russia: Negotiations on the Eastern Railway are gradually improving, and there is a glimmer of hope for a solution. Relations between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo" are expected to be satisfactory at this time.</p>
<p>Regarding relations with Britain: The Japan-India trade issue has been resolved and will begin soon.</p>
<p>Regarding relations with China: China's attitude towards Japan shows signs of gradual moderation and an attitude of sharing responsibility for maintaining peace in East Asia. Finally, "Manchukuo" implemented the imperial system on March 1st, and the foundation of the new country is solidifying and moving towards Wangdao politics. (3rd, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>

<p>Matsudaira's Speech: Both Countries Need to Be Friendly (London) According to today's news, negotiations between British Secretary of Commerce Runciman and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira regarding competition from Japanese goods have not yet produced any understanding. Although Runciman has worked hard to obtain a basis for direct negotiations, he has been unsuccessful. Therefore, it is widely believed that Runciman will inform Matsudaira tomorrow that if an understanding cannot be reached, the United Kingdom will have no choice but to adopt a plan to protect its own interests in conjunction with its colonies. Lancashire members of parliament expect the British Secretary of Commerce to announce in the House of Commons on May 7 that the colonies will adopt a quota system to restrict the import of Japanese goods, and overseas self-governing territories can initiate their own decision-making methods. It is thought that self-governing territories will also sympathize with British policy. According to the Japanese side, any proposals to be discussed should be put forward by the British government. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers all predict that colonies will issue quota regulations for the import of Japanese goods. The Times said in an editorial today that the British government proposes, with the consent of the colonies, to take the necessary steps to restrict Japanese goods imported into the colonial market. The method adopted will probably be a quota system that does not hinder the most-favored-nation treatment obligation. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

At the end of the banquet, Ambassador Matsudaira delivered a speech, emphasizing that international relations require mutual understanding. He said that there has never been more mutual understanding between Britain and Japan than there is today. Matsudaira also said that the best way to maintain peace and prosperity in the Far East, and even peace and prosperity in the world, is for all nations to express sincerity and to fully understand each other in a spirit of friendship. Especially under today's circumstances, it is particularly important for Britain and Japan to calmly study each other's mutual interests. (2nd, Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Foreign Ministry at 10:30 AM today, holding talks for about two hours. The Soviet ambassador requested the speedy release of the fishing boat "Teshikov," which had been detained by the Japanese navy, in order to allow it to carry out fishing operations and avoid missing the season. The Foreign Minister replied that he would conduct a remote investigation and reply soon. At the same time, he also said that the fishing season is approaching and he hopes that two other issues can be resolved quickly. The release of Captain Kotohira of the Japanese fishing boat detained by Soviet Russia last year should be considered first, and the results of the bidding for fishing areas should also be processed as soon as possible.

According to the report, the problem of overproduction and insufficient consumption cannot be solved by national actions alone. The report also discussed the situation in various countries, stating that the significant progress of Japanese exports is not entirely due to the rapid increase in production capacity or the low wages and labor conditions in Japan. The sole reason is the low value of the currency. The depreciation of the currency has disrupted international commercial relations, as such commercial relations are the result of exchange rate stability. The report later discussed the labor situation in the United States, which is very optimistic. (2nd, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Trotsky, the exiled Soviet Russian, has requested a place to settle from the President of the Irish Free State, Eamon de Valera, in the midst of extreme disappointment and nowhere to settle. His view is that since the British government does not allow Trotsky to enter the country, perhaps Ireland can reverse the British government's policy. However, British newspapers say that Valera is a devout Christian, and Trotsky previously inflicted all kinds of cruelty on Christians when he was in power in his own country. Therefore, Valera will never betray his faith and accommodate a fallen exile. (2nd, National News)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Comparison of Military Preparations in Various Countries; Soviet Russia Ranks First in the World with 1.3 Million Regular Troops; Can Be Increased to 7.5 Million in Wartime <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) There are currently 4 million regular troops in Europe defending the borders of various countries. Once war is declared, there are another 32 million trained soldiers ready to go. The above statistics are the current military strength in Europe announced by military experts. The 24 countries in Europe can dispatch 36 million trained soldiers to the battlefield in wartime, of which one-ninth are currently armed. This means that nearly one percent of the people in European countries are actually armed, and those who can be sent to the battlefield within a few minutes account for 10% of the entire European population. It is also remembered that the British draft arms reduction treaty hoped to limit the maximum number of regular troops in major European countries to 300,000, which is really difficult for the countries to accept. According to one expert, Soviet Russia is now the world's leading land power, with 1.3 million regular troops, which can be expanded to 7.5 million in wartime, but this only accounts for 0.79% of its people. The British army accounts for 1% of its population, France for 1.5%, Italy for 1%, and the Czech Republic for 1.17%. Hitler's party members are deeply dissatisfied that Germany is only allowed to have an army of 100,000. Most experts believe that although Germany's formal army only accounts for 0.5% of its population, it can still mobilize millions of people who have been in the National Socialist Party and paramilitary teams in wartime. France has about 600,000 regular troops, and Italy has more than 400,000. It is said that the two countries can mobilize 5 million trained people in wartime. Poland has 300,000 regular troops and can increase to 3 million in wartime. The United States has 135,000 regular troops and 4 million in wartime. The United States' regular army only accounts for 0.34% of its population. The cost of regular armies in Europe is enormous. According to statistics from the Disarmament Conference, France and Poland each use one-third of their budgets for national defense and naval and air force equipment. Italy spends 25% of its budget, the United Kingdom 15%, and the United States' military expenditure accounts for 8.6% of its total budget. Soviet Russia accounts for 6.5%. (3rd, National News)</p>

<p>(Paris) This month, the French Navy will hold the most important exercises since the war in the eastern Atlantic. At that time, French fast ships will gather to perform simulated battles and practice new tactics. Since France has developed its new navy based on the speed of its marches and the power of its artillery, old tactics are not only useless, but old ships are slow and dangerous compared to new cruisers with 8-inch guns. The Second Fleet stationed in Brest will participate in the exercises, with the Air Force assisting and the First Fleet stationed in Toulon coordinating with it. The First Fleet has 10,000-ton cruisers such as the Foch, Colbert, Duquesne, and Dupleix. The First Fleet will sail from Toulon to Brest to join the Second Fleet. The two fleets will then practice new tactics according to the plans predetermined by the Naval Staff. (3rd, National News)</p>

<p>(Berlin) By the end of this year, the number of Hitler Youth will reach six million. The number of Catholic Youth groups is about one million, and the issue of their joining still awaits the approval of the Pope. However, these Catholic Youth have already begun working for the Hitler Youth and have stipulated a new covenant, that is, they will still receive religious education for two Sundays a month and two days a week, and the Hitler Youth will provide political education during the afternoon hours of the other two or three days and two Sundays. The Hitler Youth organization is divided into two parts: boys and girls aged 14 to 18 are one part, and those aged 10 to 14 are the other part. Girls are taught home economics, handicrafts, and some political education, and they march with the boys. The training for boys is more arduous. The main task of the Hitler Youth is to cultivate a group of leaders to train countless children. All young people in the Hitler Party enter the Stormtroopers once they pass the age of 18. Several thousand graduated young people have already done so last year, and most are still continuing their training, hoping to become future leaders. This will continue this year.

<h3 id="e50">Seeking Other Solutions; Hoping Congress Will Pass Legislation; Economic Recovery, Industrial and Commercial Progress <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Senate silver faction members are scheduled to meet with President Roosevelt on Saturday and Sunday to agree on a flexible silver bill to be passed during this congressional session. The silver faction leader is confident that a solution can be found. Senator Pittman said that the purpose of the consultations on Saturday and Sunday is to determine whether the Dies bill can be amended so that the President can use it without feeling difficulties in any changes in the situation. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) In order to force the passage of the silver bill, Senator Thomas suggested in the Senate today that the government be authorized to accept silver as payment for foreign purchases of American goods. The suggestion is an amendment to the Glass Act that the government hopes to pass, in order to prevent the government from shelving the bill. The Glass Act authorizes the government to lend money directly to small industries and is one of the government's most important bills on the agenda for this congressional session. The Thomas Amendment stipulates that the government's import and export banks have the right to raise the world price of silver by 20 to 25 percent, buy or receive silver as payment for foreign purchases of agricultural surpluses and manufactured goods, and deposit the silver obtained in the Treasury as reserves for the issuance of silver coins or silver certificates. Senator Pittman announced that President Roosevelt will hold a special meeting with the silver faction at the White House on Saturday, at which time the President may present a concrete silver plan, but Pittman and government leaders have not made any further statements regarding the content of the agenda. The Thomas Amendment stipulates the effectiveness of gold and silver as follows: (1) Standard currency, (2) Basis for issuing banknotes, (3) Currency reserve ratio, gold accounts for 70 percent and silver accounts for 30 percent. This ratio was mentioned by President Roosevelt at the meeting with the silver faction. The Dies bill has been passed by the House of Representatives and has been shelved by the Senate Committee for two weeks. The bill authorizes the government to accept silver as payment for foreign purchases of American surplus agricultural products, but its application is not as broad as the Thomas Amendment.

<p>(Washington) The US Chamber of Commerce held a meeting today, with 2,000 industrialists and businessmen in attendance. Chamber of Commerce Chairman Harriman delivered a speech, listing the good results of various economic recovery regulations, saying that the government's efforts to rescue agriculture, although not a failure, were not a great success. There is no doubt that the new economic recovery policy will be implemented for a long time, because the unregulated free competition in the economy should not be allowed to reappear in the United States. However, although the economic control policy should continue to be implemented, the power of control should not be completely vested in the administrative organs. Most of the powers currently granted to the various organs of the Recovery Administration should be transferred to several federal organs that cooperate with industrialists. Harriman then went on to describe the effects that the economic recovery policy has already achieved, such as (1) The number of unemployed people reached 13 million in February 1933, but is now only 7 million. In normal economic times in the United States, there are 3 million unemployed people. If this number is removed, the actual number of unemployed people is only 4 million. (2) Agricultural income was 100 million to 110 million yuan in normal times, but fell to 50 million yuan in 1932, and has now risen to 60 million to 70 million yuan. (3) The index of commercial activity was 60.7 percent in February 1933, but increased to 78.5 percent in March of this year. On the other hand, the opinion of Robertson, the general manager of Westinghouse Electric Company, is slightly different. Robertson took the words of Ball, a key figure in the brain trust, as the starting point of his theory, saying that it is not important in Ball's view whether the economic control policy is social universalism or communism. However, it is very important in the view of the other 122.3 million Americans. In addition, some members of Congress are quite concerned about the trend of the new economic policy. Interior Minister Ickes recently asked the President to submit a bill to the House of Representatives requesting the expansion of the government's power to supervise coal and oil. It is said that the House of Representatives will soon investigate how the Interior Minister is implementing the coal and oil industry regulations, and will also investigate the management of agricultural relief affairs.

<p>(New York) The National Recovery Administration took an important step today, that is, all silk mills in the country should be shut down for a week. All 900 silk mills in the country and more than 30,000 workers will stop working from May 14 to the 21st. The implementation of this policy is due to the recent sluggish market conditions for silk fabrics, the tragic fall in sales prices, and the heavy increase in factory costs. It is said that some factories are forced by the situation to operate for only 10 days a month, and very few can operate normally. The nationwide shutdown for a week may remedy the current overproduction of the silk industry. After resuming work on May 21, it can greatly benefit the general employees. (2nd, National News) (Washington) President Roosevelt announced today that he intends to allocate 2 billion gold yuan to build housing in order to reduce the number of unemployed people. Roosevelt also said that he will expedite the passage of this bill in this congressional session. The current difficulty lies in the activities of heavy industry. The steel, automobile, railway, and other industries all have active signs, but the construction industry is far less than that, so we will do our best to remedy it. (2nd, National News)</p>

Furthermore, the President's health is being examined by several famous doctors, including the renowned medical scholar Professor Sauerbruch. According to Professor Sauerbruch, the President's health has now recovered. It is remarkable for an 86-year-old to be so vigorous. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

In addition to reporting to the central government, we send this telegram to inform you, deeply hoping that the party and country elders and gentlemen will provide guidance and correct our shortcomings.

<h3 id="e118">Germany's Relief of Unemployment (Berlin Correspondence) Large-Scale Construction and Street Fundraising <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The unemployment problem in Germany was a major issue during the Social Democratic Party's reign. Two years ago, there were signs of an economic alliance in the world, and the export of German goods showed a downward trend. At that time, the method of relieving unemployment was to rely on government spending for relief funds or unemployment insurance. However, the government did not have any alchemy itself, and its method of income was still to rely on public debt and taxes to pay for it. Once industry declined, finance stagnated, overseas exports decreased, and the pressure of debt increased, Germany had no choice but to let its unemployed increase day by day, and the economy was almost on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>At the time when Hitler came to power (January of last year), the number of unemployed was about six million or more. As a result of the Hitler government's desperate efforts, by the autumn of last year, it had been reduced to 2.25 million people. However, this included seasonal factors, so from the winter of last year to the beginning of this year, the number of unemployed rose again to about 3.7 million people. Now the Hitler government is still taking this matter as its target. He wants to reduce the number of unemployed to less than two million people after the summer of this year.</p>
<p>The methods of reducing unemployment can be divided into two categories. One is a more serious attitude, and its business is also more</p>
<p>is of a permanent nature. The other one, although it is also concentrating spirit when working, always feels a bit comedic in nature, and the time limit is very short and it is not easy to continue.</p>
<p>The first type of method, first, is to build automobile roads. Germany is planning to become the first automobile country in Europe in the next two or three years. The government expects to build a six-thousand-kilometer automobile road network. These roads are all paved with asphalt and built quite carefully. In the past year, one thousand five hundred kilometers have been successfully built. However, how much effect these roads have on actual production, and how much effect they have in alleviating Germany's current economic panic, cannot but be questioned. The second is to open up wasteland, but this method of opening up wasteland is different from the masses. This is the coastal filling project and the irrigation project in the marshland. Build dikes far away on the seashore, expel the seawater within the scope of the dikes, and obtain land suitable for cultivation. This has already started on the North Sea coast, such as Frisia. Irrigating barren marshland properly will turn it into fertile land. It has already started near Hanover. Both of these projects are very large, requiring not only huge amounts of money, but also countless labor. Of course, these are not businesses that can be effective in the short term, and at the same time, Germany's unemployment problem cannot be completely resolved in the short term.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is temporary relief. The money raised by the first "Winter Relief Movement" that ended from last winter to March of this year totaled 320 million marks. From this, it can also be seen that the members of the National Socialist Party are too blatant. "Stormtroopers" are spread all over the streets and alleys to beg for donations. Even as soon as you go out, you will encounter donation team members. If you meet them and refuse to donate or escape home, you will be stigmatized as unpatriotic. Therefore, many people hide in their homes and dare not go out easily. There is also the so-called "One Dish Sunday," which means that on that Sunday's lunch, each person can only eat one dish. Afterwards, National Socialist Party members come out and collect fifty pfennigs from each household. In each restaurant, only one dish is allowed to be eaten, but it charges double the price. After gathering, the owner of the restaurant donates it. It is said that the total income of "One Dish Sunday" in Berlin is 400,000 marks. Another interesting thing is to restrict women's labor, and even prohibit both husband and wife from having a job together. The meaning of this is roughly based on ethical aspects, to return women to the path of being good wives and mothers as the main body, but the economic meaning of reducing unemployment is also there. And desperately encouraging marriage, all newly married people who form a family can get a long-term low-interest loan of one thousand marks from the government. This year, the Ministry of Finance budget has 250,000 marriage groups and is prepared with such a large marriage fund to lend to them. Also, those who have three children are exempted from repaying the loan. Furthermore, National Socialist Party members selling fabric flowers, linen badges, and glass badges pinned on their chests on the streets are also everywhere. This is also a means of relieving unemployment.</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek Decides to Train</p>
<h3 id="e120">Personnel for Post-Banditry Affairs in Bandit Areas, Opens Post-Banditry Training Classes, Orders Fujian and Jiangxi to Recommend Cadres <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, since the large-scale joint suppression by the five provinces, the areas occupied by the bandits have been successively recovered. Currently, the areas occupied by the bandits in southern Jiangxi are only Ruijin, Huichang, Duyu, Ningdu, Shicheng, and Xingguo counties, and in northwestern Fujian, they are Changting, Qingliu, Liancheng, Ninghua, and Jianning counties. At present, as the various armies are advancing rapidly, it will not be difficult to recover the above counties in a short period of time. Disinfecting and restoring prosperity in bandit areas that have been transformed into bandit areas for seven or eight years or six or seven years is extremely difficult with so many different threads. Chairman Chiang has decided to open a local post-banditry training class for recovered county areas in order to create special personnel who can be competent and happy. Regarding the training personnel, telegrams have been sent to the provincial governments of Jiangxi and Fujian to recommend personnel. The telegram reads as follows: "In order to reserve personnel for handling local post-banditry affairs in the recovered county areas of Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, this Provisional Headquarters has specially established a "Local Post-Banditry Training Class for Recovered County Areas." Members are divided into three categories: those with military and political knowledge and rich experience in bandit suppression are in the first category. The provincial government recommends ten people (Fujian) and twelve people (Jiangxi) to be prepared to be selected in the future to fill the positions of county magistrates of Changting, Qingliu, Liancheng, Ninghua, and Jianning counties and Ningdu, Shicheng, Ruijin, Yudu, Huichang, and Xingguo counties. Those who have research and experience in county administration are in the second category, and each member of the first category recommends nine people to be prepared to be selected in the future to fill the positions of assistant administrators and district chiefs in the counties. The third category is composed of virtuous and good people from the five (Fujian) and six (Jiangxi) counties mentioned above who have administrative experience and are willing to return to their hometowns after recovery to handle local post-banditry work. The provincial government interviews and recruits fourteen people from each county to be prepared to be selected in the future to fill the positions of clearing and post-banditry committee cadres. In addition to the regulations being issued separately and telegraphed separately, the provincial government should first send the first category of personnel that should be guaranteed as soon as possible in accordance with the number, so as to allow for investigation and verification before joining the training. As for the third category of personnel, it is hoped that they will be interviewed and recruited as soon as possible and submitted for assessment. To be sure, Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek) seal."</p>
<p>Draft Reform of Local Political System</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, recently the Central Government proposed a draft to reform the local political system, changing the provincial committee system to the provincial governor system. The Southwest attached great importance to this and proposed research. After several discussions, it formulated opinions to review the draft, and on the 24th of this month, it was submitted to the 117th meeting of the Southwest Political Affairs Council. It was resolved to pass it and submit it to the Central Government for consideration and verification. The original text of the opinion on reviewing the draft reform of the local administrative system is recorded as follows: "It is verified that the provincial system should be formulated in accordance with the Prime Minister's system of balanced power. The meaning of this has been explained in detail in the preliminary review of the draft constitution, so it will not be discussed here. However, this draft is to reform the current provincial system, so the following opinions are based on the current actual situation. It is verified that the original intention of the original proposal is that the relationship between the current provincial and county system and the various competent ministries and commissions of the Central Government is unclear, the responsibility of the provincial committee system is not specific, the organization of the provincial government's various departments is huge, the political orders of the provincial government and the various competent departments are divergent, the organization of the provincial government itself is unreasonable, and the division of powers of the county government, the simplicity of the organization, and the inability to determine the county's finances, etc., are all sufficient to hinder the progress of administration, so a reform is proposed. It is judged whether this draft is appropriate, and it is still judged by whether it can improve the above-mentioned points. After carefully examining the first and second sections of Item A of the original draft, the original intention was to clearly define the relationship between the province and the various competent ministries and commissions of the Central Government, and the intention was indeed steady. However, this is only a legal issue and has nothing to do with the system. This regulation can be modified in the current provincial government organizational law, and there seems to be no need to involve the entire system. As for changing the provincial committee system to the provincial governor system, the intention of the original draft is to remedy the point of irresponsible management. However, this is only observed on the surface. If the drawbacks are exhausted, it not only goes against the purpose of pooling wisdom and benefiting from each other, but also once implemented, it is feared that the disadvantages will outweigh the advantages. The provincial government established three divisions: General Affairs, Civil Affairs, and Finance, and two departments: Education and Construction, as stipulated in Item 4. Except for the General Affairs Division, which is the renamed of the current provincial government secretariat, which is of no great importance and will not be discussed, it is verified that the two departments of Civil Affairs and Finance are relatively busy in most provinces. Therefore, when the provincial committee system was not implemented in the past, the Finance Department had been independently established. This is to adapt to the needs of the facts, which we cannot criticize. After examining the reform plan, the most important part was changed from a department to a division, while the two departments of Education and Construction, which have simpler affairs, still set up departments as usual, and clearly stipulate that they issue department orders. The current system is both messy and inconsistent, and it is even more untrue. It is also said in the original draft that the divergence of political orders between the current provincial government and the various competent departments is inherently incapable of being reformed, and it is even more feared that it may be intensified. The so-called reform is only sufficient to cause disturbances. The provincial government established a provincial assembly as stated in Item 8. Although the organization of the assembly was not mentioned, it is likely that it is a people's autonomous organization. If the provincial council is similar to the current provincial government committee meeting, it seems to have the nature of a provincial government administrative meeting. However, the original draft clearly stipulates that when the provincial assembly is adjourned, the provincial council will exercise its powers within a certain scope on its behalf, which is tantamount to the government exercising the powers of the people on its behalf. Although it is said that there are also members of the provincial assembly in the provincial council, the number of places is ultimately a minority. Is this method reasonable, it seems that there are still doubts. In summary, it is obvious that the various items listed in Item A of the original draft regarding the reform of the provincial system cannot reform the shortcomings of the current system as recognized in the original proposal. Even more telling, all provinces are now actively preparing for local autonomy, and recently there is a proposal to complete autonomy and end political tutelage within a limited time. As for the implementation of the provincial governor system, it is thought that it is better to wait until the local autonomy in each province is completed and implement it when the popularly elected provincial governors are elected than to rush to make meaningless reforms now. As for Item B, the reform of the county system, except for the fifth and sixth items, which relate to the county assembly and the county council, and the opinions on the eighth and ninth items of the reform of the provincial system are the same and have been detailed above, and will not be repeated. The remaining items are either not much different from the current system, or are merely changing the form without changing the substance, and are all of no great importance and will not be discussed."

<p>Hankou Correspondence, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that the more opium prohibition is carried out over the years, the more rampant it becomes. Effective methods should be adopted and implemented on schedule. The former stationed in Hankou, the headquarters has promulgated various opium prohibition regulations, including (1) Prohibition of planting: Except for remote provinces such as Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, the inland provinces absolutely do not allow the planting of opium, and it is required to be uprooted within a limited time, so that no seedlings emerge from the soil. (2) Prohibition of smoking: Party, government, military service personnel, and students strictly undergo opium cessation and inspections. Young men and women are also not allowed to smoke freely. (3) Prohibition of transportation: Except for limited collection and transportation in remote provinces, no private individual or organization shall be allowed to transport it without authorization. (4) Prohibition of sale: Those who are granted licenses to operate soil paste shops must obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations, and must not set up branches or collude, especially prohibiting the lighting of lamps for people to smoke. The decree has been issued to all places long ago, but it has recently been found that opium dens are rampant in Hankou, and the number of opium addicts is increasing day by day. Young men and women are especially addicted to it. If the ban is not reiterated, there will never be a day to completely ban it. Therefore, on the 24th of last month, a telegram was sent to the chairman of the provincial government, Zhang Qun, and the director of the Opium Prohibition Supervision Office, Li Jihong, to close all opium dens in Wuhan by the end of last month. Even those who have already obtained licenses to operate soil paste shops are not allowed to light lamps for people to smoke. They are only allowed to sell soil paste in accordance with the regulations, and are not allowed to hang shop signs or post advertisements. Anyone under the age of forty is prohibited from smoking, and those who violate the rules will be punished. After receiving the order, Zhang and Li separately ordered their subordinates to comply. By the 30th, all opium dens in Wuhan had closed down in compliance with the order. The provincial government believes that the opium prohibition in various counties and cities should also adopt strict measures, and has ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to be responsible for handling it. In remote counties in western Hubei and northern Hubei, it has been found that many opium poppy seedlings are being planted privately. The Department of Civil Affairs will also preside over the armed uprooting, and those who violate the rules will be punished. (May 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e123">Large Army May be Cleared Again Soon, Fang's Bandits' Tax Collection Posts Have Also Been Destroyed <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence, the red bandit Fang Zhimin's faction, which has been entrenched in eastern Jiangxi and has caused trouble for many years, has recently been gradually suppressed by the armies of Zhao Guantao, Yu Jishi, Tang Huiyuan, and Liang Lizhu. In addition to the recovery of the two bandit nests of Zhoufang and Xiangu Mountain, they are now advancing towards Hengfeng and Geyuan and other places where Fang's faction is concentrated, and are blocking them layer by layer in order to encircle and annihilate them. Now, the base of Fang's faction is under attack from all sides, and the bandits are exhausted and have no way to return. Their internal strength is no longer strong. Once the large army launches another attack, it will not be difficult to clear them soon. As for Fang Fusan's scattered bandits who were operating in the border area between Anhui and Jiangxi, they have also been in a state of utter embarrassment since Chen Diaoyuan was stationed in Wuyuan and repeatedly suppressed them severely. Now, most of them have broken up into smaller groups and fled in different directions. Yesterday, a small group fled into Chongtian and Youting and other places in western Wuyuan, attempting to flee to Fuliang and Qimen. In order to prevent the scattered bandits from causing internal trouble, Chen Diaoyuan is sending troops to search and suppress them to ensure that no one escapes. The Dehui, Shanghe, and Tongbu, where Fang's bandits set up posts to collect taxes, were recovered by the suppressing army on the 20th. This place is an important port on the Wude River waterway. The bandits set up posts here to collect taxes and detain merchants' goods. It has been three or four years. Although the stationed army has repeatedly destroyed them, the bandits came back as soon as the stationed army withdrew. Recently, the bandits in that area were building fortifications. Very deep trenches were dug around the village. The trenches were filled with sharp bamboo nails, covered with soil and grass. People walking on it would fall into the trenches and be pierced to death by the nails. Many landmines were also hidden in the small paths and avenues in an attempt to resist stubbornly. This time, the suppressing army used heavy wooden wheels to push forward as a guide, advancing when there was no danger and avoiding when there was danger, so it was able to break through. Now, the suppressing army is advancing towards the Nuanshui area in order to directly attack the base of Fang's bandits in Dexing. (April 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Eighth Division of the Southern Route Army Stationed at Junling: A Month of Battle Situation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Second Column of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, commanded by Li Yangjing, used howitzer cannons to capture Junmenling.

Our army, with the assistance of the air force, bravely advanced, gradually resolving the bandits. They fled in a panic towards Luotian Qingxi. At 5:00 PM, Lian Dangsheng's regiment of the Seventh Division broke through the strong Junmenling and occupied it. In this battle, more than twenty bandit bunkers were destroyed, more than five hundred bandits were killed or wounded, one regimental chief of staff and one regimental instructor, and more than three hundred bandits were captured. The 7th and 8th Divisions seized more than two hundred good guns. The bandits lost their courage and dared not look back. Our army is now cleaning up the battlefield and searching for the remaining bandits. I respectfully report, your subordinate, Zeng Qiqing, respectfully. " (April 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e125">Northwest Inspection Notes - Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya - The Garrison Cultivation in the Sui Area and the Baotou Industry <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>"The Yellow River has hundreds of harms, but the sole benefit is the Hetao." Everyone knows that the Hetao area has fertile soil and abundant water resources. However, the Sui District Garrison Cultivation Supervisory Office is the only organization that is actually engaged in planned and large-scale reclamation. Under the goal of "stationing troops for farming, developing the Northwest, and consolidating the border," the "soldier cultivation" that is actively being carried out has achieved commendable results and has the greatest hope. The Sui West Garrison Cultivation only began work in the last two or three years. Last year, a total of 1,300 hectares of land were reclaimed. This year, it is estimated that at least 1,700 hectares of land can be reclaimed. After three years of reclamation, there will definitely be huge harvests, and the results will be even more amazing. This can be known without divination. The Sui District Garrison Cultivation Committee is located in Taiyuan, and the Garrison Cultivation Supervisory Office is in Baotou. Yan Xishan, Director of the Jin-Sui Pacification, concurrently serves as the Supervisor. Zhang Yinwu, former Mayor of Beijing, Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan, and Wang Jingguo, Commander of the 70th Division, are the co-organizers, and Shi Huayan is the office manager. Yesterday, I visited the office and was received by Secretary Li Ganqing and Section Chief Liu Chao, who gave a detailed account of the general situation of land reclamation, as follows:</p>
<p>In the spring of the 20th year, Wang Jingguo, Commander of the 70th Division, led more than 80 demobilized officers and soldiers to form a reclamation team and purchased dozens of hectares of land in Wuyuan to cultivate. This was the initial step in the pilot soldier cultivation. The income from one year of cultivation was more than enough to maintain their lives. The officers and soldiers became more interested in their work. The following spring, they received the sympathy of Fu Zuoyi, Li Shumin, Shi Huayan, and others. Each division of the 70th, 72nd, and 73rd divisions allocated a company of soldiers, called the Pilot Soldier Cultivation Team, and established a Reclamation Joint Office, searching for more than 300 hectares of land in Linhe. In addition to cultivation, they also engaged in canal excavation, fortification construction, and new village construction. After the September 18th Incident, Director Yan made a comeback and was determined to "save the country through production," believing that only by devoting himself to productive enterprises could he save the country from peril. He then formed a Military Officer Garrison Cultivation Team with 500 demobilized military officers and established a Soldier Cultivation Pilot Office in Baotou, which carried out cultivation in Wuyuan. Later, the Sui District Reclamation Committee and the Supervisory Office were also established in Taiyuan and Baotou in the summer of the 21st year. The work implementation plan is divided into three phases. July to October of the same year is the investigation period. All land surveys, terrain measurements, and soil, product, and farming habit surveys have been implemented in groups. October to the following year (22nd year) February is the preparation period, that is, handling the dredging of river channels, purchasing agricultural tools, making cattle tools, seeds, and building materials. In the spring of the same year, three regiments of soldiers began cultivation. The autumn harvest was the pilot period, and at the same time, new villages were established, cooperation was promoted, and animal husbandry, afforestation, and road construction were carried out. A total of 1,300 hectares of land were reclaimed. Although it was the initial stage and there were natural disasters and wars, the harvest was not abundant, but it can be said that the pilot was successful. Therefore, this year, the scope was expanded and officially held, and entered the garrison cultivation implementation period. Everything is already on track, and progress is more convenient. It is planned to reclaim 1,700 hectares of land, which is not difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen keenly realized the danger that China had too many soldiers and no way to manage them, and advocated the soldier industry policy, advocating troop reductions. Now, Sui West is implementing garrison cultivation, turning soldiers into farmers. How will the future success be? Let's put it aside for now. However, at present, it can reduce the number of soldiers, make them manageable, transform unproductive people into productive people, "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha immediately." The success of the soldier cultivation policy is not only in its results.</p>
<p>Baotou's industry has never been developed. There are only two machine factories, both producing flour. One of them is the Electrical Appliance Flour Company, which also operates the city's electricity, and is relatively large in scale. I heard that Duan Shengwu, the responsible committee member of the company, is enthusiastic about Baotou's social welfare and the development of the Northwest. I made a special visit and received a warm reception. According to him, the company's capital is 300,000 yuan. It did not make a profit in the first three years, but now it is gradually showing good signs. There are a total of 100 employees. The highest wage for workers is 70 yuan, and the lowest is 20 yuan. Trainees receive 10 yuan. They can also study in their spare time. With such treatment, there have never been any labor disputes. The daily output of flour is 500 bags, each bag weighing 49 pounds. With the power of machines, 900 bags can be produced day and night, but there is no such consumption volume yet.</p>
<p>Duan was originally a division commander in Feng Yuxiang's army. Because he realized that "it is not a good way for Chinese soldiers not to be engaged in a profession," he resolutely broke away from military affairs and came here to devote himself to industry. In addition to operating the Electrical Appliance Flour Company, he also used his spare time to engage in three meaningful tasks: (1) Studying the Yellow River and piloting boat trips. The waterway between Baotou and Ningxia has been measured and a report has been written. It is believed that the Yellow River situation in Baoxi is comparable to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and can be used for boat trips. Preparations for boat trips are now being made. (2) Studying the agricultural situation in Hetao. Chinese people have failed in operating agriculture in Hetao one after another. There are more than 20 groups. The root cause is not the lack of land, labor, and capital conditions, but the responsible managers are selfish and harm things (examples are omitted due to space limitations). In order to understand the rural situation, he often goes to the countryside to conduct field investigations. (3) Organizing the Northwest Industry Mutual Aid Society. The purpose is to connect comrades who study practical problems in the Northwest, exchange knowledge, develop a spirit of mutual assistance, and jointly seek improvements in Northwest industry. Duan is amiable and simple. Few people who see him for the first time can recognize that he was once a soldier.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing, a member of the Central Committee, and An, a section chief of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, went to Wuyuan and Linhe to inspect the reclaimed land and returned to Baotou. They met with Mr. Duan Shengwu one after another. Several people who knew the situation in Hetao well were also present, and they talked freely about various situations as follows:</p>
<p>The soil in Hetao is as fine as flour. It is a pity that most of it has not been developed, and the land is abandoned. According to regulations, the purchase of Mongolian land should be handled by the Suiyuan Reclamation Bureau. However, ordinary land speculators take shortcuts, secretly give gifts and pay money to Mongolians, and arbitrarily purchase large areas, waiting for the price to sell, and still leave them barren. Last year's investigation showed that landlords owned large tracts of land, even up to 4,000 hectares. Some of the land is virgin land, and some is wasteland. When asked about the landlords, they are still far away in Tianjin and Peiping.</p>
<p>The land price is extremely low. Ordinary ocean coins can buy one hectare of land for 100 yuan. It may be difficult to get even one mu of land in other places. The highest price for each hectare in the area reclaimed by the Sui West Garrison Cultivation Supervisory Office is 120 yuan, the lowest is 60 yuan, and the average is 80 yuan. Once sold, the Reclamation Bureau and the Mongolian landlords each get 35%, and the remaining 30% is reserved for the Baotou office. Since the soil in Hetao is good and the land price is low, the number of barren land is increasing day by day. The reasons are very complicated. The main reason is the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies. The tax collection here is unique. There is a so-called "measuring green to collect taxes," which means that taxes are collected if it is planted, otherwise it is not collected. The tax collection standards are difficult to determine clearly, and the collectors always manipulate it and exploit the people. In addition to paying the measuring green tax, farmers also have to pay various additional taxes that come with the occasion, such as the Qingmiao tax in Guyuan, which is as high as 70 yuan per hectare. Therefore, many farmers abandon their fields and disperse in all directions. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e127">Anhui Province's New Budget Approved - Income and Expenditure Fall Short by 500,000 Yuan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: Anhui Province's budget for the 23rd year was recently compiled by the Department of Finance, submitted to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government for revision and approval, and reported to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui for review. It can be implemented once approved. The financial situation of Anhui Province has been in deficit for many years. The compilation of this new budget is not without hesitation. For example, it is difficult to abolish the organizations that existed last year. The only way is to set the standard that it does not exceed last year's budget. After repeated reductions by the competent authorities for the original plan, the total income and expenditure fall short by about 300,000 yuan. There are also debts due in the 22nd year, which should be repaid, about 200,000 yuan. The two together exceed 500,000 yuan. The income is a total of 1,040,000 yuan. The reliable funds are about 900,000 yuan in this province and 120,000 yuan in central coordination. Most of the rest is unreliable. Last year's expenditure was 1,080,000 yuan, and this year's expenditure is 1,130,000 yuan. In terms of the budget, there is a shortfall of 500,000 yuan, but in fact, there is a shortfall of more than 1,000,000 yuan. In addition, the expenses owed by various agencies recently have been about three months or more, and another 1,000,000 yuan is needed. If next year's budget is about 1,000,000 yuan longer, it can make up for last year's losses, and it can be said that income and expenditure are suitable. Otherwise, the new and old losses will be more than 2,000,000 yuan. It is difficult to rely on the central government to make up for this loss. The Department of Finance is now planning to deal with this difficult situation. In terms of expenditure, the new ones, non-essential uses, should be slowed down, and the old ones that can be reduced should be severely reduced, so that future income can make up for previous losses.

<h3 id="e128">The Hengzhou Station of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Starts Construction <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Hengyang News: The Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway project has been progressing rapidly recently. In addition to the extension of construction from both the north and south ends, the route has many large tunnels in the south and three major bridge projects, namely Yuan, Mi, and Lei Rivers in the north. The project is arduous. If we wait for the two ends to extend sequentially, it will delay the project. Therefore, the route south of Hengzhou was also approved by the Ministry of Railways and started construction ahead of schedule, forming a situation of three-sided simultaneous construction. A ceremony was held at the Caijiayuan station site on April 23 to commemorate the start of construction of the Hengzhou Station. People from all walks of life were invited to participate. On that day, there were dozens of representatives from Hengyang's military and political leaders, gentry, banks, and the press, as well as three to four thousand local people who participated freely, which was extremely grand. After playing music and setting off firecrackers, Director Ling presided over the meeting, performed the etiquette, and reported to the public on the construction of Hengzhou Station. Wen Bin, the magistrate of Hengyang County, and others gave speeches, giving deep support and encouragement. Then the groundbreaking ceremony was held, photos were taken and firecrackers were set off, and military music was melodious. That night, the bureau thanked the guests with a banquet and dispersed happily. The report of Director Zhou Ling of Zhuzhou-Shaoguan is recorded below: The Guangdong-Hankou Railway has been under discussion for nearly forty years since its initial proposal. It has gone through many twists and turns. The Guangzhou-Shaoguan section was completed in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and the Wuchang-Changsha section was completed in the seventh year of the Republic of China, and connected to the Zhuzhou section in the middle. The Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section, more than 450 kilometers in the middle, was suspended for more than ten years, and no one in our country did not look forward to the early completion of this road day and night. Among them, those who looked forward to it the most should be the people of Hunan and Guangdong provinces, and among the people of the two provinces, those who must be leading the way are our Heng people, which is beyond doubt. The reason why this road has been suspended for a long time is that the lack of an overall economic plan is the biggest reason. Fortunately, the central government has made the greatest determination to complete this road, and borrowed most of the British Gengkuan funds to complete it in four years. In order to speed up the construction, the bureau moved to Hengzhou from Guangzhou last autumn to coordinate the response. Now, in addition to the extension of construction from both ends, we are also simultaneously advancing southward from Hengzhou, with three sides starting at the same time, so as not to miss the government's deadline. The plan to start work in Heng has been realized today. Although the project held today is small, it is also a memorable event in the progress of the road construction of this road, and it is also a comfort to the desire of our Heng people. Hengzhou is located in the center of this road, about 542 kilometers south of Guangzhou and about 550 kilometers north of Wuchang. It is the hub of north-south transportation and an important commercial port in central Hunan. In the future, it will be celebrated that the branch line will be completed and the Hong-Gui Highway will be extended, then the traffic between Guizhou and Guangxi provinces and the mainland of the Yangtze River, and the exchange of special products from various provinces, will all gather here. Therefore, Hengzhou Station occupies the most important position in the entire line. Although it is temporarily listed as a second-class station, it may develop into a first-class station in the future. In the early stage of the creation, we can't help but look a little further ahead to avoid difficulties in the future. Therefore, the selection of the location, the layout of the station and all equipment, are all aimed at developing commerce and facilitating travel, and are carefully studied before being submitted to the Ministry for approval. As for the detailed situation in the station, a booklet has been compiled separately, describing the station planning, site selection equipment and the use of land and other items, and distributed to all walks of life for reference, which will not be repeated here. The Ministry of Railways recently believes that the relationship of this road is extremely important and is making every effort to allocate funds to allow the road to be completed slightly ahead of schedule. Also, because the pound price has fallen, the current fund portion of Gengkuan has been greatly affected. The Bureau was ordered to make the most stringent plan, with the principle of first connecting the rails and then supplementing the equipment. Our bureau is now implementing all construction projects in accordance with this principle, with the goal of connecting the rails by the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China, and the construction aspects are seeking to have a solid and permanent road. As for the completeness of the equipment, it still needs to wait until after the opening of the road, so that the road can be connected as soon as possible with the limited funds. The colleagues of the Bureau feel that they bear a heavy responsibility and are deeply afraid of overstepping. Mutual assistance and support are waiting to be clarified. Today, in the opening ceremony, what makes us deeply uneasy is the matter of using civilian land and moving graves and demolishing houses. This matter was deeply concerned at the beginning of the Bureau's design, and efforts were made to minimize the impact on the people and minimize the relocation of graves and the demolition of houses. However, because Jiangdong Town is close to Heng City, the loss is inevitable. Judging from our country's old ideas, the colleagues of the Bureau are extremely sorry, but the railway is ultimately a major national transportation plan, and it is inevitable to achieve public needs with a small number of inconveniences. The Bureau is now repeatedly urging the prudent handling of all the land and mu collected this time for public affairs, and giving preferential land prices, and issuing cash immediately. For those who are requisitioned land, before the actual requisition, the landowners without contracts will be notified in advance to pay the price, and the local government will be proved to be exempt from tax to alleviate the people's difficulties, in order to reduce the pain to the least possible in the inevitable sacrifice. The Bureau has never been deeply sympathetic to those who are requisitioned for fields and houses due to road construction. Today's ceremony is over, and we will invite all the guests to hold the groundbreaking ceremony, and then the construction will officially start. I deeply hope that the road construction of this road can proceed smoothly with the blessing of all of you, and especially hope that you will not hesitate to teach us in the future and use it to correct our mistakes. Please forgive me for the inadequate reception today.</p>

<p>The Songsi Xin Da Ferry, operated by Ma Abba, arrived in Songjiang from Si on the afternoon of April 25. On the way, near Jiuliting, a member of the Second Squadron of the Water Police Department boarded the ship in plain clothes. When the ship arrived at Wulitang, the plainclothes water police suddenly blew a whistle and forced the captain to stop. At the same time, many water police officers from the department, who had been prepared on the shore, each took out a box gun and forced the ship to shore. The passengers dispersed in shock. After a while, a small package of so-called red pills was found in the passenger cabin. Without asking the reason, the captain Dong Changming and the tugboat operator Jin Ayou were immediately detained and escorted to the Songjiang team headquarters for torture. Dong Changming and others were injured and have filed a complaint with the Songjiang County Court Prosecutor's Office for questioning. Unexpectedly, in the early morning of the 30th, the department sent its armed personnel to Si again, robbed the Xin Da Ferry, and arrested three crew members. That afternoon, the department sent its personnel to Si again, intending to rob and detain the Xu Si Ban De Ferry, because the ship was also operated by Ma Abba. People in Si were very unhappy. Later, various local agencies came forward to intervene and stop it, which avoided a city-wide strike.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, more than ten bandits from the 13th District of Nantong sneaked into Changchun Town, the 5th District of this county, intending to cause disturbances. After receiving the news, the county government immediately dispatched the deputy leader of the security corps, Cai Yunshan, and the police captain, Cheng Rusong, to lead a team to defend and suppress them. By the time they arrived at the town, the bandits had already scattered upon hearing the news. They then searched the surrounding villages but found nothing.

<p>Lu Chongpeng, the "Red Pill King" of this county, on January 31st of last year, transported a large quantity of red pills from Fuan Town in the 9th District to the county. While passing in front of the Farmers' Education Center in Sanyang Town, 6th District, he was discovered by members of the 6th District Corps and sent to the district headquarters for investigation. However, Gu Tianming, the leader of the district corps, colluded with Yang Zuoyuan, the director of corps affairs, and released both the person and the goods after receiving a bribe. The incident was uncovered by the Jianghai Daily, which first reported it, attracting the attention of people throughout the county. After the county party headquarters sent personnel to investigate and confirm the facts, and after representatives of the people of the 6th District, such as Shi Zhili, filed a complaint with the county government, Lu Chongpeng, Gu Tianming, and Yang Zuoyuan were repeatedly summoned by the county, but they refused to appear in court. Subsequently, Gu and Yang were dismissed from their positions by the Provincial Security Committee for failing to properly handle security (Yang is now working for the tax police in Chongming, and Gu is working as a section member in the Liyang County government), resulting in the case remaining unresolved. The county government has now scheduled a continuation of the trial on May 12th and has already signed warrants ordering the police to strictly arrest Lu, Gu, and Yang and bring them to justice for interrogation. The situation is quite serious.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Bao learned that internal and external staff of the field tax office had colluded in fraud, using the "flying string" method to embezzle five or six tens of thousands of yuan in grain taxes. On the 30th, he specifically ordered Chen Ruizhang, the director of the field tax office, to report the 20th and 21st year's string numbers and balances for investigation. He also secretly ordered Police Chief Wu Bowen to arrest Qu Yongkang, Qu Shaopeng, and Yu Shaozhen, suspected of being major outside collaborators, and Jiang Jiuyu (i.e., Guoji), an internal collaborator. County Magistrate Bao interrogated Qu Yongkang and others in the inner room in the morning. Qu Yongkang and others firmly denied providing any conclusive information. Initially, he intended to detain them, but after Qu and others requested it, they found reliable shop guarantees to be released and available whenever summoned. This case has stirred up a storm in the city. It remains to be seen whether County Magistrate Bao can thoroughly investigate it.</p>

<p>Gui Xiangcun Teashop, located at No. 1 East Street, Dashiqiao Tuen, in the city, has been open for more than ten years. The owner, Li Pan'gen, has quite a bit of savings. He has a son named Shengshi, who is thirteen years old and attends Peixin Elementary School. Unexpectedly, on March 11th, 14th, and April 21st (Gregorian calendar), Pan'gen suddenly received three threatening letters signed by Zhang Jingqiao, a Communist Wu Xuexia, demanding 100 silver dollars and instructing him to wrap the money in black paper and place it in the broken wall hole of the Lingguan Temple on April 30th; otherwise, Shengshi would be killed. Li was shocked upon receiving the letter and immediately discussed it with Gu Renquan, who lived to the west of his house. On that day, they purchased 150 yuan of counterfeit banknotes from Yantong Bank and attached a letter, advising him to repent. They placed them together in the broken wall hole of the Lingguan Temple. At the same time, they agreed with Gu Renquan and others to wait nearby. At around 2:00 AM, someone went to retrieve the money and was immediately captured. Upon inspection, it was found to be Pan Da, the son of Yang Shunshi, the owner of Yang Yuqi Paint Shop at No. 54 nearby. Subsequently, one person who was keeping watch nearby was also arrested, who turned out to be Han Chang (also known as A'er), the son of Yang Zibin, the owner of Yang Yuanxing Paint Shop at No. 55, and Pan Da's cousin. Li Pan'gen was extremely surprised to see this, as they were all long-time neighbors. He wondered why they had done this. Considering that they were ignorant and had accidentally gone astray, he felt that there were extenuating circumstances, so he did not intend to investigate further. However, the matter had already been learned by the detectives Wang Shuanglin, Xu Kunsheng, and Zhang Biao of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, who took Yang Pan Da and Yang Han Chang brothers to the bureau for questioning. After being interrogated by Wu, a section member, they were transferred to the local court's prosecutor's office yesterday. After the prosecutor, Ren, opened a court for interrogation, he ordered Yang Pan Da and Yang Han Chang to be detained. The plaintiff, Li Pan'gen, and others were ordered to return home and await further action.</p>

<p>Director Zhou Fohai of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, accompanied by Section Chiefs Xiang Jutan, Chen Xifang, Editing Director Yi Junzuo, and General Affairs Director Tian Yuelong, came to Wuxi on the 30th of last month to inspect the educational situation. On the 1st of this month, Mr. Zhou diligently traveled to the city and countryside to inspect the Educational Institute and the Huibei Experimental District, the Beixia Experimental District's first branch, and then went to inspect Dongting Elementary School, the Beixia District Headquarters, and Nanqian Elementary School. On the morning of the 2nd, Mr. Zhou departed from the Educational Institute and rushed to inspect the Provincial Wuxi Normal School, the National Studies Training Institute, and the County Junior High School. Finally, guided by Director Zang of the Education Bureau and others, he went to inspect the Jingzhi Girls' School in Beichan Temple Alley, the Ximen Public Sports Field, Mianhua Lane Elementary School, and Huishan Elementary School, and gave instructions to each school. That evening, he convened a meeting of all faculty and staff at the Provincial Normal School auditorium, stating briefly that in terms of moral education, a person's knowledge and character are equally important. Many people have high intelligence, but their character has many flaws, which is the main reason for the failure of Chinese education. In the future, special attention should be paid to moral education. Teachers should treat students like their own children, with the heart of a loving mother and the methods of a strict father. This is the best model for moral education. In terms of educational affairs, junior high schools should follow the rules and progress step by step, and senior high schools should pay attention to practical work, etc. Yesterday (the 3rd), Mr. Zhou inspected the County Library, the Mass Education Center, the Central Elementary School, the County Girls' Junior High School, and the County First and Second schools, etc., and is scheduled to go to Luoshe today to inspect the Rural Teachers' School.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department believes that the completion of the Liutang River is of great importance to the farmland in northern Jiangsu. Since the start of construction in January of this year, they have been actively proceeding and sparing no effort. Sections of the project have either been fully completed or are 80-90% completed. However, the Donghai and Guanyun sections were initially delayed due to the county magistrate's lack of effort in conscripting labor, and the provincial government has already dismissed him and ordered the newly appointed county magistrate to oversee and urge the work to facilitate progress. Furthermore, because the Liu Guitang bandit gang harassed Ganyu, the defenses north of Dongguan were strained, and the project was again delayed. Recently, in the Donghai area, the construction of the embankment has been largely completed, and the excavation work is also progressing rapidly and will likely be completed on schedule. However, the Guanyun section is located downstream of the entire project. If it cannot be completed at the same time, the middle reaches will be affected, which is of great importance to the entire project. In order to take the entire project into account, the Liutang River Project Office has transferred the Lianshui labor force to help Guanyun first excavate the downstream area. After the downstream excavation is completed, they will jointly excavate the riverbed in the Lianshui section. At this critical juncture, in order to ensure the project's success, the Construction Department has dispatched Xiao Kaiying, the section chief of the First Section in charge of water conservancy, to conduct an inspection and provide guidance on everything, in order to ensure smooth completion.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Yangzhou: Salt Workers in Twelve Forts Petition <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Through the suggestions and arrangements of Salt Commissioner Miao, the salt transport of Lianghuai, regarding the salt transport to Hunan, Hubei, Western Anhui and other coasts, will gradually be changed from sailing transport to steamship transport, so that the salt of all provinces can reduce freight costs and reach the coast quickly. Therefore, the lives of more than 100,000 sailing transport workers and sailors in the Twelve Forts of Yizheng have become insecure, and they are extremely panicked. Representatives were previously elected and repeatedly appealed to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Affairs Administration, and the Nanchang Chiang Kai-shek's Headquarters, but no satisfactory results were obtained. As a result, 600-700 sailships that could be transported were accumulated in the Twelve Forts, which also had a great impact on the market in the fort. The provincial government also believes that the salt transport favors steamship transport, and the loss of employment for sailing transport workers and the lack of food is having a great impact on local security and social economy. It should maintain the proportion of 5 steamships and 8 sailships, and at the 653rd provincial government meeting, Commissioner Wang Bailing was sent to Beijing to contact the Ministry of Finance. After hearing the news, the fort residents specially sent representatives from the 18 gangs of workers and sailors to Yangzhou to visit Commissioner Wang through the introduction of Bao Xiangzhong, a fellow villager in Yangzhou, to state the situation of unemployment of sailships, and that sail transport does not hinder public tax revenue, merchants' capital, etc., and asked them to convey the suffering and argue on the basis of reason. Commissioner Wang has agreed to forward the matter to the capital.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Planning to Open Sichuan-Tibet Route: Shanghai-Guangdong Route Resumption Pending; Search for Missing Aircraft Abandoned <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the China National Aviation Corporation's original Shanghai-Guangdong route has been suspended for almost a month since the disappearance of the No. 17 Sikorsky aircraft. The No. 40 aircraft that went to search for it was also damaged by wind and waves and sent to Shanghai for repairs. Although parts of the missing No. 17 aircraft have been recovered from the sea in recent days, it is not certain that it crashed into the sea, so the search has been temporarily abandoned. Yesterday, there was news that the company was planning to open a Sichuan-Tibet route. The reporter specifically inquired about the details. What was said was quite detailed, and it is urgently recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Southwest Route Trial Flight Successful <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Reportedly, in November of last year, the company sent Nie Kaiyi, the director of the aviation group, along with pilot An Lisheng, to depart from Hankou, pass through Changsha, Guangzhou, Longzhou, and Kunming, and return to Chongqing, in order to open up air transport between Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, and the two Guangdongs. After Longzhou, due to accidentally landing in Annam, they were once detained by the French authorities. After requesting release by telegram, they were able to fly safely to Yunnan. It was supposed to be officially opened to navigation on a specific date, but due to funding issues, it has been delayed until now, and there is still no concrete plan. The exact date of the opening is currently uncertain.</p>

<p>The Sichuan-Tibet route is being planned by the company upon the order of the Ministry of Communications. It involves aviation from Sichuan to Lhasa, Tibet. It is believed that there are many mountains and ridges in these two places, making flying quite difficult. Therefore, the section from Sichuan via Badong to Kangding is being opened first. The airports in both places have been telegraphed by the Ministry of Communications to Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui to be built on their behalf. A reply has been received agreeing to do so. As soon as funding is available, trial flights can begin.</p>

<p>The original Shanghai-Guangdong route, due to the disappearance of the No. 17 aircraft and the damage to the No. 40 aircraft, which was sent to Shanghai for repairs, will resume flying as soon as it is completed. As for the two new aircraft that were ordered from the United States, they will not arrive until two months later. It is expected that the route can be resumed in half a month.</p>

<p>As for the missing No. 17 aircraft, although remains of the aircraft have been discovered successively last month, the bodies have not been recovered to date. It is unknown whether they have any effect. The families of the passengers and pilots have also not made any representations to the company. In recent days, due to the search for the aircraft, the company has suffered considerable losses. It has now decided to abandon the search and wait for the truth to come out.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Huang Jintao to Sail to Europe on the 6th: Discussing the Mission and Purpose of the Inspection (Four Items) <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Huang Jintao, the Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry, who has been appointed to go to Europe and the United States to inspect mining and steel matters, is scheduled to depart on the Empress of Canada on the 6th. According to him, the mission and purpose of his trip to Europe and the United States can be divided into four items: 1. To investigate the plant price of the proposed state-owned central steel plant; 2. To investigate the aluminum manufacturing industry. To investigate the evolution of the human race, which has evolved from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Steel Age. But now the Steel Age is about to shift to the Aluminum Age. The Altmiune aluminum manufacturing industry is a new industry. Aluminum has many uses and has now partially replaced the position of steel. For example, most household appliances are made of pure aluminum because they are light and do not rust. As for freight cars, some are now made of aluminum alloys, whose strength is equal to that of steel, but they are two-thirds lighter than steel. Also, for building houses, manufacturing automobiles, and airplane wings, as well as daily furniture and utensils, Duralumin, an aluminum alloy, is used because it is light and has the same strength as steel. The world's major iron ore mines have been developed, and they are being used very quickly. China's iron ore is especially not abundant. Therefore, it is currently urgent for our country to revitalize the aluminum manufacturing industry. The Ministry of Industry has designated Shandong's abundant aluminum mines as a reserve area. Therefore, he is specifically investigating the aluminum manufacturing industries of various countries in order to formulate our country's aluminum manufacturing plan. 3. To investigate the industry of extracting gasoline from brown ash. China's oil reserves are limited, and the expansion of highways in recent years has made it necessary to strive for self-sufficiency in gasoline, otherwise the leakage will be very large. Currently, most countries extract gasoline from brown ash by low-temperature distillation. It is urgently necessary for our country to follow suit. Therefore, an investigation must be conducted and a plan for implementation must be formulated. 4. To investigate the industry of extracting gasoline from coal using light chemical hydrogenation. Our country's oil fields are not abundant. Unless various methods are used to extract gasoline or other oil materials, we cannot be self-sufficient. Germany currently has new factories using light chemical hydrogenation to extract gasoline from coal. This must also be investigated incidentally in order to implement it in our country. It is said that Mr. Huang's inspection will take about four months, and he will return to the country immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Ministry of Industry Subsidizes Domestic Coal: Will Reduce Costs and Freight for Mine Owners <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in response to the decline of the domestic coal market, a relief measure was implemented in October of last year to increase the import tax on foreign coal. The impact of the tax increase is enough to prevent Japanese coal from being dumped again. According to those familiar with the coal market, Japanese coal sales this year have decreased by one-tenth compared to before October of last year. Kailuan coal took the opportunity to develop. Because its sales in the Northeast are very small, it is urgently promoting sales in Guannei. Kailuan coal has lower costs and freight than domestic coal, so it is easy to occupy the market. As a result, domestic coal has lower production and higher costs, making it unable to compete, and its future is becoming increasingly precarious. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry held a meeting to discuss relief measures, and has sent personnel to Henan Province to investigate coal production conditions, try to reduce costs for mine owners, and will negotiate with the Ministry of Railways to reduce freight in order to provide relief.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Assigns Engineer Trainees</p>
<h3 id="e157">Scheduled to Sail to England: Six to Depart on the 20th of This Month <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is using Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds to build four ocean-going vessels, which have been named Haiyuan, Haiting, Haili, and Haizhen, etc. As the first vessel is scheduled to be completed in September and come to Shanghai to operate on the South China route, the company has specifically sent Captain Ma Jiajun, Teng Shibiao, Technician Huang Zonglun, Chief Engineer Zhang Guoquan, and two junior third engineers, and two students from the Wusong Merchant Marine School to England to practice driving and engine management, etc. The company had submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications for instructions. It was originally planned to sail to Europe in early April, but because the Ministry's order had not been issued for a long time, the members were unable to depart. The Ministry's approval was only received the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Six members will depart first. The six members of the company's delegation to England include naval technologist Huang Zonglun, chief engineer Zhang Guoquan from Jiahe ship, and two second-class apprentice engineers Li Changwen and Shi Ruichang, as well as two students from the Marine Engineering Department of Wusong College. The captains Ma and Teng will go to England in July to take over the ships. The Ministry has approved the company's overseas procedures, and the necessary travel expenses have been readied for those six members, totaling 30,000+ yuan. All six members were notified the day before yesterday from the marine department to prepare everything before their sailing overseas. The company marine department and the crew leaving for England for practical training are scheduled to leave this month, because each of the crew has duties to be done, and it has been ordered that they quickly tie up all loose ends and come to an end. At the same time, a letter has been sent to Wusong Commercial Vessel School, asking that they present the list of two selected trainees to the company, so that tickets and the like can be processed. After consultation, it was decided that they would depart from Shanghai on the twentieth of this month, and a telegram has been sent to England to notify Wu Daming and Shi Gan to notify the shipyard, so that they can contact them in advance.</p>

<p>After the Philippine Independence Bill Passes</p>
<h3 id="e159">Restrictions on Filipinos Visiting the United States <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, the Philippine Parliament accepted the bill passed by the U.S. Congress allowing the Philippines to become independent within ten to twelve years on Thursday. The bill stipulates that Filipinos entering the United States must be subject to the same restrictions as other foreigners, with an annual quota of only fifty people. Once the bill is passed in Manila, it must be implemented immediately. When the President Hoover sailed to the United States, there were 160 Filipino passengers on board. Whether U.S. immigration officials can allow them to land in San Francisco is a serious issue. Public opinion may not be lenient enough to let them go.</p>

<p>According to news from the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office in this city, the eighth International Petroleum Exposition will be held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, from May 12th to 19th of this year. The first session was held in 1923. Its scale is unparalleled among industrial exhibitions in the United States, and perhaps not many can match it in the world. The U.S. government has already issued formal invitations from the State Department to foreign governments to participate as scheduled. The International Petroleum Exposition is not for profit. Its mission is entirely to promote the interests of the industry. When the meeting was held in 1930, 1,500 petroleum companies from various places participated, and 150,000 people visited during the eight days of public exhibition. The U.S. Congress has passed resolutions four times, authorizing the Secretary of State to invite the 48 states of the United States and friendly nations to participate. This year, it will be held as usual. At the 1930 exhibition, 73 representatives from 21 countries traveled from afar to attend. The exhibition items of this conference will cover all aspects related to the production, transportation, refining, and sales of petroleum. The "Science and Technology Committee" of the conference will also publicly display various scientific instruments and specimens to arouse the interest of petroleum merchants and the public. The content of the petroleum industry is vast, with countless branches and ramifications. Anyone who wants to get a glimpse of the entire industry in a short time should not miss this excellent opportunity.</p>

<p>The Taxation Administration responded to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Regarding your letter Shangzi No. 854, which relayed a letter from the San Shan Fu Ning Guild Hall in Shanghai North, stating that wheat flour shipped to Fujian was subject to re-collection of duties. A total of 42,700 bags of flour were involved. Due to the military transportation disruptions in northern and western Fujian and the difficulty of mailing, the documents could not be submitted to the department within the stipulated tax refund period. They applied for a tax refund, and now they submit overdue documents, requesting that you forward the request for approval and extend the deadline for three months to allow for the gradual submission of applications for tax refunds, etc., requesting verification and processing, along with the attached list of documents. This case was previously submitted by the Shanghai Machine-Made Flour Manufacturers Association with the same request, and a reply was sent stating that the matter concerned a general case and could not be approved. It should have been handled according to the original case to maintain uniformity. However, considering the Fujian Incident, which was a special circumstance, the stated reasons for the delay were not without merit. In view of the consideration for merchants, this department will make an exception this time. Starting from the date of receipt of the documents by this department, the 24,700 bags of flour that were overdue for less than one month will be approved for delivery to the Fuzhou Consolidated Tax Administration for verification and refund. The remaining 18,000 bags of flour, which were overdue for more than one month, should be excluded and will not be refunded. If there are any requests for refunds in the future, they should still be handled in accordance with the regulations and should not be used as precedents to avoid disputes. The previous request is approved. In addition to instructing the Fuzhou Administration to verify and reply, the remaining documents are returned with this letter for your reference and notification."</p>

<p>With the cocoon season approaching, silk merchants everywhere are actively preparing to purchase cocoons. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are the main cocoon-producing areas in China. The Sericulture Management Improvement Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Construction has specially formulated thirteen articles of regulations on silk cocoon guilds and ordered them to be implemented in various counties. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency has learned the gist of the regulations from silk organizations as follows: The Jiangsu Sericulture Management Improvement Committee believes that merchants' applications for cocoon licenses are not accurate. Therefore, those with licenses but without stoves (for drying cocoons) will have their licenses revoked, and those with stoves but without licenses will be ordered to close. Those who report less than they have or more than they have will be investigated. It is also stipulated that Wuxi and other counties will be designated as model areas, and all cocoon guilds must switch to using cocoon drying machines, which must be implemented by May 1935. A registration fee of three yuan will be collected for each dan (unit of weight) of dried cocoons, and twelve yuan will be charged for silkworm eggs and for improving the sericulture industry. As for the silk merchants in this city, they will schedule a meeting to discuss cocoon purchases.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Responds to the Pilot Association</p>
<h3 id="e168">Explanation of the Recovery of Pilotage Rights: Misunderstandings in the Pilot Association's Statements <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Shanghai Pilot Association, stating that the recent establishment of a pilotage management committee by the Chinese government conflicted with the association's vested rights. To protect its own interests, the association requested three matters from the government and asked the chamber of commerce to forward them to the government for assistance. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that there are some misunderstandings in the association's statements and has responded with a letter explaining the significance of recovering pilotage rights. The following is an excerpt of the original text: "The use of native pilots is a common practice in all countries of the world. Although the nationalities of your association's members are not uniform, if you carefully examine the methods practiced in your respective countries, you will know that this move is not an innovation of the Chinese government. Moreover, Article 8 of the recently promulgated regulations of the pilotage management committee stipulates that 'If there are not enough qualified pilots in a port to meet the pilotage quota, the pilotage management committee shall select experienced Chinese pilots and grant them practice certificates to serve on a trial basis.' Furthermore, the change to using Chinese pilots is limited to future vacancies and does not affect the business of your association's members. Therefore, while the Chinese government's legislation strives to conform to international practice, it also makes every effort to take care of the current situation and the interests of your association's members. If we criticize it from a third-party perspective, we would also say that this measure is extremely fair. As for your association's claim that there are no people familiar with port affairs on the Chinese side, and therefore we have to rely on foreigners, this is based on a document submitted by Robert Hart, the former Inspector General of Customs, to the Yamen (Foreign Affairs Office). This association believes that your association's judgment does not fully accord with the facts. Let's set that aside for now, but it must be known that the Chinese government is adopting a gradual approach in using native pilots, so qualified personnel can be gradually cultivated and be fully sufficient. Although the ships sailing in the ports now are not just from China, the goods they carry and the passengers they transport are mostly Chinese, and the interests of China are most affected. The Chinese government will not disregard the selection of pilots. However, these arguments do not seem to be the main points of your letter. Your association's main requests are three: (1) The pilotage management committee must be well-organized and highly disciplined, just like the former Marine Department. (2) The committee must truly understand the hardships and dangers of sailors. Although there is no responsibility on the part of the government or the committee to respond to these two points, we would like to tell your association from the perspective of this association that the committee is composed of one Customs Tax Commissioner, one Harbour Master, and one representative from the Harmony Chamber of Commerce, originally to make it easier to get things done, and it is easier for your association to contact them for requests. In addition, the Ministry of General Staff, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Communications, and this association each send a representative. These four representatives are all navigation experts. This association does not see anything unhealthy in its organization, nor does it see anything unclear about the hardships of sailors. The current isolation is due to your association's adherence to decades of established ideas and the failure of the Harmony Chamber of Commerce to send a representative. If Chinese and foreign personnel can gather together to discuss matters regularly, these doubts will naturally be dispelled. (3) The pilotage property rights should be protected. This association believes that although the Chinese government has always recovered its rightful sovereignty based on international conventions, it has never confiscated the property rights of foreigners or failed to protect them. Your association need not worry too much about this. Furthermore, in our opinion, your association can submit its requests to the management committee. If the committee does not respond to anything within its power, we can forward it to the government on your behalf. If you deny the existence of the committee and expect this association to help, then this association is not willing to comply. Addressed to the Shanghai Pilot Association."</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests an Explanation</p>
<h3 id="e170">Method of Re-Electing Alternate Committee Members of the Chamber of Commerce: Is a Re-Election Required Every Term? <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, requesting an explanation of the method of re-electing alternate committee members of the Chamber of Commerce. The original text reads: "Article 15 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law states that 'The Chamber of Commerce may, in accordance with its articles of association, elect alternate committee members when electing the Executive Committee or Supervisory Committee. When there is a vacancy, they shall be elected to fill the position in order of succession, and their term of office shall be limited to completing the term of the former member.' According to this provision, the alternate committee members should be re-elected at the same time each time the Chamber of Commerce holds an election, that is, when the law stipulates that half of the members should be re-elected every two years. Also, the term of office of alternate committee members is to complete the term of the former member. Therefore, alternate committee members themselves do not have a term of office until they are elected to fill a vacancy. The intention of the four-year term for the executive and supervisory committee members, with half of the members being re-elected every two years, is to mix new and old members so that they can handle matters smoothly. It does not seem applicable to alternate committee members, because alternate committee members do not hold a position until they are elected to fill a vacancy. Furthermore, the letter from the Judicial Yuan No. 913 to the Central People's Movement Committee in 1933 also states that 'According to the current law, there is no provision for re-electing half of the alternate executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, there is no need to re-elect them when the executive and supervisory committee members are re-elected by lottery for the first time.' According to this interpretation, it can also be considered that, except for the first lottery, the alternate committee members do not need to be re-elected along with the re-elected members. However, each time an election is held thereafter, the alternate committee members should be entirely re-elected, because the provisions of Article 15 of the Implementing Rules only state that alternate committee members should be re-elected, and do not mention the re-election of half of them. In fact, there are as many as seven alternate executive committee members and as many as three alternate supervisory committee members. If all of them are elected to fill vacancies within two years, then there is no reason to elect only half of them in the next election. Therefore, the legal text does not say 're-elect half of them,' but 're-elect,' precisely to avoid any obstruction. If the above statement is correct, then the half of the alternate executive and supervisory committee members who were re-elected in June 1932 due to the first lottery and re-election should also be re-elected together in this election. However, this matter concerns the election policy, and careful examination is necessary to seek details. For the sake of prudence, we have prepared a document and submitted it to your bureau for review and approval. This is for the public convenience."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications, after discovering that some telegraph personnel were holding concurrent jobs in privately-run radio stations and setting up private transceivers to seek personal gain, specially instructed the International Telegraph Administration to stop this practice. After receiving the order, the Administration immediately issued a notice stating: "It has long been prohibited for the administration's reporting staff to hold concurrent jobs in privately-run radio stations. However, as time passes, the rules have been violated. According to confidential reports, there are still a few telegraph operators holding concurrent jobs outside and setting up private transceivers to seek personal gain. They are given one week to voluntarily resign from their concurrent jobs. Otherwise, they will be dismissed and punished as soon as they are discovered. However, those who can accurately report the names of the above-mentioned people holding concurrent jobs will be rewarded with cash. If someone makes a false accusation out of spite, they will be severely punished upon verification and will not be spared. This is the notice."</p>

<p>Tenant Representatives of Peide Lane</p>
<h3 id="e173">Negotiated with the Water Company Again Yesterday: No Results After Several Hours of Negotiations <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Since the water was cut off in Peide Lane on Xin Zha Road, despite efforts to appeal to various parties, the water source has not been restored due to the insistence of the owner and the water company. Wang Xiangu, the lawyer representing the lane, received a reply letter from the water company yesterday that misinterpreted the sentences. He immediately sent another letter in reply and accompanied the tenant representatives to negotiate with the water company. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Not Allowed to Turn on the Water <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Wang Xiangu, the lawyer representing the lane, accompanied representatives Liu Chengyong, Chen Silong, Pan Sanquan, and three others to negotiate with the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company. The deputy manager, a Westerner named Walder, met them. Wang Xiangu translated the purpose of the visit, requesting the company to immediately send someone to turn on the water, and the water fee would be paid by the tenant representatives to avoid losses to the company. However, according to Walder, he was not allowed to turn on the water and could only do so if separate water meters were installed. However, the tenant representatives firmly refused to install separate meters until the water fees paid by the owner in the rent were refunded. After several hours of negotiations, there were still no results. Finally, the representatives stated that if the company did not fulfill its obligations under the treaty and did not turn on the water, the company would be fully responsible for any accidents that occurred as a result. The meeting ended unhappily.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Company Reply Letter <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company replied to the representing lawyer, Wang Xiangu, yesterday, stating: "In reply, we received your lawyer's letter on the 27th of this month, stating that you are providing water to the houses on Xin Zha Road and Da Tong Road, Tianzhutang. We understand. It has been verified that the owner of each house has accepted the conditions for installing separate meters in that location. He has requested our company to install the separate meters in accordance with the patent contract. Since the entire chapter has been accepted, the company should implement the installation of the separate meters in accordance with the terms of the patent contract with the Shanghai Municipal Council. The terms of the contract cited by your lawyer are not relevant to this matter, because the owner has accepted the various terms of the contract, so after the implementation, the owner has no responsibility for paying the fees. Even if the owner still has this responsibility, the company is free to stop supplying water, because the sentence in that clause states, 'It has not been determined whether the company can stop supplying water at the request of the landlord.' In view of the above situation, your lawyer can know that if the company continues to supply water, it will not be able to collect water fees from the landlord or the tenants. Therefore, after the failure of reconciliation, the supply will be stopped. However, in the opinion of the company, there is no reason why the installation of separate water meters is detrimental to the tenants. If the situation still wants to be discussed in detail, please ask your lawyer to inform the situation to come to our company to discuss everything in person. This is for lawyer Wang Xiangu. Secretary and Deputy Manager, Walder, opened."</p>
<h3 id="e176">Re: Letter to the Water Company <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the neighborhood again sent a letter to the Water Company, stating:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We have received your esteemed letter and immediately forwarded it to all tenants of Peide Lane, Xinzha Road, for their review. According to their response, the water supply for the tenants should be continued by the Water Company. This is clearly stated in the contract clauses between your company and the Public Works Department on March 17, 1928, specifically, "If the house is occupied, the Water Company shall not, at the request of the landlord, discontinue the water supply." It is difficult to accept your company's attempts to shirk responsibility. Moreover, your company previously sent a letter to a certain organization with real estate interests, based on the same contract, automatically declaring that if a house is occupied by tenants, the Water Company shall not comply with the landlord's request to cut off the water supply to all or part of the house, and that the outstanding water charges can be recovered from the landlord using the landlord's property as collateral. This shows that the Water Company was well aware of its obligation to supply water to the tenants and should strictly and consistently adhere to it, making it impossible to violate or undermine. In your reply, the Water Company quoted the phrase in the aforementioned contract clause, "Whether or not the company can stop at the request of the landlord is not fixed," (the original wording is actually that the Water Company shall not comply with the landlord's request to cut off the water supply), and should pay attention to the phrase "the house is occupied." It should be understood that the water supply is a public utility. For the sake of protecting public interests, it should be restricted by the municipal government through laws and regulations and should not abuse freedom to harm the lives of the public. As for the statement that the owner has already accepted the contract (the original letter did not specify which contract), and that there is no responsibility for the payment of fees, it is not worth considering. It must be understood that private contracts that violate laws and regulations and harm public interests are invalid. Your company is one of the large companies exclusively engaged in public utilities, and how could you not know this principle and deliberately make excuses? The tenants believe that the Water Company's cutting off the water supply to Peide Lane is a small matter, but undermining the exclusive contract is a big matter. Undermining the exclusive contract means that the company loses its basis for existence. The tenants also firmly believe that the Water Company has an absolute and strict obligation to abide by the exclusive contract, and that supplying water to tenants and collecting water charges from landlords is legally sound. However, reading the last paragraph of your company's reply, stating that it is difficult to collect water charges from the owner or tenants if the water supply is continued, suggests that your company has difficulties in collecting fees from the owners. The tenants may, in fact, be willing to pay on their behalf and are willing to provide a cash guarantee, so there is no reason for the company to cut off the water supply again. As the water supply has been cut off for ten days, there is no time to wait. We hereby request that the company restore the water supply within 24 hours of receiving this letter, and ensure that such inhuman behavior does not occur again in the future. If the company remains stubborn, stubbornly refuses to supply water, and unreasonably oppresses us, it will inevitably put more than 3,000 tenants to death, which is tantamount to re-enacting the May 30th tragedy today. Therefore, in order to safeguard the exclusive contract, save our own lives, and protect the interests of all residents in the concession, the tenants, in addition to publicizing the facts to the world, will have no choice but to take necessary measures to deal with everything in response to the emergency and danger. Your company shall be responsible for the unfortunate consequences arising therefrom. We respectfully request you to forward this letter and hope that you will give it serious consideration. This letter is addressed to the British Shanghai Water Company.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Rent Reduction Association Assists in Rent Increase Dispute, Sends Separate Letters to the First Special District Court and Other Authorities to Uphold Justice <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Rent Reduction Branch of Sandu Lane on Dajilu Road and Zhangjiazhai in this city, due to the landlords' pressure to increase rents, has led to litigation, and has sent letters to the Rent Reduction Committee for assistance. The City Rent Reduction Association yesterday sent separate letters to the First Special District Court and the District Court, requesting them to consider the difficulties of merchants and uphold justice. The two letters are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Letter to the Special District Court <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We have received a letter from the Zhangjiazhai Rent Reduction Branch stating that member Zhu Chaoji requested the landlord to reduce the rent and deposited the rent in the bank, but was unexpectedly ordered by the court to pay. The landlord, seeing an opportunity, has filed lawsuits against members Zhang Miqing and Lu Keming separately, requesting your association's assistance. We also received a letter from the Shuncheng Lane Branch on Yangshupu Road stating that the branch is temporarily located at No. 222 in the lane, which was borrowed from Zhang Yongmin, the second landlord of the house. He owes rent, and the landlord, Huada Company, sued him in court, actually attaching all of his means of livelihood. At the same time, Zhang Shounian at No. 150 and Shi Wenbiao at No. 172 were also sealed up, requesting that justice be upheld to ensure the residents' living. We also received a letter from the Songmao Lane Branch on Songpan Road stating that members Xu Hongru at No. 47, Sun Yongshan at No. 7, Zhang Yueqiu at No. 8, etc., were oppressed and prosecuted by the landlord, hoping for assistance to help the people's livelihood. The Kunming Road Branch also sent a letter stating that Xiang Derong at No. 605 Shunzhi Lane was sealed by the court. According to the information received, reducing rent is to save the people's livelihood in the face of the declining business. However, the price of goods can be reduced, but the price of housing has not been reduced. The price of rice can be restricted and leveled, but rent is one of the necessities of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. How can the people bear the high cost? In order to adjust finances and liberate life, we have no choice but to truthfully request your court to grant relief to ensure the residents' living. It is for the public good. If the owners are allowed to seal up property everywhere at their request, the city's situation will become a desolate world, which will have a great impact on the recovery and prosperity. We hope that your court will consider the people's difficulties and use human persuasion.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Letter to the District Court <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We have received a letter from the Rent Reduction Branch of Sandu Lane on Dajilu Road stating that all members of the association recently received a letter from lawyer Xi Yuchang, representing Liyi Real Estate Company, urging them to pay the rent, and the wording is serious, indicating that they intend to initiate litigation. The members of the association are determined to do their best to deal with it and request that the court be informed to uphold justice and maintain the difficulties of merchants. We also received a letter from the Xicheng Branch of the Tongrenfang stating that the landlord Gu Tingzhang used the pretext of demolition and construction last October to illegally increase the rent by 50% from the original 20 yuan, requiring 30 yuan per month, which is unbearable. They requested the association to forward a letter to the Gu family requesting a rent reduction. Unexpectedly, the Gu family not only did not accept it but intensified their efforts and filed a lawsuit in court. Two families have already been judged by the court to pay the full amount, and the remaining fifteen families are said to be facing continued lawsuits. It is difficult to tolerate such oppression from the landlord. We hereby report to your association and request assistance to avoid being destroyed. We are deeply grateful. According to the information received, reducing rent is to save the people's livelihood and should also be protected by law, but only in a fair manner, to maintain social stability. We hope that the court will uphold justice and consider the difficulties of merchants, which we deeply hope for.</p>
<p>Shishan Lane, Hongkou</p>
<h3 id="e180">Resolution of Water Dispute <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The tenants of Shishan Lane on Dongxi Huade Road in Hongkou were repeatedly notified by the Water Company to sign contracts with the company and pay a deposit, otherwise the water would be cut off, causing panic among all the tenants. At that time, representatives were sent to negotiate with Chen Qiliang, the manager of Xiangmao Company, the owner. Although the owner Chen Qiliang met with them and agreed to subsidize the water bill, according to 8% of the original rent, the tenants of the lane were dissatisfied, resulting in a long period of turmoil that has not been resolved. Recently, the tenants of the lane learned that the water bill subsidy for Xiangshan Lane, which belongs to the same landlord, is 10%, which is unequal treatment. The tenants of the lane were indignant and convened a meeting of all tenants the day before yesterday. After deliberation, it was decided to propose five conditions and send representatives Shi Zhigang, Hong Shiliang, Yang Jingcai, Cai Heqing, and Huang Ruicheng to the Xiangmao Foreign Company yesterday. It was fortunate that Mr. Zhu, an employee of the company, promised to reply within three days. It is recently heard that the owner has agreed to the request. Now, all the tenants in the lane plan to directly pay the deposit to the Water Company before the end of this month and install water meters separately.</p>

<p>Xinxin News Agency reports: "Returning Guests Invited to the East." Mr. Wang Yitang, a member of the North China Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, set sail from Tanggu on the Osaka Merchant Ship Nagasaki Maru on April 18. The ship was named that day, and the inscription commemorating the naming was written by Wang himself seven years ago and is still hanging in the main lounge of the ship. Wang happened to be on this ship, and everyone from the captain of the ship down gave him special treatment to show their welcome. He arrived in Kobe on the 22nd, and the director of the Kobe Maritime Police, Quan Xuexiang, the director of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Hyogo Prefecture Office, and many of Wang's old friends, as well as reporters from the Osaka Mainichi, the Tokyo Asahi, and various Kobe newspapers, and representatives from various esoteric Buddhist groups, a total of one hundred and several tens of people, came to the shore to greet him. Earlier, Wang received many telegrams of welcome from various places while on the ship. At this time, the representative of the Tokyo Welcome Reception, Oi Hoko, and the masters Yoshii Iishi from the Koya Mountain Shizuoka Kyoto Welcome Delegation also rushed to the scene. Wang met with the welcoming party and took photos. Then, under the guidance of Quan, he took a large car specially sent by the Hyogo Prefectural Office from the crowd, along with Nozaki Seikin, and drove straight to Koshien outside Osaka. Most of the welcoming party still rushed to the garden to meet and talk. For a time, the guest room was full, and it was not until 2 p.m. that they gradually dispersed to allow Wang to rest. In the afternoon, at the invitation of Hori Keijiro, the president of Osaka Merchant Shipping and a member of the House of Peers, and his son, Hori Akira, he visited his Mino Villa and had a banquet that evening, returning to Koshien for the night. On the 23rd, he went to Koya Mountain for a short stay, on the 25th to Mount Yoshino, and on the 26th back to Osaka. On the 27th, he attended the Shizuoka Welcome Reception, took an early train to Tokyo, attended the Tokyo Electric Club Welcome Reception on the 28th, stayed for a few days, lingered with Ambassador Jiang and old friends from all walks of life, and plans to attend the Kyoto Toji and Ordinary Temple Welcome Receptions before touring briefly along the way and then returning home.</p>

<p>Modern Chinese architecture is tending towards Westernization, losing its inherent artistic characteristics of the East. Moreover, due to the need for imported building materials, the annual outflow of money is countless. The Shanghai Architectural Association, in view of this, is sparing no effort in studying Eastern architectural art. Recently, Du Yigeng, Liu Jiasheng, Peng Bogang, and others were appointed to the architecture, art, construction, and materials groups, respectively, to travel to Beiping to visit the Forbidden City, collect materials, and study them. The magnificent palace-style architecture is combined with economical and practical Western methods to create modern, economical, and useful architectural forms for the architectural community to choose from, in order to preserve China's inherent artistic characteristics and recover the huge financial losses. It is reported that the representatives have scheduled to depart for the north on the 10th of this month and will publish their findings in the Architectural Monthly published by the association.</p>

<p>Japanese Sugar Intensifies Production</p>
<h3 id="e190">Preparing for Large-Scale Exports to China for Dumping, Domestic Sugar Sales Showing Signs of Improvement, But the Overall Future of the Sugar Market Remains Pessimistic <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>China's sugar market has long been occupied by Japanese merchants. In recent years, due to the bankruptcy of domestic rural areas and the weak purchasing power of the people, sales have become increasingly narrow, and the future of the sugar industry is quite pessimistic. However, Japanese sugar companies still plan to export large quantities to China for dumping. The reporter of the Dagong Daily investigated the recent situation from all parties yesterday and will record it separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Japanese Sugar Efforts Increase Exports to China <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>It is learned that Japan's sugar</p>
<p>manufacturing industry, due to</p>
<p>the poor export of sugar to</p>
<p>China in recent years, is</p>
<p>actively taking measures to</p>
<p>reduce production and limit</p>
<p>the supply in the country,</p>
<p>storing as much excess sugar</p>
<p>as possible to maintain the</p>
<p>equilibrium of supply and demand. However, recently, the Governor-General of Taiwan suddenly encouraged production in order to restore the exports to China in recent years. This year, it is preparing to increase production by 5.2 million dan, planning to transport half of it to China for dumping in order to occupy the East Asian sugar market.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Sluggish Sales Lead to Import Reduction <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the sales volume of sugar in this city has sharply decreased due to increased import tariffs, financial difficulties, and weak purchasing power. In previous years, the total monthly imports often exceeded 300,000 dan. However, recently, it has been only around 30,000 dan, less than one-tenth of the previous amount. The stock in warehouses, at its peak, once exceeded one million dan. However, the total sugar stock in March of this year has been reduced again, to just over 180,000 dan. Judging by its origin, it includes 85,000 dan of Java sugar, 65,000 dan of Cuban sugar, 12,000 dan of Hong Kong sugar, and 10,000 dan each of Shantou and Japanese sugar.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Domestic Refined Sugar Gradually Shows Improvement <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>According to sources in the sugar industry, the quantity of domestic sugar produced in Guangdong's Chaozhou and other places and shipped to Shanghai has been increasing daily. Each sailing vessel imports around 500 to 600 dan of domestic sugar, with a total monthly import of about 10,000 dan. The market price is only 12 to 16 yuan per dan. Although its quality is equivalent to brown sugar or raw sugar, its sales are quite strong due to its low market price. The sales of general foreign sugar have been greatly affected as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Sugar Prices Plunge, Future Pessimistic <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>According to an investigation by a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao, there are currently more than sixty sugar merchants (wholesale outlets) in Shanghai. Last year, due to exchange rate fluctuations, the market price of sugar plummeted, causing significant losses to various businesses. Among them, three or four companies declared bankruptcy due to excessive losses. The remaining businesses have also suffered considerable blows. According to some estimates, even more sugar businesses may close down during the May settlement period this year. The future of the sugar trade remains extremely pessimistic.</p>

<p>Three Germans in a Small Boat</p>
<h3 id="e196">Travel Across the Ocean to Shanghai, One Gave Up Mid-Journey Due to Weakness, Two Arrived Safely in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, Germans Knecht and Teus, both under the age of thirty, along with another person, left Germany in an unsinkable boat three years ago. They sailed along the Mediterranean Sea for six months, then headed east, passed through the Suez Canal, and reached India. Continuing to Calcutta, they sold the boat and bought a larger wooden lifeboat. The new boat was 27 feet long and 27 feet wide. They crossed the Bay of Bengal and reached Yangon. Because the boat was small, they could not sleep comfortably and often stayed on the waterfront at night. The other person gave up mid-journey due to weakness. Upon reaching Burma, the two changed to a more comfortable steamboat, stopping in many places along the way. They arrived in Shanghai last night (the 2nd). The two now intend to find a steamboat capable of crossing the Pacific Ocean and plan to cross the ocean this summer, pass through the Panama Canal, and return home. However, the two are unable to afford to purchase one, so they plan to seek assistance from people in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Spring Fish Arrived in Song Yesterday, The Leading Ship is Named Er He Sheng, Loaded with Five Holds of Yellow Croaker <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The first ship of the annual Northern Yellow Croaker fishing season from Wusong arrived yesterday afternoon. The ship is named Er He Sheng, from Sannan, Shandong. It caught five holds of fish, which were sold through the Bing Feng Fish Company. The holds were opened and sold immediately, and were quickly sold out. According to the fishermen, the fishing season started very early this year. Fish were found as early as the 16th and 17th days of the third month of the lunar calendar, and the fishing season is quite prosperous. Many fishing boats have caught fish, and a large number of fishing boats are expected to arrive in the coming days.</p>
<p>Japanese Yen Soars</p>
<h3 id="e198">Chinese Merchants Continue to Go Bankrupt <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, due to the recent fall in silver prices and the rise in the Japanese yen, Japanese residents are experiencing mixed fortunes due to exchange rate fluctuations. However, speculative Chinese merchants, during this period, have seen both fortunes made and bankruptcies suffered. In the past few days, the rise and fall of the Japanese yen has been erratic (last month, 100 Chinese silver dollars could be exchanged for 116 Japanese yen, but the previous day it suddenly fell to 101 yen). It is reported that the losses of Chinese speculators have reached 30 million yuan, with Cantonese exchange shops suffering the most. The most serious case is Su Heting of Yih Heng Silver Shop on Tianjin Road, who is from Tianjin. He was engaged in this business and suffered losses of 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. He suddenly became disgusted with the world and attempted suicide by taking opium at the Astor House Hotel. Fortunately, he was discovered early, and his life is not in danger. There are countless others who have failed in speculation.</p>
<p>Explosion of a Bomb in Lan Ni Du</p>
<h3 id="e199">Bean Curd Shop Employee Dies Tragically, Source of Bomb Unknown, Employee's Death Gruesome <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>A bomb suddenly exploded in the bean curd shop opened by Sha Sanyuan, a local, at No. 133 Huayuan Stone Bridge Street in Lan Ni Du, Pudong, at 1:00 AM yesterday morning. The loud bang shook the surrounding area, and nearby residents were awakened from their dreams and rushed out to investigate. They saw smoke billowing from the entrance of the shop, with a strong smell of sulfur. Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, rushed to the scene to investigate after being notified by the police. He saw Chen Shiying, an employee of the shop, lying on the ground, his head wounded by the explosion, his face covered in blood, and his right eyeball protruding, groaning in agony. He immediately ordered him to be taken to the Pudong Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was transferred to the Shanghai Medical College Hospital that night for treatment. Chen's brain was severely concussed, and he bled from all seven orifices. He died of his injuries at 7:00 AM in the morning. The hospital notified the court to conduct an autopsy by telephone. In order to understand the origin of the bomb, District Chief Zhang sent household registration inspector Cao Hongci to investigate in detail yesterday morning. According to the shop owner Sha Sanyuan, he has been running the bean curd shop at that location for seven or eight years and has no enemies. Chen Shiying, the shop employee, was 27 years old and from Gujia Roadkou in Pudong. He had been an apprentice in the shop since he was a child and was quite diligent and thrifty. He got up at midnight every night to work. He was raking out the ashes from the stove and pouring them beside the water tank at 1:00 AM that night (i.e., early on the 3rd) when a bomb suddenly exploded in the corner of the wall, killing him. He did not know where it came from. Inspector Cao recovered several pieces of the shattered bomb casing at the scene, each about two-tenths of an inch thick, and took them back to the bureau for examination. Chen Shiying, the shop employee who was tragically killed, was the only son, 27 years old this year, and had just married last year. His father died early, and he only had a mother at home.</p>
<p>Robbers Disguised as Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<h3 id="e200">Detectives Intercept and Arrest on the Way, One Pulling a Rickshaw, One Riding a Bicycle, One Walking, Two Handguns and Many Bullets Found in the Vehicles - Previously Committed Major Robbery and Murder Case - <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Jin Jiulin, the inspector general of the special agency of the French Concession police, received a secret report on the afternoon of the day before yesterday that robbers disguised as rickshaw pullers and bicycle riders were going to rob on Haig Road and would pass through the intersection of Ba Xian Qiao, Route Ma Gao Bao Lu, and Route Wagner. Inspector General Jin then led detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin, deputy detective Zhou Bingcheng, and detectives Liu Dianlong, Cai Jinzhang, and Ma Yizhi to the above-mentioned location, where they lay in ambush. At 4:30 PM, they saw three people, one riding a bicycle, one pulling a rickshaw, and one walking alongside, coming from east to west. Their appearance was suspicious. The detectives rushed forward, surrounded the three, and inspected the bicycle, which was numbered 19869, and the rickshaw license, which was numbered 1712. They found two Browning handguns, numbered 554 and 26580, and thirteen bullets in the gun case under the rickshaw seat, with two clips loaded with bullets. They immediately took them to the police station for questioning. The bicycle rider gave his name as Zhou Xuan, 27 years old, from Funing. The rickshaw puller gave his name as Hua Si, also known as Yi Ming, 49 years old, from Jiangbei. The pedestrian gave his name as Chen Chunfang, also known as A San, 32 years old, from Jiangbei. The detectives then discovered that the robbery of Xu Zhishan, a Yangzhou resident who ran an old stamp business at No. 31 Jin Yu Li, Route de Pesson, at 7:00 PM on March 26 of this year, and the shooting of Detective Li Qiliang of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, who was with his partner Li Liangfu, by robbers who opened fire on pedestrians being inspected on Jiaotong Road, resulting in the death of both men, were committed by the same robbers. When questioned, the three robbers confessed without hesitation. They also confessed to committing many robberies in the French Concession. The detectives reported the information to the Western Police Chief, who ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday at noon, they were escorted to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Li Changnian sat in the first criminal court to hear the case. Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendants had committed many robberies and murder cases and that the police had not yet begun investigating due to time constraints. He requested a postponement of two weeks to detain the defendants while the details of the case were investigated and prosecuted. He also presented the handguns and bullets to the court. The court verified the report, briefly questioned the three defendants, and then approved the postponement for further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Guangzhao Shelf Trade</p>
<h3 id="e201">Rende Hall Lawsuit, Li Jiafu Sues Lu Bingjie First, Lu Sues Li for Financial Review - Court Orders Postponement for Ten Days - <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously received reports accusing the directors of the Rende Hall of the Shanghai Guangzhao Shelf Trade of illegally selling the hall's public property, engaging in fraudulent accounting, and controlling the hall's affairs. Therefore, it ordered the hall to be reorganized and instructed Lu Bingjie, a member of the trade association, to take over all affairs before the reorganization. Subsequently, Lu complied with the order and convened a reorganization meeting on March 19, electing members to the reorganization committee and resolving to dismiss the old directors, including Li Jiafu. At the same time, he requested the First Special District Court to return the hall's deposits at the Commercial Bank that had been submitted to the court. However, Li Jiafu and others believed that the accusations against them were mostly fabricated. In addition to complying with the order to submit the hall's accounts and books to the Bureau of Social Affairs for investigation and making a defense, they specifically hired lawyer Chen Huanyin to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Lu Bingjie, requesting that the resolutions of March 9 be declared invalid. The court had already summoned them once, which was reported in the newspapers. It is now known that Lu Bingjie's side, in response to the lawsuit filed by Li Jiafu, Chen En, and others, has also filed a lawsuit against Li and Chen for financial review through their representative lawyer, in addition to legally defending themselves. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan held a hearing. According to Chen Zhongyin, the lawyer representing Li and others, the hearing was originally for the preservation of evidence requested by the plaintiffs Li Jiafu and others. However, since the case was filed, it had been mediated by the Guangdong fellow villagers, and Li Dachao, the section chief of the Municipal Government, had reached a settlement with both parties. On April 26, Mr. Li sent the draft settlement agreement to both parties, and a formal contract would be signed on April 30. Before the formal contract was signed, he requested that the case be temporarily suspended. He also submitted a copy of the draft agreement to the court. However, Lu's representative lawyer expressed disagreement with the so-called settlement, stating that he had never entrusted Mr. Li to mediate and that Lu Bingjie was now representing 192 members of the trade association in suing Li Jiafu, Chen Enbao, and others, requesting that they hand over all accounts for review. This case was completely different from the lawsuit filed by Li and others and should be investigated. Judge Qiao then ordered the lawyer to state the reasons for the lawsuit. He then stated that the Rende Hall was similar in nature to a trade union and that the hall's property was donated by all members of the trade association and should be owned by all members, not just a few individuals. According to the hall's regulations, all accounts should be publicly reported every month and published in a credit record, and an annual final account should be prepared at the end of the year. However, since June of last year, the accounts had never been published, and no credit record had been issued. The defendants all had duties and should be held responsible. Therefore, he requested that they be ordered to hand over the accounts for review. Lawyer Chen stated that the hall's accounts had already been submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs and that all members of the hall had the right to review the accounts and could request the Bureau of Social Affairs to review them. However, those who were not members could not request to review the accounts. However, he had only recently learned of Lu Bingjie's lawsuit against Li and others and had not had time to prepare the defense procedures or submit the power of attorney. The court then ordered a postponement until the afternoon of May 10 for further hearing.</p>
<p>Impersonating French Consul to Defraud</p>
<h3 id="e202">Three Russians Convicted <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Russians Lai Weiqi Ji, Lao Maimo Nuofu, and Bao Baofu were previously arrested for falsely impersonating the French vice consul, French chief patrol, and detective chief to defraud Xu Haidu, a Chinese national, by claiming to be able to issue gambling licenses and requesting 30,000 yuan in expenses. The French Concession Police Western Detective Fan Langdeng discovered this and arrested Lai and the other two, along with persons involved, Si Duinao Fa and La Guliya Fa Ladimier. They collected various evidence and sent them to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution, announcing the end of the trial and awaiting a scheduled sentencing. This was previously reported in the newspaper. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. At 10:00 AM, the police escorted the defendants to the court, where Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the third criminal court, ordering the defendants to be brought to the court. Lai Weiqi Ji and Lao Maimo Nuofu were sentenced to one year of imprisonment each for jointly committing attempted fraud as recidivists. Bao Baofu was sentenced to one month of imprisonment for assisting in attempted fraud. The judgment was final.</p>
<p>The number of days previously detained will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Si Duinao Fa and La Guliya Fa Ladimier were found not guilty. The attached civil suit will be transferred to the civil court for trial.</p>
<p>First Attempted Suicide Saved</p>
<h3 id="e203">Second Hanging Fatal, Cheng Yongnong's Fate Due to Gambling, Last Testament Strongly Condemns the Harms of Gambling <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Yongnong, from Anhui, 24 years old, was previously a weaver at the Xie Sheng Electrical Silk Weaving Factory at No. 81 Huade Road. He was addicted to gambling and, recently, was unable to repay his gambling debts. Therefore, not long ago, he became distraught and conceived the idea of ending his life. He rented a room at the Yangzi Hotel and attempted suicide by smoking opium. He was discovered and the Lao Zha Police Station was notified, which ordered detectives to take him to the hospital, where he was saved. However, Cheng's determination to die was unwavering. The day before yesterday, he went to Room 7 of the Dalu Hotel at No. 640 Lane 6, Huade Road, alone and hanged himself. When the tea boy Zhao Huatang discovered him, he immediately tried to untie him, but he was already in critical condition. He immediately reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. They then took him to St. Luke's Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died. A suicide note was found next to him, in which he described the harms of gambling and his inability to survive, which led him to have suicidal thoughts. The detectives then took his body to the Fielun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, accompanied by forensic clerk Wang Zuyi, to the morgue to examine the body. According to Cheng Songyi, 29 years old, the deceased was his nephew, and his father was currently in their hometown. He was not aware of his actions until someone told him. He was now taking the body on behalf of his family. According to Zhao Huatang's statement, Mr. Diao issued a verdict that the deceased, Cheng Yongnong, had indeed died by hanging himself and ordered that the body be handed over to Cheng Songyi to be taken back for burial after he signed a guarantee.</p>

<p>There are many stalls at the Jing'an Temple Bathing Buddha Festival every year. This year, the shops in the area near the temple sent a letter to the Public Works Department with their concerns. Yesterday, the Director-General of the Public Works Department replied, saying that they would try to reduce the impact of the temple fair on shop traffic. The number of stalls will be less than in previous years, and there will be space behind the stalls and in front of the shops to allow convenient access for all shops. The Public Works Department has also announced that, for this year's and future temple fairs, stallholders are only allowed to sell Chinese handicrafts.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department of the International Settlement, following a proposal by the French Concession, decided to increase the annual bicycle tax from three yuan to four yuan, effective January 1 of next year, and to collect a magnetic license fee of approximately two jiao from April 1 of this year. The Bicycle Manufacturers Association raised objections to this matter, and the Public Works Department reconsidered. After carefully considering the points raised by the association, such as the economic situation of bicycle riders, a comparison of the tax rates in other countries, and the impact on the industry, they concluded that the request could not be approved. The Public Works Department has already replied to the Chinese Ratepayers Association on this matter.</p>

<p>The China Relief Society previously co-sponsored winter relief grain distribution with the Chang'an Branch of Shaanxi, as previously reported. The Society has now sent a letter to the Branch, reporting on the conclusion of the winter relief effort. According to the Branch, the disaster in Shaanxi Province has already reached an unmanageable stage. Now, during the time when there is no new harvest and the old harvest has been depleted, countless people are selling their wives and children, and entire families are dying of starvation or committing suicide. The Branch is heartbroken by this tragic situation and is making efforts to save money and reduce expenses, and is also appealing for donations, while in the process of handling spring relief grain distribution. However, Shaanxi has suffered from years of disasters, it is an extremely poor place, and is unable to assist. The amount of donations collected is very small. It is hoped that charities at home and abroad, when those in distress are awaiting rescue and life is hanging by a thread, can give a donation of one yuan, which can save the life of one more person. The millions of disaster victims are eagerly awaiting assistance. Sichuan Shops</p>

<p>Szechuan Store at the Ball Game Field in this city, specializing in selling genuine Szechuan silver ear fungus, all Szechuan native products, and ginseng, deer antler, and other precious tonics, has a history of many years. The goods are authentic, and the prices are fair, enjoying a reputation at home and abroad. Even though the market is sluggish, the store's business has been steadily progressing. Recently, it has opened a new main store on the most prosperous Nanjing Road (at the entrance of Pintang Lane) in this city. Due to its long-standing reputation, business is also extremely prosperous. The owner of the store originally owned many silver ear fungus farms in his native Szechuan. The silver ear fungus sold is harvested from his own farms. However, in early last year, after the personnel stationed in the mountains packed and shipped all the silver ear fungus harvested in the summer and autumn seasons, the red bandits occupied areas such as Suiwan, where the silver ear fungus was produced, and were in the hands of the bandits for several months. Now that these places have been recovered by our army, the Szechuan Store specially dispatched personnel who were originally stationed in the mountains a month ago, and hired many skilled personnel familiar with the quality of silver ear fungus producing areas and proficient in baking techniques, to rush to the silver ear fungus farms to actively organize and add huge tree branches for growing ear fungus. The store also, based on the standard of previous scientific testing of the best ear fungus produced in a certain place, re-expanded dozens of silver ear fungus farms to further increase the production of silver ear fungus. The tonic quality of silver ear fungus, and the special effects of treating diseases, are even more abundant. The price paid by people from all walks of life who regularly consume the store's silver ear fungus can also be gradually reduced, and they can also eat better silver ear fungus. It is truly rare to find a business operator in recent times who is as considerate of the interests of customers as the Szechuan Store.</p>

<p>The case of Lu Shuying suing Huang Guanquan for abandonment was heard by Judge Xiong Yi of the Second Special District Court. The details of the hearing were reported in this newspaper on the 29th of last month. According to another source, Huang Guanquan, originally from Gaoqiao, is currently 42 years old. In August of the 19th year of the Republic of China, he went to Hangzhou to supervise construction and lived in Hangzhou for two years. After the project was completed and he returned, he was re-hired as a member of the Huangqiao Guandi Temple Construction Supervision Committee. It is said that Lu Shuying had previously filed a complaint with the First Special District Court and the Second Special District Court, accusing him of abandonment, but both were rejected. Lu then filed a complaint with the Second Special Local Court. It is said that when Huang was supervising construction in Hangzhou, the house where Lu and her four children lived had to be demolished. At that time, Lu's husband, Hong Xianghou, was traveling in Ningbo, and the women were unable to move for a while. Lu begged Wang Xiangfa, a neighbor, to ask Huang to request the landlord to postpone the demolition. The landlord, feeling sorry for their poverty, allowed the request to avoid homelessness. Later, Hong Xianghou returned to Hangzhou after being unemployed and learned about the situation. He was deeply grateful for the efforts of Wang and Huang and held a banquet to thank them. Hong Xianghou expressed his willingness to form a marital alliance with Huang and asked Wang to act as matchmaker on the spot, betrothing his eldest daughter, Ailian, to Huang's second son, Xuetao. The marriage certificate procedures were completed, and a betrothal gift of 110 silver dollars was given. Unexpectedly, the girl's family listened to slander and attempted to fabricate accusations in order to achieve their purpose. It is faintly heard that Huang will file a counterclaim, accusing Lu of false accusation.</p>

This is a common occurrence on this tram. However, the ticket seller loudly insulted them, saying that the people who ride the tram are all "low-class people" and "cheapskates." As a result, the passengers in the carriage were in an uproar. Passengers who did not consider themselves "low-class people" or "cheapskates" questioned him, thinking that the passengers are the source of income for ticket sellers, so why should they be regarded as "low-class people" and "cheapskates"? But this ticket seller No. 210 was unreasonable and did not admit his mistake, so he became the target of public criticism. The passengers quarreled and almost came to blows. Seeing that he had angered the public and the situation was unfavorable, the ticket seller quickly ordered the tram to stop and reported to the police.

This time, he is back in the saddle, and the performance is even more exciting.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Reading Questions and Answers <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>"A History of the New Chinese Literature Movement"</p>
<p>Questions After Reading Material One</p>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>After reading "Historical Materials on the New Chinese Literature Movement" compiled by Huang Ruoying and published by Guangming Bookstore, I cannot help but have the following questions. I am now raising them specifically, and I urge the gentlemen to provide me with a detailed and public answer.</p>
<p>First, what exactly did the "May Fourth Movement" achieve in literature? In this book, from the first to the sixth compilation, almost all are historical materials about the debate between new and old literature before and after the "May Fourth Movement." In these historical materials, we see that the so-called new literature movement at that time was actually a vernacular movement, and all debates started from the point of view of the use of writing. Whether there are defects in this movement itself cannot but make people doubt (because in my opinion, the difference between new and old literature should not only lie in writing), and in its achievements, although Mr. Hu Shi pointed out several key points in the article "Literary Revolution Movement": "First, vernacular poetry can be considered to be on the road to success,... Second, short stories have gradually been established." But I still dare not deeply believe it. If Mr. Hu's so-called "success" refers to changing "zhī hū zhě yě" (classical Chinese particles) to "de me ne ma" (modern Chinese particles), then that's fine, but if not, the success of literary works should also depend on their content, and should also depend on their receptivity to readers. Then I can say that the works created in the May Fourth era that can be given to us to read are really few and far between, except for "Nahan" (Call to Arms) and "Panghuang" (Wandering). For example, Xu Zhimo's poems, no matter how the literary world calls him a "poetry sage", have nothing to do with us. Even if we take a step back and only talk about vernacular Chinese, what they left behind are still some incomprehensible, completely Europeanized sentences, or newly styled classical Chinese that are like restructured bound feet. May I ask, is speech consistent with writing now? Are there many literary publications that the public can understand now?</p>
<p>Second, the fifth compilation of this book is historical material about the issue of sorting out the national heritage. Of course, sorting out the national heritage is not absolutely impossible, because the development of literature is the same as the development of society, and it has its inevitable historical development process. For example, the current Soviet literary world has raised the issue of accepting literary heritage. But I believe that this issue should only be raised when the new literature has already laid its strong foundation. In our country, not long after the May Fourth Movement, the new literature movement cannot be said to have unfolded much. As mentioned above, even the vernacular movement has not completed its initial task. If we turn our heads at this time and delve into a dead end, specializing in what "Dream of the Red Chamber textual research," isn't this obviously picking up the light and neglecting the important, obviously abandoning their current main mission, and obviously rebelling against themselves? Not long ago, someone raised the issue of accepting heritage in a certain issue of literature. May I ask, where is our literary heritage?</p>
<p>Third, there is no doubt that China's new literature movement is still progressing. But what I want to ask is, is the slogan of "restoring the spirit of the May Fourth Movement" correct? What are the similarities between the current literary movement and the May Fourth era? Song Yang's article "The Question of Mass Literature and Art" was published in the previous Literary Monthly, which raised the topic of "what language to write in." He advocated creating a new vernacular Chinese for the masses themselves (not the May Fourth-style vernacular Chinese), but how to create it? Is this inheriting the unfinished vernacular movement in literature of the "May Fourth Movement"?</p>
<p>In addition, there are of course many other questions, such as what role did the Literary Research Association and the early Creation Society play at that time? They are both the main forces of the new literature movement, why did they become opposed to each other? Why did two different literary and artistic trends emerge in the same period—because it is said that the Literary Research Association represented naturalism, while the Creation Society represented romanticism? These are all what we urgently want to know, but if the length is limited, then please answer the three points specifically raised above first.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Amidst Firecrackers, Our National Delegation Departs for the Philippines. Departing at 3:30 PM Yesterday on the McKinley. Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, and Others All Went to the Wharf to See Them Off. <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese delegation attending the 10th Far Eastern Games, consisting of over a hundred athletes and staff selected from Shanghai, led by Wang Zhengting, gathered at the new customs wharf yesterday at 2 PM and set off for the Philippines aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President McKinley. The athletes and staff boarded the ferry in drizzling rain and departed from the new customs wharf at 2 PM, sailing directly to the McKinley at the Bailianjing wharf in Nanshi. The ship set sail at 3:30 PM, with a large crowd of well-wishers. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e240">A Glimpse of the Wharf <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Around 1 PM, the new customs wharf was already crowded with people, because all sectors of society have endless hope that our athletes will bring glory to the country by attending the Far Eastern Games this time. Afterwards, staff and athletes arrived one after another. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Education Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan, Special Secretary Xiao Tongqian from the Central Propaganda Department, Qian Cangshuo from the Central News Agency, and others all went to the wharf to see them off. The Qin Fen Bookstore also prepared a large flag with the words "Celebrating the Victory of the Chinese Delegation to the Far Eastern Games" and "The Chinese Delegation to the Far Eastern Games Returns Triumphantly with Medals," which had a majestic momentum.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Slowly Leaving the Wharf <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Those seeing them off were elated, and the delegation members were full of energy. Wang Zhengting, Shen Siliang, Zhou Jiaqi, and others entertained everyone. The ferry left the wharf at 2 PM. For a while, hats and handkerchiefs were waved on the shore and on the ship, expressing extreme emotions of parting. Many of the athletes held cameras and took pictures of those seeing them off as a memento. Workers and police officers from the Sports Association, etc., each donated 60 cents to purchase a large batch of firecrackers to set off at the wharf, adding a lot of color. The relatives and families of the staff and athletes followed the ferry all the way to the large ship.</p>
<h3 id="e242">The Dollar Wharf <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Sailing through the wind and waves all the way to Nanshi, there was a lot of laughter on the ship, which was very lively. After about three quarters of an hour, they arrived at the edge of the McKinley at the Dollar Wharf in Bailianjing. At that time, firecrackers were also set off at the wharf to welcome them. The Chinese at the Dollar Wharf also prepared a flag that said, "Celebrating the Departure of the Chinese Athlete Delegation to the Philippines," which showed their enthusiasm. The staff and athletes boarded the McKinley one after another, each looking for their reserved room to settle down. At 3:30 PM, the fire was lit and the ship set sail. Everyone stood on the deck to bid farewell to those seeing them off again. The ferry then sailed back to the customs at 3:45 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Arrival Date in the Philippines <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The funding for this trip to the Philippines is only 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Fundraising has now ended, but those who continue to donate from various places will be remitted to the Philippines by the Association. Ms. Gao Zi, the head coach of the women's team, was unable to go to the Philippines due to business, and Ma Yuehan also serves as her position. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 5th to continue loading athletes from Hong Kong and Guangdong. According to the company, it may be delayed until the 6th before arriving in Hong Kong, and arriving in the Philippines should be on the morning of the 8th. It is said that the delegation will take the President Jackson on the 24th of this month to leave the Philippines and return to China, and arrive in Shanghai around the 28th.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Wang Zhengting Speaks <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Wang Zhengting led the Chinese delegation participating in the Far Eastern Games on the Dollar Steamship Company's McKinley to the Philippines. When Wang boarded the ship at the new customs wharf, he answered reporters' questions and said that rumors that Wang, who also serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, would resign and that he would succeed him as Minister of Foreign Affairs, etc., were not known to him. As for going to Jiangxi and Shanxi to meet Chairman Chiang the other day, it was to discuss the Far Eastern Games. The rumors were not true. As for the participation of the puppet state in the Far Eastern Games, it is absolutely not a problem. Our side still holds its original position to seek implementation. According to head coach Ma Yuehan, although our country's hopes are slim in this conference, we have a considerable degree of certainty in scoring in track and field, and our hopes for ball games are even stronger.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Education Subsidies from the Public Works Department <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>A Slight Change in the Principle Regarding Construction Costs</p>
<p>The Education Committee of the Public Works Department previously decided on a principle regarding subsidies for Hua schools, that is, after that, except for urgent needs for cleaning equipment, all construction costs would not be subsidized. The Subsidy Committee subsequently requested that this principle be slightly changed. The Education Committee reviewed it again. Some committee members believed that the previously determined principle was appropriate. Once construction costs are given, the Public Works Department can no longer intervene in the school, unlike the subsidy for annual fees, which can be suspended if there is any non-compliance. Moreover, it is easier for private individuals to raise construction costs, while it is more difficult to donate recurrent expenses. Furthermore, the total amount of subsidies in the bureau is also limited. If everyone asks for help with construction costs, the subsidy for each school's recurrent expenses will be reduced even further. However, according to the Subsidy Committee's vision, it does not advocate giving large sums for construction subsidies. However, in view of the fact that there are very few houses in the concession suitable for schools to rent, it is deemed appropriate for schools to build their own houses and for the Public Works Department to give special consideration and slightly subsidize them to encourage them. After continuous discussion, the Education Committee decided that the previously determined principle did not need to be changed, but if a school builds its own house and can slightly subsidize it to help it succeed, it should be given special consideration.</p>
<p>The Subsidy Committee proposed to give a total of 15,900 yuan in construction subsidies to five schools in 1934, which was approved. In addition, the construction subsidy of 5,600 yuan previously proposed for three schools should be canceled, and this money should be distributed to twelve schools for normal use. This proposal was also approved. In addition, the Subsidy Committee proposed that the subsidies for a certain eight schools should not be reduced (some of which were designated for construction), which was also approved. The construction costs must be used before the end of 1935, and the schools should be notified of this intention. The above points decided by the Education Committee were submitted to the Board of Directors on May 2 and approved.</p>

<h3 id="e282">The Problem of Knowledge and Action in the New Life Movement <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>— Recorded by Chen Dongbai</p>
<p>Second, the study of knowledge in the New Life Movement. Although the methods of the New Life are to be clean and simple in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the purpose is to achieve righteousness, health, and shame. Therefore, the general public believes that to implement the New Life, one must first know etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Only by knowing etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame can one implement the New Life. This statement is common everywhere. Therefore, after the birth of the New Life Movement, the general public paid special attention to etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. However, I believe that although the New Life aims to achieve etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame cannot be separated from the life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, as long as the life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation is disciplined, etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame can be expressed in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and it is not to do etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame outside of clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame are abstract philosophies. In ancient times, many people were studying them, but opinions were divided and each had its own saying. So far, there is no final conclusion. It can be seen that the principles of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame are not easy to understand. Guanzi said, "Etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of the country. If the four pillars are not strong, the country will decline and perish." Although Guanzi advocated etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame in this way, did he ever understand it himself? The Analects say, "The prince of the state plants a gate to block the door, and Guan also plants a forest to block the door. The prince of the state has a counter-slope for the good of the two princes, and Guan also has a counter-slope. If Guan Zhong knew propriety, he did not know propriety." It can be seen that Guan Zhong did not first understand the word propriety. The Biography of Guan Zhong in the Records of the Historian says that Guan Zhong and Shao Hu both served Gongzi Jiu. When Gongzi Jiu was killed by Duke Huan, Shao Hu died, but Guan Zhong did not die. Not only did he not die, but he also served Duke Huan of Qi. May I ask, did Guan Zhong know righteousness or not? Guan Zhong once partnered with Bao Shu to do business and shared profits, taking more for himself. May I ask, did Guan Zhong keep integrity or not? Guan Zhong once fought three battles and retreated three times without dying. In this way, did Guan Zhong know shame or not? According to the above, even Guan Zhong himself did not understand etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, not to mention other people. Therefore, we do not need to study the principles of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, because knowledge is difficult. Confucius said, "The people can be made to follow it, but not made to know it." He also said, "Those who know it are not as good as those who like it, and those who like it are not as good as those who enjoy it." This means that we do not need to understand it before we do it. Mr. Zhongshan also said, "Knowing is difficult." Seeking knowledge is certainly important, but it is the responsibility of those who are first to know and first to realize. Otherwise, "knowledge" will never be obtained and "action" will never be scheduled. Currently, everything in China wants to "know before acting." Although there is also meaning, it is impossible for everyone to be like this. Therefore, for the New Life, we do not necessarily have to "know before acting," that is, we do not need to study the principles of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, as long as we admit that etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame are good morals and earnestly follow the New Life Covenant.</p>
<p>Third, the study of action in the New Life Movement. The New Life is entirely the way of life of the people of a country. As long as the people of a country have a certain disciplined way of life, this is the purpose of the country. In ancient China, etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame were emphasized, emphasizing action over knowledge. Those in power set an example and showed them the rules. Ordinary communities can all practice it, and society is very orderly. Even today, ordinary ignorant people and rural women still have this kind of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame in their treatment of people. In fact, they have completely become a habit, so it is naturally revealed. In terms of knowledge, they have never understood the principles of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. From this, it can be seen that the New Life Movement is not a question of knowledge at all, but a question of action. Just follow the New Life Covenant and you can express the spirit of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Mr. Zhongshan said, "Not knowing can also act" is to correct the Chinese people's problem of having to know before acting. Therefore, from now on, for the Life Movement, we do not need to seek its profound theory, just do it earnestly.</p>
<p>Fourth, conclusion. According to the above explanation of knowledge and action, summing up, we can get a conclusion that the New Life Movement is a question of action, not a question of knowledge. There is no need to seek its knowledge, but to seek its action. It does not matter whether we know it or not, but whether we act or not. Rather than wanting to know before acting, it is better to gain knowledge through action. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e283">Amidst the Terrifying Tempest of Finance: Gold Price Rises Slightly by Half a Yuan; Speculators Tread on Thin Ice, Foreseeing a New Peak of 1,087 Yuan; Silver Case Revived, Major Players Cut Losses, Then Falls to 1,050 Yuan <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced rapid changes; speculators treaded on thin ice. The upward trend was fierce, with a new high of 1,087 yuan reappearing. Silver telegrams arrived like snowflakes. Bulls seized the opportunity to sell, causing a drop to the 1,050 yuan mark. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market, in both England and America, rebounded in unison. The forward silver price on the metal exchange conversely shrank by half a cent to eight cents. London raw gold rose five pence. Exchange rates lengthened slightly. American cotton rose twenty-six pounds, American wheat shrank twenty-five. Goods and gold industries all complied with the notice not to trade outside the market, and there were no naked shorts. At the opening, prices were chaotic due to different interpretations, initially at sixty yuan, due to a small number of sellers. However, those generally optimistic strenuously bought in, unable to find a match. Therefore, although the opening price was sixty-four yuan, it simultaneously increased to seventy yuan, making it extremely difficult to determine. People were anxious, and the buying frenzy was intense. Despite struggles, the speculators were like walking on thin ice, and the sellers still dared not easily descend. The gold price soared again, with a new peak of eighty-seven yuan reappearing. However, Reuters telegraphed that Senator King claimed a new bill to maintain the silver price could be established in the current Congress, as the president would reconvene the silver faction meeting today or Friday. New proposals containing procedures to purchase large quantities of silver and issue silver certificates were rumored and caused a setback. Later, it was further reported that Senator Thomas' amendment included three provisions: (1) increasing silver reserves to a gold-silver ratio of three to seven; (2) purchasing foreign debt repayment silver coins at prices ten to twenty-five teins higher than the world silver price; (3) issuing silver certificates, etc. Huge bullish forces suddenly emerged, and the market price stepped down. Regardless of the Reuters report that the renewed meeting between the American silver faction and the President could enable subservient silver legislation to pass in the current Congress during Saturday, it further declined. It successively broke through the three major barriers of eighty, seventy, and sixty yuan. In the aftermath, major players continued to cut losses, the domestic market continued to harden, and banks had no appetite for it. Counterparts hedged their positions, once falling to the fifty yuan mark before stabilizing slightly. The unexpected tempest was beyond anticipation. The red gold price was calculated at 1,077 yuan, with a swap of one yuan and two dimes. The market conditions of today will be recorded in one day's time.</p>

<p>Recently, the social situation has been in a significant downturn, and the first to often feel it is the financial industry. Therefore, the phenomenon of decline has increased year after year. At the end of last month, due to the end of the fourth quarter, all matters had to be sorted out, causing the market to be relatively busy. Now that the end of the fourth quarter has passed, the market atmosphere has also declined. In yesterday's market, there was a lack of foreign gang speculation and investment, and settlement was extremely quiet.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a sudden and lingering decline. In terms of the environment, there was no significant change in the situation. However, large players relentlessly sold, with Nos. 5 and 43 selling off, all with physical goods. People were relatively weak-willed, and bulls also exited and swapped, resulting in a trend of exhaustion. The market price was at its peak, and there was no good opportunity in the environment. Rising was difficult and falling was easy. Most people shared this mentality. However, without the strong selling of powerful large players, it would not be easy to fall sharply. If there are no major changes in the future, the market price will generally tend to hover. Although the decline yesterday was not fierce, the trend was uninspired from morning to night. Because Nos. 5 and 1 had been selling for several days, the amount was already large, and it was heard that there were mostly physical goods. In addition, No. 43 joined the selling side and was also quite enthusiastic. As a result, bulls exited and swapped, and the overall situation throughout the day was that the initial drop was large. The short-term was fierce and six and a half dimes small. The number that had risen the previous day was all wiped out in one session and even surpassed. People's morale was exhausted, and it was not easy to struggle for a while. The next session continued to be two or three dimes small, only the opening in the afternoon was somewhat chaotic, but it was still more falling than rising. The closing fell again by two or three dimes small. As a result, the market price fell uniformly by two or three dimes to one yuan, one dime. The total number of transactions was 13,706,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods and 13,705,000 yuan in futures.

<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the upward trend is gradually rising. As foreign cotton rises, and customer sales demand continues unabated, the condition of spot yarn is improving day by day. However, sellers still short sell when prices rise, and the pressure on the yarn market has not diminished. Considering it statistically, inventory has decreased a lot, and the price of Japanese yarn is more expensive than Chinese yarn, so the sales market for Chinese yarn has hope. Japanese yarn prices rose two or three yuan today, and 20-count yarn prices rose one or two yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>Indian cotton, which had been falling for a long time, suddenly rose sharply, and American cotton also tended to rise. The exchange rate shrank sharply, resulting in a large increase in the calculated price. Shorts covered positions, and the market rose sharply. However, a certain short account sold additional positions every day, and the pressure was still heavy. Japanese merchants bought, and spot cotton transactions also developed in the market, making the market very tight.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed an upward trend for all months. Although quotations for foreign wheat remained flat, such as Chicago small fourths around, Canada small fourths one dime and so on. However, the process of flour manufacturers demanding maintenance of flour prices has been partially published in the newspapers. Therefore, people inside and outside the industry are afraid of being suppressed, and people's hearts are quite fearful. As a result, market buying interest is relatively strong, and sellers appear less. Although a certain factory has not coordinated and is still selling off one after another, people's hearts are flourishing, and the situation is ultimately good. Until the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere in various months was still prosperous at first, and each month was better than the near months. However, in later sessions, the current month saw a decline due to long positions returning. Later, as customers slightly entered the market, it rebounded again. Distant months saw long positions in the market raising prices one after another, and people's hearts remained good from beginning to end. According to the current situation, long positions seem to need to borrow the government's strength, and the optimism is only temporary. However, if actual sales are difficult to boost, it is feared that it will still be a false situation. As a result, the current month fell by 2.5 fen, June and July rose by 0.5 fen, August rose by 2.75 fen, September , October rose by 4.25 li, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Wheat Futures Stabilize Due to Rain <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a stable trend for all months. Although foreign wheat quotations remained small at four-eighths of a dime to one dime, the timing was not right, and there was continuous rain, so people's hearts were inevitably stabilized. Therefore, the morning opening showed a stable trend. Until the afternoon quotation, there were other reasons in the market that would change the standard situation a little, so people's hearts were boosted again. As for the current month, there was no interest in buying or selling, and no opening was made. According to the current surge in inventory, even if it opens, it will be less promising. As a result, June was better by 6 fen, July and August were better by 5 fen, and there was no comparison for the rest. Spot wheat did not open again because foreign wheat was pouring in and factories were rejecting it.</p>
<h3 id="e301">River Bottom Rice Price Raised Another 2 Jiao <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>South Yesterday, there were few sources of goods from various gangs, only a dozen or so of late rice,</p>
<p>and six or seven brands of thick japonica (a total of more than 3,000 shi). The market was active, and sellers became more attractive, and the shouts became higher and higher. Both the southern and northern gangs of Yang were afraid of not being able to deliver goods in time. Goods such as Qingjiao, Songsi, and Fengjing were all searched for regardless of quality. The shops and stomachs on this street also followed suit and competed for them, and they were all purchased regardless of thick japonica and colors. As a result, there was no surplus of goods in the market at that time, but at the same time, retail sales were full, and the shape and color were inevitably dull. As a result, the prices of late rice and thick japonica Du Yangjian Bian Wu and other prices all continued to be raised by 2 jiao, and the Yin yuan was still lacking goods and no market.</p>
<p>North Shanghai Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various gangs in the interior was still scarce, only a dozen or so numbers, and more than a hundred boats in the river. The market was selling. It rained in the Heavenly Palace in the morning, and the shops in the city and countryside were deserted. The removal of stomach of various colors was still not relaxed. White japonica Gao Liao continued to rise outside the corner, and the secondary goods were raised by two or three jiao. Yang Jian, Bu Jian, and Ke Jian added to the corner, Bian Yuan added two jiao. Early thin rice was scarce, and the price also rose sharply. Du Jian was also the same. Yin Yuan lacked goods and had no market.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign and local indica market conditions rose together, because it had already reached the end and was clear and light, and the local goods were very popular. The market had been rising step by step due to excessive demand over supply. Yesterday, in addition to Fujian Province continuing to handle smoothly, Quanzhou and Ningbo gangs were also quite active, and even local hoarding households came to the market to compete for handling, and the market suddenly saw a soaring increase. The whole day opened 11,155 bags of various indica, 700 bags of Ji Yuan, and 1,500 bags of Xiaojiao, 1,000 bags of reclaimed Siamese coarse rice. Yuan rice was distributed by the local street and Fujian Province, and most of the machine rice and various indica were also handled by the local street, and the foreign rice was also handled by the local street. Seventy to eighty percent of the local street was taken in by hoarding households. Because of the hoarding households' activities, people's hearts were even more upward. Yesterday, coarse rice and machine rice each rose by more than 1 jiao and 5 fen for Xiaojiao, coarse foreign rice rose by 3 jiao, the amount of foreign Yuan rice in stock was low, and the river bottom train was scarce, which made the competition for this foreign rice even fiercer. Yesterday, it suddenly rose by 3 or 4 jiao, which was more than 1 yuan higher than the middle of last month.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market, with the customs gold rising again and the bid gold continuing to reach a high peak, although sales were not smooth, people's hearts were still firm and rising. The association's price for 24 coarse sand white rose by 2.5 jiao again, to 21.15 yuan, but not much was traded. From the 1st to the 3rd, it rose a total of 8.5 jiao. No. 89 Ho Chi called 16.2 yuan, Taikoo Sugar B called 21.2 yuan, and rose another 2 jiao. The factory's white called prices frequently due to rising raw material prices, and dared not easily sell. Zhenji No. 1 white called 19.6 jiao, and other factories also called 5 jiao, but no transactions were made. The domestic Chaoqing No. 10 goods were all looking up, and they were holding back and not selling. However, the secondary grades of Si Du Qing opened more than 200 bags, and the price was 9.7 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Silk and Tea Cold Weather, Late Silkworm Season <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>The development of spring silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is late. In places like Xiecun and Hushu near "Liangzhu", farmers who plant local varieties this year account for 40 to 50%. However, due to continuous spring rains and low temperatures, early silkworms have been found to have softening and microparticle diseases in the third sleep, resulting in a loss of 60 to 70%. Improved silkworm seeds have strong resistance and are still rarely damaged. They are now just waking up from their third sleep. In areas such as Xucun, Chang'an, and Xuxiang, although foreign silkworm seeds are affected by cold rain, they are still rarely damaged. The early batch has started to leaf out for the third sleep, and the late batch has just completed the second sleep. Local silkworm seeds eat more wet leaves in the third sleep, and the weather is too cold, causing them to spit black, leak yellow, and rot, resulting in 50 to 60% mortality. In "Fuyang", the amount of silkworm eggs raised in various cities and towns has decreased, and there are more farmers raising local varieties. The rural economy is bankrupt, and only families with mulberry trees are trying their best to raise them. However, the weather is not right, and there is more spring cold and rain. The local silkworms that need leaves during sleep all have silkworm diseases and lose a lot of leaves. Improved silkworm seeds develop later, and are currently only completing their second sleep. Farmers in various cities and towns of "Liyang" have little interest in raising silkworms due to losses in previous years. Instructors have gone to various villages to distribute improved seeds and encourage people to raise them. During the incubation period, the weather was cold, and the ants only hatched after 14 or 15 days. They are now only opening leaves for the first sleep. Only 60% of the local silkworm seeds have hatched, and all types of silkworms cannot hatch, it is said.</p>
<p>Double Palace Silk Production Exceeds Demand The demand for Indian double palace silk is still strong, but only Fulun Heng is working among the double palace silk factories in Shanghai. The silk production is limited, and the demand exceeds the supply. Last month, the British ship loaded 28 packages to India.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the production of new Wenzhou red and green tea last week, the output has been quite strong. Each number of intake has more than 200 dan. The selling price of raw tea is 45 yuan, and the cost is slightly higher than the old one. The tea numbers in this area are now rushing to work day and night. According to news from Wenzhou yesterday, more than half of the new tea with the first character has been made, and it should be shipped to Shanghai for sale next week, it is said.</p>

<p>The green tea in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, has always been of excellent quality. The Shui Tu Zhuang gangs have attached great importance to it this year. Recently, the green tea in this area has begun to be picked. Tea merchants on Sian Road are constantly coming and going. According to a telegram received by the Tu Zhuang factory, Huzhou raw tea has opened the scale, with a price of 76 yuan, and the secondary goods are sold for 68 yuan. The market is extremely active, it is said.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Therefore, the position of this director is absolutely unworthy for Meng Fuxiang. He is simply a completely useless puppet. Please pay attention to the following, and you can believe it. Because the Empress Dowager was eager to know some knowledge about trains, she sent someone to summon Meng Fuxiang. When he came, he naturally kowtowed respectfully first. After kowtowing, although he stood up, he did not dare to look up. His eyes were always looking at the floor, waiting for the Empress Dowager to inquire.</p>
<p>"What exactly makes this train move?" The Empress Dowager's first question.</p>
<p>"Replying to the Empress Dowager... Replying to the Old Buddha," Meng Fuxiang had a stutter, so his speech was very slow and disconnected. "It is these workers on the train who drive the train!"</p>
<p>"Is this still afraid that I don't know it! Now, I just ask you, how exactly do they</p>
<p>drive the train?"</p>
<p>"This servant deserves to die! This... this servant doesn't know! This servant doesn't know! This servant dares not... dares not... dare not reply rashly!"</p>
<p>"Remember at the previous station," Although his reply was so disappointing, the Empress Dowager insisted on asking him. "For what reason did our train once retreat to the back? Now tell me, why can these wheels roll forward?"</p>
<p>"This... this... servant kno... kno... knows! Replying to the Empress Dowager! This is done by the driver!"</p>
<p>"Then, how do they stop this train?" "Replying to the Empress Dowager! Six people jump off the train and run to the last car to grab the wheel. As long as they grab it with all their strength, the train will stop!"</p>
<p>This answer may be more accurate than Meng Fuxiang himself thought, because he always thought that the brakemen must have forcibly pulled the train. (25)</p>
<h3 id="e308">Flowers in the Field <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>When you go to the suburbs and look around, between the ridges and fields, there are splendid golden flowers, and they bloom densely, as if drawing squares. If you are flying in an airplane in the sky and look down at the lower world, don't say that the round earth is a turbid and dark Asura field. In reality, it has turned into a golden world, reflecting into its eyes. There are also small flowers like butterflies, fluttering in the spring breeze, as if flying after each other. Especially the color is white with purple, and the purple has very large black spots, so from a distance, it looks like countless butterflies gathered in the lush green grass. These two kinds of flowers are not wild, but agricultural crops in the field.</p>
<p>The first kind: is the flower of rapeseed, which is said to have been obtained from outside the Great Wall. The place of production is called "Yuntai Garrison". Therefore, this kind of flower is also called "Yun Tai Flower". The petals are cruciform, with one pistil and six stamens. At the bottom of the stamens, there is also a green small ball, which scientists call the nectar gland, which constantly secretes sweet juice. Therefore, many bees</p>
<p>constantly shuttle back and forth, and are extremely close to the rapeseed flowers, as if forming an indissoluble bond. Farmers sow this kind of vegetable in winter, and in spring they harvest its stalk, commonly called "vegetable sword", which can also be made into kimchi and stored in jars. Shanghai also calls it "Taiwan Heart Vegetable", which is actually rapeseed. Its seeds can be pressed for oil, an indispensable auxiliary product for making biscuits.</p>
<p>The second kind: is the flower of broad beans, which bloom in August of last year and have to plant seeds. It was not until the sericulture season this year that they bloomed, so the fruits they bear are called "silkworm beans." Its stem is like a ridge, the pod is long and wide, and the bean is flat and large, about half an inch in size. When it is hard and old, the color turns green, and there is a black bay on the head, like an eyebrow, so some people say: the term "silkworm bean" comes from this. This thing can be eaten as a vegetable or made into sauce, and its sales are extremely wide. If the harvest is abundant, farmers compete to call it "small ripe." Yang Wanli, a former Shanghainese poet, said: "Emerald pods are lined with light green beads, sweet fraud cliff is dense and soft fraud su, sand bottles are newly ripe with West Lake water, lacquer pots are shared with dawn dew, taste and cherry plum are three beneficial friends, the name is due to silkworm cocoons and a thread of brilliance, the old farmer's troupe is learning together, and the score is written in the poem as a farming book." This poem is an extremely wonderful work about broad beans.</p>

<p>But he seemed unwilling to move his seat or walk away, considering his past relationship with her. As a result, the anxiety in his heart was all reflected on his face, turning red from his cheeks, straight to the back of his ears. However, Ji Zhi still did not feel it, and kept sniffing towards this side for the source of the fragrance. Finally, he still found the fragrance, which turned out to be from the wool scarf. Because half of the scarf was dragging into his arms, the remaining fat and powder on it were emitting a fragrance upward. He didn't watch the play, and closed his eyes, as if he was an old hand listening to the play, but in fact, he was savoring the taste of the fragrance. People say that soft jade and warm fragrance fill the arms, but this is just a descriptive term. However, in the current situation, it is truly warm fragrance filling the arms. I suppose Zhao Ziqiang, that kind of martial man, how could he understand... "Mr. Gan, what's the matter? Are you entranced by the listening?" Ji Zhi opened his eyes, and Mr. Zhao was looking at him with a smile. Ji Zhi smiled: That's right, I wanted to steal the ornamentation of this erhu, so I closed my eyes so that my ears could use all their strength to ponder it. Mr. Zhao smiled: In that case, Mr. Gan is paying one cent of money to earn two cents of capital back by listening to the play. He meant that Ji Zhi was both listening to the play and stealing the erhu, and had no other intention. Guizhi was feeling uneasy, and when she heard these two sentences from the public, she thought it was secretly teaching Ji Zhi a lesson, and her face became even more feverish, almost to the point of shedding tears. But the more it was like this, the more she dared not walk away, and had to reluctantly look straight ahead, watching the stage. With great difficulty, she finished watching the play and walked out with the people leaving the arena. Now that Guizhi had freedom to watch, she deliberately walked faster, walking in front of her mother. All the way, she kept a long distance from Ji Zhi. Ji Zhi and Mr. Zhao followed far behind, still talking about things. Mr. Zhao still wanted to invite Ji Zhi to his home to talk, but Ji Zhi's heart could not be completely calm, so he left without going. (376)</p>

<p>The brilliant sunshine and hazy scenery have passed the season of yellow plums, and in the silvery sound of rain, it quietly flies away. On the muddy cultivated embankment, there are scattered peach blossoms, and in the gloomy wet sky, there are light catkins.</p>
<p>Above the Luo valley-like flowing waves, drooping with turning green willow silk. Alas! The crisp-boned sunny spring of Jiangnan is far gone.</p>
<p>Sitting in a small study room with shrimp whisker curtains blocking the sun, burning a cigarette, quietly looking at the clear blue sky, a fallen flower skimmed past, being kicked by a swallow: together they fell to the eaves, so I rolled up the curtain, wanting to catch the wandering spring-is it a good phenomenon?</p>
<p>The soul, unexpectedly, had fallen into a backwater under the water pavilion, swallowed into the belly by a swimming fish, regurgitated again, blown into the waves, that spring soul was much thinner!</p>
<p>If in front of you is a clear lake, and outside the lake is a bamboo forest, the drizzle is falling delicately, and the fallen flowers are also falling: following the silk wind to send to the resting window lattice, bringing a little lonely residual fragrance: at the same time, several water birds also fly shoulder to shoulder with the fallen flowers, these shadows are all projected onto the lake surface, that is truly a music without any sound!</p>
<p>If it is a clear night with a new moon, the moon shadow is blown onto the railing by the wind, and the pear flowers in the courtyard are falling dimly, as light as snowflakes, as dense as silver rain; yet there is no hint of sadness.</p>
<p>If you return after fishing a few small fish, driving a short boat, rowing with the oar, and parting the evening mist covering the lake, a fallen flower blows obliquely from the shore, blowing onto my smoke hat. The hat is woven from green bamboo and cannot bear it, so it slips down the vast water mist, like the spirit of a fairy, smiling charmingly at people.</p>
<p>Fallen flowers have a gentle and graceful posture, a洒脱神韵洒脱 神韵潇洒 divine charm, and a light and agile dream. Fallen flowers symbolize the yearning of poets and girls.</p>

<p>— Meixue</p>
<p>Recently, the most sensational giant novel in society</p>
<p>is Cheng Zhanlu's</p>
<p>"Dark Heaven". The first batch of books arrived in Suzhou, and more than 100 copies were sold out in two or three days. Its attraction is greater than that of "The Four Heroes". Wang Xuechen commented on this book, saying: "Mr. Cheng has always been on the front line of 'the times' and has always held the authority in the literary world." He also said: "Dark Heaven is progressive, in line with the trend, and full of 'the spirit of the times'." It is appropriate that it has become popular without being promoted, and there is a trend of every family reading it.</p>
<h3 id="e312">Watching the Lantern Procession in Chang'an <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>This time the author went from Pinghu to</p>
<p>Chongde, riding in</p>
<p>a car. Originally, he could have arrived on the same day, but unfortunately, the</p>
<p>car from Hai Ning to Chang'an broke down</p>
<p>and delayed my journey. Later, I changed to a steamship, and when I arrived in Chang'an, it was already dark. The boat connecting to Chongde had long disappeared without a trace, but Chang'an was holding a grand lantern procession. I happened to arrive at the right time, so I stayed overnight in Chang'an. The lantern procession is very popular in the western part of Zhejiang, and it can be said to be a kind of entertainment for the common people. The authorities were afraid of affecting social order, so they had stopped it for more than ten years. Recently, various places have felt the economic recession, so they thought of welcoming the lanterns again, or it could revitalize the market. Xiashi, Haining, Chongde, Jiaxing, Zhouwangmiao and other places will be held one after another, and Chang'an is just opening the end. The Chang'an lantern procession starts on the 17th and lasts for four days. There are a total of sixteen platforms, which are divided into sixteen groups and united together to welcome. Each has its own lanterns and its own characteristics. It starts at 7 pm and will welcome the lanterns until 2 am. Among them, the Pinfangtai building tower is full of electric lights on the tower, which light up for a while and go out for a while, which is most appreciated. There is also a group of Qixi pictures, with accompaniment of fine music in front, and the melody is moderate. It is still quite pleasant to listen to. Other things such as lions,涼亭麒凉亭麒lions, pavilions, unicorns, etc., are connected together, which is very long. Of course, there are many viewers who express welcome. There are also not a few who feel that this kind of lantern is too vulgar. There is also a kind of slogan on the lamp, which can be said to express the thoughts of a part of the common people. The slogans are "Silkworm flowers are luxuriant", "Celebrate the rising peace together", "Enjoy with the people", and "Four seasons of peace".</p>
<p>All hotels and restaurants took the opportunity to raise prices and make a fortune. The single guest room that originally sold for 4 jiao was raised to 1.2 yuan. The price of side dishes also doubled compared to usual. The reason they raised prices was that the hotels and restaurants bore a lot of expenses for this lantern procession. Therefore, they had no choice but to think about the tourists.</p>
<h3 id="e313">Wuxi Flower Garden <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>The weather is clear and sunny, the spring scenery is brilliant, and Suzhou and Hangzhou, known as paradise, have become the focus of travelers, feeling exceptionally lively. This time, I and a few friends agreed to travel to Wuxi, planning to spend a full day and return to Suzhou on the same day. Once the agreement was set, we took a special express train at nine in the morning. After the train started, we saw the shadow of Tiger Hill Pagoda, towering into the blue sky, as if waving goodbye to us. Gradually it became farther and smaller, quite charming. Soon, we were immersed in the rural scenery, as if walking through a painting. Before long, we could see Xishan in the distance, and saw factory chimneys, as dense as a lush forest, showing the prosperity of industry.</p>
<p>Because we had to visit Meiyuan first, we took a streetcar to Yinglong Bridge, then changed to a car, and went directly to the garden gate. The garden is located in Dongshan, west of Kaiyuan Road. It was rebuilt by the industrialist Rong Desheng on the site of the peach orchard of Xu Dianyi, a Jinshi in the Qing Dynasty, and planted extensively with plum trees, hence its current name. Entering the gate, you immediately see a huge stone, engraved with the two characters "Meiyuan." As the road gradually advances, the ground gradually rises, and through the winding flowers and trees, passing Xixin Pavilion, you can climb to Tianxing Terrace and see Taihu Lake. Further up is Xiangxue Xuan, where one can sit and recite poetry, and around it is Liuyue Village and Little Luofu, facing the ultimate peak of the mountains. The mountain scenery and lake light are open and lovely, and the sails going up and down are especially magnificent. Thus, a poem was born: "Leaning against the clear sky at the high point of Meiyuan, the mountain scenery and lake light are all in sight, most of all the sails are infinitely beautiful, natural poetic material that is difficult to paint."</p>
<p>Halfway up the mountain is the Taihu Hotel, providing meals for guests. Because it was past noon, we rested in the hotel, gathered around a round table. Although the dishes were not excellent, our appetites were better than usual. After a full meal, we went down the mountain and out of the garden, and took a car to Little Ji Mountain. The mountain is west of Little Penglai, surrounded by water on three sides. In summer, it is known for its lotus flowers, making it a popular summer resort. Unfortunately, the architecture mostly adopts European styles, failing to avoid vulgarity. Looking from afar at Yuantouzhu, the green trees are lush and shady, and the yellow walls are faintly visible. There is a small ferry available, but because the wind suddenly picked up and the waves were extremely large, and we also had to tour..., we did not go. Another poem was born: "Driving straight up Little Ji Mountain, a corner of a pavilion beside the water bay, pointing remotely at the famous scenic spot of Yuantouzhu, the good wind sends back the sound of the waves."</p>
<p>The garden is located on the edge of Five Mile Lake, and was the villa of Wang Yuqing, a Wuxi native. We took a car to go there, and the journey was extremely long. Once there, there were Thousand-Step Cloister, Hanbi Pavilion, Lakeside Thatched Cottage, and other scenic spots. The red railings and green balustrades are exquisitely structured, and the Stone Embankment, Snow Wave, and other mountains are arranged like screens. Along the embankment by the lake, the willow branches spread green and the flower buds stretch red, resembling the edge of West Lake. Between looking up and down, I continued to get a poem: "The scenery by Five Mile Lake is clear, the Su Garden willows are dark and the flowers are bright, the thousand-step cloister has three overlapping peaks, stirring my leisurely, otherworldly emotions."</p>

<h3 id="e314">Village Gleanings (3) <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>(3) Village Education</p>
<p>Generally speaking, everyone has some unique quirks, or perhaps what is called personality! In life, there are things that one absolutely will not do, things that one must do, things that are optional, and things that are better done this way than that way. Belonging to the latter, I have a very obvious quirk, which is that I would rather listen to an old woman chanting the Amitabha Sutra than talk about world affairs with a village pedant.</p>
<p>World affairs are inherently difficult to talk about, but if you talk about them with a village pedant, there is even more suffering of "unspeakable." Every time I return to my hometown, apart from looking at the farmers' operations and talking with the elders about the village situation, I rarely interact with these people.</p>
<p>But the "good words and deeds" of the pedants will certainly not be "buried and unknown" because of my non-interaction.</p>
<p>In our village, there is only half a person who can be called a pedant, and that is the teacher hired from another county for the village school. The reason why I say half is not only because he is not from the village, but also because he does not have the talent of a pedant, but has the views of a pedant; he does not have the lofty detachment of a pedant, but has the arrogance of a pedant; he must occupy the upper seat at banquets, and when he sees the school directors, he bows and stands like a servant, his pedantic and sour demeanor is all too obvious. When teaching, his pronunciation and meaning are so vague that even a few elementary school students cannot cope with it.</p>
<p>But he is still able to continue teaching.</p>
<p>There are a total of seventy or so students in this school, and there are two teachers. The other one is nominally the principal, but what he manages is village affairs, not school affairs. He is busy being the secretary of the school directors, the strategist of the village head, and a guest on the seats of the gentry. He entrusts the seventy or so young students to our pedant as if entrusting orphans.</p>
<p>The motivation of the gentry to establish this school, is definitely not to promote education, but to save face for the village. To put it more clearly, it is to save face for themselves. This is not an initiative of a few gentlemen in a small village. I don't know how many gentlemen in the country are running educational undertakings to save face. This kind of behavior of seeking fame is originally not worthy of deep blame. But believing in these two treasures and neglecting children's education to such an extent is really unforgivable.</p>
<p>I inquired in several nearby villages and felt that their casual attitude towards children's education was really shocking. The private school system has passed, but the poison that presided over the private schools is still able to shake in the new school system. This is really a problem that urgently needs attention in the countryside. National affairs can be temporarily ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e315">Petty Cleverness and Great Wisdom <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>Great people generally have a certain understanding of life and the universe. No matter how talented a person is, they cannot reach this level without a very long period of experience, thinking, and learning. The achievements of scholars in the East and West are mostly after middle age, and that is why.</p>
<p>After having a solid understanding of many things, then in the course of life, there is a certain direction. Direction is not obtained by chance (except for buying lottery tickets, things in the world are rarely accidental). For example, gambling, there is also one's own intention in it. Usually, it requires careful investigation, rich experience, and decisive judgment -- in other words, it requires great wisdom.</p>
<p>Great wisdom is not necessarily innate, but is formed from acquired learning. And this</p>
<p>often requires going through some pain. The scholars who sought the Tao in ancient times, just looking at the Song Confucians, know how much hard work was spent. Or they went from the military strategists to the Buddhist family, and then from the Buddhist family back to the Confucian family; or they thought without eating or sleeping, and finally "investigated" bamboo but never understood it, and instead made themselves sick. These kinds of things seem so ridiculous to us modern people, but the efforts that the predecessors spent, taking a path that did not lead anywhere, and standing back at the crossroads to prove "this road does not work," saves later generations a lot of effort, and is still great.</p>
<p>But petty cleverness is different. This can be said to be "small talent." The difference between small and great is like the difference between pine and cypress and shallow grass, and the difference between rivers and seas and puddles; the difference between cleverness and wisdom is like someone who looks like a saint but is expelled by Zeng Zi; a kite can be made into an airplane, but it cannot carry people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people of our country today are all heading towards the path of petty cleverness. There are many scholars in Jiangnan, and once they step into the fork in the road of petty cleverness, there is no cure. There are fewer scholars in the north, but there is less of the atmosphere of petty cleverness. When a scholar is produced, he is a very great scholar.</p>
<p>The tendency of cleverness is to be quick-witted, delicate, lightweight, sparse, unwilling to work hard, and content with the status quo. These are all causes of decline and omens of destruction. Look at the figures of today, especially the "literati," who is not drifting here and there with a little bit of petty cleverness?</p>

<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>Covered with a network of red silk,</p>
<p>a pair of excited eyes wide open,</p>
<p>like a woman defiled ten thousand times, swollen eyelids unable to hold calm. No charming stars can be found in the sky, unable to point to the Big Dipper to determine the seasons, unable to distinguish the silence of the vast Milky Way, unable to see the rosy clouds embracing the moon: countless lights exchange in mid-air, like countless hearts beating to the extreme. Hellfire burns on the ground, a large, chaotic shadow running for life, heels seeming to fear getting stained with flames. Fire dragons streak across the ground, with a bit of a frantic roar; dappled tigers rush around, shining a pair of terrifying eyes; eight hooves rush forward desperately, unable to care for the peace of a balanced carriage; rickshaws are the most clumsy and pitiful, like an ant dragging a mantis, a piece of floating music enclosing the city, a demon using polyphony to proclaim evil. Such an ancient taste, unable to tell its dreams: dogs barking at spring stars in the deep alleys, a cock crowing at dawn, light dreams lingering around the dying lamp, the sound of the night spun out on the spinning wheel. The colorful lights in the venue shine dizzily, illuminating the fluttering robes of the immortals, the singing floats and sinks with drunken hearts, who still thinks this is in the night? The factory machines turn human hearts, also holding joy, the grinding sound, shaking people's souls like raindrops hitting duckweed, staggering in a daze, this city night is really worth praising, it is both hell and heaven, it is still generous and impartial,</p>
<p>overflowing with clear songs, and not covering up the suffocating breath, really want it to have a happy explosion,</p>
<p>to find some peace in the ashes.</p>
<h3 id="e317">Essay and Novel <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, it is the novel, rather than... that has been able to express the various demands of the Chinese people in large quantities. The social significance of "Water Margin", "Journey to the West", etc. is also greater than that of "Yuewei Cottage Notes", etc. From the standpoint of writing, the short essay has indeed been successful in the past decade or so. However, one cannot just discuss literature from the writing. I think it is good to write short essays seriously, but one cannot regard short essays as a "panacea."</p>
<p>Hamilton's "Theory of the Novel" contains many places that can be criticized, needless to say, because it is a product of a certain era. However, reading it once is better than not reading a single book. And if you can get a more advanced methodology, that is naturally better. Anarchism in creation methods is not very good. And the "character" who chanted "the novelization of essays", it is still a question whether he has read Hamilton. If "the novelization of essays" is really "the natural order of things," then</p>
<h3 id="e318">"Han Hai" <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>"Han Hai," twelve volumes, edited by Shen Xihou and appraised by his teacher Chen Meigong, collects more than a thousand letters from the Zhou case to the Ming Dynasty, with Ming letters accounting for four-fifths. It is a Ming edition. Its compilation uses a classification method, separately divided into twelve parts: emotion, beautiful words, self-narration, interpersonal affection, medicine, anger, leisure, reclining travel, literature, statecraft, and good words, each part with several types. The selection criteria, according to the example words, say that "vulgar and corrupt words in the letters are not worth bothering the subordinates, and should be erased by hand. As for the bones being icy and the red clouds reflecting the sun, those that move people's hearts should be collected immediately." However, although the selection is excellent, it is still inevitable to have one or two shortcomings, that is, occasionally the selected person's travel notes, essays, etc. are also included as letters, and the author's famous... are inconsistent. For example, Hongdao is sometimes called Yuan Hong, sometimes Yuan Shigong, and sometimes Yuan Zhonglang. I cannot agree with these two points.</p>
<p>The book has a preface written by Chen Meigong on "the first day of the fourth month of the Gengwu year of Chongzhen." Its main points are, first of all, pointing out that the letter item, after Yang Yongxiu and Wang Shizhen's "Qingcai" came out, "there was no life." The so-called "lifelike" letters should be like "flying waterfalls hanging down, chaotic cliffs covered with the moon," "clear water as silk, recruiting cool beads, coming from places that people have not reached," "bright as a hundred houses," "witty words piercing the heart, obliterating sentences that are not painful or itchy." The selectors of "Han Hai" possess these conditions, so he "swims in the sea and picks it up." Secondly, he probably felt that letters and essays were not valued by the world, and said with emotion, "Tao Shihang used bamboo heads and wood scraps, to make a living: writing is neither big nor small. If there is a true spirit reflected on the paper, it is wisdom." In the final paragraph, he expresses his feelings about current affairs, saying, "Now that the beacon fires are about to be extinguished and the Rong rope is self-determined, composing poems is not a strategy, and the eight-legged essay is useless; I will think of a piece of paper from the Han Dynasty, which is better than ten thousand troops, and Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty's clear vision of thousands of miles is more than just playing with double fish." The introduction is not much, but Meigong's understanding of letters, his recognition of essays, and the era's bitterness hidden in his heart are all seen here. It is an important article by Meigong and a powerful document in the literary movement at the time, which we cannot lightly let go.</p>
<p>then, "Once you play with essays, it's better than reading ten thousand books," and the future will naturally be optimistic and "the world will be peaceful."</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Maoyong's opinions in "Novel and Essay" are not much different from what I have seen. I said that essays and essays are products of the aristocracy or the scholar-official class in terms of the origin of the style (Origin). Mr. Xu Maoyong is discussing the current situation. As for reportage literature, although its nature is similar to essays and feuilletons, is it the same in genre? Must be considered. The two are products of different social foundations. This article is not a disagreement with what Mr. Xu Maoyong said. Because someone is arguing against what Mr. Xu Maoyong and I have said, so I wrote this article again.</p>
<h3 id="e319">A Glimpse of Bansong Garden <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>I like to read travel notes, and I often tell people about the benefits of travel: but in fact, I am not a very enthusiastic traveler. I have been in Shanghai for almost two years, and there are many places that I feel I should have visited but have not. Living in the city from morning to night every day, breathing in coal smoke, and listening to the noise of machines, I finally feel a bit disgusted.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the clear spring weather, I invited Lin and Lingling, and with a dry heart, went to Bansong Garden in Nanshi. When the car drove to Nanshi, Lingling said:</p>
<p>"This is Chinese territory."</p>
<p>Having lived in the quiet countryside at first, and then spending every day under the skyscrapers of the concession, seeing the cobblestone roads and small, old shops here, it was as if I had come to an ancient town. I wanted to recite a seven-character poem or a ci poem, but the car was bumping so badly: Lingling's body almost fell into my arms. Arriving at the entrance of Bansong Garden, it was a little after two in the afternoon. Lin bought our tickets, and we walked through the gate together, walking on a corridor.</p>
<p>Neither Lin nor I had been here before; this time we had to let the enthusiastic Lingling lead the way. I looked at her slender figure, thinking that her young, innocent heart must be very happy. We had only known each other recently; because of a small language barrier, I had not said many words to her. But, just now I had said these words:</p>
<p>"Lingling! I want to learn Shanghainese."</p>
<p>Yes, when I could speak Shanghainese, I could be friends with Lingling; aren't there many words hidden in our hearts that we can't say?</p>
<p>There were many antiques on display here for sale, and looking at the prices, they were not very high: it's just that I didn't feel any interest in these things at all. I am, after all, a city person, and although I feel bitter after breathing in coal smoke, I am also unfamiliar with mountains and water!</p>
<p>On a man-made river, there were small boats rowing; a warm breeze blew, and a smile appeared on Lingling's face. The water was green, and the reeds on both sides were also green. On the artificial mountain, a tourist wearing a melon-skin cap was singing "Wujiapo" loudly; on the bridge, a group of female students were folding photos.</p>
<p>"Let's take one too."</p>
<p>After hearing Lin's words, Lingling jumped to the lake. Many people were leisurely sitting in the pavilion drinking tea: I don't understand the pleasure of drinking tea very much, so I hurriedly went back to the river to row a boat.</p>
<p>A group of donkeys were running and braying over there, with women who looked like concubines riding on their backs.</p>
<p>There was also a gambling-like game field here, which reminded me of the second day after I first came to Shanghai, and what I saw in the Great World was also like this. Lin planned to spend a dime or two for Lingling to play something, but the result was that she didn't get anything!</p>
<p>In an instant, it was already dusk and twilight.</p>
<p>The quaint Bansong Garden could not keep me. Just like the beautiful West Lake made me feel lonely. Finally, I got back into the car, letting it drive at a speed of sixty degrees, rushing from the cobblestone road straight to the skyscrapers.</p>

<p>— Xi Ru</p>
<p>Afa finally made up his mind. He would try it no matter what.</p>
<p>He had made such a determination hundreds of times today, but every time he touched the money in his pocket, he would cancel out this courage. The money jingling in his pocket was a dollar and a few cents. And this dollar and a few cents had hundreds of uses, each of which was necessary and urgent.</p>
<p>There was no way, what could this money be used for? It was better not to use it at all, so as not to seem to look down on other uses. "If I win! Wouldn't that be...?"</p>
<p>He wasn't a fool, he understood that if he suddenly hit the jackpot, he would have a way to add hundreds more uses. Who could say that he, Afa, wouldn't have this luck?! Wasn't it just the other day when he was drinking tea at Good Food Restaurant that he heard people saying that the last first prize was won by a dock coolie?</p>
<p>Now it seemed that even the heavens would sometimes bless the poor.</p>
<p>He kept comforting and defending himself like this. He had already quickly turned from... shell to Kuaifu Street.</p>
<p>He knew the biggest lottery shop in the vicinity, called Xinglong Lottery Shop.</p>
<p>Two ground-based lamps, like door gods, stood opposite each other on both sides of the door.</p>
<p>The lanterns were as thick as two people could hug, a foot and a half long, the dim red candlelight hidden in the oil paper shell, like a pair of cunning eyes flashing. Pasted on the lantern shell were four red characters that were thick and flat, like several fat crabs stacked together: National Defense Expenses.</p>
<p>Afa walked to the door, hesitated for a moment, and immediately walked straight past it. What if he ran into someone he knew? They would definitely laugh at him in front of his face: Look at Afa, that poor wretch, trying to get rich quick! Hmph! Really, a toad wanting to eat swan meat! Hmph! No, no, he couldn't compare to the rich, who spent two dimes as casually as if they were spending a copper coin. He had to use these few dollars and cents until he found work again. There were so many people from the countryside coming to the city to look for work, just a casual glance on the street corner and there were dozens of them, squatting, standing, wandering, waiting for work, no, no, he had to save and use frugally, don't be so absurd!·····</p>
<p>He walked straight to Yidinghao Tea House. A burst of urgent string music rose from the third floor, and a female's sharp voice followed, beginning to sing. It was then that he realized that he had already passed twenty or thirty shops.</p>
<p>"What do you do? Go back or not go back and try it?" His heart was asking him. He hesitated. If he didn't try it, then wouldn't the determination of the last few times be in vain? Not trying meant that everything was unresolved, there was no hope, and he would be poor for the rest of his life! Also, maybe this time he would really win the first prize? If he didn't buy it and let the good luck slip away in his hands for nothing, wouldn't that be a wrongful death?! Anyway, he was poor, what did two dimes matter... He turned back again.</p>

<h3 id="e321">International Situation <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Gu She</p>
<p>Many people predicted that 1936 would be the outbreak period of the Second World War. Judging from the current situation, the realization of this prediction does have some possibility. The facts have already been revealed in this way: in Europe, disarmament has long reached a dead end, and the conflict between Germany and France, and between France and Italy, is becoming more acute day by day. Britain's policy of maintaining the European balance of power is currently useless. At the same time, in the Far East, there is the opposition between Japan and the United States, and between Britain and Japan. The unlimited expansion of Japanese imperialism has almost brought this opposition to a fever pitch, and the opposition between Japan and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>further complicates this problem. In this way, the eastern and western hemispheres are simultaneously shrouded in war clouds. We only see the diplomats of various countries, how they are strategizing and arranging this war situation. At the same time, the armaments factories of various countries are stepping up the manufacture of munitions. At present, it has indeed reached the point where "the mountain rain is about to come and the wind fills the building." The international situation is becoming tighter day by day, already forecasting that the god of the Second World War will soon descend on the world.</p>
<p>The struggle between France and Germany has long been the whole of the central issue of Europe, and with the addition of the struggle between France and Italy, this situation has become even more complicated. Hitler came to power, and the German regime, with the landlord bourgeoisie as its background, desperately needed to expand its economic hegemony abroad; France was its only fighter. What the French capitalists needed was to permanently grasp the monopoly situation on the European continent, so that all countries in Europe would be subject to their control. The rise of Germany was of course something they could never allow. In this way, the struggle between Germany and France was played out in an even more fierce situation than the Anglo-German struggle before the war. The struggle between France and Italy further transformed this European struggle situation into a triangular form, and intricately caused more complex effects. What Britain demanded was to consistently maintain the European balance of power, unite the forces of Europe, and deal with the United States. Unfortunately, this policy has also reached a dead end. How can this European struggle situation be relatively harmonized? This is what Britain is currently painstakingly planning to deal with. However, the objective facts show the opposite situation. The complete failure of disarmament, which can no longer be reversed, clearly indicates to people that the disputes in Europe can only be resolved through war.</p>
<p>Looking at the Far East again. The opposition between Japan and the United States is something everyone knows. The degree of opposition between Britain and Japan is no less than that of the United States. Japan's September 18th Incident had already opened the prelude to the Second World War, but at that time, various countries were burying themselves in preparations, so although Japan launched first, it would not immediately come into contact. Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs unofficially issued a statement that China must be exclusively dominated by Japan, and other countries are not allowed to interfere. This situation has entered a new stage. What remains a problem now is that there is still no tinder to ignite the fire. Once the tinder is obtained, the outbreak of war will be tomorrow's affair.</p>
<p>The Far East and Europe are simultaneously opening the prelude to the Second World War. The outbreak period is approaching day by day. At present, all that remains is for the war deployments of various countries to be completed, and then the bloody killing business will begin. Regardless of whether the period is in 1936, the world will inevitably go through an even more cruel massacre. And the present is the period of intensifying preparations.</p>
<p>When imperialism develops to its peak, there must be a war. Only war is its final way out. However, the opposite of war is decline. Regardless of whether it is willing, history will inevitably evolve in this way. Imperialism often makes itself its own gravedigger.</p>
<p>What about the Chinese people standing in this war crisis? China is now the target of their struggles. How to fight our way out of this war crisis is what we should be preparing for at present!</p>
<h3 id="e322">A Treasure of the Three Eastern Provinces! Ginseng! <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>Recently, news reports stated that the Japanese were harvesting ginseng in Jilin and had already transported large quantities into the mainland for sale. They have established management offices in Tianjin and Beijing, with a large organization, and are prohibiting people from the northern country from harvesting, which is truly heartbreaking! Whether or not land rights exist, we won't discuss, because the lost land of the Northeast has long ceased to belong to us. However, those who have always relied on ginseng harvesting for their livelihoods are now unemployed, and there is no prospect of a solution. It is a truly hopeless situation. As the old saying goes, "Better to be a dog in peaceful times than a person in chaotic times." Now, it can be changed to "Better to be a dog in a strong country than a person in a weak country." It is useless to bring up sad things, and pointless to talk about them. Let's talk about ginseng instead. I remember a northeastern saying: "The Three Eastern Provinces have three treasures: ginseng, deer antler, and Ula grass." In fact, the treasures of the three provinces are not limited to these. Apart from the natural development of mineral resources, there are also some treasures that are not directly related to the wealthy, so they are not valued by the world. Ginseng grows in the old mountains of Jilin, deep in the forests, but it must not be shaded by trees, and must be in a place where sunlight can reach it to grow. It is considered a perennial herbaceous plant, but in the history of Chinese medicine, it occupies one of the top three positions. Its uses are most closely related to the wealthy. In other words, it can cure almost any ailment suffered by the wealthy. It can treat all kinds of deficiencies, is warming without being drying, and nourishing without being heating. The slogans about its efficacy can all strike a chord in the hearts of the wealthy. But the poor have absolutely no connection with it. Even passing by a butcher shop, they cannot feast on it, but can only swallow saliva and sigh in vain. Just look at the ginseng shops facing each other in the second alley of Langfangtou in Beijing, their grandeur is no less than the remittance shops and silver houses of the past!</p>
<p>Ginseng is most valuable when it reaches fifty or sixty years old. Its "biography" can be roughly divided into six stages: one to five years, it grows one "掌子" (zhang zi, palm-like leaf); five to ten years, it grows two leaves, called "二來子" (er lai zi, two-coming leaf); twenty years, it grows three leaves, called "三台子" (san tai zi, three-platform leaf); thirty years, it grows four leaves, called "四品葉" (si pin ye, four-rank leaf); from thirty to forty, to fifty, and to sixty years, it goes through the names of "五品葉" (wu pin ye, five-rank leaf) and "六品葉" (liu pin ye, six-rank leaf), and naturally grows all six leaves. If the roots in the soil, the head, tail, and mother branches are complete, it may not be possible to buy one even for several hundred taels of silver. Most of the ginseng harvesters are from within the Guan (mountain passes), mostly from Henan and Shanxi provinces. They form groups of twenty people each. Before entering the mountains, assignments are determined, and they carry weapons to guard against robbers and wild beasts, like explorers. Those walking in a straight line keep a distance of over a hundred paces between each person in the group, calling out to each other to avoid getting lost. If one of them sees ginseng sprouts, they shout "棒棰" (bang chui, club/ginseng), and the companions behind ask, "What 棒棰?" The one who discovered the ginseng sprouts observes its appearance to determine what kind it is, and replies with "某棒棰" (a certain club/ginseng). At this time, everyone swarms forward, unanimously shouting, "拏!" (na, grab!). The procedure involves tying the ginseng sprouts with red thread, laying out oilcloth, and digging carefully around it while lying down, using a bamboo knife. The roots and whiskers must not be damaged in the slightest. If it cannot be completed in one or two days, they stay and guard it, waiting for the entire ginseng to be extracted. Then, they present offerings and kowtow to thank the mountain god. If the harvest is a large six-leaf ginseng, a whole sheep must be used as a sacrificial offering. Now that the Japanese have monopolized and control everything, not allowing Chinese people to participate, it is not known how they are digging ginseng. It is said that the matter of harvesting ginseng does indeed contain a semi-mysterious meaning!</p>
<h3 id="e323">Watching the Fun <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>Watching the fun is originally something our Chinese people value. Under a lonely lamp, watching people box, wrestle, and fight is certainly interesting; but a small quarrel between a couple of people on the street will often attract a group of passersby to surround and stare intently.</p>
<p>However, this only refers to things that can be directly seen within our line of sight. In addition, like hearing someone tell a bloody story, or seeing in magazines and newspapers that some people have been killed somewhere, or that some celebrity has caused some great disaster, it is also strangely interesting and fascinating.</p>
<p>If someone were to ask why people have this kind of psychology, I believe that it is probably because most people's hearts are too empty and too lonely. What they need is intense stimulation, like watching movies of lions and tigers fighting, or figure skaters dancing on ice.</p>
<p>Because this is the general psychology of modern society, a group of people who run magazines and newspapers, seeing this point, specialize in creating shocking news, or secretly attacking and slandering others, to please the readers. Moreover, some people among colleagues mark out different flags, attacking and scolding each other. From the lines of text, it seems as if they must fight to the death. But behind the scenes, they are shaking hands and laughing: "We are victorious!"</p>
<p>Originally, liking to watch the fun is not a very bad thing. If one can distinguish right from wrong and be inspired by it, joining the group of those who are making the excitement, becoming one of them, one would not be ridiculed as being like loose sand, or a cold-blooded animal. However, the people of our land of propriety and righteousness deeply understand the doctrine of the mean. Watching the fun is just watching. There is no expression when watching, and afterwards, it is forgotten as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>In recent years, exciting things have emerged endlessly in our China. This is truly a great blessing bestowed by Heaven upon our people who love excitement!</p>
<h3 id="e324">On Being Jilted <a href="#e324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>There is being jilted only when there is love. It's just that this is a pastime for leisurely young masters and ladies to spend their lives with eating and drinking. Poor bachelors rarely have this blessing. It is precisely because life is so leisurely that the days feel like years. They can only waste all their time completely on love, and they think that it is more important than any legitimate career. Love and life are almost becoming a two-in-one relationship. Without love, they simply cannot live, and if they unfortunately encounter heartbreak, then they are even more unable to live. This is especially true for the men. Once they are heartbroken, they are like soulless beings. This is not right, that is not right, causing them to eat without tasting, sleep restlessly, sighing all day long, the state of misery like losing their parents. Some even want to live and die because of this, feeling that since they are already heartbroken, everything is empty, and all thoughts are dashed. Life has no more meaning or value, so they bravely take sleeping pills, hang themselves, jump into the sea... they must destroy their lives. In fact, this kind of behavior seems a little "that" to me, and it is not considered clever. Or perhaps there are some with Ah Q-like spirits. Of course, I am not opposed to the men indulging in love, and I don't want to speak like a moral gentleman, saying don't take love so seriously and should do some meaningful things. It is true that love is an indispensable thing in life, but I think there is no need to be too serious, especially about being jilted. Being too serious is just asking for trouble, and pain is deserved, self-inflicted, and who can pity you? So being casual not only doesn't cause pain, but also takes advantage of happiness. Moreover, in this materialistic metropolis, love is gilded, full of the stench of money. As long as you have endless money, then I guarantee that you will be successful everywhere. All ethereal spirits are ghosts' talk. At the same time, women have become commodities, with a certain price, and they will pay you a certain quality of goods. Of course, there are also differences between miscellaneous sales and wholesale. But in general, it cannot escape the nature of buying and selling. Urban women mostly have a romantic character, despising chastity and integrity by thirteen points, and being fascinated by so-called free love. They have not gotten the benefits, but they have everything bad, liking novelty, stimulation, and activity. Today this one, tomorrow that one, in any case, there is no lasting interest, playing with love like a child's play. This is all a common prototype of fashionable girls currently in vogue.</p>

<h3 id="e325">The Trend of Aesthetic Attitude: Idealism <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Wenguang</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, some things changed, some turned left, some turned right; it seems that if they don't turn a bit, they are not suitable for survival.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say, "Everything can change, but people's aesthetic attitude will always find young girls or young boys beautiful, and not old women or old men with wrinkled skin and white hair, right?"</p>
<p>Now, let's not be too assertive. Facts are the most eloquent. First, let's observe how people's aesthetic attitudes have been trending recently.</p>
<p>In 1934, twelve thousand superstars participated in the Miss America election. The queen elected was May Wray, who was over sixty years old. The runner-up was Will Rogers, who was an old man. American men, who used to be fascinated by gentlemen and legs, have also changed their love. Their focus on aesthetics has shifted to paying attention to the performance skills and artistic contributions of the stars, discarding that materialistic aesthetic attitude. Otherwise, how could those flashy stars have lost the election?</p>
<p>The humorous master Lin Yutang said in his "Analects" that "Yun in 'Six Chapters of a Floating Life' is the most beautiful woman in China." As for Yun's appearance, it was not very beautiful. Her husband Shen Sanbai even said, "Her two teeth are slightly exposed, which is not considered a good appearance." It should be known that Mr. Lin's aesthetic focus is on the charm of language and the elegance of arguments. Yun possesses these two qualities, so we can well imagine her face being lovely, and it is no wonder that Mr. Lin would say that she is the most beautiful woman in China.</p>
<p>Zhang Liying was willing to marry Chen Youren because Zhang called Chen the most beautiful man in the world, and the conditions for beauty are: no whoring, no gambling, no drinking, no smoking, and good health. As for the ages of Zhang and Chen, although they were very much like a father and daughter, in the end, because of Zhang Liying's idealization of aesthetic attitude, they became a couple.</p>
<p>Do the above three examples not prove the recent trend of aesthetic attitude towards idealism? In other words, the materialistic aesthetic attitude, which was once considered immutable, has also changed. This "change" is, of course, progressive and revolutionary.</p>

<p>Fengchun sent the pearl to Ding Yuanwai and said, "This pearl was obtained by my father-in-law while fishing with a net; I am sending it to the Yuanwai to ask for an exemption from the fishing tax!"</p>
<p>Ding Yuanwai took the pearl and said, "Since this pearl was obtained from my lake, it is mine; the fishing tax must still be paid separately!"</p>

<p>— Jingjia</p>
<p>"… Sweet dream, deep love in the dream, love is strong…"</p>
<p>In the early morning, the alarm clock woke me up, and I lazily lay in bed, unwilling to get up. Spring is a cursed season! It always makes people feel weak!</p>
<p>A low "Sweet Dream" song came from the neighboring room, accompanied by the trembling of the moon guitar, the sound was so sad, making me feel a burst of bitterness on the tip of my nose.</p>
<p>I remembered my dream last night. Yes, there was a lovely dream, a sweet dream, that I had last night. I slept very late last night, and as soon as I fell asleep, I dreamed of the realm I loved. In the dream, I did not win the first prize of the sixth aviation lottery, nor did I make myself become a very powerful official. I only dreamed that I was leaning on the bridge railing of a certain garden, and on the opposite side of the bridge there was a cluster of emerald green trees, in the gaps of the lush branches there was a…</p>
<p>Beautiful girl's face, smiling at me, smiling quietly. The water waves under the bridge also reflected that cluster of trees, that face. We didn't speak, always sitting and smiling at each other, smiling, smiling quietly.</p>
<p>The dream unfolded, and I was no longer leaning on the bridge railing, and the beautiful face between the branches also disappeared. I seemed to be sitting on a huge lawn, with my hands clasped around my knees. There was a bright, round moon in the sky, and I looked at the lovely sky and that bright moon. Suddenly, in that round moon, I saw that sweet smiling face again. Nothing had changed, it was still smiling so quietly… A dark cloud rose up, covering the bright moon, covering that lovely face. The earth was enveloped in darkness… Then I woke up. The clock downstairs was striking four times. If it weren't for the song from the neighboring room, I would have forgotten that I had such a lovely dream last night. However, what's the use of remembering it? I am not in the dream now, that lovely smiling face is neither in the branches nor on the moon!</p>
<p>"… I wish to be in this dream forever…" I was dazed! I seemed to have lost my soul.</p>

<h3 id="e329">Two Views on Love <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>Since the banner of the women's movement was unfurled, a large group of women who had been oppressed in the deep continent for thousands of years have been able to obtain opportunities for liberation and run to society to enjoy various rights and obligations with men, shattering the feudal traditional thinking inherited for several years. The chains that weighed on women must therefore be gradually broken, and a new bulwark is being built on the future of women!</p>
<p>Although in the past, the union of men and women suffered from the pain of "parents' orders, matchmaker's words," women especially felt that the pain of those unions that had not undergone love was ten thousand times greater than that of men! The ancient teachings of "good horses are not matched with lame saddles, and fierce women do not marry two husbands" state that if a man feels the pain of "parents' orders, matchmaker's words" and is very dissatisfied with his wife, he can arbitrarily vent his sexual desires outside, or marry another wife, and society will not punish him, and he will even think it is an honor. If a woman suffers all kinds of oppression from her husband, and scolding from her in-laws, and feels great pain, she can only succumb to the whipping of etiquette and cannot say a word about divorce or remarriage!…</p>
<p>All the feudal and traditional poisons are gradually drifting away with the tide of the times! Therefore, the unreasonable system of union between men and women according to "parents' orders, matchmaker's words" in the past is now gradually abolished and replaced with a new look.</p>
<p>The union of men and women must go through the process of "love," what a wonderful noun! As a result, young people in general, relying on their own temporary enthusiasm, often run to two extremely different paths - "lovers of love above all else" and "extremists of sexual desire."</p>
<p>The so-called "lovers of love above all else" negate all materialistic theories. They believe that only love can promote their survival in the world. There is no life, no everything, without love. Love is sacred and inviolable, it is supreme. They do not know whether there are hungry people in the world, who do not even talk about love! Many female compatriots who are still trapped under the feudal forces, bound by the "three obediences and four virtues," have no chance to talk about love. Therefore, we must know that love is absolute and is limited by time and space.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about "extremists of sexual desire." In this week's women's corner in Shenbao, Jun Biyun said it well: "Some new-style young men and women, under the banner of love above all else, believe that the relationship between the sexes is not love, but only 'sexual desire.' So today they vent their sexual desires here, and tomorrow they go there to steal fragrance and jade. This is simply losing reason, and even…</p>
<p>These are crude and simple materialists who simply do not understand what is called 'love'." Based on her words, we admit that she said:</p>
<p>(1) Love is not supreme, but is limited by human life, the times, and society;</p>
<p>(2) Love is not inferior, just a thing to purely vent sexual desire, we have no way to completely deny the emotional role in love;</p>
<p>(3) Love is not only a combination of sex and emotion, but also a combination of life. Our love must be built on the basis of mutual understanding, mutual encouragement, and consistency of thought and action, and in life, we must not forget to work hard to improve human life and promote social work at all times;</p>
<p>Therefore, in the end, all phenomena of my party are rolling around in malformation and morbidity with the current system. If this entire system is not healthy, and the abnormal is used to solve the problems of this part, it is still difficult to be optimistic!</p>

<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>"How sorrowful, this autumn rain,</p>
<p>How sorrowful, I am sick at this time,"</p>
<p>It has been more than ten days since I wrote in my diary. I don't want to record these sad and bitter days of my life. If there is a day to destroy this diary, wouldn't everything be in vain? If it can survive with me, it will only cause my sadness in the future. The past is not worth remembering. Isn't my flower-like life going to be taken away by this autumn wind and autumn rain? I accidentally read a poem without a title in the newspaper, and I especially cherish the first two lines of it, so I wrote it here.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been like a hero going to justice. I enthusiastically helped my mother prepare for the wedding, and it seems that the days are passing too slowly. When the bridal sedan chair is carried out the door, isn't everything over? Why bother waiting until noon three quarters for the execution!</p>
<p>When he came, I also boldly joked and teased him. He advised me to be more stable and not so self-destructive. As long as I understood his heart, he would be grateful to me for the rest of his life. Ah, this poor man!</p>
<p>Today, relatives have all come to my house. This temple-like house suddenly became lively. Moreover, it is right for everyone to laugh with their mouths wide open when doing happy events. Hahaha, let everyone laugh. My mother lost a daughter, but brought back a son-in-law. This profitable business is worth doing for everyone. Congratulations, congratulations, I don't know how many hundreds of times I have heard it. Let me congratulate. Can the people in this world know that the person who is suffering the loss is destroying herself?</p>
<p>I put on a smile to deal with every relative, making their laughter and shouts of congratulations more than worth it. It was all for my sake that they were mobilizing everyone. They would no longer say that I didn't know how to appreciate kindness. This whole house is extremely lively. I should be proud that a girl who is about to be sold is the center of attention for these few days. Of course, the goods decorated in the tree window must be especially careful, so that the big customers can buy them back. Maybe they will be taken out of the dark warehouse and be able to swagger out in a car! As for their survival after going out, no one will think about it.</p>
<p>When he went back yesterday, he gave me a slip of paper, asking me to sneak out to the cinema today to meet him. What is this sneaky business again? I have to agree to him. In the afternoon, I made an excuse to buy leather shoes and took a car straight to the cinema. He was already waiting for me at the door. After buying two tickets for the balcony, we sat like a couple in love.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" I asked directly.</p>
<p>"I have a few words to say." He replied hesitatingly, that poor man! I held his hand tightly, "Xiong Ge, don't be so miserable, I can agree to everything for you!"</p>
<p>He grasped my hand gratefully. He seemed to have a lot to say, but he kept staring at my face, and finally said, "Do you love me?"</p>
<p>I almost wanted to laugh out loud, nodded, the lights just went out, and I snuggled in his arms. I was satisfied with these two hours of love enjoyment. My soul has been attached to his body, let this body that will rot away in an instant go!</p>
<p>When the show was over, he didn't dare to send me back. After I hired a car, he also left.</p>
<p>Last night, I sat alone at my desk until dawn before going to bed, wanting to write down some of the fantasies at that time, but I couldn't remember anything. Fantasy is not a fact after all!</p>
