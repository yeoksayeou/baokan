<h3>整頓駐外領事館之管見廷</h3>
<p>一國之常川駐外人員。有外外交官與領事官之别。領事官惟保護僑民．發展商務爲職責。其駐在國未有本國使節者。得兼充本國之對外代表。領事官之身分。雖不若外交官。然亦受國際法之特别保護。其所保管之公事文書。享受神聖不可侵犯之尊嚴。卽本人亦無充駐在國兵役及繳納直接租税等之義務。據國際慣例領事官之行使職權。當先得駐在國元首之認可。乃稱正式。如有非法或不正當之行爲。則駐在國元首可撤銷其認可狀。而間接解除其職務。故嚴格立論領事官實兼受本國及駐在國之節制。而爲雙方之官吏。其責任之重大如此。</p>
<p>充任今日之中國領事官。其所負使命。殆尤超越於其外國同僚之上。我國僑民遍於全球。歷年對於國家經濟．愛國運動．及内地慈善事業。多所補助。當今世界不景氣。排華慘劇。一演再演。政府當局何能袖手旁觀。領事館務之不容漠視。此其一舶來品充斥巿塲。漏巵待塞。國貨銷路鈍滯。奄無生氣。欲圖國際貿易之發展。非有消息靈敏之實地情報不可。領事館務之不容漠視。此其二。國民政府有鑒於此。故於領館經費則舉辦貨單簽證。以資挹注。於領事官人選。則厲行考試制度。嚴加甄别。凡此皆爲根本要着。可不待論。茲所欲言者。其重要不减於經費與人選二項。但或則爲當局之所不甚措意。或則雖經當局試辦。而未見繼續推行用特表而出之。</p>
<p>（一）服務規則之擬訂。領事官之任務。大别有四。（甲）發展商務。（乙）保護僑民。（丙）監視航船。（丁）其他瑣務。在此總目下之應辦事件。複雜異常。如（甲）項監視本國與駐在國之商務是否忠實履行。調查駐在國及其隣近地方之經濟狀况.金融巿塲.人民嗜好.等（乙）項注意本國船舶之入港及出港。調解或仲裁船員與水手或旅客間之爭執等。（丙）項辦理僑民登記。清查及保護死亡者之遺產等。（丁）項證明遺囑監誓參證婚禮．發給護照．簽證貨單等皆是。我國現行之領事服務規則。支離破碎。以視外．國之完美詳備。相差天淵。卽如華僑在外訂立遺囑者。爲數極寡。其在領事館之登記。又嫌不盡不實。華僑如一旦身故。其合法繼承人爲誰。往往無從查考。若身充領事者。對其遺產。不知代爲清查保護。則其一生汗血所得。必將爲地方政府沒收。而化爲烏有。但我國政府未有詳細規則。以爲領事館辦事之凖繩。縱有熱心服務之人。亦必無所適從而有進維谷之苦。此類情形。海外無地無之。我僑財產之損失。蓋不知凡幾。曷勝浩嘆。舉此一端。可見其餘。</p>
<p>（二）民事登記之推廣。華僑出國因迫於生計或移民苛例。未携家室者多。不幸發生事故。有須證明其與國内親屬之關係時。煞費周章。蓋我國之新式民事登記。辦理未久。且主其事者。敷衍塞責。視爲不足輕重。故駐外領事官。欲爲華僑親屬謀法律上利益之保障。每苦無證實其身分之證據。而有愛莫能助之嘆。有時駐在國官廳。准予通融辦理。亦須由領事館向國内輾轉設法。求得相當證據以取信於外人而自保其威信。故民事登記不實行。辱國累僑。爲害無窮曠日費時。猶其餘事。此事欲在全國同時並舉。而毫無遺憾。固不可能。但華僑以閩粤等省爲最多。而其原籍亦大都在兩省近海一帶。在此小範圍内。厲行民事登記。或不至十分困難。矧一經辦理妥善。對於本地庶政之改進。亦有裨益。不僅便利領館辦公及造福海外僑羣已也。</p>
<p>（三）巡迴考績之舉行。國府外交部。前有派員考察南洋各地領館之舉。於外交上頗爲有益。惟並未推行至於其餘各地。不無可惜。此後當倣效各國先例。委派公正幹練人員。随時巡視各領館之辦事成績。及其與駐在國地方官吏曁僑民間之關係。以爲奬勵及懲戒之根據。</p>

<h3>一夜流血後巴黎酷似戰塲</h3>
<p>至今仍在騷亂狀態中</p>
<p>示威羣衆數近五萬人</p>
<p>（巴黎）巴黎之美麗恊和街、經一夜之暴動流血後、今已酷似戰塲、巴黎仍在極不寗靜之狀况中、恊和街中遍地皆是鐵條鐵管及磚石等物、估計、暴衆數近五萬、　　各街中之破壞痕跡、在大可證明暴動之劇烈、外部現以步步一隊防護之、報紙有謂示威者中雜有共產黨、致釀成此變、法蘭西動作報、爲著名政治日報之一、今日出版之報、已被沒收、官塲發表昨夜騷擾中死傷數字、計平民死六人、衛兵失踪三人、平民傷一百七十人、警察傷一百八十人、衛兵傷二百三十人、國民教育次長巴敦今日辭職、右翼反對黨領袖已提出動議、要求立卽調查昨夜事件、巴黎表面現尙平靜、但空氣殊緊張、午後赴恊和街等處視察者、悉爲警察監視、不許停留、蓋遵守禁止集合之命令也、午後一時未續有亂事、亦未拘人、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>英國會辯論軍縮</h3>
<p>西門宣言努力調解</p>
<p>時局進展嚴重異點猶在</p>
<p>艾登赴法德意交换意見</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門今日在下院開始舉世注意之軍縮辯論、下院擁擠特甚、外交團多出席旁聽、</p>
<p>西門宣稱、自十二月二十一日以來、時局進展、英法意德四國皆公布重要文告、故時局至此已許作有益之討論、雖嚴重異點今猶存在、但對於共同根據、已有充分更大之接近、英國於已獲有可以再努力和解之充分鼓勵、此英國之所以於一月三十一日發表其備忘錄也、</p>
<p>軍縮關鍵在於法德之相互讓步、德國軍備平等之要求、未可拒絶、亦且不應拒絶、因欲將一偉大國家與民族久置人下、决無世界和平之可言、今不能獲得急切解决辦法、作爲各國立卽放棄其各種戰具如德國所不許置有者之根據、如恊定不能迅速成立、則英國將不得已而考慮其自己軍備、蓋以英國欲立身於軍備漫無限止之世界、無他道也、</p>
<h3>軍縮不成各國均有危險</h3>
<p>英國計劃可爲妥恊基礎　　西門又稱、英國備忘錄絶非、不顧及他人需要與焦慮之理想計盡、但以務實精神提陳於世、今日之時漸與主張軍縮者相背馳、英國計盡乃欲佈置一迅速妥恊之其礎耳、</p>
<p>英外相言及德國重置軍備事、謂任何公約必須迎合德國之重置若干軍備、但若許平等權利、而不在任何方面縮减軍備、則此恊定不爲英政府所歡迎、英國現不欲加入任何新約束、致不問環境如何、遽施壓迫行爲、英當盡其力忠實履行其已担任之義務、</p>
<p>西門陳説簽約國一致合作以杜防違約行爲之義務後、聲稱、英國提議乃一眞正之進步、此後步驟在使舉世人士完全了解英國備忘錄、及英國亦完全洞悉其他有關係國之困難、是以英政府現凖備委派掌壐大臣登儘速往遊巴黎羅馬與柏林、以説明英國之主張、並探詢他國政府對於英國備忘錄之意見、艾登本可立卽起程赴法、但法國政局有使人考慮、艾登以此行是否於法便利</p>
<p>西門末稱、英國自動將其軍縮之願望、見諸實行、已予世人以極顯著之證據、今猶以再行發起爲其責任、英國决定不顧困難、行其所能行者、以促成國際恊定、而用種種可能的方法、鞏固世界之和平結構、俾自己與他國免受恊定不定終必發作之危險與担負云、</p>
<h3>日本侵略中國世界安寗動搖</h3>
<p>工黨與自由黨議員</p>
<p>抨擊政府軍縮建議</p>
<p>工黨領袖阿特里稱、承認德國平等爲時已晚、且此係對强力而非對公理讓步、國聨政策鼓勵各國退出國聨鼓吹戰爭、以希兾權利、日本已爲世界各國之模範矣、世界不能於中日爭端伸其威信、安全之説乃掃蕩無遺、工黨所欲者爲安全與全部軍縮、今英國計劃、未能於此後十年間逹此止的、</p>
<p>自由黨領袖薩繆爾宣稱、英國之建議未能使人興奮、渠歡迎與意妥恊、以改善國聨、至於許德重置若干軍備一層、乃平等原則所必有之結果、此非對希特勒屈服、蓋德國歷届政府皆曾有此要求也、英國計劃如完全見諸實行、可使歐洲軍備减少、但歐洲縱依允之、遠東猶無把握、日本態度殆完全反對軍縮、日本迄未有接受所擬條件之表示、希望英政府不因一國之反對、而停止其進行、渠更以友好精神希望日本政府平心靜氣考慮其地位、蓋日本在外交上、因其對滿洲之態度、在經濟上、因其在世界贸易中之現狀、在道上與策略上、因其獨持異議、反對一般軍縮公約之行爲、皆處於孤立地位也、</p>
<p>保守黨康白爾主張銷滅戰爭原因、如支配不善之疆界等是、並建議設立國聨法庭、處理陳訴案件、而有國際空軍以實行其權威、至於海上軍備、祇須八千噸以下之巡艦、</p>
<h3>警告德國勿犯隣國獨立</h3>
<p>英政府不放棄代管權</p>
<p>西門祇承認權利平等</p>
<p>前外相奥斯丁張伯倫發言、謂德國與波蘭之恊定、旣未解除、德國前於國聨盟約．凱洛格公約．及洛迦諾公約下之義務、抑且增加之、此事殊可滿意、若德國同時不欲有事於奥國、則尤足令人滿意、若德國同時予德國以適當之警告、德國要求之接受須附有條件、卽德國不得以軍備之强力量或宣傳之强力對於任何他國之獨立表示侵略意國是也、前外相此言、聞者鼓掌報之、張伯倫又謂、今宜請德國直率説明其志願、庶他國可明示以限度、至於德國要求退還前殖民地一節、英政府無權放棄其代管權、如吾人須接受德國其他要求、則德國必撤國此類要求、俾獲妥恊、西門外相之德國軍備平等要求不可拒絶一語、渠認爲危險、渠願西門否認此語含有德國海上軍備平等亦可接受之意、政府黨聞之大歡呼、</p>
<p>外相西門乃起言曰、如余果用軍備平等一語、則實屬不當、余之原意乃對於軍備忘錄所说明者耳、備忘錄中已説明海軍乃另行談判之一事、掌壐大臣艾登代表政府答辯、謂奥國苟已决定將對德爭端提交國聨、則此案現無異在審判中、以後應採之行動應係國聨行政院所决定之、聨合行動、奥國有權可要求任何他國不得干涉其内政也、艾登又謂、英政府完全與意政府同意、以爲德國之復還日内瓦重行加入國聨、乃最重要要事、末謂英政府已請他國政府儘速接受軍縮提議、因在此時接受、可使世界獲得政治上最大利益、而引起人民間之最大信任也、政府動議延會、下院允之、辯論乃終止、（六日中透電）</p>
<h3>奥揆赴匈牙利</h3>
<p>此行目的揣測不一</p>
<p>維也納陶爾斐斯總理於今晨首途赴匈牙利京城、外部政務司長鮑爾柏拉茲曁匈牙利駐奥公使隨行、「聨邦郵報」評論總理此行、謂奥兩國共同政策、目的僅在於團結合作、决不在於反對任何國家云、「新維也納報」則謂意大利對於奥匈兩國贸易、准許假道意國脱利意斯脱港、以通至亞得里亞海、此種讓與權、將於總理此行中由意國方面表示云（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬匃俄復交條約、已於本星期二在羅馬正式簽字、按此項談判自一九二四年在柏林時開始後商定條約、但卒未批准、此次羅馬談判、係由蘇俄外長李維諾夫於其由美返俄途經聖城小駐時開始、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬匃牙利已正式承認蘇俄、惟蘇俄在明年一月以前、在匃牙利京城暫不遣派外交代表、在此時間之内、匃牙利將派榮格氏駐紥莫斯科、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>匃京據一般人推測、匃牙利承認蘇聯、乃由於意大利行動之所致、匃國承認蘇聯之談判、係在羅馬舉行、且小恊商各國、已凖備承認蘇聯、此次匃牙利承認蘇聯、意在居小恊商各國之先、又莫斯科政府旣在西方與匃牙利接近、最後當可加入國際聯合會、至就經濟觀點而論、匃國承認蘇聯、獲利雖不多、但匃國以前由小恊商國輸入之若干原料品、以後可購之於俄國、此外匃國所產之農業機器電氣播種機·牲畜等、則可向俄國輸出云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國各報對於俄國與匃牙利恢復外交關係一事、認爲有重大之意義、謂此種舉動、大足令人滿意、匃國此舉、正合德國歷來對俄政策之範圍云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>普安輪與英商輪</h3>
<p>昨在浦江互撞</p>
<p>普安船頭毁壞</p>
<p>頭艙破裂進水</p>
<p>英輪中艙亦損</p>
<p>今日公開檢騐</p>
<p>招商局青島班輪普安號、上次被盜騎刦、迄未破獲、乃該輪昨自青島來滬、駛進浦江、行至吳淞口内、與英商藍烟囱公司巨輪斐臘克太的號、發生互撞、普安船頭、全部毁壞、藍烟囱輪中艙部外舷、亦遭碰壞、已各停靠碼頭、俟今日由雙方所請公正人員檢騐、再定責任辦法、情形分記如下、</p>
<p>普安由青來滬招商局普安輪、自青島開來上海、船内裝載貨物旅客甚多、昨日下午一時、該輪駛抵吳淞、當卽開進浦江、凖備至浦東華棧碼頭停泊、起卸貨客、船主雷克斯．大副孫作人·等、均同至駕駛台當班、愼重行駛、一時零五分、普安開至閘北水電廠前、突與出口藍烟囱公司巨輪斐臘克太的Philoctetes號發生互撞巨禍、兩船均受損壞、</p>
<p>浦江兩船互撞英商藍烟囱公司斐臘克太的號、此次由利物溥運貨來滬、在上海卸去一部分物後、昨午、開往日本大連等處、駛至閘北水電廠前江面時、與普安輪相近、彼此均應側讓、據招商局船務科主任趙雲台君語記者、普安與英輪因互相避讓、而致不愼、遂致普安輪與斐臘克太的號船身、突然緊靠相近、不及避開、而乃發生猛烈碰撞、</p>
<p>雙方受傷情形互撞之際、普安輪船頭與英輪斐臘克太的號左外舷中艙、猛撞一下、急由兩輪船主、互開倒車、時普安輪船頭左側面、已被英船撞凹、船頭龍骨、亦經撞折、而在船頭之水綫間、且將鐵板撞破、裂開一</p>
<p>洞、面積甚巨、頭艙内已經浸水、損壞程度甚巨、英輪斐臘克太的號左舷中艙外鐵板、亦經撞壞、其損壞程度、則比較普安略輕、因中艙滿載貨物、故損害亦匪淺鮮、</p>
<p>派員到輪勘騐出事後、普安急開至華棧停泊、英輪亦中止出口、駛回藍烟囱碼頭、各派船員、到公司報告、招商局在下午二時許得報、船舶科主任趙雲台偕工程師張耀·黃宗倫·二人、親搭小火輪至浦東、上普安輪勘騐、並向船主雷克斯詢問肇禍狀况、當將損壞處、由張黃兩工程師騐明紀錄、至於撞碰狀况、因有責任關係、尙須候公正人、於今日檢騐後、方可决定、一時未便宣述、</p>
<p>報告滬港務長招商局已將此事、向海關港務長報告、藍烟囱公司亦由其船主報告上海大班、轉呈港務長、以待檢騐、普安船由青來滬、乘客當卽如數上陸、用小火輪送至新關碼頭上岸、船内貨件、照常出卸、至輪勘騐情形之船舶科主任趙雲台君、與張黃兩工程師、至晚六時、始克返局、當晚卽轉報劉總經理矣、</p>
<p>今日公同檢騐關於兩船撞碰責任、及其撞壞程度、與雙方損失、已由招商局及藍烟囱公司、各向承保船舶保險公司報告、卽會同各保險行各聘公正人員、於今日同至兩輪檢騐、並查問兩輪船主行駛狀况、與如何發生碰撞原由、以備公正人員、斷定責任</p>
<p>普安提早停修據趙主任言、普安輪因爐子須搪、原擬下班乘廢曆新年停班修理、今旣發生撞碰之事、則該輪須提早停航、俟本日經公正人騐明後、便卽拖進船塢、實行修理矣、</p>
<h3>上海港初見匈牙利船</h3>
<p>與歐洲各國通商以來第一次</p>
<p>字林報云、自中國與歐洲各國通商以來、昨始有匈牙利第一輪船東方號駛至中國、而入上海港、該船原爲英船特里茄丹號、淨重二七二二噸、有排水量八千噸、一年前始由現主人購得、雖在匈京註册、但不能駛至該地、因其體量不能駛入多瑙河也、船中除火夫七名爲阿刺伯人外、餘悉匈牙利人、此次由黑海羅馬尼亞蘇列那港載小麥七千五百噸起椗、經過哥倫布與新加坡等處、航行足五十五天、而抵上海、現泊招商局東碼頭、正在卸貨、至少將留滬十日、然後將駛往大連、大約將裝運大豆、據該船大副伊諾昨語字林報代表稱、匈牙利共有海船五艘、一月前有亞巴特號沉於印度洋、現僅餘四艘、歐戰後、匈牙利土地三分之二强、按照條約、分割與其他各國及新成諸國、其唯一海口阜姆、因以喪失、故諸船雖懸匈旗、而均不能與祖國一面云、</p>

<h3>前新省政府秘書</h3>
<p>鍾英談南疆變亂原因</p>
<p>該處用兵不易</p>
<p>前途未可忽視</p>
<p>新聲社云、南疆獨立消息、業經各方證實、新聲社記者、昨特往訪前新疆省政府秘書鍾英君、探詢詳情、據稱各節如下、</p>
<p>變亂原因據鍾君云、余因南來已久、故近况已極隔膜、惟南疆方面、在過去情形、凡喀什噶爾之纏回、對省政府之命令、絶對服從、故相安無事、而該區域内、漢人甚少、纏族咸信仰回回敎、故無一非回回敎徒、但該項敎徒、以經商者居多、此外有黑黑孜者、亦係纏回一種、在阿富汗及蘇俄之邊境、另存一部落、平時與蒙人相同、慣度遊牧生活、性較强悍、故此次變亂中遂有黑黑孜兵、曾一度佔入漢城、在施屠殺、旋又退出、原因未明、但猜想此次變亂原因、當不外因乘新亂無睱顧及之故、趁機稱變耳、</p>
<p>用兵甚難惟若用兵、其中尢以給養一事、最爲困難、蓋喀什噶爾距省城甚遙、交通亦甚不便、若用馬車途行、須一月之久、方能到逹、自迪化至疏附、其途有二、一由迪化經庫車、一由迪化經吐魯蕃、中隔塔里木盆地、（卽大戈壁）其地係沙漠之區、不能行軍、繞道而行、路途旣遠、諸感困難、故此次事變、事實上雖甚簡單、但亦不可膜然視之、蓋所虞者、其動作或有背景、而當局頗有鞭長莫及之難、目前惟一要着、希望中央有迅速處置之方、則敉平自亦較易、否則夜長夢多、前途正未可忽視也、</p>

<h3>華商紗廠本年難樂觀</h3>
<p>復興農村方爲治本辦法</p>
<p>日紗傾銷我受重大打擊</p>
<p>據棉紗業界消息、去年各地紗廠產銷狀况、已由全國華商紗廠聨合會分發調查表、尙未集、惟據一般情形觀之、上海之紗廠業抵抗力雖較强、但日商積極擴充及競爭、將予我以重大之打擊、本年之情况、仍難樂觀、茲錄其所談各節如下、</p>
<p>上年各廠盈餘者少據談聨合會調查各地產銷情况、每年舉行、以便稽核一年内全國紗業之狀况、現已發出各種調查表、惟各廠仍有墨守成規、在舊曆年底結算者、故總表尙未能彚集計算、惟據一般情形觀之、上年内各廠能獲盈餘者甚少、蓋花貴紗賤、外貨傾銷、及各地社會之不安、均予紗廠以重大之打擊、在上海之各廠、抵抗力較强、故尙能維持、其在天津漢口青島者、甚有以存貨過多、以致停工者、</p>
<p>救濟紗價僅能治標日來紗價雖漲、約每包四元、但花價亦漲、每担五元、故以成本計算、漲價後仍屬虧蝕、况自前年九一八之變後、國内各地戰亂不絶、巿况凋敝、商業停頓、其影響至巨、</p>
<p>日商對我侵略步驟至外商之競爭、最有力者爲日本、其本年之計畫、係在青島添設工廠、在上海則擴充錠子、蓋日紗業其對我之侵略、在十五年時、係向内地發展、故當時在長江各口岸、均有紗廠之設立、旋以分設各地、遇有事變、應付困難、故最近又一變而向上海青島兩地集中發展、蓋上海居長江之口、可以控制全流域、爲其競爭之策源、青島則爲魯省之要港、可以控制華北、爲其傾銷之尾閭、故二十三年、我國紗業、仍不能樂觀云、</p>
<h3>國際貿易協會提請</h3>
<p>减低運法國貨稅率</p>
<p>對阿德門請願表中條陳意見</p>
<p>希望法國對我國貨减低稅率</p>
<p>申時社本埠訊、巴黎國際貿易恊會副會長阿德門·前曾函送促進中法商務之請願表、並請派定中國代表兩名、參加國際貿易恊會·查巴黎國際貿易恊會、上年開會、由國際貿易局函轉實業部令派選代表、旋以會期密邇、不及派員、此次該會所送請願表、並重請派定代表、已由巴黎總領事擬以盧芹齋·馬受百·二君、就近代表出席、部令貿易局、轉令商聨會、中國國際貿易恊會核復、據申時社記者探悉、中國國際貿易恊會、對於巴黎總領事、擬以盧馬二君代表參加該會、甚表同意、至巴黎國際貿易恊會請願表所述各節、該會經詳加考慮後、已擬具意見、轉請國貿局呈供參考、茲節錄其意見如次、</p>
<p>主張維持現行稅率（上略）該會（指巴黎國際貿易協會、下倣此、）所請减低法國特產工業品·如羊毛絨綫·毛織品·布匹·印花布·生絲織造品·人造絲織品·香水·脂粉·花邊·香檳酒·上等白蘭地·及乾酪·等之稅率一節、查關稅有財政稅與保護稅之區别、財政關稅、以充裕國庫收入爲目的、其稅率之高度、自有限制、保護關稅、則以保護國内產業、抵制外貨競爭、爲目的、其稅率之用意、自與財政關稅不同、然亦當同時顧全消費者之利益、而不超過必要之限度、且稅率過高、則走私在所不免、行政經費隨之膨脹、轉有得不償失之幣、我國自關稅自主以來、對於羊毛絨綫·毛織品·布匹·絲織品·人造絲織品香水·脂粉·乾酪·等之稅率、比較舊日稅率、確已增加不不、惟此項貨物、或含有奢侈性質、或雖非奢侈品、而並非法國之特產、因我國關稅條約最惠國條欵之作用、如將此項法國進日貨稅率减低、則其他各國之同類產品、皆得　　　沾、恐非目前所能辦到、敝會以爲在相當期間維持現行稅率、尙不失爲雙方兼顧之辦法、</p>
<p>贊成减低人造絲稅該會所請分别規定生絲及人造絲稅率、以人造絲係日常用品、請勿徵收過高稅率一節、查人造絲爲織品原料、且我國現時並無生產、其稅率自不能與天然絲相提並論、而應從低徵課、按在昔人造絲本爲從價値百抽五、民國十八年、增至値百抽十、以當時價格計算、約合每擔徵稅十兩有奇、二十年稅則、改爲從量課稅、每担徵五十八金單位、二十一年八月以來、又提高至每担七十三金單位、約合値百抽八十以上、稅率不可謂不高、印度之人造絲進口稅、僅爲値百抽二十五、日本則每百斤徵日金一百零一元、皆比我國爲輕、自歷次增稅以來、人造絲之進口數量、有逐年减退之趨勢、走私充斥、轉使正當商人蒙其不利、該會所述减低人造絲進口稅一節、從發展國内產業、擴充國庫兩方面觀察、尙屬可行、</p>
<p>商標權益不成問題該會所請保障商標權益、及各種商品原有之名稱、如香檳·白蘭地·乾酪·等一節、查我國商標法第六條規定、「外國人民依關於商標互相保護之條約、欲專用其商標時、應依本法呈請註册、」是法國進口貨物、業經註册者、本可受法律上之保護、此點不成問題、</p>
<p>應速裁撤出口機關該會所請减低各種中國重要輸出品之稅一節、查出口貨物徵稅、足使國產成本增高、而减損其在國際巿塲上競爭之能力、近世各國、除少數特產專賣品之輸出、尙有徵稅者外、對於一般貨物、非但免稅、且有給予獎勵金者、我國國際貿易、久處於入超地位、近年因喪失東三省一部份之貿易、且受世界經濟衰落、各國關稅壁壘增高之影響、入超之數、變本加厲、二十一年逹五萬萬元以上、二十二年、竟逹七萬萬元以上、前途危險、不可言狀、自應儘速裁撤出口稅、以爲亡羊補牢之計、</p>
<p>希望法國優遇國貨查國際貿易、旨在有無相通、關稅以互惠爲原則、方爲兩利、法國方面、請我國减低進口稅、敝會固深表贊同、然同時希望法國、對於我國輸往之貨物、亦能予以相當之優遇、查中法關稅條約所載、享受最低稅率之中國貨物、有純粹絲織品·純粹絲織項巾·純粹絲織縐紗·純粹絲網·純粹絲花邊·胡椒·辣椒·肉桂·連殻·及無殻荳蔻·丁香·茶葉·等項、而於輸法之大宗貨物、如蛋及蛋製品·花生·生絲·雨綢·草帽邊·猪腸·猪鬃·桐油·牛皮·銻·等貨物、尙未有明文刊入最低稅率、實於推中法貿易、不無阻碍、敝會甚望該會瞭解此項情形、　　法政府提議、將上項貨物、允予適用最低稅率、則於兩國貿易之進步、當可俾益不少、（下略）聞該會是項意見書、已函由全國商聨會、轉函呈國際貿易局、　　部、由外交部轉送巴黎國際貿易協會考盧、俾增進雙方貿易云、</p>

<h3>探捕奮勇彈如聨珠</h3>
<p>一盜格斃一盜成擒</p>
<p>北成都路義和里昨晚盜刦</p>
<p>三盜同來結果僅一盜兎脫</p>
<p>－兩行人中流彈受傷－</p>
<p>本巿自入冬以來、各處盜案迭起、甚至日有數見、幸全巿警政機關、追緝不遺餘力、故其破案亦至神速、但一班甘罹法網、鋌而走險者、人復如是、因此居户門禁、稍一不愼、卽爲若輩所乘、昨日下午六時三十分、北成都路義和里第四十八號某姓家正當合家晚膳之際、後門内突被竄進匪徒三名、一匪在後門把守、一匪及一持槍之匪直進内房、將衆人喝住、禁止聲張、並行看守、一面勒逼事主、交出鑰匙、由徒手之匪往各室搜刦、翻箱倒篋、掳掠殆盡、所有細軟錢鈔、被刦甚巨、約半小時、始飽掠而出、向南成都路方面逃逸、事主一見亟亟追出、並狂呼捉强盜、附近崗捕得訊、卽𢬌槍追趕、並狂吹警笛、時成都�</p>
<p>路捕房亦已得訊、急派中西探捕恊同追捕、盜等一見、急向該處陳家浜小菜塲方面逃逸、但斯時中西探捕亦已趕到、盜等情急、乃由持槍之匪開槍一響、於是探捕等亦同時發槍、彈如聨珠、齊向匪方射來、内中一匪、卽應聲倒地、被探捕當塲擊斃、未幾一匪亦受傷成擒、惟尙有一匪、被其兎脫、同時有行人南京人劉金榮、二十五歲、及本地人蔡榮根、二十三歲、因適於激戰時、經過該處、不及避讓、致被流彈中傷、劉傷左肩、蔡被彈擦傷皮膚、均經第二三一號西捕車送仁濟醫院醫治、並將傷盜押回捕房、略一詢問後、以匪身受有重傷、卽轉送醫院醫治、待愈後再行法辦、一面追緝在逸同黨、死盜待今晨報騐、事主方面、損失若干未詳、</p>
<h3>本年日有蝕四次</h3>

<p>上午七時初虧、至七時四十八分蝕甚、八時四十分復圓、第二次爲八月十日之日環蝕、環蝕帶經過南非洲、我國不見、（二）月蝕、第一次已於一月三十日夜十一時五十九分初虧、三十一日零時四十分蝕甚、一時二十二分復圓、第二次爲七月二十六日夜六時五十二分初虧、至八時十三分蝕甚、九時三十四分復圓、</p>
<h3>長江水再退</h3>
<p>蕪湖七尺九寸</p>
<p>向所罕聞之淺水</p>
<p>六公司船悉阻滯</p>
<p>本届長江水淺、爲歷年所罕見、下游水位最短時、退到八尺九寸、江輪盡遭阻停、至本月五日、江漢關宣告馬當南水道、比較原航老港水深一尺四寸、江輪可以通航、詎料至六日、南水道之水位又復減退至九尺八寸、詎意長江下游、昨日水更大退、發現從來未有之最淺紀錄、甚至千噸左右之船、亦不能通過、亟將情形、查報如後、</p>
<p>（下游水位大減）此次長江水淺、先在蕪湖、嗣後移到小姑山附近之馬當港、而該段之水位在最淺時僅有八尺九寸、致長江船過比者、除擱淺外、餘均拖底而過、及南水道可通滬、航界正喜出望外、詎祇一天卽已低落、然尙可勉航、不意今日下游蕪湖方面、水位大落、發見從來未有之淺水紀錄、僅有七尺九寸水頭、實爲長江水短之破天荒、</p>
<p>（發電到滬報告）昨日午刻、本埠三北輪船公司接到蕪湖分公司發來急電、謂長江下游自六日夜中起、蕪湖一帶、水位驟减、今最淺之處、僅有七尺九寸、較馬當老港水尺尤爲短淺、不特較大江輪、無法通行、卽三四等船、亦難航駛、蓋長江船之最小型、其空船吃水、亦須八尺以上、除非上游之淺水級輪、方得勉强上下也、</p>
<p>（各公司輪被阻）前數天馬當淺水、滬上六公司、江輪、猶能開到案慶卸駁貨客、用小輪曳引、拖底壓泥而過、今次蕪湖退水到七尺九寸、各輪公司之上水船、卽駁空貨客、亦難拖過、祗得上下兩處派駁船轉運、而長江輪改爲半途之接載退航班矣、三北公司之靖安輪吃水最淺者、昨日蕪分局電告、該輪亦不能過此淺水段、</p>
<p>（淺水期内損失）本届長江水淺、上下游同時阻斷、記者本日遇捷江華主任魏．勞．二君、據言去歲長江線内各輪公司先受營業之損失、迨至上月、又遭水淺之阻碍、上下游各江輪之被淺水阻停、全部江輪受滯期誤班等影響者、何止五六十輪、每船每班多阻兩天計、便須額外損失四五百元、自退水至今、已歷三星期之久、各江輪擱淺者有之阻滯在途者有之、輪公司加收區區淺水費、殊不足供拖駁小工之資、總計二十餘日之淺水江輪之損失、誠覺驚人、今蕪湖又落至七尺九寸、則輪局之暗虧正未有艾也、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論學習語文（續二）</h3>
<p>來函說；「希望能够看懂一切的古籍」因而村讀古文，我們也不以爲然．因爲我國古籍浩如烟海，眞僞龐雜，尙待整理，初學的人不能讀，不勝讀，而且越讀會越糊塗，這與我們實際生活又何補呢？此其一。第二，讀不懂一本古書的原因，大約分爲兩種；一種是文字上（讀古書不僅要懂得文章的組織句法，還要考究訓詁詞句）的不懂，另一種是内容上的不懂（如哲理經義）要看懂古書固然要先求看懂文字，但往往文字句句明白，文章内容竟完全不了解，也不是罕有的事。所以足下要讀古書並非單　文字所可奏效，其他學識的修養同樣是必要的。譬如你讀不儘新詩，恐怕不是句子的懂，因爲「現代」中的新詩句子並不怎樣古怪，主要的許是你對於這種詩所含蓄的「意思」或「意識」之不能領悟。一時代有一時代的意識，這是自然的道理。而文字和語言又是表白意識的工具。意識一變，工具也是要改變的－－舊的工具表白新的意識是不行的。這不但在用字方面是如此，就是文章組織和逹意方面也是一樣的。嚴幾道用古文翻譯原富，他的古文技巧是很好的，但仍感到縛手縛脚。他爲了文字的原故，把源富的本意改動或變換了不少，竟不能很精確的自由的逹意。</p>
<p>在原則上討論了不少，現在答覆你所詢的五個問題；</p>
<p>（一）這是不成問題的，從你所寫的信看來，文章雖不能算是怎樣好，便亦很通順，所以你的願望並不奢。</p>
<p>（二）初學古文的讀物，主張不一，我們以爲就是姚鼐古文辭類篆也可用作讀物。但最好還是將「開明」「北新」選文中精選數十篇熟讀在心，古文基礎就儘够了。至於深造，就得遠追「諸子」，「雨漢」；「通史窮經」。不過這些精力，你實在不應在今日再去白費了。</p>
<p>（三）作文應做那一類，我們不能替你斷定。要看你自己希望，或願意做那一類文章。不過在初學時應多做叙述體的散文，最好是用白話。因爲這是作文的基礎。</p>
<p>（四）商務函授學社内容，我們不詳，你可問它要份章程和問問對於它的内容熟悉的人。</p>
<p>（五）這個問題我們不能答覆，因爲你要看些什麽性質的書，我們不知道。不過，我們的意思，現代中國青年，不論是抱着何項願望，都宜看些社會科學常識書籍。因爲人是社會的動物，我們對於這個社會，總須要有正確的認識纔能適應生存。</p>
<p>總之：我們對谥學習語文有兩個根本主張，卽（一）應讀現代文（二）同時並應努力擴充學識。因爲懂了現代文，旣切合於實際生活，就是以後要想讀古文古書也不見得要大費力氣。或者還可較之從古文入手省力些。一切學問都需要由淺入深，而愈與我們生活環境接近的事物也愈使我們感到興趣，所以不論讀者是讀什麽科目，我們都主張他由現代入手。至於擴充學識，更是必要的事，因爲現在有許多人寫不出文字，自己往往以爲是文字不能逹意，其實大多數是沒有系統的思想，換句話說，是無意可逹。所謂文章，是一篇有組織的思想的表逹，自然片斷瑣碎的觀念慢做不出文章了。所以卽使是個文章技巧很好的人，例如一個散文家罷，若要他做一篇經濟學文章（假如他無一點經濟學知識）是决計不能的。卽使做出來，也一定不是一篇好文章，因爲文章的好，並不單靠句子修辭的好啊！</p>
<p>所以我們希望凡學習文字者，都不要忘記文字是傳說思想的工具這個原則。文字基礎不好，固然缺乏一種發表自己的意見，的手段；但有了工具的技巧而無思想的　鍊也是做不出好文章的。</p>

<h3>僞</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>排字房裹的鉛字，也跟着洶湧的潮流而起着變遷，昔日聨絡成文的「奉張」「熱湯」等字樣，在報紙第一頁上佔着重要地位的，現在都成了歷史上名詞，再也不會發現在報紙裹面了！以前，排字房裹不大用的一個「僞」字，現在，大起眘忙頭，沒有一天的要聞裹面，不有這個「僞」字在出風頭，在露頭面；不過，報紙上的「僞」字越多，時局越感受着不寧，一般閱報的人，越覺得頭疼腦脹，有種種說不出的苦痛！</p>
<p>關外的僞國，已演了兩年的傀儡戲了；近來變本加厲，又要從僞滿洲國，而成爲僞滿洲帝國；從僞執政而成爲僞皇帝；從僞大同年號而成爲僞乂年號；因此遂有聨帶發生的僞省制，僞官職，僞宣言，惟及一僞而無不僞的種種色色；左一個僞，右一個僞，已很費着排字先生的手腕，而猶不止此。</p>
<p>關外的僞正閙個不清；關内的共產區域，有僞政府，僞軍師旅長，以及種種色色的僞名詞出現；共產區域的僞，還沒有洗滌淨盡，而閩變聲中，又產了多量的僞，一僞而無不僞的種種色色；閩變蕩平，已告成了一段落，而孫殿英又有組織僞寧夏省府的傳說；排字先生才把僞人民政府的字樣拆去，而僞寧夏省府的字樣又將代興！以何因緣，這個「僞」字，在報紙上竟大出風頭？</p>
<p>照這樣的風頭出將下去，排字房中的「僞」字，總不免要「求過於供」，而感受着缺乏；其勢，非添憢多量的「僞」字不可！非把昔日常用而現在不大用的鉛字重行還爐，而改澆多量的「僞」字不可！雖然，我儕小民對於時局的希望，不宜過分悲觀，只宜在無可樂觀之中而强抱着樂觀。怎樣的樂觀呢？只求排字房中的「僞」字，從此「供過於求」，而不是「求過於供」，這便是我儕小民的樂觀主義了。</p>
<h3>臘屐隨筆</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>游子久客，師期甚暫，十載未展祖塋，心滋愧恧。冬間，得鄕里宗人來告，唯亭後戴塸墓道，墳了暱於烟霞，稔子姓頻年却掃，陡起歹念，芟伐古樹，盜賣墳田，聞之大恐。雖滬務待理，假期促迫，祗有擺脫一永日，邀覲鼎兩叔重威弟及内子輔吉，冒風雪，乘小舟，放棹金計，風重帆破，阢隉不遑。追憶曩昔隨侍先君子，歲一蒞止，輕舸蕩漾，水波不興，春三四秋八九之月，影幽色霽，和風送暖，此時逈然不同矣。而况水雲香裹，别有耐人尋味之處，諸伯叔輩唱和酬答，風趣盎然，余時雖穉，亦知洗耳靜聽，頗多新意，何期勝會不長，徒縈今日之追索耶？乃者先君子墓木已拱，諸伯叔或以病廢，或修阻未能言旋，三四輩且先後師道山，興念及此，能弗潛然欲涕乎？諺有五年小變十年大變之說，洵不誣也。</p>
<p>洋澄浩淼無際，風帆點點，遠樹成烟，無腸公子所產地，遐邇所馳名也。其右曰金計湖，赴唯孔道，嘗聞之先輩言：元季金兀术敗困於此，水師數千，勢將絶食，四圍虎視眈眈，怯於追兵，戰無抵禦之術，必敗，守且坐斃，逃更無門。無已，與水師約，能於漏夜濬巨湖，放舟奔太湖，始有生望，否則同歸於盡，衆從之，日薄崦嵫，將士各持畚斗，通力合作，迨王鼓湖成，竟得脫，後人遂以金計名之。今有作金鷄者實誤。</p>
<p>金計毘連沙河蕩，長驅太湖，途程便捷，沙蕩面積廣袤，水色黃濁，有風浪高尺許，舟行惡之，蘇紳呂公，出私財用石工於金計沙蕩間，築石堤隔離之，水勢稍殺。堤長千尺，堅固卓絶，數百年來依然無恙，行人德之，在堤前建呂公碑頌揚盛德，並命堤爲呂公堤。</p>
<p>竹籬茅舍，雞犬相聞，田家之樂也；水鏡澄澈，扁舟垂釣，漁家之樂也。鄕行而後，每思買數畝田，築幾間屋，讀書習靜其間，無榮無辱，與世無爭，是殆桃源避秦人歟？會當於夢寐中求之。</p>
<h3>蹩脚戲</h3>
<p>— 朱思忠</p>
<p>從微風裹吹送過來一陣陣的胡琴聲，接着好像破竹筒喉嚨的京調，咦！這是什麽呀？我就開足腿力，跑過去一瞧，却原來是一對江北老夫妻，在那陳姓的屋角裹，大演其蹩脚戲。</p>
<p>男的掛上一綹玉蜀黍鬚似的鬍子，戴着一頂換糖都不要的繡花帽子，女的也戴着一頂垃圾桶裹找出來的開花帽子，一個拉着，一個唱着，男的有時還拿起一把錫紙均告脫離的樹刀，向空亂舞一陣，嘴裹接着……起倍……起起倍……的念着。這大槪是他們的經濟辦法，因爲多用一個伙計，當然要多去開銷，所以只和清嘴兒帮帮忙，權做鑼鼓手吧，反正爲爲去都爲着伊啊。</p>
<p>「不要臉的東西，這種醜把戲，祗有他們江北人做得出。」一位鬚髮蒼白的老頭子，捧着水烟袋，呼盧呼盧的走過來，看見了這樣的說着。</p>
<p>「巧弟！走了吧，恐怕一會兒，就要兜錢咧。」一位較長的姑娘，輕輕地將較矮的姑娘肩胛上一拍，並且這樣地說，就此一同離開了。</p>
<p>「幫幫忙，出門人苦惱子，請大家多賞崵一點吧。」那一個載開花帽子的江北婦人，托着一只破木盤，向看客兜錢。可是一般看客，都面面相覷，有的恨不得借士遁逃走，有的一隻手伸到袋裹，半晌伸不出來，經那婦人再三哀求，足足有半個鐘頭，結果還兜不到二三百錢。</p>
<p>一對江北老夫妻，唉！唉！的嘆了幾聲，把破帽　　　　，一裹腦兒丢在破籃裹，垂頭喪氣的提了走去。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十四回</p>
<p>酌酒傳餐狂歡含别涙</p>
<p>挑燈溫夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>他笑道，我剛才和媽商量着，應當和你餞餞行才好。自强笑道：笑話，一家人，餞什麽行？而且我不久就要接你們到遷安去。我早聽說了，我們這枝軍隊，要由喜峰口調回來，在遷安縣駐防。桂枝走近前來，一手扶了桌子角，向他望着，微笑道：這兩句話，你總說過二十遍以上了。自强笑道？：眞的嗎？我倒不覺得。桂枝又走近了一步，靠住了他，向他臉上望道：你想吃什麽呢？包角（讀作餃子）撑麫，烙餡兒餅，我都成，我今天親手作點東西你吃吃，就算餞行啦。趙自强順勢握住了桂枝的手，將他的手在臉上輕輕偎貼着，然後偏了頭望着他道：你心裹不難受嗎？桂枝笑道：你們爲我是小孩子什麽都不懂嗎？我們不久就要見面的蜜月裹頭，應該歡歡喜喜的，心裹難受作什麽？自强道：你們老太太呢？桂枝笑道：我們老太太更比我懂事了，難受什麽？你說，吃包角子呢，還是餡兒餅？他說話時，兩隻手握住自强的兩隻手，搖撼了幾下。自强站起來，用手按住了他的肩膀，然後笑道，只要是你作的，什麽東西都好吃。桂枝將頭偎在他懷裹，伸手撫操着他的臉道：我作羊肉白菜餡兒烙餅你吃，好嗎？自强道：好的，不過太費事了。桂枝道：不，我一定得作餡烙餅你吃。自强道：爲什麽一定要作餡餅我吃呢？桂枝笑道，有道是天上不會掉下餡餅來，大槪餡餅是最好的東西。我今天烙了餡餅給你吃，讓你得個好兆頭。自强哈哈大笑，夫妻倆在屋子裹大大開心一陣。（二四一）</p>

<h3>歲寒清供</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>春日花樹爛漫，冬日沍守，萬樹凋零，經霜楓楠，紅葉點綴風雪中，類似春花吧了。但，尙有幾枝老樹，幾盆寒卉，獨秀孤標，挺寒競艷，可不是寒月美人，雪中艷姬嗎？把伊們藏在　室，供在齋中，眞是寒威凛冽中的良伴咧。</p>
<p>（一）水仙是春日盆景的名葩，丰姿清秀，凌皮脈脈含情。只須種在水缶裹面，伴以瑩潔的小石子，不須齷齪的泥土，污穢的肥料，眞是别種植物所沒有的高潔品格。凌波的洛神，解佩的漢女，降渚的湘娥，都是伊的影子啊。伊是多年生草本，有青翠細長平行脈的葉，地下莖作塊狀的，羣芳譜所說「根似蒜頭」，這根便是地下莖啊。莖頭開花數朶，大如簪頭，植物學上呌做　形花，大槪白色，别有黃色杯狀的副花冠。孫齊之詩道：「消盡冰心粉色微」。可見伊是素媚冷艷了。黃山谷詩道：「含香體素欲傾城，山礬是弟梅是兄」因爲伊開在梅花之後，所以讓梅做哥哥了。從前唐明皇賜他的三姨虢國夫人，紅水仙十二盆，盆是金玉七寳所造。這雖是寵愛虢國夫人，也是寵愛水仙。唐人詩道：「虢國夫人了主恩，平明騎馬入宮門；地嫌脂粉污顏色，澹掃娥眉朝至尊」。原來虢國夫人是一朶水仙啊。</p>
<p>（二）蠟梅原名「黃梅」，本非梅種，因其花放時，與紅梅相近，形狀香氣，又很相同；所以呌估蠟梅。也不是花開於臘月之故，因其花瓣似撚蠟所成：所以呌做「蠟梅」了。蠟梅以香勝，黃山谷詩道：「體熏山臍臍，色染　薇露」。韓子蒼詩道：「路入君家百步香，隔廉初試漢宮妝，只疑夢到昭陽殿，一簇輕紅簇澹黃」。羣芳譜說：「蠟梅的香，只可遠聞，不可近嗅」。原來它的香氣太濃，翻而有害腦經的緣故。把蠟梅插在膽缾，供諸案頭，蠟丸輕綴，梅香馥郁，眞是歲寒的佳品呢。</p>
<p>（三）南天燭是常緑灌木，園庭中多植之。莖光滑秀媚；葉是羽狀複葉；花軸生在幹的上部。夏開小花，五瓣色白，實圖葵生，到了秋冬，變作紅色，顆顆如珠，十分美麗。把南天燭植在盆中或膽缾，來點綴小齋的陳設，不是很雅緻嗎？</p>
<p>（四）梅花梅開百花之先，是新春首放的花，人們欣賞它的「色」「香」！所以自來膾炙人口。林和靖把它當作妻，也可見林處士的愛好了。「疎影橫斜水清淺，暗香浮動月黃昏。」也是林處士的名句。杜工部詩道：「巡簷索共梅花笑，冷蕊疎枝半不禁。」梅花除紅白以外，又有「蕚緑華」的一種，見於「石湖梅譜，」說梅花純緑的，呌做「蕚緑華。」其實，白的梅花，開時微帶緑色，所以呌做「緑蕚梅。」古人以橫斜，疏瘦，老枝，怪奇爲貴，現在盆景梅花，蟠曲疏斜，雖具丰姿，非出天然，也不能稱爲貴品。宋書說：「武帝女壽陽公主，臥含章殿簷下。梅花落在公主額上，成了五出花瓣，拂之不去，皇后留之。自後遂有「梅花妝。」這段故事，非常風韻，我們也毌須管它神話不神話了。還有一個神話，也非常香艷。龍城錄載「隋開皇中，趙師雄遊羅浮。日暮，於林間酒肆旁舍，見美人澹妝素服出迎。師雄與語，言極清麗，芳香襲人；與之叩酒家共飲，一緑衣童子歌舞於側。師雄醉臥，久之，東方旣白。起視，用在大梅花樹下，上有翠羽啾嘈，月落參橫，但惆悵而已！」觀這段神話，趟師雄似乎不及孤干處士遠甚，「解語花」難道朶朶勝人嗎？</p>

<h3>主婦與辦年貨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>打不破的習慣，一年一度的舊歷年關，又在眼前了。這舊歷新年，雖沒有什麽可說的價値，可是於國貨的推銷，却有很深切的關係，尤其是這種責任，都在一家的主婦手裹。</p>
<p>最近社會上最忙的，除了一般做買賣的商店以外，要算家庭中的主婦了。如果有工夫的話，請大家留心馬路上的店舗，顧客中間，十分之七八，都是來辦年貨的太太奶奶，間或有些僕人們來光顧，也是奉了太太奶奶之命而來的。她們爲什麽來光顧？便是辦年貨，年貨是一個籠統名詞，分析起來，約有四種：</p>
<p>（一）是預備過年自用的。什麽謝年，什麽過節，什麽祭祖，什麽掛像。</p>
<p>（二）是新年中娛樂用的。給小兒穿的喫的，供小兒玩耍的，以及家人自己們消遣的。</p>
<p>（三）是送禮用的，要好的親戚朋友，彼此饋贈，似乎是禮尙往來，未能免俗的。</p>
<p>（四）趁這新年，把舊的物件棄掉，來買此新的用品，表示與年更始的。這四種中，包括喫的，穿的，住的，以及一切用的，玩的，都在裹頭。於是乎做主婦的，便大忙特忙了。可是我要在一般主婦們辦年貨前，不客氣的說幾句話，你們旣已知道今年是婦妇國貨年，那麽採辦年貨時候，千萬要注意你所買的年貨，是不是國貨？有沒有來自外洋的東西？我要勸你們仔細的留意，嚴格的選擇，你們須知：</p>
<p>（一）買外國貨來自己應用，是最不體面的事情。</p>
<p>（二）買外國貨來給兒童食用，是最不正當的敎訓。</p>
<p>（三）買外國貨來送戚友，是看不起戚友，蔑視戚友的人格。</p>
<p>（四）買外國貨來裝飾點綴，是自形其醜，難免受親友的鄙棄。</p>
<p>（五）買外國貨來請客，是輕視客人，降低客人身分，（用洋烟洋酒請客，是最沒志氣的事。）</p>
<p>我願賢明的主婦們．以及鍾愛主婦的先生們，在這辦年貨時候，大家只要用一些工夫，立一個志願，多多的光顧到國貨工廠國貨公司抱定非國貨不買的心理，來規勸其夫，夫勉其婦的做去，中國國貨纔有出頭的日子，外國貨纔有絶跡的希望。我再不願看到下面兩段不名譽不吉利的新聞：</p>
<p>（一）國際貿易局報告：去年上海化裝品進口數量，逹一百四十萬元。</p>
<p>（二）國際貿易局報告，去年洋烟洋酒進口數量，總値一千餘萬金元，滬埠消耗佔三分之一　。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年中之仇貨傾銷問題</h3>
<p>— 黃玄萬</p>
<p>從歷史的過去，我們可以檢察和覆按，關於這「仇貨傾銷」問題，早已成爲我們近代史上最沉痛的一頁，並且，他的嚴重性，是只有日益擴大和深刻化，沒有解决的生機，雖然在中間，也仍有過一度小小的變化，因爲「九一八」「一二八」的國難，而促起我們抵貨運動的蓬勃，得以稍稍斂迹過，可是狡猾的日本人，它是不肯甘心的，放着這一塊肥肉，而不去牢割，單單垂涎是不中用的，所以，他會「處心積慮」，他會「死灰復燃」，他是一面「勾結奸商，肆行傾銷」，一面「改頭換面，欺哄國人」，於是結果，到底又是我們失敗了，龐大的數字，據海關報告，去年仇貨輸入總數，在二萬萬元以上，而在他威脅下的東四省，還不在内，可惡的仇人，露出了猙獰的微笑，但是，再轉顧我們的國貨界，熱烈的希望，却反被痛心的事實所粉碎了，不過，從今年起－婦女國貨年的伊始，這是大衆一致所同聲承認的，它是我們國貨界最嚴重的轉變期，我們所望於他者，至大且鉅，可是，開門的第一聲在「婦女國貨年」的聲浪眞充滿國内的時候，這「仇貨傾銷」的餘音，却又隔着而起，報頭上顯着的標題，「華北仇貨傾銷益烈」，他們且以有組織，有計劃的策略，實肆大規模的傾銷，而同時全國各地，仇貨亦日益踴躍，眞大有「山雨欲來風滿樓」之槪，尤可笑者，最近日本廣田外相，在他的對外宣言裹，竟有對華恊調的表示，無疑的，這又是他狡猾的手段，乘時傾銷的先聲，而「司馬昭之心，路人皆知」，這是不足爲奇的。</p>
<p>那末，我們在這一幅慘淡的木炭畫中，能不深深地起了感觸，覺得這種痛心事實的演出，實爲我老大民衆的太不爭氣，而國貨界的前途，也尤是荆棘叢生，暗礁環伏，這種嚴重的局勢，正待我們去打開和應付，以愚之見，治標之計，宜速注意下列二項之實行：</p>
<p>一，專員調查，實地宣傳國貨廠商急應特派專員，赴各地詳細調查仇貨傾銷眞相，並實地宣傳，以冀民衆醒悟，而使國貨有擴展之趨勢。</p>
<p>二，速征傾銷稅帝國主義者，本以我國低輕關稅，爲傾銷之初步之便利，然則値此時機，我當局急宜嚴征傾銷稅，以示抵制，而予國貨以保障。</p>
<p>至於根本問題，自然只要全國民衆的一致總動員「視仇貨如洪水　猛獸，而堅行拒絶」，這樣，那麽仇貨的猖獗，我想終有一天會被國貨的呼聲，所遁聲滅跡。</p>
<h3>眞正的摩登婦女</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>摩登婦女，這是一個多麽好聽的名詞，凡屬女子，誰不想做摩登婦女，誰不願做摩登女子，大家都以做摩登婦女爲榮，都以被人稱摩登女爲無上之光輝，摩登婦女呀！你眞是一個使人羡慕的名詞！</p>
<p>什麽呌做摩登婦女？怎樣才能配稱爲摩登婦女？照一般的人說來，摩登婦女者，必身穿洋貨，脚着洋襪洋鞋，頭髮作洋化式，一切的一切，都要服用外貨，這樣的婦女，才是摩登婦女，其實，這種舉動，這種觀念，眞是大錯而特錯了，在這婦女國貨年裹頭，我們非起來加以糾正不可。</p>
<p>年來我們中國，國勢的衰弱，社會經濟的不景氣，是一件誰都不能否認之事實，其所以致此之原因，固然很多，但帝國主義者之經濟侵略，實爲最主要的原因之一，據去年國際貿易局報告，全年入超約爲九萬萬元，啊約！此「九萬萬元」四字，是一個何等使人驚駭的數目字呀！我們每人平均起來，僅僅去年一年，要貢獻給外國人二大元，讀者試閉目一思，能不痛心？豈可以漠然視之乎？在此九萬萬元入超中，我們可以大胆的說一句，婦女們要占十分之六七的責任，所以，今年之公定爲婦女國貨年，是有很深切的悲痛的意義的！</p>
<p>婦女們，起來吧：在這婦女國貨年裹頭，要努力的糾正過去一切的錯誤，尤其是崇拜外貨，服用外國貨就是摩登婦女的心理，根本要剷除一下，在這一年之中，能實行下列各條約的，才是眞正的摩登婦女。</p>
<p>（一）不說外貨好，（二）不買外國貨，（三）服用國貨和土貨，（四）帮助國貨的生產事業。</p>

<p>記者昨經小西門蓬萊路，見蓬萊巿場北部中華琺瑯廠北首橱窗前，圍而觀者數十人，深以爲奇，亦排衆入内，見該橱窗内新布置一二八紀念廣告，用意深遠，足徵該廠經理方劍閣君之見識高人一等，無怪渠之梓鄕人士（南翔）咸替其取一綽號曰「鐵算盤」矣。（言其無論何事，經其一算，自無錯誤，佩其精明强幹之意，）爰將所見，介紹如下，以供參考，諒亦關心國事與提倡國貨之諸同志所願聞也。壁上貼有一尺闊二尺長之白地黑邊標語五張，一曰「紀念一二八要决心服用國貨」，二曰「外國貨物何所好，金錢換去造鎗砲」三曰「提倡國貨，是全國民衆的責任」四曰「立鶴牌面盆，是最完美的國貨」，五曰「請用國貨，以表愛國熱忱」角上有繪紅心二，鮮血由心下滴者，有畫武裝兵士持鎗作前進狀者，語簡意明，甚爲觸目，下以木板塗紅漆，作洋房牆壁狀，已殘缺不全，牆内尙有火燒木頭數根，以及燒燬之零星雜物，一兵持鎗，循牆壁而向前進，兩目閃閃，注意前方，牆畔有一高射砲，以該廠所出之飯盂蓋等作架，用兩熱水瓶接連爲砲身，後有一兵，跪於砲架之旁作瞄凖狀，前有中華坦克車一輛．約長三尺，以飯盂作頂，茶盎作燈，頂碗籃蓋作輪，上懸小旗，維妙維肖，空中懸有日飛機一，中央以痰盂疊成堡壘，壘外中日兵士正在肉搏，血流如注，驟視之，完全一幅閘北慘狀圖，觀衆莫不深恨敵人之凶暴，而歎我國當局徒唱收復失地口號，對於被蹂躪之地，依舊斷垣殘壁，而任其荒凉，希望從速實踐精神團結四字以努力對外也。</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年開篇</h3>
<p>— 褚劍屏</p>
<p>嗟我中華勢已阽，亡國之慘在眼前：轉弱爲强無他法，提倡國貨有效騐·（常言道）國家興亡匹夫責，和衷共濟（要）團結堅·本巿商會見及此，苦口婆心不自懈，規定了（這）婦女國貨年·從此奉勸女同胞，服用國貨要爭先，（因爲）外貨雖覺外表美，繡花枕被譏有何顏？（况）近年國貨多進步，樸實耐用價又廉·服用國貨挽利權，何異抗敵奏凱旋？（若能）親友之間常勸導，塞漏巵其功尤難掩！賢妻良母模範，家庭和樂實堪羡，（而且）種瓜得瓜子女賢，旣省金錢又愛國，何樂不爲何用言·亡羊補牢尙未晚，揚眉吐氣指顧間，挽狂瀾全仗女青年·</p>
<h3>上下古今</h3>
<p>— 洽成</p>
<p>（一）前言</p>
<p>提倡國貨不在多說，惟在力行而已！有人說是標語年，有人說是口號年，我們且不必對人生意氣之爭，事综勝於雄辯，實在的成績，又有誰敢否認。夫人小姐，你說對麽？</p>
<p>（二）復興民族精神</p>
<p>因爲外患頻仍，客觀的環境使我們確定需要復興我們的民族精神，但是，民族的自信是絶對的需要的，我們雖不必有妄自尊大的思想，最低限度須下迷信他人。</p>
<p>（三）請君作如是觀</p>
<p>有人誤會服用國貨就不摩登，其實摩登祗是大家的一種觀念而已！如果你以爲這是摩登，他以爲這也是摩登，好在并沒有什麽成文法，衆望所歸，還不成功了麽？</p>
<p>（四）國貨視同子女</p>
<p>兒子是自己的好，無分男女，同具此感。葛成慧女博士幽默的說純粹國貨祗有一些小寳貝：但願太太們都以國貨視同子女，在這許多保姆監護之下，獲得大好的發展。</p>
<p>（五）但求無愧我心</p>
<p>仲尼論孝，說盡心而已矣！在這婦女國貨年，太太奶奶們也許覺得厥職匪輕，難免愴惶之處，其實唯一的道理，祗要人人無愧我心，有幾分力便　盡幾分，便　已功德無量了。</p>

<h3>擊彈表演第二日</h3>
<p>史密斯更神化</p>
<p>創六七零點上海新紀錄</p>
<p>今晚劉富英康博斯出塲</p>
<p>福克尼造成之上海職業擊彈家最高紀錄、六百二十一點、昨晚被威午利史密斯以六百七十點打破之、此世界職業擊彈名家史密斯昨前四次表演、已使上海中西仕女之嗜好於斯道者、感覺無上欣慰、尤其一般業餘家、更因此獲得不少妙法、上海擊彈界之受惠史密斯、可謂巨矣、今日仍有兩塲表演、對方乃中葡業餘名家劉富宗及康卜斯、地點及時間照舊、</p>
<p>史密斯（右）李公頴（左）合影（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>上海紀錄史密斯昨日第二日之兩塲表演、較第一日尤佳、第一塲共十槍、得九百二十二點、平均第槍九十二點二、似非觀衆意想所及、而第二塲共五槍、得一千零九點、平均每槍二百零一强、直使觀衆驚奇不止、上海職業新紀錄之產生、亦在此最後第四槍、前後十五槍、惟第十五槍空槍、意者末一槍如不欲多事耳、昨日最高點額六七○．其次五二七．二四一．二二八．八八．五四．</p>
<p>公頴大佳我國彈王李公頴能與聞名世界之職業家對抗、依然顯其一身懷抱、毫無不安狀態、良可嘉許、昨日共擊十一槍、雖無產生巨大點額、但共有二百二十八點、平均二十點强、爲其本人最高紀錄、尤覺難能可貴、</p>
<p>世璋可兒徐世璋爲我國新進有造之青年、曾代表中華出席去年中英國際擊彈錦標之第五位大將、昨晚寥寥數槍、打來頗有路逕、幾次絶處逢主、識者亦爲之讚賞、其最大之點額二十四、共計六槍得五十六點、</p>
<p>富宗出塲劉富宗今日下午六時被選出塲對抗、劉氏亦爲去年中英國際賽中之五大將之一、晚九時一刻、則爲葡人好手康卜斯、同時史密斯之表演、愈打愈精、今日似可預期產生較高之紀錄、一新上擊海彈界之耳目、</p>

<h3>交大大津臨别戰</h3>
<p>敗於中華聨隊</p>
<p>－一比二－</p>
<p>▲兩次越位致失良機</p>
<p>（天津五日通訊）上海交大足球隊、月初來津戰和北寗後、昨午再於南開塲會師中華隊、是日寒氣龔人、觀衆仍逹千餘人、雪後塲地、掃除一新、惟因結凍、地面遍露裂痕、是役交鋒前、兩軍整隊出馬、稍試脚頭、交大隊雖一二隊員仍未出塲、實力已較戰北寗時加强、中華隊因隊長孫思敬臨時缺席、全隊隊員大有望穿秋水之槪、幸副隊長張長裕先時蒞塲、士氣尙未銳减、是役遂改由趙啓春任中堅、</p>
<p>津隊猛攻時届三時、裁判員王子華笛聲遂發、兩軍脚下對峙、開始躍動、交大隊前軍聨絡頗佳、惟中華後防堅實、數被挫退、未幾中華大舉進攻、孫福來球勢極猛、攻門偏被拍出、孫永泉趕上力蹴、砰聲起處、球越門過矣、</p>
<p>先開紀錄交大門將范家駒、以發球機會、前遞李北良、薛文繡射門又成泡影、中華瞬間又得勢、張髭裕帶球前驅、交大境内、遂成衆矢之的、萬軍雜踏下、姜璐巧獲來球、順勢一脚、球急衝網角、遂開紀錄、</p>
<p>平分秋色中華得此球後、聲威益振、屢以短距離之傳遞侵入敵營、交大防軍不懈職守、王陳連却敵軍、轉戰間、中華誤犯手球、李北良主踼、脚起處、直傳邊陲、周光中知機再踼、球遂平趨入網、陳爾德返身圖救、爲時已遲、再戰良久、上半塲遂成一比一之平局、</p>
<p>越位可惜後半時雙方易將應戰、陣綫變更、開球後、中華再失機會、趙啓春前後呼應、得力不小、梁銘宗監視萬象華、寸步不移、累煞小將、交大隊全塲奔馳、乘機而動、溫聨東越敵直上、攻門勢急、金阿督仆地拘球、門前再告平安、萬象華瞬間、又以極佳機會、攻門中的、惜恭文繡進取心切、遂被罰越位、</p>
<p>交大敗北中華隊孫永泉主踼、落點極佳、姜璐趕上盤進、又被包圍、五分鐘後、交大龔以斌截得王鴻榮射來之球、急起脚叩關、又奏功、不幸再因越位失效、最後一分鐘、中華興師齊進、孫永泉接得張長裕傳來之球、．順勢射門、偏觸門項、撞落門前、姜璐趕上猛蹴、以極佳姿勢、再博采聲、瞬間局終、交大乃以一比二失利、是役罷戰、交大領隊彭文餘君對記者談、該隊全體已於昨夜十時、啓程返滬、因該隊北來稍遲、且校方將於五日開課、故須趕回、至各地友隊之約、勢難成行、異日如遇機會、再當領敎、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>世家子弟</h3>
<p>— 黃家裔</p>
<p>考世家不外三種：一是父祖讀了書，做了大官，便稱世家。子弟走出來文縐縐的，　、但身分極高，時常來一個「一扭」，或說聲「不的」，便掃蕩無餘。二是軍功世家、古人雖「恥以軍功取位」或講究「軍容不入於國」，然那種聲勢在民間是極大的，子弟做夢也希望帶兵打仗，可怕極了，他隨時可以抓人去打板子。三是經商起家而也號世家的，遭社會人士看不起，然自以爲操縱着社會的命脈，子弟便覺什麽皆可買來，他只問問價錢，拿錢去換。</p>
<p>近來打板子之風少了。風流公子大率穿西裝，「閨秀」也要「摩登」，走出街上來了。因爲中國若干年來已經是「累破勃裂苦」，要有平等和自由的。</p>
<p>將這世家微微撥開一看，裹面不外兩種東西，一者野蠻（Barbarism），二者奴才主義Ｓ（lavery），此外便是些虚張聲勢，和好看的招牌。</p>
<p>這兩種精神一貫，互相爲用。主子是奴才，因爲他上面有皇帝，和主子，他下面更有奴才和「奴才的奴才」。一貫政策便是打拱作揖，阿諛諂媚，曲意逢迎，便成就了不可救藥的腐敗和放縱的蠻野。</p>
<p>這麽一種烏烟瘴氣，便將「世家」籠住，「濃化得不得開」。這里面的孩子，卽算原來節聰明，大率因爲包圍之故，變成俗子，或白痴，或紈袴，便偶爾因爲家長賢明，也能造成學問，通逹人情，但那便是二者这外更加上大架子和金粉招牌，無非要使非世家的平民，變成更苦的奴隸。</p>
<p>中國目前大等級的分化尙示顯明，然試想一個平民走入一個王府裹去，正如年輕的外交家第一次踏入國際聨盟會場，也許要感到手足無措的。這便是等級分别的好例子。比「世家」更高貴的有「帝王家」，但有時也有「願世世無生帝王家」之歎。奴隸們反抗起來後，則平日之可喜，大抵要成爲可悲。以新力抵抗腐敗，以文明消納野蠻，其勝敗是在東西洋史上有着前例的。</p>
<p>此後新興的官僚，軍閥，豪商「世家」總要有些起來，那班子弟的態度也許更不同些吧！</p>
<h3>論「說謊」</h3>
<p>— 藴剛</p>
<p>早些日子在「自由談」上看見郁逹夫先生提到娃爾德的『說謊的衰落』（Thedecay　of　Lying），那書裹邊攻擊寫實主義，追懷古昔的美的虚幻世界；并且說到美國人不會有文學的創製，就因爲華盛頓用斫櫻檻桃樹的一個傳說，是窒塞殺美國人的創造本能的一種毒素。</p>
<p>娃爾德雖然是被稱爲唯美派的文學家而有這種見解，但事實上我以爲文學的最高境界，確要算是「說謊」了。照像藝術之不及寫生畫的高超，這是古今來一致承認的事實。上帝的技巧雖怎樣美妙，究竟也有不少呆笨的產品，所以有人說藝術家的技巧與創造力，在有些時勝過於上帝的。我卽不如此說，然而，我以爲藝術家的補充上帝創造之不及的技巧者。曹雪芹著紅樓夢說是『一片荒唐言，滿紙酸辛涙』，曹氏是自認爲說謊的，但借此說謊而流出他的傷心的蘊蓄，這是主觀方面說謊之成功；而紅樓夢竟因此獲得極廣大讀者的稱仰，不必說，在客觀方面說謊成功之偉大，也是無可置疑的。卽單以其『初闢鴻濛』那段石呀，草呀的楔子，也就够美了！但是誰也不相信其不是說謊。</p>
<p>西洋的聖經中的創世記，眞茺唐得可以，但在文學中竟成爲很有力的一部，不信上帝的創造世界是那末的隨便，但亞當夏娃在文學作品中不竟常常的露臉嗎？中國也有同樣美的傳說，女媧不僅能練石補天，也能揑土造人，可惜中國的文學家，除了少數如屈原不很『認眞』外，都不甚樂於說謊，此又中國文學史上的領域不甚光昌的緣故了。</p>
<p>但在民間的傳說，中國還是有不少的美的說謊，如白蛇娘娘的故事，如梁山泊祝英台的化鳥，如哭長城的孟姜女，也還很可以襢充中國文學作品之窄狹。在北平－卽古之北京也，陶然亭畔有沉埋荒草間的香塚鸚鵡塚等，傳說有好幾種，憑吊的人，反正是不間斷的在那里徘徊的，不甚有意趣的陶然亭，有這樣一兩個土堆倒也生出了多少興味；偏有人要考證這香塚並非香妃塚，也並非林黛玉葬花處；但是是甚麽呢？眞是「論語社」先生們說的：『糖糕遇着認眞人』－人誰不知林黛玉根本是「荒唐言」裹邊的人物？</p>
<p>日本已死的文學家德富蘆花著一部出色的不如歸，把浪子的身世及所到的地方說得活靈活現的，於是好事者卽在豆子海濱大樹邊建一座廟宇，有不少文人及青年男女在那兒憑吊留下詩句，并且還有了如照片之類的畫片，我也訪問過了，彷彿很像皆有其事似的。實際上是蘆花的說謊，至少，有大半是謊言，這說謊的成功，不也有些如上帝玩弄世人有相近似的效力麽？我是早知蘆花是說謊的，然而，我之去，也就是證明我是很有意於接受其謊言的，而且正以其說謊之爲美！</p>
<p>西洋文學作品之偉大，正因其說謊能力之富厚，也可以說屈原文學作品之崇閎，而是得力其不惜盡量說謊；娃爾德慨歎於『說謊之衰落』，確非其專在詆毁寫實主義家；因爲一定要指定照像藝術是藝術，而寫生盡意境畫都不是藝術，藝術的國土確是在作耗子之鑽牛角的把戲了。</p>
<p>文學之要置重於想像，卽在提倡說謊；想像需要素養，說謊自然更需要素養；否則說謊而至於張天師之在大世界掛出畫符的價目，以價目之高低而定驅鬼之功效，則封神演義會被推稱爲世界之第一部文學名著，而捉鬼傳不必說也是占有其最高之地位的了。</p>
<p>中國文學家最缺乏說謊，其所以然，是由於缺乏說謊的素養的緣故。</p>
<h3>歸途</h3>
<p>— 董每戡</p>
<p>澄潔肥圓的月兒懸在薄暗的中天，這是廢歷十月十五的夜。寒風像針一樣地侵蝕着路上行人們的肌膚，路燈疲乏得要瞌睡了。「上船去」！是的，我要與這久居的上海暫别了。</p>
<p>别，想到牠就多少會有點兒黯然的感覺，何况，何况又親自嘗到這不得不黯然的滋味？雖說是暫時而且短短的别。</p>
<p>悄悄地踱上了拖人别離的船，這轆轆的輪聲是多麽搖蕩人的心啊！怎樣禁得住呢？我這脆弱的心，牠忐忑着，不自主地忐忑起來了！</p>
<p>中夜，圓月踱上天頂了，孤獨的寂寥和别離的愁思泛上了我的心頭，我只啞然地倚着船欄，凝視那深黑以而顫動着的海水；瀉遍了海面的月光，竟會是那麽淡　　得簡直有點兒使人起空漢之感！我的心也隨着顫動的海波在顫動。</p>
<p>「索性快些離開了上海罷」－我這樣想；然而，船還依然懶懶地躺在浮橋的身邊，雖然牠在呻吟着。終於我有些不耐煩了，向茶房詢明開駛的時間，眞討厭！据說還足足要三句鐘呢。</p>
<p>人的心情，别離的心情，總是這般異樣，旣覺到空虚，而又感到悶塞！時間的步武此刻好像挨得特别慢，還未到開船的時刻，同艙的那幾位似曾相識而尙未交一語的客人，都已睡着，而且都睡得深沉了，他們的鼾聲驕傲地譏笑着輾轉未寐的我，不禁油然而生嫉妒之心，嫉妒他們都享受到酣睡的舒適！</p>
<p>自然，我也想設法來消遣這鬰悶的時光；可是有什麽方法呢？終於只有勉强地拿起戴納氏著的莎士比亞一書來從頭重讀，讀着，讀着，也許是因爲近來對於莎士比亞有着特殊興趣之故，並又是第二次讀這一册書，因而很容易地勾引出興味來。</p>
<p>一面一頁一頁地看下去，一面憧憬着莎氏的偉大，我一時忘記夜已深沉，忘了精神因少睡而起倦怠，忘了輪船早已轉動，航行在半句鐘前就已開始了。</p>
<p>月色較前更顯得清淡，她已踱過天頂了。輪聲轆轆的響着，那是頗有節奏的；海風撼着窗檽，單薄的棉被抵不住寒氣的襲擊，雖不可說是「寒衾如鐵，」暖意總可說是已消散凈盡了。</p>
<p>幻想着將晤面的故鄕和故家，又懷念着剛别了的上海和在上海的人！頃刻之間，莎士比亞的影子又糢糊了，只剩得嘴巴中還無意識地哼着的莎翁憧憬於愛人的香和影的句子：</p>
<p>「我若不驚異百合的白；</p>
<p>就也不感覺薔薇的紅！</p>
<h3>說謊的丈夫（續）</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>這樣，一連在圖書館裹消磨了將近一個月的時間，年青丈夫計算着往常發薪的時期已快到了，於是他便跑到幾個熟識的朋友那裹去，愁眉苦臉的向他們借錢。錢幸而順利地借到了手，但他還有些不放心，他鄭重叮囑着每一個朋友，說這借欵是秘密的，只要他一有錢，就親自來歸還，請他們無論怎樣不要到他家裹去索討。</p>
<p>把借來的錢當做薪水呈獻到愛妻的面前，讓她去支配生活的費用，年青丈夫的心頭感到一種比黃連還要苦的苦味。但爲要使他的妻快樂，他心裹雖然痛苦，也只得勉强裝着幸福的神情，繼續開留聲機，繼續和她談笑。</p>
<p>然而錢的力量到底是比什麽都要大，幾個借錢給他的朋友，見他始終不來歸還，縱使受了他鄭重的叮囑，爲了自身的需要起見，也不得不到他家裹去索討了。</p>
<p>有一天，年青丈夫剛從圖書館裹消磨了一天光陰回家來，走到了自己門前，忽然聽得屋裹有爭吵的聲音。這聲音，他很快的便辨出了一個是他的妻，一個是曾經借過錢的朋友。</p>
<p>「怎麽會有這種事；他每月都有薪水拿，何必向你借錢？」</p>
<p>「明明是他問我借的，不信你可以問他。你想賴債可不成！哼！」</p>
<p>年青丈夫本能地把身子一縮，躡手躡脚的離開了家門，在馬路上無目的地四處亂蕩。一直到天黑了下來，店舗裹的電燈都放了光，估量着那討債的朋友一定已經走了，他纔拖着他疲乏的身子回家來。</p>
<p>一進門，他便瞧見了，青的妻那在他意料中的憤怒的紅臉。她氣憤的向他問：</p>
<p>「你借了人家的錢嗎？」</p>
<p>這問話宛似一根針，刺進了年青丈夫的心，使他的心劇烈地痛楚起來，他幾乎忍不住要哭了。但他却微笑着說：</p>
<p>「親愛的，不錯，那是有的。不過這是一些小借欵，我馬上就可以𢬌還他。」（完）</p>
<h3>我詛咒你那麽一笑</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>如今一想起那麽一付笑容，我還要狠狠地說一聲，我詛咒你！</p>
<p>事情的發生，原是有好幾年了。但印象太深，總使人不易忘去，雖然我是極願意在心裹埋葬了這麽一件不愉快的事情。</p>
<p>那時候，我正在野人山中的一家客店裹，做一名不三不四的夥計，過着半天苦工半天敎書的日子。</p>
<p>每天日頭落山的時候，總有好些駝貨的馬隊，從山峯上面，帶着黃错，走了下來，在谷裹的店家過夜。另外，隔不兩三天，還有千崖壩（雲南人呌做夷方壩）的擺夷婦女，尤其多的是農家少女，挑着本鄕的產物：像鷄呀，鴨呀，鵝呀，蛋呀，果物呀，以及一些不知名的，夷地才出產的東西，經過這兒，也來在山家店裹，息宿一晚，才走到缅甸北部的大商埠，八募去；換了些洋線，洋布，洋針，洋油，洋火之類回來，再行經過這兒，住下去，等待次日的晨光，才又同着朝霞一道兒去了。</p>
<p>她們成羣結隊地，走在三四天少有人烟的，全是原始森林的野人山中，當然也滲雜些男子，但男子比起女的來，總是爲數寥寥的。一隊差不多有二三十個人，每人的肩上都挑有兩個裝滿雜貨的竹筐子。那樣兒，看起來，全不像漢人挑東西的辦法：竹筐子上拴着四股索子，索子繫在扁担的兩端。他們的呢，却不要什麽索子，只把扁担的兩端，插進竹筐子裹面，便挑起走了。像這樣挑着担子的隊伍白天緩緩地走在羣山裹面，一路說着笑，一路唱着歌，勞倦和辛苦，便都給年青的銳氣征服着了。</p>
<p>正午，就把重鈿鈿的担子，放在坡邊的樹下，取出竹筐子内的銻鍋，裝些菜和米，走到不遠的澗邊，淘洗乾凈，拿回來放在三塊石頭支成的灶上。同時，另一個女伴，已在路旁的林中，檢得一抱枯乾的枝條和落葉，笑盈盈地走來燃火。</p>
<p>飯後又重新登上熟識的旅途。同着蒼茫的暮色，一齊走進山村的茅店，鎭日的勞苦，便和肩上的担子，一同卸脫了。她們走進店子的時候，彷彿回到自己的家一樣，也不通知主人，也不做出客氣的招呼，只是笑聲，話聲，和着人影，一夥兒湧了進來，就急急忙忙，爭先佔據着好的房間，好的舗位。然後，趕到廚房去，搶着水瓢，爭取清凉的水，一個個仰起脖子，咕咕地喝着，笑着。</p>
<p>我們的山谷，整天都是靜悄悄的，非常的清冷。尤其在正午之後，大家都要躺息一會兒，店門外也少有人行走了，這時就更見寂寞，竟連四周的羣山，都彷彿沉入了遠古的夢中。但當她們一從山上走了下來，山谷裹的茅草店子，就裹裹外外通換上了一種熱閙的而又是歡愉的空氣。</p>
<p>這一隊漂泊的夷家女子，喝好水，息足氣，便各自拿着一條潔白的汗巾，到溪邊去洗澡去了。直到夜色埋着整個山谷，家家茅屋透出點點燈光時，才一面低聲唱着，一央絞着水濕的頭髮，帶着凉爽的夜氣回來。登時店家的院落裹，點綴起了堆堆煮飯的野火，同時瀰漫阒憂鬰的，而也是快樂的歌聲。火光閃現着，她們微紅發光的面龐，晚風吹拂着，她們滴落水珠的長髮，眞像一羣魔女似的突然在夜間出現了，也可說是江中的水妖，林間的精怪，到來了吧。</p>
<p>對於這些夷家少女的樣子，似乎沒有誇寫的必要，不過我要略爲說一點，就是走過好些地方，看過好些民族了，但要像擺夷婦女那樣的清秀，確是很少有的。第一稍稍使我感到詫異的，是她們生息的家鄕——怒江流域，檳榔江流域（又名橄欖江及太平江）全是些烟瘴毒烈漢人不敢長住的地方，怎麽會長出這麽佳麗的花呢？大約在昆明吧，同時也在滇西的旅途中，�聽到這麼相似的設備話：</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>多空堅持甚力</p>
<p>公債絶少新買賣</p>
<p>－巿價漲跌參差不一－</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、巿面仍趨混沌、巿上除掉期略有進出外、其餘新買賣絶少成交、多空雙方、堅持甚力、多數預備留待陰歷新年紅盤、以觀究竟、巿上卽有掉期、亦係零星户頭居多、致言目下趨勢、陰歷年内恐不致有甚上落、交易祇餘今明兩天、巿塲人心、大都紅盤看好、并有看鹽稅或將發現五十三元以上新高價、此雖妄言妄聽、但時局如安定如恒者、或有希望、并非完全囈語也、此種預測、一則根據環境之安穩、一則根據空方之繼續放出、故亦不爲無因也、昨日經過、異常平穩、趨勢因混沌而和於盤旋、上午兩盤、前漲後跌、爲數祗一二角、午後開盤、微小一角至三角、而鹽稅起又轉微漲、收盤形勢、大都近期平平、遠期略堅、鹽稅以後、稍見疲軟、巿價結果、計漲跌互見、多數爲一二角、金長跌四角爲最鉅、成交總數、計共八百六十七萬一千元、内現貨一千元、期貨統鹽稅共二百二十四萬五千、裁兵佔一百四十七萬元、一九關善共七十七萬元、廿捲廿關共一百十四萬五千元、金短正六共一百二十四萬五千、餘則數萬至五十餘萬不等、</p>
<h3>紐約公用股一致上騰</h3>
<p>新豐洋行六日報告云、紐約股巿、先尙平靜、多頭雖有獲利了結、但巿况尙堅、旋因商業消息良好、包括紐約電話公司之用户增加、美國電話電報因而有力、收盤前一句鐘内交易頓轉暢旺、美南電氣尤見活潑、大宗交易自一千股至九萬股者數見不鮮、公用股遂一致上騰、銀鑛股及金屬股皆因投機者預將有順利之白銀立法而漲、債券參差略高、零售業與娛樂業之債券則飛漲極厲、全日成交四百三十三萬股、「小麥」消息利於多方、西南仍旱、下跌時可買進、「棉花」現貨之供給愈少、係利多方、又據謠傳農民對二種减少棉田計劃多有良好回響、惟棉價須不飛漲太速耳、形勢仍佳、茲將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>大廠力進下</p>
<p>棉紗漲四元七</p>
<p>久疲不振之紗巿、今日突然暴漲四元外、此種漲風、久未實現、去年雖有統制會維持、結果未能趨穩、今據巿塲上傳聞、申新廠鑒於花價日高、紗巿不漲、廠方困難、於此在標凖巿塲收進數千包、同時對於倉庫中之採花龍船等紗、亦有出價買回之風說、由此人心激動、一般投機者追隨而進、遂發現劇烈之漲風也、</p>
<p>（人標步步高陞）人標前巿開盤、以美棉步漲、巿勢堅挺、散空抵補、各月漲一元至一元五角、午後聞前巿某廠購買、有維持之說、同時買氣大濃、各月狂漲二元八角至三元六角、全日成交統計三萬九千包　、查賣出吉豐一千八百五十包、同孚二千二百五十包、源大一千九百包、振大一千五百包、愼記一千二百五十包、益昶二千一百五十包、永昌一千八百五十包、買進穗隆五千五百包、恒益一千二百包、長豐二千二百五十包、同和一千包、信　誠四千九百包、福大九百包、元德七百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花漲勢劇烈</h3>
<p>棉巿漲風愈烈、以美棉步漲、而匯兌不動、以致採算價日高、引起投機者活動、同時棉紗亦漲、人心愈昂、兼以美棉减種運動進行仍烈、美棉前途、未免繼續觀好、所以買氣極熾、惟源大號依然抛賣、就大勢而論、暫難趨落、</p>
<p>（鄭標漲逹八九角）鄭標前午開盤、以美棉步漲、而金巿不小、買風仍濃、各月漲三．四角、午後以紗巿上漲、散空抵補、漲勢愈激、各月又漲三．四角、全日成交統計十三萬六千三百擔、查賣出源大一萬四千五百擔、吉豐九千五百擔、同孚二千二百擔、益昶五千八百擔、永昌一千九百擔、振大二千七百擔、恒德二千四百擔、益豐一千七百擔、買進穗隆六千擔、賡豐八千五百擔、愼昌五千五百擔、裕大四千擔、愼記三千三百擔、仁豐一千九百擔、長豐二千三百擔、信誠三千一百擔、長和二千六百擔、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>大批印棉進口</h3>
<p>共計七千五百包</p>
<p>印棉近年在華銷路退化、進口逐漸减少、由孟買來滬之英輪、向以棉花爲大宗、每次祇少須五六百噸、以至一二千噸不等、今則一落千丈、减爲一二百噸、以至一二千噸不等、今則一落千丈、减華之不景氣、昨據本埠大英公司稱、下午三時該公司梅捷浦爾號進口、裝有印棉七千五百包、計重一千五百餘噸、此爲近數月内印棉進口、最巨之數云、</p>
<h3>美棉現貨需要轉佳</h3>
<p>－國漲二十磅音左右－</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>粉巿多空勢均力敵</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午開盤後、各月份巿氣、呈初平繼穩之象、以洋麥報價、雖上落仍少、芝加哥計好四八分不等、坎拿大小四分左右、惟開價後、因廠家出入不多、業外浮多則微有收進、人心趨堅、迨至下午開盤、各月份大致盤旋、本月份廠家略有開出、遠期則稍有拉進、不過結賬已近、業内外均從事結束、雖政府麥聞又將進口、數約三四千噸、正與廠商接洽中、但巿塲人心、終以多空勢均力敵、未看過落耳、結果本月份不動、三月份較好五釐、四月份好七釐半、五月份好一分、六月份好一分半、七月份好一分七釐半云、</p>
<h3>陰變元獨跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮衆來源仍稀、共計近二十號、（三千餘包、其中猶以晚稻居多、而客帮包胃亦復暢辦二千餘包、巿况以時將年關、終屬平平、已有結束氣槪、故青角．松泗．晚稻行情仍無上落、而本街店胃大勢亦屬相仿、因之常帮蘇同南港等粳及杜　洋尖悉屬定局、僅陰變元雖爲時令要貨、然究以至貨太湧、供求不和、以致巿色猶覺暗淡、貶落尺許耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日各帮來船十三四號、巿上各貨去胃轉呆、包胃因已結束不動、白粳高貨平定、中次加角許、白元羊杜埠尖價挺數分、陰元早薄稻客尖定立、</p>
<h3>黃荳廠家辦胃忽濃</h3>

<h3>絲茶黃白廠經綢銷轉暢</h3>
<p>▲日絲出口减少三成去冬各國絲業代表在巴黎開國際絲業大會、議决限制日絲傾銷、茲悉英法美印等國絲織業已先後實行議决案、是以日絲輸出减少三成、上月（卽一月）中橫檳神户各輸出港日絲出口共祇八萬零五百四十八包云</p>
<p>▲無錫絲頭陸續運滬邇來無錫各絲廠商、因鑒海外絲銷發動、咸將存貨分批運滬、最近數日中、絲廠長吐與湯繭等已裝到三百四十擔、上棧待售、</p>
<p>▲廠經綢門銷路轉暢内地各綢廠、以春綢銷路發動、分起復工、生絲需要激增、鑒於滬白廠經與黃廠經價已跌至最低限度、繼起抛購、成交不弱、計杭滬兩埠綢商進黃白廠經八十包、價已漲起三四十元、歐美各莊仍以談價不合、成交有待、</p>
<h3>英倫祁門紅茶暢銷</h3>
<p>英倫茶巿、據本埠英商行家接到之情報、近來頗有顯著之進步、我國高莊祁門紅茶、其中條子優秀、與香味見佳者、在十二月及一月份之交、銷路異常神速、價格逐步上漲、商家頗多獲利、現下高莊存底、幾已完全售清、惟低莊次貨、尤其是兩湖低莊紅茶、因去年錫蘭．印度茶生產旺盛、銷路頗受擠塞、此種提高抑低巿面、與去年同時、適成一反比例云、</p>
<h3>五金會司鐵漲風重起</h3>
<p>五金巿面已呈收束氣象、客户亦忙於結束賬務、巿情頗覺冷落、故欲各貨發展、殊甚困難、惟在上前二星期中萎靡不振之會司鐵巿面、前昨頓改舊觀、非但出路順利、售價則已飛騰、查現貨已覺有限、而來源亦告歉薄、人心奇挺、廠家若華成．中國．天安諸廠均有收辦、而客帮若大信成等亦竭力收羅、故於二日間已訂出一千四百餘箱、價格最初爲二十六元五角、絡繹加至二十八元、如眞眞老鋼廠貨竟升至三十元、聞海外定價每箱要美金七元五六角、比前亦好起二三角、是以本埠標凖、恐有漲而無跌也、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論舊歷年與舊歷</h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>自從政府當局通令絶對廢棄舊歷應用新歷以來，每年的舊歷年人民還是在熱烈地過年，這其間究竟是什麽道理？政府當局對於廢棄舊歷應用新歷的執行方法，也就入微到了相當的程度了，如政府機關不准放假啦，舊歷的歷書不准販賣，以及日歷上報紙上不准新舊歷日合用啦，商家的節期收賬改爲一年四季啦，等等方法都已執行，可是逢節逢年，人民還在沿舊守禮，視公令有如具文。現在我們先來討論舊歷究竟對於人民有什麽値得留戀的地方吧。舊歷的一年十二個月對於氣候上的春夏秋冬四季，預測得也就很凖確，一二三月是春天，四五六月是夏天，七八九月是秋天，十月十一月十二月是冬天，大抵氣候差不多是溫和，炎熱，凉爽，與寒冷，沒有什麽并得太遠的，這是其一。舊歷對於朔望，特别是十五的望日，月亮總是圓的，潮汐也就很凖確，這對於忘記今天是那一天的人，一看月亮的圓缺上絃下絃也就立刻知道，這是其二。舊歷有了這兩種大特癥，對於農民與漁夫的耕種與下海是認爲便當得多。此外，舊歷在社會上便沒有好處了，而新歷因爲成爲世界的公歷，在海禁已開，華洋往來很爲繁劇的現在，新歷反而比較舊歷便當適宜。然而無論是鄕村的農民與漁夫，或是城巿的小巿民，都在「違令」地通行舊歷，這其間除了農民與漁夫在耕種與下海打漁上有其實際的用處外，城巿的小巿民對於舊歷却有經濟上的受益呵。舊歷是三年一閏，五年二闰，月小二十九天，月大也只有三十天，（新歷月小三十天，月大三十一天，只有一個月的二月二十八天，但不常有，不過今年就是二十八天，）商家以月結賬，三年就多了一個月的入欵，而且日子又短，容易到月，一特别是店員們的工錢收入，利益多大？這就是城巿小巿民堅持地保守着奉行陰歷的最大原因。</p>
<p>然而，在上海的二房東有好多也在對於三房家迫行陰歷計算的收租，這却是二房東對於三房客的額外橫征。三房客大多數是生活不優裕的勞苦人家，被二房東這一額外橫征，損失實在不少，比方一個新歷計算月薪的人，付房租却是以舊歷計算月租，那他三年就多付了一個月的房租，現在二房東在作减租運動，三房家對於這一額外橫征亦應提出反對。最沒有理由的，却是法租界的公寓也在以陰歷計算收租，作者就曾經受過二房東與公寓老板的這種跡近敲詐的剝削，現在願意爲受剝削者在這裹向他們提出抗議。希望二房東們（公寓老板亦屬二房東之流）顧念窮苦人家的房租錢亦是由血汗得來的，（我們作者的賣文爲生的人們，却是絞盡腦汁得來的，）你們在作减租運動爲的是减輕生活的負担，三房客的生活的负担亦應該减輕的呵。</p>
<p>言歸正文，舊歷對於農民與小巿民旣然是在生活上有利，所以舊歷儘管廢除而一般的小百姓依舊認清了「爆竹一聲除舊」的景象，不肯弄差的，政治的設施，本來是以人民的生活爲主題，人民的生活旣然需要舊歷，那怕你「三令五申」而「陽奉陰違」的脾氣仍然不改，這是人民的迷信爲奉行舊歷的特廢，那就有了不明瞭社會現象的錯誤。</p>
<h3>反理想的女人</h3>
<p>— 乃碩</p>
<p>前一向，在本刊上寫了一篇理想的女人，鵬看了對我的批評是：「你倒曉」</p>
<p>得這麽許多的花頭經！可是言猶未盡呢！」會着一蘋，他便說：「談了大半天的女人，還說是外行，我將給你一頓質難！」日昨碰乂姑娘，（忝爲劉半農先生信徒，第一遭稱女士曰姑娘）以她那樣溫柔的豐采，竟對我那篇胡謅的文章大興問罪之師，說不但是理論錯誤，而且太侮蔑了她們。本來，老實人說老實話，那文章確是胡謅的，半夜裹睡不着覺，或者是必要凖備後幾日的開支，于是乎指就有些兒癢，就那麽胡謅一陣。這世界，要眞正發揮什麽大道理，是頗困難的。還是胡謅一陣吧，這，只不，過贏得所謂革命者的一聲「沒落的崽子」，這我毫不理會。</p>
<p>言歸正傳</p>
<p>乂姑娘第一點指摘我的錯誤，說是我太注重女人的美了，她說她並不反對美的女人，祇是不能把重心放在美的一點。若是這樣錯誤的去理想，將會因現實的不允許，容易得到難實現的悲哀。因爲美是究有標凖的，你說她美，却會有人更美；更美之上更有更美的出來。並且通常美的女人，就不能全美。假使要追求一個全美的，那便非到幻想界裹去尋找不可。光只顧到美的要求，這是對理想的女人的根本錯誤。就現實講，美的女人是很難找到的。再者一個美的女人就很難得共同艱苦。她常會因她天賦的姿容，要求一種高度的物質享受。一個現代的青年是始終難得滿足她這點的。那管掙扎的滿足了她，然而也不値得。因爲一個沒有犧牲性的女人就是個没有愛情的女人。而爲着一個没有愛情的女人，去獻呈自己的生命，未免是不智已極。就是美的女人有生性很好的也未必能一同吃苦，更未必能忠誠的愛你，何况生性好的女人是極少極少的呢。</p>
<p>第二點，她對我的要求性格的溫柔，也表示反對，說是無異把女人當做附物，是大錯而特錯。在現在我們要認清，男人簡直沒有一點權力去使女人成爲男人的寄生虫，或附有物。在歷史和近代先進國家裹，女子已顯示了具有和男子一樣的權能。她們能掌握生產的事情，並能担承其他重要的政治和文化的工作。我國的女子雖然比較落後點，然而當代青年的男人，却祗能去帮助她們，使她們一天一天的平分這人類社會的各種事情，趕快走上經濟的社會的平等地位，而絶不能再助長她們的倚賴性，去把她們收爲家庭的附庸，收爲專唱着曲兒的金絲鳥。</p>
<p>第三點，她說我對女人的思想要求也是根本錯誤的。說我完全想否認女人的單獨存在，而祇想把她成爲一已的玩物。一個現代的青年而有這種思想，應該是多麽的慚愧，說我那樣看待女性，究有什麽權利可以憑藉呢？</p>
<p>她說我們對于女性是萬不能存有這種使她成爲附庸或者使她成爲玩物的心理的。並且不能把理想的女人專建在美的一點上，無論如何這是一個莫大的錯誤。一個人對于女人的要求，要少着重于她的美的方面，而應該多注意于她的思想與性格。對于美的方面，只應要求她有一幅發達匀稱，健實的女性的身體，而不應要求她有花一般的容貌。對于思想與性格方面，則一定要要求她：第一點，她應當對社會，對她個人的生活有堅定的認旘；第二點，她起碼要能够有生活的技能；第三點，她要有和你共同艱苦生活的决心；第四點，她要有她的個性。不注重于她的認識，就是等于不注意男女共同生活的目標；不注重于她的生活的技能，就是等于不注重男女生活基礎的鞏固；不注意她對生活奮鬥的决心，就是等于不注重她對你的愛的持久；不注重她的個性，就是等于不注</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>重她對於你精神上的帮助。一個于年假使他這樣不注重于他的理想的女人，他對于其他的事的含混也可想而知。因爲一個當代的青年，起碼就不能對生活有種安慰的想望。起碼他的生活是充滿了艱困和鬥爭。</p>
<p>最後她說，所以我看了你那篇文章，我就覺得有和你說這麽一套話的義務。你那完全是種不正當的希求，簡直像和影子在爭高低。</p>
<p>乂姑娘說了這麽一大串，道理雖然不錯，實際上也和我一樣的在胡謅，她這眞正是「理想」，是「道地的理想」。我眞不敢領敎。所以我在臉袋略略從紅之下，只回答了這麽一句：</p>
<p>「姑娘呀！你們自己招來的理想果眞比我的高哪！」</p>
<p>心下藴蓄着笑：原來姑娘的面袋及其他，隔我的「理想」足有十萬八千里之遙。我那裹希望呢，老實說！（完）</p>
<h3>談喝酒</h3>
<p>— 阿曇</p>
<p>昨天談了一遍酒，今天再想談一談喝酒，據周作人先生說，外國人雖則不解飲茶之道，但頗知喝酒，其實外國人的喝酒，是只知其一不知其二。</p>
<p>按喝酒本來有兩種喝法，一文一武，一南一北，『氣如長鯨吸百川』『喉如焦釜氣如奔雷』武喝也北派也『淺斟低酌』文喝也南派也。</p>
<p>武喝，北派之中也有二種，一種是平凡的志在喝酒，一種是不平凡的志在吞酒的『氣勢』，平凡的一種，勞動者行之，他們做了十二小時苦工以後，買一包花生米，打四兩白幹，隨便喝喝，完就走，不平凡的一種，一定要是燕趙豪士，在白草黃沙的塞外，牧馬悲鳴，雄關突兀，巨權在手，對月鯨吞，焚野草烤新打着的飛禽，且喝且歌，淋漓慷慨，</p>
<p>文喝南派之中，也有二種，不過同樣是平凡的，他們的分别是在目的是不是喝酒，空齋無人，唯聞落葉，自取小杯，徐斟細飲，這是在辨酒的『味』，雖則不一定喝得多，但是目的是在喝酒本身，還有一種是兩三閑漢，坐在酒店裹裸臂蹺脚，酒杯方纔碰着嘴唇，立刻又放下來，這一種目的不在喝酒，而在消閑，卽使時時舉杯，也不過裝裝樣子，</p>
<p>武喝北派的方法，宜用麥酒．汾酒，速飲速醉，文喝南派的方法，宜用米酒·紹酒，不一定醉，或則根本不要喝醉，外國人的一味狂吞，明明是武喝而非文喝，明明是北派而非南派，故曰「只知其一不知其二，」</p>
<p>喝酒應該目中有酒，口中有酒，心中有酒，不是這樣，就解消了酒的嚴重性，歪曲了酒的意義，淳于髠一斗亦醉，一石亦醉，當他喝酒的時候，目視美色，目中無酒心念美人，心中無酒，所以卽使口中有酒，也不當他是酒，於是一斗之量，就可以飲一石，自然喝酒是唯物的，明明有酒喝下去，那末他的喝醉與否也是决定的，而一部份人的喝醉與否却是觀念决定，我們鄕下就有望酒旗而醉的人，他從家裹出來沒有喝酒，十分清醒，當他一望見酒旗時，立刻語言模糊，脚步歪斜的醉了起來，直到喝飽了酒回去，一路上爛醉如泥，但一看見家門，却又清醒了，這自然因爲望見酒旗，想到酒味，而不覺陶然，望見家門，想到老婆的面色，而不覺清醒，但是拿來證實一部份的喝醉與否，是觀念决定的已經够了。</p>
<p>當然上邊所說的喝酒，無論那一派，那一種，中間有一點是共同的，就是喝酒出於自願，完全看自己的高興與否，沒有非喝不可的苦衷，不過天地之間，竟有非喝不可有事實，在長者之賜，酒令輸了罰酒，無論矣，魏晋時人，因爲吃了王石散，非喝酒不能散發，因此他們就拼命喝酒，此時喝酒，就成了風氣，非喝酒就不足以成名土，直到目前，尙且有文人（不管海派與京派）拿喝酒來表示自己風雅。</p>
<p>喝酒是能够使人忘了現實的，所以從前犯人隨斬，總給他喝一點酒，但是在犯人中，竟有不肯喝酒而要清清楚楚的看着儈子手刀劈下來的人，這種舉動實在呌弱者自覺慚愧，儈子手在執行以前總是喝一點酒壯壯膽，那末碰到這樣的犯人，我眞不知道他有何面目動手？</p>
<p>「人頭作酒杯」而他們却正喝得起勁呢。</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>看哪！有了專門技術的人</h3>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>我每閱報至業餘信箱欄的時候，又感到先生善於解答，關於個人的處境。社會的趨勢，都一一的爲人解得清晰明瞭，眞令人閱之痛快！現在我有個重大的問題，在腦海裹日夜的旋轉，委實我自己解答不下，所以今天特地來請敎先生，量先生也會不吝指敎吧：</p>
<p>我是生長在最守古風的　　裹，自幼就讀私塾，這樣讀了五　　　我感到在這時代，非進學校不　　　入高等小學肄業。畢業後本待　　就要升學的，因爲要想學些專門技術，不願意入普通中學，又繼續改讀經書。這樣又讀了二三年，因之四書五經都曾讀過。那時候有主張我敎書的，有主張我在家料理家事的，我因爲要想學專門技術起見，對于這些意見一槪沒有接受，終于進了當時很負盛名的省立職業學校染織科。畢業後．以學校機械太簡單，乃由學校派送到省辦第一紡織廠實習了六個月，期滿了因無工作，又由敎廳介紹，來到上海某著名紡織廠，經檢騐後，自備餐宿進廠實習。過了四個月光景，恰巧某紡織廠招考工業生巡塲，我就應考，幸被錄取，于是又進廠實習。這樣每月拿些津貼又實習了半年，及到去年下期，衣食問題都毋須担憂了，自以爲職業已有着落，以後祗要邁步前進，就有辦法的。誰知在廿三年，我的職業，竟沒有了，變成「失業」了。可憐！我爲了「職業」二字。整整費了我五年的寳貴光陰，花了家中許多血汗金錢，那曉得到今天連要想再去實習，都找不到處所，飄落在數千里外的嚴寒暴風下餓着肚皮。唉！職業，你眞害人不淺呵！</p>
<p>編者先生，我這樣的處境，你指示我怎樣去奮鬭呢？</p>
<p>現在敎部不是高唱着提倡職業學校嗎？各省私立的中學不是要改立職業學校嗎？請問編者先生，這一批一批的從職業學校裹跑出來的職業生，到那裹去？敬祝撰安！　　　張善長謹啓</p>
<p>編者按：「職業」並不害人，「專門技術」更不害人。這些不但不害人，而且是社會上人人都應有的。但，張君，什麽害苦了你呢？是現在這個不合理的社會害了你。</p>
<p>現在這個社會，已到了日暮途窮的境界，所以「失業」並不是一種，奇特的現象，反是必然要產生的事。而在這個社會下的個人，爲他個人謀出路，不論他想用什麽方法，結果恐怕都是沒有用的，除了少數人有特殊機會之外。因爲現社會中每個人所遭受的「失業」痛苦，大多數不是由于他個人的缺點所致，而是社會制度的破綻之驅使。因些，個人想以專門技能服務于社會，生存于社會，照理講，本是于個人于社會都有益的事，但「社會」的病根在未𢬌去之前，專�</p>
<p>門技術人才仍免不了沒落的危險。失業不是個人的事，不是個人所能設法避免，而是整個的社社問題，是需由整個的社會改造纔能解决的，所以，整個的社會有出路，個人亦都有出路，否則，單靠個人的努力，那正如與買彩票差不多，得到獎金的固不是沒有人，但是少得很。</p>
<p>爲張羣目前生活着想，那唯一的辦法，還是盡可能地去謀職業。如乏人紹介，那可向中華職業敎育社登記及投函本報本埠增刊自我職業介紹欄内徵求職業，這是「盡人事」的辦法，究竟有無效果，却不敢說。</p>

<h3>孤獨的人（九）</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>（五）夜話</p>
<p>克佳和靜宜結婚後幾天。春天的日子飛得那般快，恕我記不起倒底是幾天了，其實就是記清楚了也沒有多大關係的。</p>
<p>靜文的母親己搬進了新屋。實踐了「媽和妹妹一同出嫁」的戲話。她自己每天忙碌着，說一定不回杭州去做不上學敎員了。每天的奔走就是爲了請一可個惟繼續她職位的人。效蓀是矛盾地生活着，他厭棄上海：然而他也愛戀杭州，和愛戀上海一樣。似乎在高興的時候，無論住在什麽地方都好，克佳要他住到新屋裹去，他就毫無意見地住下來了。</p>
<p>茉一個晚上，靜又送她的替身到杭州去，這里人在「滿室生春」的新房中談天。克佳和靜宜相偎地並坐在沙發中，老太太靠在床上，她永遠是微笑阒－一個慈祥的中年婦人，效蓀坐在寫字台上，一條腿支着地，那一條腿架在膝上搖洩。每個人嗑着瓜子，，抓到一個機會，無目的地說俏皮話。</p>
<p>「瓜子殻吐到地上，爲什麽向天的居多數？」效蓀得意地發了問題。</p>
<p>六對眼睛同時向地板上射射。</p>
<p>「據說是　徵　偶，女子往往是那樣持矜的不　理男子的。」</p>
<p>「我們的小妹妹，是這樣嗎？」显然這是個說俏皮話的好機會，　　抓住　　靜宜嘴角向下一沉，那樣撤嬌地推着克佳，似乎說他你看，被他便宜了。然而她不肯服輸：「是的！這樣可以使一個男子失戀。」</p>
<p>她咬着嘴唇，目光從克佳母親的面前停留到效蓀的面上，三個人同時笑了起來。效蓀也免强地做了個笑容，停止了架在膝上搖洩的腿，注視着地上的瓜子殻出神。三月的春風從窗口送來，以動了他天然的鬆曲的頭髮。</p>
<p>一個聰明的女子懂得一切的，一個聰明的男子也懂得一切的；自然一個聰</p>
<p>明的中年婦人更懂得一切，這時候老太太稍稍提高了喉嚨說：</p>
<p>「姊妹兩人眞是一樣的。說話沒有頭腦。」她返顧頭來「朱先生爲了徐小姐還不預備娶夫人嗎？」老太太故意笑着說，不致使自己的話着了邊際。</p>
<p>「那裹話？伯母。」效蓀搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮，「沒有一個女子願意嫁給我哩！」他也故意笑着說，似乎想把題拉開去。</p>
<p>「哼！」靜宜冲了出來「等勤護離了婚嗎？」</p>
<p>好像誰都沒有預料似的，停止了說話，停止了嗑瓜子。效蓀背過手去在寫字檯上的烟罐里抽出一枝烟來，燃了火，白色的烟隨了春風向窗外飛散，輕輕地。老太太站起身來，打了個哈欠。</p>
<p>「靜文不知什麽時候回來，我想去睡了。」說着自顧向外走去鐘聲打了十下。</p>
<p>「弟弟，」克佳身體移向前來，那樣正經的樣子「倒底勤護是種什態度？」</p>
<p>「什麽態度？」噴了口烟，架在膝上的腿搖洩起來。</p>
<p>「聰見那天她的態度…態度…」勤蓮家他不熟悉道一類的適當措辭，身體重倒在沙發背上，望着靜宜，自然是討救兵了。</p>
<p>「你們那天談了很多的話吧？」談談地，預防神經質的反應。</p>
<p>「是的。那天我們在南京路兜了個圈子，和少爺離婚或者是意料中事。她離我而去，嫁這末一個資本家的丈夫，總不致於還戀戀我這個無足輕重的人。但是她說少爺不是個人，和我表示親熱，是再需要我做一次傀儡。靜宜的話猜中了她的一方面，你們以爲我是這樣一個人嗎？」</p>
<p>神經質地笑起來笑聲那樣難廳，像夜半的貓頭鷹。他把烟昆成　的向窗外抛去，身體從寫字台滑到寫字椅里。</p>

<h3>逹利歐氏預言　好萊塢今年的動向（下）</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>嘉寳將永遠脫離影壇</p>
<p>范朋克將重返好萊塢</p>
<p>瑪麗壁克馥的命運，也滿佈着烏雲。特别是在年底，她將碰阒很多的荊棘。她此後將從事寫作；在兩年以内，她將著成一部很有價値的廻憶錄。今年她將攝製一片，可是這片子不見得能出色．</p>
<p>康絲登裴揑（Constance　Bennett）今年紅運高照，她將有驚人的發展。她今年沒有離婚的可能性。在健康上，她須特别留意，尤其是應該避免動用手術</p>
<p>德國明星麗琳哈蕙今年將返歐洲。　　以上，我們節譯了十大女星今年的命運。現在再來看看男明星方面的事變如何。</p>
<p>約翰巴里穆亞的流年平平。他的作品依舊成功。家事方面很快樂，並將得一子。</p>
<p>里昻巴里穆亞呢？他今年將遇着很大的危險．陰雲遮住了他的逹運。</p>
<p>約翰吉爾伯幸運不壞。或者今年，或者明年，他將抱雙生子，而且是一對千金。他的命上沒有兒子。</p>
<p>克拉克蓋伯爾的健康仍不見好轉。可是他將舉行婚禮。</p>
<p>却爾福雷今年在銀幕上又要大顯身手。他的婚姻問題也將圓滿地解决。危險的時期已經過去了！</p>
<p>埃德門羅（Edmund　Lowe）和李利恩泰喜門（Lilyan　Tashman）今年最好不要坐飛機。假如不然，那結果不是受傷，就是跛掉一隻腿或兩隻腿。</p>
<p>加利古柏（Gary　Ccoper）今年還是要守獨身生活。他今年將因飛行受驚。</p>
<p>不久他將要發一筆財－－但絶不是由演戲得來，大槪以油礦居多。</p>
<p>范朋克要吃點晦氣，並且將失去健康。他將從英國回到好萊塢。</p>
<p>小范朋克也要回到好萊塢。據圓光所示，如果他今年結婚，那這個婚姻仍舊是沒有好結果的。他最好能在影戲界以外找到一個女人．</p>
<p>亞道爾夫孟郁今年又將結婚。他這一次的夫人將是一個影界外的女人。這一次可以偕居到老。</p>
<p>卓别麟今年將產出一部頗有價値的影片。他馬上就要和寳來高逹爾（Paulette　Gbddatd)結婚了。這一段婚姻今年一定保持得很美滿。可是假如不然的話，那今年的糾紛就多了。</p>
<p>除開關於影星生活的預言之外，逹氏對於好萊塢整個影壇的動態也給了相當的指示。他說今年美國的電影業有回復繁盛的趨勢。今年將出現許多新公司，許多新明星。（完）</p>

<p>The　Chief</p>
<p>一個在播音臺大享盛名的角色，居然給製片家作爲銀幕上的號召者，這在營業競爭的立塲上，並不是過份的事。卽如中國王旡能或江笑笑之流，由堂會而上銀幕，不是同樣也受着絶大的歡迎麽？此外爲「魔俠吉訶德」的大歌家夏里賓，亦在銀幕哄動一時。因此，埃德溫也就自播音臺而移至銀幕了。</p>
<p>埃德溫在播音臺所叙述的故事中，曾經有這「笨英雄」．頗爲人們所稱道。在這故事中，他是詼諧的譏諷了所謂英雄。</p>
<p>所謂亨利者，是因公而亡的救火會的主事，巿人感其德，以英雄之子的英名加諸亨利。然而亨利實際上並非英雄，相反的，他不過是一個笨拙而忠厚的庸人。可是，埃德溫却使也在偶然的機會中建立殊勛，這偶然的機會，自然都是使人們作爲助笑之資料的。他與熊搏鬭，他和猴子扮鬼臉。同樣，也就有許多人，利用他的名字作爲競選之工具，而且亦有人因其爲自己的政敵，故而加害於其母。結果，這一们英雄，爲了營救母親而爲奸滑的政客號召選舉票。</p>
<p>在這中間，他很尖銳的譏諷了這位英雄，同時他也同情了英雄忠厚的心腸，甚至於說明他不會戴紳士的高帽和夜禮服。而如此英雄，始終是給官僚政客所利用的。不是嗎？你把他當作任何種傀儡都好，他並不會感受這莫可明言的悲哀。此所謂英雄，可憐亦復可笑。如此說來，「笨英雄」自有其深切的意義。</p>
<p>但是在表現方法上，却不見如何成功。埃德溫的表演，是趕不上故事之精采的，雖然他說白的語調，很値得人們注意。</p>
<p>至於導演的手法，亦無特殊可取之處。最値得提及者便是那由靜的空氣中轉到高潮。當亨利在深夜發現母親被刦之後，在大聲呼喚媽媽的當中，開始逼近了高潮。其後接着亨利緊張的至其所屬的公司，再接母親平和的感化盜匪，然後便是亨利的發狂，在街上狂奔大喊。這一個高潮一落，便是故事的終結。在播音臺歸至本題的時候，雖不計好中國觀衆，然而這正是埃德溫的劇旨。</p>
<p>雖然如此，這在美國喜劇電影中，並沒有優越的成績，不過是還過得去罷了。</p>
<h3>獵艷家</h3>
<p>— 李曼</p>
<p>Facing　the　Musie大上海映</p>
<p>「獵艷家」又是一張空虚而無聊的音樂喜劇片。</p>
<p>所以在這裹免不了又要來上一套陳舊的法寳，矯揉的造作，無鄒的追逐，荒唐的笑料…　　故事只有三句话，青年　克在戲院裹看中了妙齡女郎娓娜，於是他便想盡種種方法去追求她，終於逹到他最後的目的。</p>
<p>在這裹，史丹盧璧諾曾跌了址幾交，撞了一二十個陌生人，打破了八九個瓶子，在沙發下毛堆裹躱藏了六七次……這些，就是這些消耗了「獵艷家」全部的膠片。</p>
<p>然而導演Harry　Hughes在這裹處理的手腕是値得贊賞的，他在這裹，把音樂歌舞和滑稽的動作處理得互相恊調。在最後機個塲面裹，舞台上在舞蹈，而台下史丹盧璧諾和賊徒在追逐，他處理得有條不紊，先一個畫面是舞台上在舞蹈，接着是史丹盧璧諾等偷偷入座，再一個畫面是舞中在舞蹈，再接着史丹盧璧諾的逃遁和賊徒的追逐，再是舞台上在舞蹈，再是………</p>
<p>而還有些地方處理得很簡潔，如街上軍隊整齊的步伐，到室　内演員的步伐，室内演員在台上的歌唱等幾個塲面。</p>
<p>下列幾個地方：</p>
<p>（一）史丹盧璧諾翻電話簿子，找妄造的名字。</p>
<p>（二）娓娜以，‘Ｔhis　is　to　love”一書示賈克，而賈克以“Hold　my　Heail”一書交娓娜。</p>
<p>比較還生動和自然，其餘呢像「桃李芬芳」等其他的音樂喜劇片一樣，一切都是勉强，無聊，荒謬，不通，雖然這裹有了「浮士德」裹的「寳歌」來號召。</p>
<p>至於表演，史丹盧璧諾的胡閙的本領是値得一提的，然而至多，和羅克，勞萊哈代等一樣使有閒者暫時嘻開嘴巴以外，他不能給予我們一些像卓别麟所給予我們的那比較深長的意義。</p>
<p>飾娓娜的南珊勃因演得很好。</p>
<h3>島格拉斯范朋克　决絶遠去之一因</h3>
<p>— 福</p>
<p>鼎鼎大名的島格拉斯范朋克，他離開了他的封邑好萊塢，他離開了他的美麗之后曼麗璧克福而去到英國倫敦。并有有人說他將不再回好萊塢。或者他還要創立一個英國影片公司，來和美國影片競爭。於是一般人就覺得島格拉斯范朋克，卽不至於有什麽叛國的行爲，但他和美國影界之間，一定有一個裂痕存在，使他不滿之後，决絶而去的。</p>
<p>但是這個决絶的原因，是什麽呢？這是很難以知道的。就是有人知道了，亦决不肯在報紙上公佈的，因爲美國不是還期待著他的回去嗎。這位武俠明星，卽使在美國的影界，已成爲半過去的人物了，但美國的颢界，亦决不肯輕輕放他歸順到敵人方面去的呀。但是范朋克爲什麽這樣對於美國一般人負氣呢。</p>
<p>聽說他和美國的影界，並沒有什麽深仇大恨。不過他對於美國社交界之曾一次奚落他，却甚爲憤懑的。這或者是使在外國尋求光榮的一個原因。美國的社交界（Society）本來是一極端嚴格的。他們是最高級的一個小圈圈，非但沒有錢，沒有地位的人，擠不進去，卽一班暴發户，亦是對之望洋興歎的。島格拉斯范朋克自影界成名之後，就很想擠進加利福尼亞聖塔巴直拉（Santa　Barbata）的社交界。可是那班社交界的人物，竟不願開放他們的門户，讓好萊塢的人物進去。因此，范朋克就一憤而去。他和曼麗到了倫敦，英皇還庭見了他們呢。</p>
<p>以一一節，是否卽是范朋克和本國社交界發生裂痕的　因，不得而知。但這件的發生，確是實在的。</p>

<h3>克利斯丁娜Queen　Christina（七）</h3>
<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>那少年欽差聽店主人的話，很高興的說道：「倘能今晚得一安身之地，那是再好沒有的了。」店主人於是又對着克利斯丁娜道：「先生，你的房間是敝店最好的一間……不知道可以不可以請你和這位先生合住一天……」克利斯丁娜的氣，有些短促了。她的眉毛抬高了。那少年欽差看見了，就對着她道：「先生，我很不應該强迫你，但是……」他笑了一笑，而克利斯丁娜的心裹却未免跳了一跳。少年欽差很熱誠地望着她道：「我覺得還有多許可以談談……」克利斯丁娜道：「和你談話是很有趣的……」她的眼睛轉了一轉．就不說下去了。那店主人覺得她有些讓步了，於是就在一旁　掇着。那少年欽差又說道：「我可以和你說一晚上的話。我亦可以一句話不說。隨你吩咐……我所要求的，不僅是一張床－我還想和你談談家鄕的事呢！」</p>
<p>克利斯丁娜對他看着，覺得十分爲難。最後她低低的說道：「我情願讓出那間房，自己在這裹烤烤火好了。」那少年滿面顯着羞漸的神氣道：「我的禮貌，使你計厭嗎？我的言語，使你疲倦嗎？如果你覺得我太沒有意思了，請你恕我。」他說着站了起來，鞠着一圙躬，向克利斯丁娜道了晚安；就要走開了。克利斯丁娜連忙將他喚住，於是那少年又坐下來了。他說：「這件事我們不談了。我今晚在這裹烤烤亦好。」克利斯丁娜連忙阻止他道；「不興，不興，我不能讓你獨自在這裹烤火，我和你同房好了。」那少年好像恐怕變卦似的，連忙起來道謝，并且拿一隻臂膀，加在克利斯丁娜的嬌小的肩胛上，表示着親熱道：「我一完極力使你快樂。」</p>
<p>店主人看了，得意非凡的立卽將他們二人領到樓上房間裹，那裹有一個很風騷動人的侍女，跪在地下，替他們除去了皮靴。一回兒那個侍女去了，剩了他们二人在屋子裹。他們面面相顧地看着，各人覺得各人的胸膛裹，有一種奇妙莫名的情感衝動着。最後那少年西玼牙人開言道：「我的名字呌唐安東尼歐，宥斯，密吉爾，特拉柏拉都，畢問德里公爵（名字的全文），西班牙，亞雷剛，凱絲蒂爾（西班牙屬地）王，斐列普陛下特任大使」。他說完了，靜等着克利斯丁娜宣佈她的官銜姓名。克利斯丁娜躊躇了一回，然後勉强說道：「我是杜好公爵」。那少年欽差站着大鏡子前面，開始要脫衣服了，不過他忽然又停止了。他很無聊似的說道：「你一定要到西班牙去游玩游玩」。克列斯丁娜很莊重地答道：「我是很想去的」。那少年欽差道：「你可以住在敝舍，你可以……」他忽然間又停止了，又覺得是那一種不可名狀之情感阻止了他。（未完）</p>

        <h1>1934.02.08</h1>
<h3>It is Reported Sun Dianying is Unwilling to Leave the Army</h3>
<p>The Main Force Vigorously Attacks the Provincial Capital for Days</p>
<p>Reserve Troops in the Rear Continuously Enter Ningxia Territory</p>
<p>The Military Commission Decides to Gradually Implement According to Established Steps</p>
<p>If Necessary, Orders are Issued to the Shanxi and Sui Armies to Coordinate Actions</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Military Commission dismissed Sun from his military post, it is rumored that Sun has sent a reply telegram to Beiping. However, all parties claim that they have not received it. Sun himself is still in the army and is unwilling to leave the army for the time being. The main force of Sun's army has been vigorously attacking Ningxia Provincial Capital for days. Reserve troops in the rear of western Sui have been continuously entering Ningxia Province. The military authorities in Beiping have decided to gradually implement methods to handle Sun's army based on the three established steps. If Sun does not come to his senses again, they will contact the armies of the five provinces of Shanxi, Sui, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to take an encirclement posture and completely resolve the situation. Since Sun has been dismissed, although there is no telegram from Shanxi to Beiping, Yan [Xishan] and the central government and Beiping have decided to take a consistent attitude. If necessary, they will order the two divisions of Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengzhou to coordinate actions. He [Yingqin] originally planned to send personnel to Shanxi within days, but because Yan has returned to Hebian Village to visit relatives, personnel will be sent after Yan returns to Taiyuan. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin said that if Sun repents, he will not pursue past offenses. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops Erect Cloud Ladders to Attack the West City</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongbin, Ma Buqing, and others sent a telegram from Ningxia at You time on the 5th, stating that the enemy in the Xiaolibaishi-Mandachiao area north of Ningxia City, led by Liu Yueting himself on the Yin time of the 4th with about three regiments, detoured from the southwest of the new city to the west bank of the Tang Canal, and fiercely fired on the west city wall, covering more than 200 Dare-to-Die soldiers, who erected several cloud ladders and fiercely climbed the northwest corner of the city wall, with extremely fierce momentum. Our defending troops calmly fought back, waiting for the enemy's ladders to reach the city wall, when they launched bombs and machine-gun fire, immediately repelling the team, causing heavy casualties. They gathered at Tang Canal, and advanced south to attack its front, while Ma's brigade attacked its right flank from the South Gate, and Ma Guangzong's cavalry regiment and the Qing army's cavalry Ma Lu's brigade detoured to its rear. The enemy was surrounded on all sides and fought fiercely all day. The enemy's momentum was unsustainable, and they retreated to various villages in the southwest, stubbornly resisting. The encirclement is still in progress. In this battle, over 100 enemies were killed, 23 enemy officers and soldiers were captured, and 12 pistols and rifles were seized. At Shen time on the 5th, approximately three brigades of enemy infantry moved north of the White Pagoda north of the city toward the northeast of the city, attempting to make a feint to the east while attacking the west. Our 35th Division and the 3rd Brigade of the 9th Division are prepared to intercept. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's army fiercely attacked Xincheng, six miles from Ningxia, again today and attempted to climb the city with ladders, but suffered heavy casualties and retreated. According to prisoners, Sun's army has lost 3,000 men since the start of the war. Several hundred others have died from exposure. They also said that Sun's army's food is dwindling. Nothing has been heard here regarding Sun's telegram expressing willingness to comply with the central government's dismissal order. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui and Others Telegraph Beiping Claiming Victory</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongbin, and others telegraphed Beiping at You time on the 3rd, saying that Sun's Ding division is currently based in the Balichiao-Zhujiazhai area north of the city, and Liu's division has fled to various villages and fortresses near Xiaolibaishi-Laoyatan northwest of the city. Their branch headquarters is located in Zhang Cheng's house at Dong Tang Canal Bridge. The army has closed off the fortresses, hurriedly building fortifications, and claiming to wait for the arrival of the 119th Division from the rear before launching another attack on the city. At dawn on the 1st, the brigade of Lu and Ma from my five routes fiercely attacked the enemy at Laoyatan and Xiaolibaishi. The 35th Division attacked the side of Xiaolibaishi from the line of Dalibaishi-Hajiazhuang-Mianjiazhuang. The 9th Division attacked the Balichiao-Jiuyingfang area from Dongjiazhai-Zhujiazhuang. The cavalry brigade raided Bawamiao and Fengdengbao, engaging in fierce fighting all day, engaging in hand-to-hand combat and charging. The enemy reoccupied the fortresses and fired intensely with guns. Our officers and soldiers bravely broke in, successively capturing Wangjiazhuang, Xijiazhuang, Tangjiqiao, and other places. Fighting is still in progress. In this battle, one enemy regimental commander Jia and Hui Gao were killed, along with over 300 officers and soldiers. 82 enemy regimental adjutants, including Lu Tianzhen, were captured, and three machine guns and over 100 rifles were seized. Our army suffered injuries to two battalion commanders and over 60 officers and soldiers. A total of five battalion, deputy, company, and platoon leaders and over 30 soldiers were killed. According to enemy soldiers of the 117th Division of Xia Weili's brigade and the He Zigang regiment Lu's regimental adjutant Tianzhen, Liu and Ding's two divisions came to Ningxia with approximately 15,000 infantry soldiers. Since the start of the fighting, mutinies and casualties have been extremely high. Each company now has only 30 to 40 men, suffering from cold and hunger, lacking morale. If this continues for a long time and food runs out, changes will inevitably occur. The forward hospital in Yaofu Fort has already admitted over 3,000 casualties, and the hospital in Wangquanying has over 1,000 wounded soldiers. The number of officers above the battalion commander who have been killed in battle has reached over 200, and the number of soldiers has reached over 2,000. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Invited Zhao Pilian Yesterday to Discuss</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang [Jingwei] invited Zhao Pilian, the Shanxi representative stationed in Nanjing, to the Executive Yuan on the afternoon of the 7th. It is heard that they discussed methods to resolve the Sun Dianying army issue. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ningxia Circles Telegraph Yan Appealing</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou Dispatch: All circles in Ningxia, because Yan Xishan of Shanxi allowed Sun's army to cultivate fertile fields, leading to Sun's army having the excuse to invade westward, previously telegraphed requesting that measures be taken to stop it. Later, according to the reply telegram, Yan agreed to do his best to stop it. The people of Ningxia believe that Sun's attack on Ningxia is becoming urgent, and he has not complied with the authorities' orders to withdraw from the territory. On the 2nd, they telegraphed Yan again, saying, "It has been found that Sun sent troops to secretly attack Dengkou, and on the night of the 13th, divided his troops to attack Shishan. Then they also fled to Huangqu Baofeng, rushing to various villages and towns in Ningcheng. The people are fleeing. In the icy and snowy weather, deaths from freezing and starvation are unbearable to hear. You, sir, are the pillar of the country and the safeguard of the Northwest. Thinking of Shanxi and Sui as one family and the people as not different from each other, we advocate fairness in restraining the army and ordering the troops stationed in Sui to prohibit Sun's troops from recruiting and transporting new soldiers. If you can quickly send troops to resolve the situation, it will not only be the blessing of the Northwest but also the good fortune of the country." (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Ambition to Advance Westward</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Military organs have received reports that Sun Dianying's disobedience and westward advance this time, ostensibly for reclamation, actually has ambitious intentions. After capturing Ningxia, he plans to start organizing a Northwest government, and then advance towards Qinghai and Gansu. If the initial plan fails, the minimum requirement is to obtain the Woye-Linhe-Wuyuan area, because Woye produces abundant wheat grains, which can be self-sufficient. Linhe has a rich opium harvest, which can be sold for money. Wuyuan is close to the Ping-Sui Railway, making transportation convenient, allowing them to be self-sufficient and gradually expand. If he is not suppressed quickly, he will cause endless trouble. Please request the Central Army and the Jin Army to join forces to eliminate him. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liang Hejun Discusses Ningxia Military News</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Hejun, the Director of the Department of Finance of Ningxia Province, is currently in Nanjing. According to his discussion, there was still a telegram from Ningxia Province on the evening of the 7th. There was only fierce fighting there on the 4th. From the 5th and 6th until now, no major battles have occurred. The telegram only stated that the sound of gunfire could be heard in Ningyuan for days. Generally, Sun's army has no sincere intention to repent. He himself has already met with Chiang [Kai-shek]. The central government has predetermined steps for Sun. The first two steps, dismissal, have already been implemented. If Sun still does not listen to orders and hand over military power, then the final effective solution will be implemented. He came from Taiyuan before, and Yan Xishan will never protect Sun in any way. From a personal perspective, resolving the Sun issue should not be a problem. He will stay in Nanjing for two or three more days and then return to Ningxia quickly. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng, after discussing the details of the takeover of Gubeikou with Wei Yonghe, the commander of the Security Corps, and Sun Shutang, the county magistrate of Miyun, etc., has generally made a decision. Yin went to Tianjin this morning to meet Yu Xuezhong to ask for instructions. He will return to Beiping in about one or two days.

Regarding the Yutian Incident, there are currently no major changes. Hu Xie'wu is still sending his subordinates to search civilian homes for weapons, taking them away to expand his troops. The Political Reorganization Council has drafted a solution and will implement it within days. The communist banditry in Zunhua and Qian'an does not involve many people. There are only two or three real communists; the rest are bandits. The provincial government is paying close attention and has ordered the county magistrate to suppress them. Liu Guitang's bandit troops have fled to Zhang County, Henan. Currently, Bai Fengxiang and Zhang Chengde's divisions are pursuing them. It is not expected that they will flee back to southern Hebei.

<h3>Ideas on Rectifying Overseas Consulates</h3>
<p>A nation's permanent overseas personnel consist of diplomats and consuls, distinct from each other. The consul's duty is solely to protect overseas citizens and develop commerce. In countries without a native ambassador, consuls may also serve as the nation's foreign representative. While the status of a consul may not be equal to that of a diplomat, they still receive special protection under international law. Public documents under their care enjoy inviolable sanctity, and they are exempt from conscription and direct taxation in their host country. According to international convention, consuls must first receive recognition from the head of the host country to officially exercise their duties. If they engage in illegal or improper conduct, the head of the host country can revoke their recognition, indirectly removing them from office. Therefore, in the strictest sense, a consul is actually subject to the control of both their home country and the host country, serving as an official of both. Their responsibility is thus quite significant.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of a Chinese consul today likely surpass those of their foreign counterparts. Chinese citizens are spread worldwide, and they have consistently provided significant assistance to the nation's economy, patriotic movements, and domestic charitable causes. In today's global economic downturn, anti-Chinese tragedies continue to occur. How can the government stand idly by? The importance of consular affairs cannot be ignored – this is the first point. Imported goods flood the market, with loopholes needing to be plugged. Domestic goods sell poorly, lacking vitality. To develop international trade, accurate and timely on-site information is essential. The importance of consular affairs cannot be ignored – this is the second point. The National Government recognizes this and has implemented measures such as cargo manifest certifications to supplement consular funding and rigorous examinations to carefully select consular officials. All of these are fundamental and self-evident. What I wish to discuss are matters no less important than funding and personnel selection, but which the authorities may not be giving sufficient attention to, or which, although the authorities have experimented with, have not been continuously promoted, and are therefore specifically highlighted.</p>
<p>(1) Formulation of Service Regulations. The tasks of a consul can be broadly divided into four categories: (A) developing commerce; (B) protecting overseas citizens; (C) supervising ships; and (D) other miscellaneous tasks. Under these general categories, the events that need to be handled are extraordinarily complex. For example, under category (A): monitoring whether domestic and host country commerce is faithfully executed, investigating the economic conditions, financial markets, and people's preferences of the host country and its neighboring areas, etc. Under category (B): paying attention to the entry and departure of domestic ships, mediating or arbitrating disputes between crew members and sailors or passengers, etc. Under category (C): handling citizen registration, inventorying and protecting the estates of the deceased, etc. Under category (D): certifying wills, witnessing weddings, issuing passports, and certifying cargo manifests, etc. Our current consular service regulations are fragmented and incomplete compared to the comprehensive and detailed regulations of foreign countries. For example, very few overseas Chinese make wills, and their registration at the consulate is often incomplete and inaccurate. If an overseas Chinese citizen dies, it is often impossible to determine who their legal heirs are. If the consul does not investigate and protect their estate, the earnings of their lifetime of labor will inevitably be confiscated by the local government and vanish without a trace. However, our government lacks detailed regulations to guide consular operations. Even those who are enthusiastic about serving will inevitably feel lost and helpless. This situation is ubiquitous overseas, and the losses of overseas Chinese property are countless. It is truly lamentable. This one example illustrates the rest.</p>
<p>(2) Promotion of Civil Registration. Many overseas Chinese leave their homeland due to economic hardship or restrictive immigration policies, leaving their families behind. If an accident occurs and they need to prove their relationship with relatives in the country, it is extremely difficult. Our new civil registration system has not been in place for long, and those in charge are perfunctory and irresponsible, regarding it as unimportant. Therefore, consuls who wish to protect the legal interests of overseas Chinese relatives often lack evidence to prove their identity and can only regret their powerlessness. Sometimes, the host country's authorities may be lenient, but the consulate must still painstakingly seek appropriate evidence from the country to gain the trust of foreigners and protect its own prestige. Therefore, the failure to implement civil registration is a national disgrace that harms overseas citizens, causing endless trouble and wasting time. While it is impossible to implement this nationwide simultaneously without any shortcomings, overseas Chinese are most numerous in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, and their ancestral homes are mostly located along the coasts of these two provinces. Implementing civil registration within this small area may not be too difficult. Moreover, once properly implemented, it will benefit the improvement of local administration, not only facilitating consular operations but also benefiting overseas Chinese communities.</p>
<p>(3) Holding Circuit Performance Evaluations. The National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously sent personnel to inspect consulates in Southeast Asia, which was quite beneficial diplomatically. However, this has not been extended to other regions, which is regrettable. In the future, we should follow the examples of other countries and commission impartial and capable personnel to regularly inspect the performance of each consulate and their relationships with local officials and overseas citizens in the host country, as a basis for rewards and punishments.</p>
<h3>Major Bloodshed in French Corruption Scandal</h3>
<p>Daladier Government Overthrown</p>
<p>Hundreds Dead and Wounded in Dark Night Battles in Paris</p>
<p>Royalist Uprising and Communist Rebellion</p>
<p>(Paris) The Daladier cabinet has just submitted its resignation. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Premier Daladier went to the Presidential Palace this afternoon to resign as Prime Minister to avoid further bloodshed. Daladier won in the Chamber of Deputies but failed in the streets. There were rumors of a general resignation this morning. According to unconfirmed reports, Daladier met with the President to discuss declaring a state of alert. Opposition leaders Tettio and Laval are currently drafting a declaration to the speakers of both houses of parliament. The vote in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday indicated that the government is socialist in nature rather than unified. With Daladier's resignation, France is now without a cabinet. Former President Doumer, although re-invited to form a cabinet in the previous nine days, declined. It is widely believed that the President will advocate dissolving parliament and holding new elections, hoping to eliminate the socialist majority. Before resigning, Daladier consulted with Interior Minister Frot, who agreed to implement the most effective plan today to deal with the rioters. Daladier stated that the government is responsible for maintaining order but does not want to use bloodshed to suppress or use troops to deal with demonstrators. Herriot attended the meeting between Daladier and Frot. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Daladier issued a statement late at night detailing the riots, saying, "This is an attempt by certain political groups to overthrow the republican system through violent coups. The rioters carried knives and guns and attacked police and guards. A detailed examination of those arrested proves that this is a violent act detrimental to national security. Fortunately, the defense was strong, and the rioters did not achieve their purpose. The government is determined to safeguard the safety of the people and the independence of the republican system by legal means and hopes that people across the country will cooperate." (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, the authorities issued a statement saying that six people died and 400 were injured and hospitalized in yesterday's riots, with demonstrators and police accounting for half each. Countless others suffered minor injuries and were treated at home. A total of 350 people were arrested during the riots and will be charged with inciting murder and conspiring to endanger national security. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the news of the fall of the Daladier government spread, crowds gathered again on Concorde Street and Royal Street. Police officers frequently used batons to disperse them, but the crowds remained and some threw bricks and stones, making the situation increasingly tense. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Fires Erupt Throughout Paris, French Government Surrounded</h3>
<p>Rioters and Police and Military Fight Like Demons</p>
<p>Injured Lie Strewn Across the Streets, Blood-Stained Clothing Scattered</p>
<p>Cleared Only After Midnight with Gunfire</p>
<p>(Paris) After a day of tension, Parisian workers gradually left their offices and factories at dusk. An hour later, the streets were filled with demonstrators, who threw glass objects at mounted patrols. Crowds along the roadside also set off firecrackers to boost their morale. At that time, the mounted patrols maintained order in a friendly manner. Shortly thereafter, communists set fire to tobacco shops, newspaper stands, and motorcycles. The situation then became tense. Guards had to use bayonets to charge at the stone-throwing rioters, but they were outnumbered and retreated. The rioters gradually advanced to the iron fence outside the Chamber of Deputies, and the French government was surrounded. Although several injured people were carried into the hospital, no one inside was allowed to leave. At the time, several right-wing city councilors marched down Rivoli Road, hoping to position themselves in front of the crowd. The most intense riot started with the battle on the Concorde Bridge in the evening. The rioters surged like a tide, and the police and Republican Guard were unable to resist. After occupying the bridge, the rioters trapped the police and were unable to stop the arson of motorcycles and private cars.</p>
<p>Crowds also set fires in other parts of the city and threw stones at police detachments. They also destroyed cafes on several historically valuable streets. The Faubourg Saint-Honoré was filled with injured people, broken glass, and blood-stained clothing. The main forces of the riot were royalists, industrial revolution unions, communists, socialists, etc. Their party newspapers all encouraged them to vigorously oppose the Stavisky corruption scandal. The riot first broke out in front of the City Hall, with the crowd shouting "Down with the government!" and "Down with Chiappe!" Seeing the crowds surging, cafe owners quickly cleared the chairs and tables from the roadside, and stores closed their doors and stored all glass objects. At 9 p.m., a team of rioters set fire to the Ministry of the Navy at the corner of Concorde Street and Royal Street. The fire brigade rushed to the scene from streets crowded with people and extinguished the fire within thirty minutes, but several houses had already been destroyed.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m., two battalions of infantry were stationed in front of the Chamber of Deputies. The soldiers all carried dry rations so that they could be stationed there all night. When the police guarding the Concorde Bridge were forced back several steps by the rioters, they fired pistols and then began a fierce fight. The mounted patrol charged six times. Reuters reporters saw at least fifteen mounted patrolmen's heads smashed by rioters with sticks and stones. The two sides advanced and retreated repeatedly, fighting like demons.</p>
<p>The second half of the riot was a battle between veterans and the Republican Guard. The veterans marched onto the scene in formation at 9:40 p.m., led by flag bearers, and a fight broke out immediately. Two fire hoses were used to spray water at them, but the old warriors did not give in. Two motorcycles on Concorde Street were burning fiercely, and no one cared. The street was filled with shoes, hats, torn clothes, broken glasses, etc. At the time, the shouts and trumpet sounds of the crowd were mixed with a strange, sharp sound, as gas lamps were broken and gas leaked out. Police officers with pistols fired along Concorde Street to drive away the crowd until after midnight. Hundreds of injured people were lying on the streets, several of whom were seriously injured. The police had tried their best to restrain themselves today, but when the rioters attacked the Concorde Bridge, the patrol team fired several volleys, killing a woman.</p>
<p>Several places such as Lyon, Marseille, Lille, and Nancy also had demonstrations and minor riots today.</p>
<p>At 1:10 this morning (Wednesday), the Prime Minister held a military meeting at the Ministry of Interior. Interior Minister Frot and other cabinet members attended. Frot gave a speech thanking the police for their efforts in suppressing the riot. At 1:40 this morning, the Concorde Street and other streets were quiet, but rioters were still demonstrating in Royal Street and other places. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Royalists Forcefully Storm Chamber of Deputies, Parliament Turns into Hospital</h3>
<p>Right-Wing Demonstrations and Communist Counter-Demonstrations</p>
<p>City Councilors Also Lead Crowds to Attack</p>
<p>Injured People's Eyeballs Burst Out, Others Arrested</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, far-right royalists demonstrated near the Chamber of Deputies, and the scope quickly expanded. The demonstrators repeatedly tried to break into the Chamber, but were stopped by guerrilla guards. In other areas, right-wing demonstrators encountered communist counter-demonstrators and clashed.</p>
<p>In front of the Tuileries Palace, demonstrators overturned three buses and seized roadside trees, benches, and streetlights to throw at the police. Deputy Inspector Marchand was injured.</p>
<p>Another team of demonstrators, led by eight members of the Paris City Council, set out from the City Hall and marched towards the Chamber of Deputies, resulting in a clash with the police. Two city councilors were seriously injured, one with an eyeball bursting out. All eight were arrested.</p>
<p>At 10:30 p.m., demonstrations broke out again on the Place de la Concorde. Right-wing people and communists clashed with each other. The police tried their best to disperse them. The Beaujon Hospital received 43 injured people, two of whom had already died, and seven others were critically injured. The number of injured people received by the Laennec Hospital and the Municipal Hospital was roughly the same, but there were no deaths yet. After the Chamber of Deputies adjourned, the government held a cabinet meeting in the Chamber. Due to the large number of deaths and injuries, it was decided to file public charges for the crimes of ordering murder and conspiring to undermine national security. After the parliament adjourned, the clerks extinguished the lights and opened the side doors so that members and observers could leave. In front of the main gate, the fire brigade used water hoses to prevent the demonstrators from advancing. A temporary military hospital was set up inside the Chamber to treat injured police and soldiers. Finally, the demonstration gradually weakened, but a large battalion of infantry was still stationed in front of the Chamber to prevent any surprises. Demonstrations also occurred in provinces such as Lyon and Rouen, but the situation was not serious. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Maurras, the editor of the royalist newspaper "Action Française," published an article yesterday, deliberately causing trouble. The court has decided to prosecute him for inciting murder. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>New Cabinet Wins Confidence After Shouting and Cheering in Chamber of Deputies</h3>
<p>Daladier Handles the Situation Calmly</p>
<p>Vote of Confidence Passed by Three Votes</p>
<p>(Paris) When Premier Daladier read out the declaration of the new government's major policies in the Chamber of Deputies today, the shouts and cheers in the hall were deafening, making it impossible to finish reading. This is unprecedented in the history of France's parliamentary system. The Speaker announced a ten-minute recess. When the meeting reconvened, the members were still very agitated. Daladier maintained the overall situation with a humorous demeanor. When the members returned to the hall, Daladier played with his hat, gesturing as if to say, "Gentlemen, if you are quiet, we can proceed with the meeting; otherwise, I will put on my hat and leave." The first gathering of the Chamber was almost immediately disrupted by the noise. When the cabinet members entered the hall, some on the left cheered, while those on the right shouted insults. Others were insulted by the left and cheered by the right. When Daladier read the declaration, the left cheered and the right shouted insults. As the members filed in, several Socialist and Radical Party members attacked several right-wing members. The hall guards used all their strength to separate the two sides. The visitors' gallery was full, and admission tickets were strictly checked 100 yards from the parliament. No one without a ticket was allowed to enter.</p>
<p>After the second gathering, Daladier finished reading his declaration and allowed only four members of the opposition to raise questions as a vote of confidence. The declaration, in addition to expressing the determination to maintain the gold standard and international cooperation, also promised that the parliamentary committee would investigate the Stavisky fraud case. Daladier also stated loudly that at a time when all of Europe is in turmoil and division, national defense is of utmost importance. We must not be confused and indecisive, bearing the blame for France falling into a new catastrophe with the rest of Europe. As for the meeting system, it should be well protected, the accounting system must be reformed, and the budget must be passed by March 31.</p>
<p>After Daladier finished his speech, the members voted on the motion of confidence after debating it, which passed by 300 votes to 217 votes.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Deputies was adjourned immediately. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Paris Resembles Battlefield After Night of Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Still in a State of Turmoil</p>
<p>Number of Demonstrators Close to 50,000</p>
<p>(Paris) Paris's beautiful Concorde Street now resembles a battlefield after a night of riots and bloodshed. Paris is still in an extremely unsettled state. Concorde Street is full of iron bars, iron pipes, bricks, and stones. It is estimated that the number of rioters is close to 50,000. The traces of destruction in the streets are enough to prove the intensity of the riot. The exterior is now protected by squads of infantry. Newspapers said that the demonstrators were mixed with communists, which caused the change. "Action Française," one of the famous political dailies, has been confiscated today. The official statement of the number of deaths and injuries in last night's disturbance is: six civilians dead, three guards missing, 170 civilians injured, 180 police injured, and 230 guards injured. Barton, the Undersecretary of National Education, resigned today. Right-wing opposition leaders have put forward a motion requesting an immediate investigation into last night's events. Paris is superficially calm now, but the atmosphere is very tense. Those who went to Concorde Street and other places for inspection this afternoon were all monitored by the police and not allowed to stay, in order to comply with the order prohibiting gatherings. There were no further disturbances or arrests at 1 p.m. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During last night's riots in Paris, an American girl was killed by a stray bullet. The Paris police chief and the famous aviator Major Herteau were also seriously injured. At the time, the crowd shouted, "Send Chiappe to prison!" and "Shoot Daladier!" After the Chamber of Deputies adjourned, the members could not leave because demonstrators were gathered outside, and the police could not guarantee the safety of the members leaving the Chamber. At the time, more than sixty injured police officers were carried into the Chamber to treat their wounds. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Process of Daladier Cabinet's General Resignation</h3>
<p>Former President Doumer Declined to Form Cabinet</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, Premier Daladier and all cabinet members resigned. After last night's riot, Socialist leader Blum and Socialist extremist leader Herriot met with Daladier and persuaded him to resign. Daladier then convened a meeting of all cabinet members. The truth of this incident is due to the dismissal of former Police Commissioner Chiappe and the repercussions of the Bayonne swindle case. Therefore, in order to avoid further riots or bloodshed, it was decided to resign en masse. As a result of last night's riot, approximately sixteen people died and one hundred and fifty-four were injured. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At 1:30 p.m., Premier Daladier left the Prime Minister's Office and announced to the press that the cabinet had submitted its general resignation, but declined to issue any other statement. Subsequently, President Lebrun re-entrusted former President Doumer with the organization of a new cabinet, but Doumer again refused to accept the mandate. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>British Parliament Debates Disarmament</h3>
<p>Simon Declaration Endeavors to Mediate</p>
<p>Serious Differences Remain in the Development of the Situation</p>
<p>Eden Travels to France, Germany, and Italy to Exchange Views</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon began the world-attracting disarmament debate in the House of Commons today. The House was extremely crowded, and many members of the diplomatic corps attended as observers.</p>
<p>Simon declared that since December 21, the situation has progressed, and the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany have all published important documents. Therefore, the situation has reached a point where a beneficial discussion can be held. Although serious differences still exist today, there has been a greater rapprochement on common grounds. Britain has received sufficient encouragement to continue to work for reconciliation, which is why Britain issued its memorandum on January 31.</p>
<p>The key to disarmament lies in the mutual concessions of France and Germany. Germany's demand for equality in armaments cannot be rejected and should not be rejected, because there can be no world peace if a great country and nation is kept in a subordinate position for a long time. If an urgent solution cannot be obtained, based on each country immediately abandoning its various war equipment that Germany is not allowed to possess, if an agreement cannot be reached quickly, Britain will have to consider its own armament, because Britain has no other way to stand in a world of endless armament.</p>
<h3>All Countries Are in Danger If Disarmament Fails</h3>
<p>British Plan Can Be a Basis for Compromise Simon also said that the British memorandum is by no means an ideal plan that disregards the needs and anxieties of others, but is presented to the world in a pragmatic spirit. Today, the times are increasingly contrary to those who advocate disarmament. The British plan is intended to lay the foundation for a swift compromise.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary referred to Germany's rearmament, saying that any convention must accommodate Germany's rearming to some extent, but if equal rights are granted without reducing armaments in any aspect, this agreement will not be welcomed by the British government. Britain does not want to join any new constraints that would lead to coercive action regardless of the circumstances. Britain will do its best to faithfully fulfill its existing obligations.</p>
<p>After stating the obligation of the signatory countries to cooperate unanimously to prevent breaches of contract, Simon declared that the British proposal is a genuine progress. The next step is to make people all over the world fully understand the British memorandum and to fully understand the difficulties of other relevant countries. Therefore, the British government is now prepared to appoint the Lord Privy Seal to travel to Paris, Rome, and Berlin as soon as possible to explain Britain's position and to inquire about the opinions of other governments on the British memorandum. Eden could have set off immediately to France, but the political situation in France made people consider whether this trip would be convenient for France.</p>
<p>Simon concluded by saying that Britain's automatic implementation of its desire for disarmament has given the world extremely obvious evidence, and it is still its responsibility to launch it again. Britain is determined to promote an international agreement, regardless of the difficulties, and to consolidate the structure of world peace by all possible means, so that it and other countries can be spared the danger and burden that an unsettled agreement will inevitably lead to.</p>
<h3>Japan's Invasion of China Shakes World Peace</h3>
<p>Labor and Liberal Party Members of Parliament</p>
<p>Criticize Government's Disarmament Proposals</p>
<p>Labor Party leader Attlee stated that recognizing Germany's equality is too late and constitutes a concession to force rather than justice. The League of Nations' policy encourages countries to withdraw from the League and advocate for war in the hope of gaining rights. Japan has become a model for all countries in the world. The world cannot extend its authority in the Sino-Japanese dispute. The idea of security has been swept away. What the Labor Party wants is security and complete disarmament. The current British plan will not achieve this goal within the next ten years.</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Samuel declared that the British proposal is uninspiring. He welcomes the agreement with Italy to improve the League of Nations. As for allowing Germany to rearm to some extent, it is an inevitable result of the principle of equality. This is not a surrender to Hitler, as all previous German governments have made this request. If the British plan is fully implemented, it could reduce armaments in Europe, but even if Europe agrees, there is no certainty in the Far East. Japan's attitude is almost completely opposed to disarmament. Japan has not yet indicated its acceptance of the proposed conditions. He hopes that the British government will not stop its progress due to the opposition of one country. He further hopes in a friendly spirit that the Japanese government will calmly consider its position, as Japan is diplomatically isolated due to its attitude towards Manchuria, economically due to its current situation in world trade, and morally and strategically due to its unique dissent and opposition to the general disarmament convention.</p>
<p>Conservative Party member Campbell advocated eliminating the causes of war, such as poorly managed borders, and suggested establishing a League of Nations court to handle complaints, with an international air force to enforce its authority. As for naval armaments, only cruisers of 8,000 tons or less are needed.</p>
<h3>Warning to Germany Not to Violate the Independence of Neighboring Countries</h3>
<p>The British Government Does Not Relinquish Trusteeship</p>
<p>Simon Only Acknowledges Equality of Rights</p>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain stated that the agreement between Germany and Poland has not been lifted. Germany's obligations under the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Locarno Treaties have not only not been relieved but have increased. This is very satisfying. It would be even more satisfying if Germany did not want to have anything to do with Austria at the same time. Germany should be given appropriate warning that the acceptance of Germany's demands must be conditional, that is, Germany must not use the strength of its armaments or the power of propaganda to express aggression against the independence of any other country, as Italy does. The former Foreign Secretary's words were met with applause. Chamberlain also said that it is now appropriate to ask Germany to frankly explain its wishes so that other countries can clearly indicate their limits. As for Germany's request for the return of its former colonies, the British government has no right to relinquish its trusteeship. If we must accept Germany's other demands, then Germany must withdraw such requests in order to reach an agreement. The Foreign Secretary Simon's statement that Germany's demand for equality of armaments cannot be rejected is dangerous, he believes. He hopes that Simon will deny that this statement implies that Germany's equality of naval armaments is also acceptable. The government party cheered loudly upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon then rose and said that if he had indeed used the term "equality of armaments," it was inappropriate. His original intention was to explain what was stated in the memorandum on armaments. The memorandum has already explained that the navy is a matter for separate negotiation. Lord Privy Seal Eden, on behalf of the government, replied that if Austria has decided to submit its dispute with Germany to the League of Nations, then this case is now in effect under trial. The actions to be taken in the future should be decided by the League of Nations Council. In joint action, Austria has the right to demand that any other country not interfere in its internal affairs. Eden also said that the British government fully agrees with the Italian government that Germany's return to Geneva to rejoin the League of Nations is the most important thing. He concluded by saying that the British government has asked other governments to accept the disarmament proposal as soon as possible, because accepting it at this time can bring the greatest political benefit to the world and generate the greatest trust among people. The government moved to adjourn the meeting, and the House of Commons agreed, ending the debate. (Transmitted by Central News Agency on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Visits Hungary</h3>
<p>Speculation About the Purpose of This Trip Varies</p>
<p>This morning, Vienna’s Prime Minister Dollfuss set off for the Hungarian capital, accompanied by the Director of the External Political Affairs Department, Paul Berlas, and the Hungarian Envoy to Austria.

<p>Rome. Hungary has officially recognized Soviet Russia, but Soviet Russia will not dispatch a diplomatic representative to the Hungarian capital until January of next year. During this time, Hungary will send Jung to Moscow. (Havas dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>Budapest. According to general speculation, Hungary's recognition of the Soviet Union is due to Italy's actions. The negotiations for Hungary's recognition of the Soviet Union were held in Rome, and the countries of the Little Entente are preparing to recognize the Soviet Union. This time, Hungary's recognition of the Soviet Union is intended to precede the countries of the Little Entente. Moreover, since the Moscow government has approached Hungary in the West, it can eventually join the League of Nations. From an economic point of view, although Hungary does not benefit much from recognizing the Soviet Union, Hungary can purchase some raw materials previously imported from the countries of the Little Entente from Russia in the future. In addition, agricultural machinery, electric seeders, and livestock produced by Hungary can be exported to Russia. (Havas dispatch from the 7th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Cotton Industry Conference</h3>
<p>To Be Held in London on the 12th of This Month</p>
<p>Japanese Economic League's Statement to Britain</p>
<p>Encouraging Britain with Coexistence and Co-prosperity</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Textile Federation received a report from its representative in the United Kingdom, Okada, that British representative Wilson visited Okada yesterday to discuss the steps for holding Anglo-Japanese cotton industry consultations. It was decided to hold the first meeting on the 12th of this month. Japanese Commercial Affairs Participant Makiyama will also participate. (China United Press dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the Anglo-Japanese consultations will be held soon, the Japan Economic League, on the 6th, sent a letter to various British parties in the name of the League President, Seinosuke Go, detailing the trade and financial relations between Japan and Britain. The reason why Japanese goods enter the European market is not intentional. Japan does not hesitate to control trade to uphold the spirit of coexistence, co-prosperity, and world peace. The last paragraph states that although we do not imagine that free trade can be realized in modern times, we do not doubt that separatist economics will lead to more tragic results. Now the world is at such a crossroads, and Japan and Britain are the Eastern and Western players repelling separatist economicism. Under this concept, we are pleased with the recent establishment of the Indo-Japanese consultations and sincerely hope that the upcoming Anglo-Japanese consultations will be successful.

<h3>Roosevelt's Focus Shifts to War Debts</h3>
<p>Two Measures Are Proposed</p>
<p>Forceful Recovery and the Establishment of Trade Agreements</p>
<p>U.S. and Russia Will Begin Debt Negotiations in Geneva</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt plans to deliver a message to Congress today, specifically discussing the war debt issue. Although the content of the message has not been announced in detail, it is generally speculated that the President is unwilling to cancel or reduce the war debts. The President's new proposal is to first obtain the support of Congress and then contact the debtor countries. As a result of recent studies by the President and experts, it is generally felt that the current situation offers little hope of recovering war debts. If war debts are to be recovered, there are only two ways: one is by force, and the other is by trade agreement. The first method is the economic boycott of the debtor countries proposed by former Representative Johnson. This proposal is currently being discussed in the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is likely to pass in the House in the future. The second method has not yet been determined, but the President has consulted with financial and agricultural advisors several times in the past two weeks, intending to conclude trade agreements with the debtor countries to export America's surplus agricultural products abroad and to increase America's foreign trade. (National News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) There is talk of Russia and the United States opening debt negotiations. Today, it was heard that more than a thousand citizens and companies petitioned the State Department to demand compensation for losses from Russia during the negotiations. The companies, because the products in Russia are owned by Soviet Russia, are requesting a total of $65 million in compensation for losses. Other requests include the repayment of Russian government bonds purchased by private individuals in the United States before the United States entered the European war.

<h3>International Journalist William Martin Passes Away</h3>
<p>Quite Capable of Upholding Justice in the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. William Martin, former editor of the Geneva Newspaper and now professor of political science at the University of Zurich, passed away here today from pneumonia at the age of forty-six. Dr. Martin was a veteran of the European press. He upheld public opinion and adhered to justice throughout his life. When the Sino-Japanese dispute was submitted to the League of Nations for discussion, the Japanese tried their best to spread propaganda unfavorable to China in various newspapers. Only this newspaper upheld justice and fully announced the truth of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast, which benefited China greatly. Dr. Martin also wrote a book, "Japan and the League of Nations in Opposition," which expounded on Japan's morbid state of holding the League of Nations hostage in great detail. In the autumn of the year before last, Dr. Martin came to China at the invitation of various Chinese universities to give lectures, which were warmly welcomed by the audience. His sudden death is mourned by all who hear of it. (World News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>New Revolution Brewing in Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid's Atmosphere Grows Tense Again</p>
<p>The atmosphere here in Madrid has become tense again, and there are fears that disturbances will occur again soon. Since the general election last November, the Labor Party has been trying to unite the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and various industrial revolutionary factions to form a general front. Some have already been established in Catalonia and other places. Within the past week, several towns have announced general strikes. Except for bakeries and water and electricity plants, all work has been stopped, causing great inconvenience to the people. Recently, the number of unemployed people has continued to increase, and the activities of the revolutionary party have become more excited. Spain does not have a system of subsidizing the unemployed, so the unemployed and their families have no way to support themselves. It is said that thousands of households are crying out for food, which is extremely difficult. Many leaders of the Socialist Party, including several who have served as cabinet members, have joined the Labor Party. The failure of the Socialist Party in the general election last November was caused by the anxiety of the bourgeoisie and the middle class. The right-wing parties in Catalonia are now organizing informal defense corps to resist the violence of the industrial revolutionary faction. The government announced today that the authorities have made preparations to deal with all contingencies, but the cabinet is also facing many problems. Although the cabinet relies entirely on the support of the right wing, because the right wing is suspected of wanting to restore the monarchy, it has no representatives in the cabinet. For this reason, all urgently needed reforms have been stalled, and the right-wing members are also dissatisfied. A cabinet reshuffle to accommodate right-wing representatives seems inevitable, but once implemented, an explosion is to be feared. The Socialist Party issued a threat after the general election last November, saying that the real revolution had not yet arrived. This statement is still remembered today.

<h3>Anglo-French Trade War Unavoidable</h3>
<p>British Notice Expires on the 9th</p>
<p>France Still Shows No Sign of Changing Its Attitude</p>
<p>(London) Neither Britain nor France is willing to change its position. The trade war between the two countries is now closer than before. This was made clear in the British House of Commons today. Minister of Commerce Runciman stated in the House of Commons that there are currently no negotiations with France to conclude a new trade agreement. The British government does not want to negotiate on an unequal basis that discriminates against Britain. The British government is willing to strictly abide by the ten-day notice sent to France asking it to correct the discriminatory quota measures against Britain, partly because this declaration was issued before Daladier took office. If France takes no action to change its attitude during this period, Britain will take retaliatory measures to crack down on certain French goods. The British notice expires on February 9, but France has not yet shown any sign of changing its position, so negotiations are difficult to proceed. Although France has put forward several points for the British government to pay attention to, such as increasing the 1933 quota for certain British imports, France has not changed its attitude of reducing the British cloth import quota by 25%. At the beginning of this year, France reduced the import quota of British goods by 75%, which caused great indignation in Britain, which strongly protested against it. France then partially restored it, but Britain was still dissatisfied, because France had restored the original quota for the United States and other European countries, but not for Britain alone.

<h3>Japanese House of Peers Questions Policy Toward Manchuria</h3>
<p>The "Trinity" System Will Be Changed at the Appropriate Time</p>
<p>It Is Not Yet Time to End Military Operations</p>
<p>- Responses from the Foreign Minister and the Minister of War -</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Governor-General of Taiwan and member of the House of Peers, Eisuke Ishizuka, questioned the government's policy toward Manchuria this afternoon. The contents are as follows: (1) What is the government's fundamental policy toward Manchukuo? (2) The current situation, where the Commander of the Kwantung Army holds three positions concurrently, is no longer appropriate. Puyi has decided to become emperor on March 1, and the government should also adopt a policy of prioritizing military affairs and taking a civil administration policy. (3) It is rumored that after the Manchurian Incident, the military department advocated that internal policy must be reformed before going abroad and has drafted an internal reform plan. Is this a fact? (4) Regarding the issue of reforming the South Manchuria Railway, does the government have a finalized plan? Minister of War Hayashi said that the army has not drafted an internal reform plan and that it is not yet time to end military operations in Manchuria as soon as possible. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that the "Trinity" system will be changed at the appropriate time in the future. (China United Press dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Authorities Deny Sino-American Aviation Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Makes Reckless Speculation in Parliament</p>
<p>U.S. Private Companies Simultaneously Issue Statements to Refute Rumors</p>
<p>(Washington) Rumors that China and the United States had entered into a secret agreement to expand the Sino-American aviation business of the China National Aviation Corporation were ridiculed in official circles today as unfounded. This news was announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota in the Japanese House of Peers. He also said that the territorial integrity treaty of China has been violated by the China National Aviation Corporation, and that this secret agreement is quite important for military operations. (National News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(New York) Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota delivered a speech to the House of Peers today, saying that he strongly suspects that there is a secret agreement between the United States and China to develop Chinese aviation. Private American aviation companies, which jointly operate air transportation with the Chinese government, issued a statement after hearing Hirota's speech, saying, "The secret agreement mentioned by Hirota is indeed a secret, because we Americans have never heard of it." Representatives of these companies also said that the U.S. government has never participated in the contracts signed between the private companies and the Chinese government. According to the representatives, the reason why Japan feels uneasy is only because some American aviators who do not belong to the government voluntarily train Chinese flight personnel and are representatives of American aircraft manufacturers. In addition, the State Department also denied the Sino-American aviation secret agreement mentioned by Hirota. (Havas dispatch from the 6th)</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing Arrives in Tianjin Yesterday</h3>
<p>People of Tianjin Give a Warm Welcome</p>
<p>Yan Says There Is a Way Out in Diplomacy</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4:35 PM on the 7th, Ambassador to Russia Yan Huiqing arrived in Tianjin from Beijing. The train stopped at the new station for half an hour. The Provincial Government sent the Public Security Bureau Security Team to guard the station. Yu Xuezhong and members of the Provincial Committee boarded the train to welcome him. Dozens of Yan's old friends, Zhang Zhitian, Ni Daolang, etc., also boarded the train to meet him. Before the train left, Yan and Yu spoke with members of the Provincial Committee about his going to Russia nine months ago, actually traveling between Moscow and Geneva, and once going to Siberia in between. He lived in Russia for only six months. Because the delegation occupied the embassy, he worked out of hotels, spending many months living in hotels. Later, the embassy was vacated for repairs, which took another three months. The embassy's furniture was purchased from England, Germany, and within the country, and it took time to transport it. He had only just finished arranging it and moved in to work a few days before returning to the country. The upper floor of the embassy is for dormitories, and the lower floor is for public halls, almost like a large family. Russia can be said to be an ice-covered area. A few months ago, it had already reached minus 25 degrees Celsius, which is extremely cold. Before leaving the station, Yu and the Provincial Committee got off the train. At 5:05 PM, the train arrived at the east station. The Tianjin banking community, the business community,</p>
<p>The Nankai Alumni Association and students with flags welcomed him at the station. There were many people. Yan's two daughters jumped onto the train to see their father first. After Yan got off the train, he took his daughters in a car back to his private residence in Tianjin. The Tianjin reporter group boarded the train at the new station to visit Yan and followed him to the east station. On the train, Yan said that he had already given a talk to the press in Shanghai and Beijing, and had basically said what he wanted to say. He came to Tianjin to take care of personal matters and would go to Beiping in a few days, planning to stay at home for half a month, and then go to Beijing. He said that it was difficult to make a judgment about the poor relations between Japan and Russia, but the Europeans were extremely afraid of war and were trying to avoid it. Whether they could avoid it was another matter. We also hope that the relations between Japan and Russia will not break down and that they can settle things peacefully, which is human happiness. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan seems to be effective on the surface. It must be known that a country organized with an ideology is definitely stronger than one organized without an ideology. The treaty signed by Jin Shuren and Russia is naturally invalid because it has not been approved by the central government. He learned about this matter in the newspapers and has not yet received details after returning home. The saying that there is a way out in diplomacy is a personal research experience and cannot be exhausted in one sentence. He will announce it later. (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>

<h3>Inner Mongolia Representatives Stay in Beijing</h3>
<p>To Await Central Government's Inquiry</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nima Otesuerun, the representative of Inner Mongolia, said that the Central Government has drafted new Inner Mongolia Autonomy Measures separately, and the representatives have decided to stay in Beijing to await the Central Government's inquiry. They have also made two points to the Central Government a few days ago: (1) Since the autonomy measures decided by the Central Political Conference last month are difficult for the representatives to accept, the Central Government must not base the new measures on the previous measures. (2) Since attending the Central Political Conference is not permitted by law, the Central Government should, when drafting the autonomy measures, base them on the eleven items decided at Bailingmiao, and please consult with the representatives before submitting them to the Central Political Conference for discussion.

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Arrives in Beijing Yesterday</h3>

Now, because the duties of the Military Academy are heavy and it is inconvenient to leave for a long time, he immediately requested approval from the Commander-in-Chief to relinquish his military post and return to the school to oversee affairs. As for defending the country and suppressing the rebellion, it is the duty of soldiers and is not worth mentioning. He sincerely hopes that the country will be stable in the future so that national strength can be enriched, united to resist aggression, and to wipe away the great shame of the nation.

<h3>The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Concludes Agreement with Hong Kong Government</h3>
<p>Hong Kong to Establish Aviation Station</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong-Hong Kong-Philippines Route Completed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Aviation circles report that the joint Shanghai-Guangdong-Hong Kong air transport has not yet been realized due to various obstacles. If it can be realized, the Sino-British-American air route will be unimpeded. The American Far East Company is also planning a route from Hong Kong to Hanoi, which will be connected to the British Imperial Airways in the future. As for the Shanghai-Guangdong-Hong Kong-Philippines route, Mr. Bi Shi Bi, a technician from the China National Aviation Corporation, went south to negotiate with the Hong Kong government and has successfully added Hong Kong as an aviation station. Since the China National Aviation Corporation opened the Shanghai-Guangdong civil aviation route, passengers and merchants traveling to and from Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou have found it convenient. At that time, the company originally planned to establish an aviation station in Hong Kong, but it did not obtain the consent of the Hong Kong government at that time, so it first established the Shanghai-Guangdong route. In order to expedite the Hong Kong government's participation, the China National Aviation Corporation sent Mr. Bi Shi Bi south from Shanghai again to negotiate with the Hong Kong government several times. Now, after the two parties have exchanged opinions, they are very satisfied. After the draft treaty is finalized, Mr. Bi will return to Shanghai to report to the head office, and the formal signing will be carried out immediately. The Shanghai-Guangdong-Hong Kong and Manila routes can then be connected. (7th dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Current Situation of Japanese Immigration and Rural Decline</h3>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The most vigorous aspect of Japanese aggression in the Northeast today is the issue of immigration. Before the September 18th Incident, the number of Japanese who came to the Northeast was no more than 200,000, most of whom were employees of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) and consulates. Japan's excuse of so-called overpopulation for immigration is merely a cover for international perception. After the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, in order to seize markets and sources of raw materials, the Japanese implemented their immigration policy with the mission of aggression. The Japanese Army Department, the Colonial Affairs Ministry, the Governor-General of Korea, and the SMR spent 100,000 yuan on investigation fees and organized the "Manchuria-Mongolia Immigration Investigation Committee." The Colonial Affairs Ministry also established the "Manchuria-Mongolia Immigration Bureau" to specialize in planning and implementing immigration. Since then, so-called "industrial immigrants," "fishing immigrants," "gold mining immigrants," and "armed group immigrants" have come in a steady stream. The number of Koreans crossing the river to the west is countless. It is difficult to count the numbers in remote areas. In major cities, Shenyang currently has more than 36,000 Japanese residents, an increase of 60% compared to before the incident. Harbin has about 8,000 Japanese residents, an increase of 45%. As for Changchun, the so-called "New Capital," it has about 4,400 Japanese residents, an increase of more than 27 times. This alarming rate of increase is only accelerating.</p>
<p>The Northeast's commerce has also undergone significant changes compared to the past. The Japanese monopoly on goods has reached perfection. European and American goods that were popular in the Northeast market in the past have disappeared today. Even Chinese products have suffered a fatal blow. For example, before the September 18th Incident, the Northeast market for porcelain was able to be self-sufficient with domestic products due to the protection of a high tax rate of 40%. Starting in July of last year (1933), the tariff rate was changed to 15% ad valorem according to the will of the Japanese. As a result, Nagoya porcelain products from Japan, which had once disappeared from the Northeast market, became very active and had the potential to dominate the Northeast market. Chinese products have since fallen into decline. Other examples include French silk fabrics, which have been overwhelmed by Japanese rayon, and German industrial machinery and pharmaceuticals, which have also been gradually eroded by Japanese goods. Therefore, the goods used in the Northeast today have almost become a Japanese monopoly. If one travels to major cities, one might as well be in a Japanese street. What one sees are Japanese people, and what one buys are Japanese goods. Advertisements for Japanese products are everywhere. The changes are lamentable. Last year, the Northeast had an unprecedented bumper harvest of soybeans, sorghum, corn, and other special products. The output was the highest in recent years. However, the result was not only not the "Manchurian development boom" as the Japanese claimed, but also a sharp drop in prices. It is expected that after the new soybeans appear, their prices will fall to half of what they were in previous years. The lives of farmers have been greatly affected, and bankruptcies are common, resulting in a so-called "famine in a year of plenty." The sharpness of the worldwide panic is one of the main reasons, but the following reasons are also responsible for this: (1) The most important special product of the bumper harvest is soybeans, and Germany, the consumer of soybeans and its products, has increased tariff barriers; (2) The puppet Central Bank has stopped purchasing special products; (3) The financial stagnation caused by the contraction of the puppet country's currency. The above reasons have caused the decrease in the export of special products and the tragic fall in prices, which in turn have led to a violent panic in the Northeast economy and have changed the Northeast's historically surplus trade into a deficit. The comparison with even the lower year of 1932 compared to last year is shocking. Here is a statistical excerpt:</p>
<h3>Trade Volume in 1932 and 1933 (January to October) (Unit: 1,000 Yen)</h3>
<p>|               | 1932      | 1933      | Actual Increase/Decrease | Same Rate % |</p>
<p>| ------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |</p>
<p>| Exports       | 248,327   | 278,999   | Increase 30,672          | 12.3        |</p>
<p>| Imports       | 157,359   | 296,302   | Increase 138,943         | 88.2        |</p>
<p>| Total         | 405,686   | 575,301   | Increase 169,615         | 41.8        |</p>
<p>| Trade Balance | Surplus 90,968 | Deficit 17,303 | — | — |</p>
<p>The 1933 export item in the above table increased compared to 1932, but the speed of the increase was far less than that of imports, resulting in an unprecedented and terrible fact - a deficit. From another perspective, this deficit means that the bankruptcy of rural areas has accelerated. The puppet country authorities are therefore extremely anxious and embarrassed. In order to rescue rural areas on the verge of bankruptcy, they had no choice but to raise and lend 1,000 country yuan in "rural relief funds." Endo, the director of the puppet general affairs department, also announced the following countermeasures on December 30 of last year: (1) Adopt appropriate digestion methods to prevent this year's soybeans from being oversupplied; (2) Prevent price declines caused by farmers' eagerness to sell their products; (3) Reduce sales commissions, storage fees, railway freight, etc. to increase farmers' actual income. Based on the three major principles mentioned above, the following specific measures will be implemented by the agencies under the jurisdiction of the puppet Ministry of Industry, the puppet Ministry of Finance, and the puppet Ministry of Communications: (1) Under the subsidy of the puppet government, joint storage agencies will be established in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and the puppet Central Bank will expand the scope of financial accommodation for the storage of special products; (2) In addition to existing agencies, appropriate agencies will be established to guide the sale of special products; (3) Induce the complete elimination of a large amount of accumulated special products. While the puppet government authorities are providing relief to the Northeast rural villages on the verge of bankruptcy, in order to thoroughly eradicate the cause - the oversupply of special products - they are establishing so-called "joint sales associations" in Heilongjiang and other places. There is also a "Manchuria Special Products Central Company," which is intended to bring together all Manchurian producers, exporters, and shipping companies, which is also in the planning stages. According to the investigation, the content of this organization is attached below to show a glimpse. The "Special Product Loan Management Committee" of the same nature takes the provincial governor as the chairman. In addition to monitoring the joint sales association mentioned above, its duties include guiding the sale of soybeans and having international transportation companies be responsible for export and storage.</p>
<p>The joint sales association's measures are as follows: (1) Location and number: main distribution areas in northern Manchuria, namely 24 in Heilongjiang Province and several in Jilin Province; (2) Organization: Farmers within a certain area who need to entrust the storage and sale of soybeans must be members and must set up a chairman and representatives of the entrustors to handle association affairs; (3) Establishment fee: subsidized by the puppet government; (4) Business: According to the loan measures, accept the entrustment of the entrustor (borrower) and, with the consent of the entrustor, manage the following matters, namely joint storage, guarantee issuance, and joint sale of soybeans; (5) Calculation: The income and profit and loss of the sale of soybeans are shared jointly by all members according to the quantity of soybeans entrusted for storage; (6) Lending agency: Manchuria puppet Central Bank; (7) Loan amount: Farmers who have not yet received sufficient spring plowing loans can be granted an amount equal to 90% of the current price of soybeans within the total amount of principal and interest of the spring plowing loan, but half of the soybean loan must be paid into the puppet Central Bank as principal and interest repayment for the spring plowing loan; other farmers can be granted an amount equal to 70% of the current price; (8) Period: The maximum loan period shall not exceed three months, and if it is unavoidable, another proof may be established; (9) Interest: 7% per month.

<h3>A Calamity for the Tianjin Business Community</h3>
<p>Match Factories Unable to Sustain Themselves</p>
<p>Spinning Mills Plan to Cease Operations</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Last year, Tianjin, affected by the war, experienced instability and unrest in all aspects of society. In particular, the business community, with the blockade of the Hebei region, was unable to transport goods from the Northeast for sale. Consequently, the economic downturn was more severe than usual. Last year, the Ministry of Finance also issued new unified tax regulations, dealing another heavy blow to the business community, which had barely recovered. Since December, the match industry in Tianjin has been unstable, and now the fate of match merchants is hanging by a thread. It is known that there are only three match companies in Tianjin: Danhua, Beiyang, and Rongchang. Danhua has a capital of 1.7 million, Beiyang is divided into two factories, North and South, with a total capital of less than 300,000. Although Rongchang's capital is less than Danhua's, it is twice as large as Beiyang's. Normally, sales are influenced by dumping from the neighboring Shandong province. After the fall of the Northeast, sales in the war zone were also impossible. Most of the market share was taken by Japanese goods. Only southern Hebei and northern Henan can be relied on for support. With the increase in new taxes, the companies were not informed in advance, and the inventory could not be released to the market. Each company has an inventory of three to four thousand cases. In mid-December, they requested the Hebei Provincial Government and the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the central Ministry of Finance for (1) exemption from the new unified tax and (2) permission to pay the old tax for the inventory of each factory before the issuance of the new unified tax order on December 5. However, repeated appeals were ineffective. The branch offices once expressed their intention to strike in protest, but were dissuaded by party and government agencies. From the beginning of December to late January, the factories agreed to pay the new tax, but due to sluggish sales, Danhua's inventory was 17,000 cases, Rongchang's 15,000 cases, and Beiyang's 11,000 cases, tying up a considerable amount of capital. Beiyang, with its weaker financial resources and the death of its general manager, lacked someone in charge, which led to financial difficulties. It first declared its inability to maintain operations. Half a month ago, the South factory stopped work. Later, due to the appeal of more than three hundred unemployed workers to party and government agencies for relief, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Committee reluctantly persuaded the factory to resume work. One party agreed to borrow 500,000 from the bank on behalf of the company. The three companies guaranteed the loan with their assets, and the funds were used to maintain operations. Beiyang South factory immediately resumed work. Just over ten days later, the party and government agencies failed to provide the promised loan. The company was forced to close down again the other day. The North factory has reduced its machinery and is temporarily struggling to survive. Although the party and government agencies know that this matter will have a great impact on the market, they are powerless to help and can only listen to it. Currently, the two agencies are negotiating the terms of dismissal with labor and management. The workers are demanding a month's wages as severance pay and travel expenses to return home. The company is still unwilling to agree, and the party and government agencies are trying their best to persuade them. Rongchang Company, amid the financial distress of Beiyang, struggled to support itself for a month. The other day, it also announced that its inventory was full and its working capital was exhausted. It submitted a report to the Municipal Government for permission to suspend work for a month from December 25th of the lunar calendar to sell its goods. If the inventory is sold out, it will continue to operate. Otherwise, it will shut down. The Party Bureau, believing that the financial distress of Beiyang alone was enough to shake the market, and that the failure of Rongchang would lead to more unemployment and increase social unrest, invited the manager of the company and representatives of the workers to the Municipal Government. The party and municipal agencies tried their best to persuade them. As a result, the workers' representatives agreed to work together with the company to overcome this difficulty. If wages cannot be paid in full, they can be reduced by a certain percentage, and then supplemented after the inventory is sold out. Rongchang, with no other option, agreed to comply. Danhua, with more available capital, is still able to maintain operations. It has not made any statement during the panic of Rongchang and Beiyang.</p>
<p>The crisis of the Tianjin match industry has been described above. The spinning industry is also in a precarious state. There are six companies in Tianjin: Huaxin, Hengyuan, Beiyang, Yuda, Baocheng, and Yuyuan. Yuda, established by the Japanese, has the most capital and its sales are uniquely broad due to raw materials. The other five companies are run by Chinese merchants. In the past, the sales of each company depended on exports to the Northeast. Last year, only Yuda, a Japanese yarn factory, could export to the Northeast. Hengyuan and Huaxin, along with the other five companies, were hindered by the high tariffs of the puppet regime. The sales of the five companies could only be promoted in the four provinces of Henan, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. As a result, sales were generally sluggish. Last year, Hengyuan and Beiyang, due to their weak financial resources, repeatedly threatened to collapse. They were only maintained with the utmost persuasion from party and government agencies. Recently, Hengyuan and Beiyang have reached the point of exhaustion and are unable to continue. They secretly sent people to report to the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau, planning to suspend operations within the lunar year. The two factories employ more than five thousand workers. If they close down, it will not only affect the market, but also make Huaxin and Yuyuan unable to maintain operations and successively declare bankruptcy. Therefore, the Municipal Government, in coordination with the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau, summoned the managers of the two factories and urged them to maintain operations, taking the overall situation into consideration. The party and government agencies will try their best to find ways to coordinate loans with the banking community to get through the lunar New Year. The managers of the two factories, after being so earnestly advised by the authorities and promising relief, abandoned their plans to declare bankruptcy. However, with an inventory of more than two thousand pieces each, they plan to reduce the night shift after the lunar New Year to sell off accumulated goods. The party and government agencies, recognizing that this is a real situation, have allowed it. Therefore, the crisis of Beiyang and Hengyuan has been temporarily alleviated. The spinning and match industries are the main industries in Tianjin. Now that they are declining so drastically, it is also a misfortune for the economic business community of North China. (5th)</p>
<h3>The Tibetan Situation After the Passing of the Dalai Lama</h3>
<p>Internally Divided into Three Factions</p>
<p>Two Dalai Lamas Already Born in Eastern Tibet</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, a dispatch from Tachienlu on December 28th of last year stated that the news of the passing of the Dalai Lama only reached Tachienlu and the surrounding areas a few days ago via a telegram from Nanjing. Lamas and Tibetans here are now afraid that the spread of this news in Tibet may cause unrest. The Dalai Lama passed away on December 17th, but Tachienlu only learned of it on the 22nd. The cause of the unrest will likely come from three sources: (1) those who sympathize with the Panchen Lama and wish to see him reinstated; (2) those who sympathize with the current monastic regime and wish to see the clergy continue to hold power; and (3) the youth faction in Lhasa, who desire a strong political organization to control Tibet. The power of the youth faction is now growing daily. They aspire to make Tibet occupy a more important position among the nations. The Tibetan Transport Office, currently occupying the right bank of the Yangtze River opposite Tai Erji, is organized by this faction. These educated youths dislike the rule of the lamas and wish to implement a new political system in Lhasa. When the lama leaders go to seek the fourteenth Dalai Lama in the future, it is feared that each faction will show its power. Two Dalai Lamas have already been born in Eastern Tibet, one from Guotang and one from Gangda. This election will have significant political implications. Currently, there are 7,700 lamas and Gelugpa monks in Trilingben, most of whom come from Eastern Tibet. These people are inclined towards China. Sera has 5,500 lamas, and Galdan has 3,300 lamas, all of whom hold a neutral attitude. Trashilhunpo has 4,000 lamas and Gelugpa monks, who fully support their religious leader, the Panchen Lama. The large lama temples in Eastern Tibet are all inclined towards China and wish to see the Panchen Lama reinstated.</p>
<h3>In the Midst of Shandong Party Affairs Disputes</h3>
<p>Zhang Weicun Resigns</p>
<p>Personal Integrity Not Trusted</p>
<p>Internal Strife Within the Association</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province party affairs have been in dispute for many days and have not been resolved. Zhang Weicun, a Standing Committee member of the Provincial Executive Committee, has been the target of criticism by party members. Yesterday (the 5th), he sent a special telegram to Beijing to sincerely request resignation from his positions as member of the Provincial Executive Committee, Standing Committee member, and Anti-Corruption Commissioner. He requested that Han Fuju preside over the affairs of the Provincial Party Headquarters and that Lin Mingjiu, the Captain of the Special Service Team, be responsible for anti-corruption affairs. He also requested the Central Government to send someone to take over as soon as possible. The telegram stated: "I, Weicun, have been responsible for Shandong party affairs for several years. I have received guidance from the Central Government, assistance from local military and government officials, and the joint efforts of comrades in various counties. All elections have been handled in an orderly manner, and party affairs throughout the province have been smoothly advanced. However, since the election of representatives to the Fifth National Congress, the opinions of the Provincial Committee members have varied, leading to mutual stimulation and escalation. Eventually, all arrows were aimed at Weicun alone. During the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, some comrades even fabricated false accusations and publicly attacked Weicun. The Central Government's attempts to stop it were ineffective, and the situation has become increasingly amplified. In recent years, Weicun has only known to follow the instructions of the Central Government, do his best in his duties, and stabilize the local area. He has not been concerned with praise or criticism, gain or loss. Moreover, in recent years, the country has experienced many misfortunes, and the situation in Shandong Province is special. Even if Weicun cannot help the current difficulties, he should not burden the overall situation. Unexpectedly, personal integrity has not been trusted, and internal strife has occurred within the association, causing the previously stable local situation and harmonious party affairs to suffer adverse impacts. After introspecting, I am filled with shame and fear. After returning to Shandong, I actively concluded the various party affairs and anti-corruption tasks I was responsible for. However, two or three comrades in Beijing have fabricated rumors and are trying to harm me. Comrades in various counties, because Weicun has always been subject to slander, have gathered in the provincial capital and are planning to make some expressions. Weicun is deeply afraid that those who are misled will mislead the party. Therefore, I specially request to resign from my positions as member of the Shandong Provincial Executive Committee, Standing Committee member, and Shandong Anti-Corruption Commissioner, etc. I respectfully request that you approve this to avoid the path of the wise and quell rumors. All internal affairs of the association, with the exception of Committee Member Jiang Bocheng, who is in Peiping, the remaining four committee members are out of office in Beijing. Only Permanent Committee Member Han (Fuju) of this association in Jinan is requested to preside over everything to avoid interruption of association affairs. Regarding anti-corruption affairs, Captain Lin Mingjiu of the Special Service Team is temporarily responsible for maintaining order. Please send someone from the Central Government to take over as soon as possible. As for the points of attack against Weicun, in terms of party discipline, I will collect counter-evidence, compile it, and submit it to the Central Government to await disposition. In terms of national law, I will follow legal procedures to seek resolution. I respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. Respectfully, Zhang Weicun, member of the Shandong Provincial Executive Committee, Standing Committee member, and Shandong Anti-Corruption Commissioner."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Compiles and Trains County Defense Corps</h3>

The implementation period is from May of the 23rd year. All required start-up costs and spring uniform costs are to be paid from the county's defense expenses, as decided by the 622nd meeting of the provincial government. In the future, after the establishment of the headquarters of each county's general team, district group deputy refresher training courses should be held to cultivate cadre talents. The soldiers are divided into three types: (1) Regular soldiers, with a service period of one year; (2) Reserve soldiers, with a service period of three years; (3) Rear reserve soldiers, with a service period of six years.

<h3>Killing a Cat Causes a Major Disaster</h3>
<p>In the Xingjiao Temple area of Tianzhuang Township, Benyi, there is a man named Gu Yuding, who has been teaching at the local Xingjiao Elementary School. His family is well-off and can live comfortably. The family kept a cat, which suddenly became wild the other day and snatched away two cured chickens from the house. Therefore, Yuding was extremely angry and thought of putting the cat to death. The next evening, he and his younger brother, Guiyu, waited for the cat to eat. They tied it up, poured kerosene all over its body, and set it on fire. After being set on fire, the cat cried out in pain, struggling desperately, so that the rope broke. It ran wildly and rushed into the firewood room. When Yuding and others saw this, they immediately tracked it down. Unexpectedly, in this dry weather, especially with firewood being prone to catching fire, the fire spread in an instant and could not be contained. They immediately rang the gong to warn the neighbors, but unfortunately, it was quite far from the town, and the village lacked fire-fighting equipment. It was too late to save the situation, so they let it spread. The neighbors were also affected. The fire was extinguished after burning for about three hours. It is estimated that more than 30 houses were destroyed, with losses of several thousand yuan.</p>

<h3>Last Year's City Population Statistics</h3>
<p>Over 3.3 Million People</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has achieved significant results since handling household registration investigations. The "January 28th Incident" in the previous year caused difficulties in household registration investigations in Shanghai due to various reasons. The bureau made great efforts to rectify the situation, and it has now become normal, with various investigation reports being submitted monthly.

The total population in the last month of the previous year was 339,585 households with 1,662,711 people. By the last month of last year, the number of households had increased to 377,332, and the population had increased to 1,846,178. The total population of the city is uncertain because it is impossible to carry out investigations in the special districts.

<p>Detailed Investigation by the International Trade Bureau</p>
<p>Complete Investigation Expected by Mid-Next Month</p>

<h3>The Pu An Steamer and a British Merchant Ship</h3>
<p>Collided in the Huangpu River Yesterday</p>
<p>The Bow of the Pu An Damaged</p>
<p>The Forecastle is Cracked and Flooded</p>
<p>The British Ship's Midships is also Damaged</p>
<p>Public Inspection Today</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Qingdao Class Steamer Pu An was robbed last time, and the case has not yet been solved. The steamer came to Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday and entered the Huangpu River. When it reached within the Wusong Estuary, it collided with the British merchant ship Philoctetes of the Blue Funnel Line. The bow of the Pu An was completely damaged, and the outer hull of the Blue Funnel Line's midships was also damaged. Both ships have berthed at the wharf and will be inspected by the impartial personnel requested by both parties today to determine the responsibility. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Pu An Arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao. The China Merchants Bureau's Pu An Steamer sailed from Qingdao to Shanghai, carrying many goods and passengers. Yesterday afternoon at 1 o'clock, the steamer arrived at Wusong and immediately entered the Huangpu River, preparing to dock at the Hua Zhan Wharf in Pudong to unload goods and passengers. Captain Rex, First Mate Sun Zuoren, and others were all on duty on the bridge, carefully navigating. At 1:05, the Pu An sailed in front of the Zhabei Power Plant when it suddenly collided with the Philoctetes, a giant steamer of the Blue Funnel Line, causing a major accident. Both ships were damaged.</p>
<p>Two Ships Collided in the Huangpu River. The British merchant ship Philoctetes of the Blue Funnel Line transported goods to Shanghai from Liverpool. After unloading a part of the goods in Shanghai, it was heading to Dalian, Japan, and other places yesterday afternoon. When it sailed to the river surface in front of the Zhabei Power Plant, it was close to the Pu An Steamer, and both should have given way. According to Mr. Zhao Yuntai, Director of the Shipping Department of the China Merchants Bureau, the Pu An and the British ship were trying to avoid each other, resulting in carelessness, which caused the hulls of the Pu An Steamer and the Philoctetes to suddenly come close to each other. Unable to avoid, a violent collision occurred.</p>
<p>Conditions of Injuries on Both Sides. During the collision, the bow of the Pu An Steamer and the outer hull of the left midships of the British ship Philoctetes collided violently. The captains of the two ships immediately reversed their engines. At this time, the left side of the bow of the Pu An Steamer was dented by the British ship, and the keel of the bow was also broken. At the waterline of the bow, the iron plate was broken and a large hole was torn, and the forecastle was flooded with water, causing significant damage. The outer iron plate of the midships on the left side of the British ship Philoctetes was also damaged. The degree of damage was slightly less than that of the Pu An because the midships was fully loaded with goods, so the damage was also not insignificant.</p>
<p>Personnel Dispatched to the Ship for Inspection. After the accident, the Pu An immediately sailed to Hua Zhan to berth, and the British ship also stopped exporting and sailed back to the Blue Funnel Wharf. Each dispatched crew members to report to the company. The China Merchants Bureau received the report at around 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Zhao Yuntai, Director of the Shipping Department, along with engineers Zhang Yao and Huang Zonglun, took a small steamer to Pudong to board the Pu An Steamer for inspection and inquired about the cause of the accident from Captain Rex. The damaged areas were verified and recorded by engineers Zhang and Huang. As for the collision situation, there is a relationship of responsibility, so it will be determined after the public inspection by the notary today. It is inconvenient to announce at this time.</p>
<p>Reported to the Shanghai Harbor Master. The China Merchants Bureau has reported this matter to the Customs Harbor Master, and the Blue Funnel Line has also reported to the Shanghai Taipan by its shipowner and submitted it to the Harbor Master for inspection. The passengers of the Pu An, which came to Shanghai from Qingdao, immediately went ashore as scheduled and were sent to the new customs wharf by a small steamer to disembark. The cargo inside the ship was unloaded as usual. Zhao Yuntai, Director of the Shipping Department, and engineers Zhang and Huang, who inspected the ship, returned to the bureau at 6 o'clock in the evening and reported to General Manager Liu that night.</p>
<p>Public Inspection Together Today. Regarding the responsibility for the collision between the two ships, as well as the degree of damage and the losses of both parties, the China Merchants Bureau and the Blue Funnel Line have reported to the marine insurance companies and will jointly hire impartial personnel to inspect the two ships today, and inquire about the sailing conditions of the two shipowners and how the collision occurred, so that the impartial personnel can determine the responsibility.</p>
<p>Pu An's Earlier Suspension for Repair. According to Director Zhao, the Pu An Steamer was originally planned to be suspended for repairs during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday because the furnace needed to be repaired. Now that the collision has occurred, the steamer must be suspended earlier and towed into the dock for repairs after the impartial person verifies it today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Harbor Sees Hungarian Ship for the First Time</h3>
<p>First Time Since Trading with European Countries</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Newspaper, yesterday marked the first time since China began trading with European countries that a Hungarian ship, the Oriental, entered Shanghai Harbor. The ship was originally the British ship Tetriqitan, with a net tonnage of 2,722 tons and a displacement of 8,000 tons. It was purchased by its current owners a year ago. Although it is registered in the Hungarian capital, it cannot sail there because its size prevents it from entering the Danube River. Except for the seven Arab stokers, all the crew members are Hungarian. This time, it set sail from the Port of Sulina in Romania on the Black Sea with 7,500 tons of wheat, passing through Columbus and Singapore, and arriving in Shanghai after a voyage of 55 days. It is currently berthed at the China Merchants Bureau East Wharf and is unloading goods. It will stay in Shanghai for at least ten days before sailing to Dalian, where it will load soybeans. According to the ship's First Mate Inno, there are a total of five Hungarian sea ships. The Abata sank in the Indian Ocean a month ago, and only four remain. After the European War, two-thirds of Hungary's land was divided among other countries and newly formed countries according to treaties. Its only seaport, Fiume, was also lost. Therefore, although the ships fly the Hungarian flag, they cannot meet with their motherland.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, the sales of Japanese cotton textiles, cotton cloth, and other items in this port have suddenly slumped since the outbreak of the Fujian issue, with financial bottlenecks in various places. Foreign firms have turned to explore overseas markets. It is now approaching the Lunar New Year season, which has always been very prosperous in the past, but it is still the same. Therefore, they have to sell to India, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Arabia, and Rangoon. However, due to exchange rate relations, goods from Japan are relatively cheap, so all parties are hesitant.</p>
<h3>Former Secretary of the Xinjiang Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Zhong Ying Talks About the Reasons for the Rebellion in Southern Xinjiang</p>
<p>It is Not Easy to Use Troops There</p>
<p>The Future Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the news of the independence of Southern Xinjiang has been confirmed by all parties. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specifically visited Mr. Zhong Ying, former secretary of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, to inquire about the details. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Rebellion. According to Mr. Zhong, he has been away from the south for a long time, so the recent situation is extremely isolated. However, in the past, the Han Chinese of Kashi were absolutely obedient to the orders of the provincial government, so they were at peace. There are very few Han Chinese in the area, and the Han Chinese all believe in Islam, so they are all Muslims. However, most of these religious people are engaged in business. In addition, there are the Kirgiz, who are also a type of Han Chinese. On the border of Afghanistan and Soviet Russia, there is another tribe that is usually the same as the Mongols, accustomed to nomadic life, and more hardy. Therefore, during this rebellion, there were Kirgiz soldiers who once occupied the Han city and carried out massacres before withdrawing. The reason is unclear, but it is suspected that the reason for this rebellion is that they took advantage of the fact that Xin's chaos could not be taken care of, and took the opportunity to change.</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Use Troops. However, if troops are used, the most difficult thing is the matter of supplies. Kashi is very far from the provincial capital, and the transportation is very inconvenient. If you travel by horse-drawn carriage, it will take a month to arrive. There are two routes from Dihua to Shufu, one via Dihua to Kuqa and the other via Dihua to Turpan, separated by the Tarim Basin (i.e., the Great Gobi). The area is a desert and cannot be used for military operations. Taking a detour, the journey is long and difficult. Therefore, although this incident is very simple in fact, it cannot be viewed vaguely. What is to be feared is that its actions may have a background, and the authorities have the difficulty of being beyond their reach. The only important thing at present is to hope that the central government has a quick solution, then the suppression will be easier. Otherwise, the longer the night, the more dreams there will be, and the future cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3>Increase in Kerosene Tariff</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Cables a Request for Postponement</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday, (omitting the title) that on the 6th of this month, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce's branch telegram opened, reporting that the Ministry of Finance instructed the Chief Inspector of Customs to open a brief statement: "The current import tax on kerosene (including other mineral oils for lighting) is levied at 0.1137 gold units per unit, and the tax on gasoline (including various unnamed engine fuels) is levied at 0.47 customs gold per unit, which will be implemented from February 1st, 23rd year," etc. It is verified that kerosene is a necessity for the daily use of ordinary people, and gasoline is the motive power of machines, and is especially important for the lifeline of industry and transportation. Taking Su La oil as an example, the original price was 70 yuan per ton, but it soared to 50 yuan in just a few days. At this time, when the social economy is becoming increasingly bankrupt, the impact on the daily use of ordinary people is not small. According to legislative procedures, increasing the tax rate must be approved by the Legislative Yuan to take care of people's livelihood and show caution. Now, according to the requests for relief from the wheel boat, water pumping, and rice milling machinery industries in our county, we have always known that your association leads the merchants, and the whole country admires it. In addition to telegraphing the central government to order the Ministry of Finance to withdraw the order, we also ask for consistent advocacy. At the same time, according to the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Industry Association's branch telegram, it is briefly stated that members have recently come to the association to say that the engines installed on the bureau's steamboats are all suitable for thin juice diesel as fuel. Eight years ago, the price was only more than 40 yuan per ton, and it has gradually increased over the years to 74 yuan and 30 cents. Unexpectedly, recently, the Ministry of Finance believes that this thin juice diesel can be refined into kerosene for lighting, and the tariff is increased by 26.30 gold units per ton, which is about 50 yuan in national currency. The previously established kerosene refining management regulations stipulating that imported diesel must be guaranteed by merchants to be used for refining kerosene were abolished, so that the Mobil and other companies also skyrocketed the price of this oil by 50 yuan per ton. In this way, the necessary supplies used by the bureau's steamboats are suddenly taxed by the Ministry of Finance to 70% of the original price, creating a new precedent for heavy taxes. In name, it increases the import tax on foreign merchants, but in reality, it absorbs our people's fat and blood. The bureau's steamboat merchants are unable to bear this unreasonable heavy tax, and have sent a special letter requesting that you quickly transfer the matter to the City Chamber of Commerce to petition the government to immediately cancel it for relief, etc. Based on this, it is verified that the above-mentioned sections are all true. The inland river boat industry is in a precarious situation. I念that our government authorities should vigorously maintain the Three People's Principles. According to the previous situation, we dare to appeal to your association to ask for orders for the merchants and to telegraph the Ministry of Finance, that for this case, it should be treated reasonably and exempt from being included in the crude oil for refining, so as to avoid the extra heavy taxes that航商should not bear. Etc. to the association. Based on this, it is verified that a separate standard for classifying and taxing imported diesel and kerosene has been approved by the Jianghai Customs and forwarded for announcement. The Inland River Steamboat Industry Association immediately based its voice on this announcement, and the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce still bases itself on the sections reported in the newspaper. Although the basis is different, the purpose of the request is the same. Now, because of the tax increase, the price will rise accordingly, and the impact on industry and people's livelihood is not small. It is reasonable to report the situation and ask your ministry to review it and give an order to postpone the implementation of the tax increase agreement to show leniency. In anticipation of the imminent telegram, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows. Fish seal.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Orders Subordinates</h3>
<p>Do Not Illegally Detain Suspects</p>
<p>Turn Over to the Courts Within Two Hours</p>
<p>Violators Will Be Treated as Unauthorized Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wen Hong'en, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, due to frequent illegal detentions of suspects by his subordinates, has specifically stipulated that all suspects must be handed over to the detention center for custody within two hours. The following is a record of his instructions: It is hereby ordered that all subordinate units must comply. Upon investigation, it has been found that various departments under this bureau, when handling cases and arresting suspects, often delay in handing them over to the courts for interrogation, resulting in an unclear accumulation of prisoners in the detention center, as well as deaths due to illegal detention of suspects. Human rights are at stake, and the reputation of the police is at stake. Although the bureau has issued transfer slips to save time in transferring cases, delays still occur, which is highly inappropriate. In the future, all units must adhere to Article 1 of the Supplementary Regulations of the Detective Team and hand over suspects to the courts for interrogation within three hours of their arrest. Delays are not allowed. Furthermore, when various departments request the interrogation of suspects, they must notify the Third Section beforehand, unless they have a handwritten order from the bureau director, in order to comply with procedures and avoid confusion. In addition to separate orders, Article 1 of the Supplementary Regulations of the Detective Team is hereby copied and issued for compliance. This order is issued on February 5th, the 23rd year of the Republic of China by Bureau Director Wen Hong'en. Attached is Article 1 of the Supplementary Regulations of the Detective Team: If the detective team arrests any suspects while handling cases under orders, they shall be handed over to the detention center for custody within two hours and a written statement of the case shall be sent to the Third Section for review. A report shall also be submitted to the bureau director. The deadline shall not exceed three hours. Violators will be treated as unauthorized imprisonment.</p>
<h3>External Telegram Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>German Egg Tax Has Been Ordered to Be Negotiated</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward a telegram to the Chinese Embassy in Germany to strongly advocate against the heavy tax imposed by Germany on Chinese eggs, which was heavier than that of other countries. This has been reported previously. It is now learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, the original text of which is recorded below: Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Your urgent telegram regarding the German increase in egg tax has been received. There are currently no plans to revise the Sino-German Customs Treaty. Clause 2 of Article 1 of the original treaty states that neither contracting party may impose higher or different customs duties on the people of the other country, which is sufficient as the basis for negotiations in this case. This Ministry has previously telegraphed the Chinese Embassy in Germany, instructing them to negotiate with the German government to reduce the tax rate on Chinese eggs. According to the previous telegram, in addition to instructing the embassy to continue negotiations and awaiting their report to the Ministry, we hereby inform you for your information. Jiang Yin, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>The Gansu Flood Is Extremely Severe</h3>
<p>Over Forty Counties Affected, with Disaster Victims Eagerly Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>The Gansu Provincial Government Requests the Relief Association to Quickly Allocate Relief Funds for Rescue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association for Raising Funds for the Yellow River Flood Disaster received an official letter from the Gansu Provincial Government yesterday, stating: Regarding the previous receipt of your two telegrams stating that the current relief funds have been fully distributed and that we will find ways to raise more funds and remit them as soon as possible, etc. Upon receiving this, we immediately informed the Gansu Provincial Relief Committee and the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments. It is now reported by Gao Wenwei, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Relief Committee, stating that the Gansu flood this year is extremely severe, affecting more than forty counties, and the disaster victims awaiting relief are in dire straits. This committee has repeatedly requested your office for prompt emergency relief and has detailed the disaster situation and relief measures, earnestly requesting approval and transfer for relief to save the people. The weather is already severely cold, and no relief funds have been allocated from the central government or other parties. Telegrams requesting relief from various counties are pouring in, and this committee is short of funds and is extremely anxious. It is heard that the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association for Raising Funds for the Yellow River Flood Disaster is very concerned about the disaster situation in various provinces. In addition to instructing representatives stationed in Beijing, Guo Zifan and Tian Yunqing, to appeal to the association, we have prepared a survey table of water disasters in various counties, along with several disaster photos, and submitted them to your office for review, telegraphing the association to request relief for the Gansu disaster, and requesting you to separately telegraph the authorities to urge urgent relief to save the survivors. We sincerely pray, etc., and we have sent a survey table of each county and a photo album of the disaster situation in each county to your office. In addition to instructing and separately telegraphing for the quick allocation of emergency relief, we are sending the original attachments for your review. We hope that you will have compassion on the disaster victims and quickly allocate a large amount of relief funds for rescue, and we hope to receive a reply.</p>

<h3>Chinese Cotton Mills Are Unlikely to Be Optimistic This Year</h3>
<p>Revitalizing Rural Areas Is the Fundamental Solution</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Dumping Deals a Heavy Blow to Us</p>
<p>According to news from the cotton yarn industry, the production and sales situation of yarn mills in various regions last year has been distributed in the form of a survey table by the National Federation of Chinese Cotton Mills, but it has not yet been collected. However, based on the general situation, although the resistance of Shanghai's yarn mills is stronger, Japanese merchants are actively expanding and competing, which will deal a heavy blow to us. The situation this year is still unlikely to be optimistic. The following is a record of what they said:</p>
<p>Few Factories Made Profits Last Year According to the discussion, the federation conducts surveys of production and sales in various regions every year in order to audit the situation of the national yarn industry within a year. Various survey tables have now been issued, but some factories still adhere to conventions and settle accounts at the end of the old lunar year, so the summary table has not yet been collected and calculated. However, based on the general situation, very few factories were able to make profits last year. High cotton prices, low yarn prices, dumping of foreign goods, and social unrest in various regions have all dealt a heavy blow to yarn mills. The factories in Shanghai have stronger resistance, so they can still maintain operations. Those in Tianjin, Hankou, and Qingdao have even suspended work due to excessive inventory.</p>
<p>Relief of Yarn Prices Can Only Treat the Symptoms Although yarn prices have risen recently, by about four yuan per bale, cotton prices have also risen, by five yuan per dan. Therefore, calculated by cost, the price increase still results in losses. Moreover, since the September 18th Incident of the year before last, wars have continued in various parts of the country, the market has been depressed, and commerce has stagnated, which has had a huge impact.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants' Steps to Invade Me The most powerful foreign competitor is Japan. Its plan this year is to add factories in Qingdao and expand spindles in Shanghai. The Japanese yarn industry's invasion of us in the fifteenth year was to develop in the interior. Therefore, at that time, yarn mills were established in various ports along the Yangtze River. Later, due to the difficulty of coping with incidents in various locations, it has recently changed again and concentrated its development in Shanghai and Qingdao. Shanghai is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River and can control the entire basin, making it the source of its competition. Qingdao is an important port in Shandong Province and can control North China, making it the tail end of its dumping. Therefore, the yarn industry in our country in the 23rd year is still not optimistic.</p>
<h3>International Trade Association Requests</h3>
<p>Reduce Tax Rate on Goods Transported to France</p>
<p>Comments on the Petition Table to Adelman</p>
<p>Hoping France Will Reduce Tax Rates on Our Country's Goods</p>
<p>Shen Shi News, this city: Adelman, Vice President of the Paris International Trade Association, previously sent a petition table to promote Sino-French trade and requested that two Chinese representatives be appointed to participate in the International Trade Association. The Paris International Trade Association held a meeting last year. The International Trade Bureau forwarded the order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to select representatives. However, due to the proximity of the meeting, it was not possible to send personnel. This time, the association sent a petition table and again requested that representatives be appointed. The Consul General in Paris intends to appoint Lu Qinzai and Ma Shoubai as representatives to attend the meeting nearby. The ministry ordered the Trade Bureau to forward the request to the Chamber of Commerce and the China International Trade Association for reply. According to inquiries by the Shen Shi News reporter, the China International Trade Association agrees with the Consul General in Paris's intention to have Lu and Ma represent it at the meeting. As for the items mentioned in the petition table of the Paris International Trade Association, the association has considered them in detail and has prepared opinions to be forwarded to the National Trade Bureau for reference. Excerpts of its opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>Advocating Maintaining the Current Tax Rate (Above Omitted) Regarding the association's (referring to the Paris International Trade Association, hereinafter the same) request to reduce the tax rates on French specialty industrial products, such as wool yarn, woolen fabrics, cloth, printed cloth, raw silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, perfumes, cosmetics, lace, champagne, high-grade brandy, and cheese, etc., it is noted that customs duties are divided into fiscal taxes and protective taxes. The purpose of fiscal taxes is to enrich the national treasury, and the height of their tax rates is naturally limited. The purpose of protective taxes is to protect domestic industries and resist foreign competition, and the intention of their tax rates is naturally different from fiscal taxes. However, they should also take into account the interests of consumers and not exceed the necessary limit. Moreover, if the tax rate is too high, smuggling is inevitable, and administrative expenses will expand accordingly, which may result in more harm than good. Since our country's tariff autonomy, the tax rates on wool yarn, woolen fabrics, cloth, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, perfumes, cosmetics, and cheese have indeed increased compared to the old tax rates. However, these goods either have luxury characteristics, or although they are not luxury goods, they are not French specialties. Due to the most-favored-nation clause in our country's customs treaties, if the tax rate on these French imports is reduced, similar products from other countries will also benefit, which may not be possible at present. This association believes that maintaining the current tax rate for a considerable period of time is a compromise that takes both sides into account.</p>
<p>Supporting the Reduction of Rayon Tax Regarding the association's request to separately stipulate the tax rates for raw silk and rayon, and that rayon is a daily necessity and should not be taxed too heavily, it is noted that rayon is a raw material for fabrics, and our country does not currently produce it. Its tax rate should not be compared with that of natural silk, and it should be levied at a lower rate. In the past, rayon was taxed at 5% of its value, but in 1929, it was increased to 10% of its value. Calculated at the prices at that time, it was equivalent to a tax of more than 10 taels per dan. In the 1931 tariff, it was changed to a specific tax of 58 gold units per dan. Since August 1932, it has been raised again to 73 gold units per dan, which is equivalent to more than 80% of its value. The tax rate cannot be said to be high. The import tax on rayon in India is only 25% of its value, and in Japan it is 101 Japanese yen per 100 catties, which are all lighter than in our country. Since the successive tax increases, the import volume of rayon has tended to decline year by year, and smuggling is rampant, which has harmed legitimate merchants. The association's statement on reducing the import tax on rayon is feasible from both the perspectives of developing domestic industries and expanding the national treasury.</p>
<p>Trademark Rights and Interests Are Not a Problem Regarding the association's request to protect trademark rights and the original names of various commodities, such as champagne, brandy, and cheese, it is noted that Article 6 of our country's Trademark Law stipulates that "Foreign nationals who wish to exclusively use their trademarks in accordance with treaties on the mutual protection of trademarks shall apply for registration in accordance with this law." Therefore, French imports that have been registered can be protected by law, which is not a problem.</p>
<p>Export Agencies Should Be Abolished as Soon as Possible Regarding the association's request to reduce the taxes on various important Chinese exports, it is noted that taxing export goods will increase the cost of domestic products and reduce their competitiveness in the international market. In modern times, except for a few special monopoly exports that are still taxed, most countries not only exempt taxes on general goods but also provide subsidies. Our country's international trade has long been in a deficit position. In recent years, due to the loss of a part of the trade in the three northeastern provinces and the impact of the global economic recession and the increase in tariff barriers in various countries, the amount of the deficit has intensified. In 1932, it reached more than 500 million yuan, and in 1933, it reached more than 700 million yuan. The future is dangerous beyond words. Export taxes should be abolished as soon as possible as a remedy after the fact.</p>
<p>Hoping France Will Give Preferential Treatment to National Goods It is noted that international trade aims to facilitate the exchange of goods, and customs duties should be based on the principle of reciprocity, which is beneficial to both parties. The French side requests that our country reduce import taxes, and this association expresses its strong support. However, at the same time, it is hoped that France can also give corresponding preferential treatment to our country's exports. It is noted that the Sino-French Customs Treaty stipulates that the Chinese goods that enjoy the lowest tax rate include pure silk fabrics, pure silk scarves, pure silk crepe, pure silk nets, pure silk lace, pepper, chili, cinnamon, whole and shelled nutmeg, cloves, and tea. However, the large-volume goods exported to France, such as eggs and egg products, peanuts, raw silk, raincoats, straw hat braids, pig intestines, pig bristles, tung oil, cowhide, and antimony, have not been explicitly included in the lowest tax rate, which undoubtedly hinders the promotion of Sino-French trade. This association hopes that the association will understand this situation and propose to the French government that the above-mentioned goods be allowed to apply the lowest tax rate, which will greatly benefit the progress of trade between the two countries. (Below Omitted) It is heard that the association's opinion letter has been sent by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to the International Trade Bureau and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and will be forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Paris International Trade Association for reference, so as to promote trade between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Ship Collision Meeting Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>The Ship Collision Dispute Handling Committee of the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications held its seventh meeting at the bureau yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. The attendees were Sha Huijia, Xu Zufan, Chen Ganqing, Zhang Shuzun, and Zou Zhidong, who attended as an observer. Zhu Yaoting (represented by Yu Shifan) presided over the meeting, and Zhu Guanying served as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss the various cases as follows: (1) To determine the repair costs of the Baohua ship of the Ping'an Shipping Company and the Daxing No. 1 ship of the Daxing Shipping Company after they collided near Taiping Port in Beisha. (Resolution) As per the previous meeting, the Daxing No. 1 ship should be responsible for 70% of the negligence, and the Baohua ship should be responsible for 30% of the negligence. (2) To determine the repair costs of the Lijiang ship of the Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee and the Meiwamaru small ship of the Shanghai Transportation Company after they collided in Puzhong. (Resolution) As per the previous meeting, both parties should be equally responsible for the losses. (3) The case of the Huaian ship of the Zhengji Company and the Fengxiang ship of the Taifeng Shipping Company colliding in Puzhong. After mediation by the committee, the Taifeng Shipping Company stated that they were dissatisfied with the previous decision. How should it be handled? Please re-vote. (Resolution) Continue to follow the original resolution of the committee. (4) The case of the Hongyuan ship of the Sanbei Company sinking Tao Shilong's fishing boat near Wuhu. (Resolution) Because Tao Shilong did not arrive today, it will be discussed again at the next meeting. (5) The case of the Hongxing ship of the Daxing Shipping Company damaging Lin Lifeng's large sailboat. (Resolution) This case requires the collection of evidence before further discussion. (6) The case of the Jinyuanshun sailboat being damaged by the Japanese ship Katsuragisan Maru. (Resolution) After interviewing the captain of the Katsuragisan Maru, further discussion will be held. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Commander Imamura</h3>
<p>Visited Wang Shouting Yesterday to Congratulate Him on His Appointment</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Imamura, the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, along with two aides-de-camp, visited the newly appointed Commander Wang Shouting of the Naval Training Fleet at the Gaochangmiao Naval Training Fleet Headquarters yesterday morning at around 11:00 a.m. to express his congratulations.

After talking for about 15 minutes, he said goodbye and left.</p>
<h3>Water Price Research Association</h3>
<p>Meeting Today to Solicit Opinions from All Parties</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association Sends Kui Yanfang to Attend</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai British Concession Water Company changed the block-rate water system to a meter system, disputes have repeatedly arisen between tenants and landlords. This is because the rents in the Public Concession vary greatly between the central areas and the remote areas. Moreover, the residents in the remote areas are mostly laborers. In a single house, it is often divided into five or six households, and the water consumption is higher than in the central areas. Previously, when the water fee was charged at 7.5% of the rent, the burden was very light. Now that the water fee is paid according to the meter system, the difference is huge, so the landlords refuse to pay, resulting in the tragedy of water being cut off. In order to study and resolve the above-mentioned disputes, the Public Concession Bureau of Works has specially formed a Water Price Research Committee, inviting Feng Bingnan, Mei Jiufu of the Bureau of Works, and Canna, the manager of the Mobil Oil Company, to be committee members on the Chinese side. In order to solicit opinions from all parties, it has been decided to convene the chairman of the Western Real Estate Association and the chairman of the Shanghai Real Estate Association to attend the meeting at 3:00 p.m. today to submit opinions for adoption. Kui Yanfang has been designated to attend on behalf of the Real Estate Association, and a letter was sent to the association yesterday, stating: We have received your letter and are respectfully informed that Mr. Kui Yanfang has been designated to represent this association at the meeting of your committee at 3:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month. We hope that you will take note of this.</p>
<h3>Fifteenth Branch of the First Special District</h3>
<p>Rent Reduction Committee Established</p>
<p>Notice to Citizens in the District to Register</p>
<p>The Rent Reduction Movement Notice of the Fifteenth Branch of the First Special District of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee states: For the purpose of notification, since the city has been affected by the January 28th Incident, the market has been depressed, business is in distress, and the livelihood of citizens is difficult to maintain. At a time when prices are low and the countryside is bankrupt, the high rent in this city remains the same. If the rent is not reduced, how can the livelihood of the citizens be maintained and the prosperity of the market be promoted? This association is entrusted by all members and bears the important responsibility of reducing rents. It was announced on the 6th of this month and should be actively carried out to achieve its goal. Therefore, we hereby notify the citizens in the district of North and South Suzhou Roads, North Shanxi Roads, Tiantong Roads, Santai Roads, and various alleys to quickly come to the association to register, so as to establish branch associations in each alley, concentrate our strength to make preparations, and vow to fight to the death to achieve our goals. This matter concerns the livelihood of citizens and the prosperity of the market. We hope that you will pay attention to it. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping, Theft, and Bandit Crimes Sentenced</h3>
<p>Fan Xiaomei, a young woman from Gaoyou, 19 years old, recently came to Shanghai from her hometown and lived in a bungalow in Xinjiamu Bridge, Hongkou, intending to find work in a yarn mill. She was tricked by her fellow villagers Zhang Baocheng and Zhang Zirong to go to New World for entertainment between December 19th of last year. Later, they went to the Hongyun Hotel at 564 Haining Road and prevented her from going out. They colluded with Zhou Hailin, who was at large, and planned to sell her to a man surnamed Li for 190 yuan to be his wife. However, the matter was discovered by Chinese Detective Xu Yongyuan of the Hongkou Police Station, who secretly went with a Western detective and arrested the two Zhangs. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhang Zirong had also committed theft with his accomplice Chen Haiqing from Jiangbei, who was hiding at 762 Lafayette Road in the French Concession. The detectives went again and arrested Chen, along with the bill of sale, and brought them to the police station. Fan Xiaomei was claimed by her family. After investigation, it was found that Zhang Zirong and Chen Haiqing had committed armed robbery with accomplices between September and December 5th of last year, robbing the households of Yuan Cao, 42 Xinzha Road, Tan Wang, 1007 Roberts Road, Cao Yunming, 1485 Yuyuan Road, and Zhao Kenzai, 1035 Jinsheng Road, of valuables worth more than 1,300 yuan. They were sent to the First Special District Court, but Zhang Zirong only admitted to one case of theft. They were ordered to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui came to the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhang Baocheng to two years of imprisonment, Zhang Zirong to four years of imprisonment, and Chen Haiqing to nine years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the final judgment will be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment. The bill of sale was confiscated. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Bureau of Works, stated that the defendants had also committed theft and robbery in the Chinese territory. The Public Security Bureau sent detectives to the court today to transfer them, but the Yulin Road Police Station also had robbery cases committed by these people. It is necessary to investigate them in detail. Please postpone the transfer. Judge Liu approved this and informed Detective Chen Guiqing of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>

<h3>Detectives Bravely Fired Bullets Like a String of Beads</h3>
<p>One Thief Shot Dead, One Thief Captured</p>
<p>Robbery in Yihe Alley, North Chengdu Road Last Night</p>
<p>Three Thieves Came Together, Resulting in Only One Thief Escaping</p>
<p>- Random Bullet Injured Two Passersby -</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter in this city, theft cases have occurred frequently in various places, even several times a day. Fortunately, the city's police organs have spared no effort in pursuing and arresting them, so the detection of cases is also very rapid. However, a group of people who are willing to violate the law and take risks is like this. Therefore, if the residents' door and window security is slightly careless, they will be taken advantage of. At 6:30 p.m. yesterday, when a certain family at No. 48, Yihe Alley, North Chengdu Road, was having dinner, three bandits suddenly broke into the back door. One bandit guarded the back door, one bandit and one bandit with a gun went straight into the inner room, shouted at everyone, forbade them to make a sound, and watched them. At the same time, they forced the victim to hand over the keys, and the unarmed bandit went to each room to search, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and looted almost everything. All the jewelry and cash were looted in large quantities. After about half an hour, they left after a full looting and fled in the direction of South Chengdu Road. When the victim saw this, he chased out anxiously and shouted to catch the robbers. The nearby patrol officers heard the news and immediately fired their guns and chased after them, blowing their whistles madly. At this time, the Chengdu</p>
<p>Road Police Station also got the news and urgently dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to cooperate in the pursuit. When the bandits saw this, they fled urgently in the direction of Chenjiabang Small Vegetable Market. However, at this time, the Chinese and Western detectives had also arrived. The bandits were in a hurry, so the bandit with the gun fired a shot. At this time, the detectives also fired their guns at the same time, and bullets like a string of beads were shot at the bandits. One of the bandits fell to the ground in response and was shot dead on the spot by the detectives. Before long, one bandit was also injured and captured. However, there was still one bandit who escaped. At the same time, two passersby, Liu Jinrong from Nanjing, 25 years old, and Cai Ronggen, a local, 23 years old, were injured by stray bullets because they happened to be passing by during the fierce battle and did not have time to avoid them. Liu was injured in his left shoulder, and Cai was grazed by a bullet. They were all sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by Western Police Car No. 231. The injured bandit was escorted back to the police station. After a brief interrogation, he was transferred to the hospital for treatment because he had suffered serious injuries. He will be dealt with according to the law after he recovers. At the same time, the accomplices who escaped are being pursued. The body of the dead bandit will be reported for autopsy this morning. The amount of losses suffered by the victim is not known in detail.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Water Recedes Again</h3>
<p>Wuhu: 7 feet 9 inches</p>
<p>Unprecedented Shallow Water</p>
<p>All Ships of Six Companies are Hindered</p>
<p>The current low water level of the Yangtze River is rarely seen in previous years. At the lowest point, the downstream water level receded to 8 feet 9 inches, causing all Yangtze River steamers to be stopped. On the 5th of this month, the Jianghan Customs announced that the waterway south of Madang was one foot and four inches deeper than the original Laogang channel, allowing steamers to pass. Unexpectedly, by the 6th, the water level in the southern channel had again dropped to 9 feet 8 inches. Contrary to expectations, the water level in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River receded even further yesterday, reaching a record low that has never been seen before. Even ships of around 1,000 tons cannot pass. The situation is being investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<p>(Significant Drop in Downstream Water Level) This time, the low water level in the Yangtze River first appeared in Wuhu and then moved to Madang Port near Xiaogushan. The water level in that section was only 8 feet 9 inches at its lowest, causing Yangtze River boats passing through to either run aground or scrape the bottom. Just as the shipping industry was overjoyed that the southern channel was open to Shanghai, the water level unexpectedly dropped after only one day, though ships could still manage to sail. Unexpectedly, the water level in the downstream Wuhu area fell drastically today, reaching an unprecedented low of only 7 feet 9 inches, a record low for the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>(Report from Wuhu) Yesterday at noon, the Shanghai Sanbei Steamship Company received an urgent telegram from its Wuhu branch stating that since the night of the 6th, the water level in the Wuhu area of the lower Yangtze River had dropped sharply. The shallowest point is now only 7 feet 9 inches, which is shallower than the Madang Laogang water gauge. Not only can larger steamers not pass, but even third and fourth-class ships can hardly navigate. Generally, the smallest type of Yangtze River boat requires a draft of at least eight feet when empty, unless it is a shallow-water-class ship from the upper reaches.</p>
<p>(Ships of Various Companies Hindered) A few days ago, when Madang had shallow water, the Yangtze River steamers of the six companies in Shanghai could still reach Anqing to unload cargo and passengers, using small tugboats to pull them through the mud. Now that the water level in Wuhu has dropped to 7 feet 9 inches, the upstream ships of the various companies, even when empty of cargo and passengers, can hardly be towed through. They can only send barges from both upstream and downstream to transship cargo, turning the Yangtze River steamers into connecting vessels halfway. The Jing'an, the Sanbei Company's ship with the shallowest draft, was also reported by the Wuhu branch yesterday to be unable to pass through this shallow section.</p>
<p>(Losses During the Low-Water Period) This time, the low water level in the Yangtze River has blocked both the upper and lower reaches. The reporter met with Director Wei and Mr. Lao of the Jiejianhua Company today. They said that last year, the various shipping companies on the Yangtze River line suffered business losses, and last month, they were hindered by the low water level. The grounding of Yangtze River steamers on the upper and lower reaches and the delays caused by the blockage of all the steamers affected no fewer than fifty or sixty ships. Each ship lost an extra four or five hundred yuan for each delay of two days per trip. Since the water level receded, it has been three weeks. Some Yangtze River steamers have run aground, while others have been stranded en route. The shallow-water fees charged by the shipping companies are hardly enough to cover the cost of tugboats and small laborers. In total, the losses from the low water level of the Yangtze River over the past twenty days are truly shocking. Now that the water level in Wuhu has dropped to 7 feet 9 inches, the shipping companies are suffering even greater losses.</p>

<h3>The "Stealing the Sky and Swapping the Sun"</h3>
<p>Loan Scam Exposed</p>
<p>Where Did the Paste Come From?</p>
<p>The Judge Saw Through Everything</p>
<p>Cheng Gongyuan, residing at No. 54 Yu Kang Li, Pi Shao Nai Road, French Concession, previously engaged in the jewelry business. In 1923, he was introduced by a friend to the Star Film Company and became acquainted with his colleague, Shen Guozhen. Later, Cheng returned home to care for his sick father. During that time, Shen Guozhen often visited Cheng's home for casual conversation. Cheng noticed that Shen was wearing a high-quality military uniform and asked Shen about his official position. Shen replied that he was a military officer and encouraged Cheng to enter politics, offering to help him find a position. Cheng was deeply grateful. Later, Shen said that if he succeeded in finding a position for Cheng, Cheng would need to pay a reward. Cheng voluntarily agreed to pay 500 foreign dollars if the matter was successful. At that time, a note was written and given to Shen to take away. Unexpectedly, Shen brought the note to Cheng the next day, saying that the reward was too vague. He had prepared a draft that was changed to "payment upon obtaining the position" and asked Cheng to sign it. Cheng thought it was reasonable and signed the note, adding his seal. From that day on, there was no news. Cheng assumed that Shen had not succeeded in finding him a position. Until March of 1932, Cheng suddenly received a letter from a lawyer entrusted by Shen, urging him to return a diamond ring weighing one carat, three gold bracelets weighing four taels each, and fifty pearls worth seven yuan each, for which Cheng had written a loan note. Cheng stated that he had not borrowed anything and denied it through his lawyer. However, Shen Guozhen filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court. Cheng Gongyuan read the loan note in court and confirmed that the signature was indeed his. He was speechless and unable to defend himself, resulting in a loss in the case and a judgment to repay the current value. However, after the judgment, Cheng was unwilling and tried to figure out what had happened. He realized that he had written a note entrusting Shen to find him a position, and because the scope was not specified, Shen Guozhen wrote a draft note and asked him to sign it. He must have realized that this was the source of the trouble. Therefore, he hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to appeal to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The court session was held a few days ago, and Judge Guo Dezhang and Investigator Li attended the court. The appellant, Cheng Gongyuan, carefully examined the signature area of the loan note and noticed traces of paste next to it. He then realized that the note Shen Guozhen had brought to be replaced was a layered piece of patterned paper. After the appellant signed and sealed it, the upper layer was removed and the false note was arbitrarily written. Judge Guo questioned the appellee, Shen Guozhen, as to why there were traces of paste around the signature area of the loan note. Shen claimed that he did not know. Judge Guo believed it was a case of fraud and forgery. The debate was then concluded, and the date for the verdict was set for yesterday. Judge Hao announced the main text of the verdict, overturning the original judgment. The appellee's request for the previous portion was dismissed, and the costs of the two lawsuits were borne by the appellee. The case is called "Great Exposure."</p>
<h3>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Trigger a Great Disturbance</h3>
<p>Did the Mother Secretly Murder Her Own Grandson?</p>
<p>The Truth of the Family Matter Must Be Thoroughly Investigated</p>
<p>Chen Zhang, a woman from Gaoyou, is 61 years old and has two sons. The elder son is named Erhai (30 years old), and the younger son is Erzhu (24 years old). Chen Zhang lives with her younger son, Erzhu, in their hometown, farming the land. Erhai lives with his wife, Chen Wang (named Da Qiaolian), at No. 57, Alley 189, Changchun Road, Dusiwei Road, Hongkou, working in a Japanese-owned company, leaving early and returning late. Wang also works in a yarn factory. The family's finances are quite comfortable. This year, around the autumn of the lunar calendar, Chen Zhang came to Shanghai with her younger son, Yizhu, due to famine in their hometown, and lived with her elder son and his wife. Erhai handed over the management of the family's finances to his mother. Erhai's wife, Wang, was very unhappy and told her father, Wang Hengyuan, (who lived nearby) who repeatedly used excuses to pick quarrels with Chen Zhang, even teaming up with his younger sister, Xiao Qiaolian, (22 years old) to make Zhang miserable. Because she had no way to live in her hometown, she endured the abuse and barely survived. Yesterday morning, Chen Zhang went to the Local Court to lodge a complaint, stating that her eldest son Erhai's grandson, who was only 80 days old, was lively and cute, and had no illnesses. On the night before last (the evening of the 5th), at 4 o'clock, the wicked daughter-in-law Wang murdered the grandson. The wicked daughter-in-law actually harmed her own grandson, which is extremely cruel. Now, a scar has been found on the top of the grandson's head, and the scrotum is clear and purple, and blood is flowing from the mouth and nose, indicating that he was undoubtedly murdered. Yesterday, Chen Wang and her younger sister Xiao Qiaolian were arrested and detained by the police at the First Precinct of the Fifth District. She is requesting an examination of the body and asking for the wicked daughter-in-law to be severely punished. Subsequently, after a preliminary hearing by the prosecutor, the order was given to wait for the examination before a decision could be made.</p>
<h3>Muslims Investigate "The Romance of the Fragrant Concubine"</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, various Muslim organizations in this city recently received a telegram from the Nanchang City Mosque and Qingzhen Elementary School in Jiangxi Province, stating that since the people of their religion have always adhered to a policy of isolation, adhering to old customs internally and lacking publicity externally, people outside the religion do not understand the content of religious doctrines. There are often those with a smattering of knowledge who fabricate groundless rumors and write insulting things. Therefore, there was previously the "Little Pig Bajie" incident from the Beixin Bookstore and Nanhua Literary and Art Publishing House in Shanghai. Before one wave subsides, another arises. Recently, they saw that the Nanchang Guangyi Bookstore was selling "The Romance of the Fragrant Concubine" published by the Shanghai Jingzhi Bookstore. The book was published in 1926, and the editor was a Mr. Hu. It is not known which province he is from. Upon investigation, the first four chapters of the book are full of words that insult Islam and slander the saints, which is almost worse than the books of Nanhua Literary and Art Publishing House. Moreover, the book is priced very cheaply, and many people are buying it. It is rumored that the copyright has now been resold to the Shanghai Guangyi Bookstore for distribution in various provincial capitals. After consulting with their colleagues, they approached the Nanchang Guangyi Bookstore near them without raising any suspicion and investigated "The Romance of the Fragrant Concubine" that had not yet been sold. There were still twenty-one copies. Subsequently, a representative was publicly elected and asked the responsible Public Security Bureau to forcibly confiscate and seal up the book, permanently prohibiting its sale. In Nanchang, a strict ban has been approved, but there are many distributors. In addition to Nanchang, Guangyi Bookstores have been established in Changsha, Guangzhou, Beiping, Hankou, Kaifeng, and various other ports. If serious negotiations are not conducted with the Shanghai Guangyi Bookstore at this time to burn the plates and search for and completely destroy the books at various distribution points, the disaster will continue to sprout. We hope that colleagues from all parties will unanimously ban the books as soon as possible and investigate the editor, Mr. Hu, and submit a request to the government to punish him severely in accordance with the law, as a warning to others. We still hope that in the future, attention will be paid to the novels and literature sold by bookstores in various provinces, counties, and major ports. All books that insult our Islamic religion should be destroyed and banned from sale. All books of the Canon of Islam published by our Islamic religion can still be displayed in various libraries for non-Muslims to browse from time to time, so as to serve as propaganda. The above methods can prevent insults in the future. The telegram is urgent, and we are filled with anticipation. It is reported that after receiving the telegram, the various Muslim organizations in this city are currently discussing how to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang-Danyang-Jintan-Liyang Long-Distance Buses</h3>
<p>Joint Transportation with the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>Effective from March 1st</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang-Danyang-Jintan-Liyang long-distance bus route runs from Zhenjiang via Danyang to Jintan (the section from Jintan to Liyang is not yet open to traffic). The company submitted a request last year to arrange joint transportation with the Jinpu Railway and requested a stop on the road at Danyang Station. The Traffic Department of the two railways sent personnel to discuss the joint transportation arrangements, and the Engineering Department ordered workers to fill in the pond at Danyang Station to facilitate the company's stop. The joint transportation contract and procedures have recently been approved and formally signed by the administrative bureaus of the two railways and will take effect on March 1st. The following is a summary of the contract: The Railway Bureau will sell joint tickets at six stations: Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai. Before the company completes the entire route, it will temporarily sell joint tickets at Jintan Station. Other stations can be gradually expanded with the agreement of both parties when needed. Danyang will be the connecting station for both parties. The Railway Bureau will provide transportation according to the class specified on the ticket, while the company will not differentiate between classes. The validity period of the joint transportation ticket will be two days. If the train is delayed by 15 minutes or less, the company will wait for the original bus. If the delay exceeds 15 minutes, the company will use a special bus to transport the passengers according to the number of passengers. The company's operating hours are from 6:55 AM to 5:11 PM daily. The Railway Bureau's joint transportation station will not sell joint tickets for any train that cannot reach Danyang Railway Station by 4:10 PM. The company can sell joint tickets during operating hours, except for night buses. If the operating schedule needs to be modified, both parties must notify each other in advance. In addition to passenger buses, the company is equipped with luggage trailers to transport joint transportation luggage and packages. All freight charges will be collected from passengers.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Merchant Yuan Ludeng and Others</h3>
<p>Raise Funds to Mine Poyang Coal Mine</p>
<p>Shanghai business figures, including Yuan Ludeng, have initiated the organization of the Poyang Mining Company and decided on a capital of 1.6 million yuan. Further expansion will be made based on the development of the business in the future. The mining area is located in Dongxiang, Poyang County, and is extremely rich in reserves. The location is also very convenient for transportation, which will not be a problem. The mine was originally approved by the Ministry of Industry and the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry for local people to raise funds for mining, but the scale was very small, and only about three tons of coal could be produced per day. As a result, Yuan Ludeng and others applied for approval from the Ministry of Industry to jointly operate the mine under a contract and organize the Poyang Mining Company. It is expected that after its establishment, the mine can produce about 1,000 tons of coal per day.</p>
<h3>A Detective from the Horse Road Engages in a Fierce Battle with Thieves</h3>
<p>Both Sides Open Fire for About Ten Minutes</p>
<p>One Thief Dead and One Injured, the Rest Escape</p>
<p>After a robbery occurred on North Chengdu Road, and the detective shot and killed one thief and captured another on the spot, the police station, in addition to searching everywhere for the thieves, immediately dispatched more detectives to inspect pedestrians along the roads within its jurisdiction. At about 10:20 PM, a Western detective from the police station, leading four Chinese detectives, was conducting an inspection at the intersection of Ma Road and Horse Road when they suddenly saw four or five dark shadows lurking on the corner of the road. The detectives immediately went forward together and shouted to stop and wait for the search. Before the detective could finish speaking, the other party fired, and it was realized that the thieves were hiding there, hoping to rob someone. The detectives immediately returned fire, and a fierce battle broke out for about ten minutes. One of the thieves was shot down by the detective. Before long, another thief fell down. At the same time, the gunfire from the thieves also stopped. The detectives quickly chased after them, but the remaining thieves had escaped. Looking down at the ground, one thief was seriously injured and died, and one thief was slightly injured. They were taken to the police station. The body of the dead thief will be reported and examined this morning. The confiscated guns and bullets have been put on file, pending the arrest of the accomplices and referral to the court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Notorious Robber Xu Gui Fa and Accomplices</h3>
<p>Specializing in Robbing Wealthy Merchants, Committing Numerous Crimes</p>
<p>The Major Robbery at Liu Ru Yu's Residence Was Also Perpetrated by This Gang</p>
<p>Three to Five Years Ago, They Ambushed and Robbed Over 100,000 Yuan Being Transported for the Bank of China</p>
<p>- Arrested This Time Due to a Love Triangle -</p>
<p>The case of the Dongtai native Yuan Zhaoqing, who owned a rickshaw company at No. 1 Zhishun Lane, Pu'en Jishe Road, Xiaobang Bay, French Concession, being invaded by bandits on the evening of the 29th of last month, and robbed of over four thousand gold yuan in clothing and cash, was solved by the Second Detective Group of the French Police, including Chief Detective Lu Zhulin, Wang Rusong, Deputy Detective Zhang Daorong, Detectives Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshi, etc., as early as 5 p.m. the next day (the 30th). The ringleader Xu Guifa and his accomplices Chen Zurong, Chen Jinchang, Chen Kejian, Chen Shurong, Zhang Qifu, Zhang Guibao, Zhang Asan, and female bandits Chen Shi, Chen Ge, Huang Linmei, etc., eleven men and women in total, were successively arrested at No. 128 and a half Fuxu Road in the Public Concession and No. 18 Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei. Five Browning pistols, forty-nine bullets, and three hundred yuan in original stolen banknotes were confiscated and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. During the continued investigation, it was also discovered that bandit Chen Jinchang, in October of the 17th year of the Republic of China, due to a love triangle with Wei Qiliang from Siyang, lured Wei to an open space in Qianjiatang, Arbert Road, and shot him dead. The situation of waiting for a record of confession and being sent to court for interrogation has already been reported in the newspapers. Now, it is learned that public concession detectives have also discovered that last month, when Samsung Stage Manager Zhou Bingcheng was hosting a banquet for guests at Liu Ru Yu's residence on Shantou Road, several robbers suddenly broke in and robbed the host, surnamed Zhou, and the guest, surnamed Zhang, as well as prostitutes, of pistols, five diamond rings, and a large amount of cash. This major case was also a group robbery committed by this gang. The diamond ring of the Lu family, worth over ten thousand yuan, has been sold for eight hundred yuan, which was divided and spent. It is heard that the Public Concession authorities dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the French Concession yesterday morning, requesting that the robbers be temporarily transferred to their custody for investigation before being sent back for trial when the Second Special Court opens. The French Concession Police have approved the request and handed over the robbers to the detectives for interrogation. It is also heard that these bandits are among the top figures in the gang, specializing in robbing wealthy merchants and households. Three to five years ago, they ambushed and robbed over 100,000 yuan being transported for the Chinese Bank of China. Among the five pistols that were displayed, four were obtained through robbery, one belonging to the Lu family, and the other three were robbed from Indian patrol officers, Chinese patrol officers, and Chinese border police in the Chinese territory, and used as weapons for robbery. It is also heard that the arrest this time was due to indiscretion caused by romantic affairs. According to reports, the bandit Xu Guifa, nicknamed "Rotten Foot Little Ningbo," is bold, strong, and exceptionally brave, and is regarded as the leader by his followers. After robbing the Yuan family's stolen goods this time, two of his followers quarreled over a woman, causing jealousy. Xu specially hosted a banquet to invite both sides to the scene, hoping to resolve the discord and reconcile them. Half of the purpose was to celebrate the successful robberies by inviting the rest of the gang to the scene for a celebratory drink. Unexpectedly, on that day, two bandits arrived by car in front of Xu Guifa's house at No. 128 and a half Fuxu Road. As they got out of the car, the victim, surnamed Yuan, happened to pass by and recognized the faces of the robbers, so he secretly reported to the police. The police immediately ordered the detectives to rush to the address and arrest them, resulting in a complete capture. It is truly said that evil deeds reach their limit, and the net of heaven is vast, with no escape. Once a strict and thorough investigation is conducted, there will surely be confessions of more major robberies.</p>
<h3>A Bomb Hidden in Bread</h3>
<p>Thugs Intimidate Zheng Qiuting</p>
<p>Initially Demanding a Huge Sum of 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>- Detectives Negotiate on Behalf and Arrest Two Thugs -</p>
<p>Zheng Qiuting, a Chaozhou native, also known as Shaoqiu, courtesy name Kejun, lives at No. 10 Meifu Lane, Parker Road. He runs the Fa Ji Coal Company and the Parker Road Yongyuan Pawnshop in Hankou Road, and his business is booming. He has accumulated a lot of wealth, which has attracted the attention of bandits. On February 6th of this year, Zheng suddenly received a threatening letter delivered by mail, signed by the "Blood Soul Assassination Squad," which stated that Zheng had previously engaged in drug trafficking in the Tianjin area and made a huge profit. The squad was short of funds and requested Zheng to provide substantial assistance in order to protect his business interests. Zheng ignored the letter. Later, the bandits repeatedly threatened him by phone, demanding 30,000 yuan. Zheng continued to stall with empty words. On the morning of the 4th of this month, a rectangular loaf of bread was suddenly found in the middle of the small gate outside Zheng's house. The servant handed it to Zheng, who examined it carefully and saw a round bomb in the middle of the bread, with a threatening letter attached. The letter accused Zheng of deliberately delaying and refusing to pay the ransom, and warned him with an attached explosive device. The letter demanded that Zheng quickly send 30,000 yuan to the fields near the new Shanghai Municipal Government in Jiangwan. The person delivering the money should carry a calendar as a sign. Zheng was shocked and immediately went to the Xin Zha Police Station in his jurisdiction to report to the head of the police. He immediately ordered Western Detective Chief Li Te, Chinese Detective Chiefs Tang Jian and Yao Yuanlong, Detectives Su Yinggen and Yang Peizhang, Detectives Yang Yunfeng and Xia Yeshan, etc., to investigate. In addition to taking the bomb and the previous two threatening letters back to the police station to prevent danger, he also ordered detectives to stay at Zheng's house and maintain strict vigilance. On the morning of the 5th, the telephone at Zheng's house rang loudly. The detectives on duty answered the call. It was indeed the bandits calling to inquire if there was any sincerity in negotiating. The detectives replied that there was indeed sincerity, but the ransom was too large and the negotiation location was too far away in Jiangwan, making it inconvenient to travel back and forth. They requested to change the location and reduce the ransom. The two sides negotiated for a long time on the phone. The bandits gradually reduced the ransom from 30,000 yuan to several thousand yuan, and the detectives also deliberately haggled. They initially agreed to several hundred yuan, then increased to one thousand yuan, but still without result. So they agreed to continue the discussion at a later time. Unexpectedly, at 8 p.m., the bandits called again. The detectives answered the call again. After a brief discussion, the amount gradually approached an agreement. As a result, it was agreed to meet at the entrance of the Yuegong Restaurant on North Sichuan Road from 3 to 4 p.m. on the 6th, still using a calendar as a secret sign. After obtaining the exact address, the detectives reported to the head of the police, who ordered trusted detectives to disguise themselves and go to the scene to wait on time. He also sent a detective to pretend to be Zheng's representative, carrying a calendar in one hand and a paper package in the other, pretending to be several thousand yuan in cash, and wandering around the Yuegong Restaurant. At 3:30 p.m., two bandits, Chen Dimin and Chen Xiangyao from Jiangsu, arrived. Xiangyao stood in the middle of the road as a lookout, while Dimin stepped forward and spoke to the detective pretending to be the representative. At that moment, the detectives swarmed forward and arrested the two Chens and took them to the police station. Subsequently, Chen Dimin led the detectives, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, to No. 7 Xingaoyang Lane, Qimei Road, Zhabei, where they confiscated many pieces of iron used to make bombs and took them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First District Court. Police Lawyer Jiang Baolian rose to explain the circumstances of the case and requested a postponement in order to continue the investigation. After Judge Xue Lanru interrogated Zheng Qiuting and the two defendants, he ordered Chen Dimin and Chen Xiangyao to be remanded in custody pending further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3>Mailing Morphine Discovered</h3>
<p>At around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, a package from Guangdong and Hong Kong addressed to You Ting Ji in Shanghai arrived at the Wenjiaqiao Postal Branch in West Shanghai. The addressee, Wang Mingxing, a Sichuan native residing at No. 89 Run'an Lane, West Gate Road, French Concession, was sent to the branch to collect it. After the postal worker retrieved the package, he discovered that there were hidden items inside. Upon opening the package, he found a bag of morphine weighing 175 grams. As the matter concerned the private mailing of prohibited drugs, the branch immediately sent the witness and the package to the Sixth District Sub-Station in Zhoujiamei, and then transferred them to the Sixth District Police Bureau. After interrogation by District Officer Xing, the bureau prepared a document and sent it back to the branch for handling.</p>
<h3>Zhou Exuan and Zhang Zhuying Lawsuit Awaits Re-Examination</h3>
<p>Zhou Exuan, the eldest son of Zhou Weishi, the owner of Zhou Geng Ji Yarn Shop, a wealthy Suzhou merchant in Shanghai, had a brief affair with the famous prostitute Hong Lou Lao Si (i.e., Zhang Zhuying) ten years ago, and had a son named Dayuan. After his parents found out, they dissolved the small family he had formed, and the two lovers separated. However, Dayuan was still raised by Zhang, with Zhou responsible for the ______________. After Zhou stopped paying living expenses seven months ago, Zhang, on behalf of her son, sued Zhou ______________ in the First Special District Court. The case has already been heard once. Because Zhou denied it, he was ordered to summon witnesses to prove the facts. The case has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Guo Xiangzu opened the court for further hearing. The two witnesses, Fang Chen and Liu Wu, both complied with the summons and appeared in court. According to Fang Chen, the child was born to Zhou and Zhang in Xinglongfang, Danshui Road. In August of that year, he attended the baby's first-month party. In December, he heard Zhang say that she had married and the child was sent to the countryside, with Zhou responsible for living expenses. In July of this year, he still saw Zhou giving money to Zhang. The amount was unknown. Liu Wu testified that he had a room in the Qinghefang brothel. In September of that year, Zhou specially brought Zhang to his place, but only for a short time. In December, Zhang married. Zhou once told him that he and Zhang had a child. He knew nothing else. The plaintiff, Zhang Zhuying, then presented a gold ring engraved with the defendant's name and the defendant's given name, saying that it was a love token given by the defendant. The court immediately showed the ring to Zhou and asked if it was a token of love and whether the testimony of the two witnesses was true. Zhou still insisted on denying everything, saying that the testimony of the witnesses was not credible and that the gold ring was not given by him. He requested that the plaintiff's current husband be summoned to court to investigate who Dayuan was born to. The plaintiff's lawyer applied to have the defendant released on bail, saying that the defendant was addicted to smoking and feared that the case would be established, making it difficult to bear criminal responsibility. Recently, it was heard that he intended to leave the area before the verdict. If this were to happen, execution would be difficult. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be released on bail. Judge Wu ruled that the defendant had appeared in court twice and did not need to be released on bail, and ordered that witnesses be summoned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>Inspects Rickshaws Operating in the Special District</p>
<p>1,254 Vehicles Fail to Meet Standards</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, considering that there were many dilapidated rickshaws operating in the Special District, which were detrimental to public health and the safety of travelers, and that citizens and foreigners alike were complaining, decided to conduct an inspection.

A total of 9,990 rickshaws operating in the Special District were inspected (the original number of rickshaws operating in the Special District was 10,000, but the Municipal Council of the Special District revoked the licenses of 10 rickshaws, resulting in a shortage of 10 vehicles). Among them, 1,254 vehicles failed to meet the standards. In terms of all vehicles, most had tattered canopies, followed by those with supporting iron that was too long, too short, or weak. As for the body, only a few had been rebuilt as new cars. As for those with various parts of the body that were old and tattered, requiring repairs, the number reached 525. There were also many with loose and skewed springs. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities conducted this inspection for two months, completing it on January 6th of this year.</p>

<h3>Exquisite</h3>
<p>Aviation Brand Thermos Bottles Made in China</p>
<p>Warmly Welcomed by Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>The Samsung Thermos Bottle Factory in Shanghai is a pioneer in the domestic thermos bottle industry. It was jointly founded by Mr. Meng, who returned from overseas, and Mr. Xia Tingrong and Mr. Lin Baofa, wealthy merchants from Dinghai in Shanghai. The manufacturing plant is located on Baole'an Road, and the distribution office is located in Changkang Lane, Alabaster Road. Since its establishment seven years ago, the Samsung brand of various hot and cold water bottles has won considerable praise from all sectors of society. However, Mr. Meng and others are not satisfied and are conducting in-depth research on exports, hoping to add a unique touch to the domestic goods industry and eliminate foreign goods invisibly. Recently, considering that saving the country through aviation is the only major policy for China today, and in order to awaken the nation to unanimously support its realization, they have spared no expense to hire excellent teachers and carefully craft a variety of Aviation brand water bottles. Not only is the temperature accurate and the style exquisite, but the quality is also solid, surpassing foreign products in every aspect. Therefore, since its launch, it has been widely known and warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Orders have poured in, and there has been almost a shortage of supply. The huge sales volume has truly opened a new record for the domestic thermos bottle industry. It is heard that in order to prevent counterfeit products from appearing on the market, the factory has obtained special registration with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and has obtained the exclusive right to use the trademark.</p>

<h3>Fire at a Shanghai West Store</h3>
<p>At 2:10 a.m. yesterday, the Yongfeng North Goods Store, located at No. 313-315 Jixifeier Road, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons.

Chen Xuxu, the second son of Chen Zikun, the owner of the Dacheng Pawnshop on Second Road in the Public Concession, suffered from a heart condition several months ago. The illness was very serious and the condition was very dangerous. He was treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors in Shanghai, but to no avail. Later, Dr. Yan Boquan of the Chaozhou Heji Hospital in Honganfang, Luban Road, French Concession, carefully diagnosed and treated him, and he recovered after a month. Now he is unusually strong. He himself also had a stomach pain condition, which recently worsened. He could not eat any food and was dangerously thin. He was also treated by the doctor with injections and medicine, and his diet increased day by day. Now he has fully recovered and is better than before. In order to express his gratitude, he specially made a huge plaque with the words "Exquisite Medical Skills" and sent it to the hospital yesterday, along with Western music.

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the Editor: After reviewing the news column of your newspaper on the 7th, which was headlined "Deng Darong Admits to Embezzlement and Misappropriation" and its content, it stated that the defendant admitted without hesitation to the points of embezzlement alleged by the plaintiff and the amount of misappropriation. This is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The defendant Deng Darong has appointed this lawyer as his defense counsel. I have a relatively close hearing of Deng Darong's statement. According to Deng Darong's statement, he only admitted to forging seals and defrauding funds from the Central Bank without hesitation, and did not admit to embezzlement. Although this should also be considered a criminal act, the legal penalties are very different. For the sake of the defendant's interests, I hereby request your newspaper to make a correction to avoid confusing the public. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Siji, February 7th.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>On Learning Languages ​​(Continued 2)</h3>
<p>The letter says: "I hope to be able to understand all the ancient books," so we also disagree with memorizing ancient texts. Because my country's ancient books are vast and complex, and still need to be sorted out, beginners cannot read them, cannot finish reading them, and will become more confused as they read, so how can this help our actual lives? This is one reason. Second, the reasons for not understanding an ancient book can be roughly divided into two types: one is the lack of understanding of the text (reading ancient books requires not only understanding the organization and syntax of the article, but also studying the meanings of words and phrases), and the other is the lack of understanding of the content (such as philosophical and classical meanings). To understand ancient books, one must first seek to understand the text, but it is not uncommon for the text to be clear sentence by sentence, but the content of the article is completely incomprehensible. Therefore, reading ancient books requires more than just understanding the text; the cultivation of other knowledge is also necessary. For example, if you cannot understand new poems, it is probably not because you do not understand the sentences, because the sentences in new poems in "modern times" are not so strange. The main reason is probably that you cannot understand the "meaning" or "consciousness" contained in this type of poem. One era has the consciousness of that era, which is a natural principle. And words and language are tools for expressing consciousness. Once consciousness changes, the tools must also change—old tools cannot express new consciousness. This is not only the case in terms of word usage, but also in terms of article organization and expression. Yan Jidao used ancient Chinese to translate "The Wealth of Nations," and his ancient Chinese skills were very good, but he still felt constrained. For the sake of the text, he changed or altered many of the original meanings of "The Wealth of Nations," and could not express them very accurately and freely.</p>
<p>We have discussed a lot in principle, and now we will answer the five questions you asked:</p>
<p>(1) This is not a problem. Judging from the letter you wrote, although the article cannot be said to be very good, it is also very smooth, so your wish is not extravagant.</p>
<p>(2) Opinions differ on reading materials for beginners in ancient Chinese. We believe that Yao Nai's "Ancient Chinese Prose Lexicon" can also be used as reading material. But it is best to read dozens of carefully selected articles from "Kaiming" and "Beixin" by heart, and the foundation of ancient Chinese will be sufficient. As for advanced studies, one must trace back to the "Masters" and the "Two Hans"; "Master History and Classics." However, you really should not waste this energy today.</p>
<p>(3) We cannot determine which type of writing you should do. It depends on your own wishes, or which type of article you are willing to write. However, in the beginning, you should write more narrative prose, preferably in vernacular Chinese. Because this is the foundation of writing.</p>
<p>(4) We do not know the details of the Commercial Press Correspondence School. You can ask it for a copy of its charter and ask people who are familiar with its content.</p>
<p>(5) We cannot answer this question, because we do not know what kind of books you want to read. However, in our opinion, modern Chinese youth, regardless of their wishes, should read some books on social science common sense. Because humans are social animals, we must have a correct understanding of this society in order to adapt and survive.</p>
<p>In short: We have two fundamental propositions on studying languages, namely (1) we should read modern texts and (2) we should also strive to expand our knowledge. Because understanding modern texts is in line with actual life, and it will not take much effort to read ancient texts and ancient books in the future. Or it may be easier than starting with ancient texts. All learning requires going from shallow to deep, and the things that are closer to our living environment make us feel more interested, so no matter what subject the reader is reading, we advocate that he start with modern times. Expanding knowledge is even more necessary, because now many people cannot write, and they often think that it is because the words cannot express their meaning. In fact, most of them do not have systematic thoughts, in other words, they have nothing to express. A so-called article is an expression of an organized thought, and naturally fragmented and trivial ideas cannot make an article. Therefore, even a person with good writing skills, such as a essayist, cannot write an economics article (if he has no knowledge of economics at all). Even if he does, it will certainly not be a good article, because the goodness of an article does not depend solely on the goodness of the sentences and rhetoric!</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that all those who study writing will not forget the principle that writing is a tool for conveying thoughts. A poor foundation in writing certainly lacks a means of expressing one's opinions; but having the skills of a tool without the tempering of thought cannot produce a good article.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Pseudo</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The lead type in the typesetting room is also changing with the surging tide. The words "Feng Zhang" and "Re Tang", which used to be connected into articles and occupied an important position on the first page of the newspaper, have now become historical terms and will no longer be found in the newspaper! In the past, the word "pseudo," which was not often used in the typesetting room, is now very busy. There is no day in the headlines that this word "pseudo" does not show up and show its face; however, the more the word "pseudo" appears in the newspaper, the more unstable the situation feels, and the general newspaper readers feel more and more headache and a variety of indescribable pain!</p>
<p>The pseudo-country outside the pass has been playing a puppet show for two years; recently, it has intensified, and it will be transformed from the pseudo-Manchukuo to the pseudo-Manchu Empire; from the pseudo-ruler to the pseudo-emperor; from the pseudo-Datong reign to the pseudo-Yi reign; therefore, there are related pseudo-provincial systems, pseudo-official positions, and pseudo-declarations, as well as all kinds of pseudo-things; one pseudo after another has been very troublesome for the typesetter, and it does not stop there.</p>
<p>The pseudo- outside the pass is causing a lot of trouble; in the communist areas inside the pass, there are pseudo-governments, pseudo-military division commanders, and all kinds of pseudo-terms appearing; the pseudo- in the communist areas has not yet been completely washed away, and in the Minbian incident, a large number of pseudo-things were produced; the Minbian has been put down, and Sun Dianying has a rumor of organizing a pseudo-Ningxia provincial government; the typesetter has just removed the words pseudo-people's government, and the words pseudo-Ningxia provincial government will replace it! Why is it that the word "pseudo" is so popular in the newspaper?</p>
<p>If this trend continues, the word "pseudo" in the typesetting room will inevitably "demand more than supply" and feel a shortage; it will be necessary to add more "pseudo" characters! It will be necessary to melt down the lead type that was often used in the past but is not often used now, and recast a large number of "pseudo" characters! Although we common people should not be too pessimistic about the situation, we should cling to optimism in the midst of the unoptimistic. What kind of optimism? I only hope that the word "pseudo" in the typesetting room will henceforth be "supply more than demand" rather than "demand more than supply," which is the optimism of us common people.</p>
<h3>Casual Notes on Wooden Clogs</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Travelers have been away from home for a long time, and the teacher's term is very short. For ten years, I have not been able to visit my ancestral tomb, and my heart is full of shame. In winter, I received a report from a fellow clan member that the tomb path of Dai in Weiting was shrouded in mist, and the descendants had neglected to sweep it for many years. Some bad people had risen up and cut down ancient trees and stolen tomb fields. I was greatly frightened when I heard this. Although I had to deal with affairs in Shanghai and the vacation was short, I had to take a day off to invite my two uncles, Ding and Kun, my brother Chongwei, and my wife Fuji to brave the wind and snow, take a small boat, and sail to Jinji. The wind was strong and the sails were broken, and we were in danger. I recalled that I used to accompany my late father, visiting once a year, in a light boat, the water was calm, the shadows were dim in the third or fourth month of spring and the eighth or ninth month of autumn, the weather was clear and warm, and the wind was warm. Now it is very different. Moreover, in the fragrance of water and clouds, there is something worth savoring. The uncles and aunts sang and responded to each other, and the atmosphere was full of interest. Although I was young at the time, I also knew to listen quietly, and I learned a lot of new things. How could I have expected that the wonderful gathering would not last long, and that I would only be able to pursue it today? Now, the trees on my late father's tomb have grown, and some of my uncles and aunts are disabled due to illness, or have encountered obstacles and cannot return. My third and fourth cousins have passed away one after another. Thinking of this, how can I not secretly want to cry? There is a saying that there is a small change in five years and a big change in ten years, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>Yangcheng is vast and boundless, with sails dotted everywhere, and distant trees form smoke. It is the place of origin of the hairless crabs, which are famous far and wide. To the right is Jinji Lake, which is the main road to Wei. I have heard from the elders that in the late Yuan Dynasty, Jin Wushu was defeated and trapped here. The water army had thousands of people and was about to run out of food. They were surrounded by enemies on all sides, afraid of the pursuing soldiers, and had no way to resist the battle. They would definitely be defeated, and they would die if they defended. There was no way to escape. In desperation, he made an agreement with the water army that if they could dig a huge lake overnight and release the boat to run to Taihu Lake, they would have a chance to live, otherwise they would die together. Everyone followed his advice. At dusk, the soldiers each held a dustpan and worked together. By the time King Guhu was completed, they were able to escape. Later generations named it Jinji. It is a mistake to call it Jinji now.</p>
<p>Jinji is connected to the Shahe pond, and it is a convenient route to Taihu Lake. The area of the Shahe pond is vast, the water color is yellow and turbid, and there are waves as high as a foot, which makes it difficult for boats to travel. The Suzhou gentry Lü Gong spent private money to hire stonemasons to build a stone embankment in the Jinji Shahe pond to isolate it, which slightly reduced the water势. The embankment is thousands of feet long, solid and outstanding, and has remained intact for hundreds of years. People appreciate it. They built a monument to Lü Gong in front of the embankment to praise his great virtue, and named the embankment Lü Gong Embankment.</p>
<p>Bamboo fences and thatched huts, the sounds of chickens and dogs, are the joy of the farming family; the clear water mirror, a flat boat and fishing, are the joy of the fishing family. After traveling in the countryside, I often think of buying a few acres of land, building a few houses, and reading and practicing quietness in between, without honor or disgrace, and without competing with the world. Is this the peach garden of the people who avoided Qin? I will seek it in my dreams.</p>
<h3>Bad Play</h3>
<p>— Zhu Sizhong</p>
<p>A burst of erhu music was blown over by the gentle breeze, followed by the Beijing tune that sounded like a broken bamboo tube throat. Oh! What is this? I opened my legs and ran over to take a look, only to find that it was an old couple from Jiangbei, performing their bad play at the corner of the Chen's house.</p>
<p>The man put on a beard like a tassel of corn silk and wore an embroidered hat that no one wanted to exchange for candy. The woman also wore a flowered hat found in the trash can. One pulled, one sang, the man sometimes picked up a tree knife with the tin foil peeled off and danced wildly in the air, chanting in his mouth...Qi Bei...Qi Qi Bei.... This is probably their economic method, because hiring an extra handyman would of course cost more, so they only asked Qingzuier to help, acting as a percussionist, anyway, everything is for him.</p>
<p>"Shameless things, only Jiangbei people can do this kind of ugly trick." An old man with gray hair, holding a water pipe, walked over, puffing and puffing, and said this when he saw it.</p>
<p>"Qiaodi! Let's go, I'm afraid they'll be collecting money in a while." A taller girl gently patted the shoulder of a shorter girl and said this, and then they left together.</p>
<p>"Please help, it's hard for people to go out, please give me a little reward." The Jiangbei woman wearing a flowered hat held a broken wooden plate and collected money from the audience. However, the general audience looked at each other, some wished they could escape, and some stretched out a hand into their pocket, but couldn't get it out for a long time. After the woman repeatedly begged, for a full half an hour, she still couldn't collect two or three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>The old Jiangbei couple, sighed a few times, and threw the broken hats in the broken basket and walked away dejectedly.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Fourth</p>
<p>Drinking Wine and Passing Food, Merry Partying, Containing Farewell Tears</p>
<p>Picking up the Lamp and Warming the Dream, Singing Softly, Passing the Long Night</p>
<p>He smiled and said, I just discussed with my mother that we should have a farewell party for you. Ziqiang laughed: What a joke, we're family, what farewell party? And I'll be picking you up to Qian'an soon. I've heard that our army will be transferred back from Xifengkou and stationed in Qian'an County. Guizhi walked closer, holding the corner of the table with one hand, looking at him, smiling slightly: You've said these two sentences more than twenty times. Ziqiang laughed: Really? I don't feel like it. Guizhi took another step closer, leaned against him, and looked at his face: What do you want to eat? Bao Jiao (pronounced dumplings), Chang Mian, fried meat pies, I can make them all. I'll make something for you to eat today as a farewell party. Zhao Ziqiang took Guizhi's hand and gently pressed his hand against his face, then tilted his head and looked at him: Are you not sad? Guizhi smiled: Do you think I'm a child and don't understand anything? We should be happy during our honeymoon, what's the point of being sad? Ziqiang said: What about your old lady? Guizhi smiled: My old lady is even more sensible than me, what's the point of being sad? Tell me, do you want to eat dumplings or meat pies? As she spoke, she held Ziqiang's two hands and shook them a few times. Ziqiang stood up, pressed her shoulders with his hands, and then smiled, as long as you make it, everything is delicious. Guizhi leaned into his arms and reached out to stroke his face: I'll make lamb and cabbage filling pancakes for you, okay? Ziqiang said: Good, but it's too much trouble. Guizhi said: No, I have to make filling pancakes for you to eat. Ziqiang said: Why do you have to make filling pancakes for me? Guizhi smiled and said, There is a saying that filling pancakes will not fall from the sky, probably filling pancakes are the best things. I'll make filling pancakes for you to eat today, so you can have a good sign. Ziqiang laughed loudly, and the couple had a great time in the room. (241)</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Winter Solstice Pure Offerings</h3>
<p>— Holding to the Buddha</p>
<p>Spring days are filled with blossoming flowers and trees, while winter days are frigid, with all trees withered and fallen. However, maples and nanmu trees, having endured frost, adorn the snow with their red leaves, resembling spring flowers. Moreover, there are still a few old trees and several pots of winter plants, uniquely outstanding, bravely competing in beauty against the cold. Are they not winter month beauties and snow-bound gorgeous ladies? Hiding them in the warm room and displaying them in the study is truly a delightful companion amidst the bitter cold.</p>
<p>(1) Narcissus is a renowned flower in spring bonsai, with a graceful and elegant bearing, its delicate veins conveying affection. It only needs to be planted in a water jar, accompanied by clear, pure pebbles, without the need for filthy soil or foul fertilizer. It truly possesses a noble character unmatched by other plants. The ethereal goddess of the Luo River, the Han woman who unfastened her jade pendant, and the Xiang River goddess descending upon the shore are all reflections of its image. It is a perennial herb with green, slender leaves with parallel veins, and its underground stem is bulbous. As mentioned in the "Comprehensive Flora," "the root resembles a garlic bulb," which refers to the underground stem. Several flowers bloom at the top of the stem, as large as hairpin heads, botanically called umbel flowers. They are mostly white, with a separate yellow cup-shaped corona. Sun Qi's poem states, "Vanishing all icy hearts, a hint of pink." This shows its simple yet charming and cold beauty. Huang Shangu's poem states, "Containing fragrance, pure of form, about to captivate the city; the mountain alnus is its younger brother, and the plum is its elder brother." Because it blooms after the plum blossoms, it allows the plum to be the elder brother. In the past, Emperor Tang Minghuang gifted his third concubine, Lady Guo of Guo, with twelve pots of red narcissus, the pots made of gold, jade, and seven treasures. This was not only showing favor to Lady Guo but also affection for the narcissus. A Tang dynasty poem states, "Lady Guo received the Emperor's grace, riding into the palace gate at dawn; the earth disdained the rouge and powder that stained her color, she lightly swept her eyebrows to face the Emperor." It turns out that Lady Guo was a narcissus flower.</p>
<p>(2) Winter sweet was originally called "Yellow Plum," but it is not a species of plum. Because its flowers bloom similarly to red plums in shape and fragrance, it is called winter sweet. It is also not because it blooms in the twelfth lunar month, but because its petals resemble wax twists, so it is called "wax plum." Winter sweet is prized for its fragrance. Huang Shangu's poem states, "The body is perfumed with mountain umbilical cord, the color dyed with rose dew." Han Zicang's poem states, "Entering your house, a hundred steps of fragrance, glimpsed through the curtains, a first attempt at Han Palace makeup, one suspects dreaming of Zhaoyang Palace, a cluster of light red amidst pale yellow." The "Comprehensive Flora" states, "The fragrance of winter sweet can only be smelled from afar, not from close." It turns out that its fragrance is too strong, which is harmful to the brain. Inserting winter sweet into a gallbladder vase and displaying it on the desk, with the light dots of wax pellets and the rich fragrance of plum, is truly a fine winter offering.</p>
<p>(3) Heavenly bamboo is an evergreen shrub, often planted in gardens. The stems are smooth and delicate; the leaves are pinnately compound; the flower axis grows at the top of the stem. Small white flowers bloom in summer with five petals, and the fruits resemble sunflower seeds, turning red in autumn and winter, like beads, very beautiful. Planting heavenly bamboo in pots or gallbladder vases to adorn the furnishings of a small study is very elegant, is it not?</p>
<p>(4) Plum blossoms bloom before all other flowers and are the first to bloom in the new year. People appreciate their "color" and "fragrance"! Therefore, they have always been popular. Lin Hejing regarded it as his wife, which shows Mr. Lin's fondness. "Sparse shadows slant across the clear, shallow water; a subtle fragrance floats in the twilight moon" are also famous lines by Mr. Lin. Du Gongbu's poem states, "Walking around the eaves, I seek to laugh with the plum blossoms; the cold buds and sparse branches can barely endure." Besides red and white, there is also a type of plum blossom called "green calyx," which is mentioned in the "Stone Lake Plum Blossom Catalogue," saying that pure green plum blossoms are called "green calyx." In fact, white plum blossoms have a slight green tint when they bloom, so they are called "green calyx plum." The ancients valued horizontal, sparse, old branches, and strange forms. Nowadays, bonsai plum blossoms are twisted and sparse, possessing beauty but not from nature, so they cannot be called noble. The Book of Song says, "Emperor Wu's daughter, Princess Shouyang, was sleeping under the eaves of Hanzhang Hall. Plum blossoms fell on the princess's forehead, forming five petals that could not be brushed away. The Empress kept them. Since then, there has been 'plum blossom makeup.'" This story is very charming, and we need not concern ourselves with whether it is mythical or not. There is another myth that is also very fragrant and beautiful. Longcheng Record states, "During the Kaihuang era of the Sui Dynasty, Zhao Shixiong was traveling in Luofu. At dusk, he saw a beauty in light makeup and plain clothes welcoming him by an inn beside a forest. Shixiong spoke with her, and her words were extremely clear and beautiful, with a fragrant scent. He went to the inn with her to drink, and a green-clad boy danced by their side. Shixiong fell asleep drunk. After a long time, the east was already white. He got up and saw that he was under a large plum blossom tree, with green feathers chirping on it, the moon setting and the stars scattered. He was only filled with regret!" Looking at this myth, Zhao Shixiong seems far inferior to the reclusive Mr. Lin. Are the "understanding flowers" all superior to others?</p>

<h3>Housewives and Preparing for the New Year</h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>The unbreakable habit, the annual Lunar New Year's Eve, is once again upon us. Although this Lunar New Year has nothing to say about value, it has a profound relationship with the promotion of domestic goods, especially since this responsibility rests in the hands of the housewives of each family.</p>
<p>Recently, the busiest people in society, apart from general stores that do business, are the housewives in households. If you have the time, please pay attention to the shops on the streets. Among the customers, seven or eight out of ten are ladies and grandmothers who come to prepare for the New Year. Occasionally, some servants come to patronize, but they also come at the command of the ladies and grandmothers. Why do they come to patronize? It is to prepare for the New Year. New Year goods are a general term. Analyzed, there are about four types:</p>
<p>(1) Those prepared for personal use during the New Year. Such as thanking the gods for the year, celebrating the festival, worshiping ancestors, and hanging portraits.</p>
<p>(2) Those for entertainment during the New Year. Things for children to wear and eat, things for children to play with, and entertainment for family members themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Those for gift-giving. Close relatives and friends give gifts to each other, seemingly following etiquette and being unable to avoid customs.</p>
<p>(4) Taking advantage of this New Year, discarding old items and buying new supplies to signify a fresh start. These four types include things to eat, wear, live in, and everything used and played with. Therefore, housewives are extremely busy. However, before housewives prepare for the New Year, I want to say a few words impolitely. Since you already know that this year is the Year of National Goods for Women, then when purchasing New Year goods, be sure to pay attention to whether the New Year goods you buy are domestic goods? Are there things from foreign countries? I want to advise you to pay close attention, choose carefully, and you must know:</p>
<p>(1) Buying foreign goods for your own use is the most undignified thing to do.</p>
<p>(2) Buying foreign goods for children to eat is the most inappropriate education.</p>
<p>(3) Buying foreign goods to give to relatives and friends is looking down on relatives and friends, and despising their personality.</p>
<p>(4) Buying foreign goods for decoration is making yourself ugly and will inevitably be despised by relatives and friends.</p>
<p>(5) Buying foreign goods to entertain guests is despising guests and lowering their status (entertaining guests with foreign cigarettes and foreign alcohol is the most unaspiring thing to do).</p>
<p>I hope that wise housewives and gentlemen who love their housewives will, during this time of preparing for the New Year, just put in some effort, make a wish, patronize domestic goods factories and domestic goods companies as much as possible, hold on to the mentality of not buying anything but domestic goods, and persuade their husbands, who in turn encourage their wives. Only then will Chinese domestic goods have a chance to succeed, and foreign goods will have a hope of disappearing. I do not want to see the following two dishonorable and unlucky news items again:</p>
<p>(1) International Trade Bureau Report: Last year, the import quantity of cosmetics in Shanghai reached 1.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) International Trade Bureau Report: Last year, the import quantity of foreign cigarettes and foreign alcohol had a total value of over 10 million gold yuan, with Shanghai's consumption accounting for one-third.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Dumping of Enemy Goods During the Year of National Goods for Women</h3>
<p>— Huang Xuanwan</p>
<p>From the past of history, we can examine and review that the problem of "dumping of enemy goods" has long become the most painful page in our modern history, and its seriousness is only increasing and deepening, without any chance of resolution. Although in the middle, there was still a small change, because of the national crises of "September 18th" and "January 28th", it prompted the vigorous development of our boycott of goods movement, which was able to slightly restrain its traces. However, the cunning Japanese are not willing to give up, letting go of this piece of fat meat without firmly cutting it. Simply drooling is useless, so they will "deliberately plan", they will "rise from the ashes", they are both "colluding with unscrupulous merchants and recklessly dumping" and "disguising themselves and deceiving the people". As a result, in the end, we failed again. According to customs reports, the huge number of enemy goods imported last year was over 200 million yuan, and the four northeastern provinces under its threat are not included. The hateful enemy showed a hideous smile, but when we looked back at our domestic goods industry, the enthusiastic hope was shattered by the painful reality. However, starting from this year - the beginning of the Year of National Goods for Women, this is unanimously acknowledged by the public, and it is the most serious transition period for our domestic goods industry. What we expect from it is great and huge. However, the first voice at the beginning, when the sound of the "Year of National Goods for Women" really filled the country, the remnant sound of this "dumping of enemy goods" rose up again, separated by a distance. The prominent headline on the newspaper, "Dumping of Enemy Goods in North China is Getting Worse", they are also using organized and planned strategies to carry out large-scale dumping, and at the same time, enemy goods are becoming more and more enthusiastic throughout the country, which really has the feeling of "the mountain rain is about to come and the wind is filling the building". What is even more ridiculous is that recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, in his foreign policy statement, even expressed his coordination with China. Undoubtedly, this is another cunning means of his, a prelude to dumping during the opportunity. "Sima Zhao's heart is known to everyone", this is not surprising.</p>
<p>So, in this bleak charcoal painting, can we not deeply feel that the performance of this painful fact is really because our old people are too uncompetitive, and the future of the domestic goods industry is even more full of thorns and hidden reefs. This serious situation is waiting for us to open up and deal with. In my humble opinion, the measure to deal with the symptoms should pay attention to the implementation of the following two items:</p>
<p>1. Special Commissioners Investigate and Conduct On-site Propaganda: Domestic goods manufacturers should urgently send special commissioners to various places to conduct detailed investigations into the truth of enemy goods dumping, and conduct on-site propaganda, in order to awaken the people and make domestic goods have a trend of expansion.</p>
<p>2. Quickly Impose Dumping Tax: Imperialists originally took my country's low and light tariffs as the initial convenience for dumping. However, at this time, our authorities should urgently and strictly impose dumping taxes to show resistance and to give domestic goods protection.</p>
<p>As for the fundamental problem, naturally, as long as all the people of the country are unanimously mobilized to "regard enemy goods as floods and fierce beasts, and firmly refuse", then the rampant enemy goods, I think one day will be silenced and disappeared by the voice of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>The Real Modern Woman</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Modern woman, what a beautiful term. All women want to be modern women, who doesn't want to be a modern woman, everyone takes being a modern woman as an honor, and being called a modern woman is the ultimate glory. Modern woman! You are truly an enviable term!</p>
<p>What is a modern woman? How can one be worthy of being called a modern woman? According to what most people say, a modern woman must wear foreign goods, wear foreign socks and foreign shoes, have a foreign hairstyle, and everything must use foreign goods. Such a woman is a modern woman. In fact, this kind of behavior and this kind of concept are really a big mistake. In this Year of National Goods for Women, we must stand up and correct it.</p>
<p>In recent years, the decline of our Chinese national power and the economic depression of society are facts that no one can deny. There are certainly many reasons for this, but the economic aggression of imperialists is one of the main reasons. According to a report from the International Trade Bureau last year, the total trade deficit for the year was about 900 million yuan. Ah! This "900 million yuan" is such an alarming number! On average, each of us had to contribute two yuan to foreigners last year alone. Readers, try to close your eyes and think, can you not feel pain? Can you ignore it indifferently? In this 900 million yuan trade deficit, we can boldly say that women are responsible for six or seven tenths of it. Therefore, it has a very deep and painful meaning that this year is officially designated as the Year of National Goods for Women!</p>
<p>Women, stand up! In this Year of National Goods for Women, we must work hard to correct all the mistakes of the past, especially the psychology of worshiping foreign goods and using foreign goods as modern women, and we must fundamentally eradicate it. In this year, those who can implement the following articles are the real modern women.</p>
<p>(1) Do not say that foreign goods are good, (2) Do not buy foreign goods, (3) Use domestic goods and local goods, (4) Help the production of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Paintings with National Salvation Significance</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, while the reporter was passing by Penglai Road in Xiaoximen, he saw dozens of people surrounding and watching in front of the northern window of the China Enamel Factory in the northern part of Penglai Market. I was deeply surprised, and also pushed into the crowd, and saw that the new layout of the January 28th commemorative advertisement in the window was far-reaching in its intention, which was enough to show that the manager of the factory, Mr. Fang Jiange, had a vision superior to others. No wonder his fellow villagers (Nanxiang) all gave him the nickname "Iron Abacus". (It is said that no matter what happens, after he calculates it, there will be no mistakes, admiring his shrewdness and ability.) I will introduce what I saw as follows for reference. It is also what the comrades who care about national affairs and promote national goods want to hear. On the wall are five white-ground black-bordered slogans, one foot wide and two feet long, one says "Remember January 28th and be determined to use domestic goods", the second says "What is good about foreign goods, money is exchanged for guns and cannons" The third says "Promoting domestic goods is the responsibility of the national people", the fourth says "Lihe brand washbasin is the most perfect domestic product", the fifth says "Please use domestic goods to show patriotism" There are two red hearts painted on the corners, with fresh blood dripping from under the heart, there are armed soldiers holding guns and advancing, their words are simple and clear, and they are very eye-catching. Below, the wooden boards are painted with red paint, like the walls of a foreign house, which are incomplete. There are still several roots of burnt wood and scattered debris inside the wall. A soldier held a gun and moved forward along the wall, his eyes flashing, paying attention to the front. There was an anti-aircraft gun on the side of the wall, with the factory's rice bowl covers and the like as a shelf, and two hot water bottles connected as the gun barrel. Behind it, a soldier knelt next to the gun mount to aim. In front was a Chinese tank, about three feet long, with a rice bowl as the top, a tea jar as the lamp, and a top bowl basket cover as the wheel, with a small flag hanging on it, which was very lifelike. There was a Japanese plane hanging in the air. In the center, a fortress was stacked with spittoons. Outside the fortress, Chinese and Japanese soldiers were fighting hand-to-hand, with blood flowing like a stream. At first glance, it was completely a tragic picture of Zhabei. The audience deeply hated the enemy's ferocity, and sighed that our country's authorities were only singing the slogan of recovering lost land, and for the ravaged land, it was still broken walls and ruins, and let it be desolate. I hope to quickly practice the four characters of spiritual unity to work hard against foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Opening Chapter of the Year of National Goods for Women</h3>
<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>Alas, my China's situation is already in danger, the tragedy of national subjugation is in sight: there is no other way to turn weakness into strength, promoting domestic goods is effective and proven. (As the saying goes) The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone, and we must unite together. The Chamber of Commerce of this city saw this and tirelessly persuaded, and stipulated this Year of National Goods for Women. From now on, I advise female compatriots to take the lead in using domestic goods, (because) although foreign goods feel beautiful on the outside, embroidered pillows are ridiculed for what beauty they have? (Moreover) domestic goods have made a lot of progress in recent years, they are simple, durable and cheap. Using domestic goods to recover rights is no different from resisting the enemy and winning a triumphant return? (If you can) often advise among relatives and friends, plugging leaks is even more difficult! Virtuous wife and good mother model, family harmony is truly admirable, (and) plant melons and get melons, children are virtuous, saving money and loving the country, what is not happy about it and what needs to be said. It is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep, and it is between fingers to raise our eyebrows and breathe easily. Relying on young women to save the world!</p>
<h3>Up and Down, Ancient and Modern</h3>
<p>— Qiacheng</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Promoting domestic goods is not about talking more, but only about acting vigorously! Some say it is a year of slogans, some say it is a year of catchphrases, but we don't have to argue with people's ambitions, practical results are better than eloquent arguments, who dares to deny the real achievements. Ladies and misses, are you right?</p>
<p>(2) Reviving the National Spirit</p>
<p>Because of frequent foreign troubles, the objective environment makes us determine that we need to revive our national spirit, but national self-confidence is absolutely necessary. Although we don't have to have thoughts of arrogant self-importance, we must at least not be superstitious about others.</p>
<p>(3) Please See It This Way</p>
<p>Some people misunderstand that using domestic goods is not modern. In fact, modern is just a concept for everyone! If you think this is modern, he thinks this is also modern, fortunately there is no written law, and the expectations of the public will not succeed?</p>
<p>(4) Treat Domestic Goods as Children</p>
<p>Sons are one's own good, regardless of gender, and the same feeling is shared. Dr. Ge Chenghui humorously said that pure domestic goods are just some little treasures: I hope that ladies will treat domestic goods as children, and under the supervision of these many nannies, they will achieve great development.</p>
<p>(5) Just Seek to Be Clear of My Conscience</p>
<p>Confucius discussed filial piety and said that it is all about exerting one's heart! In this Year of National Goods for Women, ladies and grandmothers may feel that their duties are not light, and there are bound to be places of panic. In fact, the only principle is that everyone is clear of their conscience, exerting as much effort as they can, and it is already immeasurable merit.</p>

<h3>Pan Zhuqi Travels the World to Study Education</h3>
<p>▲First to Italy, then to Soviet Russia</p>
<p>▲Expected to Return Home in About a Year</p>
<p>Pan Zhuqi, former director of education and construction in Guangxi Province and current president of Guangxi University and the Agricultural College, was recently ordered by the provincial government to travel the world to study industrial education. He recently arrived in Shanghai and informed us in detail about the recent situation in Guangxi and his itinerary. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the University</p>
<p>Guangxi University was founded in 1928 and currently has more than 600 students. It was suspended for two years due to the 1929 political upheaval and was restored in 1931. Initially, it established three colleges of science, agriculture, and engineering. The president concurrently serves as the dean of the College of Engineering, and Mr. Pan concurrently serves as the dean of the College of Agriculture. Ma Minghai concurrently serves as the dean of the College of Science. The professors hired are all well-known scholars of the time, and they pay special attention to students' extracurricular activities. The equipment is comprehensive, and the education is excellent, deeply trusted by the Department of Education, and it is indeed the only perfect institution of higher learning in the southwest of our country.</p>
<p>Socializing in Beijing</p>
<p>After being ordered by the provincial government to go to various countries for inspection, Mr. Pan arrived in Shanghai by sea. Due to applying for a passport to go abroad, he made a special trip to Beijing a few days ago and met with Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov. Bogomolov expressed his welcome to Mr. Pan's visit to the country to inspect industries and was introduced by Consul General Spier to several letters of introduction to allow him to delve into the country for on-the-spot investigation. Since Mr. Pan will spend a longer time in Russia, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth investigation of the success of the Soviet Five-Year Plan and the substantial progress in industry. Mr. Pan also intends to conduct an accompanying investigation of education in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Itinerary and Dates</p>
<p>It is now scheduled to take the Italian liner Conte Rosso on the ninth of this month and go directly to Italy. After staying for about two weeks, he will go to Germany and then to Denmark in Northern Europe, then through Poland and to Soviet Russia. He will spend a very short time in the United Kingdom, France, Austria, and Switzerland, totaling about five months in Europe and about five months in Russia. He can return home at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Guangxi</p>
<p>During the conversation, Mr. Pan expressed his satisfaction with Guangxi's administration, construction, and education. He said that students in various schools pay special attention to military training. In recent years, the people of Guangxi have assisted the government in burying their heads in construction and ignoring foreign affairs, much like the situation of the Soviet Union's efforts in the Five-Year Plan.</p>
<h3>Teacher Appointment Letters for Municipal Schools</h3>
<p>Must be Issued by the Municipal Bureau of Education</p>
<p>▲Yesterday's Public Notice Informed All Principals and Teachers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued a public notice yesterday, stating that the rules for the appointment and dismissal of teachers in municipal secondary schools and municipal primary schools were revised and promulgated last year. It was also stipulated that after each school plans to hire teachers, it should submit them to the bureau for approval, and the bureau will issue blank appointment letters, fill them out, send them to the bureau for stamping, and return them for transfer. Recently, it has been reported that some primary school principals have hidden the appointment letters issued by the bureau and refused to transfer them, and instead drafted and issued them themselves, which is a violation of laws and regulations. For this reason, this public notice is issued to all principals and teachers of municipal schools. Teacher appointment letters must be obtained using blank appointment letters, filled out, sent to the bureau for stamping, and returned for transfer, so as to show solemnity. This public notice,</p>

<h3>Shanghai Team Selection for Shanghai-Hong Kong-Tianjin Interport Football Announced</h3>
<p>Youyou's Chen Jiaqiu, Sun Jinshun, and Zhong Yongsen All Selected</p>
<p>Divided into Two Teams to Face Tianjin and Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong-Tianjin triangular interport competition will be held in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year. The schedule has been announced, and both the Hong Kong and Tianjin teams have been preparing for a long time and will be leaving for Shanghai in the next few days. The Shanghai team's selection has been decided and announced by the Western Union Football Association after two trial matches. The team will be divided into two teams to face Tianjin and Hong Kong. Only Chen Jiaqiu, Sun Jinshun, and Zhong Yongsen from Youyou will be selected among the Chinese players. Li Ning, Zhou Xianyan, and Dai Linjing from Donghua, who had the highest hopes of being selected, were excluded because they did not attend the second trial match last Sunday. This has some impact on the strength of the Shanghai team. After the Donghua players were absent, the following lineup is still satisfactory despite dissatisfaction. However, because Wassers is restricted by military regulations, only three people can be selected, so Maolin and Smith will only play once and take turns fighting with Zha Xu and Walter. This is why it is necessary to divide into two teams. However, Walter's left wing is far inferior to Maolin, and Zha Xu's central defender is not as good as Smith, so both teams' lineups have some shortcomings. This is also unavoidable. The selected players are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Against the Tianjin Team</p>
<p>Walter (French Business Association)</p>
<p>Turner (West Portuguese Team), Gu Shitan (French Business Association), A Qiao (Wassers)</p>
<p>Fulu Shou (French Business Association), Smith (Wassers), Sun Jinshun (Youyou)</p>
<p>Taolewei (Wassers), Remidi (French Business Association), Chen Jiaqiu (Youyou)</p>
<p>Peida (West Portuguese Team)</p>
<p>▲Against the Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>Maolin (Wassers)</p>
<p>Turner (West Portuguese Team), Gu Shitan (French Business Association), A Qiao (Wassers)</p>
<p>Fulu Shou (French Business Association), Zha Xu (West Portuguese Team), Ke Lai Tuo (French Business Association)</p>
<p>Taolewei (Wassers), Remidi (French Business Association), Chen Jiaqiu (Youyou)</p>
<p>Zhong Yongsen (Youyou)</p>
<p>The above lineup may be changed in the future. The Western Union Association officially announced the Hong Kong team's selection as follows: Goalkeeper Mike Hartle, right inside defender Alan, right inside defender Sturange, right midfielder Liang Rongzhao, central defender Birote, forward Power, right winger Xiao Gaoshan Slave, right inside Tan Jiangbai, center Da Gaoshan Slave, left inside Letley, left winger Huo Queit, reserve players Kirk, Elliott, Lunat, Breton, Zheng Jiliang, manager Guerbert.</p>
<p>▲Hong Kong Team to Go North Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 7th) The Hong Kong-Shanghai interport football team, Hong Kong player Zheng Jiliang, etc., are scheduled to take the postal ship Jinma Beilun to Shanghai on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Billiards Performance, Day Two</h3>
<p>Smith Becomes Even More Deified</p>
<p>Sets a New Shanghai Record of 670 Points</p>
<p>Liu Fuying and Kang Bosi to Appear Tonight</p>
<p>The highest record of 621 points for a professional billiards player in Shanghai, created by Faulkner, was broken by William Smith with 670 points last night. Smith, a world-renowned professional billiards player, has made the Shanghai Chinese and Western ladies who love this sport feel extremely gratified with his first four performances last night. In particular, amateur players have gained a lot of tips, and the Shanghai billiards community has benefited greatly from Smith. There are two more performances today, and the opponents are Chinese and Portuguese amateur players Liu Fuzong and Kang Bosi. The location and time remain the same.</p>
<p>Smith (right) and Li Gongying (left) in a group photo (photographed by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>Shanghai Record</p>
<p>Smith's two performances on the second day yesterday were even better than the first day. The first game had a total of ten shots and scored 922 points, averaging 92.2 points per shot, which seemed beyond the expectations of the audience. The second game had a total of five shots and scored 1009 points, averaging more than 201 points per shot, which directly surprised the audience. The production of the new Shanghai professional record was also in this last fourth shot. Of the fifteen shots before and after, only the fifteenth shot was a blank shot, presumably because he didn't want to do too much in the last shot. Yesterday's highest score was 670, followed by 527, 241, 228, 88, and 54.</p>
<p>Gongying is Great</p>
<p>Li Gongying, the king of billiards in our country, can compete with world-famous professional players and still show his skills without any anxiety, which is commendable. He took a total of eleven shots yesterday, although he did not produce a huge score, but he had a total of 228 points, averaging more than 20 points, which is particularly commendable for him.</p>
<p>Shizhang is Lovable</p>
<p>Xu Shizhang is a promising young man in our country who represented China as the fifth general in last year's Sino-British International Billiards Championship. He played a few shots last night and showed a lot of potential. The experts also praised him for turning danger into safety several times. His highest score was 24, and he scored a total of 56 points in six shots.</p>
<p>Fuzong Takes the Stage</p>
<p>Liu Fuzong was selected to take the stage at 6:00 p.m. today to compete. Mr. Liu was also one of the five generals in last year's Sino-British International Competition. At 9:15 p.m., it will be the Portuguese master Kang Bosi. At the same time, Smith's performance is getting better and better, and it seems that a higher record can be expected today, refreshing the Shanghai billiards world.</p>

<p>Tonight at the Shanghai Basketball Association, Zhanghua will compete against Mailing for the championship of the Second Division. The game will start at 8:30 PM at the Chinese Basketball Hall.

<p>Last night, Tongji and Jianhua were evenly matched and indistinguishable. The absence of Zheng Zhifang and Guan Jinlin had some impact on Jianhua. In the first half, Jianhua took a strong lead with a score of 17 to 8. In the second half, Tongji counterattacked effectively, leading with a score of 23 to 14. The final score was 31 to 31, with no winner. In overtime, Jianhua was like an arrow at the end of its flight, with no progress at all. Tongji was on the rise and scored ten points in a row, thus winning with a score of 41 to 31. Chizhi and Qingguang were also very evenly matched. Chizhi has been performing well recently. In the first half, Qingguang's lineup was not strong due to the absence of Tan Dahua, and Chizhi led all the way, winning with a score of 16 to 13. In the second half, Tan joined Qingguang, and the situation changed, and they eventually won with a score of 35 to 27. The results of the three games yesterday are as follows:</p>

<h3>Jiaoda's Farewell Battle in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Lost to the China United Team</p>
<p>- One to Two -</p>
<p>▲Two Offsides Result in Loss of Good Opportunities</p>
<p>(Tianjin 5th Dispatch) The Shanghai Jiaoda Football Team, after drawing with Beining at the beginning of the month, met the China team again at Nankai Ground yesterday afternoon. The weather was cold that day, but there were still over a thousand spectators. The ground after the snow was cleared and cleaned, but due to freezing, cracks appeared everywhere on the surface. Before the match, the two armies formed teams and tried out their feet. Although one or two players from the Jiaoda team were still not playing, their strength had been strengthened compared to the battle with Beining. Due to the temporary absence of captain Sun Sijing from the Chinese team, all the team members looked forward to him eagerly. Fortunately, Vice Captain Zhang Changyu arrived at the venue early, and the morale had not been greatly reduced. Therefore, Zhao Qichun was temporarily appointed as the central defender for this match.</p>
<p>The Tianjin team launched a fierce attack at 3:00 PM, and referee Wang Zihua blew his whistle, and the two armies faced off on foot and began to move. The Jiaoda team's front army had excellent connections, but the Chinese team's defense was solid, and they were repeatedly frustrated. Before long, China launched a large-scale attack, and Sun Fulai's ball was extremely fierce, but the goal was deflected. Sun Yongquan rushed up and kicked hard, and the ball crossed the door.</p>
<p>First to score, Jiaoda goalkeeper Fan Jiaju used the opportunity to pass the ball forward to Li Beiliang, but Xue Wenxiu's shot was in vain again. China gained momentum again in an instant, and Zhang Ziyu dribbled the ball forward, and the Jiaoda territory became the target of everyone's attention. Under the trampling of thousands of troops, Jiang Lu cleverly obtained the ball and kicked it smoothly, and the ball rushed to the corner of the net.</p>
<p>Tied score After China got this ball, its prestige became even stronger, and it repeatedly invaded the enemy camp with short-range passes. The Jiaoda defense army did its duty, and Wang Chenlian repelled the enemy army. During the battle, China mistakenly committed a handball, and Li Beiliang took the kick. When his foot rose, he passed it directly to the border. Zhou Guangzhong seized the opportunity to kick it again, and the ball went smoothly into the net. Chen Erde turned around and tried to save it, but it was too late. After fighting for a long time, the first half ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Offside pity In the second half, both sides changed generals to respond to the battle, and the battle line changed. After the kickoff, China lost another opportunity. Zhao Qichun echoed back and forth and made a great contribution. Liang Mingzong monitored Wan Xianghua and did not move an inch, which exhausted the young general. The Jiaoda team ran across the entire field, seizing the opportunity to move. Wen Liandong went straight up and attacked the goal urgently, but Jin Adu fell to the ground and caught the ball, and the door was safe again. In an instant, Wan Xianghua had another excellent opportunity to score a goal, but it was a pity that Gong Wenxiu was too eager to advance and was penalized for being offside.</p>
<p>Jiaoda loses Sun Yongquan, the main kicker of the Chinese team, had an excellent landing point. Jiang Lu rushed up and dribbled in, and was surrounded again. Five minutes later, Jiaoda Gong Yibin intercepted the ball shot by Wang Hongrong and quickly kicked the ball, but it worked again, but unfortunately it failed again due to offside. In the last minute, China advanced in unison. Sun Yongquan received the ball passed by Zhang Changyu and took a shot smoothly. It hit the door frame and fell in front of the door. Jiang Lu rushed up and kicked hard, using an excellent posture to win applause again. The game ended in an instant, and Jiaoda lost 1-2. After the battle, Jiaoda team leader Peng Wenyu told reporters that the entire team had set off to return to Shanghai at 10:00 PM last night. Because the team came north a little late and the school will start classes on the 5th, they had to rush back. As for the invitations from friendly teams in various places, it would be difficult to fulfill them. If there is an opportunity in the future, they will come to learn from them again.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Descendants of Prominent Families</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayi</p>
<p>There are only three types of prominent families: First, fathers and grandfathers who read books and became high officials are called prominent families. Their descendants come out refined and elegant, but of extremely high status. They often use a "twist" or say "no," which sweeps everything away. Second, families with military achievements. Although the ancients "disdained taking positions through military merit" or emphasized that "military appearance should not enter the country," that kind of prestige was extremely great among the people. Their descendants dreamed of leading troops into battle, which was extremely terrifying. They could arrest people to be flogged at any time. Third, families that started from business and were also called prominent families were looked down upon by society, but they considered themselves to be in control of society's lifeline. Their descendants felt that anything could be bought. They only asked about the price and exchanged money for it.</p>
<p>Recently, the trend of flogging has decreased. Wealthy young men mostly wear Western suits, and "ladies" also want to be "modern" and walk out on the streets. This is because China has been in a state of "accumulated destruction and misery" for many years and needs equality and freedom.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at these prominent families, there are only two things inside: barbarism and slavery. In addition, there are some bluffs and attractive signs.</p>
<p>These two spirits are consistent and mutually supportive. The master is a slave because there is an emperor above him and masters above him. There are even more slaves and "slaves of slaves" below him. The consistent policy is to bow and scrape, flatter and ingratiate, which leads to incurable corruption and unrestrained barbarism.</p>
<p>Such a smoky atmosphere envelops the "prominent families," making them "concentrated to the point of being inseparable." The children inside, even if they were originally clever, mostly become vulgar, idiotic, or profligate due to the surrounding environment. Even if they occasionally achieve learning and understanding of human affairs because of wise parents, they simply add a large framework and gilded signs to the outside, with the sole purpose of turning commoners who are not from prominent families into even more miserable slaves.</p>
<p>The stratification of classes in China is not yet obvious, but imagine a commoner walking into a prince's mansion, just like a young diplomat entering the International League of Nations for the first time. They may feel at a loss. This is a good example of class distinction. There are "imperial families" that are more noble than "prominent families," but sometimes there is also the sigh of "I wish to never be born into an imperial family in any lifetime." When slaves rebel, what was once pleasant will mostly become tragic. Using new strength to resist corruption and using civilization to eliminate barbarism are examples with precedents in Eastern and Western history.</p>
<p>In the future, new bureaucratic, warlord, and wealthy merchant "prominent families" will always rise up. Perhaps the attitudes of those descendants will be somewhat different!</p>
<h3>On "Lying"</h3>
<p>— Yun Gang</p>
<p>Some time ago, I saw Mr. Yu Dafu mention Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" in "Free Talk." That book attacks realism, cherishes the illusory world of beauty in the past, and also says that Americans will not have literary creations, just because the legend of Washington chopping down the cherry tree is a kind of poison that suffocates the creative instincts of Americans.</p>
<p>Although Wilde is called an aesthetic writer and has this kind of view, I actually think that the highest realm of literature is indeed "lying." The fact that photographic art is not as superb as sketching is a fact that has been unanimously recognized since ancient times. Although God's skills are so wonderful, there are still many dull products, so some people say that the artist's skills and creativity sometimes surpass God's. I don't say that, but I think the artist supplements God's lack of skills in creation. Cao Xueqin wrote "Dream of the Red Chamber" and said it was "a tale of nonsense, full of bitter tears." Cao himself admits to lying, but by lying, he shed his sad accumulation. This is the success of lying from the subjective aspect. And because of this lying, "Dream of the Red Chamber" has gained a vast readership. Needless to say, the greatness of the success of lying from the objective aspect is also unquestionable. Even just its "initial opening of chaos" section of stones and grass is beautiful enough! But no one believes that it is not a lie.</p>
<p>The Book of Genesis in the Western Bible is really absurd, but it has become a very powerful part of literature. People do not believe that God's creation of the world was so casual, but don't Adam and Eve often appear in literary works? China also has equally beautiful legends. Not only could Nuwa refine stones to mend the sky, but she could also knead clay to create humans. Unfortunately, Chinese writers, except for a few such as Qu Yuan who were not very "serious," were not very happy to lie. This is also the reason why the field of Chinese literary history is not very glorious.</p>
<p>However, in folk legends, China still has many beautiful lies, such as the story of the White Snake Lady, the transformation of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai into birds, and Meng Jiangnu who cried down the Great Wall, which can also greatly fill the narrowness of Chinese literary works. In Beiping—that is, ancient Beijing—there are incense mounds and parrot mounds buried in the wild grass near Taoran Pavilion. There are several legends. People who visit and mourn are always lingering there constantly. The not-very-interesting Taoran Pavilion has such one or two mounds, which have added a lot of interest. Someone has to verify that this incense mound is not the tomb of Concubine Xiang, nor is it the place where Lin Daiyu buried flowers; but what is it? It is really what the gentlemen of the "Analects Society" said: "Sugar cake meets a serious person"—who doesn't know that Lin Daiyu is basically a character in "a tale of nonsense"?</p>
<p>Japanese writer Tokutomi Roka, who is now deceased, wrote an excellent book, "Hototogisu," which vividly describes the life of the prodigal son and the places he has been to. Therefore, well-wishers built a temple next to a large tree on the beach of the Sea of ​​Beans. Many writers and young men and women lingered there, leaving behind poems, and there were also paintings like photos. I also visited it, and it seemed very much like it all happened. In fact, it is Roka's lie, at least, most of it is a lie.</p>
<h3>The Return Journey</h3>
<p>— Dong Meikan</p>
<p>A clear, bright and round moon hung in the dim mid-sky; it was the fifteenth night of the tenth month of the old calendar. The cold wind, like needles, eroded the skin of the travelers on the road, and the streetlights were so tired they were about to doze off. "Let's board the ship!" Yes, I was about to temporarily bid farewell to Shanghai, where I had lived for so long.</p>
<p>Farewell. Just thinking of it brought a touch of sadness. Moreover, moreover, I personally tasted the feeling of having no choice but to be sad? Even though it was only a temporary and short separation.</p>
<p>Quietly I strode onto the ship that pulled people apart. How unsettling were the sounds of the rattling wheels! How could I bear it? My fragile heart was uneasy, involuntarily becoming uneasy!</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, the round moon climbed to the zenith. Solitary loneliness and the sorrow of parting flooded my heart. I just leaned silently against the ship's railing, staring at the deep black, trembling sea; the moonlight spilling over the sea's surface was so faint that it almost made one feel empty! My heart trembled along with the trembling sea waves.</p>
<p>"I might as well leave Shanghai as soon as possible," I thought. However, the ship still lazily lay beside the floating bridge, even though it was groaning. Finally, I became impatient and inquired with the steward about the departure time. How annoying! It was said that there were still three full hours to wait.</p>
<p>People's mood, the mood of parting, is always so strange, feeling both empty and suffocated! The pace of time seemed especially slow at this moment. It was not yet time for the ship to depart. The few passengers in the same cabin, who seemed familiar but had not yet exchanged a word, were all asleep, and sleeping soundly. Their snores arrogantly ridiculed me, tossing and turning without sleep. I couldn't help but feel a sense of jealousy, jealous that they all enjoyed the comfort of sound sleep!</p>
<p>Naturally, I also wanted to find a way to pass this depressing time, but what could I do? Finally, I had to force myself to pick up Dowden's book on Shakespeare and reread it from the beginning. As I read, perhaps because I had recently developed a special interest in Shakespeare, and because it was the second time I had read this book, I was easily drawn into it.</p>
<p>As I looked through it page by page, admiring Shakespeare's greatness, I temporarily forgot that the night was late, forgot the fatigue caused by lack of sleep, and forgot that the ship had already turned and had been sailing for half an hour.</p>
<p>The moonlight seemed fainter than before; it had already passed the zenith. The rattling of the wheels sounded rhythmic; the sea breeze shook the window lattices, and the thin cotton quilt could not withstand the attack of the cold. Although it could not be said that "the cold quilt was like iron," the warmth could be said to have dissipated completely.</p>
<p>I fantasized about meeting my hometown and family, and missed Shanghai and the people in Shanghai that I had just left! In an instant, Shakespeare's shadow became blurred again, leaving only the sentences of the Bard, unconsciously hummed in my mouth, yearning for the scent and shadow of his lover:</p>
<p>"I do not wonder at the whiteness of the lily;</p>
<p>Unless it mar the rose's red!"</p>
<h3>The Lying Husband (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>In this way, the young husband spent nearly a month in the library. He calculated that the usual payday was approaching, so he ran to several acquaintances to borrow money with a distressed face. Fortunately, he managed to borrow the money, but he was still uneasy. He solemnly instructed each friend, saying that the loan was a secret, and that he would personally repay them as soon as he had the money. He asked them not to go to his home to demand payment under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Presenting the borrowed money to his beloved wife as salary, letting her manage the living expenses, the young husband felt a bitterness in his heart that was even more bitter than coptis. But in order to make his wife happy, he had to force a happy expression, continuing to play the gramophone and chat and laugh with her, even though he was in pain.</p>
<p>However, the power of money is ultimately greater than anything else. Several friends who had lent him money saw that he never came to repay them. Even though they had received his solemn instructions, they had no choice but to go to his home to demand payment for their own needs.</p>
<p>One day, the young husband had just spent the day in the library and returned home. As he reached his door, he suddenly heard the sound of arguing inside the house. He quickly recognized one of the voices as his wife's, and the other as the friend who had lent him money.</p>
<p>"How could this happen? He gets a salary every month, why would he need to borrow money from you?"</p>
<p>"He clearly borrowed it from me. You can ask him if you don't believe me. You can't try to deny the debt! Hmph!"</p>
<p>The young husband instinctively shrank back, tiptoed away from the door, and wandered aimlessly on the street. He didn't return home until it was dark and the electric lights in the stores were shining, estimating that the friend who had come to demand payment must have left. He dragged his tired body home.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the door, he saw his wife's angry red face, as he had expected. She angrily asked him:</p>
<p>"Did you borrow money from someone?"</p>
<p>The question was like a needle, piercing the young husband's heart, causing him intense pain. He almost couldn't help but cry, but he said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Darling, yes, I did. But these are just small loans, and I can repay him immediately." (The End)</p>
<h3>I Curse That Smile of Yours</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>Even now, when I think of that smile, I still want to say fiercely, I curse you!</p>
<p>The incident happened several years ago, but the impression is too deep, always making it difficult to forget, even though I am extremely willing to bury such an unpleasant thing in my heart.</p>
<p>At that time, I was working as a mediocre clerk in an inn in the Savage Mountain, living a life of half-day of hard labor and half-day of teaching.</p>
<p>Every day, when the sun went down, many mule teams carrying goods would come down from the mountain peaks, laden with yellow dust, and spend the night at the shops in the valley. In addition, every few days, there were also Baiyi women from Qianya Dam (called "Yifang Dam" by the Yunnanese), especially many farming girls, carrying local products such as chickens, ducks, geese, eggs, fruits, and some unknown things produced only in the Yi area, passing through here and coming to the mountain shops to rest for a night before going to Bhamo, a large commercial port in northern Myanmar, to exchange them for things like foreign thread, foreign cloth, foreign needles, foreign oil, and foreign matches. They would then pass through here again, stay over, and wait for the morning light of the next day before leaving again with the morning glow.</p>
<p>They walked in groups of twenty or thirty through the Savage Mountain, which had few inhabitants for three or four days, all of it primeval forest. Of course, there were some men mixed in, but the number of men was always small compared to the women. Each person carried two bamboo baskets full of various goods on their shoulders. The way they carried things looked completely different from how the Han Chinese carried things: the bamboo baskets were tied with four ropes, and the ropes were tied to both ends of a carrying pole. They, however, did not need any ropes. They just inserted both ends of the carrying pole into the bamboo baskets and carried them away. In this way, the teams carrying burdens walked slowly in the mountains during the day, talking and laughing, singing songs all the way, with their youthfulness conquering fatigue and hardship.</p>
<p>At noon, they would place their heavy burdens under the trees on the hillside, take out the tin pots from the bamboo baskets, fill them with vegetables and rice, and go to the nearby stream to wash them clean before returning to place them on a stove supported by three stones. At the same time, another female companion would have already gathered an armful of dry branches and fallen leaves from the forest beside the road and come smiling to light the fire.</p>
<p>After the meal, they would re-embark on the familiar journey. Together with the vast twilight, they would enter the thatched shops in the mountain village, and the day's toil would be shed along with the burdens on their shoulders. When they entered the shop, they were as if returning to their own home, without informing the owner or making any polite greetings. Only laughter and voices, along with shadows, would flood in together, rushing to occupy the best rooms and the best sleeping places. Then, they would rush to the kitchen, grabbing the water ladles and competing for the cool water, each tilting back their necks and drinking, laughing.</p>
<p>Our valley was quiet and extremely cold all day long. Especially after noon, everyone would lie down to rest for a while, and there were few people walking outside the shop, making it even more lonely, as if even the surrounding mountains had sunk into the dreams of ancient times. But when they came down from the mountains, the thatched shops in the valley were replaced inside and out by a kind of lively and joyous atmosphere.</p>
<p>After drinking water and resting, these wandering Yi women would each take a clean white towel and go to the stream to bathe. Not until the night had buried the entire valley, with every thatched hut emitting flickering lights, would they return with the cool night air, singing softly and twisting their wet hair. Instantly, the courtyard of the shop was dotted with piles of cooking fires, while melancholy and joyful songs filled the air. The firelight flashed on their slightly red, glowing faces, and the evening breeze blew through their long hair dripping with water droplets. They really seemed like a group of witches suddenly appearing at night, or perhaps water spirits from the river, or forest goblins, come to visit.</p>
<p>There seems to be no need to exaggerate the appearance of these Yi girls, but I want to say a little: having traveled to many places and seen many ethnic groups, it is rare to find anyone as beautiful as the Baiyi women. What surprised me most was that their homes were in the Nujiang River basin and the Binglang River basin (also known as the Olive River and the Taiping River), all places with poisonous miasma where Han people dared not live for long. How could such beautiful flowers grow there? I heard similar remarks in Kunming, and also on the journey to Guangxi:</p>

<p>Gold Market in a Common State</p>
<p>Guangbang's Sales of Bars Decline by $3.80</p>
<p>The gold market trended downward yesterday, with the price outside the market briefly breaking the $700 mark. However, due to the rise in exchange rates, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listing of sterling was bound to be squeezed. Large investors still had an appetite for buying, so the market situation was relatively stable. The price briefly rebounded midway, but ultimately proved unsustainable due to Guangbang's vigorous selling. The market opened in the morning with news from overseas that the Bank of England had slightly contracted, but the market was bullish on the prospect of a rise, with U.S. banks, forward silver prices, and exchange rates all rising in unison. London spot gold contracted by 9 pence, U.S. cotton rose by 19 points, U.S. wheat rose by 1.25, and stocks fell by half a dollar. The wool market opened at $98.90, then rebounded to $102.30 due to some buyers taking advantage of the low price. After opening, it rose due to the anticipation that the sterling listing would contract by 1.25, but it still declined due to frequent bank sales and Guangbang's forceful selling. The market appeared dull midway. As the domestic market remained loose, Guangbang continued to sell aggressively, and the market closed weaker in the afternoon. There were no special telegrams from Reuters during the morning. People's sentiment was calm. The half-day fluctuation was $4.60, resulting in a decline of $3.80.

<p>The marked price was $716 due to Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank listing of sterling contracting by 1.25, calculated using the exchange rate to convert gold price; the closing price reflected about $15 discounted. Nine more than the previous closing price has pressed. The book value for this month is $715, and for March, $701. In the morning, the supplementary water was $715.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Great Efforts by Bulls and Bears</p>
<p>Extremely Few New Trades in Public Bonds</p>
<p>-Market prices rise and fall unevenly-</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market still trended into chaos. Apart from the exchange period that had some entry and exit, the rest of the new trade was extremely sparse. Both the bullish and bearish sides were tenaciously clinging on, and the majority were prepared to remain waiting for the red plate of the Chinese New Year in order to observe the outcome. In the market, there was exchange, but those were mostly scattered small accounts. To comment on the trend, it is feared that during the Chinese New Year there won't be much fluctuation. There are only two days left for trade. The people in the market mostly expect a good outlook on the red plate. There is also an expectation that the salt tax might discover a new high price above $53. Although this is nonsense and a delusion, if the situation is stable, perhaps there is hope, and not a complete delirium. This prediction is based on the stability of the environment, as well as the continued sale by the bearish side, so it is not without reason. Yesterday passed exceptionally steadily. The trend harmonized on a loop due to chaos. The two morning plates rose before falling, with the number only being one or two points. After the afternoon opening, the rise was insignificantly one point to three points, and because the salt tax rose, it turned into an insignificant rise again. The closing shape was mostly ordinary in the near term and slightly firmer in the distant term. After the salt tax, it seemed slightly tired. The result of market prices was that gains and losses were seen, with the majority being one or two points. The largest fall was in long gold, falling by four points. The total number of transactions totaled $8,671,000, including $1,000 in spot goods. The total futures was $2,245,000 for salt tax, $1,470,000 for military reduction, $770,000 for 19 customs revenue, $1,145,000 for 20 and 20 customs revenue, $1,245,000 for Gold short plus six, while the rest were anywhere from tens of thousands to over fifty thousand.</p>
<h3>New York Utility Stocks Rise in Unison</h3>
<p>New Feng foreign trading report on the 6th, New York stock market, was still calm at first. Although the bulls had some profit-taking, the market shape was still firm. Subsequently because the commercial news was good, including the increase of user of the New York Telephone company, American telephone and telegraph were forceful because of this. Trading was brisk in the hour before the close. Southern American electric especially looked lively. Large transactions from 1,000 shares to 90,000 shares were seen often, Utility stocks have risen in unison in the end. Silver mine and metal stocks all rose as speculators predicted there would be easy silver legislation. Bond fluctuations were slightly higher. Bonds in the retail and entertainment industries flew upwards extremely severely. Full-day total was 4.33 million shares. “Wheat” news was profitable for the majority. The Southwest is still dry. It can be bought when it falls. “Cotton” has had lesser supplies of spot, and is a majority benefit. There are also rumors that farmers have good feedback on both cotton field reduction plans. But the price of cotton must not fly upwards so quickly. Shape is still good. Today’s Dow Jones Indexes have been listed.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Major Factories Aggressively Entering the Market</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Rises by Four Dollars and Seven Cents</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which had been sluggish for a long time, suddenly surged by four dollars today. This kind of price increase has not been seen for a long time. Although there was a control association to maintain it last year, the result was not stable. According to rumors in the market, Shenxin Factory, in view of the daily increase in cotton prices and the lack of increase in yarn prices, is facing difficulties. It is said that the factory has purchased several thousand bales in the standard market. At the same time, there are also rumors of offering to buy back "Picking Flower" and "Dragon Boat" yarns from warehouses. This has stirred up people's hearts, and general speculators have followed suit, resulting in a sharp rise in prices.</p>
<p>(Renbiao Steadily Rises) At the opening of the Renbiao market, due to the rise in American cotton, the market was strong, and short sellers covered their positions. Prices for each month rose by one yuan to one yuan and five cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that a certain factory in the front market was buying, with rumors of support. At the same time, buying interest was strong, and prices for each month soared by two yuan and eight cents to three yuan and six cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 39,000 bales. The sales were: Jifeng 1,850 bales, Tongfu 2,250 bales, Yuanda 1,900 bales, Zhenda 1,500 bales, Shenji 1,250 bales, Yichang 2,150 bales, Yongchang 1,850 bales.

<p>Nanjing 5, Inland 230, Wuhu 10, Fujian 10</p>
<p>Guangdong 25, Shantou 230, Ningbo 8, Sichuan 50</p>
<h3>Cotton Flower Soars Dramatically</h3>
<p>The cotton market is rising more and more fiercely. Due to the rise in American cotton and the lack of exchange rate movement, the calculated cost price is increasing daily, triggering the activities of speculators. At the same time, cotton yarn is also rising, and people's hearts are becoming more and more high-spirited. In addition, the acreage reduction movement for American cotton is still fierce. The future of American cotton will inevitably continue to be viewed favorably, so the buying interest is extremely high. However, Yuanda continues to sell. In terms of the overall situation, it is temporarily difficult to decline.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Rises by 89 Cents) At the opening of the Zheng Biao market, due to the rise in American cotton and the steady gold market, the buying sentiment was still strong. Prices for each month rose by 3.4 cents. In the afternoon, due to the rise in the yarn market, short sellers covered their positions, and the upward trend became more intense. Prices for each month rose by another 3.4 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 136,300 piculs.

<p>March 4350　Rise 65　165,400　Total　　　600,000</p>
<p>April 4380　Rise 85　163,100</p>
<p>(Raw Cotton Merchants Have Strong Attitudes) The demand for spot cotton is still sluggish, but due to the rise in cotton futures, holders of goods have strong attitudes, so fewer and fewer transactions are made. The sources are estimated to be: Yao cotton 350 bales, Lingbao cotton 48.50, Gongda Factory imported 83 pieces, sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Indian Cotton Imported</h3>
<p>Totaling 7,500 Bales</p>
<p>In recent years, the sales of Indian cotton in China have declined, and imports have gradually decreased. British ships coming to Shanghai from Bombay used to carry cotton as their main cargo, with each shipment being at least 500 to 600 tons, and sometimes as much as 1,000 to 2,000 tons. Now, this has plummeted, reducing the volume to 100 to 200 tons. Due to the poor economic situation in China, according to the local British company yesterday, the company's "Meijie Puer" arrived in port at 3 PM, carrying 7,500 bales of Indian cotton, weighing more than 1,500 tons. This is said to be the largest import of Indian cotton in recent months.</p>
<h3>Spot Demand for American Cotton Improves</h3>
<p>- Rises by About 20 Points in National Currency -</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to selling by speculators, but later rose due to good spot demand and good cloth trading. As a result, spot prices rose by - points, and futures prices rose by 16 to 22 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 4 points, and futures prices fell by 23 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to profit-taking by bulls, and the market closed quietly. As a result, Pingar fell by 1 rupee and 2.5 annas, Omra fell by 3 rupees and 2.5 annas, and White Rose fell by 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>American Cotton　　Compared to Previous Day　　Equivalent in National Currency　　English Cotton　Compared to Previous Day　Equivalent in National Currency</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The Flour Market Has Equally Strong Bullish and Bearish Forces</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the market atmosphere for each month presented an initial appearance of calmness and stability. Although the quotation for foreign wheat fluctuated little, Chicago was better by 48 points, and Canadian wheat was better by about 4 points. However, after the opening, because there was not much activity from factories, outside interests slightly increased their purchases, and people's hearts became firmer. When the market opened in the afternoon, each month was generally hovering. Factories slightly opened up in the current month, while forward months were slightly pulled up. However, since the settlement was approaching, both inside and outside the industry were engaged in closing positions. Although it was heard that the government would import wheat again, about 3,000 to 4,000 tons, and was negotiating with manufacturers, the market's sentiment ultimately saw the bullish and bearish forces as equally matched, and did not see a fall. As a result, the current month was unchanged, March was better by 5%, April was better by 7.5%, May was better by 1%, and June was better by 1.5%, and July was better by 1.75%.</p>
<h3>Yin Bian Yuan Alone Falls Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of supply from various groups were still scarce, totaling nearly 20 dealers, (over 3,000 bags, of which late rice accounted for the majority). The contract sales of out-of-town dealers were also smooth, at over 2,000 bags. As the end of the year is approaching, the market situation is generally flat, and there is already a closing sentiment. Therefore, the prices of Qingjiao, Songsih, and Late Rice remained unchanged. The situation in the local shops was also similar. As a result, Changbang, Su Tong, Nangang, and other Japonica rice, as well as Du - Yangjian, were all fixed. Only Yin Bian Yuan, although it is an important seasonal commodity, ultimately suffered a decline of about a chi due to excessive arrivals and an imbalance between supply and demand, resulting in a dim market color.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 13-14 arriving boats from various groups. The market for each commodity became sluggish, and contract sales were unchanged due to the closing of positions. High-quality Japonica rice was stable, while medium and low grades increased slightly. Bai Yuan, Yang Du, and Bu Jian's prices were firm by several cents. Yin Yuan, Early Bo Rice, and Ke Jian were set.</p>
<h3>Soybean Factories Suddenly Intensify Purchases</h3>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grains Market has completely closed, but soybeans are still being traded. Yesterday, factories exclusively purchased 12 truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans, with prices opening at 3.45 yuan. There were also export dealers buying 500 bags of Guide soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.55 to 3.53 yuan. The market price was about 2-3% higher than the formal market. The inventory of miscellaneous grains reported yesterday still had omissions, which are recorded below: Tianjin Yellow Soybeans 4,000 bags, Tianjin Green Soybeans 1,500 bags, Chongming Sand Yellow 2,000 bags, Hankou Green Soybeans 2,000 bags, Hankou Sesame 500 bags, and various types of wheat 10,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Caishutang Oil Inventory Statistics</h3>
<p>The Caishutang Oil Market continued to have 170 transactions yesterday, and the market situation remained unchanged. The inventories of each oil are recorded below: Ship Niuzhuang Soybean Oil 1,500 pieces, Wheel Niuzhuang Soybean Oil 1,500 pieces, Wheel Lianqi Soybean Oil 5,000 pieces, Ship Lianqi Soybean Oil 600 pieces, Wheel Shaqi Oil 400 pieces, Wheel Lianqi Soybean Oil 1,000 pieces, Ship Xiaoqi Oil 100 pieces, Warehouse Raw Oil 2,000 pieces, Light Skin Raw Oil 1,500 pieces, Boer Raw Oil 500 pieces, Jiaozhou Raw Oil 100 pieces, Niuzhuang Seed Oil 40 pieces, Jiaozhou Seed Oil 500 pieces, Various Port Tinned Raw Oil 20,000 cans, Warehouse Large Basket Oil 1,000 pieces, Warehouse Small Basket Oil 500 pieces, and Ship Niuzhuang Yellow Soybeans 2,000 dan, Ship Shahe Yellow Soybeans 800 dan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Huangbai Factory Jing Silk Sales Turn Smooth</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Silk Exports Decrease by 30% Last winter, silk industry representatives from various countries held an international silk industry conference in Paris, resolving to restrict the dumping of Japanese silk. It is now learned that the silk weaving industries in countries such as Britain, France, the United States, and India have successively implemented the resolution. Therefore, Japanese silk exports have decreased by 30%. Last month (i.e., January), the total exports of Japanese silk from Yokohama, Kobe, and other export ports were only 80,548 bales.</p>
<p>▲Wuxi Silk Waste Continuously Shipped to Shanghai Recently, silk manufacturers in Wuxi, in view of the launch of overseas silk sales, have been shipping their inventories to Shanghai in batches. In the past few days, silk factories such as Changtu and Tangjian have loaded 340 dan, awaiting sale in warehouses.</p>
<p>▲Factory Jing Silk Sales Turn Smooth Inland silk factories have begun to resume work due to the launch of spring silk sales, and the demand for raw silk has surged. In view of the fact that the prices of Huangbai Factory Jing silk in Shanghai have fallen to the lowest level, they have successively started purchasing, and the transaction volume is not weak. It is estimated that silk merchants in Hangzhou and Shanghai have purchased 80 bales of Huangbai Factory Jing silk, and the price has risen by 30-40 yuan. However, European and American firms are still in the process of negotiating prices, and transactions are pending.</p>
<h3>English Keemun Black Tea Sells Well</h3>
<p>According to information received by British merchant firms in Shanghai, the London tea market has made significant progress recently. High-grade Keemun black tea from our country, with excellent tea leaves and fragrant aroma, saw exceptionally rapid sales and gradually increasing prices during the turn of December and January. Merchants have made considerable profits. At present, the high-grade inventory has almost been completely sold out. However, low-grade inferior goods, especially low-grade black tea from Hubei and Hunan, have been severely squeezed due to the strong production of Ceylon and Indian tea last year. This kind of market situation of raising the high and suppressing the low is the opposite of what happened at the same time last year.</p>
<h3>Metal Company Iron Price Increase Resumes</h3>
<p>The metal market has already shown signs of closing, and customers are also busy closing their accounts. The market situation feels quite deserted, so it is very difficult to develop each commodity. However, the Company Iron market, which had been sluggish in the past two weeks, suddenly changed its old appearance in the past two days. Not only was the sales smooth, but the selling price has also soared. It is found that the spot goods are already limited, and the source of supply is also insufficient. People's hearts are extremely firm. Manufacturers such as Huacheng, China, and Tianan have all made purchases, and out-of-town dealers such as Daxincheng are also working hard to collect goods. Therefore, more than 1,400 boxes have been ordered in two days. The price was initially 26.5 yuan, and gradually increased to 28 yuan. The Zhenzhen Laogang factory's goods have even risen to 30 yuan. It is heard that the overseas price is 7.5-7.6 US dollars per box, which is also 2-3% better than before. Therefore, the local standard is expected to rise without falling.</p>

<p>Random Remarks</p>
<h3>On the Lunar New Year and the Lunar Calendar</h3>
<p>— Wenli</p>
<p>Since the government authorities issued an order to absolutely abolish the lunar calendar and use the solar calendar, people still enthusiastically celebrate the lunar New Year every year. What is the reason for this? The government authorities have gone into considerable detail in implementing the abolition of the lunar calendar and the use of the solar calendar, such as prohibiting government agencies from taking holidays, prohibiting the sale of lunar calendars, and prohibiting the combined use of the old and new calendars on calendars and newspapers. The merchants' seasonal accounts have been changed to four seasons a year, and other methods have been implemented. However, people still follow the old customs and etiquette on festivals and New Years, and regard official orders as mere formalities. Now, let's first discuss what is worth cherishing about the lunar calendar for the people. The twelve months of the lunar year predict the four seasons of climate, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, very accurately. January, February, and March are spring, April, May, and June are summer, July, August, and September are autumn, and October, November, and December are winter. Generally, the climate is more or less mild, hot, cool, and cold, without much deviation. This is the first point. The lunar calendar is very accurate for the phases of the moon, especially the full moon on the fifteenth, and the tides are also very accurate. This is very convenient for people who forget what day it is today. They can immediately know the phase of the moon, whether it is waxing or waning. This is the second point. These two major characteristics of the lunar calendar make it much more convenient for farmers and fishermen to cultivate and go to sea. In addition, the lunar calendar has no advantages in society. Because the solar calendar has become the world's common calendar, now that the sea ban has been lifted and there is frequent communication between China and foreign countries, the solar calendar is more convenient and suitable than the lunar calendar. However, whether it is farmers and fishermen in the countryside or small citizens in the city, they are all "disobeying orders" and using the lunar calendar. In addition to the actual use of the lunar calendar for farmers and fishermen in farming and fishing, small citizens in the city benefit economically from the lunar calendar. The lunar calendar has a leap month every three years, or two leap months every five years. A short month has twenty-nine days, and a long month has only thirty days (solar calendar months have thirty days, and long months have thirty-one days, and only February has twenty-eight days, but this does not happen often, but this year it is twenty-eight days). Merchants settle accounts monthly. In three years, they will have one more month of income. Moreover, the days are shorter, and it is easier to reach the end of the month. Especially for the wage income of shop assistants, how great is the benefit? This is the biggest reason why small citizens in the city insist on preserving and practicing the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>However, many second landlords in Shanghai are also forcing tenants to calculate rent based on the lunar calendar, which is an extra levy by the second landlord on the third tenant. Most third tenants are hardworking families whose lives are not well-off. This extra levy by the second landlord is a considerable loss. For example, a person whose monthly salary is calculated according to the solar calendar pays rent calculated according to the lunar calendar, so he pays one more month's rent every three years. Now that the second landlord is carrying out a rent reduction campaign, the third tenant should also object to this extra levy. The most unreasonable thing is that the apartments in the French Concession are also calculating rent based on the lunar calendar. The author has been subjected to this kind of near-extortion exploitation by second landlords and apartment owners. Now, I am willing to protest to them here on behalf of the exploited. I hope that the second landlords (apartment owners are also a kind of second landlord) will consider that the rent money of poor families also comes from blood and sweat (the money of us writers who sell articles for a living comes from racking our brains). You are carrying out a rent reduction campaign to reduce the burden of life, and the burden of life of the third tenant should also be reduced.</p>
<p>Getting back to the main point, since the lunar calendar is beneficial to the lives of farmers and small citizens, even though the lunar calendar has been abolished, the common people still clearly recognize the scene of "getting rid of the old with the sound of firecrackers" and are unwilling to make mistakes. Political facilities were originally based on the lives of the people. Since the lives of the people require the lunar calendar, even if you issue "repeated orders and injunctions," the habit of "obeying in appearance but disobeying in reality" will not change. If this is a special defect of the people's superstition in practicing the lunar calendar, then there is an error in not understanding social phenomena.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Ideal Woman</h3>
<p>— Naishuo</p>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote an article on the ideal woman in this publication. Peng read it and criticized me: "You really know so many tricks! But you haven't said enough!" Once, he said: "You've been talking about women for so long, and you still say you're an amateur. I'm going to give you a hard time!" Yesterday, I ran into Miss Yi (who is a disciple of Mr. Liu Bannong, and this is the first time I've called a lady "Miss"). With her gentle demeanor, she launched a campaign to question my nonsense article, saying that it was not only theoretically wrong, but also too insulting to them. Originally, to be honest, that article was indeed nonsense. I couldn't sleep in the middle of the night, or I needed to prepare for the next few days' expenses, so my fingers were a little itchy, and I just made up a bunch of nonsense. It's quite difficult to truly express any great principles in this world. Let's just make up some nonsense. This will only earn me a "degenerate brat" from the so-called revolutionaries, which I don't care about at all.</p>
<p>Getting back to the topic</p>
<p>Miss Yi's first criticism of my mistake was that I paid too much attention to the beauty of women. She said that she was not against beautiful women, but that she could not put the focus on beauty. If you idealize in this wrong way, you will easily get the sorrow of being unable to achieve your goals because reality does not allow it. Because beauty has a standard, you say she is beautiful, but there will be someone more beautiful; and there will be someone even more beautiful above that. And usually beautiful women cannot be completely beautiful. If you want to pursue a completely beautiful woman, then you have to look for her in the realm of fantasy. Only paying attention to the requirements of beauty is a fundamental mistake in the ideal woman. Realistically speaking, beautiful women are very difficult to find. Moreover, a beautiful woman is very difficult to share hardships with. She will often demand a high level of material enjoyment because of her innate beauty. It is always difficult for a modern young man to satisfy her in this regard. Even if he struggles to satisfy her, it is not worth it. Because a woman without sacrifice is a woman without love. And it is extremely unwise to dedicate one's life to a woman without love. Even if a beautiful woman has a good nature, she may not be able to endure hardship together, let alone love you sincerely. Moreover, women with good natures are very few and far between.</p>
<p>The second point is that she also opposed my requirement for gentleness of character, saying that it was tantamount to treating women as attachments, which was a big mistake. Now we must recognize that men simply have no right to make women become parasites or attachments to men. In history and in advanced modern countries, women have shown that they have the same powers and abilities as men. They can control production matters and can undertake other important political and cultural work. Although women in our country are relatively backward, men of the current generation can only help them to gradually share the various affairs of this human society and quickly move towards an equal position in the economy and society. We must never again foster their dependence and turn them into appendages of the family, into canaries that only sing songs.</p>
<p>The third point is that she said that my ideological requirements for women are also fundamentally wrong. She said that I completely wanted to deny the individual existence of women, and only wanted to turn them into a personal plaything. How ashamed should a modern young man be to have this kind of thinking? What right do I have to rely on to treat women like that?</p>
<p>She said that we must never have the mentality of making women appendages or playthings. And we cannot build the ideal woman solely on the point of beauty. In any case, this is a huge mistake. A person's requirements for a woman should focus less on her beautiful appearance, and should pay more attention to her thoughts and character. Regarding the aspect of beauty, we should only require her to have a well-developed, well-proportioned, and healthy female body, and should not require her to have a flower-like appearance. Regarding the aspect of thought and character, we must require her to: first, she should have a firm understanding of society and her personal life; second, she must at least be able to have the skills to live; third, she must have the determination to share a difficult life with you; fourth, she must have her own personality. Not paying attention to her understanding is equivalent to not paying attention to the goal of men and women living together; not paying attention to her living skills is equivalent to not paying attention to the consolidation of the foundation of men and women's lives; not paying attention to her determination to struggle for life is equivalent to not paying attention to the persistence of her love for you; not paying attention to her personality is equivalent to not</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>paying attention to her spiritual help to you. If a person does not pay attention to his ideal woman in this way, it is conceivable that he is ambiguous about other things. Because a contemporary young man, at least, cannot have any comforting hope for life. At least, his life is full of difficulties and struggles.</p>
<p>Finally, she said, "That's why after reading your article, I felt obligated to tell you this. Your desires are completely improper, and are simply like competing with a shadow."</p>
<p>Miss Yi said so much. Although the reasoning is correct, it is actually nonsense like mine. This is truly an "ideal", a "genuine ideal". I really dare not accept it. So, after my face turned slightly red, I only replied with this sentence:</p>
<p>"Miss! Your own ideal is indeed higher than mine!"</p>
<p>In my heart, I was smiling: It turns out that the face and other things of the girl are hundreds of thousands of miles away from my "ideal". Where do I hope for it, to be honest! (End)</p>
<h3>On Drinking Alcohol</h3>
<p>— A-Dun</p>
<p>Yesterday I discussed alcohol once, and today I want to talk about drinking alcohol again. According to Mr. Zhou Zuoren, although foreigners do not understand the way of drinking tea, they know quite a bit about drinking alcohol. In reality, foreigners' drinking only knows one aspect but not the other.</p>
<p>In essence, there are two ways to drink alcohol, one refined and one crude, one southern and one northern. "The spirit is like a whale sucking up hundreds of rivers," "The throat is like a scorching cauldron, and the breath is like thunder" is crude drinking, which is the northern style. "Sipping gently and drinking slowly" is refined drinking, which is the southern style.</p>
<p>Crude drinking, within the northern style, also has two types. One type is ordinary, with the aim of drinking alcohol, and the other is extraordinary, with the aim of swallowing the "momentum" of the alcohol. The ordinary type is practiced by laborers. After twelve hours of hard work, they buy a packet of peanuts, get four ounces of strong liquor, drink casually, and then leave. The extraordinary type must be heroic men from Yan and Zhao, on the outskirts of the Great Wall with white grass and yellow sand, horses neighing sadly, majestic passes standing tall, holding great power in their hands, swallowing alcohol like whales under the moonlight, burning wild grass and roasting newly caught birds, drinking and singing, in a carefree and generous manner.</p>
<p>Refined drinking, within the southern style, also has two types. However, both are ordinary, and the difference lies in whether the purpose is drinking alcohol. In an empty room with no one, only the sound of falling leaves can be heard. One takes a small cup, slowly pours, and carefully drinks. This is to discern the "taste" of the alcohol. Although one may not necessarily drink a lot, the purpose is in the drinking itself. There is also another type where two or three idlers sit in a hotel, with bare arms and legs crossed. The wine cup barely touches their lips before they put it down again. The purpose of this type is not drinking alcohol but killing time. Even if they raise their cups from time to time, they are merely putting on a show.</p>
<p>For the crude northern style, it is appropriate to use beer or Fenjiu, drinking quickly to get drunk quickly. For the refined southern style, it is appropriate to use rice wine or Shaoxing wine, not necessarily to get drunk, or even not to get drunk at all. Foreigners only know how to swallow wildly, which is clearly crude drinking and not refined drinking, clearly the northern style and not the southern style. Therefore, it is said that "they only know one aspect but not the other."</p>
<p>When drinking alcohol, one should have alcohol in one's eyes, alcohol in one's mouth, and alcohol in one's heart. If not, then one is diminishing the seriousness of alcohol, distorting the meaning of alcohol. Chun Yukun could get drunk with one dou or one shi. When he was drinking alcohol, he was looking at beautiful women, with no alcohol in his eyes and only thoughts of beauties in his heart. Therefore, even if there was alcohol in his mouth, it was not considered alcohol to him. Thus, the capacity of one dou could be used to drink one shi. Naturally, drinking alcohol is materialistic. If there is clearly alcohol being drunk, then whether one gets drunk or not is determined. However, for some people, whether they get drunk or not is determined by their perception. In our hometown, there are people who get drunk just by seeing a wine flag. They come out of their house without drinking alcohol, completely sober. When they see a wine flag, they immediately become slurred and staggeringly drunk. They remain completely drunk all the way until they go back home after drinking their fill. However, as soon as they see their house, they become sober again. This is naturally because they think of the taste of alcohol when they see the wine flag, and they cannot help but feel intoxicated. They think of their wife's face when they see the house, and they cannot help but feel sober. However, this is enough to prove that whether some people get drunk or not is determined by their perception.</p>
<p>Of course, in the above-mentioned ways of drinking alcohol, regardless of which style or type, there is one thing in common, which is that drinking alcohol is voluntary, entirely dependent on one's own pleasure, with no unavoidable reasons. However, in this world, there are actually situations where one must drink. When offered by elders, or when one loses in a drinking game and is penalized with alcohol, that is understandable. During the Wei and Jin dynasties, people took "Wang Shi San" (a type of drug) and could not dispel its effects without drinking alcohol. Therefore, they drank alcohol desperately. At that time, drinking alcohol became a trend. One could not become a famous scholar without drinking alcohol. Even now, there are still literati (regardless of the Shanghai or Beijing style) who use drinking alcohol to show their elegance.</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol can make people forget reality. Therefore, prisoners about to be executed were always given some alcohol to drink. However, among the prisoners, there were those who refused to drink alcohol and wanted to watch the executioner's blade come down clearly. This kind of action really makes the weak feel ashamed. Executioners always drink some alcohol to embolden themselves before execution. So, if they encounter such a prisoner, I really don't know what face they would have to take action.</p>
<p>"Using human heads as wine cups," and they are drinking heartily.</p>

<p>I grew up in a place that adheres to the most ancient customs. I studied in private schools from a young age, and after five years of this, I felt that in this era, one must attend school to make progress. So, I entered a higher elementary school. After graduating, I originally intended to continue my studies, but because I wanted to learn some specialized skills and did not want to enter a regular middle school, I continued to study classical texts. After another two or three years of this, I had read all of the Four Books and Five Classics. At that time, some people suggested that I become a teacher, and others suggested that I manage household affairs at home. Because I wanted to learn specialized skills, I did not accept any of these suggestions. Finally, I entered the Provincial Vocational School's dyeing and weaving department, which was very prestigious at the time. After graduating, because the school's machinery was too simple, the school sent me to the provincial First Textile Factory for a six-month internship. Upon completion, because there was no work, the Department of Education introduced me to a famous textile factory in Shanghai. After inspection, I brought my own meals and accommodation and entered the factory for an internship. After about four months, I happened to see that a certain textile factory was recruiting industrial patrol officers, so I took the exam and was fortunately accepted. Thus, I entered the factory for another internship. In this way, I received some allowances each month and interned for another half a year. By the latter half of last year, I no longer had to worry about food and clothing. I thought that my career was settled, and that I only needed to move forward and there would be a way. Who knew that in the 23rd year, my career disappeared, and I became "unemployed." Alas! For the sake of the word "career," I spent five whole years of my precious time and a lot of my family's hard-earned money. Who knew that today, I can't even find a place to go for an internship, and I am drifting in the severe cold and storms thousands of miles away, hungry. Alas! Career, you really harm people!</p>
<p>Editor, in my current situation, how do you suggest I struggle?</p>
<p>Isn't the Ministry of Education now advocating the promotion of vocational schools? Aren't the private middle schools in various provinces going to be converted into vocational schools? May I ask, Editor, where will these batches of vocational students running out of vocational schools go? Wishing you good health! Sincerely, Zhang Shanzhang</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "Career" does not harm people, and "specialized skills" even less so. These not only do not harm people, but they are also things that everyone in society should have. But, Mr. Zhang, what has harmed you? It is this unreasonable society that has harmed you.</p>
<p>This society has reached its end, so "unemployment" is not a strange phenomenon, but rather something that is bound to happen. And for an individual in this society to find a way out for himself, no matter what method he tries to use, the result will probably be useless, except for a few people who have special opportunities. Because the "unemployment" suffering that each individual in the current society experiences is mostly not due to his own shortcomings, but rather driven by the flaws in the social system. Therefore, it is beneficial to both the individual and society for an individual to serve society and survive in society with specialized skills. However, before the root cause of the "society's" illness is removed, specialized talents cannot avoid the danger of decline. Unemployment is not an individual's problem, nor can it be avoided by individual efforts, but rather a problem of the entire society, which needs to be solved by the transformation of the entire society. Therefore, if the entire society has a way out, then individuals will also have a way out. Otherwise, relying solely on individual efforts is like buying lottery tickets, and while there are people who win prizes, they are very few.</p>
<p>For Mr. Zhang's current livelihood, the only way is to seek employment as much as possible. If there is no one to introduce him, then he can register with the China Vocational Education Society and submit a letter to the Self-Employment Introduction column in this newspaper's supplement to seek employment. This is a way of "doing one's best," but I dare not say whether it will be effective.</p>

<h3>The Lonely Man (9)</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>(5) Night Talk</p>
<p>A few days after Kejia and Jingyi got married. The days of spring fly by so quickly, please forgive me for not remembering exactly how many days it was, but in fact, it wouldn't matter much even if I remembered clearly.</p>
<p>Jingwen's mother had already moved into the new house, fulfilling the jest of "Mom and younger sister getting married together." She herself was busy every day, saying that she definitely wouldn't go back to Hangzhou to be an unschooled teacher. Her daily travels were all for the sake of finding someone to continue her position. Xiaoxun was living a contradictory life. He disliked Shanghai, yet he also loved Hangzhou, just like he loved Shanghai. It seemed that when he was happy, it didn't matter where he lived. Kejia wanted him to live in the new house, so he moved in without any objections.</p>
<p>One evening, Jingwen sent her replacement to Hangzhou, and the people here were chatting in the "spring-filled" new room. Kejia and Jingyi were snuggled together, sitting side by side on the sofa. The old lady was leaning against the bed, she was always smiling -- a kind middle-aged woman. Xiaoxun was sitting on the writing desk, one leg supporting the ground, the other leg resting on his knee, swinging it. Everyone was cracking melon seeds, seizing every opportunity to say witty remarks without a purpose.</p>
<p>"Why do most of the melon seed shells that are spat on the ground face upwards?" Xiaoxun asked triumphantly.</p>
<p>Six pairs of eyes simultaneously shot towards the floor.</p>
<p>"It is said to be a sign of courtship, women often hold back in that way, ignoring men."</p>
<p>"Is our little sister like that?" Clearly, this was a good opportunity to say something witty, and Xiaoxun seized it. Jingyi's mouth drooped downwards, and she pushed Kejia with a charming push, as if saying "Look, he's taking advantage of me." However, she refused to admit defeat: "Yes! This can make a man heartbroken."</p>
<p>She bit her lip, her gaze pausing from Kejia's mother's face to Xiaoxun's face, and the three of them laughed at the same time. Xiaoxun also forced a smile, stopped the leg that was swinging on his knee, and stared at the melon seed shells on the ground in a daze. The March spring breeze blew in from the window, stirring his naturally wavy hair.</p>
<p>A clever woman understands everything, a clever man also understands everything; naturally, a clever middle-aged woman understands even more. At this time, the old lady slightly raised her voice and said:</p>
<p>"The two sisters are really the same. Talking without thinking." She turned her head back, "Isn't Mr. Zhu preparing to marry a wife because of Miss Xu?" The old lady deliberately said with a smile, so as not to make her words edged.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Auntie." Xiaoxun shook his naturally wavy hair, "No woman wants to marry me!" He also deliberately said with a smile, seemingly wanting to steer the topic away.</p>
<p>"Humph!" Jingyi blurted out, "Waiting for Qin Hu to get divorced?"</p>
<p>It seemed as if no one had expected it, and they stopped talking, stopped cracking melon seeds. Xiaoxun reached behind him and took out a cigarette from the cigarette can on the writing desk, lit it, and the white smoke drifted out of the window with the spring breeze, lightly. The old lady stood up and yawned.</p>
<p>"I wonder when Jingwen will be back, I want to go to sleep." Saying that, she walked out on her own. The clock struck ten.</p>
<p>"Brother," Kejia moved his body forward, looking very serious, "What is Qin Hu's attitude exactly?"</p>
<p>"What attitude?" He exhaled a puff of smoke, and the leg resting on his knee began to swing.</p>
<p>"Seeing her attitude that day... attitude..." He was not familiar with the appropriate wording for that kind of thing, his body falling back onto the sofa, looking at Jingyi, naturally asking for help.</p>
<p>"You talked a lot that day, right?" Calmly, preventing a nervous reaction.</p>
<p>"Yes. We took a lap around Nanjing Road that day, and divorcing the young master is something to be expected. She left me to marry this capitalist's husband, so she wouldn't still be clinging to someone as insignificant as me. But she said that the young master is not a good person, and expressing intimacy with me is to need me to be a puppet once more. Jingyi's words guessed one aspect of her, do you think I'm that kind of person?"</p>
<p>He laughed nervously, the laughter so unpleasant, like an owl in the middle of the night. He flicked the cigarette bud out the window, his body sliding from the writing desk into the writing chair.</p>

<h3>Dario's Predictions: Hollywood's Trends This Year (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Garbo will leave the film industry forever</p>
<p>Fairbanks will return to Hollywood</p>
<p>Mary Pickford's fate is also covered in clouds. Especially at the end of the year, she will encounter many thorns. She will engage in writing thereafter; within two years, she will complete a very valuable memoir. This year she will produce a film, but this film may not be outstanding.</p>
<p>Constance Bennett will have high luck this year, and she will have amazing developments. There is no possibility of her getting divorced this year. She needs to pay special attention to her health, especially she should avoid undergoing surgery.</p>
<p>German star Leni Riefenstahl will return to Europe this year. The above is our abridged translation of the fate of the top ten actresses this year. Now let's see how things will change on the male stars' side.</p>
<p>John Barrymore's luck is average. His works continue to be successful. His family life is happy, and he will have a son.</p>
<p>What about Lionel Barrymore? He will encounter great danger this year. Clouds cover his luck.</p>
<p>John Gilbert's luck is not bad. Either this year or next year, he will have twins, and they will be daughters. He has no son in his fate.</p>
<p>Clark Gable's health is still not improving. But he will hold a wedding.</p>
<p>Charles Farrell will once again show his talents on the screen this year. His marriage problems will also be resolved satisfactorily. The dangerous period has passed!</p>
<p>Edmund Lowe and Lilyan Tashman are best off not flying this year. Otherwise, the result will be either injury or crippling of one or both legs.</p>
<p>Gary Cooper will still have to live a single life this year. He will be frightened by flying this year.</p>
<p>He will soon make a fortune -- but it will definitely not come from acting, mostly from oil mines.</p>
<p>Fairbanks will suffer some bad luck and will lose his health. He will return to Hollywood from England.</p>
<p>Douglas Fairbanks Jr. will also return to Hollywood. According to the crystal ball, if he gets married this year, the marriage will still not have good results. He had best find a woman outside the film industry.</p>
<p>Adolphe Menjou will get married again this year. This time his wife will be a woman outside the film industry. This time they can live together until old age.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin will produce a valuable film this year. He is about to marry Paulette Goddard. This marriage will definitely remain very happy this year. But if not, there will be many disputes this year.</p>
<p>In addition to the predictions about the lives of movie stars, Daario also gave considerable instructions on the trends of the entire Hollywood film industry. He said that the American film industry has a tendency to recover and prosper this year. Many new companies and many new stars will emerge this year. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "The Chief"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Chief</p>
<p>A character who enjoys great fame on the radio station is actually used by the producer as a drawing point on the screen, which is not excessive in terms of business competition. Just like China's Wang Wu Neng or Jiang Xiaoxiao, going from the stage to the screen, aren't they also receiving great welcome? In addition, "The Mad Musketeer" also featured the great singer Chaliapin, who caused a sensation on the screen for a while. Therefore, Edwin also moved from the radio station to the screen.</p>
<p>In the stories told by Edwin on the radio station, there was this "The Chief", which was quite praised by people. In this story, he humorously satirized the so-called hero.</p>
<p>The so-called Henry is the head of the fire brigade who died in the line of duty. The citizens were grateful for his virtue and added the name of the hero's son to Henry. However, Henry is actually not a hero. On the contrary, he is just a clumsy and honest mediocrity. However, Edwin also made him establish special merit in a chance encounter. These chance encounters are naturally used as material for laughter. He fights with bears, and he makes faces with monkeys. Similarly, there are also many people who use his name as a tool for campaigning, and there are also people who harm his mother because he is their political enemy. As a result, this hero, in order to rescue his mother, calls for votes for the cunning politicians.</p>
<p>In the midst of this, he sharply satirized this hero, and at the same time, he sympathized with the hero's honest heart, and even explained that he would not wear a gentleman's top hat and evening dress. And such a hero is always used by bureaucratic politicians. Isn't that right? You can treat him as any kind of puppet, and he will not feel this ineffable sadness. This so-called hero is both pitiful and laughable. In this way, "The Chief" has its own profound meaning.</p>
<p>But in terms of performance, it is not seen how successful it is. Edwin's performance does not match the brilliance of the story, although his tone of dialogue is very worthy of people's attention.</p>
<p>As for the director's technique, there is nothing special to commend. The most worthy of mention is the transition from a static atmosphere to a climax. When Henry discovered his mother being robbed in the middle of the night, the climax began as he called out "Mom" loudly. Then came Henry's anxious arrival at his company, followed by his mother's peaceful conversion of the bandits, and then Henry's madness, running madly through the streets and shouting. This one climax ends the story. Although this is not popular with Chinese audiences when the program returns to the main topic on the radio station, it is precisely Edwin's purpose.</p>
<p>Even so, this is not an outstanding achievement in American comedy films, but it is still passable.</p>
<h3>The Ladies Man</h3>
<p>— Li Man</p>
<p>Facing the Music is Showing in Shanghai</p>
<p>"The Ladies Man" is another empty and boring musical comedy.</p>
<p>Therefore, we inevitably have to use the old tricks, affected affectation, senseless chases, and absurd jokes... The story only has three sentences. Young Jacques sees the beautiful young lady Vina in the theater, so he tries every means to pursue her, and finally achieves his ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Here, Stan Laurel has stumbled several times, bumped into twenty or so strangers, broke eight or nine bottles, and hid six or seven times under the sofa in a pile of fur... These, these, are what consumed all the film of "The Ladies Man".</p>
<p>However, the director Harry Hughes's handling is commendable here. He has handled the music, songs, and humorous movements harmoniously. In the final scenes, dancing is on stage, and Stan Laurel and the thieves are chasing each other off stage. He handled it in an orderly manner, first a shot of the dancing on stage, then Stan Laurel and others secretly taking their seats, then a shot of the dancing on stage, then Stan Laurel's escape and the thieves' pursuit, then the dancing on stage again, and so on...</p>
<p>And there are also some places that are handled very concisely, such as the orderly pace of the army on the street, to the pace of the actors indoors, and the singing of the actors on stage, etc. in several scenes.</p>
<p>The following places:</p>
<p>(1) Stan Laurel flips through the phone book, looking for fabricated names.</p>
<p>(2) Vina shows Jacques the book "This is to Love", and Jacques gives Vina the book "Hold my Heart".</p>
<p>Compared to the other scenes, these are more vivid and natural. As for the rest, like "The Great Ziegfeld" and other musical comedies, everything is forced, boring, absurd, and unreasonable, even though "Faust"'s "Jewel Song" is used to attract viewers here.</p>
<p>As for the performance, Stan Laurel's ability to make a commotion is worth mentioning, but at most, like Roscoe Arbuckle, Laurel and Hardy, etc., besides temporarily making the idle open their mouths to laugh, he cannot give us some of the deeper meaning that Charlie Chaplin gives us.</p>
<p>Nancy Burn, who plays Vina, performed very well.</p>
<h3>Douglas Fairbanks: One Reason for His Decisive Departure</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The immensely famous Douglas Fairbanks has left his domain of Hollywood, left his beautiful wife Mary Pickford, and gone to London, England. Some are saying he will not return to Hollywood. Perhaps he will even establish a British film company to compete with American films. Consequently, people generally feel that even if Douglas Fairbanks is not guilty of any treasonous behavior, there must be a rift between him and the American film industry that caused him to be dissatisfied and depart decisively.</p>
<p>But what is the reason for this decisive departure? This is very difficult to know. Even if someone knows, they would never dare to make it public in the newspapers, because America is still hoping for his return. Even if this martial arts star has become a figure of the past in the American film industry, the American film industry would never lightly let him defect to the enemy's side. But why is Fairbanks so resentful towards the American people in general?</p>
<p>It is said that he does not have any deep-seated hatred towards the American film industry. However, he is very resentful of the American social circles for having once slighted him. This may be one reason he is seeking glory abroad. American society (Society) is inherently extremely strict. They are a small circle of the highest class, into which not only people without money or status cannot squeeze, but even the nouveau riche can only sigh in despair. After Douglas Fairbanks became famous in the film industry, he very much wanted to squeeze into the social circles of Santa Barbara, California. However, those social figures were unwilling to open their doors and let Hollywood figures in. Therefore, Fairbanks left in a fit of anger. When he and Mary arrived in London, the British King even granted them an audience.</p>
<p>Whether this is the reason for the rift between Fairbanks and the social circles of his own country is unknown. But the occurrence of this event is indeed real.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Queen Christina (7)</h3>
<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>The young special envoy, hearing the innkeeper's words, happily said, "It would be wonderful if I could find a place to stay tonight." The innkeeper then said to Christina, "Sir, your room is the best in our inn... I wonder if it would be possible to ask you to share a room with this gentleman for one night..." Christina's breathing became a little short. Her eyebrows rose. The young special envoy saw this and said to her, "Sir, I should not force you, but..." He smiled, and Christina's heart could not help but skip a beat. The young special envoy looked at her very earnestly and said, "I feel there is much more to talk about..." Christina said, "It would be very interesting to talk to you..." Her eyes darted around and she did not continue. The innkeeper felt that she had yielded a little, so he intervened from the side. The young special envoy added, "I can talk to you all night. I can also say nothing at all. Whatever you command... What I ask for is not just a bed—I also want to talk to you about home!"</p>
<p>Christina looked at him, feeling very embarrassed. Finally, she said softly, "I would rather give up the room and warm myself by the fire here." The young man's face showed an expression of shame. "Does my politeness displease you? Do my words tire you? If you find me too boring, please forgive me." As he said this, he stood up, bowed deeply, and said goodnight to Christina; he was about to leave. Christina quickly called him back, and the young man sat down again. He said, "Let's not talk about this matter. It's fine for me to warm myself by the fire here tonight." Christina quickly stopped him; "No, no, I can't let you warm yourself by the fire here alone, I'll share the room with you." The young man, as if afraid that she would change her mind, quickly stood up and thanked her, and put an arm around Christina's petite shoulder, expressing affection, "I will do my best to make you happy."</p>
<p>The innkeeper, looking on, was extremely pleased and immediately led the two of them upstairs to the room, where a very flirtatious maid was kneeling on the floor, taking off their boots for them. After a while, the maid left, leaving the two of them alone in the room. They looked at each other, each feeling a strange and inexplicable emotion surging in their chest. Finally, the young Spaniard spoke, "My name is Don Antonio Yous, Miguel, Trapera du, Duke of Bivondele (full name), special envoy of King Philip of Spain, Aragon, Castile (Spanish territories)." After he finished speaking, he waited quietly for Christina to announce her official title and name. Christina hesitated for a moment, then reluctantly said, "I am the Duke of Du Hao." The young special envoy stood in front of the large mirror and began to take off his clothes, but he suddenly stopped. He said very boredly, "You must come to Spain to travel." Christina replied solemnly, "I would very much like to go." The young special envoy said, "You can stay in my residence, you can..." He suddenly stopped again, feeling that indescribable emotion preventing him again. (To be continued)</p>
