<h3>時評</h3>
<p>人與事敎</p>
<p>以不景氣爲口頭禪之今日。匍匐掙扎於飢餓綫上之無告人民。直不知幾千百萬。以一般事業之少而追求者多。欲覓一噉飯塲所。其難乃如登天。「人浮於事」之現象。已透現於社會之中下階級。而成爲深入膏肓之時代病。然由社會之中下階級而遞升至於最上層階級。則又有「事浮於人」之怪狀。大概階級愈高。而其弊亦愈顯。不平者乃問。「同是圓顱方趾。或則失業賦閑。束手待斃。或則優差美缺。應接不暇。如謂才智不齊。而窮通以分何以蓬門華户。儘殉佳士。而腸肥腦滿。却爲逹官。」平心而論。此種牢騷。非全無根。吾人深覺。時丁亂世。千孔百瘡。皆待彌補。然以迫於現實之困難。不能不分緩急輕重。卽如今日「人浮於事」與「事浮於人」之二大畸形現象。過猶不及。兩無所取。然欲求矯正。則後者當尤先於前者。一則因「人浮於事」之問題太大。整個解决。談何容易。再則因「事浮於人」之弊。最顯於上層階級。而上層階級之措施。如有失當。其貽禍必遠過於中下層階級。可以斷言。三則因上層階級。對於凡百改革。皆當身體力行。以正天下之視聽。而爲常人之楷模也。然而吾人屢見當世之大人先生。一身兼數要職。刻板式的開會集議應酬奔走之生活。已佔其大半時間而去。而其公餘游息所需。或更過於常人。一日之光陰有限。一人之精力無多。顧此失彼。在所難免。惟以其不能面面俱到。乃往往將其名義上應盡之若干職責。諉諸其親信。親信假其名以行。恃有特殊之淵源在。又往往上下其手。營私作惡。其甚焉者。仍復轉諉諸其本人之親信。層層假託徒。苦小民。而究不知誰握大權。誰負眞責。蒙害者固屬冤枉。受謗</p>

<p>何氏報告詞云、「西路軍在江西方面剿匪、日有進展、僅餘蕭克匪股、因在贛巢穴盡失、不能存在、乃不得不出而流竄、以圖生存、西路軍一聞蕭匪竄出、卽抽調團隊前往各縣堵截、一面調軍跟剿、匪衆竄湘的、約有五六千人、槍約三千枝、專走偏僻小路、抄入湘境、沿途地方藏匿、符號旗幟、假稱湘軍回防、迨至汝城桂東、經守碉的團隊查覺、始知確係蕭匪竄湘、比卽急調軍團、分别堵追、查匪的企圖、係欲出湘省經川黔、用極迅速飄忽的行動、乘虚流竄、不與國軍接觸、所幸匪的企圖已明、有一定方向可追、現正派隊嚴切追剿、祗要遇見我們的軍團、接觸一下、遲匪一二日的行程、則我們的部隊、卽可趕至、很容易的將蕭匪在湘境消滅、這是蕭匪最近之流竄與國軍追剿大槪的情形、</p>
<p>關於各縣報災事件、上星期二日、報載本人談話中、曾經言及、最近各縣報災與請急賑之文電、仍絡繹不絶、上次談話中曾經講過、縣長與各公法團請領急賑、是不曉事與圖分賑欵者之所爲、鄕民聚衆坐吃排飯、是地痞藉風生事混水捉魚者之所爲、且旱災非如水災之臨時無措、縱令有些地方、禾苗盡屬枯槁、因時令未至、亦尚非食新谷之時、在未屆靑黄不接的時期、何至要頒急賑、何至坐吃排飯、本年湖南各縣、固然是有些地方遭了旱、但就目前荒象而論、尚有救濟方法、因爲受災縣份、可以補種雜糧、而濱湖各縣、又已比較豐收、只要大家不跟着圖分賑欵的官紳與藉風生事的地痞去閙荒、相信不至於荒、湖南全省僅七十五縣、現已報災與請賑的逹六十餘縣之多、因其中有許多是揑報不實、反使眞正受災的縣份、受其影響、尤其是各縣官紳、祗知文電紛馳、報災請賑、而對於補救方法、竟未見一人言及、可見各縣官紳、對於人事之疏忽了、現在關於旱災事、省府以及省賑會各機關、均已呈報中央請賑、將來自有整個的救濟、惟各縣官紳、今後務須注意補救方法、並不要揑報災情爲要、講到祈雨、固然不是不可作的事、但是本人曾經講過、是注重内部的革心、以感召天和、并要本着齋戒沐浴的「齋字眞義、不要糜費、早兩天聞長沙市民恭送陶李二眞人回宮情形、倍極熱烈、但未免過事舖張、陶李二公果有知覺、見市民糜費太多、一定是心感不安、此外據報還有些街團藉神歛財的、則其人的心術、更不堪問了、總之、欲感召祥和、首先應力求人事之應善、可謂盡人以合天、然後才能天人合一、湖南方面、講到人事、情形極爲複雜、尤其是楚人多謠、喜歡無事生風、例如最近各報所載第四路總部經理處長張慕先·與財政廳長張開璉辭職、以某人繼任、并謂某人又力辭不幹云云、繪影繪聲、像煞有介事、其事不僅本人并不知有其事、而謠言之來、恐怕張廳長張處長二人、自己亦莫名其妙、這是對於人事不善的方面、隨便舉個例證、總之、只知敬神祈福、而不能盡人事以求天人合一、還是不能感召祥和、又心善還要事善、又如敬神祈雨、原是心善、如果祗知敬神、而放棄一切人事、或因祈雨而建壇打醮過事舖張、都是心善而事未善、我們要知道災雖天降、然確由人造、如果能够本着「盡人以合天」與「心善還要事善」兩個原則、努力以赴、一定可以感召祥和、减輕災祲、」（二十三日）</p>

<p>孔氏演詞云、「今天承各界同胞、熱烈歡迎、本人確承受不起、但從今天起、將憑着最大的决心和勇氣、在蔣委員長領導之下、來爲復興中華民國努力、以及爲羣衆謀解决痛苦而剿匪、所以今日各界同胞歡迎的盛况、只得大膽地接受了、現在將今日要說的話、分爲三點、（一）赤匪總崩潰的原因、（二）本人對剿匪所貢獻的意見、（三）回答各界同胞歡迎之方法、茲分述如下、（一）共匪總崩潰的原因、就是共産主義不能實行於中國、因爲中國没有資本家、只有大貧和小貧、根本談不上階級鬥爭、所以共産主義在中國、根本就行不通、此爲共匪總崩潰基本原因之一、其次、共産黨所利用欺騙羣衆的烟幕彈、完全暴露了、共産黨所號召的對象、是工人·農人、所號召的方法、是分田·共産、但是實際情形怎樣呢、在匪區裏面的工人、每一個星期中、要吃自己的飯、替公家做四日工、工人只有痛苦享受、没有利益享受、農民方面、當初分田、雖然稍有利益可是到了現在、痛苦就不堪言狀了、照今年情形說、每人平均可分得租榖五石、但僞蘇維埃政府、已實行借租三次、每次一籮、二次共去了一擔、又有節制運動、每人借租一籮、各種捐稅、又須抽一籮、此外還有其他種種削剥、每人所得的五石租榖、差不多被僞政府剥削去了三擔、並且每人還要在一週内服公差四日、農民不但没有絲毫的好處、而一層一層的痛苦、只見加重、工人和農人、現在已知道赤匪的欺騙政策、人心動摇、此爲共匪總崩潰的第二點、再其次爲國軍封鎖政策加緊、匪區裏的糧食油鹽和軍用品、日見减少、匪區羣衆、得不到物質享受、一致對蘇維埃政府的不滿、一個個不斷的逃出、向國軍投誠、這是共匪總崩潰的第三點（二）對於剿匪意見、剿匪的責任、是個個同胞都應該負起的、不但大家應該明白消滅土匪的方法、並且要進一步防止以後土匪的發生、要知道土匪産生的原因、就是土匪抓住了民衆的弱點、民衆的弱點在那裏、在文化敎育程度的落後、分辨不出土匪的好歹、所以土匪得大施其煽惑工作、此外土匪初起時、大家不把他立時撲滅、也是原因之一、現在要消滅土匪的辦法、在政治上、要組織民衆、提高人民的敎育程度、使人民可以揭穿土匪的麻醉欺騙等手段、而不致盲從、這樣從思想的改革、方是消滅土匪的根本辦法、至宣傳方面、亦應注意、如本人在未投誠以前、所聽到的、是說凡是投誠到國軍裏面來的、都被殺掉、致許多有志投誠的人、懷疑不敢前來、現在本人到了這裏以後、才明白過去都是赤匪的宣傳作用、國軍寛大爲懷、不但不殺授誠的人、就連俘虜、也很優待、我們今後要能够把共匪這種宣傳工作消滅、便是做到了剿匪一個重要的工作、其次、我們要明白匪的力量是什麽、是羣衆、如果匪没有羣衆的話、便一點力量也没有、所以我們爭取羣衆的工作、也是一個重要問題、如果工作做得好、使羣衆脫離匪的關係、則匪不平自平矣、以上爲剿匪的政治策略、關於軍事方面、我十二萬分的同情於蔣委員長的政策、只消用穩打穩紥的方法、便是赤匪的致命傷、在坐各位、今後務必要擁護蔣委員長、按步就班做云、此外土匪怕飛機、怕封鎖、怕我們的堡壘政策、至堡壘政策一項、尤應格外嚴密、務使土匪不能逃出、則剿匪工作、方可一次肅淸、以上數點、爲大概的介紹於各位之前、其詳細辦法、本人將用册子寫出、以供剿匪之參考、（三）回答各界歡迎辦法、今天各界熱烈歡迎、我眞是歡欣得很、今日勇敢地接受下來、將來怎樣回答各位呢、只有不顧一切、在蔣委員長領導之下、抱着犧牲的决心、來做復興中國、解救羣衆消滅赤匪的工作、最後我大聲疾呼、要憑我人的勇氣和决心、去消滅赤匪、以報答今日各界歡迎之熱忱、」（八月二十七日）</p>

<h3>顔顧兩使昨晨同輪抵滬</h3>
<p>當日卽晋京謁汪轉贛謁蔣</p>
<p>顧觀察日俄戰禍不致爆發</p>
<p>中央社云、我國駐蘇俄大使顔惠慶博士·駐法公使顧維鈞博士、上月間分赴靑島避暑、迄已匝月、茲以溽暑已消、故於二十六日、由靑島偕乘怡和公司和生輪來滬、該輪於昨晨五時抵滬、顔使抵滬後、略事休息、卽乘早車入京、願使則於當日下午四時乘滬平通車晋京、並定今晨離京赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長、茲分誌其各情如次、</p>
<h3>昨晨同輪抵滬</h3>
<p>和生輪於昨晨四時進口、五時停泊順泰碼頭、下輪後、顔使卽逕赴顔福慶寓所略息、旋卽赴北站、乘坐早車晋京、知者甚鮮、顧使返麥根路私邸、略事休息後、於九時許、驅車赴祁齊路、訪晤全國經濟委員會常務委員宋子文、晤談逹一小時之久、旋分訪友好、於當日下午四時、乘坐滬平通車入京、晋謁汪院長、並定今晨赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長、</p>
<h3>在靑未談政務</h3>
<p>顧公使抵滬後、卽在寓所、接見往訪之中央社記者、發表談話云、本人因天氣酷熱、曾一度中暑、故赴靑避暑、現已痊愈、而全國經委會當委宋子文氏、及駐俄大使顔博士等、亦以溽暑迫人、蒞靑小住、因同處一地時常晤面、致引起外界之猜度、甚至謂本人等在靑舉行會議、討論外交問題云云、殊堪發噱、蓋本人等赴靑、係不約而同、晤會機會雖多、但所談者均係私事、絕未涉及國家政務、更未討論外交問題、</p>
<h3>繼任外交不確</h3>
<p>顧使對外報、傳汪院長以行政院政務繁忙、將辭去外長兼職、由顧氏擔任一節、表示不確、且云汪院長未有辭去外長兼職之意、中央對外交部長亦絕對無所更動、外間傳稱、均不可靠、顧使繼又謂、本人此次乞假返國、大部份係料理私務、返國後、因中暑、卽赴靑島避暑、諸事均未及料理、故回任日期、現未决定、大約尚有一二月之勾留也、</p>
<h3>觀察日俄問題</h3>
<p>關於日俄最近形勢緊張問題、顧氏不欲詳加伸說僅謂、日俄兩國、最近因中東路問題發生許多糾紛、但據本人觀察、兩國戰禍、不致立卽爆發、本人極企盼其勿開戰端也、至於美國政府此次提高銀價、收買現銀、引起外界猜度、而認美國收買現銀、係積極備戰云云、亦係一種推測、惟悉美國産銀豐富、居世界第二位云云、</p>
<h3>當晚赴京轉贛</h3>
<p>顧使最後又稱顔大使已於今晨（卽昨晨）早車入京、至本人此次入京、專係晋謁汪院長、關於外交等情形、晤面時當然有所報告、并以自返國於茲、迄未與蔣委員長晤面、故决定抵京謁汪後、卽赴贛晋謁蔣委員長、關於使外情形等、將面加報告、顔大使是否同行赴贛、尚未决定云、記者繼又向顔大使左右探悉、顔大使决定抵京謁汪院長後、赴贛謁蔣委員長、然後返京、換車赴天津、料理私務、再赴北平、入恊和醫院診治心臟病症、何日回任、當在其病症醫愈後、因心臟病不宜居於天氣較寒地帶、俄境天氣嚴寒、甚於我國也云、</p>
<h3>比王專使强森昨日北上</h3>
<p>駐滬比總領亦隨往</p>
<p>比王來和保三世、特派來華報聘專使强森男爵一行共八人、前日蒞滬後、業於昨日下午四時、乘滬平通車、北上遊歷、將先至徐州、然後轉隴海路至鄭州、轉車赴平、比使館參贊兼駐滬總領事譚爾夫、昨亦同車偕往、</p>
<h3>糧食委員會限制米價</h3>

<p>行禮如儀後、首由主席張秉輝報告、略謂、本會第四十二次常會决議案、均已分别呈報社會局、特呈市府核辦、惟迄未奉批、以致前議訂購洋米一節、目前尚未進行、本市社會局以鑒於本市米業自動訂購洋米者、爲數甚夥、如果漫無限制、將來新榖登塲、定貨湧到、勢必造成榖賤傷農、此專應加防範、尚有各委員亦有報告、從略、</p>
<h3>决議要案</h3>
<p>報告畢、卽開始討論、一·近日各地旱災、形勢嚴重、以致米價步漲、誠恐將來發生米荒、應如何擬具預防救濟辦法、祈討論案、議决呈請市政府轉呈行政院、令飭湘皖浙各省政府、按照國内米榖流通成案、不得有禁米出口、及徵收護照捐情事、以便調節民食、（說明、最近湘省徵收護照捐、每石一元、皖省禁止蕪湖米出口、浙江禁止温台州米出口）、二、本市米價、以來源稀少、求過於供、致河米市價、有超過前定價格、要否重行規定、並將頭二三號各定標準價格、以資遵守、而免取巧、請公議案、議决、訂定特頂粳米不得超過十三元五角、中次照標準價、分别訂定、呈請社會局布告、再嚴厲執行、</p>
<h3>討論情形</h3>
<p>昨日出席委員、對於限制米價一事、爭執甚烈、一部份委員、主張對於特頂米價、不必加以限制、次下米價則加限制、另一部份委員、以目前米價之高漲、多由於交易所及金融界操縱、故限制米價、事實上並無效果、應由當局嚴厲取締投機者之操縱、討論該案時、並有人說明洋米入口、不但無補於米價抑平、且將造成將來米市之恐慌、故討論該案、約費二小時以上之時間、仍未得具體之辦法、據聞該項爭執之發生、對於米業界内部利害之衝突、有極大關係云、</p>
<h3>吳桓如談</h3>
<p>會議散後、中央社記者、對於限制米價、詢諸市社會局第二科科長吳桓如、據談、以本人（吳氏自稱）對限制米價本不主張、現自規定標準後、事實上仍有超過此數、但米業界、亦因礙於成本、實有不得已之苦衷、故本人曾主張由商人訂購洋米、所購洋米、將來於出賣時、應受政府監督、如有虧本、政府當酌量給予津貼、如將來米價過高、以此流通市塲、抑平米價、但此說現已難於實行、蓋湘米每年原有二千萬石、供給他省、皖贛兩省、亦有多餘、惟今年因受旱災影響、除湘省尚有多餘外、其他各省、均感缺乏、而福建一省、素無餘米供給他省、而今年閩南大熟、爲數十年所未有、但以今日情勢而論、國内米價之漲落、决不以國米之産量多寡爲斷、蓋於國外産米區域之是否豐收、影響甚大、如民國十九年時、國内米價飛漲及二十元之譜、但不久因洋米傾銷、國内新米登塲、米價卽見狂跌、故以本人觀察、今日國際間雖以美國及印度亦受荒災影響、需求於他國、但西貢仰光等處、尚屬豐收、國内雖受旱災影響、但亦不若外傳之盛、故當此新榖登塲之際、米價或可不再高漲、且能回跌、亦屬意想中事、惟至明年靑黄不接之時、勢將發生米慌、屆時如無準備、則民食一事、其恐慌情形、更爲我人料想所不及矣、</p>
<h3>李景縱昨返滬</h3>
<p>歐亞航線進行順利</p>
<p>歐亞航空公司總經理李景縱、爲急謀恢復新疆航線、實行貫通歐亞航空起見、特於本月廿一日由滬赴甘與甘省主席馬鴻逵等、商議恢復計劃、得有圓滿結果、李氏於昨晨九時回滬、承告華東社記者此行結果甚詳、茲分誌如次、</p>
<h3>此行頗爲順利</h3>
<p>李氏首稱、中央爲開發西北急須完成西北交通、且歐亞航空、亦以西北爲中心、故中央曾命本公司航行蘭州至寗夏段航綫、惟自前月十五日、開始航行後、營業不見起色、故本人乃於二十一日飛甘、與馬主席商議積極政策、業已得有圓滿結果、請示交部朱部長後、卽可實行、内中有一條、爲甘省府極力間直援助者、爲自後寗夏至包頭一段航綫、能通行後、所有該綫沿路所産名貴貨物、卽可由飛機載運、卽可免除損失、而多一種運費之收入、减輕公司負擔矣、</p>
<h3>滬新恢復困難</h3>
<p>至於行駛上海迪化間之滬新綫、停頓以來、迄將一載、本公司固時刻計擬恢復、因盛督辦至今無積極表示、致本公司殊難着手、盛督辦若有電招致本公司商議、本人當卽刻赴新、截止目下、本公司雖致電數十通與盛督辦、奈盛氏一無覆電、故極難進行恢復云云、</p>
<h3>即將晋京報告</h3>
<p>本公司所訂之二新機、本預計在本月底可抵滬、因滬新綫恢復困難、故已展緩進行、本人此次赴甘、因氣候關係、故回滬時、留停二天、昨晨由蘭起程、至洛陽卽停止前進、今晨五時半起行、九時抵虹橋機塲、本人俟朱部長由贛回京時、卽赴京報告此行經過、以便早日實行寗夏蘭州包頭間之航綫云、</p>
<h3>劉湘辭職赴渝汪已電川慰留</h3>
<p>軍事金融均稱穩定</p>
<p>各軍尚未表示態度</p>
<p>申時社云、四川剿匪總司令劉湘、突於本月廿三日晨、携少數隨從、出成都東門、逕返重慶私邸、並留函囑分電中央呈辭本兼各職、值此川省匪患未淸、劉氏突然消極、影響非細、申時社記者昨特往訪劉氏駐滬代表鄧鳴階·傅眞吾·二氏、承告汪院長業已電川慰留、及先後各情如次、</p>
<h3>出走經過</h3>
<p>據二氏談、劉氏態度消極、事先雖亦曾略有察覺、然不料其如斯堅决、據成都來電、謂劉氏于廿三日晨、率少數隨從、出成都東門而去、總部督署各項職務、由郭文欽·李劍鳴·兩參謀長、分别代行、一時踪跡杳然、風聲所播、羣情驚訝、軍事亦暫呈停頓、後經發現劉氏在重慶郊外李壩子私邸中、經各界領袖懇切籲請、當經劉氏口頭允許、在中央未批准辭職以前、决設法維持、</p>
<h3>辭職原因</h3>
<p>記者旋詢以劉氏突然辭職之原因、據稱、劉氏爲人沉毅、勇於負責、非至萬不得已時、絕不致消極、此次遽然出此、自有其不獲已之苦衷、惟剿匪軍事頓挫、各軍將領、不能一致共進、致在萬源同江一帶、反勝爲敗、尤爲劉氏所最痛心、</p>
<h3>汪電慰留</h3>
<p>二氏續談、汪院長已有覆電致劉慰留、言詞懇切、而川省告界、亦亟盼劉氏早日復職、</p>
<h3>各軍態度</h3>
<p>柳傅二氏、並答記者謂、自劉離成都後、雖曾引起一度驚擾、但旋卽平復、現剿匪軍事、仍由五路軍與赤匪相持於□□間、</p>
<p>金融亦尚穩定、至各路軍事領袖、對於劉氏辭職、驟失領導中心人物、自不免於焦急、但未有具體之表示云、</p>

<h3>儲滙局本年度收入儲金大增</h3>
<p>共計三千三百萬元</p>
<p>投資國家生産事業</p>

<h3>儲金增加</h3>
<p>徐副局長語記者、儲匯局本年度收受儲金共計三千三百萬元、較廿一年度二千五百萬元、約增百分之三十一、各區均有增加、而陝平冀閩等處、則均超過平均增加數、陝西約爲百分之一百四十、北平爲百分之八十、河北爲百分之六十五、福建爲百分之四十五、上述數區、在上年度内、或以天災流行、或因地方不靖、社會經濟、均有不安之現象、而儲匯局存欵反見增高、可知人民對郵儲局之信心、已見增高、而局方爲維護儲户之利益、自當擇最可靠最有利之途、從事投資營業、徐氏卽談及</p>
<h3>投資目標</h3>
<p>謂在以前各任局長、大部從事房地産及政府債劵等投資營業、自唐局長到任後、卽改變目標、不再增加不動産等投資、而從事於國家及社會建設事業之投資、如最近滬銀行界存受之鐵路建築借欵、該局均以最優之地位参加投資、至報傳該局將試辦江浙兩省農村貸欵事、據談、以前曾有此意、前任副局長程士範、並曾往隴海路沿綫各地視察、計劃從事、旋以各分局辦理放欵、恐難勝任、故卽擱置、現有廿萬元存儲江浙農民銀行、在名義及手續上、爲同業往來性質、局方需欵、隨時可提出、惟農行業務爲農村貸欵、故實際上亦有恊欵救濟農村之意義、</p>

<p>該局現更擬投資郵局、建造各區郵局辦公處所、蓋郵局現有局所五千餘處、而自建房屋者、則僅五十餘處、房屋旣狹小、且須年納巨額租金、故儲匯局擬投資建造、已得郵局同意、將以四年爲期、先行投資五十萬至一百萬元、建造較大局所多處、按月付還本息、至償淸後、局所卽歸郵局所有、乃再進行第二期建造、大約須一二十年、始能將全國局所建造完成云、徐氏奉令參加九月一日在京召開之全國郵政會議、定今晚先行晋京、唐局長則定三十一晚晋京云、</p>

<h3>華絲衰落之際美國交易所允開拍</h3>
<p>經紀人通過下月四日可實行</p>
<p>各廠維持爲難亟盼政府救濟</p>
<p>我國絲業衰落後、華絲歐美市價暴跌、絲廠維持乏術、政府已進行設法救濟、紐約市塲、允開拍華絲、將定期實行、新聲社記者、昨晤絲商領袖褚慧僧氏、承告詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>華絲開拍</h3>
<p>美國紐約市塲交易所、開拍廠絲、歷來均爲日絲、我國及意大利絲、素不開拍、前曾要求、施因華絲等級毫無標準、故未蒙允許、此次意大利絲紐約市塲交易所已允開拍、我國要求援例辦理、今交易所已允所請、惟須俟經紀人投票表决、如通過、則定九月四日實行、</p>
<h3>日占第一</h3>
<p>美國市塲華絲受日絲傾銷影響、目前日絲占第一位、華絲占第二位、意大利絲占第三位、每年總銷約六十萬擔、如華絲開拍成事實、則華絲在美便有活動可能、目前華絲外銷仍寥寥、Ｂ字等級二十至二十二條考每擔爲四百二十元、但無大宗交易、以成本計算、依然虧本、</p>
<h3>推銷問題</h3>
<p>關於華絲推銷等問題、褚慧僧曾與沈驊臣聨合擬具計劃、建議設立統制廠絲推銷恊會、日前與國際貿易局長何炳賢接洽後、實部决先組推銷機關、向國外推銷、至於整個計劃、允再加以考慮、惟絲商因國外絲價較國内低、故要求整個計劃同時進行、俾以國内盈餘、彌補國外之虧、</p>
<h3>維持乏術</h3>
<p>江浙各地絲廠、因連年華絲外銷衰落、無法維持、相繼停業殆盡、勉强維持者、目前截止、浙江爲十八家、江蘇約二十八家、上海已不滿三十家、如絲價依然低落、則各廠勢將無法維持、而總停業、絲商所期望者、爲政府設法救濟、</p>

<h3>新稅則施行後日貨入口數額激增</h3>
<p>七月份增加二百餘萬元</p>
<p>其中以糖及魚介爲最多</p>
<p>自進口新稅則施行後、於我國對外貿易上不無影響、本月份對日貿易之實况、想更爲國人所關心、新新社記者昨特趨詢國際貿易局統計處專員王伯顔據談、本年七月份對日貿易、進口額計九百五十六萬七千七百餘元、出口額計六百六十四萬八千餘元、與往年同期比較、入口增加二百餘萬元、出口則减少八十餘萬元、與本年上月比較、入口方面亦見增加、　　出口方面則大見减退、（計减一百二十九萬餘元）故在貿易平衡上、由上月之一百六十萬元入超增至二百九十一萬餘元、與往年同期比較、則相差益遠、蓋去年七月份、對日尚出超二十五萬餘元、本月份入超之激增、雖云由於出口之低落、但施行新稅則後、日貨進口之旺盛、亦未始無關係、若就進口主要日貨數額上研究、則更可加强此種論斷、本月份</p>
<p>業於昨晨四時三十分左右、在霞飛路白賽仲路附近荒地上發現、經越捕查見、報告法捕房、通知公共租界捕房前往、會同察勘、則見該車後面泥板等已損壞不堪、車中並無遺物、乃將車中所現指紋等、逐一攝影、帶回存案、以便追緝、一面通知該車行將原車領回、</p>

<p>减低稅率（如新稅則對於魚介進口稅率减低甚大、最高者减落百分之三十五减落最低者亦逹百分之三·四、）似不無影響也、至於對日出口貨、本月份内除肉類及礦砂兩項外、其餘商品如棉花棉紗骨等、均較上月及往年同期减落、綜觀半月份對日貿易、出口異常衰敝、進口則似有方興未艾之兆、而魚介海産品進口之趨增、尤足予國人漁業一大打擊、深望國人予以注意</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>怎樣奮鬥</h3>
<p>讀書指導；</p>
<p>前兩星期看到你們論「私生活與理想」的一篇文字引起了我對於我的私生活的懷疑。現在姑且將我的私生活一部份檢討一下，雖然這是屬於個人的，但至少有不少人患着同樣的病，那末這個病變成通病，就亦非要請敎一下不可。</p>
<p>「一個人僅僅抱有一個高尚的理想，還是一個空想。你要爲這目標云奮鬥，這理想才會變成爲眞正是你自己的，纔能變爲事實。」一件偉大的工作僅僅以「奮鬥」兩字來包括一切，未免太不能使人了解，而且奮鬥的方法，過程，並没有提出更詳細的解說與指導，未免使人懷疑到奮鬥兩字，不過是安慰詞，正像用一塊糖塞在號哭的小孩嘴裏，實際還是空洞，至少不過是爲成功者一個冠冕而已！</p>
<p>在歷程上，環境所左右人的思想前進與後退很太，在方法上講，應該怎樣去克服那像狂浪打進危壩的一霎？這裏我舉出三個普通的例子；</p>
<p>（一）性的煩悶｜一個靑年在適當的年齡，是需要相當的性的安慰，當然，不僅僅限於性交。但在所謂封建又深的社會制度裏，靑年們能有正當的解决嗎？我不相信一個靑年不需要性，或者没有適當的安慰後，亦就平穩的過去了。這時也許會走入歧路，亦許不敢走入壞道，竭力用理智來克服感情，在這個時候，簡直除了像痴人終日感覺乏味，永不會再有别的好方法可以來安慰，除非讓牠的高潮自然的退下去。</p>
<p>（二）生活的出路｜顯然的，社會上給人們最大的號召是生存，所以人們爲了生存，要同自然界爭，同獸類爭，就是人同人鬥爭，亦是爲了生存上的問題。這本來是一條路軌一樣。現在我們没有了飯吃，或者感到將要没有飯吃，這時，不起來爭尋嗎？不錯，社會是整個的，一個人没有飯吃，决不單祗是一個人没有飯吃，這裏有不少將要變成餓殍，别處更多着呢！研究自然科學與社會科學都是没有出路。當然人不會等死的，這時除了像老虎般四出搜尋食物外，再也不會想到其他問題了。假若說他是一個想爲大衆謀生活的人，他知道將來的偉大的工作更待着他裝滿智識學問去盡力呢！我不知道他應該怎樣去先做呢？</p>
<p>（三）刺激的神經｜這是說受了不同感覺的刺激，使他不安工作。一個爲經濟壓迫者而自殺了；幾個不滿二十歲靑年爲了某種緣故而槍斃了……失地幾千里，日兵人演習，外國人無緣無故打了中國人的耳光……這此消息給人們怎樣的刺激。受了刺激的人，會不會很安然的視同不聞？</p>
<p>綜合以上的三者，造就靑年們最大的煩悶，這不但阻碍他的前進，並且消磨了他的意志。不錯，能够克服者就是成功，反則就是失敗，也許就會墮落：是的，克服，奮鬥，俱是絶對好聽的名詞，我不知應該怎樣去利用他才對。</p>
<p>我的私生活方面也是　　例子。我旣感到現實不滿，也感到血腥的污穢氣味！我要求自己的滿足，也即是先要求到大衆的滿足。在大衆没有滿足·自然·自身也决難有滿足的希望。我要盡力擠到大衆生活隊伍裏去，才先要磨練我自己的筋骨，訓練我的學問，我永遠不想在我的職業技能上去求得謀一點生活的工具。所以我先求文學，繼之社會科學，以及鍜練身心，但所謂環境的推動，决不能安然的處在漩渦裏不爲所動。在性的渴求時，我不敢墮落，我就悶坐一天，受着外來的刺激，就飯也不吃，睡他一天，這是避重就輕，爲的是專心我所要的學問，可，是生活的壓迫怎樣辦呢？起初，不去想他，可是，一天一天的擠進，我開始要變爲餓殍了，我不得放棄文學，或社會科學，專心去謀養生的技能，這亦算奮鬥的失敗嗎？我自信我有力，有年紀，儘管好學着呢？三十四十五十甚至六十歲再幹不會嫌晚吧！這一切我都很明白，但我始終不克服像波浪起伏的靑年煩悶，牠給我的打擊，阻礙，是更大的。我可應該怎樣去奮鬥呢？張厲君來函。</p>

<p>李士廉聰了，眞是討厭：他又恭維洋鬼子。不過自己坐了他們的便宜車子，可不好意思駁他。就掉轉臉來向張介夫道：這個地方，自然，是到西安去的咽喉路徑。東邊來的貨物，只要是用車子裝的，我想無無如何也離不開這個地方。若是在這橋頭上，設個徵收落地稅的局子，一定是很好的收入。張介夫笑道：那末，你到省城裏以後，向主席上個條陳罷。李士廉却也不知道他是眞話呢？或者是俏皮話。只得報之一笑。於是大家都感到無話，倒靜默了幾分鐘。那兩個德國人，量了一會子，橋工就也回來了。他們且不回坐位，在手提籃裏，取出兩個玻璃杯子，兩瓶啤酒。他們也帶有開酒瓶的夾子，僕的一聲拔了塞子。兩人靠了車門站定各捧了一隻玻璃杯，各翻轉瓶口，嗆啷啷向杯子裏倒着酒嚮，只見白沫上湧，酒氣順風吹了過來。張介夫眞不忍看，掉過臉去，向灞河裏看着。心想，今天到了西安，什麽先不忙辦，且買兩瓶啤酒喝了再說。心裏想着，便咽下兩口吐沫。好容易兩個德國人過了啤酒癮，這車子才繼續前進。遠遠望見大平原上，有一道離地而起的黑圈影子，那就是長安城了。再繼續的前進，在半空裏現出兩個亭亭黑影來，這便城牆上的箭樓。李士廉道：據這個樣子看來，大概長安城還不算壞。張介夫道：且不問他壞不壞連電燈也没有的地方，恐怕也好不到那裏去。李士廉道：我到了潼關，我就後悔不該來。但是旣然來了，馬上就回去，人家不會說我們怕吃苦，倒會說我們找不着事。（七）</p>
<h3>曼殊爲什麽可愛？</h3>
<p>— 夫凡</p>
<p>近代中國文學史上，蘇曼殊眞是一位人見人愛的詩人，現在的新文學對於他也頗歡愛惜與敬仰：他本來祗是一位鴛鴦蝴蝶派的舊文學家：卽算他的詩才淸麗動人，但總不該佔了如許重要的一頁，但是爲什麽受到這許許多多的人如此隆重的敬禮呢？這自然有他的道理在。</p>
<p>蘇曼殊的小說寫得很好，然而總不能呌做大成，他的智慧，自然造就了他的文學生涯，｜｜尤其是他的不幸的遭遇，從酸辛的眼涙中，他獲到了詩的題材及最高妙的意境，｜｜「聰明」，大概是少年人所共有的，但可愛的曼殊，並不祗聰明，他的梵文典的成功和英文學的根抵，都是他自己刻苦用功換得來的。</p>
<p>尤其覺得可愛的，是他的浪漫的氣質：彷彿有人問過孫中山先生，問他崇拜的人有没有，孫先生說：「我崇拜兩個和尚，一個是蘇曼殊，一個是太虚法師。」後來那人又問他到底誰淸高，孫先生說：「我愛蘇曼殊的恬淡。孫先生就任臨時大總統的時候，稍爲有點歷史關係的人誰不去找他？惟有我們這位曠世薄命的詩人，孫先生却遍尋不獲。曼殊的孤芳自賞，眞可算是純粹的詩人了。</p>
<p>天下滔滔，士衆矣！然而有幾位是有氣骨的？有幾位是澈底的超人？</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陶玨）</p>
<p>人生最最是銷魂夜，别後相逢第一宵。一久别重逢，倍覺親暱，勝於新婚多多，未曾經歷者，斷難道其萬一。</p>
<p>淸某詩人句云：「笑將紅袖遮銀燭，不放才郎夜讀書。」不讀書，又待怎麽生？一笑。</p>
<h3>菱</h3>
<p>— 席同初</p>
<p>陣輕風，把河水刮起二三分高，　　盡圓形菱葉在昇沈動蕩。直連河底的長莖，附滿了水棲小動物，有時有幾隻螺獅吸在上面，把葉子拉下水去了。河中央綠葉叢中，傾頽了若干焦枯老葉，有的紫，有的灰，有的黄，大概菱是成熟了。</p>
<p>幾個小弟弟慫恿我去採菱。</p>
<p>採菱船端正完畢。那是一隻大浴桶，大可容二人，從水橋石板上滑了下去。端弟回過頭來；「你敢下去嗎」？哈……一陣歡笑聲。六弟坐下桶去作起示範來，左右進退，祗兩隻手在隨隨便便的撥撥。「衡哥！你要向左時，撥右手，向右時左手，身子坐在後面些，讓前面可安置菱。」說着，又照樣划了一番。於是他們按住了桶邊，扶我下去。自己，佇立在水橋上，看了我驚慌的神情，呵呵作笑。</p>
<p>茫茫的心理，怕桶子載不起自己的身子，一仆下去，菱莖纒住了脚手，那不是玩的。但他們在不斷地鼓勵我：「膽大膽大！不妨事的，不妨事的。」我頭都不敢一側。</p>
<p>眼看碧綠的小葉片。傾着肩在桶下挨過去了，桶子穩穩地；我的膽，放大了不少，於是也想轉轉灣，兜兜圈。</p>
<p>兩隻蜻蜓雙雙地停下我的小舟，我掬股水潑去，他們仍翹起了尾巴停着。蜻蜓！你深認水中便没有來害的你嗎？你的命運實在不濟呀！我一伸手，他們中一隻給握住了。</p>
<p>岸上起了噪聲：「給我！」「衡哥給我！」「我給你扶桶的，給我」………</p>
<h3>拚命的進行</h3>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我們在豐台站上所吃的一頓晚餐，也是很富有嚴重性的，第一個原因當然是因爲這一餐乃是上車後的開首第一餐，而且晚餐照例又是每日兩次「大餐」中的一次：於是那一百碗的正菜，便像宮中一般的送上來了。這些菜都是裝在一種木製的大匣子裏的，如果在尋常的火車上，那些車門必然是太小了，必不能容許這些碩大無朋的食匣子通過：幸而我們這一列御用火車上的門户，都已重新改造過，差不多已大過了尋常的一倍。於是每當進餐的時候，好幾十名太監，便在外面的月台上，排成了很長的一行，打那代表御膳房的那兩輛車上起，一直排到太后這一輛車上：所有那些滿裝着各色山珍海味的食匣子，便像小學生所做的授木棍的遊戲一樣的從第一個太監，依次傳授過來，約莫要隔上四五分鐘，才授到站得和太后的餐桌最近的那個太監，｜｜這人十九是張德｜｜就由他把匣子裏的菜捧出來，安在桌子上。這些匣子的外面，都用金子一般鮮明的黄色油漆漆着，再加上匣子裏所裝的碗盞，又都是很好看的磁器：同時那些傳遞食匣的太監，也各穿着五顔六色的公服，因此，單這上菜的一幕，已是很美麗動人的了！可惜除掉那些愚得可厭的官吏之外，旁的人便不用想見到這樣的好戲。</p>
<p>待到我們的第一次晚餐完畢以後，太后便敎人傳令出去，吩咐開車：於是我們便繼續給這一列黄色火車裝載着，慢慢地望天津行去。（一一六）</p>
<h3>西瓜皮的慘劇</h3>
<p>— 蔚記</p>
<p>西瓜，在消暑飲料中，眞是價廉物美，所以在中等人家，是一種最好的消暑品。</p>
<p>咱們的中國人，最是不講衛生。吃完了西瓜，就把瓜皮扔在街上，弄得滿街都是蒼蠅。</p>
<p>近來，我的家鄕中，發生了一件關於西瓜皮的慘劇，現在我來把這事記在下面：</p>
<p>在我們的村上，住着一家只有母子二人，子是捉魚過活的，幼年喪父，由母親養大，母已六十多歲，故甚孝其母。</p>
<p>今年的夏天，他的母親在夜間受了些寒，便生病了，他請了一個醫生來，開了一張藥方。便到鎭上去配藥。</p>
<p>不料他配了藥回來。在一家門口，被西瓜皮滑跌了一交。他的頭直撞到這家的階沿石上，撞得頭破血淋。</p>
<p>過了幾天，他竟傷重而死，他母親也上弔死了。</p>
<p>一下子，母子二人被一塊西瓜皮弄死了。</p>
<p>所以我勸諸位吃了西瓜後，切不可把瓜皮扔在街上。</p>
<p>并且把西瓜皮醬了吃，味兒也很美的</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>蘇州雜話</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>乾隆是考古家　蘇州的西面，有一個大市集，呌滸墅關，出蓆，是馳名遐邇的。那邊　　所省立女子蠶桑學校，成績很好，影響於江浙的新蠶業很大。因此滸墅關的聲譽更高。但是人們坐火車過滸墅關的，差不多没有一個人不把「滸」字念做「許」字的，就是蘇州人也如此。照字書說，應當讀如「虎」字，像尚書「率西水滸」最顯然的是施耐庵的「水滸傳」了，誰會稱他水許傳呢？據蘇州人的傳說，是乾隆皇帝下江南的時候，從無錫到滸墅關，老頭子問這裏是什麽所在？傳從官奏明了。老頭子問怎樣寫法？傳從官寫給他看。他把「滸」字只認得三分之二，識他「許」字，因爲是出於金口，便流傳了。老百姓只好暗地裏笑他識别字。」</p>
<p>可是吳地記說：「秦始皇因巡海，經闔閭墓，欲取其寳劍，忽有白虎當墳而踞。始皇以劍擊之，不及，誤中於石，其虎西走二十五里而没，地裂爲池，因名其地爲虎璆。至唐諱虎，錢諱鏐，改名「許市。」後人譌舊音，於「許」字加水爲「滸，」市爲墅云。」那麽滸墅關的名詞，也是後來的人纒誤附會而成，考究他的原名，倒是應當稱許市關的。乾隆這老頭子，倒是一個考古家，不能說他「識别字」呢。</p>
<p>蘇州有一句俗語：「關上（讀如浪）二小姐。」意思是說這人有些「滿不在乎」的。我問過關上人，也說不出他的來源。這位二小姐尊姓芳名，也無從查考。但是蘇州人對於這一句話是說慣的。别地方的人聽了，一定莫名其妙。</p>
<h3>馮夢龍的滑稽</h3>
<p>自從日本人鹽谷温，把「三言」從亂紙堆裏捧了起來，馮夢龍便常被人提起了。容肇祖在嶺南學報上寫了一篇「明馮夢龍的生平及其著述，」把馮氏的輪廓，已畫得狠淸楚了，因爲他喜歡批評小說，整理小說，寫作小說，所以有許多滑稽的事情，流傳到現在。</p>
<p>他是蘇州人，蘇州人擅長說俏皮話，做游戲文的風概，是自古已然，於今爲烈了。馮氏曾作彈棉花槌謎云：「一物身長數寸，頭圓頸細無毛，佳人一見手來撾，揭起羅裙戲耍，席上交懽無恨，聲音體熊嬌佳，看來俱是眼前花，直弄得成胎便罷。」這首詞在表面上狠猥褻，可是底子裏却把彈棉花槌形容得眞堪絶倒。</p>
<p>還有一首嘲長妓的黄鶯兒說：「仰面覷妖嬈，出蘭房，須曲腰，粉牆半露花容貌，也不是雲妝髻高，也不是繡鞋底高，拜如折竹因風倒，好姣姣，太湖石畔有個女曹交。」文人輕薄，自是慣枝，可是說到絶妙處，令人啼笑不得。</p>
<p>蕉窗閒話載：他去取笑一個夤緣補廩者說，孔夫子絶糧於陳，命顔回到回回國借糧，回回國不允。再命子貢去，云孔夫子說過，「賜也何敢望回回。」可見我對貴國很恭敬的。回回國大喜，以白糧擔送他，子貢歸告孔夫子，孔夫子攢眉云：糧便騙了一擔，可惜文理不通。挖苦得可以。</p>
<p>馮氏的著作很多，「三音」不易　見，還是看今古奇觀罷。像「喬太守亂默鴛鴦譜」的一齣趣劇，｜｜就是平劇的梵王宮，不是滑稽的作家，那裏寫得出？或者當時是事實，早爲社會所傳稱，可是有滑稽的天才，纔能在人生中揀取滑稽的斷片，寫成滑稽的作品。</p>
<p>漢書東方朔傳：「後之好事者，因即奇言怪語，附著之朔。」可見馮氏的滑稽不止此，而有些滑稽，不盡屬於他的。</p>

<h3>優游杯决賽大出冷門王文正勝林寳華</h3>
<p>｜六比一·六比二·六比一｜</p>
<p>王文正異乎尋常表演特佳</p>
<p>林寳華抱恙登場勉强應戰</p>
<p>優游盃網球單打昨日錦標决賽之結果、竟大出意料之外、王文正以直落三擊敗林寳華、林偶攖小恙、抱病登塲、而王文正則適逢其會、表演特殊佳美、遂造成此冷門之結果、昨日羣以爲精彩必多、故趨優游體育會以觀者、逹二百餘人、景况甚盛、茲記情形如次、</p>
<p>正文正｛六比一六比二六比一｝林寳華</p>
<h3>王林表演</h3>
<p>王文正昨日之表演、確有獨到之處、出球有力、而其正反手抽球極少錯誤、平穩異常、而向林兩角掃射之球、使林艱於應付、在林因有小恙、不能奔跑、於是全局比賽、遂犧牲於隨隨便便之中、且臂力亦失其把握、出球甚少管束、自殺觸網之球、纍纍不可計、乃有此没精打彩之局面、</p>
<h3>决賽一瞥</h3>
<p>林上塲失於太大意亦有之、第一盤王先勝二局、林得一局後、王左右逢源、連下四局、以六比一先勝第一盤、第一盤各一各二、在林竭力思加振作、終覺心與願違、王又連下四局、第二盤六比二、第三盤林已成弩末、無能爲力、四比零時、才得一局、最後王以一記極妙之邊線球、避過林而以六比一再勝第三盤、全局共計只費五十分鐘、</p>
<h3>寳華談話</h3>
<p>據林寳華君賽後遇記者、渠因爲毒蟲所咬、突發寒熱、曾請求改期、但報端已宣告、亦祗有勉强應戰、王君今日表演、確實佳妙、即使未病、亦難應付云、據優游會總幹事陳邵君談、謂林君請求改期、因未述及有病、故未准之、否則必爲之設法以補救也云云、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗多頭陣綫動摇</h3>
<p>近期敲破八十元關門</p>
<p>紗市續疲、因現紗銷塲益覺暗澹、多頭心神愈難安定、兼之蜀中匪患猖獗、棉紗交易頓告缺乏、人心軟弱、金融界吸收之額、視環境不良、斬結甚夥、紗市就實需而論、殊爲凋敝、所以九月份敲破一百八十元大關、</p>

<h3>糧食粉市午後欲漲無力</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份均見鬆跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小四五六角不等、坎拿大小五六角左右、當開價時、各月份市面、又復續跌、本月份曾低至五角三分半、其餘月份、較前日收價、計落二三分不等、惟二盤後、市氣已轉盤旋、因本月份空頭、亦以市價低疲、從事抵補、遠期空户甚少、買氣尚活、致勢成互擯、上落有限也、迨至下午開盤、市氣呈反漲之態、本月份因有小廠掉期交易、喊價步堅、大廠之籌碼、聞亦有少數抵進、人心遂亦復振、至十一月份以下、雖較上午微好、但以套售之故、人心終覺略軟、故結局仍見小面也、結果本月份祗好五厘、九十月份小二厘五、十一月份小七厘半、十二月份小一分二厘半、一月份小二分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>本麥廠銷仍不動</h3>
<p>｜期麥市下墜｜</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份均見疲落不堪之勢、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、小去四五六角不等、至市塲人心則因粉銷甚寂、業内外之買氣、亦拘束乎不前、至内地帮則以各處已見甘霖、人心亦已見鬆、故上下午各盤、交易雖未甚暢、惟市氣則異常鬆軟、較之前日、仍回跌甚勁、觀此後市面、當以粉銷之榮枯、再定升沉也、結果本月份續跌一角之巨、十月份跌八分、十一月份跌七分、十二月份跌五分、現麥市面、亦呈不穩、以市存甚豐、廠胃不貪、急於脫手者、祗好受殺、故各檔較之前日、又跌六七分不等、開徐州山東歸德碭山麥三元九角七分、蚌埠麥三元九角半、寳應麥三元九角一分、計一萬三千包、出福新阜豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>河下米滯銷跌三角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮源較多、計共有三十餘號、（貨共四千五百石）而銷塲更復呆滯、包胃有靑島帮出手動動、卒數僅百數十包、無濟大局、各貨行情續跌三四角不等、杜洋尖及陰元則賴貨乏站定、新粳方面除廠東新缺貨、仍守老盤十二元外、其餘河下貨做開旣稀、而價亦貶落二三角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來盤七八號、市上各貨去胃淸淡、市形白粳高貨價小角許、中次削二角强、白元薄稻羊埠尖價小一二角、客尖平疲、東新粳價仍平定、新客尖車運稍有、零化平常、價開十一元一角、</p>
<h3>期洋米突落四五角</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、又見變化、客秈機砶米到頭略有、且被洋米抛售影響、貨主頗願脫手、故除一部份特高貨外各小一二角、惟糙秈尚爲内地貪辦、到數並不見多、昨市尚能站站、但自申價報漲後、各地均在裝運中、如今明到埠一旺、市價或須跟小也、全市開各秈六千包、盡由内地辦去、</p>
<p>昨日期洋米有行家回出、因連日價高後、日前進貨多已賺錢、且洋商日前訂定者亦隨市求脫、回籠貨與新交易互相爭售、後市價即見突落、午後進户觀望、内地因得雨而胃呆、市面立形不支、西貢一號九月份降小至五元四角半、比昨市跌小三角、（一石須小四角半）十月十一月晨間尚開價至五元八角、午後至五元五角半、最後五元五角亦無人收受、二三月份小絞亦小至五元五角半、現貨小紋亦小二三角、西貢貨乏站住、但路貨西貢已小至十一元六角、亦小去半元左右也、二號西貢昨日初次成交、價開大元六角云</p>
<h3>翻陽新夾靑豆上市</h3>
<p>｜價開四元六角｜</p>
<p>昨市九江鄱陽新夾靑豆、第一批運到一百三十一包、價開四元六角、由寗波帮辦去、今庚出、品比往年見優、其餘新豆因前漲風時引起販運户趕辦來申、故近日到源勢湧、市態不免趨軟、去路亦見减縮、統市計成交城門豆二百餘包、珠溪豆七十三包、都昌豆三十七包、柳芳池豆三十包、惟漢口早黄尚能多銷、因貨品較佳、故市穩定、其高檔金皮豆已開至四元二角二、白皮豆亦開三元九角半、共計交易六百餘包云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲銷進展難</h3>
<p>歐美生絲市塲、現絲價雖漲、而存底充厚、銷用不暢、滬埠黄白廠經等去電不轉、一般囤户手中揑貨、尚無受主、囤胃沈寂、昨祗英印等莊進白廠經二十包、粗黄絲十五包、價仍平定、</p>
<h3>雙宮繭滬存不弱</h3>
<p>雙官絲印需殷繁、滬埠福綸·鴻綸兩侵宮絲廠工作繁忙、原料銷用激增、存底漸薄、滬埠各洋棧雙官繭共存不滿五百担、故價獨呈堅挺、</p>
<h3>路莊珍眉交易尚旺</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、英商怡和洋行、又復大舉搜辦、錦隆同孚等行、亦均有零星進胃、全市成交共逹二千二百餘箱、交易尚不寂寞、惟售開市盤、因國外來價苛緊、人心疲軟、依然有跌無漲、此外針眉秀眉兩項綠茶、去路亦略形活潑、惟大帮綠茶、美銷依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白到稀存薄</h3>
<p>｜步升二角｜</p>
<p>昨日糖市以二四粗砂白前日到貨僅一萬二千餘袋、又值存底軋缺、故前昨兩日間步漲二角之譜、公會劃盤現貨劃十九元九角、碼頭交貨十九元九角八分、轉口貨六元六角半、惟後市仍須轉鬆、如下月九日可到之貨、昌興開出一千餘包、價爲六元五角、新規外稅、荷赤現貨十四元九角、轉口貨五元七角、無上落、太古糖Ｂ嘇二十元一角、好起五分、本廠綿白振裕一號十八元八角、振記一號十八元九角、均升一角、本廠中袋三號冰百餘袋二十二元九角、興化白開數十包、十八元半、次貨十八元一角、片靑號家意思稍鬆、呌小二角、爲十一元六角、但仍乏成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭花子正水登塲</h3>
<p>爲數較多…降去三元許</p>
<p>蘭花子因頭水貨出數不多、高貨曾到四十七八元、旋告斷檔、茲正水貨又見續出、但出數依然不盛、據漳州訊、僅有百數十擔、故價不能過鬆、昨到七十餘箱、當即開通、較之頭盤降去三元　許、</p>
<h3>五金小廣皮缺貨陡漲</h3>
<p>｜七尺東鐵新貨將到｜</p>
<p>小廣皮爲搪磁廠熱水瓶廠等之切需品、近來客礰如靑島天津北平諸帮亦下手添配、但市上到貨甚鮮、致存底奇缺、故標凖陡起漲風、現市每擔估十元零五角、比前漲五角、但副號貨祗售九元五六角、因有破碎關係、各帮均少添購、故市面依然平定、擴業中人傳出消息、謂此貨下月六號將有三千餘擔可到、</p>
<p>七尺東洋白鐵、因貨缺價漲一元三角、聞新貨明後日將有二萬餘張可到云、</p>

<h3>遍地的職業</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>最近有兩個朋友，都是剛從學校出來的　，在上海住了兩個月，又都去外埠了。來上海的目的，是謀事，去，似乎應該是謀事未成，然而剛相反，他們都是棄職而去，而且在所棄的現職之前，還曾有一二件事弄到手過。</p>
<p>關於他們謀事，辭職的經過，我不想發表朋友們的私事。他們的經過給我感到的是，内地人所迷信的上海遍地是職業，並不怎樣錯誤，不過能給人以些什麽職業，是很可思索的。</p>
<p>不幸自己是受過相當敎育的人，我只能知道學校出來的人將遇着什麽命運。中學生（畢業的，下同）出來不難找到二十元一月的事，大學生可以得加倍的報酬。這定價似乎有相當根據，如果通常一個大學生是須多化二千元的成本製造出的話，依投資利益的計算，確只能每月多受二十元的利息。類推，凡未曾像中學生樣化過千餘元的成本的，自然只能僅有飯吃。也許，中學生的報酬，說是以學徒待遇作根據算出來的。</p>
<p>我願意接受某先生的說法，認這樣待遇，可算公平，得有這種機會，應該滿足，如果竟不屑就，就是自趨絕路，理應失業。</p>
<p>然而中學生，大學生的被定爲這等價格，似乎是很近的事，而且還不十分普遍。如果眞是公平的話，是不是應該一體推行，以消彌不平等的現象。又中學生，大學生旣是應得這樣公平的報酬，將來的學校是不是能如某職業學校的廣告所云，凡畢業後不得職業的，由學校給以每月二十元的津貼。（這是僅就中學生說的。）</p>
<p>恐怕職業市塲的跌價，也正如貨物市塲的跌價一樣，買主在得以廉價購入以後，反要求更廉的低價。並且買主的控制物價，遠不及僱主的控制從業員的價格的能够任意。中學生，大學生如果承認現定的價格爲公平，購買者一定會以爲這價格還是優待，說不定價格馬上又要再落下去。</p>
<p>其實這「說不定」一點也不是過慮。不滿足於二十元一月的待遇的中學生，現在就不多。因爲屈就的人已很多，所以某大旅館的侍應生訓練所，竟能招到好多中學生作受訓練的侍應生。這結果引起了一位實業家的靈感，正想招一班小學生訓練作茶房（侍應生）：而且聽說有一間中學，正是在下訓練管理｜｜比侍應更漂亮的名詞｜｜輪船客艙的人才。</p>
<p>我决不以爲作茶房是職業的墮落，雖然現在茶房的服務性質另包含一根本問題。然而如被誘惑到願意去做茶房，我總以爲是受了欺騙。至少有一部份人現在還覺得茶房這職業與高尚職業之間，有一界限，不幸辦訓練所的那一班人，正屬於那一部份。他們試探得就業者所能屈就的程度以後，必引致職業市塲的買價的再低落。</p>
<p>自然失業問題非常複雜，因不甘屈就而失業的人，其實只是失業大羣中的一小部份。無而如提出這一部份作爲問題，當我想及上述的情形時，就覺這班失業者倒是可愛的。不恥小就的道德，我們早已有了，認識自己，有所不甘，這精神是很不容易培植出的新芽。這新芽是不免有人在設法摧殘的，但自然的生長力總能使他從奮鬥中走出來。</p>
<h3>京派的起源</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>大約是百一居士的壼天錄罷，說到北京除夕故事，載著某孝廉的除夕自撰聨語：</p>
<p>「放千枝爆竹，把窮鬼轟開，數年來，被者小奴才，擾累俺一雙空手。</p>
<p>燒三炷高香，將財神請進，從今後，願你老夫子，保佑我十萬腰纒。」</p>
<p>原來北京雖在淸朝末年，國運不濟，還是很繁華的，政府官吏要擺空架子，商店居民也要擺空架子。比方拿舊歷過年來說罷，闊人愛熱閙，大放爆竹；窮人没飯吃不要緊，爆竹是不能不放的，好像不是這樣，就不配住北京。百一居士說到這一點，還很津津有味，京派的味道，算他領略到了！</p>
<p>本來是闊人，裝出一幅寒傖相，固然大可不必；本來是窮措大，裝出逹官貴人公子少爺模樣，就更覺不堪。還有，自己大有面子，固然不必驕傲；借他人大面子來驕傲，又何苦來？「三保大人親口駡我忘八蛋，」難道這還可以誇嘴？魏忠賢是你乾爺，難道就算你沽了光？然而擺空架子的，講假塲面的，愛虚名的，究竟不少，林語堂先生痛駡的傖夫俗子，假如存在的話，該是這等人了。</p>
<p>自己想做聖人之徒，不免造出一個道統，把堯舜禹湯文武周公孔子之道，傳給自己的老師，他們的衣缽纔算歸了自己。自己想做文豪，不免造出一個文統，把周秦諸子到明季公安竟陵都認做言志派，於是文壇上言志派獨尊，自己就算繼承了言志派的正統。推崇古人，原爲自己沾光，欺騙世人，盜竊名譽，伎倆不算不巧，手法不算不高了。</p>
<p>自然，墨子也說過這樣的話：「愛人如己，己在所愛之中。」可是把這個作爲沾光的方法，也有用得很笨的。比如你本是南方的瘦子，却偏愛捧北方的胖哥兒，自己也穿上寛袍大袖的衣服，自以爲是胖哥兒黨，這就未免笑煞人了。又如北京雖然做過幾百年的國都，破銅爛鐵當然屯集了不少，倘若把它拿出來向人炫耀，說這就是京貨，自己自命識貨，破銅爛鐵雖未必增價，說話的人自己該覺得太難爲情了罷！</p>
<p>破落户的子弟，愛誇祖上家當。暴發户的人，也想抬出幾個有面子的先人。做了文人，就不能不述祖德，不能不誇天才，從屈原以來，就是如此，那也不足怪。天才無憑，自然可以瞎誇。祖德難於假造，也許還是盤瓠氏之苗裔，家族淵源是說不過去了，只好誇師友淵源。詩哲是我的同伴，博士是我的朋友，學者是我的熟人，名流我曾拜訪過，他們都曾住在北京，我也屬於京派了。這就是京派的起源。</p>
<h3>太白遺風</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>門外文談</h3>
<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（五）古時候言文一致麽？</p>
<p>到這里，我想來猜一下古時候言文是否一致的問題。</p>
<p>對於這問題，現在的學者們雖然並没有分明的結論，但聽他口氣，好像大槪是以爲一致的；越古，就越一致。不過我却很有些懷疑，因爲文字愈容易寫，就愈容易寫得和口語一致，但中國却是那麽難畫的象形字，也許我們的古人，向來就將不關重要的詞摘去了的。</p>
<p>「書經」有那麽難讀，似乎正可作照寫口語的證據，但商周人的的確的口語，現在還没有研究出，還要繁也說不定的。至于周秦古書，雖然作者也用一點他本地的方言，而文字大致相類，即使和口語還相近罷，用的也是周秦白話，並非周秦大衆語。漢朝更不必說了，雖是肯將「書經」裏難懂的字眼，翻成今字的司馬遷，也不過在特别情况之下，採用一點俗語，例如陳涉的老朋友看見他爲王，驚異道：「夥頤，涉之爲王沈沈者」，而其中的「涉之爲王」四個字，我還疑心太史公加過修剪的。</p>
<p>那麽，古書裏采錄的童謡，諺語，民歌，該是那時的老牌俗語罷。我看也很難說。中國的文學家，是頗有愛改别人文章的脾氣的。最明顯的例子是漢民間的淮南王歌一，同一地方的同一首歌，「漢書」和「前漢紀」記的就兩樣。</p>
<p>一面是｜｜</p>
<p>一尺布，尚可縫；</p>
<p>一斗粟，尚可舂。</p>
<p>兄弟二人，不能相容。</p>
<p>一面却是｜｜</p>
<p>一尺布，暖蓬蓬；</p>
<p>一斗粟，飽童童。</p>
<p>兄弟二人不相容。</p>
<p>比較起來，好像後者是本來面目，但已經删掉了一些也說不定的：只是一個提要。後來宋人的語錄，話本，元人的雜劇和傳奇裏的科白，也都是提要，只是牠用字較爲平常，删去的文字較少，就令人覺得「明白如話」了。</p>
<p>我的臆測，是以爲中國的言文，一向就並不一致的，大原因便是字難寫，只好節省些。當時的口語的摘要，是古人的文；古代的口語的摘要，是後人的古文。所以我們的做古文，是在用了已經並不象形的象形字，未必一定諧聲的諧聲字，在紙上描出今人誰也不說，懂的也不多的，古人的口語的摘要來。你想，這難不難呢？</p>

<p>倒床已經一星期了。頭痛發熱，除了有時感到口渴要喝點白開水外，終日只是昏沉沉地閉着眼。</p>
<p>亭子間内特别顯出陰森，没有人跡，也没有聲響。就連自己的痛苦的呻吟，也不願驚嚇自己，儘讓在心弦上撼動。</p>
<p>這是孤寂！</p>
<p>這是飄零！</p>
<p>然而，我没有這樣想。</p>
<p>我不時反復着來看過我的朋友們對我說的話：</p>
<p>「你的臉色大難看了。</p>
<p>「你趕快到醫院去看看吧。</p>
<p>「你不要這樣糟蹋你自己。」</p>
<p>我眞是糟蹋我自己嗎？我决不！我還要生活，我是十二分珍重我自己；我也知道我的病很深，需要進醫院，不過，我現在没有錢，没有錢，我只有回答：</p>
<p>「再過幾天看吧。」</p>
<p>這並不是欺騙人以至欺騙自己的話，我實在有一個希望，希望等到那接受我的文章的書店發下稿費來。｜稿費是我的救命星，這不是妄想，發稿費是有定期的。</p>
<p>「就在這幾天，」是着急，是安慰；這樣遷延下去，一天，又是一天……。</p>
<p>「砰！砰！」樓下有人打門。</p>
<p>没有人響。</p>
<p>「阿黎，開門。」人在呌了。　　我靜聽着，疑心是來看我的朋友。於是，勉强爬起床，披上睡衣，極力支持着身子向樓下走。我的週身由熱而忽冷起來；我的手足在打抖，我的嘴唇在顫動，但我畢竟掙扎着開了門。</p>
<p>「你……」！朋友一望到我的臉便驚嚇起來了。</p>
<p>「逹！進：進去吧」。我招呼着，牙齒在交戰。</p>
<p>「怎麽病到這樣？你就不要下來囉！請醫生看了没有？」逹一面扶着我上樓，一面口不停地說。</p>
<p>我不願開口。</p>
<h3>弟弟（三）</h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>媽正在氣得發戰的時候，弟弟恰巧又在外邊惹了禍回來，媽的打自然就更加不客氣了。媽一面哭一面打：</p>
<p>「你怎麽不爭氣呵！」</p>
<p>「啊喲啊喲……」</p>
<p>「你怎麽變成了人呵！」</p>
<p>「啊喲啊喲……」</p>
<p>「你怎麽……」</p>
<p>「啊喲啊喲……」</p>
<p>起頭看的人都覺得好笑，漸漸的看見媽越打越認眞，弟弟的聲音也没有了，就只聽見板子在屁股上淸脆的聲音。</p>
<p>這一回，媽才離開堂屋的時候，弟弟就不見了。頓時全屋都驚嚇起來，提着燈籠四處分頭找去。媽急得臉發白，幾乎瘋狂，看見那些街隣幸災樂禍的臉色，好像說周家那寡婦出了「報應」了！於是漸漸都圍了上來：</p>
<p>「跑了嗎？」</p>
<p>「跑了！」</p>
<p>「怎麽跑了？」</p>
<p>「哦！跑了！」</p>
<p>媽聽見這些聲音，幸好不曾昏倒下去。媽哭着悄悄向我說，她後悔她不該錯打弟弟了。好容易到了第二天上午才在母舅家的堂屋門背後找着，硬拉了回來。從此以後，衆人就給他取一個呌「蠻子」的綽號了。</p>
<p>弟弟的確有一股蠻勁兒。他常常嘲笑我；因爲我是曾經過繼給大伯母承祧了的。所以弟弟有時在受氣之後見我笑他，就粗暴地喊道：</p>
<p>「滾，滾，滾回你家屋裏去吧！」</p>
<p>雖然我感覺到好像受了侮辱，但我只好讓他。我有時候眞怕他用那粗暴的拳頭打上我這瘦筯筯的身上的。</p>
<p>「嗯，嗯，不要臉，賴着吃人家的飯！你闊，這新衣裳還是我家的！」他再這麽說的時候，我也眞的就要馬上脫下衣裳，負氣地跑到大伯母那兒去。可是媽又把我拉着了。她呌我不要信他的話。她說我是兩邊的兒：他是「蠻子。」</p>

<h3>火線在中國</h3>
<p>— 徵</p>
<p>記得我十幾歲時，在小學讀書，曾看見一本日俄戰爭的寫眞畫册。當時因爲他畫得十分美麗動人，我曾很靜心的一頁一頁看下去。裏面畫着許多日俄戰爭時的戰塲情形，日本軍艦擊沉俄國軍艦情形，塲面都是非常壯嚴偉大，或是兇險得怕人。而最使我至今不忘的，則有一頁描寫日本兵蹂躪中國人民情形。裏面寫着幾個日本兵，在一個中國人家庭裏，實行姦淫搶刦。女人跌在地上，小脚蹺得高高，中國男人被日本兵拖着辮子往外擲。滿室桌椅翻亂，傢具器皿，跌了一地。我當時看了很有點氣憤，又有點傷心。中國人爲什麽要這樣受日本人欺侮呢？再則，日俄戰爭，爲什麽受害的却是中國人呢？這些問題，我當時當然無從去找人解答。及後，年紀大了，讀到日俄戰爭史，才知那時的日俄戰爭，完全以中國東三省爲戰塲。中國政府懦弱，只有任他們兩國在那里胡作胡爲的。現在時過境遷，雖然已有十餘年，但這幅十分悲慘的景象，却深深還的印在我的腦筋裏。</p>
<p>從日俄戰爭到現在，總計不過隔了幾十個年頭。現在，新的日俄戰爭，又要在我國東北爆發了。雖然這一戰爭，意義與前次的日俄戰爭，已完全不同，卽日本仍是一個帝國主義國家，而且是一九二九年以後的帝國主義國家，卽資本主義最後階段的帝國主義國家，而俄國却變成了一個社會主義國家，反資本主義反帝國主義的國家。這一戰爭，是日本從反對蘇聨中去尋求他自己的出路，而並非如前次日俄戰爭，是兩個帝國主義，爲爭奪遠東權利而起的戰爭。然而有一點却是與前次日俄戰爭相同的，就是戰塲仍是在中國。日本進攻蘇聨，他必定要假我國東三省作戰塲，同時，他爲維持後方，又必借中國地方，作爲他後備的倉庫。這樣，中國的受蹂躪，就更要百倍於前次的日俄戰爭了。</p>
<p>日本進攻蘇聨的戰爭，其危機是一日緊張一日了。戰爭不久就要開始。我們究將何以自處，</p>
<h3>被阻的旅人</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>十七歲那年就被迫走上生活的旅程。</p>
<p>這旅程是幽長的，能一股勁兒跑到盡頭的很少很少，大夥兒總是跑累了倒斃在中途。追隨在後面的人便踐踏過死屍往前程奔，那死屍被踏扁，糢糊，而不久，就湮殁啦。一個職業的旅行者的結局，就是這麽一回事。</p>
<p>被踏扁，糢糊，湮没｜就是這麽一回事呵。</p>
<p>「疲乏了呵！疲乏了呵！」在生活急流中帶着喘息嘶喊着，不能停一步呢，生活的駕御者揚着長鞭緊跟在背很，時間的巨輪飛滾在前面，預料總有一天會跌出生活的旅程的｜卽使不倒斃在中途</p>
<p>可給預料中了。</p>
<p>那天，正在奔跑中給投來一根「絆馬索」似的，抹着汗珠，緊縮着心，讀着經理的信：」啟者，本公司近因營業不振，維持爲難，爲大局計，不得不節省開支，裁减人員，ＸＸ部下月起將併入ＸＸ部，請君另謀高就，一俟公司略見發展，仍當儘先錄用也。此致ＸＸ先生ＸＸＸＸ公司經理Ｘ。」這不是撤職書嗎？又讀了一遍，撤職書依舊是撤職書，心坎的火山爆裂了！</p>
<p>世界就要在眼前沉淪似的，天亦暗下啦。</p>
<p>木偶似的站在寫字桌前，用牙齒緊緊地咬住下嘴唇，眼前的一切都是殘酷的，只有那座Reminton，那架筆座，那隻鉛絲籃，却扮着離别時依依不捨的臉，它們陪伴着我在旅程上終天，終月，終年的急奔着，現在，被阻的旅人是不需要它們了。從資本軌上跌落下的隕星哪。</p>
<p>「安息一回吧！」</p>
<p>「安息一回吧！」</p>
<p>從此，我不用五點半起身：不用怱忙地梳洗：不用擠在一號路牌的十八路無軌電車三等車廂裏：不用躱在門房裏吃油豆腐粢飯：不用押着卡車從火車站到輪船碼頭，從輪船碼頭到堆棧，曬着六月的太陽，冒着十二月的風。</p>
<p>從湍急的輪廻中旋轉過來的，從段落的旅程上奔跑過來的，給生活的鞭子揍着追趕着時間的列車！</p>
<p>「疲乏了呵！安息一回吧！」</p>
<p>可是，人不能離開生活的，我不能再依靠家庭啦，我不能再依靠年老的爹媽過日子啦，雖然，他們亦見我精疲力盡而願意我安息一回。年老的爹媽不一樣的在湍急的生活輪廻中旋轉着嗎？他倆在人生旅途上比我更走的疲乏了，或許，馬上就要被踏扁，糢糊，湮没。</p>
<p>我不能安息，我要生活啊！跌了下來，依舊得扔上去，一個職業旅行者不能長久的被阻在旅程上，卽使你明明知道總會有一天奔跑得精疲力盡，倒斃在中途，被踏扁，糢糊，而至於湮殁。</p>
<p>可是，活着的人總不能不追求生活。</p>
<h3>看護姐兒</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>戴白帽子，穿白衣服。活像一個孝女！每天的心境，總是覺不着愉快的。</p>
<p>她所接觸到的，全是些哭喪了臉的人。</p>
<p>可是，看護姐兒喲，在護士室裏是你們笑出涙來的時候哪！</p>
<p>不要緊的！病室裏在按鈴，你慢慢的去得了！</p>
<p>病人的心兒煩燥而咕嚕啦！</p>
<p>她嗔了眼珠子，不高興的走開咯。</p>
<p>一回，二回···一百回····二百回的鈴子按下去。她不理會你！</p>
<p>有一個看護姐兒。</p>
<p>她的洋字寫得很好！洋話也說得很快。性情是怪好的。對於自己的職務，一點兒都没有忽略的。可是她的臉上都是皺紋！</p>
<p>她常常喜歡逗遛在病房裏。</p>
<p>她没有笑臉哪。</p>
<p>「見鬼啦！」在黑夜裏瞧見她，不熟悉的人們一定會這樣喊。</p>
<p>她是高個子。三角形的臉。二顆眼珠子，陷在眶子裏，深深地。一條條的皺紋，多可怕呀！</p>
<p>她呌「密斯李！」有些人們，是這樣的稱呼她：「老小姐。」</p>
<p>當别人招呼她的時候：背轉身去，她總是用手帕去拭她的眼睛。爲的是怕眼涙掉下來哪！</p>
<p>「爲什麽你要哭呀？」快痊愈了的病人，不明白的問題。</p>
<p>「太太，現在我····還不能告訴你。你靜靜的養病吧！」</p>
<p>她不喜歡把自己的悲哀告訴别人。反正，悲哀不是别人分得去的。</p>
<p>在那位太太出院的一天：太太找到她，堅决的懇求她，要她把她的悲哀告訴出來。太太是很顧憐她的。</p>
<p>於是，她關上了病房的門，忠實的告訴那位仁慈的太太了。</p>
<p>幾個年頭前，她在外埠的某醫院裏，也是當一個看護。她同那醫院裏的王</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>醫師，發生了戀愛。···生了個孩子。後來她發覺他已經在故鄕結過婚了！心上帶着創傷的，她棄下了孩子，一個子飄泊到上海。已經有五個年頭了！一點兒確訊都没有。有的說：「你的孩子已死了！」</p>
<p>有的說：「你的家鄕和那王醫師，都給大水浸没了！」</p>
<p>家鄕，曾經被水淹過五個多月的家鄕。她没心回去了。王醫師别去提到啦！這樣，一天一天的磨難着，直到現在。</p>
<p>太太同情她這麽說：</p>
<p>「老小姐！有空到我家裏來玩哪！」可是没有把地址告訴她。</p>
<p>太太走了！</p>
<p>病人又一個個的呻吟着進來。伴着病人進來的人見，都是有一副愁容！</p>
<p>戴白帽子，穿白衣服的看護姐兒們。每天都忙着打針，配藥，量温度，···然而也忙着塗粉，揸胭脂，穿高跟鞋，提手袋，進電影院··········。</p>
<p>我們所見到的看護姐兒的心境，總是覺不着愉快的！</p>
<p>我們所想到的她們的心境，或許會同朱古力糖一般的甜，有味！不過，「老小姐」是例外的！</p>
<h3>孤獨者之歌</h3>
<p>— 秋月</p>
<p>三　夜行</p>
<p>夜色如水之悠寂凄淸，皎皎新月，對我微笑盈盈。呵！你，這自然底詩人。人羣底夜之母親！今夜你頻頻的倩笑，你是，我生命裏之最知音，夢裏的情人。｜｜你對於輕盈巧笑，你的心兒又汎泛着輝煌光明，普照我的前程·········</p>
<p>呵，星星們在竊竊私語，我聽出他們底由衷之聲。像情人的眼睛，藴藏着如火一樣之熱情，對我流盼頻仍。｜｜呵，我還聽見，我身傍有什麽在凄愴悲鳴？呵，那是他，小溪裏的流泉潺潺。唵！你悲咽低泣，爲是哀悼我底未來與旣往嗎？</p>
<p>啊啊！夜行者！㗒㗒，我這個孤零零的旅人！唵，可憐的影兒喲！唵，可笑的影見喲！你步步地跟着我，伴我的凄寂孤零，在這個天野裏踽踽獨行。</p>
<p>這時：野風蕭蕭，羣山已睡着了。叢林裏，遠遠處，飄來了鴟鵂的譏笑之聲，在笑着這個夜關更深的獨行人。</p>
<p>四　沙漠上的一個夢</p>
<p>啊啊！我是疲倦了，我是疲倦了！我從晨到晚，弗論夕也弗論朝，永踏着寂寞的步調，呵呵！到如今，我是疲倦了呀疲倦了！</p>
<p>朝朝暮暮，暮暮朝朝，我無終止的步調，踏過那些草原，那些天野，那些叢林與蹊徑。記也記不淸，算也算不明。聽不盡的是豺狼野狗的呼聲，瞧不盡的是魑魅魍魎之舞形。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>呵呵！剛纔我是睡了去嗎？怎麽一會兒又醒！呵！好夢呀！我願常在你夢裏温存：</p>
<p>好像是在一個不夜城：立體的建築物，萬朶熌爍的華燈，大街上，汽車，行人。一座巍峨的Apartment，水晶作了璇宮，璇宮裏，有着男的影，女的影，笑聲，比安娜，懷亞玲。我從這個璇宮走過，外面，又飄起了陣陣的比安娜，懷亞玲，笑聲，男的影，女的影。我被捲入這個流漩裏：身在摇震，手在舞，腿在行：身兒漸輕，脚又站不穩。我慢慢兒向上升，浩大的狂飈，把我吹上天頂，我飛過長空，渡過銀河，向着月球走近，作了一次月宮旅行……</p>
<p>五　薤露歌</p>
<p>已是夜深了！我一人獨自，在這荒凉的沙漠上：風在我的頭上號吹，砂礫在殺殺作響，無天幕爲我躱藏，無櫜駝作我防障。㗒，我這個沙漠上的孤行人！</p>
<p>天！讓我今夜在這裏安眠吧，我已不願意再回到那個人間了！那兒有地獄一樣的黑暗，那兒像屠塲一樣的悲慘。人類呀，祗是自私自利，互相爭奪與摧戕！呵！我曾在那兒發了些羞，在那兒發了些狂。記不住多少次數受了欺騙與愚弄。呵呵！我如今，我是永遠不願再回到那些人世間！</p>
<p>天風起了，砂在飛，石在響。啊，就讓我在這裏安眠吧！家庭，社會，於我還有什麽留戀呀？我是無父無母：無兄無弟：無姊無妹：無愛無親鄰。呵，我祗是孤冷冷的隻身！世人對我没有過問，我也得不得人世間的温存……</p>
<p>天！讓我今夜在這兒安眠罷，我已不願再回到那個人世間。</p>

<h3>山谷中的騷動</h3>
<p>— 奕</p>
<p>最後一次的火車，就要開出月臺了，第三次吹汽笛之後，老成才從五里多遠的Ｃ村趕到了車站。他平日總是很早就到了，還跑上那邊昇降機旁的草棚内去看看他那等着下地底去工作的兒子。今天因走路趕得太慢了，他只好拿起那竹筐，趕着火車，離開了礦山，到五里橋去做買賣。</p>
<p>火車開出已經是六點多鐘了，那黄昏的太陽，雖還拖着牠那紫金色的尾巴，在西方的天邊，閃耀着牠微弱的光芒。但那山谷中，却漸漸地蒙上了一層陰影，一切的景物都在筷糊了。</p>
<p>夜，撒開了牠的黑手，蒙住了山谷和平原，礦工們都到了地底下去工作，農村的人都已入了睡鄕。死寂的空氣，就籠罩着這四野的山谷。只有那礦山電汽廠的機輪聲音還轆轆的在喘息着。</p>
<p>夜已深了，陰曆十八九的月兒，才從那大煤山後，爬上來，她那雪白的光芒，如銀一般的蓋上了山川和大地。一件不幸而使整個山谷在這深夜騷動起來的事發生了。</p>
<p>一聲嚮亮之後，在那地底下通山上的烟囱，就冒出了縷縷的濃烟和火燄，一陣狂亂的呼聲，就從那地底下傳上了山坡來。</p>
<p>村莊中，街道上，一切已經沉入在夢鄕中的人，都給那巨嚮的聲音驚醒了他們揉開了睡眼，望着那冲出着火燄和濃烟的烟囱，驚訝的在等着那邊傳來的消息。但是每人的心中，都已知道不幸的事件是發生了。</p>
<p>「汽管爆炸，地下已起火了」。</p>
<p>消息傳過之後，一陣震動的聲音，就在這山谷中嚮了起來，在月光之下，那四面的田野中，街道上，就佈滿着成千成萬的人影，一羣一羣的向着礦山的出入口處包圍上來。只有一刹那的工夫，人的圈子已把四週攏住了。</p>
<p>哭聲，吼聲，呌聲，一切混雜的聲音，在這山坡上亂成一片。</p>
<p>汽笛拖長着聲音的怪呌，火車從五里橋帶來的救護隊到了火車衝開了人叢駛進月臺。</p>
<p>老成夾在人羣之中，從車上跳下來。他的心在跳躍，他的手在抖顫，他望着鐵閘衝去。</p>
<p>「老天，我只有這末的一個兒子了，大的死在這裏，次的也死在這裏，現在，現在他還得死在這裏嗎」？</p>
<p>老成站在鐵閘邊，滿身流着大汗，語調顫動的在呌着號着。</p>
<p>火燄仍在地底下冒上來，呼聲仍是在這山坡上騷動着。一直到了天亮，這山谷中才回復到了平靜的世界。</p>
<h3>雪齋雜語</h3>
<p>— 雪爾</p>
<p>我是喜歡秋天的，然而徧徧在這可愛的季節生起病來似乎有些不大那個。自己是個最謹愼的人，在夏天從不貪凉嚼冰，立秋後更是每夜閉窗而臥。但是爲醫生着想，要是這樣謹愼就大家不生病，這些醫藥專門學校裏製造出來的人材豈不要糟天下之大糕？雖然像我生病就從没有請敎過醫生：因爲我知道生病不一定是可怕的，能够安安穩穩休息幾天，就是病人獨享的權利。如果一生病就請醫生，一吃藥馬上就好，那生病太無意義了；何况延醫服藥的病人也有蹺了辮子的。</p>
<p>已經病了四天，每天分不淸早晨，晚上，我高興的時候就閉了眼睛睡覺，睡醒了東張西瞧。這間小小的屋子，雖然我住了整整兩個年頭，現在病在床上，卻被我發現了許多平時不注意的地方。譬如那天花板，平時就不見得抬起頭來瞧瞧牠，現在正是我眼睛首先接觸所在，我見那塊石灰剥落的地方很像一頂橋。一想到橋就記起鵲橋相會的故事，而兩邊角落裏的兩塊黑形就變了兩個人物；一個是牽牛的牧童，一個女人模樣的自然可說是織女了。我每天瞧着牠瞧着牠後來甚至於可以數淸喜鵲的只數，那牛郎織女又像在泣哭的樣子。這種偉大的發現只有在生病的時候。</p>
<p>牆璧門扇似乎是每天習見的了，但是一生了病往往是據了一付眼睛，平時看見的是一只狗，這時候可以變成一只貓，而且没有人和你爭論，言論自由在病榻上是做到了的，這不是獨享的權利嗎？</p>
<p>說了半天，都是指小病而言，讀者不可誤會。如其一生大病，那根本可以當他死人：因爲早已剥奪了人的一切權利，更何來這種獨特的享受？然而我生的是小病，再四天不好了更四天一定好了；不然眞是有些不大那個了。</p>

<h3>五家鎭上一件大事（八）</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>現在富公公進去了出來說，他老婆願意把花粉田劃給富生，被伍老太爺這樣一奚落，朱氏没有敎她丈夫更多的措辭，富公公自然是答不上話來了。</p>
<p>一時寂靜了下來，那聒噪的蟬聲又送進了這大廳。</p>
<p>大廳背後，朱全貴同他二個小外甥一探頭不見了。富公公正向内站着，他看得淸切。剛才被喚進去就被老婆一頓臭駡，說一個男人家一點没有說話的本領，動一動嘴全被伍老太爺罩住了。現在這僵局老舅再去報告，豈不是雙脚亂蹦？富公公想到這些，更不知應該怎樣答話了。雙手儘自搓着，汗珠已從額角兩旁太陽穴直淌下來，下意識地舉起窄小的袖管去揩拭；他全忘了這件天藍夏布的海靑是進考那年特製的，平時是很難得穿出來的。</p>
<p>衆人都碳同相覷着，覺得這件事情已到了最重要的關鍵了；就是想啟口的人，也恐怕一句話而破壞了全局。然而那位馬首是瞻的伍老太爺却安閑地又舉起水烟袋來抽烟，張得福鼓了幾次勇氣想催伍老太爺說句决斷的話，他好放下這件心事，但恐功虧一簣，終没把這眼前的僵局在窒息的氣氛中延長下去。</p>
<p>朱全貴的頭顱又在大廳後出現了，他向妹丈招招手要他進去，富公公故意低下頭去裝做不看見，他已受不住内外的夾攻了。他像衆人一樣希望伍老太爺判决了他的罪名罷。</p>
<p>其實伍老太爺也並不是認眞地在抽水烟袋，他借着這空間在籌劃定案的方略了。因爲他是五家鎭上的法官，他的話不能隨意胡來的。不然，他要失去鎭上的地位，權勢。</p>
<p>「富明，」他緩緩地啟口了「你没有話說了罷？這件事是你理缺，你想你二弟死了十多年，以他們母子倆的生活，負下這許多債：就你所說的幾次兵災荒年，總不致於短少上代傳下來的數目……」伍老太爺停了一口氣，舉起鵝毛扇來輕輕地揮着「現在姪媳旣願意把花粉田塡補，我也不計較什麽蕩田不蕩田了。就是富生討親時所負的債項也並不多，你原式原樣的交還了弟媳，也對得住死去的二弟。衆位意見怎樣？」末了他昻起頭來動問些懷疑着的大衆。</p>

<h3>一位女演員的自殺</h3>
<p>— 西林</p>
<p>因爲面貌酷似嘉寳</p>
<p>倣效而無獨立的性格，不一定在好萊塢，而是在無論什麽地方，都没有立足之地的。人家稱呼着你是中國的瑙瑪希拉，或是東方的勞萊哈台的時候，你且不要喜歡。我且告訴你一椿好萊塢最近的慘事｜｜一位女演員的自殺，因爲她的面貌，舉動，作風，一切都太貌似嘉寳了。這位女演員，呌薛格倫，蘇爾代蓀（Sigrun　solvason，她在一天晚上，穿上了她最喜歡的綢睡衣，手裏拿了一只香檳杯子，裏面倒了些毒藥，坐在鏡子前面和自己端詳了一回，就擎起杯子來，向着死神寒暄着，仰着　子將藥酒喝了下去。等到過了兩天之久，鄰居因爲很久看不見那位可愛的女郎，就去打她的門。不想打了半天，没有人答應，就覺得奇怪，而去報告了警察。後來將她的門打開了，進去一看，那位女主人已經死了。在别處搜得了她的遺書，裏面有一句話是：「一百萬人之中，祗有一個及格的。」這是她仰藥之後，臨死時的一種凄慘的哀嗚。</p>
<p>我再告訴你，薛格倫的死，是没有一些别的複雜原因的。她不受經濟的牽制，因爲她的富有的丈夫，是深愛她而儘量供給她財源的。她没有愛情的糾紛，因爲她是專心致志於電影，而無其他嗜好的。她死的惟一原因，就是因爲她太和瑞典明星葛雷泰嘉寳相像了，好萊塢都稱她爲嘉寳的替身。她學着嘉寳穿衣服，她學着嘉寳在銀幕上或是在私生活裏的體態，她並且還學習着嘉寳粗澀的聲音。她在路上走着，凡初到好萊塢的遊歷者，没有不當她是眞的嘉寳的。她有已經證明的表演的天才。但她却不能在好萊塢站住脚。因爲她有模倣嘉寳的狂熱，以致斷送了她自己的前程和生命。許多名導演們曾勸過她：「你還是自己爲大衆的認識而努力吧！不要去模倣嘉寳了。好萊塢祗能容留一個嘉寳，亦祗認識一個嘉寳。你若單獨自已顯出你的本色來，你的前程是無限制的。」但她却不能聽從，眞是可惜。</p>
<p>薛格倫的一生，和普通一般到好萊塢來試運氣的女子們，是不同的。她生在坎拿大的温尼撥格城。她雖是一個小家碧玉，却從小就以美麗出名。她長成之後，遇見了一位很有名的礦師，就嫁了他。那位礦師呌赫塞爾，他在舊金山設有公司，他們結婚的地點，就是舊金山。要是瑞典的女明星，久遠不到美國的話，她現在還是安安穩穩做着赫塞爾夫人哩。不幸瑞典的名導演史提爾帶了嘉寳來到美國，她的照片在美國各地報紙上披露着。於是薛格倫的一般朋友，都恭維着說那位瑞典女郎和她是一般無二的。薛格倫聽了，亦怦然心動了。她常自已說：「嘉寳是成功了。她所能做的，我亦能做。難道她能成功，我就不能成功嗎？」於是她就一心一念要到好萊塢去。</p>
<p>赫塞爾拗不過他夫人的意思，就答應了送她到好萊塢去。他並且爲帮助她一舉成名，特爲替她置辦了極富麗的行裝，替她在好萊塢租了一所時髦的住宅，替她開了一個銀行賬，這樣，這麽一位闊太太，就烈烈轟轟地，來到了全球影都的好萊塢。她開始不過做些臨時演員，可是一般導演們很器重她，尤其是西席地米爾，他派她在「羅宮春色，」以及最近的「克利歐柏德拉」等片中作着小角色。她丈夫的財源，是不斷地供給着，但是總私下禱祝着，她能一天醒悟過來，而不必在水銀燈下討生活。他並且爲確立她的地位起見，特爲爲她在好萊塢鄰近山中，買了一塊地，蓋起住宅房子來。後來她又覺得那個地方太遠，一個女人獨住着不方便，她的丈夫又替她另外在好萊塢時髦住宅區買了一所房子。這使她成了臨時演員中最闊綽的一個了。可惜他丈夫最後替她購買的時髦住宅，竟成了他愛妻畢命之所。</p>
<p>她不靠做演員，去維持她的生活，所以她亦不在乎公司的有工作没有工作派給她。可是她因和嘉寳太相像的緣故，她情願不計工資而得一個和嘉寳同等的角色。但是，和上面所說的一樣，好萊塢祗能容納一個嘉寳，亦祗能認識一個嘉寳，她的存在是多餘的，不需要的。多少晚上的不睡眠，在繡榻上展轉反側着，猛然地覺悟了，可惜太晚了，她自己以爲。於是她平素的高傲，逼她上了惟一之路。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「世家子弟」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Social　Register｜｜國泰</p>
<p>和五四時代的作品頗爲相似，這由於舞台劇改編的「世家子弟」，到底是落在時代的後面了。</p>
<p>原著者John　Emerson與Anita　Loos對於富人之羣的罪惡，在某種程度之下，他們是不遺餘力的攻擊的。在這裏他們反對少爺的母親之腐敗觀念，所謂少爺不能和低級的女人結合，在他們認爲是不合理的。於是乎他們寫那母親以萬元支票賄賂一怯弱的靑年，以拆散兒子的婚姻，更驕傲的以萬五千元的巨欵給兒子的情人，以爲有了錢便可以什麽都能做到的。在這一方面，無論如何是對富人們積極譏諷的。同時在另一方面，對於那天眞而放蕩不覊的女人，却給與了極大的同情。他們使她在紳士淑女們之間週旋，感覺着侷促不安，寫她不懂得高貴的人們之禮節，更寫她在地下的室内和僕人放肆的喝酒，甚至於醉後任情舞踏。從這些地方，無一不是表現她的天眞。而且她是十分富於同情心的，當她的友人，假裝肺病的時候，她甘願以鑽鐲給他質錢，甚至於日夜侍候他的疾病。這些地方，她是給觀衆同情的了。於是到最後她將萬元以上的支票撕得粉碎，大聲斥駡那太太的不道德。最後到底和少爺結婚了。而再一方面，對於平素揮金如士的少爺，却寫成一個好人，他爲了愛情，可以屈尊的和歌女結婚，而且他是眞正愛上了那一個歌女的。</p>
<p>如上所述，這一劇本無論如何是一種陳腐的作品，從採取題材以至於主題的决定，没有某一個地方是能够趕上時代的。但是前面說過，作者對於紳士淑女們的生活的確是諷刺的，譬如當宴會時請了四個高矮肥瘦不同的人在唱歌，所唱的全是「三個老鼠」之類的俚俗的歌曲，以及他們在大庭廣衆之中醜態畢露。但是這與其說是意識的暴露，無寗說是爲了使那對情人結合而不得不如此的可不是麽？當那少爺的母親給歌女怒斥一番之後，她不是慚愧得流涙麽？而同時少爺的父親却是一個好人，那個老頭子喬納也是一個正人君子。從這些地方觀察，我們不難對作者充分的明白，他們充其量不過是初期的資産階級的頭腦，一種對社會略有認識的怯弱的自由主義者罷了。</p>
<p>老實說，像這樣的作品，進步的電影編劇家决不會將它改編的。然而通常美國庸俗的編劇家，却最歡喜抓取這樣現存的故事。他們在戀愛至上主義的立塲上，這種東西是最能適合他們之胃口的。因此，我們覺得美國電影運動，在思想鬥爭上始終是凝固着似的，而相反的對於有利於布爾喬亞派的作品，却拚命的攝製。這樣說來，「世家子弟」仍然是對他們有利的東西。黄色的欺騙，使一窮女人得以高攀少爺結婚，還不够帮助現存制度之存在麽？</p>
<p>再說到表現的形式，那我們一點也不冤枉的說，從導演的手法以至於演員的演技，都不能趕上少數美國已經逹到了的技術的高度。很顯明的，劇中人的個性把握不住，而且在前面又使尋求娛樂的人們感覺沉悶。至於女主角的老大，要她扮裝一個少女，她是没有方法担當的了。柯靈摩爾（Coleen　Moore）在幾年前未常不是一個紅星，然而因着年華的消逝，她是不够滿足觀衆的了。</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>約翰從蒙尼卡的衣袋裏，掏出一張電報來。蒙尼卡道：「那電報是今天早上到的」。約翰打了開來，讀了一下，然後縐着眉頭說道：「怎麽啦？這到底是怎麽回事呀」？蒙尼卡看着她丈夫的臉說道：「我想到維也納去。」約翰不明白道：「維也納？」蒙尼卡眼望著面前白茫茫的一片湖水，慢慢地說道：「不錯的。我的那個嵌進式住宅房子的計劃，好像要行出去了。倘使行出去的話，我就是一個主動人。我要在維也納工作了一年之後，才能成功哩。」約翰似乎很生氣的道：「怎麽我事前一些都不知道？這才呌做靑天霹靂呢。」蒙尼卡斜睨著她丈夫問道：「你捨得我去嗎？」約翰道：「怎麽啦？或者我要跟你一同去的。」他點著香烟吸著，又說道：「但是，你爲什麽事前一些警告不給我呢？或者你要我陪你去的，是不是？」蒙尼卡還是帶著試探的口氣道：「你眞要去嗎？」約翰想了一想道：「再有六個星期，我的書就成功了。你還有多少時候呢？」蒙尼卡又仰著頭靠在約翰的身上說道：「我們不要講那件事吧。讓我們來看這太陽下山。」她說完子，又舉起手來。約翰看著她手腕上帶著，那天他買給她的那祗晶瑩的手錶。蒙尼卡問道：「你還記得你買它回來的那天晚上嗎？」約翰點點頭。蒙尼卡又說道：「那天晚上，你使我相信你是非常之愛我的。」約翰緊緊地摟著她，縐著眉說道：「我實在是深愛你的呀。那天晚上我要使你知道的就是你的地位，是没有别人可以代替的。」蒙尼卡帶著一種約翰所不明瞭的快樂，聲音顫抖著說道：「約翰！你眞的那樣想的嗎？」約翰道：「現在亦没有不那樣想呀。」蒙尼卡道；「約翰，你又來了。」約翰怪她道：「難道你不知道嗎？」蒙尼卡掉轉身來，將頭緊緊貼住了約翰的胸前，好像還貼得不够緊似的。太陽下山了，他們還是在湖水茫茫之中留連著。</p>
<p>蒙尼卡的眞意，或者約翰還猜不透，但是安娜在一下午，看著她急急忙忙地整理東西，就明白了一半。她設法將約翰從屋子裏調了出去，然後又呌侍女去替她煮茶。於是她走到蒙尼卡的面前，單刀直入的問道：「你告訴我，我已經疑心了半天了。是不是你要和約翰永遠分離了？」蒙尼卡遲疑了一下，然後吞吞吐吐地道：「唔，不錯。」安娜哼了一聲道：「眞好注意。我恐怕你到了維也納，會寫信告訴他的。」蒙尼卡說道：「信早已寫好了。」安娜道：「蒙尼卡，你又何妨聽聽他有什麽話說呢？」蒙尼卡道：「那有什麽用？我們不談它吧。」安娜堅執著道：「我的意思，爲約翰設想，你應當開誠公佈地和他說明白的好。」蒙尼卡聽了，歎了一口氣，一坐坐在床上，然後說道：「安娜，請你不要管好了。」這時約翰走到門口問道：「怎麽啦？什麽事呀？」安娜道：「没有什麽。不過神經有些不寗吧了。我去取水給她喝。」她就走到門口，低聲對約翰道：「你快進去寳貝寳貝她吧。「（未完）</p>

<h3>Confucius Worship Great Official Ye Chucang and Others Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi Attends the Yuan Meeting to Report</p>
<p>Wang Proposes Three Points on Venerating Confucius</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chucang, Chu Minyi, Fu Rulin and other three great officials of the Central Government to Qufu for the Confucius worship ceremony returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 28th. Chu immediately attended the Executive Yuan meeting to report on the Confucius worship ceremony. According to reports, after I reported the situation of the Confucius worship ceremony today, President Wang of the Executive Yuan proposed: (1) The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education should formulate methods for observing the Confucius worship ceremony. The methods for this Confucius worship ceremony were temporarily decided by the Central Government, and the descendants of Confucius still performed the kneeling ceremony, which was not uniform. (2) The Central Government has recently prescribed titles such as Grand Master, National Master, and Dharma Master for the Panchen Lama, so Kong Decheng, the 77th generation Yansheng Gong, will also be given a separate title to show respect, because the title of Yansheng Gong is still used from the Ming Dynasty. (3) Confucius's descendants are exempt from taxes on the fields, which have been granted for generations, totaling 100,000 mu. However, with the decline of the veneration of Confucius, the tenants mostly resisted rent, and what is even more ridiculous is that the tenants once invited Confucius's descendants to perform the play "Zi Jian Nanzi" to insult them. Therefore, President Wang also intends for the government to reorganize them to take care of their descendants. At the same time, because the Confucius Temple has been in disrepair for many years, the Ministry of Interior will formulate methods to repair the Confucius Temple so that the provincial and municipal governments can repair them separately. Also, because the musical instruments for the Confucius worship ceremony have not been used for a long time, and many musicians are scattered, the old musical instruments were all present for this Confucius worship ceremony, but they could not be used immediately. In the future, in order to preserve our country's ancient music, the Ministry of Interior will organize an ancient music research committee, gather several musicians from the former Confucius Temple in Beiping to teach and train so that it will not be lost. As for the musical instruments in the Taimiao Temple, after being transported to Nanjing from Beiping, they are now preserved by the Executive Yuan and can be used for various grand ceremonies in the future, in addition to finding ways to display them (Special dispatch on the 28th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chucang, the special envoy of the National Government to the Confucius worship ceremony, Chu Minyi, Fu Rulin, and the accompanying officials from the various Yuan and Ministries and representatives from various agencies took a special train from Yanzhou at 3:30 PM on the 27th, attached to the Pingpu through train and returned south. On the morning of the 28th, at 8 AM, they arrived at Pukou, transferred to the differential wheel to cross the river, and then entered the city and returned to various agencies to report everything (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th).</p>
<p>(Yanzhou) Confucius Decheng, the Confucius worship official, issued a written statement after the Confucius worship ceremony on the 27th, saying that for the birthday commemoration of the sage, the Central Government and the various Yuan and Ministries, and Chairman Han and the heads of the civil and education bureaus of this province, came from afar in the summer heat, and I am very honored. First of all, I would like to thank all the officials. The way of the sage has been popular for more than 2,000 years and is known to people in various countries at home and abroad. I dare not exaggerate. Since the Republic of China, there have been internal and external troubles, and the military has been in a hurry, so there was really no time for the ceremony to commemorate the sage. However, Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People cited many of the sage's last words. Sun Yat-sen respected the sage. Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement focused on the old morality. Chiang Kai-shek also advocated respecting the sage. Chairman Han of this province has repeatedly advocated repairing the temple and also advocates respecting the sage. I hope that after this commemoration, the people of the country will vigorously promote the purpose of learning from teachers and valuing the Tao. It must be known that worshiping the holy Tao is supporting the government. In the future, internal and external troubles will naturally be reduced, and domestic politics will not be difficult to improve (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 27th).</p>
<h3>Celebrations for Confucius's Birthday Held by All Sectors in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 27th, all sectors in Guihua and Suiyuan held a celebration meeting for Confucius's birthday at the Junmin Lianhuan Society in Xiaojiaochang at 10 AM. Prior to this, the provincial government ordered the whole province to take a holiday on that day and hang flags to celebrate. More than 900 representatives from various agencies and organizations participated. The ceremony was very grand. Fu Zuoyi presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the Confucius worship ceremony, saying that Confucius's morality can dominate China's culture for thousands of years. When the way of Confucius flourishes, the country must prosper, otherwise it will decline and fall into chaos. Our veneration of Confucius can revive the nation and promote Datong. Then Ji Shouguang, the supervisor of the provincial supervision committee, spoke about the relationship between Confucius's academics and Sun Yat-sen's ideology. Finally, Yuan Qingzeng, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Wen Tingxiang, the director of the Provincial Farmers' Association, gave speeches successively. After the speeches, the meeting adjourned. At the same time, the Provincial Party Headquarters also held a commemoration, attended by more than 70 members of the executive and supervisory committees and staff. Qiao Binghua presided over the meeting and reported on Confucius's biography and the significance of the commemoration. Then Pan Xiuren spoke about Confucius's doctrine and political thought, elaborating on them (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 27th).</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<p>People and Jobs - Instruction</p>
<p>In this day and age, when "economic recession" is a common refrain, countless helpless people are struggling on the brink of starvation. With few jobs available and many seeking them, finding a place to earn a living is as difficult as ascending to heaven. The phenomenon of "too many people for too few jobs" has permeated the lower and middle classes of society, becoming a deeply ingrained ailment of the times. However, from the lower and middle classes of society, rising to the highest echelons, there is the strange situation of "too many jobs for too few people." Generally, the higher the social class, the more apparent the problems become. Those who feel injustice ask, "We are all human beings. Why are some unemployed, forced to retire, and left to die, while others have easy, lucrative positions and cannot handle them all? If it's about differences in talent, why do those from humble backgrounds always fail while the wealthy thrive, and the obese and dim-witted become high officials?" Frankly speaking, these complaints are not without merit. We deeply feel that in these chaotic times, there are thousands of holes and problems waiting to be addressed. However, due to the constraints of reality, we must prioritize and differentiate between urgency and importance. Today, the two major abnormal phenomena of "too many people for too few jobs" and "too many jobs for too few people" are both undesirable extremes. However, if we seek to correct them, the latter should be prioritized over the former. Firstly, the problem of "too many people for too few jobs" is too vast and cannot be easily solved entirely. Secondly, the problem of "too many jobs for too few people" is most apparent in the upper classes, and any inappropriate actions by the upper classes will inevitably cause far greater harm than those of the lower and middle classes. This can be stated definitively. Thirdly, the upper classes should lead by example in all reforms to set a good example and correct the public's perception. However, we often see prominent figures in today's world holding multiple important positions, their lives consumed by stereotypical meetings, assemblies, social gatherings, and constant movement. Moreover, their leisure time requirements may even exceed those of ordinary people. A day has limited hours, and a person has limited energy. It is inevitable that they cannot attend to everything. Because they cannot be everywhere at once, they often delegate some of their nominally required duties to their trusted associates. These associates, acting in their name and relying on special connections, often engage in underhanded dealings, pursuing personal gain and committing evil deeds. In the most extreme cases, they further delegate to their own trusted associates. Layer upon layer of pretense causes suffering to the common people, and it is unknown who truly holds power and who bears real responsibility. Those harmed are undoubtedly wronged, and those slandered</p>
<h3>Austrian Incident: Germany Pulls the Strings</h3>
<p>Austrian Chancellor Discovers Conclusive Evidence</p>
<p>Set to Take Formal Action with Britain, France, and Italy</p>
<p>Vienna, Today - According to official sources, Chancellor Schuschnigg has discovered crucial documents proving that the July 25th incident was indeed orchestrated by Germany through officials of the Austrian National Socialist Party, including Habicht and others. The documents were initially provided by detained National Socialist Party members after the failed rebellion and have since been confirmed from various sources. Chancellor Schuschnigg is preparing to take formal action. The documents specify that German individuals at the Munich headquarters issued instructions to Austrian National Socialist Party members, with Hitler fully aware. Chancellor Schuschnigg is reportedly presenting this evidence to Britain, France, and Italy, requesting them to decide whether the matter should be submitted to the League of Nations for arbitration or directly negotiated with Germany. Additionally, the Austrian Chancellor plans to seek another international bond from the League of Nations to cover the significant costs incurred in suppressing the incident.

<h3>Triumvirate Government Organized under Hitler's Guidance</h3>
<p>Göring to Serve as Deputy Prime Minister</p>
<p>Blomberg in Charge of National Defense</p>
<p>Hess Responsible for Party Affairs</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources, General Göring, General Blomberg, and General Hess will form a triumvirate government to manage state affairs under Hitler's guidance. It is anticipated that Hitler will announce these appointments at the National Socialist Party Congress in Nuremberg next week. General Göring will reportedly serve as Deputy Prime Minister, managing German political affairs. General Blomberg will manage national defense affairs, with the final say on matters of war and peace. General Hess will be solely responsible for party affairs. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>National Socialist Party Congress to Have Two Important Declarations</h3>
<p>Hitler's Policies Turning More Moderate</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party is scheduled to hold its full party congress in Nuremberg starting on September 4th. It is anticipated that German leader Hitler will make two important announcements during the congress. One is a detailed plan to defeat opponents of National Socialism, which is likely to be moderate in nature and will involve the Catholic Church issue. This is because approximately half of those who voted against in the August 19th referendum were Catholics. Hitler alluded to this in his August 20th speech, stating that the National Socialist Party will use swift and thorough methods to bring the final 10% of Germans into alignment with National Socialism. The other important announcement is believed to be a large-scale amnesty. Former Congressman Neubauer and former Magdeburg Mayor Leuter will be released after the new amnesty decree is issued. Neubauer testified in the Reichstag fire trial, engaging in a two-hour verbal battle with the interrogator, supporting the Communist Party. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Speech: Italy as a Nation of Warriors</h3>
<p>A Nation's Prestige Depends on Its Naval, Land, and Air Forces</p>
<p>Rome - Italian newspapers today published the full text of Prime Minister Mussolini's speech at the conclusion of the Italian Army's grand maneuvers. After outlining the effects of the maneuvers, Mussolini praised the high moral standards of both the military and the people, as well as their dedication to service, in the name of the Italian King. A portion of Mussolini's speech is as follows: "No country in Europe today desires war, and Italy especially does not wish to hear of war. Italy has repeatedly issued active and official proofs of this. However, war is not impossible and crises can arise at any time, anywhere. In a distant land, war has been ongoing for a long time. Even in Europe, in late July, a situation similar to that of 1914 arose. I can state today that if we had not taken preventive measures and deployed troops to the northern border, the dangers ahead would have been unpredictable. Italy will gradually become a militaristic nation, and I also intend to train Italy into a nation of warriors, with a people possessing the virtue of obedience and a spirit of sacrifice to serve the nation. This is the lifeblood of our nation. Whether in politics, economics, or religion, we must have the military mindset of being loyal to the nation. War has always been the duty of the people. If the people can follow the inherent and historical forces, then no matter what conferences, treaties, or strange claims are made, war will ultimately not be abolished, as it is based on the origins of human history and will exist for all eternity." Mussolini then discussed the fundamental transformation of Italy's national spirit, stating, "I want to solemnly declare to you again that force is an indispensable element in all countries and at all levels. Today, nations have not yet invented anything that can replace force. Force is the most obvious and concrete manifestation of a nation's overall strength. A nation's prestige depends entirely on its naval, land, and air forces. When you return to your barracks or homes in the future, you should vividly remember the exercises of today, as they are a representation of the nation's healthy strength. I know that you are all proud to have fulfilled your duties." (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>French Naval Program</h3>
<p>Adding Battleships</p>
<p>Improving Aviation Facilities</p>
<p>(Paris) French Naval Minister Piétri told a guest today, "I am determined to support a large navy. The top priority in my shipbuilding program is to build a sister ship to the Dunkerque-class battleship. The Dunkerque will be completed in 1937, and her sister ship in 1938. I have ordered the complete renovation of three Provence-class battleships. The first will be completed within a few months." Piétri has also submitted a four-year plan to improve naval aviation, including the construction of underground oil depots. One is already being built in Agadir. He also plans to install new-style land artillery batteries along the coasts of Algeria and Morocco. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Royalists Dissatisfied with Current Government</h3>
<p>Hungarian royalist legitimists held a meeting in Donatamas. Congressman Baraivi Vesini delivered a speech strongly criticizing the current government's foreign policy, stating, "Prime Minister General Gömbös was originally a staff officer and is easily attracted to German militarism. His adopted policies are dominated by this mentality. Foreign Minister Kánya is also reluctant to part with National Socialism. They seem to have forgotten that National Socialist barbarism is rejected by all of Europe. In short, Gömbös and Kánya have isolated Hungary and brought our greatest enemy, Benes, closer to Mussolini. If this policy is not changed, we will inevitably lose the friendship of Italy and Austria, and these two countries will no longer be able to trust the current government." (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>or unknowingly slander.</p>
<p>Therefore, we dare to sincerely advise the prominent figures of this era. The nation faces many challenges and relies on capable individuals. Accomplishing anything is not easy and requires dedication. From now on, why not thoroughly consider how many responsibilities you can truly fulfill with your energy? If you cannot handle everything yourself, then you should broaden the avenues for talented individuals and eliminate the past habits of condoning trusted associates who deceive and commit evil deeds. If those in positions of authority have this demeanor, perhaps they will not feel the sense of "too many jobs for too few people," and others may reduce their lament of "too many people for too few jobs."</p>
<h3>Moscow Reports Japan Intends to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Notorious Anti-Russian Figures Arrive in Harbin</p>
<p>To Incite Puppets to Take the Second Step</p>
<p>Arrested Russian Employees Subjected to Torture and Forced Confessions</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to reports disclosed by local newspapers, three Japanese individuals, including the well-known Sato, have arrived in Harbin. They serve as Japanese representatives of the Manchurian Transportation Department and are known for arresting Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway and attempting to seize the railway's management rights a year ago. The Harbin Japanese newspaper "Furimaiya" stated, "Since their arrival, they will hold an important meeting with Manchurian representatives of the Chinese Eastern Railway to discuss a more advanced program. The Soviet side will be required to respond to why they transported the railway's locomotives and vehicles into Soviet territory, and to respond to the current amendments to the scope of authority of the railway's director-general. The Manchurian side should obtain equal rights and adopt the "Kopek" instead of the gold ruble as the basis for calculation." (TASS Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Blagoveshchensk) According to reports received here, the total number of Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway arrested since August 13th has reached 54. The arrests were initially carried out by Manchurian and White Russian police, and later by open Japanese military police. The families of the arrested Russian employees are greatly concerned because they have heard that the arrested personnel have been subjected to inhumane and unreasonable abuse in the police stations. Most of them have been flogged, but more sophisticated punishments have also been used. The purpose of using this coercive method is to force the arrested to falsely admit that they have implemented various acts of sabotage and terrorism on the Chinese Eastern Railway. The arrested personnel who have been flogged are forced to sign documents stating that they "admit" that they were ordered by the Red Army's Far Eastern Special Detachment to contact local bandits and organize acts of sabotage against railway tracks and stations. (TASS Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Local newspapers cite various reports directly related to the anti-Soviet activities of Manchurian Japanese newspapers. These newspapers continue to publish vague rumors claiming that Soviet citizens and communists in Manchuria are planning "conspiracies" and "bloody punishments," with the aim of justifying the repeated unreasonable arrests of Soviet railway employees. The Harbin Japanese newspaper "Furimaiya" claims that there are large armories in the residences of Soviet railway employees. However, this information reveals that Japanese and Manchurian police are deliberately creating false accusations. Searches of Soviet people's residences are mostly conducted "when they are not present." The newspaper, directed by the Japanese military, advocates for the continued arrest of Russian employees, including senior executives of the railway. The Harbin Nichinichi Shimbun reported that the highest officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway will also be arrested. "The wave of arrests will also sweep from the eastern section of the railway to Harbin, and a large number of arrests will occur here." The Harbin Sipeng (transliteration) newspaper claimed, "All Soviet people must be expelled from Manchuria, and the Chinese Eastern Railway must be handed over to the "Manchukuo" Railway Department." The Dalian Japanese newspaper also publicly stated, "Since the breakdown of the Chinese Eastern Railway conference, the Manchurian side must use all methods within its power to put the Chinese Eastern Railway in a difficult situation. Then the Soviet side will be forced to abandon the railway." (TASS Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Sends Overtures to France</h3>
<p>Friendship in Hirota's Words</p>
<p>(Paris) A reporter from "Écho de Paris" previously investigated the truth of Japanese nationalism in Japan. During his stay, he met with Foreign Minister Hirota, who gave the reporter a statement, which was recently published by the newspaper. Hirota's statement said, "The political relations between Japan and France have always been friendly. During the European War, the armies of the two countries fought shoulder to shoulder. Later, the two countries were signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty. We are also working together to maintain peace in the Pacific. France has vast colonies and many interests in Asia, but France has never clashed with Japan's interests, and it will never clash because there is no real point of contention between the two countries." After announcing this statement, the newspaper's reporter added a few words, saying, "As for international issues, it is useless to ask Hirota, because Foreign Minister Hirota is both a thorough diplomat and a thorough Japanese. His taciturn attitude contains infinite meaning. After investigating Japanese nationalism, we have reached a variety of worrying conclusions, and the Foreign Minister's silence is one of them."

<h3>The Evolution of the American Monroe Doctrine</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires - Howard, chairman of Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance and the Associated Press, today advocated the abolition of the Monroe Doctrine. Howard is one of the most influential journalists in the United States and has always been an authority on world affairs. He gave a speech to about 300 Argentine dignitaries and foreigners at the American Chamber of Commerce here today, praising President Roosevelt's foreign policy. Howard expressed great satisfaction with the fact that the US government's "Good Neighbor" policy has achieved practical results in a very short period of time, such as the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and Nicaragua. He believes that one thing has not yet been implemented, which is the abolition of the Monroe Doctrine. The initial intention of the doctrine was good, because its purpose was to increase mutual understanding between the countries of North and South America, but in fact, it has had the opposite effect and has become an obstacle. It is noted that Howard arrived in the capital of Argentina on the first trial flight of the flying boat Brazil. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) High-ranking government officials stated regarding the speech by the famous American publisher Howard in the capital of Argentina advocating the abolition of the Monroe Doctrine that, under President Roosevelt's foreign policy, the Monroe Doctrine has been restored to its original meaning.

Its only effect is to declare opposition to non-American countries interfering in American affairs. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's principled attitude towards the disarmament conference can be generally observed as follows: (1) The fundamental policy of the naval disarmament proposal is to propose to guide the nations by using the existing strength of the nations as a benchmark, not only restricting the substantive disarmament and abolition of armaments. (2) Regarding the policy for the preparatory conference (3) Regarding the policy for the notice of abrogation of the Washington Treaty, the Washington Treaty can be notified for abrogation at the end of December of this year. This is a right under the treaty. The Japanese government will not hesitate to exercise this right, but the specific decision on the timing of the notice will be left to the discretion of Foreign Minister Hirota without delay.

<h3>Japan-Netherlands Talks Reopen</h3>
<p>The Bottleneck Lies in Maritime Transport Issues</p>
<p>Batavia - At 11:00 AM today, the two Japanese representatives, Nagaoka and Koshida, met with the Dutch East Indies representative, Lanner of Tuft, at the Art Association to begin discussing the issue of restricting the import of ceramics and maritime transport issues. Today, the Japanese side requested to suspend the implementation of the order restricting the import of ceramics and requested that no new restrictions be implemented during the meeting. The Dutch East Indies side has slightly understood this point, so it is not difficult to resolve. However, regarding maritime transport issues, the Dutch East Indies side hopes to resolve it at the same time as the ceramics issue, while the Japanese side hopes to entrust it to private discussions and the government will supervise it from the side. The opinions of both parties have not yet been consistent on this point. (Dentsu Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Australian Commercial Discord</h3>
<p>Melbourne - Although Lancashire, England, has raised serious protests against Australia's newly promulgated cotton goods import tariff, according to official sources today, the Australian government has decided to proceed with the previous agreement. Changes to the legislative bill can only be made by the parliament. However, if there are difficulties, the government may consider flexible solutions, provided that the cotton goods are imported before November 11 and are limited to those for domestic sales. Lancashire's protest is based on the claim that Australia's new tariff rate violates the Ottawa Agreement. The British Department of Commerce recently held a meeting to discuss the matter. Representatives from the Lancashire cotton industry attended and stated that Australia is only responsible for protecting Australian industries that have a proper prospect of success under the Ottawa Agreement. Now, Australian industries that require a tax of 100% cannot be considered to be in accordance with the provisions of the Ottawa Agreement. As for Australia's claim that the tax increase only involves 197,000 pounds of the total of 5.7 million pounds, it must be known that what is being contested now is a matter of principle, not a matter of numbers.

<h3>International Currency War</h3>
<p>The Exchange Rate Between the Pound Sterling and the French Franc Gradually Stabilizing</p>
<p>The Resistance of Gold Standard Countries Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>(Paris) According to predictions from French financial circles today, the exchange rates between the US dollar and the British pound against the French franc will be temporarily fixed. It is estimated that the US dollar will be set at 12.5 francs, and the British pound at 70 francs. Financial authorities believe that the recent repatriation of large sums of money from London by continental European countries is due to this relationship. A Paris newspaper estimated today that the British Exchange Equalisation Account has used 50 million pounds since June to maintain the gold pound exchange rate. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) The US dollar is stronger today because rumors of inflation have gradually disappeared. It is likely that the strength will continue. The Treasury Department is prepared for large government expenditures. The mark fell 23 points today because the president of the German Reichsbank, Herr Schacht, refused to pay interest on Dawes and Young bonds. (27th National Telegram)</p>

<p>At a meeting of the National Bank of Belgium in Brussels today, the bank's governor, Mr. Francqui, stated that gold standard countries around the world should increase their economic solidarity, but he believes that everything depends on France's attitude. (27th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the exchange rate between the British and French currencies was 75.75, and the exchange rate between the US and French currencies was 14.98, both of which were stable. However, people in Paris are convinced that British authorities are now anticipating a further devaluation of the US dollar and are planning to cope with it. If so, the US dollar will depreciate, and the British pound will also depreciate accordingly. Some quarters say that the time is not yet ripe to fix the British pound's price at 70 francs. Therefore, there is no certainty about the future price of the so-called Anglo-Saxon currency. For this reason, people are paying attention to how gold standard countries will resist the pull of the British pound and the US dollar. Key French experts believe that the French and Swiss francs have ample gold reserves to protect them, and Belgium's position is also relatively stable. However, the currencies of the Netherlands and Italy seem more vulnerable to attack in comparison. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Canada Establishes Silver Exchange</h3>
<p>The intention of establishing a silver exchange in Montreal, Canada, is to create a market for spot and forward trading of silver. The Quebec provincial government has approved it, and it will start operations as soon as internal organizational procedures are completed.

<h3>Germany Controls Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is now pursuing its new policy of only buying what it can pay for. Once existing contracts expire, the foreign currency released by the Deutsche Bank will be limited to the amount of foreign currency imported. This control will be even stricter. In mid-September, the amount of foreign currency allocated for imported goods is still 5% of the average demand from 1930 to 1931. The allocated foreign currency is for settling contracts signed before June 1 and rubber purchased before July 1. The speech given by Dr. Schacht, president of the Deutsche Bank, on August 26 has relatively stabilized various prices on the Berlin Stock Exchange. The rise in various stocks seems to increase the production of raw material substitutes. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>US Afforestation to Prevent Drought</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of Agriculture Wallace recently announced that forests will be planted in an area 1,000 miles long and 200 miles wide from Canada to Texas to prevent the severe drought suffered by the western United States. Wallace said that the cost of afforestation is approximately US$75,000,000, but only US$10,000,000 will be allocated when construction begins. President Roosevelt has allocated US$15 million for the experiment. The forest area covers approximately 20 million acres. According to afforestation expert Mr. Zelkox, the scale of this afforestation plan is unprecedented in the United States, and its purpose is to improve the climate and other agricultural conditions so that areas frequently affected by wind and drought will no longer be harmed.

<p>(London) The capital of England is densely populated with heavy traffic, and the sound of horns is incessant, making it difficult for ordinary residents to sleep peacefully, which is very distressing. Recently, various groups in the capital have been keenly aware of this and have been vigorously promoting the ban on noise. The Ministry of Transport is also supporting this campaign, which has now taken effect. The municipal authorities have designated a "quiet zone" around Charing Cross.

<p>(Washington) American cotton textile workers are still threatening to strike en masse. Today, the strike committee of the United Textile Workers of America is discussing plans for wool and rayon workers to strike. According to Committee Chairman Gorman, wool and rayon textile workers will likely strike at the same time as cotton workers. Although September 1 is planned as the start date for the strike, the exact date for the cotton strike is still undecided. It will likely begin sometime this week, but it may not be fully realized until September 4. The hope that President Roosevelt will be able to obtain a final solution still exists. The demands of the United Textile Workers of America are: (1) increased wages, (2) limited working hours, (3) abolition of discrimination against union members, and (4) workers' right to assemble and negotiate. Employers have not agreed to the above demands, so workers are taking steps to strike en masse, involving 825,000 workers. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>US New Treasury Bonds Oversubscribed</h3>
<p>New Bonds to Be Issued</p>

It is rumored that the Treasury Department is now planning to issue Treasury bills to pay off the bonds maturing on September 15. After that, new bonds will be issued to replace the bonds maturing on October 15. The bond market has been strong recently, and it is expected that the government's new bonds will be welcomed.

<h3>Many Americans Also Smoke Opium</h3>
<p>Quantity Shipped From the Orient Increases</p>
<p>(Washington) The Federal Narcotics Control Board today released its annual report, stating that the amount of opium shipped from China and Persia to the United States increased in 1933, so it is feared that the habit of opium smoking in the United States, which has greatly decreased in recent years, will rebound. The report is prepared to be submitted to the signatory countries of the International Opium Convention. The report stated that the amount of other narcotics shipped from European countries to the United States is the same as before, mostly morphine and heroin, and the most from Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Turkey. According to the statistics in the report, the consumption of narcotics by Americans is roughly the same as that of other countries. Although the laws are strict, and the number of opium confiscations last year doubled compared to the previous year, the price of opium has not changed, indicating that the demand has increased and the supply is continuously available, which surprised the administration. The number of opium confiscations has broken historical records, with the most in Honolulu, the Philippines, and the Pacific coast. Morphine shipped from Japan via Honolulu and from China via the Philippines is also frequently confiscated. The report does not have separate statistics for the territories, because all laws are universally implemented. (27th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Sino-German Joint Construction of the Yushan-Nanchang Railway</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) According to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, the news report about the signing of a contract for the Sino-French joint construction of the Yushan-Nanchang Railway refers to the German factory undertaking the manufacture of rails and other materials. The so-called cooperation with the Bank of China refers to the fact that the material cost is not paid in cash, but is guaranteed by the Bank of China to be repaid on a conditional basis. The 24 million Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway bonds were originally borrowed from Shanghai banks for 16 million, of which 8 million was paid directly in cash, and the other 8 million refers to this material cost, which the Bank of China contacted the German steel mill to undertake and guaranteed regular payments.

<h3>Zhejiang Province Coordinates Food Supply</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Provincial Government believes that the drought has spread to various counties, but the harvests in Wenzhou and Taizhou are still abundant.

<h3>Gesang Zeren Arrives in Xi'an</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Gesang Zeren, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, departed from Tongguan on the 26th and arrived in the province at 7:00 PM. He said that his main task was to investigate the social customs, habits, religious, and ethnic conditions of Qinghai. As for Xikang, Huang Musong had already inspected it once, and it has not been decided whether to inspect it again in the future. The meaning of the inspection is not for any specific purpose. The Commission's organizational charter originally stipulated sending personnel to the border regions for investigation. Rumors that he was here to negotiate certain affairs are not true. In a personal capacity, he may assist in handling a few matters, but he has not been commissioned by the government or any other party. As for the Panchen Lama, he will first reside in Qinghai after completing his scripture presentation in Mongolia, and will return to Tibet next spring after the snow melts. The duration of the inspection is estimated to be four months, but may be extended or shortened depending on the actual needs. It has not yet been determined whether they will return to Beijing via Xikang or along the same route after the investigation is completed. They will stay in Xi'an for several days until all the accompanying personnel arrive and all the procedures are completed before they can depart west. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

When Yu was a general in Sanyuan in the past, he often visited various schools in his spare time and felt that the teaching of dynamics, physics, and chemistry in the schools only involved lecturing from books, without any scientific equipment for experimentation. He had long intended to find a way to solve this difficult problem for the schools. Now, he plans to establish a central scientific experiment laboratory to fulfill his ten-year-old wish.

<h3>He Jian's Report After Returning from Nanyue</h3>
<p>The General Situation of the Communist Bandits Fleeing into Hunan</p>
<p>County Reports of Disasters and Prayers for Rain</p>
<p>Changsha News: He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, went to Nanyue again in the middle of this month, partly to discuss the three-year plan for Hunan Province, and partly to deal with the bandit police incidents on the border of Jiangxi. He returned to the province on the afternoon of the 19th, and the 20th happened to be the expanded commemoration week. He immediately attended the meeting and reported on various important matters. The records are as follows:</p>
<p>He's report said, "The Western Route Army is making progress in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi. Only the Xiao Ke bandits remain. Because their nests in Jiangxi have been completely lost, they cannot survive and have no choice but to flee to survive. As soon as the Western Route Army heard that the Xiao bandits had fled, they immediately dispatched teams to various counties to block them, and at the same time transferred troops to follow and suppress them. The bandits who fled into Hunan numbered about five or six thousand, with about three thousand guns. They specialized in taking remote paths and copied into the territory of Hunan, where local hiding places, symbols and flags, falsely claimed that the Hunan army was returning to defend. It was not until Rucheng Guidong that the team guarding the bunker noticed and knew that it was indeed the Xiao bandits who had fled into Hunan. The regiment was urgently transferred to block and pursue. The bandits' plan was to leave Hunan Province via Sichuan and Guizhou, and use extremely swift and erratic actions to take advantage of the weakness and flee without contacting the National Army. Fortunately, the bandits' plan has been clarified, and there is a certain direction to pursue. Now teams are being sent to strictly pursue and suppress them. As long as they meet our regiment and make contact, delaying the bandits' itinerary by one or two days, then our troops can catch up and easily eliminate the Xiao bandits in Hunan. This is the recent escape of the Xiao bandits and the general situation of the National Army's pursuit.</p>
<p>Regarding the reports of disasters in various counties, I mentioned in my talk last Tuesday that the documents and telegrams from various counties reporting disasters and requesting urgent relief are still pouring in. I mentioned in my last talk that it is the responsibility of the county magistrate and various public legal groups to apply for urgent relief because they do not know what is going on and intend to divide the relief funds. The villagers gathering together to sit and eat row meals is the responsibility of the local ruffians who are taking advantage of the situation and fishing in troubled waters. Moreover, drought is not as temporary and helpless as a flood. Even if some places have withered seedlings, because the time has not come, it is not yet time to eat new grains. Before the period of scarcity, why should we issue urgent relief, why should we sit and eat row meals? This year, some places in Hunan Province have indeed suffered from drought, but judging from the current famine situation, there are still relief methods, because the disaster-stricken counties can replant miscellaneous grains, and the counties near the lake have had a relatively good harvest. As long as everyone does not follow the officials and gentry who intend to divide the relief funds and the local ruffians who take advantage of the situation to cause a famine, I believe that there will be no famine. There are only 75 counties in Hunan Province, and more than 60 counties have reported disasters and requested relief. Many of them are fabricated and untrue, which has affected the truly disaster-stricken counties. In particular, the officials and gentry of various counties only know how to send documents and telegrams, report disasters and request relief, but no one has mentioned remedial measures, which shows the negligence of the officials and gentry of various counties in human affairs. Now, regarding the drought, the provincial government and the provincial disaster relief committee have reported to the central government for relief, and there will be a whole relief in the future. However, the officials and gentry of various counties must pay attention to remedial measures in the future, and do not fabricate disaster reports. Speaking of praying for rain, it is not impossible to do, but I have said that it is to focus on internal reform and to inspire harmony between heaven and earth, and to follow the "true meaning of abstinence" of fasting and bathing, and do not waste. Two days ago, I heard that the citizens of Changsha respectfully sent Tao and Li Erzhen back to the palace, which was extremely enthusiastic, but inevitably overdone. If Tao and Li Er Gong were conscious, seeing the citizens waste too much, they would definitely feel uneasy. In addition, according to reports, some street groups are extorting money from gods, so the people's minds are even more indescribable. In short, if you want to inspire auspiciousness and harmony, you must first strive for the goodness of human affairs, which can be said to be the combination of human beings and heaven, and then can heaven and man be one. In Hunan, when it comes to human affairs, the situation is extremely complicated, especially since the Chu people have many rumors and like to make trouble out of nothing. For example, the recent reports in the newspapers that Zhang Muxian, the Director of the Finance Department of the Fourth Route Headquarters, and Zhang Kailian, the Director of the Finance Department, resigned, and someone succeeded them, and that someone else resigned, etc., vividly described, like something really happened. Not only did I not know about it, but the rumor may have been inexplicable to the two directors, Zhang and Zhang. This is an example of the imperfection of human affairs. In short, if we only know how to respect gods and pray for blessings, but cannot do our best to seek the unity of heaven and man, we still cannot inspire auspiciousness and harmony. It is also necessary to have a good heart and good deeds. For example, respecting gods and praying for rain is originally a good heart. If we only know how to respect gods and give up all human affairs, or build altars and pray for excessive extravagance because of praying for rain, it is all a good heart but not good deeds. We must know that although disasters are sent by heaven, they are indeed made by man. If we can follow the two principles of "doing our best to combine with heaven" and "having a good heart and good deeds" and work hard, we will definitely be able to inspire auspiciousness and harmony and reduce disasters.

<h3>Nanchang Welcomes Kong Hechong</h3>
<p>Kong Delivers Speech Offering Suggestions on Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Embracing a Spirit of Sacrifice to Revive China</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Yesterday afternoon at six o'clock, four organizations, including the Jiangxi Provincial Capital's People's Anti-Bandit Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Provincial Federation of Commerce, held a banquet at the Provincial Party Headquarters auditorium to welcome Kong Hechong, a consultant of the Military Affairs Commission. Director He, Director Yan, and Group Leader Wang from the Military Affairs Commission were invited to accompany him. Consultant Kong and his adjutant, Zhu Rongsheng, arrived, and Group Leader Wang and Director Yan from the Military Affairs Commission also attended. All members of the four organizations were present. They first took a group photo and then took their seats. Ouyang Wu, a member of the Anti-Bandit Association, Zeng Zhanggui, a member of the Provincial Federation of Commerce, Xu Ruifu, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Xu Zheren, a member of the Federation of Trade Unions, successively delivered welcome speeches. Then, Kong reported on three points, followed by speeches from Hu Mintang, Zhang Jijou, and others. The event concluded at eight o'clock with everyone in high spirits. The following is a record of Kong's speech:</p>
<p>Kong's speech: "Today, I am truly undeserving of the warm welcome from fellow compatriots. However, from today onwards, I will, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, strive with the utmost determination and courage to revive the Republic of China and to suppress bandits in order to solve the suffering of the masses. Therefore, I can only boldly accept the grand welcome from my fellow compatriots today. Now, I will divide what I want to say today into three points: (1) the reasons for the total collapse of the Red bandits; (2) my suggestions for bandit suppression; and (3) how to respond to the welcome from my fellow compatriots. I will elaborate on each point below. (1) The reason for the total collapse of the Communist bandits is that communism cannot be implemented in China because China has no capitalists, only the very poor and the slightly poor. There is simply no basis for class struggle. Therefore, communism is simply not viable in China. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the total collapse of the Communist bandits. Secondly, the smoke screen used by the Communist Party to deceive the masses has been completely exposed. The Communist Party's appeal is to workers and farmers, and their method is land redistribution and communalization. But what is the actual situation? In the bandit areas, workers have to eat their own food and work for the public for four days a week. Workers only suffer and enjoy no benefits. As for farmers, although they initially benefited from land redistribution, they are now suffering beyond description. According to this year's situation, each person can receive an average of five piculs of rent grain, but the pseudo-Soviet government has already borrowed rent three times, one basket each time, totaling one dan for two times. There is also a frugality campaign, with each person borrowing one basket of rent. Various taxes and levies also require one basket. In addition, there are other forms of exploitation. The five piculs of rent grain each person receives are almost all taken away by the pseudo-government, and each person has to perform public service for four days a week. Farmers not only have no benefits but suffer increasingly. Workers and farmers now know the deceitful policies of the Red bandits, and people's hearts are wavering. This is the second point for the total collapse of the Communist bandits. Furthermore, the national army's blockade policy has intensified, and the supply of food, oil, salt, and military supplies in the bandit areas is dwindling daily. The masses in the bandit areas are unable to enjoy material benefits and are universally dissatisfied with the Soviet government, constantly escaping and surrendering to the national army. This is the third point for the total collapse of the Communist bandits. (2) Regarding suggestions for bandit suppression, the responsibility for bandit suppression should be borne by every compatriot. Not only should everyone understand the methods of eliminating bandits, but they should also further prevent the occurrence of bandits in the future. One must know that the reason for the emergence of bandits is that the bandits have grasped the weaknesses of the masses. What are the weaknesses of the masses? It lies in the backwardness of cultural and educational levels, the inability to distinguish between good and bad bandits, so the bandits can carry out their instigation work. In addition, the failure to immediately eliminate the bandits when they first emerged is also one of the reasons. Now, the way to eliminate the bandits lies in the political organization of the masses and raising the educational level of the people so that the people can expose the bandits' anaesthetic and deceptive methods and not blindly follow them. This kind of ideological reform is the fundamental way to eliminate bandits. Attention should also be paid to propaganda. For example, before I surrendered, I heard that all those who surrendered to the national army were killed, causing many who wanted to surrender to hesitate. Now that I have arrived here, I understand that it was all the propaganda of the Red bandits. The national army is magnanimous and not only does not kill those who surrender but also treats prisoners of war very well. In the future, if we can eliminate this kind of propaganda work by the Communist bandits, we will have done an important work in bandit suppression. Secondly, we must understand that the power of the bandits is the masses. If the bandits have no masses, they have no power at all. Therefore, our work to win over the masses is also an important issue. If the work is done well and the masses are separated from the bandits, then the bandits will be eliminated naturally. The above are the political strategies for bandit suppression. Regarding the military aspect, I am wholeheartedly in agreement with Chairman Chiang's policy. As long as we use a steady and sure method, it will be the Red bandits' fatal blow. Everyone here must support Chairman Chiang in the future and do things step by step. In addition, the bandits are afraid of airplanes, blockades, and our fortress policy. The fortress policy, in particular, should be especially strict, so that the bandits cannot escape, and the bandit suppression work can be completely cleared at once. The above points are a general introduction to everyone. I will write out the detailed methods in a booklet for reference in bandit suppression. (3) How to respond to everyone's welcome. I am truly delighted with the warm welcome from everyone today. I will bravely accept it today. How will I respond to everyone in the future? Only by disregarding everything, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, with the determination to sacrifice, will I do the work of reviving China, rescuing the masses, and eliminating the Red bandits. Finally, I loudly appeal to use my courage and determination to eliminate the Red bandits in order to repay the enthusiasm of today's welcome from all walks of life." (August 27)</p>

Li Zufu, the district chief of the first district, proposed that the land survey should continue according to the original plan. Otherwise, he requested that the collection of the land survey acreage tax be stopped from the 23rd year. The resolution was forwarded for review. The Provincial Government's Financial Order No. 1470, Land Order No. 55, stated that the household land survey was originally one of the planned tasks, and it still needs to be carried out. Because this province previously received an order from Chairman Chiang to complete the land survey before the end of March of the 24th year, the implementation steps have been slightly improved. The purpose is to seek the rapid completion of land consolidation work and the early resolution of land disputes, which is the same as the expectations of the people of the county. As for allowing the people to measure themselves, the original intention was to allow the people to participate in the land survey themselves, so that the land boundaries would be more accurate, so as to avoid errors and inconsistencies afterward. The employee-assisted layer refers to the situation where the owner cannot participate in person. The survey personnel are still responsible for the technical matters. As for the business expenses, because the scope of the business has not changed, the survey fee should still be collected according to the original plan to meet the needs. The request to stop collecting the survey fee should not be considered.</p>

<p>Nangxiang Police Officer is Accused of Dereliction of Duty and Corruption</p>
<p>The police force in Nanxiang has always been known for its darkness. In the past six months, cases of police officers accepting bribes and dereliction of duty have occurred one after another. Unexpectedly, Wu Zexing, the newly appointed police officer, had not been in office for a month when another case of dereliction of duty and corruption occurred. The incident occurred a week ago when a certain patrol leader from the sub-station asked Wang Zhang, the wife of the deceased Wang Aliuliu, who sold red pills and opium in Taikang Bridge South, for a customary fee. Zhang refused. The patrol leader reported to Wu Zexing, the police officer of the sub-station, who ordered the police to search the house and seized 152 taels of opium, a large bag of red pills, two gold rings, and 50 silver dollars. The people and the loot were taken to the station. Zhang has a daughter who has a relationship with Wang Xiuqing, a well-known rogue in the town who is known as a police detective. Wang and township police officer Guan Jiaxiang tried to arrange things. They agreed with Wu Zexing at Wang's home to send the two gold rings, 50 silver dollars, 148 taels of opium, and a large bag of red pills to the police officer Wu Zexing. In addition, Zhang would pay 300 silver dollars to Wu Zexing as a birthday gift. The remaining four taels of opium and Zhang were escorted by the station to the county Public Security Bureau on the 25th and then to the county government. Because Zhang had registered with the Opium Prohibition Committee and obtained a license to smoke opium, and because the official opium shop had not yet been established, Zhang believed that this small amount of opium was for her own consumption and should not be considered a crime according to law. The method of corruption cannot be said to be not thorough and meticulous. Unexpectedly, Zhang's sale of opium had long been an open secret. The townspeople were surprised by this sudden arrest and paid close attention to it. The people involved in the case thought that the secrets could be concealed, but the rumors had already been heard by County Chief Xu, who sent a secret investigator to the town to investigate. After Zhang was sent to the county, County Chief Xu summoned Wu Zexing to the case and questioned him personally. Zhang only admitted to smoking opium. Wu's confession was consistent with Zhang's. County Chief Xu ordered Zhang to be detained for investigation, and Wu was released on bail. Unexpectedly, Wu Zexing volunteered to be detained to await investigation to show that he had no other intention. Later, County Chief Xu, because there was no evidence in the case, entrusted Zeng Guochen, a prison guard, to have his daughter (a graduate of Xinhua University of the Arts), Zeng Xixi, go to the women's detention center to try to find out the truth from Wang Zhang. Zhang revealed the truth, so County Chief Xu re-summoned and questioned them and summoned Zeng Xixi to confront them. Zhang had no choice but to confess the truth, and police officer Wu also pleaded guilty. The case became clear. It is said that Wu Zexing is the wife's brother of Ye Xiufeng, a member of the provincial government. County Chief Xu, because the case involves the sale of red pills and the corruption of police officers, will order the summoning of all parties concerned to investigate the details and send them to the province for legal action.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Suzhou-Kunshan Ship Robbed</p>
<p>The Hu Arong boat, which runs between Suzhou and Kunshan, was sailing from Kunshan to Suzhou yesterday at dawn. When the boat passed the Liulidian area outside Xiaoximen, two bandits suddenly ordered it to stop on the shore and showed their guns. Hu had no choice but to moor the boat. The two bandits boarded the boat and robbed it, taking more than 100 silver dollars and fleeing. Afterwards, Hu drove the boat back to Kunshan and reported it to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Industrial Bank to Open</h3>
<p>The businesses in this county have been affected by the bankruptcy of the rural economy, resulting in a sluggish market. However, the banking industry has been quite developed. The Shanghai Ningbo Industrial Bank, in view of this, has specially added a branch in this county, renting the Qiu family's house in Beida Street as the bank site. It has been repaired overnight and has been completed. It is scheduled to open on September 3. The bank's business includes various deposits, warehouse mortgages, savings, etc. The manager and deputy manager of the branch are Lu Zutong and Hu Shutang, who were hired by Wu Zhihao, the general manager of the head office. It is said that the Shanghai Bank of Communications will also set up a branch in this county and is currently looking for suitable houses.</p>

<p>Continued Rainfall, Rice Prices Recover</p>
<p>Since the rain fell in our county the day before yesterday, the farmland in the surrounding countryside has benefited a lot, and the people's hearts have been slightly relieved. Yesterday at midnight, the sky was cloudy again, and there was lightning. At about one o'clock, there was heavy rain, and then it rained steadily for about two hours before stopping. The urban area only received half an inch of rain. The northwest countryside, such as Hengshan Bridge, received the most rain, about one inch. The rice crops were moisturized, and the farmers were all rejoicing, as if they had obtained gold. The water in the urban river rose by three or four inches in the past two days. Yesterday, rice prices also recovered slightly. High-quality white japonica rice was sold for 12 yuan and 70 cents, which was 50 cents less than the highest price.</p>
<h3>Ancient Stone Buddha Found in River</h3>
<p>At the two places of Kuatang Bridge and Qingming Bridge outside the south gate of this county, boats often have their bottoms broken when passing. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, Jiang Huanqing and other gentlemen in Nanli initiated the dredging of the river from Huangni Bridge to Rihui Bridge. A stone land god was found in the river under Kuatang Bridge. After it was salvaged, the boats sailed safely. The general ignorant people all said that the stone land god was spiritual, because they did not salvage it and enshrine it before, so the boats were broken. At about 10:00 am yesterday, Cai Arong, a partner in a noodle shop near Qingming Bridge, found a stone Buddha in the river under Qingming Bridge when he was washing his hands by the river. He salvaged it. The stone Buddha weighs about 300 jin, the head has been destroyed, it is about three feet long and one foot four or five inches wide, the left hand holds a round teacher ingot, the right hand holds a stone ruyi, and there are two stone ribbons on the back. The words "Rebuilt Qingming Bridge Gudan in the first year of Xianfeng of the Great Qing Dynasty" and "Zhang Qinglin, a stonemason in Shiputou outside the South Gate" are chiseled on it. Now, the ignorant people there have hired workers to pour a head with cement for enshrinement.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Police Officer Accused of Seducing and Raping Women</p>
<p>Yu Hanwen, a police officer from the Juxing Town Public Security Sub-Station in the Fifth District, induced good family women Shi Shuzhen and Gong Sulan to have adulterous coitus at the Liumen Hotel in the county and city on the 22nd of this month. They were surrounded and extorted by many hooligans, which caused a sensation in the neighborhood. Many people gathered to watch. Later, the matter was mediated by Liu Changtai, the owner of the hotel. Now, Shi Zhenpeng and other people in the district believe that Yu, as a public official, openly seduced and raped women from good families, which is a serious violation of the law and dereliction of duty. Yesterday, they specially petitioned the Nantong District Commissioner's Office to send someone to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Escorted to Rugao</p>
<p>The young grandson of Yuan Xiangji of Dingnan, Rugao, was kidnapped by bandits for ransom. After the ransom was sent, the child had died tragically. The bandits then sought another beggar child to replace the little meat ticket and sent him back. Yuan Xiangji was very sad and angry and reported it to the authorities for investigation. Cong Buqing, the bandit leader in the case, was in Tong and was taken by the security team to Rugao to be brought to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Major Fire in Songjia Village for Three Days</p>
<p>Songjia Village, in the Fourth District of Shaoxing, is remotely located in the mountains. There has been no rain for two months this summer. The streams are dry, and the trees, bamboo, tea, and mulberry on the mountains have all withered. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out on the mountains there some time ago for some unknown reason. In an instant, it became a prairie fire. Because there was no water to put it out, it was allowed to burn for three days and has not yet subsided. It is estimated that thousands of acres of land have been burned.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Ambassadors Yan and Gu Arrived in Shanghai on the Same Ship Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>They Will Go to Nanjing to Meet with Wang and to Jiangxi to Meet with Chiang on the Same Day</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu Observes That the Russo-Japanese War Will Not Break Out</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Dr. Yan Huiqing, China's ambassador to Soviet Russia, and Dr. Gu Weijun, China's minister to France, went to Qingdao for summer vacation last month. Now it has been a month. Because the heat has subsided, they took the Jardine Matheson Company's Hesheng ship to Shanghai on the 26th. The ship arrived in Shanghai at five o'clock yesterday morning. After arriving in Shanghai, Ambassador Yan rested briefly and took an early train to Nanjing. The minister took the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Nanjing at 4:00 pm to meet with Premier Wang and is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Jiangxi this morning to meet with Chairman Chiang. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai on the Same Ship Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Hesheng ship entered the port at 4:00 am yesterday and docked at Shuntai Wharf at 5:00 am. After getting off the ship, Ambassador Yan went directly to Yan Fuqing's residence to rest briefly. Then, he went to the North Station and took an early train to Nanjing. Very few people knew about it. Minister Gu returned to his private residence on Maigen Road. After resting briefly, he drove to Qiqi Road at around 9:00 am to visit Song Ziwen, the standing committee member of the National Economic Commission. They talked for an hour. Then, he visited friends. In the afternoon at 4:00 pm, he took the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Nanjing to meet with Premier Wang and is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Jiangxi this morning to meet with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Did Not Discuss Politics in Qingdao</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Minister Gu received the Central News Agency reporter at his residence and made a statement, saying that he had suffered a heat stroke due to the hot weather, so he went to Qingdao for summer vacation. He has now recovered. Song Ziwen, a member of the National Economic Commission, and Ambassador Yan, the ambassador to Russia, also came to Qingdao for a short stay because of the heat. Because they were in the same place, they met often, which aroused speculation from the outside world. Some even said that they held a meeting in Qingdao to discuss diplomatic issues, which is ridiculous. They went to Qingdao without prior agreement. Although there were many opportunities to meet, they only talked about private matters and never involved national affairs, let alone discussed diplomatic issues.</p>
<h3>Succession as Foreign Minister Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>Minister Gu said that the reports in the foreign press that Premier Wang would resign from his concurrent position as Foreign Minister due to the busy government affairs of the Executive Yuan and that Gu would take over the position are not true. He also said that Premier Wang has no intention of resigning from his concurrent position as Foreign Minister and that the central government has absolutely no intention of changing the Foreign Minister. All the rumors from the outside world are unreliable. Minister Gu continued to say that this time he asked for leave to return to the country mostly to take care of private matters. After returning to the country, he went to Qingdao for summer vacation due to heat stroke, and he did not have time to take care of anything. Therefore, the date of his return to work has not yet been determined. He will probably stay for another month or two.</p>
<h3>Observing the Russo-Japanese Issue</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent tense situation between Japan and Russia, Gu did not want to elaborate on it, only saying that Japan and Russia have had many disputes recently due to the Middle East Road issue, but according to his observation, war between the two countries will not break out immediately. He hoped that they would not start a war. As for the US government's recent increase in the price of silver and purchase of silver, it has aroused speculation from the outside world, and it is believed that the US purchase of silver is actively preparing for war. This is also a kind of speculation. However, he knew that the United States is rich in silver and ranks second in the world.</p>
<h3>Went to Nanjing and Then to Jiangxi That Night</h3>
<p>Minister Gu finally said that Ambassador Yan had already taken the early train to Nanjing this morning (that is, yesterday morning). As for his trip to Nanjing, it was specifically to meet with Premier Wang. Of course, he would report on the diplomatic situation when they met. Since he had returned to China, he had not met with Chairman Chiang, so he decided to go to Nanjing to meet with Premier Wang and then go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang and report on the situation abroad. He had not yet decided whether Ambassador Yan would travel with him to Jiangxi. The reporter then inquired about Ambassador Yan and learned that Ambassador Yan had decided to go to Nanjing to meet with Premier Wang, then go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang, and then return to Nanjing to change trains to Tianjin to take care of private matters, and then go to Beiping to see a doctor at Xiehe Hospital for his heart disease. The date of his return to work would be after his heart disease was cured. Because heart disease is not suitable for living in areas with colder weather, and the weather in Russia is very cold, even more so than in China.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Johnson of the Belgian King Went North Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Belgian Consul General in Shanghai Also Accompanied Him</p>
<p>Special Envoy Baron Johnson and his party of eight, specially sent by King Leopold III of Belgium to China for a return visit, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. They took the Shanghai-Nanjing train north yesterday afternoon to travel. They will first go to Xuzhou, then transfer to the Longhai Railway to Zhengzhou, and then transfer to the train to Beiping. Tan Erfu, the counselor of the Belgian embassy and consul general in Shanghai, also accompanied them on the same train yesterday.</p>
<h3>Food Commission Restricts Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Resolution Passed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Special Price Must Not Exceed 13 Yuan and 50 Cents</p>
<p>A Petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to Enforce Strictly</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The Municipal Food Commission held its 43rd regular meeting at the Cuixiutang in the City God Temple at 1:00 pm yesterday. Zhang Binghui, the chief of the Fourth Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, chaired the meeting, and Zhou Minggang, the director of the Food Stock Section, recorded the meeting. Two important cases were resolved. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees at yesterday's meeting included Chen Jixi, Yao Yuanxun, Jiang Shizhi, Sun Yongyi, Yu Zixiang, Zhang Binghui, Wu Huanru, Gu Xinyi, Huang Yinong, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhou Minggang, Cai Yukun, Lu Wenshao, and others.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Zhang Binghui gave a report, saying that the resolutions of the 42nd regular meeting of the committee had been reported to the Social Affairs Bureau separately and specially reported to the municipal government for approval. However, no approval had been received so far, so the previously agreed-upon purchase of foreign rice had not yet been carried out. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the fact that there are many rice businesses in the city that are automatically ordering foreign rice, if there are no restrictions, the new grains will be on the market in the future, and orders will flood in, which will inevitably cause low grain prices and hurt farmers. This is something that should be prevented. Some committee members also gave reports, which are omitted.</p>
<h3>Key Resolutions</h3>
<p>After the report, the discussion began. 1. The drought situation in various places recently is serious, which has led to rising rice prices. Fearing that there will be a rice shortage in the future, how should preventive and relief measures be formulated? After discussion, it was resolved to petition the municipal government to forward the petition to the Executive Yuan, ordering the provincial governments of Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang to follow the established cases for the circulation of domestic grains and not to prohibit the export of rice or collect passport donations in order to regulate the people's food. (Explanation: Recently, Hunan Province collected a passport donation of one yuan per stone, Anhui Province prohibited the export of rice from Wuhu, and Zhejiang Province prohibited the export of rice from Wenzhou and Taizhou.) 2. Because the source of rice in the city is scarce and the demand exceeds the supply, the market price of river rice has exceeded the previously set price. Should it be re-regulated, and should standard prices be set for the top, second, and third grades for compliance and to avoid taking advantage of loopholes? After public discussion, it was resolved to set the price of special top-grade japonica rice not to exceed 13 yuan and 50 cents. The prices of the middle and second grades should be set separately according to the standard price and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for promulgation and strict enforcement.</p>
<h3>Discussion Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the attending committee members debated fiercely on the issue of restricting rice prices. Some committee members advocated that the price of special top-grade rice should not be restricted, while the price of lower-grade rice should be restricted. Other committee members believed that the current high rice prices are mostly due to the manipulation of the exchange and financial circles, so restricting rice prices is not effective in practice. The authorities should strictly crack down on speculators' manipulation. During the discussion of the case, someone also explained that the import of foreign rice not only does not help to suppress rice prices but will also cause a panic in the rice market in the future. Therefore, the discussion of the case took more than two hours, and no concrete solution was reached. It is said that the dispute is greatly related to the conflict of interests within the rice industry.</p>
<h3>Wu Huanru's Remarks</h3>
<p>After the meeting, the Central News Agency reporter asked Wu Huanru, the chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, about the restriction of rice prices. According to Wu, he (Wu himself) did not advocate restricting rice prices. Now that a standard has been set, the price still exceeds this number in practice. However, the rice industry is also in a difficult situation due to cost constraints, so he had advocated that merchants order foreign rice. When the foreign rice is sold in the future, it should be supervised by the government. If there is a loss, the government should give a subsidy as appropriate. If the price of rice is too high in the future, this can be circulated in the market to suppress rice prices. However, this is now difficult to implement. Hunan rice originally supplied 20 million stones to other provinces every year, and Anhui and Jiangxi provinces also had surpluses. However, this year, due to the drought, only Hunan Province has a surplus, and other provinces feel a shortage. Fujian Province has never had surplus rice to supply other provinces, but this year there has been a bumper harvest in southern Fujian, which has not been seen in decades. However, judging from the current situation, the rise and fall of domestic rice prices is not determined by the amount of domestic rice production. The harvest or failure of rice-producing areas abroad has a great impact. For example, in the 19th year of the Republic of China, domestic rice prices soared to 20 yuan, but soon the domestic new rice came on the market due to the dumping of foreign rice, and rice prices plummeted. Therefore, according to his observation, although the United States and India are also affected by famine internationally and demand rice from other countries, Saigon, Yangon, and other places are still having bumper harvests. Although the country is affected by drought, it is not as severe as the rumors say. Therefore, when the new grains are on the market, rice prices may not rise again and may even fall back, which is also expected. However, when the next spring harvest comes, there will be a rice shortage. If there is no preparation at that time, the panic situation of the people's food will be beyond our expectations.</p>
<h3>Li Jingzong Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Smooth Progress on the Eurasia Route</p>
<p>Li Jingzong, the general manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, returned to Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday. He had traveled to Gansu on the 21st of this month to urgently seek the restoration of the Xinjiang air route and the implementation of through Eurasia air transport. He discussed the restoration plan with the Chairman of Gansu Province, Ma Hongkui, and others, achieving satisfactory results. He told the reporter from the Huadong News Agency about the detailed results of this trip. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>The Trip Was Quite Smooth</h3>
<p>Li first stated that the central government urgently needs to complete Northwest transportation to develop the Northwest. Moreover, Eurasia Aviation also focuses on the Northwest. Therefore, the central government had ordered the company to operate the Lanzhou to Ningxia section of the air route. However, since the start of operations on the 15th of last month, business has not improved. Therefore, he flew to Gansu on the 21st to discuss active policies with Chairman Ma, and satisfactory results have been achieved. After seeking instructions from Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, it can be implemented immediately. One of the items is strongly supported by the Gansu Provincial Government, which is that after the Ningxia to Baotou section of the air route can be opened, all valuable goods produced along the route can be transported by airplane, which can avoid losses and increase freight revenue, reducing the company's burden.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Xinjiang Restoration Difficult</h3>
<p>As for the Shanghai-Dihua (Urumqi) route between Shanghai and Xinjiang, it has been suspended for nearly a year. The company has always planned to resume it. However, Governor Sheng has not expressed any positive intention, making it difficult for the company to start. If Governor Sheng sends a telegram inviting the company to negotiate, he will immediately go to Xinjiang. As of now, the company has sent dozens of telegrams to Governor Sheng, but Sheng has not replied, making it extremely difficult to resume the route, he said.</p>
<h3>To Report to the Capital Soon</h3>
<p>The two new aircraft ordered by the company were originally expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month. However, due to the difficulty in restoring the Shanghai-Xinjiang route, the progress has been delayed. This time, he went to Gansu and stayed for two days on his way back to Shanghai due to the climate. He departed from Lanzhou yesterday morning and stopped in Luoyang. He departed at 5:30 this morning and arrived at Hongqiao Airport at 9:00 AM. He will go to the capital to report on the trip's progress as soon as Minister Zhu returns to Beijing from Jiangxi so that the Ningxia-Lanzhou-Baotou route can be implemented as soon as possible, he said.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Resigned and Went to Chongqing, Wang Sent a Telegram to Sichuan to Console and Retain Him</h3>
<p>Military and Financial Situation Both Stable</p>
<p>Various Armies Have Not Yet Expressed Their Attitude</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, suddenly left Chengdu through the East Gate on the morning of the 23rd of this month with a small number of attendants and returned directly to his private residence in Chongqing. He also left a letter instructing that a telegram be sent to the central government to resign from all his concurrent posts. At a time when the bandit problem in Sichuan Province has not been resolved, Liu's sudden passivity has a significant impact. The reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency specially visited Deng Mingjie and Fu Zhenwu, Liu's representatives in Shanghai, yesterday, and they told him that President Wang had already sent a telegram to Sichuan to console and retain Liu, as well as the various situations before and after. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Details of the Departure</h3>
<p>According to the two representatives, although they had noticed Liu's passive attitude beforehand, they did not expect him to be so determined. According to a telegram from Chengdu, Liu led a small number of attendants out of Chengdu's East Gate on the morning of the 23rd, and the various duties of the headquarters and governor's office were temporarily performed by the two chiefs of staff, Guo Wenqin and Li Jianming. For a time, his whereabouts were unknown, and rumors spread, causing widespread surprise. Military operations were also temporarily suspended. Later, it was discovered that Liu was at his private residence in Libazi, a suburb of Chongqing. After earnest appeals from leaders from all walks of life, Liu verbally agreed to try to maintain the situation before the central government approved his resignation.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Resignation</h3>
<p>The reporter then inquired about the reasons for Liu's sudden resignation. They said that Liu was a resolute and responsible person who would never be passive unless absolutely necessary. This sudden departure was due to his unavoidable difficulties. However, the setback in the bandit suppression military operations and the failure of the generals of the various armies to advance together, resulting in a reversal from victory to defeat in the Wanyuan and Tongjiang areas, was what Liu was most saddened by.</p>
<h3>Wang Sent a Telegram to Console and Retain Him</h3>
<p>The two representatives continued that President Wang had sent a reply telegram to Liu to console and retain him, with earnest words. The people of Sichuan Province also urgently hope that Liu will return to his post as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Attitudes of Various Armies</h3>
<p>Liu and Fu also told the reporter that although Liu's departure from Chengdu had caused a stir, it quickly subsided. The bandit suppression military operations are still being carried out by the Fifth Route Army, which is confronting the Red bandits in the [missing characters] area.</p>
<p>The financial situation is also still stable. As for the military leaders of the various routes, they inevitably feel anxious about Liu's resignation and the sudden loss of a central figure of leadership, but there has been no concrete expression, they said.</p>

The recent requests for introductions are described below:</p>
<h3>London Needs Porcelain</h3>
<p>Jingdezhen porcelain is famous worldwide. Currently, the London company Hansford &amp; Sons specializes in importing high-quality Chinese porcelain.

<h3>Sanbei Company Postpones Receiving Lianhe</h3>

<p>The Sanbei Company purchased the Lianhe ship from Jardine Matheson for 185,000 yuan, originally planning to increase the Shanghai-Ningbo route, with the Ningxing ship operating on alternate days. All preparations were completed, and it was scheduled to pay Jardine Matheson on the 18th of this month to take over the ship. However, the industry paid close attention to this matter, and Sanbei, for overall planning purposes, also temporarily postponed the payment and takeover of the ship. Now it has been confirmed that the ship will be allowed to be paid and taken over by Sanbei in early September. It still needs to be docked for repairs and the flag and name need to be changed. After taking over this ship, Sanbei plans to change its route to the Yangtze River and not join the Shanghai-Ningbo route.</p>

<h3>Principles for Expanding Warehouses at Various Stations on Two Railways Determined: Borrowing from Banks</h3>
<p>Collateral: Real Estate and Constructed Warehouses</p>
<p>Syndicate Has Sent Members to Inspect Various Stations</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus are negotiating with the Shanghai banking community for investment to expand warehouses at various stations. Various banks have sent members to inspect. Now, the principle has been agreed upon as borrowing. Detailed methods still need to be further discussed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspecting Various Stations</h3>
<p>After the two railway bureaus contacted the Shanghai banking community for investment to build warehouses along the lines, the contacting banks, such as the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, jointly with the two railway bureaus, went to inspect various stations along the two lines. Now, the various stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line, such as Shanghai South Station, Rihui Port, Zha Kou, Cao'e River, etc., have been inspected. The various stations on the Beijing-Shanghai line, such as Nanjing Jiangbian, Zhenjiang Jiangbian, Changzhou, Wuxi,</p>
<h3>Postal Savings Bureau's Income and Savings Have Increased Significantly This Year</h3>
<p>Totaling 33 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Investing in National Production Businesses</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Xu Baiyuan, the deputy director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, told the visiting reporter from the Central News Agency that the savings bureau's income and savings this year totaled 33 million yuan, with increases in all regions. As for the lending part, it will focus on national and social production businesses to benefit the people's livelihood. It is currently preparing for the consignment business to benefit merchants and regulate the finance of rural and urban areas. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Increase in Savings</h3>
<p>Deputy Director Xu told the reporter that the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau received a total of 33 million yuan in savings this year, an increase of about 31% compared to 25 million yuan in the 21st year. All regions have increased, and Shaanxi, Beiping, Hebei, and Fujian have exceeded the average increase. Shaanxi is about 140%, Beiping is 80%, Hebei is 65%, and Fujian is 45%. In the above-mentioned regions, there were phenomena of natural disasters, local unrest, and social and economic instability in the past year. However, the savings in the Postal Savings Bureau have increased, indicating that people's confidence in the Postal Savings Bureau has increased. In order to protect the interests of depositors, the bureau should choose the most reliable and profitable way to engage in investment business. Mr. Xu then talked about</p>
<h3>Investment Goals</h3>
<p>He said that in the past, various directors mostly engaged in investment businesses such as real estate and government bonds. Since Director Tang took office, he changed the goal and no longer increased investment in real estate, but engaged in investment in national and social construction businesses. For example, the railway construction loan recently deposited by the Shanghai banking community, the bureau participated in the investment with the most favorable position. As for the report that the bureau will try to handle rural loans in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, it is said that there was such an intention before. The former deputy director, Cheng Shifan, had also inspected various places along the Longhai Railway and planned to engage in it. However, it was feared that the various branches would not be competent in handling loans, so it was shelved. Currently, 200,000 yuan is deposited in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Farmers Bank. In terms of name and procedures, it is a peer-to-peer transaction. The bureau can withdraw the funds at any time when needed. However, since the Farmers Bank's business is rural loans, it actually has the significance of assisting loans to relieve rural areas.</p>
<h3>Planned Consignment</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu continued to talk about the bureau's current plan to handle the consignment business, planning to handle it first in various places along the Longhai and Jiaoji Railways. The above-mentioned places mostly export agricultural products such as cotton and beans. In the past, when goods were shipped out, payment was made after the goods arrived, or the buyer paid the goods in advance. There was a feeling of inconvenience in the financial aspect. In the future, if merchants have goods shipped out, they can submit the bill of lading and insurance policy to the bureau for loan, so that commerce can be developed, and rural and urban finance can be circulated. This method will be implemented around the end of this year or early next year.</p>
<h3>Assisting the Post Office</h3>
<p>The bureau is now planning to invest in post offices and build offices for post offices in various regions. Currently, there are more than 5,000 post offices, and only more than 50 have built their own houses. The houses are small and require the payment of huge rents every year. Therefore, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau plans to invest in construction and has obtained the consent of the Post Office. It will take four years and invest 500,000 to 1 million yuan in advance to build multiple larger offices and pay back the principal and interest on a monthly basis. After the repayment is completed, the offices will belong to the Post Office, and then the second phase of construction will be carried out. It will take about one or two decades to complete the construction of post offices nationwide, he said. Mr. Xu was ordered to participate in the National Postal Conference to be held in Beijing on September 1 and is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight. Director Tang is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 31st, he said.</p>
<h3>Guarantee Reserve Management Method for Savings Banks Approved</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Informs Central Bank to Follow</p>
<p>According to Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, the Ministry of Finance has approved the establishment of a custody committee for the guarantee reserve fund that should be deposited.</p>
<h3>Principles Determined</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday that the two railway bureaus have agreed with the banks on the principle of borrowing to build warehouses. The borrowing banks are Shanghai Bank, Bank of Communications, New China Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The collateral is (1) the completed warehouses at various stations and (2) the railway bureau's real estate for building warehouses. As for the interest rate and the total amount of the loan, further discussions are needed. When the loan contract is signed in the future, one party will be the Ministry of Railways, and the other party will be the syndicate formed by the borrowing banks.</p>
<p>Suzhou, Maigen Road, Shanghai North Railway Station, Wusong, etc., still need to continue to inspect.</p>
<p>The meeting also approved 12 articles of the custody management method and informed the Central Bank to follow them. The details obtained by the reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency and the method for acting as the custodian of savings bank bonds and assets are recorded on the left.</p>

In addition to the custody management method drafted by the Central Bank, in order to show great fairness and credibility to the society, the Savings Deposit Guarantee Reserve Custody Committee is now specially organized. The committee is composed of seven members, and the list has now been released as follows: one person from the Ministry of Finance (Dai Mingli), two people from the Central Bank (Zhou Shouliang, Zheng Weichuan), two people from the Bankers' Association (Qu Jigang, Wang Zhixin), and two people from banks and savings associations other than member banks (Qian Xinzhi, Si Bimen). According to news from the banking community, all members have now been released, and it is planned to formally establish the committee in the near future.</p>

When the market price of the government bonds, treasury bills, or other assets deposited by a savings bank falls, causing their actual value to decrease by 5%, this bank will notify the savings bank to make up for it immediately. When the market price rises, causing their value to increase by 5%, the savings bank may also apply to return the excess amount. Article 6. The government bonds, treasury bills, or assets deposited by a savings bank can only be withdrawn after this bank receives a public letter notice from the Ministry of Finance. Article 7. When the government bonds, treasury bills, or assets deposited by a savings bank are received, paid, or exchanged, the custody certificate should be brought along for registration, and this bank will fill out a report form and report it to the Ministry of Finance. Article 8. The principal and interest receivable on the government bonds, treasury bills, or assets deposited by a savings bank should be collected by the savings bank with the custody certificate and a receipt from this bank's custody vault. However, if this reduces the amount of government bonds, treasury bills, or assets and causes it to be less than one-quarter of the total amount of deposits, it should be made up for immediately. Article 9. This bank will fill out a monthly report form at the end of each month and report it to the Ministry of Finance. Article 10.

<h3>Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov Went to Beijing</h3>
<p>Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, took the overnight express train to Beijing yesterday. Chen Ce, Zhu Jiqing, and others also traveled with him.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Miao Did Not Borrow Money from Shanghai Banks</h3>
<p>Reported Misinformation</p>
<p>The report that Miao Qiujie, who also serves as the Commissioner of Salt Transport for the Two Huai, borrowed 10 million yuan from Shanghai banks to build salt warehouses on the four banks and relieve the livelihood of the 12 Weiyun workers, and negotiated in Bengbu, is misinformation and does not exist. Commissioner Miao was recently in Bengbu to resolve the dispute between the transportation merchants and the lending banks. Furthermore, the Salt Affairs Office and the Salt Affairs Audit Office have never had such a plan for this huge loan.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Resumes Selling Ping-Sui Joint Tickets</h3>

<h3>Finance Bureau Schedules Regular Appraisal of Accumulated Grain Real Estate</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the division of the original accumulated grain property between the city and Shanghai County, in 1930, a Real Estate Evaluation Committee was jointly formed by the city and county, and the city side was composed of the Society, Public Works, Land, and Finance Bureaus, as well as the Supervisory Committee for the original public property and public funds, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, each sending a representative to form the organization. At that time, it was resolved that the valuation matters would be handled jointly by both parties, convened by Gu Xin-yi, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Subsequently, in May 1931, Gu Xin-yi sent a letter to the Finance Bureau with a list of the prices of the evaluated bases and houses, along with drawings. After convening various parties to discuss, it was resolved to adopt the bidding method, and after the bidding, the distribution would be made according to the original city-county ratio of 63% to 37%. Except for the accumulated grain property used by the Shanghai Public Hospital, which is a relief project, it was resolved not to divide it for the time being. The matter was reported to the municipal government for approval. On April 17 of this year, the association convened related parties to discuss. At that time, the county representative proposed that, in addition to explaining the case of separately planning to establish a county hospital at the Shanghai Hospital site, it was proposed to allocate the houses and land from the east side of Li Ma Road to the Wai Ma Road to the county, and calculate according to the city-county ratio of 63% to 37%. The county would gain 3.51% more land and lose 19 houses, which seemed fair. It was resolved on the spot: (1) The Shanghai County representative proposed to change the bidding and division method, and the city's related bureaus would jointly submit a request to the municipal government for instructions before convening another meeting. (2) The county's plan to include the Shanghai Hospital land and property in the division should be submitted to the government for instructions and verification in the same case. It is now learned that the municipal government's instructions for the above two resolutions are as follows: The meeting presented the full details. Regarding the request for instructions, (1) the evaluation committee should be reconvened for re-evaluation. (2) The original plan should be maintained. Please comply with this order, etc. After receiving the order, the committee has planned to convene representatives of all related parties at 2:00 PM on September 6 to discuss the re-evaluation method by the Municipal Finance Bureau.</p>
<h3>US Exchange Allows Opening of Chinese Silk Auction Amidst Decline of Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>Brokers Pass, Implementation Possible on the 4th of Next Month</p>
<p>Factories Struggle to Maintain, Eagerly Awaiting Government Relief</p>
<p>After the decline of the Chinese silk industry, the market prices of Chinese silk in Europe and the United States plummeted, and silk factories struggled to maintain. The government has begun to find ways to provide relief. The New York market has agreed to open the auction of Chinese silk and will schedule its implementation. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with silk merchant leader Chu Huiseng yesterday and received detailed information, which is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk Auction</h3>
<p>The US New York market exchange has always auctioned Japanese silk. Chinese and Italian silk have never been auctioned. A request was made previously, but it was not allowed because Chinese silk had no standard grading. This time, the New York market exchange for Italian silk has agreed to open the auction. China requested that it be handled in accordance with the precedent, and the exchange has now agreed to the request. However, it must wait for the brokers to vote. If it passes, it will be implemented on September 4.</p>
<h3>Japan Occupies First Place</h3>
<p>Affected by the dumping of Japanese silk in the US market, Japanese silk currently occupies the first place, Chinese silk occupies the second place, and Italian silk occupies the third place. Total annual sales are about 600,000 dan. If the opening of the Chinese silk auction becomes a reality, then Chinese silk will have the possibility of activity in the US. Currently, Chinese silk exports are still scarce. B-grade 20-22 thread test is 420 yuan per dan, but there are no large transactions. Calculated at cost, it is still a loss.</p>
<h3>Promotion Issues</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of Chinese silk promotion, Chu Huiseng and Shen Huachen jointly formulated a plan, suggesting the establishment of a controlled Chinese silk promotion association. After contacting He Bingxian, the director of the International Trade Bureau, a decision was made to first form a promotion agency to promote abroad. As for the entire plan, it will be considered further. However, because the price of silk abroad is lower than that in China, silk merchants require that the entire plan be carried out simultaneously so that domestic surpluses can make up for foreign losses.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Maintain</h3>
<p>Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been unable to maintain due to the continuous decline in Chinese silk exports and have successively closed down. Of those struggling to maintain, as of now, there are 18 in Zhejiang, about 28 in Jiangsu, and less than 30 in Shanghai. If silk prices remain low, then the factories will be unable to maintain and will close down altogether. What silk merchants expect is that the government will find ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Kowloon Children's Bookstore Lowers Prices to Help Relief</h3>
<p>The China Foreign Relief Association at 97 Yan Kee Road in this city has noted that this summer, the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces have suffered severe droughts, crops have withered and died, and most of the autumn harvest has been disappointing. The situation in the disaster areas is quite difficult. For years, overseas Chinese have been very concerned about domestic disaster relief charities. The Hong Kong Kowloon Children's Bookstore, in view of this drought disaster, held a five-day mega sale from August 16 to August 20, and all proceeds from the sale of goods, amounting to HK$328.20, were allocated for relief funds. In addition, an anonymous person donated HK$200, which was also remitted to the association by the Hong Kong Tung Wah Hospital, designated for the disaster areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. At this time when the people are starving, every bit of charitable millet and benevolence is a source of life, it is said.</p>
<h3>徽zhou Area Bandit Alarm Spreads; Huining Compatriots in Shanghai Hold Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>The Huining Compatriots Association in Shanghai, after reporting the bandit alarm in Huangjian, Shexian County, the day before yesterday, in addition to urgently telegramming Hangzhou to request the dispatch of security forces to Huizhou to block and suppress the bandits, also telegraphed the Nanchang Headquarters, ordering nearby bandit suppression troops to quickly encircle them together. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The association yesterday (the 27th) specially convened an emergency meeting, publicly electing Cao Zhigong as chairman. He reported on the bandit alarm news received, and then discussions were held. This time, bandits from Kaihua infiltrated Huangjian. The local people and militia fought bravely against the bandits, eventually repelling them. Their courageous spirit is truly admirable. The association should commend them to encourage them. It was resolved to send a letter of commendation and donate 100 silver dollars, to be remitted to the Tunxi Chamber of Commerce for forwarding. (2) Regarding the request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to quickly send a large army to assist in the suppression, it was resolved that, in addition to sending a telegram requesting assistance, another telegram should be sent to Mr. Cheng Zhuxin in Hangzhou as a representative to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government. (3) Regarding the severe drought disaster in the hometown and how to provide relief urgently, it was resolved to organize a Huining Disaster Relief Committee to seek practical relief, and dozens of people, including Yang Xiaotian, Jin Liren, Zhu Jing'an, Zhu Douwen, Zhu Rushan, and Cheng Hengjiu, were immediately elected as committee members. (4) Regarding the previous resolution to send representatives to consult with the persons responsible for the grain fund custody in various counties, striving for a swift solution. (5) Regarding the Hang-Hui Highway Sheyu Automobile Company's excessive collection of operating vehicle passage fees, which is a clear violation of orders, it was resolved to, based on the "Regulations on the Collection of Operating Vehicle Passage Fees by Commercial Automobile Companies in the Five Provinces and Cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai" decided and formulated by the Transportation Committee, telegraph the Transportation Committee, the Economic Committee, the Anhui Provincial Government, and the Anhui Construction Department to order them to stop it. (6) Regarding the case of Wang Xizhen, a fellow townsman from Jing County, seeking redress for his son, Wang Pingwen, who was implicated and arrested due to a student surnamed Liu, it was resolved to forward a letter to the Public Security Bureau. Finally, due to rumors and unstable news in Tunxi, a telegram was sent to Commissioner Liu in Tunxi and the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Luo, to inquire about the truth. The meeting adjourned after discussions.</p>
<h3>Shexian Compatriots Association Telegrams Anhui Provincial Government to Request Exemption from This Year's Land Tax</h3>
<p>The Shexian Compatriots Association in Shanghai, considering the extraordinary severity of the drought in the county, the worst in sixty years, in addition to discussing fundamental relief measures in recent days, has already telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to request exemption from this year's land tax and to organize emergency relief and price stabilization to alleviate the suffering. The original telegram is as follows: To the esteemed Anhui Provincial Government, we have received repeated appeals from elders and calls from organizations, as well as official documents from local officials. Our Shexian is unfortunate, and the drought demon is rampant. The crops are withered, and the land is cracked. Since autumn, there has not been a single cloud in the sky. The scorching sun hangs high, and the people's hope for a meager harvest of one or two tenths has been dashed. There is a lack of drinking water. People groan under the scorching sun and travel more than ten miles to find a trickle of water to cook and drink. It is foreseeable that people will be emaciated, families will be grieving, and they will be displaced and fill ditches. The association looks towards our hometown with extreme pain. We are deeply concerned and cannot shirk our responsibility. In addition to discussing fundamental relief measures in recent days to assist in the relief efforts, this disaster is particularly severe, and the disaster area is vast. Our hearts are willing, but our strength is limited. A cup of water cannot extinguish a cartload of burning wood. Moreover, at this time of commercial depression and economic collapse, we are struggling to make ends meet, which has always been the case. We are helpless to manage the aftermath. We implore your government to comprehensively review the province's administration, treat the people as if they were your own wounds, and develop a concrete plan for the drought in Shexian to rescue them from fire and water and bring them comfort. We humbly request that you dispatch officials to Shexian as soon as possible to investigate and exempt this year's land tax, and to organize emergency relief and price stabilization, so that both the symptoms and the root causes can be addressed, and the suffering people can catch their breath. We hope you will consider our humble suggestions. Respectfully submitted by the Shexian Compatriots Association in Shanghai.</p>

Resolved: Renovate and move in immediately. The meeting adjourned after discussions.</p>
<h3>False Fire Alarm, a Moment of Panic</h3>
<p>With the arrival of summer, the weather is hot, and the tofu shops in the city work all night. Yesterday (the 28th) at 3 a.m., before dawn, a tofu shop at the intersection of Caishi Street and Dong Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession was boiling soybean milk. There was too much firewood in the stove, causing the chimney to emit fire. Sparks flew everywhere, and the firelight blazed. Neighbors saw it and mistakenly thought it was a fire alarm. They blew whistles wildly and called the fire station, which notified the fire brigade. Many leather belt carts rushed to the scene, about five in total. However, the tofu shop had already extinguished the fire in the chimney. They searched the fire scene everywhere but found nothing. Later, they realized and inspected the tofu shop, but there were no traces of fire. The neighbor who made the phone call claimed that the fire alarm was at the Yonghe grocery store next door to the tofu shop. Therefore, a clerk surnamed Jia from Yonghe store was brought to the police station for verification. The panic subsided, and the incident came to an end. The neighbors nearby were all frightened to no small extent.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Morphine Seized in the Fourth District</h3>
<p>Three Sacks, One Hundred and Twenty Pounds</p>
<p>At 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhang Fenglan, the chief of the Zhongxing Road Police Station in the Fourth District of Zhabei Public Security Bureau, seized Zhu Asi, who was trafficking morphine, and Zhang Xiaosizi, who attempted to seize the poison from Zhu. Zhou Mengshi, a related person, and police officers Ye Rongchun and Pan Shoutang were also brought to the police station. After a brief interrogation, they were sent to the Fourth District along with three sacks of morphine. Zheng Zuhan, a district officer, interrogated Zhu Asi, who confessed that he was 29 years old, from Yangzhou, and worked as a stoker on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. He said that a person surnamed Wang entrusted him to take the morphine to Hangzhou and stopped at the entrance of Zhou Mengshi's cigarette paper shop. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xiaosizi and police officer Ye Rongchun took away the things he was carrying, causing a dispute. He claimed that Pan Shoutang was not involved. Zhang Xiaosizi claimed that he was 20 years old, from Huaian, lived at 1754 Gonghe Xin Road, and also worked as a track worker on the railway. He said that he took Zhu Asi's things to tease him and did not really want to seize his poison. Zhou Mengshi confessed that he was 47 years old, lived at 174 Gonghe Xin Road, and ran a cigarette paper shop. Zhu put the things in front of his shop, and he did not know that Zhang Xiaosizi and Ye Rongchun took the things away. Ye Rongchun confessed that he was 36 years old, from Hebei, and worked as a police officer at the Zhongxing Road Police Station. He said that he did not rob Zhu Asi's things with Zhang Xiaosizi. Pan Shoutang confessed that he was 31 years old, from Shandong, and also worked as a police officer at the Zhongxing Road Police Station. He said that this case had nothing to do with him. After questioning and verifying their confessions, the interrogator found a purchase invoice for morphine from Huachang Company on Zhu Asi. The weight of the poison was measured to be 120 pounds. Due to the severity of the case, it was ordered to prepare a document and escort the five suspects, including Zhu, along with three bags of morphine and the invoice, to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Morning's Dispute on North Sichuan Road: Japanese Hand Over Weapons Seized from Chinese Police, Later Returned to Police Chief</h3>
<p>Police are Thoroughly Investigating</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at about 1 a.m. yesterday (the 27th), a Chinese policeman No. 2302 outside a certain Japanese cafe on North Sichuan Road, saw a car carrying four Japanese people stop nearby. All four Japanese got out of the car. The Chinese policeman suspected that the Chinese driver was soliciting passengers halfway and stepped forward to ask for his license. The driver refused, and a dispute arose. One of the Japanese immediately beat the policeman, and then they fought each other. The policeman, outnumbered, tried to call the police station, but was stopped by two Japanese. So he blew his whistle. Another Chinese policeman heard the sound and came to help, and persuaded the Japanese to go to the police station together. The two Japanese agreed and followed the two policemen for about a hundred yards. Near Yokohama Bridge, one of the Japanese suddenly punched one of the Chinese policemen in the head from behind, knocking him down, and tried to grab his gun. The other Chinese policeman rushed to help his companion and managed to take out the bullets from the gun. The policeman who was hit saw that the Japanese were strong and that fighting would be useless. He slightly released his grip on the gun, and the Japanese snatched it and put it in his pocket. After walking a few steps, the Japanese also snatched the policeman's baton. When they arrived at the Dixwell Road police station, one of the Japanese immediately handed over the weapons to the duty officer and told his side of the story of the dispute in a gentle manner. Another Japanese man was very furious. It is reported that the police station and the Japanese authorities are thoroughly investigating the case.</p>
<h3>10,000+ Bags of Saigon Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>This is Only a Small Batch</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive</p>
<p>The foreign rice that Shanghai rice merchants ordered from Annam has now been shipped to Shanghai one after another. The French mail ship Aramis entered the port the day before yesterday, bringing another 12,700 bags of Saigon rice. The day before yesterday, the port was closed due to Confucius' birthday, and the ship did not open its hatches to unload. The unloading began at the China Merchants Bureau's North Pier yesterday and is temporarily stored in the pier. The customers have not yet claimed the rice. The purchase price of the Saigon rice that arrived in Shanghai this time is 8 Shanghai silver dollars per bag. This batch is only a small batch, and larger quantities of foreign rice are expected to arrive continuously.</p>
<h3>Missing Car Found on Wasteland on Route de Zikawei</h3>
<p>Rear Mudguard Severely Damaged</p>
<p>Police Take Fingerprints, Arrest Suspects</p>
<p>The black-plated car No. 3644 of Huali Automobile Company at 617 Jiujiang Road was suddenly robbed by a young man in a Western suit the day before yesterday.

<h3>Number of Japanese Imports Soars After New Tariff Implemented</h3>
<p>Increased by More Than 2 Million Yuan in July</p>
<p>Sugar and Seafood are Most Prominent</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new import tariff, there has been an impact on China's foreign trade. The situation of trade with Japan this month is of even greater concern to the people of the country. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday specially consulted Wang Boyan, a specialist at the Statistics Department of the International Trade Bureau. According to him, the import value of trade with Japan in July this year was over 9,567,700 yuan, and the export value was over 6,648,000 yuan. Compared with the same period in previous years, imports increased by more than 2 million yuan, while exports decreased by more than 800,000 yuan. Compared with the previous month of this year, imports also increased, while exports decreased significantly (a decrease of more than 1,290,000 yuan). Therefore, in terms of trade balance, the import surplus increased from 1.6 million yuan last month to over 2.91 million yuan. The difference is even greater compared with the same period in previous years. Last year, there was an export surplus of over 250,000 yuan with Japan in July. Although the sharp increase in this month's import surplus is due to the decline in exports, the strong imports of Japanese goods after the implementation of the new tariff are not unrelated. This argument can be strengthened by studying the amount of major Japanese imports. This month,</p>
<p>was discovered at around 4:30 a.m. yesterday in the wasteland near Route de Zikawei. Yue patrolmen discovered it, reported it to the French police station, and notified the Public Concession police station to come and inspect together. It was found that the rear mudguard of the car was severely damaged, and there were no belongings in the car. Fingerprints found in the car were photographed one by one and taken back for file, so as to track down the suspects. The car company was notified to retrieve the original car.</p>
<h3>Serial Robber Executed for Murder in Armed Robbery</h3>

<h3>Japanese Brewery Busted for Drug Production Facility</h3>
<p>Specializing in Manufacturing Heroin, etc.</p>
<p>Five Suspects, Including Yao Fuyuan, Arrested</p>
<p>Li Pengfei, a Chinese detective, and Liu Zhisheng and Wu Shoushan, detectives of the Yulin Road Police Station, learned that someone was manufacturing and selling heroin, morphine, and other drugs for profit in the brewery established by a Japanese man named Nishima at No. 117 Ningguo Road. At 11:45 a.m. the day before yesterday, they obtained a search warrant from the court and went with David Smith, a foreign detective, to arrest five suspects, including Yao Fuyuan and Chen Biao from Fujian, Zheng Jinfa, Li Zike from Anhui, and Wang Shixing, a local acquaintance. Five pounds of heroin and eleven pounds of morphine were seized, along with machinery. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated the previous situation and said that the first defendant, Yao Fuyuan, claimed at the police station that the machinery belonged to the fugitive Japanese man Fukuda, the main culprit. He was introduced to work there by the defendant Chen Biao, with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Chen also assisted. The others were all workers. According to Xima, who owned the two rooms, he rented the house through Xilaimanzi, a compatriot who runs a pharmacy at No. 226 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, for a monthly rent of 1,000 yuan. Both Japanese men have now been arrested. Small samples of heroin and morphine were presented for inspection, and a request was made for an extension of time. The Japanese man Nishima stated that on the 14th of this month, a friend, Xilaimanzi, and the defendant Yao Fuyuan came to rent the house. The rent was 1,000 yuan per month. They said it was for a pharmaceutical factory and that there were five Chinese people in total, the defendants in this case. Xilaimanzi claimed that he knew Yao Fuyuan, so he rented the house for Xima. It is known that the main goods Japan exports to China are sugar, with a value of 3,954,960 gold units. Earthenware, steel, and cotton cloth are next, each with a value of over 300,000 gold units. Other goods in order of value, such as seafood, rubber products, and paper, all reach over 200,000 gold units. The import value of each commodity, compared with the previous month and the same period in previous years, shows an increase for almost all commodities except for cotton cloth, rubber products, and paper, which decreased slightly. The increases in the amount of seafood and sugar are the largest. This seems to be related to the new tariff's</p>
<p>reduction in tax rates (such as the new tariff's significant reduction in the import tax rate for seafood, with the highest reduction being 35% and the lowest being 3.4%). As for goods exported to Japan, all commodities in this month except for meat and ore, such as cotton, cotton yarn, and bones, decreased compared with the previous month and the same period in previous years. Looking at the half-monthly trade with Japan, exports are extremely weak, while imports seem to be on the rise. The increasing trend of seafood imports is particularly damaging to the domestic fishing industry. It is hoped that the people of the country will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>pharmaceutical use, and he did not know Fukuda. Yao Fuyuan confessed that he was friends with Chen Biao and denied going to rent the house, but only helped out inside, with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Fukuda was the manager, and he hired Lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. Chen Biao confessed that he knew Fukuda in his hometown. Fukuda owed him 6,000 silver dollars. Fukuda said he would first return 2,000 yuan to him as capital, and he would help with mixing medicine, etc., with a monthly salary of 20 yuan. Everything was managed by Fukuda. The three defendants, Zheng, Li, and Wang, all claimed to be workers inside, with a monthly wage of 15 yuan. The rest of the confessions were vague. Judge Liu Yugui ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>

Her father, Liu Genfu, was a sea cucumber vendor in Xiaocaiwu, Hongkou. The night before, the girl gathered a few female friends, including Zhang Zhiyue, and snuck out to watch the Taoist rituals nearby. She only returned home at around 5 a.m. the next morning. Her father found out and scolded her for being so promiscuous. Unexpectedly, after being scolded, the girl felt resentful and developed a world-weary thought. She secretly swallowed poison and committed suicide. Her maid, Mei Fan, saw it and immediately told the girl's father. They took her to Shanghai Nursing Home, but the poison had already entered her lungs, and there was no way to save her. She died soon after. The hospital reported it to the Jiaxing Road police station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then carried to the Filun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, a prosecutor, Mr. Tang, from the First Special Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body.

<p>Dancer and Actress's Behavior Too Immoral</p>
<p>Cook Repeatedly Advises, But Is Wrongly Blamed</p>
<p>Bai Meifang, a Hunan woman who worked as a dancer and actress, lived at No. 35 Chengping Lane, Route Kaufmann. Her cook, Li Dongcai, 28 years old, who was also from Hunan, was scheduled to be dismissed by Bai on the 15th of this month.

His intestines immediately spilled out, blood gushed out, and he fainted to the ground. After being seen, the New Gate police station was reported. The foreign inspector Clekai and Chinese detective Yang Youshan were ordered to investigate. Li was taken to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died of his injuries the day before yesterday. Bai Meifang was young and beautiful and good at socializing, so many dance customers were happy to interact with her. Although Li was a servant, he was quite loyal. Seeing his mistress having so many boyfriends did not sit well with him, so he often gave her advice. Bai was angry at this and planned to dismiss him. Li thought that his loyal advice had fallen on deaf ears and that he would have difficulty finding work once he was dismissed. Therefore, he had thoughts of suicide. The detectives carried Li's body to the Filun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, a prosecutor, Mr. Tang, from the First Special Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Inspector Clekai first reported the above situation. Later, Xia Kong, 58 years old, stated that Bai Meifang was her goddaughter and that she lived in her house. The deceased was her hired cook, who was extremely loyal. He was not happy with her daughter's many boyfriends, saying that although she was young now, she would eventually grow old and should choose a good husband. He was too afraid to advise her himself, so he often asked her to speak on his behalf. Her daughter planned to dismiss him that day, and he suddenly committed suicide. Her daughter was unable to come due to illness, so she asked her to come and claim the body. After hearing the statements, Mr. Tang ruled that the deceased, Li Dongcai, was male and had died from a stab wound to the abdomen. As there were no other relatives, the body was handed over to Xia Kong to sign for and prepare for the coffin.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Open on September 1st</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition of the Jiangsu Provincial Capital, organized by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association in Zhenjiang, has been ongoing since its opening on the 1st of this month. Originally scheduled for three weeks, it was extended by five days due to excellent results and the strong requests from various sectors of the provincial capital. It officially closed on the 26th. Regarding the association's response to the request from various sectors of Yangzhou to relocate the Zhenjiang exhibition to Yangzhou and continue it as a national exhibition, preparations have been underway separately and should be completed within this short period. According to a statement released by Liu Zhongying, a standing committee member of the association, excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>General Overview of the Zhenjiang Exhibition: According to the statement, the association's leadership of member factories to Zhenjiang to hold the provincial capital national exhibition was originally entrusted by the party and government authorities of Jiangsu Province. In addition to the association overseeing all publicity plans for participating manufacturers and various equipment and regulations within the exhibition venue, matters such as fire prevention, sanitation, military police, and protection were all the responsibility of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau, instructed by the Jiangsu Provincial Party and Government Authorities, with mutual supervision, all achieving discipline. All manufacturers' staff entering and leaving the venue early and late wore membership cards of the association, so order was maintained in a systematic and orderly manner. The scale of the exhibition set an unprecedented example for any exhibition in the provincial capital. The public's enthusiasm for using national products was also quite strong, especially among officials from various agencies and students from various schools. Because they usually have no opportunity to recognize national products, they all have a sincere belief in supporting national products during this exhibition. The national exhibition closed on the 26th of this month after the conference representatives decided to extend the exhibition. According to a letter from the association's temporary office in Zhenjiang, the total business volume from the opening to the closing of the national exhibition amounted to more than 215,400 yuan.</p>

He was escorted to the Second Special Court, where he was sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of 500 yuan. Subsequently, the French Concession Police found that Shi was related to the assassination of Shao Wenbin, the flower association king. Therefore, he was escorted to the court, and it was instructed to reschedule for further verification of the situation. The previous report has been recorded. He was interrogated again yesterday. First, witness Zhang Bingrong was called to testify, 33 years old, a citizen who previously worked as a tea room attendant at Cao A-wu's house. He heard Cao A-wu, Shi Laohu, Yao Liansheng, Lu Laoqi, Li Landi, etc. discussing a plan to assassinate Shao Wenbin at Cao's house at No. 2 Dexing Lane. However, the Shi Laohu seen at that time was short, with a dark face and protruding teeth. Later, he heard Chen Changgen say to me that the person who instigated the killing of Shao was Shi Laohu, etc. It was not the Shi Laohu in this case. However, the citizen was also arrested for the relationship between killing Shao Wenbin and was sentenced to life imprisonment after the conclusion of the second instance. The real situation is unjust. Shi A-quan confessed that the citizen was not Shi Laohu and did not know Cao A-wu, Lu Laoqi, Li Landi, etc. The citizen used to do board business and was only punished for occasionally guarding the flower association. He did not dare to commit murder and asked for clarification. Zhu Dianqing, a lawyer, defended him. According to Zhou Shaoguang, a detective from the French Concession Police, Zhang Bingrong also said during the confrontation with Shi A-quan at the police station that he did not know Shi, etc. Judge Li Changnian instructed the defendants to be detained and wait for further investigation before continuing the interrogation.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Missing, Master Puts Off, Escapes Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Family Members Deal with It</p>
<p>Lou Lianchao from Zhuji was a farmer in his hometown and only had one son named Youmu, who is now nineteen years old. When he was fourteen years old, Lou Cancai, a fellow clan member who worked as a tailor in Shanghai, brought Youmu to Shanghai to learn Red Gang tailoring. It has been five years since then, and there has been no news. Lou Lianchao did not want his beloved son to leave his side, but was forced by livelihood and reluctantly let him come to Shanghai to learn the craft. At that time, it was stated that he could go home after three years of apprenticeship. When the deadline was approaching, Lou Cancai kept delaying it until now, five years have passed. Lou Lianchao was eager to see his son, so he bought a boat to Shanghai the day before yesterday and found Lou Cancai in Zhabei. He questioned him about the whereabouts of his beloved son, but Lou Cancai replied that Youmu had escaped without a trace in September last year. Lou Lianchao was shocked to hear this and asked why he did not notify him at that time, so that he could search for him. He then reported to the police and detained Lou Cancai in the Fifth District Second Precinct. According to Lou Lianchao's firm statement, his beloved son Lou Youmu was killed by Lou Cancai and his body was nowhere to be found. He demanded a thorough investigation. Lou Cancai's confession was evasive. Yesterday, he prepared a document to send the original defendant to the local court for questioning.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of Yu Ruitang, who claims that he recently read a news item in the Shen Shi Chen San Bao reporting a fight between me and Zhu Boxiang, which is inconsistent with the facts. The circumstances are as follows: On the morning of August 23rd at 9:00 AM, I passed by the Jiaotong Road intersection and saw Zhu Boxiang arguing with Zhang Qing in front of the Yonggu Hardware Manufacturing Factory. I stopped to mediate and no conflict occurred. Afterwards, I returned to the Gongda Silk Factory. Unexpectedly, Zhu Boxiang harbored a grudge and falsely accused me and Wang Azhong of assault at the Fourth District Police Station. After investigation, the police station released us as innocent. On the 25th, Zhu Boxiang's daughter-in-law had a miscarriage and he again falsely accused us, but we were granted bail after interrogation. According to Zhu Boxiang, he argued with someone on Jiaotong Road on the 23rd, and his daughter-in-law was at home, a distance away. How could she have been injured? I work at the Gongda Factory every day and have not fled. I request that your lawyer inform the newspaper to make a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Zhou Lianze, Lawyer.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Strive</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I saw your article "Private Life and Ideals," which made me question my own private life. Now, I will tentatively review a part of my private life. Although this is personal, at least many people suffer from the same problem. If this problem becomes common, it is necessary to seek guidance.</p>
<p>"A person who only holds a noble ideal is just dreaming. You have to strive for this goal, and this ideal will become truly your own and can become a reality." It seems too simplistic to encompass everything in a great work with just the two words "strive," and it is not very helpful for people to understand. Moreover, the methods and processes of striving are not explained and guided in more detail, which makes people doubt that the word "strive" is just a comforting word, like stuffing a piece of candy in the mouth of a crying child. In reality, it is still empty, and at best, it is just a crown for the successful!</p>
<p>In the course of life, the environment greatly influences people's thoughts, both forward and backward. In terms of methods, how should we overcome the moment when a raging wave crashes into a dangerous dam? Here, I will give three common examples:</p>
<p>(1) Sexual Frustration - A young person needs a certain amount of sexual comfort at an appropriate age, and of course, this is not limited to sexual intercourse. But in a deeply feudal social system, can young people have proper solutions? I don't believe that a young person can smoothly pass through life without needing sex or without proper comfort. At this time, they may go astray, or they may not dare to go down the wrong path and try to overcome emotions with reason. At this time, besides feeling dull all day long like a fool, there is no other good way to comfort themselves, unless they let the climax naturally subside.</p>
<p>(2) The Way Out of Life - Obviously, the biggest call in society is survival, so people compete with nature and beasts for survival. Even the struggle between people is for survival. This is originally like a track. Now, we don't have food to eat, or we feel that we are about to run out of food. At this time, shouldn't we stand up and fight for it? True, society is a whole. If one person doesn't have food to eat, it's definitely not just that one person doesn't have food to eat. There are many people who are about to starve to death, and there are even more elsewhere! Studying natural sciences and social sciences does not lead to a way out. Of course, people won't wait to die. At this time, besides searching for food like a tiger, they won't think about other things. If he is a person who wants to make a living for the masses, he knows that great future work awaits him to fill himself with knowledge and learning to do his best! I don't know what he should do first?</p>
<p>(3) Stimulating Nerves - This refers to the stimulation of different senses, which makes him uneasy about his work. A person committed suicide because of economic oppression; several young people under the age of twenty were shot for some reason... Thousands of miles of land were lost, Japanese soldiers were practicing, and foreigners slapped Chinese people for no reason... What kind of stimulation do these news give people? Will people who have been stimulated calmly turn a blind eye and a deaf ear?</p>
<p>Combining the above three, the biggest frustration for young people is created, which not only hinders their progress, but also erodes their will. True, those who can overcome are successful, otherwise they are failures, and maybe they will fall: Yes, overcoming, striving, are all absolutely good-sounding nouns, I don't know how to use them properly.</p>
<p>My private life is also an example. I feel dissatisfied with reality, and I also smell the bloody filth! I demand my own satisfaction, which is to demand the satisfaction of the masses first. If the masses are not satisfied, naturally, I will not have any hope of satisfaction. I want to squeeze into the ranks of the masses' lives, and I must first temper my own muscles and bones and train my own knowledge. I never want to seek a means of living from my professional skills. So I first seek literature, followed by social science, and exercise my body and mind. However, the so-called push of the environment cannot be safely in the whirlpool without being moved. When I have sexual desires, I dare not fall, so I sit in silence all day, and when I am stimulated by external factors, I don't eat or sleep for a day. This is to avoid the important and take the light, for the sake of concentrating on the learning that I want. But, what about the oppression of life? At first, I didn't think about it, but as it squeezed in day by day, I began to become a starving ghost. I had to give up literature or social science and concentrate on seeking skills to make a living. Is this also a failure of striving? I am confident that I have strength and age, and I am still eager to learn! It won't be too late to do it again at thirty-four, fifty, or even sixty! I understand all this very well, but I still cannot overcome the youthful frustration that rises and falls like waves. The blow and hindrance it gives me are even greater. What should I do to strive? Zhang Lijun.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: A Ghost Carries a Carload of Travelers from Guanzhong, a Poor Family Crosses the River, Lamenting a Qin Person</p>
<p>Li Shilian was being clever, which was really annoying: he was again flattering the foreign devils. However, since he had benefited from their convenient car, he felt embarrassed to refute him. So he turned his face to Zhang Jiefu and said, "This place is naturally the crucial route to Xi'an. All goods coming from the east, as long as they are transported by car, I think there is no way to avoid this place. If we set up a bureau to collect landing taxes at this bridge, it would definitely be a good source of income." Zhang Jiefu smiled and said, "In that case, after you get to the provincial capital, submit a memorial to the chairman." Li Shilian didn't know if he was being serious or joking. He had no choice but to respond with a smile. As a result, everyone felt speechless and remained silent for a few minutes. The two Germans measured for a while, and the bridge workers also returned. Instead of returning to their seats, they took out two glass cups and two bottles of beer from their hand basket. They also had clips for opening beer bottles. With a "pop" sound, they pulled out the corks. The two leaned against the car door, each holding a glass cup, and turned the bottle mouths upside down, pouring beer into the cups with a clanging sound. White foam surged up, and the smell of beer drifted in the wind. Zhang Jiefu couldn't bear to watch and turned his face away, looking into the Ba River. He thought to himself, "When I get to Xi'an today, I won't bother with anything else. I'll just buy two bottles of beer and drink them first." Thinking this, he swallowed two mouthfuls of saliva. With great difficulty, the two Germans satisfied their beer cravings, and then the car continued to move forward. In the distance, on the great plain, there was a black circle of shadows rising from the ground, which was the city of Chang'an. As they continued to move forward, two tall black shadows appeared in the air, which were the arrow towers on the city wall. Li Shilian said, "Judging from this, Chang'an City is probably not too bad." Zhang Jiefu said, "Regardless of whether it's bad or not, a place without electric lights is probably not much better." Li Shilian said, "When I got to Tongguan, I regretted coming. But since we're here, if we go back immediately, people won't say we're afraid of hardship, but they'll say we can't find anything to do." (7)</p>
<h3>Why is Manshu Lovable?</h3>
<p>— Fu Fan</p>
<p>In the modern Chinese literary history, Su Manshu is truly a poet loved by everyone. The new literature of today also cherishes and admires him quite a bit: he was originally just an old writer of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School: Even if his poetic talent is pure and moving, he shouldn't occupy such an important page, but why is he receiving such grand respect from so many people? This naturally has its reasons.</p>
<p>Su Manshu's novels are written very well, but they cannot be called a great accomplishment. His wisdom naturally created his literary career, especially his unfortunate encounters. From the bitter tears, he obtained poetic themes and the most wonderful artistic conception. "Cleverness" is probably common to young people, but the lovable Manshu is not only clever. His success in Sanskrit classics and the foundation of his English studies were all obtained through his own hard work.</p>
<p>What is especially lovable is his romantic temperament: it seems that someone asked Mr. Sun Yat-sen if there were any people he admired. Mr. Sun said, "I admire two monks, one is Su Manshu, and the other is Master Taixu." Later, that person asked him who was more pure, and Mr. Sun said, "I love Su Manshu's tranquility." When Mr. Sun took office as the Provisional President, who with a bit of historical connection didn't go to find him? Only our world-weary and ill-fated poet, Mr. Sun could not find him even after searching everywhere. Manshu's solitary appreciation of himself can truly be considered a pure poet.</p>
<p>The world is turbulent, and there are many scholars! But how many have integrity? How many are thorough supermen?</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Tao Jue)</p>
<p>The most soul-stirring night in life is the first night after a long separation. A reunion after a long absence feels especially intimate, far surpassing a new marriage. Those who have not experienced it can hardly express one ten-thousandth of it.</p>
<p>A Qing poet said, "Smilingly using red sleeves to cover the silver candle, not letting the talented man read books at night." If you don't read books, what else is there to do? A smile.</p>
<h3>Water Chestnut</h3>
<p>— Xi Tongchu</p>
<p>A gust of light wind lifted the river water two or three points high, and all the round water chestnut leaves were rising and falling, moving and swaying. The long stems connected directly to the bottom of the river were covered with aquatic animals. Sometimes a few snails would cling to them, pulling the leaves into the water. In the center of the river, among the green leaves, several withered old leaves had fallen. Some were purple, some were gray, and some were yellow. Probably the water chestnuts were ripe.</p>
<p>Several younger brothers urged me to pick water chestnuts.</p>
<p>The water chestnut boat was properly prepared. It was a large bathtub, large enough for two people, and it slid down from the stone slabs of the water bridge. Duan brother turned around and said, "Do you dare to go down?" Ha... A burst of laughter. Sixth brother sat down in the tub to demonstrate, moving forward and backward, with only his two hands casually paddling. "Brother Heng! When you want to go left, paddle with your right hand, and when you want to go right, use your left hand. Sit behind a bit, so that there is room in front to place the water chestnuts." Saying this, he paddled again. So they held onto the edge of the tub and helped me down. They stood on the water bridge, watched my panicked expression, and laughed.</p>
<p>I was confused and worried that the tub wouldn't be able to carry my weight. If I fell, the water chestnut stems would entangle my hands and feet, and that wouldn't be fun. But they kept encouraging me: "Be brave! Be brave! It's okay, it's okay." I didn't dare to turn my head to the side.</p>
<p>I saw the emerald green small leaves. Leaning my shoulder, I passed by in the tub, and the tub was stable. My courage increased a lot, so I also wanted to turn and circle around.</p>
<p>Two dragonflies landed on my little boat in pairs. I scooped up some water and splashed it at them, but they still raised their tails and stayed there. Dragonflies! Are you so sure that there is no one in the water who will harm you? Your fate is really unfortunate! I reached out and grabbed one of them.</p>
<p>A noisy sound arose from the shore: "Give it to me!" "Brother Heng, give it to me!" "I helped you hold the tub, give it to me"...</p>
<h3>Desperate Progress</h3>
<h3>Records of the Ethereal Fragrance of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The dinner we had at Fengtai Station was also very significant. The first reason, of course, was that this meal was the first meal after getting on the train, and dinner was usually one of the two daily "grand meals": so a hundred bowls of main dishes were sent up as usual in the palace. These dishes were all packed in wooden boxes. If it were on an ordinary train, the doors would definitely be too small to allow these huge food boxes to pass through: fortunately, the doors of our imperial train had all been remodeled and were almost twice as large as ordinary doors. So every time it was time for a meal, dozens of eunuchs would line up on the platform outside, starting from the two cars representing the imperial kitchen and extending to the Empress Dowager's car: all the food boxes filled with various delicacies from the mountains and seas were passed down one by one from the first eunuch, just like the wooden stick game that elementary school students play. It took about four or five minutes to pass it to the eunuch standing closest to the Empress Dowager's dining table, who was usually Zhang De, who would then take the dishes out of the box and place them on the table. The outside of these boxes was painted with a bright yellow paint like gold, and the bowls and dishes inside the boxes were all very beautiful porcelain: at the same time, the eunuchs who passed the food boxes were also wearing colorful uniforms, so just the scene of serving the dishes was very beautiful and moving! Unfortunately, apart from those annoyingly foolish officials, others could not hope to see such a good show.</p>
<p>After our first dinner was over, the Empress Dowager ordered the train to depart: so we continued to be carried by this yellow train, slowly heading towards Tianjin. (116)</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of the Watermelon Peel</h3>
<p>— Wei Ji</p>
<p>Watermelon is truly cheap and good among the refreshing drinks, so it is the best refreshment for middle-class families.</p>
<p>Our Chinese people are the least hygienic. After eating watermelons, they throw the rinds on the street, making the streets full of flies.</p>
<p>Recently, a tragedy about watermelon rinds happened in my hometown. Now I will write this down:</p>
<p>In our village, there lived a family of only a mother and son. The son lived by catching fish. He lost his father in his childhood and was raised by his mother. The mother was over sixty years old, so he was very filial to his mother.</p>
<p>This summer, his mother caught a cold at night and became ill. He asked a doctor to come and write a prescription. Then he went to town to get the medicine.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on his way back with the medicine, he slipped on a watermelon rind in front of a house. His head hit the stone steps of the house, and his head was bleeding.</p>
<p>After a few days, he died of his injuries, and his mother hanged herself.</p>
<p>In an instant, a mother and son were killed by a piece of watermelon rind.</p>
<p>So I advise everyone, after eating watermelons, do not throw the rinds on the street.</p>
<p>And eating watermelon rind pickled is also very delicious.</p>
<p>Rambling Talk</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Suzhou Stories</h3>
<p>— Smoke Bridge</p>
<p>Qianlong Was an Archaeologist. To the west of Suzhou, there is a large market town called Hushu Pass, famous far and wide for its mat production. The provincial women's sericulture school there has excellent results, greatly influencing the new silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, the reputation of Hushu Pass is even higher. However, almost no one who takes the train through Hushu Pass pronounces the character "浒" as "hu," even the people of Suzhou. According to dictionaries, it should be read like the character "虎" (tiger). The most obvious example is in the Book of Documents, "leading the western Shu River," and Shi Nai'an's "Water Margin," who would call it "Water Xu Margin"? According to Suzhou legend, when Emperor Qianlong went to Jiangnan, he traveled from Wuxi to Hushu Pass. The old emperor asked what this place was. The officials reported. The old emperor asked how it was written. The official wrote it for him to see. He only recognized two-thirds of the character "浒," recognizing it as the character "许" (Xu). Because it came from the Emperor's mouth, it spread. The common people could only secretly laugh at him for misreading characters."</p>
<p>However, the "Records of Wu" state: "When Emperor Qin Shi Huang was inspecting the sea, he passed by the tomb of Helu and wanted to take his precious sword. Suddenly, a white tiger sat on the tomb. Emperor Qin tried to strike it with his sword, but missed and hit a stone. The tiger ran twenty-five miles west and disappeared, the ground splitting into a pool, hence the name 'Tiger Qiu'. During the Tang Dynasty, due to the taboo of the character '虎' (tiger), and the taboo of the character '鏐' (Liu) in the name of Qian Liu, the name was changed to 'Xu City'. Later generations corrupted the old sound, adding the water radical to '许' (Xu) to create '浒', and changed '市' (city) to '墅' (village)." So the name Hushu Pass was also mistakenly added and attached later. Examining its original name, it should be called Xu City Pass. This old man Qianlong was actually an archaeologist and cannot be said to have "misread characters."</p>
<p>There is a common saying in Suzhou: "Second Miss Guan Shang (pronounced as lang)." It means that this person is a bit "carefree." I asked the people of Guan Shang, but they couldn't tell me its origin. The honorable surname and given name of this Second Miss are also impossible to verify. But the people of Suzhou are used to saying this phrase. People from other places will definitely be confused.</p>
<h3>Feng Menglong's Humor</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese scholar On Yano brought the "Three Words" to light from a pile of waste paper, Feng Menglong has been frequently mentioned. Rong Zhaozu wrote an article in the Lingnan Journal, "The Life and Works of Feng Menglong of the Ming Dynasty," which has clearly outlined Feng's profile. Because he liked to critique novels, organize novels, and write novels, many humorous things have been passed down to the present.</p>
<p>He was a native of Suzhou, and the people of Suzhou excel at telling witty jokes. The style of writing playful articles has been the norm since ancient times and is even more prevalent today. Feng once wrote a riddle about a cotton flail: "A thing is several inches long, with a round head and a thin neck and no hair. A beautiful woman grabs it in her hand at first sight, lifts her skirt and plays with it. They enjoy each other on the mat without resentment. The sound is like a plump and lovely body. It all looks like flowers before your eyes, until a pregnancy results." This poem is very obscene on the surface, but in essence, it describes the cotton flail in a truly hilarious way.</p>
<p>There is also a song mocking a senior prostitute, "Yellow Oriole": "Looking up at her enchanting face, she comes out of the boudoir, and must bend her waist. Half of her flowery face is exposed against the powdered wall. It's not a cloud-like high bun, it's not embroidered shoes with high soles, she bows like a broken bamboo falling in the wind. How beautiful, beside the Taihu stone is a female Cao Jiao." Literary scholars are naturally frivolous, but when it comes to the most exquisite point, it makes people not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>"Jiao Chuang Xianhua" records: He made fun of someone who got a position through connections, saying, "Confucius ran out of food in Chen, and ordered Yan Hui to go to the Huihui country to borrow food. The Huihui country refused. He then ordered Zigon to go, saying that Confucius had said, 'How dare I, Si, expect anything from the Huihui?' So I am very respectful to your country." The Huihui country was overjoyed and sent him a load of white grain. Zigon returned and told Confucius. Confucius frowned and said, "I have cheated a load of grain, but unfortunately, the logic doesn't make sense." It was a very scathing remark.</p>
<p>Feng's works are numerous. The "Three Sounds" are not easy to find, so just read "Stories Old and New." Like the hilarious play "Prefect Qiao Makes a Mess of the Mandarin Duck Register," which is the same as the Peking Opera "Fan Wang Palace," how could it be written without a humorous writer? Perhaps it was a fact at the time, already widely known in society, but only a genius for humor can pick up fragments of humor in life and write humorous works.</p>
<p>"Biography of Dongfang Shuo in the Book of Han": "Later lovers of good things attached strange words and bizarre language to Shuo." It can be seen that Feng's humor is not limited to this, and some humor does not entirely belong to him.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Recruits Students to Study Mechanical Engineering in Europe</h3>
<p>Quota of Twenty-Five Students</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 28th) The Ministry of Education is recruiting twenty-five publicly funded students to study mechanical engineering in Europe. Male graduates of public and registered private industrial vocational schools and above, aged between twenty and twenty-five, can submit their graduation certificates and four recent bareheaded half-length photos (four inches) to the Ministry of Education from today until September 12 for examination. Examination items: (1) Physical examination; (2) Academic examination (only those who pass the physical examination can participate). Subjects include Party Principles, Chemistry, Applied Mechanics, Mechanical Engineering, Advanced Mathematics, Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Drafting (Mechanical Drawing), Foreign Languages (English, French, German, Italian, choose one). The Ministry has issued a notice on the 28th. For detailed information, applicants can inquire at the registration office of the Ministry.</p>
<h3>The Candidate for Director of the National Academic Work Advisory Office Has Been Internally Determined</h3>
<p>The motivation for establishing the National Academic Work Advisory Office was prepared during the previous visit to China by Mr. Morellet, Deputy Director of the International Labor Bureau. When Mr. Morellet arrived, the Ministry of Education sent a certain commissioner who had recently returned from Europe after inspecting education and had a long-standing relationship with Mr. Morellet to accompany him to visit and lecture in various places. Mr. Morellet also spent several days at the Ministry of Education discussing Chinese education with colleagues from higher, general, and social education, and exchanging opinions with each other, especially discussing higher education. Therefore, in order to promote communication with foreign academia and investigate and introduce national academia, China believes that the establishment of the National Academic Work Advisory Office is imperative. At that time, taking advantage of Mr. Morellet's presence in China, referring to the established rules of similar advisory offices in Europe and the United States, several principles for establishing the National Academic Work Advisory Office in China were drafted. Since the Minister of Education proposed and passed the establishment of the National Academic Work Advisory Office, although there were many candidates vying for the position of director, both the Ministry and the Committee, based on the recommendation of a certain veteran of the Party and the State, and emphasizing the liaison between Mr. Racheman, the technical cooperation officer of the League of Nations, and Mr. Morellet, the Deputy Director of the International Labor Bureau, considering the convenience of future international academic communication and the suitability of personnel, both parties agreed to internally appoint a certain gentleman (currently not officially announced, so it is inconvenient to write out) as the director. The organizational regulations of the office have been sent by the Ministry of Education to the National Economic Committee. The Ministry of Education wants to establish the office as soon as possible and has obtained the approval of the National Economic Committee. Minister Wang Xueting, after returning to Beijing from Jiangxi, can prepare for the establishment. If it is not possible by the end of August, it will be at the latest in September. The office's expenses are 3,000 yuan per month, and the director's salary is 500 yuan. The office will be located within the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Record of the 11th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society (1)</h3>
<p>Members from All Over the Country Gathered in Changsha on the 25th</p>
<p>Wounds and Scars from the Drought Seen Everywhere Along the Way</p>
<p>Changsha Special Dispatch: The 11th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society is being held in Changsha this year. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency accompanied the group to Hunan to record the news and visit Mr. He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, to inquire about his hand-drafted "Three-Year Plan for Hunan Province" and preliminary construction. The impressions along the way, the grand occasion of the economic annual meeting, and the recent situation in Hunan Province will be recorded in succession below.</p>
<h3>(1) On the Way to Hunan</h3>
<p>The economic annual meeting will be held at Hunan University in Changsha on August 26. It takes four or five days to reach Changsha from Shanghai. The reporter took the Jiangshun Wheel of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was going upstream on the 21st, to set sail. Boarding the ship at 10 p.m. on the 20th, I met Mr. Li Quanshi, Mr. Tang Qingzeng, and Mr. Zhuang Zhihuan, who were traveling to Hunan together. Later, I saw Mr. Xu Xinliu, Mr. Pan Xulun, and Mr. Hu Zhuangyou. Shanghai members such as Li Zhaohuan, Ma Chonggan, and Wang Weiyin all temporarily failed to make the trip due to various reasons. After the cabin was arranged, the reporter shared a room with Mr. Hu Zhuangyou. Fortunately, the journey was not lonely. At about 4 o'clock, the ship left Shanghai. During the day, I met Mr. Liu Hongsheng, the manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and discussed the</p>
<p>status of Yangtze River navigation in detail. Currently, six companies operate the largest businesses on the Yangtze River route. The Chinese companies are China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei, and Ningshao. The foreign companies are Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin. The newly emerging Minsheng Company has considerable influence on the river routes in Yichang and Chongqing in Sichuan. In addition, there are also Jiejiang Company, Xiangtai Company, Mobil, Asia Petroleum, Near Seas Mail Steamship Company, Mitsui &amp; Co., etc. In short, due to frequent domestic disasters and the bankruptcy of the rural economy in our country in recent years, the business situation of these ten companies has also declined. The business performance of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the first half of the year was not bad, but it could only maintain the status quo due to the heavy monthly interest payments. Now, it has added four near-sea vessels and 500-ton shallow-water vessels, but due to financial constraints, it is difficult to increase the number of vessels for the time being. As for the combined water and land transportation between Wuhan and Changsha, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is unwilling to organize it for the time being because the freight on this route is not very congested. However, Sanbei Company is working hard on this route. Regarding the transportation of goods downstream on the Yangtze River, Sanbei mainly loads rice and rapeseed from Hunan and Anhui, and trade accounts for the first place. Currently, Hunan and Anhui have announced a ban on the export of rice due to the drought, so Sanbei's freight volume has suddenly decreased sharply. In the past, eight ships traveled back and forth, but now two have been removed. However, it still occupies a dominant position on the upper river. Ningshao now only has two old ships, Ningshao and Ningjing, and its business is negligible and can only sustain itself. Among the foreign steamships, Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are the most powerful British companies on the Yangtze River. In recent years, due to the economic downturn in our country's society, although these two companies have more than 40 ships, more than 10 have been berthed in Shanghai recently. The business is sluggish, and the losses are huge, but they are still strong rivals to our merchant ships. The sharp drop in freight rates is one example. Before the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, Nissin Company could make a net profit of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per year on the Yangtze River route in China. This year, its business revenue in the first half of the year was only 150,000 yuan. It can be seen from this that its decline. Therefore, the 21 Yangtze River ships that were sometimes fully dispatched in the past have now reduced the number of voyages by nine, and six or seven are actually docked in Shanghai. Now, the freight rate has fallen sharply, even lower than that of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson. Driven by patriotism, although the price of passenger tickets and freight is so cheap, fortunately, no one is interested. In addition to this, the aforementioned Jiejiang is an American company that specializes in the upper reaches of Yichang and Chongqing. Xiangtai, Mobil, and Asia Petroleum mainly transport their own goods. Near Seas and Mitsui are Japanese companies. They come fully loaded with inferior goods and mostly carry miscellaneous grains when they leave. In addition, the public security on the Yangtze River is under the charge of special personnel in each province. At the same time, important commercial ports along the coast have warships stationed for defense. However, in the upper reaches of Yichang and Chongqing, a very small number of bandits are sometimes found. The authorities are now paying attention to this. On the morning of the 22nd, we arrived in the capital. Mr. Hu Zhuangyou had a slight fever and went ashore for medical treatment. Mr. Xu Zhaosun, Secretary of the Legislative Yuan, boarded the ship in Nanjing. The ship docked at Xiaguan for about five hours before setting sail upstream. After the ship had traveled for dozens of miles, three deserters jumped into the river and escaped. The commanding officer did not know what to do. When the ship arrived in Wuhu, the sun had already set. Asking the servants, I learned that it would take one or two hours to stop and unload the goods. I went ashore to borrow a telephone at the customs to call my old friends Gao Haoran and Pang Yongyi, and learned</p>
<p>a general overview of the recent situation of the Wuhu rice market. The Wuhu rice market has always been the largest in the country. The Wanshan Mountains in northern Anhui and the Huangshan Mountains in southern Anhui are both fertile alluvial layers, which are the most fertile areas in the province. Therefore, the Qingyi River basin in the south and the surrounding areas of Chaohu Lake are particularly rich in rice production. Even in the financial circles of Wuhu, most of the money houses operate with the rice market as the center. The rice market tax alone brings in about tens of thousands of dollars per month. In the past, there was also a rice donation, but it has now been exempted after the efforts of various sectors and rice merchants. However, Wuhu has no rice to speak of this year because the entire province is experiencing a severe drought. Rice and grain have been declared prohibited from export. At the same time, all rice-producing counties and regions have also banned exports. Therefore, although the new grains have been harvested and the rice market is due, it is still as quiet as usual. In terms of the current selling price, because of the ban on exports, the price in the middle of the month was close to eight or nine yuan per dan, but it has now fallen back to between seven yuan and seven jiao and eight yuan per dan (the above dan refers to the new system of weights and measures, with each dan increasing by one dou, equivalent to the old dan measurement). Therefore, the Guangchao merchants who purchase and transport rice in Wuhu are now hesitating and watching. That night, we passed Datong. On the morning of the 23rd, we arrived in Anqing and stopped briefly before continuing upstream. At about 2 p.m., we passed Madang and Xiaogushan. The water level of the river dropped. Judging from the watermarks at the foot of Xiaogushan Mountain, the water had dropped by about a foot. Also, because it had not rained for a long time, the mountain bamboo was haggard, and the rugged yellow and black rocks were almost indistinguishable. At 8 p.m., the ship gradually approached Jiujiang. Leaning on the railing, I looked at Mount Lu under the moon. Only its outline could be seen in the grayish-white mist. The twinkling stars in the slightly concave area on the left side of the mountain were the electric lights of Guling. At 8:30 p.m., the ship arrived at the pier. The reporter wanted to know</p>
<p>the recent situation of Jiujiang's porcelain trade, and took advantage of the two-hour stopover to go ashore for a quick tour of the streets of Jiujiang, and had brief talks and investigations with various porcelain merchants, so I learned that there were 72 porcelain operators in Jiujiang. Among these 72 companies, there are two types: Zheng Zihao and Fine Goods Shops. There are a total of 57 Zheng Zihao companies and 15 Fine Goods Shops. The so-called Zheng Zihao refers to companies that specialize in wholesale and retail of coarse goods and daily-use fine goods such as bowls and dishes. Fine Goods Shops refers to shops that specialize in retail of daily-use bowls, dishes, fine porcelain goods, and antiques. There are currently about 1,500 shop assistants. In addition, if you include painters and miscellaneous workers, there are more than 2,000 people who rely on this industry to make a living. They rely on the organization of the Porcelain Industry Association, but in reality, it is not used for anything. As for the recent situation of porcelain sales, large quantities are still exported in Jingdezhen. Although Jiujiang also has some wholesale, the amount is very small. Currently, Jiujiang's annual turnover is about 3 million. This year, due to the Lushan Military Officer Training Corps, there are more passing guests, and the retail sales of fine porcelain are better than in previous years. The previous porcelain donation has been exempted, and only the business tax is included, etc. The municipal construction of Jiujiang is along the river. The Shuiding Road is flat and clean, but due to time constraints, I could not go far. According to local people, only this road has been newly built and is slightly cleaner. Other places are still under construction. At 10 o'clock, the reporter returned to the ship and learned that Mr. Ma Yinchu, President of the Economic Society, Gan Naikang, and his wife and son had boarded the ship from Xun. At 10:30 p.m. that night, the ship continued west until 3 p.m. on the 24th, when it arrived in Hankou. At that time, there were about 50 members who came with this trip, as well as members who came to Hankou the day before and local members from Hankou. Due to the large number of people, they had to be divided into two groups.</p>
<p>depart Hankou for Hunan. The first group decided on the ship to take the night train to Changsha that evening, consisting of 26 people, including the reporter. The second group to Changsha was instructed by the Hankou reception office to stay at hotels such as the Yangtze River Hotel. We in the first group to Changsha, except for a few who visited relatives and friends in Hankou and left separately, all went to the Shanghai Bank reception office to rest, and had dinner there. At 7 o'clock, we gathered at the German Second Wharf and took the Yuehan Railway Bureau ferry to the Wuchang Xujiapeng Station. At 8:30 p.m., we boarded the first-class sleeping car specially prepared by the Xiang-E section of the Yuehan Railway. When I woke up, we had passed Yueyang and the train had reached Taolin Temple. At a quarter past ten, the train arrived in Changsha. The provincial government sent Zhu Jingnong, Director of the Department of Education, Hu Shuhua, President of Hunan University, and many people from the banking community in Changsha to welcome us at the station. When the train arrived at the platform, military music was played and soldiers lined up to pay their respects. A long white banner of the provincial government with the words "Welcome to all members of the 11th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society" was hung high at the entrance of the station. When leaving the station, three alcohol-powered cars from the Hunan Industrial Testing Institute, prepared by the welcoming organizations, drove directly to the Tongyuanju Wharf on the Xiang River. We changed to motorboats and circled the Orange Isle (also known as Shuiluzhou) in the center of the Xiang River to board at Yidufang at the foot of Yuelu Mountain. Then, we boarded public buses and drove to Hunan University.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Members Club Member Chen Fuxing Suspended from Competition for One Year</h3>
<p>Due to Water Polo Match Defeat, He Took His Anger Out on the Referee and Insulted Him Willfully</p>
<p>Hong Kong Sports Association Resolved to Submit a Request to the National Sports Association for Record</p>
<p>On July 21st, during the Public Water Polo Championship organized by the Hong Kong Chinese Amateur Athletic Federation, at the end of the match between the Government Chinese Civil Servants' Association and South China A, Chen Fuxing, the captain of the Civil Servants' Association team, took his anger out on the referee Ye Guanxian due to the defeat, insulting him willfully and even kicking Mr. Ye. Afterwards, Mr. Ye reported the incident to the Hong Kong Sports Association. After investigation by the Executive Committee of the Association, it was deemed that Chen Fuxing had violated sportsmanship, and it was resolved to suspend Chen Fuxing from participating in various sports on land and water for one year (i.e., from August 2, 1934, to August 1, 1935). It is reported that the resolution has been filed with the National Amateur Athletic Federation of China, and the National Sports Association has approved the filing.

<h3>You You Cup Final Upset: Wang Wenzheng Defeats Lin Baohua</h3>
<p>| 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 |</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng's Unusual Performance Was Exceptionally Good</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Played with Illness, Barely Coping</p>
<p>The result of yesterday's You You Cup Tennis Singles Championship final was unexpectedly surprising. Wang Wenzheng defeated Lin Baohua in straight sets. Lin was slightly unwell and played with illness, while Wang Wenzheng happened to be in excellent form, with a particularly good performance, thus creating this upset. Yesterday, many believed that the match would be exciting, so over two hundred people went to the You You Athletic Association to watch, creating a grand scene. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng {6-1, 6-2, 6-1} Lin Baohua</p>
<h3>Wang and Lin's Performance</h3>
<p>Wang Wenzheng's performance yesterday was indeed unique. His shots were powerful, and his forehand and backhand strokes had very few errors, being unusually steady. The balls he shot at Lin's corners made it difficult for Lin to cope. Because Lin was slightly unwell and unable to run, the entire match was sacrificed in a haphazard manner. Moreover, his arm strength was also out of control, and his shots were rarely controlled. The number of times he hit the net was countless, resulting in a dull and lifeless situation.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Final</h3>
<p>Lin's carelessness on the court also contributed to the loss. In the first set, Wang won the first two games. After Lin won one game, Wang took the upper hand and won four consecutive games, winning the first set 6-1. In the second set, they were tied at 1-1 and 2-2. Although Lin tried his best to rally, he ultimately felt that his heart was not in it. Wang then won four consecutive games again, winning the second set 6-2. In the third set, Lin was already at the end of his rope and powerless. He only won one game when the score was 4-0. Finally, Wang won the third set 6-1 with an excellent shot on the sideline, passing Lin. The entire match only took fifty minutes.</p>
<h3>Baohua's Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Lin Baohua after the match when interviewed by reporters, he was bitten by a poisonous insect and suddenly developed a fever and chills. He had requested a postponement, but the news had already been announced, so he had to play reluctantly. He said that Wang's performance today was indeed excellent, and even if he were not sick, it would have been difficult to cope. According to Chen Shao, the general secretary of the You You Association, Lin requested a postponement, but did not mention his illness, so it was not approved. Otherwise, they would have found a way to remedy the situation.</p>

<h3>Xian Fang Cup Today's Second Division Makeup Matches</h3>
<p>You You Team Has Secured the Championship</p>

The final total score was 9-6 in favor of You Yi. Currently, the Railway Tongji team has completed all its matches. The Secretariat has set the order for the remaining makeup matches, which will be fully completed by September 2. Although You You still has two matches to play, their score is only two points less than the Railway team. Therefore, they are almost certain to win this year's championship. The runner-up will be the Railway team. If this is the case, their results will be the opposite of last year, which is quite interesting. There are two makeup matches today, with the order as follows:</p>

<h3>Comparison of Sports Funding in Pingjin, Baoding, Wuchang, Changsha, Kaifeng, Jinan, Anqing and Other Schools</h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, a sports inspector from the Ministry of Education, inspected 170 middle schools in Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, Wuchang, Changsha, Kaifeng, Jinan, Anqing, and other places, and compiled a comparison of the sports funding situation in middle schools in various regions. The following is an excerpt: (1) Number of Middle Schools: Beiping 53, Tianjin 11, Baoding 2, Wuchang 5, Changsha 18, Kaifeng 11, Jinan 3, Anqing 5.</p>
<p>(2) Number of Students: Ping 15932, Jin 6087, Bao 990, Chang 2039, Sha 7664, Kai 4907, Ji 1538, Qing 1677.</p>
<p>(3) Recurrent Expenses: Ping 78761, Jin 14423, Bao 5282, Chang 4910, Sha 22205, Kai 20600, Ji 7670, Qing 4159.99 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Percentage of Sports Funding in School Funding: Ping 5.76, Jin 3.50, Chang 4.25, Sha 3.12, Kai 7.95, Ji 6.93, Qing 2.20.</p>
<p>(5) Temporary Expenses: Ping 7000, Jin 350, Bao 1650, Chang 1577, Sha 2992, Kai 2118, Ji 630, Qing 650 yuan.</p>

<p>(Explanation): (1) The percentage of sports funding in the overall school funding seems to be too low and needs to be increased. (2) Many private schools do not have designated sports funding, and the sports fees paid by students are included in the calculation. (3) The sports fees paid by students vary depending on the school's financial situation, with some charging as much as 2 or 3 yuan, especially in private schools, which needs to be limited.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the following is a comparison of the academic qualifications of sports teachers in middle schools in various regions: Among the 293 teachers in 170 schools, 118 graduated from university sports departments, 101 from specialized sports schools, 19 from normal schools, 27 were former athletes, and 28 were others.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Football Team's Success This Season</h3>
<p>Defeats Gonghua 4-0</p>
<p>The Gonghua Football Team, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Staff Association, arranged a friendly match with the Shanghai Postal Workers Union Football Team at the Xianshi Stadium on Jiangwan Road to improve their skills and strengthen their relationships. The Gonghua team had notable players such as Zhou Shaowen and had considerable strength. Although the Postal Workers had won the Labor Games football championship, this was their first match this season. As a result, both sides were evenly matched at the end of the first half. After the break, the Postal Workers' defense and forwards showed better coordination. Although Gonghua tried their best to defend, they were ultimately scored on four times in succession by Postal Workers Zhuang Xiufa and Zhang Guanhong, causing chaos. The referee blew the whistle, and everyone dispersed with cheers. The Postal Workers' formation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Xin</p>
<p>Bao Boyu Zhang Shilin</p>
<p>Shu Zhuping Zhang Guanhong (Up) Zheng Wenkui (Up)</p>
<p>Xu Duo Zheng Wenkui (Down) Zhang Guanhong (Down)</p>
<p>Sun Huifang Shen Wenxun Zhuang Xiufa</p>

<h3>Macau Ping Pong Team Cancels Trip to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Table Tennis Association previously received a letter from the Macau Table Tennis Federation stating that they would lead the table tennis champion team from Taoying School to Shanghai for a competition at the end of this month. After receiving the news, the Association immediately held a meeting to discuss and prepared everything. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that for the sake of caution, the Association sent a telegram on the 26th to inquire whether they would arrive in Shanghai on schedule in order to make preparations. However, Chen Yiliu of Taoying School sent a letter yesterday stating that due to certain influences, they have decided to cancel their trip to Shanghai. Therefore, the Association has notified all teams of the cancellation of the Taoying team's trip to Shanghai. An international competition has thus become a pipe dream.</p>

<h3>No Important Telegrams Arrived in the Financial Market, Gold Market Became More and More Dull</h3>
<p>Initially Weak, Later Stable, Slight Decrease of Two Jiao</p>
<p>Although the gold market slightly decreased yesterday, the overall situation of the day was initially weak and later stable. People's minds were calm, and there were no special changes. In the morning, overseas silver markets in England and the United States had rebounded, and London spot gold fell by one penny. Exchange rates were still shrinking. US cotton fell by 11 pounds per ounce, and US wheat shrank by 1.625 points. Stocks fell by one yuan and a little more. The opening price of general goods was slightly reduced to 55.60 yuan. The gold industry's preliminary transactions also showed a slight decline. People's minds were calm. After the opening, the market was still stable. Later, as the banks' appetite became excessively saturated, the exchange market suddenly hardened and fell. Reuters reported that the US dollar might depreciate again. Sellers in the market bravely lowered prices. At this time, as the HSBC list was announced, both England and the United States were flat, and the market slightly stabilized after the fall. However, the banks' internal market was still hard, so the market fluctuated. It has been a long time since there has been a lack of special changes. Later, as the banks continued to push down, the US exchange rate slightly tightened, and buyers were able to take advantage of the situation to become active and rebound. However, there was not much upward momentum, and it soon fell again as the banks became saturated again. Xinfeng Foreign Firm's private telegram said that the US would reduce the fineness of the US dollar after September. Reuters said that the US government would hold $1.2 billion in free public bonds on October 15. Finally, the demand for supply in the market was still flat, and the potential for stable closing was good. Later, a telegram from Mumbai reported a decline of 1.11 annas. The market was extremely calm, and people's minds had become firm. Chinese merchants repurchased US dollars, and the exchange market gradually tightened. The gold market also rose. Although there were fluctuations due to hedging supply, the rise and fall were very sluggish. Later, a second telegram from Mumbai reported another decline of 1.11 annas. The buying sentiment in the market suddenly surged, and prices rose further. After the market closed, it was also firm. The overall trend in the one-yuan range was mediocre, with limited ups and downs. The lack of important telegrams led to a dull trend. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>

The morning opening prices of the exchange market were: recent selling price of the British exchange rate was 1 shilling, 4 pence, 6875 and 75. The US exchange rate was 35.25 and 3125 yuan. Although Bingxing and Dadecheng rose to 5.60 yuan, they fell back to 3.20 yuan due to the hardening of the internal market and the selling by Dafayuan, Fuxing, Yongda, Xingyong, Dingtai, and others. In anticipation of the HSBC list, the prices of British and American exchanges were flat. Dafayong, Fufu Yuna, and others rose to 4.10 yuan.

Yicheng, Tianfeng, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, and others slightly sold. Thereafter, the price fluctuated outside of 5 yuan, but the situation stabilized due to the purchase of Yongli by Fuxingyong. Later, a second telegram from Mumbai reported another decline of one anna. People's minds were invigorated, and November US dollars at 4375 had become difficult to settle. Qianchangxiang, Fuxingyong, Bingxing, and others vigorously bought, and the price rose to 6.20 yuan. The closing price was 955.90 yuan. After the market closed, Bingxing, Fuxingyong, Zhaofengchang, Zhentai, Ruikang, Tongchun, and others all came in, and the price rose further.

Initially, the Tianjin gang sold more than 2,000 taels of spot goods to Yingfengheng at a price of 13.50 to 14 yuan. Then they repurchased futures, about 3,000 taels or so, which were thrown by spot numbers such as Yingfeng, Hengtai, Kangrun, and others at a price of 15.25 to 15.50 yuan. In terms of swap, Fuchang paid Hengyu 84 tiaos at 5 jiao. After entering, Hongxingyong had more long positions willing to pay to enter. There were rumors that the Central Bank would open spot, but there were not many transactions. There were 2,261 tiaos left in September, with a total of 11 long positions and 8 short positions.</p>

Banks were actively buying shillings. Market conditions were small and uncertain. Later, due to bank buying, the market once tightened. In the end, it became tight again due to the high price. The underlying trend remained strong due to private telegrams from foreign firms stating that the US government would continue to reduce the gold content of the US dollar after the ninth. Although the after-market opening was flat, banks were eager to buy British pounds and reluctant to sell US dollars. The Bombay market fell by one anna. Chinese merchants came to buy, leading to tightening. Finally, Bombay fell another anna, tightening the situation.

<h3>Silver Dollar Autumn Demand Begins to Activate</h3>
<p>Since the tense market atmosphere after the export of silver dollars, the current situation has eased slightly. However, as autumn demand has begun to activate, the market atmosphere is unlikely to remain as sluggish as before, and a further tightening is inevitable. Yesterday's interbank loan rate was still one dime, the same in the morning and afternoon. Looking at the market situation as a whole, a decline is unlikely in the short term. Adding water to the allotment was due to the market allotment being looser than before, leading to a decrease of six points, with a rate of only two points.

<h3>Securities Continue to Fall, Short Covering Rises, Bond Market Shows Sharp Reversal Yesterday</h3>
<p>| Futures Delivery Suspended Today for August |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market conditions suddenly rebounded, rapidly and fiercely, completely recovering the previous day's losses and then some. There was no increase or decrease in news between the two days, and interbank rates did not fluctuate. Pressing it makes it small, lifting it makes it high; the power is completely in the hands of the operators on the floor. Most general retail investors are sacrifices to them. The environment certainly does not warrant a frantic drop, nor is there reason for a frantic rise. Amidst the mixed and uncertain news, there is a sudden, abnormally rising and falling trend. Taking advantage of such situations is truly a good opportunity. The future trend is still unable to embrace optimism as a result. Yesterday only did three sessions, from morning to night, completely tending upwards, without any sign of fatigue in between. Although the Northern banks still sold, entrants were already eager, and the floor also had some short covering. Nos. 41 and 48 were bought more. As a result of the entire day, the rise was one yuan or so to over two yuan. The total amount traded was estimated at over 20 million yuan. Today is the delivery date for August futures; the market is closed for one day. The details of the rises and falls are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Type Futures Highest Lowest Compared to Previous Day</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Clean and Soft</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm yesterday (27th) New York stock market, quite desolate, prices were mixed and falling. Because Labor Day is approaching, speculators went out to enjoy themselves. The most noteworthy aspect of the market was that the Alaska gold mine stock was very weak due to profit-taking by bulls, resulting in gold and silver stocks wavering. Because the inflation rumor subsided, short sellers of US dollars covered their positions, so the US dollar exchange rate was still firm. The movements of the small exchange and the bond market were aimless. Selling pressure in the Canadian grain exchange shook the Chicago market, causing local banks to disengage. However, the news was favorable for the bulls. According to the report, the visible supply of wheat increased by only 446,000 bushels last week. Total daily volume was 530,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>August 25th August 27th Rise/Fall</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower Marked Yarn Bullish Line Wavering</h3>
<p>Near Term Breaks 80 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to weaken, as the spot yarn sales field feels more and more bleak. The bullish mood is becoming more difficult to stabilize. In addition, the banditry in Sichuan is rampant, and cotton yarn transactions suddenly lack, and people's hearts are weak. The amount absorbed by the financial community, considering the poor environment, is very much cut and settled. In terms of actual needs, the yarn market is particularly depressed. Therefore, the September contract broke through the 180 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Falls First, Then Returns</h3>
<p>In the morning opening of the Marked Yarn market, the American cotton continued to fall, and the market sentiment of the previous day was weak, so the bullish line was slightly shaken. Moreover, there are 1,000 bales to be delivered this month, and the spot yarn sales on the market are stagnant, so the people's hearts tend to be low. The September contract fell into the 80 yuan mark, and the far-month contracts also dragged into weakness. All months fell by five, six, seven, and eight jiao. The afternoon opening was still soft, but at the third closing, the short sellers profited from offsetting, turning to rise by three or four jiao. The total volume of transactions for the whole day was 59,600 bales. It was found that DAFU sold 3,500 bales, Tongji 5,050 bales, Hengyi 1,250 bales, Taixing 4,100 bales, Changji 750 bales, Dafu 800 bales, Junchang 900 bales, Yuantai 1,100 bales, Runkang 1,450 bales, and Xiesheng 1,100 bales. Dafeng bought 2,650 bales, Daji 1,500 bales, Jinchang 750 bales, Shenchang 1,400 bales, Shenji 4,400 bales, Renfeng 1,250 bales, and Hengchang 4,650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>September 179.7 179.0 179.3 Down 0.70 54,000</p>
<p>October 181.2 180.5 180.8 Down 0.60 61,800</p>

<p>January 185.1 184.6 185.1 Down 0.10 42,400</p>
<p>Total 270,950</p>
<h3>Spot Sales Less Than 500 Bales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales remained sluggish. It was found that the total amount purchased by various groups throughout the day was 445 bales. Prices fell by two and a half jiao to five jiao. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 105 Counterparts 95</p>
<p>Guangdong 240 Ningbo 6</p>
<h3>Major Players Covering Shorts Cause Cotton to Fall and Then Rise</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but U.S. cotton continued to fall, and some major shorts in the local market covered their positions during the fall, so the market reversed to be tight and expensive. However, the spot cotton sales on the market were very quiet, and the factories had no ideas, because the yarn market was poor, and they were unwilling to purchase raw materials. Moreover, new cotton from various places is gradually entering the market.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao and Dafu Replenish 13,000 Dan</h3>
<p>The Marked Cotton market opened in the morning, weakening along with the weakness of the foreign cotton, but Dafu greatly covered, bringing the market tight. As a result, each month fell by one jiao to one and a half jiao. In the afternoon, the buying in the market was even more intense, and each month rose again by five cents to two and a half jiao. The total amount traded for the whole day was 88,500 dan. It was found that Shenchang sold 3,300 dan, Gengfeng 2,200 dan, Tongfu 2,400 dan, Tongji 2,800 dan, Hengyi 2,000 dan, Renfeng 3,500 dan, Changfeng 1,800 dan, Runkang 3,900 dan, Deji 2,300 dan, and Changhe 1,800 dan. Dafu bought 13,900 dan, Yuanda 1,800 dan, Taixing 2,300 dan, Yuantai 2,100 dan, Yongchang 1,300 dan, Dafu 1,600 dan, and Dachang 1,900 dan.

<p>Total 805,500</p>

<p>Donggou cotton, 39.00. Shenxin Factory takes in 500 bales of spot goods for delivery to the factory.</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets All Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was weak due to a lack of major buyers, rain in Texas, and selling in the South. As a result, spot prices fell by ten points, and futures fell by ten to fourteen points. English cotton futures fell by sixty-seven points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to short covering and profit-taking by bulls, and then recovered slightly due to some buying by Japanese and European exporters. As a result, Pingguoer fell by 1.75 rupees, Aomula fell by three rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 3.25 rupees. Original telegram record left (telegraph on the 27th):</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Market Weak After Afternoon Attempted Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, all months showed signs of weakening. Foreign wheat was quoted at 456 jiao less for Chicago and around 56 jiao less for Canada. When the prices were announced, the market for each month continued to fall. The current month once fell to as low as 5 jiao 3.5 fen. The remaining months were 2 to 3 fen lower compared to the previous day's closing price. However, after the second session, the market atmosphere turned to hovering, because the short positions for the current month were also covering due to the low and tired market price. There were very few far-term short positions, and the buying was still active, resulting in a mutual confrontation. The ups and downs were limited. By the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere showed a rebound. The current month's price was firm due to small factories trading to change dates. It was heard that the large factories were also entering a small number of offsets, and people's hearts were revived. Although the market for the months after November was slightly better than the morning, the sentiment was still slightly soft due to hedging sales, so the final result was still a small change. As a result, the current month was only better by 5 li, September and October were better by 2.5 li, November was better by 7.5 li, December was better by 1.25 fen, and January was better by 2.25 fen.</p>
<h3>Local Wheat Mill Sales Still Unchanged</h3>
<p>| Wheat Futures Market Declines |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a dismal decline in all months after opening in the morning and afternoon. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago and Canada were 4, 5, and 6 jiao lower. Market sentiment was due to sluggish flour sales, and the buying interest inside and outside the industry was also restrained. The inland banks, seeing rainfall in various places, also loosened their sentiment. Therefore, although trading was not very smooth in each session in the morning and afternoon, the market atmosphere was unusually soft, falling much more sharply than the previous day. Looking at the market later, the prosperity of flour sales will determine the rise and fall. As a result, the current month continued to fall by a huge 1 jiao, October fell by 8 fen, November fell by 7 fen, and December fell by 5 fen. The spot wheat market also showed instability. Due to the abundant market inventory and the lack of interest from factories, those eager to sell had to accept lower prices. Therefore, each grade fell by 6 to 7 fen compared to the previous day. Kaixu, Shandong, Guide, and Dangshan wheat were at 3.97 yuan, Bengbu wheat was at 3.95 yuan, and Bao Ying wheat was at 3.91 yuan, totaling 13,000 bags, purchased by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Heshang Rice Stagnant Sales, Falling 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more sources from various banks, with a total of over 30 shops (a total of 4,500 shi), but the sales market was even more stagnant. The Qingdao gang made a move, but the number was only a few hundred bags, which did not help the overall situation. The market prices of each product continued to fall by 3 to 4 jiao. Duyangjian and Yinyuan relied on the lack of goods to stabilize. For new japonica rice, except for the lack of goods from the factory East New, which remained at the old price of 12 yuan, the rest of the Heshang goods opened sparingly, and the price also depreciated by 2 to 3 jiao. Baiyuan, Bo Dao, and Yangbujian's price fell by a small 1 to 2 jiao. Kejian was flat and tired. The price of Dongxin japonica rice remained stable. New Kejian's railway transportation was slightly available, and retail sales were normal. The price opened at 11.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Futures Foreign Rice Suddenly Falls 4-5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for foreign Ke Xian rice saw changes again. There was a slight increase in Ke Xian machinery stone rice, and influenced by the dumping of foreign rice, the owners were quite willing to sell. Therefore, except for a portion of particularly high-quality goods, each was a small 1 to 2 jiao lower. However, rough Xian rice was still being purchased by the inland area, and the amount arriving was not seen to be much. Yesterday, the market was able to hold steady, but since the Shen price was reported to have risen, all places were in the process of loading and transporting. Now, if a Wang arrives in port tomorrow, the market price may have to follow suit. The whole city opened 6,000 bags of each Xian rice, all purchased by the inland area.</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures foreign rice had brokers selling back, because after several days of high prices, the goods they had recently purchased had made a lot of money. Moreover, the foreign firms who had previously placed orders also sought to sell according to the market to recover their funds. Recycled goods and new transactions competed with each other, and the market price immediately saw a sudden fall. After the afternoon, entrants waited and watched. The inland area was stagnant due to rain, and the market immediately showed a lack of support. Saigon No. 1 September fell to as low as 5.45 yuan, falling by a small 3 jiao compared to yesterday's market (1 shi must be a small 4.5 jiao). In October and November, the morning price still opened to 5.8 yuan, but in the afternoon it was 5.55 yuan. Finally, no one accepted even 5.55 yuan. In February and March, the small-grained ones were also as low as 5.55 yuan. Spot small-grained ones were also a small 2 to 3 jiao lower. Saigon goods lacked support, but Saigon road goods were already as low as 11.6 yuan, also falling by about half a yuan. No. 2 Saigon was traded for the first time yesterday, with the price opening at 1.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fanyang New Mixed Green Beans Listed</h3>
<p>| Price Opens at 4.6 Yuan |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of 131 bags of new mixed green beans from Jiujiang Poyang arrived in the market, with the price opening at 4.6 yuan, purchased by the Ningbo gang. They were released today, and the quality was better than in previous years. The rest of the new beans were prompted by the rush to purchase by transport brokers during the previous surge in prices, so the arrival source has been surging recently, and the market is inevitably softening. The departure route has also been reduced. It is estimated that the city has traded more than 200 bags of Chengmentou beans, 73 bags of Zhuxi beans, 37 bags of Duchang beans, and 30 bags of Liufangchi beans. However, Hankou early yellow beans can still be sold a lot, because the quality of the goods is better, so the market is stable. Its high-end Jinpi beans have opened to 4.22 yuan, and Baipi beans have also opened to 3.95 yuan, with a total of over 600 bags traded.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Foreign Firms Silk Sales Difficult to Progress</h3>
<p>Although the prices of raw silk in the European and American silk markets have risen, the inventory is thick, and sales are sluggish. The Huangbai factory jing and others in Shanghai have not received encouraging telegrams, and the general hoarder holds the goods in his hands, and there is no owner yet. The hoarding market is silent. Yesterday, only English and Indian firms took in 20 bags of Huangbai factory jing and 15 bags of coarse yellow silk, and the price remained flat.</p>
<h3>Double Cocoon Silk Shanghai Inventory Not Weak</h3>
<p>There is a high demand for double officer silk prints. The Fulun and Honglun two palace silk factories in Shanghai are busy with work, and the consumption of raw materials has increased sharply. The inventory is gradually thinning. The total stock of double officer cocoons in various foreign godowns in Shanghai is less than 500 dan, so the price is uniquely firm.</p>
<h3>Lushang Zhenmei Transactions Still Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, the English firm Jardine Matheson again made a large-scale purchase of Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan Tunxi and other places. Jinlong, Tongfu and other firms also had sporadic purchases. The total volume of transactions in the city reached more than 2,200 boxes, and the transactions were still not lonely. However, due to the strict prices from abroad, the market sentiment was tired and weak, and there was still a decline without an increase in prices. In addition, the sales of Zhenmei and Xiumei green tea were slightly more active, but the sales of large green teas to the United States remained stagnant.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Arrives Sparsely, Inventory Thin</h3>
<p>| Step Up 2 Jiao |</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a gradual increase of 2 jiao between the previous day and yesterday because only slightly over 12,000 bags of 24 coarse sand white arrived on the previous day, and the inventory was short of money. The association's set price was 19.9 jiao for spot goods, 19.98 jiao for delivery at the dock, and 6.65 jiao for transit goods. However, the market is still expected to ease, and the cargo that is expected to arrive on the 9th of next month is offered by Changxing with slightly over 1,000 bags at a price of 6.5 jiao. New rules, foreign tax, Dutch red spot 14.9 jiao, transit 5.7 jiao, no rise or fall. Taikoo Sugar B mixed 20.1 jiao, a good rise of 5 fen. Benchang Mianbai Zhenyu No. 1 18.8 jiao, Zhenji No. 1 18.9 jiao, each up 1 jiao. Benchang medium bag No. 3 ice more than 100 bags 22.9 jiao. Xinghua white opened several dozen bags, 18.5 jiao, secondary goods 18.1 jiao. Pianqinghao's family slightly loosened their mind, calling for a small 2 jiao, at 11.6 jiao, but there were still few transactions.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Southern and Northern Goods Orchid Seeds First Water</h3>
<p>Quantity Relatively Large...Decreased by About Three Yuan</p>
<p>Due to the limited quantity of first water orchid seeds, the high-quality goods once reached forty-seven or forty-eight yuan, but were quickly sold out. Now the first water goods are continuing to arrive, but the quantity is still not large. According to news from Zhangzhou, there are only a hundred and several dozen dan, so the price cannot be significantly lowered. Yesterday, over seventy boxes arrived and were immediately opened for sale. Compared to the initial price, it decreased by about three yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware and Small Canton Leather Shortages Lead to Sharp Price Increases</h3>
<p>｜New Seven-Foot Dongtie Goods Are Arriving｜</p>
<p>Small Canton leather is essential for enamelware and thermos factories. Recently, buyers from places like Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping have also started to purchase them, but the market supply is very limited, leading to a severe shortage of stock. As a result, prices have risen sharply. The current market price is estimated at ten yuan and five jiao per dan, an increase of five jiao from before. However, inferior goods are only selling for nine yuan five or six jiao due to their damaged condition, and buyers are purchasing less of them, so the market remains stable. People in the industry have reported that over three thousand dan of this product are expected to arrive on the sixth of next month.</p>
<p>The price of seven-foot Dongyang (Japanese) white iron has increased by one yuan and three jiao due to shortages. It is said that over twenty thousand sheets of new goods are expected to arrive tomorrow or the day after.</p>

<h3>Jobs Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>Recently, two friends, both fresh out of school, stayed in Shanghai for two months and then went to other cities. Their purpose in coming to Shanghai was to find work. It seems they left because they failed to find work, but on the contrary, they both quit their jobs. Moreover, before quitting their current jobs, they had already secured one or two other positions.</p>
<p>I don't want to reveal my friends' private matters regarding their job searches and resignations. What their experiences made me realize is that the common belief among inlanders that jobs are everywhere in Shanghai is not entirely wrong, but what kind of jobs are available is worth considering.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as someone who has received a considerable education myself, I can only understand the fate that awaits those who come out of school. High school graduates (hereafter referred to as graduates) can easily find jobs paying twenty yuan a month, while university graduates can receive double the reward. This pricing seems to have a reasonable basis. If it typically costs two thousand yuan more to produce a university graduate, then based on the calculation of investment benefits, they should only receive an additional twenty yuan in interest each month. By analogy, those who have not spent over a thousand yuan like high school students can naturally only afford to eat. Perhaps, the salary for high school students is calculated based on apprenticeship treatment.</p>
<p>I am willing to accept Mr. So-and-so's view that this treatment is fair, and one should be satisfied to have this opportunity. If one disdains it, then one is seeking one's own ruin and deserves to be unemployed.</p>
<p>However, setting the prices for high school and university graduates at this level seems to be a recent development, and it is not yet widespread. If it is truly fair, shouldn't it be implemented universally to eliminate inequality? Furthermore, since high school and university graduates deserve such fair compensation, will schools in the future be able to say, as some vocational school advertisements do, that for those who do not find employment after graduation, the school will provide a monthly subsidy of twenty yuan? (This only applies to high school students.)</p>
<p>I fear that the decline in the job market is just like the decline in the commodity market. After buyers are able to purchase goods cheaply, they demand even lower prices. Moreover, employers have far more control over the prices of employees than buyers have over controlling commodity prices. If high school and university graduates accept the current fixed price as fair, buyers will surely think that this price is still preferential, and the price may immediately fall again.</p>
<p>In fact, this "may" is not an overstatement at all. There are not many high school students who are dissatisfied with a salary of twenty yuan a month now. Because many people have already compromised, a certain large hotel's waiter training school has been able to recruit many high school students to be trained as waiters. This result inspired a businessman, who is planning to recruit a group of primary school students to train as tea servers (waiters). Moreover, I heard that a certain middle school is training management personnel—a more beautiful term than waiters—for the passenger cabins of ships.</p>
<p>I certainly do not think that being a tea server is a degradation of one's profession, although the nature of service of a tea server now contains another fundamental problem. However, if one is enticed into wanting to be a tea server, I always think that one has been deceived. At least some people still feel that there is a boundary between the tea server profession and noble professions, and unfortunately, those running the training school belong to that group. After they test the extent to which job seekers are willing to compromise, they will inevitably lead to a further decline in the purchase price of the job market.</p>
<p>Naturally, the unemployment problem is very complex. People who are unemployed because they are unwilling to compromise are actually only a small part of the large group of unemployed people. However, when I think of the above situation, when I raise this part as a problem, I feel that these unemployed people are rather lovable. We have long had the morality of not being ashamed to take small jobs, but recognizing oneself and being unwilling to compromise is a new sprout that is very difficult to cultivate. This new sprout will inevitably be destroyed by some, but the natural growth force will always enable it to emerge from the struggle.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Beijing Clique</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>It was probably Baiyiju Shi's "Hutian Lu," which talks about the story of New Year's Eve in Beijing, and records a self-written couplet by a certain Xiucai on New Year's Eve:</p>
<p>"Release a thousand branches of firecrackers to drive away the god of poverty. For several years, I have been troubled by this petty servant, leaving me with empty hands.</p>
<p>Burn three sticks of high incense to invite the god of wealth. From now on, I hope you, old master, will protect me with ten thousand strings of coins around my waist."</p>
<p>It turns out that although Beijing was in the late Qing Dynasty and the national fortune was not good, it was still very prosperous. Government officials wanted to put on airs, and shopkeepers and residents also wanted to put on airs. For example, taking the Lunar New Year as an example, the rich loved the excitement and set off a lot of firecrackers; it didn't matter if the poor had no food to eat, firecrackers had to be set off, as if they weren't worthy of living in Beijing if they didn't. Baiyiju Shi said that he tasted this point with great interest, and he understood the taste of the Beijing clique!</p>
<p>Originally rich people pretending to be poor and humble is of course unnecessary; originally poor scholars pretending to be high-ranking officials and young masters is even more unbearable. Also, of course you don't have to be proud if you have a lot of face; why bother to be proud by borrowing someone else's face? "Lord Sanbao personally scolded me for being a bastard," is that something you can brag about? Wei Zhongxian is your adopted father, does that mean you've gained glory? However, there are still many people who put on airs, talk about false occasions, and love vanity. The vulgar people that Mr. Lin Yutang scolded should be these kinds of people, if they exist.</p>
<p>If you want to be a disciple of the sages, you can't help but create a lineage of thought, passing the way of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius to your teacher, so that their mantle will belong to you. If you want to be a literary giant, you can't help but create a literary lineage, recognizing all the thinkers from the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the late Ming Dynasty as the school of expressing intentions, so that the school of expressing intentions is supreme in the literary world, and you are considered to have inherited the orthodoxy of the school of expressing intentions. Praising the ancients is originally for self-aggrandizement, deceiving the world, and stealing reputation. The trick is not unskilled, and the method is not advanced.</p>
<p>Naturally, Mozi also said something like this: "Love others as yourself, and yourself is in what you love." But using this as a method of self-aggrandizement is also used very clumsily. For example, if you are a thin southerner, but you prefer to praise a fat northerner, and you also wear wide-sleeved clothes, thinking that you are a member of the fat northerner party, that would be laughable. Also, although Beijing has been the capital of the country for hundreds of years, it is natural that a lot of broken copper and scrap iron have accumulated. If you take it out to show off to others, saying that this is Beijing goods, and you call yourself a connoisseur, the broken copper and scrap iron may not increase in price, but the person speaking should feel too embarrassed!</p>
<p>The children of ruined households love to boast about their ancestors' property. Nouveau riches also want to bring out a few ancestors with face. As a literary person, you can't help but describe the virtues of your ancestors and boast about your genius, which has been the case since Qu Yuan, so that's not surprising. Talent is unfounded, so you can boast blindly. Ancestral virtues are difficult to fake, perhaps you are still a descendant of Pan Hu. It is impossible to talk about the origins of the family, so you can only boast about the origins of teachers and friends. The poet and philosopher is my companion, the doctor is my friend, the scholar is my acquaintance, I have visited celebrities, they all lived in Beijing, and I also belong to the Beijing clique. This is the origin of the Beijing clique.</p>
<h3>Relics of Taibai</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Literary Talks Outside the Door</h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(V) Was the spoken and written language consistent in ancient times?</p>
<p>Here, I would like to guess whether the spoken and written language were consistent in ancient times.</p>
<p>Although scholars today have not reached a clear conclusion on this issue, judging by their tone, it seems that they generally believe that they were consistent; the more ancient, the more consistent. However, I am quite doubtful, because the easier the writing, the easier it is to write in accordance with the spoken language, but Chinese is such a difficult hieroglyphic script. Perhaps our ancestors have always removed unimportant words.</p>
<p>The difficulty of reading "Shujing" seems to be evidence of the direct transcription of spoken language, but the actual spoken language of the Shang and Zhou people has not yet been researched, and it may be even more complicated. As for the ancient books of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, although the authors also used a little of their local dialects, the writing was roughly similar. Even if it was still close to the spoken language, it was still Zhou and Qin vernacular, not the Zhou and Qin popular language. Needless to say about the Han Dynasty, although Sima Qian, who was willing to translate the difficult words in "Shujing" into modern characters, only used a little colloquial language under special circumstances. For example, Chen She's old friend saw him as king and exclaimed in surprise: "Huo Yi, She is king," but I still suspect that the four words "She is king" were modified by the Grand Historian.</p>
<p>Then, the nursery rhymes, proverbs, and folk songs collected in ancient books should be the old-fashioned colloquial language of that time, right? I think it's hard to say. Chinese writers have a habit of changing other people's articles. The most obvious example is the Huainan King Song of the Han people. The same song from the same place is recorded differently in "Hanshu" and "Qian Han Ji."</p>
<p>On one side it is:</p>
<p>A foot of cloth can still be sewn;</p>
<p>A dou of millet can still be pounded.</p>
<p>Two brothers cannot tolerate each other.</p>
<p>On the other side it is:</p>
<p>A foot of cloth, warm and fluffy;</p>
<p>A dou of millet, full of children.</p>
<p>Two brothers cannot tolerate each other.</p>
<p>Comparing them, it seems that the latter is the original appearance, but it is also possible that some have been deleted: it is just a summary. Later, the quotations of the Song people, the storytelling scripts, and the stage directions in the dramas and legends of the Yuan people were all summaries. It's just that they use more common words and delete fewer words, which makes people feel "clear as speech."</p>
<p>My speculation is that the spoken and written language of China has never been consistent. The main reason is that the characters are difficult to write, so you have to save some. The summary of the spoken language at that time was the writing of the ancients; the summary of the spoken language of ancient times was the classical Chinese of later generations. Therefore, our writing classical Chinese is to use hieroglyphs that are no longer like hieroglyphs, and phonetic characters that are not necessarily harmonious sounds, to depict on paper a summary of the spoken language of the ancients that no one speaks and few understand today. Do you think this is difficult?</p>
<h3>Poverty and Sickness</h3>
<p>— Wu Mao</p>
<p>I've been in bed for a week. Headache and fever, except for sometimes feeling thirsty and wanting to drink some plain water, I just close my eyes drowsily all day long.</p>
<p>The attic room is particularly gloomy, with no one around and no sound. Even my own painful groans, I don't want to scare myself, just let them shake on my heartstrings.</p>
<p>This is loneliness!</p>
<p>This is wandering!</p>
<p>However, I didn't think so.</p>
<p>I often repeat the words my friends said to me:</p>
<p>"Your face looks terrible."</p>
<p>"You should go to the hospital quickly."</p>
<p>"Don't waste yourself like this."</p>
<p>Am I really wasting myself? Absolutely not! I still want to live, and I cherish myself very much; I also know that my illness is very serious and I need to go to the hospital, but, I have no money now, no money, I can only answer:</p>
<p>"Let's wait a few more days."</p>
<p>These are not words to deceive people or even deceive myself, I really have a hope, hoping to wait until the bookstore that accepts my articles sends out the manuscript fee. ｜The manuscript fee is my lifesaver, this is not wishful thinking, the manuscript fee is issued on a regular basis.</p>
<p>"It's just these few days," is anxious, is comforting; continuing to delay like this, one day, and another day....</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang!" Someone is knocking on the door downstairs.</p>
<p>No one answers.</p>
<p>"Ah Li, open the door." The person is calling. I listen quietly, suspecting it is a friend who has come to see me. So, I reluctantly got out of bed, put on my pajamas, and tried my best to support my body to walk downstairs. My whole body went from hot to cold; my hands and feet were shaking, my lips were trembling, but I finally struggled to open the door.</p>
<p>"You..."! My friend was frightened when he saw my face.</p>
<p>"Da! Come in: go in". I greeted, my teeth chattering.</p>
<p>"Why are you so sick? You shouldn't have come down! Have you seen a doctor?" Da said non-stop while helping me upstairs.</p>
<p>I don't want to open my mouth.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother (III)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>When Mom was angrily trembling, my younger brother happened to cause trouble again outside, and Mom's beating was naturally even more rude. Mom beat while crying:</p>
<p>"Why are you so disappointing!"</p>
<p>"Ayoyo ayoyo..."</p>
<p>"Why have you become a human!"</p>
<p>"Ayoyo ayoyo..."</p>
<p>"Why are you..."</p>
<p>"Ayoyo ayoyo..."</p>
<p>At first, the people watching found it funny, but gradually they saw Mom hitting harder and harder, and my younger brother's voice was gone. They could only hear the crisp sound of the board on his buttocks.</p>
<p>This time, when Mom left the main room, my younger brother was gone. Suddenly, the whole house was frightened, and they took lanterns and went to find him in different directions. Mom was so anxious that her face turned pale, almost crazy, seeing the faces of those street neighbors gloating, as if saying that the Zhou family's widow had received "retribution"! So they gradually gathered around:</p>
<p>"Did he run away?"</p>
<p>"He ran away!"</p>
<p>"How did he run away?"</p>
<p>"Oh! He ran away!"</p>
<p>Mom heard these voices, fortunately she didn't faint. Mom cried and whispered to me that she regretted that she shouldn't have mistakenly beaten my younger brother. With great difficulty, he was found behind the main room door of my maternal uncle's house the next morning, and dragged back. From then on, everyone gave him the nickname "Manzi" (barbarian).</p>
<p>My younger brother did have a brute strength. He often ridiculed me; because I had been adopted by my paternal aunt to continue the family line. So sometimes after being bullied, when my younger brother saw me laughing at him, he would rudely shout:</p>
<p>"Roll, roll, roll back to your house!"</p>
<p>Although I felt like I was insulted, I had no choice but to let him. Sometimes I was really afraid that he would use his rude fist to hit my thin body.</p>
<p>"Um, um, shameless, freeloading off other people's food! You're rich, this new clothes is still from my family!" When he said this again, I really wanted to take off my clothes immediately and run to my paternal aunt's house in a huff. But Mom pulled me back. She told me not to believe his words. She said I was a child of both sides: he was "Manzi."</p>

<h3>The Front Line Is in China</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>I remember when I was a teenager, studying in elementary school, I saw a photo album of the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, because it was painted very beautifully and movingly, I carefully looked through it page by page. Inside, it depicted many scenes of the Russo-Japanese War battlefield, the Japanese warships sinking Russian warships. The scenes were very solemn and great, or dangerous and frightening. But what I still can't forget to this day is a page describing the Japanese soldiers trampling on the Chinese people. Inside, it wrote that several Japanese soldiers were carrying out rape and looting in a Chinese family. The woman fell to the ground, her small feet raised high. The Chinese man was dragged out by the Japanese soldiers by his braid. The room was full of overturned tables and chairs, and furniture and utensils were scattered all over the floor. At that time, I felt a little angry and a little sad. Why did the Chinese have to be bullied by the Japanese like this? Furthermore, why were the Chinese the victims of the Russo-Japanese War? Of course, I had no way of finding someone to answer these questions at the time. Later, when I got older and read the history of the Russo-Japanese War, I learned that the Russo-Japanese War at that time was entirely fought with the three northeastern provinces of China as the battlefield. The Chinese government was weak and could only let the two countries do whatever they wanted there. Now, times have changed, although it has been more than ten years, this very tragic scene is still deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>From the Russo-Japanese War to now, only a few decades have passed. Now, a new Russo-Japanese War is about to break out in Northeast China. Although this war is completely different in meaning from the previous Russo-Japanese War, that is, Japan is still an imperialist country, and it is an imperialist country after 1929, that is, the imperialist country in the last stage of capitalism, while Russia has become a socialist country, an anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist country. This war is Japan seeking its own way out by opposing the Soviet Union, and it is not like the previous Russo-Japanese War, which was a war between two imperialist countries for the rights of the Far East. However, one point is the same as the previous Russo-Japanese War, that is, the battlefield is still in China. If Japan attacks the Soviet Union, it must use my country's three northeastern provinces as a battlefield. At the same time, in order to maintain the rear, it must also use China as its reserve warehouse. In this way, the trampling on China will be a hundred times more than the previous Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The crisis of Japan's war of aggression against the Soviet Union is becoming more tense every day. The war is about to begin. How are we going to deal with ourselves?</p>
<h3>The Obstructed Traveler</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>I was forced to embark on the journey of life at the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>This journey is long and winding. Very few people can run to the end in one breath. Most people collapse halfway after running tired. The people following behind trample over the corpses and rush towards the future. The corpses are flattened, blurred, and soon, they are obliterated. This is the end of a professional traveler.</p>
<p>Trampled flat, blurred, obliterated - that's what it's all about.</p>
<p>"Tired! Tired!" Gasping and shouting in the rapids of life, unable to stop for a moment. The driver of life wields a long whip and follows closely behind. The giant wheel of time rolls in front. I foresee that one day I will fall out of the journey of life - even if I don't collapse halfway.</p>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>That day, while running, a "tripwire" seemed to be thrown, wiping away sweat, shrinking my heart, reading the manager's letter: "Sir, the company has recently been in poor business and it is difficult to maintain. For the sake of the overall situation, it has to save expenses and reduce personnel. The XX department will be merged into the XX department from next month. Please find another high position. Once the company sees some development, it will still give priority to employment. Sincerely, Mr. XX, Manager of XXXX Company." Isn't this a dismissal letter? After reading it again, the dismissal letter is still a dismissal letter. The volcano in my heart erupted!</p>
<p>The world is about to sink before my eyes, and the sky is also darkening.</p>
<p>Standing like a puppet in front of my writing desk, biting my lower lip tightly with my teeth, everything before my eyes is cruel. Only that Remington, that pen stand, that wire basket, are putting on a face of reluctance at parting. They have accompanied me in my journey, running frantically day, month, and year. Now, the obstructed traveler doesn't need them anymore. A meteor falling from the track of capital.</p>
<p>"Rest for a while!"</p>
<p>"Rest for a while!"</p>
<p>From now on, I don't have to get up at half past five: I don't have to wash up hastily: I don't have to squeeze into the third-class carriage of the No. 18 trolleybus on No. 1 Road: I don't have to hide in the gatehouse to eat fried tofu and rice cake: I don't have to escort trucks from the railway station to the ship dock, from the ship dock to the warehouse, basking in the sun in June, braving the wind in December.</p>
<p>I have rotated from the turbulent cycle, and ran from the segmented journey, being beaten by the whip of life and chasing the train of time!</p>
<p>"Tired! Rest for a while!"</p>
<p>However, people cannot leave life. I can't rely on my family anymore. I can't rely on my old parents to live. Although, they also see me exhausted and want me to rest for a while. Aren't my old parents rotating in the turbulent cycle of life? They are more tired than I am on the journey of life. Perhaps, they will soon be trampled flat, blurred, and obliterated.</p>
<p>I can't rest, I want to live! After falling down, I still have to throw myself up. A professional traveler cannot be obstructed on the journey for a long time, even if you clearly know that one day you will run out of energy, collapse halfway, be trampled flat, blurred, and even obliterated.</p>
<p>However, living people cannot but pursue life.</p>
<h3>Nursing Sisters</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>Wearing white caps, wearing white clothes. They look just like daughters in mourning! Their mood each day is always devoid of joy.</p>
<p>They come into contact with nothing but people wearing mournful faces.</p>
<p>But, nursing sisters, oh, in the nurses' station, that's where you laugh until you cry!</p>
<p>It doesn't matter! The bell is ringing in the sickroom, you can go slowly!</p>
<p>The patient's heart is irritable and grumbling!</p>
<p>She rolls her eyes and walks away unhappily.</p>
<p>Once, twice... a hundred times... two hundred times the bell rings. She ignores you!</p>
<p>There is one nursing sister.</p>
<p>She writes foreign words very well! She speaks foreign languages very fast too. Her temperament is exceptionally good. She does not neglect her duties at all. But her face is covered in wrinkles!</p>
<p>She often likes to linger in the wards.</p>
<p>She has no smiles.</p>
<p>"A ghost!" Seeing her in the dark, unfamiliar people would definitely shout that.</p>
<p>She is tall. A triangular face. Two eyes, sunken deep into their sockets. Lines upon lines of wrinkles, how frightening!</p>
<p>She is called "Miss Li!" Some people call her that: "Old Maid."</p>
<p>When others greet her: Turning her back, she always uses a handkerchief to wipe her eyes. It's because she is afraid tears will fall!</p>
<p>"Why are you crying?" A patient who is almost recovered, asks in confusion.</p>
<p>"Madam, now I... cannot tell you yet. Please rest quietly!"</p>
<p>She doesn't like to tell others about her sorrows. Anyway, sorrows cannot be shared by others.</p>
<p>On the day that madam was discharged: Madam found her, resolutely begging her to tell her sorrows. Madam felt very sorry for her.</p>
<p>So, she closed the door to the sickroom, faithfully telling that kind madam.</p>
<p>Several years ago, she was also working as a nurse in a certain hospital in another city. She fell in love with Doctor Wang from that hospital. ...She had a child. Later, she discovered that he was already married in his hometown! With a wound in her heart, she abandoned her child and drifted alone to Shanghai. It has been five years! There's been no definite news. Some say: "Your child is dead!"</p>
<p>Some say: "Your hometown and that Doctor Wang have both been submerged by a great flood!"</p>
<p>Her hometown, a hometown that was once flooded for more than five months. She has no heart to return. Let's not mention Doctor Wang! In this way, suffering day after day, until now.</p>
<p>Madam sympathized with her and said:</p>
<p>"Old Miss! Come to my house to play when you're free!" But she didn't tell her the address.</p>
<p>Madam left!</p>
<p>Patients groan and come in one after another. The people who accompany the patients all have worried expressions!</p>
<p>Nursing sisters wearing white caps and white clothes. Every day they are busy giving injections, dispensing medicine, taking temperatures,... but they are also busy applying powder, rouge, wearing high heels, carrying handbags, going to the cinema...</p>
<p>The mood of the nursing sisters we see is always devoid of joy!</p>
<p>The mood we imagine they have is perhaps as sweet and flavorful as chocolate candy! However, "Old Miss" is an exception!</p>
<h3>Song of a Solitary Person</h3>
<p>— Qiu Yue</p>
<p>Three Nights</p>
<p>The night is as quiet and desolate as water, the bright new moon smiles at me. Ah! You, the poet of nature. Mother of the night for the masses! Tonight you are frequently smiling, you are the most kindred spirit in my life, a lover in my dreams. || You are full of light smiles, your heart is glowing with brilliant light, shining on my future...</p>
<p>Ah, the stars are whispering, I hear their heartfelt voices. Like the eyes of a lover, containing a fire-like passion, they frequently glance at me. || Ah, I also hear, what is sadly wailing beside me? Ah, that's him, the trickling stream in the creek. Oh! You sob quietly, are you mourning my future and past?</p>
<p>Ah ah! Night traveler! Sniffle, I, this lonely traveler! Oh, pitiful shadow! Oh, laughable shadow! You follow me step by step, accompanying my loneliness and solitude, walking alone in this wilderness.</p>
<p>At this time: the wild wind is howling, the mountains are already asleep. From the jungle, far away, comes the mocking sound of the owl, laughing at this solitary person out so late at night.</p>
<p>Four A Dream in the Desert</p>
<p>Ah ah! I am tired, I am tired! From morning to night, whether evening or morning, I am forever stepping to the tune of loneliness, ha ha! Until now, I am tired, ah, tired!</p>
<p>Morning after morning, evening after evening, my unending pace, treads over those grasslands, those wilds, those jungles and paths. I can't remember, I can't calculate. What I can't stop hearing are the cries of jackals and wild dogs, what I can't stop seeing are the dancing shapes of demons and monsters.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Ha ha! Was I just asleep? Why am I awake again so soon! Ah! What a good dream! I wish to always be warm in your dream:</p>
<p>As if in a city that never sleeps: three-dimensional buildings, ten thousand shining lights, on the streets, cars, pedestrians. A majestic Apartment, with crystal as the palace, in the palace, there are male figures, female figures, laughter, pianos, violins. I walk past this palace, outside, the sounds of pianos, violins, laughter, male figures, female figures continue to float. I am drawn into this vortex: my body is shaking, my hands are dancing, my legs are moving: my body is gradually becoming lighter, my feet are unsteady. I slowly rise upwards, a huge gale blows me to the top of the sky, I fly across the sky, across the Milky Way, approaching the moon, taking a trip to the moon palace...</p>
<p>Five Song of Fallen Dew</p>
<p>It's already late at night! I alone, on this desolate desert: the wind is howling above my head, the sand is rustling, there is no sky to hide me, no camel to protect me. Oh, I, this solitary person on the desert!</p>
<p>Heaven! Let me rest here tonight, I don't want to return to that human world anymore! There is a darkness like hell, there is a tragedy like a slaughterhouse. Humans, are only selfish and self-serving, fighting and destroying each other! Ah! I once felt shame there, I once went mad there. I can't remember how many times I was deceived and fooled. Ha ha! Now, I will never return to those human worlds!</p>
<p>The heavenly wind rises, the sand flies, the rocks resound. Ah, let me rest here! Family, society, what am I still attached to? I have no father, no mother: no brothers: no sisters: no love, no relatives and neighbors. Ah, I am just coldly alone! The world has not cared about me, and I have not received the warmth of the human world...</p>
<p>Heaven! Let me rest here tonight, I don't want to return to that human world anymore.</p>
<h3>Hotel</h3>
<p>— Zhen Qiu</p>
<h3>Commotion in the Valley</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The last train was about to leave the platform, and after the third whistle, Old Cheng rushed to the station from C Village, more than five miles away. He usually arrived very early, and would go to the shed next to the elevator to see his son waiting to go underground to work. Today, because he walked too slowly, he had to pick up the bamboo basket, catch the train, and leave the mine to do business in Wulibridge.</p>
<p>The train left at more than six o'clock, and the setting sun, although still dragging its purplish-golden tail, was shining its faint light on the western horizon. But the valley was gradually covered with a layer of shadow, and all the scenery was blurred.</p>
<p>Night spread its black hand, covering the valley and the plain, the miners all went underground to work, and the people in the countryside had fallen asleep. A deathly silence shrouded the valley. Only the sound of the wheels of the mine's electric plant was still panting.</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the moon of the eighteenth or nineteenth of the lunar calendar climbed up from behind the Great Coal Mountain, and its snow-white light, like silver, covered the mountains and the earth. An unfortunate event occurred that caused the entire valley to stir in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>After a loud noise, wisps of thick smoke and flames emerged from the underground chimney leading to the mountain, and a frantic cry came from the underground up the hillside.</p>
<p>In the village, on the streets, everyone who had already fallen asleep was awakened by the loud noise. They rubbed their sleepy eyes and looked at the chimney spewing flames and thick smoke, surprised, waiting for the news from there. But everyone knew in their hearts that an unfortunate event had occurred.</p>
<p>"The steam pipe exploded, and a fire broke out underground."</p>
<p>After the news spread, a shocking sound rang out in the valley. In the moonlight, the surrounding fields and streets were filled with thousands upon thousands of figures, groups of people surrounding the entrance and exit of the mine. In just a moment, a circle of people had surrounded the area.</p>
<p>Cries, roars, shouts, all kinds of mixed sounds, were in a chaotic mess on the hillside.</p>
<p>The whistle wailed with a long, strange cry, and the rescue team brought by the train from Wulibridge arrived. The train broke through the crowd and drove into the platform.</p>
<p>Old Cheng was caught in the crowd and jumped off the train. His heart was beating, his hands were trembling, and he rushed towards the iron gate.</p>
<p>"Heavens, I only have this one son left. The eldest died here, the second also died here, now, now must he also die here?"</p>
<p>Old Cheng stood by the iron gate, covered in sweat, his voice trembling as he shouted.</p>
<p>The flames were still rising from underground, and the shouts were still stirring on the hillside. It wasn't until dawn that the valley returned to a peaceful world.</p>
<h3>Random Words from Xuezai</h3>
<p>— Xue Er</p>
<p>I like autumn, but it seems a little odd to get sick in this lovely season. I am a very cautious person, never greedy for cold or chewing ice in summer, and I close the windows every night after the beginning of autumn. But for the sake of doctors, if everyone were so cautious and didn't get sick, wouldn't these talents manufactured in medical schools ruin the world? Although I have never consulted a doctor when I get sick: because I know that getting sick is not necessarily terrible, and being able to rest quietly for a few days is a right uniquely enjoyed by patients. If you call a doctor as soon as you get sick, and the medicine works immediately, then getting sick is too meaningless; besides, patients who seek medical treatment and take medicine also kick the bucket.</p>
<p>I have been sick for four days, and I can't tell the difference between morning and evening every day. When I'm happy, I close my eyes and sleep, and when I wake up, I look around. This small room, although I have lived in it for a full two years, now that I am sick in bed, I have discovered many things that I didn't notice before. For example, the ceiling, I usually don't even bother to look up at it, but now it is the first thing my eyes touch, and I see that the place where the plaster is peeling off looks very much like a bridge. Thinking of the bridge, I remember the story of the Magpie Bridge meeting, and the two black shapes in the corners have become two figures; one is the cowherd who leads the cow, and the woman-like one can naturally be said to be the Weaver Girl. I look at them every day, and I can even count the number of magpies clearly, and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl also look like they are crying. This kind of great discovery only happens when you are sick.</p>
<p>The walls and doors seem to be seen every day, but once you get sick, you often rely on a pair of eyes. What you usually see as a dog can become a cat at this time, and no one argues with you, freedom of speech is achieved on the sickbed, isn't this a uniquely enjoyed right?</p>
<p>After talking for so long, it all refers to minor illnesses, and readers should not misunderstand. If you get a major illness, you can basically treat him as dead: because all of a person's rights have been deprived long ago, so where does this unique enjoyment come from? However, I have a minor illness, and if it doesn't get better in four more days, it will definitely get better in four more days; otherwise, it would really be a little odd.</p>

<h3>A Major Event in Five Families Town (8)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Now Father Fu went inside and came out saying that his wife was willing to allocate the pollen field to Fu Sheng, but was ridiculed by Elder Master Wu like this. Madam Zhu didn't teach her husband any more words, and Father Fu naturally couldn't answer.</p>
<p>For a moment, it became silent, and the noisy sound of cicadas was sent into the hall again.</p>
<p>Behind the hall, Zhu Quangui and his two young nephews peeked and disappeared. Father Fu was standing inside, and he could see clearly. Just now, he was called in and scolded by his wife, saying that a man had no ability to speak, and as soon as he opened his mouth, he was covered by Elder Master Wu. Now, wouldn't it be bouncing around if his old uncle went to report this stalemate? Thinking of this, Father Fu didn't know how to answer. He kept rubbing his hands, and sweat was streaming down from both sides of his forehead and temples. He subconsciously raised his narrow sleeves to wipe it away; he completely forgot that this sky-blue summer cloth garment was specially made for the examination that year, and it was rare to wear it out at ordinary times.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other in the same way, feeling that this matter had reached the most important juncture; even those who wanted to open their mouths were afraid that a word would ruin the overall situation. However, Elder Master Wu, who followed his lead, leisurely raised his water pipe and smoked, and Zhang Defu mustered his courage several times to urge Elder Master Wu to say something decisive, so that he could put this matter down, but fearing that he would fall short, he did not prolong the current stalemate in the suffocating atmosphere.</p>
<p>Zhu Quangui's head appeared again behind the hall, and he waved to his brother-in-law to ask him to go in. Father Fu deliberately lowered his head and pretended not to see it, he couldn't stand the internal and external attacks anymore. Like everyone else, he hoped that Elder Master Wu would pronounce his guilt.</p>
<p>In fact, Elder Master Wu was not really smoking his water pipe, he was using this space to plan the strategy for settling the case. Because he was the judge of Five Families Town, his words could not be arbitrary. Otherwise, he would lose his position and power in the town.</p>
<p>"Fu Ming," he slowly opened his mouth, "you have nothing to say, have you? This matter is your fault. Think about it, your second brother has been dead for more than ten years. Based on the lives of their mother and son, they have taken on so many debts: even if it's the several wars and famine years you mentioned, it shouldn't be less than the number passed down by the previous generations..." Elder Master Wu paused, raised his feather fan and waved it gently, "Now that the nephew's wife is willing to fill the pollen field, I won't bother with anything about the fields being ruined or not. It's just that the debts incurred when Fu Sheng married are not many, you return them to your sister-in-law in their original form, and you will be worthy of your deceased second brother. What do you all think?" At the end, he raised his head and asked the suspicious masses.</p>

<h3>Suicide of an Actress</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>Because of a face so similar to Garbo's</p>
<p>Imitation without an independent character, it is not necessarily in Hollywood, but there is no foothold in any place. When people call you the Chinese Norma Shearer, or the Oriental Laurel and Hardy, don't be happy. Let me tell you about a recent tragedy in Hollywood - the suicide of an actress, because her face, movements, and style were all too similar to Garbo's. This actress, named Sigrun Solvason, put on her favorite silk pajamas one night, held a champagne glass in her hand, poured some poison into it, sat in front of the mirror and looked at herself for a while, then raised the glass and greeted Death, raised her neck and drank the poisoned wine. It wasn't until two days later that the neighbors, because they hadn't seen the lovely girl for a long time, went to knock on her door. Unexpectedly, after knocking for a long time, no one answered, so they felt strange and reported it to the police. Later, they opened her door and went in to see that the hostess was already dead. Her suicide note was found elsewhere, and there was a sentence in it: "Only one in a million passes." This was a kind of tragic wailing at the time of her death after taking the medicine.</p>
<p>Let me tell you again, Sigrun's death had no other complicated reasons. She was not constrained by economics, because her wealthy husband loved her deeply and provided her with financial resources as much as possible. She had no love disputes, because she was wholeheartedly devoted to movies and had no other hobbies. The only reason she died was because she looked too much like the Swedish star Greta Garbo, and Hollywood called her Garbo's double. She learned to dress like Garbo, she learned the posture of Garbo on the screen or in private life, and she even learned Garbo's rough voice. When she walked on the road, no first-time visitor to Hollywood didn't think she was the real Garbo. She had proven acting talent. But she couldn't stand in Hollywood. Because she had a fanatical passion for imitating Garbo, which led to her ruining her own future and life. Many famous directors had advised her: "You should still work hard to be recognized by the public yourself! Don't imitate Garbo. Hollywood can only accommodate one Garbo, and only recognizes one Garbo. If you show your true colors alone, your future is unlimited." But she couldn't listen, it's really a pity.</p>
<p>Sigrun's life was different from the average woman who came to Hollywood to try her luck. She was born in Winnipeg, Canada. Although she was a small family jasper, she was famous for her beauty since childhood. After she grew up, she met a very famous miner and married him. The miner's name was Hersel, and he had a company in San Francisco. The place where they got married was San Francisco. If the Swedish female star had not come to the United States for a long time, she would still be living a stable life as Mrs. Hersel. Unfortunately, the famous Swedish director Still brought Garbo to the United States, and her photos were published in newspapers all over the United States. So Sigrun's general friends all complimented her, saying that the Swedish girl was no different from her. Sigrun was also moved when she heard it. She often said to herself: "Garbo has succeeded. What she can do, I can also do. Can she succeed, and I can't succeed?" So she wholeheartedly wanted to go to Hollywood.</p>
<p>Hersel couldn't resist his wife's wishes, so he agreed to send her to Hollywood. He also specially prepared extremely luxurious luggage for her to help her become famous in one fell swoop, rented a fashionable residence for her in Hollywood, and opened a bank account for her. In this way, such a rich wife came to Hollywood, the global film capital, in a grand manner. At first, she only did some extra roles, but the general directors valued her very much, especially Cecil B. DeMille, who assigned her small roles in "The Affairs of the Palace" and the recent "Cleopatra". Her husband's financial resources were constantly supplied, but he secretly prayed that she could wake up one day and not have to make a living under the spotlight. He also specially bought a piece of land for her in the mountains near Hollywood and built a house in order to establish her position. Later, she felt that the place was too far away, and it was inconvenient for a woman to live alone, so her husband bought her another house in a fashionable residential area in Hollywood. This made her one of the richest extras. Unfortunately, the fashionable residence that her husband finally bought for her became the place where his beloved wife died.</p>
<p>She didn't rely on acting to maintain her life, so she didn't care whether the company had work or not assigned to her. However, because she looked too much like Garbo, she was willing to get a role equal to Garbo's without counting wages. But, as mentioned above, Hollywood can only accommodate one Garbo, and only recognizes one Garbo, her existence is superfluous and unnecessary. Sleepless nights, tossing and turning on the embroidered couch, suddenly awakened, but it was too late, she thought to herself. So her usual arrogance forced her onto the only path.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>A Critique of "Spoiled Children"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Social Register || Cathay</p>
<p>Quite similar to the works of the May Fourth era, the stage play adaptation of "Spoiled Children" ultimately lags behind the times.</p>
<p>The original authors, John Emerson and Anita Loos, spared no effort in attacking the sins of the wealthy. Here, they oppose the corrupt notion of the son's mother, the idea that a young master cannot be with a woman of lower status, which they deem unreasonable. Thus, they depict the mother bribing a cowardly youth with a ten thousand dollar check to break up her son's marriage, and even more arrogantly offering her son's lover a generous sum of fifteen thousand dollars, believing that money can buy anything. In this aspect, they are actively satirizing the wealthy. At the same time, on the other hand, they give great sympathy to the naive and unrestrained woman. They make her feel constrained among the gentlemen and ladies, portray her as not understanding the etiquette of noble people, and further depict her drinking freely with servants in underground rooms, even dancing unrestrainedly after getting drunk. From these places, every aspect reveals her naivety. Moreover, she is very compassionate, willing to pawn her diamond bracelet for her friend pretending to have lung disease, and even tending to his illness day and night. In these areas, she gains the audience's sympathy. Thus, in the end, she tears up the check for more than ten thousand dollars and loudly scolds the mother's immorality. Finally, she marries the young master after all. And on the other hand, the young master, who usually spends money like dirt, is portrayed as a good person; for the sake of love, he can condescend to marry a singer, and he truly falls in love with that singer.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this play is a cliche in every way. From the choice of subject matter to the decision of the theme, there is no place that can keep up with the times. But as said earlier, the author does indeed satirize the lives of gentlemen and ladies, such as when four people of different heights, builds, and weights are invited to sing at a banquet, and they sing vulgar songs like "Three Blind Mice," and their ugly attitudes are fully exposed in public. But is this a conscious exposure, or is it merely something that must be done to bring the lovers together? Isn't the young master's mother ashamed and tearful after being scolded by the singer? And at the same time, the young master's father is a good person, and the old man, Jonah, is also an upright gentleman. From these observations, it is not difficult for us to fully understand the authors. At most, they are just early bourgeois minds, timid liberals with a slight understanding of society.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, a progressive screenwriter would never adapt such a work. However, ordinary vulgar American screenwriters are most fond of grabbing such existing stories. From the standpoint of the supremacy of love, this kind of thing is most suitable for their tastes. Therefore, we feel that the American film movement seems to be frozen in ideological struggle, and on the contrary, they desperately film works that are beneficial to the bourgeoisie. In this sense, "Spoiled Children" is still something beneficial to them. Isn't the yellow deception, allowing a poor woman to marry a young master, helping the existence of the current system?</p>
<p>Furthermore, when it comes to the form of expression, we are not wrong in saying that from the director's techniques to the actors' performances, they cannot keep up with the height of technology that a few Americans have already reached. Obviously, the personalities of the characters cannot be grasped, and it makes those seeking entertainment feel dull. As for the female lead, it's difficult for her to play the role of a young girl. Coleen Moore was once a red star a few years ago, but due to the passage of time, she is not enough to satisfy the audience.</p>

<h3>United Flower Sidelines</h3>
<p>Wu Yonggang is one of the most talented set designers in the Chinese film industry. He has rich experience and beautiful ideas. He has made many contributions to the sets of United Flower's previous productions. Recently, a script he wrote, "The Goddess," has been sent to Beijing for registration, and he will direct this film himself in the future.</p>
<p>Fei Mu, who rose to fame with "Night in the City" and shocked the film industry with "Life," has created another terrifying masterpiece, "Fragrant Snow Sea." After the director devoted himself to hard work, this play will soon be completed. Those who know say that when "Fragrant Snow Sea" comes out, the Chinese film industry and film art lovers across the country will be greatly surprised, because this play uses many creative techniques, and the story is written in a unique way, surpassing the two films "Night in the City" and "Life."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaofeng, who is in charge of the continuity of "Fragrant Snow Sea," is a graduate of a fisheries school. He is very fond of film art and is willing to study hard, so although he has never appeared on the screen, his colleagues already know that he is extremely talented in film. This time, in Ma-Xu Weibang's new work, "Heaven and Hell," it has been decided to give him a chance. But before the filming had even started, he suddenly fell ill and died. Everyone mourned him very much. Especially Ma-Xu and Fei Mu, who took care of everything for him day and night, from his falling ill and being hospitalized to his funeral. But even so, they will forever be saddened by the loss of such a talented and promising person!</p>
<p>The comedy "Lucky Star," recently directed by Zhu Shilin, is entirely dubbed with singing. There is a laundry song in this play, sung by Han Langen, Liu Jiqun, Wang Moqiu, etc., and they sing it in different ways several times.</p>

<h3>Contending for Love and Getting a Child (Doctor Monica) (10)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>John took a telegram out of Monica's pocket. Monica said, "That telegram arrived this morning." John opened it, read it, and then frowned, saying, "What's wrong? What's going on?" Monica looked at her husband's face and said, "I'm thinking of going to Vienna." John didn't understand and said, "Vienna?" Monica looked at the vast expanse of lake water in front of her and slowly said, "That's right. My plan for that fitted house seems to be going ahead. If it goes ahead, I will be a proactive person. I have to work in Vienna for a year to succeed." John seemed very angry and said, "Why didn't I know anything about this beforehand? This is a bolt from the blue." Monica glanced at her husband and asked, "Are you willing to let me go?" John said, "What's wrong? Maybe I'll go with you." He lit a cigarette and took a puff, and then said, "But why didn't you give me any warning beforehand? Or do you want me to go with you, right?" Monica still asked with a probing tone, "Are you really going?" John thought for a moment and said, "In another six weeks, my book will be finished. How much time do you have left?" Monica leaned her head on John's shoulder and said, "Let's not talk about that. Let's watch the sunset." After she finished speaking, she raised her hand. John looked at the crystal watch she was wearing on her wrist, which he had bought for her that day. Monica asked, "Do you remember the night you bought it back?" John nodded. Monica said again, "That night, you made me believe that you loved me very much." John hugged her tightly, frowned, and said, "I really love you deeply. What I wanted you to know that night was that your position is irreplaceable." Monica said with a kind of joy that John did not understand, her voice trembling, "John! Do you really think so?" John said, "I still think so now." Monica said; "John, there you go again." John blamed her and said, "Don't you know?" Monica turned around and pressed her head tightly against John's chest, as if it wasn't close enough. The sun set, and they were still lingering in the vast lake.</p>
<p>Monica's true intention, John may still not be able to guess, but Anna, after watching her hurriedly pack things all afternoon, understood half of it. She managed to get John out of the house, and then asked the maid to make tea for her. Then she walked up to Monica and asked straight to the point, "Tell me, I've been suspecting for a long time. Are you going to separate from John forever?" Monica hesitated for a moment, and then stammered, "Well, yes." Anna snorted and said, "That's a good idea. I'm afraid you'll write him a letter when you get to Vienna." Monica said, "The letter has already been written." Anna said, "Monica, why don't you listen to what he has to say?" Monica said, "What's the use? Let's not talk about it." Anna insisted, "I mean, for John's sake, you should openly and honestly explain it to him." Monica sighed upon hearing this, sat down on the bed, and then said, "Anna, please don't interfere." At this time, John walked to the door and asked, "What's wrong? What's the matter?" Anna said, "Nothing. Just a little nervous. I'll get her some water to drink." She walked to the door and whispered to John, "Go in and cherish her." (To be continued)</p>
