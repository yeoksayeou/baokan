<p>時評</p>
<h3>美屬夏威夷改邦之意義·廷</h3>
<p>昨聞夏威夷派往華盛頓國會代表提議。將該處改邦。記者寄寓其地。再易寒暑。見聞較詳。深知該案意義之重大。因草本文以告國人。</p>
<p>一八九八年七月七日。美國參衆兩院聯席决議合併夏威夷羣島。該羣島居太平洋中心。形勢險要。美人合併後。積極經營。不遺餘力。其首府火奴魯魯附近之珍珠港。爲世界最大軍港之一。而期哥菲爐陸軍軍營之規模。亦稱全美第一。故美人多有稱之爲西部第一道防綫者。美人重視夏威夷如此。宜不應長此以屬地目之。何改邦之舉。遲遲至今尙未實現耶。曰個中主要關鍵。蓋在日美之邦交。而欲加說明。又不可不略言美國殖民地之性質。</p>
<p>據美國歷史往例。凡一殖民地加入版圖後。因人數太少。面積太小。人民敎育程度亦不足以言自治時。則目之爲附庸。如塞慕亞羣島瓜姆島等皆是。如殖民地形勢衝要。或有相當之面積人口。但其人民與環境仍未至如其理理之自治程度時。則稱之曰屬地Territory。附庸與屬地皆直接受聯邦中央政府之統治。但屬地又有結合的Incorporaated與非結合的Non_inccrporated之分。結合的屬地。在國内法上爲合衆國之整個的部分。一遇時機成熟。國會卽願收爲聯邦之一。在未改邦前。人民一般享有聯邦憲法之保障與權利。屬地旣經結合之後。永遠不能脫離。卽總統與國會亦無權准其擺脫中央政府之覊絆。非結合的屬地則不然。人民並不享有聯邦憲法之一切權利與保障。在國内法上亦不成爲合衆國之整個的部分。故總統與國會有權准其獨立。今日美總統與國會可以准令菲列濱限期獨立。而不能令夏威夷阿拉斯加獨立。理由在此。因人民享受聯邦憲法權利範圍之不同。故在菲列濱出生者。除美人之子女外。僅稱美國之「人民」National（人民二字。係記者杜撰。幸勿以亂憲意。）而在夏威夷出者。皆美國之公民Citizen也。</p>
<p>夏威夷旣爲一結合的屬地。而直隸於華盛頓中央政府。故總督由總統委派。並非由當地民選。總督對於民選立法機關之議决案。得提交複議。而複議範圍。且可自由斟酌。行政立法雙方。互相制衡。以執行政務。</p>
<p>何以謂該地改邦之主要關鍵。在於日美之邦交。曰。夏威夷羣島。面積六四四九英里。現有人口約四十餘萬。而日本移民及其後裔。獨佔十餘萬。約當全數三分之一。據美國國籍法原則。及夏威夷在憲法上之地位。凡出生於合衆國者。無論其血統何屬。一般稱爲公民。故日人「土生」子女。一屆法定年齡。便有選舉權被選舉權及其他種種公民權利。美國爲新興國家。國内所包羅之民族分子。最稱複雜。「土生」日種子女。旣受憲法之保障。任何人皆不能驅之於境外。或靳其公民權利而不予。但依日本國籍法。若輩固仍爲日本公民。初不因出生地點而異其身份。跨籍問題。於焉發生。近來夏威夷「土生」日人自動聲明脫離日藉者。雖時有所聞。然以總數爲比例。則微乎其微。</p>
<p>設「土生」日人甚易於爲美同化。或日本之立國精神不侵略他人爲能事。則爲美人計。誠亦無所用其惶恐憂懼。無如東西民族各有個性。物以類聚人亦有然。火奴魯魯素以人種洪爐自豪。而黄晳界限。劃然可見。夫莘莘學子。或則天眞未鑿。或則涉世未深。當最無種族爾我之偏見者也。然嘗遊乎其地最高學府。深覺各種族間之門户界畛。依然未泯。滿案旣起。輿論譁然。每一論及挺身吭聲爲日方辯護故作違心之論者。皆寬袖木屐兒之子若孫也。日人團結甚强。與異族中人鮮有婚媾。以前加州日僑。積蓄羡餘。思有室家之好。則向國内設法覓得年齡相當之女子照片。悅則出資迎來同居。夏威夷日人旣多。互通婚媾。自更輕而易舉。當地公立學校之授課時間。大槪自上午八時至下午二時。而日文學校卽自下午三時至五時授課。各日校設備周詳。規則嚴肅。執敎鞭者。多聘自日本。且聞有下級軍官混跡其間。僅以敎學爲標榜。而别有所懷抱者。「土生」日種子女。無一不能日語。亦無一不諳日文。年前地方當局。曾擬實行取締。日人反響大起。案涉憲法解釋。經大理院判决。敎讀自由。不能剥奪。當局敗訴。忍氣吞聲。無可奈何。日人虔佛甚篤。夏威夷各島。寺院林立。善男信女。頂禮膜拜勿衰。信敎自由。憲文明定。亦無從干涉。試探視當地日人家庭。布置設備。無一不酷肖其國内人家。天皇皇后之肖像。往往赫然在望。首接於賓客眼簾之前。散步於通衢狹巷。大小店肆。由日人經營者。又十七八焉。置身其間。與扶桑三島。幾無稍殊。現狀如此。美人惴惴不安。固不足怪。矧日人處心積慮。久圖一逞。目光四燭。太平洋海權之爭奪。舍美以外。無足當意者。記者嘗經歷巴拿馬運河美管地帶。曁加州之桑港羅省。目擊日人勢力之散布。亦無孔不入。美人未嘗不引爲腹心之患。蓋一旦發生警耗。抵禦外敵之侵襲猶易。防止内部之搗亂實難。是則不待兩國正式交鋒。而禍起蕭墻。已有不堪設想者。自九一八事變後。美人戒備倍嚴於平時。火奴魯魯晚霞重疊中。時見電炬四射。光芒交叉。紅綠燈數碗。隱約閃爍。如寒星之移動。有物鼓盪靜空大氣。微響軋軋。蓋美海陸軍用飛機之練飛夜航也。目的何在。可不待言矣。記者又聞以駐兵二萬人之斯哥菲爐軍營。竟無一「土生」日人服務其間。則美人之防護周密。又可想見一斑。</p>
<p>凡此所述。皆在借以闡明夏威夷改邦之意義。而繼定其不易實現。良以改邦後。總督與立法機關。皆歸民選。近年日種居民。非土生或無選舉權者。爲數尙多。故選舉期内。尙不能舉足輕重。但其勢力之膨脹。已堪驚人。不數年後。今日未成年之青年子女。皆將陸續抵達選舉年齡。愈久而愈多。勢非操縱選舉不止。且在華盛頓參衆兩院中。改邦後將有正式夏威夷議員多人出席。與今日僅有出席權而無表决權之代表一人相比較。權力懸殊。亦不可同日而語。是則日人勢力。且將深入於聯邦政府。而不以夏威夷片隅爲限矣。屆時中央政府因聯邦政制及憲法關係。必將束手無策。蓋一屬地改邦可。一邦重降而爲屬地則不可。以事屬違憲故也。</p>
<p>現制。夏威夷總縣雖由總統委派。經參議院同意。而其人選。須依法以曾在當地居住滿三年者爲限。去年羅斯福總統。曾咨請國會。准其自由派人。不受上述之限制。但該案通過衆院後卽在參院擱淺。羅氏咨請改制之直接動機何若。固不必論。而其意欲使夏威夷與中央政府之關係。格外接近。則固昭然若揭。今夏威夷代表麥肯德里斯氏。意欲提議改邦。以實行與中央分庭抗禮。顯與羅氏之意背道而馳。在今日日美邦交一張一弛舉棋不定之會。其不能輕易成功。更可斷言也　　當美國合併夏威夷時。日人曾以破壞太平洋現局爲藉口。而提出抗議。美人寗至健忘。在過去三十六年中。時時可以改邦。而改邦之舉未實現。一般美人。方將額手稱慶之不暇。安肯在今日而貿然出此。依記者推測。麥氏因當選代表後。仍爱鹿於總督一席。頗招物議。此次毅然提出改邦議案。或者在挽回一部分之之心。正未可知。然萬一因不可思議之理由。該案竟至成爲法律。則太平洋之局面。又將起一重大變化。吾人愼勿以事屬美國内政而忽視之也。</p>

<h3>日本外交政策的轉向</h3>
<p>日本通信</p>
<p>＝東和美國北拒蘇聯＝</p>
<p>＝南窺澳洲西伺中國＝</p>
<p>日本自侵略滿洲得手之後、軍事上的勝利、可以說是到達頂點、但是幣原的恊調外交、内田的焦土外交、都不能不說是失敗了、日本匪但在遠東陷於孤立、在世界上也有孤立的情勢、退出國聯以後、太平洋的黯淡風雲、自然更加黯淡、日美關係、一天一天的惡化、日英之間、爲了爭奪棉製品市塲、又發生很大的裂痕、日蘇兩國、當然祇有極露骨的相互利用的外交、絕没有誠意諒解的可能、對中國不待言是一種敷衍、無所謂親交了、現世界一般的情勢、經濟聯盟的積極醖釀之外、政浥同蠟的趨勢、又非常嚴重、然則像日本現時這種到處表現其獨霸勢力的外交、有那一個强國、肯聽他的軍力指揮呢、因此、他纔改變他的外交手法、撤回他的焦土餐交同時更暗示他的軍國主義的行動也不是不可以讓步的、廣田上台、就標榜道義外交、尤其有重要的引誘物、是由東洋門羅主義轉變而爲門户開放、卽滿洲的門户、也承認開放、并且歡迎外國人去投資、更給與極優惠的條件、美國資本、尤其是觀迎的、在事實上大家都知道日本的重工業很幼穉、更開發滿洲、他有點力量不足、何况他將大部分的實力、都運用到軍事上或軍需工業上去、在産業開發的力量、當然也就微小了、於是他就需求外資的援助、不過照過去的情形、日本對列國的經濟戰爭、會因外交對立嚴重而更見激劇、更談不至所謂外國在日本勢力支配之下的投資問題了、</p>
<p>經過日本外交界·財閥·軍閥·幾番研究之後、計劃好打開外产我出路的步驟、（一）高倡其國防充實、豫備建造有力的補功艦隊、同時提出英美日的海軍比率、應該平等的說法、凖備作對美的交换條件、（二）先行打開日美間的外交僵持局面然後再設法對付英國、（三）對蘇聯務必持穩愼態度、最重要的是破壞美蘇間的政治諒解、假如美國眞肯確實表示、不在政治上援助蘇聯的話、日本亦呆提出相當的條件以相交換、</p>
<p>以上這些原則决定之後、齋藤博以青年外交家拜大使之命赴美、多方面與美國當局接洽、特别是民主黨方面的人、自齋藤與赫爾互换公文發表以後、日美兩國將繼續作比較接觸於實際事情的談判、美國方面、要提出怎樣的實際條件、此間尙未有所確知、在日本方面所預備的、是海軍比率平等、要美國允在遠東不設車港和不駐大艦隊·與承認日本現在已作成的事實·作交換、如果美國認爲不滿、則日本可以提出滿洲的門户開放爲補充、這一點日本當局自身、爭持得很厲害、不過後來都承認、因現在日本的政治實力、足以支配東北四省、他可以運用政治力量、制限著美國經濟的活動、據日本方面的推測、美國是可以接收日本提議的、對澳洲的事、當然要牽聯到英國、日本很想乘機打破英國及其自治領殖民地的經濟聯盟、所以他拚命拉攏亞洲非洲各小國的皇族與土著民的代表、若要日本承認英帝國的經濟聯盟、則英國就該用最優互惠來相交換、關於蘇聯、日本近來很認識他外交手段的敏活、所以先從外交上削弱蘇聯、然後再從事於實力的鬥爭、此刻日本對蘇、是採取和緩政策、對華則暫時不用武力、多在交際上努力、以轉旋從前的國民間的惡感、對内蒙現在也是如此、總之他的主旨、一則是避免國際關係之再惡化、再則借此以遂行其軍事的便利、（三月二十五日於東京）</p>

<h3>看守所中李淑芸病殆</h3>
<p>自劉倬民案發生後、牽涉民政廳長辜仁發夫人李淑芸、及其母劉氏、一併補捕、解錫讯押等情、已迭誌本報、惟該辜廳長宣稱、李淑芸尙有賣官詐財情事、日前並由民政廳將證據八件呈省轉送縣法院考證、茲悉該項證據、僅爲片面之詞、難作信讞、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>證據内容</h3>
<p>該項證據八件之内容、因事關機密、一時難得眞相、經記者多方設法、昨據省垣消息、該項證據、大都均屬第三者之控告、文件僅爲片面之詞、難作信讞、故檢察處認爲證據未足、亦卽在此、惟此中有收據二紙、爲淑芸所書、係由上海水警第一區通轄之鈞和鑑鑑長黄某所告發者、其收條一爲便箋所書、原文謂「今收到王先生交來達岸寄來大洋一百元此據、」一爲名片所書、原文謂「達岸收洋一百元」此項欵項、係距今一月前、由黄鑑長分兩次送往鎭江辜公館、經淑芸給據收下、惟鑑長姓黄、收條上書王、是否筆誤、抑係淑芸代廳長收欵、而不知鑑長姓别、此點殊堪研究、而兩條語氣、一則「達岸寄來」一則謂「達岸收洋」此點亦堪研究、設此欵果係淑芸冒廳長之名而收受之不法賄略、則黄鑑長行賄之罪、須與得賄同樣處刑、難逃法網、</p>
<h3>淑芸病危</h3>
<p>李淑芸因受刺激過重、在獄數次咯血後、體質日益虛弱、據張子每醫生談、淑芸病狀、殊堪危險、因其先天異常孱弱、以前起居安適、已養成嬌貴之結習、現在獄中、空氣惡濁、食品粗陋、更因受刺激過深、飲食不進、終日哭泣、故勢將不支、除再困處獄中半月、預測健康、影響甚深、或有生命危險云云、前日淑芸胞弟槐生、（十八歲在南京五卅中學讀書）隻身來錫、赴獄探望母姊、相見痛哭、略談片刻、卽匆匆離所乘車赴京、現淑芸對辜仁發在報端登載之啓事、將有所聲辯、並親自在獄撰泣告全國同　胞書、將與辜訂婚結婚及發覺重婚與此次被捕之詳情、和盤托出、原文請律師修改後、遍登全國各大報、</p>
<h3>捕李原因</h3>
<p>昨日立法委員黄一毆、又對往訪之記者、發表談話、略謂是日徐樸诚劉安熙到余處搜捕李淑芸、謂其有工産嫌疑、而習日民廳派徐樸誠迎提淑芸之公文上、則又稱聞法捕房捕獲、故派警迎提等語、前後矛盾、此中眞相、定别有用意、黄氏又云、南京各方面對於此案、認爲辜仁發實太荒唐、因其個人私人、牽同大局、殊爲痛心、監察院以辜有玷官箴、提出彈劾、確有此議、嗣因本案已歸司法辦理、司法爲神聖的、當秉公辦理、故短時期内、暫不有所表現、靜待無錫法院辦理後定奪、繼黄氏又云、卽使淑芸有唆使劉倬民抗交及招搖納賄情事、則何又累共老母、老實的把此案透澈的說一句、李淑芸的所以被捕、那裏是單獨因招搖納賄、是另有目的的、所以前日無錫縣法院開庭、淑芸因病重請求交保、官謂外面恐没有看守所裏面安穩委當、李認其言甚善、故仍還押、由此可見無法院對本案眞相、已明瞭矣云云、</p>
<h3>控辜重婚</h3>
<p>關於李淑芸之辯訴狀、已由巢堃律師撰狀、現送交章士釗律師處修改、訴辜重婚　節、亦附於辯訴書内、暫時不投、候辜廳長到庭時投遞、據巢律師談話、報載辜廳長談話有「余爲一行政長官、以行政長官檢舉一罪犯、而必須長官去對質、則行政長官將不勝其煩」等語、殊不知行政長官、檢舉屬員、自可不必到庭、今辜廳長檢舉其夫人、以丈夫地位檢舉其妻、非與普通之長官檢舉屬員可比、自應有到庭對質之義務云云、至於辜之第一夫人艾承枚、在江寗地方法院控辜重婚一節、報紙消息互歧、茲悉艾女士因辜廳長公然對外宣稱本人業已離婚、顯屬有意遺棄、且其對於李淑芸所施酷辣手腕、毒於蛇虺、狠於豺狼、尤足令人寒心、弱女子將人人自危、故已延請律師向江寗地方法院控辜重婚遺棄、現江寗地方法院正在依法進行中、又悉李淑芸病狀、昨（三十）日稍有轉機、其醫生之診斷書云」刻診脈略和緩、米湯稍進、神氣較好、大府已通、尙不甚多、昨夜又復吐出紫塊、此刻熱度降度、九十九度、舌苔少化、痰亦少、下腹撑、再從肝胃平治」、</p>

<h3>憲草平議（三））續（·章·淵·若</h3>
<p>（八）地方制度</p>
<p>甲、省丨省制問題、至爲複雜、年來改造之議、甚囂塵上、或主縮小省區、或主廢省併縣、顧此種勇敢的立法、是否爲目前政治的情勢所許可、殊成問題、且於事前不爲必要的凖備、不作切實的計劃、則此種勇敢的立法、是否能行之而有效、行之而無弊、尤應加以最先之考慮、愚於拙著現代憲政論、地方制度一章中、曾斟酌情勢、有减低省權勵行縣洽之主張、茲姑不贅、今僅於憲草條文、略作評述而已、</p>
<p>一三○條以省爲中央直接管轄之行政區域直接二字、實爲病語、揣起草者之本意、蓋因省非地方、故祇得爲此種奇特之規定也、吾人之見、以爲吾國旣爲數千年來之大單一國、此種奇特的制度與組織、旣爲國情上所不必要、而在目前推行地方自治、企圖和平統一之時、此種不良而奇特的名稱、尤不應使之留於憲章、以免國民心理上發生不良的意識、循此理而論斷之、省之一章、實應劃入地方制度之中而定省爲高級地方自治區域、且第六章、中央與地方權限之劃分、亦僅有中央與地方之對稱、而未有省之一意、横梗其中也、</p>
<p>第一三三條、缺陷頗多、一、省參議會、旣可以選舉省長、何無罷免之權、二、向立法院提議關於省之法律案、省之立法、是否一一須請示中央、如曰然、則中央實際上又何能深明各省實際情形與需要、如曰不然、則憲草第六十二條、僅許地方制定單行法規、而省則未有規定也、三、省參議會、旣有操縱省政之大權、然省參議會、如僣省長有所衝突、此中關係、究應如何調處、省參議會一理專横、又如何救濟、並無規定、實屬危險、　　第一三五條、規定軍人非解除軍職三年後、不得爲省長候選人、頗合愚見）註十七（惟一三四條、對於省長究應向何方負責、向中央乎、向省民乎、均無規定、一旦省長專横、如何制裁、且省長不由中央任命、又與一三○條之立法精神、有所矛盾、而事實上、中央因此將不能直接指揮、倘不謀有效之救濟方法、則一三六條所謂省長受中央之指揮、不將成爲空想乎、</p>
<p>復次、省旣監督地方自治、然而省縣關係、並未規定、則果將如何行使共監督之權乎、將來必滋困難也、復觀一三六條之規定、省之職權、空洞無物、此愚已於前文論中央地言權限一節中、有所論及矣、</p>
<p>乙、縣丨縣爲自治之單位、實爲發揚民權、完成寳政、以及發展國民生計之基礎、前歲國民會議、制定約法之際、愚曾草約法眞詮一文、布諸本報、卽着重此點、此次憲草第一四○條、對於縣自治事項、規定特詳、頗合愚意、惟此種複雜繁重之事項、果將如何得而實施、首賴有充裕之財源、過去各縣收入、大都爲省所朘削、凡各縣之雜捐、其收入豐富者、悉攫歸省庫、（註十八故今後究應如何防止省之朘削、確保各縣材源、實與今後縣政之改造與推進、有最密切之關係、負制憲之責者、似亦有注意之必要也、</p>
<p>（九）餘論</p>
<p>一、關於憲法之保障者丨現代憲法、對於憲法之保障、有獨立的機關、（另詳拙著現代憲政論）憲草於此、付之缺如、雖一五六條、有法律與本憲法抵觸者無效之規定、然如何方能無效科、非空洞一語有濟也、</p>
<p>二、關於憲法之修改者丨憲法之修改、固不應太難、亦不能太易、前者之弊、在不能合於時需、而易引起革命、後者之弊、在無以安定國家之秩序、提高國民對於憲於之信心、吾人之意、以爲憲法之修改、應分兩端、一部份應使得隨時修正與一部份基本原則、其應垂爲立國大計、舉國共信之極則者、則不能輕易修改也、</p>
<p>三、關於憲法之公布者丨一六○條規定、本憲法自頒布之日施行、吾國現在訓政、尙未完成、民權又甚幼稚、驟行公布憲法、實有拔苗助長、獵等以進之危、此則爲吾國今日憲政之基本問題、愚於此點、盤醒胸襟、頗有所感、容待他日、再申愚見、</p>

<p>之時、使日人相當讓步、蓋由於歐戰以後、國力之傷痍過甚、而歐洲内部之矛盾與糾紛、又日甚一日、致不能舉其全力以應付遠東事變、故國聯共同對日之失敗、非失敗於外交、而失敗於其十餘年來政治上所造成之局勢、是以吾人於顔大使在日内瓦運用之外交、不當論其成敗之迹象、而但當論其已否盡其最大之努力、以日人在國聯、躋於三强之列、操舉足重輕之勢、各國雖崇公理、而亦不敢過拂其意旨、松岡洋右、覇才洋溢、尤爲彼國所稱道、卒致失舉世之同情、不得不鍛羽而歸、此卽顔大使在日内瓦盡其最大之努力、吾人於山河破碎聲中、含淚盡其慰勞之忱者、主旨在此、吾人旣慰勞其過去、一方又不得不策勵其將來、敢以芻蕘之見、貢獻於顔大使者、蓋今日政府當局、所以屢次詔示於吾人者、曰此後祗有努力脩明内政、纔能講及外交、其意若謂、中國現時外交方面、無從努力、祗有暫時擱起不談、而先舉全力以脩明内政、但同時又謂、國力之充實、非旦夕可成、而外患則立時可以亡我、此兩說同出於政府之表示、而意義未免歧異、果如後一說、中國仍不能不講求外交因所謂脩明内政、充實國力者、至少亦當如蘇俄所謂之五年計劃、經過一相當時期、方有實力可以表現、但在此外患卽時可以亡我聲中、不能不於外交上運用方略、以圖自存、然後方有從容脩明内政之機、以蘇俄方、固俟五年計劃、告成以後、歐陸諸國、刮目而視、然後乘機訂結多邊之互不侵犯條約、以增進其國際地位、此與當局所謂先内政而後餐交之意相符、但同時就土耳其先例而論、當希臘進小亞細亞之際、非聯結蘇俄法意爲與國、以緩和希臘之壓迫、則土耳其或已淪爲殖民地、雖有凱末耳、亦無從展其治績、此内政外交應同時並重之先例也、吾國今日之情形、與蘇俄絕異、而與土耳其差同、譬諸人身患病、其病菌侵襲之速度、遠過亽其每日營養所得之效用、欲恃此以增加體力、抵抗病菌、萬不可期、則惟有先以藥物注射、阻止病菌之繁殖與進行、然後可以從容頣養、治國治病、其理一也、顔大使爲外交界之耆宿、此行摒擋私事以後、仍將駐節歐陸、盡其樽俎折衝之任務、故吾人所希望於顔大使者、勿以歐陸形勢之杌隉、勿以吾國内憂外患之交迫、而稍挫其高掌遠蹠之雄圖、蓋已往十年間、五人對於外交、崇尙空泛之理論、而未注重實際之形勢、以致瀋變一起、幾於無所措手、四省之淪陷、可謂十餘年來外交短視之結果、今後再以此種粗疏態度臨之、則斷送者非爲四省、而爲整個之民族、可以斷言、去外交界之職責、貴於　觀數十年後國際形勢之所趨、而制事於機先、其次亦應注重國際形勢之錯綜、於自身之利害奚若、而預圖所以消弭與補救、如果事至而應付、必至倉皇失措、吾披覽王芸生所記駐日汪使歸國時之談話、雖一鱗一爪、内容未能全部披露、已不勝其喟然太息、有昔人所謂「曲突徙薪」之感、以顔大使辦理對俄復交一事、縝密迅捷、知其對於國際形勢、必有深刻之觀察、在京在潯、定有嘉謨、貢諸當局、吾人惟望其能立予採用、垂爲國是、尤望其能以全權付諸顔大使、爲機敏之處置、俾外患稍紓、、有從容自振之機、實爲全國惟一之願望、今日敝會等此舉、本爲互推誠欵、商榷救亡之計、而非蹈襲尋常酬酢之故事、故策勉期許之詞、多於推崇稱道之詞、惟望顔大使能鑒其誠意、大加責備、並晉一觴、以祝顔大使此後繼續地爲全民族而奮門、</p>
<p>顔氏答詞　顔駿人大使起立答詞云、今天承諸位熱烈之招待、並聆主席王曉籟先生之一番宏論、實覺慚感交集、其實兄弟不過一個普通外交官、聊盡分内之職守、並無若何大貢獻、至於出席日内瓦、亦僅適逢其會而已、兄弟在大前年赴美、初僅代理性質、到美國甫二十餘天、卽得國府電促赴日内瓦、出席國聯、最初、我等卽引用國聯盟約第十一條共條文意義、全在和解、如兩國發生衝突、卽可據此調解、其　法並須得兩當事國之同意、始可生效、故當時無甚嚴厲辦法、於是我代表團乃决定改引十五條、然根據此條、仍須由行政院解决、其所異於十一條者、蓋可由行政院轉交大會討論、故市商會等十七團體公宴顔大使（啓昌照相館攝）</p>
<p>我等卽决提議、將基提交大會、雖爲他國所反對、亦仍力爭、而最後結果、卒在大會中、得諸小國之幫助、大會報告書、遂能有利於我、該報告書、係以李頓報告書爲根據資料、蓋以肯定之表示、東北事件、於我國雖甚重要、然歐洲諸邦、則不甚注意、及至上海戰爭發生、彼等以關係密切、乃態度改變、不復反對引用十五條、今日爲上海各團體之宴請、故予特於上海事件多說幾句、上海事變之發生、於各國影響極大、而其時又適逢籌備近十年之軍縮會議、將開大會、東亞大陸、却正在砲聲隆隆之下、彼等乃感覺矛盾滑稽之極、予對國聯略有不滿、因其並無切實之辦法、滬戰雖可得國聯議决案以爲根據、並得四大更强作保人以解决、但我方損失、賠償毫無、此實國聯不能令人滿意之處、然上海一戰、於我國地位身價、增加甚大、余等起初在日内瓦巷覺灰心、及至上海抵抗戰起、異常興奮、彼時各國報紙、均加頌揚、蓋以此役非僅軍隊抗戰、人民各方、均極熱烈聲助、足令外人認識我國民族精神也、在日内瓦時、更有一代表與予作如下之談話、以前諸列强、均以爲有二萬人卽可征服全中國、但自是以後、非十萬大兵不敢開到上海、但目前更有何國、能立卽出此重兵、以作侵人之舉、及來上海、又遇一西人銀行家、告予謂、從來未見中國人民有若此次之熱心、不但先生們努力參加工作、卽太太小姐們、亦各爭先恐後、踴躍輸將、勸募救護、故予對上海人士極深感謝、及後熱河事生、國際乃有此種諷刺之口吻、以以前中國所以不戰、可以藉口付託國聯、今旣得國聯之判决書、更將如何以四萬萬之巨靈大國、爲七十萬侏儒小邦所擊、未嘗稍事自衛、今熱河又將若何、此實令我們在外代表、所無可辯詰者、上海事件發生、因得國際之注意故在國聯辦理、結果較好、因上海事辦得較好、東軍亦可同樣援引、故亦受相當影響、在今晚宴會上、予可述幾點感覺、（一）此次中日爭端、世界輿論、一致對我表示同情、雖事實無補、然精神却興奮不少、（二）國際之幫助有限、如眞欲得國聯實際之幫助、須先亟謀自助始可、因國聯非太上機關、其最大作用不過和解、如和解無望、則事實上實難有他法、（三）有謂中日黄人衝突、何必在西人前打官司、前在北平辦餐交、亦頗有中日合作感想、我國文化、較早於日、舊居長兄之地位、得此時日全歐化、竟遠超我國、中爲農業國、日爲製造國、本有合作之可能、但日竟用武力强行壓迫、則我决不能甘居其下、故予望黄人能覺悟、能合作、免在白人前打官司、以遺笑異族、此後一二年、國事仍日在困頓中、然亦不必過事悲觀、如一病人、卽當郵危之際、亦當亟力設法、以謀死裏逃生、决不可坐以待斃、東北譬如手臂、手憪旣失、固感痛若極大、上海乃爲心臟、尤屬重要、故望諸君、以後更應急起努力設法、共同策謀拯救國家之道、予此次歸來、觀察數省、見國内各方、均頗有進步、故對國家前途、並不感到失望、不過上海爲交通輿論金融之中心、而諸君又皆各界之領袖、故望仍繼續努务、以求達到光大之前途云、</p>

<p>交部籌畫實施</p>
<h3>商輪載重綫法</h3>
<p>限制運貨逾量以防肇禍</p>
<p>頒布法則聘請專家辦理</p>
<p>我國商輪載重、向無限制之法規、遂有船東貪圖營業、裝載逾量之貨、而致發生禍患者、已數見不鮮矣、交部航政司、特爲此事、提議與辦載重綫法、已由航政會議决定、由部積極進行、茲將原委查誌如下</p>
<h3>載重法之利益</h3>
<p>各國商輪於裝載貨物、政府均有載重綫法之限制、在船身上列有載重綫、各船裝貨、不得超過此綫、免生危險、我國無此項專家、故各商輪運貨、迄無載重綫之規定、實則此事關係頗大、非精於此科者不堪勝任、如劃綫淺則貨少而船東損虧、劃綫涳則航行發生危險、故現行各航輪裝貨、無法定之標準、</p>
<h3>航政司之提議</h3>
<p>此次航政會議、交部航政司交議案中、卽有載重綫法急須施行之案、此項實施、自杜裝貸逾量之弊、如寗波某輪等之沉失、溺斃數百人慘案、其最近之事例也、若載重綫法實行、則各船之限制儎脚噸量、當予以運貨、聞該標凖草案卽高廷梓等所擬者、</p>
<h3>測量計算程序</h3>
<p>各輪噸位大小、船身艙位之搆造亦不同、篱行此法、須先由專家會同各地航政局派員恊助、至各商輪上、實施測量共艙位之深淺、計算船體輕重儎之吃水、以定載重綫、由專家劃定此綫時、航政局卽加蓋印章以昭愼重、</p>
<h3>聘定外員主辦</h3>
<p>各國航輪、原有國際載重綫公約會議、我國前未加入、惟我國商輪行駛香港大連等埠者亦頗多、我國旣不在國際載重綫公約之内、則所劃之綫、能否爲各該港官廳所認可、尙係一問題、交部討論之下、以西人英羅氏爲載重綫專家、爲各國所深知其人者、我國實行載重綫法、决討聘英羅氏擔任此職、會同航政局實行測繪各商輪之載重綫、一面將載重綫法加以修正、卽行公布施行云、</p>

<p>川帮恊商　旅滬川帮如蘇貨棉紗五金等對於渝商會調停辦法、均表示接受、原定四月一日起實行復運、今因外商輪船公司反對、而同盟公約已决定解散、特於昨日、分别恊商對於復運問題、須視各輪船公司水脚高低而决定、因此又暫行停辦貨物、至於各輪船公司解散同盟後之水脚、均未開出、大都在觀望中、</p>

<h3>張織雲訴周孝伯案</h3>
<p>張旣選任律師起訴又狀請法院澈查</p>
<p>復言在外已和解法官如墮五里霧中</p>
<p>前曾被選爲中國第一屆電影皇后之張織雲、自與其前夫仳離後、卽蹴居滬上、未幾識律師周孝伯、雙方互訂嫁娶、詎最近張忽委單毓華律師、以妨害風化罪訴周孝伯於第一特院、業經開庭兩次、自訴人與被告、均未到案、僅各由代理律師出庭、而斯時張織雲、忽於首次庭訊後、另委唐鳴時律師、具狀法院、聲明本人並未提起訴訟、請求法院澈查聞、而自訴代理人、則又稱確曾於本月二十三日下午一時、接爱張織雲親自委任、對周具狀起訴、核諸兩狀上張之籨名式樣筆跡、則又相符、故此案内幕究竟如何、頗堪玩味、茲將調查及庭訊所得、紀述如下、</p>
<h3>律師與影星締約</h3>
<p>張織雲、年二十九歲、自當年主演「失戀」影片後、卽擺脫電影生活、息影滬濱、去年張以債務關係、被債權人探諸法院、當時張曾延周孝伯律師爲之代理、兩人因此相識往還旣密、彼此竟成知已、不久卽進而謀聯秦晋之好、並於去年五月三日、由顧表夫律師證明雙方釘立婚約（錄後）、實行同居、再行繹日結婚、旋張以發覺周孝伯早娶南通張退庵之孫女張秀武爲妻、乃根據婚約與之交涉無效、始其狀第一特院、以刑法第二百四十四條之妨害風化罪、提起控訴、並附帶民訴、請求判令周孝伯給予撫慰金十五萬元肽損失費五萬元、共計二十萬元、</p>
<h3>第一次庭訊改期</h3>
<p>經由第一特院准狀、於本月二十三日下午二時、由劉毓桂推事升座第八刑庭審理、當時張織雲與周孝伯均未到庭、僅由自訴人代理律師單毓華到庭聲稱、當事人張織雲、本應到案、盲由本案被告周孝伯現方挽人調停、故未投案、請求庭長改期十日、以便和解、劉推事審核之下、遂諭曰本案兩造如能在外和解最好、否則關於兩造訂約地點及被告確實住址、須於下次庭訊時、先行報告本院、本案准予改期至三月三十日下午再訊而退、</p>
<h3>兩狀簽字均相同</h3>
<p>詎翌立（廿四日）法院方面、忽接張織雲另委唐嗚時律師具狀稱、張本人並未有向周孝伯提起訴訟情事、並聲請法院澈查、則此次忽然起訴、從何而來、法院察核之下、深覺此中必有曲折、昨日下午二時、又屆續審之期、劉毓桂推事升座公案後、卽宣稱三月二十四日張織雲所呈之狀、以彼不知起訴周孝伯之事、請求法院查究、但察核狀尾張之簽字、與自訴周考伯狀尾所簽之字又筆跡相同、何以前後矛盾、究竟内幕如何、本院定當澈查、單毓華律師聞諭遂稱似此情形、泃屬兒戲、欲求明瞭眞相、應着自訴人及被告到案、但張間已另案被捕、雖卽保釋、迄未見面、故惟有請求將其拘案俾明一切</p>
<h3>法官認爲極離奇</h3>
<p>而本律師接受其委任、不特係其親自委任、且上次（二十三日）庭訊小時前、彼尙來求面代表其出庭、並云彼本人以種種關係、不能投案、當時卽告以須親自到庭、而彼又云周孝伯亦不到、故彼不能到庭、至訴狀内之字、乃張在南京路大陸商塲四樓馬君碩律師事務所仙親簽、當時張之妹亦在塲云云、繼被告代理律理王傅璧亦起稱、自訴人與被告確已於本年二月十三日彼此和解成立解除婚約、當時曾由李時苑·唐鳴時律師·等證明、遂將該約呈案、經劉推事審視之下、則所簽之字、確又張之親筆、乃諭曰、本案事屬奇謬、容本院澈查、改期再訊、並諭知單律師、向張訊問何以前後矛盾、萬一自訴人已在外接受調解、則儘可向本院撤回自訴、又諭知王律師云、如婚約確已解除、而被告認此次被訴有妨害名譽情事、亦儘可另行起訴、</p>
<h3>恊訂婚約之内容</h3>

<h3>怎樣研究憲法</h3>
<p>這是續稿，昨天討論的是（一）國人對於政治的態度（二）憲法之意義（三）研究之方法。今天續論研究方法。　　編者</p>
<p>有些人以爲··雖則議會政治常爲少數人操縱，但全民政治卽德謨克拉西這種理想究竟未可厚非；我們要除去少數人操縱政權、却不宜反對民主政治，因此他們認爲民主政治不能實現的原因，祇是選舉的不得法或者是議會制度一種麻醉大衆的更猛烈的毒汁、它完全掩飾了現實，不問民主政治應當在何種條件之下纔能實現、不問民主政治所以不能在現社會實現的原因。眞正民主政治的實現，必須具有「全社會是和諧的」，「人人的利益是一致的」，這些前提。但現社會是否是「和諧的呢？是否「人人的利益一致的呢」？自然，不是的。就現在幾個有名的民治國家來說，如英美法等國，我們祇見在他們的社會中是形成了兩個大壁壘，相互以鬥爭的姿態出現於政治無臺上。尤其在帝國主義階段的今日，因着資本主義體系的分解，新的生産關係的孕育與壯大，在政治上愈激成這兩個壁壘的對立，形成一個在防護鞏固這一政權，一個在破壞與爭取這一政權，政治形態上表出的便是暴權政治的囂張；另一方面則爲革命騷擾，新政權的建立。在這個動盪的政局的璨在，虛僞的民主政治是走向末路了，於是英國倫敦大學政治系主任丨著名的士大夫階級學者拉斯基）Ｌaski（敎授，也不得不難着這樣說。丨「虛僞的民主政治是走向末路了···」但是民主政治的本身並不是空想，祇要人與人之間没有現在這樣的利害的對立，眞正人民的「公意」就會現出了，眞正的民主政治自然也不是不可實現的事。</p>
<p>第二研究憲法應當作整個兒的觀察，從事物的聯係中去研究，我們不應當單看到某一章的規定，須同時去看到實現此種制度的前提的其他規定，究竟如何。譬如「自由」「平等」等等口號吧，在現在恐也祇是憲法上的一些少不了的條文，實際上並無其事。「集會自由」照法律上是人人都有的，但社會上低等階級，他們自己那裏有開會塲所，會更何從開起！言論自由要不妨害統治者的地位之範圍内纔可以。有錢被選去管理國家政治。是以所請「平等」與「自由」等都有其他先决定條件在，不是單靠條文就可保障的，就可獲得的。）未完（</p>

<h3>馬來酋長想討日本老婆</h3>
<p>— 張直如女士</p>
<p>南洋大巽他羣島之中，在婆羅洲東岬角的地方，有一個Ｋ字形的大島，就是西里伯士。這個好地方，有綠油油的高山，有碧澄澄的湖沼，南國春光，和煦宜人。雖在一六六○年時，歸荷蘭管領，爲荷屬東印度之一部；但仍保持其土王寳座，其所以不變其俗之故，這是荷人推行殖民政策的一種手腕，落得給他一點虛榮顔色，自己便可以安享其成。</p>
<p>日本北海道大學醫學敎授，木丁良順博士，去年在南洋一帶遊歷，順便研究熱帶風土病症，前月回國，曾發表談話說；西里伯士的早婚風氣，非常盛行，依據統計所示，平均十一歲已做了小母親了；又因不衛生故，幼兒之死亡率，在出世第一年中爲百分之四十七；而白痴畸形兒更多。當道出望加錫埠時，該地酋長曾請他診過病，因此知酋長已往家世和現在情形甚詳，說酋長素慕日本婦女的婉好，對丈夫最能温存體貼，故不久將到日本來游，步亞齊阿比亞王子的後塵，也想娶一日女爲殯妃云。言下大有煤翁自任，玉成其美的意思。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十六回慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國　凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懷人</p>
<p>桂枝帶了微笑，和曼英閑談了幾句，看看那位秦君竟是没有要走的樣子，自己坐在這裏，竟是從中打斷人家的情致，便站起來笑道··我要告辭了，你有功夫到海甸去玩玩呀。曼英連忙站起來，將房門攔住着道··怎麽着，這樣遠的道你跑了來，茶也没有喝一口，欠就要走嗎？桂枝道··我早就到北京來了，在親戚家裏住着，我現在要回海甸去了，所以順便到府上來看看。我約定了今天回家去的，我到遲了，母親要盼望的。他口裏說着，手就握住了曼英的手，笑道··改天見罷，我們不客氣。他口裏說着，竟是側了身子擠將出來。他這個樣子要走，曼英不能硬拖住他，只好隨在身後，送到大門口來。桂枝走回家去，一路想着，自己本來有許多話要和曼英商量的。但是看看曼英這種樣子腦筋裏已經没有了田連長，自己再把思慕丈夫的話，去和曼英說，那豈不是找釘子碰。而且那位秦君坐在屋子裏，並不因爲女客到了，起身要走，彼此互相對峙着，也不是辦法。可是黄太太對他姑娘這樣，也同意嗎？他納着悶回得家來，江氏却大吃一驚，連連的問道··你怎麽了？在城裏頭，没有躭擱嗎？桂枝早就把答詞預備好了，便道··黄小姐不在家，他們老太太，又不大舒服，我在那廟碍人家的事作什麽？他說着一直走回自己的新房裏去。這天晚上，是個深秋的雨夜，桂枝吃了晚飯，就假裝睡覺，把房門閉上。（三五○）</p>
<h3>硯的研究（十）（四）</h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>▲端硯概况▲</p>
<p>（四）詠硯的詞　從文藝方面言：自唐宋以迄清季，關於詠硯的詩詞歌賦，見於前人文集及各種紀種者，不啻汗牛充楝，但或則空言讚美，或則歌誦其人，或則紀述其事，而對於硯材的美惡研究確有心得者，則絕少槪見。余近於書肆中，購獲吳邦治先生所書「周祖鎭端州硯坑新志」及「端溪硯新譜」墨蹟一册，附詞十首，據朱受祉先生所述，謂此詞乃友人於粤東傳來，何人所作，粤人皆不能知。惟其詞對於端硯的材質，頗有認識，錄之以供研究端硯者參考之資料。</p>
<h3>端硯十詞</h3>
<p>端溪硯，遠自嶺南來。穴洞取材經險阻。鑿山通道費紆迴。不易到書齋。</p>
<p>端溪硯，辨　莫朦朧。巖内更須分上下。洞中還要别西東。優劣逈難同。</p>
<p>端溪硯，品類亦多般。淡紫羊肝　鵅眼。暈紅馬尾　鴣斑。蕉白淺深間。</p>
<p>端溪硯，此擬與君如。膩潤十分同軟玉。酥融一片若凝脂。上品定如斯。</p>
<p>端溪硯，佳處貴青花。瀲灔晴波浮荇藻。微茫碧落映雲霞。活潑更鮮華。</p>
<p>端溪硯，試叩若無聲。渾樸自然成木訥。柔嘉豈合作金鳴。最忌響琤琤。</p>
<p>端溪硯，利用得精良。運墨快逢膠漆友。濡毫疑入水雲鄕。樂事在文房。</p>
<p>端溪硯，美質恨多疵。火燄夾砂堅似鐵。黄龍包蛀爛如泥，暗　亦非宜。</p>
<p>端溪硯，眞賞　人傳。認眼易訛三水石。求全多買半邊嵐。差勝亦朝天。</p>
<p>端溪硯，仿古莫　裁。鏤葉鐫花嗤俗樣。雕龍刻鳳敗良材。廣做石之災。</p>

<h3>春天的蘇州</h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>在這天堂般的蘇州，春已悄悄來臨。梅花雖已謝了，但柳已茁綠葉，杏也發着紅萼，大地上面，早蒙上了一層濛濛的新綠，這確是一年中最適宜於遊覽的時期！大有人在。現在我把蘇州的名勝古跡約略記述一二，以供一般遊客遊玩時的參考。</p>
<p>▲山之部</p>
<p>蘇州的山，雖缺少雄偉氣槪，但秀麗幽美，自有一種温柔的美態。歸有光的吳山圖記，使人讀了，兀覺依依難捨，發生美感。加着近來名勝所在，人工的建設逐漸添建，好似十七妙年華的女郎，簪花抹粉，妝扮得益發使人受不忍捨。</p>
<h3>虎邱山</h3>
<p>離蘇州最近的，當然要推吳王埋骨的虎邱山了。虎邱雖係培塿小山，但近年因着新的建築，逐漸增添，舊的勝跡加以飾新，收拾得奶曲折可觀。山頂上所建的那座高閣，共有兩座名匾，于右任的「虎伏閣」，和吳蔭培的「挹爽閣」，一同懸在閣裏，登閣遠跳，城郭山林，盡收眼底，山麓大街上的長興館飯店，所有魚鼈蝦蟹，都養在河裏，等客斬鮮，味極鮮美。靈巖山</p>
<p>因着苧蘿村女，在山巔榮幸了若干時日，雖然館娃官址。已改爲梵皇官殿，但靈巖名勝，終仗着西子遺跡，艶稱人間。絕代尤物，確也可以名傳千古。靈巖山在域西木凟鎭上，有輪船可通該處，將來蘇木汽車路築成之後，交通更可便利。山上的古跡，像琴臺，西施洞，響屧廊，梳妝臺等等，都是西子的遺跡，近來山頂的靈巖寺，大興土木，建築得富麗堂皇，在寺内鐘樓上遠眺太湖，采香一涇，箭也般直貫湖中，風景是十分可觀的。</p>
<p>天平山</p>
<p>去年景范路築成之後，天平的交通，便捷不少。由木凟乘轎或人力車，大約五里路程，就可直達山麓。山麓的高義莊，是宋代大儒范仲淹的祖墓所在，萬枝石笏，林林朝天，别具雄偉氣槪。山上有缽盂精舍，那裏的泉水，清冽醇厚，稱爲天下第三泉。上面更有上白雲，中白雲，一綫天各種勝跡。那幾塊奇石，像卓筆峯，飛來峯，五丈石等，更歌詠有詩。名著吳門。</p>
<p>此外光福鎭上的命尉，玄墓諸山。是以梅名震全國，善人橋的穹窿山。山頂殿宇連雲，香汎當兒，盛極一時；白馬澗的天池册，幽倩曲折，别有風韻，不過交通方面，都没有虎邱等山便捷，往返須多費時日。至於七子山，上方山，交通雖然近些，但風景却無甚可觀，除了香汎時，是難吸引遊客前往的。</p>
<p>▲水之部</p>
<p>蘇州的水，雖有石湖等處，但因没有旁的襯托，浩浩森森，茫無邊際，在這春季裏，是不適於一舸輕舲，容與中流的。蘇州的水，石湖以月著名，合宜於秋季游玩，荷花蕩的荷花，是宜於消夏的。至於那三萬六千頃的太湖，雖明債幽秀，入佛西子湖中，但因點綴無物，風波太惡，總覺不宜遊玩。</p>
<p>▲園林之部</p>
<p>蘇州的園林，雖已頺廢過半，但未經兵燹，範圍就也無大變更。下面幾處，是現在開放而又便於遊覽的園林。</p>
<p>留園</p>
<p>在閶門外留園馬路，是盛氏遺産，固逆産問題，曾一度入公，不久方才發還。園廟的陳設，經此變故，精彩遂也減色不少。園中有楠木廳，雕鏤精美，爲蘇州園林中特有的建築物。此外廳，堂，山，樹，等等，尙保存富麗堂皇的大家風範。</p>
<p>西園</p>
<p>在留園西面，係戒幢寺的放生池。那一池清水，巨大清澈，粼粼可愛。池中建着六角亭，兩邊建着曲折的石橋，池中的鯉與黿，巨大活潑，很是有名，池畔水榭，因改建佛殿，近已拆去了。</p>
<p>此外城中皇廢基的公園，最適宜於夏季乘凉名的，近來闆門外小河沿的張園，也容人遊覽，爲園林中的後起之秀。</p>

<p>近有青年生活社·汪流文學會·現代思潮社·上海文化恊會·獅吼文藝社·大學新聞社·星期文藝社·文藝春秋會·日出文藝社等國内三百餘著名文化團體、因鑒於現階段中國文化界、缺少堅固之聯絡、特發起組織中國文化團體聯合會、以聯合全國文化團體共同完成中國新文化運動爲任務、最近該會積極進行、聞全國本外埠以及南洋等地文化團體、已紛參加、不久卽可成立、當爲中國文化界之新現象云、</p>
<h3>發起緣起</h3>
<p>該會發起起緣起下、文化的使命是反映時代、同時也是推動時代、但是中國的文化運動、十餘年來因由於整個社會狀態的動亂、以致反映到文化發展上的鈍滯、這已形成不可否認的事實、因此、現階段的中國文化界、仍滯留在一種混亂的狀態中、以及一切封建和反時代的文化依然可以苟延其生命、這是無疑需要中國新文化運動加速進展、方可消滅阻碍時代的封建文學的生存、而奠定中國新文化的基礎、爲了要加速地推進我們的新文化運動、爲了要聯合中國文化界共同負起完成推進文化的使命、當然迫切需要集團的力量來促成這偉大的任務、所以中國文化團體聯合會就適應這客觀俱體的需要而産生了我們相信中國許多散漫的文化集團、固然有着不同的環境、形成不同的傾向、但是我們需要完成中國新文化運動、而要負起時代的使命、向着光明的大道邁進、這是完全一致的啊、所以我們理解了我們的使命、深感中國的文化團體者有携手合作起來的必要、我們歡迎全國的文化團體共同參加、并且我們也希望全世界各國的文化團體聯合會熱烈地響應我們以便完成這偉大的使命</p>
<h3>籌備近訊</h3>
<p>聞該會發起團曾召集籌備會、共策進行、并且最近有全世界各國之文化團體聯合會聲予合作外、歐迎全國關於文化團體參加及合作、以便推進中國之新文化運動、該會總籌備處暫設在康腦脫路綠楊邨十二號云、</p>

<h3>對憲法草案初稿國民敎育章貢獻三點意見（上）·謝·恩·臯</h3>
<p>憲法爲國家根本大法、敎育爲國家精神建設的重要工具、現代世界各國新制定的憲法、幾靡不有敎育專章或專條的列入、其重視敎育的地位、在今日已成一致的趨勢、觀於歐洲芬蘭立陶宛等國憲法、則有敎育專章之設、捷克斯拉夫南斯拉夫葡萄牙西班牙波蘭羅馬尼亞希臘及亞洲土耳其非洲埃及等國憲法、則有敎育專條之設、可以瞭然、我國在憲法上列有敎育專條的、起於民國十二年十月十日公布的中華民國憲法、列有敎育專章的、起於民國二十年六月一日公布的中華民國訓政時期約法、在前民國元年制定的中華民國臨時約法、民國五年制定的中華民國約法、對於敎育均尙無隻字提及、於此知敎育在我國法律上地位的增進昨日今朝亦大不同、</p>
<p>最近立法院制定中華民國憲法草案初稿公開徵求意見、其中華國民敎育章丨丨第四章丨丨計列有十三條文、所有關於國家敎育政策、敎育宗旨、敎育事業監督、敎育權利保障、義務敎育、敎育經費、學術文化的獎勵與保護等原則、雖大體仍本訓政時期約法、然與各國憲法比較、已不能不謂爲詳備、顧中國爲一落後國家、敎育無論從質與量任何一方面考察、均去吾人的理想尙遠、民智低下、到處有事實可見、以致國家一切建設事業、皆鮮長足之進步、欲使中國成爲現代化的國爱、根本之圖、惟有先以全力推進敎育、提高民智、然後國家始有改造希望、故就中國國情需要觀察、憲法敎育章須予補充者至少尙有左列主個原則、</p>
<p>一·義務敎育經費須規定中央與地方共同負担我國義務敎育從前清宣統三年、進行至今日、各地失學兒童總數、仍有警人之紀錄、考其原因、固由於敎育行政方面推進不力、而地方敎育經費籌措維艱、確亦屬顯著的事實、依敎育部實施義務敎育初步計畫估計、全國未入學的學齡兒童約有三千七百十九萬人、若每人每年假定需敎育費七元、則每年需增籌敎育經費二萬六千餘萬元、而後義務敎育才有普及之望、此二萬六千餘萬先、如完全限令全國一千九百四十三縣自籌、平均計算、每縣每年至少須加重負担義敎經費十三萬餘元、其他師資的訓練與样舍設備的添置尙不在内、但目前各縣地方敎育經費大都已異常支絀、他姑不論、卽以號稱富足的江蘇而言、全省六十一縣、各縣現有敎育經費總數、據江蘇敎育廳統計報告、中數不過爲六萬餘元、其能超出十三萬餘元以上者、不及半數、至於其他貧瘠省分、每縣原有敎育經費數多則不過一二萬元、少且不及千元、以之全部移充義敎之用、尙虞不給、何况地方敎育事業多端、義敎以外、還有所謂高級小學、幼稚敎育、社會敎育中等敎育、敎育行政等、在在均須動支經費、而且我國各地現有經費來源、大宗出諸雜捐特稅、繁重苛細、難必他日不設法蠲除、一時再欲爲義敎經費增籌巨量數額、恐爲事實所不許、以此責望地方、豈非是「俟河之清」、查世界各國成例、義敎經費大都由中央與地方政府共同負責、如英國中央負担二分之一、地方負担二分之一、瑞典中央負担十分之九、地方負担十分之一、瑞士中央負担十分之一、省負担十分之三、地方負担十分之六、法比荷小學敎師薪傣均由中央負担、其他費用則由地方供給、凡麥鄕村小學亦同、都市小學中央負担四分之一、地方負担、四分之三、德國在新憲法未公布前、小學敎師薪俸中央補助一部分、地方負担一部分、新憲法公布後、亦完全改由中央負担、意大利西班牙之公正小學、中央亦負担經費之一部分、其餘則歸諸地方、美國義敎經費向由省與地方分担、歐戰以還、敎育人士亦盛倡以國庫歲收十分之一補助地方敎育之議、日本由國庫基金補助小學敎師年功加俸、今亦有人倡議增加、可知義務敎育乃國家敎育一種政策、國家决不能置身事外、不負經費責任、參考國外先例、斟酌國内情形、我以爲我國不欲普及義務敎育則己、如其不然、義敎經費負擔分配、最低限度中央須任百分之三十、省須任百分之二十、各縣只能任百分之五十、在直轄行政院之市、省及縣的負擔、統由市庫支給、對於貧瘠省縣、中央負擔比率並應酌量提高、務使推行盡利、早達普及的目的、至於中央負擔的百分之三十、全年計需支出七千八百餘萬元、驟視之似覺過鉅、其實此數與中央所任軍費此較、尙不及三分之一、中央敎育經費果能提高佔預算總額百分之十五丨見草案第四十條丨則此所需之數、當不患無出處、否則以鹽稅移充、亦不得不謂爲合理、因爲鹽稅是一種普稅、稅率之同、爲各國所罕見、稅收年達一萬萬以上、不論貧富階級、此種義務莫不負擔、民國二年雖會以之抵押五國善後借欵、但現已逐漸清償、轉瞬可以移用、倘使仍有不足、遺産稅所得稅在别國均爲敎育經費最好資源、我國亦不妨仿行、</p>

<h3>最精密的電壓表</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>普通的電壓表，牠本身的電阻，大槪祇有幾百或是幾千歐姆。此種低電阻的電表，指針跳動滿盤時，需用電流很多。因此，牠祇能在電阻極低的綫路内使用。（如測量乾電池或蓄電池的電壓等）如果拿來測量高電阻綫路内的電壓，（如Ｂ代電器的電壓等）那麽，因爲内外阻的緣故，大部份的電壓，便都降落在高電阻綫路内，電壓表上所指未的數値，祇是實在電壓的一小部份而已。</p>
<p>測量高電阻綫路内的電壓，常用的是一種高電阴電壓表。（High　ResistanceVoltmeter）此種電壓表本身電阻雖然極大，（每伏脫大約有一千歐姆的電阻）作用雖然非常靈敏··（祗要Ｉma的電流，便能使指針跳動滿盤。）但是無論如何，也要消耗外界一部份的電流，所以牠測到的數値，依舊不是原來的電壓。這在交流收音機開放時，任你接上怎樣高電阻的電壓表，音量總見减低，是可以證明的。</p>
<p>這樣看來，可知電壓表測到的數値，其凖確程度若何，是以牠本身電阻的多少爲轉移的。換句話說··電壓表消耗外界電流愈小，則測到的數値便愈凖確。</p>
<p>本篇所介紹的電壓表，是根據力學上「動力（Ａction）如等於反動力，（Ｒeaction）則物體恒在靜止狀態。」的定律而設計的。牠在使用的時候，絕不消耗外界電流，因此，牠測到的數値，纔是電路内實在的電壓。（ＲealＶoltage）</p>
<p>圖中所示者，爲一能供給五百五十伏次之常用Ｂ代電器，ＲＩ爲五萬歐姆之直綫形電位表，（LinearPotentiometer）</p>
<p>Ｖ爲相當數値之電壓表，ＭＡ爲Ｏ之千分安培表。使用時，先將電位表旋至零度。（卽圖中所示a點）待測電壓Ｅ，接在（十）（一）接綫柱後，電壓表Ｖ卽有紀錄。次將電位表緩緩向Ｂ處旋動，同時再調節Ｒ２，至電壓表指針降至零點，千分安培表恰爲roMa，時爲止。此時依據上述定律，得待測電壓Ｅ之數値爲Ｏ·ＯrXr伏次。</p>
<p>因爲Ｒr是直綫形的電位表，牠的數値，是依一定的比例而增加的，所以Ｒ之數値忱便可自電位表度盤上所指示的度數直接推算而得。譬如電位表從零點至最大點，牠的旋轉度盤，一共劃分一百度，那麽每一度的數値，便等於５０００丨１００＝５００歐姆，卽Ｒr内通過roma時，每一度便等於o·orX500=5伏次。如圖假定自Ａ至Ｃ爲五十度，得</p>
<p>E＝o　or×r</p>
<p>＝o.or×（５０×５００）</p>
<p>＝o.or×25000</p>
<p>＝２５０Ｖ.</p>
<p>或＝５０×５＝２５０Ｖ·（每度等於五伏次）</p>
<p>爲求測騐更進一步凖確計，可在電位表指度盤上加裝一個微分指度盤，（請參閱本刋第十二期拙著「最精密的指度盤」）便可測到半個伏脫（o·５Ｖ·）的數値。</p>
<h3>自差法超短波收音機</h3>
<p>— 鑑村</p>
<p>在收聽六十mc（五公尺）波長之超短波收意機，自來均採用無極回授之法，但用無極回授法時，則難免有雜音之騷擾，且具有缺乏選擇性之劣點，接收超短波者每爲所苦。茲爲補救上述之缺點計，特介紹一較安定之自差法（Autodyne丨method），於接收五十六mc至六十mc之週波帶，獲得極良好的效果。其綫路如第一圖所示。</p>
<p>圖中並無回授圈（Tickler-Coil），一見似非採用回授法者然，但在陰極綫第一圖</p>
<p>路中插入一高週率阻流圈Ｒ·Ｆ·Ｃ·，與屏栅兩綫路成一共通迴阻，而引起回授作用。此種陰極阻流圈可不必採用嚴密凖確之値，如用二·五m.h左右之値，則可適合於五六mc及二八mc週波帶之接收。若將此種阻流圈除去，而代之以數百歐姆左右之無誘導耗阻，亦能適用，但此時在檢波管則因成音週率乹流而生Self-bias，殊非可取。回授度卽由電位器Ｒ變換簾栅電壓而調整之。眞空管如採用傍熱式三極管（例如五六號式管）亦可同樣引起回授作用，但如採用簾栅極管則靈敏度之調整較易也。</p>
<p>第二圖</p>
<p>全機之連接如第二圖所示，係高週率放大一級，回授檢波，成音週率放大一級之綫路。如點綫所示，天綫用綫圈或電容器兩樣交連而成，但在超短波，無論遮蔽如何適當，高週率綫路中亦易發生自己振盪，故欲其不發生自己振盪，必須選擇適當之栅負荷爲要。</p>
<p>茲將第二圖所須之主要機件列舉於下··</p>
<p>Ｌ·········十六號漆包綫，３／８英寸之圓筒，八轉，</p>
<p>Ｌ２·········同上，十轉</p>
<p>ＣＣ５············小號電容器，四片，</p>
<p>Ｃ１Ｃ３Ｃ４···一○○uuf·</p>
<p>Ｃ１２··········一至二２uuf</p>
<p>Ｒ·ＦＣ·······二·五mh</p>
<p>Ｒ···········一○萬至二二萬歐姆</p>
<p>Ｒ１············二至一○兆歐姆</p>
<p>Ｒ６··············五○○歐姆</p>
<h3>礦石單管收音機·明襄·</h3>
<p>礦石雖有檢波的特性，却無放大的可能，所以僅用礦石檢波的收音機輸出的音量極微弱，接收的距離極短近，如在礦石檢波之後，再加一級眞空管的强力放大，則音量可大爲增加，本篇介紹的收音機，簡單效宏，最合初製收音機的同志試騐。</p>
<p>綫路如圖所示，綫圈·Ｌ２與電容器Ｃ１合組成調整綫路，饋至礦石檢波器，再以３３號强力五極管作成音週率放大，此綫路與普通特異者，爲天綫之交連法，Ｌ１Ｌ２Ｌ３係普通三回路綫圈，將屏路回授圈Ｌ１與天綫綫圈Ｌ３相串聯，作爲天綫交連綫圈，轉動回授圈，卽變更天綫交連的疏密度，交連密則靈敏度强然選擇性差，反之亦然。</p>
<p>放大管的栅極負電壓，得自Ｒ１上的電壓降，電容器Ｃ３係電液式的，因其内部的構造，含有微値的感應度，所以此電容器除使成音週率電流暢行外，兼有高週率阻流圈的作用。其正負兩極，不可接錯，否則或將燒穿。</p>
<p>電源供給，Ａ電僅需兩弗打的蓄電瓶，Ｂ電最好用１３５Ｖ·的乾電池，電源插頭係廢棄的四脚眞空管的膠底，照圖連接，用時僅需將膠底插入燈座，ＡＢ電源，已均接妥、如此百但節省手續，並不致因接綫錯誤而燒毁眞空管。</p>

<h3>整流電路（續）</h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>整流的方法有多種，普通的有化學整流機械整流及眞空管整流等三種，前兩者普通用牠來作充電器或業餘試騐，很少用在一般的交流收音收音機内，所以這裏略而不談，現在就把眞空管整流，略述如下　　如圖一是用兩極眞空帶的半波整流綫路（如８１號）Ｔ是電源變壓器，牠的作用是把一百十或二二百二十的交流，變成所需要的高壓及低壓來供整流管的屏極及絲極，圖中Ｓ，是高壓次級圈，Ｓ２是低壓次級圈以供燃點燈絲之用，當初級圈Ｐ接至交流電源時，次級卽有同週波誘導電流發生、故當整流管之絲極熾熱時，祇能使屏極有正電子的半週波電流通過，而其帶負電子的半週波電流卽被拒絕，因成整流作用，此種整流，僅取交流之半波，其他半波則捨而不用，故謂半波整流，其所整流後之電流，顫動很大，濾波不易，故須有適當之濾波器以穩定之。</p>
<p>圖二</p>
<p>如圖二是用雙屏眞空管的全波整流綫略（如８０）Ｉ是電源變壓器，與前同，不過次級高壓圈Ｓ，的圈數要加倍，在中間抽，的圈數要加倍，在中間抽一中心分綫，當初級Ｐ通至電源時，次級卽得同週波之誘導電流，因之Ｓ，兩端，在同一半週期内，其正負適相反，亦卽兩屏在同一半週期内，其正負相反，設在某半週期内，其中一屏荷正，故有電流通過，而其他一屏，則因荷負，而無電流通過，（其理同半波整流）及至第二半週期時，兩屏正負適各互換，以前荷正之一屏，此時荷負而無電流通過，而以前荷負之一屏，此時荷正而有電流通故因此兩屏交替工作，而成全波整流，其整流後之電流，顫動不大，因此種整流，其電壓之每半週均受利用，故其週率之變動，較大一倍，因之濾流之裝置可較簡省。</p>
<h3>小經騐</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>簾栅眞空管收音機調整之一法用簾栅式眞空管之新式收音機，若將音量調節開至最小之地位時，每致音調不佳。此種收音機在收聽近地强力電台時，必須將音量大爲减小；否則因聲浪過强，反不悅耳。但音量减小後，又必致音調粗劣，有顧此失彼之弊。欲其音調和諧，而同時音量又不過强者，但須將該收音機之第一級眞空管上之帽取去，同時减小天線回路及高週率級之配合度。如是則音量調節可開至適中之點，以得適度之音量及和谐之音調。此種調整法簡便易行，對於收音機亦並無損害。若欲收聽遠地或小電台時，則可照原式裝復而後收之。（註··該眞空管上之帽取下之後，應用紙包裹，以免與機中他處相觸，而遭意外損失。</p>

<h3>危機</h3>
<p>— 兀</p>
<p>打動一個人的心理的方法很多，最通常是動之以利害。中國古時游說之士抵掌而談之際，大槪最初要敷說大禍害，使聽者感覺没有方法了，然後方信受他的道理。</p>
<p>「善堂」和「同善社」這一沫人物發出來的言論，大抵是現世已到了「末劫」，要「刀兵水火一齊來」，愚夫愚婦方聽了以動心，去拜服其「先師」，或「老師」之類。西洋吃宗敎飯的也大抵如此，總之訶責凡夫有罪，懺悔宜先。或則獻身，或則納金，以爲贖。否則有地獄的魔鬼，要叉去其靈魂。内地許多「風水先生」，「陰陽家」，在人家的墳上或屋中長嘆一聲或大笑一聲，繼之以鬼話連篇，必使主人動色。</p>
<p>凡提倡政治上的鬥膄者亦復如此，大勢「尖銳化」了，局面「緊張化」了。只剩下兩條路了，或生，則從我；或死，則不從我。······諸如此類。大抵是要弄去人的肉體和靈魂。甚而至於往往是剩下這麽一個問題，「你已經停止打你的妻子了麽？」丨丨yes和No都要使人窘於回答的。</p>
<p>遙想耶穌抛開了一枚金錢，說··「讓愷撒的歸愷撒吧！」是多麽超脫的回答，但也滑頭得可觀。其實也因爲早看穿了這一套反戲。社會上陷害人家是留心觀察着他的道路後，安排一種機括，使他走向右也錯了，向左也錯了，兩面皆於其不利，成爲一個好的Dilemmao没有耶穌的勇邁，是要被坑害的。</p>
<p>固然，故意製造出來的局很多，若眞有「事實」的「危機」，「尖銳」化了「緊張」化了又怎樣呢？答覆這問題也容易，仍然是一古事，不但雙方，簡直是多方於已不利的丨丨某和尙問「求道」··「進前三步如何」？答覆是··「撞頭碰額！」；「退後三步如何？」丨丨「一落千丈」。「不進不退如何？」丨丨「立地死滅」！</p>

<h3>滇曲掇拾</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>在雲南西部的五六月間，大約可以說是最有浪漫氣氛的季節吧。倘若走在田野阡陌間，那些從身苗上面飄來的歌聲，凖會不時聽見着的。而且陌生男女互相唱和的曲子，總是比較來得多些。比如一聽見女的在唱··「白布帳子花枕頭，問你小哥睡哪頭？」就有男的接下去··「小哥路程來得遠，就與小妹睡一頭。」據說，一對青年男女，因爲一時唱得高興，以至相愛起來，便挽着手，走到山後林中去的事情，也是往往有的。</p>
<p>不過在這裏，我倒不要抄出這些情歌，却高興把彼此戲謔的調子寫點來看看··「吃菜要吃白菜心，養女要稼唐督軍，走在人前多好看，喊聲太太又好聽。」女的向男子唱這個</p>
<h3>新農謠</h3>
<p>— 絃孑</p>
<p>山裏山，灣裏灣，現在做人實在難。</p>
<p>舊年年成雖然好，穀價跌得難温飽。我家老小共七口，過年祇剩麥五斗。前村李公公，債主逼得病勢兇。隔壁二舅舅，押出女兒做丫頭。全村多少男和女，都向上海謀生路。山裏有地無人種，畈裏有田没人耕，村前村後閙鬼神。，與其說是表現她的虛榮心，倒不如說是故意使村漢一類的對手，感到些微難堪吧。男的呢，便馬上諷刺過來··「吃菜要喫苦菜心，養女莫嫁唐督軍，走在人前倒好看，喊聲奴婢怪難聽。」</p>
<p>至於男的唱··「三位大嫂過河溪，中間那位是我妻，頭上金簪是哥打，肚中娃娃是哥哩。」（哩，的也。）倘把這變成說白，那會不止大挨臭駡的，然而却因其是在唱歌，藉藝術表現出來，所以女的聽着了，不但不生氣，反而會很聰明地回答過去··「三位大嫂過河來，中間那位是你奶，頭上金簪是爺打，肚中娃娃你投胎。」</p>
<h3>論翻譯（續）</h3>
<p>— 唵</p>
<p>二，精究原文。懂原文而翻譯，比「重譯」好。有時要懂的太利害，自覺不能翻而擱筆了，然後方始云能翻。此時勉强之翻，最爲佳翻，甚而得之於牝特驪黄之外，則成爲空前絕後之發現，更爲善譯。直至語言道斷，心思路絕，便存其「不翻」，只好「音譯」。玄奘法師便有五種「不翻」，頗多遠見，條列如左··</p>
<p>一，秘密故丨丨如「陀羅尼」。</p>
<p>二，含多義故丨丨如「薄伽梵」具六義。</p>
<p>三，此無故丨丨如「閻浮樹」，中夏實無此木。</p>
<p>四，順古故丨丨如「阿耨菩提」，非不可翻，而摩騰以來常存梵音。</p>
<p>五，生善故丨丨如「般若」尊重「智慧」輕淺。</p>
<p>地名人中之類，當然以音譯爲佳。今人之譯，也有暗合此類的。「泰晤士」者，因其秘密也；「幽默」者，義多也··「巧克力」，「沙定」者，此無也··「烟士披離純」者，順古也，「奥伏赫變」者，生善故也。此皆不翻，而勝於已翻，比方說··「兄弟剛看倫敦泰唔士。」則聽者肅然起敬，無他，神秘故也。「烟士披···」非不能翻，但「飲冰室主人」旣將其翻爲「烟士披···」，也只是隨他「烟士···」了。「奥伏······」更覺沉重，使人望而生畏，誠恐自己的意識一下被「奥伏···」，不，被「嚇變」了。其生信可知。</p>
<p>但精通原文，不僅是僅到其義而已，要懂到原作之背景。</p>
<p>夫背景也者，官僚最懂到的也。做官要知道誰與誰某有密切關係，誰與誰成爲一系統，翻譯亦然。例如譯哲學名著，頗應知此哲學家的思想的系統，受了誰的影響之類。或如同爲什麽「上峯」賞識了某人，則爲什麽著者要著這麽一本書，也應該弄清楚的。這麽翻譯便可少氣力。又如翻譯西洋小說；則西洋人的生活背景也應知道。俄國之茶具，不類中國之茶壺；敎士之十字劃胸，實不異於和尙之合掌。譬如坐在「窗裏」吃茶或着棋殊可怪，而不知此窗非如中國之一層薄窗，只能坐在「窗下」或「窗前」的。當然，這是比較稀有的例子。</p>
<p>原文之外，能通一二種旁的語言，較勝。也應明一二種古代語，或梵文，或然臘文，或拉丁文；更應多明一二種近代文，或英，德，法，意，各種文字。歐西各民族的文化，皆相互影響的。</p>
<p>旣具備了這兩種條件，便是完全能把握兩種文字了，却來了一個更大的條件，便是··（未完）</p>
<h3>北平素描</h3>
<p>— 姚克</p>
<p>（三）駱駝和其他</p>
<p>多年前我曾看見過一套彩色的北平風景片，其中有一張是一隊黄得可愛的駱駝沿着雄偉的城牆。這個印象在我心裏憧憬了好幾年，因爲我從没有看見過活的駱駝，更没有看見活的駱駝在古的城邊走。</p>
<p>剛到北平時，經過正陽門口的城牆，我張着眼睛向兩邊望，希望有一隊鮮橙子顔色的駱駝跑出來，但不巧得很，望了半天一個駱駝影子也没有。但不久之後，我終於看見了。</p>
<p>那是一個嚴寒的早晨，風刮得很利害，我從東安市塲出來，用手帕掩了口鼻，沿王府井大街向南去。塵土劈臉地吹來，我低着頭把帽沿拉到齊眉，遮蔽着眼睛。忽然我的脚踢着了一個軟綿綿的東西，幾乎絆了一交。</p>
<p>我睜開眼一看，原來是黄茸茸的，像一堆枯草似的東西。啊！不是！這是我夢想中的駱駝匍伏在行人道上！</p>
<p>一共是六隻，　大的軀體幾乎塞滿了整個行人道。小小的頭，小小的眼睛，長而彎曲的頸項，高高隆起的兩峯，都和風景片上的差不多。不過毛的顔色却黄得乾枯，一些光潤的色澤也没有；臀，膝，脅，等處的毛都擦秃了，露出黑黝黝的皮。背峯上繫着又粗又黑的墊子，渾身黑一搭灰一搭的都染着煤和塵土。</p>
<p>從煤棧裏跑出幾個「煤炭鬼」來，把裝滿了煤塊的麻袋馱在駝背的執上，趕駝的　哨一聲，六頭大牲口都馴伏地爬起來。　長的腿，厚軟的蹄，慢慢地踱向前去；毛茸茸的厚眼皮　着牠們細小的眼，不怕風塵但也没有表情。啊！多滯鈍，多没精打采的眼！</p>
<p>這决不是風影片上的駱駝吧？</p>
<p>駱駝之外，北平街道上還有拉貨車的牲口，驢，馬，　，甚至於羊和狗有時也牷在車前幫着驢馬拉車。驢馬在上海也有，跑馬廳的駿馬，駐滬各國軍隊中軍用的高頭大驢，時常在馬路上看得見。不過上海的驢馬是神駿的，毛色都發奕奕的光彩。北平的驢馬非但毛色灰敗，連脊背的弧綫都拉得直僵僵地變了原來的形態。牠們的命運也許還不如駱駝吧。　　○　　○　　○</p>
<h3>民謠</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>剛纔我從街頭過，聽到一羣村兒唱歌，他們用手指着太陽，脚跥著他，齊聲高唱。　　××××××××</p>
<p>提到這支歌眞呌人心驚，曾使得一個暴君投身火坑，今天它來得眞也奇怪，今天是一個什麽世界？</p>
<h3>答何家槐誣害的自白</h3>
<p>— 徐轉蓬</p>
<p>從我的自白刋出後，我便時時刻刻希望着家槐有一個誠實的表示，來了結此事。可是他沉默着，直到廿二日才在本刋上看到他一篇經過</p>
<p>長久時間設計出來的「自白」，但這「自白」仍與事實不合，家槐的態度仍是不誠實的，猶如他「過去的行爲是不誠實一樣」，爲要把事實弄清楚，並請家槐再嚴肅的去「反省」一下，然後再談「新生」，我只是將他誣害或造謠的地方揭破出來··</p>
<p>他那「自白」不但不能說是誠懇的，簡直像小人的羞惱成怒，血口噴人了，他說我有跟他「差不多的行爲」，這種阿Ｑ的卑鄙報復手段，明眼人是會看得清楚的，不過他已指出來誣害我，就不能不一一聲明一下··</p>
<p>（一）在南京中央日報副刋發表的譯作「太陽下的裸婦」，這短篇小說，原文是我在大學裏讀的。因爲覺得很好，隨手翻譯了出來，而那是我第一次的試譯，缺少自信，就請同學周光熙君校閱了一遍，這家槐是很清楚的，可是他現在誣賴原譯者爲周君，而誣我頂替名字！</p>
<p>（二）在杭州民國日報上發表的「大學皇子」，的確是傅尚杲君寫的，那時我爲該刋向傅君拉稿，文章雖拉到，但因爲是一篇遊戲文章，他不願用眞名發表，於是兩人開玩笑般的署上「徐昌」這個名字，我始終也未承認那是我作的，試問在什麽地方我曾用一徐昌」這名字發表文章？</p>
<p>（三）「温梓川君的隨筆二册，他向彭成慧要了去，說寄到中央公園去發表」。這話是什麽意思呢？說寄去，到底寄去没有？寄去的話，還是署温君的名字？還是署我的名字？這點可不用說了，因爲根本没有寄過。</p>
<p>（四）「他也向樓質明陳福熙工君要過小說」。但是要來没有？要來那幾篇？在這裏我又得供出一些事實了··我曾和樓君說過「你也給我一篇」！這笑話是說過的，對陳君却根本没有說這話。友人樓質明（也是家槐的好友）是個在曁南學鐵路管理系的人，不常寫小說，只寫了一篇處女作名「拾荒婦」，已經印好在曁南校刋上，可是家槐一定要拿來算他的。該刋物寄外埠去的已發出，無法可想，在發出本埠的刋物上，則在署樓質明名字的地方，印上何家槐三個紅鉛字，於是照抄了一遍，登在本月號的申報月刋上了。我知道家槐這種情形時，用自己的不愉快去爲質明不愉快了。家槐對於不出名的朋友的作品，老是搶奪，於是我當着家槐和質明面前，一半氣憤，一半挖苦的說··「質明，你也應該送我一篇」！現在就拿這話來藉口誣害我，像這種惡毒報復的手段，我認爲是下流無恥的！</p>
<p>像以上這些毁壞我私人名譽的誣頼，我本可無需聲明，直向法庭起訴，但如今雖一面對讀者聲明，一面仍在凖備提起訴訟。）未完（</p>
<h3>遺書（八）</h3>
<p>— 林徽音</p>
<p>說過，她就告辭了。</p>
<p>去的時候的電車費也是向李媽拿的，現在出了席卓雲的門她已是身邊一個銅元都没有的人了。她不曉得近來這幾天是怎樣過了的，因爲她的經濟的來源早已告了絕路。現在不要說年關過不過去，就是看它在平常的日子，她也無法應付了。</p>
<p>出了席卓雲的門，她從霞飛路的盡頭沿電車路向東遲緩地走着。</p>
<p>「我總想不透席卓雲，」她還似意欲想透他似地在想到他，「他爲什麽要這樣作弄我？他開始答應這樣，答應那樣，而結果連上月份的稿費說也不會發。直到最後他還說要爲我去出售「生之味」，雖然是不一定成功，可是爲什麽不如他所說地打一個電話給我？現在說是不在家，他眞不在家嗎？他以爲我見到了他會釘着他？其實，要是不再有他那最後的約言，難道我今天還會像這樣地去看他？而且，要是他如他所說地打了電話，我也本來無須去看他的。眞不知道他爲什麽要儘這樣地作弄着！也許他並不是有意作弄，只是愚蠢，起初以爲什麽事都辦得到，結果却弄得什麽事都辦不到。他又不敢怎樣堅持，怕會觸犯了他的老板。他祇是個coward！」</p>
<p>想到那裏，她透出了一個深長的太息。</p>
<p>「可是我却做了那愚蠢與懦怯的俘獲物，」她繼續地想。「爲了「生之味」的牽纏，上個月和這個月我什麽别的東西都没有寫，呌我怎能再生存下去？」</p>
<p>她便想到了自殺。自殺是早在她的心中游息過了的，可是這時它似乎挾了更堅强的意志衝入了她的思念。她想還是自殺的好，而現在所在想的是她要用怎樣的方式自殺。她恨透了那殘酷的社會，她要給它一個殘酷的報復，或者也可說給它一個更殘酷的滿足。</p>
<p>至於她的母親，她的弟妹，她也顧不到了。她想他們或者總會能够料理他們自己的，正如現在她在料理她自己一樣。而且她自殺了，她相信「生之味」是一定會馬上被刋印的。一個自殺者的消息剛在社會中開始波動的時候，己有一個刋物在刋印他的遺著，多Sensational！而從「生之味」的被刋印，他們也可得到一筆小小的遺産。或者還有什麽滿身是同情的人還會給他　一些體貼。</p>

<p>昨日江南小洋、早午二市始終未有上落、同爲八百三十三元、做出交易、早市七千角、午市六千角、廣東小洋、早市平平、午市略漲一元、計早市爲七百五十四元五角、午市爲七百五十五元五角、做届交易、早市五萬角、午市二萬角、銅元又長一千五百文、爲三百二十一千五百文、做出交易代價洋一萬零一百元、合銅元額三萬二千四百七十一千五百文</p>
<h3>糧食麵粉南洋銷路略動</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、初平繼定、洋麥報價、芝加哥回好二角左右、坎拿大不動、當初開時、近遠各期、出入無幾、旋以本月份祢一天交易、多頭仍有回出、市勢平平、遠期各月份初亦平軟、後以浮空抵補、略見回高、迨至下午開盤、本月份交易、已見平定、大致在七分左右盤旋、遠期各月份、因此次清明節、交易自二日起至五日止停市有四天之久、廠方抬住四月份、以備抽現之餘地、因此五月份以下、人心頗佳、兼之南洋帮連日均有少數吸進、人心自又活躍矣、結果本月份較小二厘半、四月份好七厘半、五月份好一分七厘半、六月份好一分二厘半、七八月份好七厘半云、</p>
<h3>春寒期麥抛户减少</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面大致呈盤旋之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥好二角零、坎拿大不動、當上下午各盤、近期均無市面、遠期交易亦見清淡、市面亦出入不多、因天氣仍見陰寒、天時不免尙見變化、抛户遂形减少也、結果六七月份不動、八月份好一分、現麥市情、市上存貨尙厚、惟廠家則因市値過高、無意動辦云、</p>
<h3>米源絡繹市氣帶軟</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源共到八十餘號、（一萬二千餘石（其中以晚稻居多、厚粳後各花色則占少數、而晚稻去路不復似旺、採者僅北洋天津威洋衛等帮、形勢不免稍遜、計其進有青角松泗西練等貨近三千包、而卒以來原太湧、仍呈供超之勢、致各貨乘者尙夥、有二十餘儎、此以客意較餒、吃盤嚴格、售方历欲扳售、乃感棘手、無奈祇有立圖急脫、結果北洋帮雖獨能進有此數、而市况終難免下降、行情貶去五六分、本街方面胃納除晚稻仍見淡泊外、各帮厚粳不復有味、市形猶難振作、所幸到貨較稀、現狀尙能與前相仿、然價格已參差不一、杜洋尖供求雖平、但貨品優劣不等、致價有所不同、除變元銷路不廣、市色轉軟、價遂低落角許、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到埠廿五六號、市上各色消胃平常、市形白粳價小二三分、各尖及變陰元相仿、早稻薄稻又小近角、</p>
<h3>湘贛米來源停頓</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、因近日客北不旺、來源减少、且湘贛兩省米當地倉庫儲囤、近又有軍需收買、故兩省産價均昂、搬運停頓、市上人心已爲向上、適又有福州帮繼續暢辦、浙省温州與本街亦有問訊、市面立卽翻疲爲俏、中關米爲各方歡迎、價砌近角、其他各漲四五分、惟汀贛兩省各擋被貨主板守、統市成交不到千包、交易活潑者仍以蕪湖南京沙市無錫江北各路來貨、　因上述諸路到頭較多、貨主亦急於脫乎也、全市由福州辦去各米六千○七十一包、温州辦去一千二百六十九包、本街辦去五百包、又回籠小絞二百五十包、此票小絞乃係零星小數、售價仍照日前所開六元七角半、較之整票售價爲昂大云、</p>
<h3>黄豆走銷尙旺</h3>
<p>昨黄豆走銷尙見活絡、計開出頴州豆八車、南河豆五車、肥河豆二車、正陽關豆一車及歸油豆五十包、出口有福州厦門兩帮動化、内地德車家採取、本街去化亦不弱、廠家辦胃略形增加、昨成交各豆十一車、在此虛弱局面中、市色尙能帶定、</p>
<h3>糖市漳刁青開出數十包</h3>
<p>昨糖市以各方銷路仍未發展、故人心依然不振、公會劃盤如二四粗砂白十九元八角三分、成交百餘包、八九號嗬赤十五元七角五分、一號本廠綿白振記十八元五角、仁記十八元四角、祗有零星做出、太古Ｂ嘜喊二十元零二角五分、未開、號盤有建帮開漳刁青六十餘包、價爲十元零九角、雜牌統乎茹紛潮帮開四十餘包、價爲七元二角、</p>
<h3>南北貨新枝圓花苗豐歉預測</h3>
<p>據漳州·泉州·安海·同安等處各號來函報稱、本屆新荔枝·新桂圓花苗發育均看歉收、原因係客臘霜雪甚重所致、故上述四處、將來恐祇三分年成耳、興化圓花苗以仙遊縣亦爲去歲霜雪影響、略須减色外、而莆田縣據說未曾殃及、故仍看　收也、瓊州所産海口　去年祇有一二分收成、聞今庚該處吐苗甚茂、此去如無意外、似看七八分年成、廣東菓欄增城之圓扁枝、本年亦看五六成希望云、</p>
<h3>五金大條青鉛重見漲風</h3>
<p>在條青鉛、昨因海外來電報漲、鉛商心思奇好、標凖重見漲風、計每担（天平秤）估十五元、比前高起角半、而大衆喝價、則須十五元二三角不一、交易如黄丹廠·油漆公司·茶樹邦俱有大量吸收、而客帮方面、多因湖南土鉛吃進太多、所以對洋鉛尚無買賣、</p>
<h3>東洋白鐵滿佈全市</h3>
<p>東洋平白鐵、近來又滿佈全市、蓋本埠抵制之風已消、憂國志士已寥、所以一般奸商、又大見活動、而英美貨之白鐵市塲、不得不蒙其重大影響、故標凖迭見下降、茲將最近英美日等貨行情、分誌於下、以資參考、</p>

<h3>絲茶海外華絲無人過問</h3>
<p>▲滬絲廠業岌岌可危　歐美絲織商會因皆絲織品滯銷、縮短工作、减少生産、生絲銷用銳减、更兼日絲濫跌傾銷、故華絲市價一再慘跌、普通滬白廠紐約已跌至四百五六十元、里昂五百二三十元、尙乏人過問滬埠絲廠業岌岌可危、存絲尙厚、無人問訊、類均抵押與金融界、浙屬新繭將次上市、收繭無資、所有資金虧蝕無餘、轉瞬絲繭押欵到期、無欵理償、勢將破産、全滬絲廠一百十三家、現下勉强工作者祇永亨等七家、且均受金融界委托代繅押欵存繭、一侯繅罄、卽行停工云、</p>
<p>▲洋莊絲銷絕望　歐美市塲日絲傾銷益力、絲價逐步慘跌、華絲無人過問、昨祇英法兩莊乘賤補充廠灰二經缺貨、計仁記等進白廠經二十包、灰經五包、價益不振、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>破壞摩登</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>本月二十七日的某報上，突然有一個觸目的血紅木刻標題··「破壞摩登」！上面還有兩個特號鉛字的小題目··「怪團體」，西裝艶服毁千餘件」。吾連忙把報紙拿來打開一看，不禁使吾有些兒毛髮悚然！裏面原來是這麽地說··「杭州二十六日電··杭市有摩登破壞鐵血團發現··二十五日晚開始活動，用鏹水在各游藝場所，密灑男子西裝，女子艶服，二十六日晚，各報接到該團宣言··謂提倡國貨，破壞摩登，活動成績；已毁去摩登服裝一千餘件。社會大爲震驚云······」照上面這一條新聞看來，使吾得到了兩種感想；）一（現社會上，一切都日趨虛榮，尤其是在淫囂繁榮底都市裏，人們都崇尙了奢華的習慣；於是，摩登，摩登底名詞，已成了目前一般時髦人物底一句口頭禪了。但，吾們從摩登二字的字義上解釋起來，那就是『現代』或『近代』的西文譯名。然而，最近幾年來，這兩個字，差不多連吾國底黄毛小子，都已呌得熟之又熟了。這，可見得吾國人中毒之深，實在是不可救藥！</p>
<p>本來，吾們的，高等華人，布爾喬亞着實多得很，雖說中國窮，吾却不相信，那些窮人，都是該死的賤胎。一衣百金，一食十金，有什麽稀罕，眞是没有見過世面。而且，吾國年來歐風日盛，使吾們數千年來頑固的頭腦，也受了它的薰沐而開化起來，漸漸曉得文明了。凡是文明人都應該席豐履厚，廣用洋貨，鄙棄國貨，不然欠就得戴上一個摩登叛徒底頭銜，這多麽地使人慚愧啊？　　因此之故，提倡國貨底聲浪，任你喊得震天價響·而他們依然地拚命提倡洋貨，住洋房，吃大菜，穿洋服，用洋貨，這些在洋塲十里的現代人物，一件也少不了的摩登工作，最近，杭州這「破壞摩登鐵血團」的出現，未免突如其來，大煞風景。</p>
<p>（二）可是話鋒又要拉轉來了；這種行爲終究是不合法的，而且也不道德的。將人家一件好好的衣服，暗地裏把牠硬生生的毁壞，這是何等殘忍底舉動？雖然，他們醉心摩登，罪有應得，似科這裏也可以殺一儆百的給他們下下當頭棒喝；然而在他們底行動上總覺得不大光明，將來不免要引起極大底反感，而使社會底秩序上要受到相當的影響。</p>
<p>目前各内地，各城市，都在提倡新生活運動；這新生活運動底原質，無非是要鼓勵朝野人士一致的起來，崇尙儉樸，遵重道德。禮義廉恥之說，在吾國數千年來素所極爲重視的一件事，現下人心不古，世風澆薄，是以道德淪亡，廉恥喪盡。吾們看到了這種情形··不知將來要成爲一個什麽樣的世界？因此，只好來翻一下陳賬，來舊戲新做，以冀設法挽回這個將頺底世風。那麽，吾們都應該來布衣蔬食地實行這新生活運動，自無疑議的。况且，現在社會的不景氣，到了這般田地，「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨！」吾們怎樣忍心濫吃濫用？人家没有飯吃的，在連糙糖都没得嚥；没有錢用的，在生銅錢癆病，而吾何苦要和金錢去作對，拏牠來毫無交代地揮霍！所以吾底主張··一方面是不需要這種不合法的「怪團體」，省得搗亂社會的安寗。一方面却要希望那些醉心摩登底人們，快快省悟起來，加以自愛，不要儘着抱虛榮主義才好。</p>
<h3>知活的縮寫</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>丨丨爲着一件長衫丨丨</p>
<p>這是一椿幽默的小事體。</p>
<p>自己的身體雖是高個子，但若說吧大，却並不見得。然而製起衣來，却總有些問題。乾脆些說，就是從没有着過一件適大的衣，每每買了够量的布，一做起來，就不中身了。</p>
<p>自己平居考慮，也曾請敎過人家，也曾觀察過别人，以我這樣大的身體，只要買足一丈三尺布，總是够裁够大了</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的。然而事實偏偏不然，做上了身，總是狹窄得像蒙着「牛皮鼓」一樣，綁緊的。</p>
<p>本來受過一次敎訓以後，第二會總得留神，多量三五寸，也就可以聊補不足；但我一到第二會，第三會，一直到現在，買布時却又總是不計及了，伙計問我買多少，我就說一丈三够了吧，伙計也就說一聲好，於是剪回來做好着上身又是小了。</p>
<p>其次呢，因爲環境的關係，做衣總有一種打算，特别是做長衫。</p>
<p>比方，三四月的風凉天氣，跑到三友實業社做件單衫，不說假話，這時候單衫着上身是很合身的。只是秋凉過後，紥上袷襖，還覺得不能禦寒，着棉袍却又還早了。於是乎就把單衫罩上去，必然的，是罩得綁緊的。等到過冬了，反棉袍取出來，照道理，是應新做罩衫的，却又有些說不出的困難，於是也就將單衫再罩上去，於是也就越益顯得小了。</p>
<p>歸根一句，這情形是由錢的關係而候著甚麽衣服，不那樣枝枝節節，這件罩那件。那件套這件，這情形更是隨時可以避免，不在話下。</p>
<p>是兩星期以前了，破題兒第一遭别××公司去定製長衫。天氣還這麽冷，雖在體質綁健的運動家，早已卸裘着輕衣了，而我却還是紥着一件不三不四的灘皮。而灘皮上就是罩着一件單穿的長衫，顯得特别的緊。走了進去，看定了二角八一尺的軟呢，我就呌伙計來問，假使是買布回去雇工做，量一丈三的話，足足要三元六角四分大洋，我一手摸着布頭，歪着頭計量了一會，覺得實在不合算，有些躊躇了，但若說不買了可不行，眞是困窘得很。不知怎樣我却這樣探問一聲··「可以定做麽？」伙計答說··「可以」！「多少錢呢？定做的話，」「三塊五角錢一件」！「那不是强得多麽」！「是的是的」！「那我就定做吧」！於是是開始量尺寸，我生怕又做得太小了，只管連連的說，照灘皮放大一點，長兩寸，寬一寸。伙計全無二話，照樣量好了，</p>
<p>我懷着輕鬆的心走出公司的頭門，只是想，這回可不會小了吧！</p>
<p>上星期取了出來，寬慰的著上身，可眞不小。反而又太大了，長，是挨跟掃，大也大到像袈裟。但我自己總還覺得滿意。</p>
<p>可惱的是一些朋友，見了面，不是喊我做法師，就說我名士化了。唯一的來頭，就是說我爲什麽著一件這樣大的長衫。</p>
<p>於是我又不得不拿去改。</p>
<p>在這裏，有一條哲學的路綫，就是定做衣，我就不怕料子不够，只希望它做得寬大一些，以致又犯了這樣的毛病。</p>
<p>歸根一句，這情形又是由錢的關係而來的。</p>
<p>假若是一件一件的做，不這件套那件，那件又想套這件，這些麻煩，不稱意，是都以避免的。從這裏，我就聯想到許多的幾年來的生活情形，都像做長衫一樣。二十七晚怱寫。（完）</p>
<h3>流浪兒傳（十五）</h3>
<p>— 陳靜生製</p>
<p>漢奸殺了孩子們的媽媽漢奸昧天良，爲的是饑餓愚蠢</p>
<h3>病後</h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>春天到來了，油綠的草，軟軟的，青青的佈滿了地下。樹枝很茂盛的，發生出了嫩芽，一切景物都依舊，輪轉到一個美麗的，還是往常同樣的春的圈套裏。</p>
<p>她整天整天的躺在家裏，生了病。在一間小小的室内，當着没有一個人來時，那末靜寂的時候，停止了一切的哮喘，用盡了所有的氣力，由好整天不離的床上，慢慢的踱着下來，拖上兩片破舊不堪的，棕黄色的拖鞋，走到距離床不遠的，在屋子的中心，對照着側面，所掛在墻壁上的一張素稱爲這室内頭等漂亮的一塊長形照身鏡前，她覺得自己是瘦了，比較在臺上從前所拍的照片，是差得許多。</p>
<p>「啊！怎麽病得現在的身體像這樣」？她抽着一口長長的氣，似乎有些怨着自己的病，是由於自己的不小心所致。</p>
<p>看看鐘，已經是兩點一刻了，正當她每日慣例的午睡醒的時候。她又覺得頭部有些沉重，時而寒冷。</p>
<p>「索性到外邊去走走吧！掙扎着，忍受着自己的病體，向外邊去透透風，也許更因爲這樣，而僥倖的，受一些新鮮的空氣，說不定自己的病，會因此而恢復原狀」······她這樣好似帶着無限的自信力，喃喃的自語着，發出些輕微的聲音。</p>
<p>雖然处從寒冬過來，没有這般好的天氣，可是突然間，一陣狂風猛烈的挾着沙悄從耳邊刮來，似科覺得有一種難言的壓迫，對於她消瘦，孱弱的身體，是有些吃不消啊！</p>
<p>一條馬路漸漸的走完了，轉了一角灣，覺得胸膈間突起着一種新襲進來的舒適，這種感覺，也許在她這樣病體上，是常有的，離奇的病的象徵丨丨時而舒適與時而難過。</p>
<p>汽車開足了馬力，從她的身旁駛過，在她微弱的病體，尙未得到復原的時候，似科覺得汽車，就是一種猛獸似的，正在向她撲擊，使她頓起着一種惡劣的害怕喲！凉風輕微的在她衣襟止鼓舞，打着她的衣襟翻來覆去。</p>
<p>「到什麽地方去呵」！？她暗自埋首沉思着。</p>
<p>病後已經有這許久了，時間眞毫不容情的照樣馳奔着，消逝着。一大羣一大羣的朋友，好像都隨着時日俱逝了，一切朋友的消息和住址，在她病後健忘的腦海裏，却没有一點記憶！</p>
<p>馬路兩旁的樹木，比前更秀麗，整齊的排列着，由一朶一朶的嫩芽，發出了青翠的綠葉，懸掛在枝頭和樹梢。一股野草的香味，塞進她的鼻裏；春天的太陽，有些使人發倦，挾着馬路上汽車駛過時發出的汽油的臭味，愈加令人難嗅的咯咯欲嘔！</p>
<p>在無目的地的這樣徘徊着，終究似乎有些彷徨，平平凡凡的馬路，對她并不起着多少興趣。數月來，各種光怪陸離的貨物，都不堆存得先前那樣起色，蕭條得多了。</p>
<p>傍晚時分，藍的天兩邊掛着一個彷佛失了彈性的血紅的斜陽，路旁的行人，漸漸由稀疏的到没有了，一對對的摩登男女，帶着春遊的倦意，挾着些殘餘的汗珠，盡都在回頭向後轉。這時候，無聊無奈的她，却依舊帶着沉重的心，慢步着，似乎給了她多少鞭打似的回到了家來。</p>
<h3>生活，多平凡呵！</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>生活，多麽的平凡呵！</p>
<p>每天，起來，出去，吃飯，放工，回家，······一切，都是機械式的，然而，誰又能掙脫了這細密的網，而不能要牠呢！</p>

<p>當一個孩子跳出了胞衣，祇會這樣地，這樣地！</p>

<h3>到南京去</h3>
<p>— 柳娜</p>
<p>「到南京去」這個動機在幾年前，已經在腦子裏來回擊蕩着不下千萬次了。</p>
<p>最近去南京這個念頭愈發利害，可以說是已到了沸點，事實方面也是正確到萬分。什麽都預備好了，唯一經濟的恐慌問題已設法好，把我僅僅値得一點錢的一件皮大衣，已拿去當來做路費。並且還約好了朋友，怕在旅途中的寂寞，什麽都想得很周到，就是在明天早上等着呌汽車去車站。</p>
<p>當這個時候，我是怎樣的在快樂着，内心差不多要發狂般的呌出口來，親愛的人們！請你們展開你併怕雙臂吧！不久我就會來到你們面前了。</p>
<p>童時的回憶，一幕一幕的演映在我的眼前··在京戲裏我們所常看見的，那種古典派舊式的老房子，八字門開了一半，裏面露出一個滿面帶着笑容，態度上表示很恭敬的這麽一個老僕人，念着很歡喜的樣子去報告裏面的主人。接着外祖母呌着寳寳，含着慈愛的口吻向前來問長問短，</p>
<p>要吃點什麽呢？啊！你不是很喜歡吃湯嗎？我是深知道的，尤其是你最喜歡吃瘦猪肉墩火腿湯，我來吩咐廚房快點做吧。姨母，舅舅，舅母們，圍繞我的左右讀着笑着，小表弟妹們，帶跳的跑到我的跟前，閙着拉住我的手和衣服要糖吃。年齡相約上下的表姊妹們永不願意分開的互相談論，最要好的那幾家遠親戚的同年友伴，在一塊兒的時候是無一句话不談的，互相之間是没有一點隱藏的私念。</p>
<p>飄蕩了八年生活的我，什麽的一切已非往昔，一切都不是那樣單純了。但不久以前，在分别了八年母親的口裏吐露出來，年齡大點的外祖母已早去天國。姨母，舅舅，舅母們，他們近似中年，境遇的變遷，在他們嘴角上再不能發現一絲的微笑。小表弟妹們，他們一個個都進了中學，已不像從前那樣玩皮活潑天眞了，我想見着你的時候，還要含羞低着頭不肯呌休哩。表姊妹們定親的定親，嫁的嫁了，就是同年的好友，他們有的兒女都過了一大羣。她說完了這一段話後，嘆了口大氣，似乎對我有什麽感慨。</p>
<p>現在當皮大衣的錢，每天吃飯及過活必須費，整票換洋錢，大洋換角子，角子換銅板，一點一點的漸漸用完了。去南京」「去南京」「·······」已成了一個口頭語，可是到現在人還是没有移過窠。時時有朋友問起我來，我仍是回答他們一個··「到南京去」。</p>

<h3>從花柳病說起丨討論</h3>
<p>自從上次發表了鍾谷仁君來信後，在這兩三日内，有許多讀者來函對於這個問題有所發揮，有的歸咎社會，有的又歸咎病者。現在選登兩篇在此。編者自己雖也有一種見解，這時自己還未能十分自信，但却極盼讀者再多多提出意見···老着臉說罷，我是在希望能集思廣益，能下一個比較切合實際，而能爲青年減除些危機的結論呢！　　編者識</p>
<p>編者先生，鄙人昨讀了鍾谷仁君的信，以及編者先生提出的兩個問題··就是『這種危機，「咎在病者，抑在社會」·鄙人不揣愚陋，貢獻一點小意見給讀者研究·鄙人以爲這種危機，咎在社會，而不在病者·因爲性慾是天生的，是不能制止的。古人說，『食色性也』·古人把色看得和食一樣重，所以滿足性慾是人人所必需的·但是上海的社會，他怎樣肯容許你滿足性慾呢？生活程度何等的高，房租何等的貴，做事的人特别的多，他們受到經濟的壓迫，不能在上海組織小家，所以在感到性的極度誘惑時，只有尋花問柳，作他混慾的所在了·雖然明知是危險的；但是怎敵得過他内心的燃燒呢？况且人們都有僥倖心的，假使一次没有遇到毒，下次便以爲無所顧忌了·所謂道德刑罰危險；只能使他恐懼，制止於一時，不能使他永久不發洩的·所以除非剷除賣淫，使人們無處可走，决不能避免這種危險，可是這種辦法，是做不到的··禁止了官賣，私娼仍舊不免。只有請當局特設檢騐局，逐日打針檢騐，始准營業·除此恐無更好的辦法了？</p>

<h3>熱的風（七）</h3>
<p>— 蔡彤華</p>
<p>「肏他娘，這樣的發了財！」阿興也恨。</p>
<p>人們懷着同情的憤怒，替順興叔抱不平。豐伯望不到雲甫老爺的用人，他用舌尖舐着乾燥的下唇，吞下一口口水「禍從口出，各事當心，錢是血是汗，我看的够了。」</p>
<p>「這還成世界」！</p>
<p>「做人不如做狗」！</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>「叱叱······沙沙······」雜沓的脚步聲，彷彿是行軍時的步伐令人心悸的步伐從遠處傳來，打破了夜的死寂；沈睡着的村犬跳起來便汪汪的亂呌，這家響應那家，全村的狗都直着嗓子在吠。夜鶯也從樹梢驚醒哀啼。這混雜着的喧囂踐蹈進村裏每個人的心靈，人們尖着矇矓的耳朶，屏着氣的在傾聽着外面這突如其來的噪亂。</p>
<p>「叱叱······沙沙······」更清晰而響亮。</p>
<p>「嗚嗚······嗚嗚······」不安的絕呌，使人聽見了便立刻知道牠們在恐佈的掙扎中。這時，還時着小孩子們從睡夢中驚醒了的嚎啕。</p>
<p>「什麽呢？」這突變使阿興摸不到頭腦，他焦急的把臉孔貼到門縫向外張望，但什麽也没有看見，黑漆漆地，只是那可怕的聲音更加近而響，阿興咬着下唇，緊緊地鑽着眉峯。母親像在嚴冬的寒夜顫拦着，牙齒互碰着，跪到地上去，扁着嘴顫着聲。妹妹呢，呆着，那黯灰色的眼睛，像求救盤的　着哥哥和母親。</p>
<p>「硼硼······硼硼硼······」挾雜着「天哪······」的喊聲，哭聲。</p>
<p>「菩蕯······保······保佑······土······土······」母親極力的支撑着身體，亂翻着東西，於是布袋裏的布碎丢到地上，玻珫璃罇滾到地下，碎了，假使别時，母親會駡一駡自己，含着婉惜的情緒把他拾起，等着賣爛東西的來，現在，她只像小偸的亂望着，亂搜着，檢着。</p>

<p>中國的電影</p>
<h3>卽此因環境的壓迫而停止了嗎？</h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>中國電影，目前正逢到了一個極嚴重的難關。</p>
<p>和其他情形一樣，中國電影，是跟着社會的進展而進展。社會的客觀條件，决定一切，决定了中國電影。可是這進步到最近却忽然停止了。社會仍是不斷的向前走，而電影却停留了下來。這是一個多麽可悲慘的事呵。</p>
<p>中國電影的興起，還不過是近十餘年的事。十年之前，那時中國電影剛剛發軔，所表現出來的，不過是一些舊式公子哥兒的故事，或是封建的敎訓。再不然，就是抄襲一些外國尤其是美國電影的唾餘表現一些不純熟的畸形東西。這是中國電影的第一期。</p>
<p>第一期的末葉，正當中國農村極度破産，軍閥，官僚，苛捐，雜稅，兵災，水災，旱災等等，以及一切國際帝國主義的經濟網絡極度剥削着中國農村之時。一般人困頓在極茺貧困之下，輾轉呼號，没有出路。由於歷代封建歷史的敎訓，使他們知道只有少數人的俠義英雄行爲，是可以稍稍打破現狀的。於是，七俠五義，七劍十三之類的俠客義士，便都搬到銀躉上來了。這時期可謂是中國電影第二期。</p>
<p>經過這一極端没落的反動期，中國電影又有了一綫的新生希望。這便是中國電影漸由極端没落的反動期而進入於另一新時代。這一時代，不獨完全擺脫了從前的封建臭味，而且完全擺脫了從前畸形都市的惡濁形態，趨過目前已經没落的社會文明，而接近到一個更新的社會。經過這一個轉變，中國電影，才眞正開始踏進了勃興的境域。這可以說是第三期。</p>
<p>自然，中國電影這一轉變，决不是憑空而來的，而是由於一定的社會客觀條件所决定。這一社會客觀條件，就是中國社會經過最近二十餘年來的變遷，一般人民，已經漸由糢糊的悲嘆與憤慨而漸進到積極的努力與鬭爭了。消極的退讓，盲目的攻擊，至此已都不適用歷史的敎訓，使他們知道怎樣去更清楚的認識社會，更正確的採取有效而有力的手段去和客觀環境奮鬭·這一切，才使中國電影，在最近期内，不得不相應社會的客觀需要，而由腐敗没落的深淵向前有了這一個大飛躍。</p>
<p>以上是中國電影最近十年來由發軔以至發達的過程。從這過程，我們可知，中國電影，是怎樣因應抱社會的客觀需要而由發生以至於興盛。社會不斷的前進，電影也不斷的前進；社會的客觀條件，决定了一切，也决定了社會這情形，我們是可以瞭然無疑的了。</p>
<p>然則，中國電影，今後仍將以加速的步武向前邁進嗎？當然，這是必然的結論。而在現在，中國電影，却發生了從前未有的突然停滯的現象。這現象所表示出來的中國電影由内容的充實而有力變成了異常的空虛和瑣碎。不信，只要連續看幾部最近新出的中國片子，和不久以前中國電影内容作風剛剛轉變後的作品，比較一下，便能得到異常不滿意的感覺。這爲什麽呢？中國電影顯然是因爲某種特殊原因而走在停止的途上了。</p>
<p>那末，中國電影的今後出路在那里呢？中國電影所以能和外國影片爭衡，這也完全由於牠的内容充實之一點，能抓得住中國社會的核心；而今還一點也没有了，中國電影今後將以何種實質貢獻於社會一般觀衆之前呢？外國電影尤其是美國電影，雖是腐敗没落，然而牠還有偉大的布景可賣，還有繁華熱閙可賣，中國電影賣些什麽呢？這是一個値得我們討論的嚴重底問題。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「旖旎風光」</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>ＳonofASailor丨南京丨</p>
<p>「旖旎風光」雖然是一個水兵獨任了全劇的主角，而且很多的描寫了水兵的生活，但並没有如我們所想像的那樣能够暴露水兵生活的實際。</p>
<p>水兵們的漂流的海上生活，同兵房裏的生活儘管怎樣差異，但是因爲近代國嗳之所以需要龐大的軍隊，無非是要維持市民階級的支配，而極力造成一種建築在愚昧與奴隸觀念上的的謂「紀律」，却反把士兵生活的改善置諸不顧，結果，在市民階級國家的軍隊中，性的苦悶便普遍地發展於下層的那廣大的士兵羣衆中。這可以用來解番失了統馭的士兵，爲什麽一般的總是狂暴地要求性慾的滿足。</p>
<p>這種苦悶，在日常生活中，也隨時隨地流露出來，「旖旎風光」曾用了詼諧與譏笑，描冩了士兵的這種苦悶。然而第一，它只只爲了引逗觀衆發笑，至多它是嘲弄了没有「獵艶」天才的一部分士兵，它絕不提起士兵的性的苦悶更不可忽視，也絕不提起這種苦悶之所由來，更不要說到士兵的新生活問題之提出。就是「旖旎風光」現在所寫的一點點士兵的性的苦悶，完全給詼諧與什麽「艶遇」弄歪曲了。</p>
<p>主角漢得生的個性，是喜歡誇大崦有機變的。如在他拳擊之時，雖失敗尙不甘屈服，然又自知不敵，終於詐勝。又如誇張他艶史，在海倫家誇張他的榮譽等處，以及其他許多瑣細的地方都能表現出他的個性，這是演員喬埃勃郥勢力的結果。在而從作品的整體來看，許多的表現都嫌過火，胡閙。眞的，如果說「旖旎風光」是一部充滿了無意義的胡閙塲面的惡劣作品，一點也不過分的。</p>
<p>我們更要指出，漢得生的那種英雄觀念，艶遇和結束的那一個戰爭的鼓動，完全是相配合的。</p>
<p>市民階級畜養了龐大的軍隊，更因爲國際資本主義的戰爭要求，在他們的士兵中培植了純粹空想的英雄觀念，而以什麽「艶遇」來把受壓迫的士兵生活粉飾起來，把士兵的思想都曳引進英雄觀念的泥坑中去。</p>
<p>「旖旎風光」的高潮，用了在空中翻身的飛機，受轟炸的危險，達到了極度刺激觀衆的目的；攝影方面，亦頗可觀。</p>
<h3>評「健美運動」·凌鶴·</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Search　For　Beauty丨大光明</p>
<p>我不懂像這樣的影片是否應名爲體育影片？但是這影片確是以體育爲題材的。</p>
<p>當劇作者要在影片中提出所謂健美運動，而且要自圓其說的時候，他首先必須指斥目前書報商人之以體育運動爲號召而從中牟利爲不合理。關於這一點，我們並不忽視現社會之任何事物的商品化。這是資本主義社會的特徵。畫報商人請世界運動會的選手做編輯，是號召讀者最好的方法。更進一步的登載裸體照片或淫邪文字，這些，在目前都是司空見慣，不足爲奇。也許我們可以聽見不少道學先生爲之搖頭嘆氣，槪嘆世風日下。但是這理却提出了男女青年應當自己振作，不爲奸商所利用。劇作者認爲應當提倡的是建築體育館，並且堂皇其辭的要使運動大衆化。</p>
<p>在這裏我們應當注意的是體育運動的眞實意義。不消說，運動會或足球名將的比賽，必須和回力球或跑馬跑狗一樣的賣門票，賭輸贏，這便證明了所謂體育運動之資本主義化，而運動員亦不過是變相的商品而已。而現代國家之提倡運動或者是以巨欵供養少數運動員之生活，更有其政治的麻醉作用。所以，我們認定所謂眞正的體育運動，决不是從我們身上拿錢出來造成幾個選手的英雄，而是要使廣大的民衆（包括婦女兒童）受着體育訓練。因此我們决不反對運動大衆化。</p>
<p>大錯，「健美運動」的作者是以「運動大衆化」爲藉口的。但是我們在影片上所看出的作者之意識形態，却是使紳士淑女們不要空自羡慕運動選手之健美的體格，特别是怪好聽的反對肉感跳舞，而敎他們或她們也受着體育的訓練，過着所謂紀律的生活。此所謂之運動大衆化乎？至於將團體操美化起來而成爲歌舞塲面，雖然這是影片的花樣，但在體育館中劇作者如此幻想着，不知道又應作解釋？</p>
<p>毫舞疑義的，劇作者决不會否認運動的商業化，體育館也無非是進步的營業商店。這裏充分的展開了作者之意識上的矛盾。不，也許這並非務盾，前面他反對以女運動員之肉體爲雜誌資料，不過是使運動更進一步的商業化罷了。</p>
<p>如今，眞是稀奇的世界，聰明人常常一方面攻擊某一不合理現象，同時另一方面却又讚美這一現象，使其成爲對於自己有利的東西，而在這矛盾中生活下去。派拉蒙本身就是極好的例證，他出重資聘請世界運動會的游泳選手爲電影演員，不是和請選手爲體育畫報的編輯一樣可笑嗎？</p>
<p>以上我以爲决不是無味的閒話。現在不妨再就技術上說到一些。關於這一點，我們一點也不過份的說，這在美國影片中有此成績，實在不足爲奇。和其他的美國影片一樣，這裏有輕鬆的對話，有生硬的噱頭，有妖艶的跳舞，有堂皇的歌劇塲面。使你發笑，使你快樂，但是它僅僅是娛樂而空虛的作品而已。</p>
<h3>一九三三年好萊塢的十大巨片</h3>
<p>— 史鶴琴</p>
<p>好萊塢在每年新年開始的時候，除熱烈選舉十大明星外，還有一件事情，就是選舉十大巨片，其盛况不亞於選舉十大明星。且因那邊各大影片公司出品多，一年中産出來的片子，何止數千部。在這麽許多片子裏面，選出十部片子來，牠的名貴，可想而知了。</p>
<p>去年的十大巨片，由精密的選舉下，最近已在好萊塢電影日報中發表了。當選的十大巨片是「亂世春秋」（Ｃavalcade），「四十二街」（４２ndStreet），「英宮艶史」（PrivateLifeofHenryVlll），「賽珍會」（StateFair），「女性之光」（MaedcheninUniform），「戰地情天」（FarewelltoArm），「地獄天使」（SheDoneHimNoWrong），（以上七部巨片是都曾在上海開映遇，還有三部因没有在上海公映過，所以没有譯名，祇好把他們的英文名字冩在下面，）LadyForaDay,IamaFugitiveFromaChainGang,RasputintheEmpress·在這十部片子裏面，多半都是全體明星合演的，偈「亂世春秋」，「四十二街」「賽珍會」等片。其中最難得的是三個新明星主演的片子，也列入十大巨片之列。一部是却爾斯拉夫登主演的「英宮艶史」，一部是桃樂賽維克主演的「女性之光」，還有一部是梅惠絲脫主演的「地獄天使」。新進的人材能有這樣超絕的作品，這不能不使我們佩服好萊塢具有天才演員的衆多了！</p>
<p>最可惜的是一部巴里摩亞三兄妹合演的拉斯浦丁，已經運到了上海，因遭租界嘗局禁映，到底不能和海上人士在銀幕上見面，這是非常値得婉惜。</p>

<h3>喀羅蘭那（Carolina）（八）</h3>
<p>— 文印</p>
<p>羅伯走了，威爾說道··「可憐的老頭子，簡捷活著受罪······他已是殘毁之軀了······」瓊娜殷殷啜泣着，那一晚的事情，實在太爲難她了。威爾將她摟着，送她回家去。他們一言不發地走著。威爾自己的心神，亦太亂了，因爲佛琴妮和他講了許多怎樣整理那地方的話。當然重整家業，恢復舊觀，是件很可喜的事，但是瓊娜怎樣呢？他低頭看着她，那種處女神秘的美，一直印到他心坎的最深處。瓊那到了小莊房的門口，她羞答答和威爾道了晚安。威爾突然間抱住她說道··「瓊娜，寳貝，我愛你。明天一早，第一件事我要做的，就是到這裏來。好不好？你愛我嗎？」瓊娜的心，勃勃地跳躍起來，她低聲說道··「我是很喜歡你的。」威爾道··「爲什麽你不說愛我呢？」瓊娜道··「現在還没有到時候，請你不要强迫我」威爾没有法子，祇好將她放了，和她約好了明天一早，就讓她走進去了。</p>
<p>瓊娜走進了屋子，威爾聽着她很快的脚步走上樓梯的聲音，他忽然間情不自禁起來，他覺得他還要看她一看。他在屋外喊道··「瓊丨娜！」瓊娜在樓上，開了一扇窗，伸出一個頭來呌他不要響，要拿她的弟弟驚醒了。那屋子前面，有一顆大樹，威爾一聳身，就跳上了那顆樹往上爬。瓊娜倒抽了一口氣，很害怕似的問道··「這做什麽呀」？可是威爾已爬到瓊那的窗外了。他們一個在樹枝上，一個坐在窗檻上，兩個人摟起來吻着。威爾是滔滔不絕地訴說他的愛。瓊娜倒在他的懷裏，閉上了眼睛，好像月光照着她的眼睛，使它睜不開了，又好像花園裏浮起來的花香，使她熏醉了。威爾呌她說她愛他，她就說她愛他，並且兩臂鈎住了威爾的頸項，和他深深地吻着···吻着。</p>
<p>明天一早威爾就起來了。他就尋着瓊娜，重新訴說一切的歡愛。等到他回到家裏，康納萊夫人已在等候他了。她看見她兒子那種高興的神氣，已經明白了是什麽原因。她說昨天晚上，她等到四點鏡，他還没有進屋子。但她没有再說下去，就換了題目。她告訴他說，銀行裏的透支，已經不能再擱下去了······因此，她已經和佛琴妮商量過，她願意將押欵接受過來，而再作一筆新押欵。她呌威爾立卽就到查爾士頓，佛琴妮的銀行裏去簽訂合同。威爾聽見了他母親要呌他出門，就紅漲了臉，急了半天說不出話來，後來他說··「今天不興，我還有······一些事没有辦完。」但是他母親很堅决地道··「我時間已經和人家定規好了，你怎能失約呢？」老羅伯跑了進來，他對康納萊夫人板着的臉看看，又對着威爾尶𡯓的面孔張張，他忽然笑了起來。他說··「好一幅母慈子孝的圖盡呀！今天有什麽新聞？」康納萊夫人道··今天威爾到查爾士頓去。」威爾連忙說道··「我没有說我一定去呀。」（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying wrote a letter to He Yingqin saying, "I obeyed orders and left the troops with Representative Fu. I arrived in Baotou on the 26th. Please release the dependents. After I left the troops, the address I stayed at was in accordance with the telegram, and Chief of Staff Li brought the handwritten note, all ordering me to choose my own place to stay in various places in Taiyuan and Ping Sui after leaving the troops. I am grateful for the care. I plan to go to Taiyuan to stay temporarily, and then go to Beiping to pay my respects.

<h3>Candidate for Governor of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Chen Jitang Proposes...</p>
<p>Lin Yungai and Lin Yizhong</p>
<p>)Nanjing( Guangdong Province seems to have no objection to the provincial government system reform, but regarding the issue of the candidate for governor after the reform, it is said that President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Chairman Jiang each sent telegrams to Chen Jitang, expressing their opinions. Generally, after the provincial government system reform, each province will have a security department, and the public security bureau will also be changed to a police department. The central government will not send anyone else to serve as the governor, but will appoint a senior official from Guangdong nearby. In general, a vigorous and strong literati is the best choice. It is said that Chen of Guangdong believes that only Lin Yungai and Lin Yizhong in Guangdong can take on this task. Although they are not talented in both civil and military affairs, they are also capable. It is proposed to suggest that the central government choose one to appoint. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang and Li Zongren expressed their strong approval of the issue of abolishing the two southwest agencies, in order to unify the central party and government system. However, Hu Zhantang still expressed his disagreement, so this matter has not been decided. As for the establishment of a military branch association in the southwest, it must wait until the two agencies are abolished before it can be established. (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Significance of Changing Hawaii from a Territory to a State · Ting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I heard that the representative of Hawaii to the Washington Congress proposed to change the territory into a state. The reporter lived in the area for many years and has a detailed understanding. I deeply know the importance of this case. Therefore, I drafted this article to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1898, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives jointly resolved to merge the Hawaiian Islands. The islands are located in the center of the Pacific Ocean and have a strategic position. After the Americans merged, they actively managed and spared no effort. Pearl Harbor near its capital, Honolulu, is one of the largest military ports in the world. The scale of the Schofield Barracks army camp is also the first in the United States. Therefore, many Americans call it the first defense line in the west. Americans attach so much importance to Hawaii, so it should not be regarded as a territory for a long time. Why has the statehood issue not been realized until now? The main key lies in the diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States, and in order to explain it further, it is necessary to briefly explain the nature of American colonies.</p>
<p>According to past American history, whenever a colony joins the territory, if the number of people is too small, the area is too small, and the education level of the people is not enough to talk about autonomy, it is regarded as a dependency, such as the Samoa Islands and Guam. If the colony has an important location or a considerable area and population, but its people and environment have not yet reached the level of self-government, it is called a Territory. Both dependencies and territories are directly under the rule of the federal central government. However, territories are divided into Incorporated and Non-incorporated. Incorporated territories are an integral part of the United States in domestic law. Once the time is ripe, Congress is willing to accept it as one of the states. Before changing to a state, the people generally enjoy the protection and rights of the federal constitution. Once a territory is incorporated, it can never be separated. Even the president and Congress have no right to allow it to break away from the shackles of the central government. Non-incorporated territories are not like this. The people do not enjoy all the rights and protections of the federal constitution. In domestic law, it does not become an integral part of the United States. Therefore, the president and Congress have the right to allow it to become independent. Today, the American president and Congress can allow the Philippines to become independent within a limited time, but they cannot allow Hawaii and Alaska to become independent. The reason lies here. Because the scope of the rights of the federal constitution enjoyed by the people is different, those born in the Philippines are only called "Nationals" of the United States (the word "National" is a concoction of the reporter, please do not mess with the meaning of the constitution), while those born in Hawaii are all American citizens.</p>
<p>Since Hawaii is an incorporated territory and is directly under the central government in Washington, the governor is appointed by the president and not elected locally. The governor can submit the resolutions of the elected legislature for reconsideration, and the scope of reconsideration can be freely considered. The executive and legislative branches check and balance each other to carry out government affairs.</p>
<p>Why is the main key to changing the territory to a state in the diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States? The Hawaiian Islands have an area of 6,449 miles. The current population is about 400,000, and Japanese immigrants and their descendants alone account for more than 100,000, about one-third of the total. According to the principles of American nationality law and the constitutional status of Hawaii, all those born in the United States are generally called citizens, regardless of their origin. Therefore, Japanese "native-born" children have the right to vote, be elected, and other various civil rights when they reach the legal age. The United States is an emerging country, and the ethnic composition within the country is the most complex. "Native-born" Japanese children are protected by the constitution, and no one can drive them out of the country or deprive them of their civil rights. However, according to Japanese nationality law, they are still Japanese citizens. Their identity is not different due to their place of birth. The issue of cross-nationality arises. Recently, there have been reports of "native-born" Japanese in Hawaii voluntarily declaring their withdrawal from Japanese citizenship, but the proportion of the total number is very small.</p>
<p>If "native-born" Japanese are easily assimilated by the United States, or Japan's national spirit does not invade others, it is also unnecessary for the Americans to be frightened and worried. Like things attract each other, and people are also like that. Honolulu has always been proud of its melting pot of races, but the yellow-skinned boundary is clearly visible. Students, or innocent, or inexperienced, should be the least prejudiced against each other. However, I have visited the highest academic institutions in the area and deeply feel that the boundaries between various races are still not eliminated. When the Manchurian Incident occurred, public opinion was in an uproar. Every time someone defends the Japanese side and deliberately makes insincere remarks, they are all the sons and grandsons of those wearing wide sleeves and clogs. The Japanese are very united and rarely marry people of other races. In the past, Japanese immigrants in California accumulated surplus savings and wanted to have a good home. They asked the country to find photos of women of the same age. If they liked them, they would pay to welcome them and live together. There are many Japanese in Hawaii, and it is easier to communicate with each other for marriage. The teaching time of local public schools is generally from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., while Japanese schools teach from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Each Japanese school is well-equipped and has strict rules. Most of the teachers are hired from Japan, and it is said that there are lower-ranking military officers mixed in among them, only using teaching as a cover, but having other intentions. All "native-born" Japanese children can speak Japanese and are familiar with Japanese. A few years ago, the local authorities planned to implement a ban, but the Japanese reacted greatly. The case involved constitutional interpretation. After the judgment of the Supreme Court, the freedom to teach and read cannot be deprived. The authorities lost the lawsuit and swallowed their anger. The Japanese are very devout Buddhists. There are many temples on the Hawaiian Islands. Devout men and women worship without decline. Freedom of religion is clearly defined in the constitution and cannot be interfered with. Try to visit the homes of local Japanese people. The arrangement and equipment are all very similar to their homes in the country. Portraits of the emperor and empress are often prominently displayed. The first thing that catches the eyes of guests. Walking through the streets and alleys, there are seventeen or eight shops operated by Japanese people. Being in it is almost the same as the three islands of Fusang. In the current situation, it is not surprising that the Americans are uneasy. Moreover, the Japanese have been plotting for a long time to succeed. The competition for naval power in the Pacific Ocean, except for the United States, is not enough to pay attention to. The reporter has experienced the American-controlled area of ​​the Panama Canal and the Sangang Los Angeles in California. The spread of Japanese power is also ubiquitous. The Americans have never regarded it as a hidden danger. Once a police warning occurs, it is easy to resist the invasion of foreign enemies, but it is difficult to prevent internal sabotage. That is, without formal engagement between the two countries, the disaster arises from the domestic strife, which is already unimaginable. Since the September 18th Incident, the Americans have been more vigilant than usual. In Honolulu's overlapping evening clouds, electric torches are often seen shooting in all directions, with intersecting rays. The red and green lights shimmer vaguely, like the movement of cold stars. Something is stirring up the static atmosphere, with a slight rumble. It is the American naval and air force practicing flying at night. What is the purpose? It goes without saying. The reporter also heard that there is no "native-born" Japanese serving in the Schofield Barracks military camp with 20,000 troops. It can be imagined that the Americans are protecting themselves so thoroughly.</p>
<p>All of the above is to explain the significance of changing Hawaii to a state and then determine that it is not easy to realize. After all, after the territory is changed to a state, the governor and the legislature are all elected by the people. In recent years, there are still many Japanese residents who are not native-born or have no voting rights. Therefore, they cannot be important during the election period. However, the expansion of their power is already alarming. In a few years, the young children who are underage today will successively reach the voting age. The longer it lasts, the more there will be. It is inevitable that they will manipulate the election. Moreover, in the Senate and House of Representatives in Washington, after the territory is changed to a state, there will be many official Hawaiian members attending. Compared with today's one representative who only has the right to attend but no right to vote, the difference in power is also incomparable. That is, Japanese power will also penetrate into the federal government and will not be limited to a corner of Hawaii. At that time, the central government will be helpless due to the federal political system and the constitution. Changing a territory to a state is possible, but a state downgrading to a territory is not possible. Because the matter violates the constitution.</p>
<p>In the current system, although the governor of Hawaii is appointed by the president with the consent of the Senate, the candidate must be a resident of the area for at least three years according to law. Last year, President Roosevelt asked Congress to allow him to send people freely, without being subject to the above restrictions. However, the bill was shelved in the Senate after passing the House of Representatives. Whatever Roosevelt's direct motive for requesting the change, it is unnecessary to discuss. It is clear that he wants to make the relationship between Hawaii and the central government closer. Now, Hawaiian Representative McKendrees intends to propose changing the territory to a state to counter the central government. This is clearly contrary to Roosevelt's intention. In today's situation where the diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States are uncertain, it can be said that it cannot be easily successful. According to the reporter's speculation, McKendrees still loves the seat of governor after being elected as a representative, which has caused a lot of criticism. This time, he resolutely proposed the statehood bill, or to win back a part of the people's hearts. It is unknown. However, if for some incredible reason, the bill becomes law, a major change will occur in the Pacific situation. We should not ignore it because it is a matter of American internal affairs. When the United States merged Hawaii, the Japanese protested by using the excuse of destroying the current situation in the Pacific. Americans are so forgetful. In the past 36 years, it has been possible to change the territory to a state at any time, but the change has not been realized. Most Americans will be rejoicing. How can they rashly do this today? According to the reporter's speculation, McKendrees still loves the seat of governor after being elected as a representative, which has caused a lot of criticism. This time, he resolutely proposed the statehood bill, or to win back a part of the people's hearts. It is unknown. However, if for some incredible reason, the bill becomes law, a major change will occur in the Pacific situation. We should not ignore it because it is a matter of American internal affairs.</p>

<h3>The Situation Deteriorates Again</h3>
<p>Miners March with Weapons</p>
<p>Unauthorized Arrests and Brutal Beatings</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Dares Not Intervene</p>
<p>Zhao Dazhong Speaks Publicly and Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 29th, over a thousand Kailuan Tangshan miners, because the Public Security Bureau had not fulfilled its promise to allocate 11,000 yuan for injury and death compensation, gathered in front of the labor union with guns and sticks, and set off on a march at 2 PM, shouting protest slogans along the way. The Public Security Bureau, fearing it would incite an incident, dared not stop them. They dispersed at 6 PM. The labor unrest situation has turned for the worse. At 5 PM on the 29th, Zhao Dazhong gathered the workers in front of the Caishen Temple to give a public speech. He said that all workers must unite as one and persevere to the end. If the mine does not fulfill the conditions, they will never resume work. The General Union of Workers’ Autonomous Organizations in the War Zone posted various slogans on the 29th: 1. Down with the Mining Bureau that deceives workers and does not fulfill contracts; 2. We swear not to resume work if the contract is not fulfilled; 3. We will use reasonable and courageous means to deal with the Mining Bureau. A declaration was also issued, stating: In this era of rampant communist ideology, workers are often tempted (omitted). Considering this, this union has brought together 150,000 workers in the war zone to establish a united autonomous labor union, with worker autonomy as its ultimate goal, adhering to the principle of labor-capital cooperation to eliminate human disputes, uphold the benevolent conscience of loving others to eliminate the root of social unrest. In our war zone, there are numerous factories and the most mining areas, with hundreds of thousands of laborers. In the past, they were fooled by unscrupulous elements or used by various parties. From now on, all workers of this union will abide by the spirit of autonomy, seek the interests of the masses, and those who oppose the union will be anti-humanitarian and anti-justice. This union will fight them to the end. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

Zhao Dazhong sent people to drag him away, hang him from the rafters, and beat him for a whole day and night, but still did not release him. The Public Security Bureau, fearing the power of the workers, dared not ask. Zhao Dazhong sent people to Zhou's house and found a letter from Liu Jungge to Zhou, in which he instructed Zhou to find someone to assassinate Zhao with 2,000 yuan as a reward. Zhao was even more unwilling to release Zhou hastily. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Supervisory Yuan Against Gu Renfa</p>
<h3>Preparing to File Impeachment</h3>
<p>Investigators Have Departed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Seven members of the Supervisory Committee, including Liu Eqing, had a joint discussion on the Gu Renfa impeachment case and raised three points of view: (1) According to the advertisement published by Gu, Li Shuyun stole his official seal and solicited money. Considering Gu as the civil affairs director of a province, his official seal being stolen and used by Li Shuyun is a major matter. Gu himself failed in his duties and should bear full responsibility. (2) Li Shuyun instigated the director of the Public Security Bureau to resist the transfer. If the reason for this was solely because she relied on her husband being the civil affairs director, then Gu should also be responsible. (3) Li Shuyun accused Gu of bigamy, which caused a stir in the newspapers. Gu is an administrative official, and if he is indeed guilty of bigamy, his crime is even greater. After consultation, because accurate evidence is still needed, it was decided to send two personnel to Zhenjiang and Wuxi to secretly investigate immediately. According to a certain Supervisory Committee member, the Supervisory Yuan has recently received many reports from various parties regarding Gu's collusion with his wife Li Shuyun in buying and selling official positions, along with various newspapers and evidence relating to the Gu-Li incident. These have been incorporated into the discussion results and summarized into a case, which will be investigated first and then proposed for impeachment. The investigators have already departed and will obtain a detailed report within a few days. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) It is widely rumored here that Gu Renfa has submitted his resignation to the authorities, but officials are still denying it. Gu was absent from the provincial government meeting on the 30th due to leave. According to sources close to officials, Gu has been very passive recently and his spirits have been greatly distressed. The resignation is being drafted. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>What is Japan's Intention?</p>
<h3>Deadly Germs Smuggled to America</h3>
<p>Seized by Philadelphia Customs</p>
<p>Attached to Toy and Cracker Packaging</p>
<p>American Agricultural Products to Suffer Greatly</p>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, customs authorities in Philadelphia (a major city in the eastern United States) seized the most unusual items in goods smuggled in from Japan. Today, the results of research by experts from the Department of Agriculture revealed that there were various poisonous insects, lice, fungi, microorganisms, and cotton bacteria attached to them. According to reports from the experts, if these bacteria and insects are allowed to multiply in the United States, American agricultural products will be greatly harmed, and the amount of loss is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The damage may be even more severe in the southern regions with warmer climates. These microorganisms were brought from Japan, attached to the wrappers of Japanese-made toy crackers and food products, as well as cotton pads and rice straws. Americans do not yet know the names of these bacteria and insects, but they often cause Japanese agricultural products to wither, which shows a glimpse of their harm. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Konoe to Visit America in May</p>
<h3>To Negotiate Diplomacy and Disarmament</h3>
<p>Various Observations in Japanese Political Circles</p>
<p>Hirota Again Sends Compliments to America</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Duke Konoe Fumimaro, Speaker of the House of Peers, who will visit the United States in May, said at his villa in Kamakura on the afternoon of the 29th: "My purpose in visiting the United States is to deal with private matters and there are no official matters. However, before departing, I will meet with Prince Saionji, Prime Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Hirota, Admiral Osumi, and others to hear the government's opinions on diplomatic and disarmament issues, so that I can exchange views temporarily in the United States. After staying in the United States for three months, I may travel to Europe." (30th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Various quarters in the political world have made various observations regarding Duke Konoe Fumimaro's visit to the United States. Some believe that the visit of the highly positioned and renowned Duke Konoe to the United States to convey Japan's pro-American policies to American officials and celebrities and to explain Japan's position on "Manchukuo" is of great significance at this important juncture of the 1931-1936 situation. Others believe that Duke Konoe's visit to the United States is a prelude to becoming Japan's chief plenipotentiary candidate for the 1935 Washington Naval Conference. Still others have internal observations, saying that this is proof that the current cabinet is maintaining its power, because such an important figure as Duke Konoe will travel overseas from May to September, which must have been understood by Prince Saionji long ago, and it is also sufficient to prove that the Saito Cabinet is determined to supplement its members and compile a budget to face the next session of the Diet. Yesterday, Duke Konoe told reporters that he had this idea of ​​visiting the United States ten years ago, initially thinking of attending his son Fumihiko's graduation ceremony. However, since he is going to the United States, he also wants to exchange opinions with various parties. Although he is going to the United States for private matters, he is very happy if it is beneficial to the country. He expects to return home before September in order to attend the temporary Diet on rice countermeasures. (30th Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, due to the exchange of notes between Hirota and Hull, Japan and the United States are about to start resolving outstanding issues. However, the current diplomatic issues and the attitude towards next year's disarmament will be discussed after Ambassador Saito returns home in June and has important consultations with Foreign Minister Hirota, and then he will resume his post. It is scheduled to begin the Japan-US preparatory consultations in September. (30th Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Eighty years ago, on March 30, American Admiral Perry first came to Uraga, Japan, and signed the so-called Kanagawa Treaty with the Japanese authorities. This was the first step in Japan's relations with foreign countries. Various Japanese groups and Japanese overseas organizations in the United States held a commemorative meeting today for the 80th anniversary of Japan-US diplomatic relations. Foreign Minister Hirota sent the following statement to the United States on the 29th: "Eighty years have passed since the beginning of Japan-US diplomatic relations. Although there have been times of tension due to misunderstandings, it is still a great pleasure to maintain friendly relations today. It is of great significance that the people of the two countries are holding a commemorative festival today. I sincerely hope that the two countries will work together to maintain peace forever in order to realize the Pacific era." (30th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to smooth the commercial relations between Japan and the United States, the Japan-US Trade Association has already been established in New York, and the domestic agency is chaired by the Economic Federation to echo it. Therefore, the Economic Federation will invite Horinouchi Kensuke, Director of the Research Department, who will return from the United States in May, to listen to the establishment process of the Japan-US Trade Association and then decide on future policies. In the future, foreigners can also join as guest members or associate members of the Economic Federation. (30th Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Japanese Goods Shipped to India</p>
<h3>Circumventing the India-Japan Agreement</h3>
<p>Italy Will Request Modification of Clauses Against India</p>
<p>Bombay - According to the newly revised Indo-Japanese commercial agreement, the monthly import quota of Japanese cotton textiles to India is fixed. However, according to what is known here, Japan is using clever means to circumvent the agreement's clauses. The method is to ship cotton textiles from Manchuria, and the bill of lading is made in Dalian. In this way, it is possible to ship goods that can only be sold in three months to India within one month. It is also a good plan. In addition, since the signing of the Indo-Japanese agreement, the sales of Italian cotton textiles in India have been practically blocked. In retaliation, the Italian government plans to impose tariffs on Indian cotton. Cotton industry insiders here are extremely shocked by the news. They are currently studying what methods can be used to restore Indian cotton to its original position in the Italian market, and propose that the Indo-Japanese agreement be revised.

<h3>Land Minister Hayashi Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Intervention Still Needed in Urgent Matters</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The conference of army division commanders, which lasted for three days, ended on the 29th. This conference has attracted much attention from various quarters because it can give a glimpse of the army's attitude. Land Minister Hayashi expressed the army's attitude towards the current situation at the meeting, saying that there are various rumors about the army's attitude in the world, but the army has not considered establishing a National Policy Council after the end of the Diet to force the government to implement fundamental national policies. Also, the army does not want to take such an attitude, but exchanging opinions with the Prime Minister and other cabinet members on national defense issues and coordinating implementation methods are naturally necessary matters. The army has no opinion on forcing the government to implement national policies except in cases of urgent and unavoidable events. (30th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Budget for South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The unprecedented budget of 194 million yuan for the South Manchuria Railway for this year is currently being submitted to the Colonial Affairs Ministry for approval. The Colonial Affairs Ministry considers the Manchuria Railway to be the foundation of Manchuria's development, and the large budget is unavoidable. However, considering the impact on the financial world, it has decided to approve it with the following hopes: Must strictly implement austerity and reduce unnecessary expenses, must reduce the scale. In addition, the Colonial Affairs Ministry, in addition to the stock payment of 54 million yuan in the above budget, will also approve the issuance of bonds of 140 million yuan upon its submission.

<p>(Tokyo) Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai expressed his views on the future economic construction policy of Manchuria at the cabinet meeting on the 30th, and they have been approved and understood by the cabinet members. They are recorded below: (1) The future economic construction of Manchuria should focus on the coexistence and co-prosperity of Japan and Manchuria, and the development of the Manchuria Railway should be the fundamental policy. The current organization of the Manchuria Railway should be reformed. (2) The Manchuria Railway should implement fundamental production methods for Manchuria's transportation and national defense industries. (3) Related companies of the Manchuria Railway are considered to need reorganization. The Manchuria Railway is currently working hard on research. Those related companies that can be separated from the Manchuria Railway and have independence, or those that cannot be fully functional without the control of the Manchuria Railway, should be dealt with appropriately based on the above two facts after the Manchuria Railway conducts its own research and examines the results. The authorities will adhere to this policy. (4) In the future, the administrative rights of the affiliated land of the Manchuria Railway can be transferred from the Manchuria Railway to the government (Kwantung Leased Territory) for jurisdiction, which is considered appropriate. This policy is currently being researched. (30th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>

<p>US Tariff Bill Passed by the House of Representatives</p>
<h3>Grants the President the Right to Negotiate Treaties</h3>
<p>To Open Negotiations with Various Countries Based on Reciprocity</p>
<p>New Trade Treaties Valid for a Maximum of Three Years</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's request to Congress for full authority to modify tariffs and negotiate trade agreements based on reciprocity has been approved by the House of Representatives today. According to this bill, the President may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries within two years without requiring Congressional approval. The trade agreements shall be valid for a maximum of three years, and if a foreign country applies discriminatory treatment to American goods before the expiration of the three-year period, the United States may give six months' prior notice to declare the agreement null and void. The President may increase or decrease tariffs within a limit of 50 percent. Treaties between the United States and 48 countries contain most-favored-nation clauses. To prevent these clauses from being violated, any benefit granted by the President to any one country shall apply to all other countries. However, all goods not covered by the new trade agreements shall still be subject to the variable tariffs stipulated in the 1930 Tariff Act when imported into the United States. For duty-free imports, the President can only maintain the items as listed on the original list and cannot increase or decrease them. The preferential tariffs applied to Cuban goods will be maintained. (March 29th, Havas)</p>
<h3>=Three of Four Amendments Rejected=</h3>
<p>(Washington) The tariff bill proposed by the administration is the most disputed bill in the current session of the US Congress. However, it has been passed by the House of Representatives today. According to the plan outlined in the bill, the President has the power to negotiate and sign reciprocal trade treaties with foreign countries and to increase or decrease tariffs according to the agreed terms. If the United States does not sign a trade treaty with a foreign country, the President can freely stipulate the tariff rates or the structure of international trade. The only amendment to the bill limits the validity of this trade policy to three years. Another section states that the President has no power to cancel or reduce war debts, but the administration has never claimed this right. In addition, there are three other amendments, all aimed at restricting the President's power, but they were rejected. The amendments are as follows:</p>
<p>First Amendment: Proposed by Congressman Treadway, this amendment requires that the administration obtain the consent of the Federal Tariff Commission before changing tariff rates; otherwise, it will not take effect.</p>
<p>Second Amendment: Proposed by Congressman Martin, this amendment restricts the preferential treatment for Cuba, with the intention of protecting the US sugar industry. The amendment states that the administration's tariff bill gives Cuba's sugar industry preferential treatment exceeding 50 percent of the tariff principle.</p>
<p>Third Amendment: To prevent the President from changing sugar tariff rates, it has also been rejected.</p>
<p>Congress previously opposed the tariff bill, arguing that it was not in line with American national conditions and contained authoritarianism. Several Democratic Congressmen also joined the opposition. They claimed that the President's request for them to support the bill was tantamount to asking them to commit political suicide. The bill has now been sent to the Senate. (March 29th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>=Revival of Inflation Sentiment=</h3>
<p>Reaction to Overruling the President's Veto</p>
<p>(New York) Today's surge in prices on the New York Stock Exchange is due to the revival of inflation sentiment, which was caused by the Senate overruling President Roosevelt's veto of the veterans' bonus bill. This is because the bill is widely seen as having inflationary characteristics. (March 29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) After the President's veto, both the House and Senate, by a majority of more than two-thirds, passed the bill to increase the salaries of civil servants and increase the amount of veterans' pensions. As a result, the national treasury's burden for this year will increase by as much as $228,000,000. Financial circles here believe that after the passage of this bill, other measures with more profound inflationary characteristics, which have been opposed by the government, may be adopted one after another, such as the issuance of $2.2 billion in banknotes to pay for the allowances of veterans, which had been rejected by the government. The market is influenced by this psychology in financial circles, leading to a rise in the prices of various securities, especially silver and other non-ferrous metal securities, by one to three dollars. The prices of many other raw materials have also risen. For example, cotton has risen by $1.30 per bale, and forward silver has risen by 36 to 55 points. President Roosevelt has recently urged the Senate to not relax the stringent measures in the bill to regulate stock exchange operations, but the Senate has passed an amendment stipulating that the regulatory measures do not apply to national and municipal government bonds. (March 28th, Havas)</p>
<h3>=Control of Cotton Production Passed by Congress=</h3>
<p>(Washington) Congressman Bankhead previously introduced a bill in the name of the government, requesting the control of cotton production, setting this year's output at 10 million bales. If this number is exceeded, a tax of 50 percent of the value of the goods will be levied to control it. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on the 20th of this month, and the Senate also approved it today. (March 29th, Havas)</p>
<h3>=Plan to Eliminate Slums=</h3>
<p>Revitalizing the Construction Industry and Relieving Unemployment</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt previously established a committee to study a large-scale plan to build new houses, repair old houses, and demolish some slum areas within the United States. This plan requires approximately $20 billion in funding. This project will be funded by banks and private individuals, with the government only responsible for administrative expenses.

<h3>Roosevelt's Policy</h3>
<p>Neither Fascist nor Communist</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's new book will be published soon. The preface to the book was disclosed today. According to the President in the preface to his new book, if there is a revolution in the United States, the process of revolution must be very peaceful, and there will be no tragic bloodshed. He also said that since the implementation of the New Deal, there has been a so-called revolution, but this revolution has neither riots nor overturning of existing laws, nor discrimination against any group or individual. Some say that my policy is close to fascism, but my policy is also the policy of the vast majority of the American people, unlike fascism, which is limited to the military or a party's policy. We are now working to complete our revolution without deviating from the principles of freedom and fairness. Others have named my policy communism, which is also inappropriate, because my policy has no restrictions on the people, unlike communism, which specializes in trampling on the law.

<p>(Moscow) Izvestia commented on the discovery of the international spy organization in Paris, saying, "Most French conservatives are unhappy to see the increasingly solid Franco-Soviet relations.

The relationship between this so-called Soviet espionage case and these people is not only well-known to us but also understood by most French citizens.

<p>Mediation of the Chaco Dispute</p>
<h3>Another Failure for the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' investigative team sent to South America for the Chaco dispute submitted a solution to Bolivia and Paraguay on February 23 of this year. As of the beginning of this month, the two countries have responded one after another. Paraguay's reply was too strong, resulting in the failure of the investigative team's mediation efforts. The Bolivian representative recently sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, reporting that the League of Nations' investigative team has left the United States, and said that the investigative team's efforts to mediate, without avoiding hard work, are admirable. However, the reason why Bolivia cannot accept Paraguay's counter-proposal is that Paraguay demands long-term occupation of land that does not legally belong to it without arbitration, so it cannot but reject it.

<h3>New York Market Conditions</h3>
<p>(New York) Today's surge in prices on the New York Stock Exchange is due to the revival of inflation sentiment, which was caused by the Senate overruling President Roosevelt's veto of the veterans' bonus bill. This is because the bill is widely seen as having inflationary characteristics. At the beginning of the stock market opening, the market was stable, and the prices of various stocks all trended upward, with many rising to one pound sterling. The market is usually quiet before the holiday, which will be no different this time. However, after the opening, although trading was light, the rising trend still unfolded slightly. Mining stocks continued to rise, and the demand for oil stocks and chemical stocks was also more active than before. The previous gloomy atmosphere in the market has been replaced by a good atmosphere today. Several parties have expressed the view that stock prices will reach the height of July last year. The continued holding of many parties is one of the reasons for the firmness of securities, and the development of current affairs is also beneficial to securities. The cotton market opened with mixed sentiment, but purchases by banking peers and Japanese companies and short covering soon promoted the rise in cotton prices. Although small speculators sold slightly, speculation about the possibility of inflation has filled the market. However, there are not many trades due to the approaching holiday. Before long, the news that the Senate passed the Bankhead amendment and the purchases by foreigners made cotton prices stronger. However, after the price increase, New Orleans began to sell, causing prices to fall slightly. Overall, at the close, sentiment was optimistic and prices were stable.</p>
<p>The concept of inflation, which arose from the President's veto being overruled by Congress, has also made silver prices high. Overseas news is also satisfactory, and market sentiment is becoming more favorable. However, merchants are still eagerly awaiting news from Washington, and the Treasury Secretary's opinion on the Des-White silver case is especially what they want to hear. Furthermore, today's firmness of the pound is also good news for the silver market. Although trading turned sluggish in the afternoon, recent prices are still higher than before, and the market is quite stable.</p>
<p>Rubber market prices were firm due to overseas news and were later influenced by the trends in the securities and cotton markets, so the market was not tired throughout the day. Sentiment was still good at the close.</p>
<p>The wheat market was quiet today due to the approaching holiday, but it is susceptible to external news. There was optimistic sentiment at the close. (March 29th, Reuters)</p>

Occasionally, there are strong men, but they are also hungry and sick, and they are on the verge of death. Most of the houses have been burned down, and most of the cattle have been slaughtered. They live in the open air and eat tree roots and grass. I hope that you will publish this tragic truth in the newspaper for the sake of compassion, so that the wealthy people in movie theaters and dance halls can have a dose of clearing heat.

<h3>A Shift in Japan's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Japan News Agency</p>
<p>=East: Ally America, North: Reject the Soviet Union=</p>
<p>=South: Peer at Australia, West: Attend to China=</p>
<p>After Japan's successful invasion of Manchuria, its military victory can be said to have reached its peak. However, both Shidehara's cooperative diplomacy and Uchida's scorched-earth diplomacy must be said to have failed. Japan is not only isolated in the Far East but also isolated in the world. After withdrawing from the League of Nations, the bleak situation in the Pacific naturally became even bleaker. Relations between Japan and the United States deteriorated day by day, and a significant rift occurred between Britain and Japan due to the competition for the cotton textile market. Naturally, there can only be a very blatant diplomacy of mutual exploitation between Japan and the Soviet Union, and there is absolutely no possibility of sincere understanding. As for China, it is simply a matter of superficial formality, with no real friendship. The general situation in the world is that, in addition to the active brewing of economic alliances, the trend of political alignment is also very serious. So, which strong country would be willing to listen to the military commands of Japan, which is currently demonstrating its hegemonic power everywhere? Therefore, it has changed its diplomatic approach, withdrawing its scorched-earth diplomacy and hinting that its militaristic actions are not impossible to compromise. Hirota's rise to power emphasizes moral diplomacy, especially with an important enticement: the transformation from the Monroe Doctrine of the Orient to the Open Door Policy, that is, the opening of Manchuria, acknowledging openness and welcoming foreigners to invest, and providing extremely favorable conditions. American capital is especially welcome. In fact, everyone knows that Japan's heavy industry is still very young, and it lacks sufficient strength to further develop Manchuria. Moreover, it has devoted most of its strength to military and military industry, so its strength in industrial development is naturally small. Therefore, it needs the assistance of foreign capital. However, given the past situation, Japan's economic war against other countries will become more intense due to serious diplomatic opposition, and there is even less talk of the so-called investment by foreign forces under Japan's dominance.</p>
<p>After several studies by Japanese diplomatic circles, financial groups, and military cliques, steps were planned to open up foreign capital: (1) Emphasize the strengthening of its national defense, prepare to build a powerful supplementary fleet, and propose that the naval ratio of Britain, the United States, and Japan should be equal, preparing for exchange conditions with the United States. (2) First, break the diplomatic deadlock between Japan and the United States, and then find a way to deal with Britain. (3) Be sure to maintain a cautious attitude towards the Soviet Union. The most important thing is to undermine the political understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the United States is truly willing to clearly state that it will not provide political assistance to the Soviet Union, Japan can also propose considerable conditions for exchange.</p>
<p>After these principles were decided, Hiroshi Saito, a young diplomat, was appointed ambassador to the United States and made contact with the US authorities in many ways, especially people from the Democratic Party. Since Saito and Hull exchanged official letters, Japan and the United States will continue to engage in negotiations on practical matters. What specific conditions the United States will put forward are still unknown here. What Japan is preparing is to exchange for the naval ratio being equal, the United States agreeing not to set up naval ports in the Far East and not to station a large fleet, and recognizing the facts that Japan has now created. If the United States considers it unsatisfactory, then Japan can propose the opening of Manchuria as a supplement. The Japanese authorities themselves argued fiercely on this point, but later all admitted that because Japan's current political strength is sufficient to dominate the four northeastern provinces, it can use political power to restrict American economic activities. According to Japanese speculation, the United States may accept Japan's proposal. Regarding Australia, it will naturally be linked to Britain. Japan very much wants to take the opportunity to break the economic alliance of Britain and its autonomous colonies. Therefore, it is desperately wooing the royal families and indigenous representatives of small countries in Asia and Africa. If Japan is to recognize the economic alliance of the British Empire, then Britain should exchange it with the most preferential mutual benefits. Regarding the Soviet Union, Japan has recently become very aware of the sensitivity of its diplomatic means. Therefore, it first weakens the Soviet Union diplomatically and then engages in a struggle of strength. At this moment, Japan is adopting a moderate policy towards the Soviet Union. Towards China, it will temporarily not use force and will make more efforts in communication in order to reverse the previous national antipathy. It is now the same towards Inner Mongolia. In short, its main purpose is, firstly, to avoid the further deterioration of international relations, and secondly, to take advantage of this to facilitate its military. (March 25, Tokyo)</p>

<h3>Newspapers Must Not Take Holidays or Suspend Publication</h3>
<p>丨Chiang Kai-shek Orders Provincial Government to Instruct All Newspapers to Comply丨</p>
<p>Nanchang News, Chairman Chiang believes that Nanchang is an area for bandit suppression, and propaganda work is of great importance. However, newspapers take holidays and suspend publication every time there is a commemoration day or a conference. At this time of intense work, newspapers must not only not suspend publication but should also work hard on propaganda. Yesterday, he specially issued a handwritten order to the provincial government that henceforth, Nanchang newspapers must not take holidays or suspend publication at any time. After receiving the order, the provincial government has informed all newspaper offices to comply. (March 28)</p>

<p>Beiping Military Branch</p>
<h3>Reorganizing and Disbanding the Remaining Sun Dianying Troops</h3>
<p>Those with Complete Firearms will be Reorganized, the Rest will be Dismissed</p>
<p>Sun Temporarily Resides in Shanxi, Sends Representative to Beiping to Meet He Yingqin</p>
<p>Beiping News, After Sun Dianying left the army, his troops gathered in Shizuishan, Dengkou, Sanshenggong, and other places, waiting to be reorganized. The Northwest War has ended, and the current problem is the proper handling of Sun's troops. Sun's troops originally numbered forty to fifty thousand men. They suffered considerable losses in the Ningxia campaign. Now, the troops of Ding Futing, Li Chunhua, Lu Cunyi, Shi Wenhua, and others have surrendered to Ma Hongkui and been incorporated by Ningxia. The remaining troops of Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, Lu Fengnian, Sun Ziyu, and others, numbering more than twenty thousand men, have retreated to Shizuishan, Dengkou, and Sanshenggong. The authorities are very cautious about the proper handling of these troops. After detailed discussions, it was decided to start with an inventory. Tao Jun, Men Bingyue, Li Ming, Zhang Xuanze, and others have been appointed as inventory committee members and dispatched to the front to conduct the inventory. Men Bingyue is currently in Dengkou, and Zhang Xuanze also arrived in Dengkou on the 22nd from Linhe to assist Men in handling the inventory. The standards for reorganization have been decided to be limited to those with firearms, horses, and numbers that meet the regulations. The remaining troops that do not meet the regulations and exceed the quota will be given severance pay and dismissed. The remaining Sun Dianying troops in Sanshenggong are being handled by Wang Qingguo and others. It is expected to be completed within two or three days, first confiscating the weapons and conducting an inventory, and then deciding separately on those to be retained and reorganized. Soldiers who have surrendered their weapons are being transported to the rear one after another to await reorganization and disbandment. Today (the 29th), more than six thousand people, escorted by personnel sent by the Shanxi army, passed through Linhe and transferred to the rear.</p>
<p>Sun Dianying himself, accompanied by Fu Zhan Kui, went to Datong and then, at the invitation of Yan Xishan of Shanxi, went to Taiyuan. He only sent his Secretary-General Liu Zengruo, carrying letters, with Fu to Beiping to meet with He Yingqin and personnel from various related parties. Sun stated in his letter to He that he had obeyed the order to leave the army and that his troops would be reorganized by the military branch. He would not interfere with how they were handled and would choose one of Taiyuan, Suiyuan, and Beiping as a temporary residence. He had first gone to Bingzhou (Taiyuan) to make arrangements and would then come to Beiping to pay his respects. He had asked Councilor Fu Zhankui to personally convey his foolish thoughts and had sent Liu Zengruo to pay his respects and request guidance. In addition to the letter to He Yingqin, Sun also had a letter to Pang Bingxun, Hu Yukun, Ji Yiqiao, and others, roughly saying that he was grateful for their previous concern and had first gone to Bingzhou and specially sent Secretary-General Liu Zengruo to pay his respects. He also stated three things in the letter: (1) He hoped to find a way to preserve his title as a member of the military branch. (2) Now that he had left the army, he would not interfere with anything. (3) He planned to reside temporarily in Shanxi. After Fu Zhankui, Liu Zengruo, and others arrived in Beiping, Fu went to Jurentang at 8 p.m. that evening to meet with He and reported on the situation. He Yingqin was pleased. Liu first visited personnel from various related parties and decided to meet with He Yingqin with Fu Zhankui tomorrow (the 30th) and return to Bingzhou the day after to report back. Pang Bingxun and others are also scheduled to go together to meet with He Yingqin tomorrow morning to discuss Sun's personal matters and the aftermath of Sun's troops. Sun has decided to temporarily reside in Shanxi and will not go to Beiping or Tianjin for the time being. He will wait until his troops have been properly handled before coming to meet with the authorities. (March 29)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Naval School Base Case</h3>
<p>French Municipal Council Urges Speeding Up the Contract Signing</p>
<p>The Naval School Will Be Moved Out of the French Concession</p>
<p>Tianjin News, The negotiations on the French Concession of Tianjin for the site of the Naval School had been decided last year after the Naval Ministry sent personnel to Tianjin to discuss with the French Consul in Tianjin. The entire school site was thirty-nine mu, excluding the fifteen mu that had already been occupied by the French Municipal Council. The remaining twenty-four mu were to be returned to our side. At that time, a draft agreement was signed, which would be effective after being approved by our government. Recently, the French Municipal Council stated that the agreement had not been approved by our government, and the Naval School had also been in arrears with the salaries of three French professors for more than 90,000 yuan (the school owed a total of 170,000 yuan in professors' salaries, of which 80,000 yuan was owed to Chinese professors). These professors urged the French Consul in Tianjin to negotiate for the prompt payment, so the French Consul hoped that this matter could be decided as soon as possible. If the Chinese government delays in repaying the French professors, the French Consul may forcibly occupy a portion of the land and sell it to pay off the arrears. It is said that after the Naval Ministry negotiated with the French Municipal Council for the return of the land, it found that the remaining land was only twenty-four mu and was shaped into a two unequal-sided triangles. The school occupying it was already insufficient. Therefore, it formed a committee with the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Education to move the Naval School out of the French Concession and build a new school building in any of the areas east and north of the Hai River in Tianjin. Although the committee has not yet decided on the construction plan, it has internally consulted the Hebei Provincial Government to first allocate a piece of land so that the size of the land can be designed. The Hebei Provincial Government has been considering for many days and has recently decided on two areas, one being the old Zhili Inspectorate site next to the Tianjin County Government on Nanma Road in Hebei, with about thirty-two mu of land, which is now abandoned and uninhabited, and the other being the old Zhen Tai Yamen east of the Drum Tower in Chengguan, which is now uninhabited, with about forty mu of land. It will consult the committee to choose one of the two. However, Zhang Tinghan, the principal of the Naval School, went to inspect and believed that the Naval School also operates a hospital. For the convenience of citizens seeking medical treatment, it should be located in a more important location for traffic. Chengguan Drum Tower East and Nanma Road are not the center of the city, so he has privately sent a letter to the committee, stating his views and requesting the Hebei Provincial Government to re-allocate the land. Regarding the construction of the new school building, it must wait for the committee to decide on the plan. It is expected that construction can begin in June or July of this year, first building a part. If the committee decides to sell the land returned by the French Municipal Council, the price will be about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. After deducting the arrears of the French professors, the remaining money will be used to build the Naval School, which will be sufficient. The hospital currently operated by the Naval School still has outpatient clinics every day, but it is fewer than it used to be. The teaching staff's maintenance costs are more than 1,000 yuan per month. When this is insufficient, it relies on the fees of medical services. Of the fifteen mu of land occupied by the French Municipal Council, seven mu were used to build a road, three mu were used to expand the Paris Earth Laboratory, three mu were used to expand the road in the future, and two mu were forcibly occupied to compensate a French shipowner. The French shipowner incident occurred as far back as 1925. A French merchant ship was injured and docked at the Dagu Shipyard for repairs. A few days after entering the dock, a fire broke out and burned down the cabins. Afterwards, the French shipowner sued the Dagu Shipyard in the Tianjin Court, and the court ruled that the Dagu Shipyard was not responsible for any. However, the French businessman refused to accept the verdict and repeatedly negotiated without success. Last year, the French Consul in Tianjin instructed the forcible occupation of two mu of land from the Naval School, including the buildings on the land, as compensation for losses. (March 28)</p>

<p>Nanchang News, The North China generals, who have been visiting Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi in batches to listen to instructions, took the opportunity to visit the bandit areas.

<p>Eastern Route Army</p>
<h3>Advancing into Jiangxi to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>The Bandit Nests in Eastern Fujian Have Been Destroyed</p>
<p>Fuzhou News, After the anti-bandit army in northern Fujian recovered Tai Ning, they advanced towards Jian Ning. Among them, the Wang division engaged in a fierce battle with the Red bandit Luo Binghui's troops in Guangming Town Yangyuan Village, located at the junction of Tai Ning and Jian Ning. At the same time, the Fan division of the Northern Route Army, which had entered Fujian from Jiangxi, also attacked Luo's bandits from Lichuan. The bandits were surrounded and attacked on both sides, suffering many casualties. They are now collapsing and retreating one after another. The Fujian army crossed Wupailing a few days ago and is approaching Jian Ning City. Scattered bandits in various places between Jiang Le and Tai Ning, and between Tai Ning and Shao Wu, are being searched and suppressed by teams dispatched by the Sun and Zhou divisions and will soon be cleared. As for the Chen division, which is pursuing the bandits in Mingxi from Yong'an, it is still fighting in the Hufang Yanqian area.

Chiang Dingwen has already departed from Xiamen, and Wei Lihuang will go to Shanghai for medical treatment due to chest pain. The military affairs in northern Fujian are still temporarily under the charge of Tang Enbo at the request of Chairman Chiang. Tang has gone to Shunchang to supervise the battle on the front lines. As for the Fuzhou headquarters, because the troops have all arrived on the front lines and there are no important events in the rear, it has also been ordered to be abolished. All personnel, led by Director Lin Weiwen, will go to Jiangxi.</p>
<p>As for the anti-bandit military affairs in eastern Fujian, they have now been launched, especially in Lianjiang and Luoyuan counties. Li Shijia, the commander of the Mawei naval port, personally led the Marine Corps and five warships to suppress the bandits by land and sea. They have destroyed the pirate nests on Xijian and Lvta Islands, rescued many hostages, and captured several bandit leaders. They are now fiercely suppressing the Red bandits Bao Jia in Chunlu and Huangqi along the coast. (March 24)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Arrives in Hankou</h3>
<p>=Liu Discusses the End of Military Affairs Regarding Bandit Suppression=</p>
<p>=Will Return to Liu'an Immediately After Meeting Liu Zhi=</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Border Area of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, arrived in Nanchang on the 23rd after being summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang, traveling from Liu'an to Jiangxi via Anqing to meet Chiang. He stayed for four days and left Nanchang on the 27th for Xun, then boarded the Anfeng warship westward. On the afternoon of the 28th, at 4:00 PM, he arrived in Hankou. On the morning of the 29th, he met with Zhang Xueliang. Liu made a statement in Hankou, saying, "The military affairs of bandit suppression in the border area of the three provinces have generally come to an end. The main force of the Red bandits has long been eliminated, and the bandit lairs have been completely destroyed. Currently, there are only scattered small bandits lurking. In the eastern area, there is Xu Haidong's faction of about 2,000 men, and in the western area, there is Wu Huanxian's faction of about 1,000 men, totaling no more than 3,000 people. They are short of guns and ammunition, and especially lack food. With their lairs destroyed and nothing to rely on, they wander around, making it difficult to pursue and suppress them. For the sake of thorough pacification, we have decided to adopt the strategy of fortifying walls and clearing the fields, constructing a network of fortresses within the four main targets: military garrison areas, militia stations, densely populated residential areas, and transportation hubs. This is to be completed within two months. From now on, even without advancing to suppress them, we can cause the remaining bandits to die of starvation, which is what is meant by subduing the enemy without fighting. The relocation of people from the bandit areas was initially met with resistance because the people were unwilling to leave their ancestral homes and those who were unaware believed it would not help. However, after implementation, the effectiveness became apparent, and the objections subsided. The relocated people received relief and gradually settled down. In total, more than 70,000 people have been relocated from the three provinces and have been accommodated separately. However, there are still more than 7,000 households in the Lao Jun Mountain area of eastern Hubei that need to be relocated. Investigations have revealed that the bandits have been redifying the border area for a long time, and the people have been largely brainwashed by them. Comfort and sewing work, etc., are all done by their elderly, weak, women and children. If they are not moved, there will still be many hidden dangers. Therefore, the relocation policy is an urgent task for clearing the bandits and must be implemented despite opposition. Other post-war reconstruction work will continue according to the original plan. As for whether a post-war reconstruction directorate will be established in the future, I did not discuss it in Nanchang. Chairman Chiang has agreed to subsidize refugee relief. After reorganization, the political affairs of Anhui Province are gradually showing signs of improvement. I feel that many political measures need to be reformed, the most important of which is to eliminate hypocrisy. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt, the whole country must pay attention to this, not just Anhui Province. Regarding the financial situation of Anhui Province, the central government has agreed to allocate 2 million yuan annually. If the reorganization is successful, revenue and expenditure can also be balanced. I plan to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang tomorrow to report on the military and political situation and to request instructions on matters such as military deployment and command. I will stay in Hankou for five or six days, and then go to either Huangchuan or Liu'an. The transportation network in that area has been completed, and travel between Huangchuan, Liu'an, and Anqing is much more convenient than before," and so on. It was rumored that Liu Zhi, the Pacification Director of Henan, would come to Hankou at the same time as Liu Zhenhua to discuss the post-war reconstruction of the three provinces, but Liu sent a telegram to Hankou from Bian on the 28th, asking when Zhang Xueliang would be inspecting and the date of his arrival in Hankou, without mentioning his own arrival. It is estimated that he will not be able to set out for another day or two. Liu Zhenhua will stay in Hankou to meet with Liu Zhi before returning to Liu'an. He Chengjun will also go to Jiangxi after meeting with Liu. (28th)</p>

<h3>Police Squad Patrol Leader Killed by Bandits</h3>
<p>The Second Squad of the County Police Team, currently stationed in Jiangzhuang, Punan, about three miles from Jiangzhuang, discovered a pirate ship on the evening of the 28th at Jinjia Bridge. Patrol Leader Zhang Zhipeng of the Second Squad received the news and reported it to Squad Leader Wang Tingwu, who immediately led Patrol Leader Zhang and three other officers to investigate. In the dim moonlight, they saw shadowy figures. Squad Leader Wang knew they were not good people and shouted a question, but the bandits opened fire first. Patrol Leader Zhang was shot in the head and fell to the ground, dying instantly. The bandits, relying on their numbers, seemed to be encircling them. Squad Leader Wang fought and retreated, returning to the squad headquarters. He gathered his men and went back to encircle them, engaging the bandits in a fierce battle for about twenty minutes. The bandits finally retreated, but it was too dark to pursue them. Today, he came to Songjiang to report the situation to the team headquarters for verification and to notify the relatives of the deceased to come to Songjiang to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Villager with Deafness Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Weng A'guan, a villager of Xinzhuang, over fifty years old, whose wife had only died five days ago, went to town to shop one evening. While walking along the railway in the wind and rain, a Hangzhou train sped past him. Weng, who was deaf, was knocked to the ground and suffered a brain injury, bleeding profusely. The driver stopped the train and notified the station police at Xinzhuang Station, who in turn informed the deceased's family. Soon, his eighty-year-old mother arrived at the scene, grieving loudly over the body. She said that Weng A'guan still had a son and a daughter, and the family was in a very difficult situation. It is said that the Railway Bureau has agreed to provide a pension of twenty yuan. The body was claimed by his elderly mother, who requested that an autopsy be waived, and was taken home for burial.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Li Shuyun Critically Ill in Detention Center</h3>
<p>The case of Liu Zhuomin, involving Li Shuyun, the wife of the Director of Civil Affairs, Gu Renfa, and her mother, Ms. Liu, their arrest and escort to Wuxi for interrogation, have been reported in this newspaper several times. However, Director Gu claimed that Li Shuyun was also involved in selling official positions and fraud. A few days ago, the Department of Civil Affairs submitted eight pieces of evidence to the provincial government for transfer to the county court for verification. It is now learned that the evidence consists only of one-sided statements and cannot be relied upon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Contents of the Evidence</h3>
<p>The contents of the eight pieces of evidence are confidential, making it difficult to obtain the truth. After much effort, our reporter learned from provincial sources yesterday that the evidence largely consists of accusations from third parties and contains only one-sided statements that cannot be relied upon. Therefore, the prosecutor's office believes that the evidence is insufficient. However, there are two receipts written by Shuyun, which were reported by Huang, the captain of the Junhe ship under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Water Police First District. One receipt was written on stationery, stating, "Received today one hundred yuan in silver dollars sent by Mr. Wang from Dalian. This is the receipt." The other was written on a business card, stating, "Received one hundred yuan in silver dollars from Dalian." These amounts were sent to Director Gu's residence in Zhenjiang by Captain Huang in two installments a month ago, and Shuyun issued receipts for them. However, the captain's surname is Huang, but the receipt says Wang. Is this a clerical error, or did Shuyun receive the money on behalf of the director without knowing the captain's surname? This point is worth investigating. Also, the wording of the two receipts, one saying "sent from Dalian" and the other saying "received silver dollars from Dalian," is also worth investigating. If this money was indeed an illegal bribe received by Shuyun in the name of the director, then Captain Huang's crime of bribery should be punished in the same way as the crime of receiving a bribe, and he will not be able to escape the law.</p>
<h3>Shuyun Critically Ill</h3>
<p>Li Shuyun has been suffering from excessive stress. After coughing up blood several times in prison, her health is deteriorating. According to Dr. Zhang Zimei, Shuyun's condition is critical. Because she was congenitally weak, she had developed a delicate constitution from living a comfortable life. Now, in prison, the air is foul, the food is poor, and she is deeply stressed, unable to eat and crying all day. Therefore, she is likely to collapse. If she remains in prison for another half month, her health will be severely affected, and her life may be in danger. A few days ago, Shuyun's younger brother, Huaisheng (18 years old, studying at Nanjing May 30th Middle School), came to Wuxi alone to visit his mother and sister in prison. They met and cried bitterly, talked briefly, and then hurriedly left to take a train to Nanjing. Shuyun is going to make a statement in response to Gu Renfa's advertisement in the newspapers and will personally write a letter of appeal to the people of the country from prison, revealing the details of her engagement and marriage to Gu, the discovery of his bigamy, and her arrest. After having the original draft revised by a lawyer, it will be published in major newspapers across the country.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Li's Arrest</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Legislator Huang Yiou also made a statement to visiting reporters, saying that Xu Pucheng and Liu Anxi came to his residence to search for and arrest Li Shuyun, claiming that she was suspected of communist activities. However, the official document from the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering Xu Pucheng to escort Shuyun, stated that the French Concession police had captured her, so police were dispatched to escort her. These statements are contradictory, and there must be other motives. Huang also said that all parties in Nanjing believe that Gu Renfa is being too absurd, involving the overall situation for his personal affairs, which is deeply distressing. The Control Yuan has proposed impeaching Gu for tarnishing official integrity. Because the case has been handed over to the judiciary, which is sacred and should be handled impartially, no immediate action will be taken, and they will wait for the Wuxi court to make a decision. Huang continued, saying that even if Shuyun had instigated Liu Zhuomin to resist taxes and engaged in fraud and bribery, why should her elderly mother be implicated? To tell the truth about this case, Li Shuyun's arrest was not solely due to fraud and bribery; there were other purposes. Therefore, when the Wuxi County Court opened the trial the other day, Shuyun requested bail due to her serious illness. The official said that she might not be as safe outside as she was inside the detention center. Li agreed that his words were very reasonable, so she was returned to custody. This shows that the court is well aware of the truth of this case.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Gu's Bigamy</h3>
<p>Li Shuyun's defense statement has been drafted by lawyer Chao Kun and is currently being revised by lawyer Zhang Shizhao. The charge of Gu's bigamy is also attached to the defense statement and will not be submitted for now. It will be submitted when Director Gu appears in court. According to lawyer Chao, Director Gu said in a newspaper interview that "If I, as an administrative official, must confront every criminal I report, then administrative officials will be overwhelmed." However, it should be known that an administrative official does not necessarily have to appear in court to report a subordinate. Director Gu is reporting his wife in his capacity as a husband, which is not comparable to an ordinary official reporting a subordinate. He should have an obligation to appear in court for cross-examination. As for Gu's first wife, Ai Chengmei, accusing Gu of bigamy in the Jiangning District Court, the newspaper reports are inconsistent. It is now learned that Ms. Ai has hired a lawyer to sue Gu for bigamy and abandonment in the Jiangning District Court because Director Gu has publicly declared that he has divorced her, which is clearly an intention to abandon her, and his cruel methods against Li Shuyun are more poisonous than snakes and vipers and more ruthless than jackals and wolves, which is enough to make any weak woman feel insecure. The Jiangning District Court is proceeding according to law. It is also learned that Li Shuyun's condition improved slightly yesterday (30th). Her doctor's diagnosis states: "Her pulse is now slightly calmer, she is taking a small amount of rice soup, her spirit is better, her bowels have moved, but not much. Last night, she vomited up purple clots again. Her temperature has dropped to 99 degrees, her tongue coating is less, and there is less phlegm. Her lower abdomen is distended, and she will be treated from the liver and stomach."</p>
<h3>Marshal Sun Arrested for Kidnapping and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>Zang Bingsheng, a villager from Zangjia Alley, near Gangxia, 494th Tu, Seventh District of the county, was strangled to death in the first month of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). The Tu Zheng (local head) reported the case to the county court, and Prosecutor Zhu Qian went to the village for an autopsy, confirming that he had been strangled. However, the murderer has not been caught, and the case has remained unsolved for three years. In the second month of this year, the prosecutor's office of the county court issued a summons to the deceased's mother, Sun, to appear in court for questioning. After receiving the summons, Sun complied and came to the city with her son, Baosheng, to await questioning. However, Sun Er (nicknamed Marshal Sun, also known as Sun Xujin), a notorious local rogue, learned of this. Sun Er had a long-standing feud with Zhang and others in the area and saw this as an opportunity. He tricked Sun and Baosheng into his home and insisted that Sun falsely accuse Zhang of being the murderer who strangled Bingsheng when she appeared in court. However, Sun did not mention Zhang when she appeared in court. Sun Er found out and abducted Sun and Baosheng. Later, Baosheng took the opportunity to escape and reported the incident to the county court. Meanwhile, Baosheng's wife, in the city, seized Sun Er and turned him over to the county public security bureau. Sun Er confessed that Sun was hidden in a shrine shop on Shuyuan Lane Main Street in the city and other details. After receiving the confession, Director Li of the Public Security Bureau ordered detectives to go there. They found Sun hidden in a secret room, and the guard had already fled. Sun was rescued and taken to the bureau to await investigation. However, Sun Er gathered a crowd to organize a thousand-person association during the Xinhai Revolution, started an uprising in the northern countryside, set fire to Wangzhuang, called himself a governor, and claimed to be a grand marshal, causing disturbances in the countryside. The Wuxi military government sent troops to the countryside to suppress him, and the group was dispersed. More than twenty of his followers were captured. Sun Er escaped and was wanted by the military government but was never caught. This was reported in newspapers in Shanghai and recorded in the military section of the Wuxi Restoration History. Afterward, he still did not settle down and associated with bandits, committing numerous crimes. This arrest is the culmination of his evil deeds. Yesterday (30th), at 1:00 PM, Director Li prepared a document and transferred Sun Er, Baosheng's mother, Zang Sun, and his wife, Zhou, to the county court for trial.</p>

<h3>Robbery of Bride Leads to Fatal Incident</h3>
<p>Sha Qihong, a farmer in Pujixiang, Sixth District, was betrothed to the daughter of Chen Laoer from the Beichang Shuiqiao area through an introduction by Wei Jinmao two years ago. Sha Qihong has been unable to marry her due to poor harvests in recent years. He colluded with Wei Jinmao and led a group of people to Chen's house at the beginning of this month to rob the bride and complete the marriage. The next day, Chen Laoer questioned Wei Jinmao, which led to a verbal argument and then a fight. Wei was no match for Chen and was injured. He died on the 26th due to his injuries after failing to respond to treatment. The deceased's family reported the incident to the county for an autopsy. Yesterday, Assessor Deng went to the scene for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed two fractures in the deceased's left rib and one bruise on his right shoulder blade, confirming that he died from his injuries. The suspect, Chen Laoer, has been arrested by the Sixth District Regiment Headquarters and sent to the county for investigation.</p>

<h3>Sanyu Establishes Airfield</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate air force flights in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Aviation Administration has established a large-scale airfield in Nantong. Zhao Zhongyi was dispatched to survey and select a site. It was decided to build the airfield near the East Town of Sanyu.</p>
<h3>Change of Land Tax Director</h3>
<p>Gou Zengji, the Director of Land Tax in Nantong, embezzled more than 20,000 yuan of public funds and was dismissed and ordered to repay the funds by the county government. On the 29th, County Magistrate Cheng convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies to discuss the selection of a replacement. It was decided that Lu Zhoushan would take over the position.</p>

<h3>Gale Sinks Tinfoil Boat</h3>
<p>The Antai Guotangxing (a type of business) in Xixing was transporting tinfoil from Shaoxing to Tantou Village when it was investigated and detained by the tinfoil inspection office there, causing the cargo ship to depart late. Yesterday, when it reached the Nianyu Mouth area of the Qiantang River, it was suddenly hit by a gale and sank, resulting in losses of over 25,000 yuan. The company is now negotiating with the tinfoil inspection office, and the two sides have even clashed. They have each filed a lawsuit with the court. It is unknown how this compensation lawsuit will be resolved.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Impartial Discussion of the Draft Constitution (3)) Continued (·Zhang·Yuan·Ruo</h3>
<p>(8) Local System</p>
<p>A. Province | The provincial system is a very complex issue. In recent years, there has been much discussion about its reform. Some advocate reducing the size of provinces, while others advocate abolishing provinces and merging counties. However, it is questionable whether such bold legislation is permissible under the current political situation. Furthermore, without making the necessary preparations and concrete plans in advance, it should be carefully considered whether such bold legislation can be implemented effectively and without drawbacks. In my humble book, "Modern Constitutionalism," in the chapter on the local system, I have considered the situation and advocated reducing provincial power and vigorously promoting county governance. I will not elaborate further here. I will only make a brief comment on the articles of the draft constitution.</p>
<p>Article 130 states that the province is an administrative region directly under the central government. The word "directly" is actually problematic. It is inferred that the drafters intended this because the province is not a local area, so they had to make this unique provision. In our view, since our country has been a large unified country for thousands of years, such a unique system and organization is unnecessary for the national situation. At a time when local autonomy is being promoted and peaceful unification is being attempted, such an unfavorable and unique name should not be retained in the constitution, so as to avoid generating unfavorable consciousness in the minds of the people. Following this logic, the chapter on provinces should be included in the local system and the province should be defined as a higher-level local autonomous region. Furthermore, Chapter 6, "Division of Powers between the Central and Local Governments," only has the dichotomy of central and local, without the meaning of "province" intervening in it.</p>
<p>Article 133 has many defects. First, if the provincial council can elect the governor, why does it not have the power to remove him? Second, regarding the proposal of laws concerning the province to the Legislative Yuan, must all provincial legislation be referred to the central government for instructions? If so, how can the central government actually understand the actual situation and needs of each province? If not, then Article 62 of the draft constitution only allows local governments to enact separate regulations, but there is no provision for provinces. Third, since the provincial council has great power to control provincial affairs, how should the relationship be handled if the provincial council conflicts with the governor? How should it be remedied if the provincial council acts arbitrarily? There are no provisions for this, which is very dangerous. Article 135, which stipulates that soldiers cannot be candidates for governor until three years after leaving the military, is in line with my humble opinion (Note 17). However, Article 134 does not specify to whom the governor should be responsible, the central government or the provincial people. How should the governor be sanctioned if he acts arbitrarily? Furthermore, the fact that the governor is not appointed by the central government contradicts the legislative spirit of Article 130. In fact, the central government will therefore be unable to directly command. If no effective remedy is devised, will Article 136, which states that the governor is subject to the command of the central government, not become a pipe dream?</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the province supervises local autonomy, but the relationship between the province and the county is not specified, how will it exercise its supervisory power? Difficulties will inevitably arise in the future. Furthermore, looking at the provisions of Article 136, the powers of the province are empty and without substance. I have already discussed this in the previous section on the division of powers between the central and local governments.</p>
<p>B. County | The county, as a unit of autonomy, is the foundation for promoting democracy, completing constitutional governance, and developing the people's livelihood. When the National Assembly formulated the Provisional Constitution a few years ago, I wrote an article titled "The True Interpretation of the Provisional Constitution" and published it in this newspaper, emphasizing this point. Article 140 of the current draft constitution stipulates the matters of county autonomy in great detail, which is in line with my humble opinion. However, how will these complex and burdensome matters be implemented? First of all, it depends on having sufficient financial resources. In the past, the income of various counties was largely squeezed out by the province. The income from various miscellaneous taxes in the counties was all seized by the provincial treasury (Note 18). Therefore, how to prevent the province from squeezing out the counties and ensure the financial resources of the counties is most closely related to the reform and promotion of county administration in the future. Those responsible for drafting the constitution should also pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(9) Concluding Remarks</p>
<p>1. Regarding the guarantee of the Constitution | Modern constitutions have independent organs to guarantee the constitution (detailed in my book "Modern Constitutionalism"). The draft constitution lacks this. Although Article 156 stipulates that laws that conflict with this constitution are invalid, how can they be made invalid? Empty words are not enough.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the amendment of the Constitution | The amendment of the constitution should not be too difficult or too easy. The disadvantage of the former is that it cannot meet the needs of the times and easily leads to revolution. The disadvantage of the latter is that it cannot stabilize the order of the country and increase the people's confidence in the constitution. In our opinion, the amendment of the constitution should be divided into two parts. One part should be able to be amended at any time, and the other part should be the basic principles that should be followed as the foundation of the country and the ultimate principles that are believed by the whole country, which cannot be easily amended.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the promulgation of the Constitution | Article 160 stipulates that this constitution shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. Our country is currently under political tutelage, which has not yet been completed, and the people's rights are very immature. Promulgating the constitution rashly is like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, which is dangerous. This is the basic issue of constitutionalism in our country today. On this point, I have pondered deeply and have some feelings. I will express my humble opinion on another day.</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday from Nanjing</h3>
<p>Seventeen Groups Host Public Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>Yan Recounts His Feelings at the Banquet</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Huiqing, the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, went to Tianjin after returning to the country and then met with Wang to report. After also meeting with Chiang in Jiangxi, he has now finished matters and come east. He arrived in Shanghai by the Beijing-Shanghai night express train at 7:30 yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he went to the countryside to sweep the tombs. At 6:00 in the evening, seventeen groups, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, Bankers Association, Money Industry Association, General Labor Union, Institute for International Studies, and International Trade Association, hosted a public banquet at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Yan will go on a cruise in the coming days and visit relatives. The details of Yan's speech and the banquet held by various groups are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Yan Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>At 7:30 yesterday morning, Ambassador Yan, accompanied by his brother Deqing and others, arrived at the North Station on the Beijing-Shanghai night express train. Yan was greeted at the station by Dr. Fu Qing, the President of Shanghai Medical College, and Dr. Wang Peiyuan, the Chairman of the Red Cross Society. After getting off the train, Yan went to the New Asia Hotel to rest and receive visitors.</p>
<p>Sweeping the Tombs in the Countryside In the afternoon, Ambassador Yan, along with his three brothers, Deqing and Fuqing, went to the countryside to sweep the ancestral tombs. Yan has been abroad for many years, negotiating diplomatically. He has returned home on leave at the time of the Qingming Festival. He took this opportunity to visit and sweep the tombs before returning in the evening.</p>
<h3>Remarks by Envoy Yan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Envoy Yan told reporters that when he passed through Beijing, he met with Wang, the concurrent Minister of Foreign Affairs, and discussed various issues related to diplomacy with the Soviet Union. In the future, all issues regarding the Sino-Soviet trade agreement will be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Soviet Ambassador to China, as all the archives are in Beiping. Due to the interruption of Sino-Russian relations before and after the Russian Revolution, and after the resumption of diplomatic relations, our envoys to the Soviet Union have not yet taken office (note that the first ambassador was Sun Baoqi, who never went abroad). All negotiations have been handled by the Soviet Ambassador Karakhan in China. Diplomatic relations were again interrupted in 1927, so the embassy in Moscow has no files to consult, which makes negotiations in Moscow quite difficult. The rumor that I will be negotiating in Russia is absolutely false. As for the situation in North China, based on what I saw during my trip to Peiping and Tianjin to handle personal affairs, I deeply feel the danger of the situation in North China. What is even more dangerous is that the people of the country, instead of thinking about actively saving the situation, simply lament the complexity and urgency of the North China problem, and then indifferently leave it to fate. The danger of this kind of thinking is unspeakable. It is like a person who is seriously ill, whose family members, even if they know that the patient is terminally ill, will definitely try every means to seek medical treatment and buy medicine as long as there is still a breath of life left. They would never abandon the patient and let him die because of his critical condition. I sincerely hope that the whole country will be united and invigorated, and not have this kind of self-defeating mentality. During my trip to and from North China and the major ports along the Yangtze River, what saddened me the most was the pervasive atmosphere of drugs, and the anti-smoking laws were like empty words. The bad habits of the people in their daily lives regarding drugs, and the so-called demeanor of celebrities and intellectuals who lead society and do not care about trivial matters, are still prevalent. If they do not care about trivial matters in their daily lives and take arbitrary measures, they will also be spiritually scattered when dealing with major events. Having lived abroad for a long time, I deeply feel that Europeans and Americans are much more spirited than the Chinese. The Chinese are easily pleased by small victories and easily discouraged by small defeats. I deeply hope that we can change this bad habit and revitalize the declining customs. When I passed through Nanchang, I happened to encounter the New Life Movement lantern parade, which was very lively. I sincerely hope that the whole country can earnestly change the decadent customs and revitalize the spirit. During my trip to Nanchang, I paid a visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and reported on my missions to the United States, Switzerland, and Russia. I stayed in Nanchang for four or five days and visited Chiang twice. Chiang did not express any opinions on diplomatic issues and is now focusing all his efforts on suppressing the communists.</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech:</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, saying, "After the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference in 1922, our representative, Minister Gu Shaochuan, returned to the country after the event, passing through Shanghai. Various organizations in Shanghai held a welcome ceremony in the auditorium of the former General Chamber of Commerce, listening to his report on the struggles during the conference. Twelve years have passed, and today our associations are welcoming Ambassador Yan Junren, who has worked hard in Geneva, at this same location. The situation has changed greatly, just as the people of the Eastern Jin Dynasty said, 'The scenery is the same, but the eyes see a different country.' Looking back on the past, I am filled with mixed feelings. Therefore, today, in this grand gathering, we deeply express our condolences to Ambassador Yan, and when we think of the changing situation in the Far East and the increasing tension, we cannot help but share tears together. This is not a pessimistic or decadent statement, but because in today's situation, we have lost four provinces, lost 30 million people, and the invading tide of those who seek to harm us continues to advance. China's future today is truly like the poet's saying, 'Like a boat drifting, not knowing where it will reach.' No optimist can fail to admit that the dark clouds of misery will soon spread and envelop the land. Therefore, today we must not only express our condolences, but also encourage and warn each other. This should be agreed upon by Ambassador Yan and all those present. As for Ambassador Yan's experience in Geneva, the results of his struggle cannot be called a failure. Even if some people point to the failure to recover the four provinces as a diplomatic failure of our country, they do not know that since Japan occupied the Northeast, our country has entrusted the entire case to the League of Nations for handling. Therefore, at this time, our country no longer has diplomacy with Japan, but only diplomacy with the League of Nations. In other words, our country's diplomacy with Japan has become the joint diplomacy of the League of Nations with Japan. Therefore, whether this case fails or not should be discussed from two aspects. What our country requires of the League of Nations is not to recognize Japan's occupation of the four provinces by force and to demand that Japan return the four provinces to our country. This request has not only been recognized by the League of Nations and made into a report, but also the powers that have not joined the League of Nations have also agreed to this approach and have repeatedly issued declarations to the world. Therefore, our country's request has been supported by the whole world. From this point of view, it cannot be said that it has not been implemented. As for the joint diplomacy of the League of Nations with Japan, it must be said to be a failure. But there is no lack of talented diplomats in various countries. Why can't they make Japan submit like the Three Kingdoms' intervention in the return of Liaodong? Even if Japan's national strength is not comparable to that of the Sino-Japanese War, why can't they make Japan make considerable concessions like Ambassador Yan Huiqing's time at the Washington Conference? This is because after the European War, the damage to national strength was too great, and the internal contradictions and disputes in Europe became more and more serious, which prevented them from exerting their full strength to deal with the Far East crisis. Therefore, the failure of the League of Nations' joint response to Japan is not a failure in diplomacy, but a failure in the political situation created in the past ten years. Therefore, in the diplomacy used by Ambassador Yan in Geneva, we should not discuss the signs of success or failure, but only discuss whether he has done his best. With Japan ranked among the three major powers in the League of Nations, wielding considerable influence, countries, although respecting public reason, did not dare to overly offend its intentions. Matsuoka Yosuke, full of domineering talent, was especially praised by his country, which eventually led to the loss of sympathy from the world and had to return defeated. This is Ambassador Yan's greatest effort in Geneva. In the midst of the broken mountains and rivers, we express our condolences with tears. The main purpose is here. While we express our condolences for the past, we must also encourage him for the future. I dare to offer my humble opinion to Ambassador Yan, that the current government authorities have repeatedly told us that only by striving to improve domestic affairs can we talk about diplomacy. The meaning is that China has no way to strive in the diplomatic field at present, and can only temporarily put it aside and first exert all its strength to improve domestic affairs. But at the same time, it is also said that the strengthening of national power cannot be achieved overnight, and foreign troubles can destroy us immediately. These two statements come from the government's expression, but the meaning is inevitably different. If it is like the latter statement, China still cannot fail to pursue diplomacy, because the so-called improving domestic affairs and strengthening national power should at least be like the Soviet Union's so-called five-year plan, after a considerable period of time, there will be strength to show. But in this sound of foreign troubles that can destroy us immediately, we cannot fail to use strategies in diplomacy to seek self-preservation, and then we can have the opportunity to calmly improve domestic affairs. The Soviet Union, after waiting for the completion of the five-year plan, made the European countries look at it with new eyes, and then took the opportunity to conclude multilateral non-aggression treaties to enhance its international position. This is in line with the authorities' idea of prioritizing domestic affairs and then attending to diplomacy, but at the same time, judging from the example of Turkey, when Greece advanced into Asia Minor, it did not unite with Soviet Russia, France, and Italy as allies to alleviate the oppression of Greece, otherwise Turkey might have been reduced to a colony. Even if there was Kemal, there would be no way to develop his achievements. This is a precedent for domestic affairs and diplomacy to be equally important. China's situation today is very different from that of the Soviet Union, but similar to that of Turkey. It is like a person suffering from illness, the speed of the bacteria's invasion far exceeds the effectiveness of the daily nutrition gained. It is impossible to rely on this to increase physical strength and resist bacteria. The only way is to first inject medicine to stop the bacteria's reproduction and progress, and then we can calmly recuperate. The principle of governing a country and treating a disease is the same. Ambassador Yan is a senior figure in the diplomatic world. After settling his personal affairs, he will still be stationed in Europe, fulfilling his mission of negotiation. Therefore, what we hope for Ambassador Yan is not to let the instability of the European situation, nor the intertwining of domestic and foreign troubles in our country, slightly dampen his ambition of high-handedness. In the past ten years, we have admired empty theories in diplomacy and have not paid attention to the actual situation, so that when the Shenyang Incident occurred, we were almost at a loss. The loss of the four provinces can be said to be the result of diplomatic short-sightedness in the past ten years. If we continue to deal with this kind of rough attitude in the future, what will be lost is not the four provinces, but the entire nation. It can be asserted that the responsibility of the diplomatic world lies in observing the trend of international situation in the next few decades and making plans in advance. Secondly, we should also pay attention to the complexity of the international situation and how it affects our own interests, and make plans for elimination and remedy. If we respond to events after they happen, we will inevitably be caught off guard. I have read Wang Yunsheng's record of Ambassador Wang's return to China from Japan. Although it is only a glimpse, the content has not been fully disclosed, and I cannot help but sigh deeply. There is a sense of "bending the chimney and moving the firewood" of the ancients. Considering Ambassador Yan's handling of the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia, which was meticulous and swift, we know that he must have a deep understanding of the international situation. In Beijing and Nanchang, there must be good plans to offer to the authorities. We only hope that they can be adopted immediately and become the national policy. We especially hope that they can be entrusted to Ambassador Yan with full authority for flexible handling, so that foreign troubles can be slightly relieved and there can be an opportunity for calm self-improvement. This is the only wish of the whole country. Today, our associations are doing this to exchange sincere intentions and discuss ways to save the country, not to follow the usual story of social interaction. Therefore, the words of encouragement and expectation are more than the words of praise and commendation. We only hope that Ambassador Yan can appreciate our sincerity and criticize us greatly, and offer a toast to wish Ambassador Yan to continue to strive for the entire nation in the future."</p>
<p>Envoy Yan's Reply:</p>
<p>Ambassador Yan Junren stood up and replied, "Today, I am very grateful for the warm hospitality of everyone and for listening to the grand remarks of Chairman Wang Xiaolai. I really feel ashamed and grateful. In fact, I am just an ordinary diplomat, doing my duty, and I have not made any great contributions. As for attending the League of Nations in Geneva, it was just a coincidence. When I went to the United States the year before last, it was only a temporary assignment. I had only been in the United States for more than twenty days when I received a telegram from the government urging me to go to Geneva to attend the League of Nations. At first, we cited Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, the meaning of which was entirely for reconciliation. If a conflict occurred between two countries, it could be mediated on this basis. The method also required the consent of the two parties concerned before it could take effect, so there were no very strict measures at the time. Therefore, our delegation decided to change to Article 15. However, according to this article, it still had to be resolved by the Executive Yuan. The difference from Article 11 was that it could be transferred to the General Assembly for discussion. Therefore, the public banquet for Ambassador Yan by 17 organizations such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (photographed by Qichang Photo Studio)</p>
<p>We immediately decided to propose that the base be submitted to the General Assembly. Although it was opposed by other countries, we still fought for it. In the end, with the help of the small countries in the General Assembly, the report of the General Assembly could be favorable to us. The report was based on the Lytton Report as a source of information. It was an affirmative statement. The Northeast Incident was very important to our country, but the European countries did not pay much attention to it. When the Shanghai War occurred, they changed their attitude because of the close relationship and no longer opposed the citation of Article 15. Today is the banquet for the Shanghai organizations, so I will say a few more words about the Shanghai Incident. The occurrence of the Shanghai Incident had a great impact on various countries, and at that time, the Disarmament Conference, which had been preparing for nearly ten years, was about to open. However, on the East Asian continent, there was a rumble of artillery fire, which made them feel extremely contradictory and funny. I have some dissatisfaction with the League of Nations because it has no effective measures. Although the Shanghai War can be based on the resolution of the League of Nations and resolved with the guarantee of the four major powers, our losses and compensation are nil. This is really unsatisfactory to the League of Nations. However, the Battle of Shanghai greatly increased our country's status and value. At first, we felt disheartened in Geneva. When the Shanghai Resistance War broke out, we were extremely excited. At that time, newspapers in various countries praised us, because this battle was not only a military resistance, but also the enthusiastic support of the people in all aspects, which made foreigners recognize the national spirit of our country. In Geneva, a representative also spoke to me as follows: In the past, all the powers thought that 20,000 people could conquer the whole of China, but from then on, no less than 100,000 troops dared to go to Shanghai. But at present, which country can immediately send this heavy force to launch an invasion? When I came to Shanghai, I met a Western banker who told me that he had never seen the Chinese people so enthusiastic as this time. Not only did the gentlemen work hard to participate in the work, but also the ladies rushed to donate, solicit donations, and rescue. Therefore, I am deeply grateful to the people of Shanghai. Later, when the Rehe Incident occurred, there was this kind of sarcastic tone internationally. In the past, the reason why China did not fight was that it could entrust the League of Nations. Now that it has obtained the judgment of the League of Nations, how can it be that a giant country of 400 million people is attacked by a dwarf country of 700,000 people without making any effort to defend itself? What will happen to Rehe now? This is really what our representatives abroad cannot argue with. The Shanghai Incident was handled better in the League of Nations because it received international attention. Because the Shanghai Incident was handled better, the East Incident can also be cited in the same way, so it is also affected to a considerable extent. At tonight's banquet, I can mention a few feelings: (1) In this Sino-Japanese dispute, world opinion has unanimously expressed sympathy for us. Although it does not help the facts, it is still very exciting in spirit. (2) International help is limited. If we really want to get practical help from the League of Nations, we must first seek self-help, because the League of Nations is not a supreme authority. Its greatest role is only reconciliation. If reconciliation is hopeless, it is really difficult to have other methods in practice. (3) Some say, why do the Chinese and Japanese fight lawsuits in front of Westerners? When I was handling diplomacy in Beiping, I also had a feeling of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Chinese culture is earlier than Japanese culture. In the past, it held the position of elder brother. But now, with the Europeanization, Japan has far surpassed our country. China is an agricultural country, and Japan is a manufacturing country. There is the possibility of cooperation, but Japan is using force to forcibly oppress us, so we will never be willing to be inferior to it. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese will be able to realize and cooperate to avoid fighting lawsuits in front of white people and leaving a joke for other races. In the next year or two, the country's affairs will still be in trouble, but there is no need to be overly pessimistic. Like a patient, even in the most dangerous situation, he should try his best to find a way to escape death, and he must never sit still and wait for death. The Northeast is like an arm. Losing an arm is very painful. Shanghai is the heart, which is especially important. Therefore, I hope that you will rise up and work together to plan ways to save the country. I have observed several provinces during my return trip and seen that there has been considerable progress in all aspects of the country, so I am not disappointed in the future of the country. However, Shanghai is the center of transportation, public opinion, and finance, and you are all leaders in various fields, so I hope that you will continue to work hard to achieve a bright future."</p>
<p>Qin Runqing Elected</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Citizen Group Representative</h3>
<p>The newspaper reported on the 29th that the list of 27 elected representatives of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Shanghai Concession included Mr. Pan Jiyan. After the association checked, Mr. Pan's vote was a recording error. Because Mr. Pan's annual housing tax payment at his residence on Seymour Road was 200 yuan, which was less than the association's eligibility regulations for the elected, which required an annual housing tax payment of 168 taels (that is, more than 235 yuan), Mr. Qin Runqing, who received 227 votes, was promoted to the citizen group representative yesterday.</p>
<p>Nee Rong Association</p>
<h3>Deadline for Cleaning up Japanese Nee Rong Goods</h3>
<p>=Complete Clean Up by April 15th=</p>
<p>=And Thoroughly Investigate the Western Merchant Import Association=</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reported, the lost land in the Northeast has not been recovered, and the wounds of the January 28th Incident are still there. Anyone with a little blood should lie down and taste the gall, and strive to revive themselves to save the country's difficulties. However, in recent times, a group of treacherous merchants who are blinded by profit have disregarded everything, importing large quantities of enemy nee rong goods, changing their appearance, and selling them on the market. In order to prevent the enemy goods, the local nee rong industry association has made special inquiries from various parties. The sales of these nee rong and foreign goods are undertaken by Sen Ji Company, and Mr. Chen of a certain remittance bank on Ningbo Road is providing economic assistance. The association has sent separate letters to various colleagues refusing to purchase, and limited them to clean up completely by April 15th. On the one hand, they have also thoroughly investigated the Western Merchant Import Association. The original letter is copied as follows.</p>
<h3>Letter to Nee Rong Colleagues to Clean up next Month</h3>
<p>Letter from the Nee Rong Industry Association to various Nee Rong Merchants: We are writing to inform you that the Japanese have seized our East Province and displayed their troops in Shanghai, killing thousands of people and causing billions of dollars in losses. At this time of great pain, we are determined to permanently sever economic ties in order to save the country's fortune. Until now, the lost land has been sinking, and the alliance has been humiliating. Anyone with a little blood should taste the gall and lie down, and make persistent efforts. No matter how sweet the words and temptations are, they should not be moved. Moreover, paying the tariff is helping the enemy, and even foolish children cannot bear this. However, looking back at the recent active situation of Japanese merchants and the influx of Japanese goods into the market, only our nee rong industry has purchased large quantities, and they actually regard it as a gold mine. How can we bear to sigh? These are all unfaithful treacherous merchants, acting as accomplices for the tigers. All national thoughts and national concepts have disappeared. It can be said that Uncle Bao has no heart. Our association follows the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter and must rectify. Once the sale of enemy goods is found to be based, severe penalties will be given. Commercial companies that have not joined the industry association can also be handled by the industry's general association with the qualification of leaders. In addition to the association's resolution, the corresponding letter is sent for your information and compliance without any shortcomings. If there are enemy goods, clean them up completely by April 15th, and do not sell them again in the future. If you continue to violate this intentionally, it will be self-abandonment. The association will handle it in accordance with the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce without any concealment. Please pay attention.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Western Merchant Association, Pay Attention to Changing Brands</h3>
<p>Another letter to the Shanghai Western Merchant Import Association: We are writing to inform you that the nee rong that our industry operates has always been mainly imported from Europe and the West by members of your association, which has a long history. However, recently, European and American nee rong have suddenly declined. It is said that the market situation is sluggish. It is important to know that the main reason is the competition from Japanese nee rong. Our industry does not want to use Japanese goods for fellow merchants. Since there is little transaction, how can there be such a wide outlet, and can it seize the seats of imported nee rong affiliated to your association? It is learned that there are imported foreign companies affiliated to your company that purchase Japanese goods, change their appearance, and sell them in between, or use Japanese goods to change to their own foreign company's signs and sell them to fellow merchants. Therefore, Japanese goods are becoming more and more popular, and European and Western nee rong are becoming more and more stagnant. In this situation, not only will it damage your country's credibility, but it will also actually affect the sales of domestic products, which is a small loss. A special letter is requested from your association to investigate quickly and effectively stop the above situation, so that our colleagues will not misunderstand and misidentify it.</p>

<p>Rong Zongjing</p>
<h3>Goes to Hong Kong to Reorganize Business</h3>
<p>Daily Rumors About His Escaping</p>
<p>Wen Lantang Guarantees That It Is Not True</p>
<p>Shenxin Yarn Factory Will Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reported that Mr. Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Yarn Factory in this port, took the Japanese Queen of Changxing Company to Hong Kong on the 28th. This trip was to reorganize the company's business in the Hong Kong area. It is expected that he will return to Shanghai in a week. However, yesterday, the Japanese newspaper "Daily News" in this port suddenly fabricated a strange news story, saying that Mr. Rong was missing due to business failure. After investigation, it was learned that he took a Chinese ship to Hong Kong on the 27th to escape. It also said that the reasons for Mr. Rong's failure were: First, the Zhong standard of Shenxin Yarn Factory's products has not been adopted by the yarn and cloth exchange, and the Jinji trademark of Tongyi Factory has been replaced instead. Second, the failure of the cotton and wheat loan to the United States, etc. After the publication of this news, because Mr. Rong's business in Shanghai is very extensive, those who heard about it in the Chinese community expressed their surprise. Yesterday, the reporter of Hua Dong News Agency specially went to the general office of Shenxin Factory and Wen Lantang, the chairman of the yarn and cloth exchange, for interviews. According to Mr. Wen, the statement that Mr. Rong failed and escaped to Hong Kong is absolutely not true. This trip to Hong Kong is to reorganize the business of the branch company. All friends are aware of it. I can guarantee that what is published in the daily newspaper is all rumors. According to Mr. Xue of the general office of Shenxin Factory, Mr. Rong's trip to Hong Kong was also accompanied by his son Hongyuan, etc. This trip is to reorganize the branch company's business. The biggest purpose of this trip is that the branch company's recent business has been sluggish, and the Guangdong-Guangxi communications have gradually developed. Mr. Rong plans to promote business with Guangxi merchants, so he went there in person. This kind of record in the daily newspaper is deliberately trying to sabotage our country's industry, so it has been decided to warn or prosecute according to law.</p>
<p>Introduction by the International Trade Bureau</p>
<h3>Promoting Domestic Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Salted Zinc Nettle Ramie and Soybeans, etc.</p>
<p>Hope that various manufacturers will contact and sell</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the International Trade Bureau has spared no effort in promoting domestic products. Recently, various places in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia have requested the introduction of industrial raw materials for purchase. Yesterday, the following was specially published:</p>
<h3>Java Needs Pure Salt</h3>
<p>Pure alkali and calcined alkali are important raw materials in the chemical industry, such as the manufacture of glass, soap, paper, and bleaching and dyeing. They are widely used. Clean alkali is an indispensable raw material for baking powder, soda water, bleaching and dyeing, and medicine. Crystal alkali is used for bleaching and dyeing, washing, tanning, and making clean alkali. Alum is a necessary raw material for tap water plants, nitrate plants, paper mills, glass factories, dyeing, printing, photography, medicine, and other chemical industries. Now, Tan Li Dian Company in Batavia, Java, has sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau, willing to promote these industrial products. Please contact the manufacturing manufacturers to promote them.</p>
<h3>Belgium Needs Zinc Sand</h3>
<p>Zinc sand is produced in Shuikoushan in Hunan Province and Yunnan and other places in Sichuan Province. It is a necessary product for printing and electrical materials. A certain mining company in Antwerp, Belgium, has sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau, intending to purchase zinc sand in China. Please contact the various mining merchants and export merchants to discuss promotion with the company.</p>
<h3>The United States Purchases Chinese Ramie</h3>
<p>Ramie is produced in Jiangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangdong, and other provinces, and is sold to the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and other countries. The annual amount is about 200,000 dan, which is used to manufacture canvas ropes and other ramie textiles. Recently, Berlin, a textile factory in the United States, is seeking ramie samples and asking various ramie merchants to negotiate prices for sales.</p>
<h3>South Africa Plans to Operate Soybeans</h3>
<p>Soybeans are produced in the three northeastern provinces, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and other provinces. More than one million dan are exported to the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong every year. Recently, a company in South Africa sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau to inquire about soybeans and soybean meal, and the market price for delivery to Africa. The bureau has notified the various soybean merchants in this port to contact for promotion.</p>
<p>Navy Jiangfeng No. Machine</p>
<h3>Coastal Flight to Fujian This Morning</h3>
<p>Arriving in Fujian Today, Returning to Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>Successive Test Flights to the Southwest and North China</p>
<p>The Jiangfeng aircraft, made by the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau, after being converted into a seaplane, has flown long distances from Shanghai up the Yangtze River to Nantong and Hankou. However, long-distance flights along the coast have not yet been attempted. Therefore, it has been decided to depart from the Longhua River seaplane airfield at 7:00 this morning, still piloted by instructor Xu Chengqi, to fly to Fujian to test its long-distance flight capability, in order to make a plan for flying throughout the country. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Test Flight Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>In order to be cautious and thorough before the Jiangfeng seaplane made a long-distance coastal flight, Zeng Yijing, the director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau, specially, at 1:30 p.m. yesterday, in front of the hangar door, carefully inspected the fuselage and parts, then started the engine and drove to the center of the river. Piloted by instructor Xu Chengqi, and accompanied by one person in the back, it flew straight upstream of the Huangpu River. After two circles, the aircraft safely returned and stopped at the original location.</p>
<h3>Fuselage Markings</h3>
<p>The Jiangfeng aircraft was originally an amphibious training and reconnaissance aircraft. Its engine is 165 horsepower, and the engine is an American Cyclone type, manufactured at the end of 1931. After it was converted into a seaplane, Director Zeng Yijing was ordered to test the model and made a long-distance flight along the Yangtze River from Shanghai. The results were good. Later, the aircraft was further repaired, the fuselage was painted gray and white, the tail rudder had blue stripes, and the upper and lower wings were painted with the Kuomintang emblem of the blue sky and white sun. The floats were painted purple-blue.</p>
<h3>Flight Plan</h3>
<p>The aircraft is currently trying a long-distance coastal flight, passing through Ningbo and Wenzhou, where it will rest briefly, and then fly directly to Fujian. It is expected to arrive at the port around 2:00 p.m. Tomorrow, it will return to Shanghai from Fujian. If the long-distance flight capability is good, the second long-distance flight will be to Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou, and then back to Shanghai from Guangzhou. The third flight will be to Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping in North China. On the one hand, the plan to fly the aircraft throughout the country will be completed, and on the other hand, it will be used to awaken the people of the country, promote aviation to save the country, and recognize the flight capability of China's self-made aircraft.</p>

<p>After the Yang Umbrella Workers' Strike</p>
<h3>Labor and Capital Both Petition</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News, all the workers of 53 Yang umbrella factories in the city, including Huali Times, went on strike because they opposed the factory's reduction of wages. The capitalists of each factory jointly petitioned the Municipal Party Department yesterday morning, requesting that the workers be ordered to resume work immediately, while the workers also sent representatives to petition the Party and government yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Industry Peers Petition: Fifty-three umbrella factories in the city, including Minhua, Lixin, Liyong, Ruilin, Nanchang, Continental Global, Meili, Fengli, Huali Times, etc. in the Republic of China Road area, were outraged by the sudden strike of workers on the 27th. Yesterday morning, representatives from each factory, more than 50 people, hired a moving car, holding petition banners, and went to the Municipal Party Department at Fenglin Bridge to petition. Zhu Chunbo, Lu Zhankui, Fang Ziju, and other five people were elected as representatives, and were received by Lu Yinchu, a cadre of the Civil Movement Section. After the representatives stated that the workers went on illegal strike and beat and insulted the capitalists, they requested that they be strictly restrained. Lu Jun said that he would immediately convene the Social Affairs Bureau to convene a mediation to avoid prolonging the labor unrest. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>Workers' Demands: According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Yang umbrella workers went on strike, yesterday afternoon, the Yang umbrella industry vocational trade union sent Fu Bichen and other four people to submit a document to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the illegal actions of the capitalists be stopped. The workers also announced that, according to the workers' investigation, the Yang umbrella industry's sales volume in 1929 was only more than 800 dozen per day, but now it is more than 1,600 dozen per day, which has doubled compared to before. The workers' wages have been reduced instead. For example, the wage for a sewing worker was 2 cents and 2 li per top, and more than 100 tops per day could earn about 2 yuan. Now it has been changed to a monthly salary of about 10 yuan per month, and more than 180 tops must be made every day, which is really difficult to maintain. The capitalists convened a secret meeting and still took consistent oppressive measures against the workers.</p>
<p>Planned Implementation by the Ministry of Communications</p>
<h3>Commercial Vessel Load Line Law</h3>
<p>Limiting Overloading to Prevent Accidents</p>
<p>Promulgating Regulations and Hiring Experts to Handle</p>
<p>There are no laws and regulations restricting the load of commercial vessels in China, so shipowners greedy for business load more cargo than allowed, causing accidents, which are not uncommon. The Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications specially proposed to handle the load line law. It has been decided by the Shipping Administration Conference that the Ministry will actively carry out the law. The cause is investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Benefits of the Load Line Law</h3>
<p>When commercial vessels in various countries load cargo, the government has load line laws to limit the load. There are load lines listed on the ship's hull. Each ship's load must not exceed this line to avoid danger. China does not have such experts, so there are no regulations on the load line for cargo transported by commercial vessels. In fact, this matter is very important, and only those who are proficient in this subject can be competent. If the line is drawn shallow, there will be less cargo and the shipowner will lose money. If the line is drawn high, there will be danger in navigation. Therefore, the current loading of cargo on various ships does not have a statutory standard.</p>
<h3>Proposal of the Shipping Administration Department</h3>
<p>In the current Shipping Administration Conference, the Ministry of Communications' Shipping Administration Department submitted a proposal that the load line law must be implemented urgently. The implementation of this law will eliminate the malpractice of overloading cargo. The sinking of a certain ship in Ningbo and other cases, in which hundreds of people were drowned, are the most recent examples. If the load line law is implemented, the restricted loading capacity of each ship should be used to transport cargo. It is heard that the draft standard was proposed by Gao Tingzi and others.</p>
<h3>Measurement Calculation Procedures</h3>
<p>The tonnage of each vessel and the structure of the hull compartments are also different. To carry out this law, experts must first assist the local shipping administration bureaus to go to each commercial vessel to measure the depth of the compartments and calculate the draft of the ship's weight to determine the load line. When experts draw the line, the Shipping Administration Bureau will affix a seal to show caution.</p>
<h3>Hiring Foreign Staff to Host</h3>
<p>The original international load line convention conference was held in various countries. China has not yet joined. However, there are many Chinese commercial vessels sailing to Hong Kong, Dalian, and other ports. Since China is not within the international load line convention, it is still a question of whether the line drawn can be recognized by the officials of each port. After discussion by the Ministry of Communications, it was decided to hire Mr. Inglot, a Westerner, as a load line expert who is well known to various countries, to undertake this position in China's implementation of the load line law, to work with the Shipping Administration Bureau to measure and map the load lines of various commercial vessels, and to amend the load line law for immediate promulgation and implementation.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Telegram Praises the Yellow River Closure</h3>
<p>The Yellow River Fenglou Closure Project, since Kong Shirong, the director of the Yellow River Flood Relief and Work Relief Group, personally went to the construction site, worked day and night, and finally achieved the effect of closure in one month. Chairman Kong Xiangxi was very pleased to hear the news and sent a telegram to commend him on the 24th of this month. He also strongly urged the closure work after the closure. The original telegram said, "It is found that he took over the work midway, corrected and made up for the past projects, planned in many ways, and worked tirelessly from dawn to dusk. He was able to report the closure in a short period of time. His enthusiasm and perseverance are commendable. The closure work is of great importance, and he should still be responsible for speeding up the handling and striving to achieve complete success as soon as possible, and forever celebrate Anlan. There is a great hope."</p>
<h3>Food Transportation and Sales Bureau Has Difficulty Raising Funds</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi Goes to Gan to Visit Jiang and Ask for Instructions</p>
<p>And Request to Unify the Yangmi Tax in Fujian and Guangdong</p>
<p>The Food Transportation and Sales Bureau of Eight Provinces convened a conference of representatives of the municipal governments and rice industry in various provinces in Shanghai on November 27 last year, and the preparatory committee produced the subscribed funds, which were limited to be paid before January 10 of this year, in order to convene a shareholders' meeting and formally establish the bureau. As of this month, only four provinces and one city, including Shanghai, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan, have paid the subscribed funds, and the actual amount is still less than 500,000 yuan, so the progress is very difficult. Gu Xinyi, the director of the preparatory committee of the bureau, in order to promote the early realization of the transportation and sales bureau, will specifically go to the Nanchang Bandit Suppression Headquarters Command Headquarters within the next week to visit Chairman Jiang to report on the progress and ask for instructions on the bureau's future plans, and ask Chairman Jiang to levy the Yangmi tax in Guangdong and Fujian as soon as possible in order to save the rural economy.</p>
<p>After the Dissolution of the Sichuan River Convention</p>
<h3>Navigators Discussed Aftermath Measures Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the shipping companies in the Sichuan River jointly increased the water feet, and the Shanghai Sichuan gangs went on strike in opposition. After the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce mediated and decided on a solution, the Shanghai foreign shipping companies were dissatisfied and dissolved the alliance. The Sichuan gangs and navigators gathered yesterday to discuss the measures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Merchants Gather to Discuss: The case of shipping companies operating in the Sichuan River forming an alliance to increase water feet, after the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce and others held a meeting in Chongqing to decide on a solution, the Shanghai foreign shipping companies were all dissatisfied. After a meeting, it was decided to dissolve the convention. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, a joint meeting was held at the Navigation Club on Guangdong Road in Shanghai. Those present were Yu Qiaqing, representatives from seven companies, including British Taikoo, Jardine, French Jufu, American Jiejiang, Italian Yihua, and privately operated Sanbei and Minsheng. Representatives from each company expressed their opinions. They all expressed their support for the dissolution of the alliance convention. However, the methods after the dissolution and the water foot prices were still not decided due to differences of opinion. It was dispersed at about 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Sichuan Gangs Negotiate: The Shanghai Sichuan gangs, such as Suhuo cotton yarn hardware, etc., all expressed their acceptance of the mediation method of the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce. It was originally scheduled to resume transportation on April 1. Now, because foreign shipping companies object, and the alliance convention has been decided to dissolve, a special negotiation was held yesterday on the issue of resumption of transportation, which must be determined according to the water feet of each shipping company. Therefore, the handling of goods is temporarily suspended. As for the water feet of each shipping company after the dissolution of the alliance, they have not been opened and are mostly in a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

<h3>Continuing to Reduce Freight for Alkali Products</h3>
<p>The Two-Way Bureau received an instruction from the Ministry of Railways stating that the raw materials used and the products produced by the Yongli Alkali Manufacturing Company, during the establishment of the company, for 30 years, transported by the state-owned railway, were charged freight according to the second-class foreign goods, which was in accordance with the Order No. 12 of the Executive Yuan. The instructions were followed by the General Administration Office on January 10, 1929, and ordered the roads to comply. Now, the Order No. 1257 of the Executive Yuan has been received, "Because the company is now expanding its capital and also operating the nitrogen industry, the responsibility is even greater. The original plan to maintain the company's alkali manufacturing part's exemption from taxes and reduction of freight has been passed by the 150th meeting of this court. In addition to distributing to the Ministry of Industry, Finance, and Communications, the public should follow," etc. The above has been presented and distributed to the roads to continue to comply with the original plan, and the roads are urgently ordered to comply with the plan and to instruct the subordinate to comply with it as a whole.

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Requesting Yiguan to Release Native Cloth</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying, "Nanjing Ministry of Finance Junjian, on the 28th of this month, we received a letter from the Native Cloth Industry Association stating that we received a letter from the Yichang County Native Cloth Industry Association stating that native cloth is a commodity that has been specially approved by the central government to be tax-free. There has been no problem in running anywhere for a long time. However, the native cloth merchants in Yichang are now attaching their arguments to the native cloth to transport it to Sichuan Province, and have already obtained a unified tax license in Yichang in accordance with regulations. However, the Yichang Customs is causing difficulties and refusing to release it," etc. After investigation, the hand-woven native cloth has been handled uniformly at home and abroad after the customs duty was exempted by the government. The cloth merchants have obtained a unified tax license, and the Yichang Customs should handle it in accordance with the tax-free goods, and should not cause any difficulties, causing panic in the operation of the merchants. The matter is related to the credibility of the tax-free license. For this reason, according to the letter, we earnestly request the General Assembly to condole the difficulties of the stagnant business transportation and the credibility of the tax license, and to quickly send a letter to the Commander of the Jianghai Customs to instruct the Yichang Customs to investigate and handle the case, and not to cause any difficulties, so as to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. We are infinitely grateful," etc. After investigation, the tax exemption for native cloth was ordered by the Ministry, and it is said that the cloth merchants have obtained a unified tax license, and the procedures are also in compliance. The Yichang Customs should not add difficulties. Based on the above, we hereby telegraphically request Jun Department to review and approve it, and give us a telegram to exempt the tax, so as to comply with the general case. It is really convenient for the public. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce salutes."</p>
<h3>Japanese Woman Opposes Manchuria and Resists Japan</h3>
<p>The Daily News Records Sakura Chunyama's Heroic Deeds</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News published in Shanghai on the 27th, the Japanese woman Sakura Chunyama, from Nagasaki, lost her father at the age of ten and her mother at the age of eleven. After that, she wandered around in an impoverished journey. In May at the age of twenty-seven, she met a Chinese in Osaka. The two were deeply in love. In April at the age of twenty-eight, the two packed up and went to Dalian. Since then, they have traveled back and forth to Manchuria and Mongolia, leading a life of bandits. Later, she had a love affair with Zhang Chunyui, a staff officer under Li Du, and her lover was also killed. Because she was favored by Zhang's staff, Sakura Chunyama actually took control of military power. She was able to control thousands of subordinates, who all obeyed. When the September 18th Incident occurred, she avoided the pursuit of the Japanese army and fled to the Russian-Manchurian border, planning strategies to oppose Manchuria and resist Japan. At the end of December of the year before last, due to the joint attack of the Japanese and Manchurian armies, she retreated to the dense forests of North Manchuria. Later, she surrendered to the Japanese army. The Japanese army forgave her past and allowed her to submit. Unexpectedly, after our army (the Japanese army) withdrew from Muling, she raised the banner of rebellion again, gathered her comrades, and fled to the Russian territory, planning to resist Japan. At the end of January of this year, she led more than a thousand people to surround and attack Hulin County, causing heavy losses to our army (the Japanese army) and the Manchurian army. It is heard that she has been pursued by the Japanese army again and fled to the Russian-Manchurian border, becoming the queen of opposing Manchuria and resisting Japan.</p>
<h3>Achievements in Collecting Land Price Tax</h3>
<p>The Total Last Year Was About 120,000 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Municipal Government presented to the Central Government for approval to delineate the Municipal Dust District and began to collect land price tax, although some owners have requested the tax to be levied due to the increased burden, after the Municipal Government has repeatedly extended the deadline and explained in detail, all owners are now able to pay in accordance with regulations. According to investigations from various parties by reporters, it is heard that the land price tax in the second half of 1933 has been concluded, and the collection results are better than those of the land tax. According to the past, the government's collection of land tax only averaged 70%, while the land price tax collected last year reached more than 80%, totaling about 120,000 yuan. However, the scope of the land price tax collected at the end of last year was limited to the two districts of Huhai and Zhabei in the Municipal Dust District. Now, when the land price tax for the first half of 1934 is about to begin, the authorities will also collect the tax in the districts of Pusong and Fahua, which have not yet been levied.</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter went to Zhang Jianming, the director of the levy service of the Land Bureau yesterday, and it is said that the land tax item in the city has always been collected by the Land Bureau. Now, after a righteous degree assessment, it is felt that the nature of the land tax and the convenience of the levy should be transferred to the Finance Bureau for execution. It is more appropriate. At present, this plan has been resolved and will be implemented immediately. The Land Bureau is now engaged in sorting out such documents and preparing to transfer them. As for the Finance Bureau, it has been decided to start receiving them on the 1st of next month.</p>
<p>China Foreign Relief Disaster Relief General Association</p>
<h3>Shanghai Office Relocates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Foreign Relief Disaster Relief General Association, located at 49 Nanjing Road, after Xie Andaoguo was sent by the Beiping General Association to Shanghai to preside over the affairs, is said to have prepared a new plan to develop the association's affairs in the city and along the Yangtze River. Because the original office site is narrow and insufficient for application, after consultation with Mr. Chen Guangfu, the chairman of the Yangtze Advisory Committee of the association, it will move to the sixth floor of the Guohua Building at 356 Beijing Road from April 1, and has issued a notice to all walks of life. In addition, after the Yellow River flood, the association launched a fundraising campaign in Shanghai, and the results were very good. Together with the donation from Hong Lai in the United States, a total of more than 64,000 yuan was received. Since the fundraising campaign was launched, it has been nearly five months, and it is scheduled to end within a day, and the donation pamphlets issued are also planned to be recovered in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Russian Impersonating French Consul and Chief Inspector</p>
<h3>Prosecution of Fraudulent Major Sum Case</h3>
<p>=Fan Gongru and Xu Haidu Overwhelmed by Greed=</p>
<p>=Plots to Establish Gambling Houses, Only to be Swindled by Unscrupulous Russians=</p>
<p>丨Four Russian Perpetrators with a History of Crimes, Detained for Investigation丨</p>
<p>Russian national, Lai Weisiji, 36 years old, residing at Room 603, YMCA, No. 105 Jing'an Road, Shanghai, specializing in illegal activities and fraud. A case was previously handled by the First Special District Court. Recently, together with a compatriot, Lao Mainuofu (39 years old, residing at No. 451 Mai'erxi'ai, operating a café), the two had a far-fetched idea. They colluded to impersonate Bai Le'ai, the Deputy Consul of France, and the Chief Inspector of the French Police, and other titles. They instructed two compatriots, Si Dui Nao Fafa (40 years old, residing at No. 13, Lane 855 Xiafei Road) and Bao Baofu (32 years old, residing at No. 268 Xiafei Lane), to introduce Fan Gongru, residing at No. 5 Lishui Lane, Danshui Road, Public Concession, and Xu Haidu, residing at the Taiyang Temple, Zhabei. They claimed that they could secure approval for establishing gambling houses in the French Concession, and demanded 30,000 yuan in "lobbying fees." In December of last year, Lao Mainuofu introduced Fan and Xu to meet with Lai Weisiji at the French Consulate to discuss the matter. Fan and Xu, failing to discern the truth, believed them. They first paid 2,000 yuan in cash, with the remaining sum to be delivered after approval. The other day, Fan and Xu hosted Lai and Lao at the Deng Tuo Moxi Hotel on Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession to celebrate their "success." Unfortunately, the scheme was discovered by Jin Jiulin, the Chief Inspector of the Special Agency of the French Police, who reported it to Fo Langdeng, the Deputy Inspector of the West. Mr. Fo personally led Qian Wenlong, a secretary, and Chinese and Russian detectives to the Deng Tuo Moxi Hotel. They apprehended the four Russians, Lai, Lao, and others, and initially took them to the Huishi Police Station before transferring them to the French Police Station for further investigation. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The police have already examined the past criminal records of the Russians. Lai Weisiji was found to have committed fraud in the Public Concession in 1931 and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the First Special Court. He was also tried by the First Special Court for a trademark fraud case in August 1929. Lao Mainaofu was arrested for attempted kidnapping in the Public Concession in 1931 and sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment by the First Special Court. Upon appeal, the sentence was reduced to six months. All case files are available. Yesterday, the police rushed to prepare the indictment and transferred the defendants to the Second Special District Court. Judge Sun Pengnian presided over the Eighth Criminal Court for the preliminary hearing. The four defendants were brought in by French police. The judge first questioned each defendant about their name, age, origin, address, and occupation. Subsequently, Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, stood up and stated the case, briefly explaining that the defendants had been apprehended by the police on March 29 for impersonating public officials and engaging in fraud. The police are still investigating the complex case and many accomplices are still at large. The court was requested to postpone the trial for two weeks, to detain the defendants temporarily, and to bring the accomplices to justice for a detailed investigation before proceeding with the trial. After deliberation, the court announced that the trial would be postponed to April 6 for further investigation and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further instructions. Lao Mainuofu, the third defendant, was represented by Shen Digufu, a Russian lawyer, who requested permission to provide a reliable guarantor for bail pending trial. However, the judge rejected the request due to the ongoing investigation and the police's objection to bail, and the defendants were taken back into custody by the police.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhanggen's Coffin to be Opened for Examination Today</h3>
<p>Lu Linqing's Confession After Apprehension is Extremely Cunning</p>
<p>Zhang Zhanggen's Coffin to be Transported to Shanghai Today for Examination</p>
<p>Zhang Zhanggen, from Zhangjiazhai, Nanxingwan, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was 36 years old this year. His parents are deceased. He married Zhang Ling, who is 28 years old this year. They have been married for twelve years and have a daughter, Cui Zhen, who is nine years old this year. He has a younger sister, Huang Zhang, who is 30 years old and married to Huang Chunquan of Xinguanglong. Zhang Zhanggen worked as a copper smith at the Wusong Railway Factory and had a close relationship with Lu Linwang, a fellow worker from Chongming. Later, Zhang Zhanggen had a conflict with the foreman over a six-yuan commission and quit. He then worked at a copper smith shop in Tilanqiao and befriended a colleague named Jin Lin, who lived in Tilanqiao. Zhang worked there for two months but quit due to disagreements and low wages. He has been unemployed at home for a long time. Lu Linqing was arrested on suspicion of being a Red Bandit and imprisoned in 1931, only to be released last December. During Lu Linqing's imprisonment, Zhang Zhanggen often told his wife that Lu had a grudge against him. Therefore, even though his wife did not want to reveal it, the implication was that Zhang was involved in Lu's arrest and crime. Soon after Lu's release, Zhang Zhanggen became unemployed and remained at home, struggling to make a living. On the 19th day of the first lunar month of this year, he went to Jin Lin to seek help in finding work. He stayed at Jin Lin's house for two nights. On the 21st, Lu Linqing met Zhang at Tilanqiao and invited him to his home in Wusong, promising to find a way to get him back to work at the Railway Factory. Unexpectedly, that evening, Lu Linqing went to Zhang's house to tell Zhang Ling that Zhang Zhanggen had suddenly died. Zhang Ling and her sister-in-law, Huang Zhang, rushed to see the body, but Lu covered the body with a cotton quilt and would not let them see it. He then collected money from the factory workers to buy a coffin and provide funeral expenses. He also gave Zhang Ling seventy yuan, as a condition not to involve the authorities or pursue the matter. After receiving the seventy yuan, Zhang Ling was willing to drop the matter. However, Huang Zhang, observing that her brother's ears were swollen and had a purplish mark, and his abdomen was bloated, and knowing that her brother was strong and healthy, secretly suspected his death. However, because her sister-in-law had already agreed to the conditions and the body had been coffined, and Zhang Ling had superstitious beliefs that an examination would prevent him from being reincarnated, she could only hold her resentment and support the coffin home, setting up a shrine to observe mourning. Because the women could not make a living, she intended to sell a mu and a half of inherited farmland recently. Her brother-in-law, Zhang Tangtang, argued that she had no children and he should inherit the land and did not allow the sale. In desperation, on the 26th of this month, she took her husband's memorial tablet to the Third District, Fourth Precinct, to report her grievances. The Precinct Chief Zhan asked about the circumstances of her husband's death. She described in detail the circumstances of her husband's death. The Chief suspected that the death was suspicious and asked why she had not reported it for examination. She replied that she was subjected to intimidation, pressure, and the allure of the seventy yuan. Believing that this matter was problematic, the Chief ordered her to speak directly. She then revealed the circumstances of her husband's sister Huang Zhang. The Precinct then summoned Huang Zhang to court for questioning, and then summoned Zhang Tangtang to the case, advising them to resolve the family dispute first and investigate the wrongful death. Lu Linqing was immediately arrested. Lu was uncooperative and denied everything. As the matter concerned human life, he was transferred to the Public Security Bureau and sent to the District Court for trial yesterday. Meanwhile, Zhang Ling and Huang Zhang were ordered to submit a report to the District Court requesting an examination. As it was in the afternoon, the court ordered that the coffin be transported to Shanghai the next day (today) for an autopsy.</p>

<p>A Confusing and Bewildering Marriage Dispute</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhiyun Sues Zhou Xiaobo</h3>
<p>Zhang Hires a Lawyer to File a Lawsuit and Petitions the Court for a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>She Later Claims an Out-of-Court Settlement, Leaving the Judge Utterly Confused</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiyun, formerly selected as China's first movie queen, has resided in Shanghai since divorcing her ex-husband. Soon after, she met lawyer Zhou Xiaobo, and the two mutually agreed to marry. Recently, Zhang suddenly hired lawyer Shan Yuhua to sue Zhou Xiaobo in the First Special Court on charges of violating public morals. The court has held two hearings, but neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has appeared in court. Only their respective representing lawyers have appeared. At this time, Zhang Zhiyun, after the first hearing, separately hired lawyer Tang Mingshi to submit a statement to the court, claiming that she had not filed a lawsuit and requesting the court to investigate. However, the representing lawyer of the plaintiff stated that he had indeed accepted Zhang Zhiyun's personal commission at 1:00 PM on the 23rd of this month to sue Zhou. Examining the signatures of Zhang on both statements, the styles and handwriting match. Therefore, the inside story of this case is worth pondering. The findings of the investigation and court hearing are described below.</p>
<h3>Lawyer and Movie Star Make a Pact</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiyun, 29 years old, retired from movie life and resided in Shanghai after starring in the movie "Disappointment." Last year, Zhang was taken to court by a creditor due to debt relations. At that time, Zhang hired Zhou Xiaobo as her lawyer to represent her. The two became acquainted because of this and developed into confidants. Soon after, they sought marriage. On May 3rd of last year, Gu Biaofu, a lawyer, certified the marital agreement (recorded below), and they began cohabitation with the intention of getting married later. Later, Zhang found out that Zhou Xiaobo was already married to Zhang Xiwu, the granddaughter of Zhang Tui'an of Nantong. Based on the marriage agreement, she negotiated with him, but it was ineffective. She then filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court on the grounds of violating public morals according to Article 244 of the criminal code. She also filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order Zhou Xiaobo to pay 150,000 yuan in consolation money and 50,000 yuan in damages, totaling 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>First Court Hearing Adjourned</h3>
<p>The First Special Court approved the statement and scheduled the trial for 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month in the Eighth Criminal Court, with Judge Liu Yugui presiding. Zhang Zhiyun and Zhou Xiaobo did not appear in court. Only the representing lawyer of the plaintiff, Shan Yuhua, appeared in court and stated that the client, Zhang Zhiyun, should have appeared, but because the defendant, Zhou Xiaobo, was currently asking people to mediate, she did not appear. He requested the presiding judge to postpone the hearing for ten days to facilitate reconciliation. After review, Judge Liu ruled that it would be best if the two parties could reconcile out of court. Otherwise, the location of the agreement and the defendant's precise address must be reported to the court at the next hearing. The case was adjourned to the afternoon of March 30 for further hearing before adjourning.</p>
<h3>Signatures on Both Statements are the Same</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the next day (the 24th), the court received a statement from Zhang Zhiyun separately hiring lawyer Tang Mingshi, stating that Zhang had not filed a lawsuit against Zhou Xiaobo and requesting the court to investigate. The court felt that there must be twists and turns in this matter. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the next hearing was held. After taking his seat, Judge Liu Yugui announced that the statement submitted by Zhang Zhiyun on March 24, stating that she was unaware of the lawsuit against Zhou Xiaobo and requesting the court to investigate, but the signature of Zhang at the end of the statement was the same as the signature at the end of the statement suing Zhou Xiaobo, and the handwriting was the same. The court will investigate the truth. Lawyer Shan Yuhua then stated that this situation was like child's play. To clarify the truth, the plaintiff and the defendant should be present. However, Zhang had been arrested in another case and, although bailed, had not yet been met. Therefore, the only way was to request her arrest to clarify everything.</p>
<h3>Judge Finds it Extremely Bizarre</h3>
<p>This lawyer accepted her commission, and not only was it personally commissioned by her, but she also came to see him an hour before the last (23rd) court hearing to ask him to represent her in court. She said that she could not appear in court due to various reasons, and he told her that she had to come to court in person. She also said that Zhou Xiaobo would not come, so she could not come either. The signature on the lawsuit was signed by Zhang in person at the law office of Ma Junshuo on the fourth floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road. Zhang's sister was also present at the time. Defendant's representing lawyer Wang Fubi also stated that the plaintiff and the defendant had reached a settlement on February 13th of this year and terminated the marriage agreement. At that time, lawyers Li Shiyuan and Tang Mingshi testified, and the agreement was submitted to the court. After reviewing it, Judge Liu ruled that the case was bizarre and the court would investigate it and adjourn it for another hearing. He also told lawyer Shan to ask Zhang why she was inconsistent. If the plaintiff had accepted mediation outside of court, she could withdraw the lawsuit from the court. He also told Wang that if the marriage agreement had been terminated and the defendant believed that the lawsuit was damaging to his reputation, he could file another lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Marriage Agreement</h3>

<h3>Two Horizontal Scars</h3>
<p>=Fang Aying Accuses Zhang Wubo=</p>
<p>=Claims a Cohabitation Relationship Existed=</p>
<p>丨Requests Confirmation of the Son Born丨</p>
<p>Zhang Wubo (also known as Zhang Wubai), from Zhenjiang, owner of Yongtaichang Foreign Goods Store in Taihe Lane, Fuzhou Road, was recently sued by Fang Aying, who hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to request the Civil Court of the First Special Court to confirm that the nine-year-old son Zhang Zhimin (nicknamed Gougou) born to her has a father-son relationship with Zhang. The reason is that Fang Aying (now 24 years old) had a relationship with Zhang in 1925 and lived together in a rented house. She then gave birth to Zhimin on the fourth day of the tenth lunar month of 1926. In 1928, Zhang went out on the pretext of going out and never returned. He has been away for six years without any news. It was not until July of last year that he was found, but Zhang refused to accept them. Therefore, a lawsuit was filed, and a lawyer was hired to respond. The point of cohabitation claimed by Fang was denied, saying that he had never met the plaintiff before, how could a son be born? He asked to reject the plaintiff's suit. This case was previously summoned by the First Special Court, and Fang pointed out that Zhang had two horizontal scars on his lower abdomen and cited witnesses Meng Wang and Chen Wu to prove that Fang and Zhang had indeed cohabited. Although Zhang admitted to the scars, he consistently denied any cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai opened the Seventh Civil Court for questioning, and the two sides argued fiercely. It was not possible to determine whether Zhimin was born to Zhang Wubo. The court then ruled that the case would be adjourned for further hearing and ordered both parties to go to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for examination before verification. The plaintiff was ordered to pay the examination fee of twenty yuan before adjourning.</p>

<h3>Major Theft, Russian Perpetrator Arrested</h3>
<p>The Thief Killed a Policeman in Harbin</p>
<p>Opened Fire to Resist Arrest and Escaped in Tianjin</p>
<p>Russian national, Si Dai Nafa Siji, 36 years old, formerly a driver, was arrested in Harbin for shooting and killing a policeman. He was sentenced to death by the Eastern Province Special Court. After being pardoned by the government, he transferred to Tianjin. He was again wanted by the authorities for committing a crime. When the detectives went to arrest him, he dared to open fire to resist arrest and escaped. He then fled to Shanghai and became unemployed. He colluded with a gang of fellow criminals to live a life of theft. He repeatedly committed major theft cases in the Public Concession, but luckily escaped the net. Each time, he stole goods worth about 10,000 yuan. Recently, he committed a theft case in the French Concession. The net of justice is wide, and he was finally arrested by the French Police a few days ago. Yesterday, he was resolved in the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Li Changnian presided over the trial. Because the police investigation was not completed, a postponement was requested. The court briefly questioned the defendant and approved the postponement for further investigation and trial. The defendant was returned to custody. It is now heard that the police have roughly investigated that the defendant committed three theft cases in the Public Concession and one in the French Concession. The defendant was also involved in the nearly 100,000-yuan theft case at the Xibiliya Jewelry Company on Nanjing Road last time and shared over 10,000 yuan of the stolen money.</p>
<p>Caojiadu Triangle Ground</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Red Pill Syndicate</h3>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the Detective Squad of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, learned that someone had privately set up a large-scale red pill selling syndicate inside No. 1637, the first south of the Caojiadu Triangle Ground in western Shanghai. All the arrangements were very meticulous, and the business was very developed. At 4:00 PM yesterday, he dispatched detective leader Chen Caifu to the Sixth District of western Shanghai with detectives. He met with police dispatched by the Sixth District and secretly went to the address. They seized five packages of red pills, about 200 pills, in the mezzanine inside the building, and arrested the private sellers Ma Dengyun, Ma Jinshen, and Xia Heyi. They were arrested and taken back to the Sixth District, where they were handed over to the detectives to be taken back to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchant Ship</p>
<h3>Preparations for the General Association of Radio Officers</h3>
<p>Chinese merchant ships have been equipped with radios for many years. Their function is to receive weather information, which can prevent hurricanes and fogs. In the event of ship groundings, collisions, or theft, they can send out distress calls and be rescued. The benefits to navigation are considerable. However, merchant ships travel to various places, and there are few opportunities for radio operators to connect. The improvement of machinery and the progress of learning are constantly changing. Individual research is not as effective as public discussion in gathering ideas and achieving twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, maritime communication requires communication. Just as merchant ship drivers and engineers have their own general associations, radio operators on merchant ships are aware of this and have taken steps to establish a General Association of Radio Officers of Chinese Merchant Ships. The address of the association has been set at No. 7.5 Waihan, Shanghai. Preparations were completed a few days ago and have been submitted to the Party Headquarters for formal establishment. It is heard that membership participation is extremely enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Participate in the Changsha National Exhibition</h3>
<p>Registration Has Begun and Departure is on April 7th</p>
<p>Welcome Silk, Porcelain, Stationery and Other Industries to Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, in response to an invitation from He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, to lead national product factories to participate in the National Product Exhibition to be held in Changsha on April 20, held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association's office in Nine Acres at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss preparations for participation. (1) According to a telegram from the representative stationed in Hunan, there are only one hundred booths at the Changsha National Product Exhibition. Factories that previously participated in the National Product Mobile Exhibition in Hankou have priority registration rights. (2) Silk, stationery, toys, buttons, underwear, mirrors, porcelain, bamboo ware, and other industries that wish to participate can register at the association. (3) Registration begins today and ends on April 5th. (4) The products of the participating factories will be shipped from Shanghai for participation on April 7th. It is also heard that the association, in order to save the factories money, intends to entrust the shipping to a customs broker with lower freight rates.</p>
<p>Xu Guangyu</p>
<h3>Swindling Funds in Kobe and Fleeing to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xu Guangyu, also known as Lin Jiexin, a Cantonese man of thirty-four years old, worked as a clerk at the Baltic Commercial Company in Kobe. Between December 24th and 31st of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], he forged the signature of the company's British General Manager, Mr. Eder, on three checks, defrauding the HSBC bank there of 10,797.12 Japanese yen. He then vanished without a trace. On January 6th of the following year, Mr. Eder discovered the forgery and reported it to the Kobe police, who were unable to apprehend him. He remained at large with no clues to his whereabouts. It was not until the 6th of this month that it was discovered that Xu was hiding at No. 1, Hua Ji Li, Yuyuan Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. Chinese detectives Zhang Guisheng and Chen Weikun from the Hongkou Police Station, accompanied by the bank's staff, secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him to the police station. He had spent only 3,000 yuan of the stolen money. He was once escorted to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over a continued hearing. Mr. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the plaintiff, Mr. Eder, and his wife were present in court and requested to be questioned. Mrs. Eder detailed the circumstances of the defendant's forging of the checks and withdrawing of the funds. Mrs. Eder stated, "I never instructed the defendant to commit such an illegal act. I have 71,335 Japanese yen deposited in the HSBC bank, which is sufficient for my needs. The defendant's accusations are completely false." Xu Guangyu's testimony was evasive. Judge Xiao ordered that he be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Four Beggars Aspire to Improve Themselves</h3>
<p>Request to be Transferred to the Vocational Training Center for Skill Learning</p>
<p>Li Yousheng, a beggar from the City God Temple and Yu Garden area of this city, from Danyang, twenty-five years old, along with Liu Yikang, thirty-seven years old, from Ningbo, Wang Changfa, twenty-eight years old, from Fujian, and Liu Jinhai, thirty-two years old, from Jiangbei, spend their days begging in the City God Temple area, sleeping under eaves at night. However, they suffer from constant hunger, and as a result, they repent and desire to improve themselves. However, they have no skills to make a living. Yesterday, Li Fuyi, an on-duty patrol officer from the Second Precinct of the First District, passed through the City God Temple on business. The beggars Li Yousheng and others requested that Patrol Officer Li take them to the precinct. Patrol Officer Li replied that since they had not broken any laws, there was no need to take them to the precinct. However, the beggars collectively stated, "Although we are poor and beggars, we are also born of parents. Because we have no skills, we have become beggars. Now that we are in our prime, if we do not strive for improvement, we will eventually starve to death. Furthermore, we are constantly hungry, so we are willing to endure hardship and learn a skill. We only ask that Patrol Officer Li be compassionate and transfer us to the vagrant vocational training center for skill learning, so that we may be trained. If our request is not granted, we will immediately seek death to end it all." Patrol Officer Li, taking pity on their sincerity and wanting to reduce the number of vagrants and maintain local stability, immediately brought them to the precinct for verification. After questioning the beggars Li Yousheng and others, Precinct Chief Liu Yunfang found their statements to be consistent with the above and ordered them to be presented to the General Bureau for transfer to the vagrant vocational training center for skill learning.</p>

<h3>Setting Up Promotion Vehicles</h3>
<p>In addition, the measures for organizing national products promotion vehicles are as follows: (1) This association will organize national products promotion vehicles in accordance with the provisions of the work outline, in order to promote national products and penetrate into the public, so that consumers can deeply recognize national products, and also adopt convenient methods to enable producers to more effectively promote and expand their business as the purpose. (2) Economical, flexible, and artistically designed vehicles and tents should be equipped, and the surroundings should have advertising space. The capacity for goods should be limited to what one person can push. The design and manufacturing method will be explained with separate drawings and standard prices. Each vehicle will cost about 30 yuan. The appearance should be eye-catching and appealing as the main condition. (3) The port will be divided into five major areas: East Shanghai, West Shanghai, South Shanghai, North Shanghai, and Central Shanghai. Each area will tentatively have one national products promotion vehicle, with a total of five vehicles in the port, forming a team and assigning numbers to distinguish them with separate markings. Small-scale trials will be conducted first, and more will be added if necessary. (4) The goods will be absolutely limited to national products. The person in charge must conduct strict investigations and supervision at all times. They will be divided into three major categories: clothing, daily necessities, and educational products. The detailed items will be determined separately. The wholesale of goods will be solicited by the association from various national products factories and companies with their consent, and fair prices will be set and submitted to the person in charge for handling. (5) Each national products vehicle will be staffed by two salespersons, dressed in uniform clothing. One person will be solely responsible for the vehicle's business management, goods, and money. The other person will be an assistant salesperson, not receiving a salary. At the end of each month, their turnover will be totaled, and a certain percentage will be used as a reward. However, for all business matters, they must obey the orders of the manager. (6) The salespersons of each national products promotion vehicle in each district will observe the time and depart from the starting point, following the prescribed route, to various roads and lanes. They will blow a conch shell along the way and shout to sell, arousing the public's concept of using national products. It is even more important to make them recognize the trademarks of various factories' products. They must also return on time in the evening to count the goods and hand in the accounts to settle the matter. (7) The responsibilities of the salespersons are very heavy. In addition to paying a formal security deposit, they must cultivate the spirit of perseverance, hard work, and service through work training, understand the meaning of the association's national products promotion vehicles, and possess all the necessary knowledge for business in order to be qualified. The person in charge will also conduct daily attendance checks and supervision at all times, adopting a strict management system. (8) There are advertising spaces on the national products promotion vehicles and the salespersons' clothing, limited to advertisements for national products factories and companies. Advertising fees will be charged as appropriate to cover expenses. The advertising size and style will be determined separately. (9) If there are any shortcomings in these measures, they will be studied and revised at any time.</p>
<h3>Shenxin No. 9 Factory Has No Strike</h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union Will Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>Dagong News reported that regarding the case of the workers' strike at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory on Tokyo Road in West Shanghai, a reporter from Dagong News investigated from various parties yesterday and learned that it was completely inaccurate. The workers of the factory have been working as usual for several days and there has been no strike. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Strike Is Inaccurate According to the person in charge of the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, roughly speaking, this factory took over the Sanxing Yarn Factory in the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. When it took over, the Sanxing Factory originally had more than 4,000 workers. A portion of them were given severance pay and voluntarily resigned. There were still 2,404 workers who requested that this factory continue to employ them. At that time, this factory did not agree to their request. Later, after a lawsuit in court, it was ruled that they must be employed. Therefore, this factory complied with the law and expressed its acceptance. More than 600 people have now come to the factory and been employed. Those who have not yet entered the factory have voluntarily given up. This factory hopes that they will still come to work at the factory, because the original workers of this factory are not enough to distribute the work. There is now a worker registration office. As long as they have the old worker's book from the former Sanxing Factory and it is verified to be true, they will be employed. The report that a strike occurred is completely inaccurate. It is understood that there are unscrupulous elements who intentionally incited the workers on the job to take the opportunity to cause trouble. However, the workers of this factory will never start a labor movement because of this.</p>
<p>Talk by a General Committee Member According to a member of the Standing Committee of the Municipal General Labor Union, this association received a report from the workers of the Sanxing Factory on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 29th), saying that the workers of the Shenxin No. 9 Factory suddenly went on strike to oppose the placement of the old workers of the Sanxing Factory. This association believed that there were many workers in the factory and that unscrupulous elements might be inciting them, so it immediately planned to send someone to investigate the truth today and notified Dagong News Agency by telephone to publish the news. Today (that is, yesterday), this association notified the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Department sent Yu Yaoqiu, a staff member of the Investigation Section, to investigate the factory. Only then did it learn that the so-called strike was completely inaccurate. This matter is obviously a fabrication by traitors who hope to cause trouble. The General Labor Union will thoroughly investigate it.</p>
<h3>Parcels Sent by Post Office to Inland Areas</h3>
<p>Still Collected and Sent According to Previous Procedures</p>
<p>According to Shanghai Post Office news, parcels sent by the Shanghai postal district to inland bureaus in other districts, which are not directly accessible by train and do not have customs personnel stationed at the bureaus, were originally scheduled to be inspected by customs officers of the Management Bureau from April 1 of this year to verify the contents and collect taxes according to regulations. However, since the implementation of the tax collection method has been postponed, such parcels will still be collected and sent according to previous procedures after April 1 of this year.</p>
<p>Wuzha Road</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Materials Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>One Batch Will First Go to Wuhu</p>
<p>One Batch Will Come to Shanghai Immediately</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company, which is undertaking the construction of the Wuzha Railway, has ordered all the railway materials, track equipment, and all kinds of items required from the United States. The first batch, which was loaded last month from the United States with 3,000 tons of steel materials and rails for road construction, was entrusted to the US Cotton and Wheat Loan Office's cargo ship to be transported to China and has been transported to Wuhu for unloading. The second batch of railway materials and locomotives has also been discussed by the company with the Cotton and Wheat Administration, and it has been agreed that the wheat transport ship will be used to transport them to Shanghai. This cargo has now been shipped and is on its way, and it is expected to arrive within the next few days, with a total of 1,500 tons of materials arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Representative of Shipping Households, Xing Zhigang</p>
<h3>Please Add Public Toilets Along the Bund</h3>
<p>Only One in Four Miles Along the Bund</p>
<p>Urination Along the Bund Hinders Municipal Administration</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the representative of the shipping households in Pudong West, submitted a document to the Municipal Health Bureau yesterday, requesting the addition of public toilets along the Bund, stating that he was submitting a request to restore the public toilets at Dongjiadu and other wharves for the convenience of shipping travelers. The Bund outside the Sixteenth Pier in Nanshi extends for four miles to the Lifesaving Bureau Wharf, but there is only one public toilet at the South Wharf. Ten years ago, when the shoreline of the wharf had not yet developed, the municipal office had already established public toilets in Xiaodongmen, Damatou, Dongjiadu, and other places for many years, which were contracted by the cleaning office for the convenience of travelers. Since the municipal bureaus took over the administration, the wharves along the Bund have gradually developed, and the daily traffic of travelers has been more than several thousand, and the number of dockworkers stationed there has been more than several hundred. However, all the original public toilets have been demolished, allowing ignorant dockworkers to urinate along the Bund, causing the waste to be scattered everywhere, and travelers to cover their noses. This not only pollutes the drinking water of the Huangpu River and harms hygiene, but also greatly hinders the appearance of the municipal administration along the Bund. It has been found that the Dongjiadu Wharf area is a prosperous place for the berthing of ships from various towns and villages, and it is also the most popular wharf for ferry passengers on the Upper South Motor Vehicle and for people traveling to and from the Jiangdu ferry. If the sanitary facilities are not adequate, it is inevitable that pedestrians will urinate along the Bund, which cannot be prohibited, and will hinder the municipal administration, which is extremely serious. He specially submitted a statement to your Honor, asking you to examine and approve it, and allow the restoration of the original public toilets along the Bund in Dongjiadu first, and to examine the needs of each port and add them in order to achieve cleanliness and convenience for shipping travelers. He would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association</p>
<h3>Seeking Assistance for Private Postal Bureaus</h3>
<p>Letter Sent to the Ministry Yesterday Requesting a Temporary Suspension of the Ban</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, concerned about the Ministry's strict order to ban the operation of private postal bureaus and the urgent appeals from representatives of various Ningbo and Shaoxing communities, sent a letter yesterday to the Ministry requesting that the Ministry consider the livelihood of the people and postpone the execution. The original text reads: According to the Shanghai representatives of the private postal industry, Hua Yunjin and Yin Yuantong, the Ningbo representative Wang Yuanjiang, the Shaoxing representative Wu Yunyu, and representatives from Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places, we have read in the newspapers that the Ministry of Communications has ordered the restriction of the operation of private postal services and that they be completely shut down by the end of this year, and that military and police agencies are ordered to strictly enforce this order. Our industry was shocked to hear this news. We believe that the scope of the private postal industry is extremely broad, and that countless households rely on it for their livelihood. If the industry is shut down for one day, their livelihoods will be cut off immediately. We have therefore submitted a request to the government for relief, but have not yet received a response, which is even more alarming. Most of those engaged in this industry are fellow villagers from Ningbo, so we have specially prepared a brief outline to request assistance to save this one thousand households and five thousand mouths from hunger and cold. Our industry's branches are set up everywhere, whether in prosperous cities or remote rural areas. In recent years, they have been gradually merged and closed down, with less than one-tenth remaining. However, there are still 50,000 people who rely on them for a living, all of whom are old and frail and have no other profession to switch to. If they are suddenly ordered to shut down, they will inevitably become starving corpses filling the gutters. For the sake of the people's livelihood, our industry cannot be shut down urgently. First, since the expansion of the postal service, our industry has followed the orders of the postal authorities to register, obtain licenses, weigh, and forward. Our industry has complied with everything. Under the current circumstances, the private postal bureaus are affiliated with the postal service. There is no obstacle to the unification of the postal service, and they can supplement the shortcomings of the postal service and promote the expansion of postal services. Our industry cannot be shut down urgently. Second, the business of private postal services has plummeted, which is an undeniable fact. According to its income, it is less than a drop in the bucket compared to the postal service. However, the areas it operates in are mostly places where the postal service has not yet been established. The impact on the overall revenue of the postal service is minimal, and it has a long history of operation and is closely related to social commerce. It is not easy to order it to shut down in the short term. Our industry cannot be shut down urgently. Third, farmers, workers, businessmen, and people living in different places, because they have not received education, are ignorant of postal services and repeatedly inquire about remittances for their families, causing delays. Moreover, the remittances they raise are mostly small amounts, and the places they are sent to must be in remote rural areas. The recipients are mostly women, who feel great pain in traveling back and forth. For the convenience of the people, our industry cannot be shut down urgently. Fourth, in recent times, industry and commerce have declined and rural areas have gone bankrupt. The government is afraid of unemployment and is constantly planning relief measures. Our industry also belongs to the people and should be protected, and we cannot let them suffer to the point of freezing and starvation. For all the above reasons, please appeal for a postponement of the shutdown in order to maintain livelihoods. We cannot help but wait urgently for orders. The association found that the private postal service has a long history, and that if it is suddenly ordered to shut down, the livelihood of the people will be worrying, which is indeed the case. According to the above information, it is necessary to urgently send a letter to your office, asking you to examine and approve it, and to consider the difficult situation of the industry and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of employees, to make proper arrangements for the aftermath, and to temporarily suspend the ban, so that the national economy and the people's livelihood can be taken care of at the same time. We would be deeply grateful and ask for a reply, etc.</p>
<p>Municipal Zoo</p>
<h3>The Large Animal House and Thatched Pavilion Completed</h3>
<p>Tourists Crowd in the Bright Spring Sunshine</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank Sells Tickets on Behalf</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Zoo has developed greatly since Director Shen Xiangrui took office. The four giant beasts, lions, tigers, bears, and leopards, previously housed, only had two large animal houses, which were insufficient. Therefore, a request was made to the Municipal Education Bureau to allocate funds to add two more houses for safety. The Education Bureau then submitted a collective request to the Municipal Government for approval. The Municipal Public Works Bureau invited bids for construction, and it is now learned that the new houses have been completely completed and inspected, and the two animals, bears and leopards, have been moved in. The large thatched pavilion built at the same time for visitors to rest has also been completed. At this time of bright spring sunshine, tourists are extremely crowded. Therefore, purchasing tickets at the zoo entrance has made visitors feel inconvenienced due to crowding. The zoo, in view of this, was pleased to receive Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank of the Old West Gate’s agreement to voluntarily sell tickets on behalf. The zoo immediately submitted a request for approval to the Education Bureau. Therefore, from April 1st, from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily, and from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Sunday mornings, tickets can be pre-purchased at the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank of the Old West Gate to avoid crowding when buying tickets at the zoo entrance.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association Handles Abuse of Daughter-in-Law Case</h3>
<p>Cruel Mother-in-Law Relies on Power to Abuse Weak Daughter-in-Law</p>
<p>Refuses to Treat Illness and Instead Deprives of Food</p>
<p>On the 27th of this month, the China Child Welfare Association, introduced by lawyer Wang Peiyuan, received Ning Linmei, who claimed that her niece, Ning Shilian, was being abused by her mother-in-law, Zhu Genda, and had fallen ill. She was refused treatment and deprived of food for three days. The association immediately sent investigator Zhao to visit and investigate. She first went to the Song Pan family at No. 6, Hua Xin Li, across from the Dacheng Factory in Yangshupu. They claimed that her husband, Song Ajin, had been doing business overseas and had been away from home for a long time. The family was poor, so they married their daughter, Song Shilian, to Zhu Kangkang, who lived in Zhangjiazhai, Guiyang Road, Yangshupu, last March. Since she entered the family, she has often been cruelly treated for trivial reasons. The instigators were her grandmother-in-law, Zhu Wang, and Zhu Genda, who colluded to abuse her. The husband, Zhu Kangkang, was still young and indifferent to her suffering. As a result, she became ill from accumulated depression and was bedridden. She was sent to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment in May of last year, and was discharged in June of the same year and sent back to the Zhu family, hoping that she would be well. However, she was still abused, and her abuse intensified, causing her old illness to recur. Her mother-in-law's family refused to send her for treatment, and she had no choice but to take her back for treatment at the beginning of last month. She was only sent back a few days ago, and her illness has not yet healed. The Song family is very poor and unable to take care of her any longer. They only express their helplessness. They heard that recently, the cruel mother-in-law and others took advantage of the weak girl's illness and imposed a hunger strike on her to hasten her death, so they asked your association to provide relief. Investigator Zhao immediately reported the situation to the Grand Road Police Station in the district. The head of the station ordered Senior Officer Liu Changgen to visit the Zhu family to confirm the situation. He reported back to the police station, and the head of the station assigned Western Detective Tang Bosheng to investigate together. At that time, Zhu Wang, Zhu Genda, and Zhu Kangkang had all fled, leaving only Song Shilian moaning in bed. The detective immediately informed her aunt to accompany the patient to Sacred Heart Hospital, and asked the hospital to issue a diagnosis to serve as the basis for detaining and accusing the parties involved.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Has Many Madmen</h3>
<p>Once Treated, All Recover</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest trading port in China, with a vast area, dense population, and a mix of people from all over. There are often mad men and women wandering aimlessly on the streets. Recently, the Weihai Police Station detained two unnamed mad men and women and handed them over to the First Special District Local Court, which transferred them to the Shanghai Mental Hospital on Ren'an Li, Guling Road, for treatment. After careful diagnosis and treatment by the hospital, in less than ten days, they were surprisingly sane and revealed their names. One was Wu Xiang, from Haimen, and the other was Xu Zhou, who lived at No. 141, Behind Fenshui Temple, Zhabei. The hospital prepared a letter to report to the First Special District Court and separately sent the two recovered mad men and women to their families to be taken back and supervised. There was also a madman named Ma Wei'en, a Cantonese man living in Ding'an Li, Haining Road, who, after being treated by the hospital, has now recovered and safely discharged from the hospital and returned home.</p>
<h3>Opening of Three Locations of the Kaili Company</h3>
<p>Welcome to Visit, Yellow Cars Provided Free of Charge</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Leishi, a prominent Cantonese businessman, observed the decline of China's silk industry in recent years. Although affected by the sluggish market, he also saw the need for improved business methods. Therefore, he gathered like-minded individuals to organize a large-scale Kaili Silk Branch Company. Preparations have been underway for several months. The overall plan is to establish seven branch locations in different districts of Shanghai: (1) Nanjing Road, (2) Avenue Joffre, (3) Bubbling Well Road, (4) North Szechuan Road, (5) Yu Garden Road, (6) Zhabei, and (7) Nanshi. This will be carried out in three phases. The first phase involves setting up the three stores at (1), (2), and (3). The decoration of the buildings has been completed, and the grand opening will be held simultaneously tomorrow (April 1st). The first store is located at 765 Bubbling Well Road, corner of Carter Road, telephone number 31737. The second store is located at 55 Nanjing Road (corner of Szechuan Road), telephone number 16651. The third store is located at 603 Avenue Joffre, telephone number 83500. The business policy will focus on small profits and courteous service, completely eliminating the arrogant habits found in old-fashioned stores. To welcome guests to visit, three measures have been implemented: (1) Starting from the opening day, visitors can hire a yellow car to go there, with the store paying for the fare. This free transportation offer will be valid for three days. (2) Customers who purchase goods totaling 15 yuan or more will receive one free sewing service, valid for seven days. (3) The store will establish a new tailoring department, acting as an agent, with particularly low prices.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of the manager of Shen Xin No. 9 Factory, who expressed great surprise upon reading today's issue of your newspaper, which stated that workers at our factory had declared a strike.

Therefore, we respectfully request that your lawyer send a letter requesting a correction.</p>

<p>Question and Answer on Reading</p>
<h3>How to Study the Constitution</h3>
<p>This is a continuation of yesterday's discussion on (1) the attitude of the people towards politics, (2) the meaning of the Constitution, and (3) the methods of study. Today, we will continue to discuss the methods of study. - Editor</p>
<p>Some people believe that, although parliamentary politics are often manipulated by a minority, the ideal of popular politics, or democracy, is still laudable. We should eliminate the manipulation of power by a minority, but we should not oppose democratic politics. Therefore, they believe that the reason why democratic politics cannot be realized is only that the election is not effective or that the parliamentary system is a more potent poison that anesthetizes the public, completely masking reality, without asking under what conditions democratic politics can be realized or why democratic politics cannot be realized in the present society. The realization of true democratic politics must have the premises that "the whole society is harmonious" and "everyone's interests are consistent." But is present society "harmonious"? Are "everyone's interests consistent"? Naturally not. Looking at the few famous democracies today, such as England, America, and France, we only see that two major barriers have been formed in their societies, appearing on the political stage in a posture of mutual struggle. Especially in today's stage of imperialism, due to the disintegration of the capitalist system and the gestation and growth of new production relations, the opposition of these two barriers is becoming increasingly acute in politics, forming one in protecting and consolidating this regime, and one in destroying and fighting for this regime. The political form expressed is the arrogance of tyrannical politics; on the other hand, it is revolutionary unrest and the establishment of new regimes. In the midst of this turbulent political situation, false democratic politics are coming to an end. Thus, the head of the Department of Politics at the University of London, the famous scholar of the intelligentsia, Laski, also had to say with difficulty, "False democratic politics are coming to an end..." But democratic politics itself is not a fantasy. As long as there is no such conflict of interests between people as there is now, the true "general will" of the people will appear, and true democratic politics will naturally not be impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>Secondly, the study of the Constitution should be done as a whole, studying from the connections of things. We should not only see the provisions of a certain chapter, but also see at the same time what other provisions that are prerequisites for the realization of this system are like. For example, slogans such as "freedom" and "equality" are probably just some indispensable clauses in the Constitution now, but in reality, they are not. "Freedom of assembly" is legally available to everyone, but the lower classes in society, where do they have meeting places, how can meetings be held! Freedom of speech can only be exercised within the scope of not harming the status of the rulers. Money is required to be elected to manage national politics. Therefore, the so-called "equality" and "freedom" have other pre-determined conditions, which cannot be guaranteed or obtained solely by clauses. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The book has not been translated by anyone else since it was published recently. Moreover, because the book lists many personal names and proper nouns, the translation is extremely difficult. Fortunately, the translator knows Princess Rong Ling, the younger sister of the original author Der Ling (Rong Ling is also known as Princess Shan Shou, the wife of General Tang Baochao, who also served as an attendant lady of Cixi for many years and authored the book "Fragrant Concubine"). With her guidance, it has been possible to translate each item without losing its true meaning, and she has also made many corrections on behalf of the translator.</p>
<p>All the illustrations in the original book are from the hand of Miss Bertha Lumu, a British friend of the original author, Princess Der Ling. Miss Lin currently lives in Beijing. Her painting style is unique, meticulous and lively. The characters she creates are lifelike. It is said that all the illustrations in Der Ling's books are from the hand of this lady.</p>
<p>(This book will be published from tomorrow, April 1st)</p>
<h3>Malay Chieftain Wants to Marry a Japanese Wife</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhiru</p>
<p>In the South Seas, among the Greater Sunda Islands, there is a K-shaped island at the eastern cape of Borneo, which is Celebes. This wonderful place has lush green mountains and clear blue lakes, with the warm and pleasant spring light of the southern countries. Although it was governed by the Netherlands in 1660, as part of the Dutch East Indies, it still retains its native chieftain's throne. The reason why it has not changed its customs is that this is a tactic of the Dutch to implement colonial policies, giving him a little empty glory so that they can enjoy their success in peace.</p>
<p>Dr. Kimachi Yoshiharu, a professor of medicine at Hokkaido University in Japan, traveled in the South Seas last year and studied tropical endemic diseases. He returned to Japan last month and gave a speech saying that the practice of early marriage in Celebes is very prevalent. According to statistics, the average age of young mothers is eleven. Also, due to unsanitary conditions, the infant mortality rate is 47% in the first year of life, and there are more mentally retarded and deformed children. When he was in Makassar, the local chieftain asked him to diagnose his illness. Therefore, he knew the chieftain's family history and current situation in detail. He said that the chieftain has always admired the gentleness of Japanese women, who are most able to be gentle and considerate to their husbands. Therefore, he will soon come to Japan to travel, following in the footsteps of Prince Achmad Abija of Aceh, and also wants to marry a Japanese woman as his concubine. His words seemed to imply that he would act as a matchmaker, bringing about a beautiful match.</p>
<p>The arrogant Japanese people, who rely on their strength to be arrogant, will soon see a Japanese girl marrying a native chieftain of an uncivilized ethnic group. The beautiful girl is marrying a dark-skinned man, and the colorful phoenix is following a crow. Although it is unethical, it is another way in Japan's southward policy.</p>
<h3>Recent Poems by Yu Kan</h3>
<p>— Shi Yun</p>
<p>▲ Traveling Alone in Mochou Lake</p>
<p>The double oars and misty waves have gone, I come here to wander alone. The painted beams and carved pillars are all different from the past, Only the name of the lake is still Mochou.</p>
<p>The beautiful eyebrows in the painting are truly real, The dressing building faces the spring of the Six Dynasties. Do not climb up and make a thousand-year thought, The lake and mountains have belonged to beautiful women since ancient times.</p>
<p>▲ Climbing Shengqi Tower</p>
<p>Zhongfu's peaks are unparalleled, The heroes' bet for victory has turned to dust. I also have the intention of playing chess, But who is the opponent?</p>
<p>▲ The Spring Orchid in the Room Suddenly Withers and Feels赋</p>
<p>How can the fragrance of the room be easily spread, No wonder it ends hastily. Still remaining sick leaves and withered flowers, How can I not be heartbroken when facing each other.</p>
<p>▲ Short Message The reason why pulmonary tuberculosis is called a tricky disease in the medical community is that, although there are many new anti-tuberculosis drugs on the market, it is difficult to find one that is truly effective. The Yijincao, issued by the Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company at the intersection of Zhaozhou Road and Xilin Road outside the old Ximen in Shanghai, can cure coughs that have lasted for one or two decades, as well as dangerous emergencies such as spitting blood and wheezing. It is now heard that the herb has been tested successively by famous Chinese and Western doctors such as Ding Jiwan, chairman of the National Medical Association, and Ding Zhongying, director of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Medical Center, and has been given official certificates to commend it.</p>
<h3>The Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Six: Vigorously Explaining His Aims, Forgetting the Home and Serving the Country, Lamenting My Yearning for People Facing the Jade Mirror</p>
<p>Gui Zhi smiled and chatted with Man Ying for a few words. Seeing that Mr. Qin didn't seem to be leaving, and that he was sitting here interrupting their mood, he stood up and smiled, "I'm going to say goodbye. Come to Haidian to play if you have time." Man Ying quickly stood up and blocked the door, saying, "Why? You've come such a long way, and you're going to leave before you've even had a cup of tea?" Gui Zhi said, "I've been in Beijing for a while, staying with relatives. I'm going back to Haidian now, so I came to visit you by the way. I promised to go home today, and if I'm late, my mother will be waiting." As he spoke, he took Man Ying's hand and smiled, "See you another day. We won't stand on ceremony." As he spoke, he squeezed past her. Seeing that he was about to leave, Man Ying couldn't force him to stay, so she followed him to the front door. Gui Zhi thought all the way home that he had many things to discuss with Man Ying. But seeing Man Ying's state of mind, she no longer had Commander Tian in her mind. If he were to talk to Man Ying about missing her husband, wouldn't he be running into a brick wall? Moreover, the fact that Mr. Qin was sitting in the house and didn't get up to leave because a female guest had arrived wasn't a solution either. But did Mrs. Huang agree with her daughter doing this? He wondered and went home. Mrs. Jiang was greatly surprised and asked repeatedly, "What's wrong? Were you delayed in the city?" Gui Zhi had already prepared his answer, so he said, "Miss Huang wasn't home, and their old lady wasn't feeling well. What was I doing there bothering people?" As he spoke, he went straight back to his new room. That night, it was a rainy night in late autumn. Gui Zhi ate dinner and pretended to sleep, closing the door. (350)</p>
<h3>Research on Inkstones (X) (IV)</h3>
<p>— Bored Guest</p>
<p>▲ General Overview of Duan Inkstones ▲</p>
<p>(4) Lyrics About Inkstones From a literary and artistic perspective: From the Tang and Song dynasties to the late Qing dynasty, there are countless poems, lyrics, and proses about inkstones in previous people's collections and various chronicles, but they are either empty praises, or praises of the people involved, or narratives of the events, and there are very few general insights into the research on the beauty of the inkstone material. Recently, I purchased a volume of ink paintings by Mr. Wu Bangzhi, "New Records of the Duanzhou Inkstone Pit of Zhou Zuzhen" and "New Spectrum of Duanxi Inkstones," with ten attached lyrics. According to Mr. Zhu Shouzhi, these lyrics were sent by a friend in Guangdong, and no one in Guangdong knew who wrote them. However, the lyrics are quite knowledgeable about the material of Duan inkstones, and I have recorded them as reference materials for those who study Duan inkstones.</p>
<h3>Ten Lyrics on Duan Inkstones</h3>
<p>Duanxi inkstones come from afar, from Lingnan. Carving holes to take materials is dangerous. Digging mountains and opening passages is costly. Not easy to reach the study.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, distinguish them, don't be hazy. Inside the rock, you must distinguish between upper and lower. Inside the cave, you must also distinguish between west and east. The quality is very different.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, there are many kinds. Light purple sheep liver, owl's eye. Red haloed horse's tail, turtledove spots. Banana white, shallow and deep.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, I compare them to you. Greasy and moist, like soft jade. Melting and smooth, like condensed fat. The top grade must be like this.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, the best thing is the blue flower. Sparkling clear waves float with water chestnut. Vaguely azure, reflecting clouds. Lively and fresh.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, try tapping them without sound. Simple and natural, like wood. Gentle and beautiful, how can they make a golden sound? Most avoid clear clanging.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, use them well and they will be excellent. Inking is quick, meeting friends with glue. Dipping the brush, it seems to enter the land of water and clouds. Happiness is in the study.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, beautiful quality, but many flaws. Flames clamp sand, hard as iron. Yellow dragon wraps insects, rotten as mud, dark blemishes are also not suitable.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, true appreciation is passed down by people. Recognizing the eyes is easy to mistake for Sanshui stone. Seeking completeness, you can buy half of the mountain. Better than facing the sky.</p>
<p>Duanxi inkstones, do not cut off from the ancient. Carving leaves and engraving flowers ridicule vulgar patterns. Carving dragons and engraving phoenixes spoil good materials. Widely making disasters of stone.</p>

<h3>Suzhou in Spring</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fu</p>
<p>In this paradise-like Suzhou, spring has quietly arrived. Although the plum blossoms have withered, the willows have sprouted green leaves, and the apricots are budding red calyxes. The earth above is covered with a layer of misty new green. This is indeed the most suitable time of year for touring! There are many people there. Now I will briefly describe one or two of Suzhou's famous scenic spots and historical sites for the reference of general tourists.</p>
<p>▲ Mountain Section</p>
<p>Although the mountains of Suzhou lack majestic atmosphere, they are beautiful and secluded, and have a gentle beauty. Gui Youguang's Wu Mountain Illustration makes people feel reluctant to leave after reading it, generating a sense of beauty. In addition, the artificial construction of famous scenic spots has gradually added, just like a seventeen-year-old girl, wearing flowers and powder, making people more reluctant to give up.</p>
<h3>Tiger Hill Mountain</h3>
<p>The closest to Suzhou is of course Tiger Hill Mountain, where the King of Wu was buried. Although Tiger Hill is a small mound, it has gradually increased in recent years due to new construction, and the old scenic spots have been renovated, making it winding and worth seeing. The tall pavilion built on the top of the mountain has two famous plaques, Yu Youren's "Tiger伏阁" and Wu Yinpei's "挹爽阁", hanging together in the pavilion. Climbing the pavilion and looking far away, the city walls and mountains and forests are all in view. The Changxingguan Hotel on the main street at the foot of the mountain has all the fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs raised in the river, waiting for guests to cut fresh, and the taste is extremely delicious.</p>
<h3>Lingyan Mountain</h3>
<p>Because the woman from Zhuluo Village was fortunate enough to live on the top of the mountain for some time, although the site of the palace of the beautiful woman has been changed to the palace of the Brahma emperor, the Lingyan scenic spot finally relies on the relics of Xizi, and is known as the most beautiful place in the world. The absolute beauty can indeed be passed down through the ages. Lingyan Mountain is located in Mudu Town, west of the region, and there are ferries that can通通there. In the future, after the Sumu automobile road is built, transportation will be more convenient. The ancient sites on the mountain, such as Qintai, Xizi Cave, Xiangxie Corridor, and Dressing Table, are all relics of Xizi. Recently, Lingyan Temple on the top of the mountain has been extensively built, and the architecture is magnificent. Looking at Taihu Lake from the bell tower in the temple, one can see a fragrant trail, as straight as an arrow piercing into the lake. The scenery is very观的.</p>
<h3>Tianping Mountain</h3>
<p>Since the construction of Jingfan Road last year, the transportation of Tianping has become much more convenient. From Mudu, you can take a sedan chair or rickshaw for about five miles to reach the foot of the mountain. Gaoyi Village at the foot of the mountain is the ancestral tomb of Fan Zhongyan, a great Confucian of the Song Dynasty. The thousands of stone tablets are all facing the sky, with a unique majestic atmosphere. There is Batiyu精舍 on the mountain. The spring water there is clear, mellow and thick, and is known as the third spring in the world. Above, there are also various scenic spots such as Shangbaiyun, Zhongbaiyun, and Yixiantian. Those strange stones, like Zhuo笔峰, Feilaifeng, and Wuzhangshi, have poems praising them and are famous in Wumen.</p>
<p>In addition, the mountain where life is entrusted in Guangfu Town, the Xuangmu Mountains. It is famous for its plums throughout the country, and the Qionglong Mountain of Shanren Bridge. The halls on the top of the mountain are connected to the clouds, and the fragrance is spreading, which is very盛极 for a time; the Tianchi booklet of Baimajian is secluded and winding, with a unique charm, but the transportation is not as convenient as Tiger Hill and other mountains, and it takes more time to return. As for Qizishan and Shangfangshan, although the transportation is closer, the scenery is not much to see. Except for the time when Xiang Fan is visiting, it is difficult to attract tourists to go.</p>
<p>▲ Water Section</p>
<p>Although there are places such as Shihu Lake in Suzhou's water, there is no衬托旁's. It is vast and boundless. In this spring season, it is not suitable for a light boat to容与 in the middle of the stream. The water in Suzhou, Shihu Lake is famous for its moon, which is suitable for游玩 in autumn, and the lotus flowers in Lotus Pond are suitable for消夏. As for the 36,000 hectares of Taihu Lake, although it is obviously a quiet and beautiful sight, it is similar to West Lake, but because there is nothing to decorate it, and the wind and waves are too恶恶, it is not suitable for游玩.</p>
<p>▲ Garden Section</p>
<p>Although more than half of Suzhou's gardens have been颓废, the scope has not changed much since there have been no wars. The following places are the gardens that are currently open and easy to游览.</p>
<h3>Lingering Garden</h3>
<p>It is located on Lingering Garden Road outside阊门, and is the legacy of the盛氏. Due to the reverse property problem, it was once entered into public ownership, and it was not returned until recently. The furnishings of the garden and temple have been减色 a lot after this change. The garden has a楠木厅, with exquisite carvings, which is a unique building in Suzhou gardens. In addition, the halls, trees, etc., still maintain the magnificent style of a large family.</p>
<h3>West Garden</h3>
<p>Located on the west side of Lingering Garden, it is the release pond of戒幢寺. That pond of clear water is huge, clear and sparkling可爱. A hexagonal pavilion is built in the pond, and winding stone bridges are built on both sides. The carp and turtles in the pond are huge and lively, and are very有名. The waterside pavilion on the池畔 has recently been拆去 because it was rebuilt into a Buddhist hall.</p>
<p>In addition, the park on the皇废基 in the city is most suitable for夏季乘凉. Recently, Zhang Garden on the小河沿 outside阊门 has also been容人游览, and is the rising star among the gardens.</p>

After much discussion, the principles for the South China region football competition were set as follows: (1) Provincial and Hong Kong team members are distinguished by those who have actual employment at their respective locations; (2) One match will be held in both the province and Hong Kong, with the following supplementary measures: (a) Ticket revenue will be divided equally, with the home team receiving 40% and the away team receiving 60%; (b) Each team will be responsible for its own expenses; (c) The first match is scheduled for April 8th in Hong Kong, and the second match is scheduled for April 14th in Guangzhou; (3) Two representatives each from the sports authorities of the province and Hong Kong will be responsible for initially selecting the South China regional representative players; (4) After the South China regional representative players are selected, they must reside in Hong Kong and undergo at least one week of training. The Hong Kong Sports Association will cover the accommodation and meal expenses in Hong Kong. Supplementary rule: After the South China region football competition against the East China region, the athletes who will attend the 10th Far Eastern Games will be further selected by the National Far Eastern Games Preliminary Competition Committee.</p>
<p>▲Distribution Method of Football Candidates</p>
<p>The National Sports Association decided earlier to hold the football and swimming preliminary selections in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Sports Association has scheduled the swimming preliminary selection for the 13th and 14th of next month. As for the football preliminary selection period, it has recently been set around the 20th. Although this preliminary selection is in Hong Kong, Shanghai athletes have also decided to participate. The squad is capped at 17 players. The National Sports Association intends to have Shanghai select 6 players, and Hong Kong and Guangdong select 10 players, to form a team together. We have always been unmatched in this sport, but unexpectedly, we drew with Japan in the previous games, forming a confrontational situation. Whether we can achieve victory this time is a major question. The reporter met football celebrity Mr. Feng Jingxiang and asked him about the Far Eastern Games football championship this year. Feng said that the candidates for the Chinese football team have not yet been decided, so it is impossible to draw conclusions. However, based on my observations, since the last draw with us, the Japanese government has adopted a desperate approach and decided to compete with us in the next games. They are working hard in training and are said to have made excellent progress. If we want to defeat them, we must exert all our strength to succeed. Also, the Philippine football team is very strong this year. Whether we can win the championship is a real question. If China does not want to win the championship, that is fine, but if it does, we should concentrate the team and train diligently from today onward to be successful. It is not feasible to gather a team together at the last minute.</p>
<p>▲South China Prepares for Volleyball Selection</p>
<p>In order to win glory for the country in volleyball, the Volleyball Committee of the Provincial Sports Association specially selected 32 basic team members from the province. They will first hold several practices and exhibition matches in various locations in the province and Hong Kong, and then go to Shanghai to participate in the preliminary selection competition. It is reported that most of the selected basic team members are students from universities such as Zhongda and Lingnan. In order to prepare the selected players to participate in the Far Eastern Games and win glory for the country, the Provincial Sports Association sent letters to various school principals on the 24th, requesting them to grant public leave to the selected players. The selected players include Huang Yingjie, Liang Jietang, Guo Linxiang, Li Fushen, Tang Sheqin, Li Lianying, Zheng Yukun, Ma Yuanju, Wu Yongqin, Liu Zemin, Lin Bojun, Huang Jiliang, Huang Ruikai, Jin Zizhang, Zhu Guolun, Chen Zhenhe, Yu Pingxiang, and others, totaling 32 people. (Note: According to the previous announcement by the National Sports Association, there was talk of not holding a preliminary selection competition for volleyball. The general distribution of candidates will be based on the Shanghai championship team from last year's National Games, with a few players from Guangdong and Hong Kong added.)</p>
<p>▲China Plans Not to Participate in Baseball</p>
<p>Regarding China's baseball representative to participate in this year's Far Eastern Games, the National Sports Promotion Association previously sent a telegram to the Honolulu Chinese team seeking their consent to serve as the representative. Recently, the Promotion Association received a reply stating that due to the team's disorganization this year, they are unable to serve as the representative. Therefore, the production of the representative this time is planned to select outstanding talents from Guangdong, Tianjin, and Shanghai to form a team. However, some members of the National Sports Commission still feel that China's baseball strength is not strong enough, so there is a suggestion that this sport should not be participated in.</p>
<p>Today's Western League Football</p>
<h3>Youyou vs. Lakers at Recreation Ground, Donghua vs. Western Police</h3>
<p>At 3 PM at the baseball field</p>
<p>丨French Army Wins Group E Championship丨</p>
<p>Today and tomorrow's Western League football: Youyou and Donghua have major matches scheduled. Today's match between Donghua and Western Police is well worth watching, but Donghua's performance is deteriorating and unpromising, so there is no reason to be optimistic. It is hoped that they will rally their spirits and reverse the decline. Youyou vs. Lakers at Recreation Ground is sure to be a fierce battle. Tomorrow, Donghua will play Western Merchants again, hoping to avenge the shame of last week's defeat. Youyou and Jinan will meet at the baseball field. Yesterday's Group E final between Chinese Police and the French Army ended with Chinese Police losing 3-5.</p>
<p>▲Today's Saturday Schedule</p>

<p>▲French Army Wins Group E Championship</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese Police played the French Army in the Group E final at Shen Garden Field. The field was still very slippery, making movement very inconvenient. After the French Army kicked off, Chinese Police conceded a goal in less than three minutes, but they managed to tie the score within five minutes. In the first half, Chinese Police led 3-2. Unexpectedly, in the second half, they suffered a disastrous defeat, losing 3-5, which was a great pity.</p>
<p>▲Chinese Police Scored First　　The French Army kicked off first and scored within three minutes, setting a new record. Chinese Police were not to be outdone, passing the ball several times, and Dong Zhaobin scored, tying the game. In the 20th minute, Yao Jiafan also scored. However, what was easily gained was also quickly lost, as the French center Ge Ge'er scored a goal. In the 35th minute, Chinese Police defender Ma Bingzhang committed a handball foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Ge Ge'er took the penalty kick, but the ball went out of bounds from the right corner and missed. After that, Liao Zhongqian crossed from the right corner of the French defense, and the French goalkeeper panicked. Dong Zhaobin caught up and pushed the ball in, giving Chinese Police a 3-2 lead.</p>
<p>▲The French Army Came from Behind　　After the break, the French Army launched a desperate counterattack. In the confusion, Chinese Police's Ma Bingzhang tripped an enemy soldier and was penalized with another penalty kick. Ge Ge'er took the kick again and scored from the right corner. From then on, the Chinese Army's situation deteriorated, with enemy figures constantly appearing in front of the goal. The front and rear defenders were overwhelmed. Fortunately, goalkeeper Yin Xingsheng was quick and agile, saving many dangerous shots, but they were eventually attacked and conceded a goal. The score became 3-4, and the French Army turned defeat into victory. Although Chinese Police wanted to attack, they were unable to do so due to lack of energy and the fact that many players were injured and fatigued. As a result, they suffered another setback, and the final score was 3-5, with the French Army winning and taking the championship. The Chinese Police team members were as follows:</p>
<p>Liao Zhongqian</p>
<p>Ma Bingzhang, Miao Huaguo, Qian Zuzi</p>
<p>Yin Xingsheng, Yang Peisheng, Dong Zhaobin</p>
<p>Xue Ziwen, Xu Shuchen, Qiu Tiansheng</p>

<p>China Cultural Construction Association</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch Established Today</h3>
<p>Meeting at the Lake Society at 2 PM</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Cultural Construction Association has been prepared and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Lake Society, Guizhou Road, at 2 PM today (31st). All registered cultural organizations and members can participate. Notification letters have been issued.</p>
<h3>Initiation of the Cultural Organizations Joint Association</h3>
<p>Actively Carrying Out Preparations for the Inaugural Meeting</p>
<p>Various cultural organizations in Shanghai have recently initiated the organization of the Cultural Organizations Joint Association. The preparations are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Initiating Organizations</h3>
<p>Recently, more than 300 well-known cultural organizations in China, including the Youth Life Society, Wang Liu Literary Society, Modern Thought Society, Shanghai Cultural Association, Lion's Roar Literary Society, University News Agency, Sunday Literary Society, Literary Spring and Autumn Society, and Sunrise Literary Society, initiated the organization of the China Cultural Organizations Joint Association in view of the lack of solid connections in the Chinese cultural circles at the present stage, to unite cultural organizations across the country to jointly complete the new cultural movement in China as its mission. Recently, the association has been actively carrying out its work, and it is reported that cultural organizations from all over the country, both domestic and overseas, have joined, and it will be established soon, which will be a new phenomenon in Chinese cultural circles.</p>
<h3>Origin of the Initiative</h3>
<p>The origin of this association lies in the belief that the mission of culture is to reflect the times and simultaneously propel them forward. However, due to the turmoil in the overall social state over the past decade or so, China's cultural movement has experienced a stagnation in its cultural development, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, the current Chinese cultural scene remains in a state of chaos, where feudal and anti-era cultures can still prolong their existence. This undoubtedly necessitates the accelerated advancement of China's New Culture Movement to eliminate the survival of feudal literature that hinders the times and lay the foundation for a new Chinese culture. To accelerate the advancement of our New Culture Movement and to unite the Chinese cultural community to jointly undertake the mission of promoting culture, there is an urgent need for the strength of a group to facilitate this great task. Therefore, the United Federation of Chinese Cultural Organizations has emerged to meet this objective and concrete need. We believe that many scattered cultural groups in China, while having different environments and forming different tendencies, share a complete consensus on the need to complete the New Culture Movement and undertake the mission of the times, moving towards the path of light. Therefore, we understand our mission and deeply feel the necessity for Chinese cultural groups to join hands and cooperate. We welcome the participation of cultural groups across the country, and we also hope that the United Federations of Cultural Organizations around the world will actively respond to us in order to complete this great mission.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Preparations</h3>
<p>It is reported that the association's initiating group has convened a preparatory meeting to jointly plan the process. Furthermore, in addition to cultural organizations from various countries around the world expressing their willingness to cooperate recently, it welcomes the participation and cooperation of national cultural organizations to promote China's New Culture Movement. The association's general preparatory office is temporarily located at No. 12 Luyang Village, Connaught Road, it is said.</p>
<h3>Modern Thought Society's Second Lecture</h3>

<h3>Change of County Education Bureau Chiefs Yesterday</h3>

The Provincial Department of Education specially appointed County Magistrate Pan to supervise the handover to ensure its solemnity.</p>
<p>Order from the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<h3>Each School to Elect Model Children</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to municipal and registered private primary schools, stating, "In accordance with the official letter from the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee, it is found that the upcoming Children's Day is approaching. To encourage children's progress, the committee plans to hold a city-wide election of model children from primary schools. However, given that the number of primary school students in the city exceeds 100,000, and they are scattered throughout the city, gathering them is not easy, and a general election is difficult. Therefore, it is proposed to adopt a school-based election method, where each school selects one child from its own students according to the standards set by the committee, who will be the model child for this year's Children's Day. Subsequently, a re-election will be held every year before Children's Day, and a group photo will be taken during the Children's Day celebration ceremony, and gifts will be distributed as a souvenir to show solemnity. All detailed measures have been formulated by the committee and are hereby communicated to you. Please investigate and immediately notify all public and private primary schools in the city to comply with this order and jointly participate in this grand event to achieve significant results, etc., along with a copy of the election measures. In accordance with this, the original measures are hereby copied and issued, ordering each primary school to abide by this order. The main points of the measures are excerpted as follows: (1) Standards for model children: (1) Good health, (2) Full of vigor, (3) Excellent academic performance and conduct, (4) Diligent service. (2) Candidates for model children in each school are not limited by age, gender, origin, or grade level. (3) After the model children are selected by each school, their names, gender, age, grade level, origin, special talents, and photos of the children must be submitted to the Children's Welfare Committee. (4) The model children of each school should be escorted by the teachers of each school to the venue of the Children's Day celebration ceremony and gather with the Welfare Committee for a group photo. (5) In addition to the gifts presented by the Welfare Committee, the model children of each school may also request the Municipal Education Bureau to酌情免除all or part of their tuition fees as an incentive. (6) The model children of each school are the model children of the city, and there will be no further elections. (7) The model children of each school will be elected once a year before Children's Day. Detailed measures will be determined by each school. 法租界" (French Concession)</p>

<h3>Academic Lecture by the Vocational Education Society Today</h3>
<p>The third academic lecture of the seventh session of the China Vocational Education Society will be held at 4:00 pm today, inviting Xue Cixin, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, to speak on the topic of "Municipal Engineering." Mr. Xue is a municipal expert with rich knowledge and experience. Mr. Xue is also instrumental in the planning and construction of the city center area. Those who are interested in studying municipal engineering can attend the lecture. It is also learned that the society recently published a record of academic lectures, which is a record of the lectures by celebrities such as Pan Gongbi, Huang Yanpei, Yan E'sheng, and Xiang Yuancun in the last semester, with a total of twelve lectures. The topics covered international issues, economic issues, and youth self-cultivation in three periods, which are truly good reading materials for young people. The price per volume is set at three yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuben Women's High School Striving for Improvement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Wuben Women's High School in this city is a school with a long-standing reputation among women's schools across the country. Since Ms. Yan Zhenyu took office last winter, she has planned and strived for improvement in all aspects. In terms of equipment, the library has been expanded, physics and biology laboratories have been added, a sports room has been created, the cafeteria has been renovated, ordinary classrooms and special classrooms have been redistributed, office spaces in various places have been unified, and all school buildings have been renovated. In terms of catering, attention has been paid to cleanliness, and the affairs office has been inspecting it daily. In terms of academics, the level of Chinese and English has been improved to achieve a balanced development of Chinese, English, mathematics, and science, and the progress of each subject has been set to meet the limits of the curriculum standards. Strict examinations are conducted, and attention is paid to various extracurricular assignments. Each science has a research group for teachers and students to cooperate, and various competitions are held for awards. In terms of moral education, absolute strictness is adopted, and scientific methods are used to cultivate disciplined actions. Recently, Ms. Huang Ya'e, a moral education teacher, has been selected to go to famous women's high schools in Beijing and Shanghai to investigate moral education matters in order to adopt the strengths of each school and formulate a moral education program suitable for the environment of this city. In addition, the home economics group of the normal school, which has been on a trial basis for three years, is far from the purpose of combining education with production. Therefore, it has been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau to change to an ordinary normal school starting from the new students recruited in the 22nd academic year. All students in the 20th and 21st academic years will still be in the home economics group, and the curriculum will be revised until graduation. Recently, public and private community groups from far and near have been inquiring about detailed information about the school, and there are many every day. Therefore, several teachers and staff members of the school have been hired to rush to compile the school magazine, and a systematic report on the organizational overview and improvement plan will be made for the reference of outsiders. In addition, a textbook committee for each subject has been formed, and it is currently sending letters to various middle schools across the country to investigate textbooks in preparation for unifying textbooks and determining progress in the next semester. This kind of work is still an initiative in middle schools across the country. Now, Principal Yan has hired Chen Duanzhi, the director of teaching affairs, to plan in detail, it is said.</p>
<h3>Completion of the New School Building of Wusong Middle School</h3>
<p>The Municipal Wusong Middle School was destroyed in the January 28 Incident. After years of active operation, it has been restored to its original state. Yesterday, the completion ceremony of the new school building was held. Pan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Weng Zhilong, President of Tongji University, Tang Zuanzhi, Municipal Commissioner of Wusong, Zheng Xigu, Principal of Shanghai Middle School, Wu Renqi of the Eighth District Party Department of the Municipal Education Association, and more than 20 guests from all walks of life attended. The meeting started at 10:00 am. All teachers and students of the school and guests gathered in the gymnasium and performed the ceremony as scheduled. Principal Cheng Kuanzheng reported on the destruction of the old building during the January 28 Incident and the situation of the restoration and construction of the new building after the war. The language was quite sad and vigilant. Then Director Pan, Weng Zhilong, Zheng Xigu, Tang Zuanzhi, and others gave speeches one after another, praising the spirit of the revival of Wusong Middle School and encouraging it to carry forward and have a bright future. Starting at 1:00 pm, there was a show and a movie.</p>
<h3>Three Points of Opinion on the Draft Constitution's Chapter on National Education (Part 1) by Xie Engao</h3>
<p>The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and education is an important tool for the spiritual construction of the country. The constitutions newly formulated by various countries in the modern world almost all have special chapters or articles on education, and their emphasis on the status of education has become a unified trend today. In the constitutions of European countries such as Finland and Lithuania, there are special chapters on education. The constitutions of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Portugal, Spain, Poland, Romania, Greece, and Asian countries such as Turkey, and African countries such as Egypt all have special articles on education. It can be clearly seen that my country had special articles on education in the Constitution of the Republic of China promulgated on October 10, 1923, and special chapters on education in the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the Political Tutelage Period promulgated on June 1, 1931. The Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China formulated in the first year of the Republic of China and the Constitution of the Republic of China formulated in the fifth year of the Republic of China did not mention a single word about education. From this, we can know that the improvement of the status of education in our country's laws has been very different between yesterday and today.</p>
<p>Recently, the Legislative Yuan formulated the first draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China and publicly solicited opinions. Among them, the chapter on national education (Chapter 4) has a total of 13 articles. All principles regarding national education policy, education goals, supervision of education undertakings, protection of education rights, compulsory education, education funding, and rewards and protection for academic culture are still based on the Provisional Constitution during the Political Tutelage Period, but compared with the constitutions of various countries, it cannot be said to be detailed. However, China is a backward country, and education, whether from a qualitative or quantitative perspective, is still far from our ideals. The low level of public knowledge is evident everywhere, resulting in a lack of significant progress in all national construction undertakings. If China is to become a modern nation, the fundamental solution is to first promote education with all our strength and improve public knowledge, and then the country will have hope for transformation. Therefore, from the perspective of China's national conditions, there are at least the following principles that need to be supplemented in the Constitution's chapter on education:</p>
<p>1.  Compulsory education funding must be jointly borne by the central and local governments. Compulsory education in our country has been carried out from the third year of Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty to the present, and the total number of out-of-school children in various places still has alarming records. The reason for this is not only due to the lack of efforts in promoting education administration, but also the difficulty in raising local education funds, which is indeed a significant fact. According to the Ministry of Education's preliminary plan for the implementation of compulsory education, there are approximately 37.19 million school-age children who have not yet enrolled in the country. If each person needs 7 yuan of education expenses per year, then more than 260 million yuan of education funds need to be raised each year before compulsory education can be popularized. If these more than 260 million yuan are completely limited to being raised by the 1,943 counties across the country, on average, each county must increase the burden of compulsory education expenses by more than 130,000 yuan per year. Other teacher training and equipment purchases are not included. However, most of the local education funds in the counties are already abnormally stretched. Not to mention other things, even in Jiangsu, which is known as rich, the total amount of education funds in each of the 61 counties in the province is only more than 60,000 yuan, according to the statistical report of the Jiangsu Education Department. Less than half of them can exceed 130,000 yuan. As for other poor provinces, the original education funding in each county is mostly only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and some are less than 1,000 yuan. Even if all of it is transferred to compulsory education, it is still insufficient. Moreover, there are many local education undertakings. In addition to compulsory education, there are also so-called senior primary schools, kindergarten education, social education, secondary education, and education administration, all of which require the use of funds. Moreover, the current sources of funds in various parts of our country mostly come from miscellaneous donations and special taxes, which are burdensome and difficult to ensure that they will not be abolished in the future. It may be difficult to increase the amount of compulsory education funds for a while, which may not be allowed by the facts. It is not "waiting for the Yellow River to run clear" to expect local governments to do so. According to the precedents of various countries in the world, compulsory education funds are mostly jointly borne by the central and local governments. For example, the central government bears one-half and the local government bears one-half in the United Kingdom; the central government bears nine-tenths and the local government bears one-tenth in Sweden; the central government bears one-tenth, the province bears three-tenths, and the local government bears six-tenths in Switzerland. The salaries of primary school teachers in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are borne by the central government, and other expenses are provided by the local government. The same is true for village primary schools in France. The central government bears one-fourth and the local government bears three-fourths for urban primary schools. Before the new constitution was promulgated in Germany, the central government subsidized a part of the salaries of primary school teachers, and the local government bore a part. After the new constitution was promulgated, it was completely changed to be borne by the central government. The central government also bears a part of the expenses for public primary schools in Italy and Spain, and the rest belongs to the local government. The funding for compulsory education in the United States has always been shared by the state and local governments. Since the European War, educators have also advocated subsidizing local education with one-tenth of the national treasury revenue. In Japan, the national treasury fund subsidizes the annual salary increase of primary school teachers, and some people are now advocating increasing it. It can be seen that compulsory education is a national education policy, and the country can never stand aside and not bear the financial responsibility. Referring to foreign precedents and considering the domestic situation, I believe that our country does not want to popularize compulsory education. If not, the distribution of compulsory education funding should be that the central government should bear at least 30 percent, the provinces should bear 20 percent, and the counties can only bear 50 percent. In cities directly under the Executive Yuan, the burden of provinces and counties is covered by the city treasury. For poor provinces and counties, the proportion borne by the central government should be increased to make promotion as beneficial as possible and achieve the goal of universalization as soon as possible. As for the 30 percent borne by the central government, the annual expenditure is more than 78 million yuan. At first glance, it seems too large. In fact, this number is less than one-third of the military expenditure borne by the central government. If the central government's education funding can be increased to 15 percent of the total budget (see Article 40 of the draft), then the required amount should not be a problem. Otherwise, it would be reasonable to use salt tax to transfer it, because salt tax is a universal tax, and the tax rate is the same, which is rare in various countries. The tax revenue reaches more than 100 million yuan per year. Regardless of the poor and rich classes, this kind of obligation must be borne. Although it was mortgaged for the Five-Power Post-War Loan in 1913, it has gradually been repaid and can be transferred in a blink of an eye. If there is still a shortage, inheritance tax and income tax are the best resources for education funding in other countries. Our country may as well follow suit.</p>

<h3>The Most Precise Voltmeter</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The ordinary voltmeter has a resistance of only a few hundred or a few thousand ohms. This kind of low-resistance meter requires a lot of current when the pointer swings across the full scale. Therefore, it can only be used in circuits with extremely low resistance (such as measuring the voltage of dry batteries or storage batteries). If it is used to measure the voltage in high-resistance circuits (such as the voltage of B-power supplies), then, due to the internal and external resistance, most of the voltage will drop in the high-resistance circuit, and the value indicated on the voltmeter is only a small part of the actual voltage.</p>
<p>To measure the voltage in high-resistance circuits, a high-resistance voltmeter is commonly used. Although this voltmeter has a very large resistance (approximately one thousand ohms of resistance per volt) and is very sensitive (only 1mA of current is required to make the pointer swing across the full scale), it still consumes a part of the external current. Therefore, the value it measures is still not the original voltage. This can be proven by the fact that when an AC radio is turned on, no matter how high-resistance voltmeter you connect to it, the volume will always be reduced.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the accuracy of the value measured by the voltmeter depends on the amount of its own resistance. In other words, the smaller the external current consumed by the voltmeter, the more accurate the value measured.</p>
<p>The voltmeter introduced in this article is designed based on the law of mechanics that "when action equals reaction, the object remains in a static state." When in use, it does not consume any external current. Therefore, the value it measures is the actual voltage in the circuit.</p>
<p>The diagram shows a commonly used B-power supply that can supply 550 volts. R1 is a 50,000-ohm linear potentiometer.</p>
<p>V is a voltmeter with a corresponding value, and MA is a milliammeter with a range of 0. When using it, first turn the potentiometer to zero degrees (as shown in point a in the diagram). After connecting the voltage E to be measured to the (+) (-) terminals, the voltmeter V will have a reading. Then slowly turn the potentiometer towards B, and at the same time adjust R2, until the pointer of the voltmeter drops to zero, and the milliammeter is exactly roMa. At this time, according to the above law, the value of the voltage E to be measured is O·OrXr volts.</p>
<p>Because R1 is a linear potentiometer, its value increases in a certain proportion. Therefore, the value of R can be directly calculated from the degree indicated on the potentiometer dial. For example, if the rotating dial of the potentiometer is divided into 100 degrees from zero to the maximum point, then the value of each degree is equal to 5000/100 = 500 ohms. That is, when roma passes through R1, each degree is equal to o·orX500 = 5 volts. For example, if it is assumed that from A to C in the diagram is 50 degrees, then</p>
<p>E = o or × r</p>
<p>= o.or × (50 × 500)</p>
<p>= o.or × 25000</p>
<p>= 250V.</p>
<p>Or = 50 × 5 = 250V (each degree equals five volts)</p>
<p>To obtain more accurate test results, a differential dial can be added to the potentiometer dial (please refer to the author's "The Most Precise Dial" in Issue 12 of this publication), which can measure values to half a volt (o·5V).</p>
<h3>Self-Oscillation Super-Shortwave Radio</h3>
<p>— Jian Cun</p>
<p>When listening to super-shortwave radios with a wavelength of 60 mc (5 meters), the method of non-grid feedback has always been used. However, when using the non-grid feedback method, it is inevitable to have noise interference and the disadvantage of lacking selectivity, which often troubles those receiving super-shortwaves. In order to remedy the above shortcomings, a more stable self-oscillating method (Autodyne method) is specially introduced, which achieves excellent results in receiving the frequency band of 56 mc to 60 mc. Its circuit is shown in the first diagram.</p>
<p>There is no feedback coil (Tickler-Coil) in the diagram, and at first glance, it does not seem to use the feedback method. However, a high-frequency choke coil R·F·C· is inserted in the cathode circuit first diagram.</p>
<p>The cathode circuit forms a common impedance with the screen grid circuit, which causes feedback. The value of this cathode choke coil does not need to be strictly accurate. For example, a value of about 2.5 m.h can be suitable for receiving the 56 mc and 28 mc frequency bands. If this choke coil is removed and replaced with a non-inductive resistor of several hundred ohms, it can also be used. However, at this time, the detector tube will generate self-bias due to the audio frequency current, which is not desirable. The feedback degree is adjusted by changing the screen grid voltage with the potentiometer R. If a directly heated triode tube (such as the No. 56 tube) is used, feedback can also be induced in the same way. However, if a screen grid tube is used, the sensitivity adjustment is easier.</p>
<p>Second diagram</p>
<p>The connection of the whole machine is shown in the second diagram, which is a circuit with one stage of high-frequency amplification, feedback detection, and one stage of audio frequency amplification. As shown by the dotted line, the antenna is coupled with a coil or a capacitor. However, in super-shortwave, no matter how appropriate the shielding is, self-oscillation is prone to occur in the high-frequency circuit. Therefore, in order to prevent self-oscillation, it is necessary to choose an appropriate grid load.</p>
<p>The main components required for the second diagram are listed below:</p>
<p>L·········16 gauge enamel wire, 3/8 inch cylinder, 8 turns,</p>
<p>L2·········Same as above, 10 turns</p>
<p>CC5············Small capacitor, 4 plates,</p>
<p>C1C3C4···100 uuf·</p>
<p>C12··········1 to 2 2uuf</p>
<p>R·FC·······2.5 mh</p>
<p>R···········100,000 to 220,000 ohms</p>
<p>R1············2 to 10 megohms</p>
<p>R6··············500 ohms</p>
<h3>Crystal Single-Tube Radio · Ming Xiang ·</h3>
<p>Although crystal has detection characteristics, it has no amplification capability. Therefore, the output volume of a radio using only crystal detection is extremely weak, and the receiving distance is very short. If a stage of vacuum tube power amplification is added after the crystal detection, the volume can be greatly increased. The radio introduced in this article is simple and effective, and is most suitable for comrades who are making radios for the first time to experiment with.</p>
<p>The circuit is shown in the diagram. The coil L2 and the capacitor C1 together form an adjustment circuit, which is fed to the crystal detector, and then a No. 33 power pentode is used for audio frequency amplification. What is different about this circuit from ordinary ones is the antenna coupling method. L1L2L3 is an ordinary three-circuit coil. The screen grid feedback coil L1 is connected in series with the antenna coil L3 to serve as the antenna coupling coil. Rotating the feedback coil changes the tightness of the antenna coupling. The closer the coupling, the stronger the sensitivity, but the worse the selectivity, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The grid negative voltage of the amplification tube is obtained from the voltage drop across R1. The capacitor C3 is an electrolytic type. Because of its internal structure, it contains a slight inductance value. Therefore, in addition to allowing the audio frequency current to flow smoothly, this capacitor also has the function of a high-frequency choke coil. Its positive and negative poles must not be connected incorrectly, otherwise it may be burned through.</p>
<p>For power supply, the A battery only needs a 2-volt storage battery, and the B battery is best to use a 135V dry battery. The power plug is the discarded plastic base of a four-pin vacuum tube. Connect it according to the diagram. When using it, you only need to insert the plastic base into the lamp holder. The AB power supplies are all connected. This saves procedures and prevents the vacuum tube from being burned due to incorrect wiring.</p>
<p>Diagram 1</p>
<h3>Rectifier Circuit (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>There are many methods of rectification. The common ones are chemical rectification, mechanical rectification, and vacuum tube rectification. The former two are usually used to make chargers or for amateur experiments, and are rarely used in general AC radios, so they will not be discussed here. Now, let's briefly describe vacuum tube rectification. As shown in Figure 1, it is a half-wave rectifier circuit using a two-pole vacuum tube (such as No. 81). T is the power transformer, and its function is to convert 110 or 220 AC to the required high voltage and low voltage to supply the plate and filament of the rectifier tube. In the figure, S is the high-voltage secondary coil, and S2 is the low-voltage secondary coil for lighting the filament. When the primary coil P is connected to the AC power supply, an induced current of the same frequency is generated in the secondary coil. Therefore, when the filament of the rectifier tube is hot, it can only allow the half-wave current of positive electrons to pass through the plate, while the half-wave current carrying negative electrons is rejected, thus forming the rectification effect. This kind of rectification only takes the half-wave of the AC, and the other half-wave is discarded, so it is called half-wave rectification. The current after rectification has a large tremor and is not easy to filter, so it must have a suitable filter to stabilize it.</p>
<p>Diagram 2</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 2, it is a full-wave rectifier circuit using a dual-plate vacuum tube (such as No. 80). I is the power transformer, which is the same as before, but the number of turns of the secondary high-voltage coil S should be doubled, and a center tap should be drawn in the middle. When the primary P is connected to the power supply, the secondary obtains an induced current of the same frequency. Therefore, at both ends of S, the positive and negative are opposite to each other in the same half-cycle, that is, the two plates are opposite in positive and negative in the same half-cycle. Assuming that in a certain half-cycle, one of the plates is positively charged, so there is current passing through, while the other plate has no current passing through because it is negatively charged (the principle is the same as half-wave rectification). By the second half-cycle, the positive and negative of the two plates are exchanged, and the plate that was positively charged before is negatively charged at this time and has no current passing through, while the plate that was negatively charged before is positively charged at this time and has current passing through. Therefore, the two plates work alternately to form full-wave rectification. The current after rectification does not have a large tremor. Because this kind of rectification uses every half-cycle of the voltage, its frequency change is more than doubled. Therefore, the filtering device can be simpler.</p>
<h3>Small Experiences</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>One method of adjusting a screen grid vacuum tube radio: When a new-style radio using a screen grid vacuum tube has the volume control turned to the minimum position, the tone is often not good. When listening to strong local radio stations, this kind of radio must greatly reduce the volume; otherwise, the sound will be too loud and unpleasant. However, after the volume is reduced, the tone will inevitably be rough, which has the disadvantage of taking care of one thing and losing another. If you want the tone to be harmonious and the volume not too loud at the same time, you only need to remove the cap on the first stage vacuum tube of the radio, and at the same time reduce the matching degree of the antenna circuit and the high-frequency stage. If this is done, the volume control can be turned to a moderate point to obtain a moderate volume and a harmonious tone. This adjustment method is simple and easy to implement, and does not cause any damage to the radio. If you want to listen to distant or small radio stations, you can restore the original style and then listen to it. (Note: After the cap on the vacuum tube is removed, it should be wrapped in paper to avoid contact with other parts of the machine and causing accidental loss.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Crisis</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>There are many ways to move a person's psychology, the most common is to move it with interests. When the lobbyists of ancient China were talking, they probably first had to talk about great disasters, so that the listeners felt that there was no way, and then they believed in his principles.</p>
<p>The remarks made by people from "Good Church" and "Tongshan Society" are mostly that the world has reached the "end of the world," and "soldiers, water, and fire are coming together." The foolish men and women listened to it and moved their hearts to worship their "first teacher" or "teacher." The Westerners who eat religious food are also mostly the same. In short, they rebuke ordinary people for being guilty, and repentance should come first. Or offer their bodies, or pay money, as atonement. Otherwise, there are devils in hell who will fork their souls. Many "feng shui masters" and "yin and yang families" in the inland let out a long sigh or a big laugh in people's graves or houses, followed by endless ghost stories, which must make the owner change color.</p>
<p>Those who advocate political struggles are also like this. The situation has become "acute" and the situation has become "tense." There are only two roads left, either to live or to follow me; or to die, not to follow me. ······ All of this is to get rid of people's bodies and souls. Even to the point that often there is only such a question left, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" 丨丨Yes and No will make people embarrassed to answer.</p>
<p>I can imagine Jesus throwing away a coin and saying···"Let Caesar's be Caesar's!" It was such a detached answer, but it was also slippery. In fact, it was because he had seen through this set of counter-plays early. In society, harming people is to carefully observe his path, and then arrange a kind of mechanism, so that he will be wrong to go to the right, and wrong to go to the left, both sides are unfavorable to him, and become a good Dilemmao. Without Jesus's courage, he would be harmed.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many situations deliberately created. If there is a "real" "crisis," "acute," or "tense," what will happen? The answer to this question is also easy. It is still an old thing. Not only is it unfavorable to both sides, but it is also unfavorable to many parties···A monk asked "seeking the Tao"···"What if you step forward three steps?" The answer is···"Head bumping!" ; "What if you step back three steps?" 丨丨"A fall of thousands of feet." "What if you don't advance or retreat?" 丨丨"Die on the spot!"</p>
<p>So what should I do? ···················</p>
<h3>Yunnan Tunes Picked Up</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>In western Yunnan, during May and June, it can probably be said to be the most romantic season. If you walk in the fields, you will always hear the songs飘floating from the bodies. Moreover, the songs sung by unfamiliar men and women to each other are always more numerous. For example, as soon as you hear a woman singing···"White cloth curtain, flowered pillow, where do you ask the young man to sleep?" Then the man will follow···"The young man has come a long way, so he will sleep with the little girl." It is said that a young couple, because they sang happily for a while, even fell in love, and then walked hand in hand to the forest behind the mountain, which also often happens.</p>
<p>However, here, I don't want to copy out these love songs, but I am happy to write down some of the jokes that tease each other···"When eating vegetables, you must eat the heart of the cabbage, and when raising a daughter, you must marry General Tang, it is so good to walk in front of people, and it is so good to call Mrs." The woman sang this to the man</p>
<h3>New Folk Rhymes</h3>
<p>— Xian Jie</p>
<p>Mountains in mountains, bays in bays, it is really difficult to be a human being now.</p>
<p>Although the harvest last year was good, the price of grain has fallen so much that it is difficult to keep warm. My family has seven mouths in total, and there are only five buckets of wheat left for the New Year. Old man Li in the front village was forced to be ill by the creditors. Second uncle next door pawned his daughter as a maid. How many men and women in the whole village are seeking a way to make a living in Shanghai. There is land in the mountains but no one to plant, and fields in the fields but no one to cultivate, and ghosts and gods are闹in front of and behind the village. Rather than saying that it shows her vanity, it is better to say that it is deliberately to make opponents of the village man class feel a little embarrassed. The man, immediately satirized···"When eating vegetables, you must eat the heart of the bitter vegetables, and when raising a daughter, don't marry General Tang, it is good to walk in front of people, but it is strangely difficult to call a slave."</p>
<p>As for the man singing···"Three elder sisters-in-law crossed the river, the one in the middle is my wife, the golden hairpin on her head was given by my brother, and the baby in her belly is mine." (哩, too.) If this is turned into a statement, it will not only be a big curse, but because it is in the singing, expressed through art, so the woman listening to it, not only is not angry, but will very cleverly answer···"Three elder sisters-in-law crossed the river, the one in the middle is your milk, the golden hairpin on her head was given by your grandfather, and the baby in her belly is your reincarnation."</p>
<h3>On Translation (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Om</p>
<p>Two, thoroughly study the original text. Understanding the original text and translating is better than "re-translating." Sometimes, it is necessary to understand it too sharply, and then feel that it cannot be translated and put down the pen, and then start to say that it can be translated. At this time, the translation is forced, the best translation, even to get it outside of the 特骊骊黄, then it will become an unprecedented discovery, and a better translation. Until the language is broken, and the mind is cut off, then save its "not translating", and only "transliterate". Master Xuanzang has five kinds of "not translating", which are quite far-sighted, listed as follows···</p>
<p>1. Because it is secret 丨丨 such as "陀罗尼".</p>
<p>2. Because it contains multiple meanings 丨丨 such as "薄伽梵" has six meanings.</p>
<p>3. Because there is no such thing here 丨丨 such as "阎浮树", there is no such tree in Middle-earth.</p>
<p>4. In order to follow the ancient 丨丨 such as "阿耨菩提", it is not impossible to translate, but the Sanskrit sound has always been preserved since Moteng.</p>
<p>5. For the sake of generating good 丨丨 such as "般若" respects "wisdom" is superficial.</p>
<p>Place names and people's names are of course better transliterated. Today's translation also implicitly fits this type. "Thames" is because it is secret; "humor" is because it has many meanings···"chocolate", "沙定" is because there is no such thing···"烟士披离纯" is to follow the ancient, "奥伏赫变" is for the sake of generating good. All of these are not translated, but they are better than being translated. For example, saying···"Brother just saw the London Thames." Then the listeners will be awed, no other, because it is mysterious. "烟士披···" is not impossible to translate, but "Master Yinbingshizhu" has already translated it as "烟士披···", and just follow his "烟士···". "奥伏······" is even more heavy, making people look at it with awe, sincerely afraid that their consciousness will be "奥伏···", no, will be "scared". It can be seen that it generates faith.</p>
<p>But mastering the original text is not just about getting its meaning, but about understanding the background of the original work.</p>
<p>The background is what the bureaucrats understand the most. To be an official, you must know who has a close relationship with whom, and who becomes a system with whom. The same is true for translation. For example, when translating famous philosophical works, you should know the system of thought of this philosopher and who influenced him. Or just like why the "superior" appreciates someone, then why the author wants to write such a book should also be clear. Translation like this can save energy. For example, when translating Western novels, the living background of Westerners should also be known. Russian tea sets are not like Chinese teapots; the priest's cross on the chest is not different from the monk's palms. For example, it is strange to sit in the "window" to drink tea or play chess, but I don't know that this window is not like a thin window in China, and can only sit "under the window" or "in front of the window". Of course, these are relatively rare examples.</p>
<p>In addition to the original text, it is better to know one or two other languages. You should also know one or two ancient languages, or Sanskrit, or Greek, or Latin; you should also know more than one or two modern languages, or English, German, French, Italian, and various languages. The cultures of the various European and Western nations influence each other.</p>
<p>With these two conditions, you can completely grasp the two languages, but there is a bigger condition, which is···(to be continued)</p>
<h3>Sketches of Peiping</h3>
<p>— Yao Ke</p>
<p>(3) Camels and others</p>
<p>Many years ago, I saw a set of colored landscape photos of Peiping, one of which was a team of lovely yellow camels along the majestic city wall. This impression has been in my heart for several years, because I have never seen a live camel, let alone a live camel walking on the edge of an ancient city.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Peiping, I passed through the city wall at the entrance of Zhengyangmen. I opened my eyes and looked around, hoping that a team of bright orange camels would run out, but unfortunately, I looked for a long time and didn't see a single camel shadow. But not long after, I finally saw it.</p>
<p>It was a cold morning, and the wind was blowing very hard. I came out of Dong'an Market, covered my mouth and nose with a handkerchief, and walked south along Wangfujing Street. Dust blew in my face, and I lowered my head and pulled the brim of my hat to my eyebrows, blocking my eyes. Suddenly my foot kicked a soft thing and almost tripped.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and saw that it was a yellowish, like a pile of dead grass. Ah! No! This is the camel I dreamed of, lying on the sidewalk!</p>
<p>There were six in total, and their large bodies almost filled the entire sidewalk. The small heads, small eyes, long and curved necks, and high-bulging peaks were almost the same as in the landscape photos. But the color of the hair was dry and yellow, and there was no luster at all; the hair on the buttocks, knees, flanks, etc. was all rubbed bald, revealing dark skin. A thick and black pad was tied on the back peak, and the whole body was dyed with coal and dust.</p>
<p>A few "coal ghosts" ran out of the coal yard, carrying sacks filled with coal blocks on the camel's backs, and the camel driver whistled. The six large animals obediently crawled up. The long legs and thick soft hooves slowly paced forward; the furry thick eyelids blinked their small eyes, unafraid of the wind and dust, but also without expression. Ah! How dull, how listless eyes!</p>
<p>This is definitely not the camel in the wind photo, right?</p>
<p>In addition to camels, there are also animals pulling cargo carts on the streets of Peiping, donkeys, horses, donkeys, and even sheep and dogs sometimes also help donkeys and horses pull carts in front of the carts. There are also donkeys and horses in Shanghai. The handsome horses in the racetrack and the tall donkeys used by the armies of various countries stationed in Shanghai can often be seen on the road. However, the donkeys and horses in Shanghai are handsome, and their fur shines brightly. Not only are the fur colors of the donkeys and horses in Peiping gray and faded, but even the arc of the spine is straightened and changed from its original shape. Their fate may not be as good as that of camels, right? ○ ○ ○</p>
<h3>Folk Song</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>I just passed by the street and heard a group of villagers singing. They pointed their fingers at the sun, treading on him, and sang in unison. ××××××××</p>
<p>Mentioning this song is really frightening, it once made a tyrant throw himself into a fire pit, today it comes really strangely, what kind of world is today?</p>
<h3>Confession in Response to He Jiahua's False Accusation</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>Since my confession was published, I have been hoping that Jiahua would make an honest statement to end this matter. But he was silent, and it wasn't until the 22nd that I saw his "confession" in this publication after a long period of design. However, this "confession" still does not match the facts, and Jiahua's attitude is still dishonest, just like his "past behavior was dishonest." In order to clarify the facts and ask Jiahua to seriously "reflect" again before talking about "new life," I will only expose the places where he falsely accused or spread rumors···</p>
<p>His "confession" can not only not be said to be sincere, it is simply like a villain's shyness turning into anger, and blood spurting. He said that I have "almost the same behavior" as him. This kind of Ah Q's despicable revenge means will be seen clearly by discerning people. However, he has pointed out and falsely accused me, so I have to declare one by one···</p>
<p>(1) The translated work "Nude Woman Under the Sun" published in the supplement of the Nanjing Central Daily News was a short story whose original text I read in college. Because I felt it was very good, I translated it casually, and that was my first translation attempt. Lacking confidence, I asked my classmate Zhou Guangxi to proofread it again. Jiahua knows this very well, but now he falsely accuses the original translator as Mr. Zhou, and falsely accuses me of replacing the name!</p>
<p>(2) The "University Prince" published in the Hangzhou Minguo Daily was indeed written by Fu Shanggao. At that time, I asked Mr. Fu to write for the publication. Although the article was obtained, because it was a game article, he was unwilling to publish it under his real name. So the two of them jokingly signed the name "Xu Chang." I have never admitted that I wrote it. Where have I ever published an article under the name "Xu Chang"?</p>
<p>(3) "He asked Peng Chenghui for two volumes of Mr. Wen Zichuan's essays, saying that he would send them to Central Park for publication." What does this mean? Said to send it, did it send it in the end? If it is sent, is it signed with Mr. Wen's name? Or sign my name? This point doesn't need to be said, because it was never sent at all.</p>
<p>(4) "He also asked Lou Zhiming and Chen Fuxi Gongjun for novels." But did they ask for it? How many articles did they ask for? Here I have to confess some facts···I once said to Mr. Lou, "You also give me one!" This joke was said. But I never said this to Mr. Chen at all. My friend Lou Zhiming (also a good friend of Jiahua) is a person who studies railway management at Jinan University. He doesn't often write novels. He only wrote a virgin work called "Scavenger", which has been printed in the Jinan school publication. However, Jiahua insisted on taking it as his own. The publication sent to other cities has been sent out, and there is no way to think about it. On the publications sent to this city, the place where Lou Zhiming's name was signed was printed with three red lead characters of He Jiahua, and then copied it once and published it in this month's issue of Shen Bao Monthly. When I knew Jiahua's situation, I was unhappy for Zhiming with my own unhappiness. Jiahua always抢夺robs the works of unknown friends, so in front of Jiahua and Zhiming, I said half angrily and half sarcastically···"Zhiming, you should also send me one!" Now I take this to excuse me and falsely accuse me. I think this kind of vicious revenge is mean and shameless!</p>
<p>I could have ignored these false accusations that damage my personal reputation and sued directly in court, but now I am declaring to the readers on the one hand, and preparing to file a lawsuit on the other hand.) To be continued (</p>
<h3>Last Words (8)</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Having said that, she bid him farewell.</p>
<p>Even the tram fare to get there had been taken from Li Ma. Now, having left Xi Zhuoyun's door, she didn't have a single copper coin on her. She didn't know how she'd managed to survive these past few days, because her financial resources had long since run dry. Now, it wasn't just that she couldn't get through the end of the year, but even in ordinary times, she couldn't cope.</p>
<p>Leaving Xi Zhuoyun's door, she walked slowly eastward along the tram tracks from the end of Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>"I just can't figure out Xi Zhuoyun," she thought, as if still trying to understand him. "Why did he have to play these tricks on me? He initially agreed to this and that, but in the end, he didn't even mention paying last month's稿費. And even at the very end, he said he would try to sell 'The Taste of Life' for me, although it wasn't certain to succeed, but why didn't he give me a call as he said he would? Now he says he's not at home, but is he really not at home? Does he think that if I saw him, I would cling to him? In fact, if it weren't for that last promise of his, would I even have gone to see him like this today? And if he had called as he said he would, I wouldn't have needed to see him at all. I really don't know why he has to keep playing these tricks! Maybe he's not intentionally playing tricks, but just being foolish, initially thinking he could handle everything, but in the end, he couldn't handle anything. And he doesn't dare to insist, fearing he'll offend his boss. He's just a coward!"</p>
<p>Thinking of that, she let out a long, deep sigh.</p>
<p>"But I've become a captive of that foolishness and cowardice," she continued to think. "Because of the entanglement with 'The Taste of Life,' I haven't written anything else last month or this month. How can I continue to survive?"</p>
<p>She then thought of suicide. Suicide had long been floating in her mind, but at this moment, it seemed to forcefully enter her thoughts with a stronger will. She thought it would be better to commit suicide, and now she was thinking about how she should do it. She hated this cruel society, and she wanted to give it a cruel revenge, or perhaps give it an even crueler satisfaction.</p>
<p>As for her mother, her younger siblings, she couldn't worry about them. She thought they would probably be able to take care of themselves, just as she was taking care of herself now. And if she committed suicide, she believed that "The Taste of Life" would definitely be published immediately. When news of a suicide victim just begins to ripple through society, a publication is already printing his posthumous work. How Sensational! And from the publication of "The Taste of Life," they could get a small inheritance. Or maybe some compassionate people would give them some consideration.</p>

<h3>Securities: May Government Bonds Debut</h3>
<p>丨Market Reaches Peak, Transactions Lively丨</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although the March futures had been settled and there was no risk of infighting, the sentiment in the market remained very good. The May futures made their initial debut, but only the "18 Customs" and "Jin Chang" issues were not opened for trading. The rest opened in the morning and were very lively, with prices also very firm and high, indicating strong demand. Issues like No. 4, 10, 20, 31, 35, and 79 were successively bought in each round, while sellers were mostly from No. 11, 15, 17, and 33. Based on this situation, prices are unlikely to fall anytime soon, and the bullish momentum is still strong. Compared to before settlement, except for the "19 Shan" and "96" issues, all others reached new highs. Salt tax also reached 67%, and although prices may continue to rise, the higher they go, the more dangerous it becomes. If the environment becomes unfavorable, the turbulence will be greater, and bulls should pay extra attention. Yesterday, the market opened well by 2-3角 in the morning. Although the May issue was the first to open, trading was very active. In the next round, the "Disbandment Bonds" rose sharply by half a yuan, and others also improved slightly by a few 角. However, the 20-year issues were somewhat flat and weak. The afternoon opening was also stable and firm, slightly better by 1-2 角. At the close, the "Disbandment Bonds" rose sharply again by half a yuan, and the rest also continued to improve by about 2-3 角. At these high prices, they continued to rise sharply, which could only be attributed to the financial sector buying in. Therefore, various prices, including 19, reached new highs again. The trend was that No. 38 stopped selling, and large investors were buying in, so there was no immediate drop in sight. As a result, prices continued to rise by 2-3 角 to 8-9 角. The total transaction volume was 14,711,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot transactions and 14,710,000 yuan in futures. The rise and fall results are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Gold Mining Stocks Reach Peak</h3>
<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday's New York stock market opened flat and firm. In the last hour, there was a possibility of U.S. currency inflation. The Senate overrode President Roosevelt's veto of the civil servant subsidy bill. Also, due to the upcoming holiday, short sellers covered their positions, and buying was unusually strong, causing prices to surge. Hoster gold mining stocks reached a new high of $388. Other gold mining stocks also set new records. The small exchange and commodities rose along with the stock market. Bonds were also slightly higher, with U.S. government bonds and high-grade bonds firm. Foreign government bonds saw mixed fluctuations. According to the agent's report, securities traders are becoming more optimistic with a good foundation. Wheat trading was very active, but buyers were unwilling to follow up. Reports from the Southwest and Northwest were bad, and it could be bought when it fell. Cotton was soaring because the Senate overrode the President's veto and the clamor for inflation was rising again. Also, because the Senate passed the amendment to the Bankhead Act, the case will be discussed and voted on by both houses, delaying it again. At the same time, the technical position of cotton is very good, so the rise became more intense. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,020,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Settlement Date Reveals Dullness</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained calm. Although American cotton rose, actual sales felt even more sluggish than the previous day. Prices were also flat. Futures yarn will continue until the end of the month to handle settlement matters and the market is closed for one day. Actual yarn transactions were less than yesterday. A survey of the total purchases by various firms throughout the day showed 320 bales were purchased. The market situation was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts by various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 215 Shantou 65 Guangdong 50</p>
<p>The cotton market remained flat. Although American cotton turned upward, the price of silver rose, resulting in a hidden drop in price, so sentiment softened. Actual cotton sales were extremely deserted. With yarn sales sluggish, there was basically no activity for raw materials. Only a portion of imported cotton rose. There is hope that tomorrow's marked cotton may rise. The supply totaled 174 bales of Tong cotton. Current cotton prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>Bird's-Eye View of This Month's Yarn Settlement</h3>
<p>Remaining 11,850 Bales</p>
<p>Settlement Price at 172 Yuan</p>
<p>The March marked yarn entered the market on October 2nd of last year at a price of 188 yuan. At this time, due to domestic bankruptcies, market depression, and commercial decline, yarn sales were sluggish and all sectors lacked purchasing power. The market showed increasingly unstable signs, and inventories grew thicker. Therefore, the market trended downward daily. Later, the Cotton Industry Control Association was established, and the He Xing Company was organized, initially purchasing and maintaining the marked yarn. For a time, the situation on the commercial market was tense, rising from 180 yuan to 87 yuan. Unexpectedly, military changes occurred in Fujian and Zhejiang, actual demand stagnated, and holders, seeing the unfavorable situation, collectively sold short in the standard market. The market broke through the 80 yuan mark directly, between 174-5 yuan. Subsequently, at the end of last year, with American cotton proponent, Mr. Bankhead, proposing reductions, the market price rose from 1角0 to 1角2分外. The yarn market rose due to the increase in raw cotton prices. At the same time, a certain manufacturer, aware of the suffering of expensive cotton and cheap yarn, bought heavily in the futures market, rising wildly by 5-6 yuan in two days, from 70 yuan to over 83 yuan. Extending into this month, the factory side, due to the low yarn price and sluggish sales, convened various factories to unite and maintain prices. Factories even discussed reducing work hours and prohibited the release of yarn from various factories into the exchange. At the time, the result was satisfactory and the market was quite stable. However, the inventory of yarn in the warehouse increased daily, which contradicted the actual situation, indicating that the intentions of the factory side were still difficult to unite consistently. Japanese merchants, seeing the unfavorable situation, sold off large quantities in the marked yarn market, thus triggering a huge selling trend. 15,000 bales of newly released yarn entered the exchange's warehouse. The manufacturer's intention to receive the goods had been firm, but under the pressure of active deliveries, they had to painfully give up the incoming amount. As a result, the falling trend intensified, dropping directly from 184 yuan to 170 yuan and 2 角, down 11 yuan from February's price. The changes in the March yarn market can be said to be huge. As a result, 11,850 bales remained, of which 1,300 bales were self-delivered. The goods included over 7,000 bales of 20-count Indian yarn, 1,200 yuan of Double Deer, 150 yuan of Five Blessings, over 1,000 bales of Bao Yi, and 3,000 bales of 20-count Fugui, 500 yuan of 10-count Fugui.

<h3>This Month's Marked Cotton Delivery Volume</h3>
<p>23,200担</p>
<p>Delivery Price 42 Yuan</p>
<p>The March marked cotton entered the market on October 2nd of last year, priced at 40 yuan 07 角5分. At that time, due to the domestic new cotton entering the market, uniform rainfall everywhere, good harvests, and also good harvests of American cotton, the market price trended lower. At one point, it broke through the 40 yuan mark, reaching a low of 39 yuan 2 角. Later, because the new cotton had too much moisture, the quality of the goods arriving in Shanghai was wet, and the delivery standard was particularly difficult, with many unqualified. Short covering pushed the market back up to over 40 yuan. Also, with American cotton proponent, Mr. Bankhead, proposing a reduction in planting and ginning, with a tax of 1角2分 per pound for amounts exceeding 10 million bales, American cotton rose from 1 角 to 1 角2分多, and the marked cotton also followed the rise, reaching a high of 44 yuan 7 角5分. Unexpectedly, with Indian cotton having daily increasing reserves and sluggish consumption, the market price was in the opposite proportion to American cotton. At the same time, the decline in the yarn market greatly affected the closely related cotton market. Actual cotton sales were bleak, so sentiment was weak, and the market turned downstream again. Extending into this month, although the American cotton Bankhead reduction plan had been passed, the labor unrest there was intense, and the market price fell instead. The marked cotton was also hit, and the lowest price was again seen at 41 yuan 6 角. As a result, 25,200 担 remained, of which 8,100 担 were self-delivered. The goods were all Shaanxi cotton, with a delivery price of 42 yuan. The bale amounts of both the receiving and delivery parties are listed separately as follows:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Rebounds by Over 20 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market saw bullish political news, strong Wall Street support, and active buying, resulting in a firm and lively market. Spot prices rose by 20 points, and futures prices rose by 22 to 26 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 13 points, nearby futures fell by 7 points, and distant futures rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 17 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to long covering, but then rose due to speculative buying. As a result, Pingal fell by 1 rupee 2 角5分, and Oomra and White Raw Creek both fell by 1 rupee and a half. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 29th):</p>

<h3>American Cotton Advances with Bankhead Act</h3>
<p>A report from New York on the 29th regarding the cotton market during the week stated that uncertainty over legislation and the Senate amendment to the Bankhead Act caused the market to be volatile. The market price fell at the beginning of the week due to long covering, increased supply in the South, and the widening price gap between the US and India, which triggered selling in Bombay. Later, the market recovered due to buying by industry peers and the possibility of currency inflation, and speculative support also rose. The authorities' attitude towards currency inflation remains unchanged. The Senate's passage of the Bankhead Act resulted in a rapid recovery in the market. However, the wording of the Act is still subject to determination by both houses of Congress. Actual demand is not high, supply is also thin, the cost basis is firm, and cotton goods remain sluggish. Scattered transactions are still good. Recent rainfall has delayed the planting of new cotton in many areas, but the lack of rain in the west has been relieved.</p>
<h3>Financial Banks' Receipts and Disbursements Are Minor</h3>
<p>Caused by Foreign Merchants Closing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the banks on the Bund were silent because foreign companies closed for the Western holiday, resulting in a complete lack of news. The foreign interbank rate in the market was slightly better by 1 point compared to the previous day, calculated at 5 points. The morning and afternoon markets were completely the same, and the white notes were even more loose than the previous day. The transaction of payment tickets in the morning market was over 430 yuan transferred, and over 200,000 yuan in new transactions. Transactions in the afternoon market totaled over 300,000 yuan, and transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 500,000 yuan. Foreign merchants followed the usual practice of closing, so there were no receipts and disbursements to count. Chinese banks also used to close in previous years, but this year they exceptionally remained open as usual. The receipts for ticket payments totaled over 1.2 million yuan, and various goods, foreign exchange deposits, taxes, and miscellaneous expenses totaled over 2.1 million yuan. Details of warehouse movements, settlement, receipts, and disbursements are unknown. Money shops' foreign public order receipts and disbursements were over 3.1 million yuan, foreign head note payments were over 1.5 million yuan, remittances from various routes were over 300,000 yuan, and foreign exchange deposit transactions were over 700,000 yuan. Regarding the inflow and outflow of banknotes, 700,000 yuan was recovered and 400,000 yuan was issued. 200,000 yuan came from customer routes and 150,000 yuan went to the stomach. Also, the total amount exchanged by the Shanghai Clearing House on the 30th was 8,600,000 yuan 00,293 yuan and 06 cents, including 3,541,968 yuan 6 角5分 in silver dollars and 5,058,324 yuan 4 角1分 in汇劃银元.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Silver Slightly Rises, Copper Coins Return to Length</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Jiangnan small foreign currency had no price fluctuations in the morning and afternoon markets, remaining at 833 yuan. The trading volume was 7,000 角 in the morning market and 6,000 角 in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign currency was flat in the morning market and slightly rose by 1 yuan in the afternoon market, with the morning market at 754 yuan 5 角 and the afternoon market at 755 yuan 5 角. The trading volume was 50,000 角 in the morning market and 20,000 角 in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose again by 1,500文, to 321,500文. The cost of the transactions was 10,100 yuan in foreign currency, equivalent to 32,471,500文 in copper coins.</p>
<h3>Grains and Flour's Nanyang Sales Slightly Move</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, the market for each month was initially flat and then stabilized. The quoted price for foreign wheat saw a rebound of around 2 角 in Chicago, while Canadian wheat remained unchanged. At the initial opening, there was little difference between the near and far terms. Subsequently, with transactions in the current month approaching the one-day transaction, the bulls still had to unwind, and the market was flat. The distant months were initially flat and soft, but later, with short covering, there was a slight rebound. By the time the afternoon market opened, transactions in the current month had stabilized, generally hovering around 7分. For the distant months, due to the Qingming Festival, the market will be closed for four days from the 2nd to the 5th. The factories held up April to prepare for withdrawals, so sentiment below May was quite good, and with Nanyang firms steadily buying in small amounts in recent days, sentiment was active again. As a result, the current month was slightly down by 2厘半, April was up by 7厘半, May was up by 1分7厘半, June was up by 1分2厘半, and July and August were up by 7厘半.</p>
<h3>Spring Cold Reduces Wheat Sellers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market largely presented a picture of hovering. Foreign wheat prices were up by 2 角 in Chicago, and Canadian wheat remained unchanged. There were no transactions in the near term in the morning and afternoon, and trading in the distant term was also light. Market fluctuations were not large, and because the weather was still阴寒, and the weather was inevitable to see changes, the number of sellers diminished. As a result, June and July were unchanged, and August was up by 1分. As for the spot wheat market, inventories in the market are still large, but factories are unwilling to act because market values are too high.</p>
<h3>Rice Sources Continuously Arrive, Market Sentiment Weakens</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, sources from various firms totaled over 80號 (over 12,000 石), of which late rice accounted for the majority, and thick粳 rice and other varieties accounted for a minority. The destination for late rice was no longer as strong as before, with only firms from Beiyang, Tianjin, Weiyang, and Wei participating, so the situation was inevitably slightly inferior. It is estimated that nearly 3,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other goods entered, but with the source from Laiyuan being too涌, a state of oversupply was still present, resulting in a large number of loads of each item being held. This was because customer intentions were relatively weak, the eating盘 was strict, and sellers tried to push sales, but felt thorny. Helplessly, they could only try to quickly unload. As a result, although Beiyang firms were uniquely able to make this number, the market could not avoid falling, and prices depreciated by 5-6分. On this street, in addition to late rice still being淡泊, thick粳 rice from various firms no longer tasted good, and the market was still difficult to invigorate. Fortunately, arrivals were scarce, and the current state could still be similar to before, but prices were参差不一. Although Duyang pointed rice was平 in supply and demand, the quality of the goods was not equal, resulting in different prices. With the exception of Bianyuan, sales were not widespread, the market turned soft, and prices fell by 角许.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 25-6 loads of various goods arrived from Hexia. The consumption of various colors in the market was normal. The market price of white粳 rice was slightly down by 2-3分. Various尖 and 阴元 were similar. Early rice and thin rice were also slightly down by 近角.</p>
<h3>Stagnation of Rice Sources in Hunan and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for客秈 rice (a type of rice) was as follows: due to the recent sluggishness in the north, the supply has decreased. Furthermore, warehouses in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces are storing rice, and there have also been military purchases recently. As a result, prices in both provinces are high, and transportation has been halted. The market sentiment is leaning towards higher prices. Additionally, the Fuzhou traders continued to buy actively, and inquiries came from Wenzhou in Zhejiang province and also from this street (Shanghai). The market immediately turned from sluggish to brisk. Middle-grade rice is welcomed by all parties, with prices increasing by nearly a 角. Other types of rice have risen by four or five 分. However, the traders in Tingzhou and Ganzhou provinces are holding onto their goods tightly, and the total transactions were less than 1,000 bags. The active trade continues to be in goods from Wuhu, Nanjing, Sha Shi, Wuxi, and Jiangbei. Because there are many shipments from the aforementioned locations, the traders are also eager to sell. The total amount of rice purchased by the Fuzhou traders was 6,071 bags, Wenzhou traders bought 1,269 bags, traders from this street (Shanghai) bought 500 bags, and there were also 250 bags of small lots returned. These small lots are small odd amounts, and the selling price is still the same as the previously quoted 6 元 7 角 5 分, which is higher than the selling price of whole lots.</p>
<h3>Vigorous Sales of Soybeans</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean sales were still brisk, with 8 carts of 頴州 beans, 5 carts of 南河 beans, 2 carts of 肥河 beans, 1 cart of 正陽關 beans, and 50 bags of 歸油 beans sold. The export trade was active with traders from Fuzhou and Xiamen, and inland traders from 德車家 were also purchasing. Sales in this street (Shanghai) were also strong. There was a slight increase in purchases by manufacturers. Yesterday, 11 carts of various beans were traded. In this weak market situation, the market color was still stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sees Dozens of Bags of Zhang Diaoqing Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market sentiment remained depressed as sales to various regions had not yet developed. The public association quoted prices such as 24 coarse grain sugar at 19 元 8 角 3 分, with over 100 bags traded, No. 8-9 嗬赤 sugar at 15 元 7 角 5 分, and No. 1 本廠 (local factory) refined sugar at 振記 18 元 5 角 and 仁記 18 元 4 角, with only sporadic sales. 太古 B mark was quoted at 20 元 0 角 2 分 5 厘, but no transactions occurred. On the quotation board, 建帮 quoted over 60 bags of 開漳刁青 sugar at a price of 10 元 0 角 9 分, and 雜牌 (various brands) Tonghu quoted over 40 bags of 茹紛潮 sugar at a price of 7 元 2 角.</p>
<h3>Prediction of Abundance and Scarcity of New Lychee and Longan Flower Seedlings from North and South</h3>
<p>According to letters from various firms in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Anhai, Tong'an and other places, the development of new lychee and longan flower seedlings this year is expected to be poor. The reason is that the frost and snow last winter were very heavy. Therefore, the aforementioned four places are likely to have only 30% of a normal harvest this year. As for Xinghua longan flower seedlings, Xianyou County was also affected by last year's frost and snow, so the harvest may be slightly reduced. However, it is said that Putian County was not affected, so a good harvest is still expected. In Qiongzhou, Haikou only had 10-20% of a normal harvest last year. It is reported that the seedlings are sprouting vigorously this year. If there are no unexpected events, it seems that 70-80% of a normal harvest is expected. In Zengcheng, Guangdong, the round and flat branches of longan are also expected to have a 50-60% harvest this year.</p>
<h3>Resurgence of Price Increases for Metals, Large Bars of 青鉛 (Lead)</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to news of rising prices overseas, lead merchants had excellent sentiment, and standard prices saw a resurgence of price increases. It is estimated that each 担 (担 is a unit of weight, using a 天平秤 (balance scale)) is worth 15 元, an increase of 角半 compared to before. However, public asking prices range from 15 元 2 角 to 3 角. Traders such as 黃丹廠 (litharge factory), 油漆公司 (paint company), and 茶樹幫 (tea tree group) are all buying in large quantities. However, traders from 客帮 are not buying foreign lead because they have bought too much 土鉛 (local lead) from Hunan.</p>
<h3>Japanese White Iron Sheets Fill the City</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese plain white iron sheets have once again filled the city. The local boycott sentiment has faded, and the number of patriotic people is few. As a result, unscrupulous merchants are very active, and the market for British and American white iron sheets has been greatly affected. Therefore, standard prices have been declining repeatedly. The recent market conditions for British, American, and Japanese goods are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>Flower Color          British Goods       American Goods       Japanese Goods</p>

<h3>No One Inquires About Silk and Tea Overseas</h3>
<p>▲Shanghai Silk Factories in Perilous Situation: Due to slow sales of silk fabrics, European and American silk weaving associations are shortening work hours and reducing production, resulting in a sharp decline in the consumption of raw silk. Furthermore, Japanese silk is being dumped at excessively low prices. As a result, the market price of Chinese silk has fallen drastically again and again. Ordinary Shanghai white factory silk has fallen to 450-460 元 in New York and 520-530 元 in Lyon, and there are still few inquiries. Shanghai silk factories are in a perilous situation. There is a large stock of silk, but no one is asking about it. Most of it is mortgaged to the financial sector. The new silkworm cocoons from Zhejiang province are about to enter the market, but there is no capital to purchase them. All funds have been lost. Soon, the deadline for the silk cocoon mortgage loans will arrive, and there will be no money to repay them. Bankruptcy is inevitable. Of the 113 silk factories in Shanghai, only seven, including Yongheng, are勉强(barely) operating, and they are all entrusted by the financial sector to reel silk for the mortgaged cocoons. Once the silk is reeled, they will shut down.</p>
<p>▲Despair in Foreign Silk Sales: Japanese silk dumping in European and American markets is intensifying, and silk prices are falling drastically step by step. No one is asking about Chinese silk. Yesterday, only British and French firms took advantage of the low prices to replenish their factory stock of second-grade silk due to a shortage of 灰经 (grey silk). Renji and other companies bought 20 bales of white factory silk and 5 bales of grey silk, but prices continue to decline.</p>

<h3>Destroying Modernity</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>In a certain newspaper on the 27th of this month, there suddenly appeared an eye-catching blood-red woodcut headline: "Destroying Modernity!" Above it were two small titles in extra-large lead type: "Strange Group," "Over a Thousand Pieces of Western Suits and Flashy Clothes Destroyed." I hurriedly picked up the newspaper and opened it, which couldn't help making me feel a little terrified! The article said: "Hangzhou, 26th dispatch: A 'Modernity Destruction Iron Blood Group' has been discovered in Hangzhou. Activities began on the evening of the 25th, using strong acid to secretly spray men's Western suits and women's flashy clothes in various entertainment venues. On the evening of the 26th, newspapers received a declaration from the group, stating that they were promoting national products and destroying modernity, and that their activities had resulted in the destruction of over a thousand pieces of modern clothing. Society is greatly shocked, it is said..." From this news item, I have gained two impressions: (1) In today's society, everything is becoming increasingly vain, especially in bustling and prosperous cities, where people admire extravagant habits. Therefore, the term "modern," "modernity," has become a common catchphrase among fashionable people. However, when we interpret the meaning of the word "modern," it is a Western translation of "contemporary" or "recent." However, in recent years, almost all of our country's young people have become very familiar with these two words. This shows that our people are so deeply poisoned that it is beyond salvation!</p>
<p>Originally, there are many upper-class Chinese, bourgeois people. Although it is said that China is poor, I don't believe that those poor people are all damned wretches. One garment costs a hundred gold, one meal costs ten gold—what's so rare about that? They really haven't seen the world. Moreover, in recent years, European influence has been increasing in our country, which has enlightened our stubborn minds that have persisted for thousands of years, and we have gradually come to understand civilization. All civilized people should live comfortably, use foreign goods extensively, and despise national products. Otherwise, they would have to wear the title of a "modern traitor," which is so shameful! Therefore, no matter how loudly the voice of promoting national products is shouted, they still desperately promote foreign goods, live in foreign houses, eat foreign food, wear foreign clothes, and use foreign goods. These modern people in the foreign concessions cannot do without any of these modern tasks. Recently, the appearance of this "Modernity Destruction Iron Blood Group" in Hangzhou is rather sudden and spoils the scene.</p>
<p>(2) But I must turn the topic around. This kind of behavior is ultimately illegal and immoral. Secretly destroying someone's good clothes—what a cruel act! Although they are obsessed with modernity and deserve punishment, it seems that this can also serve as a warning to them; however, their actions do not feel very honorable, and in the future, it will inevitably arouse great resentment and have a considerable impact on social order.</p>
<p>Currently, various inland areas and cities are promoting the New Life Movement. The essence of this New Life Movement is nothing more than to encourage people from all walks of life to unite and advocate frugality and respect for morality. The concept of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame has been highly valued in our country for thousands of years. Nowadays, people's hearts are not as they used to be, and social customs are deteriorating, so morality has declined and a sense of shame has been lost. When we see this situation, we wonder what kind of world it will become in the future. Therefore, we have no choice but to revisit old accounts and revive old plays, hoping to find a way to save this declining social custom. Then, we should all implement this New Life Movement in simple clothing and food, without any doubt. Moreover, the current social depression has reached such a point: "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, there are frozen bodies!" How can we bear to eat and use extravagantly? Some people have no food to eat, and cannot even swallow coarse sugar; some have no money to use, and suffer from copper coin fatigue. Why should I go against money and squander it without any explanation! Therefore, my opinion is: on the one hand, we do not need this kind of illegal "strange group," to avoid disrupting social stability; on the other hand, we should hope that those who are obsessed with modernity will quickly wake up, cherish themselves, and not just embrace vanity.</p>
<h3>A Living Abbreviation</h3>
<p>— Liehuo</p>
<p>|| For a Long Gown ||</p>
<p>This is a humorous little matter.</p>
<p>Although I am tall, I am not considered large. However, when it comes to making clothes, there are always problems. To put it bluntly, I have never worn a well-fitting garment. Every time I buy enough fabric, it turns out to be ill-fitting.</p>
<p>I have considered this issue myself, consulted others, and observed people. With my size, buying enough 1.3 zhang (approximately 4.3 meters) of fabric should be enough to make a large enough garment.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>However, that is not the case. When the garment is made, it is always as tight as a "cowhide drum," tightly bound.</p>
<p>Having learned a lesson once, I should be careful the second time and add a few inches to compensate for the shortfall. But when I get to the second, third, and even now, when buying fabric, I never take this into account. When the shop assistant asks how much I want to buy, I say that 1.3 zhang should be enough, right? The assistant agrees, so when I get the garment made and wear it, it is always too small.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to environmental factors, there is always a plan when making clothes, especially long gowns.</p>
<p>For example, in the cool weather of March or April, I would go to the Sanyou Industrial Society to make a single layer gown. To be honest, wearing a single layer gown at this time is very fitting. However, after the autumn coolness, wearing a lined gown still does not feel warm enough, but wearing a cotton gown is still too early. So, I would wear the single layer gown over it, which inevitably would be too tight. When winter comes, I would take out the quilted cotton gown. In theory, I should make a new outer gown, but there are some unspeakable difficulties, so I would wear the single layer gown over it again, making it even smaller.</p>
<p>In short, this situation is due to money. If I could make whatever clothes I wanted without those extra considerations, this layering of garments could be avoided at any time.</p>
<p>It was two weeks ago when I went to a certain company for the first time to have a long gown made. The weather was still cold. Although even athletes with strong physiques had already taken off their fur coats and put on light clothes, I was still wearing a shabby sheepskin coat. And over the sheepskin coat, I was wearing a single layer long gown, which looked particularly tight. Walking in, I chose a soft wool fabric at two jiao eight fen per chi. I asked the assistant, if I bought the fabric and hired a tailor, measuring 1.3 zhang, it would cost three yuan six jiao four fen in silver dollars. I touched the fabric, tilted my head, and measured it for a while, feeling that it was not cost-effective. I hesitated about not buying it, but that was not an option either, and I was very embarrassed. Somehow, I asked, "Can I have it made here?" The assistant replied, "Yes!" "How much will it cost to have it made?" "Three yuan five jiao per piece!" "Isn't that much better?" "Yes, yes!" "Then I'll have it made!" So they started measuring my size. I was afraid that it would be too small again, so I kept saying, make it a little bigger than the sheepskin coat, two inches longer and one inch wider. The assistant didn't say anything and measured me accordingly.</p>
<p>I walked out of the company feeling relieved, thinking that this time it wouldn't be too small!</p>
<p>Last week, I picked it up and tried it on, feeling relieved that it was not small. In fact, it was too big, so long that it touched the ground, and so wide that it looked like a Buddhist robe. But I still felt satisfied.</p>
<p>What was annoying were some friends who, when they saw me, either called me a monk or said that I had become a famous scholar. The only reason was that I was wearing such a large long gown.</p>
<p>So, I had to take it back to be altered.</p>
<p>Here, there is a philosophical path. When having clothes made, I am not afraid that there won't be enough material, but I hope that it will be made wider, which leads me to make such mistakes.</p>
<p>In short, this situation is also due to money.</p>
<p>If I could make one piece at a time, without this piece being worn over that piece, and that piece being worn under this piece, these troubles and dissatisfactions could all be avoided. From this, I thought of many things in my life over the years, all like making a long gown. Written hastily on the evening of the 27th. (The End)</p>

<p>— Chen Jingsheng</p>
<p>The traitor killed the children's mother. The traitor defies heaven's conscience, for the sake of hunger and stupidity.</p>
<h3>After Illness</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, the oily green grass, soft and verdant, covers the ground. The tree branches are lush, with tender buds sprouting. All the scenery remains the same, revolving into a beautiful, still familiar spring.</p>
<p>She lies at home all day, sick. In a small room, when no one comes, in that quiet time, she stops all the wheezing, uses all her strength, and slowly walks down from the bed that she has not left for days. She drags on two old, worn, brown slippers, and walks to the center of the room, not far from the bed, in front of a full-length mirror hanging on the wall, which is said to be the most beautiful piece in the room. She feels that she has lost weight, much different from the photos she took on stage before.</p>
<p>"Ah! How did my illness make my body like this?" She takes a long breath, seemingly blaming herself for her illness, which was caused by her own carelessness.</p>
<p>Looking at the clock, it is already 1:15 PM, the time when she usually wakes up from her afternoon nap. She also feels that her head is a little heavy, and she feels cold from time to time.</p>
<p>"Why not go outside for a walk!?" Struggling, enduring her sick body, she goes outside to get some fresh air. Perhaps because of this, she might be lucky enough to get some fresh air, and maybe her illness will return to its original state..." She mumbles to herself, as if with endless confidence, making a slight sound.</p>
<p>Although it has just passed the cold winter, and the weather is not that good, suddenly, a gust of wind fiercely carries sand and brushes past her ears. She seems to feel a kind of unspeakable oppression, which her thin and weak body cannot bear!</p>
<p>She gradually walks along a road, turns a corner, and feels a newly entered comfort rising in her chest. This feeling may be common in her sick body, a strange symptom of the disease - sometimes comfortable and sometimes sad.</p>
<p>A car, with its engine running at full power, drives past her. When her weak body has not yet recovered, she seems to feel that the car is like a wild beast, pouncing on her, causing her to feel a terrible fear! A light breeze gently stirs her clothes, fluttering them back and forth.</p>
<p>"Where to go!?" She silently buries her head and contemplates.</p>
<p>It has been so long since her illness. Time is ruthlessly galloping and disappearing as usual. A large group of friends seems to have disappeared with time. All the news and addresses of her friends, in her forgetful mind after her illness, have no memory at all!</p>
<p>The trees on both sides of the road are more beautiful than before, arranged neatly. From bud to bud of tender shoots, green leaves grow and hang on the branches and treetops. The fragrance of wild grass fills her nose; the spring sun makes people feel tired, and with the smell of gasoline from the cars passing on the road, it is even more difficult to smell and makes her want to vomit!</p>
<p>Wandering aimlessly like this, she seems to be somewhat bewildered after all. The ordinary road does not arouse much interest in her. For months, the various bizarre goods have not been piled up as colorfully as before, and they are much more deserted.</p>
<p>At dusk, the blue sky is hung on both sides with a blood-red setting sun that seems to have lost its elasticity. The pedestrians on the roadside gradually decrease and then disappear. Pairs of modern men and women, with the fatigue of a spring outing and some remaining sweat, are all turning back. At this time, bored and helpless, she still walks slowly with a heavy heart, as if she had been whipped many times, and returned home.</p>

<h3>Going to Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Liu Na</p>
<p>The idea of "going to Nanjing" has been floating around in my brain for the past few years for no less than ten million times.</p>
<p>Recently, the thought of going to Nanjing has become even more intense. It can be said that it has reached the boiling point, and the factual aspects are also completely correct. Everything is prepared. The only economic panic has been resolved by pawning my leather coat for travel expenses, which is only worth a little money. I have also made an appointment with a friend, fearing loneliness on the journey. I have thought of everything very carefully, and I am waiting for a car to the station tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>At this moment, how happy I am, my heart is almost screaming out loud. Dear people! Please spread your arms! Soon, I will come to you.</p>
<p>Childhood memories, scene after scene, are projected in my eyes. In Beijing opera, we often see those classical old-fashioned houses with half-open eight-character doors, revealing an old servant with a smiling face and a very respectful attitude, happily reporting to the owner inside. Then, my grandmother calls out "Baobao" and asks about everything with a loving tone.</p>
<p>What do you want to eat? Ah! Don't you like soup very much? I know very well that you especially like to eat lean pork stewed with ham soup. I will tell the kitchen to make it quickly. My aunts, uncles, and cousins surround me, reading and laughing. My younger cousins run to me, making noise, pulling my hands and clothes, wanting candy. Cousins of similar ages never want to separate, talking to each other, without any hidden thoughts. The best of friends among those distant relatives talk about everything when they are together, with no hidden thoughts.</p>
<p>After eight years of drifting, everything is no longer the same as before, and everything is no longer so simple. But not long ago, my mother, whom I had not seen for eight years, said that my elderly grandmother had already passed away. My aunts, uncles, and cousins are approaching middle age, and due to changes in circumstances, no trace of a smile can be found on their lips. My younger cousins have all entered middle school and are no longer as playful, lively, and innocent as before. When I see you, they will still be shy and lower their heads, unwilling to call auntie. My cousins have either gotten engaged or married. As for my close friends of the same age, some of them already have a large group of children. After she finished this passage, she sighed deeply, as if she had some feelings for me.</p>
<p>Now, the money from the pawned leather coat, the daily meals and living expenses, changing banknotes for silver dollars, silver dollars for dimes, dimes for copper coins, are gradually being used up bit by bit. "Go to Nanjing," "Go to Nanjing," has become a catchphrase, but until now, I have not moved my nest. Friends ask me about it from time to time, and I still answer them with one sentence: "Go to Nanjing."</p>

<h3>Starting with Venereal Disease: A Discussion</h3>
<p>Since the last publication of Mr. Zhong Guren's letter, in these two or three days, many readers have sent letters expressing their views on this issue, some blaming society, and others blaming the patients themselves. Now, we have selected two articles to publish here. The editor also has his own opinion, but at this time, he is not very confident. However, he sincerely hopes that readers will offer more opinions... I am shamelessly saying that I hope to gather everyone's wisdom and reach a more practical conclusion that can reduce some of the crises for young people! Editor's Note</p>
<p>Editor, I read Mr. Zhong Guren's letter yesterday, as well as the two questions raised by the editor... that is, "Is this crisis 'the fault of the patient or of society'?" I will humbly offer a small opinion for readers to study. I believe that this crisis is the fault of society, not the patient. Because sexual desire is innate and cannot be stopped. The ancients said, "Food and sex are human nature." The ancients regarded sex as important as food, so satisfying sexual desire is essential for everyone. However, how can Shanghai society allow you to satisfy your sexual desire? The cost of living is so high, the rent is so expensive, and there are so many people working, they are under economic pressure and cannot form small families in Shanghai. Therefore, when they feel the extreme temptation of sex, they can only seek pleasure in brothels as a place to satisfy their desires. Although they know it is dangerous, how can they resist the burning in their hearts? Moreover, people are always hoping for luck. If they don't encounter poison once, they will think they have nothing to worry about next time. So-called morality, punishment, and danger can only make them fear and stop them temporarily, but cannot prevent them from venting permanently. Therefore, unless prostitution is eradicated, leaving people with nowhere to go, this danger cannot be avoided. But this method is impossible... Even if official prostitution is banned, private prostitution will still be unavoidable. Only by asking the authorities to set up a special inspection bureau to give injections and inspections every day can they be allowed to operate. Besides this, I am afraid there is no better way?</p>

<h3>Hot Wind (7)</h3>
<p>— Cai Tonghua</p>
<p>"Damn it, making a fortune like this!" A Xing also hated.</p>
<p>People felt sympathetic anger and stood up for Uncle Shunxing. Uncle Feng couldn't see Mr. Yunfu's hiring practices. He licked his dry lower lip with the tip of his tongue, swallowing mouthfuls of saliva. "Trouble comes from the mouth, be careful in everything. Money is blood and sweat, I've seen enough of it."</p>
<p>"This is still the world!"</p>
<p>"Being a human is worse than being a dog!"</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>"Chih chih... Sha sha..." The sound of hurried footsteps, like the pace of marching soldiers, a heart-palpitating pace, came from afar, breaking the silence of the night. The sleeping village dogs jumped up and barked wildly. This house responded to that house, and all the dogs in the village were barking at the top of their lungs. The nightingale also woke up from the treetop and cried sadly. This mixed uproar trampled into the hearts of everyone in the village. People sharpened their drowsy ears and listened intently to the sudden noise outside.</p>
<p>"Chih chih... Sha sha..." clearer and louder.</p>
<p>"Woo woo... woo woo..." The restless screams made people know immediately that they were struggling in terror. At this time, there were also children howling as they woke up from their dreams.</p>
<p>"What is it?" This sudden change made A Xing unable to figure it out. He anxiously pressed his face to the door seam to look outside, but saw nothing. It was pitch black, only the terrible sound was getting closer and louder. A Xing bit his lower lip and tightly frowned. His mother trembled like in the cold night of winter, her teeth clattering against each other. She knelt on the ground, pouting her mouth and trembling her voice. His sister, on the other hand, was in a daze. Her dull gray eyes, like begging for help, stared at her brother and mother.</p>
<p>"Beng beng... beng beng beng..." mixed with shouts of "Oh my God..." and cries.</p>
<p>"Bodhisattva... protect... protect... the earth... the earth..." The mother tried her best to support her body and rummaged around. Then the cloth scraps in the cloth bag fell on the ground, and the glass vase rolled to the ground and broke. If it were another time, the mother would scold herself and pick it up with regret, waiting for the scrap collector to come. Now, she just looked around like a little thief, searching and picking.</p>

<p>Chinese Movies</p>
<h3>Has It Stopped Due to Environmental Pressure?</h3>
<p>— Thin Man</p>
<p>Chinese movies are currently facing a very serious difficulty.</p>
<p>Like other situations, Chinese movies are progressing with the progress of society. The objective conditions of society determine everything and determine Chinese movies. However, this progress has suddenly stopped recently. Society is still moving forward continuously, but movies have stopped. What a tragic thing this is.</p>
<p>The rise of Chinese movies is only a matter of the last ten years or so. Ten years ago, Chinese movies were just starting, and what they showed were just stories of old-fashioned young masters or feudal lessons. Or, they would just copy the leftovers of some foreign, especially American, movies, and show some immature and deformed things. This is the first period of Chinese movies.</p>
<p>At the end of the first period, just when the Chinese countryside was extremely bankrupt, warlords, bureaucrats, exorbitant taxes, miscellaneous taxes, military disasters, floods, droughts, etc., and all the economic networks of international imperialism were extremely exploiting the Chinese countryside. The general public was trapped in extreme poverty, tossing and turning and crying out, with no way out. Due to the lessons of feudal history over the generations, they knew that only the chivalrous and heroic actions of a few people could slightly break the status quo. So, heroes and righteous men like the Seven Heroes and Five Gallants and the Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes were all brought to the silver screen. This period can be said to be the second period of Chinese movies.</p>
<p>After this extremely decadent and reactionary period, Chinese movies had a glimmer of new hope. This is that Chinese movies gradually moved from an extremely decadent and reactionary period to another new era. This era not only completely got rid of the previous feudal stench, but also completely got rid of the previous deformed urban sordid form, surpassing the current declining social civilization and approaching a newer society. After this transformation, Chinese movies truly began to step into the realm of booming. This can be said to be the third period.</p>
<p>Naturally, this transformation of Chinese movies did not come out of thin air, but was determined by certain social objective conditions. This social objective condition is that after the changes in Chinese society over the past twenty years or so, the general public has gradually moved from vague sorrow and indignation to active efforts and struggles. Passive concession and blind attacks are no longer applicable. The lessons of history have made them know how to more clearly understand society and more correctly take effective and powerful measures to fight against the objective environment. All of this has made Chinese movies, in the most recent period, have to respond to the objective needs of society and make a great leap forward from the abyss of corruption and decline.</p>
<p>The above is the process of Chinese movies from the beginning to the development in the last ten years. From this process, we can know how Chinese movies have arisen and prospered in response to the objective needs of society. Society is constantly moving forward, and movies are also constantly moving forward; the objective conditions of society determine everything, and we can understand this situation without any doubt.</p>
<p>Then, will Chinese movies continue to move forward with accelerated steps in the future? Of course, this is an inevitable conclusion. But now, Chinese movies have experienced a sudden stagnation that has never happened before. This phenomenon shows that Chinese movies have changed from being full of content and powerful to being extremely empty and trivial. If you don't believe it, just watch a few recently released Chinese movies in a row and compare them with the works that were just transformed in content and style not long ago, and you will get an extremely dissatisfied feeling. Why is this? Chinese movies are obviously on the path to stagnation due to some special reasons.</p>
<p>So, where is the future of Chinese movies? The reason why Chinese movies can compete with foreign movies is entirely due to the fact that their content is full and can grasp the core of Chinese society; but now they don't have this point at all. What kind of substantive contribution will Chinese movies make to the general audience in the future? Foreign movies, especially American movies, although they are corrupt and declining, they still have great scenery to sell, and they still have prosperity and excitement to sell. What do Chinese movies sell? This is a serious question worth discussing.</p>

<h3>Review of "Idyllic Scenery"</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>SonofASailor丨Nanjing丨</p>
<p>Although "Idyllic Scenery" is a play in which a sailor single-handedly plays the protagonist and describes the life of sailors in many ways, it does not expose the reality of sailors' lives as we imagined.</p>
<p>No matter how different the drifting life of sailors at sea is from the life in the barracks, because modern countries need huge armies to maintain the dominance of the middle class, and they try their best to create a so-called "discipline" built on ignorance and slave mentality, but they neglect the improvement of soldiers' lives. As a result, in the armies of middle-class countries, sexual distress is widely developed among the vast masses of soldiers at the bottom. This can be used to explain why soldiers who have lost their control always violently demand the satisfaction of sexual desire.</p>
<p>This kind of distress is also revealed in daily life anytime and anywhere. "Idyllic Scenery" used humor and ridicule to describe this kind of distress of soldiers. However, first, it only made the audience laugh. At most, it ridiculed some soldiers who did not have the talent to "hunt for beauty." It never mentioned the soldiers' sexual distress, let alone the origin of this distress, let alone the new life of soldiers. Even the little bit of soldiers' sexual distress that "Idyllic Scenery" is currently writing is completely distorted by humor and what "romantic encounters."</p>
<p>The personality of the protagonist, Hansen, is fond of exaggerating and is resourceful. For example, during his boxing match, although he failed, he was still unwilling to give in, but he knew that he could not defeat his opponent, so he finally cheated to win. Also, exaggerating his love history, exaggerating his honor at Helen's house, etc., and many other trivial places can show his personality. This is the result of the actor Joe Ebb's influence. However, from the perspective of the overall work, many performances are too excessive and chaotic. Really, if "Idyllic Scenery" is a bad work full of meaningless chaotic scenes, it is not an exaggeration at all.</p>
<p>We must also point out that Hansen's heroic concept, romantic encounters, and the mobilization of that war at the end are completely coordinated.</p>
<p>The middle class raises a huge army, and because of the war demands of international capitalism, they cultivate purely imaginary heroic concepts in their soldiers, and use what "romantic encounters" to beautify the oppressed lives of soldiers, and drag the soldiers' thoughts into the mud pit of heroic concepts.</p>
<p>The climax of "Idyllic Scenery" used planes flipping in the air and the danger of being bombed to achieve the purpose of extremely stimulating the audience; the photography aspect is also quite remarkable.</p>
<h3>Review of "Physical Fitness" · Ling He ·</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Search For Beauty丨Da Guangming</p>
<p>I don't understand whether such a movie should be called a sports movie? But this movie is indeed based on sports.</p>
<p>When the playwright wants to put forward the so-called physical fitness in the movie and wants to justify himself, he must first criticize the current unreasonable situation of booksellers and merchants using sports as a gimmick to profit from it. Regarding this point, we do not neglect the commercialization of any thing in the current society. This is a characteristic of capitalist society. Picture book merchants invite athletes from the World Games to be editors, which is the best way to attract readers. Furthermore, publishing nude photos or obscene texts is common and unsurprising nowadays. Perhaps we can hear many moralists shaking their heads and sighing, lamenting the declining moral standards. But this raises the point that young men and women should cheer themselves up and not be exploited by unscrupulous merchants. The playwright believes that what should be promoted is the construction of gymnasiums, and that it should be grandiosely argued that sports should be popularized.</p>
<p>What we should pay attention to here is the true meaning of sports. Needless to say, sports meets or football star games must sell tickets and bet on winning or losing like jai alai or horse racing and dog racing, which proves the so-called capitalization of sports, and athletes are just disguised commodities. The promotion of sports by modern countries or the use of huge sums of money to support the lives of a small number of athletes has its political anesthetic effect. Therefore, we believe that the so-called real sports is definitely not to take money from us to create a few hero athletes, but to make the vast masses (including women and children) receive sports training. Therefore, we will never oppose the popularization of sports.</p>
<p>Wrong, the author of "Physical Fitness" uses "the popularization of sports" as an excuse. But what we see in the movie is that the author's ideology is to prevent gentlemen and ladies from envying the healthy bodies of athletes in vain, especially opposing flesh-sensing dancing, and to teach them or her to also receive sports training and live a so-called disciplined life. Is this the so-called popularization of sports? As for beautifying group exercises into dance scenes, although this is a movie trick, the playwright imagines it in the gymnasium, and I don't know how it should be interpreted?</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the playwright will not deny the commercialization of sports, and the gymnasium is nothing more than an advanced business store. Here, the author's ideological contradictions are fully unfolded. No, perhaps this is not a contradiction. He opposed the use of female athletes' bodies as magazine materials in the front, but it was just to further commercialize sports.</p>
<p>Now, it is a really strange world. Smart people often attack a certain unreasonable phenomenon on the one hand, while praising this phenomenon on the other hand to make it a beneficial thing for themselves, and live in this contradiction. Paramount itself is a very good example. Isn't it as ridiculous to spend a lot of money to hire swimming athletes from the World Games as movie actors as it is to invite athletes to be editors of sports magazines?</p>
<p>I think the above is definitely not meaningless gossip. Now, let's talk about some technical aspects. Regarding this point, we are not exaggerating at all to say that it is not surprising to have this result in American movies. Like other American movies, there are light-hearted dialogues, rigid gimmicks, charming dances, and grand opera scenes. It makes you laugh, it makes you happy, but it is just an entertaining and empty work.</p>
<h3>Top Ten Blockbusters of Hollywood in 1933</h3>
<p>— Shi Heqin</p>
<p>When Hollywood starts every new year, in addition to enthusiastically electing the top ten stars, there is also one thing, which is to elect the top ten blockbusters. The grand occasion is no less than the election of the top ten stars. Moreover, because major film companies there produce a lot, they produce no less than thousands of films in a year. In so many films, selecting ten films, their value can be imagined.</p>
<p>The top ten blockbusters of last year, under precise elections, have recently been published in the Hollywood Movie Daily. The top ten blockbusters that were elected are "Cavalcade," "42nd Street," "The Private Life of Henry VIII," "State Fair," "Maedchen in Uniform," "Farewell to Arms," "She Done Him No Wrong," (The above seven blockbusters have all been shown in Shanghai, and there are three more that have not been shown in Shanghai, so there is no translation name, and I have to write their English names below.) Lady For a Day, I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, Rasputin in the Empress. In these ten movies, most of them are performed by all the stars, such as "Cavalcade," "42nd Street," and "State Fair." The most rare thing is that the movies starring three new stars are also included in the top ten blockbusters. One is "The Private Life of Henry VIII" starring Charles Laughton, one is "Female Light" starring Dorothy Vicks, and the other is "Hell Angel" starring Mae West. It is impossible not to admire the fact that Hollywood has so many talented actors that newcomers can have such outstanding works!</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing is that Rasputin, a film co-starring the Barrymore brothers and sisters, has been shipped to Shanghai, but it was banned by the concession authorities, and it could not meet the people at sea on the screen. This is very regrettable.</p>

<h3>Carolina (8)</h3>
<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Robert left, and Will said... "Poor old man, simply suffering while alive... He is already a ruined body..." Joanna sobbed softly. What happened that night was really too difficult for her. Will hugged her and sent her home. They walked without saying a word. Will himself was too confused, because Virginia had told him a lot about how to organize the place. Of course, restoring the family business and restoring the old view is a very gratifying thing, but what about Joanna? He looked down at her, that kind of virginal mysterious beauty, had been imprinted in the deepest part of his heart. Joanna arrived at the door of the small farmhouse, and she shyly said good night to Will. Will suddenly hugged her and said... "Joanna, baby, I love you. The first thing I want to do tomorrow morning is to come here. Okay? Do you love me?" Joanna's heart was beating violently, and she said softly... "I like you very much." Will said... "Why don't you say you love me?" Joanna said... "It's not time yet, please don't force me." Will had no choice but to let her go, and agreed with her to come early tomorrow morning, and let her go in.</p>
<p>Joanna walked into the house, and Will listened to the sound of her quick footsteps going upstairs. He suddenly couldn't help himself, he felt he had to see her again. He shouted outside the house... "Joanna!" Joanna opened a window upstairs and stuck her head out and told him not to make a sound, lest he wake up her younger brother. There was a big tree in front of the house, and Will shrugged and jumped onto the tree and climbed up. Joanna gasped and asked in a very scared manner... "What are you doing?" But Will had already climbed outside Joanna's window. One of them was on the branch and the other was sitting on the window sill, and the two hugged and kissed. Will was constantly telling her his love. Joanna fell into his arms, closed her eyes, as if the moonlight was shining on her eyes, making them unable to open, and as if the fragrance of flowers floating up from the garden, making her drunk. Will told her to say that she loved him, and she said that she loved him, and hooked her arms around Will's neck, and kissed him deeply... kissing him.</p>
<p>Will got up early the next morning. He went to find Joanna and retold all the joy and love. When he returned home, Mrs. Connery was already waiting for him. When she saw her son's happy expression, she already understood the reason. She said that last night, she waited until four o'clock, and he still hadn't entered the house. But she didn't say any more, and changed the subject. She told him that the overdraft in the bank could no longer be delayed... Therefore, she had already discussed with Virginia that she was willing to accept the mortgage and make a new mortgage again. She told Will to immediately go to Virginia's bank in Charleston to sign the contract. When Will heard that his mother wanted to call him out, his face flushed, and he couldn't speak for a long time. Later, he said... "I can't do it today, I still have... some things I haven't finished." But his mother said very resolutely... "I've already made an appointment with someone, how can you break the appointment?" Old Robert ran in. He looked at Mrs. Connery's stern face, and then at Will's awkward face, and he suddenly laughed. He said... "What a picture of maternal love and filial piety! What's the news today?" Mrs. Connery said... "Will is going to Charleston today." Will hurriedly said... "I didn't say I would definitely go." (To be continued)</p>
