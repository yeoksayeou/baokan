<h3 id="c17">貿易入超與農村經濟敬 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>本年一月份至七月份。我國對外貿易之輸入項下。共計六億四千一百零七萬八千元。輸出項下。三億零三百四十五萬八千元。出入相抵。入超三億三千七百六十七萬元。丁此國困民窮之會。區區七個月間。輸入超過竟至如是之巨。誠不能不令人惕然以懼。夫我國之對外貿易。原無自主之力。在金貴銀賤時代。銀幣外匯之價格較低。輸出貿易。處於比較有利地位。然仍爲各國關稅壁壘所　。不得其門而入。反之。高價洋貨之輸入。則僅受市塲上之自然制限。並未見有顯著之衰落。一九三一年以還。英日諸國相繼放棄金本位制。幣價旣低輸出自便。傾銷貨品。洶湧而來。此爲形咸近年巨額入超之主要原因。固無疑義。至於我國之輸出方面。東三省之大豆及豆餅。原有二萬萬兩以上之貿易。今則悉數爲人攫取以去。生絲輸出。竟不及盛時三分之一。茶業亦極見衰頽。對外貿易之不振。於此可見一斑。在此世界經濟恐慌聲中。世界各國莫不竭力刺激輸出之增加。而奬勵輸入之减少。獨我國缺乏競爭能力。又無經濟國策。遂致代人犧牲。而形成今日之險象。對外貿易以外。如外債本息之償還。數亦不貲。又如各國在華投資總額。共計四十億美金。以八厘計息。每年吸取亦在三億二千萬美金以上。似此不斷剥削。以塡無窮之壑。無論我國人民如何耐勞忍苦。亦必有精疲力竭之一日。</p>
<p>往者。可爲我國謀國際收支之平衡者。除大豆等之特産外。尙有華僑匯欵一項。足資挹注。此類之無形輸入。驟視之。似在整個的國民經濟上。並無多大關係。而不知其對於閩粤諸省實大有裨益也。惟最近數年來。所謂經濟的國家主義。與狹義的民族思想。復盛行於各國。華僑在外經營。旣遭居留國政治上之取締。又逢經濟上之厄運。匪特中産以下之勞力份子。痛感前途之黑暗。卽曾擁巨資之資産家。亦莫不覺前途之渺茫。長此以往。竊恐華僑以前苦鬥之成績。將悉歸消滅。而國家之無形收入。亦必大形跌落。今後果將以何者塡補此𢜪大之入　誠不容不深長思也。</p>
<p>貿易入超之影響於農村經濟者。實　　　。而况　國農業迄今仍不脫手工生産之窠臼。故天惠與勞力並重。缺一不可。一遇天災流行與夫人爲摧殘之時。卽須相當時間。始能恢復元氣。自近代資本主義發達之後。我國整個經濟。皆被其操縱。農村忍受二重剥削。苦不堪言。各國旣在削小其貨幣價值。實行通貨膨脹。我國銀幣之相對提高。則物價之相對低落。爲當然之事。城市新興工業。及農村人民。皆不免交受其困。蓋生産物品旣不敷工資支出。而對外推銷。又有信滯之虞。如生絲與茶葉。卽其明證也。</p>
<p>在此階段之下。其至榖米豐收。亦竟成災。去年實例。印象猶新。今年水旱横行。農民生産。受害更重。卽言最小限度之生活。且不能保遑論其他。農村衰敗之結果。必將引起整個的經濟體系之破滅。固在意中。現在事機日迫。不容再緩。國人可不速起以共挽此經濟之危機耶。</p>

<p>＝日本積極準備＝</p>
<p>＝蘇聯嚴陣以待＝</p>
<p>日本占領了我東北四省後、有兩個很顯明的軍事企圖、一個乘勢北進、劃貝加爾湖以東的地方、入他的版圖、可得到庫頁島北部的石油·與西比利亞森林的利益、一個是乘勝南下·西上、奪取羊毛和棉花的産原地、作他輕工業的根據地、從前他不知道南下西上、要用多少兵力、要費多少錢財、所以不敢輕於動手、現他占領了遼·吉·黑·𤍠、將近三年了、他對於軍事的現實、有更清楚的認識、曉得入關旣不甚難、西上亦甚容易、可以不費什麽兵力、而得享實惠、所以他在南下西上方面、軍事上不甚注意佈置、祇準備些應付的實力、</p>
<p>惟對北進方面、很是積極、因爲日本要應付太平洋海上的戰備、所以石油特别重要、他想運用陸軍、一舉而奪占得石油資源、不得不在北滿方面的軍事、佈置得格外緊張、第一是沿大興安嶺山脈一帶、都用水泥合成混凝土、建築起鋼骨堡壘、許多人跡罕到的山上、都有哨兵把守、禁止遊獵、同時由日本國内經敦賀渡海至清津·越朝鮮國境渡圖門江·至長春的鐵路、已經完成、長春至洮安·懷遠至索倫·以及黑龍江的二站至黑河的鐵道、今年秋後、大槪亦會修成、這些都是軍事上的準備、並且還有汽車路的建築、現在已成的路、有二千五百餘公里、又都是向着北進的國境綫上展開的、</p>
<p>日本空軍的建設、就以在東北四省境内而論、已有飛機塲五十幾處、在遼寗以北的不差不多有四十處、其餘的分散在遼寗西南和𤍠河一帶、</p>
<p>在東北境内的日兵、整個的師團有五個、還有特科部隊·騎兵·砲兵·飛行隊·坦克車隊等等、總計兵力數不下十三萬人、此外再有兩旅白俄軍、十一萬僞軍、飛機約四百架、坦克車一個聯隊、而且大多數都集中在中東鐵路沿綫、</p>
<p>蘇聯鑒於這種威脅、當然决不肯裸身受敵、所以第一步是沿黑龍江·烏蘇里江·建設防禦砲壘、構築永久戰壕、以應付上述的軍事威脅、同時他更明白烏拉爾以東的交通不便、不易集中巨大兵力、不易輸送給養、這是日俄戰爭中、俄國吃虧的最大因素、現在蘇聯當局很認識這一點、所以西比利亞鐵道敷設並行雙軌、已經動工、大約再過一年、就可以完成、</p>
<p>現在蘇聯集結在海參崴·尼哥里斯克一帶的是第十九突聲軍團、他包含得有八</p>

<p>（一）這不算··········</p>
<p>（二）讀書介紹······（續）</p>
<p>（三）本週播音</p>
<p>二，介紹中學生九月號</p>
<p>中學生雜誌，凡是稍稍關心定期刋物的人，大槪都已知道吧？它已有五年的歷史，不僅成了中學生的唯一課外讀物，而且也是一般店員學徒等業餘良好的伴侶，只要有高小程度，就可以看懂了。</p>
<p>這本九月號裏的文章，値得我們特别注意的；如金仲華的「從學到用」是從這次平津大學畢業生的組織謀業同盟，要求各方援助，而論到現在的學校畢業生之後有出路，或一學非所用，和「用非所學」這種矛盾現象的社會根源，極精闢透澈。茅盾的「伊利亞特和奥德賽」，是這一期開始登載起的文學名著講話的第一篇。這兩部世界最古的文學名著，凡愛好文學的讀者，想已聽到過？但中國還没有譯本，（奥德賽最近已有商務書館出版）偶有講到，亦非常簡略。在這裏，以極通俗的籌調，講述了原著的時代背景，作者的藝術手腕，故事的内容，以文學史上的同類作品（這項是據編輯後記的說，因本期還没有登完）等。這部講話如果從古代起直到最近至，合起來就成了一部很通俗的文學史了。張明養的國際政治講話，是從今年一月號登起的。每期一篇，每篇又各自獨立，合看固好，分開也不妨。這期是一篇戰債問題。這問題在近十年來的國際舞臺上是一個很嚴重的問題，每天翻開報紙，差不多就可看到。但是這問題的内容究竟怎樣？爲什麽這樣嚴重的又牽延了十多年還不能解决？或者有許多讀者在這樣懷疑着吧？那麽這篇文章，就是解答這些疑問的。我知道讀者中有不少正在研究社會科學的，普通的書上所講到的大半都是一般的原理原則，和過去的事情，你要把所學的和現實的一切聯繫起來求得個澈底的了解，那你非讀這類的文章和報紙上的新聞不可。</p>
<p>關於自然科學方面，這期有顧均正的潮汐之話和許蒓舫的故學講話，都是用講故事的口吻來講述，讀起來很有趣味，和一般敎科書之枯燥乏味完全不同。其餘如隨筆，偶談，文化消息等類都是這樣，我們可稱之爲一科學小品文」。最後的英文欄，也是今年新添的，對於自修英文的人，很有帮助。</p>
<p>總之，這裏面所包含的方面，非常之廣，篇幅雖然不十分多，但都很精彩，讀者的趣味儘管不同，却都可以取得各人所需要的精神上的食糧。</p>
<p>三，本週播音</p>
<p>讀者諸君以後如有關於無綫電學及醫學上的問題，請直接寄至本報無綫電週刋及醫藥週刋編部，當詳細奉覆。</p>

<p>焦主任連日親赴各學校檢閱</p>
<p>昨暢談本市學校軍訓各問題</p>
<p>本市高中以上學校第二批暑期軍訓行將期滿、昨上海社記者赴國民軍事訓練委員會、晤該會主任委員焦績華氏暢談本市實施國民軍事敎育各問題、歷一小時之久、茲將各點、擇要錄下、</p>
<h3 id="c212">二批軍訓行將結束 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>記者首詢本市二批軍訓情形、據談、本市第二批學校暑期軍訓、自上月二十日左右先後開始以來、迄已兩週本星期内均告期滿結束、連日曾赴各學校檢閱成績尙稱良好、惟碍於學校經費及敎官支配等種種問題之影響、缺點亦在所難免、然精神尤厲重要、欲使軍訓成績良好、第一年須鼓起學生精神、使明白要保存中國的文化、必先養成國民的自衛力量、而青年學生尤應站在前鋒、以領導一般人民、能明白是理、以受軍訓、則成效目大此點除政府方面嚴厲實施外、尤賴學校當局之提倡、與社會方面之鼓勵、以促學生之覺悟、庶能達實施軍訓之目的云、</p>
<h3 id="c213">本學期起全部實施 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>焦氏又謂、國民軍事訓練、包括頗廣、非僅學校軍訓而已、如商人軍訓、工人軍訓、均應實施、惟工商界民衆無固定之集團、無嚴密之組織、又因經費等種種關係、一時當難實現、故中央對各地國民軍事敎育、第一年先自學校開始、現本市已有軍訓之學校、合大學及高中僅三十餘校、全市高中以上學校當不止此數、故大部份未受實施軍訓之學校、自本學期起、將一律實施、各校軍事敎官、日内、將由總監部派來服務、</p>
<h3 id="c214">各校不得私用敎官 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>關於學校方面對軍訓不及格之學生、應遵守部令、嚴格執行、不得任其升級、其次對於軍訓敎官尤不得私自聘用、蓋軍事敎官不能和理化敎員等同樣看待、理化敎員所敎之科學是普天下各國同一原理的、而軍事學則各國有各國不同、如編制及戰術等、各有特殊訓練、故中央對於各學校軍事敎官、須呈准軍事委員會、派敎官訓練班畢業者前往充任、不得由各校擅自任用、以資統一、</p>
<h3 id="c215">明年改變訓練辦法 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>

<p>惜乎後之學者、不但不明白孔子深刻博大的公民敎育原理、而且陽奉陰違、把孔子的遺敎、完全湮没、以致民志日卑、國勢日蹙、如果能把堯舜禹湯文武周公以及孔子的學說原理、一代一代的發揚光大起來、我想、我們中國今日非但决不會如此衰弱、恐怖已成了全世界最强盛的國家了、諸位如嫌我的話大、無根據、祇看日本、就可相信、日本所以能夠這樣强盛、其原因固然很多、惟其中有一個重要原因、就是因爲他們能承繼了我國固有文化而又把他發揚光大、這才造成日本强盛的基礎、（參看戴季陶、日本論）可是我們中國自己却不能繼承自己的固有文化、把他發揚光大、以圖自强、反給人家承繼了去把國家强盛起來、曷勝遺憾、在形式上、我國固代代尊重敬孔子、但其實支配中國人思想的、不是孔子、而是老子（此中原因、須待另篇說明、茲不能詳）、老子的思想、是極端的個人主義的哲學、因爲這個哲學是極端的個人主義、所以他是極端的自私、極端的消極、因爲這個極端自私、極端消極的個人主義敎育的結果、就否認了人類的關係、否認了國家的組織、又毀滅了社會的道德、所以中國民族、說起來雖有四千多年的歷史、却到現在還要給人家駡爲無組織的國家、我們國家所以會無組織、那就是因爲受了這個極端自私極端消極的個人主義的遺毒、致一般國民非但不知其對於國家社會應負的責任、而且把我國固有組織國家、管理社會的敎化、完全毀滅、</p>
<p>到了魏晋六朝時候、這極端自私消極的個人主義、更腐化了、變本加厲了、那時的人民、只求個人的舒適·安逸·享樂、把個人主義的頽敗性與浪漫性、益發的變本加厲起來、因爲個人主義頽敗性與浪漫性的發展、所以將我們人民對社會活動力消失了、社會的責任心也消失了、同時更把人民的向上心也完全消失了、那時人民旣毫無負責與向上精神的表現、因此中國民衆固有的創造文化以及愛護國家社會的精神、都爲這個個人主義的頽敗性與浪漫性完全壓抑了下去、而牠却成爲歷史上很有力的支配我們民族生命的惡勢力、這個惡勢力、從此一直支配了我們中國好幾千年、</p>
<p>到了遜清末葉外力侵凌、國勢日蹙遂有所謂維新運動、維新運動的特徵有二、其一、就是所謂「中學爲體、西學爲用、」所謂西學爲用、就是堅甲利兵、擴張兵備、殊不知我們國民的活動力、已消失殆盡、雖有銳利槍砲、也是無可運用、其二、是康有爲的變法、他以爲如果要國家强、祇須把法變更一下就可以了、康氏的理論、也未免捨本逐末因爲幾千年來支配我們民性的惡勢力、換言之、就是不向上、不負責、不努力的個人主義的頽敗性與浪漫性、如果不把它根本剷除　變法也是徒然、其結果自不免失敗、所以維新運動到後來仍舊未能將中國興起來、日本的維新運動、與我們同時、而他們却成功了、他們成功的原因、就是因爲他們能務其本、培養他們的國力、而我們的維新運動、却未能從根做起、未能把我們國民的劣性根本改造、使之向上奮發、自然不能有倖成之可能了、後來梁啟超先生創辦新民叢報提倡新民說、他想從根本上刷新民族、振發民心、他眞可謂是我的同志、他那時在新民叢報發表的言論、例如提倡公德·尙武·愛國·利他·冒險·並介紹西洋學術、都甚切要、可是、梁啟超的文章鋒芒雖很尖利、氣魄雖很浩蕩、究竟能打動了全國國民的心坎没有、在座諸君大槪都讀過梁啟超的文章、讀他文章的時候、想無不爲他所感動、然而我們全國這許多芸芸衆生、還是木然無所動於衷、這是因爲他的主張、没有普遍的深入民間、所以他還是未能救得我們民族、這是我特别要希望在座諸位敎師深切注意、而繼續努力的、</p>
<p>自是以後、國人鑒於科舉制度的失敗、又提倡新學、但是提倡新學以後、又發生一種新的病態、就是不切國情的歐化、因爲這種歐化敎育、不合我們民族的需要不明中國的歷史國情、以及固有文化的特徵、所以結果弄得我們中國一般人、連本國各地方的名詞都不曉得、却知道了西洋各國的地名、甚而至於本國的公民歷史地理等課本、都不加選擇的採用外國本子、最荒唐的、一般大學、甚至一部分中學的敎師、不論講解、命題、以及學校佈告、都一槪盲目的用外國文、因此這種極端歐化敎育所訓練出來的、不是中國的公民却是迷信西洋的順民、這種新敎育、能復興民族嗎　能啟發國民對國家民族𤍠烈的情感嗎、興念及此實在不能不令我們十分痛心、五四新文化運動、本來負有極重要的時代的使命誠能指導得方、脚踏實地的做去、未始不是我國民族一個復興的機會、但是不幸、這運動的後面、却跟來了一個鬼、就是浪漫放任的自由主義、因此中國民族仍是没有脫離傳統的個人主義的頽敗性和浪漫性的支配、所以五四新文化運動結果並未能發生若何效力、直至現在、國家社會各方面的情形、益復江河日下、你們都是小學敎師、你們看現在的敎育比從前如何、從前的學風、與現在的學風、優劣如何、社會的紀律等等亦莫不每况愈下、此其原因、恐不能不說是自由主義、個人主義、浪漫主義、作祟的結果吧、而現在社會上一般人、大都還是朦朦懂懂地受了這個極端浪漫主義的支配、而不知覺悟這種民族、如何會振作起來發生力量呢、</p>
<p>我現在已把由堯舜湯文武周公到新文化運動、這一部錯綜複雜的歷史約略地拾討過了、我們從這一個歷史的過程中、就可以透視出我們民族所以衰落的因緣、這個民族衰落的歷史因緣、簡括地講起來、一方面、是堯舜禹湯文武周公以及孔子、那些組織國家、組織社會、以及敎育民衆的原理、未能發揚光大起來、而一方面老子的極端自利的個人主義、却支配了幾千年的人心、以致我們國民、大家對於社會國家不能發生關係、也不能盡其責任、發揮他的力量、因此、我們只看見個人主義的頽敗性浪漫和自私性的發展、而不看見國民對社會國家的責任心、向上心、和活動力的表現、這就是我們中國人民所以不能發生力量的原因、也是我們中國民族、所以衰落的歷史因緣、（參看拙著中國社會運動之路向、載在中國社會創刋號及前途一卷五號、）</p>
<p>三各國民族發展之原因及其公民性之觀察中國民族之所以衰　、旣如上述、然而世界各國的民族、又何以能强盛吧、此中原因、頗值研究、先看西洋各民族的情形怎樣、西洋各民族無論是大國或是小國、他們一般的都是很强即如比利時、這樣的小國、他尙且能抵抗德國、而其建設能力的表現、尤爲各國所歏佩、我們考究他們民族所以發展的原因有三、</p>
<p>一、民族主義之發展、自十九世紀以來、西洋各國的民族主義、甚爲發展、他們各國的學者、對於民族主義的提倡也都不遺餘力其最著名的、如意國的Massii德國的FichteHegelSauigngEluingEluntochliPalman法國的RamanLarmati　e等等學者文人、都是於文藝上政論上、法學上竭力担倡民族主義、喚起國民民族的意識、而我國的學者文人、大都不問政治、不知國家、或則吟風弄月、玩物喪志、或則標新立異、鼓惑羣衆、大都缺乏𤍠烈的民族的情緒、因此、近百年來、歐洲各國自波羅的海至地中海均有𤍠烈的民族運動、這些都是他們學者文人努力提倡發展民族主義的功績、其中最重要的、如德國意國之統一、尤爲轟轟烈烈的史績、而我們現在、却還是四分五裂、内戰不已、各逞私智不顧大局、</p>
<p>二、社會道德之發展、社會道德之發展、講起來很爲鎖屑、我現在祇能簡略講一點、所謂社會道德、其實就是孔子的「仁義禮信、」可惜在中國没有發展、却跑到西洋去發展、西洋各國没有孔子、而他們却有仁義禮信、我們中國雖有孔子、而反没有仁義禮信、這就是中華民國之所以衰、中國社會之所以亂、西洋民族之所以興西洋社會之所以治、我記得我從前由歐洲回國的時候、第一次有人請我去演講、主席要我把外國繁華的情形講給他們聽一聽、我當時很感痛、開頭就說我今天所要講的、你們聽了一定會很失望、我不願和大家講外國繁華的情形、因爲外國的物質文明以及外國繁華侈奢的情形、都已侵入我們中土了、祇要跑到上海天津廣州各處去一看、都可明瞭、不必再講、我今天所要講的是我們中國自己流落他鄕的東西、我們中國的歷史上、有一個最好的東西、就是仁義禮信、是孔子的遺敎、可是我們中國現在却找不出仁義禮信、中國現在是不仁不義不禮不信、而在外國倒有這個仁義禮信、我在外國旣然遇見了這個流落他鄕的國寳、不能不向各位報告、我覺得西洋社會之所以發展、是因爲仁義禮信社會道德之發展、「仁」就是一種社會的同情心、西洋人這種精神、最爲發展、無論何處都可看見、不像我們中國人在馬路上看見一個人跌了一交、不但不扶他起來、還要在旁拍手大笑、講到「義」、中國人對於難事偷懶巧避、毫無見義勇爲的精神、而西洋人的義風甚盛、不講别的、就是看他們對國家民族的義、是義極了、他們爲國家民族社會、都肯不惜時間、不惜犧牲、奮不願身的去赴湯踏火、我們再看在上海的外國人、他們在救火的時候、都是很出力、在上海的外國人其實還遠不如他們住在本國的人、而他們尙且有如此之義更可想其本國人民的德性了、</p>

<p>Ｊ·ＰＡＲＭＬ　ＰＡＲＥＴ原著錢一勤洪均合譯</p>
<p>｜版權所有不准轉載｜</p>
<p>手臂由身前向後擺、球拍要一直擺到左肩的後面、球拍向前擺動去迎擊來球的時候、大槪是和腰部的高度相等、並且要略微在球員所立的地位的前面、反手拍擊、最要儘量向前擺到右肩處、球拍和球剛接觸的時候、球員全身｜由臀部而胸部而肩部｜｜應當順着向前轉動、在拍擊動作完畢以後、球員的面部、差不多是對着球網、此種身軀的轉動、就將體重和順勢力增加了拍擊的力量、</p>
<p>當來球迎面過着手腕的扭動、好像在正手拍擊時一樣、球身必旋轉地向前飛去、此時拍弦應拖過球身、球面受着刷擊、於是就産生了旋轉的動作、這就是此式特殊手法、使球向前旋轉着飛去、就是增加球上方的空氣壓力、而减少球下方的空氣壓力、於是球向前飛時、就有較速降落的趨勢、並且很重地擊去、球還是不飛越界綫、</p>
<p>反手上方扭擊式完畢時、球拍應擺到比拍擊起首時較高的地方去、因爲此種拍擊、球拍是向上擺動的、球拍和球相接觸的時間、要儘量延長、在球已離拍弦飛去後、右臂要儘量向右邊擺去、將順勢使完、因爲體重和肩部都順着向右邊儘量擺去、右臂又向右邊儘量地仲直、所以順勢力就能夠完全使用得罄盡、</p>
<p>此種方式拍擊完畢時、球拍停止動力的實在地位、按照扭轉來球的動量、各不同的球員有不同的地位、有的球員極端地將球拍扭向右肩水平以上、還有很少數的球員、他們祇將球拍擺到半圓周以上的地位就停止、不過他們扭轉球身的力量、就要弱得多、這是很明顯的、</p>
<p>反手上方扭擊式較之正手上方扭擊式要難得多、當然是無疑義的、但有的球員、專門練精此種手法、反倒認爲容易、數年以前、有一位新成名的球員、他簡直專喜用反手去迎擊來球、這位球員名呌皮耳Ｔ·Ｒ·Ｐell、他對於反手上方扭擊式發明了極精敏的手法和力量、於是單單採用此種手法、已使他在許多聯賽中屢次得勝、</p>
<p>講到反手下方削擊式、或下方劈擊式、那就較反手上方扭擊式容易得多、球拍預先向後的擺動、没有上方扭擊式那樣遠、不過要略微比較高些、是向前拍擊時、角度是略斜向下的、所以球身和球拍的接觸是一種從下方的掃擊、自然拍擊後球拍是較爲降低、並且這種從下方的掃擊、使拍弦在球底擦轉球身、於是球就向後旋轉的往前死去、</p>
<p>因爲球拍須經過球身的下面、所以反手下方扭擊式拍擊完畢後、不僅球拍停止的地位不同、並且拍面斜回的角度也不同、</p>
<p>至於下方劈擊式拍擊完畢後球拍擺到的地位就要更低、下方削擊式和下方劈擊式的異點、就是在使球旋轉的方法上不同、向下劈擊的時候、球拍祇要略斜向後、拍擊時是由上向下斜劈去的、而且掃擊的力量也較大、於是球拍是更往下降落的、至於下方削擊式球拍就更要向後斜着、然後直擊出身下去、但是拍向的擺動較少、</p>
<p>反手下方削擊式是一種驚人的防禦方法、若是能夠練到鐵爾登的一樣手法的時候、竟可以算是一種危險的攻擊法、因爲球的擺動的過程較短、預備拍擊的時間也就少些、因而可以將向對方瞄凖的方位隠藏起來、使對手無從預測、球員對於球拍的管束也便當些、祇要將手腕略微變動、就可以改變拍擊的方位、較之其他拍擊方式手法要靈活得多、</p>
<p>當球員受到對手的威逼遠退到塲區極左邊的角上去迎擊來球的時候、球員應用下方劈擊式、是能夠轉危爲安的、此時若應用其他方式、就必失誤或是還擊的力量者甚弱、再應用反手上方扭擊式的時候、球員必要遠退到拍擊地位的後方、這本身就是一種弱點、没有下方劈擊式來得方便、</p>

<h3 id="c229">從二十四史說起 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>似乎是梁啟超說過二十四史是中國學人｜無論學工學農的｜所必讀之書。不過他也認爲是不得已的辦法，他很慨然於中國尙未有專史，通史，所以才仍不能不求助於這些帝王私乘，相斫書，乃至總之是古物堆。在他的著作中，他自己也曾自期地以爲可以弄出一部像樣的通史來，可惜他的大部份精力在做官，打牌上花了，他遺下的一點雄心，也不知他的門徒曾否接受，但到現在離他許願是十多年，續願者似在渺茫，而中國未有像樣的通史，二十四爲重要的史料，仍成流通二十四者的重要理由。</p>
<p>開明的九本裝二十五史在售預約了。這辦法有幾方面，自然很可贊美。把這部龐然大著，集成少少的九本，先使人覺得這並不是一部讀不了的書，無形增加人讀他的勇氣。不過能讀是一問題，讀了全部做什麽却又是一問題。在横方面，專研究一代的各方面的人，所須只某代及其前後兩代的史書，這樣，爲這類的讀者的便利，二十四史根本不應整部發售。專研究各代的某一方面的人，所須的是各史上的某一部份，爲他們的便利，似該把刋行的辦法改變一下。前一項不成什麽重要問題，後一項却很可注意。</p>
<p>天文研究所爲了研究歷代天文的記載，買了全部百衲本二十四史，然而他們所能用到的不過天文志，五行志等。天文志，五行志，又實在爲平常的讀者所不能讀或無須讀。我們雖不易新編一天文史資料，但把二十四史中的所有的天文志，五行志集印一起，却不是一件難事。費力一點，把漢書，隋書，明史中的爲主，把其餘各史中同文注明，異文注出，兼採取通志之類的記載，同樣辦理，不難成一較爲可用的書；否則照樣翻印也較便應用。二十四史的只能爲參考書，已是公認，參考書就該有參考書的優點。</p>
<p>就便想起回書集成來。中國類書，分類爲多，旣係分類，就可單行。十四版的大英百科全書，因爲已龐大到非一般應用所需，所以除整部之外，另編分類零册，另行發售。而我們本來分類的却非整部發售不可，改進與保守之差，眞太大了。其實如果二十四史天文志之類的刋本能印出，則圖書集成中的乾象典曆法典就可廢的</p>
<p>翻印二十四史，至少各史的志表，該歸總分印（但如宋史中的趙氏家譜，最好爽快地删掉，存目卽可，）帝紀，列傳，不妨依姓式排列，改編一人名大字典，而把原書的次序，列作附表。外國傳｜四夷傳，匈奴傳，西域傳｜也可編爲專册。近代西洋中國學者，把匈奴，突厥等二十四史中所有資料集成專書，而中國把他翻回來作新著出售，就書賈謀利說，自屬當然，而就學術上說，不能不算是羞辱，我們的翻印二十四史者，如果肯分國編集，並把關連的文字輯入，則其所成就，不止是出版上的革命，而是不朽盛業。</p>
<p>新舊唐書，新舊元史的疊床架屋，如依上法，就也自然消泯。實在，就不是拆散二十四史重編，這兩史也是與其作兩本的重疊，還不如疊在一部之内。以新的作正本，舊本中材料同删異注地編在同一材料之下，也就可以並存，而檢閱更便，而篇幅的减少，猶其餘事。</p>
<p>分類改編的二十四史，可以絲毫無改於原書的本質，大家仍可以找到他們所要找的，所不同的是更容易找到。這也不是把原書割裂，而是把原來割裂的聚攏。這該是個十全的辦法，然而迄今無人提起，則大槪是因淺近者不願意惹這麻煩，而高遠者又覺得這僅是剪刀漿糊的工作。但我相信不經過這一刀漿工作，高遠者的專史通史，都會鑽之彌遠。</p>
<p>九本裝的定價，也算很便宜，其不圖重利也可贊美。不過如專就廉價說，則照現在所翻印的通俗小說樣的裝訂價格，似仍可便宜過半。然卽使能十元八元能買二十四史，買來有不必讀的部分卽是浪漫了一部分，不知不必讀的而費精神去讀了，尤其是無可補償的損失。我們如果終不能有一部改編好的二十四史，自然拉到，如果能有編出的一天，則多一次原樣翻印，也是一番浪費。這次的翻印大槪是無可挽回的了，但如有再想翻印者，我們希望不要僅想以更廉的價格競爭，實在在編製，發售上，還有更好的出路。</p>
<h3 id="c230">專論小大 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 尖哥</p>
<p>如果有人爭論小品文和大衆語的問題，則願意供給一些討論的資料··</p>
<p>何者爲大？</p>
<p>大槪是文章長，爲大品··文章短，爲小品。但只看當代要人的文字，動輒數十萬言，是不是大品？如果覺得那些話是「大」，則文學界從此知如何用力了，總之不斷的寫下去，愈長愈大，愈大愈長，可以打破世界作品的紀錄。</p>
<p>從古到今，一萬字以上的詩並不多見；玉川生好像拚命的寫下去了，比方韵月蝕，然而也不見得怎樣長；可傳之句，倒是很簡單的幾句，但詩從來不算小品。可見專論形式不能分大小。</p>
<p>古代文章中有很短小的，如班孟堅勒蒸然銘，蘭亭序，桃花源記，這些是否小品文呢？這又好像皆是大品文。其内容也很難分大小，因爲所寫的東西如此不同。</p>
<p>那麽又論到袁中郎了，這一類文字，是小品文。内容專談怎樣喝茶，噉飯，玩花草，遊山水。但懂到生活的藝術，不止中郎，論風雅，也不獨中郎，這類文字，也不獨中郎會寫，古來懂到生活藝術的，尤其是在六朝，眞不知有多少人。可見也不能以作家爲標準。</p>
<p>形式，内容，作家，皆不能作標準，可見大品小品，並是虚妄計度，無謂紛爭。但終於作品有偉大與否可分，這分，在乎作品本身，與其所出發的人格。</p>
<p>所以一方面寫小品文，一方面也不妨反對或憎恨「小品文」。正如自己說話，也仍然可以駡人說話一樣。論者謂以小品攻小品爲不該，那麽攻擊者皆當著書百卷來攻擊「小品文」了。那麽寫了一篇小品文就應該擁護「小品文」了。</p>
<p>必有一日，那麽寫小品眞個「小」了下去，又大言這眞是偉大，那纔如何是了也。</p>

<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（九）專化呢，普遍化呢？</p>
<p>到了這里，就又碰着了一個大問題··中國的言語，各處很不同，單給　個粗枝大葉的區别，就有北方話，江浙話，兩湖川貴話，福建話，廣東話這五種，而這九種中，還有小區别。現在用拉丁字來寫，寫普通語，還是寫土話呢？要寫普通話，人們不會；倘寫土話，别處的人們就看不懂，反而隔核起來，不及全國通行的漢字了。這是一個大弊病！</p>
<p>我的意思是··在開首的啟蒙時期，各地方各寫牠的土話，用不着顧到和别地方意思不相通。當未用拉丁寫法之前，我們的不識字的人們，原没有用漢字互通着聲氣，所以新添的壞處是一點也没有的。倒有新的益處，至少是在同一語言的區域裏，可以彼此交換意見，吸收智識了｜｜那當然，一面也得有人寫些有益的書。問題倒在這各處的大衆語文，將來究竟要牠專化呢，還是普通化？</p>
<p>方言土語裏，很有些意味深長的話，我們那里呌「煉話」，用起來是很有意思的，恰如文言的用古典，聽者也覺得趣味津津　各就各處的方言，將語法和詞彙，更加提煉，使他發達上去的，就是專化。這於文學，是很有益處的，牠可以做得比僅用泛泛的話頭的文章更加有意思。但專化又有專化的危險。言語學我不知道，看生物，是一到專化，往往要滅亡的。未有人類以前的許多動植物，就因爲太專化了，失其可變性，環境一改，無法應付，只好滅亡。｜｜幸而我們人類還不算專化的動物，請你們不要愁。大衆，是有文學，要文學的，但决不該爲文學做犧牲，要不然，他的荒謬和爲了保存漢字，要十分之八的中國人做文盲來殉難的活聖賢就並不兩樣。所以，我想，啟蒙時候用方言，但一面又要漸漸的加入普通的語法和詞彙去。先用固有的，是一地方的語文的大衆化，加入新的去，是全國的語文的大衆化。</p>
<p>幾個讀書人在書房裏商量出來的方案，固然大抵行不通，但一切都聽其自然，却也不是好辦法。現在在碼頭上，公共機關中，大學校裏，確已有着一種好像普通話模樣的東西，大家說話，旣非「國語」，又不是京話，各各帶着鄕音，鄕調，却又不是方言，即使說的喫力，聽的也喫力，然而總歸說得出，聽得懂。如果加以整理，幇牠發達，也是大衆語中的一支，說不定將來還簡直是主力。我說要在方言裏一加入新的去一那新的的來源就在這地方。待到這一種出于自然。又加人工的話一普遍，我們的大衆語文就算大致統一了。</p>
<p>此後當然還要做。年深月久之後，語文更加一致，和一煉話一一樣好，比古典還要活的東西，也漸漸的形成，文學就更加精采了。馬上是辦不到的。你們想，國粹家當作寳貝的漢字，不是化了三四千年工夫，這才有這麽一堆古怪成績麽？</p>
<p>至于開乎要誰來做的問題，那不消說··是覺悟的讀書人。有人說··「大衆的事情，要大衆自己來做！」那當然不錯的，不過得看看說的是什麽脚色。如果說的是大衆，那有一點是對的，對的是要自己來，錯的是推開了幇手。倘使說的是讀書人呢，那可全不同了；他在用漂亮話把持文字，保護自己的尊榮。</p>

<p>｜｜用論語，孔子世家，仲尼弟子列傳的材料｜｜</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>「媽，我的爸爸呢？」</p>
<p>「孩子，你還年輕；等你年紀大了一點，我再告訴你！」</p>
<p>「他們都說我野孩子呐！」</p>
<p>「不要理他，他們都是没家敎的！」</p>
<p>顔氏把仲尼擁在懷裏，涙珠一顆一顆的滴在她兒子的臉上。</p>
<p>「媽，你怎麽哭啦？」</p>
<p>顔氏用右裏揩乾自己的眼涙，俯頭吻着仲尼的額上，低聲說道··</p>
<p>「孩子，你還年輕呐！」</p>
<p>這個大謎子藏在仲尼的心頭，一年又一年，他想很快就變成大人了，他媽媽會把那謎底告訴他了。一年又一年，他媽媽畢竟不曾把謎底告訴他。一天，顔氏病得利害，呌仲尼走近床前··</p>
<p>「孩子，你過來，我告訴你·····」</p>
<p>未及發言，顔氏的聲音已經咽住了。仲尼看他母親這樣痛苦，趕忙用話安慰她道··</p>
<p>「媽，等媽病好一點再詳細告訴我好了。」</p>
<p>「你媽的病是不會好的了！孩子，你爸的事，曼父（那個陬人）的母親，她是知道得清清楚楚的。」</p>
<p>不久，顔氏死了，那時，仲尼已經二十四歲了。他從曼父母親那兒知道一點自己父母結合的經過，以及他父親死後殯葬的所在。他把父親的靈柩和母親的靈柩合葬在防山的邊上。土墳做好以後，仲尼伏在墳上，哀哀地號泣道··</p>
<p>「媽，我是知道得清清楚楚的了！」</p>
<p>「伯魚！你把周南召南唸熟了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是，早唸過了；唸那些山歌有什麽用呢？」</p>
<p>「孩子，人情世故，人情世故，這里面都是人情世故呀！」</p>
<p>「爸爸，我唸給你聽羆··</p>
<p>「關關睢鳩，在河之洲，</p>
<p>窈窕淑女，羣子好求；</p>
<p>參差行菜，左右流之，</p>
<p>窈窕淑女，寤寐求之；</p>
<p>求之不得，寤寐思服，</p>
<p>悠哉悠哉，輾轉反側。」</p>
<p>仲尼閉着眼兒，靜聽伯魚的歌聲，手輕輕在几上拍着。忽然，他有所感觸似的說··</p>
<p>「伯魚，你去罷！」</p>
<p>伯魚走出仲尼的書室，仲尼還遠遠聽到他的歌聲··</p>
<p>「野有死麕，白茅包之，</p>
<p>有女懷春，吉士誘之！</p>
<p>·················」</p>
<p>仲尼低聲自言自語道··</p>

<p>後來我們的部隊被打敗了，那親戚也没有了事，家鄕的生活更困，而家裏的小店子也只好關門了，弟弟跟我也就不得不另外想辦法去。弟弟又進了一個軍官學校，我也進一個。到這時，大家每逢放星期，才一塊兒玩玩。雖然那怪皮氣並不就抛了的。</p>
<p>記得在他畢業的時候我向他說要買一條斜皮帶送他。那天趁他還没有來的時候，我約着幾個同學一道去買。因爲錢少，買了一條中等的。當我們在公園裏等他來的時候，我很高興地給他，以爲他也一定很高興了；可是他把皮帶拿着看了一下，又望望他腰上借來拴的那一條最寛的皮帶，斗然臉色轉青，眼睛發直，把皮帶拍的一聲丢在椅上，轉身就走。朋友們都驚異起來了。弄得我恨不得要跳起來打他幾下，但我終於和平下來，把他拉回，許他另外買一條去。他才在許多驚異的眼光中愤愤地坐下來了。</p>
<p>從此以後，他分配到另一個部隊，我們就没有機會見面。而我的生活也夜此開始急速變化起來了。</p>

<p>在北平住過的人，没有不知道這白茶的故事的。這個故事，跟沙鍋居那個老招待，曾經侍候過西太后是一樣的被一般人所傳述着。</p>
<p>據說白茶是頂貴重的，可以說是茶中的頭子。在前清時候，只有皇族才吃得起，窮人不用說吃白茶；就是連看看白茶的眼福都没有。</p>
<p>可是現在生活在北平的遺老（他們穿着古老的長袍大褂，走起路來還是摇摇擺擺，就像去朝見他們的主子那樣。他們還在做着往昔的夢啊！）他們已經窮到有的把女兒賣到堂子去做妓女，有的吃這頓没有那頓的過活着。</p>
<p>可是他們還在吃白茶｜這呌做窮派頭。因爲他們以往都是吃白茶；現在不吃白茶，不是顯得没落了嗎！他仍是不願意顯出自己没落的。雖然他們已經没落到不能再没落了。</p>
<p>他們窘到吃飯都成了問題，那裏還有錢買白茶吃？老實說，他們不但買不起白茶，就是好一點的茶都買不起啊！而且是吃不起來啊！</p>
<p>他們來了客人，因爲没有茶，就把以往喝過的乏茶，檢出一些葉子整齊的，放到茶杯裏；這樣不但没有一點味道，而且一點顔色也没有！</p>
<p>可是客人要好奇的問起來，他們就會很客氣的說··「這是頂上的白茶！」</p>
<p>雖然客人不相信他們這套鬼話；但是也不好說什麽；只好唯唯的點頭稱是。誰肯揭破他們這可憐的秘密呢！</p>

<p>於此，我們更可想見他們的子孫之所以不來祭掃，必然是經濟狀况實在窘到不堪的緣故；而那死者在地下所懷的苦悶，也越發不忍想像了！</p>
<p>伊所指點着的那些荒墳，實在就是義塚；義塚乃是地方上的慈善機關所經營的，並不是個人所能擔任的善舉，這一點伊老人家可就纒誤了。</p>
<p>談到掃墓，雖然每個人的原意都是相同的；但它的形式，却因各人的經濟能力之不同，又必分爲以下的幾種··第一種是富貴人家。他們必先端整下一席十分豐盛的酒菜，讓僕從們槓抬着，恭而敬之的去陳列在他們的祖墓的面前；一面焚化紙錠，一面叩頭行禮。這樣陳列上幾十分鐘，他們便把所有的酒菜，依舊端回去，一古腦兒的送進了自己的肚子中去。第二種是中等人家。他們雖也不致無力整治酒菜，但他們的祖先旣没有明明白白地向他們要索，他們便决意從簡了；可是紙錠總是帶去焚化的，因爲自古相沿成習，雖然從不曾有人舉出過實證來，但大家都深信紙錠焚化之後，死者便可得到眞的銀子了；好在活人原不須用紙錠，只要化不到多少的錢，便可買到許多的紙錠了。如其眞要他們把活人自己要用的鈔票，錢票，洋錢，去焚化給死人用，他們便抵死也不肯了！第三種是中等以下的人家，這些人家的經濟狀况，大槪用「捉襟見肘」四個字來形容，必然是很確切的了。（一二一）</p>

<p>在歐美，據說「𤍠」比「冷」跑得快，所以民間到處都是「𤍠氣。」同時，對於「冷」却非常厭惡，因此盛行着“CatchCold”這個名詞。大槪歐美人的心目中，「冷」是被認爲有「傷」民「風」的！</p>
<p>中國的民間就不是這樣，似乎有「瘧鬼」在作祟。這瘧鬼大槪生前是壽終在夏季的，畏𤍠喜冷，所以「𤍠」散佈得很慢，且又不能持久，五分鐘這麽一霎就退熱了。但［冷］却進展得很快。並能一二年甚至數十年的持久下去！因此中國的民間是冷冰冰的一片！</p>

<h3 id="c264">談游記 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 陳師誠</p>
<p>「盡信書則不如無書。」開口就背孟子，我可並不是借孟老夫子來裝幌子嚇人··現在時代，孟老夫子的幌子已是不行。中國是摩登化了；摩登人的心理··無論人物，學術，都做了老婆，｜老婆是人家的好｜。要嚇人，也許還是借蕭伯納，高爾基···等外國幌子來得硬朗。我背孟子是··要實行八股式套調子的玩意兒，說一句「盡信游記則不如無游記」。游記的通病是失實；因其失實，所以不可盡信。</p>
<p>寫游記的作者，並不是故意要失實。其所以失實的原因，大約不出下列五種··（一）刻意求工，（二）濫用辭藻，（三）見識環境的不同，（四）體力强弱的各異，（五）觀察力的薄弱。</p>
<p>好勝是人類同具的心理；作文時如果不能别出心裁去找一種出奇制勝的方法，就不能壓倒羣英。所以「不肯作平凡語」六字，是中國文學上的好評語。游記雖應當是一種記實的文字；也免不了受這種心理的影響。</p>
<p>辭藻是文字内不可少的緊要條件；描寫風景，尤其要仰仗牠的大力。文言文裏的辭藻，往往成爲一種「成語」。他們爲了避免「杜撰」的譏誚，而努力應用「成語」的緣故；就是數十尺高的石壁，幾丈深的水潭；一槪用「壁立千仭」和「萬丈深潭」的成語來形容牠。八尺爲仭，千仭就是八千尺，十尺爲丈，萬丈就是十萬尺。誰又見過八千尺高的石壁，十萬尺深的水潭？事實上雖不能說，也不敢說没有那麽高，那麽深的壁和潭；然而總不會有··是石壁一定高八千尺，是水潭一定深十萬尺，而没有一些參差的道理。濫用辭藻和成語，是游記失實的第二原因。</p>
<p>人們的觀念，是隨環境和見識而變遷的。生長在市廛中的人，只要離開了塵囂直上的都市，到鄕村裏去；雖然並没有什麽奇麗的風景，也覺得清幽宜人，處處入畫，使人心曠神怡。若是在鄕間住慣的，就是會發生上述的感想。還有，生平未曾見過山的人，一旦有機會見到了杭州西湖邊上的南北高峯或蘇州天平，天池諸山，自然就感覺到牠的偉大和高峻。要是換了一個登過天目，雪竇的人，就不會發生那高峻偉大的感想。再換一個朝過五獄，游過峨眉，雪山的人，不但南北高峯，天平，天池，不過是一個培塿；就是雪竇諸山，也算不了甚麽高。人們的環境，見識，旣然各各不同，雖然游的是同一地點，所發感想，也是各異。那麽所寫的游記，自然就不會一致。</p>
<p>體力的强弱，也和環境，見識，一般的各各不同。健步的人，跑一百或八十里路，原算不了什麽！跑不動的，走三五里路，就覺舉步艱難。善於爬山的雖登很高峻的山峯，也是不見得怎樣吃力；不善爬山的，只要走幾步山路，即覺氣喘腿酸！受了體力衰弱的影響，不免將近作遠，將低作高。我曾見過一篇杭州葛嶺游記··他老人家從杭城出發，步行到葛嶺之麓，就說足力已疲；登山時已如强弩之末，舉步維艱。又把葛嶺描寫得高不可攀。在未曾到過杭州的人，讀了這記，一定疑惑葛嶺離杭州城不知有多少遠？嶺又不知有多麽高？但是，被游過葛嶺的人看了，就不免要啞然失笑。這是因體力衰弱，而使游記失實的明證。</p>
<p>當我們游歷的時候，所見山川草木，作記時當然有描寫的必要。山有多麽高？河有多麽闊？我們不能用尺來一一量過；只好憑着自己的觀察力來判斷。雖然不能十分凖確，總不可以信口亂說的；如果常識不足，觀察力薄弱；那麽，臆測的結果，必至和事實相去太遠；那豈不成了笑話麽？</p>

<h3 id="c265">告「心緩」的朋友 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>討論任何一種學術，或任何一個問題，無論其討論的對象，值得討論或不值得討論，須先有兩種態度，（一）是研究的態度，（一）是虚心的態度。</p>
<p>因爲前者，「智者千慮必有一失，愚者千慮必有一得，」故學術愈研究愈精進，問題愈討論愈徹底，後者，「滿招損，謙受益，」此兩語雖也是老古話，但是在做人或是研究學問的地方，還是用得着，假定一種學術或是一個問題，祇有我的主張，而决不容許他人的主張，這種褊狹的見解，仍舊沿用着從前學者黨同伐異的故智來抹煞一切，這是萬萬要不得的。</p>
<p>上月本刋内發表何先生批評文學一週年紀念特輯「我與文學」一文後，文學第三卷第三號文學論壇裏，就有華先生的「告心急的朋友」一文，對於何先生的一文，天然大肆攻擊，這兩篇文字，那一篇是對，那一篇是不對，我並没有許多精神和時間來批判，不過華先生在「告心急的朋友」一文中，有這樣幾句話，并且這幾句話，並不是對何先生而發，我不得不提出來解釋解釋。</p>
<p>「例如前幾天有人提出大衆語問題，不也同時申報的談言裏就出來了一位心急的朋友，馬上要求他們做幾大衆語的作品來看看麽。」</p>
<p>難道這句說話又是差了麽？差在那裏？就是心急，就是要主張大衆語的作家先做幾篇大衆語標準的文字來看，確眞，我是差了，我是太心急了，他們提倡大衆語；本來是喊喊口號的，互相標榜的，用不着作品來看，所以事實是不能問的，并不許問的，尤其是要求他們做出大衆語標準的文字，公開的給人家看，眞是冒昧得很，空頭支票可爛發，但是决不許人家兌現，眞是奇事。</p>
<p>先生也許是一位文學家，我就拿刋物來比方給先生聽，譬如先生創作一本刋物，在書局子裏發行，但是購書的一定先要看一看書的内容，書的性質，方才可買，從來没有聽見過，書局子裏只有買的書籍，而没有看的書籍，再退一步說，我這部書還没有成功，先售預約券，已帶三分滑頭性質，但是這書的内容如何，何時出版，總要報告給人家聽，方好呌大家去購買，若只有書的名目，而内容不許宣布，出版也無定期，便要使一般讀者來相信去購買，我想這種辦法，只有鬭撲克牌可以手裏祇有一對小二，能使人家一對「開」或是「侃乎」，多丢掉在牌堆裏，這原呌做偷機，在文壇上恐怕没有這樣一回事。</p>
<p>因爲我的腦筋，没有象華先的的靈敏道地，所以不懂得大衆語究屬是怎樣的一種文字，所以要請主張大衆語的作家，做幾篇標準的大衆語，使一般愚笨不過｜像我輩一流｜的民衆來效法效法，豈知就大碰其壁，觸犯了先生的忌諱，非特不肯賜敎，而惱羞成怒，夾七夾八，說我也是一位「心急」朋友，在這裏我不免有些疑惑起來，幾位先生主張的大衆語，到底葫蘆瓢裏賣甚麽藥呢？不由得使我不「心急」。</p>
<p>現在就拿五四時白話運動來說，當時主張白話文的作家，他們就自己做起白話文來，以資提倡。無論他們的白話文，是不是代表資本主義的産物，但是他們並非空口說白話，畢竟拿一些東西出來，現在提倡的大衆語，究屬拿些甚麽東西出來給我們看呢？白話文運動，已經差不多近二十年之久，試問白話文是否可以說完全成功，文言是否已經死光？我到不敢說這句話；因爲公文書裏頭還是滿紙文言文，報紙裏頭十九多是文言文，怎樣可以說白話文是完全成功呢？文言文是完全死光呢？</p>
<p>白話文旣經還不完全成功，又來提倡大衆語，這樣的「心急」，恐與我輩也五十步笑百步罷？自己對於大衆語一些没有準備，一些没有計劃，僅僅高喊口號，互相標榜，亦是「心急」，現在大衆語旣經不曾出來，先不許人們開口，不許人們討論，此種「心急法」恐怕比我們還要厲害，所以我勸勸先生，且慢慢地笑我們「心急」罷，姑且再去問問他人，到底那個「心急」。</p>
<p>笑我心急的，不僅先生一人，大槪主張大衆語的先生們，或者多要來笑我「心急」。他們有幾種笑法··一種笑法說，從前孫中山先生主張革命，何嘗先拿出東西來看，一種笑法說，理想爲事實之母。這兩種說法，第一種完全瞎說，絶對没有理由，因爲政治革命，或種族革命，可以拿非常手段出來行使，而文</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>學革命，决不能用非常手段所能辦到。第二種說法，雖較言之成理，而其實亦有些不確；近人祇看見外人的飛機，大砲，無綫電，死光等等，十分厲害；但是他們也經過許多科學家在試騐室長時間的研究試騐，而後成功，並不是像曹操請左慈吃飯一樣，要吃龍肝，龍肝就到，要吃四腮鱸，四腮鱸就到，要創造大衆語，恐不能像左慈先生那樣的容易？</p>
<p>主張大衆語的幾位作家，天然别有憂國憂民的心理，未必僅僅提出大衆語三字來欺騙大衆，欺騙文盲。但也須預先切實研究大衆語如何産生的方法，和産生後如何推行到大衆去，但自有大衆語三字以來，没有看見過一篇實地實動爲大衆語設計的文字，只是寫了隨着資本主義而産生的白話文而口喊大衆語的口號。</p>
<p>最可笑的，有一位先生，寫了幾句浦東土語，自命爲浦東大衆語，有一位先生，寫了幾句上海土語，便欣欣自命得意地說是上海大衆語，這種作品出來，眞是大倒文壇的霉，這種東西，我起初將爲反對大衆語而故意做出來搗蛋的，後來考察，方知乃是大衆語的忠實同志，眞是滑天下之大稽。</p>
<p>有的說，大衆語三字的産生，因爲文壇上幾位登龍之流，憂文言文有死灰復燃之勢、故索性創造一種大衆語來反抗，這無異一人生了大病，家中人不去請好好醫生來診治，而去請太保道士巫婆來捉妖降魔，同一愚戇。而一般蝦兵蟹將之徒，便麥柴管當了令箭似的，便摇旗呐喊，滿臺飛舞，而綸巾羽扇之流，便高踞城頭，掀髯顚頭大笑，可惜我非登龍之流，否則也來提倡一個小衆語，令一般蝦兵蟹將也來鼓噪一陣，呐喊一陣。</p>
<p>統一思想和統一言論，祇有用政治力量或政治手腕所用的方法，文壇上恐没有這樣的力量，這樣的權威，現在懷疑大衆語，或反對大衆語的人很多，而如華先生之流，並不拿理論來折服，或拿事實來說明，而用非笑的態度來欲控制一切，亦眞是無聊得很，可憐得很；我奉勸先生，不要戴了高帽子，穿上大紅袍，混在蝦兵蟹將隊裏，發喊鼓噪罷！</p>
<p>先生旣高踞文壇，自應該專門研究文學爲對象，應該有一些作家研究的態度，虚心容納各方面的意見，方才是對，不要擺出時代前進者的架子，大衆語專家的一付面孔，隨便譏笑他人，或漫駡他人。號稱文壇，並不是象上海的城隍廟，蘇州的玄廟觀一樣，專供江湖上賣拳頭或賣百草梨膏糖欺騙觀衆的塲所。</p>
<p>我所勸道的話，似乎十分反對大衆語，其實不然，因爲我這幾話，而能激起一般主張大衆語先生們的反省，拼命地把大衆語好好的研究起來，組織起來，果然有大衆語公佈實行的一天，則我的功勞，不在一般蝦兵蟹將之下，倘若大衆語而竟然流産，不能産生，則文壇上的空氣，也應該肅清一些，不要弄得這樣烟烏障氣，我敬告華先生，且慢笑我「心急」！　　｜完｜</p>

<p>心是憂鬱的。</p>
<p>池畔的白鵝，不顧黃沙的飛揚，追逐着。有時撲過我的脚跟，以爲是誰追蹤着我呢。偷偷的向四面窺望··鎖着一對山鹿的鐵籠··鐵沙椅上飄着幾葉片枯；池面打擾得像一顆不安定的心；九十天了，這是個長時間的記憶｜還有前面數着自家兒步伐底憂鬱的心。</p>

<p>— 匈牙利Ｍ·周凱作士衡譯</p>
<p>關於這點，她更責駡我了，駡我是一個小鵝而且告訴我不久我就會明白我的荒唐了；說了這些威嚇的話，她離開我了，我忙着預備跳舞的事，直忙到晚間才把一切準備好。照着那個軍官的建議，在腰部我繫了一條寛的紅白綠色的絲帶，頭上我只紥了一朶紅白色的薔薇花的花朶，再配上綠葉子，也就成了國色了。我從前總没有發見出這幾種顔色混合在一起是有多麽好。</p>
<p>兩個軍官十分喜悅地等候着，對我們說了那麽多的客氣話，我却想像不出他們怎麽學來的。我只得笑着掩飾了我的爲難。</p>
<p>「喔，你看着吧，這件事將以涙來收塲的，」媽媽說，但是她繼續着整理着我的衣服，換換這件，換換那件，好像是如果他們把我搶走，至少也使他們覺得一切是整齊的。</p>
<p>兩個軍官伴着我們到了舞廳，我已經愉快地想到我的國色的絲帶和我們的兩個翩翩少年將給與會塲上的影響，而且當我們走進來的時候，我還在想着如果全塲的人都是四方腦袋的，我們可以有兩個唯一的圓腦袋的人。</p>
<p>但是我的錯誤和驚訝是大極了。幾乎每一個我的女同伴們，至少也有像我那樣的兩條國色的絲帶，至於講到軍官，我們的兩個武士，在其中只能算是三流人物呢。一個賽一個地親切，魅人，漂亮而活潑　像這樣的人們怎麽會流出那麽多的血呢！</p>
<p>其中有一個特别地惹起了我的注目，不只我一個人，每一個人都是如此。他是一個青年隊長！他的動人的美麗的面孔和那高大優雅的姿態，是極其適合那鑲邊的軍服，那像是塑在他的身上似的。其次還有，他的跳舞！他是多麽有生氣的跳了馬扎舞和扎達舞！一個人會闖過人羣擁抱了他！這我不是說我自己。而且，比他的跳舞和他的慇懃更使人戀戀的，是他那迷迷的黑大的眼睛裏的純潔。不到一個鐘頭，這屋裏的每一個女兒都愛上他了。我並不除外我自己。如果他們在戰塲上是毫不顧忌的話，我不曉得有什麽人能夠抵抗他們。可是突然他邁步到我的面前，請我和他跳下一次四人舞，這時請你想像着我情感吧！</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The construction of the Japanese airfield in Balitai, Nankai, Tianjin, is progressing with increasing secrecy. A barbed wire fence has been erected around the construction site for half a li, prohibiting people from approaching to watch. More than 400 construction workers are actively working. Every day, 40 to 50 large carts with Japanese flags are loaded with wood and sand and transported to the site. A deputy consul from the Japanese embassy came to Tianjin to negotiate with the Tianjin Municipal Government, requesting that our side not cause trouble for the tenants and landlords, and claiming that the site was definitely not being built as an airfield. Therefore, the negotiations have stalled. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Yan Huiqing Passes Through Nanjing Heading North to Discuss Important International Issues <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>China Can be Re-elected as a Non-Permanent Member of the League of Nations</p>
<p>My Departure Date Will Be Determined After I Recover</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Yan Huiqing visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he returned to Nanjing from Xuncheng on the Lianhe Wheel on the 3rd. He arrived at the port at 11:30 AM on the 4th and went to Yan Deqing's residence to rest. In the afternoon, he visited President Wang Jingwei and reported on his trip to Lushan. He left for Shanghai that evening to go to Qingdao for recuperation. A Central News Agency reporter visited Yan on the morning of the 4th and asked about recent important international issues. According to him: (1) The Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is a very good phenomenon in the international community. In the past, the Soviet Union regarded the League of Nations as a group of imperialists, so it did not join. Now, because the League of Nations handles various matters fairly and maintains justice, although it has not been able to demonstrate its actual strength, it dares to speak frankly, so it is still considered a good organization in the international community. Moreover, no matter what, the power of those who stand alone outside the group is always too small, and it is inconvenient to deal with things. This is the reason why the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations. In addition, although there was some resistance to the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations, it was reported that two-thirds agreed, which could be passed. The League of Nations must have had considerable contact before putting forward this proposal, and there should be no problems. As for the Soviet Union's hope to serve as a permanent member of the Executive Council like other countries in the League of Nations, this is another matter. On the Soviet side, since it is a great power in modern times, it certainly hopes to be a permanent member. (2) The term of our country's non-permanent membership in the League of Nations has expired this time. I previously received a telegram from a friend in Geneva, saying that our country's situation is very good and that re-election is possible. As for the situation after Persia's recent request, it is not yet known. There are four non-permanent members of the League of Nations in Asia: China, Persia, Siam, and Turkey. Each country also takes turns serving. However, China now has more affairs with the League of Nations, and China's land and population are also the largest in Asia. It is estimated that there will be no problem with re-election. (3) According to reports, the situation between Japan and Russia seems very serious. As far as I know, Russia is working hard on its five-year plan and does not want to engage in war with foreign countries for the time being. However, if anyone invades it, it will definitely rise up to resist and make long-term defenses without a doubt. As for how the situation between Japan and Russia will change, it is still difficult to predict at this time. (4) I have not heard of rumors that Britain and Japan will restore their alliance. However, Britain and Japan were originally allies, but the treaty was terminated due to changes in the international community. A certain party benefited a lot from the alliance in the past. Once separated, it will naturally not forget its old friends and hope to renew the old joy. (5) After returning to China, I have met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek many times. This time, I went to Guling to accompany Minister Gu Weijun and did not have any missions. In Guling, in addition to meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, I also met with Huang Fu and talked briefly. Huang still needs to give a lecture on the mountain at Chiang's request, so he will have to wait a little longer to return north. (6) Because I am over 50 years old and have been abroad for more than 20 years, after returning to China, I asked Chiang and Wang to approve my retirement and appoint someone capable to take over. However, Chiang and Wang still ordered me to go. Because I am weak and still need to be treated, and my family affairs also need to be dealt with, and there are no major events abroad recently, I plan to determine the date of my departure after I recover. (7) I have no special events in Nanjing this time. I will report to the government authorities. I will leave Nanjing for Shanghai tonight and then go to Qingdao for recuperation. The reporter asked when Minister Gu Weijun would return to his post. He replied that Gu would fly from Beijing to Shanghai on the 3rd and then fly to Qingdao from Shanghai on the 4th. His wife is coming from abroad and has not yet arrived, so Gu has no definite date to return to his post in the near future. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing arrived in Nanjing at noon on the 4th on the Lianhe Wheel. Xu Mo and Yan Deqing and others went to Xiaguan to meet him. He first went to the No. 7 official residence of the Ministry of Railways to rest. Xu Mo and Ma Xier, a director of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, and others went to visit him. Yan visited Wang Jingwei at 3:00 PM to report on his trip to Jiangxi. In the afternoon, he crossed the Yangtze River and took the Jinpu train to Qingdao to give a lecture on international issues at the invitation of academic groups. Yan told reporters on the train that he had accompanied Minister Gu Weijun to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek this time. We stayed in Jiangxi for a total of three days and met with General Chiang three times. What we talked about were general situations in the international community. Although Chairman Chiang is a military officer, he is also very concerned about foreign affairs, so he inquired in detail about the situations in Russia and Poland. I am old and weak and have repeatedly asked to select someone capable to succeed me as ambassador to Russia, but I have not been allowed to do so. I also expressed my intention to resign this time, but Chairman Chiang still persuaded me to do my best. I have a heart disease, and whether I can return to my post depends on the results of the treatment. After giving a lecture in Qingdao, I will return to Tianjin for a short stay and then go to the Xiehe Hospital in Beiping in October for treatment. Minister Gu's wife is returning to China, so the date of his return to his post has not yet been determined. He and I went down from Guling on the morning of the 2nd. After arriving in Jiujiang, I took the wheel and he took the plane first. Mr. Gu will take a plane from Shanghai to Qingdao again on the 5th. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Kong Xiangxi Explains the Truth About the Silver Issue <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Government Has No Orders to Prohibit Exports or Increase Taxes</p>
<p>All Banks Have Very Sufficient Margin</p>
<p>The Silver Export Craze Has Subsided</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Executive Yuan meeting, Chu Minyi told reporters that Kong Xiangxi had not attended the Yuan meeting for many days because he had gone to Guling. Recently, there have been many rumors about silver exports, and various ministries and commissions have also been unclear about this issue. Therefore, when he attended the meeting today, he explained to the heads of the various ministries and commissions present the truth about the government's handling of the silver issue. According to his oral report to the heads of the various ministries and commissions, the government has no orders to prohibit the export of silver or increase export taxes. Everything is handled in accordance with established policies. Most of the silver that has been exported recently has been transported by foreign banks. For example, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has branches in both Shanghai and Hong Kong, so sometimes the Shanghai branch transports cash to Hong Kong. However, in this time of panic, it is easy to attract the attention of the general public. Our country has very sufficient margin for banks. If various ministries and commissions have any opinions on silver issues, they can consult him, etc. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles report that a small number of speculators in the Shanghai silver industry previously smuggled silver for export in an attempt to reap huge profits. Because the quantity was limited and our country had a large amount of silver reserves, it did not have any impact. Now that London gold prices are rising and silver prices are falling, speculators have no profit to be made. In addition, the authorities have no intention of prohibiting silver exports or levying silver export taxes. The silver export craze has now subsided. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Trade Import Surplus and Rural Economy Respectfully <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>From January to July of this year, the import items of our country's foreign trade totaled 641,107,800 yuan. Export items amounted to 303,455,800 yuan. Subtracting exports from imports, the import surplus was 337,670,000 yuan. At a time when the country is impoverished and the people are poor, it is truly alarming that the import surplus has reached such a huge amount in just seven months. Our country's foreign trade originally lacked the power of autonomy. During the era when gold was expensive and silver was cheap, the price of silver foreign exchange was relatively low, and export trade was in a more favorable position. However, it was still obstructed by the tariff barriers of various countries and could not find its way in. Conversely, the import of high-priced foreign goods was only subject to natural restrictions in the market and did not show any significant decline. Since 1931, countries such as Britain and Japan have successively abandoned the gold standard. With lower currency prices, exports became easier, and goods were dumped in a torrent. This is undoubtedly the main reason for the huge import surplus in recent years. As for our country's export side, the trade of soybeans and soybean cakes from the three northeastern provinces, which originally amounted to more than 200 million taels, has now been entirely seized by others. The export of raw silk is less than one-third of its peak, and the tea industry is also declining significantly. The sluggishness of foreign trade can be seen from this. Amidst the global economic panic, all countries in the world are making every effort to stimulate the increase in exports and encourage the reduction in imports. Only our country lacks competitiveness and has no economic policy, resulting in it sacrificing itself for others and forming today's perilous situation. In addition to foreign trade, the repayment of principal and interest on foreign debts is also a considerable amount. Furthermore, the total amount of investment by various countries in China is 4 billion US dollars. At an interest rate of 8%, the annual extraction is also more than 320 million US dollars. With such continuous exploitation to fill an endless abyss, no matter how hardworking and enduring the people of our country are, there will inevitably be a day when they are exhausted.</p>
<p>In the past, what could be used to balance our country's international balance of payments, in addition to special products such as soybeans, was remittances from overseas Chinese, which was sufficient to supplement it. At first glance, this type of intangible import does not seem to have much to do with the overall national economy, but it is not known that it is actually very beneficial to the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. However, in recent years, the so-called economic nationalism and narrow-minded nationalism have become prevalent in various countries. Overseas Chinese operating abroad have been subjected to political suppression by the countries of residence and have also encountered economic misfortunes. Not only do the laboring people below the middle class feel the darkness of the future, but even wealthy property owners feel the uncertainty of the future. If this continues, I am afraid that the achievements of the hard work of overseas Chinese in the past will be completely eliminated, and the country's intangible income will also decline significantly. What will be used to fill this huge gap in the future is something that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The impact of the trade import surplus on the rural economy is real. Moreover, our country's agriculture has not yet escaped the confines of manual production. Therefore, both the bounty of heaven and labor are equally important, and neither can be lacking. Once a natural disaster or man-made destruction occurs, it takes a considerable amount of time to recover. Since the development of modern capitalism, our country's entire economy has been manipulated by it. The countryside suffers from double exploitation, and the suffering is unspeakable. Various countries have reduced the value of their currencies and implemented inflation. The relative increase in the value of our country's silver coins naturally leads to a relative drop in prices. Emerging industries in cities and rural people are both inevitably困交 by it. The production of goods is not enough to cover wage expenses, and there is a risk of delayed sales abroad. Raw silk and tea are clear examples of this.</p>
<p>Under this stage, even a bumper harvest of grains and rice can become a disaster. The example of last year is still fresh in our minds. This year, floods and droughts are rampant, and agricultural production is even more severely affected. Even the minimum standard of living cannot be guaranteed, let alone anything else. The result of rural decline will inevitably lead to the collapse of the entire economic system, which is to be expected. Now, the matter is becoming increasingly urgent and cannot be delayed any longer. Can the people of the country not rise up quickly to jointly save this economic crisis?</p>
<h3 id="e18">The Situation of the Great Strike in the American Textile Industry <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Response is Very Consistent</p>
<p>The Garment Industry is Also Unstable</p>
<p>(Washington) Textile capitalists declared that the response to the strike was very small. Gorman, the vice president of the American Textile Workers Union, made a special statement today, saying that 50% of the workers had already gone on strike, and that the cooperative attitude of the workers was beyond expectations. Even the union authorities were very surprised. However, today is Labor Day, which was originally a holiday, so both labor and capital have their own arguments, and it is difficult to determine the truth. Riots have occurred. For example, in Wangshan, North Carolina, workers prevented the factory from hiring new workers to start work, which caused disturbances. According to an Associated Press survey, the response to the strike was very inconsistent. Although the union claimed that at least 600,000 workers had gone on strike,</p>
<p>Slone, the president of the Cotton Textile Association, issued a statement in New York saying that the workers in the South did not respond. This statement has been denied by the union. However, there is indeed disagreement within the workers. Some factories continued to operate as usual even on today's holiday. From the overall situation, it seems that this strike cannot completely shut down the textile industry. President Roosevelt was picnicking in the countryside with his family in Hyde Park today, but he paid close attention to the labor movement. The strike movement in the garment industry is also about to materialize. The labor unrest became more tense today. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in Chicago claimed that the union would soon make its final demand. If the capitalists cannot accept the president's order to reduce the working week to 36 hours, they will announce a general strike of 200,000 people. However, the capitalists had already notified the president that they could not comply with the order, so the strike seems unavoidable. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Labor and capital have different opinions on the effectiveness of the textile strike. Slone, the president of the Textile Association, said today that according to reports from the southern states, 90% of the cotton mill workers in the southern states who did not participate in the Labor Day celebrations are working as usual. However, Gorman, the chairman of the strike committee, said that more than a dozen cotton mills in the South had workers on strike across the board, and it is expected that the number of strikers will increase from 85% to 90% around September 8. A telegram from Carolina stated that 60,000 textile workers are currently unemployed, and 200 cotton mills have closed down. However, the other 200 cotton mills employ 75,000 workers who are still working. The cotton mills in the other 24 states employ a total of 500,000 workers, who are off work today for Labor Day. According to news from Wangshan, North Carolina, 900 workers employed by the three cotton mills there were forcibly dispersed by members of the Automobile Workers Union today. The Automobile Workers have declared a strike to express their sympathy with the textile workers, and are now invading other cotton mills, trying to close down all 11 cotton mills there. The largest cotton mill in Boncharara, North Carolina, was guarded by special police with weapons this morning during the shift change to prevent riots. (3rd Reuters)</p>

<p>Persia's Campaign is Too Overconfident</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo Set Off for Geneva</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, our Minister to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, will attend the 15th session of the League of Nations General Assembly on the 12th of this month and departed from London for Geneva on the 3rd. Jin Wensi and Luo Zhongyi will also depart from the Netherlands and Sweden respectively on the same day to go to Switzerland. It is heard that Persia intends to compete with us for a seat on the Council. Therefore, after Ambassador Guo arrives in Geneva, he will publish an article in his capacity as the chief representative of our country to the League of Nations General Assembly, explaining our position on our country's election as a non-permanent member of the Council. Although Guo did not report this matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in advance, it is based on the government's intention. It is expected that our country, due to special circumstances, still has hope of being re-elected as a non-permanent member of the League of Nations Council. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e20">The Soviet Union's Accession is Beneficial to World Peace <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Paris Public Opinion Unanimously Supports</p>
<p>Switzerland's Opposition Does Not Harm the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Paris) The move of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations has been supported by both the conservative "Le Figaro" and the radical "Le Siècle Nouveau". "Le Figaro" stated that the Soviet Union's accession has three benefits: (1) The Soviet Union has a population of 160 million, and its army is very well-trained. Its air force has become one of the best in Europe. If it joins the League of Nations, it will add considerable weight to the League of Nations. (2) When Germany withdrew from Geneva, it thought it could control the League of Nations' fate. Now, seeing the Soviet Union's accession, it will regret its reckless behavior. (3) The Soviet Union's accession is to restore its previous position in European diplomacy. European countries should discuss with the Soviet Union on the same stage instead of listening to it behind the scenes. "Le Siècle Nouveau" said, "Countries that join the League of Nations must be happy to abide by the general rules of the League of Nations. Any country that holds this idea and is willing to jointly abide by moral rules, the more there is in the League of Nations, the more peace can be consolidated, and the sovereignty and independence of all nations will be more respected." (4th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Swiss government decided to vote against the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations when the League of Nations General Assembly votes on the issue. The Daily People's Voice commented on this matter, believing that Switzerland's opposition is inappropriate. The newspaper said that this move is "stupid and hateful," and continued that Switzerland's opposition will not harm either the Soviet Union or the League of Nations. The only one affected is the Swiss government itself. The headquarters of the League of Nations is located in Switzerland, but the Swiss government does not understand the friendship of the host at all. Will people all over the world not deeply regret the mistaken choice of the League of Nations' headquarters? (4th Havas)</p>

<p>The Reason is the Fear of Communist Activities</p>
<p>⊙Capital of Switzerland The Federal Executive Council recently unanimously decided that the Swiss delegation to the League of Nations General Assembly should vote against the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations when voting on the issue. (4th Havas)</p>
<p>⊙Capital of Switzerland The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federal Executive Council held a meeting yesterday and proposed that the Swiss delegation to the League of Nations General Assembly should clearly reject the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations. The local newspapers all expressed their support for this decision. The "Evening News" said that if the Swiss representative voted in favor, it would be tantamount to indirectly recognizing the Soviet Union, but Switzerland has never recognized the Soviet Union. The "Geneva Daily News" stated that this proposal of the Foreign Affairs Committee was sent to the newspapers for publication before being submitted to the Executive Council for approval, which is not in accordance with usual practice, which proves that the government intends to immediately seek public opinion to make a final decision. All newspapers stated that the Federal Executive Council will hold a meeting today, and all members will attend and unanimously pass this proposal. (4th Reuters)</p>
<p>⊙Capital of Switzerland The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Swiss Federal Parliament and the Swiss delegation to the League of Nations held a meeting today and resolved to apply to Parliament to vote against the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations. It is heard that the reason is that they are deeply afraid that communist activities will increase as a result. It is also heard that Persia is opposed to the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations, but it is believed that it will not actually reject the proposal for the Soviet Union's accession.

<h3 id="e26">Japanese Ambassador Ota Proposes to Russia to Withdraw Troops from the Border <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Exploration Nature, Russia's Attitude is Worth Noting</p>
<p>(Paris) Japanese Ambassador to Russia Ota visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov (in charge of Far Eastern affairs) on the 31st of last month, explaining his personal opinion that in order to ease the situation in the Far East, the Japanese and Russian troops stationed on the Far Eastern border should be withdrawn immediately. The ambassador visited Stomonyakov again yesterday and suggested dismantling defensive fortifications. According to the Little Paris Daily, Ota's suggestion to the Soviet Russian government in his personal capacity is of great concern to foreign figures stationed in Moscow, as it is generally believed that Ota's visit is a preliminary exploration and a preparation for formal diplomatic negotiations. There is no doubt that this kind of proposal is extremely sensitive. If Russia rejects this proposal, Japan has an excuse to say that Russia refuses to try to ease the tense situation in the Far East. If Russia accepts this proposal, then the real beneficiary is Japan, because it is easy for Japan to withdraw its troops stationed in Manchuria. On the contrary, the defensive fortifications in Vladivostok and the coastal provinces are relied on by the Russian Red Army and cannot be easily abolished. The Little Paris Daily believes that it is difficult to determine at this time whether Ota's proposal can be accepted by Moscow. (4th Havas)</p>

<p>Arresting Employees Said to be False National Legal Rights</p>
<p>Night Trains Suspended on the Southern Section of the Middle East Railway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the case of arresting Soviet employees of the Eastern Railway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 7 pm on the 4th, received a written letter from Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev to Foreign Minister Hirota on August 20. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota also replied to the Soviet ambassador in writing on September 4. The full text of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is as follows: Dear Sir, I have received your letter of August 22 regarding the case of arresting Soviet bureau members on the Eastern Section of the Eastern Railway on August 13, 14, and 16. After investigation, in recent months, there have been repeated conspiracies to overturn military trains in various places on the Eastern Section of the railway. Therefore, "Manchukuo" exercised its judicial power, and its basis is nothing more than this. As for the aforementioned case of overturning trains, the Japanese Ministry of the Army has not published any statement. As you said, the Japanese government should not be responsible for the various news published in the Japanese newspapers. There is no need to discuss this. On the Soviet side, it is said that the overturned trains in this case were only the actions of the local rebels, and even made a big statement, saying that the case was deliberately delayed by the Japanese and Manchurian sides and used this means, etc. On the Japanese and Manchurian sides, who are responsible for the defense of "Manchukuo," may I ask why they attempted to overturn military trains on the Eastern Railway? As for the point that there was no robbery, it cannot be regarded as the action of ordinary rebels. This can prove that (omitted)... Regarding the overturning of military vehicles and other similar incidents that disrupt public order in North Manchuria, since this week, the majority of Soviet personnel have been arrested at any time. The Soviet government believes that this should have been dealt with long ago, but the recent arrest seems to be related to the suspension of negotiations on the Eastern Railway. It also believes that damaging railway operations infringes on the Soviet Union's rights under the Eastern Railway Treaty. We believe that your government's view is entirely a false accusation. Therefore, we must point out that this kind of judicial event is absolutely necessary to ensure railway transportation and maintain public order along the line. Even if negotiations on the Middle East Railway have not been suspended, it is of course possible to launch it. (omitted) In short, the Japanese government is very concerned about where the aforementioned conspiracy comes from. As for the derailment incident related to this case, its location is limited to the Eastern Section of the railway, and most of the damaged trains are transportation trains for military supplies, and the supplies have not been robbed, and the victims are mainly Japanese and Manchurian people, with no Soviet people being harmed. This is completely different from the situation of ordinary train damage. As for the detainees this time, all of them are Soviet employees of the Eastern Section of the Eastern Railway and have all participated in this illegal society that disrupts the public order of "Manchukuo" and plots irregularities. The instructions issued by the rebels to blow up the railway and the supply of explosives are all handled by the Soviet employees of the railway. According to this report and various other circumstances, it seems that a part of the Soviet people have some connection with the plan in this case, and it can be said that this view is a natural trend. (4th Japanese United Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A telegram from Harbin stated that the Middle East Railway Administration had inquired with the Chief of Staff of the Railway Protection Army about the safety situation of the railway's southern section, but the headquarters of the Railway Protection Army did not respond. Subsequently, the Director of the Railway Administration, Rodi, ordered the suspension of night trains on the southern section. According to news from Bo Li, the Harbin press is using the recent train robbery on the southern section of the Middle East Railway to carry out its new anti-Soviet rumors, falsely claiming that a Soviet train attendant is colluding with bandits. At the same time, when listing the names of those who were harmed during the bandit attack, they were silent about the temporary serious injury of the Soviet train attendant Trebupengko. The Japanese and Manchurian press are trying to use these rumors to instigate an anti-Soviet campaign among the Soviet railway workers of the Middle East Railway, strongly accusing them of being related to the bandits who robbed the train.

<p>Student and Worker Strikes and Demonstrations</p>
<p>⊙Havana:  For several weeks, the Cuban capital has been in turmoil. Today, students and workers launched a 24-hour strike to protest the deaths of two young men on Saturday. The presidential guard discovered the two young men hiding weapons, intending to break into the presidential palace. When their plot was exposed, they failed to escape and were shot dead by the guards. Agitators exaggerated the incident, claiming the two men were martyrs who sacrificed themselves for Cuban freedom, and delivered speeches to workers in the streets and alleys, inciting students.  Thus, a general strike suddenly erupted, catching the authorities completely unprepared. Transportation has been temporarily disrupted. However, troops were ordered to patrol all roads, and in a short time, the agitators scattered throughout the city were cleared. Several demonstrators were injured during the clashes.

<p>Differing Views from All Sides</p>
<p>Neutrality is Legally Impossible</p>
<p>(London)  Whether the British mainland would naturally involve the dominions in war if it went to war with a foreign power is a question on which opinions differ greatly.  A speech by South African Prime Minister Hertzog on this matter has attracted considerable attention.  Hertzog stated that if the British mainland went to war because of a treaty to which the dominions had not explicitly acceded, the dominions would not bear any responsibility.  The Locarno Treaty was one such example.  Conversely, according to the most reliable sources, the Liberal Party, which is about to form a cabinet in Canada, has explicitly declared, "When Britain goes to war, Canada goes to war."  When Sir Maurice Hankey, a member of the Imperial Defence Committee, visited the capitals of the various colonies of the Empire to discuss defense, the issue of the relationship between the dominions and the mother country was particularly important.  Responsible parties in London believe that sovereignty in the British Empire belongs to the British mainland. If the mainland goes to war and a part of the Empire declares neutrality, it is legally impossible.  However, this is only a matter of principle.  Whether the dominions must actively participate in any war that the British mainland is involved in, regardless of the circumstances, has not been explained in detail by the speakers. (Note: Sir Maurice Hankey, a member of the Imperial Defence Committee, went to Australia in early August to participate in the centenary of the establishment of the state of Victoria.  He took the opportunity to visit the capitals of various dominions to consult on imperial defense. See the telegram of August 8.)  (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) At 1:30 PM on the 4th, the Tokyo Transportation Labor Union issued the following statement regarding the general strike, requesting the understanding of the general public:  "The Tokyo Electric Bureau's dismissal of 11,000 employees and reduction of wages by half is an unreasonable act by capitalists. This is not only a problem for our Electric Bureau employees, but also a major problem for all laborers and salaried workers. We sent representatives to demand that the company authorities withdraw the reorganization plan, but they were rejected. We have now decided to launch a general strike on the morning of September 5 to fight against this.  We hereby announce this." (4th Rengo Telegram)</p>

<p>Local Recruitment Limited to 300 People</p>
<p>⊙Saarbrücken: The Saar Administrative Commission is strengthening its police force to maintain order during the plebiscite in January next year. In addition to requesting the League of Nations to recruit neutral police, it is specifically recruiting 300 Saarlanders for preliminary training. The first batch of 100 people has already been recruited, the second batch of 100 will be recruited after the 15th, and the remaining 100 will be recruited one month later. It is generally believed that the number of newly recruited Saarland police for use during the voting period will be limited to 300 and will not be exceeded. Therefore, a number of people still need to be recruited from foreign countries to supplement them. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) On August 17, the Saar Administrative Commission sent a letter to the League of Nations requesting the recruitment of neutral police to maintain order during the plebiscite. The letter stated, "The Commission will, to the extent possible, recruit police and gendarmes from the residents of Saarland to supplement the existing police. However, recruitment from foreign countries is essential."

<p>Disagreement on Credit Extension Terms</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources obtained by the Associated Press today, the obstacle to US-Russia debt negotiations is the disagreement over the nature of future credit extensions from the United States to Soviet Russia. In recent negotiations between the two countries on the debt issue, there has been complete understanding on both sides. Russian sources here deny that there are any difficulties regarding the total amount of repayment. It is heard that the negotiations between Secretary of State Hull and Russian Ambassador Troyanovsky have made great progress, but there is still no agreement on the issue of future credit extensions. The American business community is paying close attention to these negotiations because once the debt is resolved, Soviet Russia can place orders in the United States. Currently, because Soviet Russia is on the list of debtor nations, it cannot enjoy credit extensions in the United States under the Johnson Act. (3rd National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>68-Year-Old Evangeline Booth Elected</p>
<p>(London) Evangeline Booth, daughter of the founder of the Salvation Army, was elected today to succeed Higgins as Commander-in-Chief. Ms. Booth, nearly 70 years old, has devoted her entire life to the work of the Salvation Army. In her youth, she personally participated in humble work while serving the poor, and was soon known as the "White Angel." Ms. Booth later went from England to Canada to lead the work there for eight years, establishing many schools, hospitals, and libraries. In 1904, she was elected commander of the Salvation Army in the United States. In the United States, she founded more than 1,600 educational institutions, nursing homes, and worker shelters. There were also opponents of her election as Commander-in-Chief this time, claiming that she had too much secular念 in the United States and that she was already sixty-eight years old. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Salvation Army's High Council today appointed Evangeline Booth, daughter of the founder of the Salvation Army, as the new commander of the Salvation Army, replacing Higgins, who will retire due to old age on November 10. It has been eight years since the Booth family last held this position, and this is the first time that a woman has held this top position, a groundbreaking event in the Salvation Army. Eight years ago, when Higgins was elected, Ms. Booth was also one of the candidates. Ms. Booth has 40 years of service in the Salvation Army, and for the past 30 years, she has been the leader of the Salvation Army in the United States. Although she is now 69 years old, she swims every morning and takes long walks or drives in the afternoon, which is her usual routine. In 1898, during the Klondike gold rush, Ms. Booth led a Salvation Army nursing corps to rescue the injured. The High Council declared after the election today that Ms. Booth's election was a sign of Providence. The entire council expressed its admiration for Higgins's contributions and swore allegiance to the new commander. It also stated that the organization of the Salvation Army will remain the same. A total of five candidates were nominated by the High Council today, including another woman, the daughter of the late General Bramwell Booth, who is also the niece of the new commander, Ms. Evangeline Booth. When the new commander left the election hall, the crowd outside cheered. It is said that the vote count will not be released. The new commander's annual salary is 500 English pounds, which does not come from the Salvation Army's funds, but is allocated from a special trust fund established by the late General Booth Boothby.

<p>(Berlin) Dr. Behrle, of the Dalen National Medical Association, announced today that he has discovered a tumor germ. He said that he discovered the germ under a microscope. He cultured the germ and injected it into animals. Soon after, the animals showed signs of tumors. Then, he re-cultured the tumor germ in these animals. The reason he was unable to discover it earlier was that the germ nests were extremely close to red blood cells, and it was necessary to use "special injection and analysis" to see the germ. Tumors only develop in people with alkaline blood. The tumor germ goes through seven stages, the first four of which are present even in healthy people. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Telegram from Changyuan to the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper, requesting transmission to the Chairmen and Directors of various provincial and charity organizations:</p>
<p>Heaven has sent a severe calamity, and the River God is raging again. Waves surge and crash, breaching dikes and breaking defenses. The aftermath of the calamity of Guiyou (1933) has not yet subsided, and the devastation of Jiashu (this year) is reported again. After the pain subsides, we cannot bear to weep again for the sake of the people. We humbly report that the river water began to rise on the 10th of this month, and by the morning of the 12th, mountain floods arrived, compounded by autumn rains, suddenly reaching heights of over ten feet in an instant. The Nine Branch Road, Liaoqiang Village, Xiangli Zhang, and others on the west bank were breached successively on the same day. The turbulent waves followed the old course, and by the morning of the 14th, the old districts one, two, three, and five, as well as the eastern half of district four, were once again inundated, with depths ranging from six to seven feet, four to five feet, three to four feet, and two to three feet. No house was left standing, and the sound was like thunder, gunfire, and the roar of the sea. The county seat was fortunately in the center of the flood, and in one day and night, the surrounding area rose to a depth of four to five feet, soaking the cracks from previous years. If it were not for diligent care, the city would have been breached. Therefore, although this flood is less turbulent than last year's, the crops are food for the fish and shrimp, and the courtyards are full of pits and valleys, even more so than before. The cries of sorrow, the sound of water, the roars of beasts, and the calls of birds, with the long autumn waters and the sky above and below the hills, the autumn of Jiashu is no different from Guiyou. Alas, homes are empty, the fields are a watery realm, there are no reserves, and the poor die in ditches. This is what is meant by empty barns. Great inundations occur repeatedly, and plagues follow, increasing deaths. This is what is meant by an empty population. If the people do not survive, what is the use of taxes? If taxes are not collected, how can there be催科? This is what is meant by an empty treasury. Relief for the dead is insufficient, so there is no time to manage rites. The scholars are reduced to beggars. This is what is meant by empty schools. These are the four emptinesses. Years of great floods fill the sky with gloom. Even if we wait for the waters to recede, how long will life last? This is what is meant by exhausted land. Those who have fled have not returned, and their fate is unknown. Those who remain flee again, but there is no land. This is what is meant by exhausted talent. Dikes are blocked and built, and the great work is just being completed, but before three seasons have passed, the flood returns.抚字督科 is extinguished. This is what is meant by exhausted official power. These are the three exhaustiones.</p>
<p>Considering that Changyuan is located in Kuangpu, dividing fields in Dongbi, and has been established as a county for two thousand years, those who live there are guilty and suffer the wrath of heaven. But why should the wise men of the past suffer such hardship? We ask that those who hold power and those who govern the borders not sit idly by and watch the entire county be destroyed. Therefore, we dare to speak again before you, pleading for compassion and prompt relief, so that the coming years will be filled with your kindness and virtue. We express our gratitude, and the sound of our voices is hoarse. We cannot bear the urgent pressure of hunger and cold.</p>

<p>Order from the National Government on the 4th:</p>

<p>= Japan Actively Preparing =</p>
<p>= Soviet Union Standing Ready =</p>
<p>Since Japan occupied our four northeastern provinces, it has had two very clear military objectives. One is to take advantage of the situation and advance north, incorporating the area east of Lake Baikal into its territory, thereby gaining access to the oil in the northern part of Sakhalin Island and the benefits of the Siberian forests. The other is to take advantage of the victory and advance south and west, seizing the origins of wool and cotton production to serve as the base for its light industry. Previously, it did not know how much military force would be required to advance south and west, or how much money it would cost, so it did not dare to act lightly. Now that it has occupied Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe for nearly three years, it has a clearer understanding of the military realities, realizing that entering the pass is not very difficult, and advancing west is also very easy. This would not require much military force but would yield substantial benefits. Therefore, in terms of advancing south and west, it is not paying much attention to military deployments, only preparing some strength to cope with contingencies.</p>
<p>However, it is very active in terms of advancing north, because Japan needs to prepare for naval warfare in the Pacific, so oil is particularly important. It wants to use its army to seize oil resources in one fell swoop, so it has to make particularly intensive military deployments in northern Manchuria. First, along the Greater Khingan Mountains, it has built steel-reinforced concrete fortresses using cement and concrete. Many mountains with sparse human habitation are guarded by sentries, and hunting is prohibited. At the same time, the railway from Japan, crossing the sea from Tsuruga to Chongjin, crossing the Korean border, crossing the Tumen River, and reaching Changchun, has been completed. The railways from Changchun to Tao'an, from Huaiyuan to Solun, and from Erzhan to Heihe in Heilongjiang will probably also be completed after the autumn of this year. These are all military preparations. In addition, there is also the construction of automobile roads. The roads that have already been completed are over 2,500 kilometers long, and they are all spread out towards the northern border.</p>
<p>The construction of the Japanese air force, taking into account the four northeastern provinces, has more than fifty airfields. Almost forty of them are north of Liaoning, and the rest are scattered in southwestern Liaoning and the Rehe area.</p>
<p>Within the northeastern territory, there are five entire Japanese divisions, as well as special forces, cavalry, artillery, flying squadrons, tank squadrons, etc., totaling no less than 130,000 troops. In addition, there are two brigades of White Russian troops, 110,000 puppet troops, about 400 aircraft, and one tank regiment, and most of them are concentrated along the Chinese Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>In view of this threat, the Soviet Union will certainly not allow itself to be defenseless. So, the first step is to build defensive artillery forts and construct permanent trenches along the Heilongjiang and Ussuri rivers to cope with the above-mentioned military threats. At the same time, it is even clearer that the inconvenient transportation east of the Ural Mountains makes it difficult to concentrate huge forces and to transport supplies. This was the biggest factor in Russia's losses in the Russo-Japanese War. Now the Soviet authorities are well aware of this point, so the construction of a double-track railway alongside the Siberian Railway has already begun, and it should be completed in about a year.</p>
<p>Currently, the Soviet Union is gathering the Nineteenth Assault Army Corps in the vicinity of Vladivostok and Nikolayevsk. It includes eight</p>

The market situation stabilized before noon, rising 5 points at 10:30, but falling back by 1 point at 10:40.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: The wheat market opened at a price of 1.5 to 1.375 points lower due to retail sales. The textile industry strike also had a disturbing impact. Recent prices have risen by 1.25 to 2.5 points.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: In the Liverpool wheat market, the price for the October contract was 5 shillings and 7.375 pence at 1:00 PM today, down 0.75 from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: In the Liverpool cotton market, the price for the October contract was 6.86, up 1 point from yesterday's closing price.</p>

<p>London: The rubber market was stable this morning. The trading price for the October and December contracts at noon was 7.5625 pence, up 0.0625 from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: The New York rubber opening price fell, ranging from 14 to 17 points, due to the textile industry strike. At 10:20, the market price rebounded, rising 2 points, but the price at 10:40 fell by 3 to 7 points.</p>

<p>New York: Before the opening of the stock market, factors favorable to the market included reports from the steel industry stating that the number of orders received by steel mills in the past week had slightly increased. It was predicted that demand would pick up somewhat within the month, facilitating a turnaround in the autumn. Factors unfavorable to the market included the anticipation that industrial activity across various sectors would continue to decline this week due to holiday closures. When the stock market opened this morning, market conditions were loose, and the prices of various stocks mostly declined slightly. Hopes for an early recovery in commerce have been extinguished by the textile industry strike. Therefore, the market appears to remain lackluster and uncertain. Attached below are the New York stock market prices:</p>

<p>In Hailanpao there is a regiment of shock political security team, and a cavalry political security team, and Nigolisk also has a regiment of the same nature.</p>
<p>From Chita to Boli, there is the 18th Soviet Assault Army, which includes nine assault regiments, seven cavalry regiments, one Mongolian cavalry battalion, 60 aircraft, 120 cannons, three tank teams, 15 armored vehicles, one chemical warfare battalion, and one political security regiment.</p>
<p>According to a military expert's speculation, the total number of Soviet troops is about ten infantry divisions, two cavalry divisions, nine political security regiments, and about 200,000 soldiers, 500 aircraft, including 30 to 40 heavy bombers, with a range of more than 3,000 kilometers, while the distance between Tokyo, Osaka, and Vladivostok is only 1,100 kilometers, and round-trip flights are very easy.</p>
<p>Although the two sides, the Soviet Union and Japan, are so closely watching each other, they cannot start a war for a while due to economic constraints, but it is dangerous after all. Although there is no need to ignite it immediately, they are all adding gunpowder to it. (August 24)</p>
<h3 id="e108">Promotion of Shanghai and Hong Kong National Goods and Industrial Products in Southeast Asia <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Representatives Bring Samples for Exhibition at the Singapore Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Singapore Special Correspondent: Mr. Ma Yanzhang, a national goods promoter dispatched by the Shanghai industrial sector, accompanied by an American Mr. Erbo, carrying letters of introduction from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and the Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, arrived in the south on the President Polk. They arrived here from the Philippines yesterday morning and stayed at the Myriad Hotel. After arriving, the two gentlemen immediately visited the local Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, claiming that this trip was to represent Chinese national goods manufacturers in Shanghai to promote national goods in Southeast Asia, and brought seven large boxes of Chinese industrial products, totaling more than 200 kinds of samples, intending to exhibit them in various parts of Southeast Asia and engage in promotion. It is said that their trip to the south started on July 25 in Shanghai. They first went to Hong Kong, where they received enthusiastic support from Mr. Ma Wenhui of the Sincere Company, who also helped to collect more than 70 kinds of samples of products from Chinese factories in Hong Kong, which were also brought south. Therefore, the more than 200 kinds of samples brought by the two gentlemen this time represent the products of 97 Hong Kong and Shanghai national goods factories. The main products, such as silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, cosmetics, canned food, toys, shoes, socks, hats, light bulbs, electric fans, raincoats, medicines, lacquerware, tennis rackets, leather suitcases, curtain cloth, door curtain cloth, and other daily necessities, are all of excellent quality and rarely seen here. Mr. Ma and Mr. He held a reception for newspaper reporters at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating their intentions, saying that China's national goods industry has developed extremely rapidly in recent years due to the influence of expensive gold and cheap silver, but most of them are still in the budding stage and have not yet been able to produce on a large scale, and lack the ability to directly promote them abroad. American businessman Mr. Spike founded a Chinese industrial product export company, specializing in acting as an agent for the export and promotion of various industrial products in China. Since its establishment, the company has been highly reputable and highly praised by national goods merchants in major domestic ports. Recently, in view of the fact that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are very happy to use national goods, but due to the lack of publicity and the lack of intermediary agencies to introduce them, the excellent products produced by Chinese manufacturers have not been noticed by overseas Chinese, and it is not easy for foreigners to recognize them, making the world's great market a place for Japanese goods to gallop, which is very regrettable. The purpose of our trip to the south is to introduce and promote the excellence of our Chinese products and do our best to promote them. Mr. Ma also said that this trip was originally from Shanghai to Hong Kong by Mr. Shi Xianchen and others. Later, Mr. Shi and others returned to Shanghai due to business, and he accompanied Mr. He from Hong Kong to the Philippines. In Manila, Philippines, he exhibited the samples he brought for many days and engaged in promotion. Everywhere he went, he was enthusiastically welcomed by the Chinese businessmen, and after visiting, they ordered goods from him one after another, and the number of letters from the company to the factories in Shanghai and Hong Kong to purchase them was very large. It can be seen that the overseas Chinese love to use national goods. Mr. Ma and Mr. He plan to stay in Singapore for a few days, and are scheduled to publicly display the more than 200 kinds of samples they brought at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce starting on August 28. After the exhibition in Singapore, they will take the road to Penang, and then to Bangkok, Siam, and then to Calcutta, India, and Batavia and Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies, and to other parts of Southeast Asia. It is estimated that the trip will take three months, and they will be able to return to Shanghai around November of this year. (August 27)</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Three Route Army Captures Yiqian <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>—The City of Shicheng County Will Be Captured Soon—</p>
<p>—The Red Bandits of Ningdu Are Surrounded—</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: When the Red Bandits broke through from the border of Fujian and Jiangxi to disturb the Minjiang River and invade eastern Fujian, a part of the Pseudo Third Army Corps Peng Dehuai and the Pseudo Fifth Army Corps Dong Zhentang were distributed in Shicheng, Ningdu, and Xingguo. The Pseudo Central Directly Subordinate Troops of Ye Jianying were holding on north of Huichang Yunmenling. The bandit troops of the Pseudo First Army Corps Lin Biao and others were scattered in the area of Changting and Ninghua in western Fujian, containing the East Route Army attacking Tingzhou, and another group of bandits from the Pseudo Seventh and Ninth Army Corps Fang Zhimin and Luo Binghui sneaked eastward, hoping to attack the unprepared National Army. Regarding the Sixth Division of the Pseudo Third Army Corps, which was holding on to Xingguo, it was repeatedly repelled by Zhou Hunyuan and reached Gaoxingxu. There are no major battles with the bandits guarding Ningdu because they are not the main force. A part of the Pseudo 35th Army Corps, which stubbornly defended Shicheng, was repeatedly attacked by the National Army, which was 口⼝⼝ advancing step by step, in the area south of Baishui and Xueheling. The Red Bandits seized Yiqian, which is located at the junction of Shicheng, Jiangxi, eastern Jiangxi, southern Jiangxi, western Fujian, and northern Fujian, and is essential for both military and economic reasons. Zhu Mao once sent a large number of bandits to garrison there, and transferred two to three thousand farmers, young and old, from 寗瑞　Hui to gather in Huangshimen to supplement the bandit army and drive them to withstand the artillery fire. Starting on the 28th of last month, the National Army launched an attack on various routes and occupied the bandit positions. In another battle until 1:00 PM, the key points of Nanlingnao and Huangtumen north of Yiqian were also captured by the central route. The regiment commander of the Pseudo Fourth Division and the battalion commander of the third battalion of the regiment were killed in battle, and many bandit soldiers were killed or wounded. The bandit forces were unsustainable, and the National Army was encouraged to continue the attack, and completely recovered Yiqian on the 29th. The remnants of the bandits retreated completely to the vicinity of Shicheng County. It was found that Yiqian was the gateway to Shicheng and also the key to Ningdu. It is only tens of miles away from Shicheng County. Now that it is owned by the National Army, Shicheng is like something in a pocket, and the northern half of Ningdu protrudes between Guangchang and Yongfeng, and has long been surrounded. Its southern half protrudes south of Shicheng Xingguo. Now that the ⼝⼝ and other route armies have captured Shixing, they have been very successful. If these two counties are captured, the bandits in Ningdu will have nowhere to go if they do not escape. (September 2)</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Organizational Outline of the Xikang Province Establishment Committee is Determined <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Five to Seven Members with Two Divisions Underneath</p>
<p>Directly Under the Executive Yuan and Not Under the Command of Sichuan Province</p>
<p>Kangding Correspondence: After Huang Musong suggested that the central government set up a provincial government in Xikang, the relevant agencies such as the General Staff Headquarters and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission discussed the matter. As a result, it was proposed to first establish a "Xikang Political Affairs Committee" to prepare for the establishment. After the province meets all the conditions for establishing a province, the provincial government will be formally organized. After the meeting was submitted to the central government for review, it was decided to change it to the "Xikang Province Establishment Committee," and ordered the Ministry of the Interior and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to draft an organizational outline and submit it for approval and implementation. Now that the ministry has been ordered, it has consulted many times, and the general decision is that (1) the name of the Xikang Province Establishment Committee is agreed; (2) it should be directly under the Executive Yuan and should not be under the command of the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense Commissioner's Office; (3) there should be five to seven members of the committee, and one chairman; (4) there should be two divisions, a secretariat and a political affairs division, with several sections inside, and specialists should be hired to organize a design committee, or, in order to save public funds, several sections should be temporarily set up. The above principles, after repeated consultations, will be finalized, and a general outline will be prepared and submitted to the central government for implementation. According to a senior official who participated in the review, the organization should be smaller than the current provincial organization during the preparation period. After a considerable period of preparation, the small government will be formally organized and the committee will be abolished. Now the opinions of the central and local governments are unified, and this organization can be realized. (Xinmin News Agency)</p>

<p>Qingyuan and Zhenghe Counties are Ravaged by Bandits</p>
<p>Eastern Fujian Loses Approximately Four to Five Million Yuan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Red Bandit Fang Zhimin's forces failed to attack the provincial capital, they fled from Fu'an to Shouning, and then captured Xietan Town, the most prosperous town in the county. Later, after the 口⼝⼝ Division chased from Fu'an, and the 口⼝ Division stationed in Shoucheng joined forces to attack from the front and rear, the bandit forces were unsustainable and fled in different directions. One force fled through Xixi into Qingyuan County in Zhejiang Province, and the other force fled through Nanxi to Zhenghe County in northern Fujian. Yesterday, the provincial government has telegraphed the 口 Division to encircle and suppress the scattered bandits immediately to prevent them from penetrating deep into the inland of northern Fujian, and ordered the 口 Brigade to deploy defenses closely on the border between Fujian and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Among the counties in eastern Fujian, the most heavily damaged by the bandits this time are Muyang and Baishi in Fu'an, Xietan in Shouning, and Xiamen in Fuding. Muyang and Xietan were robbed empty, and Baishi and Xiamen were burned to the ground. The total loss is estimated to be between four and five million yuan. Although the bandits have retreated, the people have no homes to return to and have sent representatives to the province to request relief. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Floods in the Dongjiang River in Eastern Guangdong Cause Dikes to Collapse in Various Counties <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Refugees are Everywhere, and Crops are Completely Lost</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The downstream of the Dongjiang River in Guangdong Province has been hit by a major flood. The first to bear the brunt is Huiyang County. When the Hui River receded, the flood spread to Boluo and Dongguan counties. Dozens of villages in Boluo along the Jiangsu River became a lake on the 23rd. The area around Weilu Lake in the county, which is connected to Sucun, is close to the Jiangbin River and has dikes as barriers. However, on the 26th of the month, the Dongliao River rushed down, and the dikes suddenly became dangerous. The villagers were unable to rescue them, and the entire dike collapsed at 3:00 AM that morning. Inside the dike, there are 18 villages and 26 districts, all of which became a huge flood. No less than thousands of houses collapsed in each village one after another. The villagers, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled to the plateau for refuge. The fields and gardens in Longxi and Longhua were also flooded, and more than one million yuan was lost in crops, property, and livestock in more than ten villages.</p>
<p>Dongguan County is the key point where the Dongjiang River flows into the Pearl River and exits the sea. The terrain is even lower than Boluo, so the area affected by the disaster this time is even wider. In addition to the tragic situation of the breach of the Shangdong Township base dike, which has been reported in the newspaper, the dikes in the first, second, and third districts have also repeatedly reported breaches recently. In the third district, the populations of Duzhou Township, Shuibei Township, and more than ten villages such as Xia Nan Huangjia are all farmers, who are engaged in agriculture. Because the land is close to the Dongjiang River, it has been repeatedly affected by floods and has suffered frequent crop failures. They have borrowed tens of thousands of yuan from the River Management Association to build the base gardens in various places. The project has just been completed, and a major flood suddenly arrived in the late of this month. On the night of the 23rd of the month, the dikes in Chikan Huangjia and Shuibei townships were breached by dozens of feet. There were more than ten breaches in total. The flood flowed into the third district, and the fish ponds, mulberry gardens, and rice fields in each village were submerged. It was midnight, and the villagers were awakened from their dreams. Unable to escape in time, many people drowned. At this moment, refugees are everywhere, with nowhere to live. Cries can be heard from time to time in the mountains and fields. On August 28th and 29th, the flood still had not receded, and Fulong Garden in the county was also in danger.</p>
<p>Shilong Town is a major station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where merchants gather and the market is prosperous. Since the late of August, the Lu Garden east road Sanatorium to the west, until the Baihua Road Zhongshan Road were flooded, the water was waist-deep, and the low-lying alleys were even more submerged. Large and small shops moved to trade in other places, and the station's terrain was higher, and the nearby area has become a temporary market. Residents in the city row boats to buy goods, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. This time the whole county was flooded, and in addition to rice, peanuts lost about more than ten thousand yuan in value. Other losses such as sugar cane, green麻菓 wood, and other items are also not small, truly a major catastrophe in recent years. (August 31)</p>

<p>The Court Site is Determined to Be in the Nija Garden</p>
<p>The High Court Sends Personnel to Prepare in the City</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Anhui High Court, considering that Bengbu is the hub of the Pingpu Railway and the only major port on land in Anhui Province, only twenty or thirty miles away from Fengyang and Huaiyuan counties, plans to jointly establish the Fengyang Huaiyuan Local Court to handle civil and criminal lawsuits. After the High Court submitted the plan to the Judicial Yuan, it was delayed until now because there were no construction funds available. The provincial government has just raised more than 20,000 yuan. The High Court specially appointed Hu Shu as the director of the preparation committee, and led the preparation committee members Wu Fanghan and others to the city to set up an office to prepare. The Nija Garden on Guofu Street has now been designated, and surveying and mapping are underway. After the approval is obtained from the local authorities, bids will be invited and construction will begin, probably after October. It is reported that in addition to the court, a detention center will also be attached, which is expected to be completed in its entirety in February or March of next spring. After that, judicial affairs in Feng and Huai counties will be handled by the court, and the monthly operating expenses of the court will be allocated from the judicial fees of Feng and Huai counties, and the surplus funds from the recently abolished Shou County Local Court.

<h3 id="e114">Citizens in Southern Pu Report a Case of Corruption in Land Tax <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yang Leibo, Zhang Chengzhe, Zhuang Likang, Chen Zhengxian, Weng Xiding, and other citizens in Southern Pu, Songjiang County, sent telegrams to Chiang, the military commissioner of the Nanchang Camp, Yu, the standing committee member of the Central Party Headquarters and the president of the Court of Censors, Kong, the minister of finance, and Wang, the minister of education, stating that the coastal villages of this county have poor soil quality and very little harvest, and have never had land tax. Since the order to increase grain transport in the 18th year of the Republic of China, the owners have been unable to pay and have filed petitions for deferral. Those who were forced to pay grain transport by the village police and map officials were not a few. In September of last year, County Governor Jin Tiangang convened a meeting of more than ten owners' representatives, at which Che Zhao, the chief of the finance section, proposed to increase grain transport on the converted fields in Southern Pu and reduce and exempt all taxes by 60%, effectively collecting 40%. For the 22nd year, the 18th year was forcibly levied in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. This was approved by County Governor Jin in conjunction with Shen Zhengshu, a member of the Old Tax Clearing Committee, and submitted to the Provincial Department of Finance, which ordered Ye Zongcheng, the director of the First Land Tax Collection Office, to comply. Unexpectedly, the benevolence of the provincial government in reducing and exempting taxes has opened up the loopholes for those to hide and deceive. It was found that the increase in grain transport in Southern Pu was only more than 7,000 dan, but County Governor Jin actually included part of Northern Pu in it and reported more than 10,000 dan. The 3,260 dan of increased grain transport in Northern Pu were paid off by the owners year by year, and even in Southern Pu, some were forced to pay, but County Governor Jin actually hid the tax money and reported that there was no income for four years since the 18th year. To the superiors, he has reduced and exempted more than 10,000 dan of grain transport in the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st years, but to the subordinates, he did not recall the grain transport prints and strings that had been increased over the years. Can the procedures for handling land tax be like this? Moreover, at the beginning of the increase in grain transport in the converted fields, the books were compiled and the collection books were created, indicating the amount of Southern Pu and the amount of Northern Pu. A check of the files would make it clear. Section Chief Che was the section chief in the Finance Bureau during the tenure of She and two Shen, and was familiar with the finances of this county. How could he claim to be unaware? When the case was discovered and could not be remedied, he put Director Ye in custody and submitted a request to the Department of Finance to correct that the Northern Pu portion was not within the scope of reduction and exemption. His intention to embezzle was obvious. Moreover, the book was created and the strings were issued in the 23rd year, after the order to reduce and exempt taxes was issued. The original increased grain transport should have been reduced to 40%, but in May of this year, County Governor Jin still ordered the book writers to create the book and issue the strings as before, and the seals were ready to be issued. The citizen Xu Shilin and others found the land tax notice for the 23rd year and filed a complaint with the Department of Finance. When County Governor Jin heard about it, he reported to the Department of Finance that it had been stolen. His attempt to cover it up was obvious. In short, after the Finance Bureau was abolished, the county government was actually the competent authority for the county's finances. If there is no corruption in land tax, the county governor and section chief cannot be excused. If the blame is only placed on the collection director alone, how can it be fair? Leibo and others live along the coast. Since the conversion of fields to increase grain transport, they have suffered unbearably. They have repeatedly called for help and exhausted their voices, and finally won the approval of the Department to reduce and exempt taxes. Unexpectedly, the reduction and exemption of taxes has created an opportunity for County Governor Jin, Section Chief Che, Director Ye, and others to make a fortune. In total, the tax money from the increase in grain transport in the converted fields that they have embezzled is no less than 100,000 yuan. If this is not punished, where is the national law? Although County Governor Jin was once the secretary-general of the provincial government and has considerable influence with the province, the laws of the Republic of China strictly prohibit corruption. He is specially requesting your judgment to quickly investigate and punish him as a warning, which would be a great kindness.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Songhang Liquidation Office Closes <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>After the Songjiang Bank went bankrupt due to the absconding of the president, it owed a considerable amount of public and private funds. Later, the county court designated accountants such as Xia Sunhuan to carry out the liquidation and organized a liquidation office. Lawyer Zhang Yuanmei acted as an agent to separately urge the debtors to pay, and the money recovered was distributed to the creditors at 17%. The rest has not yet been closed. After a long period of time, a part of the debt status was requested by the court to allow the liquidation office to be revoked, and the unfinished work was transferred to the directors and supervisors of the bank to be responsible for the liquidation. Now, Xu Shousheng, a representative of the creditors, has written to the liquidation office to inquire about the work that should be reported to all sectors of society since the liquidation office was completed. There are also mortgage credit debtors and the amount of debts that have not been sued, as well as the names and amounts of each household that is still being sued but has not yet been completed, and the amount of money that has been recovered. The liquidation office hopes to announce the liquidation office's calculation, in order to make a great faith, and to督促 the directors and supervisors to be responsible for the liquidation in the future. At this moment, the liquidation office is in the process of closing down, and it will definitely be able to reassure all sectors of society regarding the above request.</p>

<p>Due to the drought in Liyang, the land is barren and nine out of ten villagers are destitute. Rui Baoyuan, the chief of the fourth district of the county, in view of the severe disaster situation in the district, specially organized a begging group to seek relief. He elected Rui Mengzhou, Shi Jiagen, and others as representatives to seek relief in the areas of Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuxi. Rui and others arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday and stayed at the Wuxi Hotel. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Rui and others went to the Second Stack of the Bank of China to visit the philanthropist Shi Xiangchen and request relief. Mr. Shi agreed to raise funds on his behalf and first set up a soup kitchen in the fourth district of Liyang County to save the starving disaster victims. In the afternoon, they went to the Red Swastika Society, the Puren Charity Association, and the Grain Trade Association to seek relief. This morning (4th) at 8:00 AM, they went to the Shenxin Third Yarn Factory outside Ximen to visit Rong Desheng, the owner of the factory. Mr. Rong generously agreed to set up Soup Kitchen No. 5 in the Fourth District of Li, with a limit of three months. At the same time, he entrusted someone to rush to Liyang to investigate the disaster situation. At 3:15 PM, Rui and his party took the Beijing-Shanghai Express train to Shanghai to seek relief. Once they had completed their work in Shanghai, they would come to Wuxi to consult with philanthropists Tang Baoqian, Jiang Huanqing, and others on relief measures.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Dispute over Desolate Dike is Unresolved <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Weisan, the mayor of Gushan Town, Jiangyin, led more than a thousand people to forcibly demolish the desolate dike in Chenshu Town, and劫 of 本邑 County Committee District Chief caused a great dispute. Later, the Construction Department instructed to temporarily open the dike, and Zhou Wei was 三申诫 and other situations have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that Yan Shenyu, the county governor of 本邑, believes that the Construction Department's order to temporarily open the dike was only a temporary measure. However, half a month has passed, and the Construction Department has not yet sent a formal committee to inspect the site. Recently, Yao Yan and other representatives of the Chenshu villagers have been running around to inform us that at this time when the autumn crops are about to show, it is a matter of life and death, and there is an urgent need for water. The people are panicked and cannot live a day. If this is delayed for a long time, I am afraid that other disputes will occur. Therefore, yesterday, I sent a telegram to the Construction Department to request that it send staff to investigate in detail and formulate fair measures to quell the disputes. As for Zhou Weisan, the mayor of Gushan Town, Jiangyin, who led people across the border to freely demolish the dike and rob 本邑 District Chief and County Committee, he was only given a warning, which is not enough to convince the people. It is also requested that the Jiangyin County Government be strictly ordered to dismiss and punish the town chief as a warning.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the county has suffered from severe drought without rain, and the crops have withered. Fortunately, several inches of rain revived them when they were on the verge of death. Unexpectedly, insect pests followed, devouring almost all the fruits of cotton, beans, soybeans, millet, etc. The average autumn harvest is less than 30%, and the disaster is severe, a situation rarely seen in the past seventy years. Therefore, recently, people in various districts have been petitioning the county government to forward their requests to the provincial government to exempt them from grain taxes to alleviate the people's distress.</p>

They also captured Jiang Zairong, the person guarding the hostage. The three suspects and the hostage were all taken back to the team headquarters. According to the hostage, after being kidnapped, she had been raped by Jiang Zairong more than fifty times. On the 4th, the team headquarters sent all the suspects in the case to the county government for review and handling.</p>

<p>Zhang Jimin, a resident of Miaosheng City in Zhenhai's second district, whose nickname was Xiaoniang, had a wife, Hu Caiqin, who was having an affair with a vagrant, Su Songhe. On the evening of the 20th of the twelfth lunar month last year, the adulterer Su Songhe took the opportunity to continue the affair with Hu. Unfortunately, they were caught by her husband, Zhang Jimin. Su Songhe immediately decided to kill him, forcing Hu to help him. They strangled Zhang Jimin to death with a rope. Fearing that the body might revive, he further used his personal Western knife to stab Zhang Jimin's abdomen. They moved the body to a vacant room's bed cabinet to conceal the crime. On the 13th of the fourth lunar month this year, Zhang Jimin's father, Zhang Junxian, discovered it and reported it to the Zhenhai County Government. After a thorough investigation by the county government, the adulterer Su Songhe and the woman Hu Caiqin were both sentenced to death yesterday.</p>

Mr. Liu is scheduled to go to Nanjing today and then to Jiangxi to meet with Wang and Jiang, and then return to his ancestral home in Wuxue to take care of his grandmother's funeral. He will return to Europe on an Italian ship next month. Yang plans to rest briefly in Shanghai before going to Jiangxi to meet with Jiang and report on the situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yang and Mr. Liu returned to China on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso. The ship entered the Wusongkou around 10 AM yesterday and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 11:30 AM. The welcoming party crossed the river to board the ship. The two gentlemen disembarked and transferred to the Jianghai Customs Jinghai small steamer to cross the river to Pudong. At 12:20 PM, they landed at the new customs wharf and went to their residences to rest. Tang Hanzong, an electrical chemistry and electrometallurgy engineer from the University of Grenoble in France, also returned to China on the same ship yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, those who went to the ship to welcome them included He Yaotsu of the Military Affairs Commission, Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Bureau, Wang Zemin, Dean of Education of the Army University, Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Geng Jiaji, Secretary of the Municipal Government, Zhang Mengling, representative of the Foreign Affairs Office, Mei Zhu, Wu Danzhen, Wang Picheng, Shi Guofan, officials and staff of the Army University, Italian Minister to China Bauscari, Du Yuesheng, Mrs. Yang, Mrs. Liu and many other relatives and friends, who boarded the small steamers of the Public Security Bureau and the Junpu Bureau, went to the wharf to welcome them.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Yang's Remarks <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to Yang Jie's remarks to reporters, he was ordered by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in November last year to go abroad to Europe with five members to study the military education and military facilities of various countries. Except for the five members who had returned to China earlier, he arrived in Shanghai today. During the inspection in Europe, he visited about twenty countries, and the situation was very good. The facilities of the armies of various countries are very modern, and the results obtained are quite numerous. However, because it involves military secrets, the results cannot be arbitrarily published. The materials obtained from this inspection are quite numerous and have been sent to Chairman Chiang at any time. Various countries are actively expanding their military equipment, and their morale is also very strong. However, the internal situation in various countries is unstable. Various countries have their own strengths in military technology, some focusing on the army, some focusing on the air force or navy, depending on the environment and terrain of their countries. However, they all devote their full efforts to strengthen their national defense, which is the same trend. He is scheduled to go to Lu in the next few days to meet with Chairman Chiang, report on the inspection process, and offer suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Liu's Remarks <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to Wendao, his leave of absence to return home is to build a tomb for his grandmother and to report the latest international situation to the central government, with no other tasks. The vacation is a total of three months. After spending two months on the round trip, he will stay in the country for about one month and then return to his post on the Conte Rosso. Although various European countries are currently actively expanding their military equipment, according to his observation, there will definitely be no war in the next five years. Although the atmosphere between Japan and Russia is very tense, it has eased due to the peace in Europe, and there will be no conflict for the time being. Although the European situation has eased slightly due to Germany's concessions, we must never think we are fortunate, because the contradictions and struggles between countries are becoming increasingly acute. We should bury ourselves in preparation to prevent the future. He decided to go to Nanjing tomorrow (that is, today) to meet with Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, and then go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang and report everything. After staying in Lu for a short time, he will go to his ancestral home in Wuxue to build a tomb for his grandmother and return to Europe next month on the Conte Rosso.</p>

<p>=A Vicious Assault Occurred in Moji=</p>
<p>=Today They Will Petition Party and Government Agencies=</p>
<p>More than 80 overseas Chinese in Japan were suddenly squeezed out by Japan and unreasonably expelled to return to China. They arrived in Shanghai at 10 AM yesterday on the Japanese mail ship Kasado Maru. When the ship arrived in Moji, 31 overseas Chinese were forced to disembark and wait for other ships to return home. A vicious assault also occurred at that time. Therefore, those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday included 50 men and women, scheduled to petition the party and government agencies today. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Arrival in Shanghai Yesterday: A Wretched Sight <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Kasado Maru entered the port at 9 AM yesterday and docked at the Xinhuishan Wharf in Pudong at 10:30 AM. Liu, a member of the foreign affairs section of the first section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Xia Zhongming, a member of the second section, and Inspector Zhou all arrived at the port to receive them and take care of everything on their behalf. The overseas Chinese were all wearing Western suits, each with a red silk scarf on the left lapel, with the words "Overseas Chinese in Japan" written on it. The women were wearing ordinary casual clothes. Because everyone was overly stimulated and exhausted from the journey, they were quite listless and looked extremely wretched. After the overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai, they temporarily stayed at the Daxin Public Inn in the 16th district. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also sent Tan Zhonglu and Li Zhujian to the hotel to express their condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Expulsion Process Is Outrageous <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News reporter interviewed Chen Fengqing, the representative of the expelled overseas Chinese, on the ship. According to him, a total of 81 men and women were unreasonably expelled by Japan. They were all from Yongjia and other counties in Zhejiang and had been doing business in Japan for many years. Most of them had established families and lived in Niigata, Yamagata, and other prefectures in Japan. Among them, most were engaged in the restaurant business and were all peaceful and law-abiding citizens. In recent years, the Kuomintang's party affairs have developed significantly abroad, so they also organized the Kuomintang's direct branch in Sendai. Overseas Chinese joined as party members very enthusiastically, which was discriminated against by the Japanese. This time, the Japanese authorities unreasonably expelled overseas Chinese who had lived in Japan for many years and had always been law-abiding, which was beyond our expectations. What is most hateful and outrageous is that the expelled overseas Chinese workers, except for carrying their personal clothing, were not allowed to take any other items. All the movable items and properties accumulated by the overseas Chinese businessmen through years of hard work and thrift were unreasonably confiscated. When they were expelled, they asked the consulate to negotiate with them, but the authorities also said that the Japanese were barbaric and unreasonable, and it was impossible to reason with them. They planned to report to the government and make an overall negotiation with the Japanese side. They were temporarily unable to deal with the suffering of our people who were forced to suffer, so we could only endure the humiliation and return home and ask the authorities for assistance.</p>

<p>After the ship departed from Yokohama, it was relatively peaceful along the way. Unexpectedly, when it arrived in Moji, the Japanese side, because a large number of overseas Chinese were expelled and returned to China, was afraid of being criticized by foreigners and the resentment of our compatriots. They did not hesitate to adopt a method of covering their ears and stealing the bell and specially sent more than 150 soldiers and police, most of whom were carrying weapons such as guns and clubs, with a fierce momentum, forcing the overseas Chinese to return to China in two batches. The overseas Chinese believed that since they had already been expelled, there was no need to return to China in any particular order and expressed their unwillingness to disembark, which angered the wild Japanese and implemented a military forced landing. The order was immediately disrupted, and the cries of wives and children were unbearable to hear. As a result, 31 people were forced to disembark and detained there, waiting for other ships to return home. At the time of the chaos, many overseas Chinese were injured, especially Zai Changtao, who was hit on the head, bleeding profusely. Zhou Yishun, Pan Rishun, Zhou Baozhen, and Wu Linhao were also seriously injured, and their lives are still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Petitions Today for Assistance <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese originally planned to petition the party and government agencies immediately after arriving in Shanghai yesterday. Later, because of the expulsion process and the re-assault along the way, they planned to write a memorial, asking for assistance, but there was not enough time, so they changed it to go to the Public Security Bureau for registration at 9 AM this morning, and then petition the party and other agencies in the city. They will immediately go to Nanjing to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Japanese government, and then return to their ancestral homes to find other livelihoods.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Presenting to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Request Relief <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the overseas Chinese felt that there was no way to appeal and specially presented to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to request that it be presented to the central government for relief. The memorial reads as follows: The overseas Chinese in Japan originally operated small businesses in various parts of northeastern Japan and have always been extremely law-abiding. On August 10, they were suddenly expelled by Japanese officials. On August 14, all of them went to Wang Hongnian, our Consul General in Yokohama, to ask for accommodation. A total of 73 men and women arrived and stayed at the Chinese Guild Hall for two weeks. Our Consul General specially purchased ship tickets on their behalf, ordering them to return to China on the Kasado Maru. All 73 people left Yokohama at 11 AM on August 27. On the way through Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe, they were forcibly inspected by the Japanese maritime police, subjected to violence, and beaten. Our overseas Chinese Zhou Baozhen was thrown into the sea by the Japanese army, but fortunately, he was rescued in time and did not drown. Wu Linhao was walking on the ship's building when he was beaten with a weapon by a Japanese policeman, and the wound on his forehead was three inches wide, and blood flowed all over the floor, fainting and losing consciousness for two hours. Other acts of violence are too numerous to mention. After arriving in Moji, the Kasado Maru was originally scheduled to depart at noon, but it was specially extended. At 7 PM that day, 190 Japanese maritime police came into the cabin and tied all the people with hemp ropes and took them ashore to the police station for interrogation. That night, three policemen were on duty, taking turns whipping them. Those who were too seriously injured died and revived. In addition, illegal torture was used, and many people were seriously injured. The sound of crying was incessant, and it was extremely cruel. Among the overseas Chinese, more than 30 people were detained elsewhere, and their lives and deaths are still unknown. Among the overseas Chinese, there were those who married Japanese women. The husband and wife came together, but the three Japanese women were suddenly detained by the Japanese police, and their families were separated, which made people's hair stand on end. Our overseas Chinese have always been law-abiding and have not committed any crimes. They have suffered this misfortune simply because of the decline of the country's power. Having suffered unemployment and torture, the human hell is almost the same. The ship departed on the 2nd. Zhou Baozhen was injured due to falling into the water and is currently being treated at the Moji Mail Ship Company. Wu Linhao was also injured in the head in Moji, and his life is in danger. In addition, 30 people are still detained in prison, and their lives and deaths are unpredictable. When the overseas Chinese left, they saw Pan Rishun and Zhou Yishun, who had fainted from the beating, and it was difficult to rescue them. Currently, the postal and telecommunications agencies in various parts of Moji are all controlled by the authorities, and there is no news. Our consul is also helpless. The overseas Chinese are spared the tiger's mouth and return to their homeland. The pain is immeasurable, and we ask the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to forward it to the central government for relief, and we will be very grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e146">It's time to quit... Ruined reputation... Self-inflicted suffering... <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Don't you see that sometimes respectable businessmen, because of smoking opium, are taken away by officials, fined thousands, imprisoned for months, reported in newspapers, and laughed at by society. Only then do they want to quit smoking, but they have already tasted the pain. Taking inferior drugs is even more harmful... Don't you see the ragged beggars on the street? When asked about their background, most of them come from wealthy families, only because they are addicted to smoking, wasting time and abandoning their careers, and in a blink of an eye, their reputation is ruined, their families are ruined, and they become beggars, known as old guns. Do you want to be one? ...... Looking to the future, examining the environment, opium addiction is something that must be quit. Have you realized it? Do you dare to smoke again? Please make up your mind to quit smoking today, get out of the sea of suffering, ... The quit-smoking drugs on the market, those that are effective must contain toxic substances, and those that are non-toxic are not effective. Only Tianjin Feng's addiction-breaking "Relief Jindan" medicine is kingly, with no toxic substances. It fundamentally removes tobacco accumulation and completely eliminates tobacco toxins. It is absolutely different from the substitutes on the market that use poison to attack poison. Feng's addiction-breaking [Relief Jindan] specializes in quitting opium, red pills, morphine, and heroin addiction. When quitting, smoke as usual, and you will gradually become disgusted with smoking. Take the medicine once every night before going to bed. You will feel comfortable in body and mind, without any pain, vomiting, or diarrhea, and it will not affect your work. After taking the medicine, the medicine will gradually push back the amount of smoking, and you will completely quit the addiction in a short period of time. Relief Jindan costs one and a half yuan per dose, plus one yuan for postage. Inquire for the addiction-quitting shortcut. The gas released by Junzhitang in Tianjin, which is stationed in Shanghai, has spread throughout the country. If we do not strive for production, promote national products to seek self-sufficiency, and block the leak of foreign currency, it will not be enough to save the country and survive and reverse this tide. Therefore, the work of encouraging production and promoting national products is being carried out actively and unreservedly. For example, the National Exhibition of the company recently held in Penglai Market in Shanghai, and the National Exhibition of Jiangdu County in Jiangsu Province, which is about to open, are all noisy and have been warmly welcomed by the people of the localities. It can be seen from this that the spirit and perseverance of the association are not empty rhetoric, but are in the same language as those who shout slogans. According to the Xin Xin News reporter, the association has recently received letters and telegrams from provinces, counties, and cities, requesting the holding of national exhibitions, such as Jinan, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Songjiang, Jiangdu, and other places, which have accumulated six or seven cases, and it is likely that it will be overwhelmed. It is reported that in addition to the Yangzhou and Jiangdu National Exhibitions, which are in progress, the secretariat has responded separately to the request letters and telegrams from other places, but because there was another telegram from Nanchang yesterday, the association will continue to prepare for the Nanchang National Exhibition in the next few days. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>The association received yesterday a telegram from the Jiangxi Provincial National Products Promotion Committee, addressed to the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers United Association, which stated: "We have received your telegram. The local national products exhibition is a matter of utmost urgency due to seasonal considerations. We earnestly request you to prepare immediately and send personnel to Jiangxi to coordinate. Our committee plans to hold a large-scale mobile national products exhibition in Nanchang City to give the local people a thorough understanding of national products and thereby inspire them to embrace the concept of using national products. We would greatly welcome your association's leadership in bringing member manufacturers to Jiangxi to participate. The relevant party and government departments here have already filed for approval. This telegram serves as further notification. We hope you will investigate and handle accordingly and reply. Respectfully, Jiangxi Provincial National Products Promotion Committee." It is reported that the association immediately replied, "Telegram received. We will dispatch personnel to Jiangxi on [date omitted]."</p>

<p>According to a statement by Chen Binghui, a standing committee member of the association, the Yangzhou National Products Exhibition, organized by the association at the invitation of the Yangzhou Public Education Center to collect and exhibit products from domestic national products manufacturers, was originally scheduled to open on September 1st. However, due to the enthusiastic participation of various manufacturers, the original venue was insufficient, and the venue was expanded, requiring time for construction. The opening was therefore postponed to September 5th. According to a letter received yesterday from the association's representative in Yangzhou, the venue construction was completed on the 3rd, with a total of eighty rooms. Each manufacturer's venue has also been allocated, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held today. It was also reported that manufacturers from this city, such as Ya Pu Er, Wu Zhou, Zhong Fa, Tai Kang, San Xing, Tian Chu, and Da Dong, had sent personnel to Yangzhou yesterday to attend the opening ceremony of the national products exhibition. Furthermore, Liu Zhongying, a standing committee member of the association, came to Shanghai on official business the night before last. Due to the urgency of presiding over the opening of the Yangzhou exhibition, he took the early train to Zhenjiang and then to Yangzhou yesterday morning. It is also reported that after the opening of the Yangzhou exhibition, the association will send Mr. Liu and industrialist Shi Kejian on a special trip to Jiangxi to discuss the Jiangxi exhibition.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Special Investigation Record of National Products Industry <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>(3) Cotton Knitted Underwear Industry</p>
<p>Cotton knitted underwear, including undershirts, underpants, and swimsuits, is a newly emerging industry. Initially, all of these were imported goods. In the past ten years or so, factories in this sector have gradually developed, reducing imports by 60-70%. This can be considered an achievement of national products factories. The reporter specially visited Mr. Ren Shigang, General Manager of Wuhe Weaving Factory, a leader in the cotton knitted underwear industry, and inquired in detail. He was kind enough to provide information on the general situation. The following is a special record:</p>
<p>There are dozens of businesses in the cotton knitted underwear industry, specializing in the manufacture of undershirts, underpants, and spring and autumn shirts. Five years ago, an industry dinner party was organized to connect emotions and maintain market prices. However, only fourteen companies joined. Prices for both winter and summer products are carefully studied and then set. The annual sales volume of these products is approximately 7-8 million yuan. Wuhe Factory alone has annual sales of over 1 million yuan. In the past two or three years, the number of companies in the industry has been increasing, most of which are small, family-run factories with capital of around 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. As a result, production is increasing and has become a trend of supply exceeding demand. Some companies specialize in the production of fabrics instead of clothing. These fabrics are sold to rubber factories as lining cloth or resold to sewing factories to make clothing. In recent years, rubber sales have declined, the market has been sluggish, and the environment has deteriorated, making sales even more difficult. At the same time, production is increasing, and prices are falling, which has led to a decline in the sales of these products. Regarding raw materials, domestic yarn can be used for the organization of thermal shirts, with 20-count, 16-count, 8-count, 7-count, and 6-count yarns being the most common. Undershirts of 42-count and below are all woven with domestic yarn. However, fine undershirts must be woven with 80-count to 100-count and 120-count yarns. For these raw materials, except for a small portion purchased from Chinese yarn factories, the rest must be purchased from the United Kingdom and the United States. Next, the working area was visited. From the entry of the yarn to the completion of the clothing, there are 24 working steps, and the procedures are extremely complicated, and sorting requires a lot of attention. Because the manufacturing is continuous, each part must be consistent and strive for scientific production methods in order to make the products exquisite and popular. The cleanliness and orderliness of Wuhe Factory meet scientific principles everywhere, so it can produce excellent products and sell them well in the market. As for sales, due to the recent decline in rural areas, the purchasing power of the general public is weak, and sales are quite difficult. It is not easy to lend money to all parties, and current sales are inevitable. At the same time, industry competition is fierce, discounts are falling frequently, and foreign goods are dumped to compete for the market, which is becoming more and more intense. Looking ahead, it is not possible to be optimistic. Among the companies in the industry, those with stable operations can barely maintain the status quo in recent years without failing. Mr. Ren believes that the future trend of our industry is: (1) the government should increase tariffs on similar foreign goods; (2) industries should maintain each other and not kill each other for meaningless sacrifices; (3) the whole country should work together to use national products; and (4) social leaders and intellectuals should do their best to promote and encourage, and lead by example. After this, the development of this industry may be unlimited. At present, Japanese goods are still the most common among imported goods, especially in North China. However, imported goods have been reduced in recent years in South China and Central China. However, the sorting work of imported goods is indeed excellent, and the cost is also low. If this industry wants to compete, it must save on floating expenses, work hard, and have absolute cooperation between labor and capital, and the financial sector must sincerely help. Mr. Ren also said that this factory feels that the current situation in rural areas is that it is difficult for this industry to develop temporarily, and he hopes that everyone will love national products, so that the purchasing power of all parties will increase, and the development of this industry can be expected. Mr. Ren is a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Hong Kong. He has been starting a business in Shanghai for seven or eight years. He has contacted the industry to publicly set prices, which is trusted by all parties. Recently, he has established Chinese National Products Companies in various places and went to investigate without any effort, which is especially rare.</p>

<p>Preparatory Meeting for the First General Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gaogiao Rural Improvement Association held its first preparatory meeting at the Local Association located at 138 Jing'an Temple Road at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The attendees were Zhang Chuanzheng, Pan Hongding, Zhong Yuliang, Shi Liangcai, Xie Bingchong, Zhao Dixian, Qu Shao Yi, Du Yuesheng, Gui Yanfang, Zou Bingwen, Huang Renzhi, Chen Zheqing, Guo Shun, Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Lü Yuequan, Liu Zhanen (represented by Wang Kuisheng), Wei (represented by Lai Douyan), and Ding Fengshan (Ding Rusong). Those attending as observers were Wang Kuisheng, the secretary, Liu Guofan, the secretary, and Lian Yousan. There were a total of thirty members, with twenty-one attending. After the bell rang to start the meeting, Mr. Du Yuesheng first gave an opening speech, stating in brief: "Esteemed members, today, as the convener, I would like to say a few words before the formal meeting begins. The urgent need for rural improvement in our country is evident from all perspectives and is worthy of our efforts. Although some may say that doing it only now is like applying medicine after the illness has worsened, or like trying to quench a distant fire, I believe that doing something is always better than doing nothing. As long as we work hard, regardless of the degree of success, we can at least find some comfort in our conscience towards the country and society, and we will surely gain some experience and understanding in the path of national self-salvation. The colleagues at the Local Association spent a long time investigating and researching, and finally selected the northern part of Gaogiao District and Gaoxing District in this city as the first experimental area, because it happens to be my hometown, so I was entrusted to take responsibility for initiating the organization. After two months of preparation, the permit from the Municipal Party Department has been issued, and the office will soon be moved to Gaogiao to start work. Today, I feel very happy and honored that so many comrades who are concerned about rural improvement have gathered together to hold the first grand preparatory meeting. Now, I would like to ask everyone to elect a temporary chairman to preside over today's proceedings." Later, the group unanimously elected Mr. Du as the temporary chairman, and first asked Mr. Shi Liangcai, the chairman of the Local Association, to report on the preparatory process and the procedures for registration. Mr. Huang Renzhi read out the organizational outline, which was amended and passed item by item. After that, Du Yuesheng was elected as the chairman of the association and the chairman of the board of directors. The chairman then proposed Ding Fengshan, Zhang Wei, Huang Renzhi, Liu Zhanen, Xie Bingheng, Zhong Yuliang, Su Shude, Yang Shuyu, Pan Hongding, Mu Ouchu, and Qu Shao Yi as eleven directors, and designated Ding Fengshan as the economic custodian. The proposal was unanimously approved. The meeting also passed the organizational system of the office and the regular budget. Secretary-General Wang Kuisheng introduced Liu Guofan, the secretary of the Rural Education Department, and Lian Yousan, the secretary of the Rural Education Department. Mr. Liu is from Northeast China, graduated from a rural normal school, and served as the principal of Shenyang Dongling Elementary School and Tangshan Mining Area Elementary School, and also as the secretary of the Eryou Club. He is knowledgeable and experienced in rural education and represents the youth of Northeast China, which can remind the public not to forget to recover the Northeast territory. Mr. Lian Yousan founded a rural elementary school in Gaogiao and has nine years of struggle history. He is currently the principal of Rixin Elementary School and has always had a strong desire to improve the economic life of the countryside. It is especially commendable that he has obtained the permission of Mr. Xie Bingheng, the school director, to devote half of his time to serve as the secretary of the Rural Economic Department of the association. Finally, Secretary-General Wang Kuisheng briefly reported on the work schedule and the phased plan for the first year. After some discussion, the meeting adjourned. Some members gathered at Zhongshe for dinner and a lively discussion. It is reported that the preparatory committee has borrowed the upstairs of the Gaogiao Town Fire Brigade as a temporary office, and the residences for the staff have also been rented. Soon, they will move to that place to work. After the Du Ancestral Hall Hospital is completed, the office will officially work at the Jiqun Hospital.</p>

<p>Li Haifeng, the leader of the resistance army on the Huai River, has fought against Japan in Yizhou, Jinzhou, and other counties. The siege of Yizhou on April 27th and the capture of the Japanese pacification official Ishimoto Kenjiro were widely known at home and abroad, and he was especially famous. He still has 20,000 troops under his command and has now been appointed by Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin as the Western Route Commander of the Northeast Volunteer Army. Yesterday, his aide Liu brought a telegram announcing his assumption of office, which is specially published below:</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices and compatriots across the country: Since the September 18th Incident, the violent Japanese have occupied our three provinces, and then captured the Huai River, advancing inch by inch. The tiger devours and the whale swallows, and their ambition is not yet exhausted. Speaking of this, how can we not be sad? Li Haifeng, filled with righteous indignation, started an uprising in Chaoyang in March of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Over the years, he has fought bloody battles in the areas of Yizhou and Jinzhou, repeatedly defeating the enemy's vanguard. As international relations become increasingly dangerous and the people of Northeast China are in dire straits, waiting to be rescued, now is the time to recover lost territory and the time for us to serve our country. I have been appointed by Commander Wang Delin of the Northeast Volunteer Army as the Western Route Commander of the Northeast Volunteer Army and will assume office at my defense post. From now on, under the leadership of Commander Wang, I will wholeheartedly unite and continue to resist Japan. I will uphold the spirit of perseverance and strive to fight until the goal of recovering lost territory is achieved. I will never stop. This is specially announced for your consideration. Li Haifeng, Western Route Commander of the Northeast Volunteer Army, bows.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegrams Guangdong Finance Department Again: National Products Should Not Be Subject to Special Taxes <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Within a Country, It is Valuable to Adjust Surpluses and Deficiencies</p>
<p>It is Inappropriate to Imitate the Behavior of Tariff Wars</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent another telegram to the Guangdong Finance Department yesterday regarding the special tax on national products in Guangdong Province, which stated: "To Guangzhou Guangdong Finance Department: Our chamber previously telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government regarding the proposal in Guangdong Province to establish a bureau to collect special taxes on imported foreign goods and goods entering from outside the province, requesting that national products be excluded from the scope of special taxes and handled separately, in order to protect domestic production. We received on August 29th Guangdong Provincial Government Approval No. 4335, which stated: 'We have received your telegram. It has been found that the Construction Department previously proposed collecting a special import tax on foreign goods in order to supplement the province's industry and commerce. This was submitted to the 288th meeting of the 6th Committee of this government, which decided to hand it over to the Finance Department for review and to draft specific measures for submission for approval. We have not yet received a reply. Regarding the previous situation mentioned in the telegram, please handle it in conjunction with the Finance Department.' We found that the approval mentioned the Construction Department's proposal to collect a special import tax on foreign goods, (omitted). However, the provincial government did not copy the Construction Department's original proposal, nor did it state in the approval. Our chamber has already explained the interests of this matter in detail in the Yang Telegram to the provincial government on August 7th. Since it has been forwarded for review, we believe that your department will consider it in detail. Our chamber believes that this matter is of great importance and has the following to add. It has been found that Guangdong Province has abundant products and has recently been determined to revitalize industry. For example, the rubber of Qiongzhou and the soda ash made in Guangdong are sold to other provinces, and the government has explicitly ordered that they be exempt from transit taxes. As for sugarcane, Shanghai and Qingdao sugar merchants have been reported to be placing orders in large quantities, as Guangdong Province has been striving to improve the quality. It is evident that within a country, it is valuable to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and exchange what one has for what one needs. It is inappropriate to divide regions like foreign countries and apply the behavior of European tariff wars to the same country. If each province has its own special products and suitable crafts, Guangdong Province should focus on the big picture and develop its strengths if it wants to remedy industry and commerce. It does not need to exclude products from other provinces, so that there is no place for development in Guangdong Province. Only then can it be said that it has done its best to support industry. Moreover, the state is exempting transit taxes on Guangdong Province's special products, which should be levied as a reward. However, Guangdong Province suddenly created a special tax after the abolition of likin, which has no legal basis and is used to resist goods from other provinces. In terms of law and reason, it is unforgivable. If this move is realized, it will be tantamount to treating Shanghai factories as outside the law and reducing national products to foreign goods, causing the immature industry that is fluttering in the wind and rain to fall into a narrow and unpromising field. The Shanghai merchants' interests are closely related, and public sentiment is indignant. How can we plan a method to deal with it? Guangdong Province's commerce and finance have many connections with other provinces. How can it transcend the mundane and not seek mutual assistance? This is using a spear to attack a shield, which is definitely not in Guangdong Province's interest. We will once again earnestly present the interests. We hope that your department will distinguish and handle it separately, which would be most fortunate. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The China Factory Inspection Association held its second annual meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at Minqing Road in the city center. More than 20 members, including Cheng Qiyuan and Tian Heqing, attended. First, members from various regions reported on the general situation of factory inspection work in each district and the actual situation of factory disasters. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (1) The association's membership should be expanded.

C: Teachers, labor experts, and those interested in factory inspection at the former Ministry of Industry's Factory Inspection Personnel Training Institute may be invited by the association as sponsored members. (2) Farewell to Comrade Lu Jicang, a member of the association, who is going abroad for observation, and entrust Mr. Lu to observe the British factory inspection system. (3) Request the Ministry of Industry to convene a national factory inspection conference as soon as possible to facilitate the administration of factory inspection. (4) Request the central government to select current factory inspectors to go to various countries to observe factory inspection administration and other factory inspection technical work.

<h3 id="e158">Division of Municipal and County Tooth Tax Implemented <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Effective from September 1st</p>
<p>Shanghai's tooth tax is divided into long-term and short-term types. It has always been allocated by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funds Management Office to supplement Jiangsu Province's education funds. However, the municipal government has repeatedly requested the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allocate the tooth tax in the urban area for municipal collection in order to clarify the boundaries. It is now known that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has approved the allocation and will implement it from September. It is also reported that after the municipal finance bureau receives the municipal tooth tax, it will send personnel to collect it and will not invite merchants to contract for it. As for the county area, the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office has ordered the Shanghai County Government to invite merchants to bid for contracting the short-term tooth tax, with a bid amount of 3,200 yuan, which is scheduled to be opened at the county government on the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cotton Traders Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the government's promulgation of the Cotton Prohibition Regulations, which has many obstacles, we intend to request the Ministry of Industry to popularize inspection in advance and postpone the implementation of the prohibition. We have already transferred the telegram to the government through the general assembly for presentation. According to Article 14 of the Cotton Prohibition Regulations, the effective date of these regulations shall be determined by decree. That is to say, even though the regulations have been promulgated, whether they are implemented remains to be assessed. However, the Shanghai Chinese Yarn Factory United Association actually published a notice in the newspaper yesterday stating that from September 1st, goods must be imported in accordance with the conversion stipulated in the Prohibition Regulations. This kind of illegal act is definitely not what our association can recognize. Moreover, it is worth the new flower market. If no measures are taken to stop it, it will endanger the national cotton industry. We intend to ask the general assembly to telegraph the government again to present it on our behalf, so as to avoid major disputes and improve the situation step by step." It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has transferred the telegram to the Ministry of Industry for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Hui Ning Fellow Villagers Association Received Telegram from Tunxi Reporting Defense of Hui Province <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Hui Ning Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Commissioner Liu Jianzhong, which replied: "'I am grateful for your telegram. The bandits who fled from Kaihua and harassed Huangjian were repelled by the local militia team. They have been wandering and fleeing in the border area of Xiunan for days. I have ordered the local teams to contact and flank them, but they have not been successful. They have now returned to the Duanxin area in Wujing. I have sent teams to block them and telegraphed the army stationed in Wuyuan to encircle them. They have escaped from Xiunan today. In the future, they may join the bandits in Fuliang. I don't think the interior will be disturbed. However, this year's drought has affected the autumn harvest. The current food situation is alarming, especially in Huai'an. I hope that fellow villagers abroad will raise grain stones and transport them to their hometown for relief. Public and private feelings are communicated.' First District Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office." On the same day, Luo, the director of the Tunxi Public Security Bureau, sent a letter reporting on the details of the bandit suppression and defense. The bandits have now been defeated, and the defenses in all places are tight. There is no possibility of gathering. The Tunxi defense is especially consolidated. A stone building is being built to increase self-defense. The market is peaceful and there is no need to worry. Previously, it was rumored in Shanghai that bandits attacked Qicheng and Yixian was in danger. After the Xu Association inquired in many ways and the fellow villagers in Yixian telegraphed Qi for inquiries, they received a reply yesterday stating that more than 200 bandits arrived in Qi last night and did not harass the area. Dong Zao Huang's battalion arrived and the bandits were defeated after a brief battle and fled eastward. The shops and residents did not suffer losses. Yicheng is safe and sound and has strong defense capabilities. It is expected that the bandits may have fled from Dahong Ridge to Zhide Guichi.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Pinghu Joint Transport Long-Distance Bus Robbed South of Caohejing</p>
<p>Two Thieves Disguised as Passengers, Two Thieves Ambushed Mid-Way</p>
<p>Police Received Report and Pursued, Killing One and Wounding One</p>
<p>Those Responsible for Local Public Security Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Pinghu joint transport long-distance bus, which was driving between Shanghai and Pinghu, was robbed by bandits south of Caohejing at about 10:30 AM yesterday. After the incident, the police officers of the Sixth District and Third Precinct pursued and killed one thief and wounded one thief north of Huiling Station. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Passenger Transformed into Robber <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Pinghu through bus service, jointly operated by the Shanghai-Minhang-Nantuo Bus Company and the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration, runs exclusively between Shanghai and Pinghu. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the No. 6 bus departed from Guohuo Road in Shanghai on schedule, carrying over twenty male and female passengers. When the bus arrived at the Tushanwan station, two additional male passengers boarded – one wearing a white short shirt and pants, the other wearing a silk long gown, a straw hat, and holding bus tickets to the Qianliangmiao station. Shortly after, the bus continued its journey. Unexpectedly, when it reached about one kilometer south of Caohejing, the two passengers who had boarded later suddenly produced handguns, threatening and coercing the passengers to hand over all their gold and silver jewelry, cash, and foreign currency. They also forced the driver, Zhang Lansheng, to stop the bus. The passengers looked at each other in dismay, unable to resist, and had to submit to the robbery. Simultaneously, two other bandits, who had been lying in ambush nearby, also joined in, boarding the bus to rob and plunder.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Hastily Fleeing with the Loot <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, at that moment, the No. 7 through bus, traveling from Pinghu to Shanghai, also arrived at the scene. Noticing the No. 6 bus stalled along the way, they assumed it was due to mechanical failure and stopped to inquire. Upon seeing this, the bandits, fearing exposure, hastily got off the bus and fled with the stolen goods. After the passengers explained what had happened, the bandits were already far away. The accompanying inspectors, Chen Jueyan and Shougen, arranged for the passengers from the No. 7 bus to transfer to the No. 6 bus. They then transported the robbed passengers to the sixth district, third precinct station in Caohejing to report the incident. Simultaneously, they reported the situation to the company and then returned to the scene of the crime, starting the No. 6 and No. 7 buses as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Fierce Battle at Huiling Station <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the third precinct of the sixth district immediately dispatched a large number of armed police officers, riding in vehicles and bicycles, to search along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, Caohejing Station, and the Huiling Station area. Near the northern side of Huiling Station, they suddenly encountered two suspicious individuals walking hastily ahead. The police officers immediately rushed forward and ordered them to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the two men were the bus robbers. Seeing armed police officers chasing them from behind, they desperately opened fire on the police officers. As a result, the police officers returned fire, triggering a fierce battle at the northern side of Huiling Station. Bullets flew everywhere, like a string of pearls. After a brief standoff, the bandits were overpowered and retreated towards the Northwest Hongqiao Town, Baziqiao area, fighting as they went. When they reached Wangjia Lane, two more bandits joined the fight. However, one of the original bandits was shot in the leg. Another bandit dragged him up and carried him away as they fled. One bandit was shot in the chest by a police officer and fell to the ground on the spot. He was captured. Upon searching his person, the police found a jade bracelet, a jade ring, a gold-filled wristwatch, a gold pocket watch, a gold watch chain, and a six-inch handgun with the number 129012. He was taken to the precinct. Under interrogation, he identified himself as Zhang Shiying from Xujiahui and said nothing more. He soon died from his injuries. This morning, the court was notified to conduct an autopsy. The bureau was notified to dispatch detectives to pursue the remaining bandits, but they have not yet been apprehended.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Investigation of the Robbery <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the robbery, subsequent investigation suggests that it may have been motivated by the excessive amount of gold and silver jewelry worn by the passengers. However, the fact that the bandits were lying in ambush in the middle of the journey suggests that it may have been pre-planned. Currently, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway sees heavy traffic of Chinese and foreign travelers. Moreover, the area south of Caohejing is a bustling district. The occurrence of a daytime bus robbery is indeed rare. It is hoped that those responsible for maintaining public order will take effective measures to address this, lest people view the area as a dangerous place. The names of the robbed passengers are listed below: (1) Liu Cui, from Haiyan, lost a jade and diamond ring, a gold ring, a gold watch chain, a diamond platinum wristwatch, a jade bracelet, a gold cigarette holder, a gold toothpick, and over twenty yuan in cash. (2) Wang Jiahuan, from Tinglin, lost a gold watch. (3) Tao Taiqing, from Minhang, lost a gold ring and nineteen yuan in silver. (4) An accounting clerk from a Pinghu Huangxingji Flower Shop lost a check for 300 yuan and over ten yuan in cash, as well as over fifty yuan in cash from passengers surnamed Han and Wang, totaling approximately six thousand yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Yesterday’s Thunderstorm Lasted Approximately Half an Hour <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Temperature 95.7 Degrees</p>
<p>Since last week, the weather in this city has gradually turned cooler, with a refreshing autumn breeze. However, yesterday morning, it suddenly became hot and stuffy again. The Fahrenheit thermometer rose sharply to 95.7 degrees. Even when sitting quietly indoors, one was drenched in sweat. At 4:20 PM, the sky suddenly became covered with dark clouds, and a fierce northerly wind blew. In an instant, thunder and lightning roared, and a torrential downpour began. After about forty minutes, the rain began to subside, and it stopped completely at 5:40 PM. Many low-lying roads in both the Chinese and Foreign concessions of the city were flooded with two to three inches of water, which gradually receded after the rain stopped. The surrounding rural farmlands benefited greatly from this timely rain, with rice, cotton, and various vegetables all thriving. Farmers were universally delighted.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Chinese and Western Detectives Secretly Arrest 21 Gamblers <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Arrested from Tongde Lane, Xihuaide Road</p>
<p>Since the authorities in charge of police affairs in both the Chinese and Foreign concessions of this city vigorously enforced the ban on gambling, many gamblers, unwilling to give up the lucrative business, moved to the Toyo Company dock in the American Concession of Hongkou. They rebuilt their operations, setting up tables in the open air or hiring large barges, moored in the Huangpu River, to gather gamblers to gamble on the boats. They also gambled in the cabins of ocean-going vessels docked at various wharves. Although the Chinese and Foreign concession police detectives have conducted raids one or two times, these people simply move from one place to another. Now, they are renting secret rooms in various alleys in Hongkou to gamble and collect commissions. Yesterday (the 4th) at noon, the chief detective Wen Hua of the Hongkou Minhang Road Police Station, after confirming the location of the gambling den with Xipu's head, personally led Chinese detectives Ding Baoxiang and Wang Debiao, along with Chinese and Western detectives, to secretly drive in patrol cars to No. 20 Tongde Lane, Xihuaide Road, at the eastern end of Zhonghongqiao. They dispatched police to guard the front and back doors, then stormed in. At that time, there were seventy or eighty gamblers inside, gambling and shouting with great enthusiasm. They were arrested. However, due to the large number of gamblers, many escaped. In the end, 21 gamblers, including Wu Xingen (also known as Blind Xingen), Shen Alai (also known as Salted Meat Alai), Jiangbei Da Mao, Nanchang A Gen (also known as Little A Gen), Zhang Zhenhan, Zhang Ading, Wang Fuji, Shen Wanshan, Little Suzhou, and Chen Xiaohui, were arrested, along with gambling equipment, including shaking cylinders, silver boxes, chips, cash, and tables and benches. They were all taken to the police station to await investigation.</p>

<p>His Sentence Expired on the 30th of Last Month</p>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang, a young man from Sichuan, discovered that the Xinghualou Cantonese restaurant on Fuzhou Road was purchasing Japanese seafood products. Driven by righteous indignation, he threw a grenade as a warning. However, the grenade did not explode, and Zhang himself was captured by the doorman of the restaurant and the police officers on Shanxi Road. He was sent to the First Special Court, prosecuted on criminal charges, and sentenced to three months in prison. He was transferred to prison to serve his sentence. Zhang's three-month sentence expired on the 30th of last month. He was summoned by the First Special Court, questioned, and then released.</p>

<p>Price of 100 Yuan is 8 Yuan</p>
<p>Five Criminals Arrested in Disguise</p>
<p>Liu Xueyou, a Yancheng native living in Tanjiazhai Panjiawan in Zhabei who worked as a rickshaw puller, Xiang Zhongyu, a Qinghe native who worked in the house at No. 100 Panjiawan, and Zhou Bingxiu, a barber who worked in a straw house opposite the old station on Zhongxing Road, etc., routinely bought five-yuan counterfeit banknotes of the China Industrial Bank and the Central Bank, etc., totaling 20 banknotes, equivalent to 100 yuan, at a price of 8 yuan, from secret counterfeit currency manufacturing organizations. They then went to various markets in the city to use them, making considerable profits. Liu and the others planned to continue buying and selling. However, their scheme was discovered by Dong Wenrui, deputy leader of the investigation team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Dong Wenrui reported the situation of Liu and the others using counterfeit banknotes to the leader of the investigation team, Lu Ying, who dispatched male and female detectives, along with the police officers of the fourth district, to disguise themselves and go to No. 100 Panjiawan on the evening of the day before yesterday, pretending to be vendors to trade with Liu. As a result, five counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the China Industrial Bank, a Kunshan County Public Security Bureau detective's license, twenty-one pawn tickets, and seven bullets were found in Liu's house. One counterfeit five-yuan banknote of the Central Bank was also found on Xiang Zhongyu. In addition to arresting Liu Xueyou and Xiang Zhongyu, five accomplices, including Jiang Yunqing (also known as Jiang Wu), a Yancheng native, Zhou Bingxiu, a Qinghe native, and Tian Jiazong, an Anhui native, were also arrested. The counterfeit banknotes and evidence were taken to the investigation team for detention. Yesterday morning, Liu confessed under interrogation that Xiang Zhongyu had given him these twenty-five yuan of counterfeit banknotes of the China Industrial Bank. When the other criminals were questioned, they gave evasive answers. Team leader Lu believed that the case involved the use of counterfeit banknotes and the illegal possession of firearms, which not only disrupted the financial order but also violated the law. Therefore, he ordered that Liu Xueyou and the other five criminals, along with the counterfeit banknote evidence, be sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau yesterday afternoon to be dealt with according to the law.</p>

<p>Looked Flustered When Seeing Water Patrol Team</p>
<p>Eight Large Bags Found Under the Bed</p>
<p>Chen Songshan and other police officers of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team, while patrolling the river on patrol boats yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM, passed the Huangpu River bank at the Dada Pier in Nanshi and spotted the Zhoushan steamer docked there, not yet anchored. They immediately boarded the ship to check whether the passengers were carrying prohibited items privately. They saw Xu Xiaobao (26 years old, from Haimen), the escort police officer on the ship, sitting in his berth. However, Xu looked flustered when he saw the police team arriving, arousing Chen and the other police officers' suspicion. They went in and searched his cabin, finding eight large bags of red pills, estimated to be about 8,000 pills, hidden under his bed. Xu was immediately detained, and the evidence was taken to the team. When Chief Zhu interrogated Xu Xiaobao, Xu claimed that he did not know who had hidden the 8,000 red pills in his cabin. As Xu was an escort police officer, he dared to smuggle highly addictive drugs, and therefore Zhu ordered that a report be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Zhang Xiqi, Director of Guanghua Eye Hospital, Suddenly Disappears <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Was Originally from Taiwan and Changed His Registration to Fujian</p>
<p>Missing for Three Days Without Any News</p>
<p>Was He Kidnapped or Abducted?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiqi, the director of Guanghua Eye Hospital at No. 116 Weier Meng Road in the French Concession, suddenly disappeared at 9:00 AM on the 1st of this month while going out for a consultation. For three days, there has been no news. Only yesterday did Zhang's family become alarmed and report the details to the police station, which are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e172">Originally from Taiwan <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiqi, a Fujian native, is 37 years old, young, capable, and patriotic. Zhang was originally from a prominent family in Taiwan. Because he was saddened by the island of Taiwan falling into foreign hands and ashamed to be a subject of the foreigners, he changed his registration to Fujian. He studied in Japan in his early years and had the ambition to be a good doctor rather than a good official, specializing in ophthalmology. However, Zhang's words and actions at that time were already noticed by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Coming to Shanghai <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>While studying in Japan, Zhang married a Japanese woman and had a daughter, who is now eight years old. After completing his studies, Zhang first took his wife back to Taiwan and founded the Zhonghua Association. Because he handled affairs fairly, he was admired by the overseas Chinese. Four years ago, he came to Shanghai and rented a house at No. 2 Hongan Lane, Luban Road in the French Concession. He first established the Guanghua Eye Hospital on Lao Bazi Road and also served as a professor of ophthalmology at Southeast Medical College. The relationship between teachers and students was excellent. When the January 28th Incident occurred, he moved to No. 116 Weier Meng Road in the French Concession last spring and continued to call it Guanghua Eye Hospital. Because Zhang's medical skills were profound, those seeking treatment always achieved success. As a result, his medical practice was very prosperous.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Deeply Patriotic <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>In order to expand his medical practice, Zhang also established a branch on No. 810 North Sichuan Road and hired Zheng Guoshun, a Cantonese, as his assistant (Zheng is 24 years old). Because Zhang specialized in ophthalmology, he invented a secret medicinal liquid, which was widely sold in the Shantou and Xiamen areas. Zhang's younger brother managed this business near Xiamen and often wrote to his younger brother, instructing him to use some of the profits to help the poor compatriots in Taiwan. This demonstrates Zhang's patriotism.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Invited to Make a House Call <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>At 7:30 AM on the 1st of this month, Zhang first went from his residence on Luban Road to Weier Meng Road for a consultation, which continued until 9:15 AM. Suddenly, an uninvited guest wearing a coffee-colored long silk robe and speaking in the local dialect came to the registration desk and asked Zhang to make a house call. After paying the fee, the guest turned and left. At that time, Zhang did not pay any attention. Around 11:00 AM, when Zhang's consultations were just about to end, the guest hurriedly returned and called three rickshaws, urging Zhang to leave.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Gone and Never Returned <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Zhang asked where they were going, and the guest replied, "Nanyang Bridge." Zhang then instructed his assistant, Zheng Guoshun, to bring the medicine kit and follow the guest out the door, taking a rickshaw south. Who would have known that he would never return? Zhang's family waited until that evening but still did not see him come home. They knew something was wrong but did not dare to make it public immediately. At the same time, they sent out scouts, but for three days, there has been no trace of him, and there are no clues.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Someone Asked for a Loan <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Until yesterday, the family was at their wits' end and had no choice but to report the matter to the police station and ask for assistance. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. According to Zhang's family, in the ten days before the incident, someone had sent two letters using the envelopes and stationery of the Oriental Hotel, asking Zhang for a loan. The letters were signed with the surname "Xiao," but Zhang, having no connection with the sender, declined, saying that he was not at home. The original letters were immediately returned. According to general speculation, the case is bizarre and may be a kidnapping. Some people said that Zhang's disappearance may be the same as the previous kidnapping of the Korean Li Chunshan. We will record it to see what happens later. According to Zhang's nephew, who spoke to our reporter, Zhang usually stayed at home and had very few friends. Moreover, his family was poor and had no savings. When Zhang's wife returned to Japan for medical treatment, she borrowed 200 yuan from a friend for expenses. His sudden disappearance is really beyond our expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Creditors of Riyue Bank File a Lawsuit Against Partner Shareholders <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Should Bear Joint and Several Liability</p>
<p>The various details of the Gongfa Company, affiliated with the Shanghai Riyue Bank, declaring bankruptcy and liquidation since the death of its founder, Huang Chu Jiu, have been repeatedly reported in the previous newspapers. Now, creditors Xu Peiyuan, Heji, Wang Qitao, Pan Binji, Zhang Lieji, Liu Qishen, Cheng Kefan, Xie Shuji, etc., have recently hired lawyers Bian Jialu, Dong Yu, and Zhou Xiaoan to file a lawsuit with the Mediation Office of the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court. The main points of their application are: requesting confirmation of partnership, clarifying responsibilities, and facilitating liquidation matters. The applicants had previously deposited money into the Shanghai Riyue Bank. In addition to compensating for the liquidation of the company's assets, the remaining amount should be borne by the shareholders. However, since the liquidation of the case has exceeded three years, each creditor has only been allocated 20% of their claim, and the remaining executable assets are very small, making it difficult to compensate for the losses. The Gongfa Company was originally a partnership, which has been confirmed by the Supreme Court. When the partnership assets are insufficient to repay the partnership's debts, each partner is jointly and severally liable for the shortfall, as clearly stipulated in Article 681 of the Civil Code. Wang Yutai Tea Company, Huayang Pharmacy, Liu Jiaji, etc. are all partner shareholders of the Gongfa Company. Therefore, they request mediation to confirm that the respondents are partners of the Gongfa Company and should bear joint and several liability for the Gongfa Company's debts. The court has approved the request and held a hearing for mediation, which was adjourned. Yesterday morning, they were summoned again, and Judge Li Liang continued the mediation in Civil Court Seven. Wang Yutai was represented by lawyer Zhang Yaozeng, who denied joining the Gongfa Company as a shareholder. Huayang Pharmacy was represented by lawyers Li Guozhen and Lu Shifang, who stated that their client had purchased 300 yuan in stocks. However, the company was not legally registered and therefore has no legal effect under civil law. Since there is no legal registration, their client is not responsible. Liu Jiaji was represented by lawyer Wu Zhiping, who stated that their client had never bought shares in the Gongfa Company. Judge Li ordered them to leave and await another hearing.</p>

<p>Shen Baohe Lost 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>French Police Formally File Lawsuit</p>
<p>Shen Baohe, a Wuxi native, 33 years old, runs the Dexing Printing House at No. 7 Wenxian Lane, Lafayette Road in the French Concession. On April 8th of this year, Ji Pingshan, an acquaintance, told Shen that the Westerner Bai Lishi's foreign firm at No. 3 Huanlong Road needed a lot of account books and was willing to introduce him. At that time, for business purposes, Shen followed Ji. When they arrived at their destination, they waited in the reception room. After a while, a Chinese man, Pei Zhongying, came out to meet them. Ji introduced him to Shen. Pei claimed that he and the Westerner Bai Lishi could use magic to turn one yuan banknote into two one-yuan banknotes. If you used 1,000 yuan or 10,000 yuan banknotes, they could turn them into 2,000 or 20,000 respectively. But it had to be cash. Shen was fooled and driven by greed. He agreed to raise money immediately, so he went home and tried to borrow money from his brother Shen Baochang and friends.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>He managed to borrow 1,900 yuan in China Industrial Bank banknotes, 1,000 yuan in British gold pounds, and 3,200 yuan in various other bank notes, totaling 5,000 yuan. On the evening of April 25th, he went with Ji Pingshan to a Western-style house at No. 74 Huanlong Road, where Pei Zhongying and the Westerner Bai Lishi were waiting. Shen gave the money to them. They led Shen to a dark room, under the pretext of performing magic, and there was a loud bang, like a movie sound. After a while, the Westerner excused himself and left, and all the money had been taken away. At that time, Shen questioned Ji and Pei, and Ji and the others issued a letter of responsibility, stating that they would return the money the next day. Unexpectedly, they disappeared. Until the day before yesterday, Shen ran into Pei Zhongying on Yan Hai Street in the Chinese Concession and immediately called the police to arrest him. Under interrogation, because the incident occurred in the French Concession, the two parties were transferred to the French Police. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special District Court, and the police lawyer charged them with fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. Because the case was not yet clear, they requested an extension to investigate before another hearing. After a brief interrogation by the judge, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to investigate further.</p>

<p>Japanese National Fukuda Hiding Without a Trace</p>
<p>Chinese Associates Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Detectives Li Pengfei and Wu Shoushan of the Yulin Road Police Station, along with Western detectives, raided a red pill manufacturing factory at the Nishima Winery on Ningguo Road at 11:45 AM on the 27th of last month. They arrested five people, including Yao Fuyuan, Chen Bobiao, and Zheng Jinfa from Fujian, Li Zike from Anhui, and Wang Shixing from Changshu, and sent them, along with various machines and a large amount of medicinal powder, heroin, and morphine, to the First Special District Court. It was revealed that the factory was founded by a Japanese national named Fukuda, who is currently at large. The hearing was postponed to re-examine various aspects. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over a continuation of the hearing in Criminal Court Three. Industrial Board lawyer Li Zhishan stated that during the postponement, a notebook containing entry and exit figures was found in the home of the first defendant, Yao Fuyuan, in the French Concession. A ledger showing the start of construction of the factory was found in the small room where Chen Bobiao, accused of being at No. 117 Ningguo Road, lived. Yao, Chen, and Zheng claimed to have been associates with the Japanese national Fukuda. Li and Wang were hired personnel. There were many instruments in the factory. Photos have been taken and detailed accounts have been made. There were also three large bags of medicinal powder, which were tested by Industrial Board doctors and found to contain heroin and morphine. The ledgers, photos, and medicinal powder were presented. Fukuda, the Japanese national, is hiding and is now being prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. When questioned, the defendants' confessions were similar to their previous statements. Yao Fuyuan was represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping. Judge Liu ordered them to be remanded in custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>

<p>The Gatekeeper of Cihou Lane</p>
<p>Arrested Inside Hardoon &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Ji Juemi, the General Manager of Hardoon &amp; Co. on Nanjing Road, and a native of Xuzhou, had his family ancestral tomb in Panjiazhuang excavated by local bandits between November of last year and March of this year. The remains were stolen and hidden, and a letter was sent to the Ji family demanding a large ransom. Zhang Huaiqing, a Xuzhou native and leader of the bandits in the case, was arrested by the Yangshupu Police Station and sentenced to seven years in prison by the First Special District Court, where he is currently serving his sentence. Zhang's arrest was due to Qiu Yongzhi, the gatekeeper of No. 38 Cihou Lane on Hardoon Road, who had tricked him into coming to Shanghai from Wuxi. Because Suining County in Xuzhou found that Qiu was also involved in the damage to the tombs in Panjiazhuang, the General Patrol Office received an official letter from the county requesting his arrest. A warrant was issued to Detective Liu Xiangzhai of the First Special Court, who secretly went to Hardoon &amp; Co. on Nanjing Road to arrest Qiu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court One. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated the previous events, and when the defendant denied them, Chief Judge Qian Hongye ordered him to be remanded in custody, and Suining County was given two weeks to provide sufficient evidence for review.</p>

<p>Fear of Repeated Childbirth Failure</p>
<p>Parents Took Drastic Measures</p>
<p>At around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, Officer No. 1896 of the Putuo Road Police Station, while patrolling in Nanyinghua Lane on Laobasheng Road, discovered the body of a dead infant, estimated to be only three or four months old. The child's body was burned all over. The police station was notified and ordered detectives to investigate, and the child's body was taken to the Feilun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang was dispatched by the First Special Court to inspect and confirm the body. It was found that the deceased was a nameless infant whose body had been burned after dying of illness. There were no relatives. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial. Judging from the above, it must have been the parents who repeatedly failed to have children and took this superstitious measure to pray that their future children would be able to be cared for. Such cases have been seen many times in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Another New Large Wharf Completed in Shanghai <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Located in Lujiazui</p>
<p>Named Taitong Wharf</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of ships entering and leaving the port of Shanghai has increased day by day, and the demand for wharves and warehouses has exceeded the supply. Foreign freighters often have no place to dock. Chinese businessman Wang Zhongzhi and others have invested heavily in building a large wharf in Lujiazui, with warehouses attached. The wharf is seven or eight hundred feet long and can simultaneously dock one ocean-going vessel and one coastal vessel. The three warehouses have a huge storage capacity and are twenty-five feet deep at low tide, so even presidential liners and queen ships can dock without any problem. The project is nearing completion and is named Taitong. In addition, a railway track will be built on the wharf, directly connecting to the warehouses. Ships loading and unloading cargo can use machines to transport them to the warehouses (or from the warehouses to the ships), which will not only reduce huge handling costs but also speed up the process. The customs inspection room and office space in the warehouse have been completed one after another and are scheduled to start operations this month. It is also reported that the wharf will be managed by the American firm Shihua &amp; Co.</p>
<h3 id="e184">National Medicine Industry Entertains Reporters <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Opposing Ningbo Xiangbei Transportation and Sales Cooperative Speculating and Hoarding</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association hosted over twenty members of the Shanghai press last night. Committee member Cen Zhiliang reported, saying, "Esteemed gentlemen, our association has prepared a simple feast today, and we are deeply honored by your presence. The significance of inviting you here today is twofold. Firstly, since our association was established last August, we have had few opportunities to interact with you. Therefore, we would like to seek your guidance to improve our shortcomings. Secondly, we would like to take this opportunity to inform you about the actual situation of the Xiangbei incident, which is about to erupt, and ask you to provide fair criticism. Xiangbei is a specialty product of Zhangcun, Ningbo. Its uses have gradually expanded over the years, and its historical selling price has been approximately 40 to 80 yuan. Since the establishment of the Yin County Dongjiang Fritillaria Transportation and Sales Cooperative last year, the products have been concentrated in the cooperative, which has colluded with Baohe, Baosheng, Huiyuan, Maocheng, and other four medicine stores, monopolizing and speculating, hoarding goods to raise prices, and doing whatever they want. In three or four months, the price has soared to over 150 yuan. However, in reality, the farmers are still puppets, and there are also production restrictions planned to create a supply shortage. Our association firmly opposed this in the first meeting of member representatives last August. The cooperative and the four medicine stores sent representatives to Shanghai to invite Mr. Zhang Shenzhi and Mr. Fang Jiaobo, fellow Ningbo natives, to mediate. An agreement was signed at that time, in which the second clause stated that 'any increase or decrease in production and agreement on prices must be discussed and implemented with the participation of our association representatives,' which is the spirit of the entire agreement. However, the cooperative and the four medicine stores actually used primitive methods to restrict production, causing panic in the market. At the same time, the price suddenly rose to over 300 yuan, increasing the burden on patients and disregarding the contract. The national medical community in this city unanimously believes that this behavior needs to be corrected. Our association has now decided not to purchase Xiangbei, and various national medical organizations have also notified their members to use Qianhu as a substitute. Our association hopes to restore the original situation after achieving a considerable result, otherwise, we will persist to the end and never abandon our position."</p>
<h3 id="e185">National Medical Organizations Discuss the Monopoly of Xiangbei <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Xiangbei is one of the national medicines, produced in Yin County, Zhejiang Province. The price per dan has traditionally been 30 to 40 yuan, up to 60 to 70 yuan. Since the establishment of the Yinjiang Fritillaria Transportation and Sales Cooperative, Xiangbei has been centrally transported and sold, prohibiting farmers from selling freely. This year, production was further restricted, prohibiting the digging of Xiangbei that should have been unearthed in April, resulting in an increase in the price per dan to over 300 yuan. The Shanghai national medicine industry believes that this kind of monopolistic means directly increases the cost of the industry and indirectly increases the burden on patients. If various medicinal material producing areas follow suit, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, they requested assistance from national medical organizations. The Shanghai Municipal National Medical Association, Shanghai National Medical Society, Shenzhou National Medical Society, and中华 National Medical Society jointly sent a letter to the cooperative to inquire, but have not yet received a reply. Therefore, representatives were elected last night to meet at the National Medical Association to decide on sanctions, hoping to act in unison with the national medicine industry.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Tobacco Exchange Industry Again Requests Reduction of License Tax <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Before the Re-examination is Completed</p>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Fines</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai tobacco and alcohol license tax has been taken over by the Finance Bureau, the two types of ding tobacco and bing alcohol must be rectified according to regulations and changed to bing and yi levels. Various small tobacco exchange shops believe that the doubled tax is too heavy and claim that they cannot afford it. They have asked the association to earnestly request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask the Finance Bureau to verify and reduce the collection. The association petitioned the Chamber of Commerce on the 29th of last month and discussed relief measures. The previous list of names was sent to the Finance Bureau for review and reduction. Those who have not yet reported should be notified again to submit a supplementary report within one week, stating the reasons for being unable to afford the tax, so that the request can be forwarded. According to the Shanghai South Office of the association, after issuing a notice on its own, those who reported for registration in the past few days were very crowded and did not stop until 6 pm. The deadline is today, and the list will be completed and reported tomorrow. It is also reported that investigators from the Tax Collection Office are urging various shops to pay the increased tax and threatening to issue licenses within three days, otherwise, they will be fined. After the association received the report, it publicly appointed Chen Liangyu and Zhang Songji to visit the Municipal Chamber of Commerce again tomorrow to ask Chairman Yu to earnestly request the authorities to exempt them from fines before the re-examination of the added tax amount is completed.</p>

<p>Jiufu Company Still Maintains Victory in Trademark Law</p>
<p>Jiufu Company's various Tonic Pills are very effective in treating the lungs and strengthening the body, surpassing all other medicines. The American company Pade has constantly been involved in disputes with it over the Palette trademark. Until the beginning of the year, the position of Tonic Pills in trademark law, through the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan and the decision of the Ministry of Industry, Jiufu Company finally won the final victory. Unexpectedly, Pade Company still appealed to the Executive Yuan recently, but because its reasons were weak and insufficient to shake the final ruling, it was rejected. Jiufu Company still maintains the victory in the Tonic Pills trademark. It is also heard that Jiufu Company's Tonic Pills, in addition to the original pure and containing Jiguai types, has also added three types containing iodine, arsenic, and quinine, making a total of five types. Among them, the pure type is necessary for those with weak bodies, the type containing Jiguai treats coughs and pulmonary tuberculosis, the type containing iodine is suitable for various chronic diseases, the type containing arsenic is suitable for blood deficiency and neurasthenia, and the type containing quinine is suitable for those with a bad taste. Each has miraculous effects, so sales are very large.</p>

<p>Liu Jinfa, a 21-year-old from Hangzhou, lives at No. 22 Rusheng Lane, Wuhua Road, under the jurisdiction of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District of Zhabei. He has been working as a laborer in a nearby silk weaving factory. At about 9:30 pm last night, Liu felt stuffy in the house and was cooling off at the door. At that time, his neighbor, a hooligan named Shen Laosan, was also outside enjoying the cool and chatting with two or three of his kind. Unexpectedly, they started fighting over a disagreement. However, Shen Laosan was no match for the crowd, so in desperation, he pulled out the gun he was carrying and fired at the other hooligans. Unexpectedly, those hooligans saw the opportunity and dodged. Liu Jinfa was behind them and could not escape in time. The bullet hit Liu's abdomen, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Shen Laosan and others saw that they had caused trouble and fled one after another. By the time the nearby police officer arrived, they had already escaped far away.

<p>Chinese typing and Chinese shorthand are two major inventions of modern times. Not only do various institutions in the country hire personnel in these fields to save money and time, but also factories and foreign firms established by foreigners have purchased machines one after another and entrusted Yu Binqi, the inventor of the Chinese typewriter, and Yang Bingxun, the inventor of Chinese shorthand, to find specialized talents. Mr. Yu and Mr. Yang, in view of this, in addition to cooperating with various famous schools in Shanghai, have recently jointly established a Chinese Typing and Shorthand School in Shanchang Lane, Kad Road, to teach the knowledge of both subjects and create experts proficient in both. Fearing that students' foundations in Chinese studies are weak, unfamiliar with official document formats, and unable to obtain superior positions, they have specially hired Mr. Hu Tiewu as the dean of the school. Mr. Hu has held important positions in both political and academic circles, and his students number in the thousands. This time, as he presides over academic affairs, he will definitely develop more. Moreover, in order to achieve the purpose of applying what they have learned, the school guarantees employment for all graduates. It is heard that the school only accepts 20 students, and the quota is almost full. Classes are scheduled to start on the 17th of this month.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I was extremely surprised to read a news item in your esteemed newspaper of the 4th of this month stating that the Mainland Bazaar would be adding an amusement park. Upon investigation, the design of our bazaar is that the storefronts are along the road, the second floor is the bazaar, and the third floor and above are all office spaces. Major commercial establishments in Shanghai, appreciating the grand architecture and superior location, are vying to rent, and the office spaces are particularly in short supply. Recently, we have added dozens of new-style office spaces on the seventh floor, which have been completed and are now being rented. There is no plan to add an amusement park. Fearing that rumors outside are untrue, we hereby issue a special letter of correction to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Mainland Bazaar Office. 23.9.4.</p>

<p>(2) Book Introductions······ (Continued)</p>
<p>(3) This Week's Broadcast</p>
<p>2. Introducing the September Issue of "Middle School Student"</p>
<p>"Middle School Student" magazine, anyone who is even slightly concerned about regular periodicals probably already knows it, right? It has a five-year history, and has not only become the only extracurricular reading for middle school students, but also a good companion for general shop assistants, apprentices, and other amateurs. As long as you have a high school education, you can understand it.</p>
<p>The articles in this September issue are worth our special attention; such as Jin Zhonghua's "From Learning to Application" which starts from the current situation where the Tianjin University graduates are forming an employment alliance asking for help from all parties, and discusses the social origin of the contradictory phenomenon of the outflow of current school graduates, or learning that is not used, and "using what is not learned". It is extremely insightful and thorough. Mao Dun's "The Iliad and the Odyssey" is the first article in the series of lectures on famous literary works that began in this issue. Have readers who love literature heard of these two of the world's oldest literary masterpieces? But China does not yet have a translated version (the Odyssey has recently been published by the Commercial Press), and even when mentioned, it is very brief. Here, using extremely popular means, the author discusses the era of the original work, the artistic skill of the author, the content of the story, and similar works in literary history (this is according to the editor's postscript, because this issue has not been completely published). If this lecture starts from ancient times until recently, it will become a very popular history of literature. Zhang Mingyang's International Politics Lectures started in the January issue of this year. Each issue is an article, and each article is independent. It is good to read them together, but it is also okay to separate them. This issue is an article on the issue of war debts. This issue has been a very serious issue on the international stage in the past ten years, and you can almost see it every time you open the newspaper. But what exactly is the content of this issue? Why is it so serious and delayed for more than ten years without a solution? Or maybe many readers are wondering? Then this article is the answer to these questions. I know that there are many readers who are studying social sciences. Most of what is said in ordinary books are general principles and past events. If you want to connect what you have learned with everything in reality and get a thorough understanding, then you must read this type of article and the news in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Regarding natural sciences, this issue has Gu Junzheng's "Talk about Tides" and Xu Chunfang's "Old Studies Lectures", both of which are narrated in a storytelling tone, which is very interesting to read, and completely different from the boring and dullness of general textbooks. The remaining essays, occasional talks, cultural news, etc. are all like this, and we can call them "scientific essays." The final English column is also newly added this year, which is very helpful for those who are studying English on their own.</p>
<p>In short, the aspects included in this are very broad. Although the length is not very long, they are all very exciting. Although readers have different interests, they can all obtain the spiritual food they need.</p>

<p>Railways hold the hub of a country's transportation. In addition to solving some transportation and national defense issues, they are responsible for promoting social and economic policies. For example, railways in the East and West have very low ratings for industrial raw materials and people's daily necessities, and charge extremely low freight rates to help promote the prosperity of the national economy. Judging from the current national situation in our country, the bankruptcy of the rural economy has plunged all industrial and commercial enterprises into a state of decline and ruin, which is a injury to the entire national and national life. If we want to enrich national strength and turn the national fortune around, we must concentrate the thoughts, minds and talents of the entire country to restore the rural economy. This principle has long been recognized by the people of the country. Even the government is also using this as a starting point in its planning and thinking. Therefore, how to solve the rural economic problem, at the present stage, is the center of the entire social and economic policy, and the railway must assist in the implementation of this policy, in order to not fail its mission. Whether it is state-owned or private, it is its due obligation, and there is no room for hesitation or observation. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Scores for Each Subject are Currently Being Calculated</p>

<p>The supplementary examination held by the Municipal Education Bureau for middle school students in this city who were unable to participate in the joint examination due to illness or other reasons, or who did not finish the examination, has already been completed. The reason for the delay in grading all the supplementary examination papers was that some of the committee members in charge of grading had left for their hometowns or returned to their native places, and were unable to complete the grading of the papers on schedule. After repeated reminders from the Municipal Education Bureau, they finally finished reading the papers in detail yesterday (the 3rd). The Municipal Education Bureau is now rushing to calculate the scores for each subject and expects to finish in about two or three days.

<h3 id="e211">The Second Batch of Summer Military Training in This City Will Soon Be Completed <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Director Jiao Has Been Personally Inspecting the Various Schools in Recent Days</p>
<p>He Spoke Freely Yesterday About Various Issues Regarding Military Training in Schools in This City</p>
<p>The second batch of summer military training for high schools and above in this city is about to be completed. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited Jiao Jihua, the director of the National Military Training Committee, and spoke freely about various issues regarding the implementation of national military education in this city for over an hour. The key points are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Second Batch of Military Training Will Soon Be Completed <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the situation of the second batch of military training in this city. According to him, the second batch of summer military training in schools in this city, which started around the 20th of last month, will be completed within this week, after two weeks. He had visited various schools in recent days to inspect the results, which were generally satisfactory. However, due to the impact of various issues such as school funding and the allocation of instructors, shortcomings were inevitable. However, the spirit is especially important. To achieve good results in military training, the first year must inspire the students' spirit, make them understand that to preserve Chinese culture, it is necessary to first develop the national defense forces, and that young students should stand at the forefront to lead the general public. If they can understand this principle and receive military training, the effect will be significant. In addition to the government's strict implementation, it also depends on the school authorities' promotion and the society's encouragement to promote students' awareness, so as to achieve the purpose of implementing military training.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Full Implementation Starting This Semester <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Jiao also said that national military training includes a wide range of aspects and is not limited to military training in schools. Military training for merchants and workers should also be implemented. However, due to the lack of a fixed group and a strict organization among the industrial and commercial sectors, as well as various factors such as funding, it will be difficult to realize in the short term. Therefore, the central government will first start with schools in the first year of national military education in various places. Currently, there are only over thirty schools in this city that have military training, including universities and high schools. There are more high schools and above in the city than this number. Therefore, the schools that have not received military training will implement it across the board starting this semester. The military instructors for each school will be dispatched by the General Training Headquarters in the coming days to serve.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Schools Are Not Allowed to Use Instructors Privately <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Regarding students in schools who fail military training, they should comply with the ministry's order and strictly enforce it, and not allow them to be promoted. Secondly, military instructors should not be hired privately. Military instructors cannot be treated the same as science teachers. The science taught by science teachers is the same principle in all countries, but military science differs from country to country. For example, the organization and tactics have special training. Therefore, the central government requires that military instructors for each school must be submitted to the Military Affairs Committee for approval, and graduates of the instructor training class should be sent to fill the positions, and each school must not appoint them without authorization, in order to achieve uniformity.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Change the Training Method Next Year <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Finally, when the reporter asked whether the summer military training next year would still be conducted in the same way as this year, it was said that the Ministry of Education and the General Training Headquarters had consulted on the matter and decided that, starting next year, all first-year high school and first-year university students must receive three months of centralized training from April to July. The intention is to have the high school and university students complete their military training at once after enrollment, instead of the staggered approach of the past. This training cultivates ordinary soldiers in high school and military officers in universities. Currently, this city lacks barracks for centralized training, and preparations are actively underway for the implementation of centralized military training next year.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Members of the China Science Society Return to Shanghai from Jiangxi After the Annual Meeting <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xiaoshu Said That the Achievements of This Year's Annual Meeting Were Very Good</p>
<p>The Public in Nanchang Has a Strong Interest in Science</p>
<p>The 19th annual meeting of the China Science Society, held in Guling, Nanchang, closed at the end of last month. Members from various provinces and cities have left Jiangxi one after another. The Shanghai delegation, except for Hu Gangfu, Ding Xielin, Zou Bingwen, and others who remained in Nanking to attend the annual meetings of the Physics Society and the Agronomy Society, included General Secretary Yang Xiaoshu, Director Hu Xianfu, Wu Liande, and others, a group of over ten people, who returned to Shanghai by boat yesterday afternoon. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Mr. Yang Xiaoshu, the general secretary of the society. According to him, over 200 members attended this year's annual meeting, and the number of papers reached over 120, setting a record for the annual meeting. The joint participation of the three societies of Geography, Zoology, and Botany further enhanced the academic atmosphere. The conference lasted for a week, and there were thorough discussions on how to connect with specialized societies in the future and expand scientific propaganda. The results were very satisfactory. As for the location of the next annual meeting, the Guizhou provincial government sent many letters and telegrams and also sent Ma Junwu, the president of Guangxi University, to personally invite them. Therefore, it was decided to hold the meeting in Wuzhou. At that time, five societies including Physics and Chemistry will participate, and its grand scale can be predicted. The annual meeting closed on the 26th. Some members went to Nanchang to give public lectures, including Wu Liande and others who lectured on economic construction and other issues at the Nanchang New Life Promotion Association, and Bing Zhi, Wang Jiaxi, and Lu Yudao who lectured on middle school science teaching methods at the Jiangxi Education Department, totaling ten lectures. The audience exceeded 10,000, which shows that the public in Nanchang has a strong interest in science. Since the implementation of the New Life Movement in Nanchang, it has been solemn, clean, and orderly, with excellent order. The bandit areas that have been recovered are now actively being constructed, and the special education being implemented is particularly effective.</p>

<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers' School in Jiangwan, this city, has been established for over ten years and has an excellent reputation. Therefore, even in this time of national economic depression, those who study physical education still flock to the school. It is reported that due to the drought, the number of new students in various schools has decreased sharply this year, but the school's grand situation is not diminished, which is due to the perfection of its equipment, the seriousness of its teaching, and the excellence of its career prospects. The school started on the 1st and classes started on the 3rd. Students who were recommended from afar and those who could not make it to the entrance exam on time are still en route.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The Problem of Civic Education in National Revival (3) by Zhang Yuanruo <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, later scholars not only failed to understand Confucius' profound and extensive principles of civic education, but also outwardly complied and inwardly disobeyed, completely burying Confucius' legacy, leading to the daily decline of public morale and the weakening of national power. If the doctrines and principles of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius could be promoted and developed generation after generation, I believe that China today would not only not be so weak, but would have become the strongest country in the world. If you think my words are too grand and baseless, just look at Japan to be convinced. There are many reasons why Japan is so strong, but one important reason is that they were able to inherit our inherent culture and develop it, which created the foundation for Japan's strength (see Dai Jitao, "On Japan"). However, we Chinese ourselves could not inherit our own inherent culture and develop it to strengthen ourselves, but instead allowed others to inherit it and strengthen their country, which is extremely regrettable. In form, our country has always respected Confucius, but in reality, it is not Confucius who dominates the thinking of the Chinese people, but Lao Tzu (the reasons for this need to be explained in another article, which cannot be detailed here). Lao Tzu's thought is a philosophy of extreme individualism. Because this philosophy is extremely individualistic, it is extremely selfish and extremely passive. Because of the result of this extremely selfish and extremely passive individualistic education, it denies human relationships, denies the organization of the state, and destroys social morality. Therefore, although the Chinese nation has a history of more than 4,000 years, it is still scolded as an unorganized country. The reason why our country is unorganized is because it has been poisoned by this extremely selfish and extremely passive individualism, so that the general public not only do not know the responsibilities they should bear to the state and society, but also completely destroy our country's inherent education for organizing the state and managing society.</p>
<p>By the time of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties, this extremely selfish and passive individualism became even more corrupt and intensified. The people at that time only sought personal comfort, ease, and enjoyment, and the decadent and romantic nature of individualism became even more intensified. Because of the development of the decadent and romantic nature of individualism, the social activity of our people disappeared, and the sense of social responsibility also disappeared. At the same time, the people's desire for upward mobility also completely disappeared. At that time, the people showed no spirit of responsibility and upward mobility. Therefore, the Chinese people's inherent spirit of creating culture and cherishing the country and society was completely suppressed by this decadent and romantic nature of individualism, and it became a powerful evil force in history that dominated our national life. This evil force has since dominated China for thousands of years.</p>
<p>By the late Qing Dynasty, when foreign forces invaded and the national power declined, there was a so-called Reform Movement. The characteristics of the Reform Movement are two. First, the so-called "Chinese learning for the foundation, Western learning for application." The so-called Western learning for application is to strengthen armor, sharpen weapons, and expand military preparations. However, the activity of our people has been almost completely lost. Even with sharp guns, it is impossible to use them. Second, Kang Youwei's reform. He thought that if the country was to be strong, it would only be necessary to change the law. Kang's theory also failed to address the root cause. Because the evil force that has dominated our national character for thousands of years, in other words, is the decadent and romantic nature of individualism that is not upward, not responsible, and not striving. If it is not eradicated from the root, reform is in vain. The result will inevitably fail. Therefore, the Reform Movement still failed to revive China in the end. Japan's Reform Movement was at the same time as ours, but they succeeded. The reason for their success is that they were able to focus on the essentials and cultivate their national strength. However, our Reform Movement failed to start from the root and failed to fundamentally transform the inferior nature of our people, so that they could move upward and strive forward. Naturally, there was no possibility of success. Later, Mr. Liang Qichao founded the "New Citizen Journal" and advocated the theory of the New Citizen. He wanted to fundamentally reform the nation and revitalize the people's hearts. He can be said to be my comrade. His remarks published in the "New Citizen Journal" at that time, such as advocating public morality, martial spirit, patriotism, altruism, adventure, and introducing Western academics, were all very important. However, although Mr. Liang Qichao's articles were very sharp and his spirit was very magnificent, did they really touch the hearts of the people of the whole country? I think most of you present have read Mr. Liang Qichao's articles. When you read his articles, you must have been moved by him. However, our many sentient beings in the whole country were still indifferent and unmoved. This is because his advocacy did not penetrate the people universally, so he still failed to save our nation. This is what I especially want to hope that all of you teachers present will pay close attention to and continue to work hard on.</p>
<p>Since then, the people of the country, in view of the failure of the imperial examination system, have also advocated new learning. However, after advocating new learning, a new morbidity has occurred, which is the Europeanization that does not conform to national conditions. Because this kind of Europeanized education does not meet the needs of our nation, does not understand the history, national conditions, and characteristics of our inherent culture, the result is that the general public in China do not even know the names of various places in their own country, but know the place names of various Western countries. Even the textbooks on civics, history, and geography in their own country are adopted from foreign versions without selection. The most absurd thing is that the teachers of general universities, and even some middle schools, blindly use foreign languages in their lectures, questions, and school announcements. Therefore, what is trained by this kind of extreme Europeanized education is not Chinese citizens, but docile people who believe in the West. Can this new education revive the nation? Can it inspire the people's strong feelings for the country and the nation? Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel very sad. The May Fourth New Culture Movement originally bore a very important mission of the times. If it could be guided properly and carried out in a down-to-earth manner, it might not be an opportunity for the revival of our nation. However, unfortunately, a ghost followed this movement, which is romantic and uninhibited liberalism. Therefore, the Chinese nation still did not break away from the domination of the decadent and romantic nature of traditional individualism. Therefore, the May Fourth New Culture Movement did not produce any effect in the end. Until now, the situation in all aspects of the country and society has become increasingly deteriorated. You are all primary school teachers. What do you think of the current education compared to the past? How are the academic styles of the past and the present, the advantages and disadvantages? Social discipline, etc., are also getting worse and worse. The reason for this is probably the result of the trouble caused by liberalism, individualism, and romanticism. However, most people in society are still vaguely dominated by this extreme romanticism and are not aware of it. How can such a nation cheer up and generate strength?</p>
<p>I have now roughly reviewed this complex history from Yao, Shun, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou to the New Culture Movement. From this historical process, we can see through the reasons for the decline of our nation. The historical reasons for the decline of this nation, briefly speaking, on the one hand, are that the principles of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, those who organized the state, organized society, and educated the people, have not been promoted and developed, while on the other hand, Lao Tzu's extremely self-interested individualism has dominated the hearts of the people for thousands of years, so that our people cannot have a relationship with society and the country, nor can they fulfill their responsibilities and exert their strength. Therefore, we only see the development of the decadent and romantic nature of individualism and selfishness, but do not see the people's sense of responsibility, upward mobility, and activity towards society and the country. This is the reason why the Chinese people cannot generate strength, and it is also the historical reason for the decline of our Chinese nation (see my book "The Road to Chinese Social Movement," published in the first issue of "Chinese Society" and Volume 5, Issue 1 of "Prospects").</p>
<p>3. The Reasons for the Development of Various Nationalities and the Observation of Their Citizenship. The Reasons for the Decline of the Chinese Nation Have Been Described Above. However, Why Can the Nationalities of Various Countries in the World Be Strong? The Reasons for This Are Worth Studying. Let's First Look at the Situation of the Western Nationalities. Whether They Are Large or Small, Western Nationalities Are Generally Very Strong. Even a Small Country Like Belgium Can Resist Germany, and Its Performance in Construction Is Admired by Various Countries. We Examine the Reasons for the Development of Their Nationalities. There Are Three.</p>
<p>1. The Development of Nationalism. Since the 19th century, nationalism in various Western countries has been greatly developed. Scholars in their countries have spared no effort in promoting nationalism. The most famous ones are Massii of Italy, Fichte, Hegel, Sauigng, Eluing, Eluntochli, Palman of Germany, and Raman and Larmati of France. Scholars and writers have all worked hard to promote nationalism in literature, political commentary, and law, and to arouse the national consciousness of the people. However, scholars and writers in our country mostly do not ask about politics, do not know the country, or indulge in poetry and wine, or play with things and lose their ambitions, or create new ideas and confuse the masses. Most of them lack strong national emotions. Therefore, in the past 100 years, there have been strong national movements in various European countries from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. These are all the achievements of their scholars and writers in working hard to promote the development of nationalism. Among them, the unification of Germany and Italy is the most important and spectacular historical event. However, we are still divided and fighting civil wars. Each of us is showing our selfish wisdom and disregarding the overall situation.</p>
<p>2. The Development of Social Morality. The Development of Social Morality Is Very Trivial to Talk About. I Can Only Briefly Talk About It Now. The So-Called Social Morality Is Actually Confucius' "Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Trustworthiness." Unfortunately, It Has Not Developed in China, But Has Run to the West to Develop. Various Western Countries Do Not Have Confucius, But They Have Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Trustworthiness. Although We Chinese Have Confucius, We Do Not Have Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Trustworthiness. This Is Why the Republic of China Is Declining, Chinese Society Is Chaotic, Western Nationalities Are Rising, and Western Society Is Well-Governed. I Remember When I Returned to China from Europe in the Past, I Was Invited to Give a Lecture for the First Time. The Chairman Asked Me to Tell Them About the Prosperous Situation in Foreign Countries. I Felt Very Pained at That Time and Said at the Beginning That You Will Definitely Be Disappointed After Listening to What I Am Going to Say Today. I Am Unwilling to Tell Everyone About the Prosperous Situation of Foreign Countries, Because the Material Civilization of Foreign Countries and the Extravagant Situation of Foreign Countries Have All Invaded Our Central Land. Just Go to Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou to See. You Can Understand It, So You Don't Need to Talk About It Anymore. What I Am Going to Talk About Today Is What We Chinese Ourselves Have Been Lost to Other Countries. There Is a Best Thing in Our Chinese History, Which Is Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Trustworthiness, Which Is Confucius' Legacy. However, We Chinese Cannot Find Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Trustworthiness Now. China Is Now Unkind, Unrighteous, Imprudent, and Untrustworthy, While Foreign Countries Have This Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Trustworthiness. Since I Met This National Treasure Lost to Other Countries in Foreign Countries, I Cannot Help But Report to You. I Feel That the Reason Why Western Society Has Developed Is Because of the Development of Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, and Trustworthiness. "Benevolence" Is a Kind of Social Sympathy. This Spirit of Westerners Is the Most Developed. It Can Be Seen Everywhere. Unlike Us Chinese Who See Someone Fall on the Road, We Not Only Do Not Help Him Up, But Also Clap Our Hands and Laugh. Speaking of "Righteousness," Chinese People Are Lazy and Avoid Difficult Things, and There Is No Spirit of Righteousness and Courage. However, the Westerners' Style of Righteousness Is Very Strong. Not to Mention Other Things, Just Look at Their Righteousness to the Country and the Nation. They Are Extremely Righteous. For the Country, the Nation, and the Society, They Are Willing to Spare No Time and Sacrifice, and They Are Willing to Go Through Fire and Water. Let's Look at the Foreigners in Shanghai Again. They Are Very Helpful in Fighting Fires. The Foreigners in Shanghai Are Actually Far Less Than Those Living in Their Own Country. However, They Still Have Such Righteousness. You Can Imagine the Morality of Their Own People.</p>

<p>By J. PARML PARET, Translated by Qian Yiqin and Hong Jun</p>

<p>Swing the arm backward from the front of the body, and the racket should swing all the way behind the left shoulder. When swinging the racket forward to meet the incoming ball, it should be roughly equal to the height of the waist and slightly in front of the player's standing position. For backhand shots, try to swing forward as far as the right shoulder. When the racket and the ball first come into contact, the player's whole body – from the hips to the chest to the shoulders – should turn forward along with it. After the hitting action is completed, the player's face is almost facing the net. This kind of body rotation increases the power of the shot by adding weight and momentum.</p>
<p>When the incoming ball faces the wrist twist, just like in the forehand shot, the ball must rotate forward. At this time, the string should drag across the ball, and the surface of the ball is brushed, thus producing a rotating motion. This is the special technique of this style, which makes the ball fly forward in a rotating manner, that is, increasing the air pressure above the ball and reducing the air pressure below the ball. Therefore, when the ball flies forward, it has a tendency to fall faster and hits very heavily. The ball still does not fly over the boundary line.</p>
<p>When the backhand topspin is completed, the racket should swing to a place higher than when the shot started. Because this kind of shot, the racket is swinging upward. The time for the racket to contact the ball should be extended as much as possible. After the ball has left the string and flew away, the right arm should swing to the right side as much as possible, using the momentum to the fullest. Because the weight and shoulders are swinging to the right side as much as possible, and the right arm is also stretching straight to the right side as much as possible, the momentum can be fully used up.</p>
<p>When this type of shot is completed, the real position where the racket stops its power varies from player to player according to the momentum of the twisting ball. Some players extremely twist the racket to a level above the horizontal of the right shoulder. There are also very few players who only swing the racket to a position above a semicircle and stop. However, their power to twist the ball is much weaker. This is very obvious.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the backhand topspin is much more difficult than the forehand topspin. However, some players who specialize in practicing this technique find it easy. Years ago, there was a newly famous player who simply liked to use the backhand to meet the incoming ball. This player's name was Pell T.R. Pell. He invented extremely sophisticated techniques and power for the backhand topspin, and simply using this technique has enabled him to win many leagues many times.</p>
<p>Speaking of the backhand slice or backhand chop, it is much easier than the backhand topspin. The backward swing of the racket is not as far as the topspin, but it should be slightly higher. When shooting forward, the angle is slightly downward, so the contact between the ball and the racket is a sweeping shot from below. Naturally, the racket is lowered more after the shot, and this sweeping shot from below makes the string rub and rotate the ball at the bottom of the ball, so the ball flies forward and dies backward.</p>
<p>Because the racket must pass under the ball, the position where the racket stops after the backhand slice is not only different, but also the angle at which the racket face slopes back is also different.</p>
<p>As for the position where the racket swings after the chop shot is completed, it will be even lower. The difference between the slice and the chop is in the method of spinning the ball differently. When chopping downward, the racket only needs to be slightly angled backward. When shooting, it is diagonally chopped from top to bottom, and the sweeping power is also greater. Therefore, the racket falls even lower. As for the slice, the racket should be angled backward even more, and then hit straight out, but the swing of the shot is less.</p>
<p>The backhand slice is an amazing defensive method. If you can practice it to the same technique as Tilden, it can even be regarded as a dangerous attack method. Because the ball's swing process is shorter, the preparation time for the shot is also less, so the aiming direction to the opponent can be hidden, making it impossible for the opponent to predict. The player can also control the racket more easily. As long as the wrist is slightly changed, the direction of the shot can be changed, which is much more flexible than other shooting techniques.</p>
<p>When the player is forced back by the opponent to the far left corner of the court to meet the incoming ball, the player should use the chop, which can turn danger into safety. If other techniques are used at this time, there will inevitably be mistakes or the power of the return is very weak. When using the backhand topspin again, the player must retreat far behind the shooting position, which is in itself a weakness and not as convenient as the chop.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Starting from the Twenty-Four Histories <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>It seems that Liang Qichao once said that the Twenty-Four Histories are essential reading for Chinese scholars – whether they study engineering or agriculture. However, he also believed it was a last resort. He lamented that China did not yet have specialized histories or comprehensive histories, so people still had to rely on these private records of emperors, books of mutual destruction, and generally, piles of antiques. In his writings, he aspired to create a decent comprehensive history himself, but unfortunately, most of his energy was spent on being an official and playing cards. Whether his disciples accepted his remaining ambition is unknown, but it has been more than ten years since his promise, and those continuing his wish seem to be nowhere in sight. The fact that China still lacks a proper comprehensive history is why the Twenty-Four Histories remain important historical materials, and why they continue to circulate.</p>
<p>The enlightened nine-volume set of the Twenty-Five Histories is now available for pre-order. This approach is commendable in several ways. Compiling this massive work into just nine volumes makes people feel that it is not an unreadable book, subtly increasing their courage to read it. However, being able to read it is one thing, but what to do after reading the entire set is another. Horizontally, those who specialize in studying various aspects of a particular dynasty only need the historical books of that dynasty and the two dynasties before and after it. Therefore, for the convenience of these readers, the Twenty-Four Histories should not be sold as a complete set at all. Those who specialize in studying a particular aspect of each dynasty need only a portion of each history. For their convenience, the publication method should be changed. The former is not a significant problem, but the latter is worth noting.</p>
<p>The Astronomical Research Institute bought the complete Bai Na edition of the Twenty-Four Histories to study the astronomical records of past dynasties. However, they can only use the treatises on astronomy, treatises on the Five Elements, etc. The treatises on astronomy and the treatises on the Five Elements are truly unreadable or unnecessary for ordinary readers. Although it is not easy for us to newly compile a collection of astronomical history data, it is not difficult to compile and print all the treatises on astronomy and the treatises on the Five Elements from the Twenty-Four Histories. With a little more effort, taking the main contents from the Book of Han, the Book of Sui, and the History of Ming, noting the same text and different text from the other histories, and adopting the records of encyclopedias like the General Records, it would not be difficult to create a more usable book. Otherwise, reprinting them as they are would also be more convenient to use. It is generally accepted that the Twenty-Four Histories can only serve as reference books, and reference books should have the advantages of reference books.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Complete Collection of Illustrations of Books. Chinese encyclopedias are mostly classified. Since they are classified, they can be published separately. Because the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica has become so large that it is not needed for general use, in addition to the complete set, separate classified volumes are compiled and sold separately. We, on the other hand, have encyclopedias that are originally classified but must be sold as a complete set. The difference between progress and conservatism is truly too great. In fact, if the editions of the treatises on astronomy in the Twenty-Four Histories could be printed, then the sections on astronomy and calendrical methods in the Complete Collection of Illustrations of Books could be abandoned.</p>
<p>When reprinting the Twenty-Four Histories, at least the treatises and tables of each history should be compiled and printed separately (but genealogical records like the Zhao family genealogy in the History of Song should be deleted decisively, and only a catalog retained). The imperial chronicles and biographies could be arranged according to surnames, and a large dictionary of personal names could be compiled, with the original order of the books listed as an appendix. The foreign accounts – accounts of the Four Barbarians, the Xiongnu, the Western Regions – could also be compiled into separate volumes. Modern Western scholars of China have compiled all the materials on the Xiongnu, Turks, etc., from the Twenty-Four Histories into specialized books, and Chinese publishers are translating them back and selling them as new works. From the perspective of book merchants seeking profit, this is of course understandable, but from an academic perspective, it cannot but be considered a disgrace. If our reprint publishers of the Twenty-Four Histories were willing to compile them by country and include related texts, their achievements would be more than just a publishing revolution, but immortal achievements.</p>
<p>The redundancy in the Old and New Books of Tang and the Old and New Histories of Yuan would naturally disappear if the above method were followed. In fact, even without dismantling and recompiling the Twenty-Four Histories, it would be better to combine these two histories within one book, rather than having two overlapping books. Using the new as the main text, and editing the material from the old book, deleting the same material and annotating the different material under the same material, they could coexist and be easier to review, and the reduction in length would be a bonus.</p>
<p>The classified and recompiled Twenty-Four Histories would not change the essence of the original books in the slightest. Everyone could still find what they were looking for, the only difference being that it would be easier to find. This is not dissecting the original books, but rather gathering what was originally dissected. This should be a perfect solution, but no one has mentioned it so far, probably because those with a superficial understanding are unwilling to go to the trouble, while those with lofty goals feel that this is just a scissors-and-paste job. But I believe that without this scissors-and-paste work, the specialized histories and comprehensive histories of those with lofty goals will become increasingly distant.</p>
<p>The pricing of the nine-volume set is also considered very cheap, and their lack of focus on high profits is also commendable. However, if we are only talking about low prices, the binding prices for popular novels that are currently being reprinted seem to be able to be more than halved. But even if you can buy the Twenty-Four Histories for ten or eight yuan, the part that you don't need to read is a waste of money, and it is an especially irreplaceable loss if you don't know what you don't need to read and waste your energy reading it. If we can never have a well-recompiled Twenty-Four Histories, then that's fine, but if we can have a day when it is compiled, then another identical reprint would also be a waste. This reprint is probably irreversible now, but if there are those who want to reprint it again, we hope that they will not only think about competing with lower prices, but that there is actually a better way out in terms of compilation and distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e230">On Size <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ge</p>
<p>If someone is arguing about the issue of essays and popular language, then I am willing to provide some discussion materials...</p>
<p>What is large?</p>
<p>Generally, long articles are large pieces… short articles are essays. But looking at the writings of important people today, which often run to hundreds of thousands of words, are these large pieces? If you think those words are "large," then the literary world will know how to exert itself from now on. Just keep writing, the longer the bigger, the bigger the longer, you can break the world's record for works.</p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, poems of more than 10,000 words are rarely seen; Yu Chuan Sheng seemed to be writing desperately, like Bian Yun Yue Shi, but it doesn't seem that long; the memorable sentences are very simple, but poetry has never been considered an essay. It can be seen that specializing in form cannot distinguish size.</p>
<p>There are very short articles in ancient times, such as Ban Mengjian's Lezheng Ranming, Lanting Xu, and Taohuayuan Ji. Are these essays? These all seem to be large pieces. It is also difficult to distinguish the size of the content, because what is written is so different.</p>
<p>Then let's talk about Yuan Zhonglang. This type of writing is an essay. The content is about how to drink tea, eat, play with flowers and plants, and travel the mountains and rivers. But understanding the art of living is not just Zhonglang, talking about elegance is not just Zhonglang, this type of writing is not just Zhonglang who can write, there are so many people in ancient times who understood the art of living, especially in the Six Dynasties. It can be seen that you cannot use the writer as a standard.</p>
<p>Form, content, and writer cannot be used as standards, it can be seen that large pieces and essays are vain calculations and unnecessary disputes. But in the end, works can be distinguished as great or not, and this distinction lies in the work itself and the personality from which it originates.</p>
<p>Therefore, while writing essays, one may also oppose or hate "essays." Just as you can still scold people for talking while talking yourself. Commentators say that it is inappropriate to attack essays with essays, then attackers should write hundreds of volumes to attack "essays." Then writing an essay should support "essays."</p>
<p>There must be a day, then writing essays will really become "small," and then speaking loudly that this is really great, then what will become of it.</p>

<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(9) Specialization or Universalization?</p>
<p>Here, we encounter another big problem... Chinese language is very different in different places. With just a rough distinction, there are five kinds: Northern dialect, Jiangzhe dialect, Lianghu-Chuan-Gui dialect, Fujian dialect, and Cantonese. And within these five kinds, there are still small distinctions. Now, when using Latin letters to write, should we write in standard language or local dialect? If we write in standard language, people won't understand; if we write in local dialect, people in other places won't understand, and it will be isolated, not as good as the nationally-used Chinese characters. This is a big drawback!</p>
<p>My idea is... in the initial enlightenment period, each place should write in its own local dialect, without having to worry about not being understood by other places. Before the use of Latin writing, our illiterate people did not communicate with each other using Chinese characters, so there is no new harm added. On the contrary, there are new benefits, at least in the same language area, people can exchange opinions and absorb knowledge with each other -- of course, at the same time, someone has to write some useful books. The question is whether the popular language in each place should be specialized or universalized in the future?</p>
<p>In dialects and local languages, there are many profound words, which we call "refined words," and they are very meaningful to use, just like the use of classics in classical Chinese, and listeners also find it interesting... Each dialect, the grammar and vocabulary, should be further refined and developed, which is specialization. This is very beneficial to literature, it can make articles more interesting than articles using only general language. But specialization also has its dangers. I don't know about linguistics, but looking at biology, specialization often leads to extinction. Many animals and plants before humans became extinct because they were too specialized, lost their variability, and could not cope with changes in the environment, so they had to become extinct. Fortunately, we humans are not considered specialized animals, so please don't worry. The masses have literature, want literature, but should never be sacrificed for literature, otherwise, its absurdity and the living sages who want eight-tenths of the Chinese people to be illiterate to preserve Chinese characters are no different. Therefore, I think that dialects should be used in the enlightenment period, but at the same time, ordinary grammar and vocabulary should be gradually added. First use the inherent, is the popularization of a local language, adding the new, is the popularization of a national language.</p>
<p>The plans discussed by a few scholars in the study are of course mostly unworkable, but it is not a good idea to let everything take its course. Now, in the docks, public institutions, and universities, there is indeed something that looks like a standard language. Everyone speaks neither "Mandarin" nor Beijing dialect, and each carries a local accent and tone, but it is not a dialect. Even if it is difficult to speak and difficult to hear, it can always be said and understood. If it is sorted out and helped to develop, it is also a branch of popular language, and it may even be the main force in the future. I said that we need to add new things to the dialects - and the source of the new things is in this place. When this kind of thing comes out of nature and is artificially added - popularization, our popular language will be roughly unified.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have to do it after this. After a long time, the language becomes more consistent, and things that are as good as a 'refined word', and even more alive than the classics, gradually form, and literature becomes more brilliant. It can't be done right away. You think, the Chinese characters that national quintessence scholars regard as treasures, it didn't take three or four thousand years to create this pile of strange achievements?</p>
<p>As for the question of who should do it, that goes without saying... it is enlightened scholars. Some people say... "The affairs of the masses should be done by the masses themselves!" That is of course correct, but you have to see what role you are talking about. If you are talking about the masses, then there is one thing that is correct, that is, they have to do it themselves, and what is wrong is pushing away the helpers. If you are talking about scholars, then it is completely different; he is using beautiful words to control the text and protect his own honor.</p>

<p>"Child, come here, I'll tell you..."</p>
<p>Before she could speak, Yan's voice was already choked up. Seeing his mother in such pain, Zhongni quickly comforted her...</p>
<p>"Mom, it's okay to tell me in detail when you feel better."</p>
<p>"Your mother's illness won't get better! Child, regarding your father's matter, the mother of Man Fu (that person from Zou), she knows everything clearly."</p>
<p>Soon, Yan died. At that time, Zhongni was already twenty-four years old. He learned a little about the process of his parents' union from Man Fu's mother, as well as the location of his father's burial after his death. He buried his father's coffin and his mother's coffin together on the side of Fang Mountain. After the earthen grave was finished, Zhongni lay on the grave, wailing sorrowfully...</p>
<p>"Mom, I know everything clearly!"</p>
<p>"Boyu! Have you memorized the Songs of Zhou and the Songs of Zhao?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've memorized them long ago; what's the use of memorizing those mountain songs?"</p>
<p>"Child, human relationships and worldly wisdom, human relationships and worldly wisdom, this is all human relationships and worldly wisdom!"</p>
<p>"Dad, I'll recite it for you...</p>
<p>"Guan guan cry the ospreys,</p>
<p>On the islet in the river.</p>
<p>The modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady:</p>
<p>For our prince a good mate she is.</p>
<p>Here long, there short, is the duckweed;</p>
<p>To the left, to the right, they pluck it.</p>
<p>The modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady:</p>
<p>Waking and sleeping, he desired her.</p>
<p>He sought her and found her not;</p>
<p>Waking and sleeping, he thought about her.</p>
<p>Long he thought; oh! long and anxiously;</p>
<p>He turned and tossed about, never getting sleep."</p>
<p>Zhongni closed his eyes and listened quietly to Boyu's singing, tapping lightly on the table with his hand. Suddenly, he said as if he felt something...</p>
<p>"Boyu, you may leave!"</p>
<p>Boyu walked out of Zhongni's study, and Zhongni still heard his singing from afar...</p>
<p>"In the wild there lies a dead deer,</p>
<p>And it is wrapped up with white grass.</p>
<p>There was a young girl with thoughts of spring;</p>
<p>A good youth seduced her!</p>

<p>Zhongni said to himself in a low voice...</p>

<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Later, our troops were defeated, and that relative also didn't resolve anything, life in the hometown was even more difficult, and the small store at home had to close down, so my younger brother and I had to think of other ways to go. My younger brother entered a military academy again, and so did I. At this time, everyone would only play together on weekends. Although that strange temper was not thrown away.</p>
<p>I remember when he graduated, I told him I would buy him a leather belt. That day, while he hadn't come yet, I asked several classmates to go buy it together. Because we didn't have much money, we bought a medium one. When we were waiting for him in the park, I was very happy to give it to him, thinking that he would also be very happy; but he took the belt and looked at it, then looked at the widest belt he had borrowed to tie around his waist, his face suddenly turned green, his eyes straightened, he threw the belt on the chair with a snap, and turned to leave. My friends were all surprised. It made me want to jump up and hit him a few times, but I finally calmed down, pulled him back, and promised to buy him another one. He then sat down angrily in the midst of many surprised glances.</p>
<p>From then on, he was assigned to another unit, and we had no chance to meet. And my life also began to change rapidly.</p>

<p>Many fluctuations throughout the day</p>
<p>Result: A decrease of three yuan and one cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market fell due to the rise in the silver market, but confidence remained stable. Therefore, the day’s situation was very firm. In the early morning, due to the rebound in the overseas silver market and the two-pence increase in London bullion, the exchange rate also rose. The US market was closed for Labor Day, and confidence was slightly weak. The spot market opened and retreated to forty-five yuan and six cents. The gold industry's preparatory trading opened similarly. After the opening, the banks' appetite was still strong and stable, but supply and demand were quite balanced. Therefore, the rises and falls were quite frequent, but the difference was minimal. The sentiment was stable. The HSBC quoted that the British exchange rate was flat, and the US exchange rate only increased by 0.0625. The gold price could still be raised. After entering the market, the banks' appetite tended to be congested, and sellers in the market became eager. However, their strength was not strong. Therefore, although it fell, it did not fall much. The Guang bang bought US dollars, and the domestic market was stable. The gold market also had some buyers taking advantage of the low price, and it rebounded. The overall trend was very calm, lacking special stimulation. Supply and demand were balanced, and transactions were few. Afterwards, a stagnant situation lasted for a long time. At noon, the banks' appetite was oversupplied, and the potential trend loosened. Sellers became eager, and the situation was weaker. However, buyers could still maintain the price, and it remained stable after the low. The Central Bank once opened purchases of spot goods. The market sentiment remained stable afterwards, as the Central Bank was said to continue to purchase spot goods. The Chinese merchants aggressively bought forward orders, and the gold price rose. However, because Bombay telegraphed an increase of one or two annas, there was still a struggle. The sentiment was very firm, and there were not many transactions. The table was already dry, and the domestic market was slightly tight. The gold market rose again. Finally, Bombay did not move, and the market entered a rotational state. The market still showed an excess of demand over supply. Throughout the day, the rises and falls were very narrow, and there were many fluctuations. The potential trend was very firm.

At noon, the banks still had a selling appetite. Later in the market, the banks' appetite, although tightening due to Fook Cheung and Tai Kang Run Li acquiring shillings, did fluctuate slightly due to the Mumbai market rising by 1.2 annas.

<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market conditions were, on the surface, slightly calmer. The foreign short-term lending rate had also fallen to 0.02. Both the morning and noon markets traded at 0.14, which is a temporary fluctuation inherent in the market. In reality, the situation is mostly tight and not optimistic. Barely covering costs, with not much spending, positions were relatively loose and excessive. Therefore, the initial market opened at 0.02, and then even traded at break-even. The turnover of short-term bills in the morning market was over 3.8 million for transfers and new transactions, and over 300,000 in the noon market.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e238">Major Players Covering Short Positions, Public Debt Rebound Strength Not Weak <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>||Gains of Six, Seven Jiao to One Yuan, Sixty-Seven Jiao||</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, market prices continued to rebound, and the short sellers' stronghold showed signs of weakening. Foreign short-term lending was quoted at 0.14, and there were rumors of a continued shrinking trend. The overall environment appeared stable. The Southwest delegates' attendance at the Fifth Plenary Session was reportedly no longer an issue. The situation between Japan and Russia was gradually easing. The situation in North China was expected to improve significantly soon. Huang Fu's trip to the north was confirmed. The banks' savings reserves are being sealed today, causing panic among short sellers. Some from the north were covering short positions, and major players were also quite active in covering. Market prices rose repeatedly, showing a strong upward momentum. After a period of severe price declines, a rebound finally began. The One-Sixth Surtax bonds experienced the largest drop, so their rebound was expected to be more significant. Considering the outstanding amount of the One-Sixth Surtax bonds, which totaled over 30 million, the exchange office only issued 6 to 7 million new bonds this time. The difference has not been seen exchanged yet, but the number of deposit accounts has exceeded several times. The future for short sellers is expected to be particularly difficult, and those who are not careful will suffer unconscious losses. The overall trend is expected to be a significant upward surge, due to the large number of floating short positions. Yesterday, the market opened with a sharp rise of 1.25 yuan for demobilization bonds, and other bonds also gained several jiao to one yuan. Investor confidence was greatly boosted, and short sellers began to waver. The second session of demobilization and troop reduction bonds seemed slightly weaker, but the upward trend continued afterward, with gains of 0.2 to 0.75 yuan. It was expected that the market would decline at the close, but only one or two bonds declined slightly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, while the rest continued to rise, mostly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The One-Sixth Surtax bonds, however, continued to rise by about 0.7 jiao. As a result, market prices rose by 0.6 to 1.67 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 30 million yuan. The changes in prices are compared in the table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e239">Minimal Rebound in Marked Yarn Prices Due to Heavy Pressure from Warehouse Inventory <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, and the situation remained calm. Because most of the short sellers who had bought in regarded high market prices and resumed selling, although actual yarn sales were 1,000 bales, it was still difficult to stop the selling trend. In reality, without a proper solution for the inventory of goods in warehouses, the pressure remained heavy, and the market trended weak. However, after a large drop, there may be a period of consolidation, which is also possible.</p>

The market sentiment remained strong after the afternoon opening, and there were reports of 1,000 bales being transacted. Unexpectedly, the market suddenly fell after the second or third bids because speculators and Japanese merchants sold off due to rising prices. Market prices then declined, with each month falling by 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 jiao. The total transactions for the day were estimated at 36,000 bales. Da Feng sold 1,400 bales, Yuan Da 1,250 bales, Chang Yu 700 bales, Ren Feng 700 bales, Chang Feng 1,450 bales, Da Chang 450 bales, Xie Sheng 600 bales, Yong Chang 1,150 bales, and Xin Cheng 650 bales.

<p>||A Clear Trend Towards Decline||</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw extreme turbulence in all months after the morning opening. Although there was no quotation for foreign wheat, market sentiment showed a clear trend towards decline. Sales in North China were stagnant, and the routes to various towns and villages in the interior were blocked due to dried-up rivers, making it impossible to transport goods. As a result, the mooncake sales market, which usually occurs every year, was also cut off. Therefore, when pricing opened, the current month initially opened at 0.45, but later long positions were released, and prices gradually declined. In the distant months, non-industry long positions, seeing the unfavorable situation, also desperately sold off, with each month falling uniformly by 0.3 to 0.4 points compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the market in each month had changed drastically again. Because factories were selling off accumulated spot goods, the high-value long positions were swept away like leaves in a storm and could no longer resist. Therefore, the opening price immediately fell again, and the intensity of the trend was beyond expectations. The current month fell to a low of 0.3825, a huge decline of about 0.5 yuan from the previous month's highest and lowest. This irrational situation, where prices rise without reason and fall without reflecting reality, is something that all operators should repeatedly reflect on. October to January also fell below 0.5 yuan. February fell to the 0.51 level. Although Guangdong and Shandong merchants were buying, the rest were less active. As a result, the current month fell by 0.0625, October fell by 0.07, November fell by 0.08, December fell by 0.0775, January fell by 0.07, and February fell by 0.065.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed an extremely soft trend in all months after the morning opening. Although there was no quotation for foreign wheat, because factories had fewer purchases due to the abundance of spot wheat, people both inside and outside the industry lost interest in this situation. Those with goods either sought to sell them or entered into a standard agreement. Therefore, after pricing opened, the prices in each month were weak, falling by 0.07 to 0.08 compared to the previous day's closing price. By the afternoon opening, the market had fallen even more sharply. Due to the intense decline in the flour market and the free selling of outside long positions, each month went downhill like a river, without looking back. According to industry insiders' speculation, it is feared that rural bankruptcies will make it impossible to expect good commodity prices, and a further heavy decline is also possible. As a result, the current month fell by 0.16, October fell by 0.17, November fell by 0.19, December fell by 0.18, January fell by 0.16, and February fell by 0.14. It was heard that the asking price for spot wheat was 3.7 yuan, but the factories were less interested. According to experts, prices must return to 0.6 before they can be moved.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from each group still only had over ten vendors (totaling 1,500 shi). The market sentiment was relatively stable, and the market situation was turning stable. The prices of various japonica rice and late rice did not rise or fall, but late rice was softer than thick japonica rice, because the appetite for it was very limited. Now that the appetite for it has stopped, the market has little hope. As for new japonica rice, it has also turned stable following old japonica rice. Du Yangjian and Du Jian Yinbian Yuan, etc., were relatively soft.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from each route of Jiangnan had 8 or 9 vendors. The appetite for each commodity in the market remained bland. Market prices: white japonica rice was weak, the price of new Kejian remained small, and the prices of thin rice and old Yangjian were firmly fixed in the middle range. The price of Du Jian was down slightly by 0.1, and the price of old Kejian was soft. Dongxin japonica rice was stable.</p>

<p>Commodity houses seek to sell off期洋米</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign Ke Xian rice had brisk arrivals and sales, and the market atmosphere was extremely good. Furthermore, the Jiujiang merchants still had not met their quota, and their appetite for it was extremely active. The various Chongsha groups in this district and the interior also purchased Jiangxi rice because the Jiujiang merchants were paying attention to Xiang Ji rice, so Ji Jing rebounded by 0.2. The various milled rice was only inquired about by the Chongsha groups in the interior and this district, with the price increasing by several points and 0.1. Only this district was interested in foreign rice, because the rice merchants had already settled orders directly, and pre-ordered and transit goods had arrived one after another, and the market was only maintaining a level. It was weak to see commodity houses with holdings seek to sell off future foreign rice. A total of 4,000 packages of Xiang rice, 3,700 packages of Shashi and Hankou rice were put up for sale, along with more than 1,700 packages of foreign rice. Commodity houses for the west Saigong rice were watching, and commodity houses were seeking to sell the commodity. Moreover, the producing area reported small, and foreign merchants continued to solicit, so the market was not as firm as Ke Xian rice.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the second shipment of Changzhou cowhide yellow soybeans arrived on the market. These soybeans started late and have received rain, so their color is still good, but they are slightly flattened and thin. It should be evaluated higher than the first batch by more than 0.5 yuan, but it is still inferior to previous years. A total of 262 packages were shipped, with 100 packages of high-quality goods priced at 4 yuan and 162 packages of slightly inferior goods priced at 3.9 yuan. Yesterday, the new soybean market remained sluggish. Jiujiang beans fell by 0.05 to 0.06, Hankou fell by 0.1. Aside from merchants in this district buying 3 or 4 cars of old grain beans, car workshops in Jiangbei acquired 6 or 7 cars, and the price fell by another 0.07 or 0.08. The market situation was due to the stock of beans in local warehouses of approximately 400 cars, and sources arriving one after another. Currently, factories are not moving on purchasing, and local sales are limited. Other groups are only making limited purchases, and new beans from various places will be available one after another in ten days. Therefore, relying on sales in this district is unlikely to last for long, so there is concern that the prospects for old grain beans will suffer a total collapse.</p>

However, it has developed well. Now it is opening leaves after two sleep phases. Now that we are happily receiving rain, the mulberry trees are moisturized and leaves are flourishing. Therefore, the farmers have to added late silkworms, so the amount of breeding is smoother, the climate is suitable, and the hatching of the species is smooth. The seedling is coming at the same time, each large company is opening leaves, the instructors are breeding the young silkworms with new mulberry.</p>

<p>As he said this, he kept nodding. Cheng Zhiqian said, "I've eaten. People in Xi'an all eat two meals. They eat this afternoon meal at four o'clock. I ate at a friend's house." Zhang Jiefu interjected, "Things in Xi'an are really expensive, beer sells for one yuan and seventy or eighty cents a bottle." Cheng Zhiqian said, "Things from the East are always expensive here. People coming here should be prepared to endure hardship, these things from the East, it's better not to use them." Zhang Jiefu got the opportunity to talk to that person, and didn't seize the opportunity, but first asked for advice for a while. Then he interjected, "I just heard that Mr. Cheng is going to visit Zhouling. This is really a place we should visit first when we come to the Northwest. Is there a car to get there?" Cheng Zhiqian said, "I haven't inquired about that. I've decided to go." Li Shilian said, "Aren't you going by car?" Cheng Zhiqian said, "A friend who just came promised to lend me his car." Li Shilian said, "Mr. Cheng is very elegant, and must have a great interest in archeology. The culture of the Northwest has great value in history, and it is necessary to investigate it. We admire Mr. Cheng very much for coming here with the purpose of enduring hardship." Zhang Jiefu said, "Mr. Cheng, please come and sit in our room, okay? It's rare to meet in this place." Cheng Zhiqian felt that the two were very polite, so he had to follow Zhang Jiefu into his room. Zhang Jiefu invited him to sit down and immediately took out the biscuits in the basket to offer him. Li Shilian remembered that he had brought canned goods, and there was still a can of candied pears that he hadn't eaten, so he also asked the room attendant to open it and send it to Cheng Zhiqian to eat. After talking for a long time, Cheng Zhiqian proposed to visit Zhouling tomorrow. If the two of you are willing to go, you can go together. Li Shilian said, "We are very willing to go. But Director Wu is accompanying Mr. Cheng, so it might be a little inconvenient for us to go together, right?" Cheng Zhiqian laughed, "That's okay, I'll introduce you two in a moment." As soon as Zhang and Li heard this, they stood up at the same time and bowed to Cheng Zhiqian several times, repeatedly saying thank you, thank you. (12)</p>

<p>— By Li Kui</p>
<p>People who have lived in Beiping, no one does not know the story of this white tea. This story, like that old host in Shaguoju who once served the Empress Dowager Cixi, is being passed down by the general public.</p>
<p>It is said that white tea is extremely precious, and can be said to be the head of tea. In the Qing Dynasty, only the royal family could afford to eat it, let alone the poor, they did not even have the eye-blessing of seeing white tea.</p>
<p>But now the remnants of the old dynasty living in Beiping (they wear old-fashioned gowns and robes, and walk swaying, as if going to see their masters. They are still dreaming of the past!) they have already become so poor that some sell their daughters to brothels to become prostitutes, and some live from meal to meal.</p>
<p>But they are still eating white tea｜this is called poor style. Because they used to eat white tea; now if they don't eat white tea, wouldn't it seem decadent! He is still unwilling to show his decadence. Although they have already fallen to the point where they can no longer fall.</p>
<p>They are so embarrassed that eating has become a problem, where do they have money to buy white tea to eat? To be honest, they can't afford to buy white tea, even better tea they can't afford! And they can't afford to eat it!</p>
<p>When guests come, because they don't have tea, they take out some of the old tea they have drunk before, pick out some leaves that are neat, and put them in the teacup; this not only has no taste at all, but also has no color at all!</p>
<p>But if the guests ask curiously, they will say very politely: "This is the best white tea!"</p>
<p>Although the guests do not believe their nonsense; but it is not good to say anything; they can only nod in agreement. Who would be willing to expose their pitiful secret!</p>

<p>On the track of life, I don't know how many happy things there are; I also don't know how many sad things there are. Sadness and happiness are the sunny and rainy days of the mind; they are two cyclically playing notes on the strings of life.</p>

<p>Avenue Joffre in the French Concession is mysterious. Nanjing Road in the British Concession is noisy. But Yuyuan Road is not comparable to the mysterious Avenue Joffre, nor the noisy Nanjing Road. Tall buildings on both sides face each other, and the road in the middle stretches horizontally. Trolleybuses and buses come and go non-stop, private cars and taxis, pass in an instant, come over in an instant. There are not as many people as on Nanjing Road and Avenue Joffre, it is a quiet road.</p>
<p>Paramount Dance Hall stands proudly at the intersection of Yuyuan Road. Once the lights are on, the bright electric lights illuminate it like daytime. Young masters, modern ladies, business tycoons, and political bosses are intoxicated in it, laughing and dancing, but the intoxicating music cannot be heard outside, how quiet it is!</p>
<p>On Yuyuan Road, there are banks, bookstores, and various shops. There are also various different lanes, neighborhoods, and villages, which are very modern, with bathrooms, garages, water heaters, air conditioning, everything. In addition, the elegant private gardens with flowers, trees, and plants add a lot of color.</p>
<p>Huierkang Restaurant, Saint Anna Dance Hall, and all kinds of consumption and food halls are all together. The quiet and vast Zhaofeng Park is also at the end of Yuyuan Road, which is why the word "quiet" is added to Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>Gold! On Yuyuan Road, in the city, in the world, everything can be bought, mysterious, noisy, and quiet roads are all colored by gold. Alas! Gold! Almighty gold!</p>

<p>— Originally by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Here, we can imagine even more that the reason why their descendants do not come to sweep the tombs must be that their economic situation is really so distressed that they cannot bear it; and the distress that the dead feel underground is even more unbearable to imagine!</p>
<p>Those barren graves that she was pointing to are actually charitable cemeteries; charitable cemeteries are run by local charitable organizations, and not a good deed that individuals can undertake, which is where the old lady misunderstood.</p>
<p>Speaking of tomb sweeping, although everyone's original intention is the same; but its form, due to the different economic abilities of each person, must be divided into the following types: The first type is wealthy families. They must first prepare a very rich feast of wine and dishes, and have servants carry it, respectfully and reverently, to display it in front of their ancestral tombs; while burning paper ingots, they kowtow and salute. After displaying it for several tens of minutes, they take all the wine and dishes back, and send it all into their own stomachs. The second type is middle-class families. Although they are not so powerless as to prepare wine and dishes, their ancestors did not explicitly demand them, so they decided to simplify things; but paper ingots are always brought to be burned, because it has been a tradition since ancient times, although no one has ever presented any evidence, everyone deeply believes that after the paper ingots are burned, the dead can get real silver; fortunately, the living do not need paper ingots, as long as they spend a little money, they can buy a lot of paper ingots. If they really want them to burn the banknotes, money notes, and foreign money that the living need to use themselves to the dead, they would rather die than do it! The third type is families below the middle class, the economic situation of these families, probably described by the four words "robbing Peter to pay Paul" is certainly very accurate. (121)</p>

<p>Opening rivers to prevent drought, there are clear instructions in ancient times. In the twelfth year of Tongzhi in our Anhui, Mr. Zhang Mingzhai opened the Xincheng Changhe River, which had water until the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, which shows the importance of opening rivers. Now the rivers are polluted and no one cares, if we don't take advantage of this drought year to open the rivers, are we going to ask the sixty-third generation Zhang Tianshi for rain forever? Some people say that the water and funds taken from the people in peacetime can always be used for the people now, right?</p>
<p>Friends who are shouting to go to the countryside, please practice what you say, go to the countryside to see the tragic situation of the countryside, it is better to act than to sit and talk, the personal visit of a certain county magistrate to the countryside, the farmers' automatic opening of ditches and digging ditches can be taken as an example, seeking heaven is not as good as digging the ground, this is the time.</p>

<p>— (Yang Yusheng)</p>
<p>In Europe and America, it is said that "heat" runs faster than "cold," so everywhere in the folk is "hot air." At the same time, they are very disgusted with "cold," so the term "Catch Cold" is prevalent. In the minds of Europeans and Americans, "cold" is considered to "injure" the "customs" of the people!</p>
<p>Chinese folk is not like this, it seems that there is a "malaria ghost" at work. This malaria ghost probably died of old age in the summer, fearing heat and liking cold, so "heat" spreads very slowly, and cannot last long, it subsides in a flash of five minutes. But [cold] progresses very quickly. And can last for one or two years or even decades! Therefore, the Chinese folk is a piece of cold!</p>
<p>Visiting friends, Jian Wang Yujun, no news since January 28, where are you currently living? Please send a letter to the original address as expected. (Ju Ping)</p>

<h3 id="e264">Talking About Travelogues <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shicheng</p>
<p>"To believe everything in books is worse than having no books." Opening my mouth to recite Mencius, I am not using Master Mencius to put on a show to scare people... In this day and age, Master Mencius's show no longer works. China is modernized; the psychology of modern people... whether it's people or academics, they've all been married off｜other people's wives are better｜. To scare people, it might be more effective to borrow foreign shows like Bernard Shaw and Gorky... I recite Mencius to... practice the eight-legged essay style of playing tricks, saying "To believe everything in travelogues is worse than having no travelogues." The common problem with travelogues is inaccuracy; because of their inaccuracy, they cannot be fully believed.</p>
<p>The authors who write travelogues do not intentionally want to be inaccurate. The reasons for their inaccuracy are roughly the following five: (1) deliberately seeking perfection, (2) abusing rhetoric, (3) differences in knowledge and environment, (4) differences in physical strength, (5) weakness in observation.</p>
<p>A desire to win is a common human psychology; when writing, if you can't come up with a unique way to win, you can't overwhelm the crowd. So the six words "unwilling to speak ordinary words" is a compliment in Chinese literature. Although travelogues should be a kind of factual writing; they can't avoid being influenced by this psychology.</p>
<p>Rhetoric is an indispensable and important condition in writing; describing scenery especially relies on its great power. Rhetoric in classical Chinese often becomes a kind of "idiom." In order to avoid the ridicule of "fabrication," they strive to apply "idioms"; so even stone walls that are dozens of feet high, and deep pools of several fathoms, are all described with the idioms "walls standing a thousand fathoms high" and "bottomless abyss of ten thousand fathoms." Eight feet is a fathom, a thousand fathoms is eight thousand feet, ten feet is a zhang, ten thousand zhang is one hundred thousand feet. Who has ever seen a stone wall eight thousand feet high, or a pool one hundred thousand feet deep? In fact, we can't say, and dare not say that there are no such high or deep walls and pools; but it won't always be that the stone wall is exactly eight thousand feet high, and the pool is exactly one hundred thousand feet deep, without any difference. Abusing rhetoric and idioms is the second reason for the inaccuracy of travelogues.</p>
<p>People's ideas change with environment and knowledge. People who grow up in cities, as long as they leave the noisy cities and go to the countryside; even if there is no beautiful scenery, they feel that it is quiet and pleasant, picturesque everywhere, making people feel refreshed and happy. Those who are used to living in the countryside will not have the above feelings. Also, people who have never seen mountains in their lives, once they have the opportunity to see the North and South Peaks by the West Lake in Hangzhou or the Tianping and Tianchi Mountains in Suzhou, will naturally feel their greatness and loftiness. If you change to someone who has climbed Tianmu and Xuetou, they will not have that feeling of loftiness and greatness. If you change to someone who has worshipped the Five Sacred Mountains and traveled to Mount Emei and Snow Mountain, not only the North and South Peaks and Tianping and Tianchi are just small hills; even the Xuetou Mountains are not considered very high. Since people's environment and knowledge are different, even if they are traveling to the same place, their feelings are also different. Then the travelogues they write will naturally not be consistent.</p>
<p>Physical strength is also different, like environment and knowledge. For those who are strong walkers, running a hundred or eighty miles is nothing! Those who can't run find it difficult to walk three or five miles. Those who are good at climbing mountains don't find it difficult to climb very high peaks; those who are not good at climbing mountains feel breathless and leg sore after walking a few steps on a mountain road! Affected by physical weakness, they can't help but make the near seem far, and the low seem high. I have seen a travelogue about Ge Ling in Hangzhou... the author started from Hangzhou and walked to the foot of Ge Ling, saying that his feet were already tired; when climbing the mountain, he was like the end of a crossbow, and it was difficult to walk. He also described Ge Ling as unreachably high. People who have never been to Hangzhou, after reading this record, will definitely wonder how far Ge Ling is from Hangzhou, and how high the mountain is? However, those who have traveled to Ge Ling can't help but smile silently. This is clear evidence that physical weakness causes the travelogue to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>When we travel, the mountains, rivers, plants, and trees we see, of course, need to be described when writing the record. How high is the mountain? How wide is the river? We can't measure them one by one with a ruler; we can only judge by our own observation. Although we can't be very accurate, we can't just say whatever we want; if our common sense is insufficient and our observation is weak; then the result of speculation will be too far from the truth; wouldn't that become a joke?</p>

<h3 id="e265">A Message to Friends Who Are "Slow at Heart" <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>When discussing any kind of academic subject, or any kind of problem, whether the object of discussion is worth discussing or not, there must first be two attitudes: (1) an attitude of research, and (2) an attitude of humility.</p>
<p>Because of the former, "The wise man sometimes makes a mistake in a thousand thoughts, and the fool sometimes gains something in a thousand thoughts," therefore the more academic subjects are researched, the more refined they become, and the more thoroughly the problems are discussed. With the latter, "Fullness invites loss, and humility benefits," although these two words are also old sayings, they are still useful in the place of being a person or doing research. Assuming that an academic subject or a problem only has my own opinions, and absolutely does not allow the opinions of others, this narrow-minded view is still used by previous scholars to form parties and attack dissidents to obliterate everything, which is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>After this magazine published Mr. He's article criticizing the Literature One-Year Anniversary Special Issue "Me and Literature" last month, in the Literature Forum of Literature Volume 3, No. 3, there was Mr. Hua's article "A Message to Friends Who Are Impatient at Heart," which naturally launched a big attack on Mr. He's article. Which of these two articles is right and which is wrong, I don't have much energy and time to criticize, but Mr. Hua has a few words in the article "A Message to Friends Who Are Impatient at Heart," and these few words are not directed at Mr. He, I have to bring them up to explain.</p>
<p>"For example, a few days ago someone raised the issue of mass language, didn't a friend who was impatient at heart come out in the talk of the Shen Bao at the same time, and immediately asked them to make a few mass language works to see?"</p>
<p>Is this sentence wrong again? Where is it wrong? It is impatient, it is to ask the writers who advocate mass language to first make a few standard mass language texts to see, indeed, I am wrong, I am too impatient, they advocate mass language; it is originally shouting slogans, praising each other, there is no need to look at the works, so the facts cannot be asked, and are not allowed to be asked, especially to ask them to make mass language standard texts and publish them to the public, it is really presumptuous, empty checks can be issued indiscriminately, but they are never allowed to be cashed, it is really a strange thing.</p>
<p>Mr. may be a writer, I will use magazines as an example to listen to Mr., for example, Mr. creates a magazine and publishes it in a bookstore, but the book buyer must first look at the contents of the book, the nature of the book, before buying it, I have never heard of it, the bookstore only has books to buy, but no books to read, to take a step back, my book has not yet been successful, first sell pre-sale coupons, it has a three-point slippery nature, but what is the content of this book, when will it be published, always report to people to listen to, so that everyone can go to buy, if only the name of the book, and the content is not allowed to be announced, the publication is also indefinite, it will make the general readers believe and buy, I think this method, only playing poker cards can only have a pair of small twos in hand, can make people a pair of "open" or "kan hu", throw more in the pile of cards, this is called sneaking, there is probably no such thing in the literary world.</p>
<p>Because my brain, is not as sensitive and authentic as Mr. Hua's, so I don't understand what kind of writing mass language is, so I want to ask the writers who advocate mass language to make a few standard mass language texts, so that the general stupid people - like my generation - can imitate, I know it is a big hit, offended Mr.'s taboo, not only refused to teach, but was ashamed and angry, mixed up, said that I am also a "impatient" friend, here I can't help but have some doubts, what kind of medicine are the gentlemen advocating mass language selling in the gourd ladle? I can't help but be "impatient."</p>
<p>Now take the vernacular movement in the May Fourth period as an example, the writers who advocated vernacular at that time, they themselves started to write vernacular to promote it. Regardless of whether their vernacular is a product of capitalism, they did not just talk vernacular, after all, they took out some things, what kind of things are the now advocating mass language taking out for us to see? The vernacular movement has been almost twenty years, may I ask whether the vernacular can be said to be completely successful, has the classical Chinese completely died? I dare not say this sentence; because the public documents are still full of classical Chinese, and most of the newspapers are classical Chinese, how can it be said that the vernacular is completely successful? Is the classical Chinese completely dead?</p>
<p>Since the vernacular is not completely successful yet, and then we promote mass language, this kind of "impatience" is probably fifty steps laughing at a hundred steps with my generation? I have no preparation for mass language, no plan, just shouting slogans, praising each other, is also "impatience", now that mass language has not come out, first do not allow people to speak, do not allow people to discuss, this kind of "impatience method" is probably more powerful than us, so I advise Mr., and slowly laugh at us "impatience", let's go ask others again, who is "impatient".</p>
<p>It's not just Mr. who laughs at my impatience, probably the gentlemen who advocate mass language, or want to laugh at my "impatience". They have several ways of laughing... One way of laughing is to say that when Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated revolution, he never took out things to see first, and another way of laughing is to say that ideal is the mother of fact. The first statement is completely nonsense, there is absolutely no reason, because political revolution, or racial revolution, can use extraordinary means to exercise, and literature</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>academic revolution, can never be done by extraordinary means. The second statement, although more reasonable, is actually somewhat inaccurate; recent people only see the foreigners' planes, cannons, wireless electricity, death rays, etc., are very powerful; but they have also gone through many scientists in the laboratory for a long time of research and experimentation, and then succeeded, not like Cao Cao asking Zuo Ci to eat, wanting to eat dragon liver, dragon liver arrives, wanting to eat four-gilled bass, four-gilled bass arrives, wanting to create mass language, I'm afraid it can't be as easy as Mr. Zuo Ci?</p>
<p>The writers who advocate mass language, naturally have a patriotic and people-loving psychology, not necessarily just put forward the three words mass language to deceive the public, deceive the illiterate. But we must also first conduct a thorough study of how the mass language is generated, and how to promote it to the public after it is generated, but since the three words mass language have been around, I have not seen a text designed for the mass language in a practical and dynamic way, but only wrote vernacular that was produced with capitalism and shouted the slogan of mass language.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that one gentleman wrote a few sentences of Pudong dialect and claimed it as Pudong mass language, and another gentleman wrote a few sentences of Shanghai dialect and happily claimed to be Shanghai mass language, these works came out, it is really a great bad luck in the literary world, I initially thought that it was deliberately done to oppose mass language, but later I found out that it was a loyal comrade of mass language, it is really the biggest joke in the world.</p>
<p>Some say that the three words mass language were produced because some people in the literary world, who want to climb up the ladder, worry that classical Chinese may be revived, so they simply create a mass language to resist, which is no different from a person who has a serious illness, the family does not go to a good doctor to diagnose and treat, but goes to a Taoist priest and witch to catch demons and subdue demons, the same stupidity. And a general group of shrimp soldiers and crab generals, then wheat straws are used as tokens of authority, they wave flags and shout, flying all over the stage, and those who wear silk scarves and feather fans, then sit high on the city head, raise their beards and nod and laugh, unfortunately I am not the kind who want to climb up the ladder, otherwise I would also promote a small mass language, so that a general group of shrimp soldiers and crab generals can also stir up a commotion and shout.</p>
<p>To unify thought and unify speech, only methods used by political power or political means can be used, the literary world is afraid of not having such power, such authority, now there are many people who doubt mass language, or oppose mass language, but people like Mr. Hua, do not use theory to convince, or use facts to explain, but use a mocking attitude to want to control everything, it is really boring, very pitiful; I advise Mr., do not wear a high hat, put on a red robe, mixed in the shrimp soldiers and crab generals team, shout and shout!</p>
<p>Mr. should be a specialist in literature, should have some of the writers of the attitude of research, humbly accommodate all aspects of opinions, is the right, do not put on the posture of the era of progressive, mass language expert's face, casually ridicule others, or indiscriminately scold others. Known as the literary world, not like the City God Temple in Shanghai, the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, is a place dedicated to the sale of fists or the sale of hundred herbs pear paste sugar to deceive the audience.</p>
<p>What I advise you is very opposed to mass language, but it is not, because I said these words, but can arouse the reflection of the general advocate mass language gentlemen, desperately the mass language to study well, organize, if there is a mass language published and implemented one day, then my credit, not under the general shrimp soldiers and crab generals, if the mass language and even stillborn, can not produce, then the literary world should also clean up some of the air, do not get so smoky, I warn Mr. Hua, but laugh at me "impatient"! ｜End｜</p>

<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>The people of Verdun covered their ears and closed their eyes; their pounding hearts were caught in the panicked air.</p>
<p>|| War is a python!</p>
<p>They knew war was coming soon!</p>
<p>(The bugles of the army sounded, da, da, da! Black, gray, terror, and decline permeated the heavens, this ball-like sky! Already overflowing with the taste of blood!</p>
<p>The Lesde family’s home is far from the Maas River!</p>
<p>Maas River! It is the flow of our lives.</p>
<p>Yes, the people of the French Maas Riverbank all praise this blue and lively Maas River!</p>
<p>Young Lesde, his life is active, his nature is gentle, his skin is beautiful!</p>
<p>The army set off! He was inside too.</p>
<p>War broke out! He was inside too.</p>
<p>He left his hometown, parents, and beloved friend Molly; unexpectedly, he carried a rifle and a bundle on his body, and, and several rows of lethal bullets! He went far away! Stationed on the blue and lively banks of the Maas River.</p>
<p>His hometown is Durosey! Durosey! Durosey, where beautiful gales often rise! French Durosey!</p>
<p>He said...</p>
<p>|| War is terrible!</p>
<p>However, his words were a grain of sand in the desert!</p>
<p>So, he wandered silently! Vanished! Tearfully, heartbreakingly. Although, during the long European war, he was lucky not to die.</p>
<p>He returned to his hometown! Molly married the young pastor from the former church.</p>
<p>His father was captured by the enemy and has not returned.</p>
<p>His mother remarried someone else and does not recognize her own son!</p>
<p>One day.</p>
<p>He sat dejectedly in a cafe. He ran into Molly, who had once said to him, "Go forth! When you return, we will be even happier!" Next to her was a young man! That was the pastor!</p>
<p>Molly didn't recognize him!</p>
<p>Such a tattered person, full of beard! And scars, and wrinkles...</p>
<p>However, the outline of his face was still Lesde from five years ago!</p>
<p>|| Why are you so disgusting! Lesde wouldn't be like this.</p>
<p>He knew Molly was still thinking of him! || His heart ached. This was Molly's voice, absolutely true! Soon, he heard her say to that man...</p>
<p>|| If there is any news of Lesde, I will go find him! He is my dearest! You are... you really are...</p>
<p>| Stop!</p>
<p>Her words were soft!</p>
<p>Lesde felt very lucky! Because no one recognized him!</p>
<p>Molly and the others left! As they passed Lesde's seat, he stopped and stared!</p>
<p>|| Madam, what are you looking for?</p>
<p>He said this meaninglessly.</p>
<p>|| Are you Lesde?</p>
<p>She asked timidly.</p>
<p>|| Madam! I... I am not! You must be mistaken!</p>
<p>Her face flushed.</p>
<p>|| Molly! You ambitious woman! You still want to find that kind of fool? You, go find him in God's place!</p>
<p>Said the young man with the small mustache.</p>
<p>He knew he was the pastor! He had seen him come to the army to celebrate Mass!</p>
<p>They left.</p>
<p>He also went out with his head down.</p>
<p>People were noisy. Crowded. Gradually, it became deserted again! Ahead, all was desolate!</p>
<p>Lesde walked towards the wilderness without stopping.</p>
<p>Tears are turbid, his face is black, his wrinkles are deep, his beard is thick...</p>
<p>|| War is a sharp arrow piercing people's hearts!</p>
<p>They knew war was coming soon again!</p>
<p>The people of Verdun will hear this story from Durosey again!</p>

<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>On a sunny morning, I wander under the trees in the park, birds chirping above my head, already companions for three months; that unknown girl, haven't we met for ninety days?</p>
<p>From summer to autumn, we meet every day on the yellow sand path. We lower our heads to each other, or are we counting our own steps? It's so slight, like a lover's whisper.</p>
<p>My heart is melancholy.</p>
<p>The white geese by the pond, regardless of the flying yellow sand, chase each other. Sometimes they pounce on my heels, thinking someone is chasing me. Secretly peering around... An iron cage locking up a pair of deer... A few withered leaves flutter on the iron sand chair; the surface of the pond is disturbed like an restless heart; ninety days, this is a long-lasting memory | and ahead, a melancholy heart counting its own steps.</p>
<p>It's like a ripe dreamscape, that dreamscape lingers in my heart | Ah, one day, one day, that sunny morning will illuminate the illusion of this dreamscape.</p>
<p>Wait, count your own steps!</p>
<p>Three months, a long distance! The tail of the autumn wind will tear the last page of this set of calendars, will you ever see the joyous spring again, this ripe dreamscape?</p>
<p>Having walked to the end of the yellow sand path, look at the heaven and earth at that end! Pervaded by the great fog of London, where is the edge of your dreamscape?</p>
<p>My own steps disappear deep into the depths of a melancholy heart!</p>
<p>On a sunny morning, dragging my own slender shadow, from day ninety-one onwards.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Widow <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Nan</p>
<p>Her precious youth was burned by the flames of famine, poverty, and unrequited love, losing her beautiful charm. She has no children, so she lives a lonely life without a husband. The crowd in this world is terribly indifferent, like snakes and scorpions, who would dare to approach them? In fact, they are more terrifying than tigers. They devour your youth, and when they are disgusted, they will throw you into the farthest reaches of the sky; countless women have suffered this kind of torture. She has never been abandoned by her husband, and has never been divorced like the "modern" people of today; he was loyal and conscientious, yet he did not live to old age with her, and suddenly left her alone in this desert-like human world to suffer!</p>
<p>She is my neighbor, only separated by a staircase, living her lonely and miserable life in the attic, the sadness of not having a husband, the loneliness of not having a son, she is suffering in this human world in a different way, living someone else's life. A sorrowful face, attacked by famine, relying only on her own hands to work for others, the money she earns is hardly enough to maintain her own life. That weak and pitiful woman, in this male-centered society, in the old living environment, how can a frail woman who is barely alive escape this danger of starvation in this treacherous crowd? Even if you can work, the sadness of the times is full of the misery of unemployment!</p>
<p>In this dirty world | especially in this evil and terrifying money-obsessed Shanghai, you pure and bright widow, you must be careful of the traps of mankind, in this vile, base, deceitful, and treacherous society, mankind will not have holy sympathy for you!</p>

<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The other day, a reporter from a certain news agency inquired with the International Trade Bureau and learned that the import value of shark fins, used by the upper and middle classes to entertain guests, was 8,980,072 gold units in the first seven months of this year, equivalent to 1,791,653 national currency units, which is a significant increase compared to the same period last year, and most of it is consumed in this port.</p>
<p>I truly envy the unshallow good fortune of the wealthy classes, but if the blood in your body is not completely cold, then look at the situation in the Northeast, the tense state in North China, and the overseas Chinese being driven back batch after batch by foreigners, how can they still eat such precious things?</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, August 30th. Minister of Education Matsuda has decided to ban the use of the terms "daddy" and "mommy" in elementary schools and kindergartens, stating that it damages Japanese customs.</p>
<p>Truly, Japan has now leaped to become an arrogant and domineering powerful nation, coming to learn the half-colonial Chinese children's terms "daddy" and "mommy." Only we Chinese, because of the poor national fortune, learn from foreigners in various ways, even the culture inherent in our country for thousands of years! Such as writing! Also unlucky and don't want it all together, what will such people think when they see it?</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, August 30th. The government today ordered that all unmarried men and women under the age of twenty-five who hold public or private positions should be dismissed and replaced by older people, especially those with families.</p>
<p>Germany's advocacy of reproduction has been repeatedly emphasized; it is meticulous. This order naturally also advocates reproduction, but turning around to ask, what is the intention of advocating reproduction? This is very simple, nothing more than breeding them to sacrifice and become cannon fodder. Since our country's population is already so large, there is naturally no need to advocate reproduction again. We should advocate birth control, lest they become slaves, lest they be trampled by foreigners, lest they be given the cold shoulder by foreigners, lest they starve to death in batches.</p>
<p>Reuters London dispatch, August 30th. Chen Shangda, a Chinese military academy student, left his country in 1929 at the age of nineteen to visit his father's grave in Peru. Because he carried little funds, he often walked the journey, passing through Japan, North America, and South America, and arriving at his father's grave, having worn out fifty pairs of shoes and walked 15,000 miles.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, non-filial piety has been practiced. Children treat their parents with the same attitude as they treat passersby, and they are still considered filial sons. Therefore, when parents are still alive, it is still like this. As for when the grave is already arched with trees, visiting is even more so. Only a few important people, returning home in glory, without a reason, just borrow the beautiful name of sweeping the grave to let people hear it. Chen Shangda is really a fool.</p>

<p>Regarding this point, she scolded me even more, scolding me for being a little goose and telling me that soon I would understand my absurdity; after saying these threatening words, she left me. I was busy preparing for the dance, and I was so busy until the evening that everything was ready. According to the officer's suggestion, I tied a wide red, white, and green ribbon around my waist, and on my head, I only tied a rose flower of red and white, paired with green leaves, and it became a national beauty. I had never discovered how good these colors mixed together were before.</p>
<p>The two officers waited with great joy, saying so many polite things to us, I couldn't imagine how they learned them. I had to cover up my embarrassment with a smile.</p>
<p>"Oh, you see, this matter will end in tears," my mother said, but she continued to tidy up my clothes, changing this one, changing that one, as if if they took me away, at least it would make them feel that everything was in order.</p>
<p>The two officers accompanied us to the ballroom. I had already happily thought about the impact that my national-colored ribbon and our two handsome young men would have on the gathering, and as we walked in, I was still thinking that if everyone in the room had square heads, we could have the only two round-headed people.</p>
<p>But my error and surprise were extreme. Almost every one of my female companions had at least two national-colored ribbons like me, and as for the officers, our two warriors could only be considered third-rate figures among them. Each one was more cordial, charming, beautiful, and lively - how could such people shed so much blood!</p>
<p>One of them especially caught my attention, not just me, everyone did. He was a young captain! His movingly beautiful face and tall, elegant posture were extremely suitable for the trimmed military uniform, which seemed to be molded on his body. Next, there was his dancing! How energetically he danced the mazurka and the czardas! Someone would rush through the crowd and embrace him! This is not me saying myself. Moreover, more endearing than his dancing and his solicitousness was the purity in his dazed black eyes. In less than an hour, every daughter in this room had fallen in love with him. I am not excluding myself. If they are so reckless on the battlefield, I don't know what anyone can resist them. But suddenly he stepped in front of me and asked me to dance the next quadrille with him, imagine my emotions at this time!</p>
