<h3>汪精衛致開會詞</h3>
<p>（南京）中央常委汪兆銘兆、二十日在第四次中央全體會議席上致開會詞原文如下、各位同志、從二十一年十二月三中全會閉會之後、以至今日、整整一年了、這一年中、國難繼續二十年九月十八日以來的趨勢而日益嚴重、去年三月以來、我國軍隊在長城一帶拚命苦鬥、經過了三個月的血戰、而共匪忽於此時圖襲南昌、至五月而有華北停戰恊定之成立、自是以後、併力於淸除共匪、至十月十一月間、江西方面纔得有顯著之進步、而陳銘樞李濟深等又忽於此時發難於福州、統計這一年中、對外對内、艱難危險之狀不可殫述、可以說是本黨執政以來最因苦的時期、亦是中國有史以來最危急的時期、國難的發生、原因於最近數十年來中國政治經濟軍事文化等等之落後、這種落後的現狀本非一朝一夕之力所能挽回、而在此過程中、國難實有隨時發生的可能、本黨執政時期、遭遇此等困難、於一方面說、固然責無旁貸、在又一方面說、郤正因本黨致力於國民革命、求中國之自由平等之故、所以方興的勢力、如萌芽乍茁、卽横受風雨之摧殘、本黨爲中國自由平等的前途計、亦惟有盡力保持萌</p>

<h3>主席團今晨開會</h3>
<p>（南京）大會主席團定二十一日晨開會、討論議事日程、及各次會議輪流担任主席之名單、（廿日中央社電）</p>
<h3>林主席可望蟬聯</h3>
<p>（南京）國府林主席以任期兩年、業已屆滿、决向四中全會提出辭職、惟多數中委意見、仍主由林氏蟬聯、據某中委云、林主席年高德劭、受全體委員之推崇、但議塲上仍須經過選舉手續、（二十日）</p>
<h3>粤提案可望通過</h3>
<p>（南京）西南各中委提案幾度修改後、已由崔廣秀携帶來京、要點、一軍人不得干政、二、軍事期内軍隊須受政府指揮、三、集會結社言論出版自由、崔已將内容大要通知中常會秘書處、俟二十一日經各出席委員試行一度非正式計議、至關於將原案送達中央、以備從長計議、至關於中央與地方均權等一案、係胡氏個人提出、蓋卽外傳所謂西南第二提案是也、從會外形勢看來、西南提案可以由大會通過、交中常會辦理、至日後實行之程度與遲早、胥視事實而定、故該案在會塲决無多大辯論、而得全塲一致之同意中委吳敬恒語確有意味、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）孫科談、西南各委提出改革政制推進政治案、係根據胡展堂八項主張而起草、本人尙未得覩其全文、將來當可提出大會討論、胡先生謀國之心、同人甚爲欽佩、故胡主張之原則、預料中央當可接受、惟對推行辦法、尙待縝密研究、本人向大會並無提案、政府組織、全會不討論、亦無若何變更、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）吳稚暉談、西南各委向全會提出之總案、係以胡漢民八項主張爲中心、胡之八項主張、與中央方面之主張、頗爲洽合、如西南提案果係胡之八項主張、預料當能獲得多數中委之同情、余以爲所有提案、大會通過與否、無關重要、其根本問題、在於是否實行、如胡所談會而不議議而不行、中央曆屆大會所討論之决議案、均屬完善、而實行者殊寥寥無幾、（二十日專電）</p>
<h3>焦易堂亦有提案</h3>

<h3>平文化團體建議</h3>
<p>（北平）平文化團體聯合會、二十日電四中全會建議、設立中央文化委員會、實行三民主義之文化統制、並以政府力量、嚴格取締反動之文化宣傳、原電略謂、我國文化、近年以來、轉形退步、所謂普羅文學、乘時流行、鼓吹階級鬥爭、麻醉浮薄靑年、此誠爲民族國家根本危機、欲圖挽救、非以三民主義爲中心實施文化統制不可、茲擬請設立中央文化委員會、集中人材、從事編綦、譯述舉凡政治經濟社會科學哲學以至小說戲曲圖畫音樂均以三民主義爲範圍、對於反動出品、以政府力量嚴格取締、使人民心理有確切中心信仰、以樹立三民主義之文化基礎、黨國前途實有利賴云、（二十日中央社電）</p>

<h3>貨幣戰爭與中國經濟愼</h3>
<p>美國放棄金本位制度之後。在最近半年餘時間内。其國内生産消費。雖曾感受若干刺激。但至去年底又漸露衰落之象。同時當世各國。又皆極力推行其聯盟經濟。務使自國貨物盡量輸出增加。外來貨物輸入。務須求其减少。卽所謂經濟的自給自足也。美國東受大西洋彼岸歐洲諸國之抵制。西有日本在太平洋與彼競爭。而英日兩國。尤爲放棄金本最早之國家。其對外貿易市塲之開拓。已立相當之根柢。美國欲於短時間内取得如世界大戰後丨丨一九二六年前之經濟優勢。殊非易事也。</p>
<p>是以美總統羅斯福於買收現金政策不能見效以後。遂决然减輕美金所含純金成分至百分之四十。其用意所在。約如下述。第一·就美國現有金凖備額。丨丨三十六億六千萬美金丨丨實行通貨膨脹之結果。可以刺激國内産業界之興奮。換言之·卽提高國内物價是也。第二·在另一方面。通貨之純金成分。旣然减少。美金對外匯兌。必然减低於是美國在海外市塲上取得較爲廉價之優越地位。無論新舊市塲上。彼皆得有利於競爭之武器。第三·美國對外投資。除一百十二億美金對歐洲各國之戰債帶有政治性質不易收回者外。尙有一百七十五億之投資。屬於産業及借貸。而自一九二九年以來。亦皆次第凍結。難於如期收回。蓋以歐洲諸國多受經濟恐慌之困厄。南美方面亦感甚大之牽制也。若美金之成分减低。則收回債欵。或較容易。美國無形之輸入。始有增加希望。第四·美金成分减低以後。白銀比價自必增高於是對東方用銀國之輸出。可因此增加。遠東市塲。或可處於更有利之地位。</p>
<p>現在英晿几國。雖皆力示鎭靜。以爲美國此舉。於世界市塲無重大影響。彼皆能從容應付。惟事實上在美國放棄金本制之前。英日兩國卽有對抗之凖備。貨幣戰爭之形勢。早已同於關稅戰爭矣。不過關稅爲加高稅率。貨幣則减低幣值耳。</p>
<p>我國處列强環伺之下。無論爲英·爲美·爲日本·爲其他各國。莫不以我爲遠東市塲之對象。彼通貨膨脹政策實行。則傾消之力愈大。我以後進而又毫無切實凖備之國家。過去一年間入超且逾七萬萬元。則此後又將何抑制此如潮而來之外貨耶。</p>
<p>爲救急之計。首應須努力圖謀國際收支之平衡。在從前經濟恐慌尙未完全暴露之際。海外華僑。猶可以血汗之餘。挹注祖國。金銀之秘密輸出。亦足略資塡補。而過去列國對華投資。卽爲對我國經濟損失最大受禍最深之補償方式。而今而後。前兩種之華僑經濟漸見頽落。金銀蓄藏亦已枯竭。後一種之投資。亦以整個世界經濟恐慌之故。欲利用外資。以興辦實業。亦大非易事。吾人於此萬方多難之中。惟有勉强求自己顧金之道而已。㈠奬勵輕工業。提倡土貨。在我國今日之國際環境與國内事實。或可盡量發揮。不致受意外牽制。同時若政府方面。欲立卽實施輸出入貿易之統制。其勢似不可能。惟欲管理對外匯兌之凖備。制限外來非必需品之消塲。則尙不難見諸實施對於紡織工業及其他輕工業。政治上應給予特殊便利。然後可期其發達。進而爲輸出入貿易之統治。亦較順利。㈡輔導重工業之建設。我國目前大城市。不過具輕工業之雛形。中小城市則仍爲手工業狀態。欲以此與列國相競爭。絕無勝理。故重工業之振與。尤爲不可稍緩之企圖。惟重工業之建立。須有巨大資本。勢非合私人與政治之力。共同恊作不可也。</p>

<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院今日决定、不在公開會塲中討論薩爾問題、是以薩爾管理委員會主席諾克斯及出席國聯之各重要代表進行秘密會議、聞法外長彭古建議發表一宣言、聲明國聯將監視薩爾人民之得適當待遇、並保障其在一九三五年公民大會中有投票之完全自由、俾决定薩爾應否交還德國、或爲法國之一部份、或仍歸國聯管理之問題、彭古此項建議、頗爲人所贊同、明日將舉行公開會議討論此事、今日行政院通過小組委員會所提北伊拉克地方阿比西利亞基督敎徒應移居於南美巴西之報告書、並頒佈關於、專家委員會處理奴隸問題手續之條例、行政院本屆會期將於明日結束、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會行政院下午四時舉行非公開會議、有若干國代表要求薩爾問題今日不在公開會議提出、而於晚間由行政院舉行秘密會議討論之、英國卽如此主張、晚間行政院開會、審查薩爾問題、歷時兩點鐘之久、法國外長彭古以渠承認舉行秘密會議係附有條件者、卽行政院當於舉行公開會議時採取决定、並負担責任是也、此種公開會議大約明日舉行、此層彭古欲使薩爾區域人民及輿論明瞭之、各方以爲某某國家之輿論不當令其互相衝突、又以爲薩爾行政委員會主席克諾克斯之宣言如予以發表、殊足妨害該行政委員會之地位、開會時克諾克斯詳細說明薩爾之情形、說明之後、交換意見、彭古謂行政院對於担任籌備薩爾公民投票之委員會、究應指示方針、並應聲明薩爾人民、無論如何、决不致爲國聯會所棄置、彭古最後主張除由委員會提出報告書外、尙應由行政院、按照需要、發表宣言、此項主張、僅英外相西門略有異議、但卒决定卽時起草宣言、凖備明日提出、宣言如經全體承認、則在明年五月以前、此項問題卽視爲業已解决、國聯會秘書廳旋發表公報、内稱、國聯會行政院本日當薩爾行政委員會主席克諾克斯之前、並經渠之合作、對於、「薩爾區域舉行公民投樯之籌備事宜、交換意見、行政院定於今日下午四時舉行公開會議、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法總理演說</p>
<h3>德國表示失望</h3>
<p>謂將引起歐洲極度恐慌</p>
<p>（柏林）法總理旭丹在參議院所發表之國際外交演說、在德國輿論界顯然未能引起何等同情、據國家社會黨機關報伏吉錫爾博巴赫德所載、法總理之論調、勢將引起歐洲極度之恐慌、而歐洲之文化、勢將重見法國軍備政策之有新發展、故該報深望旭丹之論調、僅係對内而發者云、再則、德國普通報對於旭丹所稱德法聞直接談判之無效、因兩國問所談判之事項、同時亦與他國有深切之關係云云、頗表示不贊同、該報稱、此等解說、卽至愚者亦不知其不然、但倘法國政府堅持其强固不讓步之態度、並利用下級宣傳政策、破壞一切、則直接交涉當然難以有所成就云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>意大利允諾</p>
<h3>切實助奥獨立</h3>
<p>奥匈合併亦有可能</p>
<p>要求德國勿再干涉</p>
<p>◎維也納奥總理杜爾夫斯已獲意國援助之切實允諾、否則杜氏昨日决不公然宣言、奥國對於國家社會黨之活動、已忍無可忍、德國曾以炸彈原料之入奥境、意外部次官蘇維志刻在維也納、已與奥總理討論一切、今日有人以此問題詢之、蘇維志答稱、奥國和平最關重要、必先有和平而後始而可議及其他、蘇維志並言及墨索里尼對於奥國之計畫、說者謂意國將贊助奥匈之合併、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）據消息靈通者言、奥國駐柏林公使陶施茲、於星期三日進謁德國外交部長牛賴脫、談話之際、奥公使曾要求德國發表宣言、明白承認奥國獨立、並聲明不再干涉奥國内政、奥使並云、德國對於此事若不能予能滿意、則奥國將求直於國聯會云、按本月十八日奥總理陶爾斐斯曾發表演說、謂奥國忍無可忍、决計以全力恢復秩序云、由此可見奥國公使向德國外部提出要求之說不爲無因、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>◎匈牙利京城匈牙利財政部長印萊特尼最近自日内瓦返國、中途在維也納停留、據若干方面消息、印氏以觀察之資格判、又聞德國外交部商業司長伏爾苔克所領導之德國代表團、正與匈牙利政府進行商業談判、惟郷過情形嚴守秘密、並未發表何種公報、各報對於此事、取絕對保留態度、據經濟界探悉、匈德談判中對於匈國農産物之輸出價格、已發生困難云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英美匯兌協調</h3>
<p>美官塲方面未能徵實</p>
<p>羅斯福計畫可望通過國會</p>
<p>（倫敦）紐約商報載稱、英美兩國中央銀行間、業已商定以美元五元折合英幣一鎊、並互允運用匯兌調節基金、以維持此項比率云云、此間官塲人士頃予否認、謂美國方面爲適應某一時期利益起見、容或努力抑制美元之漲落、但並未與英國成立妥協、使此種抑制行爲具有永久性質云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）證劵交易所報係英倫金融界之言論機關、該報對於羅斯福總統說明其貨幣政策之咨文加以撰文解釋、謂此係美國回復正統貨幣政策之徵、「羅斯福總統係欲以貨幣貶價方法、趨近貨幣穩定之目的、羅氏擬與英國重行談判、俾得設立新匯兌調節基金、其意實爲主張協調政策而非欲利用此項談判、作爲鬭爭之具也」云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）政府通知國會大士、謂羅斯福總統貨幣政策内所定接收聯邦凖備銀行存金、設立匯兌調節基金種種辦法、不日卽將實行、故國會對總統所提出之貨幣計畫、應於下星期二日以前予以通過、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）國聯會行政院下年舉行公開會議、由波蘭外長柏克上校主席當將關於奥國·匃牙利·及保加利亞財政狀况之報告書、予以備案、旋卽討論衛生諮詢委員會工作、及伊拉克國亞西利安人民之安揷問題、巴西政府曾克許亞西利安人移殖該國、行政院特向巴西代表致謝、最後又請求菲洲之利比里亞國予以援助、行政院定於明日再舉行公開會議、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>沙阻新堤記（三）力行</h3>
<p>九天掙扎歷盡艱難</p>
<p>旣越流沙已抵宜昌</p>
<p>永年輪於十一日抵漢、停泊於飛機新碼頭、各團員卽相繼登陸、惟漢地氣候頗寒、途中只見黄包車上之乘客、咸埋首於大衣之皮領中耳、十一日晨、永年輪復離漢西駛、下午過新堤、詎以入冬水淺之故、河底盡是泥沙、如大膽行駛、必致擱淺、海關小輪、乃警告永年勿進、</p>
<p>永年當局對此、擬定計劃、第一步擬使人至新堤、雇船卸貨、使本輪之吃水减少、第二步計劃、如新堤無船可雇、卽在新新堤致電漢口民生公司、派輪前來卸貨、但結果新堤無船可雇、電報又非常遲緩、由是兩計劃均告失敗、永年於是復回漢口、永年當局於抵漢後、卽俟在滬踵永年之後西上之民貴輪到達漢地時、令各團員轉輪前進、以免躭擱、但十三日晚九時、民貴到漢、知民貴吃水、與永年不相上下、如民貴能安然駛過閻五關、永年亦可無慮、以是永年一方面卸貨、一方面隨民貴前進、冒險一綫、十四日晨、永年再度離漢西上、下午五六時、重過新堤、停泊於前次被阻之地點、民貴亦以天黑力盡、不能再冒險前進、兩輪乃各抛錨江中休息、期於十五日淸晨、一致越泥沙向宜昌進、十五日晨、永年民貴、果開足馬力、拚命向淤泥中蠕蠕進行、經四五小時之奮鬥、二輪均不能越過二百餘尺淺水距離之淤沙、只得仍回原地、另覓途徑、十六日、永年實行卸貨於民貴、以减低吃水、仍期越過流沙、乃十七日上午之試騐、永年復遭失敗、十八日决令民貴之貨、卸於永年、據云、民貴吃水較淺、或可渡此閻五路、但十九日民貴駛行時、是否能安然通過、</p>
<p>船中任何人、不敢與以保證、如是一抛錨便是九天、轉輾中流、一籌莫展、俗謂蜀道難行、豈料尙未抵蜀境、卽已艱苦難行、一至於是矣、</p>
<p>船中舉行團務會議、以决行止、議定如十九日晨民貴仍不能通過淤沙、仍請民生公司爲之設法、萬一如再無他法可想、則川康之考察、擬延期至春暖水漲時舉行、且目下打箭鑪及峨嵋山等地、冰雪塞途、朔風裂膚、西進行程、亦非易易、如待天時稍佳前往、於實地之考察、亦殊有益也、</p>
<p>揚子江水道之紓廻曲折、爲全國江流之冠、而新堤附近則爲折向南端之最、角度甚銳、且爲洪河流入長江之出口處、而今冬水勢之淺、又屬異乎尋常、故上游冲下之沙、至此匯聚不能流動、據老於長江航行之永年輪謝經理談、此種現象、爲其二十年來之創見、</p>
<p>國聞社云、本社昨接赴川記者航訊、知赴川滬記者團、因長江流沙、阻碍航程、致永貴民生兩輪、至十七日止、猶阻於新堤江面、嗣經向民生實業公司探訊、續悉該處江中最深之航槽、初有某輪擱住、致斷交通、現在該輪已經開走、故永年民貴兩輪、已均得通過、計程赴川記者團、已到宜昌換船上溯矣、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀書計劃（二）</h3>
<p>丨答何永泉君……（續）</p>
<p>從實踐出發去研究理論是最正確的。但這不是說自己一點識别力都沒有，不需苦讀幾本原論的書，只須看一兩册小册子或某雜誌一二篇短文卽可獲得。固然，我們沒有多的時間去讀大部頭的專著，但有時仍沒方法，不得不像你以前的那樣硬讀。你却不要以爲在幾部大書上用功是無聊，是學究的態度，是離開了實踐剛剛相反，只要你讀［理論］是爲了求了解實踐，不離開實踐，時時注意當前的事實，這就做到了理論與實踐的配合。我們却不能太偏於形式的機械化了。所以在你來信最後要我們供給你些研究材料當然可以照辦，至於理論部分，仍希望你自己去加深學習。</p>
<p>處理報紙上的材料亦甚不易。說來都可成爲一單獨的討論。近代的報紙是權力的代言人，權力意識統治的手段。你們閱一兩份報紙實在不够得很。可是，在你的經濟與時間的範圍内自然是無法的事。不過，要以客觀的態度去讀，不要過於信仰上面說的都是眞實。至於如何去讀報紙，我們擬出單行小册子，不在此地贅述。</p>
<p>關於你執行計劃的時間，我們還有點懷疑。就是你的希冀似乎過大，而時間又是那麽緊促，恐怕也非你的能力所能勝任罷！可否再將計劃縮小些，或者不從國際起，而從更切合你的生活環境某一部分開始如何。這不是說要你推翻整個計劃，是把你的計劃分段來實行。</p>
<p>再，關於［理論］大著的不易讀，我們早已關心，現在並在設法編印名著通俗本的計劃。不過，何時能出版問世，此刻尙不能說。</p>
<p>總之：你接到此信後，最好再經一番檢查，再改得實際些，要一定可以百分之百的實現。你的目標是很正確的。關於學力方向，最好請你凖備一下，約期親自到敝館來一談。此外，請何君以外的朋友們大家注意，歡迎新的意見參加。丨丨丨敬</p>

<p>（國聞社柏林二十日專電）中國美術展覽會已開幕、德國名人均到會、批評極好、轟動一時、我代表劉海粟濱說中國畫重神韻、爲各國畫所不及南高東大中大</p>
<h3>高考及格人員聯歡會</h3>
<p>南高東大中大應一二兩屆高考及格同學四十九人、於十八日在本京世界飯店舉行聯歡大會、中大校長羅家倫、畢業同學會代表王漱芳彭百川等、亦均參與、前校長朱家驊因公未到、來函致申歉意、席間由一屆考取總第一之周邦道致詞後、由羅校長及王漱芳君相繼致詞、大意不外引高考及格人數衆多、以爲母校榮譽、並希望及格人員以後工作、亦宣黽勉從公、保持過去的光榮、散席後、復相偕至中華照相館攝影、以留紀念、</p>
<h3>中國大學敎育之危機（三）</h3>
<p>至於文法等院畢業生的出路、則大部要靠政府容納、政府爲拔取眞材、澄淸吏洽、安全社會起見、應該嚴格實行公務員考試制度現在兩年一次的高等二試還是不夥的、應該年年舉行、給優秀大學畢業生以充分的服務機會、現在各機關用人大都要介紹信實在是不好的現象弄到兄弟這樣不足重輕的人、一年不知道要寫多少封介紹信出去、明知無用、然而要信的人還是非要你寫不可、這是因爲政府登庸進陟、並無確定的方法、於是謀事的人奉一紙八行書爲至實、那找不到旁人的於是找到我、眞是慘極了、西洋各國則公務員的任用、大都有確定的制度、其中以英法兩國的爲最好、美國從前的仕途也是狠亂的、十九世紀美國位大總統傑克遜（Ｊａｃｋｓｏｎ）便公認當時官吏任用制度爲分贓制度（ＳｐｏｉｌＳｙｓｔｅｍ）還爲這種制度辯護、說是很好、藉此可以使政權輪轉、免得偏枯、於是政黨交替之際、不問靑紅皂白、把異黨的舊人、一槪趕掉、政治成爲輪盤賭、影響自然壞極了以後社會上起了多年的運動、以前的大總統羅斯福尤爲努力、於是逐漸採用公務員考試制度、聽說現在美國聯邦的官吏約有六十萬人、其中有四十五萬是經過考試而後任用的、還有十五萬人、不免受政黨變更的牽涉、然在法國英國、則内閣更替、不過調換幾個部長、下面的事務人員絕沒有調動的危險、所以無論内閣改組多少次、政洽决無紛亂、說到中國、則［一朝天子一朝臣］沒有八行書、就換不到委任狀、眞得笑話、大家要認識確定公務員考試制度、是澄淸吏治的先决問題、第一屆高等考試錄取的人員、事實上百分之九十五已有實職、第二屆錄取人員也已分發、但是我總覺得一般人對於高考總還沒有達到應有的熱心、國人對於考試的信仰心、還未確立、有其他僥倖的路子可走的人、還是走僥倖的路子、不願意咿咿唔、從三考出身、這都是因爲怕考取了以後政府無法位置、分發到各機關裏去坐冷板櫈的緣故、然而在政府方面、也同樣感到困難、若是考取一百個人就要添一百個官、那不是高考錄取愈多、政府官吏愈多、老百姓担負愈重嗎、在確立大家對於考試的信仰心、要眞正澄淸吏治、我以爲每屆高考或普考的時候非抽調各機關現有的公務員來考試不可、每屆至少抽考各機關公務員總數百分之五或百分之十、並不妨害這機關公務的進行、取了則准你復職、並加一重保障、不取則以新取的人遞補、這樣一來、不但全國的人對於考試制度、確切信仰、並且現任公務員也有所警惕、常常研究、不至離開學問、無用的人員、不裁也就自裁了、像這般有系統的進行、自然在十年或二十年之内、能够把中國公務員任用制度樹立、且能爲靑年展開希望、爲社會保持公道、並間接的促進大學敎育的發達、關係誠非淺鮮、否則、專靠八行書任用官吏、吏治永遠不會淸明政治永不會上軌道、</p>
<p>最後、兄弟希望全國人民認淸、大學敎育如果辦學、應該取愛護扶植的態度、尤其絕對的不要利用靑年、大家要知道、利用未成熟的靑成、不啻斵喪國家民族的元氣、因爲靑年的光陰非常短促而且寶貴、我們不可使他浪費、千萬不要給他們不純潔的印象、而且要充分培養他們的人格給他們高尙的理想、使他們望見前途的光明、不要使他腦筋裏充滿了低等唯物觀念、抛開學問而從繳倖裏面求出路的心思、這便是斬斷了他們前途一線的生機、國家的元氣也因此受了無窮的損失、我們要知道中國此後所需要的、不是奔走開會、小智自私要發揮自己小領袖慾望的人、乃是沉着邁進有有專鬥智識和切實立法公忠無我、以爲國家社會服務的人、要有這樣的人、才能解决中國的問題、我們萬一自己不能看見中國的復興和强大、我們還得希望下一輩的人可以看見、（完）</p>

<p>四中全會開幕</p>
<h3>滬敎界發宣言</h3>
<p>▲國際情勢日趨矛盾遍地盡爲火藥庫</p>
<p>▲第二次世界大戰如箭在弦一觸卽發</p>
<p>▲中國之存亡關鍵繫於今日能否自救</p>
<p>▲全會應以討論應付非常時期爲中心</p>
<p>上海各大學校敎職員聯合會·各大學學生聯合會·各中等學校敎職員聯合會·各中學學生聯合會·爲四中全會值茲國難嚴重之時、開幕於南京、其關係於黨國前途者、至重且大、特聯合發表重要宣言、陳述其救國主張、茲探錄宣言原文如下、國家多故、於茲已極、内則赤匪跳盪、外則强寇侵凌、國本阽危、不可終日、中央爲統籌救國大計、以挽危亡、召開四中全會於首都、以中央諸委之高瞻遠矚、深信其必能舉網張目以圖之、惟吾人於此、謹代表全市各大學敎職員、各大學學生、各中華敎職員、各中學學生、猶有貢獻於我與會諸公者、今當一九三四年之歲首、</p>
<p>▲國際形勢　之錯綜矛盾、更甚於去年此時、其去所謂非常危機之一九三六年、亦更近於往昔、就遠東言、日本自蹂躪東北、退出國聯以來、外交日陷於孤立、廣田登台、仍無法打開外交之僵局、惟國内政爭、則以此而益加尖銳、於是當國者更不得不重視對外、轉移羣衆視線於國際之一環迴顧宇内、美俄爲世界之兩强、亦日本當前之大敵、苟擊破其一、不難稱雄於世界、惟美於太平洋之勢力、尙不容忽視、而俄爲社會主義之國家、苟對之作戰、轉將取得資本主義列强之諒解、减少日本對外之困難、故最近對蘇俄所表現者、已由擾奪中東路、而進於武力窺伺之企圖、至蘇俄雖埋首於第二次五年計劃、觀其屯二十五萬大軍於阿穆爾邊界、集飛機四百五十架於海參崴雙城子之間、並於其毘連北滿之國境、建築大規模之鱗形陣地、凡此種種、無不顯示其接戰迎敵之準備、近自［菱刈文件］宣佈後、遠東天空、更爲陰霾所蔽、</p>
<p>▲日俄之戰　如箭在弦一觸卽發、此遠東之火藥庫、已經安埋定當、特其炸裂之時日問題耳、就西歐言、則國聯自日本宣告退出後、無異陷於半身不产爱之症、而此半身不遂之機關、更因希特勒之一枚炸彈、而奄奄一息、軍縮會議僅成爲各國表現矛盾喜劇之舞台、有譏其爲討論戰法之陸軍大學者、實爲一針見血、其他若戰債問題、雖明知爲［世界經濟之癌］、迄今猶無解决之期、於此棼如亂絲的情勢之下、國際間之利害衝突、已至無法調和地步、凡在凡爾賽系統之下者、則瘋狂似的擴充軍備、以謀其所謂［安全保障］反對此系者、雖因條約之束縛、而無公開擴張武裝之自由、惟暗中、</p>
<p>▲厲兵抹馬　亦非一日、自希特勒掘起於德意志政治舞台以後、凡所措施、更激盪國際間之浪濤、而使一九一四年以前之危局、重見於今日、此西歐之遍地盡爲導火線、已如鐵之事實呈於我人目前、而無可諱言者也、綜觀遠東風雲之變化莫測旣如彼、而國際情勢之劍拔弩張又如此、則第二次世界大戰之爆發、果非盡屬臆測、而所謂一九三六年之非常危機、自又非意外、然則世界大戰、一旦發生、其所遺於我民族者果何若、曰誠能力圖自强、則三戸亡秦、不難躋於復興之途、不然、醉生夢死、則天無倖存、自趨於覆亡之路、故世界大戰之於我爲禍爲福爲得爲失、須一視我人自現在起能否</p>
<p>▲自覺自救　以爲斷、自覺自救之道無他、端在盡人能認淸此世界非常時期開展之動向、拚力作我人非常時期應有之奮鬭、此尤須在上者、先有周詳具體之擘劃、然後可予人民共同努力之途徑、否則各趨所好、各行所是、步驟旣不一致、力量何能集中、其欲自拔於危亡、而渡此來日之大難者、是烏乎可、今者、四中全會旣集黨國賢豪於一堂矣、其所集合之力量與才智、自較常日爲大爲廣、而各方往昔因政見差池、而發生之嫌隙、旣感乎相忍爲國精誠團結之必要、將冰消於此次四中全會之一爐、則其謀有所以應付此世界非常時期之大策、更爲事實之可能者、惟時不我待、爲機急迫、試舉千百事而併一日爲之、是否有濟、猶爲疑問、倘或偶有蹉跎、覆亡立卽可待、故</p>
<p>▲我人希望　於四中全會者、凡所議題、應以剿匪討逆與國防建設爲最高凖則、應付此世界非常時期爲唯一中心、倘捨此而侈談其他、旁及枝節、好整以晚、坐錯時機、不論其用心若何、自不啻抹煞國家之利害、斷送民族之命運、終不免爲黨國之禍魁、於秋之罪人、我中華民族之存亡絕續將一繫於此次四中全會、而會議之成功與失敗、更一繫於能否集其全力以謀此非常時期之决策、而使舉國上下、有以急起直追之準備、時艱任重、幸我與會諸公垂察焉、</p>

<p>市立六十餘民補校</p>
<h3>昨舉行聯合畢業禮</h3>
<p>▲潘局長主席致開會詞</p>
<p>▲蔣科長報告學校槪况</p>
<p>本市市立第十屆民衆學校、及第七屆補習學校、於昨日下午二時在市立民衆敎育館、舉行聯合畢業典禮、到市敎育局長潘公展、第四科長蔣建白、市黨部代表朱家驊、市政府代表章淵若、及民補學校師生五百餘人、由潘局長主席致開會詞、蔣科長報告學校槪况、黨政代表相繼訓詞、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>主席致開會詞</h3>
<p>主席潘局長致開會詞、略謂本屆畢業人數、比往年有相當進步、就學校數目、以及級數而言、亦比過去加多、市府所撥民補經費、亦有增加、惟據敎育局考察結果、尙未能十分滿意、㈠民補校學生在開學時幾完全出席、嗣後卽逐月减少、足見其求學志願、並不堅决、故希望今日在座同學、一面繼續努力、一面勸導傍人要有恒心、㈡照民補學校學生年齡、應在超過學齡以上、現在民補校學生大多在求學年齡、而年長失學者僅佔一部份、其原因是在政府限於經費、不能廣設義務小學之故、㈢民衆學校注重識字與公民敎育、補習學校注重公民與職業訓練、因識字雖爲重要、而公民訓練尤爲切需、蓋字雖能識、而對於做人道理、漠然無知、又有何用、故用補校特别注重公民訓練、希望各位懂得做人之道云云、</p>
<h3>畢業學生統計</h3>
<p>敎育局第四科長蔣建白報告云、本屆民衆學校共四十六校五十一級、補習學校共二十校二十六級、經費共八千九百五十二元、民校學生男女共二千三百八十八人、補校學生男女共一千二百十一人、本屆民補校畢業生共一千三百餘人、與上屆比較、學校增八校十一級、學生增五百六十五人、經費增三千四百六十一餘元、畢業生數約增三百七十餘人繼報告、</p>
<h3>本屆敎導槪况</h3>
<p>略謂民衆學校、注重識字訓練、補習學校側重公民及職業訓練、修業期限、民校本屆爲五個月、補校仍爲一年、出席學生、逐月仍有减少、尤以鄉區各校較甚、敎導效果、按月由各校自行測騐一次、並送局騐核、民校並由局方分赴各校舉行標凖測騐二次、各校成績、優劣殊異、統觀本屆辦理情形、敎導上尙須注意者、㈠招生時宜多收成年失學者、㈡研究缺席原因、努力設法减少、㈢敎導方法、尙須深加研究、俾適合民衆心理云、</p>

<p>自由談批評家的批評家  倪朔蘭　　情勢也轉變得眞快，去年以前，是批評家和鼎批評家都批評文學，自然，不滿的居多，但說好的也有。去年以來，却變了文學家和非文學家都翻了一個身，轉過來來批評批評家了。　　這一回可是不大有人說好，最澈底的是不承認近來有眞的批評家。卽使承認，也大大的笑他們胡塗。爲什麽呢？因爲他們往往用一個一定的圈子向作品上面套，合就好，不合就壞。　　但是，我們曾經在文藝批評史上見過沒有一定圈子的批評家嗎？都有的，或者是美的圈，或者是眞實的圈，或者是前進的圈。沒有一定的圈子的批評家，那才是怪漢子呢。辦雜誌可以號稱沒有一定的圈子，而其實這正是圈子，是便於遮眼的變戲法的手巾。譬如一個編輯者是唯美主義者罷，他儘可以自說並無定見，單在書籍評論上，就足够玩把戲。倘是一種所謂［爲藝術的藝術］的作品，合於自己的私意的，他就選登一篇讚成這種主義的批評，或讀後感，捧着牠上天；要不然，就用一篇假急進的好像非常革命的批評家的文章，捺牠到地裏去。讀者這就被迷了眼。但在個人，如果還有一點記性，却不能這麽兩端的，他沒有一定的圈子。我們不能責備他有圈子，我們只能批評他這圈子對不對。　　然而批評家的批評家會引出張獻忠考秀才的古典來：先在兩柱之間横繫一條繩子，呌應考的走過去，太高的殺，太矮的也殺，於是殺光了蜀中的英才。這麽一比，有定見的批評家卽等於張獻忠，眞可以使讀者發生滿心的憎恨。但是，評文的圈，就是量人的繩嗎？論文的合不合，就是量人的長短嗎？引出這例子來的，是誣陷，更不是什麽批評。談皇帝  致立　　溥儀要登極稱帝了；自然，這是承日本的意志的，是［日本亡滿第二步工作］。日本爲此將發一宣言，［其内容較九一八之進兵更爲嚴重］云。　　［非常時］［非常時］那麽嚷着的日本人决不有閒，倘無嚴重的用意，决不來憑空加演這一齣傀儡戲的。也許眞如孟却斯德指導報所說，這一齣戲將來要演到［北平復位］罷？丨但是這宗國空大事的前因後果，實也難說，而且說起來也沒有什麽意味。後事如何，我們一向是專等後文分解的，［船到橋門自會直］，話說在先是庸人自擾。况且施蟄存先生曾說：［現在還有什麽嚴重的問題呢，東三省全部奉送也沒有成爲嚴重問題哪］。所謂［東三省全部奉送］，卽［九一八進兵］也，然而［並沒有成爲嚴重問題］，則卽使［北平復位］一旦實現，在看客的我們的心目中到底會不會覺得嚴理，正未可知哪。　　倘若文人們要在這事情上面做文章，那麽最好是談點與實際無關的空話，例如爲什麽要稱帝號之類。丨我現在就來談這個。　　把做文章和稱帝號兩件事聯在一起想來，有一個相似之點。做文章的人可大别爲兩種，一種是先做好文章而後擬題目，一種是先定了題目而後做文章。相似的是稱帝號的人也有兩種，一種是先創了大一統的帝國而後議號，另一種是先稱了帝號而後去這帝國。秦始皇［平定天下，海内爲郡縣，法令由一統，自上古以來未嘗有，五帝所不及，］於是命丞相御史等議號，是前者。屋大維（Ｏｃｔａｖｉａｎ）打倒羣雄，統一羅馬，於是稱Ａｕｇｕｓｔｕｓ，也是前者。他如查里曼（Ｃｈａｒｌｅｍａｇｎｅ），拿破崙，威廉第一等，都是此類。　　至若袁世凱，溥儀等，則屬於後者。袁世凱的做總統，是先有文章而後擬題的，但他嫌這篇文章欠堂皇，於是另外定了一個題目丨要稱帝丨而後做八股文似的做去，然而起，承，一轉，八十三天之後一合，不成樣子，結果是從頭塗掉。溥儀可曲折得多了，他本有一篇現成的文章和一個現成的題目，但是被辛亥革命扯碎了，後來張勳幫他重做過一次，不成。如今他是照了日本老師所出的題目，又在重做了。結果如何，將來自會知道的。　　什麽呌做皇帝呢？獨斷上說：［皇帝，至尊之稱。皇者，煌也。盛德煌煌，無所不照。帝者，諦也。能行天道，事天審諦，故稱皇帝。］這種界說，雖然有點糊塗，但已使我們明白皇帝是一個至尊的稱號。然而，［號者，功之表也］，猶如題目之爲文章的標識也。照理，總是先有其物然後有其標識。所以曰皇帝，曰Ａｕｇｕｓｔｕｓ，曰Ｅｍｐｅｒｏｒ，曰Ｋａｉｓｅｒ，曰Ｔｚａｒ，曰Ｐｒｉｎｃｅｐｓ，曰Ｉｍｐｅｒａｔｏｒ，曰Ｄｉｃｔａｔｏｒ，…總該先有相當的功業，方可稱道，否則便是［沐猴而冠］，不免爲世所笑的。　　但古今的野心家們，總愛稱皇稱帝，卽使在小範圍之内。愷撒嘗說：［寗爲一村之雄長，不爲羅馬第二人。一這正是韓非所說的［寗爲雞口，母爲牛後］之意，野心家們的樂於在小範圍内稱王道霸，其實卽由於這一個觀念。趙佗上漢文帝書云：［南方卑濕，蠻夷中西有西甌，其衆半臝，南面稱王；東有閩粤，其衆數千人，亦稱王；而北有長沙，其半蠻夷亦稱王。老臣故敢妄竊帝號，聊以自娛。］因爲他自己［身定百邑之地，東西南北數千萬里，帶甲百萬有餘，］比其他的稱王者都偉大些。這［聊以自娛］四個字，實在掬出了野心家們的本懷。但趙佗到底還是個老實人，初則對漢文帝聲明［自帝其國，非敢有害於天下也］。終則去帝號，仍爲南粤王，雖然實際上的權勢始終是一樣。　　古今數千年的歷史，雖云都是帝王的家譜，歷代的帝王雖然不勝枚舉，但是［以天下之大，四海之内，所共尊者一人］那樣的大皇帝，畢竟未嘗有過，以今日的眼光看來，秦始皇屋大維們的版圖不消說是很小，查里曼，拿破崙，威廉第二們雖有作世界皇帝之志，終於也未嘗實現，並且，卽使是小範圍内的成功，爲時又何其暫也！始皇滿想從自己起［世以計數，二世三世至千萬世，傳之無窮］，誰知不到三世，秦祚就絕了。查理曼的帝國，到他子孫手裏，也就分裂得不成樣子，拿破崙和威廉第二，且不待身後，卽告失敗，至尊之榮，不過如曇花一現。英氣蓋世的愷撒被刺時，對兇手Ｂｒｕｔｕｓ驚呼：［你也這樣嗎，我的兒子！］（Ｔｕｑｕｏｑｕｅ，Ｆｉｌｉ　ｍｉ）所謂［皇者煌煌，人莫違也］的話，又不可靠，由此觀之，［妄竊帝位，聊以自娛］這事情，實在是很無聊的。尤其是現在的溥儀那樣的稱帝，更爲無聊丨丨但這是我只對於溥儀敢說的話。因爲我相信我對溥儀稱臣的日子尙遠，故尙敢於對他妄加議論。江行小紀  穆因　　由錢塘江到我家，有六七百里水路，在回鄉去的時候，總得坐幾天逢船，這船上的生活，是頗值得叙述一下的。　　這是屯溪的蓬船，船内有六個艙位，地板都用油油過，極其淸潔。　　船上除甲長撐篙，甲長娘把舵外，還僱有四五個船工拉縴。在平水上面，船工們祇在船上划漿；遇着順風，連漿都不用划，把布帆扯起，鼓着風，船身便很快的向前行去。這個時候，老成的船工，坐在船尾上很悠閒的吸着旱烟，什麽地方有石塊，什麽地方水深，要轉灣，祇把船舵一擺便成了。年輕的小夥子，便凑在一起玩紙牌，贏的固然有趣，輸的便往舖底一躺，呼呼入睡了。甲長娘趁這點閒空，或是擦地板，燒開水給客人喝，或是抱着孩子吃奶，親嘴！　　可是遇着上灘，就有點費事。船工馬上把縴索放低，用三五根竹篙抵住，只聽着一片唷丨丨唉丨丨的聲音。待到船身漸漸的上了灘以後，全船便又回復了平靜的狀態。　　船上以甲長娘爲主腦，她是從小生長在船上的，一路山高水低，祇有她最淸楚，熟悉。撑船的技術，比較一般船工都來得高明。　　我從塘行把舖蓋搬上了船後，也把鞋脫去，赤脚行走，船上那低凳，矮桌，眞是别有風味。　　杭州到桐廬，一日有兩班小輪船開行。因爲江面闊，吃水較深，有時候還有風濤，所以第一日這些蓬船都拖輪。第二日便進港了。　　富春江風景最好，兩岸靑山壁立，水是那樣澄淸。早晨客人還沒有醒，舟子便催着起身，說是釣魚台到了。從那直豎的山岸，陡然掛起一道石崖，約有三四百尺高。人們可以沿岸尋出一條被叢草披拂羊的山徑，攀藤援葛，爬上山頂。上面很平坦，有一八角石亭，這就是漢光武的故友，嚴光處士的垂釣所在。　　遇着愛吃魚的客人，在桐廬就得預備　醋等佐料，船到七里瀧，就有許多小漁船，用兩把柳葉漿，祗一划，像箭似的靠攏來，把大船圍住。從船底撈起那用嫩樹條穿住的一串一串的鮮魚，向着客人呌賣；［客人！買魚？］這兒産的魚，特别肥美，　魚尤佳，普通總是二角多錢一斤。假使你身邊有一小罐陳年花雕，那便靑山綠水，美酒佳肴，使你有悠然出塵之想。　　遇着細雨濛濛的日子，船工們都披上簑衣，載上簑笠，冒雨行舟。客人却盡躱在艙裏下象棋，看紅樓夢，或者睡去了。這雨打在船蓬上滴丨滴丨的聲音，直使這些客地歸來的遊子，生出一種悵惘，憂鬰的愁思。不過對着這一幅迷離烟雨的圖畫，如果你是詩人或藝術家，那也就不會感到寂寞了。　　嚴州是從浙江到徽州中間的一個水碼頭，市廛繁盛，船到此地，要停住半天，你不妨上岸去逛逛，或往錢江第一樓吃花茶。樓臨江頭，推窗遠望，可以看見對面山的塔影，風景確是不錯！這類茶館，在這一路大點的碼頭丨嚴東關，威坪，街口差不多都有。　　在船上做活的工人，也有他們的趣味，當船上要買柴火，或者投篙等件，把船停在沿岸的鄉村邊下時，便有許多鄉下姑娘，婦人，用籃盛着豆腐，雞蛋，甘蔗，酥糖等等，趕到河邊來呌賣，於是船上的工人便尖聲怪氣地和她們打情駡俏，尋得一點安慰。　　碰着三五月圓的時候，客人們便聚在船頭甲板上，一杯淸茶，幾枝烟捲，漫不經意的談着那天南地北；假使你是性情孤獨的人，那麽看羊那茫茫的夜色，浩浩的江水，也儘有無窮感興。　　這樣新鮮美妙的生活，要過上六七日，才到達我的家鄉。這似乎是我們這些離鄉别井的人的一種安慰和鼓勵：彷彿因爲有着這樣愉快的旅行，我們便都不惜遠遊！父女（二）  靳以　　［沒有弄點兒酒來麽，］　　［什麽，您又要喝酒麽？］　　她帶着驚奇的語氣說，可是他却立刻摇摇頭，顯出一點窘迫的樣子說：　　［好孩子，我不要，我說錯了，我不要。］　　他們就再也不說什麽地走着，當她伏侍着父親走上屋前的臺堦時，她覺出他的身驅在微微抖着。　　雖然她已經知道父親又是在爲着什麽所苦，可是她不敢問，也不能說。她讓父親坐在最舒適的沙發裏，給他倒來一杯菊花茶。她自己坐在靠手上，把臉故意偎到父親的臉上。　　父親像是在看着什麽，她順了父親的眼睛望過去，穿過玻璃窗，正看到書室裏墻上懸着的一張女人的像片。她站起來，悄悄地走到那裏把窗幔閉上了。　　這時候父親把眼睛抬起來望着她，像是在問着：［你這是爲了什麽？］　　她開了電燈，重復走回來，彷彿自語地說着：　　［天黑了，該把燈開起來。老媽子眞懶，連窗帘也不記得拉好。］　　這時候女僕來說菜已經擺好，請他們去吃晚飯。　　父親懶懶地站起來，她隨在他身邊，走到餐室裏去。　　在吃飯的時候，她常常把眼睛偷偷地望着父親，她看到他在苦痛着，碗裏的每一顆米粒都像有着辛酸的回憶。他祇注視着飯粒，却沒有把一顆送到嘴裏去。雖然她裝着孩子一樣的嬌癡，把菜送到父親的碗裏，故意要他吃下去；可是他仍然是那麽陰沉地遲疑着。　　［爲什麽不吃呢，爸？］　　［我不餓，一點也不餓。］　　［那麽等等再吃也好。］　　女兒也想到强着他吃，會有多麽壞的影響，便順着他說。她自己也放下了筷子。　　［你怎麽也不吃了？］　　［我飽了，我們還是到邊坐吧，這裏的氣味不好。］　　伴着父親，他們又回到剛纔坐過的那間房裏。她還是要父親舒適地坐着，她坐在地下的軟墊上，把頭倚着父親的膝，她用自己的手抓了父親的手。　　他沒有說話，只是默默地。她急切地想說些什麽來打破這沉默，查是又像是沒有話好說　她想到天氣，想到晚飯，想到花園裏的樹木；但是她又怕這些和父親的煩惱多少有些關係　所以這沉默就如人生的路，無盡地伸展在那裏。　　她知道父親是該傷心的，因爲他有過往的美好而辛酸的記憶。她知道自己就是那時候來到這世上的，而她的母親却在她來到這世上不久便遠遠地走了。她捨了愛她的男人，也不顧自己親生的女兒，就任性地走了。從那時候起，父親就成爲鬰鬰寡歡的人，他沒有一個時候不在想着他所愛的女人，可是她却沒有一點信息，悄悄地不知道活在那裏。她永遠記得父親　過的那些話，那些像刻在她心中的熱情的話：　　［我知道她是一時的錯懊，只要她能够再來到我的眼前，懴悔以往的過失，我就能寛宥有她。孩子，那時候你能看見你的母親是多麽漂亮，多麽使人喜歡。你會知道愚蠢的父親想念着她，不盡是無　的了！］</p>

<p>春秋兒童週刋做日記  閻鳳　　小朋友們：做日記是很重要的一件工作！不要說小朋友應該天天作，就是成人們，也何嘗不該作呢！因爲日記是可以記新獲的智識，記過去的罪過，或光榮的事件；使得以後可以反省或查考。所以我說：日記不限定小朋友要做，成人們也須要做呢。　　那末，日記怎麽做法？我來扼要地寫出下面幾條，你們看了，勝如閱讀許多關於日記方面的兒童讀物。　　一，日記須注明月日及氣候。　　二，日記須天天記錄。不過日常的生活，不必記；倘然記了，那末，弄得所記的日日相彷，有何用處？　　三，揀重要的事情記。如閱書得到的心得，或是自己犯了罪過，或是做了有益的事情，或是看見特别的事物，或是玩賞美妙的風景等等　　四，日須記記得忠實。好的行爲須記，壞的行爲也須記。記好的行爲，好自己鼓勵自己以後努力照樣幹去。記壞的行爲，可使自己以後改過。　　五，日記不可把幾天内的事情，放在一天中記，如果這樣，便不成爲日記了。　　六，如果某一天内實在無甚事情，那末，但記月日及氣候就好了，不必將日常的生活記上去。　　小朋友能依照上面六條做去，那末，記了一定有好處。如果不信，試依我的話做去。鐵的紀律  矜細　　歐戰前，德皇威廉第二的君權是至高無上無可匹敵的。　　某天，是星期日。某肉舖得到了德皇的電話，奉命惟謹地把切好的幾斤牛肉送到皇宮去。不料在中途給崗警扣住，並且把送肉的掌櫃拘到公安局。　　在歐洲各國，星期日是停止營業的。今日某肉舗違法營業，依照違警罰法處罰：[肉充公，罰鍰五十馬克]。　　公安局毫不徇情地執行了。　　肉舖掌櫃的不服，提起上訴。上訴結果失敗，判决書是，一維持法律的尊嚴，不能以德皇故可以例外］的幾個字。　　威廉第二也不提出相反的意見。　　文明國家才有［鐵的紀律］的事實。我們都該引爲榜樣，我們得在學校中開始練習。小圖書館  郭品娟　　　　小朋友：我從前和你們差不多年紀的時候，很喜歡看書，覺得先生每天敎給我們的書太少，不够給我讀，於是常常去向人家借些書來看，有時借到一本有趣味的故事，我看得不願意放手。　　後來，我們幾個志同道合的小同學，在學校裏發起組織了一個小圖書館。　　我們把各人自己所有的書籍，都搬在圖書館裏，並勸其他的同學也捐助些，校長給我們定了許多兒童的讀物，先生們也送給我們不少的害籍，這小小的圖書館，我們每天推派人來輪流管理着，不過開放的時間，不和上課的時間衝突　　　我們的圖書館成立以後，有許多向來不喜歡看書的小同學，也很願意來翻書看，故在散課時，這圖書館裏是充滿着愉快的空氣。我們等到了許多課本上所得不到的學問和知識。　　小朋友！你們校裏有沒有圖書館？你們也應該要有這樣的一個圖書館啊！童子軍  秋　　童子軍，好精神，智仁勇，須記淸，尊紀律，聽命令，奉公守法服務勤。大刀隊  秋　　大刀隊，禦國難，伏戰壕，候敵來；敵人來時，一聲呐喊，跳出戰壕勇百倍，殺得敵人無一回。船的進步丨從獨木舟到大輪船  何公超　　我們最老的老祖宗（上古的人類）大槪是看見一根在水裏浮着的木頭，才想起用木頭來做渡河的工具的罷。他在游水的時候，偶然看見一根木頭浮在水面上，便跨坐在那木頭上面，划到了對岸。後來用幾根木頭縛在一起（第一圖。）再後，他用石斧把一根樹幹挖出空洞，成爲獨木舟，（第二圖。）這種獨木舟，如今在南美洲等處的原始民族中，還在應用着。後來大槪有人在乘獨木舟的時候，發現大風吹他的皮衣，能够帮助的前進，便創造了風帆（第三圖。）帆船慢慢的進步，埃及人製成了［帆漿船］（第四圖，）船上裝着很大的風帆，並有船夫摇着槳。羅馬人把［帆槳船］再加改良，（第五圖）。名呌［淮金］的海賊們所造的帆船又比羅馬人所造的更速更好，（第六圖，）至於像哥倫布所乘的帆船，那是更爲完備，能够遠涉重洋了，（第七圖。）以後仍舊不斷的改進：（第八圖）是十八世紀東印度人所造的帆船。（第九圖）是十九世紀的帆船。以後，人們在船上裝設了簡單的蒸氣機，作爲前進的助力，（第十圖。）不久，人們造成了明輪，便完全用蒸汽來行船了，（第十一圖。）最後，現代式的大輪船出世了，他比以前一切的船都要又快，又大又穩。在幾千年當中，從粗陋的獨木舟，進步到設備完美的大輪船，是費了多少人的心血啊！割碎的急救史  濟宏　　小朋友，在你一不留神的當兒，很輕微的割破了一些指頭的時候，你將怎樣？哭嗎？這不是件勇敢的事；告訴媽媽？這是顯出你自己的懦弱和沒有自持刀。</p>
<p>在剛割碎的時候，你就該立刻的用力揑住碎的地方，一面使不淸潔的東西和微生物不能進去，一面使血液不能流出到外面來。　　要是你能够這樣勇幹的揑着，不到十分鐘，血便不會汉出而也和沒有割碎一樣的看不出了。但割碎得大却不行，一定要得到母親或别人的帮助纔好。雪戰閻重樓　　雪花靜悄悄的下了一夜，第二天地上已經堆積得有幾寸厚了！　　一　兒童看見這樣美麗的雪景，個個心裏都很快樂，他們决定在雪裏做一種游戲。　　他們用紙糊了兩面國旗，一面是靑天白日旗，還有一面是太陽旗。他們把人數分作兩隊，把靑天白日旗揷在西邊的陣地上，把太陽旗揷在東邊的陣地上，他們便各自忙着製造雪彈的工作。　　號令一聲，他們便開戰了，雪彈在空中飛舞着：［前進！前進！］的聲音呌得很響。起先東邊很佔着優勢，曾經攻入西邊的陣地；但經過西邊努力的　抗，到　把　　的　人打　了，把太陽旗也打　在地上了。　　於是兒童們都歡呼着：［中華民國勝利萬歲］！　　回到屋子裏，他們的小手都凍得很紅。爹媽問他們冷嗎？他們不約而同的說：［我們在練習打東洋人，我們一點兒也不覺得冷］。拍小照  蔭　　這是一個趣味化的團體遊戲。參加的人數愈多就愈有興味。但至少也要有五個人。、　　遊戲以前，主席先報告一下遊戲的方法：［這是一幕滑稽遊戲。呌做拍小照。你們都曉得，拍小照的時候。一點不能動，動以以後，這小照拍出來一定很糊塗。所以這遊戲一開始，大家都要聽從主席的指揮，主席就是攝影，攝影師拍一下桌子，（或者拍一下手，）凡是參加遊戲的人。都一動不能動。如果誰動了，誰笑了，誰說了話，誰就使這幕攝影破壞了。因此，誰就得受罰。　　罰的方法，讓參加遊戲的人自己來擬定；或唱歌，或講故事，或向大家道歉都可以。祗要能引起大家興趣就是。主席輪流做。譬如甲先做主席拍過一張照以後，就輪到乙，又輪到丙……依此類推下去。因爲主席就是攝影師。所以主席選擇拍照的時間，一定要多變化，揀一個各人不同的姿勢時間，就宣佈拍照。如甲在喝茶，乙在舉着手說話，丙在大笑，丁在摇首，戊在……這時拍一下桌子，大家依着各人原來的姿勢，不能再動。這樣的情景，異常滑稽，一定會使人，忍俊不禁了。笑出聲來的，就算犯了拍小照的規則。就要罰他唱歌，講故事……。第二次做主席的人，趁大家不備的時候，馬上開始宣佈拍照，這時各人又有一種另外不同時景象和姿勢了。不過有一點需要注意的，凡是參加遊戲的人，在拍照時，不許低着頭，一定要互相對望着。否則各人都不把眼光互相對視的時候，都看不見滑稽的景象，趣味就减少了。冰碗  白鵝　　刮了一夜的西北風，第二天早晨，果然，雪蓋得很白很厚了。　　孩子看鑡雪是多歡喜呀，於是，明兒的妹妹上寶，要求哥哥帮他堆雪人，做雪球，……。明兒不表示同意，他說：［不，這些老套頭，年年做，甚至於一年做幾次，多玩有什麽趣味］！　　［那麽，做什麽呢？雪總是值得玩的呀］！　　叨兒想了一會說：［好，來吧，玩玩冰碗看］！於是他拿了一隻面盆，盛了水，跑到廚房裏，拿了一隻碗一雙筷和鹽罐，再走到天井，用碗盛了雪，東西齊了。明兒嘘了一口氣說：［妹妹看吧，讓我做給你看］！　　小寶不懂，可是伊也不問，靜靜的等着看冰碗。　　明兒用筷向鹽罐裏撥，把鹽放在有雪的碗裏。再將鹽和雪在碗裏　和　　好了，把碗浮在水裏說：［等一會，冰碗就要出現了］。　　碗裏的雪，漸漸……漸漸的融解了，隔了好多時，果然，碗的外面丨丨著水的部份，都結了冰，亮晶晶的，的確是一隻冰碗呀！　　小寶樂得合不攏嘴，笑着說：［喲！哥呀，什麽？這的是一隻冰碗呀！我問你，冰不結在水面上面附在碗外面，這是什麽緣故］？於是明兒解釋給伊　：　　［小寶，不要奇怪。我來告訴你，雪裏面放了鹽是要溶解的，可是溶解必定要有熱量。水，雖然是冷的，可是熱量比冰高，連可以拿遭些　冰所高的　　供給它，不過它是溶解了，附近的水呢？熱量降得和冰一樣的低，所以在碗的外面附着結冰了］。螞蟻的畜牧  判凡　　我們都曉得，在世界上有兩種最有組織的昆蟲：一種是蜜蜂；一種便是螞蟻。　　螞蟻不但是生活有組織，還能畜養一種蚜蟲，採食它所分泌的蜜汁，好像我們養乳牛一般。　　蚜蟲的身體很軟，又無翅膀，行動很是遲鈍，到了食物將盡的時候，全靠螞蟻把它搬到旁的植物上去，才能够這樣很多地繁殖起來；，到了嚴寒的冬天，它本要凍死了的，又賴螞蟻替它帶到窠中保護着，才能過冬。他們這樣互相利用，呌做［共生作用］。　　螞蟻對於農作物，本身沒甚害處，但因它畜養着有害農作物的蚜蟲，所以便是問接的害蟲了。媽媽的信  王行易　　　　愛羣我兒：　　這幾天下了雨，天氣寒冷得多了！你看，刮下的雪，多麽大？晚來的風，多麽兇？　　你呢？有絨繩小衫兒，有厚呢小大衣，温暖地裹着，那裏會覺得寒冷是件慘酷的東西呢！？　　但是！兒呀！你要知道我們的眼前，　無量數的苦小孩！和你一樣大的苦小孩呀！他們哪！有的是受了黄河的大水災！有的是爸爸爲了國家民族而犧牲了！有的是…………！　　因此，他們不得不穿着破的單衣，舊的夾衣，或者赤了膊，在那裏顫慄着！哭着！喊着！　　呀！我的兒！我很希望那些顫慄的聲音，哭着喊着的聲音，能夠鑽進你小小的心房，引起你的同情來，節省下買玩具，買果餌，買……的錢來，去救濟那無量數的苦小孩！和你一樣大的苦小孩啊！　　你的媽媽兒童園地我們的世界——書籍　我們的樂園——敎室  華南小學六年級生陸逸羣　　　　我們的學校，就是一個小規模的社會，我們的敎室，就是這小規模的社會里裏的一個村落，或者也好算是一個市鎭；總之，書籍是兒童的世界，學校裏的敎室是兒童的樂園；惟有我們兒童的世界，才是純正而眞實的；也惟有學校裏的敎室，才是我們兒童最純潔而高尙的樂園。　　因爲，我們的社會，丨學校丨雖然也同樣地有市政府，公安局，財務局，敎育局，……各機關的組織，但；執政者和公務員都是廉潔自守的，沒有貪污的劣跡，也沒有把持壟斷的惡行，人民全是天眞爛漫的小同伴，非但沒有虚僞傾軋的爭奪，更沒有意氣用事的衝突；所以我們的社會，才是眞正光明而純潔的社會。　　我們的樂園丨丨敎室丨丨當然囉！是沒有眞的奇花異草，亭台樓閣，假山小池，飛禽走獸，……在這裏點綴着，但，自然科討論到的各城，高山勝地，……的確是遠勝那經人工製造出來的一些呆板的風景啊！　　加之，老師的慈愛，同學的謙和，更能增加我們不少的快慰，所以我說：［書籍是兒童的世界，敎室是學生的樂園。］嚇了我一跳  民生小學學生董梅英　　　　除夕，弟弟買了一隻面套子，和一把刀，到了元旦的早晨，他著了五顔六色的新衣服，臉上戴了一隻面套子，手中拿了一把刀，輕輕地從我的房門外走進來。這時我正在梳洗，突然看見他，嚇得我跳了起來，後來他高聲呌道：［姊姊姊姊！］當時他就把面套子脫下來，我仔細一看，才知道是我的弟弟。一個貧苦的小孩  蘇州景海小學學生周榕　　　　在去年的冬天，我家園内堆積了很多的白雪，我同了哥哥姐姐妹妹弟弟到園内去玩雪。玩了不久，我聽見一個輕悄而悽慘的哭聲，我便問：［那裏來的哭聲呀？］他們正在玩得高興，被我一說，就停止了工作，仔細聽那哭聲。等一會哥哥說：［這哭聲一定是在我家大門口傳出來的。］我聽了他的話，就跑到大門口去一聽，眞的是從大門口發出來的。我就把大門一開，看見一個貧苦的孩子，坐在我家的大門口，他身上只穿了一件襤褸而污穢的棉衣。身上的肉慢慢地抖着，我就問他：［你有沒有母親？］他說：［母親嗎？已經去世好幾年了。］我問他：［你有錢和衣服嗎？］他說：［錢我一文也沒有討着，衣服只有這一件，還是人家給我的。］我聽了他的話，因爲他很貧苦，就把熱飯給他吃，他說：［我的嘴很渴請你給我吃些水。］我就弄了一杯給他吃，並且送些銀錢和幾件舊的棉衣給他。他謝了我們然後去了。　　朋友們，我們對於貧苦的人，都應當有同情心。</p>

<p>業餘漫談再談談我們的立國思想  公樸　　在本刋第五十七期上，我偶爾漫談到［我們的立國思想］，當時漫筆所之，缺乏精密的意見，現在旣經提起質平君的討論（見上期言論），似有進一步談談的必要。　　質平君對於這個問題提出了一大批的答案。但是，［何者是對的？］據他的意見，就是能執行目前中國幾個根本問題的人所代表的思想。這話，看來是很對的，不過，若從歷史的觀察，這答案是很欠缺社會進化史的意義的。　　老實說，中國現在就沒有立國思想。所謂［立國思想］，是指統制的意識而言。過去支配中國的意識是儒家思想。但它是農業經濟，封建社會的産物。一到這基礎起了動摇，這思想的體系也就不能不分裂了。所以儒家思想的勢力在中國目前的整個社會上，已不能不說是有江河日下的趨勢了。　　資本主義的意識在中國目前也不能佔統製的地位，亞丹斯密，盧梭的思想也不能成爲中國的［立國思想］。因爲當此中國社會經濟尙未及完成資本主義的形態時候，而世界資本主義的基礎已在動摇了。資本主義的意識也一天天在分解，統制的意識已失了存在的依據，世界均在矛盾中。不過，中國的矛盾比起英美來要來得複雜，因此我們對中國［立國思想］是可以提出許多的答案，而在歐美諸國家祗要二三個就够了。　　我們目前沒有［立國思想］。將來呢？這答案是要由社會經濟所完成的階段而决定。儒家思想成爲中國的［立國思想］，支配了二千多年，不是無緣故的。我們要知道：［立國思想］完成的過程是隨經濟基礎一步一步成功的。不是先有統制的意識，然後方去建國。建國與意識的統制是同時完成的。中國目前的混亂是整個的，是政治的混亂，也是思想的混亂。新的過程雖然已從舊的母胎中生長，但舊的過程還未完全終結，現象上現出的是極端矛盾。至於將來能成爲統制的［立國思想］的是什麽，這是很容易指出的，第一必是與社會經濟的轉變相適合的一種思想；第二，同時必定又是引導出這社會經濟的轉變完成的一種思想。這種情形，不獨是中國如此，全世界大多數的國家也無不如此，（未盡之言容以後再談）　　生活交車  蔣文桂黄包車夫　　［嘿路！密稀脫！立克曉要嗎？］小張拖着一輛黄包車，打着不純粹的江北洋涇浜在問着一個穿綠色制服的洋丘八，照樣問了好幾遍，那個丘八太爺却竟似死人般沒句回答。　　［嘿路！密稀！密稀！立克曉可要？可要嗎？］碰到了一個洋姑娘，他又同樣地兜交易。她不睬，走了，又是一個失望。　　呵！小張這幾天運道可眞不好，白天出來到夜，做不了幾注生意，有時給巡捕先生扳掉張把照會，連車租都付不了。家裏還有她，小狗子，小三子等一羣人帶累着，不要說飯，運粥都不够吃呢！　　［喂！先生！車子要嗎？］他問到了一位中國大少，華達呢大衣穿得畢挺，絲絨銅盆帽帶得高高的，皮鞋踏的谷谷響，看來煞是威風。　　［來！過來！豪臊點！］他含了茄立克答應着。　　車子挨近了；坐墊翻了過來，拍去些灰，這是小張做每一次生意時的幾套老手腕。大少一蹤身跳上了車，小張拔脚就奔，一口氣奔了里把路，飛毛腿也沒他快呢。一刻兒東，一刻兒西，一會兒到了，從大少手裏丢下二毛錢。　　［嘿！那邊到這裏，可有十來里路，費去個把鐘頭，却只拿到了二毛錢。他媽的，汗也出了半鉢把呢，狗戳的！］小張拿到了錢口裏咕嚕着，但一經看到他那副神聖不可侵犯的氣色，也就低聲下氣的拉着車了跑了。　　這時離交車還差半個鐘頭，他想再做一注生意，可是接連問了十來個主顧，却沒一個睬他。時候越弄越促了，還剩得一刻鐘。　　［黄包車！黄包車！來！來！］一個摩登大姑娘拉開了嗓子在尖聲尖氣地喊着。　　小張聽見了，立刻拖了車子直撞過來。　　［那裏？那裏？］　　［兆豐公園對過。］　　小張心想：我那家黄包車公司就在兆豐公園那邊，交車去不是順路嗎？　　［好！去！去！］　　［幾個銅子啊？］　　［二毛錢。］　　［坯！要二毛錢？不行！不行！。］　　［一毛錢，去不去？］　　［再加些，好不好？］　　［一錢也不加。］　　［好！去！去！去！交車去，給你便宜些。］　　離交車祇有十分鐘了，他飛也似的拉，拉，拉，心裏不住地輾轉着在想：快嗎！酒有得喝呢！小三子至少可以多吃塊把大餅了。　　［到了，到了。］　　［坯！這裏是什麽地方？我要到兆豐公園對過呢。你莫不是初做生意，連兆豐公園都不認識嗎？］　　［别忙！這裏是曹家渡，對面不是兆豐公園是什麽？］　　[吓！誰敎你拉到這裏！這裏是兆豐公園後門對過，我是要到前門愚園路呢。快點拉去！］　　［啊！小姐！可憐我！我要交車去咧！時候已經到了，過了要多罰一筆車租哩！請你打公園裏穿過去吧！］　　［胡說！我沒有派司，怎能進去？］　　她老是不下來：［快點拉！你可沒有耳朶嗎？］　　警察走來了，她同他解釋了理由。　　小張也揷口道：［她敎我拉到兆豐公園對過，這裏可不是嗎？］　　結果是她勝利。她有的是漂亮的行頭；壓到人的金錢。　　［去！拉她去！加你一毛錢。］警察下着判斷道。　　［啊！可憐我！我要交車去啦！一刻也不能再留呢！］　　［誰敎你起先不問問清楚！去不去？要挨木棍兒嗎？］　　她勝利了。他不得不去，硬着頭皮去。　　這天小張交了二筆車租，連一天的車錢掏出來，還差二個銅子，連粥都沒得吃了。自我職業介紹回音　　徵女士：請駕臨一談。（狄思威路五零五號平和莊宇都宮直賢啓）　　鳴女士：請卽投函浦東周家渡里新米號轉交鄙人接洽爲荷。（裕興啓）業餘運動深呼吸  餘事書生　　深呼吸是輕而易舉，效力宏的全身運動；祇需於日光下凈潔的空氣中，挺直了身子，緊閉着嘴巴，將散佈空間的養氣，由鼻孔中徐徐吸入，四肢隨着昇舉，以增加吸力；吸至盡端，再將肺部的炭氣從鼻孔中儘量呼出，四脚也隨着降落，呼達頂點，才算完畢。稍息片刻，再舉行第二次。這樣每日需行二回，規定於晨與晚，每回約需行二十餘次。　　深呼吸，非但右使身體健康，且爲預防肺癆唯一妙法。深呼吸所以能預防肺癆，而使身體健康，推測其原理約有數端：　　第一，平常的呼吸，肺臟的漲縮極微，不能有充分的發育。况且肺尖的組織，是和他部份完全不同的，它的血流與淋巴流都極遲緩，所以很容易受到血液的傳染；它血管的分布了比較他部來得少，所以時常要發現貧血性的狀態。因爲組織的不良，營養的不足，抵抗力也就薄弱。肺尖，因此成了結核菌的策源地，肺癆病的養成所。我們欲預防這種危險，惟有常行深呼吸，因爲深呼吸可使新鮮空氣直達肺尖，而使肺尖裏的空氣交換旺盛。這樣，肺臟的發育可以充分，貧血性可一變爲充血的狀態了。　　第二，我們平常的呼吸，僅能使横隔膜和外肋間筋運動。作深呼吸時，兼能使斜角筋等十七筋運動；所以深呼吸和筋肉運動，也很有關係。在深呼吸的時候，横隔膜下降，壓迫着腹腔，因爲腸裏有物不能縮小，因此腹壁向前膨脹，膨脹到不能再膨脹的時候，便反向胃壁，肝，脾，膵，腎等表面，都受着了壓迫；於是將積滯於此等部份的血液，向四方驅散，待壓力一鬆，卽從四方流入。這樣一出一入，可以將腹腔裏的血液循環變好，因此分布於腹腔的神經，</p>

<p>也受了同樣的作用，而愈益張健了。腹腔裏的臟腑，因此機能都亢進了。種種疾病也無從而生了。　　第三，當我們作深吸氣的時候，胸腔裏的壓力頓减，儲藏在腦實質裏的血液就滾滾地流入胸腔。到深呼氣的時候，胸腔裏的壓力漸漸增加，在胸腔的血液就源源回入腦髓。所以常常作深呼吸，可以使腦髓裏的血液特環愈見調整，血行障礙的疾病，血管血液病變，都可以因此不發生了。在每次深呼吸時，不但右使血液和淋巴液變好，並且可使胸腔和腹腔裏的臟腑，全身的筋肉，都有適當的運動。因此腸胃都受了直接的影響，食慾也因此漸漸增加。　　假使我們能於業餘規定的早晚，久習深呼吸。那麽，虚弱的可變爲强壯，夭折的可夔爲長壽，雖患肺癆這樣重症，也可變爲輕症，輕症，當然更易復原了。　　不過已患肺癆的人，如果有以下這四種病情時，那是民不可實習深呼吸的，因爲他的肺臟，已有劇烈的創傷，敵不住這樣一吸一呼的漲縮了，卽：㈠有强度的咯血性素因的，㈡痰含血液的，㈢咳嗽劇烈的，㈣體温在三十八度以上的。　　職工們！在下謹以此呈獻諸位，希望你們能决心實行，接受我這誠懇的呼喊。若能如此，則肺癆，胸膜炎，腦膜炎，關節炎，腎臟炎，等症，都可以减少了。一九三三年的總淸算一九三三年的蘇俄經濟  方平　　一九三三年是蘇聯第二個五年計劃第一個年頭。第一個五年計劃底總結，蘇聯完成了以下的幾項成績：　　一·全國鉅大的工業化了。這造成了完成全部國民經濟改造本身的基礎。　　二·小農經濟在農村經濟中漸漸佔着不重要的地位了，代替它的是集體農塲和蘇維埃農塲，這些新的經濟單位佔着統制的地位。　　三·因此鄉村中小農私有經濟底根源漸漸消滅了。　　四·同時，失業和貧困的恐怖也消滅了。城市和入村間對立和［剪刀價格］再也不存在了。國民的收入都有了提高，文化程度也開展了，死亡率也因之縮减。人口於是而激增。　　自從第二個五年計劃，開始實行後，蘇聯現在在經濟上的地位已經超過了許多資本主義的强國：在農業機器的製造上，在汽犂和聯合耕種機的製造上，在泥炭的採掘上，都佔全世界第一的地位；鐵和煤油的産量上佔全世界第二位，全歐洲的第一位；在電力上佔着全世界第三位；在煤的産量上，在化學工業上佔全世界第四位。　　今年（就一九三三年前十個月而言）完成部份不獨按照預定的計劃而且超過它的限度的有：曳引機在十月内已完成六二·○七○架，超過計劃一○一％；機器製造業，前九月内生産比一九三二年同期增加一六％；鋼鐵産量，前九月内生産比一九三二年同期增加三○丨三六％；石炭增加一三·九％；石油增加二三·四％；電力增加一二○·三%，已超過英國；化學工業增加一二○·二％。　　伴隨工業而飛躍的是在工業基礎上而改造的農業。農業技術的改造是這一時期的特點。現在全國有二千三百個農業機器站，十五萬架曳引機在集體農塲工作，國家農塲現在有五千個以上。　　今年收成是一八八四年以來從未有個良好的現象。小麥，馬鈴薯，糖蘿蔔，玉蜀黍等農産物都非常豐稔。在烏克蘭，北高加索，伏爾加河流域，收獲量比一九三二年增加了二倍至二倍半。冬收還不在内。這是技術改進的結果。　　這是一九三三年蘇聯經濟的一點輪廓。國際廣播無線電臺美國失業綫上的人羣  羅倫　　××先生：這個舊日繁榮過的百老匯路，一月來更呈着冷淡了。一種將死的氣息，最會令人家摇頭。全個百老匯的店舖都好像洩了氣的橡皮囊，一地一天地縮小收入。但是夥計們就有空閑了　　昨天，砵地崙這小都市曾經有一次大騷動，而百老匯路就是騷動的中心。　　我們照例是十點鐘開市的。（我們的舖子是專件華工的生意，卽使有些下等的美國人來，不是賭鬼便是醉貓子，而這些人早晨都不上飯館的。）那知九點鐘左右，街面就吵閙得豈有此理，好像夜晚的一樣。我本來年輕，熱閙的事都愛瞧。那知一大隊失業工人的行列横在目前。　　這失業工人示威的行列中，給我曉得有多數的美國人五年内不會縫一件新衣，十天内不會進一塊麵包。我平日所見到的是一些中貧的美國人，爲了我們的種族關係而常有被打的危險，始終還不曾走進美國最貧的窮人屋裏考察道。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，打着平行綫以下的眼光斜視他人的脚跟，像怕我們外國人觀光一樣，但這些只限於婦人；男子漢都裸着胸，拿着長闊的標語，喊着短促的口號。　　標語和口號，多數是這樣的：［請政府維持工人的利益！］［請政府救濟失業工人！］［澈查停工的工廠！］［…………………］　　在表面上看來這都不是激烈的句語，但這已經驚動了砵地崙的資本家了。　　街旁都有着多少人看望。一個小都市裏平日在街中徘徊的都是失業工人，一旦大集合起來，二邊人行路就如死一般的寂靜，只留一抺巨流在街中間滾來滾去。　　十點鐘是過去了，人之巨流仍滾着來，兩旁的人行路仍是靜悄悄地！　　好像這就是暴風雨來臨的一樣，許多飯店，戲院，以及其他各色各樣的舖子誰都沒有閑着門。這百老匯路算是較爲繁華的一條街，戲院會抓盡了失業工人的錢，酒會頽唐工人的精神，女人會消瘦了工人的身體，一切的一切都是工人的墳墓。但如今這墳墓却在異樣的發動着。這應當使砵地崙怎樣的一個可怕啊！　　人都是聰明的，别的都市失業工人的示威巡行都是騷動的開始，搶奪行爲的預兆，於是店主人一定會聰明地閉閒門，拒絕暴徒的闖進，而我們的一少年中國］店舖也聰明地把門關起來了。　　這一行列是過去了。　　我躱進舖子裏，以爲事情是過去了在十點鐘左右罷，一聲巨雷似滾來一個狂潮，我正在二樓看着。　　失業工人的行列再從街東又走回來了，但這一次已是沒有組織的騷動。　　許多人喊着，許多人走着，許多人闖進人家舖子裏……在這兒，是雄壯的歌聲，急促的呐喊，混亂，無秩序地像無數的巨獸似的衝進戲院，飯店……　　我在那裏恐懼着，拦憟着。　　約莫過了幾分鐘的時光，大隊的警察就乘着汽車來了。一排槍［砰！砰！砰！……］的向着天空示威！　　驚察堆在失業工人的行列裏，槍都擱在他們的胸前，於是這班餓鬼有的搶到東西走，有的空手逃走，有的給警察抓着還在那裏高歌。街面已充滿了十分恐慌的狀態！　　過了許久許久，街面頓成死了的墳塲。只有警察在梭巡着。　　幾乎到了晚間才逐漸恢復原狀。丨丨我們的舖子還沒有被掠，大槪因爲他們的着眼點是在大商店裏。　　今天的報紙就寫上這些：　　［捕暴徒四十餘人；被擾商店佔百老匯十分之六。……］（羅倫於砵地崙［少年中國］館）‘小社會模型秘密避寒車  東海大爐間　　［烘！烘！烘！］的火。跳着，跳着。　　那扇小圓門兒一開，就把胖子的肥臉照得通紅的。烏黑的煤堆亦變成給血流遍了的小丘。鐵剷，鐵扞子……甚麽傢伙亦都在融融火光中活了起來！　　活了起來，從裝箱部竄來的小四子，王大榮，陰司鬼阿二，林寶……。那些凍僵了的胳膊，那些凍僵了的手，開始蟄動了，慢慢地從口袋裏拖出來，伸近大爐邊去，跑前幾步，……暖了，暖了……他們歡喜火，他們愛熱的火啊。　　［喂！林寶，你站出些望風，主任找來不是玩的。］王大榮抖抖肩膀說。　　［屁，呌我到門口去吃風，主任難道不是人。不覺得冷，我們活該給西北風刮死嗎？］林寶不高興地說　　小四子把左脚向煤上一扔：［倒霉的，那許多屋子寗可空着，給狗子拉尿，停汽車。媽的，汽車要屋子，人就不要屋子，把裝箱部弄在露天。］　　不錯，裝箱部在露天，上面祗蓋了一層馬口鐵，風一樣的刮進來，雨一樣的打進來，雪一樣的飄進來，在裏面工作着的人，誰不呌苦？不呌苦的，只有主任，他有玻璃屋子住，有回佣拿。電爐扮着笑呵呵的臉對着他，身子上有野獸的皮裘着……。究竟地位越高，生活越好，經理不是比主任要寫意嗎？牛奶　魚　　，鷄蛋　　　吃　了　　的補品。　　燒大爐的胖子把一剷一剷的煤儘向大爐的嘴裏丢進去。它就伸長了火舌一口一口地吞下，這傢伙的量眞大，像一輩子吃不飽似的，管子口冒着熱氣，胖子額上亦冒着熱氣。大家都羨慕着胖子，說他幹到這好缺兒，這大冷天，一天到晚靠火，衣褂薄點也不打緊。　　［胖大哥，你眞樂兒的。］　　　　　　　　　　　燒到深夜　　［烘房裏不是六點鐘就完工了嗎？］　　［燒水汀，　先生們房間裏的水汀。你們以爲咱老胖得了這好缺份，嘿嘿嘿嘿！一年到頭做烤𩿾哪。給火焰兒熏着，誰的嘴唇，皮膚有咱這樣乾煤的？幾十斤一剷煤要拿得起。六月裏熱得透不過氣。玻璃管理的水氣滴到身上就起泡。冷天，冷天亦不好呢！夜裏熄掉爐子往西北風裏衝，像把一塊正燒紅了的鐵突然往冷水裏浸。但，人可不是鐵，　　　　　　　　？虧得咱是個大胖子　　子，一些小毛病還　挨得下。［說着，把手裏的鐵剷往煤堆裏一扞，摇摇　　▲尙有重要文字轉入第五版請失業朋友注意　　茲徵求圖畫人材數人，須能作圖案文字，揷置，漫畫，有新思想者爲合格，如有上項人材，請將最近作品寄交四馬路五四八號樂華圖書公司。　　茲欲徵求練習生一位，年約十四五歲，願就者請繕寫毛筆小楷一紙，連同籍貫履歷投函南市萬裕碼頭街一八七弄五號古君收。　　茲擬聘請女敎師兼保姆一位，須北方人或能說流利之國語，體格强健，而無家庭牽累者爲合格，願就者請投函英工部局警務處姚振權收。　　某種國貨化妝品現需推銷員數位，須有一二元之保證，應徵者請於今明二日上午至赫德路嘉禾里四四號接洽。　　某小學欲請女敎員一位，敎授英文音樂圖畫等課，有意者請駕臨威海衛路永吉里六十八號接洽。　　某小報需廣告跑街數位及廣告部職員三人，願就者請詳細開明履歷年齡等，寄交南市萬裕街大吉里五號古英君收轉。　　茲欲聘請英文女敎授一位，須有高中以上畢業程度，能操流利英語，願就者請於每日上午九時至十二時惠臨法租界大世界後華格臬路十七號向吳君接洽。　　茲欲徵求能用英文講授國語之敎師一名，願就者請開明履歷及月薪數額函寄海格路六四二號陳馨轉。　　茲需圖書館執事人員一位，以具有中等中英文程度，在廿歲以上，三十以下爲合格，願就此職者請卽投函（或英文信）靜安寺路中華書局編輯所轉麥穗芳君收。　　茲欲聘請日文敎師一位，不拘性别，願就者，請開明履歷，投函法租界望志路永吉里六十六號周君轉。　　某家庭欲徵聘管理家事之女性一位，年齡籍貫不拘，以曾受敎育，而無家累者爲合格，願就者，請開明身世，投函法租界望志路永吉里六十六號周君轉　　某小學托聘敎員數位，敎授算術自然社會等課，願就者請詳細開明履歷及最低薪水，寄貝勒路八九一弄十四號謝君。　　某大工廠現欲聘玩具跑街數位，以能熟悉本審帮而有抖售經騐爲合格，願就者請開明履歷投函貝勒路底貝勒里夢　廠轉。</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei's Opening Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Wang Zhaoming of the Central Standing Committee delivered the following opening speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee on the 20th: "Fellow comrades, it has been a full year since the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee on December 3rd, 1932. Over this year, the national crisis has continued the trend since the September 18th Incident, becoming increasingly severe. Since March of last year, our troops have fought desperately around the Great Wall, enduring three months of bloody battles. At this time, the Communist bandits suddenly attempted to attack Nanchang, leading to the establishment of the North China Ceasefire Agreement in May. Since then, efforts have been focused on eliminating the Communist bandits, and by October and November, significant progress was made in Jiangxi. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others suddenly launched a rebellion in Fuzhou. In summary, the difficulties and dangers faced both externally and internally this year are too numerous to fully describe. It can be said that this is the most arduous period since our Party came to power, and also the most critical period in Chinese history.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the national crisis is due to the backwardness of China's politics, economy, military, culture, etc., in recent decades. This backward state cannot be reversed in a single day, and during this process, a national crisis may occur at any time. When our Party, in power, encounters such difficulties, on the one hand, it is undoubtedly responsible, but on the other hand, it is precisely because our Party is dedicated to the National Revolution, seeking China's freedom and equality, that the emerging forces, like newly sprouting seedlings, are subjected to the ravages of wind and rain. For the sake of China's freedom and equality, our Party can only do its best to preserve these seedlings, allowing them to develop amidst the storm.</p>
<p>As for the rise of the Communist bandits, it is the result of farmers' unemployment in Chinese history. Coupled with economic backwardness and rural collapse in recent decades, the number of unemployed people has increased dramatically, allowing ambitious individuals to manipulate them, seeking to do what Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong did. In Jiangxi Province alone, the population has decreased to six million. Such disasters are truly more severe than floods and wild beasts. In addition to striving to cure the symptoms by eliminating the Communist bandits, our Party must also strive to address the root causes by solving the problem of farmers' unemployment.</p>
<p>At a time when internal and external troubles are so severe, it is uncertain whether our Party comrades, through sincere unity and concerted efforts, can reverse the situation. However, Chen Mingjing, Li Jishen, and others, at this time, as members of the Central Committee of our Party, are engaged in actions that undermine our Party, and further undermine the Republic of China, which our Party has painstakingly built. This extraordinary rebellion adds another layer of heartbreak to our Party comrades on top of the internal and external troubles. However, the early end to the Fuzhou rebellion was due to the military comrades' valiant and loyal suppression of the rebellious elements, as well as the soldiers of the 19th Route Army's self-awareness that rebelling against the Party and destroying the country meant losing the courage to fight, leading to a rapid collapse. This shows that no matter how reputable an army may be on normal days, once it deviates from the Party's position, it cannot survive. This can be a comfort to our Party comrades.</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee opens today. Some of you comrades are originally working in Nanjing, while others are working in various regions. Now, we gather together to review the internal and external troubles of the past year, as well as the facts of our Party's efforts and struggles. At the same time, we will determine the direction of future work and all the rules of effort and struggle. Our common hope is that after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the internal and external troubles that are currently oppressing China can be resolved. The current situation in China is unsatisfactory. Not only are our Party comrades dissatisfied, but the entire nation is also dissatisfied. However, dissatisfaction is a driving force for progress. Because of dissatisfaction, we seek progress. We must not ignore the fact of dissatisfaction, and especially must not conceal the fact of dissatisfaction. We must find ways to make progress in order to compensate for all the unsatisfactory facts.</p>
<p>The historical mission of our Party is very important, the future that the Premier has directed us to strive for is very bright, and the unfinished work that the Premier has left for us is very complex and arduous. We must take twelve parts of courage to shoulder everything, and take twelve parts of humility to accept everything. On this day of the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I would like to encourage all comrades with the words 'humility and courage,' and wish for the future of the Party, and wish for the future of China."

<h3>Airplanes Scatter Leaflets Supporting the Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the end of the opening ceremony of the conference, the Aviation Administration dispatched training aircraft to fly in circles over the Central Party Headquarters and the high altitude of the capital city, scattering leaflets supporting the conference.

<h3>The Presidium will meet this morning.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Presidium of the Conference is scheduled to meet on the morning of the 21st to discuss the agenda and the list of members who will take turns chairing each session. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin is expected to be re-elected.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin of the National Government is due to submit his resignation to the Fourth Plenary Session as his two-year term has expired. However, the majority of CEC members believe that Mr. Lin should be re-elected. According to a certain CEC member, Chairman Lin is highly respected by all committee members for his age and virtue. However, the election process must still be followed in the meeting. (20th)</p>
<h3>The Guangdong proposal is expected to be passed.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The proposals of the CEC members from the Southwest have been revised several times and have been brought to Nanjing by Cui Guangxiu. The main points are: 1. Military personnel shall not interfere in politics; 2. During the military period, the military must be under the command of the government; 3. Freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. Cui has notified the Secretariat of the Central Standing Committee of the main contents. The attending committee members will conduct an informal discussion on the 21st. As for sending the original proposal to the Central Government for long-term consideration, the case concerning the balance of power between the central and local governments is proposed by Mr. Hu personally, which is the so-called second proposal from the Southwest. Judging from the external situation, the Southwest proposal can be passed by the Conference and handed over to the Central Standing Committee for handling. The extent and timing of its implementation in the future will depend on the actual situation. Therefore, the case will not be debated much at the meeting and will be unanimously agreed upon by the whole session. The words of CEC member Wu Jingheng are indeed meaningful. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke stated, "The proposal for reforming the political system and promoting political progress submitted by the Southwest committee members was drafted based on Hu Zhantang's eight proposals. I have not yet had the opportunity to see the full text, but it will be submitted to the Conference for discussion in the future. We deeply admire Mr. Hu's concern for the country, so the Central Government is expected to accept the principles advocated by Mr. Hu. However, the implementation methods still need to be carefully studied. I have no proposals for the Conference. The government organization will not be discussed at the plenary session, and there will be no changes." (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Zhihui stated, "The general proposal submitted by the Southwest committee members to the Conference is centered on Hu Hanmin's eight proposals. Hu's eight proposals are quite in line with the Central Government's proposals. If the Southwest proposal is indeed Hu's eight proposals, it is expected to gain the sympathy of the majority of CEC members. I believe that whether or not all proposals are passed by the Conference is not important. The fundamental problem lies in whether or not they are implemented. As Hu said, there are meetings but no discussions, and discussions but no implementation. The resolutions discussed at previous Central Conferences are all perfect, but very few are actually implemented." (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiao Yitang also has a proposal.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) CEC member Jiao Yitang proposed to the Conference to raise the status of traditional Chinese medicine. The content requests the rapid establishment of a Central National Medicine Institute, under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Proposal for implementing land policy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Qi stated that the proposal of the Central Civil Movement Committee to formulate opinions on the implementation of land policy and equalization of land rights has been submitted to the Conference. Its content is drafted in accordance with the Premier's teachings and with reference to the modern environment, with the aim of focusing on saving the rural areas and revitalizing the nation. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Peiping Cultural Groups Suggestion</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Peiping Federation of Cultural Groups telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session on the 20th, suggesting the establishment of a Central Cultural Committee to implement the cultural unification of the Three People's Principles, and to strictly crack down on reactionary cultural propaganda with government force. The original telegram stated, "In recent years, Chinese culture has been transformed and regressed. The so-called proletarian literature is popular, advocating class struggle and anesthetizing frivolous youth. This is truly a fundamental crisis for the nation and the state. If we want to save it, we must implement cultural unification with the Three People's Principles as the center. It is now proposed to establish a Central Cultural Committee, concentrate talents, and engage in compilation and translation, covering politics, economics, social sciences, philosophy, and even novels, dramas, paintings, and music, all within the scope of the Three People's Principles. Strictly crack down on reactionary products with government force, so that people's minds have a definite central belief, in order to establish the cultural foundation of the Three People's Principles. The future of the Party and the state will truly benefit from it." (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>He Chengjün claims he has no proposals.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) CEC member He Chengjün arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of the 20th and stated, "I usually focus on the principle of unity and follow the will of the people. I only seek practicality and do not make high-sounding statements. The common diseases of our country are that words do not match actions, actions do not match words, deceiving ourselves and others, and being jealous of each other, so that all policies cannot be developed. Now, the conference is being held in a time of multiple worries and hardships. I hope that all comrades can cooperate sincerely, correct their mistakes, and seek new progress. I came to Beijing in a hurry and have no proposals. In recent years, Hubei Province has suffered from natural disasters and bandit troubles. The people's suffering is truly greater than that of the provinces south of the Yangtze River. At this moment, the military campaign to suppress bandits in Hubei Province is making increasing progress. Except for a few small disturbances in western Hubei, it can be said that they have already been wiped out." (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang will arrive tomorrow.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain reporter asked Premier Wang at the Premier's Mausoleum on the afternoon of the 20th. The answers were as follows: 1. Chairman Chiang originally intended to fly to Beijing this morning to attend the meeting, but he was unable to depart due to important official business. The Central Government received a telegram from Chiang stating that he would fly to Beijing to attend the conference on the morning of the 22nd. 2. The proposals of the CEC members from the Southwest have not yet been delivered because Cui Guangxiu only arrived this afternoon. 3. The proposals for the conference are divided into five groups, which will hold separate meetings to review them at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. As for the content of the proposals, it is still unclear at the moment. (20th Hui Dispatch) (Nanjing) Chairman Chiang telegraphed Secretary-General Ye Chucang of the Central Government, stating that he would arrive in Beijing on the morning of the 22nd and asked him to inform all comrades.

<h3>Currency Wars and the Chinese Economy: A Note of Caution</h3>
<p>Since the United States abandoned the gold standard, although its domestic production and consumption have experienced some stimulation in the past six months, they have gradually shown signs of decline again by the end of last year. At the same time, all countries in the world are vigorously promoting their allied economies, striving to maximize the export of their own goods and minimize the import of foreign goods, which is the so-called economic self-sufficiency. The United States is being resisted by European countries across the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and Japan is competing with it in the Pacific Ocean to the west. Moreover, Britain and Japan were the first countries to abandon gold standard. Their foreign trade market has already established a considerable foundation. It is not easy for the United States to regain the economic advantage it had after World War I before 1926 in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the policy of buying cash failed to take effect, President Roosevelt resolutely reduced the pure gold content of the US dollar by 40%. The intention is as follows: First, based on the existing gold reserves of the United States (3.66 billion US dollars), the implementation of currency inflation can stimulate the excitement of the domestic industrial sector. In other words, it is to raise domestic prices. Second, on the other hand, since the pure gold content of the currency has been reduced, the external exchange rate of the US dollar will inevitably decrease. Therefore, the United States has obtained a more favorable and cheaper position in overseas markets. Whether in new or old markets, it has a competitive weapon. Third, in addition to the 11.2 billion US dollars of war debts owed to European countries by the United States, which are of a political nature and difficult to recover, there is also an investment of 17.5 billion US dollars, which belongs to industry and loans. Since 1929, they have also been gradually frozen and difficult to recover on schedule, because European countries are mostly suffering from economic panic, and South America is also feeling a great restraint. If the gold content of the US dollar is reduced, it may be easier to recover debts. The United States has begun to hope for an increase in intangible imports. Fourth, after the gold content of the US dollar is reduced, the price ratio of silver will inevitably increase. Therefore, exports to silver-using countries in the East can be increased as a result, and the Far East market may be in a more advantageous position.</p>
<p>Although Britain and several other countries are now trying their best to show calmness, believing that this move by the United States has no major impact on the world market, they can all calmly respond to it. However, in fact, before the United States abandoned the gold standard, Britain and Japan had already prepared to resist. The situation of currency wars has long been the same as that of tariff wars. However, tariffs increase tax rates, while currencies reduce currency values.</p>
<p>Our country is surrounded by powerful countries. Whether it is Britain, the United States, Japan, or other countries, they all regard us as the target of the Far East market. With the implementation of their currency inflation policies, the power of dumping will be even greater. What will we, a backward country with no practical preparations, do to suppress the influx of foreign goods, which exceeded 700 million yuan in the past year?</p>
<p>As an emergency measure, we must first strive to achieve a balance of international payments. In the past, when the economic panic had not been fully exposed, overseas Chinese could still contribute to their motherland with the rest of their hard-earned money, and the secret export of gold and silver was also enough to provide some supplementation. The investments of various countries in China in the past were the most rewarding way to compensate for the greatest economic losses suffered by our country. But now, the overseas Chinese economy is gradually declining, and gold and silver reserves have also been exhausted. Due to the global economic panic, it is also difficult to use foreign capital to develop industries. In the midst of this multitude of difficulties, we can only reluctantly seek ways to protect ourselves. 1. Encourage light industry and promote local goods. In today's international environment and domestic situation in our country, it may be possible to give full play to this without being subject to unexpected constraints. At the same time, if the government wants to immediately implement the control of import and export trade, it seems impossible. However, it is still not difficult to implement the management of foreign exchange reserves and the restriction of the consumption of non-essential foreign goods. The textile industry and other light industries should be given special political convenience, and then their development can be expected. Furthermore, the control of import and export trade will be smoother. 2. Guide the construction of heavy industry. Our current large cities only have the prototype of light industry, while small and medium-sized cities are still in a state of handicrafts. There is no chance of winning if we want to compete with other countries with this. Therefore, the revitalization of heavy industry is an endeavor that cannot be delayed. However, the establishment of heavy industry requires huge capital, and it must be the joint cooperation of private individuals and political forces.</p>
<p>Mussolini's Yellow Peril Theory</p>
<h3>Tokyo's Reaction</h3>
<p>Full of Anti-Japanese Air Impeding Diplomacy</p>
<p>Cable to the Ambassador to Italy to Protest Seriously</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Mussolini, as the head of a country and in the position of greatest responsibility, now disregards the long-standing friendly relations between Japan and Italy and publishes his anti-Japanese remarks in American newspapers. The Japanese Foreign Ministry attaches great importance to this issue. Foreign Minister Hirota issued a cable to Ambassador to Italy Matsushima on the 19th, ordering him to investigate the truth and lodge a serious protest with the Italian government. (20th Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Anti-Japanese Remarks</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) American newspapers on the 14th published a telegram from Rome containing Mussolini's remarks, the gist of which is as follows: Soviet Russia's Litvinov's speech in Moscow on December 19th served as a warning about the situation in the Far East, conveying the reality of a threat on the Siberian border. The danger of war between Japan and Russia not only has direct relevance to China and the United States, but also indirectly affects countries such as Britain, Italy, and the Netherlands. Japan is currently in a dangerous era of imperialism, with its industrial structure far surpassing that of Western civilized nations. Its people are full of a warlike spirit of sacrifice, and its military strength is also quite vigorous. Although China now appears to be easy prey for Japan's military might, in the near future, it could become a strong, unified nation. The fate of the white civilization's dominance in the Far East and the Pacific depends on how China develops over the next hundred years. We can imagine that the fusion of China and Japan in the future is not impossible, but who can guarantee that the alignment of the two countries will not be anti-European and anti-American? Although US-Russian consultations are a moral warning to Japan, they do not represent a US-Russian alliance to confront Japan. The Japanese people are currently facing heavy pressure from world opinion. We feel particularly threatened by the approach of Eastern peoples to the West. Today, the Yellow Peril theory is not as intense as it used to be, and while there is no political or military Yellow Peril, Japan's economic competition has reached the world market, forcing white Western countries to engage in political cooperation and mediate the conflict between Eastern and Western civilizations. (20th, Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Motives Not Hard to Guess</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the report of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's anti-Japanese statement, the Japanese Foreign Ministry immediately issued the following statement on the 19th: "We have not yet heard in what context Mussolini made the statement, but we can imagine his motivation. The Italian Embassy in Tokyo, due to the fact that Prime Minister Mussolini's speech at the Asian Scholars Conference held in Rome on the 22nd of last month was published in British newspapers, and the content was deliberately altered by the newspapers to create an anti-Japanese atmosphere, specifically issued a clarification of the key points of his speech in Tokyo newspapers on the 17th to clarify the truth. However, looking at the content of Mussolini's statement recently published in American newspapers, it is not difficult to guess where his true intentions lie. The Italian Prime Minister is greatly admired by the Japanese people, but now he is severely scolding a friendly nation for the sake of current international interests, which is deeply regrettable for Japan. The Japanese government plans to instruct its ambassador in Rome to call Prime Minister Mussolini's attention." (20th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>U.S. Statement on Far East Policy</p>
<h3>Japan Considers it Unfortunate</h3>
<p>Desire to Dominate East Asia</p>
<p>Island Nation Actually Being Despised</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 20th, saying that according to the content of the speech by Mr. Hornbeck, the Far East Director of the U.S. State Department, he is re-raising the Stimson Doctrine and extending the Monroe Doctrine attitude of the United States towards Central and South American countries to East Asia. At a time when Japanese diplomatic authorities are working hard to promote Japanese-American amity, if the content of Mr. Hornbeck's speech is indeed true, then it must be said to be an unfortunate matter. His idea deliberately disregards the existence of countries responsible for maintaining peace and order in the Far East. Japan hopes that the United States will not forget the fact that the Japanese people exist firmly in the Far East. (20th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Russia</p>
<h3>Speech on U.S.-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>Changes in the Far East Prompt Self-Defense</p>
<p>◎ Philadelphia U.S. Ambassador to Russia Bullitt gave a speech here today on U.S.-Russian relations, saying that the Soviet Union does not want to lightly initiate war except for self-defense. The Soviet Union sincerely wants to avoid war, but changes in Far Eastern affairs may make it necessary for it to take the path of self-defense. American businesses and industries that have trade relations with the Soviet government should pay attention to this fact. Bullitt also warned the business community not to expect the Soviet Union to buy large quantities of American goods, because if the U.S. does not buy more Russian goods, Russia will not be able to buy more American goods. According to reports, after the ambassador recently went to Russia to find a building for the U.S. Embassy, he returned to Washington to report on the situation to President Roosevelt and will return to his post soon.

<p>Japanese Magazine</p>
<h3>Propagandizing for War Against the U.S.</h3>
<p>Causing Great Stimulation to the American People</p>
<p>▲ New York News The New Year's issue of the Japanese magazine "Contemporary" contains an article by Lieutenant General Nobumasa Suetsugu, Commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, entitled "Preparations for War Against the U.S.," which vehemently attacks the U.S.'s active shipbuilding and encourages the Japanese people's animosity towards the U.S. Newspapers of the Hearst system here announced it in a sensational manner, causing extreme sharpening of the nerves of the American people. The American people are particularly attentive to what Lieutenant General Suetsugu said about the suspicion of Colonel Lindbergh's secret occupation. On the 13th of this month, newspapers of the Hearst system all carried a reckless and painful discussion by former Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee Britten, and published news that the Japanese authorities regarded the recent successful flight of the U.S. Navy's flight team in Honolulu as a major expansion of U.S. defense capabilities. Since the New Year's issue of the Japanese magazine "Hinode" was seized and confiscated by the Honolulu authorities after the appendix "Future Record of the Japanese-American War" was published, the American people have paid close attention to the words and deeds of the Japanese military authorities expressed in Japanese publications.</p>
<p>Also Tokyo News The Japanese naval authorities have decided to adopt an attitude of indifference to the fact that Lieutenant General Suetsugu's "Preparations for War Against the U.S." has caused stimulation among the American people, and will not make any clarifications or rebuttals.

<p>Regarding Puyi's Usurpation</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Issue Statement</h3>
<h3>Saying it is Different from the Qing Dynasty Restoration</h3>
<p>Puppet Organization Renamed Manchu Empire</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota issued the following statement regarding Puyi's enthronement: "The Manchu government persuaded Puyi to assume the throne and is preparing to implement the imperial system. This is a good thing for Manchuria, which has a deep relationship with Japan, to determine its national structure and strengthen its position as an independent country. The Japanese people cannot help but express their heartfelt congratulations." Furthermore, Land Minister Arakimoto's statement is as follows: "Manchuria is following the will of Heaven and preparing to implement the imperial system. This is a natural thing for Manchuria, which idealizes the politics of benevolent rule. The foundation of Manchuria can be strengthened by this. The Empire, which spares no effort to assist in ensuring peace in the Far East, feels deeply strengthened by this." (20th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A statement from foreign ministry authorities: The enthronement of Puyi this time is not a restoration of the Qing Dynasty, but is in accordance with the spirit of national construction. The existing national borders will not be changed, and the concerns about invading North China can also be dispelled. Manchuria's independence can be enhanced by Puyi's enthronement. The rumors of Japan annexing Manchuria can also be naturally eliminated. In the future, the internal policy will be to pacify the people in accordance with the will of Heaven, and the external policy will respect international faith and will not change the policy of international friendship. Therefore, the governance will be even better, and friendship with all countries will be enhanced. Japan is also deeply congratulated for this. (20th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<h3>Puppet State Premier Requests to Be Called Emperor</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Manchu" ambassador has now issued a notice, claiming that the "Manchu" Premier has this morning requested Puyi to be called Emperor. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Puyi has announced his willingness to ascend the throne as the Manchu Emperor. An official of the new government told a Reuters visitor that the new dynasty will not adopt the new era name Datong, but the government will henceforth be renamed the Great Manchu Empire. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Manchuria has indicated that the constitution of the new state, like Japan's, is a divinely ordained constitution. Therefore, the President of the Legislative Yuan, Zhao Xinbo, is currently drafting it in Tokyo. The announcement is scheduled for March 1, Datong year four. In addition, the decision to change the national name to "Great Manchu Empire" and the new era name will be made at a joint conference of the Senate and the State Council for joint discussion. (20th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<h3>Puyi to Inspect the Army and Navy</h3>
<p>(Changchun) After Puyi's enthronement, he will be the Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy, leading the entire army and navy. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold the first army parade at the Changchun airfield in late April after his enthronement. The participating units have been decided to be a newly formed national army division, a Jing'an army regiment, a regiment representing the garrisons from various places, a Xingan official army regiment representing the Mongolian army, and a regiment representing the central army. In addition, the naval review will have to wait until after the thaw and will be held on the Songhua River in early May. (20th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<h3>Puppet's Enthronement to Involve Suburban Sacrifices</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The ceremony for ascending the throne on March 1 will begin at 6 a.m. on that day with suburban sacrifices at the site of the palace being built in Shuntian Square. On that day, the new emperor will get up before dawn, fast and bathe, and then ride in a car with orchid crests, followed by honor guards and palace officials, to the place of worship from the newly renovated palace. Zheng Xiaoxu and other civil and military officials will greet him. The new emperor will hold a sacrificial ceremony at the Altar of Heaven in the south, and receive the national seal.

<p>French Newspapers' Alarming Words</p>
<h3>War Machine in the Far East is Ready to Launch</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Times commented on the situation in the Far East, saying that Japan is working hard to dominate the Asian continent. It is recklessly building a large empire uniting Manchuria and North China. Therefore, it wants to have Puyi ascend the throne in Beijing. The realization of this matter depends on the possibility of the recent international situation. Before this plan is implemented, the Soviet-Japanese issue must be resolved. A few months ago, the Soviet-Japanese clashes in Vladivostok and the coastal provinces were expected by many. However, since then, the conditions for this kind of conflict have changed greatly, namely, the resumption of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States on the one hand, and the rapid enhancement of the national defense of Vladivostok at the same time. Finally, the social and financial difficulties encountered by Japan have forced Japan's policy to adopt a waiting policy, hoping for the arrival of a good opportunity. The Times also said that the tragic crisis in the Far East is finally ready to launch. (19th, Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops in Eastern Chahar</p>
<h3>Still Have Plans to Invade</h3>

Feng said that the Japanese and puppet troops in Heihe, Eastern Chahar, have withdrawn to the original defense of Heihe, but they still have plans to invade, and the crisis is imminent. I am going to Tianjin to report on the recent situation in Chahar Province to Song. I can return in about two or three days, and then return to Zhang from Ping. (12th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) After the Eastern Chahar incident was stopped by the telegraph of the military officer Nemoto, the Japanese and puppet troops have now withdrawn to Heihe. Qin Dechun visited Shibayama the day before yesterday to negotiate. Nishi Yoshiichi, the commander of the 8th Division stationed in Chengde, sent a reply to the Japanese embassy, expressing two points: (1) The Longmensuo conflict was caused by a misunderstanding between the Heihe bandit suppression Mori unit and the Chahar army. (2) He declared that the Japanese army would never attack west of the Great Wall. The Chahar East issue is hoped to be discussed in Ping. Dechun has telegraphed Song Zheyuan on all the points expressed by Shibayama. Song instructed Qin to stay in Ping to handle the matter as appropriate due to waist pain. The Political Council has repeatedly received telegrams from the central government, intending to send personnel again to conduct practical negotiations with the Japanese side to avoid the recurrence of such incidents. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A visitor from Zhangjiakou said that the Japanese and puppet troops attacking Chahar are still outside Longmensuo and have not withdrawn. The rumor that they are withdrawing is a delaying tactic by the Japanese side. A Japanese invasion of Chahar will be realized sooner or later. The construction of the motor road from Guyuan via Longmensuo to Kangzhuang is currently underway. The 67th Army headquarters arrested Zhang Yongming, a traitor, on the evening of the 19th, for poisoning the water in Hexiwu, Anping Town, Bentang, Zhangjiawa and other villages in the defense area of ​​Yang Tuan and Cai Tuan, and confessed that they were bought by a certain party for 30 yuan per person, totaling more than 100 people. There are people going to all the garrisons in North China to poison the water. There are seven people in charge of poisoning the 67th Army's defense area. The poison powder is black and contains a large number of tuberculosis bacteria. People will be chronically poisoned after drinking the water. The military headquarters is searching for the remaining criminals. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>

The Japanese and puppet troops in the Malanyu area, the Japanese side has indicated that they can withdraw immediately, and our side is preparing. I originally planned to go to Yuguan with Tao Shangming, but I returned to Ping because the matter did not work out. The Hu Xie Wu unit of the Yutian Security Brigade mutinied, and the content is quite complicated. Chairman Yu sent me to be responsible for handling it. I will go to Yutian to investigate the truth of the mutiny of the unit within a few days to solve it, and then go to various counties for inspection. The problem of reorganizing transportation in the counties of this district has been formulated separately by each county. After the plans of each county are collected, we can properly plan the overall implementation plan. Tao Shangming has gone to Yuguan to conduct specific consultations with Iga on the Yuguan reception issue. The saying that Yuguan will be established as a city has become a thing of the past, and it has been decided to establish a special public security bureau to preside over everything in the locality. I will visit Huang Fu tomorrow to report. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops Invading Ningxia</h3>
<p>Crossing the Yellow River and Attacking Li Gangbao</p>
<p>Clash with Ma's Troops</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui Telegraphed Ping to Report Victory</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Chahar Provincial Committee, said that after the Japanese puppets seized Guyuan and Xifengzhai last month, they rushed to build military facilities such as airfields and motor roads there, and there were rumors that they were attempting to invade Longmensuo and Zhao Jiazhuang. It is said that the Japanese puppets are intensifying their large-scale invasion of a certain place. After investigation, the defense of our army's Zhang Renjie and other troops in the Chahar East area is extremely solid, and the public security is still quite stable. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Ma Hongkui telegraphed He Yingqin on the 19th, saying that the enemy who was defeated by Ma Guangzhong, the commander of our 2nd Regiment, at Yangjia and Wujia villages east of Li Gangbao on the evening of the 17th, collapsed to Jiangzhai and Chenzhai in the east. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment raided the villages to the east, cutting off the enemy's retreat. The enemy's main force headquarters came to the rescue late at night and was repelled. Before noon on the 18th, Ma, the commander of our 2nd Regiment, led his team to surround the village and bombard it with heavy mortars. The enemy broke through several times, but failed to succeed and was completely resolved by us. A total of Li Dianbin, the commander of the 4th Regiment of the enemy's 2nd Cavalry Division, Wang Panchen, the deputy commander of the regiment, Wu Zhenying, the commander of the 1st battalion, Xi Enbo, the deputy commander of the camp, Wang Kui, Wang Haisheng, Tu Zhenhai and other three company commanders, Li Wanqing and other five deputy company scribes, Bai Shaozhang, the commander of the 2nd battalion, Dong Liqing, Sun Zhenhai, Liu Zhuang, Li Shuyun, and seven deputy company commanders, 133 soldiers were captured, 242 rifles, 15 pistols, and more than 60 horses were seized, and more than 400 officers and soldiers were killed. According to the confession of the captured regiment commander Li Dianbin, the 2nd and 3rd cavalry divisions and the 1st and 2nd independent brigades of Sun's army who invaded Li Gangbao this time were all under the command of Army Commander Yu Shiming. They planned to cut off the connection between Pingluo, Ningxia, in order to advance and capture Pingluo. Unexpectedly, our army was severely attacked as soon as it engaged on the 17th. Army Commander Yu and Zhao Guozhen, the commander of the division, were both seriously injured, and the entire army collapsed. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) After the conflict between Sun's and Ma's troops in Shizuizi, the news obtained by the military side was that the situation had eased, but the 15th Route Army's office in Ping received a telegram from Ma Hongbin and Ma Hongkui this morning that the troops of both sides were still in contact. Because the natural dangers of Shizuizi were difficult to pass, Sun's army, in addition to leaving a part of its troops in the area to confront Ma's army, transferred a part of its troops across the Yellow River from Woye and clashed with Ma's army in Li Gangbao, intending to cut off the connection between Pingluo and Ningxia and attack Ningxia City directly. Currently, Ma Hongbin's troops are setting up defenses along the Great Wall south of Woye, and Lu Dachang's division is also linking up with Hu Zongnan's division, which is deployed from Yanchi to Ning'anbao and along Dalaichi, Jingyuan, and Gaolan, to prevent Sun's troops from entering Gansu. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xi'an) Deng Binshan flew from Lanzhou to Shaanxi by plane on the 18th to discuss issues with Shao Lizi and Yang Hucheng. They talked for three hours on the evening of the 18th. Deng said that Sun's troops' westward march has made the provinces in the Northwest quite uneasy. Fortunately, there have been no major conflicts in the past few days. The strength of Ma's troops is not inferior to that of Sun's army. The troops under his command are 8,000, stationed in Lanzhou and Qingning to defend. It has not yet been decided whether to go to Beijing and Jiangxi to report to the central government and to ask Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. However, he hopes that the central government will have appropriate arrangements as soon as possible. (20th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Tan Keming, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Qinghai Province, came to Shaanxi with Deng Binshan on the 18th and said that this trip was for discussing issues. He may go to Beijing and Jiangxi to report and ask for instructions separately. Currently, Sun's troops' westward march has made the people of Qinghai quite uneasy, but the order in Qinghai is extremely peaceful. Zhu Shaoliang is not going to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session in order to deal with this serious situation. (20th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Economic Committee</p>
<h3>Preparing to Convene a Standing Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Formulating a One-Year Construction Plan</p>
<p>To Be Implemented Step by Step After Approval</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen said that the convening of the Standing Committee of the Economic Committee has been scheduled to be held during the Fourth Plenary Session. Except for Chiang, who has not yet arrived in Nanjing, Wang, Sun, Kong, and I are all in Nanjing. After Chiang arrives in Nanjing next Monday or Tuesday, the date will be set. As for the date of convening the plenary meeting, it must be decided when it is proposed at the Standing Committee. In addition, the Economic Committee plans to formulate a one-year construction plan, which will be implemented step by step after being submitted to the Standing Committee for approval. I plan to go to Shanghai to handle committee affairs after the Fourth Plenary Session closes. Someone asked what he thought of the Fourth Plenary Session and whether the Fourth Plenary Session would discuss issues such as political reform. Song replied that he did not know, only saying that he had no proposals for the Fourth Plenary Session. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen the 20th. Regarding the Fourth Plenary Session, I have no proposals. I only report on the matters related to the visit to Europe and the United States last year. (1) The cotton and wheat loan process. When I was in the United States, it was the most critical period for our country. The Japanese army was approaching Pingjin, the financial situation was in desperate straits, the angry bonds fell to the lowest price, and the financial situation was stagnant. The loan was completed at this time. Although our country suffered setbacks, the US government still expressed trust and goodwill to our government. This is the greatest effect of the loan's establishment. After the loan was established, domestic public bonds soared as a result, and the exchange suspended trading twice, rising more than 10 yuan. The market felt excited, and the financial situation was stabilized as a result. As for the US cotton part of the loan, due to the bumper cotton harvest in China this year and the drop in yarn prices, US cotton has not been sold well. The outside world does not know the truth and thinks that the government will inevitably lose money by purchasing and selling US cotton. In fact, there is not only no loss, but also a surplus. This year, there is even a trend of increased sales. As for the US wheat flour part of the loan, the reason why it could not be sold before was to wait until the domestic wheat was sold out before selling US wheat, so as not to affect the country's agricultural products. Now that the domestic products have been sold out, the US wheat is coming, and it can be sold off immediately. Because the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspended the collection of import duties, Minister Kong is currently consulting with various manufacturers on the sale of US wheat flour, and there is an overall plan. It is believed that the above-mentioned cotton and wheat can be completely sold in the future. According to the past price of wheat flour, the sales are very smooth before tariffs are added and there is a guarantee that it can be sold out in six months. According to the world market price, the US wheat market price is 30% to 40% lower. However, because the US government subsidizes all the wheat prices in this loan, the market price of the wheat purchased by our government under the loan is only 10% lower than the world market price. Calculated over a five-year period, the price of this US wheat is only 2% higher than the world market price per year. The interest on this loan is only 5%, and with the addition of the annual loss of 2%, the total annual interest is only 7%. Therefore, the government will never lose money. According to the forecast of the person in charge of economic sales, the government can get a figure of 50 million yuan this year under the loan, excluding principal and interest payments. As for the uses, except for a small part for building roads and other operating expenses of the Economic Committee, the rest has not yet been used. It will be decided after the various construction plans currently being formulated by the Economic Committee have been reviewed and approved by the Standing Committee. (2) The process of Italy returning the Boxer indemnity. The case has been pending for ten years. When I went to Europe last year, I contacted and negotiated with the Italian government, and telegraphed to the government. With the permission of the two standing members Wang and Chiang, I signed an agreement with the Italian Finance Minister, Rong, to return the Gengkuan. It was resolved when the signing happened in London. The Ministry of Finance recently borrowed 44 million yuan from various banks, which is used as a mortgage fund for this amount. In addition to the above report, I have no proposals for the Fourth Plenary Session. The five standing members of the Economic Committee usually cannot gather together to discuss and resolve everything due to their official duties. Therefore, the direction of progress can only be planned, but cannot be implemented, and the committee's affairs cannot help but be suspended. This time, we were able to gather together and work together. I hope that all plans can be discussed and decided, so that they can be carried out in a practical manner. (19th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Silk Industry Control Association of the Economic Committee believes that with the silkworm flooding approaching, it is necessary to establish it. Preparations may be made next month. The association's address will be in Hangzhou, and an office will be set up in Shanghai for the convenience of handling affairs. The candidate for the director of the association is tentatively planned to be Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Department of Construction of Zhejiang Province, and the deputy director is tentatively planned to be Tan Xihong.

<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<h3>Flew to Hangzhou Today and Transferred to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's luggage, guard vehicles, etc. were transported to the Kyoto-Hangzhou National Highway this morning. The Fokker aircraft is still parked at the Zhizhi Bridge Airport. Because no telegrams have been received from the front (Jian'ou), it has not yet flown to welcome Chiang. Representatives of various agencies, Chiang Guotao, etc., waited at the airport until 3:30 p.m., but he still did not come to Hangzhou. According to Chiang Jianren, the Director of the Political Training Department of the Aviation School, Chairman Chiang will not be able to come here today, and it is expected that he will fly to Hangzhou on the 21st and transfer to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. Last night's stay at the Aviation School is definitely not true. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek decided to return to Nanjing to attend the plenary session. In recent days, various parties have repeatedly gone to the airport to wait in vain and return. The Military Affairs Committee said at noon on the 20th that Chiang would arrive in Nanjing at 5 o'clock. President Wang and important figures such as Tang Shengzhi and Zhou Yawei and representatives of various agencies went to welcome him. Then, the Lishi Society received a phone call that Chiang would not return today and notified the welcoming staff to disperse. Chiang went to the front line to supervise the battle and suppress the rebellion immediately after Chen and Li rebelled. Yesterday, he also went to □□ for inspection. Chiang will return to Nanjing by plane on the 22nd. (20th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>German Reply Delivered to France</p>
<h3>Stalemated Disarmament Negotiations</h3>
<p>French Proposals Overturned</p>
<p>Hope for Continued Exchange of Views</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany has sent its reply to the French disarmament memorandum, which was previously submitted to Germany, to the French Ambassador in Berlin, Mr. Poncet, today, asking him to forward it to Paris. The document is fifteen pages long and states that the disarmament verification period is aimed at discriminating against Germany, and opposes the division of disarmament into two stages. It also states that Germany's 200,000 troops are insufficient to guarantee national security. The reply goes on to state that the German government is willing to resolve the issue of weapons and troop numbers simultaneously, and that the international supervision of so-called "military organizations" in Germany should also be applied to similar organizations in other countries. The document concludes by welcoming France's proposal to reduce its air force by 50%, but states that this proposal is meaningless if Germany is not allowed to have an air force. At the same time, the German newspapers have expressed extreme disappointment with the speech given by French Prime Minister Doumergue in the Senate yesterday, saying that Doumergue's statement that "negotiations between Paris and Berlin are illusory" does not help to improve relations between Germany and France. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, German Foreign Minister Neurath met with French Ambassador Poncet and personally handed over the German government's reply to the disarmament memorandum that France sent to Prime Minister Hitler on January 1st. Although no information about the content of the German reply has been released, the Associated Press representative has learned from reliable sources that the tone of the reply is quite mild, and states that the exchange of views that has already begun should be continued in the future in order to promote mutual understanding. After Ambassador Poncet left, Foreign Minister Neurath met with the British Ambassador and personally delivered the reply to the British government's memorandum, which was delivered to the German government on December 20th of last year. The content of the reply is the same as that sent to France. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Simon Returns to London</h3>

<p>No Date Set for Resumption of Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon's sudden return to London has attracted great attention here. According to well-informed sources, Simon urgently wants to return to London to discuss the contents of the German reply with his colleagues because Germany has already replied to the French disarmament memorandum.

<p>(Geneva) The leading members of the Disarmament Conference decided today to meet again in London on February 13th. If the major powers want to postpone the meeting again, a plenary session of the leading members will be convened on February 16th. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, has decided to consult with Disarmament Conference personnel in London on February 13th to decide on the date of the next meeting. He has notified French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour of this situation, and the latter has agreed. According to Henderson's interview with the Associated Press reporter, Disarmament Conference personnel will determine the date in February based on the current situation. However, according to the opinion of general observers, the Disarmament Conference will not be held before the end of February or the beginning of March. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Drafted by the League of Nations</p>
<h3>Declaration on the Saar Question</h3>
<p>The Administrative Council Concludes After an Open and Stiff Discussion</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations decided today not to discuss the Saar issue in an open forum. Therefore, the Chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, Mr. Knox, and the important representatives attending the League of Nations conducted secret meetings. It is reported that French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour suggested issuing a declaration stating that the League of Nations will monitor the Saar people to ensure they receive appropriate treatment and protect their complete freedom to vote in the 1935 plebiscite to decide whether the Saar should be returned to Germany, become part of France, or remain under the administration of the League of Nations. Paul-Boncour's proposal was widely supported. A public meeting will be held tomorrow to discuss this matter. Today, the Administrative Council passed the subcommittee's report on the resettlement of Assyrian Christians from northern Iraq to Brazil in South America, and promulgated regulations on the procedures for the Committee of Experts to deal with slavery issues. The current session of the Administrative Council will end tomorrow. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations held a closed-door meeting at 4 p.m. Some national representatives requested that the Saar issue not be raised at the public meeting today, but be discussed at a secret meeting of the Administrative Council in the evening. Britain took this position. In the evening, the Administrative Council held a meeting to review the Saar issue, which lasted for two hours. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour said that his agreement to hold a secret meeting was conditional on the Administrative Council taking a decision at the public meeting and bearing responsibility for it. This public meeting will likely be held tomorrow. Paul-Boncour wants the people and public opinion in the Saar region to understand this. It is believed that the public opinion of certain countries should not be allowed to clash with each other, and that the publication of the declaration by the Chairman of the Saar Administrative Commission, Mr. Knox, would undermine the position of the Administrative Commission. At the meeting, Knox explained the situation in the Saar in detail. After the explanation, opinions were exchanged. Paul-Boncour said that the Administrative Council should give instructions to the committee responsible for preparing the Saar plebiscite and should declare that the Saar people will not be abandoned by the League of Nations under any circumstances. Paul-Boncour finally proposed that in addition to the report submitted by the committee, the Administrative Council should also issue a declaration as needed. This proposal was slightly opposed only by British Foreign Secretary Simon, but it was finally decided to draft a declaration immediately in preparation for submission tomorrow. If the declaration is approved by all, this issue will be considered resolved before May of next year. The Secretariat of the League of Nations then issued a press release, stating that the Administrative Council of the League of Nations had today, in the presence of the Chairman of the Saar Administrative Commission, Mr. Knox, and with his cooperation, exchanged views on the "preparations for holding a plebiscite in the Saar region." The Administrative Council is scheduled to hold a public meeting at 4 p.m. today. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Speech by the French Prime Minister</p>
<h3>Germany Expresses Disappointment</h3>
<p>Says it will cause extreme panic in Europe</p>
<p>(Berlin) The international diplomatic speech given by French Prime Minister Doumergue in the Senate has apparently failed to arouse any sympathy in German public opinion. According to the Nazi Party newspaper Völkischer Beobachter, the tone of the French Prime Minister will cause extreme panic in Europe, and European culture will once again see new developments in French military policy. Therefore, the newspaper hopes that Doumergue's remarks were only made for domestic consumption. Furthermore, the German general press expressed disapproval of Doumergue's statement that direct negotiations between Germany and France were ineffective because the matters negotiated between the two countries were also of deep concern to other countries. The newspaper stated that even the most foolish people know that this is not the case, but if the French government insists on its firm and unyielding attitude and uses inferior propaganda policies to undermine everything, then direct negotiations will certainly be difficult to achieve anything.

<p>Italy Promises</p>
<h3>To Genuinely Assist Austrian Independence</h3>
<p>Austro-Hungarian Merger is Also Possible</p>
<p>Demands Germany Cease Interference</p>
<p>◎ Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has obtained a genuine promise of assistance from Italy. Otherwise, Dollfuss would not have publicly declared yesterday that Austria has run out of patience with the activities of the Nazi Party. Germany has been smuggling bomb-making materials into Austria. Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich is currently in Vienna and has discussed everything with the Austrian Chancellor. When asked about this issue today, Suvich replied that Austrian peace is of utmost importance, and only after peace can other matters be discussed. Suvich also mentioned Mussolini's plan for Austria. It is said that Italy will support the merger of Austria-Hungary. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to well-informed sources, the Austrian envoy to Berlin, Mr. Tauchiz, called on German Foreign Minister Neurath on Wednesday. During the conversation, the Austrian envoy requested that Germany issue a declaration explicitly recognizing Austrian independence and stating that it would no longer interfere in Austrian internal affairs. The Austrian envoy also said that if Germany could not provide a satisfactory response on this matter, Austria would seek redress from the League of Nations. It is reported that Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss delivered a speech on the 18th of this month, stating that Austria has run out of patience and is determined to restore order with all its strength. This shows that the Austrian envoy's request to the German Foreign Ministry is not without reason. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>◎ Hungarian Finance Minister Imrédy recently returned to Budapest from Geneva. He stopped in Vienna en route. According to some sources, Imrédy judged from an observer's perspective. It is also reported that a German delegation led by Volkart, Director of the Commercial Department of the German Foreign Ministry, is conducting commercial negotiations with the Hungarian government. However, the situation of the talks is being kept strictly secret and no press releases have been issued. The newspapers are taking an absolutely reserved attitude towards this matter. According to economic sources, difficulties have arisen in the German-Hungarian negotiations regarding the export prices of Hungarian agricultural products. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>British-American Exchange Rate Coordination</h3>
<p>American Officials Unable to Confirm</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Plan Expected to Pass Congress</p>
<p>(London) The New York Commercial Bulletin reports that the central banks of Britain and the United States have agreed to set the exchange rate at five US dollars to one British pound, and have mutually agreed to use exchange rate adjustment funds to maintain this ratio. Officials here have denied this, saying that the United States may try to curb the rise and fall of the US dollar for the benefit of a certain period, but has not reached a compromise with Britain to make this curb permanent. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Stock Exchange Gazette, the mouthpiece of the London financial community, published an article interpreting President Roosevelt's message explaining his monetary policy, saying that it was a sign of the United States returning to orthodox monetary policy. "President Roosevelt wants to approach the goal of monetary stability by devaluing the currency. Roosevelt intends to renegotiate with Britain in order to establish a new exchange rate adjustment fund. His intention is to advocate a coordinated policy rather than to use this negotiation as a tool for struggle." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The government notified Congress that President Roosevelt's monetary policy, which includes the receipt of gold reserves from the Federal Reserve Banks and the establishment of an exchange rate adjustment fund, will be implemented soon. Therefore, Congress should pass the monetary plan submitted by the President before next Tuesday. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Mexican President</p>
<h3>Approves Silver Agreement</h3>
<p>◎ Mexico City The Mexican President signed the London Silver Agreement today. The main purpose of the agreement is to reduce fluctuations in the price of silver. The parties to the agreement are the silver-using countries of India, China, and Spain, and the silver-producing countries of Canada, Mexico, the United States, Australia, and Peru. The agreement stipulates that the Indian government will sell a maximum of 140 million ounces of silver within four years from January 1934, with an average annual sale of 35 million ounces. If the amount sold in any year is less than 35 million ounces, the remainder can be carried over to the following year, but the amount sold each year cannot exceed 50 million ounces. The Indian government has the right to sell its silver to any national government that is willing to repay the United States war debt in silver. If India sells a total of 175 million ounces of silver in four years under these terms, the agreement will automatically expire. Spain's obligations are the same as India's. Spain can sell 30 million ounces in four years. China will not sell or destroy silver dollars during these four years to obtain silver. Mexico, Canada, the United States, Australia, and Peru will not sell silver during these four years and will purchase 35 million ounces of mined silver from the market each year. The amount to be allocated among the five countries shall be determined by the governments of the five countries. The purchased silver must be used as currency or kept unsold. The agreement is only valid after it has been ratified by the governments of the countries concerned. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>French Politicians Use Scam</p>
<h3>To Stir Up Political Storm</h3>
<p>Two Brawls in the House of Representatives</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour Forcefully Defends Himself</p>
<p>(Paris) The two brawls and the imminent duels in the House of Representatives related to the Stavisky giant scam now involve French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. It is reported that Congressman Henriot said a few days ago that Education Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour were both related to Stavisky's wife, Arlette Simon. Now, Paul-Boncour, who is in Geneva, has learned of this and has asked Prime Minister Doumergue or other cabinet members to issue a statement on his behalf during the congressional debate. According to Paul-Boncour, Mrs. Arlette is the niece of an old friend of his, and also the daughter of a colleague in his army, who died on the battlefield during the European War. In 1926, Arlette was accused of being involved in a theft case. At that time, Arlette was resting in the hospital due to illness. Daladier and Paul-Boncour visited the girl in the hospital and then hired Daladier and Paul-Boncour as her defense lawyers. Now, Congressman Henriot claims that Mrs. Arlette and Stavisky are one and the same, and that the so-called theft gang is actually led by Stavisky. Daladier immediately rebuked Henriot as a shameless liar, thus leading to the duel case. Now, the newspaper related to former Prime Minister Herriot has published an editorial demanding that all criminals related to the Stavisky case be punished severely according to the laws of the country. However, at the same time, immoral politicians are using this case to stir up political storms and slander political opponents for their own selfish purposes, and they should also be held liable in reverse. This is the only way to be fair. Paul-Boncour also said in his initial statement to Doumergue that when he accepted Arlette's position as defense lawyer, he had not yet heard of Stavisky's name and had not yet met him, because Stavisky had not yet been noticed by society at that time.

<p>Inner Mongolia Autonomy Measures</p>
<h3>Will be Submitted to the Fourth Plenary Session for Discussion</h3>
<p>Mongolian Representatives Have Agreed Not to Leave Beijing for the Time Being</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Central Government passed the Inner Mongolia Autonomy Measures, representatives of the Mongolian Leagues and Banners stated their case to the Executive Yuan and ministries, but failed to be accepted. Central Committee members Chen Lifu and others, believing that the Mongolian side's dissatisfaction with the Inner Mongolia autonomy was a whole issue, advocated submitting it to the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion and decision to show solemnity. It has now been decided to submit it to the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion. The representatives were originally scheduled to return to Mongolia within days to report, but the two presidents, Wang and Dai, believing that the Plenary Session had already opened and a decision was expected soon, asked them to postpone their return north. The representatives have agreed not to leave Beijing for the time being. Shi Qingyang will host another banquet for the Mongolian representatives at Huanhuachun on the 20th. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mongolian representatives paid a visit to Yu Youren at 3 pm on the 20th to state their views on organizing an autonomous regional government. Shi Qingyang invited Zhao Taibao and others to exchange views for a long time at 5 pm. (Central News Agency Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A preparatory committee member of the Mongolian Fellow-Provincials Association in Beiping talked about the eleven measures agreed upon by Huang Shaoxiong in Bailingmiao. The main points can be divided into five categories: (1) The autonomous regional government is directly under the Central Government; (2) The autonomous regional government has equal powers to the provincial government; (3) In areas where the provincial government has not established tax collection agencies, taxes are collected by the autonomous region; (4) The expenses of the autonomous regional government can be supplemented by tax revenue, and if it is insufficient, it will be subsidized by the central government. It is regrettable that the plan passed by the Central Political Conference does not follow the established principles at all. The representatives stationed in Beijing are now fighting for it. It is difficult to predict the outcome, but it is believed that Huang will insist on his position. The Fellow-Provincials Association in Beiping will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss countermeasures. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Fellow-Provincials Associations in Beiping and Chahar telegraphed the Central Government, requesting that the Mongolian autonomy measures still be submitted for approval according to the principles approved by Huang Shaoxiong in Bailingmiao, and telegraphed the representatives in Beijing, saying that the articles of the autonomous regional government reported in the newspapers have changed the region and reduced the scope of authority. It seems that this kind of self-weakening system is impossible to accept. All of you representatives have heavy responsibilities, and please strive to persuade each article based on the principles approved by Minister Huang to meet the environmental trends. If there is no sincere assistance, it is hoped that all members will return quickly. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Measures by the Public Safety Bureau</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Provincial Government passed measures on the 19th for reorganizing the public safety bureaus of various counties, including their monthly expenditures and police strength. They are divided into three classes. The first-class bureaus have monthly expenditures of over 7,000 yuan and a police force of over 500, including the five counties of Wuxian, Wuxi, Nantong, Jiangdu, and Tongshan. Second-class bureaus have expenditures of 4,500 yuan and a police force of over 360, including the seven counties of Changshu, Danyang, Wujin, Wujiang, Songjiang, Rugao, and Taixian. Third-class bureaus have expenditures of 2,000 yuan and a police force of 120, including the twenty counties of Yixing, Jiangyin, Kunshan, Qingpu, Shanghai, Nanhui, Haimen, Taixing, Funing, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Peixian, Liyang, Jinshan, Fengxian, Jiading, Taicang, Dongtai, Jingjiang, and Suqian. The remaining twenty-seven counties, such as Yangzhong, with expenditures under 2,000 yuan and a police force under 120, will have their bureaus abolished and merged into sections. The expenses will be centrally collected and disbursed by the county government, limited to special funds collected with the land tax and other sources approved by the police donations without being overly harsh. The Public Safety Bureau is not allowed to directly collect fees. The Public Safety Bureau can only directly issue public announcements regarding the suppression of illegal activities; all other matters are handled by the county government. First-class bureaus have three sections and one inspection office, second-class bureaus have two sections and one inspector, and third-class bureaus have no sections but have bureau staff and inspectors. In counties where bureaus are abolished, the first section of the county government has a police affairs section staff member and an inspector. It is also stipulated that each sub-bureau has a police force of 40, a branch station has 20, and a police post has 12. In county seats and commercial districts, the police adopt a combination of watch and patrol system. Branch stations in remote areas or large jurisdictions adopt a mobile patrol system and do not have fixed posts. (Central News Agency telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government to Request Subsidies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lu Dipin, the Chairman of Zhejiang Province, attended the Plenary Session in Nanjing. His secretary, Xu Changwei, said that Zhejiang Province's various constructions in recent years have placed an extraordinary strain on the provincial treasury. For example, the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was entirely funded by the provincial government without raising debts or borrowing money. Currently, the annual revenue is about 20 million yuan, while expenditures are over 21 million yuan, resulting in an annual shortfall of several hundred thousand yuan. Chairman Lu's trip to Nanjing, in addition to attending the Fourth Plenary Session, is also intended to take the opportunity to explain the difficult situation to President Wang and request appropriate monthly subsidies to allow various projects to be implemented.

<h3>Daqing Railway Plans to Extend the Route</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fan Yisui, a member of the Central Committee and Director of the Daqing Railway Bureau, arrived in Nanjing from Jiaozuo and said that there are not many cities along the line from Qinghua to Daokou, and passenger traffic is very low. However, the coal transportation business is good, with monthly revenue of about 150,000 yuan. After deducting expenses of 120,000 to 130,000 yuan, there is a monthly surplus of 20,000 yuan. All surplus is deposited in the Central Bank, so the company recently repaid the Fuk Company loan once, totaling 200,000 yuan. Now, to develop the railway business, there are plans to extend the route to Daming in Hebei to allow the surplus coal from Henan Province to be circulated to coal-deficient areas, which can also increase passenger traffic. If this can be achieved, the benefits will be great. This case has already been approved by the Ministry of Railways. Regarding the construction costs, it has not yet been decided whether to continue borrowing from the Fuk Company or to allocate funds from the Central Government. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

The Sumioka couple met with each person to investigate their appearance, physique, identity, and other conditions. They selected ten people and sent their photos to the prince last October for evaluation. According to a telegram received on the 19th, the prince selected Masako Kuroda (23 years old), the second daughter of Viscount Kuroda, as the first candidate, and Shigeruko Moji Tada (22 years old) as the second candidate. The prince will come to Japan soon to meet the two women and decide on his wife. It is said that the prince is 22 years old this year, believes in Christianity, and has stated that he will strictly adhere to the one-man-one-woman system. (Japanese Allied Telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3>After the 19th Route Army Withdrew from Fuzhou</h3>
<p>The Central Army Entered the City Only on the 16th</p>
<p>Personnel of the Puppet Government Fled in Disarray</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army on the Southern Fujian Front</p>
<p>Guangdong's Measures Regarding the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen states that after the 19th Route Army withdrew from Fuzhou, its forces in the areas of Baisha, Dahu, and Luoyuan, totaling nearly 30,000, crossed the river via pontoon bridges at Fashan Bridge, Xiadou, and Baisha. They completely withdrew by the night of the 15th. The covering troops also left the city on the morning of the 16th. At 1 p.m., two regiments of the Central Army under Jiang Dingwen arrived, and Fuzhou was completely recovered. Earlier, the 19th Route Army had built new-style fortifications in Baisha and the nearby suburbs, which were indeed extremely solid. However, the Central Air Force bombed them heavily and accurately, destroying most of the fortifications. At the same time, a bomb was dropped near the Xin'gang electric light factory but did not explode. The front-line power grid had already taken effect. After the loss of Gutian, Cai Tingkai knew that the suburbs could not be defended and that if the Central Army from Gutian and Shuikou pursued, they might not be able to retreat calmly. Therefore, he decided to abandon Fuzhou.</p>
<p>With the defeat of the 19th Route Army, the People's Government was destroyed. The Haiyang Wheel, which sailed to Hong Kong on the 14th, carried passengers including Chen Youren, Xu Qian, Wang Lixi, Hu Qiuyuan, Lin Zhifu, and officials from various committees of the Literary and Economic Council. The Japanese ship Dalin Maru, which sailed to Hong Kong on the same day, carried passengers including Xu Xiqing, Liu Zhiyan, and officials of all ranks from the Ministry of Finance and the People's Government. The two ships carried over 1,500 family members of the People's Government personnel, all fleeing in disarray. Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen flew to Quanzhou by plane on the afternoon of the 13th. Cai Tingkai flew to Quanzhou on the 13th to make arrangements, and returned to the province on the 14th to command the retreating troops. He flew to Quanzhou again on the morning of the 16th. Jiang Guangnai and Zhang Yan took a car directly to Quanzhou after all the troops had retreated, arriving in Zhangzhou on the evening of the 16th. The retreating troops were divided into</p>
<p>two routes. One route entered Datian, Dehua, and Yongchun via Yongtai to guard against a flanking attack by Lu Xingbang, who was stationed in Youqing and Yong'an. The other route retreated from Fuqing to Putian. The front line of these two routes was in Yongtai and Fuqing, with the main defense line in Putian, Xianyou, and Dehua. The First Army under Shen Guanghan and the Third Military Region under Qu Shounian, totaling about 12,000 men, defended against the Central Army's southward advance from Fuzhou and Shuikou. The entire Second Army under Mao Weisou was stationed in the Quanzhou region, including Hui'an, Nan'an, Jinjiang, Anqing, and Tong'an, and formed the main force of the 19th Route Army. The Fourth Army under Zhang Yan, which crossed the river last, will go to Dehua, Yongchun, and Anqing and return to Zhangzhou. Xu Minghong and Yu Huamu served as political and military officials respectively. Fu Bocui was still appointed as the commander of the Sixth Army. Li Chong, the former brigade commander of Zang Zhiping's unit, was appointed as the commander of the supplementary division, planning to recruit the volunteer corps from the west gate and the bandits from Zhangzhou to maintain the defense. However, the Central Government has now sent Du Qiyun, a special military commissioner, to Xiamen to recruit the people's army, and Rui Lin of the Southern Fujian Suppression Office, and Xu Ruilin, the commander of the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou people's army stockade suppression militia, most of the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou people's army bandits were recruited by Du, Yang, Xu, and others. Very few attached themselves to the 19th Route Army. Zhang Wuyu of the Fourth Detachment of Yang Fengnian's unit has recovered Zhao'an, Yunxiao, Dongshan, and Zhangpu counties. Du Qiyun's plainclothes team and Wu Ci's unit have recovered Fugong. The 19th Route Army in Zhangzhou, originally stationed with one regiment and two artillery battalions, and after the withdrawal from Fuzhou, added eight battalions between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Therefore, before the Central Army attacked southern Fujian, the people's army did not dare to attack Zhangzhou. The old unit of Chen Guohui in Quanzhou is now under the command of Yang Fengnian, but it does not dare to move while the 19th Route Army firmly defends Xingquan. These miscellaneous troops will only assist in guerrilla warfare when the main force attacks.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Army's entry into Fujian is still on the Guangdong border, with the vanguard just entering Yongding and Shanghang. Chen Jitang will send representatives to Zhangzhou to discuss the aftermath of the 19th Route Army. It is rumored that his measures are: 1) Chen, Li, Jiang, and Cai resign, preserving the name of the 19th Route Army. A slight reorganization is made internally, and the leadership is changed. 2) Divide Xingquan Yong and the Jiulong River as the boundary. The counties of Tong'an, Anqing, Yongchun, Quanzhou, Nan'an, Hua'an, and Hui'an on the southeast bank are the defense areas of the 19th Route Army. The counties of Zhanglong on the west of the Jiulong River, including Longxi, Nanqing, Zhangpu, Pinghe, Zhao'an, Yunxiao, Longyan, Yongding, and Shanghang, are the defense areas of the Guangdong Army. However, whether Cai Tingkai is willing to resign, the selection of a successor, and the biggest problem of military pay are not easy to solve. Whether Guangdong can recruit the 19th Route Army is still a question. (January 18)</p>
<p>Sun Dianying</p>
<h3>Troops Remaining in Shanxi Head West</h3>
<p>｜Representatives of the Sun unit talk about the reasons for heading west｜</p>
<p>A dispatch from Taiyuan states that the 41st Army under Sun Dianying has always been known for its strength. For several years, they have been stationed in Shanxi, accumulating pent-up feelings for a long time. Last year, they were ordered to resist the Japanese and had great determination, hoping to achieve something on the desert battlefield in the north. However, the military affairs against the Japanese ended invisibly after the armistice agreement was signed. Sun was then ordered to head west. However, when they arrived in Baotou, they were prevented from advancing by Ma Hongkui of Ningxia. After repeated negotiations, there were few results. Therefore, Sun took active action to head west. The troops remaining in Shanxi had already begun to depart long ago, numbering about 60,000. Only hundreds of engineers and a small number of military police remained in Jin City. When Sun's troops were stationed in Shanxi, the authorities, in order to reduce the extra burden on the local people, stipulated that the provincial government would provide a monthly subsidy of 60,000 yuan. All military pay was publicly sold and purchased by the military headquarters, and no further extortion was allowed from the local areas. This subsidy has been in place for two years. The authorities now believe that Sun's troops have all left Shanxi, the rural economy of Shanxi Province has been bankrupt, and both public and private finances are in difficulty. It has now been decided that the subsidy will be temporarily suspended from the end of February of this year. The situation of Sun's army heading west is closely watched here, as how the future will unfold has many implications for the geography of Shanxi and Suiyuan. According to Gao Mengqin, Sun's representative stationed in Shanxi, the reason for Sun's army heading west is roughly: "After the end of our army's military affairs against the Japanese, we moved to the Baotou area to prepare to go to Qinghai for land reclamation. The central government believed that the weather was cold and the march was difficult, so they ordered us to temporarily stop heading west. Chairman Chiang and Minister He also had telegrams to this effect. However, the Baotou area is desolate, and the soldiers are mostly sleeping in tents, without clothes or food. They will either starve to death or freeze to death. They have no choice but to seek a way to survive to avoid sitting and waiting for death. The fertile area is on the border of Ningxia and Shaanxi, with a mild climate, so we decided to move there to spend the winter and engage in land reclamation in the spring. However, we had to pass through Dengkou and Pingluo to reach our destination. Army Commander Sun repeatedly telegraphed the central government and Chairman Ma in advance, explaining the plight of having to move. Unexpectedly, when the army was in Dengkou, we suddenly encountered strangely shaped cavalry blocking our way. However, even if there are cavalry bandits in the area, there should not be so many. The truth is still unclear. However, our army's move this time is indeed to seek a way to survive and carry out land reclamation. I dare to solemnly declare to the friendly army and Chairman Ma that there is absolutely no malice. However, if we cannot be understood and are prevented from crossing, the result is truly unimaginable. Our army's move to the fertile area is inevitable, and we will not hesitate in the face of any obstacles. In short, this incident is due to the issue of passage and will not affect the overall political situation. Moreover, if there is another agency, why wait until after the defeat of the Fujian army before launching it? This is obvious. This move is related to our army's life and death. Even without the Fujian Incident, our army would have to set off." (January 16)</p>
<p>Sichuan-Xikang Inspection Group</p>
<h3>Record of Being Blocked by Sand at the New Dike (3) - Striving Onward</h3>
<p>Struggling for Nine Days, Enduring All Hardships</p>
<p>Having Crossed the Shifting Sands, We Reached Yichang</p>
<p>The Yongnian Wheel arrived in Hankou on the 11th and docked at the new airport pier. The group members disembarked one after another, but the climate in Hankou was quite cold. On the way, passengers in rickshaws were seen burying their heads in the fur collars of their coats. On the morning of the 11th, the Yongnian Wheel left Hankou and headed west, passing Xindi in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, due to the shallow water in winter, the riverbed was full of mud and sand. If we proceeded boldly, we would surely run aground. The customs launch warned the Yongnian not to proceed.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the Yongnian authorities formulated a plan: the first step was to send someone to Xindi to hire a boat to unload the cargo, reducing the draft of the ship. The second step was to, if no boat could be hired at Xindi, send a telegram to the Minsheng Company in Hankou from Xinxindi, requesting them to send a boat to unload the cargo. However, in the end, no boat could be hired at Xindi, and the telegram was very slow. Therefore, both plans failed, and the Yongnian had to return to Hankou. After arriving in Hankou, the Yongnian authorities waited for the Minguai Wheel, which was following the Yongnian from Shanghai, to arrive in Hankou, and then ordered the group members to transfer to the Minguai to continue their journey, in order to avoid delays. However, at 9 p.m. on the 13th, the Minguai arrived in Hankou. Knowing that the Minguai's draft was similar to that of the Yongnian, it was thought that if the Minguai could safely pass Yan Wu Guan, the Yongnian would have nothing to worry about. Therefore, the Yongnian unloaded cargo on one hand and followed the Minguai forward on the other, taking a line of risk. On the morning of the 14th, the Yongnian left Hankou again and headed west. Around 5 or 6 p.m., it passed Xindi again and docked at the same location where it had been blocked before. The Minguai, also exhausted due to the darkness, could not risk proceeding further. The two ships anchored in the river to rest, hoping to cross the mud and sand together towards Yichang on the morning of the 15th. On the morning of the 15th, the Yongnian and Minguai indeed opened full power and desperately crawled through the mud. After four or five hours of struggle, neither ship could cross the more than two hundred feet of shallow water covered in silt. They had to return to their original positions and look for another route. On the 16th, the Yongnian unloaded its cargo onto the Minguai to reduce its draft, still hoping to cross the shifting sands. However, the experiment on the morning of the 17th failed again. On the 18th, it was decided to unload the cargo from the Minguai onto the Yongnian. It was said that the Minguai had a shallower draft and might be able to pass this Yan Wu Road. However, no one on the ship dared to guarantee whether the Minguai would pass safely when it sailed on the 19th. As such, they had been anchored for nine days, tossed about in the middle of the river, at a loss. As the saying goes, the road to Shu is difficult, but who would have thought that it would be so difficult even before reaching the Shu border?</p>
<p>A group affairs meeting was held on the ship to decide on the course of action. It was decided that if the Minguai still could not pass the silt on the morning of the 19th, the Minsheng Company would be asked to find a solution. If all other methods failed, the inspection of Sichuan and Kang would be postponed until the spring when the water level rose. Moreover, at present, Dajianlu and Mount Emei and other places are blocked by ice and snow, and the north wind tears the skin. The journey west is not easy. It would be more beneficial to the on-site inspection to wait for the weather to improve slightly before proceeding.</p>
<p>The Yangzi River waterway has the most twists and turns of any river in the country, and the area near Xindi is the sharpest turn to the south, with a very acute angle. It is also the outlet of the Hong River into the Yangtze River. This winter's shallow water is also unusually unusual. Therefore, the sand washed down from the upstream gathers here and cannot flow away. According to Manager Xie of the Yongnian Wheel, who is experienced in navigating the Yangtze River, this phenomenon is a first in his twenty years of experience.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, our agency received a shipping message from a reporter who went to Sichuan, knowing that the Shanghai reporter group going to Sichuan was obstructed by the quicksand of the Yangtze River, causing the Yonggui Minsheng two rounds, until the 17th, still stuck in the Xindi River surface. After inquiring from the Minsheng Industrial Company, it was learned that the deepest navigation channel in the river was first stuck by a certain ship, resulting in broken traffic. Now the ship has been driven away, so the Yongnian Minguai two rounds have been able to pass. It is estimated that the reporter group to Sichuan has arrived in Yichang and changed boats to go upstream.</p>
<h3>The Hunan Bandits Severely Injured</h3>
<p>Three Pseudo-Division Commanders Killed in Succession</p>
<p>Chen Jicheng and Guo Rudong Telegraph Triumphs</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, the remnant bandits in Southern Hubei, after failing to attack Chongtong, fled east along the Fushui River. The military focus then shifted to Yangxin. The bandits remaining in the Xianpu area now only number two or three thousand, entrenched in Gaoqiao, Zhongping, Xianrendong, Yangquanban, and Tutiao Shikeng. They have already been attacked by the 33rd Division of Feng Xingxian. Those who fled to Yangxin are the main force of the bandits, including the Pseudo-Northern Jiangxi Independent Division, the Pseudo-Third Division, and the Hebei Independent Second Division. In the past ten days, they have fought fiercely with the 26th Division of Guo Rudong and the Liu Peixu Li Zongjian units. They have recently been completely defeated. The Pseudo-Division Commanders Yang Xicheng, Liu Yonghong, and Liu Jisida have been killed in battle one after another. The remnant bandits are scattered. The commander of the Western Route Third Column, Chen Jicheng, and the commander of the 26th Division, Guo Rudong, telegraphed the headquarters of the three provinces' bandit suppression and the Hubei Pacification Commissioner's Office on the 18th from Daye and Yangxin respectively, reporting their victories. The two telegrams are recorded separately as follows: (1) Chen Jicheng's victory telegram stated, "The Third Bandit Division and the Pseudo-Northern Jiangxi Independent Division, gathered scattered bandits from various places, numbering more than 7,000, with more than 3,000 guns, suddenly launched fierce attacks on the defensive areas of my Zhang and Liu brigades in Hutianshan, Hezikong, and Mushigang on the 5th. The situation was extremely dangerous. I immediately ordered the Guo Division, and the Liu, Zhang, and New Seventh Brigades to leave their defensive positions and launch an attack, joining forces to encircle and suppress. On the 7th, in a fierce battle in Hutianshan, 40 to 50 bandits were killed and dozens of guns were captured. On the 10th, more than 100 bandits were killed and 40 to 50 were captured alive in Xiabenyuan, and more than ten guns were captured. The bandits were defeated and fled west in full force. I ordered Liu Brigade to track them down and suppress them, and the New Seventh Brigade to defend and control the main points along both banks of the Fu River in Xintanpu. The bandits happened to flee north through Daqiaopu on the 11th. My Guo Division and Liu Brigade arrived in pursuit. The New Seventh Brigade took advantage of their crossing and fiercely fired upon them, killing 700 to 800, capturing more than 200 alive, and drowning countless others. Two to three hundred guns were captured. The bandits fled in disarray to the Zoumalizijing Mountain area. My division and brigade commanders surrounded the bandits on all sides on the 13th, engaging in a bloody battle all day and night, charging in melee combat, and resolving the main force of the bandits. In this battle, 700 to 800 were killed, including Yang Xicheng, the commander of the Pseudo-Northern Jiangxi Division. Corpses were everywhere, blocking the roads. More than 300 were captured alive, including the chief of staff and regimental commander of the Third Bandit Division, and several important bandit leaders. More than 400 guns and countless military supplies were captured. The rest are still being reported separately. In total, more than 2,000 bandits were killed, 500 to 600 were captured alive, and more than 1,000 guns were captured. This group of bandits, after being repeatedly encircled and suppressed by our various units, has only a remnant of more than 1,000 left, now scattered and lurking in the Datianban, Zijing Mountain, Caijia Temple area. I have ordered all units to heavily encircle and suppress them in separate ways, striving to eliminate them completely." (2) Guo Rudong's victory telegram stated, "My division's Tang battalion pursued northwest from Yongfu'ao on the morning of the 15th to Luojialong. They searched and suppressed horizontally and vertically in the vicinity of the area on both the 15th and 16th, and encountered remnant bandits from time to time, giving them a painful blow and capturing 12 rifles. My Huang battalion searched and suppressed in the vicinity of Zhoujiaban, capturing 2 rifles. Hearing that scattered bandits were ambushed in Zijing Mountain, a special service company of Shen was dispatched to attack them, capturing 9 rifles. According to the captured bandits, the deputy commander Liu Yonghong of the Pseudo-Third Division, and the commander Liu Jisida of the Hebei Independent Second Division, were also killed in battle. Among the Third Pseudo-Division, in addition to the Pseudo-Seventh Regiment Commander, who was captured by the New Seventh Brigade, the Pseudo-Ninth Regiment Commander was also seriously injured. Now, the officers and soldiers among the bandits cannot take care of each other, etc. It is sufficient to believe that these days, only over-remnant bandits are being suppressed, and it can also be proved that the Third Pseudo-Division, the Pseudo-Northern Jiangxi Division, and the Pseudo-Hebei Division have all been crushed. Currently, Chen Zhulin still has various pseudo-troops gathering remnants, and there are no pseudo-officials leading the bandits. The number of people and guns is about 500. In addition to ordering the Tang battalion to return to Chen Zhulin to suppress them and quickly plan to wipe them out, the remnant bandits in the Caijia Temple and Wujia Temple areas are being searched and suppressed by the friendly troops who have arrived in the area. Respectfully presented." (19th)</p>
<p>Anhui Garrison Headquarters</p>
<h3>Bandit Zhu Yanqiu Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence, Anhui Provincial Government Chairman Liu Zhenhua, repeatedly received orders from the Central Government to arrest the bandit Zhu Yanqiu. He instructed the Garrison Headquarters to cooperate with the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to send a team to arrest him at Song's private residence in Shijiatang at 11 p.m. on the 16th. Zhu was taken to the Garrison Headquarters, and after a trial was opened at 3 a.m. that night, he was tied to the execution ground outside Xiaodongmen at 5 a.m. on the 17th and executed by firing squad. The charges announced by the Garrison Headquarters and Liu's original telegram to Chairman Chiang are recorded separately below. (1) Charges, "For the purpose of proclamation, I have received the order from the Commander-in-Chief of the Border Region of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Anhui and the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government Liu, and I have also received secret reports from Party and government agencies. Zhu Yanqiu recruited bandits, plotted wrongdoing, and disrupted local public security. The evidence is solid, and he is indeed guilty of unforgivable crimes. He will be executed by firing squad immediately to show an example to others, etc. In accordance with this order, the prisoner was taken for execution by firing squad today. It is necessary to issue a proclamation for general knowledge, this proclamation." (2) Liu's telegram to Chairman Jiang (titles omitted) "It has been found that the notorious bandit Zhu Yanqiu formed a gang to incite rebellion and endanger public security. He has repeatedly received orders to arrest and handle the matter, but he still estimates evil and does not repent, openly opening mountains to recruit disciples in the provincial capital, performing plays to collect money in Anwu and other places, and his power is spreading. He secretly transports firearms and sells drugs, committing all kinds of illegal activities. His criminal record is obvious. He is also trying to seize the opportunity to cause chaos in Fujian, plotting wrongdoing. I have repeatedly received secret reports from Party, government, military and other agencies. The evidence is indeed conclusive. Last night, I sent the police to secretly investigate and arrest him. The prisoner was gathering a crowd for a gambling binge when he was arrested on the spot. Secret sports and fraudulent letters were also found. The oath of alliance to recruit disciples, the self-defense militia seal, and firearms and ammunition were all examined one by one. The 　admissions were irrefutable. Such a gang of bandits plotting rebellion and causing trouble to the locality is indeed guilty of unforgivable crimes. Zhenhua, in order to maintain order and strictly curb the seeds of chaos, has already handed it over to the Garrison Headquarters today to be executed by firing squad in accordance with military law to show an example to others. I respectfully report this matter. I beg for your review. Your subordinate Liu Zhenhua kowtows to Xiao, (17th) Shen Yin," (January 18th)</p>

<h3>Villagers of Fanjiabang Robbed</h3>
<p>About one mile away in Punan, the home of Sun Caifeng, a villager in Fanjiabang, was suddenly attacked by a gang of bandits on the evening of the 17th. They broke through the side door and rushed in, frightening and forbidding them from making noise. The principals Fan Caifeng and his wife were tied up and their mouths were stuffed with cotton. Then they entered the bedroom, overturning boxes and cabinets, looting clothing, cash, etc., worth hundreds of yuan. Having achieved their desires, they left with the loot, shouting and whistling. The principals have already issued a loss report and reported it to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>District Affairs Meeting Resolves to Present to the County for Dredging of the City River</h3>
<p>The dredging of the city river in this city has been overdue for five or six years, and it has become increasingly silted up, affecting the prosperity of the commercial market, hindering the drinking water of the citizens, and is of great concern. In case of fire, the river water is particularly dry and difficult to use. The citizens urgently hope to dredge it, but the construction is huge and the cost is high, which cannot be done by the power of one district. At the beginning of taking office, Commissioner Jin first paid attention to it, and sent a technical office to measure it. He also contacted the leaders of various agencies to discuss the progress. At that time, it was appropriate for the busy farming season, and the period was postponed to the farming gap. At yesterday's district affairs meeting of the first district, the case of dredging the city river was discussed. It was resolved that the county government should be asked to submit a request, because the spring season is approaching in a flash, and if preparations are not made in advance, the opportunity to dredge may be missed. It is requested that preparations be made immediately, so as to open the river in the coming spring and comfort the people's hopes.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Boat Opens Fire to Resist Arrest</h3>
<p>Yesterday (20th) morning at 8 o'clock, two patrol boats of the Qimenwai Wuhuanjing Tax Case discovered nine smuggling boats. They immediately chased them. The salt boats opened fire to resist arrest. The two sides fired for about an hour. The salt bandits were unable to support themselves. After capturing three salt boats, the remaining seven boats fled to Shuangmiao Port. The county water patrol captain Cheng Delong happened to be patrolling to the area. Hearing the news, he immediately joined forces with Zhu Gang, the captain of the first police squadron of the county, and led a team to pursue the Shuangmiao Port.</p>
<h3>Construction Department Urges Construction of the Suzhou-Changshu Highway</h3>
<p>The Construction Department believes that the Suzhou-Jiashan section of Fuhuo Road has been completed and opened to traffic, but the Suzhou-Changshu section has not yet been started. Yesterday (20th), it specifically ordered the Wu County Government to quickly prepare a plan and budget and submit it to the department for approval and construction.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<h3>Submit Plan for Dredging the Li River for Approval</h3>
<p>Xu Dingkang, Director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, believes that the various sections of the silted up Li Canal are small and shallow, which hinders navigation and blocks transportation. When the water is high, it also hinders drainage and causes disasters. It is imperative to dredge it, but the project is huge and the funds are insufficient, making it difficult to start. Therefore, he drafted a plan to solicit labor and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. Once approved, he will immediately start soliciting labor to begin dredging.</p>

<h3>Sentencing of Appeal for Shooting and Killing Uncle Case</h3>
<p>Bao Qingyuan, a member of the Baojiakang security group in Yin County, was at odds with his uncle Huaiqing. In July of last year, he colluded with his fellow villager He Axiang to invite Huaiqing out. In the darkness of night, he opened fire and killed his uncle. After the case was discovered, the Yin County District Court determined that he had premeditated to kill a collateral respected relative and sentenced him to death. He appealed without accepting this and the Higher Court. Yesterday, the Third Criminal Court questioned him, and his statements were mostly evasive. However, it could not prove that his behavior was premeditated. The original sentencing part was inappropriate and was changed to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Appeal Again in the Case of Plotting to Kill Husband</h3>
<p>Cao Cai Cao of Shicun, Xiaoshan, colluded with her lover Xu Arong and accomplice Cao Chuanlai to plot to kill her husband Cai Meisheng. The first instance sentenced both the man and woman to death. The appeal to the Higher Court was rejected. A third instance appeal was filed. The Supreme Court returned it for retrial. As a result, it was determined that Cai Cao had indeed premeditated and was still sentenced to death. Xu Arong's sentence was changed to life imprisonment. Now Cai is still not convinced and has again hired a lawyer to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Last Year's Foreign Trade</p>
<h3>Import Surplus of Over 410 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the numbers related to China's total import and export trade over the year, from January to November, are said to be over 700 million for the import surplus, and over 670 million. The numbers are all different and no one is certain. Even the annual import surplus number is not yet announced. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter found the correct number in the Customs General Taxation Division's Statistics Department. (1) From January to November, the total amount of imports was 345.497302 in gold units, which is equivalent to 675.705227 yuan. The total amount of exports was 292.544146 yuan.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Will Go to Beijing After Meeting Chiang</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang was originally scheduled to go to Beijing the night before to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, but this has been suspended due to certain matters. According to sources close to Zhang, Zhang must wait until Chairman Chiang arrives in Beijing, or meet him in Shanghai, before going to Beijing.</p>
<p>It is said that there is no scheduled date yet.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Zhang Xueliang, the former chairman of the Beiping Military Sub-Committee, specially sent Mi Chunlin to Caisouli, Julai Road, in the French Concession the day before to visit the families of the Northeast anti-Japanese soldiers stationed in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, Mi again presented Zhang Xueliang and Li Du's business cards and went to the Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees of various charitable organizations in Shanghai on Yunnan Road to express gratitude. The association entertained the families of anti-Japanese generals of Li Du, Wang Delin, Su Bingwen, etc., to express their gratitude.</p>
<p>Li Liejun is still not fully recovered from high blood pressure and is afraid that he will not be able to make it to the capital in time to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Executive Yuan</p>
<h3>Please Allocate Loans to Dredge Songjiang</h3>
<p>The river's condition concerns the wealth of the Southeast</p>
<p>Water conservancy work is even more urgent</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of the Interior yesterday (titles omitted). "The Wusong River is one of the three rivers of ancient times, with the water of Taihu Lake at the upper reaches, and the Huangpu River at the lower reaches flowing into the sea. The main stream is more than two hundred miles long. The rivers and canals on both sides are intertwined and converging. The discharge of hundreds of rivers depends on it. The fields that directly and indirectly benefit from the river along the way, including Wu County, Kunshan, Wujiang, Taicang, Qingpu, Jiading, Shanghai, Baoshan, and other eight counties, are estimated by people to be at least more than eight million mu. Therefore, the work of dredging has been valued since ancient times. Historical records can be verified, and there is no need to repeat them. Nowadays, the national finances rely on the Southeast, and Suzhou and Songjiang are particularly important areas in the Southeast. Water conservancy work is even more urgent. During the seventh year of the Republic of China, the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau established the Wusong River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to be responsible for dredging. However, due to the shortage of provincial funds, the construction work only started from the Fanwangdu Railway Bridge in the west to the Xinzha Bridge in the east. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the legal groups of the eight counties along the river organized the Wusong River Water Conservancy Association to raise funds to carry out large-scale dredging. Later, the eight counties decided to make it an item for dredging the Songjiang River to be collected along with the busy work, or the decision was made and then overturned, or the collected funds were mostly misappropriated, which led to the construction of the entire upper and lower reaches becoming a pipe dream. The association borrowed money from banks in many ways, and only managed to complete the section from Xinzha Bridge to Waibaidu Bridge in the east before it was suddenly stopped. Summing up the two constructions, the efforts were only focused on the downstream section of Shanghai's territory that leads to the sea. Moreover, Shanghai's city is full of shops and dwellings, with Chinese and foreigners living together, and it is inevitable that some waterways have been encroached upon. Therefore, dredging is quickly followed by siltation, and there is no great benefit. As for the overall plan, it is mostly impossible to implement due to financial constraints. In recent years, although the Junpu Bureau has undertaken dredging beyond its authority, the construction work is also in the section from Fanwangdu to Waibaidu Bridge, which is roughly the same as before. Every winter, the river is dry and the water is shallow, and there are often incidents of ships running aground. This is the general situation of dredging the river over the years. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Construction Committee organized the Wusong River Dredging Committee, and the Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Committee was also one of the members of the committee. The Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Committee originally intended to have a construction plan for dredging the Songjiang River. According to its estimate, the total cost from Guajingkou in the upper reaches to the sea in the lower reaches is 1.5 million yuan. It was proposed at the first meeting on April 11 of that year. Later, on May 13 of the same year, another meeting was convened. Finally, due to the lack of concrete methods for raising funds, it was stranded until now. Recently, it has been heard that the Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Committee, after consulting opinions from all parties, has re-determined the dredging plan and the construction budget, which is estimated to require 2.14 million yuan. It has also been determined that a part of the US cotton and wheat loans designated by the National Economic Committee will be used for water conservancy. The Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Committee, based on this proposal, directly submitted a request to the Ministry of the Interior to allocate funds first to start construction. This matter has been planned and discussed since the seventh year of the Republic of China, not just once. It is only because of financial limitations that it has been almost fifteen years, and it has only become a situation where there is much talk and little success. Now that a part of the cotton and wheat loans has been allocated for relief, it is hoped that the years of expectation can be realized. It is requested that your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) preside over it and approve it for handling, which is for the public good. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows.</p>

<p>Fifth Batch</p>
<h3>American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Five Ships Can Come Within Four Days</p>
<p>A Total of 36,000 to 37,000 Tons</p>
<p>A total of four batches of American wheat loaned have been loaded and arrived in Shanghai, divided into six ships, totaling about 46,000 tons. The wheat is currently being unloaded in the Huangpu River. The fifth batch was loaded from Portland. Yesterday, the Cotton and Wheat Management Office received telegrams from the ships carrying the wheat. The five ships, Harbottletown, New York, Nasjun, and Meryl, were carrying a total of 36,000 to 37,000 tons and had all passed Japan. From the 21st to the 24th, the five ships of American wheat will all be transported to Shanghai within these four days. It is found that the total amount of the fifth batch of American wheat is 360,000 to 370,000 dans, which have all been sold to various flour mills. However, the market price has been lower recently. The goods carried by the five ships are worth more than 2.5 million yuan. After arriving in Shanghai, they will still be unloaded by river cylinders and transferred to warehouses on the Suzhou River. Yesterday, the various flour mills were notified to send ships to unload. It is found that from the 18th of last month to the 24th of this month, American wheat worth about 6 million yuan has been transported one after another.</p>

<p>River Water Continues to Recede</p>
<h3>Hunan Route Blocked</h3>
<p>Shipping route in the Hunan-Hubei section is blocked by water.</p>
<p>Between Yichang and Chongqing, cargo is reduced and shallow-water vessels are used.</p>
<p>Recently, the Yangtze River's water level has been decreasing daily, hindering commercial vessels. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are receding even more severely. The Hunan-Hubei line is almost impassable. A detailed report is provided below.</p>
<h3>Changsha Shipping Halted</h3>
<p>From Hankou to Changsha, Hunan, the river water had receded to about seven feet in the previous few days, and commercial vessels could not pass through the Chenglingji area. Many Changsha liners are blocked in the Xindi area. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, the river water there has fallen to five and a half feet. The Hunan-Hubei section of the route has also been blocked by shallow water. Currently, cargo destined for Changsha is being transported by small-wheeled iron barges, except for the use of shallow-water vessels. All larger Yangtze vessels cannot navigate.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Blocks Salt Shipments</h3>
<p>Salt shipments loaded from the Haizhou Shiyibu area, bound for various ports along the Yangtze River, have been blocked in Wuhu since the 15th of this month. Several vessels have run aground due to their deep draft and are unable to sail upstream. Yesterday, this port received a telegram from Wuhu stating that the river water is receding and not rising. The stranded salt vessels have hired a large number of small vessels and tugs to begin transferring cargo upstream. For downstream Yangtze vessels, the Jianghan Customs has limited drafts to one foot and two and a half inches.</p>
<h3>All Large Vessels Halted Between Yichang and Chongqing</h3>
<p>All large vessels on the Yichang-Chongqing route have been completely suspended. Even below Yichang, on the line from Shashi to Hankou, various shipping companies at this port have stopped ships over 1,000 tons from the 18th, switching to small, shallow-water vessels with flat bottoms of 200 tons. As for the Yangtze vessels below Hankou, starting yesterday, export cargo will be reloaded to 50% and inspected at concession factories.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Stalled Negotiations</h3>
<p>Feetham proposed four revisions to the draft agreement.</p>
<p>Our side firmly opposes being directed by the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that negotiations between Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Feetham, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement, regarding the issue of factory inspections in the concession, have reached a stalemate and have been temporarily suspended. The New Voice News Agency reporter learned from various sources the reasons for the temporary suspension. After Yu Hongjun and Feetham agreed on a draft plan of seven items, the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors opposed it at a meeting and it was not passed. Feetham then negotiated with the municipal government again, requesting four revisions: (1) The number of inspectors would be changed to four from each side. (2) Factories established by foreign merchants would not be subject to inspection by purely Chinese inspectors. (3) The hygiene and safety sections of the Factory Law should be implemented during the one-year trial period. (4) Inspectors should be directed by the Secretariat of the Public Works Bureau, but in the event of a dispute, it would be resolved by the secretariats of both sides. Our side agreed to the first item and agreed to the third item with an exchange of documents, but expressed disagreement with the remaining second and fourth items. The Public Works Bureau expressed approval of Feetham's revised draft, but the Public Works Bureau would direct and supervise the inspectors. Our side firmly opposed this, insisting on maintaining the original proposal or forming a committee with an equal number of people from both sides to direct and supervise the inspectors in exercising their duties.</p>
<p>Central Government Orders General Labor Union to Change Name</p>
<h3>City's Labor Sector to Hold General Assembly</h3>
<p>Resolution to petition the Central Government to revise the current Trade Union Law.</p>
<p>Denial of changing the new name and a unified effort to argue based on reason.</p>
<p>It is reported that although the city's General Labor Union has been approved and filed by the city's Party Headquarters, it is legally unfounded. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has ordered that the new name be changed to the United Association of Trade Unions for National Salvation, etc. According to news from the General Labor Union, this matter is of great importance to the labor sector. Since the Central Government promulgated the Trade Union Law, it has only allowed the organization of united associations of various trade unions, but not the organization of a General Labor Union. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee of the former General Labor Union of this city was dissolved due to the restrictions of the law. The city's labor movement has lost its overall leadership and has fallen into a state of decline. After the September 18th Incident, the city's labor sector, fearing the urgency of national crisis, believed that it would be futile not to concentrate its efforts, align its steps, and unite against external forces. Therefore, by the resolution of the city's labor representatives' congress, this association was established. Since its establishment three years ago, it has achieved significant results through efforts and struggles. All trade unions in the city have recognized this association as the only leading organization in the city's labor movement and it has been recognized by legal entities. However, due to legal restrictions, it has not been able to obtain the status of a legal entity. The association petitioned the City Party Headquarters last year, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Government based on factual needs and requesting that the Trade Union Law be amended to provide relief. After careful consideration, the City Party Headquarters believed that the association's past work had made great efforts for the Party and the country, such as raising funds for the Shanghai Labor Aircraft, holding benefit performances to rescue Northeastern refugees, and comforting anti-Japanese soldiers. There have been significant achievements, such as holding labor education lectures, labor temporary clinics, and labor night schools, and spared no effort in carrying out labor welfare undertakings. Therefore, it was approved for temporary filing and reported to the Central Government with detailed reasons. Now, the Central Civil Movement Committee has ordered the association to change its name to the United Association of Trade Unions for National Salvation. As the name implies, future work will be subject to extreme restrictions. The city's labor sector is surprised and puzzled. All sectors of agriculture, commerce, and academics have overall organizations such as municipal farmers' associations, municipal chambers of commerce, and student unions. Only the labor sector is lacking, which inevitably constitutes discrimination. Therefore, in addition to continuing to request the Central Government to amend the Trade Union Law and withdraw the order, the association will convene a temporary congress of labor representatives to discuss solutions. If the goal is not achieved, effective action will be taken.</p>

<p>China Aviation Tests South China Route</p>
<h3>Arrived in Kunming the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Xuzhou aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation, which was test flying the southwest route, was detained near Lang Son, Vietnam, the day before yesterday due to bad weather. After the Ministry of Communications, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent a telegram of proof for its release, it was still piloted by Nie Kaiyi, director of the Aviation Group, and pilot An Laisheng. It took off from Lang Son at 12:00 noon on the 19th and headed for Kunming. According to the person in charge of the company, the southwest test flight aircraft left Lang Son on the 19th and arrived in Kunming that night. Whether it will leave Kunming and continue flying to Chongqing this morning (20th) has not been reported by telegram.</p>
<h3>Petition to Abolish Arduous Taxes on Alcohol</h3>
<p>In order to revitalize industry and maintain domestic products.</p>
<p>Representatives of the cosmetics, hardware, and new drug industries of this port jointly proposed to the Shanghai National Products Factory United Association that alcohol is one of the raw materials for industry, and the annual demand for industrial products is huge. Since the customs autonomy in May last year, the import tax on alcohol has increased by more than twenty times. Currently, the import tax on alcohol is 45.6 cents per gallon, including surtaxes and customs duties, equivalent to about 91 cents in national currency. Each gallon costs $1.50, which increases the cost of Chinese merchant products, making it impossible to compete with foreign merchants. Business has plummeted and is in danger of not being sustained. According to the current tariff system, after one tax, no further tax is levied. However, the same product, once in the hands of a Chinese merchant, must be subject to an additional stamp tax of $1.50 per gallon, which is tantamount to protecting and dumping by foreign merchants. The government must weigh the pros and cons and consider it unacceptable. Fortunately, the Premier of the Executive Yuan has ordered his subordinates to report arduous taxes and miscellaneous taxes. This arduous tax, which reverses the tax burden between Chinese and foreign merchants, should be included in the list of items to be abolished. Therefore, it is proposed to request a resolution to forward the petition to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry for approval and abolition in order to maintain the industry. It is reported that the meeting resolved to forward the petition accordingly.</p>
<p>Draft Contract for Sino-German Steel Plant</p>
<h3>Berlin Head Office Telegraphed Agreement</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review and approval before signing.</p>
<p>Preparation of machinery, factory buildings, and materials is about to begin for shipment to China.</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that the draft contract for the joint venture between the Ministry of Industry, the National Economic Council, and the German company Gutehoffnungshütte (GHH) to establish a central state-owned steel plant has been decided upon through consultation. The Shanghai branch telegraphed the full text of the draft contract to the Berlin head office, which has telegraphed its agreement. The Ministry of Industry will formally sign the contract after submitting it to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. The factory site has been surveyed and determined to be in Ma'anshan, and construction will be completed and production will begin in three years. The details are listed below.</p>
<h3>Draft Determined</h3>
<p>The Sino (Ministry of Industry and National Economic Council) German (GHH) joint venture for the state-owned steel plant was initiated in June last year. The representatives of both parties, after a long period of research and consultation, have decided on the draft contract. The total capital is 60 million yuan, with China and Germany each subscribing half. However, because of the country's financial difficulties, China's share of the funds will be temporarily borrowed from the German company GHH. Interest will be paid annually from the date of signing the contract until the factory is completed and steel production officially begins, at which point the principal will be repaid on schedule in four years. For the loan guarantee, the Ministry of Industry will guarantee 10 million with fishery income, and the remaining 20 million will be agreed upon with the Ministry of Finance, using treasury bonds as collateral.</p>
<h3>German Side Agrees</h3>
<p>GHH has three steel plants. The head office is located in Berlin, and branches are established in the capitals of various countries and important commercial ports. It has strong capital and a large scale, and is the leader in the international copper and iron manufacturing industry. Since the Ministry of Industry planned to build various state-owned enterprises last year (the copper and iron plant was also one of the largest plans), it was approved by the Executive Yuan. Then, the German manager of the Shanghai branch of GHH, Yongdorf, and the comprador Chen Gusheng went to Beijing to contact Minister Chen. As a result, it was decided to jointly operate with the company. The contract and implementation plan were well prepared after four or five months of consultation. It was originally intended to be signed and implemented in mid-September last year, but the Executive Yuan believed that the state-owned enterprise was a major consultation and requested the Economic Council to assist in planning and review the contract, which led to the delay. After the three parties jointly decided on the draft contract, the Shanghai branch of the company translated the draft into German and telegraphed it to the Berlin head office for review. It agreed to the repayment of loan principal and interest and the construction of factory machinery. However, the management and business authority were slightly modified. Its reply telegram arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Submitted to the Court for Review</h3>
<p>After receiving the head office's agreement reply telegram, the Shanghai branch of the German company GHH, the comprador Chen Gusheng, took the draft contract to Beijing the night before last to reply to the Ministry of Industry. Regarding the management and business authority aspects modified by the head office, internal organizational issues are not difficult to resolve. According to the Ta Kung Pao reporter, it was learned from relevant sources that the Ministry of Industry intends to report the joint draft contract to the Executive Yuan for review within days. Once approved, the three parties will proceed with the formal signing, which should not exceed next month.</p>
<h3>Machinery and Factory Buildings</h3>
<p>The site of the state-owned steel plant has been surveyed and determined to be in Ma'anshan. The factory buildings and production machinery cost 40 million yuan, and the mining and coal machinery and buildings cost 20 million yuan. The drawings have already been completed, and various materials such as machinery and factory buildings have been prepared. After the contract is signed and the procedures are completed, they will be shipped from Germany to China. The entire project will be completed within three years. After it is established and put into operation in the future, it can produce 350 tons of pure steel per day, making it the largest state-owned factory in China.</p>
<p>Special Party Department of the Security Office</p>
<h3>Telegram of Condolences to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Special Party Department of the Shanghai Security Office telegraphed quickly via postal service to Nanchang to Chairman Chiang: Chen and Li rebelled in Fujian, changed the era name and established a new regime, destroyed the Party and changed the flag, affecting the Central Government's almost successful campaign against the bandits and breaking the entire organization of the country. Their crimes are heinous and countless. Fortunately, you, sir, have adhered to the Central Government's intentions and openly attacked them. You have also gained the loyalty of the generals and soldiers at the front, and wherever the banners point, the rebels have been defeated. Within a month, the enemy's lair has been swept away and the traitors have collapsed, freeing the people of Fujian from their suffering and laying the foundation for the country's permanent stability. Your great achievements are admired by the whole country. We respectfully send a telegram of condolences, hoping you will appreciate it. The Preparatory Committee of the Special Party Department of the Shanghai Security Office of the Chinese Kuomintang, committee members Yang Hu, Zeng Zesheng, Wu Huan, Zou Yun, Jia Botao, Secretary-General Lu Jie, and all party members kowtow together.</p>

<p>Shanghai National Medicine Industry</p>
<h3>Appoint Representatives to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>According to news from the national medicine and national medicine industry, since China has been invaded by foreign forces, all industries have been greatly affected. National medicine and national medicine, which are related to history, national culture, public economy, have not been promoted by the government and other industries and merchants, so the business has been quite low in recent years. Now, medical and pharmaceutical groups from all over the country are taking advantage of the opportunity of the Fourth Plenary Session to send representatives to Beijing to petition the Congress. The purposes are: (1) To request the government to use the tax revenue of national medicine and national medicine undertakings to seek the development of national medicine and national medicine undertakings. (2) To request the government to announce the Chinese Medicine Regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan as soon as possible. (3) To request the government to allocate special funds to establish Chinese medicine schools in various provinces and cities, etc. The Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association has appointed Cai Tonghao, Cen Zhiliang, and Fei Yongzuo as representatives, and they will go to Beijing by express train on the 21st. National medical groups and pharmaceutical associations have also sent representatives to go together.</p>
<p>National Medical Association's Third Telegram</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Medical Association issued three telegrams yesterday, all addressed to the National Government, the Fourth Plenary Session, and the Legislative Yuan. The wording of the three telegrams was roughly the same. The following is the telegram to the National Government: To the National Government of the Republic of China. We believe that our country's medicine is dismissed as mysterious and unfounded by those who denigrate it, and praised as miraculously effective by those who commend it. In fact, our country's medical regulations are clear, and treatment based on them has a considerable effect. There is nothing miraculous, let alone mysterious. However, this kind of profound science cannot be understood by those who have not studied it deeply. Its denigration or praise has no impact on the academic itself. In terms of the object of medicine, ordinary diseases can be easily solved, and various intractable diseases that cannot be resolved by other medical techniques can often be cured by Chinese medicine. Therefore, until recently, it has still been trusted by the vast majority of the people, and national health has been maintained, people's economic livelihood has been maintained, and national tax revenue has been increased. The Republic of China takes the people as its foundation, and the government's facilities should be based on the trend of public opinion. On December 15th of last year, the Legislative Yuan held its 43rd meeting and passed ten articles of the Chinese Medicine Regulations based on the will of the people. It has been more than a month since then, but it has not been announced, and the public is anxious and speculative. We dare to telegraph to your government to quickly announce it according to law in order to respect the spirit of the Five Powers Constitution and benefit the culture of more than four thousand years. We cannot express the utmost anticipation and obedience. Shanghai National Medical Association, Chinese National Medical Association, Shenzhou National Medical Association, Shanghai National Medical Association, all respectfully kowtow together.</p>

<p>Revising Through-Ticket</p>
<h3>Method for Collecting Additional Fees</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Take Effect on February 1st</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Instructs Bureaus to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways yesterday instructed the two Railway Administrations that the special express train additional fees collected with through-tickets have been calculated in two ways: one is calculated separately according to the mileage traveled on each route, and the other is calculated according to the total through-mileage. The collection of additional fees for through-tickets has two methods, which are inconsistent and urgently need to be revised in the following two ways: (1) For all through-tickets, whether they are "Shanghai-Ping Through Train," "Pingpu Through Train," or "Special Express Trains on Various Routes," the collection of additional fees should be calculated uniformly according to the total through-mileage. At the same time, remove the eight words "its direct express train additional fee" from Article 28 of the Passenger Transport Rules, "When calculating the additional fee for special express trains, if the route passes through two or more routes, the additional fee for direct express trains should be calculated according to the total through-mileage." Replace the eight words "traveling mileage, calculated separately according to the route" in the Passenger Through-Ticket Fare Compilation, page 93, "When calculating the additional fee for special express trains, if the journey passes through two or more routes, it should be calculated separately according to the mileage traveled on each route" with the four words "through-mileage" to achieve uniformity. (2) Passengers holding Shanghai-Ping Through Train tickets may transfer to Pingpu or special express trains on various routes midway. If they hold Pingjin Through Train tickets or special express train tickets on this route, they may also transfer to Shanghai-Ping Through Trains without having to pay an additional fee. The above methods will be implemented from February 1st of this year. In addition to instructions and orders, you should immediately comply. This order has been forwarded to the Traffic Department for compliance by the bureau.</p>

<h3>Thirteenth Standing Committee Meeting of the Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>Report on Chongming County Magistrate Shen Jiang's Embezzlement of Relief Funds</p>
<p>Verification of Whether the Funds Allocated to Each Sandbank in Baoshan Were Impartial</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Sichuan Southern Chongbao Flood Relief Association held its thirteenth standing committee meeting at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 19th). The following standing committee members attended: Du Yuesheng, Xu Shiying, Wang Dankui, Huang Hanzhi, Huang Bode, Huang Renzhi, Shen Zijian, Zhang Xiaoliang (replacing Hanzhi), Gu Yueseng, Gu Nanqun, Lu Caifu, Qu Shaoheng, Huang Zhaolu, Yang Yuzhong, Li Zizai, Qu Shao Yi, Cai Danwei, Pan Zhiwen, Jin Houcheng, and nineteen others. Wang Dankui chaired the meeting.</p>
<h3>Matters for Report</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government replied to the Association, stating that the request to allocate 460,000 yuan from the provincial treasury for emergency relief was submitted to the 624th meeting of the Provincial Government for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that the provincial treasury was severely depleted, and the originally allocated 40,000 yuan had not yet been fully disbursed. It was decided that the Finance Department should allocate the due 20,000 yuan in advance, and the Finance Department has been ordered to do so. The Chongming County Political Affairs Branch stated in a letter that the 12th meeting of the branch had decided that County Magistrate Shen should continue to serve concurrently as the director of the Association's Chongming office, and Mr. Cai Zizhuo has been reappointed as the deputy director. Chairman Wang Dankui spoke, stating that Chongming County Magistrate Shen Jiang had expressed his unwillingness to be the director of relief work and had not distributed the relief rice, and claimed that he would not issue receipts for the Association's re-issuance of relief funds. He had colluded with the district chiefs of each district to forge reimbursement claims for the 5,000 yuan of relief funds that were previously in stock, intending to embezzle them. Such disregard for the disaster victims is difficult to remain silent about. Today, I have telegraphed the Provincial Government again, requesting that he be dismissed and investigated as soon as possible. The public agreed that Chongming County Magistrate Shen Jiang had been advised by the Association before, but now he is acting stubbornly and attempting to embezzle relief funds. The Provincial Government should be petitioned again to dismiss him and investigate him as soon as possible to warn against greed. At the same time, the county magistrate should be strictly questioned about the relief rice that he was ordered to distribute, and he should immediately return it. As of yesterday, the Association has received a total of 138,280 yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen in relief funds.</p>
<h3>Matters for Discussion</h3>
<p>Chen Siwen and 17 others from Yiyou Township in the fourth district of Chongming County sent a telegram, stating that the newly drawn shoreline by the Chongming office has damaged many houses and graves, and they have repeatedly requested a change, but have not been granted. They have attached a drawing and requested the Association to correct it. The resolution was to ask the chairman to select personnel to conduct an on-site survey, review, and handle the matter. Disaster victims of Ping'an Sandbank in Baoshan County and property owners Chen Yiyu and 3 others sent a letter, stating that the relief funds allocated by the Association last time seemed to be biased, and they hoped that after verifying the actual numbers, the allocation of funds would be based on the reports of the inspectors on the earthwork, so as to ensure fairness and prevent the Ping'an Sandbank and Chongwei area from being left out. The resolution was to ask Mr. Huang Zhaolu to report on the inspection of the revetment construction in Ping'an Sandbank. Mr. Jin Houcheng said that the revetment construction on each sandbank in Baoshan was originally set at 4 feet as the standard to prevent sea tides and not hinder spring plowing. The claims made by Chen Yiyu and others may be based on the original height, and they feel that they are being left out. The resolution was to check the files and forward a letter to the Baoshan office for detailed explanation, and to verify whether the previous allocation of funds was impartial and provide a response.</p>
<h3>Temporary Motions</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Zhiwen reviewed the register of extremely poor households in the three districts of Pudong, totaling 370 households, with 810 large mouths and 681 small mouths. The resolution was to distribute relief rice at the rate of one dou for large mouths and five sheng for small mouths. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>The weather is cold, the year is ending, and it is difficult for people to return home.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Heroes Petition for Relief</h3>
<p>Dagon Society reported that more than ten anti-Japanese heroes, including Ke Jun, jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Department's Social Affairs Bureau, requesting relief. The original text is as follows: "Petition for Request. We, Jun, etc., since the Northeast Incident, knowing the brutality of the Japanese invaders and the imminent loss of our country, have bravely risen up to resist, disregarding sacrifice. For the past two years, we have shed blood in the White Mountains and Black Waters to fight for the survival of our nation. Since the loss of Rehe and the ceasefire, the environment does not allow us to continue working, so we have drifted to Shanghai to join the Juxun Chemical Industry Society founded by Zhang Minli, specializing in selling cosmetics such as snow cream and tooth powder. For more than a month, we have been carrying iron boxes and selling along the streets, regardless of wind or rain. However, due to the poor quality and high price of the products, even though we have exhausted our sales efforts, we have not been able to sell them well. Recently, the company has been constantly and unjustifiably dismissing employees and imposing various unfair treatments. Recently, it has intensified its efforts and stopped providing food for all employees. At this time of cold weather and the end of the year, with no home to return to and no one to rely on, we are forced to starve to death to preserve our anti-Japanese integrity. We are deeply afraid that the public will misunderstand the truth, so we have prepared this document to request your review and verification, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3>Strike by Silverware Workshop Workers</h3>
<p>Workshops Join the Strike One After Another</p>
<p>Workers Schedule a Mass Meeting</p>
<p>There are a total of 64 silverware workshops in the city, employing approximately 300 workers. In 1928, the workshop owners signed an agreement with the silver shops to pay 1.36 yuan per piece, with the workshop owners receiving 20% and the workers receiving 80%. However, the silver shops have been paying at an 80% rate, which has caused a backlash from the workers. The union sent representatives to negotiate, but to no avail. The day before yesterday (the 17th), the workers of Sanjubao, Yuanchun, He, and other three shops took the lead in striking. Yesterday, the workers of Hong Peiji in Zhabei Hanqiao, Zhenghe on Penglai Road, and Tang Yuanji and Ye Shuchang on Ningbo Road also joined the strike. A total of about 150 workers from 10 shops have joined the strike, and the situation is becoming serious. The Silverware Industry Union has scheduled a general meeting of members' representatives at 1:00 PM on January 21 to discuss countermeasures and request the Party and government agencies to send representatives to provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Second Mariner Examination</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Held in Shanghai</p>

<p>Instructions from the Central People's Movement Committee</p>
<h3>Regulations on Holidays and Days Off for Factories</h3>
<p>A month ago, the Municipal General Labor Union and the Sixth District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, etc., reported that when the dates for commemorative holidays coincide with weekly days off, it is not clear whether they should be made up for or paid double wages, and there is no explicit provision in the law, causing disputes between labor and management, which are difficult to resolve. Therefore, they specially submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department and forwarded it to the Central People's Movement Committee for instructions. The Municipal Party Department has now received a reply from the Central People's Movement Committee, stating that if there is no provision for holidays and days off coinciding, there is no need to pay double wages or make up for the holiday. The original letter is recorded below: "Approved your Association's Letter No. 2338, regarding how to handle the payment of wages for workers in each factory on the day when holidays and days off coincide. As approved, according to the Central precedent, if a national commemorative day falls on a Sunday, and there is no explicit provision in the collective agreement or work agreement, there is no need to pay double wages or make up for the holiday. Correspondingly, this letter is returned for your information and instruction." It is reported that the Municipal Party Department has informed the relevant labor unions.</p>
<p>Little Sanbei Ship Changes Route</p>
<h3>Dispute Arises Over Expulsion of Middle-Class Cabin Workers</h3>
<p>The Maritime Union Sends Representatives to Negotiate, and a Small Number of Workers Leave the Ship</p>
<p>A Solution Will Be Determined After Yu Qiaqing Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>New Voice Society reports that a dispute arose yesterday over the expulsion of middle-class cabin workers due to the change of route of the Little Sanbei ship of the Sanbei Shipping Company. After the intervention of the Maritime Union, the dispute has been temporarily resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Change of Route</h3>
<p>The Little Sanbei ship of the Sanbei Company originally operated between Shanghai, Ningbo, and Wushantou (however, the Middle-Class Cabin Office claims that the ship operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo route in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, and on the Yangtze River route in the winter season, while the Maritime Union branch claims that the ship has been reassigned and only operates in the Shanghai-Ningbo area). The comprador Feng Dehua hired 31 middle-class cabin workers. On the 16th, the ship sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai and entered the Qiuxin Shipyard at Gaochangmiao South Wharf for repairs. The repairs were completed the day before yesterday, and yesterday it was changed to operate on the Yangtze River route.</p>
<h3>Expulsion of Stewards</h3>
<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday, the company suddenly hired 50-60 people and went to the ship's berth at the wharf, forcibly expelling all the middle-class cabin workers (i.e., stewards) from the ship. At that time, there was still plenty of time before the workers had to leave, so most of them were on land, and only five workers remained on the ship. The workers protested because they had not received a clear order, and a dispute arose. Those who looked like gangsters immediately dispersed. When the workers returned to the ship, they were very angry when they learned the details.</p>
<h3>Petition and Negotiation</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the workers sent representatives to report to the Maritime Union and the Middle-Class Cabin Office of the branch. At 2:00 PM, Zhou Xiaoting, Wang Oumin, Wei Xie Sheng, and representatives of each ship, Tan Songtang, Qian Ziyun, Gao Yongliu, and more than ten others, from the Middle-Class Cabin Office, together with Shen Laojiu, the representative of Little Sanbei, petitioned the Maritime Union and the Maritime Union branch. Sun Luping, the secretary of the General Union, and Hou Dachun received them, and Lu Shuangxi, the standing committee member of the branch, received them. They promised to negotiate according to law and ordered the workers to stay on the ship and not cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Situation on behalf of the view</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM, Sun Luping, the secretary of the Maritime Union, went to the company to negotiate. Yu Qiaqing, the manager of the company, was in Beijing and had not returned, so his son Shunmao met with him on his behalf. The company initially agreed that all workers, except for five who would remain on the ship, would have to leave. After repeated negotiations, in order to avoid escalating the dispute, it was agreed that 15 people would continue to work as usual, and a specific solution would be negotiated after Manager Yu returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>New Workers Board</h3>
<p>The Maritime Union also sent representative Cheng Deyuan and branch representative Song Xiaoyun to negotiate with Feng Dehua, the comprador of the ship. If the new workers wanted to follow the ship, they were not allowed to participate in the work. If a conflict arose due to the new workers competing for work, the company would be fully responsible. At the same time, the Hankou branch was informed to take care of them when the ship arrived, and the Water Police Bureau was notified to send police to maintain order. Except for 17 people who left the ship, the rest followed the ship, which left the wharf at 4:00 PM, fortunately without any accidents.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Invincible Broadcasting Studio</h3>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang Delivers the Opening Speech</p>
<p>The Invincible Broadcasting Studio is organized by the Family Industry Society, call sign XHHE, frequency 940, and opened yesterday. The event was exceptionally wonderful. Fearing overcrowding, the studio declined visits in advance, but there were still more than 300 guests. Mr. Mei Lanfang delivered the opening speech, which read: "Today is the opening date of the Invincible Broadcasting Station. I am honored to be invited by Mr. Chen Xiaodie to say a few words. The Invincible Broadcasting Station was initiated by Mr. Chen of the Family Industry Society. As you all know, since its establishment, the Family Industry Society has manufactured various exquisite daily necessities and cosmetics, which have a wide sales network. It is truly a pioneer and vanguard in promoting national products. Its trademark is called Invincible Brand, and now its goods are indeed popular throughout the country, and it can be said to be invincible in the world. This is truly worthy of the name and a great success. This is also something that you all know. Now, Mr. Chen has founded the Invincible Broadcasting Station, still in the spirit of promoting national products, broadcasting our Mandarin Chinese and our country's inherent dramas, music, and songs to everyone. All the gentlemen and ladies who are responsible for broadcasting are all very famous at the moment. I dare to say that everyone will be very welcome when they hear it in the future. Like the products of the Family Industry Society, it will inevitably be another invincibility in the world. I have finished speaking, and I wish the Invincible Broadcasting Studio great success!" Among the participants in the program, there were Cheng Junmou, Su Shaoqing, and Xia Shanlouzhu for Peking opera; Li Minghui, Wang Renmei, Bai Hong, and Xu Lai for songs. The event ended happily at 12:00 PM. Starting on the 21st, Invincible will officially broadcast, with programs including songs by the Four Heavenly Kings under the guidance of Li Jinhui, the Guanyin opera "Dream of the Red Chamber" by Cang Yinqiu and Yan Hua under the guidance of Chen Dubei, and Peking opera lectures by Jinghu master Sun Zuochen under the guidance of Su Shaoqing. Other programs such as Yang Daoqin's drum music and the part-time teaching of Ms. Cai, a graduate of Pingda, are all sought after by ordinary radio stations, but they cannot be recruited. Moreover, the radio waves are high and exceptionally clear. Even those far away in Fujian and Guangdong can listen to the wonderful performances. Calling it invincible, who would say it is inappropriate?</p>
<h3>Harassment by Refugees Passing Through</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, 160-170 refugees, both men and women, old and young, from Woyang County, Anhui Province, led by refugee leaders Zhu Jicai, Wu Shouyun, Yang Hairu, etc., passed through Zhou Shen Lane in Hongqiao Town, Shanghai West, and stayed at the Xiaozhapeng Temple. Yesterday morning, they continued to walk east on Zhongshan Road, passing Xietu Road. However, in each village they passed through, the refugees extorted from door to door, and all the chickens and ducks were captured. The villagers could not bear the disturbance and reported to the police station in charge. Later, the Public Security Bureau and the Security Corps dispatched corps police to the scene to suppress them. The group then went east towards Gaochangmiao.</p>

<p>Joint Order from the Ministry of Railways</p>
<h3>Strict Inspection of Packages</h3>
<p>To Prevent Smugglers from Transporting Drugs</p>
<p>Special Attention Should Be Paid to Intermodal Packages</p>
<p>In order to facilitate merchants and increase business, the Ministry of Railways does not inspect intermodal packages in transit according to regulations. Currently, drugs are rampant in the Luoyang-Tongguan area of Western Henan. Investigation has shown that their origin is mostly from Shanghai. The Ministry of Railways is deeply concerned that unscrupulous people may use the name of intermodal packages to smuggle drugs. According to transportation industry sources, in order to curb the source of drugs and protect the reputation and business of the railways, the Ministry has specially ordered all intermodal routes to strictly inspect intermodal packages when receiving them at the originating and destination stations, and to investigate the nature of the packages and the transportation situation. In the future, if drugs are found and it is proven that they were transported by rail, the personnel at the originating and destination stations will be severely punished without leniency. It is also known that the Ministry of Railways considers the Shanghai Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to be an important market for import and export goods, and there are many malpractices. It has ordered the two railway administrations to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Woman Dies Tragically from Abortion</h3>
<p>Her Lover Has Disappeared</p>
<p>Abortion Offender Arrested and Prosecuted</p>
<p>Yang Zhang, a woman from Changshu, is 39 years old this year. She was betrothed to someone in her hometown early on, but because her fiancé suffered from dementia, she was unwilling to marry and came to Shanghai to work as a helper. At her employer's home, she met Yang Er, a man from Haimen (45 years old), who was also working there. The two fell in love and rented a house together, living together for more than ten years. Their love was strong, and they had eight children, four of whom died young. The four surviving children are Jin Sheng, the eldest son, 12 years old, Ai Zhen, the second daughter, 9 years old, Ai Di, the third daughter, 7 years old, and Ai Mei, the youngest daughter, 5 years old. Yang Er recently changed his profession to ship steward and has been away from home for more than a year. He still sends living expenses to Ms. Yang and the children every month without interruption. However, because Yang's ship travels to foreign ports and has no fixed location, there is no mailing address. Recently, Ms. Yang led the children to live in Shanghai, and felt lonely and unaccustomed to sleeping alone. Half a year ago, she became acquainted with Wu Laosan from Chongming and lived with him. Fearing gossip from the neighbors, she moved to the back building of Gu Jinyuan's house at No. 185 Renshou Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, on September 27 of last year. Her lover Wu Laosan often stayed at her place. The landlord and neighbors thought they were a couple and did not bother to ask the details. Recently, after Ms. Yang lived with Wu, she became pregnant. Fearing that she would give birth when her husband returned, she would have no face to explain. On the evening of the 17th of this month, she hired an abortionist, Ms. Mou, and two other women to come to her home to perform an abortion. Unexpectedly, the medicine was too strong, and after the fetus was aborted, the bleeding did not stop. She died on the evening of the 19th. At that time, her son Jin Sheng and three daughters were playing outside, and the neighbors and the landlord did not know of her death because she had concealed the abortion. It was not until 7:15 PM that her son Jin Sheng returned home and knocked on the door, but his mother did not respond. He then discovered that she had died. The landlord explained the reason to the children. Because the matter was serious and there were no family elders, he immediately reported it to the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Based on the children's testimony, the abortionist was arrested. Her lover Wu Laosan could not be arrested because his address was unknown. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Forensic Center. Yesterday morning, Wang Ren, prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, and forensic doctor Jiang Xuan, clerk Zhao Yifen, came to the center to perform surgery. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had indeed died from an abortion, with part of the placenta remaining inside and excessive bleeding. After the examination, the case was opened, and Yang Jin Sheng, the son of the deceased, Yang Zhi Shun, the cousin of the deceased's husband, and Gu Jin Yuan, the landlord, were interrogated. It was ruled that Yang Zhang had died from an abortion, and the body was handed over to her family for burial. The abortion offender will be arrested and prosecuted by the police department.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's First Severe Cold</h3>
<p>Lowest Temperature of 23 Degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>After the snowfall two days ago (Thursday), the weather cleared up, but it was very cold. Yesterday was even colder. The Fahrenheit thermometer dropped to 23 degrees. During the day, the northwest wind howled, cutting the face like a knife. Pedestrians and small vendors carrying loads on the street were shivering. In all the corners of houses and roads where there was no sunlight, the ice had not thawed for three days, and the icicles were about a foot long. Small rivers in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Shanghai West were also frozen. It was necessary to light a stove indoors to keep warm. It was the first severe cold since the beginning of winter.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Movement by the Municipal Joint Branch</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that the 34th branch of the First Special District Citizens' Federation held a meeting in Jing'an Temple yesterday. Feng Guangjia, Cai Jiugao, Wang Haochun, Mai Linsheng, Gu Shude, Zhang Beiseng, Wang Jianqing, and others were present. Cai Jiugao was elected as the chairman and Zhang Huihui as the recorder. After the meeting was held as usual, the reports were completed, and the following proposals were discussed: 1) The branch followed the resolution of the Municipal General Assembly to merge the 22nd and 23rd districts and rename them the 34th District Branch, and to proceed according to law. It was resolved to appoint members to re-solicit members. 2) Date for the election. It was resolved to hold it on January 28. 3) Rent reduction proposal. It was resolved that, in accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly and the request of the citizens of the district, a rent reduction movement branch should be established to notify the citizens of the district to register with the branch first for investigation. The notification stated, "To whom it may concern, since the impact of the January 28 incident, the Shanghai market has been sluggish, businesses are in distress, and the livelihood of citizens is difficult to maintain. At a time when prices are falling and rural areas are bankrupt, the high rent in this city remains unchanged. If we do not seek to reduce it, how can we maintain the daily lives of citizens? In order to alleviate the suffering of the people, the Association has launched a rent reduction movement. Therefore, we hereby notify the citizens and shops in this district that all residents and shops on Jing'an Temple Road, Hart Road, Annam Road, Haig Road, Great Western Road, Jessfield Road, Yuyuan Road, Jiaozhou Road, Seymour Road, and other roads should quickly register with the branch at Jing'an Temple Road in order to collect information on the situation of the citizens in this district and make effective preparations. The Association is a citizens' group, based on the duty to protect citizens, and strives to reduce the burden on citizens. We rely on the citizens of this district to unite and work together to achieve practical results."</p>
<p>Intermodal Baggage and Packages</p>
<h3>No Longer Inspected En Route</h3>
<p>Inspected at the Originating or Destination Station</p>
<p>To Avoid Delaying Intermodal Train Schedules</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received an order from the Ministry of Railways stating, "It is hereby ordered to notify you that in accordance with the 6147th order of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Railways reported that the 109th case of the 16th National Intermodal Transportation Conference regarding the inspection of intermodal baggage in transit, which is difficult in many ways, should be improved. It was resolved in the 50th resolution that intermodal baggage and packages should be inspected by the originating or destination station. The Executive Yuan should be requested to issue an order for compliance. As for the special circumstances of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway should request the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction to send a letter to the military and police inspection authorities to send personnel to cross the river for inspection, etc. In view of this, since the inspection of intermodal baggage in transit is difficult and delays the intermodal train schedule, which is inconvenient for passengers, and the inspection at the originating or destination station is already appropriate, there is no need to inspect it en route. In addition to ordering the intermodal transportation office of the Ministry to notify the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to request the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction to send a letter to the military and police inspection authorities to send personnel to cross the river for inspection, we are preparing a document to request the approval of your esteemed court and issue an order for compliance in order to remove difficulties and facilitate passengers, etc. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are hereby ordering you to take note and instruct all subordinates to take note. This order is issued, etc. Therefore, in addition to issuing separate orders to each intermodal route, we are hereby ordering you to comply with this order immediately and instruct all subordinates to comply with this order.

<h3>Returned to Her Mother's Home After Being Abandoned by Her Husband</h3>
<p>A Lawsuit Filed for Indecent Assault</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Retrial and Debate Were Announced</p>
<p>Zhang Yizhen, daughter of Zhang Hanchun from Dongting Mountain, residing at No. 14 Longqing Lane, Ningbo Road, in the Public Concession, is twenty-two years old. Last year, Ye Shaoyun, a relative, twice used deceptive tactics to lure her to the Yuedong Second Inn on Yong'an Street, where he had illicit relations with her, resulting in pregnancy. Several months later, she was married into the He family. After two months of marriage, she gave birth to a son. The He family, considering Zhang's premarital unchastity, sent her back to her mother's home. Later, her father, after investigating and clarifying the matter, acting as her legal guardian, jointly with his daughter, hired lawyer Song Mingxun and submitted a petition to the Second Special District Court, accusing Ye Shaoyun in a criminal self-complaint of luring and having illicit relations with a girl under twenty years old, requesting a trial according to law. After several court hearings and summons, the details were previously reported. However, the presiding judge, Mr. Wu Fanglian, being cautious about the case and seeking detailed information, announced a retrial and debate. Yesterday's summons heard the self-plaintiff's lawyer state, "This case has been tried several times by this court, and the facts are already clear, so there is no need for my lawyer to repeat them. In short, the defendant twice used deceptive tactics to have illicit relations with Zhang Yizhen, which is evidenced by the inn's registration book. The first time, the defendant wrote the name Ye Weijun, and the second time, a Ye surname, with one man and one woman in the room. Afterwards, my lawyer's clerk, Shen Tong, along with Zhu Xiaofeng and Xu Axing, went to the inn to investigate and stamped the book as proof. Although the inn is now closed and the records cannot be subpoenaed, the witnesses have testified without error. In addition, there is a letter from Wang Liangchu, the defendant's maternal uncle, proving everything, and his aunt, Ms. Jiang, also came to the court, proving that the defendant had invited Zhang Yizhen to see a movie twice and the process of negotiating with Ye afterwards. The evidence is solid and undeniable. In addition to requesting a trial according to law, it is requested that the defendants be ordered to compensate for losses of six thousand yuan." The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Shijie, argued, "The self-plaintiff's case is entirely based on empty words and lacks concrete evidence, similar to the recent sensational case in the First Special District Court of Xu Yuying suing Ji Juemi, which was declared innocent due to lack of corroborating evidence. The circumstances of this case are similar and should be declared innocent." Furthermore, the defendant's lawyer, Zhou Yongding, stated, "The self-plaintiff's evidence for the lawsuit relies entirely on Wang Liangchu's letter and the inn's registration book. However, Wang Liangchu's letter was not written by the defendant, and the registration book does not bear the defendant's own name, so how can it be used as evidence? Recently, it has been seen in newspapers that many prosecutions for indecent assault are aimed at extorting money. Since the filing of this lawsuit, the defendant has suffered significant damage to his reputation. It is requested that the case be dismissed and a counterclaim be allowed." The self-plaintiff's lawyer, Song, rose to refute, "According to lawyer Zhang's statement, this case is compared to the Ji Juemi case. It should be known that the Ji case and this case are different. Even though Xu Yuying lost the case, all sectors still rose to help. It cannot be inferred from the Ji case that all other cases should be declared innocent. This is extremely ridiculous." Lawyer Zhang also rose to refute, "Lawyers have the right to speak in court, and the right to judge belongs to the judge. How can lawyer Song attack arbitrarily?" The two sides debated fiercely. As a result, the court announced the end of the debate and ordered a decision to be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Two Fake Checks</p>
<h3>Swindled More Than 130,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Chartered Bank Deceived</p>
<p>A Russian Involved Was Arrested</p>
<p>Among the current account holders of the National Commercial Bank, there is one named [China Tobacco Leaf Company], which was opened by a Westerner and guaranteed by the American firm Pu Xiyang at No. 3 Hankou Road. On the twelfth of this month, the Westerner presented a check No. 979774 issued by the British American Tobacco Company to the China Tobacco Leaf Company for the payment of goods worth 136,688.25 yuan to the Chartered Bank for collection by the National Commercial Bank. The bank, considering that it was already a current account holder, was not in a position to refuse and complied with its request. The bank then obtained the funds from the Chartered Bank and deposited it into the China Tobacco Leaf Company's account. Since then, the Westerner has continuously withdrawn funds from the National Commercial Bank. Within six days, the Westerner withdrew almost all of the money. On the seventeenth, the Westerner again requested the National Commercial Bank to exchange another check. The issuer, the person exchanging the funds, and the purpose of the funds were all the same as before, only the amount was increased to 188,563.2 yuan. The National Commercial Bank suspected the large amount. When the National Commercial Bank inquired of the British American Tobacco Company by telephone, it was late and no conclusion was reached. The next morning, the British American Tobacco Company sent someone to the National Commercial Bank to inspect the check, and it was learned that the check was purely forged. The investigation was then conducted on the check that the Chartered Bank had already paid, and it was also found to be forged. The fraud was then exposed and reported to the police station for investigation. The police authorities then dispatched detectives to investigate. When the Westerner first opened a current account with the National Commercial Bank, it was guaranteed by Pu Xiyang. The police went to Pu Xiyang to inquire of the owner, Mr. Mark. Mr. Mark claimed that he was guaranteed at the request of a Russian employee, Jiao Saifue A'ai Ni, who was employed by him. Mr. Jiao had a monetary relationship with him and had recently given him several checks, all of which had been exchanged for funds, but he still owed him tens of thousands of gold. At this time, the Russian was working in the firm, and the investigators questioned him. The Russian not only denied asking Mark to guarantee the event, but also denied that he had ever given Mark a check. However, the investigators believed that the Russian was highly suspicious and arrested him. They then went to the Russian's residence at No. 455 Lafayette Road in the French Concession and searched it, finding a list of checks, all of which recorded the amount of checks received and paid. The check that Mark said the Russian had paid him was also recorded in it. The investigator also helped bring the suspect back to the police station. Since the China Tobacco Leaf Company was located at No. 14 Jiujiang Road, the police also went to the place to investigate, but there was no such name. Yesterday morning, the Russian was first sent to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan represented the police station to clarify the matter and requested the permission to detain the Russian in order to continue the investigation. After the presiding judge, Qian, briefly interrogated him, he ordered him to be detained pending investigation and further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Please Resolve the Fire Insurance Case in the Disaster Area Quickly</h3>
<p>Ye Jiaxing et al. Submit a Document to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The fire insurance compensation in the Shanghai January 28th disaster area has not yet been resolved by foreign insurance companies. At the representative assembly held by various groups in the city on the 16th of this month, it was resolved to submit a request to the municipal government to expedite the resolution by the Social Affairs Bureau as soon as possible. It is now learned that Ye Jiaxing et al., the presidium of the representative assembly of various groups in Shanghai, have submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday, saying: "The petition is to request the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the fire insurance compensation in the Zhabei disaster area as soon as possible in order to relieve the disaster victims and maintain the people's livelihood. Since the Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association and various groups in the city have been running around and appealing for help, the matter of fire insurance compensation in the Shanghai January 28th disaster area has been negotiated several times and has been nearly two years. On the Chinese insurance industry side, there is a recent saying that various insurance companies will raise 20,000 yuan as relief, but there are thousands of victims in the disaster-stricken areas of Zhabei, Wusong, and Jiangwan. The relief is just a drop in the bucket. What is most abhorrent is that the foreign insurance industry has ignored it and has not expressed any opinion, as if it were not worth mourning for thousands of displaced victims in China. Their disregard for righteousness and their intentions are beyond description. Moreover, at this time of cold weather, heavy snow, and disaster victims have lost their homes and businesses for two years. They are hungry and cold, turning and wailing, waiting to be fed, with no way to heaven and no door to earth. The situation is so bleak and miserable that it is heartbreaking and beyond words to describe. If a solution is not found quickly, the future is dangerous. Therefore, at the representative assembly of various groups on the 16th of this month, it was unanimously resolved to submit a request to your government to expedite the resolution of the fire insurance compensation in the disaster area by the Social Affairs Bureau as soon as possible in order to maintain the livelihoods of the disaster victims. We respectfully submit this document, hoping that your government will review it and expedite the Social Affairs Bureau's efforts to negotiate compensation from foreign insurance companies and to fully resolve the matter in the shortest possible time to relieve the disaster victims and maintain the people's livelihood. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the presidium of the representative assembly of various groups in Shanghai, Ye Jiaxing et al."</p>
<h3>Continued Inquiry into the Death of Three People Falling from an Eight-Story Building</h3>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening Post," an American woman, Ms. Grosso, 43 years old, and her two sons, one 7 years old and one 5 years old, fell to their deaths from the roof of the Washington Apartments at 305 Avenue Petain on Friday evening. This morning (20th), after investigating the cause of their deaths, American Prosecutor Salette reported to American Bailiff Pandy, who will decide whether to examine the bodies. The woman returned to her apartment at 6 p.m. and immediately led her two sons to the roof for a walk. Before long, disaster struck. A chauffeur in the courtyard below the nine-story building witnessed it. He said that the younger child fell first, and then the older child followed immediately. The woman fell last. Grosso happened to be in the apartment and rushed to report it. Grosso immediately notified the American police by telephone. Before long, American police officers arrived, followed by French police officers. The remains of the mother and sons are scheduled to be placed in coffins at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 4 p.m. today. It is learned that the woman arrived in Shanghai only a month ago and was scheduled to return to the United States last night because her father was ill in the United States. Unexpectedly, a few hours before departure, the mother and sons suffered a strange disaster. Alas!</p>
<h3>Commander Thomas of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Resigns</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Sends a Letter Praising His Merits</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the Public Concession, has resigned after completing his term.</p>
<p>He has already handed over his duties. The Municipal Council sent a letter to the colonel yesterday, praising his merits, saying in essence: The commander has worked diligently in the concession for three years. It is regrettable that he cannot continue to serve due to certain reasons. During these three years, the city has experienced the most serious incidents. During the war, and before and after the war, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps assisted in maintaining order in the concession and in defending the borders. The work was difficult, and the reputation was outstanding. The commander's handling and coordination between the Volunteer Corps and the foreign defense forces were appropriate, and the citizens were grateful. Today, on the day of the colonel's departure from Shanghai, the Municipal Council expresses its sincere gratitude and wishes him all the best in the future. It is regrettable that it cannot retain him.</p>
<p>The Fourth Branch of the Municipal Joint Association of the Second Special District</p>
<h3>Sends a Letter Urging the Formation of a Self-Defense Corps</h3>
<p>A Letter Sent to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association Yesterday</p>
<p>The Fourth Branch of the Civic Union of the Second Special District of Shanghai in the French Concession (Nanyang Bridge) sent a letter to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association yesterday, saying: "Dear Sirs, it has been reported that at the Second General Meeting of the Members of our Association, a proposal from the members was discussed. In view of the recent rise of bandits and the repeated occurrence of robberies, during this period of winter defense, it is not enough to maintain security without increasing police force. It was unanimously agreed that the original plan for organizing a civic self-defense corps should be implemented to supplement the inadequacy of the police force. Moreover, it has been found that the Public Concession already has a special police force of Chinese, and since its establishment, its achievements have been remarkable. Although our French Concession had initiated the establishment of a Chinese merchant self-defense corps early on, it was suspended for a long time because it did not obtain the approval of the French authorities, and it fell behind others. Our Association believes that the organization of a self-defense corps is a necessary measure for civic self-defense and that the previous plan should be restored as soon as possible and actively implemented. Therefore, in accordance with the decision of the General Meeting, we hereby request your Association to prepare and establish it as soon as possible, which would be fortunate for the citizens and fortunate for the locality."</p>

Attendees included Li Ting'an, Lai Douyan, Zhu Hengbi, Zhang Wei, Tian Cuibin, Tu Baoluo, and others. Chairman Li Ting'an delivered a speech, saying in essence: "Everyone knows the harm of tuberculosis. More than one million people in China are sacrificed each year due to lack of common sense and being attacked by tuberculosis bacteria. The decline of our nation is mainly due to tuberculosis. We cannot bear to sit idly by and watch it become increasingly rampant and cause significant losses to society. Therefore, we do not hesitate to shout loudly to arouse social attention and maintain social health and well-being. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved without the joint efforts of all members of society. This is why we have established the Anti-Tuberculosis Association as a place for collecting ideas and expanding knowledge." Then, Dr. Lai Douyan gave a speech, saying that tuberculosis in our country has become a very serious problem. If we do not take precautions, the harm will be unimaginable. Now, leaders from all walks of life have organized an Anti-Tuberculosis Association to awaken the people, so we deeply hope that you will assist us and join us in support. Then, Dr. Zhang Wei gave a speech, saying that the number of people in our country suffering from tuberculosis is the highest in the world. The loss of talents and the waste of treatment costs far exceed the annual civil war. We should pay attention to personal and public hygiene to prevent the recurrence of tuberculosis. Then, Zhang Junjun, the executive director of the association, reported on the association's work. Immediately afterwards, Wu Zenggui of Kodak Company showed an anti-tuberculosis film. At around 6 o'clock, everyone dispersed happily.</p>

<p>Police Station</p>
<h3>Uncovers a Large-Scale Morphine Organization</h3>
<p>Seized Countless Drugs and Machines</p>
<p>Zhang Zhenggao from Ningbo, who lives at No. 15 Baolin Lane, Avenue Edward VII, recently rented a three-story Western-style house at No. 12, Lane 456, Route Foch, and invested tens of thousands of yuan to establish a large-scale morphine manufacturing plant. He secretly sold it to various ports inside and outside the city and made a lot of profit. The police authorities were unable to find out. At about 3 a.m. yesterday morning, Chinese detectives Wang Runhe and Wang Guangqi, and Western detective Ge Lang, from the Hongkou Police Station, were searching pedestrians in the vicinity of Hansbury Road when they saw Jiang Jindao from Tongzhou, who looked suspicious. They stopped him and found a small bag of morphine on him. After questioning, they learned that it was bought from the plant. They secretly went to the address and broke in. They arrested workers Tang Ajin and the maid Chen Jishi. They also went to Zhang Zhenggao's house and arrested his son Zhang Agen and his wife Chen Zhangshi. They searched and found two account books and learned that there was a shareholder, Yu Axian from Ningbo, who was hiding at No. 1 Tongfu Lane. They also went to arrest him and brought all the manufacturing machines, various chemical equipment, nine taels of heroin, white powder and gray medicine, cars, and chartered cars from the plant to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. It is also heard that the two famous morphine kings, Sun and Gao, who invested in the plant, are both on the run.</p>
<p>Asia Hotel</p>
<h3>A Traveler Dies Tragically From Poison</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon (the 18th), a traveler arrived at the Asia Hotel at 255 Hankou Road. He claimed to be Wang Zhong, 28 years old, from Nanjing. The tea boy led him to room 192, and he paid a room fee of three yuan. When he went to bed that night, he told the tea boy to wake him up at twelve o'clock the next morning. The tea boy agreed and left. By lunchtime yesterday, he still hadn't gotten up. The tea boy called out to him several times from outside the room, but there was no response. Suspicions arose, and he managed to pry open the door. He saw that the man's expression had changed drastically, his eyes were fixed, and his mouth was agape. He reported this to the accounting room, which in turn reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. An ambulance was used to</p>
<p>transport him to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinsheng Falsely Reports Being Kidnapped, Acquitted</h3>
<p>There Is Indeed a Pitiful Aspect</p>
<p>The Law Should Consider Human Sentiment</p>
<p>Zhang Jinsheng, a local resident who used to be a comprador for the French military camp in Shanghai, was recently under economic pressure and unable to pay his debts to various merchants on time. He falsely claimed that on the eighth of this month, he was kidnapped by bandits on the Bund outside Renji Road, detained for four days, and then thrown into a small river in Hongqiao. Later, Chief Inspector Li Yidong and Investigator Zhang Xiaolin of the General Police Station found that this was a fabrication. They detained Zhang and charged him with falsely reporting a crime. The case had already been preliminarily heard by the First Special Court, as detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday, the case was examined again by Judge Feng. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case and stated that the judge of the Summary Court believed that the defendant had also committed the crime of embezzlement, but after investigation by the police, there was no evidence of embezzlement. When questioned, Zhang Jinsheng confessed, "Several years ago, my family suffered a series of deaths, as many as six people, which led to a lot of debt. Later, I remarried, and because I was afraid of losing face, I never mentioned the debt. This month, I was under pressure from old debts, so I used the 2,400 yuan that should have been paid to the merchants to repay the old debts. Fearing that the merchants would demand payment, I came up with a plan to falsely claim that I had been kidnapped and robbed of a large sum of money, thinking that this would allow me to ask the merchants</p>
<p>for a one-month extension. I didn't know that this was an illegal act. It was really because I was simple-minded and wanted to save face. Moreover, my family of several people all rely on me for their livelihood. When the police investigated me later, I immediately confessed. I beg the court to be lenient." As he spoke, he wept bitterly, which moved everyone who heard him. Then, the police lawyer Li stated, "Looking at the defendant's actions, this crime was committed out of necessity and is a first offense. I ask the court to handle it leniently." Finally, after Zhang's lawyer, Fan Gang, defended the defendant, Judge Feng asked Inspector Li whether Zhang had confessed in the police station. Li replied yes. Judge Feng then announced that Zhang Jinsheng was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Prices Rise Due to Cold Weather</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the severe cold weather in this city, the supply of vegetables from various small vegetable fields</p>
<p>is lacking, so the prices of all vegetables have risen one after another.

<h3>Destroying a Younger Brother's Belongings</h3>
<p>The Xu Family Has Many Troubles</p>
<p>The Culprit Detained and Sent for Investigation</p>
<p>Dong Xu, an old woman from Wuxi, 59 years old, has two sons, the elder named Shunfa, 31 years old, and the younger named Shunzheng, 28 years old. The two brothers had already separated and established their own households. The old woman was supported by Shunzheng, and they lived together on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai. Shunzheng was engaged in peddling, barely making a living. The elder son, Shunfa, had recently been idle and had difficulty making a living, so he accumulated a mountain of debt. He had previously forced his younger brother to borrow 60 yuan, and not only had he not returned it, but he had also gone to his younger brother's place the other day, aggressively demanding to borrow several tens of yuan. Shunzheng refused, saying that his business had been slow recently and he really had no spare money to lend. Unexpectedly, Shunfa, unable to get what he wanted, dared to hide a sharp blade and resort to violence, completely destroying all the utensils and sundries in his younger brother's house. Shunzheng allowed him to run rampant, otherwise he would have been poisoned. The old mother, seeing his unlawful and disobedient behavior, went out and called the police, who arrested him and took him to the Sixth District. After an interrogation by the district officials, he was immediately escorted to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Su Mao Nü Never Returned</p>
<h3>The Husband Searched Everywhere Without Success</h3>
<p>Advertisement for Information, Reward of 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Su Mao Nü, a woman from Huangdu, 21 years old, is quite beautiful and is known as Mei Lanfang's A Qi. In September, she was married to Xu Qingxiang, a man from Ningbo, through a matchmaker. The couple's relationship was quite harmonious. Xu lived at 42 Hongfu Lane, North Nicheng Bridge. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 17th, Su suddenly ran away without telling anyone. Xu searched everywhere, but to no avail. According to Mr. Xu, his wife was wearing a green small round-patterned rainforest silk camel-hair cheongsam, a blue cloth jacket, black leather shoes, plain brown felt shoes, a white-painted face, permed hair, and gold teeth inlaid in her mouth, one gold and one emerald. She speaks with a local accent. The reason for her departure must have been instigated by someone. In addition to reporting to the police for investigation, he is also placing an advertisement for information. Anyone who knows her whereabouts and sends her back will be rewarded with 100 yuan. Those who provide information will be rewarded with 50 yuan. The funds are set aside and will definitely</p>
<p>be honored.</p>

<p>▲Victory Brand Embroidery Glue Establishes Overseas Distribution Outlets Reciprocity is the only key to our dealings with the world. However, the selection of gifts should first and foremost be novel and ingenious, not falling into the traps of predecessors, in order to win the recipient's favor. In the past, embroidery once seized considerable authority in the gift industry. Since the rise of science, this embroidery has been declining day by day. After the Victory brand embroidery glue came out, because the color of the glue is bright and eye-catching, and it does not change over time, it is incomparable to embroidery, which fades after washing. Moreover, it is cheap and saves time, and the drawing method is extremely easy, which embroidery cannot hope to match. Therefore, it seized the position of embroidery and replaced it. Although it has not been a year since its advent, it has become popular throughout the country. Even people in Europe and America are amazed and happy to use it. The general manager's office of Dahua Trading Company, 617 on the sixth floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road, previously published an advertisement inviting out-of-town managers.

In this city, exclusive sales agreements have been signed with the three major companies, Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun, and the China National Goods Company. According to the daily reports from various distributors, the daily sales revenue of the glue averages about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. As the Spring Festival is approaching, which is the time for people from all walks of life to give gifts, it is expected that the sales of the glue will be even more amazing.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>▲Russian Thief Steals Two Pieces of Lun Xianchun The Dacheng Silk Shop inside Xiaodongmen has a prosperous business on weekdays. At about 5 p.m. yesterday, just as buyers were crowded, four foreigners suddenly broke into the shop, dressed gorgeously and looking like upper-class figures, and mingled with the customers. After a while, they left without buying anything. The shop's staff noticed that the coat worn by one of the foreigners suddenly bulged, and he looked flustered, which was very suspicious. They immediately went forward and grabbed him. Upon searching, they found that his coat contained two pieces of Xianchun thread placed in the window of the shop. At this point, the shop realized that the foreigner was a thief. The remaining three foreigners, seeing that the matter had been exposed, ran away. The shop's staff immediately chased them out and captured one person, along with the foreigner who had the stolen goods. They handed them over to Wang Mengsong, the guard policeman in that area, and took them to the first precinct's second station.

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Reading Plan (2)</h3>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. He Yongquan… (continued)</p>
<p>It is most correct to study theory starting from practice. But this doesn't mean that you have no discernment at all, and don't need to diligently read a few original theoretical books, only needing to read one or two pamphlets or one or two short articles in a certain magazine to obtain knowledge. Of course, we don't have much time to read lengthy specialized works, but sometimes there's still no way, and we have to do a hard reading like you did before. But you shouldn't think that putting effort into a few big books is boring, an academic attitude, or divorced from practice. Just the opposite: as long as you read [theory] to understand practice, don't leave practice, and constantly pay attention to current facts, then you will have achieved a coordination of theory and practice. We can't be too biased towards formal mechanization. So, of course we can comply with your request at the end of your letter to provide you with some research materials. As for the theoretical part, we still hope you will deepen your own study.</p>
<p>Processing materials from newspapers is also very difficult. It could become a separate discussion. Modern newspapers are the spokespersons of power, a means of controlling power consciousness. It's really not enough for you to read just one or two newspapers. However, within the scope of your economic and time constraints, there's naturally nothing to be done about it. However, you should read with an objective attitude and not overly believe that everything said above is the truth. As for how to read newspapers, we plan to produce a separate pamphlet, so we won't elaborate here.</p>
<p>Regarding your plan's execution time, we still have some doubts. It seems that your hopes are too great, and the time is so tight, that it may be beyond your ability to handle! Can you scale down the plan a bit, or not start from the international level, but from a certain part that is more in line with your living environment? This doesn't mean that you have to overturn the entire plan, but rather to implement your plan in stages.</p>
<p>Also, we have long been concerned about the difficulty of reading the great works on [theory], and are now planning to compile and print popular versions of famous works. However, we can't say at this moment when they will be published.</p>
<p>In summary: after you receive this letter, it's best to do another check and make it more practical, so that it can be 100% realized. Your goal is very correct. Regarding the direction of academic ability, it's best to prepare and make an appointment to come to our office for a personal discussion. In addition, please pay attention, friends other than Mr. He, and welcome new opinions to join. 丨丨丨Respectfully</p>

<p>As for the career paths of graduates from departments such as Arts and Law, the majority have to rely on the government to accommodate them. In order to select genuine talent, purify officialdom, and ensure social security, the government should strictly implement the civil service examination system. The current higher-level Second Examinations, held once every two years, are still not frequent enough. They should be held every year to give outstanding university graduates ample opportunities to serve. The current practice of relying heavily on recommendation letters for hiring people in various institutions is really not a good phenomenon. It has come to the point where insignificant people like me don't know how many recommendation letters they have to write in a year. Even though it's known to be useless, the people who want the letters still insist that you write them. This is because there is no definite method for the government to promote and advance people. As a result, those seeking jobs regard a piece of eight-line stationery as the ultimate truth. Those who can't find anyone else find me, which is truly terrible. In Western countries, the employment of civil servants generally has a definite system, with the systems in England and France being the best. The United States used to have a very chaotic civil service. In the nineteenth century, U.S. President Jackson publicly acknowledged that the civil service system at the time was a spoils system, and even defended this system, saying that it was very good because it could rotate political power and avoid stagnation. As a result, whenever political parties alternated, regardless of right or wrong, they would dismiss all the old members of the opposing party. Politics became a roulette game, and the impact was naturally extremely bad. Later, there was a movement in society for many years, with former President Roosevelt being particularly diligent. As a result, the civil service examination system was gradually adopted. It is said that there are currently about 600,000 civil servants in the U.S. federal government, of whom 450,000 were employed after passing examinations. There are still 150,000 people who are inevitably affected by changes in political parties. However, in France and England, cabinet changes only involve the replacement of a few ministers, and the staff below have absolutely no risk of being transferred. Therefore, no matter how many times the cabinet is reorganized, politics will never be chaotic. Speaking of China, it's like "a new emperor, a new courtier." Without a piece of eight-line stationery, you can't get an appointment letter, which is truly laughable. Everyone must recognize that establishing a definite civil service examination system is a prerequisite for purifying officialdom. In fact, 95% of the people admitted to the first Higher Education Entrance Examination already have real positions, and the people admitted to the second examination have also been assigned. However, I always feel that the general public still hasn't reached the level of enthusiasm that they should have for the Higher Education Entrance Examination. The people of the country haven't established a belief in examinations. People who have other lucky paths to take still take the lucky paths and are unwilling to mutter and mumble, starting from the third examination. This is all because they fear that after passing the examination, the government won't be able to place them and they will be assigned to various institutions to sit on the sidelines. However, the government also feels the same difficulty. If hiring one hundred people requires adding one hundred officials, wouldn't more and more people being admitted to the Higher Education Entrance Examination mean that there are more and more government officials and the burden on the common people is heavier? In order to establish everyone's belief in examinations and to truly purify officialdom, I believe that at the time of each Higher Education Entrance Examination or General Examination, the existing civil servants of various institutions must be selected for examination. At least 5% or 10% of the total number of civil servants in each institution should be selected for examination each time, which will not hinder the progress of the agency's affairs. If you pass, you will be allowed to return to your position and given an additional guarantee. If you don't pass, you will be replaced by newly admitted people. In this way, not only will the people of the whole country have a firm belief in the examination system, but the current civil servants will also be vigilant, constantly study, and not leave their studies. Useless personnel will dismiss themselves even if they are not dismissed. If things proceed in such a systematic way, it will naturally be possible to establish a Chinese civil service employment system within ten or twenty years, and it will be able to unfold hope for young people, maintain fairness for society, and indirectly promote the development of university education. The relationship is truly not superficial. Otherwise, relying solely on eight-line stationery to employ officials will mean that officialdom will never be pure and politics will never be on the right track.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the people of the whole country will recognize that if university education is to be operated, it should be approached with an attitude of love and support. In particular, we must absolutely not exploit young people. Everyone must know that exploiting immature youth is tantamount to destroying the vitality of the country and the nation, because young people's time is very short and precious. We must not let them waste it. We must never give them impure impressions, and we must fully cultivate their personalities and give them noble ideals, so that they can see the light of the future. We must not fill their minds with low-level materialistic ideas and the thought of abandoning learning and seeking a way out through luck. This would be severing the line of life in their future, and the vitality of the country would suffer immeasurable losses as a result. We must know that what China needs from now on is not people who run around holding meetings, with petty wisdom, selfishness, and a desire to exert their own petty leadership, but rather people who are calm and steady, have specialized intelligence, and are truly impartial and selfless in serving the country and society through practical legislation. Only with such people can China's problems be solved. Even if we ourselves cannot see China's revitalization and strength, we must still hope that the next generation can see it. (End)</p>

<p>The Fourth Plenary Session Opens</p>
<h3>Shanghai Education Circles Issue Declaration</h3>
<p>▲International situation is increasingly contradictory, with powder kegs everywhere</p>
<p>▲Second World War is on the verge of breaking out</p>
<p>▲China's survival hinges on whether it can save itself today</p>
<p>▲The plenary session should focus on discussing how to cope with extraordinary times</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of University and College Faculty and Staff, the Federation of University and College Students, the Federation of Secondary School Faculty and Staff, and the Federation of Secondary School Students, for the Fourth Plenary Session, which is opening in Nanjing at a time of serious national crisis, have jointly issued an important declaration, presenting their proposals for saving the country. The original text of the declaration is extracted below. The country is in great trouble, to an extreme degree. Internally, the Red Bandits are rampant. Externally, the powerful bandits are invading. The foundation of the country is in danger and cannot last. The central government, in order to coordinate the overall plan for saving the country and to avert the crisis, is convening the Fourth Plenary Session in the capital. With the far-sightedness of the central committee members, we are confident that they will be able to lift the net and work towards this goal. However, we, on behalf of all university faculty and staff, all university students, all Chinese faculty and staff, and all secondary school students in the city, still have something to contribute to the attendees. Now, at the beginning of 1934,</p>
<p>▲The international situation's complexity and contradictions are even worse than at this time last year. It is also closer to the so-called extraordinary crisis of 1936 than in the past. In the Far East, since Japan trampled on the Northeast and withdrew from the League of Nations, its diplomacy has fallen into isolation day by day. Hirota's ascension to power still cannot break the diplomatic deadlock. However, the domestic political struggles have become even more acute as a result. Therefore, those in power have no choice but to pay more attention to foreign affairs and shift the public's attention to the international arena. Looking back at the universe, the United States and Russia are the two powers of the world, and also Japan's major enemies. If it can defeat one of them, it will not be difficult to dominate the world. However, the United States' power in the Pacific should not be ignored. Moreover, Russia is a socialist country. If it wages war against it, it will instead gain the understanding of the capitalist powers and reduce Japan's external difficulties. Therefore, its recent actions towards Soviet Russia have progressed from harassing the Middle East Railway to attempts at military espionage. As for Soviet Russia, although it is burying itself in the Second Five-Year Plan, its deployment of 250,000 troops on the Amur border, the gathering of 450 aircraft between Vladivostok and Shuangchengzi, and the construction of large-scale scale-shaped fortifications on its border adjacent to northern Manchuria all show its preparations for engaging and welcoming the enemy. Since the "Hishikari Document" was announced, the sky over the Far East has become even more obscured by haze.</p>
<p>▲A Japanese-Russian war is on the verge of breaking out. This powder keg in the Far East has already been safely buried, but it is only a matter of time before it explodes. In Western Europe, since Japan announced its withdrawal, the League of Nations has been no different from being afflicted with hemiplegia. And this paralyzed organ has been rendered moribund by one of Hitler's bombs. The Disarmament Conference has only become a stage for countries to perform comedies of contradictions. Those who criticize it as being an army university for discussing war tactics are right on the mark. Other issues, such as the war debt problem, although known to be "cancer of the world economy," still have no solution to date. In this situation of chaos like tangled silk, the conflict of interests between countries has reached an irreconcilable point. All those within the Versailles system are expanding their armaments like madmen to seek their so-called "security guarantees." Those who oppose this system, although they do not have the freedom to openly expand their armaments due to treaty constraints,</p>
<p>▲are also sharpening their swords and feeding their horses in secret, not just for one day. Since Hitler's rise on the German political stage, his actions have further stirred up waves in the international arena and caused the crisis before 1914 to reappear today. This situation in Western Europe, where powder kegs are everywhere, is a fact that is presented to us and cannot be denied. Looking at the unpredictable changes in the situation in the Far East and the tense international situation, the outbreak of the Second World War is indeed not just speculation, and the so-called extraordinary crisis of 1936 is certainly not unexpected. Then what will a world war leave to our nation? If we are able to strive to become strong, then even if three households of Qin were destroyed, it would not be difficult to rise to the path of rejuvenation. Otherwise, if we live in a drunken dream and die, there will be no survival, and we will inevitably move towards the path of destruction. Therefore, whether the world war is a disaster or a blessing, a gain or a loss for us depends on whether we can, from now on,</p>
<p>▲consciously save ourselves and make a judgment. There is no other way to consciously save ourselves, but to get everyone to recognize the trend of the unfolding of this world's extraordinary times and to spare no effort to make the struggle that we should have in extraordinary times. This especially requires those in power to first have a comprehensive and specific plan, and then provide the people with a common path to work towards. Otherwise, everyone will tend to their own preferences and do what they think is right. If the steps are not consistent, how can the forces be concentrated? Is it possible to extricate oneself from danger and get through the great disaster of the coming days? Now that the Fourth Plenary Session has gathered the wise and talented people of the party and the country in one hall, the forces and talents that it has gathered are naturally greater and broader than usual. And the past rifts between the parties due to differences in political views have already felt the necessity of mutual forbearance and sincere unity for the sake of the country, and will be dissolved in the same furnace of this Fourth Plenary Session. Then its plan to cope with the great policy of this world's extraordinary times is even more of a possibility. However, time waits for no one, and the opportunity is urgent. Try to do hundreds and thousands of things in one day. Whether it will be effective is still a question. If there is even a slight delay, destruction can be expected immediately. Therefore,</p>
<p>▲what we hope from the Fourth Plenary Session is that all the issues discussed should take the suppression of bandits and rebels and national defense construction as the highest standard, and coping with this world's extraordinary times as the only center. If we abandon this and talk about other things, touch on branches, like a person who wants to arrange everything nicely when it is already late, and miss the opportunity, no matter what its intentions are, it would simply be obliterating the interests of the country, ruining the fate of the nation, and ultimately becoming a disaster for the party and the country, and a sinner in the autumn. The survival of our Chinese nation will be tied to this Fourth Plenary Session, and the success or failure of the meeting will be tied to whether it can concentrate its efforts to plan for this extraordinary period and enable the whole country to be prepared to catch up quickly. The times are difficult and the responsibility is heavy. We hope that the attendees will consider this.</p>

<p>Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<h3>Subsidies for Private Schools Will Be Distributed</h3>
<p>In order to assist the development of private schools already registered in the city, the Municipal Education Bureau originally provided subsidies. Since the number of registered schools has increased from 1933, the subsidy regulations have been revised and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. A committee for subsidizing private schools has been organized to investigate, assess the performance and needs of the schools, determine the amount of the subsidy, and specify the purpose. After receiving the funds, each school must submit a final account for reimbursement at the end of the year. The Education Bureau has now issued orders to various schools. Those that were originally subsidized and continue to be allocated subsidies will be issued funds starting from August 1933. Schools that have been newly approved for subsidies will be issued funds starting from January 1934. The above-mentioned measures take into account both the finances of the municipal treasury and the needs of the various schools. It is also heard that the subsidies for August and September will be issued first to the originally subsidized schools, and will be distributed starting on the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>East China Christian</p>
<h3>中華失敗反常奇異P]</h3>
<p>中華's failure is not from lack of effort, but from poor fortune. On the same field unsuitable for combat, first-rate players met ordinary talents. Skills they usually excel at, like shooting, passing, and tackling, all failed. A tiger fallen into the plains, a hero losing his power – how could this not be strange? Regardless of whether it's Donghua or Youyou from Group A, or any team from Jinan, they usually defeat Group B's Jewish team with ease. But yesterday, against the concentrated talent of the Chinese team, they unexpectedly suffered defeat. A thousand and ten thousand years from now, this should be considered an oddity.</p>
<p>Jewish Effort, Endless Hope</p>
<p>The Chinese had more shooting opportunities than the enemy. However, the grass was soft like cotton, making it difficult to exert force. Long shots were unsuitable, and close kicks were often blocked, leading to repeated failures. A momentary lapse allowed the Jewish team to capitalize. The Jewish goalkeeper, Wei Tuolai, was diligent, single-handedly blocking attacks under iron hooves. His great achievements maintained their chastity, making him the Jewish team's greatest hero.</p>
<p>The two inner guards were as hard as iron, preventing entry no matter how many troops or horses. The central defensive line monitored separately, nullifying the effectiveness of the Chinese wings. The only attacking method for the Jewish forwards was to exploit China's overextension, with the entire army advancing and leaving the interior empty. Their one-goal victory was based on this, securing their place in the finals and endless hope for the future.</p>
<p>Overwhelming Strength Met Enemy Calculation</p>
<p>The Chinese faced the wind and sun, progressing with the opening kick straight towards the opponent's goal. The Jewish defenders, initially facing a formidable enemy, panicked. Relying on divine assistance, they narrowly escaped. The Chinese forwards gained momentum, with the inner guards advancing to the center line for support. At that moment, the Jewish fate seemed to be in the hands of the five Chinese forwards. However, shots missed their mark, and soon fortune turned.</p>
<p>In the peaceful Chinese territory, the Jewish team suddenly invaded. Tuodeman acted strangely on the right flank, with Bielindi responding remotely in the center. Moving from right to left, then left to center in the blink of an eye, Zhou Xianyan was trapped. L. Green burst forth with a shot, which Zhou parried not far enough. Another kick resulted in a score, marking a failure due to ill timing and lost opportunities.</p>
<p>Lost One Goal, Unconcerned</p>
<p>The Chinese were unconcerned about losing a goal because, at all times and places, Chinese athletes are usually one step ahead. Afterwards, Chen Jiaqiu got a pass from Sun Jinshun. Lin Jing was about to contribute when Yi Chen was ruled offside, negating the play. Xu Yahui, on the right wing, was unaccustomed to his position, often moving to the center and competing with Feng Yunyou for the ball. The Jewish left wing was unguarded, allowing great activity. Tu Biyuan also lost his defensive focus. As a result, when the enemy attacked, Li Jiang and other generals found it difficult to cope.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Jiaqiu still thought of advancing through close combat. Qiong Sheng momentarily lost focus, and the ball flew into the heart of the territory again. Dai Zhongjun was unstable and shot weakly, allowing Wei Tuolai to catch it easily. However, Green was a dangerous man, deeply penetrating Chinese territory. He raised his foot to shoot, but Zhou Xianyan scooped it up. Li Ning kicked a corner, which the Jewish team failed to capitalize on.</p>
<p>Looking back, Xianghua passed to the front of the goal. Qiong Sheng and Lansiting were both blocked by Li Sun, unable to break free. Chen Jiaqiu, in the best position, hesitated with the ball, allowing Gao Fei to turn back and resolve the crisis. Ten men fought hard to maintain their lead.</p>
<p>Ten Men Hard-Fought Victory</p>
<p>Time flies, and in a blink, the first half passed. In the second half, the Chinese team intended to retaliate with relentless attacks. The Jewish team divided their forces for defense while seizing opportunities to attack. Jiang Shanjing missed a kick, nearly causing disaster. Wan Xianghua was always able to fulfill his mission, sending the ball to the center whenever there was a good opportunity. Sun Jinshun struck with an iron leg, but the shot was caught by the enemy defender.</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu took a corner, but the defense cleared it. Xu Yahui shot with all his strength, but the ball went high, failing to score. Chen Jiaqiu fueled the fire. Dai was in a sea of horses, sweeping the ball across the field, but the shot was deflected by the goalpost. Li Yichen took the rebound and shot again, but Qiong Sheng blocked it with his knee. The Jewish Gao Fei was injured and rested, leaving ten men to defend.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sun Jinshun made his third attempt. Amidst a sea of players, the ball rolled from below. The Jewish goalkeeper managed to catch it, and those in the know realized that China was doomed to defeat. Afterwards, the Chinese team launched several more attacks, but all failed. Li Ning was also sent off the field, indicating worsening circumstances. Soon, the game ended, with China losing 1-0.</p>
<p>▲ Jewish Team: Gao Fei, L. Green, Qiong Sheng, S. Green, Wei Tuolai, H. Green, Bielindi, Hao Lansiting, Tang Qie, G. Green, Tuodeman</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Team: Tu Kaiyuan, Wan Xianghua, Li Ning, Li Yichen, Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Dai Linjing, Jiang Shanjing, Sun Jinshun, Xu Yahui, Chen Jiaqiu</p>

<p>West YMCA Basketball Situation Gradually Intensifies</p>
<p>▲ Group A's Ever-Victorious Sea Pirates and McLain Finals on the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ Each Section of Group B Has Concluded, with Three Teams Scheduled to Compete for Supremacy</p>
<p>▲ The Women's Group Championship Is Inevitably Contested by the Two Jiangnan Women's Teams</p>
<p>Last night, in West YMCA basketball, all three Group A matches were one-sided. McLain remained undefeated, decisively defeating John. In the other two groups, Shanghai defeated Jiangwan, and Allied defeated Jinan. There were also two Group B matches: Shanghai Middle School defeated Philippine Overseas Chinese, and Army Officer defeated Taxation Specialist. The results of the five groups are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Middle School Wins Philippine Overseas Chinese B3 36 to 16</p>
<p>(2) Army Officer Wins Taxation Specialist B3 30 to 16</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Wins Jiangwan Group A 59 to 31</p>
<p>(4) McLain Wins John Group A 58 to 25</p>
<p>(5) Allied Wins Jinan Group A 53 to 33</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Wins Jiangwan</p>
<p>Jiangwan's key players were absent last night, with Zhou Da and Zhao Bu Tian both missing. Facing Shanghai without them was naturally difficult. Shanghai's Feng Nianhua and Qian Yong were agile and lively, taking the lead all the way. In the first half, the score was 25 to 10. Jiangwan's only noteworthy player was Zhang Jinxiang, who was penalized out at 54 to 23. Jiangwan was unable to shoot, and Shanghai's shooting skills also declined significantly; otherwise, the score would have been much higher.</p>

<p>▲ McLain Wins John</p>
<p>It was difficult for John to defeat the tall, strong, fierce McLain. However, although John lost, they played commendably, defending diligently. Ge Zhengdao's performance was satisfactory. In the first half, McLain won with 31 to 13, a difference of 18 points. In the second half, John's long shots earned applause, narrowing the gap to 34 to 23. However, ultimately, they lacked strength, and McLain continued their fierce advance, defeating John with 58 to 25.</p>

<p>▲ Allied Wins Jinan</p>
<p>Allied's shooting last night was miraculous. Chen Xianglong and Xu Kepei penetrated every opening, astonishing Jinan, whose hands and feet were flustered, losing their usual form and collapsing. After 6 to 2 in the first half, Allied scored six consecutive points, making it 12 to 2. From then on, they overwhelmed Jinan. However, the score difference in the first half was not more than ten points. After 30 to 20 in the second half, the gap widened, and Allied ultimately won with 53 to 33.</p>

<p>Long and Steady Gold Market</p>
<p>▲ Conflicting Foreign Reports, Complex Process</p>
<p>The gold market was stable yesterday, with many twists and turns during the half-day. Overseas news was complicated, but people's minds were stable. Large accounts continued to cover short positions. Although there were rumors in the market of price increases favoring the long side, this was just minority sentiment and unlikely to have a special impact. The trend is firm, and the long side currently appears risk-free.</p>
<p>In the morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and the US rose. However, on the Gold Exchange, futures silver prices, except for March, which rose by 5 hao, all fell by 5 hao to 1 li. Exchange rates uniformly increased. The initial quoted price dropped to 82.3 yuan, but with active buying, large accounts such as Dadecheng, Huixiang, and Hongxing all entered. Reuters reported that Yang Ge, President of the US Boston Bank, told the Senate Banking Committee that the devaluation of the US dollar could not be implemented until an agreement was reached with Britain and France, and Senator Glass also declared that the Treasury's confiscation of Federal Bank gold reserves was illegal, sparking an upward trend. By the time the market opened in the morning, it had already broken through 90 yuan. After the opening, the banks pushed up, and gold prices rose further. However, Reuters reported that the dollar devaluation would be discussed and that someone was urging its quick discussion, which again pushed prices down. After entering the market, the domestic market tended to be firm but retreated within 90 yuan. After the noon close, it returned outside 90 yuan. (After the close, Reuters reported that the US Mint Committee requested the President to use the stabilization fund within March). The calculated raw price was 1,085 yuan.</p>
<p>Below is a record of the market situation for the half-day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 690.5 yuan, 1.7 yuan higher than the previous close. The opening price of goods was 0.6 yuan. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of British exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence 375 and US exchange rate at 34.1875 yuan. Zhengjin bought US dollars for April at 0.5 yuan and for May at 0.75 yuan. Hengxing, Yida, Yongfeng, Huixiang, and others all entered, and the price rose to 4.8 yuan. Zhengjin sold US dollars for May at 0.625 yuan. Fuyu, Hengtai, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, and others sold off, and the price dropped to 2.3 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yuhengxing, and others continued to buy, and the price rose to 4 yuan. It was rumored that HSBC quoted British flat and US rising 0.125. Bingxing and Dalianbang sold bonds, and the price retreated within 2 yuan. Zhengjin and Huabi bought US dollars for May at 0.6875 yuan. Dadecheng, Dafa, Yong Zhifeng, and others took advantage of the low price to buy bonds, and the market improved. However, Western merchant Ke Lai sold off, and large accounts such as Fuyu, Shunli, Yuanmao, Yong, and others followed suit, and the price retreated to 1 yuan. Domestic banks were still pushing up, and there was much fluctuation. After entering the market, Sassoon sold US dollars, and Daxingyong and Dadecheng sold to 89 yuan. Yifengyong, Dakang, Dafa, Yong, and others bought in, pushing the price up to 91.4 yuan. After entering the market, Dongya and others continued to sell US dollars for May at 0.6875 to 0.75 yuan. Zhejiang sold US dollars for May at 0.8125 yuan. Dadecheng and Yuanmao Yong sold off, and market sentiment seemed tired, and the price fell to 87.5 yuan. Zhifeng, Yonghengxing, Tianfeng, Hengyu, and others continued to buy bonds, and the situation was still flat, gradually rising back to 90.07 yuan. Hengyu, Huixiang, Hongli, Senchangyong all took advantage of the high price to supply, and then the price dropped to 88.3 yuan. Finally, due to Yuanmao Yong and Shunli buying bonds, the noon closing price was 689.3 yuan. After the close, Zhifeng Yong and others bought bonds, and the price of goods was strongly raised, rising outside 90 yuan. The price of goods was bid at 91 yuan. The highest price for the half-day was 694.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 687.5 yuan, a fluctuation of 7.3 yuan. The result was a slight increase of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 711 yuan because HSBC's US exchange rate listing rose 0.125 to 33.75 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 2 yuan less than the pledged price, 3 yuan less than the previous closing. The logged-in price for this month was 712 yuan, for February it was 703 yuan, and for March it was 689 yuan. The water supplement in the morning was 712 yuan. The calculated raw price was 1,085 yuan. Approximately 1,000 taels were sold by Tianjin help to fellow traders within the market, initially at 1,085 yuan, then at 84 yuan, and finally at 1,084.5 yuan. Zhifeng Yong paid Yicheng 63 bonds, paid Hengyu 217 bonds, both at 0.96 yuan for January dropping to March futures. Zhaofengchang paid 70 bonds at 13 yuan for February dropping to March futures. There are now 1,561 bonds remaining for January.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat overall. In total, Zhifeng Yong, Huixiang, Dafayong, Dachangxiang, Yicheng, Yiyu, Tianfeng, Yuanmao Yong, Qianchangxiang, Yongde, Hengchang, Yongda, Kang, Zhaofengchang, Hengxing, and others were on the buying side. Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxing, Hengyu, Hengtai, Sida, Yuanchun, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Senchangyong, Changshengyong, Yuanxingyong, and others were on the selling side. Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Futai, Hengfuyu, Hengxingyuan, and others initially bought and then sold. Dalianbang and Shunli jointly traded over 1,900 bonds, netting over 300 bonds. Wanxing jointly traded slightly less than 1,300 bonds, netting over 200 bonds. Guangdong help Hengxing bought over 400 bonds and sold over 100 bonds.</p>
<p>The total number of transactions today was 51,401 bonds. There are 6,489 bonds remaining for February. As of today, there are a total of 38,318 chips for March.</p>
<p>As of today, the lineup for March includes: Wanxing with over 5,800 long positions, Hongxing with over 4,300, Qianchangxiang with over 3,600, Fuyu with slightly over 3,000, Yuanheng with slightly over 2,700, Fuchang with slightly over 2,600, Yiyu with slightly over 2,500, Yifengyong with slightly over 1,500, Runchangyu with slightly over 1,300, Dadecheng with slightly under 1,200, Hongxingyong with over 700.

<p>Rules for Margin Payment and Delivery</p>
<p>Regarding the rules for margin payment and delivery on the Gold Exchange, such as delivery of spot goods and cash coin substitutes, or special changes occurring during delivery, the old rules have been consulted and re-announced. Relevant clauses are selected and recorded below:</p>
<p>Article 46: If cash coins are used as substitutes for delivery, US cash coins shall be the standard. 240 US cash coins shall equal one tael of margin gold (90% purity, each coin being a US cash coin of 5 yuan, weighing 2 qian 2 fen 7 li 5 hao). Each seller shall pay the buyer 1.4 yuan in firework silver coins. However, this shall not apply if the US current monetary system changes its purity or weight.</p>
<p>Article 47: On the final day of the buying period, if the goods are not delivered in full, the initial US exchange rate quoted by HSBC on that day shall be used as the standard to calculate and settle one tael of margin gold at 240 US dollars. If the purity or weight changes, all concluded transactions shall be based on the initial British and US exchange rates quoted by HSBC on the day before the change, as calculated based on the British exchange rate quoted by HSBC on the final day of the monthly period. 240 US dollars shall equal one tael of margin gold.</p>
<p>For example, if the British exchange rate quoted by HSBC on the day before the change is 1 shilling 2 pence 75 and the US exchange rate is 24 yuan, the calculated British and US exchange rate is 3.90508. Using the US exchange rate of 24 yuan, the price per tael of margin gold is 1,000 yuan. Also, if the HSBC British exchange rate on the last day of May is 1 shilling 3 pence, using the British and US exchange rate of 3.90508, the equivalent US exchange rate is 24 yuan 4 jiao 0 li 6 hao 7 si, calculating the price per tael of margin gold at 983 yuan 3 jiao 4 fen. If the HSBC British exchange rate on the last day of June is 1 shilling 2 pence 5 hao, using the British and US exchange rate of 3.90508, the equivalent US exchange rate is 23 yuan 5 jiao 9 fen 3 li 1 hao, calculating the price per tael of margin gold at 1,017 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. If the HSBC British exchange rate on the last day of July is 1 shilling 2 pence 875, using the British and US exchange rate of 3.90508, the equivalent US exchange rate is 24 yuan 2 jiao 0 li 3 hao 3 si, calculating the price per tael of margin gold at 991 yuan 6 jiao.</p>
<p>In addition, the US exchange rate on the last day of each month shall be calculated based on the long and short positions of the British exchange rate.</p>
<p>Article 48: If there are extraordinary changes on the delivery day of a concluded futures transaction and HSBC does not quote a price, the settlement shall be based on the rules set by the Gold Industry Association.</p>
<p>(Appendix: Rules of the Gold Industry Association)</p>
<p>If HSBC does not quote the US exchange rate, the British exchange rate quoted on the day before HSBC did not quote the US exchange rate shall be used, i.e., 1 shilling 3 pence per silver dollar for the British exchange rate and 24.375 yuan per 100 silver dollars for the US exchange rate, with the British and US exchange rate being 3.9 yuan. If HSBC still does not quote the US exchange rate on the final day, regardless of any changes or incoming news, the British and US exchange rate of 3.9 yuan on the last day HSBC quoted the US exchange rate shall be used as the standard for calculation, i.e., the equivalent US exchange rate is 23.5625 yuan if the British exchange rate shortens to 1 shilling 2 pence 5 hao, and the equivalent US exchange rate is 25.1875 yuan if the British exchange rate lengthens to 1 shilling 3 pence 5 hao, with the remaining calculations following the same pattern. The decimal places shall be rounded to the sixth digit. 240 US dollars shall equal one tael of margin gold. (The benchmark British and US exchange rate is approximately 4.86 yuan, but due to international financial relations, there are occasional fluctuations.)</p>
<p>In the event that HSBC does not quote either the British or US exchange rate, one should wait quietly until the final day. If the seller has not delivered the goods in full by the final day and HSBC still does not quote the British or US exchange rate, the US exchange rate initially quoted on the day before HSBC did not quote the rates shall be used as the standard, and one tael of margin gold shall be settled at 240 US dollars uniformly. Neither the buyer nor the seller shall have any objection. If only the British exchange rate is quoted and not the US exchange rate, the above provisions shall apply.</p>
<p>Sassoon Resells 600,000 US Dollars</p>
<p>丨Domestic Market Reverses Flat and Then Tight丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign news, London large bonds rose by 0.1875 in the near term and 0.25 in the long term. US banks rose by 0.125. Long-term silver prices slightly decreased. The British rate against the US increased by 0.0725, and the US rate against the British increased by 0.0675. The British rate against France increased by 0.6 yuan, and the US rate against the British increased by 0.03. Private telegrams indicated that silver prices should remain unchanged. Exchange rates increased by 0.065.</p>
<p>The exchange market opened in the morning with the recent selling price of the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence 375 and the US exchange rate at 34.1875 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.125 and the US rate was flat. After the opening, the market tightened due to bank closings. However, HSBC's listing revealed that the US rate rose by 0.125, the French rate rose by 7 francs, the German rate rose by 1 mark, and the Holland rate rose by 0.5 guilder. The banks took advantage of the high prices to release and loosen the market. Finally, the situation tended to be sluggish, and the process was also hard.</p>
<p>At the noon close, the recent selling price of the British exchange rate was 1 shilling 4 pence 375, and the US exchange rate was 34.125 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.125, and the US exchange rate tightened by 0.0625. Sassoon sold off some US dollars, approximately 600,000 yuan. However, they bought 50,000 pounds, and Chinese merchants bought approximately 200,000 US dollars. The banks mostly released, selling more than they bought.</p>
<p>Below is a record of the half-day transactions:</p>
<p>The British exchange rate opened in the morning with the recent selling price at 1 shilling 4 pence 375. HSBC sold 0.05625 for May and 0.0625 for June to Sassoon. Huabi and Zhengjin bought 0.05625 for April. Citibank and Huabi sold 0.04375 for February. Zhejiang sold 0.05625 for April. Mai Jiali bought 0.0625 for May. The noon closing selling price ranged from 1 shilling 4 pence 375 to 5625. The buying price added 0.0625.</p>

<p>Amateur Ramblings: More on Our Guiding Ideology. By Gong Pu</p>
<p>In the 57th issue of this publication, I casually discussed "Our Guiding Ideology." At that time, my writing lacked precision. Now that Mr. Zhi Ping has raised the discussion (see the previous issue's commentary), it seems necessary to delve further.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhi Ping offered a plethora of answers to this question. However, "Which is correct?" According to him, it is the ideology represented by those who can execute solutions to China's fundamental problems today. This sounds right, but from a historical perspective, this answer lacks the significance of the history of social evolution.</p>
<p>Frankly, China currently lacks a guiding ideology. The term "guiding ideology" refers to a controlling consciousness. In the past, Confucianism dominated Chinese consciousness. However, it was a product of an agricultural economy and feudal society. Once that foundation began to waver, this ideological system inevitably fragmented. Therefore, it is undeniable that Confucianism is declining in Chinese society today.</p>
<p>Capitalist ideology also cannot occupy a dominant position in China. The ideas of Adam Smith and Rousseau cannot become China's "guiding ideology" because, while Chinese society and economy have not yet fully reached a capitalist form, the foundation of world capitalism is already shaking. Capitalist ideology is also disintegrating day by day. The controlling consciousness has lost its basis for existence, and the world is in contradiction. However, China's contradictions are more complex than those of Britain and the United States. Therefore, we can propose many answers to China's "guiding ideology," while two or three would suffice for European and American countries.</p>
<p>We currently have no "guiding ideology." What about the future? The answer will be determined by the stage completed by the social economy. Confucianism became China's "guiding ideology" and dominated for over two thousand years for a reason. We must understand that the process of completing a "guiding ideology" succeeds step by step with the economic foundation. It is not that there is a controlling consciousness first, and then the country is built. Nation-building and ideological control are completed simultaneously. China's current chaos is complete; it is political chaos and ideological chaos. Although the new process has grown from the old womb, the old process has not completely ended, and the phenomenon that appears is extreme contradiction. As for what will become the controlling "guiding ideology" in the future, it is easy to point out: first, it must be an ideology that is compatible with the transformation of the social economy; second, it must also be an ideology that guides the completion of this social economic transformation. This situation is not unique to China. Most countries in the world are like this. (I will discuss what remains to be said later.)</p>
<p>Life Intersection: Rickshaw Puller</p>
<p>[Hey, sir! Mister! Rickshaw, you want?] Little Zhang, pulling a rickshaw, asked a foreign soldier in green uniform with his impure Jiangbei pidgin. He asked several times, but the soldier didn't respond, as if he were dead.</p>
<p>[Hey, sir! Miss! Miss! Rickshaw, you want? You want?] He tried to do business with a foreign girl in the same way. She ignored him and left, another disappointment.</p>
<p>Ah! Little Zhang's luck has been really bad these past few days. He goes out day and night but can't make a few deals. Sometimes, the patrol officer confiscates his license, and he can't even pay the rickshaw rent. He has his wife, Little Gouzi, Little Sanzi, and a whole group of people to support. It's not enough to even get porridge, let alone rice!</p>
<p>[Hey, sir! Do you need a rickshaw?] He asked a Chinese young master. He was wearing a neat serge overcoat, a high silk felt hat, and his leather shoes made a loud sound. He looked very impressive.</p>
<p>[Come here! Hurry up!] He replied with a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
<p>The rickshaw approached; the cushion was flipped over and dusted off. These were Little Zhang's old tricks for every deal. The young master jumped into the rickshaw, and Little Zhang started running. He ran for about a mile in one breath, faster than a flying leg. After a while, they arrived. The young master threw down two dimes.</p>
<p>[Hey! It's about ten miles from over there to here, taking about an hour, but I only got two dimes. Damn it, I sweated half a bucket! The dog stabs!] Little Zhang muttered as he took the money, but when he saw the young master's inviolable demeanor, he lowered his voice, pulled the rickshaw, and ran away.</p>
<p>It was half an hour before the rickshaw had to be returned. He wanted to make another deal, but he asked ten or so customers, and none of them paid attention to him. The time was getting shorter and shorter, with only fifteen minutes left.</p>
<p>[Rickshaw! Rickshaw! Come here! Come here!] A modern girl shouted in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>Little Zhang heard it and immediately pulled the rickshaw straight over.</p>
<p>[Where? Where?]</p>
<p>[Across from Zhaofeng Park.]</p>
<p>Little Zhang thought: My rickshaw company is near Zhaofeng Park, so isn't it convenient to return the rickshaw?</p>
<p>[Okay! Go! Go!]</p>
<p>[How many copper coins?]</p>
<p>[Two dimes.]</p>
<p>[Bah! You want two dimes? No way! No way!]</p>
<p>[One dime, will you go?]</p>
<p>[Add a little more, okay?]</p>
<p>[Not a penny more.]</p>
<p>[Okay! Go! Go! Go! I'm returning the rickshaw, so I'll give you a cheaper price.]</p>
<p>There were only ten minutes left before the rickshaw had to be returned. He pulled as fast as he could, his mind racing: Hurry! There will be wine to drink! Little Sanzi can at least eat a few more pancakes.</p>
<p>[We're here! We're here!]</p>
<p>[Bah! What is this place? I want to go across from Zhaofeng Park. Are you new to this business? Don't you even know Zhaofeng Park?]</p>
<p>[Don't worry! This is Caojiadu. Isn't that Zhaofeng Park across the street?]</p>
<p>[Ah! Who told you to pull me here! This is across from the back gate of Zhaofeng Park. I want to go to the front gate on Yu Garden Road. Hurry up and pull me there!]</p>
<p>[Ah! Miss! Have pity on me! I have to return the rickshaw! The time has already arrived. If I'm late, I'll have to pay a penalty! Please go through the park!]</p>
<p>[Nonsense! I don't have a permit. How can I go in?]</p>
<p>She wouldn't get off: [Hurry up and pull! Don't you have ears?]</p>
<p>The policeman came over, and she explained the reason to him.</p>
<p>Little Zhang interjected: [She told me to pull her across from Zhaofeng Park. Isn't this it?]</p>
<p>In the end, she won. She had beautiful clothes; money that could suppress people.</p>
<p>[Go! Pull her there! I'll give you an extra dime.] The policeman judged.</p>
<p>[Ah! Have pity on me! I have to return the rickshaw! I can't stay any longer!]</p>
<p>[Who told you not to ask clearly at first! Are you going or not? Do you want to be beaten with a stick?]</p>
<p>She won. He had to go, gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>That day, Little Zhang paid two rickshaw rents. After taking out a day's earnings, he was still two copper coins short. He didn't even have porridge to eat.</p>

<p>Amateur Sports: Deep Breathing. By Yu Shi Shusheng</p>
<p>Deep breathing is an easy and highly effective full-body exercise. Simply stand straight in the sunlight with clean air, close your mouth, and slowly inhale the nourishing air from the space through your nostrils. Raise your limbs to increase the suction. When you have inhaled to the end, exhale the carbon dioxide from your lungs as much as possible through your nostrils. Lower your feet as you exhale to the peak, then it is complete. Rest for a moment, then do it again. Do this twice a day, morning and evening, about twenty times each time.</p>
<p>Deep breathing is not only good for health but also the only effective way to prevent tuberculosis. It can prevent tuberculosis and improve health. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<p>First, in normal breathing, the lungs expand and contract only slightly and cannot develop fully. Moreover, the tissue at the apex of the lungs is completely different from other parts. Its blood flow and lymph flow are very slow, so it is easily infected by the blood. The distribution of blood vessels is less than in other parts, so it is often found in an anemic state. Due to poor tissue and insufficient nutrition, resistance is weak. The apex of the lungs, therefore, becomes a breeding ground for tuberculosis bacteria and a training ground for tuberculosis. To prevent this danger, we must often do deep breathing because deep breathing allows fresh air to reach the apex of the lungs directly, making the air exchange in the apex of the lungs vigorous. In this way, the lungs can develop fully, and the anemic state can be transformed into a congested state.</p>
<p>Second, in normal breathing, only the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles move. When deep breathing, the scalene muscles and seventeen other muscles also move; therefore, deep breathing is also closely related to muscle movement. During deep breathing, the diaphragm descends, pressing on the abdominal cavity. Because there is matter in the intestines that cannot be reduced, the abdominal wall expands forward. When it expands to the point where it can no longer expand, it reverses towards the stomach wall, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, etc. The surface is subjected to pressure; thus, the blood accumulated in these parts is dispersed in all directions. When the pressure is released, it flows in from all directions. This outward and inward movement can improve the blood circulation in the abdominal cavity. Therefore, the nerves distributed in the abdominal cavity,</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>also receive the same effect and become stronger. The functions of the organs in the abdominal cavity are therefore enhanced. Various diseases will have no way to arise.</p>
<p>Third, when we inhale deeply, the pressure in the chest cavity is suddenly reduced, and the blood stored in the brain parenchyma flows into the chest cavity. During deep exhalation, the pressure in the chest cavity gradually increases, and the blood in the chest cavity flows back into the brain marrow. Therefore, frequent deep breathing can make the blood cycle in the brain marrow more adjusted, and diseases of blood circulation disorders and blood vessel lesions can be prevented. Each time deep breathing not only improves blood and lymph fluids but also provides proper exercise for the organs in the chest and abdominal cavities and the muscles of the whole body. Therefore, the stomach and intestines are directly affected, and appetite gradually increases.</p>
<p>If we can practice deep breathing regularly in the morning and evening during our leisure time, then the weak can become strong, the short-lived can be transformed into long-lived, and even severe diseases such as tuberculosis can be turned into mild diseases, and mild diseases will, of course, be easier to recover.</p>
<p>However, people who already have tuberculosis should not practice deep breathing if they have the following four conditions because their lungs have severe injuries and cannot withstand such expansion and contraction: (1) a strong tendency to hemoptysis; (2) sputum containing blood; (3) severe coughing; (4) body temperature above 38 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Workers! I respectfully present this to you, hoping that you will resolve to practice it and accept my sincere call. If you can do this, then tuberculosis, pleurisy, meningitis, arthritis, nephritis, and other diseases can be reduced.</p>
<p>1933 Overall Review: The Soviet Economy in 1933. By Fang Ping</p>
<p>1933 was the first year of the Soviet Union's second five-year plan. The summary of the first five-year plan shows that the Soviet Union completed the following achievements:</p>
<p>1.  The country was largely industrialized. This created the basis for completing the transformation of the entire national economy itself.</p>
<p>2.  Small peasant economies gradually occupied an insignificant position in the rural economy, replaced by collective farms and Soviet farms, which new economic units occupied a dominant position.</p>
<p>3.  Therefore, the roots of small peasant private economy in the countryside gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>4.  At the same time, the horrors of unemployment and poverty also disappeared. The opposition between cities and villages and the "scissors price" no longer existed. National income has increased, cultural level has developed, and the death rate has been reduced. The population has therefore surged.</p>
<p>Since the second five-year plan began to be implemented, the Soviet Union's economic position has now surpassed many capitalist powers: it ranks first in the world in the manufacture of agricultural machinery, the manufacture of tractors and combined tillage machines, and the mining of peat; it ranks second in the world in the production of iron and oil, and first in Europe; it ranks third in the world in electricity; it ranks fourth in the world in coal production and the chemical industry.</p>
<p>This year (as far as the first ten months of 1933 are concerned), the parts that have been completed not only according to the planned plan but also exceeding its limits are: tractors have completed 62,070 units in October, exceeding the plan by 101%; machine manufacturing industry, production in the first nine months increased by 16% compared with the same period in 1932; steel production, production in the first nine months increased by 30.36% compared with the same period in 1932; coal increased by 13.9%; oil increased by 23.4%; electricity increased by 120.3%, exceeding the United Kingdom; chemical industry increased by 120.2%.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the leap in industry is the transformation of agriculture on the basis of industry. The technical transformation of agriculture is a feature of this period. There are now 2,300 agricultural machinery stations across the country, and 150,000 tractors are working on collective farms. There are now more than 5,000 state farms.</p>
<p>This year's harvest is a good phenomenon that has not been seen since 1884. Crops such as wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, and corn are very abundant. In Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and the Volga River Basin, the harvest volume increased by two to two and a half times compared with 1932. Winter harvest is not yet included. This is the result of technical improvements.</p>
<p>This is a rough outline of the Soviet economy in 1933.</p>
<p>International Broadcast Radio Station: The Crowd on the American Unemployment Line. By Luo Lun</p>
<p>Mr. ××: This Broadway, which used to be prosperous, has been even more indifferent for a month. A dying atmosphere is most likely to make people shake their heads. The shops on the entire Broadway seem to be deflated rubber bladders, shrinking their income day by day. But the shop assistants have free time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the small city of Portland had a big commotion, and Broadway was the center of the commotion.</p>
<p>We usually open at ten o'clock. (Our shop specializes in Chinese labor business. Even if some inferior Americans come, they are either gamblers or drunkards, and these people don't go to restaurants in the morning.) I knew that around nine o'clock, the street was noisy and unreasonable, like at night. I was young and liked to watch the excitement. I knew that a large line of unemployed workers was lying in front of me.</p>
<p>This line of unemployed workers made me realize that most Americans have not sewn a new piece of clothing in five years and have not entered a piece of bread in ten days. What I usually see are some middle-class poor Americans who are often in danger of being beaten because of our racial relations. I have never gone into the poorest people's houses in the United States to investigate.</p>
<p>, casting glances at other people's heels with a parallel line downward gaze, as if afraid that we foreigners would visit, but these are limited to women; men are naked, holding long and wide slogans, shouting short slogans.</p>
<p>Most of the slogans and slogans are like this: [Please the government to maintain the interests of workers!] [Please the government to provide relief to unemployed workers!] [Investigate factories that have stopped work!] […………………]</p>
<p>On the surface, these are not intense sentences, but they have already alarmed the capitalists of Portland.</p>
<p>There are many people watching on the side of the street. A small city usually has unemployed workers wandering in the street. Once they gather together, the sidewalks on both sides are as silent as death, leaving only a huge stream rolling back and forth in the middle of the street.</p>
<p>Ten o'clock has passed, and the huge stream of people is still rolling in, and the sidewalks on both sides are still silent!</p>
<p>It seems that this is the arrival of a storm. Many restaurants, theaters, and other shops of all kinds have not left their doors idle. This Broadway is considered a relatively prosperous street. Theaters will grab the money of unemployed workers, wine will corrupt the spirit of workers, and women will thin the bodies of workers. Everything is the tomb of workers. But now this tomb is starting in a strange way. How terrible should this be for Portland!</p>
<p>People are smart. The demonstrations and parades of unemployed workers in other cities are the beginning of commotions and the prelude to looting. Therefore, shop owners will definitely be smart to close the door and refuse the intrusion of thugs, and our "Chinese Youth" shops will also smartly close the door.</p>
<p>This line has passed.</p>
<p>I hid in the shop, thinking that things were over around ten o'clock, when a huge thunder-like torrent rolled in, and I was looking at it on the second floor.</p>
<p>The line of unemployed workers came back from the east of the street again, but this time it was an unorganized commotion.</p>
<p>Many people shouted, many people walked, many people broke into other people's shops... Here, there were majestic songs, urgent shouts, chaos, and disorder, rushing into theaters, restaurants... like countless giant beasts.</p>
<p>I was frightened and shuddering there.</p>
<p>After about a few minutes, a large team of police came by car. A row of guns [bang! bang! bang!...] demonstrated to the sky!</p>
<p>The police piled into the line of unemployed workers, with guns resting on their chests. So, these hungry ghosts either grabbed something and walked away, or ran away empty-handed, or were caught by the police and were still singing loudly there. The streets were filled with a very panicked state!</p>
<p>After a long, long time, the streets became a dead cemetery. Only the police were patrolling.</p>
<p>It almost gradually returned to its original state in the evening. Our shop has not been looted, probably because their focus is on the big stores.</p>
<p>Today's newspapers wrote this:</p>
<p>[More than forty thugs were arrested; stores disturbed accounted for six-tenths of Broadway...](Luo Lun at the Portland [Chinese Youth] Hall)</p>
<p>"Small Society Model": Secret Winter Warmer Car. By Donghai Big Furnace Room</p>
<p>[Roar! Roar! Roar!] The fire is jumping, jumping.</p>
<p>The small round door opened, illuminating Fatty's fat face red. The dark coal pile also turned into a small hill covered in blood. Iron shovel, iron lever... all the tools came to life in the warm fire!</p>
<p>They came to life, Xiao Sizi, Wang Darong, Yinsi Ghost A'er, Lin Bao... who sneaked out of the boxing department. Those frozen arms, those frozen hands, began to stir, slowly dragging them out of their pockets, reaching towards the big stove, running forward a few steps... warm, warm... They like fire, they love the hot fire.</p>
<p>[Hey! Lin Bao, stand guard outside. It's no joke if the director comes.] Wang Darong shook his shoulders and said.</p>
<p>[Pfft, you want me to go to the door to eat the wind. Isn't the director also a person? Don't we feel cold? Are we supposed to be blown to death by the northwest wind?] Lin Bao said unhappily.</p>
<p>Xiao Sizi threw his left foot on the coal: [Damn it, so many rooms would rather be empty, let dogs pee and park cars. Damn it, cars need rooms, but people don't need rooms, and the boxing department is put in the open air.]</p>
<p>That's right, the boxing department is in the open air, with only a layer of tinplate on top. The wind blows in like the wind, the rain hits in like the rain, and the snow floats in like the snow. Who inside doesn't complain? The only one who doesn't complain is the director, he has a glass room to live in and receives commissions. The electric furnace puts on a smiling face towards him, and he wears a fur coat of a wild animal on his body.... After all, the higher the position, the better the life. Isn't the manager more comfortable than the director? Milk, fish, eggs are supplements he eats.</p>
<p>The stove burner Fatty kept throwing shovel after shovel of coal into the mouth of the big stove. It stretched out its fiery tongue and swallowed it mouthful by mouthful. This guy's appetite is really big, as if he can't get enough to eat in his whole life. The pipe is emitting heat, and Fatty's forehead is also emitting heat. Everyone envied Fatty, saying that he got a good job. In this cold weather, he relies on the fire all day long, and it doesn't matter if his clothes are thinner.</p>
<p>[Fat brother, you're really happy.]</p>
<p>Burning until late at night</p>
<p>[Isn't the baking room finished at six o'clock?]</p>
<p>[Burning water heaters, the water heaters in the gentlemen's rooms. Do you think I, Old Fatty, got this good job? Hehehehehe! Doing barbecue all year round. Who's lips and skin are as dry as mine from being smoked by the flames? I have to be able to lift dozens of pounds of coal with one shovel. It's so hot in June that I can't breathe. The water vapor from the glass management drips on my body and blisters. The cold weather, the cold weather is also not good! Turning off the stove at night and rushing into the northwest wind is like suddenly immersing a piece of red-hot iron in cold water. But, people are not iron,</p>
<p>who doesn't want</p>
<p>to live? Fortunately, I'm a big fatty , some minor problems can still be endured. [Speaking, he slammed the iron shovel in his hand into the coal pile, shaking</p>

<p>Foreign Postal Agent: Dry Straw Squeezing Oil. By Wang Xing Sichuan Yanzhou Correspondence</p>
<p>Sichuan is one of the richest provinces in China and has always had the reputation of [Heavenly Kingdom]. Friends from other provinces who have not been to this [Heavenly Kingdom] want to go to the Kui Gate to take a look! To see what kind of paradise this is. However, now if someone really arrives in Sichuan, then he will definitely be completely disappointed. Because now Sichuan, no matter where you go, what you see are scenes of poverty, hunger, and terror. The so-called [Land of Abundance] has now become a dark hell. In the rural areas here, not only poor and middle peasants have no food to eat, but even rich peasants and landlords have no way to maintain their facade. The situation in the cities is also the same. Shop assistants, workers, and ordinary people naturally cannot maintain their minimum standard of living, and even small and medium-sized merchants are increasingly on the road to bankruptcy. Where is the money? It can be said that it is completely concentrated in the hands of a few warlords and bureaucrats. According to the investigation, Sichuan warlords have more than 90 million deposits in the Shanghai Zhenjin Bank alone. I don't know about other banks; among the Sichuan warlords, all those above the rank of brigade commander have at least 5 million in property. Where did these come from? Of course, it is due to the exploitation of the people of Sichuan, the so-called scraping the ground.</p>
<p>The situation of Sichuan warlords and bureaucrats exploiting the people, the so-called scraping the ground, has long been published in various newspapers, and everyone knows it 丨丨. For example, the people of Sichuan have paid grain taxes up to the 80s of the Republic of China (in this situation of internal and external troubles, the nervous me, really have some doubts whether the Republic of China has the life of the 80s!). They have to constantly bear patriotic donations, opium donations, anti-Japanese donations, head donations...... 丨丨丨, there is no need to say more. What I want to say now is the recent situation in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Recently, because the situation is unstable and troops are constantly being transferred, the necessary departure expenses and supplies have naturally increased, and at the same time, the opportunities for warlords and bureaucrats to exploit the people have greatly increased. In the past, they had to ask the people for money in the name of what donations and what taxes. Now, they don't even want these superficial names, but just say very simply to the people: The need for military funds is very urgent, you give it to me! If the people have no money to give, then they can say that this is disobeying orders, drag these people to hang them up like ducks floating on water, until they force out the last bit of blood and sweat from these people. This method of forcing money from the poor is called dry straw squeezing oil by the Sichuan warlords and bureaucrats. Whenever they use this method to force a little money out of the people, they will proudly say: I can squeeze oil out of dry straw!</p>
<p>As a result, the peasants have no choice but to flee first, leaving the countryside to find another way out. As for the landlords, at first, they still reluctantly lived in the countryside, dealing with the exploitation of the warlords and bureaucrats. Later, because the cash was used up, the land could not be sold for a penny, and the warlords and bureaucrats did not allow the land to be used to offset donations and taxes. So, they had no choice but to run away. Recently, a very common strange phenomenon has occurred in the rural areas of Sichuan 丨丨. The landlords sneaked away and posted the land contract all over the house they left behind. This means: It shows that they are unable to bear the extortion of the warlords and bureaucrats, please take their land away!</p>
<p>Recently, such a thing happened in a certain county in western Sichuan 丨丨. A rich peasant who had once studied was arrested by the debt collectors and taken to the county to see the county magistrate because he had no money to pay the military funds. When he saw the county magistrate, before the county magistrate asked him, he opened his mouth and said: I am from the eighteenth level of hell! The county magistrate was inexplicable and just scolded angrily: What! But he said calmly: I am from the eighteenth level of hell. You scrape the ground, scraping one level and two levels, and now you have scraped to the eighteenth level, scraping to me... The county magistrate did not wait for him to finish speaking, and roared angrily: Madman! Madman! Take him down! So, the rich peasant was taken into prison.</p>
<p>The words spoken by this seemingly crazy rich peasant, although a bit crazy! But this is the best depiction of the current situation in rural Sichuan.</p>
<p>Book Review: New Meaning of Motherly Love. By Hu Zijia</p>
<p>丨"Mother" by Gorky, translated by Shen Duanxian, published by Dajiang Bookstore, the upper part is priced at one yuan, and the lower part is one yuan and two corners丨</p>
<p>[Mother's love] is great, surpassing everything, and many people even exaggerate it in praise. Look, how many poets, writers, and philosophers in ancient and modern times have praised [great motherly love]! It seems that with the caress of motherly love, all pain and suffering will disappear; and those who have lost motherly love are the most pitiful people in the world. Isn't it? Until now, the world has always recognized [motherly love] as the most thorough, the purest, the most...</p>
<p>Let's say [opposite]: Recently, we have often heard [the painful groans of motherly love's shackles] by our ears. And those who make these groans are a group of lively sons who are bravely pioneering new roads through thorns and thistles.</p>
<p>[If I didn't have a mother, I could move forward more unencumbered... but my mother is so pitiful!]</p>
<p>[I'm most afraid of seeing my mother. Every time I see her, she will cry to me. She cries, she cries so that I feel uncomfortable!]</p>
<p>[No matter what I say, my mother always foresees danger, and this premonition constitutes the force of prevention. I escaped from the shackles of motherly love... but when I see the old face with tears streaming down, I can't help but feel pain.]</p>
<p>[............]</p>
<p>Every time I hear this kind of voice, the outline of Gorky's [Mother] emerges in my mind: understand the son, understand the son's era, understand the son's career, understand the mission that the son bears, and at the same time understand oneself, understand one's own task, and move forward in step with the son...</p>
<p>The mother has already stopped crying, and the mother has already taken big steps directly towards the current [danger] and ran together with her son. This is what truly completes the great motherly love: not only loving one's own son, but also loving all the sons who have the same destiny as one's own son.</p>
<p>Our real life will tell our mothers: loving only for oneself is narrow-minded, and it will become rootless; being confined to the past and ignorant of the present will be forgotten by the future, and the son will go farther and farther. Our mothers will get closer and closer to Gorky's [Mother] day by day.</p>
<p>Motherly love is great, but its greatness lies not only in loving one's own children but also in loving all other children who have the same destiny as one's own children; in completing the mission of the era together with one's own children and all other children who have the same destiny as one's own children.</p>
<p>I believe that we can no longer hear [the painful groans of motherly love's shackles] in the near future. Isn't it? Our mothers?</p>
<p>Biographical Sketches: Hoover's Childhood (Part 1). By Wu Huifen</p>
<p>Former US President Hoover had unwavering determination in his youth, loved to learn tirelessly, and did things meticulously. He possessed the spirit of being unyielding and unafraid of difficulties. Hoover's family was very poor. His father was a blacksmith who worked hard and diligently all day long, but his economy was still very tight and he could not get enough to eat. His father had two sons and a daughter, and Hoover was his second son. Unfortunately, in the year when Hoover was four years old, his father passed away. The three siblings all depended on their mother sewing clothes for others, and relied on the wages she earned to live. In this way, they barely spent three years, and his mother died of illness due to overwork, leaving them behind. From then on, only they, young orphans, were left. Under hunger and cold, they had to separate and each go their own way to find a way to survive.</p>
<p>Hoover's eldest brother was taken away by his uncle, and his sister was fostered in his grandmother's house. Hoover himself was initially fostered by his uncle, but later he was sent to his uncle. At that time, his uncle was engaged in reclamation and school construction in Iowa, and he went there, finally starting to go to school. In addition to listening to the teacher's lectures, he also worked as a school janitor. After returning to his uncle's place from school, he also had to do some work in his uncle's farm. At that time, Hoover regarded this as his due work and did not feel any pain. After dinner every day, when everyone else was asleep, he could get some free time to study on his own. Therefore, in the quiet of the night, he could often be heard sighing, and at that time he was studying Latin and Greek.</p>
<p>After graduating from elementary school, he could not go to middle school because he did not have the financial means. It was not until Hoover was fourteen years old that his uncle established an Iowa Land Company and called him to be a servant. He started every morning by sweeping the courtyard, organizing books, and making advertisements for the company. He was diligent and hardworking all day long, not lazy or sloppy at all. Therefore, although he was a servant in name, he actually became the central figure in the company. He knew everything about the company's affairs, large and small, in detail, and sometimes the manager did not know as thoroughly as he did.</p>
<p>I don't know when, Hoover made up his mind to become a mining technician. Therefore, in his spare time every day, he desperately studied mathematics and geometry, and instruments such as protractors and compasses were never far from his hand. At that time, he was preparing to apply to the university. (To be continued)</p>

Moreover, the Expel Zheng Association sent representatives to the student unions of various universities and middle schools to request strong support. It is understood that the university student union will convene a meeting within days to organize a support association to strengthen the momentum and achieve the goal of expelling Zheng. Additionally, the Shanghai alumni association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, resolving (1) to telegraph the board of directors, requesting that they not perfunctorily appease one person while neglecting the studies and future of over a thousand students; (2) to petition the Central Political Council, the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to replace Zheng and revitalize overseas Chinese education; (3) regarding the handover of documents and funds from the previous executive and supervisory committees, it was decided to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>More Than Sixty Municipal Public Supplementary Schools</p>
<h3>Held Joint Graduation Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Director Pan Presided and Delivered the Opening Address</p>
<p>▲ Section Chief Jiang Reported on the School's Overview</p>
<p>The tenth session of the Municipal Public People's Schools and the seventh session of the Supplementary Schools of this city held a joint graduation ceremony at the Municipal People's Education Center at 2:00 PM yesterday. Director Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Section Chief Jiang Jianbai of the Fourth Section, Zhu Jiahua representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang Yuanruo representing the Municipal Government, and over 500 teachers and students from the People's and Supplementary Schools attended. Director Pan presided over the meeting and delivered the opening address, and Section Chief Jiang reported on the school's overview. Representatives from the Party and government delivered successive speeches. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Chairman Delivers Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>Chairman Director Pan delivered his opening remarks, briefly stating that the number of graduates in this session has made considerable progress compared to previous years. In terms of the number of schools and grades, it has also increased compared to the past. The funding allocated by the municipal government to the People's and Supplementary Schools has also increased. However, according to the Education Bureau's investigation, it is still not entirely satisfactory. (1) Students of the People's and Supplementary Schools have almost complete attendance at the beginning of the semester, but then gradually decrease month by month, indicating that their desire for learning is not firm. Therefore, I hope that the students present today will continue to work hard on the one hand, and on the other hand, persuade others to be persistent. (2) According to the age of students in the People's and Supplementary Schools, they should be above school age. Currently, most students in the People's and Supplementary Schools are of school age, while only a small portion are older adults who have missed out on education. The reason is that the government is limited by funding and cannot widely establish compulsory primary schools. (3) People's Schools focus on literacy and civic education, while Supplementary Schools focus on civic and vocational training. Although literacy is important, civic training is even more essential. What is the use of knowing how to read if one is ignorant of the principles of being a person? Therefore, Supplementary Schools pay special attention to civic training, hoping that everyone will understand the way to be a person, and so on.</p>
<h3>Graduation Student Statistics</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianbai, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Education Bureau, reported that this session has a total of 46 People's Schools with 51 grades, 20 Supplementary Schools with 26 grades, and a total budget of 8,952 yuan. The People's Schools have a total of 2,388 male and female students, and the Supplementary Schools have a total of 1,211 male and female students. This session of People's and Supplementary Schools has a total of over 1,300 graduates. Compared to the previous session, the number of schools has increased by 8 schools and 11 grades, the number of students has increased by 565, the funding has increased by over 3,461 yuan, and the number of graduates has increased by about 370. He then reported,</p>
<h3>General Situation of Teaching in This Session</h3>
<p>Briefly stating that People's Schools focus on literacy training, while Supplementary Schools focus on civic and vocational training. The duration of study for People's Schools in this session is five months, while Supplementary Schools remain at one year. The attendance rate of students still decreases month by month, especially in schools in rural areas. The teaching effectiveness is tested by each school on its own every month and submitted to the bureau for verification. The People's Schools also conducted two standard tests at various schools by the bureau. The performance of each school varies greatly. Looking at the overall situation of this session, the following aspects still need attention in teaching: (1) More adult dropouts should be recruited during enrollment. (2) The reasons for absenteeism should be studied, and efforts should be made to reduce them. (3) Teaching methods still need to be deeply researched to suit the psychology of the people, and so on.</p>

<p>Upset in International Football Replay</p>
<p>China Loses to Jewish Team Zero to One</p>
<p>▲ Lost a Goal in the First Quarter of an Hour</p>
<p>▲ Ineffective Counterattack, Utter Helplessness</p>
<h3>Who Says It's Not Negligence Due to Underestimation of the Enemy?</h3>
<p>How strange! The Chinese team, with its outstanding talent and neat line-up, had planned to show off its prowess in the annual International Cup and dominate Shanghai. When they first fought Portugal, they achieved their wish as expected, taking them down with one blow. Yesterday, they met the Jewish team, thinking that victory was easy. Who would have thought that a heart full of passion and future hope would be ruined by the Jewish team with a score of zero to one. There are so many upsets in this year's games. Who says it's not arrogance and negligence due to underestimation of the enemy? Now that the Jewish team has defeated the Chinese team, they will compete for the championship against the winner of today's England vs. Scotland match in a few days.</p>
