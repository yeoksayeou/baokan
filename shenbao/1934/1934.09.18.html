<p>九一八三週年紀念</p>
<h3 id="c1">「九一八」三週年痛言廷 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>瀋陽陷落，去今不過三易寒暑，而（九一八）沉痛之印象，在一般關内國人之心目中，殆己黯淡若歷史之陳跡！設今日而非爲九月十八，試問在四百兆玄黄子孫中，猶能憶及三年前之奇恥大辱者，尚有幾人！若多數國人平日之視「九一八），初無殊於歷史之陳跡，則雖參加一年一度之紀念儀式，亦不過聊以解嘲與點綴而己。如謂在一紀念塲中，貼數紙標語，呌幾聲口號，而便能完成洗恥雪恨之大業，則貼標語，呌口號，吾人過去固優爲之，大好東北，自始卽不至有陸沉之嘆，又何須多此紀念之一舉？</p>
<p>在今日各地舉行之紀念會中，吾知慷慨陳詞者有之，痛哭流涕者有之。當斯時也，人人之至性流露，恨不與敵决生死，雖懦者亦勇，怯者亦奮！然而時過境遷，則冶游者依若，狂歡者依若，淡然無動於中者亦依若。幸而今日去亡省之慘變未久，受敵之創痕猶新，尚有所謂紀念之儀式，以發洩一時之悲憤，表示幾微之敵愾。寖假則創痕日以淡，悲憤日以平，敵愾日以减，雖求一形式之紀念，亦將匪易。觀往察來，此情此境，定必不免，可不恫哉！</p>
<p>今敢建議於國人曰··吾人而果能了解紀念（九一八）之眞意義者，將必注意（九一八」之延續性，視今後之每時每刻，皆無殊於一具體而微之（九一八）而思所以先恥雪恨之道。夫而後乃得堅認我所應追求之目標，困心衡慮，殫智竭力，以準備與我公敵日本作殊死戰！此志而决，暫可不問我之實力終可勝敵幾許？且先自省··我之準備工作己成者幾許？未完者幾許？</p>
<p>我野朝人士當知兵法有言··（置之死地而後生）。誠欲在一非常之時，成就非常之業，亦惟最困難之出路，斯爲最簡直之出路。不然，如僅知迂廻曲折，抄抵抗最少之途徑以行，其一時之阻碍或甚小，而所發生之危險每甚大。吾人必欲避難趨易，以自卽於滅亡，則亦己耳，而不然者，則積極抗敵，要爲今後立國之第一義！而其推進貫澈之道，又必有待乎發揮民族精神與夫全民組織之力量！不觀乎我屢仆屢起之東北義勇軍，雖在强敵壓迫之下，猶知浴血作戰，奮鬥不懈。日前我國出席國聯代表郭泰祺氏，嘗列舉最近養勇軍之戰績，昭告世界，聞者咸爲動容，知我關外同胞之熱血猶存，人心未死，乃一致表示其欽敬之忱。我人對若許置身前驅爲國犧牲之健兒，詎忍視若無覩，而不思一援之手？又不觀乎我如火如荼之經濟絶交運動，固嘗數予敵人以重創，識者乃以爲其效力或尤勝於槍砲，在此國難日亟之秋，又詎可不繼續提倡，以盡國民之天職？凡此種種，固非一手一足之烈，一朝一夕之功，所克有濟，而所謂民族精神與夫全民組織之眞價值，於是乎顯矣！</p>
<p>嗚呼！秋風蕭瑟，落葉飄零，國難當頭，欲哭無涙！今日所可爲國人告者，惟曰··委曲求全，終成死症··積極抵抗，乃爲生路！深望國人念茲在茲，不可一誤再誤！</p>
<h3 id="c2">嗚呼今日之東北！世 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>日人自攫我東北後，卽着手製造所謂（滿洲國）之傀儡，同時復實行日（滿）統制經濟，吮吸我東北同胞之膏血，驅策我東北同胞爲牛馬，而己則自居於太上皇帝之的位，養尊處優，坐收其利。我四省同胞匍匐於日（滿）苛政之下，求生不得，覓死不能，如水益深，如火益熱，幸面愛國之心與日俱積，下裝抵抗運動，再接再厲，迄未稍衰。惟日人横加摧殘，不遺餘力，我困苦艱難之義勇軍，乃有糧盡援絶之危，至可慨也！當茲（九一八）之三週年紀念，吾人廻想前塵，悲憤塡膺，誠有欲哭無滬不堪回首之感。無己乃就東北現狀，摘要陳述，以爲國人告。夫國家興亡，匹夫有責，吾人懲前毖後，應知自勉！楚雖三户，亡秦必楚，願我四百兆玄黄子孫，共體斯旨，與敵周旋，敢信我光明燦爛之靑天白日旗，終有重復翻飛於黑山白水間之一日。</p>
<p>一，政治　僞國政府之重要職務全爲日人所覇佔，一般漢奸，盡爲食祿傀儡。日人大權在握，予取予求，靡不如意。在僞府之行政機關中，財政與交通兩部，日人之盤踞尤多，良以二部爲操縱僞國經濟之總樞，自非等閒可比，由是可見其處心積慮之一斑。此外各省省長雖爲漢奸，實則尸位素餐，一惟日人之鼻息是仰；而在各地方縣公署等，有所謂參事與屬官者，亦均由日人充任，其權力轉遠駕於縣長之上。</p>
<p>溥儀由僞執政而覥僭位，宜可躊躇滿志，無奈自僭位後，雖蓋章監印之權而亦無之，事無大小，悉操日本關東軍司令菱刈之手，溥儀飲泣吞聲，雖悔亦晚矣。</p>
<p>二，經濟　東北幣制，本極紊亂，惟經濟基礎，尚稱穏定，人民並不恐慌。事變以後，日人擬定僞國統一幣制辦法，並定本年六月底將東北前在之各種紙幣，槪行取消。顧因一般人民對於僞滿貨幣多不信任，且因僞幣初次發行過多，兼有停兌趨勢，恐蹈旣往俄國羗帖之覆轍，多不願隨便貯藏。僞府鑒於事實阻碍，不易打破，乃决將取消舊幣之令展期一年實行。再若捐稅一項，方僞組織産生伊始，固曾揚言廢除苛雜，减輕人民負担，實則横徴暴歛，無所不至。加以土匪滋擾，大水爲災，農村經濟，完全破産，去年收穫尚豐，農民以爲可以勉圖温飽，不料日人操縱全境經濟，實行封鎖，糧食禁止出口，對輸往日本之大荳，又課以重稅，爲計之毒，無以復加！不寗惟是，東北對外貿易之國别消長，較前亦有顯著之變動。就僞政府所發表之統計以觀，無論輸出輸入，中國本部之所佔比數，皆急劇下降，而日本所占之比數，則有極顯著之增加。换言之卽日本貨品己逐漸將我國本部所産之貨品，逐出於東北市塲之外，以實現其統制經濟之計劃。</p>
<p>三，烟禍　東北人民向以土地與糧食爲經濟活動之根本，現在糧價奇跌，尚多有行無市，於是人民交易，每有以烟土代貨幣者，東北之吸食鴉片者，乃較前增加十分之七。且僞國爲增進收入起見，公然指定栽種鴉片之區域，以爲徽收烟稅之地，惟吉林方面之密林山岳地帶，認爲難以維持治安者，則禁止種植。僞法規定··販買鴉片一兩以上者，處半年或二三年徒刑不等，販買十兩百兩者，反可無罪。此外如紅丸金丹海洛因白麵等之麻醉品，充斥於東北境内者，更不知多少！此種擴大施毒之政策，無非俗戕賊我東北人民之志氣，斷送我東北人民之體格而己。</p>
<p>差堪自慰者，東北之義勇軍，此起彼仆，奮鬥不懈，如最近數月來鄧鐵梅部之轉戰遼西，迭予日僞以竽創，劉亮山部活動於遼熱邊境，趙玉山等進攻賓縣，黄錫山老北風崛起本溪，齊占久部扼守長山峪，皆己膾炙人口，爲我國人所比道。東北現値靑紗帳起，義軍乘時活動，聲勢更勝於前。而因日僞没收民槍强佔民地而激起之民變，尤予義軍運動以有力之援助。日僞恐勢成燎原，無可遏止，未嘗不認爲心膓大患，而屢患加以翦除。僞軍政部近又劃定剿（匪）軍之地域，以期澈底消滅。我義軍雖不以是爲懼，而因接濟困難，亦頗有勢孤力薄之感，是則實力補助，責在吾人，願我關内同胞亟起圖之！</p>
<h3 id="c3">世界大勢與遠東問題子恒 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（一）序言</p>
<p>自上次大戰告終以還，世界各國怵於兵凶戰危之戒，皆有幡然攺圖，力謀國際和平之志，故凡有補和平之謀劃，無不儘力以求其實現，以是初則有國際聯盟之組織，繼則有華府諸約之訂立，其後又有非戰公約之簽訂，最後又有倫敦海約之成立，十數年間，和平空氣，廻互盪漾，不絶如縷者，至是復現曙光，此種現象，求諸史乘，實未前見，苟能循是而往，始終不懈，則雖不能謂國際戰爭卽可從此根除，而世界和平之不至遽遭破壞，自在世人意料之中，不謂和平之破壞，卽在倫敦海　會議告終之翌年，破壞之者，又適爲曾經簽字於此等國際條約之日本，寗非怪事。</p>
<p>然日本所以敢於悍然不顧一切而以暴力佔我北四省，亦自有故，其最顯然者，約有五端，（一）爲國聯自身力量之不足，國聯對於破壞盟約之國家，本有第十六欵之制裁，然國聯於中日東北之爭，則僅有否認僞組織之空洞决議，始終不敢以十六欵之制裁加諸日本，以是深爲世人所詬病，實則國聯卽以十六欵之制裁，加諸日本，其效力亦僅等於零，蓋國聯制裁之實施，必待有强力之會員國爲之執行，曠顧今世之足以執行此種制裁之國家，唯有英美俄三國，而此三國之制裁，又必同時恊力進行，始有效力之可言，唯當日本以飛機大砲侵我東三年來東同胞之慘狀</p>
<p>三省及寇我熱河之時，美俄固皆非國聯之會員國也，（蘇俄加入國聯，爲近頃之事實，）以此而論，國聯當日之所以僅能做到否認僞組織而未敢冒昧以制裁相許者，正其度德量力之行爲，未可厚非，蓋非然者，則其威信之掃地，必將愈甚於今日也，（二）爲華府會議之後，英美二國，若恃一國之力，皆不足以制日本，蓋英美之主力艦，雖各以五·五·三之比例，優於日本，然以美國中止菲島築港之故，其勢己不足威脅日本，同時英以防區過大，新加坡之北，無良好軍港，亦不足爲日本患，蓋美之夏威夷海軍根據地，去日本有四千海哩，英之新加坡去日本有二千九百海哩，其距離皆在有效戰程之外，除非英美恊力，日本實可制勝有餘也，（三）爲蘇俄與資本國家之對壘狀態，於九一八前後，尚未消除，如法在歐洲，方以組織反俄聯合戰綫自任，英之對俄，亦多方猜忌，美國對俄，猶未承認，於此情勢之下，日本逕佔東北，假防俄東進之名，取坐收四省之實，自足使資本國家陷於手足失措無可如何之境，（四）爲歐洲以法德爲核心之糾紛，日增嚴重，英國受其牽掣，益使無暇過問遠東之事，（五）爲英美不能協調，無法對日制裁，有此五端，遂使日本目空一切，爲所欲爲矣，故回顧過去，日本所以敢於悍然撕破國際和平條約冒舉世之大不韙者，其咎不當單由國際聯盟負責，亦不當由任何一國負責，而應由當時整個之國際局面負責也，唯自一年以來，世界大勢，己呈轉變之象，其可得而言者，則有如下之數端。</p>
<p>（二）蘇俄加入國聯與遠東</p>
<p>方日本以暴力佔我東北之時，自謂若以防俄反赤相標榜，卽能獲得國際之同情，殊不知蘇俄國際關係增進之速，未有如日本佔我東北後之顯著者也，如波羅的海各國對俄不侵條約之延長，小協約各國對俄之承認，去年法俄交親之開始，今春美國對俄之承認，最近法俄之携手，以至今日之加入國聯，幾於無一不在日本佔我東北之後，雖其原因，除日本而外，猶有一足以掀起歐洲戰禍之德國在，然其主要動力，實在日本，蓋日本對俄若無仇忌之心，則德國寗敢以向東發展自矢，故今日歐美資本國家所以承認蘇俄之地位，至欲以東歐公約包圍德國者，其意顯在消弭日德兩國東西夾擊蘇俄之危機，防止日本侵地之再度擴大，同時爲國際和平留一保障之力量，亦即所以增一他日制裁日本之勢力，故今日蘇俄之與資本國家，國體雖異，氣息己通，前此之對壘狀態，可謂己不存在，此穏奇突現象之産生，由於德國之態度者佔小半，由於日本九一八來之所爲者實佔大半，故此一國際情勢之轉變，於遠東前途之影響，實不在小。</p>
<p>（三）海縮會議與遠東</p>
<p>正式之海縮會議，卽將於明年舉行，惟預備會議，最近己在倫敦開過，日本方面之要求，最主要者卽爲不討論遠東政治問題（卽僞國今後問題，亦卽中國領土主權土地完整問題，）第二爲海軍平等問題，或採總噸數辦法，唯就歐美電訊而觀，日本此數種要求，皆無着落，英國保守黨且深悔華約之簽訂，而於麥唐納所一手造成倫敦海縮條約，尤致不滿，同時决定擴充海空軍之計劃，且於日人片面宣傳之英國己允不提政治問題一點，亦由其政府予以明白之否認，至於美國則肆力於阿拉斯加及阿留申羣島上之空軍設備，同時其前任海軍大將潑拉脫，又著文力主政治問題討論之必要，其大意以爲上次華府海縮條約之成立，原以九國公約四國公約等條約爲條件，若撕破九國公約與四國公約，則五强海縮條約卽無意義，蓋一九二二年哈定總統之所以召開華會者，正欲澄清太平洋上之戰雲，不謂太平洋上今日之風雲，較前險惡無數倍，是正吾人設法糾正前失之時，烏可置政治問題而不談云云，觀此二點，英美對於政治問題之必須討論，態度可謂一致，唯英美之間，海軍比例與艦型大小等等，尚相參商，而英國之欲恢復第一海軍國地位之意志，似亦甚具决心，故欲英美之間，全然恊調，尚不可能，唯國際情勢，變遷不居，他日之事，正未可逆料也。</p>
<p>（四）爲法意結合問題與遠東</p>
<p>數日前，歐電傳來，謂法意兩國，亦有結合之可能，此一消息，出自羅馬，而巴黎則並未提及，不獨並未提及，法通訉社且有否認之電報，眞相如何，尚在不可知之數，想法意兩國當局，以共同對德之故，或有此意，唯恐英國反對，故特放出此一消息，藉探英國意嚮所在，亦未可知，設英國而能同意，則德將成甕中之鼈，更無引起戰端之可能，其間接及於遠東之影響，自不待言，唯關鍵重心，在於英國，方今法人以竭力取得英國合作爲得計，當不至置英之意思於不顧，且爲法國計，得一意而失一英，亦有害而無利，若爲遠東計，得一意而失一英，則尤非國際大局之福，故法意之結合，若得英之同意，則足以增加遠東之和平，若不然者，則轉足增加遠東之糾紛，法國爲今日國聯之重心，且新與俄聯，當必慮及蘇俄在遠東之地位，若不出於萬全，自不致於聯意，再則法國對德布置，似己綽有餘力，對意關係，交歡己足，於此而外，實無須多事也。</p>
<p>（五）悲觀與樂觀</p>
<p>就上述數點而觀，遠東問題之前途，雖尚有其悲觀之點，然可樂觀之處，亦不在少，其最顯然者，卽今日力圖擴展領土之國家，在歐洲唯有德國，在遠東唯有日本，除此而外，世界各國，似皆中止其領土之野心，如今日之英，屬地己遍全球，其版圖之大，己在其國防力之上，故其身份不啻一豪富之家，身家爲重，苟非萬不得己，必不願以黷武之政策，更謀領土之擴張，蓋戰爭再起，英帝國難保不有土崩之患，故其政策，以確保國際和平爲上計，蓋唯如是，始足以自保也，至於美國，己有放棄菲島之明確表示，自不至於再有擴展海外領土之野心，法國屬地亦多，其在歐洲，以保持和約利益爲最大要求，故其地位，亦等於守成之家，若至蘇俄，旣己放棄世界革命政策，又與各國簽訂不侵條約，今復加入國聯，則其不欲以非法之手段，侵略他人領土之志，亦約略可見，故今日難保其必無擴展土地之野心者，唯有遠東之日，與歐西之德，但反對此種企圖之國家，旣有英美法俄等國，則數量上和平之勢力，己勝於侵略之勢力，此可爲藥觀者一也，再從此數國家能否合作之可能性上觀察，美之與日，不獨不能妥協，將來且有兵戎相見之可能，而英美之關係，今雖未能協調，然其不致兵戎相見，則殊爲明顯，故以日美之關係，與英美之關係，兩兩相較，卽知英美之關係，實親於美日，亦卽英美之關係，深於英日之關係，華府會議時英國所以徇美之請，廢除英日同盟者，其故在此，以今日之日美關係與當日之日美關係較，其惡劣程度，實不可同日而語，英旣毅然廢除英日同盟於日美關係未極緊張之昔日，自應貫澈初衷於日美關係己極緊張之今日，故英日同盟復活之謠，實不值一闢也，有人以爲英日同盟若不復活，英在遠東地位，將受日本危害，殊不知日人若出此舉，則適足以促成英美之聯合，而形成日本之自殺，以日人之巧譎，何至見不及此，故英美之恊調雖不易實現，而英日之同盟，可以斷其絶難復活也，且英國自保有餘，爲國際情勢所使然，實無用借重英日之同盟，故此後之國際變化，英美恊調之可能性，實在英日同盟可能性之上，此可無疑者也，又有人以爲英之保守黨，畏俄如蛇蠍，故願恢復英日同盟以敵俄，殊不知英所畏懼者，乃俄之世界革命政策也，今日之俄，固己放棄世界革命政策矣，卽彼與俄毘連之弱之國家，亦不復畏俄，乃謂以英之大，尚畏俄哉，且蘇俄今次加入國聯，英國之力，僅次於法，卽保障蘇俄西疆之東歐公約，亦曾得英之贊同，此非保守黨政府之所爲乎，於此而觀，保守黨畏俄如虎之論，實己隨國際情勢之變遷而失其時宜，故申言之，非特英日同盟之復活，己不可能，且英俄之合作，己微露其端倪矣，此可爲樂觀者二也，再則英法之關係，己逐漸回至戰前合作之陳勢，故包爾温於英國必須擴充空軍之一點上，不言對法，而言英國之國防，應在萊因彼岸，意之所指，不言而喻，蓋今日英國之所懼者，乃爲德國之妄動，蓋德一動，遠東戰禍，亦必繼之而起，英國無論參加與否，皆屬有害而無利，故爲英國計，苟可取得和平，卽使委屈德國，亦所不惜，英人之所以直接力圖遷就法國者以此，間接市惠於蘇俄者亦以此，而英俄之所以尚有合作可能者亦以此，此可爲樂觀者三也，最後美國對於國聯之態度，亦逐漸變更，若能假以時日，竟或步俄之後，加入國聯，亦未可知，是則國聯之力愈厚，和平之希望亦愈大矣。</p>
<p>然欲求東北問題之解决，不外二法，（一）卽國聯會中，各强誠意合作，因而對日實施有效之制裁，（二）爲如英國工黨自由黨之主張，謀英美俄三强之合作，以對日制裁，吾人以爲此二法中，苟能實施其一，卽足屈服日本，世界大戰，從此可免，亦未可知也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">九·一八以後的日蘇關係誨 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>一·日蘇對立的形勢</p>
<p>九一八事變以後，日本與蘇聯的對立，的　是一天緊一天，從前到處潛伏着的危機，都與日俱進而匯集起來了。日本軍國主義者，口頭說是維持遠東和平，其實是由威脅和平，而至於破壞和平，最充公的證明，是日本歷年來軍事豫算的增加，本年度陸海軍預算計九萬三千六百萬圓日金，明年（一九三五年）尚没有確定，財長對軍部所提槪算雖力主削减，但我們相信··陸海雙方，决不肯遷就减少，且還要應付海軍軍縮會議，要穏定東北四省，所以陸海軍都將堅持其主張，則明年度軍事豫算，無論如何，比今年總是大些，恐怕要占歲出總數的百分之五十以上。</p>
<p>這樣的軍事膨脹，感受威脅最大的爲蘇聯，形勢最重的，爲北滿原野，和東西比利亞。在九一八事變以前，日蘇的衝突，並不直接，北海漁業的爭執，也還不致引起重大結果。日本旣席捲北滿而後，表面上是傀儡國出來主持，當責任的實是三位一體的關東軍司令。中東路沿綫，都駐重兵，又在大興嶺山脈一帶建築鋼骨混凝土的保壘，這樣的軍事準備，預算能節縮嗎。</p>
<p>日本的對蘇軍略，原想（不戰而勝）。第一就是乘機奪取中東鐵路，第二是用經濟進攻的方式，把中東路剪成三段，使牠失去經濟上，政治上的價值，逼蘇聯放棄。關於第一項奪取的方式，是運用在東北境内的優秀兵力，和政治上的特殊權利，指使傀儡國出頭，則一切行動，都處於有利地位。關於第二項，日本所運用的方略，用意更深遠了··他知道中東路插入北滿，如不設法佔取，不但爲軍事上大障碍，政治上也有許多意外困難，經濟上更與日本帝國不利，而如欲用第一項政策，究竟非在戰爭前夕，不能出手的。因此他纔决定運用第二種方法，使中東路經濟價值减低，蘇方自不能不向後退却。他所用的方法，是在中東路西部，使洮昻鐵道發揮作用，并與四洮路合作，極力吸收黑龍江的農業産品，更擬於最短期内，完成二站至黑河鐵道，使黑龍江·興安嶺·一帶的出産，都掌握在這兩條鐵道手裏。再則對於移民，着眼點在佳木斯，現在祇有汽車和夏秋季的水上交通，所以很不方便。牡丹江至佳木斯鐵道，己着手興工這條鐵道完成而後則松花江流域的特産，又在日本支配下了，同時吉會路也將次完成，清津·羅津·兩港，匪但爲吉會路的吞吐港，且爲日本海上的重地鎭，該路在東北境内與中東路差不多是平行路綫，在海上大有封鎖海參崴的深意。日軍强佔後之瀋陽義勇軍之馬隊</p>
<p>蘇聯受這種政治上，軍事上的威脅，很不容易用武力解决；而經濟上也處於被動地位，中東路若被剪成三段之後；一切都將滅低價值，蘇聯如要勉强撑持，就非用武力維護不可。然而蘇聯是高標和平主義的，决不願對外挑戰，特别是爲爭中東路而出兵，在戰略上，在實際利益上，都不合算，并且不智。所以决定用出賣中東路手段，以静觀世界政局的變化。由此我們看出日蘇雙方，都勾心鬭角，各自運用其外交妙技，以博取將來不用武力的勝利。</p>
<p>二·將來的揣測</p>
<p>日蘇關係在這種時張時弛狀態中，有的人很懷疑，也有的人很恐懼。懷疑的以爲日蘇關係如何解决，與中國很有關係，我們不能坐視，又不能作若何積極的對應工作；恐懼的是日蘇問題漸次緊張，無論如何延綏，戰爭總不近時期問題，他們雙方誰勝誰負，都與我國没有好處；至具危險性。但這種揣测。都不是他今日根本的企圖。因爲今日如果眞對蘇開戰，卽今以兵力完全佔領了沿海省一帶，至少非出兵一百五十萬不可，占領了這些地方，在事實上，日本的經濟，并没有甚麽利益。最大限也祇有獨霸北海漁業，和西北利亞的一部份森林而己；至於庫頁島北部的石油，日本能否奪取，還是問題。</p>
<p>現在的蘇聯，己和十五年前大不相同，日本一九一九年出兵西比利亞時，遠東共和國，尚且不肯屈服，現在當然會抗戰起來，假使戰爭延長下去，蘇聯的根據，丨丨烏拉爾以西的地方，并没有絲毫損害。日本的陸軍，雖怎樣勇猛，也决不能越赤塔而西，其飛機也不能飛過貝加爾西邊去。反之，如日本不能急速占領海參崴，則赤色空軍勢必將威脅日本的重要都市，日本那樣的建築，如何能抵當燒夷彈的轟炸。日本軍閥雖急於進取，對這類的公算，也是相當清楚的，其所以仍舊盛大宣傳局勢緊張原原因，是爲了要打穏佔東北四省的軍事政治的基礎。日本在國際外交上，憤然退出國聯，於己並無所利，且蘇聯近己正式加入國聯，國際形勢，必將有一大轉變，日本於此，當然不能再任意　預下去了</p>
<p>日本攻擊西比利亞的政策，旣不能行，殆將轉换方向，西進以圖取得羊毛的産原地乎，内蒙古雖多沙漠，而漠南地區，却富水草，并且可以不費什麽重大兵力，更用不着什麽精銳武器，祇須政治上略施手腕，就可以暢所欲爲，如果達到目的，還有更重要的棉花生産地帶，可以奪取。此乃日本基礎工業的主要需求，縱出重大犧牲，也是值得，何况他估量當前的局勢，自己的力量，自以爲不必用武力而可以穏取的，當此日蘇關係複雜化之際，我們應該充分注意，愼防日本聲東擊西的政策。</p>

<h3 id="c5">九一八事變三年後的日本明 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>日本雖是一個後起的資本主義國家，他國内市塲還有發展的餘地，國外市塲在鄰近的，更有開拓的可能：但是他自一九二九年以來，所受經濟恐慌的惡影響不小，一般人民生活，直接感受着巨大的威脅，卽普通的産業資本家，也莫不痛苦呻吟於（不景氣）之下。所以在一九三一年夏季，纔决定發動一個震動世界，空前未有的大事變，這一事變，對日本國内的作用有三：第一是借此開拓日本的經濟領域，擴大其獨占市塲；第二是以非常時期應舉國一致去鎭服他國内的恐慌，壓迫所謂民主政治，抛棄議會鬥爭，實施軍部獨裁；第三是因軍事開拓的結果，大量移民可以實現，則恐慌的克服，産業更生，都將一齊湧現，則日本帝國主義，可以大大發展起來。</p>
<p>然而九一八事變以後，其實際情形如何，日本所得究竟怎樣，是否確如他自己所想望的？我們於創深痛鉅之餘，看看自己之外，也看看敵方到底何如。日本在遠東的特殊經濟領域誠然是擴大了，獨占事業的發達也超大戰以前的德國而過之。并且因爲非常時期的加緊，獨占的勢力越見開展，東北境内固然要讓三井，三菱，住友，等等財閥去經營，卽其國内的工業，如造船廠，製鐵廠，硫酸廠，化學工廠，都直接間接與軍事有關，得到很大的利益。例如可作軍需工業原料的：銑鐵的生産（一九義勇軍之司令部前</p>
<p>三三年比一九三二年）增加了百分之三一，鋼在同一時期增加百分之二六，硫黄增加百分之三十四。化學工業如苛性蘇達增加了百分之四九·五。蘇逹粉增加百分之四九·八。石灰淡氣增加了百分之三九·四。晒粉增加百分之三八·四。這些情形都是日本産業界活躍的因素，是市面好轉的來原。但是實際上得到利益的資産家，直接與軍需工業的關的，或間接有關，露着所謂（景氣）的，爲數不過三千，這三千人中，當然包含得有那些獨占的産業和金融資本家在内。其餘的勞苦羣衆是欲求温飽而不可得，普通的産業資本家，也仍要受經濟恐慌的壓迫。</p>
<p>議會政治在日本原來没有什麽力量，民主立憲在日本政治上并不曾表現過功績；他的政治形態，獨裁的傾向，在歐洲大戰後，民主思想盛極一時的期間，依舊存留着。最近幾年，經濟恐慌遍及於世界，日本要想脫出這一恐慌，自必盡力運用經濟的獨占，强化金融資本的勢力。政治行動，也走同樣的道程，高揭起非常時期的大旗，使一般國民都在軍國號召之下，一致活動。春秋兩季陸軍大演習以外，還有海軍的大演習，近來更有大阪·東京·兩地的防空大演習，使合體國民都緊張起來，帶着濃厚的戰爭意識，以轉移其國民對生活上痛苦的咀嚼。但是一般人民，特别是都市上的産業工人，和農村裏的中小農民，因過分勞作的結果，都一息奄奄，毫無生氣，於所謂非常時期，所謂舉國一致，似乎没有什麽關係。祇覺着生活的壓迫是高過一切精神的激刺。</p>
<p>移民到（滿洲）去，是日本挑動九一八事變主要目的之一，他認爲東北三省那樣廣博的沃野，加以二十八年來日本的苦心經營，則移民到東北去應該没有問題；何况還增加了許多設備，軍事的保護，交通的開發，以及經濟實際的援助，凡是移到東三省去的日本人，都由其政府指定銀行，貸與一千日金以至二千日金的欵項，便其經營農業。并且在吉林的佳木斯劃出移民區，組織武裝移民團，日政府對之不但貸與欵項，并且還發給自衛的武器，如步槍，輕機關槍之類。其保護可謂週密，設計也不能算是不工細了。但從九一八到如今，武裝移民團組織時期不過二千人，而逃回日本去的就超過三分之一。這種移民計劃爲什麽會失敗呢？第一是東北氣候，不宜於日本人的生活；第二農業經營是最苦的工作，尤其東北佳木斯那種半開墾的區域，日人更難於忍受；第三是東北種稻的區域并不大，而紅糧大豆的耕作都不是日本農人所素習的。所以他用了很大的氣力去移民，結果祇移去了兩千多的知識分子至傀儡國作官，這一般官吏大多數人因爲運用毒化政策的關係，自身也染上了毒質，變作烟鬼色鬼的也不少。</p>
<p>日本侵略的結果，在他國内很到實際利益，祇是三千大資本家，安插到傀儡國去的，也不過幾千落魄的知識份子；但是要用大兵十二萬來從事保護，并且都是戰時裝備。這是加重了一般人民的負担，的確是爲極少人的方便，而犧牲他全國民的利益；直到現在不但要繼續　頇下去，而且還要加深其程度。</p>
<p>日本雖號稱爲新進的工業國家，但其農家户數有五百六十三萬，人口有二千八百萬；所以農村經濟依舊占着很重要的地位。今年生絲跌價，將來暢銷的希望也很少，春蠶收獲，在農民方面的收入，單是繭子的跌價一項就要損失三萬五千萬日金。因此一般農村都陷入於饑餓的苦境：尤其是米價高漲以後，在表面上，大農似乎得了多少好處，可是日本的農民有二百六十三萬户以上是耕地不滿一町步（一四·八畝）的中小農，他們每年收入，僅敷溫飽，很少剩餘，歴年來，農産物市塲價格極度下落的結果，佃農因然是疲敝不堪，自耕農也同樣的焦頭爛額，現在還要把去年賤價賣榖的錢高價買米來吃。從前日本農村經濟一貫繭子，一包米，是合法而又合理的經濟組織，那時候的農民祇曉得勞工神聖，不知道經濟恐慌：現有則辛苦勞動的工作結果，竟至於吃不飽了！</p>
<p>本年六月底，日本帝國農會調查農家食米不足最少百分之十五以至於百分之三十；而事它上的食米缺乏却大得多，特别是養蠶地方食米不足，竟有至於百分之八十的。例如茨城縣石城郡（依據該郡農會調查），一萬四千零八十七户農民中，缺乏食米的有六千二十一户，占該郡農户的百分之四十四。又如長野縣南佐久郡，農民雖努力於所謂農村自力更生，農家大都至於吃麥飯；小麥還没有完全成熟，就勉强開始割來吃，剛打下來就賣出去的也不少。茨城縣猿島郡的静村，　村四百七十户人家，差不多都食米不足。長野縣所屬的地方，有些竟至於吃樹根，吃草實！比較四年前嚴重得多，如小學敎員拿不着薪金，遲繳租稅等己經是極普遍的見慣不驚的事了。這不過舉其概略中的槪略，以見一斑而己。岡田内閣成立後，曾提議將政府手裏的存米，賣給民間，實際上這并不能减輕農民的饑　，因爲她并不是把米糧贈送與農民，也不是借貸，而是較廉價的出賣：殊不知一般農民籌一圓也很艱難，買米吃，自然更感痛苦了。農村經濟旣然如此頽敗，城市工業，也祇限於經營軍需工業的一小部分資本家：而最大多數的人民，都浮施於（不景氣）的浪潮中：因爲生活動搖，所以一般思想也同其激變，不論是極右的國粹黨，極左的共産黨，都對現狀表示不滿，并且各有反動的行爲，致現狀更加不安。血盟團一類的極右團體，自五·一五犬養事件發生後，檢舉了好多人，其活動力漸見减少了。左傾的思想潛行運動，蔓延得特别廣泛，在一般工人，農民當中自然傳染得很快，日政府頗不容易取締，其所取締的，不過是一部分的有知識靑年，及對出版的限制而己。上層社會中貴族子女，也多深染惡化思想，同情於革命，甚至有許多人，實際參加。不啻表明日本自身内在的矛盾，從現實生活到恩想，都在激劇的轉變，這確是日本的隠憂。</p>

<p>（日内瓦）中國出席國聯大會首席代表駐英公使郭泰祺頃發表談話、對於中國連選行政院非常任理事遭國聯大會否决一事、表示失望、郭氏謂就目前環境、國聯大會應與中國以連選行政院理事之權此後中國不能出席行政院、深恐違東局勢將因此益臻嚴重云云、若干中國報紙雖曾提及、如中國不能連任理事、則有退出國聯會之可能、但此間人士相信中國不致出於此舉、又大會關於中國連選行政院非常任理事之程序如下、中國須得大會三分之二之多數通過、方可有連選權、如中國連選權己獲三分之二之多數、則於選舉非常任理事時、僅須過半數卽可當選、如是則中國必能獲選、使土耳其落選、自屬無疑、今中國旣未得三分之二这多數、則以過半數獲得非常任理事亞洲一席、自惟土耳其而己、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨國聯大會開會時、大會休息室中談話、大部分關於中國與土耳其競選行政院非常任理事一事、大會各代表對於中國連選一事、意見分爲兩派、若干代表主張信守因中日爭端中國聯所採取之政策大　、贊成中國連選、但其他代表則専就歐洲政治觀念加以考慮、故多偏向土耳其、迨中國連選遭否决後、在塲諸人頗爲震動、大會中若干代表團旣反對中國連選、一般人以爲對於準常任理事國西班牙與波蘭之連選、亦將一併反對、因此中國連選遭否决、或恐影響於西班牙之連選、迨西班牙連選獲得三分二多數通過後、羣疑始釋、至此土耳其爲非常任理事亞洲一席之唯一候選國、其當選自不成問題、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>是（供）和（求）的關係、供求適當　社會就是安寗、供求不適當、不論供過於求、或求過於供、社會都要發生恐慌、怎樣能求供的調劑適當、最要緊的、恐怕就是運輸一點、因爲生産者、必須要有便利的運輸、纔能把貨品運送出去、銷售者也必須要有便利的運輸、纔能把貨品推銷出去、達到消費者的手裏、所以要調整供求的關係、必須要生産者·運輸者·和銷售者、充分的密切的合作鐵路是大規模的運輸機關、對於運銷兩方、都如手臂相聯、分拆不開、因此本路以運輸者的地位、屢次和工商各界商量合作的方法、結果、訂定了沿綫各站産運銷合作辦法綱要、作爲施行的根據、其中屬於本路應從事合作的事項、有一欵是（在有大宗貨品産銷之地方特派人員指導或代辦貨運手續、）關於代辦貨運手續、本路己經在上海静安寺路·十六舗·及南京太平路、設有營業所擔任這項工作、關於指導貨運手續、雖則本路刋有章則、可供大家參考、但其經過的順序、與運費的計算、尤其是負責貨運比較繁複、恐大家不易明瞭、所以特地請諸位到此、由車務人員替諸位解釋、使諸位充分明瞭　免除一切隔膜與誤會、我們除口頭說明貨運手續以外、還要陪同諸位到上北站和麥根路站實地參觀一下、使</p>
<p>目來看　達到澈底明瞭的地步、這可以說是産運銷事作　開始的一步、也是重要的上步、至於本路進一步恊助客商辦理貨運酌設施、擬再積極推進大要如下、（甲）在各大站所在地、添設營業所　便利客商接洽（乙）在内地設立貨運代辦所、作爲營業所的分辦事處、使内地運出或運入貨品、得到充分的便利、（丙）自明年起實行沿綫各站營業所化、即凡是營業所辦理的主要工作、責成各站同樣辦理、這個旨趣、是希望把本路轉運貨物的組織　好像身使臂臂使指、有一貫的系統、收　活的效果、也就是希望産銷運合作一　、可因此能進一步的由理想而逐漸見諸事實、其次再說說、我們將來的希望、美國有一種呌做運輸聯歡社、（TrafficClub）是一般託運人和承運人聯合組織的、凡是託運人有不明瞭的地方、或有困難的地方、可以呌承運人解釋或幫助、反之、承運人有需要託運人恊助的地方也可以商辦、這種組織、眞是合作最好的方法、美國還有一種呌做託運人建議委員會、（ＳhippersAdvis）</p>
<p>oryBaorp）是完全由託運人組織的、凡遇對於運輸機關不滿意或希望攺進的問題、就由委員會共同研究提出意見、向運輸機關建議、這種足以免除雙方隔閡的辦法　也是合作最好的例證、本路這一次招持客商解釋貨運手續、雖則没有像美國那樣形式上的組織、却也含有一部份同樣的作用　希望諸位在研究貨運手續以外、儘量的提出問題、貢獻意見、以便共同攺進運輸業務、實爲至幸、完了、</p>

<p>坡督金文泰、自從卸任香港總督、於一九二九年五月就任星加坡督兼馬來各帮欽差大臣之後、五年中的施政舉措、就犖犖大者說、像增加國防金、地方分權、海關聯合、取締中國國民黨、以馬來文語爲基本敎育、提倡種稻、救濟膠錫、當地工業化······之類、偉劃雄圖、虎視海峽、各種政策己著的得失、和未來的影響、直接有關英國殖民地的政治軍事經濟諸　利害、我們不必越俎代謀、何况金文泰爵士憑着主觀的見解、於未奉准辭職之前、在英倫演說席上、自述其治理馬來亞的政績、正爲博取彼邦朝野的公評　不是我們中國人所能容喙、獨有取締中國國民黨活動一事、其發言離事實太遠、我們對這個問題、好似骨　在喉、本來早想有所聲述、祇因當局旣無有宣佈其所以取締的理由、而海峽殖民地的星加坡乃三Ｓ線之樞紐、英帝國視爲應付太平洋風雲的前哨重鎭、居留當地及馬來聯邦的華僑達一百七十餘萬、開荒墾植、繁榮斯土、歷史悠久、功績最多、聰明的英國當局　應無歧視或鄙夷的道理、當此遠東危機日顯、金氏受英皇重任、所以我們本着共存共榮的信念、逆來順受、一時未便驟加論列、最近金氏在英倫對中國國民黨提出六端、公開指摘、我們始恍然他所提之理由、不過如是、而英皇復批准金氏辭職、足見他的政策和見解、不一定能氏表英國政府、於是增加我們商討的機會、特地根據客觀的事實、平心静氣就金氏的指各點、予以理智的解剖、使國内外人士知道金氏對中國國民黨和中國民族尚未有充分的認識、</p>

<p>要討論中國國民黨在英屬馬來亞活動的問題、應該把本黨過去的演變、略略的追憶一下、因凡百事物的活動歷程、自有其連續關係、决不是憑空而至的、誰都知道、中國國民黨的前身爲中華革命黨、爲同盟會、爲興中會、當初的革命志士、實因清室倒行逆施、辱國喪權、服見國内各民族同師於盡、所以發生民族革命的動念、當時海外華僑、不忍祖國危亡、大聲疾呼、一唱百和、對革命進行、精神上、物質上、盡力資助、最早在星加坡、檳城、吉隆坡、怡保、芙蓉等地、組織三點會、這種結社、始於清初、盛於清末、宗旨在復明滅清、後來孫中山先生到了南洋、和許多派别紛歧的志士、如義興會、義福會、福興會、海山會、廣福會等、以及鄭成功太平天國先後失內亡命的黨、聲氣相通　共謀光復、於是海外志士都追隨孫先生、加入同盟會、愛國僑胞、輸財出力的、更盛極一時、像星加坡方面的同德書報社·晚晴園·吉隆坡怡保的新攺良商號·决醒園·文明閣檳城之小蘭亭心·廣園·閱書報社·都是人才薈萃的所在、各地分會、近的如瓜拉比拉·芙蓉·蔴坡······遠的到仰光·荷印·海防·暹維·都散滿了反清的革命同志、民國元年、攺爲國民黨後、在星加坡設國民黨交通部、各埠設以分部、民國三年後、攺中華革命黨、組織更爲光大、海峽殖民地政府、雖曾加以注意、但在霹靂森美蘭·彭亨·雪蘭莪·四個馬來聯邦、依正當法律、請求註册、均得許可、一直公開到一九二五年、堂堂正正的合法行動、没有半點危害到當地治安秩序、所以一九二四年攺組成中國國民黨後、除馬來聯邦的公開黨部外、依然可以半公開的活動、在此數十年的歷程、本黨總理係中山先生、及其他本黨的重要人員、在馬來亞地方、奔走領導、出入策劃、均極自由、當地有名僑胞參加活動、亦無阻礙、殖民地當局或冷静旁觀、或暗加呵護、從來没有嚴厲制裁與解散、直到金氏繼任總督始、才把中國國民當加一個非法團體的名詞、實行取締、此種歷史的事實、可以證明國民黨的活動、無絲毫妨害、居留政府的存心、况且歷任星加坡總督、對國民黨的活動、並不驚異、未必皆不如金氏聰明　實因金氏忽略這種歷史事實、才不免少見多怪吧、</p>
<h3 id="c190">（三）金氏指摘國民黨六點與疑問 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>金氏演說詞中指摘國民黨的一段說、（國民黨之在馬來半島設立、乃與當地法律抵觸者、但一九三○年起、却公然活動、大作政治上之宣傅工作、且鼓勵當地之華僑、授彼等以反英之思想、國民黨在馬來亞活動之目的、</p>
<p>（一）將全馬來亞華僑組織起來</p>
<p>（二）挑剔虐待華僑之法律</p>
<p>（三）投資農業實業及商業之種種活動</p>
<p>（四）將全數華校置在黨治之下</p>
<p>（五）自編學校敎科書灌輸反英思想</p>
<p>（六）以甘地及不合作之運動爲磅樣、實行馬來華僑與政府不合作舉動、此外更利用華字報章爲宣傳利器、使報館主人大受壓迫、而勞工僱主們、亦受相同之壓迫、總而言之、中國國民黨馬來亞支部之活動目的、乃破壞全體當地華僑師順英政府之忠心······）</p>
<p>關於第一點、所謂（將全體華僑組織起來）語、不知何指、若云（組織）、則非惡名亦非壞事、壞的組織、在光明正大的中國國民黨向不屑爲、好的（組織）、則如上面所述——同德書報社·晚晴園·新攺良商號·决醒園·文明閣·小蘭亭·心廣圜·閱書報社等、大都以切磋學識　努力公益愛護國家爲旨趣、至於舊有之華僑（組織）——如各地中華商會、各種職業組合、福建廣府潮州瓊州客屬等會館、以及三邑四邑及某縣同鄕會和家族團體等等、有的屬地方性質、有的具宗族意義、均不外聯絡情感、互敦親誼、不獨毫無政治作用、且其成立歷史、有在國民黨創立以前十年或數百年的、總之、一華僑組織、無論新的舊的、要皆經過當地政府立案註册種種手續、才能成立、那末、（將全體華僑組織起來）一語、不知金氏爲虚搆的、或爲實指的、但我們若以國民黨資格來自省、覺得無此力量、實在萬分慚愧、至於在國民黨以前成立的華僑團體、歷史久遠、我們安敢貪功、殖民地政府應該有判斷的智慧、</p>
<p>關於第二點所謂（挑剔虐等華僑的法律）（虐待）二字、如果不是金氏自己流露於不自覺、我們殊不敢武斷殖民地政府對華僑有此存心、因爲英屬馬來亞政府在海峽殖民地内、對禽獸保護、尚且設有専門機關、不准任人虐待、豈有對於同是人類的華僑、在順受統治之下、反而不加愛惜、金氏提出虐待二字、適以自形其短、國民黨固不擔負甚麽罪名、恐英皇聞此、必爲不樂、虐待的事實有無、還是一個問題、根本没有此事、我們從何挑剔、如果有的話、不獨中國國民黨的中國國民黨注意、恐怕也爲堂堂大英法治所不許、</p>
<p>關於第三點（投資農業實業及商業之種種活動）、我們要問繁榮馬來亞地方、是否祇限定某一種人或某一國人投資、我們華僑是否配經營馬來亞的實業、從過去的歷史與現行的律例都尋不出這種根據、馬來亞由草昧時代、經過若干年和自然界奮鬥、才開發出來今日的繁榮、誰都公認是華僑的智力、體力、膽力、與英殖民地政府的政治力合作所致、且查我們華僑先人的南渡　遠在晋朝者不必說、就拿十五世紀初鄭和七次下南洋來說、足跡己較己較歐西人士先到一百多年、當時烟瘴叢莽、人獸雜居、華僑憑着冒險的天性、創造的精神、吃苦耐勞的毅力、一刀一斧胼手胝足、替後來的人開出一片樂土來、這不是我們自誇的、二十年前的坡督瑞恩登曾說過、（白人未到馬來以前、華人己在這裏開礦捕魚、經商墾植、等到白人一到、大興土木、從事建設、全靠華人力量、行政費用、　金靠此挹注、華人初來此地、大都深入叢莽　芟除荒穢、冒艱險以獲厚利、雖中暑遇瘴、死者無數、但終能戰勝自然、爲治工、爲樵夫、爲陶工、爲建築家、文化和物質兩建設、都出其乎、又投巨資組織汽船公司、以利交通、招致工人、開發地利、政府得從而稅之、佔地方財政總收入之十分之九······）、再最近（前年）吉隆坡農産展覽會中、金氏於開幕時在華僑廣衆中演說、亦曾諄諄以居民努力發展農事、振興稻茶、烟葉、等業爲勸、並以馬來産品十九爲原料、日用熟貨、不必遠求、期望當地能實行工業化、一面預備在新加坡工部局管轄的西部、收買私人産業闢爲工廠區域、凡願創立工廠者、政府皆可特别通融、由此看來、華僑從前對馬來亞經濟繁榮的貢獻旣如此之大、英屬政府現在的鼓勵獎　又復如此之殷、那末投資當地實業、確有裨於當地人民生計、充裕政府財庫收入、人地兩益、今金氏在倫敦指摘華僑投資經營實業、豈不是前後判若兩人、這種自相予盾、如何解釋、（未完）</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>秋夜。</p>
<p>從敞開的窗口，夜風不時地吹送着陣陣的榖香，黄老太太内心裏飄上一種說不出口的快活，她感謝老天爺，今年又有一個好收成。但是緊接着她就想起來了件舊事，口裏在重念着：　（可别像去年那樣啊。）</p>
<p>去年收成很好，可是糧米都賣不上價錢，儘是日本子搗的鬼，硬把糧價壓低，屯裏莊稼人十家有九家賠了老本。至於她黄老太太，雖然不指望種地過日子，自己第年總要從地户身上分一點糧米的，豐收年頭，她可以多分幾石，糧價再大些，她不是可以積儲幾個錢麽。</p>
<p>黄老太太並不是愛錢如命的守財奴，不過是環境所逼，她就不得不有這種小小的奢望了。</p>
<p>（咳！······）</p>
<p>咳了一聲，她又嘆起好苦如黄蓮的命運。好模好樣一個家庭，她自己，還有兩個兒子，大兒子討了媳婦，還生個孫女，她只待二兒子也討上媳婦，就算完成了當媽的事業，她可以享一點老來薄福。可是命運不濟（黄老太太是非常相信命運的），大兒子在長春軍隊上當着小官，正待進取光宗時，日本兵忽然逞凶佔了長春，她的兒子就在那一次交兵中喪了生命。是她自己身上落下的一塊肉啊，哪能不心痛呢，後來聽到信息，她哭得死去活來，幸好還有一個兒子在，算是在悲痛中還能給她一點慰藉，她勸着兒媳，讓兒媳把一切希望都放在小叔身上，將來小叔能够成名，一定能有當嫂子的後福享。然而，事情是越來越不對，二兒子隨着哥哥的死亡，就出奔了。是偷着走的，留給黄老太太一封簡單的信，說是入夥當義勇軍去，去殺日本兵，爲哥哥，爲别人報仇雪恥，收復失地。於是，黄老太太就像從天堂跌到地獄裏一樣，什麽希望都没有了，有的只是再也洗不去的重苦痛。</p>
<p>她處處都是爲别人設想的，尤其是對地的兒媳，她覺得太對不過她了，年靑靑的守了寡，而且此後連個盼望都没有，多麽難過！她有一回就跟兒媳直接了當地說：</p>
<p>（你不用憂愁，事情到了這步田地，憂愁也没有用，我看是這樣，你自己隨便罷。）</p>
<p>兒媳並没有聽她的話，還是守着女兒過着生活。</p>
<p>（明天又是那個日子了？）</p>
<p>黄老太太抛却了鼻孔中的榖香，丢下了傷心的回憶，順手摸過一本曆書，放到燈前去看，是的，明天正是那個日子，險些讓他忘過去了。她把曆書中翻看的一頁，折了一個記號，那裏，清清楚楚印着黑地白字的石印字：</p>
<p>（九月十八日。）</p>
<p>她合上曆書，向外屋喊道：</p>
<p>（小蘭來。）</p>
<p>一個五六歲的女孩子，蹦蹦跳跳跑進來，一面問：</p>
<p>（奶奶，幹什麽？）</p>
<p>（你媽呢？）</p>
<p>（我媽？）</p>
<p>（是呀。）</p>
<p>（她，丨丨她躺着呢。）</p>
<p>黄老太太明白了，急急地說：</p>
<p>（去，喊你媽去，說我找她有事情。）</p>
<p>孩子走了，黄老太太眼眶中冒出來熱涙。明天，九月十八日，正是他大兒子三年前在長春兵營殉難的日子。三週年了，日子過的眞快。　把眼晴擦擦，望望窗口外面，外面是重重的黑暗，黄老太太簡直不敢看了，趕忙閉緊了眼睛。她把外面的黑暗想到她們家裏後日黑暗無光的情形了。</p>
<h3 id="c218">東北義勇軍 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>在九一八事變第三週年來臨之際，筆者藉此來談談紅胳臂這一問題，想來　者們不至於目爲無意義的吧。</p>
<p>（紅胳臂是什麽？）一定的你們先要這麽問一句。是的，我要先來解說這個名詞。</p>
<p>紅胳臂，用不到引經舉典，多所論列，一句話，就是在東北抗日的義勇軍！因爲他們是在袖子上（也就是胳臂上）纒着一條紅帶子作標誌的。</p>
<p>據說，去年是紅胳臂走惡運的年頭，可是今年却大有轉機了。這是有來歴的，我的一個紅胳臂朋友，最近由東北過來，他告訴我這内中的情况。</p>
<p>說起去年紅胳臂走惡運，還不外受到日本人的害處。日本人對老百姓們宣稱綫胳臂是土匪，（一向就這樣蒙蔽，欺騙着老百姓們）是擾亂人民的，是人民的公敵，所以，人民如能設法自衛，與紅胳臂作殊死戰，如能擒到一個人，就照章獎賞一些金錢。一般老百姓們，國家觀念非常薄弱，從來喜歡過私家安逸生活的，這一來，爲了貪圖金錢，爲了保持安逸奘態，自然就需要和紅胳臂爲難，作對了，所以，凡是紅胳臂所到地方，那些老百姓們没有不憑藉自家武器迎頭痛擊的。逼得没有辦法，處處立不住脚步，於是這些困苦的紅胳臂們，只有入山暫避，以野草果實飽腹了。</p>
<p>那時候，單身綫胳臂，没有人敢在鄕間路上出現，不然就隨處都有傷害生命的危險。</p>
<p>那一時，日本兵不需親身出馬，就制伏住四鄕義勇軍的活動。</p>
<p>百姓們和紅胳臂們兩家成了仇敵。</p>
<p>可是今年，情形就大大不同，因爲日本本旣然在春天到處繳收民間槍枝。且又硬收地契，百姓們的生路，無異逼至絶路，於是，走頭無路，入地無門，隨即挺而走險了；從前和紅胳臂作對的人們，現在反倒作了紅胳臂，兩方面變成了難兄難弟。</p>
<p>紅胳臂今年旣然走了好運’行動上也就很有些便利地方，老百姓們，就算没有加入組織以内的，至少，對於紅胳臂的印象也有了攺變，他們不但和紅胳臂互通空氣，而且還在可能範圍内，樂於供給紅胳臂一些應用物品。</p>
<p>這也明有淵源的，今春日兵旣然繳盡東北民槍，於是入夏以來，紅胳臂所到之處，即或是眞正土匪所到之處，人民都束手無策，不能抵禦了。這是人民苦衷之一。還有，鄕間報警，日兵從不下鄕衛護，等鄕間紅胳臂退走後，日本兵才能開到，但這是没有好處的，他們不是抓去幾個人，誣爲私通土匪，就是把當地房屋全行焚燬，這樣的虐迫，逼迫，就給與紅胳臂一種擴大勢力的機會。</p>
<p>如今，單身的紅胳臂，不帶武器，可以隨便走着路，只要不遇見日本兵，走到什麽地方都不會再遇到人民的暗算。</p>
<p>這是鐵一般的事實！</p>
<p>紅胳臂的發展，只有和老百姓聯在一起才能靠得住，才是有希望，有生路的。現在日本兵不敢下鄕搜勦，正是這種道理。</p>
<p>這裏是一件頗爲滑稽的事情：現下東北市鄕的保安隊警察隊，他們的袖子上原是圍着一條黄帶子標誌的，是屬於（滿洲）國的，人們稱他們爲黄胳臂。近來，在黄底的背面换成了紅色的底子，這是有一種方便處：如果遇到紅胳臂開過來，他們就把典胳臂標誌翻一個面，爲的還可以免去紅胳臂們的非難。</p>
<p>或者有人以爲現在東北義勇軍的發展，己經到了停頓時期，甚而還有人否認義勇軍的存在，這，筆者是不敢苟同的。義勇軍的人數多寡，没有關係，發展的綏急，也没有關係，最重要的是他們堅固不拔的信心丨丨意志丨丨也就是主義！過去那些抗日的義軍，有的被收買，有的被出賣，都成過去了，都提不起來了。至於現在的紅胳臂，可說是眞正抗日的武士，惟有他們，旣不要錢，又不要名舉！他們更能耐苦，他們惟一的任務就是：</p>
<p>（誓死反抗　日本帝國主義的武裝侵略！）</p>
<p>祝紅胳臂的勝利，我們可以說：</p>
<p>（紅胳臂是眞正抗日　的農民義勇軍。）</p>

<h3 id="c220">憶閬中（下） <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 川人</p>
<p>我心下納悶，想問一問其中究竟來，可是没有人敢回答我。我只得會了茶賬，低着頭走出館子，一直向桓侯祠進發。</p>
<p>說起桓侯祠來，眞是大大有名！誰不知道閬中郡是三國時代蜀漢名將張飛的鎭守之邦！一直到現在，張老爺仍是赫赫有震的。去年赤匪攻到嘉陵江對岸，與官軍只是一水之隔了。城裏富家闊人想逃難，而又猶疑不决，便請張老爺降壇扶乩，請張老爺回話，替他們决定。張老爺很堅决地回說：（赤匪决不會渡不進城，你們不必倉皇逃避，咱老爺城存與存城亡與亡，你們放心好了！）因此，所有官紳富豪，莫不聽命，大家都很願意的在張老爺的陰靈庇護之下，决不出走。後來赤匪果然没有渡江，自然也並未進城，就退下去了。於是在萬衆歡呼之下，替張老爺洗澡换新衣，燒香磕頭的，接踵而至，到底因爲民窮財盡的原故，並没有替張老爷重整廟貌，這是　邑人士至今耿耿於心的！</p>
<p>桓侯之殿，據說還是宋時的建築；他的眞像，據說是逼肖其人。</p>
<p>矮矮的身軀，黑蒼蒼的面孔，兩隻幾乎要暴出來的圓眼睛，我們這些並未生長在蜀漢時代的人，無從判斷其逼肖與否，不過神像塑得頗平易可親，並不像戲台上那樣古怪可怕。神像後便是墓碑，墓塜恰恰築在殿後，塜身當然是很高大的，有人告訴我，墳内祇有張飛的屍身，其首級被范疆張達等割了携到雲陽縣，後來便在雲陽葬了。所以張老爺死後寳在是身首異處的。</p>
<p>這些，也都不在話下。</p>
<p>關於閬中的土産，有一首寳塔訣爲證，其訣云：</p>
<p>（醋，皮蛋，半夏麯，白糖蒸　，五香豆腐乾，四川陸軍中將，）其最後一個代表，未免有一點兒幽默性，可是陸軍中將是屬於四川的，這也是實際如此，並非有意爲土産鼓吹也。</p>
<p>臨走，我們本來還想看看唐代詩人所盛稱的什麽魯王靈夔之宫，滕王元嬰之苑一類的名蹟，可是我們兩日内心裏所受的創痕己深了，不願再去受騙了。因此，閬中所給我的回憶，僅僅是如此而己！</p>
<h3 id="c221">鄕長先生（四） <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>鄕警冬生，在高頭拐了過來。瘸了一隻手，五個指頭全截成寸長，像薑節似。但以前却是個打油廠裏拿撞木的舵手。力量可也不少。二百斤大樹從山頭背到山脚，可不用（短柱）的。現在，似乎有點衰老，力氣賣不出，祇有來當這慣吃兵老爺底（洋火腿）（錫茄烟）的鄕警！</p>
<p>（這鳥勾當，可不是人當的！）無可奈何中，冬生瘸手是這麽歎氣着。（然而自己竟當了！噯！自己是早不成個人了！狗！）</p>
<p>冬生瘸手像條給人們潑了一瓢熱水在背上，因而脫光了毛的癩狗，在街高頭踱來。</p>
<p>（冬生瘸手！冬生瘸手！）馮文先生突然呌了出來。自己傾聽着自己呌聲，倒也有點像鄕長口吻。於是沉下臉，低低地怪不好意思的，然而似乎是必須如此莊嚴的呌聲：（來！）</p>
<p>瘸着隻手的冬生，也就瘸着脚似的，拐過來。</p>
<p>（什麽，阿文！）論輩分，冬生是叔，文先生是姪。呌聲阿文，似乎也不罪過。然而，不，馮文先生心裏還是起了句國駡：（他媽的！）接着：</p>
<p>（你把那些個告示貼出去嗎？）</p>
<p>（是那）一批的？瘸手的冬生，斜起一隻肩，站住。（現在告示也眞多。今朝什麽隊，明天什麽軍。······你說是那一批的。）</p>
<p>（就是那勸喻壯丁去當後備兵的。）馮文先生這口氣自覺頗爲沉着，大方，正像區長跟自己說話那麽樣的。</p>
<p>（哦！哦！就是抽壯丁那一張嗎？）鄕警科生閉了閉眼，會心似地笑。（這是春天做大萝，没人去的，没人去的，誰高去送命，貼不到一天，早給他們撕去了！）</p>
<p>（撕去了！）鄕長跳了起來，立刻想到自己是被人立過正的身分。（這不行，這不行，這　成，是你和我的。你能擔得起這干係嗎？我家裏還有一張，你給我再貼出去·！再貼出去！</p>
<p>馬文先生又回頭轉到家裏去。鄕警冬生在他後面拐。</p>

<p>十二月期新標凖同時　做</p>
<p>金市昨因財部覆令己到、經前晚金凿公會深夜召集會議後、决定十二月新標準亦同時開做、惟成交不多、一天市况疲軟而平庸晨初以海外銀市英升而美平、倫敦生金跌一便士半、匯兌開升而收降、差度有限、美棉跌八磅音、美麥略縮，股票升降俱微、報載法財長馬旦表示、法國預算殊爲平衡、决不致放棄金本位、並表示世界不久將覺黄金之穏固同幣基礎、實爲匯兌之唯一基本、而將恢復平時關係等訊、但金市因十一月及十二月期間之糾紛、市面頓呈混亂狀態、又趨於停市狀况者頗久、直至十時半以後、疑團纔釋、十二月期亦同時開始、唯乏成交、有行而無市、價較十一月期低一元平、預做最高價爲九六零元、提摸不定、十一月期正式上塲殊穏、迨後銀行缺乏買胃、匯市突鬆、遂起賣風、塲内籌碼亦少、一時缺乏買户而跌、但趁低尚多補空之流、午刻呈平穏狀態、後市上塲尚穏、然因銀行胃口趨塞、大户連續脫手而疲、但孟買電告下跌一安那及勿動尚有回升、無何銀行一再塞出、内盤鬆、供過於求而又低、最後孟買雖回升一安那及勿動之說、市况己轉清平、今將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開爲九五四元、（時己十點半後）較上週六延期時回升一元、大德成等賣到三元四角、慶餘同春福興永大興永則進、當升至五元、匯市平常、福安福餘元茂永賣出、退至三元半、福興永源興元昌永等尚進、升至四元八角、華商求塞九月份三十五元半未獲、兆豐昌德康福興永元茂永大德成乾昌祥大興永等俱賣、嗬囒出來十月份美金五六二五、而跌至一元、同泰昌恒餘趁低進至一元、華比出來十月份美金五六二五、散户尚賣、退至一元二角、華商求結十月份美金五六二五未獲、乾昌祥同泰昌恒餘大德成森昌永等連袂購條、漲爲二元六角、華比出來十月份美金半元、盈豐恒等尚賣、又降爲一元七角、散户補進、日昌等亦納、午收又升爲九五三元三角</p>

<p>自從東北失陷，轉眼倐己三年，也許有人早把（國難）置諸腦後，卽使未忘，也許還不明白自九一八以來日人在東北究竟幹些什麽？可是，我今祇略舉他們一些建設成績，來給我國做個對照。且看今日之東北，究是誰家之天下？</p>
<p>九一八以前的南滿鐵路，祇有一一二九公里長，但現在添築路綫業己增到三五九五公里長，比兩年前加兩倍，同時，滿鐵公司的資本，也增加起來，自四萬萬元增到八萬萬元。</p>
<p>除南滿路綫外，還有築成新的鐵路六九五公里。</p>
<p>公路建築，就己完成的說，己有五十五條，計六八，○○里。</p>
<p>港灣方面，如大連，安東，營口，以及羅津，清津，雄基等港，現均從事於大規模的修理或建築。</p>
<p>九一八以後，新設工廠有一百二十六所，投資總額爲一萬萬八千八百萬元。</p>
<p>至於兵工廠，航空公司，化學公司，煤鑛，鐵鑛，羊毛業，棉業，郵政局，電報局，一切與軍事有關的用品及交通運輸，無不在那裏極力擴充，攺進，日求發展。</p>

<h3 id="c252">中文鉛字字體談（上） <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 張枕錄</p>
<p>小小一枚鉛字，他負着顯示意思，傳佈文化的使命，同時把握了這些重大的功能和命運。原來他是常常被踐踏在排字工人們的脚底下，而又值得全民加以十分重視，給與十分好感的！</p>
<p>至少在七八十年前（？）的時候，耶穌敎會的西人，爲了印那宣傳敎義的中文書籍等件的需要，纔研究製成活版應用的中文鉛字，代替了那種拙劣不靈，久成不變的，我國老法遺傳下來水刷印工應用的活版木字。我們這個堂堂文化先進古國，所有推進文化的主要武器，今天居然得到這樣的成績，是靠我們耶穌基督的功勞，亞們！</p>
<p>製造鉛字最自然的條件，是在使人容易認識。那麽，那些蝌蚪文，鐘鼎文，篆書，隷書等字體，是祇足以供専家考據和研究之用，不合普通羣衆實際的使用了。在那個時期，所有官文書，公示文字，及其他，其間一應含有永久性質的文字，那書法都是習用着（洪武體），常常可以見到的，如職官的銜牌，燈寵，告示，私人的地界勒石，貢桌上的神主牌，棺材和頭的題註，等等，有許多處所，至今還沿用不廢。那洪武體的字形是扁的，組織的大槪是豎粗劃細，羅四維清疏，不致律劃混淆；所以這種字體就被採製鑄鉛字，祇就工作的需要上攺成了方形。後來大衆習慣了這種鉛印的字，索性把這印出來的字體稱爲（鉛字體）了。</p>
<p>有了粗的，簡單的，便要進到精的，繁雜的地位，這原是人類進化史的必然歷程。你看，東西洋各國用鉛字印出的他們本國的文字，都有很多種不同樣的字體，還有很悅目的美術體，所謂花體，何等熱閙！而我國自有鉛字以後幾十年間，老是使用着一種洪武體的鉛字，很像抱定（天不變，鉛字的體類也不變）這宗旨的一般。好的，我們旣有鉛字可以應用，又没有什麽不便之處，就算了罷，其他重要問題需用精神處正多着咧。這樣工藝上的競爭是總不會發生了；這也是美德，呌做（和平）。</p>
<p>可是，和平的陣綫總是不免要被突破的。大家在家幾十年間，老是看到這種單調的洪武體鉛字的印刷物，豈有不（久則生厭）？於是在二十年前有泉唐丁氏創製所謂、聚珍仿宋體）的鉛字，以應時勢的需要。洪武體的鉛字於是被分别而又稱爲（老宋體），大約也因洪武體是始於宋代之故。那仿宋體有長形和方形二種，他那細秀的筆致，均匀的法則，使人見了無不愛其清雅，生出快感可惜那製有該體鉛字的主人，在前時祇託中華書局一家，代理承印事務，目爲限制，難以普及。聽說，現在他家也廣招别家代理了。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>（九一八）紀念，於今是第三次了。我們每逢到這天，禁不住發生許多悲痛辛酸，認爲在民族史上是一個最大的恥辱。（不將四省先收復，奇恥重重洗不清）。有人憤憤的說：（一次紀念壮次紀念，三次紀念，通通是幻想，我們三年中在幻想中過生活，所得的敎訓，己經够受了，我們唯一的出路，惟有以眼報眼，以齒對齒，以大砲抗大砲，以轟炸機禦轟炸機，我們相信以武裝自衛，才可維持民族生存）。這話未嘗没有理由，可是我們以經濟的眼光來觀察，認爲我們唯一的出路，是一紙一針，不用外貨，一盆一碗，不待外求，口裏吃的，自上穿的，一絲一毫，不讓外人和仇人來賺我錢去。我們相信以經濟自衛，以國貨救國，自給自足，才可以維持民族永遠的生存。我們在這慘痛的（九一八）紀念來舉行九廠國貨商塲，來出版這國貨商塲特刋，便是要全市民衆全國同胞永永不忘這慘痛的（九一八）。永遠不忘提倡國貨，是人人應有的職責。惟有提倡國貨，可以制敵的死命，惟有服用國貨，可以維持中華民族的生存。我們試思自從（九一八）以至（一二八）兩次的慘劇，我們的市塲，被敵人摧毁多少？我們的銷路，被敵人阻碍多少？我們的生命綫，被敵人蹂躪多少？所以我們國貨界中人，對於（九一八）的紀念，個個痛心，個個切齒，一年一度，没齒不忘。</p>
<p>九廠國貨臨時商塲，發生於二十一年一次的（九一八）紀念提倡最熱烈的，是國貨界領袖方液仙，蔡聲白，任士剛，方劍閣，陳吉鄕，謝冰如諸君，當時加入的工廠，是中國化學工業社，美亞織綢廠，五和織造廠，中華琺瑯廠，中華第一針織廠，華福製帽廠，三友實業社，勝德織造廠，一心牙刷廠。（現三友社退出，攺爲鴻新染織廠，勝德廠退出，攺爲亞光電木廠）商塲的地址在南京路上綺華公司原址，（卽今上海國貨公司）籌備好久，霹靂一聲，南京路上唯一的國貨商塲，突然出現，人人於悲痛憤恨之餘，對此可愛可慰的國貨，有說不出的快慰和愛慕。所以營業的紀錄，眞是出乎預料之外。商塲職員的忙碌，幾至休息吃飯的時間都没有，有時連經理先生也要親自出馬。此中盛况，爲自來國貨商塲所未有，有人還以臨時爲可惜。因此便打動許多國貨界領袖的興趣，和設立國貨公司的决心。造端雖微，影響眞大。現在南京路上中國國貨公司和上海國貨公司的交相輝映，營業的盛况，可以凌駕三公司，飲水思源，不能不歸功於九廠國貨臨時商塲。二十二年的九一八紀念，適值國貨年頭，九廠領袖，賡續前功，在静安寺聖喬其舞塲原址開幕，哄動滬西，與浴佛節之盛會，後先輝映，都說第三次紀念，應在中區舉行。今年恰值婦女國貨年得中國國貨公司方液仙李康年二君之贊同，卽在南京路中心中國國貨公司舉行，非同業合作之到底不懈如此，而同業合作之發軔（指化妝品同業展覽會）又如彼，國貨前途之希望，眞無限量。聽說九廠當局和職工，在一年中經過不少的努力，許多出品，在質和量方面，都有顯著的進步，都可和舶來品媲美。而中國國貨公司，又能集諸廠之大成，得社會之信仰，試入其中，所見光顧的顧客，都是受過高深敎育的士女，和熱烈愛國的民衆，都是咬定牙關，誓不再用仇貨，趁這（九一八）紀念日中，舊地重游，益深敵愾同仇之感，這種意義，是何等的深遠，何等的富有價值。</p>
<h3 id="c254">由（九一八）想到了甘地 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 康屯</p>
<p>當（九一八）的大砲震破了我們錦繡河山的一角的時候，我這抱着亡國的殷憂的未亡人恰巧旅居在印度，和我們同樣可憐的（弱大的）印度。那時的我自然講不到執干戈以衛社稷，只有對着東北風而髮指而己。</p>
<p>（用什麽方法來救國呢？）（用什麽武器來禦寇呢？）直到現在，我還是和我們的大衆兄弟們一樣没有解答這一個天天掛在口頭的切膚問題。</p>
<p>那时，恰巧印度聖人甘地先生預備着到英國去出席英印圓桌會議。在孟買的民衆露天大會塲中，我居然從萬人叢中望見了那個赤膊跣足的民族救星。那時有人問起甘地先生代表印度民衆到大英國去，穿什麽服裝呢？他的答案是：</p>
<p>（我要恰像一個代表身份，不增一分，也不减一分。我當然不能裝成一個英國人的樣子來取悅於人。我是印度國民黨的代表，國民黨是印度餓得半死，凍得寒鷄瑟縮的民衆的代表，所以我也不願裝着印度貴紳們的光鮮服飾來自己遮掩。我這塊差堪蔽體的籠布是我最適當的服裝，如果倫敦的氣候容許我這樣，我便不必在這籠布之外加添什麽了。）</p>
<p>後來他果然買了英國郵船的二等艙位，携了手織具和在獄中用的盤皿數件從孟買出發。隨身還帶着土製的毛織短衫，頭巾，和自製的革履，土産的羊乳，乾棗，乾葡萄等件，赤着足到了倫敦，受着盛大的歡迎與禮遇。</p>
<p>印度獨立的成功與否，甘地革命的效果如何，此地不必深論。單單他的服用國貨，屏除洋化的以身作則，却是同樣處在被壓迫地位的經濟落後的民族所應取法的。</p>
<p>（九一八）的紀念又到了，（我們用什麽方法來雪恥呢？）（我們用什麽儀式來紀念呢？）我們的大砲不如人；我們的飛機不如人；我們的機器不如人；我們的工商業更不如人。我們的糼稚的生産依然落伍，我們奢侈的消費却如日高升。東北義勇戰士的血還殷紅在白山黑水之間！</p>
<p>至少，我們全民族，上中下各級民衆，老幼男女，應該一律服用國貨來代替披麻帶孝，作爲長期的（心喪）！</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>（九一八）三個字，照字面來說，不過是三個不同的數字組合而成的，然而一加研究，却又不然。這實在是個不良的名詞。回想到民國二十年九月十八日那天瀋陽的事，使人增加了無限的創痛，要知道中國，纔會有這個（九一八），也就是中國人，纔配接受着這個（九一八）。</p>
<p>（九一八）之來旣如是之速，你要磨滅這個（九一八），我知道是難上加難呢！一個人新做了一件衣裳，倘然給旁的人弄了一個汅蹟，一定要感受到非常的不快，同時對於那人，也覺得憎厭，這是人之常情！現在好好地中國版圓之上平空給旁人弄了一個大大的污點，極有關係的我們，却比了自己衣裳給人弄了污點來得爽氣，些激也不管賬，這個究竟是什麽道理？要知道衣裳，不過是一個人的衣裳；國家是大衆的國家，由這一點看來，我們（私心自利）的弱點，可以說暴露無遺了。惟其一人（私心自利）不要緊，十人百人（私心自利）也不要緊，於是　　性的全是，私心自利）了。雖能有一般深明事故的人，爲了私心自利從事的人太多，實在覺得太悲觀，同時也有奮臂狂呼的人，不管虎狼當前，也要一往直前的衝將過去，這就是（九一八）的雪恥者了。</p>
<p>（九一八）的造成，我以爲不應當怪人家的利害，人家早早的遞到了信息，可是喜睡的我們，總是不醒，試看幾次的侵略，所加到我們身上的是什麽，記得民國四年那時候，我們聰明的先生們，創造過（提倡國貨）丨丨我根本反對國貨之上，加（提倡）二字，應加（服用）二字，纔不錯，因爲（提倡）二字很空泛，丨丨到現在二十年的悠久時間之中，國貨究竟提倡了没有，如果我們果有决心，從民國四年起，一槪服用所需，不用舶來品。同時各物，都由有資産者，合作經營工廠，専事生産，這麽二十年，他的成績，我想不會在蘇俄的五年計劃之下呢！這都是我們一般人先天不足，生性善忘之故。那麽（九一八）之來，不是無因的了！幾次的大患，幾次的刺激，雖然犧牲了無辜的靑年，憑諸實際，一些也没有裨益呢！（九一八）當然成爲過去，到現在己是三個同年，可是不幸的消息，也會接二連三的來臨，現在市上充斥了低劣的物品，小販，商號，都樂於銷售，而購買者，祇要是便宜，無有不歡迎的。據說進口之多。較去年同月，要增加不少，這無疑地我國的金錢，照值的流出口去。</p>
<p>（九一八）之造成，原來我們行的奠基禮，人家來行落成禮罷了。大大的原因，是我們不能實行（服用國貨），有以致之。要知道人家能以侵略的手段加諸於人者，是非常的有步驟，有組織，不是貿貿然而行的。人家的心想是何等的缜密：人家的計劃，是如何的周到。我們是犯了心直口快的大毛病，說出，就算是做過，這樣，難怪要貽笑大方呢！</p>
<p>反過來說，我們都是實行（服用國貨）者，國貨如果對於某項出品，尚付闕如，我寗可不用，不吃，這樣的堅决，這樣的毅力，人家進口的貨品，因爲無人過問而原物運回去，這不是一件大快事嗎？</p>
<p>我們要磨滅（九一八）這三個可恥的字嗎？唯一的方法，是：（實行服用國貨）。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今天是什麽日子？今天是我們全體同胞非常悲痛和恥辱的一天。唉！今天原來是（九一八）國難的三週紀念呀！</p>
<p>唉！（九一八）的國難，說起來是如何的痛心啊！凡屬的血性的中國人，我想恐怕没有一個人不會非常憤慨的吧？但是，光是憤慨，到底有什麽用呢？失地仍然是没有收回，東三省的同胞，仍然是過着鐵蹄之下的亡省奴的生活，傀儡的組織，依然是没有取消，一念瘃此，能不使有心人悲從中來嗎？</p>
<p>（救國），（救國），這是全國上下一致的呼聲，然而空喊，空呌，究竟有多少效果？救國之道，非在高談闊論，貴能切實奉行！但是，究竟那一種方案，比較於國家，於民族，有些有處，在救國方面，有些實效，這恐怕似乎還成爲一個問題吧？</p>
<p>依我看來，救國之道，舍切切實實的提倡國貨以外，恐怕没有别的良好法兒了，雖然，救國是一件多方面的事，須各方面共同努力的，可是，此較起來，提倡國貨，還是佔一個非常重要的地位。</p>
<p>所以，當此（九一八）國難三週紀念之日，作者謹以至誠，奉告一般消費者，自今而後，要抱一個非國貨不買的念頭，奉勸一般商人，自今而後，也要抱一個非國貨不賣的决心，同時，更要奉勸一般國貨工廠，在生産方面，須力求貨品的精良，成本的减輕，出品的迅速，能如此消費者，推銷者，生産者，三方面的人，站在一條戰線上，來共同努力，共同奮鬥，那末，中國的國貨運動，才有成功的一天，同時，國難的程度，才有减少的希望，這是作者在（九一八）國難三週紀念，和九廠臨時特刋刋行的當兒，所懇切祈禱的。</p>

<p>好闊大的一個曠塲，不過地上，雜有不少細碎的石屑，原來這一個大曠塲，從前是専門拿來當作刑塲的，記得有一次在那裏斬過十三個殺人不眨眼的强盜，其中有兩個，眞是大好的漢子，一個連斬了十五刀，非但那頭頸上一些也没有痕跡，却連那劊子手都换上了六個，殺人的大刀，也捲口了六把，一個連斬了十一刀，都斬他們不下，那强盜面現笑容，非堂得意，後來劊子手向他打了誠懇的招呼，總算把那兩個强盜連撕帶劈的斬下來，這還是在清朝年間一件驚人的事件，後來民國，也連任的做了槍斃罪犯的所在，一般人看了那一個大曠塲，是一個不祥之地，所以没有誰肯來收拾這些殘磗剩瓦，不料這一天，也不知爲了什麽，平白地擠滿了許多人，男的女的，老的小的，不知的多少，那時我的表上，正是一分也不缺的是下午三時正，我爲了好奇，用力向人叢中擠進去看個究竟。</p>
<p>用了生平的力氣，總算給我擠出了最前的一圈，那裏知道不看猶可，一看却惹起了我的驚疑和震駭，原來中間的一個，不是别人，正是那有志靑年王子榮啊！祇見那王子榮，漲紅了臉孔，喊破了喉嚨的在那裏演說：（未完）</p>

<p>中國化學工業社</p>
<p>九廠商塲之命名，早爲各界所洞知矣。其動機爲紀念九一八事件，於民廿一年由九大國貨廠商聯合組織，實具有臥薪嘗膽益自奮勉之意，並爲國人之晨鐘暮鼓，常念恥辱猶未湔雪，加以激刺與憬醒也。本年己屬第三屆舉行，恥辱宛舊，而復變本加厲焉！國人對之，將作何感想？</p>
<p>中國化學工業社，亦爲九廠商塲發起主幹之一，贊助敦促，尤致力焉。揆諸該社二十三年來努力於提倡國貨，振興工商爲主旨，其慘澹經營，克臻今日之地位，得與舶來品爭一日之短長，當非一蹴而幾，其堅毅之精神，實足爲吾人所敬佩以爲表率者也。</p>
<p>再按該社出品，可大别爲牙膏，化妝品，調味品，蚊香藥品諸類，無一不爲首先研究製造，是故市塲中人，對於三星牌出品，皆讚美之爲（三星老牌），如三星牙膏之風行，白玉膏之精良，皆爲社會人士所樂道者，聞該社本年對於化妝品中又有新貢獻，如時代霜，天香霜，軟香玉牡丹香皂等皆爲化妝紗品，品質未必較遜舶來品，而定價則較舶來爲廉遠甚，調味品中觀音粉，味生，美味素等，且暢銷美國南洋各地。至三星蚊香，則暢銷國内外允推獨步。而該社採辦原料物材，亦均儘量取用國貨，其苦心孤詣，尤爲一般國貨廠商所應效法者矣。</p>
<p>不忘九一八而惟及九廠商塲，更由九廠商塲而連類及此主幹之一之中國化學工業社，豈獨對該社讚歎而己哉！救國雪恥，原不欲九一八恥辱之存在，深望九廠商塲從第三屆而永久終止，吾於參加九廠商塲之各國貨工廠當馨香以謝之。</p>
<p>美亞織綢廠</p>
<p>中國絲綢，向來著聞於全世界，但年來則以蠶絲品質，日益窳劣，致産銷量逐漸低落。自九一八事件發生後，生絲，出口之數量，更形銳减，而國内之銷費量，亦復奇小，絲廠綢廠之倒閉者，前後相望，農民鋤桑毁種，仰屋興嗟，其爲全國經濟之重大打擊者，夫人皆知，而爲民生之當前一大問題，應如何可以解决，則非三言兩語，可得而言。</p>
<p>現在國内之綢疋售價，己低落至與布疋相仿，而從事綢業者，猶不能收産銷相等比例之效，非虧本，卽倒閉，無日無時無地，莫不引頸盼人救濟。蓋全國之産絲量，消費者不過五分之一，其餘均以洋莊不動，而滯積於國内，致農村經濟，日益破産，人民購買力益薄弱，綢疋更無人過問也。</p>
<p>向來綢疋之消費者，東四省方面，亦佔一大部份，自九一八以來，此消費量，己爲日貨所奪，致使我絲綢行銷之範圍，日益缩小。欲救濟因絲綢衰落而破産之農村，則除盡力採用國産絲綢，實無第二途徑。今綢價己與布價相仿，則採用綢緞，己不能謂其奢侈，復何樂而不用哉？</p>
<p>美亞織綢廠，在絲業風雨飄搖之秋，以其人才與資本之集中，故秉其毅力，獨能撑持，且努力猛晋不己，卒爲全國絲織業之首擘，所有出品，不特物美價廉，抑且種類繁多，頃亦爲紀念九一八起見，特以大批出品，加入九一八臨時國貨商塲，發售，其目的在求國人之普遍採用，以救農村，並所以紀念九一八與國産絲綢之關係，深自惕勵！</p>
<p>五和織造廠</p>
<p>是廠爲内衣棉織業之巨擘，専産鵝牌内衣，所有出品，質地堅緻，價格低廉，合於經濟美觀耐用三原則，社會人土，一致稱贊，有口皆碑也，茲將各種出品，介紹於愛用國貨之士女。</p>
<p>是廠除織製汗衫，汗背心，衛生衫褲，護和衫，春秋衫褲，及各種羢布外，於去年新出蔴紗汗衫一種，潔折凉爽，經穿耐洗，而售價低廉，故較舶來品實有過之無及。因是識與不識，均以購用鵝牌出品爲榮。本年是廠又最先織製軟羢棉毛衫一種，此衫式樣新頴，服之柔軟適體，針脚之細密，身骨之優美，堪稱内衣中之上乘，與春秋衫護和衫均爲目下秋凉時適宜之服禦品。是以問世以來，頗受男女新靑年所歡迎，但廠中領袖，猶不自足，對原料紗綫，嚴加精選，工程製造，力求攺進，務使出品之精益求精。對於紗綫，本國紗廠如有出品，靡不極力設法，以符（完全國貨）之實際，另一方面，竭力求成本在舶來之下，抵制列强之經濟侵略，同時復使出品行銷普遍，使吾國人均知國貨廠家，亦能織製精美之内衣也。</p>
<p>中華琺瑯廠</p>
<p>市上自立鶴牌各種搪瓷哭皿風行後，舶來品之搪瓷出品，頗形滯銷，於是同業中之聞風而起者，有如雨後春筍，然不久卽告消沉，緣繼起者初無固定之宗旨，與縝密之方法，以致出品，形質均較低劣，於是存貨堆積而不能銷行。</p>
<p>立鶴牌爲中華琺瑯廠之商標，取義誠清高之至，蓋鶴立鷄羣，的非凡品。</p>
<p>立鶴牌最著名之出品如仿歐式之各種盥漱用具，衛生器具等，均爲國貨搪瓷界不可多得之傑作，其最爲人所稱道者，厥惟鐵盒火油爐·所具優點，爲舶來品所不及，其裝置之鐵盒，旣便携帶，復利旅行，能得各界之歡迎，良有以也。</p>
<p>中華第一針織廠</p>
<p>本廠成立於民六年間。最初創辦人係謝子楠先生，總廠設楊樹浦龍江路，辦事處設在四川路泰安坊内。起初以小資本經營，内部所用機械，完全採用最新式美國電力機，但電力機只二十四架，每日織襪二百五十打。而那時絲光染色等，須賴分廠之助。後經歷年擴充和努力，除織襪部力事擴大外，舉凡染色部，絲光部，製盒部，整理部，均先後添辦，並向歐美各國購置機器，乃得不賴他廠，故其出品愈益精美，有今日之成效。目前每日出品有三千打之多，其銷路百分之八十銷於國内，百分之二十銷售南洋及國外。最著名之出品爲團龍牌絲襪，　龍牌眞蔴紗襪，孔雀牌人造絲襪，菊花牌絲光綫襪，此外延壽牌，鐵砲牌襪，亦能盛行一時。營業額最初全年不過十萬元，嗣後逐漸增加至二百萬元左右。九一八之後，東北市塲，完全喪失，一二八之役，商業衰落，農村破産，各地購買力更不如前，營業額亦隨之下降。該廠　局念數百工友生計可慮，竭力支持，並力闢新市塲，上下一體，勉力奮鬭，故雖在風雨飄搖之中，而仍能安然支撑，今年之營業額，因之較有起色。預計一二年後，或能恢復九一八以前之狀况。貨價一再减低，以求迎合購買者之心理，而出品務求精美，以保全原有之信譽。聞該廠擬於可能時期中將各種針織品逐步發展，以完成針織廠之初衷，而達中華第一之希望焉。故來日之事業，雖半由於辦理者之努力，亦由半賴愛國同胞之提携，本廠前途，庶有豸乎？</p>
<p>華福製帽廠</p>
<p>華福製帽有限公司，創始於民國七年，設廠河間路五十號，全廠面積凡四萬五千方尺，該廠爲謀根本解决，採辦純質羊毛，用最新電機，自織自染，製造呢帽胚子，不復假手外人，以圖自立，出品爲鷹艇雙球商標，每年呢帽草帽出品逹四十餘萬項，式樣精美，價格低廉，堪與舶來相頡頑，邇來愛國同胞，羣相購戴，而一般外僑，亦因物美價廉，互爲贊揚，實國貨呢帽界之一頁光榮史也。</p>
<p>鴻新染織廠</p>
<p>鴻新染織廠，成立於十餘年前，在染織業方面，亦可謂有悠久之歷史，該廠出品，槪以紅星爲商標，用意至善，蓋藉紅星之大光，普照於全國，亦卽紅星大光到處，鴻新布亦隨之。</p>
<p>鴻新布唯一特點，爲（永不退色）與（花樣新頴），故深得各界人士之信仰，而一致購用，舉凡老幼男女，無不咸宜，誠以該廠主事者，富有經騐，若何之質料，宜於老人；若何之質料，宜於童子；若何之質料，宜於老婦；若何之質料，宜於少女，夫如是，其出品始能博得大衆之歡迎與信仰，該廠現有電力織機三百餘架·工人五百餘名，每日出品，有四百疋之多，全國各大商埠，莫不有鴻新永不退色布之踪跡。</p>
<p>該廠最大之特約經銷處，爲上海南京路大陸商塲中國國貨公司布疋部，外埠向該公司函購鴻新永不退色布者，日必有數十起云。</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Painful Discourse on the Third Anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang fell, and only three years have passed, yet the painful impression of the September 18th Incident in the minds of most Chinese people within the borders seems to have faded like a historical relic! If today were not September 18th, how many of the four hundred million descendants of the Yellow Emperor would still remember the great shame and humiliation of three years ago? If the majority of Chinese people usually view the September 18th Incident as nothing more than a historical relic, then even participating in the annual commemorative ceremony is just a way to comfort themselves and an embellishment. If sticking a few posters and shouting a few slogans in a memorial hall could accomplish the great task of washing away the shame and avenging the hatred, then sticking posters and shouting slogans would have been something we were good at in the past, and the great Northeast would not have suffered the lament of being submerged. Why would we need this commemorative gesture?</p>
<p>At today's memorial services held in various places, I know there will be those who speak passionately and those who weep bitterly. At that moment, everyone's true feelings are revealed, wishing they could fight the enemy to the death. Even the timid become brave, and the cowardly become resolute! However, as time passes, pleasure-seekers remain the same, revelers remain the same, and those who are indifferent remain the same. Fortunately, it has not been long since the tragedy of the lost provinces, and the wounds inflicted by the enemy are still fresh, so there is still the so-called commemorative ceremony to vent temporary grief and indignation and express a slight sense of animosity towards the enemy. If, over time, the wounds gradually fade, the grief and indignation gradually subside, and the animosity towards the enemy gradually diminishes, it will be difficult to even seek a formal commemoration. Observing the past and examining the future, this situation and this circumstance will inevitably occur. How can we not be saddened!</p>
<p>Today, I dare to suggest to the Chinese people: If we can truly understand the real meaning of commemorating the September 18th Incident, we will surely pay attention to the continuity of the September 18th Incident, viewing every moment from now on as a concrete and microcosmic September 18th Incident and think about how to first avenge the shame. Only then can we firmly recognize the goal we should pursue, ponder deeply, exhaust our wisdom and energy, and prepare for a life-and-death battle with our common enemy, Japan! Once this determination is made, we can temporarily ignore how much our strength can ultimately defeat the enemy. Let us first examine ourselves: How much of our preparatory work has been completed? How much remains unfinished?</p>
<p>My patriotic compatriots should know that military strategy says: "Place yourselves in a position of desperation, and you will survive." If you truly want to accomplish an extraordinary task in an extraordinary time, then the most difficult path is the most straightforward path. Otherwise, if you only know how to take winding detours and follow the path of least resistance, the temporary obstacles may be small, but the dangers that arise will be great. If we are determined to avoid difficulties and seek ease, leading ourselves to destruction, then so be it. Otherwise, actively resisting the enemy should be the primary principle for establishing the nation from now on! And the way to promote and implement this must rely on the development of the national spirit and the strength of a national organization! Do you not see that our Northeast volunteer armies, who have repeatedly fallen and risen, still know how to fight bloody battles and persevere in their struggle, even under the oppression of a strong enemy? Mr. Guo Taiqi, our country's representative to the League of Nations, recently listed the recent battle achievements of the volunteer armies, announcing them to the world. All who heard it were moved, knowing that the warm blood of our compatriots outside the border still remains and that the hearts of the people are not dead. They all expressed their admiration. How can we bear to ignore those brave men who have placed themselves in the forefront to sacrifice for the country without thinking of lending a helping hand? Do you not also see that our economic boycott movement, which is raging like a fire, has repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the enemy? Knowledgeable people believe that its effectiveness may even surpass guns and cannons. In this autumn of national crisis, how can we not continue to advocate it to fulfill our national duty? All of these things cannot be accomplished by the efforts of one person or a few people in a short period of time. The true value of the so-called national spirit and national organization is thus revealed!</p>
<p>Alas! The autumn wind is bleak, the fallen leaves are scattered, and the nation is in peril. I want to cry but have no tears! Today, what I can tell the people of the country is only this: "Compromising to seek complete safety will ultimately lead to death; active resistance is the path to survival!" I deeply hope that the people of the country will keep this in mind and not make another mistake!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Alas, the Northeast Today! The World <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese seized our Northeast, they have immediately started to manufacture the puppet state of "Manchukuo." At the same time, they have implemented a Japan-(Manchukuo) controlled economy, sucking the marrow and blood of our Northeast compatriots, driving our Northeast compatriots like cattle and horses, while they themselves occupy the position of supreme emperor, enjoying themselves and reaping the benefits. Our compatriots in the four provinces are crawling under the harsh rule of Japan-(Manchukuo), unable to survive, unable to find death. They are in deep water and hot fire. Fortunately, their patriotic hearts are accumulating day by day, and the underground resistance movement is continuing its efforts without weakening. However, the Japanese have been wantonly destroying them, sparing no effort. Our volunteer armies, who are struggling in hardship and difficulty, are in danger of running out of food and being cut off from aid. This is truly lamentable! On this third anniversary of the September 18th Incident, as we recall the past, our hearts are filled with grief and indignation. We truly have the feeling of wanting to cry without tears, unable to bear to look back. Therefore, I will summarize and state the current situation in the Northeast to inform the people of the country. The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual. We should learn from the past and be self-reliant! Although Chu has only three households, it will surely destroy Qin. I hope that our four hundred million descendants of the Yellow Emperor will share this understanding, deal with the enemy, and dare to believe that our bright and shining flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun will eventually fly again between the Black Mountains and White Waters.</p>
<p>1.  Politics: All important positions in the puppet government are occupied by the Japanese. The general traitors are all puppets who eat their salaries. The Japanese hold great power and can ask for anything they want. In the administrative organs of the puppet government, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications are especially densely populated by the Japanese. This is because the two ministries are the central hub for manipulating the economy of the puppet state, and they are not comparable to ordinary departments. From this, we can see the painstaking efforts of the Japanese. In addition, although the provincial governors of each province are traitors, they are actually just holding their positions and doing nothing, only following the lead of the Japanese. In the local county governments and other offices, the so-called counselors and subordinates are also filled by the Japanese, and their power far exceeds that of the county magistrates.</p>
<p>Puyi, who went from being the puppet administrator to shamelessly ascending the throne, should have been complacent. However, since ascending the throne, he does not even have the power to stamp seals. Big or small, all matters are controlled by Hishikari, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army. Puyi swallows his tears and regrets it, but it is too late.</p>
<p>2.  Economy: The currency system in the Northeast was originally extremely chaotic, but the economic foundation was still relatively stable, and the people were not panicked. After the incident, the Japanese formulated a unified currency system for the puppet state and decided to abolish all kinds of paper money previously used in the Northeast by the end of June this year. However, because the general public does not trust the currency of the puppet state and because the initial issuance of the puppet currency was excessive, coupled with the tendency to stop redemption, many people are unwilling to store it casually for fear of following the same disastrous path as the Russian Kerensky notes. The puppet government, recognizing that the factual obstacles were difficult to overcome, decided to postpone the order to abolish the old currency for one year. Furthermore, in terms of taxes, from the beginning of the puppet organization, it had once proclaimed the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes to reduce the burden on the people, but in reality, it has been wantonly levying and extorting taxes in every possible way. In addition, with the disturbances of bandits and the disasters of floods, the rural economy has been completely bankrupted. Last year's harvest was still abundant, and the farmers thought they could barely make ends meet, but unexpectedly, the Japanese manipulated the economy of the entire region, implemented a blockade, banned the export of grain, and imposed heavy taxes on soybeans shipped to Japan. The calculation is so vicious that nothing can be added! Not only that, but the changes in the countries involved in foreign trade in the Northeast have also undergone significant changes compared to before. According to the statistics released by the puppet government, both exports and imports from mainland China have declined sharply, while the proportion of those from Japan has increased significantly. In other words, Japanese goods have gradually driven the goods produced in our mainland China out of the Northeast market in order to realize its controlled economy plan.</p>
<p>3.  Opium Disaster: The people of the Northeast have always regarded land and grain as the foundation of their economic activities. Now, the price of grain has fallen sharply, and there are still many who have goods but cannot sell them. Therefore, in people's transactions, opium is often used as a substitute for currency. The number of opium addicts in the Northeast has increased by 70% compared to before. Moreover, in order to increase revenue, the puppet state has openly designated areas for planting opium as places for collecting opium tax. However, the dense forests and mountains of Jilin, which are considered difficult to maintain security, are prohibited from planting. The puppet law stipulates that those who sell more than one tael of opium will be sentenced to six months or two to three years of imprisonment. Those who sell ten or one hundred taels, on the other hand, may be innocent. In addition, the number of narcotics such as red pills, golden pills, heroin, and white powder that flood the Northeast is even greater! This policy of expanding the application of poison is nothing more than a means of weakening the morale of our Northeast people and destroying the physique of our Northeast people.</p>
<p>What is somewhat gratifying is that the volunteer armies of the Northeast have risen and fallen, fighting tirelessly. In recent months, Deng Tiemei's troops have fought in western Liaoning, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese puppets. Liu Liangshan's troops are active on the border between Liaoning and Rehe, Zhao Yushan and others have attacked Bin County, Huang Xishan (Old North Wind) has risen in Benxi, and Qi Zhanjiu's troops are guarding Changshanyu. All of these actions are well-known and praised by our people. The Northeast is now in the season of green crops, and the volunteer armies are taking advantage of the opportunity to operate, and their momentum is even greater than before. The popular uprisings triggered by the Japanese puppets confiscating civilian guns and seizing civilian land have also provided strong support for the volunteer army movement. The Japanese puppets fear that the situation will become a prairie fire that cannot be stopped, and they have always regarded it as a major problem and have repeatedly tried to eliminate it. The puppet Ministry of Military Affairs has recently delineated the areas for suppressing the (bandits) army in order to completely eliminate them. Although our volunteer armies are not afraid of this, they also feel isolated and weak due to the difficulty of receiving supplies. Therefore, providing substantial assistance is our responsibility. I hope that our compatriots within the borders will quickly take action!</p>
<h3 id="e3">The World Situation and the Far Eastern Question, by Ziheng <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Since the end of the last world war, the nations of the world, fearing the dangers of war, have all made a resolute effort to change their ways and strive for international peace. Therefore, all plans that can contribute to peace are being implemented to the best of their ability. Thus, first there was the organization of the League of Nations, then the establishment of the Washington treaties, followed by the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and finally the establishment of the London Naval Treaty. For more than a decade, the atmosphere of peace has been fluctuating and lingering. At this point, dawn has reappeared. Such a phenomenon has never been seen before in historical records. If we can follow this path and persevere to the end, then even if we cannot say that international war can be eradicated from now on, the fact that world peace will not be destroyed immediately is within the expectations of the world. Unexpectedly, the destruction of peace occurred the year after the end of the London Naval Conference, and the destroyer was Japan, which had signed these international treaties. Isn't this a strange thing?</p>
<p>However, there is also a reason why Japan dares to disregard everything and occupy our Northeast four provinces with violence. The most obvious reasons are about five: (1) The League of Nations itself lacks strength. The League of Nations originally had the sanctions of Article 16 against countries that violated the Covenant. However, in the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Northeast, the League of Nations only made an empty resolution to deny the puppet organization and never dared to impose the sanctions of Article 16 on Japan. This has been deeply criticized by the world. In fact, even if the League of Nations imposed the sanctions of Article 16 on Japan, its effect would only be equal to zero. This is because the implementation of the League of Nations' sanctions must be carried out by strong member states. Looking at the world today, the only countries capable of implementing this kind of sanctions are the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia. And the sanctions of these three countries must be carried out simultaneously and in coordination to be effective. However, when Japan invaded our three eastern provinces and occupied our Rehe with airplanes and artillery, both the United States and Russia were not members of the League of Nations. (The Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations is a recent event.) In this regard, the reason why the League of Nations could only deny the puppet organization and did not dare to rashly promise sanctions was precisely because it was acting according to its own strength. It is not too much to criticize. If it were not so, its credibility would be even more tarnished than it is today. (2) After the Washington Conference, neither the United Kingdom nor the United States, relying on the strength of one country, could restrain Japan. Although the United Kingdom and the United States each had a ratio of 5:5:3 in battleships, which was superior to Japan, the United States' suspension of the construction of ports in the Philippines meant that it was no longer enough to threaten Japan. At the same time, the United Kingdom, with its defense area too large and no good naval ports north of Singapore, was also not enough to worry Japan. The U.S. naval base in Hawaii is 4,000 nautical miles away from Japan, and the U.K.'s Singapore is 2,900 nautical miles away from Japan. Both distances are outside the effective range of combat. Unless the United Kingdom and the United States cooperate, Japan can win with ease. (3) The confrontation between Soviet Russia and the capitalist countries had not been eliminated around the time of the September 18th Incident. France, in Europe, was acting as the organizer of the anti-Russian united front. The United Kingdom was also very suspicious of Russia. The United States had not yet recognized Russia. Under these circumstances, Japan's direct occupation of the Northeast, under the pretext of defending against Russia's eastward advance, was enough to make the capitalist countries fall into a state of confusion and helplessness. (4) The disputes in Europe, with France and Germany as the core, became increasingly serious. The United Kingdom was constrained by them, making it even more unable to pay attention to matters in the Far East. (5) The United Kingdom and the United States could not coordinate and could not impose sanctions on Japan. These five reasons allowed Japan to be dismissive of everything and do whatever it wanted. Therefore, looking back on the past, the blame for Japan's daring to tear up international peace treaties and defy the world should not be borne solely by the League of Nations, nor should it be borne by any one country. It should be borne by the entire international situation at that time. However, in the past year, the world situation has shown signs of change. The points that can be mentioned are as follows.</p>
<p>(II) Soviet Russia's Accession to the League of Nations and the Far East</p>
<p>When Japan occupied our Northeast with violence, it claimed that if it promoted itself as defending against Russia and opposing communism, it would be able to gain international sympathy. However, it did not know that the speed of Soviet Russia's improvement in international relations was never as obvious as after Japan occupied our Northeast. For example, the extension of the non-aggression treaties between the Baltic countries and Russia, the recognition of Russia by the Little Entente countries, the beginning of Franco-Russian friendship last year, the U.S. recognition of Russia this spring, the recent cooperation between France and Russia, and even today's accession to the League of Nations all occurred after Japan occupied our Northeast. Although the reason for this, in addition to Japan, also includes Germany, which is capable of starting a European war, the main driving force is actually Japan. If Japan had no enmity with Russia, then Germany would not dare to vow to develop eastward. Therefore, the reason why European and American capitalist countries recognize the status of Soviet Russia and even want to encircle Germany with an East European Pact is obviously to eliminate the crisis of a two-pronged attack on Soviet Russia by Japan and Germany, to prevent the further expansion of Japan's invasion, and at the same time to leave a guarantee force for international peace. It is also to increase the power to sanction Japan in the future. Therefore, although the national systems of Soviet Russia and capitalist countries are different today, their interests are connected. The previous state of confrontation can be said to no longer exist. The production of this steady and strange phenomenon is due to Germany's attitude accounting for a small part, and Japan's actions since the September 18th Incident accounting for the majority. Therefore, the impact of this change in the international situation on the future of the Far East is not small.</p>
<p>(III) The Naval Disarmament Conference and the Far East</p>
<p>The formal Naval Disarmament Conference will be held next year, but the preparatory meeting has recently been held in London. Japan's main demands are: first, not to discuss Far Eastern political issues (i.e., the future of the puppet state, i.e., the issue of China's territorial sovereignty and land integrity); second, the issue of naval equality, or the adoption of the total tonnage method. However, judging from European and American telegrams, none of these demands of Japan have been met. The British Conservative Party even deeply regrets the signing of the Washington Treaty and is particularly dissatisfied with the London Naval Disarmament Treaty created by MacDonald. At the same time, it decided to expand its naval and air force plans. The British government also clearly denied the Japanese's one-sided propaganda that Britain had agreed not to raise political issues. As for the United States, it is focusing on air force equipment in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. At the same time, its former Admiral Pratt has written an article strongly advocating the necessity of discussing political issues. The general idea is that the establishment of the last Washington Naval Disarmament Treaty was originally conditional on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty. If the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty are torn up, then the Five-Power Naval Disarmament Treaty is meaningless. This is because President Harding convened the Washington Conference in 1922 precisely to clear the clouds of war over the Pacific. Unexpectedly, the situation in the Pacific today is a thousand times more dangerous than before. This is precisely the time for us to find a way to correct our past mistakes. How can we put political issues aside and not discuss them? Judging from these two points, the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the necessity of discussing political issues can be said to be consistent. However, Britain and the United States are still discussing issues such as naval ratios and warship sizes. The United Kingdom's desire to restore its status as the leading naval power seems to be very determined. Therefore, it is still impossible for Britain and the United States to fully coordinate. However, the international situation is constantly changing, and the future cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>(IV) The Question of Franco-Italian Alignment and the Far East</p>
<p>A few days ago, a European telegram came, saying that France and Italy also have the possibility of alignment. This news came from Rome, but Paris did not mention it. Not only did it not mention it, but Agence France-Presse also had a telegram denying it. The truth is still unknown. I think that the French and Italian authorities may have this intention because of their common opposition to Germany. However, they are afraid that the United Kingdom will object, so they deliberately released this news to explore the intentions of the United Kingdom. It is also possible that if the United Kingdom can agree, then Germany will become a turtle in a jar, and there will be no possibility of causing a war. Its indirect impact on the Far East goes without saying. However, the key focus is on the United Kingdom. Today, the French consider it a good strategy to strive to obtain British cooperation. They will not disregard the United Kingdom's intentions. Moreover, for France, gaining one Italy and losing one Britain is also harmful and not beneficial. If it is for the Far East, gaining one Italy and losing one Britain is even more detrimental to the overall international situation. Therefore, if the Franco-Italian alignment is approved by Britain, it will be enough to increase peace in the Far East. If not, it will only increase the disputes in the Far East. France is the center of the League of Nations today and has recently allied with Russia. It must consider the status of Soviet Russia in the Far East. If it is not completely secure, it will not align with Italy. Furthermore, France's arrangements against Germany seem to be more than sufficient. The relationship with Italy is good enough. Beyond this, there is really no need to do more.</p>
<p>(V) Pessimism and Optimism</p>
<p>Judging from the above points, although the future of the Far Eastern question still has its pessimistic points, there are also many points that can be considered optimistic. The most obvious point is that today, the only countries that are trying to expand their territory are Germany in Europe and Japan in the Far East. Apart from this, all countries in the world seem to have stopped their ambitions for territory. For example, today's United Kingdom has territories all over the world. Its territory is so large that it exceeds its defense capabilities. Therefore, its status is no different from that of a wealthy family, valuing its life and property. Unless absolutely necessary, it will not want to use a policy of aggression to seek further territorial expansion. If war breaks out again, the British Empire will inevitably face the danger of collapse. Therefore, its policy is to ensure international peace as the best strategy for self-preservation. As for the United States, it has already made a clear statement that it will abandon the Philippines. It will certainly not have any ambition to expand its overseas territory again. France also has many territories. Its greatest requirement in Europe is to maintain treaty benefits. Therefore, its position is also equivalent to a family that is protecting its inheritance. As for Soviet Russia, it has already abandoned its world revolution policy, signed non-aggression treaties with various countries, and now it has joined the League of Nations. Its desire not to invade the territory of others by illegal means is also roughly visible. Therefore, today, the only countries that cannot guarantee that they will have no ambition to expand their land are Japan in the Far East and Germany in Western Europe. But the countries that oppose this kind of attempt include the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Russia. Therefore, in terms of quantity, the forces of peace have already surpassed the forces of aggression. This can be considered one point for optimism. Furthermore, from the perspective of whether these countries can cooperate, not only can the United States not compromise with Japan, but there is also the possibility of military conflict in the future. Although the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States cannot be coordinated now, it is very obvious that they will not have military conflict. Therefore, comparing the relationship between Japan and the United States and the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, one knows that the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States is closer than the relationship between the United States and Japan, and the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States is deeper than the relationship between the United Kingdom and Japan. The reason why the United Kingdom abolished the Anglo-Japanese alliance at the request of the United States at the Washington Conference is this. Compared with the U.S.-Japan relationship today and the U.S.-Japan relationship in the past, the degree of deterioration is really incomparable. Since the United Kingdom resolutely abolished the Anglo-Japanese alliance in the past when the U.S.-Japan relationship was not extremely tense, it should carry out its original intention today when the U.S.-Japan relationship is already extremely tense. Therefore, the rumor that the Anglo-Japanese alliance will be revived is not worth refuting. Some people believe that if the Anglo-Japanese alliance is not revived, the United Kingdom's position in the Far East will be harmed by Japan. However, it is not known that if Japan takes this action, it will only promote the alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States and form Japan's suicide. With the cleverness of the Japanese, how can they not see this? Therefore, although the coordination between the United Kingdom and the United States is not easy to achieve, it can be concluded that the alliance between the United Kingdom and Japan is absolutely difficult to revive. Moreover, the United Kingdom has more than enough self-preservation, which is caused by the international situation. There is really no need to borrow from the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Therefore, in the future international changes, the possibility of coordination between the United Kingdom and the United States is above the possibility of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. This can be doubted. Some people also believe that the Conservative Party of England fears Russia like scorpions, so it is willing to restore the Anglo-Japanese alliance to oppose Russia. However, what the British fear is Russia's world revolution policy. Today's Russia has already abandoned its world revolution policy. Even the weak countries bordering Russia no longer fear Russia. Why say that the great Britain still fears Russia? Moreover, the Soviet Union has now joined the League of Nations, and the power of the United Kingdom is second only to France. Even the East European Pact, which guarantees the western border of the Soviet Union, has been approved by the United Kingdom. Isn't this what the Conservative Party government has done? In this regard, the theory that the Conservative Party fears Russia like a tiger has already lost its timeliness with the changes in the international situation. Therefore, to reiterate, not only is the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance impossible, but the cooperation between Britain and Russia has already revealed its beginnings. This can be considered a second point for optimism. Furthermore, the relationship between Britain and France has gradually returned to the old trend of cooperation before the war. Therefore, on the point that Britain must expand its air force, Baldwin does not speak of France, but of Britain's defense, which should be on the other side of the Rhine. The implication is self-evident. What the British fear today is Germany's rash actions. Once Germany acts, a war in the Far East will inevitably follow. Whether the United Kingdom participates or not, it will be harmful and not beneficial. Therefore, for the sake of the United Kingdom, if peace can be achieved, even if it means compromising Germany, it will not hesitate to do so. This is the reason why the British are directly trying to accommodate France. It is also the reason why it is indirectly beneficial to Soviet Russia. It is also the reason why there is still a possibility of cooperation between Britain and Russia. This can be considered a third point for optimism. Finally, the attitude of the United States towards the League of Nations is also gradually changing. If given time, it may even follow in Russia's footsteps and join the League of Nations. If this is the case, then the power of the League of Nations will be thicker, and the hope for peace will be greater.</p>
<p>However, if we want to solve the Northeast problem, there are only two methods: (1) In the League of Nations, the major powers sincerely cooperate and thus implement effective sanctions against Japan; (2) As advocated by the British Labor Party and the Liberal Party, seek the cooperation of the three powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia to impose sanctions on Japan. We believe that if one of these two methods can be implemented, it will be enough to subdue Japan. The world war can be avoided from then on, which is not impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Relationship Between Japan and the Soviet Union After the September 18th Incident <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>1.  The Situation of Conflict Between Japan and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the opposition between Japan and the Soviet Union intensified day by day. The crises that had been lurking everywhere in the past have gathered together as time goes by. Japanese militarists claim to maintain peace in the Far East, but in reality, they are threatening and even destroying peace. The most telling proof is the increase in Japan's military budget over the years. The army and navy budget for this year is estimated at 936 million Japanese yen. The budget for next year (1935) has not yet been determined. Although the Minister of Finance has strongly advocated for cuts to the estimate proposed by the military, we believe that the army and navy will not compromise on reductions. They also have to deal with the Naval Arms Reduction Conference and stabilize the four northeastern provinces. Therefore, the army and navy will insist on their demands. In any case, the military budget for next year will be larger than this year, probably accounting for more than 50% of the total annual expenditure.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union feels the greatest threat from such military expansion, and the situation is most serious in the northern Manchurian plains and eastern and western Siberia. Before the September 18th Incident, the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union was not direct, and the disputes over North Sea fisheries did not lead to major consequences. After Japan swept through northern Manchuria, a puppet state nominally took charge, but the actual responsibility lies with the Kwantung Army Commander, a three-in-one entity. Heavy troops are stationed along the Chinese Eastern Railway line, and steel and concrete fortresses are being built in the Greater Khingan Mountains. Can such military preparations be reduced in budget?</p>
<p>Japan's military strategy against the Soviet Union originally aimed for (victory without war). The first was to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway at the opportune moment. The second was to use economic offensives to cut the Chinese Eastern Railway into three sections, depriving it of its economic and political value and forcing the Soviet Union to abandon it. Regarding the first method of seizure, the excellent military strength and special political rights within the Northeast were used to direct the puppet state to come forward, which put all actions in an advantageous position. Regarding the second method, the strategy adopted by Japan was more far-reaching. They knew that the Chinese Eastern Railway was deeply rooted in northern Manchuria. If they did not find a way to occupy it, it would not only be a major military obstacle but also cause many unexpected political difficulties. Economically, it was even detrimental to the Japanese Empire. However, if they wanted to use the first policy, they could only act on the eve of war. Therefore, they decided to use the second method to reduce the economic value of the Chinese Eastern Railway so that the Soviet Union would have to retreat. The method they used was to make the Taonan Railway play a role in the western part of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and cooperate with the Siping-Taonan Railway to absorb agricultural products from Heilongjiang as much as possible. They also planned to complete the Er-zhan to Heihe Railway in the shortest possible time, so that the products of Heilongjiang and the Greater Khingan Mountains would be controlled by these two railways. Furthermore, regarding immigration, the focus was on Jiamusi, but now only automobile and summer and autumn water transportation are available, which is very inconvenient. The Mudanjiang to Jiamusi Railway has already started construction. After this railway is completed, the special products of the Songhua River basin will also be under Japanese control. At the same time, the Jihui Railway will also be completed soon. Qingjin and Rajin ports are not only the transit ports for the Jihui Railway but also important strongholds on the Japanese sea. The railway in the Northeast is almost parallel to the Chinese Eastern Railway and has the deep intention of blockading Vladivostok at sea.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union finds it difficult to resolve such political and military threats by force. Economically, it is also in a passive position. If the Chinese Eastern Railway is cut into three sections, everything will be devalued. If the Soviet Union wants to maintain it by force, it will have to use force. However, the Soviet Union is a staunch advocate of pacifism and is unwilling to provoke external challenges, especially to send troops to fight for the Chinese Eastern Railway. Strategically and in terms of practical benefits, it is not cost-effective and unwise. Therefore, it decided to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to observe the changes in the world political situation. From this, we can see that both Japan and the Soviet Union are engaging in intrigue and each using their diplomatic skills to win future victories without resorting to force.</p>
<p>2.  Future Speculation</p>
<p>In this state of tension and relaxation in the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union, some people are very skeptical, while others are very fearful. Those who are skeptical believe that the resolution of the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is closely related to China, and we cannot sit idly by, nor can we take any active countermeasures. Those who are fearful are concerned that the tension between Japan and the Soviet Union will gradually increase. No matter how long it is delayed, war is only a matter of time. Whether they win or lose, it will not be good for our country and is very dangerous. But these speculations are not their fundamental intentions today. Because if they were to start a war with the Soviet Union today, even if they completely occupied the coastal provinces with military force, they would need to send at least 1.5 million troops. Occupying these places would not bring much economic benefit to Japan in reality. The maximum benefit would only be the monopolization of North Sea fisheries and a portion of the forests in northwest Siberia. As for the oil in the northern part of Sakhalin Island, whether Japan can seize it is still a question.</p>
<p>The current Soviet Union is very different from what it was fifteen years ago. When Japan sent troops to Siberia in 1919, the Far Eastern Republic refused to yield. Now, of course, it will resist. If the war drags on, the Soviet Union's base, west of the Ural Mountains, will not be damaged in the slightest. No matter how brave the Japanese army is, it will never be able to cross Chita westward, and its planes will not be able to fly past the west side of Lake Baikal. Conversely, if Japan cannot quickly occupy Vladivostok, the Red Air Force will inevitably threaten Japan's important cities. How can Japan's buildings withstand the bombing of incendiary bombs? Although the Japanese warlords are eager to advance, they are quite clear about this kind of calculation. The reason why they are still vigorously publicizing the tense situation is to consolidate the military and political foundation for occupying the four northeastern provinces. Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations in anger is not beneficial to itself. Moreover, the Soviet Union has recently formally joined the League of Nations, and there will be a major change in the international situation. Japan, of course, cannot continue to interfere arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Since the policy of attacking Siberia cannot be implemented, will they change direction and move westward to obtain wool-producing areas? Although there are many deserts in Inner Mongolia, the southern part of the desert is rich in water and grass, and it does not require much military force or sophisticated weapons. With a little political maneuvering, they can do whatever they want. If the goal is achieved, there are even more important cotton-producing areas that can be seized. This is the main need of Japan's basic industry. Even if major sacrifices are made, it is worth it. Moreover, they estimate the current situation and believe that they can steadily seize it without using force. At this time of complicated relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, we should pay full attention and beware of Japan's strategy of attacking the east and striking the west.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Japan's Situation Three Years After the September 18th Incident <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Although Japan is a late-developing capitalist country, its domestic market still has room for development, and its foreign market has the potential for expansion in neighboring areas. However, since 1929, it has been greatly affected by the economic panic. The lives of ordinary people are directly threatened, and even ordinary industrial capitalists are groaning in pain under the "recession". Therefore, in the summer of 1931, it decided to launch a major incident that shocked the world and was unprecedented. This incident has three effects on Japan: First, it opened up Japan's economic territory and expanded its monopoly market; second, it used the extraordinary period to unite the whole country to subdue the panic at home, suppress so-called democratic politics, abandon parliamentary struggles, and implement military dictatorship; third, as a result of military expansion, large-scale immigration can be realized, and the overcoming of panic and the revitalization of industry will all emerge together, so that Japanese imperialism can be greatly developed.</p>
<p>However, after the September 18th Incident, what is the actual situation? What has Japan gained? Is it really as it hoped? While we are deeply saddened, let's look at ourselves and see what the enemy is really like. Japan's special economic territory in the Far East has indeed expanded, and the development of monopoly industries has surpassed even Germany before the Great War. And because of the intensification of the extraordinary period, the power of monopoly is becoming more and more developed. Naturally, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and other financial groups are allowed to operate in the Northeast. Even its domestic industries, such as shipyards, ironworks, sulfuric acid plants, and chemical factories, are directly or indirectly related to military affairs and have gained great benefits. For example, the production of pig iron, which can be used as raw materials for military industries, increased by 31% (in 1933 compared to 1932), steel increased by 26% in the same period, and sulfur increased by 34%. The chemical industry, such as caustic soda, increased by 49.5%. Soda powder increased by 49.8%. Calcium cyanamide increased by 39.4%. Bleaching powder increased by 38.4%. These situations are all factors that activate the Japanese industrial sector and are the origin of improved market conditions. But in reality, the capitalists who benefited, directly or indirectly related to the military industry, and showing the so-called "boom" numbered only 3,000. These 3,000 people, of course, include those monopoly industrial and financial capitalists. The rest of the working masses want to be warm and full but cannot. Ordinary industrial capitalists are still subject to the pressure of economic panic.</p>
<p>Parliamentary politics has never had much power in Japan, and democratic constitutionalism has never shown any merit in Japanese politics. Its political form, the tendency of dictatorship, remained even during the period when democratic thought was at its peak after the European War. In recent years, economic panic has spread throughout the world. If Japan wants to escape this panic, it must do its best to use economic monopoly and strengthen the power of financial capital. Political actions also take the same path, raising the banner of the extraordinary period and making the general public act together under the call of militarism. In addition to the army's large-scale exercises in spring and autumn, there are also large-scale naval exercises. Recently, there have been large-scale air defense exercises in Osaka and Tokyo, making the entire nation nervous, with a strong sense of war, to shift the people's chewing on the pain in their lives. But the general public, especially the industrial workers in the cities and the small and medium farmers in the countryside, are all dying and lifeless as a result of excessive labor. They seem to have nothing to do with the so-called extraordinary period and the so-called national unity. They only feel that the pressure of life is higher than all spiritual stimulation.</p>
<p>Immigrating to "Manchuria" is one of the main goals of Japan's provocation of the September 18th Incident. They believe that with such a vast fertile field in the three northeastern provinces, coupled with Japan's painstaking management over the past twenty-eight years, there should be no problem with immigrating to the Northeast. Moreover, many facilities, military protection, transportation development, and actual economic assistance have been increased. All Japanese who move to the three eastern provinces are lent 1,000 to 2,000 Japanese yen by their government-designated banks to operate agriculture. Moreover, an immigration area is designated in Jiamusi, Jilin, and armed immigrant groups are organized. The Japanese government not only lends them money but also issues self-defense weapons, such as rifles and light machine guns. The protection can be said to be thorough, and the design cannot be considered unelaborate. But from September 18th to now, the number of armed immigrant groups organized is only 2,000, and more than one-third of them have fled back to Japan. Why did this immigration plan fail? First, the climate in the Northeast is not suitable for the life of Japanese people; second, agricultural operation is the hardest work, especially in the semi-developed area of Jiamusi, Northeast, which is even more difficult for Japanese to endure; third, the area for growing rice in the Northeast is not large, and the cultivation of sorghum and soybeans is not familiar to Japanese farmers. Therefore, he used great effort to immigrate, and as a result, only more than 2,000 intellectuals were moved to the puppet state to serve as officials. Most of these officials were also infected with the toxic substance because of the use of toxic policies and became opium addicts and womanizers.</p>
<p>The result of Japan's invasion is that only 3,000 large capitalists in his country have actually benefited, and only a few thousand down-and-out intellectuals have been placed in the puppet state. However, 120,000 soldiers are needed to protect them, and they are all wartime equipment. This is increasing the burden on the general public. It is indeed sacrificing the interests of the entire nation for the convenience of a very few people. Until now, it not only has to continue, but also has to deepen its extent.</p>
<p>Although Japan is known as a newly emerging industrial country, its number of farming households is 5.63 million, and its population is 28 million. Therefore, the rural economy still occupies a very important position. This year, the price of raw silk has fallen, and there is little hope of future sales. The revenue of the spring silkworm harvest for farmers will be lost by 350 million Japanese yen due to the drop in the price of cocoons alone. As a result, the general rural areas have fallen into the misery of starvation. Especially after the price of rice has risen sharply, on the surface, large farmers seem to have gained some benefits, but more than 2.63 million Japanese farmers are small and medium farmers with less than one cho (14.8 acres) of arable land. Their annual income is only enough to keep them warm and full, and there is little surplus. As a result of the extreme decline in the market prices of agricultural products over the years, tenant farmers are exhausted, and self-cultivating farmers are equally overwhelmed. Now, they have to buy rice at a high price with the money they sold grain at a cheap price last year. In the past, the Japanese rural economy of cocoons and a bag of rice was a legitimate and reasonable economic organization. At that time, the farmers only knew that labor was sacred and did not know about economic panic. Now, as a result of hard work, they are even unable to eat enough!</p>
<p>At the end of June this year, the Japan Imperial Agricultural Association investigated that at least 15% to 30% of farmhouses had insufficient rice; and the actual lack of rice was much greater. In particular, in silkworm-raising areas, the lack of rice was as high as 80%. For example, in Ishikawa County, Ibaraki Prefecture (according to a survey by the county agricultural association), 6,021 of the 14,087 farmhouses lacked rice, accounting for 44% of the farmhouses in the county. For example, in Minamisaku County, Nagano Prefecture, although farmers are working hard on the so-called rural self-reliance, most farmhouses eat barley rice; they reluctantly start cutting wheat before it is fully ripe, and many people sell it as soon as it is harvested. In Shizuka Village, Sarushima County, Ibaraki Prefecture, almost all of the 470 households lack rice. In some places belonging to Nagano Prefecture, some even eat tree roots and grass seeds! It is much more serious than four years ago. It is already very common and unsurprising that elementary school teachers cannot get paid and taxes are paid late. This is just a summary of the outline to see a glimpse of the whole. After the Okada Cabinet was formed, it proposed to sell the government's stored rice to the people. In fact, this cannot alleviate the hunger of the farmers, because she is not giving the rice to the farmers, nor is she lending it, but selling it at a lower price. However, it is well known that it is difficult for the average farmer to raise one yen, and it is naturally even more painful to buy rice to eat. Since the rural economy is so declining, the urban industry is also limited to a small number of capitalists who operate military industries. And the vast majority of the people are all floating in the tide of "recession". Because of the fluctuations in life, the general thoughts are also changing drastically. Whether it is the far-right nationalist party or the far-left communist party, they are all dissatisfied with the status quo and have their own reactionary behaviors, which makes the status quo even more uneasy. After the May 15th Inukai Incident, many people were prosecuted by far-right groups such as the Blood Pledge Corps, and their activity is gradually decreasing. Left-leaning thought is spreading particularly widely, and it naturally spreads quickly among workers and peasants. It is not easy for the Japanese government to crack down on it. What it is cracking down on is only a part of the knowledgeable youth and the restriction on publication. In the upper class, children of nobles are also deeply infected with degenerate thoughts and sympathize with the revolution, and even many people actually participate. This is nothing short of showing Japan's own internal contradictions. From real life to thought, everything is undergoing drastic changes. This is indeed Japan's hidden worry.</p>

<p>It is Said They Have No Special Mission</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese Ambassador to the US, Saito, and the Ambassador to France, Sato Imamura, arrived in Peiping by the newly opened Peiping-Shenyang railway. Representatives from various circles, both Chinese and Japanese, welcomed them at the station. This trip is said to be of a sightseeing nature, with no special mission. This afternoon, they plan to visit various military and political authorities separately. Saito is scheduled to leave for Tianjin tomorrow, and Sato is scheduled to leave Peiping the day after tomorrow. Then, Saito will return to his country via Northeast China and Korea because he needs to return to the United States before October 9th. Sato will go to Qingdao, Jinan, and Shanghai from Tianjin and return to his country by sea. He said he has no comments on the places he passes through due to the limited time. The diplomatic relationship between China and Japan is a delicate issue, and its future direction cannot be solved like a mathematical problem with a fixed formula. To maintain peace in East Asia, the two countries must coexist and prosper. A long period of reconciliation is needed to harmonize the national sentiments of the two countries before the deadlock can be broken and normalcy can be restored. If the Soviet Union joins the League of Nations, it can only be celebrated as a diplomatic success. As for the future outcome, it depends on the changes in the situation. The return of the US Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific is not to threaten Japan; its main purpose is to practice passing through the Panama Canal, but it also contains the intention of preventing accidents from happening in the Far East. Currently, the United States does not have hostile intentions towards Japan. Recently, the United States proposed amending the Immigration Act of 1924, which restricts people of color, and it is expected that the parliament will pass it. In the future, the treatment of ethnic groups in the Far East can be improved. Japan's countermeasures for the naval disarmament conference will not be disclosed before the meeting. However, its general outline has about two main points: to discuss disarmament in the spirit of genuine disarmament, and to seek fair treatment with a fair attitude. Our military and political authorities will hold a banquet at the Jurentang tonight. (17th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) Luo Fang's bandit troops, the pseudo-1st and 9th Army Corps, are cut off. There is panic within the bandit ranks. Moreover, because their incursions into Fujian have repeatedly suffered惨败, they resent each other. Luo Fang's two troops have disagreements. Recently, due to water and soil maladjustment, many bandits are suffering from autumn epidemics, and dozens are dying every day. The bandits, fearing that they will be completely surrounded, have joined forces to break through and flee in disarray from Canxi through Muyemiaowan Village to the area east of the road to Malu. Our army has been tracking and searching, looking for opportunities to advance and suppress them. The garrisons in Longquan and Suichang have made strict arrangements to intercept them. In addition, a certain unit of the 49th Division pursued and suppressed the bandits who fled from Songxi to Dongping, engaging in a fierce battle for six hours, killing more than 40 bandits and capturing countless others. Wu Chengren sent a telegram to the provincial government reporting that Songxi and Zhenghe counties are now peaceful. The remaining bandits of Tang Yubao, because our army's defenses are tight, took advantage of the night to flee to Lianjiang's Pantangling, Yinglv, and other villages, wantonly looting. Our search and suppression troops have arrived at their destination and completed their deployment, and have begun to encircle and suppress them. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Sun Ke chaired the meeting and reported on the latest international situation, briefly stating that the United States is currently working hard on economic recovery to solve the economic downturn. For agriculture, due to overproduction of agricultural products, strict austerity measures are being implemented. For industry, strict control of various industries is still being implemented, tightening production, and reducing working hours. This kind of recovery plan is only a temporary solution, not a fundamental solution, because although production is reduced, purchasing power has not increased at all. The effect is yet to be seen, but its trend will undoubtedly lead to a controlled economy as its national policy. As for the situation in Europe, Germany is actually the center. France is afraid that Germany will overthrow the Treaty of Versailles, and Russia is expanding its strength in the areas of Poland and Ukraine. Italy is afraid that Germany will merge Austria-Hungary and encroach on the Balkans. Therefore, France and Russia are working together, and France and Italy have reached an understanding. The Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is all about縱横裨　 for its own interests. If Russia joins the League of Nations and cooperates with France, it will be able to concentrate its attention on the Far East. We must not neglect the international situation in our country. After the speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned. Sun then went to the airport and left Beijing for Jiangxi. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Turkey, Spain, and Chile are Elected</p>
<p>Our Failure to be Re-elected is a Loss to the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Issue of Russia's Accession is Referred to a Committee for Review</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly considered the re-election of the non-permanent members of the Executive Council this morning. China only received 21 votes and was therefore defeated, as 34 votes were required for election. Turkey was elected as a representative of Asian countries. The General Assembly reconvened at 3:30 pm. Turkey, Chile, and Spain were formally elected as members of the Executive Council. Most representatives believe that China's defeat is a victory for Japan. Unofficial Japanese representatives have been saying here that Japan considers China's re-election to be unfavorable. On the other hand, because Turkey has close relations with Soviet Russia, its election is also a thorn in Japan's side. Soviet Russia's position is strengthened by Turkey's election, and the Franco-Russian group in the League of Nations is also more powerful. It is now heard that at least one country will vote against Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations. The Dutch delegation has received instructions from The Hague to vote against Soviet Russia. The Soviet Russian government had previously stated unofficially that it would only consider joining the League of Nations if it received a unanimous vote. However, since the matter has progressed to its current stage, Soviet Russia will not反汗. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations elected three non-permanent members of the Executive Council. Chile was elected with 52 votes, Spain with 51 votes, and Turkey with 48 votes, as expected. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chile, Spain, and Turkey have all been elected as non-permanent members of the Executive Council of the League of Nations. Chile is replacing Panama of the Americas, Spain is being re-elected, and Turkey is replacing China of Asia. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) China's request to obtain the right to be re-elected as a non-permanent member of the Executive Council of the League of Nations has been rejected by the League of Nations General Assembly. When the General Assembly opened this morning, out of the 52 countries attending the General Assembly, only 21 countries expressed support for China's request to use a roll-call vote. According to the law, it must obtain a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly, namely 35 votes, to pass. Therefore, China's request for re-election was rejected. At this point, Turkey is the only candidate for the Asian seat on the Executive Council of non-permanent members. The General Assembly then raised the issue of the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations, which was submitted to the Sixth Committee (ie, the Political Committee) for review. At the same time, the President of the General Assembly, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, reported the resolution of the Executive Council, advocating giving the Soviet Union a permanent seat on the Executive Council and asking the General Assembly to approve it. The General Assembly then agreed to take other measures to ensure that the Executive Council's resolution takes effect. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>The League of Nations Becomes More Europeanized</p>
<p>Representative Guo is Very Disappointed</p>
<p>(Geneva) China failed to regain its seat on the Executive Council. The League of Nations General Assembly rejected its request for re-election. Therefore, Turkey's election has no obstacles. Of the 52 countries that voted, China only received 21 votes, which is less than two-thirds or 35 votes. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi criticized this and said, "This is a loss for the League of Nations, not a loss for China. Judging from the results of the voting at the General Assembly, it can be seen that the League of Nations is becoming more and more Europeanized. Many countries that promised to vote for China did not fulfill their promises, especially the South American countries." Since China's election has failed, Turkey, Chile, and Spain can definitely be elected as members of the Executive Council this afternoon. The General Assembly's decision is, of course, disappointing to the Chinese side. However, the Turkish representatives here have known about this result for the past few days, because the Turkish representatives claimed that Turkey has received sufficient assistance to dispel China's hope of re-election. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of China attending the League of Nations General Assembly and the Minister to the United Kingdom, recently issued a statement expressing disappointment over the League of Nations General Assembly's rejection of China's re-election as a non-permanent member of the Executive Council. Guo said that in the current environment, the League of Nations General Assembly should give China the right to be re-elected as a member of the Executive Council. In the future, China's inability to attend the Executive Council is deeply concerned that the situation in the Far East will become more serious as a result. Although some Chinese newspapers have mentioned that if China cannot be re-elected as a member of the council, it may withdraw from the League of Nations, but people here believe that China will not take this action. The procedure of the General Assembly regarding China's re-election as a non-permanent member of the Executive Council is as follows: China must obtain a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly to have the right to be re-elected. If China's right to be re-elected has obtained a two-thirds majority, then it only needs a majority of the votes to be elected when electing non-permanent members. If so, China will definitely be elected, and it is undoubtedly that Turkey will be defeated. Now that China has not obtained a two-thirds majority, then Turkey is the only candidate for the Asian seat of a non-permanent member with a majority of the votes. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations General Assembly opened this morning, most of the conversations in the General Assembly rest room were about the competition between China and Turkey for the Asian seat of a non-permanent member of the Executive Council. The representatives of the General Assembly were divided into two factions regarding China's re-election. Some representatives advocated adhering to the policies adopted by the League of Nations due to the Sino-Japanese dispute, and supported China's re-election. However, other representatives considered it solely from the perspective of European politics, so they were more inclined towards Turkey. After China's re-election was rejected, people at the scene were quite shocked. Since some delegations to the General Assembly opposed China's re-election, it was generally believed that the re-election of the quasi-permanent members Spain and Poland would also be opposed. Therefore, China's rejection of re-election may affect Spain's re-election. After Spain's re-election was approved by a two-thirds majority, the doubts were dispelled. At this point, Turkey is the only candidate for the Asian seat of non-permanent members, and its election is naturally not a problem. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Awaiting the Results of the Political Committee Before Appearing on the Scene</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet officials are naturally satisfied with the decision made by the League of Nations Council regarding the Soviet Union's entry into the League. The Soviet Union's policy has long been to enhance its international standing and gain recognition for its new Soviet political system. The League of Nations' recognition of the Soviet Union is a result of this policy. Soviet officials are also very pleased that all major powers, including Poland, have signed the invitation. Even if a few countries take a dissenting stance, it will not diminish the significance of the Soviet Union's entry into the League. The composition of the Soviet delegation to the League of Nations is currently unknown. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov is waiting near Geneva for news regarding the Soviet Union's entry into the League. Once the results of the Sixth Committee's discussion are announced, Litvinov will be brought into the assembly hall. The President of the General Assembly, Sandler, will deliver a welcome speech, to which Litvinov will respond. It is unknown whether French Foreign Minister Barthou will also speak at that time. If the scheduled procedures remain unchanged, the Soviet Union will become a member of the League of Nations starting Tuesday evening. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Sixth Committee may discuss the Soviet Union's entry into the League on Monday afternoon. The formal voting by a two-thirds majority of the members to approve the Soviet Union's entry procedures will be held on Tuesday afternoon. The Times' opinion on this matter is as follows: "The invitation for the Soviet Union's entry has been signed by two-thirds of the member states present. The General Assembly vote will undoubtedly pass, so the Soviet Union's membership is beyond doubt. However, some representatives may raise reservations during the Main Committee's discussion. Given the immense significance of the Soviet Union's entry in international politics, and from the League of Nations' perspective, it is a policy that should be tested. If it unfortunately fails at the outset, the responsibility will be extremely heavy, and no one dares to bear it. Therefore, people in Geneva are generally cautious to prevent failure at the last moment." (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, commented on the Soviet Union's agreement to join the League of Nations, saying: "The invitation from the majority of member states of the League of Nations to the Soviet Union to join, and the Soviet Union's acceptance of this invitation, has immense political significance in itself, without a doubt."</p>
<h3 id="e38">Original Purpose of the League of Nations <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>"At the beginning of the formation of the League of Nations, it was an organization of victorious countries. Its sharp edge was directed not only at defeated countries, but also at the first nation of working masses building socialism that was rising at that time, and it was also the target of its arrows. However, the attempt by the victorious capitalist countries to force the Russian workers and peasants to submit to their will was ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of the masses of people under the rule of the former Tsarist Russia."</p>

<p>"Although the Soviet government was surrounded by a capitalist world full of hostility, it was ultimately able to extract our country from the ruins caused by the imperialist world war and guide it into the path of socialist construction. The proletarian revolution and the seventeen-year history of the Soviet Union have now enabled our country's economic, political, and cultural strength to achieve astonishing growth. The Soviet Union is using this growth as a foundation to build its Red Army, which is sufficient to crush any attack and defend this Soviet Union."</p>

<p>"However, the strength of the Soviet Union has not led it into military adventures or the path of what capitalist rumour-mongers call 'Red Imperialism.' The Soviet Union has become the centre of the struggle for peace. It not only extends its hand to its neighbours, signing non-aggression pacts with them, but also participates in all peace conferences convened by the League of Nations, even though the League of Nations still harboured a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union at that time. The Soviet Union once proposed the most thorough disarmament plan, but it was not accepted. Although the Soviet Union's activities at the Disarmament Conference also had their limitations, it has proven that only the Soviet Union is the only country that can provide adequate guarantees for peace. The Soviet government's policy of peace has even led most of its enemies to acknowledge the sincerity of its peace initiatives."</p>
<h3 id="e41">Two Opposing Camps <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>"The position gained by the Soviet Union's firm policy has created a situation where the majority of member states of the League of Nations now propose that the Soviet Union join the League. At present, the capitalist world is divided into two camps. Some major powers, at this stage in history, are not striving for war because they fear that if war breaks out, their original spoils of war will be lost. Other major powers are extremely dissatisfied with the status quo and are preparing for adventurous actions, seeking a way out of the current situation through war. The withdrawal of Germany and Japan from the League of Nations is precisely to free themselves from the constraints imposed on them by the League of Nations Covenant."</p>

<p>"Those major powers that are willing to maintain peace have already realised that if the Soviet Union does not join the League of Nations, their struggle for peace will be in vain. If the League of Nations does not have the participation of this country that acts as a darling of peace, it will not be able to gain the trust of the masses. France can be called prescient among the major powers. It was the first to understand the importance of the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace and initiated the invitation for the Soviet Union to participate in the activities of the League of Nations in order to strengthen the League's peace policy."</p>

<p>"The Soviet Union is aware of all the shortcomings of the League of Nations. These shortcomings are a reflection of the social nature of the representative governments. The Soviet Union knows that the League of Nations has never been able to take any serious steps to safeguard peace in the past. However, the Soviet Union understands that some countries participating in the League of Nations are indeed willing to defend peace. Therefore, the Soviet government views it as its duty to respond to the invitation of the majority of countries in the League of Nations in order to use this international institution, which, as Stalin put it, may, after the withdrawal of some of the countries most inclined to war, become 'a wavering barrier to delay or prevent the outbreak of war,' or 'an obstacle on the road that can at least hinder the arrival of war and contribute somewhat to peace.' The aforementioned words of Stalin are taken from his conversation with the American journalist Duranty. Stalin further stated in that conversation: 'If historical facts develop in this way, then our assistance to the League of Nations (even with its huge shortcomings) is also not entirely impossible.' The development of history has proceeded as Stalin predicted, so the Soviet Union has accepted the League of Nations' invitation."</p>

<p>"In accepting the invitation, the Soviet government has not forgotten to state the fact that some member states of the League of Nations (not to mention those that have already withdrawn) have even more hostility towards countries building socialism than they have fear of war. Therefore, while sincerely welcoming the Soviet government's preparations to join the League of Nations, Soviet public opinion should never forget one sentence: that peace depends primarily on two factors: one is the desire for peace among the masses of all countries in the world, and the other is the strength of the Soviet Union. The stronger the Soviet Union is, and the stronger the Red Army's ability to defend its borders and independence is, the more the imperialist adventurers will fear the implementation of aggressive policies (the ultimate result of which will be their complete annihilation). At the same time, the Soviet Union's position in the struggle for peace will be even more consolidated. The Soviet Union's preparations to join the League of Nations are intended to continue its struggle for peace." (17th TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>French Foreign Minister is Conducting Diplomatic Activities</p>
<p>The Key to the Success or Failure of the Convention Lies with Britain</p>
<p>(Geneva) Countries are now drafting a convention to guarantee Austria's independence and territorial integrity. The convention is currently being drafted by Italian representative Aloisi, but it has encountered some difficulties on the British side. According to the draft, the convention will first be signed by Britain, France, Italy, and the Little Entente countries (Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia), and then joined by Germany, Hungary, and other countries. Britain's current decision is not to provide any new promises to the continent. Regarding the issue of Austrian independence, Britain, France, and Italy jointly issued a declaration on June 17 this year, expressing the three countries' desire to respect Austria's independence. The British government is currently unwilling to take any further action beyond the aforementioned declaration. Given this situation, the initiators of this convention should first make efforts in London. As for how to guarantee Austria's independence, it is too early to discuss. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Times' Geneva correspondent commented on the issue of Austrian independence, stating that Foreign Minister Barthou invited Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, Austrian Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg, Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans, Irish Free State President de Valera, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Batzarov, Greek Foreign Minister Maximos, and Romanian Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Radulescu to lunch today. Now that the Soviet Union's membership issue has been resolved, the only remaining issue is Austrian independence. This can be seen from the qualifications of the people invited by Barthou. The issue of Austrian independence occupies a primary position in Geneva politics. What is now being sought is to enhance the existing guarantees for Austrian independence. Italian representative Aloisi is currently conducting research to find a practical way to express the unanimous opinion of the countries in Geneva on this matter. The plan to conclude a convention among Austria's neighbouring countries to guarantee Austria's independence is still under consideration. However, the Little Entente countries believe that the conclusion of this convention will reduce the expectations of the League of Nations. In short, Austria is the key to European peace, and there is no question that its independence must be guaranteed. However, whether the member states of the League of Nations will still ask the League of Nations to provide special protection for Austria, or whether they will establish new methods, is difficult to say at this time. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg departed from here at 11:00 AM to return to Vienna. Negotiations on the draft convention to guarantee Austria's independence will continue this week. However, Britain's attitude remains hesitant due to fears of increasing its obligations to the European continent, and the Little Entente countries also have concerns. Therefore, the convention to guarantee Austria's independence seems to be leaning towards the format of the Locarno Treaties, providing guarantees within the scope of the League of Nations, stipulating that if Austria's independence is violated, the League of Nations Council will intervene. In short, this issue is still in the exploratory stage. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Saar Issue Will Be Discussed Next Week</p>
<p>The National Minority Issue Will Be Submitted for Review</p>
<p>Negotiations on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact are in Progress</p>
<p>(Geneva) Barthou will depart for France on Wednesday to attend Friday's cabinet meeting and will return to Geneva within the next week to discuss the Saar issue. The Saar Special Committee, chaired by Aloisi (consisting of three people, namely Aloisi of Italy, Cantilo of Argentina, and de Madariaga of Spain), is currently studying the French memorandum regarding the foreign recruitment of police in the Saar to maintain order during the plebiscite. The Special Committee advocates that the countries designated by the Saar Administrative Commission should recruit separately. This matter seems to have been confirmed. The issue of national minorities raised by Polish Foreign Minister Beck will inevitably be raised again in the General Assembly. However, the public is already reassured that Foreign Secretary Simon of Britain, Foreign Minister Barthou of France, and Italian representative Aloisi have raised the issue, and Beck does not intend to respond to it in the General Assembly. This issue will be submitted to the Sixth Committee for review, and the manner of its presentation may be more legitimate than what Beck said. Regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, the Warsaw government has not yet formally responded. At the beginning of the issue, Barthou discussed the matter with Beck for one and a half hours. It is said that at that time, Beck was not completely opposed to the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, but he was also not very much in favour of it. The two sides then agreed that Beck's verbal expression would be explained in writing by the Polish government. Afterwards, due to various events, the official document that Beck had agreed to send has not yet been delivered to Barthou. However, the general public believes that the work of the League of Nations General Assembly can proceed quietly, without</p>

<h3 id="e51">U.S. Fleet Completely Transferred to the Pacific to Monitor the Progress of the Far Eastern Situation, the Navy Does Not Change Its Original Policy <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Hampton Roads, USA) The U.S. Combined Fleet concentrated here today to prepare to return to the Pacific. The so-called Atlantic (back door) is now completely open and undefended. The entire fleet is scheduled to set sail tomorrow, with several submarine teams joining along the way. Autumn manoeuvres will be held in the Caribbean Sea. On November 1, the fleet will pass through the Panama Canal. The so-called Combined Fleet is composed of the heavy battleship fleet that has been stationed in the Pacific for many years and the lighter scout fleet that was originally stationed in the Atlantic. Since Japan occupied Manchuria and the Far East, the Combined Fleet has been concentrated in the Pacific for two years. This year, it was transferred to the Atlantic for only six months. At the time, the situation in the Far East was calm, so officials stated that it was to allow naval personnel to take the opportunity to return home. However, observers believed that this was to show Japan that the United States was adopting a defensive posture in the Pacific in order to ease the tense situation in the Far East. The U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific this time is also part of the original plan and should not be seen as a change in policy. However, this move shows that the United States is focusing on its western front, believing that the turmoil in Europe will not immediately affect the U.S.'s position in the Atlantic. Some military experts believe that late autumn and early winter are the most dangerous periods in the Far East. If a Russo-Japanese war breaks out, it will inevitably begin when the northern rivers are frozen solid, so that land troops can move. The United States is therefore transferring its fleet back at this time. There is also a saying that if a war breaks out in Europe, a certain country in the Far East may take the opportunity to attack, so what the U.S. military is worried about is actually the Pacific. The U.S. fleet will also be stationed in the Pacific for a long time in the future, and Britain will have to pay attention to Europe and will have no worries about the East.

<p>National Air Routes Extend 50,000 Kilometres</p>
<p>Shortened Transportation and Ethnic Communication</p>
<p>(TASS, Moscow, August 13) August 18 is Aviation Day. Soviet cities and collective farms are actively preparing to celebrate the development of Soviet civil aviation since 1933. In the past five years, the total length of air routes has reached 9,326 kilometres, with over 21,000 passengers and 368 tons of mail and cargo transported. Since 1929, the Soviet Union has been manufacturing its own aircraft and engines, such as the ANT-14, ANT-9, K-5, P-5, and STAL-5. In addition to being used for transportation, aircraft are also widely used in agriculture and forestry, such as pest control, sowing, surveying, and sanitation. The total length of Soviet air routes is now around 50,000 kilometres, with major routes including the Moscow-Vladivostok line, the Moscow-Tbilisi line, and the Moscow-Tashkent line. Soviet air routes have connected all major economic and administrative centres in the country, and have also connected various remote ethnic areas. For example, there are now several air routes in Central Asia. The journey from Stalinabad to Khorog, which previously took 30 days, now takes only four hours. The same is true for the route from Yakutsk to Irkutsk. Previously, this route took 18 days in summer and 30 days in winter, but now it only takes two or three days. During the Second Five-Year Plan, Soviet air routes will increase to 85,000 kilometres, not including local routes. During this period, remote areas such as Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Yakutia, and Siberia will see the greatest development.</p>

<p>(Washington) Senator Nye, chairman of the U.S. Senate Munitions Investigating Committee, stated today that the committee will actively proceed to uncover the truth that the world should know and will not retreat. Next week, it will investigate the United Aircraft Corporation. It is said that this investigation may cause war. Nye stated today that the first step of the investigation can be completed next week, so protesting countries such as Britain, Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Argentina can be a little less anxious and wait to see the results. Nye further stated that "After all the facts are clear, those in the world who still want war should regard arms dealers as the enemy. All the provocations are done by them." According to Nye, the scope of the investigation will be unlimited. It is expected that the world will soon know that the arms business really needs to be restricted. The government must control the manufacturing and sale of all arms in order to avoid the danger of merchants disregarding humanity for profit. The activities of arms dealers are hindering the world's struggle for economic decline, because economic recovery depends entirely on balanced national budgets, which are completely ineffective if they need to be prepared for war at all times.

In addition, or the accounts are being checked, or they are being contacted, and those who are ready are actively proceeding separately. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the He Long bandit gang has been harassing Guizhou and has not yet been suppressed, while the Xiao Ke communist bandits have crossed western Hunan and invaded the border of Guangxi, plotting to join forces with the He Long department of Guizhou bandits. Just as the Guizhou border defense situation was extremely tense, news suddenly came that internal disputes had arisen again in Guizhou Province. The Guizhou army Wang (Jialie) and You (Guocai) combined and then separated. At the end of last month, You Guocai's Liao Huai-zhong division was completely resolved by Wang Jialie's troops. Yesterday, a telegram was received from Wang Jialie, reporting the inside story as follows: ( (Salutations omitted) Both are informed, confidential: After investigating the third division commander, Liao Huaizhong, he indiscriminately recruited bandits and refused to be incorporated. Furthermore, he fabricated words to discredit, and acted freely. As the Red Bandits were growing day by day, he could only accommodate the facts and treat them with indulgence. He was ordered to return to station in Yanhe Yinjiang to jointly suppress the bandits. Unexpectedly, the various bandit suppression troops defeated the bandit He Long, who retreated to the Ganchuanxiang junction in the area of Ganlongkou Xieyaojie. Just as he was preparing to unite with friendly troops from neighboring provinces to encircle and annihilate them, the division commander dared to collude with the Red Bandits and disrupt the rear defense, causing He Long to take the opportunity to break through and counterattack Si (Nan) Yin (Jiang), resulting in the failure of the bandit suppression plan. Moreover, the Red Bandit Xiao Ke rushed into Hunan and fled in a hurry. He was deeply afraid that it would harm the border area, so he would give the bandits a chance to spread. He immediately ordered the various bandit suppression troops to thoroughly resolve the department in order to avoid hindering the work of suppressing the Reds. Fortunately, the resolution was complete. Liao (Huaizhong) only left alone. The various armies continued to advance towards the bandit area, with daily progress. In addition to informing the friendly troops of neighboring provinces and issuing orders to all departments of our army, I hereby send a telegram to report. Wang Jialie, Qing (September), printed.

<h3 id="e110">Overview of Sino-Malaysian Trade in the First Half of the Year <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Exports Exceed Imports by Over 1.28 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Singapore Correspondence) Trade statistics for the first half of this year, from January to June inclusive, between the British Malaya in the Nanyang Islands and various ports in China have already been published. A general report is hereby specially made for the reference of domestic industrial and commercial circles. However, to reduce the number of digits, figures below a thousand are generally omitted.</p>
<p>It is found that the total value of goods imported into China from the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements in the first half of this year was 6,229,000 yuan in national currency, accounting for 1.09 per cent of China's total imports. The total value of Chinese goods transported to the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements was 7,518,000 yuan in national currency, accounting for 2.80 per cent of China's total exports, resulting in a surplus of 1,289,000 yuan. The number of Chinese residing in British Malaya totals more than 1.7 million, and their daily necessities are mostly Chinese goods. Therefore, for decades, China's trade with Malaya has consistently shown a surplus. However, since the September 18th Incident, when the four northeastern provinces were forcibly occupied by the Japanese, China's exports to Malaya have been greatly affected, resulting in a shift from surplus to deficit in Sino-Malaysian trade in 1932 and 1933, which was very unfavorable to China. It was not until the first half of this year that the surplus status was restored, which can be considered a considerable improvement. However, given the large Chinese population overseas, this minimal surplus cannot satisfy us.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, the main goods transported from Malaya to China and their values were: tin ingots and blocks, approximately 122,000 Haikwan taels (hereinafter the same); sea cucumbers, 164,000; dried shrimp and shrimp paste, 30,000; fish and seafood products, 101,000; preserved meat and daily necessities, 83,000; rice, 39,000; miscellaneous grains and flour, 35,000; fruits, 25,000; medicinal materials and spices, 245,000; pharmaceuticals, 39,000; dyes and colors, 92,000; coconut oil, 313,000; rubber and wax, 29,000; sole leather, 33,000; heavy timber, 263,000; railway sleepers, 6,000; teak, 117,000; sandalwood, 52,000; timber, 26,000; rattan, 376,000; rubber boots and shoes, 18,000; rubber tires, 4,000; rubber and rubber products, 734,000; other items, 91,000. The value of the above imported goods into China is calculated in Haikwan taels. In the first half of this year, according to the average price in Shanghai, each Haikwan tael was equivalent to 1.971 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>As for the total value of Chinese goods transported to Malaya in the first half of this year, it is also worth noting. According to statistics, fresh eggs amounted to approximately 69,000 yuan (hereinafter the same); eggs and egg products, 42,000; processed meat, 56,000; fish and seafood products, 39,000; lard, 75,000; soybeans, 2,000; beans and peas, 144,000; miscellaneous grains and flour, 21,000; bean cakes, 77,000; seed cakes and miscellaneous grain products, 24,000; fruits, 490,000; medicinal materials and spices, 102,000; peanut oil, 144,000; green tea, 99,000; cigarettes, 55,000; tobacco, 59,000; vermicelli and macaroni, 94,000; vegetables and plant products, 101,000; coal, 13,000; paper, 643,000; silk fabrics and embroidered items, 48,000; silk embroidery, 96,000; lace ornaments, 21,000; coarse twill fabrics, 43,000; market cloth and coarse cloth, 52,000; native cloth, 570,000; pure silk satins, 295,000; pure artificial silk satins, 176,000; silk fabric, 16,000; textiles and clothing parts, 742,000; metals and metal products, 74,000; porcelain, 29,000; clay, sand, stone, and their products, 38,000; chemicals and chemical products, 416,000; sugarcane and cane sugar, 75,000; other items, totaling approximately 336,000 yuan.</p>

<p>(Securities) New York: Before the opening of the securities market, the favorable factors for the market situation were (1) the Securities Exchange Management Committee seemed to be extremely cautious and did not want the issuance of new regulations to cause instability in bonds and major securities, and (2) the recent margin calls were reportedly not very enthusiastic. When the Securities Exchange opened this morning, the market situation was quiet, but the prices were still stable. Price fluctuations were all in single digits. However, the price of American Smelting and Refining shares rose by 0.01 pounds. Good news is still lacking, so the market does not seem to have improved much.

<h3 id="e112">The Righteous Army Led by Zhao Shangzhi Launches a Surprise Attack on a Puppet Ship <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Righteous Army's Elite Forces Wreak Havoc, Achieving Significant Results in Attacking Ships</p>
<p>Several Japanese Soldiers Killed in a Bloody Battle on the Songhua River</p>
<p>The City of Harbin Plunged into Terror as the Puppet Ship Returns</p>
<p>(Changchun Correspondence) In order to preserve Baoli, the righteous armies on all fronts in eastern Jilin have changed their strategies, with all cadres lying in wait in the nearby mountains and dense forests, awaiting an opportunity for a major offensive. However, in order to maintain the status quo and prevent shortages of military supplies, elite troops from each unit, fully equipped with weapons and ammunition, have been selected to form dozens of Righteous Army Advance Regiments. Each regiment is organized with a maximum of about 100 men, and they go to the railway and along the river, disguised as workers and travelers, launching surprise attacks that are unpredictable, creating multiple incidents of overturning trains and attacking ships, capturing and killing many Japanese soldiers. This is even more effective than the disorganized large armies of the righteous army. Although there are many armored trains and gunboats of the Japanese and puppet railway and maritime guards, the Righteous Army is elusive and their strategies are unpredictable. Therefore, the Japanese and puppet troops are exhausted, and the state of terror along the railway and on ships, and the occurrence of incidents, have not diminished. Recently, the Righteous Army launched another heroic act of surprise attack on a puppet ship near Di Da Zui Zi, seven kilometers downstream of the Songhua River from Harbin. On the 9th of this month, more than 30 members of the Righteous Army Advance Regiment led by Zhao Shangzhi, disguised as passengers and hiding weapons, boarded the puppet ship Yingkou Maru in Harbin. When they arrived at Di Da Zui Zi, they pulled out pistols to intimidate other passengers and crew members, instructing them to temporarily stop the ship, and immediately began searching for Japanese. Nearby, many sailing boats were ambushed in advance, full of Righteous Army soldiers, using a war strategy of attacking from inside and outside, causing the ship to fall into great chaos. Fighting sounds were heard in all the cabins. As a result, Sakaguchi, the puppet police chief of Hulin, killed three members of the Righteous Army, but because he ran out of bullets, he was eventually killed by the Righteous Army. Iwanaga Shizuo, the puppet councillor of Hulin County, jumped into the river and drowned. In addition, two brave men from the Gaohe County Public Office were seriously injured. In addition, two Japanese were missing, and Japanese women were captured. Two crew members and one soldier were also killed. More than 30 people were captured by the Righteous Army for ransom, and all the goods were taken away for military use. The Righteous Army left in sailing boats at 1:00 am the next morning. The surviving crew members only opened the ship to Harbin at 10:00 am. Blood flowed like rivers in the ship, and corpses lay everywhere, making the situation very tragic. Rumors spread in Harbin for a time, plunging the city into a state of terror. It was generally said that the Japanese gunboats patrolling the river could not eliminate the disaster in advance, which was extremely useless. The public opinion of the whole city also recognized that the power of the Righteous Army was inviolable, so people's hearts were extremely excited. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e113">Banditry Rampant Again in Luanyu Area <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Robberies Occur in Qinhuangdao in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Japanese and Korean Rogues Protect Criminals</p>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) Banditry in various places in eastern Tianjin has become increasingly rampant since the beginning of the Green Gauze Uprising. It is no longer surprising that bandits rob in towns during the day. Outside the towns, bandits are stationed, either in large or small groups, and there are more that cannot be counted. The number of bandits in large groups is two or three hundred, and in small groups, sixty or seventy. Kidnapping and extortion have made people unable to make a living. The security teams stationed by us in the Luanyu and Jiji-Mi areas of eastern Tianjin have a limited number of people, and only about half of them are truly dedicated to serving and vigorously suppressing bandits. The remaining half, not causing trouble to the local area and supplying bandits, is already considered to be the top of military discipline. If they are held accountable for serving the local area and defending merchants and people, it is difficult to say anything. The reason for the proliferation of bandits is first, because this year, the counties in northern Hebei suffered drought followed by floods, and the autumn harvest was poor, and the countryside was desolate; second, because Japanese and Korean rogues gathered and set up opium and gambling institutions everywhere, farmers were lured into them, their families were ruined, and those who abandoned agriculture became increasingly numerous. Therefore, there are fewer producers, and as a result of profit-sharing, a wind of seizing by force and plundering by force has evolved. Moreover, because the non-armed zone has special circumstances, offenders often seek foreign aid and have nothing to fear. Therefore, banditry has become increasingly rampant. The people of Zhoucun Village, Ji County, even form groups to paint their faces and rob silently at night. Although they know each other clearly, they do not report to the authorities. The number of bandits is the highest in any county. Banditry is even more rampant in Qinhuangdao City. Street robberies occur on quiet streets in broad daylight. The victims immediately report to the police, but they dare not chase after the robbers as they flee. Japanese and Korean rogues in the area have dozens of foreign firms, which not only sell morphine, heroin, and other highly toxic drugs, but also sell guns and ammunition. If bandits who cannot afford to buy guns are introduced by two or three accomplices, they can rent a gun for use. After the crime, the proceeds are split four to six. If the government's search and arrest are too urgent, they can temporarily hide in their foreign firms, which are responsible for their protection. As a result, the public security is chaotic, and it is almost impossible for the Public Security Bureau to maintain it. Outside Yu Pass, there are more than 20 large and small groups of bandits, each with 30 to 200 men. The area within three miles outside the city is the bandit-controlled area. Most of the police are unarmed. Last month, after negotiations by Su Yuqi, Director of the Public Security Bureau, the Japanese side agreed to increase 50 large guns. However, there are only 50 large guns and 20 pistols for more than 200 police officers in Yuguan, which is not enough to maintain the city, let alone take care of the outside of the city. Therefore, gunshots are constantly heard outside the city walls every night. At about 6:00 pm, there are few pedestrians outside the south and west gates. The Japanese special service agencies and the police stations of the Japanese Kwantung Army only pay attention to preventing incidents in the city and do not care about the fact that our people outside the city cannot sleep peacefully. Therefore, the area east of Tangshan is purely a world of bandits. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Amoy Taiwanese Murder Case Resolved <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Detectives and Taiwanese Reach Settlement Terms</p>
<p>(Xiamen Correspondence) On the evening of August 31, a conflict occurred among tourists at the Mei Zhou Tea House on Fuyu Road, He-He Road, and Taiwanese Lin Guimu (Jiadong) was shot and killed. At that time, Fang Jinpan, Deputy Captain of the Second Detective Team of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Public Security Bureau, led detectives to the scene to suppress the situation. Afterwards, the Taiwanese side pointed out that Lin Guimu was killed by a certain detective. Therefore, on the night of the 2nd, thugs shot and wounded Detective Lin Bo of the First Team at the Yuyan Coffee Shop on Siming South Road. Lin was seriously injured by three bullets. The thugs who fired the shots were identified as Taiwanese, and Lin Bo himself identified them as Taiwanese he knew well. After these two cases occurred one after another, people in the market were panicked, fearing that there would be further conflicts between the two sides. The Japanese consul made representations to the Public Security Bureau regarding the death of Lin Guimu, and the Public Security Bureau also made representations to the Japanese consul. However, after the night of the 2nd, Wang Guqing, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Ogawa Yonosuke, Chief of the Japanese Police Station, consulted with each other and agreed that both sides should restrain themselves and not make any changes before the case was resolved, so no further conflicts occurred. A private individual came forward to mediate between the detectives and the Taiwanese. However, the conditions put forward by both sides were extremely tough, and the perpetrators of both cases had fled the scene, leaving no evidence. Therefore, neither side would give in, and it remained unresolved for more than ten days. After repeated mediation by "public relatives" (Xiamen calls mediators "public relatives"), the terms were finally agreed upon on the evening of the 11th. On the evening of the 13th, another meeting was held, and from 9:00 pm to 1:00 am the next morning (14th), the representatives of both sides and the "public relatives" signed three reconciliation agreements, and each party held two copies. The original text of the reconciliation agreement is transcribed as follows: In the case of the shooting and killing of Taiwanese Lin Jiadong, the case was invited by the variable side on the afternoon of September 11th this year, together with "public relatives" Wu Yachun, Liu Zemin, Xie Shaozeng, and Gu Zhen, etc., and Taiwanese representatives He Xinghua, Lin Qingcheng, Wu Tianci, Wang Haisheng, Lin Zhigao, Zheng Deming, and Zhang Weiyuan, and detective representatives Lin Danian and Chen Qiucheng, etc., to Zhang Guanshu to discuss five conditions, which were agreed upon by both parties, and this agreement was established on this (13th) day, and its origin is recorded as above. Xiamen Lin Case Reconciliation Meeting, time: 9:00 pm, September 13, 23rd year of the Republic of China; location: Sanyou Restaurant, Siming South Road; Taiwanese representatives present: He Xinghua, Wu Tianci, Lin Zhigao, Zhang Weiyuan, Wang Haisheng, Chen Chunmu, Lin Qingcheng, Zhang Guanshu, Chen Changfu, Zheng Deming; detective representatives present: Lin Danian; "public relatives" Wu Yachun, Hu Zhen, Liu Zemin, Xie Shaozeng, Hong Xiaochun, Chen Ruiqing, Chen Qiucheng, Yan Yan, Lu Tianbao, and Huang Yishou; the reconciliation conditions are as follows: (1) The case of the shooting and killing of Taiwanese Lin Jiadong (the authorities now know who the perpetrator is) shall be handled by the Public Security Bureau immediately detaining the principal offender and accomplices and severely punishing them according to law. (2) "Public relatives" shall be engaged to raise 1,000 yuan for Lin Jiadong's funeral expenses. (3) The case of the shooting and wounding of Detective Lin Bo shall be handled according to law after the authorities have investigated the truth. (4) After this case is resolved, personnel from both sides shall not engage in similar incidents again to show friendship. (5) Regarding the shooting and killing of Lin Jiadong, it was caused by Fang Jinpan's inability to maintain order when he led the team to suppress the situation, resulting in the death. He voluntarily publishes an apology to the Taiwanese community to clarify his intentions. In addition to the above five articles, the matter will be handled by the official authorities of both sides. Taiwanese representatives He Xinghua, Wu Tianci, Lin Zhigao, Zhang Weiyuan, Wang Haisheng, Chen Chunmu, Lin Qingcheng, Zhang Guanshu, Chen Changfu, Zheng Deming; detective representative Lin Danian; "public relatives" Wu Yachun, Hu Zhen, Xie Shaozeng, Liu Zemin, Hong Xiaochun, Chen Ruiqing, Chen Qiucheng, Yan Dayuan, Lu Tianbao, and Huang Yishou, September 13, 23rd year of the Republic of China. Attached is the draft of Fang Jinpan's (Apology Statement) in its original text as follows: (In the case of the shooting and killing of Taiwanese Lin Jiadong, Jinpan led the team to suppress the situation, but was unable to maintain order at the time, resulting in the death. I feel deeply uneasy and hereby publish an apology to the Taiwanese community to clarify my intentions. Fang Jinpan, September 13, 23rd year of the Republic of China). At this point, the case between the Taiwanese and the detectives has been resolved. The Public Security Bureau and the Japanese consul only performed routine official duties and handled the matter in accordance with this agreement, which was also concluded. However, Lin Bo has already expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the reconciliation agreement only stated that his shooting injury would be investigated and handled, leaving the matter unresolved.</p>

<p>Approximately 20 Million Mu or More of Disaster-Stricken Fields</p>
<p>More Than 10 Million Disaster Victims</p>
<p>(Anqing Correspondence) The drought in Anhui Province this year has affected almost the entire province. Currently, 46 counties, including Huaining, have reported disasters. The disaster-stricken fields and population account for more than one-half of the total in the province. Central and southern Anhui have always been the main rice-producing areas, and the rice varieties are mostly early-maturing and mid-maturing. This year, from growth to fruiting, they have been in a drought period, and the damage is extremely severe. Northern Anhui mostly grows miscellaneous grains, such as broad beans and sesame, either due to lack of rain or withered after planting, and the disaster is also severe. In mid-June and July, farmers sold their clothes and used all their savings to hire workers to draw water from ponds and canals to maintain a lifeline for farming, hoping to reap the autumn harvest in one out of ten thousand. By August, not only did the farmers have nothing left, but they were also exhausted from poverty and illness and unable to draw water, and the water sources were also mostly exhausted, making it impossible to draw water for rescue, and they were almost completely trapped in despair. In order to provide disaster relief, the provincial government has organized a People's Food Regulation Committee and sent personnel to various counties to investigate the disaster situation. According to the investigation and statistics of 20 counties, including Wuhu, the disaster-stricken farmland has reached 10,333,000 mu or more, and the estimated number of disaster victims has reached 4,154,000 or more. Based on this estimate, the number of disaster-stricken fields in the 46 counties affected by the drought in the province should be between 20 million and 25 million mu, and the number of disaster victims should be more than 10 million. It is further estimated that the loss of agricultural products, using a minimum of 20 million mu as the standard, of which three-fifths are paddy fields, which are completely planted with rice, and each mu normally yields four stones of rice, and this year, approximately 48 million stones of rice have been lost. In addition, two-fifths of the dry land, approximately 5 million stones of millet, 3 million stones of beans, and more than 10 million stones of sesame seeds have been lost. To sum up, these are the overview and estimates of the drought in Anhui Province. The detailed situation still needs to be based on the statistics after the completion of the investigation by all the disaster investigation committee members. The statistics of the disaster-stricken fields and the population of disaster victims in the 20 counties, including Wuhu, which have already been reported, are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e116">Wang Zhan Yuan Passed Away <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>享年七十四歲 (Enjoyed a life of 74 years)</p>
<p>胃疾不治而死 (Died of an Untreatable Stomach Ailment)</p>
<p>天津通信 (Tianjin Correspondence) Former Inspector General of Hunan and Hubei Provinces, Military Governor and concurrently Governor of Hubei Province, Wang Zhan Yuan, died of an untreatable stomach ailment at 4 a.m. this morning at his residence on 14th Road in the British Concession of Tianjin. After his family issued mourning notices, former colleagues and subordinates, such as Sun Chuanfang, Jin Yunpeng, Yun E, Qi Xieyuan, and Pan Fu, all rushed to offer condolences and help with the funeral arrangements. Wang suffered from stomach ailments for many years, with periods of remission and relapse, but the condition worsened this spring. Wang did not take it seriously until two months ago, when he fell ill and could not get out of bed. He then sought treatment from famous Chinese and Western doctors in Beijing and Tianjin, but it was too late. His family and friends have scheduled the funeral for the 15th of this month, with a seven-day mourning period before transporting the coffin back to his ancestral home in Shandong Province. Wang, whose courtesy name was Zichun, originally named Xian, was a native of Guanxian County, Shandong Province. He was born on the 11th day of the first month of the tenth year of the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty and died at the age of 74. In the fifth year of the Guangxu era, he joined the right battalion of the Ming army as a soldier. In August of the twelfth year, he was selected to study at the Beiyang Military Academy. After graduating in the eighteenth year of Guangxu, he returned to military service and rose through the ranks to become the commanding officer of the First Standard of the First Army. During the Sino-Japanese War, Wang was under the command of Liu Mingchuan of the Xiang Army and fought in the Dalian and Yingkou areas, earning considerable merit. In the late Qing Dynasty, he rose to the rank of commander of the Second Army. In the early Republic of China, he was reorganized as the Second Division and served as its commander with the rank of lieutenant general. In July of the second year of the Republic, he was awarded the title of general. In the spring of the sixth year, he was appointed commander-in-chief for the suppression of bandits in Henan and Anhui, leading troops to quell the White Wolf bandit rebellion. In May of the same year, he was promoted to assistant to the military affairs of Hubei. In September of the ninth year of the Republic, he was promoted to military governor of Hubei and awarded the title of Zhuangwei General. In January of the fifth year, he was awarded the title of Xiangwu General. In July, he was appointed military governor and concurrently governor of Hubei and, in the ninth year, Inspector General of Hunan and Hubei. In the tenth year of the Republic, he retired to Tianjin, where he invested heavily in the Tianjin market, factories, mines, and various entertainment venues. Wang lived a simple life and owned real estate through his various businesses in Tianjin. Although he employed people to manage his affairs, he did not fully trust them and personally inspected them every morning. The people of Tianjin knew him as "Lord Wang the Seventh," no longer referring to his official title or name, but treating him as an elder. Even while ill, Wang continued to make inspections, ignoring his family's advice. In the early spring, his condition worsened, and he had difficulty walking, but he was still reluctant to spend money on medical treatment. It was not until his condition became critical that his family disobeyed his wishes and invited famous doctors from Beijing to diagnose him, spending more than 300,000 in two months. His nephews and nieces did not dare to tell Wang the truth, only reporting expenses of two or three thousand, but Wang still frowned upon hearing this. Wang's wife passed away early. He had three sons, Zhang Zekuan, Shu Zeshu, and He Zehe, all of whom are doing well. His nephew Zepei once served as the director of the Xinhe Commercial Bureau. His estate is estimated to be worth around three million, mostly in Tianjin land and stocks. In summary, Wang's life was neither exceptionally good nor bad. However, before the founding of the Republic, he followed Duan Zhigui in retreating to Baoding, contacted the revolutionary army of Li Yuanhong, and promoted the republic. During the Pingyuan Church Case in the sixth year of the Republic, he advocated for lenient handling, saving countless lives. His endorsement of troop reduction in the tenth year of the Republic were all notable achievements. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e117">Impersonating a Drug Enforcement Officer Arrested <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>（松江） (Songjiang) In the coastal towns of Punan County, the use of red pills is rampant, and the number of people addicted is increasing daily. Unscrupulous individuals are taking advantage of this situation to manufacture and sell them privately. Recently, a villager named Zhang bought red pills from a man named Weng. On his way out, he was stopped by someone impersonating a drug enforcement officer, who took him back to Weng's house and extorted over four hundred yuan, which they divided among themselves. The Public Security Bureau learned of this incident and secretly sent police officers to Caojing to investigate. They arrested Shen Xingsheng, Shen Bojun, Gu Huanzhang, Wu Zhonghua, and four others, who were taken back to the county bureau for interrogation and held under strict guard. It is unknown how this matter will be resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Pharmacist's Dissection of Newborn Nephew Causes Tragedy <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>(嘉定) (Jiading) The wife of Zhang Zhaoxi, the secretary of the Jiading County Government, gave birth at around 10:00 AM on the 9th of this month. They invited Tong Mingya, a midwife from the Jiading People's Hospital, to assist with the delivery. Ms. Tong brought her assistant, Ms. Yang Suyue, along with the necessary equipment. Upon arriving, they noticed a young man in the delivery room. Both Ms. Tong and Ms. Yang were surprised and inquired about his identity. They learned that his name was Wu Dangchun and that he was the doctor hired by the family. He was also a pharmacist at the Jiading Drug Rehabilitation Center and the brother-in-law of Secretary Zhang's wife. His sister was the one giving birth. At that time, the wife of Magistrate Xu was also in the room, as she was the sister of the one giving birth. Thus, Wu was also the brother-in-law of Magistrate Xu. Ms. Tong and the others considered themselves to be mere midwives, while Wu Dangchun was a formal doctor, a civil servant, and a close relative of the one giving birth. They naturally treated him with respect. Before the birth, the patient asked for a "labor-inducing injection," which was administered by Dr. Wu. When the baby was born, it didn't cry at first, which is common during childbirth. Ms. Yang held the baby upside down and gently patted its bottom, which caused it to make a faint sound. However, Dr. Wu suddenly claimed that this method would not save the baby and that Ms. Tong and Ms. Yang should focus on caring for the mother while he took care of the baby. Ms. Tong and Ms. Yang believed that as a doctor, Wu's experience and knowledge were superior to theirs. The mother also sided with her brother and disapproved of Ms. Yang's method of holding the baby upside down and gently patting it. Therefore, they handed the baby over to Wu. Ms. Tong and Ms. Yang focused on caring for the mother. After everything was finished, they saw the baby placed on a side bed, wrapped in a towel, without making a sound. They were shocked and asked Wu about it. Wu said that he had given the baby a stimulant injection, but it was too late to save it. Ms. Tong and Ms. Yang were disappointed when leaving. Wu then told Ms. Tong and Ms. Yang to take the baby with them. When they refused, Wu said, "We doctors should always be researching. Since this child died of breath-holding, we should examine it in detail to find out why. Please take it to your hospital, and I will come soon to examine it closely to find out the cause. This is something that medical students should do." Ms. Tong and Ms. Yang had no choice but to take the dead baby to the hospital. Soon after, Wu arrived at the hospital and sat in the reception room, inspecting the dead baby. It happened to be a Sunday, and because of financial constraints, the hospital did not have a resident doctor. Every Sunday, a doctor from the same hometown would take turns returning to Jiading from Shanghai to provide medical services at the hospital. As a result, many people were seeking medical attention, and the assistants were busy helping with prescriptions. They were unaware that the dead baby in the reception room was being subjected to a slow and painful dismemberment. Ms. Jin Ruizhen, a midwife at the hospital, happened to go to the reception room and saw a bloody mess. The so-called Dr. Wu Leichun was holding a sharp blade and dissecting the baby's feet. Ms. Jin was puzzled and asked Wu, "Is this a dissection?" Jin knew that although she had not practiced dissection, she had studied anatomy books and had never seen anyone dissect from the lower body first. She found it strange, but because he was a doctor and a civil servant, she dared not criticize him. Then, he cut open the abdomen and took out the heart and liver, and the heart was still beating. She asked Wu, "This baby doesn't seem to be dead yet. Why are you dissecting it without permission?" Wu replied, "What do you know? The proverb says, 'Even when a person is dead, the heart doesn't die.' The heart often continues to beat even three days after death." Although Jin agreed, she suspected him. She went out and told her colleagues. Xu Jihua, a female doctor on duty at the hospital, heard this and was shocked. She went to the reception room to see what had happened and found that none of his methods were correct. She questioned Wu about which medical school he had graduated from. Wu's face turned red, and he stammered, "I... I studied it at home." Xu rebuked him. Wu then collected the baby's bones and flesh and left. This incident happened a week ago, but the people in the hospital kept it a secret because Wu was related to the magistrate. However, the news eventually leaked out, causing a great uproar in society. Everyone believed that since Wu was a doctor, his obstruction of the emergency measures of holding the baby upside down and gently patting it when the baby didn't cry after birth was already strange. His unauthorized dissection under the guise of examination was even more bizarre, and the fact that the dissection was not performed properly was even more astonishing. It was also heard that Wu had told someone that a set of baby bones was worth 400 yuan, and he had taken it with him, as if he was trying to profit from it. The dead baby was Wu's nephew. If that is the case, his intentions are even more questionable. This is truly an outrageous incident.</p>

The other, Lu Chenglong, also denied the robbery. The police then escorted the two suspects to the Zhou family to be identified. Zhou Bingkun, the victim, identified Chen Mingxian as the robber, but Lu Chenglong was not present at the scene. After repeated questioning, Chen Axian confessed and revealed the names of several accomplices hiding in Shanghai. Captain Li has already sent detectives to Shanghai to arrest them.</p>

In addition to the Fengmen station in Jiaxing and Suzhou, there are six intermediate stations planned: Wanggangjing, Shengze, Pingwang, Beitan, Wujiang, and Yishan. Three large iron bridges will be built at Pingwang, Liling, and east of Baodai Bridge. The total cost of the bridges and roads is estimated to be over four million yuan, and the entire line is expected to be completed and open to traffic within two years.</p>

<p>The river near the Diaogiao and Huangniqiao areas outside the North Gate of the county has been silted up for years, making it impassable. The recent drought has made it impossible for boats to travel, disrupting transportation and causing water shortages. The Daqiao Township Office and merchants such as Chen Zhongying and Zhou Weichen, recognizing the severity of the situation, have raised funds and hired workers to dredge the river. The Huangniqiao section has already been completed, and the Diaogiao River section was dammed yesterday to begin pumping water. Work will begin today (the 18th). The total cost of the project is estimated to be over five hundred yuan.

<p>(Zhenjiang) Jiangnan counties suffered from a severe summer drought, with cracked fields and withered crops, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. Fortunately, officials and civilians worked together to draw water from rivers and lakes to irrigate the fields and replant drought-resistant crops in the hopes of salvaging what they could. Since autumn, the weather has been relatively favorable, with timely rainfall, and the land has become moist again. Farmers were happy, believing they could still salvage something. However, recently, there have been heavy downpours, often lasting all day. The rain was particularly heavy in the last two days, as if the Milky Way was pouring down, like a waterfall hanging in the air. The total rainfall in the past few days has been over a foot. Low-lying fields have become a vast expanse of water. Drought-resistant crops such as cotton, beans, buckwheat, wheat, and sweet potatoes cannot withstand excessive rain, which will severely damage the harvest. Even this meager harvest is unattainable, and the common people will truly have nothing to live on. Although the harvest in Jiangbei counties this year is still abundant, the heavy rain has caused the Yi and Huai rivers to rise rapidly, posing an imminent threat to the levees along the Yellow River, which is threatening to invade the old canal.</p>

<p>(Jiaxing) The Jiaxing County Government, concerned about the soaring rice prices and their impact on the livelihoods of the poor, ordered rice merchants to raise 3,000 yuan to purchase rice for price stabilization. The subsidized sales was originally scheduled to begin on September 6, but because it was difficult to collect the funds, it was postponed until the other day. Then the Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting to discuss measures to stabilize rice prices, and the following was decided: (1) Appoint people to investigate poor households inside and outside the city and in the four suburban areas to provide them with subsidized purchase certificates, with a ten-day investigation period. (2) The consumption rate for sales should not exceed 5%. (3) The rice sold at subsidized prices should be purchased from Hunan. (4) The sales location should be at the Lanxi Guild Hall.</p>

It is said that this measure has already been properly coordinated by the City Party Department and the Postal Workers' Union, so today's packages and letters will all have this commemorative stamp.</p>
<p>(City Party Department Issues Declaration to the Public) Declaration to the Public on the Third Anniversary of September 18th: Dear compatriots, today is the unprecedented September 18th National Humiliation Commemoration for our nation. Recalling this day three years ago, the Japanese imperialists, wielding their gunboat policy like a stroke of madness, began to invade our Northeast Shenyang. Within a morning, they seized more than a dozen cities such as Changchun and Yingkou. Within two months, they captured the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Then they invaded our Songhu, disturbed our Pingjin, occupied our Rehe, and established puppet organizations. Thus, more than four million square miles of our territory and more than thirty million of our compatriots were all under their iron hooves. Is this unprecedented and tragic national humiliation not a deep hatred and great insult to our entire nation? Since September 18th, on the part of our government, we have sought peace externally and examined national strength internally, not hesitating to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, first with appeals to the League of Nations, then with armed resistance. Although we have not been able to immediately return to the invaded land, we have inflicted a heavy blow on the brutal Japanese in spirit. On the part of our people, all are filled with righteous indignation. On the front lines, they organized volunteer armies, raised banners, and went to justice to resist the stubborn enemies. In the rear, they vigorously implemented boycott movements, causing a great blow to the brutal Japanese industry and commerce. What is regrettable is that not long after, the powerless League of Nations could not subdue the brutal Japanese, and our bodies of flesh and blood could not match the sharpness of their planes and guns, and our people's boycott movement also slackened over time. As a result, the brutal Japanese became even more unscrupulous, and the future consequences are truly unknown. Therefore, when we commemorate national humiliation today, we should learn from past mistakes, bury ourselves in hard work. First, we must know that if we want to control the fate of the brutal Japanese, there is nothing better than not buying Japanese goods, promoting domestic goods, and striving for thoroughness. Therefore, the boycott movement should continue to advance. Second, if we want to avenge national humiliation, we must first strengthen national power, and national defense construction is especially needed. Aviation is the key to national defense. Our compatriots must assist the government to complete the mission of saving the country through aviation. Third, the Red Bandits are a problem in our heart. To resist foreign aggression, we must first settle internal affairs. Our compatriots must first assist the government in completing the work of suppressing bandits in preparation for resisting Japan. In short, today, internal troubles and foreign invasions, the national crisis is no less than it was three years ago. Our compatriots should be aware that the country may be lost at any time, make the determination to rescue the dying and support the injured, embrace the spirit of lying on firewood and tasting gall, exert vigorous efforts, and work together. Only then can lost territory be recovered and national hatred avenged. I am willing to encourage this with my compatriots. Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>(General Li Du's Letter to the People) Datong News Agency reports that General Li Du, in view of the growing national crisis and the declining morale of the people, during this painful September 18th commemoration, yesterday issued a written letter to the people. The original text is copied below: (Painful and sad September 18th, three years have passed in a hurry. Recalling the beginning of the incident, the whole country was shaken, and enthusiastic people were running around calling for help in order to save the situation. There were also righteous armies, the indignation of the people, and the Japanese invaders confronted each other. At that time, compatriots at home and abroad raised funds to provide assistance, providing spiritual and material support. This is the expression of the people's morale, which is enough to comfort the Chinese nation. Today, the national crisis has not ended, and the disaster of the invaders is getting deeper. The so-called critical moment of survival is at hand. We must have a firm determination and make thorough preparations. We must strive to invigorate and seek to restore the nation. The future of the nation is almost certain. On the third week of September 18th, I would like to record a few words to encourage the people of the country.</p>
<p>(Notice from the First Special District Federation) The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city yesterday sent a letter to the branch associations in various districts, saying: Greetings, the territory of the four northeastern provinces has changed color, and we have endured humiliation for three years. Now that the three-week national humiliation period has arrived, all our countrymen should solemnly commemorate it. Please inform all member stores to fly flags at half-mast on the 18th to express sorrow, and to stop all entertainment for the whole day. At the same time, the branch associations should separately schedule time to convene commemorative meetings to publicize the shameful deeds of September 18th. This is to the branch association of District 口.</p>
<p>(Declaration to Compatriots from the National Goods Factory Federation) The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, in view of today's (September 18th) commemoration, specifically issued a declaration to the compatriots of the whole city, saying: Compatriots! Today is the third week of the (September 18th) commemoration. Three years ago today, Japan used artillery and airplanes to begin invading our four provinces in North China. What kind of feelings should we have for this painful memorial day? What kind of aspirations should we hold? Are we weak to the end? Are we just preparing to be subjugated slaves? Compatriots, wake up! Japan has already swallowed our four northeastern provinces and implemented its ambition to monopolize East Asia. Alas, our compatriots outside the customs are already living a life far worse than slaves. The title of subjugated slave will soon be added to our heads. Wake up, compatriots! In order to resist the brutality of the ambitious, in order to fight for the survival of the nation. But this painful fact has passed for three years. In these whole three years, what kind of achievements have we made in resisting? Three years ago, the people of the whole country seemed to have awakened unanimously. At that time, the national blood was boiling, and the courage was sufficient. Everyone held grand aspirations, shouted pleasing slogans, posted many radical slogans, organized volunteer armies, and joined dare-to-die teams. But what happened after that? The land outside the customs was occupied by others. The tragedy of (September 18th) has become a memorial in history. At this time, where have those enthusiastic compatriots gone? Alas, this kind of tiger-headed and snake-tailed movement proves that it is the inferiority of our Chinese nation. Compatriots, cheer up! Destroying the enemies in front of us will bring us a clear survival. For the sake of survival, we should strive forward. Compatriots, talking about saving the country with bare hands is our biggest drawback. We have learned lessons in three years. From now on, we should do things down-to-earth to save our dying nation. In recent years, according to customs reports, the number of imported goods is so alarming. Foreigners have already taken economic aggression measures to kill us. Compatriots, wake up quickly! Are our enemies just the neighboring Japanese who caused the (September 18th) tragedy? Our surroundings are already full of ambitious people who can destroy our country and exterminate our race. Their economic aggression is more powerful than guns. If we want to deal with his economic aggression, compatriots, we can only promote domestic goods. Promoting domestic goods is the basic work for us to save the country and survive. Increasing production is our only way out. It is also our only hope for survival. We should resist the conspiracy of economic aggression by the great powers, restore our due vitality, and then we will train our soldiers and recover our shameful (September 18th) lost land. This final victory belongs to our people. Compatriots, in order to fight for the survival of the Chinese nation, we should promote domestic goods together from today onwards. In order to resist the economic aggression of the great powers, we should use domestic goods from today onwards.</p>
<p>(Wang Delin's Anti-Japanese Battle Achievements) After the four northeastern provinces were invaded and occupied by the Japanese invaders, the destruction and trampling were meticulous. However, volunteer armies in various places still fought and fought with them from time to time. During the year, the period of green gauze tents was the most active. The General Headquarters of the Northeast Volunteer Army sent Adjutant Xu Yuanshun, who traveled south from Shanhaiguan, to report that the department had engaged in 40 or 50 large and small anti-Japanese battles between June, July and August. The greatest achievements are outlined below: (1) Wu Yicheng fought to the death in Luozigou. Wu Yicheng, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army, was brave and good at fighting and had a long-standing reputation. At the end of July, Wu led hundreds of troops to attack Luozigou in Dunhua. When it was captured, the Japanese and puppet troops gathered a large force and surrounded them. Wu desperately fought the trenches for several hours, but eventually it was difficult to defend due to the fierce artillery fire, so he broke through the encirclement and escaped. In this battle, Wu's department lost more than 100 officers and soldiers, and the enemy also suffered significant losses. (2) Kong Xianrong fought steadily and calmly at the front, and had both courage and strategy. He was known as Little Kongming. Recently, he has been running around on the north and south sides of the Middle East Road. Most of his direct departments are in the Mishan and Ning'an areas. Hengdaohezi, the Middle East Road, is the most important station in the middle section. In early August, Kong led his troops into the station twice, overturned his grain trucks, and forced the Japanese soldiers escorting the trucks to disarm, but he did not harm them. Therefore, the Japanese soldiers mostly felt his benevolence and feared his prestige. (3) Zhang Yuting showed his magical powers by destroying roads in Yimianpo. Zhang Yuting, the director of the department, is a blood-spirited and brave general. In recent years, he has been guerrillas with Japanese and puppet troops in the mountainous areas such as Dengshahe and Yimianpo in the western section of the Middle East Road. He has made remarkable achievements. Recently, he specializes in destroying railway traffic. Few eastbound bullet trains or grain trains passing through here are spared. In mid-August, on one occasion, in order to avoid the eyes and ears of the rebels, the Japanese army drove at night with a full load of ammunition and 100 police officers to protect it. However, when approaching a certain mountain in Yimianpo, the car was overturned again, and the ambush troops on both sides rose up and killed dozens of Japanese soldiers. His methods were so quick that they shocked the Japanese. Recently, Yi Army was suspected of being instigated by the Soviet Russia, or even by the Communist Party, which is nothing more than being paranoid.</p>
<p>(Anti-Japanese Heroes Escaped Danger and Returned South) Peace News Agency Special Report, Tian Zhongyi, a native of Changzhou, Jiangsu, was a teacher at Peizi Middle School in Shenyang, Northeast. During the (September 18th) campaign, he hated the barbarity of the brutal Japanese and could not bear the fall of the territory. He immediately joined Xiaobailong's department and served as the benevolence team. Xiaobailong's department was divided into three teams: wisdom, benevolence, and courage. The volunteer army fought against the Japanese Kou many times, taking the lead and killing countless enemies. Unfortunately, during the plot to seize Shenyang City last winter, he was captured by the Japanese army and suffered severe torture. The Japanese were inhumane and used sharp small knives to cut Tian's pupils into a cross shape. Then, they injected alkali into the eye sockets, causing Tian's eyes to become blind instantly. Fortunately, this spring, our volunteer army rescued Tian from danger. After escaping danger, Tian endured hardship and begged for food along the way to return south. He arrived in Ningbo on the 16th of this month and planned to take a bus to the Hangzhou Security Office to find his brother, who was a company commander in a certain regiment of the Security Team. Because he had no money, he wandered around the Yong Station. Later, a certain passenger gave him a third-class ticket, and Tian took the train leaving Yong for Hangzhou at 1:55 p.m. The Yong reporter of the Peace News Agency, because it was reported that Xiaobailong had lost his honor and surrendered to the enemy, once asked Tian about this matter. According to Tian, Xiaobailong's department was scattered in all directions, and there were still more than 20,000 people. Xiaobailong himself, due to insufficient support, temporarily hid in the mountains and forests. The rumors of his loss of honor were by enemies and were by no means true.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Shanghai Port Authority Ordered Automatic Dredger from Germany <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Launching Ceremony at German Bank on the 15th</p>
<p>It Can Sail to China in March Next Year</p>
<p>Wang Jingshun, secretary of the Shanghai Port Authority, told a reporter from the East China News Agency that foreign ocean-going ships must pass through the East China Sea to enter the Wusongkou and the Huangpu River. Between the East China Sea and the Huangpu River, there is a place called Shentan. The water in this shoal is shallow, and all larger ships must wait for high tide before they can enter the port. If there is no high tide, they will anchor immediately. Director Song Ziliang of this bureau, in order to</p>
<p>Dredge the Shoal to Facilitate Traffic, Ordered an Automatic Dredger from the Danzig Shipyard in Germany. The ship is named (Construction). This ship is the largest dredger in the world.</p>
<p>The Contract for Ordering this Ship was Signed in Germany last winter after being witnessed by our Minister to Germany, Liu Wendao. After Minister Liu sent the contract to China for review, the keel was laid in the Danzig Shipyard. The bureau specifically sent Engineer Smith of the Dredging Department and Assistant Engineer Zhu Chongxi to the factory to supervise the construction. The external hull of the ship has been completed. Yesterday, the Port Authority received a telegram from our Minister to Germany, Liu Chongjie, stating that the (Construction) dredger, etc., were in the Danzig Shipyard dock</p>
<p>Hold a Launching Ceremony at 2:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month. Mrs. Liu, wife of the Minister, broke the bottle, and all members of the Chinese Embassy in Germany attended the ceremony. The director of the shipyard delivered a speech, and Minister Liu gave a reply (the text is omitted). They raised champagne to celebrate the completion. The cost of this ship is £1,500,800. This amount must be</p>
<p>Pay in Installments until the entire ship is completed and sailed to China. After the test run matches the signed contract and is deemed satisfactory, the entire cost will be paid off. If the dredging is less than eight-tenths of the original contract, it can be returned in full. According to Mr. Wang, the ship is automatic. While sailing, it dredges itself. Every ten hours, it can dredge 30,000 tons of mud. After the mud is full, there is also machinery that can automatically release it. The construction is very ingenious. The ship is 360 feet long, 60 feet wide, and the draft is 18 feet when fully loaded. The entire project is expected to be completed in about February next year, and the two engineers of this bureau who were sent to Germany to supervise the construction will</p>
<p>Supervise the Arrival in China in March. After arriving in China and the test run is successful, it will be officially accepted and sailed to the Shentan waters of the Yangtze River in the East China Sea to start dredging work. If the results are good, another ship will be added to the factory so that both parties can operate one ship at a time.</p>
<h3 id="e139">China Merchants Bureau Opens Overseas Shipping Routes <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Pooan Steamer to Set Sail for Little Luzon</p>
<p>Regular Service to Begin in November</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau has commissioned the construction of four new seagoing vessels in England: the Haiyuan, which left England on the 14th of this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on October 19th; the Haiheng, scheduled for November; and the Haizhen and Haili, both expected to arrive in December. The Bureau has decided on the routes for these four new ships, with three to operate on the Qingdao-Shanghai and Swatow-Hong Kong-Guangdong lines, and the other to sail the Shanghai-Qingdao-Yantai-Tianjin northern route. With these four ships in service, the number of sailings between Shanghai and Qingdao will be abundant. The existing Pooan steamer will then be difficult to continue on that route. The Bureau has therefore resolved to redeploy the Pooan to overseas routes, in order to develop shipping in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>(Designated Special Vessel) To develop shipping to the South Seas Islands with Chinese vessels, the Bureau has conducted a thorough investigation. Between Xiamen and Little Luzon, there are over 100,000 overseas Chinese traveling each year. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines have repeatedly requested that the China Merchants Bureau dispatch ships to operate on this route, in order to reclaim commercial interests. The Bureau has now decided to reassign the Pooan steamer to the Xiamen-Philippines route, as its passenger capacity makes it ideal for this service. After several days of discussion, the business department has already begun planning the procedures for commencing service, and projecting the revenue and expenditure of the business.</p>
<p>(Overseas Compatriots Welcome) Many of the overseas Chinese in Manila and other places are natives of Fujian and Guangdong. Every year, over a thousand people travel between these places and the homeland, taking ships from Xiamen. Currently, the only passenger ship operating on this route is the British Taikoo Company's Anqing, with a displacement of over 3,400 tons. Fares are very high and business is booming, with first-class cabins costing one hundred yuan, second-class eighty-two yuan, and third-class over sixty yuan. Even steerage costs more than thirty yuan. Each year, overseas Chinese money leaks into foreign ships to the tune of hundreds of thousands of yuan. They have repeatedly requested that the China Merchants Bureau send ships to operate this service, both to relieve the oppression of overseas Chinese and to reclaim commercial interests. Now, upon hearing that the Pooan steamer will open a Xiamen-Philippines service, overseas Chinese in Manila have expressed extreme welcome, and those in the Philippines are willing to assist with all their strength. The Pooan steamer, once preparations are complete, is scheduled to officially begin service in early November.</p>

<p>Cheng Hu's Entire Family Fortunately Escapes</p>
<p>In Gaojia Alley, West of Yangjing Town in Pudong, there are three courtyards of old houses facing west, all inhabited by the Gao family. It is said that their ancestors were officials in the Ming Dynasty, and the house has been built for three hundred years, so it is extremely dilapidated. In recent days, due to the heavy rain, the walls, pillars, and roofs are all soaked in rainwater, and the seven bays of the building are unable to bear the pressure and are gradually becoming difficult to support. At 4:10 PM yesterday, a cracking sound was heard. The eight or nine families living in these seven old houses were startled and fled at the same time. Then, Gao Xu, the wife of the house owner Gao Baochun, and Gao Yu, the wife of Gao Miaogen, seeing that the house was unlikely to collapse for a while, risked entering to retrieve important objects. Suddenly, a sharp cracking sound was heard, and the seven bungalows completely collapsed. Xu and Yu were unable to escape and were crushed under the tiles. The nearby police station immediately reported to the third district and third year, and Director Jiang ordered the police to overturn the collapsed house and rescue the two women. Xu was found to be bleeding from the head, and Yu was found to have injured her abdomen. It was determined that Xu was old and weak and could not last long, while Yu was young and strong, but her injuries were serious. They were immediately ordered to be sent to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. A report was also submitted to the Public Security Bureau for verification. Before the collapse of the house, a strange thing happened. It is said that a Chongming native named Cheng Hu, who rented a house in the house, had a family of seven, old and young. Yesterday morning, Cheng Hu's wife suddenly saw the paper statue of the kitchen god being blown by the wind, with its face facing inward, which she thought was unlucky. Therefore, in the morning, the whole family moved to No. 8 Youfang Alley in the east. Unexpectedly, the house collapsed that afternoon, so Cheng Hu's family all raised their hands to celebrate.</p>

<p>Hu Claims His Wife Fled Privately</p>
<p>The Wife Cries Upon Hearing This</p>
<p>Hu Bachou, an accountant at the Huaxin Co., Ltd. at No. 559 Nanjing Road, is from Panyu, Guangdong. In June of the 19th year of the Republic, he married a woman from the same township, Ma Xuehua. At that time, Ma was already thirty-nine years old. Since she lost her father early and had no brothers or sisters, she and her mother depended on each other for survival. Therefore, when they got engaged, she made it clear that she still had to live with her old mother after marriage, so that her mother would not have to worry about being cold or hungry. Hu also agreed readily and said that he would never abandon her. Commemorating the September 18th Incident, Buy One Get One Free Nine Star Milky White Cod Liver Oil. Released by Shanghai Zhongxi Pharmacy. Today's Autumn Season Big Discount Big Giveaway</p>
<p>Until the first month of this year, Hu suddenly, on the grounds that his mother-in-law was old and had been helping to take care of the household and was overworked, sent her back to her original home in Guangdong. At that time, Ma thought that Hu was acting out of good intentions, but she was concerned that Shanghai and Guangdong were far apart, and it would be lonely for the old woman to return alone. So, she persuaded Hu to prepare more travel expenses and let her accompany her mother back home. Hu initially had no objections. Ma packed her luggage, took her three-year-old child, and went to Guangdong with her mother on the Suiyang steamer. Unexpectedly, after Ma and others left, Hu's attitude suddenly changed. He completely broke his previous promises. Not only did he not send money as promised to maintain the livelihood of their mother and daughter, but he also claimed that Ma had taken her clothes and secretly fled with her husband. Therefore, Ma repeatedly sent letters urging him to send money, but he ignored them all. Upon hearing the news in Guangdong, she became ill with anger. On the 16th of last month, after recovering from her illness, she returned to Shanghai with her old mother and stayed at the Taian Inn. She then sent a tea boy to ask Hu to go to the inn to pay for her travel expenses and to repay old debts, but Hu sternly refused and treated Ma as a stranger. Ma then knew that Hu was definitely malicious in abandoning her. She immediately took her mother and child and moved elsewhere. On one hand, she hired lawyer Zhu Honglie to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Local Court against Hu, requesting that he be punished for abandonment in accordance with Article 309 of the Criminal Law, and filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that the defendant pay alimony of three thousand yuan at once. Yesterday afternoon, judge Ye opened a court session. The plaintiff Ma Xuehua explained the circumstances of her marriage to Hu and her return to Shanghai from Guangdong. Hu claimed that the plaintiff had fled to Guangdong privately. Ma cried upon hearing this and spoke in her Guangdong dialect. Judge Ye held that the statements of both parties in this case were contradictory and needed to be investigated further, and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>

<p>The Culprit Escaped and Could Not be Found</p>
<p>There are two trade unions, old and new, in the carpentry workshop of the Rui Rong Iron Factory on Yangshupu Road. The two sides had a dispute a few days ago, and then refused to give in to each other and fought each other. As a result, Liang Pei, a 40-year-old Guangdong member of the old union, and Yu Xiangchen, Zhang and other three members of the new union were beaten and injured. They were sent to Shengxin Hospital for treatment. Liang was the most seriously injured, and the rescue was ineffective, and he died soon after. Yu and Chen were slightly bandaged by the doctor and then left the hospital for treatment. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, the Yulin Road Police Station ordered detectives to investigate. The perpetrators on both sides had fled upon hearing the news and could not be arrested. Therefore, Liang's body was moved to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, came to the morgue to identify the body. After the detectives reported the investigation process, Guo determined that the deceased Liang Pei, male, died from head injuries sustained during his lifetime.

<p>Ke Shengcang, a physician of internal and surgical national medicine, resided at No. 30 Xiangguang Lane, East Xihuade Road, Hongkou. In February of this year, he was accused by Feng Heqing of misusing medicine when he treated Feng's son, Xiangguang (nine years old). First, Feng demanded compensation for medical expenses and asked a lawyer to send a letter to Ke. Then, Dr. Wang negotiated a settlement with Ke, but Dr. Ke refused, saying that the prescription he prescribed was not inappropriate for the condition. Therefore, in April, Feng filed a complaint with the First Court of the Shanghai Special District. The criminal court judge ordered Bao Xun to review the case and send the prescription opened by Dr. Ke to the Shanghai National Medical Association and the Shenzhou Medical Association for review. Everyone said that the prescription was not inappropriate for the condition, and the court ruled that Ke Shengcang was not guilty. Feng Heqing then appealed to the collegial panel of the First Court of the Jiangsu Shanghai Special District. Chief Judge Qian Hongye ruled on July 11 that Feng's appeal was not legitimate because it was an appeal to the third instance. The appeal was rejected immediately. According to Article 397, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, if one is not satisfied with the ruling, one may appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court within five days after the service of the ruling. It is now reported that Feng had filed an appeal and was rejected again. Ke, on the other hand, originally intended to countersue Feng Heqing in court for defamation, but was dissuaded by friends. Then this case can be concluded from now on.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, the Second Squad of the Water Patrol of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau received a report from Police Chief Wang Mingnian of the Caojiadu Police Station. On the morning of the 16th of this month, police officers Xie Changsheng and Yu Houde were patrolling the river surface of the Gongyi Yarn Factory in that area, and coal boat boss Chen Genfu reported that he was transporting 55 tons of coal from Mitsui Yangxing, 20 tons of which were handed over to Edison Bulb Factory. Later, it stopped due to rain. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 AM at night, seven or eight people boarded the boat to steal coal. Not only did the thieves not listen to the obstruction, but they also threw the coal indiscriminately, hitting the heads of boatmen Cai Xingsheng and Guo Sanlang, causing them to bleed profusely. After calling for help, they all fell into the water and escaped. Now, a small boat together with evidence of coal has been sent for investigation. At that time, a man named Yan Ligui claimed that Yan Lisan was his old man. That night, Cheng Hongde and Xie Liming came to my house and asked me and Wang Youfu He Xiaozhou to go and collect coal for one dollar per basket. A total of three baskets were bought. Because the boss Chen Genfu asked them for six cents of silver owed, the two sides fought each other. Now Yan Lisan and Wang Youfu have both been knocked into the water by them and their whereabouts are unknown. I heard the news and came to ask for an investigation, etc. Chen Genfu, the injured Cai Xingsheng and Guo Sanlang, and Yan Ligui, a total of four people, were presented together with the evidence and asked for verification. Inspector Xu then interrogated Chen Genfu, who was 42 years old and from Chongming. Boat boss Cai Xingsheng said he was 52 years old and Guo Sanlang said he was 36 years old. They were all from the same hometown as Chen. Yan Ligui, 34 years old, from Qingjiang, who lived in Tanjiadu and worked as a cook, and the rest of the words were roughly the same as above. After Inspector Xu verified the confession, he determined that the case involved a criminal matter, and that the corpse had been found by evening, so he ordered that it be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation, and ordered the local police to report it to the court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Zhao Xilin, a native of Changzhou, formerly worked as a detective in the local Public Security Bureau. In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], he came to Shanghai and worked as an inspector at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. One morning in August of that year, around 6:00 AM, while passing near the factory, he was shot and wounded by an enemy in an attempt on his life. He was shot again in the same manner, and this time the bullet hit a vital spot, causing his death. The police arrested two suspects, Fang Renzhao and Wu Zhiying, both from Changzhou, and sent them to the First Special Court for preliminary hearing. Due to insufficient evidence, they were declared innocent. The police appealed, but the High Court sentenced them to life imprisonment. Fang and others hired lawyers and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back for retrial. The result was still the same as the original trial. Recently, the police arrested Ren Haoming, also from Changzhou. Investigation revealed that he was involved in the initial attempted murder of Zhao Xilin. He was sent to the court, but due to insufficient evidence, he was acquitted. However, Ren had committed many crimes in his hometown, so he was temporarily detained in the civil detention center to await further action. Yesterday, Zhou Yiwen, a bailiff from Wujin County, delivered an official letter and confession from the suspect to the Third Criminal Court, stating that Ren had committed robbery and kidnapping in his hometown in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], and that Fang and Wu were also involved. The question was whether they could be transferred together. Mr. Li, a lawyer from the Bureau of Public Works, stated that there was no problem with Ren Haoming, but for Fang and Wu, sufficient evidence must be presented in accordance with the agreement before they could be transferred. They would be temporarily held in the detention center. Judge Wu Zehan informed Bailiff Zhou of this, and then ordered that Ren Haoming be handed over to the police from Wujin County. Fang and Wu were returned to custody.</p>

They arrested the man and took him and the evidence back to the station. Chief Zhu proposed interrogating him. The man identified himself as Liu Quanming, 27 years old, from Nanjing. His answers were vague. Since the matter involved illegal arms trafficking, he was ordered to prepare a document and send him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

They arrested Zhang and took him, along with the guns and bullets, to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him under Article 200 of the Criminal Code for endangering public safety and Article 1 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms. He stated that the defendant had confessed at the police station that on the 14th of this month, he met his friend Chen Qiaosheng at a teahouse on Shandong Road and agreed to go to Caojiadu on Jessfield Road to collect a debt at 10:00 AM on the 15th. He met Chen on Fujian Road and then boarded a Route 16 trolleybus. When they passed Macgregor Road, Chen quickly threw the handguns under the seat and went to the first-class compartment. After being searched by the Chinese and Western officers, he got off the trolleybus and fled. The defendant tried to escape, but it was too late. Chen is still at large. He requested an extension. Judge Liu briefly questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>First Special Court Summoned for Further Questioning Yesterday</p>
<p>The police station on Avenue Foch received a report from the Japanese police of the Japanese Consulate at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, stating that red pills were being manufactured in a printing shop opened by a Japanese man, Ike Daa, at No. 59 Baole'an Road. They requested assistance in the arrest. The police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the First Special District Court to obtain a search warrant and secretly went to arrest him. The mastermind, Japanese man Ike Daa, had already heard the news and fled without a trace. They saw three Chinese men working inside. Hang Xiqing, a native of Ningbo, jumped out of the window on the upper floor and injured his foot. He was arrested, along with Wang A'san from Wuxi, Zhang A'san from Shanghai, and the molds, machines, and raw materials for making red pills. The injured Hang was taken to the police hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Wang and Zhang were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Bureau of Public Works lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the facts and said that the mastermind, Japanese man Ike Daa, could not be found. The Chinese and Western detectives waited there until midnight and arrested a Japanese man named Gai Li, who was sent to the Japanese Consulate for questioning. The seized red pill materials were handed over to the Bureau of Public Works doctor for testing. He requested an extension for this case. Wang A'san confessed that the house was rented by Japanese man Ike Daa. There were two Japanese men in total. He was paid eight yuan a month to help mix the medicine and make pills. The two Japanese men were manufacturing in the room. Hang Xiqing could enter. Zhang A'san's confession was similar. Judge Xiao Xie ordered them to be detained for further investigation in two days.</p>

<p>Shareholders Spoil the Fun, Manager's Conduct is Outrageous</p>
<p>Released on Bail During the Honeymoon Period; Case Adjourned for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Mei Shiwei (号 Jingfang), the 35-year-old manager of the Xinhua Silk Weaving Factory at 157 Route Conty, French Concession, is a native of Tiantai, Zhejiang Province. As a shareholder and manager, he joined with four and a half shares (valued at 100 yuan each) in the 15th year of the Republic. Despite only earning a salary of dozens of yuan per month, he lived lavishly and dressed extravagantly, arousing the suspicion of other shareholders. Recently, Mei, feeling lonely as his wife was in the countryside, was introduced to a woman in Shanghai and decided to take her as a concubine. He chose the Great World South Shou Dali Chun Shaoxing Restaurant as the venue for the wedding ceremony on the 15th and emptied the rooms upstairs in the factory, renovating them to serve as the new bridal chamber. This further aroused the attention of the shareholders. Shareholder Xu Jinfang (38 years old, from Tiantai) carefully examined Mei's account books over the years and discovered that Mei had embezzled over 1,700 yuan by the end of last year. This year, from the beginning to the present, he had secretly misappropriated another 1,100 yuan. Furthermore, a set of redwood furniture belonging to the factory had been moved out by Mei without permission, and its whereabouts were unknown. Xu reported this to the French police and requested an investigation. Detective Qian Yumin and officer Yin Baoke investigated and confirmed the facts. They went to arrest Mei on the morning of the 15th, on the auspicious day of his wedding. The wedding guests had arrived, but to their dismay, the groom was arrested, and the guests scattered. The detectives took the guest list (which had already recorded eleven wedding gifts) and more than ten account books from the factory as evidence to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special Court, where Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Division. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case and requested a one-week extension to thoroughly investigate the case. Defendant's lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that the defendant was in the midst of his honeymoon and requested to be released on bail. The court ordered the case to be adjourned to the 21st for further investigation. The defendant was required to provide a surety of 3,000 yuan, or he would be detained.</p>

<p>This time, planning to return to Japan to purchase goods, he traveled with his colleague, Mr. Raloff from Australia, by ship from Australia. During the journey to Manila, he suddenly met a beautiful Filipino woman and fell in love at first sight. Later, they confided in each other on the ship. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong and then Shanghai, Matsumoto was already infatuated with the woman. Upon arrival, he went ashore with her and dined at a restaurant on Sima Road. Unexpectedly, the woman suddenly disappeared. Matsumoto returned to the ship to look for her, but suddenly felt unwell, confused, and spoke incoherently. His belongings were all gone. Fortunately, his companion, Mr. Raloff, took care of him. When the ship arrived in Kobe, he was rushed to the neurology department of Osaka Hospital for treatment. However, after many days, he remained unconscious. After several blood tests, the hospital found no traces of injury, cerebral hemorrhage, or meningitis. It was an unbelievable case of poisoning. It is likely that he was given a strong narcotic when he went to the restaurant with the woman. This was the result of his pursuit of beauty, a self-inflicted disaster.</p>

<p>French Police Inspector Robert (transliteration) received a tip the night before last that someone was privately setting up a red pill manufacturing den in the pavilion room on the third floor of No. 16, De Xing Lane, 150 Balizhuang Street, specializing in selling to Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places, making huge profits. He immediately took Inspector Li Yaolong, detectives Zhang Daorong, Bao Tang Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshi, and others to secretly search the address without making a sound. They arrested the boss, Chen Gencai (21 years old, Shanghai native, residing at the address), Zhao A'liu (26 years old, Shanghai native, residing at No. 164, Mingde Lane, Houxin Street), employees Yang Liansheng (47 years old, Nanjing native), Xue Rongsheng (22 years old, Changzhou native), and Chen A'fu (55 years old, Shanghai native, all three residing at the den). They seized 25 packs of red pills, each pack containing 1,000 pills, totaling 25,000 pills, four ovens, one sieve, one pill-making board, one pill-cutting board, one lamp, one metal clamp, and one rope. They were taken to the police station, and yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Judge Wu Fanglian interrogated them. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the facts and requested an extension for investigation, requesting the defendants be detained pending investigation and prosecution. Detective Liu Jinrong reported the process of the arrest and presented the red pills as evidence. After the court verified the report and briefly questioned the defendants, they were ordered to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Intervening in a Dispute Over a Copper Coin, Humiliating a Thug</p>
<p>Gathering a Crowd for Revenge, One Bullet Fatal</p>
<p>Gao Anjun, a native of Shandong, 42 years old, formerly worked as a patrolman in the French police, assigned to the transportation department. He resigned due to failing eyesight. He lived with his wife, Gao Hu (40 years old, Anhui native), in the apartment above the garage at No. 183 Route Ladu, French Concession. A week ago, someone named Jia went to the Cheng Shuntai tobacco and paper shop opened by a woman, Cheng Gu, at No. 132 Rue Conty and bought a pack of cigarettes. He gave a two-jiao coin, and there was a dispute over the exchange rate of 480 wen versus 470 wen, a difference of one copper coin. Gao happened to pass by the shop and intervened, helping the shop and subduing Jia. After being dispersed by others, Jia left, humiliated and dissatisfied. Yesterday at 12:20 PM, he gathered several thugs to seek revenge on Gao. Gao was at home and resisted. Jia pulled out a handgun and fired at Gao, hitting Gao's left rib and exiting through his back. Gao fell to the ground, injured. The perpetrators fled. Patrolmen reported this to the police station on Rue Massenet. Gao was taken to Guangci Hospital, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 4:15 PM. The hospital notified the police, and Detective Zhang Chunsheng was dispatched to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy, pending notification to the Second Special Court for inspection today. The Western police chief ordered the detectives to investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Yi Qingzhi Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Yi Qingzhi, 24 years old, from Beidongtai, was a night soil collector residing at No. 96, Dafu Lane, inside Dadongmen. Recently, for some unknown reason, he had a deep feud with his colleagues and fellow townsmen Wang Liubao (20 years old) and Xu Renyou (31 years old). Yesterday at around 3:00 PM, Yi went out and passed the entrance of Pinhua Fang on Anren Street inside Xiaodongmen. He was suddenly ambushed by Wang and Xu, who were lying in wait. They grabbed him and stabbed him repeatedly with three-inch knives. Yi was caught off guard and was stabbed more than ten times in the head, arms, legs, abdomen, and scrotum. Blood spurted from the wounds, and he fell to the ground, unconscious. Wang and Xu were covered in blood and tried to abandon the murder weapons and flee. Wu Guangzhen, a guard from the 24th post, heard the commotion and rushed over, arresting the two assailants and taking them, along with the two murder weapons, to the Second Precinct of the First District. Liu, the station chief, questioned them. Wang Liubao confessed that he lived at No. 82, Tiandeng Lane, Xiaonanmen. Yi, disregarding their relationship as colleagues and fellow townsmen, had extorted 15 yuan from his father on the pretext of being from Xiaojiangyin, and this was the reason for the attack. Xu Renyou's confession was the same as Wang's. Because the matter involved assault, they were ordered to prepare a document and send them to the police bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Gasoline Leaks From Container on Rickshaw,</p>
<p>Flames Ignite, Burns Prove Fatal</p>
<p>An elderly woman, Qi Qian, 66 years old, from Wuxi, came to Shanghai last month to visit her daughter, who was married to a Mr. Xu and lived at No. 4 Caojiadu. The old woman unexpectedly fell ill at her son-in-law's house. Her son, Qi Shengmao, a farmer in Wuxi, was too busy to come to Shanghai, so he sent his 18-year-old daughter to Shanghai to see her grandmother and bring medicine. Recently, the old woman's illness gradually improved, and she decided to return home. On the evening of the 13th of this month, she said goodbye to her daughter and son-in-law and hired a rickshaw with her granddaughter to go to the North Railway Station to take the train back to Wuxi. On the way, the stopper of a gasoline bottle (presumably for a primus stove) stored in a basket on the rickshaw came loose. The basket shook as the rickshaw puller ran, causing the bottle to tip over and leak gasoline. Some of the gasoline dripped onto the rickshaw lamp, causing a sudden burst of flames. The old woman's granddaughter jumped off the rickshaw and was unharmed. The old woman, due to her age and slowness, was caught in the flames. Her clothes and body were burned. The rickshaw puller stopped the rickshaw and extinguished the flames, but the old woman had already been severely burned. The Jing'an Temple police station was notified and sent Detective Qian Xianting to take the injured woman to Guangren Hospital for treatment. However, the elderly woman, having just recovered from an illness, was unable to survive the ordeal. She died from her injuries the day before yesterday. The police sent Detective Qian to take the body to the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo from the First Special District Court arrived at the morgue to examine the body and inquire about the incident. He ordered her son, Qi Shengmao, to sign a statement and take the body back for burial. The old woman ultimately died in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Exquisite Fabrics, Well-Organized Layout</p>
<p>Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, located on Lu Jiabang Sanguantang Road in Nanshi, was established by Yan Guangdi in his early years. It has now been around for fourteen years, with gradual expansion. Since the addition of the dyeing department last year, it has been able to weave and process by itself, and the products have become more and more exquisite, and the business has become very prosperous. Yesterday, Chen Binghui and others, standing committee members of the Shanghai Citizens' Advocacy Association for Domestic Goods, together with Zhu Wenqi and others from the Silk Light Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, drove to visit. After arriving at the factory, they were received by Manager Yan Guangdi and Factory Director Zhang Yunqi. The factory covers an area of ​​more than ten mu and has more than seventy new-style factory buildings with ample light and a large scale. Mr. Yan led them to visit the weaving department, which is divided into spinning, warping, and weaving departments. It was found that most of the yarns used were domestic products, except for a few fine yarns purchased from British and American firms. There were a total of 284 looms, all new automatic iron machines. Each female worker can manage two looms, divided into day and night shifts, and can weave more than 420 pieces of cloth. Products such as crepe de chine, floral serge, and plain twill are exceptionally beautiful. Then, Chief Gong Shiliang of the finishing department led them to visit the finishing department. The department is divided into mercerizing, dyeing, singeing, tentering, and calendering departments, each with a foreman to supervise the workers in their respective tasks. The workers were unusually energetic. The finished fabrics were piled up in two rooms, one for self-made products and the other for dyeing on behalf of customers. The layout was well-organized and orderly. Director Gong was highly skilled in finishing and dyeing techniques, and his management of the workers was also quite appropriate. The visitors were satisfied. Later, they visited the napping room, which was full of flannel blanks. These flannel blanks were ordered from various cloth factories in Jiangyin and Huaxian in the interior. The woven stripes were extremely unique. After napping, they became even more beautiful. The factory's products are sold well in Guangdong, Fujian, and the Yangtze River provinces, especially in North China. All the representatives praised it as the most perfect domestic goods factory. After the visit, it was already five o'clock, and they all left.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Freight Training by the Two Railway Bureaus Commences Yesterday <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The freight training course organized by the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai), Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railway Administration commenced its first session yesterday (the 17th). The venue was the night school classroom of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at Tianhouguan Bridge. Around 9 a.m., representatives from various firms and factories arrived in the rain, totaling about forty people. First, Mr. Wu Shaozeng, the Deputy Director of the Railway Administration, delivered a speech, which lasted for half an hour. After a ten-minute break, Mr. Liu Dingxin, the Deputy Chief of the Traffic Department of the Railway Administration, instructed on the methods and key points of the group visits. Then, the training commenced according to the scheduled program. The main points of Deputy Director Wu's speech are recorded below. Economic relations in modern society can be considered extremely intricate, but in general, they are essentially</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>the relationship between (supply) and (demand). When supply and demand are appropriately balanced, society is peaceful. When supply and demand are imbalanced, whether supply exceeds demand or demand exceeds supply, society experiences panic. How can we achieve an appropriate balance between supply and demand? The most crucial factor is transportation. Because producers must have convenient transportation to move their goods out, and sellers must have convenient transportation to market their goods and reach consumers. Therefore, to adjust the relationship between supply and demand, producers, transporters, and sellers must cooperate fully and closely. Railways are large-scale transportation organizations. For both transportation and sales, they are as closely linked as arms and cannot be separated. Therefore, our railway, in its role as a transporter, has repeatedly discussed cooperation methods with various industrial and commercial sectors. As a result, we have established a general outline for cooperation between production, transportation, and sales along the railway lines, serving as a basis for implementation. Among the cooperative matters to be undertaken by our railway, one item is: (assigning personnel to guide or handle freight procedures in areas with significant production and sales of goods). Regarding handling freight procedures, our railway has already established business offices at Jing'an Temple Road, Shiliupu (Sixteen Pups) in Shanghai, and Taiping Road in Nanjing to undertake this work. Regarding guiding freight procedures, although our railway has published regulations for everyone's reference, the sequence of procedures and the calculation of freight, especially the responsibilities of freight transport, are relatively complex, which may not be easily understood by everyone. Therefore, we have specially invited you all here for the traffic personnel to explain to you, so that you can fully understand and eliminate any misunderstandings. In addition to verbally explaining the freight procedures, we will also accompany you to visit the Shanghai North Station and the MacKen Road Station to gain a</p>
<p>clear understanding from firsthand observation. This can be said to be the first step, and an important step, in the cooperation between production, transportation, and sales. As for our railway's further facilities to assist merchants in handling freight, we plan to actively promote the following main points: (A) Adding business offices in the locations of major stations to facilitate merchants' contact; (B) Establishing freight agencies in the interior to serve as branch offices of the business offices, providing full convenience for the transport of goods in and out of the interior; (C) Starting from next year, implementing the "business officeization" of all stations along the line, i.e., entrusting each station to handle the main work performed by the business offices. The purpose of this is to make the organization of our railway's freight transport system like the body commanding the arms, and the arms commanding the fingers, with a consistent system, achieving lively results. It is also hoped that cooperation between production, sales, and transportation can therefore be further realized from ideals to gradual reality. Next, let me talk about our future hopes. In the United States, there is something called a Traffic Club, which is a joint organization of shippers and carriers. If shippers have unclear points or difficulties, they can ask carriers to explain or help. Conversely, if carriers need the assistance of shippers, they can also discuss it. This kind of organization is truly the best method of cooperation. In the United States, there is also something called a Shippers Advisory Board,</p>
<p>which is entirely organized by shippers. Whenever there are issues of dissatisfaction with transportation organizations or hopes for improvement, the committee will jointly study and propose opinions to the transportation organizations. This kind of method, which can eliminate misunderstandings between the two parties, is also the best example of cooperation. This time, our railway's invitation to merchants to explain freight procedures, although it does not have the formal organization like that in the United States, also contains a part of the same function. It is hoped that in addition to studying freight procedures, everyone will raise questions and contribute opinions as much as possible in order to jointly improve transportation services. This would be most fortunate. That concludes my speech.</p>

<p>Modern Bookstore Gives Away September 18th Blood and Tears Commemorative Items. On the night of September 18th, 1931 (the 20th year of the Republic), with a thunderclap, the Japanese army occupied Shenyang. Before long, all three northeastern provinces were looted, creating an unprecedented national humiliation for our country on September 18th. Three years have passed, and not only have the lost territories not been recovered, but Yuguan and Rehe have successively fallen, and North China and Ximeng are in imminent danger. If the country's affairs have reached this point and we do not rise up to seek survival, what are we waiting for? The Modern Bookstore has published a book of Northeastern War Shadows from the events of that time. All those who purchase the book version of the book for one yuan or more today will receive a free copy to mark the anniversary. According to the book's Northeastern War Shadows, the materials are extremely valuable. Making it a commemorative item for the September 18th Incident is also of great significance. The bookstore is currently in its autumn discount period, with books selling for only 60% of the original price. Purchasers will not only enjoy the discount but also receive this free gift. Why not? However, the commemorative gift is limited to today only, making it a rare opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e187">My Questions Regarding Governor Clementi's Speech at the British Malaya Society (Introduction) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since Sir Clementi, after resigning as Governor of Hong Kong, took office as Governor of Singapore and High Commissioner of the Malay States in May 1929, his policy measures during the five years, in broad terms, include increasing national defense funds, decentralization, customs union, banning the Chinese Kuomintang, using Malay as the basis of education, promoting rice cultivation, rescuing rubber and tin, local industrialization, etc. His grand plans and ambitions, glaring at the Straits, the gains and losses of various policies, and their future impact are directly related to the political, military, and economic interests of the British colony. We do not need to overstep our authority to worry about it. Moreover, Sir Clementi, with his subjective views, before his resignation was approved, boasted of his achievements in governing Malaya on the platform of the United Kingdom, precisely to win public opinion in his country, which is not something we Chinese can interfere with. Only the matter of banning the activities of the Chinese Kuomintang is too far from the facts in his speech. We feel like a bone stuck in our throat on this issue and have wanted to say something about it for a long time. The authorities have not announced the reasons for the ban, and Singapore in the Straits Settlements is the hub of the three "S" lines. The British Empire regards it as an advanced important town to cope with the situation in the Pacific Ocean. More than 1.7 million overseas Chinese reside locally and in the Malay Federation, reclaiming wasteland and cultivating, prospering the land, with a long history and the most meritorious achievements. The intelligent British authorities should have no reason to discriminate against or despise them. At this time when the crisis in the Far East is becoming more apparent, Mr. Clementi received an important mission from the British Emperor, so we, based on the belief of coexistence and common prosperity, endured it and were unable to make a sudden discussion. Recently, Mr. Clementi raised six points against the Chinese Kuomintang in the United Kingdom, publicly pointing out the reasons. We now suddenly realized that the reasons he raised were nothing more than this. The British Emperor has approved Mr. Clementi's resignation, indicating that his policies and views may not necessarily represent the British government. Therefore, it increased our opportunity for discussion. We specially analyzed Mr. Clementi's various points based on objective facts and with a calm mind, so that people at home and abroad would know that Mr. Clementi does not yet have a full understanding of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3 id="e188">(II) Historical Facts of the Chinese Kuomintang's Activities in Malaya <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>To discuss the issue of the Chinese Kuomintang's activities in British Malaya, we should briefly recall the past evolution of our party, because the activity process of all things has its own continuous relationship and is never formed out of thin air. Everyone knows that the predecessor of the Chinese Kuomintang was the Chinese Revolutionary Party, the Tongmenghui, and the Xingzhonghui. At first, the revolutionary patriots were motivated by national revolution because the Qing court went against the grain, humiliated the country, and forfeited its sovereignty, and saw that the various ethnic groups in the country were facing destruction. At that time, overseas Chinese, unable to bear the danger of their motherland, cried out loudly and received widespread support. They did their best to provide spiritual and material assistance for the revolution. The earliest organizations of the Triad Society in Singapore, Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Seremban, and other places, This kind of society began in the early Qing Dynasty and flourished in the late Qing Dynasty, with the purpose of restoring the Ming Dynasty and destroying the Qing Dynasty. Later, when Sun Yat-sen arrived in Nanyang (Southeast Asia), he connected with many patriots of different factions, such as the Yi Hing Association, Yi Fu Association, Fu Xing Association, Hai Shan Association, Guang Fu Association, and the parties who had successively lost the mainland and fled into exile after Zheng Chenggong and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and conspired to restore the country. Therefore, overseas patriots followed Mr. Sun and joined the Tongmenghui. The patriotic overseas Chinese, contributing money and efforts, were even more prosperous for a time. Organizations like the Tongde Newspaper Society and Wanqing Garden in Singapore, the newly improved commercial firms in Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh, Juexing Garden, Civilized Pavilion, and the Xiaolan Pavilion and Guangyuan Reading Newspaper Society in Penang were all places where talents gathered. Branch associations in various places, such as Kuala Pilah, Seremban, Muar, etc., as well as distant places such as Yangon, the Dutch East Indies, Haiphong, and Siam, were filled with anti-Qing revolutionary comrades. After being changed to the Kuomintang in the first year of the Republic, a Kuomintang Transport Department was established in Singapore, and branch departments were established in various ports. After being changed to the Chinese Revolutionary Party three years later, the organization became even more grand. Although the Straits Settlements government had paid attention to it, legal requests for registration were made in the four Malay Federated States of Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, and Selangor, and permission was granted. It continued openly until 1925, a legitimate action without any harm to local security and order. Therefore, after being reorganized into the Chinese Kuomintang in 1924, in addition to the public party headquarters in the Malay Federation, it could still operate semi-publicly. During these decades, the party's general director, Mr. Zhongshan, and other important personnel of the party traveled and led in the Malayan region, and their comings and goings were extremely free. There was no obstacle to local famous overseas Chinese participating in the activities. The colonial authorities either watched coldly or secretly protected them. There has never been severe sanctions or dissolution. It was not until Mr. Clementi took office as Governor that the Chinese Kuomintang was labeled an illegal organization and banned. These historical facts can prove that the Kuomintang's activities did not hinder the resident government's intentions in the slightest. Moreover, the successive Governors of Singapore were not surprised by the Kuomintang's activities. It may not be that they were all less intelligent than Mr. Clementi. In fact, it was because Mr. Clementi ignored these historical facts that he could not help but be short-sighted.</p>
<h3 id="e189">(3) Mr. Kim's Six Points of Criticism and Questions for the Kuomintang <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>In his speech, Mr. Kim stated the following regarding the Kuomintang: "The Kuomintang's establishment in the Malay Peninsula contradicts local laws, yet it has openly operated since 1930, engaging in extensive political propaganda and encouraging local overseas Chinese, instilling anti-British sentiments in them. The Kuomintang's objectives in Malaya are:</p>
<p>(1) To organize all overseas Chinese in Malaya.</p>
<p>(2) To criticize laws that mistreat overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(3) To invest in various agricultural, industrial, and commercial activities.</p>
<p>(4) To place all Chinese schools under party control.</p>
<p>(5) To compile school textbooks instilling anti-British ideas.</p>
<p>(6) To emulate Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, implementing non-cooperation between Malay Chinese and the government. Furthermore, they utilize Chinese newspapers as propaganda tools, subjecting newspaper owners to immense pressure, and labor employers face similar oppression. In summary, the purpose of the Chinese Kuomintang's Malayan branch is to undermine the loyalty of all local overseas Chinese to the British government..."</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the phrase "organizing all overseas Chinese" is unclear. If it refers to "organization," it is neither notorious nor evil. The Kuomintang, being open and upright, would never stoop to bad organizations. Good "organizations," as mentioned above – such as Tongde Bookstore and Newspaper Agency, Wan Qing Yuan, Xin Gailiang Commercial Firm, Juexing Yuan, Wenming Ge, Xiao Lan Ting, Xin Guang Yuan, Reading Newspaper Agency, etc. – are mostly aimed at learning, public welfare, and loving the country. As for the existing overseas Chinese "organizations" – such as Chinese Chambers of Commerce in various places, various professional associations, Fujian, Guangfu, Chaozhou, Qiongzhou, Hakka associations, and San Yi, Si Yi, and county-based hometown associations and family groups, etc. – some are local in nature, others have clan significance, and all are for connecting feelings and strengthening kinship. They not only have no political function, but their establishment history predates the Kuomintang by decades or even centuries. In short, any overseas Chinese organization, new or old, must go through registration procedures with the local government before it can be established. Therefore, the phrase "organizing all overseas Chinese" is unclear whether it is a fabrication or based on reality. But examining ourselves from the perspective of the Kuomintang, we feel ashamed of our lack of such power. As for the overseas Chinese groups established before the Kuomintang, with their long history, how dare we claim their credit? The colonial government should have the wisdom to judge.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, the phrase "criticizing laws that mistreat overseas Chinese," if the word "mistreat" is not a subconscious revelation by Mr. Kim himself, we would not dare to assert that the colonial government intends to mistreat overseas Chinese. Because the British Malayan government even has specialized agencies in the Straits Settlements to protect animals and prohibit any abuse. How could they not cherish the overseas Chinese, who are also human beings under their rule? Mr. Kim's mention of "mistreatment" only exposes his own shortcomings. The Kuomintang does not bear any guilt. The British monarch would surely be displeased upon hearing this. Whether mistreatment exists is a question. If there is no such thing at all, what is there for us to criticize? If it exists, not only would the Kuomintang pay attention, but also the dignified British rule of law would not allow it.</p>
<p>Regarding the third point, "investing in various agricultural, industrial, and commercial activities," we must ask whether the prosperity of Malaya is limited to investment by a certain type of person or a certain country. Are we overseas Chinese worthy of operating industries in Malaya? We cannot find such a basis in past history or current laws. Malaya, from its beginnings, went through years of struggle with nature to develop into today's prosperity. Everyone acknowledges that it was due to the cooperation of the intelligence, physical strength, and courage of overseas Chinese with the political power of the British colonial government. Furthermore, examining the migration of our overseas Chinese ancestors, not to mention those who went as far back as the Jin Dynasty, even Zheng He's seven voyages to Southeast Asia in the early 15th century placed his footsteps more than a hundred years ahead of Westerners. At that time, amidst miasma and thickets, where humans and beasts coexisted, overseas Chinese, with their adventurous nature, creative spirit, and hardworking perseverance, opened up a paradise for later generations with knives and axes. This is not our self-praise. Twenty years ago, Resident Ryan of Singapore said, "Before the arrival of white men in Malaya, Chinese were already mining, fishing, trading, and farming here. When white men arrived, they engaged in large-scale construction, relying entirely on the strength of Chinese. Administrative expenses and funds relied on this. Chinese who came here mostly went deep into the jungles to clear the wilderness, braving dangers for great profits. Although many died from heatstroke and miasma, they ultimately conquered nature, becoming workers, woodcutters, potters, and builders. Cultural and material construction both originated from them. They also invested heavily in organizing steamship companies to facilitate transportation, recruiting workers, and developing land resources, allowing the government to tax them, accounting for nine-tenths of the total local fiscal revenue..." More recently (last year), at the Kuala Lumpur Agricultural Exhibition, Mr. Kim, during his speech at the opening ceremony in front of a large crowd of overseas Chinese, earnestly advised residents to strive to develop agriculture, promote rice, tea, tobacco, and other industries, and to use Malayan products as raw materials for daily necessities, without seeking them afar, hoping that the local area could implement industrialization. He also prepared to purchase private properties in the western part of Singapore, under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department, to develop factory areas, and the government would provide special accommodations for those willing to establish factories. From this, it can be seen that the contribution of overseas Chinese to the economic prosperity of Malaya in the past was so great, and the British government's current encouragement and rewards are also so generous. Therefore, investing in local industries is indeed beneficial to the livelihoods of the local people and enriches the government's coffers, benefiting both people and the land. Now, Mr. Kim criticizes overseas Chinese investment in industry in London, is this not a complete contradiction? How can this contradiction be explained? (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e190">Recent Overview of Education in Nanjing City <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing City Social Affairs Bureau recently conducted a survey and statistics on the status of education in Nanjing in the 22nd year of the Republic. Now, with reference to the recent educational situation in Nanjing after the summer vacation, a summary is extracted and recorded below.</p>
<p>Educational Expenses: The recurring expenses of educational undertakings in Nanjing City are actually 57,503 yuan per month, which is divided into ten items: 1. First Middle School: 4,994 yuan; 2. Complete Primary Schools: 38,966 yuan; 3. Compulsory Primary Schools: 6,257 yuan; 4. Subsidies for Private Primary Schools: 934 yuan; 5. Vocational Supplementary Schools: 1,160 yuan; 6.

Experimental Mass Education Center: 565 yuan.</p>
<p>Primary School Education: There are 39 municipal complete primary schools, with a total of 353 classes and 15,926 students (both male and female). There are 30 compulsory primary schools, with a total of 116 classes and 5,442 students (both male and female). After the summer vacation of the current 23rd year, in addition to merging the Kao Peng Primary School and Xinfuhe Primary School, several complete primary schools and compulsory primary schools will be added in Hankou Road, Shanxi Road, Jiulong Bridge, Jiangdongmen and other places. The number of additional classes is about 80. This is the situation of municipal primary schools. In addition, there are also the First and Second Traffic Workers' Children's Primary Schools in the capital, the Rotary Club of Pukou, the Rotary Club of Nanjing, the Children of Workers of the Jinling Arsenal, and the Children's School of the Capital Police, totaling 6 schools, 46 classes, and 1,603 students (both male and female). There are also the National Central University Experimental School and the two experimental primary schools of the Provincial Nanjing Middle School and Nanjing Women's Middle School, which belong to the scope of public, national and provincial schools. There are a total of 30 private primary schools that have been registered, with 109 classes and 4,365 students (both male and female). There are 16 schools with 63 classes and 1,958 students (both male and female) that have not yet completed the registration.</p>
<p>Kindergarten Education: 16 municipal schools have attached kindergartens, with a total of 888 children (both male and female). 5 private schools have attached kindergartens, with 240 children (both male and female). Number of Private Schools: Divided into 8 bureaus in the police station area, with a total of 574 schools and 14,995 students (12,054 males and 2,941 females).</p>
<p>Secondary School Education: There is only one municipal First Middle School, with 9 junior high school classes and 267 students (both male and female), 2 senior high school normal classes with 94 students (both male and female), and 3 senior high school general classes with 107 students (both male and female). There are 15 private middle schools that have been registered, with 75 junior high school classes and 3,245 students (both male and female), and 100 senior high school general classes with 2,138 students (both male and female). There are 8 schools that have not yet completed the registration procedures, with a total of 26 classes (1 senior high school class), and 954 students (both male and female).</p>
<p>Social Education: In the municipal area, in addition to schools for the blind and deaf, vocational supplementary schools, public libraries, experimental civil education centers, and civil education centers, swimming pools, public reading boards, popular lecture groups, drama review, vocational guidance, the Nanjing Literature and Nanjing Sports committees, etc., the Civil School has been open for 10 sessions. In the past, from the first to the ninth sessions, a total of 366 schools, 427 classes, 18,830 students and 10,657 graduates were held. In the 22nd year, there were 8 civil schools, and several schools attached with primary schools and compulsory primary schools. This year, after the summer vacation of the 12th session, one school will be added outside Hanximen Street and one school will be added in Xixiting, north of Dashugen inside Xuanwu Lake Gate. Together with the previous eight schools, there are a total of 10 schools. These are the ones established separately. There are 16 schools attached to simple primary schools and 10 schools attached to complete primary schools. In the private sector, there are 19 supplementary schools, with varying levels of primary and secondary schools. In addition to three or four schools with bookkeeping, typing, electricity, and pharmacy courses, the rest focus on knowledge subjects.</p>
<p>Vocational Education: The Qiwang Street Vocational Supplementary School and the Confucius Temple Women's Vocational Supplementary School, which were originally run in the city, did not have many vocational subjects. This year, they were reorganized after the summer vacation, focusing on vocational skills. The Qiwang Street Supplementary School has classes in civil engineering, Chinese typing, commercial advertising, and accounting (this class is held in the evening). The Confucius Temple Women's Supplementary School has been changed to a sewing class and a general housekeeping class. In addition, an infant care class has been established in Puyutang. This is currently a way to cope with poverty. After raising considerable funds, we will formally establish vocational schools. Previously, we planned to apply for Gengkuan subsidies to establish senior vocational schools, but due to the allocation of funds for this session, it was not mentioned. Therefore, not only can senior vocational schools not be established at present, but it is also difficult to establish junior vocational schools.</p>
<p>Cultural Groups: There are currently 48 cultural groups in Nanjing that have been approved or have reported to the Ministry of Education for record, including the Academic Research Association Resident Office in Nanjing, the Nanjing Library Association, the Capital Kindergarten Education Research Society, the Chinese Economic Society, the Chinese Agricultural Society, the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Astronomical Society, the Chinese Forestry Society, the Secondary Arithmetic Research Society, the Chinese Children's Education Society, the National Mandarin Education Promotion Association, the New China Agricultural Society, the Chinese Sociological Society, the Chinese Metrology Society, the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Art and Craft Society, the Chinese Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society, the Chinese Testing Society, the Nanjing Calligraphy and Painting Research Society, the Chinese Political Science Society, the Chinese Scientific Movement Association, the Chinese Accounting and Political Society, the Chinese Chemical Society, the Fujian Students Association in Nanjing, the Chinese Medical Improvement Society, the New Education Research Society, the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese National Medicine Society, the Boy Scout Academic Research Society, the New Asia Society, the Chinese Political Economy Society, the Chinese Buddhist Society, the World Buddhist Society, the 19 Society, the Chinese Police Association, the Nanjing Irrigation Improvement Association, the Nanjing Amateur Sports Association, the Fourth North Cultural Research Society, the Border Society, the Anhui Students Association in Nanjing, the Chinese Municipal Administration Society, the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Science Society, the Japanese Research Society, the Chinese Land Society, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, the Rural Economic Research Society, the Fujian Construction Promotion Association, the Chinese Statistical Society, and the Religious Philosophy Research Society.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Chinese Science Society Edits Scientific National Renaissance <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Observing the Chinese nation from a scientific perspective</p>
<p>Invite scholars to dedicate their research results to the people</p>
<p>The Chinese Science Society recently launched the editing of a book called "Scientific National Renaissance". The origin and content of the book are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Origin: The poverty and weakness of our country today is well known. The way to save poverty lies in developing resources, and the way to save the weak lies in reorganizing the military and political affairs. These two can be realized in the short term. There is something even more important than this, that is, whether our nation itself has the ability to compete for survival. European and American countries regard us as an inferior nation, and our compatriots boast that we are an ancient country of culture and an excellent nation. With today's progress of science, this problem cannot be solved. Observing the Chinese nation from a scientific point of view and then deciding on the way to revive it is the purpose of this book. The country has already shouted for national revival, but most of them think from a political perspective. Our publication of this book is not to cater to the fashion, but to invite domestic scholars to contribute their research on various aspects of the nation, such as climate, food, and life expectancy, and tell the people of the country for reference in reviving the nation. Such research is often guided by scientists abroad, and many have actually implemented it politically. Even in terms of the descendants of idiots, Germany has strictly implemented it. The British capital has several states that implement it. In Germany, there will be 40,000 people who will be sterilized because they are rejected. The population of Germany is 62 million, so one in every 1,300 people will be sterilized. The precision of its selection is so great. There are more disabled and inferior people in our country than in Germany. Even in terms of the German ratio, at least 300,000 people in our country should undergo this operation, but our country has not paid attention to this. Thirty years later, the German nation will become more and more excellent, and our Chinese nation will become more and more inferior. What achievements can be said about cultural revival and cultural construction in this inferior nation? This is why we are so alarmed. There are many ways to revitalize the nation and improve the race through scientific methods. Food, education, and health are all dependent on the research of scientists. This book is not a prescription, but a stimulant. Domestic scientists are either concerned about this issue and have not completed their research, or they are concerned and have already achieved results. Therefore, we invite comrades to compile this book as a pioneer for the revitalization of the nation. This is also one of the ways our society serves China with science.</p>
<p>Content: Chapter 1: Historical Observation of the Chinese Nation; Chapter 2: Geographical Distribution of the Chinese Nation (led by Zhang Xiaofeng of National Central University); Chapter 3: Ancient Chinese Culture (led by Li Ji); Chapter 4: Northeastern Culture and the Chinese Nation (led by Ling Chunsheng); Chapter 5: Southwestern Chinese Culture (led by Liu Chongxi); Chapter 6: Climate and Chinese Culture (led by Zhu Kezhen); Chapter 7: Physiology of the Chinese Nation (led by Wu Taomin); Chapter 8: Physique of the Chinese Nation (led by Wu Junyi); Chapter 9: The Brain and Intelligence of the Chinese People (led by Lu Yudao); Chapter 10: Improvement of the Chinese Nation (led by Tao Yunkui); Chapter 11: Hygiene of the Chinese Nation (led by Yuan Yicheng); Chapter 12: Bloodline of the Chinese Nation (led by Li Chengpian); Chapter 13: Scientific National Renaissance. There are a total of 13 chapters and 130,000 words, with a period of six months.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Agricultural Expert Yu Hongzheng Returned from Japan Yesterday After Investigation <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Agricultural Equipment is Extremely Simple</p>
<p>However, Japanese Scholars are Willing to Devote Themselves to Work</p>
<p>Professor Yu Hongzheng of Beiping University, an agricultural expert, was sent by the school to Japan to investigate agriculture a month ago. Now Mr. Yu has returned from Japan. A reporter from Guomin News Agency made a special visit. According to him, this trip to Japan was specifically for agricultural investigation, school equipment, and agricultural laboratory conditions. Generally speaking, Japanese agriculture has made considerable progress, but the simplicity of agricultural laboratory equipment is not as good as that of our country. However, the spirit of scholars' hard work and perseverance, and their dedication to work day and night, makes us infinitely admired. Although Chinese agricultural education has not made significant progress, in recent years, students who study agriculture have been willing to go deep into the countryside to work, which is indeed a good phenomenon. If we can persist in this for a long time, it is very hopeful for improving the future of agriculture. It is heard that Mr. Yu has decided to take the train back to Beiping today to draft an investigation report.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Honors of Li Weining, Chinese Prodigy Musician <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Praised by European Musicians</p>
<p>Li Weining, in his early twenties, is from Sichuan, China. He studied at Tsinghua University, but due to his love for music, he focused on this subject, leading to weaker performance in other subjects and preventing him from graduating. Later, someone recognized his musical talent and sponsored him to study in France, where he studied music for two years under the guidance of famous teachers, enabling him to make significant progress. He then entered the Vienna State Academy of Music in Austria, from which he has now graduated. He has achieved profound skill in music and is admired by musicians in various European countries. In mid-July of this year, during a large gathering, a certain famous Japanese musician composed lyrics, sang, and played the piano. Viennese people considered him just an ordinary pianist. However, when the young Chinese Li Weining composed and performed, everyone marveled at his talent as magical and rare. This was broadcast on the radio. The Vienna Daily News on July 17th reported: "The young Chinese composer Li Weining is a free student of Mr. Dan Di, the Dean of the Paris Conservatory of Music, and also a disciple of the Viennese musicians Max and Wieger. He broadcast his works on the radio, presenting them to the public. The music he played is part of his works, including a long piano variation and several songs. These works demonstrate his competence and mastery of European music. Professor Yang Boer performed this long piano piece and added 'Light and Splendid' (曲名). The listeners could not imagine that the composer of this piece was Chinese. This piece is very suitable for the piano, showing the author's deep understanding of the instrument's characteristics. The French listeners felt that Mr. Li's works were delicate and elegant, reminiscent of the French musicians Couperin and Dan Di, but with a romantic touch. The French considered it similar to the piano music of Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Schumann. The songs are full of Chinese flavor and rich emotion. The singer, Mr. Ruo Jita, has endless variations in his melody, which is very free and unrestrained, sometimes like a groan, and often has elements of grand opera. The sounds imitate each other at times. The strangest thing is that sometimes it sounds like European folk music, especially 'Thoughts on the Pond' (池上寓興) (a phrase from Bai Juyi's poem)." Also, the Times reported on July 18th: "Li Weining's Central European music adds luster to the Paris and Vienna schools, especially his variations and fugues, which express his Chinese heritage without any flaws and in the best possible way. On the one hand, he deeply understands and penetrates Western musical culture, and on the other hand, he has not damaged or forgotten his inherent Chinese nature. If he continues to work like this, he can introduce world music to China and simultaneously add ancient Chinese culture and characteristics to European music. Mr. Ruo Jita sang with a very detailed understanding, carefully translating the Chinese lyrics into German. The composer himself accompanied the songs on the piano, and his piano playing showed that he is a perfect Viennese pianist." Furthermore, the Austrian government newspaper also published praise, calling Li Weining from Sichuan, China, a genius artist who became famous in one fell swoop (words omitted for brevity). It is heard that a Chinese musician is called a genius and admired by famous European musicians, which is unprecedented. However, Mr. Li studies music at his own expense, and his situation is difficult. He has recently submitted a document to the Ministry of Education, recounting his painstaking efforts in studying music and his current difficulties, requesting a subsidy to continue his studies and bring glory to the motherland. It is hoped that China will cultivate outstanding musical talents and help him achieve his ambition to further his studies.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Announcement of Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Scholarship <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The Siming University Scholarship Committee, for the purpose of cultivating the studies of fellow villagers' children, who continue or enter domestic universities or research institutes with excellent academic performance, will, after application and approval, issue scholarships to encourage them. The details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is heard that since the association set a registration deadline, the number of Ningbo students who applied for registration included: (1) eighty-four who continued their studies at university; (2) one who continued their studies at a research institute; (3) eighty-eight who entered university; (4) seven who planned to enter a research institute, totaling one hundred and eighty-eight. The review team members reviewed the applications according to the regulations. According to the review results, seventy-six names met the original standards, and twenty-four names met the qualifications but failed due to other allocation standards. It is heard that the association convened a full committee meeting yesterday. The attending committee members were Yu Qiaqing, Sun Hengfu, Zhang Shouyong, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Boyuan, Qin Runqing, Li Quanshi, Li Gufan, Hu Xi'an, Zhang Shenzhi, Wei Bozhen, Wu Yaqin, Hu Mengjia, Zheng Chengqing, Li Shuxiong, Yu Zuoting, etc., chaired by Director Wei Bozhen. The chairman reported on the review process, and it was determined that only seventy-six names met the original allocation standards after review. Among them, Zhu Peinong voluntarily waived his scholarship and should be given an honorary certificate. There were also twenty-four names that passed the review but were restricted by the allocation standards. The matter was submitted for discussion, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Those who passed the review and met the original allocation standards, except for Zhu Peinong, who voluntarily waived according to Article 10 of these regulations and will be given an honorary certificate by the association, the remaining students should, after the announcement, immediately go to the association with their guarantors to fill out the application form and guarantee. After completing the procedures, the association will directly submit the scholarship to the school where the student is studying for transfer. Those who are far away and cannot personally go to the association may have their guarantors send the application form, which the student should fill out and submit to the association. (2) It is noted that the first scholarship, originally set at one hundred and twenty-five slots, had different allocation standards for those who were already studying at university and those who were entering university, with further divisions into science, engineering, commerce, agriculture, medicine, liberal arts, and law. Students who had passed the review but failed to be selected due to the original allocation standards had excellent grades, and the current scholarship also had a surplus. A flexible approach should be adopted, borrowing slots from Category A to supplement Category B, and borrowing slots from Subject B to supplement Subject A, so that all students who have passed the review will not feel disappointed. The procedures for claiming the scholarship should also be handled according to the above items. (3) The association still has a surplus of scholarships. Any Ningbo student studying at a university who has excellent grades and applies for a scholarship according to the scholarship regulations will be allowed to extend the deadline to September 30th. This grand event of the Ningbo people has attracted the attention of the community. Followers are emerging, and some fellow villagers' associations are preparing to proceed. Next year, scholarship programs from various regions will spring up like bamboo shoots after rain, competing to initiate, which is a good phenomenon in the country.</p>

<p>Maple Floors Suitable for Running and Hard-court Tennis</p>
<p>Divided into Six Departments, Expected to be Completed This Year</p>
<p>In order to develop the sports industry and provide physical training for the community, Scott Qiu Feihai and others in the Chinese and foreign sports communities have pooled huge sums of money to build a large-scale Meiyuan Indoor Gymnasium on Juelaida Road. Construction has now begun and is expected to be completed in a short period of time. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparing for Construction: Shanghai is densely populated, but the facilities for sports are still very scarce. Now Scott Qiu Feihai and others in the sports community are planning to build a large-scale gymnasium for public recreation and physical training, named Meiyuan Indoor Gymnasium. The equipment is complete, and all the plans are ready. Construction has begun.</p>
<p>Beautiful Construction: The construction of the gymnasium is budgeted at 120,000 yuan, which has already been raised. The land has been leased on Juelaida Road in the French Concession, with a total area of 7.5 acres. It is designed by Shabode. (The equipment is very complete and the most durable maple is used for the floor). This kind of wood can be used as an ice rink and a hard-court tennis court. The gymnasium is divided into ice skating, basketball, tennis, boxing, fitness, and wine row departments. It is currently being contracted by Wu Cangji Construction Factory and construction has begun.</p>
<p>Completed Within the Year: The Meiyuan Indoor Gymnasium is currently located at 627 North Sichuan Road, Seamen's YMCA, as a temporary office. Scott is currently serving as the temporary curator. The capital is a combination of Chinese and Western. It is heard that Qiu Feihai has been designated as the director of the tennis department. The museum has now begun to solicit members, both groups and individuals are very welcome. The construction project is expected to be completed within the year.</p>

<p>According to Article 3 of the resolution of the Shanghai Chinese Football Conference on September 7th (Members who wish to join this season's league must have a qualified football field (either self-provided or leased). Those who do not have a field will not be allowed to register). However, in fact, most of the teams do not have a field. If they are affected by this field and cannot join the league, the grand event of the past few years will be interrupted, which is very frustrating. The Takahashi Amateur Sports Association, feeling this, has passed a resolution by the Executive Committee to provide the association's football field to all teams in this season's league unconditionally. The field is located in the center of the Takahashi District. From 7 am to 6 pm, every hour, take the municipal ferry from the Copper Man Wharf to the Takahashi Wharf and transfer to the public bus directly. Any maritime teams who wish to join this season's league but do not have their own field can contact the following four places: (1) Shen Zhengui, Asia Petroleum Company, No. 1 Bund, local sales office, telephone 18,718; (2) Ji Zhiyuan, No. 15 Edward Road, Grain Exchange, telephone 80,392; (3) Sun Gengyan, Pudong Qingning Temple Municipal Ferry Management Office, telephone Pudong 160; (4) This association, Takahashi District, this city.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Third Anniversary (Part 1) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>An autumn night.</p>
<p>From the open window, the night breeze carried wafts of the scent of grains. An indescribable joy welled up in Old Mrs. Huang's heart. She thanked the heavens for another good harvest this year. But then she immediately remembered an old matter, murmuring: (Just don't let it be like last year.)</p>
<p>Last year's harvest was excellent, but the grain couldn't fetch a good price. It was all the Japanese devils' doing, forcing down grain prices. Nine out of ten farming families in the village lost their capital. As for Old Mrs. Huang, although she didn't rely on farming to make a living, she always got a share of grain from the tenant farmers every year. In a year of good harvest, she could get a few more stones of grain. If grain prices were higher, wouldn't she be able to save a little money?</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Huang wasn't a miserly money-grubber, but circumstances forced her to have these small hopes.</p>
<p>(Ahem!...)</p>
<p>After a cough, she sighed again at her bitter, gentian-like fate. She had a good, proper family. Herself, plus two sons. The eldest son had taken a wife and even had a granddaughter. She was just waiting for her second son to get married, and then she would have completed her duty as a mother, and could enjoy a little happiness in her old age. But her fate was unkind (Old Mrs. Huang firmly believed in fate). Her eldest son was serving as a minor officer in the Changchun army, just about to make progress and bring honor to the family, when the Japanese soldiers suddenly became violent and occupied Changchun. Her son lost his life in that battle. He was a piece of flesh from her own body; how could she not be heartbroken? Later, when she heard the news, she cried as if she were dying. Fortunately, she still had one son left, which gave her a little comfort amidst her grief. She advised her daughter-in-law to put all her hopes on her younger brother-in-law, so that when he became famous, she, as his sister-in-law, would surely enjoy happiness in her later years. However, things were getting worse and worse. After the death of his brother, her second son ran away. He left secretly, leaving Old Mrs. Huang a simple letter, saying that he was joining the Volunteer Army to kill Japanese soldiers, to avenge his brother and others, to wipe out shame, and to recover lost territory. So, Old Mrs. Huang felt as if she had fallen from heaven to hell. She had no hope left, only a deep pain that could never be washed away.</p>
<p>She always thought of others, especially her daughter-in-law. She felt so sorry for her, widowed at such a young age, and without any hope for the future. How sad! One time, she spoke frankly to her daughter-in-law:</p>
<p>(You don't need to worry. Now that things have come to this, worrying is useless. I think it's like this: you can do whatever you want.)</p>
<p>But her daughter-in-law didn't listen to her. She continued to live her life, raising her daughter.</p>
<p>(Tomorrow is that day again?)</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Huang abandoned the scent of grain in her nostrils and let go of her painful memories. She reached for an almanac and looked at it under the lamp. Yes, tomorrow was indeed that day. She almost forgot. She folded a page in the almanac, marking it. There, printed in black ink on white paper, it clearly read:</p>
<p>(September 18th.)</p>
<p>She closed the almanac and called out to the outer room:</p>
<p>(Xiao Lan, come here.)</p>
<p>A five- or six-year-old girl came running in, bouncing and jumping, asking:</p>
<p>(Grandma, what is it?)</p>
<p>(Where's your mother?)</p>
<p>(My mother?)</p>
<p>(Yes.)</p>
<p>(She, she's lying down.)</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Huang understood and said urgently:</p>
<p>(Go, call your mother. Tell her I need her.)</p>
<p>The child left. Tears welled up in Old Mrs. Huang's eyes. Tomorrow, September 18th, would be the third anniversary of the day her eldest son died in the Changchun military camp. Three years had passed so quickly. She wiped her eyes and looked out the window. Outside, there was heavy darkness. Old Mrs. Huang dared not look. She quickly closed her eyes tightly. She imagined that the darkness outside was like the darkness and hopelessness that would engulf her family in the days to come.</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Northeast Volunteer Army <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>As the third anniversary of the September 18th Incident approaches, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the issue of the "Red Armbands." I hope the readers will not consider this meaningless.</p>
<p>(What are the Red Armbands?) That's what you must be asking. Yes, I must first explain this term.</p>
<p>"Red Armbands" - no need to cite classics or give lengthy explanations. In a word, they are the Volunteer Army fighting the Japanese in the Northeast! Because they wear a red armband on their sleeves (that is, on their arms) as a mark.</p>
<p>It is said that last year was a bad year for the Red Armbands, but this year there has been a major turnaround. This has a history. A friend of mine who is a Red Armband recently came from the Northeast and told me about the situation.</p>
<p>Speaking of the bad luck of the Red Armbands last year, it was mainly due to the harm inflicted by the Japanese. The Japanese declared to the common people that the Red Armbands were bandits (they have always used this deception to fool the people), that they were disturbing the people, and were the people's enemy. Therefore, the people should try to defend themselves and fight the Red Armbands to the death. If they could capture one, they would be rewarded with money according to the rules. The average people have a very weak sense of national identity and have always preferred to live a comfortable private life. As a result, in order to covet money and maintain their comfortable state, they naturally needed to make things difficult for the Red Armbands and oppose them. Therefore, wherever the Red Armbands went, the people would use their own weapons to attack them head-on. Forced with no alternative and unable to gain a foothold anywhere, these struggling Red Armbands had no choice but to retreat into the mountains and subsist on wild grass and fruit.</p>
<p>At that time, no Red Armband dared to appear on rural roads alone, otherwise they would be in danger of losing their lives at any time.</p>
<p>In that period, the Japanese soldiers did not need to come out themselves, and they were able to subdue the activities of the Volunteer Army in the countryside.</p>
<p>The common people and the Red Armbands became enemies.</p>
<p>But this year, the situation is very different. Because the Japanese have collected civilian firearms everywhere since the spring, and have also forcibly seized land deeds, the people's livelihood is no different from being pushed to a dead end. As a result, with no way to go and no door to enter, they immediately took the risk. The people who used to oppose the Red Armbands have now become Red Armbands themselves, and the two sides have become brothers in distress.</p>
<p>Since the Red Armbands are having good luck this year, their actions are also much more convenient. Even if the people have not joined the organization, at least their impression of the Red Armbands has changed. They not only communicate with the Red Armbands, but also are happy to provide the Red Armbands with some supplies within the scope of their possibilities.</p>
<p>This also has a clear source. Since the Japanese soldiers confiscated all the civilian firearms in the Northeast this spring, whenever Red Armbands or even real bandits arrived in the summer, the people were helpless and unable to resist. This is one of the people's plights. In addition, when rural areas report alarms, Japanese soldiers never come to the countryside to protect them. It is not until after the Red Armbands have retreated that the Japanese soldiers arrive, but this is not helpful. They either arrest a few people and falsely accuse them of colluding with bandits, or they burn down all the houses in the area. This kind of abuse and persecution provides the Red Armbands with an opportunity to expand their power.</p>
<p>Now, Red Armbands can walk alone without weapons, and as long as they don't encounter Japanese soldiers, they will no longer encounter people's ambushes wherever they go.</p>
<p>This is an ironclad fact!</p>
<p>The development of the Red Armbands can only be reliable and promising if they are united with the people. This is why the Japanese soldiers dare not go to the countryside to search and suppress them.</p>
<p>Here is a rather comical thing: the security teams and police teams in the cities and towns of the Northeast now have yellow armbands as their mark, belonging to the (Manchu) country. People call them "Yellow Armbands." Recently, the yellow armband has been replaced with a red background on the back. This provides a convenience: if they encounter the Red Armbands coming over, they can turn the Yellow Armband mark over to avoid the Red Armbands' difficulties.</p>
<p>Some people may think that the development of the Northeast Volunteer Army has reached a standstill, and some even deny the existence of the Volunteer Army. I cannot agree with this. The number of Volunteer Army members is irrelevant, and the pace of development is also irrelevant. The most important thing is their firm confidence - their will - that is, their principles! The anti-Japanese armies of the past, some were bought off and some were sold out. They are all in the past and no longer worth mentioning. As for the current Red Armbands, they can be said to be true anti-Japanese warriors. Only they want neither money nor fame! They are more able to endure hardship, and their only mission is:</p>
<p>(To resist the armed aggression of Japanese imperialism to the death!)</p>
<p>We can say, wishing the Red Armbands victory:</p>
<p>(The Red Armbands are the true anti-Japanese peasant Volunteer Army.)</p>

<h3 id="e219">Remembering Langzhong (Part 2) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Chuanren</p>
<p>I was puzzled and wanted to ask about what was happening, but no one dared to answer me. I paid the bill at the teahouse, lowered my head, and walked straight towards the Temple of Lord Huan.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Temple of Lord Huan, it is truly famous! Who doesn't know that Langzhong Prefecture was the garrison land of Zhang Fei, a famous general of the Shu Han period during the Three Kingdoms era! Even now, Lord Zhang is still mighty and awe-inspiring. Last year, the Red Bandits attacked the other side of the Jialing River, separated from the government troops by only a river. The wealthy people in the city wanted to flee, but they were hesitant. So they asked Lord Zhang to descend to the altar and perform automatic writing to answer questions and help them decide. Lord Zhang firmly replied: (The Red Bandits will definitely not be able to cross the river and enter the city. You don't need to panic and flee. I, Lord Zhang, will survive or perish with the city. You can rest assured!) Therefore, all the officials, gentry, and wealthy people obeyed his orders and were willing to remain under the protection of Lord Zhang's spirit, and they decided not to leave. Later, the Red Bandits did not cross the river and naturally did not enter the city, but retreated. So, amidst the cheers of the masses, they bathed Lord Zhang and changed his clothes, burned incense, and kowtowed to him in succession. However, due to the poverty of the people and the exhaustion of their wealth, they did not rebuild Lord Zhang's temple. This is something that the people of the district are still concerned about!</p>
<p>The Hall of Lord Huan is said to be a Song dynasty building. His statue is said to closely resemble the man himself.</p>
<p>A short stature, a dark and swarthy face, two round eyes that almost popped out - we, who were not born in the Shu Han era, have no way of judging whether it closely resembles him or not. However, the statue of the deity is sculpted in a simple and approachable manner, not as strange and terrifying as on the stage. Behind the statue is a tombstone, and the tomb is built right behind the hall. The tomb itself is naturally very large. Someone told me that the body of Zhang Fei is inside the tomb, while his head was cut off by Fan Jiang, Zhang Da, and others and taken to Yunyang County, where it was later buried. So, Lord Zhang's body and head were separated after death.</p>
<p>These are all beside the point.</p>
<p>Regarding the local products of Langzhong, there is a Pagoda Formula as proof. The formula says:</p>
<p>(Vinegar, preserved eggs, Pinellia ternata koji, white sugar steamed cake, five-spice dried tofu, Sichuan Army Lieutenant General.) The last item is a bit humorous, but it is true that the Lieutenant General of the Army belongs to Sichuan, and this is actually the case, not intentionally promoting local products.</p>
<p>Before leaving, we originally wanted to see the famous sites that the Tang Dynasty poets praised, such as the palace of Prince Lingkui of Lu and the garden of Prince Yuanying of Teng, but the wounds we suffered in our hearts during those two days were already deep, and we were unwilling to be deceived again. Therefore, the memories that Langzhong gave me are just these!</p>
<h3 id="e220">Mr. Village Head (Part 4) <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>Village policeman Dong Sheng, hobbled around the corner. He had a crippled hand, all five fingers cut to an inch long, like ginger joints. But he used to be a helmsman operating the pestle in an oil mill. He had plenty of strength back then. He could carry a two-hundred-pound tree from the top of the mountain to the bottom without using a (short pole). Now, he seemed a bit old. He couldn't sell his strength, so he had to become this village policeman who always ate soldiers' (canned ham) and (tin-packaged cigarettes)!</p>
<p>(This damn job, it's not fit for a human!) Helplessly, Dong Sheng the cripple sighed. (And yet I became one! Sigh! I'm no longer a human! Dog!)</p>
<p>Dong Sheng the cripple, like a mangy dog that had a bucket of hot water splashed on its back and lost all its fur, paced on the street.</p>
<p>(Dong Sheng the cripple! Dong Sheng the cripple!) Mr. Feng Wen suddenly shouted out. Listening to his own shout, it almost sounded like the village head speaking. So he lowered his face and quietly, awkwardly, but seemingly necessarily solemnly, shouted: (Come here!)</p>
<p>Dong Sheng, with his crippled hand, limped over, as if his foot was also crippled.</p>
<p>(What is it, A-Wen!) In terms of seniority, Dong Sheng was an uncle, and Mr. Wen was a nephew. Calling him A-Wen didn't seem offensive. However, no, Mr. Feng Wen cursed in his heart: (Damn it!) Then:</p>
<p>(Did you put up those notices?)</p>
<p>(Which batch?) Dong Sheng the cripple tilted one shoulder and stopped. (There are so many notices now. Today it's some team, tomorrow it's some army… Which batch are you talking about?)</p>
<p>(It's the one that encourages young men to become reserve soldiers.) Mr. Feng Wen felt that his tone was quite calm and generous, just like the district chief spoke to him.</p>
<p>(Oh! Oh! You mean that conscription notice?) Village policeman Dong Sheng closed his eyes and smiled knowingly. (Doing that is like planting radishes in the spring – nobody will go. Nobody will go to throw their lives away. It'll be torn down in less than a day!)</p>
<p>(Torn down!) The village head jumped up, immediately thinking about his position, which had been formally appointed. (That won't do. That won't do! That won't do! It's a matter between you and me. Can you take responsibility for that? I have another one at home. You put it up again! Put it up again!)</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Wen turned back and headed home. Village policeman Dong Sheng limped behind him.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Gold Futures for November Slightly Lower at Opening, Down ¥1.80 <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>December New Standard Trading Commences Simultaneously</p>
<p>The gold market saw a sluggish and mediocre day yesterday after the Ministry of Finance's reply arrived, following a late-night meeting convened by the Gold Exchange Guild. The decision was made to commence trading for the December new standard concurrently. However, transaction volume was low. The day began with overseas silver markets showing London up and the US flat, with London spot gold down 1.5 pence. Exchange rates opened higher and closed lower, with limited fluctuations. US cotton was down 8 points, US wheat slightly contracted, and stock price fluctuations were minor. Reports indicated that French Finance Minister Mr. Mardan stated that the French budget was well-balanced and would not lead to abandoning the gold standard. He also expressed that the world would soon realize that gold's stability as a currency base was the only basis for exchange rates and would restore normal relations, etc. However, due to the disputes between the November and December periods, the gold market was in a state of confusion and tended towards closure for quite some time. It was not until after 10:30 AM that the doubts were dispelled, and the December period also started simultaneously. However, there were few transactions, with an absence of a market. The highest preliminary trading price was ¥960, with indecisive movements. The November period officially opened steadily, but later, due to a lack of buying appetite from banks and a sudden loosening of the exchange rate, a selling trend emerged. There were also few chips in the market, with a temporary lack of buyers, causing a decline. However, there were still many bargain hunters taking advantage of the low prices to cover their short positions, resulting in a stable situation at noon. The afternoon market opened steadily, but due to the banks' appetite trending towards saturation and large players continuously selling off, the market weakened. However, a report from Bombay indicated a decline of one anna and stability, with a potential rebound. Before anything could happen, the banks released stocks again and again, causing the domestic market to loosen. Supply exceeded demand, causing a further drop. Finally, despite the news of Bombay rebounding one anna and remaining stable, the market had already turned quiet. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was ¥954 (at 10:30 AM), an increase of ¥1 from the extended closure on Saturday. Da De Cheng and others sold at ¥3.40, while Qing Yu, Tong Chun, Fu Xing, Yong Da Xing, Yong Ze Jin bought, rising to ¥5. The exchange rate was normal. Fu An, Fu Yu, Yuan Mao Yong sold, retreating to ¥3.50. Fu Xing, Yong Yuan Xing, Yuan Chang Yong, etc. still bought, rising to ¥4.80. Hua Shang sought to cover September at ¥35.50 but failed. Zhao Feng, Chang De Kang, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Da Xing Yong, etc. all sold. He Lan released October US dollars at 5625, causing a drop to ¥1. Tong Tai Chang Heng Yu took advantage of the low price to buy to ¥1. Hua Bi released October US dollars at 5625, with retail investors still selling, retreating to ¥1.20. Hua Shang sought to close October US dollars at 5625 but failed. Qian Chang Xiang, Tong Tai Chang Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Sen Chang Yong, etc. jointly purchased strips, rising to ¥2.60. Hua Bi released October US dollars at ¥0.50, Ying Feng Heng, etc. still sold, and it fell to ¥1.70. Retail investors bought, and Ri Chang, etc. also accepted. The noon closing rose again to ¥953.30.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at ¥951.80. Wan Xing, Da Cheng, Yu Qing, Yong Yuan Mao Yong, etc. bought strips, rising to ¥2.70. Hua Bi sold September US dollars at ¥0.50. Fu Chang previously sold, dropping to ¥1.30. The Bombay report indicated a contraction of one anna. Wan Xing Yuan Mao Yong, etc. bought to ¥2.40. Hua Bi sold December US dollars at 625, engaging in hedging activities. Fu Chang Heng Yu, Ri Chang, Wu Chang Yong, etc. sold aggressively, causing a drop to ¥0.05. Qing Yu Da De Cheng accepted strips. Although Bombay rose one anna, it rose to ¥1.40. Hua Bi released October US dollars, having already released 5625. Fu Chang Heng Xing sold, dropping to ¥0.08. Da De Cheng, Yi Feng Yong, Shen Kang, etc. still accepted. The closing price was ¥951.20. The highest price of the day was ¥955, the lowest price was ¥950.50, a total fluctuation of ¥4.50. The result was a continuation of the decline from last Saturday, down ¥1.80.</p>
<p>The settlement price, due to the HSBC US dollar listing remaining unchanged, was calculated at ¥35.25, resulting in a standard gold price of ¥981 strong. Based on the closing price, approximately ¥30 was retained, slightly more than the ¥2 retained last Saturday. The December new standard settlement price was changed to follow the Customs Gold settlement price. Today's listing was 1732, calculated at 5078, resulting in a standard gold price of around ¥981. Based on the closing price, about ¥30 was retained. (If calculated directly using London spot gold, it would be more than ¥20 lower, due to intermediate costs such as transportation and labor, and because of China's ban on gold exports.) This month's accounting price was ¥952, the same as October, the same as November, and the same as December. The morning water supplement was ¥952, and the afternoon was ¥951. Red gold prices were listed at ¥964, adding ¥10. There were no proper transactions in the market, because customers were afraid to be active due to the confusion in the gold market. Tianjin goods added ¥12.50, a higher water supplement than last Saturday, due to premium relations. Only 455 strips remained this month, with a total of seven long positions and two short positions.</p>

The afternoon market gradually approached the November period as demand gradually increased, opening at ¥951.20, then rising to ¥2.20, then retreating to ¥0.02. The closing price was ¥950.90.

<p>(Gold Exchange Announcement) The Gold Exchange yesterday announced that the Ministry of Finance had instructed the office regarding a case. After convening a meeting of brokers, the office submitted a request to the supervisors for instructions. The 15th of this month coincided with the rollover trading, and because approval had not yet been received, all rollover buy-backs were still handled as before. On the 15th at 3:00 PM, the supervisory department issued public letter No. 48, stating that instructions were received from the Shanghai Qian Zi No. 3 directive, stating that the exchange's previous transactions would be allowed to be extended until October 15th to completely settle clearly according to the original agreement, but within this extension period, no new transactions should be made to avoid disputes. From October 16th, the customs gold unit issued by the Central Bank should be used as the standard for delivery. In addition to sending a letter to the Central Bank to disclose the customs gold market price daily, please instruct the exchange to follow the method, etc. In response, the corresponding letter should be followed. In addition to all the regular buy-backs and clear transactions of fixed-term transactions that have already been concluded, fixed-term transactions for December will commence from today, and in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, the Shanghai standard gold price listed by the Central Bank daily will be used as the standard, in addition to submitting a reply for record, this is hereby announced.</p>
<h3 id="e222">New Standard Gold Settlement Price Calculation Method <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The settlement price for December gold futures will be determined based on the London gold bullion price listed by the Central Bank. The exchange has not yet disclosed the calculation method. The simple algorithm for calculating the obtained index is recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Convert the London spot gold listing price to pence, divide by the Shanghai British exchange listing, then multiply by 1.00472, and then multiply by 978 to obtain the standard gold price.</p>
<p>(2) Multiply 1935 by the London pure gold listing price (converted to pence), divide by the Shanghai British exchange, and multiply by 5078 to obtain the standard gold market price.</p>
<p>(3) Multiply 98261 by the London gold price (converted to pence) and divide by the Shanghai British exchange to obtain the standard gold market price.</p>
<p>However, due to China's gold ban and expenses such as shipping and labor, the method has not yet been explicitly specified. The customs gold price listed by the Central Bank on the day can be multiplied by 5078 to obtain the standard gold settlement price.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Major Currency Exchange Rates Rise: British Pound Steady, US Dollar Weakens <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches, the London exchange rate for the British pound recently rose to 125 for spot and 0625 for forward contracts. The US dollar remained unchanged. London spot gold decreased by 1.5 pence. The British pound rose against the US dollar by 25, and the US dollar weakened against the British pound by 25. The US dollar remained unchanged against the French franc, while the British pound gained 2 pounds against the French franc. At the opening of the currency market this morning, the spot selling price was 1 shilling 5 pence for the British pound and 35.5 yuan or 4375 for the US dollar, not significantly different from Saturday noon's closing prices. The market was generally stable at the opening, because the exchange rates quoted by HSBC remained unchanged for both the British pound and US dollar, and the gold market was also quiet. Later, when the gold market reopened, sentiment was unstable, fluctuating from high to low. Banks' appetite for buying decreased, leading to a difficult trading process. Chinese merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, but eventually, the market returned to mediocrity. There was little trading at noon, with no significant changes. The afternoon market opened flat, and then weakened as banks continued to show a strong desire to sell. However, stability was maintained because Bombay telegraphed a decrease of 1 anna and no change. Later, Bombay sent a second telegram reporting a rise of 1 anna and no change, which had little impact. At the close of trading, the spot selling price was 1 shilling 5 pence for the British pound and 35.5 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to Saturday noon's closing prices, the British pound was steady while the US dollar weakened slightly. It was reported that trading was slow throughout the day, the trading process was mediocre, and purchases by Chinese merchants were not strong, with approximately 300,000 yuan worth of US dollars bought. Banks still had an appetite to sell. The day's transaction prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>丨Call Rate Rises to 1.5 Cents丨</p>
<p>In recent days, the demand for silver dollars has increased due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, causing the interbank rate for silver dollars to gradually increase. This situation has created the highest record in nearly two years. However, the main reason is the export of silver last month, which has significantly reduced the reserves, also contributing to this situation. Therefore, the silver dollar interbank market was quite firm yesterday. Both the morning and afternoon markets traded at 1.5 cents, an increase of 2 cents from the previous day. The "toujia shui" (interest added) remained at 3 cents. The transaction volume for interbank bills was over 4.4 million in the morning market and over 200,000 in the afternoon market. The transaction volume at the Small General Association was over 500,000. The total amount of silver dollar collateral transactions, including redemptions and new transactions, was over 2.6 million. Foreign banks collected over 3.7 million in bill payments, over 5.5 million in various remittance cargo collateral and miscellaneous payments, over 1.2 million in telegraphic transfers, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 600,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks collected over 3.9 million in bill payments, over 4.4 million in various remittance cargo collateral and miscellaneous payments, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 1.4 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 1.7 million in special settlements, and over 900,000 in customs duties. Warehouse exits amounted to 800,000. Japanese banks collected over 2.9 million in bill payments, over 6.4 million in various remittance cargo collateral and miscellaneous payments, over 2.6 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 500,000 in warehouse entries. Money shops collected over 36 million in silver dollar drafts, over 7.8 million in silver dollar transfers, retrieved over 800,000 in banknotes, issued over 1.3 million, redeemed over 300,000 in cash, remitted over 700,000 to various locations, received 150,000 from customer sources, and spent 250,000. Furthermore, the total exchange volume at the city's clearing house on the 17th was 12,599,515.29 silver dollars, including 8,047,798.14 silver dollars and 4,551,717.15 silver dollars in remittances.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins fell by 2.5 yuan in the morning market, trading at 832.5 yuan, and slightly recovered to 833 yuan in the afternoon market.

<h3 id="e226">Mutual Restraint Between Bulls and Bears in Securities Market; Bond Market in a Brewing State <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued to show a fluctuating market situation. Initially, with the interbank rate for silver dollars rising to 1.5 cents, many sellers emerged. Due to the approaching settlement date, the supply and demand of chips was somewhat uneven. Both bulls and bears wanted to clear their positions due to their positions, so swap transactions were very active. The trend did not always follow the environment. At the opening in the morning, retail investors sold "layoffs" (裁兵), dropping sharply by 34 to 67 cents. However, the later listings gradually stabilized. After the consolidated salt tax, they rose by 12 to 34 cents, indicating that they did not follow the environment. In the secondary market, the earlier listings were slightly higher, while the later listings were slightly lower, with fluctuations only around 23 cents. The afternoon opening was even more chaotic, with mixed rises and falls. At the closing, there was a slight short covering by retail investors, leading to a uniform rise of 23 cents. The trend was peaceful, with bulls and bears mutually restraining each other. However, the number of outstanding accounts was still large, and this brewing state might not last. As a result, the market price only decreased slightly by 12 cents for near-term "layoffs" (裁兵), while the rest increased by varying amounts from 1 to 4 cents. The total transaction volume was 19,665,000 yuan. The comparison table of the rise and fall results is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm, the New York Stock Exchange was generally stable yesterday, except for US Steel, Allied Chemical and Dye, and Western Union Telegraph. Steel stocks weakened due to unconfirmed rumors that the steel and automobile industries would reduce wages. However, speculators did not believe that US Steel would eliminate its preferred stock dividend. The sharp decline in Allied Chemical and Dye was difficult to explain, possibly due to the impact of the yarn mill strike, causing significant losses in dyes, but this has not been confirmed. Western Union Telegraph was weak due to a sharp drop in profits. The half-day transaction volume was 340,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>|                   | Sept 14 | Sept 15 | Change |</p>

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the market situation remained weak. Because the price of Japanese yarn fell, foreign firms took the opportunity to sell when prices rose, putting pressure on the market. However, there was still strong demand for spot yarn in the southern ports, but it was still difficult to raise the interest of the bulls.</p>
<p>(Foreign firms selling Golden Rooster) The opening of the forward yarn market was characterized by heavy rainfall in the past two days, most people expected cotton prices to rise, resulting in a lack of sellers in the yarn market, and prices rose by 2, 3, 4, and 5 cents for each month. In the afternoon, the cotton market fell, the news about US cotton was not good, Japanese firms sold, and the market suddenly turned weak, with prices falling by 9 cents to 1 yuan in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 46,500 bales. Hengchang sold 2,050 bales, Tongji 700 bales, Dafu 1,650 bales, Daji 1,750 bales, Yuantai 1,200 bales, Dafeng 900 bales, Shenchang 650 bales, and Deji 900 bales.

<p>The cotton market opened with a strong upward trend in the morning, because the weather was very rainy, most people thought that cotton would suffer losses from this heavy rain, and the buying sentiment was stronger, so it rose. However, in the afternoon, the sun came out, the news about US cotton was still not optimistic, and some large households took the opportunity to sell at high prices, so the market turned downwards.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao and Dafu Selling) The opening of the forward cotton market was characterized by bad weather, most people were optimistic, and there was a lack of sellers, so prices rose by 1.5 to 3.5 cents in each month. In the afternoon, the weather turned clear, the sun came out, Dafu sold, the yarn market was not good, and prices fell by 2, 3, and 4 cents in each month.

<p>(No factory demand) The spot cotton sales market was dull, and all factories had no intention of buying. Because US cotton was not good, and the yarn market was falling, they had no intention of buying raw materials for the time being. The sources included 1,200 bales of Yaohua, with prices ranging from 31.8 yuan to 2.4 yuan.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the week, the market was very firm due to the expectation that the US cotton government report would favor the bulls. However, after the report was released, the numbers increased, and the market price suddenly fell with disappointing news coming one after another. As a result, brokers and speculators liquidated in large quantities. Although exporters stood on the buying side, the price was still difficult to recover due to excessive selling. Trading was light during the week due to holidays. There were few foreign shipments, especially to the Far East, and slightly better to Europe. Indian manufacturers did not buy much during the US textile industry strike. The weather report was good. Although there was rain recently, the cotton harvest was still good. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<h3 id="e231">Futures Flour Only Has Hedging Transactions <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market in each month generally showed a circling phenomenon. The quoted price of foreign wheat was 4 points better in Chicago, and 8 points smaller in the distance. Canada was generally 1 to 2 cents smaller. When the price was opened, the market atmosphere in the recent months was flat, and the factory price was not out in the distant future, the people's mind was settled, slightly better about one cent. At present, there is a lot of hedging activity in the transaction, and the actual buying and selling is still light. However, continuous autumn rain may harm farmland, so the people's mind is quite stable. By the afternoon opening, the transaction in each month was still not smooth. The near-term was slightly better due to the slight filling of the floating air. It was slightly more stable. It was heard that a small number of bulls returned in the distant future, falling back by one cent. The future must have a turnaround in the sales market. As a result, this month was better by half a cent, October was better by two and a half cents, November was better by seven and a half cents, December was better by half a cent, January was not moving, and February was small by seven and a half cents.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Futures Wheat Light and Dull <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market, after the opening in the morning, the market in each month was initially stable and then flat. The quoted price of foreign wheat was 4 to 8 points in Chicago, and about 1 to 2 cents smaller in Canada. When the market opened, the outside mind was quite stable due to continuous autumn rain. The opening price of this month was 7 cents, and then it gradually flattened. The transaction in each month in the distant future was light, and the price was better by 1 to 2 cents. By the afternoon opening, the opening price of each month was circling, and the rise and fall were very slight. Because the current flour sales are light, and the famine in each place has become a past event, so there is a shortage of buying and selling inside and outside the industry, and the market is also dull. As a result, this month was better by 2 cents, October was not moving, and November was better by 1 cent. The spot wheat market remained stable, and the buyers were unwilling to loosen too much, and the factory stomach was neither close nor away, so the market also saw a standstill. The opening price of Xuzhou wheat was 3.65 yuan, the opening price of Wuhe wheat was 3.34 yuan, the opening price of Yaowan and Tancheng wheat was 3.63 yuan, and the opening price of exposed tendon wheat was 3.57 yuan, with a total of 5,700 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Rice Market Stable Before the Holiday <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were a total of 14 or 15 sources from various groups (a total of 2,1200 shi), and the market situation could have changed due to the cloudy weather, but the financial impact was significant as the holiday approached, so although people's hearts were on the rise, the market was difficult to show color. Therefore, each thick japonica and late rice market was still flat, and new japonica and new pointed rice were all in a stable state. However, the trend seemed to be more elusive, and the change of the yuan was still not glorious.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 11 or 12 sources from each road in Hexia, and the market's sales of various goods were weak again due to the rainy weather. The market price of white japonica was slightly higher by 1 cent, and the price of middle and sub-grade and new sheep pointed rice was slightly higher by 2 cents. The new and old customer pointed rice was flat and tired, and the old sheep pointed rice was slightly near the corner. The retail price of new japonica in Baiyuan East was not strong, and the price was barely standing. There was a shortage of thin rice goods and no price.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Foreign Guest Indica Rose by 2 Cents <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of foreign guest indica rice was active, and the mainland gang saw a sudden activity due to the continuous heavy rain, fearing damage to the autumn harvest. In addition to the spot rice of more than 2,000 bales, there was also a transaction of 500 bales of foreign rice for the period, and Maruyama also bought 400 tons of western rice for the period. The price of Western Guanzhu in November also rose to 5.2 yuan, calculated by shi, an increase of 234 cents. The price of September has also jumped out of the 5 yuan mark, with a price of 5.05 yuan. Although there are shipments of Siamese and Saigon orders in spot goods, the price has returned to better by 12 cents due to the activity of futures and the increase in the price of guest indica, but the transaction is less than 2,000 bales, mostly handled by the street, while the Zhejiang gang is mainly based on Xiangsha rice, in addition to the more than 3,000 bales of rough rice, the price of guest indica rice has also increased by about 1 to 2 cents. Recently, the spot price of foreign rice has continued to arrive, and the market price can be lower, but most of the previous shipments are received and paid for by each guest gang, so the market turnover is not large, and the market price has risen by 12 cents instead.</p>
<h3 id="e235">The New and Old Soybean Sales Market Is Deserted <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales market for new and old soybeans was deserted, and the market was tired. Yesterday, Chen Huo opened 2 cars of Yingzhou, with a price of 2.81 to 2.8 yuan, which was handled by the mainland. Zhengyangguan bean opened 1 car, with a price of 3.11 yuan and 1 corner. Also opened 1 car from the original head, with a price of 3.7 yuan, which is the stomach of the street, and the market price of the Chinese customs goods is reduced by 1 to 2 cents, and the high beans are also reduced by 5 to 6 cents due to the small number of sales channels. The new beans only opened 150 bales in Jiangbei, and more than 100 bales of Han Kou drought Huang were opened, with a price of 3.3 yuan. The opening price of Jiangbei Gao bean was 5.4 yuan, the middle opened 2 cents, and the market price was tight by 2 to 3 cents.</p>

<p>The current harvest of new Quanzhou dried longans is abundant, but the material has not grown sufficiently due to the lack of rain when it was launched, so large grains are relatively rare, which is a flaw. The first batch of about 2,000 boxes is already on the way, and is expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3 id="e237">The First Batch of New Shantou Cakes Has Been Opened <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of new Shantou orange cakes has been transported to 8 pieces by Anxing Wheel yesterday, and the quality of the goods is still good, and it was opened immediately, with a price of 30 yuan, and the trend is quite popular.</p>

<p>Pingyao Early Silkworms Stop Spinning Silk The autumn silkworms in the villages near Pingyao have not been well-fed this year. The amount of late silkworms fed has increased slightly. The silkworm ants are going well, but the autumn rains have caused the fire to be delayed during the prime leaf period of the early silkworms. A part has already made cocoons on the cluster, but the heavy thunderstorms a few days ago caused the silkworms in the cluster to stop spinning silk when they heard the thunder. The late silkworms in the third sleep are also not in good condition.</p>
<p>Liyang Late Silkworms Suddenly Have Abdominal Diarrhea The farmers in the four villages of Liyang have been economically distressed this year due to the drought and famine, and the feeding of autumn silkworms has been greatly reduced. After the guidance of the instructors to supplement the late silkworms, the hatching and development are still good. The early gang has already set fire and is preparing to cluster. The late silkworms are in the third sleep and are opening leaves. However, the silkworms have eaten rainy leaves due to the continuous heavy rain, and they all have abdominal diarrhea. Occasionally, softening and other diseases have been found, and the silkworm farmers are pessimistic.</p>
<p>Shuang Gong Silk Exported to India Still Not Weak The demand for Shuang Gong silk in India is still strong, and the export is not weak. This time, the British company's ship exported 32 packages of Shuang Gong silk, including Fulun, etc., to Mumbai.</p>
<p>No European and American Silk Electricity Transferred to Shanghai The European and American raw silk markets are trending weak and quiet, with thick inventories and slow sales. The telegrams sent from the Shanghai port to the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries in the middle of last week were not transferred yesterday morning. Foreign banks did not move. Although the domestic silk doors are aware that the autumn cocoon harvest is difficult to hope for, the current silk intake is still light, and the market is depressed. There are no transactions in yellow and white silk. The future is extremely bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Decline in Zhenmei Green Tea Has Not Ended <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenmei green tea of ​​Luzhuang and Tuzhuang has been sluggish for the past two weeks, and the Chinese tea merchants are eager to get rid of their inventories, and the market is difficult to stabilize. Although Yihua, Tianxiang, Tianyu, etc. have slightly telegraphed transactions for Zhenmei from Wuyuan and Tunxi, the cost of sending telegrams and selling is huge, so the opening price of each tea is 5 to 6 yuan lower than before. From the current situation, it is inevitable that the decline will continue, and the price of Gongxi Needle Eyebrow Pearl Tea is also declining.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Piece Goods: Sales Markets of Various Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The opening prices of woolen fabrics for this autumn are 70% to 80% higher than in spring. The main reasons have been recorded in this newspaper before. The best-selling and best-trending goods on the current market are listed below:</p>
<p>National goods: Tight stripes, plain colored art camel velvet, are the best-selling, and imported goods have been reduced by 70% to 80% as a result. Zhanghua, Renli Huangni, Zhanghua riding breeches, Zhanghua Dalong's plain colored serge, Dalong's Yuanchang gray plain Hwate ni Haijing's suit ni, etc., also open a large number every day.</p>
<p>English goods: Suit head flower ni, Yuanging straight tribute ni, mixed color Hwate ni riding breeches, open water meter shami silk tribute and other goods, all sell well.</p>
<p>German goods: Felt ni straight tribute ni Qi ni, sell well, the rest is flat.</p>
<p>French goods: The Orient 300 and 3008 middle serge are the best-selling, occupying the most superior position in the middle serge door. The selling price is transferred according to the size of the franc listing, which is the most rapidly changing goods in the woolen fabric industry.</p>
<p>Japanese goods: Most of them sell well because of their cheap price, but such as suit head ni, although the price is cheap but the quality is too ugly, once suspected of being sewn and washed, it will shorten and change color, so it cannot compete with the goods of England and Germany. However, the plain serge, Hwate ni, and other lower-grade goods of more than three yuan of thin flower ni, etc., that are supplied to the Chinese for clothing are very popular, because their products are very in line with the minds of the Chinese, one is cheap, and the other is beautiful regardless of future good or bad</p>

<p>Two hundred pounds of company iron, recently scarce, have seen soaring prices. Consequently, each box reached as high as twenty-nine yuan. However, overseas goods have arrived in recent days, so the opening price is somewhat softer. Including duties, it accounts for twenty-nine yuan upon entering the customs. Large quantities are being released. It is said that the price per box is twenty-eight yuan and fifty cents. It has been verified that seven to eight hundred boxes were released on the market yesterday, purchased by canning factories.</p>

<p>Chapter Two: Engaging in Business to Enter Civilian Life, Returning to Yongshou, Bidding Farewell, Heavenly Beings Arrive in Chang'an</p>
<p>This made Zhang Jiefu feel a bit embarrassed. It wasn’t good to continue speaking downwards, nor was it good to stop speaking. So, he simply turned his head to look out the window, acting as if he were appreciating the scenery. The car seemed to have reached the top of the plateau, and as they looked ahead, the plateau turned into a plain, stretching out endlessly. In the distance, a red circle appeared, with two roof ridges. The chauffeur in the front seat exclaimed: “Ah! That is the Zhou Mausoleum.” Everyone looked, and the circular line was indeed the newly built red wall, but there wasn't a single green tree to complement the architecture. To the left of the Zhou Mausoleum, there were seven or eight yellow earth houses, serving as the foreground. To the right of the Zhou Mausoleum, dozens of large yellow earth mounds were piled on the plain, presumably ancient tombs, serving as the background. The scenery of the Zhou Mausoleum that everyone had dreamed of before arriving here was completely absent; the scenery they couldn’t have imagined was completely present. While the car was making everyone search for a riddle in their hearts, it continued to speed forward, arriving at the gate of the Zhou Mausoleum's wall. There was a flat area in front of the gate, where about four to five hundred cypress saplings were planted, as if a reforestation movement had taken place here not long ago. However, what was strange was that these cypress saplings were not verdant green but scorched yellow. In front of the nursery, there was a wooden sign, still white and new. The sign read, "National Tree Planting Day and National Tomb Sweeping Commemoration of the Twenty-third Year of the Republic of China." So and so, Dean, so and so, Minister, erected. It hasn't even been two months since Arbor Day, and the saplings are already like this. However, those who came to admire the tomb of King Wen had no time to first notice the saplings outside the gate. What everyone wanted to know was whether there were ancient buildings here. Unexpectedly, after entering the mausoleum gate, they found themselves within a large enclosure, on top of which were three houses resembling temple halls. Although they weren't particularly grand, they looked freshly painted from the outside. (21)</p>
<h3 id="e244">Whose World Is It After All? <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Chongshan</p>
<p>It has been three years in the blink of an eye since the Northeast was lost. Perhaps some have long forgotten the (national crisis), and even if they haven't, perhaps they still don't understand what the Japanese have been doing in the Northeast since September 18th. However, I will now briefly mention some of their construction achievements to provide a comparison for our country. Let's see, whose world is the Northeast today after all?</p>
<p>Before September 18th, the South Manchuria Railway was only 1,129 kilometers long, but now the added railway lines have increased to 3,595 kilometers, more than twice as much as two years ago. At the same time, the capital of the Manchuria Railway Company has also increased from 400 million yuan to 800 million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to the South Manchuria Railway lines, 695 kilometers of new railways have been built.</p>
<p>As for highway construction, as far as what has been completed is concerned, there are already fifty-five roads, totaling 6,800 miles.</p>
<p>In terms of harbors, ports such as Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, as well as Najin, Chongjin, and Unggi, are currently undergoing large-scale repairs or construction.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, 126 new factories have been established, with a total investment of 188.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>As for arsenals, aviation companies, chemical companies, coal mines, iron mines, wool industry, cotton industry, post offices, telegraph offices, all supplies and transportation related to military affairs are being vigorously expanded, improved, and developed there every day.</p>
<p>Oh, how terrible, how terrible!</p>

<p>— (Du Juan)</p>
<p>We tear off the pages of the calendar one by one. Having torn it to today, the two inky black characters "(Eighteen)" jump directly into our eyes. Looking again at the month above, it is glaringly a "(September)" character. Connecting "(September 18th)" together, may I ask what day is this?</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, have you forgotten this day while you are in the midst of singing and dancing? Assuming you haven't forgotten, then how should we grit our teeth, stand firm, and prepare for revenge, erasing this painful and heartbreaking anniversary?</p>
<h3 id="e246">The Day the News Came <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>On the day the news of the violent Japanese bombing of Shenyang City came, everyone seemed to be running madly in the streets, as if the Japanese soldiers had already attacked from Shenyang City to their front. Everyone's hearts were burning, and everyone's blood was boiling. If at that time, someone who was short was walking on the road, they would surely be suspected of being a "Japanese spy" and would be punched!</p>
<p>At that time, I walked to the Baoshan Road area in Zhabei, and I saw that the billboards there were covered with various slogans, such as "(Resist Japanese Goods;)" such as "(Economic Severance;)" such as "(Irreconcilable with Japan;)" such as "(Return Our Rivers and Mountains)"... It was truly dazzling. There were also many more people coming and going than usual, surging back and forth like a tide. Each one was excited, and their faces revealed an expression of indignation, with a great sense of "(Forgetting to eat)."</p>
<p>Alas! Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, today is the third anniversary of "(September 18th)!" I can't help but recall three years ago, when the news came, the people's spirit was so激昂 and generous that it is still vivid in my mind. However, how long has it been? The people's spirit has declined to such an extent! The so-called "(Resist Japanese Goods,)" "(Economic Severance,)" isn't it just deceiving people? The so-called "(Return Our Rivers and Mountains,)" then, please look at the great rivers and mountains of the Northeast today. Whose world is it after all? Alas! What more can be said!</p>

<p>The car came to a complete stop, and the door of the Empress Dowager's car stopped quite appropriately in front of the yellow felt: The Empress Dowager probably went out of the car, contrary to everyone's expectations, because of Yuan Shikai's face, accepting the worship of Yuan Shikai and the officials he led with an inviolable air. Didn't I just say that Yuan Shikai was kneeling in a position that was more prominent than others, so he was almost kowtowing at the Empress Dowager's feet. He kowtowed very respectfully, and according to custom, he also kowtowed to Guangxu. At that time, Guangxu was standing behind the Empress Dowager, his body was very straight, and he had a kind of majesty that was not usually seen. However, the color of his face had disappeared, as white as the face of a dead person. His lips were even whiter to gray, and gray to black, becoming more terrifying than anything else. His eyes were covered with red tendons like bloodshot, as if they were about to spew fire. I can say that I have never seen such an agitated and painful expression on anyone's face. If a doctor were to be found to test the number of beats of his heart, there would surely be an astonishing record discovered. I think that if Guangxu had even a trace of real power at that time, he would not hesitate to make any sacrifice to chop off the head of this famous politician! And the yellow sand that had just been laid would also have a few precious spots of fresh blood staining it. (130)</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>I am in this continuous gloomy wind and bitter rain, and also encountered the painful third anniversary of "(September 18th)." Naturally, I feel an extraordinarily intense change in my psychology. Recalling the trauma of losing land on "(September 18th)," who wouldn't be worried and want to regain our great rivers and mountains in one go? But without adequate preparation, how can this arduous burden be accomplished in one fell swoop? The national crisis has been going on for three years, and the cause of national rejuvenation and national defense construction is still minimal. If we want to resist Japan and avenge our shame, it is close to a dream! During this period of national crisis, it is not helpful for the people of the country to be drunk and dreamy, nor is it helpful to talk about saving the country. Only by waking up together and learning from the French nation after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. In those days, the Treaty of Paris, which was concluded under the city, was more humiliating and humiliating than ours. When the deputies of the two states of (Alsace) and (Lorraine) withdrew from the National Assembly, they shed tears and said: (We are willing to awaken our compatriots and resist the treaty that divides the two states of Alsace and Lorraine. We declare the inviolable rights of the two states of Alsace and Lorraine as our constitution and for our ancestors; we swear to sacrifice everything forever to resist the brutal aggressors)! How passionate and majestic this tragic oath is! After the French were severely stimulated, they worked together to plan the country's rejuvenation. Regardless of any political parties, they abandoned their respective political views and united to hold a national conference in Bordeaux, formulating the Bordeaux Convention to save the current national crisis. The whole country, from top to bottom, worked hard, and finally restored the land, washing away the strange shame and great insult of the treaty under the city.</p>
<p>Countrymen! Can this deep lesson be our example?</p>

<p>Lemons placed separately on salt can last for a long time without drying out.</p>
<p>Mustard powder mixed with burdock and a pinch of salt can make the color last without fading. Furniture made of willow branches can be wiped with salt and water to make it dry and new, and the willow branches can also be straight and not curved. A porcelain bathtub can be washed with salt to restore its original luster.</p>
<p>If there are stains on other porcelain, just wipe it with salt when washing to remove them.</p>
<p>When drinking coffee, add a pinch of salt first for a fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>Where there are snails and slugs, pour a bucket of agricultural salt water to kill the snails and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e251">On the Chinese Typeface (Part 1) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlu</p>
<p>A small piece of lead type carries the mission of displaying meaning and disseminating culture, while grasping these major functions and destinies. Originally, it was often trampled under the feet of typesetting workers, but it is also worthy of national attention and should be given good favor!</p>
<p>At least seventy or eighty years ago (?), Westerners of the Jesus Church, in order to print Chinese books and other items that promoted their doctrine, studied and made Chinese lead type for movable type application, replacing the clumsy, inflexible, and long-unchanging movable type wood type used by the old method of water-brush printing workers inherited from our country. Our dignified and culturally advanced ancient country, all the main weapons for promoting culture, actually achieved such achievements today, thanks to the merits of our Jesus Christ, Amen!</p>
<p>The most natural condition for making lead type is to make it easy to recognize. Then, those tadpole scripts, bronze inscriptions, seal scripts, and official scripts are only enough for experts to use for research and research, and are not suitable for the actual use of the general public. In that period, all official documents, public announcements, and other texts, all containing permanent characters, the calligraphy was commonly used in (Hongwu style), often seen in nameplates of officials, lanterns, announcements, private boundary stone inscriptions, spirit tablets on tribute tables, inscriptions on coffins and heads, and so on. Many places still use it. The glyph of the Hongwu style is flat, the organization is generally thick and thin, and the four dimensions are clear and sparse, so that the legal lines are not mixed; therefore, this typeface was selected and cast into lead type, and it was changed into a square shape for the needs of work. Later, the public became accustomed to this printed typeface, and simply called the printed typeface (lead typeface).</p>
<p>With the rough and simple, it is necessary to advance to the fine and complex position, which is the inevitable course of human evolution. You see, the characters of their own country printed with lead type in various countries in the East and West have many different typefaces, and there are also very pleasing art typefaces, the so-called fancy typefaces, how lively! And in the decades since our country had lead type, it has always used a kind of Hongwu-style lead type, which seems to hold the general principle of (the sky does not change, the type of lead type does not change). Well, we already have lead type to use, and there is nothing inconvenient about it, so let's just forget it. There are many more important issues that need to be addressed. This kind of industrial competition will never happen; this is also a virtue, called (peace).</p>
<p>However, the line of peace is always inevitable to be broken through. Everyone has been seeing this monotonous Hongwu-style lead type print for decades, how can there not be (tiredness after a long time)? Therefore, twenty years ago, Qu Tangding created the so-called (Ju Zhen Imitation Song Type) of lead type to meet the needs of the times. The Hongwu-style lead type was then distinguished and called (Old Song Type), probably because the Hongwu style originated in the Song Dynasty. The Imitation Song Type has two types: long and square. Its delicate brush strokes and uniform rules make people love its elegance and produce pleasure. It is a pity that the owner who made the lead type in this style entrusted only Zhonghua Book Company to act as the printing agent, which was limited and difficult to popularize. I heard that now his family is also recruiting other agents.</p>

<p>Special Issue of Jiuchang National Goods Department Store</p>
<h3 id="e252">September 18th and Jiuchang National Goods Department Store <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Today marks the third anniversary of "(September 18th)." Every time we reach this day, we can't help but feel a lot of sadness and bitterness, and we believe that it is the greatest shame in national history. ("If the four provinces are not recovered first, the strange shame will never be washed away.") Some people say angrily: ("One anniversary, the second anniversary, the third anniversary, all are fantasies. We have lived in fantasy for three years, and the lessons we have learned are enough. Our only way out is to repay eye for eye, tooth for tooth, cannon against cannon, and bomber against bomber. We believe that armed self-defense is the only way to maintain national survival.") This statement is not without reason, but we believe that our only way out, from an economic point of view, is to use paper and needle, without foreign goods, one basin and one bowl, without waiting for foreign demand, to eat in our mouths, to wear on our bodies, not to let foreigners and enemies earn our money. We believe that economic self-defense and national goods saving the country can maintain the nation’s eternal survival. We are holding the Jiuchang National Goods Department Store and publishing this special issue of the National Goods Department Store on this painful "(September 18th)" anniversary, so that all citizens and compatriots across the country will never forget this painful "(September 18th)." Never forgetting to promote national goods is the duty of everyone. Only by promoting national goods can we control the enemy's lifeline, and only by using national goods can we maintain the survival of the Chinese nation. Let us think about how much our market has been destroyed by the enemy in the two tragedies from "(September 18th)" to "(January 28th)"? How much has our sales route been hindered by the enemy? How much has our lifeline been trampled on by the enemy? Therefore, people in our national goods industry are all heartbroken and gnashing their teeth at the commemoration of "(September 18th)," which they will never forget once a year.</p>
<p>The Jiuchang National Goods Temporary Department Store was born on the most enthusiastic promotion of the first anniversary of the "(September 18th)" in the twenty-first year. The leaders of the national goods industry were Fang Yixian, Cai Shengbai, Ren Shigang, Fang Jiange, Chen Jixiang, and Xie Bingru. The factories that joined at that time were China Chemical Industry Society, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Zhonghua Enamel Factory, China First Knitting Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, Sanyou Industrial Society, Shengde Weaving Factory, and Yixin Toothbrush Factory. (Now Sanyou Society has withdrawn and changed to Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Shengde Factory has withdrawn and changed to Yaguang Bakelite Factory.) The address of the department store was originally the Qihua Company on Nanjing Road (now Shanghai National Goods Company). After a long preparation, the only national goods department store on Nanjing Road suddenly appeared. In addition to grief and anger, everyone had unspeakable joy and love for this lovely and comforting national goods. Therefore, the record of business was truly beyond expectation. The staff of the department store were so busy that they did not even have time to rest and eat. Sometimes even the manager had to come out in person. This grand occasion was unprecedented in the national goods department store. Some people even thought it was a pity to be temporary. Therefore, it moved the interests of many leaders in the national goods industry and their determination to establish a national goods company. Although the beginning was small, the impact was great. Now, the Chinese National Goods Company and the Shanghai National Goods Company on Nanjing Road shine on each other, and the grand occasion of business can surpass the Three Companies. When drinking water, one must think of the source, and one cannot but give credit to the Jiuchang National Goods Temporary Department Store. The anniversary of September 18th in the twenty-second year happened to be the year of national goods. The Jiuchang leaders continued their previous efforts and opened at the original site of the Saint George Dance Hall in Jing'an Temple, causing a sensation in Huxi, echoing the grand gathering of the Bathing Buddha Festival. Everyone said that the third anniversary should be held in the central area. This year happens to be the year of women's national goods. With the support of Fang Yixian and Li Kangnian from the Chinese National Goods Company, it will be held in the central China National Goods Company on Nanjing Road. It is so unwavering that the industry cooperation will not come to an end, and the beginning of the industry cooperation (referring to the cosmetics industry exhibition) is also like that. The hope for the future of national goods is truly unlimited. It is said that the Jiuchang authorities and employees have made a lot of efforts in one year, and many products have made significant progress in terms of quality and quantity, which can be compared with imported products. And the Chinese National Goods Company can gather the great achievements of various factories and gain the belief of the society. Try to enter it, and the customers you see are all educated ladies and gentlemen, and enthusiastic patriotic people, all of whom are gritting their teeth and vowing not to use enemy goods again. During this "(September 18th)" anniversary, the old place is revisited, and the feeling of enemy hatred and common hatred is deepened. This kind of significance is so profound and so valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Thinking of Gandhi from (September 18th) <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Tun</p>
<p>When the cannons of "(September 18th)" shattered a corner of our beautiful rivers and mountains, I, a widow who held the concern of national subjugation, happened to be traveling in India, the equally pitiful (weak and large) India. At that time, I naturally couldn't talk about taking up arms to defend the country. I could only point my hair at the northeast wind.</p>
<p>(What method should be used to save the country?) (What weapons should be used to resist the enemy?) Until now, I, like our mass brothers, have not answered this pressing question that is hung on our lips every day.</p>
<p>At that time, it happened that the Indian saint Gandhi was preparing to go to England to attend the Anglo-Indian Round Table Conference. In the open-air mass meeting in Mumbai, I actually saw the national savior with bare chest and bare feet from among the crowd of thousands. At that time, someone asked Mr. Gandhi what clothes he would wear to represent the Indian people to Great Britain. His answer was:</p>
<p>(I want to be exactly like a representative, not adding or subtracting a point. Of course, I cannot dress up like an Englishman to please people. I am a representative of the Indian National Congress. The National Congress is a representative of the half-dead and shivering Indian people, so I do not want to pretend to be the glamorous costumes of the Indian gentry to cover myself. This piece of cage cloth that can barely cover my body is my most appropriate clothing. If the climate in London allows me to do this, I don’t need to add anything outside this cage cloth.)</p>
<p>Later, he did buy a second-class cabin on a British mail ship, and set off from Mumbai with a few pieces of hand-woven tools and plates used in prison. He also brought homespun wool short shirts, turbans, and homemade leather shoes, local sheep's milk, dried dates, and dried grapes. He arrived in London barefoot, receiving a grand welcome and courtesy.</p>
<p>Whether India's independence is successful or not, and what the effect of Gandhi's revolution is, need not be discussed here. However, his personal example of using national goods and rejecting foreignization should be adopted by nations that are in a similar position of being oppressed and economically backward.</p>
<p>The anniversary of "(September 18th)" has arrived again. (What method should we use to avenge our shame?) (What ceremony should we use to commemorate?) Our cannons are inferior to others; our planes are inferior to others; our machines are inferior to others; our industry and commerce are even more inferior to others. Our infant production is still lagging behind, but our extravagant consumption is rising day by day. The blood of the Northeast volunteer soldiers is still red between the white mountains and black waters!</p>
<p>At least, all our people, the people of all levels, old and young, men and women, should universally use national goods to replace wearing sackcloth and filial piety, as a long-term (mental mourning)!</p>
<h3 id="e254">The 918 Incident and National Products <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>The three characters "(September 18th)" taken literally, are merely a combination of three different numbers. However, upon closer examination, it is not so simple. It is indeed an ill-omened term. Recalling the events of September 18th, 1931, in Shenyang, fills one with boundless trauma. Only by understanding China can one grasp the meaning of "(September 18th)," and only as Chinese people, are we deserving of bearing this "(September 18th)."</p>
<p>Since the arrival of "(September 18th)" was so swift, effacing it, I know, is exceedingly difficult! If a person gets a new garment and someone stains it, they are bound to feel extremely displeased. Simultaneously, they will harbor animosity towards that person. This is human nature! Now, upon our beautiful Chinese map, someone has arbitrarily placed a large stain. Yet, we, who are most affected, are less concerned than if our own clothes had been stained. We don't even bother to settle the score. What exactly is the reason for this? Know that clothes are merely a personal possession; the nation is the nation of the masses. From this perspective, it can be said that our weakness of "(selfish self-interest)" is completely exposed. Because one person "(pursues selfish self-interest)" it doesn't matter; if ten or a hundred people "(pursue selfish self-interest)" it also doesn't matter. Thus, the public is entirely "(selfishly self-interested)." Although there may be people who deeply understand the situation, there are too many who engage in selfish pursuits, which truly makes one feel pessimistic. At the same time, there are those who raise their arms and shout, charging forward regardless of the tigers and wolves before them. These are the avengers of "(September 18th)."</p>
<p>The cause of "(September 18th)," I believe, should not be blamed on the interests of others. Others delivered their message early, but we, who love to sleep, never wake up. Consider the repeated invasions, what they have added to us. Remember back in 1915, our intelligent gentlemen created "(Promoting National Products)" – I fundamentally oppose adding the words "(Promoting)" to the concept of national products. It should be "(Using)" instead, that would be correct, because "(Promoting)" is too vague – In the long span of twenty years, have national products truly been promoted? If we had resolutely used only what we needed and abstained from imported goods since 1915, and simultaneously had those with assets cooperate to operate factories, specializing in production, then the results after these twenty years, I believe, would not be less than the Five-Year Plan of Soviet Russia! All of this is due to our general congenital deficiencies and forgetful nature. Therefore, the arrival of "(September 18th)" was not without cause! Repeated great disasters and repeated stimuli, although they sacrificed innocent youth, have brought no practical benefit! "(September 18th)" has certainly become a thing of the past. Now, it has already been three full years. However, unfortunate news continues to arrive one after another. Currently, the market is flooded with substandard goods. Petty vendors and businesses are happy to sell them, and buyers, as long as it's cheap, are happy to buy them. It is said that imports have increased significantly compared to the same month last year. This undoubtedly means that our country's money is flowing out.</p>
<p>The creation of "(September 18th)" was originally the laying of our foundation, and others came to celebrate the completion ceremony. The main reason is that we cannot implement "(using national products)," which led to this. Know that those who can impose aggressive measures upon others are very systematic and organized, not acting rashly. Their minds are so meticulous; their plans are so thorough. We commit the great flaw of being blunt and outspoken, thinking that speaking is the same as doing. No wonder we become a laughingstock!</p>
<p>Conversely, if we all practice "(using national products)," and if a particular national product is still lacking, I would rather not use or eat it, showing such determination and perseverance, wouldn't it be a great pleasure if imported goods were shipped back due to lack of demand?</p>
<p>Do we want to erase the shameful three characters of "(September 18th)"? The only method is: (Implement the use of national products).</p>
<h3 id="e255">The Plight of National Products as Territory Falls and Loses its Markets <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>

<h3 id="e256">The Path to National Salvation <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>What day is today? Today is a day of extreme grief and shame for all our compatriots. Alas! Today is actually the third anniversary of the national crisis of "(September 18th)"!</p>
<p>Alas! The national crisis of "(September 18th)," it is so heartbreaking to speak of! For any Chinese person with a shred of conscience, I think probably no one would not be extremely indignant, right? However, what use is mere indignation after all? The lost territories have still not been recovered, and the compatriots of the Northeast Provinces are still living the life of slaves under the iron heel. The puppet organizations have still not been abolished. The thought of this cannot but cause sorrow to arise in the hearts of the concerned!</p>
<p>"(Save the nation)," "(Save the nation)," this is the unanimous cry from top to bottom throughout the country, but how effective is empty shouting and empty calls? The path to national salvation does not lie in high-sounding talk, but in earnest practice! However, which plan is relatively more beneficial to the nation and the people, and more practically effective in the aspect of national salvation, this perhaps still seems to be a question, right?</p>
<p>In my view, the path to national salvation, besides earnestly promoting national products, I'm afraid there is no other good way. Although saving the nation is a multifaceted matter and requires joint efforts in all aspects, comparatively speaking, promoting national products still occupies a very important position.</p>
<p>Therefore, on this third anniversary of the national crisis of "(September 18th)," the author sincerely tells all consumers that from now on, they must have the idea of only buying national products. He advises all merchants that from now on, they must also have the determination to only sell national products. At the same time, he further advises all national product factories that in terms of production, they must strive for the excellence of the goods, the reduction of costs, and the speed of production. If consumers, promoters, and producers can stand on the same battle line and work together and fight together, then the national product movement in China will have a day of success, and at the same time, there will be hope for reducing the degree of national crisis. This is the sincere prayer of the author on the occasion of the third anniversary of the national crisis of "(September 18th)" and the publication of the special issue of the Nine Factories.</p>

<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>(Ballad of National Products) The moon is especially bright during the Mid-Autumn Festival. A round, bright moon shines on the window frame. Every family offers incense in the courtyard. Snow-white cakes and peaches are neatly arranged. Chang'e in the moon looks down on the world. Seeing the incense smoke swirling, she frowns. This year, the divine land is plagued by chaos and famine. Not knowing the source of the pestilential air and foul smog. Drought demons have arrived in the Jiangzhe region. The crops are withered, with little harvest. Farmers are bankrupt and in extreme distress. The cries of hunger and cold are unbearable to hear. The northeast is about to fall to the enemy. Darkness prevails, with little light. The Yellow River overflows, causing disaster. Houses are swept away, turning the land into a watery realm. Some areas are flooded, while others are arid. Why is Heaven so uneven? Now, in the blink of an eye, the Mid-Autumn Festival arrives. Bills will be sent to every household again. Life is extremely difficult this year. Sadly, all industries are withering. External troubles have not been resolved, and natural disasters arise. How can the people survive? Moreover, the European and American powers are intensifying their armaments. It seems that a major catastrophe is imminent. But the Chinese people should love Chinese goods. Promoting national products is the truth. The Nine Factories Fair is truly lively. The September 18th anniversary is just opening. Everyone comes together to buy. Do not let the rights belong to foreigners. This can also slightly relieve the resentment in your heart.</p>

<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>| Written to commemorate the 918 Incident |</p>
<p>What a vast open space, but the ground is littered with a lot of small stone chips. Originally, this large open space was specially used as an execution ground. I remember that once, thirteen ruthless robbers were beheaded there. Among them, two were truly remarkable fellows. One was beheaded fifteen times, but not only did he not have any marks on his neck, but even the executioner had to be replaced six times, and the executioner's blade was also chipped six times. Another was beheaded eleven times, but they still couldn't behead him. The robber had a smile on his face and was very proud. Later, the executioner greeted him sincerely, and finally managed to tear and chop the two robbers down. This was still a shocking event in the Qing Dynasty. Later, during the Republic, it continued to be used as a place to execute criminals. Generally, people considered that large open space to be an unlucky place, so no one was willing to clean up the remaining bricks and tiles. Unexpectedly, on this day, I don't know why, it was inexplicably crowded with many people, men and women, old and young, I don't know how many. At that time, my watch was exactly three o'clock in the afternoon, not even a minute short. Out of curiosity, I used all my strength to squeeze into the crowd to see what was going on.</p>
<p>Using all the strength of my life, I finally managed to squeeze to the front circle. Who knew that it would have been better not to look. But seeing it aroused my surprise and shock. Actually, the one in the middle was none other than Wang Zirong, the ambitious young man! Only seeing that Wang Zirong, his face flushed, his throat hoarse, was giving a speech there: (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e259">A Brief History of the Nine Factories <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>China Chemical Industrial Works</p>
<p>The naming of the Nine Factories Fair is already well known to all circles. Its motive is to commemorate the September 18th Incident, and it was jointly organized by nine major national product manufacturers in 1932. It truly embodies the spirit of enduring hardship and striving for self-improvement, and it serves as a wake-up call for the people of the country to constantly remember the shame that has yet to be washed away, thereby adding stimulation and enlightenment. This year is the third session held, the shame remains the same, and has even become more intensified! What will the people of the country think about this?</p>
<p>China Chemical Industrial Works is also one of the initiating mainstays of the Nine Factories Fair, supporting and urging it, and striving to do its best. Considering that the company has been working hard for 23 years to promote national products and revitalize industry and commerce as its main purpose, its hard work and management to achieve today's status, competing with imported goods, is not something that can be achieved overnight. Its spirit of perseverance is truly worthy of our respect and example.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company's products can be broadly divided into toothpaste, cosmetics, condiments, mosquito coils, and pharmaceuticals. Each is the first to be researched and manufactured. Therefore, people in the market all praise the "Three Star Brand" products as the "Three Star Old Brand," such as the popularity of Three Star Toothpaste and the excellence of White Jade Cream, which are all praised by people in the community. It is heard that the company has new contributions to cosmetics this year, such as Era Cream, Tianxiang Cream, Soft Fragrant Jade Peony Soap, etc., all of which are cosmetic yarns and products, whose quality is probably not inferior to imported products, and whose prices are far cheaper than imported products. Among the condiments, Guanyin Powder, Wei Sheng, Delicious Monosodium Glutamate, etc., are also sold well in the United States and Southeast Asia. As for Three Star Mosquito Coils, they are sold well both domestically and abroad and are considered unparalleled. Moreover, the company also tries its best to use national products for the raw materials and materials it purchases. Its painstaking efforts are what ordinary national product manufacturers should emulate.</p>
<p>Not forgetting September 18th and only mentioning the Nine Factories Fair, and further linking the Nine Factories Fair to one of its mainstays, the China Chemical Industrial Works, it is not just a matter of praising the company! National salvation and washing away the shame do not originally desire the existence of the shame of September 18th. It is deeply hoped that the Nine Factories Fair will be permanently terminated from the third session onwards. I will offer sincere thanks to each national product factory participating in the Nine Factories Fair.</p>
<p>Meiya Silk Weaving Factory</p>
<p>Chinese silk has always been famous throughout the world, but in recent years, the quality of silkworms has deteriorated day by day, resulting in a gradual decline in production and sales. Since the September 18th Incident, the quantity of raw silk exports has further decreased sharply, and the domestic consumption has also been extremely small. Silk factories and cloth factories have closed down one after another. Farmers have been hoeing mulberry trees and destroying seeds, looking up at the sky and sighing. Everyone knows that this is a major blow to the national economy, and it is a major problem currently facing people's livelihoods. How should it be resolved, then? It cannot be explained in a few words.</p>
<p>Currently, the selling price of domestic silk fabrics has fallen to be similar to that of cloth, and those engaged in the silk industry still cannot achieve the effect of production and sales being equal in proportion. If it is not a loss, it is a closure. There is no day, no time, no place, that is not eagerly hoping for someone to help. The amount of silk produced nationwide is only consumed by one-fifth. The rest is not moved by foreign merchants and is accumulated in the country, resulting in the rural economy becoming increasingly bankrupt, people's purchasing power becoming increasingly weak, and no one paying attention to silk fabrics.</p>
<p>In the past, consumers of silk fabrics in the four northeastern provinces also accounted for a large portion. Since September 18th, this consumption has been taken over by Japanese goods, causing the scope of sales of our silk to shrink day by day. To save the rural villages that have gone bankrupt due to the decline of silk, there is no second way except to try our best to use domestically produced silk. Now that the price of silk is similar to the price of cloth, then using silk cannot be said to be a luxury. So why not use it?</p>
<p>Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, in the autumn of the silk industry's trials and tribulations, with its concentration of talent and capital, therefore upholds its perseverance, is able to support itself alone, and strives to advance courageously and tirelessly, and finally becomes the leader of the national silk weaving industry. All of its products are not only of high quality and low price, but also of many varieties. Recently, in order to commemorate September 18th, it has specially added a large number of products to the September 18th Temporary National Products Fair for sale. Its purpose is to seek the universal use of the people of the country to save the rural villages, and to commemorate the relationship between September 18th and domestic silk, and to encourage itself deeply!</p>
<p>Wuhe Weaving Factory</p>
<p>This factory is a giant in the underwear cotton weaving industry, specializing in the production of Goose Brand underwear. All of its products are of sturdy quality, low prices, and conform to the three principles of being economical, beautiful, and durable. People in the community unanimously praise them and have a good reputation. Here is an introduction to various products for men and women who love to use national products.</p>
<p>In addition to weaving undershirts, tank tops, health shirts and pants, Huhe shirts, spring and autumn shirts and pants, and various kinds of flannel, the factory also introduced a new kind of linen gauze undershirt last year, which is clean, cool, wear-resistant, and washable, and the selling price is low, so it is more than a match for imported goods. Therefore, those who know and those who do not know all take pride in purchasing and using Goose Brand products. This year, the factory also first wove a kind of soft flannel cotton shirt. This shirt has a novel style, is soft and comfortable to wear, and the fineness of the stitching and the beauty of the body make it a top-grade product in underwear. Spring and autumn shirts and Huhe shirts are all suitable clothing for the current cool autumn weather. Therefore, since it was launched on the market, it has been quite popular among young men and women, but the factory leaders are still not satisfied with themselves. They carefully select raw materials, yarn and thread, and strive to improve the engineering and manufacturing, so as to make the products more and more refined. For yarn and thread, if domestic yarn factories have products, they will try their best to find ways to meet the actual needs of (complete national products). On the other hand, they will try their best to keep costs below imported goods to resist the economic aggression of the great powers. At the same time, they will also make the products widely sold, so that the people of our country will know that national product manufacturers can also weave exquisite underwear.</p>
<p>China Enamel Factory</p>
<p>Since the Lifuhe brand of various enamel crying utensils became popular on the market, the enamel products of imported goods have been quite sluggish. Therefore, those who followed suit in the same industry have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, but they soon declined because the successors had no fixed purpose and meticulous methods, resulting in products that were inferior in shape and quality. Therefore, the inventory accumulated and could not be sold.</p>
<p>Lifuhe brand is the trademark of the China Enamel Factory, which is taken from the meaning of sincerity and purity to the extreme, because the crane stands out from the chickens, and is indeed an extraordinary product.</p>
<p>Lifuhe brand's most famous products, such as various European-style washing utensils, sanitary ware, etc., are rare masterpieces in the national enamel industry. The most praised one is the iron box kerosene stove, which has advantages that imported goods do not have. The installed iron box is convenient to carry and beneficial for travel, and it can be welcomed by all walks of life, which is reasonable.</p>
<p>China First Knitting Factory</p>
<p>This factory was established in 1917. The original founder was Mr. Xie Zinan. The main factory is located on Longjiang Road in Yangshupu, and the office is located in Taianfang, Sichuan Road. Initially, it was operated with a small capital. The machinery used internally was all the latest American electric machines, but there were only 24 electric machines, weaving 250 dozen socks per day. At that time, silk glazing, dyeing, etc., had to rely on the assistance of branch factories. After years of expansion and efforts, in addition to expanding the sock weaving department, dyeing department, silk glazing department, box making department, and finishing department, all were added successively, and machines were purchased from European and American countries, so it was able to not rely on other factories, so its products became more and more exquisite, and it has the success of today. Currently, the daily output is more than 3,000 dozen, of which 80% is sold domestically and 20% is sold in Southeast Asia and abroad. The most famous products are Tuanlong brand silk stockings, Tuanlong brand real linen socks, Peacock brand rayon socks, and Chrysanthemum brand mercerized cotton socks. In addition, Yanshou brand and Tiepao brand socks were also popular for a while. The turnover was initially no more than 100,000 yuan per year, and then gradually increased to about 2 million yuan. After September 18th, the northeast market was completely lost. In the January 28th Incident, commerce declined, rural villages went bankrupt, and purchasing power in various places was even worse than before, and the turnover also declined accordingly. The factory leaders thought that the livelihoods of hundreds of workers were worrying, so they tried their best to support it and opened up new markets. The upper and lower levels were united and worked hard to fight, so even in the midst of trials and tribulations, they were still able to support it safely. The turnover this year has therefore improved. It is expected that in one or two years, it may be able to restore the situation before September 18th. The price of goods has been reduced again and again to cater to the psychology of buyers, and the products are required to be exquisite to preserve the original reputation. It is heard that the factory plans to gradually develop various knitted products in the possible period to complete the original intention of the knitting factory and achieve the hope of being the first in China. Therefore, the cause of tomorrow, although half is due to the efforts of the managers, is also half due to the support of patriotic compatriots. Will the future of this factory be smooth?</p>
<p>Huafuli Hat Factory</p>
<p>Huafuli Hat Co., Ltd. was founded in 1918 and is located at No. 50 Hejian Road. The total area of the factory is 45,000 square feet. In order to fundamentally solve the problem, the factory purchases pure quality wool, uses the latest electric motors, self-weaves and self-dyes, and manufactures felt hat embryos, without relying on outsiders, in order to be self-reliant. The products are the Eagle Boat Double Ball trademark. The annual output of felt hats and straw hats reaches more than 400,000 items. The styles are exquisite and the prices are low, which can compete with imported goods. Recently, patriotic compatriots have bought and worn them in groups, and foreigners in general have also praised them for their good quality and low price. It is truly a glorious history in the national felt hat industry.</p>
<p>Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory</p>
<p>Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory was established more than ten years ago. In terms of the dyeing and weaving industry, it can also be said to have a long history. The factory's products are all trademarked with a red star. The intention is very good, because the great light of the red star shines all over the country, that is, wherever the great light of the red star goes, Hongxin cloth also follows.</p>
<p>The only characteristic of Hongxin cloth is that it (never fades) and (the patterns are novel), so it has won the trust of people from all walks of life and is uniformly purchased and used. Whether it is old or young, male or female, all are suitable. It is true that the person in charge of the factory is rich in experience. What kind of material is suitable for the elderly; what kind of material is suitable for children; what kind of material is suitable for old women; what kind of material is suitable for young girls. In this way, its products can win the welcome and trust of the public. The factory currently has more than 300 electric looms and more than 500 workers. The daily output is more than 400 pieces. All major commercial ports in the country have traces of Hongxin never-fading cloth.</p>
<p>The factory's largest special distributor is the cloth department of the China National Products Company of the Shanghai Nanjing Road Continental Commercial Court. Every day, there are dozens of letters from outside the country to the company to purchase Hongxin never-fading cloth.</p>
<p>Yaguang Manufacturing Company</p>
<p>Ebonite utensils have always only been available in foreign goods. The Chinese people buy and use them in groups because of their beautiful shape and because they are not easily broken. Those who leak because of curiosity do not know how many there are.</p>
<p>After Yaguang Manufacturing Company was established, it became famous throughout the country for its ebonite products. The Chinese people deeply felt that the price of foreign goods was high, so they replaced them with Yaguang products. In contrast, the materials of foreign ebonite products were actually below the ebonite utensils produced by Yaguang. The users were in an uproar, secretly lamenting that they were wrong to only admire foreign goods in the past.</p>
<p>After Yaguang's ebonite utensils became popular, there were about a dozen or so companies that quickly caught up. However, Yaguang did not feel discouraged by this. It continued to improve and strive for perfection. Recently, there have also been dozens of kinds of electric jade products, which are crystal clear, like a young girl in her prime. No wonder so many people buy them. It is heard that the company is selling ebonite appliances at special prices to commemorate September 18th, in order to encourage itself with (never forgetting September 18th with every meal) and to warn compatriots.</p>
<p>Yixin Toothbrush Factory</p>
<p>Toothbrush is a necessity for daily use and has a close relationship with hygiene and health. However, in the past, the people in the domestic industry and commerce community considered the matter to be trivial, and few paid attention to it, resulting in a large influx of foreign goods and a large leakage. The owner of the Yixin Toothbrush Factory witnessed this and was heartbroken and worried about it. So he joined forces with like-minded people and raised funds to establish a factory on Huining Road in the Nanshi of this port in 1925. He used new-style machines to start manufacturing. It has been ten years since then. At first, the sales only reached the various ports in the country, and then it reached Southeast Asia and various countries. Wherever there are overseas Chinese, Yixin products are sold. Although the manufacturing is not dare to be said to be excellent, it has been able to gain the enthusiastic promotion of various companies and merchants and the sincere use of people from all walks of life, so that Yixin products have a small place in the national product industry. The factory is truly honored. However, the factory has not dared to be complacent, but has continued to research and improve in order to achieve perfection, so that it can slightly make up for the leakage in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Brief News The China National Products Company (Continental Commercial Court, Nanjing Road), in view of the third anniversary of (September 18th) that has suddenly arrived, must commemorate it.

<h3 id="e260">Rambling Thoughts on September 18th and National Products <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>On this unparalleled national day of remembrance for "(September 18th)," I think all 400 million compatriots, except for infants, have a deep impression. But we Chinese have always had a bad habit of letting things fade with time. As time passes, this impression is faintly forgotten. Just pay attention to the situation of the three anniversaries of "(September 18th)," and you will believe that I am not wrong. When the "(September 18th)" Incident occurred, the whole country was in an uproar, and everyone had the courage to fight to the death. By the second anniversary of "(September 18th)," we only saw slogans of long-term resistance in the newspapers. Now, on the third anniversary, the people's spirit has declined, and they are still singing, dancing, and carrying on as usual. If this continues, I don't know what the situation will be like ten years from now? In fact, patriotism does not require empty talk. For example, when it comes to promoting national products, those who are truly patriotic will always use national products without being persuaded by others. Second-class people will only reluctantly choose national products after being stimulated. The most cold-blooded people will always live on foreign goods, no matter how serious the national crisis is. This is truly what is called "people's hearts are different, each as their face."</p>
<p>Dear compatriots! Look at the international situation, which is so dangerous, and the domestic people's livelihood, which is so difficult; the rural villages, which are so declining; unless they are insane, who would be willing to be a salesperson for foreign goods? Handing over the national treasure to foreigners. Especially in the past two years, the anti-goods movement has completely stopped, and the dumping of × goods is even more terrible than before the national crisis. Just check the figures of × goods imports, and you can know the scattered state of mind of our people and the disregard for shame! I now solemnly inform the people of the country that they should always consider the actual situation after the fall of the four northeastern provinces and the suffering of tens of millions of compatriots who have been brutally ravaged. When spending a penny to buy something, they should first identify the place of origin of the item and immediately make up their mind. If they are still obsessed and recognize the enemy as their father, then they are not human!</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e261">Mrs. He's Family After September 18th <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>Who doesn't know Mrs. He is a brand-new person? Who doesn't know Mrs. He is a social butterfly? On (September 18th), it was precisely the month anniversary of Mrs. He and Mr. He's marriage. The loving couple had just returned from their honeymoon at West Lake, and had just arrived home when they suddenly heard the terrible news. Mr. He was filled with righteous indignation, and Mrs. He's cheeks were wet with fragrant tears. Mrs. He said: "Resisting the enemy is not as good as restraining the enemy. Economic severance is the only way to restrain the enemy. I have always loved being fashionable and bought things very casually, so many people say I have no patriotism. But this time's unprecedented humiliation is unforgettable for me. We are organizing a new family, and from now on, all our clothing and utensils must be domestic products. If there are no domestic products available, we would rather not use them. We have made a family rule that after we have children, each one must absolutely obey." At present, whenever I have free time, I personally go to the homes of relatives and friends to persuade them to unanimously boycott foreign goods. This great principle was said so convincingly that Mr. He nodded in agreement, deeply respecting this virtuous and patriotic new wife. That day, Mrs. He made a plan for the household utensils and clothing items. The next day, Mrs. He personally went to the domestic goods market to purchase them one by one. The washbasins and washing utensils in Mrs. He's home were the Crane Brand washbasins and all enamelware. Mrs. He's cosmetics were produced by the Three Stars Brand, including toothpaste, face powder, perfume, soap, everything complete. The newlyweds wore undershirts during their honeymoon, but soon it turned cool in autumn, so Mrs. He prepared Wuhe Goose Brand autumn shirts and cotton undershirts. The curtains in the new room were made of Hongxin cloth. Mrs. He's clothing included a set each of silk and cloth. The silk was Meiya Qiu Man Crepe, and the cloth was Hongxin Butterfly Wool. Mrs. He's socks were produced by the number one brand in China, Mo Ju (Ink Chrysanthemum) Brand. As Mrs. He was leaving the market, she remembered the cups for household use, so she adopted Yaguang Bakelite cups and basins. The toothbrushes for Mr. He and herself were the new products of Yixin. Suddenly, she thought that the weather was getting cold, and Mr. He was still wearing a straw hat, so she bought Mr. He a Hua Fu wool hat. When she returned home, Mr. He had already come out of his office and stood up to greet her. He saw that Mrs. He had bought a lot of items, and upon closer inspection, none of them were not domestic products, and none of them were not exquisite and inexpensive. Mr. He smiled and said to Mrs. He, "You are really capable, you really have determination, you say what you mean and do what you say. Not to mention that other women would not easily be able to do it, honestly speaking, I would not be able to do what you can." Mrs. He said, "What's so difficult about this? As long as we all have confidence, perseverance, and a persistent spirit, and work together, we will surely see the enemy's collapse in ten or fifteen years." As she spoke, Mrs. He took out a bag of Laiyang pears to honor Mr. He, and Mr. He also took out candy from the China National Goods Company to honor Mrs. He. They ate and talked, admiring the lovely round autumn moon. It is precisely:</p>
<p>Passionate couple with warm hearts, will not rest until the national shame is avenged. If you want to know what happens next, listen to the next installment.</p>
