<h3 id="c35">防止白銀外流之有效辦法 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>│在提高上海銀價│</p>
<p>— 次行</p>
<p>我國經濟學家對於美政府提高銀價之意見。發表於報章雜誌者巳不少。茲文姑置學理上之研究於不論。僅就現銀流出一項而討論之。</p>
<p>我國現銀流出國外之原因。不外下列數種。（一）因對外貿易入超。除華僑匯欵等可以挹注外。不得不藉輸出現銀。以資抵償。（二）遇國家對外信用發生極度動搖時。引起資本逃避。現銀流出國外。（三）海外銀價高於國內。因而引起奸商收買現銀銷售國外之投機行爲。</p>
<p>查近年我國對外貿易情形。巳逐步改善。本年入超數額。尤見减少。政府信用。亦因整理財政。統一稅收。漸臻鞏固。足見此次滬銀外流。全屬上述之第三種原因。而與一二兩種無關。但現時第三種原因。若不設法改正。則將來外幣日高。入超數額。無形增加。現銀源源流出。亦足以發生恐慌。引起資本逃避之虞也。</p>
<p>從來上海銀價。常常稍低於海外。一因中國爲入超之國家。二因釐訂匯價之權。操於外商銀行之手。不過抑低之程度。非常有限。至多比較中英匯兌平價。低0·一二五或0·二五辨士之數。今則不然。如八月一日中英平價。應爲一七·一二五辨士（合國幣一元）。而匯豐銀行掛牌僅掛一六辨士。抑低至一·一二五辨士之多。八月二十一日差額更大。竟達一·八七五辨士。換言之。即八月二十一日於上海市塲購入一個銀元。僅需一先令四辨士三七五之代價。若於同日在倫敦市塲脫售。即可換得一先令六辨士二五之英國貨幣。一轉瞬間。每一銀元可獲利一·八七五辨士。由此類推。則買賣一萬萬元之銀元。即可獲利英金一八七，五00，000辨士。約合華幣一千一百萬元。除去少許之運送雜費等外。即爲純利。利益之大。殊堪驚人。傳聞數大外國銀行。因經營此種賣買。獲利甚鉅。凡經營此種賣買之投機商人。必先設法抑低上海之銀價。使中英平價距離愈遠愈妙。故我國防止現銀流出之有效辦法。即爲提高上海銀價。使與中英匯兌平價相接近。則投機者旣無利可圖。現銀之流失。將不制而自止。若禁銀出口與加徵出口稅等辦法。旣不能立即制止外商銀行之輸運。（如美銀國有對於在美外商銀行之存銀。獨許例外。足見外商銀行之不易應付。）反使上海銀價。去中英匯兌平價愈遠。適中奸商之計。將益引起假借外商銀行運銀出口之投機行爲。其不宜用也可知。然則提高上海銀價之辦法如何。鄙意以爲下列各項。可以採用</p>
<p>一，與美政府接洽。同時在滬購銀││上海銀價旣較倫敦爲廉。則美政府何爲不在上海購銀。此因上海市塲交易比較狹小。常受英日商人操縱。白銀成色。又極複雜而不統一（電傳日前美政府對於滬埠美商。曾有命令。囑將購得之銀。暫存上海。或者亦爲成色之關係。）美政府固不喜我國現銀大量賣出。以破毀倫敦之銀恊定也。我國若能循外交途徑。與美政府接洽。利用彼國匯兌平準基金之一部。在滬買賣白銀。以援助我國維持上海對外銀價之水平綫。不獨可杜絕上海英日銀行之壟斷投機。且可藉以穩定遠東之銀市。查美政府現極重視遠東貿易。不願他國勢力操縱上海金融。此項商談。未始無成立之可能。</p>
<p>二，由中國政府收購現銀。││我國中央銀行所發行之紙幣。尙極有限。將來幣制統一。其他銀行紙幣。逐漸减少。換言之。此後中央銀行所發行之紙幣。當然只有增加之一途。故此時中國政府爲增發紙幣而收買現銀。想不至有虧蝕之虞。萬一將來銀價高漲。更可將此項收買之數。逐步易購現金。充作改取金本位之準備。</p>
<p>三，以中央銀行現有關金之一部分。暫充我國之匯兌平衡基金。││上海銀價。旣因一部分外商銀行之壟斷抑低。致脫離世界銀市而下落。然此種背道而馳之現象。結果雖必終歸平復。但在此短期間內因彼輩之操縱。影響我國對外貿易之損失匪淺。我國政府若能臨時創設匯兌平衡基金。以資抵制。正所以保護正當商人之利益也。</p>
<p>四，中央銀行在白銀輸出有利點以上。拒絕收購黃金。││所謂銀價之漲落。無非金銀比價之高下。金貴則銀賤。金賤則銀貴。故欲提高上海銀價。而從抑低上海金價入手。亦可奏效。中央銀行若能暫時公佈拒絕收購黃金。則市上黃金流轉增多。金價自然低落。銀價自然上漲。而漸達匯兌上之水平綫焉。</p>
<p>五，禁止內地現銀自由流向上海││近年我國農村。瀕於破產。現銀漸次集中都市。而以上海爲最後之尾閭。實爲我國金融經濟上可慮之現象。農村繁榮。則都市之白銀漸次被農村吸收。反之，農村衰頹。則農村之白銀。必流向部市。近年我國農村經濟。旣極不振。白銀由內地流向上海。勢所難免。爲挽救農村之頹勢計。爲防免都市存銀之過剩計。暫時以政治手段。干涉內地現銀自由流向上海。亦爲一種救急之辦法。如最近印度政府禁止內地存銀流向孟買。即其一例。</p>
<p>此外如聯合華商銀行。統制管理存銀。或增加各銀行紙幣之現銀保證額。或勸導人民暫時售出外幣債券。或勸向外商銀行提回大批存欵。或與關係國領事及外商銀行領袖交涉制止等。皆爲平衡銀價防止輸出之有效辦法。其他如救濟內地農村。增加輸出。勸誘華僑或外商來華投資等等。亦均爲平衡我國對外國際貸借之根本方法。總之上列辦法。若一一實行。不獨上海與倫敦間之銀價。將立見平衡。或竟超出於倫敦銀價之上。亦非不可能之事。不過現在白銀外流之現象。旣係一二奸商操縱之結果。則殺雞焉用牛刀。只要我國當局。能如美政府對於其經濟政策。時時宣傳提高上海銀價。從平衡匯兌着想。其效力自必不小也。</p>

<p>（莫斯科）伊斯維斯太報有一社評、題名「事實最爲固執」、其言曰、八月十八日塔斯社以盡量坦蕩之方式、叙述中東路談判之歷史、及其各時期之情形、凡公正人士必能自此得出結論曰、蘇聯爲欲袪除日蘇衝突之源、故願作大量之讓步、同時蘇聯之讓步、又爲該項談判之最後一舉、日本報界深懼此次營業性之語調及其不偏不依之態度、太足徵信、故將塔斯社此項消息秘而不宣、隱瞞讀者、日聯社僅將塔斯社消息作一簡報、將其內容中之一切事實、鄭重刪去、假如日本之國際地位僅賴日本報紙及通訊社之導演左右其手於日本輿論之前、則彼等確能爲日本之政策獲取最輝耀之勝利、</p>
<p>所惜者若干事實彼等雖加隱諱、而舉世固已大白矣、此點吾人僅須一瞥世界各領袖報紙之言論則已足、彼等於評論中東路交涉之中斷時、乃完全同情於蘇聯焉、</p>

<p>「日本恒以蘇聯之不「誠懇」爲憾、吾人實</p>

<p>」現時雙方出價差僅約一千萬元耳、而日本軍閥之報紙、動以攫奪蘇聯財產之鐵路相威脅、由此而「節省」數百萬元之金額、最熱心之日本報界戰士正爲此數額鼓吹戰爭、此際吾人可得一結論曰、此等人物實已全部喪失、其對於實際之感覺、彼等正向全世界輿論暴露其自身、其功效蓋遠非最爲技巧之反日宣傳所能望其項背也、吾人已足表示、全世界大衆之輿論固已了解佔奪他人鐵道以及戰爭危機之意義果爲何如、吾人對於各國國民僅須指明、日本軍閥雖爲一千萬元之金額、卽願引起最深刻之擾亂、彼等必能思索曰、「此事之於日本軍閥、並非千萬元之問題、而爲如何藉口以佔奪他人之鐵路、挑撥世界之亂事之問題也」、此等對於事實罔無所知之人物、僅能信仰其槍刀、以期引起糾紛、故竟能冒天下之不韙、以實行其詭計、</p>
<p>「彼等欲令此種局面之責任、委諸蘇聯、此事將白費力量、蓋全世界巳洞知蘇聯政府之和平政策、及其於遠東方面所表示之鎭靜與忍耐、舉世了解堅持不肯讓步者乃係日滿方面、日本軍閥之報紙於造謠之外復作種種措辭肯定之威脅、此點更能說明日滿對中東路問題之不讓步態度、此等威脅更令舉世所抱之信念趨於堅定、卽日本軍閥冒險家之主要人物、正積極活動、以令全世界着火、同時得逞火完成其數年來寤寐、以求之空想目的」云、（二十二日塔斯電）</p>

<p>漏稅火柴　可見漏稅進口之貨、已漸推漸廣、若無根本防止辦法、非特影響正當商人之營業、抑且於稅收前途、大有妨碍、海關對於此項查獲之漏稅火柴、向係照章拍賣、惟拍賣後、貨仍存在、且因其拍賣價値甚低之故、致正當商人行銷之火柴、難與競爭、未經海關拍賣、固爲查獲之漏稅火柴、旣經海關拍賣、則查獲之漏稅火柴、反得公然行銷、若其統稅係由海關代征、其所征統稅即計入在拍賣價格內、則統稅機關、亦已於無形中向其征收統稅而允准其行銷、是其行銷時更取得一重保障、設查獲之漏稅火柴、其中有一部份係屬冒牌、則何者爲冒牌、何者不爲冒牌、海關未能明瞭其中情形、拍賣時並未將冒牌火柴、剔除、是查獲之漏稅火柴、兼有冒牌行爲者、亦將</p>
<p>公然行銷　無阻、違反法制、侵害營業、莫此爲甚、又按諸已往情形、海關間有知其爲冒牌、其拍賣時係將其冒牌之商標撕去、換貼「頂上火柴」字樣、其用意所在、無非一方避免冒牌、一方仍可藉此拍賣行銷、但偷漏者、以其改貼「頂上火柴」字樣可以行銷、於是相率效尤、將其偷漏火柴之商標、亦一律撕去、改貼「頂上火柴」字樣、以致拍賣之漏稅火柴、與偷漏火柴之未經查獲者、漫無區分、難於辨別、引起統稅查緝上之困難、而偷漏火柴之未經查獲者、乃得因此逍遙法外、益可暢行無阻、此固爲海關初意所未及料、然旣有此種流弊發生、則海關前項之改貼拍賣辦法、即有未盡妥善之處、自有一併糾正之必要、竊謂火柴漏稅進口日見增多、根本上之　　防止方法　萬難置爲緩圖、前奉稅字、第一七八0號鈞批開、由稅務署擬具防止截方案、呈候核辦等因、現在經日已久、尙未擬具實行、擬請鈞部再行令飭、俾根本上之防止方法、早日實現、庶幾商人營業、國家稅收、得兩受其益、至關於海關拍賣須請變更一節、茲詢知稅務署、謂本會前呈、已蒙鈞部發交關務署核辦、關務署曾向稅務署徵詢意見、現稅務署尙未置復等語、是此案至今尙未解决者、其原因或即此、</p>

<p>——答葉蘭圃君關於家族，私有財產及國家的起源，</p>
<p>問：雖然如此，當男女沒有被妻給以教訓之前，這在男子方面還以爲是可能的，（一零零頁）什麼教訓？什麼可能？</p>
<p>答：這是說在一夫一妻制的時候，男子是專制的，男子可以自由的和人「軋姘頭」，女子是不能偷人的，事實上，女子也一樣的和他人通姦，當男子沒有被女子通姦的事實教訓之前，在男子方面還以爲他的專制是可能的。</p>
<p>問：（一零一頁）日耳曼的俗物是指誰？「法國朋友」又是指誰？</p>
<p>答：這是解釋一夫一妻制下妻對夫的支配是反抗的，日耳曼的俗物，和法蘭西的朋友，其解釋請參看該書一零五頁第六行，至一零六頁第九行。</p>
<p>問：爲要達到這個地步，便非把當作社會經濟單位的一夫一妻家族之性質除去不可。（一一一頁）而（一一四頁）上又說：「賣淫消滅了，一夫一妻制不是沒落，將終成爲實現」，這兩段矛盾麼？</p>
<p>答：這兩段並不矛盾，我們知道通在資本主義社會所謂一夫一妻的小家庭，女子往往因經濟不能獨立，事實上總是受着男子的支配，要想達到眞正的男子平等，必須把當作社會經濟單位的一夫一妻「家族之性質」除去不可，並不是除去一夫一妻制。後者是說女子在現社會中是成了商品，男女結婚是採取買賣的形式，賣淫是成了現社會的特產，只有買賣婚和賣淫制消滅了，眞正的一夫一妻制才可以實現。</p>
<p>問：「伊羅Ｅｒｏｓ」（一一六頁）這是什麼？</p>
<p>答：Eｒｏｓ即希蝕神話中戀愛之神。</p>
<p>問：「性愛在牠的本質上旣是排他的一，（一二四頁）這句是承認性愛是排他的了，而本書前面四六頁至四八頁上面所說的話，人類性愛却又不是排他的，反是「無嫉妒的餘地」的。這話豈不是恩格斯的矛盾嗎？</p>
<p>答：動物性生活是排他的，人類也是如此，不過人類的性生活形式是受社會的生產形式所規定，在原始共產社會中，產生了集團婚的形式，資本主義社會的生產需要形式的自由，因此產生基於形式自由的婚姻，所以人類的性愛在本質上雖是排牠的，這種本質是隨着社會生產的發展而實現出來。所以這不是恩氏的矛盾，而是物質的辯證的觀察法。</p>
<p>問：「這是問題的半面…凡是部落以外的事便是法律以外的事。…後來僅因私刑而見緩和」。這三句話是什麼意思？（見一五二頁）。</p>
<p>答：「這是問題的半面」，是指民族社會沒落的一面。「凡部落以外的事，便是律師以外的事」。這是說民族社會時代，部落與部落之間彼此不相往來，所以部落以外事便是法律以外的事。「因私利而見和緩」，這是以前部落與部落遇着了就是戰爭，戰勝的部落總是把戰敗的部落一起殺掉或者充着食物，後來因生產力的發展，戰勝的部落如其把戰敗的部落俘虜完全殺掉，倒不如把他們餋作從事生產的奴隸爲有利。以前的殘酷行爲，就因這種私利而見緩和。</p>
<p>問：部落對於人類無論對自己以及對部落以外的人依然是一種限界，（一五二頁）這句是什麼意思？限界是什麼？</p>
<p>答：在原始社會部落與部落之間是彼此不相往來的，每個部落所崇拜的神或實行的制度，都認爲是神聖不可侵犯的，這些，就成了他們相互間的一種界限。</p>
<p>問：民族由共同的祖先傳來這件事情，已引起「學究的俗物」，如馬克思之許多煩惱了。」（一六零頁）這話怎解？馬克思成了「學究的俗物」了吧？</p>
<p>答：這是思民引用資產階級學者駡馬氏的話，所以「學究的俗物」，是有括弧的。</p>
<p>問：「海賊時代」（二二二頁）是什麼時代？　　答：是指世界沒落Ｖａｌｉｕｐａ詩歌中所描寫的海賊時代。</p>
<p>問：「我們對於美洲，印第安人中，見有此種情形，正與接待客人的義務相同」（二二五頁）這一句好像與上文所說（罰金）一事不連貫，究竟是指的什麼意思？「此種情形」是指那個情形？</p>
<p>答：下一句與上面的「罰金」是兩件事，上面是說明親族間的仇敵關係，下面是說明親族的友愛關係「見有此種情形」，是指搭西佗所記述的「欵待客人如何奉行的風習」的情形。</p>
<p>問：「帕替阿里（二四一頁）是什麼？」</p>
<p>答：要說明這名詞的意思，只要看原書本的這一句話就可以明白，即；「借給年能得勞動生產額六分之一或僅九分之一的與其稱爲佃農，無寗稱爲管理人之帕替阿里」，故帕替阿里，即指那每年僅獲得勞動生產額的六分之一或僅九分之一的人，這種人如稱之爲佃農，無寗稱之爲管理人，帕替阿里即指這被稱爲「管理人」的人。原文爲拉丁文。</p>
<p>問：郭沫若「中國古代社會研究」導論第五頁上說，「以鐵的發明完全破壞了母系民族社會」，今看本書二六一頁二六三頁母系民族的破壞是在野蠻中期，而鐵的發明要到野蠻的上期。這是不是郭氏錯了？</p>
<p>答：這不是郭氏錯了，郭氏說：「鐵的發明完全破壞了母系民族社會」，應當注意完全兩個字，一個社會的崩潰，决不是突於起來的，牠是由漸變而突變「男子在生物方面漸漸佔了中心，母系社會就開始崩潰了，不過是以農業上鐵器的使用，母系社會才達到完全破壞的階段。　　—完—</p>

<h3 id="c206">不要閹割的大衆語 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 仲元</p>
<p>偶然聽得朋友說，汪懋祖先生最近表示了意見，他也贊成大衆語。這好像是「出乎意表之外」的事了’擁護文言最力的汪先生也贊成大衆語！然而研究起來，並不足怪。</p>
<p>「五四」式的白話文出世以前，中國本來有兩種傳播思想意識的工具：一是文言，一是大衆語。文言寫的詩賦策論等等，是給讀書人看的；大衆語造的小調，蘇灘，說書，等等，就給了不通文墨的大衆。兩者一以貫之，都是聖經賢傅的封建思想。那時候的「爲政者」一面以文言取士，一面也「贊成」大衆語的蘇灘，說書，小調，大鼓詞，一類的東西。</p>
<p>但是「新靑年」却要提倡那「德先生」和「賽先生」了，這是大背「聖經賢傳」的，所以「新靑年」就成爲文言派攻擊的目標。雖然陳獨秀的「文學革命論」還是用文言寫的，但林琴南輩並不因其爲「文言」而寬恕之。林琴南先生他們很明白自己要擁護的是什麼。</p>
<p>現在，「五四」式的白話文已經行了十多年了，用這白話文的外衣來裝裹「封建僵尸」的東西也日新月盛了，聖賢之徒似乎可以放心了，然而到底因爲那白話文成爲「不逞之徒」發表思想的唯一的工具，而且社會內部的矛盾又那樣一天一天尖銳化，于是「有心人」像汪先生者不能不「仗義執言」了。汪先生他們也很明白自己所要擁護的是什麼，倘使有人嘵嘵然和汪先生爭辯「文」「白」的優劣，我知汪先生一定要暗笑。</p>
<p>接著是大衆語問題鑼鼓喧天來了。你一拳，我一脚，把白話文抨擊得只配丟在糞坑裏了：這中間，自然大多數是眞心爲了大衆語作先鋒，但也有不少是在那里替文言幹那借刀殺人的勾當。他們的得意之論就是不許大衆語和新的東西接觸，—極端排斥新的口頭語以及新的形式。他們表面上把大衆語視爲神聖，實際上是把牠關在黑房子裏不使牠跟新的接觸而得進步。新的大衆語尙沒產生，他們先想把牠阉割了！試問現在大衆的口頭語倘使沒有多量的代表新思想的新原素加進去，怎麼能够負荷牠在文化上的特殊的使命？所以那些主張「大衆語排斥新東西」的論客是要大衆語停滯在目前的封建的階段；這樣的「大衆語」，無怪汪先生也贊成了。</p>
<p>現在常聽得喊道：「拿出貨色來」！不問這喊聲是好意呢或是惡意，「貨色」是遲早要拿出來的。不過這「貨色」一定不能是大衆口頭語的「拷貝」。牠不能一味遷就大衆的低級的文化水準，牠得提高大衆的文化水準；在消極方面，牠應該剔除那些富有封建意識的大衆口頭語，在積極方面，應該注入新的原素。我們不能把大衆看成了非常愚笨又非常頑固的古所謂「愚民」；大衆是很會學習，很需要學習的，大衆是早已從生活的教訓中知道唾棄舊的，接收新的了。</p>
<h3 id="c207">何必多問 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>每次看見大人裝出兇狠强橫的面孔，揮起籐鞭威嚇無知小孩，一面嘴裏問：「怕不怕，敢不敢」的時候，心裏便毫不感興味地判定道是一種頂拙劣的訓練法。大人是快意的。小孩子還不曾曉得到甚麼地方去聲訴這種虐待，假使房門已鎖，籐條亂下，雖是滿肚子委屈，答話也只好暫時找那在目前有利的一個了。</p>
<p>又如頂蠢笨的馬師騎馬。皮鞭揚起，不問情由地亂打一通，一面嘴裹問：「走不走，走不走，」那麼即使馬性極倔强片刻的勝利仍是一定屬於馬師。</p>
<p>如果平心靜氣一想，大人跟馬師用怕不怕，敢不敢，走不走，這樣的方式去向受逼害者徵求意見，是只能加强他們底怨毒，絲毫沒有益處的。頂多也不過說明大人跟馬師比他們底受治者更缺少理性，而嗜好這麼一種殘暴乖戾的玩弄罷了。</p>
<p>表面上，不管是否出於自願那些「走，怕，不敢」的答案總是被尋獲了，雖然有點兒朦朦朧朧。不過由於這朦朦朧朧，禍根也就深深種下。轉眼之間，小孩子就會把煤油倒在抽屜裏。把尿撒在牀上，而那匹倔强的馬，就能够把牠底乘坐者摔到地上，或扔進亂石巖巉的山壑裏。</p>
<p>最近德國希特勒的命令全國人民投票選舉他做總統，那情形正類此。其實他要當甚麼，要做什麼，自己决定了就行。用不着去問別人，別人一時也來不及，或不能够問他。</p>
<p>但是他要問：「赞成不赞成？」</p>
<p>其實在他統治下所謂選舉，只不過是一個無聊的節目；選舉而只許選一個人，否則該票作廢，那又何必人民多此一舉？然而在這種不生實效的游戲裏，居然有十分之一的選民硬要表示反對的意見，這種现象自然爲希特勒黨人所不滿。所以國社黨正式機關報「攻擊」發表一篇文章，呌做「爲投反對票者進一言」。說贊成希特勒的旣達三千八百萬人，則這少數反對者又焉能爲害，「此無異小兒手撼鐵柱，徒見其不自量也」云云。把七百多萬選民比作一個小孩，這又是一個創見。但這小孩竟能不怕兇狠强橫的面孔，抗聲直說，並以手撼鐵柱，又可以想見他們雖是有反對的意見，却也可見他們愚昧到若何程度了。</p>
<p>某自由文學家曾引莎士比亞底作品證明羣衆永遠是盲目的，我想這手撼鐵柱的七百萬德國人，大可以替他做證人。然則對於盲目的傢伙，德國聖明的領袖又何必多問呢？</p>

<p>— 李斐</p>
<p>人道靑島夏天好，這話眞個兒是不謊人的。</p>
<p>我不去說匯泉海浴，湛山聽濤，公園荷亭，山徑尋幽，那些大地方。我就來說黃昏裏那條臥在前海中長長的棧橋吧，說起來也夠一些異地朋友們羨慕哩。</p>
<p>橋是那麼長，長在海心裏；從頭到末足有半里多，所以也有人呌長碼頭的。新建那碧瓦紅牆迴瀾閣，高踞在橋頭上，遠看去眞像一位長長白衣女郎頭戴着一頂珠鳳冠。潮來時浪花飛上來，飛到橋上遊人們的臉上，無怪一些胆小的孩子們要拉緊大人的衣角哭着嚷：「爸爸！橋要呌牠冲到海底去啦！」</p>
<p>一到院里暮色閃出了蝙蝠翅膀，橋旁白磁燈泡裏洒在橋上的一片銀光，已經被遊人的足跡踏亂了。</p>
<p>橋上有年靑情侶漫步私語，有異國壯士沈醉高歌。然而也有傍着欄杆一雙眸子對着天發愁的年靑人兒。他們該是聽到海裏呦呦的水鳥鳴聲，想念起故鄕家院裏老娘鬢邊的幾綫白髪。看到橫在天頂的淡淡銀漢，懷念着深閨孤燈下那顆年靑娘子的心呵。他們該是在感懷當年躍馬沙塲，城頭拔旗的英雄事業，當聽到了海裏洶湧着的澎湃濤聲。他們或者聽見了遠處飄來幽幽的漁歌，回憶到兒時靑草池塘畔採蓮垂釣，花前明月下小扇撲流螢的小小童心。或者是在悲傷着當日橋頭里喁喁私語，浪花中雙雙打漿的幾些溫存。</p>
<p>這些都是傷心人，留連在棧橋頭上。</p>

<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（一）開頭</p>
<p>聽說今年上海的熱，是六十年來所未有的。白天出去混飯，晚上低頭回家，屋子裏還是熱，並且加上蚊子。這時候，只有門外是天堂。因爲海邊緣故罷，總有些風，用不着揮扇。雖然彼此有些認識，却不常見面的寓在四近的亭子間或擱樓裏的鄰人也都坐出來了，他們有的是店員，有的是書局裏的校對員，有的是製圖工人的好手。大家都已經做得筋疲力盡，歎着苦，但這時總還算有閒的，所以也談閒天。</p>
<p>閒天的範圍也並不小：談旱災，談求雨，談弔膀子，談三寸怪人乾，談洋米，談裸腿，也談古文，談白話，談大衆語。因爲我寫過幾篇白話文，所以關于古文之類他們特別要聽我的話，我也只好特別說的多。這樣的過了兩三夜，才給別的話岔開，也總算談完了。不料過了幾天之後，有幾個還要我寫出來。</p>
<p>他們裏面，有的是因爲我看過幾本古書，所以相信我的，有的是因爲我看過一點洋書，有的又因爲我看古書也看洋書：但有幾位却因此反不相信我，說我是蝙蝠。我說到古文，他就笑道，你不是唐宋八大家，能信麼？我談到大衆語，他又笑道：你又不是勞苦大衆，講什麼海話呢？</p>
<p>這也是眞的，我們講旱災的時候，就講到一位老爺下鄕查災，說有些地方是本可以不成災的，現在成災，是因爲農民懶，不戽水。但一種報上，却記着一個六十老翁，因兒子戽水乏力而死，災象如故，無路可走，自殺了。老爺和鄕下人，意見是眞有這麼的不同的。那麼，我的夜談，恐怕也終不過是一個門外閒人的空話罷了</p>
<p>颶風過後，天氣也凉爽了一些，但我終于照着希望我寫的幾個人的希望，寫出來了，比口語簡單得多，大致却無異，算是抄給我們一流人看的。當時只憑記憶：亂引古書，說話是耳邊風，錯點不打緊，寫在紙上，却使我很躊躇，但自己又苦于沒有原書可對，這只好請讀者隨時指正了。</p>

<p>被請教的人也多是紅着臉，搖着頭，沒有能給他滿足，在白俄之中，知道法文的比英文更多一些。還是一個曾經在皇家音樂院奏演口技的希洛夫，靠了賣藝糊口，流落在歐美許多年，爲他說出來那上面的字。還說着，在美國，曾經遇到過沙夏，他的那條好嗓子爲那些美國人所折服，已經娶了妻，那個女人還是舊俄時代的一個郡主。他是流着眼淚聽着希洛夫說着這些話，他熱情地拉着他的手，希望知道更多一點的事情，他還說如果若是不嫌棄的話，他可以請他喝點渥得加的。可是那個希洛夫却道着謝，說是因爲有另外的約會，便和他告辭了。</p>
<p>當着希洛夫走了之後，他忽然懊悔起來，他想該問明他的住處，因爲是可以再去和他談談關於沙夏的事。他很想多知道一些沙夏的近况，但是他却在料想中能確定地知道了：在前年的晚上沙夏是能喝得爛醉的。</p>
<p>爲這好的信息，他高興着，他幻想着成功的沙夏是多麼快樂，有多少美麗的讚頌在等着他，使得他的精神上有着光輝的裝飾。他的家族，也該爲人注意到了，提到他自己，沙夏就要這樣說。</p>
<p>「我的老祖父，—」</p>
<p>沙夏要用什麼樣的字句來形容他呢？是不是要接下去說着：「一個十足頑固的老頭子呵」！</p>
<p>他這樣想着，就不可忍地煩燥起來，他想着沙夏能這樣說的。在離開他的時候，沙夏不是明明地用「破舊的零園」來說着他的一切麼？那麼不就是很容易說着他也是多麼腐舊的一個人，要永遠把他關閉在那陳敗的環境之中，甚至於不許他自由地喘一口氣。要他成爲十九世紀的少年人，死板板地，從來不知道使他去度着快樂的靑春。——</p>
<p>想到這些，他的眼淚就流下來了，他可以以他的老年來對天發誓，他是那麼受着沙夏的。他比每一個祖父愛着他自己的孫子還要多，但是他可看不過去這個世界，沙夏能明白他麼？能知道他是那麼疼愛他麼？</p>
<p>這麼些天，只是沙夏的影子在他的腦子裏轉。過分的思慮，使他感覺着疲憊了。不是麼，他已經是那麼老了，他就只該靜靜地活着等候末日的來臨。他已經知道了沙夏活得很好，那麼他也可以不必去多想了。只要不帶給他的名子以恥辱，還有什麼要過事愛心的呢？</p>
<p>他緩緩地轉動着身子看着那些堆在地上的，掛在牆上的，塞在木架裏的一切貨品，對他是那麼熟諗的，都像是帶着友好的樣子說給他：「歇歇吧，老爺，我們是都該休息了」</p>
<p>這幾乎是只有他一個人所能聽得懂的語言，他點着頭，摸摸這樣，動動那樣，他的心又感到平和的愉快了。心中想着：「買點肉腸，喝點酒吧！」</p>
<p>外面又黑了下來，夜在一口一口地呑噬着殘餘的白晝，太陽已無力地沉到地的下層去了。</p>

<p>兒童健康營（三）</p>
<p>休息充足　運動太利害了、缺少休息、也不是健康上所希望的、營養、運動之外、莫忘掉休息、黑爾登（Jｏｈｎ　Ｈｉｌｔｏｎ）於一八六六0年寫一本「休息」（Ｒｅｓｔ）的書、說明我們的生長和修補壞去的細胞都在休息時間、自然恢復精神搬運疲倦的毒質也在休息當兒、休息包括睡眠、雷德與梅勒（Ｄｏｎａｌｄ　Ａ．Ｌａｉｒｄ　＆　ＣｈａｒｌｅｓＧ．Ｍｕｌｌｅｒ）合著「睡眠」（Ｓｌｅｅｋ）一書、闡明睡眠的需要、照理小學校的兒童至少該睡十小時以上、然而按諸實際均不充分、兒童好比小貓小狗常常要予以休息的機會、營裏晚八時半就寝、晨六時起身、十一時至十一時四十分休息、飯前一刻聽琴靜息、下午一至三時午睡、四時前一刻聽琴、七時後散步講故事、故事以衛生故事居多、有一次、我講到巴斯德因愛國動機而發明消毒法·治瘋犬咬症·保存葡萄酒蒸熱殺菌法·治羊瘟症接種法、兒童聽得個個興高采烈我覺得象這樣的故事、值得提倡、兒童營最費心思的爲睡眠、起初擬不用女僕、均由導師服務、結果失敗了、現在每個導師住在宿舍內管理六個兒童、夜間復由三個女僕輪流爲兒童蓋被、幹事余庚夜起督察、據調查所得吳淞多瘧故、第四星期起已開始服金鷄納霜預防之、服法每週擇一天、早午晚三餐後各一次、每次一粒、俾减病菌、</p>
<p>衛生習慣　行爲是勝於空談、尤其是衛生、衛生智識、儘量豐富、然而不去實行、有何用處、我們的營中生活完全衛生化、每天欲多量開水、不用人家的手巾、早起早睡、定時進餐…等等、都切切實實照規則做了、但他們發現兒童中有很壞的老習慣、開營時帶進來的、如飯後跳跑、睡在床上看書、不到戶外運動、手指放在嘴裏、不吃靑菜、不肯午睡、衣衫不整、指甲不剪、用手揩眼等一類、於是導師們在二星期內調查出各項弱點、商議了一套標語、分別要的和不要的習慣、極簡單極易辦到的分期張貼實行、復擬就了健康七件事、（一）營養、（二）運動、（三）休息、（四）淸潔、（五）日光、（六）空氣（七）姿勢、在英美兩國姿勢一項歸入運動中、可是這裏兒童姿勢十九惡劣、脊柱骨屈的時候多直的時候少、所以特別提出、以醒耳目、而便改正、這裏我來介紹我們的矯正姿勢操教程於下、</p>

<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>這只有張介夫懂了，他答道：隨便怎樣好，沒有電燈，總是一個缺點。王老五道：下半年火車也就通了。到了那個時候，自然會有電燈。李士廉聽了這話，忽然興奮起來，也忘了他身上有土了。便向張介夫道：我在潼關就想到了一件買賣可做。若是如今就動手，一定可以發財。張介夫聽到說有發財買賣，也就隨着注意起來。問道：你說是什麼生意呢？李士廉道：我在潼關的時候，聽到那裏人說，火車站旁邊，原來是一片空地，自從火車到了，那裏立刻變成了一條街了。這不用說，現在地皮的價錢，要比以前貴上好幾倍。現在趁着火車沒有通，我們趕快在西安火車站附近，買上幾塊地皮，擱下個周年半載，火車到了，那就可以對本對利，我想這個生意，最靠得住了。張介夫道：這件事那個想不到？我有一個朋友，在去年他就買下了好幾千塊錢地皮。李士廉道：在去年就買了，你這朋友眼光眞遠。張介夫還不曾答話呢，那王老五突然挿嘴喊着道：低頭低頭，快些低頭。張李雖然已經聽到他在喊，依然還有些莫明其妙。也不容他們再向什麼地方觀察，這車子早已鑽到一叢柳樹下面。張介夫坐得矮一點，不過是柳樹葉子拂着臉。李士廉大半截身子都在柳樹枝裏面所幸他是倒坐着的，將臉躲開了樹枝，除掉了背上，讓樹枝重重的掛了一下而外，便是那頂由上海戴着不遠千里而來的毡帽，却讓樹枝挑出去好幾十丈遠。李士廉頃刻之間，幾下受傷，倒有些張遑失措。頭上的帽子，雖是挑到很遠去了，自己並不知道（四）</p>
<h3 id="c241">琵琶行與傳奇 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>白樂天的琵琶行，因是詩中絕唱，爲了「同是天涯淪落人，相逢何必曾相識。」狠引了後人的同情。可是這故事的有無，有人懷疑過，洪容齋先自以爲是假託；趙甌北也不信。但是無論如何，這故事是狠簡單的，並且狠平淡的。他明明說是何必曾相識，可見是未曾相識了，偏有三個好事者，虛構許多情節，衍成三部傳奇。</p>
<p>第一部是元馬致遠的靑衫淚，就說彈琵琶的商人婦，是樂天從前相識的倡女，江州再會，破鏡重圓。還替他們造了姓名呌斐興奴；茶商呌劉一郎。</p>
<p>第二部是明顧大典的靑衫記，他覺得靑衫淚把樂天寫成一個風流子弟，有些不合，便裝點出許多曲折來，說斐興奴初意欲嫁樂天，後爲母所逼，不得不改嫁劉一郎。靑衫淚却不然，說斐興奴誤信劉一郎僞傳樂天已死之言，遂屈志相從的。這是提高斐興奴的地位。</p>
<p>第三部是淸蔣藏園的四絃秋，對於靑衫記頗肆攻擊，以爲「命意遣詞，殊傷雅道。」不及靑衫淚。但是四絃秋本身，也未見十分出色處。</p>
<p>明朝人喜歡把宋元雜劇改頭換面衍成南戲，不肯另起爐灶，別闢蹊徑，這是當時的作風。靑衫記，未能免俗，自有可議之處。可是他的故事的構成，還不十分歪曲，還能保存琵琶行的本質的若干部分，像靑衫記四絃秋，差不多全換了本來面目，情節果然合理化了，可是一首徵象意味的浪漫詩，形成了寫實意味的文人故事，無怪江州的琵琶亭，成了白樂天的戀愛紀念品了。</p>

<p>— 朱瘦桐</p>
<p>半夜裏的暴風雨，驚醒了小販王二，他的咳嗽，重又開始的咳得不停。他心想着這幾天，天氣這樣的熱，一天到晚奔個不停，人也當然要疲乏哩。昨天偶然倒在樹陰下面睡了一會，受了一些凉，竟然又引起老毛病發作起來，上了年紀的人，到底是不中用了，王二想到這裏，不禁有點傷感，喉間又咯咯的響了一陣。</p>
<p>王二覺得喉間乾燥，異常的難受，慢慢地坐起身子，在黑暗裏摸索安放在桌子上的茶壺，可憐他頭裏發昏，兩隻脚軟弱得像不能載住上半身的身體一般，那裏再能舉步呢，他只得坐在床沿上長聲嘆氣。</p>
<p>四野裏的鷄聲，呌個不停，天也漸漸地發白，微光投入王二的家裏，照見他一切破舊的東西，照見那隻破木桶裏一粒米也沒有了，也照見躺在竹籃裏，買剩的瓜果。這時候，他沒有懷着自己毀滅的心思，尙想在生存的途上前進，也祇有帶着病軀，同那命運去爭扎，等待獲得的蠅頭般的微利，來安慰自己的口腹。</p>
<p>屋外的雨點，越發下得大了，王二那裏顧得到這些，拖着笨重的腿，一手張着雨傘，一手提了籃子，一步一顚，氣喘喘的對了到村市上路上走去，找尋瓜果的顧主，不多一會，他被雨絲所籠罩着，連影蹤都看不見了。</p>

<p>— 馮仲謀</p>
<p>時屆秋令，夏間伏暑深者，多已發作，或爲秋瘟，或爲瘧疾，或爲痢疾，症狀雖異，原因則一。吾師謝利恒先生，（寓派克路梅福里）治秋瘟伏邪諸症，醫界推爲能手，而治痢尤有獨到之見；常謂痢雖重症，只須手續不亂，不難尅期奏效，所謂手續者，初起宜通，其次宜和，其次宜淸，末期則補，依序施治，總可復原。惟有病家求其速愈，或防其困憊難支，吸鴉片烟以解一時苦痛者，則常致綿延不救。因此症多由暑濕鬱滯於腸曲而成，滯愈多則痛愈劇，惟有滌其垢而通其滯，則病去而痢自止。若服鴉片烟以收澀之，使毒邪益錮閉於二腸之內，無異認賊作子，關門養盜，醫家用藥以逐之，病家用烟以留之，一逐一留，互相抵觸，則毒滯不去而腸壁益易腐壞矣。且痢屬伏暑，藥用滌瀉，胃陰早傷，再以鴉片烟燥之，則飲食不進，轉爲噤口，亦是不救。夫鴉片雖爲毒物，未始不可療病，獨於痢疾則絕然反對，久痢成虛，亦有用粟殻者，然居少數。是以烟客患痢最爲危險，故見平人患痢而反吸烟以苟安目前者，無不苦口勸戒。此謝師數十年之經騐，故治痢常着奇效，今年痢疾獨多，慨流俗常識之缺乏，特作此以告病家。</p>
<p>科學趣談</p>
<h3 id="c246">能醫病能殺人的鐳 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>產量少價値昂　讀過化學的人，都知道鐳Radium或稱銑，是法國大科學家居理夫婦發明的，最近居理夫人已去世了，我們對於鐳，更應當有一個眞切的認識。鐳的數量甚爲稀少，價値却昂貴異常，現在世界上總共祇有五百克蘭姆（Gramme英衡量名），每一克蘭姆値一萬五千英金鎊（一英鎊現合華幣十三四元至十五六元。）全世界的五百克蘭姆，足値七百五十萬英金鎊。內中的六十八克蘭姆是在英國，足値一百萬英金鎊。其中二十一克蘭姆是歸國家委員會管理，凡屬醫學上的研究，商業上的應用，需要鐳，都由此國家委員會平均支配。英國所有的鐳，大部分得之於比屬剛果（Belgian　Congo在菲洲）的欽果洛勃微Chinkolobwe礦中，此礦的產鐳量，有嚴格的管理與限制，使鐳的標準價格永遠維持，不致因產量多而降低，或因產量少而高漲，所以一九三0年出產六十一克蘭姆，而一九三二年便即改少，祗產四十四克蘭姆了。</p>
<p>能醫病能殺人　這樣數量稀少價値昂貴的鐳，在醫學上有極大的權威，可以醫治不少疑難雜症，其中最有效騐的是减輕毒瘤和其他惡性的瘡疾。但是一樣東西有利必有弊，鐳也不能例外。在弊的一方面說，鐳是毒物中之最致命的最危險者。英國大文豪威爾斯（H.G.Wells）腦海中所想像的現代化學戰爭殺人武器中之毒瓦斯，以及致命的毒細菌等，就是「世界戰爭」（"The　War　of　the　Worlds")中惠爾辛的死光（Welloian　dealthray）,遠不及鐳殺害人命的來得秘密難測而效力宏大。有了這樣的新毒物，覺得用砒來毒死人是一種野蠻和原始的方法了。</p>
<p>毒性慢活見鬼　依法萊海李爵士Lord　Lee　of　Fareham的警告，說裝在小小細頸瓶中的一克蘭姆的鐳，足彀去隔了牆壁，殺害你一個住在半分離房屋中的鄰居人；而且殺害之後，毫無痕跡，死者的家人和警署的探員，决不會疑心到你。一兛（一克蘭姆的千分之一）的百分之一的鐳差不多和一喱（英衡量名等於·0六四八克蘭姆）重的沙一般大，吸收到人體中去後，起初並沒有甚麼劇變，也不會感覺不適，但是以後竟會發出可怕的毒性，使人猝斃。美國紐局賽地方，曾有一命案，秘密兇手是鐳。原來有一家製造夜光錶的工廠中，雇用數十名女工，專門教伊們把一種含有極少量鐳的化學品，用刷子來塗在表面上，使表在黑暗中可以發光。伊們所用的刷子，醮了含有鐳的化學品，塗一二次後，常用舌尖來把刷子舐尖，差不多已成習慣了。當時並不覺得怎樣，不料隔了四五年，伊們解職離廠之後，却大禍臨頭了。刷子上剩餘的硫酸鐳，都沈澱到伊們的骨內去了，在骨內它們無孔不入地起了一種內部的轟炸。這種現象在科學上，是著名的最有力之毀滅媒介物。它們有每秒鍾一二000到一八000英里的速率。它們的活動力很有耐久性，即使犧牲者的性命已經完了，它們的活動力，却尙未休止。它們繼續發生效力，至少還可以延長一千七百年咧！而且，極小量的鐳，這樣的吸收入骨後，還可以使犧牲者不論死後或生前，發出放射的光來。據說上述的女子中有一個，最初發覺伊的痛苦，是在看見自己作鬼的時候。原來伊有一次，在黑暗中的鏡子裏，照見伊自己有一種發燐光的反射，換句話說，就是照見伊自己的鬼。上述的女工，因爲受鐳毒而致死的，空竟有多少，不得而知，但依李爵士說，十八個是毫無疑惑的犧牲者，還有三十個是死亡無日了。</p>

<h3 id="c264">談摩登 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 泖郎</p>
<p>時髦和摩登，用法相同，而意義有別。摩登不過現代的意思，所以有摩登大衣，摩登剪髪等等牌號，而時髦二字，出於後漢書，不免有些古老板氣。</p>
<p>本來現在是什麼時代？正是臥薪嘗胆，枕戈待旦的時候，應該實地實動，咬緊牙關，來苦幹一番，談不到什麼摩登和時髦，但現在畢竟是摩登時代。奶奶小姐們，頭腦儘管還在十八世紀，而表面則從摩登剪髮起，一直摩登到月經帶，高跟皮鞋止，無一而不摩登。商業儘管一落千丈萬丈，而摩登的裝璜，五光十色地一天勝過一天，極富麗堂皇之能事；社會經濟，農村經濟，儘管破產，而跳舞塲影戲院游藝塲等等，儘管多多益善地建築起來。此外·········此外·········好在現在只要摩登，其他可以不講。</p>
<p>我國的人，有一種特性，我們那裹土語就呌「一胡蜂。」你看舞台上新到了一位名角，假定登台不過一二星期的話，包你十天前還定不到坐位，小癟三在馬路上打架，或是口角，圍而觀者必定數百人，娘娘小姐在黃包車內翻了一個觔斗，更是一齣絕妙好戲，兩傍觀衆必定大喝其采，大鼓其掌。</p>
<p>一二八之役，忽然傳播自川陣亡消息，花砲店被他們大做其好生意。至於白川究竟陣亡沒有，可以不問；前日月蝕，你也放邊炮，我也放高升，你來敲糞箕，我來敲脚鑼，鬧得一個不亦樂乎，至於月光王菩薩究竟被野月吃去沒有，也可以不問。好在祇要有個名目，自然會有人來和附。</p>
<p>尤其是舶來品，外國貨，最是靠得住，不問其是好是壞，不論是什麼東西，一定可以博萬衆歡迎，决不敢有人道個不字，假定有人發了些疑問，態度有些不如意的話，哼！他們會把義和團同一心理的話來籠罩你，使你開不得口，無怪逆賊鄭孝胥輩，索性投降了日本，專做漢奸的工作，到也喪心病狂，快人快事。我想這種思想，若傳播開來，非但可以亡國，而且滅種有餘，眞是阿彌陀佛。</p>
<h3 id="c265">沙漠之雨 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 國木田獨步著若木譯</p>
<p>駱駝從東之國歸來。住居沙漠的駱駝迎迓它。而問它的東方之奇聞。歸來之駱駝答道：</p>
<p>「東方之國繁殖草木，多住人，不像這里般的寂寞。而且會降着不可思議的雨。」</p>
<p>「雨是什麼東西？」</p>
<p>「雨是從天降下來的水。沒有下雨之先、應有雲的出現。」</p>
<p>「什麼呌做雲？」</p>
<p>「噢！雲！雲！不能用言語來形容的，便呌做雲。」</p>
<p>羣居的駱駝，立的，臥的，都一齊的說：我們必須見識這雲，這雨。祈禱我們的神吧。</p>
<p>於是他們便在等候月亮的出現。！月亮是他們崇敬之神。月亮從東方出現。照耀着萬里的白沙，皎皎有如燦爍的海似的。年老的駱駝向她祈禱。</p>
<p>「我等所尊奉的美麗之神呀！願爾顯示雲，雨這東西給我等。」</p>
<p>雲於是乎悠悠然湧出，雨是蕭蕭的下降。千里萬里，無垠的沙漠，沒有風，蕭蕭的下着雨，這是多麼寂寞的景色呀！悽凉而可悲的景色！</p>
<p>雨連續地落了三日三夜，長天濛濛，日光是看不見了，月亮也看不見了。</p>
<p>最初駱駝之羣是像鑑賞珍品般在眺望着。然而現在已感覺可畏懼，而發出哀鳴的呼聲了。</p>
<p>「神呀！光明之神呀！願爾把雲和雨收了吧！賜我們永遠地住居光明之國！」</p>

<p>有一個十二根指頭和十二根脚趾的；臉盤油得彷彿石膏像的模型；一叢黄粟色的波浪形鬈髪；在這一個境域里，你問誰都知道·他是一個連自己都忘掉丁國籍的流浪者：摩里特而夫基。</p>
<p>他會唱着他自己得意的名歌給你聽│要是你不能聽懂，他更會三次，五次，無數次的唱着；甚至你是煩倦得不欲聽吶，他才抱歉地停了嘴。有時，他會因這樣氣得獨個子哭丁起來！</p>
<p>究竟誰還是不知道他的名歌是動聽到如何程度？不過，他能拉出一手極精巧細緻的手提琴，是實在的事。</p>
<p>他携着他的伴侶│唯一的手提琴跑到東邊，他對那邊的人們要求，他唱一個極動聽的名歌給他們聽！但是結果沒一個爽直的回音說是要聽，或索性攘是不需要聽。</p>
<p>「先生們！我的欲望並不大的，我祗需要一杯咖啡茶的代價儘可以呐！或就給我一杯煮熟的咖啡也好的。」</p>
<p>不過還是沒有人出來答應這麼一個稀薄的要求的代價。</p>
<p>然而他能拉出一手很聆耳的歌曲來是實在的；他是每個人都知道的摩里特而夫基呵！</p>
<p>流浪到西邊，爽直的有人說了：　　「摩里特而夫基，我們不需要聽你這不能使我們聽懂的名歌的！乾脆還是讓你自己聽自己的名歌實在哩。」</p>
<p>帶着幾分的刺骨。</p>
<p>「先生們，就讓我拉一個曲子罷，拿你吃下的半杯咖啡做代價償我！」</p>
<p>「那麼你拉出來吧；其實我們還是不需要聽你歌曲的！」</p>
<p>這半慷慨的年輕人，把這半義務性的條件接下吶！</p>
<p>摩里特而夫基開始運用他那十二個指頭彈出了一曲據說是「別流浪在天下的父親母親和姊妹們」的名歌！</p>
<p>有些人說，這太悽慘了的一回事吧？</p>
<p>？　　？　　？　　？</p>
<p>過了這樣的一個年頭後，摩里特而夫基的名字已不復在一般人記憶里所轉念着了</p>
<p>我們不再會看見有這樣一個石膏像的臉盤：有十二個指頭和十二個脚趾的；有一叢黄粟色的波浪形鬈髮的摩里特而夫基的那個流浪者吶！</p>
<p>據幾番調查的結果，他許是流浪到別另一個境域里去了！說不定是那樣的別了流浪在天下的父親母親和姊妹們吶？甚至到現在，我們不能知道關於他的一些消息來！</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>「唔，那只好看這回打蘸怎麼樣了。」</p>
<p>月亮高高的掛在空間，天是蔚藍色的沒有半片雲塊，這已經是三更的時候了，在這河的兩旁，却還是騷動着。無數赤膊的農夫，老的小的，個個用着勁的踏着水車，他們喘息的呼聲，合着那咿呀咿呀的車聲，雜乱斡混成一片，再也聽不出別的音響了。</p>
<p>老陳雖是一個上了五六十歲年紀的人，但自他的大兒子死後，他也只好拼着老骨頭來帮着他這年紀尙小的孩子工作了，他已有十個晚上沒睡覺，但他只好忍耐着的工作。</p>
<p>「老陳，看這樣月亮天，一點雲都看不見，明天也別想下雨了。」在老陳隔旁水車上的李阿毛，跟悲傷的指着天對老陳說。</p>
<p>「老天爺眞是太與我們作對了，老李，你想，我們活了這一輩子，像這樣的旱天，還有第二次嗎？」老陳也很頹喪的搖着頭回答他的老朋友阿毛。</p>
<p>一陣騷動呼呌的聲音，從河的西邊傳到東邊來了，大家都向着那邊看去了，十嘴八舌的呌問着：「是什麼事呀？」</p>
<p>「又倒了一人了，是阿桂哩」</p>
<p>大家聽了那邊的回答，只嘆了一口氣。繼續他們的工作。</p>
<p>「老陳，你看這樣還成什麼樣子呢？今天就倒了兩個了。」李阿毛說。</p>
<p>「唔」</p>
<p>老陳這時的心裹已經悲悽得再也不能說話了，他想起他大兒子也是這樣死的，眼淚也就吊下来了。</p>
<p>「老陳，別悲傷了吧，凡事都有定數，看看這次的打蘸，明天就七天了，想來天老爺也得開開恩了吧！」</p>
<p>「哼，那才怪呢，這樣的天想他下雨，恐怕再打七七四十九天的蘸，還是沒有雨吧！」老陳的兒子挿嘴的說。</p>
<p>「小孩子懂得什麼？上次不是打了蘸就下雨嗎？」</p>
<p>「是呀！你爸爸的話才對呢？上次打三天就下雨，這次打了七天，還戒屠，天老爺一定會開恩的。」</p>
<p>水車的聲音依然在響着，人的喘息聲也繼續的在綿長着，但是那田野間一條條的裂痕還是存在着。</p>
<p>月亮溜了，東方的天邊已漸漸的變白了，老陳獨自一個的離開了河畔，走上了那乾固的泥路回家去。</p>
<p>他這時頭腦中在一陣陣的作痛，疲倦的踏着沉重的脚步。值是他心裹還在想，想着天老爺會落下幾點雨來。</p>
<p>太陽慢慢地又從山後昇上來，整個的田野又晒着赤熱的光芒了。老陳這時坐在屋子的外面，向着太陽不住的搖着頭，心裏忽又一陣酸痛，淚也吊下來了，他想着他的大兒子的死，和幼兒的操作過勞，秋收的絕望，心裏就不住的跳動了。</p>
<p>午後的時候了。四方八面的人就在傳播老陳的消息了。</p>

<p>— 辛沁</p>
<p>懷着一顆慘痛的心，昏茫而凄亂的拖着沉重酸軟的步調，踏着歸鄕的路程。急忙忙的，又像駭怕向前般，漸漸行近故鄕了。漸近故鄕了，我的萬千的心緒，煎熬更烈了！故鄕的靑山，綠水，和一切的景物，一片一點，沒有唤起我美麗的回憶；詩意葱蘢的景物，只給我一陣陣的黯然傷神，使我浴於碎亂迷朦中。哦，我這個流落的浪人的心喲，怎麼這樣的不安！</p>
<p>火車像飛般，由汕頭駛到潮州。茫然的出了東門，横過湘子橋，踏着沙船浮橋，一步步的，我越行越慢了！已經在望的韓山麓的故校，疾閃過我的腦海。······</p>
<p>我就好像孤零面空寂的，在渡着滔滔的汪洋大海，我不敢想，我不願想，我不能想，只是凄愴而茫亂的拖着遲重的步調。</p>
<p>鄕人來城的告訴我，幾天前公共汽車才給土匪燒了一輛，鄕中在文祠開店的阿湖舍給土匪刦了去，白水湖，大山，許多多的人都逃到城市來。路上已經不平安了。要從這山路經過。那是多危險！但是，我除了更加茫亂之外，只有仍舊是提起疲亂的心神，竭力拖動脚兒，向故鄕的歸途步去。有什麼辦法呢？無情的流浪人，這時竟失却了理智：</p>
<p>「父親在喘着最後的氣，在盼望着隔絕已久的五兒一見，難道我可以遲一刻的歸去麼？······縱然給土匪刦去，我亦只有歸去。······」满懷溢盪着辛酸的情感。</p>
<p>高山巨嶺，曲折的，轉過了尖峰，又是崎嶇峻削的羊腸小徑，一程又一程，走不盡的險道。沿途的景物，故時是十分的熟識：而今，雖然有點依稀彷彿，但這些都是引人傷感的痕迹。故鄕，家破人亡，人事全非了！我連感嘆的心情都没有，只是無限的憔悴痛苦，默默的，掙扎向前。怕今天走不完這難行的路，困在深山荒谷裹，那是多可怕！而且，躭心着土匪的相逢，一路探頭探腦的行幾步，定睛細看幾下。紧咬着牙齒，制止難熬的逼迫。漸漸的，脚是越酸痛，悔恨剛才不乘轎子，怕什麼土匪！</p>
<p>看看四週空寂的高山深谷，荒凉顫心，連鳥聲亦沒有。望着，想着，前面還是多麼遙遠！我的淚咽下肚子裏去。</p>
<p>六十里的山路，只行過了二十里，最高的叢峰重疊的巨嶺，還沒有到來，天便突然陰黑得怕人，雷電在響，我陷，入了不知怎樣是好的狀態。我連乾呌急亦不能，只有趕緊走，但，遙遠的高山深谷是像深無底。</p>
<p>雨，一陣陣不停的下，我全身都是水點在打滾。藻身是冷凉凉的，然而，我終於只有向前摸索。大雨如注的下着，水滴滿在我的臉上流，雷電在震響，山間的水滿了曲徑。從山頂上冲下來的水，險些把我冲倒了！一直到天快黑了，我還是在大雨中爬着山嶺。歸途呵，一直摸到天黑了，才抵家門。</p>
<h3 id="c270">雨天的思緒 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>就這麼一下午，總是把自己開進這又霉又窄的沉悶屋子裹。不說話，也不做事。只把遲鈍的眼光因空地向着屋子的每個角落打量，似乎從那地方，可以發現自己理想中的神秘。而在外面，雨是浙瀝地在下落着。</p>
<p>整天整天都是這樣，從屋子的這頭走到那頭，又從那頭走得回來。正像一個爲單調生活弄得疲倦的籠子裏的獸，雄心，不用說是早已失去了，便是筋骨和皮肉也顯示出可悲的弛散。另一方面咆哮山林時的光景是不會忘却的，過去的生活，縱使是無聊，却也値得神往，道時候！心是爲一種更難堪的苦望所折磨着。</p>
<p>爲什麼要這樣呢？</p>
<p>而思想便更共纏綿地繞上腦際，如葛蔓之繞上靑翠松枝，回憶中儘有可留意的東西，一片葉子，一隻歌，一些壓扁了的丁香和錦葵，一個眼珠子溫柔的顧盼，都像綠酒樣使人陶醉。一夜的失眠，更給人以昏沉的满足。可是那麼斷片的情思，綴不成個整個的印象。</p>
<p>以疲倦的目光投向桌間，昨晚遺落下的東西便像禮物般的呈獻到我眼前。淺淺的酒瓶，破的書，撕碎的花，零碎的無用的電車票子，小碟，碟子裏的香烟灰燼！生命不也如那些灰燼嗎？怪慘白的顏色！</p>
<p>幾天來的沉溺也儘可觀，記得自己是怎樣在夢裏咀咒自己，怎樣在深夜歸來後望到鐵路旁的燈火而流起淚來，怎樣在静夜中想把自己的秘密訴給人聽，而竟不能如願。消耗了那麼多的感傷，却也换來那麼多的經騐。一個沉溺換來一個痛苦，一個痛苦换來一個希望，在疲倦得只剩了喘息的時候，不用說，人是比平時聰明得許多。</p>
<p>可是要這聰明有什麼用？看看外面，依舊是雨沉沉的。</p>
<p>雨遮沒了屋宇，更遮沒了人的幻想，遠的汽笛，騎在料峭的廻風上飄了近來，看到炊烟，知道人們已在静静地用着晚餐。</p>
<p>「飢餓啊！」我是那麼蒼凉無助地喊着：「我飢餓啊！給我些糧食吧！」我像一個乞丐般地向不相識的人們伸出那瘦削可怕的手，我的手顫抖着，我再喊：「我飢餓啊！這糧食是少不了的啊！」可是沒人理會我的聲息，瘋狂的呐喊只贏得空虚的沉默。</p>
<p>糧食是需要的，我已經餓得要發瘋了，給我這個，不是白米，不是麵包，這些可以去牠的思，我要的是使我生存使我滋養的東西。</p>
<p>給我這，否則是！</p>
<p>一個毁滅擲上了世間。</p>
<p>而在外面，雨是不住地下着，我把一顆含有無限希望的頭低垂下來。</p>
<p>我想起了自己，我哭了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>現在我不揣冒昧的把一件很難解决的戀爱問題，要請您代爲設法，先生：您能原諒我不吝的賜教嗎？無論如何總耍請您仍舊在業餘信箱欄內給我一個滿意的答復。</p>
<p>我是一個受過中等教育而剛剛弱冠的靑年，在滬西某一個國貨工廠裏服務已有二年了。今年初春的時候，廠中照例的又招添了一批女工，就在這時，被我發見到其中某一位是我闊別多年的老同學。我們旣是舊雨重逢，當然免不了各道別後的衷曲，在我驚異詰詢之下，她告訴我一年前受了經濟的壓迫，就從此輟學，今年更受不了生活的鞭策，在無可如何之中，不得不鑽進都市裏來實行賣勞力以維持暫時的生計了。</p>
<p>我倆因爲從前就兩心相印的，所以每在公餘之暇，時常同出暢遊談天，終於由友愛而步入情網了。最後我得家長的許可，央媒向她家長接洽，不料事出意外，她家長竟加以拒絕，否則全家的生活費就要靠我來負擔。先生：不景氣的高潮瀰漫到整個中國的現在，創立一個小家庭已經時刻要受到經濟的恐慌，若再加這一副額外的千斤重擔，請問像這窮小子的我，怎能挑得動這副重擔呢？我倆所有一切憇蜜的夢想，到現在可說是完全給那殘酷底事實所粉碎了！不過她經此失望後，差不多每天都是淚痕滿頰的，像瘋痴一樣，並且還這樣對我說：「在這種環境支配之下，我情願抱一世獨身主義」。這些是她對我一種堅决的表示，我當然是很抱同情的。但後來她又說：「不自由，毋寗死。」聽她的語氣是非常消極的，這樣她不是太可憐了嗎？萬一發生了意外，我豈不是害了她嗎？</p>
<p>先生：您能可憐她這個弱女子拯救她嗎？對於我倆這段婚姻還能設法成全嗎？</p>
<p>末了，我還要拿緊要的幾點，來請教先生：</p>
<p>（一）她家長這種要挾手段，在法律是否允許。</p>
<p>（二）她不曾徴得家長同意而自主的婚姻，在法律上能否成立。</p>
<p>（三）女子幾歲能脫離親權。</p>
<p>以上三點，均請先生明以教我，則我倆生當隕首，死當結草。專上敬祝</p>

<p>Practice Street Fighting</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese troops in Tianjin will conduct street fighting exercises in the Japanese Concession at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th, scheduled to end at 4:30 p.m. The scenario involves plainclothes enemies appearing on Suma Street and Fushimi Street within the Japanese Concession, attacking Japanese homes, and setting them on fire.

The enemy relies on the houses and buildings on Suma Street and Fushimi Street as cover, resisting stubbornly. Eventually, with the force of machine gun fire, the enemy is forced back to Akashi Street and Matsushima Street, loses contact, and is surrounded and annihilated.

<p>(Beiping) A person from Yuguan (Shanhaiguan) stated that the British and Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan's South Sea Area had notified the Yuguan Public Security Bureau that they would cease exercises starting on the 22nd of this month. That evening, more than 150 British soldiers, led by a major from Beiping and Tianjin, went to Qin Island. A Japanese military train from Tianjin to Yuguan arrived at Yuguan and transferred to the puppet Fengshan Railway to leave the Pass and head to Jin County. Because the volunteer armies in various places outside the Pass are active, taking advantage of the green crops, the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau has attached armored cars to each train or dispatched armored trains to clear the tracks due to the train robbery that occurred in Suizhong a few days ago. The inspections on the train passing from Yuguan to Qiansuo Station are very strict. Bandits have been discovered near Yuguan overnight, and gunfire has continued throughout the night. Many residents have fled to Beiping and Tianjin to take refuge. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A certain unit of puppet troops near Yuguan was disbanded and partially disarmed by the Japanese army on the night of the 21st. The disbanded puppet troops joined the bandits, causing widespread disturbances and approaching Linyu County. On the night of the 22nd, they robbed the four suburbs of Linyu. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese immediately closed the four gates of Linyu County that night and conducted strict searches of pedestrians. As a result, the city was not robbed, but the losses outside the city are unknown. The volunteer army of Liu Zhendong has occupied Waiboshan and is fighting fiercely with the puppet army. After the Japanese instructor in Chaoyang shot and killed the head of the local militia, triggering a major battle, the puppet army suffered more than a hundred casualties.

<p>(Tianjin) Four Russian shallow-draft gunboats have appeared on Xingkai Lake. Due to the increase in Japanese and puppet troops in Mishan in the puppet territory, the Soviet Union feels threatened, so it sent gunboats to monitor the situation. On the 19th, two Japanese aircraft flew over the lake to reconnoiter the movements of the Russian ships for about a quarter of an hour before flying away. Rumors of a Japanese-Russian war have filled Northern Manchuria. Volunteer armies everywhere are taking the opportunity to become active. Zhao Shangzhi, Li Jiujiang, Wang Delin, and Kong Xianwu are all gathering towards the eastern Jilin area, taking joint action, causing extreme tension on the Chinese Eastern Railway Haman Line. On the 18th, Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Huachuan suddenly advanced towards Mishan, Hulin, and Raohe.

<p>Talks About Weihaiwei and Qingdao Municipal Administration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mayor Shi Ying of Nanjing arrived in Nanjing from Jinan on the morning of the 23rd. At 10:00 a.m., he went to the Municipal Government to work, met with the Secretary-General and the heads of various bureaus, and inquired about everything. He also reported to the Executive Yuan for cancellation of his leave. Shi said that after this month of recuperation, his old illness had healed. Commissioner Xu Dongfan of Weihaiwei is promoting fruit planting and improving fisheries. Weihaiwei's transportation has always been inconvenient. Recently, with the assistance of the central government, a wharf is being built, and the prospects for municipal administration are promising. He stayed in Qingdao for two days and also investigated municipal construction and rural autonomy. The most admirable thing is the development of rural education and social economy throughout the city. There are more than 30 elementary schools in Licun Education alone, and the development level of each school is very balanced. The same is true for other places. As for the social economy, such as civilian lending, improved crops and animal husbandry, or state-owned enterprises building water conservancy projects and rewarding fruit planting, the city's monthly expenditure currently reaches more than 400,000 yuan, and there are no harsh taxes or donations, and it is entirely legitimate income. The fifth wharf currently under construction requires more than 10 million yuan in funding. This time, most of it was levied from fishermen, and the interests of the fishermen were also taken into account. This kind of money is kept by local impartial citizens, and the credit is established, making it easy to collect money. Another point that is unmatched in various places is that Qingdao is a summer resort. This summer, the city absorbed more than 10 million yuan in consumption by foreigners, which indirectly greatly benefited municipal finances. When he passed through Jinan, he learned a little about the economic situation in Shandong. Statistics show that in the past, Shandong Province needed 70 million yuan worth of Japanese yarn, 20 million yuan worth of cigarettes, and 10 million yuan worth of foreign oil every year. These three items alone have reached 100 million yuan. If other foreign goods are added, the number will be even more astonishing. Chairman Han has recently made considerable achievements in establishing yarn factories and managing tobacco and fruit, and other larger industries. In a few years, he should be able to recover a lot of the lost wealth. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>To Develop Ferry Transportation</p>
<p>The Two Railways Are Now Reorganizing Wheels and Soliciting Business</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways believes that the ferry service has already increased its running time and exerted its transportation capacity. However, freight cars on the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Jingshu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railways should be reorganized so that they can all carry goods across the river. Currently, only about 200 vehicles on the Jinpu Railway meet the conditions for crossing the river, and the rest are damaged due to wind brakes. On the Jingshu Railway, only about 100 vehicles meet the conditions, and the rest have weak springs or low car hooks. Therefore, it has ordered the two bureaus to reorganize them separately to ensure that they can all meet the conditions for ferry across the river and carry goods across the river to relieve the accumulated joint transport goods along the lines. At the same time, it has ordered the Jingshu Railway to solicit more joint transport goods to the north to avoid empty return trips for northbound freight cars, and ordered the Jinpu Railway to load as much coal as possible so that the ferry can avoid being wasted. It has set a deadline of ten days to properly formulate methods for implementation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>Completed Inspection of River Works</p>
<p>Returned to Jinan Last Night</p>
<p>(Jinan) The water from the breach at Changyuan has now reached the area between Shou Zhang and Yanggu, about one chi (approx. 33 cm) deep and 20-30 zhang (approx. 66-100 meters) wide. Very few fields and crops have been flooded. The Zhenghe (Yellow River) and the San You (three tributaries) are all rising. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Bureau, went to inspect the Gao Di Kou in the border area between Hebei and Shandong. Today, Han came east along the north bank of the Yellow River from Fan County to inspect the river works. Villagers, fearing that the crops in the river滩地(tan di, riverside land) would be flooded by the water from the breach, harvested them even though they were not yet ripe. Han got out of the car along the way to dissuade them, telling them that the water was not strong. At noon, he arrived in Shou Zhang City to inspect, call the roll of public officials, and give a speech to the people. At Shenshi (3-5 pm), he arrived in Qihe, and the roll call, inspection, and speech were the same as before. At Xu Shi (7-9 pm), he arrived in Jinan. Han said that this time, he was specifically inspecting the politics of the counties with river works and did not have time to look closely. Generally speaking, Boping is better. In view of the fact that future politics and autonomy must start from the countryside, he is determined to use all his strength to develop the Rural Construction Research Institute. If time permits, he aims to train 500 cadres in five years to promote rural construction throughout the province. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>│Increasing the Price of Silver in Shanghai│</p>
<p>— Second Installment</p>
<p>The opinions of Chinese economists on the US government's increase in the price of silver have been published in numerous newspapers and magazines. This article will set aside theoretical research and focus solely on discussing the issue of silver outflow.</p>
<p>The reasons for the outflow of silver from China are nothing more than the following: (1) A trade deficit, which, apart from remittances from overseas Chinese, must be compensated for by exporting silver. (2) Extreme fluctuations in the nation's external credit, causing capital flight and the outflow of silver. (3) Overseas silver prices are higher than domestic prices, leading to speculative activities by unscrupulous merchants who buy silver domestically and sell it abroad.</p>
<p>In recent years, China's foreign trade situation has gradually improved, and the trade deficit has decreased significantly this year. Government credit has also gradually become more solid due to fiscal consolidation and unified tax collection. This suggests that the current outflow of silver from Shanghai is entirely due to the third reason mentioned above and is unrelated to the first two. However, if the third reason is not addressed, foreign exchange rates will continue to rise, the trade deficit will increase invisibly, and the continuous outflow of silver may cause panic and capital flight.</p>
<p>Historically, the price of silver in Shanghai has often been slightly lower than overseas due to China's trade deficit and the control of exchange rates by foreign banks. However, the extent of the depression was very limited, at most 0.125 or 0.25 pence lower than the central-English exchange parity. This is no longer the case. For example, on August 1, the central-English parity should have been 17.125 pence (equivalent to one national currency unit), but HSBC's posted rate was only 16 pence, a reduction of as much as 1.125 pence. On August 21, the difference was even greater, reaching 1.875 pence. In other words, on August 21, purchasing one silver dollar on the Shanghai market would cost only one shilling four pence three seventy-fifths. If sold on the London market on the same day, it could be exchanged for one shilling six pence twenty-five of British currency. In an instant, a profit of 1.875 pence could be made on each silver dollar. Extrapolating from this, a profit of British currency 187,500,000 pence, approximately 11 million Chinese dollars, could be made from buying and selling 10 million silver dollars. After deducting a small amount for shipping costs and miscellaneous expenses, the net profit would be substantial. It is rumored that several major foreign banks have made huge profits from this kind of trading. Speculators engaged in this type of trading must first find ways to depress the price of silver in Shanghai, making the distance from the central-English parity as far as possible. Therefore, the effective measure to prevent the outflow of silver from China is to increase the price of silver in Shanghai, bringing it closer to the central-English exchange parity. If speculators have no profit to gain, the loss of silver will stop naturally. Measures such as prohibiting the export of silver and levying export taxes cannot immediately stop the transport of foreign banks (as the US Bank has made an exception for the silver deposits of foreign banks in the United States, showing that foreign banks are not easily dealt with), and will further distance Shanghai's silver price from the central-English exchange parity, playing into the hands of unscrupulous merchants and causing speculative activities through foreign banks to export silver. Therefore, it is known that it is inappropriate to use these methods. So how can the price of silver in Shanghai be increased? I believe that the following measures can be adopted:</p>
<p>1. Contact the US government and simultaneously purchase silver in Shanghai. ││ Since the price of silver in Shanghai is lower than in London, why doesn't the US government purchase silver in Shanghai? This is because the Shanghai market is relatively small and often manipulated by British and Japanese merchants. The fineness of silver is also extremely complex and not uniform (a telegraph indicated that the US government had recently ordered US merchants in Shanghai to temporarily store the silver they purchased in Shanghai, perhaps due to fineness considerations). The US government certainly does not want to see a large amount of silver sold from China, destroying the London silver agreement. If China can contact the US government through diplomatic channels and use a portion of its exchange equalization fund to buy and sell silver in Shanghai, supporting the level of Shanghai's external silver prices, it can not only prevent the monopoly speculation of British and Japanese banks in Shanghai but also stabilize the silver market in the Far East. The US government now attaches great importance to trade in the Far East and does not want other countries to control Shanghai's finances. This negotiation may be successful.</p>
<p>2. The Chinese government should purchase silver. ││ The banknotes issued by China's central bank are still very limited. In the future, when the currency system is unified, the banknotes of other banks will gradually decrease. In other words, the banknotes issued by the central bank will only increase in the future. Therefore, the Chinese government's purchase of silver to increase the issuance of banknotes should not result in losses. In the event that the price of silver rises in the future, this purchase can be gradually converted into cash as preparation for adopting the gold standard.</p>
<p>3. A portion of the customs duties currently held by the central bank can be temporarily used as China's exchange equalization fund. ││ The price of silver in Shanghai has deviated from the world silver market and fallen due to the monopoly and suppression by some foreign banks. Although this phenomenon of running counter to the trend will eventually return to equilibrium, the losses to China's foreign trade during this short period due to their manipulation are considerable. If the Chinese government can temporarily establish an exchange equalization fund to counteract this, it will protect the interests of legitimate merchants.</p>
<p>4. The central bank should refuse to purchase gold above the favorable point of silver export. ││ The so-called rise and fall of silver prices is nothing more than the level of the gold-silver ratio. If gold is expensive, silver is cheap. If gold is cheap, silver is expensive. Therefore, lowering the price of gold in Shanghai can also be effective in raising the price of silver in Shanghai. If the central bank can temporarily announce that it will refuse to purchase gold, the circulation of gold on the market will increase, the price of gold will naturally fall, and the price of silver will naturally rise, gradually reaching the exchange parity level.</p>
<p>5. Prohibit the free flow of silver from the mainland to Shanghai. ││ In recent years, China's rural areas have been on the verge of bankruptcy, and silver has gradually concentrated in cities, with Shanghai being the final destination, which is a worrying phenomenon for China's financial economy. If rural areas prosper, silver in cities will gradually be absorbed by rural areas. Conversely, if rural areas decline, silver in rural areas will inevitably flow to cities. As China's rural economy has been extremely depressed in recent years, the flow of silver from the mainland to Shanghai is inevitable. In order to reverse the decline of rural areas and prevent the surplus of silver in cities, temporarily intervening in the free flow of silver from the mainland to Shanghai through political means is also an emergency measure. The recent prohibition by the Indian government on the flow of silver from the mainland to Mumbai is one example.</p>
<p>In addition, measures such as uniting Chinese banks to manage silver deposits, increasing the silver guarantee amount for banknotes of various banks, persuading people to temporarily sell foreign currency bonds, persuading them to withdraw large deposits from foreign banks, and negotiating with consuls of related countries and leaders of foreign banks to stop the outflow of silver are all effective measures to balance silver prices and prevent export. Other measures, such as providing relief to rural areas in the mainland, increasing exports, and encouraging overseas Chinese or foreign businesses to invest in China, are also fundamental methods for balancing China's external international lending. Overall, if the above measures are implemented one by one, it is not impossible for the price of silver between Shanghai and London to be balanced immediately or even exceed the price of silver in London. However, the current phenomenon of silver outflow is the result of manipulation by a few unscrupulous merchants, so there is no need to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. As long as the Chinese authorities can promote the increase in the price of silver in Shanghai from the perspective of balancing exchange rates, as the US government does for its economic policies, its effect will inevitably be significant.</p>

<p>US Fleet Returns to the Pacific</p>
<p>From Alaska in the North to Australia in the South</p>
<p>Naval Air Force Actively Prepares for War</p>
<p>Shipbuilding Program Expedited</p>
<p>To Back Up the Sea Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) All of the United States Navy's sentinel fleets have been transferred to the Pacific "until the situation changes." Navy officials have confirmed this order, so today everyone believes that the Pacific will be the center of large-scale US naval activity in recent years. However, the Navy Department refuses to state what it means by "situation." It probably refers to the tense situation in the Far East. The entire US fleet was concentrated in the Pacific two years ago. In light of today's order, it is even more evident that the US Navy's transfer to the Atlantic this year was only temporary. The entire fleet will return to the Pacific in mid-October. During these two or three months while the fleet was in the Atlantic, there was still various activity in the Pacific. From Alaska to Australia, the Navy Department has continuously conducted various tests and exercises. President Roosevelt's personal cruise to Honolulu has attracted worldwide attention and is one of these activities. In addition, there are various other activities in the Pacific as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The newest heavy cruiser, USS Astoria, sailed to Australia in the westernmost part of the Pacific and expressed goodwill towards Australia.</p>
<p>(2) Naval experts plan to fly naval aircraft to Honolulu, Guam, and Samoa.</p>
<p>(3) A squadron of cruisers sailed from San Diego to Alaska, folded to Honolulu, and then sailed back, making a triangular cruise.</p>
<p>(4) Naval aircraft conducted a detailed survey of the Aleutian Islands northwest of Dutch Harbor.</p>
<p>(5) The highest naval authorities plan to conduct full naval exercises in Alaska next summer.</p>
<p>(6) The large aircraft Macon completed its 2,000-mile sea flight.</p>
<p>(7) Naval aircraft secretly flew from Honolulu to the Midway Islands, testing landings and conducting reconnaissance flights.</p>
<p>(8) The survey ship USS Argo led ships to survey the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>(9) The warship USS Ramapo traveled to and from the northern Pacific eight times, measuring depths in various locations.</p>
<p>(10) The Navy plans to build more air bases along the Pacific coast and the Pacific side of the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>(11) Army bombers surveyed Alaska and planned to fly to the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>Naval experts say that this kind of action is common in other naval countries and may not attract attention. Because the United States has not held such events for many years, it seems unusual. (National News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The government has signed contracts for 24 warships, with construction to begin within six months. Naval shipyards across the country are preparing to start work quickly today. There are currently 44 warships under construction, eight of which can be completed by the end of this year. Adding this time's 24 ships together, the total is 66. Before long, there will be continued increases. The current US shipbuilding program aims to reach the limit permitted by the Washington Treaty in the shortest possible time. For several years, the United States has fallen to third place in several types of ships. However, the world situation has recently been unstable, and there have been treaty violations everywhere, so the United States is also taking precautions. President Roosevelt was also formerly the Secretary of the Navy and has been advocating for the Navy to have adequate strength. Observers believe that next year's naval conference will also be very important, because only with consolidated strength can the United States negotiate with confidence with Japan, Britain, and other naval powers. However, even at the current rate of construction, the United States will still be short of the limit by 84 ships when the naval treaty expires in 1936. This is because 78 more ships can be built in addition to the current construction program. Of the 24 ships now under construction, six will not be completed until 1937. Britain also has 44 ships yet to be built, while Japan has only one ship left. The contracts signed by the US Secretary of the Navy today include one 10,000-ton cruiser with 8-inch guns, three 10,000-ton light cruisers with 6-inch guns, two 1,850-ton destroyers, twelve 1,500-ton light destroyers, and six 1,300-ton submarines. The funding required for the cruisers is from the Navy's formal budget for this year. The remaining 20 ships are funded by the Public Works Administration. The Administration initially allocated 40 million US dollars, on the condition that the government and private shipyards each build half. Government authorities stated that the United States must now rush to build warships, because in the eleven years since the Washington Treaty was signed, the United States has only built 44 ships, while Britain has built 151 ships, Japan 153 ships, France 150 ships, and Italy 148 ships.

<p>(Tokyo) The United States government has decided to move the base of the Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific coast. Here is the general impression of the Japanese Navy on the telegram from Washington: The telegram is very simple, so it is not very clear. It may be a change of military port for warships or small fleets, and there may be no special significance. It is also unknown whether the fleet that was temporarily moved from the Pacific to the Atlantic wants to be deployed on the Pacific coast for a considerable period of time. It should not be regarded as a major situation, because the US Navy is carrying out its original plan. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Due to the expansion of military expenditures in recent years, the Japanese government's national finances have reached more than 2 billion yen annually, issuing deficit bonds amounting to half of the total budget to maintain the financial situation. However, the iron industry and other so-called military industries are busy and have gained huge profits. Military authorities have long pointed out this contradiction and advocated the levy of a military industry tax. The Ministry of Finance also agreed with this view. As a result of concrete investigations, it was found that levying a special military industry tax was a difficult problem. At the same time, it was learned that the reason for the huge profits of the military industry was the high unit price. Therefore, it was decided to require the military to reduce the unit price when compiling the budget for the tenth year, to halve the new requested budget.

<p>(Moscow) According to a telegram from Harbin, Soviet employees arrested on the eastern section of the Sino-Eastern Railway have been severely beaten and tortured. White Russian police were most enthusiastic during the beatings. This abuse is nothing more than forcing them to confess to crimes they did not commit but are necessary for the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities. In the past few days, Japanese military police have successively arrested 16 Soviet railway employees. Soviet Deputy Consul in Harbin, Levide, delivered a note to Shi Luben, the representative of the Manchukuo Foreign Ministry, strongly protesting against the actions of the Manchurian police and authorities, demanding an explanation for the arrest of 38 Soviet citizens, and strongly advocating taking effective measures to release the arrested personnel as soon as possible.

Ambassador Ota told Mr. Shi that Foreign Minister Hirota and Ambassador Yurenev had entered into a gentleman's agreement on March 5 that neither side would disclose the content and price of the Sino-Eastern Railway to avoid hindering the successful establishment of the negotiations. However, without the understanding of the Japanese government, the Soviet government suddenly announced all the details through the TASS news agency on August 18.

<p>Japan First Violated the Agreement</p>
<p>(Moscow) A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the Soviet government's order to TASS to publish the price and conditions of the sale of the railway violated the Japanese-Soviet agreement not to publish the numbers and conditions. Izvestia commented, "This strange complaint is again a distortion of the truth. The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is well aware of this. The aforementioned oral agreement was concluded on March 5, but on March 7 the Soviet government protested to the Japanese Foreign Minister, so this agreement had already been violated by the Japanese side, that is, Japanese newspapers disclosed the details of the sale of the railway negotiations. Not only that, but what was published was also inaccurate. Shortly thereafter, the Soviet Embassy had to reiterate the previous agreement as a protest. As for the Soviet Union, it has always respected this agreement and has never disclosed its details. However, when the Soviet press saw that the other party had interrupted negotiations and began to spread rumors, attempting to place the responsibility for the interruption of negotiations on the Soviet Union, it could not remain silent. Therefore, after TASS collected information from relevant parties, it gave a true summary of the course of the negotiations. However, this is like issuing a death sentence to military adventurers in Manchuria and elsewhere, so the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs suddenly recalled this oral agreement in the capacity of a military smokescreen. Who knows that the agreement has been repeatedly broken by the Japanese side? We would like to advise the relevant Japanese authorities to draw a conclusion from this, that is, various agreements are only effective when both parties abide by them. If an agreement is only beneficial to one party and they are held accountable for complying with it, and this is used to promote it, causing unpleasant facts to be covered with a veil of mystery, it is all in vain. If we use the words that Japan loves to use, then these requests can only give people an impression of insincerity." (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Manchurian Daily in Dalian wrote an article on the Far Eastern situation. Izvestia commented on it, saying, "This organ of the South Manchurian Railway actually admits that the arrest of Soviet employees of the Sino-Eastern Railway and all the crazy propaganda of slander and intimidation made by Manchuria and some Japanese newspapers is a method of oppressing the Soviet Union, the purpose of which is to 'get a better deal' and said that this situation is only 'an example of the application of methods and strategies different from those commonly used in the West. ' This admission can be said to be extremely sarcastic. The organ of the South Manchurian Railway thereby admits that the Soviet newspapers' severe condemnation of the Japanese warlords and their press agents is absolutely justified. This recognition will be written in bold letters in the history of their use of unheard-of methods and strategies. They apply these methods and strategies to play with the fate of peace, not to mention that they play with the fate of dozens of innocent Soviet railway employees, and they finally threw them into prison with the great power of the fabrications made by the Manchurian secret society."

<p>Japanese Army Threatens</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia has an editorial titled "Facts Are the Most Stubborn," which states: On August 18th, TASS described the history of the Sino-Soviet Railway negotiations and the situation at each stage in the most candid manner possible. Any fair-minded person can conclude from this that the Soviet Union was willing to make substantial concessions in order to eliminate the source of Sino-Soviet conflict. At the same time, the Soviet Union's concessions were the final step in the negotiations. The Japanese press, deeply fearing that the businesslike tone and impartiality of this report were too credible, secretly suppressed the TASS report and concealed it from readers. The Japanese news agency only made a brief report of the TASS news, solemnly deleting all the facts from its content. If Japan's international status relied solely on Japanese newspapers and news agencies manipulating public opinion in Japan, then they could indeed obtain the most glorious victory for Japan's policies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some facts, though they try to conceal them, are already widely known throughout the world. We only need to glance at the opinions of the leading newspapers around the world to see that they are completely sympathetic to the Soviet Union when commenting on the interruption of the Sino-Soviet Railway negotiations.</p>
<p>"The newspapers published in Tokyo by the Japanese militarists, especially those they support in Manchuria (notorious for their lack of self-restraint), are conducting a violent anti-Soviet propaganda, using all kinds of threats in the hope of alarming Soviet public opinion. However, this only sharpens their intention to invade the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>"Japan constantly complains that the Soviet Union is not 'sincere.' We really have no reason to complain about the 'insincerity' of the Japanese militarists, because the extent of their sincerity has already led them to completely expose themselves. Their newspapers have openly threatened that if the Soviet Union does not make further concessions, they will seize the Sino-Soviet Railway in a warlike manner."</p>
<p>"Currently, the difference in the prices offered by both sides is only about 10 million yuan. Yet the newspapers of the Japanese militarists threaten to seize the railway, which is Soviet property, in order to 'save' several million yuan. The most enthusiastic Japanese press warriors are advocating war for this amount. At this point, we can conclude that these people have completely lost their sense of reality. They are exposing themselves to world public opinion, the effect of which is far beyond what the most skillful anti-Japanese propaganda could achieve. We can adequately state that world public opinion already understands what the significance of seizing other people's railways and the crisis of war really is. We only need to point out to the people of all countries that the Japanese militarists are willing to cause the deepest disturbances for the sake of 10 million yuan, and they will surely think: 'For the Japanese militarists, this is not a matter of 10 million yuan, but of how to find an excuse to seize other people's railways and provoke world chaos.' These people, who know nothing about the facts, can only believe in their guns and swords in the hope of causing disputes, so they can dare to defy the world and carry out their schemes."</p>
<p>"They want to place the responsibility for this situation on the Soviet Union. This will be a waste of effort, because the whole world already knows the Soviet government's peaceful policies and the calmness and patience it has shown in the Far East. The world understands that it is Japan and Manchuria who insist on not making concessions. The newspapers of the Japanese militarists are making all kinds of affirming threats in addition to spreading rumors. This point further explains the uncompromising attitude of Japan and Manchuria on the Sino-Soviet Railway issue. These threats further strengthen the belief held by the world that the main figures of the Japanese militarist adventurers are actively working to set the world on fire and at the same time succeed in completing their long-cherished dream of many years," (TASS telegram of the 22nd).</p>

<p>More Than Sixty Arrested</p>
<p>(Harbin) The "Manchukuo" Police Department suddenly began a major operation on the evening of the 22nd, arresting fifteen Russian railway employees at the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration office who were believed to be behind the conspiracy to derail the train. Thus, the case has spread to the Sino-Soviet Railway Administration, (Japanese News Agency telegram of the 23rd).</p>
<p>(Harbin) Trains on the eastern section of the Sino-Soviet Railway have repeatedly had accidents recently. "Manchu" police have therefore arrested a total of sixty-two Sino-Soviet Railway employees. "Manchu" authorities claim that Soviet Russian railway employees colluded with bandits to intentionally damage trains. The police have been very active since Monday, arresting a total of fourteen Russian employees of the Sino-Soviet Railway in the past few days, (Reuters telegram of the 23rd).</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Sino-Soviet Railway negotiations in Tokyo have stalled, causing a great reaction within the Sino-Soviet Railway. On the second day after the breakdown of the negotiations, disputes arose between the Soviet and Manchu leaders regarding authority. The head of the administration, Lude, stated that due to train derailments and bandit attacks, many employees on the eastern line had been arrested by Manchuria, and there were currently many vacancies. In order to fill these vacancies, without the permission of Director Xu Bin, he first filled the Engineering Department, which had the most Manchu employees, with Russian employees on the 21st. "Manchukuo" considered this an act of overstepping authority and demanded that the new employees be restored to their original positions. Director Lude then ordered the suspension of Director Xu Bin's position. Therefore, Li Shaogeng, the director of the Sino-Soviet Railway, met with Vice-Director Kezilekefu on the 23rd, saying that Director Lude's actions had further deteriorated the current situation and questioned the Soviet Union's overstepping of authority. At the same time, he ordered Zhang Mingzhe, the deputy director of management, to Zeng Lude, the director, to insist on the same argument. However, the Soviet Union showed no sign of remorse, and they parted without any results. Manchuria felt that the Soviet Union had infringed upon the authority of the director of the Engineering Department, which was the most powerful, and could no longer tolerate it. It decided to cancel the act of overstepping authority. Sato, the secretary, took a fast train to Changchun last night to discuss follow-up measures, (Electric Communication telegram of the 23rd).</p>

<p>Willing to Negotiate With Russia Again</p>
<p>(Dalian) The "Manchu government" issued a press release today stating that if the Soviet Russian authorities are truly willing to sell the Sino-Soviet Railway, then the "Manchu government" is willing to reopen negotiations to purchase the railway. The press release also refuted the statements published by the TASS news agency regarding the breakdown of the negotiations, saying that the responsibility for the current situation should be borne by the Soviet Russian government, (Reuters telegram of the 23rd).</p>

<p>Another Train Derailment</p>
<p>Many Puppet Soldiers Killed and Wounded</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 7:00 a.m. today, the "Manchukuo" military train No. 901, which was traveling from Xiaojiu Station on the eastern line of the eastern route to Mifeng Station, derailed due to an obstruction on the track, causing the derailment of one locomotive, one open car, one military car, and one third-class passenger car. It was found to be a conspiracy planned by the Volunteer Army. Therefore, at the time of the accident, it was immediately attacked by a large number of Volunteer Army soldiers lurking nearby. Many soldiers were killed and wounded. A telegram has been urgently sent for assistance, and troops have been dispatched from Yimianpo Station to rescue them, (United Telegram of the 23rd).</p>

<p>(Paris) The General Confederation of Labor recently issued a document explaining the association's views on the Far East incident, which is quite indicative of the labor class's concerns. The association's board of directors expressed concern about the Far East incident and the tensions caused by these incidents between Japan and Russia. It firmly believes that the only way to guarantee peace and prevent overly obvious imperialist ambitions and constant provocations is through public cooperation among nations to respect the principles of international law. The General Confederation of Labor believes that the Sino-Russian dispute should be immediately submitted to the Council of the League of Nations to use peaceful methods to resolve it, (Havas telegram of the 22nd).</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Rome from Iwate, the Japanese acting ambassador to Italy, stating that the Italian government issued a notice to the Japanese Embassy on the 20th, stating that the country's trade situation continues to be sluggish and is deeply afraid of further deterioration. Therefore, it is implementing an import allocation system for certain special commodities in order to prevent this. The content of the notice is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This allocation system is limited to a very small number of manufactured goods and has a general nature without any differential treatment.</p>
<p>(2) The above allocation period shall be calculated from January 31st of this year to December 31st.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs generally believes that the implementation of the import allocation system by the Italian government, as the export of Japanese goods to the major European countries has now been drastically reduced, will not have any adverse impact today. Regarding the goods of 1932, the base year for import allocation, it should try to negotiate with the Italian government, and at least it should insist on using 1933 as the base, (Japanese News Agency telegram of the 23rd).</p>

The newspaper said that according to accurate sources, Germany has a strong will and will continue to carry out its plan to annex Austria, (Havas telegram of the 23rd).</p>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official diplomatic commentary, with the title "The Secret of Florence," revealed Berlin's official attitude towards the meeting between Italian Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. Regarding the issue of expanding economic treaties to include Germany, it said that Italy and Austria hope that Germany will take the initiative, but Germany has been resolving Austria's economic crisis in various ways earlier than other countries. Austria cannot continue its policy of suppressing German nationals in the country without affecting German-Austrian relations. German officials have repeatedly stated that Germany respects Austria's independence. Germany also automatically eliminated the tense situation after the July incident. Therefore, it is now hoped that Austria itself should remove the obstacles on the road to German-Austrian peaceful cooperation. Regardless of whether the Florence conference can make Austria understand the need to proceed in this direction, the Germans' hope is ultimately legitimate. Dr. Schuschnigg's trip to Nice is surprising, and we have to believe that he will meet with French politicians, (National Telegram of the 22nd).</p>

<p>Australia Imposes New Tax on Cotton Goods</p>
<p>Lancashire Protests</p>
<p>Claims to be a Violation of the Ottawa Agreement</p>
<p>(London) The Australian Commonwealth recently imposed a new tax on cotton fabrics exported by Lancashire, England. Lancashire industrialists have decided to launch a resistance movement. All counties in northern England and major central areas affected by the new Australian tax will join this movement. Today, representatives from various cotton industry associations went to visit the Australian Commissioner to the UK and informed him that if the new tax imposed by the Australian government is not abolished, the British people will uniformly reject Australian goods. The Commissioner promised to convey this to the Australian government. The problems between the governments within the British Empire are complex, and the cotton industry problem is only one of them. Due to their geographical location, the economies of the various parts of the Empire are often dominated by countries outside the Empire. For example, the financial and commercial relationship between Canada and the United States is closer than its relationship with the mother country. Australia also has a tendency to turn to the United States and Japan. In order to protect its emerging industries, Australia does not hesitate to impose taxes on goods from the mother country. This time, the Lancashire cotton industry problem will have a significant impact on the evolution of the British Empire's economy. It is also heard that Commercial Minister Runciman has decided today to handle this matter himself and has asked the Australian Commissioner to inform the Australian Commonwealth government of this situation. It is rumored that merchants from all relevant places will participate in the planned boycott movement.</p>
<p>(London) Today, the Ministry of Commerce held a meeting to discuss the dispute between Australia and Canada regarding cotton goods tax rates. A delegation of Lancashire cotton industrialists filed a formal protest against the Australian tariffs, claiming that it violated the Ottawa Agreement and said that even if the industry had a reasonable opportunity for economic victory, the tax rate was too high and did not adhere to the provision in the Ottawa Agreement that British manufacturers should enjoy reasonable competitive opportunity. The delegation visited Mr. Bruce, the Australian Commissioner to the UK, and was received by him, who promised to report the matter to the Australian government. Commercial Minister Runciman claimed that he is currently closely monitoring the entire case and plans to discuss the matter with the Australian government. As for the Australian side's claim that the total amount of the tax is only £197,000, the Lancashire delegation replied that what is being contested now is the principle, and the numbers are secondary, (Reuters telegram of the 22nd).</p>

<p>(Washington) It is heard that a dispute has arisen over the management rights of the National Recovery Administration. General Johnson will remain the director of the Recovery Administration. He strongly argues that the management rights should be controlled by one person, assisted by an advisory committee. However, President Roosevelt's industrial advisor, Richberg, and Labor Secretary Perkins both demand that the advisory committee should have real power and that the administrative director should be in a secondary position. President Roosevelt is rushing back to Washington to deal with other important issues of the Recovery Administration. President Roosevelt originally planned to go to Hyde Park in New York to visit his mother, but he has now canceled this trip, (Reuters telegram of the 23rd).</p>

Roper declared to industrialists and businessmen that in the past, various parties had made unthinking declarations about the purpose of the new economic policy, causing people to believe that there was no hope of making a profit and that they had no intention of running a business. In fact, the new economic policy does not prevent individuals from seeking profit. Its purpose is to implement supervision, so that economic recession will not recur, and to protect individual competition and freedom of creation.

<p>(Havana) Cuba, after a relatively long period of peace, is facing the danger of revolution again today. However, on the eve of the uprising, the conspiracy was discovered in the Cuban army. Twelve people were arrested and immediately ordered to be executed by firing squad by the temporary military court. Among them was one lieutenant colonel. The failure of the conspiracy was due to the rapid action taken by Batista, the leader of the Cuban army, (Reuters telegram of the 22nd).</p>
<p>(Havana) A conspiracy case has recently been uncovered in the Columbia military camp, where the General Staff Headquarters is located. Its purpose was to force Colonel Batista, the Chief of Staff, to expel President Mendieta and declare a military dictatorship. Twenty military officers have now been arrested and imprisoned in the Cabañas Fortress and will be summarily tried. Major Echevarría and Captain Eliz also are on the list of those arrested. The government has also sent troops to the city of Pinar del Río to arrest Lieutenant Colonel Hainan, the leader of the conspiracy in that area. Hai resisted arrest and was killed on the spot. It is generally believed that Colonel Batista, the Chief of Staff of the Army, has been focusing on politics for some time, so he has lost some of his potential influence in the army, (Havas telegram of the 22nd).</p>

<p>Kong Hechong, After Defecting</p>
<p>Attends Jiangxi Headquarters Memorial Week</p>
<p>Reports on the Collapse of the Red Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Kong Hechong, the leader of the bandit army on the border of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, after surrendering to the National Army on the 25th of last month, because his family members were still in the bandit area and had not come out with him, and because negotiations with his former troops to return to the government had not yet matured, the authorities kept it a secret. It was not until today (the 20th), when Kong attended the Memorial Week at the headquarters, that the truth became clear. At about 8:00 AM on the morning of that day, Kong went from the reception office of the headquarters to the auditorium of the headquarters to attend the enlarged Memorial Week. He was wearing a blue Zhongshan suit and a gray hat. He was of medium height, bald, with a long face and slightly exposed teeth. His eyes were bright and gleaming. After the music was played and the meeting began, He Guoguang, the director of the First Department, presided over the meeting. After performing the rituals, he reported on the recent progress of the suppression of the Red Army in the five provinces and introduced Kong to the public, saying, "Mr. Kong Hechong is the former commander-in-chief of the Sixth Army Corps of the Red Bandits and a member of the Puppet Central Committee. He was a very important person in the bandits. However, based on his past few years of experience, Comrade Kong has three feelings: (1) Communism is not suitable for China. Class struggle is nothing more than a brutal act of murder and arson, and the result is only self-destruction. (2) Since the National Army's five encirclement and suppression campaigns, the strict implementation of the blockade, blockhouses, highways, and Baojia policy has gradually shrunk the bandit area, and both spiritual and material conditions are in distress. It has reached the final stage of collapse. (3) He believes in Chairman Chiang's character, perseverance, and dedication, and should sincerely support this leader of national rejuvenation." Therefore, Kong was transferred from the border of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan to the Red Army University of the Puppet Central Committee in Ruijin last year for training. He graduated in June of this year.</p>

<p>The Entire Chinese Nation Awakes! Respectfully Inscribed by Kong Hechong, 1942</p>
<p>Afterwards, under the pretext of inspection, he traveled from Xingguo to Taihe and took the initiative to surrender to Commander Zhou Hunyuan of the Eighth Column on July 25th. When he was in Nanchang, he was introduced to the Chairman by Guoguang, who gave him great comfort and commendation and appointed him as a counselor at the headquarters. He will also participate in practical work in the future, which is highly anticipated. I am sure that everyone will welcome this new comrade. Kong was a brave and promising person in the past. He laid down his butcher knife and became a Buddha on the spot. I believe that Counselor Kong will definitely be able to be loyal to the Party and the country in the future. This is also what we hope for, and so on. After the report, Kong stepped onto the stage amidst applause, bowed to the audience, and began to speak in a Hunan accent. First, he reported on the internal affairs of the bandits and the recent collapse situation in detail. Then, he said that he had come here with the greatest determination to eliminate the Communist bandits and revive China under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek. His words were quite firm. After the speech, the music was played and the meeting was adjourned. Kong is a native of Pingliu, Hunan. He joined the Communist Party in the 16th year of the Republic and rose through the ranks to become the commander-in-chief of the Jiangxi-Hubei-Hunan Military Region and the commander of the Sixth Army Corps, with no less than 70,000 to 80,000 bandit troops under his command. The bandit troops in eastern Hunan, southern Hubei, northern Jiangxi, and western Jiangxi were all under his control. His position in the bandits was very important. In November of last year, Zhu Mao dismissed Kong from his position and transferred him to Ruijin for training. Zhu's trusted confidants, Xu Yangang, the former commander of the First Division, and Gao Yongsheng, took over Kong's duties. Kong completed his training in June of this year and returned to the border area of the three provinces. He went from Xingguo to Taihe and surrendered to Zhou Hunyuan's troops. After Kong surrendered, he was secretly escorted to the province by Zhou. He was initially housed in the rear guard of the 36th Army, and few outsiders knew about it. Later, he was appointed as a lieutenant general counselor at the headquarters, with a monthly salary of 500 yuan. Kong now has detailed written and oral reports on the bandits' military and political plans, the situation of the bandit leaders, and the conditions in the bandit area. Kong was previously a military leader in the three-province border area, so since Kong's surrender, the number of people returning with weapons has been endless. The elimination of the Red Bandits in the three-province border area is not far away.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Xiamen <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Large Export of Silver</p>
<p>Over Two Million Six Hundred Thousand Yuan in Forty Days</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since U.S. President Roosevelt bought silver and declared silver nationalized, international silver prices have soared. Xiamen has also been affected, with large amounts of silver being exported. According to Xiamen Customs statistics, from July 3rd to August 17th, silver dollars exported from Xiamen to Hong Kong totaled over 2,293,500 yuan, plus 5,600 yuan in silver ingots. The shipments by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. included: on July 3rd, the Netherlands' Anta Bank loaded 300,000 yuan onto the *Taiyuan*; on the 24th, Yongkang Bank loaded 50,000 yuan onto the *Taiyuan*; on the same day, Anta Bank loaded 320,000 yuan onto the *Luzhou*; on the 27th, Chengyi loaded 75,000 yuan onto the *Jinan*, and Yongkang 70,000 yuan, plus 5,600 yuan in silver ingots; on August 4th, Jinbaohe loaded 10,000 yuan onto the *Taiyuan*, and Hetai 80,000 yuan; on the 11th, Anta Bank 300,000 yuan. In addition, four shipments were made to Hong Kong by Douglas Lapraik &amp; Co.: the first for 75,000 yuan, the second for 175,000 yuan, the third for 300,000 yuan, and the fourth, on the 17th, the *Haicheng* loaded 118,500 yuan, totaling 2,293,500 yuan, plus 5,600 yuan in silver ingots. Subsequently, on Saturday the 18th, the *Taiyuan* left for Hong Kong, with Anta Bank loading another 300,000 yuan and Dasha Bank loading 60,000 yuan. It is estimated that from July 3rd to August 18th, a total of 2,659,100 yuan in silver was exported from Xiamen to Hong Kong. Afterwards, banks and silver firms are still likely to continue shipments. According to people in the money industry, although the silver purchase was initiated by the United States, Britain buys more in the Far East than the United States, so most of China's silver exports are destined for Hong Kong, because Britain uses Hong Kong as the central hub for silver purchases. Speaking of Xiamen, every 1,000 yuan, besides the transportation fee of 1.5 yuan, can earn a profit of three to four yuan. Previously, silver exports had to be reported to the Silver Firms Association and, with the association's permission, the customs supervisor would issue a passport before it was allowed to be transported out. Recently, silver exports, except for silver bars, silver ingots, silver bullion, and silverware which are subject to taxation, silver dollars are all tax-free and can be freely imported and exported. However, most of the exports in recent months, apart from a portion from money shops, have been from Anta Bank alone, which has shipped a total of 1,820,000 yuan in silver dollars to Hong Kong in six shipments, accounting for over 68 percent.

<h3 id="e111">Chiang and Zhang Discuss Disaster Relief in Hubei <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Disorder in Various Counties, Affecting the Future of Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>The Central Government Has Decided to Establish a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The disaster situation in Hubei Province is dire, with many refugees. Although the government has tried hard to raise funds for disaster relief, it is like a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Many counties have not yet received rain, and there is no way to promote agricultural recovery. Although work relief is underway, there are not many funds, and the scale of the projects is small, accommodating only a few refugees. Moreover, women, children, the elderly, and the weak are not allowed to participate, so emergency relief is crucial. Considering that large amounts of money have not been raised, the emergency relief funds received by each county are only two or three thousand yuan, which is not enough to provide widespread assistance. The poor refugees are fleeing one after another, and the strong and cunning are gathering crowds to rob and loot. The situation is serious and has almost reached the final stage. Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces, believed that the expansion of the disaster area would affect the military operations of bandit suppression. On the 17th, he sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang requesting urgent relief measures. The telegram stated, "To Chairman Chiang in Kuling, the drought in Hubei Province is extremely severe, especially in the counties of Daye and Yangxin in southern Hubei, and Huang'an and Macheng in eastern Hubei. According to reports from commissioners Li and Cheng, as well as various unit commanders, refugees in various places often gather in groups of thousands, begging to go out and find food, and some even rob food and disrupt order. I earnestly request that you quickly grant relief. If we do not plan ahead and urgently seek relief, I fear that if traitors instigate, the refugees may unite with the bandits, and the events of 1932 may be repeated today. A small spark can start a prairie fire, and a rebellion is to be feared. The Hubei Provincial Government has proposed raising one million yuan, but I fear it will be a drop in the bucket. Moreover, the nine counties in southern and eastern Hubei are in the midst of bandit suppression and the situation is urgent, which differs from other counties, so it seems necessary to seek separate emergency relief. If there is any negligence, all previous efforts will be wasted, which would be a pity. What I see as dangerous, I dare not fail to report. Now that Brother Yuejun (He Yaozu) is conveniently in Kuling, I respectfully request that you summon him for consultation and discussion, and grant urgent relief measures, either by directly allocating large amounts of money from your office, or by asking your office to transfer it to the central government, to alleviate the immediate crisis and avoid a crisis, so that the future of bandit suppression will not be affected. I am extremely anxious. Zhang Xueliang kowtows in gratitude and submits this report." He also telegraphed Zhang Qun, saying, "Brother, you are well aware of the situation in the nine counties of southern and eastern Hubei. To eliminate the disaster, urgent relief is needed. I beg you to earnestly plead when you visit the Chairman and immediately seek relief measures, which I earnestly hope for." On the 18th, Zhang Qun replied by telegram, saying, "Generalissimo Chiang is deeply concerned about the disaster situation in Hubei Province. After receiving your telegram, he immediately instructed Qun to earnestly consult with Brother Yongzhi (Kong Xiangxi). Last night, I had the opportunity to meet with Brother Yongzhi, who stated that the central government's financial situation makes it difficult to allocate disaster relief funds for emergency relief. At present, we can only provide convenience in terms of grain transportation and sales. Other measures are still under discussion." Chairman Chiang's reply telegram also arrived in Hubei on the 20th, stating, "To Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang of the Wuhan Headquarters, I have received and carefully read your telegram. I have informed President Wang and Ministers Kong and Zhang of the drought in Hubei Province to earnestly plan. Minister Kong replied that he has discussed the matter of disaster relief in Hubei Province with Chairman Zhang and Director Jia (Shiyi) and decided that, in addition to the Hubei Provincial Government's plan to raise one million yuan for emergency relief, the central government has decided to establish a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, which will be organized by the Ministry of Finance, to handle price stabilization. If local and charitable organizations can find ways to raise donations to subsidize it, it will have considerable results, which I hereby inform you of. Chiang Kai-shek, Kuling." "It is said that the provincial government authorities have raised 60% of the million yuan for disaster relief, and are continuing to raise the rest. They have also decided to sell all the public properties of the Shengchengli neighborhood in this city to be used for disaster relief. Regarding the food problem for the people, provincial committee member Li Shucheng was previously sent to Hunan to contact He Jian to purchase rice and organize price stabilization. The result was very satisfactory. He has agreed to release Hunan rice to aid Hubei and reduce taxes. The 100,000 dan of Hunan rice that has been ordered can be transported to Hubei in a few days, and will be handled by the Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee to organize price stabilization and maintain the food supply for the people."

<h3 id="e112">90th Division <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Recaptures Two Important Locations</p>
<p>Dozens of Hand-to-Hand Battles</p>
<p>Hundreds of Bandits Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The 90th Division of the Fourth Army has always been known for its bravery and combat skills. This time, it was ordered to advance directly from Yongfeng to the bandit dens in Longgang. In battles such as Shaxi and Guojiaping, they were victorious in every engagement. It is now known that on the 14th of this month, the division was again ordered to occupy Baimao Mountain and Xiongkou. On that day at dawn, the division's attacking troops advanced, with the rest as reserves. The bandits used solid earth forts and machine guns to sweep the division. The division charged desperately, approaching the bandit forts but refusing to retreat. They threw grenades to prevent the division from advancing. The officers and soldiers of the division fought bravely and fiercely, and Yумаkeng was occupied by the division. The bandits were forced to retreat to the high ground of Baimao Mountain. The division took advantage of the victory and continued to attack Baimao Mountain forcefully. The bandits resisted stubbornly with superior terrain and solid defenses. The fighting between the two sides was fierce, with dozens of hand-to-hand battles. The bandits eventually collapsed and retreated in the direction of Nankeng and Xionglingxia. At 8:30 AM, the division definitively occupied Baimao Mountain. Division Commander 口口口 ordered the 口口口 regiment to advance to the high ground near Xiongkou and quickly build fortifications. In this battle, hundreds of bandits were killed or wounded, and over a hundred were captured. The division captured one light machine gun, dozens of Mauser pistols, and over a hundred rifles. Dozens of officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. The battle ended. According to captured bandits, the bandits who fought against the division were the Third Regiment of the Pseudo 23rd Division and the newly added Yongfeng Independent Regiment, totaling about 4,000 men.</p>

Article 32: A creditor who may be included in the liquidation in accordance with paragraph 1 and the proviso of paragraph 2 of the preceding article may only exercise his rights in accordance with legal procedures after the declaration of liquidation.

<p>The *Rong Bao* newspaper of this county is edited by Shen Shoukuang and has a strict editorial line and a large circulation. Previously, it published the original complaint of Zhang Yonglin and Lu Boshen of Xiaokunshan against Wang Huankun, the former district chief of the Ninth District, regarding accumulated grain funds. Later, Wang sent a letter requesting a correction, but the newspaper believed that the letter was not stamped and could not take responsibility for it, so it did not make a correction and published the letter at the end of the newspaper as a response. Wang Huankun then filed a private criminal lawsuit in court against the newspaper for violating the publishing law. The trial opened this morning. After Judge Wang questioned the plaintiff and the plaintiff finished stating the reasons for the lawsuit, the defendant Shen Shoukuang appeared in court with his lawyer Peng Zhongjun and stated in his defense that the letter requesting a correction was not legitimate and could not be said to be a violation of the publishing law. Later, the rebuttal was published in the newspaper and they requested that the judge declare him innocent. The court adjourned and announced that the verdict would be announced on the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Husband Critically Ill, Wife Suddenly Dies Tragically <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaoyu, a farmer from Lv Wutu, Huayang Bridge, east of the city, worked as a cook at Jinjietang. His son, Xiao Ahe, farmed at home. His wife, Ms. Ye, was 20 years old and had been married this spring. They loved each other very much. Unexpectedly, her husband suddenly became seriously ill the day before yesterday. Ms. Ye was very anxious. This morning, Ms. Ye suddenly felt a headache and went to rest in the adjacent room. Her family did not suspect anything else. Later, her parents-in-law were suspicious because their daughter-in-law had not come out for a long time, so they called their eldest daughter-in-law to check on her. To their shock, they saw Ms. Ye lying in a pool of blood. They quickly called her parents-in-law to check, and they found that she had stopped breathing. There were knife wounds on her throat and body. For a time, onlookers from near and far gathered. There were many different stories about the cause of death. This morning, Prosecutor Meng Zhou led officials to examine the body and ordered it to be placed in a coffin for further investigation.</p>

Furthermore, Zhang Wei, a police inspector from the Civil Affairs Department, also came to Songjiang yesterday and went directly to the county government to inquire about the public security situation in the county. He then went to the Public Security Bureau and the various police stations in the city to inspect, take roll call, and give instructions. It is said that he will go to the various township branch bureaus and police stations for inspection starting tomorrow, and will only be able to return to the province to report after completing his duties.</p>

<p>Large Number of Korean Bottles Discovered While Digging a Well</p>
<p>During the Southern Song Dynasty, this county was located on the coast of the East Sea. Han Shizhong once stationed troops here to defend against the Jin. At that time, the army used pottery bottles to hold water. Many of these bottles were discarded and buried underground. Occasionally, they were recovered from the river. Those who loved antiquities treasured them because of their long history and called them Korean bottles. This has been going on for a long time. The county government's neighbor, an old woman surnamed Gu, was a relative of Gu Weijun, the envoy to France. She had a piece of land that she mortgaged to Chen Shilai of the Nanyang Hotel. Last winter, Gu returned and built a house for herself. Now, on August 20, because the river water was low and dirty, she hired workers to repair an abandoned well. When they dug three or four feet deep, they discovered the aforementioned antique Korean bottles densely packed underground. Thousands have already been discovered. However, most of them were broken, and only sixty or seventy were intact. The bottles are about one foot three or four inches tall, with the smaller ones being less than a foot and the larger ones being more than two feet. They are coated with green glaze. Some are slightly flat on top and round on the bottom, some are large in the middle and have four ears on the neck, some are slightly flat on both the top and bottom, and some are round and intact on both the top and bottom. People who came to see them bought them for one or two dimes, or four or five dimes each. They are still being excavated.</p>

<p>Small Black Bugs Discovered in Rice Fields</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, there has been a severe drought with no rain. The river water has dried up and the farmland has cracked. Fortunately, the authorities purchased water-lifting machines for relief, and there was a slight rainfall last month, so the crops began to improve slightly. People were hoping to avoid a famine this year, but unexpectedly, there has been no rain for the past twenty days. Now, when the rice grains are forming ears, they are mostly withered and dying from the sun. Recently, black bugs have suddenly been discovered in the villages of Xixu Market in the Fourth District. They specialize in gnawing on the upper part of the rice stalks, and they spread extremely quickly. Once a rice stalk is gnawed by the bugs, it dies within half a day. Therefore, people have now given up hope for the autumn harvest, and the farmers have reported the famine to the authorities again.</p>

<p>The County Treasury was established two months ago. All government agencies must first submit their annual budgets and allocation lists to the provincial department for approval before they can withdraw funds from the treasury. Furthermore, the forms issued by the county accountant are extremely complicated and difficult to understand at once. Currently, only a few agencies have received their July public funds. Recently, the various district offices have been unable to withdraw funds, which has caused various troubles and has prevented them from promoting their businesses. Now, the various district chiefs have jointly requested to improve the fund withdrawal methods. If they continue to deliberately make things difficult, they will all resign.</p>

<p>Petition to Province Regarding Dam Demolition</p>
<p>Zhou Weisan, the town chief of Gushan Township, Jiangyin, led more than a thousand people to forcibly demolish the barren dike of Chenshu Town in this county twice, causing disputes. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the people of Chenshu believe that the dike is the lifeline for the people of various townships in the vicinity. Now that it has been demolished across the border by the people of Gushan Township, 50,000 mu of fields will be hopeless due to drought and urgently need to be restored. Therefore, they have specially elected more than ten representatives, including Yao Puru, Sun Weilin, Yao Xinchui, and Yao Daoxin, to go to the province yesterday (the 23rd) to petition the provincial government and the civil construction departments, requesting that the dike be restored to its original state as soon as possible, and that Zhou Weisan, the town chief of Gushan, who is the ringleader, be severely punished according to the law.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently plans to issue 30 million yuan in public bonds for the purpose of consolidating construction and guiding the Huai River, and both the civil and financial leaders have gone to Beijing to negotiate. It is now learned that Qian Sunqing, the supervisor of the local county Chamber of Commerce, believes that the finances of Jiangsu Province in recent years have never been officially disclosed. The people of Suzhou have no knowledge of how much profit or loss there is. It is vaguely heard that the handover of the provincial government has never been completed by previous officials, which shows the chaos of finance. This 30 million yuan public bond requires an annual interest of 2.1 million yuan and has a term of up to 20 years, which increases the burden on the people and is truly alarming. Using debt to pay off debt only increases interest. At present, the old accounts should be cleared and concluded, and everything should be made public in the future, and income should be based on expenditure. Therefore, yesterday, he specially sent letters to Yu Xiaochuan, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, and the Wuxi Association of Fellow Provincials in Beijing, and forwarded them to the Jiangsu Associations of Fellow Provincials in Beijing, requesting that they unanimously petition the central government to stop it, and order the authorities in Jiangsu Province to implement financial disclosure.</p>

He originally planned to rest in a small inn to avoid the trouble of dealing with visitors, but at the persuasion of Mr. Mao, he stayed at the Dacheng Hotel, unknown to outsiders. He went to participate in the ceremony on the morning of the 22nd. After the ceremony, Mr. Wu had not yet left the gate when suddenly the wife and sister of Yu Canrong, the victim in the assassination case in the county, held a petition and knelt on the road, begging for justice for her husband. After being stopped by people, Mr. Wu hurried past them and said that if there was injustice, the county magistrate was inside and they could appeal to him. As they approached Zhencheng Road, Yu's wife and sister still staggered along, constantly shouting about injustice. Mr. Wu, seeing their pitiful situation, took the petition and told them to return home. The elderly Mr. Wu then walked back to the hotel. Many people visited him at one time. He then left Changzhou by car at about 1:00 p.m. and went to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Letter from the Xiang'an Salt Affairs Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We have read in the eighth edition of the second page of your newspaper on August 9th of this year that the Huai Chamber of Commerce in Xiang'an is currently sending representatives to Beijing to petition, alleging that this office is oppressing Huai merchants, coercing them to pay hundreds of thousands of yuan in advance taxes, and even forcing Huai merchants to depreciate their debts and compete for sales, and sending personnel to interfere with the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce. We were very surprised to read this. After investigation, this office has always levied taxes on salt according to regulations and has never ordered merchants to pay taxes in advance. The so-called coerced payment of hundreds of thousands of yuan in advance taxes is purely fabricated and has no basis in fact. As for the establishment of salt sales offices and the competitive sale of salt, it was done in accordance with the instructions of the Salt Affairs Audit Directorate-General, Directorate-General No. 417, which was forwarded from the Ministry of Finance. Although the Huai merchants in Xiang'an requested a ten-month period of deliberation and gradual implementation, this office has repeatedly rejected this request on the grounds that the establishment of salt sales offices in Xiang'an was carried out in accordance with the Ministry's order, and that the four shores should be opened uniformly, and Xiang'an should not be an exception. At present, whether the Changsha salt sales office withdraws salt and competes for sales is entirely up to the merchants, and there is no forced devaluation. Regarding the case of merchants collecting various donations within the price of Huai salt, which is handed over to the audit authorities in Lianghuai and the four shores to collect and review payments according to the old established items, it was also done in accordance with the instructions of the Directorate-General No. 624, which was forwarded from the Ministry of Finance, ordering the acceptance and handling from the date of the order. This office sent personnel to take over in compliance with the order. How is this interfering with the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce? Moreover, Huai salt was originally under official supervision and commercial transportation, and this office should have the direct power of supervision. The points mentioned in the original text are completely inconsistent with the facts. We are sincerely afraid that the rumors will be untrue, confuse the public, and hereby send this letter to your newspaper, requesting that you check and disclose this letter to correct the record, and we will be very grateful. Sincerely, to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao, from the Xiang'an Salt Affairs Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance, August 17th.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Ministry of Finance Yesterday Consulted the Municipal Government <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Revised Deed Tax Measures</p>
<p>Reduce Tax Rates and Lighten Penalties</p>
<p>Implement Audit and Review Measures</p>
<p>The National Finance Conference resolved to revise four deed tax measures in order to reduce tax rates and lighten penalties. The Ministry of Finance submitted them to the Executive Yuan for resolution and approval. The original deed tax regulations will be abolished after the new regulations are promulgated. After the Ministry of Finance requested instructions, it consulted with the provinces and cities for notification and ordered the provincial and municipal finance departments and bureaus to comply. The four revised deed tax measures are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>(Regular Tax and Additional Rate) and Deed Tax Paper Fees, (1) The regular deed tax rate should not exceed six points three per mille for sales. Those above the limit will be reduced to six points three per mille, and those below the limit will remain the same. (2) The deed tax surcharge should be half of the regular tax in principle. Those above half will be reduced to half of the regular tax, and those below half will remain the same. (3) The deed paper fee is 50 cents per sheet, uniformly for sales and mortgages.</p>
<p>(Audit Methods) (1) Promotion and collection should be handled simultaneously with the deed tax. While paying taxes, promotion and transfer should be handled simultaneously. (2) Deed papers should be standardized in a uniform style, and the promotion, transfer, and the amount of land tax and surtax payable should be clearly stated in the deed. All transfer receipts can be abolished. (3) In order to prevent tax collectors in various counties from collecting more and reporting less, changing deeds, and engaging in fraud, deed tax vouchers should be affixed to the stitched seams of the deed paper for audit purposes.</p>
<p>(Review Methods) (1) A consultation will be sent to the Ministry of Justice to circulate to courts at all levels nationwide and county governments that also handle judicial affairs. Whenever civil and criminal lawsuits are heard and deeds that have not been completed deed tax should be submitted to the collection agency for supplementary taxation. If there is any collusion or fraud, senior officials will be punished according to law. (2) A consultation will be sent to the Ministry of Justice to stipulate in the regulations on the registration of real estate in the court that the rights of sale, purchase, and mortgage should be proven by a red deed that has been completed deed tax. They should be submitted to the tax collection agency for supplementary taxation before registration.</p>
<p>(Penalty and Exemption) Standards, (1) Overdue and short concealed deeds will be subject to progressively increased fines, but the maximum amount of the fine shall not exceed the amount of tax payable. Special circumstances may be exempted from fines. (2) Untaxed white deeds will be allowed to be taxed within a certain period to avoid penalties.</p>

<p>Must Not Levy Salt Surtaxes</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Issues an Order to the Provincial Authorities</p>
<p>To Strictly Prohibit and Reemphasize National Taxes</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the National Government believes that the collection of salt surtaxes by various provinces hinders the unification of national taxes, and on the day before yesterday, it instructed the Executive Yuan to forward the order for compliance. After receiving the order, the Executive Yuan immediately issued an order to the provincial authorities to strictly prohibit it. The original text is extracted as follows: (Omitted above) It is hereby ordered by the National Government that salt is a national revenue and should be uniformly collected and managed by the Ministry of Finance. Localities must not establish other names and levy surtaxes again. This has already been ordered to the Executive Yuan for compliance in December of the 19th year of the Republic of China. According to the report of the Executive Yuan, some provinces have indeed complied with the previous prohibition, while others have superficially complied but secretly continued to collect as usual. This situation seriously hinders the unification of national taxes. The highest military and political officers of each province should instruct all subordinate agencies and local organizations to strictly abide by the previous order and never establish any names under the item of salt to collect additional donations and taxes. They should also instruct the county magistrates of each county to supervise at any time, strictly prohibit it, and reemphasize national taxes to avoid disputes. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>Has Exceeded One Million Shi</p>
<p>Mostly Saigon Rice</p>
<p>Other Provinces Have Also Purchased</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Ri Ri News Agency met with Mr. Zhang Binghui, the chief of the Fourth Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, and asked about the extent to which foreign rice has been ordered recently. According to him, since the implementation of foreign rice registration, many people have registered. The foreign rice recently ordered by the banking industry and the rice industry will reach 1.1 million shi, mostly Saigon rice. The import of this rice is not entirely sold in this city. For example, the Gan Province is also sending personnel to Shanghai to purchase foreign rice from rice merchants because the food supply for the people is insufficient. Therefore, the extent to which foreign rice is ordered in the future will depend on the needs.</p>

<p>Zhang Rice Still Not Inspected and Released</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Min merchants Jianji, Dingda, Deda, Yongji, Huang Yitai, and Jianyuan transported 15,239 packages of new Zhang rice from Xiamen on the Fuping, Nanchang, and Yuezhou ships. The Jianghai Customs considered them suspicious. After the rice industry group proved it, the rice merchants paid a deposit to release them. However, according to the tax regulations, foreign rice imported from Xiamen should pay half the tax. Therefore, foreign rice transferred from Xiamen to Shanghai should pay another half the tax. The rice merchants requested that half the tax of 1.7 yuan per dan be paid for release. However, the Customs believed that to pay half the tax, the evidence of half the tax paid by the Xiamen Customs should be presented first. Since these rice packages have been released by the Xiamen Customs, it means that half the tax has not been paid in Xiamen and should still be paid the full tax, plus surtaxes and a 40% fine, totaling 6 yuan per package, totaling more than 80,000 yuan. The rice merchants thought the amount was too large to pay and that the procedures for investigating and refunding in the future would be very troublesome. Therefore, they have not paid. Currently, the Zhang rice is still in the customs warehouse.</p>

<p>Most of It Has Been Agreed</p>
<p>To Be Continued After Feixin Dun Returns</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese newspapers in Shanghai yesterday morning published news that was inconsistent with the facts regarding the negotiations between the municipal government and the Public Concession Engineering Bureau on the construction of roads beyond the boundaries. According to reporters' inquiries with relevant parties, this negotiation has resulted in a draft agreement after several meetings between Secretary-General Yu of the municipal government and Director-General Feixin Dun of the Engineering Bureau. The content of the agreement has reached a solution on the area of ​​the extraterritorial road construction and the police power issues in the area. However, the financial revenue and expenditure issues of extraterritorial road construction have been postponed again because the opinions of the two sides are still not the same. Therefore, the date of the settlement of the negotiation will depend on when the difficult focus is agreed upon. The main body of this negotiation is the municipal government and the Engineering Bureau, but the Director-General of the Engineering Bureau, Feixin Dun, who is responsible for this negotiation, is currently on leave and has returned to his country. Therefore, the continued negotiation of this case will also have to wait until Fei returns to Shanghai in November.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Wu Yang Ship <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Has Been Towed to Shanghai by Yu Shun</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive This Sunday</p>
<p>After the Zhaoshang Bureau's Yu Shun ship lost its engine blade in the waters of Fuzhou, the shipowner Jiang Changqing telegraphed Shanghai for assistance. The Shipping Department, because the blade was lost 60 nautical miles outside the port of Fuzhou, and it was likely to drift, first telegraphed the sea-leased ship on its way to Guangdong to quickly tow the Yu Shun ship to the waters near Mazu Island (Matus) where it could be temporarily anchored. It then urgently dispatched the Wu Yang ship to Mazu to find a way to tow the Yu Shun back to Shanghai, install a new engine blade, and notify the insurance company that the losses such as the lost engine blade would be borne by the insurance company as usual. At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the bureau received a telegram from Wu Yang saying that it had arrived in Mazu and, at 8:40 a.m. yesterday, had towed the Yu Shun ship and was returning to Shanghai. Mazu is about 300 nautical miles from Shanghai, and the Wu Yang is towing the heavily loaded Yu Shun ship, traveling at only 6 nautical miles per hour. It is estimated that it will not be able to enter the port until Sunday morning. The cargo inside the Yu Shun ship is entirely cotton yarn and foreign cloth, with only more than 1,000 pieces of miscellaneous goods such as paint and cigarettes. The value of the goods in the ship is about 300,000 yuan. The Zhaoshang Bureau yesterday notified various passengers and informed the insurance companies underwriting cargo insurance that the towing fee for the required Wu Yang ship is about more than 10,000 yuan, which will also be borne by the insurance companies. After Yu Shun arrives in Shanghai, the cargo will be transferred to the Wu Yang ship and transported to Hong Kong and Guangdong.</p>

<p>Two New Ships Will Arrive Soon</p>
<p>Employ Chinese Captains</p>
<p>Seeking Hong Kong's Opinion</p>
<p>The four Hai ships built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity are being produced one after another in British shipyards. Haiyuan and Haiheng will be able to arrive in Shanghai within two months and start operations. The bureau is actively working on allocating routes and assigning crew members.</p>
<p>(Selecting Captains) The new Four Seas ships cost 1.44 million yuan each and will be used as formal liners in South China. The captains will be the most experienced and technically skilled Chinese, and the first and second mates and engineers will also be hired from the country.</p>
<p>(Telegraphing Hong Kong Bureau) These four ships will all go to Hong Kong and must obtain Hong Kong passenger ship licenses. Hong Kong is very strict in inspecting ocean liners. If the construction is slightly inconsistent or the age is too old, passengers will not be allowed to board, and even entry will not be allowed. The Four Seas ships have no problems with the above points, but it is unknown whether the Hong Kong authorities will be picky about using Chinese captains. Therefore, the director of the Hong Kong branch has been telegraphed to inquire with the Hong Kong Customs and reply by telegraph for verification. This telegram has been sent but has not yet been answered.</p>
<p>(Discussing Sailors) The Four Seas ships need a large number of sailors, stokers, and other crew members. The bureau specially held a bureau affairs meeting yesterday, calling together the heads of various departments to discuss the issue of hiring new sailors. The specific measures have not yet been announced.</p>

<p>Previous Banknotes Still Fully Valid</p>
<p>After the Farmers and Merchants Bank resumed operations, the head office was established in Shanghai and branches were established in Shanghai and Hankou. The Ministry of Finance approved the issuance of banknotes with a total amount of 2 million yuan. The bank decided to issue the previously unissued banknotes on September 1st, divided into denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. It was rumored that there were problems with the previously issued banknotes. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Xiang Xiaoliu, the secretary of the head office, yesterday. According to him, the banknotes issued by the former Farmers and Merchants Bank were completely recovered at that time. It is not true that there were problems with the banknotes. If people hold banknotes from the former Farmers and Merchants Bank, they can be fully cashed at the bank.</p>

<p>of Overseas Chinese Returning from Japan</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese who operated buckwheat noodle shops in the Senbei Xiang and Hiraka Gun of Akita Prefecture, and the Kazuno County in Japan, were from Qingtian County, Wenzhou, Zhejiang. This time, 24 people, including Pan Jinfeng, Liu Beguang, Wu Qishan, Wu Zhaoyao, Huang Jingu, Wu Degao, Liu Zhiguo, Pan Xuejun, Pan Minggao, Zhuo Fangfa, and Wu Yifang, were sent back to China by the Japanese. They all returned to China by Japanese ships from Kobe. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The overseas Chinese were destitute when they returned to their country because they were not allowed to bring silver or objects. Therefore, the overseas Chinese were very embarrassed when they arrived in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, they returned to their ancestral homes in Wenzhou.</p>

<p>Seals Two Warehouses</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News on the 23rd, the No. 3 and No. 4 warehouses of the Japanese Post Office pier in Hongkou were suddenly sealed by the Jianghai Customs on the afternoon of the 21st, and the cargo owners and customs brokers were in a panic. The reason for the sealing was that artificial silk worth 15,000 yuan was secretly smuggled and hidden in the No. 3 and No. 4 warehouses. In addition to confiscating the artificial silk, the Customs authorities did not allow other goods in the warehouse to be transported out. However, the customs brokerage association did not receive any notification. Therefore, the losses of the association members must be very large. The Japanese Post Office branch in this port is currently negotiating with the Customs authorities to unseal the warehouse in order to recover the losses.</p>

<p>Regarding the dredging of Shentan at the Yangtze River estuary, the Dredging Bureau previously consulted the Hydrographic Bureau to send personnel to sound the depths first for dredging purposes. After receiving the letter, the Hydrographic Bureau immediately sent surveying technicians on ships to measure the degree of silting at the site. At that time, because the wind and waves at the estuary were very large, it was impossible to proceed and had to be temporarily suspended. Now that the wind and waves outside Songkou have been calm in recent days, the bureau yesterday sent personnel to proceed with the sounding. Once completed, it will send a letter to the Dredging Bureau for dredging based on the sounding report.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Liu Hongsheng Petitions <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance to Suppress Tax-Evasion Matches</p>
<p>Swiftly Order Changes to Customs Auction Regulations</p>
<p>To Eliminate Malpractices and Maintain National Product Operations</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the National Match Industry Association of China, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating (abridged above): It has been found that the import of tax-evading matches was previously only discovered in Fuzhou and Xiamen in South China, but now the Jianghai Customs has also discovered this type of</p>
<p>tax-evading matches. It is evident that the import of tax-evading goods is gradually increasing. Without fundamental preventive measures, not only will the operations of legitimate merchants be affected, but also the future of tax revenues will be greatly hindered. The Customs Department has been auctioning confiscated matches according to regulations. However, the goods still exist after the auction, and the legitimate merchants find it difficult to compete because of the low auction prices.  Confiscated matches are tax-evading before the auction, and the confiscated tax-evading matches are allowed to be openly sold after the auction. If the consolidated tax is collected by the Customs Department, the consolidated tax collected is included in the auction price, then the consolidated tax authority has also collected the consolidated tax in an invisible way and allowed it to be sold. When it is sold, it gets an additional guarantee. If a part of the confiscated tax-evading matches is counterfeit, then which are counterfeit and which are not? The Customs Department has not been able to clarify the situation. When auctioning, the counterfeit matches are not removed. Confiscated tax-evading matches and counterfeiting are both</p>
<p>openly sold without any hindrance, which violates the legal system and infringes on operations, there is nothing more serious than this. Furthermore, according to past situations, the Customs Department sometimes knows that it is counterfeit. When auctioning, the counterfeit trademark is torn off and replaced with the words "Top Match". Its intention is nothing more than to avoid counterfeiting on the one hand and still be able to sell it through auction on the other. However, those who evade and steal taxes can sell it by changing the words "Top Match", so they all follow suit and tear off the trademark of the stolen matches and change it to the words "Top Match". As a result, the auctioned tax-evading matches and the stolen matches that have not been seized are indistinguishable and difficult to identify, causing difficulties in the consolidated tax inspection, and the stolen tax-evading matches can escape justice and can be sold without hindrance. This was not expected by the Customs Department at first, but since this kind of malpractice has occurred, the Customs Department's previous method of changing the label and auctioning is not perfect, and it is necessary to correct it together. I think that the import of tax-evading matches is increasing day by day. The fundamental</p>
<p>preventive method is difficult to delay. I have received the tax document No. 1780, which was approved by the Tax Administration to draft a prevention plan and submit it for approval. It has been a long time now, and it has not been drafted and implemented. I would like to ask your ministry to order it again so that the fundamental prevention method can be realized as soon as possible, so that the operations of merchants and national tax revenue can both benefit from it. As for the section on changing the Customs auction, I have learned from the Tax Administration that the previous submission of this association has been sent by your ministry to the Customs Department for review. The Customs Department has consulted the Tax Administration for opinions, but the Tax Administration has not yet replied. This is the reason why this case has not been resolved so far.</p>
<p>Delayed in turn. This case is originally a customs issue, but it is also related to the consolidated tax. I would like to ask your ministry to order the Customs Department and the Tax Administration to jointly review and handle it, so that there will be a most appropriate solution to follow as soon as possible. I hereby submit another official document and sincerely ask for your inspection and implementation as soon as possible. I am waiting for your orders. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance, by Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Match Industry Association of China.</p>

<p>Special Reduction in Railway Freight Rates</p>
<p>Since domestic railways began handling responsible cargo intermodal transportation, the intermodal transportation of goods on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways has become increasingly developed, with the downstream (from Tianjin to Shanghai) freight transport being particularly prosperous. Recently, in order to utilize the upstream empty vehicles, further develop business, and revitalize agriculture, industry, and commerce, the two railways have formulated particularly low intermodal freight rates for various bulk goods from Shanghai to Tianjin. For example, the current freight rate for flour is 7.63 yuan per ton, but it is now proposed to charge only 3.78 yuan, a reduction of as much as 80%. Other goods such as rice, cotton yarn, refined cotton yarn, piece goods, scrap iron, and high-quality matches have also been reduced by 30% to 80%. This special price has now been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. If approved, it can be announced and implemented. It is expected that the transportation of the aforementioned bulk goods from Shanghai to Tianjin will be even more active at that time, benefiting various industries, which will be significant.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Telegram from the Cotton Trafficking Industry Association <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Suggestions on Combating Watered and Adulterated Cotton</p>
<p>Telegram from the Cotton Trafficking Industry Association to the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, National Economic Commission, Cotton Control Commission: We have read in the newspapers that the fourteen articles of the Regulations for Combating Watered and Adulterated Cotton have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and will soon be promulgated and implemented. This demonstrates the government's painstaking efforts to improve the value of domestic cotton, which is deeply admired by those in the cotton industry. Cotton merchants, recognizing the many malpractices in domestic cotton production in recent years, originally hoped to rely on the government's efforts to bring about reforms, so as to improve the status of domestic cotton in the world's cotton production and reduce the suffering of traffickers. Merchants are eager, how dare they hold different views? However, this matter is a pioneering undertaking and should be carefully considered for its gains and losses to facilitate its implementation. We believe that this crackdown regulation is not carefully planned. However, before it is popular and inspected, it will be implemented suddenly, and there will be many obstacles in the future. The merchants have always purchased cotton in the distribution markets of various provinces and cities and transported it to Shanghai. In peacetime, they hate those sellers and companies in the areas where there is no inspection who commit fraud. However, it is not easy to change the accumulated habits, so the cotton transported to Shanghai is often criticized by manufacturers, and the water and seed discount is always reported more than less, resulting in huge losses. If the government's inspection agencies can be popular and the traffickers can be guaranteed, all malpractices can be eliminated. Therefore, if you want to improve, you must start with popular inspection, and then implement the crackdown, which is appropriate. It is found that the former Ministry of Industry designated the cotton inspection area as Hankou, Shashi, Shandong, Qingdao, Shanghai, Ningbo, six places. Since the opening, only Hankou and Shashi have electrical moisture inspection, and most of the other ports have not been implemented. Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces are the richest areas for cotton production. Because the inspection has not been implemented, the moisture content sometimes exceeds 20%. Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong are also rich in cotton production. Except for a part of Shandong that is inspected, most of the rest are transported to Shanghai by the Longhai Railway. The moisture content is above the standard because it has not been inspected. Shanghai has never had an import inspection. In fact, it is only equivalent to the Hankou and Shashi re-inspection agencies. In recent years, the cotton transported to Shanghai from various ports, only Hankou and Shashi, those who have passed the inspection can still pass the test, and the rest cannot meet the standard. As for the admixture inspection, no province or city has yet to start it. If the crackdown is implemented in accordance with the crackdown regulations, I am afraid that 70% to 80% are in the list of punishment and suspension of trading and use. Moreover, the moisture content and cotton seed statutory standards set in Articles 1 and 8 of the crackdown regulations are stricter than the old Shanghai customs standards. In fact, it may be difficult to do it. According to the moisture standard, it is set at 11%. Cotton produced in the northern plateau may be able to pass the test. The Yangtze River Basin is humid. Shanghai is more important than the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. If the moisture is not relaxed, it will be difficult to meet the standard. The cotton seed statutory standard is set at 0.05%, which is also too strict. Before the improvement of the cotton gin in our country, the limit should be slightly widened. In summary, the popular inspection is the most important. If the popular inspection is not given priority, no matter how it is cracked down, it is difficult to meet the standard uniformly. Moreover, the crackdown regulations are also related to foreign countries. Japanese merchants have long been deeply involved in the cotton industry in our country. If the reform does not start from the root, the crackdown will be difficult to reach Japanese merchants. It is equivalent to using a paper decree to control the Japanese merchants. The result will make the cotton trafficking that Chinese merchants have struggled for for many years to be occupied by Japanese merchants. In terms of domestic business conditions, cotton is a major product, and the producing areas are all over more than ten provinces. The annual income is hundreds of millions. Not only the national commerce relies on it to support it, but also the financial sector uses it to circulate. That is, the annual national tax revenue is also huge. Cotton industry has such a significant relationship with national commerce, and if the measures are not perfect, it is easy to affect the overall situation of commerce. Since the crackdown news came out, merchants have been worried about the difficulty of future operations. In order to take care of the capital and avoid being punished innocently, many intend to wait and see or intend to stop the industry. Moreover, when the new flowers are on the market, if it is unfortunately endangered the cotton market, the result will not only affect the cotton industry, but also the national commerce and finance will inevitably be hindered. It is a matter of the future of the cotton industry. Merchants are difficult to remain silent. I would like to tell you by telegram that I hope that your Yuan will be able to temporarily delay the implementation of the crackdown regulations, and at the same time, the Ministry of Industry will set up inspection agencies in various producing areas, strictly implement the inspection of tide seeds in parallel, and if it cannot be widely spread in the producing areas for a while, then the inspection will be popularized in advance in the distribution markets of various provinces and cities, and the packaging patterns will be printed and the unified weight will be determined, and the inspection bureaus will be ordered to turn around and make the merchants follow. I think that if this is done, not only can the malpractices of watering and adulteration be eliminated, but also the cotton transported and sold in the future will be able to meet the standards uniformly, and the packaging weight will not be uneven. After the inspection is popular and there are results, the crackdown regulations will be revised and promulgated and implemented in six months, then the value of domestic cotton will gradually increase, and the buying and selling of the cotton market will also get real benefits. Moreover, the merchants have more to come. In the future, the inspection laws and regulations should be unified in order to emphasize the credibility of the country. It is hoped that it will not be effective in the previous port A inspectors, and the port B cannot be effective. In the same area, the factory inspector is not effective, causing the traffickers to lose their basis and suffer losses. Is it appropriate? I respectfully wait for your decision, and I beg for instructions. I am in charge of the telegram, and the Shanghai Cotton Trafficking Industry Association bows down with all the merchants, to raise,</p>

<p>Learns of the Tragic Situation of the Drought in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>Urgently Awaiting Relief from All Sectors</p>
<p>According to news from the Sino-Foreign Relief Association at No. 97 Renji Road, the severe drought this summer, with months of no rain, has led to a famine, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Letters and telegrams requesting relief from various places are increasing daily. The disaster situation in various counties of Anhui was described in this newspaper yesterday. The following is a description of the disaster-stricken counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It is heard that the association is eagerly awaiting good-hearted individuals from all walks of life to donate grain and medicine for relief. (1) Jiangpu: The county is barren and the people are poor, and it has repeatedly suffered from famine. The rural areas have already gone bankrupt and it is difficult to recover. This spring, it was first damaged by locusts, and in the summer, it suffered from drought. The land cracked and the ponds dried up, and the rice seedlings died. Looking at the overall disaster situation in the county, Youtian and Gao Wei are the most serious. At this time of the autumn harvest, the population is sparse, and the rice is exhausted, and they are hungry and cold. Not only are the starving people sad, but the hidden worries are also not small. (2) Gaochun: The county is located in the southwest corner of Jiangsu Province, with mountains and weirs accounting for half of it. Floods and droughts occur frequently, and people's lives are difficult. This summer's severe drought has wreaked havoc again. The fields and crops have died, and the land has cracked. People have no water to drink, and cattle have no grass to eat. People are displaced everywhere, and there are thousands of people a day. There is no way to make a living, and it is bound to become a starving people. It is deeply feared that there will be more people who take risks, and social order will be impossible to maintain. (3) Jiaxing: The Wangdian area of the county is relatively high in terrain, and the ports and canals are narrow. The irrigation of farmland relies entirely on the water ponds for filling. This summer, there has been no rain for a long time, the ice source has dried up, the rice fields have no water, and the seedlings have withered. In this time of rural collapse, the general farmers have long had no good harvests, and they are exhausted and difficult to get enough to eat. Suffering from this drought, starvation is a great worry. (4) Haiyan: Since the beginning of summer, the weather in the county has been extremely hot, and no rain has fallen, causing the rivers to dry up and the fields to crack. The rice seedlings that have been transplanted have all withered, and there is no way to replant those that have not been planted. The autumn harvest is feared to be hopeless. This year, it has also been affected by the failure of silk cocoon and the decline in agricultural products. The suffering of the farmers is difficult to describe. The water is deep and the fire is hot. (5) Yongkang: The county is shaped like a ladder, with hills and ridges everywhere, and the composition of the geology is sandy soil, which seeps and leaks everywhere, making it difficult to accumulate water. In addition, rural areas have gone bankrupt in recent years, and water conservancy has been lost. Unexpectedly, in summer, the sun is scorching in the sky, and the clouds are not obscured. The seedlings that have been shown have all withered, and there is no hope for the late rice to be harvested. Life is extremely difficult. (6) Chongde: This county is an agricultural area. In the past, the mulberry fields and sorghum crops were enough for the residents to live and the security was good. However, in recent years, due to the decline of the silk cocoon industry, the local economy has collapsed. This summer, the drought is abnormal, the sun is scorching, the mud is as hard as stone, and the rice fields and crops are withering day by day. In addition, the rivers and rivers are exhausted, and it is impossible to save them. It is also difficult to grow crops.</p>

<p>Setting Up a Hospital Focuses on Practice</p>
<p>Female Students Sign Up Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Shengsheng Midwifery School was established last autumn by famous doctors Yu Yunxiu, Wang Qizhang, Cai Yumen, Wang Yugang, Xia Shenchu, Qu Zhifu, Zhu Qiluo, Jiang Zhenxun, Xu Jihua, Qu Shaohang, and enthusiastic pharmacist Xu Xiangsun. The school's textbooks are all taught by the initiators in their respective specialties. At one time, there were more than 60 students who signed up for school. This year's students have achieved very good results. This autumn, they will practice. From the summer vacation, the students will be assigned to designated hospitals, such as Pudong Hospital, Shenjiang Hospital, and Qu Zhifu Hospital, for practice. A Western-style building at No. 59 Saposai Road, French Concession, has been selected to set up a hospital for practice at any time. The hospital has designated a part for medical treatment, and specializes in obstetrics, and also treats other diseases. Regarding obstetrics and gynecology, it is presided over by Qu Shaohang, an expert in obstetrics and gynecology, and his wife, Yao Yingnai, a female doctor. Mr. Qu has been in the Yin Qu Family Hospital in Peiping for 17 years and has a good reputation. Last year, he moved back to Shanghai, and those who were treated were praised as three-folded arms. It is heard that the school is now recruiting the second class of midwifery students, and those who have signed up one after another are now nearing full capacity. The exam will be held soon. Because the new site of the rented hospital is spacious, female students who generally admire the school and are interested in obstetrics are signing up for the school these days in order to enter the school and serve the society in the future.</p>

<p>Lao and He's Wedding is Simple and Commendable</p>
<p>Lao Jingxiu from Guangdong has been doing business in Shanghai for more than 50 years. He has a wide range of social activities and has served as a member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. He has founded various industries and advocated for education and charity. He is currently a director of various companies and other important positions. A few days ago, his eighth son, Zhaojun, married Miss He Aizhen. On that day, both parties used ordinary invitation cards to invite dozens of relatives and friends. When the guests arrived, the wedding ceremony was announced. Then, Mr. Huang Zukang presented the process of introducing the engagement, and Mr. Liang Xiangshu was the marriage witness. After the ceremony, the guests enjoyed the banquet. It is also heard that Lao's grandson, Jingxian, was married the month before, and it was also handled in this way. Afterwards, relatives and friends praised it very much. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the government has not promulgated the civil wedding ceremony, and the society has no idea what to do. As a result, the complicated ceremonies have become more and more serious. Poor families borrow money to do it, and rich people are extravagant. Customs have been passed down from generation to generation and are unbreakable. Now, when the national New Life Movement is being held, the Lao and He families are advocating frugal marriage in the society, which is also commendable.</p>

<p>Yesterday Decided on Methods to Demand Rent Reduction</p>
<p>The houses in Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, caused a lawsuit due to the Yiyuan Company Management Office forcing tenants to sign a contract. After the court ruled, it is now heard that the landlord has suddenly withdrawn the appeal and filed a lawsuit in the court to enforce the first-instance judgment to terminate the contract. The court has scheduled it to be executed at 8 a.m. on the 24th of this month. The tenants sent a letter to the owner, Sun Chuanfang, the day before yesterday, detailing the various oppressive situations of the management office, demanding to stop the lawsuit, and asking to reduce the rent increased last year to reduce the burden. The reply was not received. Yesterday, the Xicheng Lane Branch of the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special Zone Citizens Federation held a general meeting in the afternoon. More than 70 people attended. Yao Xingyuan presided over the meeting. First, Li Ruzhang reported on the past negotiation work. After the meeting, the following countermeasures were decided: (1) When the court executes the termination, all will be present in court to express recognition of the old contract and invite to pay half of the litigation costs. (2) Since the new contract has been ruled by the court, it is illegal, and the rest who have been forced to sign will file a counterclaim. (3) It is found that the tenants have been harmed by the management office's unwarranted litigation this time, and a detailed investigation should be conducted in order to demand compensation in accordance with the law. (4) The rent reduction issue has been sent to the owner, Sun Chuanfang, demanding a reduction of the rent increase in 1919, but has not yet been answered. A notice should be issued immediately to temporarily suspend rent payments and store them in the bank designated by the association for safekeeping until the matter is resolved. The above methods were approved by all, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Shi Laohu Also Involved</p>
<p>Police File Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Shao Wenbin, a Pudong native known as Ma Fu A Liu who performed in Shanghai opera at Changben Tan, abandoned his old profession to engage in flower gambling and open a *datong*, leading to disputes with others in the trade. On the evening of July 28th of last year, he was shot and killed on Route Wagner in the French Concession. At the time, detectives pursued the murderers and killed one suspect. Subsequently, the special unit of the French police apprehended a co-conspirator, Zhang Bingrong, a Ningbo native nicknamed Xiao Ningbo, and turned him over to the Special Court No. 2 for initial trial. Zhang was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Zhang, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court No. 3, claiming that Cao A Wu, Li Lan Di, Shi Laohu, and others conspired to instigate the assassination. Consequently, Zhang's sentence was changed to life imprisonment. Currently, he is appealing to the Supreme Court for a third trial. Last month, the French police apprehended five flower gambling gangsters, Qian A Jin, Shi Laohu (also known as A Quan), and others, in room 15 of the Dongchang Inn in the Five Phoenix Lane on Avenue Joffre. After they were sent to the Special Court No. 2 for interrogation and sentencing, the police, believing that Shi was involved in the Shao murder case, took him back for further investigation. The police also took the un-convicted prisoner Zhang Bingrong (who was being held in the jail due to being a serious murder suspect) from the detention center to the jail to confront Shi. The investigation has now concluded. The other day, the police sent Shi to the Criminal Division No. 1 of the Special Court No. 2 for questioning, and Zhang was also sent as a witness to provide evidence. Judge Li Changnian conducted the interrogation. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and filed a prosecution for murder. Shi Laohu, when questioned, denied participating in the assassination of Shao Wenbin. Zhang Bingrong, when questioned, stated that he did not know Shi Laohu, who was involved in the case. The court reviewed the testimonies and, finding that the case required further investigation, adjourned the hearing to the 28th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

They confiscated 54,000 red pills, manufacturing equipment, raw materials, and drugs. They were sent to the Special Court No. 2 for public prosecution. This was reported in the previous newspaper. The interrogation has now concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian of the Criminal Division No. 1 ordered the three defendants to be brought to court. Zhang Rensheng was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and fined 200 yuan for manufacturing opium substitutes. Tang A Mao and Wang Shunkang were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and fined 100 yuan for assisting in the manufacture of opium substitutes. The number of days spent in custody before the final judgment was determined, with two days counted as one day of imprisonment. The fine, if commuted to imprisonment, was calculated at two yuan per day. The red pills and equipment were confiscated. The defendants were transferred to the detention center.</p>

<p>At about 5:00 AM the other morning, Patrol Officer No. 39 of the General Patrol Room was patrolling Suzhou Road near the entrance of the Chinese Park. According to the gatekeeper of the park, a young man, about 24 or 25 years old and resembling a worker, was lying on the ground in the park. The officer followed him inside and found the man suffering greatly, moaning incessantly. When asked, he could not speak. The officer reported to the relevant police station, and an ambulance was called to rush him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He soon died. It was determined that he had ingested opium. Upon investigation, the detectives found six pawn tickets and two blank sheets of paper near the deceased. There were no other items. It is suspected that he entered the park and committed suicide by ingesting opium due to financial difficulties. The body was taken to the Filun Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang was dispatched by the First Special Court to examine the body and issued a statement confirming that the deceased was an unnamed man who died from opium poisoning. Since no family members were found, the body was handed over to the Pushan Undertaker for burial.</p>

<p>The Hongjintang Pharmacy at No. 1059 Dongxi Huade Road was founded by local natives Wu Genrong and Xu Yongxiang. They hired Xu Shifang, a 32-year-old Jingjiang native, as manager and accountant. He resigned from the store in June of this year and opened his own Houde Tang Pharmacy at No. 933 on the same road. It was discovered that between September of the 20th year of the Republic and June of this year, he embezzled 600 yuan of savings from Gao Linshi, the wife's younger sister of Wu Genrong. Wu reported this to the Huishan Police Station, which dispatched detectives the other day to arrest and detain Xu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division No. 3 of the First Special Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated the details of the case, claiming that the defendant did not record the savings and used them secretly. He presented a copy of Gao Linshi's (Fuji) savings passbook for inspection. Wu Genrong claimed that during the defendant's time at his store, the silver dollar savings accounts were managed by him, and he should not have used the relatives' savings privately. Gao Linshi testified that the savings were given to the defendant in two installments to collect interest multiple times. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Lawyer Yan Eson requested bail. Judge Wu Zhehan ordered Xu Shifang to provide a 1,000 yuan shop guarantee. Without a guarantee, he was returned to custody.</p>

<p>At about 7:00 PM on the 19th of this month, a kerosene stove was overturned in the Xiantang Hall at No. 17 Wenyuan Lane, Rue P. Lemaire, French Concession.

The hospital notified the police, who sent a hearse to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuantang Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren was dispatched by the Second Special Court to examine the body and confirmed that the deceased had died from burns. Since the only family member was her mistress, Peng Shaoqing, who was in the hospital and not yet healed, no one appeared.

<p>Sent to Court for Adjudication</p>
<p>Xu Xiafeng, Chen Fangzhu, Wang Zhenwu, and Lu Wenxi, four police officers from the First Precinct, First Substation of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, were on duty at Wangjia Pier on the night of July 21st of this year at around 11:00 PM (it was raining at the time). At that time, Xu A Er, a Jiangbei native residing in the Ximen area, was returning to his hometown due to his mother's illness. He instructed his friend Fan Xiaojing to carry several pieces of luggage and hire a rickshaw to wait at the pier. Chen Fangzhu (Post 7) noticed the rickshaw carrying luggage late at night and questioned him, creating various difficulties and threatening him with words. Xu Xiafeng (Post 5) and Wang Zhenwu (Post 6) heard the commotion and came to assist. Fan Xiaojing explained the reason for the trip, but Chen Fangzhu and others still refused to let him go. Fan Xiaojing was anxious and begged on his knees, saying that if he was delayed any longer, he feared the ship would sail. The police then smiled at each other and waved him away. When Fan Xiaojing rushed to the pier, the ship had already sailed. He reported the situation to Xu A Er, who was unwilling to accept it. He immediately went to the police station to accuse them. Section Chief Yi immediately sent external affairs patrol officer Guo Qingchong to investigate on the spot. It was also discovered that on the morning of the 19th of the same month, Xu Xiafeng, Wang Zhenwu, Lu Wenxi, and others extorted 1.40 yuan from the owner of the Laohuzao (old fashioned stove) at No. 241 Wangjia Pier under the pretext of cleaning up garbage, and divided the money among themselves. The section chief was furious upon receiving the report and immediately dismissed the four police officers, reported to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau, and transferred them to the Procuratorate of the Local Court. Prosecutor Zhang Zi conducted an initial investigation and filed a public prosecution against Xu Xiafeng and Wang Zhenwu under Article 128, Paragraph 1 and Article 318, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, Chen Fangzhu for violating Article 318, Paragraph 2 of the same law, and Lu Wenxi for violating Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the same law. The other morning, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the Fifth Court for investigation. The judge, for the sake of caution, ordered the detained defendants to be brought to the case for separate inquiries. First, Xu Xiafeng testified that he was 22 years old, from Huai'an, Jiangsu, and lived in Gaochang Temple. He was sent to the police station from the training institute and had only been there for just over a month. He did not cause any difficulties for Fan Xiaojing. As for the 1.40 yuan that the Laohuzao owner gave us on July 19th to buy cigarettes, I received 40 cents, and the rest was in Wang Zhenwu's hands. I was really confused at the time. Please, Judge, give me leniency. Next, Lu Wenxi testified that he was 29 years old, from Shandong, and lived in Caiyang Lane. I didn't get a penny. If I had gotten any money, how could I have reported it to the patrol officer? I was falsely accused. Please, the court, investigate. Chen Fangzhu testified that he was 27 years old, from Zhenjiang. On July 21st, I did not ask Fan Xiaojing for money or make things difficult for him. Please, investigate. Wang Zhenwu testified that he was 25 years old, from Taixian. On July 19th, the Laohuzao owner gave me 1.40 yuan, and I gave Xu Xiafeng 50 cents and Lu Wenxi 50 cents. At this point, the judge invited Prosecutor Zhang Zi to the court to advise on his opinion. Finally, lawyer Hu Yuanjun, hired by Lu Wenxi, rose to defend him. The official announced that the debate on the case was over and that the verdict would be pronounced on the morning of the 27th of this month. Lu Wenxi was still released to his original guarantor.</p>

The two children she had born were four and two years old. Her husband was Pan Xiangzhao from Wenzhou. When her husband was 17 years old, he opened a noodle restaurant in Hanaoka Town, Akita County, and she had a relationship with him. Later, the Akita Prefecture authorities ordered him to return to his country because his business was not permitted. Therefore, she brought her two children to Wenzhou. The Japanese police did not allow her to go and ordered her to stay at the Hinode Inn on Wusong Road and send her back to Japan.</p>
<p>There was also Lin Huantang, the son of Chinese American Lin Yuting, from Taishan County, Guangdong. He went to the United States in the eleventh year of the Republic of China and had a relationship with a Japanese woman named Ito Hatsu Eda. Last fall, Lin returned to China and lived with his former wife, Li Fengchun, at No. 99 Yongfeng Lane, North Sichuan Road. In November, Hatsu Eda, missing her husband dearly, came to Shanghai from the United States. Lin then abandoned Li and took Hatsu Eda. However, Li Fengchun was very unwilling and accused Lin of bigamy in the Special District Court.</p>

<p>Pays Attention to Mad Dogs Biting People</p>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council is concerned that mad dogs often bite people in the district, which is quite dangerous. It issued a notice to citizens yesterday to pay attention. The New News Agency reporter went to the Police Department of the French Municipal Council yesterday to inquire about the measures to protect citizens who have been bitten. According to the person in charge, the dog's nature is easily angered and bites people during this hot weather. Now, for the sake of rescue, the bureau notifies residents that regardless of whether they are bitten by any dog, they must report to the bureau. The bureau will send someone to examine the dog from the dog owner. If it is a mad dog, it will immediately notify the injured person to go to the dog doctor for treatment. All medical expenses will be borne by the dog owner. However, the Municipal Council will fund the treatment of stray dogs. It has been found that there have been more than 30 such incidents so far. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Rare Events in Farming Families <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>A Cow Giving Birth to Triplets</p>
<p>Rare Fact, Some Say Auspicious</p>
<p>Three Cows for Running Said Ominous</p>
<p>Jiang Yongsheng, a rural resident of Pudong, who lives at No. 17 Shengjia Alley, Tangqiao District, has always been a farmer. Since the past few years, due to repeated disasters, the harvest in the fields has suffered a lot. Since the beginning of summer this year, the drought has been a disaster, which is even more worrying. Fortunately, at the end of last year, he bought a cow. In this drought, it has been used to irrigate water, and the work has been very busy. However, the cow was already pregnant and has recently been unable to withstand the field labor, so it has also stopped working and is resting. At about 7:00 PM the other night, the cow suddenly gave birth. Jiang Yongsheng immediately prepared everything for it. Within the first five minutes, it gave birth to a calf. But the cow's abdominal pain remained. Three minutes later, it gave birth to another calf. Jiang Yongsheng was overjoyed, but at this time, the cow's condition was still not peaceful, and he was very surprised. Then, ten minutes later, it suddenly gave birth to another calf. In total, it gave birth to three calves. For a moment, everyone who heard about it marveled. It is customary for cows to give birth to only one calf. If they give birth to twins, it is rare. Farming families must set up a banquet to celebrate. Today, one birth of three calves is something that has never been heard of. Moreover, all three calves are females. Their size is not smaller than ordinary newborn calves. Although their feet are slightly weaker at birth and they cannot stand up, they can now lie down and walk and are unusually lively. Superstitious villagers believe that the matter is rare and auspicious, while others say that three cows are for running, which is an ominous sign. There are many opinions, and no one can agree. And at Jiang Yongsheng's home, the thresholds were worn through by the visitors.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Rampant Drug Atmosphere in Western Shanghai <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Police Officers Should Pay Attention at All Times</p>
<p>Recently, poor workers in western Shanghai who are addicted to red pills have switched to heroin (also known as white powder) because they are aware of the strict prohibition by the police, and they have to lie down with lamps and guns when smoking, and the smoke is dense. For the sake of convenience, they now only need a cigarette holder when smoking. Yesterday, Gu Wentao, a patrol officer of the Sixth Precinct Substation on Route Robert, learned that someone in a thatched house in Louhua Lane on that road was specializing in the private sale of heroin for people to smoke, and that it was often full of customers, so the business was quite developed. He immediately led the police to the address and arrested the private seller Zhao Xiaoqiu and the smokers Xu A Er, Gu Wenzong, Chen Xiaodi, and others, a total of ten people, and seized a package of heroin and a small package of ash. They were all detained and sent to the Sixth Precinct, where District Member Xing interrogated them separately and then prepared a document to send them to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Bi Zhenhua, the chief of the Second Precinct Substation of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in Xujiahui Town, Western Shanghai, recently found that someone was privately injecting morphine in the Jiji Bridge area to satisfy people's addiction. He ordered the police chief of the precinct, Li Xuede, to pay attention to the investigation at all times. After receiving the order, Chief Li led the police on patrol in Zhao's warehouse the other morning when they suddenly saw a drug den in house number two, which was used to inject morphine. They arrested morphine criminals Pao A Er from Pudong and Zhou Bingsheng from Henan. The others escaped through the back door. They seized two packages of morphine, two large and small magnetic bottles, a small amount of morphine, and two bicycles, and took them all to the station and transferred them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Cui Zhen from Shandong and Zhou Wenbiao from Pudong were walking on Tianyaoqiao Road when they were spotted by police officer Zhang Ronggui and detective Hu Zongxi of Post No. 9 there. Suspecting that they were suspicious, they searched them and found six or seven packages of morphine on Cui Zhen and one package on Zhou Wenbiao. They took the witnesses to the station. After Chief Bi briefly interrogated them, considering that the case involved private trafficking of drugs, he ordered them to prepare a document and send them to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>All the criminals were sentenced yesterday for transfer</p>
<p>All handed over to Wu Song District 7 Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM on the 11th of this month, a murdered young female corpse was discovered in a wasteland near the Wu Song Zhong Sheng Radio Station. Upon investigation by Xin Jingsheng, a detective from the District 7 Public Security Bureau, it was found that the female corpse was named Ding Shiwen, from Yangzhou. Together with Yang Xinzheng, a detective from the Chengdu Road Patrol Room of the Public Concession, they successively arrested the suspects in the case, including Dai Yujin, Rao Bingnan, an accountant at the Nanjing Automobile Company on Moore Road, and Hang Zijing, a collection clerk, as well as Dai Bai, and others, for a total of four people. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and held for further investigation to determine the location where the deceased was murdered, with further questioning. This was reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendants jointly hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. The patrol room lawyer, Di Tianyin, stated that the case was being adjourned and that the patrol room was conducting a detailed investigation of the Nanjing, New York, and Philips automobile companies where the defendant Rao Bingnan worked, but found no traces. He requested a review. Xin Jingsheng, a detective from the Wu Song Public Security Bureau, also submitted an official document requesting the transfer of the case. Judge Wu Tingqi briefly questioned the four defendants and ordered Dai Yujin, Rao Bingnan, Hang Zijing, and Dai Bai to be handed over to the Wu Song District 7 Public Security Bureau detective to be taken back for interrogation and handling.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Rickshaw Puller Tire Deflation Incident <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Instigators continue to be interrogated</p>
<p>Patrol Room Lawyer says there is one more key witness, temporarily withheld</p>
<p>Hoping for a final court questioning to protect his life</p>
<p>Zhu Maocheng and Wang Zhiren testified for Zhu Shuqiao yesterday</p>
<p>The case was not fully heard yesterday and will continue this afternoon</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the rickshaw tire deflation incident on the 9th and 10th of this month, the Public Works Bureau Police Department, citing disturbances to the peace, detained rickshaw pullers, ruffians, and others involved in the tire deflation, handing them over to the court for sentencing. In the span of two days, the number reached over 300 people. Subsequently, after an investigation by Detective Mai Kaidi from the Political Department, it was found that the instigators of the incident were Zheng Fazhu, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, He Wushan, and Zhu Shuqiao. They were arrested one by one, and the Public Works Bureau lawyer filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court on charges of obstructing freedom and property damage. Two interrogations have already been conducted, as detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. The Public Works Bureau was represented by lawyers Bo Liang and Ru Bao Yi. Lawyers Chen Tingrui, Jiang Baoli, and Wu Kaisheng from the Rickshaw Business Association, and lawyers Wu Linkun, Fu Ganghou, Yao Yongli, and Yu Chengxiu representing the defendants, were all present on time. The audience was also</p>
<p>(Packed to the rafters) with hardly any room to stand. After Judge Zhan took the bench, Patrol Room Lawyer Ru Bao Yi immediately stated that during the previous hearing, lawyer Wu Linkun, representing the defendant Zhu Shuqiao, requested that Zhu Maocheng and Wang Zhiren, members of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, be summoned to testify in court. They have been summoned today. The patrol room needs to present two points of evidence regarding the defendant Zheng Fazhu: (1) There are three witnesses today, Wang Er, Li San, and Wang A'er, who can prove that Zheng gave them benefits on the 9th and 10th of this month, instructing them to engage in tire deflation and participate in the strike. (2) Small rickshaw business owners Shi Haiyuan and Wang Zaocheng, after the Rickshaw Affairs Committee announced the new regulations, entrusted Zheng Fazhu to collect 24 new licenses, at which time Zheng said that a deposit of 240 yuan was required, but as a result, Shi and Wang only received half the receipts. Shi and Wang inquired with Zheng about the use of the remaining money, and Zheng replied that it was for handling fees. Therefore, whether Zheng should be held responsible for fraud or accepting</p>
<p>(Exercising bribery) has not yet been determined, and the case is being adjourned. Zhu Shuqiao also wrote a confession, detailing the process. Please refer to it. It was then presented to the court. It was also stated that there is one more witness, who is extremely important. For the sake of protecting his life and safety, it is requested that he be questioned last. At that time, the court should be asked to prohibit the audience. Therefore, his name and the facts he is proving are temporarily withheld. The court then summoned Zhu Maocheng to the court. After he swore an oath, Zhu testified that he is currently a member of the Public Works Bureau Rickshaw Affairs Committee. He has known Zhu Shuqiao for over ten years. Around July 20th, when Zhu went to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, the committee was planning to organize a new license issuing agency and lacked someone to take charge. Knowing that Zhu was fair and enthusiastic, they planned to entrust Zhu with this matter. Subsequently, it was rumored that rickshaws might</p>
<p>(Experience turmoil), and according to the police department report, rickshaw business owners strongly opposed the new regulations, fearing that there might be a situation of vehicle shutdowns. The defendants in this case, except for Zhu Shuqiao, all went to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee to submit petitions requesting relief. Later, people claiming to be rickshaw pullers also came to oppose the new regulations, but the defendants denied that these people were representatives of rickshaw pullers. Because the newspapers could not publish the manuscripts they sent, they wanted to distribute leaflets and declarations. Fearing that they would take excessive action, Zhu Shuqiao came at the right time, and I instructed Zhu to guide them to get back on track and drafted a draft of the leaflets for them, but instructed them not to include any sentences that would disrupt public order. Two drafts of the leaflets drafted by Zhu were submitted to the court. Lawyer Wu Linkun immediately rose and requested that the court inquire about the identity of Zheng Guoliang, who testified in court last time. Judge Zhan immediately inquired about it. According to the answer, Zheng, representing the so-called Rickshaw Pullers' General Union, made some requests to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. Because the union did not have any</p>
<p>(Registration certificate), it could not be recognized as a legitimate organization. Later, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, and others submitted a petition denying that Zheng Guoliang was a representative of rickshaw pullers, requesting an investigation. On June 26, the patrol room sent a report to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, stating that Zheng Guoliang was inciting rickshaw pullers and was very close to the rickshaw industry association, receiving an annual subsidy of 1,000 yuan from the association. I am now giving a faithful statement to the court. It is rumored that someone will take unfavorable action against me. Please note this point to the court. Then, Wang Zhiren, a member of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, testified that Zhu Shuqiao was a teacher and this guidance was what we instructed. The rest of the testimony was mostly</p>
<p>(Same as Zhu Maocheng). To skip over details. Subsequently, rickshaw pullers Wang Er, Li San, and Wang A'er successively proved that between the hours of 8:00 AM and 8:30 PM on the 8th of this month, they met Zheng Fazhu on Haifang Road, Gordon Road, and Roberts Road, and Zheng instructed them to go to the Public Works Bureau with him on the morning of the 9th, and then Zheng ordered them to stop cars and deflate their tires, paying each person three dimes, and so on. Zheng Fazhu said that he did not know Wang and the other three people. At this point in the interrogation, it was around 1:00 PM. The court still had witnesses who had not been questioned, so the court ordered that the case be adjourned and heard again this afternoon at 2:00 PM. During the trial, Patrol Room Lawyer Ru and defendants' lawyers Wu and Yao repeatedly clashed over questioning the witnesses, which was very intense. It was stopped only after the court intervened.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Stamp Tax Bureau Letter to Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Cancel the time limit for waiving penalties for unstamped documents</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Sub-bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which stated: “To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the investigation of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco Bureau Order No. 733, which was approved by the Hebei Stamp Tax and Tobacco Bureau, and the report by Chen Yanhui, Director of the Beijing Stamp Tax Sub-bureau, stating that he had approved the request from the Beijing General Chamber of Commerce to follow the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau's method of handling time limits for unstamped documents for implementation. Although this method is convenient for merchants, it does not seem to be based on the regulations. I dare not make a decision on my own. I am sending the original letter for review and instructions. The Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau is under your jurisdiction. How do you handle the time limits for unstamped documents? A clear decision must be made. I am sending the original letter from the Beijing General Chamber of Commerce for your reference. Regarding the excerpt of the letter sent by the sub-bureau to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, it stated that the temporary method was set to ease the difficulties of merchants. Is this true? When was the aforementioned flexible method formulated, and why was it not reported to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce? Now, I am sending the original letter for your immediate compliance with the investigation and a prompt reply so that a reply can be drafted. This order includes the attached letter." I have checked the files of this bureau. In June of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), during the tenure of the previous sub-bureau chief, Song, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce approved the letter from the Rice Industry Association and others, requesting that all cases of unstamped invoices be limited to those that occurred within that year to avoid harassment. At that time, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants, a flexible method of checking invoices was formulated and sent to your association for distribution, and it was recorded and reported to the provincial bureau for review. Now, I have received Order No. 1869, which states that all the documents submitted have been reviewed. After the implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, all receipts, account books, and personnel certificates should be stamped. Failure to comply is a violation of the regulations. No matter when the violation is discovered, a penalty can be imposed according to the regulations. The case should be based on whether the evidence was established after the implementation of the regulations. Previously, in October of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), this bureau received a request from the Tongfeng Peixiao Dang Stamp Tax Sub-bureau requesting an explanation of the time period for evidence of violations of the regulations. The Tax Administration issued an order for compliance. It is now verified that the report states that during the tenure of the previous sub-bureau chief Song, the municipal Chamber of Commerce forwarded the request from the Rice Industry Association and others, and a flexible method of checking invoices was formulated. Although it was a temporary measure to ease the difficulties of merchants, it is not in accordance with the established regulations and was not approved for implementation, which is especially wrong. It should be corrected immediately to avoid differences. In addition to replying to the Hebei Stamp Tax and Tobacco Bureau, you must comply with the handling and inform the municipal Chamber of Commerce. This order includes the attached documents. In addition to complying with the order, I am sending this letter to inform you. Please investigate and inform us accordingly.”</p>

<p>Representatives petitioned the Chamber of Commerce yesterday</p>
<p>The various guilds of the tobacco and alcohol industries in this city have repeatedly convened joint meetings because the Finance Bureau dispatched personnel to investigate the license levels and the increased amounts were excessive. They have repeatedly petitioned the authorities without result. Yesterday, Chen Liangyu and Zhang Songji were elected as representatives to go to the Chamber of Commerce at 3:30 PM to request relief measures. Chairman Yu was out on official business, so Standing Committee Member Ma Shaoquan and Secretary Zhu Boyuan received them. The two representatives presented the facts of the doubled tax collection and handed over the list of taxpayer registrations of the tobacco exchange industry members to Mr. Zhu, requesting that it be forwarded to the Finance Bureau for a new investigation by personnel to thoroughly investigate and separately pay taxes according to the scope of business. It was adopted and reported to Chairman Yu, who reported it to the Finance Bureau for review. The representatives were satisfied. It is reported that the association will schedule a general meeting of representatives after a satisfactory reply to report on the progress.</p>

<p>Wuxi National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>Officially opens on September 1</p>
<p>Participating manufacturers depart on the 29th</p>
<p>The Wuxi National Goods Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Society, was originally scheduled to open on the 25th of this month. However, due to the fact that most of the participating factories are participating in the Zhenjiang Provincial National Goods Exhibition and the time is short, the opening has been rescheduled to September 1. The various circumstances learned by the Xinxin News reporter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Notice of Opening) The Wuxi National Goods Exhibition Preparatory Office issued a notice yesterday stating: "To whom it may concern, the exhibition was originally scheduled to open on August 15. However, due to requests from a majority of manufacturers for a postponement, the opening has been specially rescheduled to September 1. The following points are hereby notified. (1) Goods should be shipped from August 25 to 27. Please send them directly to the HSBC Transportation Company at the intersection of Jielu and Zhejiang Road for packing. There are three classes of shipping, with the highest class costing 5 dimes per load, the second class 4.5 dimes per load, and the third class 4 dimes per load. (2) Please come to the Preparatory Office before August 25 to collect badges and seals. (2) Please register the number of people going to Wuxi from each factory at the office before the 25th and pay the transportation fees so that train tickets can be purchased collectively. All site fees should also be paid together. (4) Please prepare a variety of small flags and leaflets for parade and publicity in Wuxi. (5) The departure is scheduled for 8:00 AM on August 29 at the Shanghai North Station. Discuss the methods on the train. After arriving in Wuxi, arrange the parade and rest at the venue. Set up will begin on August 30, and the opening will be on September 1. Wuxi hotels have contacted the Park Hotel, but manufacturers can also book their own hotels.</p>
<p>(Building Venues) The venue is located on Park Road in Wuxi, in a prosperous area, occupying a large area. The interior is divided into three parts: a temporary market, a national goods exhibition hall, and an amusement park. The original number of venues was more than 60. However, due to the enthusiastic participation of manufacturers in the city, the venues are insufficient and it has been decided to expand them, adding more than 50 venues, for a total of more than 110. Construction has begun and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>(Enthusiastic Registration) As of yesterday, the manufacturers participating include the Meixin Toothbrush Factory, Samsung Toothbrush Factory, Yuanchang Leather Factory, Fengli Umbrella Factory, Nanshengtai Cotton Weaving Factory, Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory, Dalong Wool Weaving Factory, Tiansheng Silk Factory, Minsheng Rubber Factory, May 30th Sock Factory, Weiqingxuan Candy Factory, Qunfu Fire Extinguisher Factory, Yong'an Industrial Society, and more than 60 others.</p>
<p>(Expanding Publicity) In order to promote national products and spread publicity, the association has built an amusement park at the venue, hired a local opera troupe to perform, and entrusted the Yongsheng Radio Station on Nanjing Road to broadcast music and the National Products Guide to publish a special issue of the Wuxi National Goods Exhibition to expand publicity and promote national products.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Wu Song Pig Industry Zone's Outlet Blocked <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>After the municipal government designated the area south of Wu Songbang and north of Zhou Tang as the Shanghai Pig Industry Zone, the pig stations in Songhu were ordered to move there one after another. All imported pig boats are unloaded there, and then the live pigs are transported to Shanghai by trucks for slaughter and sale, which is a large business. However, the vehicles must pass through the road within the railway area of the Wenzaobang Railway Station. Recently, the railway bureau sent police to block the passage, and the various pig firms felt that transportation was inconvenient. After the pigs were unloaded, there was a feeling of only coming in and not going out. They jointly appealed to the Wu Song Chamber of Commerce. After receiving the report, the Chamber of Commerce believed that since the area has been designated as a pig industry zone, it cannot be made impassable. A letter has been sent to the Municipal Works and Health Bureau to find a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Municipal Authorities <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibit the International Horse Racing Club</p>
<p>The club is a disguised gambling institution</p>
<p>The authorities did not approve the establishment in advance</p>
<p>After the International Horse Racing Club published advertisements in major newspapers in Shanghai to recruit a large number of female employees a month ago, it immediately attracted the attention of the local authorities. The advertisements were published for about a week and then disappeared. The authorities then put it aside. However, the club secretly continued to actively prepare, and arranged various facilities in the rented clubhouse, the Far East Sports Ground (i.e., the Yinxiang Village Racecourse). They purchased a large number of horse-drawn carts from abroad and recruited twenty or thirty European drivers, who arrived in Shanghai two weeks ago and practiced riding and galloping at the racecourse, considering the results to be satisfactory. The opening competition was scheduled for 8:00 PM on the 25th (i.e., tomorrow night). A few days ago, invitations were sent out on a large scale, inviting people from all walks of life in the city to visit at that time. After receiving the report, the municipal authorities learned that the club had not been approved in advance and did not know what kind of organization it was. They ordered an investigation. The results showed that the organization was a disguised gambling venue. The method of collecting money was even worse than general gambling. In addition to purchasing tickets for admission, tickets similar to exclusive seating were sold in the venue. The procedure for selling tickets was not the same as for horse racing, and the method of taking a cut was even more tricky and exploitative. This not only violates the regulations, but it is also necessary to strictly prohibit it. Therefore, it has been clearly prohibited.</p>

<p>Wednesday and Sunday at 9:00 PM</p>
<p>The Religious Philosophy Research Society on Buck Road in Shanghai aims to promote morality, study the true meaning of the five religions, and restore people's hearts. Since its establishment last year, it has achieved remarkable results and has been praised by all walks of life. It is recently heard that Mr. Xiao, the founder of the society, is scheduled to lecture on the Tao Te Ching every Wednesday and Sunday at 9:00 PM.

<h3 id="e193">Annual Tide Watching News <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The railway bureau opens special trains for six days this year</p>
<p>The Qiantang River autumn tide in Haining, Zhejiang, is the most magnificent in the world. When the tide arrives, it is like a snow mountain collapsing, a silver cliff collapsing, and tens of thousands of horses and soldiers galloping. When the tide is high, the wave peaks rise up, like a wall standing thousands of feet high, which is a spectacular sight. In previous years, the railway bureau opened special tide-watching trains for two or three days after the Mid-Autumn Festival to facilitate the audience. This year, the railway bureau, based on years of tide measurement experience, knows that there are often high tides after autumn. The tides are generally larger after the beginning and full moon of the lunar calendar. Therefore, the tide-watching date does not have to be limited to three days after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The date of tide watching is set for August 27, 28, September 11, 12, 26, and 27, a total of six days. In the past, special trains went to Xieqiao and then used civilian boats to go to Haining, which was time-consuming. This year, it was decided to specially order cars to wait at Chang'an Station. The audience can take the special express train to Chang'an every morning, transfer to cars, and arrive at the tide-watching platform in about half an hour. However, since there are not many cars, during the aforementioned tide-watching period, 150 car tickets will be sold daily within August, and 200 tickets will be sold daily within September. The round-trip car fare and the enclosure fee are 1.40 yuan per person. Train tickets can be purchased for sightseeing round-trip, 75% off for first and second class, and 85% off for third class. Ladies in Shanghai can take this opportunity to feast their eyes.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Telephone Directory to be Printed Soon <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Telephone Company publishes new telephone directories twice a year, in summer and winter. The winter edition for this year is now being prepared for printing. The number of copies, in Chinese and English, totals over 60,000. However, since the names included in the Chinese and English versions total over 80,000, the volume is large and printing is time-consuming.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Therefore, the registration of new user names has been set to close on September 10. Anyone who wants to include their name in the new telephone directory, or who needs to change their name, must register or notify immediately. Otherwise, the opportunity will be missed, and they will not be included. It will be delayed for another six months before it can be printed in the summer edition next year. Therefore, the number of people who have recently gone to the company to register for telephones and transfer accounts is extremely large, and those who have notified by telephone and letter are also coming one after another. The company's staff are having a hard time keeping up.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Zhao Xilin Assassination Case <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Culprit's Appeal Remanded for Retrial</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, a native of Changzhou and inspector at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill at 1690 Yangshupu Road, had been a detective in the Public Security Bureau in his hometown and had many enemies. At 6:45 AM on August 20th, 1931, he was shot and wounded near the mill. The assailant escaped under cover, and he was subsequently murdered by enemies a second time. Between October and November of the following year, Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective of the responsible constabulary, apprehended Tang Bingchang, Fang Renzhao, Wu Zhifang, and other three suspects, and handed them over to the First Special District Court. Tang was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, while Fang and Wu were acquitted. The constabulary, dissatisfied, presented ample evidence and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which changed Fang and Wu’s sentences to life imprisonment. Fang and Wu also hired lawyers to appeal to the Supreme Court. The case is now being remanded for retrial. Previously, the Putuo Road Constabulary had arrested Ren Haoming, a fellow gang member from Changzhou, and sent him to the Eighth Criminal Court for questioning. This was reported in this newspaper. The presiding judge, noting that the case had been handled by Detective Shen of the Yangshupu Constabulary, transferred Ren to their custody. Yesterday morning, Detective Shen presented Ren to the Third Criminal Court. Ru Bao Yi, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the events, stating that while the defendant had been identified as being at the scene of the first attack, the second attack could not be determined. Therefore, they were prosecuting him for attempted murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code and requested an extension for further investigation. The convicted defendant, Tang Bingchang, testified that he did not know the defendant and that his previous statements to the police and in court were false accusations. When questioned, the defendant completely denied the charges, stating that he was farming in his hometown at the time of Zhao's shooting and did not participate in it. Zhao Jiangshi, the deceased's concubine, stated that her husband, after being shot the first time, had identified the defendant as being at the scene while at Tongren Hospital. Judge Wu Zehan ordered the defendant to be remanded and the case to be reheard at a later date.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Regarding the article "The Truth About the Longhua Temple Lawsuit: Fang Cheng Flees," which our agency sent out yesterday, we have received a letter from Mr. Zhao Puchu of the Shanghai Buddhist Association, which reads: "Dear Editor, Today's newspapers published a conversation between me and your agency's reporter that contains many discrepancies. Apart from the investigation of the Longhua Temple situation, which has a file record, the claim that Fang Cheng was coerced into writing a letter of correction is a one-sided statement by Fang Cheng. I am not aware of the truth of the matter. I am writing to request that your agency forward this letter to the newspapers." In order to respect the speaker's wishes, our agency is sending this letter to your newspaper. We hope that you will publish it in the Letter to the Editor column. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Datong News Agency, August 23rd.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Some Questions from Books (Continued) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>——Answering Mr. Ye Lanpu's questions about family, private property, and the origin of the state</p>
<p>Q: Even so, before men are taught by their wives, they still think it possible (page 100). What teachings? What is possible?</p>
<p>A: This is saying that in a monogamous system, men are autocratic. Men can freely engage in affairs, while women cannot. In fact, women also have affairs. Before men are taught by the fact that women also commit adultery, they still think their autocracy is possible.</p>
<p>Q: (Page 101) Who are the German philistines? Who are the "French friends"?</p>
<p>A: This explains the resistance of wives to their husbands' domination under monogamy. For an explanation of the German philistines and the French friends, please refer to page 105, line 6 to page 106, line 9 of the book.</p>
<p>Q: To achieve this, the nature of the monogamous family as a socio-economic unit must be removed (page 111). And (page 114) it also says: "Prostitution disappears, and monogamy, far from declining, will eventually be realized." Are these two passages contradictory?</p>
<p>A: These two passages are not contradictory. We know that in capitalist society, the so-called monogamous nuclear family often sees women subjected to male domination because they cannot be economically independent. To achieve true equality between men and women, the "family nature" of monogamous families as socio-economic units must be removed, but not monogamy itself. The latter says that women in present society have become commodities, and marriage between men and women takes the form of buying and selling. Prostitution has become a special product of present society. Only when buying and selling marriages and prostitution are eliminated can true monogamy be realized.</p>
<p>Q: "Eros" (page 116), what is this?</p>
<p>A: Eros is the god of love in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Q: "Sexual love is by its very nature exclusive (page 124)." This sentence admits that sexual love is exclusive. However, what is said on pages 46 to 48 of the book says that human sexual love is not exclusive, but rather "leaves no room for jealousy." Is this not a contradiction of Engels?</p>
<p>A: Animal sexual life is exclusive, and so is that of humans. However, the form of human sexual life is determined by the social mode of production. In primitive communist society, the form of group marriage arose. The capitalist society's production requires formal freedom, thus giving rise to marriages based on formal freedom. Therefore, although human sexual love is exclusive in nature, this nature is realized with the development of social production. So this is not a contradiction of Engels, but a dialectical observation of materialism.</p>
<p>Q: "This is one side of the issue… Anything outside the tribe is outside the law… Later, it was only mitigated by private interests." What do these three sentences mean? (See page 152).</p>
<p>A: "This is one side of the issue" refers to the declining aspect of national societies. "Anything outside the tribe is outside the lawyer's concern." This means that in the era of national societies, tribes did not interact with each other, so anything outside the tribe was outside the law. "Mitigated by private interests" means that in the past, tribes met in war. The victorious tribe always killed or ate the defeated tribe. Later, with the development of productive forces, the victorious tribe found it more advantageous to keep the captured members of the defeated tribe as slaves for production rather than killing them all. The previous cruel behavior was thus mitigated by such private interests.</p>
<p>Q: The tribe is still a limit for mankind, both to itself and to those outside the tribe (page 152). What does this sentence mean? What is the limit?</p>
<p>A: In primitive society, tribes did not interact with each other. The gods worshiped or the systems implemented by each tribe were considered sacred and inviolable. These became a kind of boundary between them.</p>
<p>Q: The fact that ethnic groups are descended from a common ancestor has caused many troubles for "scholarly philistines" like Marx. (Page 160) How do you explain this? Has Marx become a "scholarly philistine"?</p>
<p>A: This is Si Min quoting the words of bourgeois scholars scolding Marx, so "scholarly philistine" is in parentheses.</p>
<p>Q: What is the "Pirate Age" (page 222)? A: It refers to the Pirate Age described in the world-weary Völsunga Saga.</p>
<p>Q: "We see this situation among the American Indians, which is the same as the obligation to receive guests" (page 225). This sentence does not seem to connect with the "fine" mentioned above. What does it mean exactly? What does "this situation" refer to?</p>
<p>A: The next sentence and the "fine" above are two different things. The above explains the relationship of enmity between relatives, and the below explains the relationship of love between relatives. "Seeing this situation" refers to the situation of "how to practice hospitality" as described by Tacitus.</p>
<p>Q: "Pattari (page 241), what is it?"</p>
<p>A: To explain the meaning of this term, one only needs to look at this sentence in the original book: "To lend to those who can only obtain one-sixth or only one-ninth of the labor productivity of the year is not called tenants, but rather managers of Pattari." Therefore, Pattari refers to those who only obtain one-sixth or only one-ninth of the labor productivity each year. People like this should not be called tenants, but rather managers. Pattari refers to the people who are called "managers." The original text is in Latin.</p>
<p>Q: Guo Moruo said on page 5 of the introduction to "A Study of Ancient Chinese Society" that "the invention of iron completely destroyed matrilineal ethnic societies." Now, according to pages 261 and 263 of this book, the destruction of matrilineal ethnic groups was in the middle of barbarism, while the invention of iron was in the upper stage of barbarism. Is Guo wrong?</p>
<p>A: Guo is not wrong. Guo said: "The invention of iron completely destroyed matrilineal ethnic societies." Attention should be paid to the words "completely." The collapse of a society is never sudden; it is a gradual change to a sudden change. "Men gradually occupied the center in biological terms, and matrilineal society began to collapse, but it was with the use of iron tools in agriculture that matrilineal society reached the stage of complete destruction." —End—</p>

<h3 id="e207">Do Not Castrate the Mass Language <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>I happened to hear from a friend that Mr. Wang Maozu recently expressed his opinion that he also agrees with the mass language. This seems to be an "unexpected" event. Mr. Wang, the strongest supporter of classical Chinese, also agrees with the mass language! However, upon closer examination, it is not surprising.</p>
<p>Before the emergence of "May Fourth"-style vernacular Chinese, there were two tools for spreading ideas and consciousness in China: one was classical Chinese, and the other was the mass language. Poems, essays, and policy discourses written in classical Chinese were for scholars to read; popular tunes, Suzhou ballads, storytelling, etc., created in the mass language were for the illiterate masses. Both were consistent in conveying the feudal ideology of the scriptures and sages. At that time, the "rulers" used classical Chinese to recruit officials on the one hand, and "approved" of Suzhou ballads, storytelling, popular tunes, and drum songs, etc., in the mass language on the other.</p>
<p>However, the "New Youth" wanted to promote "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," which was a great betrayal of the "scriptures and sages." Therefore, the "New Youth" became the target of attacks by the classical Chinese faction. Although Chen Duxiu's "On Literary Revolution" was still written in classical Chinese, Lin Qinnan and his colleagues did not forgive him because it was in "classical Chinese." Mr. Lin Qinnan and his colleagues were very clear about what they wanted to defend.</p>
<p>Now, "May Fourth"-style vernacular Chinese has been in use for more than ten years. Things wrapped in the "feudal zombies" of this vernacular Chinese coat have become increasingly prevalent. The disciples of the sages seem to be able to rest assured. However, because vernacular Chinese has become the only tool for "undesirables" to express their thoughts, and the internal contradictions of society are becoming more and more acute, "those with a mind" like Mr. Wang cannot help but "speak out righteously." Mr. Wang and his colleagues are also very clear about what they want to defend. If someone argues with Mr. Wang about the merits of "classical" versus "vernacular," I know Mr. Wang will definitely laugh secretly.</p>
<p>Then came the loud fanfare of the mass language issue. You punch, I kick, and the vernacular Chinese is criticized as only fit to be thrown into the cesspool. Among them, most are sincerely pioneering for the mass language, but there are also many who are using it as a scapegoat for classical Chinese. Their triumphant argument is that the mass language should not come into contact with new things—extremely rejecting new spoken language and new forms. They ostensibly regard the mass language as sacred, but in reality, they lock it in a dark room and prevent it from progressing by contacting new things. The new mass language has not yet been produced, and they want to castrate it first! May I ask, if the current mass spoken language does not have a large amount of new elements representing new ideas added to it, how can it bear its special mission in culture? Therefore, those debaters who advocate that "the mass language rejects new things" want the mass language to stagnate at the current feudal stage; no wonder Mr. Wang also approves of such a "mass language."</p>
<p>Now we often hear people shouting: "Bring out the goods!" Regardless of whether this shout is well-intentioned or malicious, the "goods" will be brought out sooner or later. However, these "goods" must not be a "copy" of the mass spoken language. It cannot cater to the low cultural level of the masses; it must raise the cultural level of the masses. On the negative side, it should eliminate those mass spoken languages full of feudal consciousness; on the positive side, it should inject new elements. We cannot regard the masses as very stupid and very stubborn, the so-called "ignorant people" of the past. The masses are very good at learning and very much in need of learning. The masses have long known from the lessons of life to abandon the old and accept the new.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Why Ask So Many Questions <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>Every time I see an adult putting on a fierce and tyrannical face, wielding a rattan cane to intimidate an ignorant child, while asking, "Are you afraid? Do you dare?" I indifferently judge it to be a very clumsy training method. The adult is happy. The child does not yet know where to complain about this abuse. If the door is locked and the rattan cane is applied, even with a belly full of grievances, the answer can only be the one that is currently advantageous.</p>
<p>It is also like a very stupid horse trainer riding a horse. The whip is raised, and they beat it wildly without asking the reason, while asking, "Will you go? Will you go?" Even if the horse is extremely stubborn, momentary victory is still certain to belong to the horse trainer.</p>
<p>If you think about it calmly, the adult and the horse trainer use "Are you afraid? Do you dare? Will you go?" in this way to solicit opinions from the victims, it can only strengthen their resentment and is of no benefit. At most, it only shows that the adult and the horse trainer lack reason more than their subjects, and they like such a cruel and perverse game.</p>
<p>On the surface, whether voluntary or not, the answers "go," "afraid," and "dare not" are always found, although a bit hazy. However, because of this haziness, the root of the disaster is deeply planted. In the blink of an eye, the child will pour kerosene into the drawer and pee on the bed, and the stubborn horse will be able to throw its rider to the ground or into the rocky and rugged ravines.</p>
<p>Recently, Hitler of Germany ordered all the people to vote for him as president, and the situation is similar. In fact, he can decide for himself what he wants to be and what he wants to do. There is no need to ask others, and others do not have time or are unable to ask him.</p>
<p>But he wants to ask: "Do you approve or disapprove?"</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called election under his rule is just a boring program; an election that only allows one person to be selected, otherwise the vote is invalid, so why should the people go to the trouble? However, in this ineffective game, as many as one-tenth of the voters insisted on expressing their opposition, and this phenomenon was naturally dissatisfied with by the Hitler party. Therefore, the official newspaper of the National Socialist Party "attacked" and published an article called "A Word to Those Who Vote Against." It said that since as many as thirty-eight million people approve of Hitler, how can these few opponents do harm, "This is no different from a child shaking an iron pillar, only showing that he is overestimating himself," etc. Comparing the more than seven million voters to a child is another creation. But this child can not be afraid of fierce and tyrannical faces, and speak out loudly, and shake the iron pillar with his hands, and it can be imagined how ignorant they are, even though they have opposing opinions.</p>
<p>A certain free writer once quoted Shakespeare's works to prove that the masses are always blind, and I think these seven million Germans who shake the iron pillar can testify for him. So, why should the enlightened leader of Germany ask so many questions of the blind guys?</p>
<h3 id="e209">"Twilight on the Pier" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fei</p>
<p>People say that Qingdao is good in the summer, and this is really not a lie.</p>
<p>I won't talk about Huiquan Beach, Zhanshan Listening to the Waves, the lotus pavilions in the park, or the secluded paths in the mountains, those big places. Let me just talk about that long pier lying in the front sea at dusk. Speaking of it, it is enough to make some friends in other places envious.</p>
<p>The bridge is so long, long in the heart of the sea; from beginning to end, it is more than half a mile long, so some people also call it the long wharf. The newly built Biluo Hongqiang Huilan Pavilion sits high on the bridgehead, and from a distance, it looks like a long white-clothed girl wearing a pearl phoenix crown. When the tide comes, the waves fly up and land on the faces of the tourists on the bridge. No wonder some timid children have to tighten the corners of their parents' clothes and cry out: "Dad! The bridge is going to be washed into the bottom of the sea!"</p>
<p>Once the courtyard is filled with bats flapping their wings in the twilight, the silver light cast by the white porcelain light bulbs on the bridge has been trampled by the footprints of tourists.</p>
<p>On the bridge, there are young lovers strolling and whispering, and there are strong men from foreign countries singing in a drunken state. However, there are also young people leaning against the railing with a pair of eyes worrying about the sky. They should be hearing the yoyo calls of the water birds in the sea, and thinking of the few strands of white hair on the temples of their old mothers in their hometown courtyards. Seeing the faint Silver Han hanging on the top of the sky, they miss the heart of that young woman under the lonely lamp in the deep boudoir. They should be recalling the heroic career of leaping horses on the battlefield and pulling flags on the city walls when they heard the surging waves in the sea. Or they heard a faint fisherman's song floating from afar, recalling the little childhood heart of picking lotus and fishing by the green grass pond and catching fireflies with a small fan under the bright moon in front of the flowers. Or they are grieving over some tenderness when they whispered at the bridgehead and paddled in pairs in the waves.</p>
<p>These are all heartbroken people, lingering on the pier.</p>

<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(1) Beginning</p>
<p>I heard that this year's heat in Shanghai is unprecedented in sixty years. I go out to make a living during the day and go home with my head down at night. It is still hot in the house, and there are mosquitoes. At this time, only the outside of the door is paradise. Because of the seaside, there is always some wind, so there is no need to fan. Although we know each other somewhat, the neighbors living in the attic or mezzanine nearby, whom we don't often see, also sit out. Some of them are clerks, some are proofreaders in bookstores, and some are skilled draftsmen. Everyone is exhausted and complaining, but at this time, they are still relatively free, so they also chat idly.</p>
<p>The scope of idle chat is not small: talking about drought, praying for rain, flirting, talking about three-inch dwarves, talking about foreign rice, talking about bare legs, talking about classical Chinese, talking about vernacular Chinese, talking about the mass language. Because I have written a few vernacular articles, they especially want to hear what I have to say about classical Chinese, so I have to say more about it. After two or three nights like this, it was finally diverted to other topics, and it was finally finished. Unexpectedly, after a few days, a few people still wanted me to write it out.</p>
<p>Among them, some believed me because I had read a few ancient books, some because I had read a little foreign books, and some because I had read both ancient and foreign books: but a few people therefore did not believe me, saying that I was a bat. When I talked about classical Chinese, he smiled and said, you are not one of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, how can I believe you? When I talked about the mass language, he smiled and said: you are not the working masses, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>This is also true. When we talked about the drought, we talked about an old master going to the countryside to investigate the disaster, saying that some places could have avoided the disaster, but the disaster occurred because the farmers were lazy and did not bail water. However, a newspaper recorded an old man in his sixties who died because his son was too weak to bail water, and the disaster was still the same, so he committed suicide because there was no way to go. The opinions of the old master and the villagers are really so different. Then, my nighttime talk is probably just idle talk from a passerby.</p>
<p>After the hurricane, the weather was a little cooler, but I finally wrote it out according to the wishes of the few people who hoped I would write it out. It is much simpler than spoken language, but roughly the same, and can be considered copied for people like us to read. At the time, I only relied on memory: I quoted ancient books indiscriminately, and words were like wind in my ears. Mistakes don't matter, but writing them on paper made me very hesitant, but I was also troubled by the fact that I didn't have the original books to compare. I can only ask the readers to correct me at any time.</p>

<p>In the coffers of my heart, I have dropped a coin. Time will not take it, petty thieves will not steal—it is a safe and cherished memory, better than making a golden crown for an emperor.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Old Man (10) (2) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Those who were consulted were also blushing and shaking their heads, and no one could give him satisfaction. Among the White Russians, more people knew French than English. It was still Shirov, who had once performed ventriloquism at the Royal Academy of Music, who made a living by selling his art and had wandered in Europe and the United States for many years, who told him the words on it. He also said that in the United States, he had met Sasha, whose good voice had captivated the Americans. He had already married a wife, and the woman was still a princess from the old Russian era. He listened to Shirov saying these words in tears. He enthusiastically took his hand and hoped to know a little more about it. He also said that if he didn't mind, he could invite him to drink some vodka. But Shirov thanked him and said that he had another appointment, so he said goodbye to him.</p>
<p>After Shirov left, he suddenly regretted it. He thought he should have asked where he lived, because he could go and talk to him about Sasha. He wanted to know more about Sasha's recent situation, but he could determine it in his expectation: Sasha was able to get drunk in the evening of the previous year.</p>
<p>He was happy for this good news. He imagined how happy the successful Sasha was and how many beautiful praises were waiting for him, which made his spirit have glorious decorations. His family would also be noticed, and he himself would be mentioned, and Sasha would say this.</p>
<p>"My old grandfather—"</p>
<p>What kind of words would Sasha use to describe him? Would he go on to say: "A completely stubborn old man!"</p>
<p>Thinking like this, he became unbearably annoyed. He thought Sasha could say that. When he left him, didn't Sasha clearly use "old, worn-out park" to describe everything about him? Then isn't it easy to say that he is also a very old and outdated person, to be forever locked in that dilapidated environment, and not even allowed to breathe freely? To make him a young man of the nineteenth century, rigid and never knowing to let him spend a happy youth. ——</p>
<p>Thinking of these things, his tears flowed down. He could swear to heaven with his old age that he was so loved by Sasha. He loved him more than every grandfather loved his own grandson, but he couldn't stand this world. Could Sasha understand him? Could he know that he loved him so much?</p>
<p>For so many days, only Sasha's shadow was turning in his mind. Excessive thinking made him feel tired. Wasn't he already so old? He should just live quietly and wait for the end to come. He already knew that Sasha was living well, so he didn't need to think about it anymore. As long as he doesn't bring shame to his name, what else is there to love?</p>
<p>He slowly turned his body and looked at all the goods piled on the ground, hanging on the walls, and stuffed in the wooden shelves. They were so familiar to him that they all seemed to say to him in a friendly way: "Rest, old man, we should all rest."</p>
<p>This was almost a language that only he could understand. He nodded, touched this, and moved that, and his heart felt peaceful and joyful again. Thinking in his heart: "Buy some sausage and drink some wine!"</p>
<p>It was dark again outside. The night was swallowing the remaining daylight in one bite after another, and the sun had sunk weakly into the lower layer of the earth.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Ministry of Education Order Issued <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Amended Regulations on the Treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan Students</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, as well as the Mongolian and Tibetan banners and clans, and national and registered private universities, stating: The Ministry previously promulgated the Regulations on the Treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan Students in February of the 18th year of the Republic of China. Subsequently, considering that the cultural development of provinces such as Xikang, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Gansu was relatively backward, the Ministry approved the students from the aforementioned provinces to be eligible for all or part of the treatment stipulated in the previous regulations, and a directive was issued accordingly. Recently, due to the inadequacy of the aforementioned measures, the original Regulations on the Treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan Students have been amended. This amendment was jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan through the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and then forwarded to the National Government for approval. The Executive Yuan's Directive No. 2363 states: "All submitted documents have been noted and approved for record. The matter has also been reported to the National Government for record. The Ministry should immediately promulgate and implement these regulations. Inform accordingly." Therefore, in addition to the Ministry's promulgation, the amended Regulations on the Treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan Students are hereby copied and issued for your information and compliance.</p>

<p>Will Open</p>
<p>Jointly Operated by the Children's Welfare Association and the Children's Library</p>
<p>One in Nanshi, One in Zhabei, Opening on September 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee and the Shanghai Children's Morning Post, to promote children's reading and increase children's knowledge, have jointly established two children's libraries, one in the Nanshi district and one in the Zhabei district of this city. Preparations have been completed, and the official opening is scheduled for September 1st. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled Opening: The first children's library is located in the He'an Elementary School in Zhabei, with Zhao Zengqi as the librarian. The second children's library is located at No. 6 Panfang Road, near Penglai Road in Nanshi, with Qian Fugong as the librarian. The second library is scheduled to open on September 1st, as reported in previous news. According to Zhao Zengqi, the librarian of the first library, that library is also scheduled to open simultaneously on September 1st, and a joint opening ceremony will be held at He'an Elementary School. Mayor Wu, Director Pan, and people from all walks of life are invited to participate to promote the initiative. The city's major bookstores have donated more than 2,000 books. After the opening, recruitment will continue. The first library is located in Zhabei, an area with factories and shops, so the reading audience will focus on apprentices and workers. Therefore, the mobile lending method is better. The second library is located in Nanshi, a school area, so it will focus on in-library reading.</p>
<p>Mobile Lending Method: The mobile lending experiment method of the first library is recorded below: (1) To meet the needs of society and seek universal efficiency, this library will implement a mobile lending method. (2) The target audience for mobile lending of books is temporarily limited to apprentices in shops and factories, but if necessary, it may also be extended to other children depending on actual needs. (3) The books for mobile lending will be designated by this library. (4) The books for mobile lending will be delivered daily by the library in book carts to designated areas, allowing apprentices from various shops and factories to choose and borrow books. (5) The lending of mobile book carts will require the library to prepare a borrowing ledger, which should be filled out clearly by the borrower and stamped by the shop or factory where they work as a guarantee. The guarantor will be responsible for compensation for any damage or loss. (6) The lending period for mobile books is three days. Upon expiration, the library will send personnel to collect the books. However, with the permission of the library, the period may be extended for another three days, but only once. (7) If a borrower does not meet the requirements of these measures, the library may refuse to lend or suspend their borrowing rights in the future. (8) These measures will be implemented after being approved by the Standing Chairman of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee and the President of the Shanghai Children's Morning Post.</p>

<p>Rev. Litzia Arrested in Japan</p>
<p>(Shen Shi News Agency, Local News) The arrest of Rev. Dr. Litzia, a professor at Aurora University and a doctor at Guangci Hospital, in Japan has attracted the attention of many people. According to the academic dean of Aurora University, Dr. Litzia is fond of photography and has a very proud temper. He often takes long trips during summer vacations. He has traveled to Japan several times, but he has no political background whatsoever. Calling him a military spy is simply not true. Aurora University and the French Consulate have not received any official reports regarding Rev. Litzia's arrest. Reports that the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai sent someone to Aurora University yesterday to investigate Rev. Litzia's behavior are untrue. Rev. Litzia's arrest may be due to his stubborn temper or because he took landscape photos and did not heed the unreasonable prevention of the Japanese police, leading to his arrest.</p>

<p>Children's Health Camp (3)</p>
<p>Sufficient Rest: Excessive exercise and lack of rest are not desirable for health. In addition to nutrition and exercise, do not forget rest. John Hilton wrote a book titled "Rest" in 1866, explaining that our growth and repair of damaged cells occur during rest, and the natural recovery of energy and transportation of fatigue toxins also occur during rest. Rest includes sleep. Donald A. Laird &amp; Charles G. Muller co-authored a book titled "Sleep," explaining the need for sleep. Logically, elementary school children should sleep at least ten hours or more, but in reality, it is not sufficient. Children, like kittens and puppies, often need opportunities for rest. In the camp, lights are out at 8:30 PM and wake-up is at 6:00 AM. There is rest from 11:00 AM to 11:40 AM. A moment of quiet listening to music before meals, a nap from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM in the afternoon, listening to music a moment before 4:00 PM, and walks and storytelling after 7:00 PM. Most of the stories are health-related stories. Once, I told the story of Pasteur's patriotic motivation in inventing sterilization, treating rabies, preserving wine with heat sterilization, and developing the inoculation method for treating sheep plague. The children listened with great interest. I felt that stories like this are worth promoting. The most difficult thing in the children's camp is sleep. Initially, it was planned not to use maids and have the instructors serve, but it failed. Now, each instructor lives in the dormitory and manages six children. At night, three maids take turns covering the children with blankets. Officer Yu Geng gets up at night to supervise. According to the survey, Wusong has a lot of malaria, so starting from the fourth week, we have started taking quinine for prevention. The method is to choose one day a week, once after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, one pill each time, to reduce germs.</p>
<p>Hygiene Habits: Actions speak louder than words, especially when it comes to hygiene. Hygiene knowledge should be as rich as possible, but what is the use if it is not put into practice? Life in our camp is completely hygienic. We drink plenty of water every day, do not use other people's towels, go to bed early and wake up early, eat meals at regular times... and so on. We follow the rules strictly. However, they found that some children have very bad old habits that they brought in when the camp started, such as running and jumping after meals, reading in bed, not exercising outdoors, putting fingers in their mouths, not eating green vegetables, refusing to take naps, dressing sloppily, not cutting their nails, and wiping their eyes with their hands. So, the instructors investigated various weaknesses within two weeks, discussed a set of slogans, distinguishing between desirable and undesirable habits, and posted and implemented them in stages in a very simple and easy way. We also formulated seven healthy habits: (1) Nutrition, (2) Exercise, (3) Rest, (4) Cleanliness, (5) Sunlight, (6) Air, and (7) Posture. In the United States and Britain, posture is included in exercise, but here the children's posture is very bad, with the spine bent more often than straight, so we specifically mention it to alert them and make corrections easier. Here, I will introduce our corrective posture exercise tutorial below.</p>
<p>Corrective Exercise Tutorial Table</p>
<p>Week               Course</p>
<p>Week 1         1. Corrective posture (sitting, standing, walking) 2. Leg activities (crawling movements)</p>
<p>Week 2         1. Local muscle relaxation 2. Same as Week 1</p>
<p>Week 3         1. Abdominal muscle activity 2. Same as Week 2</p>
<p>Week 4         1. Muscle arc activity 2. Same as Week 3</p>
<p>Week 5         1. Muscle stretching activity 2. Same as Week 4</p>
<p>Week 6         1. Full body massage, stretching, relaxation, and jumping 2. Investigate each child's muscles (review all of the above sections)</p>
<p>In addition, we have formulated ten hygiene rules and combined them with the above-mentioned seven healthy habits, etc., to be checked and scored by teachers and students together to encourage them. By the fourth week, the children had a thorough understanding of the meaning of health. Everyone then took an oath, swearing to abide by the seven healthy habits... and to practice them faithfully according to the camp life. This kind of oath develops a healthy attitude in children, making them happy to accept and implement healthy behaviors.</p>

<p>Owner allegedly mortgaging for over one million yuan</p>
<p>A major blow to the future of the Sports Association</p>
<p>After the All-China Athletic Federation moved from Father Rahm Road to the Shen Garden football field, it began expanding the facilities, planning to construct tennis courts, basketball courts, and track and field facilities. However, recent reports indicate that the owner of the Shen Garden dog racing track suddenly mortgaged the land for over one million yuan. If this is true, the future of the Sports Association seems even more uncertain. According to a source at the Sports Association, the association is unaware of this matter. However, when the association first moved to Shen Garden, it began expanding and constructing, with tennis courts already under construction. The stands around the football field were also moved back in preparation for building the track. However, after the stands were relocated, the director, Shen Siliang, suddenly ordered the construction to be temporarily halted for unknown reasons. The rumors of the land being mortgaged seem to confirm Shen Siliang's words.</p>

<p>Request the Promulgation of Curriculum Standards</p>
<p>To unify the content of each subject and facilitate the joint examination</p>
<p>In view of the Ministry of Education's requirement to conduct joint examinations starting this year, the various private physical education teacher training schools in this city have jointly requested the Municipal Education Bureau to forward a request to the Ministry of Education to promulgate the physical education teacher training curriculum standards as soon as possible. This is because the Ministry has not yet issued these standards, leaving the schools at a loss as to what to teach and causing extreme difficulties. Among the various sciences in our country today, physical education is arguably the most unsystematic and the curriculum is the most chaotic. Often, the content taught at school A is completely different from that taught at school B. Even within the same school, two teachers teaching the same subject often use different materials. This situation poses many obstacles to the future of the joint examination. Therefore, the schools are united in requesting the Ministry to issue the standards as soon as possible so that they can be followed and the law can be respected.</p>

<p>The China Swimming Association initiated a sea crossing competition. The first attempt was changed to a performance due to high winds and waves. However, a tragedy occurred on that day. A participant in the performance was swept into the sea by the waves and drowned. No one noticed at the time. It was discovered later, but it was too late to save him. Another Westerner was swept away by the waves, but fortunately, several good swimmers noticed and rescued him, averting a disaster.</p>
<p>The well-known young tennis player, Mr. Yu Tianguang, was engaged to Ms. Lianlian, the niece of Mr. Liu Hongsheng, on the 5th of this month.

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Ghosts Transport Distant Guests from Guanzhong / Impoverished Families Cross the Ferry to Mourn the Qin People</p>
<p>Only Zhang Jiefu understood. He replied, "Anything is fine, but not having electric lights is a drawback." Wang Laowu said, "The train will be running in the second half of the year. When that happens, there will naturally be electric lights." Li Shilian, hearing this, suddenly became excited and forgot about the dirt on his clothes. He said to Zhang Jiefu, "I thought of a business to do in Tongguan. If we start now, we can definitely make a fortune." Zhang Jiefu, hearing that there was a business to make money, also paid attention and asked, "What business are you talking about?" Li Shilian said, "When I was in Tongguan, I heard people there say that the area next to the train station used to be an open space, but since the train arrived, it immediately became a street. Needless to say, the price of land there is now several times higher than before. Now, while the train is not yet running, we should quickly buy some land near the Xi'an train station, leave it for a year and a half, and when the train arrives, we can double our investment. I think this business is the most reliable." Zhang Jiefu said, "Who hasn't thought of that? A friend of mine bought several thousand dollars worth of land last year." Li Shilian said, "He bought it last year? Your friend has a really far-sighted eye." Zhang Jiefu hadn't replied yet when Wang Laowu suddenly interrupted, shouting, "Duck your heads! Duck your heads! Quick!" Although Zhang and Li had already heard him shouting, they were still somewhat confused. Before they could observe anything, the cart had already entered a clump of willow trees. Zhang Jiefu, being shorter, only had willow leaves brushing his face. Li Shilian, with most of his body in the willow branches, was fortunate to be sitting backwards, avoiding the branches with his face. Apart from the heavy brush of the branches on his back, the felt hat he had brought from Shanghai, traveling thousands of miles, was knocked off by the branches, dozens of feet away. Li Shilian, injured several times in a short while, was somewhat flustered. Although his hat had been knocked far away, he didn't even know it. (IV)</p>
<h3 id="e242">Pipa Ballad and Legends <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Bai Letian's "Pipa Ballad" is a masterpiece of poetry, evoking sympathy for "fellow sufferers from the ends of the earth, why must we have known each other before?" However, the existence of this story has been questioned. Hong Rongzhai himself thought it was a fabrication, and Zhao Oubei didn't believe it either. But in any case, the story is very simple and very bland. He clearly said "why must we have known each other before?", indicating that they had never met. Yet three busybodies fabricated many details, developing them into three legends.</p>
<p>The first one is Ma Zhiyuan's "Blue Gown Tears" of the Yuan Dynasty, which says that the merchant's wife playing the pipa was a prostitute whom Letian had known before. They reunited in Jiangzhou and their broken mirror was mended. They even gave them names, calling her Fei Xingnu and the tea merchant Liu Yilang.</p>
<p>The second one is Gu Dian's "Blue Gown Notes" of the Ming Dynasty. He felt that "Blue Gown Tears" portrayed Letian as a playboy, which was somewhat inappropriate, so he added many twists and turns, saying that Fei Xingnu initially intended to marry Letian, but was forced by her mother to marry Liu Yilang instead. "Blue Gown Tears," however, says that Fei Xingnu mistakenly believed Liu Yilang's false message that Letian had died, and thus reluctantly followed him. This is to elevate Fei Xingnu's position.</p>
<p>The third one is Jiang Zangyuan's "Four-String Autumn" of the Qing Dynasty, which severely attacked "Blue Gown Notes," believing that "the intention and diction are quite damaging to elegance," and not as good as "Blue Gown Tears." However, "Four-String Autumn" itself is not particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>People in the Ming Dynasty liked to revamp Song and Yuan zaju into Southern operas, unwilling to start anew and find new paths. This was the fashion of the time. "Blue Gown Notes" could not avoid this trend and had its debatable aspects. However, the structure of its story was not too distorted and could still preserve some of the essence of "Pipa Ballad." "Four-String Autumn" was almost completely changed from its original appearance. Although the plot was indeed rationalized, a symbolic romantic poem was transformed into a realistic scholar's story. No wonder the Pipa Pavilion in Jiangzhou became a love souvenir for Bai Letian.</p>

<p>Modern ladies and young ladies: If you want to bare your legs, just bare them. Why do you have to apply perfume and cream? If you want to go barefoot, just go barefoot. Why do you have to dye your toenails with impatiens? You should know that this perfumed oil, this cream, this impatiens, are all the brainpower and sweat of your husbands and fathers.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Hawker Wang Er <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shoutong</p>
<p>The midnight storm awakened the hawker Wang Er. His cough started again, coughing incessantly. He thought to himself that these days, the weather had been so hot, and he had been running around all day, so it was natural to be tired. Yesterday, he happened to fall asleep under a tree, caught a chill, and it had triggered his old ailment. People who are getting old are useless after all, Wang Er thought, and couldn't help but feel a little sad, and a rattling sound came from his throat again.</p>
<p>Wang Er felt his throat dry and extremely uncomfortable. He slowly sat up and groped in the darkness for the teapot placed on the table. Unfortunately, his head was dizzy, and his legs were so weak that they seemed unable to support his upper body. How could he take another step? He could only sit on the edge of the bed and sigh deeply.</p>
<p>The sound of chickens crowing incessantly filled the fields, and the sky gradually turned white. A faint light entered Wang Er's home, illuminating all his dilapidated belongings, illuminating the empty grain in the broken wooden bucket, and illuminating the unsold melons and fruits lying in the bamboo basket. At this time, he did not have the thought of his own destruction, but still wanted to move forward on the path of survival, and could only struggle with fate with his sick body, waiting to obtain a meager profit to comfort his stomach.</p>
<p>The raindrops outside the house fell even harder. Wang Er didn't care about these things, dragging his heavy legs, holding an umbrella in one hand and carrying a basket in the other, staggering step by step towards the road to the village market, looking for customers for his melons and fruits. Before long, he was shrouded in rain, and even his shadow could not be seen.</p>

<p>— Feng Zhongmou</p>
<p>Now that autumn is here, many people who have been suffering from summer heat are already experiencing its effects, whether it is autumn fever, malaria, or dysentery. Although the symptoms are different, the cause is the same. My teacher, Mr. Xie Liheng (residing in Meifu Lane, Parker Road), is considered an expert in treating autumn fever and hidden evil diseases, and he has a unique view on treating dysentery. He often said that although dysentery is a serious disease, as long as the procedures are not messed up, it is not difficult to achieve a cure within a specified period. The so-called procedures are that it is appropriate to purge at the beginning, then harmonize, then clear, and finally supplement in the late stage. If you treat according to the order, you can always recover. However, if patients seek a quick cure or prevent exhaustion, and smoke opium to relieve temporary pain, it often leads to prolonged and incurable illnesses. This is because the disease is mostly caused by summer dampness accumulating in the intestinal folds. The more stagnation there is, the more severe the pain will be. Only by cleansing the dirt and opening the stagnation can the disease be removed and the dysentery stopped. If you take opium to astringe it, making the toxic evil even more imprisoned in the two intestines, it is no different from recognizing a thief as a son and raising a thief behind closed doors. Doctors use medicine to expel it, and patients use smoke to keep it. Expelling and keeping contradict each other, so the toxic stagnation does not go away, and the intestinal wall becomes more easily corrupted. Moreover, dysentery is caused by hidden summer heat, and the medicine used for purging will damage the stomach yin early on. If you then dry it with opium smoke, you will not be able to eat, turning into a closed mouth, which is also incurable. Although opium is a toxic substance, it is not impossible to treat diseases, but it is absolutely opposed to dysentery. Even if long-term dysentery becomes deficient, there are some who use poppy husks, but they are a minority. Therefore, it is most dangerous for smokers to suffer from dysentery. Therefore, when they see ordinary people suffering from dysentery and smoking to be safe for the moment, they all earnestly advise them to abstain. This is Mr. Xie's decades of experience, which is why he often has remarkable effects in treating dysentery. This year, there is a particularly large number of dysentery cases, and I lament the lack of common knowledge in the public, so I wrote this to inform the patients.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Radium: Can Cure Diseases and Kill People <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>Low production, high value: Those who have studied chemistry all know that radium, also known as radon, was invented by the French great scientists, the Curies. Recently, Madame Curie has passed away, and we should have a real understanding of radium. The quantity of radium is very scarce, but its value is extremely expensive. At present, there are only 500 grams (an English unit of weight) in the world, and each gram is worth 15,000 British pounds (one pound is now equivalent to 13 or 14 yuan to 15 or 16 yuan in Chinese currency). The 500 grams in the world are worth 7.5 million British pounds. Sixty-eight grams of it are in the UK, worth one million British pounds. Twenty-one grams of it are managed by the National Committee. All medical research and commercial applications that require radium are distributed equally by this National Committee. Most of the radium in the UK is obtained from the Chinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo (in Africa). The radium production of this mine is strictly managed and restricted, so that the standard price of radium is always maintained, so that it will not decrease due to increased production, or increase due to reduced production. Therefore, 61 grams were produced in 1930, but it was reduced to only 44 grams in 1932.</p>
<p>Can cure diseases and kill people: This scarce and expensive radium has great authority in medicine and can cure many difficult and complicated diseases. The most effective ones are reducing malignant tumors and other malignant sores. However, there are advantages and disadvantages to everything, and radium is no exception. On the negative side, radium is the most deadly and dangerous of toxic substances. The poisonous gas and deadly bacteria in the modern chemical warfare killing weapons imagined by the great British writer H.G. Wells in his "The War of the Worlds," and Welloian's death ray are far less secretive, unpredictable, and effective than radium in killing people. With this new poison, using arsenic to poison people seems like a barbaric and primitive method.</p>
<p>Slow poison, seeing ghosts: According to the warning of Lord Lee of Fareham, one gram of radium in a small, slender-necked bottle is enough to kill a neighbor living in a semi-detached house through the wall, and without leaving any trace. The family of the deceased and the detectives of the police station will never suspect you. One-hundredth of a gram (one-thousandth of a gram) of radium is about the size of a grain of sand, absorbing it into the human body, at first there is no dramatic change and no discomfort, but later it will emit a terrible toxicity that will kill people suddenly. In the New Jersey area of the United States, there was a murder case in which the secret killer was radium. It turned out that in a factory that manufactured luminous watches, dozens of female workers were hired to specialize in teaching them to use brushes to apply a chemical containing a very small amount of radium to the surface, so that the watch could glow in the dark. The brushes they used, dipped in the chemical containing radium, were often licked with the tip of the tongue to sharpen the brush after one or two applications, which had almost become a habit. At that time, it didn't feel like anything, but after four or five years, when they were dismissed and left the factory, disaster struck. The remaining radium sulfate on the brush had all precipitated into their bones, where it caused an internal bombardment that was all-pervasive. This phenomenon is scientifically known as the most powerful destructive medium. They have a rate of 12,000 to 18,000 miles per second. Their activity is very durable. Even if the life of the victim has ended, their activity has not stopped. They continue to be effective for at least 1,700 years! Moreover, such a small amount of radium, absorbed into the bones, can also cause the victim to emit radiation after death or before death. It is said that one of the women mentioned above first discovered her pain when she saw herself as a ghost. It turned out that once, in a dark mirror, she saw a phosphorescent reflection of herself, in other words, she saw her own ghost. It is not known how many of the above-mentioned female workers died from radium poisoning, but according to Lord Lee, eighteen were undoubtedly victims, and thirty others were about to die.</p>

<p>Gold Market Falls Again by 1.9 Yuan</p>
<p>——Unfavorable News Stiffens Exchange Rate Market——</p>
<p>——Guangdong Banks' Short Covering Provides Significant Support——</p>
<p>The gold market fell yesterday due to the continued stiffness of the exchange rate market and rumors of unfavorable news. However, thanks to the efforts of Guangdong banks to cover their short positions, the market stabilized after the initial dip. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw a slight decrease in London and remained flat in the US. The exchange rate supply was long, with London spot gold rising four and a half pence, American cotton falling twenty-four points, American wheat decreasing by .0625, and stocks rising by 1.75 yuan. Off-exchange trading showed stability. However, due to large speculators claiming that there were buyers at 0.0625 yuan higher after the market closed, public sentiment was slightly affected, preventing the market from becoming strongly bullish. Reuters reported that the Canadian government agreed to purchase 220,000 ounces of silver at a price of 48.49 Canadian dollars. Immediately after the news, there was a downward trend. Banks' appetite decreased, and the domestic market became loose, retreating into the 50 yuan range. Rumors spread that the central government would borrow 60 million yuan from the United States in hopes of lowering the exchange rate, allowing China's silver price to align with foreign prices and preventing the outflow of silver. The exchange rate market continued to be stiff and fell further, but it rebounded due to large buyers taking advantage of the lower prices. Although sellers were eager, Guangdong banks suddenly entered to cover their short positions, allowing the market to maintain its position. The situation then entered a period of fluctuation, ultimately with the selling forces being weaker. Rumors of the central government opening cash reserves emerged, tightening the domestic market slightly, and prices once again broke out of the 50 yuan range. However, banks took advantage of the high prices and continued to resist. The domestic market suddenly hardened again, and a downward trend resumed. Although large players entered the market during midday, it remained flat, with general retail investors exerting downward pressure. The market opened steadily in the afternoon, but then rose because Guangdong banks continued to buy. The Bombay market reported no movement but an increase. The market remained volatile, and the exchange rate market tightened, briefly breaking out of the 50 yuan range. However, this was fleeting as banks again resisted and arbitrageurs sold bullion, causing prices to fall. Guangdong banks still had an appetite for buying, slightly raising the market. The market closed steadily. After the market closed, although Bombay rose by one to two annas, the overall market remained stable. Throughout the day, the situation was fluctuating, and supply and demand were relatively balanced. Here is a summary of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The market opened at 951.2 yuan, slightly up by 0.4 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 1.3 yuan. The exchange rate market opened with recent selling prices of 1 shilling and 4.0625 pence for British exchange and 35.375 yuan for American exchange. Immediately after opening, prices gradually moved downward from 1.4 yuan. Hua Bi, Sassoon, and Citibank offered US dollars for October at half a yuan. Reuters reported that Canada was buying 220,000 ounces of silver. Wing Lye, Fook Yue, Ta Teh Cheng, Qing Yu, Fook On, Fook Cheong, Chun Yuen, and Wing Tung Chun and Dalian banks sold, breaking through the 50 yuan mark. The selling pressure was intense. Banks offered US dollars for October at 5625, falling further to 46.5 yuan. Bing Hing, Fook Hing, Wing Fook Cheong, Yuen Mao, Wing Ta, Teh Cheng, Yee Fung, and Wing Zhen Tai bought at the lower prices. Hua Bi and Mitsui sold US dollars for December at 0.075, rising to 9.2 yuan. At this time, the situation stabilized because it was known that HSBC's listed price had not moved. Yuen Yat, Heng Yu, and Yuen Mao Wing sold to 8 yuan, and Ta Teh Cheng, Fook Hing, Wing Fook Cheong, Ding Hong Lai entered, rising to 9.6 yuan. Ta Fat Wing, Yuen Yat, Sum Cheong Wing, Heng Yu sold to within 9 yuan, and Ta Teh Cheng, Fook Hing, Yuen Mao Wing, and Fen entered, struggling around 9 yuan, fluctuating quite steadily. Then, Citibank, Oriental, and MacKay came out with US dollars for October at 0.05625, and Teh Hong, Yuen Hing, Zheng Cheong, and retail investors all sold, falling to 8.2 yuan. Yuen Mao Wing aggressively bought, maintaining the market. After that, banks dealt with September US dollars at 0.04375, and banks closed December US dollars at 0.075. Yu Qing, Wing Fook On, etc., bought in succession, and the short positions of the retail investors were settled, rising to 50.07 yuan. However, Hua Bi and MacKay came out with December US dollars at 0.06875, and prices fell again. Yik Yu, Fook Yu, Qing Yu, Heng Yu, Ta Teh Cheng, and Yuen Chun all sold. Citibank came out with US dollars for October at 0.05625, falling further to 47.5 yuan. Although Yuen Mao Wing, Yee Fung, Wing Wing Lye, and Ta Hing Wing entered the market at 8.4 yuan, the supply side was constantly active, and retail investors exerted downward pressure, falling again to 7.2 yuan. Yu Qing Wing and Ta Fat Wing took advantage of the low prices, and the midday close was 947.7 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 8 yuan. After the market closed, Ta Teh Cheng and Yu Qing Wing goods were inexpensive and more stable.</p>
<p>The market opened in the afternoon at 948.4 yuan, and goods opened at 8.2 yuan. Hua Bi sold December US dollars at 0.08125, then at 8.5 yuan. Dalian banks and Fook On divested, retreating to 7.8 yuan. Yuen Mao Wing, Fook Yu, Yuen Qing, Cheung Tung Chun entered to above 8 yuan. Yuen Mao Wing, Yu Qing Wing, and Ta Teh Cheng bought in succession. The Bombay market reported no movement, and prices rose again to 9.4 yuan. Heng Yu sold inexpensive bullion and retreated. Later, Zheng Jin sold December US dollars at 0.075, and Heng Hing entered, rising to 50.01 yuan. Citibank came out with November US dollars at 0.0625, and Heng Yu, Sum Cheong Wing, and Dalian banks all sold, falling to 9.1 yuan. Heng Hing, Ta Teh Cheng, and Zhao Feng Cheong continued to accept bullion, and the situation remained loose. Later, with supply from Yuen Yat etc., the market closed, retreating to 948.9 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 9 yuan. After the market closed, Bombay only rose by one anna, which was extremely stable. The highest price for the day was 951.4 yuan, and the lowest was 946.5 yuan, a fluctuation of 4.9 yuan. The result was a further drop of 1.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to HSBC's listed US dollar exchange rate, remained unchanged at 35 yuan. The standard gold price was 988.57 yuan, suppressed by nearly 40 yuan based on the closing price, a suppression of slightly less than 2 yuan compared to the previous close. Registration for this month was 954 yuan, September was 949 yuan, and October was 948 yuan. The morning water rate was 954 yuan, and the afternoon water rate was 955 yuan. The price of pure gold was estimated at 963.2 yuan, an increase of approximately 12 yuan. Tianjin banks, due to swap relationships, actively bought. Over-the-counter trading of 993 transactions rose from 16.25 yuan to 17 yuan, with Ying Fung, Heng Tai, Hong Run, Ta Teh Cheng, etc., selling approximately 3,400 taels to Tianjin banks. Ying Fung Heng paid Fook Cheong a premium of 1.5 yuan for September-October swaps, totaling 210 bars. Using this premium, spot goods of 993 were sold to visiting banks. 21 bars remained for this month's bars, totaling one long position. There was one short position. 2,345 bars remained for September's bars, totaling 16 long positions and 8 short positions.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Exchange Rate Market Still Loose <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign news, London's long-term interest rates decreased by 0.0625, but the fundamentals were unfavorable and American banks remained fixed. London spot gold rose by four and a half pence, the British exchange rate against the US dollar rose by .0625, the US dollar against the British pound rose by half a point, and the British pound against the French franc fell by 12 points, while the US dollar against the French franc rose by 0.01625. The exchange rate market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling and 4.0625 pence for British exchange and 35.375 yuan for US exchange. Compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate was flat and the US exchange rate was slightly loose. Reuters reported that Canada was purchasing 220,000 ounces of silver. The market immediately stiffened after opening. Banks' appetite decreased, and with rumors of unfavorable news, the process was loose. HSBC's listed prices were revealed, with the British and US exchange rates being flat. Chinese businesses were still closing out positions, and Yuen Yat also had an appetite for buying, slightly tightening the market. After that, the gold market rose and the domestic market also tightened, but because banks were still aggressively selling, the market remained loose at midday. The afternoon market was flat, and then the Bombay market reported no movement. The gold market continued to rise, and the process gradually tightened. However, banks still had the intention to sell at high prices, and many Chinese businesses were closing out recent positions and speculating on the gold price. The situation was uncertain afterwards. The closing selling price for recent British exchange was 1 shilling and 4.06875 pence, and the US exchange was 35.4375 yuan or half a yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate was loose by 0.0625 and the US exchange rate was stiff by 0.0125. Chinese businesses' buying and selling were mixed.

<p>Recently, the silver dollar market, due to the outflow of silver dollars abroad, caused a slight panic and the overnight interest rates broke this year's record, rising by more than 10%. Economic experts stated that the export of silver had no significant impact on China's finance, so public sentiment was slightly reassured. Yesterday's market price therefore stabilized. The overnight interest rate remained at 13% in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day. The premium for overnight loans initially started at 5%, then changed to 3%, more than 6-7% lower than the previous day, indicating that public sentiment was not as tense as it had been in previous days. The transaction volume of interest-bearing notes was over 3.3 million for account transfers and new transactions in the morning market, and over 400,000 in the afternoon market. Transactions at the Small General Association amounted to over 300,000. For silver mortgage loans, repayments amounted to over 800,000, and new loans amounted to over 900,000.

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins continued to fall by one yuan due to sluggish trading, to 833 yuan, the same in the morning and afternoon.

<p>Bond Market Loiters, Sees Mixed Performance</p>
<p>—Only Closing and Swapping Transactions on the Floor—</p>
<p>Yesterday, after several days of dramatic fluctuations in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market suddenly calmed down. Market rumors had dissipated, and sellers had temporarily stopped. Trading was no longer as active as before. Only closing and swapping transactions were slightly more lively on the floor. Market prices also varied due to differing trends in supply and demand. However, this situation will likely be temporary. With only the last three days of trading left for this month, and significant outstanding positions on both sides, the market will likely experience significant changes. Yesterday's morning opening already showed signs of hesitation, with a slight initial increase followed by weakness. Due to urgent covering by short positions or heavy selling by long positions, market prices fluctuated slightly. The second session did not deviate from this situation. The afternoon opening showed a hesitant upward trend. The National Salt Tax performed better than others, up by .035 yuan or more, but the Regular Six felt lackluster. Overall, market prices ended the day with more gains than losses, with the Twenty-Third Customs current month issue seeing the largest drop of .085 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 15-16 million yuan. The high, low, and changes are listed in the comparative table below (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report from New Fung Foreign Firm, yesterday (August 22nd), the New York Stock Exchange was abuzz with rumors of government support for railway companies, prompting short positions to cover urgently. Other stocks also rose in tandem, with trading activity reaching levels not seen since August 9th. By midday, buying and selling had slowed, but prices remained stable. Tobacco stocks surged due to a 19% increase in the tobacco company's output in July compared to the same period last year. Grain prices were slightly mixed due to the weakness of Canadian wheat and profit-taking by brokers and Eastern speculators. However, high pork prices drove up shares of packaging fertilizer and agricultural equipment companies. The small exchange market also thrived, starting with oil stocks and then extending to meat packaging stocks. In the bond market, U.S. government bonds were soft, but speculative corporate bonds rose, especially railway bonds. The total trading volume for the day was 1.3 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>

<p>Yarn Falls Near 80 Yuan This Month</p>
<p>Large Bulls Unwilling to Take Delivery</p>
<p>Many Retail Investors Closing Positions</p>
<p>The yarn market started with a fall followed by a rise. With only two days left in the current trading period, there were rumors that sellers would deliver 1,000 to 2,000 bales of new yarn. Previous rumors indicated that money shops were prepared to take delivery of 10,000 bales, but there was no movement in the market. Therefore, many investors were forced to endure losses and close their positions due to pressure from sellers. The lowest price seen was 180.05 yuan. Distant months were slightly affected and had difficulty rising.</p>
<p>(Benchmark Yarn Falls Near and Rises Far) The benchmark yarn market opened with American cotton falling by more than 20 points and the current month market being extremely weak. Sellers delivered more than 1,000 bales of new yarn, and money shops were not taking delivery. Consequently, many retail long positions closed, and the market trended downward. Distant months were constrained, and the result was a fall of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 yuan across all months. The market opened in the afternoon, continuing the weak sentiment from the morning. Transactions of spot yarn stalled. Suddenly, at the third closing bell, there was a jump of .05 or .06 yuan, because a certain yarn factory was taking profits and covering shorts. As a result, all months rose by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 37,300 bales. 1,050 bales were sold by Tung Fu, 850 bales by Ming Teh, 850 bales by Cheung Yu, 650 bales by Yuan Teh, 600 bales by Cheung Fung, 600 bales by Xinhua, 1,200 bales by Yuan Yee, and 700 bales by Sin Shing. 1,050 bales were bought by New Cheong, 750 bales by Kit Fung, 450 bales by Kum Cheong, 1,000 bales by Wai Hong, 600 bales by Yee Ta, 1,000 bales by Yuan Tai, 550 bales by Cheung Fung, and 450 bales by Cheung Yu.

<p>The cotton market is trending firmer, but American cotton has fallen. The port has not been affected, because recently there has been a severe drought, with no rain for a long time. Cotton seedlings are in the process of blooming, causing significant damage. Therefore, sellers are not moving and the market floor is dry. The market appears tense. New cotton prices are not cheap. However, large speculators are not moving.</p>
<p>(Benchmark Cotton Falls Chen Cotton Rises New Cotton) The benchmark cotton market opened with the American cotton falling. The mood in the market was tight, because there was little new selling. Yuan Yee Co. had large purchases. All months rose .005 to .01 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon. Affected by the yarn market, it fell .01 yuan. The market was dry up to the second and third trading bell. The market suddenly soared. The closing price rose again. Many say that the recent weather is dry, which is unfavorable to cotton trees. All months rose by 0.005 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 78,200 piculs. 1,800 piculs were sold by Wai Hong, 1,600 piculs by Kit Fung, 1,300 piculs by Ming Teh, 1,500 piculs by Shin Cheong, 1,100 piculs by Ta Fook, 1,300 piculs by Shin Kee, 1,700 piculs by Cheung Fung, 1,600 piculs by Ta Chong, 2,600 piculs by Teh Kee, 4,000 piculs by Cheung Wo. 2,500 piculs were bought by Sum Hong, 2,800 piculs by Heng Yik, 1,400 piculs by Yuan Teh, 7,200 piculs by Yuan Yee, 4,200 piculs by New Hing, 2,600 piculs by Yik Fung, 1,600 piculs by Yuan Tai, 2,400 piculs by Cheung Fung, 2,200 piculs by Hong Cheong, 1,400 piculs by Hip Shing.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices declined due to pressure from sellers, rainfall in drought-stricken areas, and hedging by Southern traders. The spot price fell by 25 points, and futures dropped by 22 to 25 points. British cotton futures fell by 6 points. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to purchases by brokers but weakened later due to selling by speculators. As a result, Ping Gu'er, Aomula, and Bai Luoxi all fell by half a rupee.

<h3 id="e258">Grains: The Future Market for Flour Suddenly Turns Quiet <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after trading began in the morning, all contract months showed an initial weakness followed by stability. Chicago wheat prices fell slightly by about 0.02 yuan, and Canadian wheat fell by about 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Therefore, at the opening, all contract months were priced down by about 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. However, from the second session onwards, although real sales from northern routes were stagnant, outside investors still saw favorable conditions due to the continued drought. Many buyers from inland areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces continued to buy, so prices rebounded by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. By the afternoon opening, the market had turned cold, and the decrease in trading volume was the lowest seen recently. Only over 100,000 bags were traded in the afternoon, and the bleak situation was evident. The sudden quietness of the market was due to the complete inactivity of real sales, which deterred outside investors from entering, despite their positive sentiment. However, factories did not dump their stock, so prices did not fluctuate much. As for Tianjin spot flour, the warship brand was quoted at 0.66 yuan, the artillery cart brand at 0.72 yuan, and the Double Horse brand at 0.75 yuan, which was more than 0.20 yuan lower than the peak price. As a result, the contract months from the current month to October were down by 0.0075 yuan, November was down by 0.0025 yuan, December was up by 0.01 yuan, and January was up by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Wheat Futures Follow Imported Wheat Down <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after trading began in the morning, all contract months showed a consistent downward trend. Chicago and Canada both saw prices fall slightly by about 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. When the prices opened, market sentiment was depressed. The current month's contracts were affected by delivery obligations and abundant spot wheat supply, so factories showed no urgency to buy. Therefore, the opening price fell to 0.82 yuan, down 0.13 to 0.14 yuan from the previous day. This situation was purely due to the imbalance between supply and demand, so price fluctuations were uncertain. The distant months also fell, but the situation was relatively stable. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment slightly improved due to the rebound in the flour market in the morning. The current month rebounded by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, while trading volume in the distant months was very thin, with little price movement. As a result, the current month fell by 0.08 yuan, September fell by 0.03 yuan, October fell by 0.01 yuan, November fell by 0.02 yuan, December remained unchanged, and January was up by 0.01 yuan. The spot wheat market was active, but prices were suppressed by factories and failed to rise. Shandong Xuzhou Guide wheat was quoted at 4 yuan, Linhuaibengbu wheat at 4 yuan, second grade at 0.98 yuan, Qingjiang wheat at 3.95 yuan, Liuhe wheat at 3.88 yuan, second grade at 0.83 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.85 yuan, second grade at 0.80 yuan, and Gaoyou wheat at 3.89 yuan. Fuxin purchased 20,000 bags, Fufeng purchased 10,000 bags, and hoarders also sold 10,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Scarce Arrivals at the Source <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Rice Prices Rise by 0.02-0.03 Yuan</p>
<p>—Over Ten Stone of Kunshan New Tuan Jian Tou Arrive in Bulk—</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) There was slightly more supply from various sources, about 3,000 stone. After a previous price surge, prices continued to rise at the opening yesterday. Although retail sales in the local market were not yet brisk, market sentiment was unusually high. This was due to the persistent drought since early autumn, rumors of export bans in rice-producing areas of various provinces, and the drought affecting small ports in the interior, leading to scarce arrivals. The market rallied accordingly. Although there was a brief reversal, it quickly resumed its upward trend. Therefore, until the close, the prices of all thick japonica and late rice varieties rose by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Only older batches showed slight mixing. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan also followed suit and rose by about a foot. Zhoupu new japonica, with its improved rice seed, was of good quality and priced at 11.5 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, over ten merchants arrived from He Xia. Sales of various goods were active. White japonica was sold at the original price plus 0.20 yuan, while early Bo Dao, Yang Du Jian, and Bai Yuan were sold at the original price plus 0.10 yuan. The arrival of Dong Xin japonica was scarce, and sales were brisk, with prices firmly established. Over ten stone of Kunshan New Tuan Jian Tou arrived, priced at 10.02 yuan. Top-quality white japonica from Changbang was traded privately at 0.07 yuan.</p>

<p>—New Duchang Soybeans from Jiujiang Open at 4.49 Yuan—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the second batch of 27 bags of new white sesame seeds from Yangzhou arrived. The quality was as plump as the first batch, and it was also dry. However, the amount of mud and debris was still significant. The price opened at 7 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the first batch. Only local merchants inquired about it. New yellow soybeans were very popular because the local Changzhou Niupi Yellow soybeans, which were usually sold together, had a poor harvest this year. Although there was a batch on the market, it was short-lived, and no further shipments have arrived. New soybeans from Jiujiang were sold at over 1,000 bags per day. Although they faced competition from new soybeans from Hankou, each had its own use. Therefore, the price of new soybeans from Jiujiang gradually increased. Yesterday, top-quality soybeans continued to rise by 0.1 yuan, and medium-quality soybeans rose by 0.2 yuan. Over 1,000 bags of soybeans from Chengmen and over 300 bags of soybeans from Jiangqiao were sold. There were also 165 bags of Duchang soybeans from Jiujiang, which were the first to arrive. The price opened at 4.49 yuan, and the quality was still good. However, there were some hardened grains. The trend for old soybeans remained stable for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Old Coarse Rice from Zhongguan Quoted at Over 10 Yuan <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Imported Rice Storage Active...Road Goods Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for imported indica rice continued to rise. Hoarders were particularly interested in forward-dated imported rice. Foreign merchants, including Fuga and Dahu, opened new transactions for 2,000 tons, and the market saw 550 tons of recycled transactions. Prices were about 0.10 yuan higher per 100 catties compared to the previous market. Saigon rice for September delivery opened at 5.55 yuan, and for October delivery at 5.60 yuan. Recycled goods were once quoted at 5.70 yuan, but buyers became cautious in the afternoon, and the market remained flat. Yesterday, 1,500 bags of current imported rice were sold to the interior at 11.25 yuan, and medium-grade rice was sold at 11.00 to 10.85 yuan, up 0.20 yuan from the previous day. Road goods from Xiguan were sold at 11.75 yuan, also up 0.15 yuan. This rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 4th or 5th of next month.</p>
<p>Because various ports have banned the export of guest indica rice, the supply has gradually decreased, and the existing stock is dwindling. The arrival and stock of guest coarse rice are both scarce, making it particularly tight. Buyers from the interior are very interested. Xiangji Jing has already broken through 11 yuan, priced at 11.10 yuan. Taizhou machine-milled rice reached 10.09 yuan, each rising by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to the previous market. Other varieties followed suit. Because the local market for coarse rice was active and the market was short of supply, the price increase was particularly significant. Yesterday, Mingguang coarse rice opened at 10.017 yuan, and all coarse rice in the market broke through the 10 yuan mark. Coarse rice from the Yangtze River opened at 10.02 to 10.03 yuan, and new coarse rice was also quoted as high as 9 yuan. The market tension was the highest seen this year. Yesterday, there were only 300 bags of Mingguang coarse rice and 300 bags of Zhangzhou coarse rice, priced at 10.08 yuan. There were no other transactions. Statistics for machine-milled indica rice were less than 2,000 bags. However, two ships carrying coarse and machine-milled rice are expected to arrive in Shanghai today and tomorrow, but the quantity is not large. After arrival, they will be quickly sold.</p>

<p>New white lotus is currently entering the market, but the quantity is still scarce. The first batch to arrive in Shanghai was sold for 40 yuan. Now, due to tighter land prices, the Shanghai market has gradually risen by 2 yuan. Yesterday, it was sold for 42 yuan. Since "new candied dates" entered the market, prices have gradually fallen. Recently, more goods have arrived, and the trend is even weaker. Bare dates are only sold for 25 yuan, a decrease of as much as 10 yuan compared to the highest price.</p>

<p>Ninety-pound tinplate, whether from England, America, or Germany, is in short supply in the market. The standard price per box is quoted at 16.75 yuan (American goods), a sharp increase of 0.5 yuan from the previous day. English goods are out of stock, and German goods are also quoted at around 16 yuan. However, there are many buyers, and the market is exceptionally firm.</p>

<h3 id="e265">Talking About Modernity <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lang</p>
<p>"Fashionable" and "modern" are used similarly but have different meanings. "Modern" simply means contemporary, which is why we have "modern" coats, "modern" haircuts, and so on. The word "fashionable," however, comes from the "Book of the Later Han Dynasty" and inevitably carries a bit of an old-fashioned air.</p>
<p>What era are we in now? It's a time for lying in wait, biding our time, and preparing for action. We should be practical and active, gritting our teeth and working hard. There's no room for "modern" or "fashionable" things. But this is, after all, the modern era. Grandmothers and young ladies may still have minds stuck in the 18th century, but outwardly, they're "modern" from their haircuts all the way down to their sanitary belts and high-heeled shoes—nothing is not modern. Commerce may be collapsing rapidly, but modern decorations become more colorful and extravagant every day, achieving the utmost in splendor. The social and rural economies may be bankrupt, but dance halls, movie theaters, amusement parks, and so on are being built as many as possible. Besides...besides...Fortunately, all that matters now is being modern; everything else can be ignored.</p>
<p>People in our country have a certain characteristic; in our local dialect, we call it "following the crowd." You see, when a new star arrives on the stage, if they've been performing for only a week or two, I guarantee you won't be able to get a seat ten days in advance. If some scoundrels get into a fight or argument in the street, hundreds of people will gather to watch. If a lady or young miss takes a tumble in a rickshaw, it's an even more fantastic spectacle, and the crowd on both sides will cheer and applaud loudly.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, when the news of the Sichuan army's death in battle suddenly spread, fireworks shops had a field day. As for whether Bai Chuan actually died, no one bothered to ask. During the solar eclipse the other day, everyone set off firecrackers and rockets, banging on dustpans and foot gongs, making a huge ruckus. No one bothered to ask whether the Moonlight Bodhisattva was actually being eaten by the wild moon. Fortunately, as long as there's a name for something, people will naturally join in.</p>
<p>Especially with imported goods, foreign products, they're the most reliable. No matter if they're good or bad, no matter what they are, they're sure to be welcomed by the masses, and no one dares to say a word against them. If someone raises some questions or their attitude is less than enthusiastic, humph! They'll be enveloped by the same mentality as the Boxers, leaving them unable to speak. No wonder traitors like Zheng Xiaoxu simply surrendered to Japan and devoted themselves to working as traitors, becoming utterly insane and acting decisively. I think if this kind of thinking spreads, it will not only lead to the destruction of the country but also to the extinction of the race. Truly, Amitabha.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Desert Rain <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Kunikida Doppo, translated by Wakamatsu</p>
<p>A camel returned from the country of the East. The camels living in the desert welcomed it and asked about the wonders of the East. The returning camel replied:</p>
<p>"The country of the East cultivates plants and has many people living there, unlike the solitude here. And it has an incredible rain."</p>
<p>"What is rain?"</p>
<p>"Rain is water that falls from the sky. Before the rain falls, clouds appear."</p>
<p>"What are clouds?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Clouds! Clouds! They cannot be described in words, but they are called clouds."</p>
<p>The camels living together, standing and lying down, all said together: We must see these clouds, this rain. Let us pray to our gods.</p>
<p>So they waited for the moon to appear. The moon was their revered god. The moon appeared from the East, illuminating the boundless white sands, shining like a glittering sea. The old camel prayed to her.</p>
<p>"Beautiful goddess whom we revere! Please show us these things, clouds and rain."</p>
<p>Clouds then slowly emerged, and rain fell softly. For thousands of miles, the boundless desert, without wind, rained softly. What a lonely scene this was! A desolate and sad scene!</p>
<p>The rain continued to fall for three days and three nights, the sky overcast, the sun invisible, and the moon invisible.</p>
<p>At first, the camels watched as if appreciating a treasure. But now they felt fear and cried out in sorrow.</p>
<p>"God! God of light! Please take away the clouds and rain! Grant us to live forever in the country of light!"</p>
<h3 id="e267">Moritervsky <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Ying</p>
<p>There was a man with twelve fingers and twelve toes; his face was as oily as a plaster cast model; a shock of yellow-brown wavy curls. In that region, if you asked anyone, they all knew him. He was a wanderer who had even forgotten his own nationality: Moritervsky.</p>
<p>He would sing you his favorite song, of which he was very proud. If you couldn't understand it, he would sing it three times, five times, countless times! He would only stop apologetically when you were tired of listening. Sometimes, he would get so angry that he would start crying alone!</p>
<p>Who didn't know to what extent his song was moving? However, it was a fact that he could play the violin with exquisite skill.</p>
<p>He took his companion—his only violin—and ran to the east. He asked the people there, he sang a very moving song for them! But in the end, no one gave a straight answer saying they wanted to listen, or simply saying they didn't need to listen.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen! My desire is not great, I only need the price of a cup of coffee or tea – anything will do! Or just give me a cup of boiled coffee, that would be fine too."</p>
<p>But still, no one came forward to grant such a meager request.</p>
<p>Yet it was a fact that he could play a very pleasant song. He was Moritervsky, whom everyone knew!</p>
<p>Wandering to the west, someone said bluntly: "Moritervsky, we don't need to hear this famous song of yours that we can't understand! You might as well listen to your own famous song yourself."</p>
<p>There was a bit of bitterness in those words.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, just let me play a tune, and take half the cup of coffee you just drank as payment!"</p>
<p>"Then play it; actually, we still don't need to hear your song!"</p>
<p>The young man, with half-generosity, accepted this semi-obligatory condition!</p>
<p>Moritervsky began to use his twelve fingers to play a song that was said to be "Don't Wander Around in the World, Fathers, Mothers, and Sisters!"</p>
<p>Some people said, wasn't that too tragic?</p>
<p>? ? ? ?</p>
<p>After a year like this had passed, Moritervsky's name was no longer on the minds of people in general.</p>
<p>We would no longer see that plaster-cast face: that wanderer with twelve fingers and twelve toes, with a shock of yellow-brown wavy curls, Moritervsky!</p>
<p>According to several investigations, he may have wandered to another region! Perhaps it was like that song, wandering away from fathers, mothers, and sisters in the world? Even now, we cannot get any news about him!</p>

<h3 id="e269">Riverside Moonlit Night <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>"Father, if it doesn't rain again, it'll be hard to harvest anything, even with watering all day long."</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>"Well, we can only see how this time's ritual goes."</p>
<p>The moon hung high in the sky, and the sky was a clear blue with not a single cloud in sight. It was already past midnight, but the riverside was still in an uproar. Countless shirtless farmers, old and young, were working hard to tread the waterwheels. Their panting sounds, combined with the creaking of the wheels, mixed into a chaotic din, making it impossible to hear anything else.</p>
<p>Although Old Chen was in his fifties or sixties, he had no choice but to work his old bones to help his young son after his eldest son died. He hadn't slept for ten nights, but he had to endure and work.</p>
<p>"Old Chen, look at the moonlit sky, there isn't a cloud in sight. Don't expect rain tomorrow." Li Amao, on the waterwheel next to Old Chen, said sadly, pointing at the sky.</p>
<p>"The heavens are really against us. Old Li, think about it, we've lived our whole lives, have we ever seen a drought like this before?" Old Chen also shook his head dejectedly as he replied to his old friend Amao.</p>
<p>A commotion and shouting spread from the west side of the river to the east. Everyone looked over there and asked in a clamor, "What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Another person has collapsed, it's A Gui!"</p>
<p>Everyone sighed when they heard the answer and continued their work.</p>
<p>"Old Chen, look at this, what's it all for? Two people have collapsed today." Li Amao said.</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>Old Chen's heart was now so heavy with sorrow that he couldn't speak. He remembered that his eldest son had also died like this, and tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>"Old Chen, don't be sad. Everything is predestined. The ritual this time will be seven days tomorrow. The heavens will surely show mercy!"</p>
<p>"Humph, that's nonsense. Expecting it to rain with this kind of sky? I'm afraid even if we perform the ritual for forty-nine days, there still won't be any rain!" Old Chen's son interjected.</p>
<p>"What does a kid know? Didn't it rain last time after we performed the ritual?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Your father is right. Last time it rained after three days of the ritual. This time it's been seven days, and we've even abstained from meat. The heavens will surely show mercy."</p>
<p>The sound of the waterwheels continued to resonate, and the panting of the people continued to linger. But the cracks in the fields still remained.</p>
<p>The moon had slipped away, and the eastern horizon was gradually turning white. Old Chen left the riverside alone and walked home on the dry, hard-packed mud road.</p>
<p>His head was throbbing in waves, and he trudged wearily with heavy steps. All he could think about was whether the heavens would send down a few drops of rain.</p>
<p>The sun slowly rose from behind the mountains again, and the entire field was bathed in scorching light. Old Chen sat outside his house, shaking his head at the sun, a sudden pang of sorrow in his heart. Tears streamed down his face as he thought of the death of his eldest son, the overwork of his young son, and the despair of the autumn harvest. His heart pounded relentlessly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, news about Old Chen spread in all directions.</p>
<p>"Old Chen from East Village committed suicide by drinking salt brine!"</p>
<h3 id="e270">On the Way <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Qin</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, I dragged my weary, leaden feet through the desolate landscape towards my hometown. Hurriedly, yet as if afraid to move forward, I gradually approached my homeland. As I neared my homeland, my myriad thoughts intensified the torment! The green mountains, the clear waters, and all the scenery of my hometown, bit by bit, did not evoke beautiful memories; the poetically lush scenery only brought me waves of sadness, immersing me in confusion and blurriness. Oh, my wandering, exiled heart, why are you so restless!</p>
<p>The train sped like an arrow from Shantou to Chaozhou. I left the East Gate in a daze, crossed the Xiangzi Bridge, and walked on the pontoon bridge, step by step, I walked slower and slower! The old school at the foot of Mount Han, which I could already see, flashed through my mind...</p>
<p>I felt like I was all alone, crossing a vast ocean, I dared not think, I did not want to think, I could not think, but only dragged my heavy steps with sorrow and confusion.</p>
<p>A villager coming to the city told me that a bus had been burned by bandits a few days ago, and that A-Hu, who ran a store in the ancestral hall in the village, had been robbed by bandits. Many people from Baishui Lake and Dashi had fled to the city. The road was no longer safe. Having to pass through this mountain road, how dangerous! But, besides being more confused, I could only gather my weary spirits and try my best to drag my feet towards the return journey to my hometown. What else could I do? This ruthless wanderer had lost all reason at this moment:</p>
<p>"Father is breathing his last breath, waiting to see his fifth son, whom he has been separated from for so long. How can I delay my return for even a moment? ... Even if I am robbed by bandits, I can only go back..." My heart was filled with bitter emotions.</p>
<p>High mountains and vast ridges, winding paths, after turning past sharp peaks, there were more rugged and steep goat trails, one after another, endless dangerous roads. The scenery along the way was very familiar in the past: but now, although it was somewhat vaguely familiar, all these were traces that led to sadness. Hometown, family ruined, people gone! I didn't even have the heart to sigh, but only with endless despondency and pain, silently struggling forward. I was afraid of not being able to finish this difficult road today, and being trapped in a deep mountain and desolate valley, how terrible! And, worrying about encountering bandits, I peeked and peered along the way, taking a few steps and staring carefully. I clenched my teeth, suppressing the unbearable torment. Gradually, my feet became more and more sore, regretting that I hadn't taken a sedan chair just now, what was I afraid of the bandits!</p>
<p>Looking at the empty high mountains and deep valleys around me, it was desolate and frightening, not even the sound of birds. Looking, thinking, how far ahead it still was! I swallowed my tears.</p>
<p>Of the sixty-li mountain road, I had only traveled twenty li. The highest, overlapping ridges had not yet arrived, and the sky suddenly turned frighteningly dark, thunder and lightning roared, and I fell into a state of not knowing what to do. I couldn't even shout for help, I could only hurry on, but the distant high mountains and deep valleys seemed bottomless.</p>
<p>The rain fell in torrents, and my whole body was covered in rolling raindrops. My body was cold and clammy, but I had no choice but to fumble forward. The heavy rain was pouring down, water droplets were flowing all over my face, thunder and lightning were roaring, and the mountain paths were full of water. The water rushing down from the mountaintop almost knocked me down! It wasn't until the sky was almost dark that I was still climbing the mountain ridge in the heavy rain. The way home, until I had stumbled until it was dark, before I finally reached my doorstep.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Musings on a Rainy Day <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Just like this afternoon, I always lock myself into this moldy, narrow, and gloomy room. Not speaking, nor doing anything. Only letting my sluggish gaze wander aimlessly around every corner of the room, as if I could discover some ideal mystery in those places. And outside, the rain is drizzling down.</p>
<p>Day after day, it’s like this, walking from one end of the room to the other, and then walking back from the other end. Like a beast in a cage, wearied by a monotonous life. Needless to say, ambition has long been lost, and even the sinews and flesh show a pathetic slackness. On the other hand, the memories of roaring in the mountains and forests are unforgettable. The past life, even if it was boring, is still worth longing for. In those times! The heart is tormented by a more unbearable desire.</p>
<p>Why does it have to be like this?</p>
<p>And thoughts become even more entangled in the mind, like ivy winding around a green pine branch. Memories are full of noteworthy things: a leaf, a song, some flattened lilacs and mallows, the gentle glances of eyes, all intoxicating like green wine. A night of insomnia gives one a drowsy satisfaction. But such fragmented thoughts cannot piece together a complete impression.</p>
<p>Casting a tired gaze towards the table, the things left behind last night are presented to my eyes like gifts. A shallow wine bottle, a broken book, torn flowers, scattered useless tram tickets, a small plate, cigarette ashes in the plate! Isn’t life like those ashes? What a ghastly pale color!</p>
<p>The indulgence of the past few days is also quite a sight. I remember how I cursed myself in my dreams, how I shed tears after returning late at night and seeing the lights by the railway, how I wanted to tell people my secrets in the quiet night, but couldn't. So much sentiment was consumed, but so much experience was also gained. An indulgence is exchanged for a pain, a pain is exchanged for a hope. When one is so tired that only panting remains, needless to say, one is much smarter than usual.</p>
<p>But what's the use of this intelligence? Looking outside, it is still raining heavily.</p>
<p>The rain covers the houses, and even more so the fantasies of people. A distant whistle, riding on the biting wind, drifted closer. Seeing the smoke from the chimneys, I know people are quietly having dinner.</p>
<p>"Hunger!" I shouted so bleakly and helplessly, "I am hungry! Give me some food!" Like a beggar, I reached out my thin, terrifying hand to strangers, my hand trembling, and I shouted again, "I am hungry! This food is indispensable!" But no one heeded my voice, and the frantic cries only won empty silence.</p>
<p>Food is needed, I am so hungry that I am going crazy. Give me this, not white rice, not bread, those can go to hell, I want something that will make me survive and nourish me.</p>
<p>Give me this, otherwise!</p>
<p>A destruction will be thrown upon the world.</p>
<p>And outside, the rain is falling incessantly, I lowered my head filled with endless hope.</p>
<p>I thought of myself, and I cried.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Rather Die Without Freedom <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Now I venture to present a very difficult love problem, and I would like to ask you to help me find a solution. Sir, can you forgive me for being frank and give me your generous advice? In any case, I must ask you to give me a satisfactory answer in the Amateur Mailbox column.</p>
<p>I am a young man who has received secondary education and has just turned twenty. I have been working in a domestic goods factory in Shanghai West for two years. At the beginning of this spring, the factory, as usual, recruited a batch of female workers. It was at this time that I discovered that one of them was an old classmate whom I had not seen for many years. Since we were old friends reunited, we could not avoid telling each other our feelings after separation. Under my surprised questioning, she told me that a year ago she was under economic pressure and dropped out of school. This year, she could no longer bear the pressure of life and had no choice but to come to the city to sell her labor in order to maintain a temporary livelihood.</p>
<p>Because we had been in love with each other since before, we often went out together to chat and have fun in our spare time, and finally moved from friendship to love. Finally, with my parents' permission, I asked a matchmaker to contact her parents, but unexpectedly, her parents refused, otherwise the whole family's living expenses would have to be borne by me. Sir, in the present time when the high tide of the recession has spread to the whole of China, establishing a small family is already under constant economic panic. If I add this extra burden, how can a poor boy like me bear this burden? All our sweet dreams have now been completely shattered by the cruel reality! However, after this disappointment, she is almost always in tears every day, like a madwoman, and she also said to me: "Under the control of this environment, I would rather embrace a life of celibacy." This is her firm expression to me, and I certainly sympathize with her. But later she said again: "Rather die without freedom." Her tone was very negative, isn't she too pitiful? If something unexpected happens, wouldn't I be harming her?</p>
<p>Sir, can you pity this weak woman and save her? Can you still find a way to make our marriage happen?</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask you a few important points:</p>
<p>(1) Is her parents' method of coercion allowed by law?</p>
<p>(2) Can her autonomous marriage without the consent of her parents be established in law?</p>
<p>(3) At what age can a woman be free from parental authority?</p>
<p>Please enlighten me on the above three points, then we will repay you with our lives. Respectfully wish you</p>
<p>Good health, Tao Zhenxun</p>
<p>Answer: Before the remaining feudal forces in our country are completely eliminated, the problem of free love between men and women is truly</p>
