<h3 id="c25">康藏蒙疆之嚴重危機愼 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>藏兵大學東侵之説。近日忽又喧騰。劉文輝所部。有放棄德格退守甘孜之傅説。設此説而確。則西康邊防實甚嚴重。非有整個籌劃。殊不足以應當前之變也。按西藏問題。自民元以還。已非單純的關於宗族與宗敎之争端。而爲含有複雜關係之國際問題。藏中一部人。因交通便。中央鞭長莫及。復惑於民族自决之片面宣傅。致有親英　華之傾向。加以頻年以來。川軍閥同室操戈。於邊防要政毫無設施。且處處啓異族窺伺之𨻶。致藏兵屢次進犯旣無以政治手腕安輯遠入之幹才。又不能以武力鎭伏非法之變亂。漸使藏人携貳。内部離心。原屬於地方問題範圍之康藏糾紛。竟蔓延而成西部邊防之大息矣。</p>
<p>就目前情勢觀察。假使此時尙不實事求是尋解决之道者。則前途之危險。誠不如其將伊於胡底也。解决之道。首先當就西藏本身求出路。必須藏人遵服。邊防粗安而後可。現在達賴圓寂。藏中政敎。皆失主宰。尤懼强隣乘機猛進。而西藏本身猶無主持之人。故中央政府應速促卓錫中土之班禪趕速西返。主領一切。假令班禪顧慮藏人未盡悦服。藏衛紛紛未解。則中央當資以必要之財物。令彼左右不致困乏。并助以能自捍衛之實力。縱有反覆之人。其力量足以平定。然後西藏本身。方有自力之基礎。其次西藏旣已設省。尤不能不加留意。中央應嚴令劉文輝速整軍備武。對劉部在必要時須給予適當之給養與補充。并選派得力大員。入康指導。曉以立國之大計。邊防之重要。整飭師旅。一則使東侵之人。知中國並非無能。再則示劉軍以必戰之道。打破過去川閥私門之惡習。建立西陲防務之基礎。此其時也。能如是然後再與英人切實交涉。以中英間現有之友善關係。當亦能審度黨前局勢。圖公平確實之解决。</p>
<p>次於西藏糾紛者。厥爲新疆之紛擾。盛馬之争。已延長時日。似可暫告段落。惟現在馬雖敗退。疏勒問題。尙未完全解决。回漢之界限。仍未泯除。澄清之道。殆非空言所能得。蓋盛氏之为。僅足以自保。馬氏亦未必誠心内向。欲圖新省这長治久安。勢必須陳兵實邊。並延長隴海路北至迪化。南迄疏勒之線。西北之交通成。而後邊防亦可粗安。不特此也陜甘新青諸省區。民力疲敝。棄貨於地。鐵路交通。如果完成。則一般國民經濟。在西北可得天然富源之資助。在東南亦可得原料之調劑。能如是則移民之舉。自然實現。軍事運用。卽在其中也。</p>
<p>最後爲内蒙自治。就現在情實論。内蒙政治政問題。殆漸告一段落。自治指導長官派定矣。蒙人可以從事於其所希望之自治矣。未來之光明坦途。可於上下恊力合作中求之也。然而吾人有尙有不能已於言者。第一須愼防强隣之伺𨻶。與傀儡之借端煸動。此次溥儀之僭號。其中黑幕。盡人皆知。而蓄意拉攏蒙人。又爲顯著之事蹟。矧彼方早已偵騎四出。沙漠南北。遍處皆有浪人之足跡。近之則有熱邊警報頻傳。遠之則羲州至承德鐵路。已次第興修。初具形式之蒙古自治。焉有與帝國主義者對杭之實力。蓋其經濟能力。旣異常薄弱。政治組織。更欠强固。求其漸圖發展。已甚不易。而欲以當强隣之衝。斯更難矣。爲急求自救之計。當努力使蒙人了解自身之危機。苟非與國内結合一致。萬難圖存。同時政治上之設施。與經濟上之改進。尤須及時推行。不宜再有所等待也。</p>

<p>比上年增二百餘萬鎊</p>
<p>將添造新艦艇十七艘</p>
<p>新加坡目爲戰時遠東重要防綫</p>
<p>（倫敦）　下院經數小時之辯論、卒於晨間通過海軍預算案、該案之總數爲五六·五五０·０００鎊、較去年增多二·九八０·０００鎊、此項預算將用以建築巡艦四艘、小艦隊之主艦一艘、驅逐艦八艘、航空母艦一艘，及潛水艇三艘、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c28">下院辯論情形 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）　凱益斯海軍上將今日在下院辯論海軍預算案時、發言爲新加坡根據地辦護、海軍大臣孟塞爾提出此預算時、　　海空軍同時並重</p>
<p>謂在技術上·經濟上政治上·或和平上·英國不能承認萬噸主力艦、今有人對於海軍與空軍之相較的優劣、作無益之争論、實可扼腕，要知海軍與空軍、俱爲英帝國所必要、又有人指戰鬥艦爲時代落伍之物者，此亦不經之談、其實海軍决不可缺此物，海軍中人對於此事、未有意見不同者、</p>
<p>戰鬥艦海軍中堅</p>
<p>戰鬥艦必始終爲海軍之中堅、如主力艦减爲每艘萬噸、則較小之强國置有巡艦者、將獲有與一較强的國家合併而推翻相對的力量比率之權、</p>
<p>巡洋艦陸續添建</p>
<p>至於巡艦一層、英國在一九三六年底以前、爲條約所限制、祗可有巡艦卅三萬九千噸、雖許造六七·三五○噸、但英國今年將造巡艦三二·○○○噸、如目前全數造之、則一九三五年與一九三六年、將僅有可造之新艦一九·○○○噸、而不敷每年尋常工程之進行、英國在一九三六年底、當可獲有巡艦完全噸數、如條約所許、但對於年齡未滿之驅逐艦、則缺少六○·五一一噸、而對於年齡不滿之潛艇、亦缺少四千噸、惟此兩種軍艦、其所可許有之總噸數、俱不短少、</p>
<p>潛艇求確保安全</p>
<p>海軍部現對於潛艇沉没保全生命之難題、已有重要之决定、海軍部斷定及時起沉没的潛艇以救艦員一事、爲不可能、採用撈船舊法、殆無保全生命之希望、故以後各潛艇皆將裝置台維斯所發明之水底逃生器、庶艦員可依賴其自已之努力、而保全其生命　、目前潛艇人員、正在訓練使用此器、英國戈斯波地方已置一訓練池，香港與瑪爾太亦將各置一池　以資訓練云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>工當議員發言抨擊</p>
<p>（倫敦）　嗣反對派工黨議員霍爾對於海軍部將新加坡海軍根據地建築費、與陸軍及航空經費同時增加一層、激烈抨擊、謂此項工程需費浩大、一九三一年工黨政府所以未予停止者、其唯一理由、無非因合同已生效力而已、但嗣因預算負担過重、乃决定此項工程不再繼續、不料工黨政府下台之後、不及三載、麥唐納政府（卽現聯立政府）乃將建築工程全部完成乎云云、（哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>凱益爾爲政府辯護</p>
<p>霍爾提出此問後、新被舉爲國會議員之凱益爾海軍上將乃乘此機會、發其處女演詞、凱氏極力辯護政府政策、</p>
<p>新加坡地位之重要</p>
<p>謂新加坡根據地乃英帝國防線中之極重要鏈節、苟無之、則英國將不能往援澳洲或紐絲綸、且將不能作戰於東方海上矣、渠贊成政府程序、但渠尙主張添造輕巡艦一隊、因其旣屬需要、且亦扶助失業云、</p>
<p>海軍落伍急起直追</p>
<p>樞密院大臣包爾温稱、此預算案並不激動他國、但僅爲謀取英國安全之眞正償金耳、政府先曾希望在小巡艦方面、英國爲他國先導、而他國繼起行之、不意此種希望竟未實現、其他兩海軍大國已各造萬噸巡艦數艘、且裝置較倫德式艦砲位更大之砲位、此英國之所以造成新式巡艦而置有堪與他國新巡艦並駕齊驅之砲位也</p>
<p>星埠船塢必要設置</p>
<p>包氏又爲新加坡根據地經費辯護、謂新加坡船塢、在原有計劃下將無用處、政府現所爲者爲增置吸水機及發電站等、務期此船塢確屬有益云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>美日競争影響海會</p>
<p>極端保守黨前海軍大臣阿米利抨擊美國、謂英簽訂倫敦海約、係受美國壓迫、保守黨另一議員波蒙對於日美兩國所採海軍政策、表</p>
<p>示憂慮、謂「日本定將要求其海軍與美國相等、此事自必引起海軍條約修改問題」云云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>海上自由英感威脅</p>
<p>（日内瓦）「日内瓦日報」發表一文、題曰「英國之安全」其結論略謂、「美國最近大批增加海軍及空軍、日本亦仿而效之、英國自亦不肯讓人、無論負擔如何之重、亦在所不顧、英國最大憂慮、厥維美國所主張之海洋自由主義、英國屬地徧全球、海上交通爲英國國脈之所繫、無論如何必須保障之、但英國如欲保障海上安全、非與歐洲有殖民地之各國如法國荷蘭意大利等密切合作不可、此由今日卽可見之、英國外交對於軍縮問題、與歐陸各國見地、尤期與法國見是所以顯然接近者、此或其一原原因也」云云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>據曾氏談、海軍部鑒於各國飛機之進展、幾有一日千里之勢、故特創設海軍製造飛機處、藉以增加海軍之輔力、嗣因廠屋狹小、乃於民國二十年秋、撥欵擴充、擬於原有廠屋之前、添建工塲一所、至民國二十一年春、工塲地基業已完成、適一二八之戰爆發、工程遂告停頓、旋經海部草擬計劃、呈請中央撥欵擴充、當經中央通過撥付十餘萬、以作擴充之用、奈以中央財政困難、迄今分文並未領到、現經陳部長允許於海部經費之中、勉力撙節、撥付四萬元、以作海軍製造飛機處添築廠屋之用、現决就原有之地基、添築兩層之廠屋一所、上層作爲辦公室、底層則作爲工塲、新屋之進深、計有一百二十英尺、底層之工塲、分爲三間、左右兩旁爲木料、及金屬工塲、各闊一十英尺、中間爲合攏工塲、闊五十英尺、可供六架飛機同時合攏之用、至於原有之廠屋、則作存儲飛機之用、此項計劃、業於上星期六送呈海部、一俟正式批准之後、卽可開始動工、關於添購機器等一切擴充計劃、則須待經費有着、方可進行、</p>

<p>曾氏繼謂、該處添造寗海軍艦之飛機一架、機身業已合攏、翼架亦已裝就、惟尙有一部份零件、未曾運到、而馬達亦須俟機身完工後裝置、故全部工程須遲至本月底　或下月初始可竣工、該機造價約計一萬餘元、現在建築中者、尙有鋼骨驅逐機一架、與寗海機可於同時竣工、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c184">讀書方法論的討論（三） <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>十二日本欄由汪君的來信，使我們提起了讀書方法方面的討論，十三日編者作了一槪括的引論，提出了三個要點，今日我們更具體的來談談方法論。　編者</p>
<p>這確是一個很困難的問題。並且，有許多人是反對讀書要先找什麽方法的論的。譬如林語堂先生就主張漫讀，不必規律太嚴、自然林先生的高論是爲對付現在流行中國的美國式的敎學方法的流弊而發的，我們也相對贊成，不過林先生的意見、總不免還是「天才」的讀書論，一般平凡的人是不能適用的。其他的學者，大致各人者有各人的方法、譬如禪宗門徒的行脚，一個人訪問了許多名山大川後，雖然在師父前並未得着什麽，可是，自已的經歷實在不少、融匯貫通，也自悟了佛法。這雖然也是一種方法，但是不經濟的，也不能求之於一般辛勤的人們。如果按照時代説、它是甚科學的。</p>
<p>那末，所謂科學的方法論，我們可以採用的到底又是些什麽東西呢？</p>
<p>我們現在提出幾個要點來討論。</p>
<p>第一，在我們的基礎知識已獲得之後，譬如像汪君這樣的人，繼續讀書自然也還是需要的，但是，不是爲讀書而讀書的亂讀，而是以某一實踐的問題作爲中心去研究、書籍不過是些材料和可供參考的意見。這裏所關涉到的問題是首先你應握住研究的中心。以實踐需要作爲研究的出發點，不是在玩弄虚玄的理論，而是一面運用已發現的原理原則於實際，一面在實際中去充實、孕育生長、展開這些理論。理論與實踐是在這般不能分開的被結合着，統一在一個整體内。</p>
<p>譬如，一個研究貨幣或財政問題的人，固然，抽象一點的基本理論自然應該首先學習，但是，一個較高級的研究昨則不可僅在許多論貨幣或財政問題的書中去尋探爲滿足，一定要從當前擺着的問題，如目前白銀問題，作爲研究的主體，而去涉獵關於這類的書籍。這樣，你所獲得的研究的結果，不獨是很合於實用，而且也自然更近於眞理。研究的興趣，也比空讀抽象的書强多了。</p>
<p>第二，以上一項要想完全做好，還得注意一種研究上必不可忽視的「關聯」作用。卽就上例説，研究白銀問題不能僅限於鑄成銀幣的貨幣，或生產銀礦的生銀某一方面。也不能僅注意某一國的財政政策，某一國際恊定·，也不能僅就過去貨幣制度，白銀史的方面去求解决。研究今日的白銀問題，如果站在世界大衆的立塲，首先應不忽視目前的生產關係與資本制度，以及目前世界經濟的情况，對於經濟恐慌的對策，在這政策下大衆一般生活狀况等聯繫上去了解。那末，一個研究者，要讀的書就不僅限於貨幣以内，以外有要精讀的書·，或僅供瀏覽的書，或看看目錄，抄點統計數字就够了的，眞是多而又多，而他們徧徧又是那麽緊相關聯，離了這種關聯，你就會走到狹隘的，離開了眞象很遠的方面去。所以，這一項雖係跟着前項而來，郤仍是非常重要的。</p>
<p>第三，知道了研究上的關聯也還不够，你應如何去吸取這多方面的知識呢？汗牛充棟的現代出版界，卽令費你一生心力，也不見得能讀完某一問題的書籍。這樣一來，你如何去處理這一難題呢？主要的你應將這許多材料，作正確的估價，冷静的觀察各種立塲不同的言論，互相比較，將這龐複的書報，作精讀。瀏覽，抄存，剪貼，畫綫，等等分類。於是，你不怕材料過多，只須你處理得法，你才可用最經濟的時間，去接近各種學問，你不獨不會被書本迷住，這些材料反印心合手了。</p>
<p>第四，你對一種研究不要野心太大，你要知道知識的進展是有一定的進程的，讀書最要注意的是讀書的過程，要有一定的學力我們纔可能完成某一種研究。一定不能取巧，「英文百日通」，不是眞的「通」了英文，是呌你學點洋涇浜英語，學會了也只能做西崽。所以，知識的增進，某一種研究者應有一定的過程，譬如著一本貨幣史在著成前，研究原論，蒐集材料，讀書，看報，聽無綫電，聽演講，參觀古物陳列，拜訪考古家，看各地去旅行等等行爲都是過程中的一部分工作，不僅展開精低的撰作的片斷時間是這一著作的完成。這一點對於學歷較淺的人，尤應注意，你旣不應草率從事，弄出不成熟的東西遺害於人，同時也知道一點學問上的艱難，而這艱難是過程中必有的，所以也儘可不灰心做去·，在讀書的方面，艱難總是一步一步被克服的，祗要按着一定的道路，有條不紊的循序的漸進。</p>
<p>第五，你腦中應排徐你不需要的東西，譬如一幕婚姻的悲劇，舞台上就不應有「龍鳳喜餅」出現。你專心於某種研究，除開與它有關聯的關係外，不需要的東西，你應全部抛棄。柯南道爾説過，他除對於與偵探有關的知識外，别的都不把它攙在腦内。我讀伏爾摩斯偵探案最大的啓示就是某一册的叙文中的這一句，這是它的小説成功的要點，也是一切學問成功的要點。</p>
<p>以下我們再將讀書過程中各種技術的方面，一一來詳加討論。（未完）</p>

<p>（一）推進師敎及職敎計劃</p>
<p>本省年來受敎育經費支絀之影響、中等學校數量、未能盡量擴充、復奉部令减少、普通中學具設職業學校師範學校之規定、故此後本廰辦理中等敎育、自宣秉此方針、爲適合於本省之推進計劃、甲、推進師範敎育計劃本省師範敎育開辦、行將三十年、其間曾盛極一時、人才輩出、嗣後因學制屢更法令迭改、合併改組逐漸减少、二十年度師範生僅有一、八二三人、二十一年經整理後、加至二、四二零人、二十二年度、本廰按照日前師訓機關分布情形與需要狀况、作分年推進計劃、將全省七十六縣市、依舊道屬分爲四區、金華區雖無獨立設置之師校、然省立金華中學仍設有高中師範科、向來招一斑、本年度令飭增招一斑、餘如錢塘會稽兩區、均有獨立之師校、惟甌海區省立師訓機關尙付缺如、爰於平陽縣鄭樓地方、添設省立温州師範學校一所、至縣立或聯立師訓機關、亦視需要情形、酌有增設或改組、計先後核准者十處、乙、推行職業敎育計劃、本廰以年來職業敎育成效罕睹、其最重要原因、爲職業敎育與社會需要、不能適應、故學生無出路、職敎漸致僵化、茲爲積極推行職業、詳察本省需要情形、確立目標、作逐年推進職敎之依據、就本省需要之職業學校、自非盡量增設不可、惟職校重在設備與實習塲所、本省敎費支絀、欲求數量與質量、同時充實、勢所不能、茲就本年度内根據、本省以農業敎育爲最重要之原則、先設實騐農業學校一所於金華縣之塘雅地方、期以實騐的精神、造就手腦並用實際操作之農業人才、復以本省年來積極整理田賦雜税及改進會計制度、所需財務佐理人員數額亦多、遂於省立杭州高級中學商科、附設財務專修班、以應社會之需要、又以本省年來清文土地、建築公路、次第舉辦、需要具備土木工程簡單學術技能之代級人員頗爲近切、乃於省立嘉興初級中學附設高級土木職業斑、至此後應如何遵照敎育部規定之設置、中等學校百分比標凖　　經陳　長按照本省情形、對於中學敎育、　加以訓整、繼持現狀、對於師範職業敎育、擬積極擴充、添籌經費、增加校數、訂有四年之推進討劃、務使至二十六年度、能達到完成之標凖爲目的焉、</p>
<p>（二）改進中等敎育之辦法</p>
<p>查中等敎育、爲學生求學中重要過程、茲就敎師與學生兩方面之考核分述之、甲、關於敎職員者、二十二年度本省遵照部頒中學師範職業學校各規程、修正本省中等學校行政組織暫行規程、及本省中等學校校長敎員任免及待遇暫行規程、一方面將中等學校職員人數、略加限制、以範經費、一方面將中等學校敎員、資格提高、以增敎學效率、目下除訂頒審核中等學校敎員資格暫行辦法外、正在擬訂中等學校敎員進修辦法、俾使各校敎員、皆能增進學議、與時代適合、乙、關於學生者、半年來所實施考核中之最重要者、爲（一）履行中學畢業會考、（二）訂頒善導中等學校學生思想方案、（三）製發浙江全省中等以上學校學生運動技能測騐表三項、以上對於敎員學生之考核、如能持之以恒、則本省中等敎育之改進、當能收效益宏地、</p>

<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>「馬路如虎口，當中不可走」。這的確不由人不感謝告者的善意汽車，而且是無數的汽車、同在閃着它兩隻擇人而噬的鉅眼中的可怖的異光、兀像追風逐電一般的交織着。這時，你，置身在這虎口中的你，要是在疏忽或忽忙下覺到眼前一暗、心頭一慌，那麽，僅在這一瞬之間、你的本來安份着循行在你周身血管内的鮮紅的血，就會不經虎口的一嚼之下染到車輪，染到馬路，給坐車内的和開車的以及路過的當做三月裏的桃花看。</p>
<p>「馬路如虎口」一點也不説謊，也許它－汽車－的吃人的胃口，比了眞的老虎這要厲害。所以，「當中不可走」，你該將怎樣的牢記呢！牢記到離開「虎口」才止。</p>
<p>但是，就以上海而論··張開着等人吃的「虎口」，豈止「馬路」而已嗎？避了馬路的虎口，又就無再落入其他的「虎口」的可能了嗎？老實説··上海的「虎口」，除了「馬路」之外，還正更僕難數。</p>
<p>一切陶醉的塲所，一切舒暢的去處，一切的媚眼，肉腿，一切……也在在未嘗無有這麽一個「虎口」張開着等人吃。不過，馬路的虎口，是有形的，而這一切的「虎口」，比較是無形的。然而，正惟其是無形的，你就不像馬路的虎口的容易使你感到恐怖，戒懼而預行趨避，也許你不但不會感到恐怖戒懼而預行趨避，還將認爲很是需要的把你的身體，性命，外加你的父母，妻子，家產，事業，一齊自動的，誠意的送到這一切的「虎口」中去·，也正惟其無形的，你落入馬路的虎口時，尙堪見到你的鮮紅的血染到車輪，染到馬路，…落入這一切的「虎口」時，却連一滴一絲的血也不會從那「虎口」裏飛濺出來，因爲你整個的身體，都給消滅了。　　上海「虎口」，豈止「馬路」而已嗎？避了馬路的虎口，就無再落其他「虎口」的可能了嗎？然而，人們徒見馬路的「虎口」，而終不見其他的「虎口」·，警告者也祗警告了馬路的「虎口」，而不警告其他的「虎口」。</p>
<p>所以，人們的歸宿，終於逃不了「虎口」。</p>
<h3 id="c225">硯的研究（二） <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>（一）愛硯的原因在乎實用</p>
<p>硯的起源是很古的，黄帝以玉爲硯，帝鴻氏造墨海，是世所共知的。西京雜記還説天子以玉爲硯，以酒作滴，取其不冰，所以後世尙有黄玉硯黑玉硯之流傳。除天子用玉外，其他官民似可隨意取擇硯材，故又有水晶硯，鐵硯，銅硯，磁硯，竹硯等種種名目出現。到了秦漢以降，用硯者始知研究硯材，始認定各種山石爲適於實用，當時經多數人試騐而確認各山石中最爲適用者，有北京的燕　梅山名，江南的徽州歙石，蘇州靈巖㠛村石，浙江的衢州開化黑石，湖廣的歸州大沱石，沅州黑石，辰州常德間　溪石，山東的紫金石，青州紅絲石，登州　磯島石，山西的絳州角石·，陜西的臨洮府河綠石，廣東的肇慶端溪石，瓊州金星石，又有用虢州的澄泥硯，相州的古瓦硯者。（以上諸，石練水唐秉鈞之文房肆考皆説明其石性），此外以他石爲硯者尙多，不過無以上數種之著名也。唐宋之際。國内平治，文化愈進步，研究硯石愈粗細，認以上各硯材中，以肇慶的端石，徽州的歙石，虢州的澄泥，尤爲適用。自此以後，端歙澄三種，遂盛行於世。其時尙有洮河之洮綠硯，青州之紅絲硯，都視爲天下希有的名石，惟因出產不多，掘取不易，故流傳甚鮮，日人至今賓愛之而努力搜羅，但云絶不可得。</p>
<p>此端歙澄三種，至明清之世，又漸漸獨重視端，以端石較歙澄更適合於實用也，夫端石何以適合於實用，曰細膩堅潤，不傷筆，不易乾，所研之墨，較他硯細，下墨而又發墨，是也。至下墨與發墨之别，秀水計壽喬之端溪硯玩考所　　米趙諸公，皆謂發墨之妙，如漆如油，又謂下巖之石，發墨直如熬盤榻蠟，東坡則云··硯之美止於滑而發墨，至蔡君謨所論尤明晣，直謂發墨非易磨，墨在硯中，生光發艷，隨筆旋轉，滌之泮然立盡、乃石性堅潤能發起不滯於硯耳。故識者以易磨爲下墨，墨如油泛爲發墨，水坑之佳者二者始能相兼，如以易磨爲發墨則謬矣。</p>
<p>所謂適合於實用，其妙處盡在於此。今之愛硯家皆愛水巖，卽以此故，由是也可以證明我愛硯原因在乎實用的説了　　勘訛　昨硯的研究文内，「天上神仙一句，」</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>那天上是不像有陽光的。在一條不知名的街道上，有许多童子軍在三三兩兩地閒走着。距這街不遠，似乎還有一征廣塲，像公共體育塲之類。那牆兒是白白的，成羣的童子軍正在一拱形的門裏走進走出。這塲就是他們的集中處。</p>
<p>不知如何，我也在這街道上走着，彷彿是護眷回里，經過這里罷。正走時，忽然迎面過着了伊。我還記得很清清楚楚的，伊的臉兒雖較前白晳，可是已消廋了幾分了。伊似乎没有看見我。我呢，不知如何，要想招听伊，而以终於不曾招呼伊。等到我們擦肩而過，我回頭對伊一瞧，伊纔立定，喚了我一聲「先生」。接着，伊説··「請隨我來罷」。</p>
<p>走到一所屋子之前，好門兒是狹狹的，伊就進去了。不知如何，我並不隨伊進去，祗在門外站着。呀！號聲忽然嗚嗚地響了，伊卽忽忽而出。我説··「這是集合的命令，你快去罷」。</p>
<p>我目送伊去，深深地感到悵惘。我還記得很清清楚楚的，伊穿的衣服，仍舊是那件淡淡的自由布衫。</p>

<p>第二十五回</p>
<p>淚臉送人辭歸遠戍風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>其次便是今晚正好吹的是東北風，人只管迎着風走去，那便是走向東北，一點不會錯。不過脚下走的路，不一定是正向東北的，所以走不多遠，就要停住了，再考量一下子。而且一營人成四行走，拉直了，也有那麽長，前後不容易相照應。雖是各連都有白旗子撑起來，作聯絡的標幟，究竟這夜色是太黑了，看不不清楚。加之這口外的風，由山谷裏逼榨出來，那是格外的有勁，吹得人毛髮倒披，頭抬不起來。走了兩三小時，還不到二十里路，各人都鬧得筋疲力盡，祗好摸索一陣子，休息一陣子，後來好容易摸索到一叢大樹林了，比較的避風一點，就在林子脚的山坡下，宣告休息。只聽那風勢吹過樹杪，風是嗚的一聲撲來，樹枝是沙的一聲撲去，雖不及戰塲上砲火那樣兇猛，可是比戰塲上的砲火還要慘厲，大家在黑暗山坡下，架了槍坐着。這是月的下弦，約莫有三小時，夜已深了，夜色漸漸的明亮了，雖是半空裏風沙依然濃重，可是眼前的景致，却慢慢看得清楚，同時就發現了一條人行大道，在兩座山峰中間，彎曲的穿了過去，這若是戰時行軍的話，這是最容易中伏兵的所在是停留不得的，四個連長心裏，都不免揑了一把汗。實芳站起來，向四週年看，又抬起夜光手表看，又下令繼續行走。軍士對了風沙，扎挣了前進，不明白任務何在，各人料着，見得是打杖，但也不見是太平職務，祗好各人心裏，都納着一個啞謎，糊裏糊塗的行走。（三三五）</p>

<p>— 劍</p>
<p>在新市塲的西頭，一條濠也似的小河，巧妙地顯示着一點疆界的作用。河身很仄，但上面却架着一座頗寛廣的大板橋，從這裏可以到西城去，或者轉一個彎子，也可以取得上南城的捷徑，這是我每天都要來去兩趟的路、原因我是新市塲的固定游各，每天晚上如不能在那些歌唱館裏發見了我，那纔眞是奇蹟。</p>
<p>最初，靠近這河邊，是只有一兩家賣雀鳥的鋪子，和一家小酒店，在那木橋前面，撑着一點商塲的架子，到了晚上，僅僅一粒的電燈光，常常使我憂慮到坐洋車過橋時是不是會翻下河去。但不久那裏便漸漸繁榮了起來，商店是從三兩家增到十幾家了，徐去茶館麵館測字館，還有一家裝着播音機的洋貨舖子，每天也有些發沙的音樂聲音從那裏散布開來，誘集了許多不健全的女人，怪烏糟的小孩子，和貧血的粗獷的勞動者。</p>
<p>過了夜晚的某一適當時間，有許多不需要做晚間生意的店鋪，都關上了門板歇市了，僅只有一家麵館，因爲要供應那些黄包車的夜餐而繼續開着，從那裏洩漏出來的電燈光，疲弱得和一枝洋燭的光一樣。漸漸我在那麵館門首，看見幾個女人，一並排的站着，幾件賤值的彩色衣裳，錯雜地輝映着的是完全如我們在上海福州路所見到的某種人型。我並没有細細去觀察伊們，但在忽遽的一瞥間，不由得浮起了一些感想在心頭··『啊，這裏也有野妓了，上海式的野妓勢力，已公然襲入這小小的城市裏了。</p>
<p>洋車夫們是習慣地以這些野妓爲調謔的對象，當他們拖着客人上橋時，常常有意魯莽地擦過伊們身邊，或者簡直的，直線衝了過來，野妓們被迫的退後而且惡駡。有一天，深夜，我在市塲裏聽完了戲，坐車回去，意外地遭遇了一陣大雨，車夫的油衣，和車上的油逢，都激切地彈出一顆顆的雨珠子響。走過這木橋時，照例要看見的野妓，是只有一個人在那裏徘徊着了，大紅花的衣服在黑暗中可以看出來它膠成一片狼狽了，臉上的粉被打濕現出一條一條的痕來，頭髮上也閃出許多水珠子的光，這是一個頂醜的野妓，在那慣見的一行列中，常常是最倒霉的孤獨者。伊緩緩地迎着我們走來，當我的車子擦過伊身邊時，伊忽然停住了脚，倉皇地投射了一個重量的視箭過來，那是一對一點也不發亮的眼睛，裏面渟蓄着許多複雜的悲哀，我是不敢正視伊的，只攝取了最粗的一輪印象便忽忽過去了。</p>
<p>雨是斷續下了兩天兩夜，夜間從新市塲回家時，在洋車的雨逢裏，想象那凝立在雨中等候生意的狼狽的野妓，却不再看見伊了。麵館裏漏出來的燈光，還是那樣暗淡發愁，門前却空空洞洞地没有一個人影在着。</p>
<p>意外地，在第三天上，看見那野妓在另外一條街的洋貨舖子裏，買一把雨傘。那是白天，而且晴着。伊付給傘的代價是六角小洋十一個銅板。伊很富裕而且蕭閒地挾持着傘，走出了店門，正與我是平行。伊似乎喚起了什麽記憶的深刻地看了我一眼，照舊是一對一點也不發亮的眼睛，然而，悲衰却更見複雜了。</p>
<p>以後，在那河邊的市集上，不再看見那野妓、無論天晴，下雨。但常常還可以在雨中看見些别的野妓，在撑着傘兩頭兩往的走　，我便想起了伊來，這在人間實騐着各樣痛苦的街頭流浪人，伊是另外有一種運命的，伊已到了别個世界裏去了吧。</p>

<h3 id="c270">駐美德國大使的抗議 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>八日的路透電報説··紐約昨晚在某公園曾舉行大規模的假審判一次，以德總理希脱勒爲被告·，結果判决希脱勒犯有破壞文明之罪，德駐美大使向白宮提出抗議，終被却下云云。</p>
<p>看到了這假審判三字，却使我想起了許多與此相類的事情。杭州北廊法華山下，有一座東嶽廟，俗稱老東獄。春秋二節，香市之盛，比任何大展覽會還要熱閙。也舉行審判，上座東獄大帝，此外的皂隷書役，兵卒夜叉，無常鬼判，都由投墳的活人扮成。鼎鑊刀鋸，枷籠鐵楝，凡現世所有的嚴酷刑具，無一不備。據説犯不治之症，如醫虊無效的瘋狂病者之類，只敎半夜上山，去經一度朝審，病就能痊。因此無智的鄕民，每年總要去參加這種朝審，人數大約一季總在三五萬以上·，這總算也是極盛大的假審判之一。</p>
<p>其次，我還看見過一齣打鼓駡曹的崑劇。據説，原本是徐文長做的四聲猿劇本中間的一種。劇中景况，是閻羅殿上，檷正平輕裘緩帶，和閻王在道弟稱兄。忽而鬼卒牽引着一位繞腮鬍滿面，被枷帶鎖的罪囚到來。閻王和檷正平商量定了，就呌鬼卒開了枷鎖，令那罪犯脱落囚衣，重穿起红袍玉帶，裝成了戲台上的曹操的樣子。禰正也脱也了輕裘，換上件破服，重演着一齣打鼓駡曹的好戲。戲演完後，作丞相裝的曹操，被鬼卒揶揄虐打幾下，再換上囚衣，被上枷鎖，重被牽入地獄。禰處士和閻王歡飲幾杯，也就散了，閻王還弓身屈背，親送之於殿外。這總算也是文人筆下的一次假審判、是爲禰處士的幽魂吐一口氣的。至若岳墓前頭的鐵像，于忠肅公廟貌的威儀，那又是隔世平翻的判案，自然還該作别論了。一回頭來再想一想希脱勒，他是孔子所説的只恐没世没名不稱的人。所以墨索利尼的一舉一動，他都在模仿。因此英國的通信記者説··「墨索利尼是一個Statesman（政治家），他却是一個Stageman（優伶）」。猶之乎説孫叔敖是一個高士，優孟衣冠者是一個伶人。可是德國自俾斯麥，威廉二世以後，居然又出了這一個世界的人傑，致被人家模仿作假審判，在希脱勒本人，當然是心滿意足的了，德國大使眞不識趣，還要提出什麽抗議呢？</p>
<h3 id="c271">由左袵引起的話 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>在上緬甸由密支那赴曼德里的火車中，一望的搭客，是緬甸人擺夷人，不用説了。單以男子也像女人似地團着紅紅綠綠的裙子看來，就儘够在旅人的心上，唆起濃重的異國情調吧。女的呢，除了團有各色花裙之外，上身則全是雪白的紗衣，而有的衣紐，却又是載在左邊的。如此異樣的裝束，直使人記起古代楚國的人民來了。因爲據古書所載，楚國的人原是左袵的，孔老先生在贊美管仲伐楚勝利的當兒，就曾經這樣地慨嘆過··「微管仲，吾其被髮左袵矣」。如今楚國的舊地，湖南湖北想來早没有這樣裝束的踪影，但在上緬甸的我却算是尋得了，看見了。</p>
<p>倘若把這些印象，作爲一個假設的證明，而且加以種族語言的考據，則我暫時敢説古代楚國民族，並未消滅，而是逐漸南下了。不過他們並不是現今的緬甸人，（緬甸人Ｂurmese，據緬甸民族考TheTribes　of　Burma一書，是來自西藏高原的民族，與西藏人及野人山野人同爲一種人民）而是雲南的擺夷，緬甸的香人，（據英人所稱擺夷爲Chinese　Sban，香人爲BurmeseSban雲南人稱香人爲大耳朶擺夷)和暹羅的人民。他們在雲南住居的地方，係怒江及檳榔江（亦稱大盈江太平江等名）兩流域。在緬甸則是薩爾温江一帶的山間，（薩爾温江係雲南怒江的下流）和上緬甸的伊拉瓦底江兩岸。（雲南的檳榔江，卽由八募流入伊伊拉瓦底江）在暹羅呢，差不多重要的城市，却都可以説全是他們的了。至於語言大都是相同的，不過小小差異的地方也有，如頂普通的名詞，「吃飯」這兩個字，暹羅人香人呌做「景攷」，擺夷則稱爲「景好」而文字也是一樣的。按謝彬所著雲南遊記，謂擺夷係用緬文，這是錯了，只能説用的是暹羅文字，因爲他所根據的書，係雲南普思沿邊督辦柯樹勳所編的普思沿邊志略，而不如普思沿邊一帶正是接境香人所居的地方和暹羅的。</p>
<p>以上説明擺夷香人暹羅人是一個民族，至於由中國長江遷去的證明呢？這要看暹羅的歷史了。其起源一章，卽引意大利一位語言學者的學説，謂暹羅民族是在西歷記元二三世紀由支那長江流域遷去的，因其語言還與今日長江以南中國人的語根，有相似的地方。據我所知道的，福建的漳泉話，廣東潮州話，瓊崖話，如一二三四五……的數目字，就有好幾個，是與擺夷所説的是一般無二的。又擺夷呌「天亮」做「法亮」，這「亮」字的意義，便和我們一般的普通話是相同的。還有四川成都平原的方言，呌「酒糟」爲「勞糟」，而擺夷呌「吃酒」做「景勞」正又是有着相似的地方。其餘類</p>
<p>似之例還委多，茲爲篇幅所限，不再一一舉了。</p>
<p>因有語言上的證明，而又看見左袵的女衣，楚國人南下的假設，便浮在我的腦中了。此種臆説有否成立，自然還須詳細的研究，這篇文章只如題目所示，僅僅發端而已。</p>

<p>— 唐</p>
<p>（四）週年祭「歲月也眞無緒，但我還得長挨，當死尙未來，生之樂趣已棄我而去。」這是我一首哀悼詩的末段，去年父親逝世後作的，現在是整整的一年了。在這一年裏，我不懂怎樣生活着的，我只是「挨」。家是又經過了許多風浪，雖説有母親處置，但最大的責任却還是我自已承當着。每逢苦悶的時候，我常想寫些關於父親的東西，可是却終於不曾下筆。</p>
<p>家裏最大的難題是經濟。其實閙窮的事情老早就有的，不過那時候憑着父親的面子，畢竟還週轉得靈。况且父親也和母親一樣，他們那把一半希望寄托在我身上，家庭支離的情形，全都瞞得緊緊的，一點也讓我知道。表面上客人來來往往，内内外外都忙於應酬，熱閙得眞有些像興旺，我怎麽曾體會到窮困零的感想上去！我只知道他們見我時總是一副同樣的笑臉，如何會知道，在這笑臉後面，却躱藏着比黄蓮更苦的苦心！</p>
<p>我現在珍視我的童年，因爲在我童年裏有天眞和快樂。而且我知道·我的天眞和快樂是由二顆憂傷慈惠的苦心所織成的。</p>
<p>但是，生活的眞義終於把我從快樂的圈子裏拉了出來。經了幾次憂患的襲擊，父親在四年前的夏天起了病，先是四肢痙孿，神智迷糊，其後轉成輕性的癲癎，時發時愈。及到一年前的今天，一個静寂的冬天的下午，他悄悄地離開了這個世界。還不到五十的年紀，可是他不能不去了，還不到五十的年紀呵！</p>
<p>現在，現在是整整的一年了。</p>
<p>在這週年祭的今日，因爲是大年夕，據説便是哭聲也得避忌，我是連流一滳眼淚的自由都没有的。這回也不做道塲，也不做佛事，只是供幾盆水菓，幾碟菜餚，焚一爐香，悄悄地來紀念這終天的哀恨。</p>
<p>我們大家都忍着淚，忍着内心的悲苦，讓鼻子一陣一陣的酸。</p>
<p>母親把紙錠焚着。我目送着烟灰從地上飛起，又目送着二顆晶瑩的淚珠從母親的眼角裏流下來。我明白了人生的眞義。憑着二條臂膞，一顆腦袋，我準備活下去！</p>

<h3 id="c274">關於「烙印」 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>青年詩人臧克家的「烙印」。中最近值得注意的一部詩集。作者經騐着「九一八」以後的中國農村破產的情形，感到了深刻的人生的苦痛。他以現實的平常的材料，詠諸詩歌。他更歌詠着自已心内的人生苦的經騐。他的那些短詩，可説是詩代的象徴之一面相。</p>
<p>雖然在「新月」詩人的影響之下生活着，而臧克家，在詩的形態方面、却取用了小市民的自由律，這也是他的心理意識之可注意的一點。在這位青年的心裏，是有着好些自由主義的要求罷。</p>
<p>但是他雖主觀地要求自由主義，而舊的遺留却是時時地在束縛他。在他的身上，好像是，有兩個力量，不住地在互相牴觸着，在互相妨碍着，而使他不能如意地發展其任何一方面似的。我想，最後，總有一方會佔勝得罷。這要看他今後是努力於傾向到那一方面。</p>
<p>在「烙印」這部小詩集裏，始終反映着臧氏的理想主義與現實主義之不調和，詩人的個人表現要求與他的社會表現要求之不調和。這種不調和，是使他不能完成他的自由主義，不能達到他的自已解放的目標的。</p>
<p>從崩潰的農村，看到了經濟恐慌的次殖民地的都市，在那顆弱小的心里，產生了這種矛盾，也决非偶然的事罷。</p>
<p>他在内心裏玩味着自已的「人生哲學」。從他的詩作裏看，他的内生活，是相當地深刻的。他的内生活的體騐，使他造出他的堅忍主義的人生觀，把自已禁錮起來。如果要從他那些詩中尋找他的哲學的話，到處都是這種Stoicisme。從農村到了都市，他看見現代都市中的一切麻煩。汽車，電車，夜裏的電光，肉的陶醉，爵士音欒等等的東西，都市的一切罪惡，詐欺，詭騙，各種萬變千奇的黑幕，使他感到人世的行路難。不能適應這新的環境，於是他感到了··這可不是混着好玩，這是生活一萬支暗箭埋伏在你周邊，伺候你一千回小心裏一回的不檢點。</p>
<p>（「生活」）</p>
<p>他詛咒都市夜裏的「幽靈一般的人羣」（「都市的夜」）。他不能用他的理智分析社會，把握現實。他不能够把自已印象與以科學的整理，因而得到正確的認識。他觀念地去希望，由希望達到幻滅。於是，他「記來全是黑影一片」，要「從𣗥針上去認識人生」。他懷疑，他感到虚無。他最後造出他的「嚼着苦汁營生」的哲學。這種Stoicisme配了「烙印」中所有的詩作。（未完）</p>

<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>在每一個早晨，從安適的睡眠醒來，自窗紗透進來的陽光，早就舖在她們的床上和地上。好的夢境也許還殘留在她們的腦子裏，但是想到了這冗長的日子，就微微地又皺起了眉。雖然物質上的一切都是那麽好，可是想起來總是有那麽點缺欠。這缺欠，她們都知道得很清楚，是成爲無可彌補的了。這時候女僕會安嫻地推開了門，走進來，没有風雨的天就先爲她們開了窗子。一陣陣丁香或玉蘭的香氣就從窗口湧進來。她們披了衣服，走下床來，呆呆地望了窗外的好景色。</p>
<p>若是在春天，她們就能看到冒着春之氣的地面，也好像能聽到草根在土裏鑽芽的聲音，楊枊在更柔軟更長的垂埀在風中掃拂着。女僕定然温和地説·。「小姐，不要儘立在窗口吧，春風是寒的。　浴的水已經放好了。」於是她們就依戀地拖了更懶的脚步，到浴室裏去，然後，在二三十分鐘之後，她們疲乏地走出來，頭髮散亂地披在肩上。女僕這時早就爲她們又關上了窗子，隨着也就把早餐捧進來。</p>
<p>穿好了衣服以後，她們自定的工作也就起始了。她們有的時侯臨帖或是畫着工筆人物，有的時候撥弄着古琴，或是青松諦聽着青枝吹着地支簫，時日就這樣似易似不易地過去了。</p>
<p>因爲惦念着她們過於寂寥，在從前，家人也常到她們的房裏來，可是立刻就看到她們並不感到興趣，除開了母親之外也還帶出一點厭煩的樣子·，於是就相約了不再攪擾她們。見到人，她們幾乎是一句話都不説，還露了極不自然的神氣，但是她們也不説使人難堪的話，她們只皺皺眉，或是顯出莫不可奈何的樣子。</p>
<p>在這間房子之外呢，這家庭成爲浮　了的。青石的太太曾哭着閙着，因爲青石一夜没有回來。有時侯，半夜裏把睡着的人都驚動起，爲了兩歲的孩子哭得太久，做母親的人想了有什麽毛病。或是男僕和女僕有了不清楚的事，……但是這些事都不能波及到她們，就是閙着的聲音，也爲門窗所阻，成爲極微或是全然没有什麽的。</p>
<p>有時候，青松象是完全爲繪畫抓住了，她耐心地描着，任了爲着頭低得時間太久，淡黄的頰上現出兩塊病態的紅暈來，好也露了一點倉惶尋找着不同的彩筆和墨筆。間然地她有一絲的笑容露出來，她仍是静静地在她的工作上努力。正在翻看小説的青枝，定然會和也説。</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>我們中國是文物鼎盛之邦，所以素重禮讓酷好和平，這種精神一脈淵傅到現在，其功德已經不堪承敎了，再加上玄莊「西遊」，取得南華金剛帶回清净無爲之術以後，更看得世上一切，無非鏡花水月，卽色卽空，其風尙之所及，正未知毒害了多少蒼生，然而一般國粹論者却不惜力竭聲嘶奉爲炎皇聖胃的「故有文明」，乃中國國祚民運之所　。</p>
<p>這一事實的表現使我們隨時隨地都可看到··禱告「一方清静」處求「免難消災」社稷壇上的王土蒸嘗，實足攸關國家命運，民族生存。其所以成我國之蔚然壯觀者，皆因人人抱人生艱苦乃輪迴歷刦的觀點，芸芸衆生，渺渺塵寰，世間許多「時運不齊命途多乖」的事件，皆以陰冥中有天意神旨之所在使然。</p>
<p>中國現刻正是多事之秋，天災人禍，内憂外患，眞也接二連三，紛至沓來，弄得全國求生不得欲死不能。在此水火熱之中，乃拿现我們所「故有」的法寳，於「誠則靈」的熱求下來找出路。九一八之後，國難臨頭，北平方面曾請班禪大師舉行時輪金剛法會，開建大光明水陸道塲·，淞滬戰事後，於灰燼之餘，亦轟閙過一時「國難道塲」，禱祝和平的義舉。此其犖犖大者，至若許多以天下爲已任的「仁人善士」，每於憂患之餘，輒提倡寫經念懺，修蓋佛堂，幾乎是盛極一時。考其義而跡其心。自然是具有消弭國難挽回刦運的熱望，可是照弱肉强食的規律看來，是否就使我們「有求必應」，却又冥冥滅滅，大廢猜欵。</p>
<p>不觀乎上海的烽烟方媳，灤榆又以轟炸之聲傅聞·，至若内蒙自治，南疆獨立，西南人寇，福建異幟·，都表示不僅刦運未消國難未平，而且彷彿危機四伏、一孔冒火，百𥨆生焑。然而這乃是中華民族罪孽深重，在刦難逃，非禳求之�</p>
<p>不力也。</p>
<p>雖説天意如此，炎黄孫該當倒霉，但是與其坐而待斃，何不在絶望中稍稍盡點「人事」，此所以我們岅依佛門的巨公，仍欲再接再勵，以求解脱，藉「活佛」的通天法術，挽中國於危亡。届時寶殿排雲，香焑嫋繞，必有一番盛况。</p>
<p>如果燒香拜佛能驅兇避難的話，則滿清的義和團和團早已成功，等不到現在金剛法會。中國人是迷信的，常想以革襄飛劍取敵人之頭於千里之外，班禪的法術無邊，經此次的禳告，能使那些侵略者竟都回心改面。那就讓我先在此地三跪九叩，唸幾聲「南無阿彌陀佛」。</p>

<p>— 文丐</p>
<p>丐生也晚，我的朋友龍翔鳳舞，以及戀愛作家之金屋藏嬌，均未能目覩爲終身憾事。但天下烏鴉一般黑，舉一可以反三，在千里鋭的一角地中，地够熱鬧了。</p>
<p>摸屁股的隨筆，打打麻將的解放詞，鬧一次楚漢之争。這新的玩意兒，確哄動一時，比肥臀輕擺，腰肢扭舞的模特兒更賞心悦目。一波未平，一波又起，京海之戰，更是大擂大鼓，短兵相接，打得不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>這樣看了一門又一門，眞是目不暇接，要不得喊一聲「好」了。</p>
<p>老將們的把戲雖是眞功夫，但是小輩英雄豈青雌伏，抱玩玩儘管不妨，比比亦無不可之心，也幹一齣連臺好戲。「後生可畏」，敝丐不禁投筆三嘆。</p>
<p>自已的作品供人發表，好像古已有之，有許多所謂作家是這般的造起洋房來的。但旣已自願（諒不致威逼成姦）於先，何必翻悔於後。據説這般埋没的天才可以車載斗量。大槪就爲了不願埋没天才起見，做出未滿十六歲的風化案來了。内容倒底如何，自有精法學者公平審判，茲不贅。</p>
<p>這一個案子，多少比較前兩者嚴重。敞丐不是推恐天下不亂，存心搗蛋，倒底打打千里鏡也有拳頭粒屑飛開來的日子，不過認爲打麻將將等有大動干戈的勇氣，這關於賓座－文壇－前途聲譽的雙包案，未知「家」者何以告我！</p>

<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>故鄕瑣記</p>
<p>和舅舅道了上海再見，跑下樓來。在常屋中，遇見做了三個孩子的母親的大表姊。她問了我幾時回來，問我遇見×姊没有？</p>
<p>一個影子在我心頭掠過，七八年前了吧！</p>
<p>每一個新年，我被舅舅留住在他家裏，常常忘了開學的日子，舅舅的一個寄女兒也同樣地覇居着。</p>
<p>「很好的一對啊！」舅舅晚上喝了酒，取笑的説過。</p>
<p>「一對小夫妻啊！」表姊妹捉住了話柄，没遮攔的嚼着。</p>
<p>我們知道含羞，知道避面。然而－没有人瞧見的時候，相對一笑。</p>
<p>一個信封授給我，太陽没有探起頭來的一天早上。</p>
<p>那信保持着七八年的光陰，在我故鄕的書橱中，以後，永遠地。</p>
<p>「弟弟，我們反不能講話了，眞惱」</p>
<p>人！這個學期我投考上海××女生，如其錄取，我們可以在上海會面。我今天回家去了。」</p>
<p>不能對證古本，多少保留着原質。我們在上海會面了。舅舅的戲言，我們眞的愛戀了。愛繼續着·。一年，二年，三年……她初中畢業。學生變了先生。每一個星期，我們是上海的驕子。愛斷續着·。</p>
<p>另一個先生追求着她。某一次，她授給我一封信－甜蜜的情書。「什麽意思？」隨手扣了。「可以作情書大觀讀。」笑了。「那個穿西裝的？」點頭。初戀的初吻。愛斷續着·。四年。五年，六年…</p>
<p>一封信從郵局寄來·，生活太枯燥我向我校裏請了兩天假，昨夜住在大姊家裏（做了三個孩子的母親的大姊）也没有意思。今夜到東華（現在的巴黎）看情天刦，好嗎？誰先到誰先等。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>一個漏洞·。我已從學校出來。家庭不供給大學的費用，日中進寫字間，晚上進夜校讀書，一個人住在上海一角的亭子間。</p>
<p>放棄了特選的日文課，乘電車到霞飛路。時間八點半，她坐着等候我。選了影院的一角。「那個積極進攻了？」我問。搖搖頭「做太乏味！」「所以要戀愛。」輕輕地打着我手背。情天刦在黑暗中出現。</p>
<p>「那裏去？」看嘉寶撞死了出電影院，我們偎得緊緊的霞飛路走着。我向。　　「早啊。」談話，走路，笑，到了我的家。接吻在亭子間裏。二點鐘，她没有回去的意思。「表姊不會這般遲睡嗎！」「早在夢中的了。」「那你回到校裏去？」「我請兩天假，説回家去的。」臉紅紅的回答。「×娜，不能！」我捉住她兩條手膀，注視着她，半響没有説話。我終於悄然送她回校。第二天的晚上，接到她的信。她懺悔，她要求我原諒··愛繼續着…我病了，三個月三等病房的生活，回到鄕下枯廟似的家裏。病了一年。接到她二封信，去信的五十分之一。</p>
<p>回到上海來，到她校裏。她告訴我訂了婚，和那個穿西裝的。她結婚，她做了一個孩子的母親…七年，八年…「昨天回來的。没有見過。」我回答了大表姊，急忙地往外走。大表姊的嘆聲從後送來。嘉寶的汽車急駛的向大樹上撞去，碰的響着，粉碎，人和汽車。（情天刦中）一個影子在我心頭掠過，七八年前了吧！</p>

<p>— 胡塵</p>
<p>「生不能稱覇於情塲　　死亦當流芳於沙塲」－爲國争光的廣告－爲國争光的影片已有凌鶴確當的批評，　　爲是一種投機性質的影片，而這種精神也貫注進了廣告－這是没落的知識分子之無恥與罪惡！　　這完全是投好於一般糊裏糊塗而愛出風頭的青年，以這樣糊裏糊塗的東西。</p>
<p>在這廣告上看來，似乎只要－生能稱覇於情塲就不必死於沙塲，死於沙塲是爲了不能稱覇於情塲。所以－死於沙塲不是爲國争光的動機覇於情塲却是爲國争光的動機這十足的表示了可恥的知識分子之可恥的無知－－這不是完完全全的表示了有閒階級對於國家這觀念的無知？國家是什麽東西？你回答！</p>
<p>在這裏我們不要以爲是一個人的錯誤，有許許多多的我，整個的有閒階級，完全有這樣的錯誤－對於「國家」這兩個字的盲目。</p>
<p>而這個人代替這班人暴露了這種無知，因爲他是反映了這個社會意識的。「國家」兩字是一個空洞的槪念，我們要了解它的實質是什麽－我們爲什麽要爲它争光而不为爲自已争光？</p>
<p>要明白了這國家的實質是什麽，那末才談得到其餘的一切。</p>
<p>並且我們争的是「光」。是「利益」？－－假使争到光而失了自已的利益，還是不要争光。－假使争到自已的利益而失去了空洞的光，還是利益好。我們不要去争空空洞洞的光，而要實實在在的自已的利益！</p>
<p>這一個廣告我斷定它爲一個幽默的廣告。是爲諷刺有閒階級分子而作的。</p>

<p>— 陳冠華</p>
<p>編者先生·。説來眞慚愧萬分，我現年已是二十歲，不久便一個高中畢業生了！可是</p>
<p>我對於我自已的事情－家庭問題或者説是我的前途的危機－想來想去，始終没有想得一個解决的方案。</p>
<p>現在，我决意將我的家境和問題，詳細告訴於　先生之前··</p>
<p>（一）經濟來源－我的祖父本來是個很窮苦的敎私塾先生·，幸而我的父親有些聰明才幹，於二十年前爲敎學，爲政客（不大像）的亂做了一塲，得到些錢，財（不多），我始能自幼卽入學讀書。他目下職業已不同前了，他在鄕間旣是紳士，又雇有工人耕田，而且在外面小市鎭中，還開有兩爿小商店。商店本來在早年一共是有三個，爲因年來農村破產，商業凋零的關係，在城中的較大的一個，已於去年年關中倒閉了！</p>
<p>（二）家庭狀况－我一家十多口（包扣我一個已逝世叔父的兩個遺子及幾個工人婢女）的生活，都靠上述的職業供給，而上述的職業，又必需靠我父親一人維持。我一共有六兄弟三姊妹，我的母親除生我兩個姊姊（已嫁）外，男的祗有我一人·，其餘五個弟弟和一個妹妹（都未婚嫁，現四個弟弟和妹妹都讀書），都是我的庶母所生。我由父母之命，親戚都慫恿，已經於我十七歲畢業初中那一年結了婚，而且生有子女了！我家自從民國以來，直到前年止，我的母親雖有時會和庶母争鬧一塲，但她們姑終顧着面子關係，從未有多大的激烈事件發生，可説「相安無事」。</p>
<p>（三）問題的發生－大約是在去年三四月間吧，我的父親因爲看上了自已家中的一個婢女，於是就將她收爲第三房，此後，她的母親就常到我家來吵鬧，如果她的母親祗是要些錢用的話，我父親因爲愛了她的女兒的關係，是能給她的·，但是她要和我母親訂什麽－要我和弟妹等稱呼她的女兒爲媽媽等－不倫不類的條件，呌我的母親和庶母等如何肯服她呢？於是乎鬧，鬧得一塌糊塗。在這種情形之下，要是我父親能處理得當，問題仍不致擴大·，可是我的父親旣迷戀於婢女，同時又没有處理她的母親的辦法·，一切的紛争，都歸咎於我的老母。因此，我的老母遂萌了厭世之念。</p>
<p>（四）解决無望－我知道我父親的行爲，雖然在俗例上説「包婢爲妾」是講得過去，但在法津上，他實犯了第？條文，姦淫少女之罪。所以我爲使我父親改過起見，也就是爲我的家庭聲譽及我的學業前途等起見，曾經書函説過許多利害勸告我的父親·，并且，又寫信勸告我的母親及呌我的妻勸告我的母親不理她們一切是非，任由父親擺佈。可是我的父親旣不受我的忠告，仍是昏懵着，　頇着·，而我的妻又愚，不識從中調解·，母親更氣不過，常常和婢母及我的父親争鬧着。</p>
<p>（五）將來的危機－先生，你想這現象是何等危險！本來以我個人的怪見解，臭銅是可惡的東西·，父業的餘蔭尤其是不值得留纞的·，其次，像我父親這樣的行爲－多妻，縱淫，無論是爲風俗着想，爲社會着想，都應該剷除的。可是他造福於社會的亦不少-我一家十多口的生活都賴他供給，我兄弟的學業都頼他維持。假如他被人告發其罪惡（庸愚的婢女，雖然現在尙服於我父親的淫威之下，不有若何表示。但她母親的狼貪，將來的她，不無變動），將她入獄或破產的話，我一家生命，豈不因而斷送先生，你可憐我的弟妹幼，母親老，我的能力尙未够負担許大的責任呵！</p>
<p>（六）幾個問題－我現在要請　先生設幾個辦法·，怎樣就可使婢的母親，自後不到我家來和我的母親争鬧（須知我父親的小小物質，是不能塡住她的無窮懲海呵！）？她若到我家來要錢皮物件時，我的母親及我兄弟妻子等，應取如何態度？如何防上或避免婢母不告發我父親的罪惡？如何可使我父親的罪惡减輕？我父親的罪－假令她告他爲姦淫少女（我不大清楚婢女的年齡爲十八抑十七）或其他的罪－最高及最低應處徒刑幾年？及有爲破產的可能？我父親如果入了獄或破了產，我應該怎麽樣及有什麽法子以維持我一家十多口的生活？</p>
<p>我希望先生無論工作怎麽繁忙，都抽些家來代我想個辦法！并且希望先生要站在我這個地位和環境着想！我現在祈待着先生尅日在　貴報的業餘信箱或直接答覆，我除我心上感謝外，并祝你撰安！　你的信徒陳冠華上</p>

<p>— 義大利Ｍ賽拉歐著景心譯</p>
<p>蘇菲亞的聲音是莊嚴的，響亮的。羅勃特聽着很觀喜，像是他第一次才聽到似的。他彷佛覺得自已是和一個直到如今没有見過面婦人對着面。她的每一句話每一種表情都是表現着自已的特色。蘇菲亞失掉了她的冰冷的容貎，她甚至對他望着，微笑着，而且和他談話像對一個友人似的了。在這之前他們之間是怎樣的？現在又是怎樣了呢？</p>
<p>「當我喜觀一本書的時候，」羅勃特繼續着説，「我總是非常地想知道那個作者，想知道他（或她）是否是善良的，是否是痛苦過，是否是痛苦過，是否也曾愛過－」「也許你會感到幻滅的。作家們總是描繪着旁人們的愛情，而不寫他們自已。」</p>
<p>「大槪是因爲有所顧慮。」「我想是因爲嫉妬。在許多塲合，愛情是藏在靈魂裏的唯一的寶藏。」但是當蘇菲亞講着這些話的時候，她的聲音並没有改變。她的面孔上露着一層那麽坦白的表情，她的聲調是那麽單純，那麽純潔，那麽眞誠，使得羅勃特聽着她這樣坦然地談論愛情都没感到驚異。現在什麽事情都不使他驚異了，一切都像是自然的，在預料之中。就連今晚孤獨地伴着這位奇怪的女兒都像是命中注定的，而且是期待了許久的了。當他們分别的時候，他們彼此面對面地凝視着，像是希望確定他們的重新的認識。蘇菲亞伸出她的手，羅勃特接過來，曲身在上面·，一張帳幕沈重地落在他的身後。他們分别了。</p>
<p>當蘇菲亞的容顏和談吐的魅力消失之後，羅勃特感到混亂，他的頭腦打轉起來。他們是旣觀喜而又憂鬰，要想死，而又滿懷的生命力。他不知道怎樣想露露，想他自已，想他的未來。</p>
<p>蘇菲亞是非常地歡喜，非常地歡喜。因爲這種理由，她哭泣了，痛心地哽咽　她的頭埋在　頭裏。</p>
<p>三個月過去了，露露的結婚仍在延期。那不明這延期的原委的母親，時常將她的女兒呌到一傍問她理由。</p>

<p>— 吉羊</p>
<p>美國，自從民主黨登台，掌握了美利堅合衆國的政權之後，便瘋狂似的厲行藍鷹運動－－卽美國復興運動。</p>
<p>羅斯福救濟農工業，提出了「農業法案」及「非常時計劃」，他夢想着把美國在總崩潰的汜濫中救出來。因此，他對於美國的五大工業之一的電影業，同時也規定了「復興計劃」。因爲，美國的電影企業，從一九三二年起至一九三三年，是度着歷史上向來未有的「不景氣年」。那收支不敷的數額達到三千萬金元之鉅的「派拉蒙影片公司」，到今年的一月間，是幾乎陷入破產的狀態之下。其餘如華納兄弟公司，福斯公司……等等，皆遭遇到空前的經濟恐慌。到今年春季，羅斯福的膨脹政策着實地實施起來，和一般的企業界同樣，電影界也得到十月小陽春似的一些兒欣欣向榮的氣象，然而寶際上能否挽回電影業的恐慌，今日尙不能斷言。所見到的，祗是絞盡腦汁的威爾，嚇斯的新統制案。</p>
<p>威爾嚇斯是美國電影界的威權者。他最近對Ｍ.Ｐ.Ｐ.Ｄ.Ａ．（卽Ｍotionpicture　Producers　and　Distributors　of　America的略寫，該團體是美國電影企界的代表機關，會長便是威爾，赫斯氏。）提出了五條勸告書。</p>
<p>一，電影院歸還舊院主。在去年一年間倒閉了二千家電影院。觀衆减少是不知底止的，開映的合理底統制是非實行不可。</p>
<p>二，發行的地域底合同，這計劃若實現起來，每年可以節省六百萬金元的無謂化費。各地方爲着要統一發生事務，非設立影片貯藏庫不可。</p>
<p>三，製作費的節省。這無論何時都是必要實行的，尤其是在這時候，非把它當爲合理化運動的根本而徹底實施起來不可。演員的减薪，這種局部底彌縫政策不中用。　　四，整理制片工程上必要的特許權。自有聲片的收音以至一般技術，原作等，由組織的合理化以資製作費的節約。</p>
<p>五，電影净化運動。好像國際恊調外交是帝國主義的假面具一樣，須得在各製片者間締結着表面上的紳士恊約，因而達到大資本獨占的統制。</p>
<p>威爾，嚇斯，絞盡了腦汁，贊那破產了又破產的美國電影企業想出了這種統制法，他對於美國的電影企業是注了救命針，他對羅斯福的電影復興運動是做了「唯一的忠臣」。但是，這個電影合理化法案，能够得到某種程度的效果嗎？</p>
<p>不待説，美國電影企業的不景氣，也不是那麽簡單，可以由這個統制就能够挽回美國電影企業的厄運的。因爲他是大企業之一，當然是要鋭敏地反映着資本主義經濟的一般底動向，而且同時也不能不受着世界金融市塲時時刻刻在變化的影響。</p>
<p>所以，羅斯福的電影復興運動，能不能够復興美國的電影企業界，恐怕連羅斯福自已，現在也没有把握哩！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c284">評「桃源仙島」 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Isle　Of　Paradise－金城－</p>
<p>關於風土人情的記錄影片，在科學上無欵的有着絶大的價值。但是這裏必須詳細説明，記錄影片决不是純客觀的將某一地方的事物無條件的搬上銀幕，反之，必然要通過作者之主觀的見解，有經過作者，自已的思維而選擇的攝製，所以記錄影片，仍是代表作者之思想的而隷屬於他自已的階級，成爲有利於本階級的東西。很顯然的，「桃源仙島」的作者，將那小島的人民盡量的採取他們的生活，樸質的人情，這就是説，那地方是人間仙境，而荷屬的工人們，都是安居樂業，無憂無慮。而且，荷蘭當局，對於該地的農業或漁業，都曾經試行以機器改善，但土人不依，同時對於迷信等，荷國政府亦莫不極力改善，這些，都企圖説明荷國政府是非常優待土人的，祇是所謂野蠻的工人太頑固罷了。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們還不够證明作者之用心嗎？荷屬的小島，已是「桃源仙島」了，請讓帝國主義來統治世界罷，因爲我們得以安居樂業。雖然我没有到過南洋，但是我相信在帝國主義之統治下的人們，决不是那般純良的吧。</p>
<p>電影成爲反抗的武器，但同時也是統治的工具。記錄影片，當然也不會例外。</p>
<p>還有一個問題，也值得在這裏提出，那便是記錄影片是否也需要故事的穿插？</p>
<p>當我在金城大戲院走出來的時候，我聽得不少人説··「嘸啥道理」。這决不是偶然的，卽在開映的當時，亦有不少人退席。這就是他們受不了那樣沉悶的空氣，他們看不慣没有故事的電影，因爲在人們的習慣中，是爲了看那離奇曲折之故事而來的。</p>
<p>當然，這是觀衆的文化水凖問題，他們多不願將影戲院當作課堂。我們不曾忘懷「春蠶」開映時所得着敎訓。那末爲了補救這過渡時代的缺憾，我以爲在記錄電影中，仍有結構一個簡單故事的必要，這是説，我們必須在畫面上增加觀衆的興趣。</p>
<p>不過，我們在原則上是反對記錄影片也加上故事的，因爲那將失了介紹和記錄的眞價。但是在不妨害風土人情之記載的條件之下，我們又何妨將一切我們所應當記錄的事物，在故事中穿插起來呢？「愛斯基摩」便給了我們極好的例證。－以上，希望能引起讀者諸君之注意。</p>
<p>再説到本片上來，那末我以爲攝影的技巧和取景的方法，以及畫面的Montage都是很可取的。假使你們爲知道南洋之風土人情的一班，這無欸的是頗有價值的影片。</p>
<h3 id="c285">三個問題嚇壞了小范朋克 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 覆</p>
<p>不久之前，小范朋克自倫敦回到好萊塢，預備拍製一張「成功史」（SuccessStory）。他是坐了飛機到的。在飛機塲上，有許多新聞記者等候着他··等他脚一到地，就被諸位新聞記者圍住了。大家都要知道，美國的新聞記者，是喜歡單刀直入，毫不客氣的。於是有一位記者就開始問道··「聽説你父親快娶愛喜勳爵夫人了，你喜歡不喜歡？」小范一時瞠目不知所對。過後他告訴他的朋友，説他當時恨不得在那新聞記者鼻子上，揎一拳頭，但是那是位女記者，不便過於魯莽。所以他祗可以摸着自已的腮假裝沉思道··「愛喜勳爵夫人，……讓我想想看……這個名字很熟，但是我記不清楚了。」（大槪讀者還記得，這位愛喜夫人，就是老范朋克的戀人。她丈夫已經在法庭理提出離婚的訴訟，並且指老范誘姦其妻。這叚新聞，不久以前，中外各報俱已登載過。）</p>
<p>不意一個手溜彈剛避過，第二開花砲又來了。第二個問題是··「你情願讓瓊克勞馥和法蘭却東（Francbot　Lone）結婚嗎？」這簡捷太豈有此理了。於是他不等第三砲響，就㧞腿逃走了。第三個問題，據説是··「你什麽時候和哥德」羅勞倫絲（Gertrude　Lawrene）結婚。哥德羅是倫敦的一個女伶。年齡已經三十五歲，而小范不過二十六歲。據説他們戀愛甚深，不以年齡高下爲嫌。但自倫敦得到的消息，哥德羅對於此事，尙自辦並無其事。不過以年齡一節而論，妻大於夫，亦不算什麽奇怪。好萊塢明星中，妻大於夫的，還有史璜蓀比法蓮爾大，克拉克蓋勃爾的夫人，亦比他自已大，不足爲奇也。</p>
<h3 id="c286">凱塞琳海嬪的丈夫 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 福倫</p>
<p>不久以前，本刊上曾登載過一叚文字，説美國喜賓凱賽琳海嬪，效法了那位瑞典嘉寶的怪癖，對於自已的一切，故意閃爍其詞。使人猜疑莫决。人家説她嫁過人，並且還有兩個小孩子，她説··「可不是嗎，我有兩個小孩子，一個白得像雪，還有一個黑得像漆！」她説完了，就大笑不止。諸如此類的話，你還是相信她好呢？還是不相信她好呢？現在她的已經嫁過人，可是已經證實了。那位凱塞琳的丈夫，名字呌魯特羅史密斯（Ludlow　Smitb）,係紐的一個保險公司的掮客。他們結婚已經三年了。大槪從此之後，凱塞琳對於這件事，不至於再不承認了吧！</p>
<h3 id="c287">天一告訴你知道 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>

<p>藝華影業公司，胡鋭導演，彭飛胡萍主演的「烈熖」，開拍迄今，已有數月，犧牲了不少金錢，心血。方才於上月告成。片中大力士彭飛在火窟中表演，非常驚心動魄，而胡萍仰臥在熊熊烈火之中，看了也呌人爲之魂飛九宵，現在「烈熖」已經南京電檢會，檢查完全通過，一俟有聲配音竣事之後，便將在上海最高戲院公映。</p>

<h3 id="c289">華山艷史（三） <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 心純</p>
<p>這以後不久，革命軍迅速地佔領了上海。京華大學旅滬同學會由洪家辰他們的發起，爲他們的舊同學，轉戰湘鄂，勞苦功高的革命同志陳北峯開了一個歡迎大會。</p>
<p>在歡迎會中，北峯會到了舊雨，也會到了情塲上使自已慘敗了的家辰和余蘭。大家熱烈歡迎他。他俯視着那鮮紅的一朶襟花，驀然又想起黄振聲戰死時的胸前的鮮血，使他憮然。</p>
<p>家辰和余蘭慇懃的招呼着北峯，却又使北峯感到了一點悲痛。余蘭凝視着他，高興地説··「北峯，三年不見，你已是一位革英雄了！」</p>
<p>「你是一位現代的漂亮太太了！」北峯回答了這麽一句。家辰在旁邊説··「唉！時間都把我們改變了。」</p>
<p>眞的，時間是把他們改變了！北峯變了一個風塵滿面，帶着濃厚憂鬰的軍人，而家辰却已經是一個青年紳士，余蘭是一個妖媚風流的摩登少婦了。</p>
<p>酒綠燈紅，同學們的笑語喧閙，總勾不起北峯的興致。等到酒闌席散，有人看出了北峯的憂鬰·，站起來對大家提議·。「我們應該儘量利用這個難得的機會，來些游藝，……」這提議經大家贊同了，他又回頭指着北峯説·。「同學們，總不會忘記北峯的音樂吧，現在提議··請北峯兄在這兒彈奏一曲！」</p>
<p>北峯推辭着，一眼看見正在拍手的余蘭，他沉思了一下，仿佛一種什麽驅使着他似的，立刻答應了。</p>
<p>舊調重彈，北峯的臉上堆着十分凄凉的顏色·，這顏接着感染到余蘭臉上，她低下頭，也爲這琴聲惆悵起來。家辰也在旁邊沉思着。</p>
<p>在爆竹似的拍手聲中，北峯彈畢了，站起來向衆人答禮的時候，他也不勝傷感，眼淚幾乎奪眶而出了。</p>
<p>爲着人事滄桑的感慨，又爲着意外的環境的打擊，北峯又消極了。</p>
<p>一個寂莫的清晨，余蘭正在梳洗的時候，女僕送進了一封北峯的來信。她看了信，臉上突然變了可怕的灰色，忽忽地坐落着汽車趕到北峯躭擱着的旅館裏，茶房告訴她··「陳先生已經一早回司令部去了。」再跑到司令部，副官又這樣對她説··「陳隊長已經搭早車去了，聽説是到華山去的。」　（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram, Official News: Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengsui Arrived in Linhe on the 12th, Summoned Brigade and Regiment Commanders That Evening to Personally Impart Instructions. At the Same Time, Received Telegram from Fu Zhan Kui and Li Ming, Stating that Negotiations with Sun Were Satisfactory. Sun Indicated His Determination to Leave the Army Immediately, and Will Come East Together Soon. Wang and Zhao Telegraphed Jointly to Fu and Li on the 13th, Relaying Advice to Sun to Make a Decisive Decision and Leave the Army as Soon as Possible. Meanwhile, Military Arrangements Are Still Being Actively Deployed to Exert Pressure. Whether the Ningxia Affair Can Be Resolved Peacefully Has Reached a Final Critical Point. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Authorities Believe Sun Lacks Sincerity, Resolved to Order the Jin-Sui Army to Continue Westward. Currently, Jin-Sui Army Cavalry Has Already Had Minor Contact with Sun's Troops Near Dengkou. If the Meeting Between Fu and Sun Does Not Produce Results in a Short Period, the Jin-Sui and Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Troops Will Launch a General Offensive. Lu Fengnian's Division Stationed in Dengkou Only Has Two Brigades, While the Other Two Brigades Are Under Sun's Personal Command. Because Lu Has Connections with the Jin Side, He Previously Sent Yu Mujun to Beiping to Request Authorities to Incorporate His Troops. Authorities Believe That Although Lu's Troops Have Four Brigades, Lu Actually Only Controls Two Brigades. They Plan to Reduce the Size of the Troops and Order Yu Mujun to Return to Dengkou Immediately to Negotiate with Lu. If Lu Sincerely Surrenders, They Will Reorganize and Transfer the Troops to Fu's Command. Sun Discovered Lu's Troops Were Preparing to Surrender, and Has Ordered the Troops to Move Towards Ningxia, and Has Also Transferred Parts of Liu Yueting and Ding Futing's Troops to Take Over Dengkou's Defense and Prevent the Jin-Sui Army's Advance. Authorities Have Not Received Reports from the Ningxia Pingluo Area for Several Days, and the Situation is Unclear. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi Telegraphed to Beiping, Stating that Zhao Chengsui Reported on the 10th, Based on a Report from Regiment Commander Li, That His Troops Crossed the River from Balagai on the 5th and Occupied Ke Ke Mutou, Searching and Advancing in the Southwest Dengkou Direction. On the Morning of the 7th, They Encountered More Than Three Hundred Enemy Cavalry and Infantry, Driving Seventy or Eighty Camels, Fully Loaded with Guns, Ammunition, and Other Supplies, Resting on the Bank of the River Seventy Miles Southwest of Ke Ke Mutou. His Troops Immediately Led a Sudden Attack. The Enemy Hastily Fought Back While Driving the Camels Westward. He Ordered Detachment Commander Zhang to Lead the Second Detachment to Attack the Enemy's Camels and Block the Enemy's Escape. After a Fierce Battle, the Enemy Fled to Dengkou. In This Battle, Over Forty Camels Were Seized, Thirty or Forty Enemies Were Killed, Eighteen Were Captured, Thirteen Horses Were Captured, Fifty-Seven Guns Were Captured, and Countless Ammunition Was Captured. Seven Officers and Soldiers in His Regiment Were Injured, and He Has Ordered the Troops to Continue Advancing and Searching in the Dengkou Shizuizi Area. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Mujun Left Beiping Today to Visit Fu, Requesting Incorporation of Lu's Troops. Yu Said Lu Sent Yu to Request the Beiping Authorities to Transfer Lu's Division to the Jin-Sui Army for Reorganization. He Indicated Approval. Yu Contacted Fu, and If He Was Willing to Accept Jin, He Could Contact Wang Jingguo. The Rumor That They Would Be Organized Into a Class C Division Is Incorrect. Yu Is Going to Baotou Today to Visit Fu, Requesting Surrender. If Fu Approves, He Will Go to Dengkou to Report to Lu. By Then, Those in Lu's Troops Who Can Break Free From Sun's Shackles Will All Go to Suiyuan West to Be Reorganized by Fu. The Jin-Sui Army Can Then Advance Westward Without Obstruction. Currently, Sun Is Transferring Wang Ying's Troops to Resist the Jin Army, Which Is to Prevent Lu's Troops From Surrendering to the Jin-Sui Army. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Telegram From Suiyuan That The Jin-Sui Army Gave A General Attack Order Has Not Been Heard Here. The Majority Of The Jin-Sui Allied Forces Are Currently Near Sanshenggong. An Airfield Is Being Constructed West Of Linhe. Various Armies Are Collecting Grain And Provisions. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Jin-Sui Army's Western Advance Troops' Provisions and Supplies All Need to Be Transported West From Suiyuan and Baotou. According to Estimates, Supplying the Western Advance Troops From Suiyuan To Baotou Each Day Requires One Hundred Cars. The Military Branch Has Allocated Twenty Cars, And Thirty Have Been Hired In Taiyuan. There Is Still A Shortfall Of Fifty Cars. Hiring Is Underway In Jinbei And Suidong. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Deng Baoshan Flew From Shaanxi To Lanzhou, Actively Preparing For The Military Suppression Of Sun's Army. On The Ninth, He Went To Jingyuan and Haiyuan Areas To Inspect Defenses. The Gansu-Ningxia Border Area Currently Has Ru Dachang's Division and Yang Qutong's Troops Stationed There, With Strong Military Strength. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Divided His Troops Into Two Routes, Fiercely Attacking The Northeast Of Ningxia Provincial City, And Set A Deadline For Occupation. They Are Currently Still Confronting The Ningxia Provincial Army. The Suiyuan Army and Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Troops Have All Advanced Successively. Heavy Troops Are Also Stationed In Places Such As Jinjiazai and Dazigou In The Northern Suburbs Of Ningxia. Sun's Troops Have Not Succeeded Yet. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Baotou: According To A Telegram From Ningxia, Sun's Subordinate Yu Shiming's Cavalry Corps Has Indicated A Willingness To Surrender To Ma's Troops. People Have Been Sent To Negotiate. Sun's Troops Show Signs Of Disintegration. (13th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Baotou: Fu Gu Kui Met Sun At Shizuizi, With No Results. He Returned To Beiping Immediately. (13th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lu Fengnian And Sun Were Close Friends. When Sun Occupied The Area Near Ningyuan, He Sent Someone To Beiping To Campaign, Indicating That If Sun Faced Difficulties, He Planned To Transfer All The Troops Under Lu's Command For A Considerable Period Of Time. Authorities Have Strictly Refuted This. Lu's Request For His Division To Be Reorganized Under The Jin Dynasty Was Even More Inappropriate. If Sun Could Stand On A National Basis And Thoroughly Realize The Truth, After Military Power Is Handed Over, The Issue Of Troop Reorganization And Affiliation Should Be Subject To The Central Government's Orders And Command. It Could Not Be Immediately Returned To The Command Of A Certain Party. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou Telegram: The Majority Of The Hui Army Is Advancing North Along The Great Wall, And Has Deployed In The Helan Mountain Area To Prevent Sun's Troops From Collapsing Into The Liang Prefecture.

Ma Hongkui's Troops Received Assistance From Ma Bufang And Ma Buqing's Troops. They Launched An Attack On The Morning Of The Eleventh. Yanghou's Petty Bandit Troops Collapsed And Scattered. There Are No Bandit Traces Within Thirty Miles Of Ningyuan. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baotou Telegram On The Seventh: Wuyuan And Linhe Are Lacking Grain And Fodder. The Current Number Of Motor Vehicles In The Jin-Sui Army Is Insufficient. In Addition To Jin Continuing To Recruit Thirty Motor Vehicles, Efforts Are Also Underway In Jinbei And Suidong To Hire Camels And Mules To Transport Supplies. The Vanguard Of The Jin-Sui Army Is Still At Sanshenggong. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday's Telegram From Guihua: Regarding The Saying That A General Offensive Has Been Launched Against Sun's Army, Official Sources Have Not Yet Received A Formal Report This Morning.

Lu Fengnian's Representative Yu Mujun Is In Beiping Negotiating Surrender Issues, And A Plan Has Been Decided. Yu Will Travel To Baotou On The Thirteenth To Visit Fu Zuoyi, Discussing Plans Face-To-Face, And Immediately Return To The Front To Report To Lu.

<p>(Nanjing) The British Side Has Expressed Its Agreement To The Ministry Of Communications' Plan For Connecting The Sino-British Aviation Lines.

It Must Be Delivered Via Dalian Or By Sea. Each Letter Takes More Than Forty Days, And Transportation Is Quite Delayed. (2) The Northwest Aviation Line Operated By The Eurasian Airlines Was Originally From Shanghai To Tacheng In The Northwest, And Then Connected To The Soviet Aviation Line To Transfer The German-Russian Aviation Line To Reach The German Capital. Recently, Xinjiang Has Been In Constant Chaos. The Lanzhou-Dihua Aviation Line Is Difficult To Operate, And The Opening Date Of The Dihua-Tacheng Aviation Line Is Difficult To Determine.

<h3 id="e25">Be Cautious About the Serious Crisis in Kang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The rumor of Tibetan soldiers invading eastern territories has recently resurfaced with great clamor. It is said that Liu Wenhui's troops have abandoned Dege and retreated to Ganzi. If this is true, then the border defense of Xikang is indeed very serious. Without a comprehensive plan, it will be difficult to respond to the current changes. The Tibetan issue, since the founding of the Republic of China, has no longer been a simple dispute about clans and religions, but an international issue containing complex relationships. Some people in Tibet, due to convenient transportation and the remoteness of the central government, were also confused by one-sided propaganda of national self-determination, leading to pro-British and anti-Chinese tendencies. In addition, in recent years, Sichuan warlords have been fighting among themselves, with no measures taken for important border defense matters, and they have opened the door to foreign spying everywhere. As a result, Tibetan soldiers have repeatedly invaded, and there has been no political means to appease distant and capable talents, nor has there been military force to suppress illegal rebellions. Gradually, the Tibetans have become alienated, and their internal cohesion has been lost. The Kang-Tibetan disputes, which originally belonged to the scope of local problems, have spread into a major concern for the western border defense.</p>
<p>Observing the current situation, if we still do not seek solutions based on facts, the danger in the future is truly unpredictable. The solution should first seek a way out from Tibet itself. The Tibetans must obey, and the border defense must be roughly stable before it is possible. Now that the Dalai Lama has passed away, the political and religious affairs in Tibet have lost their master. There is particular fear that powerful neighbors will take the opportunity to advance aggressively, while Tibet itself still has no one to preside over the affairs. Therefore, the central government should quickly urge the Panchen Lama, who is currently in China, to return to the west as soon as possible to take charge of everything. If the Panchen Lama is concerned that the Tibetans are not completely convinced and that the Tibetan and Wei factions have not resolved their disputes, then the central government should provide him with the necessary financial resources to prevent him from being impoverished, and help him with the strength to defend himself. Even if there are people who are wavering, his power will be sufficient to quell them. Only then will Tibet itself have a foundation of self-reliance. Secondly, since Tibet has been established as a province, it is necessary to pay attention to it. The central government should strictly order Liu Wenhui to quickly reorganize his military equipment. Liu's troops must be given appropriate supplies and reinforcements when necessary, and capable officials should be selected and sent to Kang for guidance, explaining the major plans for establishing the country and the importance of border defense, and reorganizing the army. On the one hand, this will let those who invade from the east know that China is not incapable, and on the other hand, it will show Liu's army the way to fight and break the bad habits of Sichuan warlords' private interests, and establish the foundation of western border defense. This is the time to do so. If this can be done, then we can have earnest negotiations with the British. With the existing friendly relations between China and Britain, they should also be able to assess the current situation and seek a fair and practical solution.</p>
<p>Next to the Tibetan disputes is the turmoil in Xinjiang. The conflict between Sheng and Ma has been prolonged and seems to be coming to an end for the time being. However, now that Ma has been defeated and retreated, the problem in Kashgar has not been completely resolved. The boundaries between the Hui and Han people have not yet been eliminated. The way to clarify the situation cannot be achieved through empty words. Sheng's actions are only enough to protect himself, and Ma may not be sincerely inclined to the central government. If we want to achieve long-term stability and security in the new province, we must station troops on the border and extend the Longhai Railway north to Dihua and south to Kashgar. When transportation in the northwest is completed, border defense can also be roughly stabilized. Not only that, but the people in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai are exhausted and abandoning goods on the ground. If railway transportation is completed, the general national economy can obtain the support of natural resources in the northwest, and the adjustment of raw materials can be obtained in the southeast. If this can be done, then the immigration policy will naturally be realized, and military operations will be included in it.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the autonomy of Inner Mongolia. Judging from the current situation, the political problem in Inner Mongolia seems to be coming to an end. The director in charge of the autonomy has been appointed, and the Mongolians can engage in the autonomy they hope for. The bright future can be sought through cooperation between the upper and lower levels. However, there are some things that we still cannot refrain from saying. First, we must be cautious about preventing strong neighbors from spying and puppets from instigating trouble. Everyone knows the inside story of Puyi's usurpation of the throne. The intentional effort to win over the Mongolians is also a prominent event. Moreover, they have long sent out scouts in all directions. The footprints of vagrants are everywhere north and south of the desert. Recently, there have been frequent alarms on the border of Jehol. In the distance, the railway from Yizhou to Chengde has been gradually built and is beginning to take shape. How can the newly established Mongolian autonomy have the strength to confront the imperialists? Its economic capabilities are unusually weak, and its political organization is even less strong. It is already very difficult to gradually develop, and it is even more difficult to use it to withstand the impact of strong neighbors. As a matter of urgency, we should make the Mongolians understand their own crisis. If they do not unite with the country, it will be difficult to survive. At the same time, political measures and economic improvements must be implemented in a timely manner and should not be delayed any longer.</p>

<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources from official circles here, the British government is now working hard on the issue of air force disarmament and will soon invite various countries to participate in an air force conference in London to seek a balance of air forces. It is also stated that Britain will take this action only after France rejects the Eden disarmament proposal. At a time when the international disarmament agreement has been declared a failure, the British government is urgently seeking the security of the British Air Force, because the British Air Force is currently ranked fourth or fifth in the world. According to military sources here, the British government hopes that Germany, Italy, and France will participate in this air force conference to seek to limit the air force power of the three countries. It is believed that if Soviet Russia is also invited to participate, France may join this conference. (Thirteenth National Telegram)</p>

<p>Seventeen New Ships Will Be Added</p>
<p>Singapore is Considered an Important Far East Defense Line in Wartime</p>
<p>(London) After several hours of debate, the House of Commons finally passed the naval budget bill this morning. The total amount of the bill is £56,550,000, which is £2,980,000 more than last year. This budget will be used to build four cruisers, one flagship of a small fleet, eight destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three submarines. (Thirteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Situation of the House of Commons Debate <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(London) Admiral Keyes spoke in defense of the Singapore base when the House of Commons debated the naval budget bill today. When Naval Minister Monsell presented this budget, he said:</p>
<p>The Army and Air Force Should Be Given Equal Importance at the Same Time</p>
<p>He said that in terms of technology, economy, politics, or peace, Britain cannot recognize 10,000-ton battleships. It is regrettable that some people are making fruitless arguments about the relative advantages of the navy and the air force. It should be known that both the navy and the air force are necessary for the British Empire. It is also absurd for some people to point out that battleships are outdated. In fact, the navy cannot lack this thing, and there is no disagreement among naval personnel on this matter.</p>
<p>Battleships Are the Backbone of the Navy</p>
<p>Battleships must always be the backbone of the navy. If the main ships are reduced to 10,000 tons per ship, then smaller, stronger countries with cruisers will have the right to combine with a stronger country and overturn the relative power ratio.</p>
<p>Cruisers Are Being Added Sequentially</p>
<p>As for cruisers, Britain is limited by the treaty to only 339,000 tons of cruisers before the end of 1936. Although it is allowed to build 6-7,350 tons, Britain will build 32,000 tons of cruisers this year. If all of them are built, then in 1935 and 1936, there will only be 19,000 tons of new ships that can be built, which is not enough for the normal progress of the annual projects. Britain will be able to obtain the full tonnage of cruisers by the end of 1936, as allowed by the treaty, but there will be a shortage of 60,511 tons of destroyers that are not old enough, and a shortage of 4,000 tons of submarines that are not old enough. However, the total tonnage of these two types of warships that is allowed is not short.</p>
<p>Submarines Seek to Ensure Safety</p>
<p>The Navy Department has now made important decisions on the difficult problem of submarine sinking and life preservation. The Navy Department has determined that it is impossible to rescue the crew by raising the sunken submarine in time. Using the old method of salvaging ships is unlikely to save lives. Therefore, all submarines will be equipped with the Davis's invented underwater escape device, so that the crew can rely on their own efforts to save their lives. Currently, submarine personnel are being trained to use this device. A training pool has been set up in Gosport, England, and pools will also be set up in Hong Kong and Malta for training. (Twelfth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Labor Party Members Speak Out Against</p>
<p>(London) Subsequently, Hall, a member of the opposition Labor Party, vehemently criticized the Navy Department for increasing the construction costs of the Singapore naval base at the same time as the army and air force expenditures, saying that this project would cost a lot of money. The only reason why the Labor Party government in 1931 did not stop it was because the contract had already taken effect. However, after the Labor Party government stepped down, in less than three years, the MacDonald government (i.e., the current coalition government) completed the entire construction project.

Without it, Britain would not be able to assist Australia or New Zealand, and would not be able to fight on the Eastern Seas.

<p>The Navy Is Behind and Must Catch Up Quickly</p>
<p>Lord President Baldwin said that this budget bill does not irritate other countries, but only seeks genuine compensation for Britain's security. The government had hoped that Britain would take the lead in small cruisers, and that other countries would follow suit, but this hope was not realized. The other two major naval powers have each built several 10,000-ton cruisers, and equipped them with larger gun emplacements than the London-style gun emplacements. This is why Britain has built new-style cruisers and equipped them with gun emplacements that can rival the new cruisers of other countries.</p>
<p>Singapore Shipyard Must Be Set Up</p>
<p>Baldwin also defended the expenditure of the Singapore base, saying that the Singapore shipyard would be useless under the original plan. What the government is doing now is to add water pumps and power stations, so that the shipyard is definitely beneficial. (Twelfth Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>British Sense of Maritime Freedom Threatened</p>
<p>(Geneva) The "Geneva Daily" published an article entitled "Britain's Security," the conclusion of which roughly stated, "The United States has recently greatly increased its navy and air force, and Japan has followed suit. Britain will naturally not allow others to surpass it, and will not care how heavy the burden is. Britain's greatest concern is the maritime liberalism advocated by the United States. British territories are all over the world, and maritime transportation is the lifeline of Britain's country. It must be protected no matter what. However, if Britain wants to ensure maritime security, it must cooperate closely with European countries that have colonies, such as France, the Netherlands, and Italy. This can be seen from today. British diplomacy is obviously close to the views of European countries on the issue of disarmament, especially France. This may be one of the reasons." (Twelfth Havas Telegram)</p>

Seiyukai member Sadakichi Kageyama asked whether the government's consumption reserve of 1.65 million yen at the Indo-Japanese Conference and other international conferences had any effect. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that the World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference did not achieve the expected results. The Indo-Japanese negotiation will be resolved soon. Currently, only the special tariff issue has not been resolved. Kageyama asked how Japan's diplomatic work is in response to the fact that various countries are now vigorously building economic countries and expanding their military equipment. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that future diplomacy will focus on economic issues. The government has sought opinions from all parties through the Commerce and Trade Council, considered countermeasures, plans to open up new markets in South America and other countries, and strives to engage in immigration. The situation of various countries regarding military equipment is expected to ease before the 1935 Disarmament Conference. The Minseito Party member Fusanosuke Maeda asked how the British-Japanese negotiation not only affects the cotton industry, but also affects the entire export of Japanese goods. What is the government's view on this? Foreign Minister Hirota replied that the outcome of the British-Japanese negotiation is of greatest concern to all countries. However, since the meeting is a commercial discussion, the business community should conduct negotiations and study compromise points. The government should not directly intervene. If an agreement cannot be reached on the market issue, it is planned to negotiate on other issues. (Thirteenth Japan Union News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Italy Determined to Use Force to Aid Austrian Independence</p>
<p>Rome In this eventful autumn in Europe, politicians from various countries are rushing around, hoping to resolve international disputes through diplomatic means. However, alarming news has come that war clouds are densely covering the Austrian border, and a powerful army has gathered. According to investigation reports, in addition to the German National Socialist Party and the Austrian army on the Austrian border, Italy has also concentrated 40,000 people, as well as 40,000 from Czechoslovakia and 30,000 from Yugoslavia. The troops of the above countries are all ready to wait for changes in the situation. According to official sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös this week to coordinate the conspiracy of the German National Socialist Party to annex Austria. Prime Minister Mussolini believes that if Austria cannot maintain its own independence, the ebb and flow of the combination of European countries will never stop, and the opportunity for war is dangerous. Because the League of Nations conferences and the great powers conferences to resolve European disputes have failed, Prime Minister Mussolini cannot remain silent any longer, so he is taking unilateral action to seek to combine with countries that are related to Italy's own political and economic interests. The Balkan countries are now preparing for an incident. If the German National Socialist Party's plot to drive out Dollfuss is realized and a National Socialist government is established in Austria, then the countries will definitely prepare to deal with it with force.

<p>Madrid - The general strike here has completely failed today. Public transportation and passenger cars are operating as usual, workers are working as usual, and there have been no disruptions to public utilities. Only a few textile factories have workers engaging in slowdowns in the factory to protest the factory owners not increasing wages. Military police intervened and expelled the striking workers from the factories. Out of caution, the authorities ordered three daily newspapers to cease publication. One is the "Atalante" newspaper, the organ of the non-Moscow communist party, one is the "Solidarity" newspaper, the organ of the syndicalist labor union federation, and one is the "Struggle" newspaper, the organ of the union opposition. Four people who incited the strike were arrested, two of whom were members of the Socialist Youth League distributing strike leaflets. Only a few large factories in the entire province of Catalonia are on strike, but the nature is absolutely peaceful. According to the latest news, the workers are preparing to return to work in the afternoon. All the newspapers here unanimously oppose the strike, saying that the motives for the strike are difficult to understand. The "Humanity" newspaper said that the strike is absurd and harmful, and that the people of Catalonia should join the government and reject the troublemakers, whose intention is to plunge the province's democratic republic system into chaos and danger.

<p>Sasebo - The Naval Ministry announced that the ill-fated Tomozuru was towed by the Tatsuta to Tawarapu near Anosaki outside Sasebo Port at 7:00 AM this morning. It is avoiding wind and waves there and starting to rescue the crew members. On the other hand, the ships and flying boats attached to the Sasebo Garrison Squadron have been dispatched to search for crew members on the sea and coast outside the port. At 12:45 PM, it was discovered that there were survivors in the rear of the Tomozuru. The rescue team bravely transported air into the boat, placed electric lights in the water, and transported milk and other food. At 3:05 PM, three engine crew members were rescued from the rear. The three engine crew members who were rescued from the brink of death are in good spirits, so there may be more survivors to be rescued. The entire rescue is expected to be completed around 10:00 PM. Currently, the Tomozuru in Tawarapu has four floating barrels tied to both sides to increase buoyancy. On one side, the hull of the boat is being hollowed out to try to rescue from there. According to a crew member of the Tatsuta, the ship that towed the Tomozuru, the red hull of the Tomozuru was facing the sky, and while drifting, two crew members jumped out, intending to be rescued, but they were both washed into the sea by the waves and disappeared. At that time, due to fog, waves, and wind, the Tomozuru was towed at a speed of only one knot. The sound of people inside the Tomozuru knocking was unbearable. (Dentsu News Agency, 13th)</p>

Upon receiving the order from Rear Admiral Suzuki, the garrison commander, they immediately began the exercise of attacking the Tatsuta. At that time, the Chidori led the formation, followed by the Tomozuru. The Manazuru did not participate in the exercise due to engine failure. The Chidori and Tomozuru sandwiched the Tatsuta in the middle and pursued towards Shishiki Island. At that time, the wind and waves were very strong, and seawater was constantly washing the deck. The ship's body tilted very sharply, and objects inside the ship fell one after another. The exercise ended at 4:30 AM. At this time, the Tomozuru's firing signal suddenly disappeared, and it was known that it was missing. The Chidori and the flagship Tatsuta worked together to search for its whereabouts.

<p>(Tokyo) - The House of Representatives convened at 1:00 PM today. Naval Minister Osumi made a temporary request to speak and reported the course of the torpedo boat Tomozuru's accident. He said that the cause of the incident has not yet been determined. After the warship "Hayasui" encountered an accident in the past, the naval authorities studied shipbuilding technology and implemented countermeasures for various tasks. However, this time another incident occurred, which is very regrettable. In view of this incident, the authorities will take necessary countermeasures to ensure that no such incidents occur in the future.</p>
<p>Uchida Shinya of the Seiyukai party raised an emergency question about this. The Tomozuru is one of the First Replenishment Plan, and it has only been a few days since its launch. It is regrettable to hear this report. According to reports, the waves were three meters high at the time of the Tomozuru's accident. Such waves are not uncommon. It is a disgrace for Japan's proudest new warship to have an accident at the entrance of a naval port, which makes the people doubt the concept of national defense. Regarding the issue of building sixteen torpedo boats of 600 tons or less in the Second Replenishment Plan, I once advised Naval Minister Osumi on their performance. However, the authorities plan to complete them before 1937, when the London Naval Treaty expires. What is the reason for this? Does the naval authority still intend to continue building the sixteen torpedo boats in this Second Replenishment Plan?</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi replied that the naval authorities have now decided to organize an investigation committee with the greatest authority to investigate the cause. The Naval Minister then reported the news that three crew members of the Tomozuru had been rescued. The entire assembly applauded to express their gratitude. (Japan United Press, 13th)</p>

The Democratic leaders were shocked, but they expected that the bill might not be passed in the Senate. Even if the Senate passes it, President Roosevelt will veto it. It is also doubtful whether Congress will be able to override the President's veto with a two-thirds majority in the future. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>(London) - The financial community believes that the continued firmness of the silver market is not due to special demand, but to the reluctance of those who have silver in hand to sell it. News from the United States indicates that President Roosevelt is bound to expand his plan and purchase large quantities of silver, because the purchase of gold has failed to achieve its goal of raising prices. No one knows whether this statement is reliable. However, American speculators have taken in approximately 200 million ounces of silver, and they will eventually have to sell it. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>Market prices are not expected to rise immediately, but they are also not expected to fall sharply, because the U.S. National Recovery Administration may not adopt plans that do not impede the real progress of the business. In general, as long as business activities arising from private consumption do not increase as much as they currently do, the U.S. authorities will not allow their efforts to reform to hinder the recovery. Therefore, in the coming months, it is advisable to continue to hold a bullish attitude towards market prices, especially for public bonds.</p>

<p>Comrades of the New Life Movement, today everyone has enthusiastically come to participate in this meeting despite the wind and rain. This spirit is commendable. Judging from this spirit and atmosphere of today's meeting, we can be fortunate for the success of the New Life Movement and, at the same time, even more fortunate for the prospects of the revival of the Chinese nation. The significance of today's New Life Movement mass meeting is very important. It not only requires everyone, regardless of farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, men, women, old, or young, to participate, but also requires everyone, men and women alike, to implement it. In the past, the lives of the Chinese people were old-fashioned, out of step with the times, and incompatible with public and collective life. From today onward, everyone must change their past old lives into new lives. Only the discipline of a new life is in line with the times and with public and collective life. There is an old Chinese saying that goes, "Each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep and doesn't care about the frost on their neighbor's roof." Now, the slogan of our new life must change to each person not only sweeping the snow from their own doorstep but also sweeping the frost from their neighbor's roof. Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has slightly indicated to us that "the New Life Movement, based on the principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, and the new life implemented through propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, is the foundation for the resurrection of the Chinese nation." From this, we can know the importance of the significance of the New Life Movement. Regarding the principles of the New Life Movement, there are three in total. If we act according to these principles, the New Life Movement can be successful. What are these three principles? In terms of time, the first is to think in your heart, the second is to write with your hand, and the third is to put it into practice with your body. The time for the first and second – thinking, writing, and speaking – has passed. From now on, everything depends on the effort of doing. As time is like this, so is space. First, our leader decides the methods; second, the staff plans the projects; and third, everyone must do it. Now, the leader's decision on methods and the staff's planning of strategies have also passed from today, and what follows is for each of us to do. We must understand that the New Life Movement is a mass and universal matter. It won't work if we rely on my leader alone, and it won't work if we rely on a small number of leaders. Only when everyone does it can it be successful. The New Life Movement is the foundation for transforming the national life, saving the country from danger, transforming society, and transforming occupations, etc. I hope everyone has a deep understanding and works hard to do it. This is the significance of today's meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Chiang's Admonitory Speech <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Compatriots of Nanchang from all walks of life, today everyone is holding the New Life Movement here. Judging from the spirit and order of this movement today, the people of Nanchang can be a model for the Chinese nation, and the people of Nanchang can be the foundation for the revival of the Chinese nation. This Chairman feels very honored and satisfied to participate in it together with all of you. We must know why the Chinese are subjected to foreign aggression and why they are looked down upon by foreigners. Here, we should think about whether the physique of us Chinese is stronger than that of foreigners. Furthermore, we should ask whether the learning and behavior of us Chinese are as disciplined as those of foreigners. Comparing the families, schools, and societies of us Chinese with those of foreigners, are they as clean and tidy as those of foreigners? Other things like eating, dressing, and walking, can we be as orderly and disciplined as foreigners? These various aspects of daily life, foreigners can do, but we Chinese cannot do them all. Therefore, the lack of discipline and the lack of cleanliness and tidiness in life affect the lack of physical strength. When foreigners come to China at any time, the Chinese do not have the strength to resist. This is the reason why the Chinese are subjected to foreign aggression and looked down upon by foreigners. In other words, the Chinese do not know how to cherish their bodies and protect their bodies. If they do not even know how to cherish their bodies, how can they love the country and protect the country? Today, the purpose of the New Life Movement, first, is to make everyone a strong citizen. If we want the country to be strong, the citizens must have strong bodies, then there will be great power, and they will have the power to protect themselves, and then they will have the power to protect the country. This way, they will not be bullied by foreigners. Compatriots of Nanchang, especially young students, should know that if you want to love the country, you must first protect your bodies. How can we protect our bodies? We must do it according to the rules of the New Life Movement. If you cannot do it according to the rules of the New Life Movement, then you cannot protect yourself. Are those who cannot protect themselves not wronged by their parents for giving birth to this body? Moreover, people who cannot cherish their bodies are not only ruining themselves but also affecting the decline of the nation. Such citizens will only be bullied by foreigners forever and will eventually not be able to avoid becoming slaves of a subjugated country. Therefore, everyone must know that if you want to be a proper citizen who is in line with the times, you must follow the rules of the New Life Movement. The rules of the New Life Movement, such as knowing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, abiding by the rules, and loving cleanliness, etc., are all telling everyone the principles of being a good citizen. I hope everyone can understand and can do it, be a filial son at home, a good citizen in the country, a good student in school, and a strong and excellent member of society. This is the most important significance of the New Life Movement. The life you have lived in the past is the old life. The old life is called a barbaric life by foreigners. What is a barbaric life? It is equivalent to the life of ancient times. But now the new life has begun. From today on, we know the principles of the new life and do it accordingly, and from then on it will be a civilized life. Would you rather live a barbaric life or a civilized life? I think you would definitely rather live a civilized life. In that case, you must follow the New Life method, abide by the rules, know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, such as dressing neatly, wearing your hat properly, respecting your parents at home, and respecting your teachers at school. The Premier Sun (Yat-sen) told us that we must be loyal, filial, faithful, righteous, loving, and sincere. The New Life Movement is also following the Premier's teachings, so that everyone can be loyal to the country and to their superiors, be loving to their friends, and be filial to their parents and teachers. If you understand these and can do them, it is called a civilized life that is in line with the times. People who do not understand these principles can be said to have lived in vain. Today, compatriots from all walks of life have this spirit and order, and the spirits of our Chinese ancestors in heaven must have great hope, hoping that you will save the country and save yourselves. Compatriots, from now on, do not live a barbaric life again, you must achieve the new life. This is your work to save yourselves and save the country. In addition, there is one more thing to tell you, that is, do you know what kind of background I have? I think you know that I have been a Commander-in-Chief, and I have also been the Chairman of the National Government, and now I am also the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. What kind of person I was before, you must not know. When I was a child, I was taught by my parents and teachers every day to sweep the floor, mop the floor, cook and wash the dishes. When eating, if a few grains of rice accidentally fell, and when dressing, if two buttons were not buttoned, I would be punished by my parents and teachers. You must know that I am also a former elementary school student. Because my parents and teachers can strictly teach me, I can receive the teachings of my parents and teachers. Everyone should understand that a person is not born to be a revolutionary leader. If you can work hard, everyone can be like me. If you can achieve this kind of life, I believe that Nanchang will be able to create a large number of great people in the future to save the country and save the people. Today, I personally set an example and teach everyone, hoping that everyone can work hard and complete the revolutionary work, and I hope that everyone will start from today.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Masquerade Parade <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting ended, it was already past 3 o'clock, and the teams were immediately organized for the parade. In order of sequence, first were the academic circles, then the women's circles, then the business circles, the Party and government agencies, the labor circles, the people who participated freely, and the military police last. Starting from the venue, they proceeded to Huanhu South Road, turned to Zhongshan Road, and dispersed at the entrance of Deshengmen. The military police were divided into groups to maintain order along the way, and the order was good. Men, women, old, and young stood neatly on both sides of the road, without any crowding. Moreover, the accompanying military police corrected the unkempt clothes of the audience, regardless of whether they were male or female. The masquerade propaganda teams demonstrated drunkenness and opium addiction, and the middle school students of Jiangxi Province portrayed the ghost-like appearance of opium addicts, carrying a coffin on their backs with the words "Dead but not buried" written on it, which was especially enough to make people wake up. When the parade reached the intersection of Desheng Road and Huanhu Road at 4 o'clock, Cheng Shih-kuei, Director of Education Department, immediately supervised the boy scouts of various primary schools, lined up in two rows to maintain order on the left and right sides of the road. As soon as a team arrived, he directed the team according to the distance of each team's return route and dispersed them along the Yanjiang and Shawo roads to avoid mixing before and after. After each team had dispersed, Director Cheng gathered the boy scouts of various schools again, stood in a row in front, sang the New Life Movement song aloud, then shouted slogans, played music and dispersed.

<h3 id="e102">Calls for Development in Sichuan Province <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Cables Liu Xiang to Form a Branch of the Economic Commission</p>
<p>Sichuan Province Prepares to Establish an Economic Control Commission</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: In recent months, talk of developing Sichuan Province has been rampant. Because Sichuan Province has been known since ancient times as the "Land of Abundance" with fertile land and abundant products, if it can be operated with determination, it can easily become the foundation for a strong country in the future. Therefore, the authorities in Sichuan have long determined the three steps of suppressing bandits, rehabilitation, and development for reorganizing Sichuan. Domestic enlightened people are also paying attention to this. From the Chinese Science Society holding meetings in Sichuan to the Shanghai Journalists' Group coming to Sichuan to inspect, there is also an organization of a Sichuan Inspection Group of the Chinese Institute of Engineers. Recently, Zhang Gongquan and others from the Shanghai banking industry also plan to organize a group to come to Sichuan for inspection, preparing to make large investments. The Ministry of Industry has repeatedly sent personnel to Sichuan last year to inspect mineral and industrial enterprises, and then specially appointed Fan Chongshi as the Sichuan Oil Mine Commissioner, with Liang Qiyu, the section chief of the Mining Department of the Ministry, as his deputy. Fan and Liang have formulated an exploitation plan and submitted it to the Ministry. The Shanghai Guohuo Bank plans to invest 500,000 yuan to support this cause. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Economic Council, Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, and Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, are also scheduled to come to Sichuan next month to inspect industrial enterprises. Song recently sent a cable to Sichuan, instructing Liu Xiang to be responsible for preparing the Sichuan branch of the Economic Commission. Previously, an American doctor visited Liu Xiang, praised the abundance of mineral deposits in Sichuan, and volunteered to contact the Luo's Fund Committee in the United States to invest in Sichuan. Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, also agrees to complete the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway as soon as possible, advocating the issuance of public bonds with Sichuan salt revenue as collateral to serve as a railway construction fund. It can be seen that all parties are very sympathetic to the development of Sichuan.</p>
<p>The Rehabilitation Supervisory Office has also convened Sichuan industrial talents several times to discuss and study the development plan for Sichuan, advocating starting with improving local products and promoting production. The recent large-scale holding of the Thirteenth Sichuan Industrial Exhibition is intended for this purpose. A notice has been issued to all county construction bureaus or section chiefs in Sichuan to attend the meeting in person, and all donations and taxes that should be paid along the way for the items to be exhibited are waived to show promotion. Moreover, the promotion of imported goods and all enemy goods is prohibited at the site. This spirit is far from what previous industrial exhibitions could compare. Recently, an industrial conference was convened, deciding to establish a local product improvement committee organized by industrial institutions and specialized talents. Once it is effective in the future, it will be reorganized into the Sichuan Provincial Economic Control Commission. The conference convened its second preparatory committee a few days ago. In addition to determining the name of the Local Product Improvement Committee, it was also decided to organize seventeen specialized committees for Liangshan paper industry, Zinei grain industry, Peng County ceramics and silk weaving industry, cotton weaving industry, dyeing industry, tea industry, and various mining industries. The Supervisory Office first telegraphed the county magistrates of Liangshan, Pengshan, Zizhong, Neijiang, and other counties to send specialized talents engaged in various special industries in their respective counties to the province within March. On the one hand, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in this city were instructed to introduce various specialized talents. The municipal government and the Industry Department are responsible for reviewing qualifications, reporting to the Supervisory Office, and hiring them separately. Once specialized talents arrive at the Department, they will hold an inauguration conference at the same time as the Local Product Improvement Committee. It is also heard that the Supervisory Office also has a change in the education policy, and has determined to focus on vocational education and train more technical talents to promote local product enterprises. Six vocational schools will be prepared to be established in Chengdu, Chongqing, Guanxian, Xufu, and Jiading. The Sichuan University and Chongqing University will be reorganized, and the Industrial and Agricultural Colleges of Chengdu will be moved to Chongqing and merged with Chongqing University as a branch of Sichuan University, focusing on science. Sichuan University in Chengdu will focus on liberal arts. The annual funding should be at least 1.2 million yuan. (Guowenshe)</p>

<p>[Repelled by Xie's Regiment of the Guangdong Army]</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Chiang Dingwen returned to Xiamen on the 3rd, he convened a bandit suppression meeting on the 5th. Those present included Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Front, Li Yutang, Commander of the Third Division, Fan Songfu, Commander of the Seventh Division, Li Yannian, Commander of the Fifth Division, Zhao Nan, Chief of Staff, and Lin Wensheng, Director of the Headquarters. They discussed the method of liaison between the Southeast and Northwest Route Armies. The Shantou Eastern District Pacification Conference opened on the 5th. Li Yangjing, Zhang Ruigui, Huang Renhuan, Huang Yanzhen, Huang Zhiwen, and other generals all arrived. In addition to discussing local pacification issues, the dispatch of troops to suppress bandits in Jiangxi was also discussed. After the meeting on the 8th, the division commanders and representatives of the regiments all returned to their original defenses on the upper reaches of the Han River and the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. It is heard that most of the Jiangxi bandits, due to the pressure of the Central Army in northern Fujian and eastern Jiangxi, gathered in Guangchang, Shiyu, Ruijin, and Huichang, in the mountains along the Jiangxi-Fujian border. Before dawn on the 4th, over 1,000 bandits under Ye Jianying of Huichang Junmenling invaded Qingxi Sanbiao Xu. Xie Zheng's regiment stationed in Sanbiao sent troops to intercept them and met them in battle at Longgang Yaziwu. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., the fighting was fierce on both sides. Xie Zheng ordered the machine gunners to charge with grenades, and the bandit front line wavered. By 5 o'clock, they were defeated and returned to Luotang. Qingxi was not occupied. The Eighth Division sent an additional Chen Fengshao regiment to guard Qingxi. Now Luotang is in the hands of the bandits. The area is close to Xunwu and only tens of miles away from the border of Wuping and Pingyuan. It is the hub of land transportation between Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, and it is the only passage that the Guangdong Army must pass through to attack Junmenling. It is heard that the Central Government has given each route army a deadline of May 1 to recover the counties in the bandit area and pursue and suppress the bandits in order to fundamentally eliminate them.

<p>Survey Team Has Reached Leiyang</p>
<p>Guangdong-Hunan Border Line to be Constructed</p>
<p>Hengyang Communication: The Canton-Hankou Railway's southern section from Hengzhou had previously been surveyed by the railway's engineering bureau, which dispatched the fifth and sixth surveying teams to carry out the measurement. They have now reached the Leiyang county border. Once the route between the Mi and Lei rivers is surveyed within the next two to three months, the entire section from Zhuzhou to Gongpingxu south of Leiyang, approximately 230 kilometers, can be put out for public bidding and construction can commence. As for the section north of Dashimen in Guangdong, crossing the provincial border and reaching Baishidu in Hunan, it has been approved by the Ministry of Railways for immediate construction. The terrain from Baishidu to Chenzhou is more complex, requiring careful comparison of various routes before a final decision can be made. Furthermore, to facilitate experienced contractors from other locations to bid on the railway, the railway engineering bureau has agreed with the Ping-Han Railway Bureau to charge workers transported by contractors at one-quarter of the ticket price, in addition to the existing free transportation of workers by the Canton-Hankou Southern Section Administration in Guangdong. The Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau will allow free accounting. This will not only encourage more contractors to bid but also reduce the cost of road construction. (March 7th)</p>

<p>Meeting Convened for District Reorganization</p>
<p>The county government previously received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs, stating that local autonomy in this province has been implemented since the spring of the eighteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929], and it has been five years with no significant achievements. While the reasons are not uniform, the excessively detailed division of local autonomy regions, causing difficulties in both talent and economy, is the most important reason. After discussion at the internal affairs meeting of the Ministry of Interior, a method for re-division was adopted, seeking convenience and submitted to the provincial government for approval and notification to all counties for compliance. According to the regulations, counties with an area of less than 2,000 square miles should not have more than eight districts. County Magistrate Jin, acting on this principle, scheduled a meeting for re-division today (14th). In addition to the district chiefs, the director of the property management office, the chief of the county government's secretariat, and members of the Party branch were all present.</p>

<p>Plans to Widen East, West, and Central Market Streets</p>
<p>The east, west, and central market streets inside Chang Gate are busy areas in Suzhou City. Banks and money shops are densely packed. The Wuxian Construction Bureau is actively planning to widen these two streets and has completed the planning. Yesterday, it was submitted to the Construction Department for review and approval. However, the Chang Gate city gate will no longer be suitable after the widening of the streets, so a decision has been made to rebuild it, and it is currently being designed.</p>

<p>Measures to Ban Subletting of Silk Factories</p>
<p>Before the sixteenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1927], there were only eighteen silk factories in Wuxi County. After the sixteenth year, more factories were added, totaling forty-nine. However, most of the added factories sublet the factories and collect interest. Each silk reeling machine requires a deposit of approximately twenty silver taels, and the monthly rent is approximately three taels and five qian. Some speculators took advantage of this opportunity to deceive farmers into borrowing money and opening factories. Unexpectedly, the silk market collapsed, resulting in heavy losses and successive closures. Disputes such as those involving the Huisheng, Qingfeng, and Taixin factories have not yet been resolved. For the sake of rectification, the county government has drafted seven provisional measures to ban subletting silk factories and submitted them to the provincial government for review and implementation. The measures are as follows: (1) These measures apply to all silk factories that rent factories for business within Wuxi County. (2) Before signing a lease, any person who rents a factory for business shall first submit in writing the names of the operating shareholders and managers, the total amount of capital, and the name, number of machines, and location of the silk factory to be rented to the Silk Factory Guild. The guild shall send personnel to verify the capital and report to the county government for record before signing the contract with the factory owner. (3) The total capital mentioned in the preceding article shall be at least one hundred silver dollars per silk reeling machine. (4) Any person who rents a factory for business shall deposit the wages guarantee deposit for female workers in a bank after signing the lease and submit the deposit book to the Silk Factory Guild before starting business. The guarantee deposit is temporarily set at twenty silver dollars per silk reeling machine, and more will be added proportionally. (5) After receiving the guarantee deposit book, the Silk Factory Guild shall issue a receipt and report it to the county government for record. (6) When a rented silk factory declares closure, if there is no outstanding wage payment, the Silk Factory Guild shall return the guarantee deposit book based on the actual closure and report it to the county government for record. (7) Violators of the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 shall be ordered to suspend business upon investigation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Communications received a report from Xi Zhiqing, Zhang Jun, and other citizens of Zhouzhuang Town, Jiangyin, stating that the Xinlijiang, Lida, Feifeng, and other small steamships owned by the Licheng Shipping Bureau of Wuxi have not been repaired for many years and are very dangerous when operating on inland rivers. After receiving the report, Director Peng checked the small steamship measurement inspection and registration certificate regulations. Article 21 stipulates that the navigation period for inspected and qualified small steamships shall not exceed one year and shall not be allowed to navigate after the expiration date without re-inspection. The Xinlijiang and other small steamships have exceeded the time limit without repair, which violates the regulations. Yesterday, he sent an official letter to the county government requesting an immediate investigation to determine whether they are navigating. If they are navigating, they should be ordered to apply to the bureau for inspection. Otherwise, they should be ordered to suspend navigation to uphold the law.</p>

<p>Robbery of Four Households in Hudian, Lakeside</p>
<p>Xiaohudian, located only two miles outside the southwest gate of Changshu, is home to a private shaman named Shen Wangshi, who enjoys considerable fame and a decent life. Because she is known as "Shen the Immortal," Shen also considers herself an immortal. Her family has accumulated considerable wealth and fears being coveted by bandits. In the eastern corner of her house, she built a single-eyed stove to secretly hide gold and silver jewelry and silver dollars inside. It was usually peaceful, but the location is close to the shore of Shang Lake. Suddenly, on the night of the tenth, a group of twenty to thirty bandits came from the lake and swarmed into Shen the Immortal's house. They stripped Shen of her clothes, tied her with hemp ropes, poured gasoline on her breasts, and burned her, forcing her to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Shen initially refused to confess, but after being unable to endure the pain, she told the bandits. The bandits then dug up the single-eyed stove and found more than a thousand yuan in banknotes and silver, ten gold rings, five pairs of gold bracelets, two gold pendants, a pair of gold bracelets, silver ornaments, and clothing, totaling approximately four to five thousand yuan. After the robbery, they also robbed neighboring homes, affecting four households. Fortunately, the losses were minor. Shen was also shot once during the robbery, with the bullet entering her buttocks. She is currently receiving treatment in the hospital, but Shen is nearly seventy years old and has suffered greatly, so her life is in danger. The Public Security Bureau has received the news and has sent personnel to the countryside to investigate.</p>

<p>Large Group of Bandits Rob and Injure People</p>
<p>Xu Daiming, a resident of Xidaiming in the southwest of Daxing Town, Second District, is engaged in farming and reading and has a wealthy family, which has attracted the attention of bandits. On the midnight of the tenth, more than twenty bandits speaking local dialects suddenly came, carrying box guns, rifles, and shotguns, and rushed into the house. They went directly to Xu's bedroom, dragged Xu out of the bed, beat him with fists and feet, and forced him to hand over silver dollars. When he refused, they beat Xu's wife with a bench, causing serious injuries to both. The bandits then searched the house at will and left after about an hour. Upon inspection, the losses were estimated at more than one hundred yuan in banknotes, clothes, and ornaments. Yesterday, it was reported to the county government, requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Involved Shanghai-Dalian Trading Company</p>
<p>Enticing Retired Chinese Postal Workers</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: Recently, Chinese postal authorities suddenly discovered that a Japanese organization called the "Shanghai-Dalian Trading Company" was colluding with retired postal workers to transport mail between China and Puppet Manchukuo. The representative of the company is Mr. Ohara. Xinsheng News Agency has obtained two confidential letters issued by the company regarding this case, which appear to be addressed to postal personnel, as well as a copy of the mailing procedure, translated and published below. It is hoped that the Chinese postal authorities will conduct a thorough investigation and crackdown.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Two Confidential Letters <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>(1) Dear Sir, After four months of satisfactory work, we were appointed by one of our Japanese staff in the Dalian Post Office to serve as steamboat postal workers, and instructed us to secretly mail the mail directly to designated institutions through the high seas. Your mail is also entrusted to us. In this way, the confidential mail will be connected to the Dalian First Railway and arrive without being delayed by the organization's sorting. It is not necessary to replace our registered receipt with a Dalian Post Office receipt, because we can now issue a Dalian receipt when we receive it. Your faithful representative, Ohara, January 26, 1934. Please send letters to P.O. Box No. 3125. (2) Dear Sir, The delays in receiving mail to Europe caused by sending mail through the Siberian local post office, resulting in delays in receiving mail from Siberia to Europe, have caused you discomfort. The establishment of this trading company can alleviate this. Mail to Europe is now sent via the Suez Canal and takes approximately thirty-five to forty-two days to arrive. As for Siberia, it only takes seventeen to nineteen days. This company is composed of three</p>
<p>postal commissioners and four representatives. The representatives recently retired from the postal service because they have completed their thirty-year terms. Every ship of the Dalian Steamship Company has one of our staff members from here to Dalian. We ask you to do a secret job, which is to take your mail from Shanghai to Dalian and then mail it there for further mailing via Siberia. Entrusting our postal service will be in private contact with us. We will handle it in a way that does not conflict with international postal treaties, so your mail is fully guaranteed. You can also register your mail, and when the responsible personnel return from Dalian, they can exchange the Dalian Post Office receipt for the registered receipt we issued. Chinese stamps and tariffs will be added to your mail because they respect the sovereignty and monopoly of the country's postal service. This was recognized by all members at the International Postal Conference held in London in 1929, and Dalian is also one of the members. This is a secret matter, which was banned by the Nanjing government after the Manchurian Incident. We sincerely request you to keep the secrets of this organization because, in case the post office finds out, this agency will have to close immediately. If you are unwilling to do so, please burn this letter. (Signed the same as the previous letter)</p>
<h3 id="e117">Mailing Procedure <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>(1) Please prepare your mail the day before the steamer sails, and please do not add any stamps, just like we are going to do. (2) The day before the ship sails, our representative will go to inform you, calculate the number of pieces, issue a registered receipt, and estimate the postage, and bring those mails to this agency to pay the fees and send them out. (3) At the end of each month, or after you receive the reply, we will do a collection and sorting job. If you still need a better guarantee, we can also give you a responsible senior postal worker in the Shanghai Post Office General Bureau. (4) Our reward is ten cents per piece, regardless of its weight and size. The total number of mails we send each time is limited to three full mailbags, so we sincerely ask you whether you are willing to participate in this opportunity. Please give us a reply. If the answer is negative, we can still find someone else. We are honored to be your faithful servant. Shanghai Dalian Trading Company, signed by representative Ohara.</p>

<p>Hired Cars in the Evening to Transport Them Back to the Factory</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: All the workers of the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory had a dispute over the factory's reduction of wages. At around 5:00 a.m. yesterday morning, they set off in batches, gathered at the May 30th Cemetery in Zhabei, and walked together to the municipal government in the downtown area to petition. They did not arrive at the municipal government in succession until 12:00 noon. The entire police force of the seventh district and first sub-office was armed and on guard.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Response: After the workers arrived at the municipal government, they elected ten representatives, including Huang Baofu, Feng Xianchun, Lü Haiquan, Xia Zhiwei, Zhu Linchai, Cai Hangsong, He Yayun, Weng Bingyan, Liu Yanqing, and Pan Yuancai, to enter and petition. All the workers gathered in the square in front of the municipal government to wait. The municipal government sent Yuan Xinglu from the second section to receive them. The representatives handed over the petition and reported the details of the dispute and the details of the workers being arrested and beaten by the French patrol, requesting that a protest be filed with the French authorities and that the factory be ordered to withdraw the order to reduce wages. Mr. Yuan replied, (1) Regarding the incident of workers being beaten, it is a matter of criminal law and can be sued in court. (2) Labor-management disputes will be investigated and mediated by the Municipal Government's order to the Social Affairs Bureau. The representatives expressed their dissatisfaction and insisted that the municipal government must file a protest with the French authorities. Mr. Yuan finally instructed the workers to report the details of the conflict in detail and then verify it.</p>
<p>Dispersed Late: The representatives withdrew to report the answers to the workers, who expressed their dissatisfaction and stood still. After repeated persuasion by the municipal government, the workers still refused to leave, insisting that the municipal government must have a definite and satisfactory answer. The situation was quite serious for a while, and it had not dispersed until 6:00 p.m. After hearing the news, the General Labor Union immediately sent Yu Yaoqiu to rush over and persuade them again and hired many moving cars to transport the workers back to the factory in batches. It was not until about 8:00 p.m. that the transport was completed.</p>

<p>Some members of the Shanghai business community's investigation team to Shandong, including Wu YunChu, Hu Xiyuan, and Xu Zhiyi, returned to Shanghai by the Shanghai-Ping Express train the night before last. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency met with Mr. Wu YunChu, who reported the following gains from the trip. Mr. Wu first said that he and others were warmly received by all sectors in Shandong, for which he was very grateful. As for the investigation, it was only a rough idea due to the limited time. Shandong's industry and politics are gradually on track, so there is progress every day. This time, I saw that the electrical industry along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is very developed. However, Yanzhou is slightly blocked. As for the flour mills, they are very developed because it is a producing area and the residents eat wheat. Chairman Han is now working hard to connect the hydraulic engineering project of Xiaoqing River's Wuliu Gate. After the completion, it will greatly benefit the local people because it can make the river water flow directly into the sea. Finally, he said that he regretted that he was unable to investigate in detail due to his busy schedule. The reporter asked what plans there were for the future. He replied that in April, the team still planned to go to Sichuan Province because Chairman Liu had sent several telegrams inviting them, and so on.</p>

<p>Bogomolov Has Entered Beijing Some Days Ago</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: The bizarre news about the assassination of Soviet Russian Ambassador to China Bogomolov, which was published in local Japanese newspapers, was denied by the Russian Consulate yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency asked Mr. Mirikovski, the deputy consul of the Soviet Union in Shanghai, about this news. Mr. Mi initially did not want to express anything, only saying that he did not know. He then said that the rumors were completely groundless. According to other personnel at the consulate, the Russian ambassador entered Beijing some days ago. The newspaper reported that the ambassador planned to go to Hangzhou on the 24th of last month but stopped because he learned of an assassination attempt. This was not true. Ambassador Bogomolov had not prepared to go to Hangzhou at all, and there was no so-called cancellation. Only the Consul General of Russia, Mr. Spielvanik, went to Hangzhou once because of the problem of herring being detained. However, Mr. Shi has returned to Shanghai for a long time, and nothing has happened, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Rickshaw Operators Appeal <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Write to the Taxpayers' Association to Strive for Taxpayers' Association to Argue Forcefully</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry convened its fourth board meeting at 7:00 p.m. on the 12th of this month due to the upcoming date of the rickshaw owners' congress. The attending functional committee members Xia Muyao, Zhu Hegao, Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, and Lu Dexin and twelve others publicly elected Zhu Hegao as chairman. The meeting proceeded as usual, discussing the order of the conference and the following proposals: (1) Proposing that the conference stipulate the highest rental price for the rickshaw industry to unify the case. (2) Proposing how rickshaw owners should improve vehicles case (3) How should this office plan to start the rickshaw puller relief work case? (4) Proposing to request the Public Works Department to discuss the improvement of the rickshaw industry and publicly elect representatives to participate in the case. At the end, the document stock read out a letter requesting the Public Works Department's Chinese directors to uphold justice and the rickshaw owners' very detailed declaration, and so on. Appendix letter, to the addressee, I am writing to you because I have recently read the Public Works Department Gazette of the Public Concession, which contains the report of the Rickshaw Committee, which discusses many aspects of improving vehicles and relieving rickshaw pullers. It is not without merit, but in fact, there are many obstacles to implementation, just like unraveling silk and scraping the feet to fit the shoes. For example, due to the dissatisfaction of one or two foreigners (Rotary Club Beek and others) with our industry, there is a request for the Public Works Department to organize a committee to investigate, and without getting the details, there is a suggestion to suspend the issuance of licenses for 2,000 vehicles, and to form a new company with these 2,000 vehicles for profit-making, as a step towards reform. It is using the power of the authority to cater to the selfishness of one or two foreigners to undermine the interests of the Chinese and infringe on the right of taxpayers and legal rickshaw operators to obtain licenses and operate, which violates legal principles and humanity. If other industries in the concession handle affairs in the same way, even if there is no way to take advantage, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no flaws, and they will be in danger, and there will be more troubles from now on. I hope that you, as directors, will represent the Chinese people and protect their rights. This act of encroaching on the business of Chinese merchants must be handled fairly and strive for the board of directors of the Public Works Department to uphold the legal and inherent operating rights of the Chinese people in the concession, so as to maintain the livelihood of the tens of thousands of working people in our industry and to secure the survival of all industries. I am grateful to you. Respectfully, the Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Guild, March 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Appeal from Sugar Merchants for the Confiscation Case of Native Sugar in Beihai <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Total Stoppage of Southern China's Native White Sugar Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>Pang Songhui Submits Additional Justification Again</p>
<p>Native sugar from various places such as Qiongyai, Qinlian, and other regions in Guangdong, being shipped to Shanghai, has been repeatedly fined and confiscated by the Jianghai Customs last year. Chambers of commerce and sugar merchants from those areas have sent representatives to Beijing to petition for relief. After months of investigation by the government, the truth has been clarified. The Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 1156 at the beginning of this month, approving the Ministry of Finance to instruct for a correction of the sugar testing standards and to confirm the inspection rights at the port of export. The part regarding the reversal of old cases is still under review. However, on January 23rd of this year, 92 bags of native white sugar belonging to the Beihai sugar merchant Henghelong were detained by the Jianghai Customs in the Gu Cang warehouse. Two months have passed, and they have not been released. Sugar merchants from various places are observing the situation. According to statistics, only over 300 bags of native white sugar from Southern China have arrived in Shanghai this year, compared to over 10,000 bags in the same period last year, a world of difference. Currently, it is the peak season for native white sugar production. Sugar workshops and farmers in various places have produced white sugar, piling up like mountains. Sugar merchants dare not transport it, and they are in dire straits. Pang Songhui, the representative of the petitioners, has drafted an additional justification and reiterated the previous request to the Customs Administration. The original text is excerpted as follows: For the case of the Jianghai Customs detaining native sugar from Beihai and forcibly confiscating it, a request for relief, supplemented with reasons, reiterating the previous request, respectfully requesting review and implementation. I, in secret investigation, on January 23rd of this year, the Qinlian sugar merchant Henghelong, transported 92 bags of K-mark native white sugar from Beihai on the Hubei steamer, to be received by Fu Tianshen in Shanghai. In the case of the confiscation by the Jianghai Customs, I have previously presented two relief methods, earnestly requesting a swift and rapid decision to be granted. A month has passed, and no instructions have been given for implementation, causing deep anxiety. Now, for the sake of the Honorable Administration to easily understand the truth and quickly resolve the matter, I especially supplement the reasons as follows: (1) From the perspective of customs administration, there is no reason for confiscation. The native sugar in this case was shipped directly from Beihai to Shanghai. Upon export, it was inspected by the Beihai Customs, confirming that it was produced by the Wulilu Lun Chang Sugar Workshop in Lingshan County and was indeed pure native sugar. It was released after paying taxes in accordance with regulations. According to export customs regulations, after the goods have been inspected and loaded onto the ship, the exporting merchant has no way to interfere. When the original shipment arrives at the destination, the importing merchant declares it for import. Therefore, in this case, the native sugar could not be changed or altered in any way from export in Beihai to import in Shanghai. Now, the Jianghai Customs claims that the inspection revealed more than half foreign sugar and confiscates it, which is truly perplexing. Ultimately, do the Beihai Customs and the Jianghai Customs follow the same tax system? Why is one releasing it first and the other confiscating it later? If it is because their sugar testing standards are different, they should blame themselves for the errors in their inspection policy, and they should not make sugar merchants suffer losses for following the regulations, thereby demeaning their own credibility. This is from the perspective of customs administration, where the Jianghai Customs's decision is wrong. (2) From the perspective of light measurement inspection, there is no reason for confiscation. The sole reason for the Jianghai Customs to detain and confiscate the native sugar in this case is that the inspection showed a optical rotation of 92.8 degrees, which is proof of more than 50% foreign sugar content. It is known that there are ordinary sugar and invert sugar in sugar content. Ordinary sugar rotates light to the right, while invert sugar rotates light to the left. The level of optical rotation changes with the change in sugar content. However, the change in sugar content does not have a fixed distinction based on whether it is imported or domestically produced, or whether it is machine-made or native-made. Therefore, it is absurd and groundless for the Jianghai Customs to consider sugar with a optical rotation of over 90 degrees as foreign sugar and sugar below 90 degrees as native sugar. Moreover, this standard is still based on that set three years ago, based solely on Fujian native sugar. They adhere to it for years without adapting, completely ignoring the progress of sugar production in Guangdong Province in recent years. Last year, the Central Industrial Testing Institute chemically tested Qiongzhou native sugar, with Grade C being 92 degrees and Grade B reaching 93 degrees. The error of the current standard of the Jianghai Customs has long been proven beyond doubt. Qinlian native sugar is inherently better than that of Qiongyai, but it is still being judged by old inspection methods without correction. How unfortunate is the Qinlian sugar industry? This is from the perspective of light measurement inspection, where the Jianghai Customs's decision is wrong, two. (3) From the perspective of declaring dissenting opinions, there is no reason for confiscation. It is known that among the recent confiscations of Southern China's native sugar by the Jianghai Customs, in addition to this case, there are also cases in Shantou and Haikou. Sugar merchants in other places all willingly accept the punishment and have not been heard dissenting. But why does the merchant dare not remain silent? The reason is that the government is cracking down on smuggled foreign sugar for the sake of maintaining tax revenue and for the sake of maintaining native sugar. If they can stop smuggled goods without harming the innocent, sugar merchants would be grateful beyond words and would have no reason to dissent. But who knows that the Jianghai Customs cannot distinguish right from wrong, and equate deer with horses. Because they discovered native sugar mixed with foreign sugar elsewhere, with a optical rotation exceeding 90 degrees, they also detain and confiscate the pure Qinlian native sugar exceeding 90 degrees. Those who uphold justice are still speaking out and providing relief, but how can those who are wronged remain silent? This is from the perspective of declaring dissenting opinions, which is actually a refutation of the Jianghai Customs's decision, three. (4) From the perspective of anti-smuggling punishment, there is no reason for confiscation. Our country has not yet implemented customs laws, and tax punishments are arbitrarily changed, making it difficult to obtain a fair resolution. The case of the Haikou brown sugar being fined, which is related to this case, is one example. It is known that the Haikou sugar merchant Ganrong transported 114 bags of brown sugar to Shanghai Guangyuan, which were inspected by the Jianghai Customs and deemed to be mixed with 80% foreign sugar. They only imposed a fine of 150 silver dollars and settled the supplementary tax. In this case, 92 bags of white sugar (weighing just half of the Haikou brown sugar case) were only deemed to be mixed with over 50% foreign sugar, but the entire shipment was confiscated. The circumstances of transporting native sugar for both cases are not different, but the severity of the punishment is arbitrarily reversed. From this analogy, it is not difficult to believe that the amount and existence of alleged mixed foreign sugar can also be uttered arbitrarily, shrinking or expanding according to emotions. Sugar merchants will never have a day of relief. This is from the perspective of anti-smuggling punishment, where the Jianghai Customs's decision is wrong, four. The reasons supplemented in this case are as stated above. Now, for the sake of the Honorable Administration's thorough understanding and convenient resolution, I will further clarify the cause of this case and state it as follows: Since the increase in taxes on foreign sugar, native sugar has sold well. Qinlian white sugar, due to its more refined production and cheaper raw materials, has made significant progress. Local people are celebrating this as a good phenomenon for rural revitalization. But who knows that unscrupulous merchants elsewhere, because foreign sugar taxes are heavy, smuggle to take advantage of loopholes, using counterfeit goods to confuse the truth and smuggle mixed goods to Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs has not thoroughly investigated the sugar production in various places, but only knows that the source is from Southern China, making it easy to raise suspicion in such a situation. Added to this is the fact that customs anti-smuggling would rather wrongly punish than let go. Therefore, the seemingly sunny goods face the difficulty of even Confucius being surrounded, and the same name as Zeng Shen does not prevent Zengzi from being rumored to be a murderer. The Qinlian sugar industry, in this situation where right and wrong are unclear, has repeatedly experienced detention and fines. Initially, it was due to a misunderstanding by the customs officers, enduring and bearing the injustice for a time. But unexpectedly, after months of concealment, there is still no day to see the light of day. The crux of the matter lies in the tax commissioner's stubborn preconceptions, disregarding objective facts, thinking that merchants are mostly treacherous and good sugar must be foreign sugar. How can they know that clear water and turbid water can be distinguished by comparison, and that orchids and bright pearls can be judged by re-inspection? Therefore, not hesitating to offend, I reiterate the previous request, respectfully requesting that the two relief methods presented in the previous report be carefully considered. Officials should be dispatched to the Qinlian sugar production area for a thorough on-site inspection, or the Qinlian Sugar Industry Guangyitang should be instructed to take samples of native sugar with public certification from local party and government organs and mass organizations and send them to Beijing for open comparison and re-inspection with the detained native sugar in this case. If there is evidence of tax evasion, I will gladly accept any punishment, even death by torture. Otherwise, immediately reverse the decision according to the law and establish a method to guarantee the safety of future transportation, so that sugar merchants are not constantly struggling in dire straits, then there will be boundless good fortune. I present this straightforward statement, respectfully requesting your review. Respectfully presented to Shen, the Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance,</p>

<p>The Ninghai Ship Aircraft Can Be Completed by the End of Next Month</p>
<p>The Jiangfeng Aircraft Will Fly to Various Places Next Month</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter recently met with Mr. Zeng Yijing, who provided a detailed account of the current situation and future plans of the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Construction of Additional Factory Buildings to Begin Soon <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Zeng, the Ministry of Navy, in view of the rapid progress of aircraft in various countries, decided to establish the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant to increase the Navy's auxiliary power. Later, due to the small size of the factory buildings, funds were allocated in the autumn of 1931 to expand the plant and build a workshop in front of the existing factory buildings. By the spring of 1932, the foundation of the workshop had been completed, but the January 28th Incident broke out, and the project was suspended. Subsequently, the Ministry of Navy drafted a plan and requested the Central Government to allocate funds for expansion. The Central Government approved and allocated over 100,000 yuan for expansion, but due to the Central Government's financial difficulties, not a single cent has been received to this day. Now, with the approval of Minister Chen, the Navy has managed to save 40,000 yuan from its own budget to be used for the construction of additional factory buildings at the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Plant. It has now been decided to build a two-story factory building on the existing foundation. The upper floor will be used as offices, and the lower floor will be used as a workshop. The new building will be 120 feet deep. The workshop on the lower floor will be divided into three rooms. The left and right sides will be wood and metal workshops, each 10 feet wide, and the middle will be an assembly workshop, 50 feet wide, which can accommodate the assembly of six aircraft simultaneously. The original factory building will be used to store aircraft. This plan was submitted to the Navy Department last Saturday and will be implemented as soon as it is officially approved. Further expansion plans, such as purchasing additional machinery, will have to wait until funding is available.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Ninghai Ship Aircraft to Be Completed by the End of the Month <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng continued, "The plant is building an aircraft for the Ninghai warship. The fuselage has been assembled, and the wing frames have also been installed. However, some parts have not yet been delivered, and the engine will also have to be installed after the fuselage is completed. Therefore, the entire project will be delayed until the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The cost of the aircraft is estimated at over 10,000 yuan. A steel-framed destroyer is also under construction and can be completed at the same time as the Ninghai aircraft."</p>
<h3 id="e132">Jiangfeng Aircraft to Fly to Various Places <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, the Jiangfeng aircraft, after being converted into a land-based aircraft, has undergone five test flights at the Longhua Airfield, conducting tests on high altitude, maximum speed, and normal speed, with excellent results. The aircraft is currently stored at the airfield and is scheduled to fly to Fuzhou and other places at the beginning of next month. Permission has been obtained from the Minister of the Navy. It is planned that Chen Chengqi will fly the aircraft. The first flight will be to Fujian, and the aircraft will return to Shanghai the next day. The second flight will be to Shantou and Guangzhou, and then to Hankou, Tianjin, and other places. This is intended to promote the achievements of our country's domestically produced aircraft and to practice flying skills and familiarize oneself with domestic air routes.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Ship Collision Meeting of the Navigation Administration <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Wanhsiang and Chaohsing Collide, Submitted to the Ministry for a Ruling</p>
<p>The Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee of the Shanghai Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation convened its ninth meeting the afternoon before last at 2:00 PM. The case of the collision between the Wanhsiang ship and the Chaohsing ship still needs to be submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for a ruling, so no conclusion was reached. The Bureau has now submitted a response to the Ministry of Transportation. The minutes of the meeting are excerpted below: Attendees: Peng Hu, Director of the Navigation Administration; He Daoyun, Chief of the Second Department; Zhang Zhuzun, Section Chief of the Second Department; Chen Ganqing of the Maritime Accident Insurance Company; Sha Yingcheng of the Pilots' Association; Xu Zufan, expert from the Wusong Merchant Marine School. Director Peng Hu presided over the meeting, and Secretary Chen Shiyan recorded the minutes. Matters discussed: (1) The case of the Tongshang ship of the Tonghua Shipping Company colliding with and sinking the Liu Longpu coal ship on the Jiangmian River in Xiaguan, Nanjing. Resolution: A letter will be sent to the Jiangning District Court. (2) The case of the Wanhsiang ship of the Sanbei Shipping Company colliding with and sinking the Chaohsing ship of the Chaohsing Shipping Company in the Huangpu River. The details of the collision have been investigated clearly, but both parties have their own version of events. The Bureau will submit a document to the Ministry for a ruling. (3) The case of the Daxing ship of the Antong Shipping Company damaging the Xinping ship of the Benping Shipping Company at the Wusong Estuary. Responsibility for the loss should be borne by Daxing. (4) The damage repair costs for the Hongxing ship of the Daching Shipping Company damaging the Lin Lifeng sailing ship. (A) The loss costs of Hongxing should be re-requested from the Bureau's officers for inspection. (B) The handling costs for the damage to Lin Lifeng. (1) The damage repair costs, estimated by the Jianghai Customs, should be compensated with 4,000 yuan. (2) The ship schedule loss should be compensated with 500 silver dollars. (5)</p>
<p>The case of the Lijiang ship of the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee colliding with the Meimaru barge of the Shanghai Yunlun Company in the Huangpu River. After mediation and handling by the Committee, the Shanghai Yunlun Company stated in a letter that they did not accept the verdict. What should be done? Please make a public decision on the case. After reviewing the case, the company first submitted the Meimaru loss list, and then, in accordance with the Bureau's notice, sent personnel to wait for inquiries. The company has already acknowledged the Committee's decision, otherwise, why did they not object at the time? Now that the case has been discussed and resolved, and no new evidence of rebuttal has been discovered, it is difficult to change the original decision.</p>

<p>Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Relief Work Group of the National Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, previously presented to Chairman Kong, with approval, the Relief Work Group</p>
<h3 id="e135">moved to Kaifeng <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>to conduct business in order to command and carry out the work nearby. It is learned that Director Kong went to the construction site on the 8th of this month. Secretary Xu Hongkui, et al., accompanied by various administrative and technical personnel, continued to proceed there on the 10th. As for Shanghai, Zhu Yong, Director of the Engineering Section, was left to handle affairs in Shanghai. The following is a recent telegram from Director Kong to Director Zhu, regarding the previous discussion on</p>
<h3 id="e136">the damming project <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>a certain correction has been made. The original telegram reads: "Director Zhu of the Engineering Section, No. 6, Bund, greetings. Recently, I read reports from March 8 in Bian regarding the Yellow River relief work discussed by Rong. Regarding the damming project, it stated that it was not at the Shuimenkou, but inside the Shuimenkou, on villages on high ground. A dyke of 25 meters high has now been built, but this height is still not enough to prevent the high floodwaters. It has been decided to</p>
<h3 id="e137">continue to increase its height <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>by ten meters, etc." This does not match what was discussed. The damming project is not at the dike breach at Shuimenkou, but at the breach in the old beach village inside the dike. It has now been dammed to a height of 25 meters and a depth of 10 meters. Because willow stone protection measures are being applied, the depth has been reduced to</p>
<h3 id="e138">more than eight meters. <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Etc. Also, it was originally stated that blocking the Shuikou does not have to wait for the water to recede. It must be carried out during the flood season to increase the working strength by leveraging the water force. Therefore, it is planned to telegraph the water affairs agencies upstream and, upon the water rise upstream, immediately send urgent telegrams to Stone Village and other places, then calculate the time and start work, which is easier. If it is a project to block the breach, not only do we wait for the water to recede, but we also</p>
<h3 id="e139">take advantage of the opportunity to start work. <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, we also use the flood to guide the flow and directly inject it into the diversion river, deepening the bottom of the old riverbed. Therefore, I think it is best to telegraph the river affairs bureau upstream during the water rise and fall, so that they may notify this engineering site and proceed when the opportunity arises, which is more convenient. Regarding the relief work talk, please notify the newspapers to make corrections. Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Relief Work Group, gray."</p>

<p>Song Ziwen and Zha Liangzhao Send Letters Requesting Reconsideration</p>
<p>The impeachment case in Anhui Province, which caused a national sensation last year, by the Control Yuan, after multiple investigations by the Central Government Disciplinary Committee, drafted a resolution proving that the impeachment was false, clearing the names of the impeached individuals, Vice Chairman of the Flood Relief Committee Xin Puson, Director of the Urgent Relief Office Zha Liangzhao, Anhui Relief Commissioner Quan Shaowu, Bengbu Grain Station Director Deruizhi, and Transportation Commissioner Yang Shucheng, confirming that they were innocent and had not committed any malfeasance. This has been reported in newspapers. Although the Disciplinary Committee exempted Xin Puson and Deruizhi from disciplinary action, it also separately imposed reprimands and demerits on the remaining three individuals outside of the case details. The punished individuals believe that they have been wronged. Even if the accusers are not punished in return, why should they be punished outside of the case details? Moreover, based on the facts, this punishment is not deserved. This case concerns the future of disaster relief and the credibility and reputation of the Flood Relief Committee. If it is not corrected, enthusiastic individuals will view social relief as a daunting task. Therefore, they visited Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, requesting that he send letters to the Judicial Yuan and the Central Government Disciplinary Committee based on the facts, requesting a swift reconsideration of the proposed disciplinary actions, so as to clarify right and wrong and encourage action. Mr. Zha Liangzhao also sent an express telegram to the Disciplinary Committee. The original texts of the letters and telegrams have been found and are recorded below to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Letter from the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed National Government's Judicial Yuan and the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee:</p>
<p>We hereby inform you that, according to the reports submitted by Cha Liangzhao, former Director of the Emergency Relief Office of this Committee, Quan Shaowu, former Commissioner of Relief Affairs in Northern Anhui, and Yang Shucheng, former Transportation Commissioner, regarding the impeachment case concerning relief affairs in Northern Anhui, which resulted in penalties of admonition and demerit recording, we request that these reports be forwarded to the Judicial Yuan and the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for a swift review of the disciplinary actions in this case. We enclose copies of the original reports for your consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters</p>
<p>Enclosure: Original Reports</p>
<p>"Respectful Greetings to Chairman Song:</p>
<p>We have received the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee's order of February 16th, along with document Jian Zi No. 122, regarding the resolution of the impeachment case concerning relief affairs in Northern Anhui. The Committee, based on its investigation of the facts, has proven that the charges brought by Supervisory Committee Member Gao Yihan and others regarding (1) price changes, (2) short weights, (3) flour conversion, and (4) delays, were without any evidence of personal gain or corruption. Those subjected to disciplinary action should not be held responsible. For years, we have endured unjust accusations and suffering, which can now be alleviated.</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, beyond the scope of the case, we were given the punishments of admonition and demerit recording. The Committee may have other intentions, but the matter is extremely perplexing, and we feel wronged. Therefore, we must address the facts. The Committee resolved that, because Liangzhao, as the Director of the Emergency Relief Office, did not request that the sale of Bengbu wheat be waived due to the special circumstances in Northern Anhui, he was penalized with "one demerit recording". According to the facts, the price change of relief wheat was an integral part of the Water Disaster Relief Committee's overall plan to meet the needs of relief work, and Liangzhao had also contributed his opinions regarding the price change of Bengbu wheat. Therefore, Bei Ke, the Director of the Joint Storage Office, stated in his official letter explaining the reasons for the Bengbu price change, "The Joint Storage Office and the Emergency Relief Office strongly opposed it, fearing that the relief grain would not arrive and the food of the disaster victims would be at risk." (This letter is attached to this Committee's reply No. 396 to the Committee). Moreover, the Bengbu wheat sold at that time was intended for the urgent needs of the joint construction and emergency relief in the district. In terms of responsibilities, the Emergency Relief Office was not in a position to interfere, nor did it have any responsibility to bear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Committee resolved that Shaowu's "dereliction of duty" was due to his "being headstrong," and he was penalized with a "written admonition". According to the facts, this Committee, in order to promote relief affairs in Northern Anhui, established a separate special zone and sent Shaowu to cooperate with Chinese and Western relief organizations to actively implement relief. Within six weeks, the emergency relief work in Northern Anhui was completed expeditiously. Because he was loyal to his duty, he was subjected to jealousy and impeachment, and suffered the slander of being "headstrong". Those who falsely accused him were unable to achieve their aims, and intensified their efforts, fabricating various rumors and inverting right and wrong. This is why the Supervisory Yuan had the impeachment case concerning relief affairs in Northern Anhui, and the Anhui native association in Shanghai had the false accusation in the Shanghai court. Now, the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee has taken this as evidence of dereliction of duty and given him an admonition. Considering the facts, how can this be considered fair?</p>
<p>The Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee stated that Shucheng "only knew about private interests and not public interests," and was penalized with "two demerit recordings". According to the facts, Shucheng witnessed the suffering of the people affected by the disaster in Henan and Anhui, so he responded to the invitation of the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters while he was very busy with business, and asked to assist in the relief transportation. Before and after the January 28th Incident, he personally provided funds to fly to Shanghai, Hankou, and Zhengzhou to contact relief transportation vehicles for the Disaster Relief Committee. He obtained the consent of He Jingwu, Director of the Pinghan Railway, and Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway, to have the coal and troop transport vehicles heading to Pukou carry relief wheat on their return trips. At that time, Shucheng also sacrificed his personal business and personally stationed in Pukou to assist Yu Shaojun, the director of the grain station, in taking care of the relief wheat transportation for more than thirty days. Even those who were asked to assist with enthusiasm were purely voluntary and did not receive any remuneration from the Disaster Relief Committee. Furthermore, because the Shanghai War affected the sale of American wheat by the Disaster Relief Committee in Shanghai, Shucheng's Baoxing Flour Mill was consulted, and, in the interest of disaster relief, agreed to sell a portion of the American wheat on its behalf. The price offered was higher than the prices offered by other factories in Shanghai and the factory's own purchase price of Australian wheat. This can be verified by the financial records of the Disaster Relief Committee. Unexpectedly, those who falsely accused him claimed that Shucheng was profiting from it, and falsely accused Shucheng of delaying relief transportation. Therefore, we had to earnestly defend against the false accusations. Now, the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee said that Shucheng constantly debated, and identified him as "only knowing about private interests and not public interests," and gave him a demerit recording punishment. For the sake of right and wrong and for the sake of those who are enthusiastic about helping with relief in the future, Shucheng must state the facts in detail to defend himself.</p>
<p>In summary, the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, outside of the original impeachment case, imposed penalties of admonition and demerit recording on us, which are not deserved. How can we be willing to accept them? Furthermore, it concerns the entire honor of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters. Therefore, we earnestly appeal to the Chairman to forward our request to the Judicial Yuan and the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for a swift review of the disciplinary actions in this case, in order to clarify right and wrong and to manifest justice.</p>
<p>Cha Liangzhao, former Director of the Emergency Relief Office</p>
<p>Quan Shaowu, former Commissioner of Relief Affairs in Northern Anhui</p>
<p>Yang Shucheng, former Transportation Commissioner</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Jiang, March 3rd"</p>
<h3 id="e142">Cha Liangzhao's Express Mail Telegram <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>"To the esteemed Chairman Tan and members of the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee in Nanjing:</p>
<p>I respectfully telegram requesting a review of the disciplinary actions in the Northern Anhui relief impeachment case, in order to clarify right and wrong and to manifest justice. I have received the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters' forwarding of your Committee's order of February 16th and the resolution regarding the Northern Anhui relief impeachment case. After reading them, I am extremely perplexed. In the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic, Supervisory Committee Member Gao Yihan and others picked up rumors, disregarded the facts, and filed an impeachment case based on unfounded charges of "personal gain and corruption", falsely accusing Deputy Chairman Simpson of this Committee and Liangzhao and other colleagues handling relief affairs in Northern Anhui. Fortunately, your Committee has spent more than a year investigating in many ways, and has proven with facts that the allegations in the original impeachment case regarding the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters' price changes and flour conversion, etc., were without any evidence of corruption or error, and that the impeachers should not be held responsible in any way. We were hoping that your Committee would reveal the truth of this relief impeachment case, which has attracted national attention, and that the unjust accusations and suffering that we have endured for years would be alleviated. However, unexpectedly, your Committee has suddenly made arbitrary judgments about the handling of the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters' affairs at the time, and penalized Liangzhao with "one demerit recording". Considering the facts, the penalty is not deserved, and judging by the regulations, I dare not fail to defend myself. The reason for the disciplinary action given by your Committee's resolution is that Liangzhao "as the Director of the Emergency Relief Office, did not request that the sale of Bengbu wheat be waived due to the special circumstances in Northern Anhui." However, the attachment to the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters' reply No. 396 cited in your Committee's resolution (the official letter from Yun Ke, Director of the Transportation and Storage Office, regarding the price change of Bengbu relief wheat in May of the 21st year of the Republic) clearly states, "The Joint Construction Office and the Joint Relief Office strongly opposed it, fearing that the relief grain would not arrive and the food of the disaster victims would be at risk." This means that Liangzhao did contribute the above opinions regarding the measures taken by the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters at that time to meet the needs of relief work. Moreover, the Bengbu wheat that was sold by the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters during the Shanghai War was purely intended to meet the urgent needs of joint construction and relief in the Huai District, and had nothing to do with the Emergency Relief Office. Furthermore, your Committee's resolution also recognized that "the price change of relief wheat by the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters was part of the overall plan of the entire relief fleet to cope with the environment," and that "the cash sale of Bengbu wheat was a last resort at the time (due to the impact of the January 28th Shanghai War)". Liangzhao, as the Director of the Emergency Relief Office, could not be held "responsible" for it. As a member of the social service community, and for the sake of the Relief Committee for Flood Disasters' reputation, I dare not fail to state my views directly. Your Committee is clearly discerning and will surely make factual corrections to clarify right and wrong, so that society has a standard to follow, and the general public will not regard social relief work as a perilous path. This would be fortunate. I send this urgent telegram and await your orders with utmost anticipation. Cha Liangzhao, former Director of the Emergency Relief Office of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Yang, (March 7th)"</p>

It was immediately reported to the Xieji Customs Broker, which sent Lin Yinsheng to the Wusong Ship Registration Office of the Public Works Bureau to report the registration. However, the registration license was not obtained due to procedural matters. Unexpectedly, on the same day, a patrol boat from the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau discovered that the "Jin Wanxing" had not registered and intended to conceal the donation and evade taxes. A fine of forty yuan was imposed. The shipowner felt unfairly penalized and refused to accept it. Patrol officers then confiscated the boat's gear, canopy, and sampan. After Xieji learned of this, the plaintiff Lin Yinsheng filed a statement with the Registration Office, but was detained and sent to Shanghai until the evening, when he was released. This aroused the indignation of all Wusong customs brokers. On one hand, they filed a written complaint with the Shanghai Fisheries Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Wusong Branch Office, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government, requesting that someone be sent to investigate. On the other hand, they planned to convene a meeting of all customs brokers to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Letter to the Fisheries Association <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Fisheries Association:</p>
<p>Our company's "Jin Wanxing" merchant ship arrived in Song with aquatic products and fish at approximately 8:00 AM on the eighth of this month. Our company handled customs clearance and ship donation registration matters, and opened up the names of the shipowners and ship masters, and the location of the ship docking was reported to the Wusong Office of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau ship affairs office to check for registration. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM, the ship affairs office inspection boat came to Song and inspected the "Jin Wanxing" ship, and falsely accused the "Wanxing" ship of concealing the donation and evading taxes, and imposed a fine of forty yuan. The shipowners were unfairly penalized and could not bear it, and requested that our company send someone to explain to avoid being innocent. Our company sent an employee, Lin Yinsheng, together with the shipowner, to explain and prove and request a re-examination to avoid punishment. Unexpectedly, the inspectors Wang Chunsheng, etc., were unreasonable and not only did not accept our company's explanation, but also severely beat our employee Lin Yinsheng, and then arbitrarily detained him in the ship, imprisoned him in the cabin, sent him to Shanghai, forced him to sign a document, and detained him for more than six hours before releasing him. Tax donations are originally the obligations of the people. Now that the shipowner has already reported the application, it is not illegal or unreasonable. The inspector's order for extra punishment is inappropriate. Our company's sending of staff to provide proof and request a re-examination is also a proper procedure. Now, it has been unjustly insulted and detained. Not only has our company suffered injustice, but the shipowners will be unimaginable in the future. This letter is to the esteemed Fisheries Association, which will forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that officials be sent to investigate and remove from office to uphold justice and extend the humiliation.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3 id="e152">Ji Case Not Heard Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yuying and Others Did Not Appear in Court</p>
<p>Nor Did Any Representative Lawyer Appear</p>
<p>The case of Ji Juemi and Yu Xiaomeimei, who were previously sued by Xu Li, a woman, for the crime of enticing and abducting Xu Yuying, has already been judged innocent by the First Special District Local Court in the first instance. Later, Xu Li and others were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. They also filed a petition with the Supreme Court, requesting a transfer of jurisdiction. However, the Supreme Court has recently rejected the petition. Therefore, the Second High Court scheduled the trial for the afternoon of the 13th of this month. Because the addresses of Xu Li and Xu Yuying were unclear, the summons was served by public notice. Yesterday afternoon, when the scheduled trial date arrived, the appellants Xu Li and Xu Yuying did not appear in court, nor did any lawyers appear on their behalf. Therefore, the case could not be heard yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Wu Jianguang Accuses His In-Laws <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Even Wu's Own Daughter-in-Law is Among Those Accused</p>
<p>As a Result, the Daughter-in-Law's Part is Rejected and the Rest Will be Summoned Again</p>
<p>"It Started Because of Demanding Overdue Debts, Holding Grudges, and Coming to Make Trouble"</p>
<p>Wu Jianguang, who is blind, is originally from Meixian, Guangdong. He is seventy years old and has been running a fortune-telling shop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhili Road for decades. His son, Zhongliang, married Wu Huang, the second daughter of Huang Fuji, who is also from the same hometown. Last year, Wu Jianguang's wife, Wu Li, suddenly sued Huang Fuji's eldest daughter, Liang Huang, and Liang Huang's husband, Liang Yishan, in the Civil Division of the First Special Court for failing to repay a debt of one thousand yuan. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and the Liangs lost the case. When it came to the execution of the judgment, the Liangs still refused to comply. The court issued an arrest warrant and arrested Liang Huang. After paying bail, she held a grudge and went to Wu's place to make trouble. Therefore, Wu Jianguang hired lawyer Xi Yafu to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court, accusing his in-laws Huang Fuji, Huang's wife Zhong, Huang's son Peichu, eldest daughter Liang Huang, and second daughter Wu Huang, of offenses such as damaging property, theft, and insult. He also attached a private prosecution, requesting that the defendants be jointly and severally ordered to compensate the plaintiff for a fortune-telling tool and a loss of ten yuan. The content of the lawsuit stated that at approximately 6:00 PM on January 31st of this year, the defendants held a grudge and came to the plaintiff's home to make trouble. Without asking the reason, they cursed loudly, calling the plaintiff's daughter Wu Xiufeng a prostitute (note that Wu Xiufeng had a marriage dispute with Lu Xifan), and accusing the plaintiff of setting up a fortune-telling shop to make money and deserving to be kidnapped. They smashed all the teapots and teacups in the plaintiff's shop. A mahogany chair that the plaintiff was sitting on was also damaged, and the plaintiff's fortune-telling tool of more than fifty years was also stolen. The patrol officers from the Laozha Police Station arrived and went to the police station together. Later, because they were relatives, they did not pursue the matter further. However, the defendants' actions violated Articles 325 of the Criminal Law regarding defamation, Article 337 regarding theft, and Article 382 regarding damage to property.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Xiangzu presided over the hearing of this case in the Fifth Criminal Division. All the defendants were present and hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to defend them. The plaintiff Wu Jianguang immediately claimed that because my wife previously accused Liang Huang and others of owing money, and the court issued an arrest warrant and bailed them out, the defendants came to make trouble and fight at 6:00 PM on January 31st. Among them, the defendant Huang Zhong was the most ferocious, accusing me of swindling money and kidnapping, and calling my daughter a prostitute. The most hateful thing was that they stole my fortune-telling tool, which I have needed every day for fifty years, making it impossible for me to eat. As for their insulting words, if I wanted to tell them all, it would take several hours, and I don't want to say more now. He then presented the teapots, etc., as evidence. The defendants were questioned,</p>
<p>They all denied fighting and destroying property. Judge Wu reviewed the confessions and evidence, stating that the case still required further investigation, and ordered a postponement until the 22nd of this month for another hearing. He also advised both parties' lawyers to try to reach a settlement during the postponement, and if the settlement failed, the trial would proceed. Huang Wu, because she is the plaintiff's daughter-in-law, cannot be sued according to law, so the rejection was declared.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Chen Chunpu's Appeal Rejected <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Liu Hanyi (Chenggan), a wealthy merchant from Nanxun, previously accused his treasurer Chen Chunpu of having an affair with his four concubines, the Zhus. The First Special Court declared Chen innocent. Chen believed that Liu's action was a knowingly false accusation made to the authorities in order to frame him. Therefore, Chen filed a suit against Liu for false accusation in the First Special Court. The initial trial ruled Liu Hanyi innocent. Chen refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which also concluded the hearing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhao Zhengcheng, together with Judges Zhou and Jiang, opened the First Criminal Division and announced the judgment: The appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Li Monong, Son-in-Law of Central Committee Member He Xiangning, Was Sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau Yesterday <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui and Others Appeared in Court to Request Bail for Li</p>
<p>The Court Approved the Transfer Because It Was a Case of Aiding and Abetting</p>
<p>Li Monong, the son-in-law of Central Committee member He Xiangning, was investigated by the Municipal Public Security Bureau as an important member of the Communist Party, currently serving as the Propaganda Minister and concurrently on the Pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Committee. He was arrested together with Wang Weimin, who was with him, by detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station on Jing'an Road at the intersection of Tongfu Road ten days ago. They were sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Li denied being a member of the Communist Party, saying that</p>
<h3 id="e156">Evidence Could be Collected from Hong Kong <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>and requested an extension. This was approved and he was detained pending further questioning. Yesterday morning, when the date for the continued hearing arrived, at 9:30 AM, the Head of the Criminal Division of the Second High Court, Yu Ye, and Judges Zhao Zhengcheng and Zhou Han, opened a joint panel and ordered Li and Wang to be brought to court. In addition to the investigating detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau who went to court to receive them, the Bureau's legal advisor, lawyer Zhan Jifeng, also went to court to request a transfer. Li Monong's family hired lawyers such as Wu Kaisheng to defend him. On one hand, He Xiangning asked</p>
<h3 id="e157">Party and State Elders <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, and others, to guarantee him at the court. Therefore, yesterday morning, Elder Wu, together with Central Committee members Liu Yazi and Zhu Shaoping, went to court to listen to the proceedings. After the court opened, lawyer Wu Kaisheng made two requests: (1) Please extend the case for two more weeks, because the evidence from Hong Kong has not yet been collected and sent to Shanghai. (2) Please grant Li Monong bail. The reasons for the bail request were that</p>
<h3 id="e158">Liao Zhongkai <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>had made great contributions to the Party and the country, and even if his descendants were to go astray, they should be treated with leniency. Moreover, He Xiangning is currently ill in bed and needs someone to take care of her. Therefore, he requested bail. If approved, Party and State Elder Wu Zhihui and representatives Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, and Zhang Taiyan will jointly guarantee that he will continue his studies and serve the Party and the country. However, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that the other party had previously requested an extension, saying that evidence could be presented, but now there is still no evidence presented. Therefore, he</p>
<h3 id="e159">Objected to the Continued Extension Request <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The court then ordered the investigation to begin. The Municipal Public Security Bureau representative presented a self-declaration from Zhao Lin, the secretary of the Communist Party's Pseudo-Soviet Provincial Committee, as reported in the newspapers, proving that Li Monong was indeed an important member of the Communist Party, and requested permission to transfer him. Zhao Lin then testified after surrendering, stating: I used to be the secretary of the Pseudo-Soviet Provincial Committee, and I have now surrendered. Li Monong was a staff member of the Propaganda Department of the Pseudo-Soviet Provincial Committee. Later, he was promoted to</p>
<h3 id="e160">Propaganda Minister <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>I came to Shanghai in June of last year, and I first saw Li in February of this year. I also saw Li during the Lunar New Year. When questioned, Li Monong denied knowing Zhao Lin, and said that during the Lunar New Year, I was still in Guangdong and only arrived in Shanghai three days before being arrested. Then, Prosecutor Zhong Qing rose to speak, saying: This case is about aiding and abetting, and the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer is in accordance with the agreement. Please, the presiding judge, handle it according to law. The police lawyer also stated that the case had obtained documents with</p>
<h3 id="e161">Communist Color <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>and had been verified by Zhao Lin. The evidence was sufficient. The police had no objection to the transfer by the Public Security Bureau. Finally, lawyer Wu rose to defend Li and reiterated the request for bail. After the court finished speaking, it retired to discuss the matter. After a moment, it returned to the court and announced its ruling: Li Monong and Wang Weimin, together with the evidence, were transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Each Vehicle Costs 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Public Omnibus Company of the Public Concession has contracted with England to build forty double-decker buses, including all machinery, chassis, and other components. One vehicle has already arrived in Shanghai. The company has completed assembly in Shanghai and has begun test runs, which have proven to be very stable. According to investigations by the Huadong News Agency reporter at the company, the double-decker buses are scheduled to officially begin operations on the 20th of this month. However, due to the height of the bus, some overhead power lines along the route are too low and obstruct its operation. The Concession Tram Company is currently working to modify these lines. If the modifications can be completed before the 20th, the buses will definitely begin operations on that date. Otherwise, there may be a slight delay. These double-decker buses have 34 horsepower. The lower level can carry 40 passengers, and the upper level can carry 34 passengers. The entire body is made of steel and produced by the British Tilling Stevens factory. Due to the high price of the buses, the engine is a German diesel engine. After operations begin, the initial route will be Route 1, from Zhaofeng Garden to the Park Shooting Range, passing through Yidingpan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Seymour Road, Tongfu Road, Mahuo Road, New World, Ballgame Field, the Bund on Nanjing Road, Tiantong Road, the Shooting Range, the Japanese School, and Shigaota Road. The fare for the lower level will remain the same, while the fare for the upper level will be higher, but the maximum increase will be no more than four copper coins. The first stop will cost eight copper coins, two stops twelve, three stops sixteen, four stops twenty, and five stops twenty-two. Subsequently, each additional stop will cost two copper coins, up to a maximum of forty coins. The ticket format for the upper and lower levels will be the same, but the upper-level tickets will have the letters "U.S.A." added. In the future, there will be two conductors assigned to each bus for the upper and lower levels. Children under the age of five will ride for free. It is said that the cost of each bus is approximately 30,000 Chinese yuan. (The above picture is a photograph of the double-decker bus.)</p>

<p>The Railway Bureau plans to develop small gardens along the major stations of the two railways. The Railway Bureau has previously issued orders to the Traffic Department to make preparations. At the same time, it ordered the Property Section of the General Affairs Department to send personnel to coordinate the matter. The section has now agreed on the procedures with the General Affairs Section of the Traffic Department. First, the engineering and traffic departments will instruct their respective sections to survey suitable locations at each major station, create drawings, and submit them to the Property Section for review. If the land is leased, it will be reclaimed from the tenants. The Engineering Department will prepare a plan and cost estimate for the arrangement of the garden and submit it to the bureau for approval. The purchase of flowers and trees will either be sourced from the Ningbo section or prepared by the Jiaxing nursery. The Property Section will consult with the nursery after the locations have been determined. The first steps are currently underway.</p>

<p>Mother-in-Law Seeks Justice for Daughter-in-Law; Thug Flees Guiltily</p>
<p>Ultimately, Justice Prevails; Questioning Official Respects Humanity</p>
<p>Sun Genfa, 26 years old, a local, lives in Tanjiacai, Zhabei. He owns several tiled houses. Besides his own residence, the remaining houses are rented out to others. He lives with his elderly mother, surnamed Shao, who is 52 years old, and his wife, surnamed Li, who is 26 years old. Recently, Genfa has been away on car business, leaving his mother and wife alone at home. Unexpectedly, a tenant named Wang Dechang, seeing that Genfa was often away and that his mother and wife were both women who could be bullied, frequently harassed Li. Being a traditional woman, she was well-mannered and sternly refused. Wang, shamed into anger, took advantage of Shao's absence on the afternoon of the 28th of last month at about 6 p.m., when Li had just returned to her bedroom after collecting rent from another tenant, Zhou Zhengyu. Wang broke into Li's bedroom and used barbaric means to force himself upon her. Li, feeling humiliated, cried for help. Nearby neighbors gathered to watch. Wang, enraged, beat Li severely, causing her body to be covered in injuries. Afterward, he used vile language to humiliate Li. After suffering this humiliation, she felt depressed and secretly purchased raw opium to ingest in an attempt to kill herself. When discovered, she was sent to the Renji Hospital in the Concession for treatment, but she died at around 4 a.m. on the 31st. Her family took custody of the body for burial. Wang Dechang, feeling guilty after Li's death, moved all his belongings to another location in an attempt to escape. Yesterday, the deceased's aunt, along with the deceased's mother, Li Gao, and witnesses Wu Gongquan and Zhao Ruyao, went to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to seek justice. District Chief Lai dispatched police officers to arrest Wang Dechang. District Chief Zheng Zuhan interrogated Sun Shao, who recounted the events. Li Gao stated that she was 68 years old, from Gaojiaxiang, Pudong, and that the deceased was her daughter. She was informed by Shao, but when she arrived, her daughter had already died. Both women pleaded for justice. Witness Wu Gongquan stated that he was 24 years old, from Suzhou, and lived at 1557 Zhongxing Road. That evening, he happened to pass by the area and saw a crowd gathered. Li was crying loudly. He heard from the crowd that Li had been beaten for rejecting Wang's harassment. Zhao Ruyao stated that he was 30 years old, from Shanghai, and worked as a postal worker living at 82 Huakang Road. He learned that the above situation was true when he was delivering mail. Wang Dechang stated that he was 50 years old, from Anhui, and lived at 2 Tanjiacai and ran a weaving factory. He denied harassing Li and did not admit to beating the deceased. The interrogating official stated that since multiple people had testified that Wang Dechang had beaten Li, resulting in her death, it was a major homicide case and should be sent to the Public Security Bureau for thorough investigation in order to uphold humanity.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Victim of Prostitute Murder Case Autopsy Yesterday Reveals Death by Poisoning Then Stabbing <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Strange Sounds Heard In The Deceased's Room</p>
<p>Security Guard Terrified, Sets Off Firecrackers All Night For Reassurance</p>
<p>In the Chizhi brothel opened by Yangzhou native Wang Fushou at No. 15 Hengmaoli, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, 18-year-old Yangzhou prostitute Wang Guixiang accompanied Tianjin customer surnamed Wang to sleep in the front room on the third floor of the brothel on the evening of the 11th. Around 9 a.m. the following morning, it was discovered that the prostitute had been stabbed to death and the customer surnamed Wang had also sustained severe stab wounds. Upon receiving the report, the French Police dispatched detectives to investigate. No murder weapon was found in the room. Because the customer surnamed Wang had serious injuries and was unable to speak, the truth was difficult to ascertain. The customer was transported to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the prostitute's body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary to await an autopsy. Details of the matter were previously published in this newspaper yesterday. Yesterday morning, the Second Special District District Court Prosecutor's Office received a report from the Police and commissioned Prosecutor Wang, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Peng Xiang, to visit the mortuary at 11:00 a.m. to conduct an autopsy. The deceased's body was wrapped in a cotton quilt, wearing a striped white flannel shirt and trousers, a rose-red crepe silk short cotton jacket, and a gray worsted cotton jacket. She had unbound feet, wearing silk stockings, without shoes. Her hair had been cut off, and her face was completely purple-black. Her eyes were tightly closed, and the tip of her tongue was slightly protruding from her mouth. Blood foam was flowing from her mouth and nose. The buttons on her chest were unbuttoned. There was a forceful wound in the center of the sternum, about the size of a broad bean, about three inches deep. There were no bloodstains on her chest, only on the bed sheet. There were several clumps of bloodstains flowing from her mouth and nose. After a detailed examination of the external appearance by the forensic doctor, it appeared that she had been poisoned first and then stabbed to death. In order to clarify the true cause of death, the clothing worn by the deceased was removed. The chest was dissected, and two sloping knife holes were found on the stomach. The knife head had been inserted slightly, and then withdrawn slightly, without leaving the wound, before being inserted again diagonally. The blood in the stomach was examined again, and it was confirmed that she had been poisoned before being stabbed to death. Half a teacup of liquid was extracted for the police to test. The examination lasted for an hour before it was completed. The judge took his seat and first heard the report from Detective Zhang Chunsheng on the results of the investigation. Prostitute servant Zhu Dengfu testified that he was sleeping on a small shelf when he heard the customer surnamed Wang running from upstairs to the half-stairway, shouting "Someone, someone." He went out to look and saw Wang standing on the staircase. He called out to the owner to check the front and back doors downstairs first, which were locked. When he returned to the third floor, he saw Wang sitting on the bed, also wounded and bleeding. Miss Guixiang was already dead on the bed. He did not know how the two of them were injured or killed. Brothel madam Wang Zhang testified that she heard Zhu Dengfu shouting and went out to look and saw Wang standing on the staircase, wearing a short coat. When Wang returned to the room, they went up and saw Wang sitting by the bed, also with a knife wound on his chest, bleeding. Guixiang was already dead on the bed. Being a young woman, she was terrified. The old man was involved in a lawsuit, and there was no one at home, so she ordered the maidservant Wang Fang to report to the patrolmen, etc. However, no family members of the deceased came forward, and the brothel was unwilling to claim the body. The court ruled that Wang Guixiang died from poisoning and stabbing. The body was photographed and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The police department was ordered to arrest the perpetrator and bring them to justice. It was also reported that after the case occurred, the brothel madam and servants were too frightened to stay in the house, leaving it empty. At night, patrol officers were dispatched by the police to guard the house until late at night, and they heard strange sounds from upstairs. The patrolman was also alarmed and reported to the head patrolman, who dispatched several more patrolmen to guard the house and set off firecrackers to provide reassurance all night, but no sounds were heard. This was also a miracle.</p>

<p>Discovered Three Days After Hanging</p>
<p>The Scene Can Be Described as Tragic</p>
<p>Chen Meiyu, also known as Huiying, a dancer from Ningbo at the Xinxin Dance Hall on Guizhou Road, was twenty-three years old. She was quite attractive and known for her romantic nature. Several years ago, she met Tang Guanlin (twenty-seven years old), a neighbor from Pudong. After that, the two communicated their affections and met in secret, like inseparable lovers. Last year, they rented a house together at No. 1257 Siwenli, Datong Road, and lived together. However, Tang had been unemployed recently, so Chen was entirely responsible for their livelihood through her performance. Over the past year, Chen began to feel disdain for Tang's lack of employment and started to seek pleasure elsewhere. One evening, she did not return home all night. When she returned home the next day, Tang asked where she had been. She claimed to have stayed at a sister's place. Because of this, the two argued and quarreled. Chen left in anger and never returned. Tang became increasingly resentful and despaired of life. He locked himself in the bedroom and committed suicide by hanging. It wasn't until the day before yesterday when Li, the second landlord, noticed that there was no sound coming from the room and the door was still locked. She became suspicious and peeked through the crack in the door, where she caught a glimpse of Tang already hanging. He had been dead for three or four days. She immediately reported it to the Xinzha Patrol Station. Detective Ye Yushan was ordered to investigate. The door was forced open, and Tang's body was taken down. A suicide note was found near his body, which briefly described the reasons for his suicide. The detective then transported the body to the Feilun Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Diao Chengtang from the First Special District District Court arrived at the mortuary to conduct an autopsy. Chen Meiyu testified that she had known the deceased for three years and had been in a relationship for a year. A week ago, a companion sister's family had an affair to return home, so he ordered me to accompany him for a night. The next day when he returned home, the deceased beat and scolded me because of this, so I went to my sister's place in extreme anger. I am now willing to claim the body. Hua Li, the second landlord, testified that she was thirty years old, from Suzhou, and was the second landlord of the house. They moved in last December. She usually saw the deceased doing laundry and cooking. In the past four or five days, she had not seen either of them. So, at around 10 a.m., she went to take a peek and saw that the door was still tightly closed. She was horrified to see Tang hanging through the crack in the door and reported it to the patrol station. She had not heard anything about their quarrels. Detective Ye Yushan reported the previous circumstances. Mr. Diao then ruled that Tang Guanlin had died by suicide by hanging and ordered that the body be handed over to Chen Meiyu, who had made arrangements for the coffin and burial.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, since the Dongjiadu Ferry in the South was transferred to the Xingye Trust Society, the ferry workers there feared losing their livelihoods and rose up in protest. They demanded that the workers be allowed to provide their own ferries. Yesterday, the workers sent representatives in groups to petition various Party and government agencies. The first group, led by Zhao Shunxiang, Zhang Xingliang, Ji Gedu, Chen Jinbiao, and more than thirty other representatives, went to the Municipal Government, Public Utilities Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Party Headquarters, and General Labor Union. At the Municipal Government, Section Member Zhu received them and acknowledged that the workers' situation was reasonable. However, the Municipal Government had already approved the transfer to the Xingye Trust Society, so the authority already belonged to the society. The workers then detailed their previous requests for improvements, which had not been approved. Section Member Zhu agreed to forward the matter to the Mayor for review. At the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Gang met with them on behalf of the director, stating that the case was very important as it concerned unemployment and agreed to forward it to the director for discussion at a bureau meeting. The second group, led by Zhang Zhenliang, went to the Municipal Party Headquarters and Public Utilities Bureau. At the Municipal Party Headquarters, Li Weixiong from the Civil Training Section received them and agreed to convey their message. At the Public Utilities Bureau, Shipping Director Song and Mr. Chen Pengzhan received them, acknowledging the need to protect the workers' livelihoods. Regarding the society's encroachment on the original ferry workers' wharves, they accepted the suggestion and agreed to report to the director for instructions. The petitioning group then went to the General Labor Union to request assistance. Standing Committee Member Ye Xianggao received them and expressed his sincere willingness to provide strong assistance. The workers were satisfied and returned to their respective stations.</p>

According to their report, on the 11th of this month, they investigated Pujilu, with twelve police officers from the local Public Security Bureau police station as guides. They found 243 extremely poor households, consisting of 743 adults and 518 children. There were also about 200 households of disaster victims who fled after the disaster, making it impossible to verify and issue tickets. The Jingjianglu investigation was conducted on the 12th, with the support of Officer Ouyang Liu from the Fourth District Police Station on Zhongxing Road, who instructed Police Chief Chen Junmaoxiu and a police officer as guides. They found 572 extremely poor households, consisting of 1,687 adults and 1,090 children, which was generally consistent with the list of major disaster households compiled by the Fourth District Police Station. They immediately issued soup relief tickets. It was reported that the two charity groups jointly distributed soup at the Jiyang Bridge soup distribution station on Liuying Road, Zhabei, at 7 a.m. yesterday morning, allowing the disaster victims to feed themselves and temporarily address their immediate needs, as they seek to find a place to settle down.</p>

<p>Water Supply Resumed After Negotiations</p>
<p>It is reported that Tonghaili, Tongzhou Road, in the city, had a previous water outage due to the landlord's unsuccessful attempt to raise rents. The issue was resolved when the tenants of the neighborhood united to protest against the landlord. It has now been learned that the landlord is now requiring residents to pay an additional two yuan per month for water fees. Since rents in neighboring neighborhoods are cheaper, and the water fee is borne by the landlord, residents are refusing to pay. The water supply was cut off again at 10 am yesterday, but was reopened after negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Coal Industry Association Petitions for Strict Handling of Coal Robberies on the Huangpu River <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Coal Industry Association submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and Public Security Bureau yesterday stating that robberies of coal by armed bandits have occurred on the Huangpu River. The petition requested a thorough investigation and strict handling of the matter. According to a letter from the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association, members have reported that a company calling itself the Huangpu River Cargo Protection Company has been gathering hooligans, preparing weapons, and extorting exorbitant insurance fees from coal ships. They threaten to rob coal and commit violence if they are not satisfied, causing extreme anxiety. From the 16th Pier to the Longhua Cement Plant, bandits frequently appear and wreak havoc at night. The association, in addition to reporting to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation, specifically requests a unified and thorough investigation. According to a letter from member Yitaixing Coal Company, on the afternoon of March 10th at 7 p.m., the No. 5881 barge hired by their company from the Zhu Ceji Barge Company, loaded with 13 tons of coal, was at the Beizhan Wharf in Dongjiadu when more than a dozen robbers suddenly arrived in a sampan, armed with guns, iron bars, and other weapons, and stole about two tons of coal. The bandits told the Zhu Ce's loading staff that for coal transported from Gaochang Temple to the 16th Pier, both east and west of the Huangpu River, an insurance fee of five cents per ton must be paid, otherwise there would be consequences. The robbery on the 10th must have been committed by those gangs. They requested an investigation. According to a letter from member Yuanxing Coal Company, 80 tons of coal delivered to the Yu Qingji Barge Company on the 9th were loaded onto the Shunfu ship of the Dakang Shipping Company at the Yunnong Floating Pontoon in Nanshi. However, three tons of coal were stolen by hooligans in the vicinity. They requested an investigation. The association stated that the above reports concern armed bandits robbing on the Huangpu River, which not only harms merchants and civilians, but also disrupts local security. The case is serious and cannot be tolerated. They humbly request the government to investigate and strictly handle the matter in accordance with the law, in order to eradicate the bandit threat and secure merchants and civilians.</p>
<p>Another petition from the Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association to the Party and government agencies for strict handling was similar in wording (omitted).</p>

<h3 id="e175">Shanghai Commercial News: Zhang Jiping's Appeal Case Heard Yesterday <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Arguments Concluded, Sentence Scheduled for the 20th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial News previously published news of the Xu case, and Ji Juemi sued it for defamation. The First Special District Court initially sentenced Zhang Jiping, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, to four months in prison. Zhang, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired three lawyers, Wang Youling, Jiang Chiping, and Tang Hao, to file an appeal with the same court. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the appeal was heard. Zhang Jiping, accompanied by lawyer Wang Youling, was present on time. Ji Juemi did not attend but was represented by Cao Shulin and Hu Zhenzhi. Presiding Judge Qian Hongye opened the joint panel for the hearing. Appellant Zhang Jiping stated the grounds for the appeal, briefly stating that news reporters are in a third-party position and have no likes or dislikes regarding news reports. The news in this case was published based on incoming submissions, and he, Zhang, had no prior acquaintance or grievances with Ji Juemi, further proving there was no intention to defame. The initial trial's conviction of intentional defamation was inappropriate and should be overturned.</p>
<p>The presiding judge began discussing the facts of the case and initiated arguments. Lawyers Jiang Chiping, Tang Hao, and Wang Youling successively stood and argued that the appellant had an established practice and no malicious intent. Since there was no explicit provision in the Publication Law, and even under criminal law, it was insufficient to constitute a crime. Criminal intent should be considered based on the motive, environment, and consequences. The appellant's motive was open and honest, the environment provided stimulus, and the result did not harm the plaintiff. They requested a verdict of not guilty based on favorable considerations. Subsequently, the plaintiff's representatives, lawyers Cao and Hu, presented their arguments. The court declared the arguments concluded and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>Reading Questions and Answers</p>
<h3 id="e185">Discussion on Reading Methodology (3) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>On the 12th, a letter from Mr. Wang in this column prompted us to raise a discussion on reading methodology. On the 13th, the editor gave a general introduction, raising three key points. Today, we will discuss the methodology in more detail. -Editor</p>
<p>This is indeed a very difficult question. Moreover, many people oppose the idea of finding a specific method before reading. For example, Mr. Lin Yutang advocates casual reading, without overly strict rules. Of course, Mr. Lin's lofty ideas are aimed at addressing the drawbacks of the American-style teaching methods that are currently popular in China. We also agree to some extent, but Mr. Lin's views are ultimately a "genius" theory of reading, which is not applicable to ordinary people. Other scholars generally have their own methods. For example, Zen Buddhist disciples travel around, visiting many famous mountains and rivers. Although they may not gain anything concrete from their masters, their own experiences are substantial. They integrate and understand on their own. Although this is also a method, it is uneconomical and cannot be expected of ordinary hardworking people. If we speak in terms of the times, it is not very scientific.</p>
<p>So, what are the so-called scientific methodologies that we can adopt?</p>
<p>We will now put forward several key points for discussion.</p>
<p>First, after we have acquired basic knowledge, for example, someone like Mr. Wang, it is still necessary to continue reading, but not aimless reading for the sake of reading. Rather, it is to study with a specific practical problem as the center, and books are just some materials and opinions for reference. The issue involved here is that you should first grasp the center of the research. Taking practical needs as the starting point of the research is not playing with abstract theories, but rather applying the discovered principles to practice while enriching, nurturing, growing, and unfolding these theories in practice. Theory and practice are inseparably combined and unified into a whole.</p>
<p>For example, a person who studies currency or finance issues should first learn the abstract basic theory. However, a more advanced researcher should not only seek satisfaction in many books on currency or finance issues. He must use the current problems, such as the current silver problem, as the main body of the research, and then browse books on this subject. In this way, the research results you obtain will not only be very practical, but also naturally closer to the truth. The interest in research is also much stronger than simply reading abstract books.</p>
<p>Second, to do the above item completely well, we must also pay attention to a "correlation" effect that cannot be ignored in research. That is to say, taking the above example, the study of the silver problem cannot be limited to only the monetary aspect of minted silver coins or the aspect of producing silver ore. We also cannot only pay attention to the fiscal policy of a certain country or a certain international agreement. We also cannot only seek solutions from the past currency system and the history of silver. If we study today's silver problem from the perspective of the world's population, we should first not ignore the current relations of production and the capital system, as well as the current state of the world economy. We should understand the countermeasures to the economic panic and the general living conditions of the masses under this policy in connection with these issues. Then, the books that a researcher has to read are not limited to those on currency. There are books that need to be read carefully, or only browsed, or look at the table of contents, and copy statistics, truly many and many, and they are all so closely related. Without this kind of relationship, you will go to a narrow area that is far away from the truth. Therefore, although this item comes after the previous item, it is still very important.</p>
<p>Third, knowing the correlation in research is not enough. How should you absorb this diverse knowledge? Even if you spend your entire life's efforts, you may not be able to finish reading the books on a certain issue in the modern publishing world. How do you deal with this difficult problem? The main thing is that you should make a correct assessment of these many materials, calmly observe the various viewpoints of different positions, compare each other, and make careful reading of this vast amount of books and newspapers. Browse, copy, clip, underline, and classify, etc. Then, you are not afraid of too much material. As long as you handle it properly, you can approach various subjects with the most economical time. Not only will you not be blinded by books, these materials will also be in your mind and at your fingertips.</p>
<p>Fourth, do not be too ambitious about a kind of research. You must know that the progress of knowledge has a certain course. The most important thing to pay attention to when reading is the process of reading. We can only complete a certain kind of research with a certain level of learning. You must not try to be clever. "English in 100 Days" does not really mean that you can "speak" English. It teaches you to learn a bit of pidgin English. Learning it can only make you a Western servant. Therefore, the increase of knowledge and a certain kind of researcher should have a certain process. For example, before writing a history of currency, researching the original theory, collecting materials, reading books, reading newspapers, listening to the radio, listening to lectures, visiting antique displays, visiting archaeologists, and traveling to various places are all part of the process. Not only unfolding the fragments of time that are carefully written is the completion of this work. This point should be especially noted for people with shallower academic qualifications. You should not act rashly and produce immature things that are harmful to others. At the same time, you should also know a little about the difficulties of learning, and this difficulty is necessary in the process, so you can continue to do it without being discouraged. In the aspect of reading, difficulties are always overcome step by step, as long as you follow a certain path, in an orderly and gradual manner.</p>
<p>Fifth, you should eliminate unnecessary things from your mind. For example, in a tragic marriage, there should be no "dragon and phoenix wedding cakes" appearing on the stage. If you are focused on a certain kind of research, you should discard all unnecessary things except for those related to it. Conan Doyle said that he did not mix anything in his brain except for knowledge related to detectives. The biggest enlightenment I have gained from reading the Sherlock Holmes detective case is this sentence in the preface of a certain volume. This is the key to the success of his novels, and it is also the key to the success of all learning.</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss in detail various technical aspects of the reading process one by one. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Liu Changchun runs 100 meters in 10.9 seconds</p>
<p>Other results pale after the rain</p>
<p>(Letter from Wuxi) The Shanghai Bai Hong Track and Field Team, with twenty-two members, arrived in Wuxi on the 10th and stayed at the Railway Hotel. They were hosted by Xue Huidong and others from the local sports community. Liu Changchun, a famous sprinter, was also invited to stay in Wuxi and join the Wuxi team. It was originally scheduled to hold a competition on the 12th, but unfortunately, the weather was bad. It rained heavily all day, and the wind was howling, so the competition could not be held. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that Bai Hong team members Fu Baolu and others, as well as Mr. Liu Changchun, originally planned to return to Shanghai immediately. However, after Mr. Xue Huidong repeatedly persuaded them to stay, they finally agreed to stay for one more day. On the morning of the 12th, the rain stopped, but there was no sunlight. All the team members were happy and prepared to compete at places like Lüqiu. At 12 o'clock, they took rickshaws directly to the playground of the Provincial People's Education Institute in Sheqiao. At 12:30, they gathered for a photo. At 12:45, the flag was raised and the opening ceremony was held. At 1 o'clock, the competition officially began. There were thousands of spectators in the audience. The results of the competition are as follows:</p>

<p>Implementing Rural Improvement: Fujian Union College Establishes Rural Service Department</p>
<p>Researching Rural Revival Plans and Cultivating Rural Work Talents</p>
<p>(Fuzhou Correspondence) The private Fujian Union College is one of the highest institutions of learning in Fujian Province. It has been established for nearly twenty years and has a good reputation. The school is located in the scenic and well-known Shigu Mountain in Min, surrounded by villages. Therefore, it has always paid close attention to rural service and rural issues. In the past six or seven years, the college has used its internal scientific equipment to actively engage in agricultural experiment work, such as grain selection, silkworm improvement, crop pest research, fruit tree cultivation, beekeeping, chicken farming, and frog farming, all of which have achieved considerable results. These results have been introduced to the villagers and have been well-received and beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Recently Established a Special Department <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the college, alarmed by the increasing frequency of rural bankruptcy and the deepening economic panic in the country, established a Rural Service Department to make a practical contribution. Special funds have been allocated to actively implement rural services, plan expenses, and concentrate talent to prepare for improving rural undertakings.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Initial Plans Formulated <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The initial plans of the Rural Service Department have recently been roughly formulated and divided into two major categories. The first is "Analysis of Rural Needs in this Province": A. Research on rural production issues; B. Research on rural economic issues; C. Research on social life improvement issues. The second is "Measures to Meet Rural Needs": A. Conducting specialized research and special service work; B. Implementing experiments and building a central rural service extension area; C. Training rural service personnel; D. Extension work.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Guidance of Internal Courses <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>To guide the work of the Rural Service Department, the college has established two courses in the Economics and Education Departments: "Rural Cooperation" and "Rural Service Methods." The former focuses on the practical methods of rural cooperation and differs from general lectures that only focus on theory and ignore practical application. The latter trains a group of students to study in classrooms at the college and to go to nearby villages to lead the children in the villages to experience a group life, so that theory and experience can advance hand in hand, and the effectiveness of the work will definitely be doubled.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Experts Responsible for Guidance <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Rural Service Department, the college has hired Chen Xicheng, an alumnus of the college, to return to the college to preside over the work. Mr. Chen has a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in the United States and has specialized in rural economics for many years. After graduation, he traveled around the world to investigate the state of rural economies. He once went to Denmark to study rural cooperation and has special insights. Mr. Chen has now arrived at the college to take up his post.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Soliciting Cooperative Organizations <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The college believes that rural revitalization is a major issue related to national economy and people's livelihood, and the procedures are complicated. It cannot be shouldered by one school alone. Recently, President Lin Jingrun has separately invited agricultural experts at home and abroad and enthusiastic social service personnel to cooperate, so that this experiment can proceed smoothly. If it is successful in the future, it may be a great event for national rejuvenation.</p>
<h3 id="e209">News on the Termination and Reorganization of the Film Censorship Committee <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The issue of film censorship in China was initially proposed by the Ministry of Interior, which wanted to refer to the Japanese method of film censorship, which was carried out by the Tokyo Police Department, so that the Ministry of Interior would carry out the censorship, because the Ministry of Interior has a Police Department, which can preside over everything. Later, the Ministry of Education also proposed that film censorship is related to social education. As a result, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education jointly organized the Film Censorship Committee, and the two ministries jointly sent seven members to serve concurrently in censorship matters. The Central Party Headquarters also sent three instructors to work on film censorship. The Censorship Committee was attached to the Ministry of Education, and the members continued to receive their original positions and salaries from their respective ministries. The Censorship Committee subsidized each member with 30 yuan for travel expenses. In addition to their duties in the ministry, the members would reduce their duties in the ministry during film censorship. After the proposal to change the members of the committee to full-time and to change the organization, the committee is now affiliated with the Film Industry Guidance Committee of the Central Propaganda Committee (the Guidance Committee is divided into two committees: one is the Film Script Review Committee, and the other is the Film Censorship Committee). After the reorganization, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education no longer officially send members to participate. The Film Industry Guidance Committee has now hired Luo Gang, Dai Ce, and others as members of the Censorship Committee, with Luo as the director. All the film censorship committees jointly organized by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education will be terminated upon receipt of the order from the Executive Yuan. However, the financial accounts for the past year have not yet been prepared and reported to the Audit Department (in addition to the members, the committee has more than ten administrative staff and is also an affiliated institution). It has been approved to allow two months to complete the accounting. However, film censorship will be handled by the reorganized Censorship Committee around the middle of this month. The film censorship venue on the upper floor of the auditorium of the Ministry of Education is said to be temporarily lent to the reorganized Censorship Committee for three weeks.</p>

<p>The Anhui Provincial Government recently approved the regulations for the Academic Property Reorganization Committee and the Education Expenditure Committee and plans to establish the two agencies immediately. It is reported that the provincial government has appointed Wu Tianheng as the secretary of the Academic Property Reorganization Committee and Jin Jiechen as the secretary of the Education Expenditure Committee and issued the seals of the two agencies. The original Education Expenditure Management Office has been reduced in scope and is subordinate to the Education Expenditure Committee, and the position of director is still held by the former director, Cheng Bin.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Secondary Education in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Qian Jiazhi, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, reported to the provincial government on the secondary education in the province in the past six months, stating that Director Chen reported on the situation of county and city education in the province in the past six months, focusing on qualitative improvement and quantitative advancement. The report on secondary education in the province in the past six months also follows this and describes the plans and improvement methods in two parts.</p>
<p>(1) Plan to Promote Teacher Education and Vocational Education</p>
<p>Affected by the shortage of education funds in the province in recent years, the number of secondary schools has not been expanded as much as possible, and the regulations of the Ministry of Education to reduce ordinary middle schools and establish vocational schools and normal schools have been followed. Therefore, in the future, the department will handle secondary education and adhere to this policy to suit the province's advancement plan. A. Plan to Promote Normal Education: Normal education in the province has been operating for nearly thirty years, and it was once very prosperous, with many talents emerging. Later, due to frequent changes in the education system and laws, mergers and reorganizations gradually reduced the number of normal schools. In the 20th year of the Republic, there were only 1,823 normal school students. After reorganization in the 21st year, the number increased to 2,420. In the 22nd year, the department, according to the current distribution and needs of teacher training institutions, made a multi-year advancement plan, dividing the 76 counties and cities in the province into four regions according to the old routes. Although there is no independently established normal school in the Jinhua region, the provincial Jinhua Middle School still has a senior high school normal department, which has always recruited one class. This year, it was ordered to recruit one more class. As for the Qiantang and Kuaiji regions, there are independent normal schools, but the provincial teacher training institution in the Ouhai region is still vacant. Therefore, a provincial Wenzhou Normal School was added in Zhenglou, Pingyang County. The county or joint normal training institutions were also increased or reorganized as needed. A total of ten have been approved successively. B. Plan to Promote Vocational Education: The department believes that the effectiveness of vocational education has been rare in recent years, and the most important reason is that vocational education cannot adapt to social needs. Therefore, students have no way out, and vocational education gradually becomes rigid. Now, in order to actively promote vocational education, we will examine the needs of the province in detail, establish goals, and use them as the basis for the annual advancement of vocational education. The vocational schools needed in the province must be increased as much as possible. However, vocational schools focus on equipment and practice places. The province's education funds are insufficient, and it is impossible to enrich the quantity and quality at the same time. Now, in this year, based on the principle that agricultural education is the most important in the province, we will first establish an experimental agricultural school in Tangya, Jinhua County, to cultivate agricultural talents who use both hands and brains and actually operate with an experimental spirit. In addition, in recent years, the province has actively reorganized the field tax and miscellaneous taxes and improved the accounting system, and there are also a large number of financial assistants needed. Therefore, a financial specialization class was attached to the commercial department of the provincial Hangzhou Senior High School to meet the needs of the society. In addition, in recent years, the province has been clearing land, building highways, and gradually organizing them, and there is a great need for replacement personnel with simple academic skills in civil engineering. Therefore, a senior civil engineering vocational class was attached to the provincial Jiaxing Junior High School. As for how to follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education in the future, the percentage standard for the establishment of secondary schools has been approved by Director Chen according to the situation in the province. We will train and reorganize secondary education, maintain the status quo, actively expand teacher training and vocational education, raise funds, increase the number of schools, and set a four-year advancement plan to achieve the goal of completing the standard by the 26th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>(2) Measures to Improve Secondary Education</p>
<p>Secondary education is an important process in students' education. We will describe the assessment of teachers and students in two parts. A. Regarding faculty and staff, in the 22nd year of the Republic, the province revised the Interim Regulations on the Administrative Organization of Secondary Schools in the Province and the Interim Regulations on the Appointment, Dismissal, and Treatment of Principals and Teachers of Secondary Schools in the Province in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education on secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. On the one hand, we will slightly limit the number of secondary school staff to regulate expenses, and on the other hand, we will improve the qualifications of secondary school teachers to increase teaching efficiency. At present, in addition to promulgating the Interim Measures for Reviewing the Qualifications of Secondary School Teachers, we are drafting measures for secondary school teachers to pursue further studies so that teachers in each school can improve their academic discussions and keep up with the times. B. Regarding students, the most important thing implemented in the past six months is (1) fulfilling the secondary school graduation examination, (2) promulgating the plan to guide the thinking of students in secondary schools, and (3) producing and distributing the skill test form for students in secondary schools above the secondary level in Zhejiang Province. If the above assessment of teachers and students can be maintained, the improvement of secondary education in the province will be effective.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Ordered to Notify All Middle Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all public and registered private high schools in the city yesterday, stating, "According to the order No. 2296 of the Ministry of Education, it is approved by the Training Supervisory Department to investigate the progress of national military education. According to local regulations, the ministry should send personnel from time to time to review the implementation and provide necessary instructions. Personnel have been sent to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for on-site inspections, but due to factual obstacles in other provinces and cities, they have not been held. Now that the situation in various places is tending to stabilize and traffic is unobstructed, on-site inspection of national military training in various provinces and cities should be carried out in accordance with regulations to observe results and promote improvement. The ministry has appointed Pan Youqiang, director of the National Military Education Department of the ministry, to depart for Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Jiangsu to inspect military education in high schools and above and to investigate the situation of local armies and the organization of the masses.

<p>In order to improve education in the province, the Shandong Provincial Education Department has specially sent Sun Fei, Xu Yiqian, Chen Jianheng, and Dong Weichuan, four people who have a good reputation in the education community, to Europe to study the administrative system, facilities, and management of mass, primary, and social education in order to improve education. Sun and others arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of this month and have been busy with applying for passports, preparing luggage, and contacting the consulate to exchange foreign currency in recent days. It is scheduled to take the ship today to Italy and then to Switzerland, France, Belgium, England, Denmark, Germany, Turkey, Poland, Persia, and Russia. Yesterday, socialite Huang Jingjun specially held a farewell party for them at Liuheju, Baxianqiao. Those who accompanied him included Cui Cen from the Central Bank, Huang Chaoyi, a reporter from Guowen News Agency, and more than 20 others. Mr. Chen told reporters that the establishment of schools was originally to cultivate talents. Although primary school is the foundation of education, middle school is the foundation for cultivating leading talents. At present, the management of middle schools is not strict enough. In order to improve, we must pay more attention to production education so that learning is life and to avoid the suffering of batches of graduates entering society and still feeling unable to make a living. Chinese education is its own business and should find its own way out because a country has its own historical environment and national character as its background. It is not applicable to move the whole thing to China. This time I was ordered to study, and I have decided on two goals: not to superficially study systems without a system, but to examine the occurrence of the system, analyze it as a comparison, and seek improvement. I am willing to report my findings to you at any time and hope to be instructed. Around 6 pm, they went to the Xinguang Wharf. More than 30 people sent them off, including Hu Bozhou from Shen Bao, Gao Zhongyu from the Power Company, and Li Shengwu and Tao Zhihang from the Commercial Press. It is also reported that Xu Shaodi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, and Gong Dongli, Xue Kuiguang, Chen Qingjia, and others sent to study naval forces in Italy by the principal of Peishan School on Sumatra Island in the Netherlands and the Ministry of the Navy, and all the staff of the Hangzhou Provincial Party Department sent them off.</p>

<h3 id="e225">The Jaws of the Tiger <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Wofo</p>
<p>"The road is like the tiger's mouth; you must not walk in the middle." Indeed, one cannot help but be grateful for the kindness of the admonishers. Automobiles, moreover, countless automobiles, simultaneously flash their two great eyes, filled with a terrifying light, picking out people to devour, weaving together like chasing the wind and electricity. At this moment, you, standing in the jaws of the tiger, if you feel a sudden darkness before your eyes due to carelessness or haste, your heart in a panic, then, in just an instant, the scarlet blood that was originally obediently circulating in the blood vessels around your body, without even being chewed by the tiger's mouth, will stain the wheels, stain the road, and be seen by those in the cars, the drivers, and passersby as peach blossoms in March.</p>
<p>"The road is like the tiger's mouth" is not lying at all. Perhaps its—the automobile's—appetite for eating people is even fiercer than that of a real tiger. Therefore, "you must not walk in the middle," how firmly should you remember this! Remember it until you leave the "tiger's mouth."</p>
<p>But, taking Shanghai as an example... are "roads" the only "tiger's mouths" that are open and waiting to eat people? Having avoided the tiger's mouth of the road, is there no possibility of falling into other "tiger's mouths" again? Frankly speaking... in Shanghai, in addition to "roads," the "tiger's mouths" are simply countless.</p>
<p>All places of intoxication, all places of comfort, all flirtatious glances, fleshy legs, everything... everywhere there is such a "tiger's mouth" open and waiting to eat people. However, the tiger's mouth of the road is tangible, while all these "tiger's mouths" are comparatively intangible. Yet, precisely because they are intangible, you are less likely to feel the terror of the tiger's mouth of the road, be wary, and avoid them in advance. Perhaps not only will you not feel terror, be wary, and avoid them in advance, but you will also think it is very necessary to send your body, life, plus your parents, wife, family property, and career, all together, voluntarily, and sincerely into all these "tiger's mouths." Also, precisely because they are intangible, when you fall into the tiger's mouth of the road, you can still see your scarlet blood staining the wheels, staining the road... but when you fall into all these "tiger's mouths," not even a drop or strand of blood will fly out of that "tiger's mouth," because your entire body has been annihilated. Shanghai "tiger's mouths," are they only "roads"? Having avoided the tiger's mouth of the road, is there no possibility of falling into other "tiger's mouths" again? Yet, people only see the "tiger's mouth" of the road, but never see the other "tiger's mouths." Admonishers also only warn of the "tiger's mouth" of the road, but do not warn of the other "tiger's mouths."</p>
<p>Therefore, people's destination ultimately cannot escape the "tiger's mouth."</p>
<h3 id="e226">Research on Inkstones (II) <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wuliao Ke</p>
<p>(1) The reason for loving inkstones lies in their practicality.</p>
<p>The origin of inkstones is very ancient. It is well known that the Yellow Emperor used jade as an inkstone, and Emperor Hongshi created the ink sea. The Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital also says that the emperor used jade as an inkstone and wine as a drop, taking it to be non-freezing. Therefore, in later generations, there was still the circulation of yellow jade inkstones and black jade inkstones. In addition to the emperor using jade, other officials and civilians seemed to be able to choose inkstone materials at will, so there were also various types of crystal inkstones, iron inkstones, copper inkstones, magnetic inkstones, and bamboo inkstones. After the Qin and Han dynasties, those who used inkstones began to study inkstone materials and recognized various mountain stones as suitable for practical use. At that time, after many people's tests, the most suitable mountain stones that were confirmed included the Yanzhi stone from Beijing's Meishan Mountain, the Huizhou She stone from Jiangnan, the Lingyan Wu Village stone from Suzhou, the Kaihua black stone from Quzhou, Zhejiang, the Datuo stone from Guizhou in Huguang, the Yuanzhou black stone, the Zhizhou Changde Jianxi stone, the Zijin stone from Shandong, the Hongsi stone from Qingzhou, the Ji Island stone from Dengzhou, the Jiao stone from Jiangzhou, Shanxi, the Lintao Fuhe green stone from Shaanxi, the Zhaoqing Duanxi stone from Guangdong, the Jinxing stone from Qiongzhou, and the Chen Ni inkstone from Guo Prefecture and the Guwa inkstone from Xiang Prefecture (the above stones' properties are all explained in Shi Lianshui and Tang Bingjun's Records of the Four Treasures of the Study). In addition, there are many who use other stones as inkstones, but none are as famous as the above. During the Tang and Song dynasties, the country was peaceful and well-governed, and culture became more advanced. The study of inkstone stones became more meticulous. Among the above inkstone materials, the Duan stone from Zhaoqing, the She stone from Huizhou, and the Chen Ni stone from Guo Prefecture were recognized as particularly suitable. From then on, the three types of Duan, She, and Chen became popular in the world. At that time, the Tao River Tao green inkstone and the Hongsi inkstone from Qingzhou were both regarded as rare and famous stones in the world. However, because they were produced in small quantities and difficult to mine, they were rarely circulated. The Japanese still love them and strive to collect them, but it is said that they are absolutely impossible to obtain.</p>
<p>Among these three types of Duan, She, and Chen, by the Ming and Qing dynasties, Duan gradually became the only one that was valued, because Duan stone was more suitable for practical use than She and Chen. Why is Duan stone suitable for practical use? It is fine, delicate, firm, and moist, does not harm the brush, does not dry easily, and the ink ground on it is finer than on other inkstones, grinding ink quickly and developing ink well. As for the difference between grinding ink quickly and developing ink well, Ji Shouqiao of Xiushui said in his Study of Duanxi Inkstones that Duke Mi Zhao and others all said that the wonder of developing ink is like lacquer and oil. It is also said that the stone from the lower rock develops ink as smoothly as boiling pan and sticking wax. Su Dongpo said, "The beauty of an inkstone lies only in its smoothness and ability to develop ink." Cai Junmo's discussion is especially clear and distinct, directly saying that developing ink is not easy to grind. The ink in the inkstone shines brightly, rotating with the brush, and when washed, it dissolves completely. It is because the stone is firm and moist and can develop it without sticking to the inkstone. Therefore, those who know consider easy grinding to be grinding ink quickly, and ink like oil to be developing ink. The best of the water pit can combine both, but it is wrong to consider easy grinding to be developing ink.</p>
<p>What is called suitable for practical use, its wonderfulness lies entirely in this. Today's inkstone lovers all love water rocks, precisely for this reason. From this, we can also prove my statement that the reason for loving inkstones lies in practicality. Errata: In yesterday's article on Research on Inkstones, in the sentence "天上神仙一句," the word "上" was misprinted as "下." This is specifically corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e227">In a Dream <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The sky that day did not seem to have sunlight. On an unknown street, there were many Boy Scouts strolling idly in twos and threes. Not far from this street, there seemed to be a broad square, like a public sports field. The walls were white, and groups of Boy Scouts were walking in and out of an arched door. This square was their gathering place.</p>
<p>I don't know how, but I was also walking on this street, as if I was escorting my family back to my hometown, passing by this place. As I was walking, I suddenly met her face to face. I still remember very clearly that although her face was fairer than before, she had lost some weight. She didn't seem to see me. I, for some reason, wanted to call out to her, but in the end, I didn't. After we brushed past each other, I turned my head to look at her, and she stopped and called out to me, "Sir." Then, she said, "Please come with me."</p>
<p>We walked to the front of a house. The doorway was very narrow, and she went in. I don't know why, but I didn't follow her in; I just stood outside the door. Ah! The bugle suddenly sounded loudly, and she hurriedly came out. I said, "This is the order to assemble; you should go quickly."</p>
<p>I watched her go, feeling deeply disappointed. I still remember very clearly that the clothes she was wearing were still that light-colored liberty cloth shirt.</p>

<p>— Mingyi</p>
<p>The Red Route 7 bus coming out of Xujiahui was packed with students from × school. Apart from the glittering heads and feet, there were also very smart Western suits. Coincidentally, the seats in the bus were just full. The bus started, and they also began to talk about ways to spend this Sunday. "Let's go to the Cathay to see Barrymore!" "No, let's get a haircut first." "I heard that business at the Balunmen Dance Hall is not bad. If we go later, there might be surprises." Due to the disagreement of opinions, no good result was achieved in the short time.</p>
<p>The fast bus kept shortening its route. One stop after another was passed. At the intersection of Haig Road and Yidingpan Road, the bus stopped. A fashionable young lady got on. She had a healthy and beautiful physique, full of the majesty of a virgin, lively, with dimpled smiles. She was truly worthy of being the school belle of × school.</p>
<p>The bus continued to speed forward as if flying. One stop after another was passed, the red Jing'an Temple, the yellow post office. At the last stop, the true face of the metropolis was seen again, beautiful concubines, drawing eyebrows, applying powder, fully expressing vanity and extravagance. Enjoy today while you have wine, for tomorrow you may be drunk. Alas! In the great universe, there is originally only one "happiness" that is worth cherishing. The bus stopped. One by one, people emerged from the carriage with smiles, and of course, not a little bit of shy blush appeared on her lively and charming face.</p>
<p>Correction: In the article "Wang Jingwei's Obsession with Eating Chicks" published in this journal the day before yesterday, it was said that Jiang ate three chicks in one meal and killed three to four thousand chicks a year, etc. The author's words were too extreme and did not reflect the facts. It should be corrected immediately.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p>
<p>Tearful Faces See People Off to Distant Garrisons, Wind and Sand Pervade the Night, Leaving the Fortress, Stationing in a Lonely City</p>
<p>Secondly, it just so happens that the northeast wind is blowing tonight. People just have to walk against the wind, and that will be heading northeast, there will be no mistake. However, the road underfoot is not necessarily heading directly northeast, so after walking a short distance, one has to stop and consider for a moment. Moreover, a battalion of people forming four lines, when stretched out, is quite long, and it is not easy to see each other from front to back. Although each company has white flags held up as contact markers, the night is too dark, and it is not clear. In addition, the wind outside the pass, squeezed out of the mountain valleys, is particularly strong, blowing people's hair back and making it impossible to lift their heads. After walking for two or three hours, they had not even covered twenty miles, and everyone was exhausted. They had no choice but to grope for a while and rest for a while. Later, they managed to grope their way to a large grove of trees, which offered some shelter from the wind. They announced a rest at the foot of the grove on the hillside. All that could be heard was the wind blowing through the treetops, the wind rushing in with a "whoosh," the branches sweeping back with a "swish." Although it was not as fierce as the artillery fire on the battlefield, it was even more tragic and fierce than the artillery fire on the battlefield. Everyone sat with their guns propped up on the dark hillside. It was the waning moon, about three hours after midnight. The night gradually brightened. Although the wind and sand in the air were still heavy, the scenery in front of them could slowly be seen clearly. At the same time, they discovered a road running through the middle of two mountain peaks, curving past. If this were military marching in wartime, this would be the easiest place to be ambushed, and it was impossible to stay. The four company commanders could not help but sweat in their hearts. Shi Fang stood up, looked around, checked his luminous wristwatch, and ordered them to continue marching. The soldiers struggled forward against the wind and sand, not knowing what the mission was. Everyone guessed that it was fighting, but they also did not see it as a peaceful task. They had no choice but to keep a riddle in their hearts and walk along in a daze. (335)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e230">Buying an Umbrella <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>At the western end of the new market, a moat-like small river cleverly displays a bit of its role as a boundary. The river is very narrow, but a rather wide plank bridge is built over it. From here, you can go to the West City, or you can take a turn and take a shortcut to the South City. This is the road I have to travel back and forth twice a day. The reason is that I am a regular visitor to the new market. If you can't find me in those singing halls every night, that would truly be a miracle.</p>
<p>Initially, near this riverbank, there were only one or two bird shops and a small wine shop. In front of the wooden bridge, there was a bit of a commercial appearance. At night, the light of just one electric lamp often made me worry about whether I would fall into the river when taking a rickshaw across the bridge. But soon the place gradually prospered. The number of shops increased from three or two to a dozen. There were tea houses, noodle shops, fortune-telling shops, and even a foreign goods shop with a broadcasting machine. Every day, some scratchy music sounds spread from there, attracting many unhealthy women, filthy children, and anemic, rough laborers.</p>
<p>After a certain appropriate time in the evening, many shops that did not need to do evening business closed their doors and took a break. Only one noodle shop remained open because it had to provide dinner for the rickshaw pullers. The electric light leaking from there was as weak as the light of a candle. Gradually, I saw several women standing side by side in front of the noodle shop. A few pieces of cheap, colorful clothing haphazardly reflected a certain type of human figure that we often see on Fuzhou Road in Shanghai. I didn't observe them closely, but in a hasty glance, some feelings couldn't help but float to my heart... "Ah, there are street prostitutes here too. The influence of Shanghai-style street prostitutes has openly invaded this small city."</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers were accustomed to using these street prostitutes as objects of ridicule. When they dragged guests up the bridge, they often intentionally rudely rubbed past them, or simply charged straight at them. The street prostitutes were forced to retreat and curse. One day, late at night, I finished listening to the opera in the market and took a rickshaw back. Unexpectedly, I encountered a heavy rain. The rickshaw puller's oilskin coat and the oilcloth on the rickshaw both excitedly bounced with raindrops. When passing over this wooden bridge, the street prostitute that I usually saw was the only one lingering there. The large red flower clothes could be seen in the darkness, all stuck together in a mess. The powder on her face was washed away, showing streaks. Many water droplets glistened on her hair. This was a very ugly street prostitute, often the unluckiest loner in that usual line. She slowly walked towards us. When my rickshaw brushed past her, she suddenly stopped and hurriedly cast a heavy arrow of sight over, which was a pair of eyes that did not shine at all, containing much complex sorrow. I did not dare to look her directly in the eyes, and only captured the roughest impression before hurriedly passing by.</p>
<p>The rain continued intermittently for two days and two nights. When returning home from the new market at night, under the oilcloth of the rickshaw, I imagined the miserable street prostitute standing in the rain waiting for business, but I no longer saw her. The light leaking from the noodle shop was still so dim and worried, but in front of the door, there was no one there.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the third day, I saw that street prostitute buying an umbrella in a foreign goods shop on another street. It was daytime, and the weather was clear. The price she paid for the umbrella was eleven coppers for six jiao small foreign coins. She held the umbrella in a very wealthy and leisurely manner and walked out of the shop door, parallel to me. She seemed to have awakened some memory and looked at me deeply, still with a pair of eyes that did not shine at all, but the sorrow was even more complex.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I no longer saw that street prostitute on the market by the river, whether it was sunny or raining. But often I could still see some other street prostitutes walking back and forth under umbrellas in the rain, and I thought of her. She, this street wanderer who experiences all kinds of pain in the human world, had a different fate. She has already gone to another world, perhaps.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Financial Gold Price Slightly Declines by One and a Half Yuan <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>American Proposal to Issue Paper Money and Purchase Silver Meets Weak Performance</p>
<p>Central Bank Opens Spot Market for Over Eight Hundred Bars, Briefly Rising</p>
<p>The gold market slightly rebounded yesterday. Unfavorable foreign news and the Central Bank's opening of the spot market balanced the day's situation. In the morning, overseas silver markets in England and America rose in unison, with silver prices on the London Metal Exchange rising between 3.7 and 5.8 basis points. London's raw gold fell by half a penny, and exchange rates also rose, with American wheat rising by 1.125 points and American cotton rising by 12 pounds. The opening for wool was flat, and although it once rose to three yuan afterward, due to news from the Associated Press that the American government planned to issue paper money to aid wounded soldiers, it weakened slightly. After the opening, prices fluctuated. A Reuters dispatch reported that U.S. Senator Wheeler had proposed a mutual reconciliation plan, leading to a proposal within the U.S. government to purchase 50,000,000 ounces of silver monthly, aiming for a gold-silver ratio of 16 to 1. This news still struggled to maintain prices. Later, banks continued to buy forward U.S. exchange, and the Central Bank opened the spot market for over eight hundred bars (at a price of 4.5 yuan), causing prices to rise temporarily, but they slightly receded at noon. The market sentiment was weaker in the afternoon, and the exchange market seemed looser. Although Bombay saw a decline, rumors of British purchases of silver through private Western telegrams circulated. Market sentiment was sluggish, and prices slightly declined. Refined gold was priced at 55 yuan. The four-five month swap will begin at 3:00 PM on the 15th, marking the first swap after the new standard. There was much speculation on both sides, but the premium was not expected to be too large. The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 942.6 yuan, slightly higher by 1.6 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 2.4 yuan. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 5625, and U.S. exchange at 35.25 yuan. While Zhifeng Yong reached 3.2 yuan, a Reuters dispatch of silver purchases caused Shengda Lai to sell, and Pan Gen and Mitsui to offer six-month U.S. dollars at 6875, causing the price to fall to within 2 yuan. Qian Changxiang and Huixiang Lai bought in, causing it to rise again to above 3 yuan. Shengda and Dadecheng continued to sell, causing it to fall to 1.8 yuan. Anticipating that HSBC would quote British exchange at flat and U.S. exchange up 125, market sentiment stabilized. Qian Changxiang, Daxing Yongheng, Yu Zhaofeng, Chang Shunmao, and others continuously purchased. Macgregor and others even bid up seven-month U.S. dollars to 8125, gradually rising to 4.5 yuan. At this point, banks were keen to buy distant and sell near contracts, and the domestic market was not very tight, so they took advantage of the high prices to supply, causing it to fall back to within 4 yuan. With the Central Bank opening the spot market, Yingfeng Hengfeng bought 420 bars, stabilizing the price. Later, spot houses such as Dadecheng, Taikangrun, Dafeng Heng, Tongfeng Yong all opened the spot market, and players like Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yida Yong, and others scrambled to buy, causing the price to rise to 5.6 yuan. HSBC offered eight-month U.S. dollars at 75, and Hengyu and Shengda sold off, causing it to fall to 3.7 yuan. Qian Changxiang took delivery of bars. The noon closing was 944.1 yuan, and goods were bid at 3.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 943.7 yuan, with goods opening at 3.8 yuan. Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, and Hongli all sold. Seven-month U.S. dollars were difficult to sell at 125. Rumors of British silver purchases caused it to retreat from 4.1 yuan to 2.6 yuan. Macgregor Zhengjin bought seven-month U.S. dollars at 875, stabilizing the price. Later, Bombay reported a drop of six annas. Goods, Yuanchun Dachangxiang, Yuanmao Yong, and others actively bought in, causing it to rise to 4.1 yuan. Yuanchun sold off. Macgregor offered four-month U.S. dollars at 4375, falling back to around 3 yuan. Yida Yong, Zhifeng Yongheng Xing sold again, causing it to fall to 2.1 yuan. Goods were still delivered, and after fluctuating, the closing was 942.5 yuan. After the market closed, goods were difficult to bid at 3 yuan, but Hengxing's supply kept the market weak. The highest price during the day was 945.6 yuan, and the lowest was 941.8 yuan, fluctuating by 3.8 yuan. In the end, it rebounded by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 34.75 yuan due to HSBC Bank's U.S. exchange quote rising by 125, making the standard gold price 95 yuan. In terms of the closing price, the premium was approximately 53 yuan, which was 5 yuan less than the previous close. The settlement price for the March term, with HSBC's shilling unchanged, was still calculated at 705 yuan. In terms of the closing price, the premium was approximately 6 yuan, which was 1 yuan less than before. Account registrations for this month were 700 yuan, and for April, 944 yuan. The morning replenishment was 700 yuan, and in the afternoon, 699 yuan. The price of refined gold was calculated at 955 yuan. There were no transactions in the market, and buying interest from fellow traders was stagnant. It was only heard that Eastern goods were traded at a premium of 11.5 yuan, and Tianjin goods were rolled over by Yingfeng Heng at a premium of 11.5 yuan, making it extremely quiet. The Central Bank opened the spot market quite extensively, with Yingfeng Heng accounting for 420 bars, Taikangrun, Tongfeng Yong, Dafeng Heng each accounting for 105 bars, and Dadecheng accounting for 70 bars, priced at 944.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat. In summary, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengtai, Huixiang, Yongde, Dachangxiang, Tongfu, Hengxing, Yuan Xie, Kangshun, Juyuan, Mao Yuan, Mao Yingfeng Heng, and others were on the buying side. Shengda, Sida, Yuan Mao Yongfu, Yu Yida, Yongxiang and Dadecheng Bingxing, etc., were on the selling side. Yifeng Yongheng Yu Zhifeng Yong Qian Changxiang went forward and came out later, while Heng Chang Yong Dafayong Bingxing Yuanchun came out first and went in later. The Dalian gang Wanxing collectively traded more than 600 bars, rolled in more than 200 bars. Shunli collectively traded nearly 600 bars, rolled in more than 400 bars. The Guangdong gang Hengxing sold more than 300 bars, entered 200 bars, Shengda entered more than 100 bars, and exited more than 300 bars. As of today, the April period chips total 20,986 bars, with a total of 39 long positions and 53 short positions. The number of transactions on the same day was 29,281 in the morning and 12,229 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The March term opened in the morning at 700 yuan, up 2 yuan from the previous close. Xiangfeng sold 84 bars at this price, and Heng Yu sold 35 bars, which were purchased by Yuan Changyong. Yida Yong sold 35 bars to Dadecheng at the same price. Later, Yi Da Yong resold 46 bars to Yuan Changyong, rising to 0.05 yuan. Hongxing sold 42 bars to Yuanmao, retreating to 0.01 yuan, and Dadecheng Shunli did 21 bars against each other, returning to 700 yuan. The noon closing was 700 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon at 700 yuan, and Zhengchang sold 70 bars to Dadecheng. Later, Zhengchang sold 14 bars to Yuan Fengyong at 699.9 yuan, but Zhengchang still had a selling appetite and resold to Fuan at 9.5 yuan. Huiyuan sold to Dadecheng, retreating to 9 yuan. Dadecheng still had more than 200 bars to sell to Hengyu at 9.3 yuan, possibly a clearing transaction. The closing was 699 yuan. The highest price for the day was 700.05 yuan, and the lowest was 699 yuan, a difference of 1.5 yuan. As a result, it rose by 1 yuan compared to the previous close. As of today, the number of March-term chips is 19,362.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Foreign Call Loans Remained Flat Throughout <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>-Settlements Also Stagnant as Before-</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign call loan market remained chaotic with no ups or downs. Both the morning and afternoon markets opened for free loans again. Since the beginning of this year's bull market, there has been no market price, demonstrating the looseness and abundance of funds. The market for overnight loans also opened for free loans every day, mainly because the supply and demand of funds were very relaxed. The trading volume for call loans was over 4.2 million in the morning, with over 300,000 in new transactions, and over 200,000 in the afternoon. Transactions in the small clearinghouse were over 600,000. For bank settlements, foreign banks settled over 2.7 million in bills and over 3.56 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral, and miscellaneous items, with 300,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks settled over 2.56 million in bills and over 4.89 million in various goods, foreign exchange, tax, collateral, and miscellaneous items, with 300,000 in warehouse deposits. Japanese banks settled over 1.7 million in bills and over 3.7 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and miscellaneous items, with over 300,000 in remittances from various routes and 300,000-400,000 in cash receipts.

<h3 id="e234">Jiangsu Copper Coins Rise Another Ten Yuan <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small foreign coins were again in good shape, with the market price rising by 10 yuan compared to the previous day, calculated at 820 yuan. Both the morning and afternoon markets were the same, with transactions made. The morning market was 5,000 jiao, and the afternoon market was 2,000 jiao. Guangdong small foreign coins roughly increased by slightly more than 2 yuan, with the morning market calculated at 762.5 yuan and the afternoon market at 763 yuan. The trading volume was 65,000 jiao in the morning and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins increased by 1,000 wen, to 318,000 wen, with transactions of more than 35,900 strings, calculated at a cost of 11,300 foreign yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Bull and Bear Camps Firmly Established in the Securities and Bond Market <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The meticulous calculation of five-cent movements shows the clarity of the trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange still did not escape the sluggish state. Although the short positions of No. 75 had to swap contracts, the exchange floor was not affected by the futures prices due to their strong price defenses. If the bid price occasionally dropped by five cents, buyers would scramble, and if it occasionally increased by five cents, sellers would eagerly sell. A difference of five cents seemed remarkably valuable. It was heard that many people were selling at the limit price, so the market price could not go up, and the bullish forces were strong and immovable, so there was no trend of falling back. This kind of repeated brewing will inevitably have to wait for changes in the environment, which may not be possible. However, there will be problems with the supply and demand of chips due to the urgent deadlines, and it is impossible to delay again and again. If this continues, the defenses on both sides, once shaken, will cause changes in sentiment. Many people are waiting to move when the time is right. Yesterday's process was roughly the same as on Monday. From morning to night, they were still competing for the lead between five cents and one jiao. Overall, it seemed slightly weaker, but in terms of the results, except for the "Bian Yi" and "19 Shan" futures and the "20 Juan" recent futures, which were slightly better by five cents and one jiao, the rest were only slightly higher or lower by five cents and one jiao. Only "Jin Duan" was down by about two jiao, which was the largest change. Trading still showed no improvement, and the trend still showed no signs of activity. The total number of transactions was 4.35 million yuan, and there were no spot trades. The high, low, rise, and fall comparisons are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e236">New York Stock Market Rises <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 12th that the New York stock market was firm throughout the day. Later, due to a sharp rise in the value of goods, and with bonds strong, the market situation continued to rise. The strength of goods and bonds was due to the resurgence of inflation concerns, which may be related to the veteran's pension proposal. US public debt and other high-grade bonds fell slightly, and foreign debt was mixed. The total daily trading volume was 1.26 million shares. The supply of wheat decreased from 3,518,000 to 97,122,000 bushels, the smallest number since 1929. Last year's total was 142,431,000 bushels. Prices increased due to the shortage. The cotton market was not very concerned about the impending passage of the Bankhead Act. If it passes and prices rise, bullish traders may take profits at the high, and the market may have a reaction. However, the spot market position is strong and commerce will continue to develop, so it is possible to buy low at that time. The firm also received a report from the New York Standard Statistics Company stating that commercial progress and confidence in corporate profitability are sufficient to overcome the unease caused by overly intrusive legislation and labor proposals. The market situation will go through another period of hesitation, but the long-term trend is bound to be upward. However, investment strategies must be prudent. Stocks that can directly benefit from the recovery should be retained, but it is temporarily not advisable to make further purchases, so as to reserve sufficient purchasing power to await the arrival of opportunities. The recovery of various companies is uneven, but the position of bonds should not be adversely affected, so medium and secondary excellent bonds can be retained or repurchased. The general importance of increasing wages and reducing working hours is overstated, as the party authorities have no intention of forcing all factories to implement them uniformly. Industrial production in March is expected to be 2% higher than in February. Although the proposal to restrict speculation will be amended, it is still difficult to predict exactly how it will be. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Yarn Cotton Yarn Rose Sharply, Then Retraced Slightly <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>After a sharp rise in the yarn market, it retraced slightly, with profit-takers closing positions and market sentiment loosening. However, old standard yarn prices remained firm, and a certain factory absorbed a large amount of it, keeping it closed. It is said that they are determined to take delivery of the goods, but general retail investors see that actual demand is not smooth, and their sentiment tends to be short. What is most strange is that the Golden Rooster New Standard grade is 4 yuan higher, but the retail price has risen by 1 yuan more than the price of the May New Standard term. Current yarn sales are still sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Retail Prices are Still Flat <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the yarn market, profit-takers closed positions, and the market slightly reacted. Prices for each month fell by 7, 8, 9 jiao to 1.2 yuan. In the afternoon, old standards rose by 4.5 jiao due to foreign short covering, and far-month prices fell by 3, 4, 5, 8 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,000 bales. Chunji sold 1,400 bales, Huikang 1,500 bales, Yuande 900 bales, Renfeng 2,350 bales, Taichang 900 bales, Dachang 800 bales, and Xie Sheng 1,200 bales. Fu Da bought 1,150 bales, Da Fu 800 bales, Yuan Da 1,900 bales, Mingde 1,250 bales, Tongxing 950 bales, Changfeng 1,650 bales, and Gengfeng 700 bales.

<p>Current yarn sales are still flat. Statistics for the whole day show that each gang bought 545 bales, and prices rose by 0.25 jiao. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows: Shantou 105, Guangdong 110, Xiamen 15, North Gang 25, Ningbo 20, Mainland 165, and Fellow Traders 5.</p>
<p>The cotton market is dull and lifeless, but the situation feels soft. Because the sources of goods from all routes are seen to be abundant, rumors of factory shutdowns are rampant, and the current cotton demand in the market is sluggish, so sentiment is low. Sellers are very relaxed, but the US cotton market is more stable, while Indian cotton is trending down due to heavy inventory. Local speculators are still in long positions, while Ningbo gangs and cotton merchants are unanimously short, so the market is brewing.</p>

<p>At the opening of the cotton market, with the rise in US cotton not being significant, buyers were flat, and prices for each month fell by 0.15 to 0.2 jiao. In the afternoon, near-month prices rose by 0.05 jiao, and far-month prices were flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 43,400 dan.

<p>The raw cotton business is completely stagnant, and all factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude. There are no arrivals. US cotton rebounded by more than 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market rose due to strength on Wall Street, Neumann bought in, and sellers were scarce. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 pounds, and futures prices rose by 9 to 12 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 4 points, and futures prices fell by 1 point. Block and cotton spot prices fell by 7 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to long positions reluctantly taking profits. As a result, Pinggal fell by 1 rupee 2.5 annas, Omra fell by 1 rupee 7.5 annas, and Bairoxi fell by 2 rupees 7.5 annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 12th):</p>

<p>Customers Return... Small Factories Continue to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw uninspired trading across all months after the morning opening. Foreign wheat prices were quoted, with Chicago being better by 0.3 jiao and Canadian being worse by 0.04 jiao, so sentiment was still steady after the opening. However, because spot customers had no buying interest, the market situation softened. Local factories remained committed, but mainland factories also faced poor sales, so they continued to sell, causing the market to be bleak. At the afternoon opening, the market situation for all months continued to be unfavorable. Long positions returned, and small factories continued to sell, so although the decline was small, sentiment was already panicked. According to industry insiders, because the prices of various grains are low, the recent flour prices cannot meet the purchasing power of farmers. Furthermore, foreign wheat continues to be dumped. It is rumored that another ship of Argentine wheat has been sold at a price of 4.17 yuan. In view of these various comparisons, there is much cause for concern about the future. As a result, March and April terms fell by 0.015 yuan compared to the previous day, May fell by 0.01 yuan, June and July fell by 0.0125 yuan, and August fell by 0.0075 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw mixed price movements in the morning and afternoon sessions, with different months showing rises and falls. The current month's market was tight because most of the chips were absorbed by manufacturers. The internal and external thinking was quite tight. The opening price in the morning was still stable, then it rose. By the afternoon opening, it was even more expensive, reaching as high as four yuan, two jiao, three fen, but after that, it fell back. It was heard that a certain firm was selling foreign wheat, about twenty carloads, which made people feel very tired. After the fall, the April price was still flat at first, and then rose slightly. There were few transactions in the far-term months, and the price was weak. Looking at the future, it is feared that there will be changes in both the near and far terms. As a result, the current month was one fen better, April was three fen better, August was one fen less, and the shift was not comparable. The current wheat market is still stable because the factory appetite is still good. Kai Nan Suzhou wheat was three yuan, six jiao, Wuhe wheat was three yuan, six jiao, Bengbu wheat was three yuan, five jiao, seven fen, and Yingzhou wheat was three yuan, five jiao, half, a total of three thousand bags, which were handled by Fuxin Fufeng, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources from various gangs in the South Market were relatively large due to the sunny weather, totaling more than thirty numbers (four to five thousand shi). On the sales side, the acceptance was still sluggish, and the situation was still quiet. However, the sellers were unwilling to lightly sell off quickly and tried their best to pull up the prices. For example, the prices of common-gang Su Tong, Nan Gang, etc. japonica and Du Yangjian, etc. were unchanged. Qingjiao Sifeng, Xilian, late rice and Nanyang gangs were quite interested in accepting, and the North Yang gangs also had movements. The market was tight, and it was still difficult to relax the eating disk problem. Although there were two thousand more bags of transaction volume, the price only increased by five fen. Special goods showed a soft color, and the supply and demand of change-yin yuan were similar, and there was no difference in the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market had a slight arrival of goods, but the production price had risen, and the owners were consistent in bidding up prices. High-quality goods were welcomed by the local customers, because both inventory and arrivals were small, showing a unique sharpness, three to five fen higher than the previous market. Medium and low-quality goods were originally expected to decline due to large inventories, but because of the active customer demand yesterday, they were also able to hold their ground. Throughout the day, 3,662 bags of Jiangxi, Hunan, Mingguang, Nanjing machine-milled Ke Xian rice were handled by Fuzhou, Fujian Province, 100 bags of early machine-milled rice were shipped to Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, 900 bags of brown rice, 136 bags of change-yin yuan were shipped to Ningbo, 260 bags of local machine-milled red rice, and 260 bags of Liu Cao rice, totaling 5,318 bags. At present, the appetite of Fujian and Zhejiang buyers is still good, and people are optimistic, so the market may have the hope of stepping up gradually.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight return in Customs Gold, and the guild's disk allocation for February 4th coarse sand and white sugar initially was 19 yuan, 6 jiao, 5 fen, and later 19 yuan, 6 jiao, 3 fen, with several hundred bags changing hands. Compared to last week, it fell by seven fen. No. 9 Hechi was 15 yuan, 8 jiao, No. 8 Hechi was 15 yuan, 6 jiao, and Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20 yuan, 1 jiao, with occasional scattered transactions. No. 1 local factory cotton white was 18 yuan, 5 jiao, with each subsequent grade decreasing by 2 jiao. Dozens of bags of full-grade No. 3 tip cotton white from domestic production were opened, with a price of 20 yuan, 5 jiao. Sliced green was in short supply and the market was firm, with a asking price of 9 yuan, 2 jiao, but the firms were not buying. Hainan red had abundant arrivals and inventory, and the market looked weak. Chaozhou green has recently become sluggish in the market, so it is rarely offered. However, according to a letter from Shantou, prices remain firm. People in the industry generally speculate that if sales are strong going forward, there will definitely be a rebound.</p>

<p>Black dates are in short supply because of the poor water output last year. The sales of various gangs have been active recently, and there is a feeling of gradual shortage at the bottom of Shanghai. As a result, the market is firm and prices are rising. It is heard that the current market price for jujube heads is 30 yuan, Chong jujube heads are 24-25 yuan, Gaozhuang is 20 yuan, top grade is 17-18 yuan, middle grade is 14-15 yuan, and even Tongtong hand jujubes are 12-13 yuan.</p>

<p>The spring sales of woolen fabrics have begun, and the local firms' appetite for goods has greatly increased. Yesterday, Qingdao firms such as Sen Tai and Zhen Sheng have come to Shanghai to select and match goods. They have also conveniently looked at summer flannels, broadcloth, serge, barracan, hemp gum cloth, and valitin. The sales of spring woolen fabrics are even more prosperous.

<h3 id="e271">Protest by the German Ambassador to the U.S. <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>According to an eight-day Reuters dispatch: "A large-scale mock trial was held in a certain park in New York last night, with German Chancellor Hitler as the defendant. As a result, Hitler was found guilty of destroying civilization. The German Ambassador to the U.S. lodged a protest with the White House, but it was rejected," and so on.</p>
<p>Seeing the words "mock trial" reminded me of many similar things. There is a Dongyue Temple, commonly known as the Old Dongyue Temple, at the foot of Fahua Mountain in Beilang, Hangzhou. The spring and autumn temple fairs are more lively than any large-scale exhibition. Trials are also held, with the Great Emperor of Dongyue presiding over the court. The bailiffs, clerks, soldiers, yakshas, and impermanent ghosts are all played by living people who have offered sacrifices at the grave. Cauldrons, saws, yokes, iron chains, and all the cruel instruments of torture that exist in the world are prepared. It is said that those suffering from incurable diseases, such as madness that cannot be cured by medicine, only need to go up the mountain in the middle of the night and undergo a court trial once, and the illness will be cured. Therefore, ignorant villagers go to participate in this kind of court trial every year, with the number of people reaching about 30,000 to 50,000 per quarter. This can be regarded as one of the grandest mock trials.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have also seen a Kunqu opera called "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao." It is said that it was originally a kind of the "Four Cries of the Gibbon" script written by Xu Wenchang. The scene in the play is that in the Yama Hall, Miheng, wearing light fur and loose robes, calls Yama his brother. Suddenly, a ghost soldier leads a prisoner with a disheveled beard and a face covered in shackles. After Yama and Miheng discuss it, they order the ghost soldiers to open the shackles, take off the prisoner's clothes, and put on red robes and jade belts, dressing him up as Cao Cao on the stage. Miheng also takes off his light fur, puts on tattered clothes, and re-enacts a good play of "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao." After the play is over, Cao Cao, dressed as a Prime Minister, is teased and beaten by the ghost soldiers a few times, then put back in his prison clothes, shackled, and dragged back into hell. Scholar Mi and Yama drink a few cups of wine and then disperse. Yama even bows and personally sends him out of the hall. This can be regarded as a mock trial in the pen of a literati, to let Miheng's ghost breathe a sigh of relief. As for the iron statues in front of Yue Fei's tomb and the solemnity of the Yu Zhongsu Temple, that is a case turned over after generations, and should naturally be discussed separately. Thinking back to Hitler, he is the kind of person Confucius spoke of who "only fears that he will die without being known or praised." Therefore, he imitates Mussolini's every move. Therefore, a British correspondent said: "Mussolini is a Statesman, but he is a Stageman." It is similar to saying that Sun Shuao is a noble scholar, and the one who wears the clothes of Youmeng is an actor. But after Bismarck and Wilhelm II, Germany has actually produced another outstanding person of the world, so that he is imitated in mock trials. Hitler himself is certainly satisfied, and the German ambassador is really ignorant and still wants to lodge a protest?</p>
<h3 id="e272">Thoughts Provoked by the Left-Lapel <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>On the train from Myitkyina to Mandalay in Upper Burma, the passengers were mostly Burmese and Bai people, needless to say. Just the sight of the men wearing red, green, and colorful skirts like women is enough to evoke a strong exotic mood in the traveler's heart. As for the women, in addition to wearing skirts of various colors, their upper bodies are all in snow-white gauze clothes, and some of the buttons are sewn on the left side. Such peculiar attire immediately reminds one of the people of the ancient State of Chu. According to ancient books, the people of the State of Chu originally wore their lapels on the left. Confucius once sighed like this when praising Guan Zhong's victory over Chu: "Without Guan Zhong, we would be wearing our hair loose and our lapels on the left." Now, in the old land of Chu, Hunan and Hubei, I imagine there are no traces of such attire, but in Upper Burma, I have found it and seen it.</p>
<p>If we take these impressions as a hypothetical proof and add research on race and language, then I dare to say for the time being that the ancient Chu people have not disappeared, but have gradually moved south. However, they are not the current Burmese people (the Burmese, according to "The Tribes of Burma," are a people from the Tibetan Plateau, the same as the Tibetans and the wild people of the Savage Mountain), but the Bai people of Yunnan, the Shan people of Burma (the British call the Bai "Chinese Shan," the Shan "Burmese Shan," and the people of Yunnan call the Shan "Big-Eared Bai"), and the people of Siam. They live in Yunnan in the river basins of the Nu River and the Binlang River (also known as the Daying River, Taiping River, etc.). In Burma, they live in the mountains along the Salween River (the lower reaches of the Nu River in Yunnan) and on both banks of the Irrawaddy River in Upper Burma (the Binlang River in Yunnan flows into the Irrawaddy River at Bhamo). In Siam, almost all the important cities can be said to be theirs. As for language, most of them are the same, but there are also small differences. For example, the very common noun "to eat rice," the Siamese and Shan people call it "King Kao," while the Bai call it "King Hao." And the writing is also the same. According to Xie Bin's "Travels in Yunnan," the Bai use Burmese writing, which is wrong. It can only be said that they use Siamese writing, because the book he based it on is "The Brief History of the Borders of Pusi," compiled by Ke Shuxun, who was responsible for the borders of Pusi in Yunnan, and the area along the borders of Pusi is precisely where the Shan people live, bordering Siam.</p>
<p>The above explains that the Bai, Shan, and Siamese people are one people. As for the proof that they migrated from the Yangtze River in China? This depends on the history of Siam. The origin chapter cites the theory of an Italian linguist, who said that the Siamese people migrated from the Yangtze River basin in China in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, because their language still has similarities with the roots of the language of the Chinese people south of the Yangtze River today. As far as I know, several numbers like one, two, three, four, five... in the Zhangquan dialect of Fujian, the Chaozhou dialect of Guangdong, and the Qiongya dialect are exactly the same as what the Bai say. Also, the Bai call "dawn" "Fa Liang," and the meaning of the word "Liang" is the same as our general Mandarin. There is also the dialect of the Chengdu Plain in Sichuan, which calls "distilled grains" "Lao Cao," and the Bai call "eating wine" "King Lao," which is similar again. There are many other similar examples, but due to space limitations, I will not list them all.</p>
<p>Because of the linguistic evidence, and seeing the women's clothes with the left lapel, the hypothesis that the Chu people moved south floated into my mind. Whether this speculation is valid naturally requires detailed research. This article, as the title suggests, is only a beginning.</p>

<p>— Tang</p>
<p>(Four) Anniversary Memorial "The years are truly aimless, but I still have to endure, since death has not yet come, the joys of life have abandoned me." This is the last stanza of my elegy, written after my father passed away last year, and now it has been a full year. In this year, I don't understand how I have been living, I have just been "enduring." The family has gone through many storms again, and although my mother is managing things, the greatest responsibility still falls on me. Whenever I feel depressed, I often think of writing something about my father, but I never get around to it.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in the family is the economy. In fact, the talk of poverty has been around for a long time, but at that time, relying on my father's reputation, we could still manage to make ends meet. Moreover, my father, like my mother, placed half of his hopes on me, and they tightly concealed the deteriorating state of the family, not letting me know anything. On the surface, guests came and went, and everything inside and out was busy with social interactions, bustling and lively, almost like prosperity. How could I ever have experienced the feeling of being completely impoverished! I only knew that they always had the same smiling face when they saw me. How could I know that behind this smiling face, they were hiding a bitterness more bitter than Coptis chinensis!</p>
<p>I now cherish my childhood because in my childhood there was innocence and happiness. And I know that my innocence and happiness were woven from two sorrowful and compassionate hearts.</p>
<p>But the true meaning of life finally pulled me out of the circle of happiness. After several attacks of worries, my father fell ill in the summer four years ago. First, he had spasms in his limbs and confusion of his mind, and then he turned into mild epilepsy, which came and went from time to time. And then on this day a year ago, on a quiet winter afternoon, he quietly left this world. He wasn't even fifty years old, but he had to go, he wasn't even fifty years old!</p>
<p>Now, now it is a full year.</p>
<p>On this anniversary, because it is New Year's Eve, it is said that even crying must be avoided. I don't even have the freedom to shed a single tear. This time, we won't hold a Taoist ceremony or Buddhist service, just offer a few bowls of fruit, a few plates of dishes, burn a pot of incense, and quietly commemorate this endless sorrow.</p>
<p>We all held back our tears, endured the grief in our hearts, and felt a surge of sourness in our noses.</p>
<p>My mother burned the paper money. I watched the ashes fly up from the ground, and then watched two crystal-clear tears flow from the corner of my mother's eyes. I understood the true meaning of life. Relying on two arms and a brain, I am ready to live on!</p>

<h3 id="e275">On "Branding" <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>"Branding" by the young poet Zang Kejia is the most noteworthy collection of poems recently. The author experienced the bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside after the "September 18th Incident" and felt the profound pain of life. He sings about them in poetry with realistic and ordinary materials. He also sings about his own personal experience of the bitterness of life. His short poems can be said to be one side of the symbol of the poetic era.</p>
<p>Although living under the influence of the "Crescent Moon" poets, Zang Kejia, in terms of the form of poetry, has adopted the free verse of the petty bourgeoisie, which is also a noteworthy point of his psychological consciousness. In the heart of this young man, there are quite a few demands for liberalism.</p>
<p>But although he subjectively demands liberalism, the old remnants are constantly binding him. In his body, it seems that there are two forces constantly conflicting with each other and hindering each other, making him unable to develop either aspect as he wishes. I think that in the end, one side will win. This depends on which side he strives to lean towards in the future.</p>
<p>Throughout the small collection of poems "Branding," it reflects the disharmony between Zang's idealism and realism, and the disharmony between the poet's personal expression and his social expression. This disharmony prevents him from completing his liberalism and achieving his goal of self-liberation.</p>
<p>From the collapsing countryside, he saw the cities of the semi-colonies in economic panic. This contradiction arose in his small and weak heart, which is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>He savors his own "philosophy of life" in his heart. Judging from his poems, his inner life is quite profound. His inner life experience made him create his philosophy of life of perseverance and imprison himself. If you want to find his philosophy in his poems, Stoicism is everywhere. From the countryside to the city, he saw all the troubles in the modern city. Cars, trams, the electric lights at night, the intoxication of the flesh, jazz music, etc., all the evils of the city, fraud, deception, and all kinds of strange shady scenes, made him feel that it is difficult to walk in the world. Unable to adapt to this new environment, he felt that...this is not just messing around for fun, this is life, ten thousand hidden arrows are lurking around you, waiting for you to be careless in a thousand precautions.</p>
<p>("Life")</p>
<p>He curses the "ghost-like crowds" in the city at night ("The Night of the City"). He cannot use his reason to analyze society and grasp reality. He cannot scientifically organize his impressions and thus gain correct knowledge. He hopes conceptually, and reaches disillusionment through hope. Therefore, he "remembers only a patch of black shadows" and wants to "recognize life from the needle." He doubts, he feels emptiness. In the end, he creates his philosophy of "living by chewing on bitterness." This Stoicism matches all the poems in "Branding." (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e276">Dusk (Four) <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Every morning, waking up from a comfortable sleep, the sunlight shining through the window screen has already covered their beds and the floor. Good dreams may still linger in their minds, but thinking of the long days, they frown slightly again. Although everything is so good materially, there is always something missing. They all know this lack very well, and it has become irreparable. At this time, the maid will quietly push open the door and walk in, and if there is no wind or rain, she will open the windows for them first. Waves of lilac or magnolia fragrance will pour in from the window. They put on their clothes, get out of bed, and stare blankly at the beautiful scenery outside the window.</p>
<p>If it is spring, they can see the ground exuding the breath of spring, and they seem to be able to hear the sound of grass roots sprouting in the soil, and the willow branches swaying softly and long in the wind. The maid will surely say gently: "Miss, don't just stand by the window, the spring breeze is cold. The bath water has been prepared." So they drag their lazier steps reluctantly to the bathroom, and then, after twenty or thirty minutes, they walk out wearily, with their hair scattered over their shoulders. The maid has already closed the window for them at this time, and then brings in breakfast.</p>
<p>After getting dressed, their self-determined work begins. Sometimes they copy calligraphy or draw meticulous figures, sometimes they play the guqin, or Qing Song listens attentively to Qing Zhi blowing the xiao, and the days pass by seemingly easily.</p>
<p>Because they were worried that they were too lonely, the family members used to come to their rooms often, but they immediately saw that they were not interested, and except for their mother, they even showed a little annoyance. So they agreed not to disturb them anymore. When they see people, they hardly say a word, and they show a very unnatural expression, but they don't say anything embarrassing. They just frown or show a helpless look.</p>
<p>Outside this room, this family becomes floating. Qing Shi's wife once cried and made a fuss because Qing Shi did not return all night. Sometimes, she woke up the sleeping people in the middle of the night because the two-year-old child cried for too long, and the mother wondered if there was something wrong with him. Or there was something unclear between the male and female servants... but these things cannot affect them, and even the sounds of the noise are blocked by the doors and windows, becoming extremely faint or non-existent.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Qing Song seems to be completely captured by painting. She draws patiently, and allows two sick-looking red flushes to appear on her pale yellow cheeks because her head has been lowered for too long, and she also reveals a bit of panic as she searches for different colored and ink brushes. Occasionally, a trace of a smile appears on her face, and she still works quietly on her work. Qing Zhi, who is reading a novel, will surely say to him or her.</p>

<h3 id="e277">The Kalachakra Dharma Assembly <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Our China is a country with flourishing culture, so it has always valued courtesy and cherished peace. This spirit has been passed down to the present, and its merits are already beyond instruction. In addition, after Xuanzang's "Journey to the West" brought back the Vajra from the Southern Hua, it was even more evident that everything in the world is nothing but flowers in a mirror and the moon in the water, that is, form is emptiness, and its influence is unknown how many people it has poisoned. However, the general proponents of national essence spare no effort to shout and scream, regarding it as the "ancient civilization" of the Yanhuang Sage, and the foundation of China's national destiny and people's fortune.</p>
<p>This fact is manifested so that we can see it anytime and anywhere... praying for "one side of tranquility" and seeking "avoidance of disasters" is truly a matter of national destiny and the survival of the nation. The reason why my country has become so magnificent is that everyone holds the view that the hardships of life are caused by past lives in samsara. All living beings, the vast world, and many "ill-fated" events in the world are caused by the will of heaven and the divine decree in the underworld.</p>
<p>China is currently in a time of great trouble. Natural disasters, man-made disasters, domestic troubles, and foreign invasions are really coming one after another, making the whole country unable to live or die. In this fiery heat, we are now using our "ancient" magic weapon to find a way out through the hot pursuit of "sincerity brings spirituality." After the September 18th Incident, when the national crisis was imminent, the Panchen Lama was invited to hold the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly in Beiping, and the Great Light Water and Land Dojo was opened. After the Battle of Shanghai, in the ashes, there was also a temporary "National Crisis Dojo" to pray for peace. These are the most obvious examples. As for the many "benevolent people and good men" who take the world as their responsibility, they often advocate writing scriptures, reciting repentance, and building Buddhist halls after their worries, which is almost extremely popular. Examining its meaning and tracing its heart, it is natural to have the desire to eliminate national disasters and save the crisis, but according to the law of the jungle, whether it will make us "have whatever we ask for" is once again vague and speculative.</p>
<p>Do we not see that the smoke of war in Shanghai has just ceased, and bombing sounds have been heard in Luan and Yu. As for the autonomy of Inner Mongolia, the independence of Southern Xinjiang, the invasion of Southwesterners, and the rebellion in Fujian, they all indicate that not only has the crisis not been eliminated and the national disaster not been resolved, but it seems that crises are lurking everywhere, with fire coming out of every hole and smoke rising from every crevice. However, this is because the Chinese nation has deep sins and cannot escape the calamity, and it is not that the prayers are insufficient.</p>
<p>Although it is said that heaven's will is like this, and the descendants of Yan and Huang should be unlucky, but rather than sitting and waiting for death, why not try to do a little "human affairs" in despair? This is why our eminent monks who rely on Buddhism still want to make persistent efforts to seek liberation, and use the supernatural powers of the "Living Buddha" to save China from danger. At that time, the treasure hall will be filled with clouds, and the incense will be curling, and there will be a grand scene.</p>
<p>If burning incense and worshiping Buddha could drive away evil and avoid disasters, then the Boxers of the late Qing Dynasty would have already succeeded, and we would not have to wait for the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly now. Chinese people are superstitious, often thinking of taking the enemy's head from a thousand miles away with leather armor and flying swords. The Panchen Lama's magic is boundless. After this prayer, it can make those invaders repent and change their ways. Then let me kneel down three times and kowtow nine times here, and recite a few "Namo Amitabha".</p>

<p>— A Beggar Writer</p>
<p>I, this beggar, came into the world late. The extravagant lifestyles of my friends, like Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dancing, and the amorous affairs of love story writers who kept mistresses, I was unable to witness, which is a lifelong regret. But crows are black the world over; from one instance, you can infer three. In this corner of a thousand-mile expanse, the land is lively enough.</p>
<p>A random essay about groping buttocks, liberation verses for playing mahjong, sparked a battle like the Chu-Han Contention. This newfangled stuff really caused a sensation, more pleasing to the eye than models swaying their fat hips and twisting their waists. One wave subsides, and another rises. The Beijing-Shanghai literary war was even more thunderous, with direct hand-to-hand combat, making it extremely enjoyable.</p>
<p>Having watched one act after another, it's truly dazzling, and one can't help but shout "Bravo!"</p>
<p>Although the tricks of the old guard are genuine skills, how can the young heroes quietly submit? It's perfectly fine to hold and play with trinkets, but there's no harm in competing. They too stage a continuous, excellent show. "The younger generation is to be feared," this humble beggar can't help but sigh three times, putting down my pen.</p>
<p>Submitting one's own works for others to publish seems to have existed since ancient times. Many so-called writers have built Western-style houses through such means. But having voluntarily agreed (presumably not through coercion) beforehand, why regret it later? It's said that such buried talents can be measured by cartloads. Probably, for the sake of not burying talent, a case of indecency involving someone under sixteen years old was made. As for the content, it will naturally be fairly judged by legal experts; I won't elaborate here.</p>
<p>This case is somewhat more serious than the previous two. This humble beggar is not promoting chaos and stirring up trouble, but even telescopes sometimes get dust particles flying into them. However, while playing mahjong requires the courage to start a major conflict, this double-edged case concerning the guest seat – the literary world – and future reputation, I wonder what the "masters" have to say about it!</p>

<p>Hometown Jottings</p>
<p>I said goodbye to my uncle in Shanghai and ran downstairs. In the common room, I met my eldest cousin, who was already a mother of three. She asked me when I would be back and if I had met Sister ×.</p>
<p>A shadow flashed across my mind, seven or eight years ago!</p>
<p>Every New Year, my uncle would keep me at his house, and I often forgot the start of school. A foster daughter of my uncle's also occupied the place.</p>
<p>"They make a great couple!" my uncle would say jokingly after drinking in the evening.</p>
<p>"A little married couple!" the cousins would seize on the remark, gossiping without restraint.</p>
<p>We knew to blush and avoid each other. But – when no one was watching, we would smile at each other.</p>
<p>One morning before the sun rose, a letter was handed to me.</p>
<p>That letter, preserving seven or eight years of time, remained in my bookcase in my hometown, forever after.</p>
<p>"Brother, we can't talk anymore, it's really annoying!</p>
<p>This semester, I'm applying to Shanghai ×× Girls' School. If I'm accepted, we can meet in Shanghai. I'm going home today."</p>
<p>Unable to verify the original, I retained as much of the original essence as possible. We met in Shanghai. My uncle's jest became reality – we were truly in love. The love continued... One year, two years, three years... She graduated from junior high. The student became a teacher. Every week, we were the proud figures of Shanghai. The love continued intermittently.</p>
<p>Another teacher was pursuing her. One day, she handed me a letter – a sweet love letter. "What's the meaning of this?" I casually asked. "It can be read as a collection of love letters." She smiled. "The one in the Western suit?" She nodded. The first kiss of first love. The love continued intermittently. Four years. Five years, six years...</p>
<p>A letter arrived from the post office. "Life is too boring. I took two days off from school. Staying at my eldest sister's house last night (the eldest sister who is a mother of three) was also meaningless. Tonight, shall we go to Donghua (now Paris) to see 'Love Tragedy'? Whoever arrives first waits for the other."</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>A loophole... I had already left school. My family couldn't afford university fees. I worked in an office during the day and attended night school in the evening, living alone in a small attic room in a corner of Shanghai.</p>
<p>I skipped my specially chosen Japanese class and took a tram to Avenue Joffre. It was 8:30 PM. She was sitting there waiting for me. We chose a corner in the cinema. "The one who's aggressively pursuing you?" I asked. She shook her head. "It's too tiring!" "So you need to be in love." She gently tapped the back of my hand. "Love Tragedy" appeared in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Where to?" I asked as we walked closely along Avenue Joffre after watching Greta Garbo die in the film. "It's early." We talked, walked, and laughed until we arrived at my home. We kissed in the attic room. At 2:00 AM, she showed no sign of leaving. "Won't your cousin be sleeping late?" "She's already dreaming." "Then you should go back to school?" "I took two days off, saying I was going home." She replied, her face flushed. "×Na, no!" I grabbed her arms, stared at her, and remained silent for a long time. Finally, I quietly sent her back to school. The next evening, I received a letter from her. She confessed, she asked for my forgiveness... The love continued... I fell ill, spending three months in a third-class hospital ward. I returned to my hometown, a desolate temple-like house. I was sick for a year. I received two letters from her, one-fiftieth of the number I sent.</p>
<p>I returned to Shanghai and went to her school. She told me she was engaged to the man in the Western suit. She got married and became a mother of one... Seven years, eight years... "She came back yesterday. I haven't seen her," I replied to my eldest cousin, hurriedly walking out. My eldest cousin's sigh followed me. Garbo's car sped toward a tree, crashing loudly, shattering to pieces, both person and car. (From "Love Tragedy") A shadow flashed across my mind, seven or eight years ago!</p>

<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>"If you cannot dominate the field of love in life, you should also leave a fragrant name on the battlefield in death" - An advertisement for "Serving the Country with Glory" - Ling He has already given an appropriate critique of the film "Serving the Country with Glory." It is a film of a speculative nature, and this spirit is also infused into the advertisement - This is the shamelessness and sin of the declining intellectuals! This is completely pandering to the general muddle-headed youth who like to show off, with such muddle-headed things.</p>
<p>According to this advertisement, it seems that as long as one can dominate the field of love in life, there is no need to die on the battlefield; dying on the battlefield is because one cannot dominate the field of love. Therefore, dying on the battlefield is not the motive for serving the country with glory, but dominating the field of love is the motive for serving the country with glory. This fully demonstrates the shameful ignorance of the shameful intellectuals - Does this not completely demonstrate the ignorance of the leisured class towards the concept of the nation? What is the nation? Answer me!</p>
<p>Here, we should not think that it is one person's mistake. There are many, many of me, the entire leisured class, completely has such a mistake - a blindness to the two words "nation."</p>
<p>And this person exposed this ignorance on behalf of these people because he reflected this social consciousness. The two words "nation" are an empty concept. We must understand what its essence is - why should we strive for its glory instead of striving for our own?</p>
<p>Only after understanding what the essence of this nation is can we talk about everything else.</p>
<p>And what we are striving for is "glory." Is it "benefit"? - If we strive for glory but lose our own benefit, it is better not to strive for glory. - If we strive for our own benefit but lose empty glory, benefit is better. We should not strive for empty glory, but for our own real benefit!</p>
<p>I conclude that this advertisement is a humorous advertisement. It is made to satirize the members of the leisured class.</p>

<h3 id="e282">The Life of a Family <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Guanhua</p>
<p>Dear Editor: It is truly shameful to say that I am already twenty years old and will soon be a high school graduate! However, regarding my own affairs - family problems, or rather, the crisis of my future - I have thought about it again and again, but I have never come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Now, I have decided to tell Mr. Editor in detail about my family situation and problems...</p>
<p>(1) Source of Income - My grandfather was originally a very poor private school teacher. Fortunately, my father had some intelligence and talent, and twenty years ago, he made a mess of teaching and being a politician (not very much), and got some money and wealth (not much), so I was able to go to school from a young age. His current occupation is different from before. In the countryside, he is both a gentleman and employs workers to till the fields, and he also has two small shops in small market towns outside. Originally, there were three shops in total in the early years, but due to the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of commerce in recent years, the larger one in the city closed down at the end of last year!</p>
<p>(2) Family Situation - The lives of my family of more than ten people (including two orphaned sons of my deceased uncle and several workers and maids) are all supported by the above-mentioned occupations, and the above-mentioned occupations must be maintained by my father alone. I have six brothers and three sisters in total. My mother only gave birth to me and two older sisters (already married). The only male child is me. The other five younger brothers and one younger sister (all unmarried, now four younger brothers and my younger sister are all studying) were all born to my stepmother. By the orders of my parents and the urging of relatives, I got married when I was seventeen years old after graduating from junior high school, and I already have children! Since the Republic of China, until the year before last, although my mother would sometimes quarrel with my stepmother, they always cared about their reputation and no major violent incidents occurred. It can be said that they "lived in peace."</p>
<p>(3) The Occurrence of the Problem - It was around March or April of last year, my father took a fancy to a maid in his own home, so he took her as his third concubine. After that, her mother often came to my house to make trouble. If her mother only wanted some money to use, my father could have given it to her because he loved her daughter. However, she wanted to make an agreement with my mother - to have me and my younger siblings call her daughter "Mom," etc. - such indecent conditions, how could my mother and stepmother be willing to obey her? So they made trouble, making a complete mess. Under this circumstance, if my father could handle it properly, the problem would not have escalated. However, my father was both infatuated with the maid and had no way to deal with her mother. All the disputes were blamed on my old mother. Therefore, my old mother developed the thought of being tired of the world.</p>
<p>(4) Hopelessness of Resolution - I know that my father's behavior, although "taking a maid as a concubine" is acceptable in popular customs, in law, he has committed the crime of raping a young girl under Article ?. Therefore, in order to make my father change his ways, and also for the sake of my family's reputation and my academic future, etc., I once wrote many letters to persuade my father, and also wrote letters to persuade my mother and asked my wife to persuade my mother not to pay attention to all their rights and wrongs, and let my father do as he pleases. However, my father did not accept my advice and was still confused and muddle-headed, and my wife was stupid and did not know how to mediate from it, and my mother was even more unable to bear it and often argued with the maid's mother and my father.</p>
<p>(5) Future Crisis - Mr. Editor, you think how dangerous this phenomenon is! Originally, according to my personal strange views, copper coins are hateful things, and the legacy of my father's industry is especially not worth cherishing. Secondly, my father's behavior - polygamy, indulging in lust - should be eradicated, whether for the sake of customs or for the sake of society. However, he has also done a lot of good for society - the lives of my family of more than ten people all depend on him, and the studies of my brothers all depend on him. If he is accused of his crimes (the mediocre maid, although she is now under my father's lustful power and has not shown any resistance. But her mother's greed, and her future conduct, cannot be changed), and he is imprisoned or goes bankrupt, wouldn't the lives of my family be ruined? Mr. Editor, you pity my young siblings and my old mother, and my ability is not enough to bear such a great responsibility!</p>
<p>(6) Several Questions - I now want to ask Mr. Editor to come up with a few methods. How can the maid's mother be prevented from coming to my house to quarrel with my mother in the future (it must be known that my father's small amount of material wealth cannot fill her endless greedy sea!)? If she comes to my house to ask for money or things, what attitude should my mother and my brothers and wife take? How can we prevent or avoid the maid's mother from accusing my father of his crimes? How can my father's crimes be mitigated? My father's crime - if she accuses him of raping a young girl (I am not very clear whether the maid's age is eighteen or seventeen) or other crimes - what is the highest and lowest sentence he should be imprisoned for? And is there a possibility of bankruptcy? If my father is imprisoned or goes bankrupt, what should I do and what ways can I maintain the lives of my family of more than ten people?</p>
<p>I hope that Mr. Editor, no matter how busy you are with work, please take some time to think of a solution for me! And I hope that Mr. Editor will think from my position and environment! I am now waiting for Mr. Editor to reply in the "Amateur Mailbox" of your esteemed newspaper or directly, and I will not only thank you in my heart, but also wish you well! Your follower Chen Guanhua</p>
<p>(The reply will be continued tomorrow)</p>

<p>— Written by Italian M. Celao, Translated by Jing Xin</p>
<p>Sophia's voice was solemn and resonant. Robert listened with great joy, as if he were hearing it for the first time. He felt as if he were facing a woman he had never met before. Her every word and every expression revealed her unique personality. Sophia had lost her cold appearance. She even looked at him, smiled, and talked to him as if he were a friend. How had they been before? What were they like now?</p>
<p>"When I like a book," Robert continued, "I always want to know the author very much, to know if he (or she) is kind, if he has suffered, if he has suffered, if he has ever loved -" "Perhaps you will be disillusioned. Writers always depict the love of others, but do not write about their own."</p>
<p>"Probably because they are concerned." "I think it is because of jealousy. In many cases, love is the only treasure hidden in the soul." But when Sophia said these words, her voice did not change. Her face showed such a frank expression, and her tone was so simple, so pure, so sincere, that Robert was not surprised to hear her talk about love so frankly. Nothing surprised him now. Everything seemed natural, expected. Even being alone with this strange daughter tonight seemed destined and long awaited. When they parted, they stared at each other face to face, as if hoping to confirm their renewed acquaintance. Sophia extended her hand, Robert took it, and bowed over it. A curtain fell heavily behind him. They parted.</p>
<p>After the charm of Sophia's face and speech disappeared, Robert felt confused, his head spinning. They were both joyful and melancholic, wanting to die, and yet full of vitality. He didn't know how to think about Lulu, about himself, about his future.</p>
<p>Sophia was very happy, very happy. For this reason, she cried, sobbing painfully, her head buried in her pillow.</p>
<p>Three months passed, and Lulu's wedding was still postponed. Her mother, who did not understand the reason for the postponement, often called her daughter aside and asked her for the reason.</p>

<h3 id="e284">Roosevelt's Movie Revival Movement <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yang</p>
<p>Since the Democratic Party came to power in the United States and took control of the government of the United States of America, it has been frantically implementing the Blue Eagle Movement - that is, the American Revival Movement.</p>
<p>Roosevelt provided relief to agriculture and industry and proposed the "Agricultural Act" and the "Emergency Plan." He dreamed of rescuing the United States from the flood of total collapse. Therefore, he also stipulated a "revival plan" for the film industry, one of the five major industries in the United States. Because, from 1932 to 1933, the American film industry experienced an "economic depression year" that was historically unprecedented. "Paramount Pictures," whose deficit reached as high as 30 million gold yuan, was almost bankrupt by January of this year. The rest, such as Warner Brothers, Fox, etc., all encountered an unprecedented economic panic. By the spring of this year, Roosevelt's expansion policy was effectively implemented, and like the general business community, the film industry also enjoyed a little bit of an optimistic atmosphere like the Indian summer of October. However, whether it can actually reverse the film industry's panic cannot be said today. What is seen is only Will Hayes's brain-wracking new control plan.</p>
<p>Will Hayes is the authority in the American film industry. He recently made five recommendations to the M.P.P.D.A. (abbreviation for Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, the representative body of the American film industry, whose president is Will Hayes).</p>
<p>1.  Return movie theaters to their old owners. Two thousand movie theaters went bankrupt in the past year. The reduction in the number of viewers is endless, and the rational control of screenings is essential.</p>
<p>2.  Regional distribution contracts. If this plan is implemented, it can save 6 million gold yuan in unnecessary expenses each year. In order to unify affairs, film storage warehouses must be established in various regions.</p>
<p>3.  Savings in production costs. This is always necessary, especially at this time. It must be thoroughly implemented as the basis for rationalization. Salary reductions for actors are useless as a partial makeshift policy.</p>
<p>4.  Consolidate necessary franchise rights in film production. From the sound recording of sound films to general technology, original works, etc., the rationalization of organization can save production costs.</p>
<p>5.  Film purification movement. Just as international coordination diplomacy is the mask of imperialism, gentlemen's agreements must be concluded between producers on the surface, thereby achieving the control of large capital monopoly.</p>
<p>Will Hayes racked his brains and came up with this control method for the American film industry, which was bankrupt again and again. He injected a life-saving injection for the American film industry. He became the "only loyal subject" of Roosevelt's movie revival movement. But can this film rationalization plan achieve some degree of effect?</p>
<p>Needless to say, the economic depression in the American film industry is not so simple that it can be reversed by this control. Because it is one of the large enterprises, it must sensitively reflect the general trends of the capitalist economy, and at the same time, it cannot be immune to the changes in the world financial market at all times.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether Roosevelt's movie revival movement can revive the American film industry, I am afraid that even Roosevelt himself is not sure now!</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3 id="e285">Review of "Isle of Paradise" <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Isle of Paradise - Jincheng -</p>
<p>Regarding documentary films of local customs and cultures, there is undoubtedly great value in science. However, it must be explained in detail here that a documentary film is by no means a purely objective transfer of things from a certain place to the screen unconditionally. On the contrary, it must pass through the subjective views of the author and be filmed after the author's own thinking and selection. Therefore, documentary films still represent the author's thoughts and belong to his own class, becoming something that is beneficial to this class. Obviously, the author of "Isle of Paradise" tried his best to adopt the lives and simple human feelings of the people of that small island. This is to say that that place is a paradise on earth, and the workers of the Dutch are living and working in peace and contentment, without any worries. Moreover, the Dutch authorities have tried to improve agriculture or fishery with machines, but the natives do not comply. At the same time, the Dutch government is also doing its best to improve superstitions, etc. All of these attempt to explain that the Dutch government is very kind to the natives, but the so-called barbaric workers are too stubborn.</p>
<p>Here, is it not enough to prove the author's intentions? The Dutch island is already "Isle of Paradise." Please let imperialism rule the world, because we can live and work in peace. Although I have not been to Southeast Asia, I believe that the people under the rule of imperialism are definitely not so pure and kind.</p>
<p>Movies have become a weapon of resistance, but they are also a tool of rule. Of course, documentary films are no exception.</p>
<p>There is another issue that is worth raising here, and that is whether documentary films also need the interspersion of stories?</p>
<p>When I walked out of the Jincheng Grand Theater, I heard many people say, "It doesn't make any sense." This is by no means accidental. Even at the time of the screening, many people left the venue. This is because they could not stand such a dull atmosphere. They are not used to movies without a story, because in people's habits, they come to see the bizarre and tortuous stories.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a problem of the audience's cultural level. Most of them are unwilling to treat the cinema as a classroom. We have not forgotten the lessons learned when "Spring Silkworms" was screened. Then, in order to make up for the shortcomings of this transitional era, I think it is still necessary to construct a simple story in documentary films. This is to say that we must increase the audience's interest in the picture.</p>
<p>However, we are in principle opposed to adding stories to documentary films, because that will lose the true value of introduction and record. However, under the conditions that do not harm the record of local customs, why not intersperse everything that we should record in the story? "Eskimo" gave us an excellent example. - The above, I hope to attract the attention of readers.</p>
<p>Speaking of this film, I think the photography skills, framing methods, and picture montage are very commendable. If you are a group of people who want to know the local customs and cultures of Southeast Asia, this is undoubtedly a very valuable film.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Three Questions That Scared Little Van Dyke <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Response</p>
<p>Not long ago, Little Van Dyke returned to Hollywood from London, preparing to produce a "Success Story." He arrived by plane. At the airport, many journalists were waiting for him. As soon as his foot touched the ground, he was surrounded by the journalists. Everyone knows that American journalists like to be direct and unceremonious. So, one reporter began to ask, "I heard that your father is about to marry Lady Ashworth. Do you like it or not?" Little Van Dyke was momentarily stunned, not knowing how to respond. Afterward, he told his friend that he wished he could punch that journalist in the nose, but she was a female reporter, so he couldn't be too reckless. So, he could only touch his cheek and pretend to ponder, "Lady Ashworth... let me think... the name is familiar, but I can't quite remember." (Presumably, readers will remember that this Lady Ashworth is old Van Dyke's lover. Her husband has already filed for divorce in court, accusing old Van Dyke of adultery. This news has been published in newspapers at home and abroad not long ago.)</p>
<p>Before he could dodge one bullet, another one came. The second question was, "Are you willing to let Joan Crawford marry Francbot Lone?" This was simply outrageous. So, without waiting for the third shot, he ran away. The third question, it is said, was, "When are you going to marry Gertrude Lawrence?" Gertrude is a London actress. She is already thirty-five years old, while Little Van Dyke is only twenty-six years old. It is said that they are deeply in love and do not mind the age difference. But according to news from London, Gertrude herself has denied the matter. However, in terms of age, it is not strange for the wife to be older than the husband. Among Hollywood stars, Swanson is older than Fairbairn, and Clark Gable's wife is also older than him, so it's not surprising.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Katherine Hepburn's Husband <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Fulun</p>
<p>Not long ago, this publication published a piece saying that American actress Katherine Hepburn imitated Greta Garbo's eccentricity, deliberately being vague about everything about herself, making people suspicious. Some people say she's been married and has two children, and she says, "Isn't that right, I have two children, one as white as snow, and one as black as pitch!" After she said that, she laughed non-stop. Do you believe her or not? Now, it has been confirmed that she has been married before. Katherine's husband's name is Ludlow Smith, a broker for an insurance company in New York. They have been married for three years. Presumably, from now on, Katherine won't deny it again!</p>

<p>(1) "Red Chamber Spring Depths" started filming the day before yesterday. The film is written by Cao Xuesong, directed by the bearded Gao Lihen, and stars Chen Yumei. (2) The new photography studio is currently under construction with doubled efforts. It is expected that it will be completed in another week. The company authorities added two new-style cameras yesterday, as well as a large number of mercury lamps and giant light bulbs, for use in the new photography studio. (3) Wang Cilong's "Two Brothers From" was completed earlier. However, during the screening the other day, Wang Cilong felt that the outdoor shots needed to be reshot, so he led the staff to the Bund yesterday morning to reshoot the morning scenery on the river. (4) During the screening of "Red Powder Iron Blood" the other day, all those who participated in the screening praised it unanimously, believing it to be a super-special work by Wang Yuanlong. (5) "Spring Night Song" filmed a dance hall scene last night. The dance hall scene was huge, occupying seven-tenths of the entire photography studio, and was designed by artist Xu Xingzhi. More than a hundred male and female extras were hired during the filming, acting as dancers and dance hostesses. The female lead, Ye Qiuxin, wore Western-style attire, with jade arms and fair wrists, and was extremely beautiful. (6) "Songstress's Scandalous History" has been completed and is now being edited and will soon be sent to Beijing for review. (Respectfully submitted)</p>

<p>The film "Blaze," directed by Hu Rui and starring Peng Fei and Hu Ping, produced by Yihua Film Company, has been in production for several months, sacrificing a lot of money and effort. It was just completed last month. In the film, the strongman Peng Fei performs in a fire pit, which is very thrilling, and Hu Ping lying on her back in the raging fire also makes people's souls fly to the ninth heaven. Now "Blaze" has been completely passed by the Nanjing Film Review Board. Once the sound dubbing is completed, it will be publicly screened at the highest-level theater in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e290">Romantic History of Mount Hua (3) <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Chun</p>
<p>Soon after, the revolutionary army quickly occupied Shanghai. The Shanghai Alumni Association of Jinghua University, initiated by Hong Jiachen and others, held a welcome party for their old classmate, Chen Beifeng, a revolutionary comrade who had fought hard in Hunan and Hubei.</p>
<p>At the welcome party, Beifeng met old friends and also met Jiachen and Yulan, who had caused him to suffer a crushing defeat in love. Everyone warmly welcomed him. He looked down at the bright red corsage and suddenly remembered the blood on Huang Zhensheng's chest when he died in battle, which made him feel lost.</p>
<p>Jiachen and Yulan greeted Beifeng warmly, but it also made Beifeng feel a little sad. Yulan stared at him and said happily, "Beifeng, I haven't seen you in three years, and you are already a revolutionary hero!"</p>
<p>"You are a modern, beautiful lady!" Beifeng replied. Jiachen said beside him, "Alas! Time has changed us all."</p>
<p>Indeed, time has changed them! Beifeng has become a soldier with a face full of dust and deep melancholy, while Jiachen is already a young gentleman, and Yulan is a charming and romantic modern young woman.</p>
<p>The wine, the green lights, and the noisy laughter of the classmates could not arouse Beifeng's interest. When the banquet was over, someone saw Beifeng's melancholy and stood up to suggest to everyone, "We should make the most of this rare opportunity to have some recreational activities..." This suggestion was approved by everyone, and he turned his head and pointed to Beifeng and said, "Classmates, you won't forget Beifeng's music, will you? Now I propose... please Brother Beifeng play a song here!"</p>
<p>Beifeng declined, but when he saw Yulan clapping, he pondered for a moment, as if something was driving him, and immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Playing the old tune again, Beifeng's face was full of sadness. This color then infected Yulan's face, and she lowered her head and also became melancholy because of the piano sound. Jiachen was also pondering beside him.</p>
<p>Amid the firecracker-like applause, Beifeng finished playing, and when he stood up to salute the crowd, he was also filled with sadness, and tears almost welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>Because of the感慨 of the vicissitudes of life and because of the unexpected impact of the environment, Beifeng became passive again.</p>
<p>One lonely morning, when Yulan was washing up, the maid brought in a letter from Beifeng. After she read the letter, her face suddenly turned a terrible gray. She hurriedly got into a car and rushed to the hotel where Beifeng was staying. The porter told her, "Mr. Chen has already returned to the headquarters early in the morning." She ran to the headquarters again, and the adjutant said to her, "Captain Chen has already left on the early train. I heard he went to Mount Hua." (To be continued)</p>
