<p>本報總理史量才先生。前日在滬杭公路慘遭匪徒狙擊。與之江學生鄧君及車夫錦才先後被難。而先生之夫人公子等亦險遭毒手。僅以身免。噩耗傅來。舉國震驚。親戚友好。咸為雪涕。甚至滬上之街頭巷尾。亦多引為談助。蓋不惟因先生夙負時望。感人獨深。亦以案情慘酷。罕有其匹也。同人等追隨先生有年。一旦永訣。史不痛悼。因念死者長逝。飲恨無窮。而噩兇漏綱。逍遙法外。方擬籲請當局從速緝兇破案。明正典刑。藉慰先生等英靈於萬一。而汪院長褚秘書長等唁電飛來。表示業經嚴令緝兇之意。而浙江省政府上海吳市長等。對之亦異常注意。偵騎四出。認真追捕。此先生家屬與同人等之所感激不置者也。</p>
<p>夫滬杭公路為國家交通之孔道。所以便行旅之往來貨物之運輸者也。以其所經各地。悉為江浙精華之區。而有模範公路之目。沿綫固多名城巨鎮。休沐勝地。是以中外人士每日往來於此者。絡繹不絕。今乃不幸而有此駭人聽聞之慘劇。其有不視此模範公路為畏途者幾希乎。吾人試閉目懸想當時之情景。便見在光天化日之下。交通要道之上。有手持利器回目猙獰之匪徒多人。此作最殘忍之暴舉。從容殺人。縱容逸去。觀其膽大妄為。直不知有護路之警士。更無論天理與人道。然則緝兇歸案。處以極刑。所以伸國家之紀綱。亦所以謀行旅之安全也。</p>
<p>佛倡因果輪迴之說。書有天道福善之句。以量才先生宅心之仁慈。努力於社會公益之熱烈。積善立德。宜享壽考。縱不能。亦當壽終正寢。不致橫遭奇禍。然而事實所昭示者竟如此。夫復何言。或者竟如世俗所謂前世之寃孽耶。則事涉飄渺。益不可以究詰矣。特先生既罹不測於生前。當獲伸雪於身後。不然更將何以為善者勸乎。</p>
<p>所堪懸慮者。匪徒既經漏綱。必知善自隱藏。甚或聞風遠颺。正未可知。深願中央與地方當局。再接再厲。從事緝兇。勿以時久而稍懈。勿以地廣而稍疏。誠能使元兇授首。自伏其辜。不惟人心大慰。卽史先生等魂而有知。亦常含笑於九泉也。</p>

<p>美開始向各國建議</p>
<p>訂立軍火管理條約</p>
<p>倫敦美英海軍代表將於今日午後二時三刻集議於相邸、衆料海軍談話將因此而又活動、召集今日會議者係英代表、並未將談話之旨趣通知美方、但請美代表團全體出席、此會重要、由此可以想見、大約英代表將以上星期提交日代表之建議交美方討論之、查日本對此建議迄未有切實答覆、（十四日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦沙善頓海口昨日有擁護現政府之宣傅運動、首相麥唐納蒞會演說、謂政府始終尊重和平、其言曰、和平係一種理想、必須世界各國均皆同意、始能使之實現、關於取締軍火販賣之國際公約、首相謂英國政府有成立國際協定之志望、但由國家專營一層、任何國家均難辦到、英國政府對於販賣軍火採用執照制度行將在日內瓦設法推廣、俾成為普遍辦法、麥氏結論謂、以目前而論、軍備只能任其存在、惟希望能加以縮減、而縮減軍備亦卽日夜努力進行、決不自承失敗者也云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦英相麥唐納在蘇桑普墩演說、略謂十一月十一日、渠立於紀念陣亡將士之碑前、曾以英國必設法使戰爭成為過去事件為誓、英政府積極追求和平、渠日夜籌思軍縮方法、渠決不承認失敗、英政府不許私人軍火廠製造某種用途之軍械、致失業者增多數千人、但在滿洲明事之秋、英國雖主張不以軍火接濟中日、而他國則不允如是、今處理此事之道、在擴大領照制、而使之成為國際辦法、英政府擬於可能的最短時期中、在日內瓦舉辦此事云、（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦英日美三國海軍談話情形、係由英國政府通知各自治領地、本日各自治領駐美高級委員及印度代表在海外自治領地部內、舉行會議由英國政府人員以最近談話形勢、提出詳細報告、大約各代表對於海軍問題、在帝國範圍內之觀點、必曾提出意見云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦英國政府對於華府條約之堅持主張變更從來之見解、而向日本代表團提出妥協試辦方案以來、美國代表團頗覺不滿、故於十四日午後會商、當向英國政府代表提出相當質問、亦未可知、總之、最近日英接近說盛傅、英國境內復有尊重英美親善關係之論調、於是自治領政府代表等人主張英美協調更為美代表團之好材料、且法意兩國政府亦注目於預備會商之經過、倘許日本政府以軍備平等權、則法意兩國亦將立卽主張同等權利、自不待言、故此事甚感困難、海軍預備會商至此、當能料定結局終歸完全失取、但為避免談判破裂之責任起見、直至最後無所提議、僅將一切可能範圍內之提案不惜審議而已、保持此項態度悠然靜觀、而聽其自然結束耳云、（十三日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦關於十四日第三次英美會商之目的、自英國政府申請者並未談及任何情形、美代表團均以突然申請為意外、蓋自英國政府提出試辦方案以來、英美兩國關係頗不甚佳、在英國政府或可根據十三日自治領地代表會議之結果、而能提出解釋以及任何議案、亦未可知、英政府鑑於最近與各國關係頗形複雜、恐惹起誤會、似將極力警戒、故關於英美會商、亦經通告松平大使矣、（十四日日聯電）</p>

<h3 id="c108">米業領袖談本市糧食恐慌 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>沽計存貨今年可保平安渡過</p>
<p>競購洋米但因稅重難以平價</p>
<p>新聲社云、我國本年各地亢旱成災、以致糧食發生空前恐慌、價格飛漲、新聲社記者、昨特往訪本市糧食業領袖顧馨一、蔣石稚。二氏、承發表談話、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>產額減半供不應求</p>
<p>據顧馨一氏對記者稱、本年蘇浙贛皖等省產米區域、因受亢旱影響、致產量銳減、蘇省產額、較往年減色一半、浙省僅四成有畜、贛省亦然、皖較浙贛為佳、平均亦僅有五成收穫、因此該省年有過剩之民食、今年則感覺供不應求之恐慌矣、</p>
<p>訂購洋米百五十萬</p>
<p>因供不應求之故、米業及投機之銀錢業、先後向西貢仰光䢰邏三地、訂購洋米、至目下止、總數已逾一百五十萬包、除進口者二十五萬包外、十一十二兩月進口尚有十五萬包、其馀均為開年上半年之期貨、銷路大宗為浙蘇贛等地辦去、以作防災及軍需之用、滬地銷路、僅屬少數、</p>
<p>旱魃為患稻穗乾癟</p>
<p>江蘇之無錫常熟蘇州松江青浦朱家角。浙江之嘉興寗波嘉善等地、原為產米之區、因久旱之故、加之稻穗乾癟（向例每榖百斤可得米五斗、今因此僅得四斗馀、）收穫又打折擔、致新米上市、可望回跌之價格、堅挺依然、甚且米滬端辦洋米、以防本地應銷之不足、</p>
<p>今年無虞來歲恐慌</p>
<p>顧氏又謂、滬市米價堅挺之原因、主因雖屬亢旱、又以鄉民居奇、往年可罄數脫售者、因此之故、僅售尚數、商號囤積、待善價以估、又減半運滬、此外尚有多數投機份子、儘量收買、操縱市塲、致難回縮、目下滬地銷路、四鄉到貨、尚可相抵、存有洋米十萬石、本米南市三萬石、北市四萬石、本年民食、可保無處、但來歲則難免恐慌、</p>
<p>面粉缺乏成交洋麥</p>
<p>至於面粉、比來因貨少、故價格步昂、華豊面粉廠昨向阿根廷購定洋麥二船、價每百斤四元八角分、離新面粉廠向澳洲訂購一船、價每百斤九元、總數二萬五千噸、澳洲貨約下月二日可裝運到滬、阿根廷貨須明年一月中方能運抵上海、據悉面粉界仍將繼續訂購、以防市塲缺乏、</p>
<p>四鄉底薄不敷半數</p>
<p>又據將石稚對記者稱、四鄉存貨、甚屬單蒞、無錫一地、存陳米十馀萬石、新米十萬石、粳米四萬石、總計江浙兩省現貨、存米一百萬石、（收割者除外）就以兩省產銷論、不敷一半、湘省除應銷外、約馀剩可抵兩省不敷數四分之一、至於皖省亦可馀剩、向出廣東採辦、自大勝關捕收賑米後、皖米運粵、已告絕跡、原因為多估多抽、</p>
<p>粵辦洋米半稅轉滬</p>
<p>蔣氏又謂、至於購辦洋米、滬米業曾要求政府減稅進口未遂、每石計抽收稅餉三元四角、合之成本、出售無利可圖、致米價難以壓平、粵省辦西貢米、當屬僅微半稅、故粵地衆商、狂難洋米、擬轉運來滬、藉得免稅、聞起運在途者、已有十馀萬石、依照本年情形、除江北足資自給外、江南缺額、尚可平安渡過、</p>
<p>調劑民食關鍵在稅</p>
<p>明年米糧、雖尚有百馀萬洋米進口、然以荒區遼闊、亦屬杯水車薪、不敷分配、前途殊感恐慌、設政府能將洋米進口稅、減半或豁免、則米商可儘量訂購洋米、用以壓制本國米糧之恐慌、及調節民食、故明年米糧之缺否、其重要關鍵、全在政府能否豁免及核減云云、</p>

<p>— 范世勤速記。</p>
<p>立法院長孫哲先生生講</p>
<p>六五院制與總統　中央的五院制、在憲法草案中所規定的與現在不同、現在是國民黨組織的政府、現在國民政府的主席是一個元首的地位、實際上是沒有權的、憲法草案所規定的、最高元首是總統、有實際上最高的權力、有人以為總統權力太高、要近乎獨裁、殊不知總統是人民所選舉的、人民有罷免之權、同時立法院操立法權、也不會使總統獨裁的、如其立法權也在總統手裹、那末總統成為集立法行政二權於一身、那纔成為獨裁、或者國會即是總統的國會、像德國那樣、也就變為獨裁了、法治的國家、行政首領如有新的政策、恐怕有什麼妨礙、非要頒布法律不可、如變更預算、就先要經立法院通過、纔能夠實行、否則、不得變更的、其他一切法律也是一樣、不能變更、元首在國家地位上是很高、但還是要經立法院的同意、纔能決定行使、立法院是國家的機關、總統是國家唯一的首領、但他是政策、是應該受國民所擁戴、且經立法院通過、不能說是獨裁政治、</p>
<p>將來憲法成立、行施五權憲法、將來的總統、一定是多數黨的首領、自然也是為人民所擁護、那一個黨既是在國民中占了大多數、那末那一個黨所選出來的總統、人民不會不贊成的、總統的政策是要受立法院的通過、立法院也不會故意和總統為難、總統便可以領導五院做事、卻不是五院受總統的支配、譬如現在我們知道德國和意大利、都是經過不流血的革命、組織政府的、意大利的墨索里尼是法西斯的黨魁、墨索里尼的權雖很大、但他卻不是皇帝、所有power（權力）不在墨索斯蒂的領袖、意大利的政府、是由法西斯蒂所組織、但墨索里尼決定一項政策、也須在國會變通過的在體質上不能算是獨裁（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c157">敬告讀者 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本刋與讀者相見，將近二年，備荷贊助，萬分欣幸。惟念提倡國貨，決非空言可以奏效，更非理想可以推行　同人深覺近來本刋文字，空論多而事實少，冗長多而精警寡，言行未符，意旨未切，自難愜讀者之願望。此後體裁方面，擬稍稍變通，專取調查實際之短文，警開精當之批判，語不憑虛，事有佐證。每篇以四五百字之生動文字而饒有趣味者為合。長篇巨製，空論浮言，概從割愛，並擬增添兩欄，以增與味。</p>
<p>一國貨調查記載　各地國貨產銷情形，及國貨業進展狀況，與人民對於國貨之觀念，分別記述，要言不煩，此項短文，極為歡迎。</p>
<p>二各廠新出產品介紹　各廠所有最近新品，或有特別之點，足為消費者業用，以與外貨抗衡者，倘經惠告，經本刋調查確實，審查合格者，願為披露，以告國人。</p>
<p>此外，照片插盡，亦所歡迎。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>潘洪生志士，以反對奸商販賣化貨，致遭逮捕，備受電刑，卒以逝世。吾人於潘志士出殯之日，目擊各界執紼送喪之盛，綿亙數里之長，認為如潘志士之視死如歸，不顧性命，以與奸商搏，其獃固不可及，然而精神不死，舉市馨香，其榮譽亦不可幾也。保留人間正氣，爭回民族人格，潘志士之死，固大有價值；而於國貨前途，尤增無數之保障，蓋前日送殯聲中，罵奸商無恥，欲得而甘心者，固大有人在。今後販賣仇貨之奸商，心膽毀寒，良心回復，或於改頭換面之倆伎，販賣仇貨之工作，稍稍歛跡。最近懾於鋤奸團之警惕，怵於跪哭團之哀嗚，更當放下屠刀，誕登正路。天下何事不可為？何錢不可賺？定欲汨沒天良，甘冒不韙以販賣仇貨為得計者，必無此理。此則深願犯此者一炯良知，憬然覺悟，庶潘志士之死為不死也。</p>
<p>國貨獻議</p>
<h3 id="c159">建議第一步的同業聯合 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>羣知同業聯合，為救濟現在國貨業一服良劑，顧此問題，實不易解決，既多利害上之衝突，又有人事方面牽連，觀念不同，旨趣各別，其他種種設施，均足為聯合上之障礙，謂其時間未至耶？則國貨業早弄得同類相殘，將成破產局面。謂其個中人尚未覺悟耶？則頻見奔走相告，戚戚以同業不合作，無辦法，歎為不治之疾。蓋人人希望同業聯合，又人人不敢聯合同業。平心而論，創業維艱，自難能輕於舊試，且同行嫉妬四字，數百年來，不但成為工商界一種定名，抑且成為定局，影象太壞，消滅非易，於是此項同業聯合問題，始終成為一件懸案，徒存空論，無法實施，對癥發藥，自當先行解釋兩方懷疑之點，因勢導利，由漸而來，乃有第一步的同業聯合建議。</p>
<p>一採辦聯合　工廠採辦原料，或消耗品時，凡屬躉購者，當然較零批為便宜，我廠所需用者，同業各廠，亦無不需用之，此可以聯合也，卽使數量不同，是可照比例分攤，往者同一貨品也，甲廠與乙廠不同，今年出品與去年又不同，更有初次之品，與二次又不同，其故安在？大都由採辦原料時，八方拚湊，毫無標準化耳。如此，不但原料便宜，或本低下，設有大批定貨送出，決不致以其有異當初樣子貨，而受人退回，籍此亦可免除同業間之競賣，而對於國貨推銷前途，關係尤大。</p>
<p>二堆棧聯合　工廠堆棧，原係儲藏生熟貨，一若銀錢業之庫房，關係何等重大，同業各廠廠址，未必鄰近一處，亦無鄰近一處之必要。至堆棧棧址，須擇鬧中取靜，水陸交通便利，消防周密，房屋合式，管理穩妥，設各廠各棧，未必房屋均能適用，亦覺太不經濟，好在彼此生熟貨。同屬一類，既無秘密不公開之理，何不彙集一處，可得許多利益。萬一金融上發生不能周轉時，向銀行抵押，亦可得許多便利，他若保險可共保，職員可公用，運貨汽車船只可合置等等，不但可促進同業營業上之聯合，藉此可節省各廠許多經濟精神。</p>
<p>三外埠分發行所聯合　各廠外埠分發行所之營業，大都以門市為主，卽有利害上之衝突，亦比較少小，設無當地同業，更毋庸其競賣，旣勿競賣，又如何不可聯合，蓋既無關銷額，反得節省許多開支，設有當地同業，尤當聯合。始此則力量既宏，優劣自見，同鄉人異地則親。況同業耶？</p>
<p>四生產聯合　所謂生產聯合者，卽限止生產之謂也，物稀則貴，多則賤，近年海上各業國貨工廠之所以拚命貶價競賣，不顧血本者，均起因於出品之過剩，病原所在，是宜對癥投藥，請各安毋躁，在可能範圍內，各自限止生產，如得地方政府助力，出而統制，尤稱公允，我國貨尚不能以外國為傾銷塲，卽使薄利多賣，同屬國民經濟，徒見其貪得無壓，為欲把持一業想耶？</p>
<p>五客戶聯合　比年市況彫零，客戶之相繼倒閉者，層見疊出，往往一小客戶，而被倒至十數萬金，一業之中，竟被倒至十萬或八萬金者，推原其由，大都係同業不聯合所致，設某客戶欠我三千金，似乎可以信任，安知同業十家中，他更各欠三千金矣，人作我想，均以為可以信任，一旦倒閉，則悔恨無及，設欲於平時互相探詢，則在同業營業未聯合之先，事實上，萬難做到，蓋秘密之不暇，而人棄我取，尤為出品過剩時代之營業法，今擬於該客戶之應收帳欵期，而未曾收到，或故意延付，或已付之期票，到期退回者，則該客戶，已非好客戶可知，應將該戶戶名，及被欠數目，通知同業，使咸注意。</p>
<p>六賽會聯合　遇各地方舉行展覽會時，同業各廠，各選精品，共同參加。既足表現一業精神，集思廣益。定能博得精彩不少，至平時亦可擇期舉行同業出品展覽會，以比較工藝上之高下，如最近家庭工業社，舉行之化妝品展覽會，仰葊先生稱之謂同業合作之發軔，洵係名言。</p>
<p>七臨時聯合　近年熱心國貨者，對於勸用國貨，可謂不遺馀力，各地舉行之國貨臨時商塲，無時間斷，凡遇此項營業加入時，均應同業共同加入，當加入之先。自己先行集業中人或技術專家評定貨品，估定價目，公平交易，任人選購，待至臨時商塲或有時終了後，同業亦可單獨一業舉行，卽至時出品或有時過剩，亦不難使其求過於供也，如此一一聯合起來，則同業聯合營業，庶幾乎近之矣。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c160">提倡國貨的根本辦法 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>除出一部份專門醉心歐化，衣，食，住，行，均非洋不用的摩登青年，果然是喪心病狂，罪不容恕。至於其馀大部份同胞採用洋貨的心理，我相信雖則也有少數是崇拜洋貨，甘心利源外溢：但是中國工商業落後，沒有相當代替品的供給，也是無可為諱的！</p>
<p>不信，在幾年前流行我國社會上的牙粉，不都是金剛石，獅子牌等日貨嗎？當時尤其是金剛石牙粉，差不多鄉愚婦孺咸知，於此可知其流傅我國歷史之悠久和普遍了！但是近年來家庭工業社的無敵牙粉，牙膏，中國化學社的三星牙膏，品性優良，後來居上，仇貨牙粉，就不用抵制而受到天然的淘汰了。</p>
<p>還有家庭烹飪所必需的調味品類，從前也只有仇貨［味之素］暢銷市塲，現在已給天廚廠的味精，中國化學社的味生，奪了他的地位，日貨的［味之素］差不多已絕跡市塲了！</p>
<p>由上面兩個顯著的例子，我們就可以知道我國的國民，並不是一定愛用洋貨，實在因為在本國還沒有相當的代替品罷了！</p>
<p>報章宣傅，集會演講，等等的提倡國貨運動，我以為都是治標的辦法，只有國人仿造舶來品，改良國貨以代替外貨，那方是治本的妙法，到這時有了完美的國貨，民衆不需要你去宣傅勸用，他們自會樂於購買的，終究中國國民眼光是淺狹的，國家觀念更其十分淡漠，除非有實際代替品的供給，國貨運動的前途，是終難得到光明的！</p>
<p>不過謀國貨代替品，正也不是一件易事，我們這種窮小子是無能為力的。這一定要一般實業家去努力，同時政府對於國貨工廠也當特別的維護，督促勉勵他去生產與改良。牙粉，味精，在我國產物中正如滄海一粟，其馀一切的外貨，都需要國貨來代替。我在這裹竭誠的希望一般實業家，努力地向前做去！［牙粉］［味精］就是你們的一個良好例子！努力罷！一定有相當的收穫！</p>
<h3 id="c161">一個消滅洋信封箋的有效辦法 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 禇劍屏</p>
<p>我的同學秦君，是郵局職員中的老資格了。昨天他告訴我一椿一情，雖然不免得有些促狹，但是立於提倡國貨的陣壘上說起來，卻是很爽快的。</p>
<p>秦君說：［中國人喜用洋貨的迷信，至今還沒有稍減，這是在我們經手的郵件上。可以看得出的。不敢說謊！一包郵件之中，至少有百封以上。是純粹的洋信封，紅紅綠綠，宛似書寓的卡片；有些還要肉而麻之的，灑上些巴黎香水，真所謂極盡魘子之能事了，因此，我預先刻了一個木質圖章，文曰：［此係洋貨信封，用者應知自羞］，揀著一封封的洋貨信封上，逐一加蓋一下，好讓收信人通知寄信人改過，我想這是很有效力的吧！］</p>
<p>我聽了秦君的話，很佩服他的熱心和勇敢，所以寫了出來，警告一下全國的同胞們，不要再自取其辱了。同時還得忠告一下我們的筆桿同志，以後你們寫國貨週刋的文字，千定不要用洋信封紙，否則你的大作，無論寫得怎麼好，編輯先生卻不能割愛，而投入字紙簏裹去哩！</p>

<h3 id="c204">元朝的西湖畫舫 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>一提起［西湖畫舫］，不由的就要使人神往於六橋三竺間了。按一個西湖，自宋以來，常為人所　稱；因西湖而聯想及畫舫，自是意中之事。所以古人描寫西湖，總要把它－畫舫－形諸筆墨的，其例甚多，不勝錄。</p>
<p>現在西湖畫舫，大家都知道有大小二種。小者就是劃了，頭尾皆銳，上遮布幔，居中兩旁界以銅闌或藤闌，其中則設有藤桌椅，布置較簡。大者則形如蘇州之快船，旁開窗牑，金碧輝煌；中可容多人。近來畫舫的體製如是。至於古時畫舫的式樣如何，則因畫鮮紀載，故多不可考了。</p>
<p>偶閱元人張伯雨貞居詞，中有一首［太常引］，讀之頗可考見當時畫舫的體製。有題云：</p>
<p>［漫翁新製畫舫湖中，予為名其舫曰浮家泛宅。翁姓李，字仁仲，湖船用布帆，自李始。］再錄全詞如下：</p>
<p>［莫將西子比西湖，千古一陶朱；生怕在樓居，也用著風帆短蒲。銀瓶索酒，并刀斫鱛，船背錦糢糊。堤上早傅呼：［那個是煙波釣徒？］</p>
<p>［湖船用布帆，自李始。］從這，我們可以考見元朝以前的西湖畫舫也是不用帆的，并且還可證明［自李始］而後，湖船用帆的一定很多。曰［浮家泛宅］，則其船之大可知。曰［索酒］曰［斫鱛］，則可以想見船中可以張筵設席，聚客豪飲。從［船背錦糢糊］句推想，更可以知道那時的湖船，亦必旁開窗牑，并且船中的陳設，一定是很富麗的。［傅呼］云云，堤上游人之衆，亦可不言而喻。</p>
<p>我因此想，如果現在西湖畫舫能用布帆，則風帆點點，湖中將益見幽雋。不過船家如要供奉祖師，那末自然要推那元朝的李老頭兒了。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>到法院裹去聽審，這是生平第一遭。</p>
<p>是一個秋末的早上，為了要增加些見聞起見，於是便和同事章君，趨車至特區法院，做一次旁聽的來賓。</p>
<p>索了旁聽劵，便坐在第二法庭上，等候那審判的開始，在沒有審判的當見，我環顧各色各樣旁聽的人，覺得有的是愁容滿面，好像有無限的心事，湧上心來，有的是侃侃而談，在討論如何應付法官的問答，這裹，所有的一切，好像都肅靜似的，露出了這法庭的尊嚴。</p>
<p>開審了，大家對法官行了一個禮，便坐下來聽著！我坐了二個多鐘頭，覺得所審判到的人，都是面有饑色黃皮瘦骨的貴國的同胞，而所審到的案子，也幾乎完全是行竊等等案情，這裹，確實給予我心靈上一個很大的刺激。</p>
<p>我不忍再聽下去了，便和章君退了出來，在歸途上，我心中默默地想著：［這可憐的同胞，社會應如何的去救濟他們呀，消極的制裁，終覺得無補於事，甚望社會當局者，對此轉轉念頭呢？］</p>

<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>兒童，是未來的國家主人翁，它的長成，從哺乳，以至脫離襁褓，施受教育，而到逹為社會有務，為國家謀福利的各個時期，是完全需要它的父，母，師長，和良友教養與啟導的。</p>
<p>但是，怎樣教養兒童呢？文法是依賴手段的嗎？這都是極重要的小問題。</p>
<p>譬如：做父，母的怎樣教養他們的孩子、溺愛嗎？那結果是等於殺害了那小孩子的靈魂，嚴厲的管束嗎？孩子是帶有天真，活潑，倔強的各個性情的，是不是肯輕言受教？那麼，怎樣使它由醜惡，暴戾，而變成善良的呢？</p>
<p>明白的啟示是極需要的，若果孩子走錯了路，就得一把拉回來呌他重走，必須走的是光明的大道，哄騙是不適宜的，溺愛是更要不得，應該處罰的時候，就應該給他一個嚴重的教訓，媽媽虎虎徇情，縱愛是無異子含有重量毒液而能葬送孩子們的一生。</p>
<p>最近，聽說新光正映著的那［婦導］影片，曾經獲得兒童幸福會的褒獎，其於孩子們的教養問題，很有極透澈的暴露，願天下為父母者不可不往一看。</p>

<p>馬路上往來車馬，在外國我不知道，不敢多說。在中國大的都是靠左邊走，不靠右邊走，靠右邊走的，只有青島一處了。</p>
<p>青島馬路上的往來車馬，為什麼要靠右邊走，卻沒人能夠答復。據說在未接收以前，已是如此，未接收以前，是日本人管理，日本人管理期中，也是如此。日本人以前，是德國人管理，德國人管理期中，就是靠右邊走。那麼這個辦法，相沿已久了。</p>
<p>可是現在青島市公安局，已實行通令，所有全市車輛，馬匹，行人，自本年十月一日起，一律改靠左邊走。行人不遵這個辦法，死了是活該，車輛不遵這個辦法，便受罰處罪。</p>
<p>中國人對於左右兩方，本來就有一種高下分別。祇人家請客，飯時必讓客人坐在左方，舊式結婚，新郎新婦，雙雙交拜時，男的也站在左方。既然如此，在馬路上走路，自然也須從左邊走去，從左邊走去，便有一種向上的意思。</p>
<p>青島市公安局，打破幾十年的習慣。從右面走改由左而走，大概也是這個心理吧。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在列車上的那座小朝廷裹，太后的御座是特地定製的：但在盛京的宮院中，卻儘有幾座現存的備著，不必另製。雖然它們的彫刻和裝璜，因為年代久，不常用的緣故，已遠不如北京宮裹所有的精緻而富麗，可是現在安在便殿上的那一座，也還並不怎樣陳舊，它的質料，一般也是用的紫檀木，後面也一樣有一架紫檀木的插屏，鑲著很名貴的大理石。</p>
<p>四面的墻上，跟火車的車壁上一般也有大福的圖案畫繪著，這些壁畫的作者，當然又是那些高手的漆工了。他們所畫的人物或花草，都歡喜用很濃艷的顏色，看起來不免覺得太粗俗些。</p>
<p>就這一座正殿來講，或者可以說把這一座正殿來代表了盛京全部的宮院而論，它們誠然是很燦爛輝煌：然而若把熱河的行宮來比較一下，那就不免處處相形見絀了！我不妨舉出幾點來，當做說明。譬如墻壁上，這裹祇是漆著許多壁畫，鮮艷固然很鮮艷，但怎樣夠得上說珍貴，說別緻呢？在熱河的行宮中，有好幾座為聖駕所常到的殿字，是用各色各樣的貢緞來糊壁的：這些貢緞上，一般也織著很美麗的圖案畫。他們的價值，至少要比油漆超出十倍二十倍。還有，在熱河的行宮中，太后每次去留宿的幾座正殿裹，所有幾枝粗可合抱的庭枉上，從頭到腳，都有許多栩栩如生的飛龍盤繞著：它們既不是用木塑成的，也不是用泥彫就的，原來它們全是用金所澆鑄的。（一七四）</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>崑山在我的憧憬裹，並不怎樣的深刻。那天我和瘦鵑小青們，看了青陽港的菊花以後，到了崑山，覺得比蘇州的虎邱，更平凡些。可是趁著夕陽還沒有跌下地平綫去，晚色還能給我們留戀風光，怱怱的到半繭園去一回，這卻使我至今還有些依依這情呢。</p>
<p>半繭園在明代，名繭園，是葉氏所有，有六十畝的面積。清初分而為三，姓仲的三分之一，便稱他半繭。可是現在我估量去，連二十畝也沒有了。因了整理會的善於布劃，所以並不嫌他小，三間敞軒，可以品茗，可以會飲，有無綫電播音，從壁間悠揚地傅出來。對面小阜上，聳起一塊玲瓏的太湖石，比蘇州留園的冠雲峯，果然矮了一截，卻也有悠久的歷史。原來他是宋代揚州王忠玉家快哉亭前故物，有蘇東坡的題識。元代顧得暉從通圖橋新安尼寺裹得到的。清嘉麼八年，方綫移到園裹來。這塊石頭名［寒翠］，題得很蓓麗，差不多當他是少女了。</p>
<p>說起少女，卻在壁上瞧見顧天熙的一首詩了，</p>
<p>［風馬逐雲麾，神仙事轉疑，明璫瑩翠羽霧榖映璚姿；洛浦驚鴻貌，陳王刻骨辭，殷勤勞夢寐，縹緲託相思。］</p>
<p>他的跋語說，從前這園襄有花神像，面目甚艷，現在沒有了，因此他很涉遐思。我到了這裹，讀了這時，也感到一點什麼似的，做了一首詩替他轉語：</p>
<p>［為看寒翠石嶙峋，殘照秋英半繭新，恰有吳歌來天際，不須相思託花神。］</p>
<p>在東面，有一道女墻，矮矮地卻巧可以依憑著遙望，誰知遙望還不如近矚，那墻外有一道清溪，對岸正有一個漁人，安詳地坐在那裹扳罾。他的背後，有參差的野樹，和黃綠相雜的半疇，遠處還櫬著明媚的晚霞，形成一幅有生命的圖畫。可惜夜色絕不留情地把我們趕出園去，不許我們再得到一點趣味。但是也可以說，正為了怱怱的來去，還能使我至今有些依依之情呢。</p>
<p>蘇州的園林，可算得多啦，些微有一點名望的，我都到過，可是都不及半繭園的嬌小玲瓏，尤其是有自然的襯託和渲染。我們覺得這種小型的園林，是最合小城市的布置。同時更感到蘇州有許多園林，還得經過一番整理，像半繭整理會，把城市裹片斷的古物，都收集了放在園裹，有的就利用他做坐具，這樣一木一石，都得了他們適當的地位了。這一點，我也覺得可以給古物保存者和建設裹業者一個參考。</p>

<h3 id="c212">我們所需要的譯本 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 苗埒</p>
<p>翻譯今年的確是盛行了。先是［文學］接連出了兩期翻譯專號，接著［譯文］和［世界文學］便應運而生，［現代］也出了一期美國文學專號來湊熱鬧。素來被人目為媒婆不甚注意的翻譯，居然也有出頭的機會，這實在不能不說是一種可喜的現象。</p>
<p>不過這其間，稍稍令人感到一些不滿的，是所有的譯文大都是短篇，篇幅稍長的竟一篇都沒有。而且這些短篇裹里，有幾篇很面熟，好像在那裹見過似的，打開舊雜誌來一查，往往可以查著。固然，我們並不反對一篇作品的一譯再譯，因為從兩篇不同的譯文上，常可比較出譯筆的優劣來，可是發現得太多了，也不免要使人覺得能力浪費的可惜。</p>
<p>對於近來翻譯界的多短篇而少長篇，自有其物質上的原因，我們不能埋怨譯人。因為譯人也是人，需要物質來維持生活，在這出版界不景氣單行本寥落的年頭，長篇譯本翻譯既費時間，譯成後又不容易找到出路，正所謂［頂著石臼作戲，吃力不討好。］為了解決物質生活起見，譯人們當然只有羣趨於翻譯短篇的一條路了。</p>
<p>然而在青年的創作修養上打算，長篇譯本卻是非常需要的。近來文壇上正鬧著何以沒有偉大作品產生的問題，而觀察一般青年作家的作品，卻多數不免於淺薄空疎之弊，往往有了很好的主題和材料，只因沒有描寫的技巧，便不免於失敗。如若能把外國名家的作品盡量迻譯過來，使他們得以觀摩借鏡，明瞭怎樣布局怎樣描寫纔能令人感動，我相信，在我們荒蕪的文藝圈裹，一定會勃然怒發幾株奇葩的。</p>
<p>那麼，我們現在所需要的到底是怎樣的譯本呢？</p>
<p>恕我大膽的說一句：我們所需要的很多。不論是古代的，現代的，只要列於世界文學名著之林允當而無愧色又為我們所沒有譯本的，風們都需要。</p>
<p>關於古代的，荷馬（homer）的兩部史詩，［奧德賽］（odyssey）已有傅東華先生譯本，但［伊利亞特］（lfiad）卻還沒有譯本出現，我們需要［伊利亞特］。此外，希臘三大悲劇作家的作品，雖多半已經散佚，但流傅於世的也不少，我們都希望能有一讀的機會。還有，羅馬大詩人魏琪爾（virgil）的［伊泥易德］，（aemeid）從前小說月報上曾譯載過一部分，我們也希望能有全譯本出現。</p>
<p>關於文藝復興時代的，西萬提司（cerreantes）的［唐。吉訶德］（don　quixate）全譯本，我們實在需要得比不論那一種著作都迫切。因為在現代青年間，羅亭型哈孟雷特型巴札洛夫型唐。吉訶德型等名詞是很流行的。前三種都已有了譯本，後一種卻只有一部文言的［魔俠傅］，實不足饜我們讀者之望。還有，莎士比亞（shahespea）的六大悲劇，除了［哈孟雷特］（hamhlet）［麥克白］（macbeth）［羅蜜歐和朱麗葉］（rameo　and　juliet）三種已有譯本外，其他如［奧塞洛］（othello）［朱里。凱撒］（julius　cassar）［安東尼和克麗亞巴特拉］（antony　and　cle　opatra）還都沒有譯本，希望有人能出頭來完成這工作。</p>
<p>十七十八世紀時代的作品，雖已不大合我們的口味，但其中有幾部名著，如密爾頓（milton）的［得樂園］（paradise　regained）彭揚（bunyan）的［天路歷程］（the　pilgrim　s　prlgress）理查得孫（richa　rdson）的［巴米拉］（pamela）費爾丁（filding）的［湯姆。瓊士］（tom　jones）高爾斯密士（goldsmith）的［威克斐牧師傅］（the　vicar　of　wakefield）等，也頗望能有人譯出來給我們一讀。</p>
<p>十九世紀的名著非常多，而這些名著又多半沒有中譯本，如若要全部例舉出來，決非短短的篇幅所能容納，這里只能約略的說一些。在英國，我們需要史各德的［華委萊小說］，（waverleynovels）狄更司（didkens）的［二城記］，(atales　of　two　cities）哈代（hardy）的［無名的裘特］，（jude　the　obscurc）拜倫（byron）的［唐。瓊］（dan　jnan）等。在法國，我們需要巴爾扎克（balzac）的［人間喜劇］。（cemedie　humaine）左拉（zala）的［洛根。瑪加爾叢書］（romgon　macquart）等。在俄國。我們需要龔察洛夫（gontcharare）的［阿蒲洛摩夫］，（oblomare）杜斯退夫斯基（dostseresky）的［卡拉瑪淑夫兄弟］（the　brothers　karamazore）等。在德國，我們需要歌德（goethe）［浮士德］（faust）第二巷，霍甫德曼（hauftman）的［孤獨的人］（eilsame　menschen）等。在美國，我們需要歐文（lrving）的［奸細］，（the　spy）霍桑（hamtharne）的［紅字］，（the　scarlmsun）的［淺士］，（shallare　soil）意大利鄧南遮（d　annunzio）的［火］（fire）等，也是我們所急需一讀的。</p>
<p>至於近代名著，如蕭伯納的戲劇，高爾基辛克萊以及新俄作家的小說，被介紹過來的雖已不少，但長篇鉅製如羅曼羅蘭（romain　rolland）的［若望。克利斯朶夫］，（jean　christophe）高爾斯華綏（galswarthy）的［福西脫］（farsyte）等，卻還有待於譯人們的繼續努力。</p>
<p>我並不是個名人，更沒有膽量敢代青年開書目，這里所列的一些，只是我個人感覺比較需要的而已，雖然也許可以代表一部分人的意見。</p>

<p>從尚逹的市梢突出之後，車便不住地開足速力在森林的巷道奔竄了。因為路上的行人除限於村市和植物園的住宅區之外，是幾乎斷絕人跡的，兩車夫又心急著回歸他的住處，所以車是開足所能的速率了。沿途是只見一片白色的天和暗綠色的樹影在飛馳，或偶然一幾輛雜色的汽車相擦而過之外，是看不見什麼的。</p>
<p>從萬叨榴槤登車之後，連還照昨日的速度行駛，而所見的景物也差不了多少。人一在赤道的森森的巷道間奔走慣了，人是會起著錯覺：以為世界上除這載自己的車子在猛烈滾動之外，世界是完全死息了的。</p>
<p>然而車將近琳琪拉瑪的時候，情形卻有點異樣。車剛從一家美國的大實業家的橡皮園穿過，一行一行像鴿籠般平躺著的工人住宅區才過去，那屋子門外爪哇工婦的［紗籠］曬在門外受著風吹動便像旗子船的影象還未被忘卻，車卻爬上一個小小的山丘了。因為橡皮樹種植未久，車一登上這山丘的頂上的時候，從底下的低矮的樹叢上一眼望過去，便望見一個赤道地帶上從未見過的境界。眼前是低低的樹叢直逹眼界綫，赤陽在天上蒸曬，村叢做著　　的波動，看起來像置身於大沙漠上。汽車大道在這赤色的園地上蜿蜒地躺臥，卻像沙漠上旅人和駱駝隊所留下來的足跡。</p>
<p>過這小小的只有幾家小店的園市的時候，中國夥計們和爪哇工人們向著汽車略略張望，車便輕輕地吻過了。而一幅用著白布子寫著烏黑的中國字的［ＸＸ園坵中華學校］的招牌卻在一間小小的木屋子前顯示出來。這事情使我異常高興，我是深悉在工友們和小商人間創建華僑童校的困難的；而在這麼小的地方，有這麼簡陋的華僑小學顯現出來，真是令人增加熱氣不少。</p>
<p>車一走出廣大的園地，（足足用了一個多鐘頭，據說後來這園地的裁工曾使工人們引起小小的騷動，因為工人是異常衆多而大多數被解雇的緣故。）不久便到連琳琪拉瑪。</p>

<p>－留日生活斷片之一－</p>
<p>首先，我得先來介紹我們這一羣，我們這一羣一共四個人，三個都帶點野性的人，只有一個比較正經一點的，就是因為這樣，我們都喊她［大姊］，實際上，她的年齡也比我們大得很多。我們四個人第一個是Ｒ。Ｙ。，第二個是曼波，她以前也曾在軍隊裹混過一些日子，</p>
<p>有的時候，她更比Ｂ。Ｙ。野，第三個是［大姊］，第四個就是我。因為她們都是女性，只有我一個人是例外，所以我們這一羣是女子執政權的。</p>
<p>現在要說到我們自己燒飯的動機了。因為我們是同住在一個下宿裹，又在同一個學校，大家都覺得菜館裹的飯菜不好吃，而且又化錢，自己燒又經濟又好吃，于是大家就注意自己燒飯了。</p>
<p>是在一星期前的一天早上，我們開了一個伙食會議，議決要案如下：一經費每人每月拿出九元，如下夠再酌量增加：二四個人分為二組，每天由一組的人管理買菜，洗米，燒飯，洗碗筷等之工作；三午餐在上午十一時，晚餐在下午六時；四不能單買自己歡喜吃的菜。這議決案是從燒飯那一天開始執行。</p>
<p>現在，我們過著自炊的生活已有一星期了。天天總是愉快的工作著，愉快的吃著，朋友們都羨幕著我們的生活，也羨幕我們燒的菜，所以常常有朋友來吃飯。曼燒的菜滋味極好，真是一個老手，只是太糟了，她吹牛，她說她以前在長沙時曾自己燒過九個月飯，她能夠燒得很好的菜，可是事實告訴我們，她燒的菜最不好吃，常常把牛肉燒得像塊布，我笑她，我說：［你只會寫小說，燒菜你是下手的，你該再做三年學徒才行。］然而她否認，她不是說今天的火太大，就是說今天忘記了放醬油。</p>
<p>昨天晚上又是輪著曼波燒菜，恰巧王瑩來我們這裹，我們留她吃飯，她說：［好！］于是我們再買了點菜，又再買了些面，昨晚的菜實在燒得不錯，這是大家公認的，在席間，王瑩說：［我天天吃那不合口胃的日本菜，苦極了，我就天天感到身在異國，今晚吃了這菜，就感到好像是在國內了。］</p>
<p>我們大家又商量在過新年的時候，應當大吃一頓，王瑩提議要買很多酒來，我提議至少要買二個雞，而　提議要殺一條豬，這真夠把我們笑痛了肚皮。我們每個人的年紀也不很小了，而且也曾經在社會上做過一點事情，學會了一副［世故］的面孔，然而，和朋友一塊時，大家都捧出一個純潔的童心來，又像小孩子似的了。</p>
<p>我相信我們這樣生活下去是會胖起來的，而且又是不負什麼責任的學生時代呢。</p>

<p>［魚長大了還能吃，可是，人！人哪，只好爛掉。］</p>
<p>他不理會撒綱者和橋上的行人在向他諷嘲的笑，淚在那枯澀的頰邊爍動。他的名字也就由［香莩］擴大到［騙子］，［良心］……至於［騙子］是譴責［香莩］他自己，或其他人，人們從未關心到這方面。</p>
<p>他帶著老年的疲倦，一回到客店裹就熱鬧了。小二花梢著跳來跳去，像一匹小狗歡迎著他的主人；親惹的扭他的膀子。他躱來閃去，現在不耐煩的神色，絕不是生氣。小二懂得，現在無事可做，－－他夜間既不看戲，又不賭博，晚上睡覺之前就只喝酒。</p>
<p>關於喝酒，小二說得好：</p>
<p>［不嫖不賭再不喝酒，一個人作甚麼呢。至多不過百年，四季躺在夾魚板下，熬著熬著，一死好，吹灰！］可是看看［香莩］漸漸紫漲的臉，馬上也會換過輪調，悽楚的說：［老朋友，應該回頭了！年青天邊一條命。天下怕地不怕。可是老了，也該略許防防後。］</p>

<p>［香莩］也懂得這話在人與人之間的重量，可是他不能把忠言當催眠歌。有次小二和他鬧別拗，不送上酒來，整整一夜重病臨身似的，像一個鴉片痛者呻吟著，淚都淌出來了。其實那苦楚是在想像以上的。一個人，只是一個人，從出生經過無限凌辱。這凌辱日月積著到五六十歲，已經有了載不起的重量。回過頭去罷。可憟的往事像交錯的港汷，像璀起黑浪的海。怎麼挃得過，那無崖的滿披黑毛的夜？除了吃酒。否則，還是死了的好。</p>
<p>［不喝酒，罪孽比海還深哪！］</p>
<p>有這麼一句名言。設使罪愆的深淺是以受苦的多少為準，這話是不錯的。他信為真理。</p>
<p>他低頭用筷子敲擊桌面，發出不快的油膩的聲音。這是支小調，在靜靜泛青色的淮水上，到處可以聽到，快樂中夾雜著悲涼的曲子。起先很有節拍，無如時間一長，恰好像那些小曲調本身，就混雜了。</p>

<h3 id="c217">談［標榜］與［相輕］ <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 淡然</p>
<p>現代文人接受了前代文人的遺產，卻也同時接受了前代文人許多的特性。</p>
<p>前代文人的特性很多，而在前代文人間最普遍地存在著，經現代文人接受後又更能演化的特性恐怕要推［標榜］與［相輕］了。</p>
<p>文人為什麼要標榜，要相輕呢？我們在論爭一類的文章裹面可以歸納出幾個原因來：［標榜］的原因是由於［道德文章，俱所心折，］［芝蘭之臭味相投；］［相輕］的原因是由於［不學無術，］［不甘同流合污。］其實這都是些表面的話，骨子裹倒不一定是這回事。歸根結底的說，卻不外［自我］作崇，上焉者不免［瞎子摸象，］固執已見：下焉者卻完全是熱中［名］的追求。</p>
<p>本來我國古來的文人很少將書本子和實生活結婚的。四庫全書裹面便難得找到［經世文編］這一類書籍的地位，於是文人便都成為一些滿蓄方巾氣的書獃子。只要私淑了某幾個古人或某幾部典籍便［刻舟求劍，］固守一隅。如是你摸到了一隻象腿，便振振有詞；我摸到了一隻象鼻，便旗當鼓對了。由於方巾氣的傲慢性，便要大拉同類，互相［標榜，］來大鬧一塲，［相罵無好話，］彼此［相輕］自是必然的事，這還是上焉者。</p>
<p>最要不得而又最為一般文人的通病的特性，要算是熱中於［名］的追求這一類了。</p>
<p>本來［名利］二字是我國自古以來人生的標識。也許是因為［利］字太俗了些，古來文人對於［名］的熱中要算是特別厲害，像現在的所謂［登龍］一樣，首先總全在［名］的取得。必須先有了［名］，才能拿去作一切企圖的敲門磚，所以［名］便成了文人的第一意義。</p>
<p>因為［自我］的［名］作果，除了拿出［貨色］來以外，便不得不使些手段。［標榜］與［相輕］便是［不二法門。］［標榜］可以自成堡壘，攜手［登龍，］算是得了，［互助學說］的三味。［相輕］卻是，［敵人相見，分外眼紅，］非混戰三十回合，見個高低不可了，這或者就是逹爾文的［進化論］吧。</p>
<p>於是乎［文人無行］成了一般觀者的通評。</p>
<p>最高無上的法寶還是赤祼裸地將［貨色］獻給觀衆，［旁觀者清，］觀衆是不會分不出黑白的，［標榜］與［相輕］似乎都不是正當的途徑。</p>
<h3 id="c218">賣花女 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— ＴＴ</p>
<p>賣花女翠兒，每天清早，她的呌賣花的聲音，老是要在我的寓所的門前纏繞。</p>
<p>聲音是尖細的，清幽而略帶幾分悲涼。每當那麼地悲涼的聲音，敵動著我的耳膜的時候，我的心裹頭有時便會感到微微地辛酸；近了窗邊，打開窗扇，往下望一望，問她道：</p>
<p>［翠兒，生意好吧？］</p>
<p>［還不算壞，先生。］她總是這麼地應著，隨卽又呌賣起來，她一刻也不敢放鬆她的生意，她滿望著一筐生花，會跟著她的聲音，而驟變為一枚一枚的銅板。</p>
<p>她挨門的呌著，呌著，要是她的聲音，在那一家的門前響著，而大門或後門忽然會內開來的話，那她那一張銀紙色的瘦臉，不消說立刻就會掠過了一陣微笑。搶上前，接著便是太太，先生，小姐這一串的話，不斷地從她的嘴裹衝出來，態度是那麼地誠懇，那麼地可憐。</p>
<p>她經常是這樣的，就是雨天也不曾停歇過，因此，在我的寓所的鄰近的人們，也就是漸漸地熟識了她，尤其是我，對於她，我自信比旁人更加深識，這并不是我跟她交易的次數多，實在倒是我眼看著她對於本身的事業的動謹，生起了愛慕和同情，所以也就時常跟她談話，有時買她一二枝花，自然也就沒曾計較過價錢，她也似乎認為我是一個值得</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>她把蘊藏在內心的事情吐露出來的人。</p>
<p>這樣，我便知道她祇有一位母親。父親在她二三歲的時候，就死去了的，母親辛辛苦苦地養活她，現在可就不能了，她不能靠著她的母親了，母親因為勞作過度，身體弄壞了，病魔老是不肯離開她一步。</p>
<p>一天早上，我正在熟睡，驀地，篤篤篤的響聲，把我呌醒來，翹著耳朶靜聽，立刻我發覺有人在敲門，原來翠兒站在門口垂淚。她呌一聲先生，接著便嗚咽地哭起來。</p>
<p>［什麼事體呢？］我驚奇地問道。</p>
<p>她這才收住了哭聲，遲緩地說：</p>
<p>［先生，請你做件好事，給我幾毛錢。］</p>
<p>［好的，可是哭什麼呢？］</p>
<p>［媽的樣子不大好。］她忍不住又哭起來。</p>
<p>我把身上僅存的幾毛錢拿把她。她接過了手，趕快地走下樓去。</p>
<p>以後，聽不見她的呌賣花的聲調了，這其間的緣故，我連猜都不敢去猜它。</p>

<p>上海，爾在向人嘲弄，在向人迷惑的喲！</p>
<p>紅的，綠的，白的，……一切明媚的燈光偉美人的眼睛一樣明媚，迷惑了多少少年喲！</p>
<p>騷音，雜器之聲。怎樣迷離而撓亂人間的神經之安寗呀！</p>
<p>壯嚴而高高的大廈和那金字塔爭勞！這，使人們憶起了已死了的奴地隸時代的金字塔之偉大不朽，萬里長城之永垂千古！羅馬的宮殿之輝煌的燈光照耀著了西方的文化不會熄滅。</p>
<p>但是喲，爾那大廈尖頂上的燈光之閃爍，是那賃銀奴隸的英雄仙底靈光！</p>

<p>哦，誰說這兒是醜態的呢？爾臉上不是已粉上了奪目的色粉，抹上了口紅，爾的身上已布上了美麗的羅紗衣裳嗎？</p>
<p>呵，美麗喲！爾會用了爾的一切技能來整飾了爾的一切醜態了。</p>
<p>我的智慧在這兒生長，這兒是我的第三故鄉。</p>
<p>我曾在那黃浦江，頭送客，為著那客人而流過了別離之淚！</p>
<p>啊啊，我們昔年離別的時候也是這麼的一個瀟瀟落葉漂在江心。</p>
<p>但而今，黃浦江頭尤依然，江水空自流。而今客人那裹去了？呵，爾可能知道他的消息？</p>
<p>空惆悵，憶短長，落葉依故樣。</p>
<p>然而喲，我今兒的心已不緣從前很樣的柔弱。</p>
<p>我記起那客人曾說過：請看那江心的流波：一波一波復一波，這末的船兒在波心衝過：船兒雖遭了波折，但船身依然無恙。祇是你是向前進就不會發什麼危險！不然，那你不前進又不後退，祇有四週的船兒會把爾拚得粉碎！</p>
<p>呵！而今我望著那江心的一隻船兒還在！</p>

<p>— 翠英</p>
<p>許久時候不生病了，在我，是個希有的奇蹟。七八年來，據醫生說，患的是肺病一生這個病是怪舒適的，當時還在求學時代，就［當官］的不上學去，聽見同學們說大考時開了幾天夜車，我就希望這個病永遠生下去；果然，到現在七八年了，無論那一位有一付聽筒的醫生都證明我是肺病，這樣一直舒服到現在；不開夜車，不到社會上去碰釘子。不過以為我承繼了相當的遺產，那是猜錯了的，在舒服的病中不免動筆寫一點［病榻之畔］等雜文就可以證明。</p>
<p>開始知道患這個病自然在吐血之後，中國人的患這個病大都是這樣的，理由並不是中國人太不注意衛生，實在平白地化幾塊錢上醫生那裹去檢騐體格，天賦這個福氣的太少了。</p>
<p>一吐紅，真是了不得天大事情，事實上雖然［舒適］，心中不瞞天地有些兒恐怕就死去似的。一上醫生那裹診治，更是不得了，說是第三期肺病，他自已努力抽著雪茄，一切器械拚命用火酒消毒，好像我這個人已是［那個］的了。</p>
<p>歸家來，在病榻之上讀些肺病自　ＡＢＣ，就每天牛奶，雞蛋，魚肝油當了飯吃，同時有位朋友在醫藥校讀書，他義務每天來打些鈣類的藥針。無憂　慮，把年初一送到年三十，高興睡時，睡它一輩子，我要起床走走，沒有誰來攔阻，七八年來，沒有死的模標。可是也怪，我的自療可謂至矣盡矣；住療養院至多照照太陽燈，我每天亦日光浴半小時呢。今年被朋友（就是義務打針的）的慫恿，又化了幾元幾角上醫生的們，他用聽筒聽過之後，蘭花了指頭在我肋骨上細細推敲，哼，那聲音是［冬冬］響的，肺病自療ＡＢＣ上告訴我那是呌清音，是肺部良好的現像。然而那醫生還是搖頭的，這樣使我懷疑醫生搖頭於他營業上有什麼聯帶關係；他堅要我照Ｘ光，說是可怕的第三期哩，非住院治療不可。這句話是今年春初，過了冬天，我又多活了一年，還是讀我的自療ＡＢＣ罷。</p>
<p>這樣說來，這病還不夠舒適嗎，可不知道肺病共分幾期，一期可以生它七八年，如其有十期的話，也不能說不長壽了。此之霍亂吐瀉，一點鐘內死上幾條命，豈上嚇煞人哉！</p>

<p>（四）台底下可反了</p>
<p>黑大個一尋思，俺長了這麼大年紀，還沒有站在這些人面前露過臉說過說，今天居然把俺架鷹似的架起來啦，他媽的！好說歹說斡他幾句再說吧！這傢伙勁更足，挺直了腰板軍綫桿木似的站在臺口，嘴張了半天可是沒有聲音，他真有點急啦！背後立著的那小個子，一看情形不對，趕快湊過去小聲地說：</p>
<p>［昨天晚上不是有位女同志教過你嗎？就照她教你的說吧！］</p>
<p>黑大個一聽更急啦，昨天晚上只顧品滋味，就沒有聽見她說的是什麼？今天可要吹燈㧞蠟關門大吉了！</p>
<p>［白軍沒有紅軍好！你說］後面小個子在唱雙簧。</p>
<p>［對啦！白軍沒看紅軍好，還是俺國民革命軍好。］黑大個說了這麼一句很覺著得意，臺底下可反了，</p>
<p>［反革命－打倒他！</p>
<p>打倒這個反革命！］</p>
<p>黑大個一先以為臺底下替他呌好，後來仔細一看不對勁！那些瘦鬼都張大了嘴，彷彿要生吞活剝他似的！這黑大個又想向後轉開腿跑，唱雙簧的傢伙把他一把攔住了，同時那個子喊呌了半天－－</p>
<p>［同志：不要亂吵！他沒有說明白，再呌他說。］</p>
<p>［你說紅軍好，國民革命軍是殺人放火的！］</p>
<p>黑大個嚇昏了，砲不了還得學著說：</p>
<p>［紅軍好，國民革命軍打的好！］</p>
<p>［這一下子黑大個由臺口滾下去，鬧了個狗吃屎，要不呌［兵不打兵］的口號還發生效力，黑大個至少得剝皮抽筋。</p>
<p>過了幾天，黑大個的勃頸上，他系上了一條紅色布帶，這個布帶的紅色，黑大個並沒有加似研究，系帶子那天早上，他心裹這樣噝咕著－－不管他污血，入血，狗血染的都好。</p>

<h3 id="c228">探險片導演范逹克的成功史 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>好萊塢有名的探險片導演范逹克，（van　dyke）就是那曾經在上海公映的［愛斯基摩］片的導演。</p>
<p>范逹克的父親是個律師，可是當他生出了九日後就死去了。當時，他那位還只二十一歲的母親，為了生計問題，只得加入一江湖班子，到各處去獻藝。當他們行到沙特爾地方，范逹克就被他的祖父接去，養在他的家裹。在這裹范逹克才得修畢了中學的課程。</p>
<p>自從畢業了中學後，他就獨個兒跑到社會上求自立。他曾在車站裹做過打雜的，以及電燈器具店的推銷員，運貨店裹的馬夫等，後來他又加入了母親的江湖班子。</p>
<p>然而，不久他退出來了。其後他又從事於炭鑛，牧塲，斫樹等工作。</p>
<p>一九一五年當他二十七歲的時候，在綠衫磯他為名導演葛利斐斯所看中，這就是他的新生活的出發點。葛利斐斯導演愛他能夠有著十八小時不斷地工作的精方，當開始攝製傑構（intolerance）的時候，就把他提㧞為副導演了。自從那時起，他就決心一生為電影界服務。</p>
<p>一九二八年為了奧普雷（o　brien）之［南洋之白影］的外景起見，他和弗拉哈玳導演一同渡到塔西吉島。可是不幸因為弗拉哈玳導演突然患了病，一時不得不中止攝製外景的工作了。然而范逹克代了弗拉哈玳導演，約七個月後，始將一切都攝製完竣，歸回好萊塢。該片公映後博得了非常的佳評，范逹克便一躍而成為好萊塢的名導演了。</p>
<p>自從由處女作得到盛名後，他又為了雷門諾伐羅主演的一偶像戀愛一派遣到塔西吉島攝取外景。他僅費了六星期的工夫，把它攝竣，而該片亦得到了各方的稱頌。於是他就大大地發展他製作探險片的技能，接電問世的就是那有名的［愛斯基摩］。</p>
<p>大多數的電影導演們，於攝影塲中，在經理等監視之下，能夠攝製很好的影片，可是一經離開而到荒涼的島上，或到冰雪堆積的山中，他們的導演之資格，就不免要等於零了。可是范逹克卻是例外。他雖是到非洲的蠻荒去拍外景，也能夠毫無遣憾地發揮他導演的才能。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c229">評［歌后情痴］ <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 碩甫</p>
<p>One　Night　of　Love</p>
<p>一大光明映</p>
<p>爵士jazz的歌聲，在都市裹，流行得和瘋狂也似的，無綫電播音，唱片，甚至於走路的閑人，也總會得哼上兩句新的電影歌曲了。</p>
<p>從許久到如今，被這些［鄭聲亂雅］的俗調，真使人聽得厭煩了，居然在這［歌后情癡］裹，給我洗了一洗耳朶，開了一開胃口，無疑的，這是一本古典型classic的輕歌劇light　opcra成功的作品。</p>
<p>說到歌劇opera當然不是把［民間謠唱］和［山歌］一類的庸俗曲調，改成一種四不像的東西，可以相比的。這裹是［嘔心滴血］，［引商刻羽］，斟酌六律五音，幾經鍜鍊編排，才能問世。一個樂家的成名，全在他編導的歌劇出演的一夕，這是藝術上何等光明偉大的事！</p>
<p>早年初聆音樂，卽便醉心於一種［流行小唱］popular　song，嗣後漸漸的能聽歌劇了，等到相當認識了西洋歌劇而後，覺得小曲實在淺薄而卑劣，竟至於觸耳肉麻</p>
<p>［歌后情癡］的劇材是很合歌劇演出的方式。自然的，和諧的，勻稱的，美妙的，把藝術人生很不吃力而幽　的寫出。不但是導演役克多，斯凱青格victor　schertain　der的成功，當然也要歸功於劇材的豊富。</p>
<p>女主角葛蘭絲摩亞歌唱的品格是很高的，至於拿什麼［歌喉嘹喨］［穿雲裂石］［繞梁三匝］等等的套語來稱讚她，我以為是看輕了她，祇有好蘭塢一般人所推崇她所謂［光榮］的喉音glorious　voice才可以算是確切。</p>
<p>配演的如卡彌那地（意大利人）的歌師，亞爾伯尼（西班牙人）的琴師，摩那倍利的另一歌女娜麗，都陪襯出這一部戲的精彩，僅韜爾保的必利，卻未能盡施所長。</p>
<p>劇中［卡門］和［胡蝶夫人］兩歌劇，本是很不相同的異國情調的歌曲，在葛蘭絲女士歌來，很能和魯克麗霞波利lucre　zia　bcri嫓美，這也是好蘭塢新這歌星中為大衆所樂於推崇的原因。</p>
<p>本片在最近所演歌舞片中，可算是一部精美的作品，在看完了之後，在無綫電播音中，便聽得近來中國所謂創造的歌唱，再回想到最近，好蘭塢從業負，來中國時認為桃花江這一類的曲調可以代表最近中國民族性的話，簡直滿身起馉鉵兒。</p>
<p>掙扎著病苦來寫這一段介紹式的評，雖然設受罪，卻也有相當的暢適，說不定比較好的藝術作品，有送窮驅瘧的功用。</p>
<h3 id="c230">評［海底探險］ <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>］</p>
<p>“The　Sea　Killers”－金域</p>
<p>正如題目所標示的，這片子該是一張奇異的海底歷險記了。可是實際上一及海面的描寫那麼多；而且應作為這片子的高潮的所探求的進行，也並不怎樣的險。</p>
<p>這兒，我們作為一張關於海的紀錄片，來說些意見吧。</p>
<p>作為幕前的一張長字幕這樣說：一八六八年，有一隻載運金子的船，從舊金山啟椗後，在墨西哥海面為海盜襲沉了。後來不曾撈打起來。</p>
<p>畫面是從一隊冒險去探求遣金者的船的航行開始，接著是許多航行中所見到的捕魚，捉海獺，以及鯨泳，烏翔一類的記載，最後他們到逹沉船所在地的晶石巖，由一個人帶著［生命綫］沉到海底去，遇到鯊魚，弄斷了他的［生命綫］，他的伙伴們於失望，悲哀中返航止。</p>
<p>由於如前所說的並沒有多大危險的塲面，與緊張的空氣，自始至終給予觀衆的印象也就不深刻。有些地方明明是捕魚者用尖長的叉子向海裹拋去的，待獲得的魚被拉上船來的時候，而從魚嘴里拿出的卻是鉤子。這呌人有不真實之感。又如幾次捉到的魚之由海中拉起時，除了魚的掙扎，因著漁本身的大小與性子的不同外，多用同一的式子拉上船來，這把原來該是所謂［奇］的一點平常化了。</p>
<p>祇有海獺逃走，海草流捲，海底探險者割了一個蚌以後的羣魚爭逐信些畫面，給了我們極美的印象與野趣。把捉得的石首魚抬了起來：由一個長人來比比，還夠不上魚的度，以及拉開魚嘴來顯示嘴的長大，與牙齒的犀利等，是頗可取的。</p>
<p>說明書上說船中有人無意地殺了一隻航海人視為至友的海豚。因此，全船震駭這一段，在畫面上我們並沒見到。作為他們這次探海，演成悲劇之主角的藍鯊魚，所謂為海上殺人不貶眼的魔鬼，也僅是並沒顯出牠的兇暴地給我們看到而已。</p>

<p>— 火</p>
<p>李萍倩編導的［無家可歸］中，冷靜而深刻地描寫現社會中的人們，在怎樣地生活著，苦鬥著。劇中描寫一個勞苦的碼頭小工，雖然他每日所得報酬是那麼地微薄，一家三口的生活也不能維持，但是他總忘記不了喝老酒，賭牌九，結果他剩下的僅有的四毛錢也輸了，他想著他妻子兒女在餓著肚子等待著他，等待著他這四毛錢去買藥醫治他不幸被火燒傷了的兒子。他想著想著，憤怒的火擾亂了他痛苦的神經，於是失手打死了一個人，而被判決了二十年的徒刑，從牢獄出來後，他已經是一個白髪班班的老者了。（卻）</p>

<p>過了幾天，梅覺得有些奇怪，就去問紐倫道：［紐倫，你來了幾天，你總不太說話，好像䖇䖇不樂似的，到底有什麼事？紐倫，你告訴我，到底有沒有別的人。你老實告訴我。我覺得奇怪，已經好久了－從我們定婚好那天起的。］她的眼睛緊緊看著他，她的嘴唇微微有些發顫。好過了一回又說道：［紐倫，你告訴我，或者一個人很容易的做差了什麼事呢。］紐倫默然無語了半晌，梅於是又說道：［紐倫，要是你覺得事情做差了，要是你有別的心愛的人，我不願意你因為我的緣故，而和她分離……無論如何……］她是竭力想做一個勇敢的人，但是她卻支持不住了。突然問她開始哭泣起來，伸著兩隻手抱了他，吊在他身上如同一個受了驚嚇的孩子一樣。紐倫想起了他自己來到福綠利逹的用意，就不覺自己罵自己太殘翠忍了。他緊緊抱住了她，替她拭著淚，並且安慰她道：［哦，梅，我沒有什麼別的人，不過我願電同你立即結婚。長期的訂婚，有些人是可以的，但是我……］梅抬起頭來向著他柔聲道：［我總以為我是愛你的，但我總不知道愛的愛得多末深一直到今天才知道。哦，紐倫，我亦愛我的嗎？是不是？你沒有我，就活不了嗎？是不是？］紐倫生來是個柔腸的人，在這個時候，他亦覺得不得不說句謊話了。他於是騙她道：［不錯的。我沒有你，我就不能活了。］他一頭說，一頭吻著她。他那天當晚，就離開了福祿利逹，回到紐約去了。</p>
<p>紐倫回到紐約之後，他恐怕一見愛琳，就會把在福祿利逹，所得的印象忘掉了，所以他一個禮拜沒有去看愛琳。但是隔了一個禮拜，他再也支持不住了。他於是在一天的下午，跑到明谷老太太家裹去喝茶，希望可以在那裹碰到愛琳。他那天在花房裹，找到了愛琳，她正在剪玫瑰花。他不覺喊了一聲：［愛琳］！愛琳看見了立即將玫瑰花和剪刀放了下來，默然地站了一回，然後回過頭來，伸出手來對著紐倫呌著：［我的親愛的，我的寶貝！］紐倫將她抱住了，兩個人半晌說不出話來。後來她將他推開了，她伸出手來，將手指觸著一顆草的鮮嫩的花。那朶花被她的手指一觸，就立即合攏起來，很迅速地枯乾了。愛琳於是低聲道：［紐倫，你不看剛才那朶小花？生命觸著它，它反而死了。紐倫，我們亦被生命觸著了，我們亦會死的］。紐倫咕道：［愛琳，愛琳。不要說那種話！我們才開始活著！我在福祿利逹的時候，我一定得了神經病了。我現在去告訴梅去！她一定會了解的。我這幾天之內再到福錄利逹去見梅去。我們是不能離開的！以後就永遠不用害怕了］。愛琳聽了，將身體靠住了花房的門，口中自言自語道：［哦，上帝呀！我為什麼要回來呢］！紐倫又將她抱在懷裹了說道：［為的這個。為的這個］。他吻著她。忽然外面有人喊道：［紐倫，紐倫！你在那裹］？紐倫聽了兩隻手進垂下來。他和愛琳面面相覻著，因為那是梅蕙蘭的聲音，梅向花房飛奔而來，好像一個半天沒有母親的小孩子一樣。（未完）</p>

<p>Proper Planning for Safeguarding National Highway Traffic and Security</p>

<p>Beiping. Recently, the influx of a large number of pseudo-national subsidiary coins and copper coins into the war zone has greatly affected finances. Relevant parties have now decided that if anyone carries more than 5,000 copper coins after each card of the Great Wall, they will not be allowed to enter. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. The price of copper coins in various counties within the war zone has plummeted, with each yuan exchangeable for 700 coins. The livelihoods of ordinary people have been severely affected. Customs officials have found that the reason for the price drop is that pseudo-countries have a surplus, and Japanese and Korean ruffians are shielding traitors and importing them privately from various ports. Zhang Yongnian, the director of Tianjin Customs Great Wall each card office, has ordered all cards to ban them. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Soong Mei-ling and Donner Accompanied Him</p>
<p>Jinan. At 0:07 PM this afternoon, Kong Xiangxi, Soong Mei-ling, and Donner flew to Jinan and landed at Zhangzhuang Airport. Han Fuqu and his wife, along with party, government, and military officials, as well as Shen Honglie and Ge Guangting, arrived at the airport to greet them. They went to the provincial government to discuss the renovation of the Confucius Temple in Qufu. Both public and private assistance should be provided. Kong also agreed to serve as chairman of the board of directors of Qilu University, resolving the dispute. Han hosted a banquet at the Pearl Spring Hotel, with various important Kong officials accompanying him. Mrs. Han hosted Soong at the Dongda Building. They then took a group photo together at Pearl Spring. At 2:00 PM, they left the provincial government and went to the airport. At 2:30 PM, Kong, Soong, and Shen Honglie flew to Qingdao. Kong said that he would fly to Nanjing on the 15th. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan. Kong Xiangxi's twenty-eight guards arrived in Jinan from Nanjing today to await Kong's arrival. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao. Kong Xiangxi and Soong Mei-ling took off in a Ford plane and arrived in Qingdao at 4:00 PM. They both stayed at the Guest House. Shen hosted a banquet in the evening to welcome Kong and others. According to Kong's reporter, he decided to inspect various agencies on the morning of the 15th and return to Shanghai in the afternoon. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan. Kong Xiangxi told reporters that he had a very good impression of his visit to Pingjin. In Shanxi, he persuaded Yan Xishan to donate funds to repair the Confucius Temple. Mayor Shen also decided to repair the Confucius Temple in Qingdao. I am fully responsible for the National Water Conservancy Commission, so I look at the water conservancy projects that should be carried out everywhere. The Haihe River in Tianjin is important to international trade, and the project is important. If it is not treated, it will be silted up and flooded. This morning, I took a plane to inspect it and decided to discharge water to silt the land, and avoid silting up the estuary. Previously, each mu of land was three yuan, and after the silt, each mu was sixty yuan. There are four benefits to banning silver exports: 1. Balance the price of silver and prevent speculators from shipping silver for profit. 2. More domestic goods can be exported. 3. Improve the exchange rate and avoid foreign goods dumping. 4. For sixty years, the exchange rights have been controlled by HSBC, and now they can be recovered and presided over by the Bank of China. Since Han took charge of Shandong, defense has been effective, and the Yellow River has not caused a disaster. The breach in Hebei has been repaired. (14th)</p>
<p>Tianjin. At 8:00 AM this morning, Kong Xiangxi inspected the Qijia Dian Diversion Gate and Intake Gate, two new projects on the upper reaches of the Haihe River. He departed from the Astor Hotel by car. Xiang Dicong, director of the Haihe River Engineering Office, and engineer Yang Baoling accompanied him along the river for inspection. After about an hour, he arrived at the Tianjin East Bureau Airport at 9:30 AM and took a plane with Soong Mei-ling and the Donner couple to leave Tianjin and head south. Yu accompanied the directors of various provincial departments and bureaus, as well as bankers and fellow Shanxi villagers, and many others saw him off at the airport. Kong paid close attention to the Haihe River project, saying that he would speed up the planning and implementation of the unfinished projects after arriving in Nanjing. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Praying for a Swift Resolution to the Tragic Case of President Shi <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Liangcai, president of this newspaper, was tragically attacked by bandits on the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway the other day. Zhi Jiang student Mr. Deng and driver Jincai were also killed. Mr. Shi's wife and son also narrowly escaped death. The terrible news spread, shocking the nation. Relatives and friends were all weeping with grief. Even on the streets and alleys of Shanghai, it was a common topic of conversation. This is not only because Mr. Shi had a long-standing reputation, which made people feel deeply, but also because the case was so cruel and unmatched. Colleagues who had followed Mr. Shi for years were now forever separated from him, which caused great sorrow. Thinking of the deceased who had passed away and left behind endless regrets, and the heinous criminals who had escaped the law and were roaming free, we intend to appeal to the authorities to quickly arrest the criminals and solve the case, so that justice may be served and the spirits of Mr. Shi and the others may be comforted. Premier Wang and Secretary-General Chu's telegrams of condolence have been received, expressing that they have already strictly ordered the arrest of the criminals. The Zhejiang Provincial Government and Shanghai Mayor Wu and others have also paid great attention to this and have sent out detectives to seriously pursue the arrest. This is something that Mr. Shi's family and colleagues are very grateful for.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou highway is the main artery of national transportation, so it is convenient for travelers to come and go and for goods to be transported. Because the places it passes through are all the essence of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it has the reputation of being a model highway. There are many famous cities and large towns along the line. The scenic spots attract visitors from China and abroad every day. Now, unfortunately, such a shocking tragedy has occurred. Few people will not regard this model highway as a dangerous path. We try to close our eyes and imagine the scene at that time. We see many bandits holding sharp weapons and with fierce expressions in broad daylight on the main road. They commit the most cruel violence, calmly kill people, and allow themselves to escape. Judging by their audacity, they do not know that there are road guards, let alone reason or humanity. Therefore, arresting the criminals and bringing them to justice, and punishing them with extreme penalties, is to extend the national order and to seek the safety of travelers.</p>
<p>Buddhism advocates the theory of karma and reincarnation. The Book of Documents says that Heaven rewards good deeds. With Mr. Shi's kindness and enthusiasm for social welfare, he should have enjoyed a long life. If not, he should have died in his bed, not in this terrible accident. However, the facts show that this is not the case. What else can be said? Or is it as the common people say, the sins of a previous life? Then the matter involves the ethereal and cannot be investigated. However, Mr. Shi has suffered an unexpected death, he should be vindicated after his death. Otherwise, how can good people be encouraged?</p>
<p>What is worrying is that the criminals have escaped and must know how to hide themselves. Perhaps they have fled far away. We sincerely hope that the central and local authorities will continue to work hard to arrest the criminals. Do not slack off because the time is long, and do not be lax because the area is large. If the main culprit can be brought to justice and admit his guilt, not only will people be greatly relieved, but also Mr. Shi and others will smile in the underworld if their souls are conscious.</p>

<p>At the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee Session</p>
<p>Geneva. The Opium Advisory Committee held an informal meeting today. The Chinese representative, Hu Shize, attended and reported on the situation of drug prohibition in China, with a detailed account. He paid particular attention to the alarming situation of smuggling in North China and cited the case of the secret morphine manufacturing plant busted in Tianjin on July 21 this year as an example. Representative Hu said that the Tianjin area is a major base for drug trafficking, in a certain hotel in the Japanese concession, condoning the so-called private smuggling from North China and all kinds of illegal activities. Hu then, according to a Central News Agency dispatch, said that in North China, large quantities of drugs have repeatedly been smuggled into customs under the protection of the Japanese through the Great Wall. All of this shows that Japan is now poisoning North China on a large scale and cited the essay by Dr. Eddie published in the Beijing-Tianjin Times on September 25 as evidence. The committee members were very satisfied with Representative Hu's detailed report. (13th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Berlin. Some circles here do not believe that Germany will buy soybeans again in the London market, because there are still large quantities of soybeans in Hamburg warehouses, which are affected by Germany's exchange rate status and cannot be presented. There is no need to buy more. As for the rumor in London that Germany will buy soybeans again, it was probably caused by the recent establishment of a new company in Germany. However, the company has not yet started operating. It is said that the company's business will be to find suitable partners to enter into barter contracts, that is, to exchange German goods for soybeans. The new company will soon be looking for markets in various countries, especially [Manchukuo]. It is expected that Germany's existing soybeans will not be cleared before the end of January 1935, and Germany will not continue to buy soybeans before they are cleared. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>London. The pseudo-Manchukuo government issued a kerosene monopoly law yesterday. Regarding this matter, the British government once protested to Japan. It is still not satisfied with the Japanese response and is now exchanging views with the Dutch and American governments. It is reported that the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands will make new protests to Japan. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Drafting a Treaty on the Management of Arms</p>
<p>London. The American and British naval representatives will meet at the Foreign Office at a quarter past two this afternoon. It is expected that naval talks will be activated again. The convener of today's meeting is the British representative and the purpose of the talks has not been notified to the United States, but the entire US delegation has been requested to attend. This meeting is important, from which it can be imagined that the British representative will submit the proposals submitted to the Japanese representative last week to the United States for discussion. Japan has not yet had a definite response to this proposal. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington. The United States, in view of the increasing phenomenon of international naval treaty destruction, has largely determined its naval plans for the near future. The United States has practically abandoned hope of establishing an arms reduction agreement in the near term. Secretary of State Hull said that the United States is now trying to formulate an international treaty to control the manufacture and sale of arms, as this type of agreement may be easier to achieve than a naval agreement. Hull also said that the United States will not seek the opinion of Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira on this issue. Under these circumstances, it is considered very important here that the United States should have a definite naval plan, and its recent developments are as follows: 1. Congressman Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, proposed building two large airships to replace the Akron and Los Angeles. 2. The Budget Office approved the construction of 24 warships in 1935 in accordance with the Vinson naval plan. 3. Senior naval authorities told the Associated Press that they did not trust pocket battleships because they could not resist the attack of large battleships. (13th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Problem of Managing Armaments: US Promotes Original Plan <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the problem of managing armaments in Washington, the American government has drafted an international agreement and will submit it for discussion at the meeting of the presidium of the disarmament conference and the armament trade management committee under the conference on November 20. This draft is based on the International Convention on Armament Trade concluded in Geneva on June 17, 1925. According to this convention, all armament import and export merchants must obtain permission from their respective governments before each transaction can be shipped. The draft proposed by the United States now extends this, requiring not only the sale, but also the manufacturing of armaments to be licensed. It is noted that the United States is also a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Convention, but because other countries, such as England, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Italy, have made reservations, the United States has not been able to ratify it.

<h3 id="e17">MacDonald's Statement <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a campaign to support the current government was held in Southend-on-Sea, London. Prime Minister MacDonald attended the meeting and delivered a speech, stating that the government has always respected peace. He said, "Peace is an ideal, and it can only be realized if all countries in the world agree to it." Regarding the international convention to crack down on the sale of armaments, the Prime Minister said that the British government has the desire to establish an international agreement, but it is difficult for any country to achieve it through state monopoly. The British government will adopt a licensing system for the sale of armaments and will try to promote it in Geneva so that it becomes a universal method. MacDonald concluded by saying that, "As far as the current situation is concerned, armaments can only be allowed to exist, but we hope to reduce them. Reducing armaments is also a day and night effort, and we will never admit failure." (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>In a speech in Southampton, London, British Prime Minister MacDonald stated that on November 11, standing in front of the monument commemorating the fallen soldiers, he swore that Britain must find a way to make war a thing of the past. The British government is actively pursuing peace, and he is thinking about disarmament methods day and night. He is determined not to admit failure. The British government does not allow private arms factories to manufacture certain types of armaments for certain purposes, resulting in thousands of more unemployed people. However, during the Manchurian Incident, although Britain advocated not supplying arms to China and Japan, other countries did not agree to do so. Now, the way to deal with this matter is to expand the licensing system and make it an international method. The British government intends to hold this event in Geneva in the shortest possible time.

<p>The naval talks between Britain, the United States, and Japan have been silent for a week. It seems that activities will resume tomorrow or Thursday. When the British and Japanese representatives meet next time, the Japanese representatives will submit Japan's response to the British compromise plan. At the same time, the British government will notify the autonomous governments of the latest developments at any time. The representatives of the autonomous regions met in the Autonomous Regions Office today. British cabinet ministers such as Foreign Secretary Simon attended the meeting. The Minister of Autonomous Regions Affairs, Thomas, reported the latest situation of the naval talks to the representatives. The meeting lasted for two hours. (Reuters News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>The British government notified the autonomous territories of the situation of the naval talks between Britain, Japan, and the United States. Today, senior commissioners of the autonomous territories stationed in the United States and representatives of India held a meeting in the Overseas Autonomous Territories Department. British government officials presented a detailed report on the latest developments in the talks. It is likely that the representatives have expressed their views on naval issues within the scope of the empire. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Since the British government insisted on changing its previous views on the Washington Treaty and proposed a compromise trial plan to the Japanese delegation, the American delegation has been quite dissatisfied. Therefore, they may hold consultations on the afternoon of the 14th and raise considerable questions to the representatives of the British government. In short, recently, the saying that Britain and Japan are getting closer has been prevailing, and there are arguments in the United Kingdom that respect the friendly relations between Britain and the United States. Therefore, the representatives of the autonomous governments and others advocate that British-American coordination is even better material for the American delegation. Moreover, the French and Italian governments are also paying attention to the progress of the preparatory consultations. If the Japanese government is granted equal rights in armaments, then the French and Italian governments will immediately advocate equal rights as well. Therefore, this matter is very difficult. At this point in the naval preparatory consultations, it can be predicted that the outcome will be a complete failure. However, in order to avoid the responsibility for breaking down the negotiations, until the last moment, no proposals will be made. Only proposals within all possible scope will be deliberated, maintaining this attitude and calmly watching, and letting it end naturally. (Japan United News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Regarding the purpose of the third British-American consultation on the 14th, the British government applicant did not mention any situation. The American delegation was surprised by the sudden application. Since the British government proposed the trial plan, the relationship between Britain and the United States has not been very good. It is possible that the British government may be able to offer explanations and any proposals based on the results of the autonomous territories representatives meeting on the 13th. The British government is wary of the recent complex relations with various countries, fearing misunderstandings, and seems to be extremely vigilant. Therefore, regarding the British-American consultation, Ambassador Matsudaira has also been notified. (Japan United News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>New Premier Explains Determination to Safeguard the Republican System</p>
<p>Appeals to All Factions to Unite to Overcome Current Difficulties</p>
<p>The French Chamber of Deputies today passed a vote of confidence in the Flandin government with 422 votes against 118. Initially, Mr. Flandin submitted the new government's major policies to the public, which was warmly welcomed, which is rare for any government in the current parliament. The Radical Party unanimously supported the new government, and Mr. Flandin also received some support from the Socialist Party, as there are 133 socialists among the 600 members of the Chamber of Deputies. (Reuters News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Today, the new Prime Minister of the French Cabinet, Mr. Flandin, attended the Chamber of Deputies and delivered a declaration, explaining the major policies of the new cabinet. After that, he began to discuss the general policy questioning case. Among the deputies who raised questions, the most important one was Mr. Teare of the New Socialist Party. Mr. Teare attacked national economism, first saying that if the economic situation is to be restored, the currency must be stabilized first. Therefore, he hoped that the protocol recently established in Beijing by the countries of the gold standard group could be expanded. (According to the Beijing Protocol, stabilizing the currency will promote trade.) Mr. Teare advocated economic control and opposed economic freedom, saying that following the path of economic freedom will not know where to end. As for the economic control policy, it is the only way to remedy the economic panic. The economic control policy should be decided by the National Economic Conference, implemented by the government, and supervised by the parliament. Mr. Teare then demanded constitutional reform, revising some of the outdated articles of the Constitution, and demanding the requisition of private interests to seek public interests. At this point, Prime Minister Flandin stood up and replied, saying, [“The new cabinet has figures from all factions, and its purpose is to help the country overcome difficulties, regardless of whether the theories held by each person are the same. Now the country has economic panic, political difficulties, and spiritual confusion. All of these are not theoretical issues. I firmly believe that if we want to help the country overcome difficulties, we must release the shackles of the people and gradually return their freedom. But what I said does not mean abolishing all tariff protection systems. I mean to sort out all the problems, and consider the times, and proceed gradually.”] When Mr. Flandin concluded, his first sentence was, [“Our only purpose is to maintain peace. Our pursuit of domestic political and social peace is precisely to seek international peace.”] The latter part of the conclusion was also extremely moving. He said, [“Foreigners constantly slander France, saying that it will fall into chaos and become an anarchic state. I sincerely hope that you can abandon partisan views and unite with each other, set an example, so that France, in the eyes of the world, can become a unified, strong, and ambitious country, that is, France will never give up the hope of democracy, and will always be loyal to the republican system inherited from its ancestors. The republican system is in line with the nature of the French people, and we will preserve it, as a model for other countries that have abandoned the republican system. France will be established in the world and become a guarantee of peace. We should know that 1.5 million people died for peace, and their remains are still buried in France.”] When Mr. Flandin finished his speech, most of the deputies applauded and cheered, but the far-leftists did not express anything. The government proposed a vote of confidence, and then Roland Enak of the left-wing Radical Party, Delbos of the Radical Socialist Party, and Barr of the left-wing Republican Party proposed a vote of confidence in the government, which stated [“After the Chamber of Deputies listened to the government's declaration, it expressed its trust in the government, so that it can continue to implement the party truce, and engage in economic recovery and preparations for constitutional reform in the republican order and internal and external peace.”] The opposition deputies proposed a motion to suspend the meeting, which was rejected by two-thirds of the deputies. Leroux of the Central Republican Party declared his trust in the government. Then Léon Blum, the leader of the Orthodox Socialist Party, attacked the political and constitutional truce in the name of the constitution, saying [“We are a party that strives.”] And said that the party would vote against the government because it did not approve of the party truce and because of economic policy reasons. Free economism, as we see it, is tantamount to self-destruction. Léon Blum said [“The natural selection of barbarism is based on free competition.”] Léon Blum also disagreed with the deflation policy. Leroux-Tal of the New Socialist Party took over and said, [“This party believes that the new cabinet is not a truce cabinet, but only a temporary rest for the parties. Therefore, this party will give up the right to vote.”] As for the Communist Party, it naturally expressed that it would vote against it. Finally, Delbos, a deputy of the Radical Socialist Party, expressed his trust in the government in the name of the party, because the party leader Herriot is still listed in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Therefore, the Radical Socialist Party has more confidence in the new cabinet. After the representatives of the parties expressed their attitudes, the vote was held. As a result, the government’s confidence motion proposed by Roland Enak, Delbos, and Barr was passed with a majority of 423 votes against 118, and the government won. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e22">Political Situation After Overthrow of Belgian Cabinet Will Not Last Long <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Current Foreign Minister Will Start Forming New Cabinet</p>
<p>Chamber of Deputies Rejects Currency Devaluation Bill</p>
<p>Brussels The government of Belgian Prime Minister Count de Broqueville resigned en masse today. It is expected that the political situation will not last long. The government's fall is mostly due to economic difficulties, because several cabinet members do not agree to reduce government spending. According to Mr. Broqueville, before resigning, he told the Chamber of Deputies that the budget could be balanced. The three major parties, Catholic, Liberal, and Socialist, unanimously decided to maintain the gold standard and the current price of the franc. The way to resolve the current political situation is probably that the Liberal Party is the most powerful in Congress and opposes accommodating the Socialist Party. (Reuters News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Brussels The Broqueville cabinet has resigned. It is generally believed that Broqueville will not reorganize the new cabinet, and current Foreign Minister Jaspar will succeed as Prime Minister. However, no matter who the replacement is, the new government will definitely oppose the ban on currency devaluation and will promote a comprehensive economic recovery plan.

<p>The London Morning Post's correspondent in Germany published an essay commenting on Germany's reorganization of its armaments, with particular emphasis on the reorganization of the German National Defense Force. He said, [“According to reliable sources, the first stage of Germany's reorganization of armaments has now been reliably reached. Although Germany's armaments are now actively expanding, the country's military leaders believe that they will not be able to support the war until 1938 at the earliest. For this reason, the pressure that the general staff can exert on Germany's foreign policy is still moderate. When Germany withdrew from the League of Nations on the 14th of the last decade, the National Defense Force had 21 infantry divisions, 4 cavalry divisions, and 18,000 officers, which exceeded the 4,000 people stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles by 14,000 people. The total number of officers, including staff, must not exceed 4,000. As for the term of service of the National Defense Force, it is currently between two and twelve years. Compulsory military service can be established soon. Once established, the term of service will be reduced to 18 months.”] (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>Vienna Someone asked Prime Minister Schuschnigg, [“Will Austria announce the monarchy before Christmas this year?”] Mr. Schuschnigg replied, [“I believe you will not have enough patience to wait for the arrival of the restoration date.”] The saying that the Habsburg royal family will be restored has disappeared because of Mr. Schuschnigg's words. Mr. Schuschnigg continued to mention the relations between Germany and Austria, and once again stated that the fault for the discord between the two countries does not lie with Austria. The key to easing relations between the two countries is not in Austria. Mr. Schuschnigg also said, [“What Austria wants is only peace and tranquility. The policy adopted is not against any country, and its only purpose is to maintain and develop economic relations with all neighboring countries.”] Finally, Mr. Schuschnigg claimed that he only intends to go to Rome for a trip, and may go to other countries when necessary, but its nature is purely economic.

As a result of Foreign Minister Hirota's meeting with Ambassador Yurenev at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, both sides expressed their approach. The following points were agreed: 1. Upon acceptance, the Soviet Union will recognize the additional instructions to the Soviet-Manchurian authorities in Harbin to prepare the loan table up to the date of signing. 2. The Jiangzhou side also agreed to the period of payment of goods to be three years. 3. As for cash payment, if the Japanese yen fluctuates against the Swiss currency by 8% or more in the future, the exchange rate should be determined and paid according to this market price. The Soviet Union still insists on its claims on the remaining payment guarantee, payment method, and acceptance issue conditions, and opinions have not yet been agreed.

<p>Removal of Restrictions on Gold Exports Leaves a Good Impression</p>
<p>Generally Considered a Prelude to the Stability of the Pound</p>
<p>Washington Observers today stated that from the point of view of removing restrictions on cash exports, the Ministry of Finance obviously will continue its conservative monetary policy. After research, Washington experts declared that the significance of this move lies in the government's decision to oppose the devaluation of the US dollar within a considerable period of time. Some government leaders hope that the US's action will be a prelude to the abolition of cash exports around the world. The industry claims that most countries are unable to pay and the obstacles to cash exports actually reduce world trade, so it is hoped that the US's action will be beneficial to international trade. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>New York The US Treasury Department's cancellation of various restrictions on foreign exchange yesterday has had a good impression across the country. Many people believe that it is an expression of confidence in the future of the currency. Many quarters believe that this is a solid guarantee that the US dollar has now stabilized, and is one of the concrete developments arising from the recent compromise between the government and bankers. The officialdom has expressed its confidence in the US dollar, and there is a high possibility of revival in the capital market, and a large number of American funds are expected to flow back. It is also said that the Treasury Department's move at least indicates that the UK and the US have reached an understanding on the final stability of the exchange rate between the pound and the US dollar, and the stability of the exchange rate is now closer to reality than before. (Reuters News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>New York According to the general opinion of financial leaders on Wall Street, although the Ministry of Finance has removed restrictions on cash exports, the flow of US funds to foreign countries will decrease. Most countries in Europe are now experiencing difficulties, and Americans do not need to worry about the outflow of funds. Wall Street now believes that the Ministry of Finance's actions are very clever. At this time when the European political situation is deteriorating, the government took the opportunity to express a major policy and consolidate its own position. Most experts believe that the removal of restrictions on cash exports will ultimately be beneficial to the US dollar, but officials claim that the removal of restrictions has nothing to do with the US dollar. Some parties on Wall Street said that the removal of restrictions on cash exports is a prelude to the conclusion of a currency stability agreement between the UK and the US.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also gained a very positive impression of the various regions during this trip. Due to the importance of suppressing bandits, he returned south from Taiyuan by Eurasia Airlines' large aircraft at 12:00 noon on the 11th. He arrived in Hankou at 3:00 PM. Originally, he planned to continue to Jiangxi on the same aircraft, but due to unfavorable weather conditions, he traveled eastward from Hankou on the Yong Sui warship at 8:00 PM on the 11th. He arrived in Xunyang at 9:15 AM on the 12th. Chinese and foreign warships fired salutes, and the whole city hung flags in enthusiastic welcome. Chen Lei, the 9th Garrison Commander, Li Zhongxiang, the Director of the Municipal Council, and Bao Gongren, the County Magistrate, all stood respectfully at the dock to greet him. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek disembarked and greeted the welcoming crowd, he proceeded directly to the airfield and boarded the Eurasia Airlines' large aircraft that had been flown in from Hankou and was waiting for him. He flew to the province around 10:00 AM. After receiving a phone call from Jiujiang, the Nanchang Aviation Station immediately reported to the headquarters and the provincial government. After the Sun Yat-sen birthday memorial week was dismissed, military and political leaders rushed to the airfield outside the city to greet him. Those present included Ding Chaowu, Tai Shih-hui, Gu Zhutong, He Guoguang, Chen Qingyun, Wang Yitang, and over 200 other senior officials from the provincial capital. At 11:30 AM, the large aircraft arrived from the north with a rumbling sound, circling the city once before landing at the airfield amidst uplifting military music. All welcoming personnel went to the aircraft to salute and welcome him. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, wearing a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, draped with a black cloak, slowly disembarked and repeatedly nodded to those welcoming him, expressing his gratitude. He shook hands with Wang Yitang, exchanging greetings. He then boarded a headquarters car and went directly to his private residence in Beitan. Accompanying Chairman Chiang Kai-shek were Secretary Li Rizhang and several bodyguards. Madame Chiang had already gone to Beiping. Yang Yongtai and his staff were traveling south via the Beiping-Hankou Railway and are expected to arrive tomorrow. Li Jingcong, the manager of Eurasia Airlines, accompanied Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the same aircraft, taking care of everything along the way.</p>
<p>After arriving at his private residence, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with Tai Shih-hui, Gu Zhutong, He Guoguang, and others, listening to reports on the bandit suppression military affairs in the province, the aftermath in the recovered areas, and all matters pertaining to the headquarters. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave instructions on everything. He also had meticulous plans for intercepting Zhu De and Mao Zedong, and annihilating the bandit leaders Xu Xiangqian, He Long, and Xiao Ke.

<h3 id="e103">Expansion of the Beiping City Area <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Beiping to Become a Purely Cultural City</p>
<p>Area Boundaries to Be Redefined</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Due to Beiping's history as a capital for hundreds of years, its cultural relics, historical heritage, and cultural artifacts hold the most superior position in the country. Therefore, after the September 18th Incident, intellectuals and social figures suggested turning Beiping into a cultural city, permanently without troops stationed or military institutions established. It is reported that a certain magnate recently arrived in Beiping, and Mayor Yuan Liang presented a proposal to expand the Beiping area, introduce rivers, and incorporate scenic spots such as the Big and Small Tangshan Mountains and the Eight Great Sites of Fragrant Hills in western Beijing, to transform Beiping into a purely beautified city. The magnate also believes that, in terms of political and diplomatic relations, it is necessary to simultaneously upgrade Beiping and Tianjin into special municipalities. Thus, the expansion of the Beiping area is being resolutely carried out. Recently, it was heard that the municipal authorities have drafted various designs for the new metropolitan area, assigning famous scholars and Beijing historical and geographical experts to various positions. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi also came to Beiping with financial specialists to make provisions for the future division of financial areas and the establishment of tax collection agencies. Military and government offices may also have to be slightly relocated for ease of control. The general scope of the city expansion is as follows: 1. Area: The southern suburbs of Daxing and Wanping counties (the offices of these two counties were originally located within the city of Beijing, one administering the eastern city and the other administering the western city; after the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang, one was moved to Lugou Bridge), including Nanyuan, Huangcun, Fengtai, Caiyu Town, Lixian Town, Qingyundian, Sunhe Town (all belonging to Daxing), Changxindian, Langouqiao, Mentougou, Qinghe Town, as well as the Big and Small Tangshan Mountains in northern Beiping and the Fragrant Hills, Longevity Mountain, and Eight Great Sites in western Beiping, are all incorporated into the city. The endpoint of the entire city extends east to Tongzhou, north to Changping, west to Liangxiang, and south to Anci. The Ming Tombs are also included within the city's boundaries. 2. Boundaries: The eastern suburbs from Dongba and Bailu Temple to the western suburbs of Sanjiadian, the southern boundary is Dahuangmen, and the northern boundary is Yangfang, spanning 76 li from east to west and 60 li from north to south, covering an area of approximately 1,750 square li. The inner city is 10 li wide and long, covering an area of 100 square li. The Imperial City is 18 li in circumference, occupying about one-fifth of the inner city. The Forbidden City is 6 li in circumference, occupying one-quarter of the Imperial City. The Three Seas occupy two-ninths of the Imperial City. The outer city is 28 li in circumference, covering an area of 96 li. 3. Historical Names and Evolution: Beiping was originally named Beijing. In historical records, it is the old Jizhou area of Yu's Nine Provinces. During the Zhou Dynasty, the descendants of Yao were enfeoffed in Ji, and the descendants of Duke Zhao were enfeoffed in Yan. During the Later Wei and Qi Zhou dynasties, it was called Yan Commandery. During the Tang Dynasty, it was called Youzhou. During the Song Dynasty, it was called Yanshan Prefecture. During the Liao Dynasty, it was elevated to the status of Nanjing. During the Yuan Dynasty, it was rebuilt as Dadu. During the Ming Dynasty, it was renamed Beiping Prefecture and designated as the fiefdom of the Prince of Yan. In the first year of the Yongle reign, the Prince of Yan swept away the Yuan troops to the north and moved the Ming capital here, thus naming it Beijing and establishing Shuntian Prefecture, which then divided Daxing and Wanping counties. The Qing Dynasty followed the Ming Dynasty without major reforms. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai changed Shuntian Prefecture to Jingzhao. After the successful Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang, the government moved south, renaming it Beiping and designating it as a special municipality. Shortly thereafter, it was changed to an ordinary municipality. Now, with the expansion of the area, its system is being changed back to a special municipality. (December 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Liu Xiang Travels East to Meet Chiang Kai-shek <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Summons Generals of Five Routes at Wanxian for Instructions</p>
<p>May Visit Authorities in Nanjing After Meeting Chiang</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan Province, has been planning to travel east to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek since resuming his post after a telegram announcement. He intends to report on the situation of remnant bandits in the province, the progress of the armies on all routes in suppression operations, and to seek instructions. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek happened to be on a northern inspection tour, preventing the meeting. However, through exchanged telegrams, they decided to meet in Hankou. Chiang returned south from Shanxi the day before yesterday, only staying in Hankou for a few hours before proceeding to Jiangxi. Liu telegraphed Chiang again for instructions and received Chiang's permission to meet in Nanchang instead. After receiving the telegram, Liu put everything aside and delegated the affairs of the general headquarters and military headquarters to Chief of Staffs Guo and Li respectively. He himself, along with Secretary-General Li Biguo, Chief of the General Staff Zhang Lingjiu, and members of various groups of the headquarters, along with over a hundred guards, departed from Chongqing aboard the Bayu warship at 8:00 AM on the 13th. They arrived in Wanxian that evening. Tang Shizun, Fan Shaozeng, and other front-line generals of the Fifth Route Army, having been summoned by Liu's telegram in advance, rushed from Suixuan to Wanxian to greet him. Liu convened a meeting to discuss in detail the bandit suppression arrangements and command matters during his absence from Sichuan. Liu also gave instructions. Liu stayed in Wanxian for one night and then continued eastward on the original warship. He is expected to arrive in Hankou via Yichang and Shashi on the 15th. He Chenjun received a telegram from Liu on the 13th stating, "Xiang is traveling east by steamer on the first day of the month to meet with the Chairman and seek instructions. Please be informed of the circumstances." He immediately telegraphed Shashi to order Xu Yuanquan to represent him in welcoming Liu and dispatched a plane and a warship to Yichang for standby use. In addition to welcoming Liu in Shashi, Xu also ordered Huang Xin, the brigade commander stationed in Yichang, to warmly welcome Liu upon his arrival in Yichang. Xu will also accompany Liu to Hankou. It is heard that Liu will stay in Hankou for one day to visit Zhang Xueliang, He Chenjun, and Zhang Qun before proceeding to Jiangxi to meet Chiang. If time permits, he will then go to Nanjing to visit the central authorities before returning to Sichuan to supervise the suppression efforts. Liu's representatives in Nanjing and Shanghai, Fu Zhenwu and Deng Wujie, having heard the news of Liu's eastward journey, arrived in Hankou earlier to greet him. Wang Lingji, the former commander of the Fifth Route Army who is residing in Shanghai, will also take the opportunity to come here. (December 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Guangzhou Ferry Bombing Case <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Bomb Explodes, Three People Injured</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Suichang ferry, which travels between Zhaoqing and Guangzhou, has been operating on the Xijiang route for a long time. However, on the 6th of this month, when the ship arrived at the Guangzhou wharf, an explosion suddenly occurred, injuring three people. It is said that the incident happened because extortion attempts failed, and the criminals hid a bomb on the ship as a threat. When the ship docked at the new wharf on Xidi at about 12:00 AM on the 6th, hundreds of passengers disembarked in good order. When the passengers were almost gone, the owner ordered the crew to clean the cabin. A sailor named Mai Lian found a white iron can containing cigarettes at the bow of the ship. Initially, he thought it was left behind by a passenger, so he took the can to examine it under the light. Just as he was feeling around, there was a flash of light, followed by a loud explosion. The whole ship shook. The crew members rushed over and saw Mai lying in a pool of blood. The five fingers of his left hand and part of his palm had been blown off, a bloody mess, and he was unconscious. A cook named Wu Chihming and a fishmonger named Li Chi were also injured and lying on the ground. Soon after, detectives arrived and searched for the perpetrators. A certain Mr. A, looking flustered, was climbing ashore from the ferry. The police questioned him, and he claimed to be a merchant transporting goods. When questioned by the crew, they all said they were unfamiliar with him. The police considered him suspicious and detained him at the police station for questioning. The three injured were sent to the municipal hospital for treatment. Mai Lian, who was severely injured, had his left arm amputated by the doctor. He is said to be from Nanhai County, 36 years old. Wu Chihming, due to his lighter injuries, was discharged from the hospital the next day after receiving treatment. Fishmonger Li Chi and Mai Lian are still hospitalized. Only a small hole was pierced in the deck of the Suichang ferry's bow, and the hull was not significantly damaged. After the owner reported the case to the authorities as usual, requesting a strict investigation of the perpetrators, the ferry returned to Zhaoqing the next day (7th) as usual, carrying cargo.

<h3 id="e106">Aftermath of the Disaster at Changting <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Local Security is Gradually Improving</p>
<p>Daily Necessities are Especially Lacking</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the National Army recovered Changting, Changting refugees returned to their hometowns in droves. The Tinglong Association in Chaozhou Prefecture has set up a refugee registration office. All returnees must register there, be issued a passport, and carry it with them to travel by boat and car free of charge along the way. Changting people living in Chaozhou and Shantou have first sent several people via Shanghang back to Changting to check the actual situation in their hometown after the chaos. Today, a report from Changting merchants stated that when the remnant bandits saw the arrival of the Eastern Route Army, they made a slight resistance in Hang, and then fled to the Jie Ling area of Gucheng. Gucheng was recovered by Li Mo'an on the fourth day. The bandits scattered and fled in several directions. The security in western Fujian is gradually improving. Chen Zhuoru, the administrative commissioner of the Eighth District, has moved his office to Changting City. The headquarters of the Eastern Route Army has moved to Shang Longyan. The highway from Longyan to Liancheng is now open. After the Red bandits retreated, only elderly, weak, disabled men and women remained in the villages and townships. The fields were barren and there was no purchasing power. The silver dollars and copper coins have been completely absorbed by the bandits using counterfeit Farmers and Workers Bank notes. The shops in the market towns have dilapidated walls and roofs, and no doors or windows. In the villages and homes, there are no chickens or dogs, and no complete stoves, water tanks, plates, or bowls. There is a lack of materials, and there is nowhere to buy them. Salt, oil, iron nails, matches, medicines, and all daily necessities must be transported by land from Longyan, making them extremely expensive. It is very difficult for refugees returning to their hometowns to maintain a livelihood. Moreover, the north wind is beginning to blow, piercing the skin and bones like knives. The cotton clothes and bedding of Changting families have long been looted by the bandits. People are using straw or fire for warmth. They desperately hope that the authorities and philanthropists from other places will provide urgent relief. (November 8th)</p>
<p>International Commercial Telegram</p>
<p>November 14th, Special Commercial News from Reuters</p>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London Bullion: Today, the price of silver in London is down one-eighth. The spot price is 24.75 pence, and the futures price is 24.875 pence. China sold in the morning, and speculators bought and operated. The closing was calm.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: The foreign exchange market in London was quiet today. The British pound has a weak trend against the US dollar. The opening price of the British-American exchange rate was $4.9975, half a cent lower than yesterday's closing price of the American-British exchange rate. It fell another 0.0625 at eleven o'clock, but rose 0.125 at one o'clock in the afternoon to $4.998125. The price remained unchanged at two o'clock.</p>
<p>British-French: The fluctuation of the franc is also very slight. The opening price of the British-French exchange rate was 75.87 francs, 9 pounds lower. It rose 3 pounds at eleven o'clock, and fell 6 pounds at noon, but recovered 6 pounds at one o'clock in the afternoon. The price at two o'clock remained unchanged at 75.90 francs.</p>
<p>American-British: The foreign exchange market in New York was slightly stronger today. The opening price of the American-British exchange rate was $5.00, down 0.25. The American-French exchange rate was 6.56625. The market was quiet in the morning.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: This morning, the New York cotton market opened sluggish, down three pounds from yesterday's closing price. Traders continued to buy as usual. In addition, there were straddle transactions with sellers from the South and buyers from Liverpool. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration advocates increasing the area of ​​underground cotton fields, fearing that if the United States continues to reduce production, Brazil will export cotton to compete with the United States, just as the United States reduces wheat production, while Argentina and Canada export wheat to compete with the United States. However, the bureau does not agree to lower prices and hopes that foreign merchants can use the credit loans arising from silver imports to purchase American cotton.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market also saw lower prices today. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the price for the January futures was 6.58, down four pounds from yesterday's closing.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market fell 0.125 this morning. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the opening price for the February futures was 4 shillings 10.25 pence.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market saw a slight drop in futures prices due to favorable weather in the Southwest. Grain prices also fell slightly due to abundant supply. However, the weather in the northern grain belt is currently colder, so the supply may not actually be that plentiful.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: London rubber was stable this morning. At noon, the transaction price for January and March futures was 6.5 pence, the same as yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: Rubber opened down ten pounds, and then fell another ten pounds. With the price falling, the market turned active and traders bought in.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: Before the opening of the New York stock market, the factors favorable to the market were (1) the Chicago steel mills had increased by one point, reaching 31% of production capacity; (2) the number of railway cars loaded was estimated to be down 12,000 from the previous week, but the increase was still greater than last year; (3) the abolition of foreign exchange restrictions allowed speculators to sharply reduce demand for so-called inflated securities and certain items, but most believe that this measure will ultimately benefit many parties. The factor unfavorable to the market was that during the past week, the market showed a strong trend and there was favorable news for trade, but although the market price had recovered, it ultimately failed to continue and progress, which was disappointing. Today, the stock market opened still active, with slight discrepancies in market price fluctuations. Most stock prices fell slightly. Merchants are unwilling to move forward with the rising trend, so stock market trade is unlikely to have significant fluctuations. The various market prices of New York securities are as follows:</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Rice Industry Association Investigates White Racketeering</p>
<p>The local Rice Industry Association has always taken a unified approach to the business operations of its affiliated rice shops, and has established industry rules to ensure compliance with integrity. This county is a rice-producing region, and fluctuations in rice prices are closely related to people's food. Occasional competition is enough to cause the danger of monopoly or disruption of the market. The aforementioned industry rules have been submitted to the county for record. Recently, with Xin Yi taking office, according to regulations, each firm is not allowed to send partners to the countryside to purchase rice, only farmers are allowed to transport it to Songjiang for sale. However, according to recent reports from various parties, some people have violated the industry rules and gone to the countryside to purchase rice at high prices. The Rice Industry Association issued a notice to all its members, reiterating compliance with the industry rules. However, today (14th), a villager named Xu Youfa transported rice to Songjiang and mistakenly reported it to the Jufengchang Rice Mill, claiming that it was purchased by Wu Guihai, who claimed to be from the Yuantong Rice Shop, and had paid a deposit of one yuan. The mill saw that the situation was strange, and after unloading the rice, it was reported to the Rice Industry Association, which investigated the Yuantong Rice Shop for destroying the industry rules and the partner Wu Guihai's illegal rice purchasing behavior. The Yuantong Rice Shop vehemently denied it, so Wu Guihai, the rice purchaser who went to the countryside, was obviously a white racketeer. According to regulations, the association sent a letter to the tooth tax bureau to thoroughly investigate, in order to warn the rest and rectify the industry rules.</p>
<p>Opium Paste Shop to Open Soon</p>
<p>The local Anti-Smoking Committee has approved the application of the Gongji Opium Paste Shop to issue freight documents so that it can go to the warehouse to collect goods and distribute them to opium paste shops in various districts for sale. It is now learned that the operating license for the opium paste shop in the first district has been approved by the provincial capital, Taili. The operating licenses for the opium paste shops in the remaining seven districts have all been issued. Now that the opium paste shop has shipped its goods, the opening date of the opium paste shops in various places should not be far off.</p>

<p>Robbery with Injury in Tangjiaqiao</p>
<p>Last night, more than a dozen bandits suddenly broke into the home of Shen Jinxiang in Tangjiaqiao, District Three, and looted everything. Before leaving, they injured Shen Jinxiang in the head with an iron rod, and his injuries were quite serious. At the same time, they went to the home of Hu Yinlin, who worked as a fortune teller, and thoroughly searched and looted, resulting in irreparable losses. His daughter, Longzhu, a recent widow at home, had her lower body burned with candles by the robbers, which was a terrible sight to behold.</p>

<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Universal Reduction of Land Tax by Two Percent Throughout the County</p>
<p>This year, the county experienced a drought. The county government sent officials to various villages and towns to survey the autumn crops, and also requested the Civil and Financial Affairs Departments to send officials to re-survey. At the same time, the county government submitted the drought situation to the Finance Department for review and decision. It was calculated that there were more than 148,160 acres of completely barren land with no harvest, and a request was made for a universal reduction of 13 percent. It is now learned that after receiving the report, the Finance Department proposed to the Provincial Government Committee to amend the seventh article of the "Measures for Surveying and Reporting Disasters and Deficiencies" regarding the exemption of gold and barren land tax, and issued a circular for compliance. It should be handled in accordance with the amended article and must not be unlimited. Therefore, yesterday, it specially instructed Strict County Magistrate of the county to thoroughly investigate and carefully screen the land, separately categorizing increases and decreases. The highest limit should be no more than a two percent reduction in the total harvest of the entire county, including the completely barren land, and an actual tax collection of eight percent must be determined before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Kidnappers from Yixing Arrested in Wuxi</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of Yixing County recently arrested twelve kidnappers. According to their confessions, there were still accomplices named Shi Zuoqing and Shi Du氏 who were hiding in Ximen, Wuxi. The Bureau immediately sent a constable with a warrant to Wuxi and directly reported to the local Public Security Bureau, requesting them to send personnel to assist in the arrest. After Chen, the Bureau Chief, approved the letter, he ordered Zhong Jihe, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team, to send Zhang Biao, an investigator, to arrest the suspects at the address. They arrested Shi Zuoqing and his wife in a workshop outside Ximen and temporarily detained them at the Bureau.

<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Inaugural Meeting of the Canal Engineering Bureau Evaluation Council</p>
<p>After the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau was re-established in Yangzhou, Director Xu believed that if the evaluation councils previously organized in the Xu, Hai, Huai, and Yang prefectures under its jurisdiction were not also re-established, it would be insufficient to gather opinions and broaden benefits. Therefore, he submitted a request to the Provincial Government to continue to appoint local gentry who were familiar with water conservancy in each county, and schedule a meeting to discuss improvements. The Provincial Government approved the request. The meeting was scheduled for the 14th and 15th of this month. As of the 13th, those who had arrived to report included Zhou Yiren from Jiangdu, Han Guojun from Taixian, Ma Shijie from Gaoyou, Shi Jinsheng from Xinghua, Xu Xinwu from Yizheng, Feng Xiaoting from Pei County, Ding Ximin from Xiao County, Liu Shulun from Suqian, Bei Yunqi from Suining, Feng Beiying from Pi County, Wu Tongju from Guanyun, Xu Baoyu from Muyang, Chen Deru from Siyang, Hao Xingheng from Yancheng, and Chen Bomeng from Funing, totaling sixteen people.

<p>Autumn Harvest Fixed at 85 Percent</p>
<p>Since the summer of this year, the county has experienced a prolonged drought, and the crops have withered, resulting in an autumn harvest of less than 40 percent. After the county government reported to the Provincial Department and sent personnel to inspect, it reported 70 percent. Local people believed that the people's strength could not bear the burden, and they successively submitted requests for reduction. However, the Department of Finance still considered the number too small and ordered the county to increase it appropriately. The county government then convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies and groups, who all said that the disaster situation this year was extremely severe and unprecedented in a century. In order to balance the interests of the country and the people, it was reluctantly proposed to collect 60 percent and submit it to the Provincial Department for approval. Yesterday (11th), an telegram was received from the Department of Finance, stating that the autumn harvest in the county was not a major disaster and that the request could not be approved. According to the proposals of the autumn survey committee, 15 percent was added to fix the collection at 85 percent. Local officials were shocked by the news and held a meeting that night to jointly submit a request for reduction and send representatives to the province to petition.</p>
<p>Cai Hongsheng's Wife Kidnapped</p>

At the time, Cai was out and not at home. The bandits twisted and beat Cai's wife, Chen, and forced her to hand over silver dollars, but failed. They then kidnapped her and left.

<p>Our newspaper's General Manager, Mr. Shi Liangcai, accompanied by his wife, son, niece, and his son Yonggeng's classmate, Deng Zuxun, and others, departed from Qiushui Villa in West Lake at approximately 2:00 pm the day before yesterday (the 13th) in his own car, number 5599, driven by the chauffeur Huang Jincai, to return to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. However, at approximately 3:00 pm, when the car was passing Wengjiabu at Dazhakou, the intersection of Hangzhou and Haining counties, a Buick car was discovered ahead. Six or seven thugs blocked the road and fired box cannons head-on. The chauffeur and Deng Zuxun were killed on the spot. Although General Manager Shi immediately got out of the car and fled upon seeing the opportunity, he was ultimately killed by the thugs due to his age and lack of strength. Mrs. Shi was injured in a fall while fleeing, and her niece was also hit by a bullet in her left leg when bullets were flying. Only his son, Yonggeng, got out of the car and ran backward as fast as he could when the thugs were shooting the chauffeur and Deng. Although three thugs followed closely behind and fired remotely, he managed to avoid disaster due to his speed. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs immediately took their original car and fled towards Hangzhou. Afterwards, Yonggeng requested that a car be sent from the Jianqiao Aviation School to the scene of the incident, and Mrs. Shi and her niece were rescued back to Hangzhou for medical treatment. After arriving in Hangzhou, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Municipal Government, together with the Hangzhou County Local Court, dispatched cars late at night to transport the three bodies back to Hangzhou. Shanghai also dispatched personnel that night and the hearse from the Wan Gu Funeral Home rushed to Hangzhou overnight to transport the bodies back to Shanghai, arriving at the residence on Hartung Road yesterday afternoon at 4:30 pm to prepare for the funeral. The police authorities of Zhejiang and Shanghai are now making every effort to investigate the murderers. Mrs. Shi and her son Yonggeng also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 8:00 pm to handle all the post-mortem arrangements. The detailed circumstances of this incident are recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>The Arrival of Mr. Shi Liangcai's Remains at the Residence (Zhu Shunlin)</p>
<p>Head-on Shooting</p>
<p>According to our reporter's accurate investigation, the detailed circumstances of the encounter are supplemented as follows: At approximately 2:00 pm on the 13th, Mr. Shi and his wife, son Yonggeng, and others took their own car from Hangzhou and returned to Shanghai along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. There were a total of six people in the car. The chauffeur, Huang Jincai, Yonggeng's classmate, Deng Zuxun, and Yonggeng were sitting in the front row, while Mr. Shi and his wife and the third young lady were in the car compartment. At approximately 3:00 pm, the car passed Qiaosi and reached about two li north of Wengjiabu Station. From a distance, they saw a Buick car, number Jingzi 72, model 1929, parked on the side of the road. Six or seven men in black were standing next to the car, and their attitude was very suspicious. At that time, the car was traveling very fast. When they were more than ten feet away, they suddenly heard a whistle. The six or seven thugs next to the car all took out box cannons and fired at the Shi's car head-on.</p>
<p>Three Bandits Relentlessly Pursue</p>
<p>The chauffeur, Huang Jincai, seeing the disaster, quickly leaned over to hide while stepping on the brakes. Due to the speed of the car, there was a sudden loud noise, and the car stopped right where the thugs were standing. At that moment, bullets were flying, and the front windshield shattered into pieces. Deng Zuxun, a classmate next to the chauffeur, was also extremely frightened and prostrated. At this critical moment, Yonggeng saw the imminent danger, quickly opened the car door and jumped out, turning around and running along the highway towards Hangzhou. Three bandits chased after him, firing dozens of shots, none of which hit him. Yonggeng was wearing a coat, which made running very difficult. He quickly took off his coat midway and threw it into the field, rushing forward for his life. Two of the three bandits ran out of strength and fell behind, with only one bandit pursuing relentlessly, but no longer firing. It seemed that the bullets had run out. After a while, Yonggeng was also exhausted. The last bandit had chased him to his back. In desperation, Yonggeng suddenly turned around and asked why he was being chased relentlessly. The bandit replied, "You come with me," and tried his best to pull the trigger, but the bullet did not come out. Then he grabbed Yonggeng's wrist. Yonggeng shook him off with force and grabbed the barrel of the box cannon he was holding. The bandit also tried to snatch it with force. The barrel was slippery, and it was eventually taken away. The barrel had triangular spikes, causing Yonggeng's palm to be injured and bleeding profusely. Seeing that it was not easy to deal with, the bandit turned around and fled. Yonggeng feared that the bandit would reunite with his accomplices and come back, so he reluctantly ran to Wengjiabu Station to call for help.</p>
<p>Shot in Vital Parts</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Shi, his wife, and the third young lady opened the right car door and fled, going downhill towards the countryside. Two bandits chased Mr. Shi and others. After walking about half a li, Mr. Shi fled into the home of a farmer surnamed Shen. One bandit tracked him inside, while the other bandit went around to the back door to wait. When Mr. Shi rushed out of the back door, he was shot in the foot by the bandit. He still endured the pain and crawled a few steps to a dry small pond, where he fell to the ground. The two bandits fired two more shots at his head, one entering the brain through the mouth and the other entering through the left ear, both hitting vital parts, and he died immediately. As for the third young lady, she was shot in the leg and fell to the side of the road. One bandit was about to shoot her again, but stopped after she begged for mercy. Mrs. Shi was injured when she rolled down the slope. After the bandits left in the car, the third young lady shouted loudly to the villagers for help, and they were helped to rest in a farmer's home.</p>
<p>Bandit Car Speeding Away</p>
<p>Yonggeng, with effort, ran to Wengjiabu Station, already too tired to move. At that time, the villagers were asking questions in panic, inquiring about the details of the encounter. As they were talking, they saw the bandit car speeding towards Hangzhou from a distance. Yonggeng was shocked, thinking that the bandits were coming to attack, and ran away to the countryside. In the blink of an eye, the bandit car passed by and drove away. Yonggeng's frightened soul had just settled, and he returned to the station. He telegraphed Qiaosi Station from the station, and Yonggeng was carried to Jianqiao Airfield by a villager in a small cart. He met the instructors of the Aviation School and told them the details. The instructors immediately telegraphed to all parties to inform them, and sent more than a dozen armed guards to accompany Yonggeng to the scene of the incident for rescue. The policemen of the Public Security Bureau had already arrived after the telephone report from the third young lady, and learned that Mr. Shi, Deng Zuxun, and the chauffeur had been killed. The ambulance from the Aviation School then transported the injured Mrs. Shi and the third young lady to Hangzhou, and Yonggeng also went along. After the bodies of Mr. Shi and others underwent forensic examination procedures, they were transported back to Hangzhou until approximately 4:00 am yesterday.</p>
<p>Body Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>After receiving the report the night before, Mr. Ma Yinliang, the manager of our newspaper, immediately gathered important staff of the newspaper at the Shi's residence to discuss all the post-mortem arrangements with the family. At 8:30 pm, he took three cars, accompanied by Huang Yanqing, Huang Zijian, Huang Renzhi, and Wang Yingbin from the General Management Office, and at the same time instructed the Wan Gu Funeral Home to send a foreigner and a hearse to Hangzhou to transport the body back to Shanghai. After arriving in Hangzhou at 3:00 am yesterday, he went to Tingyun Villa, where the foreigner washed Mr. Shi's body and gave him an embalming injection. Then, together with the bodies of Deng Zuxun and Zhang Jincai, he set off for Shanghai at 8:00 am yesterday, arriving at the Wan Gu Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 1:30 pm. The technicians of the funeral home performed surgery to wash and make up the body, and then at approximately 5:00 pm, the body was transported by the hearse to the residence on Hartung Road. Then, two foreigners from the funeral home moved the body to the prepared memorial seat in the old house's hall.</p>
<p>Family Members Mourn</p>
<p>After the body was placed, the red satin covering the face was removed by the foreigners. At this time, all the men, women, young and old of the family surrounded the body and mourned bitterly, and all the old friends and colleagues of the newspaper also wept and cried uncontrollably. The body of Mr. Shi, after being made up by the technicians, although his face was pale, still seemed to have a slight smile, but his ears were slightly purple, and his mouth and eyes were closed as if he were asleep.</p>
<p>Guests Sign Their Names</p>
<p>Those who went to the Shi's residence yesterday afternoon to offer condolences included Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting, Chen Taoyi, Zhu Qinglan, Pan Gongzhan, Yang Hu, Du Yuesheng, Wu Xingya, Huang Renzhi, Chen Lengxue, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Zhuping, Wu Yunqi, Chen Guangfu, Wang Boqi, Yan Fuqing, Li Dachao, Mu Ouchu, Guo Shun, Lin Kanghou, and many others, as well as all the staff and workers of our newspaper, who all went to pay their respects to the deceased, and were all saddened to tears. They all bowed to the spirit. In addition, Takeshi Kinoshita, the Shanghai correspondent of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, and Hakuhaku Hata, the president of the Shanghai Daily, personally came to the newspaper to leave their business cards to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Family Members Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mrs. Shi and her son Yonggeng took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Shanghai at 2:00 pm yesterday. When Yonggeng and others came to Shanghai, they were closely protected by road police and bodyguards to prevent accidents. They arrived safely at the residence at 7:30 pm in the evening. Mrs. Shi suffered severe hemoptysis due to the shock during the incident, so she was examined by a doctor after arriving at the residence. Ms. Shen Lijuan, the niece who was also injured at the same time the day before yesterday, is currently staying temporarily at Guangji Hospital in Hangzhou, and will return to Shanghai after she recovers from her injuries. The bodies of Deng Zuxun and Huang Jincai were transported to Shanghai at the same time as Mr. Shi's body and are scheduled to be encoffined tomorrow at the Chinese Funeral Home. The body of the chauffeur, Jincai, will be encoffined at the Wan Gu Funeral Home.</p>
<p>Encoffining Ceremony Tomorrow</p>
<p>The family has decided to hold the encoffining ceremony at 2:00 pm on the 16th of this month, and then schedule the memorial service and funeral. The encoffining location will be held in the garden of the Shi's residence. A large tent was set up overnight last night for use. The Shi's residence formally announced the obituary to relatives and friends last night.</p>

<p>Official Pursuit of the Culprits</p>
<p>After the incident, the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched police to rigorously pursue and apprehend the perpetrators. However, the thugs had already escaped without a trace, making it impossible to capture them. Efforts are currently underway to apprehend them. Furthermore, upon receiving the information, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau has dispatched a large number of detectives and police officers to conduct investigations and check pedestrians at major transportation routes and stations. Also, because the license plate of the car used by the thugs was "Jingshi 72," the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has been specifically requested via telegram to thoroughly investigate in order to apprehend the culprits and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Eyewitness Account by a Westerner</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the incident, a foreign electrical engineer from this city, Mr. Stephen Heller, was also returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou. His car passed the border between Haining and Hangzhou just minutes after Mr. Shi was murdered. According to Mr. Stephen: "I left Hangzhou at 3 PM yesterday. There were not many vehicles on the road, so I was driving very fast. After driving fifteen miles (about one mile from Jianqiao Aviation School), I saw a car stopped by the side of the road, surrounded by many soldiers and civilians. The road was blocked. I got out of the car." The car stopped by the side of the road was a brand-new Studebaker private car. The two front lights were on, but the third front light had been destroyed. The front wheels and tires had also been punctured. I looked into the car, and a terrifying scene immediately came into view. The driver and another young man (namely, Deng) were lying stiffly in the front seat, bleeding profusely. The seat cushions were soaked in blood. There was also a lot of blood on the road. At this time, doctors from Hangzhou had arrived at the scene to provide medical attention. I inspected the car again and saw that the wheels had been damaged, but the car body was still intact. The details of the incident varied from person to person. According to some, a car drove past the Studebaker car, first puncturing the tires, then killing the driver, and forcing the car to stop. I was taking pictures at this time, and laborers were carrying another body. I then got back in my car and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Niece's Injuries</p>
<p>A telegram from Hangzhou stated that the niece, Ms. Shen Lijuan, who is being treated at Guangji Hospital, had a bullet removed from her left leg muscle yesterday. Her condition has gradually returned to normal, and she is able to walk on her own today. However, the doctors have instructed her to rest due to the deep shock she experienced. She is expected to be discharged from the hospital in about two months.</p>
<p>Apprehension of a Suspect</p>
<p>A telegram from Hangzhou stated that at 1 PM today (the 14th), railway police at Zhuji Station on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway apprehended a suspect in the Shi case, named Tang Baoying. He was found to be carrying a handgun. He is currently detained at the county Public Security Bureau and will be escorted to Hangzhou tomorrow morning (today). Since the case occurred, the Provincial Public Security Bureau has telegraphed Beijing to inquire about the owner of the car with license plate "Jingshi 72." According to a reply telegram from the Beijing Municipal Public Works Bureau, the car with license plate "72" belongs to the Yanye Bank and is still in Nanjing. Furthermore, according to a Nanjing telegram from the Central News Agency on the 14th, the car used by the thugs had a "Jing" license plate number 72 for test vehicles. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired with the Beijing Public Works Bureau on the morning of the 14th. According to the staff member in charge of car license plates, the Beijing government issues five types of car license plates: (1) black plate with white characters for private cars; (2) white plate with black characters for commercial vehicles; (3) white plate with a blue diagonal stripe and red characters for test vehicles; (4) yellow plate with black characters for commercial trucks; and (5) black plate with yellow characters for private trucks. Of these five types, only the black plate for private cars has the number "72." The other four types do not. The black plate number 72 belongs to the Yanye Bank in this city. This morning, the 14th, the car and the driver were brought to the municipal government for verification. It was learned that the car had not left Beijing in the past two days. The reporter then asked if the test vehicle license plate number 27 had been issued. After checking, the staff member showed the reporter the license plate, stating that the number had not been issued recently. As for the test vehicle license plate number 72, there is no such number at all.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Rice Industry Leaders Discuss Grain Panic in This City <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Estimated Inventory Can Ensure a Safe Passage This Year</p>
<p>Eager to Purchase Imported Rice, but Difficult to Maintain Low Prices Due to Heavy Taxes</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that this year's widespread drought in various parts of our country has led to an unprecedented grain panic, with soaring prices. Yesterday, reporters from the New Voice News Agency specially visited Mr. Gu Xinyi and Mr. Jiang Shizhi, leaders of the grain industry in this city, who kindly gave interviews, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Production Halved, Supply Cannot Meet Demand</p>
<p>According to Mr. Gu Xinyi, this year, the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have been affected by drought, resulting in a sharp decline in production. Jiangsu's output is half of what it was in previous years, Zhejiang's is only 40%, and Jiangxi's is the same. Anhui is better than Zhejiang and Jiangxi, with an average harvest of only 50%. Therefore, the province, which usually has a surplus of food, is now experiencing a fear of supply not meeting demand.</p>
<p>Ordered 1.5 Million Bags of Imported Rice</p>
<p>Due to the supply not meeting the demand, the rice industry and speculative financial industry have successively ordered imported rice from Saigon, Rangoon, and Bangkok, totaling over 1.5 million bags to date. Besides the 250,000 bags that have already been imported, there are another 150,000 bags scheduled to be imported in November and December. The rest are futures contracts for the first half of the new year, mainly sold to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and other places for disaster prevention and military needs. Sales in Shanghai are only a small portion.</p>
<p>Drought Wreaks Havoc, Rice Ears Shrivel</p>
<p>Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Zhujiajiao in Jiangsu, and Jiaxing, Ningbo, Jiashan, and other places in Zhejiang, were originally rice-producing areas. Due to the prolonged drought, coupled with shriveled rice ears (normally, every 100 catties of grain can yield 5 dou of rice, but now it only yields a little over 4 dou), the harvest is also reduced. As a result, the price of new rice, which was expected to fall, remains stubbornly high. Some merchants in Shanghai are even buying imported rice to prevent a shortage of local sales.</p>
<p>No Worries This Year, Panic Next Year</p>
<p>Mr. Gu also said that the reason for the high rice prices in Shanghai is mainly due to the drought, as well as farmers hoarding grain. In previous years, they would sell off all their grain, but now they only sell a small portion. Businesses hoard it, waiting for a good price. They also reduce the amount transported to Shanghai. In addition, there are many speculators who buy as much as possible, manipulating the market, making it difficult for prices to fall. Currently, the sales in Shanghai and the amount arriving from the surrounding countryside can offset each other. There are 100,000 dan of imported rice in storage, 30,000 dan of local rice in the South City, and 40,000 dan in the North City. The people's food supply this year is guaranteed, but next year, a panic is inevitable.</p>
<p>Flour Shortage, Imported Wheat Transactions</p>
<p>As for flour, the price has been rising recently due to the shortage of goods. The Hua Feng Flour Mill purchased two ships of imported wheat from Argentina yesterday, at a price of 4.80 yuan per 100 catties. The Li Xin Flour Mill ordered one ship from Australia, at a price of 9 yuan per 100 catties, totaling 25,000 tons. The Australian goods are expected to be shipped to Shanghai around December 2nd, and the Argentine goods will arrive in Shanghai in mid-January next year. It is understood that the flour industry will continue to place orders to prevent a market shortage.</p>
<p>Sparse Inventory in Surrounding Countryside, Less Than Half Sufficient</p>
<p>According to Jiang Shizhi, the inventory in the surrounding countryside is very low. Wuxi alone has over 100,000 dan of stored old rice, 100,000 dan of new rice, and 40,000 dan of japonica rice. In total, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have 1 million dan of rice in stock (excluding what is harvested). Based on the production and sales of the two provinces, this is less than half sufficient. Hunan province, after meeting its own sales needs, has a surplus that can offset a quarter of the shortage in the two provinces. As for Anhui province, it also has a surplus. In the past, it was purchased from Guangdong, but since the seizure of relief rice at Dashengguan, the transportation of Anhui rice to Guangdong has ceased because of overestimation and overtaxation.</p>
<p>Guangdong Procures Imported Rice with Half the Tax, Ships It to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang also said that as for purchasing imported rice, the Shanghai rice industry had requested the government to reduce import taxes but was unsuccessful. Every stone is taxed at 3.4 yuan, which, combined with the cost, makes it unprofitable to sell, making it difficult to lower rice prices. Guangdong province procures Saigon rice with only half the tax, so merchants in Guangdong are frantically purchasing imported rice and plan to ship it to Shanghai to avoid taxes. It is said that over 100,000 stones are already en route. According to this year's situation, except for Jiangbei, which is self-sufficient, the shortfall in Jiangnan can be safely overcome.</p>
<p>Key to Adjusting People's Food Supply Lies in Taxes</p>
<p>Although more than one million stones of imported rice will be imported next year, the vast drought-stricken areas mean that this is just a drop in the bucket and not enough to distribute. The future is worrisome. If the government can halve or exempt the import tax on imported rice, rice merchants can order as much imported rice as possible to suppress the panic of domestic rice and regulate the people's food supply. Therefore, the important key to whether there will be a rice shortage next year depends entirely on whether the government can exempt and reduce taxes.</p>

<p>Negotiating Mortgage of Zhejiang Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Public Bonds are being printed by the Shanghai Datong Bookstore. By the end of this month, they will be completely printed and transported to Hangzhou for distribution by the Zhejiang Department of Finance. Director Wang Chengying previously went to Beijing to explain the Zhejiang Public Bond Regulations to the Legislative Yuan. After it was passed, he arrived in Shanghai on the 10th of this month to negotiate a mortgage loan with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Real Estate Bank, Jincheng Bank, Continental Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Salt Industry Bank, and other banks.</p>
<p>Principles Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the banking community and learned that Director Wang has been meeting with leaders of various banks in Shanghai in recent days to negotiate a mortgage loan. He plans to use the Jiangsu Public Bond mortgage method, mortgaging the 20 million yuan bonds at 60% to obtain 12 million yuan. The banks have agreed in principle to the mortgage, but the amount, interest rate, term, and other conditions have not been negotiated. It is generally hoped that it can be realized. It is said that Director Wang will return to Hangzhou within days and come to Shanghai again by the end of this month to negotiate contracts and other matters.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Merits During His Lifetime <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>After the tragic news of Mr. Wen's death spread, social groups, merchants, and the public all mourned deeply. This was because Mr. Wen was diligent in his service, upheld integrity, and only served for two years and three months. However, he reformed the police administration with remarkable achievements. The peace and order of the locality was something rarely seen in recent years. As for police reforms, the most prominent ones included the reform of the sub-bureaus, the erection of police monuments, the construction of police cemeteries, the restoration of police training schools, the replenishment of weapons, the addition of uniforms, the creation of police death relief and employee death benefits, the establishment of police savings, and the construction of a new headquarters. All of these facilities were completed during Mr. Wen's tenure. He was truly meritorious. Many police officers in the bureau were moved to tears upon hearing the tragic news, which shows how deeply Mr. Wen's life affected people.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Last Will and Testament <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wen’s relatives and friends speaking with a reporter, Director Wen was of a robust constitution. This past autumn, he initially suffered from dysentery, followed by a relapse of old ailments. He was immediately admitted to a Chinese-Western sanatorium for treatment. He improved slightly half a month prior, and went to a sanatorium in West Shanghai to recuperate. Unexpectedly, his condition worsened, ultimately leading to his demise, which is deeply regretted. Before his passing, he was still mentally lucid. Mayor Wu, Naval Department Director Chen Ce, his uncle Wen, Division Commander Chao Ji, Chief Secretary Sun Zhongying, Section Chief Lin Wenquan, and family members were all at his side. Mr. Wen was still able to bid them farewell one by one. He first expressed his gratitude for Mayor Wu’s support and kindness throughout his life, expressing regret that he was unable to repay this kindness, which he considered a great regret. He repeatedly urged his younger siblings to carry on his legacy, follow the leadership of their predecessors, and alleviate the national crisis. Finally, he said to his uncle, Division Commander Wen Chaoji, and his close friend Chen Ce, "I am a revolutionary soldier and have long dedicated myself to the country. Although I have been wounded many times, unfortunately, I will not die on the battlefield, but instead will die in bed, which is not my wish. Currently, the national crisis has not been resolved, lost territories have not been recovered, and the communist bandits have not been completely annihilated, which is the responsibility of those who survive," and so on. Even as he spoke to this point, his spirit did not wane. He continued to instruct his family on household matters in an orderly fashion. Finally, he instructed Chief Secretary Sun and Section Chief Lin, as well as his family, to have his handwritten "Zhu Zi's Family Precepts" printed in collotype and sent to relatives, friends, and colleagues as a memento. He was able to arrange such trivial matters one by one, which is quite rare. His concern for national affairs and constant thoughts of saving the country are particularly thought-provoking.</p>

Please convey my condolences to his sister-in-law and nephews. Respectfully, Xie Shou Kang." Also, the Nanjing Qiongyai Association in Beijing telegraphed, "To the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, condolences to the family of Director Wen: I was shocked to read in the newspaper that Director Wen had passed away due to illness. We deeply mourn his passing. This association respectfully sends its condolences on behalf of all the Qiongyai people in Beijing. Respectfully, Qiongyai Association in Beijing." Furthermore, Mr. Arnold, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, sent a letter to Mayor Wu yesterday (the 14th) expressing condolences on the death of Director Wen Hongen. The letter stated, "Director Wen has worked steadily and cooperatively for the common interests of the two districts for two years. All the directors and staff of the Municipal Council greatly admire him. We are deeply saddened by his sudden passing. On behalf of the Municipal Council, we extend our condolences to his family."</p>

<p>Agreed Loan Amounts from Various Banks</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shaanxi Provincial Government is borrowing 1.5 million from five banks including the Shanghai Central Bank to fund the project to divert water from the Wei River to build the Wei Hui Canal.

According to a reporter’s sources, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will jointly lend 350,000, while the Shanghai Jin Cheng and Yien Yieh Commercial Banks will each lend 450,000. The loan contract has been drafted by the Central Bank and will be formally signed after another round of discussions with the banks. However, it is reported that the representative in charge of Jin Cheng Bank has left Shanghai due to business, so the meeting has been postponed and a formal signing has yet to take place.</p>

All first and second-class cabins were chartered by the Yousheng Travel Group for tourism purposes, so no passenger tickets were sold yesterday. The ship is scheduled to stop for one day at each port, allowing passengers to disembark and tour at their leisure. In the future, after the ship returns to Shanghai, it will be officially scheduled to operate on the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangzhou route.</p>

<p>Remarks by Colonel Fairbank</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," Colonel Fairbank, former president of the International Olympic Games, is an inventor and economist. He invented a machine gun that can write symbols in the air, like a person signing a commemorative album. Mr. Fairbank recently represented the United States at the Tokyo International Red Cross Conference and is now in Shanghai, residing at the Cathay Hotel. He recently discussed military preparations and current issues with colleagues. Mr. Fairbank's invention is a type of sound detector that was used during the European War to locate the gathering of artillery units and the location of ships. Because Mr. Fairbank's device was used to kill people, he did not accept any compensation for it, but instead donated it to the United States and its allies. When asked about his machine gun yesterday, Mr. Fairbank replied that each cannon has a different sound and can be identified by the waves it emits on the telegraph wire. After discussing this, Mr. Fairbank discussed economic issues with the guests, stating that even if Shanghai does not become the largest city in the world in fifty years, it will become one of the world's most famous cities.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance Promises to Forward the Opinions to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>According to the "Newspaper," the Shanghai Banking Association and the Banking Law Research Association have concluded their work. The research findings, along with supporting reasons, total about eleven or twelve articles. Among them, three or four are the most important [the rest are common]. In particular, Article 5 of the Banking Law, which states that "shareholders of limited liability companies, and limited and joint-stock companies, shall be liable for twice the amount of their subscribed shares," is the most important. This has now been approved by the 58th Executive Committee of the Banking Association and was submitted to the Legislative Yuan's Ministry of Finance the night before yesterday, offering their opinions and requesting adoption. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Banking Association, and others met with Xu Kan, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, the governing body, in Shanghai to present their opinions and request that efforts be made to remedy the situation when drafting the implementing regulations of the Banking Law. Director Xu stated that the Ministry of Finance had no authority to amend the Banking Law but promised to forward it to the Legislative Yuan for review. It is reported that Chen Guangfu and others may visit Director Xu again, still requesting that efforts be made to remedy the situation when drafting the implementing regulations of the Banking Law.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Tax Bureau Requesting that Tobacco Merchants be Allowed to Pay Taxes with Certificates <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "To whom it may concern: On the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the local raw silk tobacco industry association stating that, according to members such as Jiang Wanchang and Jiang Dachang, since the implementation of the special tax, merchants have complied with the regulations and paid taxes, reporting and transporting goods for over a year, which has been convenient. However, recently, tobacco silk imported from Xiamen has been found to have blurred stamps on the boxes, or mismatched stamp numbers. The Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau has ordered them to pay supplementary taxes, or even imposed fines. The merchants are in a hurry to sell the goods and are afraid of being fined, so they reluctantly paid the supplementary taxes. Tobacco silk is transported from Yongding, Fujian, to Shanghai, covering thousands of miles by land and water. The bamboo boxes are already damaged from being moved and bumped along the way, let alone the fragile paper stamps. The mismatched stamp numbers are because the tobacco silk is transported from Yongding to Zhangzhou, where it is then transferred to the merchants, who apply to the local tax bureau to pay the special tax. Since the number of goods received and transferred by the transferring merchants is large, and the number of merchants entrusting the transfer is also large, it is inevitable that there will be negligence when affixing the stamps. The local tax bureau, understanding the difficulties of the transferring merchants, does not scrutinize minor errors in the stamps when inspecting exports. Now, one party is considering the difficulties of the merchants and is lenient in allowing passage, while the other party is creating difficulties and imposing fines. Tax bureaus under the same national government have such contradictory practices, which go against the government's intention to facilitate merchants. Moreover, in fact, the tax certificate is the proof of tax payment, and the stamp is only to assist in verifying whether the tax has been paid. We request that the tax bureau not make unnecessary demands, consider the merchants' situation, and use the tax certificate as proof, not imposing fines based on the stamp. Furthermore, recently, the reporting and inspection of imported tobacco silk has taken a long time, affecting business, which is not insignificant. The association was instructed to submit a request to your association to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. After inquiring, it was found that when merchants transport tobacco to Shanghai, they pay the special tax in the local area according to regulations, obtain a tax certificate, and then affix the stamp to the surface of the goods. After inspection, the goods are allowed to be exported. The merchants have fulfilled their tax obligations, and the tax bureau has completed its audit responsibilities. When the goods arrive in Shanghai, checking whether there is a tax certificate accompanying the goods is sufficient to prevent smuggling. For goods that already have a tax certificate, it is unreasonable to demand supplementary taxes or impose fines on the grounds of blurred stamps or mismatched numbers. We believe that there is a need to improve the handling of this. Accordingly, we are writing to your office to request that you approve the above requests to alleviate the merchants' difficulties."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Association of Machine Factories Issues a Notice Soliciting Opinions from Various Factories on Insurance Issues <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Locally-Made Goods Machine Factories issued a notice yesterday soliciting opinions from various factories regarding factory insurance. The original text reads: "To whom it may concern: Factory insurance is intended to reduce burdens and protect against occasional dangers. However, insurance companies established by Chinese merchants often reinsure with foreign companies. The so-called 'adjusters' are completely biased and collude with insurance companies. Moreover, their regulations are mainly in English, which is contrary to Chinese commercial contracts. How can factory owners who have fire insurance obtain fair treatment? For example, the tragedy at Taiyi Factory occurred in August. The factory repeatedly contacted the insurance company, but the insurance company claimed that it had not received a report from the adjuster and has not yet indicated whether it will pay compensation, which is obviously unfair. The way to provide disaster relief is to be swift. The measures taken by these insurance companies are disappointing. Therefore, our association has resolved to organize an insurance committee to help plan, which is our duty. In order to gather information for reference, please provide the following information: 1. The name of the insurance company that provides fire insurance and the amount of the premium. 2. The circumstances of any past fires and whether compensation was paid. 3. Insurance experience and personal opinions on insurance law. Please provide your valuable advice on the above three points so that we can collect ideas and achieve the practical benefits of insurance. As this matter concerns the vital interests of the factory, we hereby request that you investigate and reply. We look forward to your reply."</p>

The registration and exchange methods will be sent to your federation after they are finalized, and you are to notify the chambers of commerce in each province and city to instruct the chambers of commerce in each county to comply.

<p>Shanghai City and County jointly own grain reserves and property. The conference of representatives from the city and county to change the area has been held repeatedly without any results. Now, the Municipal Government has ordered the reorganization of the Evaluation Committee to survey and divide the grain reserves.

The general situation has already been decided. However, the City's previous proposal was to estimate the price and sell the property, with the City and County dividing the funds, while the County proposed to divide the property. The City's latest instructions did not specify this point clearly. The statement that the Shanghai Hospital should also be assigned to the City is also very brief. In addition to the County appointing a representative to reply to the Municipal Finance Bureau and schedule a meeting, it is proposed to discuss the following principles: 1. The County still proposes to jointly survey the two properties, estimate the price, and divide the property and manage it according to the City and County's share. 2. Property plots should be pre-matched and evenly divided after valuation, with fertile and barren land balanced. If the value of an irregular plot cannot match the City's 63% and the County's 37% share, the County should request the right to preferentially designate the property to be accepted according to the estimated price, as a right to win the bid. 3. Since the Shanghai Hospital is to be retained by the City, it should be valued uniformly and included in the City's share. 4. Existing property and grain reserve property should be handled in the same way. After the division, if the County's property has already been occupied by the City, it should be transferred immediately. If it is needed in fact and cannot be transferred immediately, a lease agreement should be signed at market value.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, the China Jisheng Society, the World Red Cross, the Bodhi Dharma Assembly, and other four charitable organizations, at the request of the Haining Drought Disaster Relief Association's Shanghai Office, designated specialists to go to Ning to jointly conduct emergency relief. County Magistrate Jiang Huiyue, who also served as the Director of Relief, personally accompanied them to the countryside to conduct investigations. Recently, the charitable organizations and the Haining Drought Relief Association's office have received reports from the directors of relief in various districts stating that the survey showed that nine out of ten homes were empty and the families had nothing. Moreover, since the autumn season, dysentery has been prevalent, and deaths have occurred in succession. New widows are everywhere. These diseases are not incurable, but the survivors of the disaster have no food, let alone medical care. Compared to the Yellow River flood, the scene is even more heartbreaking. All the medicines brought to Ning have been distributed, and due to the wide scope of the disaster and the shortage of funds, it is impossible to proceed without increasing the relief funds. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, etc., believing that the reports of the specialists on the ground are not exaggerated, have already allocated an additional 10,000 yuan to Ning. However, the Haining Drought Disaster Relief Association's Shanghai Office, because the funds for this emergency relief, in addition to the assistance of various charitable organizations and the surplus funds from the Renchen relief, have been advanced. The winter relief and spring relief are difficult to continue. Yesterday, they sent letters to fellow villagers in Shanghai and those who have raised funds in Tianjin, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places, urging them to make efforts to raise funds. They will report the amount of funds raised in advance to plan for the overall situation.</p>

The tea room attendant thought he was just tired and dozing off. It wasn't until about 5:30 that the attendant saw that Li had not woken up. The attendant called out to him but received no response, and realizing that something was wrong, he quickly went downstairs to report to the police, who relayed the report to the City God Temple police station and had Li taken to the hospital for treatment. However, he had already died before he could be taken downstairs.

<p>First Shipment of 300,000 Bags to Shanghai Within the Year</p>
<p>The Annam and Siamese foreign rice purchased by Shanghai's grain merchants is being shipped to Shanghai in succession. However, as Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces are also actively purchasing rice from Shanghai, the supply of arriving foreign rice is deemed insufficient. Therefore, various foreign firms in this port have ordered a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon and Bangkok. Orders have been confirmed for one million bags, which are now being rushed to Shanghai. Shipping companies have been chartered to sail directly to Annam, with 300,000 bags scheduled to arrive this year. The remaining 700,000 bags will be shipped continuously from January of next year.

<p>The Deceased Was Once a Chinese Soldier</p>
<p>Killed for Embezzling Military Pay</p>
<p>Russian national Lavr Lavrov Nikola (transliteration), 34 years old, had recently arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, only about ten days ago. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, around 10 PM, he was suddenly attacked in Lane 855 of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession by a fellow Russian, Piyan Jinxia Guv (transliteration, 29 years old), who pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed him three times in the back before fleeing. After being injured, Lavr sought treatment at the Public Hospital on North Suzhou Road and reported the incident to the French police, who arrested the suspect. Lavr died at the Public Hospital at 0:30 AM on the 13th due to internal injuries. The hospital notified the French police, who transported the body to the Autopsy Department affiliated with the Municipal Council Hospital on Talus Road. Yesterday, the Second Special Court dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor, clerk, interpreter, etc., to the hospital at noon to confirm that the deceased had died from knife wounds sustained during his lifetime. As the deceased had no relatives in Shanghai, the court ordered that the body be buried by the Municipal Council Charity Association. The police then transferred the suspect, Piyan Jinxia Guv, to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court. Judge Cao Jun presided over the hearing. According to the police lawyer, Yao Zhao, the defendant was charged with murder. The police requested an extension as the investigation was not yet complete, and the defendant would be detained pending further investigation. The defendant confessed that he and the deceased had both served in the Chinese army in Shandong. The deceased was the captain, and he was a soldier. He claimed that the deceased embezzled military pay and beat him. After the army disbanded, the deceased fled to Tianjin and other places, and he followed him, determined to seek revenge. The court verified the confession and postponed the trial to the 23rd for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>More Than Two Hundred Coins in Total</p>
<p>Wenzhou natives Wei Yongchang, Wen Baoshan, and Su Yida, used copper coins at the Tianyun Building in the Wing On Company on the evening of the 30th of last month when dealing with small vendors. The vendors, including Xia Defu, noticed and reported it to detectives Pang Ruiqing and Wang Shanqing, who arrested Wei first. Under interrogation, the detectives then arrested Wen and Su in room 45 of the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Five rattan baskets were found in the room. They appeared empty inside, but felt heavy. Upon examination, it was discovered that the baskets had hidden compartments. A total of two hundred and twenty-nine copper coins were discovered in the compartments. They were transferred to the First Special Court. As the confessions of Wei and others were entirely in the Wenzhou dialect and could not be understood, the hearing was postponed to this morning, when the police found an interpreter to translate the confessions into the Shanghai dialect. According to the confessions, the copper coins were purchased from a Sun Baojin for thirty yuan for every hundred yuan in copper coins, which they brought to Shanghai to use. After arguments between the police lawyer Wang Yaotang and the defendant's lawyer, Judge Qian Hongye ordered them to be detained pending sentencing.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I have seen the news in today's edition of your newspaper about the son of Tan Xinyuan and his fiancee Gui Zhen having improper behavior. The news stated that "Yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, just as dawn was breaking, she suddenly called upon the original matchmaker, Ding Meiqing, friend Zhang Fuyuan, her mother Xu Shi, and her foster mother," which is not consistent with the facts. I was unaware of the matter beforehand. At 7:00 AM that morning, Xu Shi, the mother of Tan Ronggui, came to summon me to see the situation. The timing is inconsistent. It is evident that I did not accompany the aforementioned people. I request that you correct the record. Yours sincerely, Ding Meiqing, November 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Special Feature: Several Fundamental Issues of the Chinese Constitution (3) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Recorded by Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>The Five-Yuan System and the President: The five-yuan system of the central government is different in the draft constitution from the current system. Currently, the government is organized by the Kuomintang. The chairman of the current National Government is the head of state, but in reality, he has no power. The draft constitution stipulates that the supreme head of state is the president, who has the highest actual power. Some people believe that the president's power is too high and borders on dictatorship, but the president is elected by the people, and the people have the power to impeach him. At the same time, the Legislative Yuan exercises legislative power, which will not allow the president to become a dictator. If the legislative power is also in the hands of the president, then the president will become the sole holder of both legislative and executive power, which would be dictatorship. Or, if the parliament is the president's parliament, like in Germany, it would also become a dictatorship. In a country ruled by law, if the administrative head has new policies, it needs to promulgate laws. If the budget changes, it must first be approved by the Legislative Yuan before it can be implemented. Otherwise, it cannot be changed. All other laws are the same and cannot be changed. The head of state has a high position in the country, but still needs the consent of the Legislative Yuan to make decisions. The Legislative Yuan is a state organ, and the president is the sole leader of the state, but his policies must be supported by the people and approved by the Legislative Yuan. It cannot be said to be dictatorial politics.</p>
<p>In the future, when the constitution is established and the five-yuan constitution is implemented, the future president will definitely be the leader of the majority party and will naturally be supported by the people. If a party occupies a majority among the people, then the president elected by that party will be approved by the people. The president's policies are subject to the approval of the Legislative Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan will not deliberately make things difficult for the president. The president can then lead the five yuan to work, but the five yuan are not subject to the president's control. For example, we know that Germany and Italy have both formed governments through bloodless revolutions. Mussolini of Italy is the leader of the Fascist Party. Although Mussolini has great power, he is not the emperor. All power does not reside in Mussolini's leadership. The Italian government is organized by the Fascist Party, but when Mussolini decides a policy, it must also be passed by the parliament. It cannot be considered a dictatorship in essence (to be continued).</p>
<h3 id="e158">Discussions From All Sides on Assisting Li Bingyan <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Zhongshan Native Association</p>
<p>Following the incident where female doctor Li Bingyan was nearly indecently assaulted by a foreign ship captain, which concerns the insult of women, all sectors of Shanghai, such as the Women's Alliance, Women's Association, National Medical Association, and other groups, were greatly angered and felt indignant. They convened meetings to discuss countermeasures, as reported in previous issues. It is now known that the Zhongshan Native Association of this port, considering that Ms. Li is a fellow native and unable to remain indifferent, has specially proposed to convene a general meeting of all Zhongshan natives in Shanghai at 8:00 PM today (the 15th) at the Yueqiao Association on Bazilu Road to discuss assistance measures. The announcement of their initiation is recorded below: For the matter of announcement, Ms. Li Bingyan, a female doctor from our county, recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the China Merchants Bureau's Wuyi steamer. During the journey, she was tragically subjected to an attempted indecent assault in her room by the ship's captain (a foreigner). Although Ms. Li was fortunate enough to avoid being defiled, she has suffered a major insult. Insulting Ms. Li is tantamount to insulting the entire women's community of our country and directly infringing upon our fellow natives. If this trend starts, how can we maintain national dignity and uphold justice? Such villains must be severely punished according to the law. Our association is a group of tens of thousands of Zhongshan natives in Shanghai, and we cannot sit idly by witnessing the aforementioned situation. To protect our fellow natives and safeguard the women of our country, it is imperative to provide assistance. This matter was discussed at the fourth regular meeting of our association, and it was resolved that assistance is necessary. It was also resolved to convene a general meeting of fellow natives. It has now been decided to convene a general meeting of Zhongshan natives in Shanghai at 8:00 PM on the evening of the 15th of this month (i.e., Thursday) at the Yueqiao Commercial Federation on Bazilu Road to discuss assistance measures. At that time, we hope that our fellow natives will freely participate, actively attend the meeting, and jointly plan the course of action. In addition to sending a letter to invite Ms. Li Bingyan to personally attend and report, this announcement is hereby made. Published by the Organizing Committee of the Shanghai Zhongshan Native Association, November 14th.</p>
<p>Chinese Medical College Shanghai National Medical Association The Chinese Medical College issued the following letter and telegram yesterday: 1. Express mail telegram to Your Excellency Minister of Transportation: We have received a statement from Ms. Li Bingyan, a member of our association and a graduate of our college, stating that on the 4th of this month, she traveled from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the China Merchants Bureau's Wuyi steamer. When the ship docked in Shantou, the ship's captain, a Norwegian named Norguistott, forcibly pried open her door and attempted an indecent assault. He was spotted and stopped. Unexpectedly, on the second night, he still secretly went to the original room to plot wrongdoing. Fortunately, she had reported this to the acting second mate of the ship, Zhang Huoyan, who switched rooms, thus avoiding the disaster. Considering that the China Merchants Bureau is a state-owned shipping bureau under your jurisdiction, it is unacceptable to allow foreign crew members to commit such indecent acts, which undermines the safety of travelers and damages national dignity. We hereby telegram Your Excellency Minister, requesting you to promptly order the China Merchants Bureau to investigate, dismiss, and severely punish the perpetrator to deter evildoers. This is our earnest plea. Shanghai National Medical Association Chinese Medical College, respectfully. 2. Letter to the China Merchants Bureau: We are writing to you that we have received a statement from Ms. Li Bingyan, a member of our association and a graduate of our college, stating that on the 4th of this month, she traveled from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the China Merchants Bureau's Wuyi steamer. When the ship docked in Shantou, the ship's captain, a Norwegian named Norguistott, forcibly pried open her door and attempted an indecent assault. He was spotted and stopped. Unexpectedly, on the second night, he still secretly went to the original room to plot wrongdoing. Fortunately, she had reported this to the acting second mate of the ship, Zhang Huoyan, who switched rooms, thus avoiding the disaster. This is outrageous. Your bureau is a state-owned enterprise, and you should ensure the safety of travelers and maintain your reputation. Ms. Li's report has been verified by acting second mate Zhang. If it is true, and you do not severely dismiss and punish the perpetrator, how will your bureau face the passengers and how will you protect national dignity? We hereby send this letter to request that your bureau promptly investigate and severely punish the perpetrator to safeguard your shipping reputation. This is in the public interest. Respectfully addressed to General Manager Liu of the China Merchants Bureau. Shanghai National Medical Association Chinese Medical College.</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng States According to the New News Agency's reporter, the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, Liu Hongsheng, stated that the Wuyi steamer is not owned by the bureau, and its original agent was the Yuan'an Shipping Company. The bureau leased the steamer from Yuan'an Company, and the ship's captain was also appointed by Yuan'an. All navigation certificates were issued by the Maritime Affairs Bureau. It is unfortunate that the ship's captain, a Norwegian named Norguistott, attempted to rape a passenger. However, Ms. Li Bingyan has not yet reported to the bureau, and the details are not yet known. The bureau cannot consider any measures to be taken. Although the ship's captain was not appointed by the bureau, if Ms. Li reports to the bureau and the investigation confirms the incident, the bureau has the right to request the original ship owner, Yuan'an Company, to replace the captain.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Maritime Affairs Bureau The New News Agency reporter subsequently visited Mr. Chen Xianyan, Secretary of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and inquired about the bureau's disciplinary measures for the Norwegian captain of the Wuyi steamer, Norguistott, who attempted to rape a passenger. According to him, after the case was reported in the newspapers, the bureau paid close attention to it. However, the person involved, Ms. Li Bingyan, has not yet reported to the bureau, and the China Merchants Bureau has not submitted a report either. Therefore, the bureau has not been able to investigate the matter. Once Ms. Li Bingyan reports to the bureau, the bureau will thoroughly investigate the facts at the time and take appropriate action.</p>

<p>Words of Contribution</p>
<h3 id="e159">Announcement to Readers <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— The Editor</p>
<p>Our publication has been meeting with readers for nearly two years and has received much support, for which we are extremely grateful. However, we believe that promoting national products cannot be achieved through empty words alone, nor can it be promoted through ideals alone. The colleagues deeply feel that the articles in our publication have been too focused on empty theories and lacked practical content, too lengthy and lacking in concise and insightful points, and the words and actions have not been in accordance, and the intentions have not been relevant, which has made it difficult to satisfy the readers' wishes. In the future, the style will be slightly changed, focusing on short articles that investigate the actual situation and incisive and accurate criticisms, without relying on empty words and with supporting evidence. Each article should be lively and interesting with four to five hundred words. Lengthy articles and empty, superficial words will be omitted, and two columns will be added to increase interest.</p>
<p>1. National Products Investigation Records: The production and sales of national products in various regions, the progress of national product industries, and the people's views on national products will be described separately, with concise language. These short articles are very welcome.</p>
<p>2. Introduction of New Products from Various Factories: If there are any new products from various factories, or if there are any special points that can be used by consumers to compete with foreign products, please inform us. After our publication investigates and confirms them and reviews them as qualified, we are willing to disclose them to the people of the country.</p>
<p>In addition, photos and illustrations are also welcome.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Patriot Pan Zhishi and National Products <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— The Editor</p>
<p>Patriot Pan Hongsheng was arrested for opposing unscrupulous merchants selling imported goods, subjected to electric torture, and eventually died. On the day of Pan Zhishi's funeral, we witnessed the grand procession of various sectors escorting the funeral, stretching for miles. We believe that Pan Zhishi's willingness to die, disregarding his life, to fight unscrupulous merchants is unattainable, but his spirit is immortal. The whole city offered incense, and his honor is also unattainable. Preserving the righteous spirit of the world and reclaiming national personality, Pan Zhishi's death is of great value and adds countless protections to the future of national products. The curses against unscrupulous merchants in the funeral procession, wishing to get their due, were heard everywhere. In the future, unscrupulous merchants who sell imported goods will be intimidated, their conscience will be restored, or they will slightly reduce their activities of selling imported goods by changing their appearances. Recently, intimidated by the vigilance of the anti-traitor group and frightened by the mourning of the kneeling and crying group, they should put down the butcher knife and embark on the right path. What in the world is impossible to do? What money cannot be earned? It is unreasonable to deliberately abandon conscience and risk impropriety to sell imported goods for profit. It is our sincere hope that those who have committed this will have a moment of conscience and awaken, so that Pan Zhishi's death will not be in vain.</p>
<p>National Products Proposal</p>
<h3 id="e161">Suggesting the First Step of Industry Association <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>It is well known that industry association is a good remedy to rescue the current national products industry. However, this problem is not easy to solve. There are many conflicts of interest and personnel involvement. Different concepts and different purposes, and other kinds of facilities, are all obstacles to association. Is it because the time has not come? Then the national products industry has long been reduced to fratricide and will become a bankrupt situation. Is it because the people in it have not yet awakened? Then you can often see people running around and telling each other that they are sad that the industry is not cooperating and there is no way to do it, and sigh that it is an incurable disease. In general, everyone hopes that the industry will unite, but everyone dares not unite with the industry. To be fair, it is difficult to start a business, so it is difficult to lightly try the old one. Moreover, the four words "peer jealousy" have not only become a fixed name in the business community for hundreds of years, but also become a settled situation. The image is too bad and it is not easy to eliminate. Therefore, the problem of industry association has always become a pending case, and there is only empty talk and no way to implement it. If we prescribe the right medicine, we should first explain the points of suspicion of both parties, lead the interests according to the situation, and come gradually. Then there is the first step of the industry association suggestion.</p>
<p>1. Joint procurement: When factories purchase raw materials or consumables, it is of course cheaper to buy in bulk than to buy in retail. The same industries need the same goods. This can be combined. Even if the quantity is different, it can be apportioned according to the proportion. In the past, the same goods were different from factory A and factory B. The products this year were different from last year, and the first product was different from the second product. Why? They are all put together from all sides when purchasing raw materials, and there is no standardization. In this way, not only are raw materials cheap, or the cost is low, but if a large batch of orders are sent out, they will not be returned because they are different from the sample. By this, the competition between industries can also be avoided, and it is even more important for the future of national product sales.</p>
<p>2. Joint storage: The factory storage is originally used to store raw and cooked goods, just like the vault of the silver industry. The relationship is very important. The factory addresses of the same industries are not necessarily close to each other, and there is no need to be close to each other. The storage address must be chosen in a quiet place, with convenient water and land transportation, thorough fire protection, suitable houses, and stable management. If each factory has its own storage, the houses may not be suitable, and it is also too uneconomical. Fortunately, raw and cooked goods belong to the same category. Since there is no reason not to disclose secrets, why not gather them in one place? You can get many benefits. In case of financial difficulties, you can also get many conveniences by mortgaging to the bank. In other cases, insurance can be jointly insured, staff can be shared, and trucks and boats can be jointly purchased. This can not only promote the business association of the same industries, but also save many economic spirits for each factory.</p>
<p>3. Joint branch offices in other places: The business of branch offices in other places of each factory is mainly based on retail sales, and there is relatively little conflict of interest. If there are no industries in the local area, there is no need for competition. Since there is no competition, how can it not be combined? Since it does not matter the sales volume, it can save many expenses. If there are local industries, they should be combined. At the beginning, the strength is great, and the advantages and disadvantages are self-evident. People from the same hometown are closer in other places. What about the same industries?</p>
<p>4. Joint production: The so-called joint production is to limit production. The scarcity of goods makes them expensive, and the abundance of goods makes them cheap. In recent years, the reason why national product factories in various industries at sea are desperately depreciating prices and competing for sales, regardless of their capital, is all caused by the excess of products. The cause of the disease is where it should be treated. Please be safe and do not be impatient. Within the possible scope, limit production individually. If you can get the help of the local government and come out to control it, it is even more fair. Our national products cannot be sold to foreign countries as a dumping ground. Even if they are sold with small profits but large sales, they belong to the national economy. It only shows that they are greedy and have no pressure. Do they want to control an industry?</p>
<p>5. Joint customers: In recent years, the market situation has been deteriorating, and customers have continued to go bankrupt. Often, a small customer is bankrupted to tens of thousands of gold. In one industry, tens of thousands or eighty thousand gold are bankrupted. The reason is mostly caused by the lack of association in the industry. If a certain customer owes me three thousand gold, it seems that I can trust him. How do I know that in ten other industries in the same industry, he owes three thousand gold each? Everyone thinks that he can trust him. Once he goes bankrupt, he will regret it. If you want to inquire with each other at ordinary times, it is difficult to do it in fact before the industry is united in business. The secret is not enough, and people abandon what I take, which is even more the business method of the era of overproduction. Now, if the receivable account of the customer is due, but it has not been received, or it is deliberately delayed, or the check that has been paid is returned when it is due, then the customer is no longer a good customer, and the name of the customer and the amount owed should be notified to the industry so that everyone will pay attention.</p>
<p>6. Joint competitions: When exhibitions are held in various places, each factory in the industry should select fine products and participate together. This is enough to show the spirit of an industry and gather ideas. It will definitely win a lot of applause. At ordinary times, you can also choose a date to hold an exhibition of products from the same industry to compare the level of craftsmanship. For example, the cosmetics exhibition held by the Home Industry Society recently, Mr. Yang Yan called it the beginning of industry cooperation, which is a famous saying.</p>
<p>7. Temporary association: In recent years, those who are enthusiastic about national products have spared no effort in promoting the use of national products. National product temporary markets are held in various places without interruption. Whenever you encounter this kind of business to join, you should join together with the industry. Before joining, you should first gather people in the industry or technical experts to evaluate the goods, estimate the prices, trade fairly, and let people choose and buy. After the temporary market is over, the industry can also be held alone. Even if the products are sometimes overproduced, it is not difficult to make them demand greater than supply. In this way, one by one is united, and the industry is almost close to united business.</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e162">The Fundamental Way to Promote National Products <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>Except for a part of specialized people who are obsessed with Europeanization, and whose clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all non-foreign, they are indeed insane and unforgivable. As for the rest of the majority of compatriots who use foreign goods, I believe that although there are also a few who worship foreign goods and are willing to let the profits flow out, it is undeniable that China's industry and commerce are backward and there is no supply of corresponding substitutes!</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, weren't the tooth powders popular in our country a few years ago all Japanese goods such as Diamond and Lion Brand? At that time, especially Diamond tooth powder, almost all rural women and children knew it, from which it can be seen that its history of spreading in our country is long and common! However, in recent years, the Invincible Tooth Powder and Toothpaste of the Home Industry Society, and the Samsung Toothpaste of the China Chemical Society, have excellent quality and have come from behind, so the enemy's tooth powder has been naturally eliminated without boycott.</p>
<p>There are also condiments necessary for home cooking. In the past, only enemy goods [Ajinomoto] sold well in the market. Now, it has been taken over by the MSG of the Tianchu Factory and the Weisheng of the China Chemical Society. The Japanese goods [Ajinomoto] have almost disappeared from the market!</p>
<p>From the above two obvious examples, we can know that the people of our country do not necessarily love to use foreign goods. It is really because there are no corresponding substitutes in our country!</p>
<p>Newspaper propaganda, meetings, speeches, and other national product promotion movements, I think they are all temporary solutions. Only when the Chinese people imitate imported goods and improve national products to replace foreign goods, that is the wonderful way to cure the root cause. At this time, there will be perfect national products, and the people will not need you to publicize and persuade them to use them, and they will be happy to buy them. After all, the Chinese people's vision is narrow, and the national concept is even more very indifferent. Unless there is a supply of actual substitutes, the future of the national product movement will be difficult to get bright!</p>
<p>However, seeking substitutes for national products is not an easy task. We poor boys are incapable of it. This must be done by a general group of industrialists, and at the same time, the government should also provide special protection to national product factories, urging and encouraging them to produce and improve. Tooth powder and MSG are just like a drop in the ocean in our country's products. All other foreign goods need to be replaced by national products. Here, I sincerely hope that the general industrialists will work hard to move forward! [Tooth Powder] [MSG] are a good example for you! Work hard! There will definitely be considerable gains!</p>
<h3 id="e163">An Effective Way to Eliminate Foreign Envelopes and Stationery <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>My classmate Qin is a veteran among post office employees. Yesterday, he told me a story. Although it is inevitable that it is a little mischievous, it is very refreshing to talk about it on the basis of promoting national products.</p>
<p>Qin Jun said: [The Chinese people's superstition of using foreign goods has not diminished to this day. This can be seen in the mail we handle. I dare not lie! Among a package of mail, at least more than a hundred are pure foreign envelopes, red, red, green, and green, like the business cards of a book building; some even want to be fleshy and numb, sprinkled with some Paris perfume, which is really the best of enchantments. Therefore, I pre-engraved a wooden seal with the words: [This is a foreign envelope, users should know to be ashamed], and picked it up on foreign envelopes one by one and stamped it one by one, so that the recipient can notify the sender to change it. I think this is very effective!]</p>
<p>After listening to Qin Jun's words, I admired his enthusiasm and courage very much, so I wrote it out to warn the compatriots all over the country not to humiliate themselves again. At the same time, I have to advise our pen-holding comrades that you must not use foreign envelope paper when writing the text of the National Products Weekly in the future, otherwise, no matter how well your work is written, the editor will not be able to cut it off and throw it into the wastebasket!</p>

<p>Schools in various mountains are responsible for filling out and submitting</p>
<p>The Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education, for Northeastern youth studying in the country, previously had students fill out application forms and have them certified by the schools where they were located. Under this method, the schools would certify all application forms filled out by students in the current year. Now, the Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office has changed the application form to a recommendation form and issued the forms to various schools, based on the actual situation of Northeastern students in the school, to be filled out and registered responsibly, which is more accurate and thorough than having students fill out freely, so as not to have abuse. The recommendation form is being prepared by the office in Beiping and will be sent to all provinces and cities across the country within a few days. Generally, schools above the specialized level will fill out the forms and send them directly to the office, while elementary and middle schools will send them to the office through the education departments and bureaus of each province and city. The office will review them and send personnel to investigate and confirm that they meet the subsidy standards, and then provide subsidy funds accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e175">A Visit to the Shanghai Library School, a Militarized School <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Founded by Li Shizeng and Wu Zhihui</p>
<p>Implementing a New Education of Learning While Working</p>
<p>A Truly New Lived-in School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Library School was jointly founded by Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and others from the Chinese International Library, in cooperation with the World Book Company. The school is located on Longjiang Road, Yangshupu. As the school's system is different from ordinary schools, our reporter specially drove to visit it yesterday. The details of what was learned are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Founding Process The school is named the Library School, with the aim of cultivating practical cultural talents with balanced development of experience and knowledge through the method of mutual participation and advancement of work and academics. It implements a new education of learning while working. It was established during the summer vacation of this year. Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and others are all members of the school board. The principal is Cui Zhuxi, and the director of academic affairs is Xu Zuoyu. It is currently operating on a trial basis. The funding is subsidized by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Organizational Situation The school is divided into four departments: Library, Publishing, Printing, and Organization. The duration of study for Library and Publishing is six years, and for Printing and Organization is three years. A work-study system is adopted. Classes are held for four hours in the morning, and practical work is done in the afternoon. The Chinese International Library is the workplace for the Library Department, and the World Book Company is the workplace for the Publishing and Printing Departments. The Organization Department is dispatched at any time. Students are divided into two levels: junior high school graduates and senior high school graduates. Students are generally not charged fees. All accommodation, meals, uniforms, books, and supplies are provided by the school. Each month, a living allowance of three to six yuan is given based on the overall grades of each student's academic work, practical work, and conduct.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Facilities The school building borrows the Longjiang Building of the World Book Company, and has a library reading room, consumer cooperative, student laundry room, etc. All work in various places is done by the students themselves, so the school employs very few staff. There are only two workers in the whole school.</p>
<p>Student Life The school's student life is very different from other schools. Clothes are washed by the students themselves, and the principal and workers eat the same food. They eat together in the hall, and wash their own bowls and chopsticks. Cleaning the school's buildings is also done by the students. Every place is spotlessly clean, even more so than schools with dozens of workers. Every morning, a military instructor leads them to the riverside to conduct military training and martial arts for one hour, so the students are completely militarized and living a new life.</p>
<p>Daily Schedule Wake up at 5:30 AM, military training at 5:50 AM, morning duties at 6:45 AM, breakfast at 7:15 AM, self-study at 7:30 AM, classes for four hours from 8:30 AM to 11:45 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, recreation and reading at 12:45 PM, and cooperative sales, practical work from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, washing and bathing from 5:00 PM to 5:50 PM, dinner at 6:00 PM, recreation and reading at 7:00 PM, self-study until 8:55 PM, and bedtime at 9:10 PM.</p>

<p>Adopting the Rural Nian Er Society Method</p>
<p>Piloting People's Livelihood-Based Education</p>
<p>True Ru is relatively far from the city, completely a rural area. The population of the entire area is over 10,000, and 90% of them have not received education. In view of this, Shen Pengfei, the president of Jinan University, specially instructed the students of the Department of Education of the university to implement rural education locally. In early spring, a primary school was founded to educate general adults and children. In recent months, it has achieved considerable results. This semester, they are striving to expand it and transform it into a True Ru Township Rural Education Experimental Zone, adopting the Rural Nian Er Society method, piloting people's livelihood-based education and economic activity charts. The organization of the entire area takes the Rural Nian Er Society of each village as the center, and the village chief of each village concurrently serves as the president. Each president further forms a district affairs conference, which is guided by a guidance committee formed by the Department of Education of Jinan University. The Anjia Tu Nongquan Nian Er Society has now been established first, with a view to gradually promoting it, and Ma Jinshen, a graduate of Henan University, has been hired as the facilitator to actively prepare and carry out everything.</p>

<p>Submitted to the National Central Research Institute for Formal Study and Revision In May of this year, Mr. Wang Ruibing personally submitted the initial draft to the National Central Research Institute and met with President Cai. President Cai personally reviewed it for an hour. On June 4th of last year, he invited Shanghai literati, scholars, and education experts to a meeting in the conference room on the second floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. As a result, Cai Yuanpei suggested on the spot that the author hire several experts to revise the original manuscript. Mr. Wang then issued printed sample sheets and instructions, distributed them to scholars to solicit criticism, and has been doing so for more than a year. In March of this year, Mr. Cai asked Chen Heqin to point out the shortcomings. A refined manuscript has now been drawn. It is reported that Mr. Wang will formally submit a letter today, submitting the complete manuscript and detailed instructions to the National Central Research Institute for formal detailed study and revision.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Financial Markets: Gold Closes High, Surging Six and a Half Yuan <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Buying Sentiment Fueled… Short Covering and Turning Bullish Move in Tandem</p>
<p>Gold's overall trend remains consistently prosperous. Regardless of how the overseas markets fare, sentiment remains unperturbed. Consequently, the daily pullback yesterday was minimal, and market conditions were robust. The Central Bank's Customs Gold Unit unexpectedly increased its listing price by 0.24 points, dealing a decisive blow to sellers. Once buying activity ignited, the foreign exchange market tightened accordingly, leading to short covering and bullish reversals. The surge was significant. Initially, overseas silver markets saw the London market contract while the American market rose, leading to a slight appreciation in exchange rates. Although forward silver prices had retreated, London's spot gold declined by 5.5 pence. Off-market pre-market trading opened slightly weaker, retreating to 712 yuan. Eager buyers took advantage of the dip, promptly pushing prices upward. The morning opening reversed and opened higher.</p>
<p>After the opening, the Central Bank's listing prices were announced, with British currency contracting by 0.25 and American currency by 0.50. The gold standard price rose to over 1,000 yuan, and the Customs Gold Unit suddenly surged by 0.24 points, posing a significant threat to sellers. Morale surged, stimulating buying sentiment, and the foreign exchange market also tightened remarkably, rising to 80 yuan. Although major players were still selling at this point, banks had a strong appetite, leading to substantial fluctuations. HSBC's listing prices saw British currency contract by 0.25 and American currency by 0.50, breaking through 80 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market tightened further, with scarce supply. With major players covering short positions, sellers retreated, and buying sentiment intensified, ultimately pushing prices to over 83 yuan.</p>
<p>Thereafter, with some supply becoming available, Sassoon and others released a limited amount of currency, stabilizing the foreign exchange market and retreating it back within the 80 yuan range. The silver equalization tax remained at 8.15%. British exchange rates were calculated at 1 shilling 5.59379 pence. At this point, the market sought supply equalization, leading to more fluctuations. When the Central Bank released British currency, sentiment was slightly affected, and real users became active, causing a dip. However, the overall trend remained stable, and prices quickly recovered after the initial decline. The Central Bank's reverse hedging of near-term British gold maintained confidence, resulting in a robust situation at noon. Swap trading approached, and views within the industry varied. Before the swap trading began, the bullish sentiment was quite high, with rumors of deals already being made at 1.5 yuan. However, powerful bearish forces were reportedly preparing to liquidate their positions, making it difficult for bulls to be optimistic. When pushing up the market, the sheer volume of inventory may prevent buyers from achieving their anticipated gains.</p>
<p>Currently, with foreign silver prices rising, banks should be able to supply currency readily. However, due to the banks' soft psychology and their fear of a seller rush that could depress silver prices, many are taking a wait-and-see approach, lacking the appetite to sell. For half-day market conditions, it is easier for prices to rise than fall. The half-day market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 973.8 yuan, an increase of 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day. Although Fuxing Yong sold up to 3 yuan, the Central Bank's Customs Gold increase of 0.24 points stimulated buying sentiment, with Hengyu, Huixiang, Qingyu, Richang, Fuyu, and Dafa Yong competing to buy. The situation gradually rose to 80 yuan. Fuxing Yong offloaded its holdings, dropping to 7.5 yuan. The domestic market had tightened. Meifeng hedged December US dollars at 33.8125 yuan. Richang and Sanfeng competed to buy, pushing prices up to 9.2 yuan. Fuxing Yong, Qingyu, Dafa Yong, Xianghe, and Xiangfeng took advantage of the high prices to offload their holdings, dropping to 7.7 yuan again. Fuxing Yong, Qianchangxiang, and Dingkang negotiated, pushing prices back above 9 yuan. At this point, due to Hengchang Yong, Hengxing, Hongli, and Dalian Bang still selling, prices fell to within 8 yuan. HSBC and others hedged January US dollars at 8125 yuan. Hua Bi purchased December US dollars at 8125 yuan. Senchang Yong, Dafa Yong, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, and others continued to buy, pushing prices back to 80.5 yuan. The market anticipated HSBC's listing prices, with British currency contracting by 0.25 and American currency declining by 0.50. Fuxing Yong's selling interest remained strong, retreating to 79 yuan. However, the domestic market was extremely tight, and Chinese merchants were eager to hedge but found it difficult. Shortly thereafter, Hua Bi hedged December US dollars again at 75 yuan. With Senchang Yong, Hengyu, Fuchang, Hengxing, Tongchun, and others competing to buy, prices soared to 83.7 yuan. Hongxing, Yuanchun, Dalian Bang, Hengyu, Richang, and others eagerly sold their holdings. January US dollars at 75 yuan became difficult to sell and fell to within 79 yuan. The Central Bank's equalization tax was announced, remaining at 8.25%. At this point, Hengyu Tianfeng, Yuanmaoyong, Dingkang, and others showed considerable buying interest, repeatedly pushing prices up. The market briefly broke through 80.5 yuan twice. Shortly thereafter, the Central Bank sold February shillings at 25 to Hua Bi. Dalian Bang, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Tianfeng, Fuxing Yong, Tianfeng Yong, and others sold their positions, causing prices to fall to 76 yuan. Yifeng Yong, Zhentai, Fuxing Yong, Hengyu, Shunli, and others covered short positions, rebounding to 9.3 yuan. Tianfeng Yong and Fuyu continued to sell, retreating to 8.2 yuan. However, due to the Central Bank's reverse hedging of December shillings at 25, sentiment remained stable. Fuxing Yong, Hengyu, Richang, Yuanchang Yong, and Ruixing bought positions, pushing prices to 80 yuan. Thereafter, although buying interest was strong, prices retreated to 78.9 yuan due to Dingchang and Yicheng supplying currency. After struggling, the market closed at noon at 979.5 yuan. After the closing, sellers were slightly eager, causing prices to retreat to within 9 yuan. The highest price during the half-day was 983.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 973 yuan, with fluctuations totaling 10.07 yuan. As a result, the market closed 6.5 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's gold standard price, unexpectedly rose to over 1001 yuan, which, according to the selling price, was approximately 22 yuan weaker, exceeding the previous closing by a strong 5 yuan. The November old standard, due to HSBC's US exchange rate being reduced to 33.375 yuan, amounted to a gold standard price of over 1036 yuan. The registration price for this month was 980 yuan, and for December it was 980 yuan. The morning water supplement was 980 yuan. The cost of fine gold was calculated at 982.3 yuan. Market activity remained lackluster. Tianjin goods were still priced at an additional 9.5 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Only East goods were slightly adjusted by the spot goods dealer. Today, another 35 cash deliveries took place. Only 35 notes remained for this month, which were extremely scattered. The long positions were primarily held by Fang Yuanyi, Tianfeng, Daxing Yong, and Dadecheng, while the short positions were held by Yingji Heng and Tongyi.</p>
<p>In market trading, buying sentiment continued to intensify. Overall, Senchang Yong, Tongtaichang, Dachangxiang, Hengyu, Dingkang, Dingchang, Yongli, Shenkang, Qianchangxiang, Richang, Yuanchang Yong, and others held long positions. Dafa Yong, Fuxing Yong, Tongchun, Fuyu, Yicheng, Hongkang Yong, Xinchang, Hengchang Yong, Yuanchun, Fuan, Yongde, Yuanmaoyong, Tianfeng, Tianfeng Yong, Hongxing, and others held short positions. Shunmao, Renfa Yong, Dingchang, and Yifeng Yong first bought and then sold. Dadecheng and Fuxing Yong first sold and then bought. Dalian Bang and Shunmao collectively conducted over 1,200 trades, canceling out over 200 trades. Wanxing collectively conducted over 1,100 trades, canceling out about 100 trades. Guangdong Bang Shen Da and Hengxing's trades were not significant. The total number of transactions for the day was 49,595 trades.</p>
<p>For public notes, 35 notes were released by Yingfeng Heng today, and Yuan Yi (4 notes), Qianchangxiang (7 notes), Yifeng Yong (7 notes), and Fuyu (7 notes) each collected notes. The closing price was 980 yuan.</p>
<p>The lineup for the December period includes the following longs: Dachangxiang with over 2,700 trades, Zhengchang with over 2,500 trades, Wanxing with over 2,000 trades, Fuchang with over 1,400 trades, Changshengyong with over 1,100 trades, Senchangyong with over 1,000 trades, Yuxinxiang with over 900 trades, Shunmao with over 800 trades, Runchangyu, Yicheng, and Dadecheng with over 700 trades each, Futaiheng, Yuandayong, and Dingmai with over 600 trades each, Yuanyi, Hengyu, and Jinjiang with over 500 trades each, Yongli and Yingxiang with over 400 trades each, Yuyu, Chunyuanyong, Ruikang, Yisheng, Yongheng, Hengxing, Daxing Yong, and Wuchangxiang with over 300 trades each.

<h3 id="e191">Demand Exceeds Supply: Foreign Exchange Market Tightens Both Officially and Unofficially <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign news reports yesterday, London's major trading saw both near and far contracts contract by 0.375. The US dollar to British pound rate remained unchanged, while the British pound to French franc rate increased by 3 pounds. The US dollar to French franc rate remained unchanged. Mont de Halle's forward silver market retreated by 0.06 points. Reports indicated that the US Treasury Department announced that domestic funds could be freely transferred out of the country. This was perceived as a guarantee of sound currency and an indication that the inflationary sell-off would not recur. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4.375 pence for the British pound and 34 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound had loosened by 0.0625 and the US dollar had tightened by 0.0625. After the opening, with the Central Bank's listing prices showing a contraction of 0.25 for British currency and 0.50 for American currency, and the Customs Gold increase of 0.24 points, Chinese merchants' sentiment remained firm. Banks, in turn, began to hedge, leading to a tightening market. HSBC's listing prices were announced, showing a contraction of 0.25 for British currency and 0.50 for American currency. Banks had an appetite to buy, but Chinese merchants found it difficult to hedge, leading to a further tightening market. However, Sassoon and others took advantage of the high prices to supply currency, leading to a stabilization. Thereafter, sellers appeared eager, and the Central Bank's equalization tax remained unchanged. At this point, the market showed slight hesitation, with banks simply trading among themselves. Subsequently, the Central Bank also released currency, causing a temporary loosening. Ultimately, due to limited inventory and the Central Bank's reverse hedging of near-term contracts, the market returned to a stable state at noon. The near-term selling prices at noon were 1 shilling 4.25 pence for the British pound and 33.875 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound had tightened by 0.0625 and the US dollar had tightened by 0.1875. Although Chinese merchants had an appetite to buy, they found it difficult to obtain currency. Banks' hedging and releasing of currency remained uncertain. Zhongtong bought near contracts and released far contracts. The half-day transactions are recorded below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar market conditions generally remained unchanged. The overnight interest rate remained at 1.2%, but the call loan rate, due to banks settling accounts, temporarily faced insufficient funds for distribution, causing a surge of 0.8 points, reaching 1.3%. This was a temporary and accidental occurrence, and did not reflect any changes in the market.

<h3 id="e194">Securities and Bond Markets Only See Swap Trading <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was closed, and market conditions became increasingly sluggish, primarily due to swap trading. Trading became even more reduced. Although bearish sentiment among short sellers was strong, there were no opportunities to capitalize on. Although bullish sentiment among retail investors was firm, they lacked the ability to raise prices further. Swap trading was also opportunistic and lacked any concrete plans, so both bulls and bears wanted to swap prices. Bulls did not raise prices, and bears did not suppress prices. The market was calm and uneventful, with no glory or shame to speak of. It is speculated that the future will likely see a high followed by a low. Yesterday's market saw a slight firmness at the morning opening, with a slight improvement of about 0.1-0.2 yuan. The second round saw a reduction in troops and a return to an improvement of over 0.3 yuan. The rest largely saw a return to a slight decrease of 0.1-0.2 yuan, entirely dependent on the different swap trading of bulls and bears, resulting in minor differences. The afternoon opening saw even greater confusion, with prices varying inconsistently, and the differences were only about 0.1 yuan. The market closed with a slight decrease of 0.1-0.2 yuan. The sluggish market conditions indicated that there were no opportunities for speculators to take advantage of, and most were watching from the sidelines. Overall, the market prices showed mixed gains and losses, with amounts ranging from 0.05 yuan to 0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 12-13 million yuan. A comparative list of the resulting gains and losses is provided below (unit: 角).</p>
<h3 id="e195">New York Public Utility Stocks Are Weakest <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>New Fengyang Bank reported that yesterday (the 13th), the New York stock market was shaken due to the weakness of public utility stocks. There was a general fear that the government would reduce public utility charges. As the New York authorities proposed that New York's electricity charges be reduced by 40%, public panic intensified. Automobile stocks were affected by the publication of the reorganization details of the Studebaker Corporation. Some speculators believed that the value of common stock would be almost completely eliminated after the company's reorganization, so they sold off the stock. Construction, kerosene, and railway stocks remained flat, while silver stocks also rose due to high silver prices. The rise in silver prices was attributed to strong overseas market conditions and rumors that the United States was significantly increasing its imports in London. According to reports, the purchase of difficulty laws failed to be fully implemented, leading to a decrease in supply. Blue-collar silver is waiting for the continued development of the situation and hoping to sell at a high price. The bond market was stable, and stocks on the small exchanges declined. Chicago wheat stabilized due to the visible reduction in spot supply. The total daily transaction volume was 1.13 million shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>
<p>Dow Jones Indices (Data from the 10th and 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Cotton Yarn: Bulls Take Profits <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, with the situation slightly softening. This was due to slightly weak sales of spot yarn and some bulls taking profits. However, the volume absorbed by major players had not been fully released, so the market remained somewhat firm. However, Japanese traders were seen selling another 3-4,000 bales.</p>
<p>Jinji (Gold Chicken) Softens</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market was affected by weak American cotton, but market sentiment remained tight. Prices for all months rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The market began to soften suddenly as bulls took profits at the 3 o'clock closing. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.2-0.3-0.4 yuan. The afternoon opening saw Japanese traders selling slightly, causing a softening. Later, bulls came in to push prices back up. As a result, near contracts fell by 0.3-0.5 yuan, and far contracts fell by 0.1 yuan. However, spot yarn trading was relatively light. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,800 bales.

<p>The cotton market was flat, and the market situation softened again. This was because most people had predicted a rise in American cotton prices the previous day. However, a telegram indicated a slight drop of 2-3 pounds, disappointing the bulls. Floating investors sold their positions, causing the market to turn downward. At the same time, spot cotton business became increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>Currency Retrieval Falls 0.25 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening of the standard cotton market was affected by a prediction of rising American cotton prices from the previous day. However, a telegram indicated a drop of 2-3 pounds, disappointing the bulls and causing fatigue. Furthermore, there was profit-taking from bullish positions. Prices for all months fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The afternoon remained flat, with far-month contracts rebounding and profit-taking occurring. Prices for all months fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan in the afternoon, and the far months rebounded by 0.05 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 61,400 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was mixed and uncertain. Prices initially rose due to foreign merchants buying, but then declined due to rain in drought areas. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices fell by 1-3 pounds. English cotton futures fell by 3 points. Indian cotton weakened due to selling by speculators and European exporters. Pingguo just fell 7 and a half, while Aomula and Bairuo Creek fell 1 rupee. The original telegram records are on the left (telegram from the 13th).</p>

<p>After the morning opening, the flour market showed a consistent stability across all months. Imported wheat quotes were slightly improved, with Chicago up 0.04 to 0.16 yuan and Canada up 0.20 yuan. While trading was not robust during the opening, sentiment within and outside the industry turned firmer due to the rising price of rice. Fewer sellers and tighter buyers resulted in a positive market atmosphere. As a result, opening prices were also firm, and the market was unusually buoyant. By the afternoon opening, transactions became smoother, and the market showed fluctuation. As the flour market changed little compared to the morning, sentiment stabilized somewhat. However, there were few sellers in the market, and the atmosphere remained firm. As a result, the current month improved by 0.05 yuan, December improved by 0.03 yuan, January improved by 0.02 yuan, and February improved by 0.06 yuan. The spot wheat market saw no transactions again for the whole day, as factory customers competed with each other.</p>
<p>After the morning opening, the wheat market consistently showed stability across all months. Imported wheat quotes were slightly improved, with Chicago up 0.04 to 0.16 yuan and Canada up 0.20 yuan. The slight improvement in imported wheat and the difficulty in procuring spot wheat from factories caused many to adopt a wait-and-see approach during the opening. As a result, the release of goods was not smooth, and sentiment outside the industry seemed to favor the flour market due to the gradually increasing price of rice. Therefore, fewer sellers and more buyers caused the market to turn positive. By the afternoon opening, the current month saw some factory firms replenishing their positions, maintaining stable sentiment. Distant months also saw a slight firmness due to still-good sentiment outside the industry. The future situation depends on the actual sales and the rise and fall of foreign exchange rates. As a result, the current month improved by 0.015 yuan compared to the previous day, December improved by 0.0125 yuan, January improved by 0.02 yuan, February improved by 0.0115 yuan, March improved by 0.015 yuan, and April improved by 0.0075 yuan.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were approximately 30 sources of supply from various regions, with nearly 5,000 石 of goods. The initial market seemed ordinary, but later customers arrived in droves and made purchases in succession. Sellers' shouts rose, and the market tightened, gradually rising. Dunliao's warehouses remained idle, and only one ship was processed in Qingdao, numbering only a hundred or so bags. As a result, it was still difficult for the market to improve significantly, and prices only increased by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Prices for late rice such as Qingjiao, Songsi, Fengli, and 綀 and for early Japonica rice from Changbang, Sutong, and Nangang increased by over 0.1 yuan. Duyang pointed rice has been occupying a particularly fresh position in recent days compared to Japonica rice, with only a slight hint of color. Yin Yuan's liquor customers were very active, and the price rose by more than 0.3 feet.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over 20 river cargo ships arrived. The market was very active for goods such as new Japonica rice, thin rice, new Yang Du pointed rice, new Chen Buke pointed early rice, etc. There were few Chen Bai Yuan rice left in storage, and warehouse stocks were also low. New goods had been scarce since arriving at the port on the 13th. Liquor customers continued to be active, and retail sales were also brisk. Yin Yuan rice was also good. Prices for new Japonica rice, broken Japonica rice, new Yang pointed rice, new Chen Buke pointed rice, etc., were stable, and Chen Bai Yuan rice suddenly rose by 0.4-0.5 yuan. Yin Jiu also increased by 0.1-0.2 yuan, and thin rice increased by about 0.2 yuan. New Du pointed rice increased by about 0.1 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was active, with strong buying and selling both locally and inland. More than two shipments of imported rice were stored in the market, but as sales were active, the market gradually improved. Local trading of rice futures was very robust, but the release of rice by foreign merchants caused the market to rise and then flatten. March Saigon opened initially at 5.275 yuan and then returned to 5.25 yuan. April opened initially at 5.32 yuan, but the market only saw 5.3 yuan thereafter. In April, a new transaction was made for 1,000 tons from Heyang, and Dasheng Jinlong, etc., accounted for 1,200 tons. In March, Tongji and Xin Kai both accounted for a total of 1,700 tons, which was all collected by the local market. Siam also opened 400 tons in March at a price of 5.43 yuan. Most of the spot imported rice was handled by the local market, while the Indica rice was digested inland. The current number of imported rice is 4,000 bags from Saigon, 2,000 bags each of Siamese and Annam rice. The current price for passenger Indica rice from Xianghan and Shashi totaled 8,662 bags, with prices rising by 0.05-0.06 yuan to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

The guild quoted 18 yuan 55 cents for spot raw sugar of ordinary quality, 18 yuan 65 cents for goods from this company, and a premium of 10 cents for transshipment goods. No transactions were made for No. 8 or 9 Dutch red sugar, with ordinary spot goods quoted at 14 yuan and transshipment goods at a premium of 10 cents, at 4 yuan 90 cents. Taikoo Sugar B mark was priced at 19 yuan 70 cents, and this factory's refined white Zhenyu No. 1 was at 16 yuan 60 cents. The original Hong Kong ice slab sugar, excluding packaging, opened at 14 yuan 60 cents, down 40 cents from before. Over 100 bags of oil-wrapped Longgang slab sugar were priced at 11 yuan 20 cents, unchanged. The first batch of new slab sugar, consisting of 45 cases transported from Hubei, has arrived and samples will be available for price quotation today.</p>

<p>Longkou vermicelli has been out of stock for a long time. It is now learned that the first batch of new goods was shipped by the Yuxing vessel the day before yesterday. Yesterday, 7,000 to 8,000 packages were offered, priced at 21 yuan. However, the market has not moved due to unsold inventory. The local price is 26 yuan 50 cents per package, and it is not expected to loosen for a while, as the Guangdong merchants have already directly purchased 7,000 pieces locally.</p>

The entire city agreed to 600 or so boxes, with the market price opening at 23 yuan, a decrease of 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous week. It is said that the firm plans to continue searching for supplies. Tongfu, Shaixin, Xiehe, and Yihang and other firms are all interested in Zhenmei, Zhenzhou, and other teas, and transactions are quite active, but the selling prices have also decreased by 1 to 2 yuan to 4 to 5 yuan compared to before.</p>

<p>Li Shilian smiled and said, "I dare not be conceited about other things, but when it comes to newly established institutions, how to organize them, I am always a bit of an expert." Jia Duocai laughed, "Just go find a way, and once you find a way, we'll have a place to do business, no matter what." "You two talk, I'll see you in the evening." As he spoke, he stood up. Li Shilian saw him come in a hurry, and he must have something to say. Now that he left without saying anything, it seemed that he did not want to say it because there was someone there. So he followed him behind, to the gate of the courtyard, and asked in a low voice, "Duocai, do you have any advice?" Jia Duocai couldn't help laughing and said, "There's nothing to say. I heard that the girl is in the back courtyard, so I came to take a look." Li Shilian laughed and said, "You really haven't forgotten her. If you really mean it, I can help you with it." Jia Duocai laughed and said, "Just acting on the stage, don't take it seriously." With that, he quickly walked away. Li Shilian returned to the room, and Guo Dunpin's first words were, "Does this person have money or not?" Shilian said, "To say he has money in his own hands, I wouldn't say he has much, but he is very active. To move twenty or thirty thousand yuan is no big deal." Guo Dunpin straightened the thumb and little finger of his right hand, compared them on his lips, and asked, "Does he like this?" Then he stretched out both hands, pressed his palms flat, a few inches away from the table, and rubbed them back and forth several times, and said, "Or does he like this?" Li Shilian said, "He doesn't like either of these, he likes women." Guo Dunpin laughed and said, "This thing, I can do it, I'll find two people for him to look at, okay?" Shilian then told him about the refugee girl he had noticed. Guo Dunpin said, "Alas! People from the west road, can they still be saved? If you ask people to come to Little Western Paradise, whether it works out or not, you have to spend a dollar or two on transportation first. I'll just pretend that a friend brought them here, without spending a penny, and let him take a look." (64)</p>
<h3 id="e206">The West Lake Pleasure Boats of the Yuan Dynasty <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Mentioning the [West Lake Pleasure Boats], one cannot help but be transported to the Six Bridges and Three Temples. Since the Song Dynasty, West Lake has been praised by people; therefore, it is natural to associate it with pleasure boats. Thus, when ancient people described West Lake, they always depicted it—the pleasure boat—in their writings; there are many such examples, too numerous to record.</p>
<p>Now, everyone knows that there are two types of West Lake pleasure boats: large and small. The smaller ones are simply rowing boats, with sharp ends and covered with cloth awnings. In the middle, they are bordered by copper or rattan railings, and inside there are rattan tables and chairs, simply arranged. The larger ones are shaped like Suzhou speedboats, with windows on the sides, resplendent with gold and jade; they can accommodate many people. This is the style of pleasure boats in recent times. As for what the pleasure boats of ancient times looked like, little is recorded, so much cannot be verified.</p>
<p>I recently read the Zhenju lyrics by Zhang Boyu of the Yuan Dynasty, which contains a poem [Too often lead], which can be used to examine the style of the pleasure boats at that time. It is entitled:</p>
<p>[Man Weng newly made pleasure boats in the lake, I named his boat Floating Home. Weng's surname is Li, named Renzhong, and the use of cloth sails on lake boats began with Li.] The full poem is recorded below:</p>
<p>[Do not compare West Lake to Xizi, a thousand years of Tao Zhu; fearing to live in buildings, also using wind sails and short cattails. Silver bottle asks for wine, and the knife chops the seabass, the boat's back is blurred with brocade. On the embankment, early preaching: [Who is the fisherman of the misty waves?]]</p>
<p>[The use of cloth sails on lake boats began with Li.] From this, we can see that before the Yuan Dynasty, West Lake pleasure boats did not use sails, and we can also prove that [since Li began], there must have been many boats using sails on the lake. The [Floating Home] indicates the size of the boat. The [asking for wine] and [chopping seabass] suggest that the boat could set up banquets, gather guests and drink heartily. From the sentence [the boat's back is blurred with brocade], we can imagine that the boats at that time must have had windows on the sides, and the furnishings inside the boat must have been very rich. The [preaching] shows that the crowd of tourists on the embankment is self-evident.</p>
<p>I therefore think that if the current West Lake pleasure boats could use cloth sails, then the sails would make the lake more secluded and beautiful. However, if the boatmen want to worship their ancestors, then naturally they should promote the old man Li of the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="e207">A Record of Court Hearing <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Going to court to listen to a trial, this is the first time in my life.</p>
<p>It was a late autumn morning, in order to increase my knowledge, I took a car with my colleague Mr. Zhang to the Special Zone Court to be a spectator.</p>
<p>After getting spectator tickets, I sat in the second courtroom, waiting for the trial to begin. Before the trial, I looked around at all kinds of spectators. Some looked worried, as if they had endless things on their minds. Some were talking eloquently, discussing how to deal with the judge's questions. Here, everything seemed silent, revealing the dignity of the court.</p>
<p>The trial began, and everyone bowed to the judge and sat down to listen! I sat for two hours, and I felt that the people being tried were all compatriots from your country with hungry faces, yellow skin and thin bones. And the cases being tried were almost all thefts and other similar situations. This really gave my heart a great stimulus.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to listen any longer, so I came out with Mr. Zhang. On the way home, I silently thought in my heart: [How should society help these poor compatriots? Passive sanctions ultimately feel unhelpful, and I hope the social authorities will consider this!]</p>
<h3 id="e208">Problems in Child Rearing <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country. Their growth, from breastfeeding to leaving the swaddling clothes, receiving education, and reaching various stages of being of service to society and seeking the welfare of the country, completely requires the nurturing and guidance of their fathers, mothers, teachers, good friends.</p>
<p>But how to raise children? Is grammar dependent on means? These are all extremely important small problems.</p>
<p>For example: How do fathers and mothers raise their children? By being overly indulgent? That result is equivalent to killing the child's soul. By strict control? Children have various personalities with innocence, liveliness, and stubbornness. Will they willingly accept instruction? So, how can it be transformed from ugliness, violence, to goodness?</p>
<p>Clear revelation is extremely necessary. If the child goes the wrong way, you have to pull him back and tell him to walk again. What must be walked is the bright avenue. Deception is inappropriate, and indulgence is even more unacceptable. When punishment is due, he should be given a serious lesson. Mama Huhuhu indulges in love and is no different than containing heavy venom that can bury the lives of children.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the [Woman's Guidance] film that is being shown in Xinguang has won the praise of the Children's Welfare Association, and it has a very thorough exposure of the problems of children's education. I hope all parents in the world will go and see it.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Yinjuan <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<h3 id="e210">Walk on the Left <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Junren</p>
<p>I don't know about foreign countries, so I dare not say much about the traffic on the roads. In China, most of them walk on the left, not on the right. Qingdao is the only place that walks on the right.</p>
<p>No one can answer why the traffic on the roads in Qingdao must walk on the right. It is said that it was already like this before the takeover. Before the takeover, it was managed by the Japanese, and it was like this during the Japanese management. Before the Japanese, it was managed by the Germans, and it was walking on the right during the German management. So this method has been followed for a long time.</p>
<p>But now the Qingdao Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued a notice that all vehicles, horses, and pedestrians in the city must switch to walking on the left from October 1st of this year. Pedestrians who do not follow this method deserve to die, and vehicles that do not follow this method will be punished.</p>
<p>Chinese people have always had a distinction between high and low for the left and right sides. When people are invited to dinner, they must let the guests sit on the left. In old-fashioned weddings, when the bride and groom bow to each other, the man also stands on the left. Since this is the case, when walking on the road, one naturally has to walk from the left side, and walking from the left side has a meaning of going upward.</p>
<p>The Qingdao Municipal Public Security Bureau has broken decades of habit. Changing from walking on the right to walking on the left is probably also this mentality.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Tidbits <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

<p>Bao Gege, the male protagonist of The Story of the Stone, said: A man is made of mud, and a woman is made of water, which means that a man is turbid and a woman is pure; however, if the tide is turbulent and the water splashes, it will stir up the mud at the bottom of the water, and overturn the mud on the shore. Wouldn't it be mixing with the mud?</p>
<h3 id="e212">Imperial Fragrance Drifting Record <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In that small court on the train, the Empress Dowager's throne was specially made: but in the palaces of Shengjing, there were several existing ones prepared, and there was no need to make another one. Although their carvings and decorations are far less exquisite and rich than those in the Beijing palace because of their age and infrequent use, the one that is now placed in the side hall is not so old. Its material is also generally made of red sandalwood, and there is also a red sandalwood screen behind it, inlaid with very precious marble.</p>
<p>On the walls on all sides, there are also paintings of [Great Fortune] patterns, just like on the walls of the train carriage. The authors of these murals are of course those skilled lacquer workers. They like to use very bright colors for the characters or flowers they paint, which inevitably makes them feel too vulgar.</p>
<p>Taking this main hall as an example, or representing all the palaces in Shengjing with this main hall, they are indeed very brilliant: however, if compared with the imperial villa in Rehe, they are inferior in every aspect! I might as well list a few points as an explanation. For example, on the walls, there are only many murals painted here, which are certainly very bright, but how can they be said to be precious and unique? In the imperial villa in Rehe, there are several halls that the Holy Driver often visits, and the walls are covered with various tribute satins: these tribute satins generally also have very beautiful patterns woven on them. Their value is at least ten or twenty times higher than that of paint. Also, in the imperial villa in Rehe, there are many lifelike flying dragons coiled around all the courtyard frames, which are thick enough to be embraced, in several main halls where the Empress Dowager stays each time: they are neither made of wood nor carved from mud, but are originally cast entirely of gold.

<p>Whereabouts</p>
<h3 id="e213">Late Autumn at Ban Yuan <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Kunshan is not very profound in my imagination. That day, after I and Shoujuan and Xiaoqing watched the chrysanthemums in Qingyang Port, we arrived in Kunshan and found it more ordinary than Tiger Hill in Suzhou. But taking advantage of the fact that the setting sun had not yet fallen below the horizon and the evening colors could still allow us to remember the scenery, we hurriedly went to Ban Yuan for a while, which still makes me feel a little reluctant to this day.</p>
<p>Ban Yuan was called Yuan in the Ming Dynasty, and it was owned by the Ye family, with an area of sixty mu. In the early Qing Dynasty, it was divided into three, and one-third belonged to the Zhong family, so it was called Ban Yuan. But now I estimate that it is not even twenty mu. Because of the good planning of the Sorting Association, it is not considered small. Three open pavilions can be used for tea tasting and social gatherings. There is wireless radio broadcasting, which comes out leisurely from the wall. On the opposite hill, there is a towering Linglong Taihu stone, which is indeed shorter than the Guanyun Peak in Liuyuan Garden in Suzhou, but it also has a long history. It was originally an old object in front of Wang Zhongyu's Kuaizaiting Pavilion in Yangzhou in the Song Dynasty, with an inscription by Su Dongpo. Gu Dehui of the Yuan Dynasty got it from the Xinan Ni Temple in Tongtu Bridge. In the eighth year of the Qing Dynasty, Fang Xian moved it to the garden. This stone is called [Han Cui], and it is inscribed very beautifully, almost as if it were a young girl.</p>
<p>Speaking of young girls, I saw a poem by Gu Tianxi on the wall:</p>
<p>[The wind horse chases the cloud banner, the matter of the gods is even more doubtful, the clear jade earrings reflect the emerald feathers, the fog valley reflects the jade posture; the appearance of Luopu's startled swan, the words that Chen Wang engraved in his heart, diligently laboring in dreams, entrusting the vague thoughts.]</p>
<p>His postscript said that there used to be a statue of the flower god in this garden, with a very beautiful face, but now it is gone, so he is very deeply thoughtful. When I arrived here and read this, I also felt something like that, and wrote a poem to translate for him:</p>
<p>[To see the jagged Han Cui Stone, the setting sun and Autumn England are half new, just have Wu songs coming to the horizon, no need to entrust thoughts to the flower god.]</p>
<p>In the east, there is a crenellated wall, which is short but cleverly reliable for looking into the distance. Who knows that looking into the distance is not as good as looking closely? There is a clear stream outside the wall, and on the opposite bank there is a fisherman sitting peacefully there, lifting a fish trap. Behind him, there are uneven wild trees, and half a field mixed with yellow and green, and in the distance there is a bright sunset, forming a living picture. Unfortunately, the night ruthlessly drove us out of the garden, not allowing us to get any more fun. But it can also be said that it is precisely because of the hurried coming and going that I can still feel a little reluctant to this day.</p>
<p>There are many gardens in Suzhou, and I have been to almost all of them that have a little reputation, but none of them are as petite and exquisite as Ban Yuan, especially with the natural setting and rendering. We feel that this kind of small garden is most suitable for the layout of small cities. At the same time, we also feel that many gardens in Suzhou still need to be reorganized. Like the Ban Yuan Sorting Association, it collects fragments of ancient objects in the city and puts them in the garden, and some of them are used as seats. In this way, every piece of wood and every stone has been given its proper place. I also feel that this can give those who preserve ancient objects and those who engage in construction a reference.</p>

<h3 id="e214">What We Need in Translations <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Lie</p>
<p>Translation is indeed popular this year. First, [Literature] consecutively published two special issues on translation, followed by the emergence of [Translation] and [World Literature], and [Modern] also published a special issue on American literature to join in the fun. Translation, which has always been regarded as a matchmaker and not paid much attention to, actually has a chance to stand out, which is really a gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, what is slightly unsatisfactory is that most of the translated articles are short stories, and there is not a single one with a longer length. Moreover, some of these short stories are very familiar, as if I have seen them somewhere before. When I open old magazines to check, I can often find them. Of course, we are not against translating a work again and again, because we can often compare the merits of the translation from two different translations, but if we find too many, we can't help but feel that the waste of ability is a pity.</p>
<p>There are material reasons for the recent translation world's abundance of short stories and lack of long stories. We cannot complain about the translators. Because translators are also people, and they need material things to maintain their lives. In this year of sluggish publishing and lonely single-volume books, translating long translations is time-consuming, and it is not easy to find a way out after the translation is completed. As the saying goes, [Performing tricks with a stone mortar on your head is a lot of work and no reward]. In order to solve the material life, translators of course only have the one way of translating short stories.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the creative cultivation of young people, long translations are very necessary. Recently, there has been a problem in the literary world of why there are no great works produced, and observing the works of general young writers, most of them inevitably have the disadvantages of being superficial and empty. Often, they have very good themes and materials, but because they do not have the skills to describe them, they inevitably fail. If the works of foreign masters can be translated as much as possible, so that they can observe and learn from them, and understand how to layout and describe them in order to move people, I believe that in our barren literary circle, there will definitely be a few wonderful flowers.</p>
<p>So, what kind of translations do we need now?</p>
<p>Forgive me for saying boldly: we need a lot. Whether it is ancient or modern, as long as it is listed in the forest of world literature masterpieces and deserves it without shame and we have no translation, we need it.</p>
<p>Regarding the ancient ones, Homer's two epics, [Odyssey], already have a translation by Mr. Fu Donghua, but [Iliad] has not yet appeared, we need [Iliad]. In addition, the works of the three great Greek tragic writers, although most of them have been lost, there are still many that have been passed down to the world, and we all hope to have a chance to read them. Also, the Roman poet Virgil's [Aeneid], which was previously translated and published in part in Fiction Monthly, we also hope to have a complete translation.</p>
<p>Regarding the Renaissance era, Cervantes' [Don Quixote] complete translation, we really need it more urgently than any other work. Because among modern young people, terms such as Rudin type, Hamlet type, Bazarov type, and Don Quixote type are very popular. The first three have already been translated, but the latter only has a classical Chinese [Demon Hero Biography], which is not enough to satisfy our readers' hopes. Also, Shakespeare's six great tragedies, except for [Hamlet] [Macbeth] [Romeo and Juliet] which have been translated, others such as [Othello] [Julius Caesar] [Antony and Cleopatra] have not been translated, I hope someone can come forward to complete this work.</p>
<p>Although the works of the 17th and 18th centuries are no longer to our taste, there are several famous works, such as Milton's [Paradise Regained], Bunyan's [The Pilgrim's Progress], Richardson's [Pamela], Fielding's [Tom Jones], Goldsmith's [The Vicar of Wakefield], etc., and we also hope that someone can translate them for us to read.</p>
<p>There are many famous works in the 19th century, and most of these famous works do not have Chinese translations. If we want to list them all, it is definitely not something that can be accommodated in a short space. Here, we can only say some roughly. In England, we need Scott's [Waverley Novels], Dickens' [A Tale of Two Cities], Hardy's [Jude the Obscure], Byron's [Don Juan], etc. In France, we need Balzac's [La Comedie Humaine], Zola's [Les Rougon-Macquart], etc. In Russia, we need Goncharov's [Oblomov], Dostoevsky's [The Brothers Karamazov], etc. In Germany, we need Goethe's [Faust] Second Alley, Hauptmann's [Einsame Menschen], etc. In the United States, we need Irving's [The Spy], Hawthorne's [The Scarlet Letter], [The Shallows], the Italian D'Annunzio's [Fire], etc., which are also what we urgently need to read.</p>
<p>As for modern masterpieces, such as Shaw's dramas, Gorky Sinclair, and the novels of the New Russian writers, although many have been introduced, long works such as Romain Rolland's [Jean-Christophe], Galsworthy's [Forsyte], etc., still need the continued efforts of translators.</p>
<p>I am not a celebrity, and I don't have the courage to open a reading list on behalf of young people. The ones listed here are just what I personally feel are more needed, although they may represent the opinions of some people.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Passing Through Linggi Lama (Part 1) <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>After emerging from the edge of Shangda city, the car sped along the forest lane. Because there were almost no pedestrians on the road except in the residential areas of villages, cities, and botanical gardens, the two drivers were eager to return to their homes, so the car was driven at the highest possible speed. Along the way, only a white sky and dark green tree shadows flashed by, and occasionally a few colorful cars passed by.</p>
<p>After boarding at Wan Tao Durian, the car continued to travel at yesterday's speed, and the scenery seen was not much different. Once one is accustomed to traveling through the lush lanes of the equator, one will have the illusion that except for the car one is in rushing madly, the world is completely still.</p>
<p>However, as the car approached Linggi Lama, the situation was a little different. The car had just passed through an American magnate's rubber plantation, and the rows of workers' residences, lying flat like pigeon coops, had just passed. The image of the Javanese workers' [sarongs] drying outside the doors, fluttering in the wind like the shadows of flags on ships, had not yet been forgotten, when the car climbed a small hill. Because the rubber trees had not been planted for long, when the car reached the top of this hill, looking out over the low bushes below, one could see a scene never before seen in the equatorial zone. Before one's eyes were low bushes stretching to the horizon, the red sun was scorching in the sky, and the village clusters were undulating, making one feel as if one were in a vast desert. The highway lay winding through this red land, like the footprints left by travelers and camel caravans in the desert.</p>
<p>As the car passed through this small market town with only a few small shops, Chinese shopkeepers and Javanese workers glanced at the car, and it lightly kissed them. A sign written in black Chinese characters on white cloth, "[XX Orchard Chinese School]," was displayed in front of a small wooden house. This made me extremely happy, as I am well aware of the difficulties in establishing overseas Chinese children's schools among workers and small merchants; and in such a small place, such a simple overseas Chinese elementary school was showing, which was truly heartening.</p>
<p>The car drove out of the vast plantation (which took more than an hour, and it is said that the dismissal of workers in this plantation later caused a small disturbance, because the workers were extremely numerous and most of them were dismissed). Soon, it arrived at Linggi Lama.</p>

<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>– Snippets of Life Studying in Japan –</p>
<p>First of all, I must first introduce our group. There are four people in our group, three of whom are a bit wild, and only one is a bit more serious. That's why we all call her "Big Sister". In fact, she is much older than us. The first person in our group is R.Y., the second is Mambo, who used to have mixed up some days in the army.</p>
<p>Sometimes, she is even wilder than B.Y. The third is "Big Sister", and the fourth is me. Because they are all women, and I am the only exception, our group is under female rule.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about our motivation for cooking ourselves. Because we live in the same boarding house and go to the same school, everyone feels that the food in the restaurants is not good and costs a lot of money. Cooking ourselves is more economical and delicious, so everyone started paying attention to cooking themselves.</p>
<p>One morning a week ago, we held a food meeting and passed the following resolutions: 1. Each person contributes nine yuan per month for expenses, which can be increased as needed. 2. The four people are divided into two groups, and each day one group is responsible for buying vegetables, washing rice, cooking, washing dishes and chopsticks, etc. 3. Lunch is at 11:00 am, and dinner is at 6:00 pm. 4. You cannot only buy the dishes you like to eat. These resolutions were implemented from the day we started cooking.</p>
<p>Now, we have been living a self-cooking life for a week. Every day we work happily and eat happily. Our friends envy our life and envy the dishes we cook, so friends often come to eat. Mambo's cooking tastes very good, she is really an expert, but she is too bad, she brags, she says she used to cook for nine months in Changsha, she can cook very good dishes, but the fact tells us that the dishes she cooks are the worst, often cooking the beef like a piece of cloth, I laugh at her, I say: "You can only write novels, you are a beginner at cooking, you should do a three-year apprenticeship." But she denies it, she either says the fire is too big today, or she says she forgot to put soy sauce today.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening it was Mambo's turn to cook again, and Wang Ying happened to come to our place. We asked her to stay for dinner, and she said: "Okay!" So we bought some more vegetables and some noodles. The dishes last night were really well cooked, which everyone agreed on. During the meal, Wang Ying said: "I eat that Japanese food that doesn't suit my taste every day, it's so bitter, I feel like I'm in a foreign country every day. After eating this dish tonight, I feel like I'm back in China."</p>
<p>We also discussed that we should have a big meal during the New Year. Wang Ying suggested buying a lot of wine. I suggested buying at least two chickens, and proposed to kill a pig, which made us laugh so hard our stomachs hurt. Each of us is not very young, and we have also done a little work in society, and we have learned a set of "sophisticated" faces, however, when we are with friends, we all show a pure childlike heart, just like children.</p>
<p>I believe we will gain weight living like this, and it is also a student life without any responsibility.</p>

<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>With moist light flashing in his eyes, he suddenly stood up, unusually angry, patted his temples and yelled:</p>
<p>"Fish can still be eaten when they grow up, but people! People, they can only rot."</p>
<p>He ignored the net casters and the pedestrians on the bridge who were laughing at him mockingly, tears glistening on his withered cheeks. His name was also extended from "fragrant grass" to "liar," "conscience"... As for whether "liar" was condemning "fragrant grass" himself, or others, people never cared about this aspect.</p>
<p>He returned to the inn with the weariness of old age, and it became lively. The waiter flitted back and forth, like a puppy welcoming its master; affectionately twisting his arm. He dodged back and forth, now with an impatient expression, definitely not angry. The waiter understood, there was nothing to do now - he neither watched operas at night, nor gambled, he only drank alcohol before going to bed.</p>
<p>Regarding drinking, the waiter put it well:</p>
<p>"If you don't gamble, don't drink, what does a person do? At most, it's just a hundred years, lying under the coffin boards in all four seasons, enduring and enduring, a good death is like blowing away ashes!" But looking at "Fragrant Grass'" gradually purpling face, he would immediately switch his tone, saying sadly: "Old friend, you should turn back! In youth, life is like a thread in the sky. You fear nothing on earth. But when you're old, you should take some precautions."</p>
<p>The waiter remembered these words clearly. He had been a bartender in this inn for more than ten years, and had never said them to a single passerby. Only "Fragrant Grass" was the exception.</p>
<p>"Fragrant Grass" also understood the weight of these words between people, but he could not take the sincere advice as a lullaby. Once, the waiter had a falling out with him and didn't bring him wine. For an entire night, he seemed to be seriously ill, moaning like an opium addict in pain, tears streaming down. In fact, that suffering was beyond imagination. A person, just a single person, after endless humiliations from birth. These humiliations accumulate over the days and months until the age of fifty or sixty, and they have an unbearable weight. Turn back. The terrifying past is like crisscrossing harbors, like a sea of churning black waves. How can he cross that boundless night covered in black fur? Except by drinking wine. Otherwise, it's better to die.</p>
<p>"Without drinking wine, the sins are deeper than the sea!"</p>
<p>There is such a famous saying. If the depth of sins is measured by the amount of suffering endured, these words are correct. He believed it to be the truth.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and tapped the table with his chopsticks, making an unpleasant, greasy sound. This was a ditty that could be heard everywhere on the quietly blue-green Huai River, a melody mixed with joy and sorrow. At first, it was very rhythmic, but as time went on, it was just like those ditties themselves, all mixed up.</p>

<h3 id="e219">On "Boasting" and "Mutual Disdain" <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Ran</p>
<p>Modern literati have accepted the legacy of previous generations of literati, but they have also accepted many of the characteristics of previous generations of literati at the same time.</p>
<p>Previous generations of literati had many characteristics, and among the most commonly existing characteristics among previous generations of literati, and which have been further evolved after being accepted by modern literati, is probably "boasting" and "mutual disdain."</p>
<p>Why do literati boast and disdain each other? We can summarize several reasons from articles of the argumentative type: the reason for "boasting" is due to "moral character and literary talent, both admired," "the like-mindedness of worthy people;" the reason for "mutual disdain" is due to "lack of knowledge and skill," "unwillingness to associate with the depraved." In fact, these are all superficial words, and at heart it is not necessarily the case. Ultimately, it is nothing more than the worship of "self," the superior ones inevitably "blindly feel the elephant," stubbornly adhering to their own opinions; the inferior ones are completely enthusiastic about the pursuit of "fame."</p>
<p>Originally, very few literati in ancient China married books to real life. It is difficult to find the position of books of the type of "governance and statecraft writings" in the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, so literati have become some bookworms full of square-hat air. As long as they privately study a few ancient people or a few classics, they "carve a mark on a boat to find a sword," stubbornly guarding a corner. If you feel an elephant's leg, you will speak eloquently; if I feel an elephant's trunk, I will go against you with flags and drums. Due to the arrogance of the square-hat air, they will pull together their own kind and "boast" to make a big scene. "Abusive words are never good," and "mutual disdain" is inevitable. This is still the superior ones.</p>
<p>The most intolerable and most common characteristic of literati is the enthusiasm for the pursuit of "fame."</p>
<p>Originally, "fame and fortune" have been the symbols of life in China since ancient times. Perhaps because the word "fortune" is too vulgar, ancient literati have been particularly enthusiastic about "fame." Like the so-called "climbing the dragon" nowadays, the first thing is always to obtain "fame." Only after having "fame" can it be used as a stepping stone for all attempts, so "fame" has become the first meaning for literati.</p>
<p>Because "self's" "fame" is the goal, in addition to showing "goods," they have to use some means. "Boasting" and "mutual disdain" are the "only way." "Boasting" can form a fortress by itself, joining hands to "climb the dragon," which is considered successful, the essence of the "mutual aid doctrine." "Mutual disdain" is like "enemies meeting, especially red-eyed," a melee of thirty rounds is necessary to see who is superior. This may be Darwin's "theory of evolution."</p>
<p>Therefore, "literati have no morals" has become a common evaluation by the general public.</p>
<p>The highest and most supreme magic weapon is still to nakedly present the "goods" to the audience. "Bystanders see clearly," and the audience will not fail to distinguish between black and white. "Boasting" and "mutual disdain" do not seem to be the right paths.</p>

<p>— TT</p>
<p>The flower girl, Cui'er, every early morning, her calling out to sell flowers always缠绕 around in front of my apartment.</p>
<p>The sound is sharp and thin, clear and slightly sad. Whenever such a sad sound struck my eardrum, my heart would sometimes feel a slight pang of sadness. I went near the window, opened the window, looked down, and asked her:</p>
<p>"Cui'er, is business good?"</p>
<p>"Not too bad, sir." She always answered this way, and then immediately called out to sell again. She dared not relax her business for a moment, hoping that a basket of fresh flowers would turn into one copper coin after another, following her voice.</p>
<p>She called out from door to door. If her voice rang in front of someone's door, and the front door or back door suddenly opened inward, then her silver-colored thin face would, without a doubt, immediately flash a smile. Rushing forward, then a string of words like "Madam, Sir, Miss" would constantly burst out of her mouth, her attitude so sincere, so pitiful.</p>
<p>She was often like this, never stopping even on rainy days. Therefore, the people near my apartment gradually became familiar with her, especially me. I was confident that I knew her better than others. This was not because I had traded with her more often, but because I admired and sympathized with her diligence in her own business, so I often talked to her, sometimes buying one or two flowers from her, naturally never haggling over the price. She also seemed to think of me as someone</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>She could confide her inner thoughts to.</p>
<p>In this way, I learned that she had only one mother. Her father had died when she was two or three years old. Her mother had worked hard to raise her, but now she couldn't. She couldn't rely on her mother anymore. Her mother's health had been ruined by overwork, and illness refused to leave her for even a step.</p>
<p>One morning, I was sound asleep when suddenly, a "tuk tuk tuk" sound woke me up. I perked up my ears and listened quietly. I immediately realized that someone was knocking on the door. It turned out to be Cui'er standing at the door, shedding tears. She cried out, "Sir," and then sobbed.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Only then did she stop crying and slowly say:</p>
<p>"Sir, please do me a favor and give me a few cents."</p>
<p>"Okay, but why are you crying?"</p>
<p>"Mom doesn't look too good." She couldn't help crying again.</p>
<p>I took the few cents I had on me and gave them to her. She took them and quickly walked downstairs.</p>
<p>After that, I didn't hear her calling out to sell flowers anymore. I didn't even dare to guess the reason for this.</p>

<p>Empty sadness, remembering the short and the long, the fallen leaves are still the same.</p>
<p>However, oh, my heart today is no longer as fragile as it used to be.</p>
<p>I remember what the guest once said: Please look at the flowing waves in the heart of the river: wave after wave after wave, and the boat surges in the heart of the wave: although the boat has suffered twists and turns, the boat remains intact. As long as you move forward, there will be no danger! Otherwise, if you don't move forward or backward, only the surrounding boats will smash you to pieces!</p>

<h3 id="e223">Beside the Sickbed <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Cui Ying</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I've been sick, a rare miracle for me. For seven or eight years, according to the doctor, I have lung disease. Getting this disease is quite comfortable. At that time, I was still in school, and I was "an official" not going to school. Hearing the classmates say that they had been up for several nights during the big exams, I hoped that this disease would last forever. Sure enough, for seven or eight years now, every doctor with a stethoscope has proven that I have lung disease, and I have been comfortable like this until now; not staying up late, not running into trouble in society. But if you think I inherited a considerable inheritance, you are wrong. Writing a little prose like "Beside the Sickbed" in a comfortable illness can prove it.</p>
<p>I started knowing I had this disease naturally after coughing up blood. Most Chinese people get this disease this way. The reason is not that Chinese people pay too little attention to hygiene, it's just that too few are blessed with the fortune to spend a few dollars to go to the doctor to check their health.</p>
<p>Coughing up blood is really a big deal. In fact, although it is "comfortable," I am somewhat afraid of dying in my heart. Going to the doctor for treatment is even more terrible. He said it was third-stage lung disease. He himself diligently smoked a cigar, and disinfected all the instruments with alcohol desperately, as if I was already "gone."</p>
<p>Returning home, I read some lung disease self-treatment ABCs on the sickbed, and ate milk, eggs, and cod liver oil for every meal. At the same time, a friend studying at the medical school came to give me calcium injections every day for free. Worry-free, I sent the first day of the year to the thirtieth day. When I was happy to sleep, I slept for a lifetime. If I wanted to get up and walk around, no one would stop me. For seven or eight years, there has been no sign of death. But it's also strange, my self-treatment can be said to be perfect; staying in a sanatorium at most to shine a sun lamp, I also sunbathe for half an hour every day. This year, encouraged by a friend (the one who gave the injections for free), I spent a few yuan and a few cents to go to the doctor's door. After listening with a stethoscope, he meticulously tapped on my ribs with his orchid fingers. Humph, the sound was a "dong dong" sound. The lung disease self-treatment ABC told me that it was called a clear sound, which is a good phenomenon in the lungs. However, the doctor still shook his head, which made me suspect that the doctor's shaking his head had some connection with his business; he insisted that I take an X-ray, saying it was a terrible third stage and that I had to be hospitalized. This was in early spring this year. After passing the winter, I lived another year, and I still read my self-treatment ABC.</p>
<p>That being said, isn't this disease comfortable enough? I don't know how many stages lung disease is divided into. One stage can last for seven or eight years. If there are ten stages, it cannot be said that it is not long-lived. In this case, cholera vomiting and diarrhea, killing several lives in an hour, is terrifying!</p>

<p>(4) The Stage Could Have Been in Revolt</p>
<p>The big, dark fellow pondered, "I've lived this long and never stood before so many people to speak. Today, they've hoisted me up like a hawk! Damn it! I'll just say a few words, no matter how bad it is!" The guy was even more energetic, standing straight as a military telephone pole at the edge of the stage, his mouth open for a long time, but no sound came out. He was really getting anxious! The small guy standing behind him, seeing things weren't right, quickly leaned over and whispered:</p>
<p>[Didn't a female comrade teach you last night? Just say what she taught you!]</p>
<p>The big, dark fellow became even more flustered. Last night he was only focused on enjoying the moment, and didn't hear what she said. Today was going to be a total disaster!</p>
<p>[The White Army is not as good as the Red Army! Say it!] The small guy was acting as a prompter.</p>
<p>[Right! The White Army is not as good as the Red Army, our National Revolutionary Army is better.] The big, dark fellow felt quite pleased with himself for saying this, but the stage could have been in revolt.</p>
<p>[Counter-revolutionary – Down with him!</p>
<p>Down with this counter-revolutionary!]</p>
<p>At first, the big, dark fellow thought the audience was cheering him on. But then he looked closely and saw that things were not right! Those skinny devils all had their mouths wide open, as if they wanted to devour him alive! The big, dark fellow wanted to turn around and run, but the guy acting as the prompter grabbed him, and shouted at the same time –</p>
<p>[Comrades: Don't make a fuss! He hasn't made himself clear, let him speak again!]</p>
<p>[You say the Red Army is good, the National Revolutionary Army is murderous arsonists!]</p>
<p>The big, dark fellow was terrified. He couldn't escape, and he had to learn to speak:</p>
<p>[The Red Army is good, the National Revolutionary Army fights well!]</p>
<p>[At that moment, the big, dark fellow rolled off the stage, landing face-first in the dirt. If the slogan [soldiers don't fight soldiers] hadn't been in effect, the big, dark fellow would have been skinned alive, at the very least.]</p>
<p>A few days later, the big, dark fellow had a red cloth strip tied around his neck. The big, dark fellow didn't bother to study the color of the strip. That morning, when he tied the strip, he muttered to himself – "Whether it's stained with pus, blood, or dog blood, it's all the same."</p>

Dimly, Yingying's day was already setting. It wasn't that she didn't obey the instructions of the chamber door. It was only that she was shy and eager to please her family. Because of the rebellious bandit soldiers Sun Longhu. Thousands of times, they made a clamor and uproar. Foolishly wanting to rob her away. Around the garden, the forest was completely ransacked. Her own mother had personally promised her to Li. But now, the marriage was being denied without any reason. Harming him, making him sick inside the West Chamber. Thinking about his feelings, the blame lay with her. She heard that Hong Niang was advising her. Asking about illness should involve sending a cup of tea. Tonight, she would ask him about his illness.</p>

<p>Opening: Resist Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Eastern neighbor relies on its power to run rampant. Insidiously encroaching upon our territory. Millions of brave soldiers have been asleep for too long. The generals have no strategy, the falcons soar. Our great rivers and mountains are willingly given away. Bearing resentment, they compete and bicker like siblings. Repairing the fold after the sheep is lost is not too late. Saving the poor and enriching the country lies in industry and commerce. Talk about practical industry. Open up transportation. The doors should be opened equally for mutual trade. Resisting is not difficult if we seek practicality. It is important not to have our hearts and mouths say different things to the East. Why? I loudly appeal to all gentlemen. Substituting plums for peaches has other intentions. Domestically produced goods seem thick and profitable, and when profits are in sight, enemies can be forgotten. Therefore, resisting goods has been done countless times. Imported goods still fill the market. I hope that compatriots, after ten years of constant effort, will not covet the fine goods of other countries. Tax rates are reduced, and costs are lowered. Gradually, we will see the country become wealthy and the military become strong. China's reputation will be known everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="e230">The Success Story of Adventure Film Director Van Dyke <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Van Dyke, a famous Hollywood adventure film director, is the director of the film [Eskimo], which was once shown in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Van Dyke's father was a lawyer, but he died nine days after his birth. At that time, his mother, who was only twenty-one years old, had to join a traveling troupe to perform everywhere for a living. When they traveled to Chartres, Van Dyke was taken by his grandfather to be raised in his home. It was here that Van Dyke was able to complete his secondary education.</p>
<p>After graduating from middle school, he went out into society alone to seek self-reliance. He had worked as a handyman in a station, a salesman in a lighting store, and a groom in a freight store. Later, he joined his mother's traveling troupe.</p>
<p>However, he soon left. Afterwards, he engaged in work in coal mines, ranches, and logging.</p>
<p>In 1915, when he was twenty-seven years old, he was spotted by the famous director Griffith in Greensike, which was the starting point of his new life. Director Griffith loved his ability to work continuously for eighteen hours. When he started filming the masterpiece [Intolerance], he promoted him to assistant director. From that time on, he was determined to serve the film industry for life.</p>
<p>In 1928, for the sake of the exterior scenes of O'Brien's [White Shadows in the South Seas], he and Director Flaherty crossed over to Tahiti Island together. Unfortunately, Director Flaherty suddenly fell ill, and the filming of the exterior scenes had to be suspended for a while. However, Van Dyke took over for Director Flaherty, and about seven months later, he finished filming everything and returned to Hollywood. After the film was released, it won great praise, and Van Dyke suddenly became a famous director in Hollywood.</p>
<p>After gaining fame from his debut work, he was dispatched to Tahiti Island to shoot exterior scenes for a romantic love film starring Ramon Novarro. He finished shooting it in just six weeks, and the film also received praise from all sides. As a result, he greatly developed his skills in producing adventure films, and the famous [Eskimo] was released to the public.</p>
<p>Most film directors, under the supervision of managers, etc. in the studio, can shoot very good films, but once they leave and go to desolate islands or snow-covered mountains, their qualifications as directors are bound to be equal to zero. But Van Dyke is an exception. Even if he goes to the wilderness of Africa to shoot exterior scenes, he can still exert his directorial talents without regret.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Review of [One Night of Love] <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Shuofu</p>
<p>One Night of Love</p>
<p>Da Guangming Cinema Screening</p>
<p>The sound of jazz music is as popular and crazy as can be in the city. Radio broadcasts, records, and even idlers walking on the street will always hum a few new movie songs.</p>
<p>From a long time until now, these vulgar tunes of [irregular Zheng sounds] have really made people tired of listening to them. Surprisingly, in this [One Night of Love], my ears were washed, and my appetite was opened. Undoubtedly, this is a successful work of classical light opera.</p>
<p>Speaking of opera, of course, it is not comparable to turning vulgar tunes such as [folk songs] and [mountain songs] into something that is neither fish nor fowl. This is [pouring out blood from the heart], [fine-tuning the musical scales], carefully considering the six laws and five tones, and undergoing several refinements and arrangements before it can be released to the public. A musician's fame depends entirely on the performance of the opera he directs one night. This is such a bright and great thing in art!</p>
<p>Early on, I was fascinated by music, and I was immediately devoted to a kind of [popular song]. Later, I gradually became able to listen to opera. After I had a considerable understanding of Western opera, I felt that popular songs were really shallow and inferior, and even made my ears crawl.</p>
<p>The plot of [One Night of Love] is very suitable for opera performance. Naturally, harmoniously, symmetrically, and beautifully, it writes out artistic life effortlessly and humorously. It is not only the success of Director Victor Schertainder, but also due to the richness of the plot.</p>
<p>The female lead, Grace Moore, sings with a very high quality. As for using clichés such as [clear voice], [piercing clouds and cracking rocks], [surrounding the beams three times] to praise her, I think it is looking down on her. Only the so-called [glorious voice] that is praised by the general public in Hollywood can be considered accurate.</p>
<p>Supporting actors such as Camina Di (Italian) as the singing teacher, Albani (Spanish) as the pianist, and Mona Bellini as another singer, all complement the brilliance of this play. Only Toul Bowl's Billy has failed to fully display his talents.</p>
<p>In the play, the two operas [Carmen] and [Madame Butterfly] are originally very different foreign styles of songs. When sung by Ms. Grace, they can be compared to Lucrezia Bori, which is also the reason why she is so popular among the new singers in Hollywood.</p>
<p>This film can be considered a fine work among the recent musical films. After watching it, I heard the so-called creative singing of China in the recent radio broadcasts. Recalling that recently, Hollywood business travelers, when they came to China, thought that tunes like Peach Blossom River could represent the recent Chinese national character, I simply got goosebumps all over my body.</p>
<p>Struggling with the pain of illness to write this introductory review, although it is a suffering, it is also quite pleasant. Perhaps good artistic works have the effect of sending away poverty and driving away malaria.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Review of [The Sea Killers] <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>“The Sea Killers” - Golden Field</p>
<p>As the title indicates, this film should be a strange underwater adventure. But in reality, there are so many descriptions of the sea surface; and the exploration process, which should be the climax of this film, is not very dangerous.</p>
<p>Here, let's offer some opinions as a documentary about the sea.</p>
<p>As a long subtitle in front of the screen, it says: In 1868, a ship carrying gold set sail from San Francisco and was sunk by pirates in the waters of Mexico. It has never been salvaged.</p>
<p>The picture starts with the voyage of a team of adventurers seeking to find the remaining gold, followed by many records of fishing, otter catching, whale swimming, and seagull flying seen during the voyage. Finally, they reach the Crystal Rock where the sunken ship is located, and a person takes a [lifeline] to sink to the bottom of the sea, encountering a shark, which breaks his [lifeline]. His companions return in disappointment and sorrow.</p>
<p>Since, as mentioned earlier, there are not many dangerous scenes or tense atmosphere, the impression given to the audience from beginning to end is not deep. In some places, it is clear that the fishermen used sharp forks to throw into the sea, but when the fish that was caught was pulled onto the boat, what was taken out of the fish's mouth was a hook. This gives people a feeling of unreality. Also, such as several times when the caught fish is pulled up from the sea, in addition to the fish's struggle, due to the different size and nature of the fishermen themselves, they are mostly pulled onto the boat in the same way, which makes the original so-called [strange] a bit commonplace.</p>
<p>Only the sea otter escaping, the seaweed swirling, and the group of fish vying for a shellfish after the underwater explorer cut it open gave us extremely beautiful impressions and wild fun. When the caught Corvina is lifted up: a tall person is used to compare it, and it is not even as long as the fish. It is quite commendable to pull open the fish's mouth to show the length of the mouth and the sharpness of the teeth.</p>
<p>The description says that someone on the ship unintentionally killed a dolphin that seafarers regarded as a close friend. Therefore, the whole ship was shocked, but we did not see this scene on the screen. The blue shark, which is the protagonist of this sea exploration, and is called the devil who kills people on the sea without blinking an eye, is only shown to us without showing its ferocity.</p>

<p>In Li Pingqian's [Homeless], the lives and struggles of people in today's society are depicted calmly and profoundly. The play describes a hardworking dock worker, although his daily wages are so meager that he cannot support a family of three, he can never forget to drink old wine and gamble on Pai Gow. As a result, he lost his only four cents. He thought that his wife and children were waiting for him hungry, waiting for his four cents to buy medicine to treat his son who was unfortunately burned by fire.

<p>— Li Xin</p>
<p>A few days passed, and May felt something was strange, so she went to ask Newland: "Newland, you've been here for a few days, and you hardly speak, as if you're unhappy. What's wrong? Newland, tell me, is there someone else? Tell me honestly. I've felt it strange for a long time—ever since we got engaged." Her eyes fixed on him, her lips trembling slightly. After a moment, she said again: "Newland, tell me, could a person easily do something wrong?" Newland remained silent for a long time, and May then said: "Newland, if you feel you've done something wrong, if you have another beloved, I don't want you to be separated from her because of me...no matter what..." She tried hard to be brave, but she couldn't hold on. Suddenly, she started to cry, reaching out her hands to embrace him, clinging to him like a frightened child. Newland remembered his purpose in coming to Florida, and he couldn't help but scold himself for being too cruel. He hugged her tightly, wiped away her tears, and comforted her, saying: "Oh, May, I don't have anyone else, but I want to marry you immediately. Long engagements are okay for some people, but I..." May raised her head and said softly to him: "I always thought I loved you, but I never knew how deeply I loved you until today. Oh, Newland, do you love me too? Do you? Can't you live without me? Is that right?" Newland was a tender-hearted person by nature, and at this moment, he felt compelled to tell a lie. So he deceived her, saying: "That's right. I can't live without you." As he spoke, he kissed her. That evening, he left Florida and returned to New York.</p>
<p>After Newland returned to New York, he was afraid that seeing Elaine would make him forget the impressions he had gained in Florida, so he didn't go to see Elaine for a week. But after a week, he couldn't stand it anymore. So one afternoon, he ran to Mrs. Minggu's house for tea, hoping to run into Elaine there. That day, he found Elaine in the flower room, she was cutting roses. He couldn't help but call out: "Elaine!" Elaine saw him and immediately put down the roses and scissors, stood silently for a moment, then turned around, reached out her hand to Newland, and cried out: "My darling, my treasure!" Newland hugged her, and the two of them couldn't speak for a long time. Later, she pushed him away, reached out her hand, and touched a blade of grass's tender flower. The flower closed immediately at her touch and withered very quickly. Elaine then said softly: "Newland, didn't you see that little flower just now? Life touched it, and it died. Newland, we have also been touched by life, and we will also die." Newland mumbled: "Elaine, Elaine. Don't say those words! We've only just begun to live! When I was in Florida, I must have become neurotic. I'll go tell May now! She'll understand. I'll go to Florida again to see May in the next few days. We can't be separated! We'll never have to be afraid again." Elaine listened, leaned against the door of the flower room, and muttered to herself: "Oh, God! Why did I come back?" Newland hugged her again and said: "For this. For this." He kissed her. Suddenly, someone outside shouted: "Newland, Newland! Where are you?" Newland's hands dropped down. He and Elaine looked at each other, because it was May Welland's voice, May rushed towards the flower room, like a child who hadn't seen her mother for half a day. (To be continued)</p>
