<h3 id="c19">中國之糧食問題　廷 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>我國糧食恐慌。飢饉時作。小農力耕。非不辛苦。而富歲僅够圖溫飽。凶年不免於溝壑。少壯者乃不得不鋌而走險。流爲盜寇。（民以食爲天）。糧食問題不解决。必無民生安定之可言。</p>
<p>由國府行政院組織之農村復興委員會。早以調劑糧食爲其四大計劃事項之一。最近四中全會開會。劉峙朱家驊陳立夫周啓剛四委員。復提議統制全國糧食。以促農村復興。其所擬辦法綱要。業經日前三百九十三次中央政治會議通過。移交全國經濟委員會。凡此皆爲當局關懷民食之表徵。夙稱錯綜複雜之糧食問題。或有相當解决之一綫曙光。</p>
<p>糧食之成爲問題。首因生産與消費。不能適相調劑。生産寡而消費多。發生糧荒之危險。反之。則受糧食過剩之累。我國今日患在糧荒。固盡人所知。補救　一五。當着眼於生産之增加及消費之减少。爰就吾人　見所及。略述如下。</p>
<h3 id="c20">增加生産 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>第一擴充耕地面積其法有三（甲）嚴禁種植烟苗各地軍嚴割據一方　兵自重。種烟牟利。如川湘雲貴豫陜閩粤諸省。種烟之風。尤稱普遍。不惟佔據有用地面。抑且虚耗人工資本。烟苗生長期間。又適與豆麥雜糧直接衝突。兩。</p>
<p>者不可得兼。罌粟旣盛。雜糧之收成自减。（乙）打破土葬習俗。我國社會。崇尚宗法。營葬親長。爲子弟應盡之責。富貴之家。築壟封樹佔地尤廣。且土地愈肥美。居民愈密集。而葬於其地之死者亦愈多。土地有限制。營葬無已時。沃土佳壤。乃日益减少。（丙）開墾邊區荒地。我國邊疆諸地。如東三省蒙古新疆西藏寗夏靑海等省。皆多豐草繁茂之原野。縱橫千里。一望無際。除種植麥黍之小部分外。草萊未闢。可惜孰甚。如能移民殖邊。或駐兵屯墾。旣足調劑本部過剩之人口。復爲國防及民生之一助。</p>
<p>第二。獎勵種植稻麥。我國南人食米。北人嗜麵。麥爲麵之原料。年來帝國主義者。對我之經濟侵略。步步加緊。洋米洋麥之巨量輸入。尤足使我農村經濟。爲之解體。而國内農民貧圖厚利。往往種植菸葉等類。稻田麥壟遂相形見絀。卽如豫魯皖三省所産美種菸葉。年達一萬五千萬磅。農户每年收入約三千萬元之鉅。人之趨利如水之就下。固不足怪。</p>
<p>第三。利用人力資本。我國苦於兵匪騷擾。影響農作。待爲顧著。兵匪多係少壯之農民肵變成驅數十百萬之生産分子爲破壞分子國家所受之損失爲何如。資本缺乏固因人民之生計困難。然苟政治淸明。社會安寗。亦不致使全國資本。集中於少數在帝國主義者庇護下之通商城市。因以造成内地金融凍結之現象。</p>
<p>第四。改良農事技術。此點明白易解。勿庸贅述。</p>
<h3 id="c21">减少消費 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>第一。限制人口增殖。我國人口以土地面積爲比例。其密度殊不爲高。然因分配不得其當。人民之生産效率。又嫌太低。乃有人滿之患。限制人口增殖。本有天然的與人爲的之别。前者借天然力而推動。殘酷不近人道。後者除戰爭外。頗爲文明國家之所當講究。</p>
<p>第二。節制食物糜費。國人素抱多食主義。富家宴會徵逐。糜費更甚。卽如釀酒所耗之糯米高粱等數量。已堪驚人。自當一一研究撙節之道。以補民食之不足。</p>
<p>惟誠如劉朱陳周四委提案所言。茲事體大。（非有全國通籌。中樞恊謀整個支配系統措施細大不捐泛應曲當　宏猷巨規不爲功）故有待於朝野人士之共同努力。不然。如遇飢饉襲來。死亡盈野。始言急賑之方臨渴掘井。雖勞奚益</p>

<p>行禮如儀後、卽由主席朱部長報告云、中英電台、自從上年一月開始興工以來、至上年年底、一切工程、均已建築完竣、經過多次的試騐、結果很好、今天舉行開幕典禮、開始正式通報、從此以後、中英間的無綫電訊、可以直接通達了、今日以前、中英的電訊、可以直接通達的、全恃外商經營的水綫、至於無綫電信的通達、則僅由中法綫路或中德綫路接轉、没有直接通電的設備、這種偏頗的情形、很使我們引爲遺憾、中國國際電信的發展、起初是利用水綫、而水綫電訊事業、則以中英水綫電訊的設備經營爲最早、可是自從中國在民國二十年建設了國際無綫電台、自動的開始發展了國際無綫電信、以謀與世界作更周密的連絡</p>
<p>以後、中美·中法·中德·中俄·中瑞·都相繼有了無綫電的直接交通、乃至馬尼刺·巴達維亞·等處、亦可以直接用無綫電通訊、而利用永綫最早的中英電信交通、在無綫電方面、反而落後、這不是一件足以引爲遺憾的事麽、所以我們趕快的設法、添築了這座中英電台、使得中國與英國在無綫電的交通上、與其他諸國、有同一的連絡、更期中國與世界無綫電交通的全部連絡、得以完成、這次中英電台的完成、尚有更深的意義、耐八尋味的、中英間自來關係的密切、我們從報務上便可以看得出來、中國每年與倫敦間來往的電報、據我們統計、要佔據我們歐洲報費收入總數的一半以上、單在這個統計上面、就可以看得出中央的關係、有何等的</p>
<p>密切、我們重視這種密切的關係、我們尤其重視中英間要利用這種密切的關係、以增加合作互助的努力、因爲無論在敎</p>
<p>育上、文化上、經濟上、中英兩國、都需要相互的恊助、我們建築中英電台的用意、卽在希望這種友誼與合作、在物質設備上、多一重便利、更希望利用這種物質設備的便利、使中英間的友誼與合作、更形密切、只看這一年來、中國雖値内憂外患財政支絀的時候、對於這座中英電臺的建設、仍舊不因環境的困難而間斷、就可以知道我們對於中英電臺的使命、有如何的厚望了、現在中央電臺業已完成、我</p>

<p>朱部長報告畢、繼由中央黨部代表及國民政府代表吳鐵城市長致詞云、今天交通部國際電信局國際電台、舉行中英直達電路開幕典禮、鐵城奉命中央、參與盛典、願致其期望之忱、我們用歷史的眼光來觀察、交通的發展、實在是現代各國政治進步之一個偉大的原動力、單就郵電兩點說、自一八八一年直至一九一三年、英國郵局的數量、自一五四○○所增至二四六○○所、法國自六七○○所、增至一五七○○所、德國自一二五○○所、增至五一六○○所、同時、各國人民、每年平均之郵件、英人自四○件增至九六件、法人自一六件、增至四○件、德人自一七件、增至八○件、這種郵件發展和增加的數字、就可以衡量出現代歐洲各國政治進步的程度、現代國際關係、日趨複雜、而各民族間互助合作之機會和需要、也與日俱增、則今後的郵電、自然是改善國際關係、敦睦民族情感、不可忽視的利器、英國史家魔爾斯氏Ｈ·Ｇ·Ｗ。</p>
<p>ＬＬＳ曾經說、中歐民族之所以不能彼此了解、實緣於彼此情形的隔閡、這種國際間的缺陷、我們自然要努力把他彌補、把他消除、中國古語說、人定勝天、現代物質的文明、交通的發展、旣已打破了從前人類無可打破的宇宙間天然的與物質的障碍、我們又何嘗不可更進一步、來謀努力消除民族間情感上與精神上的隔閡、所以、今日交通部國際電信局國際電台中英直達電路的開幕、就是表示中國民族、對於消除民族隔閡、彌補國際缺陷之努力的開始、中英直達電路以後、非但</p>
<p>可增中英兩大民族彼此往還的便利、而且更可敦中英兩大民族的睦誼、</p>

<p>上海市商會主席王曉籟演說云、今天爲交通部國際電台舉行中英直達綫路開幕典禮、換一句話說、可說是中國在歐洲爭得了一個說話的嘴巴、我們時常聽見人家說、講到軍事動作、最要緊的是海口、因爲有了海口、運輸便利、所以打起仗來、第一步是封鎖人家海口、海口一封鎖、進又不能進、出也不能出、彷彿叉住了一個人的咽喉、這個人非悶死不可、但是我們要知道、現在的世界、不光是一個用武器來戰爭的世界、還要注意平時的宣傳的工作、可是說起宣傳工作、必得有一張嘴巴、倘使自已是個啞吧、說話要靠人家、有時你要說的話、人家不替你代說、或者你不願意說的話、人家倒替你到處宣揚、久而久之、積非成是、你一肚子的委曲、又能向何處發洩、我想、不說是惡意的宣傳、有心把是非顚倒、就是無意的錯誤、已經可以使你大大的受影響了、那末、現在宣傳的嘴巴、是什麽呢、就是國際電信事業、四十年來、我國的國際電信事業、一向歸外商水綫公司經營、我們要向外國人說話、先得經過外國人的喉嚨、這眞是何等不便、我想、說得輕一點、呌做利權外溢、說得重一點、間直是太阿倒持、利權外溢、是失了電信的利益、太阿倒持、是失了電信的權力、所以往往有許多事情、明明是如此如此、而傳到了外國、却變成這般這般、最可笑的、連中國駐外公使領事、要知道本國的消息、也得向外國電信機關去問、大家想可笑不可笑呢、所以國民政府、在廣東的時候、已經注意到這一點、從十八年到廿三年、這六年之中、經交通部繼續不斷的努力、擴充了上海到馬尼刺·香港·巴達維亞·舊金山·柏林·巴黎·西貢·日内瓦·莫斯科·等九處的直接通報綫路、現在又加了上海倫敦間的直達綫路、我們知道、上海是中國的電信樞紐、倫敦又是歐洲的電信樞紐、所以上海倫敦間的直達綫路、我開始就說是中國在歐洲、爭得了一個說話的嘴巴、這當然是一件可以祝賀的事啊、</p>

<p>顔大使昨在輪次、接見各報社記者、據談、本人於去年十二月八日、離莫斯科起程、一月十日、由意境登輪啓椗、此次返國、絕無任務、僅因久不返國、故特向中央請假返國、并報告在外情形、本人離國已達兩年之久、於國内情形、諸多隔膜、亟思返國一行、卒因事務繁多、不獲如願、現已安返國土、如無緊急之事變發生、擬作數月之勾留、然後再行返任銷假、</p>

<p>日俄關係、邇來漸趨緊張、戰事之爆發、頗屬可能、惟港電所傳余之談話、則未免言之遇甚耳、蘇俄對於遠東頗爲注意、一方固希望和平之得以保持、一方則凖備予侵略者以迎頭之痛擊、至於我國目前固希望維持東亞之和平、然亦急須充實國力、以謀應付當前之緊急事變、</p>

<p>中俄復交之後、蘇俄</p>
<p>對於中國之、感情甚好、蘇俄五年計劃之結果、頗爲良好、目前正進行實現第二五年計劃、蘇俄對於滿洲僞國、絕不承認、惟以地處交接、故事實上之往來、實所難免、關於中東路之談判、蘇俄希望必須得到相當之代價、始可讓渡、美俄此次復交、對於遠東之和平、可謂有力之保障、</p>

<p>各國過去承認　如欲維持世界之和平、端賴國際聯盟　作爲保障、但自中日事件發生之後、歐洲各國、均感國聯之力量、不足以維持世界和平、深覺有自衛之必要、以致造成各國備戰之趨勢、歐洲各國、對於遠東均加以密切之注意、蓋均深信遠東事件、足以影響歐洲各國也、</p>

<p>讀書的嚴肅性</p>
<p>讀書指導：新文藝是鋒芒的利刃，能够有力的刺戮人類麻痺的心肝：是宏亮的鐘聲，能够震醒人類殘忍的迷夢；是···當然新文藝的效用，不僅這麽單純，我不過隨着所感到的寫兩個作例罷了。</p>
<p>可是，就以上的一部分的感覺，這感覺，滲進了我的心腔裏，經過我的靑春的火燄的燃燒，更回憶起過去幸福（讀書）的幻滅，在心上起了種種甜酸苦辣的滋味，增加了我對於新文藝的信仰心和創作的野心。</p>
<p>但，我是一個小學卒業後就輟學了的人。以那樣幼稚的國學程度，懷着偌大的願望，同時又曹着現在的約束的境遇，雖則未來總可以擺脫點，可是把不可知的，未來的努力的結果，和過去的及現在的空虚一擬比，眞呌我有些茫然。在困難地無規律地自修中，腦裏常會浮現出渺茫來。</p>
<p>過去的自修，我只不斷的看着文藝小說，認點陌生字彙，有時甚至連字彙已懶得查，不能瞭解的地方，（如洋文洋典過於玄妙的奥意幽默等）也是請敎無門。就這樣，就這樣，光陰是飛逝了，年齡是增大了，自磋的成績呢？空虚，迷茫。</p>
<p>所以，我的未來，　希望我的未來，能有比過去有規律點速成點的效果實現。</p>
<p>但是，我現在除了看看文藝，認認字彙之外，那有規律的計劃呢？速成點的計劃呢？啊！這並不是惡劣的依懶性的暴現，實在是我缺少智能而又遲鈍的腦筋所不能想及的喲！</p>
<p>讀書指導、只有請你切實的啓示了。（周筠來信）</p>
<p>像周君這樣的來信，我們已收到了好多封，雖然内容不免有些空洞，所憧憬的也不過是一個糢糊的希望，實在使我們無由作出具體的回答，但是，我們仍覺得這類的通信也是很重要的，因爲這正是一般隨便（玩玩）文學的朋友，最易犯的一種毛病。許多朋友因爲生活的苦悶或一時爲了無聊的心情，多拏小說詩歌來消悉解悶，有些人更完全抱着消閑享樂的態度者，都缺乏一種研究的（嚴肅性）。所以大半以（好讀書不求甚解）爲滿足，隨隨便便玩玩她，與看一張影片一樣，不去體會這件精緻的藝術品内的神髓。像這樣的，讀來讀去，書在數量上雖然一天天的增多，却對於無論那一派的作品，那一本我著都未能有深刻的了解。腦中留着的是一層朦朧的印象；而自已的情緖不能與著者的崇高的情緖相接觸，自然不能受到心的感應，得到精神的聯結。祇看故事中的事實的結構，是容易使精神煥散，興趣低減，所以缺乏（研究的嚴肅性）的結果，每每如（出了氣的啤酒）一般的淡然無味。</p>
<p>這種讀書的態度養成後，很不易於改變。一般不甘這種苦悶的靑年，於是就懷疑到自已的（智能），或（腦筋）不及人上去，喊出（空虚）（迷茫）來。消極的人，以爲自已無可爲了，就（媽媽虎虎）過去；勇敢一點的人，想擬出一些希望，可是提出來的也無非像周君似的（那有規律的計劃呢？），自然，我們對於這類的讀者是萬分同情的。</p>
<p>我們希望的是，請周君及與周君有同病的朋友，首先改變（看看文藝）的態度，進一步抱着嚴肅的研究心，認眞的把他作一門艱難的學科來學習。</p>
<p>大凡眞値得崇拜的人，一下子不能知道他的偉大，要漸漸的才會懂得他的特質，在文藝上面，也是一樣，眞値得讀的高級作品。並不一定是蜜一樣的甜，桂花般的香，極容易攝引人家來讀，它也許常常帶些苦味，或者初看竟是一個乾燥無味的故事。讀者吟味這些作品，除要精心注意外，還要有些預備知識，否則，你要直接親炙作品的内容就眞要比（粗綫穿過針鼻一樣難）。</p>
<p>（精心）可由學習養成，但預備知識則在自已增進其他的知識。關於後者，讀者應備相當的社會科學知識，奠位研究文藝理論的基礎。同時分一部分精神到文藝理論方面去。（理論）是打開作品之門的匙鑰。</p>
<p>周君！你的讀書計劃，因爲我們不知道你的生活，不能代你擬製，這是你自已的事，我們只能供你一點意見，讓你參考。但我們目下希望你抱着嚴肅的態度進而學習文藝理論。你的文字頗有可觀，腦筋並不遲鈍，依我們想，你頗有文學的前途，不必灰心，努力邁進罷！　　至於如何來學習理論，也要按你的程度而定，不能在此答覆。好在本部正在草擬怎樣自學文學一書，不久可以出版，或者那小册子可供你一些提示罷。不過，在未出版前，暫時介紹錢謙吾著：怎樣研究新興文學？給你先作顧問。</p>
<p>以後還希望周君曁一般與周君有同感的讀者儘可提出一些更具體的問題，如（洋文典，過於玄妙的奥意，幽默）等來研究，我們無不盡其所能代爲解答。</p>

<p>杭州的西湖上面，有一條堤呌蘇堤，這堤是有來歷的。原來宋朝有位大名鼎鼎的文豪呌做蘇東坡，他曾在杭州做官。在他未去做官以前，那西湖上面還没有那條蘇堤的，但往往有一種巨大的怪風從湖畔的山上面吹下湖來，常使湖上的小舟傾覆。蘇東坡去做官時，便時常因此而憂慮，苦於想不出好方法。却是有一天，他正在喝茶時，因爲茶燙便用嘴一吹，那獨浮水面的一條茶梗也隨着波而起伏，却仍不沉，蘇東坡便突然生智，就吩咐在吹覆小舟的一部份湖面造起一條長堤來，以後船覆的情形果然也没有了，那條堤便稱它蘇堤。</p>

<p>人與獅子</p>
<p>有一次一隻獅子和一個人同在路上走，他們都講着自已是偉大的故事。走了一會，漸漸走近路旁的石像了。走到了細細一看，郤是一座人與獅子的石像。人的一隻手，叉住獅子的咽喉。這個人指着這座石像，對獅子說道：</p>
<p>（那！看啊，我們比你們要强多少啊！我們是動物中的主人翁。）但是這隻獅子很快的回答道：（這種東西是你們做成的，所以做得這樣：假使獅子也知道怎樣彫刻石像，那麽你就要看看獅子伸着掌，抓在人的頸上的石像了。）</p>
<p>農夫與鶴</p>
<p>有一個農夫，張一個網在他的田裏，捕捉這種常來偷吃穀粒的鸛。有幾隻鸛給他捉住了，内中郤有一隻鶴在着。這隻鶴是跛足，懇求農夫釋放它。</p>
<p>（我不是鸛啊，）它說。（我是一隻鶴。我是一隻良善的鳥類，知道孝養我的父母。請你看我身上羽毛的顔色，這是不像鸛身上羽毛的顔色啊。）</p>
<p>但是這個農夫說道：（羽毛的顔色同不同，我並不知道。我只知道和鸛一起捉着的，你只能和鸛一起的處死。）</p>

<p>明兒忽然想起一個問題：（爲什麽在夏天大家都穿白色的衣服，在冬天便没有人穿了？）他不能解决，便去問他的叔父。</p>
<p>他的叔父對他說：（等到天下了雪，地上的雪將要融化的時候，你用一張白紙和一張黑紙，放在雪面上，把這問題去問太陽。太陽可以回答你的。）</p>
<p>明兒聽了他叔父的話，心中很是納罕。他想，太陽在高高的天空裏，呌我怎樣上去問他？伊有没有脚和口，也决不會下來告訴我的。叔父的話眞不懂。</p>
<p>他心中雖然很猜疑，但是，有一天，他見天下雪了，非常歡喜。隔了一夜，雪止了，天公放晴，地上的雪便有融解的意思。他就把凖備好的一張白紙和一張黑紙，遵照他叔父的話，舖在雪的上面。自已直立在旁邊看着。</p>
<p>他看了大約有兩點多鐘，心中明白了。他想，叔父並没有騙我；太陽的確能告訴我的。</p>
<p>原來他立着對兩張紙看了兩點多鐘之後，突然發現黑紙下面的雪比白紙下面的融解得快。他再一想，就知道白的東西不及黑的東西會吸收熱；所以夏天大家要穿白色的衣服和戴白的帽子，使太陽光的熱不十分厲害的照到人體上，人體就可以凉些。</p>
<p>他很得意地奔到叔父面前說：（叔父！大陽眞肯告訴人的；我現在已經明白了。）叔父對他笑了一笑，說：（好孩子，你眞聰明啊！）</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>很古時代的人類是非常怕黑暗的：太陽一下山，地面上一片漆黑的時候，他們的心裏就恐慌起來。甚至於到了今日，在非洲的野蠻人中，他們怕黑暗，也是比怕什麽都厲害。因爲到了夜裏，各種躱着的野獸都出來；各種危險都包圍攏來了。他們是多麽歡喜光明啊。但是他們無論怎樣畏懼黑暗，黑暗終是每天要來。後來，人類想出得到光明的方法了：他們發現在燒木柴的時候，旣取了暖，又得了亮光。隨後，他們在行路時，從柴火堆中，取出一枝來，拿在手裏照着路徑，這就是火把。他們又發現了動物的油可以燃燒，就製成了火炬和臘燭。他們又發明了油燈，起初用貝壳和石頭製成，後來用陶器和銅製成。這些燈的芯是用燈草製成的。油燈的樣式有多種，有用繩懸起的懸燈，有直立的柱燈。安放臘燭的器具也有好幾種，如燭盤，燭籤，燭臺，燭聚等。燈芯草燈是把燈芯草浸在油裏而製成的。十八世紀時，瑞士人發明了煤油燈，是燈的一大進步？因爲有了玻璃罩，可以使燈光穏定，不像舊式油燈那樣搖晃不定。科學越發達，燈的進步也更快。一七九二年煤氣燈發明了。一八七九年愛迪生創造了電燈。至於紗罩燈，弧光燈，普照投射燈，探海燈，都是近代所發明的，他們發出那末大的亮光，照到那末遠的路，古代人類是做夢也想不到的。</p>

<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>暹羅的風俗，人民對於國王，好像神佛一樣的信仰，所以無論何等身分的人，都要一次出家皈依佛敎的，若是没有經過皈依的法度，那就要爲社會體所唾棄，不認其爲人類。皈依的法度，除了誦經外，還要每朝托　，皈依的時候，不論王子王孫，貴族的兒女，都是與貧乏人的小兒一道兒修行，不分貧富貴賤，完全一律待遇，没有高低上下，假使貧苦的小兒們，敲着鉦，立到人家的門口，那末隨便那一家必定拿了飯菜送給這小孩子吃，這是因爲信仰佛敎慈悲心很深的暹羅人，一視同仁的美風，所以暹羅境内，没有乞丐與竊盜的。十餘年前，友人視察暹羅回來，他說了一件新奇的故事，上有一天，他在盤谷郊外遊玩，忽然來了三個兒童，他以爲是乞丐，拿些麵包與菓子，分給他們，那兒童很誠摰的朝西禱告了一會，叩謝而去了。後來他聽到旁邊人說：他們原來是很可憐的孤兒，由附近的人家小兒們，醵資養大的過了一個月，暹羅王聽到這個消息，非常憐惜，也拿出一筆錢，補助附近的人家，養育那三個兒童，聽說那三個兒童，都是勤苦力學，現在都爲暹羅國的干城了。所以相信佛敎，從幼養成了慈悲仁愛心的暹羅國，可說靠佛敎治國的，他們國内能够太平無事，没有盜賊，没有乞丐，就是他們國人富於慈善心的緣故啊。</p>

<p>（附白）在夏季的時候，如果手出了汗，拿起（筆桿）不是很濕滑嗎，也可以用這個方法；不過最好要改用（蠶絲）綁捲，以後汗手拿（筆桿）也就不濕滑了。</p>

<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>在影戲院中，菱兒扭着母親問道：（媽媽！這白壁上的人物，爲什麽會得活動？母親說道：（好孩子！這問題你問得很有意思；不過這不是三言二語所可了解的，等歇到家裏去，讓我慢慢地講解給你聽吧！</p>
<p>在晚上，母親一切事情都完畢之後，伊拉着菱兒的手，說道：（白天在影戲院裏的問題，我現在可以講給你聽了；不過單是講解，還不够，除非是要有一種實際的試騐才可以）。伊頓時皺了皺眉，忽然若有所得的說道：（有了）！伊一面說着，一面找了一個洋鐵皮的圓形的餅乾罐頭，把罐底的中央，鑽了一個小洞，用一根綫穿過，預備懸空掛着。（如圖中一）又在底上挖了幾個較大的窟窿，（如圖中二）讓裏面可以有充足的光綫；在罐頭的周圍，也挖成二三十條長方形的罅縫，（如圖中三）這是預備支配光綫的裂瓣；然後拿罐口的邊沿，向内摺進約二三分，（如圖中四）可以安放畫片，使不會落掉。母親把罐頭預備好了以後，又剪了幾張一樣大小的紙片，畫上有連續性動作的賽跑姿勢的運動圖畫，把來安放在罐内裂瓣下面的摺進之處</p>
<p>母親一切裝置好了之後，就把罐頭掛在電燈光的下面旋轉起來，說也奇怪，菱兒從裂瓣縫中望將進去，覺得裏面的畫片，一霎時忽然活動起來，和剛纔在電影院内的活動影戲差不多。</p>
<p>那時，母親對菱見說道；（因爲人的眼睛，看見了一種東西，對於這東西的形狀，不會立刻就消失；至少有十分之一秒的繼續性。所以凡是一個動作没有完全消失，另一個連續的動作，不斷地繼續上來的時候，在人的腦海中，似乎都變成了連續不斷的動作。電影的發明家，就是利用了這一個原理，把一捲連續照相的軟片，連續不斷地旋轉起來；並且應用映射機，把畫像映出，所以我們在影戲院内所見到的圖面，會得自由活動，像眞的人一樣！</p>

<p>大失所望以法商最近兩次失敗、昨日東華遇戰法商、認爲東華爭奪覇權之極好機會、球迷無不熱烈擁護、但臨塲竟嗜閉門羹、誠令人大失所望、東華之所以缺席、據謂以李寗之被罰停賽、萬象華北征未歸、人數不足、故不能出席云云、然何勿未雨綢繆、而至臨塲變卦、最奇怪者、東華不能出席之情形、意先通知西文報紙發表、中國報紙記者、隔夜均會詢問陣線等事、旣不告知何人代替李萬之職、又無不能出席之表示、此實令人不解者、</p>
<p>負責無人據恊進會幹事周家騏談、上午八時半見某西報載東華恐不能出塲之消息後、卽馳赴東華詢問眞相、先詢隊長屠開元、屠謂本人只知在球塲選擇塲面等事、不知其他、再問幹事陸鍾恩、答言不知、於是該隊之是否出塲、一無眉目、</p>

<p>先開紀錄</p>
<p>曁南小將、果然精神抖擻、不稍示弱、五分鐘内、先獲一球、是球由中鋒陳彬帶球前進、挑過西商後術法平、守門哥德金奔出搶球、撲一個空、球落、門線上、丘振安趕上撥入、乃開紀錄、西商開球後、左翼深入、傳球至門前、曁南守衛失脚、梅洪寳亦未接得、說時遲、那時快、球已至門之右角、距門不到一碼、西商右翼阿台趕到、勢在必進、不料此公操之過急、射成野球、觀者無不爲之捧腹大笑、</p>
<p>一失再失局勢平淡過去、約在半小時時、西商史篤克中央送球右方、右翼阿台穿過兩關、在底線傳中、曁南衛兵不及趕回、海特萊已追至門下、乘勢將球一挺、梅洪寳措乎不及、遂告失乎、上半時一比一和局、下半時開始後、西商氣燄忽盛、攻勢極猛、曁南忙於招架、遑論進攻、梅洪寳雖亦能救出不少險球、卒被金勃射中一球、曁南遂以一比二屈伏焉、</p>
<p>裁判受辱曁南已成被壓迫之弱小民族、前鋒勢孤力單、徒然心有餘而力不足、西商方興未艾、咄咄逼人、一次梅洪寳雙乎抱球、略一遲疑、被西商海特萊衝上一撞、連人帶球、跌入門内、裁判倫諾斯判此球作廢、反罰西商、引起某西人看客之反抗辱駡、後曁南被罰十二碼球、西該人又駡裁判員吹毛求疵、倫諾期大發雷霆之怒、乃奔至看台前、痛責該西人、華人觀客、大爲鼓掌、據其事後之申明、梅洪寳跌入門内之球、所以不算、因金勃用脚撬而非撞、所以判罰西商也、</p>

<h3 id="c237">北人與南人 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 樂廷石</p>
<p>這是看了（京派）與（海派）的議論之後，牽連想到的！｜北人的卑視南人，已經是一種傳統。這也並非因爲風俗習慣的不同，我想，那大原因，是在曆來的侵入者多從北方來，先征服中國之北部，又携了北人南征，所以南人在北人的眼中，也是被征服者。二陸入晋，北方人士在歡欣之中，分明帶着輕薄，舉證太煩，姑且不談罷。容易看的是，羊街之的（洛陽伽藍記）中，就常詆南人，並不視爲同類。至於元，則人民截然分爲四等，一蒙古人，二色目人，三漢人卽北人，第四等才是南人，因爲他是最後投降的一夥。最後投降，從這邊說，是矢盡援絕，這才罷戰的南方之强，從那邊說，却是不識順逆，久梗王師的賊；子遺自然還是投降的，然而爲奴隸的資格因此就最淺，因爲淺，所以班次就最下，誰都不妨加以卑視了。到淸朝，又重理了這一篇賬，至今還流衍着餘波；如果此後的歷史是不再回旋的，那眞不獨是南人的如天之福。</p>
<p>當然，南人是有缺點的。權貴南遷，就帶了腐敗頽廢的風氣來，北方倒反而乾凈。性情也不同，有缺點，也有特長，正如北人的兼具二者一樣。據我所見，北人的優點是厚重，南人的優點是機靈。但厚重之弊也愚，機靈之弊也狡，所以某先生曾經指出缺點道：北方人是（飽食終日，無所用心）；南方人是（羣居終日，言不及義）。就有閒階級而言，我以爲大體是的確的。缺點可以改正，優點可以相師。相書上有一條說，北人南相，南人北相者貴。我看這並不是妄語。北人南相者，是厚重而又機靈，南人北相者，不消說是機靈而又能厚重。昔之所謂（貴），不過是當時的成功，在現在，那就是做成有益的事業了。這是中國人的一種小小的自新之路。不過做文章的是南人多，北方却受了影響。北京的報紙上，油嘴滑舌，呑呑吐吐，顧影自憐的文字不是比六七年前多了嗎？這倘和北方固有的（貧嘴）一結婚，産生出來的一定是一種不祥的新劣種！</p>
<h3 id="c238">金魚 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 余揚靈</p>
<p>雅人及闊人們總愛在家裏養些生物，以供觀賞。一被他們所養，那些生物大抵變了種。譬如梅花，一定要（以曲爲美，直則無姿；以欹爲美，正則無景；以疏爲美，密則無態），於是（斫直，删密，鋤正）。這曾被龔定菴所非難，以爲他們種出來的都是（病梅）。屬於動物類的，則有一種金魚，據說是鯽的變種，也是供觀賞用的。</p>
<p>我向來不愛這些觀賞類的生物，尤其看不起那頭豐眼突的金魚，每次看牠在玻璃缸中蠕動的時候，我總不相信牠是一種生物，牠那種蠕動，毫無潑刺的生氣，並不像生物的動作。然而就是這不像生物的金魚，近來却使我發生驚異。　同寓的一位小姐就養着這樣的金魚，但只一條，盛在一個小小的面盆裏。當她要回到鄕下去的時候，把金魚和面盆送給我們，說要是高興，只要每日替牠換一次水就得。我們雖然接收了下來，但覺得很好笑，心想這樣的一種東西，過不了一天就要死的，所以隨便把牠放在窗口，一點也不去理會。</p>
<p>天氣一天天的冷了，冷得室内所有的水都結了冰。有一天，我偶而走到窗口，看見那面盆裏面水的也是冰塊了，於是心裏想，那條金魚該是死了罷。仔細一看，牠却躺在面盆邊緣的冰塊上面，還在蠕動，没有死。這使我很驚異，同時發生了一點同情，給牠融掉冰塊，而且換了一盆水。但到第二天，水依然結成冰，第三天，第四天···一連好幾天都是這樣，而那條金魚終於無恙，直至今日，還在並無生氣地蠕動。</p>
<p>我最是少見多怪，爲這事情，也曾思索了好久，同時想到（權力意志）中的尼采的話：（自然對於運命的寵兒是殘酷的···但自然對於卑賤的東西···中等乃至下等的種類，却加以寛容，保護，愛惜。因此，後者常有很大的繁殖力和存續性，前者反而破壞很速，數量减少。）覺得實在是很對的。同時我又想到，中國的人民，在極度的貧困之中，惡劣的環境裏面，也還能繁殖和存續，亦可謂得天獨厚，和金魚差不多。同是生存競爭中的適者。這樣的中國民族，到了將來，或者也會像金魚一樣成爲專供觀賞的民族罷？但這還要算好的，我只怕會變成有毒的菌類。菌類是極下等的生物，而其繁殖力和存續性也最大。</p>
<h3 id="c239">家 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>就是雞，也有一個塒。就是狗，也有一個窩。就是猪，也有一個𣙢。然而，我是没有家了。</p>
<p>家，我那躺在靑山懷中的家，我那躱在綠竹背後的家，聽說還在着。軟軟的谷風，懶懶的太陽，喔喔的雞聲，朶朶的靑烟，想來也還在着，而且正在吹着，照着，呌着，冒着哩。然而，我是不在了。掉一個頭說，家是没有我了。</p>
<p>要說是没有家呢，家却還在着；要說是有家呢，家又没有我。有時候，連我自已也有一點徨惑，實在難於答覆一切愛着我因而問及我底家的人們。然而，祖母底微笑，總是不在了，伯父底糖飴，總是不在了，父親底溫承，總是不在了，弟妹底嬉戲，總是不在了，我却只能這樣地說：我是没有家了。</p>
<p>也許是自已早生了幾十年吧？也許是自已遲生了幾百年吧？眼看着父親底耕田一天一天地减少，眼看着父親底面容一天一天地蒼老，眼看着父親底太息一天一天地增多，眼看着父親底性情一天一天地暴燥，我不能長期忍心地陪着他那種變化，我只能一時忍心地離開了他，而且走得遠遠地。從此，家便没有我了。</p>
<p>幾年來的飄泊生涯，使我時時都容易懷念着家。我懷念着年近百旬的祖母。我懷念着孑然一身的伯父。我懷念着鰥居半生的父親。我懷念着幼失襁褓的弟妹。然而，我却不能不走得遠遠地，就是有家亦不可歸了。</p>
<p>世界上，無家可歸的人還多着呢。然而，我却羡慕他們無家的幸福。充其量，他們只嘗到了那孤獨的悲哀。我更要嘗着這孤獨以上的悲哀啊！至少，我總得再拿出一份眼淚來給與我對於家的懷念。因爲在感情的負担上，究竟還多壓了一個使我懷念的家哪。</p>
<p>到現在，在這里，我可以想到父親正在過着那中世紀　　隸的生活（雖然我們是生在號稱文明的二十世紀底開化最早的國家）。一年十幾次的糧稅，是要他底血汗去完的。一月十幾次的徵發，是要他底血汗去供的。一切的苛捐勒派，已經將他那老骨頭壓得灣灣的了。然而，他還要用他那幾根灣灣的老骨頭撑持着使我懷念的家。他那知道，我所懷念的家早已被人傾了，我是早已没有家了。</p>
<p>浮雲也似的世態，微波也似的生命，能讓我長在空中飄緲，多在水上畫幾道圈兒嗎？我不能永遠都没有家。但我期望人人都有一個，而且是溫柔的，甜寗的。</p>
<h3 id="c240">梁任公在湖南 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>四脚朝天，看你有何能幹？</p>
<p>一耳偏聽，到底不是東西！</p>
<p>這是戍維新運動失敗以後，湖南守舊派嘲笑陳寳箴熊希齡兩人的諧聯，把熊陳兩個字拆開，倒很有趣。原來湖南的戊戍維新運動，是官紳合辦的，陳中丞代表官方，熊庶常代表紳方。這一運動，康梁是主要人物，康有爲在北京，得到光緖帝的信任，所以北京閙得很兇；梁啓超在湖南，得到陳中丞的信任，所以湖南也閙得很兇。梁先生爲什麽來到湖南的呢？據熊希齡上陳中丞書說：延聘梁卓如爲敎習，發端於公度（黃遵憲，時爲湖南鹽法道。）觀察，鄒沅帆及齡與伯嚴（陳三立，陳中丞之子。）皆贊成之。　梁先生來到湖南，主持時務學堂，做了總敎習，同來的韓文舉葉覺邁做了分敎習，康派勢力，一時極盛。而且全堂師生，互相標榜，不說（今日敎學諸人，卽是興朝佐命；）卽說（異日出任時艱，皆學堂十六齡之童子。）這眞是要呌守舊派眼中生出火來的。何况時務學堂日記，課藝評語，南學會講義，以及湘報，湘學報所刊之文章，都是守舊派目爲邪說異端的康派議論呢！</p>
<p>自然，那些被目爲邪說異端的議論，在三十多年以後的今日看來，不免平常，淺薄可笑，但在當日就不免覺得翻江倒海，石破天驚了！例如梁先生評日記云：</p>
<p>二十四朝其足當孔子王號者無人焉，間有數覇者生於其間，其餘皆民賊也。</p>
<p>斥一切帝王爲民賊，只承認其中有幾個覇者，這不能不呌腐儒大吃一驚。又評答問云：臣也者，與君同辦民事者也。如開一舖子，君則其舖之總管，臣則其舖之掌櫃等也。梁先生雖然還没有說出人民是這一舖子的大股東，可是他已經不承認向來腐儒所說的（君臣之義）了。又評課藝云：春秋大同之學，無不言民權者，盍取六經中所言民權者編輯成書，亦大觀也。</p>
<p>梁先生倡言民權，發論頗多。又如評日記云：</p>
<p>公法欲取人之國，亦必其民心大順，然後其國可爲我有也，故能興民權者，斷無可亡之理。又云：議院雖創於泰西，實吾五經諸子傳記隨舉一義多有其意者，惜君統太長，無人敢言耳！　梁先生要主張議會政治了。他倡民權議院之說，却不能不乞靈於什麽五經六經，現在我們或許要笑他迂謬，但想到他在當時環境裏，却又不能不原諒他的苦心了。他評課藝云：今日欲求變法，必自天子降尊始。不先變去拜跪之禮，上下仍習虚文，所以動爲外國笑也。梁先生竟大膽的主張天子降尊，廢拜跪之禮了。又評日記云：中國萑苻甚熾，上無禮，下無學，賊民興，喪無日矣。今日變政，所以必先改律例。衣服雖末事，然切於人身最近，故變法未有不先變衣服者，此能變，無不可變矣。梁先生主張改法律，變衣服，這都是大膽之言，也都是要受湖南守舊派攻擊的了。說也奇怪，湖南人的氣質，好走極端，從戊戍運動起，一直到現在，政治上每一變動，在對抗的兩極端，總是湖南人做先鋒。戊戍運動，站在維新派尖端的有譚嗣同熊希齡諸人；站在守舊派尖端的有葉德輝王益吾諸人。辛亥武昌起義，湖南首先響應，但第一個爲滿淸死節的將官黃忠浩，也是湖南人。袁世凱稱帝，籌安會領袖楊度，是湖南人，站在最前綫討袁的蔡鍔，也是湖南人。</p>
<p>懂得了湖南人的氣質，就懂得戊戍維新運動，梁任公在湖南，一面要受維新派的熱烈歡迎，一面要受守舊派的拼命攻擊了。</p>

<p>當她走進後門時，女厨子看見便問：（你是奶媽嗎？）她小心的回答：（是啦！你嫂子是她家什麽人？）（我是娘姨，將來我們都在一個屋子吃飯了···）女厨子四十歲上下，見了年輕的奶媽，就對待自已女兒一般的親熱起來。（先到厨下去坐一歇罷，太太還不曾起床哩！）女厨子引她到了厨下，她投入陌生的環境中了，正如一尾魚投在泥地上一樣。舉動，眼光都呆笨了，木頭木腦的坐着。不久，就聽到樓上嚶嚶的哭聲，好像被一隻乎扼住了喉嚨那麽的哭。女厨子便掉轉頭來向奶媽說：（就是這個哭的孩子，···世間稀有的多哭的孩子呵···白天好好的，選定晚上來哭，昨夜又哭個不止···）（大概没有奶吃的原故吧。）（太太初生下來二個月，奶很多。）女厨子特意把話轉輕了，帶鼻音的說：（第三個月便又懷了孕啦，···）（爲什麽不早些雇奶媽？）她無所謂的問着。（前個奶媽剛走三天，只有一禮拜便辭掉了。）（爲什麽辭掉她呢？）（·····）女厨子用了個長長的神秘的笑回答了。新來的奶媽站在太太面前。太太腦膜上很深的留下她的印像。一個黑黑的臉，不潔凈的衣服。。耳後，頸上的汚垢，都没有溜過太太銳利的眼光。奶媽的衣襟被命令的解開了，托出那膨脹着的垂下的乳房。太太把孩子放到她的懷里。（試試看，孩子願吃你的奶嗎？）孩子起先啣着乳頭驚奇的注視奶媽的面孔。等到那靑的蚯蚓一般的乳脈動了，乳流進了他的口中，也就一口一口地嚥下去了。（不怕生疏的小東西，有奶便是娘呵！）太太笑了。奶媽也曫起口角微微的笑，她跳過一個關口了。如果孩子只認母親的奶頭，不吃陌生人的奶，也是使做奶媽的十分爲難的事呵。（我們雇了你，孩子就要跟你睡，看你身上衣服太不乾凈，）太太說：（你衣服上有臭蟲嗎？）</p>

<p>軋缺多日之三十五磅薄馬口鐵、其現貨據洋行消息、謂本月中旬將有五百餘箱可到、其價現抛售每箱爲六十元、聞製罐廠等已購去有一百餘箱、</p>

<p>九十磅美馬口鐵、近來市上現貨十分軋缺、而來貨又異常寥少、所以全市呈現貨斷擋之恐慌、標凖因之異常堅硬、計每箱可開至十五元八角、比前漲起二角、况英德諸貨均告軋缺、是以市情益覺挺秀、昨烟廠帮及印刷廠等均有遠期貨（四月份期貨）購進、價格每箱則爲十五元六角、此外九十磅雙連及一百磅單連雙連等貨、均呈平常態度、現市九十磅雙連鐵每箱開三十一元五角、一百磅單連十七元、又雙連估三十四元五角、聞交易因年關迫近、故無甚開出、</p>

<h3 id="c283">思想與力量 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>思想與力量是有相互的關係，而力量的消長又必與思想的表現成爲正比例；這種情形在一個個人的行動上可以看出來，在一羣的民衆行動上，則更可以顯明的看出來。在古今歷史上，一個羣衆從思想的彙集而表現出很大的力量來的，最淸楚的不外乎兩大類：（一）宗敎的：（二）是國家的。雖然這其間往往是有相互因果的作用，但過去許多力量的形成，是發源於宗敎的與國家的兩大思想，却是無可疑義的。至於現在有許多社會學家分析這兩種思想形成的因素，是有許多相同之點，以及歷史上有許多宗敎與國家力量的表現，很多是被少數人利用與羣衆的盲從等等，那均不在本文討論範圍之内。</p>
<p>有思想方有力量，所以思想是力量發生的泉源。古人因地理，印刷等等的阻碍，對於思想的傳播，不如今人的便利，所以一個新思想的成立以及一個舊力量的摧毁，都不是一件容易的事。但今日的情形却不同了，我們將蘇俄的近來的狀况和過去俄國人民文化普遍的落後情形相比較，實在要令人疑爲神蹟了（見史丹林在蘇俄共産黨大會報告文）。其次如意大利棒喝團的成功以及最近一年來德國希特勒獨裁政治的勝利，均爲現代史上有聲有色的表現！幾個言語歷史不同的國家民衆，從一個思想的傳播，很迅速的形成了一種偉大力量的例證。</p>
<p>凡是一種適應大多數羣衆需要的思想，總是可以得着羣衆的信仰與力量，而獲得這種信仰與力量的先决條件，又在領導這思想運動的得人，與運用的得法。蘇俄，意大利與德意志的政治轉變，雖其政治思想完全不同，然其能有目前的成功，則不得不說是由於領導得人，與運用得法。中國近年來民衆力量表現的薄弱，可說已達於極點，卽以抵制日貨而論，從抽象方面看，當然爲一般民衆所贊成的事，而實際上則又與理論相反。何以故呢？因爲抵制日貨雖爲可以號召的一種思想，但因領導無人，運用無法，於是雖至容易形成力量的思想，亦是虚有其名，不得其門而入了！我們看現在中國的一切問題不上軌道，不能産生出一個全國一致的力量，除了思想本身的問題而外，這缺乏領導思想的人與運用思想的方法，也實在是値得我們注意的一個重要問題。</p>
<h3 id="c284">生活我們民族中的小鬼 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 杰</p>
<p>假使你走過某處郵政管理局的大門時，你定會看見有一羣像乞丐樣的人們在聚着，蓬首垢面，鶉衣百結，活像鬼門關内放出來的一羣小鬼。不過，你雖然時常看見這一羣小鬼，但也許你從没有注意到小鬼們的生活。　　你别輕視了這一羣小鬼，他們是我們民族中最堅苦耐勞最健全優秀的國民，但他們的生活永遠是在水平綫以下。我也曾見過有幾個在大雪中凍死在階沿上，而被慈善機關抬去掩埋的。</p>
<p>事實是這樣：郵局在工作緊張的時候，例如有遠洋輪船到滬或離滬，就有大批郵件需要搬運，這時候就在門外招一批臨時勞工去搬運郵件。近年以來，交通頻繁，郵件日增，於是所需要的臨時勞工也格外多，每日常有一百左右的人數。工作時間不一定、短至一小　二小時，但亦間有全日者，都視事的繁忙程度而定。他們的報酬，是計時的，而且是現付的，每小時小洋一角。郵局方面，以其價廉，亦樂得將一切重力工作交付他們，這樣比招收一批永久的勞工要便宜得多，而且呼之則來，揮之則去，有事則出錢雇用，無事則可以置之不理，又没有罷工的危險，這也許很合於科學管理的原理罷！</p>
<p>中國工業不興，而農村又頻於破産，失業的人就日益增多，於是在郵局前等着工做的人也太多了，所以郵局所需要的臨時雇工，也發生了人浮於事，粥少僧多的現象。假使某時郵局須雇臨時勞工十人，就有一個郵局職員，站在高處，拿了十個紙條，向地下一擲，而下面一羣小鬼似的苦工則互相爭奪着，誰力氣大，搶着了紙條，就可以做幾小時的工。年老力衰的當然輪不到他，只得垂頭喪氣望着别人做工。　　但年輕力壯搶着了紙條的，並不一定就可以圖溫飽。假使每天搶着五小時的工做，他就可以有吃，有棧房住，維持一天最低限度的生活。但假使一天搶不到工做，或只做了一二小時，那就只可挨餓忍寒，宿在弄堂角裏。尤其是星期日和假日，郵局照例休息，無工可做，但肚子却不肯休息，没有吃，就要職。所以在國歷新年，郵局連放了四天假，使他們四天没有工做，這簡直置他們於死地。然而在這舉國歡騰的新年中，正是公子哥兒們伴着姐兒們優游逍遙之時，誰又會念到這一羣小鬼在風雪之中忍饑呢？可是，他們正是我們民族中最堅苦耐勞，優秀健全的國民啊！</p>
<h3 id="c285">職業譚數正當職業的標準 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<p>（某某不務正業），這是人們慣於用來批評那些没有所謂正當職業的人的常套語。但是，甚麽纔能算作正當職業？在今日的人們心目中是没有一定標凖的。比如說·做官的職業，不但社會上的人都把牠視爲是正當職業，而且還被人視爲是最光榮高貴的職業。然而我們細心研究起來，有許多做官的人的心理，不過是在以發財與提高自已的生活及地位爲目的，這不但不能算正當職業，而且還不能說是一種職業。至於一般貪官汚吏，專門以刮地皮剥削他人爲能事，這種行徑，如果也呌做正當職業，那就眞寃枉極了！</p>
<p>如果說正當職業的解釋，就是說以個人爲出發點，只要他是以自已的肉體和精神的勞力去換取報酬，這在他算是没有坐食别人的血汗，就算有了正當職業，那麽一般下流社會的遊方賣技者，一樣也出了他的演技的勞力的。賣打的人身上都打靑了，才摸得幾個錢，難道這不是以他的肉體和勞力去換取報酬嗎？不但那些遊方賣技者，就是娼妓的婦女，她忍辱受恥，犧牲自已的肉體去摸幾個錢來過活，這又不是以肉體和精神的勞力去換取報酬的正當職業嗎？然而人們却又說遊方賣技者，賣淫的婦女們，其所事都不是正當職業。　　這樣說來，所謂正當職業的評價，一定要有一個標凖，否則我們無法呌人都去作正當職業。可是，在現社會裏所定的正當職業的凖備是不妥當的，因爲大家都是在以個人爲中心，以爲凡是一個人能以自已的勞力代價去謀得個人生活的滿足，就算有了正當職業。其實我們評論某種職業是否正當，　　對於人　社會進化是否有利，要看牠是否能成爲社會的生産勞働的一部分分工。合乎這兩個前提的，我們可以呌牠做正當職業，反之卽不能算是正當職業。</p>
<p>因爲如此，所以我們便容易分别出那些職業是正當的，那些職業是不正當的；而且在同一職業中也能分别出有的是正當的，有的是不正當的。比如說當官吏這種職業，如果依照上述的凖備，不但作貪官汚吏不是正當的職業，就是參加在一切阻碍社會進化的組織中，担任阻碍社會進化的工作，都不能算是正當職業。反之在一種能促進社會進化的社會組織下勞作，盡其促進社會進化和社會生産發達的功用，却能算是正當的。工人從事生産，醫師，敎授，文豪，藝術家，只要他是站在進步的方面，能够推動社會和其生産事業前進，便都能稱爲担任了正當的分工之一種的職業。在這樣的意義下，遊方賣技的人，賣淫的娼妓等，當然其職業都是不正當的。我們希望社會能予人人以正當職業，我們也希望社會上的人，個個不至被迫去作不正當的職業。</p>
<h3 id="c286">小小專著對有色人種歧視的原因 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 忍</p>
<p>在非洲南部，在自名爲文明之邦的帝國主義所統治下的殖民地中，我們可以看到許多怪誕的現象。那些自視爲優秀種族的白種人士，不遺餘力地中傷侮辱有色人種：譬如在旅行時，黑人祗能乘坐在隔離的車輛中，他們不能走進學校戲院，甚至連乘電車及在走道中行走的權利都没有，因爲在白人心目中，黑人簡實没有資格配稱爲人。</p>
<p>在德國刑法上，更載上這樣一條條文：（凡德國國民與有色人種發生肉體關係者，國家認爲此種行爲實爲叛反種族，舉行婚姻之當事人均須受處罰。）在民法上而論這種婚姻是無效的，依德國立法者看來，這種與有色人種婚姻之舉，有碍優秀民族之發達，及抵觸德意志民族之光榮。因爲全部的理由是：在德意志人民心目中，這些有色人種簡直没有資格配稱爲人。</p>
<p>爲什麽白種人對有色人種存有這種歧視呢？對於這個問題，發生幾種不同的解答：</p>
<p>（一）這一派以爲對有色人種的歧視的源泉，在於個人與集團自存之需要的表示中，所以要反對有色人種移民及與有色人種配合。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>（二）這一派認為這些行為都含有性的意味，他們說明了白種婦女愛好有色人種，所以白人感到一種嫉妬，這就是歧視的由來。</p>
<p>（三）這一派一方面對種族間互相仇視表示遺憾，但一方面卻認為優秀民族有培養低劣民族的義務。</p>
<p>第一派是站在祖國帝國主義的童言立場上來闡明歧視有色人種的利害觀，他們說明要鞏固及維持本國資本家及一部分白種工人的利益起見，非嚴酷地剝削有色人種不可。基于這種政策，乃極力宣傳有色人種的兇暴無能等等的謠言。有非洲，黑人的工資每星期為十五先令，白種工人則每星期為八金磅。但自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌爆發後，白人及黑人均受到重大的影響，黑人的命運固然悲慘，白人失業者變屬不少。他們四處找求工作，可是因為黑人勞動代價的低微，發生了可怕的競爭，白人的確受到不少的威脅，於是更擴大了種族間的歧視的鴻溝。英國的工黨就是代表這種白種工人的利益的政黨，它實佈了禁止黑人躍為標別工人的決議案，可是有許多白種工人，他們卻感到與黑種工人具有同樣悲慘的命運。第二派企圖用性的關系來解釋這種社會現象，但這種企圖顯然是失敗了。性，譬如是鏈子中的一環，但不是主要的一環。主要的一環是一種經濟關系，這種經濟的基礎是說明上層建筑的要緊。我們現在姑且承認白種婦女愛好有色人種的現象是存在的，但至少不應該用性的關系來說明它，我們應該用很復雜的原因，主要的當然是經濟的原因來說明它。這個理由是自明的，因為白種婦女與有色人種結婚者究屬不多，要引起白種人的嫉妬與懷恨顯然是不可能的。</p>
<p>第三派以為白種人應該將有色人種的文化提高，又以為文化程度之高低這於需要的多寡，所以為增加他們的需要便努力地將商品推銷。這種論調是很矛盾的，因為商品傾銷的結果，有色人種不可避免地要破產，破產以後，他們低價的勞動給白人以極大的威脅，於是又引起敵視。所以這種論調也是不能自圓其說的。</p>
<p>歸納上述，我們即可知道，這種歧視有色人種的由來，並還是別的，而是由生產方式所決定的。</p>

<h3 id="c287">提倡國貨與復興農村 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 冬嗚</p>
<p>誰都知道，中國是以農立國的國家。在全國人口中農民佔最大多數，農村是最大的消費塲所，也是最大的生産地方。如果我們的農業生産很發達，在農村中所消費的生産品都是我們自已的國貨，那我們的整個産業便必然會要發達起來，因而國家的地位也就絕不會像目前這個樣子了。</p>
<p>但是，不幸得很，我們的農村是帝國主義廣大的原料培植地，是其傾銷商品的大市塲。在帝國主義的魔力控制之下，我們的農村經濟旣不能保存舊有的形態，又不能走上新的道路，而必然地陷於破産的危機中。近年以來，因爲各種天災人禍的結果，我們的農村經濟更是破産無餘。農業生産率的下降，農村購買力的减少，便是目前中國農村的眞實現象。</p>
<p>農業生産率的下降，使帝國主義的農産品大批地傾銷到中國來，以吸收我們的現金；農村購買力的减少，使都市的工業品失掉了廣大的市塲，不能發展；｜｜這便是中國産業凋敝，一切都陷於窮困中的主要原因之一。　　人們提倡國貨，只看到城市，没有看到農村。只知道帝國主義的商品在城市中暢銷有碍於國貨的發展，却不曉得他們的洋布，洋油，洋米···等之傾銷於農村中也是阻碍國貨發展的。所以從去年的（國貨年）到今年的（婦女國貨年），無論是（爺兒們）或（孃兒們）都没有幹好，結果是全上海的絲廠一齊倒閉，織綢廠大批地歇業，洋米輸入一千六七百萬担，入超八九萬萬元！</p>
<p>我以爲不言提倡國貨則已，要講提倡國貨，便非復興農村經濟不可。提倡國貨的意義，應該是而且必然是：復興工業與農業，繁勞都市和鄕村。倘然我們放開鄕村不管，只守在城市裏提倡國貨，天天駡摩登婦女，那將不會有什麽前途！</p>
<p>同時，更主要的，還應該積極地起來解除帝國主義對我們的一切經濟的政治的束縛。如果不像這樣而只是避實就虚地提倡國貨，高呌着什麽（改變人心），那也是没有前途的。因爲帝國主義不僅可以利用我們的關稅不自主以傾銷其商品，而且還在我們内地來開工廠鑛山，經營航業，設立租界···。我們的整個經濟生命都被握在帝國主義的掌中了；若果我們不努力用積極的辦法拚命從其掌中衝出來，而幻想和平地在其掌中生長發育，那不是在做夢嗎？</p>

<p>— 賜安</p>
<p>上星期日我們爲徵求幾位廣告同事曾經託由本刊向失業的朋友作個轉達，跟着第二天就有十幾封應徵的信，第三第四等日，仍然陸續還有信來。</p>
<p>在最初我們不過是想找幾位朋友來帮忙，却承編輯先生把上期義務廣告加上了一個（佣金合理化）的題目，惹得許多人要問個明白，甚至有兩家廣告公司的現任職員，也來詢問；當然，他們不是來應徵，而是想問明辦法的。</p>
<p>現在，我們就借本刊補白地位作個解答。</p>
<p>大報館的廣告方面服務的人員多半是按月支薪，和其他各部的職員待遇，没有兩樣。大規模的廣告公司，廣告員也支有薪水，另外再支佣金。其次便只有佣金及車資，不支薪水。我們現在連車資都貼不起，所以只能靠佣金。平常佣金都是一律辦法，卽三成就算三成，二成就只二成：你努力也好，不做也好，反正一律是幾成就是幾成，廣告拉得多是絲毫没有獎勵的。</p>
<p>我們現在規定佣金的成數要隨着廣告量數增長，以便努力的人格外再有酬報。簡單來說，就是：（一）每人每月經手廣告費總數在五百元以下時，佣金只有二成，（二）超過五百元未滿一千元時佣金卽按二成五計算，（三）超過一千元未滿二千元時，三成佣金，（四）二千元以上一律按三成五計算。此外，凡廣告員進來都要訂三個月試辦合同，滿三個月後，假如雙方滿意，再延長期間。</p>
<p>截至寫稿時止，我們所接到的信多半是剛剛離開或是要離開學校的同學們。但是我們深怕同學們弄不慣這種廣告員的生活，因爲出門找生意，步步要求人，要靠人，要奉迎人，最後或許還要受人家的奚落。可是我們對同學們仍是極端歡迎；只要個人有勇氣，有毅力，有，有口才應付闊人或神氣十足的大班們的本領，也一定能够勝任愉快的。否則報社雖然管得起吃住，然而白白消磨靑年人的時間，我們也是認爲可惜的。</p>
<p>假如還有朋友們想嘗試嘗試，儘管照舊寫信來商議，因爲我們確實需要廣告員。</p>
<p>來信請直接寄交漢口路太平坊市民報社廣告部收，不必再請狄先生收轉，免多費手續。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Son prepares to step down <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored here this morning that Sun Dianying has telegraphed the Central Government, preparing to step down and requesting the dispatch of personnel to take over his troops. It is said that the government has sent two air squadrons to assist Ma's battle against Sun. Mongolian circles say that Sun's army is on the verge of defeat and the war may end soon. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Sun Dianying at Dengkou <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain Councilor Lu from the 41st Army, who came from Baotou, said that Sun Dianying is currently at Dengkou. Lu Fengnian's division and Xie's brigade, under Sun's command stationed at Wuyuan, have reinforced westward. The Ning army defending the city consists of about 20,000 men. Sun's troops near Ningxia number about 30,000, forming an encirclement around Ningxia. All of Sun's troops at Wulin have moved west. Casualties on both sides are considerable. If there is no proper solution, a major war may still be unavoidable. (3rd Special dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Central Government warns Sun by telegram <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government has issued a clear order dismissing Sun Dianying from his position as the Qinghai-Ningxia Reclamation Commissioner. If he continues to advance westward against orders, decisive action will be taken. A telegram has been sent to He in Beiping to handle the matter accordingly, and a severe warning has been sent to Sun, ordering him to immediately comply with the order to retreat to Dengkou, reorganize into one division according to the established plan, designate a location for training, and disband all recruited stragglers and bandits. Otherwise, the entire force will be dealt with. (3rd Special dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Song decides to mediate <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun and Ma's troops are still in fierce battle. The provincial capital of Ningxia is still surrounded by Sun's troops, who also occupy various outposts in the suburbs, taking a defensive posture. The Ningxia army is holding firm in the city and will switch to an offensive. Ma telegraphed Beiping last night, stating that enemy troops in the suburbs of the provincial capital are still stubbornly refusing to retreat and that troops are being dispatched to clear them out. It is said that the authorities have decided to handle the matter according to the central government's plan, ordering Sun's troops to withdraw quickly and station themselves in the Wuyuan and Linhe area. The plan to send personnel to meet with Sun has been abandoned, as Men Bingyue had already been sent. If Sun is sincere, he can negotiate with Men nearby, so there is no need to send anyone else. It is said that Song has decided to step forward to mediate, with Song's representative first discussing a mediation plan with the representatives of both sides in Beiping. After the plan is agreed upon, it will be reported to Song, who will then contact Sun and Ma. Song originally intended to inspect the counties of Hebei province, but the heavy snow in Zhangjiakou has made transportation difficult, so the trip has been postponed. Song is scheduled to come to Beiping on the 9th and 10th of this month. (3rd Special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed Kang Shishu, his representative in Jin, to explain the true situation of the military at the front to Jin authorities. Sun has been unable to conquer Ningxia for a long time, and his supplies are lacking. He recently sent two telegrams to Zhang Guanwu, who had previously been working to mediate, requesting him to seek a way out from He. He is willing to comply with the order to withdraw and requests the dispatch of personnel to monitor. He finally stated that he is in a dilemma under the current circumstances. Zhang replied to Sun, advising him to obey He's order to withdraw troops, and saying that even if he were to conquer Ningxia, it would only be a temporary stroke of luck and would not last long. Zhang arrived in Beiping last night to visit He. Zhang has contacted Song's representative in Beiping and is negotiating with Sun and Ma's representatives in Beiping, Wang Shouxin and Bai Jianmin. He has telegraphed Hu Jiesan in Tianjin to come to Beiping to discuss the first steps. After the principles are agreed upon, they will proceed separately. Han is also concerned about the Sun-Ma war. He has sent Liu Xizhong as his representative to Beiping, which is related to the peace movement. (3rd Special dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Sun's troops defend fortresses <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed that after Sun's troops occupied Shizuizi Mountain, their Zhuansun Brigade attacked Pingluo and was repelled, suffering over a thousand casualties. Yang Ganqing's brigade and others launched fierce attacks on the Tongcheng and Ligang fortress positions, but were also repelled, with corpses piling up. Their cavalry in the Tongji and Tongyi area also failed. Unable to succeed with multiple attacks, the enemy launched a full-scale attack on Ningyuan on the 15th, but were surrounded. The enemy panicked and attempted to break through, resulting in two days and nights of fierce fighting, killing many enemies and capturing nearly a thousand prisoners. The enemy fled to various fortresses, shutting themselves in and defending to the death. Defeated soldiers looted everywhere, plundering livestock and grain, and confiscating opium and property. The people died of cold and starvation, in a very miserable state. Furthermore, Sun's 19th Division is advancing from Baotou, and its supplies are still being transported.

<p>(Beiping) Military News: It is said that Zuo Yi telegraphed, reporting on the situation of Sun's army's attack. Sun's 118th Division is now concentrated in the northwest of Ningyuan, attacking the Baliqiao Xiegang fortress outside the north gate, but Xiegang fortress has still not been captured.

<p>(Beiping) Military News: Zhu Shaoliang telegraphed, saying that according to Ma Bufang's report on the 24th, Sun's military plan was seized: (1) The main point of attack in the first stage is to occupy Shizuizi first, making it easier for our main army to advance in multiple directions, and we can take advantage of the victory to go south, avoiding our army's stagnation in the wilderness. (2) The main point of attack in the second stage is Pingluo City, which should be attacked in two routes. The central route should directly attack the left and right sides of the Great Wall, and should use encirclement tactics, first to cut off its reinforcements, to chill its courage, so that the central route can easily succeed. The second attack on Ningxia will break Pingluo without encirclement. Our senior commanders must break through Ningxia in the shortest period. (3) The main point of the third stage is to use all our strength to defeat the enemy's cavalry, and then occupy Guangwuzhen and Zhongwei, so as to directly attack Gansu, and try to capture the rebel Ma Hongkui alive. Although our army's plan is clearly divided, it is actually one unified plan. All our generals must judge clearly and achieve a coordinated effect. (3rd Special dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Western invasion of Sun Dianying's troops, all parties have earnestly advised and the military authorities here have repeatedly telegraphed to stop them, but to no avail. In addition to fiercely attacking Ningxia, Sun has ignored everything else. As a result, the war on the Ningxia border is gradually expanding. According to someone from a related party, the Central Government and the North China military authorities are still being lenient to Sun, hoping that he will realize his mistakes soon. Although the disposal plan has been roughly decided, the final decision will depend on whether Sun obeys orders. The authorities here have reported the truth of the incident to the Central Government for reference, and will follow the Central Government's orders on how to deal with it. Sun recently telegraphed to Beiping to inquire whether military pay would be stopped, and asked to send personnel to monitor the withdrawal, which is unfounded. According to inquiries, the military pay of Sun's troops is still being allocated by the Military Affairs Commission as usual, and the treatment is better than that of other troops. Sun is suspicious of himself and is trying to use this as an excuse to advance westward, which is suspected of coercion. There is no need to send personnel to monitor. If Sun obeys the order to withdraw and implements downsizing, all disputes can be resolved and his actions will be trusted. Otherwise, if he relies on strength and resists stubbornly, sending personnel to monitor will not help. If Sun disregards the law and acts recklessly, the Central Government will only have to take effective sanctions to rectify discipline and maintain security in the Northwest. It was heard last month that when Hou Cheng went to Jin to visit Yan, Yan expressed the hope that the matter would not be further expanded, and sent personnel to advise Sun to obey the order to stop advancing westward, and had no preconceived ideas about the disposal plan. Everything that is being carried out here is supported. Hou went to Baoding a few days ago and is currently sorting out personal matters. He will go to Beiping in about three to five days before going to Jin for further consultation. Liu Jianqun, Director of the Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission, went south yesterday under orders to visit Chairman Jiang and report on the recent military and political situation in North China. He also sought instructions on how to deal with the Sun-Ma conflict. (3rd Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

The Lianyungang project has been completed by one-third and can also be completed by the end of this year. The funds used are collected by the Railway Department, the banking sector, and the business community, and the purpose is to complete its construction as soon as possible, because the development of the Northwest requires convenient transportation. Although the Longhai Railway is barren and poor, its products are quite rich. At present, due to the lack of vehicles, a large amount of goods is piled up along the stations and cannot be transported as much as possible. Therefore, the railway business has no surplus. This is all due to transportation. He is determined to do his best to promote its development in the future.

<h3 id="e19">China's Food Problem Ting <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>China is facing a food crisis. Famines occur from time to time. Small farmers work hard. It is not that they are not diligent. But a good harvest is only enough to provide food and clothing. A bad year will inevitably lead to starvation. Young and strong people have no choice but to take risks and become bandits. (Food is the paramount necessity of the people). If the food problem is not solved, there will be no stability for the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>The Rural Reconstruction Committee organized by the Executive Yuan of the National Government has long regarded the regulation of food as one of its four major plan items. Recently, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the four committee members Liu Zhi, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, and Zhou Qigang proposed to control the national food supply to promote rural revitalization. The outline of the proposed measures has been approved by the 393rd Central Political Conference a few days ago and transferred to the National Economic Commission. All of this is a sign that the authorities are concerned about the people's food. The long-standing complex food problem may have a glimmer of hope for a considerable solution.</p>
<p>The food problem arises primarily because production and consumption cannot be properly coordinated. If production is low and consumption is high, there is a risk of food shortages. Conversely, there is the burden of food surpluses. It is well known that China is suffering from food shortages today. The remedy should focus on increasing production and reducing consumption. Therefore, I will briefly describe what I have seen and heard below.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Increase Production <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>First, expand the area of cultivated land. There are three ways to do this: (A) Strictly prohibit the planting of tobacco seedlings. Local military warlords are entrenched in one side and value their own soldiers. Planting tobacco is profitable. The practice of planting tobacco is especially common in the provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Henan, Shaanxi, Fujian, and Guangdong. It not only occupies useful land, but also wastes labor and capital. The growth period of tobacco seedlings also directly conflicts with beans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. Both cannot be obtained. When poppies flourish, the harvest of miscellaneous grains will naturally decrease. (B) Break the custom of burial. Chinese society values ​​patriarchal law. Burying parents is the responsibility of children. Wealthy families build tombs and plant trees that occupy even more land. The more fertile the land and the more dense the population, the more dead people are buried there. Land is limited, and there is no end to burial. Fertile land and good soil are decreasing day by day. (C) Reclaim wasteland in border areas. China's border areas, such as the three northeastern provinces, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Ningxia, and Qinghai, all have vast grasslands that are lush and dense, stretching for thousands of miles. Except for a small part where wheat and millet are planted, the land has not been cultivated. It is a great pity. If we can immigrate and colonize the border, or station troops to cultivate the land, it will not only adjust the surplus population of the mainland, but also help national defense and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Second, encourage the planting of rice and wheat. People in southern China eat rice, and people in northern China like noodles. Wheat is the raw material for noodles. In recent years, imperialists have intensified their economic aggression against China. The massive import of foreign rice and wheat has made the rural economy disintegrate. Domestic farmers, who are poor, often plant tobacco and other crops for the sake of profit. Rice paddies and wheat fields have been relatively reduced. For example, the fine tobacco produced in the three provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Anhui reaches 150 million pounds a year. The annual income of farmers is about 30 million yuan. It is not surprising that people tend to pursue profit like water flows downward.</p>
<p>Third, utilize human capital. China suffers from the disturbance of soldiers and bandits, which affects farming. Soldiers and bandits are mostly young and strong farmers who have become destroyers. How great is the loss to the country when millions of productive members are turned into destroyers? The lack of capital is due to the people's livelihood difficulties. However, if the politics are clear and the society is stable, the national capital will not be concentrated in a few commercial cities under the protection of imperialists, thereby creating a phenomenon of financial freezing in the interior.</p>
<p>Fourth, improve agricultural technology. This point is clear and easy to understand, so there is no need to repeat it.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Reduce Consumption <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>First, limit population growth. The density of China's population in proportion to land area is not very high. However, because the distribution is not appropriate and the people's production efficiency is too low, there is a population burden. There are natural and artificial differences in limiting population growth. The former is driven by natural forces and is cruel and inhumane. The latter, except for war, should be studied by civilized countries.</p>
<p>Second, control food waste. Chinese people have always held a polyphagous doctrine. The banquets of wealthy families are even more extravagant. The amount of glutinous rice and sorghum consumed in winemaking is already alarming. We should study ways to save and make up for the lack of food for the people.</p>
<p>However, as the proposal of the four committee members Liu, Zhu, Chen, and Zhou said, this is a major matter. (Without national planning, central consultation, an overall management system, measures that are meticulous and appropriate, and grand plans that are not successful), it requires the joint efforts of people from all walks of life. Otherwise, if a famine strikes and there are corpses everywhere, it will be too late to talk about the way to provide relief. Digging a well when thirsty is laborious but useless.</p>

<p>Sun Shutang's negotiations with the Japanese army</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, it was discovered in Miyun that soldiers of the Rehe Border Self-Defense Corps and puppet troops were wearing military uniforms and carrying weapons to enter the border to escort contraband. County magistrate Sun Shutang was afraid of accidents. On the 29th of last month, he personally led Xu Shiying, the captain of the security team, Zhang Boran, the president of the Shixia Chamber of Commerce, and Guo Mingyun, the chief of the public security branch, to Gubeikou to visit the Japanese military officer. Hayakawa Masashi, the commander of the Japanese 31st Regiment, and Motofuji, the chief of the military police station, held a banquet to entertain them. After the meeting, Sun raised the issue of negotiations. The result was satisfactory. It was decided that both sides would abide by the spirit of the armistice agreement and would not allow them to carry weapons to the war zone. If there is any official business, they must have a formal passport from the county government, which must be stamped by the Japanese consul to be valid. After the negotiations, Sun and others left Gubeikou early on the 31st to inspect Shixia Town and arrived in Miyun on the 1st of this month. (3rd Special dispatch)</p>

<p>The Military Disarmament Situation is Chaotic</p>
<p>Roosevelt Temporarily Takes a Back Seat</p>
<p>France No Longer Recognizes Disarmament</p>
<p>Britain Plans to Send Someone to Europe to Mediate</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt is currently not commenting on various disarmament proposals. He will only express his opinions when the situation moves away from the scope of European politics and enters the international stage. Today, the White House repeatedly stated that President Roosevelt does not want to be involved in European politics. At the same time, Davis, the former US representative to the disarmament conference, does not want to return to Geneva until the date of the disarmament conference is confirmed.

<p>(London) Yesterday, government officials declared that the Lord Privy Seal, Eden, has long had plans to travel to various European capitals.

<p>(Paris) The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting to discuss the armament memorandums of France, Britain, Germany, and Italy. Chairman Beranger analyzed them one by one, making a comparative study. The committee members debated meticulously on the following issues: (1) Equal rights to armaments, (2) Automatic armament inspection system, (3) Trial period, (4) Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, namely the provisions concerning the demilitarization of the left bank of the Rhine River. After the debate, all committee members believed that, under the current circumstances, France could no longer recognize reducing the number of French troops. They decided to follow the agenda set by the Senate, advocating the strict organization of national defense, establishing international peace organizations with effective methods, consolidating security, and consolidating France's relations with various allied countries, especially focusing on the relationship between Britain and France. This agenda was decided by the Senate after the current Prime Minister Doumergue made a declaration in the Senate. Subsequently, Chairman Beranger reported on his recent visit to England and some other news related to the German-Austrian issue. This news was divided into two types: (1) The relationship between Austria and other countries, (2) The views of various countries on the issue of the union between Germany and Austria. The committee then entrusted the chairman to inform Prime Minister Daladier of the consensus expressed at today's meeting and requested the Prime Minister to attend the committee to respond to the issues raised today. Finally, the committee entrusted Congressman Cabus to study the Franco-Russian commercial treaty and to review the bill on the annex to the Franco-German commercial treaty submitted by the government to the Senate and submit a report.

<h3 id="e27">German Reply Published in French <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Entire French Proposal Overturned</p>
<p>(Berlin) The French disarmament memorandum was published on February 1st, and the German reply of January 19th was also published today. It stated that the main points of the French plan raised serious doubts as to whether this method of dealing with the disarmament issue was based on fairness and peace. What Germany opposes most is (1) France's proposal regarding war equipment, which would delay disarmament for several years. If countries with abundant armaments only undertake not to prepare new offensive war equipment, while Germany is restricted by the insufficient war equipment permitted by the Treaty of Versailles, this is not a way to ensure security. (2) The issue of military strength cannot be ascertained until France's proposals regarding overseas troops, such as African troops, are known. (3) If Germany is not allowed to have an air force, then even if other countries reduce their air forces, it cannot change the fundamentally unequal fact of Germany. (4) The management methods proposed by France are unfair because they are different for disarmed countries and armed countries. (5) The most crucial question now is whether discrimination against Germany should be extended for several more years, and whether other countries consider plans that are incompatible with Germany's honor and security to be reasonable.

<p>Vienna. Tens of thousands of farmers in southern Austria marched in Vienna today to express their support for the Dollfuss government. The demonstrators carried flags with slogans such as "Long Live Dollfuss" and "Austrian Freedom and Peace." They passed through the main streets to their meeting place. Dollfuss attended the meeting and gave a public speech, saying that he would take measures to curb Germany's promotion of the terrorism of the National Socialist Party and urged all sectors to work together to build a completely free Austria. (2nd Reuters Telegram) Vienna. Farmers in Lower Austria held a demonstration. Prime Minister Dollfuss attended the event and delivered a speech describing the political and economic situation of Austria and the current stage of the conflict between Germany and Austria. His speech was very long. Dollfuss said that Germany supplied weapons to the terrorists of the Austrian National Socialist Party, and the German National Socialist Party also made various speeches, intending to provoke unrest, so that the Hitler Party caused great disturbances in Austria. Dollfuss said, "We have advised the German government with an extremely calm attitude, asking it to stop this kind of behavior, but it was ultimately ineffective. Our last experiment was also unsuccessful. Austria believes that it has the right to self-defense. We will work hard to bear the obligations that we should fulfill. We are fighting for the honor and freedom of Austria. The Austrian people are all for the Disarmament Conference Second Anniversary</p>

<p>(Geneva) Yesterday was the second anniversary of the establishment of the World Disarmament Conference. According to the League of Nations report, the total expenditure for this conference was approximately 350,000 yuan, but the military expenditure of all countries in the world is 5,000,000,000 yuan. The expenses of the Disarmament Conference are drawn from a portion of the expenses paid by various countries to maintain the representatives of the League of Nations. The cost of maintaining the representatives in Geneva is very high. The hotel fees alone are 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per year. The chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, receives a daily living allowance of 150 francs in Geneva. In addition, there are representative fees. In total, Henderson has received more than 21,000 yuan from the League of Nations. Since the official establishment of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference on February 2, 1932, a total of 920 meetings, large and small, have been held, including 81 large meetings, and only 18 plenary sessions.

<p>German nation. You farmers are especially the root of the Germanic nation, and it has always been so, and it will always be so from now on. However, our view of Germanism is different from that of the National Socialist Party. We cannot recognize the (coercive) actions of the German National Socialist Party as conforming to the spirit of the Germanic nation. We know that we will reform Austrian politics, but the form of reform is the form of Austria, and it is a form that conforms to culture. Germans often say that if the Austrian people are allowed to freely express their opinions, then all the people will support National Socialism. Those who say this should come here to take a look. No less than 100,000 farmers in Lower Austria have gathered here today, and they all express their support for the current government. In other words, it is a kind of referendum. Your presence here today is a clear evidence that is more than enough to refute the German people's lies. And your expression is like a loud cry, not only can it be heard everywhere in the country, but it can also be heard outside the borders." Dollfuss concluded by saying that the Austrian farmers' preparation to protect their freedom and independence for the Germanic nation is the bulwark of the Austrian government.

<p>Friendship Agreement Established Among Cabinet Members</p>
<p>Continue to Govern Until 1936</p>
<p>(London) According to the News Chronicle, the organ of the Liberal Party, British cabinet members have recently concluded a friendship agreement. According to the agreement, the National Government will continue to govern until the budget for 1936 is passed. In that case, it is expected that a general election will not be held before the autumn of 1935. It is reported that this agreement was signed after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Its intention seems to be to avoid criticism from some important people of Prime Minister MacDonald. Recently, many conservative party leaders have criticized Prime Minister MacDonald's policies. Now that this measure has been taken, the cabinet can form a united front. When the parliament discusses the Indian issue and the disarmament issue in the future, the government will not encounter any difficulties. And the government is now drafting industrial legislation. Regarding these drafts, the government can also continue its consistent policy. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>New Government Meets with Parliament</p>
<p>People's Hearts are Tense, What Will Happen Afterwards?</p>
<p>(Paris) Daladier's second government will meet with the parliament tomorrow, and the atmosphere is suddenly tense. No one is satisfied with the new government. Daladier is probably especially aware of this, because Daladier originally expected to form a government of young people with blood and vigor, but now he feels that he is shackled by political party conspiracies and suspicions, and he is no different from a prisoner under the power of political parties. At present, the political alliances and horizontal links in the Chamber of Deputies have reached the point of exhaustion, and the possibility of Daladier's failure to win a vote of confidence tomorrow has raised the question of "what will happen afterwards." The Socialist Party has announced its determination to oppose Daladier, but it is also determined to resist the dissolution of the parliament. The tension in people's hearts is caused by various rumors. The remarks published by the Ordre newspaper can be seen as a sign of tension. It said, "We hope that Daladier's strength is enough to stop the mob from continuing to interfere with the government." Daladier is determined to thoroughly clarify the parliamentary government, but the New Socialist Party and the Right Party are all prepared to resist, so it is truly incredible if Daladier can obtain a vote of confidence in the parliament tomorrow.

<p>Can Greece and Bulgaria Compromise?</p>
<p>Key to the Success or Failure of the Balkan Pact</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Four Countries Meet in the Capital of Yugoslavia</p>
<p>The Main Purpose is to Establish a Line to Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>Not Much Hope if Bulgaria Does Not Join. (London) The diplomatic authorities of Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Romania are meeting in Belgrade today, hoping to eliminate the final difficulties and establish the Balkan Pact. Therefore, the eyes of the European political world are now focused on the capital of Yugoslavia. The greatest purpose of this meeting is to promote economic and political cooperation, and it is especially important to oppose attempts to revise the Treaty of Versailles and establish an entire front. However, any Balkan pact will be meaningless without the participation of Bulgaria. Therefore, Bulgaria is the cornerstone of the entire Balkan structure. Bulgaria yesterday still stated that it was unwilling to join the meeting if some of its demands were rejected.</p>
<p>What Bulgaria demands is (1) that the Bulgarian minorities in neighboring countries should enjoy freedom of education, religion, and language; (2) equality of armaments; (3) land access to the Aegean Sea. According to Bulgaria, this access to the sea was promised by the Treaty of Neuilly. However, Greece is unwilling to give this corridor to Bulgaria, because giving this land to others will cause Greece to lose one of the richest provinces in tobacco production. There is another matter that is also an obstacle to the Balkan Pact.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia now attaches great importance to friendship with Bulgaria and is unwilling to sign a pact that would offend Bulgaria. But on the optimistic side, the King of Bulgaria recently visited Romania and Yugoslavia, which has been quite effective in terms of diplomatic relations. The King of Bulgaria and the King of Yugoslavia are both talented monarchs who are supported by their people. Therefore, although the diplomatic meeting that begins today may only produce results in finding solutions, what politicians cannot do, the King may be able to do, to create a new force in the world of one hundred million people.

<p>The Right Wing Uses Patriotism to Plan Revolution</p>
<p>Should Be Banned in the Same Way as the Communist Party</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives met at 1:13 PM today. The speaker changed the agenda, and Kato Taiichi of the National League raised an emergency question, saying, "The Saito Cabinet believes that the amendment to the election law, which is an important mission, has only requested the Emperor to consult the Privy Council today, after one-third of the session has passed. There is no greater negligence of the national situation than this. Does the government have any intention of submitting it to the parliament?" Prime Minister Saito replied,</p>
<p>"The government is rushing to prepare to submit it to the parliament for discussion." Next, the agenda proceeded according to the schedule. The government submitted the amendment to the Public Security Preservation Law. Minister of Justice Oyama explained the reasons for the proposal. Then, Takami, a member of the Seiyukai, took the stage to question, "We have no objection to the government's decisive punishment of those who doubt the Japanese national polity. For those who are redified due to economic difficulties, the government can severely crack down on them with social policy guidelines. But what kind of countermeasures does the government have for those who only share pure theories and participate in the Communist Party?"</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Oyama replied, "For those who theoretically believe in communism, it is possible to show a higher theory and teach them a lesson, hoping that they will change their direction. The judicial authorities will continue to work hard in this direction. Those who change their direction will have their prosecution postponed." After Kobayashi Aya of the Seiyukai and Hiza Shohei of the Minseito questioned, Kuyama Funeo of the Seiyukai took the stage to question, saying, "The extreme right-wing movement, which has been vigorously implemented recently, uses the name of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism to proceed towards the same goal as the Communist Party. What kind of measures does the Minister of Justice have for those who use violence to plan a revolution in this way? Does he have the intention to severely suppress them?" Minister of Justice Oyama replied, "The authorities are not only working hard to arrest the Communist Party, but also the right-wing groups."</p>
<p>Next, Matsutani Yoichiro of the National League took the stage to question, "What are the concrete methods of ideological guidance? Does the government's suppression make the communists more acute?" Matsutani then raised the issue of educational suspicion and the redification of elementary school teachers in Nagano Prefecture, and severely questioned Minister of Education Hatoyama's responsibility before stepping down. The venue was in commotion. Minister of Justice Oyama and Vice-Minister Togo answered this. As a result, the Public Security Preservation Law and three other legal bills were referred to the committee for deliberation. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. (3rd Japan United Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Two Thousand Volumes to be Shipped to Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>(Berlin) In order to help China restore the Shanghai Zhabei Oriental Library, which was destroyed by Japanese troops during the January 28th Incident, the Emergency Joint Association organized by German scientists has collected more than 2,000 volumes of great German literary works, which are scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai within the next week. This move was initiated by many members of the Sino-German Friendship Association of Frankfurt in Germany who are traveling in Shanghai, and German libraries, publishing houses, and the scientific community and individuals have enthusiastically supported it. The collected books are related to the most advanced standard works of German science and culture. The goal is to enable Chinese people and scholars to understand German art and thought. In addition, there are many valuable books on the study of German architecture and the description of German scenery. The Oriental Library</p>
<p>originally had a complete set of Liebich's Yearbook of Chemistry and Pharmacology, from 1821 to 1930, which was also destroyed by artillery fire, which is a great pity. This book is now rare. A part of it has been found by members of the Friendship Association and shipped to Shanghai, and it is hoped that the remaining missing volumes can be gradually found from the hands of various private collectors. Furthermore, the German Farben Trust provided particularly strong support for this move and contributed a large sum of money when purchasing this chemical yearbook. The books can be shipped to Shanghai around the end of March, and according to the latest news, those in all circles in Germany who care about Chinese culture and friendship will continue to work on this throughout the year. This move by Germany is truly a model for other countries. (2nd National Telegram)</p>

The sudden increase in gold prices in London, England, shows that the price increases desired by the United States can also rise accordingly, proving that the United States can indeed manipulate global gold and commodity prices. Currently, the $2,000,000,000 stabilization exchange fund has not been fully utilized, and will likely wait until the planned price of $35 per ounce of gold can be implemented. According to financial circles, the new US monetary policy has caused no harm to the economic organizations of various countries. On the contrary, higher prices would benefit all countries. As for the devaluation of the US dollar, it is said to be intended to absorb foreign gold. (2nd, National Dispatch)</p>

The bank is planned to be located in Washington, D.C., as it is subordinate to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. As for the amount of capital, Jones said it has not yet been estimated, but will be approximately similar to the $400 million capital of the Commodity Credit Corporation.

<p>(Washington) Tentative and informal Anglo-American monetary discussions are currently underway, handled by diplomatic authorities from both sides or the Bank of England and the New York Federal Reserve Bank, as a preliminary step to formal negotiations. According to commercial reports, these talks aim to prevent a currency war, which would force France to abandon the gold standard. It is hoped that both sides can establish a temporary currency truce and use their equalization funds to seek exchange rate stability and avoid large-scale US gold trading abroad. Although the US capital advocates temporarily setting one pound equal to five US dollars, officials today clarified that no fixed ratio has been requested. Officials also acknowledge that Britain enjoys a special advantage in controlling the pound because the pound is not bound by gold. At the same time, the inflow of gold into the United States is only limited by shipping convenience, and gold worth over $30 million is currently awaiting shipment. Wall Street in New York indicates that yesterday's variable movements of the US dollar were due to the repatriation of US funds and the influx of foreign funds from France and elsewhere.

<p>Hirota States to British Reporter</p>
<p>(London) The London Daily Express today carried a Tokyo dispatch stating that the newspaper's reporter recently met with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota. In the conversation, Hirota declared that the former German Pacific islands, currently mandated to Japan by the League of Nations, would never be returned to the League of Nations under any circumstances. Hirota further stated that during the European War, the Allied Powers concluded a secret treaty with Japan, allowing Japan to receive land as compensation. Therefore, these former German islands should be ceded to Japan. The mandated procedure was merely a strategy to avoid President Wilson's opposition. Hirota concluded that the rights to govern these naval bases, which are of great military importance, are based on what can be called permanent jurisdiction, and that this permanent jurisdiction does not depend on the League of Nations.

<p>(Beiping) According to Zhangjia, the Inner Mongolia autonomy movement stems from political awakening and patriotic action. Since Inner Mongolia is part of Chinese territory, it must be under the command and rule of the central government. The central government should take advantage of the Mongolians' awakening to support the development of Inner Mongolian autonomy and consolidate the Inner Mongolian autonomous organization, so that it can defend against strong enemies externally and build the foundation of the nation internally. The central government's draft autonomy plan, based on the reports of Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Daiwen, should be handled with caution, and the opinions of the Inner Mongolian representatives should be taken into consideration as much as possible, so as not to betray the Mongolians' desire for autonomy. In the current situation of tension between Inner Mongolia and the central government, Inner Mongolian representatives should consider the unity of central government laws and administration, and the central government should also understand the psychology of the Mongolians.

<p>Britain Agrees to Allow Transportation Through Its Territory</p>
<p>(Moscow) Moscow newspapers published the following news: A dispatch from Istanbul states that local Hui people have received information about the so-called Kashgar government delegation, whose leader is the Hotan chieftain engaged in Gulpeng Uluoy. The delegation stayed in Kabul (the capital of Afghanistan) for several days, and then planned to go to India. The Kashgar delegation repeatedly met with the German envoy to Kabul to discuss the purchase of military equipment from Germany. The German envoy introduced the German businessman Aibonaer to the delegation, saying that he was the agent of the German military equipment company in Kabul. The military equipment currently under discussion will be transported to Afghanistan via India. Aibonaer is trying to obtain the consent of all parties involved in the transportation in order to be able to transport the goods. A Kashgar representative said that if the Afghan government allows the military equipment to be transported to Kashgar through Afghanistan, the British envoy to Kabul will fully assist in allowing transportation through India. Local Hui people also learned that Dr. Mositaifa Ali, a well-known reactionary politician, also participated in the above-mentioned transaction. After his conspiracy against the Turkish government in Smyrna was discovered, Dr. Mo escaped from Turkey. Last autumn, he traveled through India and Afghanistan to Kashgar. Local Hui people believe that the organization of the Kashgar government is the result of the initiative of both Britain and Germany, and it is also a clear evidence of the great powers continuing the policy of dividing China and building imperialist military bases in Central Asia.

<p>(Nanjing) Minister of the Interior Huang Shaoxiong made a statement on the issue of the China International Famine Relief Commission's registration, saying that he has always attached great importance to the undertakings of the commission. Since the promulgation of the regulations on the registration of charitable organizations, the commission has not completed the registration in accordance with the statutory procedures. After repeated urging, in order to determine its legal person status, it was submitted to the Beiping Municipal Government for transmittal to the Ministry for registration in January of this year, and requested that the Ministry be the direct supervisory body of the commission. This has been approved by the Ministry and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The so-called direct supervision refers only to the general commission. The branch commissions in various places should still be handled by the competent authorities in accordance with regulations. Now that the general commission is under the direct supervision of the Ministry, it will do its best to promote its development, and plans to send personnel to inspect it in the near future. It is deeply hoped that the commission will continue its past spirit and make greater progress, especially in completing the registration items and submitting them to the Ministry for approval in the near future.

<p>Conflict Between Military Cliques and Zaibatsu</p>
<p>The issue of military discipline has escalated from simmering tensions to open confrontation. Originally, within Japan, since the September 18th Shenyang Incident, all major domestic decisions have been made by the military, especially the army. Firstly, they had all made great contributions; secondly, the policies implemented by the military seemed effective. Therefore, the entire Japanese people focused their attention on military actions, believing that the inherent problems of Japan would be solved along with the expansion of territories. Contrary to expectations, occupying Manchuria, in the general Japanese ideal, was supposed to alleviate Japan’s economic difficulties, but in reality, besides expanding the military budget and increasing military industry, there were no other achievements. The general rural areas continued to suffer and bear heavier tax burdens. Regarding the benefits of immigration, the current puppet state (Manchuria) has only placed about two thousand Japanese officials, which has little impact on the unemployment problem of Japanese intellectuals. The armed immigration, which was vigorously promoted in rural areas, has only relocated about one thousand five hundred people to Jilin and Jiamusi in the past two years. It cannot be said to have alleviated the economic panic in rural areas. Therefore, the credibility of the military has gradually declined. However, because there are veterans' associations and various right-wing groups there to support the military, and with power as backing, although the people are full of dissatisfaction, no one dares to say a word. Newspapers cannot express any dissatisfaction. But before this session of the 65th Diet convened, there were various brewing, namely brewing a general attack on the military cliques. First, the zaibatsu took the opportunity to counterattack the military cliques. For more than two years, no one dared to criticize the Japanese military cliques, because they had made great achievements and had great power, so no one dared to say what shortcomings there were in the military's policy of invading China. Big and small bureaucrats had to follow the orders of the military. Although the zaibatsu were the main force in parliamentary politics, when military power was above everything else, they had no choice but to obey the military cliques. Therefore, no one dared to say anything about the assassinations of Junnosuke Inoue and Takuma Dan, nor dared to criticize Japan's security problems. Even Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, who was in office, was shot and killed by a dozen active-duty army and navy officers who broke into the official residence in broad daylight. No one dared to raise questions of responsibility. More than a year later, Seiyukai member Yutaka Miyazawa formally questioned the impropriety of punishing the army and navy murderers in the House of Representatives, daring to criticize it head-on. This is a fact rarely seen in a country ruled by law. However, Japan has never completely broken away from feudal relations, and when military cliques are rampant, the majority party in the Diet is also useless. Now that the military's weakness has been exposed, even those who support the military have adopted a spectator attitude. The general public is deeply dissatisfied with the actions of the military cliques, so the zaibatsu took the opportunity to rise up, wanting to frustrate the power of the military and restore the power of financial capital. Second, the issue of military discipline. In a militaristic country, military unity should be unquestionable. How could one know that within the Japanese military, the veteran faction and the young and middle-aged faction had different views on gradual and steady progress versus rapid and forceful action? Recently, this tendency has become clearer, both towards the Soviet Union and the United States. Now the people in the general class, such as Araki, also know that Japan cannot fight abroad now, because its economic power is weak. However, people below the rank of lieutenant colonel still advocate launching a war quickly. Therefore, recently, the general literary world in Japan is almost covered with publications that advocate war and promote extraordinary times. Therefore, the zaibatsu have now formally proposed in the Diet to ban books that advocate war. This is also one aspect of the struggle between the military and the zaibatsu. Third, the issue of ideology. In Japan, this divine country, dangerous thoughts breed exceptionally quickly. It is understandable that the people and farmers are seriously affected in their lives. It can also be explained that intellectuals such as the daughter of Hajime Kawakami are influenced by academic theories. Only the son of Zenjiro Shibata, the former cabinet secretary-general, has become a communist. Recently, the sister of Duke Iwakura Tomosada, the younger brother of Viscount Ogura Sueyoshi, the eldest son of Viscount Mori Toshinari, and the second son of Viscount Hachijo Takamasa are all active participants in the red underground movement. Moreover, it is said that there are forty or fifty students of the aristocracy in Gakushuin who have been infected by communism. These are all reactions to the military's policy of aggression, and they are also powerful weapons to attack the current government. Therefore, military men have to retreat temporarily. Although parliamentary politics may not necessarily rise, military dictatorship is not easy to realize temporarily. (Tokyo, January 28, 1934)</p>
<h3 id="e95">First Phase of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan Completed <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>| Liu Xiang Talks About Bandit Suppression, Rehabilitation, and Advancement |</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Sichuan's military campaign to suppress bandits, since the 1st Route cleared bandits in Zhaohua, Guangyuan, and Jian'ge; the 2nd Route cleared bandits along the Langzhong-Ba Road; the 3rd and 4th Routes cleared bandits in Yingjing and Peng'an; the 2nd and 3rd Routes cleared bandits in Yilong; and the 5th Route cleared bandits in Xuanhan and Sui County, the first phase of the bandit suppression plan was completely completed, and it rapidly transitioned to the second phase. This was in mid-January. After January 17th, Wang Lingji, Commander-in-Chief of the 5th Route, and Fan Shaozeng, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, learned that the bandit Xu's ammunition had been exhausted, so they led their troops to climb vines and brave the snow, taking advantage of the situation to advance rapidly. On the 23rd, they captured Madu Pass, the only natural barrier between Suixuan, Tongjiang, and Bazhong. Because the bandits lost their barrier to Tongjiang and Bazhong, their momentum was greatly diminished, and they were on the verge of annihilation, retreating a hundred miles a day. The reporter, believing that the Sichuan situation had transitioned from a period of full-force bandit suppression to a period of simultaneous bandit suppression and rehabilitation, visited Liu Xiang yesterday to inquire about his usual methods for carrying out the three points of bandit suppression, rehabilitation, and development. Liu Xiang replied as follows: (I (Liu referring to himself) have been entrusted by the Central Government with the dual responsibilities of bandit suppression and rehabilitation. Knowing my own inadequacy and inability to bear such a heavy burden, I have been conscientious and self-disciplined day and night. For the past six months, fortunately, all parties have cooperated and devoted their efforts to suppressing bandits. Seeing the successive recapture of Xuanhan, Sui County, Yingjing, and Yilong, the remnants of bandits in Zhaohua, Guangyuan, Jian'ge, Langzhong, Cangxi, Nanbu, and Peng'an counties have also been gradually eliminated. The bandits' momentum has been greatly diminished, and we are currently formulating a second step encirclement plan to completely eliminate them between Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, preventing them from fleeing and causing further harm to neighboring provinces. As for the current rehabilitation strategies, we are leading the entire Sichuan military and civilians to present their abilities and talents and make the best use of them to engage in development. We must break the past situation of horizontal and vertical divisions and armed coercion and transition to competition in business, making the best use of everyone's abilities and the land, so that everyone has a job and helps each other in governance. Recently, our army has been striving to reduce its size, reducing two soldiers per squad, and has successively discharged more than 20,000 officers and soldiers, intending to show consideration for the people's strength and establish a standard first, not to restrict all armies to reduce their size. As for the overall plan, it will only be possible to implement it when everyone has a job. Currently, it is hoped that all armies can unanimously influence each other, reduce their size on their own, and strive to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. However, there is absolutely no intention of requesting or restricting other armies to follow suit. Furthermore, rumors that the Sichuan army has been reorganized into three armies and that the governor's office has established several departments are also not true. Because during this period of bandit suppression and rehabilitation, all provincial government matters and war powers of the governor's office will only be handled in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government. There are no preconceived notions or any decisions. I personally only know to obey the orders of the Central Government and fulfill my duties. Everything else is beyond my concern. At this critical time of urgent foreign and domestic troubles, there is no other way to survive except to work hard, be pragmatic, and lead by example." (National News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Military Affairs Commission Announces Ironclad Proof of the Fujian Rebel Army's Alliance with the Communists <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The First Department of the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission announces one of the ironclad proofs of the Fujian rebel army's alliance with the Red bandits, recorded as follows: According to personnel who previously served in the rebel 61st Division, they carried an order issued by the rebel division in Quanzhou at 10:10 AM on December 28th. The first item stated that our friendly forces were concentrated in Tai'ning and were attacking the enemy's right flank towards Shunchang and Jian'ou. The second item stated that our First Front Army was gathering forces in Fuzhou to lure the enemy deep, etc. The so-called "Our First Front Army" refers to the entire rebel army of the former 19th Route Army. The so-called "Our friendly forces" refers to the Red bandits. This is evidenced by the fact that the main force of the rebel army is currently concentrated near Fuzhou, and the main force of the Jiangxi Red bandits is gathering in Jian'ning, Tai'ning, and Xiamao, etc., which coincides with the order mentioned by the rebels. A mimeographed copy of the order issued by the rebel division commander Liang Shiji is hereby printed and announced to the people of the country to clarify the crime of the rebels' alliance with the Red bandits to endanger our party and country.

<h3 id="e98">19th Route Army in Quanzhou Obeys Reorganization and Disbandment <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>= Cai Tingkai's Situation When He Was Defeated and Fled =</p>
<p>= 19th Route Army Obeys Orders to Leave Quanzhou and Await Reorganization =</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: When the 19th Route Army was in Fuzhou, Cai Tingkai still wanted to combine the main forces of the Shen District and Mao's various units to fight a decisive battle with the Central Army at Shuikou and Gutian. However, when Cai led the army to Shuikou, there was not a single soldier there. At this point, he realized that the strategy had failed and knew that the Central Army in Yanping and Shuikou had already crossed the river and was heading to Youxi, going south towards Yongtai and Xianyou, encircling the retreat route in southern Fujian. Cai then ordered the abandonment of Fuzhou and a general retreat towards southern Fujian. They did not dare to stay in Minqing and Fuqing along the way. Xianyou was already occupied by the 10th Division of the Central Army, and the 83rd Division had also encircled Baoling in northern Hui'an, cutting off the rear route. Cai himself was in Putian at that time, commanding the entire army, hoping to defend Putian and Xianyou to the death. Later, the rear route Futuling was cut off, and Cai was also surrounded. Therefore, Li Jinsheng, the head of Cai's special service regiment, personally led three companies to charge Wangling fiercely. Cai followed in a car, breaking through the encirclement. He had only a few dozen people left in Hui'an. When Cai's car broke through, the horse grooms and others in the car were destroyed, and all the guards died. It was almost a miracle that Cai was not captured. This was at noon on January 20th. As for the retreating soldiers, they still fought fiercely with the Central Army at Tuling and Kandou on the morning of the 21st and then retreated to Huian for a short rest, then retreated to Quanzhou. Wei Lihuang captured Huixian County on the afternoon of the 21st, and the vanguard arrived at Luoyang Bridge that night. The 19th Route Army was south of Luoyang Bridge, facing the Central Army across the bridge. Cai and others arrived in Quanzhou on the evening of the 20th and stayed at Mao Weisou's residence in Yuqun Lane. Soon they learned that the generals had the intention of defecting and that the situation could not be salvaged, so they expressed their intention to leave. That night, Shen and Mao held a farewell banquet. During the banquet, they looked at each other sadly. On the morning of the 21st, Cai took a car with a secretary and dozens of guards, bidding farewell to the south. On the verge of departure, he still urged them to preserve their strength and retreat. At 10:00 AM, he arrived in Zhangzhou. At that time, the 19th Route Army in Zhangzhou had already retreated completely. He then followed the last sentry westward to Longyan. After Cai left, the division commanders promoted Mao Weisou to be the temporary commander of the entire army. On one hand, they sent Zhao Jinwen, the staff officer of the 61st Division, to Luoyang Town alone to bring a letter to Wei Lihuang, explaining that the 19th Route Army had all defected and would await the Central Government's handling. Please do not attack again to avoid sacrifices on both sides. Wei, because he had not yet received the Central Government's orders, telegraphed Chiang Ting-wen for instructions. Chiang Ting-wen had just received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, so he replied to stop the attack. Wei then immediately agreed to a ceasefire. That day, Chiang Ting-wen sent an adjutant to Luoyang to convey Chairman Chiang's telegram. The adjutant also went to Quanzhou in the same car with the commander of the 83rd Division to meet Mao. Also coming were the chief of staff of the 83rd Division and two regimental commanders. Mao and Shen hosted a banquet for them and returned to Luoyang that night. When the 19th Route Army defected, the Central Government's telegram ordered: (1) Designate locations for separate assembly and await the Central Government's personnel for reorganization; (2) The 60th Division is designated to assemble at Yuzhen in Fuqing, the 61st Division at Tuling and Kantou in Huian, the 78th Division at Hanjiang in Putian, the 49th Division at Fengting in Xianyou, and Qiu Zhaochen's unit at Jiangkou; (3) Reorganization method: officers and soldiers below the rank of battalion commander can choose to stay and await reorganization or surrender their weapons, receive gratuities, and be sent back to their hometowns. The appointment and dismissal of senior officers above the rank of battalion commander are subject to the Central Government's orders; (4) Comply with the orders and leave Quanzhou completely before the 25th, and depart to the designated locations. After Wei Lihuang contacted Mao Weisou and others, the result was that Mao and others were willing to comply with the orders. At about 4:00 AM on the 25th, the troops in Quanzhou began to leave Quanzhou, passing through the Central Army's position at Luoyang Bridge through the east gate and heading towards Huian, Putian, Fuqing, Xianyou, and other places. The 19th Route Army troops originally stationed in Shashi, Qingyuan, Honglai, Anhai, Guanqiao, and Xiwei had all retreated to Quanzhou first and departed together. By 2:00 PM on the 25th, the joint office of the four divisions of the 19th Route Army in Quanzhou had also withdrawn from the city. The entire withdrawal was completed by about 5:00 PM. Only one battalion of Pang Chenggen's 61st Division was stationed in Quanzhou to maintain order. At about 8:00 PM that night, Chen Peiyu's unit of Chen Guohui's remnants and Huang Yuxi and others entered the city from the south gate. Peng Tang entered the city from the west gate. Peng surrendered dozens of weapons from the Public Security Bureau and then withdrew from the city. Chen fought fiercely with the sentries of the 19th Route Army on South Street. Chen's unit was defeated and had a hundred weapons confiscated, including more than forty Mauser pistols and more than eighty rifles. Chen's unit originally came to seize weapons, truly "trying to steal a chicken but losing rice instead." At 10:00 PM, the 10th Division of Wei Lihuang's unit entered the city from Luoyang Bridge. They heard fierce street fighting in the city and knew that it was militia coming to seize weapons. Therefore, they joined forces with the 19th Route Army to confiscate Chen's unit's weapons and disperse more than a hundred militiamen. On the morning of the 26th, the last troops of the 19th Route Army retreated completely. The 10th Division immediately announced a curfew throughout the city, prohibiting militia from entering the city. The Fifth Route Command of Wei Lihuang also moved from Luoyang Bridge to the old government office on Hui Street in Quanzhou. The 10th Division and the 83rd Division successively entered the city that day. Wei Lihuang also entered Quanzhou at noon. Chiang Ting-wen went to Tong'an from Xiamen on the 25th to command the 3rd Division to advance to Shuitou. The 89th Division took over the defense of Xiwei, Guanqiao, and Anhai. They also entered Quanzhou by car from Tong'an in the afternoon of the 26th, staying at the Lianhuan Society with Wei. The 89th Division entered Quanzhou on the 27th. Division Commander Tang Enbo also arrived. The unit was stationed in Honglai. There are currently three divisions in Quanzhou: the 10th, 93rd, and 89th. After the 19th Route Army departed, Mao Weisou, Ou Shounian, Shen Guanghan, and Zhang Yan all followed the army. Only Tan Qixiu was eliminated. The four divisions of Shen and Mao, in addition to the parts that were eliminated in Baisha, Huian, and Putian, still have a total strength of 30,000 men gathering in various places in compliance with orders. Mao and Zhang returned to Quanzhou from Huian on the 27th to negotiate reorganization matters with Chiang Ting-wen and Wei Lihuang. However, although the 19th Route Army still has a strength of 30,000 men, this time they are gathering separately in various places, all in areas crowded with the Central Army. Their strength has already been dispersed, making it easy to reorganize and disband them. Chiang Ting-wen flew to Fuzhou again from Quanzhou on the 28th. The military affairs in southern Fujian have come to an end here. (January 29th)</p>

About two hundred rickshaws staged a full strike and prevented horse-drawn carriages from picking up passengers at the station. The situation was very tense. Stationmaster Zhuang and others went to the rickshaw pullers' union and invited Chairman Li Jingcheng and Standing Committee member Lu Yiwan to mediate.

<p>The Rice, Bean, and Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association of this county previously reduced the commission of 1% (one cent per dollar) deducted for buying and selling on behalf of customers due to the drastic drop in the market price of rice and grain over the years. However, various expenses have become increasingly heavy and difficult to maintain. Therefore, it was decided that from July 1st of last year, the commission would be changed to 0.16%. It is now learned that the Wujin trade association also feels that the original 1% commission is insufficient to cover expenses. It has consulted with the trade association of this county back and forth and decided to uniformly follow the example of this county and change it to 0.16%. It will be implemented from February 18th of this year.</p>

<p>Yu Liankui, the director of the Wuyi Detention Center, said that most of the detainees were cases sent by the county government, either bandits or thieves. They were all afraid of being punished severely during the strict campaign to eliminate bandits. Therefore, they were arrogant and domineering, breaking the regulations of the center. Even for minor matters, they would gather and shout. Recently, they even intended to cause trouble in the prison and could not be reformed, especially Zhang Shuda and Wang Mingzhang. Yesterday, he specially requested instructions from the county government. County Magistrate Cai instructed that the two prisoners were indeed extremely illegal and should be transferred to prison for custody pending investigation.</p>

<p>Previously, people from this county, deeply concerned about the impact on the Huainan market due to Lianghuai Transport Commissioner Miao Qiujie's proposal to abolish the administrative power of the Huainan Deputy Transport Commissioner and relocate transport merchants northward, requested Wang Boling, a member of the Central Committee, to directly telegraph Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance to take measures to prevent it. The Ministry of Finance immediately replied, agreeing to discuss the matter at length. Furthermore, Hu Zhen, Bao Xiangzhong, and others submitted petitions to various departments, provinces, and counties, appealing to prevent the decline of the Yangzhou market. Now, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance still insists on collecting taxes and releasing salt in Yangzhou. However, administrative matters concerning the distribution of salt permits must be unified under the Transport Commissioner. The Ministry of Finance's approval of the petitions submitted by Hu Zhen, Bao Xiangzhong, and others is recorded below: (The petition has been noted. This Ministry, in order to reorganize Lianghuai transport affairs and unify authority, has already approved the management of salt permit distribution in the Xiang, E, West Anhui, and West Anhui areas by the Lianghuai Transport Commissioner. This measure only slightly modifies the merchants' reporting procedures. Tax collection and salt release for sail-transported goods will continue to be managed by the Yangzhou Audit Sub-Office, concurrently handled by the Huainan Deputy Transport Commissioner, which will not affect the Yangzhou market or finance. The petition appears to be a misunderstanding. It is hereby approved for your information.)</p>

<p>In recent years, rural areas have been on the verge of bankruptcy, and the economic panic has reached its peak. The reason is nothing more than low grain prices harming farmers. Currently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Finance are actively planning to rescue rural areas. Since the commencement of this work, it has been decided to first organize agricultural warehouse management committees in Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, and other counties, temporarily collecting four types of food grains: rice, wheat, paddy, and beans, according to market prices and storing them in the warehouses of each county. The purpose is to stabilize market prices and circulate rural finance, so that farmers will not lament "no one wants to exchange goods for money." It is heard that the personnel for the agricultural warehouse management committees in the three counties are all appointed by the Department of Finance, including local county magistrates and bankers, etc. They were dispatched a few days ago, carrying cash, to various villages to purchase grain, slightly raising the price per dan (unit of weight) according to local market prices. Since the commencement of purchases, farmers have been enthusiastically selling accumulated grain. In addition, the influx of large amounts of cash into the countryside has gradually activated financial turnover, which is widely praised as convenient.</p>

<p>In the Xiaowuji area, bordering Siyang County, northwest of Yugou Town in the Fourth District of Huaiyin, a villager named Lin Yucheng's son, Zongmei, had served as a soldier in the supplementary regiments of the 25th and 1st Route Armies, and also served as a detective in the county police brigade. He had successively arrested bandits Chen Weigang, Liu Si, and Liu Qicai, all of whom had been executed. As a result, he incurred deep resentment from the bandits. On the evening of the 29th of the month, the bandits gathered a gang of more than ten people and went to his house. They first restrained Yucheng, his wife Zhou, his third daughter-in-law Chen, and his fifth son Zongren, and shot them all to death. However, Zongmei, who was living in the county town, escaped the attack.

Commander Shi, based on their confession, believed that the two soldiers were so audacious and disregarded the law, deserving of the severest punishment. He immediately reported to the Security Office and obtained permission to execute them by firing squad. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the two convicts were identified and tied up before being taken to the South Training Ground in the city for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Since County Magistrate Qi Lunjie took office in Jintan, he has actively promoted the organization of cooperatives. More than 70 cooperatives for silkworm rearing, fish farming, irrigation, and consumption have been established, providing considerable relief to the rural economy. In order to rectify the content of each cooperative and achieve perfection, the county government specially convened directors, supervisors, chairmen, and treasurers of each cooperative from January 22nd to 28th, holding short-term training in the county middle school building. They were taught general concepts of cooperation, bookkeeping laws, and knowledge of agricultural bank lending. Moreover, since most of the staff members are township heads and deputies from various districts and towns, as well as people of good repute in rural areas, and silkworm rearing cooperatives account for about three-quarters of the total, experts were also hired to lecture on rural autonomy and sericulture, as a guideline for promoting autonomy and improving sericulture in the future. All expenses for meals and accommodation for the trainees were provided by the county government. The opening ceremony was held at 8 a.m. on the 22nd, with 193 trainees from various cooperatives attending, as well as Wang Xizeng, a representative from the Department of Civil Affairs, Tong Yumin, a representative from the Department of Construction, and more than 40 representatives from various agencies. After the ceremony, Chairman Qi Lunjie, the county magistrate, reported on the significance of the training, and the representatives from the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction delivered exhortations. Subsequently, representatives from various agencies, Wang Yu, Liu Zhenqun, Tang Chengsi, Zhao Zezhou, and Han Dasou, delivered speeches one after another, with many warnings. Experts and celebrities were invited to give lectures on the 29th.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Zhenru Radio Station, has added wireless equipment for direct Sino-British communication. Since the foundation was laid and construction began in June of last year, it was completed at the end of last year. After a successful trial broadcast, the opening ceremony was held at 3 p.m. yesterday. Zhu Jia-hua, Minister of Communications, came to Shanghai from Beijing to preside over the ceremony, and Mrs. Zhu, Ms. Cheng Peifen, personally performed the unveiling ceremony. Yesterday, those who attended, in addition to Wu Tiecheng and others, representatives from the Central Government and the National Government, and the British Consul General, Mr. Brenan, included more than 200 Chinese and foreign guests. After the unveiling ceremony, guests were invited to visit the electrical equipment. From 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., Minister Zhu also held a tea party at No. 80 Seymour Road to celebrate. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Venue Arrangement <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The International Wireless Radio Station is located north of Zhenru Railway Station, covering an area of more than 200 mu (unit of area). The main entrance faces the Zhenpu River, connected by a wooden bridge. The national emblem is crossed at the entrance. Inside the venue, national flags are hung on the antenna towers. The venue is located east of the radio room, with a temporary bamboo shed built. The flag of the Ministry of Communications with its electric symbol is hung in front of the main entrance of the radio room, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the Party and National flags above it. Below is the platform. The walls inside the venue are covered with the flags of England, Germany, America, and France. To the left of the platform is the orchestra.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in addition to the Minister of Communications Zhu Jia-hua and his wife, guests included Wu Tiecheng, representative of the Central Government and the National Government and Mayor of Shanghai; Chu Minyi, representative of the Executive Yuan; Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce; Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Roads Bureau; Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government; Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau; and Shi Liangcai, as well as Brenan, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and Massey, the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, and diplomatic officials and chamber of commerce representatives from various countries, totaling approximately 200 people.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Opening Ceremony <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Communications Zhu Jia-hua, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, British Consul-General Brenan, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce Massey, and Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, and Mrs. Zhu Cheng Peifen successively ascended the platform. The ceremony was presided over by Minister Zhu, with Lu Hongxun, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the International Telecommunications Bureau, as the master of ceremonies. The Public Security Bureau Military Band played music. After the formalities, Minister Zhu delivered the opening speech, followed by an address by Mayor Wu, representative of the Central Government and the National Government. Subsequently, guests Chu Minyi, representative of the Executive Yuan, British Consul-General Brenan, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce Massey, and Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai delivered speeches one after another, expressing enthusiastic sentiments regarding central diplomatic relations and commerce. The foreign guests present applauded to show their welcome.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Chairman's Report <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Zhu reported, "Since the Sino-British Radio Station began construction in January of last year, all projects were completed by the end of last year. After multiple tests, the results were very good. Today, we are holding the opening ceremony to officially begin communication. From now on, Sino-British wireless telecommunications can be directly connected. Before today, Sino-British telecommunications could only be directly connected through foreign-operated submarine cables. As for the transmission of wireless telecommunications, it was only transferred through Sino-French or Sino-German lines. There was no direct communication equipment. This biased situation makes us very regretful. The development of China's international telecommunications initially relied on submarine cables, and the Sino-British submarine cable telecommunications equipment was the earliest to operate. However, since China built the International Wireless Radio Station in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), it automatically began to develop international wireless telecommunications in order to seek closer contact with the world. Subsequently, direct wireless communication was established with the United States, France, Germany, Russia, and Switzerland. Even Manila and Batavia can directly communicate using wireless telecommunications. However, Sino-British telecommunications, which utilized submarine cables the earliest, lagged behind in wireless telecommunications. Isn't this something to be regretted? Therefore, we quickly devised a way to add this Sino-British Radio Station, so that China and Britain have the same connection as other countries in wireless communication, and we hope that the entire connection of China's wireless communication with the world can be completed. The completion of this Sino-British Radio Station has even deeper significance, worthy of careful consideration. The close relationship between China and Britain has always been evident. We can see it from the reporting. According to our statistics, the telegrams between China and London each year account for more than half of our total European reporting revenue. From this statistic alone, we can see how close the relationship is. We attach importance to this close relationship. We especially attach importance to China and Britain using this close relationship to increase cooperation and mutual assistance, because both China and Britain need mutual assistance in education, culture, and economy. The purpose of building the Sino-British Radio Station is to hope that this friendship and cooperation will have more convenience in material equipment, and we hope to use this convenience of material equipment to make the friendship and cooperation between China and Britain closer. Looking at this year, although China is experiencing internal and external troubles and financial difficulties, the construction of this Sino-British Radio Station has not been interrupted due to environmental difficulties. This shows how much we hope for the mission of the Sino-British Radio Station. Now that the Central Radio Station has been completed, we</p>

<p>believe that its effect will surely reach the realm jointly expected by the two countries. Today, we are holding the opening ceremony, and we are very honored to have all the guests present to participate. However, this Sino-British Radio Station is in its initial stage, and there must be many shortcomings. We hope that everyone will not hesitate to correct us."</p>
<h3 id="e122">Wu's Address <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After Minister Zhu's report, Wu Tiecheng, representative of the Central Party Department and the National Government and Mayor of Shanghai, delivered an address, saying, "Today, the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is holding the opening ceremony of the Sino-British direct circuit. I am honored to be ordered by the Central Government to participate in this grand ceremony, and I would like to express my hopes. We use a historical perspective to observe that the development of transportation is truly a great driving force for the progress of modern countries. Just looking at the two points of post and telecommunications, from 1881 to 1913, the number of post offices in Britain increased from 15,400 to 24,600, in France from 6,700 to 15,700, and in Germany from 12,500 to 51,600. At the same time, the average number of mail items per year for each person in the country increased from 40 to 96 in Britain, from 16 to 40 in France, and from 17 to 80 in Germany. The development and increase in these numbers of mail items can measure the degree of political progress in modern European countries. Modern international relations are becoming increasingly complex, and the opportunities and needs for mutual assistance and cooperation among nations are also increasing. Therefore, post and telecommunications are naturally indispensable tools for improving international relations and promoting national sentiments. The British historian H.G. Wells once said that the reason why Central European nations cannot understand each other is due to the separation of their circumstances. We must naturally strive to make up for and eliminate this international defect. The Chinese proverb says that human determination can overcome nature. Modern material civilization and the development of transportation have already broken through the natural and material obstacles in the universe that were previously unbreakable by humans. Why can't we go a step further to strive to eliminate the emotional and spiritual barriers between nations? Therefore, today's opening of the Sino-British direct circuit of the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications represents the beginning of the Chinese nation's efforts to eliminate national barriers and make up for international defects. After the Sino-British direct circuit, it will not only increase the convenience of mutual communication between the two major nations of China and Britain, but also promote the harmony between the two major nations of China and Britain.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wang's Speech <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, said in his speech, "Today is the opening ceremony for the Sino-British direct line of the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications. In other words, it can be said that China has won a speaking mouth in Europe. We often hear people say that when it comes to military operations, the most important thing is the seaport, because with a seaport, transportation is convenient, so the first step in a war is to blockade the seaport. Once the seaport is blockaded, you cannot enter or exit, as if you are holding someone's throat, and this person will inevitably suffocate. But we must know that the current world is not just a world of war with weapons, but also a world that pays attention to the work of publicity. But when it comes to publicity, you must have a mouth. If you are a mute and rely on others to speak, sometimes the things you want to say, people will not say for you, or the things you don't want to say, people will spread them everywhere. Over time, what is false becomes true, and you have a belly full of grievances, and where can you vent them? I think, not to mention malicious publicity, deliberately reversing right and wrong, even unintentional mistakes can greatly affect you. Then, what is the mouth of propaganda now? It is the international telecommunications business. For forty years, my country's international telecommunications business has always been operated by foreign submarine cable companies. If we want to speak to foreigners, we must first go through the throats of foreigners. This is really inconvenient. I think, to put it lightly, it is called the outflow of rights and interests, and to put it more seriously, it is simply inverting the dagger. The outflow of rights and interests is the loss of the benefits of telecommunications, and inverting the dagger is the loss of the power of telecommunications. So often there are many things that are clearly so and so, but when they are transmitted to foreign countries, they become this and that. The most ridiculous thing is that even Chinese ambassadors and consuls abroad have to ask foreign telecommunications agencies to know the news of their own country. Do you all think it is ridiculous? Therefore, the National Government, when it was in Guangdong, had already noticed this point. From the 18th to the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1929 to 1934), in these six years, through the continuous efforts of the Ministry of Communications, it expanded the direct communication lines from Shanghai to nine places including Manila, Hong Kong, Batavia, San Francisco, Berlin, Paris, Saigon, Geneva, and Moscow. Now it has added the direct line between Shanghai and London. We know that Shanghai is the telecommunications hub of China, and London is the telecommunications hub of Europe. Therefore, the direct line between Shanghai and London, I said at the beginning, is that China has won a speaking mouth in Europe. This is of course something to be congratulated on.</p>

<h3 id="e125">White's Speech <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Next, British Consul General Mr. Brenan and Mr. Massey successively delivered speeches. Mr. Brenan said in his speech, "Everyone who is present to participate in the grand ceremony of the first direct communication between China and Britain today must feel happy. China and Britain have a long and good history in diplomatic, cultural and commercial relations. Now that the direct communication report is completed, there will be a cheap, high-quality and rapid transportation system between the two countries from now on, and its benefits to the increase of friendship between the two countries are even more profound. In the past, communication between Europe and Asia was only by ships, and it took six months to get a reply. Today, the situation has changed greatly. The invention of steamships, the opening of the Suez Canal, the establishment of submarine telegraph cables, and the success of wireless radio have made the close relationship between China and Britain today incomparable to the past, and the trade between the two countries occupies an important position in international politics. Some people may say that foreign representatives like me should not welcome the tools that facilitate transportation, because in the past, when communication was inconvenient, the power of each representative was greater. Today, even minor matters need to be referred to the government, and those who are local representatives are, at best, puppets who only listen to orders. Whether this statement is true or not, I will not discuss it for the time being, but I am very willing to communicate with the people on the other end of the radio waves. Therefore, I express my sincere congratulations on the completion of this station, and I deeply believe that it will make immeasurable contributions to the future of Sino-British commerce, and I am happy to congratulate Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications even more."</p>
<h3 id="e126">Massey's Speech <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, the British Boxer Indemnity Committee, the British Chamber of Commerce, and the Joint Committee of the Associated British Chambers of Commerce, although they are two different organizations, they all pay close attention to businesses that are mutually beneficial to China and Britain. As the Vice Chairman of the British Boxer Indemnity Committee, I deeply feel that the Committee's loan to the Ministry of Communications to purchase the various equipment needed for this radio station has truly benefited China and Britain. At the same time, from the perspective of the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, I especially believe that the official opening of direct communication between China and Britain can promote commerce and greatly help merchants who need rapid and reliable services. On behalf of the two organizations, I congratulate Minister Yan, Director Wen, and all the colleagues of the Ministry of Communications for their efforts to make the direct communication between China and Britain a success. As the saying goes, time is money. The accuracy of this saying is almost unsurpassed today. The more advanced commerce is, the more it needs faster and more reliable transportation services. The Ministry of Communications, in view of this, established this radio station to connect direct transportation between China and Britain. The machines used are all the latest Marconi type, and all the advances in scientific research are available, which is truly suitable for the needs of all merchants. The direct communication between China and Britain is no longer relayed by Paris or Berlin. The transmission is faster and can avoid the errors of wired telegraphs. The convenience is obvious. It is said that the characteristic of this radio station is the principle of grabbing light bands. This principle was discovered by Marconi. Before, when Mr. Marconi came to China and visited the Zhenru Radio Station, he greatly praised the beauty of the Chinese engineering construction project. One of the most interesting features of this station is wireless telephone. This telephone is currently limited to international speeches or music broadcasts. I hope that this convenience can be expanded to commercial telephone, so that we can talk directly to London. The advantage of telephone is that a few minutes of talk can often eliminate many difficulties that telegrams cannot. If the call can be made early, it will benefit merchants greatly. The authorities of the Ministry of Communications know that the success of the radio station depends on the engineers being familiar with everything. Therefore, in addition to adopting the latest machines, they also specially sent four engineers to England to investigate and study everything. They are familiar with all the usage methods of the Marconi light band radio station. After studying at the Marconi Engineering School, they went to various places and radio stations to investigate. After the engineers returned to China, they were assigned to important positions in this radio station. In the future, the control and management will be easy to handle. Minister Zhu's enthusiasm for the future of transportation is truly a great reliance on national construction.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary, Postmaster General, and radio inventor Marconi, among others, have sent telegrams of congratulations. Details of congratulatory telegrams exchanged between Britain and our country are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) British Foreign Secretary Simon to the Minister of Foreign Affairs: "On this occasion of the first direct radio communication between London and Shanghai, I extend to Your Excellency this telegram of congratulations. I am particularly pleased, as the relationship between China and Britain has been constantly in my thoughts lately. I have discussed everything with Sir Lampson and Sir O’Malley, who is about to go to your country. I am confident that the special and excellent relationship between the two countries created by Sir Lampson during his previous residency in China will be fully maintained during Sir O’Malley’s term. This new method of communication is itself a clear demonstration of Sino-British cooperation, and will further enhance all the points we cherish, such as friendship between the two countries, mutual understanding, and commercial and cultural ties."</p>
<p>(2) President Wang's reply to the British Foreign Secretary: "To His Excellency Sir John Simon, British Foreign Secretary, upon receiving your telegram, I learned that Your Excellency, on behalf of the British government, extended congratulations on the first direct Sino-British radio communication.

<h3 id="e131">Ambassador Yan Huiqing Returns to the Country Yesterday and Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Will enter Beijing today or tomorrow to pay respects to the authorities</p>
<p>Then go to Tianjin to handle personal matters Our Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Yan Huiqing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 pm aboard the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso. He is scheduled to enter Beijing today or tomorrow to pay respects to Chairman Lin and President Wang. He plans to stay in Beijing for one or two days, then return to Tianjin to rest and handle personal matters. Afterwards, he will come to Beijing again to report everything to the Central Government, request instructions on foreign policy, and then return to his post in six months. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Will Go to Beijing Today or Tomorrow <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Ambassador Yan arrived in Shanghai at about 4:50 pm yesterday afternoon aboard the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso, which docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. After disembarking, Ambassador Yan immediately transferred to the Jianghai Customs Jinghui small ferry to cross the river. At about 5:30 pm, he landed at the Bund Copper Man Wharf on Nanjing Road and went directly to the Cathay Hotel to rest. Ambassador Yan will take a train to Beijing today or tomorrow to pay respects to Chairman Lin and President Wang, and then return to Tianjin. During Ambassador Yan's return to the country, all embassy duties will be temporarily handled by Counselor Wu Nanru.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Wang and Song Both Send Representatives to Welcome <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Those who went to the wharf yesterday to welcome Ambassador Yan included Shen Jinding, representing Executive Yuan President and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jingwei; Yang Guangshao, representing National Economic Council Standing Committee Member Song Ziwen; Geng Jiaji, representing Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng; Zhou Jue, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Zhao Tiezhang, Section Chief; Zhang Ming, former Special Envoy to Nepal; Yan Fuqing and Yan Deqing, younger brothers of Ambassador Yan; Soviet Consul General in Shanghai Spirivinnek; and more than fifty friends and relatives of Ambassador Yan and reporters from various newspapers. The representatives of Wang and Song took the Jinghui small ferry to cross the river, the representative of Mayor Wu took the Public Security small ferry to cross the river, and the relatives of Ambassador Yan took the Haigang Quarantine Station's Yue Fei and Huatuo small ferries to cross the river. The Public Concession Water Police Department specially sent six Chinese and Western detectives yesterday to accompany the Jinghui small ferry to cross the river for protection.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Mr. Yan Looks Older Than Before <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yan was appointed as envoy to the United States after the September 18th Incident in 1931. Soon after, he represented the National Government as a plenipotentiary representative to the League of Nations, and was transferred to be the Ambassador to Russia. It has been two years since he returned to the country yesterday. Although he has experienced wind and fatigue, his spirit is as always, but the number of his white hair has increased more than before. When Mr. Yan arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he was wearing a tweed suit, a blue wool overcoat, and a gray wool hat. His attitude was natural and his conversation was quite refreshing. He is truly a rare talent in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Mr. Yan Meets Reporters in the Ship <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Ambassador Yan met with reporters from various newspapers in the ship. According to him, he departed from Moscow on December 8th last year and boarded a ship from Italy on January 10th. This time he returned to the country without any mission. He just requested leave from the Central Government to return to the country and report on the situation abroad because he had not returned to the country for a long time. He has been away from the country for two years, and is not familiar with the domestic situation. He is eager to return to the country, but he has been unable to do so due to busy affairs. Now that he has safely returned to the country, unless there is an emergency, he plans to stay for several months and then return to his post to cancel the leave.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ambassador Yan Huiqing Photographed on Landing (Gong Shuxian) <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<h3 id="e137">Will Enter Beijing Today or Tomorrow and Go to Tianjin Immediately <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Ambassador Yan continued, "I am scheduled to enter Beijing the day after tomorrow (i.e., today or tomorrow) to pay respects to the Acting Foreign Minister Wang and report on the situation abroad over the past two years. I will decide to stay in Beijing for one day and then cross the river to change trains to Tianjin for a short stay. Then I will return to the capital to discuss all issues with the Central Government. Of course, diplomatic issues will also be discussed. During my return to the country, I will pay attention to observing the feelings of the people, because national affairs should be based on public opinion. The government acts according to public opinion, and the overseas envoys only follow the orders of the government, in other words, listen to public opinion. For two years, I have been separated from the national situation and public opinion. Telegrams and newspapers cannot fully explain everything, so it is best to observe in person. Therefore, the purpose of this trip back to the country is purely to observe public opinion, and according to the regulations of various countries, all overseas officials must return to the country once a year to observe public opinion and understand the national situation. I have been abroad for more than two years, and this return to the country is also expected."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Russo-Japanese War is Quite Possible <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>"The relationship between Japan and Russia has become increasingly tense recently, and the outbreak of war is quite possible. However, the remarks I made that were transmitted by the Hong Kong telegram are somewhat exaggerated. The Soviet Union is paying close attention to the Far East. On the one hand, it hopes that peace can be maintained, and on the other hand, it prepares to give a head-on blow to the aggressors. As for our country, we hope to maintain peace in East Asia, but we also need to strengthen our national strength to deal with the current emergency."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Russia Will Never Recognize the Puppet Organization <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>"After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the Soviet Union has a very good feeling towards China. The results of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan are very good. The second Five-Year Plan is currently being implemented. The Soviet Union will never recognize the Manchukuo puppet state. However, because of the geographical location, actual exchanges are inevitable. Regarding the negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union hopes to obtain considerable compensation before it can be transferred. The resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is a powerful guarantee for peace in the Far East."</p>
<h3 id="e140">European Countries are Preparing for War More and More Urgently <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>"In the past, all countries that recognized the League of Nations relied on the League of Nations as a guarantee to maintain world peace. However, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, European countries have felt that the power of the League of Nations is not enough to maintain world peace and feel the need for self-defense, which has led to the trend of countries preparing for war. European countries are paying close attention to the Far East, because they all firmly believe that the Far East Incident is sufficient to affect European countries."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Regret the Decline of the League of Nations' Prestige <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the situation of the League of Nations in Geneva, according to Mr. Yan, he left Geneva at the end of February last year, and it has been a year since then. The General Assembly of the League of Nations was held on January 15th, and our representative was Minister Gu Gong. He expressed regret over the decline of the League of Nations' prestige, because the decline of the League of Nations' prestige is sufficient to make international suspicions arise, and each seeks a way to deal with it, so conflicts are easy to occur. The League of Nations is a shared League of Nations of all countries, not unique to China, and the rights and obligations of all countries in the League of Nations are better than China's. If the League of Nations declares bankruptcy, the impact on all countries will also be greater than on China."</p>
<h3 id="e142">Most Countries' Economies are Declining <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>When asked by reporters about his observations during his travels in Europe in the past two years, he replied that he had been in Europe for more than two years and traveled among various countries. He felt that the current situation in Europe was very different from before. The most obvious was the decline of the economies of various countries, year after year, and its impact on the future would naturally be great. The increase in the number of unemployed people in various countries is a great crisis, which is what he has gained from his travels in Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Truth of the Independence of Southern Xinjiang is Unclear <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>When reporters asked whether the news that the so-called "independent government" was established in Kashgar, Southern Xinjiang, and Han people were expelled, which was transmitted by TASS, was true, he replied that it was not possible to determine whether this news was true, because the traffic was blocked and it was difficult to find out the truth. As for the trade agreement that the former Chairman of Xinjiang Province, Jin Shuren, had signed with the Soviet Union without authorization, it has been investigated and confirmed by former Minister Luo. This treaty was not approved by the government and was signed by Jin Shuren without authorization, so of course it is invalid.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Denies the Rumor that He Will Head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Ambassador Yan finally denied the rumor that he would head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this time, and said that the rumor that he and Ambassadors Gu and Guo had previously jointly sent a telegram to the government opposing the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement was also not true.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Yuntaishan Cave Collapsed Due to Snow Pressure <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Traffic on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is interrupted. The Longhai Railway Water and Land Joint Transportation Office of this port received an urgent telegram from Laoyao yesterday, which stated that heavy snow had fallen in Haizhou for several days and accumulated heavily. The Yuntaishan Xikou Cave suddenly collapsed on the 2nd, and the cave was submerged, interrupting traffic. How the Railway Bureau will handle it has not yet been clearly stated. As for whether there were any casualties when the cave collapsed, it was not mentioned in the telegram because it was brief. However, the tracks in the cave were crushed by the rocks, and the loss must be considerable. It may not be possible to reopen and repair it in a short period of time. The reporter has investigated the situation and recorded it as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Heavy Snow in Haizhou <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The newly opened port of Laoyao in Haizhou was opened to navigation in November last year. There are often extreme storms in the Yingyoumen channel. The wave-stopping embankment project built by the Dutch Port Authority is in active progress, and the entire project will not be completed until the autumn of this year. At that time, the impact of the waves can be reduced. From the first day of this month, the weather in Laoyao and Xinpu was extremely cold, and heavy snow fell until yesterday morning. The snow accumulated thickly everywhere, causing the water and land construction work to be stopped.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Cave Collapsed <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Yuntaishan in Laoyao is all hard stone. The Dutch Port Authority has opened a large mountain cave of one or two hundred meters in the Chenjiagang section, and the Longhai Railway has laid railway tracks to connect the train to Laoyao, connecting water and land joint transportation. At the same time, the Dutch company also excavated mountain stones and filled a long wave-stopping embankment. From the first day, the heavy snow did not stop day and night, and accumulated very deeply. The Xikou Cave of Yuntaishan collapsed suddenly on the afternoon of the second day due to the high pressure of heavy snow. The mountain collapsed and the ground collapsed, and the sound shook far and wide, and the tracks were also submerged.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Traffic Interrupted <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Laoyao New Port Joint Transportation is currently in the process of transporting large quantities of goods. Grains and other items from the northwest rely entirely on train transportation. Now that the newly opened cave in Yuntaishan has collapsed suddenly, the railway traffic to Laoyao has been interrupted. The Longhai Railway's trains cannot pass through Yuntaishan. Transportation is interrupted. The Railway Bureau has not yet had a definite solution after receiving the report.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Kong Xiangxi Went to Hangzhou Yesterday <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Met with Chairman Jiang to discuss important public matters</p>
<p>Can return to Shanghai in the middle of today or tomorrow. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, in response to Chairman Jiang's telegram invitation to discuss important public matters, Kong had originally planned to go to Hangzhou the day before yesterday, but it was temporarily suspended due to an incident. At 9:20 yesterday morning, he took a Sikorsky plane from Hongqiao Airport with one guard and flew directly to Hangzhou. His wife, Ms. Song Ailing, did not accompany him. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in the middle of today or tomorrow to plan finances.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Number of Chinese Directors in the Public Works Department <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayer Association Executive Committee</p>
<p>Resolved to negotiate for an increase</p>
<p>To make it equal to the proportion of taxes. Guowen News Agency said that the Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association held its fifth executive committee meeting at 5:00 pm yesterday. Those present were Cheng Xiechun, Xu Jiqing, Xu Wenzhao, Chu Huiseng, Sun Qiuping, Shi Zhikun, Wang Xiaolai, Cao Zhigong, Yu Zhongxian, Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Jin Zongcheng, Shen Tianxin, Gu Wensheng, Cai Qiajun, and Ma Junshuo. Those attending as observers were Chinese Director Bei Songsun, Chinese Commissioner Lin Kanghou, and Chen Jicheng, etc. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Wang Xiaolai, who reported on the resolutions of the previous session and the incoming documents from various parties, and then began to discuss. Regarding the number of Chinese directors in the Public Works Department of the Public Concession being five, it was originally a temporary measure. Moreover, the proportion of taxes paid by Chinese people was 55% in the past, and that of foreigners was 45%. According to the Public Works Department's investigation recently, the proportion of taxes paid by Chinese people has increased to 64%, and that of foreigners only accounts for 36%. Since the amount of taxes paid by Chinese people has increased, the number of Chinese directors should also be increased in proportion to this, so as not to lose the fairness of the matter. It was resolved to actively negotiate for the number of Chinese directors in the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to be increased to be equal to the proportion of taxes paid. Other proposals were also discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:30 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Two China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships Encounter Danger <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Liji and Gongping Run Aground and Damaged</p>
<p>Liji Runs Aground The Liji, a shallow-water ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which travels between Hankou and Changsha, was carrying goods to Hunan this time. When it was about to reach Xindi, the ship ran aground due to the exceptionally shallow river water. Because the ship was heavily loaded, it ran aground and could not be towed. It immediately sent an urgent telegram to Hankou to send the Liyuan to fly to the area, first loading the goods on the ship, and then towing it. According to the telegram, the Hunan waterway was also suddenly blocked, and even shallow-water ships could not pass. However, the Kuaili has arrived in Nanjing and can come to Shanghai today. The Changxing, a Sanbei ship, is still stranded in Madang and has not been towed out. Now it can only wait for the water to rise.</p>
<p>Gongping Engine Damage The Gongping of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the largest of all the ships. This time, it was transporting goods from Shanghai to Qingdao. At 2:00 pm on the 1st, it sailed out of Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 2nd, when the ship was in the middle of its journey, the ship's shaft suddenly broke and a part of the engine blades was damaged. It also encountered strong winds at sea, which was very dangerous. Yesterday morning, the shipowner sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai, reporting the broken shaft and damaged blades, making it difficult to navigate and fearing accidents. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately replied with a wireless telegram, ordering the shipowner to quickly turn around and return to Shanghai, because a part of the ship's engine blades had not been completely destroyed and could be used, so it ordered it to return to Shanghai and not go to Qingdao. It then received another telegram stating that the Gongping was already on its way back and would arrive in port today. After it arrives in Shanghai and is inspected, it will be sent to the dock for major repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Tianchu Aircraft Engine Has Been Completely Assembled <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Once test-flown, the results were quite good. The words "Tianchu Zheng" and "Tianchu Fu" are painted on the two aircraft. Tianchu Seasoning Factory invested exclusively in ordering all-metal fighter aircraft from the German Junkers Factory. The damaged parts of one aircraft were shipped from Germany to Shanghai on the 20th of last month, and were immediately assembled at the aircraft factory at Hongqiao Airport. It is now known that the various parts of the aircraft have been completely assembled. The fuselage is painted entirely gray, and the words "Tianchu Zheng Hao" are written in black paint on both wings. The Kuomintang emblem is painted on the tail. The all-metal training aircraft compensated by the Junkers Factory is steel-colored, and the words "Tianchu Fu Hao" are painted in white paint on the wings. Both of the above aircraft have been test-flown once, and the results were quite good. As for the date of the naming ceremony, Tianchu Factory has sent personnel to contact Lin Wozhang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, and it will be officially decided soon.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Two Roads Reduce Grain Transportation Costs <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Two Roads Administration received a telegram from the former Fengtian Railway Department (The Ministry, in order to relieve rural areas and regulate food supply, has specially instructed the said road to reduce grain transportation prices to the lowest possible limit, so as to provide relief and facilitate transportation), etc. Upon receipt, it was immediately forwarded to the Traffic Department to draft a plan, which was submitted by the bureau to the Ministry of Railways for approval. From February 1st, the two roads will transport grain and charge according to the fifth class, minus 15%, for a period of six months. The scope of the grain should be limited to barley, corn, miscellaneous grains (except as otherwise specified), sorghum, millet, glutinous millet (except as otherwise specified), glutinous millet, hulled millet, buckwheat, rice (except as otherwise specified), rye, wheat, and grain. However, it is found that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line transports wheat and rice (except as otherwise specified) from Wuxi to Shanghai North Station or Maigen Road.

A large steamer passed three or four feet away from the ship, and the waves crashed and hit the stern of the cargo ship, causing the stern to flood. In addition, the gale roared and blew the sails of the cargo ship sideways, so the stern sank first, and the entire ship capsized. Police Rescue After receiving the news, the water patrol police immediately drove a boat to rescue them. Three people were rescued, including ship boss Yang Huiwen, and crew members Song Ziyuan and Li Jinbiao. Two Westerners also bravely rescued three people in the water, including Wu Decai, Wang Zhaosheng, and the ship owner's wife, Yang Shi, but Yang Shi was dead when she was rescued.

<h3 id="e163">General National Currency Transformed into Ingots <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>= The Ministry of Finance Had Previously Issued Orders Prohibiting It =</p>
<p>= Unemployed Merchants Arrested for Illegally Melting =</p>
<p>Since our country implemented the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan last year, the Ministry of Finance has formally issued an order for consistent compliance. All silver furnace agencies must close down and must not melt the general national currency into ingots. Although the general silver furnace operators have argued with reason and appealed to the authorities, the result was unsuccessful. Now, unemployed silver furnace merchants Qi Chufa, Mao Zhoufu, and others have recently opened a Ruitai sign at No. 20 Yixingli, Qipu Road, specializing in melting silver, and established a workshop at No. 41 Tiantong Road. This was discovered by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and it was learned that these people violated the ministry's order and still melted the general national currency into ingots. Detective Hu Kui-sheng and Gu Lian-cheng were specially dispatched to report to the First Special District Court at around 7 p.m. the day before yesterday and signed a search warrant, which was issued to the Huisi Patrol Room in charge, and Western Inspector Bai Hua and detective Liang Yuliang were dispatched to jointly arrest five people from Shaoxing, Qian Guoxun, Zhou Huilin, Chen Jinshan, Shen Yushu, and Tong Dasheng, at No. 41 Tiantong Road, and then arrested Qi Chufa at No. 20 Yixingli, Qipu Road. However, Mao Zhoufu was not arrested. Eight hundred and seventy-nine double-corner ingots, twenty-six silver ingots, sixty-two pounds of broken silver, four iron models, two clay models, seven silver-plated gold bracelets, fifteen ear scoops, seven earrings, twenty-five rings, ten hairpins, fourteen account books, and thirteen stamps were also seized at the two locations and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. According to police lawyer Jiang Baolian, the case was requested to be postponed in order to continue the investigation. Detective Gu Lian-cheng of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also stated that the case was a secret report from the superior, stating that there were places such as Qipu Road and Tiantong Road in the Public Concession that were melting the general currency into ingots, violating the central government's order, so the patrol room was joined to arrest them. Qian Guoxun confessed that he used to be in the silver furnace industry, and this time he was hired by Qi Chufa. His salary was seven corners a day. The ingots that were seized were not melted by us, but were shipped from Fujian. We specialize in melting old-fashioned silverware jewelry from various silver shops into ingots and selling them to silver shops to make new-style jewelry for sale. Because the silverware received is of different quality, it must be melted into ingots so that the quality is equal and there is no difference. Zhou Huilin and Tong Tiansheng also confessed that they were boarding there and did not know about the rest. Chen Jinshan confessed that he was hired by Qi Chufa and his daily salary was six corners. Shen Yushu confessed that he came to Shanghai on January 27 to help Qi. Qi Chufa confessed that he and Mao Zhoufu opened a Ruitai sign at Yixingli, Qipu Road, and started business on January 1 of this year. A total of about 1,000 ingots were melted and sold to Wensheng and Laofengxiang Silver Shops to manufacture jewelry. As for the ingots that were seized, they were shipped from Fujian. Because the various silver shops in Fujian Province melted all kinds of old-style silverware and gilded jewelry into ingots, but some of them were made of copper or gold and could not be extracted, so I asked my shop to use medicine to remelt them to extract gold and copper. Regarding the national currency, if there are any that cannot be used, they are also melted, etc. Finally, Jiang Yiping, Qi's agent lawyer, stated that the case was filed by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request assistance from the patrol room, but I don't know what articles of law were cited to prosecute. The lawyer searched the criminal law and there were no explicit provisions for this kind of case, and all the people who were arrested were residents of the concession. According to the agreement, people who are innocent cannot be detained. It should be allowed to be released on bail pending further instructions. Judge Wu Tingqi reported and ordered Qi Chufa to pay a deposit of 3,000 yuan, Qian, Chen, and Shen to each pay a deposit of 500 yuan, and Zhou and Tong to each pay a deposit that can be summoned at any time to go out pending verification.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○ The relevant parts. According to the criminal law, civil servants must strictly abide by the confidentiality of their duties, and the place of office does not dare to interfere with the law. I hope you will forgive me. Sincerely, Shanghai All Sectors Aid Xu Case Committee, Lin Ji Qi, 1, 30, Directly Responder, I have received a letter from you, borrowing the judgment of age, which is a kind of inherent academic in forensic medicine. I think it is because the people of the country have shallow knowledge, and they mistakenly think that they have created it themselves. However, in today's world where science is omnipotent and theories are numerous, Mr. Yuguo's forensic medicine has always been an authority. Hope that the principles in the middle will be set aside from time to time for lectures, and the date will be communicated in advance, so that the community can be convened, and Huilin will listen to the lectures, so that the ears can be full of blessings. If the experts and scholars of the Sir can make the request in the move to enlighten the people, the feeling of giving will not only be the same as the members of the Association, but will also be a special letter of solicitation, and a reply will be made.</p>

<p>British famous educator Mr. Kangpu was hired by the Shanghai Public Works Bureau in 1904 AD to be in charge of the affairs of Huatong Public School.</p>
<p>Great contribution. After Mr. Kang returned to China last spring after his term of office expired, he saw that there were many young people from other countries who went to study in the UK, but they were often troubled by the lack of considerable guidance. It was not easy to be admitted to universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Therefore, he created a college in Lizimeng, eight miles away from London, the British capital, specifically for students to prepare for university entrance examinations. Lizimeng is located on the Thames River, which is famous for its beautiful scenery, and is very close to London's suburban parks. The location is quiet, the customs are simple, not as noisy and polluted as London's population, so it is very suitable for students to concentrate on their studies. Moreover, the living standards in the area are not as high as those in London, so the fees are very low. The monthly tuition and board is only 15 to 17 British pounds per person. Young people in our country who want to study in the UK should pay attention to it. As for the registration procedures and other details, you can contact Mr. Huang Zhuming of Huatong Public School, No. 63 Heske Road, Shanghai, to inquire and contact.</p>

He returned to China eight years ago when Xin Xin Company was founded and immediately joined the company as a supervisor. Four years ago, he was promoted to manager. Last year, after Liu Xiji passed away, Li succeeded him as general manager. He was known for his sharp determination and diligence in handling matters. The company experienced internal labor unrest four or five years ago, which Li resolved smoothly. In recent years, the business has flourished, returning to its former glory, all thanks to Li's efforts. Now, he has been assassinated, and all sectors of society are deeply saddened. It is now heard that the company's board of directors elected Li Ze yesterday to succeed as general manager. Li Ze is Minzhou's direct nephew, currently the deputy manager of the company. He previously spent many years in Hong Kong and Guangzhou engaged in banking and import-export trade. He is as astute and decisive as his uncle. Over the years, when Minzhou was away on business, Li Ze acted on his behalf, handling matters in an orderly manner and was highly valued by the directors. He is more than capable of carrying on Li's business. Deputy Manager and Treasurer Zheng Wenzhu will remain in his original position, and Tang Chengzhang has been promoted to deputy manager. Both have served department stores for many years and have extensive experience, so there will be no impact on the company's business prospects.</p>

<p>The Jin Cheng Grand Theatre, located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, was packed for three screenings yesterday. It officially started business yesterday (Saturday), showing the latest super-special production of the Lianhua Company, "Life." The film was directed by Fei Mu, the director of "City Night," and stars Ruan Lingyu, Lin Chuchu, Zheng Junli, and Li Keng. The drama has the force of a thousand-pound hammer, striking head-on, and the plot is like a ten-thousand-mile torrent, with surging waves. Yesterday, the theater was packed for three screenings, and the number of people who arrived late and could not buy tickets was several times greater than the number of audience members inside the theater. The box office success broke all records. When the show ended, the audience's praise for the theater and the film was endless. Carriages and horses continued to arrive and depart, and the crowd did not disperse for a long time.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the 18th Labor Conference, decided by the 64th UN Council, will be held on May 14 this year in Geneva. In addition to receiving a notification from the International Labor Bureau to dispatch representatives and advisors, this year, due to the election of directors at the conference, and international competition, the government has already appointed Li Pingheng, Director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry, as the government representative, and Xie Dongfa as an advisor. At the same time, Guo Shun, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry, and Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, have been notified to promptly determine the management representatives for easy dispatch. Xin Sheng News Agency reporters visited Qian Chengxu of the General Chamber of Industry yesterday to inquire about the selection of management representatives for this session, and the agenda of the conference, including the parts related to China. Qian replied that according to the written notice from the International Labor Bureau forwarded by the Ministry of Industry, the conference agenda includes seven items: (1) Reducing working hours, (2) Unemployment insurance and unemployment relief methods, (3) Rest and shift methods for glass factory workers. These three items were discussed at the 17th conference last year but were not concluded and were retained for discussion this year. As for the agenda for this session, it is (1) Preserving the original disability and death insurance rights of workers when they move from one country to another, (2) Revising the Occupational Disease Compensation Act in the convention, (3) Employing women as miners, (4) Revising the Women's Night Work Convention. The above seven items, because they are largely unrelated to the current labor and management situation and organization in China, the management side does not feel excited. Up to now, no representatives have been produced. However, an order from the Ministry was received yesterday urging action, so it cannot be delayed any longer. The matter will be discussed with the Federation of Chambers of Commerce in the next day or two. If there is a solution, people will be selected to fill the positions. As for the funding, the industrial and commercial sectors are feeling exhausted this year, which is far less easy to raise than in previous years. It is expected that the government will be requested to subsidize the funds.</p>

<p>Preparing to Negotiate the Tunan Case</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Counterclaim 74,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The entire case has been transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The China Merchants Bureau's Tunan ship was sunk by the Japanese ship Changchun Maru, resulting in heavy losses. Afterwards, the Japanese refused arbitration and filed a counterclaim. The Ministry of Transportation has instructed the Bureau to send all procedures to Beijing to prepare for negotiations with the Japanese side to pursue compensation. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e178">Japanese Side Files Counterclaim <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Bureau presented to the Ministry of Transportation for approval to submit the case of the Changchun Maru sinking the Tunan ship for arbitration, a court of arbitration was formed in Shanghai, with each party hiring a notary to investigate. The China Merchants Bureau entrusted Guwo Lawyers as representatives to contact Dalian Steampship Company, but was severely rejected. Recently, the company attributed the sinking of the Tunan ship by the Changchun Maru to the Chinese ship. Therefore, they filed a counterclaim against the China Merchants Bureau, seeking compensation for various damages and repairs to the Changchun Maru, totaling more than 73,996 yuan, and specially sent a letter from the Dalian Steampship Company to the China Merchants Bureau to collect the money.</p>

<p>On January 26, the China Merchants Bureau presented to the Ministry of Transportation, requesting the central government to promptly conduct serious negotiations with the Japanese side and order the Dalian Steampship Company to quickly compensate for all losses of the sunk Tunan ship to avoid prolonged suspension of the case. The Ministry of Transportation has reported the China Merchants Bureau and consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formally negotiate with the Japanese Embassy. The Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, stating that the case of the Japanese ship Changchun Maru sinking the Tunan ship has been consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formally negotiate with the Japanese side.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, the China Merchants Bureau complied and prepared fifteen copies of the documents related to the exchange between the two sides in the Tunan case, attached with a formal document, and submitted them to the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Red Swastika Society's Relief Measures for the Dongping Flood <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Hou Sushuang's memorandum on dredging methods. The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Main Branch of the Red Swastika Society, seeing that the flood victims in Dongping, Shandong, were still trapped, specially appealed to all sectors of Shanghai with the slogan "Save a life with five jiao," and remitted 2,000 yuan for relief, while President Xiong Xiling appealed to various charities for donations. It is heard that Hou Sushuang, president of the Jinan Red Swastika Society, sent another letter to Xiong Xiling yesterday, reporting the reasons why the floodwaters in Dongping have not receded, and proposing two relief measures, which are extremely pertinent. They are specially excerpted below to inform those who care about treating the Yellow River: (Respectfully, I just received your telegram, knowing that you have allocated one thousand yuan from your office to relieve the flood in Dongping, and then jointly with various charities, advertised for donations. I see that you deeply care about the suffering and are deeply concerned about the drowning. Under the cover of washing, I can't help but feel grateful. The water in Dongping this year was a little later than other counties, so the report to the provincial government was also later than other counties, but because it is located in a low-lying area, the water from various counties has gathered, flooding more than 4,000 hectares of fields, which are still more than a zhang deep. Therefore, the disaster areas in other places have mostly planted wheat, while Dongping is still a vast expanse of water. Even by next spring, there will be no hope of sowing. The water from the Qingyun and Yunhe rivers in Dongping has always entered the Yellow River through Qinghe Gate (the Daqing River is in the east of the city, the Yun River is in the west, and the Yellow River is in the north). This year, the Yellow River water flooded back too fiercely, and the river gate was silted up, causing it to stagnate and not flow. The area west of the city has suddenly become a wetland. Fortunately, the Qingyun and Yunhe rivers have not been in danger this year, otherwise the city would not be safe. There are nearly 200,000 flood victims. The relief funds released by various parties before amount to no more than two or three jiao per person. There are only two porridge factories, one set up by the Swastika Society in the city, and one set up by the Investigation and Release Office in Anshan Town, west of the city (15 li from the city). Now, Du Shaopeng of the Investigation and Release Office has also obtained permission to set up another one at the Daimiao (50 li west of the city). The cotton clothes distributed by various parties are in 5,000 sets, close to 6,000. This is the current relief situation. As for the water diversion methods, there are permanent and temporary ones. The permanent one is to dredge the Qingyun and Yunhe rivers, and build dikes to raise the water level, so that the Qingyun and Yunhe rivers flow to the Qinghe Gate to suppress the Yellow River, and then build a gate to control the opening and closing, so that the Yellow River will never back up. In this way, 4,000 hectares of disaster fields will be completely drained, and the areas that have accumulated water over the years will also become fertile. However, this cannot be achieved without 600,000 yuan. It is planned to appeal to various parties to gradually complete this major project. The temporary emergency relief is to excavate the Qinghe Gate, so that the current accumulated water can have a way out (Huihang recently went to the Dongping disaster area with Du Shaopeng, Zhou Baipeng, and others, so they made an equal appeal. Huihang also promised to submit a statement to the Ministry of Finance). I went to survey the siltation the other day. The highest is less than 20 li. If 2,000 to 3,000 strong men and refugees are gathered, it can be completed in one month. However, it is currently in the solid ice period. It can be started on the tenth day of the first lunar month, but earthwork requires no more than 20,000 yuan. There is already 11,000, 7,000 yuan from the Provincial Political Council, and 4,000 yuan from Qian Junren, which has not yet been allocated. If we add your donation, it will be 12,000 yuan, which is still 8,000 short. If this project is completed, 1,000 hectares of nearby fields can be drained and planted with late wheat (wheat can still be planted in February of the old calendar). This is what has been done successfully in the past few years. If 4,000 hectares can be fully harvested for half a season, it is necessary to purchase a mud-digging steamship to constantly shuttle back and forth for dredging. However, the price of this ship is quite high. The Shandong Construction Department has ordered two ships from the province's Luda Factory for dredging the Xiaozheng River, each costing 80,000 yuan (it was originally intended to borrow one from Qinghe Gate for use, but unfortunately, it could not be transported). I don't know if there are cheaper ones in the Shanghai factory. I also hope that you will take the time to inquire about it, so that we can consider purchasing it. The province government is likely to allocate these funds, but it will have to wait three months. This is the plan for this part. If the entire permanent plan is completed, the 4,000 hectares of fields will be permanently free from flooding, and two seasons can be harvested. Dongping's prosperity can be A-grade in western Shandong. Dongping City has many mountains on the east side, and the land is barren and the people are poor. The west side is purely fertile land, which has been troubled by the Qingyun and Yunhe rivers for decades. The rich have all moved and dispersed, and the common people make a living by fishing and shrimp, resulting in the name Dongping Lake. This year, it was hit by the Yellow River disaster, and the area has doubled. Therefore, 4,000 hectares of fertile fields are all at the bottom of the water. Shuangyi, no matter how difficult it is, must be thoroughly managed. However, a mosquito carrying a mountain will be crushed. I hope that all the great benefactors will pity these 200,000 disaster victims and quickly get them out of the water and fire. I cannot express my gratitude enough. I respectfully extend this to Lao and all my colleagues in Shanghai. Sushuang respectfully replies, December 13 of the Guiyou year.)</p>

<p>The Datong Music Society in this city has always been committed to promoting national music and has been established for many years. It believes that the establishment of a specialty school in the field of national music is essential for its long-term transmission. Therefore, it plans to prepare everything. It is heard that the content organization is divided into four departments: (1) Yayue Department: All music required for national ceremonies is included. (2) Yan Yue Department: All popular music and art music in society are included. (3) Vocal Music Department: All about lyrics, phonology, filling lyrics and composing music are included. (4) Zayue Department: All about local customs of various provinces, foreign countries, and dances and dramas are included. As for Western music, it is also included in the research as a reference. This move has a close relationship with our country's culture. All Chinese people should pay attention to it, and those who have the responsibility of culture should do their best to support it, so that it can be established as soon as possible, so that the opportunity for national music will not rise and fall again. As for the detailed measures of the school, it has already begun to be drafted.</p>

<p>Guangxi has been working hard on construction in recent years, so all facilities in the province have achieved remarkable results. Last year, the central government sent four representatives, including Zhang Ji, to the south, from Guangdong to Guangxi. They praised the achievements of Guangxi's construction upon their return. This time, the central government convened the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Huang Xuchu, chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, passed through Shanghai after the meeting. Electrical appliance businesses occupy an important position in construction, and the electric light bulbs and other products of the Ya Pu Er Electric Appliance Factory are widely sold in Guangxi and have an outstanding reputation. Therefore, taking the convenience of passing through Shanghai, he telegraphed the factory's general manager, Hu Xiyuan, to visit the factory at 9:00 AM on the 3rd of this month. Hu personally welcomed Huang at his residence. Huang, accompanied by Yang Chuo'an, director of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, drove to the factory, where they were warmly received by Hu Xiyuan and Xie Li Feng Jiazheng. Then they visited the glass bulb factories and other important parts. Because Huang had other appointments, he could not stay longer. Therefore, the factory's electric fan manufacturing factory on Poyang Road was not visited. Huang praised all the facilities of the factory and personally wrote "Promote National Glory" on the comment book. He talked with Hu and Feng for a while, had some refreshments, took a photo, and returned.</p>

It is scheduled to start school in late February. Currently, applicants are coming one after another. Registration will be stopped when the quota is full. It is also heard that Yan will return to Shaanxi after this graduation, and it is difficult to predict whether he will continue to teach in the future. Those who are interested in learning should go to No. 63 Pushi Road to register as soon as possible to avoid missing this good opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Continued Hearing of the Talc Counterfeit Case <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Cao Hongzhang, currently residing at No. 6, Zishou Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, had a late father, Peisheng, who opened the Guangdong Lao Guangfeng Talc Powder Company in Jiuru Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei in the ninth year of the Republic of China. The business was quite developed. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Xu Chengxun, who was running Tongrenhe Company on Min Guo Road, saw that the business was good, so he also used the Guangfeng brand in the store to sell talc powder, which greatly affected the talc powder business run by Cao Peisheng. In February of last year, Peisheng died of illness. When Hongzhang inherited the business, he applied to the Social Affairs Bureau and forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry for registration, and received the Commercial Character No. 4833 license as proof, to prevent counterfeiting. Xu Chengxun learned that Cao Hongzhang had obtained a license, and also used the Guangdong Lao Guangfeng Talc Powder brand as a trademark to register with the Trademark Bureau and apply for a license. Cao learned about it and intended to sue him, but Xu first detained the talc powder purchased by Cao Hongzhang's customer, Wang Shaoqing, and designated it as counterfeit. Therefore, Cao Hongzhang hired lawyer Ni Jiong to sue Xu in the Second Court of the Special Zone for the crime of trademark counterfeiting. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Sun Peng heard the case in the Second Court. After the plaintiff Cao Hongzhang stated the above situation, the defendant's side, Yan Feiguo, came to court to defend. Because evidence still needs to be investigated, the court ordered a continuation of the hearing on February 15.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Rapid Progress of the Shen Yi Rubber Band Factory <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Rubber bands are a necessity for factories, and the annual leakage of funds is very large, especially from Japanese goods. In view of this, Ningbo merchants Mu Zixiang, Liu Qingyun, Mu Mingsan, and Mu Yunwu, who live in Shanghai, have spent several years planning and investigating, and gathered huge sums of money to create the Shen Yi Rubber Band Factory at the end of Huishan Road in this city. The factory is purely Chinese capital, Chinese technicians, and Chinese raw materials (supplied by the Chinese National Canvas Factory). It has already manufactured goods last year. The quality is firm and sturdy, and it has been welcomed by various factories, who have adopted it one after another. Recently, the factory has also taken into account the large-scale sale of enemy goods, so it has been improving the quality of its goods and lowering prices as much as possible, far exceeding imported goods, and can guarantee the use of its products. What is particularly characteristic is that if various factories have any special application for any type of tape with special sizes, lengths, thicknesses, they can accept customized orders and deliver them within 24 hours, and guarantee the application. The price of the order is also very low, which foreign goods cannot match. All national goods factories, since there are national goods rubber bands that can be used, should no longer need foreign goods, which is also a major move to stop the leakage of funds. The factory also welcomes people from all walks of life to visit at any time and can contact Mr. Mu Yunwu.</p>

<p>In January of the 23rd year, the Shanghai Pushan Villa collected and buried 78 large coffins and 2,586 small coffins in both the North and South Chinese Concessions, and distributed 1,376 large and small coffins. This included 13 large coffins and 1,375 small coffins collected by the villa, as well as 567 small coffins collected by the Xieqiao Branch and various charity halls in the French Concession, and 55 large coffins and 633 small coffins collected from the police stations and health departments in the Public Concession, discarded children's corpses, and unclaimed corpses from various hospitals at the autopsy site. Also, 2 large coffins were collected from Tongren Hospital, 4 large coffins and 11 small coffins were collected from the Lianyishan Society, and 4 coffins were collected from various hospitals of the Red Cross. The above corpses were all collected by the villa's vehicles, transported to the righteous place for burial, and marked for collection. The Xinmin Road White Cross Pushan Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital provided medical treatment and medicine for a total of 3,227 people.</p>

<p>The principal and interest of the treasury bonds are repaid monthly, and the face value is different each month. The calculation of the combined interest is not only different in method, but also cumbersome. When the market price is lower than the face value, the benefits that the bondholder should get are not only the monthly interest increase, but also the proportional increase in the difference between the face value and the market price. Now, Mr. Zhou has calculated the recognized method into a table in his spare time. Within the range of 20 yuan market price, you can find out the combined interest immediately. It was published last year, and readers found it convenient. This year's twelve large sheets have also been published. The entire set is only sold for one yuan. The Shanghai Bank Trust Department and China Travel Service are selling it on a voluntary basis. The proceeds from this sale will be entirely used for rural hospital expenses.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, After reading the news item in your newspaper's local news column on the 2nd of this month regarding the misuse of the talcum powder brand name, I found that many of the contents were inaccurate. Our company has been promoting Guangfeng talcum powder for over ten years. This talcum powder is produced by Guangdong's Lao Guangfeng Company, which has long applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration and has its distribution office located on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei. The Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly verified that the inventory is piled up, so how can it be said that the company name is fictitious? The so-called past event of apologizing in the newspaper last year was done by Wang She Sheng, a former partner of our company. Our company acted out of compassion and took the blame for others. Wang She Sheng published a statement in the newspaper and also wrote a written statement, which has nothing to do with the Guangfeng Talcum Powder Company, which has been in operation for many years. The details reported are inaccurate according to the interview. The two parties are now in court, and the truth will eventually come to light. We are afraid that misinformation will spread and confuse the public, so we are writing to request that you investigate and correct the report. Sincerely, Shen Taiyuan Company, February 4th.</p>
<p>=Lost and Found= If there are any lost men or women, please pay attention to this notice from the Social Affairs Bureau, No. 2253, Female, Wang Xiaomei, from Jiangxi, 9 years old, June 30, 1933, sent by the Second Special District Court to the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association for care.

<h3 id="e196">Reading Q&amp;A <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The Seriousness of Reading</p>
<p>Reading Guidance: New literature is a sharp blade, capable of powerfully piercing the paralyzed hearts of mankind; it is a loud bell, capable of awakening mankind from cruel dreams; it is... of course, the effect of new literature is not just so simple. I am just writing two examples according to what I feel.</p>
<p>However, based on the feeling of just a portion of this, this feeling, permeated into my heart, and after being burned by the flames of my youth, it further recalled the disillusionment of past happiness (reading), causing various sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy tastes in my heart, and increased my faith in new literature and my ambition for creation.</p>
<p>But, I am a person who dropped out of school after graduating from elementary school. With such a naive level of Chinese studies, harboring such great wishes, and at the same time facing the current restrictive situation, although the future can always be freed from, comparing the unknowable results of future efforts with the emptiness of the past and present, truly makes me feel somewhat lost. In the difficult and irregular self-study, vagueness often floats in my mind.</p>
<p>In the past self-study, I only kept reading literary novels, recognizing some unfamiliar words, and sometimes I was even too lazy to look up the words. Places that I could not understand (such as foreign literary allusions that are too profound and humorous) had no one to ask. Just like this, just like this, time flew by, age increased, and what about the results of self-study? Emptiness, vagueness.</p>
<p>Therefore, my future, I hope my future, can have a more regular and faster effect than the past.</p>
<p>However, what regular plan do I have now besides reading literature and recognizing words? What faster plan? Ah! This is not an outburst of malicious dependence, it is really something that my brain, which lacks intelligence and is slow, cannot think of!</p>
<p>Reading Guidance, I can only ask you for practical enlightenment. (Letter from Zhou Yun)</p>
<p>We have received many letters like Mr. Zhou's. Although the content is inevitably somewhat empty, and what they yearn for is only a vague hope, it really leaves us with no way to give a specific answer. However, we still feel that this kind of communication is also very important, because this is precisely a kind of problem that friends who casually (play) with literature are most prone to making. Many friends, because of the bitterness of life or temporarily for the sake of bored feelings, mostly use novels and poems to relieve boredom and dispel worries. Some people even completely hold a recreational attitude, all lacking a kind of research (seriousness). Therefore, most are satisfied with (liking to read without seeking thorough understanding), casually playing with it, just like watching a movie, without trying to understand the essence within this exquisite work of art. Like this, reading again and again, although the number of books increases day by day, they have failed to have a deep understanding of any one school of works, or any one author. What remains in the mind is a layer of hazy impression; and their own emotions cannot come into contact with the lofty emotions of the author, so they cannot receive a response from the heart and obtain a spiritual connection. Only looking at the factual structure of the story is easy to make the spirit dissipate and the interest diminish. Therefore, the result of lacking (research seriousness) is often as tasteless as (beer that has lost its fizz).</p>
<p>After this kind of reading attitude is formed, it is very difficult to change. Generally, young people who are unwilling to endure this kind of bitterness then doubt their own (intelligence), or (brain) is inferior to others, and shout out (emptiness) (vagueness). Pessimistic people think that they can do nothing, so they (just muddle along); more courageous people want to come up with some hope, but what they propose is nothing more than (what regular plan?), like Mr. Zhou. Naturally, we sympathize with this kind of reader very much.</p>
<p>What we hope is that Mr. Zhou and friends who have the same problem will first change their attitude of (reading literature), and further embrace a serious research mind, earnestly treating it as a difficult subject to study.</p>
<p>Generally, people who are truly worthy of admiration cannot know their greatness all at once, but will gradually understand their special qualities. It is the same with literature. Truly worthy of reading, high-level works are not necessarily as sweet as honey, as fragrant as osmanthus, and extremely easy to attract people to read. It may often have some bitter taste, or at first glance, it is actually a dry and tasteless story. Readers who savor these works must not only pay close attention, but also have some preliminary knowledge. Otherwise, it will be truly more difficult to directly experience the content of the work than (threading a thick thread through the eye of a needle).</p>
<p>(Close attention) can be cultivated through learning, but preliminary knowledge is increased through one's own knowledge. Regarding the latter, readers should have considerable knowledge of social sciences to lay the foundation for researching literary theory. At the same time, devote some energy to literary theory. (Theory) is the key to opening the door of works.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou! Your reading plan, because we do not know your life, cannot make it for you. This is your own business. We can only provide you with some advice for your reference. But we currently hope that you will embrace a serious attitude and then study literary theory. Your writing is quite impressive, and your brain is not slow. According to us, you have quite a literary future, so don't be discouraged and move forward! As for how to learn theory, it also depends on your level and cannot be answered here. Fortunately, this department is currently drafting a book on how to learn literature on your own, which will be published soon. Perhaps that booklet can provide you with some hints. However, before it is published, temporarily introduce Qian Qian Wu's "How to Study Emerging Literature?" for you to consult first.</p>
<p>In the future, we also hope that Mr. Zhou and readers who generally have the same feelings as Mr. Zhou can raise some more specific questions, such as (foreign literary allusions, overly profound meanings, humor), etc. for research. We will do our best to answer them.</p>

<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>Learning is unclear without asking. Learning and asking, learning more and asking more, that's how you get knowledge.</p>
<p>What to learn? Learn the principles of being a person, dealing with social situations, and handling human affairs. Learn the tricks of science, conquer nature, and utilize resources for the benefit of life. Learn to strive for peace and save China. Learn to take on major responsibilities and be a person beneficial to society.</p>
<p>Ask whom? Ask dad, ask mom, ask teachers, ask classmates, ask books, ask the laboratory. Ask heaven, ask earth, ask every stone and tree, ask every flower and leaf, ask every planet, ask every drop of water. Ask the old farmer who plants the fields, ask the miner who digs the soil, ask the merchant who does business, ask the technician who creates tools, ask the warrior who defends the country. Ask all people, things, and objects.</p>
<p>Learning allows you to know the inevitable phenomena of things. Asking allows you to know the reasons behind things. Only by learning and asking at the same time can you understand everything among the myriad things!</p>

<p>— Shu</p>
<p>There is a dam on Hangzhou's West Lake called Su Causeway. This dam has a history. Originally, there was a famous literary figure in the Song Dynasty named Su Dongpo. He served as an official in Hangzhou. Before he became an official, there was no Su Causeway on West Lake. However, a huge, strange wind often blew down from the mountains on the lake shore, often capsizing the small boats on the lake. When Su Dongpo became an official, he was often worried about this, but he couldn't think of a good solution. But one day, while he was drinking tea, he blew on the tea because it was hot. The single tea stalk floating on the water surface also rose and fell with the waves, but still didn't sink. Su Dongpo suddenly had an idea. He ordered a long dam to be built on the part of the lake where the small boats were being capsized. After that, the situation of boats capsizing indeed disappeared. The dam was then called Su Causeway.</p>

<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>The Man and the Lion</p>
<p>Once a lion and a man were walking together on the road, they were both telling stories about themselves as great. After walking for a while, they gradually approached the stone statue beside the road. When they got closer, they took a careful look, and it was a stone statue of a man and a lion. The man's hand was gripping the lion's throat. The man pointed to the statue and said to the lion:</p>
<p>(There! Look, how much stronger we are than you! We are the masters of the animals.) But the lion quickly replied: (This thing was made by you, so it was made like this: if the lions also knew how to carve stone statues, then you would see a stone statue of a lion stretching out its palm and grabbing the man's neck.)</p>
<p>The Farmer and the Crane</p>
<p>A farmer spread a net in his field to catch the storks that often came to steal grain. Several storks were caught by him, including a crane. This crane was lame and begged the farmer to release it.</p>
<p>(I am not a stork,) it said. (I am a crane. I am a good bird that knows how to take care of my parents. Please look at the color of the feathers on my body. It's not like the color of the feathers on a stork's body.)</p>
<p>But the farmer said: (I don't know whether the color of the feathers is the same or not. I only know that if you are caught with the storks, you can only be executed with the storks.)</p>
<p>This is to teach us not to befriend bad people. If we befriend bad people, we will be in danger of falling into a trap.</p>

<p>— Jin Si Liang</p>
<p>Ming'er suddenly thought of a question: (Why do everyone wear white clothes in summer, but no one wears them in winter?) He couldn't solve it, so he went to ask his uncle.</p>
<p>His uncle said to him: (When it snows and the snow on the ground is about to melt, use a sheet of white paper and a sheet of black paper, put them on the snow, and ask the sun this question. The sun can answer you.)</p>
<p>Ming'er was very surprised when he heard his uncle's words. He thought, the sun is high in the sky, how can I go up and ask him? It doesn't have feet and mouth, and it certainly won't come down to tell me. I really don't understand my uncle's words.</p>
<p>Although he was very suspicious in his heart, one day, he saw it was snowing and was very happy. After one night, the snow stopped, and the sky cleared up, and the snow on the ground was about to melt. He took out the prepared white paper and black paper and put them on the snow, following his uncle's words. He stood beside them and watched.</p>
<p>He watched for about two hours and understood. He thought, my uncle didn't deceive me; the sun can indeed tell me.</p>
<p>It turned out that after he stood and watched the two pieces of paper for more than two hours, he suddenly discovered that the snow under the black paper melted faster than the snow under the white paper. He thought again, and knew that white things don't absorb heat as well as black things; so in the summer, everyone wears white clothes and white hats so that the heat of the sunlight doesn't shine too intensely on the human body, and the human body can be cooler.</p>
<p>He ran to his uncle happily and said: (Uncle! The sun is really willing to tell people; I understand now.) His uncle smiled at him and said: (Good boy, you are really smart!)</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Progress of Lamps - From Firewood to Electric Lights <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— He Gong Chao</p>
<p>People in ancient times were very afraid of darkness: when the sun went down and the ground was pitch black, their hearts were filled with panic. Even today, the savages in Africa are more afraid of darkness than anything else. Because at night, all kinds of lurking beasts come out; all kinds of dangers surround them. How happy they are to have light. But no matter how much they fear darkness, darkness will eventually come every day. Later, humans came up with a way to get light: they discovered that burning firewood not only provided warmth, but also light. Later, when they were walking, they took a branch from the firewood pile and held it in their hands to light the path. This was the torch. They also discovered that animal oil could be burned, so they made torches and candles. They also invented oil lamps, which were first made of shells and stones, and later of pottery and copper. The wicks of these lamps were made of rush. There were many styles of oil lamps, including hanging lamps suspended by ropes and upright column lamps. There were also several kinds of utensils for placing candles, such as candle plates, candle picks, candle stands, and candle clusters. Rush lamps were made by soaking rush in oil. In the eighteenth century, the Swiss invented the kerosene lamp, which was a major advancement in lamps. Because it had a glass cover, it could stabilize the light, unlike the old-fashioned oil lamps that flickered. As science developed, the progress of lamps became faster. Gas lamps were invented in 1792. Thomas Edison invented the electric light in 1879. As for gauze lamps, arc lamps, floodlights, and searchlights, they were all invented in modern times. They emit such a large amount of light and shine such a long way, that ancient humans would never have dreamed of it.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Thinking <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— An Fu</p>
<p>Dear children! When you are at home, at school, on the street: aren't there many strange things that you can see? But I know that after you see these strange things, don't you want to run to your mom or dad and ask them? Children! If so, that's wrong.</p>
<p>We should know that after seeing a strange thing, you shouldn't ask first, you should think first. If you can't think it out, think again: think about whether your mom and dad have told you, whether you have read it in a book. If you really can't think it out, then go ask your mom and dad. After they tell you, you should think again, are they right? If they are wrong, then think again and ask again, that's right!</p>
<p>Because, children! You should know that no matter what you do in the world, if you think about it a little more, it won't be easy to forget. Children! Remember this! Think first, then ask.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Compassionate Siamese Children <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>In Siamese customs, the people believe in the king as if he were a god or Buddha. Therefore, no matter what the status of the person, they must become a monk and convert to Buddhism once. If they have not undergone the ritual of conversion, they will be spurned by society and not recognized as human beings. The ritual of conversion, in addition to chanting scriptures, also requires begging for food every morning. When converting, whether princes and grandsons or the children of noble families, they all practice together with the children of poor people, regardless of wealth or status, completely treated the same, without distinction between high and low. If the poor children knock on gongs and stand at people's doors, then any family will definitely take food and dishes to give to these children. This is because the Siamese people, who believe in Buddhism and have a deep sense of compassion, treat everyone equally, so there are no beggars or thieves in Siam. More than ten years ago, a friend who visited Siam returned and told a strange story. One day, he was playing outside Bangkok when three children suddenly came. He thought they were beggars and gave them some bread and fruit. The children sincerely prayed to the west for a while, thanked him, and left. Later, he heard someone next to him say: they were originally very pitiful orphans, raised by the children of nearby families who pooled their resources. After a month, the Siamese king heard this news and felt very pity. He also took out a sum of money to help the nearby families raise those three children. It is said that all three children are diligent in their studies and are now pillars of Siam. Therefore, Siam, which believes in Buddhism and has cultivated a heart of compassion and love since childhood, can be said to be governed by Buddhism. Their country can be peaceful and free from theft and beggars because their people are rich in charity.</p>

<p>— Jian Fen</p>
<p>Pen Holder Mouth In such a cold winter, when you just pick up a writing brush (or other brushes) to write, do you feel that the (pen holder) is as cold as ice? If we want to put on gloves to hold the (pen holder), then it's not convenient to write. Is there no way to deal with the (pen holder) being cold? No! Just use a (fine velvet thread) (the finer the better) to evenly wrap the part of the (pen holder) that you hold. In this way, the very cold (bamboo pen holder) (or other pen holders) becomes a (velvet pen holder). Later, when you hold the pen, the (pen holder) won't be as cold as it used to be.</p>
<p>(Attached note) In the summer, if your hands sweat, won't it be very slippery to pick up the (pen holder)? You can also use this method; but it's best to change to using (silk thread) to wrap it. Later, when you hold the (pen holder) with sweaty hands, it won't be slippery.</p>
<p>Inkstone Mouth When the weather is very cold, problems arise when grinding ink; because the (inkstone water) is affected by the cold air and will freeze. Now there is a very common method that can prevent the (inkstone water) from freezing; many people know this method, but there are also people who don't know it. Now it is written below for public announcement: that is, first put half a pot of (water), and then add half a pot of (sorghum liquor): | ordinary hotels have it for sale, at this time the (water in the ink pot) will not freeze.</p>
<p>(Attached note) Children: Isn't the (inkstone water) used every day? The (pour liquor) will also be used every day. If you have to buy liquor every day, isn't it a very troublesome and expensive thing? No! You only need to use the bottle that you usually use to hold water to store (liquor); when you use it, pour out a little, and when you don't use it, tighten the (bottle stopper); it won't be troublesome and it won't be expensive.</p>

<p>Little Mouse Longtail had never ventured out to play since he was born. Today, the weather was beautiful, and his mother told him to go out for a trip to broaden his horizons. Soon, he ran back. His mother asked him, "What did you see outside today?" "I saw many, many things I had never seen before," Longtail replied. "When I was coming home, I saw a round-faced, round-eyed old man with a beard, wearing a black and white patchwork fur coat, meowing softly, seeming very friendly. I was just about to run over and play with him when a tall fellow with two legs and a red hat suddenly crowed loudly. I was so scared that I rushed home. That bearded uncle even followed me to the door, meowing for me to come out and play."</p>
<p>His mother said, "The one crowing 'ooh-ooh' is Mr. Rooster, and he is very kind. That friendly-looking bearded uncle is our great enemy, Mr. Cat!"</p>
<p>Our enemies often wear a friendly face, meowing very kindly.</p>

<p>Love is a bright red flower. When it is in full bloom, you feel as if you are lying on a green lawn, on a bright spring morning: the sun warmly bathes you, the wind gently kisses you; flowers smile, insects buzz; dew is sweet, springs are clear: everything is sweet.</p>
<p>But if one day this red flower withers, then your father will not even glance at you, your mother will not even turn her head to you, your brother will fight with you, your sister will scold you, what a state your family will be in? And how painful will your life be?</p>
<p>Children, in your pure hearts, sincerely cherish this beautiful flower; love your home, your society, your country, and even the whole world! Pour your hot blood to irrigate it, and never let it wither!</p>

<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>We know that owls are among the fiercest of birds; but they can only come out in the dark night, dashing about and insulting their kind; if the sun comes out, they hide motionless in their nests. At that time, even a small sparrow can bully them, and they cannot resist. Children! Do you want to know the reason? Let me tell you!</p>
<p>It turns out that owls love to reverse day and night. Since they hatched, they have loved sleeping during the day and going out at night. Over time, their eyes have become ineffective during the day. Dear children! Are you willing to be unable to open your eyes during the day and be bullied by others? If you don't want to, then I advise you to quickly develop the habit of going to bed early and getting up early!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Why Do Moving Pictures Move? <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>In the movie theater, Ling'er twisted her mother and asked, "Mom! Why do the figures on the white wall move?" Her mother said, "Good child! You asked a very interesting question; but it can't be explained in just a few words. Let's go home, and I'll explain it to you slowly!"</p>
<p>In the evening, after her mother had finished everything, she took Ling'er's hand and said, "I can now explain the question you asked in the movie theater during the day; but just explaining is not enough, unless there is a practical experiment." She frowned for a moment, then suddenly said as if she had an idea, "I've got it!" As she spoke, she found a round tin biscuit can, drilled a small hole in the center of the bottom, threaded a string through it, ready to hang it in the air. (As in picture one) She also dug several larger holes in the bottom (as in picture two) to allow sufficient light inside. Around the can, she also dug twenty or thirty rectangular slits (as in picture three). These were the split flaps to control the light. Then, she folded the edge of the can's opening inward by about two-thirds (as in picture four) to secure the pictures so they wouldn't fall out. After her mother had prepared the can, she cut out several pieces of paper of the same size, drew pictures of running postures in a continuous motion, and placed them in the folded part under the slits inside the can.</p>
<p>After her mother had prepared everything, she hung the can under the electric light and started to spin it. Strangely enough, when Ling'er looked through the slits, she felt that the pictures inside suddenly moved, almost like the moving pictures in the movie theater just now.</p>
<p>At that time, her mother said to Ling'er, "Because human eyes, when they see something, do not immediately lose the shape of that thing; there is a persistence of at least one-tenth of a second. Therefore, whenever an action has not completely disappeared, another continuous action is constantly added, in the minds of people, it seems to have become a continuous action. The inventor of movies used this principle to continuously rotate a roll of continuously photographed film; and applied a projector to project the images, so the images we see in the movie theater can move freely, just like real people!"</p>

<h3 id="e212">Overview of Education in Zhejiang Province (II) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Summary of Minister of Education Inspector Dai Xia's Two Lectures (IV) Regarding Secondary Education: The most developed secondary education in the province is general secondary schools, with a total of eighty-three schools (including thirteen provincial ones). There are only twelve normal schools (including five provincial ones), and another eighteen normal lecture classes that have not yet concluded. There are also only nineteen vocational schools (including two run by Zhejiang University and two provincial ones). Therefore, the provincial education funds are mostly allocated to general secondary schools, accounting for 63% of the total secondary education funds. The remaining 21% goes to vocational education and 16% to normal education. According to the Ministry's standards (stipulating that by the 26th year of the Republic, secondary schools should account for 40%, vocational schools for 35%, and normal schools for 25%), vocational education is still 14% short, normal education is 9% short, and secondary education is 23% over. It is now planned to gradually establish one provincial senior agricultural vocational school, three junior agricultural vocational schools, one senior industrial vocational school, two junior industrial vocational schools, and one commercial vocational school within five years, so that the percentage of funds allocated to vocational education will reach 35% by the 26th year. The same applies to normal education, with plans to establish two provincial normal schools, four rural normal schools, and seven simplified normal departments within five years, so that their funding will reach 25% by the 26th year. As for the general secondary schools in the province, apart from girls' secondary schools, junior high schools are established in the old prefectural city areas and senior high schools in the old Taoist regions. Their establishment is quite uniform and meets the needs. Currently, it is planned to maintain the status quo temporarily, with no further increase or slight reduction in funding, so that it becomes 40% by the 26th year. As for the secondary education funding situation in counties and cities, the funding for general secondary schools also accounts for a particularly large proportion, about 74% of the total. Vocational education funding accounts for about 14%, and normal education funding accounts for about 12%. It is now planned to order five general secondary schools to be converted into junior agricultural schools, and it is also planned that all newly established schools in the future will be run as junior agricultural or junior industrial vocational schools, and normal schools or simplified normal schools will be established at any time, so that they meet the Ministry's standards by the 26th year. Private secondary schools are mostly general schools. It is planned to investigate the existing private secondary schools to see which ones are suitable for setting up vocational schools, or whether the number of equivalent schools in the local area is sufficient to accommodate secondary school students, and whether the equipment and funding of the private secondary schools are relatively sufficient and complete. They will be urged to convert into agricultural or industrial vocational schools. For newly established private secondary schools in the future, they will all be required to open agricultural or industrial vocational schools. Since the implementation of co-education for boys and girls in the province in the 16th year of the Republic, girls have had more opportunities to enroll, and their numbers have greatly increased. Currently, most schools above secondary level accept both boys and girls. In addition, there are thirty-five public and private girls' secondary schools that are set up separately. However, in recent years, the number of female students has been increasing year by year, and there is a great shortage of accommodation. The provincial treasury is in financial straits, and adding more girls' schools is not allowed by the facts. It is now planned to add one provincial girls' secondary school, and take back one county-run girls' simplified normal school to be run by the province. At the same time, the number of female students enrolled in provincial junior high schools will be expanded, and classes will be taught separately. The existing public and private girls' secondary schools will be reorganized or expanded to provide relief. The performance of the provincial secondary schools is generally satisfactory. The results of the examinations, except for one junior high school with relatively poor results, show that the number of graduates is more than 90% of the actual number of attendees. More than half of the senior high school graduates are admitted to schools above junior college level. As for county, city, and joint secondary schools, except for a few, the level has not been improved due to factors such as funding, faculty, and equipment, and the results are poor. There are also not many private secondary schools that are excellent. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e226">Dongwu Night School Submits a Request to the Ministry of Education to Continue Operations <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Education issued an order for five schools in this city, including Dongwu, Chizhi, Hujiang, and Fazheng, to discontinue their night schools, each school has now decided not to admit new students. However, the methods of closure vary. The Fazheng School authorities plan to convene a meeting of representatives from each school to discuss response strategies. The Shen Shi News reporter met with Ren Qun, the chairman of the student union of the Dongwu Law School, yesterday to inquire about everything in detail. According to him, the regulations of Dongwu and other night schools stipulate that those applying to the night school must have a bachelor's degree from a national or officially registered private university. Therefore, all night school students have completed military training early in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations. Even those who already have doctoral or master's degrees in other fields must study for a full three years before graduating. Thus, anyone who obtains a law degree from the night school must have undergone at least seven years of university education. Moreover, the curriculum is well-designed, no different from the night schools established by New York University and Northwestern University in the United States. In addition to domestic law, the curriculum also includes the laws of countries such as England, America, Japan, Germany, and Italy for reference and comparison. The examination regulations adopt the system of Cambridge University in England, which is a first in the country. A strict approach is always adopted. Any student who is absent for more than 30 hours per semester will not receive full credit for all courses. Therefore, all students are diligent and hardworking. Recently, the school launched a large-scale fundraising campaign to build the most comprehensive law library in East Asia with 300,000 yuan, so that domestic scholars can observe and learn. It is heard that most of the total funds have been raised, and construction may begin next semester. Furthermore, graduates of the night school over the years have been highly regarded by society, and various universities in Europe and America can formally recognize them. If they go abroad for further study for one year, they will be granted a doctoral degree. The Shen Shi News reporter inquired with the school authorities about future plans. According to them, the school does not typically enroll students during the winter vacation. The school is not participating in the meeting of representatives from various schools convened by Fazheng. They are currently submitting a report to the Ministry of Education, stating that the establishment of the night school does not violate the Ministry's regulations and requesting that it be allowed to continue operating.</p>

<p>The Donghua Club Temporarily Forfeits</p>
<p>Failing to Prepare in Advance, Disappointing Fans' Round Trips</p>
<p>Acting Carelessly, Reputation Ruined in One Day ▲ Jinan Loses to the Western Merchants ▲ Huacesi Defeats Youyou Yesterday, a very unusual event occurred in the Western Union Football League's Group A match, namely, Donghua's failure to appear for their match against the French Merchants, leaving thousands of fans wandering back and forth on Laozhaobang Road. The situation was met with much criticism and complaints. Since Donghua's Li Ning and Wan Xianghua were unable to play, they failed to plan for any remedies beforehand. Even if there were no substitutes, they should have announced it in advance. This forfeiture has inevitably tarnished Donghua's reputation. Jinan, due to its key players returning home for the winter vacation, fielded players from the B team yesterday and lost to the Western Merchants by a score of 1-3. Huacesi was relentless, defeating Youyou by a score of 10-2. The Western Police defeated the Navy 3-0. It is hoped that the authorities of the three struggling Chinese teams will strive to rejuvenate them. The records of each team and the conditions of yesterday's matches are described below:</p>

<h3 id="e228">The Truth About Donghua Club's Withdrawal from the War <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Li Ning is Penalized, and the Sports Association Does Not Protest on Their Behalf</p>
<p>Failing to Announce It the Night Before is Like Intentionally Sabotaging</p>
<p>Going Against the Press is a Poor Strategy for the Team Donghua Club's temporary absence from the baseball field for the match against the French Merchants has sparked criticism from many quarters. Indeed, given Donghua's status and reputation, it seems inappropriate to engage in such a frivolous act. Donghua certainly has its own grievances and reasons, but whether it can gain forgiveness from the outside world remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Great Disappointment Due to the French Merchants' recent two defeats, yesterday's match against Donghua was considered a great opportunity for Donghua to contend for supremacy. Fans were enthusiastic, but finding the doors closed upon arrival was truly disappointing. Donghua's absence is said to be due to Li Ning's suspension and Wan Xianghua's absence due to his expedition to the north, resulting in an insufficient number of players. However, why not plan ahead and avoid a last-minute change of plans? The strangest thing is that Donghua informed the Western newspapers of its inability to attend in advance. When Chinese newspaper reporters inquired about the lineup the night before, they were neither informed of who would replace Li and Wan nor given any indication that they would be unable to attend. This is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>No One in Charge According to Zhou Jiaqi, an official of the Sports Advancement Association, after seeing a Western newspaper report at 8:30 a.m. that Donghua might not be able to attend, he rushed to Donghua to inquire about the truth. He first asked the team captain, Tu Kaiyuan, who said that he only knew about selecting the field and other matters and knew nothing else. He then asked the administrator, Lu Zhong'en, who replied that he did not know. Thus, there was no indication whether the team would attend.</p>
<p>When asked again at 10:30 a.m., there was still no result. It was not until around 11:00 a.m. that Lu Zhong'en replied that there was no one available and that a decision could not be made until 3:00 p.m. Later, at 2:35 p.m., the official reply from Lu Zhong'en of the club was finally received, stating that they had decided not to attend.</p>
<p>Strange</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a statement from a Donghua spokesperson, Li Ning was penalized for two weeks for representing the Chinese team in the International Football Tournament. Donghua was dissatisfied and requested an appeal, but since Li represented the Chinese team, the appeal had to be made by the Chinese team. Donghua then requested the Sports Advancement Association to protest on their behalf, but the Sports Advancement Association did not immediately do so, leading to dissatisfaction. The team also asked the Western Union that night whether the date could be changed, but the Western Union secretary stated that the schedule had already been arranged and could not be changed at the last minute, so the match had to be played. Donghua then decided not to attend, but when Chinese newspaper reporters inquired the night before, they did not directly inform them of their inability to attend and instead informed the Western newspapers. Furthermore, until 2:00 p.m. yesterday, when the Sports Advancement Association inquired whether they would attend, they consistently refused to reveal the truth until 2:35 p.m., which was tantamount to intentionally making things difficult for the Chinese newspapers and the Sports Advancement Association. It is believed that Donghua should not have done this.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Jinan Loses to the Western Merchants in an Upset <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Old Generals Return Home, Forcing a Makeshift Team</p>
<p>Mei Hongbao Acts as Goalkeeper</p>
<p>Leading by One Goal Before Conceding Three Since the key players of the Jinan Football Team, such as Xu Heng, Gu Shangxiong, and Chen Zhenxiang, returned home for the winter vacation, their strength has been greatly reduced. Recently, Xu Yahui and others have also returned home. Therefore, in yesterday's match against the Western Merchants at Yiyuan, they used players from the B team and formed a makeshift team. Mei Hongbao played as a guest goalkeeper, and Luo Haiguang retreated to play defense. The situation was lackluster, and the interest was reduced. Although Jinan scored first within five minutes of the start, they ultimately lost 1-3.</p>
<p>Opening the Scoring</p>
<p>The young players of Jinan were indeed spirited and showed no weakness. Within five minutes, they scored the first goal. The goal was scored when center Chen Bin dribbled the ball forward, dribbled past the Western Merchant's Hou Faping, and goalkeeper Godekin rushed out to intercept the ball, missing completely. The ball landed on the goal line, and Qiu Zhen'an rushed up and put it in, opening the scoring. After the Western Merchants kicked off, their left wing went deep and passed the ball to the front of the goal. The Jinan defender missed, and Mei Hongbao also failed to catch it. In the blink of an eye, the ball was at the right corner of the goal, less than a yard from the goal. The Western Merchant's right wing, Atai, rushed to the spot and was about to score, but he was too hasty and shot the ball wide, causing the spectators to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Losing Again and Again, the Situation Becomes Dull Around half an hour later, the Western Merchant's Stoke sent the ball from the center to the right. Right wing Atai broke through two defenders and crossed the ball from the baseline. The Jinan defender could not get back in time, and Haitley had already chased to the goal, taking advantage of the situation to poke the ball in. Mei Hongbao was caught off guard, and the goal was conceded. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. After the start of the second half, the Western Merchants' momentum suddenly increased, and their attack was extremely fierce. Jinan was busy defending and had no time to attack. Although Mei Hongbao was able to save many dangerous shots, he was ultimately scored on by Jin Bo, and Jinan succumbed by a score of 1-2.</p>
<p>The Referee is Insulted Jinan has become an oppressed and weak nation. The forwards are isolated and helpless, merely wishing they had more strength than they did. The Western Merchants are on the rise and are aggressive. Once, Mei Hongbao hugged the ball with both hands and hesitated slightly. The Western Merchant's Haitley rushed up and collided with him, causing him to fall into the goal with the ball. Referee Lennox ruled the goal invalid and penalized the Western Merchants instead, causing resistance and insults from a Western spectator. Later, Jinan was penalized with a penalty kick, and the Western person again scolded the referee for nitpicking. Lennox was furious and ran to the stands to scold the Western person. The Chinese spectators applauded greatly. According to his subsequent explanation, the goal where Mei Hongbao fell into the goal was not counted because Jin Bo used his foot to poke rather than撞 (collision), so the Western Merchants were penalized.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick Stoke took the penalty kick with great force, but it was right at the center of the goal, allowing Mei Hongbao to kick it back out. It was very fortunate that this ball did not go in. Later, Jinan burned their boats and tried to counterattack. Luo Haiguang was changed from inside guard to center back, and then to center forward, intending to make a desperate gamble. However, the attack failed, and the defense was breached again. Haitley received a pass from Atai and attacked, which was very beautiful. As a result, Jinan lost 1-3.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Youyou Loses Again to Huacesi <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Ten to Two, Seven to One in the First Half</p>
<p>Huacesi's Forwards Are Incomparably Sharp</p>
<p>Youyou's Defensive Line Completely Collapses Youyou played against Huacesi in a Group A match at Shenyuan, and the fruit Youyou lost again to Huacesi by a score of two to ten. The British army was incredibly sharp, and Youyou's defense had difficulty coping. It was seven to one in the first half and three to one in the second half. In the first half, Huacesi scored five consecutive times before Youyou scored a goal by Sun Jinshun. Youyou scored first at the start of the second half, but then collapsed again. The match is briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>Losing Five Times in a Row After the rain, the field was muddy, making it difficult to run. Huacesi was slightly less effective, but their running speed remained undiminished. In terms of physical strength and running in all directions, Youyou was far behind. The center defensive line was vacant on the right because Chen Jiaqiu moved to the center to assist Huang Ruihua. The ball flowed in continuously. At the beginning, when Youyou kicked off, Huacesi attacked fiercely, but they were able to hold on for 20 minutes. Xue Baer went deep from the left, A Qiao passed, and Kang Po Dun shot, making it one to zero. In the next 15 minutes, the ball was like a continuous string of beads. Jones and A Qiao scored three to zero successively. Jones made a backhand shot, which was very beautiful, making it five to zero.</p>
<p>A Sign of Revival Youyou opened the scoring at this time. Sun Hupei rushed in from the left along the edge. Li Qiao Shi failed to stop him, and Ai Ge Deng also lost his footing. Sun Jinshun saw the opportunity and rushed to the spot at the same time as Tao Lewei. Sun Jinshun dribbled the ball around, and Tao Lewei was about to follow, but the ball had already been shot in by Sun, giving Youyou a sign of revival. Xi Qiaosheng shot fiercely, but it happened to fall into He Bate's arms. Sun Jinshun was preparing to attack again in front of the goal, but Qiaosheng overshot, and they had to retreat. Unexpectedly, Huacesi came again. In the last three minutes of the first half, Mao Lin and Xue Baer each scored again, making it seven to one.</p>
<p>Ultimately Failed At the start of the second half, Youyou still tried to counterattack and fought fiercely. Five minutes later, Huang Ruihua sent a ball to Zhong Yongsen, who rushed straight in. Tao Lewei tried to intercept him, but Zhong dodged him and sent it to the center, and Xi Qiaosheng scored with one kick, making it seven to two. Youyou's future was slightly less bleak. The two sides held each other for 20 minutes. Chen Jiaqiu dribbled the ball in, and Mao Lin knocked him down from behind. The referee penalized Youyou with a free kick, causing a great uproar among the audience. As a result of this free kick, A Qiao scored again. Finally, Kang Po Dun scored again</p>
<p>scoring twice in a row, and the final score was ten to two. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Huacesi</p>
<p>Wei Ersen Mao Lin   Tao Lewei   A Qiao   He Bate Smith   Kang Po Dun    Ai Ge Deng   Jones    Li Qiao Shi Xue Baer  Youyou</p>

<p>Five Selected Donghua Players Will Not Attend</p>
<p>=Hong Kong Team Adjusts Lineup, Arrives in Shanghai on the 9th=</p>
<p>=A Touchstone with Hua Lian, a 5-5 Draw=</p>
<p>The second trial match for the Shanghai inter-city football team is scheduled to be held at 3:00 p.m. this afternoon at the Shenyuan football field. The rosters for the white and mixed teams have been announced by the Western Union, but five of the Donghua team's selected players, except for Wan Jiahua who is in Tianjin, will also be unable to attend. The level of interest will inevitably be greatly reduced. How the lineup will be adjusted at the last minute is still unknown and may be as sloppy as the first time. The announced lineups are listed below:</p>
<p>White Team</p>
<p>Xu Yahui (Jinan) Wei Gensheng (Western Police) Tuina (Western Police) A Qiao (Huacesi) Zhou Xianshu (Donghua) Smith (Huacesi) Dai Linjing (Donghua) Tao Lewei (Huacesi) Chen Jiaqiu (Youyou) Remidi (French Merchants) Zhong Yongsen (Youyou)</p>

Fu Lusi replaces Zhou Xianshu, Maolin replaces Dai Linjing, Maida replaces Tu Kaiyuan, Fafanqiao replaces Wan Xianghua, and Bosailei replaces Li Yichen. Let's see how it is arranged at the last minute.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Adjusts Lineup</p>

<p>According to Hong Kong news, Hong Kong's inter-city team's goalkeeper Bao Jiaping and left inside forward E. Stollange are unable to leave Hong Kong due to matters and it has been decided to have Li Nate and Ai Li Aotu of the Kowloon Association replace them. Ai Li Aotu replaces Stollange, and Mai Ke Hatai of the Police Team takes Bao Jiaping's place. Li Nate serves as a reserve. This is the third time Hong Kong has changed its lineup.</p>

<p>Japan and Australia Meet in the Second Week (London, 2nd, Reuters) The draw for the Davis Cup was held here today, with ministers and representatives from fifteen countries in attendance. Sir Hall conducted the draw. Sir Hall said in his speech that when the draw was held in England last time, the number of players participating in the competition was only a quarter of this year's. This international alliance of tennis has no one who wants to withdraw, nor anyone who does not want to participate.

Feixia counterattacked fiercely in the second half, but because they lost too many points in the first half, it was difficult to recover. Zhanghua's victory over Datong and Pirates' victory over Fanhuang were like eggs hitting rocks, as they did not encounter worthy opponents. The scores of the three groups are listed below:</p>

<p>Among the three matches, the Agile Feet vs. Insurance game was particularly dynamic. The game started around 2:00 PM. After the field thawed and the sun evaporated the moisture, the ground was moist but not wet, and soft yet elastic, perfect for a football match. In the first half, Agile Feet launched a fierce attack, seemingly poised to conquer the city with one bold stroke. Unexpectedly, they ventured too deep, causing trouble within their own ranks, allowing Insurance to score a goal. In the second half, they launched several counterattacks, but to no avail, ultimately losing to Insurance by a score of 1 to 0.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Northerners and Southerners <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Le Ting Shi</p>
<p>This was what I thought of after reading the discussions on the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School"! The Northerners' contempt for Southerners has become a tradition. This is not merely due to differences in customs. I think the main reason is that historically, invaders mostly came from the north, first conquering the northern part of China, and then carrying the Northerners southward. Thus, in the eyes of Northerners, Southerners are also the conquered. When the Two Lu's entered Jin, the Northerners clearly showed disdain amidst their jubilation. Providing evidence would be too cumbersome, so let's not discuss it for now. It's easier to see that in Yang Jie Zhi's "Records of the Buddhist Temples of Luoyang," Southerners are often disparaged and not regarded as equals. As for the Yuan Dynasty, the people were clearly divided into four classes: first, the Mongols; second, the Semu people; third, the Han people, i.e., the Northerners; and fourth, the Southerners, because they were the last to surrender. Surrendering last, from their perspective, meant exhausting all resources and being forced to cease fighting due to the strength of the South. From the invaders' perspective, however, it meant being ignorant of the times and resisting the king's army for too long. Of course, descendants still surrendered, but their qualification for slavery was the lowest. Because it was low, their rank was the lowest, and everyone could despise them. By the Qing Dynasty, this account was rehashed, and its aftereffects still linger today. If history from now on no longer repeats itself, it would truly be a blessing not only for Southerners.</p>
<p>Of course, Southerners have their shortcomings. When the powerful and wealthy moved south, they brought with them a corrupt and decadent atmosphere, while the North remained relatively clean. Their temperaments are also different. They have shortcomings, but also strengths, just like Northerners possess both. In my opinion, the Northerners' strength is their groundedness, while the Southerners' strength is their agility. However, the downside of groundedness is dullness, and the downside of agility is cunning. Therefore, a certain gentleman once pointed out their shortcomings, saying: Northerners are "full all day and have nothing to occupy their minds"; Southerners are "together all day and never speak of righteousness." As far as the leisure class is concerned, I think this is largely true. Shortcomings can be corrected, and strengths can be learned from each other. There is a saying in physiognomy that a Northerner with Southern features, or a Southerner with Northern features, will be noble. I don't think this is nonsense. A Northerner with Southern features is both grounded and agile, while a Southerner with Northern features is, needless to say, agile and grounded. The so-called "noble" in the past simply meant success in those times. In the present, it means achieving beneficial undertakings. This is a small way for the Chinese to renew themselves. However, Southerners write more articles, and the North has been influenced. Aren't there more glib, evasive, and self-pitying writings in Beijing newspapers than six or seven years ago? If this were to marry with the Northerners' inherent "glibness," the offspring would certainly be an ominous new inferior breed!</p>

<p>— Yu Yang Ling</p>
<p>Refined people and the wealthy always like to keep some creatures at home for appreciation. Once they are kept by them, these creatures are generally changed. For example, plum blossoms must be "beautiful in their crookedness, uninteresting when straight; beautiful in their obliqueness, uninspiring when upright; beautiful in their sparseness, lacking charm when dense." Thus, they "chop the straight, thin the dense, and uproot the upright." This was criticized by Gong Ding'an, who believed that what they cultivated were all "sick plum blossoms." As for animals, there is a kind of goldfish, said to be a variation of the carp, also for appreciation.</p>
<p>I have never liked these ornamental creatures, especially looking down on those goldfish with bulging heads and protruding eyes. Every time I see it wriggling in a glass tank, I never believe that it is a living thing. Its wriggling lacks the vitality of splashing around, and does not resemble the movement of a living thing. However, it is this lifeless goldfish that has recently surprised me. A lady living in the same residence keeps such a goldfish, but only one, in a small washbasin. When she was about to return to her hometown, she gave us the goldfish and the washbasin, saying that if we were happy to, we only needed to change the water for it once a day. Although we received it, we found it very funny, thinking that such a thing would die in less than a day, so we casually put it on the windowsill and didn't bother with it at all.</p>
<p>The weather got colder day by day, so cold that all the water in the room froze. One day, I happened to walk to the windowsill and saw that the water in the washbasin was also a block of ice, so I thought to myself that the goldfish must be dead. Taking a closer look, it was lying on top of the ice block on the edge of the washbasin, still wriggling, not dead. This surprised me greatly, and at the same time, I felt a little sympathy, melted the ice for it, and changed the water. But the next day, the water still froze, the third day, the fourth day... it was like this for several days in a row, and the goldfish was finally unharmed, and is still wriggling without vitality to this day.</p>
<p>I am most prone to making a fuss over nothing. I have thought about this for a long time, and at the same time, I thought of Nietzsche's words in "The Will to Power": "Nature is cruel to the darlings of fate... but nature is tolerant, protective, and cherishing of lowly things... middle and even lower species. Therefore, the latter often have great reproductive power and survivability, while the former are destroyed very quickly and their numbers decrease." I think it is very true. At the same time, I also thought that the Chinese people, in extreme poverty and harsh environments, can still reproduce and survive, which can also be said to be divinely favored, almost like goldfish. They are both fit for survival in the struggle for existence. Will such a Chinese nation become a nation dedicated to appreciation like goldfish in the future? But that would still be considered good. I am only afraid that it will become a poisonous fungus. Fungi are extremely low-level organisms, and their reproductive power and survivability are also the greatest.</p>

<p>— Ren Bai Ge</p>
<p>Even chickens have a hen-house. Even dogs have a kennel. Even pigs have a sty. Yet, I have no home.</p>
<p>Home, my home lying in the embrace of green mountains, my home hiding behind green bamboos, I hear it is still there. The gentle valley breeze, the lazy sun, the crowing of chickens, the puffs of green smoke, I imagine are still there, and are blowing, shining, calling, and rising. Yet, I am not there. To turn it around, home has no me.</p>
<p>To say that I have no home, the home is still there; to say that I have a home, the home has no me. Sometimes, even I am a little confused, finding it difficult to answer all those who love me and therefore ask about my home. Yet, my grandmother's smile is gone, my uncle's candies are gone, my father's gentle concern is gone, my siblings' playfulness is gone, and I can only say this: I have no home.</p>
<p>Perhaps I was born a few decades too early? Perhaps I was born a few centuries too late? Watching my father's farmland decrease day by day, watching my father's face age day by day, watching my father's sighs increase day by day, watching my father's temperament become more irritable day by day, I could not bear to accompany him in that change for long. I could only leave him reluctantly for a while, and go far away. From then on, home had no me.</p>
<p>Years of wandering have made it easy for me to miss home all the time. I miss my grandmother, who is nearly a hundred years old. I miss my uncle, who is all alone. I miss my father, who has been widowed for half his life. I miss my younger siblings, who lost their infancy. Yet, I cannot help but go far away, even if I have a home, I cannot return.</p>
<p>There are many people in the world who have no home to return to. Yet, I envy their happiness of being homeless. At most, they have only tasted the sadness of loneliness. I have to taste the sadness beyond this loneliness! At the very least, I have to shed another tear for my longing for home. Because on the burden of emotion, I am still burdened with a home that I miss.</p>
<p>Now, here, I can imagine my father is living the life of a serf in the Middle Ages (although we were born in the country that claims to be the earliest civilized in the so-called civilized twentieth century). The grain tax of more than ten times a year requires his blood and sweat to pay. The conscription of more than ten times a month requires his blood and sweat to provide. All kinds of exorbitant taxes have already bent his old bones. Yet, he still has to use his few bent old bones to support the home I miss. Little does he know that the home I miss has long been destroyed, and I have long had no home.</p>
<p>Fleeting clouds of worldly affairs, ripples of life, can I be allowed to drift in the air for a long time, or draw a few more circles on the water? I cannot be without a home forever. But I hope everyone has one, and it is gentle and sweet.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Liang Ren Gong in Hunan <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shi Xia</p>
<p>"Four feet in the air, let's see what you can do!"</p>
<p>"Listening with one ear, in the end it's nothing!"</p>
<p>This is a humorous couplet used by the conservative faction in Hunan to mock Chen Baozhen and Xiong Xiling after the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform, taking apart the characters of Xiong and Chen, which is quite interesting. Originally, the Hundred Days' Reform movement in Hunan was jointly organized by officials and gentry, with Chen Zhongcheng representing the official side and Xiong Shuchang representing the gentry side. In this movement, Kang and Liang were the main figures. Kang Youwei was in Beijing, gaining the trust of Emperor Guangxu, so the situation in Beijing was very intense. Liang Qichao was in Hunan, gaining the trust of Chen Zhongcheng, so the situation in Hunan was also very intense. Why did Mr. Liang come to Hunan? According to Xiong Xiling's letter to Chen Zhongcheng, the invitation of Liang Zhuoru as an instructor originated from Huang Gongdu (Huang Zunxian, then the Hunan Salt Commissioner), and Zou Yuanfan and Ling and Boyan (Chen Sanli, Chen Zhongcheng's son) all agreed. Mr. Liang came to Hunan, presided over the Academy of Current Affairs, and became the chief instructor. Han Wenju and Ye Juemai, who came with him, became instructors, and the Kang faction's power was at its peak for a time. Moreover, all the teachers and students in the academy praised each other, saying either "the people who teach today are those who will assist the dynasty in its revival," or "those who will take on difficult tasks in the future are all sixteen-year-old children from the academy." This was really enough to make the conservative faction's eyes burn with fire. What's more, the diary of the Academy of Current Affairs, the comments on the course exercises, the lectures of the South Society, and the articles published in the Xiang Bao and the Xiang Xue Bao were all Kang faction's arguments that the conservative faction regarded as heresy!</p>
<p>Naturally, those arguments that were regarded as heresy, when viewed today more than thirty years later, are inevitably commonplace, shallow, and ridiculous. But in those days, they inevitably felt like earth-shattering events! For example, Mr. Liang commented on a diary, saying:</p>
<p>"Of the twenty-four dynasties, no one is worthy of Confucius' title of king. Occasionally, a few hegemons were born among them, and the rest were all traitors to the people."</p>
<p>Condemning all emperors as traitors to the people, and only acknowledging a few hegemons among them, this could not but shock the Confucian scholars. Another comment on a question-and-answer: "A minister is one who handles civil affairs with the ruler. It's like opening a shop. The ruler is the manager of the shop, and the minister is the shopkeeper, etc." Although Mr. Liang did not say that the people are the major shareholders of this shop, he already did not recognize the "righteousness of the ruler and minister" that Confucian scholars had always talked about. Another comment on a course exercise: "The Spring and Autumn Great Harmony learning all speaks of the rights of the people. Why not extract the rights of the people mentioned in the Six Classics and compile them into a book? It would also be a grand sight."</p>
<p>Mr. Liang advocated for the rights of the people and made many arguments. For example, he commented on a diary, saying:</p>
<p>"If public law wants to take a country, it must first have the great support of the people, and then that country can be taken by me. Therefore, those who can promote the rights of the people can never perish." He also said: "Although the parliament originated in the West, in fact, the meaning of it is mostly found in the biographies of the Five Classics and the philosophers. It is a pity that the rule of the monarch is too long, and no one dares to speak of it!" Mr. Liang wanted to advocate for parliamentary politics. He advocated for the rights of the people and parliament, but he could not help but resort to the Five Classics and Six Classics. Now we may laugh at his pedantry, but when we think of him in the environment at the time, we cannot help but forgive his painstaking efforts. He commented on a course exercise: "Today, if we want to seek reform, we must start with the emperor lowering his dignity. If we do not first change the etiquette of bowing and kneeling, and superiors and inferiors still practice empty formalities, we will be laughed at by foreign countries for everything we do." Mr. Liang boldly advocated for the emperor to lower his dignity and abolish the etiquette of bowing and kneeling. He also commented on a diary, saying: "China's bandits are very rampant. Superiors have no etiquette, and inferiors have no learning. The people rebel, and there will be no day of mourning. Today's reform must first change the laws and regulations. Although clothing is a trivial matter, it is closest to the human body. Therefore, there has never been a reform that did not first change clothing. If this can be changed, nothing cannot be changed." Mr. Liang advocated for changing the laws and regulations and changing clothing, which were all bold words, and all of them were going to be attacked by the conservative faction in Hunan. Strangely, the temperament of the people of Hunan is to go to extremes. From the Hundred Days' Reform to the present, in every political change, the people of Hunan are always at the forefront of the opposing extremes. In the Hundred Days' Reform, Tan Sitong, Xiong Xiling and others stood at the forefront of the reformist faction; Ye Dehui, Wang Yiwu and others stood at the forefront of the conservative faction. During the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution, Hunan was the first to respond, but Huang Zhonghao, the first general to die for the Manchu Qing, was also from Hunan. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, Yang Du, the leader of the Preparatory Council, was from Hunan, and Cai E, who was at the forefront of the campaign against Yuan, was also from Hunan.</p>
<p>Understanding the temperament of the people of Hunan, one understands the Hundred Days' Reform. Liang Rengong in Hunan had to be warmly welcomed by the reformist faction on the one hand, and frantically attacked by the conservative faction on the other.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuan Peng</p>
<p>As she walked through the back door, the female cook saw her and asked, "Are you the nanny?" She carefully replied, "Yes! What is your sister-in-law to this family?" "I am a maidservant. We will be eating in the same room in the future..." The female cook, who was around forty years old, saw the young nanny and treated her as if she were her own daughter. "Come and sit in the kitchen for a while, the madam hasn't gotten up yet!" The female cook led her to the kitchen. She was plunged into an unfamiliar environment, like a fish thrown onto mud. Her movements and eyes were dull, and she sat there like a blockhead. Soon, she heard a sobbing sound upstairs, as if someone were choking the throat. The female cook turned to the nanny and said, "This is the crying child... a rare child who cries so much... He's fine during the day, but he chooses to cry at night. He cried non-stop last night..." "Maybe it's because he doesn't have milk to eat." "The madam had a lot of milk when he was first born for two months." The female cook deliberately softened her tone and said with a nasal sound, "She got pregnant again in the third month..." "Why didn't you hire a nanny sooner?" she asked indifferently. "The previous nanny just left three days ago. She quit after only a week." "Why did she quit?" "..." The female cook answered with a long, mysterious smile. The new nanny stood in front of the madam. The madam's brain left a deep impression of her. A dark face, unclean clothes... The dirt behind her ears and on her neck did not escape the madam's sharp eyes</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was no movement in foreign call loans. The morning and afternoon markets still opened at 2%. The "hua tou" was not increased, remaining unchanged. The transaction volume for discount notes was about 2.45 million in the morning market and over 400,000 in the afternoon market. The transaction volume at the small clearinghouse was over 300,000. Bank settlements were lighter due to the afternoon closure of foreign banks on Saturdays.

<h3 id="e245">Securities and Bond Markets Show Slight Activity <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>｜But Lacking Counterparties for Large Amounts｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange showed slight activity, but the fluctuations were still very minor, and the transaction volume did not increase much. However, the floor seemed very tight. Occasionally, there were larger transactions in and out, but it was often impossible to find corresponding counterparties, which made speculators hesitant. The market opening in the morning was still chaotic. Although various groups were trading in and out, there was no enthusiasm, so the market price fluctuated by only one or two jiao. The second session of trading was still very quiet, with slight swap trading. The market price was slightly better by five fen or one jiao, and the sentiment was very sluggish. At the afternoon opening, there was slightly more demand for No. 5 bonds. Except for the demobilization bonds, which were still down 1.5 jiao, the rest slightly rose by one or two jiao to three jiao. The market showed slight activity, and at the close, there was more demand for No. 16 bonds, and the market price improved by another one or two jiao. The results all came back up one or two jiao to more than half a yuan. The trend was that those who sold short dared not continue to do so, and the bulls persisted, so it will probably not be easy to come back down in the future. The total transaction volume was 8,581,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot trading. The total for futures salt tax was 3,270,000, demobilization bonds accounted for 950,000, 19th Customs Bonds accounted for 595,000, 20-volume and 20th Customs Bonds totaled 1,490,000, and Gold Short-term Consolidation Bonds totaled 1,215,000. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to 300,000 to 400,000.</p>
<h3 id="e246">New York Stock Market Gradually Rises <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Sincere Foreign Firm Report: On the 2nd, the New York stock market was slightly flatter than before. Those who profited consolidated their positions, and trading was slightly lighter. Commercial news was quite good. The Federal Reserve Bank reduced the rediscount rate from 2% to 1.5%. Many viewed this as a measure to promote the government's issuance of public bonds and also as a way to prevent gold from flowing into the United States, causing the U.S. dollar to rise sharply. Bonds therefore rose by several jiao to about seven yuan. Goods showed mixed fluctuations. The full-day transaction volume was 2.87 million shares. (Wheat) Due to brokers selling slightly, the news was favorable for the bulls and could be bought. (Cotton) Fertilizer sales increased, and the acreage reduction report was quite favorable. The exchange rate was uncertain, causing those who wanted to buy to hesitate. The technical position had improved, and sentiment was good, so it was very easy to rise. The market seemed to be gradually advancing. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day:</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks: 108.31, down 0.64</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks: 51.04, up 0.10</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks: 28.15, up 0.04</p>
<p>40 Bonds: 90.66, up 0.45</p>
<p>11 Commodities: 53.59, up 0.05</p>
<h3 id="e247">Yarn and Cotton: Standard Yarn and Cotton in a Quiet but Firm Situation <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remained quiet, and the situation gradually stabilized. Some believed that due to the high price of raw cotton, factories were facing increasing difficulties. If sales did not pick up soon, there might be a possibility of reducing production in the coming spring. Therefore, most people were taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the yarn market.</p>
<p>Manbiao Rose by Three to Four Jiao:</p>
<p>At the opening of the Manbiao market, due to the slight increase in foreign cotton and the rise in gold prices, there were not many sellers in the market. Prices for various months rose by two, three, and four jiao. In the afternoon, the current month rose by two jiao, and the distant months fell by one jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 7,050 bales. It was found that Yuan Da sold 550 bales, Rui Da 400 bales, Yi Chang 500 bales, Xin Cheng 300 bales, and Da Chang 250 bales. Da Feng bought 1,450 bales, Jin Chang 950 bales, and Da Chang Cheng 350 bales. The closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Manbiao Closing Price: Change: Inventory:</p>
<p>April: 17.71 yuan, up 0.34 yuan, 1,700</p>
<p>February: 17.30 yuan, up 0.04 yuan, 2,750</p>
<p>Total: 9,600</p>
<p>March: 17.52 yuan, 3,150</p>
<p>Yarn Sales of 510 Bales: Current yarn sales were still good. It was found that various groups bought a total of 510 bales throughout the day. The market was flat. The purchase amounts for each group were as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 180</p>
<p>Shantou: 30</p>
<p>Luzhou: 10</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: 5</p>
<p>Inland: 225</p>
<p>Ningbo: 40</p>
<p>Changsha: 20</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Rose in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon, but Overseas Cotton Markets Remained Firm, and the Exchange Rate also Decreased, Causing the Calculation Price to Trend Higher. Therefore, Some People Were Bullish Based on the Strength of Foreign Cotton, but Yuan Da Was Selling on Rises and Continuing to Add Positions. Both Bulls and Bears Had Great Opposition. However, the Yarn Market Looked Very Desolate.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rose and then Fell Again:</p>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Biao market, it was firm following the sentiment of the previous day. Foreign cotton also rose. Prices for various months rose by one jiao to two and a half jiao. In the afternoon, prices fell by one jiao to one and a half jiao due to long positions being closed. The total transaction volume for the day was 56,700 dan. It was found that Yuan Da sold 3,400 dan, Chang Feng 5,800 dan, Shen Ji 1,500 dan, Xin Cheng 5,500 dan, Tong Ji 3,000 dan, Chun Ji 1,200 dan, and Geng Feng 1,300 dan.

<p>Manufacturers Stopped Purchasing: Demand for Raw Cotton and Spot Cotton Increasingly Quiet:</p>
<p>Each factory, because yarn had no outlet and also because of the past practice of stopping work for several days at the end of the year, temporarily stopped purchasing raw materials. The sources included Yao cotton 480 bales, Tong cotton 1,056 bales, Fire Engine Cotton 38.25 Yong An Factory bought 500 bales and sent them to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was sluggish, and dealers were watching. It was firm initially due to dealers buying, but then softened due to reactive selling. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 3 to 8 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 6 points, and futures rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 7 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to short covering and speculative buying, but then weakened due to selling by European exporters and long position closings. As a result, Ping Er fell by 1 rupee 7.5 jiao, Ormula fell by half a rupee, and White Locke remained unchanged. The original telegram recordings are on the left (February 2nd telegram).</p>

<p>Flour Trading Only Over 100,000 Bags:</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning market opened for flour, the market for various months showed an initial flat and then steady trend. Since the quotations for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada fell by about 1.5 jiao, the sentiment was weak when the prices opened. However, with the final settlement imminent, trading inside and outside the industry generally decreased, especially the factory sell-offs, which felt more lifeless. Therefore, there was a slight uptrend. When the afternoon market opened, the current month mostly hovered, and there was a lot of trading. The distant months were slightly boosted by the Shandong group's slight appetite, but trading was still quiet. The total trading volume for the day was only over 100,000. As a result, February and March were each better by 2.5 li, April was better by 5 li, May was better by 7.5 li, June was unchanged, and July was better by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Wheat Futures Trading Suspended Starting Today <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>｜Reopening Set for the 19th｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months was still stable. However, the total trading volume for the day was still quiet. Moreover, the exchange temporarily suspended auctions as of yesterday due to settlement and the Spring Festival, and will resume normal auctions on the 19th of this month. Therefore, the market trading became more stagnant. As a result, only February and March were slightly better by 2 fen compared to the previous day, and the rest had no comparison. The spot wheat market also showed quietness, and the price was also calm. Kai Yao Bay wheat was 4.10 yuan, and Yingzhou wheat was 4.04 yuan, totaling 600 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e253">River Rice Arrived in Abundance, Turning Weak <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only over 30 ships arrived from various groups (over 5,000 shi). Initially, the market acted as the visitors saw the scarcity of goods, and everyone competed to handle them, and the situation seemed brisk. Unexpectedly, around noon, ships from the Minhang area arrived one after another, with 50 or 60 ships, which made the sentiment immediately discouraged, and the market color suddenly turned weak. Throughout the day, various groups, especially the Nanyang group, took in nearly 2,000 bags of late rice, and the market price continued to be better by 3 fen. Thick japonica and Du Yang tip were also better by 3 to 5 fen. Yin Yuan turned stable, and Bian Yuan seemed to be softening.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, various goods arrived from He Xia, with 45 to 46 ships. The various appetites on the market were very sluggish. Packaged rice was unchanged. The market price for high-quality white japonica rice was stable. Medium and lower prices were slightly closer to a jiao. The situation for early thin rice, Du Xian, Yin Yuan, Ke Xian, and Ping Ding was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Quanzhou Group Continued to Handle Ke Xian Rice <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Completely Stopped Handling... The Market Turned to Stability:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Ke Xian rice saw the Fuzhou group completely stop handling shipments, and the rising trend in the market had slowed down. Furthermore, the arrivals were continuous, and the goods en route had not all arrived. This was because after the Min group had smoothly handled shipments, it immediately led to the transportation by merchants. After Fuzhou stopped handling shipments and with the arrival of more goods, the market could have fallen back, but the Quanzhou group followed up with handling shipments, and their appetite was also great. Furthermore, the cost of incoming goods had already risen, and the owners were unwilling to let go easily, so the market remained firm. Yesterday, 850 bags of Hunan machine-processed red rice were handled by Quanzhou, priced at 6.90 yuan to 6.84 yuan. 200 bags of Jiao Hu Xian were priced at 6.87 yuan, and 100 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice were priced at 7.60 yuan. The native merchants also handled 110 bags of machine-processed rice bran as a courtesy, priced at 7.50 yuan. The quality of the rice varied slightly, so the market price also differed from the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market turned soft, in fact, because the owners were handling procedures to end the year, and all were easing up on flat sales. However, there were more than a dozen carts going out, and the price did not fluctuate much. High-quality soybeans were relatively lacking compared to medium-quality goods, and the selling price was slightly tighter by one or two fen. Lower-quality goods, on the other hand, fell by one or two fen. Yesterday's total market trading was estimated to be 8 or 9 carts of various soybeans from the factories, and the native street, inland, and exports had a total sales volume of 4 or 5 carts.</p>

<p>｜Jian Gong Rock Sugar Rises by Three Jiao｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise due to the continued rise in customs gold and the frequent shrinking of the Dutch exchange rate. The association's preliminary listing for 24 coarse sugar white ordinary was 20.10 yuan, and later it was traded at 20 yuan, which was another rise of 0.20 yuan compared to the previous day. High-quality Dutch red sugar was listed at 16.30 yuan, also a rise of 0.20 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B mark was listed at 20.50 yuan, a rise of 0.30 yuan, but it was not traded. Zhenyu No. 1 cotton white was listed at a rise of 0.30 yuan, at 19.20 yuan. Several dozen bags of domestic cotton red were opened, priced at 14.60 yuan. Jianbang number families Da Laihua opened 50 bags of Gong rock sugar, because the planting of the factory was short, the result was a rise of 0.30 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the wool and woolen cloth market was quite sluggish. The native street customers had no official transactions, and the atmosphere at the association listing was very quiet. The cargo price had no standard, because it was the end of the old lunar year. Those who had occasional negotiations were all those with urgent financial needs who were cutting out the pain and selling, and those with sufficient economic stores were bargaining to absorb them. Next were the Sichuan groups buying cheap Japanese goods. Otherwise, it can be said that there was no official position.</p>

<p>The 35-pound thin tinplate, which has been in short supply for many days, will have about 500 boxes available in mid-February, according to news from foreign firms. The price is currently being sold off at 60 yuan per box, and it is heard that can factories, etc., have already purchased over 100 boxes.</p>
<h3 id="e259">90-Pound American Tinplate Spot Goods Out of Stock <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The recent spot goods for 90-pound American tinplate have been very short in the market, and the incoming goods are unusually few. Therefore, the whole city is showing a panic of stockouts. The standard price is therefore unusually firm, estimated to open up to 15.8 yuan per box, up 0.2 yuan compared to before. Furthermore, British and German goods are also reported to be in short supply, so the market situation is even more upright. Yesterday, tobacco factories and printing factories, etc., purchased a forward cargo (April futures), with a price of 15.6 yuan per box. In addition, 90-pound double-linked and 100-pound single-linked double-linked goods, etc., are all in a normal state. The current market for 90-pound double-linked iron opens at 31.5 yuan per box, 100-pound single-linked at 17 yuan, and double-linked is estimated at 34.5 yuan. It is heard that there is not much opening due to the approaching end of the year.</p>

<p>(An increase of over 61,000 bales)</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese silk exports have plummeted due to the encroachment of Japanese silk and rayon. It was not until last year that it began to improve slightly. In the 22nd year, a total of 209,101 dan of yellow, white, and gray silks were exported, while in the previous year (the 21st year), it was only 147,624 dan, an increase of 61,477 dan.</p>
<p>(American Silk Weaving Factory Resumes Work)</p>
<p>American silk weaving factories have been reducing labor and stopping machines due to the global economic recession last year, the sluggish sales of silk fabrics, and the thick inventory. With the start of spring sales this year, the market has gradually turned around, so the silk weaving factories are now preparing to gradually resume work, and the consumption of raw silk is gradually increasing. (New York Silk Telegrams Continue to Transfer to Shanghai) The spring sales orders for overseas silk weaving factories have arrived, and the sales and consumption of raw silk are gradually increasing, and the appetite is gradually rising. The yellow, white, and factory silks initially sent to New York and other places by various European banks in Shanghai have continued to transfer to Shanghai since yesterday morning via telegrams. Unfortunately, the incoming price of B-grade white factory silk is only 567 yuan, and it is still difficult for the factories to sell, and negotiations are still difficult to reach an agreement. Yesterday, only Xinfu and other firms entered 60 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and the price trend was firm and stable.</p>

<h3 id="e281">Thought and Power <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Gongpu</p>
<p>Thought and power have a mutual relationship, and the rise and fall of power must be directly proportional to the expression of thought. This situation can be seen in the actions of an individual, and it can be seen even more clearly in the actions of a group of people. In ancient and modern history, the clearest examples of a group demonstrating great power through the convergence of thought fall into two major categories: (1) religion; and (2) the nation. Although there are often causal relationships between these, there is no doubt that the formation of much power in the past originated from the two major ideas of religion and the nation. As for the many sociologists today who analyze the factors that form these two ideas, there are many similarities, and the historical manifestations of religious and national power were often exploited by a minority and followed blindly by the masses, etc., all of which are beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Where there is thought, there is power, so thought is the source of power. Because of geographical, printing, and other obstacles, the spread of ideas in ancient times was not as convenient as it is today, so the establishment of a new idea and the destruction of an old power were not easy tasks. But today's situation is different. When we compare the recent situation of Soviet Russia with the generally backward state of culture of the Russian people in the past, it is truly astonishing (see Stalin's report at the Soviet Russian Communist Party Congress). Secondly, the success of the Italian Blackshirts and the recent victory of Hitler's dictatorship in Germany are both colorful expressions in modern history! It is an example of how the masses of people in several countries with different languages and histories can quickly form a great force from the spread of an idea.</p>
<p>Any idea that meets the needs of the majority of the masses can always gain the belief and power of the masses, and the prerequisite for gaining this belief and power lies in the ability to find the right people to lead this ideological movement and to use it effectively. Although the political ideas of the political transformations in Soviet Russia, Italy, and Germany are completely different, it must be said that their current success is due to proper leadership and effective use. The weak expression of popular power in China in recent years can be said to have reached its extreme. Taking the boycott of Japanese goods as an example, from an abstract point of view, it is of course something that the general public agrees with, but in practice, it is contrary to theory. Why? Because although boycotting Japanese goods is an idea that can be called upon, it is not effective due to the lack of leadership and application. Therefore, even an idea that can easily form power is just a name and cannot be achieved! We see that all problems in China today are not on track, and cannot produce a nationally unified force. In addition to the problem of the ideas themselves, the lack of people who lead ideas and methods of using ideas is indeed an important issue that deserves our attention.</p>
<h3 id="e282">The Goblins in Our Nation's Life <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>If you pass by the gate of a certain postal administration office, you are sure to see a group of people gathered there looking like beggars, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, wearing tattered clothes, resembling a group of goblins released from the gates of hell. However, although you often see this group of goblins, you may never have paid attention to their lives. Don't underestimate this group of goblins; they are the most hardworking, enduring, healthy, and outstanding citizens of our nation, but their lives are forever below the poverty line. I have even seen several who froze to death in the snow on the steps and were taken away by charitable organizations for burial.</p>
<p>The reality is this: when the post office is busy, for example, when ocean liners arrive in or depart from Shanghai, there is a large amount of mail that needs to be transported. At this time, a batch of temporary laborers are hired outside the gate to carry the mail. In recent years, with frequent transportation and an increasing volume of mail, the demand for temporary laborers has been especially high, with about a hundred people needed every day. The working hours are not fixed, ranging from as short as one or two hours to as long as a full day, depending on the degree of business. Their compensation is calculated by the hour and paid in cash, at the rate of ten cents per hour. The post office, because of the low cost, is happy to entrust all the heavy labor to them. This is much cheaper than hiring a permanent workforce, and they can be summoned at will and dismissed at will. If there is work, they are paid to hire; if there is no work, they can be ignored, and there is no danger of strikes. Perhaps this is very much in line with the principles of scientific management!</p>
<p>China's industry is not thriving, and the countryside is frequently bankrupt. The number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. As a result, there are too many people waiting for work in front of the post office. Therefore, the temporary workers needed by the post office are also experiencing a phenomenon of oversupply, with more monks than gruel. If the post office needs to hire ten temporary laborers at a certain time, a postal worker stands in a high place, takes ten pieces of paper, and throws them to the ground, while the group of goblin-like coolies below compete with each other. Whoever is stronger and grabs a piece of paper can work for a few hours. The old and weak, of course, do not get a chance and can only hang their heads in frustration, watching others work. But the young and strong who grab a piece of paper are not necessarily able to make ends meet. If they manage to grab five hours of work each day, they can have food and a bunkhouse to live in, maintaining the bare minimum of daily life. But if they fail to grab any work one day, or only work for one or two hours, they can only go hungry and cold, sleeping in the corners of the alleys. Especially on Sundays and holidays, the post office is closed as usual, with no work available, but the stomach refuses to rest. Without food, one will starve. Therefore, during the Lunar New Year, the post office closed for four consecutive days, leaving them without work for four days, which simply put them to death. However, during this festive New Year, when young masters and their girlfriends are leisurely enjoying themselves, who will think of this group of goblins enduring hunger in the wind and snow? Yet, they are the most hardworking, enduring, and outstanding citizens of our nation!</p>
<h3 id="e283">A Discussion on Professions: The Standard of a Proper Profession <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>"(So-and-so) does not engage in a proper profession" is a common phrase used to criticize those who do not have so-called proper professions. But what can be considered a proper profession? In the minds of people today, there is no fixed standard. For example, the profession of being an official is not only regarded as a proper profession by people in society, but also as the most glorious and noble profession. However, upon careful examination, the mentality of many officials is simply to make money and improve their own lives and status. This not only cannot be considered a proper profession, but it cannot even be called a profession at all. As for general corrupt officials who specialize in plundering and exploiting others, it would be a great injustice to call this a proper profession!</p>
<p>If the explanation of a proper profession is said to be based on the individual, as long as he uses his physical and mental labor to earn compensation, it can be said that he is not living off the blood and sweat of others and therefore has a proper profession, then even the wandering performers in the lower classes are contributing their performance skills. The bodies of martial arts performers are bruised all over, yet they only earn a few coins. Isn't this using their physical and mental labor to earn compensation? Not only those wandering performers, but even prostitutes endure humiliation and sacrifice their bodies to earn a few coins to live on. Isn't this also a proper profession of using physical and mental labor to earn compensation? Yet, people say that the professions of wandering performers and prostitutes are not proper professions.</p>
<p>In this case, the evaluation of what constitutes a proper profession must have a standard. Otherwise, we cannot ask everyone to engage in proper professions. However, the standards for proper professions set in today's society are inappropriate because everyone is centered on the individual, believing that as long as a person can obtain personal satisfaction through the price of his labor, he has a proper profession. In fact, when we evaluate whether a certain profession is proper, we must consider whether it is beneficial to human beings and social progress, and whether it can become part of the division of labor in social production. We can call a profession that meets these two prerequisites a proper profession; otherwise, it cannot be considered a proper profession.</p>
<p>Because of this, we can easily distinguish which professions are proper and which are not; and even within the same profession, we can distinguish which are proper and which are not. For example, with regard to the profession of being an official, if we follow the above standards, not only is being a corrupt official not a proper profession, but also participating in any organization that hinders social progress and undertaking work that hinders social progress cannot be considered a proper profession. On the other hand, working hard in a social organization that can promote social progress and fulfilling its function of promoting social progress and social production development can be considered a proper profession. Workers engaged in production, doctors, professors, writers, and artists, as long as they stand on the side of progress and can promote society and its productive endeavors, can all be called those who undertake one of the proper divisions of labor. In this sense, the professions of wandering performers and prostitutes are, of course, improper. We hope that society can provide everyone with a proper profession, and we also hope that no one in society will be forced to engage in an improper profession.</p>
<h3 id="e284">A Small Monograph: The Reasons for Discrimination Against People of Color <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In southern Africa, in colonies ruled by self-proclaimed civilized imperialist nations, we can see many bizarre phenomena. Those white people who consider themselves to be a superior race spare no effort to slander and insult people of color: for example, when traveling, black people can only ride in segregated vehicles; they cannot enter schools or theaters; they do not even have the right to ride streetcars or walk on sidewalks because, in the eyes of white people, black people are simply not qualified to be called human beings.</p>
<p>In German criminal law, there is even a clause that states: (If a German citizen has physical relations with a person of color, the state considers this act to be treason against the race, and the parties involved in the marriage shall be punished.) In civil law, such marriages are invalid. In the eyes of German legislators, such marriages with people of color hinder the development of the superior race and violate the glory of the German nation because the whole reason is: in the eyes of the German people, these people of color are simply not qualified to be called human beings.</p>
<p>Why do white people have this kind of discrimination against people of color? There are several different answers to this question:</p>
<p>(1) This school of thought believes that the source of discrimination against people of color lies in the expression of the need for self-preservation of individuals and groups. Therefore, they oppose immigration by people of color and cooperation with people of color.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>(2) This school of thought believes that these behaviors all contain sexual connotations. They explained that white women like people of color, so white men feel a kind of jealousy, which is the origin of discrimination.</p>
<p>(3) This school of thought, on the one hand, expresses regret for the mutual hostility between races, but on the other hand, believes that superior races have the obligation to cultivate inferior races.</p>
<p>The first school of thought explains the interests of discriminating against people of color from the position of the imperialist children of the motherland. They explain that to consolidate and maintain the interests of capitalists and some white workers in their own country, it is necessary to cruelly exploit people of color. Based on this policy, they do their best to propagate rumors about the violence and incompetence of people of color. In Africa, the wages of black people are fifteen shillings a week, while those of white workers are eight pounds a week. However, since the outbreak of the world economic panic in 1929, both white and black people have been severely affected. The fate of black people is, of course, tragic, and there are many white unemployed people. They looked for work everywhere, but because of the low cost of black labor, there was terrible competition. White people were indeed under considerable threat, so they expanded the gap of discrimination between races. The British Labour Party is the party that represents the interests of these white workers. It implemented a resolution to prohibit black people from becoming standard workers. However, many white workers felt that they had the same tragic fate as black workers. The second school of thought attempts to explain this social phenomenon in terms of sexual relations, but this attempt is clearly a failure. Sex is, for example, a link in the chain, but not the main link. The main link is an economic relationship, and this economic foundation is what explains the importance of the superstructure. Let us now assume that the phenomenon of white women liking people of color exists, but at least we should not explain it in terms of sexual relations. We should explain it in terms of very complicated reasons, the main one of course being economic reasons. This reason is self-evident, because the number of white women marrying people of color is, after all, not large, and it is clearly impossible to cause the jealousy and resentment of white people.</p>
<p>The third school of thought believes that white people should raise the culture of people of color and that the level of culture is proportional to the amount of needs. Therefore, in order to increase their needs, they work hard to promote commodities. This argument is very contradictory because, as a result of commodity dumping, people of color inevitably go bankrupt. After bankruptcy, their low-cost labor poses a great threat to white people, which in turn causes hostility. Therefore, this argument cannot justify itself either.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above, we can know that the origin of this discrimination against people of color is nothing more than what is determined by the mode of production.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Promoting National Goods and Revitalizing the Countryside <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Wu</p>
<p>Everyone knows that China is a country based on agriculture. Farmers make up the largest majority of the national population, and the countryside is the largest place of consumption and production. If our agricultural production is very developed, and the products consumed in the countryside are all our own national goods, then our entire industry will inevitably develop, and the country's status will never be like it is today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, our countryside is the vast raw material cultivation base of imperialism and the major market for dumping its goods. Under the control of the magic power of imperialism, our rural economy can neither preserve its old form nor embark on a new path, and it is inevitably falling into a crisis of bankruptcy. In recent years, as a result of various natural and man-made disasters, our rural economy has been completely bankrupt. The decline in agricultural productivity and the reduction in rural purchasing power are the real phenomena of the current Chinese countryside.</p>
<p>The decline in agricultural productivity has allowed imperialist agricultural products to be dumped into China in large quantities, in order to absorb our cash. The reduction in rural purchasing power has caused the industrial products of the cities to lose a vast market and cannot develop. This is one of the main reasons for the decline of Chinese industry and everything falling into poverty. People promote national goods, but they only see the cities and not the countryside. They only know that the sales of imperialist goods in the cities hinder the development of national goods, but they do not know that their foreign cloth, foreign oil, foreign rice, etc., also hinder the development of national goods when they are dumped into the countryside. Therefore, from last year's (National Goods Year) to this year's (Women's National Goods Year), whether it was (men) or (women), neither did a good job. As a result, all the silk factories in Shanghai went bankrupt together, a large number of silk weaving factories closed down, and foreign rice imports amounted to 16 to 17 million dan, with an excess of 80 to 90 million yuan!</p>
<p>I believe that if we don't talk about promoting national goods, then so be it. If we want to talk about promoting national goods, we must revitalize the rural economy. The meaning of promoting national goods should be and must be: to revitalize industry and agriculture and to prosper both cities and the countryside. If we leave the countryside alone and only stay in the cities to promote national goods, scolding fashionable women every day, there will be no future!</p>
<p>At the same time, and more importantly, we should actively rise up to remove the economic and political shackles of imperialism on us. If we do not do this and only avoid the substance and promote national goods, shouting what (changing people's hearts), there will be no future either. Because imperialism can not only use our tariff autonomy to dump its goods, but also open factories, mines, operate shipping, and establish concessions in our interior. Our entire economic life is held in the palms of imperialism. If we do not work hard to use active methods to desperately break out of its palms, and fantasize about growing and developing peacefully in its palms, aren't we dreaming?</p>
<p>Special Solicitation</p>
<h3 id="e286">The Mystery of Rationalizing Commissions <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Ci An</p>
<p>Last Sunday, we asked this publication to convey a message to unemployed friends to solicit a few advertising colleagues. The next day, we received more than a dozen applications, and letters continued to arrive on the third and fourth days.</p>
<p>At first, we only wanted to find a few friends to help, but Mr. Editor added a title of (Rationalizing Commissions) to the free advertisement in the last issue, which made many people want to understand. Even current employees of two advertising companies came to inquire. Of course, they were not here to apply, but to ask about the method.</p>
<p>Now, let's use this publication's filler space to provide an answer.</p>
<p>Most of the personnel who serve in the advertising departments of major newspapers are paid monthly salaries, just like the employees of other departments. In large-scale advertising companies, advertising staff also receive salaries, in addition to commissions. Next, there are only commissions and transportation expenses, without salaries. We can't even afford transportation expenses now, so we can only rely on commissions. Usually, commissions are handled uniformly, that is, 30% is 30%, and 20% is only 20%. Whether you work hard or not, it doesn't matter; in any case, a few percent is a few percent. There is no reward for pulling in more advertising.</p>
<p>We now stipulate that the percentage of commissions should increase with the amount of advertising, so that those who work hard will receive extra compensation. To put it simply: (1) When the total amount of advertising revenue handled by each person per month is less than 500 yuan, the commission is only 20%; (2) When it exceeds 500 yuan but is less than 1,000 yuan, the commission is calculated at 25%; (3) When it exceeds 1,000 yuan but is less than 2,000 yuan, the commission is 30%; (4) All amounts above 2,000 yuan are calculated at 35%. In addition, all advertising staff must sign a three-month trial contract upon entry. After three months, if both parties are satisfied, the period will be extended.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, most of the letters we have received are from students who have just left or are about to leave school. However, we are deeply afraid that the students will not be used to this kind of advertising life because going out to find business requires asking for help from people at every step, relying on people, fawning on people, and may even be ridiculed by others in the end. However, we are still extremely welcome to the students, as long as individuals have the courage, perseverance, and the ability to deal with wealthy people or arrogant big shots, they will certainly be able to do the job happily. Otherwise, although the newspaper can take care of food and lodging, we also think it is a pity to waste the time of young people.</p>
<p>If there are still friends who want to try, feel free to write to us as before to discuss it because we do need advertising staff.</p>
<p>Please send letters directly to the Advertising Department of the Citizen Newspaper, Taipingfang, Hankou Road, and do not ask Mr. Di to forward them, to avoid additional procedures.</p>

<p>— Pu Lin</p>
<p>Nanjing Road! The heart of this great Shanghai!</p>
<p>Here, the rocky cliffs of buildings form a deep riverbed, where streams of people, vehicles, and money are intertwined. From east to west, from south to north, the giant streams flow continuously. They constantly impact the great city, the great civilization, and the great era.</p>
<p>Atop the seven-story buildings, steel-boned spires soar, reflecting red and green lights like electric torches, and the radio plays the symphony of the metropolis—Xuangong's love history, commercial reports, Mei Lanfang, political news, Wang Wuneng, Ding Guaiguai.</p>
<p>Banners for big sales flutter everywhere—big sales, bargain sales, dumping, big XXX. From the ground to the roof, from the roof to the sky, the banners of big sales stretch out their giant hands, seizing everyone's heart and the first person's money.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road! Here, people are flying, vehicles are flying, money is flying, and time is flying too.</p>
<p>In that great department store, the bridge of cigarettes faces the mountain of thermos bottles, and the harbor of coats is surrounded by the sea of silks; Miss’s head is buried in a pile of socks, choosing silk stockings with floral heels; young wives are in the aisle of cosmetics, picking out the lipstick they need; children are throwing tantrums at their grandmothers, insisting on buying the lopsided Chaplin; newlyweds lean on their husbands' shoulders, considering children's clothing; in the corner, two art school students are arguing over the patterns on the carpet; ...hubbub, quarrels, bells, laughter, shoe sounds, coughs.</p>
<p>Elevators are constantly devouring and spewing, extending all the way to the night garden on the roof. The stage of life, the theater of joys and sorrows, the dance of the times.</p>
<p>A transaction began in the corner: (Hey! Young master! Going home to play?)</p>
<p>(Where is your home?) (········) (········) Three rickshaws sped past the New World five minutes later.</p>
<p>In the Hongmiao Temple, devout men and women are bowing and kowtowing, and the incense is like the chimneys of the industrial district, drifting and pervading. As soon as the elder sister enters this temple surrounded by cement and steel, she prays very piously, asking the Bodhisattva to give her a dream of revelation so that she can win this round of lotteries.</p>
<p>Outside the temple: (Want one! Fountain pen!...) Then, the tram stopped in the center of Zhejiang Road intersection, and several voices immediately surrounded the tram: (Hey! Da Mei Evening News, Da Wan Night News...) (Hey! 130,000 yuan fraud case! Hey!) Thirteen-year-old girl giving birth, hey...)</p>
