<p>廢除苛捐雜稅。久爲國民一致之呼聲。本届財政會議。卽以此爲四大議題之一。嗣經議决。自民國二十三年七月起。至十二月底止。由各地方斟酌情形。分别先後。逐一廢除。以蘇民困。按歷年苛雜之擾民。多由征收方法之腐敗。而公家收入。則實際無多。果能整理良稅。平均負担。剔除中飽。調節支出。則苛雜之廢。初不甚難而本届會議仍以爲各省市籌辦地方自治期間。應行舉辦之事業甚多。平日之依賴雜項捐稅以資挹注者。不勝枚舉。設不妥爲籌劃。但令裁免各稅。或恐因噎廢食。乃又愼重議定。自下年度起。將中央收入之印花稅一項。儘先爲補助地方之準備。並將烟酒牌照一稅全部劃歸地方征收。其支出中之司法經費一項。原由地方支出者。一俟財政部與司法行政部議有辦法。亦由中央負担。似此苦心孤詣。委曲周至。無非在顧念法方。共謀［内外相維］之道而已。</p>
<p>今據財部整理地方捐稅委員會迭次報告。中央抵補地方之烟酒牌照稅。已於七月一日撥歸地方。以地方行政權作有力之推動。稅收均有增加。印花稅一項。自十一月起亦由郵局代售。但求稽徵得宜。稅收定亦可觀。一切苛雜。旣有此充裕之抵補。自更不應長此存在。萬一各地方依然遷延觀望。或藉故推託。則不僅違抗中央之法令。亦有負我民之期望。吾人以切身利害攸關。安可不亟予糾正。而任令繼續之宰割耶。</p>
<p>差幸本届財政會議亦經顧慮及此。而有設立各省市捐稅監理委員會之决議矣。聞其辦法。除已設參事會之各省市外。由財政部就該省市素孚聲望之公正人士中。遴選五人至七人。呈請行政院聘任爲委員而組織之。委員會之職權凡五。㈠調查境内之苛捐雜稅及徵收情形。㈡研究境内之捐稅整理辦法。㈢向本省市政府及財政廳局陳述本境之捐稅情形及整理辦法。㈣向監察院舉發境内之違法捐稅及稅務機關人員之違法行爲。箇中用意。無非在予人民以參加整理地方財政之機會。并尊重人民監督地方財政之權利而已。</p>
<p>今去年底廢絶苛雜之限期。不滿匝月。各地方能仰體中央意旨俯恤民間疾苦而實行廢除者。固已屢見於報章之記載。而陽奉陰違者。仍或不免。我國幅圓廣大。交通阻梗地方情形。隔膜異常。往往民隱不獲上達。民意莫由自申。一般之貪官汚吏乃得蒙敵中央。營私舞弊。財政部有鑒於此。業已呈准行政院。决照前議所定。組織各省市捐稅監理委員會。委員人選。亦經博訪周諮。初步確定凡身經政府遴選。充任委員之職者。當凛然於使命之重大。幸勿放棄責任。藉詞推諉。或刦於强暴。知而勿言。至於各地方當局。更應激發天良。相與合作。整理地方財政。解除民間痛苦。此時矣。此其時矣。</p>

<p>我國財政自昭和四年以來、漸次增加赤字公債、而旣經决定之十年度預算、竟達二十一億九千萬元、其赤字公債亦至七億五千萬元、内中軍部預算則突破十億元、甚至將内務農林之預算縮少、十年度預算於内務農林兩省之部分、較諸昭和八年度則極形减少、其結果使地方財政長此窮迫、目無農村產業、則當無眞正之國防、財政與國防應如何布置、所謂國策應如何訂立、尚希首相給予明白答覆、</p>

<p>美日極端對立</p>
<p>英國從中調和</p>
<p>已經停頓了三個月的海軍軍縮預備會議、十月二十三日午前十時半、又在唐寗街英國總理官邸重新開會、第一次會談的是英國代表麥克唐納爾·外長西門·海長蒙塞爾·及其他數人、和日本代表松平恒雄·海軍代表山本五十一·及其他二人、互相交換意見、其談話内容、雙方都嚴守秘密、不對外宣佈、在會塲秩序上、據說祇是日本代表說明日本對軍縮意見的要點、英方則設爲種種質問、其會談時間不及兩小時、次日午前十時、美國代表台維斯和海軍提督斯丹勒、與日本代表會於格拉利吉斯飯店、日代表也是說明其對軍縮的立塲、美國方面的答詞、除提高和平精神之外、對軍備平等的說話、表示以下意見、</p>
<p>［凡是一切國家的安全保障、要容許她有平等權利、是當然的事、這是美國所承認的、不過、各國不必要有平等的軍備、特别是以某一國家爲對手、而言安全保障的、就不必是其他國家的安全保障、這是應該加以考慮的、所以某一國家的軍備、以爲受其他隣近國的威脅、竟至於要求容許與其國的軍備平等、是不可能的、</p>
<p>在日本方面的意思、是以爲［無論如何、除廢除過去的比率主義實現軍備平等以外、别無他途、以上這一點、簡單的說、還不足以顯示倫敦預備會商的全面目、也還不足以判斷將來的結果、但是一般的趨勢、却可以大體看出來、美日之間的不能調和、而且今後將愈趨於僵局、是不可隱諱的、美國對遠東方面的觀察如下、</p>
<p>㈠日本有很活潑的商船隊、其運用非常靈敏、這是從側面帮助日本軍備的、　　㈡美國旣允許菲利濱獨立之後、卽是在遠東不建設軍事要塞上、更加一重保障、日本對此該十分安心、不必再有國防不安的說法、</p>
<p>㈢日本旣獲得了］滿洲］資源、於其戰時能力、增加了很多、所謂安全也該同其增加、</p>
<p>㈣日本并沒有像美國這様界乎兩大洋之間、需要較强大的海軍來保衛海上自由通航、</p>
<p>然而日本所懷念的是空車發達、尤其是重爆擊機有長足的進步、在一九二二年時、飛機續航力最大不過三百哩、現在則伸展到二千哩以上、戰鬭艦的行動半徑、那時候不過二千五百哩、最近因重油引擎的發達、及其他各種的改良、戰鬭艦的活動力可以遠至三千哩以外、一九三六年以後、許多新艦造成以後、三千五百哩　行動半徑、是會具體實現的、然則她地理上的價值、自然低落了不少、所以日本輕易不放鬆她的［軍備平等］主張、美國又以爲華盛頓倫敦兩條約是太平洋、甚至是世界和平的基礎、假如將這種基礎棄而不用、則新約勢必更難成立、前途的困難就更多了、</p>
<p>英國也有她的固定主張、就是世界的優勢海軍、她不需要大艦大砲、祗要多收有力的巡洋艦、這是日本所默認、是美國所難容忍的、但是英國對於外交、素來老練、旣有美日兩國的不能調和、也就不須馬上提出異議、以免三角對立、致全局破裂、不可收拾、因此英國要以調人自任、使美國的維持原有比率、再行總括的縮减軍備百分之二十的提示、與日本的［軍備平等］主張、兩相接近、不過我們看、過去日内瓦軍縮會議的史實、當事諸國都不肯放棄自己的利益、卽如英國擴大巡巡艦的主張、豈肯輕易讓步、現在進行的預備會談、形勢固不如正式會議之嚴重、但確實可以測騐將來變化如何、是一個很準確的風雨表、所以從現狀觀察、倒也未可樂觀哩、（十月二十五日於倫敦）</p>

<p>天禍中國，災患連年，旣先之以民二十之水災，繼復遭空前之國難，全國人民方不遑於人憂外患之掙扎，忽又旱魃乍臨，莫可擋禦，坐使赤地千里，田十龜裂，奄奄一息之農村經濟，至是不得不宣告最後階段的崩潰。據振務委員會前次報告，本年旱災省份達十一省、單位達二百六十三縣，以田畝之面積論，素有膏腴之江蘇省，亦達三千五百七十五萬畝之廣，其他省份及未曾調查以及水災蟲災之區域無論矣。夫以吾國經濟基礎之貧瘠，社會組織之脆弱，黄台之瓜，不堪再摘，乃竟大禍屢襲，擯之絶境，斯豈天之亡我，抑亦痛心也夫！　　此次受災區域，旣如是廣，而受災程度又如是深，一幅災黎之顚沛流離，鬻妻賣兒慘狀，自非吾人所堪設想，更非都市一殷飽安樂養尊處優者所能臆測，轉瞬隆冬，災民蔽體無衣，果腹無食，嗷嗷在野，瑟縮待僵，誰無父母誰無子女，以此例彼，人非木石，然則未受其害者，在道德上亟應本［已飢已溺］之誠，力爲援助者，方今各省冬防議起，無非謀閻閭之保障，然作奸犯科所以威脅冬防者，太半又皆飢寒所迫，不甘淪於溝壑所致耳。先哲有方，倉廪實而知廉恥，蒼蒼者氓，無非爲生，今果無術以生，則手段自不間擇，挺而走險，非伊之過，實環境使然，其行可憫，其情豈不可諒。是故吾人欲謀社會秩序安定，伏莽早靖，在方法上更應先從安撫災民問題着手也。至言謀圖禦侮，自强圖存，更非安定人民之生活，充實人民之力量，不足言救國。使如今日之中國，哀鴻遍地，必爲萑苻根株，抑爲亂源所自循，使安内不遑，攘外無日，此則民族的意識上，尤應亟予安輯，而引以爲當前之急務也。</p>
<p>惟是振災一事，中央固已積極籌劃，顧以目前庫存之支絀，用度之浩繁，又以救災所需之匪細，厥賴乎同胞之慨助。本市日前由吳市長等發起之普捐大運動，蓋卽本此數旨以喚起上海市民注意，而爲解囊先導，拯彼水火之意。今該會業已正式辦公，且於進行各項規劃綦週，衡以滬上過往振災捐助之熱烈，素爲全國各大都市景從，今又得市長登高一呼，深信成續必有可觀。惟吾人際此大募捐發軔，尚有一言者，卽希望市民方面固須深體發起人此舉之深意，慷慨樂捐，早頒仁漿，而經其事者，亦希手續更清，信用更著，聞今次募捐參加圑體逾十數，則於徵募手續如何，解欵手續如何，更須嚴密規訂，免貽物議，務達涓滴入微目的，使發起人之宏願爲不虚，亦所以促進振災效率之新，吾人於述及振災重要之餘、願不憚一致意焉！</p>

<p>參觀及聽講者八千餘人</p>
<p>今日爲最後一日之展覧</p>
<p>改良中式簿記成績展覧會、昨（二日）爲第二日、因係星期、且有名人演講、故到會參觀及聽講者、較第一日更爲擁擠、且有許多學校圑體參加、市商會大會塲及三樓各陳列室、因不能容納而退出者甚多、一日之中、參觀及聽講者、不下八千餘人、上午十時、開講演會、先由王延松氏致開會詞、繼由徐永祚氏報告改良中式簿記經過及意見後、各名人講演者、有商界聞人林康侯·王曉籟·秦潤卿·駱清華·諸氏、及南京審計部廳長林襟宇氏、其餘如商會主席俞佐庭·常委徐寄矉·國民政府主計處會計局局長聞亦有、及潘仰堯、盛灼二·計健南·陶樂勤·諸氏、亦均預備講演、惜因時已過午、臨時作罷、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>開會秩序　㈠振鈴開會、㈡全體肅立、向黨國旗及總理遺像、行最敬禮、㈢恭讀總理遺囑、㈣王延松先生致開會詞、㈤徐永祚先生報告改良中式簿記經過、㈥名人演講、㈦振鈴散會、</p>
<p>致開會詞　首由王延松氏致開會詞、略謂、會計與工商業、關係甚切、市商會責在助長工商業、關於工商業管理上各事項、素所注重、而會計即其一端、我國簿記不良、人所共知、市商會深覺有改良之必要、徐永祚會計師、亦同有此感、乃於今年合辦改良中式簿記講習科、現在第一　已畢業、對於工商界當有相當之貢獻、望畢業諸君、今後仍繼續努力、將改良中式簿記、發揚光大之、並出其　學、隨時隨地、　事於改良之實際工作、俾一般工商界、皆受其益、我國簿記、已有悠久之歷史、其長處原屬不少、惜向　通人以爲講習、以致蕪雜不定、大有碍於工商業之管理、自西　簿記傳入中國、雖似整齊有　、但理　　賾、費用浩大、而簿記人材、尤非短期訓練所可成就、對於一般簿記界、不易推行、以致中西二法、向不溝通、中式者不知西式之科學方法、西式者未明中式之習慣、我人欲求一中庸平易之法、祗有採用改良中式簿記法、且祗有推行改良中式簿記法、講習科諸君、應自覺使命之重、請到會諸名人、多多賜敎、以補講習之所不及、</p>
<p>報告經過　次山徐永祚會計師報告、略謂、自西式簿記傳入中國後、中式簿記之爲人鄙棄、蓋亦久　、但三四十年來、除銀行鐵路及新企業外、中式簿記之盛行如故、而其簡陋不完備亦如故、長此停留於此種狀態、其影響於國計民生者至巨、余雖學習西式簿記出身、近丨年來、感於西式簿記推行之不易、而中式簿記又難於廢棄主張因勢　導、改良中式簿記、自去冬將改良中式簿記方案、及專書公布後、頗引起全國上下之注意、去冬在市商會舉行展覧會及講演會、當時已有多數聽衆、要求辦講習科、而以事忙未果、本年以來、採用改良中式簿記者益多、要求辦講習科者益衆、爰與市商會商業學校校長嚴先生商定簡章、開辦本科、自七月下旬登報公告、未及旬日、來學者已八百餘人、因課堂已無法容納、祇得提早截止、於八月　日開學、每日授課一小時、兩個月完畢、爲時雖暫但來學者、大都能努力研究、故成績尚佳、還請到會諸君、多多指敎、</p>
<p>林康侯講　略謂、兄弟是一極老式之人、無論中式簿記·西式簿記·均未研究、但覺中西二　、各有短長、且各有適用之處、採用應酌量本身情形、不必以採用西式始爲新式也、且不必以學了一様、就算完全也、徐永祚會計師之改良中式簿記、摘取西式之科學精神、而融化之、沿用中式之固有習慣、而改良之、融會貫通、平易可行、兄弟雖爲老式人、也覺十分完善、頗可　得、或以横式直式之别、衡量中式西式之優劣、兄弟以爲不必、蓋在格式之本身上、横式直式、均有其相當之價值、不過我人向來讀書是讀直式的書、寫字也是寫直式的字、則覺中式簿記之直式、切於實用耳、現在提倡新生活、大家都很注意、其實新生活之　　、就是光復舊道德、對於西式簿記者、談改良中式簿記、未嘗不可作如此觀、又或以新式事業與舊式事業之别、評判中式西式之應用、兄弟以爲所見應遠大、中國全部情形、適於中式者何等廣漢、切不可　於若干都市之洋式組織也、徐會計師是吾老友、我雖不懂簿記學之玄妙、但覺其改良中式簿記、旣可懂得亦可行得、請大家共同提倡　　王曉籟講　略謂、吾人對於萬事萬物、如覺有不能適用或不切時代需要之處、均應加以改革、　所謂改革者、旣非固守舊法之意、亦　摹仿外國之意、譬如簿記、襲用固有方法而不變、即係守舊、完全採用西洋方法、即係摹仿、一者均屬非是、必須就固有方法、留其所長、去其所短、方足稱爲改革、然改革有改良改惡之分、必須改而　良、方合實用、如改而反恶、不如不改、徐永祚會計師之改良中式簿記、即係改而良者、吾人但問其改革之是否適當、致於方式如何、可不問也、</p>
<p>林襟宇講　略謂、我對於改良中式簿記、有、種感想、（一）一般人以會計爲末技、士大夫　恥言貨利、中國公私經濟之交困、與此不無關係、我自出國游　以至現在、此身未嘗一　離開會計界、處處　得會計之重要、有出於一般人想像以外者、但國内事業之能深切注意於此、卒未多見、甚能主持風會、以謀普遍之改良者、更屬無有、今幸得徐會計師將吾國固　之中式簿記、提倡改奶、何快如之、所以特地從南京趕來、參加盛會、（二）學理與事實、不可偏廢、中西式簿記、在學理上各有長處、但事實上應採用何種、則不容不加以酌斟、以現在而言、中國各地、應採用改良中式簿記者爲多、此蓋無容諱言、或謂實業之發達、由於需要、西式簿記如盛行、其筆墨紙張、中國自能出產、此說固有相當之理由、但不能爲目前言也、以我看來、科學適合時代爲原則、將來横式　帳、可以通行改良中式簿記、有漸進爲横式之可能、我見展覧會所陳列的東西非常之多、在帳表之中、有一種是横式的日核表、此即見其端歟、根據此二個感想、我覺談改良中式簿記、應顧及一切問題、如定名爲改良中國簿記則更妥善矣、</p>
<p>秦潤卿講　略謂商家無論大小、各有簿據記載、其中營業之盈虧、存欠之稽核、均惟帳簿是賴、我商家各業帳目不同、缺少系統、向承舊貫、不肯隨變更、詳註雖少醒　、然此中　點亦屬不少、近來歐風東漸、學尚西法、簿記　續雖繁、記載却較中式詳明、今徐會計師發起改良中式簿記、設校敎導、各處來學者、異常踴躍、可知此事之重要、且中國簿記法、自經徐會計師用去繁就簡提綱挈領之法、加以改良、已成爲條目分明、切合實用之模範簿記法、將來果能逐　推行於全國、一致採用、則誠堪爲吾國工商界額　稱慶也、</p>
<p>駱清華講　略謂、簿記爲社會科學之一種、應求其合理化、听謂其合理化、即能充分發揮其［效率］是也、而所謂［效率］、包括三大要素、一、凖確、二、簡捷、三、節省、茲就中式簿記與西式簿記之執能合乎、［效率］條件而言、中式簿記之　顯明瞭、節省費用、確爲西式簿記所不及、惟其缺點、則帳表無一定之格式、帳户無一定之分類、記帳無一定之法則、簡言之、即不合乎凖確之原則、而西式簿記、凖確則有之、簡明與節省則木必、故言改良簿記、莫善於取西式之長、補中式之短、徐會計師之改良中式簿記、即能合乎此種原則者、凡吾國人、自應同聲贊許、恊力提倡也、最後尚有一個報告、即兄弟最　參加立法院會議、議及商業登記法、關於商業帳簿一章、因鑑於中國簿記、法、尚未臻於完善、而西式簿記法、又不能有裨實用、主張俟徐會計師之改良中式簿記推行有成效時、再行採入法典、可見改良中式簿記、不特爲商界重視、政府亦頗知注　也、</p>

<p>今日起除圑體外須憑入場劵</p>
<p>（南京二日電）二日爲星期、各界前往爲參觀全國勞展者不絶、展會塲地狹小各省出品繁多、不敷陳列、乃將會塲人行道縮小、不及三尺、二人不能並行、初不料觀衆有萬人以上、致會塲擁擠、秩序不佳、成績品被擠倒者、各館均有、大會爲救濟計、乃於下午四時起、將入口門關閉、准出不准進、臨時改發入塲劵、發出緊急通告云、本展覧會、自三日起、一律憑劵入塲、除中小學另有參觀日程外、所有京内各機關及大學、均已致送入塲劵、請各向本機關領導、其餘各界、請於未蒞會前先到敎部傳逹處領劵、以憑入塲、凡未持劵者、恕不招待、並加派軍警、維持秩序、連夜將各館陳列品、加以整理、觀衆中如葉楚傖邵元冲等、均於評判簿上表示意見、</p>

<p>浙江　區域、該省出品最爲特色者有三、（一）爲蠶桑學校各種絲之標本、（二）爲定海小學國防設計單元及運動塲設計單元二具、國防單元下、有地圖軍艦砲台羅列其中、上有飛機飛艇、迥翔空際、一奇觀也、（三）爲油盡、剌秀精巧絶倫、職校方面、農校作物標本及工校機器標本甚多、中學紡紗模型及金華木製火腿模型等、頗有别緻、小學之物理像器、海產標本及敎學單元、如衣服那裏來的、毛織物是那裏來的等等、均特有研究之價值、其他金木竹石膏等等標本、約三千件、不及備述、由浙江向東北行抵</p>
<p>江西　區域、首先映入視官者、爲江西之瓷器、惜件數過少、不能蔚爲大觀、據代表虞君談、江西此次出品甚爲平常、蓋並未特爲參加展覧會而臨時加工製造之、成績品均係由平時成績、挑選而來、惟瓷器部份、實覺太少、不足以表示江西之特徵、現已電九江陶業學校、加選成績品、一二日内即可到京、届時當能飽飮都人士之眼福也云云、成績亦分職業中學小學三大部分、職業分、印刷皮革織布印染剌繡織蓆農作物蠶絲等、又有農校發明之孵化機及三草草殺虫粉、頗有價值、中學分金工木工通草工玩具籐蠟紙粘工石膏、縫紉等有自製地球像、木料標本天秤、捕鼠器、利用水力碾米同時灌漑之設計單元數學敎學敎具等、較有特色、小學分類與中學同、各種自製之練習簿、最有特色、全部出品、約十餘件、出第二館登樓至第三館後、明志樓第一部、係</p>
<p>安徵　區域　出品計三千餘件、最佳之成績品、均陳列於講台上、計有新村設計模型兩大匣、湘繡四幅、木製生理模型六付、其他各物種類繁多、與第一一館大略相同、小學部份之傢俱玩具、有系統說明程序、比較較易促人注意、由此折入</p>
<p>察哈爾　區域　本區成績品、最特色者爲毛線皮革及實用品、于籐樹蘆刷等各種日用家具、均切於實用、不求美觀、其他布疋玩具彫刻等亦略具、該省敎育基礎、遠遜於江南各省、有此成績、已屬不易矣、全部出品約一千件、</p>
<p>山西　之中小學勞作各工、均滿約八九百件、以農業出品最爲奇觀、如南瓜北瓜蕪菁馬鈴薯等、碩大無比、至米麥等種子、都甚可觀、</p>
<p>靑島　爲第三館精華、所在奚嚴兩君告余靑島市各校勞作注重家事科、其次因近海關係、故對於海產亦極注意、家事科出品最重要者、爲各種刺繡縫紉編織、故衣服椅墊等、均甚美麗、烹飪則有西式細點、海產標本種類繁多、目不暇接、鹽塲模型及全部農具模型、均爲單元設計、中學注重木工製造、各種實用家俱、此外金工紙工文具化學工藝等品甚多、小學以自製之科學儀器、最爲特色、編物中以草編各物最精美、全部出品約近千件、</p>

<h3 id="c152">勞展中所發現的問題吳研因 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>勞展、初期的勞展、我們對牠自然不應當著求全責備的意思、但是以我瀏覧一過而後所得的印象而言、除了積極方面的美不勝收、而且很有一點創造精神的表顯外、消極方面、却似乎也有幾個問題可以提出來研究、</p>
<p>（一）中小學的農事成績似乎太少</p>
<p>我國是農國、社會經濟尚未脫離農業時代、中小學丨尤其是小學和師範學校的勞作、似乎應當十分注意農事、因爲小學生不少農民子弟、師範畢業而爲農村導師的當也不在少數、注重農事、以使他們具有農事的知能、改良農業的理想和企圖、這是非常重要的、這次勞展中關於農事的成績、數量很少、可知實際注重農事的中小學、實在太少了、丨這或者因爲出品的多是城市中小學和市民的子弟、但是城市中小學也得有些　藝·畜養···等類的成績才是、</p>
<p>（二）中小學工藝成績似仍偏重纖巧的不件手工</p>
<p>這次出品、比了十多年前的手工成績、只是些折紙工、織紙工之類的、已經大不相同了、但是比較實用的出品、尚在少數、多數還是些小件的模型·玩具·文具之類、仍脫不了舊式手工的窠臼小學兒童固然只能守着、幼時做玩具、長大造飛機一的口號、但是年齡較長的小學生以及初中學生、師範生、就應當多做些大件的東四如家具校具之類、因爲勞作敎育的目標、最重的是養成兒童和靑年的勞動的身手、呌他們多出些汗、要是專注重織巧的小件手工、那仍和舊式書獃子的刻圖章、繪畫、習字差不多、充乎其量也不過勞手而已、身旣不勞、汗乎何有、</p>
<p>（三）中小學各種出品似多偏重美術化而還少生產意義</p>
<p>雖然也有許多實用而且大衆化的出品、如土產的農家用具之類、但是大多數的成績、仍似乎都在美的一方做工夫、生產的意義很少、美是工藝縫紉等的重要條件、但是過於求美、便一則多耗兒童和靑年的工夫和心血、而未必合乎經濟的原則、一則往往織巧而不實用、生產價值便不見多在展覧會中、爭奇鬥異、惟恐出品之不美、以期博得觀衆的讚歎、這是人們的普通心理、但勞作　是勞動的作業、勞　是勞作的覧品、最要緊的要不失生產敎育的意義、和美術、美術品絶不相同、要是刻意求工、不計工夫成本、又不見得可以出賣、</p>
<p>（四）少數地方的出品似乎不免濫雜</p>
<p>多數地方的出品、大體上都還在勞作與手工之間、而且也各有一點特色、仿製的儀器、有些竟與商品無異、敎具之類更多創造發明的意義、但是有些地方、不但出品很少、而且不免濫雜、例如採集的植物標本、以及由小學生收集的織物様子、……等、雖然製自學生、但是並非勞作課程範圍内的成績、又如非美術學校的繪畫、雕刻…之類也、居然當勞作成績、一例運來、這更出乎勞作的範圍之外了、在勞的辦事者、以爲如展將這類東西抽去、有些省分的勞作出品、未免更少、所以仍舊讓牠陳列、但是與勞展的意義、相去未免太遠、</p>
<p>以上四點、是我所覺到的犖犖大端、此外、有些出品任取外國的原料、有些出品做成外國的式様、有些出品似乎超出學生製作能力的範圍、未免令人懷疑、…這都是些小節、我可不多說了、我覺得這是初期出品應有的現象、我希望今後中小學對於勞作敎育注意改進、格外努力、據我的意思、今後努力的方面、</p>
<p>（一）中小學師範應當注重農事、至少要有些　藝之類的設施、</p>
<p>（二）中小學師範如果專重工藝、關於工塲的設備、務須完全、以便學生作較爲大規模的勞動實習、　　（三）中小學師範的勞作師資、應由各級師範學校注意養成以便改善勞作敎育、</p>
<p>（四）中小學師範的勞作課程標凖、應由各校切實注意實施、不要仍蹈舊式手工的陋習、</p>
<p>（五）中學勞作出品、應以生產爲原則、小學勞作品雖不盡能直接生產、但也多得有些生產的敎育意義、</p>
<p>至於職業學校出品、自然比較中小學出品整齊些、但是在重農的中國、農科職校、根本也就嫌太少、所以這次勞展中、農校的成績也不易令人注目、將來如何提倡多設農科職校、這是敎育行政者所當切實注意的、</p>
<p>出第三館沿梯而下　　績堂、即爲第四館所在地、入門一小室、爲中央大學實騐學校出品陳列處、轉入第四館、滿目輝煌、如臨大美術館、則所陳列者、爲</p>

<p>上海市出品（南京中華攝）</p>
<p>湖北　佔第四館之中央全部出品約千件、中供假山庭園一座、列機織物金工木工化學工藝等甚多、該省代表馬君以一人之力佈置、一切甚爲忙碌、木製之其艦模型籐字木版對聨、均甚精臻、由此轉入、</p>
<p>福建　陳列處、該處係在館之西北隅、精彩百出、最出風頭者、計有四種、（一）爲漆器係惠兒院出品、如花瓶人物圍屏盤盒杯等製、均甚精緻、該校係工讀性質、故學生對於手腦訓練、甚爲注意在閩出售漆器已佔重要地位、此次參加展覧會出品、約值四五千元之譜、（二）爲省立工業職業學校之投影、及建築標本此項標本製造凖確、爲工業學校最重要之像器、據云、如向外國購買每套約需千元、以上、現該校已能自製價值之廉、僅佔舶來品十分之一、（三）爲籐器、福建製籐有其悠久之歷史的籐器出品、遠非他省所能比、（四）竹器計書房客廳等全堂構造甚好、其陳方法、亦按各館標凖、職業方面、化學　　江蘇省小學出品（南京中華攝）</p>
<p>工藝農產製造品、天秤及其他金工物品、均係實際出售市上之物、女校抽絲各品、至爲摩登、中學金工木工……等約三千件以省立福州中學佔最大部份、小學各勞作品甚多、以住宅設計模型、竹工及自製各種儀器農具、體育用具爲佳、單元有二、（一）爲日光曝之鹽塲、及採桂圓之全部用具、爲該省因地制宜之敎材、用意亦甚可取、由此轉入、</p>
<p>廣東廣西　兩廣聯合戰綫、蔚成大觀肇慶草蓆、廣藤器用、久已負盛名、馳譽全國、學校能有此出品、足徵該省注重生產敎育也、職業所製蠶絲動物標本、有巨蟒等、金工有水泥鋼骨模型、女生之貼絨花屏、中學所製陶器、均爲該省特出良品、小學所製之桌琴、學校模型、布疋花様、均甚多、全部出品、約四五百件、</p>
<p>雲南　爲會塲陳列最後部份、出品僅有剌繡等數十件、但遠涉重洋參加展　、已屢不易、會塲至此、已告　止、　　　記者隨出塲外、計參加者二十六單位、出品約三萬件、綜計此次巡　、爲時雖僅數小時、然所得印像、極佳極深、慨夫吾國素以士爲四民之首、勞心者役人勞力者役於人、於是全國充滿學而優則仕之思想、所謂奇技淫巧謂之賤丈夫、所以產業落後、識者引爲隱憂、年來中央敎育當局極力提倡生產敎育、各地敎育專家亦能抱窮幹苦幹之精神、通力合作、乃有此偉大成績、此吾人所應致欽佩之忱者也、其次各地職業學校出品及中小學勞作品、均漸趨實用化、不若從前徒事點綴、以愽得少數藝術家之欣賞、而各種自製敎具及設計單元、均能充分表現、今日敎學之進步、此其尤足欽佩者、自九一八之後、全國國民均具同仇敵愾之心理、各省出品兵器佔重部分可見敎育界同人注重國防敎育矣、深望全國各界對於此會特别重視、以矯正過去做官敎育之誤謬、則此會雖費數萬人之心血、將俱不朽之價值矣、（完）</p>

<p>優游前鋒聯絡純熟</p>
<p>法商雖勇拜甘下風</p>
<p>邇來優游足球隊、旣挫猶太、又敗西商、士氣振作、聲威並茂、昨日與上届西聯甲組冠軍法商會、會師於申園、優游挾戰勝餘威、人人奮勇、縱然法商整頓隊伍、起用老將、但結果仍以五比二歸優游勝利、黄龍直搗、個個稱快、從此中興、希望無窮、</p>
<p>優游前鋒、並未調動、聯絡上漸臻佳境　勇森大有曹桂成之風、奔馳竄突、衝鋒破陣、可爲全鋒中之首選、可惜楚材晋用、改任右内鋒、在優游可謂得計、然在其個人、實不足以盡展所長、梅洪寳之右翼、屢誤戎機、鮮有可取、王南珍之左翼、漸見爐火純靑之妙、假以時日、當不在萬象華之下、係羅二將一如往昔、不愧名將、前後衛均覺稱職、江善敬已較前鎭靜、脚頭亦見正着、如再多多涵養、不難恢復舊觀、</p>
<p>上届冠軍法商、不料在本季中、一無作爲五戰二敗、極現不景氣狀態、谷史泰柯萊脫之倦勤實爲重大打擊、俱他各將、亦每不能如期出塲且、黄花老去、威風不再、作戰優游、果然老將雲聚、如雷米狄派克麥山兒等第一流好手均到、較之去年得錦標之陣綫、僅少谷斯泰及柯萊脱二人、守門福祿壽與昨日之華特、原在伯仲之間、論人材、實在優游之上、不意反遭敗衂、寗非寄事、陣容散漫、精神萎頓、實爲致敗之主因、然則優游之勝、亦可謂本季之奇績矣、</p>
<p>登塲時、法商將尼古洛夫改任前衛、而與麥山兒拆擋、大爲失計、蓋麥尼　將爲内衛之老搭擋、今以琴生調任内衛、與麥山兒不能互通聲氣、留一破綻、優游前鋒大爲猖狂、王南珍之遇琴生、如入無入之境是以優游前鋒聲勢、每得力於王、上半時成三比一之結果、下半時法商即以尼古洛夫調任原職、與琴生對調、後防稍見鞏固、形勢亦　平衡各得二球、成五比三終局、</p>
<p>優游面日開球、出兵不利、法商風捲而來、前鋒十分猖獗、飽沙脫小華特兩次扣關、非常緊激、幸而不中、罷兵而還、優游追擊、悔光錦順勇森三將、包抄而上聯絡美妙、球爲梅洪寳得、遙送門前、當中三將均不及趕上、王南珍見機而作、如飛追至、一頂人門、清晰可觀、大張得勝之鼓、於商心殊不甘、派克　球闖進、單騎刦營、着地急射、徐亨不慌不忙、俯身接住、化險爲夷、</p>
<p>孫錦順在中央得球、傳至前方、勇森居中策應、王南珍重演故技、衝上頭頂、惜被琴生擋住、勇森兩次斜射、亦未中的、旋見梅洪寳接得鎭鮮來球、被麥山兒刦去、梅再由麥山兒脚上奪回、傳向門去、勇森地位不佳、不能發脚、乃挑後送與老孫、時門前密佈雙方戰將、孫欲射不能、又輕挑與勇森、鍾脚步不凖、順勢一撥、海光候個正着、拉起一脚、敵門又陷、優游乃連勝兩球、</p>
<p>法商連陷兩城、力舉反攻、飽沙脫大華特雙騎刦營、其勢汹汹、江善敬極力周旋、李省官一脚解危、一波方平、一波又起、小華特邊疆舉義、穿過江善敬、至底綫傳中、法凡怯如飛將軍破空而下、迎頭頂、射透門角、如迅雷不及掩耳、徐亨王樹森瞠目而視、無可奈何、從此法商形勢、略見轉機、小華特冉渡陳倉、鮑沙脫從中接濟、大華特在門邊猛射、可惜一飛冲天、無功而還、兇游脫離覊拌、繼續進攻、但梅洪寳二次傳中、均無力道、陳鎭祥接得麥山兒還出之球、再還至門前、海光故意放過、勇森會意、力射中鵠、成三比一、終了上半時、</p>
<p>再戰聲起、西人觀衆因不滿裁判員陳吉祥、時起喧嘩、華人觀衆、羣起責難、唇槍舌劍、閙個不休、不料正在擾攘之際、優游忽負一球、由鮑沙脫攻入、離下半時開賽僅三分鐘耳、優游意殊不甘、立刻興師問罪、勇森身入險地射門斜踢、法商守門臥地擋住、洪寳從邊陲抄進、勇森飛　刦得、高送門前、孫羅二將均未接得、王南珍衝上頭頂、可惜未中、時雙方攻勢、均甚緊激、法商自尼古洛夫調任内衛後、防禦鞏固不少、前鋒亦驟見兇猛、互有驚險、一次孫錦順單槍匹馬、帶球衝進、麥山兒隨後窮追、尼古洛夫横裏趕上、老孫見勢不佳、發脚射門、仍被守門救出、</p>
<p>法商兵臨城下、江善敬頭頂失誤、大華特對門力射、由球門彈回、徐亨奔出撲空、小華特再射、王樹森截住、梁樹棠再加一脚、傲倖脫險、優游不負此球、可謂大幸、大難不死、必有後福、優游旣不負此球、霎時間竟得罰十二碼球機會、因勇森帶球進攻、麥山兒自不小心、以手觸球、被罰十二碼、孫錦順牛刀小試、一踢功成、禍福無常、法商眞是倒運、</p>
<p>鍾勇森馬不停蹄、勞苦功高、殺出殺進、威風凛凛、又見其匹馬衝殺、傑蘇抬架不住、鍾進至相當地位、門側斜射、守門臥地救之、手指觸及、球仍溜出、緩緩向門滾去、不意着門柱出界、王南珍角球發來、落點甚佳、海光頭頂、老孫不待球之落地、乘空順勢鈎射、球如强弩射出、飛入門内、功夫不少、時時間射終、在最後二分鐘内、糊裏糊塗之間、被法商亦射中一球、遂以五比三鳴金收軍、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　饀笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴　腸　追敷粉學風流</p>
<p>小紀點頭笑道：那也好，明日上午，我帶來罷。本來也可以約到下午的，可是那也時間太長了，說着一笑而去。在他這一笑中，似乎有點和賈多才開玩笑的意味在内。賈多才想看那女孩子，却也是眞，人家說了，倒也不能否認，不過覺得這個茶房，不好應付，倒要提防一二而已。小紀的心事，正也和他一様，覺著這個有錢的人，非同旁人，輕易胡弄不到的，要好好的着手。當時把旅館裏的事，清理了一部份，這就抽身到胡嫂子家裏來。窮人捨不得點燈油，天黑了，就摸到坑上去躺着，雖然一時睡不着，頭靠了枕頭，也可以想想，什麽時候可以在坑底下挖到一窖銀子。這時，胡嫂子在坑上想挖窖的事，正想得有點迷迷糊糊的時候，却聽到外面劈劈拍拍有人打着門晌，正吃了一驚，莫不是捉歹人的軍警，光顧到這裏來了吧？因之雖然聽到，却躺在坑上，死也不敢作聲。後來小紀直呌出胡嫂子來，懂得聲音了，這才敢問一句有什麽事。小紀一肚子的計策，可不是大聲可以嚷出來的，便道：你旣是睡了，不妨明天早上對你說你不要忘了，一早就去找我，有一塊錢的買賣好做呢。胡嫂子口裏呌着紀大哥慢走，跪在坑上，兩手就去亂抓衣服。他發急道：衣服那裏去了呢，誰拿了我的？紀家大哥，你稍微等等，我就來了。喲！這是褲子，我當褂子穿了，怪不得穿不起來呢。紀大哥，你站一會兒我就來了。他低聲急，高聲呌人，足忙了一陣子（七九）</p>

<p>某一天，跟了朋友上某交易所去觀光。</p>
<p>在市塲裏，人是擁擠得我沒有適當的字句，足以形容了。在這人堆裏的人們，不住的你推我搡。可憐，哪，被推被搡的除了順勢把全身的力點，去支持在前後或左右的人們的胸前背後，而給前後或左右的人，再推推搡搡的倒向另一方面去之外，雖然你要用腿裏的勁兒，把你的身子，支持在穩固些兒地位上，是休想的。好在擠你搡你的人，也就是被人擠，被人搡着，而同時呢，你雖被人擠，被人搡，你也儘可把人用力的擠，用力的搡。好在到了這所在，擠擠搡搡，是並不算怎麽的一回事。</p>
<p>幾十個所謂經紀人的代理人也者，跳着，蹤着，一壁裝着手勢，一壁不住的嚷着［二角］，［三角］，［四角］本來在交易的市塲裏，是充滿着瘋狂的氣味的，而這些跳着蹤着的代理人，更是十足地表示着瘋狂的狀態。可是經了此輩代理人的一度發狂之後，市價是變動了。於是市塲裏立卽發生着一種可怖的騷動。你沒命的把我擠，我沒命的把你搡。勝利者哈哈大笑，失利者頓足挺胸。人類本來的面目，在這裏是完全顯露了出來。</p>
<p>我總是不信，在這推推搡搡，跳跳蹤蹤，閙閙嚷嚷的氛圍裏，可由赤貧而成富翁，可由富翁而成赤貧。但是在市塲裏，任何人却都給麻醉得瘋狂了。</p>

<p>［靠着兩片嘴唇，並無眞實本領。說得天花亂墜。騙取銅錢正經。］這便是［江湖訣］的鐵板註脚。</p>
<p>廣塲上圍着許多人，賈拳頭的朋友，要了幾套花拳繡腿，引得瞧的人拍手呌好。他便拿出一盤子膏藥，說是世代秘傳，不論跌打損傷，一貼便會痊瘉。看客們給他說得動心，竟很情願掏出錢來，買他幾張，備而不用。若問這膏藥到底靈不靈：那只有［天知地知自己知］的了。</p>

<p>— 黄克威</p>
<p>有一個時候人們都憧憬着一個黄金的美夢，那就是［到南洋夫挖座金山呵，］每年給這句富有誘惑力的說話吸去做鑛工的不在少數，但誰看見有一個鑛工挖了座金山回來呢？有的永遠被軟禁在鑛山上做着苦工，有的被榨乾了血汗，連一副骨頭都埋在鑛穴裏了！年來整個世界陷入了不景氣的現象，那金色的南島也在所不免，鑛工的待遇更其殘酷了！</p>
<p>在鑛山上難得有幾天晴朗的日子，老是那麽陰沉沉的彌滿着潮濕的氛氣。每天，東方還沒有大亮的清早，幾個鑛警便吹着口哨來了，這尖厲的聲音把躺在爐旁裏的鑛工們剌醒了，連忙支起那沒有經過充分休息的疲倦的身子，胡亂地揩個臉，吃幾塊又粗又髒的麫餅，背上一隻麻布袋，提把鶴嘴鋤和鎂光燈，便怱怱的鑽出屋去。在鑛警的監視下，大家排了一條整齊的行列，拖着沉重的脚步去工作了。鑛警的模様兒很凶恶，渾身武裝，腰裏揷着剌刀和木殼槍、背上還肩一支長槍，眼珠子怪怕人的釘住每一個工人，如果走得慢些，或是跟同伴拉扯幾句，硬挺挺的槍桿便會狠命的挨着你的背上，腿上，可是不能喊一句痛，不然，槍桿子就連續的挨打上來。</p>
<p>如果是新來的鑛工，恐怕他熬不住苦逃走，所以還得釘上一副粗重的脚鐐，走路時擦朗擦朗地交響着，感到非常的痛苦，但一走進鑛山去做工是沒法子違抗的！而且也休想逃，四面八方都有鑛警監視着，溜一溜脚，槍子早已彈進腦殼去了！一直到五年後才把脚鐐脫去，到那個時候已經給消磨得服服貼貼，而生活也過慣了，不會想逃，但走起路來總是八字式的一搖一擺着，脚鐐的烙印，是永遠不能磨滅的了！</p>
<p>鑛穴是深深地埋在地下，工人們要傴僂着背爬進洞去；裏面是那様的黑暗，潮濕，於是點亮了鎂光燈，慢慢的爬着，一縷一縷的臭烟散播開來，把汚濁的空氣弄得異常的窒息，使每一個人喘不過氣來。好容易爬到那工作的地方，（這兒比較高寛一點。）人們便安放了鎂光燈，鼓着全身的力氣去揮動鶴嘴鋤，把鑛土一塊一塊的打落下來，裝進麻布袋。等到裝滿，才背在肩上一步挨一步地爬出洞去，第二批人，就接替着爬進來。這様輪流工作到黄昏，人們才拖首疲憊的身子回去吃頓夜飯，休息一會兒，又得趕着去做夜工了。</p>
<p>每天，他們只吃得一頓糙米飯，一些鹹蘿葡乾，靑菜，大荳是永遠不變的小菜。鑛工們身上都掛着一塊刻有號碼的銅牌，彼此喚着號碼招呼的，姓名倒反給遺忘了。在鑛穴裏工作，大家都担心着炸裂和漲水的危險，一碰到發生這不幸的事變，人們只好閉着眼睛等死，一點辦法沒有！但這對於鑛主們似乎毫無憐憫，死了一大批，就另有一大批工人爭先來塡補缺額的呵！</p>
<p>鑛工的生活永遠是黑暗，痛苦，而那陰沉沉鑛穴裏不知埋葬了多少憧憬着黄金美夢的骷髏，但僅僅只吃飽了那挺胸凸肚的鑛主！</p>

<p>可惜我們都不曾合上眼皮，伊說話時的神情已很顯明地告訴我們：這兩代的皇帝，實在因爲年份隔得太久，對於太后已不能再有什麽眞切誠懇的影象了。伊只是把他們當做廟裏的神佛一様看待，隨便給他們揑造些支離附會的神話而已。可是這殿上所堆放着的遺物，却眞不少：有一大部份是他們所穿過袍服，五顏六色的堆了好幾箱，倒像是戲班子裏用的戲箱；還有許多是他們生前所佩帶過的用寳玉或珍珠鑲嵌的戒指，都用玻璃盒盛着；還有不少的碗碟器皿，據說都是這兩位已死的大皇帝的食具。雖然這些東西全是非常普通的，論價值並不如何珍貴，但用來作爲紀念品，却確有使後輩們見了發生幾許睹物思人的感想的力量。</p>

<h3 id="c173">農業推廣問題 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 黄枯桐</p>
<p>農業推廣這個名詞，據我的記憶，在我國通用起來，不過是十零年光景。說到牠的涵義，隨着個别的主觀，廣狹二義都可以。但有一普遍的見解，就是以農業推廣爲改良農業底手段，這當屬於狹義的解釋。若把農政底實施，看作農業推廣，則爲廣義的解釋了。民國二十二年三月二十九日實業部，敎育部，内政部·會同公布的［修正農業推廣規程］（原來的［農業推廣規程］是在十八年五月公布施行）第一條：［國民政府爲普及農業科學智識，增高農民技能，改進農業生產方法，改善農村組織，農民生活及促進農民合作起見，依本規程之規定，實施農業推廣。］觀此規定，不言而喻地，是屬於農業推廣底廣義的解釋了。廣狹二義，何者爲宜？講求起來，自有話說。然此却非本篇所欲討究，而且推廣問題的焦點，亦不在乎此，故今存而不論。</p>
<p>不論是廣義地或狹義地實行農業推廣的事體，其主要的前提，在我看來，不外（一）有什麽東西，足以推廣出去？（二）應該在怎様的時間和空間，去實行推廣的工作。（三）如何纔能够獲得推廣的實效？這些我認爲是很重要而應加討論的問題。換句話說，一是屬於推廣的材料問題；二是推廣的環境問題：三則爲推廣的技術問題。現在把這三項，簡要地述我個人的意見於下。</p>
<p>據我所知到，農業推廣一事，往往有不問其貨色靠得住靠不住，又是否有其需要，便貿貿然大推而特推的，這實在是一椿危險的行爲。怎麽說呢？</p>
<p>我國的農業，誰都明白，非改良不可，今以推廣行爲去謀農業改良底實現，理所當然，事亦應該。但是如果徒鶩於推廣底美名，行廣告式的誇張，而不先自審查自己的貨色，就是不先自檢討其所用以推廣的東西，是否貨眞價實，而又爲農業徑上的所需要。那麽，結果所至，犠牲必大，不獨不能達到農業改良的目的，反而會惹起農民的惡感，拒絶，影響到傍的推廣工作和一切農政的施行。所以用以推廣的東西，除了須先考慮其各種客觀的條件外，首當經過相當時期的研究，試騐，以確定其推廣材料底眞實性，然後才能推而且廣，獲得實際的效果。所以推廣和研究，具着密切的關係，並且研究一事，千萬不可以在短時間及局部地所得的結果，即行大推而特推，致弄巧反絀，阻塞推廣的大道。譬如推廣各種的改良種，首當問這個改良種，是否確實可靠，而具有其普遍妥當性？如果還在懷疑態度當中，則不應該遽然推廣，免得犧牲。說到此地，我們就常常感覺到我國現時的農業研究機關和農業推廣機關，未免缺乏聨絡的機能和統一的意識，大有研究自研究，推廣自推廣底情况，這是亟應改善的一椿事件。申言之，推廣機關宜乎取材於研究機關，得到眞實可靠的貨色；而研究機關，則當諮詢推廣機關，以資决定研究的步驟，這様同驂並進，始能得到改良底效果。</p>
<p>農業受着時，地的限制，即其時季性與地方性有顯著的作用。農業改良上必須先行考察這兩種性質，設法子去適應或克服牠，事理淺顯，不消多說。但是事實上，却有不顧一切而行其推廣工作的。譬如推廣棉種於非產棉區，結果是徒勞而無功。况且除了時地的天然條件應加考察外，還有經濟的社會條件，對於農業底支配力，尤爲不可忽視。譬如在蠶絲經濟陷於極度的衰敝當中，去推廣栽桑事業，結果亦是徒勞而無功啊。總之推廣一事，不能全憑　觀，應以農業的客觀的環境爲前提，深謀遠慮，避免犧牲，纔是正辦。有些專攻農業自然科學的人，往往否認或不明瞭經濟的社會條件，徒以其研究所得，亟謀推而廣之，這未免是科學的遊戲了。中國的農業，已經形成爲世界的農業之一環，其中的興衰消息，日見紛繁，如果閉着眼睛關起大門來實施農業推廣，未免滑稽之至！</p>
<p>農業推廣底對象，是以農民爲主，假使農民否定一切，那麽，推亦推不動，更何從而廣呢。所以農民能够接受推廣的工作與否，實爲一大問題。誰都知到，我國的農民，大多數是愚昧而守舊，自私而固執，對於新的事體，總是懷疑，不易接受，然而這並非絶對不能改變的性根，若果推廣工作，確能使到農民獲得利益，自何樂而不爲。據我所知，有些推廣的事體，實未嘗顧到農民本身的利益，亦並沒有考慮到他們的經濟力怎様，徒然粉飾，舖張甚至於期朦，高壓，那麽，農民的反感，排斥，自屬勢所必至的了。所以依我的思慮，農業推廣一事，除了應該先行考慮到推廣的材料推廣的環境這兩個問題以外，推廣實施上的技術問題，亦屬重要得很。這是人的問題，絶對不容忽視。有了東西，得了機會，還要有好好的人去推，否則目的不達，反得惡果。農業推廣實施上的組織，歸根亦屬人的問題，（當然不能丢掉經費問題）。農校的畢業生去幹推廣的工作，自是最好不過，然而那些都會化了的人，却不相宜。徒有書本上的智識，缺乏實地經騐的亦不行。對農民無同情心，鄙棄鄕村生活，而不能耐勞吃苦的，尤其不行。這様說來，要找到一批適當的推廣人員，委實不容易，推廣機關的上層組織，儘管如何的完備，若果缺乏了下層工作的好角色，則所謂農業推廣，徒有其名，且不免官僚化，農民對此，還是不關痛癢啊。至於談到推廣人員的訓練問題，道亦不是三兩個月加以書本智識的灌注或特别問題的講演，便算成功的了。我以爲最好是在農村中實地去訓練，就是選取一些適當的農校畢業生，由有經騐的先進的推廣人員，領導他們到農村去，完全過着農村的生活，作實地的訓練，養成一批具有忠厚的氣質，勤勞的習慣，確切的智識以及實際的經騐底推廣人員出來，然後使其擔當某村某種的推廣工作。我相信這様子訓練出來的人，比較初出校門的學生要好得多，農民對他們亦必然信用得多。但是這様的人員，千萬不可孤立地做工作，一面應受推廣機關的指揮，一面應與其他機關（如區鄕公所，農村小學校之類）聯絡，去謀農民的福利。如此其責任重大，工作煩勞，應該給以優厚的待遇，使得安心努力，久於其位。旣有了適當的人，那麽，各種的推廣工作，像育種底示範，病害底防除等等一切農業改良的事體，當不難循序漸進，得到預期的結果。</p>
<p>上面簡要地說了農業推廣上，我認爲重要的材料，環境和技術三個問題。這三件事體，互相聯繫，亦可單獨地分開來看。三者聯繫而適合，推廣才有把握。現時各地的農業推廣，大都不能獲得良好的成績，固然經費缺少，是一大原因，而與我上面所述的三個問題尤爲有關係。儘管經費籌得十分充足，章程定得怎様漂亮，機關裝得如何當皇，倘若上面述的三個問題，不得到圓滿的解决，農業推廣還是不行，這是我個人的偏見。至於推廣工作，應該系統地繼續地幹，自不消說了。</p>
<h3 id="c174">日本生絲業之檢討（續） <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 凌文欽</p>
<p>考日本絲業之成功，雖有賴於貿易之精密及製造技術之優良，然其根本乃在蠶業，而蠶業之非常成績，不得不歸功於敎育普及與政界之努力也。我國近年以來，雖用種種方法，勸告農民，使用科學育蠶，然收效不大，亦正受缺乏敎育之苦，事雖必成，尚須假以時日也。　　日本經營絲廠，以過去努力，一切困難，掃除將盡，不若我國廠家之處處受人留難。一九三一年以來。出口商不得再事吹毛求疵，中間人省去許多交涉之煩，蓋日絲出售，須一律經由國立生絲檢查所檢定，分别等級，授以證書，按市定價交貨，毫無爭執可言。雖出口商籍口美國機户之不能承受此種制度，然案已執行，萬無更改之理，　近有在東京催開生絲分級委員會之說，以便重訂生絲等級。此會出席者，包含美國用户，日本出口商，製絲家及世界生絲有關係國之代表。</p>
<p>在日本普通貿易，均屬公開，例如今日某貨成交若干，何人買進，次日報紙，均詳載無遺。是以生絲經紀人（我國之掮客）往出口商家，必携其貨品詳目，如得同意成交，即可簽定成單而將此項貨目抹除，以示成交，故一日間營業幾何，一望而知也。</p>
<p>至於收買原料，繭價標準，由政府按市檢定，上中下等級，依之升降。廠商計算成本，因之利便。日製絲家於收繭時期，視爲營業之生死關頭，蓋其全期需用原料，均於此短暫時間中選定之，彼時之主持人，旣須注目於横濱紐約二市塲之市况情形，另一方面，使用其靈敏手段，致電其收繭人員，採辦何等之繭，最爲有利，而定取捨。其收繭人員，以評貨員　爲重要，非老練而有深切經騐者，不克勝任，蓋盈虧之權，全在彼一人掌握之中也。日本製絲界對於成本計算·重於［掛］數，（Ｋａｋａ即系ｉ數），猶如我國之於［折頭］而更正確。例如今日標凖繭價，其含絲量（Ｍｏｍｅｒ）百分之十二者爲三圓，即知爲二十五［掛］（三圓乘一○○除十二之答數）再以一六乘之，（日本十六貫合一担）乃知每担生絲原料成本爲四○○圓，另加繅工若干·即得每擔生絲成本之價，依此而計，永不變更，如展望以後市况無上升希望，可在交易所預抛遠期，稍得微利，得落續交貨無慮矣。計算成本之方式如下，</p>
<p>３·００×１００</p>
<p>１１＝２５　１６×２５＝４００</p>
<p>生絲價值之每况愈下，雖受世界不景氣影響，而美國消用日减，以及人造絲發達之競爭，日本絲之過度發展，以致生產餘剩，乃本因也。設或世界產絲各國，妥恊提携，限止生產，以期產消適當，售價或可見高。際工商戰時代，我存你亡，何來此事實乎。試參閱下列數字，日本絲業之困難，正十倍於我人，生產方面，一九三二年比一九二三年加多十分之四强，而價值反低落十分之四，負此虧者，非農民即製絲家耳。</p>

<p>我人所注目於日絲，而欲與之競爭者，乃器械生絲，即日本對外出口生絲也。一九二九以來，歲產六十二萬包以上，同時美國全年消耗尚不滿六十萬包。依此計算，日本器械絲產額，足供美國統年需用，尚可運歐銷售，是以生絲過剩，早已發生於五六年前：惜彼時我國絲廠業，正大黄金時代，無人注意及之耳。日人爲利於對外貿易，一九三一年來，不惜其貶圓價，津貼匯兌損失，生絲輸出，得以暢行無阻，所苦者，華絲自此以後，遂入於沒落之途矣。余旣悲華絲生路之絶，亦不禁爲日人興滄桑之感。試觀其生產日增，價格日廉，不識將何以補救之。</p>

<p>在這幼稚工業的中國，在輕工業的製造中，火柴工業可說是件很重要的工業，全國火柴廠有百餘家，直接間接依賴而生活的人達數十萬；無論社會是怎様的進化，新陳代謝，火柴自從十九世紀發明以來，在一切應用上，仍保持着它固有的地位，並且從各方面來加以觀察，證之火柴的應用將日趨繁多，而社會的消費額將繼續增加；我國的火柴工業雖時在風雨飄零之中，不足稱根深蒂固，但已有悠久的歷史是無可否認的。在現階段的中國工業，一切都呈着凋敝·衰落·破產的現象，火柴工業當然不能例外，亦無可奈何的走入了它的危運，内則同業傾軋，外則洋貨傾銷，以致衰落不振，日趨危殆，若非努力設法救濟，使逐漸臻於佳境，而爲我國之幼稚工業建立一個鞏固的基礎，則恐在貧乏工業中梢有地位的火柴工業，亦將隨農業，棉紗業而由衰落瀕於破產矣！</p>
<p>查我國最初之火柴，都由外國輸入前清同光年間我國所用火柴，大都由歐洲輸入，至光緒二十二年，始有日本火柴輸入，日本的主要輸出港爲大阪·神户·其所出火柴，銷行於東三省·北方·及長江一帶，一時頗爲獲利，及後日人根据馬關條約，變本加厲，在我國通商口岸，設廠製造；彼時我國一般有識之士，鑒於金錢外溢，和權損失，及以火柴工業規模較小，經營較易，所以亦紛紛集資設廠，最先有四川重慶之聚昌火柴公司成立，故該公司實爲吾國火柴業之嚆矢。自是以後，國内各省都有火柴廠的設立，如漢口有爕昌火柴公司設立，長沙有和豐火柴公司設立，上海亦有爕昌火柴公司設立。及至歐戰爆發，五四運動以後，民衆紛起抵制日貨，並鑒於振興實業，挽回利權的刻不容緩，國内火柴廠的成立，一時風起雲湧，有如雨後春筍，駸駸乎有取舶來品而代之之勢，那個時期，可說是火柴業的黄金時代；但一過此時期，卽每况愈下，一蹶不振，資本較大的火柴廠尚强作鎭靜，資本較小的則皆捉襟見肘，窘態畢露，截止二十二年度，無法維持而倒閉的小廠家，已有拾餘家。</p>
<p>我國火柴業的逐漸衰落，自民國十六年起，至十七十八兩年，情形甚爲危殆，岌岌有不可終日之勢，及至民國十九年，爕昌·中華·鴻生·裕生·四火柴廠開始合併，大中華火柴公司成立後，市價逐步回跌，一時頗有復興氣象；至二十年底，各廠皆有盈餘，因此二十一年中，新火柴廠成立　，不在少數，据火柴業中人計算，民國二十一年國内火柴商標增九十二種，火柴廠增十一家，國内通都大邑，皆有增設，總計有百餘家，茲分佈狀况如下：</p>
<p>地名　廠數　地名廠數地名廠數地名廠數湖南一</p>
<p>山東　一九　廣東　五吉林　六遼寧　五江西一</p>
<p>江蘇　九　四川　九河北　六河南　四廣西一</p>
<p>浙江　四　雲南　四山西　三福建　三貴州一</p>
<p>陜西　二　甘肅　二安徽　二湖北一黑龍江一</p>
<p>此百餘家中，當以大中華火柴公司資本最厚，規模最大，該公司現有資金二百萬元。其次如濟南振業公司，青島華北公司，澳門日日公司，北平丹華公司，杭州光華公司等，均有資本額二十萬元至一百萬元。其中產量亦以大中華最大，每月約可產一萬箱，每箱五十羅，年產六百萬羅左右，合全國廠家，每年可產百萬箱；但經專家估計，全國每年火柴消數，不過六十餘萬箱，七十萬箱尚不至，如將蘇浙皖魯湘鄂贛七省生產情形而論，二十年七月至二十一年六月，火柴產量共計五六二，○○○箱，二十一年七月至二十二年六月增至七○○，○○○箱一年間總計七省產量增加十四萬箱，但七省之火柴消費額，尚無如此迅速之增加，致造成火柴之過剩局面；我人固已知道，求過於供，則物價上升，供過於求，則物價低落，此爲經濟學上千古不易之定理；是故火柴之市價大爲低落，据調查，民國廿一年三月上等大盒火柴每箱五十九元，二等中盒每箱五十元，三等中盒每箱四十八元，至廿二年七月，上等大盒火柴每箱跌至四十七元，二等中盒每箱跌至三十八元，三等中盒每箱跌至三十四元，但銷路仍未見充暢，大廠尚勉强維持，小廠規模簡小的大都不堪維持，宣告倒閉，即未告倒閉者，亦痛苦萬分，或被外商收買，或凖備倒閉，故火柴業之現狀，危殆萬分，較之十七十八兩年岌岌不可終日者實過之而無不及！</p>
<p>查我國之火柴工業所以一蹶不振，而日趨衰落，其主要原因，固爲廠商大量生產，漫無限制，以致生產過剩，市價低落，然外國火柴商有系統的施行傾銷政策，企圖獨占火柴市塲，而與華商火柴劇烈競爭，亦爲陷華商火柴於過剩的主要原因。溯外商火柴於同光年間，即有歐洲火柴，首先輸入我國，入後即有日本火柴輸入，及在華設廠製造，自是歐洲火柴，日見减少，及至歐戰爆發，歐洲火柴輸入我國者，幾告絶跡，歐戰告終，方始復有歐貨東來，但爲數甚少，民國八年，瑞典火柴輸入我國，僅銀二·九六○兩，但入後增加甚速，突飛猛進，至足驚人，其中以瑞典火柴居多數。茲將近十年外商火柴進口數量及價值列下：</p>
<p>年度　進口數量（單位羅）　進口價值（單位兩）</p>
<p>民國十二年　二·一四一·一二六　　九三　四二二</p>
<p>十三年　二·七三四·八八三　一·一二０·八二八</p>
<p>十四年　二·八五五·二九六　一·一五三·一三一</p>
<p>十五年　三·七０三·一三０　一·四五五·八七０</p>
<p>十六年　六·０二五·八五０　二·四五二·一三二</p>
<p>十七年　六·四二六·九六六　二·一七三·七四三</p>
<p>十八年　八·四一二·六四二　三·三一六·二四二</p>
<p>十九年　八·五０八·一九四　三·六六四·０六一</p>
<p>二十年　二·五二五·一二五　一·一六一·三七四</p>
<p>廿一年　　　三六六·五八八　　　二三二·七三五</p>
<p>廿二年（十月）　　　　　　　　　六一·二七八</p>
<p>觀此歷年火柴進口統計，自民國十二年起，增加甚速，民國十六年較十五年幾增一倍，至十九年度最高，達關平銀三·六六四·○六一兩，但自二十年起火柴進口即大减，約爲十九年三分之一，蓋二十年一月起實行新稅率，增高關稅後，對外商火柴課以百分之四十之稅率，致進口减少，數字低减，此種現象，於表面觀之，固然外貨進口减少，華商火柴得以抬頭；但事實則不然，蓋外國火柴商眼見中國政府提高關稅，火柴之成本，不得不隨之而水漲途高，售價旣高，彼將無利可圖，於是乃改良船徑，一變火柴進口而在華設廠製造，旣免運輸水脚等費用，又省進口繳納關稅，致外商在我國設立火柴廠者，不在少數。加以外商資金雄厚，機械精良，出品旣速，物又優良；二十二年豫魯之火柴產量，外商佔百分之一八·六，蘇浙皖外商佔一三·五，其勢之盛，不可一世。並且外商在華設廠製造火柴·背後皆有政府之資助，故雖出品精良，遠在華商火柴之上，但售價之低廉，却還在華商火柴之下，外商火柴每箱約低四五元五六元不等，但每箱平均售價，不過四十元左右，幾賤十分之一强，其欲獨占市塲，而置華商火柴於死地，由此可見其用心之一班。華商火柴處在此緊急存亡關頭，設再因循蹉跎·不謀救濟，則外商火柴將攫取我國市塲，而華商火柴去破產之路恐不遠矣。</p>
<p>以言今日火柴工業之救濟，實非易事，外則勁敵當前，内則同業傾軋，是故如何打倒此當前之强敵·如何謀避免同業間之傾軋，實爲救濟火柴業之二大問題，藍外商火柴而能打倒，國產火柴自可抬頭，同業間之傾軋避免，自可和衷共濟，共謀發展。愚以爲救濟之道，一方面固應政府力加保護，一方面仍須廠商精誠圑結，始能挽狂瀾於未到；救濟之法，約可分下列數　：</p>
<p>（一）　行傾銷稅　國家爲保護產業起見，對於外商火柴，皆應課以嚴重之稅率，對於外商在華設廠製造者，其所出之各種火柴，槪須實行登記；如商標·品質·售價等，都應詳細叙明，凡外商火柴售價低廉在其成本之下者，須特别抽以傾銷稅，以寓保護本國火柴之意，凡不來登而擅自發售，得隨時通令全國，禁止發售。</p>
<p>（二）限制洋商設廠　洋商在華設廠製造火柴，大槪有三種和益：（甲）可僱用廉價之華工，（乙）可利用中國廉價原料，（丙）一經製成，即可就地銷售，免負高度之關稅　運輸水脚等費；所以出品都價廉物美，與我國火柴廠勎不兩立，故亟應嚴加限制。但查外商火柴廠之設立，都根據昔時所訂通商條約，且設廠所在，多爲我國政令不行之租界，故此點實行，殊多困難。但如火柴廠之設立，應至吾國政府註册等等，必須頒布辦法實行，若經嚴格審查，因有種種關係，吾國政府應不予通過，禁止設立。</p>
<p>（三）减輕原料進口稅　我國火柴業雖時在風雨飄搖之中，但近年亦有長足之進展，如在上海浦東有國產華昌火柴梗片廠的設立等，故大部火柴原料，已能自給，無須仰給外國。火柴原料中有赤燐·綠酸鉀·硫黄·白臘油·等數種，國内尚無製造，故此種必須原料之進口，政府應審察情形，核輕稅率，並取消種種手續費，以便减輕成本，　推廣銷路，與外商火柴爭一日之長。</p>
<p>（四）推廣市塲　據專家估計，我國火柴現年可產百萬箱，但國内消費額尚不過六十萬箱有餘，不及七十萬箱，以致造成過剩局面，前已言之。是故欲謀產銷平均，供求相符，必須推廣銷路，發　國外市塲，最近之地當爲南洋羣島，查南洋羣島實爲瑞典火柴尾閭之地，即風行於我國之外商火柴，亦以瑞典火柴爲大宗，故瑞典火柴於火柴業中隱然有王者之位，今欲與此强有力之霸主角逐，非改良品質，抑低售價不可，否則恐不爲功也。</p>
<p>（五）改良品質　改進火柴之本質，實爲火柴業當今之要圖，查我國火柴昔時曾一度銷行於菲律濱之馬尼剌，率以（甲）擦一火柴全盒火柴易起燃着，（乙）發火不易，（丙）火柴之製造欠美，火柴梗容易折斷，火柴上藥不整齊，及其他理由而未爲彼邦人士歡迎，近聞大中華火柴公司之出品銷行於南洋一帶，前途頗爲樂觀，良以該廠出品，柴梗潔白，排列整齊，及發火容易而有以致之，深望吾國其他火柴廠家，亦大加改良，藉以推廣銷路。</p>
<p>（六）合併小廠　我國火柴現雖有百餘家，但考其資本能在五十萬上者，寥寥無幾，一百萬上者，尤屬少見，小廠家管理旣欠周密，成本又殊浩大，故欲謀大規模之生產，必須有大規模之火柴廠，資本雄厚，出品精良，管理方面旣减少麻煩，成本方面又較小廠各自爲政者爲省，故國内資本薄弱的火柴廠，亟自合併。</p>
<p>拉雜陳之，約可得上列數端，其他如應大加宜傳，勸導民衆服用國貨等，亦不失爲救濟之一法，總之，當此之時，時機緊迫，再不加以救濟，則我國火柴業勢將末路途窮，一敗塗地，而救濟之是否能够有效，全視政府能否爲本國工業打開一條出路，與火柴商人之能否精神圑結，和衷共濟爲轉移耳！</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>司法院副院長覃振氏赴歐考察各國之司法制度，於日前回國之時，曾提出改進中國司法制度意見書於政府，其所建議，共有九項，皆切中時要之言，而試辦陪審制度其一也。</p>
<p>覃氏之言曰：［陪審制度，發源於英，而推行於歐美各國。其職務，一方輔佐法院調查事宜，减少法官之勞力，他方預防法官之越權，濫押無辜，以保人民之自由······］</p>
<p>吾人細閱上項文字，陪審制度之重要，不言可見。陪審者責任，可以二點歸納之：（一）輔佐法院調查事宜，（二）預防法官之越權，旨哉言乎！可謂字字中肯矣。鄙人在醫言醫，請看醫案必須實行陪審制度之理由。</p>
<p>近來醫病糾紛，日甚一日，有風起雲湧，不可遏止之勢。受理之法院，被控之醫家，以醫學爲至專門之學術，非普通法律條文所能判斷無餘，於是往往以該案之經過情形要求國内之正式醫學機關作學理上之鑑定。此種鑑定之工作，與覃氏所說［輔助法院之調查，减少法官之勞力之宗旨，若合符節，此固陪審制度之初步階梯也。惟此種鑑定之文字，僅爲書面之根據，法官於判决時，是否卽以此項文字爲根據，殊未可必。不幸而法官仍出以武斷之態度時，則此種鑑定之工作，不亦等於虚勞，而醫界之寃獄，不亦終難消滅乎？須知法官判斷一案，根據訴狀之理由者十分之三四，根據當庭之辯論者十九之六七，苟其訴狀之理由雖充，而當庭辯論時限於口才，或法官所問未能得其要點，則仍難免於敗訴。職是之故，此專門家之陪審所以至關重要也。吾人爲維護公理，平反寃獄起見，於正式醫學機關文字之鑑定外，當再進一步要求陪審，陪審者之資格，應爲深通醫學而又兼明法律之學者，一面可以輔助法官審問時之不到，一面可糾正法官之輕表同情於任何一方，如此則庶幾可達覃氏所說之［預防法官越權，而保人民自同之目的。用敢略書所見，以備司法行政者之採擇焉！</p>
<h3 id="c184">淮陰衛生醫藥狀况談（下） <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 徐放游</p>
<p>（五）舊醫業　舊醫在現今社會中。仍占優勝勢力。淮陰除鄕區不計外。卽城廂内外。約有舊醫六七十人。在民初有淮陰醫學研究會之組織。會員約三十餘人。至民十三。改組爲淮陰醫藥研究會。會員之數亦如之。近因受省府頒發管理中醫規則之剌激。遂向黨部呈請組織淮陰國醫公會。極積進行。業於本月二十三日正式成立。會員約六十人。</p>
<p>舊醫自民國以來。無官醫局之設立。在民初曾由地方人士。集欵逢夏季在城外慈雲寺施醫施藥。後以無欵停辦。近年則每逢夏季。由清江濟生分會。延醫施診給藥。爲期三個月云。</p>
<p>（六）舊藥業　舊藥之在今日。一方面固將不免自行淘汰。然一方面亦有值得提但改良者。淮陰城廂内外。約舊藥店約二十家之譜。率皆故步自封。卽照方如法泡製。恐亦未必能個個遵行。長此以往。退化堪虞。足在業此者之自覺如何耳。</p>
<p>舊藥圑體。有淮陰藥業公會。係與新藥業合併。爲商會同業公會會員之一。但近聞有將與新成立之國醫公會合併之說。未知果否實現也。</p>
<p>（七）新興之醫療機關　一、黑熱病研究隊。黑熱病（Ｋａｌａｆ·Ａｇａｒ）俗名痞塊病。近來在蘇北一帶。蔓延甚廣。如淮陰，漣水，泗陽，灌雲，東海，宿遷，銅山等縣。猖獗流行。自今年春初。由衛生署特派科長姚永政，衛生實騐處技正黄克綱，專員曾任德國漢堡大學敎授德人華克爾博士（Ｖｏｇｅｌ）等。前來蘇北各縣實地調查。於一月十三日抵淮陰。隨赴淮，海，徐屬各縣。兼往安徽之懷遠，鳳陽等縣。調查一週。返京復命。經衛生署與衛生實騐處商决。定於淮陰設立一防治黑熱病之機關。一面治療現有病人。一面從事學理之探討。一俟傳染途徑判明。再擬推廣防治工作區域。意至善也。遂於五月間。由衛署派姚永政科長。及蒲南谷博士二人來淮陰勘定地址。籌備一切。卽於六月二十日。正式宣告成立。該隊係設在前民衆醫院舊圵。正門開於省立民敎館内。佔屋二十餘間。現由蒲南谷，孫志戎，兩醫博士爲正副主任。主持醫務。另有助手，護士，職員，公役等。共約十餘人。内設診察，手術，調藥檢騐，動物，冷藏等室。該隊因重在研究。附帶治療。故住院病牀。祗備六張。一切免費。分文不取。門診隔日一次。每次限定六號。至多爲十號。亦完全免費。據聞自成立至今四個月中。已治愈約五百餘人。甚望該隊此後更能努力工作。擴大範圍。使黑熱病傳染之途徑。早日研究判明。俾得預防有術。一面請各方恊助欵項。於蘇北流行區域。多設免費治療機關。功莫大焉。</p>
<p>二、縣立戒烟所　該所於本月初開始籌備。由省禁烟會令委徐先靑爲所長。所址設於中國紅十字會清江浦分會内。内分診察，調藥，養病，調騐等室。一切尚在佈置中。</p>
<p>（八）結論　上述係淮陽最近之衛生醫藥狀况。無進步之可言。好在現今蘇省主政得人。對於衛生事項。頗爲重視。想不久的將來。必能於各地衛生行政，及送醫藥事業，有整個的規畫。藉謀推進。而吾淮陰民衆。亦可以連帶的享受政府推行公共衛生之利益。不禁跂予望之。</p>

<p>— 陳保勤</p>
<p>重男輕女，爲中國數千年之積習，亦帝制國家常有之現象，因政權旣握於一人之手，則其一切之規定，當然以稱個人之私慾爲目的，視女子如玩物，如貨品，剝奪其入權殆盡，法律更訂有處罰女子之專　　　　　　，施此爲極。幸目鼎　以來，在總理引導之下，女子始得見恢復自由之一線曙光，男女平等之說，載諸遺敎，方期在今日革命行將完成之際，權利義務，男女共同負國家之責任，不料此次改訂立法，乃竟有出人意料外者。</p>
<p>自立法院修正刑法草案，通過第二二一條第二項「姦淫未滿十四歲之女子以强姦論］及二三九條［有夫之婦與人通姦者處一年以下有期徒刑、其相姦者亦同］後，一般專事玩弄女姓之徒，當如何欣喜雀躍，狂呼立法委員萬歲！男權萬歲，以爲可能從此放浪形骸，秦樓楚館，任所欲爲。苟其妻少加規勸，則可勵聲變色而言曰［此乃國法特許之權利，何得妄加干涉乎？］</p>
<p>在表面觀之，果然勝利屬於男性，而實際上乃引導一般男性走向萬惡之途，是不啻國家立法，獎勵人民之自投法網而自傷其身也。</p>
<p>人固知雅片之足以亡國滅種，違犯者均爲法定之罪人，故今日之獄中囚犯以犯鴉片之法者爲數最多，是立法者，並未因犯法者多，而拆除也。何以謂處罰［有婦之夫］則觸犯者必多，爲避免監獄有人滿之患起見，遂因噎廢食，根本取消，是曰可，孰不可？今日之監獄，幾盡爲烟犯所據：後至者將無揷足餘地，是烟禁亦可廢弛矣。</p>
<p>减低女子强姦年齡，固屬催殘女性。蓋女女成熟，以月經來潮爲標準。中國土地之廣，因氣候關係，十四歲之女子，已見月經者，爲數甚少，豈能以少數代表多數乎？女子遇此不幸者，以百分爲比例，究屬爲數甚少，而男子之因與人通姦，傳染花柳病者，比比皆是，其影響個人之健康，與民族之健全，至大且鉅。</p>
<p>本人業醫，故知之較詳。平日應診，旣標明爲女醫師，更未書花柳專科，但據臨診上之統計，男女病人中之患花柳病者，占全數百分之六十以上，在中國之習慣，女子患病就診於女醫師，固理所當然，今男子患花柳病，而求治於予，在無醫學知識者觀之亦可稱奇矣。則彼輩男醫師之專治花柳者，更當門庭若市，又南京市衛生事務所之疾病統計表，亦以花柳病占最高率。由此可見花柳病散佈之廣，可謂已深入民間，其何由而染此，何需贅言。此固個人之道德缺乏修養，亦國家法律之不加干預所致。</p>
<p>觀夫每一患者之來，憂戚其面。蹣跚其行，羞愧懊傷，言語懾懦，其内心之隱痛，懺悔之無及，可以想見矣。揭視其患處或尿道口膿流成小渠，包皮腫脹潰爛小便如剌如焚。鮮血並下。或小便頻數，日數十次，不解自出。或閉塞不通，膀胱澎漲，點滴難下。或睪丸腫大疼痛難忍。丨愈後每不能生育子女。更有膝節腫脹不能行走者。凡此乃［白濁］之大槪也。至於［梅毒］則初期生殖器部，生瘡或潰爛。第二期週身發斑疹，頭痛骨酸，體温增高，食慾不振。第三期則深入骨髓或穿通頭頂鼻骨，擴大潰爛，奇臭難聞，俗所謂開天窗。或侵入脊髓，而腿脚不能行動，成爲癱廢。或入内臓而成腫瘤。或腐蝕血管壁，而成動脤瘤，一旦破裂，死於俄傾；更有需將肢體鋸去者。或血管硬化，易成中風。或心瓣腐蝕，成爲閉鎖不全等症。許多内外科病症之起因於梅毒者，更非常人所夢想得到也。再則爲［軟性下疳］除生殖器，局部有小潰瘍外，同時並發鼠蹊部淋巴綫腫脹，所謂横痃：此時體發寒熱，疼痛萬狀，步行維艱，及其成熟潰爛，更非一朝一夕所可醫治而愈者。上述本病之症狀及其經過與並發症種種，自有專書誌其詳，今不過言</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>其大槪之大槪，而使一般人士略有所知，而知所警惕耳，因患者每於得病後苦痛難當之際，輙痛哭流涕，泣蒼天而呼父母，亦已晚矣！此時法律能爲之保障乎？病菌能知其爲男性而不加侵害乎？</p>
<p>更不幸傳染其妻，則其妻除無辜而受此痛苦外。更影響子嗣焉。女子染得［白濁］後，除尿道外，陰道爲其重要之殖民地，此時若生產子女，則其經過產道時，雙目能受淋菌之傳染而成盲。由陰道上升而達子宮成白濁性子宮炎，痛苦固不待言。旣成慢性炎症之後，雖能受孕，多易於二三月時流產。更上升而成白濁性喇叭管炎，則又爲僅產二子或流產後不妊之主因。梅毒患者所產之嬰兒多夭逝，或於懷孕七八月後卽胎死腹中。</p>
<p>前述種種皆於種族之健康民族之生存，有莫大之關係故有配偶而與人通姦者，其爲害更甚，豈但個人之戕賊身心，耗費金錢，損失名譽，影響職業，破壞家庭幸福，爲社會所唾棄而已也。</p>
<p>再有爲日常臨診所常遇者，卽病者要求醫師爲其施行人工墮胎，此固爲正式醫師所拒，而一般江湖之士及無知穩婆，則惟利是圖，施以不合科學之方法，而女子之死於非命者，亦報章日有所載。其他因姦淫而發生之慘案。更不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>今一部份男性立委，以爲祗處罰女性，爲擁護男權，造福男性；殊不知乃自設陷阱，以陷之，且以陷中國之全民族也。苟立法規定有配偶而與人通姦者均處以徒刑，則一般男性雖不因畏罪而避免，亦將爲免除去婦對簿公庭，而有所戒，於是花柳病之傳播無形中爲之大减種族之健全可期。抑何一部份立委之無醫學常識而缺乏社會眼光至於斯也。</p>

<p>（二十六）實扶的里（續稱白喉）續</p>
<p>論到咽頭實扶的里的併發症，可以區别爲傳播性和轉移性炎症的兩種，現在大略講一講，如左。</p>
<p>（甲）傳播性炎症，主要的炎症，有三，如左。</p>
<p>（一）鼻腔實扶的里　大都先來鼻腔的充塞和旺盛的分泌物，初爲槳液性，後爲血様膿性（診斷鼻腔實扶的里最重要的一點）。上唇的皮膚，因鼻腔流出分泌物的剌戟，以致潮紅腫脹，時常有一種壞疽性的斷片，從發炎的鼻粘膜脫離，而排出於外方，若用鼻鏡來檢查鼻腔，則見灰白綫色的壞疽性組織，患鼻腔實扶的里的時候，千萬不可輕視，因爲狠多的小兒，常可由全身敗血症或衰脫而死亡。</p>
<p>（二）喉頭實扶的里　是從咽頭實扶的里傳播於喉頭所發的一種重篤的併發症，小兒最多，他的危險，就是在發生急性喉頭狹窄的症候，如果治療不當，或治療過遲，則多因窒息而死亡</p>
<p>（三）中耳炎　炎症波及中耳的時候，那就患者耳内感覺到劇痛，終至化膿，變成鼓膜穿孔，甚至誘起種種的症候或危險。</p>
<p>（乙）轉移性炎症　屬於這一類的炎症，都是因爲實扶的里毒素的作用，他主要的炎症，有五，如左。</p>
<p>一，急性腎臟炎丨最多。</p>
<p>二，心臟亦常發障碍，有時且來突然的心臟死。</p>
<p>三，肺丨往往發生肺炎的症候。</p>
<p>四，多發性關節炎丨在關節誘起疼痛性的腫脹。</p>
<p>五，皮膚的變化丨如薔薇疹様或紅斑様的發疹，或來皮膚出血。（未完）</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>帮助内部排洩</p>
<p>前已講過發熱時須帮助皮膚排洩。除了帮助皮膚排洩以外帮助兩腎排洩是最要緊的。發熱時很多的藥品是不必用的。至於利小便的藥品是例外的。小便出的多，雖不能盡排去細菌生出的毒質，但也可以帮助排洩出去一部分。我們也曉得發熱的病人若小便量少時，尿就很濃厚，比重也高。濃厚的尿與腎有害。所以帮助腎多排洩，尿成淡薄，比重减低，這様腎不會受傷，將來也不會生腎炎。帮助腎排洩藥品雖不少，但對於發熱病人最適宜的是檸酸鈉。這種藥一助腎排洩，二利痰，三利大便，四加增身内齡質（ＡｌｋａｌｉＲｅｓｅｌｌｖｅ）。我們曉得發熱時身内常是多酸質。故加增齡質就可中和酸質，使酸質在身内不爲害。身體血液保守中和性與身體有很大益處。這種藥服了也不阻礙消化。不過這種藥有時呌人作恶心。故服時一匙藥水和水或水菓汁一杯服下爲宜。水菓汁類以檸檬水，橘子水，葡萄汁爲佳。</p>
<p>藥物與治療發熱</p>
<p>减除痛苦　平常所用的退熱藥品實際上是發熱的麻醉品。水療退熱與藥品退熱根本不相同。水療退熱同時並不减少身體生活的能力與身體的抵抗力。至於藥品退熱則不然，因藥品一方面退熱，一方面也减低身體生活力故亦减低抵抗力。所以熱特别高時光要退熱就不應當服退熱藥。這些藥品最大的功用是止頭痛，去全身痛，鎭靜神經，帮助睡眠。注意這些藥品不可服太多。如果太多了，一减少抵抗力，二呌病人出汗過多或使身體虚脫。所以用這些藥品的最大目的是减少病人的疼痛。還有一件須注意的卽病人的疼痛常是在病的起頭，故疼痛一停止了，退熱藥品就不可再服。</p>
<p>這一類藥品名不勝載，市上銷售的不止千百種。注目廣告到處皆是。市上行銷的外貨極多，本國製造的也更是不少。病家也眞不暇來問一問到底這一種是什麽藥料製成的，並且到底有什麽功效。茲略述數種發熱常用的藥品以供讀者研究。</p>
<p>（一）金鷄納類　現在大多數人都知道外兼可退熱。其退熱的原因是减低身體生活的能力。由生活能力之减低，熱度也因而降低。這種藥也可以减少疼痛，鎭靜神經，所以服少許金鷄納有時很可以帮助發熱病人睡眠。由此可見發熱病人沒有特别疼痛，神經穩定並用不到這種藥品。再者此藥旣然减少身體抵抗病菌的能力故不宜多服。</p>
<p>（二）柳酸鈉，醋柳酸等，這些藥物對於减除筋骨痛，骨節痛，頭痛等有相當的功效，但亦不可長時期服用，或服過量。</p>
<p>（三）安替派林類　這一類藥品都是由石炭脂内分析或合成的。其餘最主要的爲退熱冰片，斐那昔汀，安密都派林，疋拉密洞等。這一類藥品市上變像的製品極多。少服固稍有益於止痛，但萬不可多服。現在已證明多服這一類藥是有害的。生病發熱頭痛時固然要减低發熱减去頭痛。但不要忘記最大的目的是要身體快恢復健康。假設爲减少少許疼痛使身體紙抗力减低致使病勢危險加重，是萬不可行的。止痛藥作用幾盡是麻醉神經，實際痛仍在身上，不過自己不覺到我是了。那麽，若少微忍受些疼痛使病快能安然全愈還算好些。</p>
<p>急救昏絶</p>
<p>每一位發熱很高的病人都有昏絶的機會。看護他的見他病勢沉重不應當單單爲他掉眼淚，應當想法帮助他度過危險。要帮助他必須知道他的病狀與他的需要。病人第一危機就是血流停滞。血流一方面運輸滋養科到全身各部分，各細胞，一方面也由這些部分帶廢科到排洩器官使排洩出去。就好像，上海市一切交通運輸都停滞了當然是不得了。所以血流一停滞，一位病人就算是走近陰間的大門。血流停滞是由於細菌所生之毒質使身體的細胞失落機能。看護病人的須知如何認出危機認識危機的現象，就好想法預防與施行急救。</p>
<p>血流停滞的程度低病人就發生昏絶。血流停滞的程度高病人就要死亡。血流停滞第一是由於血管失落功用，第二是由於心臟衰竭失落功用。有的病如喉痧特别容易使心臟停止功用致使病人昏絶。普通由血管失落功用昏絶的，先是腹内部血管失落收縮性，故血聚在内臟，皮膚因缺少血而成灰白色，發冷，心跳加快。末後血停滞加甚嘴唇手脚指便發紫，最後脈搏不規則，病勢達到千鈞一髮的時機。</p>
<p>施行相當治療即（一）口服或注射强心劑，以病勢爲斷。（二）如血管失落收縮性，將病床脚頭墊高或降低使血流到下肢，或血流回上部。外摩擦下肢，摩擦方向推血向脚。腹部用布條綁緊使血少停留在腹部内臟。心臟如失去效能除給强心劑外扶病人坐起。這些方法如施行得當很有起死回生的效力。</p>
<p>恢復期間的療養</p>
<p>病人熱度一停止了，不能算治療告終了。還有一部分的治療也是很要緊的。這一部分的治療就是快使病人復原，快使他回復原來的工作。在這個過程當中治療得當，全愈就要快，治療不得當，復原不但不能快，有時還有别種疾病乘機發生。已弱的身軀如再遭到厲害的病魔的蹂躪自必凶多吉少。故漸恢復時也必須用正當的治療法。第一件須注意的卽病人漸全愈時他常自己覺得强壯過於實際的强壯，卽［心有餘而力不足］。他自己覺得自己已經强壯了，其實他還沒有那様强壯。所以不可照着病人的心意使他過快起來。有一個普通的定律當遵守，卽發熱後靜臥（或靜養）的日子應當等於發熱的日子之多少。例如發熱三天，發熱停後還要靜臥三天。發熱有一個月，發熱後也要靜養一個月。易變成慢性病或易引起别種病症的發熱病，病漸愈時須特别延長靜養時期。例如急性風濕痛病或急性腎炎，發熱停後須靜養數星期之久。急性心臟炎或勞病停止發熱後須靜養數月之久。復原期間易引起别種危險病症的病如，喉痧與由猩紅熱生的腎炎症，就是病初愈後，看見與健康人無異，還必須靜養幾個星期。爲什麽呢？喉痧後因患喉痧時，喉痧的毒損壞了心臟，病愈後急起來動作很容易使心臟衰竭，立卽喪失生命。患猩紅熱後引起的腎炎症，如一不愼腎炎厲害極不易挽救。</p>
<p>假設每日量病人温度若還有少許熱度，還要特别注意他，不可以爲他是完全全愈了。少許熱度顯明身内還有發炎點，或者是身内又引起了别種毛病。有了這種情形應當請醫師仔細查騐明白。有時候病後大便閉結也可使身體少發熱，大便通了發熱就停止了。有時少發熱是由病後停止靜養太早。如果再延長了靜養，身體就可以快快完全復原。</p>
<h3 id="c189">肺結核淺說（三十一） <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>痰的檢查是怎様的情形呢？照診斷學上所講，係有肉眼，鏡騐，細菌學，和化學檢查，四種分類的。内中化學檢查一門，在臨床上的關係比較狠小，像最重要的蛋白質之證明，已沒有多大的價值了。在肺結核症方面，除去纖维性的型式一種時有變態外，另外的幾種，痰裏面都含着蛋白質的。這當然對於本病的診斷上，係沒有多大的關係了。所以我們此處的分類是：Ａ肉眼的檢查，Ｂ顯微鏡的檢查，Ｃ結核菌的檢查，關於這方面詳細情形，現在且一一的叙述在下面；</p>
<p>Ａ肉眼的檢查　我們要曉得，肺結核病人的痰，在肉眼方面並沒有特殊的認識一望而卽可加以肯定的；祗能由此揣測而作進一步的研究方行的。在此處應該辯别的，有粘液性，粘液透明性，粘液化膿性，純膿性，膿球狀等幾種。的痰，大槪都散漫於水底的。肺結核病人的痰大半是屬諸粘液性和粘液透明性，爲量並不狠多；如果是發生空洞了，他的痰大槪是粘液化膿性。這粘液和膿，融合並不怎様周密，和氣管枝炎氣管枝擴張症的痰不同。粘液作透明狀，膿作黄色或黄綠色，所以在肉眼方面，是不難分别的。這種膿在粘液裏面，有時是小塊散在狀，或且成較大的圑塊，結果成爲線條狀球狀貨幣狀種種不同的狀態，這就是球狀痰錢狀痰得名之原始了！此外，像痰中發現血絲；以及住居都市者，因吸入炭煤的關係，痰中時現黑絲，甚至全體都變成暗灰色了丨這種種也祗須用肉眼觀察，就可水落石出的；他們雖不是本病的特徵，但間接的關係也是免不了的。</p>
<p>Ｂ顯微鏡的檢查　關係本症在顯微鏡下的工作，當然是以結核菌的有無爲最重要而帶專門性了！他是需要一種染色手續方可見着的，這都另詳在下面一段裏面。至於不染色標本一方面呢？在顯微鏡下的發現也是狠多的。此中和本症關係最大的，自莫過於［彈力纖維］的發現了丨他在痰裏面，有時是獨立的，或結合成束狀和綱狀的；他的形態，也有直條和屈曲種種不同的分别；成綱狀的一種，他的枝末分岐，和肺組織是狠類似的。他的發生原因，大半是肺組織已破壞的證據，狠少由於氣管枝壁的。他在痰内的發現，雖沒有像結核菌的發現在診斷上那様堅决可靠，但關係究竟是狠大的。尋常患有肺結核症嫌疑者，有時胸部的診查，所得並不狠多；，但如果痰中發現彈力纖維了，這種存疑不决的念頭，馬上就會轉變的，我們到少也可以說：關於肺結核症的診斷，大致總不會相差太遠了。</p>
<p>除開彈力纖維外，在顯微鏡下可見着的，還有粘液絲和粘液球，肺胞上皮，赤血球，白血球，澱粉様體等種種；這都是和肺結核症直接間接多少有一點關係的。</p>
<p>患有肺結核症嫌疑的人們，在檢痰的時候，有一事决不可忘郤者，卽肺二口虫卵之有無是已，這一種寄生虫病，幾乎是東亞獨有的，人體肺部經其寄生後，卽發種種病變；他的症象，和肺結核症是差相彷佛的。在開始的時期，悲者現輕度咳嗽，時吐濃厚粘痰，痰中現鮮紅　赤的班點，這和肺結核病人痰中發現血絲的情形，差不多是沒有什麽分别的。到了日子一久，咳嗽加劇，甚至發生多量喀血，并發現貧血和呼吸促迫的症象，結果發生須經過完密的騐痰手見的。這兩方面（肺結核和肺二口虫病）的眞正認識，完全須經過完密的騐痰手續方行的；這一點手續，看似平淡無奇，其實關係於雙方　非淺鮮的，就是今後的治療方針，也是完全兩様的。希望讀者們和病家勿等問視纔好！</p>

<p>破除迷信這一個任務，我們也做得够了。</p>
<p>在從前，我們曾經用過通俗的講演，站在自然科學的立塲上去破除，但結果是毫無成績。</p>
<p>就是到現在，也還有不少的有心人，他們也還在這様地做。比方，月蝕罷，他們老早就把這一件事在報紙上預告出來，說某日某時甚至某分，在什麽地方一定看得見月蝕；或是用極通俗的文字，把月蝕的道理，在刋物上發表出來，希望大衆們一個個都能瞭解。但是，一到了月蝕的時候，一般的大衆，他們仍舊還是要敲他們的鑼，放他們的爆；他們要努力去救他們寳貴的月光。</p>
<p>用自然科學去破除迷信，不僅只在這様一些地方失敗。最大的失敗，郤還在：那些自然科學的研究者，同時他們自己有許多郤又是迷信者。比方，今日紅十字會的醫師，有幾位不信奉宗敎呢？</p>
<p>這就因爲；在最早，人們的迷信，固然是起於對於自然的不能駕馭和瞭解；但是，那還是社會依存於自然的時候。到後來，科學的知識進步了，人們能够用着自然科學和技術去支配自然了；這對於一般具有知識的人們，對於自然界的迷信，那自然是减少了。但是，從新又來了一個不能瞭解不能支配的東西；丨丨這東西就是我們住在裏面的社會。社會的經濟恐慌，以及可怕的戰爭和革命，都成爲想避免而不能避免的東西。在這裏，近代迷信的根源又隱藏着了。　就是掉換一個方法，站在社會科學的立塲上的破除迷信，那也不是一種皮相的行動所能做到。比方，在湖南，我們曾經看見成千成萬的農民一鼓作氣地把一切廟宇以至學宮搗毁。</p>
<p>但是，到現在，新起的廟宇，比從前更加闊氣了。又比方，在廣西，當國民革命軍通過的時候，由軍事領袖的指揮，把一切的廟字打得一個乾凈。但是，到現在，在那些沒有了泥菩薩的破廟旁邊，那些求豐年的農民以及求藥方的病者還是經常地在那裏［如在其上，如在其左右］地祈求跪拜。</p>
<p>［迷信］到了近代，完全變成了一個社會上的問題，而不是一個自然上的問題。是人們和人們關係上發生出來的問題，而不是人們和自然關係上發生出來的問題。在早幾年，我的祖父死了，我想不做道塲，不燒紙屋，不看風水，不擇日期，但是，我的親戚乃至近鄰都來干涉我。他們說：［你不信，我們要信；你的祖父的死後不安，同時就要影響到我們都不安的。］在這一件事的過程上，我對於自然上的迷信是已經打破了；但是，因爲社會的關係，卽是我和親戚近鄰的關係，結果是我被屈服了。</p>
<p>就是單就勸人破除迷信這一點說，這已經是一件社會的任務了。人家要迷信，讓人家自己去迷信好了，爲什麽我們要去勸他們破除呢？這理由也就是：因爲我們和他們生存在一個社會上有一個關聯的緣故。</p>
<p>對於迷信，我們最要緊的是要去看出牠物質的根源。在歷史上，我們看得出；有一種息様的社會，便有一種怎様的迷信或宗敎和牠相應。在中國，我們現在也可以看得出；在農村，一般人主要的希望是從土地裏面多收一點穀子；因此，農村中最基本最普遍的神也就呌做［土地］。在城市，一般人的希望是安居，是樂業，他們便用那種用泥土砌築成功的城隍（或城池）做他們安居樂業的保障；因此，城市中最主要的最普遍的神也就呌做［城隍］。用泥土砌築的城隍，現在雖然有的被拆去了，但是一般市民對於安居樂業的希望，還不曾得到一個確切的保障；因此，［城隍］這一位菩薩，還能够普遍地存在。大衆現在對於［城隍］的希望，也還是希望他能够［保障一方］。</p>
<p>總之，迷信這件東西，牠也是一種世界觀：牠和任何種的宗敎乃至任何種的哲學都有一部份相同的性質：丨丨那就是在某一個時間某一個空間裏面對於世界的解釋。不過，迷信這件東西，牠不過僅只是一種最原始的最基本的一種對於世界的解釋罷了。</p>
<p>我們目前，在中國，如果想要擔負起這一個破除迷信的任務；或者說，想要把一種停滞在迷信上的世界觀，推進到現代的世界觀，那還是只有從社會的物質的根源上做起。</p>
<p>每一次迷信的表現，都是一個矛盾的表現：那就是一方面表現着對於精神的信仰，一方面郤又表現着對於物質的要求。我們如果要破除那一種精神信仰上的迷信，那除非是從物質上能够滿足他們的要求。誰能够滿足農民對於收穫上的要求，便是誰能够消滅農民的迷信中的［收穫］；誰能够在物質上滿足了市民們安居樂業的保障，便是誰能够在根本上消滅了城市中的迷信。</p>

<p>秋，一到鳥蘭呼都克，天氣就冷起來。平原攤着黄金的顏色，枯萎的荒草乾黄乾黄的貼地躺着。西北風震天價沒死沒活的刮，黑夜白天不住氣兒，越刮越兇。人哪牲口哪，被冷風侵襲着，四肢都有點發抖，伸展的靈活，自由，完全給暴風剝奪了去。一切都是呆板的，蠢笨的，彷佛這風是特意來刨治烏蘭呼都克平原。</p>

<p>塔什嫩河的汩汩流水聲，早已聽不見了，誰都知道那聲音是被薄薄地毛冰掩藏住了。</p>
<p>風一天比一天厲害，寒冷在烏蘭呼都克平原上燃燒，急激的燃燒着，眼看就要下雪。游牧在烏蘭呼都克平原上的人們，爲了牲畜的安全，不得不去尋找［背風向陽］的地方住。　　　烏蘭呼都克平原，前沒山後沒嶺，海底拉拉漠的風襲過來，沒遮攔的一直冲到這兒。這個誰都明白，要是冬季天也住在這里，牲口一定會被暴風捲走，說不定羊羣和帳幕也會在風吼中失踪。</p>

<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>浮在海上像一個小鳥似的航海郵船將要啟駛了。警告似的呌着，剌激着行人的耳鼓。天空瀰漫着大霧，白茫茫的顏色籠罩着天，水，地。碼頭上擁擠着性别不同的人羣，撲面送來的是海風，打在臉上像一塊浸在機汽油裏並且塗滿了煤灰的海綿體。</p>
<p>我同約翰在舢板上，對面望不清眉眼，我們都在警戒着扒手，經騐告訴我們是，留神在擁擠中的每秒鐘。東西失掉還是小事，說不定，肉體也許被推落在天水不分的深海中，像一顆穀粒沉到池塘中似的，消失了。我們遙望着那浮島似的航船上，透過濃霧有很輝煌的燈火。</p>
<p>大家都想不到話題，大家的心裏都是像濃霧一般的空虚與渺茫。在血肉的環境中造成的感情，這時候，是電似的蔓延在將要離别的人羣裏。我聽到身邊有人在熱烈的接吻，嗚咽着一些動心的短句；我聞到一個人的衣服上滿是機器油氣味觸鼻，又看看約翰，他正在背轉身來依戀地向岸上痴望呢。</p>
<p>［先生，要土嗎？］我忽然感到一隻手扯了一下我的衣襟。立刻，我就打落他的手，心裏想怎麽這類地方還有經營私貨的。</p>
<p>［先生，］同一的聲音繼續着說［這是家鄕土，家鄕土，萬一有了水土不服，冲了家鄕土······］</p>
<p>我看不清對面是怎麽一個人，只見一隻手送過來一個紙包，一個手指上有一顆亮晶晶的鑽石在發光。</p>
<p>［若是别離了祖國，家鄕土是更有用的。］</p>
<p>這商人的談吐頗不俗，我方纔要伸過手去，但有一隻手抓過那紙包，不用說，那手是約翰的。我很驚訝他平日是那麽一個剛强的人，可是當他要踏到别一種岩石構造的土層之前，他不禁對於鄕土起了依戀。</p>
<p>［幾多錢？］約翰問。</p>
<p>［隨便的，］那人說。</p>
<p>［我賣這土將有二十年，從前没有爲錢起什麽争端！］·········</p>
<p>我看到那隻手又送到來一個紙包，一個手指上有一顆亮晶晶的鑽石在發光，這個亮晶晶的東西，莫非是二十年來的代價嗎？約翰從口袋裏信手掏出一個整數的錢幣，交易了兩袋薄薄的白紙包。那有鑽石的手，便消失了。　　　　［投機呵！］我低聲嘆息。</p>
<p>［不，］對方投來反對的意見，［這土是有用的。當我小的時候，到縣裏進學堂，母親當我每次回來總是把一包土給我，愛撫地說，［病了加上白糖冲水喝！］有一年病倒在省城裏，爸爸特意携了一個土來看我，而今呢，媽媽如果還活着，他是不會忘掉替我預備的，媽媽是沒有了，我是不會忘掉···········］</p>
<p>他輕輕地說着，汨汨如細泉長流。我只好傾聽着。</p>
<p>濃霧仍未消失，天水依然在渺茫裏接聯。我們一同上了大船，燈光底下，我看到這年靑人的眼皮却有點紅潤呢。因爲霧太厚，船似乎暫時並不開駛，我們看見到處都滾着離别的情緒，電感似的，會心的微痛，我們便更沉默了。</p>
<p>看到這情形，我不由得想到丨丨丨</p>
<p>這是有形無形的鄕土熱呀，我們的僑民，無論到了什麽地方，都是在罣記着他們的鄕土的！特别是這時候，這時候，人們更會記憶鄕土</p>

<p>她默默地順從着他，在木栅旁邊耐心地聽着；眼睛注射下面，做着編織絨綫的工作。紅　很遲慢地出現於她的不大整理而豐盛的紅色的髮下面的灰白的皮膚上。她的父親的髮是顯明的紅色的。</p>
<p>她有一個豐滿的身軀；一個疲乏憔悴的面孔。當海格波特船長誇示着家庭的必要與應該，以及火爐的快樂的時候，她只在她的嘴唇上，微微掛了一絲笑意。她的家庭的快樂在她的人生最好的十年中，只限於看護她的父親。</p>
<p>從樓上窗口來的粗鄙的喊聲常把他們的談話打斷。她立即把他的編織絨綫工作或縫袵工作舒徐地收拾起來。同時這種呼喚她的名字的怒嘷，繼續下去，會使遊蕩於路那邊海堤上的漁夫掉轉頭來向着這兩座小屋。她常慢慢地從前門走進去，過了一刻，一切都沉寂下去。不久之後，她又再出來，用手攙扶着一個粗鄙不可理喻壞脾氣憂鬱面色，像河馬様的人走出來。</p>

<p>— 皮</p>
<p>昨見報載，楊化昭在普陀落伽山出家，已有三年，劉玉春現亦在普陀九龍篷爲僧，惟楊劉二氏，雖在普陀出家，行蹤甚秘，故無人識彼爲戎馬餘生云。</p>
<p>楊化昭，是民十三齊盧戰爭時的一位名將。劉玉春，是民十五死守武昌，頑抗革命軍的一位健將。今楊在普陀落伽山出家，劉在普陀九龍篷爲僧，這兩位從前都是殺人不貶眼的魔君。現在均遁入空門，眞所謂［放下屠刀，立地成佛］，不能不說這兩位英雄的覺悟。</p>
<p>楊劉從前的功罪，現在且敝開不談，但到底這兩位都是能征慣戰的好漢，現在鐵血主義的世界，正須要這様一類的人材，去捍衛國家，發揚民氣，故普陀山中多兩個和尚，直接是個人的損失，間接是國家的損失。</p>
<p>和尚原是英雄的末路，英雄原是和尚的化身。有出路便做英雄，無出路便做和尚。就在歷史上看來，原是很平凡的一件事，做和尚原是消極生活的一種方式，但英雄如此，非英雄也是如此。現在社會中有形的和尚，雖還尚少，而無形的和尚，實在很多，因爲現在社會的心理，都是和尚的心理。</p>
<p>例如［自殺］是和尚的心理，［沉湎酒色］也是和尚的心理，辦事［存五日京兆之心］，是和尚的心理。［今朝有酒今朝醉］，也是和尚的心理，遇友必曰［近日怎様消遣？］是和尚的心理，［做人實在無聊得很］，也是和尚的心理。這種思想傳播開來，便成消極的社會，消極的國家，個人消極則個人無希望，社會消極則社會無希望，國家消極則國家無希望。</p>
<p>人民消極心理的養成，不外兩途：（一）被帝國主義者的侵略，一時無法翻身，（二）因社會經濟制度的不良毫無生路。所謂［今日不知明日事］，［不圖後世有人身］，如此心理的養成，實是社會墮落的根本原素，［哀莫大於心死］最是無法救藥的一件事。</p>
<p>我並不是爲楊劉做了和尚，替他可惜，而發出此種議論，實因楊劉做和尚，而感覺到現在社會的消極狀態，正和楊劉的消極觀念相同者甚多，不能不爲之寒心，明姚廣孝之姊語廣孝曰，［我不曾見做不了和尚的是個好人］則楊劉之能做和尚，還是好的，還有做不了和尚而還俗的朋友很多，比和尚還要不好呢。</p>

<p>冬，把高貴的小姐們從熱閙的朱雀路趕回寂寞的深閨裏去了。</p>
<p>賸下來的，只是些鳩形鵠面的丐者。飢寒交迫，把他們一批批跟着時間速度的增加，趕出了家，趕出了田園，流浪到街頭，流浪到首都來，僭纂了小姐們紅的綠的地位，點綴着朱雀路的凄凉。</p>
<p>朱雀路之冬，是一個被遺棄的情婦丨是一個第三期黴毒病的患者丨</p>

<p>飄楓零葉，斷梗殘枝，正是詩人們的大好詩料。而我們却只聽到斷續的寒蟄，在枯枝敗草間，慼慼地奏着秋之葬曲。</p>
<p>國民，首都，南京，·······這幾家電影院，却跟着冬之來臨，就特别生意興隆起來。太太小姐們，沒有生就熬冷的骨頭，不敢在西北風裏露面，終天鎖在深閨中，太無聊了，最適當的去處，上電影院去罷。那裏有熱水汀，暖洋洋的春天天氣，有彈簧座，嗑幾顆松子，談一會伊麗莎，瓊勃勞斯，一個寒冬之晚，也就暖洋洋的過去了。而况風流，神秘，浪漫······的字眼，正閃着亮晶晶的眼珠子，在準瞧着她們呢？</p>

<p>有一件事是太煞風景的，偌大的首都，就沒一家跳舞塲。放過洋，喝過海水的少爺們，整日價咀咒着：［南京，沙漠裏的冬天啊！］電影院片子太差了，夫子廟歌女的照會也不興，大世界遊藝塲更下劣，只有；［上海去吧！］於是星期六下午，頭二等京滬車的生意，特别好起來。</p>
<p>［封翁］們，鬍鬚還撂不上一把呢，披件黑大　，登上自備包車，的鏜的鏜，拉上夫子廟去，那兒一排排向南，林立着魁光閣，奇芳樓······等大小不下二十多家的茶館子。泡上一壺雨前，吃幾個菜包子，晒在暖暖的太陽光下，談幾句六朝韻事，翻一翻新出的戲報，或是敲上一兩局圍棋，朔風凛冽的冬，犯不着他，也悄悄地息去了。</p>
<p>禁娼禁得嚴，小職員們的生活又枯燥得很，上夫子廟的麟鳳閣，雪園聽歌女們清唱吧，［眼看手勿動，］太沒意思了，而且連飛個紙籠兒，現在也犯了禁，那末，揀個同事家，呌［相好］的來，一張凳子坐着，烘一爐火，碰上三十六圈麻將，冬夜，也不是好好地就過去了嗎？好在自己淘裏不吵出來，警老爺是决不來找麻煩的，誰不知道，這兒雖是做個把小職員，有那個少了着着硬硬的後台呢？</p>
<p>可是就單苦了吃生意飯的小伙計們，西北風一來，好像把他們許多生意也吹掉了，從清早冷冰冰一直挨到晚上，大部分的商店設備還是舊式的，老西北風整天整夜地刮進櫃台上挨着的小夥計，好容易挨到竪排門，一天的烏氣走上大世界去吧。兩角小洋門票，賣一送一，勾搭個［淌白］，胡閙一陣。開房間吧？冬天查得緊，三不時有一對對男女，抓進分駐所。罰幾塊錢事小，一夜［冬官司］眞難挨丨</p>
<p>然而最苦的却還是他們的老板。掛了一塊招牌，撑出一家門面，大不似往年，不景氣把他們一個個弄得愁眉苦臉，背上䭾了許多債，年節到了，怎麽過呢？</p>

<p>我剛從飯館回歸寓所的時候，娘姨投了一封信給我。她說是一位鄕下人送來的，并且還說等一等還要來的。我把信拆開，裏面是這麽地寫着：</p>
<p>［朋友，假如你的腦海裏還殘留着你幾年前的好友的影子，并且願意見一見面的話，那就請你偕送信的人一同來吧。］</p>
<p>這様簡單地幾句話，而且又沒曾署過姓名，這其間的謎，眞呌人摸不着邊際。我反復地辨認着，差不多每一個字的結構和筆性，都很仔細地端詳，然而結果，還是茫茫然。</p>
<p>一會兒，送信的人，果然來了。是於我便問他道：</p>
<p>［誰呌你送來的？］</p>
<p>［少爺呌我送來的。］</p>
<p>［少爺姓什麽。］</p>
<p>［不曉得。］</p>
<p>這様，我沉思了一會，終於决定到那邊走一走。</p>
<p>在通Ｂ着村的路上，我默默地走着，極力地找尋着綫索，從句法上，我斷定是出自老陳的手筆，但立刻又覺得不大準確，無論如何老陳是决不會跑到鄕下去的，何况筆性又是這麽地稚弱。</p>
<p>［那究竟是誰呢？］我暗自追問着自己。</p>
<p>走在前頭的那位鄕下人，他不時地掉轉頭來望望我。也許他會覺得過於奇怪吧，後面的客人，爲什麽儘低着頭瞧着地上呢？</p>
<p>到了Ｂ村，還彎彎曲曲地穿了幾條小巷。最後，在一間古舊的屋旁，新建着的小樓上，遠遠地，我瞧見一位女人倚着欄杆，朝我這邊望着，并且不住地揮着手，我也疑異地儘瞧着她。</p>
<p>緩緩地走近那座小樓，人自然是看得很清楚的，我驚訝地對她點點頭。我眞夢想不到會在此處碰着了好久不見的她，我曾經熱爱過的人兒呵！</p>
<p>［進來吧。］她笑着，接着回轉身，高聲地說：</p>
<p>［客人來了。］</p>
<p>我抱着滿腔興奮，而又摻雜着當時那一幕悲痛的慘别的回味，踱進裏面去。</p>
<p>樓梯雜亂地響着。她下來了，後面跟着一位陌的男人，手抱着一個玲瓏可愛的小孩。</p>
<p>［我眞夢想不到我們有今天的這一會面，］她微微地笑，隨卽指着那位陌生的男人說：</p>
<p>［這是我的丈夫。］接着從她們丈夫的手上，抱過了小孩，敎他呌聲［伯伯。］小孩很羞怯地躱在她的懷裏，</p>
<p>我默無一言地着，其實我還有什麽話說呢！</p>

<p>— 僑生</p>
<p>買書的習慣是好的。然而，有的時候是不好；有的人也是不好。譬如適值很窮困的時候，吃飯問題都難得解决，有一天經過一家書店，看見剛印出了一本新書；而這本新書恰又是自家所愛讀的，便盡其所有買了來。這様，書雖然有了，肚子飢起來了呢？有的人，事實上每月之所得只能應付家用，决無餘錢可以買書，而偏偏要去逛書店，弄得生活也成了問題；這些例子，均可以看出，買書固是美德，也不是人人所能做得到的。</p>
<p>我是喜歡買點書的人。然而，却也爲了沒有那麽許多錢而苦惱着。前天在商務書館看見新到了一本ＳｏｖｉｃｔＬｌｔｅｒａｔｕｒｅ，内容非常豐富，翻了半天，因爲價值美金兩元半而不敢買，也的確是買不起。中文書呢，價錢是便宜多了，如一本靄理斯的［蕭伯訥傳］被翻譯過來也只賣兩塊錢，不可謂不便宜了。那裏知道我那一天連兩塊錢也沒有。所以，結果只好空手出來！</p>
<p>然而，書却到底要看的。於是我想到買舊書的法子了。</p>
<p>其實，如過去不久四馬路各書店賣便宜書的時候，去好好地找幾部書來是很值得的。因爲，書雖然出了不少時候，本子却並不十分破壞；而價格都在五折以下。那時節，我花了半天工夫，找了許多從前想買而買不起的書。就拿最近來說，我又在一家書店用九分錢的代價買得王爾德的［道　格雷　　］；這是我早已想看看的一部唯美派名著。拿了這本書回來，坐在燈下讀着的愉快是不可言喻的。世界上儘有許多好讀書的人，希望都能買到他們心愛的書。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Mayor of Beiping, Yuan Liang, arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 1st to discuss with the central government the progress of constructing a cultural and tourist area in Beiping and to seek instructions on the issue of provincial and municipal boundary demarcation. He stayed at the Central Hotel. On the morning of the 2nd, at 8:00 AM, he visited key officials of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss all related matters. He is scheduled to visit President Wang and Chairman Chiang on the morning of the 3rd and then proceed to Shanghai to visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi. Yuan Liang's visit to Nanjing is reportedly concerning the construction of the Beiping tourist area, under the name of the "Old Capital Cultural Relics Restoration Plan," with a budget of approximately three million yuan. The initial phase will focus on restoring existing scenic spots and historical sites, as well as all buildings, followed by urban renewal. A special request for central government subsidies has been made. The issue of boundary demarcation between Beiping and Hebei is currently under negotiation. Beiping's financial situation is said to be balanced in terms of revenue and expenditure, and local order is stable. Beiping's police training has always been good, and recent improvements have made it even more reliable. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Former Commander of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression Army, Gu Zhutong, following an order from the Nanchang Headquarters, dissolved the headquarters on November 30th and established the Jiangxi Pacification Headquarters in Ji'an on December 1st, assuming office first and scheduling a formal swearing-in ceremony for a later date. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Longyan: The Eastern Route Headquarters has been ordered to close down. All wartime organizations under its jurisdiction will be completely abolished by the end of November. Jiang Dingwen has been appointed as the Director of the Fujian Pacification Office, and it is reported that the Eastern Route Headquarters will be reorganized into the Pacification Office according to the new structure, with the location remaining in Zhangzhou, pending Jiang's return to Fujian to prepare for the organization. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Zhangzhou reports that after the establishment of the Fujian Pacification Office in Zhangzhou on the 1st, Jiang Dingwen immediately sent out a telegram assuming office. The internal organization will be announced after the completion of the headquarters' closing procedures and Jiang's return. Furthermore, it has been learned that the demarcation of the nine, ten, eleven, and twelve pacification zones in Fujian, along with the commanders, will be: Zone One for the Fujian Sea area, commander Wei Lihuang; Tingzhou, Zhangzhou, Longyan, commander Li Yannian; Yanping, Jianning, Shaowu, commander Liu Heding; Xingquan, Yong'an, commander Wang Jingjiu.

<p>Nanchang Telegram: To All News Agencies: Respectfully, the Military Affairs Commission Chairman's Nanchang Headquarters has telegraphed, stating that all combat formations of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian-Hunan-Hubei five-province bandit suppression, including the Southeast and Northwest Route Armies, as well as the reserve armies, etc., should be dissolved by November 30th. Furthermore, the Nanchang Headquarters has telegraphed, stating that Gu Zhutong is appointed as the Director of the Jiangxi Pacification, and all pacification arrangements should be implemented from December 1st. Besides submitting to the National Government for appointment and the separate issuance of credentials and seals, this telegram is sent for compliance. Upon receiving this, we respectfully closed the Northern Route Headquarters on November 30th and established the Jiangxi Pacification Headquarters in Ji'an on December 1st, assuming office first and scheduling a formal swearing-in ceremony for a later date. I have presumptuously assumed this heavy responsibility, and I fear that my abilities are insufficient to meet the challenge. I hope that you will provide timely guidance to prevent me from failing in my duties. Respectfully reported, may you consider this. Gu Zhutong, Director of the Jiangxi Pacification, respectfully bows to the East.</p>
<p>Zhangzhou Telegram: To All Newspapers: Respectfully, Chairman Chiang's telegram from the Nanchang Headquarters states that Jiang Dingwen is appointed as the Director of the Fujian Pacification, and credentials and seals will be issued separately.

I humbly believe that the communist bandits have deeply afflicted and poisoned the Fujian province, and I fear that I am inadequate for this new appointment. I hope that all colleagues, compatriots, and gentlemen will provide advice and guidance, which I will follow. This is my sincere plea. Respectfully reported, I hope you will consider this.

<p>(Nanchang) On the afternoon of the 28th, a certain brigade of a certain division captured Ge Yuan, the old nest of the Fang bandits on the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Anhui border. Ge Yuan is located between Hengfeng, Dexing, Shangrao, and Yushan. The bandit troops of the pseudo-Min-Zhe-Gan province, the pseudo-Tenth Army, the 83rd and 87th regiments, and the Shangrao Independent Battalion, etc., built fortifications on the surrounding mountains of Ge Yuan to control key points. Two regiments bravely climbed and eventually defeated the bandits, destroying the pseudo-Jiangxi East Military Headquarters, the Min-Zhe-Gan Provincial Government, the Fifth Branch of the Red Army School, the Shangrao County Government, the New Communist Training Center, the Pseudo-Agricultural School, the Pseudo-Postal Administration, the Military Hospital, the Pseudo-level Party Headquarters, and the Pseudo-Economic Association. Since the Fang bandit's base has been captured by our forces, the bandits on the border of the three provinces can be eliminated. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Five Mines in Tangshan have been under strict security for days. The mine's security team is armed and deployed day and night. It is rumored that a certain Guo, commissioned by the traitor Zhao Dazhong, is secretly inciting miners within the Five Mines.

After verification by the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, the bureau dispatched Captain Luo Weifang with over ten soldiers on the 2nd to escort them to the Ping Tianjin Garrison Headquarters.

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the question of whether the Oriental Travel Agency will continue to operate the Beiping-Shenyang train service, Yin Tong and relevant parties are currently in Tianjin to discuss the matter. The vehicle conference held by the Oriental Travel Agency the other day only discussed technical aspects. Whether the Oriental Travel Agency will continue to operate the service will be decided within the day. The agency had previously negotiated with the China Travel Agency, intending to terminate the trial operation at the end of this year, and had notified Yin Tong. Yin requested instructions from the responsible authorities, who still favored the continuation of the service by the Oriental Travel Agency, a third party. However, the agency is unwilling to continue. Yin is currently in contact with the agency's manager, Zhang Shuiqi, and Shan [name], etc. It is rumored that a Japanese, Hirayama, will continue the Beiping-Shenyang train service, but whether this will be realized remains questionable.

<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Provincial Government implemented its reorganization today. All department heads and committee members were sworn in. Each department will begin handover procedures separately from the 3rd. Because all handover procedures were prepared early, the entire takeover can be completed by the 4th. Yu Xuezhong is scheduled to come to Beiping on the 5th to pay respects. (Special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hebei Chairman Yu Xuezhong, Committee Members Zhang Houwan, Wei Jian, Lu Muting, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Yinwu, Zheng Daoru, Hu Yuanhui, and Yao Yao held an inauguration ceremony at the provincial government auditorium at 10:00 AM today. The national emblem of the Kuomintang party was displayed in front of the government gate, and representatives from party, government, judicial, and police agencies, as well as guests from various circles, were invited to attend the ceremony. He Qigong, representative of the Central Government and Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, served as the oath supervisor. After the ceremony, He Qigong delivered a speech stating that the Central Government originally intended to send Chairman Huang [name] to supervise the oath, but due to illness, he was replaced by He. Hebei has been a national defense line since last year, and its importance is paramount among the provinces. Chairman Yu has been in office for three years, and his past efforts and achievements are commendable for his ability to handle the environment and maintain local stability in a humble manner. The committee members have many years of political experience or have participated in revolutionary work with considerable history. With this reorganization, it is hoped that they will continue to work diligently with Chairman Yu to move forward, for the benefit of the country and the benefit of the region. (1st) (Special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Jiaji, representative of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, continued He Qigong's speech, stating that the Central Government considers this reorganization of the Hebei Provincial Government to be of great importance. Therefore, the decision was made to retain Chairman Yu for the position. Hebei Province has suffered from internal and external troubles for years, and the local area has been unstable. Through Chairman Yu's governance, it has been roughly stabilized. In the future, efforts should be made to promote construction work and serve as a model for other provinces. Subsequently, Yu Xuezhong replied that he has felt inadequate in his role as Chairman of Hebei for the past two years. This reorganization of the provincial government is due to the Central Government's continued appointment. He will follow the instructions of the Central Government and the representatives of the Political Readjustment Committee, strive for diligence and self-improvement, and live up to the expectations of the Central Government. After the ceremony, a photograph was taken. New Provincial Committee member Zhang Yinwu and Zheng Daoru arrived in Tianjin by car this morning. Zhang stated that he had not heard of his appointment as the Director of the Construction Department and that the newspaper reports may be premature. Zheng stated that he would make a decision after contacting the former director regarding the Education Department. Zhang Houwan is scheduled to take over the Civil Affairs Department on the 3rd. (1st) (Special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hebei Civil Affairs Director Zhang Houwan expressed his political views for governing Hebei: 1. Strictly prohibit opium and drugs; 2. Revitalize rural areas; 3. Rectify the police and security forces; 4. Eliminate the separation between officials and the people. At noon today, Yu Xuezhong hosted a banquet in the provincial government auditorium, inviting He Qigong and Yu Jiaji, with the new and old provincial committee members as guests. In the afternoon, the provincial government hosted a banquet for the new committee members to celebrate. (2nd) (Special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because Zhang Yinwu has not accepted the position of Director of the Construction Department, Yu Xuezhong has sought the opinion of Hu Yuanhui and intends to recommend Hu for the position. (2nd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Wang Dianyuan, the leader of the Liaodong Volunteer Army, had 8,000 troops and over 7,000 guns. After the death of General Deng Tiemei, he was the largest force among the Volunteer Army. For a year, the Japanese and puppet troops repeatedly attacked, but all efforts were unsuccessful, and the total number of casualties was in the thousands. Recently, Wang led his troops to operate in Tonghua, Erdaojiang, and Sandaojiang, fighting against the Japanese army. The Japanese and puppet troops were unable to achieve success and retreated. Wang then led several subordinates to rest in the residence of a Li family in Shilianzi, Erdaojiang. Unexpectedly, he was betrayed by his subordinates, who secretly led a large force of Japanese and puppet troops to surround them. Wang led over ten people in resistance, but eventually succumbed to the onslaught and was killed by bullets. Because the Japanese army feared him, they later beheaded him and sent his head to Shenyang for public display. The Li family of the residence also perished. Wang's troops came to rescue upon hearing the news, but it was too late. The chief of staff is currently leading the troops to Sandaojiang to await orders. (2nd) (Special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a report from outside the pass, the Volunteer Army under Miao Kexiu in the Dong Province Triangle area is still estimated by the Japanese side to have 8,000 men, but the actual number is likely to be around 10,000. The Japanese and puppet troops have not been victorious in their attacks on the area. Recently, it has been rumored in Shenyang that Miao Kexiu himself is not dead and that the deceased was his follower, Liu. The Japanese and puppet troops in Tonghua and other places have recently increased their defenses. The strength of the Volunteer Army is evident. (2nd) (Special dispatch)</p>

The total annual business revenue for shops is 72.34 million yuan, with the largest being grain and rice sales, accounting for over 7.217 million yuan, followed by foreign and sundry goods sales, accounting for over 6.525 million yuan. Cigarette and silk fabric businesses each account for approximately 5 million yuan. In the past, the annual export of silk velvet reached 2-3 million yuan, but it has now been completely eliminated. The total value of foreign goods entering the market annually reaches over 22 million yuan, with building materials and food being the most numerous. Nanjing can be considered a purely consumer city. Recently, various banks from Shanghai have established branches in Nanjing, increasing the number to over 20. In 1931, there were as many as 68 money shops, but in the past year or two, due to the impact of the economic recession, they have successively closed down. Only about 20 remain, with a turnover of only 1-2 million yuan. There are 7 pawnshops with an annual turnover of approximately 3 million yuan. In terms of transportation, there are two bus companies, Jiangnan and Xinghua, with 67 buses. There are 1,378 private cars, 3,126 bicycles, 10,188 rickshaws, and 335 horse-drawn carriages in the city. In addition, the number of small sailboats transporting goods on inland rivers has slightly increased, totaling 9,056. There are approximately 20 small steamers operating on various county and town lines. There are 67 transfer companies (all in Xiaguan and Pukou) and 29 customs brokers. (2nd) (Special dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Training Supervision Department Decides on Centralized Training Methods <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Training Supervision Department recently convened a meeting in Nanjing with the chairmen and members of the provincial and municipal civil and military training committees. Except for Fujian and Guangdong, all provinces and cities have arrived in Nanjing successively. After days of deliberation, the locations for centralized training in the summer of next year have been decided. Whether each province and city will establish a centralized training location or base it on the number of schools in each province and city still needs to be discussed with the Ministry of Education. Because Shanghai has implemented military training in over 70 schools, with a population of nearly 10,000, a large square will be sought for the training. (2nd) (Special dispatch)</p>

Local police agencies are also investigating whether residents who have installed wireless radios are only listening to news from within the puppet state. If they are secretly listening to news from within the pass, they will be arrested and accused of being anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese.

<h3 id="e38">Abolish Oppressive Levies and Supervise Tax Administration <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes has long been a unanimous call from the people. The current fiscal conference took this as one of its four major topics. After deliberation, it was decided that from July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China until the end of December, local authorities should, based on their circumstances, abolish them one by one, sooner or later, to alleviate the suffering of the people. According to the years of disturbance caused by harsh taxes, much is due to the corruption of collection methods, while the actual revenue for the public is not much. If good taxes can be organized, burdens shared equally, embezzlement eliminated, and expenditures adjusted, then the abolition of harsh taxes will not be very difficult. However, the current conference still believes that during the period when provinces and cities are preparing for local autonomy, there are many undertakings that should be carried out, and the reliance on miscellaneous taxes for funding is countless. If proper planning is not done and only the reduction or exemption of various taxes is ordered, it may be a case of "throwing out the baby with the bathwater." Therefore, it was carefully decided that from the next year, the stamp tax, a central government revenue item, will be prioritized as a subsidy for local areas, and the entire tobacco and alcohol license tax will be assigned to local areas for collection. The judicial expenditure item, which was originally paid by local areas, will also be borne by the central government once the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Judicial Administration have a solution. Such painstaking effort and meticulous consideration are all about considering both the legal and practical aspects, and seeking a way to [mutually support both domestic and international affairs].</p>
<p>Now, according to repeated reports from the Ministry of Finance's Local Tax Consolidation Committee, the tobacco and alcohol license tax, which the central government uses to compensate local areas, was allocated to local areas on July 1st. With the power of local administrative authority as a strong driving force, tax revenues have generally increased. The stamp tax item has also been sold by post offices since November. As long as the assessment and collection are appropriate, tax revenues will definitely be considerable. With such ample compensation for all the harsh taxes, they should no longer exist. If local areas still delay and wait and see, or make excuses to shirk responsibility, they will not only be defying the central government's laws and regulations, but also failing the expectations of our people. With our own vital interests at stake, how can we not promptly correct them and allow them to continue to be exploited?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the current fiscal conference also considered this and made a resolution to establish provincial and municipal tax supervision committees. According to the information, except for provinces and cities that have already established councils, the Ministry of Finance will select five to seven impartial individuals with good reputations in the province or city and submit their names to the Executive Yuan for appointment as committee members. The committee's powers are fivefold: (1) Investigate the harsh and miscellaneous taxes and collection situation within the territory. (2) Study methods for consolidating taxes within the territory. (3) Report to the provincial and municipal governments and finance bureaus on the tax situation and consolidation methods within the territory. (4) Report to the Control Yuan on illegal taxes and the illegal behavior of tax agency personnel within the territory. The intention is to give the people the opportunity to participate in the consolidation of local finances and to respect the people's right to supervise local finances.</p>
<p>Now, the deadline for abolishing harsh taxes at the end of last year is less than a month away. It has been repeatedly reported that local areas have been able to uphold the central government's intentions, sympathize with the people's suffering, and implement abolition. However, there may still be cases of those who outwardly comply but inwardly resist. Our country is vast, transportation is difficult, and local situations are extremely isolated. Often, the people's grievances are not conveyed to the higher authorities, and the people's opinions cannot be expressed. General corrupt officials can then deceive the central government and engage in private gain and corruption. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance has already submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval a decision to organize provincial and municipal tax supervision committees as previously agreed. The selection of committee members has also been extensively consulted. Those who are selected by the government to serve as committee members should be keenly aware of the importance of their mission and should not abandon their responsibilities, make excuses to shirk responsibility, or be intimidated by violence and remain silent. As for the local authorities, they should stimulate their conscience and cooperate with each other to consolidate local finances and relieve the people's suffering. Now is the time. Now is the time.</p>

<p>Warm Springs, USA A swimming pool here today had four people wearing swimsuits, discussing matters of great importance to the future of the United States. After the talk, all four jumped into the pool and each drank a glass of fruit juice. These four people were President Roosevelt, Federal Relief Administrator Hopkins, the newly appointed Director of the Recovery Administration Lee Geber, and Undersecretary of Agriculture and key member of the [Brain Trust] Tugwell. They discussed the recovery bills that the government should propose in the next Congress and closer coordination between the New Deal departments. It is reported that a decision has been made regarding government proposals, but the nature of this decision has not yet been revealed. (National Telegraph, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt is currently touring the southern states and will soon return to Washington. However, he will face a difficult problem to be resolved by the President. According to Federal Relief Administrator Hopkins, he advocates requesting approximately 900 million yuan from Congress to completely solve the unemployment and relief problem. However, some people in the Relief Administration advocate reducing federal government expenses and hope to promote economic recovery so that private enterprises can hire more workers. Then, the unemployment and relief problem will be solved easily. Which of the two will prevail will depend on the President's decision. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Deeply in Accordance with the Intentions of the Youth Faction</p>
<p>Republican Progressive Senator Borah today demanded that the party be completely reorganized. Borah said that the members of the Republican National Committee must be changed, and he indicated that the chairman of the Executive Committee, Fulan Que, and the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, Snell, must both be removed from their positions. Borah's demands are deeply in accordance with the views of the party's youth faction. The youth leaders believe that Fulan Que's recent speech, which stated that the Republican Party should follow the policies set by former President Hoover and remain conservative, because the American people will soon abandon President Roosevelt's policies and demand a return to the old situation, is the reason for their repeated failures over the past two years. Moreover, Fulan Que has never been enthusiastic about welcoming younger party members, which has also caused various dissatisfactions. Some political observers believe that the Democratic and Republican parties in American politics will both disappear and be replaced by two new parties, Liberal and Conservative. Over the past two years, party lines have often been blurred. The progressive faction of the Republican Party has long become Democrats, and the conservative faction of the Democratic Party has long become Republicans. This election also took supporting or opposing the New Deal as the point of contention, rather than party affiliation. (National Telegraph, 1st)</p>

<p>Meeting in London Again at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Budapest The representatives of the world's four major wheat exporting countries, who recently attended the International Wheat Conference here, will gather in London at the end of this month to reach a compromise. The Wheat Advisory Committee today issued a public statement explaining the reasons why a resolution could not be reached at the international conference. It is said that a resolution had to be delayed until the major wheat exporting countries reached a compromise. According to news from Paris, the cabinet has passed a bill that the French government will purchase excess wheat reserves from 1933 to 1934, at a cost of more than 33 million pounds. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, Canadian Wheat Board Chairman Macfarlane is currently consulting with the US Department of Agriculture on transporting 15 million or 20 million bushels of frost-damaged wheat into the US to be used as livestock feed. It is reported that the US Treasury Department will allow this wheat to enter the country, levying a special tax of 10 percent on the value instead of the usual tax of 42 cents per bushel.

<p>(Washington) The US government today instructed Ambassador Grew in Japan that the US refuses to negotiate directly with the [Manchukuo] government regarding the oil monopoly issue. The State Department also instructed Grew to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government against the [Manchukuo] oil monopoly, because this kind of measure violates the Four-Power Treaty's responsibility to maintain the Open Door policy. Grew has considerable freedom regarding protest procedures, but the original position of the United States must be adhered to. It is understood that Britain has also refused to recognize [Manchukuo] as an independent government and that all protests must be submitted directly to it. (National Telegraph, 1st)</p>
<p>Singapore The British Navy is concentrating here today to participate in joint naval, land, and air force exercises to test the strength of Singapore's defenses. The exercise will begin on the 12th of this month. Warships stationed in China have also arrived here to prepare for the exercise. On Sunday, the aircraft carrier Eagle, the destroyer Vittoren, and the Wayke arrived here to anchor, marking the first use of the newly built naval port. There will be twenty-one warships coming from China, and the other land and air forces will also participate in full force. It is said that the naval commander intends to test what would happen if Singapore were attacked and the defense force only had torpedo boats and airplanes. The cause of this exercise is said to be the influence of recent developments in the Pacific. The near failure of the London Naval Talks, Japan's desire to abolish the existing naval treaty, and the increasingly serious commercial competition between Britain and Japan have completely broken the old British-Japanese alliance. All of this is the cause of this exercise. Singapore is the most important link between the Suez Canal and Australia. Australia is very anxious about defense. Former Prime Minister Hughes recently said, "Australia is the most vulnerable country in the world.

<p>After the Expiration of the Washington Treaty</p>
<p>A New Treaty Will Be Signed, Valid for Ten Years</p>
<p>(London) The naval talks are now showing new hope that a new treaty can be signed after the expiration of the Washington Treaty, with a term of ten years. According to the new treaty, all signatories must first announce their naval programs for the first five years of the treaty. What will happen in the latter five years has not yet been decided, but if the signatories are not willing to compete in building warships at that time, a meeting may be held to decide the naval programs of the countries in the latter five years of the treaty. Well-informed sources now believe that Japan will definitely agree to this treaty. However, it is said that Japan now keenly wants to know Britain's more detailed needs under this treaty.</p>
<p>When Japanese chief delegate Yamamoto went to the British Admiralty yesterday, the department provided him with a lot of information. However, British and Japanese naval experts still seem to need to continue talking. The Japanese delegation will continue to exchange views with the Tokyo government before it can announce its practical decision.</p>
<p>US chief delegate Davis has not yet expressed his attitude towards the proposed new treaty, but has telegraphed his government for instructions. It is said that the new treaty will not mention ratios. However, Japan will reveal the [implied] or non-numerical ratios, which can be interpreted as allowing Japan a naval position superior to the current 5:5:3 ratio.</p>
<p>The British representatives are now making every effort to prevent the complete failure of the naval talks. The British representatives believe that if the Japanese delegation leaves London without reaching an understanding, all hope will be lost. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) The preliminary negotiations on disarmament are now becoming increasingly deadlocked. Representative Yamamoto plans to meet with US Representative Admiral Standley as soon as possible this week in an effort to break the deadlock. The outcome of this meeting between the US and Japanese representatives will determine whether the preliminary consultations can be established and have a major impact. All parties are paying close attention. (Japan Union Telegraph, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that the US delegation plans to return home before Christmas, at the latest by the 15th of this month, and plans to withdraw from London. Talks will be held within the next week to determine its success or failure. It has now urged the British side, but the British side's attitude is not anxious and intends to discuss it calmly. The preliminary consultations this week are generally considered to have reached the final stage. (Japan Union Telegraph, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The French ambassador to Japan yesterday informed Foreign Minister Hirota that he rejected the joint abolition of the Washington Treaty. Italy will also notify its rejection on the 3rd, similar to France. Foreign Minister Hirota has internally decided to officially decide on the 4th's cabinet meeting to formally decide that Japan will unilaterally notify the abolition and adopt the procedure of requesting imperial consultation.

<p>An Excerpt from an Interview with the US Ambassador to Britain</p>
<p>(London) The London Observer today published an excerpt from an interview with US Ambassador to Britain Bingham, who said that if Britain and the United States seize the current opportunity and engage in close diplomatic cooperation, world panic can be eliminated and various diplomatic problems can be easily solved. The opportunity for better understanding and closer cooperation between the people of Britain and the United States has never been greater or more numerous than it is today. The American saying "the proposer is the President, the decision-maker is Congress" is no longer accurate. It must be known that no US President has ever increased his majority in the mid-term elections. Only President Roosevelt has done so. If Britain reaches an understanding with President Roosevelt, it is tantamount to establishing a lasting understanding with the United States. President Roosevelt will never submit to Congress any bill that he is not sure Congress will agree to. If Britain and the United States agree on a solution to any diplomatic problem, no coalition of forces can resist it. Wall Street no longer commands Washington. Dollar diplomacy is over. The United States now has a brand new and reliable foundation for confidential diplomacy. In view of the recent remarks by British Privy Councilor Baldwin and South African Minister of Justice Smuts regarding the direction of British policy, the opinions expressed by US Ambassador Bingham today are considered to have special significance.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota answered questions from Mr. Nakano Masataka in the House of Representatives on the 1st as follows: As for why he did not abolish the Washington Naval Treaty earlier, our country's disarmament policy was originally a firm and unchangeable decision. However, he also felt that he could not but consult with the various countries and gain their understanding. Therefore, it is a natural trend to observe the situation of the preliminary consultations. Some may think that my policy is too courteous, but it is actually out of necessity. As for the opening of China's doors, I hope that it will be handled as soon as possible. (Japan Union Telegraph, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) If the London talks stop as a result of the Japanese government's notification of the abolition of the Washington Treaty, Foreign Minister Hirota will order Ambassador Matsudaira to return home in order to handle diplomatic work with Britain. Ambassador Matsudaira had previously revealed his intention to retire bravely. He will be retained. If his intention is firm, he will be succeeded by Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Yoshizawa Kenkichi, or Yoshida Shigeru. (Dentsu Telegraph, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the joint abolition of the Washington Treaty was rejected by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, the government decided to take the procedure of unilateral abolition as soon as the temporary parliament is completed. Foreign Minister Hirota said that after the notification, the relationship between Japan and the international community will inevitably become tense for a time, which is unavoidable. We must not be pessimistic, but must give full play to the essence of harmonious diplomacy. Therefore, we have decided to adjust international relations. In preparation for this, taking the opportunity of Ambassador to Germany Nagai's resignation, we will transfer the ambassadors to major European and American countries to refresh the personnel. The people who will be transferred include Ambassador to Turkey Mushanokoji Kintomo succeeding Nagai as Ambassador to Germany. The current Ambassador to Canada Tokugawa Iemasa will succeed as Ambassador to Turkey, and Counselor Kato Gaiji of the British Embassy will be promoted to Ambassador to Canada. In addition, Ambassador to Russia Ota, who is returning home on the 9th, intends to resign, so he will be succeeded by Director of the Trade Bureau Kurisu. In addition, Minister to Portugal Kasama Kao, who is returning home, has also decided to retire bravely. Other ministers, such as Minister to Rome Fujita Eisuke, Minister to Mexico Hori Yoshiki, and Minister to Australia Matsunaga Naoji, also intend to retire bravely. Therefore, their appointments will be promoted: Minister to Persia Okamoto Takezo, Counselor of the US Embassy Fujii Keinosuke, Consul General in Calcutta Miyake Tetsujiro, and Consul General in Batavia Yukida Soichiro, etc. (Dentsu Telegraph, 2nd)</p>

<p>Ooguchi Questions and Takahashi Answers</p>
<p>(Tokyo) House of Representatives The first day of the Budget General Meeting opened at 10:25 a.m. on the 2nd. Ooguchi Kiharu began questioning as follows:</p>
<p>Since Showa 4, Japan's finances have gradually increased the deficit public debt. The budget for the 10th year, which has already been decided, has reached 2.19 billion yuan, and the deficit public debt has also reached 750 million yuan. Among them, the military budget has exceeded 1 billion yuan, and even the budgets of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have been reduced. The parts of the 10th year budget for the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have been greatly reduced compared to Showa 8. As a result, local finances have been impoverished for a long time, and there is no rural industry. Then there can be no real national defense. How should finance and national defense be arranged? How should the so-called national policy be formulated? I hope the Prime Minister will give a clear answer.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada answered that Ooguchi-kun should already understand the details of the budget. This reply should be left to the ministers in charge. Then Minister of Finance Takahashi stood up and replied:</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of national policy should be to give diplomacy the highest priority, with national defense as the second. To strengthen national defense, it is necessary to harmonize the national economy. This matter was already decided during the Saito Cabinet, and the Okada Cabinet must also follow this policy.</p>
<p>Ooguchi continued to show off his tongue and deliberately made things difficult for the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. At noon, the meeting was temporarily adjourned. From 1:00 p.m., Sugiyama Motojiro launched a fierce attack on the government and submitted four bills to the committee for review before the meeting was adjourned. However, Ooguchi's questions and the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance's answers had lasted for four hours, and the situation can be said to be heated. (Japan Union Telegraph, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Where Britain's True Intentions Lie <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, Yamamoto, the chief Japanese specialist, presented his personal views to Admiral Chatfield, the British Chief of Naval Staff. His intentions were nothing more than two main points: first, technical experts should meet together to discuss the numbers so that they can easily understand each other; second, British naval leaders should clearly understand that the total tonnage system advocated by Japan is far less alarming than extending the existing treaty's restrictions. Yamamoto's remarks were mostly directed at British naval circles. Naval Admiral Keyes, a famous veteran of the British Navy, has repeatedly declared in recent months that if the London Naval Treaty is continued, it would be an unforgivable betrayal of national interests. Other responsible people in naval circles have also said that the 5:5:3 ratio stipulated in the Washington Treaty is purely for the convenience of American naval strategy. In addition, British Admiralty spokesman Beaverbrook recently published an article in the [Fortnightly Review] stating that the relative strength and absolute strength of the British Navy have been greatly weakened compared to before it was restricted by the treaty. The superior position of the British Navy in 1921-22 has now become a thing of the past and is no longer to be mourned. The so-called equality between the British and American navies is only equality on paper. If you don't believe it, you can compare warships of all classes. The United States, if necessary, must maintain its Open Door policy in the Far East, and fifteen battleships of 35,000 tons each are sufficient. Conversely, based on the experience of the Great War, Britain must have two main fleets, one to be ready to be dispatched to any place where an emergency occurs, and the other to guard the European seas. Therefore, Britain must have at least 20 battleships. As for the tonnage of battleships, it is not a big problem to reduce it to a limit of 25,000 tons. This is one. As for cruisers, the same is true. The main purpose of American cruisers is to cross the Pacific Ocean to the Far East, while the purpose of British cruisers is to protect merchant ships that supply Britain. The London Treaty stipulates that Britain has 50 cruisers, which is too few, and the tonnage of each cruiser is limited to 10,000 tons, which is too high. This is two. Finally, in terms of destroyers and submarines, the restrictions of the current treaty are also impractical. What's more, France and Italy did not sign the London Treaty and are not subject to its restrictions. This is three. For this reason, if Britain acknowledges Japan's principle of naval total tonnage equality, its harm is not as great as maintaining the current restrictions. Therefore, Britain has the possibility of accepting Japan's demands after weighing the gains and losses. In particular, well-informed sources in Britain believe that Japan's finances are exhausted. Even if it is given naval equality, it cannot actually achieve equality with Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is more than willing to accept Japan's demands. However, the final decision on Britain's attitude belongs to the government authorities. At present, any actions that would damage American sympathy for Britain are particularly unacceptable to public opinion. Therefore, even if Britain accepts Japan's demands, it cannot but have some concerns. However, since the British naval community has a tendency to oppose the current naval treaty, coupled with Japan's diplomatic activities, it may eventually become a decision over time, which is also to be expected.

<p>Detroit The northern United States, from the Great Lakes to the Pacific coast, is suffering from severe cold, followed by heavy snow. The temperature in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri is low, which is rare in previous years. The streets of several cities in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are covered by heavy snow, and traffic has stopped. A large area of Northern California has been flooded. Poor people are not feeling distressed. Many ships in Muskegon, Michigan, have been wrecked due to the wind. One cargo ship was blown ashore, and 25 sailors spent the night in the wrecked ship. They were rescued the next morning and were almost stiff from the cold, so they were sent to the hospital for treatment. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson, in his annual report for 1934 released today, reiterated that the United States is determined to build warships to the limits permitted by naval treaties. At the same time, he stated that if other countries are willing to reduce their naval power, the United States is also willing to reduce accordingly. He added that he firmly believes that to protect the national interests at risk, the U.S. Navy should be no less capable than that of any other country. Swanson continued that the most important task of the Navy Department this year was to enact laws, stipulate naval strength, and authorize the construction of warships and aircraft, so that the Navy can reach the strength stipulated by the treaty and replace old ships that have exceeded their service life. This involves the work of seventy warships, which is currently underway. When this project is completed within the next thirty months, the strength of the U.S. Navy will still be short of approximately seventy-eight warships compared to the limits set by the treaty, and it is hoped that Congress will approve the necessary funds annually to replace old ships. Swanson strongly advocated increasing the number of naval officers and soldiers, saying that the number of soldiers required to be recruited next year is 86,815, while the Navy's funding is only sufficient to support 81,500. A navy built to the treaty limits would require at least 7,000 naval officers, so the number of officers should be increased as soon as possible. Swanson then mentioned aviation affairs, saying that he firmly believes that the U.S. Naval Aviation Corps under the current system is no less powerful than that of any other country, and that any hasty changes, such as organizing unified aviation affairs, would be a big mistake. Swanson's report did not touch on the London Naval Conference issue. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Dalian) Recently, land and air parties have repeatedly planned to increase the speed of Japan-Manchukuo transportation. Therefore, Osaka Shosen Kaisha is also secretly contacting the connecting ship project to accelerate it and is starting to establish its specific plan. It is heard that the fundamental conditions of the plan are as follows: 1. The average speed of ships traveling between Japan and Manchukuo should be 22 to 23 knots, and two such ships should be built. 2. They should operate exclusively between Dalian, Moji, and Kobe, or be used exclusively between Dalian and Moji. 3. If they operate as dedicated ships between Moji and Dalian, they must travel daily, and the speed should be reduced by 15 hours compared to the current time. 4. When traveling between Dalian, Moji, and Kobe, the time should be shortened by 45 hours compared to the current time. 5. If shipbuilding starts as early as next spring, navigation can be started in 1936. (2nd Japanese Joint dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) In 1912, the city of Tokyo, Japan, raised a foreign debt of 9.17 million francs, of which 4 million pounds were raised in France. Later, due to the depreciation of paper currency after the war, the city of Tokyo refused to repay in gold francs, leading to a long-standing dispute between the two parties. French bondholders then organized a Gold Loan Committee to handle the matter. Congressman Gerin submitted a written question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding this matter, and Foreign Minister Laval also responded in writing. His reply was published in the government gazette today, stating that, according to a report from the French Embassy in Japan, the foreign debt borrowed by the city of Tokyo in 1912 was used entirely for two purposes: (1) purchasing the materials and equipment of the Tokyo Electric Tramway Company, and (2) expanding the facilities to supply electricity within the city of Tokyo. Since the beginning of the dispute between French bondholders and the Tokyo city government, the French Embassy in Japan has continuously protested to the Japanese government and the Tokyo city government, so that French bondholders can be satisfied, but negotiations have not yet yielded results. The Foreign Minister also stated that if French bondholders agree to be repaid in paper francs, there is no reason to file any lawsuits against the Tokyo city government. The Foreign Minister continued that French bondholders have the right to demand that the city of Tokyo execute the judgment of the French court, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always paid attention to this. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the embassy in Japan to pay attention at all times and to assert France's legitimate demands whenever there is an opportunity.

<p>Rome: Italy has invented a new method for mosquito extermination. The method involves using the oil residue from engines and, through a special chemical method, creating a medicine that is poured into water storage areas in malaria-prone regions, thus eliminating mosquitoes. Traditionally, kerosene has been used for mosquito extermination, which is very expensive. The new method is much cheaper. Prime Minister Mussolini is very interested in this invention and has issued a special decree to commend the inventor and give a generous reward. This method has been tested during the improvement of the Pontine Marshes, and the results have proven to be irresistibly effective in destroying mosquitoes and larvae. The authorities have now drafted a large-scale mosquito extermination plan, which will be implemented starting in March next year. (2nd Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Unstable European Situation <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(National News Agency Geneva Dispatch) In April 1933, France stated in a record of British speeches that France presumed that the negotiations conducted between the powers after October 14, 1933, would come to an end. However, France still demanded a return to Geneva. The record opposed Germany's attempts and argued that France's existing state contained serious statements. If we want to understand the past situation, we should keep in mind the matters discussed by the four powers, as this negotiation has fully developed and is gradually approaching the distant claims of the four major powers. Therefore, there is confidence that a day of harmony and cooperation can be reached. However, at the time of the French speech record, it expressed major disappointment on this. There is now a problem to be studied: Where does France get this serious step from? Upon investigation, the falsity of the reasons in its records is most easily apparent. When France realized that the powers were about to reach a consensus, it should have made a decision and always find a way to cope so that it could oppose the powers, as the equal status it recognized for Germany would have an effect. It no longer avoids it. Therefore, with France aiming to continue discussions with the four major powers, it wanted to transfer this case to Geneva. Its attempt was to adopt a policy of denial in order to obtain beneficial conditions. The French speech record also has another meaning. The reasons for rebuttal throughout the entire piece are still intended to continue empty talk with other fully armed countries in Geneva (without any practical effect) and to open negotiations on the issue of disarmament. Because they have been doing this for eight years, it is still continuing. When the powers (especially France) have been striving to arm themselves for years, Germany and other disarming countries have only endured their actions. In October of last year, it was the spirit of independent judgment that prompted Germany to withdraw from Geneva. France's invitation to countries to return to Geneva is equivalent to asking Germany to acquiesce to discriminatory treatment. This kind of relief plan, for concessions to dark fantasies, only makes various progress difficult. However, this plan has been similar to France's habitual methods in the world since the initial discussions on the topic of disarmament. On the topic of non-disarmament, France has never lost the excuse of ensuring security. France has been singing this tune for many years. After German military experts cited that its claims were dangerous and required close attention, it then neglected management issues. Later, it advocated guarantee issues. After delaying negotiations on promoting guarantee issues, Britain said that it was happy to follow France's claims and requested details of the guarantees it desired, to which France was speechless and closed the door to future discussions. Subsequently, other powers recognized that France was refusing to disarm and insisted on not letting go. When they gathered the efforts of the masses to take consistent action to limit armaments, when the great powers agreed on common principles, France suddenly declared that it would no longer join when the discussions concluded. The reason for its original intention was purely not wanting to be hindered in its plan to increase armaments. It is now difficult to predict what developments will occur. All the solid work completed during the negotiations held in the autumn of last year has been completely destroyed. Regarding the guarantee issue, Britain's plan on January 29, Italy's plan on January 31, Germany's gradual concessions, Britain's provision of needs, etc., are completely rejected. The European political situation is also in a damaged state again, and it is actually because of France's predatory attitude that it purely wants to make</p>

<p>Foreign Minister announces Saar policy</p>
<p>(Paris) The Flandin government today once again won a significant victory in the Chamber of Deputies. During the discussion of the budget of the Ministry of Interior, some deputies demanded the cancellation of the government's secret funds. Flandin opposed this request, saying that this fund was necessary, but the government would never misuse it. Then he used this as a matter of confidence and put it to a vote. This request was ultimately rejected by 457 votes to 120. Subsequently, when Foreign Minister Laval discussed the foreign affairs budget in the Chamber of Deputies, he made an important statement on the Saar issue. Laval answered a question from a deputy, saying that if the Saar plebiscite maintains the status quo, and if the residents of the Saar later petition the League of Nations, the de facto and de jure government of the Saar, to return to Germany, then France would not oppose its return.

<p>(Paris) When the Chamber of Deputies discussed the budget of the Ministry of Interior today, the Socialist and Communist deputies opposed the secret funds of the Ministry of Interior, citing recent scandals as evidence, saying that even in the detective team, there are many evildoers. Therefore, they demanded that all corrupt personnel be removed, and the secret funds saved be used to relieve the poor. Other deputies said that secret funds violate the republican system. To this, Prime Minister Flandin replied, [I regard domestic peace as equally important as foreign peace. Deputies have criticized the way this fund is used, but what they have criticized are all matters of previous governments. If there are indeed corrupt practices in this fund, then I will be responsible for paying attention to ensuring that similar things do not happen again. However, if opposing secret funds is intended to limit the power of the government, then it is something I cannot accept. If you were to take on the position of the government one day, I expect that you would not be able to accept this kind of request either. It must be known that the detective agency is not a weapon, but a means of action. Arguing about this matter is futile. Today, those who oppose secret funds will certainly change their tune and support secret funds once their political friends grasp power.] At this point, Flandin put the issue of the Ministry of Interior's secret funds as a matter of confidence, and the proposal of accepting the government's proposal was passed by 457 votes to 120.

<p>British newspapers express optimism</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers believe that the recent statements made by the British and French governments to Germany are nothing short of a forecast that the current tense situation can be brought to an end. The Observer praised the firm attitude of Lord Privy Seal Baldwin and the speech of French Foreign Minister Laval, saying, "The goal of a five-year truce in Europe has now been achieved. This is not an overstatement." Most British newspapers held an optimistic attitude, as did the Observer. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Prague: Czech newspapers continue to comment on the speech made by French Foreign Minister Laval on foreign policy in the Chamber of Deputies. The "Czech Daily News" today published an editorial commenting specifically on this matter, saying that based on this speech, it can be seen that France opposes changes in territory. Although Laval's speech still maintains France's common policy with the Little Entente countries, it has revealed its signs in the promotion of French-Italian friendship. We firmly believe that such valuable words can consolidate peace. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Vienna: The speech made by French Foreign Minister Laval in the Chamber of Deputies on foreign policy, especially the section on French-German relations, is quite satisfactory to the people here. The Federal Mail commented today, saying that Laval's words were heard here with both gratitude and comfort, as if receiving a savior. The newspaper also said that Laval's speech gave the impression of easing French-German relations, and it is hoped that the German authorities will not turn a deaf ear. It is believed that German officials have repeatedly stated that they do not want the Saar negotiations to fall into a serious situation, and now that they hear Laval's conciliatory words, they must have some understanding.

<h3 id="e64">Eastern European Pact Issue <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>France has proposed a reconciliation method to Poland</p>
<p>Currently waiting for Poland to make a decision</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval stated in a declaration in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday that the French government is currently in negotiations with the German government regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Poland's note of September 27, in which it rejected participation in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, has recently been replied to by the French government. France also intends to give a similar reply to the German government's note of September 13 regarding the same event. However, before Poland expresses its opinion on France's reply, France's note to Germany will not be delivered to the German government. It is said that France's recent reply to Poland has a reconciliation method, hoping that Poland will be able to agree. Therefore, Poland's decision is very important and the responsibility is paramount. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Consulting on the Hungarian issue</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Regent of Yugoslavia, Prince Paul, arrived here, Foreign Minister Laval went to visit him. When someone asked Laval about the content of the conversation, he replied that he could not make a statement about the circumstances of his conversation with a head of state, as this is a diplomatic convention. In addition to Laval, Prince Paul has met with President Lebrun and Prime Minister Flandin for a long time. According to general opinion, this conversation has great significance, that is, the friendship between France and Yugoslavia has become even closer due to the Marseille assassination. Generally speaking, what Prince Paul and the French authorities talked about was nothing more than the general international situation, and they especially focused on Hungary's request for the Executive Council of the League of Nations to immediately discuss the Marseille assassination. Although this request from Hungary is a procedural issue, it is of great significance in the political aspect, and it should be decided by the Executive Council of the League of Nations whether it can be accepted. Roughly, Yugoslavia also wants the Marseille case to be brought up for discussion immediately. The purpose of that country's application to the League of Nations is only to find an opportunity to publicly reveal the responsibilities of certain officials in Hungary. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>

When Titulescu arrived here, he issued a statement saying, [The authorities of various European countries, regardless of each other, all hold a firm desire to maintain peace. This is what I have gained and can sincerely declare.] He also said that he was very satisfied with the results of his talks in Geneva and Paris, and he will go to Geneva at the beginning of next week to do his best to protect Yugoslavia's interests, which is no different from defending Romania's interests.

<p>(Paris) The new French-German trade agreement was signed here yesterday afternoon. Its content is nothing more than extending the old trade agreement concluded in July for three months. According to an official explanation, as the Saar plebiscite is about to be held, both parties are only willing to conclude a short-term agreement. It is reported that the trade representatives of the two countries will still meet in order to establish a final agreement based on a broader basis, but this will still be carried out after the Saar issue is resolved.

<p>(Paris) A new commercial agreement between France and Germany was agreed upon last night and formally signed this afternoon. Its validity period is only three months. According to well-informed sources, the reason why this time limit is so short is nothing more than that important events will soon occur that will be sufficient to change the status quo. As for the issue of repayment of Germany's debt of about 60 million francs, the two parties have reached an agreement, and they are now studying a repayment plan. The content is to collect all French claims before August 1 of this year, and clear them through bank procedures. Furthermore, the agreement on import quotas was not declared abolished today, so it will be automatically extended. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Extreme Opposition Between America and Japan</p>
<p>England Mediates</p>
<p>The Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference, which had been suspended for three months, reopened at 10:30 AM on October 23rd at the British Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. The first meeting involved British representatives MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, Navy Minister Monsell, and several others, along with Japanese representatives Tsuneo Matsudaira, Naval Representative Isoroku Yamamoto, and two others, exchanging opinions. The content of the talks was kept strictly confidential by both sides and not announced to the outside world. Regarding the order of the meeting, it is said that the Japanese representatives merely explained the main points of Japan's disarmament opinions, while the British side posed various questions. The meeting lasted less than two hours. The next day at 10 AM, American representatives Davis and Admiral Standley met with the Japanese representatives at the Claridge's Hotel. The Japanese representatives again explained their position on disarmament. The American side's response, in addition to emphasizing the spirit of peace, expressed the following opinions regarding the talk of equality in armaments:</p>
<p>[It is natural that the security guarantees of all countries should allow them equal rights, which is recognized by the United States. However, countries do not need to have equal armaments, especially if security guarantees are based on a particular country as an opponent, which should not be the security guarantee of other countries. Therefore, it is impossible for a country to feel threatened by other neighboring countries and demand to be allowed to have equal armaments with that country.]</p>
<p>The Japanese side believes that [in any case, there is no other way than to abolish the past ratio system and achieve equality in armaments.] The above is a brief summary and not enough to show the full picture of the London preparatory conference, nor is it sufficient to judge the future outcome. However, the general trend can be seen in general terms. The irreconcilability between the United States and Japan, and the fact that it will become increasingly deadlocked in the future, cannot be concealed. The United States' observations on the Far East are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan has a very active merchant fleet, which is operated very nimbly, and this helps Japan's military preparations from the side. (2) Since the United States has allowed the Philippines to become independent, it is even more of a guarantee that it will not build military fortresses in the Far East. Japan should be very relieved about this and should no longer say that it is insecure about its national defense.</p>
<p>(3) Japan has obtained [Manchuria's] resources, which has greatly increased its wartime capabilities, and its security should also increase accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) Japan is not like the United States, which is located between two major oceans and needs a stronger navy to protect freedom of navigation at sea.</p>
<p>However, what Japan is concerned about is the rapid development of air power, especially the significant progress in heavy bombers. In 1922, the maximum range of an aircraft was no more than 300 miles, but now it has extended to over 2,000 miles. The action radius of battleships at that time was only 2,500 miles, but recently, due to the development of heavy oil engines and other various improvements, the mobility of battleships can extend to more than 3,000 miles. After 1936, after many new ships are built, a 3,500-mile action radius will be concretely realized. In that case, its geographical value will naturally decline a lot. Therefore, Japan will not easily let go of its claim for [equality in armaments]. The United States also believes that the Washington and London treaties are the foundation of peace in the Pacific and even the world. If this foundation is abandoned, a new treaty will inevitably be even more difficult to establish, and there will be even more difficulties in the future.</p>
<p>England also has its fixed position, which is to be the world's dominant naval power. It does not need large ships and cannons, but only wants to have many powerful cruisers. This is tacitly approved by Japan, but difficult for the United States to tolerate. However, England has always been skilled in diplomacy. Since there is irreconcilability between the United States and Japan, it does not need to immediately raise objections, so as not to create a three-way confrontation and cause the overall situation to collapse and become irreparable. Therefore, England wants to act as a mediator to bring the United States' suggestion of maintaining the original ratio and further reducing armaments by 20 percent closer to Japan's claim for [equality in armaments]. However, we see that in the past history of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, the countries involved were unwilling to give up their own interests, such as England's proposal to expand cruisers, which it would not easily concede. The preparatory talks now underway are certainly not as serious as a formal conference, but they can indeed test how future changes will occur. It is a very accurate barometer. Therefore, from the current situation, it is not yet optimistic. (October 25th in London)</p>

<p>Suddenly Heard Bandit Alarm at Hong Liu Yuan</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th, we departed from Bai Dunzi. After leaving the village for three or four li, sand dunes stretched out on both sides, forming a small yellow sandy basin, thinly covered with black and white gravel, resembling Xiaogan sesame candy. Beyond this, salt flats stretched as far as the eye could see, with dry reeds growing on them, shaped like bamboo, two or three feet high, several zhang apart, interspersed with clumps of camel thorn, all of which camels love to eat. After more than ten li, chaotic mountains rose and fell, though not high, they blocked the line of sight. Suddenly, we came to open ground, overlooking the distant mountains, which were lush and beautiful, only revealing their winding and rugged peaks below the horizon. As if there was a vast miasma in front, the shadows of the peaks were reflected in it, undulating with the wind, wonderfully strange. This kind of Gobi miasma is also called malarial air. Some say that if people accidentally touch it, it will inevitably lead to malaria and other diseases, but it is not easy to touch it. But know that this air is visible from a distance, but there is nothing up close. If one sees miasma elsewhere, others see it in oneself, also in the miasma. It is not easy for people to touch it, but they also touch it from time to time, especially without realizing it. As for whether those who touch it get sick or not, it is related to their original health, and it cannot be concluded that it is only the rampages of miasma.</p>
<p>We met a sick youth, about eighteen or nineteen years old, with hair three or four inches long, unkempt like a clump of grass, lips parched and unable to form words, staggering and shouting, "Eight days without food, eight days without food." We gave him steamed buns, which he swallowed hastily and choked on. Observing his clothing and behavior, he must have received three years of military training, even if he did not graduate from middle or primary school. At that time, the cold wind was blowing, and his whole body was shivering. Mr. Su could not bear it and gave him his fur coat. When asked who he was and why he was so miserable, he did not answer. Mr. Su suspected that something was wrong and asked loudly again, "If you don't tell the truth, I won't give you the coat." He still murmured to himself, "Eight days without food." The reporter then pointed to his ear, intending to ask if he was deaf. He shook his head and replied, "Hungry and deaf, hungry and deaf." Unable to get any information, we each went our own way. The camel driver questioned Mr. Su, "Xingxing Gorge is very cold. Why did you give away the old sheepskin coat?" Mr. Su replied, "I have personally experienced the suffering of cold and hunger. Mr. Su walked through Wuyuan and got lost while rushing. He was frozen and hungry by the Yellow River for a whole day and night. Besides, this thing was also given to me by someone. He is sick, so I am willing to give it to him." A certain Western philosopher once had the theory that "human beings have no sympathy." Now, looking at the matter of giving away the coat to a stranger, it can be seen that this is not entirely true.</p>
<p>Forty li away, in a sandy valley, there were several circles of stone-built ruins. After another ten li, stone ridges rose and fell like waves, mostly green, looking like grass from a distance, interspersed with snow-white gravel, like a waterfall. Red willow and green artemisia, clumps every few steps, the autumn scenery of the desert is really no less beautiful than the red maple and green cypress of Jiangnan. Then we arrived at Hong Liu Yuan for the night, a total of seventy li. As soon as we set up our tents, unexpected guests came, telling us that four bandits had been discovered near Xingxing Gorge. It was said that there were still three people in the mountains, and the bandits were carrying a rifle and a pistol each. They had been robbing for three days, and about four groups of merchants had been robbed, seven people had been killed, and the losses included more than thirty camels, more than ten bolts of cloth, and dozens of taels of gold. Xingxing Gorge is still three stations away from here. After discussion, it was decided that the reporter should draft a letter to request the Anxi Ma Regiment Leader to send a team to escort us. The letter was sent back overnight by the merchant Aximu, while the rest of the camel team continued to advance to Daquan and wait. In the middle of the night, the dogs barked wildly. The camel driver heard it and suddenly came out of the tent and roared loudly. When asked, he said that it was a wild wolf trying to attack the camel formation. (Camels walk in single file, which is called a camel team. At night, they lie down in a circle or in a row, which is called a camel formation.) Therefore, the camel driver roared to scare it away. In late autumn and early winter, it is the mating season for wild wolves. After one female, there are always several males following, howling all night, which can be heard for several li. Travelers should be very careful when encountering them.</p>
<p>The next morning, we got up to look around. All we could see was horse lotus grass, and not a single red willow. There was a shallow well built of stone, with clear spring water overflowing outside, enough for ten camels to drink at the same time. There were several acres of fertile land, but no one cultivated it. There were more than twenty abandoned houses within a dozen steps, and temples such as the Guandi Temple and the Lao Jun Hall were also dilapidated. Five li outside the village, the mountains surrounded it on all sides. During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, gold mines were opened in the mountains, and gold miners and shops gathered in Hong Liu Yuan, bustling like a small town. Now, there are only two postmen, one going back and forth to send mail, and the other guarding the dilapidated walls and ruins, resting and working in shifts, like the stars that never meet. Nothing is more desolate in the world. Investigating the reasons for the destruction of the postal stations on the Gansu-Xinjiang road, it was due to the disturbances of Wu Tingzhang and Ma Zhongying since the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. Large groups of troops entered Xinjiang, trampling back and forth, and the residents fled one after another. The houses were all demolished to be used as fuel. (Especially Ma Zhongying, during his second trip to Xinjiang in the twenty-second year, did his best to destroy the postal stations he passed, in order to show his determination to succeed and never return.) As a result, the once prosperous villages and towns often turned into desolate ruins. This is not only the case for Hong Liu Yuan and other stations, but also what we saw along the way after entering Xinjiang. Moreover, from Bai Dunzi in the east to Ma Lianjing in the west, the four stations in Gansu are all important border areas. During the Qing Dynasty, each station had a foreign commissioner stationed with ten soldiers. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Anxi Security Team stationed one soldier. Now, even this one soldier is long gone. No wonder four or five bandits dare to seize the opportunity to rob and plunder.</p>
<p>We set off at ten o'clock. The ridges and peaks undulated and crisscrossed. Although the road was very winding, it was still wide and flat, and cars could pass through it. The mountains were all stone and rock, red, black, blue, and white, clearly visible. After being washed by mountain floods for a long time, the sand and gravel flowed down to form rivers, each presenting colorful borders according to the quality of the mountain, interspersed with artemisia and willow, in neat rows, dazzlingly illuminating, like paving rainbows, which can be quite beautiful. At dusk, we met a postman, with a green square scarf wrapped around his head, wearing a green "postman" jacket, and long leather boots on his feet, dressed quite like a martial arts supporting character in a Peking opera. He was riding a small donkey carrying mail, with nine copper bells hanging on his chest, the donkey walking briskly, and the bells ringing. Asking about the situation ahead, he replied that he had not heard anything. The bandits did not rob the mail, was that true? We stayed overnight at Yaozhan [Xiaoquan], a total of fifty li. There were also no houses in Xiaoquan. Digging sand to get water, two feet deep, the water flowed out immediately, but when the wind rose and the sand flew, it was soon buried. Therefore, those who wanted to give water to the camels often dug it temporarily.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, a camel team suddenly came from a side road. The camel owner, Han Jinfu, often traded between Hami and Suzhou. This time, he was originally going from Dunhuang to Hami, but he heard about the bandit alarm on the way, so he detoured here to join forces. However, he had already detoured five hundred and several tens of li. Han said that there were indeed seven bandits, four of whom were prisoners from Dunhuang Prison who had recently escaped from prison and joined forces to rob. Although there had been several cases of travelers being robbed, Anxi and Hami both had large armies stationed there, and these bandits would be difficult to stay for long.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Second Plenary Session of the War Zone Clearance Committee <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Many Proposals, Meeting Scheduled for Three Days</p>
<p>The Three Current Priorities of the Clearance Work</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The War Zone Clearance Committee was established on the first day of last month. It has been a month. This morning (the 1st) at ten o'clock, the second plenary session was held. Except for Standing Committee member Yin Tong, who remained in Tianjin due to official business and was unable to attend, Standing Committee members Li Zeyi, Zhu Shiqin, Committee members Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, Yue Kaixian, Xu Tongxin, and Chief Secretary Wang Bihou all attended. First, Wang Bihou reported on the letters and documents received and the proposals submitted by the committee members over the past month. Then, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and Yue Kaixian reported in detail on the situations in the Ji-Mi and Luan-Yu districts, and eastern Chahar, respectively. At twelve o'clock, there was a break for lunch. The meeting continued at two o'clock in the afternoon. Due to the large number of proposals from the committee members, the agenda for this plenary session was scheduled for three days. Tomorrow (the 2nd) is a regular weekly holiday. The meeting will continue the day after tomorrow (the 3rd) and will close on the 4th. Therefore, during the meeting time this afternoon (the 1st), the committee members only selected the most important of the proposals to exchange opinions separately, and the meeting adjourned at about five o'clock. According to a committee member's statement to the reporter after the meeting, today's meeting was mainly to exchange opinions on the main issues and did not involve concrete discussions. During the three-day meeting, they planned to negotiate the most important work plan and determine the steps. Because the various clearance tasks in the war zone were related to various relevant agencies, it was necessary to complete the pre-negotiations in order to avoid temporary difficulties. According to his speculation, the work plan could be negotiated at this meeting and then submitted to Chairman Huang of the Political Reorganization Council for approval. Therefore, all issues in the war zone can be expected to be gradually cleared up in the future, and there will be no more delays. It was also learned that there are about three things that are the current priorities of the clearance work: (1) the training of security teams and police in the war zone; (2) the crackdown on Japanese and Korean ronin in the war zone; (3) the prohibition of drugs and gambling in the war zone. The quality of discipline of the security teams and police in the war zone is closely related to public security. In order to make the public security in the war zone increasingly improved, they will be trained or rectified separately. In the past, accidents in the war zone were mostly caused by Japanese and Korean ronin. In order to reduce accidents, effective measures will be taken with the Japanese side to crack down on their activities, so that they can all live in peace. Secondly, to prohibit drugs and gambling, because ordinary local thugs often collude with ronin to set up gambling dens and sell drugs in order to make petty profits. In the Tangshan area, the spread of flower clubs has been particularly widespread recently. If these two things are not prohibited, the harm will be endless. The above three things are the main points of the clearance work plan. The committee members are carefully considering the clearance methods during this meeting in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort and complete all the clearance work in the war zone within the scheduled six months.

<h3 id="e76">Chiang Sends Personnel to Supervise the Mopping-Up and Rehabilitation in Various Districts <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The District Inspectors Have Set Out to Work</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang previously divided the National Army joining the suppression of bandits into two types: attacking and mopping up. The attacking army was organized into columns, while the mopping-up areas targeted the areas occupied by the Red bandits and the areas where the bandits formed groups and their guerrilla zones. Considering the terrain of each place, they were divided into several districts, each district being responsible for more than one independent brigade, and the time limit was set to clear them up. The current operation is to facilitate the supervision of the mopping-up and the handling of rehabilitation. Each mopping-up district and attacking unit is assigned a group of bandit suppression inspectors, whose inspection and supervision tasks are as follows: (A) For those belonging to the First Department: whether the commanders at all levels are thoroughly carrying out orders, the quality of combat effectiveness of the officers and soldiers, the economic situation, and whether the management is transparent, and whether there are any malpractices in the departments at all levels. (B) For those belonging to the Second Department: (1) the situation of party and government personnel assisting the army; (2) the quality and strength of the local corps; (3) the general situation of the mass organizations; (4) all local rehabilitation matters. The inspectors for the Ganjiang and Gan-Zhe-Wan mopping-up districts have all been appointed and have set out to inspect. (November 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Ji-Mi Special Commissioner's Office Cracks Down on Illegal People's Corps in Yutian <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Wang Bingxiao Secretly Organized a People's Corps in Yutian</p>
<p>The Special Commissioner's Office Ordered the County Magistrate to Handle It Carefully</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The incompatibility between the Yutian People's Corps and the Security Supplementary Team is indeed an important issue in the war zone. Recently, Yin Rugeng and Shibayama came to Tianjin together to negotiate with Major General Umezu, Commander of the North China Japanese Garrison, hoping to obtain the Japanese side's understanding, and then the provincial authorities would implement effective handling measures. Li Zeyi also rushed here the day before yesterday to assist in the negotiations. The Japanese side believes that this matter is not only related to the North China Garrison, but must be agreed upon by the Kwantung Army before it can be expressed. It is said that Shibayama left Tianjin for Changchun last night to inquire about the Kwantung Army's opinion on behalf of our side.</p>
<p>The People's Corps occupying Ya Hongqiao is the Wang Jizong Department, about six or seven hundred people. Wang is Wang Bingxiao, who caused trouble in Yutian this spring and opened fire with the Security Team. After his department was resolved in Yanshankou this spring, he fled alone to the pseudo-state. A month ago, he suddenly received Japanese protection and returned to Yutian, claiming to be ordered by a certain party to organize the Joint People's Corps of Ji, Yu, and Bao Counties, and made himself the commander of the corps. He gathered Zhao Jingqi, Liu Zuoren, and more than a dozen others, secretly occupied the People's Corps, confiscated civilian guns, extorted money, and forced supplies. He also abolished the police stations, causing the Security Team stationed in Yutian to fear retaliation. They piled sandbags at the city gate, built trenches, and defended closely, putting Yutian in a state of anxiety. After Wang and others mixed into the police stations in various districts, the Public Security Bureau and County Magistrate Huang Zhongkai received successive reports, and the Ji-Mi Administrative Special Commissioner's Office was ordered to handle it carefully. The county issued the following announcement: [(Omission above) According to reports from the Lujiang Zhuang Branch Police Station Chief Liang Hanqing, etc., bandits are rampant and robberies occur frequently. Our station has now moved to Liuzhuangzi and merged with the newly organized People's Corps of 100 people, including Liu Zuoren, Zhang Jinqing, Tian Yunong, and Li Yanchi, in order to avoid being threatened by them. According to reports from the Second District Branch Bureau Chief Li Chongqi, the People's Corps is arrogant and has become a reality, forcing the villagers to provide soldiers and guns to increase their power. Now, the residents of various villages have fled one after another and are in dire straits. It is true that the branch police station was forced to move, and a leaflet for extortion was found, with the pseudo-corps emblem stamped on the end of the leaflet. These are submitted for investigation. The various things have been submitted to the county. After investigation, it was found that Liu Zuoren, etc., were using false pretenses, illegally organizing, not only disturbing public security, but also causing unexpected incidents. I have consulted with Guo of the Hebei Province War Zone Security Supplementary Team and telegraphed a report on the case. Now I have received a cold telegram from the Hebei Province Ji-Mi District Administrative Inspector's Office, saying, "The true telegram has been received. In addition to reporting the matter to the Provincial Government for verification, you must take cautious methods to handle it together and prevent it from spreading like wildfire, and report the handling situation at any time," etc. After investigation, it was found that Liu Zuoren, etc., had secretly organized a people's corps, disturbed the local area, and even dared to order the police station to move. They also went to various townships to confiscate civilian guns and force supplies, running rampant in the villages and ignoring the law, which is indeed unforgivable. We should strictly crack down on them to warn the failures. In addition to reporting the handling situation by special telegram, we should urgently announce to the residents of the county and others, all to know, and all to live in peace and not to listen to rumors and disturb each other. If there are lawless people who incite trouble, illegally recruit, and send rations, and do evil as bandits, they will surely be punished according to the law and will not be lenient. Be cautious and do not violate this announcement. (November 30th)]</p>
<h3 id="e78">Fujian Inspection Group's Survey of Taiwan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>丨 A Glimpse of Taiwan's Industry and Transportation 丨</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The [Taiwan Industrial Inspection Group] organized by the Fujian Provincial Government, with Chen Ticheng, Director of the Department of Construction, as the head of the group, comprising twenty-two people, departed from Fuzhou on November 13th and arrived in Taiwan on the 14th. Having completed their inspection by the 24th, they embarked on the Guangdong Maru from Keelung on the 25th, returning to Xiamen at 8:00 AM on the 26th. Wang Gupan, Director of the Special Public Security Bureau and concurrently Magistrate of Siming County, along with various agencies and groups, boarded the ship to welcome them. Tsukamoto Takeshi, the Japanese Consul stationed in Xiamen, also boarded the ship to welcome them. The entire group disembarked and stayed at the Tianxian Inn. On the 27th, they toured famous scenic spots in Xiamen and Gulangyu. On the morning of the 28th, the entire group left Xiamen for Jimei, returning to the province via land through Quanzhou and Putian.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 26th, Lu Ticheng met with visitors and discussed the itinerary, briefly stating that they departed on the 13th, spending two weeks, with a total of twelve days in Taiwan. The results of the inspection were very favorable. The agricultural and industrial areas of western Taiwan were inspected. The Governor-General's Office was extremely courteous and thorough in its hospitality. Personnel from various technical agencies were open and candid, providing meticulous guidance, making the experience very enjoyable. Taiwan's industries, especially agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, are highly developed. The most abundant industrial product is sugarcane. The Japanese have been governing Taiwan for forty years, and their construction achievements are very significant. There are three reasons for this: ㈠ Sufficient government power; the government has great authority in the colony, making it easier to implement policies and allowing everything to be done freely. ㈡ The Japanese people are very hardworking and persistent; things often fail, but they can try again and again, constantly striving, without abandoning grand plans due to minor setbacks. ㈢ Sufficient capital; investments are often in the millions. The prosperity of the entire island depends on favorable weather, geographical conditions, and human effort. Currently, the investment in Taiwan's power construction is set at 100 million, and rural water conservancy is set at 50 million. The large forests that thrive in western Taiwan today were improved and cultivated over fourteen years. Most of Taiwan's land is publicly owned. For example, in the western part of the island, government-owned forest land accounts for 80%, while private ownership only accounts for 20%. However, in recent years, due to industrial development and overproduction, it is necessary to seek outlets abroad. The nearest market is the Fujian province, which is an excellent market. Due to the economic downturn, overproduction, and tariff issues, countries are making a fuss. The United States has deeply felt this, and Japan will also feel the same way. While in Taiwan, I stated that Chinese politics are not entirely anti-foreign. In my opinion, future construction in this province does not need to imitate others in everything. We should only take their strengths and strive to move forward, so that we can use our unique features to engage in international exchange with foreign countries, to avoid the continuous increase in annual revenue and the constant outflow of national wealth. After returning to the province, I plan to carry out construction plans within our financial means. First, we will gather talent and resources, and then proceed step by step, one by one. Western Fujian is mountainous and suitable for afforestation and production, such as the Fukien fir, which has the widest range of uses. The Japanese have transplanted it in Taiwan with good results, and we should increase support to make it a special product of our province. The plains in eastern Fujian, such as Fuzhou and Xinghua, are suitable for rice cultivation. We plan to improve water conservancy and expand rice paddies. The province's insufficient rice supply is a matter of great concern. Southern Fujian, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, are abundant in sugarcane and fruits. Because of this, we should revitalize the sugar industry, and so on.</p>
<p>Inspection Schedule: November 14th, arrived in Keelung at 8:00 AM, then took a train to Taipei, staying at the Railway Hotel. In the afternoon, attended a banquet hosted by the Governor-General's Office and visited the Agricultural Specialized Department of Taipei Imperial University, the Central Research Institute, and other places. In the evening, was hosted by the Bank of Taiwan. On the 15th, visited the Central Research Forestry Department, the Commodity Exhibition Hall, the Museum, the Taipei Prefectural Industrial School, the Agricultural and Forestry Training Institute, the Xinzhuang Mandarin Orange Cultivation area, and other places. Around 10:00 PM, departed from Taipei and slept overnight in the train, arriving in Tainan the next morning. Visited the Sugar Industry Experiment Station. In the afternoon, arrived in Kaohsiung, toured the city, and visited the Pineapple Canning Inspection Office. Arrived at Cape Eluanbi in the afternoon, observing the Seedling Propagation Farm, the Forestry Experiment Station, and the Agricultural School along the way, all thoroughly inspected. On the morning of the 19th, at 11:00 AM, took a car to the Wushantou Jianan Great Irrigation Canal. There are artificial waterways and pools here, with irrigation evenly distributed, so that no water or drought disasters occur. Since its construction, agricultural production has increased threefold. For example, rice has increased by 460,000 shi per year, sugar has increased by 2.4 million dan, and total income has increased by more than 20 million yuan. The value of real estate has also increased to 95 million. On the 20th, went to Ali Mountain to visit timber collection, logging operations, and other activities, which are large in scale. On the 21st, went to Pin Yi, Water Society, and other places. On the morning of the 22nd, at 8:00 AM, visited the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant. The power plant has 100,000 kilowatts, supplying electricity to the entire city, costing 100 million yuan. Returned to Taipei at 9:00 PM that night. On the 23rd, visited the Jiaoshan Tea Factory and other places. On the 24th, went to the Colonial Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Police Officer and Prison Officer Training Center, the Monopoly Bureau, and the Slaughter Bureau for on-site inspections. On the morning of the 25th, departed from Taipei at 8:00 AM, arriving in Keelung at 9:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, boarded the Guangdong Maru. The trip lasted twelve days. Officials from the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, such as Mr. Katayose, guided the visits along the way. Overseas Chinese in various places held Chinese national flags, shouting "Long live the Republic of China!" Their warm welcome was unprecedented. Overseas Chinese federations and Good Neighborliness Associations all prepared grand banquets, demonstrating a 200,000-point enthusiasm for the motherland, which fully expresses the spirit of our Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Geography: In the 16th century, Portugal was the first to trade with our country. After Macau was ceded, Taiwan was discovered. Its English name [Formosa] is actually a Portuguese pronunciation. Our country calls it Taiwan. In 1895, after Japan annexed Taiwan, it still used our country's original name, which has not changed to this day. The area is 18,839 square miles. The population consists of 4,592,500 Taiwanese, 247,000 Japanese, and 808,000 overseas Chinese, totaling over 4.9 million people. The sea route to Xiamen is 100 miles.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Industry: Two years after Japan occupied Taiwan (1897), its imports and exports were valued at 31 million Japanese yen. By 1930, this had increased to 409.7 million Japanese yen. Agriculture is relatively developed, especially rice. The value of exports from Taiwan to Japanese-controlled territories in 1931 is listed below: Minerals: 4,597,000 Japanese yen; Marine products: 13,912,073 Japanese yen; Yellow Plums: 4,158,000 Japanese yen; Straw hats: 3,838,000 Japanese yen; Sugar: 123,832,000 Japanese yen; Rice: 41,067,000 Japanese yen; Tea: 7,363,000 Japanese yen; Camphor: 2,352,000 Japanese yen; Bananas: 8,329,000 Japanese yen. The total exports for that year, including the above, were valued at 220,873,000 Japanese yen. Imports were 145,622,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Transportation: The government-owned railway has increased to 563 miles, and the commercially owned railway has increased to 1,349 miles. Most of the commercial railways were funded by sugar merchants to transport raw materials or for sugar factory exports. The telephone business is completely government-owned. When it opened in 1900, there were only five exchanges and 431 users. Progress has been made over the years. By the winter of 1933, there were 112 exchanges and 15,700 users, with a total income of approximately 2,712,000 Japanese yen. Japanese users account for approximately 71%, and Taiwanese users account for 29%. Long-distance telephones are readily available, and there are almost none without them in cities, towns, and villages. Takao (i.e., Kaohsiung Prefecture), located at the mouth of the sea, is an important port for foreign trade. In 1932, a new telephone bureau valued at 440,000 Japanese yen was completed there. Because the location is in the tropics, air conditioning is specially installed in the building to keep the room temperature below 75 degrees Celsius all day long. Currently, the bureau has 1,200 automatic telephone users, with an ultimate capacity of 4,800 users. The Takao automatic telephone needs to be specially mentioned because the equipment is manufactured locally in Japan, while other places use equipment manufactured in Europe and the United States. As for long-distance telephone calls to Japan proper, they have already been established in April of this year, through government-business cooperation, with a capital of 10 million Japanese yen. In addition to communication between Taiwan and Japan, there are also plans to connect with countries in Europe, America, and Asia. (November 30th)</p>

Yu Ming, Director of the Diplomatic Ministry's Office, and leaders from Chinese and foreign communities were invited to accompany them. The guests and hosts had a very pleasant conversation, and the party ended at about 9:00 PM. According to the Vice President of Nicaragua, he was very grateful for the warm reception given by the Chinese government and people during his visit to China. He had a very good impression of his trip from Shanghai to Nanjing and from Nanjing to Beiping, and deeply felt that China is a peace-loving, honest, hardworking, and resilient nation. The vitality of the youth and the efforts of construction in various places prove that China has a great and bright future, and the beauty of the scenic spots and historical sites in Beiping is unforgettable. Regarding the signing of the Sino-Nicaraguan Commercial Treaty, it has been fully negotiated with the Chinese government, and after he returns to his country in February next year and submits it to the government for approval, it can be formally signed. This is a satisfying result of the visit to China. It is reported that Mr. Ai has decided to take the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru tomorrow to leave Shanghai and continue to visit various countries in Europe, and is scheduled to return to his country in February next spring.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Foreign Call Loan Rate Dropped to Twenty Cents</p>
<p>The Shanghai market's need for cash has been increasing daily, leading to an unusually tight money market and soaring foreign call loan rates. It is now heard that the outflow of cash has decreased sharply in recent days, resulting in a gradual easing of the money market. In the money market yesterday morning, the foreign call loan rates opened at 8:30 AM and 12:30 PM, both having dropped to twenty cents, a decrease of fifteen cents compared to yesterday and a decrease of twenty cents compared to the highest point. The discount on head money was twenty-five cents. According to people in the money market, the money market is gradually loosening, and the foreign call loan rate is feared to drop again.</p>

<p>Due to an Obstruction with the Official Special Train at Zhenru Station</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, an official empty special train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, intended to depart from Nanxiang for Shanghai, suddenly stopped a few miles from Zhenru Station. The outer steel wheel axle screw of the locomotive C-16 pulling the train had suddenly loosened, causing it to stop and unable to move forward. Railway staff immediately reported to Zhenru Station, which urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Main Station. At the same time, Nanxiang Station was telegraphed to pay attention to incoming trains from Beijing to Shanghai, to avoid accidents. Upon receiving the news, the Main Station immediately dispatched a repair train to carry out repairs. It was not until 7:05 PM that the repairs were completed, and the train was able to depart for Shanghai. The Shanghai-Beiping through train was delayed for three hours as a result, before it could depart.</p>

<p>The Changxing Steamer Received a Call Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Call Sign Was Received but No Further Information Followed</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Sanbei Steamship Company's Taishan steamer, which went missing on the 27th of last month after loading three thousand tons of coal in Qingdao and sailing to Shanghai, has had its ship number called out by coastal radio stations and the company's Ningxing and other steamers along the coast, but there has been no response. The company has dispatched the Hengshan steamer, sailing from Qingdao to Shanghai, to search along the way. According to Guo Wen News Agency, the missing Taishan steamer of the Sanbei Company was hailed by the company's Changxing steamer, which was berthed at the Muddy Ferry in Pudong, via radio at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. A call sign of XNDF was immediately received, seemingly sent by the Taishan steamer. However, because the ship's radio had been damaged, it was not possible to clearly understand its location and the reason for its disappearance. Although the Changxing steamer continued to transmit calls yesterday, no further information or details have been received.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Special Survey Record of Domestic Goods Industry <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(10) Thermos Bottle Industry</p>
<p>Thermos bottles used to be imported goods. The first domestic manufacturer to start this emerging industry was the Guangming Thermos Bottle Factory ten years ago. Afterwards, Lixing, Han Chang, Zhonghua, Samsung, Guangda, Zhenye, Tongchang, Far East, and other factories were established one after another. They flourished and became very popular for a time. At most, there were more than sixty companies. In the past two years, competition has intensified, and the number of factories has been too large, which has led to an oversupply. The industry is declining. Although the amount of foreign goods has decreased, domestic goods have not been selling well, which is a hidden concern for the industry's future. Recently, our reporter interviewed Gan Dounan, the chairman of the Thermos Bottle Trade Association and manager of Lixing Thermos Bottle Factory, Liang Bozhi, manager of Guangming Thermos Bottle Factory, and Wang Zhizhang, manager of Danhua Thermos Bottle Factory, who provided detailed information and gave many suggestions. The following is a record of what was said. There are currently twenty thermos bottle companies, and fourteen of them are members of the trade association. There are two companies that make bottle cores. The annual sales of domestic products are about 2.5 million yuan. The annual business of large factories such as Guangming and Lixing is about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Regarding the purchase of raw materials, imported goods such as tinplate and glass sand account for about 40%. Domestic paint can also be used. In terms of labor, many people used to borrow talent from Japan, but recently there have been more and more domestic skilled workers. However, wages are very high, and factories poach workers from each other. The most difficult aspect of production and sales is extending credit to customers. If you are not careful, you will get bad debts. There are no particular difficulties in sales in China. In Hong Kong, due to price relations, they cannot compete with the strong sales of Japanese goods. Currently, the factories that have failed in the industry, such as Lizhong, Guanghua, Shanghai, China, and Yutai, have either stopped working or are in the process of liquidation. The most significant reason for their failure is short capital (small factories in the industry can be established with a capital of 2,000 yuan), and poor technology and shoddy workmanship are also fatal wounds. According to Gan, the thermos bottle industry used to be dominated by foreign goods. Eastern goods had annual sales of 2.7 to 8 million yuan, and Western goods had annual sales of over 1 million yuan. Recently, there have been more and more domestic goods, and Eastern goods are now less than 1 million yuan per year, and Western goods are only 500,000 yuan. It cannot be said that the Chinese people have not worked hard to promote domestic goods, nor can it be said that they have been ineffective. If this industry can cooperate with each other, it will not only have great development but can also be sold overseas. However, there are still many Japanese goods in Tianjin, the Yangtze River area, and the countryside is declining. The purchasing power of the general public is far worse than before. The products of various factories are feeling sluggish, and the price of goods this year has been reduced by 30% compared to last year. According to the opinions of Gan, Liang, and Wang, at present, only the industry can realize, cooperate with each other, and be determined to compete with foreigners. They should not be at odds with each other in China. The first solution is to have excellent products, the second is to have low costs, and the third is to make more patterns. If they can make cheap and good products, why worry about not being able to drive out foreign goods? The leaders of each factory should especially adopt a steady and forward-looking approach, research and create special products, and strive for mass production, maintain industry relations, and strive for overseas markets. Then, the difficult thermos bottle industry may have hope for development. This lies in the thorough awakening and sincere cooperation among the industry. It is vaguely heard that some vendors are ordering brands from Japanese factories, and some small factories are specializing in selling inferior goods, changing their appearance to deceive people, causing domestic manufacturers to suffer. This is something that the industry should have a way to sanction.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy and Director of Jiangnan Shipyard, has recently found his ministerial duties increasingly busy. The business of Jiangnan Shipyard is also extremely important, and he fears that his concurrent positions may lead to mistakes. He has specially submitted a resignation to the government to resign from his concurrent position as Director of Jiangnan Shipyard. This resignation was submitted by Chen Zaofan, the deputy director, some time ago. It is now known that the government has approved his request and ordered Ma Deji, the former director of Jiangnan Shipyard, to take over the position. Ma is currently the director of the Fujian Province Pilotage Bureau. After receiving the appointment, Ma has resigned from his position in the Fujian provincial government and come to Shanghai. Yesterday, Ma went to see Chen at the HSBC Building to ask for instructions on the direction to be taken after taking over, and it was agreed that he would go to the shipyard to take up his new post within the week.</p>

<p>His Blood Pressure Was as High as 187</p>
<p>It is Undecided Whether He Will Attend the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Li Liejun, a member of the Central Executive Committee and the National Government Committee, went to Lushan this summer to escape the heat. He then went down the mountain due to illness and returned to his hometown of Wuning to recuperate for several months. It is now learned that Mr. Li left Wuning last week with his secretary Zhang Bigong and others, went to Jiujiang, and transferred to the Yihua Company's Gonghe steamer to return to Shanghai. He arrived at the port at 11:30 AM yesterday. Xu Yuangao, a member of the Legislative Yuan, Tao Jiayao, the former governor of Jiangxi Province, Wang Zhinan, the secretary of the city's security office, Dai Enji, the manager of China Aviation Corporation, and Mrs. Li and many others went to the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Li returned to his residence with his wife and secretary to rest. Regarding the matter of attending the Fifth Plenary Session, according to Mr. Li's conversation with a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, he had been recuperating from his old illness for quite some time in the countryside, and the supply of medicine and other supplies in the countryside was not as convenient as in Shanghai, and his blood pressure had increased compared to before. When he was examined by a doctor in Jiujiang the day before yesterday, it was 187, so he returned to Shanghai to recuperate. The Fifth Plenary Session is approaching, but he has no preparations for proposals, and it is difficult to determine whether he will attend due to his illness. He had not seen the telegrams of Wang and Jiang, so he did not know about them. He only heard about Wang Liangchou and others going to Hong Kong when he passed through Nanjing the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Chinese and Foreign Rice Merchants Purchasing a Large Batch of Foreign Rice <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 500,000 Dan</p>
<p>It Can Be Shipped to Shanghai Within This Month</p>
<p>This year, China has been plagued by floods and droughts, and the harvest in rural areas has been exhausted. The issue of people's food is gradually becoming serious, and all parties are paying close attention to it. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency specially visited Gu Xinyi, a leader in the local grain business, yesterday. According to him, he discussed the issue of grain in great detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Provinces with Poor Harvests Purchasing from Shanghai According to Mr. Gu, food is one of the most important factors in people's lives, clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and disasters occur frequently, even the provinces that produce the most rice, such as Anhui, are only sufficient to feed themselves. This has led to a serious problem of people's food, and the people themselves feel uneasy. Fortunately, the authorities of various provinces have responded quickly and handled the situation properly, so there is no need to worry. However, according to what I know, the most serious disaster this time is Zhejiang Province. The province's rice production has always been abundant, but this year it is purchasing grain in large quantities from Shanghai for use. The rest of the provinces such as Lu, Ji, and Su have also experienced poor harvests.</p>
<p>Purchasing Foreign Rice to Regulate People's Food The local authorities in Shanghai, in view of the importance of the grain issue, and Shanghai being the hub of transportation for various provinces, specially ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to convene grain merchants to discuss relief measures. It was then decided to purchase foreign rice to regulate people's food. Today, the grain merchants are still able to comply with the price limit set by the Social Affairs Bureau, which is due to the efforts of the local authorities in Shanghai. According to another source, Mr. Gu, in conjunction with major local grain merchants, has ordered 200,000 dan of foreign rice from Annam, and foreign merchants have also ordered as much as 300,000 dan, all of which can be shipped to Shanghai within this month. It is also learned that foreign merchants have already chartered Norwegian ships to transport them to China.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Chen Kecheng on the Current Disaster Relief Problem <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>China is afflicted by heavenly disaster; calamities strike year after year. First, there was the devastating flood of the 20th year of the Republic, followed by the unprecedented national crisis. Just as the people of the nation were struggling with internal and external troubles, a sudden drought struck, impossible to stop, turning vast stretches of land into red earth, fields cracking, leaving the moribund rural economy to declare its final collapse. According to the previous report of the Relief Committee, this year's drought-stricken provinces number eleven, with the stricken counties reaching 263. In terms of farmland area, even the fertile Jiangsu Province has a staggering 35.75 million mu. Other provinces, uninvestigated areas, and regions affected by floods and insect plagues are beyond count. Given the poverty of our nation's economic foundation and the fragility of its social structure, the Yellow Terrace's melons cannot withstand repeated plucking. Yet, disaster repeatedly strikes, driving us to the brink of ruin. Is Heaven truly abandoning us, or is this a cause for deep sorrow?</p>
<p>The affected area this time is so vast, and the degree of suffering so profound. A picture of disaster victims fleeing, selling wives and children in misery, is beyond our comprehension. It is even more impossible for those in urban comfort and ease to imagine. In the blink of an eye, winter will arrive, and the disaster victims will have no clothes to cover themselves, no food to fill their bellies, howling in the wilderness, shivering and awaiting death. Who does not have parents? Who does not have children? Considering their situation, no one can be unfeeling. Therefore, those who have not suffered should, in good conscience, act with sincerity and provide assistance. Now, each province is discussing winter defense, seeking to protect the people. However, those who commit crimes and threaten winter defense are mostly driven by hunger and cold, unwilling to perish in a ditch. The ancient philosophers had a saying: "With full granaries, people know etiquette and shame." The common people seek only to live. If there is no way to live, they will not hesitate to use any means. It is not their fault that they resort to desperate measures; it is the environment that drives them. Their actions are pitiable, and their situation is understandable. Therefore, if we want to achieve social order and stability and quell banditry, we must first address the problem of comforting the disaster victims. Furthermore, when it comes to plotting resistance against aggression and striving for survival, it is impossible to save the nation without stabilizing the people's lives and strengthening their power. If China is as it is today, with cries of misery everywhere, it will become a breeding ground for bandits and a source of chaos, leaving us unable to focus on domestic issues and without the means to resist foreign aggression. This is a matter of national consciousness that should be addressed urgently and made a priority.</p>
<p>In the matter of disaster relief, the central government has been actively planning, but given the current depletion of the treasury, the enormity of expenses, and the immense need for disaster relief, it relies on the generous assistance of our compatriots. The recent mass donation campaign initiated by Mayor Wu and others in Shanghai is intended to awaken the attention of Shanghai citizens and lead them to open their purses and rescue those in distress. Now that the association has officially begun its work and is meticulously planning various projects, we firmly believe that the results will be remarkable, given Shanghai's past enthusiasm for disaster relief donations, which has been followed by major cities across the country. With the mayor's call to action, we are confident that the results will be impressive. However, as this major fundraising effort begins, we have one more thing to say: we hope that citizens will deeply understand the profound meaning of this initiative by the organizers and donate generously, providing timely assistance. Those who are involved in the process should ensure that the procedures are clearer and the credit is more established. We hear that more than a dozen groups are participating in this fundraising effort, so the procedures for collecting and disbursing funds must be strictly regulated to avoid criticism and ensure that every penny is used effectively, so that the organizers' grand vision is not in vain and the efficiency of disaster relief is enhanced. After mentioning the importance of disaster relief, we wish to express our sincere hope!</p>

<h3 id="e107">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Representatives to Petition for Prompt Change to Brokerage Tax <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>And Requests Suspension of Enforcement Before the Measures Are Announced</p>
<p>After the Municipal Finance Bureau implemented the new brokerage tax regulations, various industry associations believed that they were difficult to implement and had repeatedly submitted petitions through the Chamber of Commerce to the Municipal Government to request a reduction. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has reported that the Finance Bureau, before resolving the disputes over the new brokerage tax regulations, immediately dispatched police to demand payment, causing great panic among the brokerage merchants in various industries. The association has specially sent Pan Xusheng, director of the General Affairs Department, and Xin Dingshan, a representative of the Coal and Charcoal Industry Association, to the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM yesterday to urge the prompt announcement of the revised measures for the brokerage tax and the temporary suspension of enforcement before the measures are announced. The original text is recorded as follows: Submission for Petition. On the first day of this month, we received a letter from the Coal and Charcoal Industry Association stating that, "According to our members Xieji, Wang Changji, Tongyu, and other firms, representatives came to the association to complain, 'To whom it may concern: Our members Xieji, Wang Changji, Tongyu, and other firms, representatives came to the association to complain that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has dispatched police to our firms to order us to fill out the application forms and guarantee forms newly issued by the Finance Bureau within three days and apply for new licenses from the South Municipal Taxation Office ourselves. We have been applying for new licenses from the brokerage tax collection office through your association without interruption or concealment since our firms were established. This year, due to the new regulations issued by the Municipal Finance Bureau, which are difficult to implement, and the taxation office's refusal to grant the issuance of new licenses according to past practice, we have been unable to comply. At the same time, your association contacted various brokerage industry associations to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to argue on the basis of reason and sent representatives to the Municipal Government to petition. Now, the Finance Bureau is dispatching police to demand payment without waiting for the Municipal Government to resolve the matter. Such a situation is making it impossible for merchants to comply. Therefore, we urge your association to promptly remedy the situation to reassure the business community.' This association has repeatedly requested your association to find a way to provide relief since the Municipal Finance Bureau issued the new regulations, and sent representatives to the Municipal Government to petition and submitted an outline for your association to forward. Now that the Finance Bureau is dispatching police to demand payment while the Municipal Government is carefully considering the matter and merchants are waiting for a solution, such a situation seems like oppression. We are sending a letter and asking Xin Dingsan to go to your association to explain everything. We respectfully request that you send representatives to the Municipal Government to argue again that this case should not be implemented until it is resolved and order the Public Security Bureau to suspend enforcement to avoid causing panic among merchants and creating major disputes." The association has received letters from various industries related to the brokerage tax, stating that the new regulations restrict brokerage commissions and are very different from the actual business situation. If implemented, no brokerage firm can survive. We requested that you forward it to the Municipal Government for review and revision on October 13th, detailing the reasons. Afterwards, various industries sent explanations, which were sent to the Secretariat of the Municipal Government for review. The difficulties of various industries and the necessity of revising the new regulations must be clear. On November 3rd, various industries urged us to submit another petition to your government, requesting that you inform the Finance Bureau to temporarily suspend the implementation of the new regulations before they are revised, and to temporarily suspend the renewal of expired brokerage licenses. It has been more than a month, and we have not received a response. However, the Finance Bureau has suddenly rigorously implemented the new regulations and dispatched police to demand payment, ignoring the previous requests of the merchants. Various industries are extremely worried and unable to remain silent. They have submitted another petition to Pan Xusheng, director of the General Affairs Department, to present the previous situation to your government, requesting that you promptly announce the revised measures for the brokerage tax and temporarily suspend the renewal of expired licenses until the new measures are announced, in order to appease the hopes of the merchants. It is for the public benefit. We respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<h3 id="e114">The Association of Industry and Commerce Management Will Attend the International Scientific Management Conference <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth International Scientific Management Conference is scheduled to be held in London next July, from the 15th to the 20th of July, at Hampton Court Palace. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has agreed to lend his support and will personally preside over the opening ceremony. It is estimated that over 2,000 representatives from various countries will attend, all of whom will be hosted by the London Municipal Government. The conference content is divided into six major groups: 1. Manufacturing, 2. Agriculture, 3. Sales, 4. Education and Training, 5. Development, and 6. Industrial Science. The Shanghai Chinese Association of Industry and Commerce Management has received a letter from the conference organizing committee inviting it to participate. According to the person in charge of the association, the importance of this conference is no less than that of the Pacific International Academic Conference. As the representative organization for Chinese researchers in management science, the association should urgently send representatives to participate and report on the progress of the scientific management movement in China in recent years, in order to preserve China's image in the international arena. However, the round-trip travel expenses for the representatives are substantial, and the association's finances are difficult to bear. It is currently seeking to raise funds and requesting government subsidies. If it is impossible to do so, it will petition the government to instruct the embassy in London to send representatives to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Popularization Plan for the Rose Garden New Village is Progressing Rapidly <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Thirty people have signed up to build houses in five days.</p>
<p>Intends to complete it simultaneously with the first phase of the plan.</p>
<p>The Rose Garden New Village, created by the China New Village Construction Society, is scheduled to begin construction on the 10th of this month and be completed by August of next year. The groundbreaking ceremony was originally scheduled for the 9th of this month. However, since the New Village Civic Hall is scheduled to lay its foundation stone and begin construction next spring, a grand groundbreaking ceremony must be held at that time. Therefore, the groundbreaking ceremony has been suspended. The Society's creation of the Rose Garden New Village aims to selectively adopt</p>
<p>the form of British Garden Cities, while incorporating the meaning of Japanese New Villages, to improve Chinese social life. It is not only to solve the housing problem for society. Since the announcement of the second phase of the popularization plan, it has aroused the attention of people from all walks of life. The Society hopes that the benefits of the New Village can be extended to society, so it strives to make the price and construction methods of this plan suitable for the economic capacity of the general public. Therefore, those from all walks of life who</p>
<p>love New Village life are competing to sign up. In just five days since the announcement of the plan, 30 households have been confirmed. Their names are as follows: ·Tang Youwei, ·Zhang Wenxiang, ·Shi Hanzhang, ·Xi Zhongfu, ·Fang Jiaobo, ·He Chenxun, ·Ding Ziren, ·Li Zhilun, ·Ding Huiyuan, ·Yu Tiansheng, ·Ding Hesheng, ·Sheng Ruinian, ·Hu Xiyuan, ·Ji Kaixian, ·Yang Jusheng, ·Zhang Fulai, ·Zhao Wenqi, ·Li Jiaxiang, ·Zhang Wenjie, ·Zhang Hongqing, ·Bao Dachuan, ·Sun Guohui, ·Wang Jinwen, ·Li Wen, ·Lu Peihang, ·Wu Yunru, ·Luo Fang, ·Chen Huang, ·Li Guoying, ·Yang Muhan, ·Shen Yunduo, ·Liu Jing. The Society's popularization plan aims to</p>
<p>enable the propertyless to own property. The method it has created, of obtaining ownership of real estate upon the expiration of a fixed-term lease, aims to save the infinite consumption of households in the city and reform the indefinite lease system. It strives to enable households to turn consumption into growth, obtain comfortable housing, a beautiful environment, realize a happy life, and establish a healthy family. It is no wonder that it has been praised by people from all walks of life. The Society wants to build this plan simultaneously with the first phase of the plan,</p>
<p>to complete the ideal New Village, so the solicitation for signing up will end at the end of this year. It is heard that this plan is limited to only one hundred houses, which is inevitably insufficient to meet the demand. Those who feel the seriousness of the urban housing problem and abhor the boredom of urban life should pay close attention to it. The Society has various charts and house models available for viewing by people from all walks of life. The Society's address is 918 Edward Road (opposite the Nanjing Grand Theater).</p>

<p>Zao Zhaoyu, a native of Ningbo, sneaked into Tianbaocheng Gold Shop at 615 East Seward Road at 2:50 PM on the 23rd of last month. Under the pretext of exchanging gold rings, he forcibly took them and escaped. Shi Yonglun, a shop assistant, jumped out of the counter and chased him frantically, shouting "Catch the thief!" He was intercepted by Hua Detective You Youming, who brought him and the stolen goods to the Huishan Police Station, and then escorted him to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiexuan came to the court for a further hearing. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that no other cases had been found during the period of adjournment. He requested that the defendant's confession be investigated. The defendant confessed that he had resorted to this scheme because he was poor and unable to make a living. He pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao sentenced Zao Zhaoyu to two months' imprisonment and ordered that the stolen goods be returned to their original owner.</p>

<p>Cheng Jiang is dissatisfied and must appeal</p>
<p>Cheng Zhong'an, a native of Sichuan, was a sundry goods broker who traveled between Shanghai, Beiping, and other places. He was skilled in business and accumulated a considerable fortune. In March of this year, Cheng Zhong'an went to Beiping to do business and unfortunately died of illness. When the bad news came, Jiang Yueying (i.e., Cheng Jiang), a woman from Songjiang, and Li Abao (i.e., Cheng Li), a local woman, filed lawsuits in the local court one after another over the issue of status, demanding to be recognized as Cheng Zhong'an's wife. They also slandered each other, accusing the other party of being a concubine, while claiming to be Cheng Zhong'an's formal wife. Because the case was unusually complicated, the court spared no effort to seek details, repeatedly ordering the matchmakers and witnesses presented by both sides to appear in court to describe the past events and the marriage situation. It is learned that this case has been debated to a conclusion and the judgment has been announced the day before yesterday: (Main Text) Cheng Jiang's lawsuit is dismissed; Cheng Li is recognized as the wife of the deceased Cheng Zhong'an. The verdicts have already been served separately. It is heard that Cheng Jiang is dissatisfied with the verdict and will appeal according to law.</p>

<p>Tong Gaofeng, a native of Shaoxing, 49 years old this year, was engaged in the business of foreign socks in Shanghai. Recently, for some unknown reason, he suddenly had a pessimistic idea. One night, he bought raw opium and went to the Xinquanxing Inn at 398 Minquan Road in the French Concession, booking room number three to stay overnight. He committed suicide by swallowing poison that night. At 9 AM yesterday morning, Zhou Xingyu, a waiter, urged him to get up but received no response. When he entered the room to check, he saw that Tong's face was pale and he could not open his mouth. Knowing that he had committed suicide by taking poison, he immediately reported it to the Innkeepers' Association, which sent someone to check and then reported it to the French Concession Police. A detective was dispatched to investigate. At noon, he was taken to Renji Hospital, but he had been poisoned too deeply and could not be saved. He died at 1:30 PM. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. Since there was no household registration, the Special Second Court will be requested to send someone to examine the body this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Lecture by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Over 8,000 Attendees Listening to Lecture and Touring Exhibition</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the exhibit</p>
<p>The Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Achievement Exhibition was held yesterday, the second day. Since it was a Sunday and there were celebrity lectures, the number of attendees viewing the displays and listening to the lectures was even greater than on the first day. Many schools and organizations also participated. The City Chamber of Commerce's assembly hall and the display rooms on the third floor were overcrowded, and many people had to leave. Throughout the day, over 8,000 people viewed the displays and listened to the lectures. At 10 AM, the lecture meeting began. First, Mr. Wang Yansong delivered the opening remarks, followed by Mr. Xu Yongzuo's report on the process and opinions regarding the improvement of Chinese bookkeeping. The celebrities who gave lectures included prominent figures in the business community, such as Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, and Luo Qinghua, as well as Lin Jinyu, the Director of the Nanjing Audit Department. Other notable figures, such as Yu Zuoting, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Xu Jipin, a standing committee member, Wen Yiyou, the Director of the Accounting Bureau of the National Government's Accounting Office, as well as Pan Yangyao, Sheng Zhuo'er, Ji Jiannan, and Tao Leqin, were also prepared to give lectures, but were unable to do so due to the lateness of the hour. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Order 1. Ringing the bell to open the meeting; 2. All stand at attention and pay the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the Portrait of the Premier; 3. Reverently read the Premier's Will; 4. Mr. Wang Yansong delivers the opening remarks; 5. Mr. Xu Yongzuo reports on the process of improving Chinese bookkeeping; 6. Celebrity lectures; 7. Ringing the bell to adjourn the meeting.</p>
<p>Opening Remarks First, Mr. Wang Yansong delivered the opening remarks, stating briefly that accounting is closely related to industry and commerce, and the City Chamber of Commerce is responsible for promoting industry and commerce. It has always attached importance to various matters related to industrial and commercial management, and accounting is one aspect of it. It is well known that bookkeeping in our country is poor, and the City Chamber of Commerce deeply felt the need to improve it. Accountant Xu Yongzuo also felt the same way, so he jointly organized an improved Chinese bookkeeping training course this year. The first cohort has now graduated, and they should make a significant contribution to the industrial and commercial community. He hopes that the graduates will continue to work hard in the future to promote and develop the improved Chinese bookkeeping method, and use their learning to engage in the actual work of improvement, so that the general industrial and commercial community can benefit from it. Bookkeeping in our country has a long history, and it has many advantages, but unfortunately, it has always been thought of as something that ordinary people could learn, leading to disorder and uncertainty, which greatly hinders industrial and commercial management. Since Western bookkeeping was introduced to China, although it seems to be orderly, the principles are complex and the costs are high, and the bookkeeping talent cannot be achieved in a short-term training program. It is not easy to promote to the general bookkeeping community, so the Chinese and Western methods have never been communicated. Those who use the Chinese method do not know the scientific methods of the Western method, and those who use the Western method do not understand the habits of the Chinese method. We want to find a moderate and easy method, and we can only adopt the improved Chinese bookkeeping method. We can only promote the improved Chinese bookkeeping method. The students of the training course should be aware of the importance of their mission. Please, all of you celebrities present, give us more advice to supplement what the training has not covered.</p>
<p>Report on the Process Next, Accountant Xu Yongzuo reported, stating briefly that since the introduction of Western bookkeeping to China, Chinese bookkeeping has been despised by people for a long time. However, for the past three or four decades, except for banks, railways, and new enterprises, Chinese bookkeeping has been as prevalent as ever, and its simplicity and incompleteness have remained the same. Remaining in this state for a long time has a huge impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Although I am trained in Western bookkeeping, in the past ten years, I have felt that Western bookkeeping is not easy to promote, and Chinese bookkeeping is difficult to abandon. I advocate guiding the situation and improving Chinese bookkeeping. Since the publication of the improved Chinese bookkeeping plan and special book last winter, it has aroused the attention of the whole country. Last winter, we held an exhibition and lecture meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce, and at that time, many listeners requested to run a training course, but it did not happen due to being busy. Since the beginning of this year, more and more people have adopted the improved Chinese bookkeeping method, and more and more people have requested to run a training course. Therefore, I discussed the charter with Mr. Yan, the Principal of the Commercial School of the City Chamber of Commerce, and started this subject. Since publishing the announcement in the newspaper in late July, more than 800 people have come to study in less than ten days. Because the classroom could no longer accommodate them, we had to stop enrolling early and started school on August 1st. We taught for one hour a day, and it was completed in two months. Although the time was short, the students were able to study hard, so the results were still good. I would also like to ask all of you present to give us more guidance.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Speech Briefly stated that I am a very old-fashioned person, and I have not studied either Chinese bookkeeping or Western bookkeeping. However, I feel that the Chinese and Western methods each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and each has its own applicable place. The adoption should be based on one's own circumstances, and it is not necessary to adopt the Western method to be considered new. It is also not necessary to think that you have completely learned something. Accountant Xu Yongzuo's improved Chinese bookkeeping extracts the scientific spirit of the Western method and integrates it, and uses the inherent habits of the Chinese method and improves them. Integration and understanding is easy to implement. Although I am an old-fashioned person, I also feel that it is very perfect and quite commendable. Some people measure the merits of Chinese and Western methods by the distinction between horizontal and vertical formats. I think it is unnecessary, because horizontal and vertical formats have their own considerable value in themselves. However, we have always read books in a vertical format and written in a vertical format, so we feel that the vertical format of Chinese bookkeeping is more practical. Now that we are promoting a new life, everyone is paying attention to it. In fact, the goal of the new life is to restore the old morality. For Western bookkeepers, it is not impossible to view talking about improving Chinese bookkeeping in this way. Others may judge the application of Chinese and Western methods by the difference between new and old businesses. I think the views should be far-reaching. How broad is the situation in China that is suitable for the Chinese method? It is not possible to limit it to several urban foreign-style organizations. Accountant Xu is an old friend of mine. Although I do not understand the mysteries of bookkeeping, I feel that his improved Chinese bookkeeping is both understandable and feasible. Please, everyone, jointly promote it.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech Briefly stated that we should reform everything that we feel is not applicable or does not meet the needs of the times. The so-called reformers are not intended to stick to the old methods, nor are they intended to imitate foreign countries. For example, if bookkeeping continues to use the inherent methods without change, it is conservatism. If it completely adopts Western methods, it is imitation. Neither is right. We must retain the strengths of the inherent methods and remove the shortcomings in order to be called reform. However, there is a distinction between improving and worsening reform. It must be changed for the better in order to be practical. If it is changed for the worse, it is better not to change it. Accountant Xu Yongzuo's improved Chinese bookkeeping is a change for the better. We only ask whether the reform is appropriate, and we can ignore how it is done.</p>
<p>Lin Jinyu's Speech Briefly stated that I have several thoughts on the improved Chinese bookkeeping method: 1. The general public regards accounting as a minor skill. Scholars and officials are ashamed to talk about goods and profits. The economic difficulties of China's public and private sectors are not unrelated to this. Since I went abroad to study until now, I have never left the accounting field. I have found that the importance of accounting is beyond what the general public imagines. However, I have not seen many people in the country who can deeply pay attention to this and preside over the meeting to seek universal improvement. Now I am fortunate that Accountant Xu is promoting the reform of our country's inherent Chinese bookkeeping method. How happy I am to come all the way from Nanjing to participate in this grand event. 2. Theory and practice cannot be neglected. Chinese and Western bookkeeping methods each have their own strengths in theory, but in practice, we should consider which one to adopt. As far as the present is concerned, the use of the improved Chinese bookkeeping method should be more common in various parts of China. This cannot be denied. Some say that the development of industry comes from need, and if Western bookkeeping is popular, China will be able to produce its own pens, ink, paper, and Zhangzi. There is a reasonable point in this statement, but it cannot be said for the time being. In my opinion, the principle is that science is suitable for the times. In the future, horizontal accounts can be improved with the Chinese bookkeeping method, and there is a possibility of gradually becoming horizontal. I saw a lot of things on display at the exhibition. Among the accounts, there is a horizontal daily nuclear table. Is this the beginning? Based on these two thoughts, I feel that when talking about improving Chinese bookkeeping, we should take into account all the problems. It would be more appropriate to name it improving Chinese Bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Qin Runqing's Speech Briefly stated that merchants, whether large or small, have their own books and records. The profits and losses of the business and the verification of debts depend on the accounts. The accounts of our merchants in various industries are different, lack a system, follow the old customs, and are unwilling to change. Although detailed notes are rarely clear, there are still many shortcomings in this. Recently, the European wind has been blowing eastward, and the Western method is popular. Although the bookkeeping continuation is complicated, the records are more detailed than the Chinese method. Now Accountant Xu has initiated the improvement of Chinese bookkeeping and set up a school to teach. The scholars from all over the country are very enthusiastic, which shows the importance of this matter. Moreover, the Chinese bookkeeping method has been simplified, summarized, and improved by Accountant Xu, and has become a model bookkeeping method with clear items and practical use. In the future, if it can be gradually promoted throughout the country and adopted uniformly, it will be a great celebration for the industrial and commercial circles of our country.</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua's Speech Briefly stated that bookkeeping is a kind of social science, and it should be rationalized. The so-called rationalization is to fully exert its "efficiency." The so-called "efficiency" includes three major elements: 1. Accuracy, 2. Simplicity, and 3. Savings. Now, let's talk about the ability of the Chinese and Western bookkeeping methods to meet the conditions of "efficiency." The simplicity and obviousness of Chinese bookkeeping and the saving of expenses are indeed beyond the reach of Western bookkeeping. However, its shortcomings are that the accounts have no fixed format, the accounts have no fixed classification, and the bookkeeping has no fixed rules. In short, it does not meet the principle of accuracy. Western bookkeeping is accurate, but simplicity and saving are not necessary. Therefore, speaking of improving bookkeeping, it is better to take the strengths of the Western method and make up for the shortcomings of the Chinese method. Accountant Xu's improved Chinese bookkeeping is able to meet this principle. All of our Chinese people should unanimously approve and cooperate to promote it. Finally, there is also a report, that is, I recently participated in the meeting of the Legislative Yuan and discussed the Commercial Registration Law. In view of the fact that China's bookkeeping law has not yet been perfected, and the Western bookkeeping law cannot be practical, I advocated that the improved Chinese bookkeeping method should be incorporated into the code after it has been effectively promoted. It can be seen that the improved Chinese bookkeeping method is not only valued by the business community, but also known by the government.</p>

<p>Purpose: First, Li Manyun, one of the founders of the group, reported on the preparation process and organizational details, stating that the group was formed in view of the recent influx of foreign goods into the market and the daily decline of domestic products, resulting in a severe loss of rights and profits. The outflow of wealth is deeply regrettable. The way to remedy this is to improve domestic products, expand promotion, and create a widespread and deep impression of domestic products among the people, so that domestic products can flourish. However, many young people admire foreign things and willingly become salesmen for foreign goods. Even those who serve in the domestic products industry spend their leisure time in dance halls or pursuing music and entertainment, squandering their useful energy in a world of pleasure, and their ambitions are worn down, which is truly heartbreaking. This is why we use our spare time to organize the Amateur Performance Troupe. Although the group has only been initiated for a short time, many ambitious young people have come to participate upon hearing the news, which shows that the people are not dead and the country has great potential. Currently, in addition to using No. 407, Central China Building as the group's address, the first preparatory meeting was held the day before yesterday to discuss the matters to be carried out. At the same time, we will submit the application to the city's party and government agencies for filing, and separately solicit members, in order to promote domestic products and achieve the goal of saving the country with domestic goods. Once the group is fully prepared and formally established, it will use the spare time of each member to carry out the work, such as (1) Promotion Department: (A) Written promotion, the group will compile and print publications to extensively promote pure domestic products. (B) Entertainment promotion, compiling plays that are both cautionary and contain elements of domestic products, and performing in various local and foreign locations during the members' spare time. (C) Lectures, assigning members to give lectures on domestic products in various places. (2) Sales Department: The group will act as an agent for the sale of pure domestic products from manufacturers. (3) Entertainment Department: Providing various legitimate entertainment activities to help the members' interests. He continued that the group is in its early stages of establishment, and everything needs to be done. He hopes that scholars and talents from all walks of life at home and abroad will not hesitate to offer guidance.</p>
<p>Declaration: The Amateur National Products Promotion Group declared, "To revive the nation, the first priority is to revitalize industry, and to recover rights and interests, the only way is to stop the outflow of wealth." Therefore, since the national crisis, the call for promoting domestic products has been loud and the theory of revitalizing industry has been widely advocated. This is because people with insight are trying to save themselves. However, when we examine the results, the dimness of domestic products remains, and the rampantness of foreign goods is even more severe, which makes people shake their heads and sigh. The reason for this is that Chinese people are often superficial and engage in empty talk, with many speaking loudly but few determined to put things into practice. This is one reason. Secondly, the domestic products movement has failed to patiently and earnestly persuade people, leaving them with a deep and indelible impression and arousing the concept of loving and using domestic products. As a result, although the domestic products movement is like bamboo shoots after rain, it has failed to achieve practical results. Is this just a coincidence? Promoting domestic products must involve deep and insightful lectures to awaken our compatriots from their illusions, and cautionary performances to enlighten the people, so as to arouse their enthusiasm for purchasing domestic products and strengthen their patriotic spirit, thereby achieving the grand goal of developing domestic products and the purpose of promoting the sales of domestic products. Therefore, promoting domestic products must begin with performances. We are not talented, but we believe that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. How can we sit idly by? Therefore, we dare not overestimate our abilities and have organized the Amateur National Products Performance Troupe to promote domestic products in our spare time, fulfilling the national duty of citizens and seeking the development of industry. We hope that leaders of industry at home and abroad will not hesitate to offer guidance and correct our shortcomings. This is our declaration."</p>

<p>A Large Number of Gambling Tools and Gambling Funds Seized</p>
<p>All Handed Over to the General Bureau for Legal Action</p>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned that Hou Fusheng, a local from Houqiaobian, Gaojing Temple, Jiangwan Town, had set up a Fuxin Tea Garden and prepared a large number of gambling tools, gathering ignorant people from nearby to gamble day and night, with huge gains and losses. Hou Fusheng profited from it. He ordered detectives Chen Caifu and Dong Wenrui to lead detectives and officers from the Jiangwan Police Station, all in disguise, to secretly go to the tea shop at about 1 a.m. yesterday, pretending to be gamblers and mixing into the gambling venue. While the gamblers were in high spirits, the detectives and officers arrested them. The gamblers tried to jump out of windows and climb over the roof to escape. The order was chaotic for a while. As a result, in addition to arresting the gambling boss Hou Fusheng, 39 gamblers, including Tao Rongsheng, Shen Xijin, Wang Kelang, Li Zuzu, Wang Linsheng, Lu Juxiang, Shen Liansheng, Shen Xiaomao, Wang Yanliang, Tan Tao, Qin Jinshu, Xu Fubao, Gao Yongfa, Lu Taotao, Zhang Lingen, Zhou Miaoxing, Xi Yansheng, Zhang Hongsheng, Meng Yongxiang, Wang Guitang, Gu Shengxiang, Cao Maofu, Yang Caisheng, Ma Songgen, Jiang Fufu, Wang Xiangxiang, Tao Jinfu, etc., were caught on the spot, and gambling tools such as four sets of mahjong tiles, two sets of paper flower cards, and two sets of Pai Gow tiles, and gambling funds of 31 yuan and 44 cents in small change were seized. The team took the suspects to the bureau yesterday morning. The suspects were all vague in their words and were handed over to the Third Section of the General Bureau for handling according to law. In addition, the gambling dens with a cut in No. 6, Lane 193, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, were also investigated by Li, the director of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He immediately dispatched Chen Shengtiao, a patrol officer from the Liyuan Road Police Substation under his jurisdiction, to secretly go to the address at about 11 p.m. the night before. He arrested the gambling boss Luo Xiaomao and 19 gamblers, including Chen Xiaosan, Xi Xiaomao, Wang Ligen, Chen Dalang, Luo Bingsheng, Qian Linsheng, Xia Chunchun, Yu Heshang, Sun Zhangtao, Lu Youlin, etc. Gambling tools such as playing cards and dice were seized on the spot and taken to the bureau. Yesterday morning, bureau member Lin Qishan summoned the case and interrogated the suspects. They all admitted to gambling. They were handed over to the General Bureau in the afternoon for handling according to law.</p>

<p>A Knife from a Beef Stall Was Used as a Murder Weapon</p>
<p>Four Men Fled After Committing the Crime</p>
<p>Jiang Youqing, 35 years old, from Shaoxing, is in the soy sauce business and lives at No. 22 Hongfuli, Xinzha Road. At about 6:50 p.m. yesterday, Jiang had a friend from his hometown come to Shanghai. He was also acquainted with a person nicknamed Xiaomao who lived at No. 10 Hongjili, Soy Sauce Lane, Xinzha Road. After having dinner at Jiang's place, they went together to Xiaomao's house in Hongjili. However, Xiaomao had already gone out and only his wife was at home. At the same time, four other men were sitting in the living room, threatening Xiaomao's wife to collect debts, with a menacing manner. When Jiang Youqing saw that Xiaomao himself was not there, he felt that they should not be threatening his family and spoke up for them, arguing with the debt collectors. They disagreed with each other and started arguing. Unexpectedly, the four men ran to the beef stall at the entrance of the lane, grabbed a beef knife, and stabbed Jiang in the shoulder and back before fleeing. Jiang was seriously injured and unable to chase them, so they escaped. He immediately reported to the police station and had them taken to the hospital for treatment. He also tracked down the murderers.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Residents of Chenxing Lane on Yangshupu Road, Forced to Demolish Mezzanines by the Municipal Council, Appeal for Assistance <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>There are 300 houses in Chenxing Lane on Parker Road in this city, most of which are single-family houses. The residents are all poor people. Due to the high rent, and according to the common practice in Shanghai, they all built awnings and mezzanine floors in the houses. This was discovered by the Engineering Department of the Municipal Council, which first ordered the awnings to be removed. Those who did not have time to remove them were all smashed. The day before yesterday, they ordered the removal of the mezzanine floors, which caused great panic among the residents. They convened a meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures. They decided to send representatives to petition the Municipal Council first. If it is ineffective, all the residents, men, women, old and young, will petition the Municipal Council in teams until the goal is achieved. At the same time, they will submit petitions to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, and the Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens' Union, requesting them to uphold justice and provide assistance. The petition to each agency is as follows: "Petition for the Public Concession Municipal Council to impose oppression and discriminate against residents, requesting justice and assistance. We, the tenants of No. 253 Lane, Parker Road, Shanghai (Chenxing Lane), are all brokers. In recent years, the market has been bleak and all industries have been depressed. Life is difficult and it is difficult to make ends meet. The rent for single-family, multi-story houses in this lane is as high as 50 yuan per month, not including the house tax and electricity bill. We, the tenants, cannot afford it, so we also follow the common practice in Shanghai and build awnings and mezzanine floors in the houses to supplement our income. The houses in this lane were completed in September of this year, and the tenants moved in and renovated the houses three months ago, and there was no other reason. Unexpectedly, in October, the Public Concession Municipal Council suddenly sent letters to each tenant, ordering them to remove the awnings within seven days. Some tenants did not have time to remove them due to various reasons. The bureau sent armed patrolmen to lead the workers, who were like wolves and tigers, and smashed and beat them indiscriminately. At that time, all the people in the lane were crying and shouting, and the state was uneasy. On the 28th of last month, the bureau took a step forward and sent letters to each tenant, ordering them to remove the mezzanine floors within seven days. The tenants felt that they had already lost a lot of awnings, and they could not bear to remove the mezzanine floors again. The tenants of this lane sent representatives to the bureau with a document to petition for exemption from removal. The officials from the Engineering Department of the bureau met with them and asked them again and again. They refused to allow it, citing fire hazards. We have found that awnings and mezzanine floors are common decorations in Shanghai and can be seen everywhere. We have never heard of any ban, but we are the only ones being serious about in this lane. Residents are also residents within the boundary. Why are we the only ones being discriminated against? Moreover, the lane has been completed for three months, and tenants have moved in and renovated the houses one after another. The bureau did not disclose any announcements in advance, nor did it stop them halfway. When the houses were completed, they began to ban them. This is simply teasing the residents and arbitrarily imposing oppression. Even if the bureau is learning from the past and planning for the future and will completely remove the awnings and mezzanine floors in Shanghai to prevent fire hazards, then why not publish an announcement in advance and suddenly start from this lane? Most of the tenants in this lane are poor people. To rent these houses and build awnings and mezzanine floors, they have spent hundreds of yuan, many of which are from loans and mortgages. If they are really removed, it is equivalent to bankruptcy, and there will be unimaginable tragic facts. It will also cause great panic throughout Shanghai. Now, the tenants in this lane have held a meeting to discuss and decided to be willing to understand the bureau's intention to prevent fire hazards. The awnings will be re-built according to the license, and the mezzanine floors will not be allowed to be inhabited. We have always admired your departments (bureaus) (associations) for upholding justice and relieving the suffering of the people. We hereby submit a petition to your departments (bureaus) (associations) for review and approval. We humbly ask you to consider the small people and the oppression they have suffered, and that there is no way to appeal. Please grant us assistance and forward a letter to the bureau, allowing the awnings to be re-built according to the license and the mezzanine floors to be used only for storing items and not for living in, in order to prevent fire hazards and relieve the difficulties of the people. This would be a great virtue."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Tenants of Qinyuli, Yangshupu Road, Who Were Cut Off from Water, Ask the City Federation for Relief <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Association Sent a Relief Section to Mediate</p>
<p>The owner of Qinyuli on Yangshupu Road in this city, Qinyu Company, cut off the water supply to coerce tenants to increase water fees. The tenants petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and order the restoration of the water supply to maintain drinking water. Yesterday, they specially submitted a petition to the Citizens' Union of the First Special Zone, requesting relief. The petition stated that the houses of Qinyuli on Yangshupu Road belong to the owner Li Xueqin and have been leased for five or six years. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the rent was increased by one yuan, including the water fee. The house ticket also clearly stated that the water in the lane was supplied by the owner. Recently, the owner suddenly used the name of disguised rent increase and forcibly collected a water fee of two yuan per household. Without the consent of the tenants, the owner cut off the water supply to coerce the tenants and demolished the water pipes in the entire lane, cutting off the drinking water of thousands of people and ordering them to move out. The tenants have been oppressed and more than a dozen households have gone bankrupt. The losses suffered are countless. They have to ask your association for relief as soon as possible to save the endangered tenants. Moreover, urban tap water is a necessity for human life. The owner must know that he is only interested in profit and does not care about life. He acts arbitrarily and requests you to send someone to mediate. After learning the situation, the association immediately sent the investigation section to mediate and asked the owner to open the water supply immediately to protect the people's lives and ensure social stability. The two sides are currently in consultation and the water supply will be taken over and opened soon.</p>
<h3 id="e136">High Court Branch Secretary Accused of Embezzlement; Court Grants Non-Prosecution <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Various documents do not contain any mention of interest coupons.</p>
<p>The court cannot provide evidence unfavorable to the defendant.</p>
<p>Wang Jusheng of Zida Lumber Firm and Wang Xiankang, owner of Changtai Construction Factory, had a dispute over payment for goods at the end of last year. Bian Jialu, a lawyer, represented them and filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division, accusing Wang of issuing a check for 12,000 yuan, along with a civil suit. In January of this year, Jusheng again petitioned the court, requesting a preliminary injunction to seize 13,000 yuan of Wang Xiankang's uncollected construction funds at Dasha Commercial Bank. After the execution court judge approved the injunction, Jusheng was ordered to provide a guarantee. Jusheng complied and submitted twelve long-term financial government bonds of the 17th year of the Republic of China from the Ministry of Finance, each with a face value of 1,000 yuan, totaling 12,000 yuan, to his lawyer, Bian, who submitted them to the court on the 22nd of the same month. Subsequently, the preliminary injunction was implemented. The execution office received the government bonds and transferred them to the accounting department of the High Court Branch for safekeeping. In September, Jusheng and Wang reached an out-of-court settlement, and Jusheng petitioned the court to lift the preliminary injunction and retrieve the</p>
<p>government bonds provided as security. The court approved the request and issued a retrieval order on October 1st, instructing Jusheng to present it to the accounting department of the High Court Branch to collect the government bonds. That afternoon, Jusheng specifically went to the accounting department of the High Court Branch on West Ash Road to collect the financial government bonds. He discovered that twelve interest coupons dated September 30th, totaling 150 yuan, had been clipped off the bonds. He immediately protested. Jusheng wanted to retrieve the original receipt, but the accounting department refused, stating that it had already been registered and canceled. With no resolution, Jusheng had to take back the bonds. However, since the original petition had clearly stated that the bonds included interest coupons dated September 30th, he felt aggrieved by their sudden disappearance. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the Second Special District Court's prosecutor's office, accusing the duty secretary of the High Court Branch's accounting department's fee collection office of</p>
<p>dereliction of duty and embezzlement, requesting investigation. Prosecutor Wang Ren summoned Li Shu (41 years old, from Xiushan, Sichuan), the secretary in charge of the government bonds in the accounting department of the High Court Branch; Feng Bangyan, secretary of the Third Special District Court's dispatch office; Wang Hui and Liu Gui (Liu has since resigned), secretaries of the execution office; and the duty secretary of the fee collection office; as well as the plaintiff Qu Jisheng, witness Song Benren, and Bian Jialu, the lawyer who originally handled Qu's case, to open a court investigation. The details of the case have been reported in previous news. After several thorough investigations by Prosecutor Wang, including inquiries with various banks in central China that handled the bond interest payments and the National Debt Fund Management Committee, it was determined that the interest had not yet been claimed. The investigation concluded that the evidence presented by the plaintiff was insufficient to prove the defendant's</p>
<p>illegal behavior. Therefore, a decision was made to not prosecute the case. The non-prosecution decision has now been delivered. The non-prosecution decision is transcribed below: Non-Prosecution Decision of the Prosecutor of the Second Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai, Case No. 4 of the 23rd year. Defendant: Li Shu, male, 41 years old, from Xiushan, Sichuan, serving as a secretary in the accounting department of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, residing at the hospital. The above-mentioned defendant, in the case of suspected dereliction of duty and embezzlement, Case No. 11 of the investigative character in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, has been investigated by this prosecutor, and it is deemed that non-prosecution should be implemented. The facts and reasons are hereby stated as follows: It has been found that the defendant, Li Shu, is a secretary in the accounting department of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The plaintiff, Qu Jisheng, and Wang Kang, etc., requested a preliminary injunction due to overdue payments and received a ruling ordering the provision of 12,000 yuan in silver dollars as a guarantee. Twelve long-term financial government bonds of the 17th year of the Republic of China from the Ministry of Finance were prepared, with a face value of</p>
<p>12,000 yuan. On January 20th of this year, the bonds were entrusted to lawyer Jialu, who submitted a petition to this court on the 22nd of the same month for use as security. The dispatch office received and sent the bonds to the civil execution office for verification. On March 2nd, the civil execution office transferred the bonds to Li Shu for safekeeping through the fee collection office of the High Court Branch. Later, Qu Jisheng submitted a statement stating that the case had been settled and requested the revocation of the preliminary injunction and the return of the guaranteed bonds. The civil execution office approved the request on October 1st and issued a retrieval order, instructing Qu to present it for collection. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, Li Shu handed over ten sheets of the aforementioned bonds to Qu Jisheng outside his office. After receiving them, Qu Jisheng went back into the office. Immediately Qu Jisheng shouted, presented the ticket that it was short, entered the room, searched and questioned Li Shu, who replied that he was unaware of the situation and that he should talk to the court. Qu Jisheng said that the bond tickets did not match and did not want to receive them, requesting that the delivery order be returned. Li Shu refused, saying that it had already been registered and canceled, and because Qu Jisheng</p>
<p>was persistently pestering him, he ordered him out. This is based on the records in the case receipt book, civil execution book, payment notification slip, temporary receipt report, the daily fee collection book with the accounting department's seal, the delivery order, the disbursement report, the receipt, and the original petition, as well as the statements of Qu Jisheng, Li Shu, Ren Fugui, etc., which are extremely clear. According to the plaintiff's intention, the interest coupons attached to the original twelve bonds were all due on September 30th of this year. When the due interest coupons were returned, the face value was short of 150 silver dollars. Since the bonds were returned by the defendant and were missing, he is suing them. It should be investigated whether the defendant has clipped the interest coupons or not, as the standard for determining the responsibility for the incident. According to the use of Qu Jisheng, the original each had September 30th of this year,</p>
<p>due interest coupons is true, and according to Bian Jialu, the same is true. However, the original bond tickets were borrowed by Qu Jisheng on January 20th and sent to Bian Jialu. Bian Jialu then submitted the petition to the dispatch office on January 12th, and it was transferred to the defendant on March 2nd. Since the defendant had read it many days later, and since it was handled by people, a careful reading of the documents shows that, apart from the sentence [interest coupon face value from September 30th, Republic of China year 23] in Qu Jisheng's petition on January 22nd, only one entry is found within the original documentary evidence in the case receiving book, the civil execution book, and various receipts which states twelve long-term financial government bonds of the 17th year of the Republic of China with a face value of 12,000 yuan, and there is no mention of interest coupons. After separately summoning the secretaries and clerks of each section in charge of receiving and transferring the bonds for collective questioning, it was stated that the entry of the incoming bond ticket was initially copied into the book based on the documentary evidence column on the incoming petition. That is, the books, delivery forms, and transfers</p>
<p>were based on the records in the incoming documents. No attention was paid to whether interest coupons were attached or not. Therefore, when the bond ticket reached the defendant, it could not be determined whether the interest coupons due on September 30th, as claimed by Qu Jisheng, were still attached. In other words, there is no sufficient positive proof that the interest coupons were actually handed over to the defendant for receipt and safekeeping, and it cannot be hastily concluded that the defendant clipped the interest coupons. Furthermore, inquiries were made with various banks in central China that handled the interest payments and the National Debt Fund Management Committee, and it was determined that the interest coupons had not been paid out. When questioning Qu Jisheng, he was ordered to present the original bond ticket to examine the situation of the clipped interest coupons. He claimed that after retrieving the bond ticket, he had returned it to the original person to sell it. Therefore, it is no longer possible to investigate the truth of how they were clipped. Furthermore, there is no collateral evidence that can be investigated. Since it cannot provide evidence unfavorable to the defendant, a finding favorable to the defendant can be made. It should be considered that there is insufficient suspicion of a crime, and in accordance with Article 244, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision of non-prosecution is hereby issued.

<p>Dr. Eddy's Speech, Bingxun Stenography Society, Shen Wan Stenography</p>
<p>The well-known American orator, Dr. Eddy, gave his first public speech at Moore Hall, entitled [The Crisis of China and the World], chaired by Dr. Tu Yuqing, translated by Mr. Shen Tilan, and recorded by Shen Wan of the Bingxun Stenography Society. The record of his speech is as follows: This time I traveled around the world, passing through twenty countries, and in China, I passed through twenty large cities. When we left the United States, President Roosevelt was staying in France to save the American economic panic, and wanted to use a new system to remedy this economic panic. Later, when I arrived in the United Kingdom, I also saw the British Prime Minister, also for the sake of economic panic, wanting to save the British economic panic. This kind of global economic panic first occurred in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, and later affected China and the entire world. When I arrived in Germany, I heard Hitler's speech, he told people that in order to implement his ideas, he killed seventy-seven people. If anyone wanted to oppose him, he would treat that person in the same way. However, in Germany, many people are unemployed, and they hope all day long how to overthrow him, because he doesn't give them bread to eat, and he doesn't give them work to do. When I was in Soviet Russia, I also saw that Soviet Russia produced a new system. The people there are not unemployed, but the bread problem is still as serious as ever. Although they have a method of distributing bread, they still cannot solve this problem. We have seen that since the European war, the vitality of the economic situation in various countries around the world has not been fully restored. We see that the whole world is in a state of economic panic. This kind of economic panic indicates that there is a major problem with the modern social system, so we must find a way to save it. Now there is unrest in the whole world, political unrest, students are dissatisfied with the existing system, there is economic panic, and there are many unemployed people everywhere. Students have no jobs. In the United States, one-fourth of the students are unemployed, and they rely on relief to survive. The government is discussing relief methods. Now, many students in China are also unemployed, and they don't know what to do or where to go to find a way out. Why are they unemployed to this extent? The people and workers of all countries in the world are suffering. Looking at it from a historical perspective, I believe that now is a time of transformation, greater than the era of the Renaissance, and greater than the revolutions in the United States, France, and Soviet Russia. Now we have reached a new era of progress, and the old system is collapsing. We know that every historical transformation is accompanied by suffering. Students, workers, and farmers suffer, that is, ordinary people also suffer. We know that mankind, in history, must go through four economic stages. Under the feudal system, we can find that serfs are appendages of landlords. Under the feudal system, landlords have a lot of land, and people and land can be sold in the same way. Under the capitalist system, a small number of people have the means of production, and the majority of people use the means of production of a small number of people to make a living. A small number of people have patents on these means of production, such as tap water, electric lights, kerosene, and various other things, which are all in the hands of a small number of people. A small number of people get too much benefit, and they don't know how to use it. Too many people get too little benefit, and they cannot survive, so there will be turmoil. A small number of people have money, and the majority of people are poor. Under the socialist system, everyone can produce, contribute, and sometimes it may not be easy to have a violent action. In the Danish or British Labor Party, there is no such move. Today, we have reached a stage that is coming to an end. Capitalism is collapsing day by day. In China, the feudal system is collapsing. In the United States, capitalism is also collapsing. This is a period of transformation. Widespread unemployment indicates the selfishness of the past. Therefore, there is a crisis in China, a crisis in the United States, a crisis in Europe, and a crisis in the world. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e150">National Labor Exhibition, Day Two <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Extremely Crowded Yesterday, Over Ten Thousand Visitors</p>
<p>Starting Today, Admission by Ticket Required Except for Groups</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 2nd) The 2nd was a Sunday, and people from all walks of life went to visit the National Labor Exhibition in an endless stream. The exhibition venue was small, and there were too many products from various provinces, which were not enough to display. Therefore, the sidewalk in the venue was reduced to less than three feet, and two people could not walk side by side. Initially, it was not expected that there would be more than 10,000 visitors, resulting in a crowded venue, poor order, and exhibits being knocked down. This happened in every hall. In order to remedy the situation, the organizing committee closed the entrance gate at 4:00 PM, allowing people to exit but not enter, and temporarily issued admission tickets. An urgent notice was issued stating that, starting from the 3rd, admission to the exhibition would be by ticket only. In addition to the schedule for primary and secondary schools to visit, admission tickets have been sent to all agencies and universities in the capital. Please ask the leaders of your respective agencies for them. Other sectors of society, please go to the Propaganda Office of the Ministry of Education to collect tickets before coming to the exhibition. Those without tickets will not be admitted. More military police have been dispatched to maintain order. Exhibits in each hall will be reorganized overnight. Visitors such as Ye Chucang and Shao Yuanchong have expressed their opinions on the evaluation book.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Exhibition Venue Visit Notes (3) Student <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Area: The most distinctive products of this province are three: (1) Various silk specimens from sericulture schools; (2) Two national defense design units and sports field design units from Dinghai Primary School. Under the national defense unit, there are maps, warships, and fortresses arranged among them, with airplanes and airships soaring in the sky, a unique sight; (3) Exhaustive, exquisitely made embroidery. In terms of vocational schools, there are many crop specimens from agricultural schools and machine specimens from industrial schools. The yarn spinning model from middle school and the Jinhua wooden ham model are quite unique. The physics instruments, marine product specimens, and teaching units of primary schools, such as "Where do clothes come from?" and "Where do woolen fabrics come from?", are of particular research value. Other specimens of gold, wood, bamboo, stone, gypsum, etc., number about 3,000 items, too many to list. From Zhejiang, heading northeast to</p>
<p>Jiangxi Area: What first catches the eye is the porcelain of Jiangxi. Unfortunately, there are too few pieces to make a grand spectacle. According to representative Mr. Yu, the products of Jiangxi this time are very ordinary. They were not specially processed and manufactured for the exhibition. The exhibits are all selected from peacetime achievements. However, the porcelain part is indeed too small to represent the characteristics of Jiangxi. A telegram has been sent to the Jiujiang Pottery School to add selected exhibits, which should arrive in the capital within a day or two, at which time it will be able to satisfy the eyes of the people of the capital. Achievements are also divided into three parts: vocational, middle school, and primary school. The vocational section includes printing, leather, weaving, printing and dyeing, embroidery, mat weaving, agricultural crops, silk, etc. There are also the incubator and grass-killing powder invented by the agricultural school, which are quite valuable. The middle school section includes metalwork, woodwork, pith paper crafts, toys, rattan wax paper crafts, gypsum, sewing, etc. There are self-made globes, wood specimens, balances, mousetraps, and a design unit for water-powered rice milling and irrigation, as well as mathematics teaching aids, which are more distinctive. The primary school classification is the same as the middle school. Various self-made exercise books are the most distinctive. The total number of exhibits is about ten items. After exiting the second hall and climbing to the third hall, the first part of the Mingzhi Building is</p>
<p>Anhui Area: The exhibits total more than 3,000 items. The best exhibits are displayed on the stage, including two large boxes of new village design models, four pieces of Hunan embroidery, and six sets of wooden physiological models. Other items are numerous and similar to those in the first hall. The furniture and toys in the primary school section have a systematic explanation of the process, which is easier to attract attention. From here, turning into</p>
<p>Chahar Area: The most distinctive achievements in this area are woolen thread, leather, and practical goods. Various daily-use furniture such as rattan trees and reed brushes are all practical and do not seek beauty. Other fabrics, toys, carvings, etc. are also slightly available. The educational foundation of this province is far inferior to that of the provinces in the south of the Yangtze River. It is not easy to achieve this achievement. The total number of exhibits is about 1,000 items.</p>
<p>Shanxi: The labor works of middle and primary schools each amount to about eight or nine hundred items. The agricultural products are the most spectacular, such as pumpkins, turnips, and potatoes, which are incredibly large. The seeds of rice and wheat are also very impressive.</p>
<p>Qingdao: The essence of the third hall. Mr. Xi and Mr. Yan told me that Qingdao City's schools focus on home economics, and secondly, because of the proximity to the sea, they also pay great attention to marine products. The most important products in home economics are various embroidery, sewing, and weaving, so the clothes, chair cushions, etc. are very beautiful. There are Western-style pastries in cooking, and there are many types of marine product specimens, which are dazzling. The salt pan model and the entire agricultural tool model are all unit designs. Middle schools focus on woodworking manufacturing, various practical furniture, and many other items such as metalwork, papermaking, stationery, and chemical crafts. The most distinctive feature of primary schools is self-made scientific instruments. Among the woven items, the most exquisite are various items woven from grass. The total number of exhibits is nearly 1,000 items.</p>
<p>Suiyuan: Due to the remote location, very few exhibits were sent to the exhibition. Therefore, the area occupied by the display is also small. The reference department hangs and displays many provincial poverty tables, which are worthy of research. Shaanxi: The exhibits are about 400 items. The carpet with novel patterns is the most distinctive. The woolen fabrics are very good. The East Four Provinces map of cut thread is particularly thought-provoking. Other items are displayed separately according to the examples of various provinces.</p>
<p>Weihaiwei: Dozens of exhibits.</p>
<p>Ningxia: A total of 20 exhibits. Camel hair clothing and woolen fabrics are the best.</p>
<p>Qinghai: A total of 30-odd exhibits. Wool ropes, carpets, and leather are good.</p>
<p>Sichuan: A total of 100-odd exhibits. The bamboo curtains are extremely delicate and elegant.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Problems Discovered in the Labor Exhibition Wu Yan Yin <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The labor exhibition, the initial labor exhibition, we naturally should not demand perfection from it. However, from the impression I got after browsing it once, in addition to the positive aspects of being beautiful and having a bit of a creative spirit, there seem to be several problems that can be raised for research in the negative aspects.</p>
<p>(1) There seems to be too little agricultural work in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Our country is an agricultural country, and the social economy has not yet broken away from the agricultural era. Primary and secondary schools, especially primary schools and normal schools, should pay great attention to agricultural work. Because many primary school students are children of farmers, and there are not a few normal school graduates who become rural instructors. Paying attention to agricultural work to enable them to have knowledge and skills in agricultural work, and to have the ideals and attempts to improve agriculture, is very important. The number of achievements in agricultural work in this labor exhibition is very small, which shows that there are too few primary and secondary schools that actually pay attention to agricultural work. This may be because most of the exhibits are from urban primary and secondary schools and children of citizens, but urban primary and secondary schools should also have some achievements in fields such as gardening and animal husbandry.</p>
<p>(2) It seems that handicrafts in primary and secondary schools still focus on delicate small-piece handicrafts.</p>
<p>The exhibits this time are very different from the handicrafts of more than ten years ago, which were just paper-folding and paper-weaving. However, there are still few practical exhibits, and most of them are small models, toys, stationery, etc., which still cannot get rid of the old-fashioned handicraft style. Primary school children can only stick to the slogan of "making toys when they are young, and making airplanes when they grow up," but older primary school students, junior high school students, and normal school students should make more large-scale items such as furniture and school equipment. Because the most important goal of labor education is to cultivate the ability of children and young people to work, and to make them sweat more. If we focus solely on delicate small-piece handicrafts, it is still almost the same as the old-fashioned scholar's seal engraving, painting, and calligraphy. At best, it is just using the hands. If the body does not labor, where will the sweat come from?</p>
<p>(3) It seems that the various exhibits of primary and secondary schools focus more on aestheticization and less on the meaning of production.</p>
<p>Although there are many practical and popular exhibits, such as local agricultural household appliances, most of the achievements still seem to be working on the aesthetic side, and the meaning of production is very small. Beauty is an important condition for crafts, sewing, etc., but if you pursue beauty too much, one is that it wastes a lot of effort and energy for children and young people, and it may not conform to the principles of economics, and the other is that it is often delicate but not practical, and the production value will not be seen much. In the exhibition, people compete for novelty and uniqueness, fearing that the exhibits are not beautiful, in order to win the admiration of the audience. This is the common psychology of people, but labor work is labor's work, and labor is the work of labor, the most important thing is not to lose the meaning of production education, and it is very different from fine arts and artworks. If you deliberately seek workmanship, regardless of labor costs, and it is not necessarily possible to sell it.</p>
<p>(4) The exhibits from a small number of places seem to be inevitably miscellaneous.</p>
<p>The exhibits from most places are generally still between labor work and handicraft, and they also have their own characteristics. Some of the imitation instruments are no different from commodities, and more teaching aids have the meaning of creativity and invention. However, some places not only have very few exhibits, but also inevitably have miscellaneous items. For example, the collected plant specimens, and the fabric samples collected by primary school students, etc., although made by students, are not achievements within the scope of the labor course. Also, paintings and sculptures, etc., from non-art schools are actually treated as labor achievements and transported here as an example, which is even beyond the scope of labor work. The staff in charge of labor work thought that if they removed these kinds of things, the labor exhibits from some provinces would be even less, so they still let them be displayed, but it is too far from the meaning of the labor exhibition.</p>
<p>The above four points are the main points I have noticed. In addition, some exhibits take foreign raw materials at will, some exhibits are made in foreign styles, and some exhibits seem to exceed the production capacity of students, which inevitably makes people doubt... These are all small details, and I won't say much. I think this is a phenomenon that should exist in the initial exhibits. I hope that primary and secondary schools will pay attention to improving labor education and make extra efforts in the future. According to my opinion, the aspects of future efforts are:</p>
<p>(1) Primary and secondary schools and normal schools should pay attention to agricultural work, and at least have some facilities such as gardening.</p>
<p>(2) If primary and secondary schools and normal schools focus on crafts, the equipment of the factory must be complete, so that students can do more large-scale labor practice. (3) Primary and secondary schools and normal schools should pay attention to cultivating labor teachers at all levels in order to improve labor education.</p>
<p>(4) Primary and secondary schools and normal schools should implement the labor curriculum standards in a practical way, and not continue to follow the old-fashioned handicraft practices.</p>
<p>(5) The principle of labor work exhibits in middle schools should be production, and although primary school labor works cannot be directly produced, they also have some educational significance of production.</p>
<p>As for the exhibits of vocational schools, they are naturally more neat than the exhibits of primary and secondary schools. However, in China, which emphasizes agriculture, there are too few agricultural vocational schools, so the achievements of agricultural schools in this labor exhibition are not easy to attract attention. How to promote the establishment of more agricultural vocational schools in the future is something that educational administrators should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Exiting the third hall and going down the stairs, Achievement Hall is the location of the fourth hall. Entering a small room is the exhibition area for the experimental school of the Central University. Turning into the fourth hall, it is full of brilliance, as if entering a large art museum. What is displayed is</p>
<p>Hunan's Hunan embroidery. There are 150 items of this embroidery on display, most of which are framed calligraphy and paintings. There are also seven embroidered portraits on the walls, which are portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, He Jian, and others. They are exquisitely made and breathtaking. There are about 100 items of sewing, most of which are packed in paper boxes. In addition, there are more than 80 mechanical items, 200 items of dyeing and weaving, about 120 items of applied chemistry, about 20 items of agricultural products, about 15 items of silk, and about 1,000 items of other labor works such as metalwork, woodwork, and carving. Many of them are exquisite and elegant.</p>
<p>Shanghai City Exhibits (Photo by Zhonghua, Nanjing)</p>
<p>Hubei occupies the central part of the fourth hall. There are about 1,000 exhibits in total. There is a rockery garden in the middle, and there are many machine-woven fabrics, metalwork, woodwork, and chemical crafts. The representative of the province, Mr. Ma, is arranging everything by himself, and he is very busy. The wooden warship models, rattan characters, and wooden couplets are all very exquisite. Turning from here to</p>
<p>Fujian Exhibition area, which is located in the northwest corner of the hall, is full of brilliance. The four most outstanding items are: (1) Lacquerware produced by the Huier Institute, such as vases, figure screens, plates, boxes, cups, etc., all of which are very exquisite. The school is a work-study program, so students pay great attention to hand-brain training. The sale of lacquerware in Fujian has occupied an important position. The exhibits participating in the exhibition this time are worth about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. (2) The projection and architectural specimens of the Provincial Industrial Vocational School. These specimens are accurately manufactured and are the most important instruments of the industrial school. It is said that if purchased from abroad, each set costs about 1,000 yuan or more. Now the school can make it by itself at a low price, only one-tenth of the imported products. (3) Rattanware. Fujian has a long history of making rattanware, and the rattanware products are far better than those of other provinces. (4) Bamboo ware, including a complete set of structures for study rooms and living rooms, etc., is very good. The method of display is also in accordance with the standards of each hall. In terms of vocational aspects, chemical Jiangsu Province Primary School Exhibits (Photo by Zhonghua, Nanjing)</p>
<p>Crafts, agricultural products, manufactured goods, balances, and other metalwork items are all items actually sold on the market. The silk products of the girls' school are very modern. The metalwork and woodwork of middle schools… etc. amount to about 3,000 items, with the Provincial Fuzhou Middle School accounting for the largest part. There are many labor works in primary schools, with residential design models, bamboo work, self-made various instruments and farm implements, and sports equipment being the best. There are two units: (1) A salt pan exposed to sunlight, and (2) The entire set of tools for picking longan, which are textbooks that are tailored to the local conditions of the province, and the intention is also very commendable. Turning from here to</p>
<p>Guangdong Guangxi The joint front of the two Guangs has formed a grand spectacle. The grass mats and rattanware of Zhaoqing have long been famous and renowned throughout the country. The school's ability to have these products shows that the province pays attention to production education. The vocational products include silkworm specimens and animal specimens, including giant pythons. The metalwork includes cement steel bone models, the velvet flower screens of female students, and the pottery made by middle schools are all excellent products unique to the province. The table pianos, school models, and fabric patterns made by primary schools are all very numerous. The total number of exhibits is about four or five hundred items.</p>
<p>Yunnan is the last part of the exhibition venue. There are only dozens of exhibits, such as embroidery, etc., but it is not easy to travel across the ocean to participate in the exhibition. The venue has come to an end. The reporter then exited the venue. There are 26 participating units, with about 30,000 exhibits. To sum up this tour, although it only lasted a few hours, the impressions gained were excellent and profound. It is lamentable that our country has always regarded scholars as the head of the four classes of people, those who labor with their minds rule others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others. Therefore, the whole country is filled with the idea of ​​"study well and then become an official". The so-called "strange skills and lascivious ingenuity" are called "mean husbands", so the industry is backward, and those who know it regard it as a hidden worry. In recent years, the central education authorities have vigorously promoted production education, and education experts from all over the country have been able to embrace the spirit of poverty and hard work, and work together to achieve this great achievement. This is what we should express our admiration for. Secondly, the products of vocational schools and the labor works of primary and secondary schools are gradually becoming more practical, unlike in the past, when they were merely decorations, in order to win the appreciation of a few artists, and various self-made teaching aids and design units can fully express the progress of today's teaching. This is especially admirable. Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the whole country have a psychology of common hatred for the enemy. The weapons that occupy a large part of the exhibits in various provinces show that colleagues in the education sector pay attention to national defense education. It is deeply hoped that all sectors of society in the country will pay special attention to this conference, in order to correct the past errors of education for officials, then this conference, although it costs the efforts of tens of thousands of people, will have an immortal value.

<h3 id="e153">Order to Improve the Secondary School Normal Department <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a general order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities on the 1st, stating: "Upon investigation, in the past ten years, the number of public and private secondary schools and normal schools has increased sharply, but the quality varies, which has become increasingly apparent. Generally speaking, the equipment of each school is mostly inadequate, the curriculum is chaotic, the teaching methods are outdated, and the education is not fully qualified, resulting in a daily decline in efficiency. The Ministry, in view of this, has successively promulgated standards for secondary schools and normal school curricula and equipment, regulations for teacher certification, and regulations for student joint examinations, in order to improve school curricula and equipment, improve teaching efficiency and student levels, and gradually improve the quality of secondary schools and normal schools. Last year, specialists were again assigned to conduct on-site inspections in various provinces and cities. Based on the reports of the members, orders were issued to comply with the relevant cases. In summary, the reports of the members show that the educational administrative organs of various provinces and cities have, in general, implemented the standards and regulations promulgated by the Ministry, but the situation of chaos and disorder is still common. In severe cases, due to the low level of the past, in order to cope with graduation joint examinations and university entrance examinations, the number of teaching hours has been increased excessively, with some reaching 48 hours per week, violating the principles of learning, damaging the physical and mental health of young people, and causing great harm. In order to correct the accumulated abuses and promote efficiency, the following matters are hereby clarified:</p>
<p>(1) All public and private secondary schools and various normal schools in all provinces and cities should teach in accordance with the prescribed teaching subjects and hours for each grade, and there should be no more differences. For the graduating schools, due to the transition period, the previous teaching has not been sufficient, and it is necessary to prepare for the joint examination, the respective departments and bureaus should determine an appropriate increase in teaching hours, but not exceeding 36 hours per week.</p>
<p>(2) If there are no approved teaching materials for each subject in senior high schools and normal schools, teachers should compile their own teaching materials or select alternative teaching materials in accordance with the curriculum standards of each subject promulgated by the Ministry, and increase or decrease the amount according to the standards.</p>
<p>(3) The equipment fees of all public schools should be purchased in accordance with the equipment standards of the science departments promulgated by the Ministry as soon as possible, and should absolutely not be misappropriated. The board of directors of private schools are responsible for raising funds to enrich the equipment.</p>
<p>(4) All subjects should focus on practical work, such as science and chemistry experiments, biological collection, geographical practice, arithmetic exercises, Chinese reading and writing, and foreign language writing and speaking. Teaching methods should also focus on inspiration and discussion, and should not be purely lectures.</p>
<p>(5) The number of students in each class at all levels of schools shall not exceed the prescribed maximum number. Those who violate this rule will not have their student status reviewed.</p>
<p>The above items shall be implemented uniformly from the second semester of the 23rd year, and the department should conduct strict inspections in accordance with the regulations. The department should immediately comply with the regulations and report accordingly."</p>

<p>After the Chinese Boy Scout General Association was officially established on November 1, it immediately proceeded actively. The current site (at No. 1 Xinjin Lane, Malu Street) is a Western-style building. Although the scale is not very large, the layout is quite clean and tidy. In addition, the chief secretary of the association, Feng Ti, is effective in his supervision, and the atmosphere is vigorous. The work is particularly intense. Currently, all staff members have been required to wear uniforms, which will be made and altered in the middle of next week. Afterwards, there will be a more neat and solemn appearance. As for the internal work, in addition to setting up four sections in accordance with the general regulations, a legal review committee is also set up to review and revise all previous and current laws and regulations. In order to ensure economic transparency, an economic review committee is also set up. All income and expenditure accounts and purchase receipts and supplies within the association must be reviewed and deemed appropriate before they can be processed. In order to improve work efficiency, the association has stipulated that in addition to the weekly meetings of the office and various departments, each staff member must fill out a work report every day for reference. Each department is assigned one person to be on duty each day, and the chief of the department and above is the general duty officer, who takes turns being on duty in order to deal with official business and maintain internal affairs. Even on weekly holidays, the progress of governance will not be delayed. Recently, in order to understand the personality, knowledge, and governance abilities of each staff member, the chief secretary personally set a test, which all staff members from the department chief to the recorder participated in. The recorder's test papers focused on calligraphy. In addition, the organization and training of boy scouts at all levels throughout the country is currently being drafted. In the future, it will be carried out in an orderly manner, and there will be a reorganization of the future of the Chinese boy scouts.</p>
<p>In addition, after the establishment of the association, two memorial weeks for the Prime Minister were held. In order to connect and build momentum, all directors of the Nanjing Boy Scout Council were ordered to participate. The chief secretary, Feng Ti, gave a speech, with many words of encouragement, and individually met with the directors of the Beijing Municipal Council to learn about the work of the Municipal Council. Therefore, under the close guidance of the General Association, the Beijing Municipal Council will also have a new look. In the future, it is planned to regularly invite directors of the National Council to attend the memorial week speech in rotation. It is heard that Chen Lifu, a director, is scheduled to give a speech next week.</p>

<p>Celebration Ceremony Held at 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Dinner Held at Noon</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of Chih Tze College and its affiliated middle school. In view of the national crisis, the school authorities strived for simplicity and only invited alumni and family members to participate. At 10:00 a.m., a celebration ceremony was held in the school's auditorium. At noon, a large-scale dinner party was organized by the student association. More than 1,000 people attended, including faculty, staff, alumni, and male and female students of the school, including He Shimo, He Shimei, He Zuochang, Tang Shichang, Zhang Ke, Zhu Mei, Liu Yunfang, Ren Xianqun, Ni Zheng, Yuan Shuainan, and Pan Jianbo. There was a continuous flow of vehicles on the Shui Dian Road, which was a grand occasion. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Celebration Ceremony The bell rang ten times, and the school's auditorium was full. He Shimei, the dean of academic affairs, presided over the meeting, Ren Xianqun took the minutes, and Li Niankai served as the master of ceremonies. The ceremony was carried out as usual. First, the president (represented by the dean of academic affairs) reported on the past year, briefly stating that the school was founded to fulfill the last wish of the ancestors, and the establishment of the school was due to anti-communism. Preparations began in the autumn of the 13th year of the Republic of China, and the school was established in the spring of the 14th year. Since then, it has been struggling in difficulties and hardships every day. The new school building was completed, and before June, it was almost completely destroyed due to the January 28th Incident. Before June, the school had completed the repairs before the other schools. Although the equipment was not complete, the basic scale was gradually restored to its original state, which was not easy. The application for registration has been repeatedly frustrated due to various reasons. The ability to have today is entirely due to the unyielding and uncompromising spirit of struggle and the concerted efforts of all faculty, staff, and students. In the future, if there can be a stronger solidarity and a more diligent struggle, the progress of the school will increase day by day, and I hope to encourage everyone. Subsequently, Professor Yao Minghui, Professor Zhang Ke, Professor Wang Xiaowen, representative of the middle school Hao Naiding, and representative of the student association Lu Shidao delivered speeches one after another. The words were sincere and touched the audience. The ceremony ended at 12:30.</p>
<p>Dinner Party The school's student association took this opportunity to connect old and new friends and organized a large-scale dinner party. More than 200 people participated, and Tang Shichang presided over the meeting. It was a very interesting gathering. Zhou Yuchun sang the school song, Ye Mianchang and Yang Junming sang "Catching Cao", He Zuochang and Zhao Juzhi sang "Four Lang Visits His Mother", Mao Yinfang and Yang Qingxin sang "Three Mothers Teach Their Son", and Xia Niuhui Zhen's piano solo and Wu Hanfang's comic show and other recreational activities were wonderful and enjoyable. Each person was given a thick commemorative special issue and a Jiangsu Northern issue.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Great Work: Youyou Defeats French Business School 5 to 3 <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Youyou Forwards Have Pure and Skilled Connection</p>
<p>Although French Business School is Brave, It is Still Under Youyou</p>
<p>Recently, the Youyou football team has defeated both the Jews and the Western Merchants. The morale has been boosted, and the reputation has been enhanced. Yesterday, they met the French Business School, the champion of the Western League Group A last season, at Shen Garden. Youyou, with the remaining prestige of victory, was brave. Even though the French Business School reorganized its team and re-used veteran players, the result was still a victory for Youyou with a score of 5 to 2. The yellow dragon went straight in, and everyone was happy. From then on, the revival of the team is hoped to be endless.</p>
<p>The Youyou forwards were not mobilized, and the connection has gradually improved. Yongsen has the style of Cao Guichen, galloping and rushing, and can be regarded as the first choice among all the forwards. It is a pity that he has been transferred to the right inner forward. It can be said to be a good plan for Youyou, but it is not enough for him to fully display his strengths. The right wing of Mei Hongbao has repeatedly missed opportunities, and there is little to commend. The left wing of Wang Nanzhen has gradually shown the magic of pure fire. Given time, he will not be inferior to Wanxianghua. The two generals, Xi Luo, are as good as ever, worthy of being famous generals. The front and back guards are all competent. Jiang Shan Jing has been calmer than before, and his feet have also shown correct moves. If he cultivates more, it will not be difficult to restore his old appearance.</p>
<p>French Business School, the champion of the previous season, did not expect to have nothing to do in this season. They have lost two of five games, showing a very sluggish state. The tiredness of Gu Shitaikeleituo is a major blow. The other generals also cannot come to the arena as scheduled. Moreover, the yellow flowers are old, and the prestige is no longer there. In the battle against Youyou, the veterans gathered, such as Remy Dipakemaishaner and other first-class players all arrived. Compared with the lineup that won the championship last year, only Gusitai and Keleituo are missing. Goalkeeper Fulushou and Walter yesterday were originally in the same league. In terms of talent, it is really above Youyou. Unexpectedly, they were defeated. Ningfei is in charge, the lineup is scattered, and the spirit is weakened, which is the main reason for the defeat. Therefore, Youyou's victory can also be said to be a miracle this season.</p>
<p>When Dengchang, the French Business School changed Nikoloff to the forward position, and he and Maishaner broke the block, which was a major miscalculation. Gai Maishaner will be the old partner of the inner guard. Now that Qin Sheng is transferred to the inner guard, he cannot communicate with Maishaner, leaving a flaw. The Youyou forwards are rampant. Wang Nanzhen's encounter with Qin Sheng is like entering an uninhibited realm. Therefore, the momentum of the Youyou forwards is often due to Wang. In the first half, the result was three to one. In the second half, the French Business School immediately transferred Nikoloff to his original position and switched with Qin Sheng. The back defense was slightly consolidated, and the situation was balanced. Each team scored two goals, resulting in a final score of five to three.</p>
<p>Youyou opened the ball on the surface, but the soldiers were unfavorable. The French Business School rolled in, and the forwards were very rampant. Baoshatuo and Xiao Huater attacked the gate twice, which was very exciting. Fortunately, they did not hit, and the soldiers returned. Youyou chased after them. Huiguang Jinshun and Yongsheng three generals, surrounded and copied, the connection was wonderful, the ball was obtained by Mei Hongbao, and sent to the door from afar. The three generals in the middle were too late to catch up. Wang Nanzhen saw the opportunity and made a move, chasing it like a fly, and topping the gate. It was clear and visible, and the drum of victory was greatly sounded, which was not satisfying to the merchants. Pike broke into the camp with a ball, shot sharply to the ground, and Xu Heng calmly caught it, turning the danger into safety.</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun got the ball in the center and passed it to the front. Yongsheng responded in the middle, and Wang Nanzhen repeated the old trick, rushing up and topping the ball, but was blocked by Qin Sheng. Yongsheng shot twice at an angle, but failed to hit. Then Mei Hongbao received the ball from Zhen Xian and was intercepted by Maishaner. Mei then snatched it back from Maishaner's feet and passed it to the door. Yongsheng was in a bad position and could not kick. He picked it up and sent it to the old Sun. At that time, the gate was densely covered with generals from both sides. Sun wanted to shoot but could not, so he gently picked it up with Yongsheng. Zhong's footwork was not accurate, and he flicked it smoothly. Haiguang waited for the right move, pulled up one foot, and the enemy gate fell again. Youyou then won two consecutive goals.</p>
<p>The French Business School lost two cities in a row and tried to counterattack. Baoshatuo and Da Huater double-rided into the camp, and their momentum was fierce. Jiang Shanjing tried his best to deal with it, and Li Shengguan cleared the danger with one kick. One wave was calm, and another wave rose again. Xiao Huater launched a mutiny from the frontier, passed Jiang Shanjing, and passed it to the bottom line. Fan Qian, like a flying general, descended from the sky, topped the ball head-on, and shot through the corner of the gate, like a flash of lightning. Xu Heng and Wang Shushen stared at each other, helplessly. From then on, the situation of the French Business School showed a slight turning point. Xiao Huater ran across Chencang, and Bao Shatuo helped from the middle. Da Huater shot fiercely at the door, but it flew into the sky and returned without success. The fierce Youyou broke free from the reins and continued to attack, but Mei Hongbao's two crosses were weak. Chen Zhenxiang received the ball returned by Maishaner and returned it to the door. Haiguang deliberately let it go, and Yongsheng knew it and shot forcefully, becoming three to one, ending the first half.</p>
<p>The war broke out again. Western spectators began to clamor because they were dissatisfied with the referee Chen Jixiang. Chinese spectators began to criticize, and the war of words was endless. Unexpectedly, while the noise was going on, Youyou suddenly lost a goal, which was scored by Bao Shatuo, only three minutes after the start of the second half. Youyou was very unwilling, and immediately sent troops to question the crime. Yongsheng entered the dangerous zone and shot the goal with a diagonal kick. The French Business School goalkeeper lay on the ground to block it. Hongbao copied in from the edge, and Yongsheng flew and robbed it, and sent it to the door high. The two generals, Sun Luo, failed to catch it. Wang Nanzhen rushed up and topped the ball, but failed to hit it. At that time, the offensive of both sides was very intense. After the French Business School transferred Nikoloff to the inner guard, the defense was consolidated a lot, and the forwards also suddenly became fierce, and there were mutual dangers. Once Sun Jinshun rushed in with the ball alone. Maishaner chased after him, and Nikoloff caught up horizontally. Lao Sun saw that the situation was not good and kicked the ball. It was still saved by the goalkeeper.</p>
<p>The French Business School was approaching the city, and Jiang Shanjing made a mistake on the top of his head. Da Huater shot hard at the door, and the ball bounced back from the goal. Xu Heng rushed out and missed, Xiao Huater shot again, Wang Shushen intercepted it, and Liang Shutang added another kick, and fortunately escaped danger. It can be said that Youyou was very lucky not to have this ball. If you don't die in a great disaster, you will have good fortune. Youyou did not fail this ball. In a flash, he got a chance to penalize a 12-yard ball, because Yongsheng brought the ball to attack, Maishaner accidentally touched the ball with his hand, and was penalized a 12-yard. Sun Jinshun tried a small knife, and a kick succeeded. Fortune and misfortune are unpredictable, and the French Business School is really unlucky.</p>
<p>Zhong Yongsheng did not stop, worked hard, killed in and out, and was majestic. I saw him rushing and killing alone. Jie Su could not stand it. Zhong advanced to a considerable position and shot diagonally from the side of the door. The goalkeeper lay on the ground to save it. His fingers touched it, but the ball still slipped out and slowly rolled towards the door. Unexpectedly, it hit the post and went out of bounds. Wang Nanzhen's corner kick came, and the landing point was very good. Haiguang topped the ball. Lao Sun did not wait for the ball to land, and took advantage of the momentum to hook the ball in the air. The ball was shot out like a strong crossbow and flew into the door. He had a lot of kung fu. It was time to shoot to the end. In the last two minutes, in the confusion, the French Business School also hit a ball, so it was closed at five to three.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Putting on a forced smile to welcome, lighting a lamp to illuminate the haggard face; following the trend to learn frivolousness.</p>
<p>Little Ji nodded and smiled, saying, "That's fine too. I'll bring her over tomorrow morning. I could have arranged it for the afternoon, but that would be too long." As he said this, he smiled, and in that smile, there seemed to be a hint of teasing Jia Duocai. Jia Duocai really wanted to see the girl, and since the man had offered, he couldn't refuse, but he felt that this tea boy was not easy to deal with and needed to be wary of him. Little Ji's thoughts were exactly the same. He felt that this wealthy man was different from others and couldn't be easily fooled, so he needed to take a careful approach. At that moment, he sorted out some of the affairs at the hotel and then went to Sister Hu's house. Poor people couldn't afford to light oil lamps, so when it got dark, they would grope their way to the bed and lie down. Even if they couldn't fall asleep immediately, with their head on the pillow, they could think about when they could dig up a cellar of silver under the bed. At this time, Sister Hu was thinking about digging a cellar and was getting a little drowsy when she suddenly heard someone knocking on the door outside. She was startled, wondering if it was the military police coming to arrest criminals. So, even though she heard the knocking, she lay on the bed and didn't dare to make a sound. Later, Little Ji directly called out "Sister Hu," and recognizing the voice, she dared to ask what was the matter. Little Ji had a belly full of plans that couldn't be shouted out loud, so he said, "Since you're asleep, I might as well tell you tomorrow morning. Don't forget to come find me early. There's a one-dollar deal to be made." Sister Hu called out, "Brother Ji, slow down," kneeling on the bed and frantically grabbing for clothes. She said anxiously, "Where did my clothes go? Who took them? Brother Ji, wait a moment, I'll be right there. Oh! These are pants. I thought I was wearing a jacket. No wonder I couldn't put it on. Brother Ji, wait a while, I'll be right there." She spoke softly anxiously, and called out to people loudly, busy for quite a while. (79)</p>

<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>One day, I followed a friend to a certain exchange to sightsee.</p>
<p>In the market, the crowd was so dense that I don't have adequate words to describe it. In this crowd, people were constantly pushing and shoving. Alas, those who were pushed and shoved could only use the momentum to support their bodies against the chests and backs of the people in front, behind, or on the sides, causing those people to be pushed and shoved in another direction. Although you want to use the strength in your legs to support your body in a more stable position, it is hopeless. Fortunately, those who squeeze and shove you are also being squeezed and shoved by others, and at the same time, although you are being squeezed and shoved, you can also squeeze and shove others with force. Fortunately, in this place, squeezing and shoving is not a big deal.</p>
<p>Dozens of so-called brokers' agents were jumping, hopping, gesturing, and constantly shouting "[Two jiao]," "[Three jiao]," "[Four jiao]." Originally, the trading market was full of a crazy atmosphere, and these jumping and hopping agents were even more fully expressing a crazy state. But after these agents went crazy once, the market price changed. Then a terrible commotion immediately broke out in the market. You desperately squeeze me, and I desperately shove you. The victors laugh heartily, and the losers stamp their feet and puff out their chests. The original face of humanity is completely revealed here.</p>
<p>I still don't believe that in this atmosphere of pushing and shoving, jumping and hopping, and noisy shouting, one can go from rags to riches, or from riches to rags. But in the market, everyone is anesthetized and goes crazy.</p>

<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>[Relying on two lips, without real ability. Speaking flowery words. Deceiving people to get copper coins.] This is the ironclad annotation of "Jianghu Secrets."</p>
<p>A crowd of people surrounded the square. A friend of Jia Quan's demonstrated several sets of fancy boxing, which made the onlookers clap and cheer. Then he took out a plate of plasters, saying they were a secret passed down through generations, and no matter what the injury, one plaster would heal it. The onlookers were moved by his words and were willing to take out money to buy a few to keep for future use. If you ask if the plaster is really effective: that is only [Heaven knows, Earth knows, and I myself know].</p>
<p>A square table, a few long benches, and the fortune-teller sat in a dignified manner. As soon as he saw someone walking by wearing nice clothes, he would say: [Your Excellency has smooth sailing before you, and ten years of good luck to follow;] when he saw someone walking by looking haggard, he would say: [Your Excellency is suffering some troubles now, but you will definitely rise to the top in the future.] People saw that his words were quite accurate, and after a moment's pause, they would invite you in to discuss your life in detail. This is called [Binding Immortal Rope]. Once he releases it, no matter how clever you are, you can't escape the hook. You sit down to examine your fate in detail. He says a lot of words, but they are neither painful nor itchy, neither near nor far. As for how much the price is, it depends on whether your clothes are beautiful or not.</p>
<p>Shaking a string of bells in his hand, shouting [Specially cures all kinds of difficult and complicated diseases]. As soon as a sick person invites him in, he doesn't care what the disease is, he keeps shouting [This disease is dangerous and must be treated quickly]. After a series of frightening words, the sick person becomes anxious. Then he exaggerates his own experience and says [The doctor has the heart to cut his own thigh, I will definitely do my best to treat you; the consultation fee doesn't matter; the medicine is precious, please pay a few tenths first.] You give him the money, and he gives you a few doses of powdered medicine. He doesn't even know what it is, but when he talks about it, it's always precious medicines such as pearl powder and rhinoceros horn. If the disease is cured, he will come back for the money; if it is eaten badly, he will not be responsible. If someone invites him, there is really the possibility of [turning a small disease into a big disease; and ensuring that a big disease leads to the end].</p>
<p>A monk with deep virtue and high practice enters the door to see you. Saying [Someone in your family has been sick recently: someone's speculation is unfavorable] It's as if he saw it with his own eyes, without the slightest error. Then he said [Sickness is caused by vengeful ghosts: financial loss is due to unfavorable years, only if this poor monk performs some rituals of appeasement can it turn bad luck into good luck and turn misfortune into auspiciousness.] The host suspected that a living immortal had descended, and followed his words, worshiping the stars and paying homage to the Dipper, chanting mantras completely. A lot of copper coins were spent, but no effect was seen. However, the maid or driver in the host's house had already gone to the monk to get a kickback.</p>

<p>Cigarettes can be considered the only companion for lonely people. When you feel extremely bored and extremely depressed in your heart, and you can't get rid of it, just light a cigarette, lie down on the sofa and smoke it slowly; looking up at the circles and layers of silver-gray smoke, which turn into a dragon colt, winding and twisting upward, lingering on the ceiling, and finally disappearing into the void. How fascinated you should feel! Just now, your depressed and bored mood was unknowingly destroyed without a trace in this fleeting, fleeting process of transformation.</p>
<p>In the past, I could really be said to be a loyal comrade of the [Non-Smoking Society]. At that time, I hated cigarettes like enemies, especially those who smoked, and I held a sense of loathing. Whether it was in a carriage or in a small room, when I smelled the cigarette smell coming from other people's mouths into my nostrils, or the smoke floated to my face, I felt like I had been infected with some kind of evil disease, and I immediately wanted to jump up in anger. Now, I myself have become the person I used to hate and am close to the things I used to hate. Now, almost every day, every hour, I have to smoke a few cigarettes. I have to smoke when I work and study, and I also have to smoke when I rest; otherwise, I will feel uncomfortable. In this way, between me and cigarettes, it is clear that an inextricable bond has been formed.</p>
<p>Why did I suddenly develop such a strong feeling with cigarettes? The reason is very simple, I am very lonely, I need comfort!</p>

<h3 id="e171">Miner's Life <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>There was a time when people were dreaming of a golden dream, that is, [Go to Nanyang to dig up a gold mine,] Every year, quite a few people are drawn in to work as miners by this tempting saying, but who has seen a miner dig up a gold mine and return? Some are forever imprisoned on the mine mountain doing hard labor, and some are drained of their blood and sweat, and even their bones are buried in the mine! In recent years, the entire world has fallen into a depression, and that golden South Island is no exception, and the treatment of miners is even more cruel!</p>
<p>It is rare to have a few clear days on the mine mountain, and it is always so gloomy, filled with a humid atmosphere. Every day, early in the morning before the east is bright, a few mine police come blowing whistles, and this sharp sound wakes up the miners lying next to the furnace, and they quickly prop up their tired bodies that have not had enough rest, hastily wipe their faces, eat a few pieces of coarse and dirty noodles, carry a burlap bag on their backs, and carry a pickaxe and magnesium lamp, and hurry out of the house. Under the supervision of the mine police, everyone lined up in a neat row and dragged their heavy steps to work. The mine police looked very fierce, armed all over, with bayonets and wooden-cased guns stuck in their waists, and long guns on their backs. Their eyes were frighteningly fixed on every worker. If they walked slower or chatted with their companions, the hard gun barrel would hit their backs and legs hard. But they can't shout in pain, otherwise, the gun barrel will hit them continuously.</p>
<p>If it is a newly arrived miner, for fear that he will not be able to endure the hardship and escape, he must also be nailed with a pair of thick shackles, which resonate when walking, causing great pain, but once he enters the mine to work, there is no way to resist! And he can't even think about escaping. Mine police are monitoring him from all directions. If he slips, the bullet has already penetrated his head! It is not until five years later that the shackles are removed. By that time, he has been worn down to obedience, and he has gotten used to the life and will not think about escaping, but when he walks, he always waddles in an eight-character pattern, and the brand of the shackles can never be erased!</p>
<p>The mine is deeply buried underground, and the workers have to crawl into the cave with their backs bent; the inside is so dark and humid, so they light up the magnesium lamp and crawl slowly, and wisps of foul smoke spread out, making the turbid air exceptionally suffocating, making everyone unable to breathe. It is not easy to crawl to the place of work, (this place is a little higher and wider.) People then place the magnesium lamp and use all their strength to swing the pickaxe, knocking down pieces of ore and putting them into burlap bags. When they are full, they carry them on their shoulders and crawl out of the cave step by step. The second batch of people will take over and crawl in. This rotation continues until dusk, and people drag their tired bodies back to eat dinner, rest for a while, and then rush to do night work.</p>
<p>Every day, they only eat a meal of brown rice, some salted radish, green vegetables, and soybeans are the unchanging side dishes. The miners all wear copper plates engraved with numbers, and they call each other by numbers. Their names have been forgotten. Working in the mine, everyone is worried about the danger of blasting and flooding. Once this unfortunate incident occurs, people can only close their eyes and wait for death. There is nothing they can do! But the mine owners seem to have no pity for this. If a large number of people die, there will be another large number of workers rushing to fill the vacancies!</p>
<p>The life of a miner is always dark and painful, and the gloomy mine does not know how many skeletons dreaming of golden dreams are buried, but only the mine owner with a bulging belly is fed!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of us closed our eyes. The expression on her face clearly told us that the emperors of these two generations really could no longer have any real and sincere image of the Empress Dowager because the years were too far apart. She just treated them like gods and Buddhas in temples, casually fabricating some far-fetched myths for them. However, the relics piled up in this hall are really not few: a large part of them are the robes they wore, piled up in several boxes of various colors, like the costume boxes used by opera troupes; there are also many rings inlaid with precious jade or pearls that they wore during their lives, all contained in glass boxes; and there are also many bowls and dishes, which are said to be the utensils of these two deceased emperors. Although these things are all very ordinary, and not very valuable in terms of value, they can indeed have the power to make future generations have some thoughts of seeing things and thinking about people when used as souvenirs.</p>
<p>These four palaces are connected, and as we walked through them all the way, we have probably walked halfway and have reached the place where Emperor Qianlong's relics are stored. We know the most about Emperor Qianlong's life, and compared to all the relics left by the emperors of the past in these four halls, Emperor Qianlong's part is naturally the most glorious. Therefore, we all have a special sense of importance and plan to carefully appreciate the things left by this incomparably wise emperor, which are enough to add a lot of glory to these old palaces.</p>
<p>He has many relics, and the most eye-catching among them is a large oil painting hanging on the central wall, which depicts Emperor Qianlong's portrait. (189)</p>

<h3 id="e173">Agricultural Extension Problems <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Kutong</p>
<p>The term "agricultural extension," as I recall, has only been commonly used in our country for about ten years. As for its meaning, depending on individual subjectivity, it can be broad or narrow. However, a common understanding is that agricultural extension is a means of improving agriculture, which is a narrow interpretation. If the implementation of agricultural policy is seen as agricultural extension, then it is a broad interpretation. On March 29th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Interior jointly announced the [Revised Agricultural Extension Regulations] (the original [Agricultural Extension Regulations] were promulgated and implemented in May of the 18th year). Article 1 states: [The National Government, in order to popularize agricultural science knowledge, enhance farmers' skills, improve agricultural production methods, improve rural organization, farmers' lives, and promote farmer cooperation, shall implement agricultural extension in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.] According to this provision, it is self-evident that it belongs to the broad interpretation of agricultural extension. Which of the broad and narrow interpretations is appropriate? There is much to discuss. However, this is not what this article intends to explore, and the focus of the extension problem is not here, so I will leave it aside for now.</p>
<p>Whether agricultural extension is practiced in a broad or narrow sense, in my opinion, the main premises are nothing more than: (1) What is there to extend? (2) In what time and space should extension work be carried out? (3) How can practical results be achieved? I think these are very important issues that should be discussed. In other words, one concerns the material to be extended; the second concerns the environment for extension; and the third concerns the technology of extension. Now, I will briefly state my personal opinions on these three items below.</p>
<p>As far as I know, in agricultural extension, there is often a rush to promote things without asking whether the goods are reliable or whether there is a need for them, which is a dangerous behavior. Why do I say this?</p>
<p>Everyone understands that agriculture in our country must be improved. It is reasonable and appropriate to use extension activities to achieve agricultural improvement. However, if one only pursues the good name of extension and engages in advertising-style exaggeration without first examining one's own goods, that is, without first reviewing whether the things used for extension are genuine and needed in the field of agriculture, then the result will be a great sacrifice. Not only will it fail to achieve the purpose of agricultural improvement, but it will also arouse resentment and rejection from farmers, affecting other extension work and the implementation of all agricultural policies. Therefore, in addition to considering various objective conditions, the things used for extension must first undergo a considerable period of research and experimentation to determine the authenticity of the extension materials before they can be extended and widely adopted, achieving practical results. Therefore, extension and research are closely related, and research should not be based on short-term or localized results to immediately promote widely, which would backfire and obstruct the path of extension. For example, when promoting various improved seeds, one must first ask whether the improved seeds are indeed reliable and have universal suitability. If there is still doubt, they should not be promoted rashly to avoid sacrifice. Speaking of this, we often feel that the current agricultural research institutions and agricultural extension institutions in our country lack the function of connection and a unified consciousness. There is a situation where research is research and extension is extension, which is an event that urgently needs to be improved. In other words, extension institutions should take materials from research institutions and obtain genuine and reliable goods; and research institutions should consult extension institutions to determine the steps of research. Only by advancing together can the effect of improvement be achieved.</p>
<p>Agriculture is subject to the limitations of time and place, that is, its seasonality and locality have a significant effect. It is a simple and obvious principle that agricultural improvement must first examine these two characteristics and find ways to adapt to or overcome them, so I won't say much. However, in fact, there are those who carry out extension work regardless of everything. For example, promoting cotton seeds in non-cotton-producing areas is a futile effort. Moreover, in addition to the natural conditions of time and place that should be investigated, the economic and social conditions have a controlling force on agriculture that cannot be ignored. For example, in the midst of extreme decline in the silk economy, promoting mulberry cultivation is also a futile effort. In short, extension should not be based entirely on subjective views but should take the objective environment of agriculture as a premise, with careful planning and long-term consideration, to avoid sacrifice, which is the right way to do things. Some people who specialize in agricultural natural sciences often deny or do not understand economic and social conditions and seek to promote their research results, which is a scientific game. Chinese agriculture has already become an integral part of world agriculture, and the news of its rise and fall is becoming increasingly complex. It would be extremely ridiculous to implement agricultural extension with eyes closed and doors shut!</p>
<p>The target of agricultural extension is mainly farmers. If farmers deny everything, then it cannot be extended, let alone widely adopted. Therefore, whether farmers can accept extension work is a major issue. Everyone knows that most farmers in our country are ignorant and conservative, selfish and stubborn, and always suspicious of new things and difficult to accept. However, this is not an absolutely unchangeable nature. If extension work can indeed bring benefits to farmers, why wouldn't they be happy to do it? As far as I know, some extension activities do not take into account the interests of farmers themselves, nor do they consider their economic power. They are merely embellished, exaggerated, or even deceptive and oppressive. Then, it is inevitable that farmers will feel resentment and reject them. Therefore, in my opinion, in addition to considering the two issues of the material to be extended and the environment for extension, the technical issues in the implementation of extension are also very important. This is a human issue and absolutely cannot be ignored. Having the things and getting the opportunity, it is also necessary to have good people to promote them, otherwise the goal will not be achieved, and bad results will be obtained. The organization of agricultural extension implementation is ultimately a human issue (of course, the funding issue cannot be ignored). It is best to have graduates from agricultural schools do extension work, but those who have become urbanized are not suitable. Those who only have knowledge from books and lack practical experience are also not suitable. Those who have no sympathy for farmers, despise rural life, and cannot endure hardship are especially unsuitable. In this way, it is not easy to find a group of suitable extension personnel. No matter how complete the upper-level organization of the extension agency is, if there is a lack of good roles in the lower-level work, then the so-called agricultural extension is only in name and inevitably becomes bureaucratic, and farmers are still indifferent to it. As for the training of extension personnel, it is not enough to simply instill knowledge from books or lectures on special topics for three or two months. I think it is best to train them in the rural areas, that is, to select some suitable agricultural school graduates and have experienced and advanced extension personnel lead them to the rural areas, completely living a rural life, doing practical training, and cultivating a group of extension personnel with honest qualities, diligent habits, accurate knowledge, and practical experience, and then let them take on the extension work of a certain village or a certain species. I believe that people trained in this way are much better than students who have just left school, and farmers will inevitably trust them more. However, such personnel must not work in isolation. On the one hand, they should be directed by the extension agency, and on the other hand, they should contact other agencies (such as district and township offices, rural elementary schools, etc.) to seek the welfare of farmers. Since their responsibilities are heavy and their work is tedious, they should be given generous treatment so that they can work hard with peace of mind and stay in their positions for a long time. With suitable people, various extension activities, such as breeding demonstrations, disease prevention, and all other agricultural improvement matters, can be carried out step by step and achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>Above, I have briefly stated the three issues of material, environment, and technology that I consider important in agricultural extension. These three issues are interconnected and can also be viewed separately. Only when the three are connected and suitable can the extension be successful. The reason why agricultural extension in various places cannot achieve good results is, of course, the lack of funding, which is a major reason, but it is also related to the three issues I mentioned above. Even if the funding is sufficient, the regulations are beautifully written, and the organization is well-equipped, if the three issues mentioned above are not fully resolved, agricultural extension will still not work, which is my personal prejudice. As for extension work, it should be carried out systematically and continuously, which goes without saying.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Review of the Japanese Silk Industry (Continued) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Wenqin</p>
<p>The success of the Japanese silk industry, while relying on the precision of trade and the excellence of manufacturing technology, is fundamentally based on sericulture. The extraordinary achievements of sericulture must be attributed to the popularity of education and the efforts of the political world. In recent years, our country has used various methods to persuade farmers to use scientific sericulture, but the results have not been significant, which is also suffering from a lack of education. Although the matter must be successful, it still needs time. Japanese silk factories, with past efforts, have removed almost all difficulties, unlike our country's factories, which are hindered by others everywhere. Since 1931, exporters have no longer been able to nitpick, and middlemen have saved much trouble in negotiations. Japanese silk sales must be inspected by the National Silk Inspection Institute, graded, certified, and delivered at market prices, without any dispute. Although exporters have argued that American customers cannot accept this system, the case has been implemented and there is no reason to change it. Recently, there has been talk of convening a silk grading committee in Tokyo to revise the silk grades. The attendees of this meeting include American users, Japanese exporters, silk manufacturers, and representatives of countries related to world silk.</p>
<p>In Japan, ordinary trade is open. For example, if a certain item is traded for a certain amount today, and who bought it, the newspaper will report it in detail the next day. Therefore, silk brokers (our country's brokers) must bring a detailed list of their goods to the exporters. If they agree to the transaction, they can sign the order and remove the item from the list to show that the transaction has been completed. Therefore, it is easy to see how much business is done in a day.</p>
<p>As for the purchase of raw materials, the cocoon price standard is determined by the government according to the market, and the price rises and falls according to the upper, middle, and lower grades. This is convenient for manufacturers to calculate costs. Japanese silk manufacturers regard the cocoon collection period as the life and death of their business, because all the raw materials they need for the entire period are selected during this short period. At that time, the host must pay attention to the market conditions in Yokohama and New York, and on the other hand, use his sensitive means to call his cocoon collectors and decide which cocoons are most profitable to purchase. The cocoon collectors regard the evaluators as important. Only experienced and deeply knowledgeable people can be competent, because the power of profit and loss is entirely in their hands. The Japanese silk industry attaches more importance to the [Hanging] number (Kaka is the i number) than our country's [Discount] when calculating costs, and it is more accurate. For example, if the standard cocoon price today is 3 yen for a silk content (Momer) of 12 percent, then it is known to be 25 [Hanging] (3 yen multiplied by 100 divided by 12). Then multiply by 16 (Japanese 16 kan equals 1 dan) to know that the raw material cost of each dan of silk is 400 yen. Adding a certain amount of reeling labor, the cost of each dan of silk can be obtained. According to this calculation, it will never change. If there is no hope of rising market conditions in the future, forward contracts can be sold in the exchange for a slight profit, and there is no need to worry about delivery. The method of calculating the cost is as follows:</p>
<p>3.  00×100</p>
<p>11=25 16×25=400</p>
<p>The declining value of silk is affected by the global recession, the decline in American consumption, and the competition of rayon, but the excessive development of Japanese silk, resulting in surplus production, is the root cause. If the silk-producing countries of the world cooperate to limit production in order to make production and consumption appropriate, the selling price may be higher. In the era of industrial and commercial warfare, it is a matter of survival. How can this be done? See the following figures. The difficulties of the Japanese silk industry are ten times greater than ours. In terms of production, 1932 was 40% more than 1923, but the value was 40% lower. The farmers or silk manufacturers bear this loss.</p>

<p>What we are paying attention to in Japanese silk and want to compete with is machine-made silk, that is, Japanese silk exports. Since 1929, the annual output has been more than 620,000 bales, while the United States' annual consumption is less than 600,000 bales. According to this calculation, the output of Japanese machine-made silk is enough to meet the annual needs of the United States, and it can also be transported to Europe for sale. Therefore, the oversupply of silk has already occurred five or six years ago. Unfortunately, at that time, our country's silk factory industry was in the golden age, and no one paid attention to it. In order to facilitate foreign trade, Japan has been devaluing the yen since 1931 and subsidizing exchange losses, so that silk exports can be unimpeded. The sufferer is that Chinese silk has since fallen into decline. I am saddened by the demise of Chinese silk, and I can't help but feel the vicissitudes of life for the Japanese. Looking at its increasing production and decreasing prices, I don't know how to remedy it.</p>

<p>In order to break this depressed silk industry, the Japanese have to find other methods to regulate it. Scholars and silk merchants are panicking all day long, researching and discussing the steps that have been taken: (1) Investigating the needs of various countries for silk goods, silk factories are equipped with silk machines, so the domestic consumption of factory silk has reached about 60,000 bales per year; (2) Reusing cocoons to make silk, dumping them in Southeast Asia, India, and other places; (3) Using cocoons to make artificial wool to reduce the import of Australian wool. According to the current production of spring cocoons, spring silkworms are 7% less than last year, and the new autumn cocoons are estimated to be 28.4% less; it is estimated that the Japanese silk output will be 100,000 bales less. (Note) In Table 3 of the previous review of the Japanese silk industry, under each year, two lines are listed, the numbers on the first line are the number of factories, and the numbers on the second line are the number of machines.</p>
<h3 id="e175">On the Current Relief of Our Country's Match Industry <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ren</p>
<p>In China, where light industry is still in its infancy, the match industry can be said to be a very important sector in manufacturing. There are over a hundred match factories nationwide, and hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly depend on it for their livelihoods. No matter how society evolves or undergoes changes, matches, since their invention in the 19th century, have maintained their inherent position in all applications. Furthermore, observing from various perspectives, the use of matches will become increasingly common, and social consumption will continue to increase. Although our country's match industry is constantly facing difficulties and cannot be described as deeply rooted, it undeniably has a long history. In the current stage of Chinese industry, everything is showing signs of decline, decay, and bankruptcy. The match industry is, of course, no exception and has helplessly entered its crisis. Internally, there is infighting among competitors; externally, there is the dumping of foreign goods, leading to decline and stagnation, increasingly becoming precarious. If efforts are not made to provide relief and gradually improve the situation, and establish a solid foundation for our country's nascent industry, then the match industry, which has a slight position in impoverished industries, will likely follow agriculture and cotton yarn and be on the verge of bankruptcy!</p>
<p>Upon investigation, our country's initial matches were all imported from foreign countries. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the Qing Dynasty, the matches used in our country were mostly imported from Europe. It wasn't until the 22nd year of Guangxu that Japanese matches began to be imported. The main export ports of Japan were Osaka and Kobe. The matches produced there were sold in the Northeast, North China, and along the Yangtze River, earning considerable profits for a time. Later, the Japanese, based on the Treaty of Shimonoseki, intensified their efforts and established factories in our country's treaty ports to manufacture. At that time, generally knowledgeable people in our country, considering the outflow of money and loss of rights, and because the scale of the match industry was relatively small and easier to operate, also gathered funds to establish factories. The first was the Juchang Match Company in Chongqing, Sichuan, making that company the pioneer of our country's match industry. Since then, match factories have been established in various provinces across the country, such as the Xiechang Match Company in Hankou, the Hefeng Match Company in Changsha, and the Xiechang Match Company in Shanghai. When the European War broke out and after the May Fourth Movement, the people rose up to resist Japanese goods and, recognizing the urgency of revitalizing industry and recovering rights, the establishment of domestic match factories surged like a spring after rain, seemingly replacing imported goods. That period can be said to be the golden age of the match industry. However, after this period, the situation deteriorated rapidly, becoming irreversible. The match factories with larger capital were still able to maintain some composure, while those with smaller capital were stretched to their limits, revealing their embarrassment. By the 22nd year of the Republic, more than ten small factories had been unable to maintain operations and had closed down.</p>
<p>The gradual decline of our country's match industry began in the 16th year of the Republic, and the situation was extremely precarious in the 17th and 18th years, seeming on the verge of collapse. By the 19th year of the Republic, the Xiechang, Zhonghua, Hongsheng, and Yusheng match factories began to merge, and after the establishment of the Greater China Match Company, market prices gradually rebounded, showing some signs of recovery for a time. By the end of the 20th year, all factories had profits. Therefore, in the 21st year, a considerable number of new match factories were established. According to people in the match industry, in the 21st year of the Republic, 92 domestic match trademarks were added, and 11 match factories were added. New factories were established in all major cities across the country, totaling over a hundred. The distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>Location Number of Factories Location Number of Factories Location Number of Factories Location Number of Factories Hunan One</p>
<p>Shandong Nineteen Guangdong Five Jilin Six Liaoning Five Jiangxi One</p>
<p>Jiangsu Nine Sichuan Nine Hebei Six Henan Four Guangxi One</p>
<p>Zhejiang Four Yunnan Four Shanxi Three Fujian Three Guizhou One</p>
<p>Shaanxi Two Gansu Two Anhui Two Hubei One Heilongjiang One</p>
<p>Among these hundred or so factories, the Greater China Match Company has the strongest capital and the largest scale. The company currently has a capital of two million yuan. Others such as the Jinan Zhenye Company, Qingdao Huabei Company, Macau Riri Company, Beiping Danhua Company, and Hangzhou Guanghua Company all have capital ranging from 200,000 to 1 million yuan. Among them, the output of Greater China is also the largest, producing about 10,000 boxes per month, 50 gross per box, and an annual output of about 6 million gross. Combined, all domestic factories can produce millions of boxes annually. However, according to expert estimates, the annual consumption of matches nationwide is no more than 600,000 to 700,000 boxes. Considering the production situation in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, the total match production from July of the 20th year to June of the 21st year was 562,000 boxes. From July of the 21st year to June of the 22nd year, it increased to 700,000 boxes. In one year, the total output of the seven provinces increased by 140,000 boxes, but the consumption of matches in the seven provinces has not increased so rapidly, resulting in an oversupply of matches. We already know that if demand exceeds supply, prices rise; if supply exceeds demand, prices fall. This is an immutable principle of economics. Therefore, the market price of matches has greatly declined. According to investigations, in March of the 21st year of the Republic, top-grade large-box matches were 59 yuan per box, second-grade medium-box matches were 50 yuan per box, and third-grade medium-box matches were 48 yuan per box. By July of the 22nd year, top-grade large-box matches had fallen to 47 yuan per box, second-grade medium-box matches had fallen to 38 yuan per box, and third-grade medium-box matches had fallen to 34 yuan per box, but sales still did not improve. Large factories were barely maintaining, and small factories with simple scales could not sustain operations and declared bankruptcy. Even those that had not declared bankruptcy were in great pain, either being acquired by foreign merchants or preparing to close down. Therefore, the current state of the match industry is extremely precarious, even worse than the precarious situation in the 17th and 18th years!</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the main reason why our country's match industry has been declining and becoming stagnant is that manufacturers have been producing in large quantities without limits, leading to overproduction and low market prices. However, the systematic dumping policies implemented by foreign match merchants, attempting to monopolize the match market and compete fiercely with Chinese match merchants, are also the main reason for the oversupply of Chinese matches. Tracing back to the Tongzhi and Guangxu years, European matches were the first to be imported into our country, followed by Japanese matches. After that, factories were established in China to manufacture. Since then, European matches have gradually decreased. When the European War broke out, the import of European matches into our country almost disappeared. Only after the end of the European War did European goods return to the East, but in small numbers. In the 8th year of the Republic, the import of Swedish matches into our country was only 2,960 taels of silver, but the increase was rapid and astonishing. Swedish matches accounted for the majority. The following lists the quantity and value of foreign match imports in the past ten years:</p>

<p>Observing these historical statistics of match imports, since the 12th year of the Republic, the increase has been rapid. In the 16th year of the Republic, it almost doubled compared to the 15th year. The highest was in the 19th year, reaching 3,664,061 taels of Customs silver. However, since the 20th year, match imports have greatly decreased, about one-third of the 19th year. This is because the new tax rate implemented in January of the 20th year, increasing tariffs, imposed a 40% tax rate on foreign matches, leading to a decrease in imports and lower numbers. This phenomenon, on the surface, seems to indicate that foreign goods imports have decreased, and Chinese match merchants have been able to rise. But the reality is not so. Foreign match merchants, seeing that the Chinese government has increased tariffs, and the cost of matches has inevitably risen, and that they would not profit from high selling prices, have improved shipping routes and shifted from importing matches to establishing factories in China to manufacture. This saves transportation costs and import tariffs. As a result, a considerable number of foreign merchants have established match factories in our country. In addition, foreign merchants have strong capital, excellent machinery, fast production, and high-quality products. In the 22nd year, foreign merchants accounted for 18.6% of the match production in Henan and Shandong, and 13.5% in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Their momentum is overwhelming. Furthermore, foreign merchants' match factories in China are subsidized by their governments. Therefore, although their products are excellent and far superior to Chinese matches, their selling prices are lower than Chinese matches. Foreign matches are about 4 or 5 yuan, or even 6 yuan cheaper per box. The average selling price per box is only about 40 yuan, almost a tenth cheaper. It is clear that they intend to monopolize the market and put Chinese match merchants to death. Chinese match merchants are at this critical juncture of survival. If they continue to procrastinate and do not seek relief, foreign match merchants will seize our country's market, and the road to bankruptcy for Chinese match merchants may not be far away.</p>
<p>Speaking of the relief of today's match industry, it is not an easy task. Externally, there are strong enemies; internally, there is infighting among competitors. Therefore, how to defeat this current strong enemy and how to avoid infighting among competitors are the two major issues in rescuing the match industry. If foreign matches can be defeated, domestic matches can rise. If infighting among competitors is avoided, they can work together in harmony to seek development. I believe that the way to relief is that, on the one hand, the government should strongly protect the industry; on the other hand, manufacturers must sincerely unite to stem the tide before it arrives. The methods of relief can be roughly divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Implement Anti-Dumping Taxes. For the sake of protecting industries, the state should levy severe tax rates on foreign matches. For those foreign merchants who establish factories in China to manufacture, all types of matches they produce must be registered, and the trademarks, quality, selling prices, etc., should be clearly stated. Any foreign matches that are sold cheaply below their cost should be subject to special anti-dumping taxes to protect domestic matches. Those who do not register and sell without authorization should be prohibited from selling nationwide.</p>
<p>(2) Restrict Foreign Merchants from Establishing Factories. Foreign merchants establishing factories in China to manufacture matches generally have three benefits: (A) They can hire cheap Chinese labor; (B) They can use cheap Chinese raw materials; (C) Once manufactured, they can sell locally, avoiding high tariffs, transportation costs, etc. Therefore, their products are cheap and of good quality, making it impossible for our country's match factories to compete. Therefore, strict restrictions should be imposed. However, the establishment of foreign match factories is based on the commercial treaties signed in the past, and the locations of the factories are mostly in concessions where our country's laws do not apply. Therefore, the implementation of this point is very difficult. However, it is necessary to promulgate and implement measures such as requiring match factories to register with our government. If, after strict review, it is found that there are various issues, our government should not approve it and prohibit its establishment.</p>
<p>(3) Reduce Import Taxes on Raw Materials. Although our country's match industry is constantly facing difficulties, it has made significant progress in recent years, such as the establishment of domestic Huachang match splint factories in Pudong, Shanghai. Therefore, most match raw materials can already be self-sufficient and do not need to rely on foreign countries. There are several types of match raw materials, such as red phosphorus, potassium chlorate, sulfur, and paraffin oil, which are not yet manufactured domestically. Therefore, the government should review the situation and reduce tax rates on the import of these necessary raw materials, and eliminate various handling fees to reduce costs, promote sales, and compete with foreign matches.</p>
<p>(4) Expand Markets. According to experts, our country can currently produce one million boxes of matches annually, but domestic consumption is only over 600,000 boxes, less than 700,000 boxes, resulting in an oversupply situation, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, to achieve a balance between production and sales, and match supply and demand, it is necessary to expand sales and develop overseas markets. The nearest place would be the Nanyang Islands. The Nanyang Islands are actually the destination for Swedish matches. The foreign matches that are popular in our country are also mostly Swedish matches. Therefore, Swedish matches have a hidden dominant position in the match industry. To compete with this powerful hegemon, it is necessary to improve quality and lower prices; otherwise, it may be ineffective.</p>
<p>(5) Improve Quality. Improving the quality of matches is the most important task for the match industry today. In the past, our country's matches were once sold in Manila, Philippines, but were not welcomed by the local people because (A) it was easy for the entire box of matches to ignite when striking one; (B) it was difficult to light; (C) the manufacture of matches was not good, the match sticks were easily broken, and the chemicals on the matches were not uniform, among other reasons. Recently, it has been heard that the products of the Greater China Match Company are being sold in the Nanyang area, and the future is promising, because the products of that factory have white match sticks, are neatly arranged, and are easy to light. It is hoped that other match factories in our country will also make great improvements to promote sales.</p>
<p>(6) Merge Small Factories. Although there are currently over a hundred match factories in our country, very few have capital of over 500,000 yuan, and even fewer have over 1 million yuan. Small factories lack thorough management, and costs are very high. Therefore, to achieve large-scale production, there must be large-scale match factories with strong capital and excellent products. Management will be less troublesome, and costs will be lower than if small factories operate independently. Therefore, domestic match factories with weak capital should be merged.</p>
<p>In summary, the above points can be obtained. Other measures, such as greatly promoting and encouraging the public to use domestic goods, can also be a method of relief. In short, at this time, time is pressing. If relief is not provided, our country's match industry will be on its last legs and completely ruined. Whether the relief can be effective depends entirely on whether the government can open a way out for domestic industries, and whether match merchants can unite in spirit and work together in harmony!</p>

<p>The financial market situation, since entering this month, due to the end of the general closing period, coupled with the forced temporary abandonment of export cash due to the general trend, the market situation has tended to ease. Yesterday was also Sunday, causing the overnight call loan rate to suddenly drop by 1.5%, changing to 0.2%. The transaction volume of call loan notes in the morning market was over 2.8 million yuan in transfers and over 300,000 yuan in new transactions. The afternoon market transaction volume was over 200,000 yuan. The transaction volume in the small general meeting was over 400,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e179">Last Week's Government Bonds on the Securities Exchange Rose and Fell with the Overnight Rate <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Market Was Closed on Wednesday Due to Settlement</p>
<p>January Futures Debuted on Thursday</p>
<p>The Market Prices of Near-Term and Far-Term Contracts Were Similar</p>
<p>The Transaction Volume Reached 10,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, from November 26th to December 1st, the Huashang Securities Exchange's November futures trading was suspended. The January futures trading began on the 29th. During the week, fluctuations were mostly affected by the high and low overnight rates. The environment was more stable than before. For example, the great success of suppressing bandits, the gradual consolidation of the situation in North China, and the exchange of envoys between the Central Government and the Southwest, making it not difficult to realize the grand reunion. The previous decline in the government bond market was entirely due to the tightness of credit. The outflow of cash is not just beginning now. The previous deposits in foreign banks were an intangible outflow, while the current shipments to foreign countries are a tangible outflow. As inflows are far exceeded by the large outflows, the outflow of cash is difficult to stop. However, the amount of cash being sent to the interior by the military recently to meet commercial needs is also very large. The Shanghai cash reserves are scarce, which is an undeniable fact. The decrease in cash increases the overnight rate, and too high an overnight rate obstructs the circulation of government bonds. Although this is the case, it is not serious and can be considered a temporary phenomenon. The future of the overnight rate is expected to ease, but it is difficult to recover, so market prices are not affected by this shock, and the prices fluctuate within a constrained range. During the week, the government bond market experienced large fluctuations. Initially, the price fell due to the gradual rise in the overnight rate and the increasing tightness of credit. Then, the price rose due to the slight easing of the overnight rate, the good environment, and the return of cash. The rapid changes were exhausting for both long and short positions. On Monday, the November contract had already been suspended, and there was no need to cover short positions urgently. The overnight rate was high again, and the bulls exited, causing the price to fall throughout the day, from a small amount of jiao to 1.2 yuan. On Tuesday, the overnight rate was high again, and number 11 was frantically expensive, while number 4 slightly covered short positions. The market price was slightly chaotic, with high and low prices intermingling, ranging from 2 to 3 jiao. On Wednesday, the overnight rate was the highest at 0.4%, but trading was suspended for the settlement of October futures. On Thursday, the overnight rate did not move, and January futures trading began. Many far-term contracts were bought, and there was a rumor that HSBC was returning cash, boosting confidence. This was also a reaction to the recent weakening market. After an initial fall, the market price rebounded sharply, rising sharply from several jiao to 1.5 yuan. Numbers 50 and 53 were very aggressive in buying. On Friday, the overnight rate stabilized and gradually eased, and the price rose again by 1 to 2 jiao to 0.7 jiao. On Saturday, the market stabilized, and although the overnight rate slightly eased, most of the buying orders were satisfied, and the market transactions decreased, with prices slightly better by 2 to 3 jiao. However, there was a sudden rumor that number 96 would not be paid, which was an unreasonable rumor and not worth laughing at. Therefore, number 96 alone fell by 0.6 jiao. The market situation was such that the far-term prices were almost the same as the near-term prices, which shows that new long positions were increasing in the far-term contracts. With such high interest rates, arbitrage is not possible, which indicates the tightness of credit. The spot market may ease, but the overnight rate may ease or rise. Therefore, the price cannot fall due to the current situation, and the price is constrained by the overnight rate, so it may hover. The number of storage is estimated to be about 6.6 million, mostly held by large short positions. There are many scattered small long positions. The short positions are held by numbers 16, 21, 23, 33, 38, 43, and 78, totaling 3.6 million, and the long positions are held by numbers 3, 9, 14, and 35, totaling 1.6 million, with the rest scattered among various accounts. The week's market price resulted in a slight increase of several jiao, except for number 96, which fell by 7.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was 10,000,005,600 yuan, and 10 shares of stock.</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Qin Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, went to Europe to investigate the judicial systems of various countries. Upon returning to China the other day, he submitted a written opinion to the government on improving China's judicial system. His suggestions, totaling nine items, all hit the nail on the head, and the pilot implementation of a jury system is one of them.</p>
<p>Qin stated: [The jury system originated in England and has been promoted in European and American countries. Its function is, on the one hand, to assist the court in investigating matters, reducing the labor of judges, and on the other hand, to prevent judges from overstepping their authority and indiscriminately detaining the innocent, thereby protecting the freedom of the people...]</p>
<p>After carefully reading the above text, the importance of the jury system is self-evident. The responsibilities of jurors can be summarized into two points: (1) to assist the court in investigating matters, and (2) to prevent judges from overstepping their authority. Excellent words! Every word hits the mark. Speaking as a medical professional, I would like to discuss the reasons why a jury system must be implemented in medical cases.</p>
<p>Recently, medical disputes have been increasing day by day, with a momentum that is surging and unstoppable. The courts handling these cases and the accused doctors recognize that medicine is a highly specialized field that cannot be fully judged by ordinary legal provisions. Therefore, they often request formal medical institutions in the country to provide academic assessments of the case's circumstances. This type of assessment work is in line with Qin's statement of "assisting the court's investigation and reducing the labor of judges," which is the initial step towards a jury system. However, these written assessments are merely documentary evidence. It is uncertain whether judges will base their judgments solely on these documents. If the judge still adopts an arbitrary attitude, wouldn't this assessment work be in vain, and wouldn't the grievances of the medical community be difficult to eliminate? It must be understood that judges base 30-40% of their judgment on the reasons stated in the complaint, and 60-70% on the arguments presented in court. If the reasons in the complaint are sufficient, but the arguments in court are limited by eloquence, or the judge's questions fail to grasp the key points, then a loss is still unavoidable. Therefore, the jury of experts is of utmost importance. For the sake of upholding justice and redressing grievances, in addition to the written assessment from formal medical institutions, we should further demand a jury. The qualifications of jurors should be scholars who are well-versed in medicine and also knowledgeable in law, so that they can assist the judge in areas where the judge's inquiry is insufficient and correct the judge's tendency to sympathize with either party. Only in this way can we achieve Qin's goal of "preventing judges from overstepping their authority and protecting the freedom of the people." I dare to briefly write down my views for the judicial and administrative authorities to consider!</p>
<h3 id="e184">A Discussion on the Health and Medical Situation in Huaiyin (Part 2) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Fangyou</p>
<p>(5) Old Medical Profession: Traditional Chinese medicine still holds a dominant position in today's society. In Huaiyin, excluding the rural areas, there are about 60 to 70 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners inside and outside the city. In the early years of the Republic of China, there was an organization called the Huaiyin Medical Research Association, with about 30 members. In 1924, it was reorganized into the Huaiyin Medical and Pharmaceutical Research Association, with the same number of members. Recently, stimulated by the regulations on the management of traditional Chinese medicine issued by the provincial government, they submitted a request to the Party headquarters to organize the Huaiyin National Medicine Association and are actively proceeding with it. It was officially established on the 23rd of this month, with about 60 members.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, there has been no official medical bureau for traditional Chinese medicine. In the early years of the Republic of China, local people raised funds to provide medical care and medicine at the Ci Yun Temple outside the city during the summer. Later, it was suspended due to lack of funds. In recent years, the Qingjiang Jisheng Branch has been extending medical treatment and medicine for three months every summer.</p>
<p>(6) Old Pharmaceutical Industry: Traditional Chinese medicine shops today will inevitably be eliminated on the one hand, but on the other hand, there are also aspects worth improving. There are about 20 traditional Chinese medicine shops inside and outside Huaiyin City. They are all stuck in their old ways, and even the process of preparing prescriptions according to the formulas may not be followed by everyone. If this continues, regression is a concern. It depends on the self-awareness of those in this industry.</p>
<p>The traditional Chinese medicine industry has the Huaiyin Pharmaceutical Industry Association, which is merged with the new pharmaceutical industry as a member of the Chamber of Commerce. However, it is recently rumored that it will merge with the newly established National Medicine Association. It is unknown whether this will be realized.</p>
<p>(7) Emerging Medical Institutions: 1. Kala-Azar Research Team. Kala-azar, commonly known as "痞塊病," has been spreading widely in northern Jiangsu in recent years. It is rampant in counties such as Huaiyin, Lianshui, Siyang, Guanyun, Donghai, Suqian, and Tongshan. Since the beginning of this spring, the Ministry of Health has specially sent Section Chief Yao Yongzheng, technician Huang Kegang from the Health Experiment Office, and specialist Dr. Vogel, a German professor from the University of Hamburg, Germany, to conduct on-site investigations in various counties in northern Jiangsu. They arrived in Huaiyin on January 13th and then went to various counties under Huai, Hai, and Xu, as well as Huaiyuan and Fengyang counties in Anhui Province, for a week of investigation. They returned to Beijing to report. After deliberation between the Ministry of Health and the Health Experiment Office, it was decided to establish an institution for the prevention and treatment of Kala-azar in Huaiyin. On the one hand, it will treat existing patients, and on the other hand, it will engage in academic research. Once the transmission route is determined, the area for promoting prevention and treatment work will be planned. The intention is very good. Therefore, in May, the Ministry of Health sent Section Chief Yao Yongzheng and Dr. Pu Nan'gu to Huaiyin to survey the site and prepare everything. It was officially announced on June 20th. The team is located at the former site of the People's Hospital, with the main entrance opening into the Provincial People's Education Center, occupying more than 20 rooms. Currently, Dr. Pu Nan'gu and Dr. Sun Zhirong serve as the director and deputy director, respectively, in charge of medical affairs. There are also assistants, nurses, staff, and servants, totaling about a dozen people. It is equipped with consultation, surgery, medication preparation, testing, animal, and refrigeration rooms. Because the team focuses on research and provides treatment as an adjunct, there are only six hospital beds available. Everything is free of charge. Outpatient service is held every other day, limited to six numbers each time, with a maximum of ten numbers, also completely free of charge. It is said that in the four months since its establishment, it has treated about 500 people. It is hoped that the team will continue to work hard in the future, expand its scope, and identify the transmission route of Kala-azar as soon as possible, so that prevention can be carried out skillfully. At the same time, we ask all parties to assist with funding and establish more free treatment institutions in the epidemic area of northern Jiangsu. The merit would be immense.</p>
<p>2. County-run Drug Addiction Treatment Center: The center began preparations at the beginning of this month. Xu Xianqing was appointed as the director by the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association. The center is located in the Qingjiangpu Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society. It is divided into consultation, medication preparation, convalescence, and testing rooms. Everything is still being arranged.</p>
<p>(8) Conclusion: The above is the recent health and medical situation in Huaiyin. There is no progress to speak of. Fortunately, the current governor of Jiangsu Province values health matters quite highly. It is hoped that in the near future, there will be a comprehensive plan for health administration and medical undertakings in various places to promote them. The people of Huaiyin can also enjoy the benefits of the government's promotion of public health. I can't help but look forward to it.</p>
<h3 id="e185">A Medical Perspective on [A Married Man Committing Adultery] <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Baoqin</p>
<p>The preference for sons over daughters has been a long-standing practice in China for thousands of years, and it is also a common phenomenon in autocratic countries. Because power is held in the hands of one person, all regulations are naturally aimed at satisfying personal desires, treating women as toys or commodities, and depriving them of their rights almost entirely. The law even stipulates special punishments for women, pushing this to the extreme. Fortunately, since the establishment of the Republic, under the guidance of Sun Yat-sen, women have begun to see a glimmer of hope for restoring freedom. The principle of equality between men and women is enshrined in his will. Just as the revolution is about to be completed today, and men and women jointly bear the responsibility of the country in terms of rights and obligations, it is unexpected that this revision of legislation has produced something unexpected.</p>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan amended the draft Criminal Law, passing Article 221, Paragraph 2 "[Sexual intercourse with a woman under the age of fourteen shall be considered rape]" and Article 239 "[A married woman who commits adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year; the adulterer shall be subject to the same punishment]," how delighted and jubilant will those who specialize in playing with women be, shouting "Long live the legislators! Long live male rights!" They may think that they can indulge from now on, in brothels, doing whatever they want. If their wives advise them a little, they can raise their voices and say, "This is a right specially granted by national law. How can you interfere?"</p>
<p>On the surface, victory indeed belongs to men, but in reality, it is leading men down the path of all evils. It is tantamount to national legislation encouraging people to throw themselves into the net of the law and harm themselves.</p>
<p>People know that opium is enough to ruin the country and exterminate the race, and violators are all legal criminals. Therefore, the number of prisoners in prison today who violate opium laws is the largest. The legislators did not remove the law because there were many offenders. Why is it said that punishing [married men] will inevitably lead to many violators? In order to avoid the problem of prisons being overcrowded, they stop eating because they are choked, and fundamentally cancel the law. Is this acceptable? Today's prisons are almost entirely occupied by opium offenders; later arrivals will have no room to insert their feet, so the opium ban can also be abolished.</p>
<p>Lowering the age of rape for women is indeed a violation of women. The standard for female maturity is the onset of menstruation. China's land is vast, and due to climatic conditions, very few women under the age of fourteen have their period. How can a few represent the majority? Women who encounter this misfortune account for a very small percentage, while men who contract venereal diseases due to adultery are numerous. Their impact on personal health and the soundness of the nation is extremely great and significant.</p>
<p>I am a doctor, so I know more details. I have clearly indicated that I am a female doctor, and I have not written a venereal disease specialty, but according to the statistics of my clinical consultations, patients with venereal diseases among male and female patients account for more than 60% of the total number. In Chinese customs, it is natural for women to consult female doctors for diseases, but it is surprising for men with venereal diseases to seek treatment from me in the eyes of those without medical knowledge. Then those male doctors who specialize in venereal diseases must have crowded waiting rooms. Moreover, the disease statistics of the Nanjing Municipal Health Office also show that venereal diseases have the highest rate. It can be seen from this that the spread of venereal diseases is so wide that it can be said to have penetrated the people. How it is contracted, there is no need to elaborate. This is due to the lack of moral cultivation of individuals and the lack of interference from national law.</p>
<p>Observing each patient who comes, with a worried face, staggering gait, ashamed and remorseful, and timid speech, the hidden pain and unavailing repentance in their hearts can be imagined. Looking at the affected area, there is pus flowing from the urethra like a small channel, the foreskin is swollen and ulcerated, and urination is like stinging and burning, with fresh blood flowing down. Or frequent urination, dozens of times a day, involuntarily flowing out. Or blocked and impassable, the bladder is swollen, and it is difficult to drip down. Or the testicles are swollen and painful. Afterwards, they are often unable to bear children. Some even have swollen knees and cannot walk. All of this is the general outline of "gonorrhea." As for "syphilis," in the initial stage, sores or ulcers appear in the genital area. In the second stage, rashes appear all over the body, with headaches, bone pain, increased body temperature, and loss of appetite. In the third stage, it penetrates into the bone marrow or pierces the top of the head and nasal bones, expanding and ulcerating, with a foul odor, commonly known as "opening the skylight." Or it invades the spinal cord, and the legs and feet cannot move, becoming paralyzed. Or it enters the internal organs and becomes a tumor. Or it corrodes the blood vessel wall, forming an aneurysm, which ruptures suddenly, causing death in an instant; some even need to have their limbs sawn off. Or the blood vessels harden, easily leading to stroke. Or the heart valves corrode, becoming incomplete closure. Many internal and surgical diseases are caused by syphilis, which is beyond what ordinary people can imagine. In addition, there is "soft chancre," in addition to small ulcers in the genital area, there is also swelling of the inguinal lymph nodes, called buboes. At this time, the body feels cold and hot, with severe pain, making walking difficult, and its maturity and ulceration cannot be cured in a day or two. The symptoms, course, and complications of the above diseases are described in detail in special books. Today, I will only</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>speak of the general outline, so that the general public can know a little and be alert, because patients often cry bitterly and weep to the heavens and call out to their parents when they are in great pain after getting sick, but it is too late! Can the law protect them at this time? Can germs know that they are male and not attack them?</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately, it is transmitted to his wife, so his wife suffers this pain innocently. It also affects the offspring. After a woman contracts "gonorrhea," in addition to the urethra, the vagina is an important colony. At this time, if she gives birth to children, their eyes can be infected with gonococcus when passing through the birth canal, resulting in blindness. Ascending from the vagina to the uterus causes gonorrhea cervicitis, the pain of which need not be mentioned. After becoming chronic inflammation, although she can conceive, she is more likely to miscarry in the second or third month. Ascending further to become gonorrhea salpingitis is the main cause of only having two children or infertility after miscarriage. Infants born to syphilis patients often die young, or the fetus dies in the womb after seven or eight months of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The aforementioned all have a great relationship with the health of the race and the survival of the nation. Therefore, those who have a spouse and commit adultery are even more harmful. It is not only personal harm to the body and mind, waste of money, loss of reputation, impact on career, destruction of family happiness, and being spurned by society.</p>
<p>In addition, there are those who are often encountered in daily clinical consultations, that is, patients who ask doctors to perform induced abortions for them. This is naturally rejected by formal doctors, while general quacks and ignorant midwives are only interested in profit and use unscientific methods, and the deaths of women as a result are also reported in the newspapers every day. Other tragedies caused by adultery are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Today, some male legislators believe that only punishing women is to protect male rights and benefit men. They do not know that they are setting a trap to trap them and to trap the entire Chinese nation. If the law stipulates that those who have a spouse and commit adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment, then the general male, even if not out of fear of crime, will avoid it in order to avoid being dragged into court by his wife, and thus be restrained. As a result, the spread of venereal diseases will be greatly reduced invisibly, and the soundness of the race can be expected. How can some legislators have no medical knowledge and lack social vision to this extent?</p>

<p>(26) Diphtheria (Continued)</p>
<p>Speaking of the complications of throat diphtheria, they can be distinguished into two types: communicable and metastatic inflammation. Now I will talk about them roughly, as follows.</p>
<p>(A) Communicable inflammation: The main inflammations are three, as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Nasal Diphtheria: It usually starts with nasal congestion and vigorous secretions, initially serous, then bloody purulent (the most important point in diagnosing nasal diphtheria). The skin of the upper lip is red and swollen due to the irritation of the secretions flowing out of the nasal cavity. There is often a necrotic fragment that detaches from the inflamed nasal mucosa and is discharged outward. If a nasal speculum is used to examine the nasal cavity, a grayish-white linear necrotic tissue can be seen. Nasal diphtheria should never be taken lightly, because many children often die from systemic sepsis or prostration.</p>
<p>(2) Laryngeal Diphtheria: It is a serious complication caused by the spread of pharyngeal diphtheria to the larynx. It is most common in children. Its danger lies in the occurrence of acute laryngeal stenosis symptoms. If the treatment is improper or too late, most patients die from suffocation.</p>
<p>(3) Otitis Media: When the inflammation involves the middle ear, the patient feels severe pain in the ear, eventually suppurating, turning into a perforation of the eardrum, and even causing various symptoms or dangers.</p>
<p>(B) Metastatic Inflammation: Inflammation belonging to this category is all due to the action of diphtheria toxin. Its main inflammations are five, as follows.</p>
<p>1. Acute nephritis 丨 Most common.</p>
<p>2. The heart is also prone to disorders, and sometimes there is sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p>3. Lungs 丨 Pneumonia symptoms often occur.</p>
<p>4. Polyarthritis 丨 Induces painful swelling in the joints.</p>
<p>5. Skin changes 丨 Such as roseola-like or erythema-like rash, or skin bleeding. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e188">Common Treatment for Fever (10) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Helping Internal Excretion</p>
<p>I have already discussed the importance of helping the skin excrete during a fever. Besides helping the skin, assisting the kidneys in excretion is crucial. Many medications are unnecessary during a fever, except for diuretics. While increased urination cannot entirely eliminate the toxins produced by bacteria, it can help excrete a portion. We know that the urine of febrile patients is often concentrated and has a high specific gravity when the urine volume is low. Thick urine is harmful to the kidneys. Therefore, helping the kidneys excrete more, resulting in dilute urine with a lower specific gravity, protects the kidneys and prevents future nephritis. While there are many medications to help the kidneys excrete, sodium citrate is the most suitable for febrile patients. This medicine aids kidney excretion, thins phlegm, facilitates bowel movements, and increases the body's alkali reserve. We know that the body often has excessive acid during a fever. Increasing the alkali reserve neutralizes the acid, preventing it from causing harm. Maintaining a neutral blood pH is greatly beneficial to the body. This medicine does not impede digestion. However, it can sometimes cause nausea, so it is best taken by mixing one spoonful of the medicine with a glass of water or fruit juice. Lemon juice, orange juice, and grape juice are preferred.</p>
<p>Medication and Treatment of Fever</p>
<p>Reducing Pain: Common antipyretics are essentially anesthetics for fever. Water therapy for fever reduction is fundamentally different from medication. Water therapy reduces fever without diminishing the body's vitality and resistance. However, antipyretic medications reduce both fever and vitality, thus lowering resistance. Therefore, when the fever is exceptionally high, one should not rely solely on antipyretic drugs. These drugs are most useful for relieving headaches, body aches, calming nerves, and promoting sleep. Be careful not to take too much of these medicines. Too much can decrease resistance, cause excessive sweating, or lead to physical exhaustion. The primary goal of using these drugs is to reduce the patient's pain. It is also important to note that pain often occurs at the onset of the illness. Once the pain subsides, antipyretic medications should no longer be taken.</p>
<p>The names of such drugs are countless, with hundreds or thousands available on the market. Advertisements are everywhere. Many are foreign imports, and even more are manufactured domestically. Patients rarely inquire about the ingredients or efficacy of these medicines. I will briefly describe several commonly used antipyretic drugs for readers to study.</p>
<p>(1) Quinine-based Drugs: Most people now know that quinine can reduce fever. It does so by reducing the body's vitality, which in turn lowers the temperature. This drug can also reduce pain and calm nerves, so a small dose can sometimes help febrile patients sleep. It is clear that if a febrile patient does not have significant pain and their nerves are stable, this drug is unnecessary. Furthermore, because this drug reduces the body's ability to resist bacteria, it should not be taken in excess.</p>
<p>(2) Sodium Salicylate, Aspirin, etc.: These drugs are quite effective in reducing muscle and bone pain, joint pain, and headaches, but they should not be taken for extended periods or in excessive doses.</p>
<p>(3) Antipyrine-based Drugs: These drugs are derived from coal tar through analysis or synthesis. The most important ones include menthol, phenacetin, amidopyrine, and pyrimidone. There are many variations of these drugs on the market. While a small dose may be slightly beneficial for pain relief, it is crucial not to take too much. It has been proven that excessive use of these drugs is harmful. When sick with a fever and headache, it is essential to reduce the fever and relieve the headache, but do not forget that the ultimate goal is to restore the body to health quickly. It is unacceptable to reduce a small amount of pain at the expense of reducing the body's resistance, thereby increasing the severity of the illness. Painkillers primarily numb the nerves. The pain is still present, but the patient is unaware of it. It is better to endure some minor pain to allow the illness to resolve safely and quickly.</p>
<p>Emergency Treatment for Fainting</p>
<p>Every patient with a high fever has a chance of fainting. Those caring for them should not simply shed tears when they see the severity of the illness, but should think of ways to help them through the danger. To help them, one must understand their condition and needs. The primary crisis for a patient is circulatory arrest. Blood transports nutrients to all parts and cells of the body while also carrying waste products from these parts to the excretory organs. Just as the paralysis of all transportation in Shanghai would be disastrous, the arrest of circulation is a step toward death for a patient. Circulatory arrest is caused by toxins produced by bacteria that impair the function of the body's cells. Caregivers must know how to recognize the crisis, understand its symptoms, and then think of ways to prevent it and provide emergency treatment.</p>
<p>A lower degree of circulatory arrest causes fainting. A higher degree causes death. Circulatory arrest is primarily caused by the loss of vascular function and secondarily by heart failure. Some diseases, such as diphtheria, are particularly prone to causing heart failure, leading to fainting. In the case of fainting due to vascular dysfunction, the abdominal blood vessels first lose their contractility, causing blood to pool in the internal organs. The skin becomes pale and cold due to lack of blood, and the heart rate increases. As circulatory arrest worsens, the lips and fingertips turn purple, and the pulse becomes irregular, reaching a critical point.</p>
<p>Appropriate treatment includes: (1) Oral or injected cardiotonics, depending on the severity of the condition. (2) If the blood vessels have lost contractility, elevate or lower the foot of the bed to direct blood flow to the lower limbs or back to the upper body. Rub the lower limbs externally, moving the blood toward the feet. Bind the abdomen tightly with a cloth to reduce blood pooling in the abdominal organs. If the heart is failing, in addition to administering cardiotonics, help the patient sit up. If these methods are properly implemented, they can be very effective in bringing the patient back to life.</p>
<p>Recovery Period Care</p>
<p>The end of the fever does not mean the end of treatment. Another part of the treatment is also important. This part of the treatment is to quickly restore the patient to health and their original work. Proper treatment during this process leads to a faster recovery, while improper treatment can not only slow down recovery but also allow other diseases to take advantage. A weakened body is more vulnerable to severe illnesses, which often lead to unfavorable outcomes. Therefore, during the gradual recovery, appropriate treatment methods must be used. The first thing to note is that as the patient gradually recovers, they often feel stronger than they actually are, i.e., "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." They may feel strong, but they are not yet that strong. Therefore, one should not allow the patient to get up too quickly based on their feelings. A common rule to follow is that the number of days of bed rest (or recuperation) after a fever should equal the number of days of fever. For example, if the fever lasted for three days, bed rest should continue for three days after the fever subsides. For fevers that easily become chronic or lead to other illnesses, the recuperation period should be extended. For example, acute rheumatic fever or acute nephritis requires several weeks of bed rest after the fever subsides. Acute myocarditis or tuberculosis requires several months of bed rest after the fever stops. Diseases that can easily lead to other dangerous conditions during recovery, such as diphtheria and nephritis caused by scarlet fever, require several weeks of bed rest even after the patient appears to be no different from a healthy person. Why? Because the toxins from diphtheria can damage the heart, and getting up and moving too quickly after recovery can easily lead to heart failure, resulting in sudden death. Nephritis caused by scarlet fever can be difficult to treat if not handled carefully.</p>
<p>If daily temperature measurements still show a slight fever, special attention should be paid, and it should not be assumed that the patient is completely recovered. A slight fever indicates that there is still inflammation in the body or that another problem has arisen. In such cases, a doctor should be consulted for a thorough examination. Sometimes constipation after illness can also cause a slight fever, which will subside after a bowel movement. Sometimes the slight fever is due to stopping bed rest too early. Extending the bed rest can help the body recover quickly and completely.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (31) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>What does sputum examination involve? According to diagnostics, it includes macroscopic examination, microscopic examination, bacteriological examination, and chemical examination. Among these, chemical examination has a relatively small role in clinical practice. For example, the demonstration of proteins, which was once considered important, is no longer of great value. In pulmonary tuberculosis, except for the fibrotic type, where variations sometimes occur, sputum from the other types contains proteins. Therefore, it is not very helpful in diagnosing the disease. Our classification here includes: A. Macroscopic examination, B. Microscopic examination, and C. Examination for tubercle bacilli. We will now discuss these aspects in detail below.</p>
<p>A. Macroscopic Examination: It is important to understand that the sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis does not have any special macroscopic features that allow for a definitive diagnosis at first glance. It can only provide clues for further investigation. The types of sputum that should be distinguished include mucoid, mucoserous, mucopurulent, purely purulent, and nummular. Mucoid sputum usually disperses at the bottom of the container. The sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients is mostly mucoid or mucoserous and not very abundant. If cavities have formed, the sputum is usually mucopurulent. The mucus and pus are not very well mixed, unlike the sputum of patients with bronchitis or bronchiectasis. The mucus appears transparent, while the pus appears yellow or yellowish-green, making them easy to distinguish macroscopically. Sometimes, the pus appears as small scattered clumps within the mucus, or it may form larger masses, resulting in various forms such as linear, spherical, or coin-shaped. This is the origin of the terms "nummular sputum" and "coin-shaped sputum." Additionally, the presence of blood streaks in the sputum, or the presence of black streaks due to the inhalation of coal dust by city dwellers, which may even cause the entire sputum to turn dark gray, can also be observed with the naked eye. Although these are not specific characteristics of the disease, they are indirectly related to it.</p>
<p>B. Microscopic Examination: In the microscopic examination of this disease, the most important and specialized aspect is the presence or absence of tubercle bacilli. These require a staining procedure to be visible, which will be described in detail in the section below. As for unstained specimens, many findings can also be observed under the microscope. Among these, the most important in relation to this disease is the discovery of "elastic fibers." They may appear as individual fibers or as bundles and networks in the sputum. They may be straight or curved. The branching patterns of the network-like forms are very similar to lung tissue. Their presence is mostly evidence of lung tissue destruction and rarely originates from the bronchial wall. Although their presence in the sputum is not as definitive as the presence of tubercle bacilli in diagnosis, it is still very significant. In suspected cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, sometimes the chest examination does not yield much information. However, if elastic fibers are found in the sputum, the lingering doubts will immediately dissipate. We can at least say that the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis will not be far off.</p>
<p>Besides elastic fibers, other components visible under the microscope include mucus strands and globules, alveolar epithelial cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and amyloid bodies. All of these have a direct or indirect relationship with pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>When examining the sputum of people suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis, one thing must not be forgotten: to check for the presence of lung fluke eggs. This parasitic disease is almost unique to East Asia. After the parasite infests the human lungs, it causes various pathological changes. Its symptoms are very similar to those of pulmonary tuberculosis. In the early stages, the patient has a mild cough and expectorates thick, sticky sputum, which contains bright red spots. This is almost indistinguishable from the blood-streaked sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. As time goes on, the cough worsens, and the patient may even experience significant hemoptysis, as well as anemia and dyspnea. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis requires a complete sputum examination. The accurate identification of these two conditions (pulmonary tuberculosis and lung fluke infection) requires a complete sputum examination. This procedure may seem mundane, but it is crucial because the subsequent treatment strategies are entirely different. I hope that readers and patients will not take it lightly!</p>

<h3 id="e190">Starting from the Contradictions of Superstition Itself <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jian</p>
<p>We have done enough to break superstition.</p>
<p>In the past, we used popular lectures, standing on the position of natural science to break it, but the result was no success.</p>
<p>Even now, there are still many people with good intentions, and they are still doing this. For example, solar eclipse, they have long ago announced this event in the newspaper, saying that on a certain day, a certain hour, or even a certain minute, a solar eclipse will definitely be seen in a certain place; Or use extremely popular text to publish the reason of solar eclipse in the publications, hoping that the public can understand one by one. However, when it comes to the time of solar eclipse, the general public, they still have to knock their gongs, put their firecrackers; They are trying hard to save their precious moonlight.</p>
<p>Using natural science to break superstition is not only failed in these places. The biggest failure is that many of those natural science researchers are also superstitious themselves. For example, how many doctors of the Red Cross today do not believe in religion?</p>
<p>This is because; At first, people's superstition was of course due to the inability to control and understand nature; However, that was when society depended on nature. Later, with the advancement of scientific knowledge, people were able to use natural science and technology to dominate nature; This naturally reduces the superstition of the natural world for the general public who have knowledge. However, something that cannot be understood and cannot be controlled comes again; This thing is the society we live in. Social economic panic, as well as terrible wars and revolutions, have become things that we want to avoid but cannot avoid. Here, the source of modern superstition is hidden again. Even changing a method, breaking superstition from the position of social science, is not something that can be done by a superficial action. For example, in Hunan, we once saw thousands of farmers smash all temples and even schools in one go.</p>
<p>However, now, the newly built temples are more luxurious than before. For example, in Guangxi, when the National Revolutionary Army passed by, under the command of military leaders, all the temples were cleaned up. However, now, next to those broken temples without clay bodhisattvas, those farmers who ask for a good harvest and those patients who ask for medicine are still constantly praying and kneeling there [as if they were on it, as if they were on its left and right].</p>
<p>In modern times, [superstition] has completely become a social problem, not a natural problem. It is a problem that arises from the relationship between people, not a problem that arises from the relationship between people and nature. A few years ago, my grandfather died. I wanted not to do Taoist ritual, not to burn paper houses, not to look at Feng Shui, not to choose a date, but my relatives and even neighbors interfered with me. They said: [If you don't believe it, we want to believe it; Your grandfather's uneasiness after death will also affect our uneasiness. ] In the process of this matter, my superstition about nature has been broken; However, because of social relations, that is, my relationship with relatives and neighbors, I was finally succumbed.</p>
<p>Just persuading people to break superstition, this is already a social task. If people want to be superstitious, let them be superstitious, why do we have to persuade them to break it? The reason is that because we and they live in a society, there is a related reason.</p>
<p>For superstition, the most important thing is to see its material origin. In history, we can see; There is a certain kind of society, and there is a certain kind of superstition or religion corresponding to it. In China, we can also see now; In the countryside, the main hope of the general public is to harvest more grains from the land; Therefore, the most basic and most common god in the countryside is called [land]. In the city, the hope of the general public is to live in peace and work happily. They use the city god (or city pool) built with mud to protect their peace and happiness; Therefore, the most important and most common god in the city is called [City God]. Although the city god built with mud has now been demolished in some places, the general public's hope for a secure life and happy work has not yet been guaranteed; Therefore, the Bodhisattva [City God] can still exist widely. The public's hope for [City God] now is still hoping that he can [protect one side].</p>
<p>In short, superstition, it is also a world view: it has some of the same characteristics as any kind of religion and even any kind of philosophy: That is, an explanation of the world in a certain time and space. However, superstition, it is just the most primitive and most basic explanation of the world.</p>
<p>At present, in China, if we want to shoulder the task of breaking superstition; Or to advance a world view stagnating on superstition to a modern world view, we can only start from the material origins of society.</p>
<p>Every performance of superstition is a performance of contradiction: that is, on the one hand, it expresses belief in the spirit, and on the other hand, it expresses requirements for material things. If we want to break that kind of superstition in spiritual belief, unless we can satisfy their requirements materially. Whoever can satisfy the farmers' requirements for harvest is the one who can eliminate the [harvest] in the farmers' superstition; Whoever can satisfy the security of living and working for the citizens materially is the one who can fundamentally eliminate superstition in the city.</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Ulanhotoke Plain <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>Autumn, as soon as it arrives in Ulanhotoke, the weather gets cold. The plain is covered in golden colors, and the withered weeds lie dry and yellow on the ground. The northwest wind howls desperately, without stopping day or night, growing fiercer and fiercer. People and livestock alike, assaulted by the cold wind, tremble in their limbs, their agility and freedom completely stripped away by the storm. Everything is rigid and clumsy, as if the wind is deliberately coming to scour and punish the Ulanhotoke Plain.</p>
<p>People wear fur hats that cover their ears and faces, leaving only their eyes and snotty noses exposed. Although their mouths are hidden in the fur, they pull the hat strings down to their chins when out of the wind, and warm breaths are exhaled from their mouths.</p>
<p>Every morning, the old people kneel straight before the [Living Buddha], praying:</p>
<p>"Living Buddha, protect our livestock and give us warm sunshine!"</p>
<p>The biting cold wind is like a mad beast, howling fiercely across the bare Ulanhotoke Plain. Frozen clouds fly in the sky, and the sun, like a malnourished person, stares listlessly at the plain, the weeds, the livestock, the yurts, and the purple people.</p>
<p>The gurgling sound of the Tashinur River has long disappeared; everyone knows that the sound is hidden beneath a thin layer of ice.</p>
<p>The wind gets stronger every day, and the cold burns across the Ulanhotoke Plain, burning fiercely. It looks like it's about to snow. For the safety of their livestock, the people who graze on the Ulanhotoke Plain are forced to look for places that are "sheltered from the wind and facing the sun." The Ulanhotoke Plain has no mountains in front or ridges behind; the wind from the Gobi Desert sweeps over it without anything to block it. Everyone knows that if they stay here through the winter, the livestock will definitely be blown away by the storm. Maybe the flocks of sheep and even the tents will disappear in the howling wind.</p>
<p>"No matter what, we can't spend the winter in Ulanhotoke."</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>"Where should we go?"</p>
<p>The traces of experience flash back and forth in everyone's minds, and thought is like a rope tying together all the herders of Ulanhotoke.</p>
<p>Rehashing past experiences, fear immediately ripples around them, making them tremble. That terrible storm, it is the herders' only enemy; it deeply paints the herders' lives with tragic colors, these colors like sharp thorns, stabbing the plain, the livestock, the flocks of sheep, the old and young herders.</p>
<p>The old woman mutters to her son:</p>
<p>"It's going to snow! The wind is getting stronger and stronger. Why are you still dithering here instead of moving? Are you waiting for the wind to blow away my old bones?"</p>
<p>Women mutter to men, old people mutter to young people. To avoid unexpected dangers and disasters, who wouldn't want to leave this Ulanhotoke earlier?</p>
<p>However much they grumble, those who listen just listen. It's no use complaining a hundred times a day. Sometimes, when they get annoyed, they ride out to run a lap, to vent the depression in their hearts.</p>
<p>Not forgetting for a moment that the difficulty in moving lies in not being able to find a good place that is "sheltered from the wind and facing the sun."</p>
<p>Worry hangs on people's faces. No one believes that such a large group of people can't think of a sunny place.</p>
<p>One day, a savior falls to Ulanhotoke, that savior shines a crystal light in people's hearts: that is, old man Hailaklun returns from Kukutai and tells everyone:</p>
<p>"No one lives in Ilieshan over there."</p>
<p>Joy lights up the crowd, and beautiful hope leaps in everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>The wind howls, the sky flies with dust, people, livestock, flocks of sheep, begin to stir on the Ulanhotoke Plain.</p>

<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>A seagoing mail ship, floating on the sea like a small bird, is about to depart. A warning cry stimulates the eardrums of pedestrians. A thick fog permeates the sky, a vast expanse of white enveloping the sky, the water, and the land. On the pier, a crowd of people of different genders is packed together. The sea breeze hits the face like a sponge soaked in gasoline and covered in coal dust.</p>
<p>John and I are in a sampan, unable to make out each other's features clearly. We are both on guard against pickpockets. Experience tells us to be careful every second in the crowd. Losing belongings is a minor matter; perhaps even one's body might be pushed into the deep sea where the sky and water merge, disappearing like a grain of rice sinking into a pond. We gaze remotely at the floating island-like ship, its brilliant lights piercing through the dense fog.</p>
<p>No one can think of a topic to discuss; everyone's heart is as empty and vague as the thick fog. The emotions created in a flesh-and-blood environment spread like electricity among the parting crowd at this moment. I hear someone nearby kissing passionately, murmuring touching short sentences. I smell the pungent odor of machine oil on someone's clothes. Looking at John, I see him turned away, gazing longingly at the shore.</p>
<p>[Sir, would you like some soil?] I suddenly feel a hand tug at my sleeve. Immediately, I swat his hand away, thinking, how can there still be people dealing in illicit goods in a place like this?</p>
<p>[Sir,] the same voice continues, [This is soil from home, soil from home. In case you get homesick, mix it with water...]</p>
<p>I can't see the person's face clearly, but I see a hand offering a paper packet, a sparkling diamond shining on one of the fingers.</p>
<p>[If you are leaving your motherland, soil from home is even more useful.]</p>
<p>The merchant's tone is quite refined. I was about to reach out when a hand snatched the paper packet. Needless to say, that hand was John's. I am surprised that he is normally such a strong person, yet as he is about to step onto a soil layer of a different geological composition, he can't help but feel attached to his native soil.</p>
<p>[How much?] John asks.</p>
<p>[Whatever you like,] the man says.</p>
<p>[I have been selling this soil for twenty years, and I have never had any disputes over money!] …</p>
<p>I see the hand offering another paper packet, a sparkling diamond shining on one of the fingers. Could this sparkling thing be the price of twenty years? John casually takes out a whole sum of money from his pocket, trading for two thin white paper packets. The hand with the diamond then disappears. [Profiteering!] I sigh softly.</p>
<p>[No,] the other party objects, [This soil is useful. When I was little, going to school in the county, my mother would always give me a packet of soil every time I came back, saying lovingly, [If you get sick, add some white sugar and drink it with water!] One year I fell ill in the provincial capital, and my father specially brought me some soil to see me. Now, if my mother were still alive, she wouldn't forget to prepare it for me. My mother is gone, but I will never forget…]</p>
<p>He says softly, trickling like a fine, flowing spring. I can only listen.</p>
<p>The thick fog has not yet dissipated, and the sky and water remain connected in the vastness. We boarded the big ship together. Under the lights, I see that the young man's eyelids are a little red. Because the fog is too thick, the ship doesn't seem to be leaving for the time being. We see emotions of parting rolling everywhere, electric-like, a knowing ache. We become even more silent.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, I can't help but think—</p>
<p>This is the tangible and intangible heat of native soil! Our overseas Chinese, no matter where they go, are always thinking of their native soil! Especially at this time, at this time, people will remember their native soil even more.</p>
<p>I point to John. Look, the soil merchant with the diamond on his finger has appeared on the big ship again.</p>

<p>— (By Joseph Conrad) Translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>She obeyed him silently, listening patiently beside the wooden fence; her eyes looking downwards, working on her knitting. Redness appeared very slowly on the pale skin under her rather untidy, abundant red hair. Her father's hair was conspicuously red.</p>
<p>She had a plump figure; a tired, weary face. When Captain Hagberd boasted about the necessity and appropriateness of family, and the joys of the hearth, she only wore a slight smile on her lips. The happiness of her family, in the best ten years of her life, was limited to taking care of her father.</p>
<p>Crude shouts from the upstairs window often interrupted their conversation. She would immediately and leisurely put away her knitting or sewing. Meanwhile, this angry roar calling her name, continuing, would make the fishermen wandering on the seawall across the road turn their heads towards these two cottages. She would often slowly walk in through the front door, and after a moment, everything would be silent. Soon after, she would come out again, supporting a crude, unreasonable, bad-tempered, melancholic-faced man who looked like a hippopotamus.</p>
<p>He was a widowed shipbuilder, who had suddenly gone blind many years ago when his business was flourishing. He usually treated his daughter as if she were responsible for his incurable disease. People always heard him shouting hoarsely, as if cursing heaven, a situation he never noticed himself: he had enough money to provide him with ham and eggs every day. For this, he often thanked God in a boisterous voice, just as he cursed.</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd had a very bad impression of his tenant, and he even once said to Miss Bessant, [He's a real excessive fellow, my dear.]</p>
<p>That day, she was making a woolen livelihood, knitting a pair of socks for her father, who always hoped she could dutifully provide for his needs, but he hated woolen work. At that time, when she was knitting the heel, his eyes had to be fixed on the needles.</p>
<p>[Of course, this is not like having a son to plan for him,] Captain Hagberd went on vaguely. Girls, of course, don't need that much—hum—hum. They don't leave home, my dear.]</p>
<p>[Not necessarily,] Miss Bessant said quietly.</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd laughed knowingly amidst the upturned clods of earth. From his sailor's outfit, his weather-beaten face, and his beard like old Father Neptune, he looked like a deposed sea god, only his trident had been replaced with a shovel.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Society with a Monkish Mentality <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Pi</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that Yang Huazhao had become a monk in Mount Putuo's Luojia Mountain for three years, and Liu Yuchun is also a monk in Putuo's Jiulong Peng. However, although Yang and Liu have become monks in Putuo, their whereabouts are very secret, so no one recognizes them as survivors of military life.</p>
<p>Yang Huazhao was a famous general during the Qi-Lu War in 1924. Liu Yuchun was a valiant general who stubbornly resisted the Revolutionary Army while defending Wuchang in 1926. Now, Yang has become a monk in Putuo's Luojia Mountain, and Liu is a monk in Putuo's Jiulong Peng. These two were once demonic figures who killed without batting an eye. Now, they have both entered the empty gate of Buddhism, truly [laying down the butcher's knife and becoming a Buddha on the spot]. One cannot but say that these two heroes have awakened.</p>
<p>Let's set aside the merits and demerits of Yang and Liu in the past for now. But after all, these two are both capable and experienced warriors. In today's world of iron and blood, there is a great need for this kind of talent to defend the country and promote national spirit. Therefore, having two more monks in Mount Putuo is a direct loss to individuals and an indirect loss to the nation.</p>
<p>Becoming a monk is originally the last resort of a hero, and a hero is originally the incarnation of a monk. If there is a way out, one becomes a hero; if there is no way out, one becomes a monk. Looking at it historically, it is originally a very common thing. Becoming a monk is originally a way of passive living, but heroes are like this, and non-heroes are also like this. Although there are still few visible monks in society now, there are actually many invisible monks, because the mentality of society now is a monkish mentality.</p>
<p>For example, [suicide] is a monkish mentality, [indulging in wine and women] is also a monkish mentality. Handling affairs with [the mentality of holding a post for only five days] is a monkish mentality. [Enjoying today's wine today] is also a monkish mentality. Meeting a friend and always asking [How have you been passing the time lately?] is a monkish mentality. [Being a human being is really very boring] is also a monkish mentality. When this kind of thinking spreads, it becomes a passive society, a passive nation. If individuals are passive, then individuals have no hope. If society is passive, then society has no hope. If the nation is passive, then the nation has no hope.</p>
<p>The cultivation of a passive mentality in the people is nothing more than two paths: (1) being invaded by imperialists, making it impossible to turn over for a while; (2) having no way out due to the poor social and economic system. The so-called [not knowing what will happen tomorrow] and [not planning for a human life in the next life]. The cultivation of such a mentality is really the fundamental element of social depravity. [There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart], which is the most incurable thing.</p>
<p>I am not issuing this kind of argument because I feel sorry for Yang and Liu becoming monks. It is because Yang and Liu becoming monks made me feel that the passive state of society now is the same as the passive concepts of Yang and Liu in many ways, so I can't help but feel chills. As Yao Guangxiao's sister said to Guangxiao, [I have never seen a good person who couldn't become a monk.] Then Yang and Liu being able to become monks is still good. There are many friends who can't become monks but are still secular, who are even worse than monks.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Winter in the Capital <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Ran</p>
<p>Winter has driven the noble ladies from the bustling Zhuque Road back to their lonely boudoirs.</p>
<p>What's left are only the emaciated beggars. Hunger and cold, batch after batch, driven by the increasing speed of time, drive them out of their homes, out of the fields, wandering to the streets, wandering to the capital, usurping the red and green positions of the ladies, adorning the desolation of Zhuque Road.</p>
<p>Winter on Zhuque Road is an abandoned mistress; a patient with third-stage syphilis.</p>
<p>The 30th of May Park, First Park, Qinhuai River, Yuhuatai... These many scenic spots that once stirred the emotions of thousands of men and women, now, except for weekends, only occasionally have a few young students and a few couples, and no longer attract people's footprints.</p>
<p>Falling maple leaves, broken stems and residual branches are great poetic material for poets. But we only hear intermittent hibernating insects, playing the elegy of autumn mournfully among the withered branches and weeds.</p>
<p>National, Capital, Nanjing... These several cinemas, however, with the arrival of winter, have become particularly prosperous. The ladies and gentlemen, not born with bones that can endure the cold, dare not show their faces in the northwest wind, locked in their boudoirs all day, too bored, the most appropriate place to go is to the cinema. There, there are hot water radiators, the warm spring weather, spring seats, cracking a few pine nuts, talking about Elizabeth and Joan Blondell for a while, and a cold winter night will pass warmly. Moreover, the words romantic, mysterious, and exotic are flashing with bright eyes, staring at them, right?</p>
<p>Walking in here, the bosses can also give you a guaranteed satisfaction ticket! Because he can comply with</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>the [audience's]? demands, and even use the scissors himself to cut the film again after the film censorship committee has cut it once. In this way, he guarantees that you will never be disappointed!</p>
<p>Finally, the dark mouth of the demon opens wide, and people are thrown out like goods in a warehouse. Women lean softly like lazy cats on the shoulders of men, twisting their willow waists, get into a 1935 Chevrolet, and leave with a "wobble wobble." The smell of gasoline mixed with the smell of soil pounces on the noses of passers-by. How many people are stunned, dreaming the dream of the great Han Emperor Liu Bang--[Can I take his place?]</p>
<p>One thing is too anticlimactic, the capital city is so big, but there is not a single dance hall. The young masters who have gone abroad and drunk seawater are cursing all day long: [Nanjing, a winter in the desert!] The cinema films are too bad, the courtesans' performances in Confucius Temple are also not popular, and the Great World Amusement Park is even worse. Only: [Let's go to Shanghai!] So, on Saturday afternoons, the business of the first- and second-class Jinghu trains is especially good.</p>
<p>The [venerable gentlemen], whose beards are not even a handful long, wear a black coat, get on their private cars, clang, clang, pull up to the Confucius Temple, where there is a row of more than twenty teahouses facing south, such as Kuiguang Pavilion, Qifang Building, etc. Brew a pot of rain before the season, eat a few vegetable buns, bask in the warm sunlight, talk about a few anecdotes of the Six Dynasties, flip through the newly released opera newspaper, or play a game or two of Go. The biting winter wind doesn't bother them and quietly subsides.</p>
<p>The ban on prostitution is strict, and the lives of the small clerks are very dull. Go to Linfeng Pavilion and Xueyuan in Confucius Temple to listen to the courtesans sing, [Eyes on, hands off,] too boring, and even flying paper cages is now prohibited. Then, pick a colleague's house, call a [lover] over, sit on a stool, warm a stove, play thirty-six rounds of mahjong, and the winter night will not pass well? Fortunately, if you don't make a noise in your own home, the police will never come to bother you. Who doesn't know that even though these are just small clerks, who doesn't have a strong background?</p>
<p>But it's just hard for the shop assistants who make a living from business. When the northwest wind comes, it seems to blow away a lot of their business. From early morning, they are cold and until the evening. Most of the store equipment is still old-fashioned. The old northwest wind blows into the counter where the shop assistants are every day and night. Finally, they endure until the vertical door is closed, and take the day's bad luck to the Great World. Two cents for a small ocean ticket, buy one get one free, hook up with a [white silk], and make a riot for a while. Open a room? The winter check is tight, and couples are caught in the substation from time to time. It's a small matter to pay a few dollars in fines, but a night in [winter prison] is really hard to bear.</p>
<p>However, the most bitter is still their boss. Hanging a sign and propping up a storefront, it is not as good as in previous years. The recession makes them look worried and burdened with a lot of debt. How will they spend the New Year?</p>
<p>In winter in the capital, some people are hiding in greenhouses, and more people are wandering on the streets. Some are laughing happily, but more are sobbing secretly!</p>

<h3 id="e198">Call Me Uncle <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Yan</p>
<p>When I returned to my residence from the restaurant, the amah handed me a letter. She said it was sent by a villager and that he would be coming again later. I opened the letter, and it was written like this:</p>
<p>[Friend, if there is still a shadow of your friend from a few years ago lingering in your mind, and you would like to meet, then please come with the person delivering the letter.]</p>
<p>Such simple words, and without a signature, the mystery is really perplexing. I repeatedly identified the structure and brushstrokes of almost every word, examining them very carefully, but in the end, I was still at a loss.</p>
<p>After a while, the messenger arrived. So I asked him:</p>
<p>[Who told you to deliver this?]</p>
<p>[The young master told me to deliver it.]</p>
<p>[What is the young master's surname?]</p>
<p>[I don't know.]</p>
<p>So, I pondered for a while, and finally decided to go there.</p>
<p>On the road leading to Village B, I walked silently, trying my best to find clues. From the sentence structure, I determined that it came from Old Chen's handwriting, but immediately felt that it was not very accurate. In any case, Old Chen would never run to the countryside, and besides, the brushstrokes were so naive.</p>
<p>[Then who is it?] I asked myself secretly.</p>
<p>The villager walking in front, he turned his head from time to time to look at me. Perhaps he felt too strange, why was the guest behind him always looking at the ground?</p>
<p>Arriving at Village B, we also curved and turned through a few small alleys. Finally, next to an old house, on a newly built small building, from afar, I saw a woman leaning against the railing, looking towards me, and waving her hand incessantly. I also looked at her suspiciously.</p>
<p>Slowly approaching the small building, people were naturally seen very clearly, I nodded to her in surprise. I really didn't dream that I would meet her here, whom I hadn't seen for a long time, the person I once loved!</p>
<p>[Come in.] She smiled, then turned around and said loudly:</p>
<p>[The guest has arrived.]</p>
<p>I embraced a full heart of excitement, mixed with the aftertaste of that tragic parting at the time, and walked inside.</p>
<p>The stairs clattered noisily. She came down, followed by a strange man, holding a cute little child in his arms.</p>
<p>[I really didn't dream that we would have this meeting today,] she smiled slightly, then pointed to the stranger and said:</p>
<p>[This is my husband.] Then, from her husband's hands, she took the child and taught him to call me [Uncle.] The child shyly hid in her arms.</p>
<p>I watched silently without a word, what else could I say!</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Pleasure of Buying Old Books <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Overseas Student</p>
<p>The habit of buying books is good. However, sometimes it is not good; and some people are also not good. For example, when you are very poor, and even the problem of eating is difficult to solve, one day you pass a bookstore and see a newly printed book; and this new book happens to be the one you love to read, so you buy it with all you have. In this way, although you have the book, what about when your stomach gets hungry? Some people, in fact, their monthly income can only cover household expenses, and there is absolutely no extra money to buy books, but they still insist on going to bookstores, making their lives a problem; these examples all show that buying books is indeed a virtue, but it is not something everyone can do.</p>
<p>I am a person who likes to buy books. However, I am also distressed by not having so much money. The other day, I saw a new book, Soviet Literature, which had arrived at the Commercial Press. The content was very rich. I flipped through it for a long time, but because it was worth two and a half US dollars, I dared not buy it, and I really couldn't afford it. Chinese books, on the other hand, are much cheaper. For example, a translation of Ellis's [Shaw's Biography] only sells for two dollars. You can't say it's not cheap. Who knew that I didn't even have two dollars that day. So, in the end, I had to come out empty-handed!</p>
<p>However, books still have to be read after all. So I thought of the way to buy old books.</p>
<p>In fact, as recently as when the bookstores on Fourth Avenue were selling cheap books, it was very worthwhile to go and find a few books. Because, although the books had been out for a while, the copies were not very damaged; and the prices were all below half price. At that time, I spent half a day looking for many books that I wanted to buy but couldn't afford before. Taking the recent example, I bought Wilde's [The Picture of Dorian Gray] in a bookstore for nine cents; this is a famous aesthetic work that I have long wanted to see. The joy of taking this book back and reading it under the lamp is indescribable. There are many people in the world who love to read, and I hope they can all buy their favorite books.</p>

<p>The fourth month is clear and the rain is just clearing. The doors are deserted and I am heartbroken. Since ancient times, the world has been cold and warm. The life of a prostitute is only new for a short time. Before puberty, I touch people's hearts. Touching hands and feet and kissing. Fifteen or sixteen is when the flower first blooms. It's like the moon is especially bright in the middle of autumn. Seventeen and eighteen are loved by everyone. The lotus coming out of the water is fragrant and new. At the age of twenty, it is the willow in the third month of spring. The orioles keep weaving past the sparrows. There are many rich cars and horses in front of the door. The madam is like a treasure in the palm. It is clear and bright day and night. Playful young men come like clouds. A young master is just getting on his horse outside the door. And it is reported that the young master is coming early. Being close and loving each other, there is no end to how much false warmth. Now the flowers are withered and the moon has set. It's not as touching as it used to be. There are only desolate cars and horses in front of the door. The pearl in the palm has turned into dust. There is no one on the Cold Food Festival. The playful young men are nowhere to be seen. Where have the sad young men gone? The翩翩公子 is not coming. Who will love him? What false warmth is there? I feel so sad.</p>

<p>Opening Martial Episode Ten [Manifesting the Soul]</p>
<p>Wu Er's head is filled with heart. He hurriedly carried the bones back home. He prepared some yellow paper and ingots. Kneeling down in front of the spirit, he called out to his brother. You died unclearly. If someone harms you. I hope my brother will entrust me with a dream at midnight. Leaning on the mourning altar, he suddenly fell asleep. In his dream, he happened to see the soul. Yin wind gusts, chilling to the bone. I saw my brother with a dirty face, disheveled hair, and fresh blood dripping. He said that since separating from you, my virtuous brother, it was all because of the lustful woman Jinlian who had evil intentions. She actually had frequent contact with Ximen Qing. The hateful old woman Wang婆. She seduced the adulterer to plot. She obtained arsenic and forced me to swallow it. Today, my death is full of grievances. My anger is difficult to vent, and I have died unjustly. Call my virtuous brother. You listen. You must avenge your brother's grievances. Wu Song woke up and called for his brother. He disappeared with a gust of yin wind. He woke up just as it struck midnight.</p>
