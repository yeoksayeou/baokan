<h3>意南關係之前瞻與後顧廷</h3>
<p>今次南斯拉夫國王亞歷山大氏被刺於法之馬賽凶手爲一克羅特人而動機則聞爲報復南王壓迫克羅特族之自由世界輿論咸以爲馬賽慘案責任分明絶不能歸罪於外人卽素相仇視之意南二國當亦無何發生衝突之皇慮吾人昨日一評曾謂［假若南國内亂不起則表面上之國際糾紛或不難消弭於無形］猶此意也</p>
<p>然據最近傳來之電訊南斯拉夫民衆因痛心於其國王之慘死竟發生反意之暴動巨白爾迦那地方之示威民衆且聲稱此次暗殺亞歷山大王及本年三月間柴格里白暗殺案均得意國之資助而在意境籌劃者萊白區意匣領事館之一職員又爲羣衆所痛毆行將釀成二國政府之交涉吾人由此新發生之糾紛乃憶及本年九月間意南二國之關係亦曾瀕於非常惡化之處境意政府竟至召回其參加貝爾格勒國際議會商務聯合會之代表而南斯拉夫之一般輿論亦大舉排意不遺餘力意國外交部機關報提議與南國絶交以爲［二國之政體系統根本不相同如意大利與南斯拉夫者除向南斯　拉夫問罪外實無調和之可能］意政府本此立塲乃提出正式抗議要求南政府取締其國内排意之言論履霜堅冰其來也漸此次風潮固兩國宿隙之所造成者也</p>
<p>嘗考意南二國齟　之起源實緣立國政策之不同而種其惡因者則恊約國也早在一九一五年時意人已向恊約國獲得秘密之允諾以爲其參戰交換之條件其内容略謂一俟戰事平靖意國對於伊太利亞伊利滕太及達爾美梯亞亞爾培尼亞三處所抱之願望皆可一一實現換言之亞德里亞海可以一變而爲意大利私有之湖沼恊約國决不阻尼其行動戰事旣畢召開巴黎和會克利門梭勞合喬治二巨頭陰爲意助威爾遜氏初持反對之論意人則以退會爲要挾威氏爲實現國聯之組織計勉從其議和會乃任意國割據亞爾培尼亞之一部餘者則准視爲代管區域而操其實權嗣經亞人積極反抗其事始寢而意詩人鄧南遮復號召志士佔領亞德里亞海畔之阜姆埠建設一小共和國以爲羅馬之外府至一九二一年正月實行合併於意阜姆者一通商之要港本屬匃牙利南人則認爲有繼承之權利者也意人捷足先登未嘗不痛心疾首然以迫於實力無可奈何直至一九二四年羅馬公約成立南人始承認此合併之事實惟同時意人亦承認爲聖日耳曼底里亞農與夫紐意蘭三種和約作担保以間接維持南斯拉夫在和約下之權利</p>
<p>南王亞歷山大之政策固以抗意爲骨幹者也言其方熆一則在圑結巴爾幹之内部二則二在聯絡法德之勢力就前者言如本年與羅馬尼亞希臘土耳其訂結巴爾幹公約二次訪問保加利亞王美滿以歸皆其顯著之成績就後者言如迎合德國以抵抗意人在奥匈之勢力交歡法人以重修凡爾賽統系組織份子間之舊好亦其具體之表現此次赴法報聘抱負至宏言其最大用意則仍不外乎擺脫意人之壓力以爲自强之地耳無怪乎墨索里尼氏最近在米蘭演說一方固表示其與南人和平轉圖之誠意一方則仍謂［如報載之消息果確南斯拉夫繼續損傷意國而使痛入内心則意南兩國之關係絶無改善之可能］也。</p>

<p>蘇俄名記者拉狄克</p>
<h3>論馬賽慘案</h3>
<p>莫斯科拉狄克著文［馬賽槍殺案］載伊斯維斯太報、他說［巴爾都和南斯拉夫國王的被刺、重新證明和平的根基是何等不穩、同時有多少種力量正想摧折目下歐洲這種不穩定的均勢、］拉狄克分析南斯拉夫的政局、指明南國對於一切反政府運動的横加迫害、一時也許能將國民的各種運動、盡加消滅、不是南國境内的恐佈圑體却未能肅淸、同時這些圑體却得到那些存心削弱南斯拉夫的列强的情報部的奥援、因此肅淸的工作格外做不成了、而馬賽的慘案顯然是一個屬於此類的圑體所做的工作、</p>
<p>拉狄克再詳細地論及法南兩國同盟這一所大厦上的裂痕、論及毁壞法羅（馬尼亞）同盟的活動、以及法國對於其波蘭同盟國所遭遇的困難、他又說［在法國同盟　系統之下的幾個國家、雖然情勢的邏輯要求它們執行防衛和平的政策、並且要求齊心合力來從事這個防衛工作、可是各國國内的經濟情勢、以未解决的農業問題、以及民族間的對立、處處在摧毁政府的穩定、並且造成各種各式冒險行動的根據、而上述種種困難、就從這裏産生、</p>
<p>［德國法西主義的報紙、經常地向法國指出這些困難、正像它早已瞧見這番馬賽事件中［上帝的手指］一樣、德國自身是一個充滿着遍尋出路的蒸汽的鍋爐、這種蒸氣會令、鍋爐爆裂、假如德國努力要把多瑙河和巴爾幹各國一口吞下、或者竟能成功、那末它必然會接見它的許多新朋友、這些朋友原有的各種矛盾還是遺留着、德國在治療巴爾幹各國病症的時候、比起别的資本主義來不見得有更好的藥方、］</p>
<p>拉狄克繼續說［巴爾都已在馬賽死去了、他不僅是一個出色的演說家和偉大的外交家、而且是一個具有闊達的歷史見解的人、生命已經證實蘇維埃政權的强固和隆盛、並且已經打毁了巴爾都的偏見、使他面對着這樣的一個眞理、革命的犁在以前沙皇的國土上所完成的事業、已經最後地完成了、而且再没有向後退拉的路、一個偉大的歷史學家所把握着的事實、就變成當作外交家的巴爾都一切行動的根源、巴爾都在蘇聯加入國際阰盟一舉上所盡的力量幾乎是這位偉大政治家的生命史上最光明的一頁、巴爾都和李維諾夫的共同活動、以及兩大國代表間互相尊敬的態度、對於他們自身及他們在日内瓦所代表的國家都是一種光榮、我們絶對没有忘却、我們現在所說的是一位另一種社會制度和另一種世界觀的代表、巴爾都以來没有對共産主義表示過同情、可是巴氏確曾和李維諾夫站在一起、爲維持和平而奮鬥、爲反對那些準備人類新屠殺的力量而奮鬥、兩個國家在其保證和平的努力中、儘管有不同的意識動機和前提在統治着、爲爭取和平而作的鬥爭終是對人類有利的、我們在這位偉大政治家的墳墓之前絶對没有理由來隠蔽這樣的事實、他是爲和平奮鬥而死、而這種奮鬥是他的祖國所要求的、］（十一日塔斯電）</p>
<p>日本考慮</p>
<p>駐使升格問題</p>
<p>東京外務省今日聲稱、雖意國未商諸日本、遽决定與中國互換大使、但政府現仍考慮互換大使問題、先須考慮各種因素、如國際關係及中日兩國内政等是、而後始　解决互換大使事、日本在東亞有特殊地位、與其他外國完全不同、此種事實、在解决中日互換大使事時必須有充分之考慮云、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>法保持中東路債權</p>
<h3>獲餐車經營權</h3>
<p>滿洲里自中東路讓度交涉成立後、中東路債權者之法國態度、頗堪注目、法國國營之哈爾濱萬國臥車公司、已迫請追認償還三十萬金債務、其代價已獲得中東路東西南各綫七輛飯車之經營權、並已自八日開始經營、飯車内之廚司及侍役等、已全部改由白俄担任、故讓渡　後之對滿關係、恐將複雜化、（十二日電通電）</p>
<p>下關關於中東路讓　渡交涉携蘇聯方面細目案赴東京之東路理事長克資勒資軻夫、十一日夜乘聯絡船抵下關、旋轉乘富士號快車入東京、氏在車站語記者曰、職員並無何等動搖之色、讓渡交涉、一旦成立、大半均携家族歸國、因蘇聯正須多數職員、故不致有失業者、關於退職津　貼乃至撤回本國、亦無具體的要求、（十二日電通電）</p>
<p>關稅减低後</p>
<h3>日糖輸華激增</h3>

<h3>銀價上騰原因</h3>
<p>印度大批收買所致</p>
<p>倫敦今夜銀價在此間市塲上漲、係由於印度大批收買所致、華盛頓顯無操縱今日市塲之跡象、（十一國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦金融新聞今日稱、銀價之漲起、雖可謂係中印兩國買進及供給缺少所致、但美當局源源不絶之收買、亦必爲銀價騰起之主因、英鎊價格愈落、則美當道愈將加緊、其購銀政策、以期抵制其不欲有的美元漲價、此卽最近數日來銀價所以騰貴在比例上超過英鎊之低落也、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>羅斯福考慮</p>
<h3>貶幣値抬物價</h3>
<p>與控制農産發展貿易並進</p>
<p>戰債决定不列入新預算</p>
<p>華盛頓羅斯福總統今日與華倫敎授　及參議員勃爾克萊會議、頗有再以美元减値而求提高物價之可能、勃氏於會議畢後宣稱、美元减値殊有可能、彼以爲物價尙無限止之必要云、華倫　敎授則絶對緘默、惟謂妄事猜度終無是處、觀察者以爲總統之提高物價計劃、尙有增加政府控制農産力量及利用游資擴張國外貿易等項、總統對於農長華萊斯殊爲傾信、華氏主張美元减値所促進之輸出增加、不過暫時性質、故須與限止産額及發展貿易同時並進、始能不效云、至華倫敎授之參琥</p>
<p>加會議、若干觀察者以爲係表示减値之舉、恐卽將成爲事實、且盛傳政府或將要求下届國會廢除减値至百分之五十之限止云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓美國政府編成來年度預算之際、决削除恃各國支付戰債之財源、此因豫料各債務回到底不肯履行義務、故將戰債收入一項削除、此爲第二次云、（十一日電通電）</p>

<h3>蘇政一年之回顧陳果夫</h3>
<p>果夫等奉命忝主蘇政、自去歲十月就職、歲月不居、忽忽一年、自顧駑鈍、何克膺此艱鉅、特念服役本黨、應絶對聽從黨之使命、不敢計個人之自由、重以中央先進、及地方同志、紛相督促、凛於時局之艱危、益感職責之所在、遂忘鳩拙、勉效馳驅、任事以來、夙夜兢惕、冀竭其绵薄、以稍副我蘇省父老兄弟諸姑姊妹　之責望、凡諸興利除弊安民察吏諸大端、策畫所及、畢力以赴、於至事之利鈍、非所計也、</p>
<p>蘇省舊稱財賦富　之區、人文薈萃之地、而頻年國家多故整理未　、水旱頻仍、民困已甚、在積極的建設方面、旣感人力財力兩極缺乏、在消極的除弊方面、亦覺積習太深、轉移不易、處此環境、惟有督率同人、日夜孜孜、以勤輔拙、我同人果能多竭一分之精力、地方即可多得一分之效益、故雖日常庶政、不敢有斯　的須之懈怠、懼或有所未盡、以辜我蘇人士之望也、至於與革大計、博訪周咨、地方建議之言、民衆呼　籲之請、自不敢不勤求密察、務悉隱微、迨至議定後行、願負全責、固不肯以環境之困難、而有所移易、尤不屑計個人　之利害而有所趨避、此則區區之意、敢以昭告我蘇父老昆季諸姑姊妹者也、</p>
<p>國民革命之目的、在以破壞爲建設之先驅、即須能以建設爲破壞　之後盾、　如腐草荒穢、先以烈熖掃蕩、然後乃耕之耘之、　其良苗、今之時則畊之耘之之時也、吾人應以建設之心理、完成革命之工作、至於行政積習、因循敷衍、苟求無事、以保祿位、親民之官、莫如令長、而今之任斯職者、往往以文飾應付爲能事、地方惡勢力、又交相利用之、使賢者不敢有所作爲、不肖者轉緣因以爲利、上級政令、無從推行良法美意、盡成廢紙、政治之運用、旣失其機能、人民之隱微、遂無從通達、因認爲非使今之從政者、一律洗心革面、認淸職責之所在、實心實力、旣言起行、共遵革命過程之正軌、努力於建設工作不爲功、故一方面以公開方式誠求賢才、同時更培育薰陶、造成風氣、以期激濁揚淸、刷新政治、自古爲治之要首在得人、同人認此爲省府最大職責夙夜　　、未敢一刻或忘者也、</p>
<p>爲政有緩急、設施有程序、同人以爲地方政治之大綱有三、曰保、曰養、曰敎、蘇省承災飢積敝之餘、人民離析、匪盜潛滋、保安爲亟、自無疑義、富而後敎、古　有成言、今茲後先、亦無二致、一年以來所日與同人瘄口焦思從事籌畫者在此而已、茲更以設施綱要與其意義所在、爲我父老昆季、曁關心吾蘇政事者一陳之、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　未解飄零窺門憐少女願聞困苦惜玉訪貧家</p>
<p>但是他態度很大方，並不怕人家在旁邊窺探，依然緊緊的靠了那茶房，只管嘟囔着說話。李士　看了這副情形，心裏頭就有好幾分明白了。另一個茶房，見他進來了，替他開了房門送了燈火茶水進來。李士　伸　頭向外面看看，人已不見了，這就低聲問道：剛才外面和你們同伴說話的人，那是旅客嗎？茶房低聲笑道：不是的，李先生要看看他嗎？可以呌進來看看。李士廉道；這地方也有這種人嗎？是那裏人呢？茶房道；這裏開元寺有班子，都是南方人。無非也做的是外路人的生意。剛才這位，不是開元寺的，不過爲了家境貧寒，出來找幾個零錢花。他不是本地人，上輩子在陜西做官，窮下來没有回老家去，下輩子就没有法子了。說着，他倒是在燈下淡淡的微笑了一笑。接着道；呌他進來看看嗎？李士廉連連搖着手道；不用，不用。他是作官的後輩，我們就是作官的，我們官官相護，算了罷。他這樣的嚷着，早把隔壁　住的張介夫給驚動了，問道；李先生，李先　生，什麽事官官相護？他以爲李先生不喜歡這個，張先生也許喜歡這個呢。李士　廉把剛才的話，倒丢開了，笑道；無意中在這裏遇到一個朋友，他是銀行界的人，將來西安要設分行的話，他就是這裏分行的經理了。他和我是多年的朋友，交情不算壞　，我若是在這裏弄到了稅局一類的差使，倒少不得人他帮忙　。張介夫道；你就是說和他官官相護嗎？（八三）</p>
<h3>梁山伯與祝英臺</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>從前女人的心理，是没有［離婚］兩字的，［白頭偕老］，是唯一的願望。要達到［白頭偕老］的願望，有好法子　嗎？有；寗波人是早已有了。</p>
<p>咱們看過新劇的，誰不知道有祝英臺梁山山伯這一齣戲。寗波地方，在夏夜裏，有一種盲詞，沿街彈唱，也唱說這祝梁哀豓情史，非常受人歡迎。到了陰歷八月初八日，說是梁　山伯的誕辰，男的女的，老的少的，蠢的俏的，都市化的，鄉村氣的，或坐船，或乘車，成羣結隊，都到這所江邊梁山伯廟裏來燒香。寗波人有句欲語道　；［若要夫妻同到老，梁　山伯廟到一到！］這不是寗波人早得着［夫妻白頭到老］的秘訣嗎？</p>
<p>那末，寗波女人，永不會做孤孀嗎？這也未必吧。不過做孤孀的，尤有到梁山伯廟去燒香的必要。今世的所以要做孤孀，也許是前世不去燒香的緣故；要下世不再做孤孀，那裏今世可以不去燒香呢。有了這個理由，自然梁　山伯廟的香火，有盛無衰了。據說；寗波小靈峯上，有所小小的葛仙翁殿，也有一句俗語道；［有人拜咱生，謝銀一千兩］！葛仙翁曉得人們貪財的心理，所以他老人家四月初十那天生辰，祝壽買牒的，人山人海；這幾張破爛的紙牒，便　是一千兩的謝銀啊　。和尙道士的生意興隆，都是這些把戲。</p>
<p>寗波府誌說；［梁山伯，字處仁家會稽，出而遊學，道逢上虞祝英臺，僞爲男裝；與梁共學三載，一如好友。旣而祝先　返；又二年，梁始歸訪於上虞，始知其爲女也，悵然而歸。告諸父母，請求爲婚，而祝已許字鄮城馬氏矣。事遂寢。未幾，梁死，葬鄮城西淸道原。其明年，祝適馬　氏，經梁墓，風電不能前。祝知爲梁墓，乃臨穴哀慟，悲感路人；墓忽自啟，身隨以入。事聞於朝，丞相謝安請封之，名曰　［義婦塚］。一說梁　山伯曾爲鄞令，是東晋會稽人。這件事，雖然有些神話，大槪其中還有些蹊蹺；不過事情是香艶的，足供後人的談助呀。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （沈瘦若）</p>
<p>春是動心的時期；夏是熱心的時期；秋是凉心的時期；冬是冷心的時期；這是天心流轉的定式。</p>
<p>人心的流轉大槪也是那麽樣吧？所以人心的變幻，顯得平常　，不足驚異的。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后在城内約摸兜了半個時辰的工夫，便便中所有的大街全走遍了；可惜我不曾請問伊所得的影像如何，否則倒很可和我自已的感想比照一下。出城之後，伊竟不讓大家有休息的時間，立刻又命令他們把伊抬到城邊的一座小山上去。這座小山的高度雖是很低的，但人若是到了它頂上去，也很能看到附近一帶的景物了！尤其是那一條古　意盎然的萬里長城，格外的可以看得淸楚一些了！我正在獨自默默地懸登高臨眺的樂趣，忽聽太后咐李蓮英差人去給我們準備轎子，我就知道這個好機會是一定不會再失去的了。登山望田野，這是何等好玩的事情啊！人原是無有不好玩的；我想其餘的女官，那時候必然也很高興。至於我們的轎子是絶對不成問題的；雖然我們並不曾把自已日常所坐的帶來，但在前淸時候，轎子乃是各地唯一的交通器具，要搜覓十幾乘，眞是極不費事的；何况慶善們通知這裏的官員準備接駕的時候，已曾附帶的吩咐過，敎他們預先替我們端正下幾乘官轎，以便應用。</p>
<p>一到山頂，太望着那蜿蜒把伏的萬里長城，發出一種得意的微笑來。［當初，這一條長城原是爲着要把我們隔絶在外面而築的］！伊很興奮地說道；［然而，現在呢，我們已經站到裏面來了！而且還站在這裏眺望着它。我想這是誰都不曾想到的！其實，我們和中國本部有什麽分别呢？一般也是中國的一部份；語言，習尙，大半是相同的，而他們内地的人，偏要把我們看做是另外的一起，那眞是小見識了！自從我們進來當國以後，越發的打成一片了；從前的畛域，可說已一掃而空，惟有這一項已經頽廢的大工程，還殘缺不全的這留着］。（一四八）</p>

<p>大概乘過十六舗到盧家灣法租界六路電車的人們，都知道西門斜橋過去，接壤華界地方有一段長長的隙地；向往聽說是條呆水河，在幾年前纔把它塡塞起來的；那隙地對過有市面，有不少的店舗子，可是不算經濟，和其他商肆售價差不多；隙地左面一帶，都是些矮小汚穢的民房！茅屋草棚是其間的點綴物，我們從想像中知道，那個地方無疑的是勞工苦力的混合所了；隙地上有個露天市塲，却不同普通的舊貨攤，它們塲内條分縷析，每一種性質的細本經營，隔開一幅布壁，作它的營業之所，上面也有一幅布，遮蔽日光的薫蒸，細雨的襲擊，可是偶遇暴雨狂風，也得要停止交易了，如此鱗次櫛比，有二畝地的寛廣；市塲有理髮所，懸着穿衣鏡，安頓着沙發椅，剃頭匠也是雪白的號衣，他們的技術，必然高過街頭巷尾携面盆凳子的學徒，而低於蕭漢記一樂也的理髮師了；油條，大餅，是裏面的中心營業，埋頭大嚼者，幾乎是肩摩踵接；其餘如粥店，荳腐漿攤兒，小湯糰担子，都是露天市塲的臺柱；他們市塲裏，除了理髮所，似乎是偏於喫的方面，斜橋又有一個著名的大本營，（舊貨攤）正和這個喫的小市集，南北嫓美，相映成趣咧；那邊玩的還有西洋景，猴把戲，賣拳頭，····眞是個具體而微的遊藝塲，大槪就算勞工苦力們工餘的娛樂吧？</p>

<h3>復興農工之好消息</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>讀廿三年十月三日報紙，載有極好之消息者三種，一爲浙省建設廳向滬銀行界借欵三百萬元，統制收買秋繭，於上月二十日開秤，迄今已收鮮繭一萬四千五百擔，繅折爲四百五十斤至六十斤，預計尙可續收二萬餘擔，决將繅絲委會併入收繭委會，負責辦理繅絲事宜云云。一爲全國經濟委員會，自統制棉業以來，成績頗佳，今歲已有多處地方，棉産豐收，尤以西北，最爲宜於植棉，將來供本國紡織外，，兼可輸出於日本。一爲印度需要我國産品，函請國際貿易局介紹下列各品（甲）草蓆扇子炮竹，（乙）茴香油桂皮油等。吾因而起十萬分之希望，以爲救濟農村，提倡生産事業，循此軌道進行，則人盡其力，地盡其利，不出數年，定能進於富强之域，可斷言也。古之爲市　，本爲有司者之事，庶無壟斷左右之弊，上年曾見某邑繭行同業，以不入同行者放價收繭，認爲大逆不道，竟由官府禁止其放價，予竊以爲大惑不解。當此農村破産之際，方謀高價吸收，以資鼓勵之不暇，乃復禁止收買者之放價，使蠶户處於無可奈何之地，是誠反其道而行之者矣。今我浙省，有此善舉，預料來年，蠶户必見增多，而蠶種改良，亦可見諸事實，向謀伐桑改業之家，或且亟謀添種，欣欣向榮之狀，宜復見於來年。對外貿易，絲茶本屬大宗，能由官府經營，即自有其統制之權，雖不得利，亦無傷也，蓋就農材經濟而論，八口之家，所求只在温飽，但使作物登塲，所入足敷所出，亦即無過分之企圖。若使蠶桑事業，不致有虧蝕之虞，則人人皆盡心力而爲之産量必增一倍。産量增一倍時，所費工本並不必需一倍，即其售價自趨平伏，亦爲事理之常，是在三五年中，蠶絲價與人造絲相等，宜可能也。即或不能，而由政府提高人造絲稅，使與蠶絲市價相等，則固可能，但使國内絲銷，不爲人造絲所奪，即不致不過剩之虞。故吾以爲浙省有此良法，各省大可仿行，庶於農工方面有整個的調劑之可能，即就米糧而論，値此新穀將登之際，亦可由府庫吸收，以免爲市僧所抑。向來新榖上市，米價必落，初非供過於求，實由農户急於變錢，遂爲賤丈夫所壟斷，若由官府收買，即照現市，增高百分之幾，亦屬無妨。蓋以往年而論新米上市之際，比之明歲，靑黄不接之時，往往價値相差，竟至百分之三十以上。蓋市僧經營，其利息之計算，比之銀行計息，磊穝　一當十，例如一分利者，在銀行以週年爲凖，而在市僧方面，則一轉手間，即需賺　一分。故凡長袖善舞，專門躉積之户，往往大發其財，諺稱之爲米蛀蟲者，蓋言勝逄獨操，本不怕有虧蝕，所怕只有蛀蟲蛀其躉米而已。若由官府收儲，但用甲　防蛀，即無無怕，若慮洋米侵銷，亦可以關稅爲壁壘。但使農民得以飽暖，而無患於飢寒，即足使我全國人心，漸歸安定。至於不耕而食，不布而衣之一班人物，縱令出價倍於今昔，亦屬無妨。彼蓋實逼處此，亦將不得不自行設法，轉向耕織中求生活矣。故吾以爲治平之策，但使以有易無之事，能由有司者治之，即可免除一切阻難，復興農工事業，其在斯乎？印度所需物品，不過滄海之一粟，利之所在，人必趨之。但使國際貿易方面，能由政府主辦，一方則懸價吸收，一方則由國營運輸，不沾沾於一物之盈虧。但使入超變爲出超，即達藏富於民之目的，若令工商家各個爲對外貿易之圖，吾料種種困難，處處顧慮，必無濟於事也。甚願我政府與金融家亟起圖之。</p>

<h3>高壓直接電力綫之整流增高電壓法</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>目下吾人製作小型收音機，每因電源變壓器沉重不堪，及高壓繞製之困難而採取直接電力綫之整流方法。此式固已盡便捷之能事矣，然因高壓方面之限制（電力綫電壓至高祇有二百二十弗打），不能使眞空管盡量工作。例如５８效率最大時屏極電壓需二百五十弗打；否則工作不良。最近雖有２５２５等整流管問世，可以毋需電源變壓器並可以適當綫路作倍壓之用；然此管祇合美國標準，卽電壓祇在一百數十弗打時方可應用；過高則不堪勝任，此時必須串聯電阻以降低電壓至相當程度。吾人已知凡電流經過電阻，必有Ｉ２×Ｒ之消耗。當２５２５在二百二十弗打電力綫應用時，一管消耗兩管之電力，而所得電壓仍在二百二十弗打左右，此其不合用處也。</p>
<p>今請述普通眞空管作倍壓之整流方法。</p>
<p>可以兩枚之眞空管，例如７１或其他之整流管，照所繪之圖連接。此法所必需者係一隻改繞之電鈴變壓器或自繞之低壓變壓器，分别供給兩管之燈絲電流。ＶＩ之屏連接Ｖ２燈絲電源之中心分綫，再接高壓一端。Ｖ２之屏極爲直流輸出之負極。高壓之另一端接兩隻串聯之大電容器之串聯處。爐波與普通相差無幾，可由圖中明瞭。如進綫爲二百二十弗打，則理論上整流後可得四百四十弗打之輸出；惟整流管阻流圈電容器均有電阻存在故輸出稍低於四百四十弗打。此式之眞空管係串聯應用，故輸出電流並不增倍。若倍壓外同時尙須倍其電流者，則各管尙可並聯一隻眞空管。共爲四隻，目下眞空管價格甚低，。四隻所値亦無幾許，且並聯後，效率方面可增善不少也。</p>
<h3>新式氣化銅拾音器</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>拾音器Ｐickup的職務，是在將唱片上音波的變動，變成電波的變動，所以又呌做唱片扱取器。現在常用的拾音器大槪以磋石式，（MagneticType）的居最多數。此種拾音器，輸出的電能很小，（通常約在半弗打左右）使用時，往往要加上兩級低週率放大後，纔能得到適當的音量。因此，在新式祇有一級低週率放大的收音機内使用，便須改動檢波管綫或者竟要另加一級低週率放大纔行。</p>
<h3>第一圖</h3>
<p>最近美國新發明一種氣化銅拾音器、CopperoridePickup是利用平常炭屑傳話器CarbonMicrophone的原理而構成的。如第一圖，Ｔ爲橡皮圓筒筒内滿貯氣化銅屑粒，Ｍ爲金屬片，Ｒ爲搖桿。Rocker使用時，搖桿依矢頭所示之方向上下擺動，氣化銅的電阻，亦隨之變化，（變動的數値，約自四萬至五十萬歐姆。）結果，輸出的電壓，自然也隨之更動。其作用正與通常雙鈕炭屑傳話器受外來聲浪而變其電阻的情形相似。</p>
<h3>第二圖</h3>
<p>第二圖，示氣化銅拾音器，接綫的方法ＳＷ爲單刀雙擲開關，使用時擲向下方。Ｒ爲裝於拾音器上之音量調節器拾音器的電源，則自Ｂ電路内摘取，電壓自二十五弗打至二百五十弗打，均可適用，電流則在一千分安培以下。這樣些微的電力，卽使在乾亁電池式的收音機内應用，也是不成問題的。（第二圖示拾音器在單管式低週率放大内接綫珷</p>
<p>的方法，故另外一鈕並未接上，如在推珷</p>
<p>挽式放大内使用，則雙鈕均可接上。）</p>
<p>氣化銅拾音器的特殊優點，有如下述；</p>
<p>（一）輸出電能極大祇須一級低週率放大，便可得到洪大的音量。</p>
<p>（二）本身電阻極大（平均電阻約在十萬歐姆左右）可直接接在任何收音機内使用丨毋須加裝配合變壓器等另件。</p>
<p>（三）音調完全高低音調，均可充分放出。</p>
<p>（四）音質優美因内部構造係推挽　式，故能避免各種失眞。</p>
<p>（五）重量甚輕重量不及二盎司，（通常磁石式拾音器的重量約在三盎司以上）使用時唱片不易受損。</p>
<p>（六）簡單耐用不若通常磁石石拾音器，常有斷綫及失掉磁性之虞。</p>
<h3>一隻經濟的二管交流收音機</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>本文所述之收音機，爲我最近設計試騐而認爲滿意者，該機之特點如下：</p>
<p>甲·用件經濟該機只有眞空管二，但實際上有三眞空管之效力。因該機中之６Ｆ７號眞空管爲一個三極管及一個高放五極管，所合成者；故可以一燈代二燈之用（並非來復式）。代乙電乃直接取自電源綫，甲電則用一電鈴　棚改繞後供給，故可免去高壓電源變壓器之設備。喇叭則採用永久磁石式者。又因經過喇叭之電流甚小，故防避燒毁其綫圈之設備亦可省去。再生力則用旋轉式綫圈架調節，可省若干另件機件在不改損收音效力之條件下力求减省。</p>
<p>乙·用電經濟該機曾用啟羅瓦特小時表測量，計用電一度可開聽約一百小時。若以市價每度一角八分計算，較省電式一燈機每小時用電銅元一枚者，尤爲經濟。</p>
<p>丙·略加改造，可改爲直流式或電池式。</p>
<p>該機在上海南市試騐時，用室内天綫，地綫繫於　　窗上·收得之播音極爲響亮音調逼眞。選擇力亦尙佳。完全不用天地綫亦可收聽。</p>
<p>其綫路如附圖。圖中之右上角爲。Ｆ７燈座之接綫法。其右爲收音部份，計用６Ｆ７之三極部份作回授式檢波，後用其五極部份作一級成音週率放大，而輸</p>

<p>入喇叭放音。中央爲電源部份，用丨Ｖ號眞空管作半波整流，用一電鈴方棚供給燈絲電流。其他另件之數値如下；ＬＬＩＬ２用蛛網板二十六號漆包綫；Ｆ本埠五圈，外埠十六圈，ＬＩ六十圈，Ｌ２四十三圈。Ｃ○○○五變量電容器，ＣＩ○○五固定電容器，Ｃ２○○○二五雲母式，Ｃ３Ｃ６一分兆法拉特，Ｃ４二分兆法拉特，Ｃ５四分兆法拉特。Ｒ三百五十歐姆，Ｒ１三百萬歐姆，Ｒ２五萬歐姆，Ｒ３三萬歐姆。ＡＦＴ三比一成音週率變壓器。ＡＦＣ三十亨利二十分千安培阻流綫圈。ＰＴ供給燈絲電流之變壓器，用電鈴方棚將其次級圈改繞爲六，三弗打之綫圈二箇。其他眞空管喇叭等。</p>
<h3>引入綫避雨法</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>引入綫自高而下，每値陰雨，極易引進雨水。結果，不特走漏電能，並且還會著濕室内各物，如果流入收音機内，更有損壞機件之可能。避免的方法，可在引入綫的引入　，縛上一個小錢，雨水便能沿綫滴下。（見圖）如果引入綫質料甚硬，祇須在引入處彎成Ｕ形（見圖圍内所示）卽行。</p>
<h3>無綫電在蘇聯</h3>
<p>— 仁榮</p>
<p>近讀一本［蘇聯約敎育］，内有講起無綫電在蘇聯的情形，特介紹如下：</p>
<p>［無綫電之友會］係蘇聯的業餘組織，會員百萬人，無論工人學生紅軍兵士，都得自由參加，因之分會多達二萬多處，再由各地會中設立的無綫電學校，也有幾十所，製造零件的工廠約六十家，還有一百多處顧問室，專以解答與指導研究者隨時碰到的難題，許多定期刋物，小册子，標語，到處風行，務把無綫電智識普遍得和家常便飯一般。</p>
<p>她們的廣播事業全然用作文化乎叚的，每天早晚播送國内外新聞各一次，和我國中央電台相似的，有早操，學術演講，外國語敎授，藝術節目方面，自不外乎歌唱音樂一類，派級趣味的節目，當然没有，莫斯科還辦一無綫電大學，在規定時間播送大學敎程。</p>
<p>收音機在蘇聯無用登記。更無需納費收音也絶對自由，比諸香港南洋一帶禁收中央播音者，各有天地，俱樂部，工廠，礦工塲，公園和紅色局（RedComer有類民衆茶園）等公共塲所，都備有大揚聲器，私人備的一燈機，約十多盧布一只，幾乎每人都有，即在窮僻的黑海沿岸和烏克蘭境内，也能收聽莫斯科播音。　　一九三三年全國廣播電台五十九處，總電力達Ｉ４９８ＫＷ，一比我國七十多電台而總電力祇有９０ＫＷ左右，眞的可說畸形了，今年她們又將在西比利亞和北冰洋一帶添設十多個大電台，蘇聯的短波播音，世界可聽的有莫斯科的Ｒen和伯力的ＲＷ１５，間有英語和華語報告，在我國用一二只三十號的短波機，足可收得很響了。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>藝術的形式和遺産（一）</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>形式是什麽？形式是事物的現象或形態。現象和本質（内容）並非全然同一的，但又不能機械地截然分開。在藝術上，形式的主要表現是在於作家的風格（Ｓtyle）。藝術家首要的工作是從現實攝取了藝術的内容，其次是以那特有的天才，予以藝術底加工。在這加工的過程中，藝術家最大的努力，是在怎樣地覓得和内容相應，且能增加内容的影響力的形式，卽藝術家的特殊底風格，來表現所攝取的現實諸事物。</p>
<p>現實是極端複雜的，人類的社會生活　，充滿着無數的矛盾和統一；所以在事件的發展過程中，在作爲社會的細胞的人物的性格，行動，感情，言語中，無一不反映着這複雜的社會底現實諸要素。現實底生活裏面，包含着人類的一切活生生的喜，怒，哀，樂，幽默，辛辣，嚴肅，詼諧，愛憎，愚敏等成分；牠們互相交織，互相滲透，藉人物的性格，行動，感情，言語各方面表現出來。因此，藝術家就被要求着採取一種綜合的風格（形式），來表現這種複雜的互相矛盾而統一的現實。這種綜合的形式，不消說，也應該滲透喜，怒，哀，樂，幽默，辛辣，嚴肅，詼諧，愛憎，愚敏等要素的。</p>
<p>車爾芮綏夫斯基（Chernyshevsky）説：「由歷史和現代生活之深刻的觀察，雖非屬於判定的惡人或善行的英雄，也在行着比詩人所設想出來的一切更可戰慄的犯罪，更爲昂揚的偉業，這事是被證明了。］這話可以當做我們一個有力的註脚。</p>
<p>没有這種綜合的形式的偉大的藝術家，我們雖找遍歷史也不能碰到。在莎士比亞，巴爾札克，哥德，托爾斯泰這些古典的偉大藝術家的作品裏，我們隨處可以找到這種綜合的形式的表現。現代的生活，是比過去來的更複雜了。我們的作家，更應該使這綜合的形式强化，但事實證明我們並没有充分地注意這一點。過去的公式化是不必說了，現在這公式化還不曾完全掃除。張天翼先生不久以前的一部分作品，有許多讀者看後都覺得有點［那個］，這恐怕是作者肆意驅使滑稽或詼諧的形式所致的吧。實際上，現實生活中並不只是這一要素，牠還有許多别的要素交織着。［莎士比亞的潑刺］這句天才底預言，乃是因爲莎士比亞的藝術形式，最足爲這種綜合的形式的代表而說的。這一點不是大可値得我們的注意和吟味嗎？</p>
<p>（二）這里，我聯想到文　上正在討論着的藝術遺産的問題。我們知道，莎士比亞，巴爾札克，哥德托爾斯泰那樣的藝術家，他們的意識是違背歷史的。然而，因爲他們不斷地在現實中探求的結果，實踐底過程把他們的世界觀逐漸地侵　蝕，融解，以至破碎不堪。他們都經騐過世界觀和創作方法的矛盾。像大家都知道的　一樣，這矛盾對於他們的作品，是［負］（Minrs）而不是［正］（Plrs）。那末，他們的意識，對於現代的我們是無緣的。可是我們却喜歡他們的作品，不但喜歡。還要承繼他們的遺産，這是他們的作品裏有着［永久的人性］嗎？不見得吧。藝術作品之有［永久性］，是因那裏面有着立脚　於現實上的具體的（形象的）典型的事實和人物之故。而這些事物又是經過藝術家以綜合的形式表現出來的，所以我們總覺那些人物栩栩如生　。正是這一點，使亞里士多德（Aristote）les)在詩中看也了［哲學的意義］，而認爲詩比歷史要高得遠甚。可是［永久性］並不能在靜的觀點上着眼，這［永久性］是動的。因爲人類不斷地在進展，人類的世界觀也不斷地在進展，而人類對於這些古典的藝術，也如對於其他的一切似的，是通過世界觀的三棱鏡去透視的。不同的世界觀獲得了不同的意義。譬如，奥斯托洛夫斯基（ANOstrovsdy</p>
<p>）的戲劇，近來在他的本國，從都市以至窮鄉僻壤，都受到極熱烈的歡迎，但劇中有損作品的現代底意義的情節，甚至人物，都被删去。</p>
<p>古典的偉大藝術，在思想方面旣和我們無緣，則可爲我們的遺産者，當在形式方面了。但這不是和形式與内容不能機械地分開的原則相矛盾嗎？</p>
<p>從形式論理學的觀點看來，這話到也不無道理。可惜事實上並非如此。［毁滅］的作者法捷耶夫，不是很受托爾斯泰的心理描寫所影響麽？他俩的作品却代表兩種不同的世界。這是爲什麽呢？第一，因爲古典藝術家的世界觀受現實侵蝕，所以那作吕里雖有反歷史意識的殘留，大部分却反映着歷史發展過程的現實；其次，我們承斷遺産並非盲目的模倣，却是有意識的攝取，所以能取好棄劣。</p>
<p>在要求偉大作品的聲中，除了强化作家的社會底實踐之外，這藝術的綜合形式和遺産問題，也非可以忽視的吧。</p>

<p>我是初次到日本，同時是由台灣到神户的；剛好在九月二十日由神户登陸以後的那天晚上，神户雖不很大的風，不過還不驚奇可怕。可是二十一日早上的報紙，已警報大阪（關西一帶）及其附近被颶風摧襲，同時颶風還繼續狂肆，直到二十三日晨才知道颶風掠過。可是各大報的號外。爭先散發，日本内地的空氣，　　　上。關於颶風的損失如何，詳情怎樣，國内報紙，想有相當紀載，不必於茲再贅；但是對於此次颶風以後的種種情形，似有追叙的必要，特别是宣傳和救濟的兩件事。</p>
<p>對於這次颶風和水災宣傳得最利害的，除掉報界而外，負有具體宣傳而有充分力量的，便算是是本的電影界。在二十日晚至二十三晨的幾天裏，颶風所襲刦的地帶至廣，但是一切的損失，和各方面的殘迹，在二十四日便撮製就緒，二十五日的日本各地戲院裏，便有颶風水災的新聞片，於是我也了一元去觀光觀光，攝片很淸晰，搜集的材料實在不少，據報紙所載的地方，可說是十分之八九均已撮製在内，此種神速的電影的宣傳，在中國從未見過，在日本則猶並未引以爲奇。不過無論如何，我們引以爲前車之鑒，國内電影界，將如何急起直追，以謀效勞於國家。</p>
<p>爲了看見新聞片所攝製的各種鏡頭，便引起我的好奇的，於是在二十六日的下午，我便由神户到大阪，去實地參觀一十。依據報紙所載的所謂災區按址往訪。大阪比較熱閙的街市被颶風帶水損壞的，在二十六日的下午，已經交通恢復如常，馬路依舊整潔，亦不像經過了若大的災害以後的地方，後經調查，始知日本政府連日帶夜的趕工，已經恢復了。就是災情比較嚴重的地方，也見不到像影片内那樣的頽影殘跡了，不久的將來，或者竟就是目前，我們又可看見像災前一樣的繁盛，也許更繁盛。如果要拿國内的情形比起來，那眞有天壤之别哩。國内水災旱災的情形怎樣了？閘北的殘屋頽瓦怎樣了？拿國内的情形來比較，人民，當局，應作如何感想！</p>
<p>介紹這種事實到國内，不祇是供人一讀，當他小小的新聞讀過就了，深希望國人對於這種情形，注意。效尤，和追進。</p>
<p>十月一日在東京帝國飯店</p>
<h3>行商</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>江底之夜（續）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>假如她是和言悅色的話，我也可以將就地和衣睡下了，但她却是那付不高興的臉色，便使人極不愉快起來。</p>
<p>［怎能够將就？····誰願意出錢睡這樣的客店呢？］</p>
<p>［客人，到了我們這地方，是要受點委曲的哪。］</p>
<p>接着冷冷地笑着，好像在嘲弄來客是不懂事的樣子。</p>
<p>［難道這地方會窮到這樣子嗎？</p>
<p>大槪我臉上稍稍露出了譏刺的臉色了吧，她便吊下兩隻嘴角，氣憤憤地說道：</p>
<p>［哪裏窮？這樣好地方！·····就是那些挨刀的，天殺的東西哪，接二連三地來搶。·····還有你們那些保商隊····哼，過一回光一回···］</p>
<p>一隻大足挿進門來，似乎是要大駡一通的光景，我走了一天的路，已經非常疲倦，此刻瞌睡又來了，受不住她這樣的吵閙，便連忙　搖手道：</p>
<p>［算了，算了，就這樣睡吧。］</p>
<p>光板的床上，很不好　，加以壁板縫裏，時常鑽入江風，因此，約到半夜以後，就一直醒了，閉不　眼睛。只聽見江濤打岸，有時覺得宛如處在海船上面一樣。</p>
<p>「篤篤篤···］店外接連地起着敲門的聲音，起初小而低沉，漸漸便大了起來［砰砰砰···］響着，直到屋内的小兒，都驚得突然哭了，才聽見女主人喂喂地急應着，跑出去開門。</p>
<p>［睡死了！媽的！晚上走這樣遠來！］</p>
<p>［呵呵！這是你們山上種的南瓜嗎？···小聲點，小聲點，今晚有人。］</p>
<p>「我曉得，我曉得，···」</p>
<p>男子帶着憤怒和譏笑的聲調。［人家是過路的···你這鬼東西！····］</p>
<p>［包袱大嗎？］</p>
<p>男子突然很小聲地問，女人的回答却低懲到聽不見了，我便輕輕地坐了起來，偏着頭凝神注意，略帶着些微的恐怖。偶然從壁板縫裏望到江上去，外面正是一天好月色，黑油油的江水，碰在江中突出的大石上，便濺射出無數燦然的銀花。對岸的崖頭，和挺出的崖腹，都給灰白的月光，畫出一層層黛色的樹梢，分外　得山中深夜的陰森和冷酷。一個遠方的旅人，晚上來到這兒息宿，半夜被人推下江去，這是誰也不會發現出來的。呵，可怖的地方呵！不安地躺在板床上，直到天要微明時，才昏迷迷地睡去。在天光大亮醒來，覺得自已還在着，便非常喜悅地做着早上要吃的東西。</p>
<p>昨夜來的男子，活像神話上說的一樣，天明時已不見了，只見女主人將一個壯大黄圓的南瓜，一刀一刀地連皮砌在瓦罐内，三個高矮不齊的孩子圍在媽媽的身邊，睜大貪食的眼睛，舐着帶有唾沫的嘴唇。</p>
<p>在挨近水缸的桌上，取一隻粗瓷飯碗，忽然看見壁上掛着一張小小的像片，就着窗外透進來的鮮朗晨光，還可以從一層薄薄的塵灰上面，分辨出兩個靑年軍人的雄健姿影。側邊隱約有字，細看始明白；</p>
<p>［民國八年與徐排長　於四川之瀘州，後徐君陣亡於成都龍泉　一役，即將此僅存之遺影，敬贈君之夫人惠存。</p>
<p>「陳長元謹贈」</p>
<p>字跡粗劣，大槪也是一個排老二之流寫的罷。回頭去看見孩子們和母親還在那裏熱心地弄煮着南瓜心裏便禁不住黯然起來。</p>
<p>［唉！戰爭的惠賜呵！（完）</p>

<p>阿賢阿得開暘圑圑地甲住冬生，請冬生　乎坐下來。冬生瘸斷續續地給報告着那塲全武行。</p>
<p>捉去了二個禮拜，壽夫大砲一肚子氣，老没處發洩。因爲今天隊裏不操操，衆兄弟往城去担菜。預備鹽菜，當辰　。他向班長告了假，回一次家。</p>
<p>壽夫大砲一回到牛頭材，便角角落找冬生瘸手；找到了晚上，壽夫大砲和冬生瘸手在路上碰到了。</p>
<p>眞是仇人相見格外分明。</p>
<p>［瘸手！你往那里去了！老子找了你一天。］</p>
<p>［往那去，還不是爲公事忙，上四岙下三岙跑的人累死！］</p>
<p>［累死！媽的！我倒要跟你算一算賬。］說着，壽夫大砲跨上一步，給冬生瘸手左手捉住了</p>
<p>［笑話，自家人，有話好說，算什麽賬。］冬生瘸手眞够和氣了。</p>
<p>［我和你今世無仇，前世無怨，爲什麽你要指點我，呌班長把我捉了去］。說着把冬生瘸手左手紋緊了一把。</p>
<p>［喔哇丨丨喔哇丨丨］冬生瘸乎呌起來了。［放了我吧！我怎麽會呌班長捉你呢！我怎麽會呌班長捉你呢！别寃枉人哇！］</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>從［瀋陽人口大增］說起</h3>
<p>— ＨＹ</p>
<p>本報四日北平專電，有這樣一段消息！標題是［瀋陽人口大增；］</p>
<p>［關外訊，日向東北各地實行移民以來，因吉東等地民衆武裝抗拒，致移來之日鮮農民，大部集中都市，又以東北各地土匪横行，日人無力維持治安，各縣民衆亦多集中都市，九月一月中瀋陽人口遂大增····</p>
<p>本來人口大增，是繁榮都市的一種表現，照普通一般都市人口增加的理論來說，是由於農村的經濟破産，農民在鄉不能生活，遂卽投身都市。但是，瀋陽的人口大增，却不是這種道理，而是由於四鄉不能安居，這就可以想見日本帝國主義在東北的治　是如何了。</p>
<p>、　　但是，在統計表上，瀋陽的人口究竟是大增的，還不是可以使日僞兩方向外界誇耀他們的都市繁榮麽。</p>
<p>可是事實究竟是事實，日人的無力維持鄉村治安，使得土匪横行，總是鐵一般的證據。土匪也罷，義勇軍也罷，有他們在一天，日本帝國主義就要感受淸鄉的辣手的</p>
<p>我們對着這種人口增多現象，該想到東北民衆的抗日壯舉影響的偉大。等到［瀋陽人口大减］的消息刋載時，東北已變成日人的安樂窩了。</p>
<h3>旅人</h3>
<p>— 沁</p>
<p>踏出了家門用力拖起有些酸軟的脚，急急向前走去，四週靜寂得像是在夜裏一般。慌	忙的望一望，胸部酸溜溜的，不自禁回過頭去看看，家門首上站着一個婦人，我的脚腿一軟，險些跌下去。母親姊姊那苦臉縐眉和哀聲，重敲得我的心絃條條碎亂了！走了又怎樣呢？但又不可能停步不行。揑緊包袱，離了最後的一條呌後頭巷的巷口，那巷裏的一切，是舊時嘗相識的，在依稀彷彿中，這些一點一滴的形迹，都給我的心深戳了幾下。人就像給泰山壓住了般，感到有些　　。童年的美夢，在悲慘的旅途中重閃現着牠的殘影，呌人那能不生起無限人生劇變的哀感！</p>
<p>灣灣曲曲的行盡了許多田畔的小路，挨着成熟的稻禾過去，家已經漸漸看不淸楚了，一切就更加覺得渺茫起來，再行過幾架小橋，步着岡陵起伏的山坡而去。没有聽見鳥聲，也看不見牧牛的孩子，和在田裏工作的農人，除了四週的遠山和天邊呈現在眼羊之外就像什麽都死滅了似的。凄寂，渺茫，我的面前就横着一片幽絶的荒野。我怎樣走去呢？脚是不住的動着；但我的心却什麽主意都没有。山漸漸高了，樹木和大石頭更多起來，站着定定神，才發覺自已是這樣迷茫的在山谷中走着。家鄉那悲慘</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>的音和影還没有消逝去，想到怎　樣走完這無數的荒山巨嶺，又怎樣尋到歸宿的處所？更加没有氣力走路了。一步步踏上去，山嶺是更深入和高斜，脚亦就漸漸增重酸痛，一步懶似一步。</p>
<p>坐在嶺徑上，細望着樹木和黑石頭，什麽聲音也没有。向誰去訴說呢？没有幽曠的閒情了。不知怎樣處置前路的旅人，此刻再没有什麽情感波動，只是冰冷冷的，感到人生就像一塊鐵，一塊死的石頭。然而冰冷冷的石頭，也必需向前滾去呢丨　開酸痛的脚步，踏着巨嶺過去。走不盡的山嶺喲，終需要酸痛的脚踏完牠，絶望的坐下去，又爬上來忍着踏上去。越爬越淸定，走不盡的遙遠的人生的旅途。不忍苦的爬過去，又將怎樣呢？！寂靜的山谷，荒凉的巨嶺上，蹒跚的脚步顚撲上去。没有涙，滿懷辛酸哀壯，爬了整天的嶺徑，朝着前面踱去。流落的旅人呵，什麽時候爬完艱苦的旅程呢！</p>
<h3>湖上</h3>
<p>— 楓</p>
<p>［漫把西湖比西子，淡裝濃抹總想宜］。固然，西湖在一年四季中，無時不是披着美麗的衣裳的。但我總覺得最美的西湖是秋天。那澄碧的水，山上的楓葉　　邊的垂楊，當空的　月···這些　這些無一不是美的。秋，是個　意的，多感的季節，　秋季裏的西湖，更是詩意而多感的啊！</p>
<p>西風漏了秋的消息，我便懷念起了西湖。西湖的秋，是多麽地使人懷戀呵！</p>
<p>秋是淸朗的，天高氣爽，白雲像輕烟似的在空間飄，太陽雖然是對着人間擺起臉孔，却是一點兒熱的力都没有。祇有西風在起勁地吹，吹着山上的楓葉；吹着岸邊的垂楊；吹起了湖上的瀲　；我獨自駕一葉的扁舟，從平湖泛起，經過三潭；經過柳浪；又經過了蘇堤；眞是。［十步回頭一佳景横看側睨各不同］哩！到了黄昏將近的時候，太陽早已把臉藏起来了，一陣風起，蕭蕭的細雨也跟着來了。雖然雨中的西湖有如披着輕紗的美人般的美麗，而令人流連不忍去。然而，想起了遠在南國的茵，却使我不禁爲之悵然，我想起了沫若那一首［愛人喲！你回不回來···］的詩，我又想到了我的茵；啊！這西湖的秋之神在把我的心絃彈動。</p>
<p>雨是越落越大，天也快黑了，於是我把舟打近岸邊來。誰知無意地從楊柳底下殘荷叢中，驚動了一對美麗的小鳥兒，這眞使我懊悔莫及，［觸景傷情］這一句話便也慢慢地開始在我的心頭活動起來。終於，在這烟雨籠罩着的湖上我又不禁唱出了這麽一首歌；</p>
<p>西風乍起，</p>
<p>衰楊低拂水，</p>
<p>驚動了荷叢雙翡翠。</p>
<p>寄語雙翡翠；</p>
<p>且莫惶恐，</p>
<p>且莫分飛；</p>
<p>請再買箇西湖醉。</p>
<h3>兩個世紀</h3>
<p>— 鴻</p>
<h3>千步散步及蕩馬路</h3>
<p>— 匀宜</p>
<p>中國有句古訓呌［飯後千步］，那是很合於衛生的。小時候放下了飯碗，就被祖父强迫着跟在他背後到廊下去［千步］。祖父自已捧了個水烟袋，眞是顯得那末悠閑，那［方步］的樣子也踱得很够味兒，那樣搖搖擺擺的千步，自然是輕而易舉的事。然而一個小孩子卻辦不到，要兩手垂着，按步就班跟　在祖父身後［千步］，眞是件天大的難事，我有時在祖父不注意的時候私下溜掉。</p>
<p>外國也有這方式。呌［散步］，比較中庸一點，早上或晚上，三五個朋友，或其挽了愛人的手腕到公園及比較靜僻的馬路上慢慢兒踱着，這樣對於小孩子比較合式；其理由自然相同，是丨丨合於衛生的。</p>
<p>我現在已是中年了，對於［千步］雖没有水烟袋可捧，自問不致於要［開小差］的。你想能有一個走廊供我飯後千步千步，這種安定的生活實是夢寐求之；就是中庸一點的［散步］也不能趨學歐化，自然没有朋友愛人是最大的原因。</p>
<p>然則你不想衛生嗎？誰說的！我每天在馬路上要跑上幾個鐘頭呢。不過没有孩子跟　在我後面那樣的悠然自得也没有挽着愛人的手腕那樣的瀟洒活潑，我一個人從這條馬路到那條馬路，不分晝夜，不論晴雨，高興時候就走，不高興就罷。我那種態度雖和［千步］，［散步］類似，　　　如何不能混爲一談，乃名　曰［蕩馬路。］</p>
<p>［蕩馬路］這名稱確没有前二　的古雅，與［衛生］原旨實有過之無不及。不信？聽我道來；</p>
<p>先照［千步］說法，無非帮助吃下去的飯消化，但是限定［千步］，如其今天飯吃少一點，顯然不够消化了。蕩馬路旣没有限止，在飯後，自然到消化完了爲止，不幸而正是肚裏餓的時候，也完成了下次［千步］的工作丨丨你不懂嗎？這就是說下次飯後，可以不必［千步］了。</p>
<p>照［散步］方面講，三五個朋友往往意見不一致，在馬路上有爭閙的事發生，旣不雅觀，而且爲了　一點小事動肝火，是太違反衛生之旨了。至於偕愛人散步，同樣有許多無名損失，這祇要你去一問那般［落河］的朋友，他可以幾小時的［搖頭］演說爲我證明。</p>
<p>於是［蕩馬路］尙焉。</p>
<h3>向着陽光的路上</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>到現在我深深地感覺倒，神經衰弱的症候的緊緊地抓着我了！</p>
<p>病着半個月的身子，在鏡子面前，我認識自已；是和以前的我兩樣了！瘦削的臉蛋，無神的瞳子，一個二十歲的少年，他的蒼老是跟着没有規則的生活逐漸地走到背馳着健康的路上。</p>
<p>夏天，朋友們到我的地方來，看到我裸在汗馬甲外面的臂膊。</p>
<p>［還是你比較健康啊！］我自已暗暗地覺得高興。雖然三四年以來，我的身體已逐漸的衰弱下去，在許多的朋友中間：我還是有些可以驕傲的！</p>
<p>以往的生活，眞太没有規則了；環境使我走向失眠症的魔道中去。現在我伸出瘦削的臂膀内喊着；［我需要着健康！］</p>
<p>没有健康的身體，是有離開生活軌有的危險。我該轉變一下啊，向着陽光的路上。受着牠柔軟光澤的滋潤，像一朶美麗的靑春的花朶似地；在牠黄金色的光茫下泅浴着！</p>
<p>結束了這夜的生活，那些是可以摧毁我的健康而不餘的。每天，當晨起爬進了我的窗口，在近郊的路上，迎着安生的陽光！那時上海的空氣，是没有軋士林的氣息；也並不飛舞着工廠的煤灰！雖然這個大都便前夜餘剩下來的渾濁，仍舊在空間冲突着；使我眷戀着邨頭的朝晨。但是我們不能離開生活啊，被生的極梏深深地加鎖着的我們！</p>
<p>我期望着這個工作，對於我没有間斷的一天。健康回來吧？仍舊佔有着我的身心。讓我們伸出粗大的臂膊，奔走着生存的前程；毫不受病魔的拘束地。</p>

        <h1>1934.10.13</h1>
<h3>The East Route Army Advances Vigorously</h3>
<p>The vanguard is only a dozen li from Ting City, and the bandits' situation is pressing, with intentions to abandon it. After our Fuzhou army captured Hetian, it continued to advance another twenty li for days, with the vanguard only a dozen li away from Ting City. Lin Sixian, the eighth district commissioner, telegraphed yesterday regarding the bandit situation. Although there are still bandit troops in Changting attempting to resist, all their counterfeit organization personnel and documents have been moved away, and the situation is chaotic. It seems that the bandits have no fighting spirit, and the recapture is absolutely no problem. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Yang Yuebin, the armed forces minister of the counterfeit central general mobilization in Xiamen, fled from the Ninghua bandit area and surrendered to the First Division. According to him, there are only a few bandit troops on the Changting-Ninghua line, and only the counterfeit Seventh Independent Regiment is stationed in Ninghua City, with no main force. The bandit hospitals of Ninghua and Hekou were moved to Huichang at the end of September. Furthermore, the supply stations in Mashan and other places bordering Shicheng and Ruijin have been abolished. The bandits intend to abandon Ninghua and Qingliu. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>After the East Route Army of Xiamen captured Hetian, it continued to advance and is now only forty li away from Changting. The area west of Hetian is all flat ground, with no high mountains.

<p>Lin Sixian, the administrative commissioner of the Eighth District of Fuzhou, telegraphed the province to report that after the remaining bandits in Hetian were severely suppressed by various armies, the main bandit forces, the Third and Fifth Army Groups, had fled to Ruijin. Our army has crossed Huzhebei and advanced to suppress them. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Wu Chengren of Fuzhou telegraphed that the Fang-Luo bandits had fled to Baojia Village and were caught up by our army. There was a fierce battle at Diaojin Mountain and Songjialing.

<p>The Japanese cannot sleep soundly, building fortresses to prevent attacks. According to a person from Andong in Shenyang, the anti-Japanese righteous army in Andong and Fengcheng area has a strong force. Their guerrilla tactics make the Japanese unable to sleep soundly. Recently, the Andong Police Department has laid iron bar fences on the border between the attached land and the Chinese territory, with a large number of night police patrols to prevent the righteous army from attacking. Also, the Yalu River Paper Company near the Chinese border has built private fortresses and hired 20 retired soldiers to form the company's self-defense corps. (Hualian Telegram on the 12th)</p>

<p>The central political area of Nanjing was early designated around the Ming Palace site. Not only are people not allowed to build or sell, but no land has been acquired. After review by various ministries and commissions this time, there have been slight changes to the original plan. The first step is to send personnel from the Internal Affairs and Finance Ministries to survey and determine the four boundaries. After the boundaries are surveyed and completed, a map will be made, and construction outside the political area will be prohibited. The principles for construction will be laid out, and land in residential areas will be requisitioned. (Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>He Yingqin Arrives in Nanjing to Talk</p>
<h3>Military and Political Affairs in North China Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Henan Strive for Construction</p>
<p>Mongolian Princes and Nobles Support the Central Government</p>
<p>He Yingqin of Nanjing arrived at Pu on the 6:30 PM special train on the evening of the 12th. He Yaozu, Zhang Zhizhong, Tang Youren, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, Cao Haosen, and others crossed the river to welcome him. After He got off the train, he took the Chengping ferry across the river and returned to his residence to rest. He is scheduled to visit Chairman Lin and President Wang tomorrow morning to report on the situation in North China. He will go to Shanghai within a few days to pay respects to his mother-in-law. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>He Yingqin of Nanjing talked to reporters from the Central News Agency, saying, "My request for leave to come south this time does not involve any tasks. It is only because my mother-in-law, Madam Wang, passed away in Shanghai and is scheduled to be buried within this month, so I have come here to attend the memorial service and take care of everything. Also, I have been away from Beijing for nineteen months, so I am taking this opportunity to return to reorganize the affairs of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Before I went south, I spent a week inspecting the Chahar-Suiyuan area along the Ping-Sui Railway. This time, I also inspected the Ping-Han and Long-Hai lines as I visited Chairman Chiang and attended the opening ceremony of the Luoyang Military Academy branch. I deeply feel that the responsible authorities in the provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Henan are able to work hard and earnestly for local construction. Regarding the New Life Movement, the provincial governments and the people are also able to do their best to promote and implement it, achieving remarkable results. The troops under the jurisdiction of the Peiping Military Council, at the end of last year, in order to balance income and expenditure, cut the number of soldiers by more than 57,000. The dismissed officers and soldiers, except for the old and weak and those with bad habits, have been properly resettled. The lives of the officers and soldiers currently on the rolls are extremely stable. Regarding military expenditures, since I took charge of the branch council, I have been actively engaged in tightening expenditures, not adding a useless person, not using an unnecessary sum, and establishing a budget to ensure that income and expenditure match. Now, each month's regular expenses are paid according to the budgeted amount, and temporary expenditures are also paid as necessary. In the past year, everything has been made public, and officers and soldiers at all levels have been able to understand the difficulties of the times, work hard and operate diligently, and not slacken their forward and upward hearts due to the lack of material things. In terms of spirit, the party, government, military, and people in the provinces of North China are able to unite sincerely, which is even more comforting to the people of the whole country. Finally, when reporters asked about the situation in Mongolia, he replied that since the establishment of the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Committee, Prince Yun, Prince De, and the princes of various leagues and banners have been able to unite sincerely and support the central government, and they are eager to make achievements in education, industry, and other important policies. However, because the Mongolian compatriots have always made a living by animal husbandry and live in uncertain places, all construction is inevitably slow. Furthermore, on this trip to Chahar and Suiyuan, I reached Baotou in the west, and originally planned to visit Bailing Temple to meet with Prince Yun and Prince De, but due to time constraints, I was unable to go. If there is an opportunity in the future, I still plan to visit Mongolia to increase my knowledge and promote improvement." (Central News Agency telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>He Yingqin of Xuzhou left Beiping and arrived in Luoyang on the 9th to attend the opening ceremony of the Luoyang Military Academy. On the 11th, he took a special chartered car eastward along the Long-Hai Railway. He arrived in Xuzhou at 8:00 AM on the 12th. Zeng Wanzhong and others welcomed him at the station. After He got off the car and inspected the welcoming troops and returned the salute, he invited Zeng to board the car for a meeting. At that time, the Jinpu Railway had prepared a special Tai Shan train. Qiu Wei also sent Dong Xiqi to Xuzhou to take care of the car. When He moved to the special car, he instructed Wang Gongyu, the magistrate of Tongshan County, to build civilian residences between Xubu, northeast and two other routes, to improve the scenery and help people's livelihoods. He set off southward at half past eight. Before leaving, He told reporters that he was coming south to attend the funeral of his mother-in-law, Madam Wang, and to attend the opening of the military academy in Luoyang by the way. He said that the situation in North China is very quiet, and that he had a slight delay on his way from Jing to Hu, and that he should be able to return to Ping recently. He was wearing a military uniform and looked very energetic. He was accompanied by Xie Zhongyuan, the head of the confidential group of the Peiping Military Council, as well as secretaries, adjutants, guards, and other people, more than ten people in total, and the entourage was simple.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Forward and Retrospective View of Italian-Yugoslav Relations</h3>
<p>The assassin who killed King Alexander of Yugoslavia in Marseilles, France, was a Croat, and the motive was reportedly revenge for the King's oppression of Croat freedom. World opinion generally believes that the responsibility for the Marseilles tragedy is clear and cannot be attributed to outsiders. Even the traditionally hostile Italy and Yugoslavia should not have any conflicts, as the Emperor is concerned. In yesterday's commentary, we said, "If there is no internal strife in Yugoslavia, the superficial international disputes may not be difficult to resolve without a trace." This is the same idea.</p>
<p>However, according to recent telegrams, the Yugoslav people, saddened by the tragic death of their king, have launched anti-Italian riots. Demonstrators in the area of ​​Giant White Belgica even claimed that the assassination of King Alexander and the assassination in Zagreb in March of this year were both funded and planned in Italy. An officer from the Italian Consular Office in Leibach was also beaten by the crowd, which is about to lead to negotiations between the two governments. From this newly emerging dispute, we recall that the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia in September of this year was also on the verge of extreme deterioration. The Italian government even recalled its representatives who participated in the Belgrade International Chamber of Commerce, and general public opinion in Yugoslavia also launched a large-scale anti-Italian campaign with all its might. The official newspaper of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested severing relations with Yugoslavia, believing that "the political systems of the two countries are fundamentally different. For countries like Italy and Yugoslavia, there is no possibility of reconciliation except to hold Yugoslavia accountable." Based on this position, the Italian government has lodged a formal protest demanding that the Yugoslav government ban anti-Italian remarks in the country. The gradual worsening of the situation is caused by the old grudges between the two countries.</p>
<p>Considering the origin of the discord between Italy and Yugoslavia, it is due to the different national policies, and the root cause of the problem lies with the Allied Powers. As early as 1915, the Italians had obtained a secret promise from the Allied Powers as a condition for their participation in the war. The content roughly stated that once the war was over, Italy's wishes for Italia Irredenta, and the three places of Dalmatia and Albania could be realized one by one. In other words, the Adriatic Sea can be transformed into a private Italian lake. The Allied Powers will never hinder its actions. After the war, the Paris Peace Conference was convened. Clemenceau and Lloyd George secretly assisted Italy. Wilson initially opposed the idea, but the Italians threatened to withdraw from the meeting. Wilson reluctantly agreed to the agenda for the sake of realizing the League of Nations. The Peace Conference arbitrarily allowed Italy to seize a part of Albania, and the rest was allowed to be regarded as a trust territory and exercise actual power. Later, after the Albanians actively resisted, the matter subsided. The Italian poet D'Annunzio then called on patriots to occupy Fiume on the Adriatic coast and build a small republic as an outpost of Rome. In January 1921, Fiume was merged with Italy. As an important trading port, it originally belonged to Hungary, but the Yugoslavs believed that they had the right to inherit it. The Italians took the lead and could not help but feel pained. However, due to the pressure of strength, there was no way to do anything until the Treaty of Rome was concluded in 1924, when the Yugoslavs recognized the fact of the merger. At the same time, the Italians also acknowledged the three peace treaties of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Trianon, and Neuilly as guarantees to indirectly maintain Yugoslavia's rights under the peace treaty.</p>
<p>King Alexander's policy was based on resisting Italy. In terms of its strategy, first, it was to unite the internal affairs of the Balkans, and second, it was to connect with the forces of France and Germany. Regarding the former, such as concluding the Balkan Pact with Romania, Greece, and Turkey this year, and the successful visits to Bulgaria, were all remarkable achievements. Regarding the latter, such as accommodating Germany to resist the Italian forces in Austria-Hungary and interacting with France to repair the old friendship between the member states of the Versailles system, were also concrete manifestations. This trip to France to return the visit was ambitious. Its greatest intention was still to get rid of Italian pressure in order to strengthen itself. No wonder Mussolini recently said in a speech in Milan, on the one hand, he expressed his sincerity in turning to peace with the Yugoslavs, and on the other hand, he still said, "If the news is true and Yugoslavia continues to harm Italy and cause pain, then the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia will never improve."</p>
<p>The unsatisfactory past relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia has long been a public fact. However, whether the relationship can further deteriorate due to the newly emerging disputes depends on Mussolini's attitude and the policies of countries such as Britain and France as the shift. In our observation, a person with international political knowledge like Mussolini will not use the emotional agitation of the Yugoslavs as an excuse to break off diplomatic relations. Moreover, in today's complex international relations, it is often possible to affect the whole body by pulling one hair. Now that France's policy toward Yugoslavia has not changed its original intention of friendship, the relationship between the Yugoslav government and Britain will be closer than before, and there are still very deep roots between the Balkan countries and Yugoslavia. Therefore, Mussolini will carefully consider the changes in the international situation before preparing to take different actions, and he will never act hastily and bring misfortune upon himself.</p>

<h3>Various Countries Strive to Prevent a Major Outbreak</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Officials Understand France</p>
<p>Mussolini Orders to Maintain Calm</p>
<p>French Government Dismisses Negligent Officials</p>
<p>Well-informed observers in Belgrade stated that although King Alexander of Yugoslavia was murdered in France, it will not leave a lasting bad impression on the relations between the two countries. After Yugoslavia learned of the tragic death of the King, the whole country was excited and unanimously hated France, but now it is gradually returning to calm. The resignation of French Interior Minister Sarraut has further eased the public sentiment here. From the beginning, officials here have understood the attitude of the French government and its sincerity in mourning the death of the King. According to government officials, there is no place for the French government's actions to condone the murderer. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome: Prime Minister Mussolini is determined to prevent the Yugoslav people's excitement caused by the death of King Alexander from turning against Italy. Although there have been anti-Italian demonstrations in various parts of Yugoslavia, the Italian government today strictly ordered officials and all newspapers across the country to maintain calm and ordered officials and newspapers to continue to express sympathy for Yugoslavia's national mourning during the mourning period. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Giubiliana, Yugoslavia: Today, there were public demonstrations here, claiming that the assassination of King Alexander and the assassination in Zagreb in March of this year were both funded by Italy and planned in Italy.

<h3>Sarajevo Disturbance</h3>
<p>Residents Riot All Night</p>
<p>Sarajevo, the place where the World War broke out, experienced riots all night last night. Mobs in the streets attacked anyone who they imagined to be an enemy of the murdered Yugoslav King Alexander, regardless of who they were. Serious demonstrations broke out in the Leibach area on the Yugoslav-Italian border last night. An Italian consulate staff member was beaten and seriously injured for opposing the crowd's insults to Italy. When the mob first started the riot, they first attacked Catholic churches, believing that Catholicism and Italy were one and the same. Many historical buildings inside the church were destroyed. After the church was destroyed, the crowd's anger slightly subsided, and the authorities were able to send additional police to carry out prevention. However, the riot resumed shortly thereafter, and the crowd gathered more and more. All houses that did not have black yarn hanging in front of the door to express mourning were looted. At 2:00 a.m. this morning, a bomb exploded at the post office here, destroying the entire interior and injuring one postal worker. The incident in Leibach is likely to cause diplomatic problems between Yugoslavia and Italy. In the capital, Belgrade, the cabinet submitted its resignation to the regent last night, but was retained by Prince Paul. It is likely that the government will reorganize the new cabinet after the funeral. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>French Interior Minister</p>
<h3>Sarraut Resigns to Take Responsibility</h3>
<p>Cabinet to be Reorganized Soon</p>
<p>Paris: The Marseilles assassination case had its first political repercussions last night. Interior Minister Sarraut has submitted his resignation. Mr. Sarraut's resignation is intended to calm down the public's anger over the alleged lack of protection for the Yugoslav King. The resignation has been accepted by Prime Minister Doumergue. The new Yugoslav King Peter II, accompanied by his mother and grandmother, left Paris today for Belgrade. Queen Marie felt a little unwell when she boarded the car, but there was no major problem. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: French Interior Minister Sarraut has resigned tonight to take responsibility for the Marseilles tragedy. The French cabinet is about to be reorganized. It is now believed that Prime Minister Doumergue will formally resign after Bartou's funeral and will soon reorganize the cabinet. Justice Minister Cheron is also on the list of those to be removed due to public criticism. It is rumored that Public Works Minister Pietri is expected to become Foreign Minister. The French government has received a note from the British government stating that British Foreign Secretary Simon will represent the British government in Bartou's funeral. Today, Paris received news that Romanian King Carol decided to postpone his visit to France due to the death of Yugoslav King Alexander. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: The scope of the cabinet changes may not be limited to the Interior and Foreign Affairs departments. However, the general discussion in the House of Representatives lounge is that no matter how the cabinet personnel are changed, Prime Minister Doumergue must try to maintain the nature of the "political truce cabinet." He especially emphasizes retaining Herriot and Tardier, so that they remain cabinet ministers without portfolio. Regarding the replacement of Foreign Minister by Public Works Minister Flandin, the rumors are getting louder and louder, and it seems that they will be realized. If so, the vacant position of Minister of Public Works will be succeeded by Perrenot, a right-wing member of the House of Representatives. As for the position of Minister of the Interior, it will be filled by either the current Minister of Agriculture Queuille or the current Minister of Commerce Lamoureux, both of whom are Radical Socialists and the same as Sarraut. In short, since the positions of Minister of the Interior and Minister of Foreign Affairs have been vacated, the ministers of various departments will inevitably be changed to fill the vacancies. However, what is said at present is just a speculation. It is difficult to determine what the real result will be. Prime Minister Doumergue does not want to express anything about the cabinet changes before Bartou's state funeral. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: After the Marseilles tragedy, the head of the National Detective Squad, Bedouin, was dismissed yesterday. Only a part of public opinion believes that this measure is satisfactory. In addition, there are other measures still being planned. At the moment, Interior Minister Sarraut has submitted his resignation, and the cabinet changes have begun. However, there is no doubt that Doumergue will remain Prime Minister. As for the extent of the cabinet reorganization, many newspapers say that the scope must be expanded considerably. Public Works Minister Flandin succeeds Foreign Minister, and Welfare Minister Marchandeau succeeds Interior Minister. The voices are the loudest. Yesterday, Prime Minister Doumergue met with Welfare Minister Marchandeau for a long time, probably related to this matter. Some newspapers hope that Justice Minister Cheron will also submit his resignation, while other newspapers do not think so. As for the opposition newspapers, such as L'Action Française and L'Écho de Paris, they advocate that Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court Matterel succeeds Minister of Justice.

<p>Paris: Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić arrived here and immediately paid a visit to Prime Minister Doumergue. After leaving, he also visited the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Léger, to discuss various issues unrelated to the two countries. It was not until 6:00 p.m. that they dispersed. That evening, he returned to his country in the same car with the new King Peter II and his mother Queen Marie. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister and the French authorities both said that the two countries' dignitaries have suffered at the same time. From now on, the opinions and actions of the two countries should be more consistent. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: Central Europe is a troubled area in Europe. King Alexander of Yugoslavia came to France this time to discuss the maintenance of peace in that area within a broad scope. Unexpectedly, he was murdered after landing in Marseilles, which caused the planned plan to be suspended. However, the Yugoslav government and the French authorities still want to continue their efforts to maintain and consolidate peace. The long talks between Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić and Prime Minister Doumergue and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon are a manifestation of this will. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: French newspapers unanimously stated that King Alexander of Yugoslavia still struggled to support himself at the time of his death and said to Foreign Minister Jevtić, "Maintain the friendship between France and Yugoslavia." The value of this statement is no less than a will. Therefore, French foreign policy will not be subject to any changes, and the Yugoslav government will also maintain the Franco-Yugoslav alliance without changing its original intention. All the people of Yugoslavia will surely unite to support the new king. L'Intransigeant in Paris reported that the peaceful policies of the late Foreign Minister Bartou were suddenly suspended due to the tragedy. Now the governments of Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia are all waiting for the decision of Bartou's successor in order to restart negotiations, and the case files of Franco-Italian and Italian-Yugoslav relations will be opened first. Regarding the sporadic demonstrations in Yugoslavia, the newspapers are convinced that the Yugoslav government will be able to deal with them with calm and wise attitude. Le Petit Parisien reported that Yugoslav people believed that the tragedy was definitely not caused by someone in Yugoslavia opposing the government, and the responsibility should be sought in the international arena. L'Écho de Paris was quite surprised by the number of dignitaries who had accidents this year, such as King Albert I of Belgium, Romanian Prime Minister Duca, and Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss, who all died unexpectedly. King Alexander of Yugoslavia has now been tragically murdered, and French friends have passed away one after another. This is truly a great misfortune for France. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>New King Leaves France to Return Home</p>
<p>Belgrade: After the Regency Government was sworn in today, the Congress decided to dedicate the honorific title of "His Majesty Alexander, who unifies the country and is devout in his faith" to the late King. At present, the funeral program has not yet been arranged. The remains will be transported to the port of Split on the Adriatic coast on Saturday and Sunday, and then moved to Zagreb to set up a shrine for the public to come and pay their respects. The funeral will probably be held at the cemetery of the Oblinz Church next Wednesday. Demonstrations were held in Sarajevo and Osijek. The people of Sarajevo threw stones at the buildings of a company run by Croats and the Italian Consulate. The people of Osijek destroyed a newspaper office of the Croat ethnic group. The agitated psychology can be seen. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>

The French President and cabinet members all went to the station to see them off. The police protection was very tight. When the Yugoslav Empress Dowager and the new King took a car to the station, police rode in motor vehicles to escort them. The public was not allowed to approach the special train's parking place, but there were many onlookers, all of whom were silently watching the special train's departure. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Wanted Fugitive</p>
<h3>A Clue Before the Tragedy</h3>
<p>Terrorist Organization is Very Large</p>
<p>Paris: There is a new discovery in the investigation of the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia. A young Yugoslav named Nalis, also known as Klramo, is now proven by the police to be the mastermind behind the incident. Nalis was originally a well-known dangerous element. He had secretly discussed with Kourman many times in Paris, then accompanied him to Aix, and then went to Marseilles to eat with Kourman in a tavern facing the port. This was a few hours before the incident. According to the waiter, the two stayed in the tavern for several hours, ate a lot, and showed anxiety when not drinking, and often went to the street to look towards the port to see if the Yugoslav King's cruiser had arrived. They left the restaurant at 3:30 p.m. Nalis disappeared after the incident. According to official reports, the two people arrested yesterday on the Swiss border were not accomplices. However, they admitted to knowing Kourman, but denied directly or indirectly participating in the murder. The two will be brought to Paris for questioning tomorrow. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today, the police arrested two assassination suspects, Pinišu and Novak, in a hotel in Solun. They have admitted to the authorities that they had contacted Kourman, the murderer of the Yugoslav King, in Paris, and admitted to carrying forged passports. There is another suspect named Charlie who exchanged gunfire with the police and managed to escape without being arrested. The arrest of these two people was due to the suspicion of a bartender at a hotel near Fontenbleau station. Pipišu only drank a glass of beer for two pence, but the small bill he gave was as much as eight pence. The bartender suspected that he was not a good person and secretly reported it to the police station, and the police station also reported it to the Solun</p>
<p>Police Department for arrest. The passport held by the arrested person was issued by the Czech Consulate in Trieste this year. It stated that the arrested person was from a certain place that belonged to Austria before the war and now belongs to Italy, and it stated that he entered Switzerland from Como, Italy, on September 26. However, the passport was not countersigned by a French official. The arrested person looked calm and composed when he was detained at the Solun Police Station. He initially claimed to speak Portuguese and needed to find someone who knew Portuguese to translate for him, but later he admitted to speaking Serbian. It is said that after questioning by the police station, it was learned that the two arrested people were members of a large-scale terrorist organization. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>It now seems to be confirmed in Annemasse, France, that the two people belong to a large-scale organization, whose headquarters is in Yugoslavia, with branches in various countries. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Marseilles police have now definitively proven that the murderer Karl</p>
<p>had two pistols with him, but only used one. This weapon was a Mauser gun, which could fire twenty times in a row and could be converted into a carbine, firing 280 bullets per minute, no less than a small machine gun. A waiter at a hotel reported to the head of the detective squad here that the murderer Kálmán had lunch at the hotel on the 29th of last month. If this statement is true, then the murderer has been staying in or near Marseilles for at least a week. Regarding the passport carried by Mr. Karl, the Czech Consul here investigated in detail and proved that it was indeed forged. The stamp of the Czech Consulate in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and the Consul's signature were all forged. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3>Serbian Kings Often Die Violently</h3>
<p>Those with Odd Numbers are Often Unfortunate</p>
<p>Paris: The reasons for the deaths of successive Yugoslav kings and the numbers are not without correlation. This is mysterious and incredible. Since Serbia seceded from Turkish restraint, all those whose succession to the throne is an odd number have been ambushed midway and have not had a good ending. For example, the first generation King Karageorge was murdered by Obrenović Miloš in 1817. The second generation Obrenović had a good ending. The third generation Obrenović Michael was shot and killed by rioters in a park in 1868 while walking. The fourth generation Milan also had a good ending. The fifth generation Obrenović Alexander was shot and killed by a pistol in Belgrade in 1903 with Queen Draga. The sixth generation Peter I also had a good ending. Alexander, who was recently assassinated in Marseilles, was the seventh generation king. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

<h3>Respond to Japan's Termination of the Treaty</h3>
<p>US Delegation Decides on a Plan</p>
<p>Preparing to Strengthen Pacific Defense</p>
<p>London: The Associated Press learned from responsible sources today that during the preliminary negotiations of the London Naval Conference, the US delegation had prepared an answer to any proposal from Japan to terminate the naval treaty. If Japan formally proposes to cancel the current naval ratio, the United States will immediately propose a counter-proposal, advocating the abolition or major modification of Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, which restricts the deployment of US territories in the Pacific. According to diplomatic circles here, after the abolition of Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, the United States will be able to freely strengthen the naval and air force bases in the Philippines and Hawaii, and will also be able to freely open new naval ports in the Aleutian Islands, which are only separated from Japan by a narrow strip of water. Guam can also establish a powerful air force base, which will make the Japanese navy feel very uneasy. In this way, Britain will also have no choice but to expand its naval and air force facilities in Hong Kong. It is learned that Britain and the United States will firmly urge Japan to think twice before acting when negotiations begin. As for the future of the negotiations, opinions are currently divided.

<p>Guo Taiqi Returns to London</p>
<h3>Talks Briefly with British Reporters</h3>
<p>China's Failure to be Elected to the League of Nations was a Big Mistake</p>
<p>Naval Negotiations Should Not Leave Aside Political Issues</p>
<p>London: Chinese Minister to Britain Guo Taiqi returned to London from Geneva today. According to a reporter from the China Mail, before leaving Geneva, he stated that China's failure to be re-elected as a non-permanent member of the Council of the League of Nations would have serious consequences, so he consulted with representatives of major countries. This matter is unfavorable to the League of Nations, and it is definitely viewed as so by China, because for the first time, the Far East with 500 million people does not have a representative on the Council of the League of Nations, which makes people feel that Europe is indifferent to the affairs of the Far East, and those who point out that the League of Nations is only a tool for European diplomacy are even more eloquent. Minister Guo also stated that the result of this matter will inevitably weaken the position of those in China who advocate cooperation with the League of Nations, and make China listen to Japan's arrangements. Japan's call of "Asia for Asians" will be more powerful. Minister Guo now believes that the governments of European countries should realize the seriousness of the situation and seek ways to remedy it. Minister Guo also mentioned the naval conference, saying that China's attitude is that the political issues of the Far East cannot be separated from this kind of conference, which was solemnly declared by US President Harding in 1922. As for what actions the Chinese government will take to ensure that the political issues of the Far East are included in the agenda of the conference, he cannot predict it now.

<h3>World War Speculation</h3>
<p>Possibility of Outbreak Next Year</p>
<p>Japanese and German Ambitions as Obstacles to Peace</p>
<p>Statement by German Expert Steele</p>
<p>Steele, a New York expert familiar with the German situation and able to predict Hitler's purge two weeks in advance, now predicts that a second world war will occur next year. In his book "Second [World War]" published today, Steele claims that the German-Japanese conflict will begin and cannot be delayed beyond the summer of 1935. Japan will inevitably attack Soviet Russia to maintain its economic hegemony in the Far East, and Germany will invade the Saar to reclaim its rich coal and iron ore resources, as Germany is unable to pay France according to the Treaty of Versailles. Germany's invasion of the Saar will likely occur next January, just three months from now. At that time, Japan will take advantage of the chaos in Europe to attack Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Steele also reveals in his book the methods used by the German business community to bribe Japan. He claims that in August 1931, while working at the German Embassy in Tokyo, he was ordered to buy off Swedish shipowners, bribing them to leave Japan, at a time when there were large orders. The bribes came from the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and the German Industrial Association. As a result of the Swedish shipowners leaving Japan, German merchants received huge orders worth ten million US dollars.</p>
<p>Steele's previous statements about Germany have been remarkably accurate, and this latest prediction has aroused extreme concern both here and in Washington. (November 11th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Marseille Tragedy</p>
<h3>Lin and Wang Send Telegrams to France to Express Condolences</h3>
<p>Nanjing diplomatic circles report that King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou were suddenly assassinated on the 10th. After learning of this, Chairman Lin of the National Government immediately telegraphed the embassy in France to express condolences to the Crown Prince of Yugoslavia. At the same time, Wang Zhaoming, Acting Foreign Minister, also telegraphed French Prime Minister Doumergue to express condolences to the family of Barthou. The original texts of the two telegrams are as follows: (1) Lin's Telegram of Condolence: "Your Majesty King Alexander I of your esteemed country has suddenly passed away. The government and royal family of your esteemed country have encountered a terrible tragedy. I am deeply shocked and saddened. I hereby express my condolences and sympathy to Your Excellency on behalf of the Republic of China and myself. Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government." (2) Wang's Telegram of Condolence to Prime Minister Doumergue: "I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear of the sudden death of Foreign Minister Barthou. I hereby send my condolences and ask you to convey my sincere sympathy to the family of Foreign Minister Barthou. Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government." (Central News Agency, December 12th)</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Renowned Reporter Radek</p>
<h3>Discusses the Marseille Tragedy</h3>
<p>Radek of Moscow authored an article entitled "[The Marseille Assassination]" published in Izvestia. He said, "[The assassination of Barthou and the King of Yugoslavia reaffirms how unstable the foundations of peace are, and how many forces are trying to destroy the current unstable balance in Europe.]" Radek analyzed the political situation in Yugoslavia, pointing out that the country's relentless persecution of all anti-government movements may temporarily eliminate various national movements, but it has failed to eradicate terrorist groups within Yugoslavia. At the same time, these groups receive support from the intelligence agencies of great powers intent on weakening Yugoslavia, making the work of eradication even more difficult. The Marseille tragedy is clearly the work of a group belonging to this category.</p>
<p>Radek further discussed in detail the cracks in the alliance between France and Yugoslavia, the activities aimed at destroying the Franco-Romanian alliance, and the difficulties faced by France regarding its Polish ally. He also said, "[Although the logic of the situation requires the countries under the French alliance system to implement a policy of defending peace, and to work together to carry out this defense, the domestic economic situation in each country, with unresolved agricultural problems and national antagonisms, is everywhere undermining the stability of the government and creating a basis for all kinds of adventurous actions. All the difficulties mentioned above arise from this.]"</p>
<p>"[The German fascist newspapers constantly point out these difficulties to France, just as they had already seen "God's finger" in the Marseille incident. Germany itself is a boiler full of steam that is constantly looking for a way out. This steam will cause the boiler to explode. If Germany tries to swallow the Danube and Balkan countries in one gulp, or even succeeds, it will inevitably meet many new friends, whose original contradictions still remain. Germany is no better than other capitalist countries in curing the diseases of the Balkan countries.]"</p>
<p>Radek continued, "[Barthou has died in Marseille. He was not only an outstanding orator and a great diplomat, but also a man with broad historical insight. Life has confirmed the strength and prosperity of the Soviet regime, and has shattered Barthou's prejudices, enabling him to face the truth that the work completed by the plough of revolution in the former Tsarist territory has finally been completed, and there is no way to retreat. The facts grasped by a great historian became the source of all actions of Barthou as a diplomat. The efforts made by Barthou in the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations are almost the brightest page in the life of this great politician. The joint activities of Barthou and Litvinov, and the mutual respect between the representatives of the two major countries, are an honor for themselves and the countries they represent in Geneva. We absolutely do not forget that we are now talking about a representative of another social system and another worldview. Barthou has never expressed sympathy for communism, but Barthou did stand with Litvinov to fight for peace, to fight against the forces preparing for a new human massacre. In their efforts to guarantee peace, the two countries, despite the different ideological motives and premises that govern them, the struggle for peace is ultimately beneficial to mankind. We have absolutely no reason to conceal this fact before the grave of this great politician. He died fighting for peace, and this struggle is what his country demanded.]" (TASS Telegram, November 11th)</p>

<h3>Obtains Rights to Operate Dining Cars</h3>
<p>Since the settlement of the transfer negotiations for the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria, the attitude of France, a creditor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, has been quite noteworthy. The French state-owned Harbin International Sleeping Car Company has pressed for the recognition and repayment of a debt of 300,000 gold rubles. In exchange, it has obtained the rights to operate seven dining cars on the east, west, and south lines of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and has already started operations on the 8th. The chefs and waiters in the dining cars have all been replaced by White Russians. Therefore, relations with Manchuria after the transfer may become complicated. (Dentsu Telegram, December 12th)</p>

At the station, he told reporters that the staff did not show any signs of wavering. Once the transfer negotiations are concluded, most of them will return to their home country with their families, because the Soviet Union needs a large number of staff, so there will be no unemployed people. There are no specific requirements regarding retirement allowances or repatriation to their home country. (Dentsu Telegram, December 12th)</p>

<p>The rise in silver prices in the London market tonight is due to large-scale purchases by India. Washington shows no signs of manipulating today's market. (National Telegram, November 11th)</p>
<p>The London Financial News said today that although the rise in silver prices can be attributed to purchases by China and India and a shortage of supply, the continuous purchases by the US authorities must also be the main reason for the rise in silver prices. The lower the price of the pound sterling, the more the US authorities will intensify their silver purchase policy in order to resist the unwanted rise in the US dollar. This is why the price of silver has risen in proportion to the fall of the pound sterling in recent days. (Reuters Telegram, November 11th)</p>

<h3>Devaluing Currency to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Proceeding in Parallel with Controlling Agricultural Development and Trade</p>
<p>Decision Not to Include War Debts in New Budget</p>
<p>President Roosevelt met with Professor Warren and Senator Bulkley in Washington today, raising the possibility of further devaluing the dollar to raise prices. Bulkley declared after the meeting that the dollar could very well be devalued, and he believed that there was no limit to the necessity of prices. Professor Warren remained absolutely silent, only saying that speculation would lead nowhere. Observers believe that the President's plan to raise prices also includes increasing the government's control over agricultural production and using floating capital to expand foreign trade. The President has great faith in Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, who argues that the increase in exports promoted by the devaluation of the dollar is only temporary. Therefore, it must proceed in parallel with limiting production and developing trade to be effective. Some observers believe that Professor Warren's participation in the meeting indicates that devaluation is likely to become a reality soon, and it is rumored that the government may ask the next Congress to abolish the limit of devaluation to 50%.

It was because Lin Jinghun was planning to recruit bandits to disrupt the county administration, so he had to deal with it. He has now decided not to resume his post, and the county affairs will be handled by the government. As for Zhu Zhuowen, the temporary county magistrate elected by the county citizen's assembly, he originally planned to go to the county government on the 11th to take office, but fearing that the incident would escalate, he declined the appointment and fled to the provincial capital.

<h3>War Zone Reorganization Issues</h3>
<p>The Gongyue Incident will not have further complications</p>
<p>Regulations for the War Zone Reorganization Committee have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: Following the Qian'an Incident, the Yutian Gongyue Incident, which directly impacted the Hebei Provincial authorities, initially faced difficulties in handling it. Regardless of the content of the demands made by the other party, the fact that they solemnly convened meetings repeatedly in Tianjin before making the demands proves that the situation could not be taken lightly. In addition to reporting the details of the case to the highest political authorities in the north, the Hebei Provincial authorities calmly negotiated, neither arrogant nor humble. Until recently, the relevant parties have indicated that the matter has been resolved and there will be no further complications. Whether it has been completely resolved is impossible to say definitively, as the agencies involved are avoiding discussing the matter.</p>
<p>The authorities believe that the reorganization of the [war zone] is essential to prevent disputes. This agreement was reached last year when the [war zone] was taken over. Outsiders claim that it is a new brewing matter. Authorities have unofficially stated that those who hold dissenting opinions do not understand the situation, and explained the initial plan: the first step is to take over, the second step is to provide relief, and the last step is to reorganize. The work for the first two steps of taking over and providing relief has long been completed. Reorganization is naturally inevitable. Therefore, after Huang Fu returned north to take office, he ordered Yin Tong and Li Zeyi to draft the organizational regulations for the [war zone] Reorganization Committee to begin preparations. When the [war zone] is reorganized and ready, the politics of the north can begin to be improved.</p>
<p>According to sources, the organizational regulations for the [war zone] Reorganization Committee have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The date of establishment should be after approval. The committee's future work items are planned to include four areas: security, transportation, foreign affairs, and education. Security refers to the expansion of police strength in each county. Transportation refers to the construction of roads and telecommunications. Foreign affairs refer to negotiations with the Japanese side, the crackdown on Japanese-Korean hooligans, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in areas not covered by the Boxer Protocol. Education: People in the [war zone] have always felt that education is not widespread. In the future, attention should be paid to promoting educational methods to reduce illiteracy. The above four major areas will be handled by four offices under the committee. The personnel selection is rumored to have been finalized. The authorities will issue a clear announcement when the committee is established.</p>
<p>A key figure who came to Beiping to attend the Political Reorganization Conference, during his visit to Huang Fu, discussed the recent situation in the war zone. The key figure asked whether the work of the war zone Reorganization Committee would encounter difficulties in the future. Huang replied that it depends on the people involved, and cited the example of a certain giant official of the late Qing Dynasty who was stationed in the Northeast as proof, stating that the actions of old politicians are worthy of our emulation.</p>
<p>In summary, the new problems in the [war zone] seem to have come to an end. Regarding the reorganization work thereafter, considering matters reasonably, concrete realization will inevitably occur in the near future. Unexpected disputes will not easily occur. (11th)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang After Returning to Chengdu</h3>
<p>The five-route front has repeatedly won victories and has turned into an advantage</p>
<p>Chiang telegraphs Liu Xiang to commend the recovery of key positions</p>
<p>Chengdu correspondence: Since Liu Xiang went to Kaijiang to make arrangements for the suppression of bandits in Sichuan, the banditry has been greatly suppressed, and the morale of the troops on all routes has been boosted. After Liu returned to Chongqing, he was persuaded to return to the province to preside over matters, and took a car west on the 8th. On the 9th, he passed through Zizhong, and arrived in the province at 2:00 pm on the 10th. Deng Xihou, Li Jiayu, Chen Jingxuan, Yu Anmin, Li Zhudong, and generals stationed in the province, as well as representatives from various agencies and legal groups, more than 200 people, went to welcome him. After Liu got out of the car and exchanged greetings with Deng and others, he got into the car and entered the city. Liu's face was radiant.</p>
<p>According to news from the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, (1) Liu Xiang telegraphed to the generals of all routes the day before yesterday, saying, "Recently, Commander Xu Yaoqing of the Xu Division telegraphed that bandits formed a night raiding team to harass us. We then formed a night counter-raiding team to contain them. Recently, we launched an offensive against the bandit positions. The bandits have exhausted their plans and the entire line will not hold. According to Commander Guo's telegram, the Guo Brigade and Regiment have captured Laojun Mountain, Hanshui Creek, and Fenghuang Village at noon on [2nd]. The Gao Regiment occupied the line of Duoshipan, etc. It seems that the Jiangling Creek line can be declared clear. I request that you all lead the frontline troops to advance quickly and immediately turn the situation into an advantage." (2) Guo Yizhi telegraphed to someone in the province from the front on the 5th, "On the 3rd, my Zhou Shaoxuan Brigade captured Laojun Mountain and Fenghuang Village. On the 4th, the regiment occupied Duo Jian and Yu Huangguan, and is advancing towards Jiangkou. The regiment occupied Mengxi River, and the regiment occupied Zhongsi Village. The remnant bandits retreated to Jiangkou. After the Yang Huigong army arrived, they advanced in unison. Yizhi has advanced to Tumenzi to supervise the battle." (3) Chairman Chiang telegraphed Liu Xiang, "On the [2nd], the military telegram was fully understood. The five-route counter-offensive and the recovery of key positions are greatly gratifying. I still hope that you will continue to work hard and continue to advance to defeat the bandit forces and control the westward advance of the Jingjiang bandits. Seal of Zhongzheng." (4) The Li Zhongxuan Brigade of the Third Route continued to patrol Shifotang on the morning of the 3rd and encountered more than 100 bandits. They made contact at Daijialiang and repelled the bandits in about one hour. It happened that the Liu and Li battalions of Deng Ying patrolled to Shiban Street and intercepted them again, killing dozens of bandits. Because of the rain and thick fog, they did not pursue them. The battalion took advantage of the rain and fog to ask the way to attack the bandits in Yuelaichang near Longbei Field. The bandits were unprepared and were suddenly attacked violently. They fled in panic. The Yang Battalion captured five boxes of mortar shells and a lot of baggage, captured a platoon leader and four soldiers. Later, the bandits from the back mountain rushed to reinforce, about two companies in strength, and launched a fierce counterattack against the Yang Battalion. The Yang Battalion still killed one company commander and eighty or ninety bandit soldiers. The remnant bandits fled in panic. It was getting late, so the Yang Battalion did not immediately follow up.</p>
<p>Henan Relief Society Report</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation in Huaifeng and Other Counties</h3>
<p>Please quickly repair the river channel</p>
<p>And allocate funds to relieve refugees</p>
<p>Kaifeng correspondence: Henan Province has suffered severe flooding this year, with Fengqiu being the most serious. According to the commissioner's report, I was commissioned to bring funds to Fengqiu to handle disaster relief matters. The county ordered the chiefs of the four districts and the Water Disaster Relief Committee to hire boats to provide relief in different routes and set up refugee shelters to actively implement relief efforts. On the 27th, I went with them in a small boat to inspect the disaster area and visited the Huayang Dike breaches to observe the actual situation. It was found that the dike had been silted with mud and sand due to the river rise in the past two years, leaving only a foot of dike body and more than ten large and small breaches. The Xibatou breach is connected to the Yellow River, and the river is still flowing continuously. The water in the disaster area rises and falls from time to time. In low-lying areas, stagnant water cannot be eliminated. Most of the refugees in the disaster area have fled. In the past five days, four large ships hired at the Xibatou breach have transported 5,565 male and female refugees. In the Baiwang Village and Huangling Town disaster areas, five small boats were hired to transport more than 2,000 refugees. Yesterday, the river district chief reported that the river water rose sharply by one meter at Shen time on the 3rd, and is still rising. As of the morning of the 4th, the water in the disaster area has increased by more than three feet. There are three main requests from most of the refugees in the disaster area: (1) If the Xibatou breach is not plugged, the water of the big river will always flow, not only will there be endless trouble, but also the river may change course and become a huge disaster. It is difficult to collect the wheat harvest. Please quickly block the breach and provide fundamental relief. (2) The Huayang Charity Dike is a guarantee for the four counties of Kaifeng, Changyuan, Huaxian, and Hua County. It has now been breached into a flat ground. If it is not repaired urgently, it will still suffer from a whirlpool if it is flooded during the period of high water. Please raise and repair it in advance for defense. (3) The county has allocated very little relief funds. The disaster is severe and the area is wide. The disaster victims have no food, clothing, or shelter. Please continue to allocate large amounts of relief funds, send personnel to distribute them, or use the disaster victims to block the breaches and repair the dikes, implementing work-for-relief, etc. We are now making every effort to raise relief funds to help the disaster victims and request that the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Association and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee find ways to repair and block the breaches.</p>
<p>Attached is a telegram from the Henan Relief Society to Xu Shiying requesting relief: [Shanghai Yunnan Road Renji Hall, Chairman Xu Junjian, it is reported that you are holding a meeting in Shanghai to raise emergency relief funds for various provinces, but Henan is omitted. This year, Huaifeng and other counties in Henan have suffered severe Yellow River disasters. More than 40 other counties have been flooded. The disaster is extremely serious and is the worst among other provinces. We have repeatedly reported this case and it should be included in the relief list. I earnestly request that you consider the Henan disaster and include it in order to avoid being missed. We urgently telegraph this request. Please consider it. The Henan Relief Society, Zhang Fang, bows.] The telegrams from the association to the Shandong and Hebei provincial governments have the same meaning as the telegram on the right, so they are omitted.

<p>Central Government Allocates Funds</p>
<h3>To Repair the Confucius Temple in Qufu</h3>
<p>The first batch of 100,000 yuan has been remitted</p>
<p>The central government plans to order provinces to share construction costs</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence: The provincial government initiated the restoration of the Confucius, Mencius, Yan, and Zeng temples in Qufu. Due to the large scale of the project and the lack of funds raised, it telegraphed to the central government to allocate special funds in order to complete it. Recently, Director of Education He Siyuan went to Beijing and contacted key figures in the central government to discuss the restoration of the temples and the measures to treat the descendants of the ancestors. The measures have been generally decided. He has returned to Jinan. The central government has agreed to pay 200,000 yuan for construction costs. Today (11th), the first batch of 100,000 yuan has been remitted, and the remaining 100,000 yuan and the 50,000 yuan assumed by Chairman Chiang will also be remitted soon. The provincial government of this province previously raised more than 40,000 yuan. After spending 30,000 yuan to repair the Yan Temple first, there is still more than 10,000 yuan left. It is heard that the central government plans to order provinces to share construction costs, 50,000 yuan for large provinces, 30,000 yuan for medium provinces, and 10,000 yuan for small provinces. If this is realized, the construction costs for the fundamental restoration of the lecture temples will no longer be a problem. The Preparatory Committee for the Restoration of the Confucius Temple has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow (12th) to discuss the implementation plan. It is also heard that Dai Chuanxian will personally come to inspect and guide everything when the temple restoration starts. As for the measures to treat the descendants of the ancestors, it is heard that Dai has sent a letter to Chairman Han of this province. In the future, it is planned to establish a national primary school, a national middle school, and a national Qufu academy in Qufu, generally imitating the measures of the Qing Dynasty's Qufu Four Clans School, so that the descendants of the sages and students in Qufu can attend school and promote the doctrines of Confucius.

<p>Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</p>
<h3>Shacun Station Robbed</h3>
<p>Employees' money, clothes, and belongings were robbed</p>
<p>Panyu grain station also looted by bandits</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Since the beginning of autumn, bandits have been appearing from time to time. After the Xin Xin Department Store on Huiai Road in Guangzhou City was robbed of diamonds and gold jewelry by robbers, the bandits in the outer districts have also become rampant. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway passes through Panyu, Dongguan, and Huiyang counties. These counties have been repeatedly robbed by bandits in the past. After the army was stationed there, the security was good throughout the year. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, the Shacun Station was robbed again. Shacun is under the jurisdiction of Panyu and is adjacent to the Nangang Station. It is a prosperous area of ​​traffic and has become coveted by bandits. On the evening of the 3rd, when the bandits saw that the road police's defenses were slightly lax, more than a dozen bandits, each carrying guns, broke into the station. All the stationmaster's office and workers' dormitories were ransacked, and the employees' money and clothes were looted. The bandits, having obtained their loot, were still not satisfied. Before leaving, they kidnapped a foreman. Fortunately, the foreman was resourceful and claimed that he was just a coolie and not a valuable hostage. The bandits thought he was a worker and unprofitable, so they released the foreman and shouted towards the nearby Honggang Battery and fled. When the bandits were far away, the station workers dared to go out and sound the alarm. The nearby guard team rushed to the area to search, but the bandits were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>In addition, the Panyu County government, considering that the late rice in the county has been harvested, sent personnel to various villages to collect grain taxes. A grain station office was set up in Dashixu, the central district of the county, to facilitate the payment of taxes from all parties. Recently, three or four thousand yuan of grain taxes have been collected, which has been coveted by bandits. Suddenly, at about 2:00 a.m. on the 2nd of the month, more than a dozen bandits, carrying weapons, surrounded the grain station office, intending to break in. Unexpectedly, they were repelled by the county soldiers. The bandits then opened fire with guns. Several county soldiers were outnumbered. The bandits then charged straight in and the grain collectors and county soldiers retreated to the backyard of the grain station. They sent people to report to the neighboring police team. Soon, the guard team arrived to assist and surrounded the bandits. The bandits knew that things had been leaked and fought hand-to-hand with the police team while retreating. Five bandits were captured alive by the police team, and the remaining bandits fled with their loot. After investigation, the grain tax was fortunately not lost, only the luggage and belongings of the staff were looted, resulting in a loss of several hundred yuan. (6th)</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Report by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>The Ta'er Monastery, Birthplace of the Yellow Sect Founder (Part 1)</p>
<p>[Unless one sees a wild elephant, one does not avoid the road; unless one sees Shakyamuni, one does not lower one's head.] This is the bold saying of the powerful Qinghai Tibetan tribes. The Tibetan people are known for their strength and fierceness, and killing is not considered a big deal. Their powerful figures recognize no heaven above, no earth below, and no king's law in between. However, upon seeing Shakyamuni, they must lower their heads. If the powerful are like this, one can imagine the faith of ordinary Tibetan people in Buddhism. I once met a lama who was collecting donations to repair a temple. When I first asked about [Central Government] matters, I greatly appreciated that they still had an impression of the Central Government. However, I was disappointed to find that they mistakenly believed the Central Government to be the birthplace of Shakyamuni Buddha. Furthermore, the living standards of the Living Buddhas in various large temples are not inferior to those of kings and nobles in Japan. Their monastic hats are made of yellow satin. When they go out for matters, they also sit in yellow sedan chairs carried by eight people. When they encounter Mongol and Tibetan people, all of them take off their hats and kneel down, not daring to look up, waiting for the Living Buddha to pass before they dare to proceed. In both Mongolia and Tibet, the honor and authority of Buddhist lamas are still dazzling. In fact, although some Mongol and Tibetan people have been influenced by Soviet politics and driven by British imperialism, the thinking of all the Mongol and Tibetan tribes in Qinghai, especially the Tibetan tribes, which account for the largest part of Qinghai's population, is still dominated by Lamaism. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Buddhism was gradually introduced into Tibet from India long before the tenth century AD. First, there were the Black and White Sects, followed by the Red Sect. Their teachings included the art of swallowing knives and spitting fire, and they indulged in smoking, drinking, and lust. Later, Tsongkhapa vowed to establish a sect, wore yellow robes, and honored Shakyamuni, with compassion for saving people, tranquility, and non-action as its main tenets. The world called it the Yellow Sect and called Tsongkhapa the founder of the Yellow Sect. In the fifteenth year of the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty, Tsongkhapa was born in Xining, Qinghai, and in the fifteenth year of the Chenghua reign, he passed away in Lhasa, Tibet. He had three great disciples, namely the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. With the help of the court at that time, his teachings became increasingly popular, and those who believed in it became increasingly common among the Mongol and Tibetan tribes. The influence of the various superstitions it sowed has greatly harmed the decline of national spirit, the decline of culture, and the decline of population. Now, a sketch of the Ta'er Monastery, the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, which is also where the Tibetan people look to for guidance, is presented below, so it is not difficult to get a general idea of the impact of Lamaism on the lives of the Tibetan people.</p>
<p>A Corner of the Ta'er Monastery</p>
<p>The temple is located fifty li southwest of Xining City. On the way from the city, you pass through villages such as Shuimo, Taomo Workshop, Xujiazhai, and Laoyubao. Rivers and canals crisscross, the farming is abundant, the willows are green, and the flowers smile, making one feel comfortable. Later, you reach Lusazhen, which has always been a major trading place for the Han and Tibetan people. The goods sold by the Tibetan people mainly include the skins and furs of livestock and wild animals, followed by Tibetan incense, felt, Buddha statues, and medicinal deer antlers, musk, saffron, etc. What they buy are grains, cloth, tea, silk, foreign goods, smoking materials, saddles, etc. There are about two hundred households, inhabited by Han, Hui, and Tibetan people. The houses are densely arranged. Foreign firms were set up in the past, but now the market is sluggish. Next to the town, the grassy slopes slant upwards, with palaces and buildings layered in the lush poplar forest, glittering with golden light, covering several acres of land, which is where the temple is located.</p>
<p>Initially, going up the slope, the forest ends at the temple, where eight pagodas stand tall, arranged vertically from east to west. It is said that when Nian Gengyao campaigned in the west, because the Living Buddha rebelled, he killed eight people here, so the lamas erected pagodas to commemorate them. Later, I visited the lama in charge of foreign affairs in the temple. The so-called Second Master first courteously offered grapes, melon seeds, oily tea, and fried rice. Then, he sent a lama who could understand Chinese to guide the tour. The temples and courtyards are numerous and of various sizes. They are connected by many secluded paths, which give visitors a deeper impression. What is more impressive is probably the Great Sutra Hall and the Great and Small Golden Tile Temples.</p>
<p>The courtyard of the Great Sutra Hall is rectangular in shape. The north, south, and east sides are corridors more than two zhang high, and the fourth side is the main hall. It was rebuilt after the fire in the fourth year of the Republic of China, with a combination of Chinese and Western styles, tall buildings and high steps, and a magnificent shape. There are three doors, with a total of eighty-one rooms. Measuring its interior, it is about five zhang long and four zhang wide, with an area of about twenty square zhang. It is said that it can accommodate three thousand lamas. The futons are arranged neatly in rows, about five inches above the floor. In the center, against the wall, is a special seat about four chi high, which looks like a podium in a meeting place. The Grand Lama who leads the chanting sits here, called the Dharma Platform. To the left and right of the platform are copper statues of Shakyamuni, Amitabha Buddha, Tsongkhapa, etc. In front are butter lamps, as large as wine cups, and a thousand glass boxes are piled up, each containing a treasure Buddha about one chi high, which is a statue of Tsongkhapa. It is said that some are made of pure gold. The area of the entire hall is very wide, and most of the straight pillars cannot be hidden. Although they are wrapped in satin, they are still very obstructive. Moreover, the air in the entire hall is filled with the smell of oil and mutton. The lamas' clothes are also not washed frequently, probably because they do not pay attention to cleanliness.</p>
<p>The Great Golden Tile Temple has three floors and is where Tsongkhapa's robes and alms bowl are buried. In the center is a statue of Tsongkhapa, said to be made of pure gold, solemn and radiant, and on a delicately constructed throne are his hand-painted blood portraits (it is said that when Tsongkhapa was preaching in Lhasa, Tibet, he missed his mother and specially pricked his blood to paint the portrait and sent it to his mother), footprints, relics, etc. However, they are wrapped in yellow satin and silk or stored in sandalwood boxes, and are never lightly shown to people except during the [Great Chanting] meeting period. The butter lamps in front of the statue are filled with copper containers as big as dou, and the flames are burning brightly, not extinguished for a hundred years. Outside the door, wooden planks are laid flat, and the monks kneel and worship, without stopping. Many people make vows for healing from illness, coming from hundreds of miles away, knocking [full-body prostrations] along the way, that is, drawing a line on the ground with their hands to mark the spot when they prostrate, and standing up to place their feet on the marked spot, and then prostrating as before, all the way to the statue of Tsongkhapa, joining the 108 beads of the rosary and worshiping three times, and then respectfully offering the carried silver and hada to the Living Buddha before stopping. No wonder the monks cannot finish eating the offerings, especially on the floor in front of the Buddha, the places where people prostrate their heads, kneel with their knees, and rub their hands have all formed grooves that are inches deep.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Party Members' Reunion Meeting</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Party Members from All Walks of Life Attended</p>
<p>The Meeting Passed Many Proposals</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Nanchang Municipal Kuomintang Party Members' Reunion Meeting was held at 2:00 PM on October 7th in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall of Yuzhang Park. More than a thousand people from all walks of life, including Central Committee Member Ding Chaowu and representatives from political, military, business, academic, and other sectors, attended. The meeting was chaired by Gong Xuesui, Chairman of the Presidium. Central Committee Member Ding Chaowu also delivered a very sincere speech.

Except for the lengthy speeches which are omitted, the details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Meeting Venue: The meeting venue was located in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall of Yuzhang Park. Therefore, on that day, the branches and trunks of the trees in Yuzhang Park were hung with colorful lanterns, like fruits. A rectangular white cloth banner was hung horizontally at the entrance of the park, with the large characters [Nanchang Municipal Party Members' Reunion Meeting of the Chinese Kuomintang] written on it. Colorful cloths were tied on both sides of the gate, and strings of colorful lanterns were hung on the top of the wall. Inside the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, small party and national flags were crisscrossed. Colorful crepe paper strips were hung on all four sides of the hall. A rectangular white cloth banner was hung horizontally in the hall, with the large characters [Kuomintang Party Members Must Absolutely Assume the Responsibility of Revitalizing the Chinese Nation] written on it, which was exceptionally alert. The Public Security Bureau police were responsible for guarding the venue both inside and outside. Those who did not have party membership cards or certificates from district branches were not allowed to enter. Several receptionists were assigned inside the venue, temporarily staffed by officials from various agencies.</p>

However, the Peking opera had just begun when it was already 6:00 PM. At that time, tea and snacks were distributed, including four bread rolls, a package of shortbread cookies and candies, etc., to fill the evening hunger. By about 9:00 PM, the Peking opera was over, and then they toured the park. At that time, tens of thousands of colorful lanterns were lit, like trees of fire and silver flowers. In the pavilions in the park, Chinese and Western orchestras played music alternately, and the melodious music was fascinating. Soon after, fireworks were set off, and the colorful lights soared into the sky, which was a spectacular sight. It was not until after 10:00 PM that everyone dispersed happily.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>What I Heard After the Closure of Xingye Bank: The Songjiang branch of the Chinese Xingye Bank in our county closed due to the absconding of the manager of the head office with funds. Manager Wang Ming also went to Shanghai, which has been reported in this newspaper. Now I know that after the closure of the Songjiang branch, the total deposits amounted to more than 40,000 yuan, including 14,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank and more than 8,000 yuan from rice shops. However, the debts on the books are only more than 10,000 yuan, which is a huge difference. It is said that Shanghai head office manager Zhao Baoyuan absconded with 100,000 yuan, and Lu also lost six or seven hundred thousand yuan due to speculation. Among the depositors, Songjiang Bank liquidation accountants Xia Sunhuan and Xi Yushu submitted a petition to the court today, stating that 632 yuan and 88 cents of the Songjiang Bank's debt had been recovered and deposited into the bank, originally intended for distribution to various creditors. Now that the bank has closed, they should request that the bank's real estate and property be placed under provisional attachment within the scope of the debt and request exemption from providing security. The creditors here plan to ask a liquidation lawyer to come to Songjiang to set up a registration office for convenient registration.</p>

<h3>Chinese Xingye Bank</h3>
<p>Suzhou Branch Closes</p>
<p>The Suzhou branch of the Chinese Xingye Bank has been established for three years and has an office on Lindun Road. Now, due to the impact of the Shanghai head office, it has announced its closure. On the evening of the eleventh, a notice was posted saying: [Our branch suddenly received a notice from the Shanghai head office last night, instructing us to cease operations immediately, which we have to comply with. Now the representative lawyer and accountant of our bank have issued a notice, asking all creditors to go to Shanghai to register. However, for the convenience of creditors in Suzhou, our branch has specially negotiated with the representative lawyer and accountant of the head office to set up a registration office in our branch. It is hoped that all creditors will bring their certificates to register from tomorrow.] However, the registration was not opened yesterday (the twelfth). This reporter inquired at the bank and learned that this was because the registration forms were still being printed. Currently, Suzhou branch manager Wu Songlu and deputy manager Qin Xinmin have both gone to Shanghai. The total deposits of the Suzhou branch, including savings, amount to approximately more than 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Female Thug Robs at Night</h3>
<p>Yin Youquan, a resident of No. 18, Shuyuan Lane, Yaochewan, runs a Lihe hat and shoe shop. At about 9:00 PM last night, Yin's 70-year-old mother, Yin Qinshi, was walking home to sleep when she reached Yaochewan. Because there were no electric lights, a female thug suddenly came out of the darkness, blocked her way, pressed Yin Qinshi to the ground, and snatched the gold ring from her right ear. When Yin Qinshi got up and shouted for help, the female thug had disappeared. Also, in Yuantong Temple in Beiqian Township, District 7, there were four nuns. Unexpectedly, they were suddenly robbed the night before, and the nun Qian Wu Miss was tied to the hall pillar and burned with a red-hot iron, scorching her skin. Only after all the nuns knelt and begged did the robbers stop. In total, more than 30 yuan was stolen in clothes, silver dollars, etc.</p>

<h3>Road Roller Crushes Worker to Death</h3>
<p>Residents of Houwan Street, near Wuyi Chengxi Town, Zhencheng Road, believe that after the construction of Zhencheng Road, the road surface of Houwan Street is too low, making it inconvenient for people from the whole village to enter and exit, so they specially raised funds to raise the road surface and pave it with stones. After the road was completed, they borrowed a road roller from the third engineering office of Zhencheng Road to roll the road surface flat. At about 5:00 PM on the 11th, the rolling was completed, and more than 30 workers dragged the roller back to the engineering office. Unexpectedly, when they dragged it south of Lianzi Bridge, worker Sheng Xingsheng fell on the road. The other workers had not yet noticed and were still pulling hard, causing Sheng Xingsheng to be crushed to death. Worker Chen Qinglu was also affected, and his legs and other parts were bruised. Afterwards, the local public security sub-office reported the incident to the county court for investigation and had the injured person sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Education Bureau Requests Repair of Minglun Hall</h3>
<p>A part of the buildings of the Confucius Temple on Xueqian Street in this county is currently occupied by the public Xueqian Primary School. Some of them have been rebuilt into classrooms, and some have been demolished into playgrounds. The Minglun Hall has now been converted into the school's grand auditorium, which is magnificent and unmatched in the whole county. However, the history of the hall is old, built in the Song Dynasty, and has gradually become dilapidated. It must be completely rebuilt. Therefore, the school principal Zhong Lianfen submitted a request to the Education Bureau for funds to repair it, one to preserve the historical site and the other to maintain the safety of the students. Now, the Education Bureau believes that it is necessary to repair the Minglun Hall because the current axis is also in the period of restoring the sacred, so it forwarded the request to the county government for instructions, or to the Ancient Relics Protection Committee for funds to be allocated for reconstruction.</p>
<h3>Old Farmer Commits Suicide Due to Starvation</h3>
<p>In Luhe, which borders Taicang in Hengtang Town, District 6, there is a resident named Wang Xiaolu, about forty years old, who lives alone in a thatched cottage. He usually relies on long-term labor to make a living. Unexpectedly, this year's drought made the autumn harvest hopeless. Xiaolu could not find anyone to hire him, which greatly affected his life. He had no choice but to go out and beg, hoping to survive. However, due to the poor harvest, begging was also difficult. Although he ran around all day, it was difficult to get a full meal. Until the eighth of this month, he did not get a single meal all day, and he had the idea of ​​committing suicide. That night, he hanged himself from the beam. It was not until the next day that he was discovered, which is also very tragic.</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Local Autonomy Model Training Institute</p>
<p>Alumni Association Holds Meeting in Nanjing</p>
<p>The alumni of the three sessions of the former Ministry of Internal Affairs Local Autonomy Model Training Institute are numerous and scattered in various provinces. There has been little contact. Now, more than 30 alumni in Nanjing, including Xu Weidao, have initiated the organization of an alumni association in order to study the theory of local autonomy, promote local autonomy academics, connect alumni feelings, and promote the spirit of mutual assistance. They have been approved by the Nanjing Special City Party Department and the Municipal Government for filing. Xu Weidao and others were previously elected as preparatory members, and preparations have been completed. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held on the 14th of this month at the Qingnian Association in the capital. Alumni from various provinces who have arrived include Li Shilin, Yang Baoqian, and Shi Ding from Jiangsu Province, Zhou Xitian and Wu Luan from Hebei Province, Ruan Guizhong from Hubei Province, Zhang Jizhong from Shandong Province, and Chen Shili from Henan Province. In addition, members from Guizhou, Hunan, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanxi, and other provinces have also reported one after another.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Water Detective Team Cracks Jurong Ransom Case</p>
<p>Xu Fengshan, captain of the fourth district detective team of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Bureau, reported that He Shilu from Sanyihe Town outside the south gate of Jurong reported that his son, Xiao Yunzi, seven years old, was kidnapped by bandits a month ago. Later, He received a letter from the bandits demanding 5,000 yuan, and they agreed to exchange the ransom and deliver the ticket in Yangzhoutou or Zhenjiang Jingkouling. The signal was to wear a white turban and carry a red lantern on the left. According to the report, the team sent detectives to secretly investigate the address and learned the whereabouts of the meat ticket. On the evening of the ninth, they rescued the meat ticket on a small boat in the Liuqian River and arrested Zhang Butao, the boatman, and sent him to the Guazhou District Department for disposal. As for the bandits watching the ticket, they had fled after hearing the news.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Tax Reduction in Disaster Areas</p>
<p>The Nantong District Administrative Inspectorate ordered the county magistrates to investigate the facts and announce the rent reduction, because only a few owners benefited from the tax reduction reported by various counties in the district, and 70% to 80% of the tenant farmers still paid the full rent, which was not enough to help the people in disaster areas.</p>
<h3>Uncle Forcibly Rapes Ten-Year-Old Granddaughter</h3>
<p>Zhu Bingnan's ten-year-old daughter, Yu Ying, from Lvsi, was studying at school and was seduced by her uncle Zhu Namao and forcibly raped, causing serious injuries. The Lvsi District Office reported the incident and arrested Zhu Namao and sent him to the court. Zhu Namao, 21 years old, confessed to the crime and was immediately detained. Zhu Yuying was sent to Nantong Hospital.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Bandits Tragically Murder Entire Family</p>
<p>The fourth district of Huaiyin is adjacent to Siyang, so its folk customs have always been strong and many people have become bandits. Langdun Stone Town North Bay in the fourth district, such as Lujiatan and Luhua Continent, is where bandits often haunt. Sun Zhijie, a villager two li north of Langdun Stone, had parents above and children below, a family of seven in total. For some unknown reason, they were all killed by bandits on the night of the eighth. General rumors say that they were either robbed by bandits or avenged, but everyone has different opinions. However, ordinary bandits rob and kidnap with the intention of obtaining wealth, but this time they killed the entire family, including the old and the young, which seems to have other reasons and is not like an ordinary bandit case.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Chairman of Luan Chamber of Commerce Accused</p>
<p>In the night of February 15th of the 20th year, Luan County suffered a military coup, resulting in losses of more than one million yuan. The former chairman of the province, Chen Tiaoyuan, specially allocated 10,000 yuan for emergency relief. After three years, the funds have not been distributed. Now hundreds of representatives of Luan disaster merchants, including Ding Bochao, Zhang Zigong, and Zheng Jinzhang, have accused Zhou Ziqian, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, to the provincial government for misappropriating the disaster relief funds to the detriment of the people and for illegally operating private businesses, saying that all 10,000 yuan of emergency relief funds were in Zhou's hands. At that time, not a single cent was distributed. In the 21st year, the Red bandits besieged the city for several months, and many people lived on bran, and countless people starved to death. Zhou still did not distribute a single cent, and no grain was distributed. In the 22nd year, 427 disaster merchants repeatedly urged Zhou to distribute the funds, but he still did not. This year, the market is declining and there is a drought for thousands of miles. Most of the disaster merchants have lost their jobs and have no choice but to appeal to their superiors to order Zhou to distribute the funds for relief.</p>

<h3>A Review of the Past Year in Jiangsu Province by Chen Guofu</h3>
<p>Entrusted with a mission, Guofu and others have humbly presided over the administration of Jiangsu Province since assuming office last October. Time flies, and a year has passed in a blink. Considering my own dullness and incompetence, how could I be fit for such a difficult task? However, bearing in mind my service to the Party, I should absolutely obey the Party's commands and not value personal freedom. Furthermore, with the constant encouragement from the central leadership and local comrades, and deeply aware of the perilous state of the current situation, I felt a greater sense of responsibility. Thus, forgetting my clumsiness, I strove to serve diligently, day and night, hoping to exhaust my meager abilities to live up to the expectations of my fellow Jiangsu Province elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and aunts-in-law. In all major matters such as promoting prosperity, eliminating corruption, ensuring the people's welfare, and observing officials, I have exerted myself to the fullest extent within the limits of my plans, regardless of the success or failure of the matter.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province was once known as a region rich in wealth and a place where culture flourished. However, in recent years, the country has faced many misfortunes and has not yet been reorganized. Water and drought occur frequently, and the people are suffering greatly. In terms of active construction, there is a severe lack of both manpower and financial resources. In terms of passively eliminating corruption, I also feel that accumulated habits are too deeply ingrained and difficult to change. In this environment, I can only lead my colleagues to work diligently day and night, using diligence to compensate for my own deficiencies. If my colleagues can devote just a bit more effort, the local area will benefit just a bit more. Therefore, even in routine administrative affairs, I dare not be the slightest bit negligent. I fear that there may be something I have not done adequately and that I will disappoint the people of Jiangsu. As for major revolutionary plans, I have consulted widely and thoroughly. I have not dared to neglect the suggestions from local areas and the appeals from the public. I have strived to investigate them carefully, seeking out even the most hidden details. Once a decision is made and implemented, I am willing to take full responsibility. I will certainly not waver due to the difficulties of the environment, and I will certainly not stoop to personal gain or loss and seek advantages or avoid disadvantages. This is my humble intention, which I dare to announce to my fellow Jiangsu Province elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and aunts-in-law.</p>
<p>The aim of the National Revolution is to use destruction as a precursor to construction, and construction must be the backup to destruction. Just like with rotten grass and weedy wasteland, we must first sweep it away with a fierce fire, and then plow and cultivate it, so that good seedlings can grow. Now is the time to plow and cultivate. We should use the mindset of construction to complete the work of the revolution. As for administrative habits, procrastination and perfunctoriness, seeking only to do nothing wrong and thus protect one’s position, the officials closest to the people are the magistrates, but those who hold these positions today often consider skillful writing and superficial actions as their forte. Local evil forces also take advantage of this situation, making it so that the virtuous dare not do anything, while the unworthy turn this into an opportunity for profit. The orders from the upper levels of government cannot be implemented, and good laws and intentions all become mere scraps of paper. The operation of politics has lost its function, and the grievances of the people cannot be communicated. Therefore, I believe that unless those who are now in government all undergo a complete transformation, clearly recognize their responsibilities, and act with sincerity and real effort, once they have said it, they should put it into action, follow the right path of the revolutionary process together, and strive for constructive work, it will be to no avail. Therefore, on the one hand, we sincerely seek out talented people through open means, and at the same time, we cultivate and nurture, creating an atmosphere to clear out the muddy and raise the clear, and to revitalize politics. Since ancient times, the key to governing has been to obtain talented people. My colleagues and I recognize this as the greatest responsibility of the provincial government, and we dare not forget it for a moment, day and night.</p>
<p>In governing, there are matters of urgency and matters that can be delayed, and there is a proper order to the measures taken. My colleagues and I believe that there are three major principles of local politics: preservation, nurturing, and education. Jiangsu Province has suffered from disasters and hunger and is left with accumulated ills. The people are scattered, and bandits are lurking. Ensuring security is undoubtedly the most urgent task. "Teach after becoming rich" is an ancient saying, and today, the order of priorities is no different. This is what my colleagues and I have been racking our brains over, thinking and planning about, since the beginning of the year. Now, I will further elaborate on the outlines of the measures and their significance to my elders, brothers, and those who are concerned about the administration of Jiangsu.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Preservation: Jiangsu Province originally had security equipment to maintain public order, mainly in two categories: the military and the police. Since last October, in addition to implementing separate training and inspections for the provincial security team, dismissing the old and weak, and strengthening the organization to increase the real strength of bandit suppression, the county police teams were also organized independently by each county. The strength was weak and the training was sparse. The defense corps in each county were also of uneven quality, and the organization was disorganized. In order to implement strict training and unified command, we resolutely reformed, reorganized the county police teams and defense corps into security teams, with the county magistrate serving as the commander, so that they could take full responsibility. The number of teams was determined based on the county's financial resources and the complexity of its defense, and strict training was implemented, weeding out the weak and retaining the strong. Once there was an alarm in the locality, encirclement and suppression were not divided by boundaries, the orders were unified, and the discipline was clear. Moreover, with the regulations established by Chairman Chiang, the chairman also serves as the commander of the provincial security, and the administrative inspectors of each district also serve as the commanders of the security in their respective districts. From now on, there is specific responsibility for defense and suppression throughout the province, and there is also a unified organization for local defense matters. Like an arm using its fingers, the pulses are connected throughout. Protecting the territory and securing the people will definitely have real benefits. This is regarding the military aspect. The original public security equipment on the water and land in Jiangsu Province was merely a facade. The salaries were insufficient, the equipment was dilapidated, and the training was even more sparse. These are all undeniable facts. Now, we will first seek preliminary improvements to the current situation, to strengthen the forces, streamline the organization, determine the salaries, and plan the organization. Then, we will strictly train and eliminate the weak, paying attention to qualitative improvement. This is regarding the police aspect. Maintaining public order certainly relies on the military and police, but improving the people's self-defense organizations is even more urgently needed. Unless we implement the Baojia system, so that the people can regulate each other for good and watch out for each other, there is no way to ensure the safety of the neighborhoods and eliminate banditry in its infancy. Therefore, we have revised the regulations for checking household registrations and organizing the Baojia system in this province, as well as other relevant regulations, and have successively ordered the counties in both Jiangnan and Jiangbei to carry them out. This is regarding the people's self-defense organizations. Our country is pervaded by opium, which not only destroys production and hinders public order, but is enough to damage the national foundation and destroy the nation. Therefore, for the sake of protecting the people, the prohibition of opium is an urgent task. In the past, although the prohibitions were strict, they were generally carried out as a formality, deceiving ourselves, and highly addictive drugs such as morphine and heroin have risen up in their place, causing even greater harm than opium. Before we received the clear order from the central government to place the ten-province prohibition of opium under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission, we had already made the greatest determination to establish opium prohibition committees at the provincial and county levels, clearly defining policies and stipulating annual prohibition methods. Later, after receiving the opium prohibition and highly addictive drugs regulations promulgated by Chairman Chiang, we had even more grounds to follow and implement them earnestly. We have carefully observed the actual conditions of society and deeply understand the depth of the people's ingrained habits, and we are determined that it cannot be eradicated quickly in a short time, nor can it be effective through empty words. Therefore, we have made this thorough, down-to-earth plan to eliminate opium completely year by year. However, this matter is complicated and burdensome, and if we want it to be effective, those who are engaged in it must be loyal and unwavering, and not fear difficulties and obstacles. We also hope that society will give it just sympathy and multifaceted assistance. This is regarding the policies of opium and drug prohibition, and the government vows to do its utmost with utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Nurturing: Since the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the people's livelihood in Jiangsu has been extremely depressed. The collapse of the rural economy and the depletion of social finance have increased day by day, forming a state of complete bankruptcy. The main reasons for this are the lack of maintenance of water conservancy and the decline of agricultural production, while the continuous defeat of foreign trade, social extravagance, and a sharp increase in imports are also contributing factors. Now, when we talk about governing, taking recuperation as the initial approach and construction and revival as the ultimate goal is undoubtedly the right way. From the moment Guofu took office, he deeply believed that nurturing the people means wealth, and building the country means agriculture. The focus of implementation is only on reducing expenditures and increasing revenues. First, let's talk about reducing expenditures. The first step is to strive for a balance between government revenue and expenditure. Tightening measures have been frequently implemented in various provinces and counties. Although there are endless undertakings to be carried out, we must consider the burden on the people's resources, and no further increases can be made. Therefore, the government's spending must be as frugal as possible. However, the ills of the fiscal system in the past are not just the embezzlement and corruption of officials and clerks, but also the misappropriation and embezzlement by officials, which is a major cause of the depletion of the treasury. In order to block loopholes, we are also working hard to improve financial administration, implementing a treasury system, unifying the accounting system, implementing auditing, and unifying micro-collection, hoping that the ills of encroachment can be eliminated and a path to recovery can be found. As for increasing revenue, it must rely on productive construction. Before it can be fully implemented, we should first start with disaster relief and financial regulation. The problem in rural areas is that the marketing and sales of products are inconvenient, and financial turnover is not flexible, so that the price of agricultural products cannot be raised and farmers' consumption cannot be saved, and their lives are often in distress. This is already the case in normal times, and when they encounter water and drought disasters, they are simply left to die. In light of this situation, Guofu believes that it is necessary to organize agricultural product marketing cooperatives and manage agricultural warehouses for storage and pledging. Therefore, the Farmers Bank has repeatedly dispatched specialists to various places to jointly promote effective measures with the local governments and agricultural education institutions. With the gradual progress of the marketing cooperation business, the warehousing and pledging have also been actively increased. With this huge amount of funds being dispersed and flowing into rural areas, although it may not be possible to immediately achieve a state of restoration and prosperity, the activity of finance is indeed far better than before. Moreover, as the news spreads, many commercial banks are also imitating, and if it is promoted to the point of covering the entire province in the future, the direct and indirect benefits to the national economy will be enormous, and it will certainly not be just the farmers who benefit. As for productive construction, water conservancy is the most important. Since the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), Jiangsu Province has been followed by this year's severe drought, and the people have become even more aware of the need to build water conservancy. Once there is a leader, the local people will respond enthusiastically and its promotion is very easy. However, due to funding and time constraints, we can only prioritize what is most urgent and then gradually proceed with other projects. For example, repairing and dredging the Liutang River, repairing the Jiangnan seawall, managing the Wangzhu Yugang tide gate project, and the recent efforts to organize drought relief through public works, as well as the preliminary project to guide the Huai River into the sea, etc. Next is the highway. Jiangsu Province has already paid attention to this several years ago, and it has gradually taken shape through advocacy. We will continue to operate and strive for advancement. During this year, a total of seventeen roads have been continued and started to be built. The next is the telephone, which is of great importance to military and commercial relations. In recent years, the operating performance has been successful. Hundreds of kilometers of telephone lines have also been opened in the counties north of the Yangtze River. The next is to promote rural sideline occupations. The decline of agricultural products in recent years has not only led to a sharp decline in the output of major food crops, but also to a slump in sideline occupations. My colleagues have carefully considered and deliberated, and feel that promoting rural sideline occupations is indeed an essential plan for the current situation of rescuing the declining situation and subsidizing production. Therefore, it was resolved to organize a Design Committee to promote rural sideline occupations in Jiangbei. Since agricultural production in the counties north of the Yangtze River is far worse than in the south, we are prioritizing what is most urgent. The situation regarding nurturing is briefly as described above. Because benefiting the people and enriching their lives is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditures, eliminating accumulated ills is the key to reducing expenditures, and productive construction is the foundation of increasing revenue. We foolishly believe that we must all work together on this, and then the resources will be abundant, the people will be prosperous, and education can be implemented. As for land administration, it is also an important task for developing construction and prospering the economy. In the past year, we have promoted the sorting of land registration, the determination of land prices, the adjustment of land rights, and the development of land benefits, hoping to eliminate the accumulated ills of officials and clerks and establish a great plan for a hundred years. This is another example of reducing expenditures and increasing revenues, planning and considering both, all of which belong to the matter of nurturing. (3) Regarding Education: The order of nurturing and education has been described above, but this does not mean that when we are engaged in preserving and nurturing, we do not need education. It is only that the results are achieved in different orders. Administrative measures should certainly pay attention to preserving and nurturing the people on the one hand, and also pay attention to improving education on the other. Not only that, but the methods of improving education must also be compatible with the policies of preservation and nurturing. Survival is the original requirement of all living things. The meaning of education and nurturing lies in enhancing the ability of human beings to live, so that everyone is fit to survive, and enjoy progressive and meaningful lives. Therefore, it is said that between national education and university education, a stage of life education should be specially set up. On the one hand, it cultivates citizens who can live independently, and on the other hand, it cultivates the spirit of respecting work and enjoying community life, and deeply understands the meaning of human coexistence, co-prosperity, cooperation and mutual assistance. By extending the satisfaction of individual life to the entire society, the entire national life can be elevated to a state of well-being. We have cherished this for many years, but have not been able to realize it. Fortunately, education in Jiangsu has always been developed, and the manpower and financial resources should be sufficient to implement it. Therefore, it has been stipulated that life schools should be tried out in Jiangdu, and education in life skills should be implemented according to the local products, so as to improve education and improve production. Once there are achievements, it will be gradually promoted to other counties, each according to its production environment. As for the original production education, it will still be expanded as appropriate. In terms of social education, we will focus on the implementation of livelihood education, hoping to correspond to the nurturing policy, and seek to improve the lives of the people of Jiangsu. Other administrative aspects, such as the facilities for training talents, include the establishment of military and police cadre training centers for military and police cadres, and the establishment of township head training centers for local autonomous personnel in each administrative supervision district. We are preparing to set up county assistant training centers for county assistant personnel, and police training centers for school police squad leaders. All of this is to cultivate the basic talents for various administrative levels and to benefit the promotion of politics. I also see that the lack of attention to public health in society affects the future of national survival, and that health administration urgently needs to be carefully planned. Therefore, in order to cultivate such specialists, we are specially preparing to set up a medical and political college to promote and create, which is all that can be recorded of the educational matters in the past year.</p>
<p>Guofu, together with all the committee members and my colleagues in office, have made the above efforts together in the past year. I certainly dare not be confident that everything we have done is perfect, but it is only the sincerity of serving the people of Jiangsu, promoting prosperity and eliminating corruption, and hoping to move from decline to prosperity, and from destruction to construction. We will not dare to exhaust one point of energy, and we will not dare to waste one inch of time. We treat it with perseverance and carry it out with sincerity. That is all. All my enlightened colleagues, please offer guidance and encouragement, which is what my colleagues and I sincerely seek and gladly accept. (October 12, 1934)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Grain Storage Loan Successfully Concluded</h3>
<p>To be undertaken by Shanghai, Jiaotong, Jiangsu, and Farmers Banks</p>
<p>Total Amount of 1.8 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Contract Has Begun to Be Signed</p>
<p>In order to regulate the food supply and store grain against famine, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has contacted Shanghai, Jiaotong, Jiangsu, and Farmers Banks to negotiate a loan to purchase food. It is learned that the loan has been successfully concluded, with a total amount of 1.8 million yuan. The Jiangsu Provincial Government recognizes 360,000 yuan, totaling 2.16 million yuan. The contract has begun to be signed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial authorities, considering that the counties in southern Jiangsu have suffered from prolonged drought this year, while the counties in northern Jiangsu have mostly had average harvests, intend to raise 3 million yuan as a standard for regulating the food supply. They sent personnel to Gaoyou, BinYing, and other counties to purchase sugar. Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Finance Department and concurrently the Director of the Agricultural Warehouse Management Office, contacted the Zhenjiang branches of Shanghai, Jiaotong, Farmers, and Jiangsu Banks to negotiate a loan of 2 million yuan. The remaining 1 million yuan would be raised by the Finance Department. After several negotiations, the loan amount was changed to 1.8 million yuan, to be undertaken separately by the four banks. The Jiangsu Provincial Government recognized 360,000 yuan, totaling 2.16 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank Undertakings</h3>
<p>The amounts to be undertaken by each bank have been determined as follows: Shanghai Bank 600,000 yuan, Jiaotong Bank 600,000 yuan, Jiangsu Bank 240,000 yuan, and Farmers Bank 360,000 yuan, totaling 1.8 million yuan. The Jiangsu Provincial Government recognizes 20%, or 360,000 yuan, totaling 2.16 million yuan. The loan interest rate is 1%, and the term is one year. The purchased food will be used as collateral. Each undertaking bank may send personnel to assist in the purchase and be responsible for payment matters.</p>
<h3>Signing of Contract</h3>
<p>After the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the undertaking banks separately determined the loan amounts, they immediately proceeded to negotiate the loan contract, which has been completely agreed upon. It is divided into two copies, each loan being 900,000 yuan, distributed as follows: (1) Shanghai Bank 600,000 yuan, Jiangsu Bank 240,000 yuan, and Farmers Bank 60,000 yuan; (2) Jiaotong Bank 600,000 yuan, and Farmers Bank 300,000 yuan. The content of the contract is exactly the same. According to the Xinxin News Agency reporter, the contract has been signed by Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Finance Department, with the Zhenjiang branches of each undertaking bank in Zhenjiang since the 11th.</p>
<h3>Reporting to Head Office</h3>
<p>After the Zhenjiang branches of each undertaking bank signed the Jiangsu Province Grain Storage Loan contract in Zhenjiang, they immediately reported to their respective Shanghai head offices. As of yesterday, Shanghai and Jiaotong Banks had received reports of the signed contract. Jiangsu and Farmers Banks have not yet received reports, and are expected to be in the process of signing. It is also heard that the Finance Department will send the signed contracts to the four undertaking banks for separate safekeeping as soon as the contract is completed.</p>
<h3>Commencing Purchases</h3>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reporter learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Government, as the loan has now been successfully concluded and the new grain in the counties north of the Yangtze River has already entered the market, plans to send specialists to Gaoyou, BinYing, Huai'an, Taizhou, and other counties to start purchasing immediately. As for the purchase funds, the Provincial Government will first use the 20% of 360,000 yuan that it recognizes, and may draw on the banks undertaking the loan as needed depending on the circumstances in the future.</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton Mill Association Appeals for</p>
<h3>Exemption from Increased Cotton Yarn Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>Weak Purchasing Power, the Yarn Industry is Already Declining</p>
<p>Selling at Reduced Prices, Manufacturers Cannot Afford the Burden</p>
<p>According to XinSheng News Agency, recently, due to the Ministry of Finance's proposed increase in the cotton yarn consolidated tax, and the rumor that it will be implemented from November 1st, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, specially sent a letter on the 8th of this month to Director Wu of the Taxation Administration, asking him to forward it to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, pleading for exemption. The Hubei branch of the association also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Taxation Administration, and the Cotton Consolidated Tax Association, making an appeal. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<h3>Letter to the Taxation Administration</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association sent a letter to Director Wu of the Taxation Administration yesterday, stating: "Regarding the Minister's proposal to increase the cotton yarn consolidated tax, we are extremely alarmed upon hearing the news. Since the implementation of the consolidated tax in our country's cotton textile industry, due to the poor quality of the grades and the weak purchasing power, it has already been declining day by day. Recently, with the increase in import duties on cotton and the reduction in taxes on cotton products, it is in an even more precarious situation. If it is said that the increased tax is borne by the consumer and has nothing to do with the manufacturer, it is not known that in recent years, there have been repeated droughts and floods, and the countryside has gone bankrupt. Selling at cost price has still not been paid attention to. If the price is raised again, there will be even fewer people interested. What was intended to be imposed on the consumer will inevitably have to be borne by the manufacturer in the end. When manufacturers reduce prices to sell to each other, the losses will become increasingly serious, and they will inevitably go bankrupt. The consolidated tax revenue will then be exhausted. We specially appeal to you to persuade the Minister to grant an exemption from the increase. We offer our public friendship, and this is addressed to Director Wu of the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>The Hubei branch of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting exemption from the cotton yarn consolidated tax. The original telegram stated: "Recently, we heard from Shanghai that the Ministry of Finance has proposed to increase the consolidated tax on cotton yarn and cloth from November 1st. We are extremely alarmed upon hearing the news. Previously, because the association felt that the consolidated tax grades were too slightly different for coarse and fine yarns, which was convenient for foreign merchants and unfavorable to Chinese factories, it had appealed to request a revision. Your Ministry believed that the consolidated tax system was established by the Legislative Yuan, and it was difficult to change it, which has led to delays until now. Foreign merchants inevitably bear less of the burden than Chinese factories. However, since the consolidated tax system was approved by the Legislative Yuan and cannot be changed, its tax rate should also be in accordance with the original determination and cannot be increased suddenly. The reasoning is very clear. Moreover, the textile industry has been in an extremely depressed state in recent years due to rural bankruptcy and weak purchasing power. Recently, with the increase in import duties on cotton and the reduction in taxes on cotton products, all kinds of restrictions have become even more unbearable. How can we bear the pain of increased taxes? If it is said that the increased tax is passed on to consumers, it is not known that the markets in various places are all oversupplied, and it is still difficult to sell even at cost price. If the price is raised again, there will be no one interested. What was intended to be imposed on the consumer must still be borne by the manufacturer in the end. The members of the association are in an environment like a seriously ill person, unable to survive. If they are subjected to heavy burdens again, they will inevitably tend towards complete bankruptcy. Once the manufacturers close down, the consolidated tax revenue will also be exhausted. This case of increasing the consolidated tax, not only does the association swear that it is difficult to accept, but even if it is resolutely implemented, the government's tax revenue will also have concerns about being in deficit. It is unfavorable to merchants and unfavorable to officials. What good can it possibly be? The association members are dying, and have reached the most difficult juncture. Your Ministry must give special support, so that they can barely prolong their lives. In this dangerous period, they cannot bear even the slightest increase in burden. Moreover, reading the newspapers, it is said that the government wants to rescue the yarn industry, and it has been publicized for a long time. We are even more unwilling to suddenly increase taxes, which would violate the original intention of rescue and promote the collapse of the factories. We present this with trepidation and urgency. We hope that you will review and verify it. The Hubei branch of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association bows."</p>
<h3>Luo Wen'gan Resigns, Wang Fuxin Replies</h3>
<p>Successor Still Undecided</p>
<p>According to HePing News Agency, Luo Wen'gan, Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Zheng Tianxi, Political Vice Minister, and Shi Zhiquan, Permanent Vice Minister, have successively submitted their resignations to the Executive Yuan. President Wang has also replied. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Luo Wen'gan submitted a resignation, stating that his physical condition is deteriorating and he respectfully requests approval to resign in order to recuperate. He wrote: "I, Wen'gan, have been honored to be promoted and have been able to serve diligently. Since taking office, it has been almost three years in an instant. I believe that I have achieved nothing and have long thought of resigning. I have repeatedly presented my feelings to you in person and have been given insight. Now, I have received repeated telegrams from home urging me to return, and there are various family matters that need my attention. I have been frequently ill in recent years, and the signs of decline have already formed. If I continue to hold this arduous post for a long time, it will be difficult to sustain. I would like to request approval to dismiss me from the position of Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, so that I can have a long-term rest and return home to take care of family affairs, which will be convenient for both public and private matters. I humbly await your review and approval. This is presented to President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Luo Wen'gan, Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration."</p>
<h3>Wang's Reply to Luo</h3>
<p>To Minister Luo Wen'gan and Vice Ministers Zheng Tianxi and Shi Zhiquan, esteemed colleagues, Upon receiving your resignations, I am filled with regret. Since you, Wen'gan and the two Vice Ministers, have been in office, you have been known to your colleagues and seen by the world for your integrity and uprightness. And you, Vice Ministers Zheng and Shi, have worked together with one heart and mind, complementing each other. I deeply admire your achievements. Recently, according to the resolutions of the Central Political Council and the Central Executive Committee, the Organization Law of the National Government has been revised, and the Ministry of Administration under the same law has been transferred to the Judicial Yuan. Your resignation letters have been sent to President Ju of the Judicial Yuan for review and decision. Here, I would like to sincerely express my friendship as colleagues who have shared joys and hardships for three years to the three of you, and wish you health. I hope you will take care.</p>

<p>Detained in Fujian</p>
<h3>The "Shun An" Steamer to Be Released</h3>
<p>Chen Yi Telegraphs Approval for Release</p>
<p>Important Suspects to Be Sent to Shanghai</p>
<p>The "New Voice Society" reports: Regarding the detention of the "Shun An" steamer by the Customs of Sandu, Fujian, due to the conspiracy of company manager Chen Youbai to sabotage the ship, as reported in previous editions, after the company's chairman Zheng Zhongwu arrested Chen Youbai and sent him to the court, the Inspector General of Customs, based on the company's request, has telegraphed the Sandu Customs to release the ship. However, the Civil Affairs Department of Fujian Province ordered the water police to take the ship to Fuzhou, and the ship's staff, including Ou Tai, were arrested. The company's chairman, Zheng Zhongwu, went to Fujian a few days ago to request the release of the ship, so that passengers would not be detained on board for too long, and the cargo would not rot. Meanwhile, he requested the local shipping association to send a telegram to request this. It is now reported that Chairman Chen of the Fujian Provincial Government has replied by telegram, agreeing to release the ship, and that the important suspects, such as Ouyang Tai, will be requested by the Shanghai District Court from Fujian to be sent to Shanghai for interrogation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association Telegram to Chen: The Shanghai Shipping Association addressed to Chairman Chen of the Fujian Provincial Government, Fuzhou Provincial Government, Chairman Chen, esteemed sir: According to the chairman of the member "Shun An" Steamship Company, Zheng Zhongwu, the "Shun An" steamer was detained by the Sandu Customs due to the manager and captain conspiring to damage the ship. Now, our company has detained the manager, Chen Youbai, and sent him to the Shanghai District Court for legal processing. The Inspector General of Customs has telegraphed the Sandu Fuhai Customs to release the ship to Xinghua to unload cargo and then return to Shanghai for processing in accordance with regulations. At this moment, the Sandu water police, following orders from the General Team, are escorting the ship and personnel to the province for investigation. The ship is carrying passengers and cargo from Shanghai to Xinghua. Due to this incident, the losses have been significant. If the delay continues, everything will be completely moldy and rotten. Please telegraph the provincial government to swiftly order the release. It has been verified that the incident involving the "Shun An" ship is being handled by the customs and the Shanghai District Court. It is urgently hoped that the steamer and captain will be returned to Shanghai for verification to clarify the truth, as the passengers and cargo on board have been detained for a long time, resulting in extremely high losses. Therefore, according to the situation, we earnestly implore you to allow a telegram to be sent to the Sandu water police to swiftly release the "Shun An" steamer and crew in full. We deeply await your response. With respect, Yu Hede, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Shipping Association, bows respectfully.</p>
<p>Chen's Reply to the Shipping Association: Telegram to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association: Your telegram has been received. It has been verified that the Civil Affairs Department previously ordered the water police brigade to send the persons involved to the province for interrogation. We have now ordered them to expedite the delivery of Ouyang Tai and important witnesses to the province. As for the ship, cargo, and passengers, we have also ordered an investigation. If the Inspector General of Customs has ordered the release, everything should be released immediately. Chen Yi, Jia Min Er Yin.</p>

<p>Municipal Government, Etc.</p>
<h3>Continued Discussions Yesterday on Dredging the Wusong River</h3>
<p>It Was Decided That the Chamber of Commerce Would Convene Relevant Industries to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Wusong River is crucial for transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. However, due to years of neglect in dredging, ships are prone to encountering obstacles. Recognizing this, the Shanghai Municipal Government has consulted with groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss dredging methods and has decided on a budget of 200,000 yuan, with the Municipal Government allocating 50,000 yuan and the remaining amount to be raised by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce subsequently reported the difficulty in raising funds to the Municipal Government for review. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Municipal Government reconvened the various groups for further discussion. Those present included Pan Xusheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Xu Guansan from the Public Works Bureau, Wang Bofen, Yang Youlong, and Wan Yongsheng from the Shipping Association, etc., chaired by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun. After discussion, it was recognized that dredging the Wusong River is a matter of great importance for transportation, and it was decided to follow the previous method: the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will convene relevant industries such as rice, flour, timber, silk, yarn, coal, and inland steamers to discuss fundraising methods. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Replies to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Foreign Goods Must Not Use Chinese Trademarks</h3>
<p>Violators Will Be Prosecuted for Deceiving the Public</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Rubber, Hardware, and Vehicle Materials Association stating that some people are changing the trademarks of imported goods to Chinese trademarks and requesting clarification as to whether there are explicit laws prohibiting this. As there were no explicit legal provisions, the Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry for clarification. The Chamber has now received a reply from the Ministry. The original telegram and instructions are recorded as follows: Chamber of Commerce Telegram: Ministry of Industry, Nanjing, esteemed sirs: If a factory registers its own manufactured goods under a trademark, obtaining exclusive rights, and at the same time uses its trademark on privately sold foreign goods, passing them off as Chinese goods, can such a situation be considered to comply with Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Trademark Law, "deceiving the public," allowing interested parties to request an evaluation in accordance with Article 30 of the same law to invalidate the registered trademark? We respectfully request instructions. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jiang, respectfully.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Instructions: Your telegram has been received. Article 1 of the Trademark Law stipulates that anyone wishing to exclusively use a trademark to represent goods they have produced, manufactured, processed, selected, wholesaled, or brokered should apply for registration in accordance with this law. Therefore, the use of a trademark is not limited to one's own manufactured goods. However, if there is indeed a situation as described in your telegram, where one has obtained exclusive trademark rights for their own manufactured goods and at the same time uses the trademark on privately imported foreign goods, passing them off as Chinese goods, this naturally complies with Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Trademark Law, "deceiving the public." According to the information presented, we hereby approve your request for information. This approval.</p>

<h3>News on Disaster Relief for the Drought</h3>
<p>In this drought disaster, the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee considers Zhejiang Province to be the most severely affected, with Haining County being the most severely affected area within Zhejiang. On Tuesday of this week, the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee at 97 Renji Road convened a board meeting, deciding to prioritize relief efforts for Haining, addressing the most urgent needs. However, the scope is too broad, the costs are enormous, and the financial situation is dire, making it difficult to support alone. It has been agreed that the Haining Native Place Association in Shanghai will raise 20,000 yuan, the Chinese Jisheng Association will raise 10,000 yuan, and the Relief Committee will also raise 10,000 yuan, for a total of 40,000 yuan, to be used jointly. However, this amount is only sufficient to assist two of the most severely affected districts out of the five districts in the county. If thorough relief is desired, it is essential for charitable individuals to provide assistance collectively, as widespread relief is unlikely otherwise.</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association, due to the severe drought disasters in Liyang and Jiangpu counties, Jiangsu Province, sent Mu Jun Jialiang and Ma Jun Jintao to investigate. According to their report, Liyang County is divided into six districts, with a total of over 300,000 disaster victims. Among them, the fourth district, including Changxingbu, Shangpeibu, Qiangbu, Tangjiaqiao, etc., is the most severely affected, with approximately 9,000 households and over 30,000 people. As this district is located in the western frontier of Liyang, bordering Jurong and Lishui, the terrain is entirely mountainous. If there is water, there is a risk of erosion, and if there is a drought, there is no way to irrigate. This summer's extraordinary drought has made the disaster situation particularly severe compared to other districts. The first, second, fifth, and sixth districts are slightly flatter, with some harvests, and the disaster situation is lighter. The association plans that emergency relief for the fourth district will require approximately 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Setting up factories to distribute porridge will require five locations. For example, from November to the end of February next year, each factory will need approximately 12 shi of rice per day. Five porridge factories will need a total of 60 shi of rice. Over three months, a total of 5,400 shi of rice will be needed. The disaster situation in the three other districts is less severe than in the fourth district, with approximately 4,000 households. Setting up factories to distribute porridge will also require 2,000 shi of rice, for a total of 8,100 shi of rice. At 10 yuan per shi, the total cost will be approximately 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Jiangpu County is divided into five districts, with a total of 200,000 disaster victims, with the fourth district being the most severely affected. Taking Xinmiao Town as an example, there are over 900 disaster-stricken households, with over 3,000 people. Other villages and towns are not included. The fifth district is adjacent to the fourth district, with a slightly less severe disaster situation. The first, second, and third districts are located along the river, with some harvests. The fourth district is the most severely affected because it borders the three counties of Chu, He, and Jin in Anhui Province and has been ravaged by bandit disasters since the 13th year of the Republic, and has not yet recovered. In addition, this year's extraordinary drought has made the situation particularly severe compared to other districts. Emergency relief for the fourth district is more appropriate, requiring approximately 10,000 yuan. The relief efforts for the above two counties will require approximately 100,000 yuan. After receiving the report, the association feels helpless due to the severity of the disaster and the lack of funds. It hopes that kind-hearted people at home and abroad will come together to provide assistance to save the helpless disaster victims. The merits of such actions are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Tongxiang Drought Relief Association: Tongxiang County borders Haining and Haiyan. This summer's drought has been extraordinarily severe. Rivers have dried up, turning everything into scorched earth. The fields have cracked, making it impossible to sow seeds. All agricultural by-products have withered. Disaster victims are exchanging their children for food, and entire families are committing suicide. Such scenes are visible everywhere, making one shudder at the thought. To solicit donations from the interior, considering the declining commercial conditions in recent years, it is difficult to raise large sums. Therefore, on October 7th, legal entities publicly elected county party representatives Liu Jiahou, County Magistrate Shen Guangxiong, Shen Qiluo, and Shen Songsheng to come to Shanghai to discuss emergency relief measures with fellow Tongxiang natives living in Shanghai. On October 9th, Jian Quan, Xu Guannan, and Xu Xiaoxia invited fellow Tongxiang natives living in Shanghai to a meeting at the Xu residence on North Zhejiang Road. County Magistrate Shen presided over the meeting, reporting on the initial relief efforts to combat the drought and their failure, as well as presenting the provincial plan and appealing to fellow natives living abroad to assist in disaster relief and jointly implement measures. Liu Jiahou then elaborated on the severe disaster situation in the county, which has not been seen in nearly a century. Those present included County Magistrate Shen Guangxiong, Shen Luyi, Yan Shaohe, Yan Duhe, Cheng Zhihe, Cheng Muhao, Chen Kui Sheng, Zhang Zounong, Xu Xuying, Hu Yangqian, Xu Pinshao, Lu Fei Bohong, Xia Jin Hou, and others, totaling over ten people. It was decided on the spot to first raise funds for emergency grain distribution. All labor-intensive projects, including county-wide water conservancy, will be discussed further after the provincial government allocates funds. Just for distributing wheat seeds and providing rice, even with a reduced plan, at least 100,000 yuan is needed. In fact, there are over 40,000 people in the county who cannot survive without assistance. Donation registers were filled out on the spot, totaling 4,150 yuan. Such a small contribution is like a drop in the bucket. Fellow natives living abroad are requested to assist in fundraising. Other fellow natives are scattered abroad, and their addresses are unknown. After their addresses are verified, donation registers will be sent to them one after another. It was also decided that the relief association's Shanghai liaison office and donation collection point would be Xu's residence at 61 North Zhejiang Road, north of the Old Garbage Bridge in Shanghai. At the same time, Zhang Zhuxian and Xia Jinhou were appointed to handle documentation and general affairs to jointly implement the measures.</p>
<p>Hubei natives from all walks of life in Shanghai are making tireless efforts to rescue disaster victims in their province from floods and droughts. It is recently reported that the Hubei Native Place Association, in addition to appointing Wu Xingya to return to Hubei and negotiate with the provincial government on issuing disaster relief bonds, has recently appointed Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Shaocheng, Han Juemin, and Li Xingchen (representing Wu Xingya) to deliver official letters from the Hubei Provincial Government and visit Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, and others, requesting Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang to perform charity shows to raise funds. Du, Huang, and others expressed their strong support and agreed to help plan the date and location of Mei and Ma's performances, which will be held within a few days. This year's drought is widespread, especially severe in Hubei Province. Now that Du and others are helping to raise funds, allowing over 3 million disaster victims in Hubei to share the joy of coming back to life, it is also good news for disaster victims awaiting aid.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company</p>
<h3>Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Elected Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company, Ltd., since the establishment of its preparatory office last year, has, over the past year, had its preparatory committee members raise funds separately, and the preparations are now complete. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the inaugural meeting was held in the meeting room of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Over 50 shareholders attended, approved the articles of association, and elected directors and supervisors. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Shareholders Attending: Yesterday's meeting was attended by shareholders including Zhu Jia, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Guo Shun, Liu Zhengkang, Zhang Gongquan, Shi Liangcai, Ge Huarong, Wu Tiecheng, Xu Peihuang, Yang Hu, Wang Shixiong, Yu Yanbin, Wang Tianzeng, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Danru, Hu Jinqing, Zhang Senlin, Zhao Chengyi, Wu Shenqing, Wu Jianzhou, Zhang Youkun, Zhu Fuxian, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Yunbo, Wang Guyan, Xu Xinliu, and Wu Huanru and Wang from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, totaling over 60 people.</p>
<p>Meeting Order: (1) Opening the meeting with a bell; (2) Electing a temporary chairman; (3) Paying the highest respect to the party and national flags and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (4) The chairman respectfully reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will; (5) The chairman's report; (6) The supervisor's speech; (7) The report by the representative of the initiators on the company's preparation process; (8) Discussion of the company's articles of association; (9) Publicly appointing ballot counters; (10) Electing directors and supervisors; (11) Discussion of other matters; (12) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After opening the meeting with a bell, Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as chairman. The chairman led the attendees in performing the required ceremonies, and then gave a report, stating that today's meeting was the inaugural meeting of the company, and he thanked the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for sending representatives to attend and provide guidance. He reported that the company's preparations have taken over a year, and the efforts of all involved have been successful. The company has also filed with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The filing with the Shanghai Municipal Government will be completed separately. There were 58 people present today, holding 500,435 shares, which is sufficient for a quorum. The meeting could begin.</p>
<p>Representative's Speech: Then, Wu Huanru, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, saying that he was very pleased to be ordered to attend the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company. In recent times, science has flourished, and transportation has seen daily development. However, compared with the major powers of Europe and the United States, China's development is still far behind. Shanghai is the transportation center of East Asia, with goods entering and leaving, and passengers traveling back and forth, particularly crowded. Jiangsu Province is a region of rich resources in our country. However, it only relies on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which is only a single track, and is insufficient for current needs. Therefore, alternative solutions should be sought. Now, the opening of the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus not only provides convenience for travelers along the route, but also, in this time of agricultural decline, the convenience of this transportation route can allow Shanghai's industry and commerce to expand into the interior, and allow agricultural products from the interior to be transported to Shanghai as much as possible. Therefore, the opening of this route has a great relationship with both Shanghai and Jiangsu provinces, and remedying the decline of the countryside is a particularly urgent task. Therefore, it can sufficiently demonstrate the concern of your company for local social undertakings.</p>
<p>Passing the Articles of Association: After the report was completed, the discussion of the company's articles of association began. After the chairman read each article, made minor amendments, they were passed. The general assembly also set the annual transportation allowance for the chairman and other directors as follows: Chairman, 1,000 yuan; directors, 400 yuan; supervisors, 200 yuan; managing directors, 600 yuan, paid once a year. After the discussion was completed, ballots were distributed, and the chairman appointed Zhang Gongquan, Xu Peihuang, Chen Guangfu, and Wu Jianzhou as ballot counters to begin the election.</p>
<p>Election Results: The election results were: (A) Directors: Wang Xiaolai (42703 votes), Qian Xinzhi (42525 votes), Liu Hongsheng (42485 votes), Du Yuesheng (41791 votes), Chen Guangfu (4090 votes), Yu Qiaqing (40682 votes), Xu Peihuang (39626 votes), Zhang Xiaolin (39349 votes), Chen Qinshi (24500 votes), Guo Shun (23643 votes), Zhang Danru (22732 votes), Wu Tiecheng (22339 votes), Kong Yongzhi (22303 votes), Yu Hongjun (20850 votes), Shi Liangcai (20247 votes) (15 people total). (B) Supervisors: Jin Tingsun (37082 votes), Lin Kanghou (21311 votes), Xi Ehan (20341 votes), Wu Qiding (20298 votes), Lu Bohong (20026 votes), You Jusheng (1986 votes), Wu Jianzhou (19462 votes) (7 people total).</p>
<p>Preparation Process: On September 2nd of last year, Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram initiating the project with a pre-estimated road construction and vehicle operation capital of 1.5 million yuan. A discussion meeting of initiators was immediately convened, and on October 12th, the initiators' meeting elected 11 preparatory committee members. From these 11 members, one chairman and four standing committee members were selected, and a preparatory office was established at the Shenxin Company on Jiangding West Road to prepare everything. On October 10th, the chairman personally went to Zhenjiang to contact the Jiangsu Construction Department regarding road construction matters. On November 30th, filings were submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government. In December, approvals No. 1502 from the Shanghai Municipal Government and No. 142 Jianzi from the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Construction Department were received. Subsequently, on December 19th, the third preparatory committee meeting was held, with Chen Ticheng, director of the Road Bureau of the National Economic Council, attending to promote the road project, which was to be managed by government agencies, with construction funds to be borrowed separately by the company and the Economic Committee. On February 7th of this year, the fifth standing committee meeting was held, with Jiangsu Construction Director Shen Baixian and Zhao Zukang, deputy director of the Road Bureau of the National Economic Council, attending to continue negotiations to convert the road construction into a lease and negotiate a contract for exclusive operation. The preparatory committee and the initiators' meeting then conducted research on the contract for exclusive operation and the contract clauses. On April 10th, an emergency meeting of the preparatory committee was held, and a draft agreement for the exclusive operation of the Shanghai-Wuxi and Changshu roads was signed, and the division and payment of the guarantee deposit was discussed. On May 22nd, a formal contract for the exclusive operation of the Shanghai-Wuxi and Changshu roads was signed with the Jiangsu Construction Department, and a guarantee deposit of 68,000 yuan was paid. However, due to rural bankruptcy and economic panic, it was difficult to raise funds, so on June 29th, the fourth initiators' meeting was convened and decided to reduce the total capital to 1 million yuan. Also, because the road construction loan agreed upon with the Construction Department was urgently needed, and the collected capital could not be used, the eleventh preparatory committee meeting on July 14th decided to have the chairman temporarily borrow 300,000 yuan from the bank to allocate. On July 30th, a formal contract for the Shanghai section of the Shanghai-Wuxi Road was signed with the Shanghai Municipal Government, and a guarantee deposit of 10,000 yuan was paid. On August 6th, the temporary bank loan was established, and on the same day, the borrowed 300,000 yuan was paid to the Jiangsu Construction Department as a loan for the second phase of road construction for the Shanghai-Wuxi and Changshu roads. On September 18th, the chairman invited Du Yuesheng and other committee members to Suzhou to host a banquet to raise funds. On the 30th, the chairman, along with Director Xu Peihuang, went to Wuxi to host a banquet to raise funds and inspect the completed earthworks and bridge projects. On October 3rd, they went to Changshu to host a banquet to raise funds. To date, two meetings for discussions with the initiators, four meetings of initiators, five standing committee meetings, fifteen preparatory committee meetings, and one emergency meeting of the preparatory committee have been held. A total of 590,005 yuan in capital has been collected, which meets the requirements of the Company Law, and the company can be established (omitted below).</p>

<p>More Than 300 Rent Reduction Branches</p>
<h3>Joint Letter Requesting Representative Congress</h3>
<p>Emergency Joint Meeting Held Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Rent Reduction Committee received a joint letter from more than 300 rent reduction branches throughout the city, requesting the implementation of rent reduction. The letter stated, "Respectfully submitting:</p>
<p>Rent reduction campaign, which has been disturbed for half a year, has been faced with suppression tactics from landlords, including forced collection and prosecution of rents, to the point where the court is overwhelmed and society is in an unstable situation. At a time when the commercial market is deserted, the situation is extremely dire and difficult to maintain. Continuing this way, what can we expect for the future? Rent reductions have precedents; why is Shanghai different? The branches, based on the previously issued rent reduction methods, have always supported and insisted on seeing this through to the end. No rent reduction means no rent payment. Re-investigating all tenants, depositing rents in banks in a proper manner, engaging in long-term resistance, and striving to achieve the goal of rent reduction. Now reading Chairman Chiang's instructions, directing the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle the matter, it is evident that he cares about commercial sentiment and understands commercial difficulties. The branches should unite even more, vowing to fight for rent reduction and achieve success. Otherwise, we look to your association's leadership, based on the resolutions of the congress, to make a final appeal, awakening landlords, urging them to quickly start reducing rents voluntarily, limiting the period to the shortest time possible, and expediting its realization. Accordingly, we jointly sign, respectfully requesting your association to urgently convene a congress of tenant representatives from all neighborhoods. The proposed venue is the Public Sports Field." After receiving the letter, the association, considering the magnitude of the matter, scheduled an emergency joint meeting of the</p>
<p>Executive Committee, Legal Department, and Design Department for today (the 13th) at 2 PM to discuss this important issue.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Highway Bureau</p>
<h3>Switching to Charcoal Gas Vehicles</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Test Results</p>
<p>Used for Long-Distance Buses</p>
<p>Shen Zhongliang, Director of the Jiangsu Highway Administration, concerned about the recent surge in gasoline prices and the increase in transportation costs, has been diligently studying methods to replace gasoline. Last month, he personally came to the Zhong Gas Vehicle Manufacturing Company on Huade Road in Shanghai to inspect the structure and usage methods of gas vehicles. He conducted on-site testing and calculated the consumption value, which was only one-fifth of gasoline. The results were very satisfactory. He immediately signed a contract with the company and decided to convert all long-distance buses on the province's highways to charcoal gas. It is said that the first gas vehicle departed from Shanghai to Zhen on Double Ten Day, starting its business. This is truly a dawn for the future of transportation.</p>
<p>Cargo Truck Tax Increase Case</p>
<h3>Petition Representatives Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Result</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the cargo truck industry in this city, burdened by the municipal government's 15% increase in vehicle tax, sent representatives Lou Yinchuan, Jiang Zhongying, Jiang Shuji, Ye Junhan, Qian Guoyi, and others, along with Yuan Hongjun, a representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to Beijing to petition various central party and administrative departments.

<p>Increased Property Tax by the Public Works Department</p>
<h3>Hotel Industry Expresses Firm Opposition</h3>
<p>The hotel industry, provoked by the illegal tax increase by the Public Works Department, has repeatedly expressed its opposition. As the winter tax collection period has arrived, the businesses subject to the tax increase have submitted the business tax and the original amount of property tax to the Tax Department and have received a winter business license. However, the Tax Department refused to accept the taxes and withheld the business license. All fellow hoteliers believe that the Tax Department disregards the law and insists on its own way, which is very wrong. They convened an emergency meeting the other day to discuss solutions, vowing not to yield at any cost. They notified all fellow hoteliers in the city to be calm and fight to the end until the goal is achieved. Meanwhile, they entrusted lawyer Chen Tingrui to seriously negotiate according to legal principles.</p>

<p>Normally No Women Visited</p>
<p>Suffered Great Psychological Stimuli</p>
<p>Mr. Di Shu, a British national and private secretary to the General Manager of the Public Works Department in the Public Settlement, had served the Public Works Department since October 1922 at the age of not yet forty. He was loyal to his duties, diligent and honest, and had been promoted several times to his current position. He took a vacation back home earlier this year. Mr. Li had never been married and lived alone in Shanghai. A year ago, he rented Room 10 on the third floor of the building at 1236 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, paying a monthly rent of 85 taels. Mr. Li went to the Bureau on time every day to work and returned to his residence in the evening. He lived alone and had no contact with women. The residence only employed an old servant and a shop assistant. Yesterday morning at around 9:30, Mr. Li got up to wash. When the old servant brought in breakfast as usual, he saw that Mr. Li's eyebrows were furrowed and he looked very unhappy. The old servant immediately retreated. Before a minute had passed, a gunshot was suddenly heard from inside the room. The old servant, knowing that something was wrong, pushed the door open and saw Mr. Li lying in a pool of blood, a pistol about two steps away from him. The bullet entered from his right temple, and his brains and blood flowed straight out. Knowing that it was suicide, he rushed to inform the security guard of the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<h3>Purchasing a Large Number of Maritime Vessels from the U.S. Government</h3>
<p>Planning to Purchase Fifteen Ships First, Drawings of Each Ship Have Been Obtained</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau has requested the central government to allocate a fund of 15 million yuan to reorganize its debts and develop its shipping business. The Bureau has submitted the entire plan for shipbuilding and dock construction to the Ministry of Transportation. According to information recently obtained by the reporter, the Bureau is purchasing a large number of maritime vessels from the U.S. Department of Transportation and is currently in negotiations. This matter is of great importance, and the details are investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ship Addition Plan Formulated to Add New Ships and Supplement Various Routes, in addition to the four maritime vessels built with British Boxer Indemnity loans, totaling 6 million yuan, the ships currently in use on various routes are too old and consume too much coal, and it is urgent to decommission them. The minimum number of new ships to be added should be twenty-three, including eight maritime vessels that can be purchased from foreign countries. There are also fifteen vessels that must be built to order. Among them, ten ships are planned to be used in the Yangtze River, and the rest will be used on various coastal routes. The estimated cost of construction</p>
<p>And purchase costs are approximately 7.8 million yuan. In this way, all shipping lines can be fully productive.</p>
<p>Discussing the Purchase of American Vessels: During the European War, the U.S. government built a large number of maritime vessels for transportation. The U.S. Government Shipping Bureau has recently sold larger steamships to various domestic shipping merchants. The U.S. government has transferred the remaining ships to the management of the Department of Transportation. Due to the depression in world shipping, the U.S. feels that it has too much tonnage. Small-tonnage vessels are difficult to allocate. It is learned that the China Merchants Bureau is planning to borrow money to build ships and expand its shipping business. The U.S. Department of Transportation ShippingBoard is willing to sell some of its maritime vessels to China. It has telegraphed its office in Shanghai, instructing it to contact the Chinese Ministry of Transportation and the China Merchants Bureau to handle the sale procedures.</p>
<p>Payment Methods: The Department of Transportation wants to sell a total of one hundred and several dozen ships, with different load capacities. Some are suitable for the overseas routes, and others are suitable for the inland sea routes. The U.S. government stated that if China agrees to purchase them, if the full payment cannot be made at once, it may refer to the cotton and wheat loan methods previously agreed upon between China and the U.S. and sign a ship purchase loan agreement to pay the ship price in installments. If this is done, the China Merchants Bureau can use the ships purchased to start production and repay the installments batch by batch, which is easy.</p>
<p>Approved Purchase: This method has been discussed by the China Merchants Bureau many times and is considered beneficial to the Bureau's operational needs and economic strength. The Ministry of Transportation also expressed great sympathy for this, so the Bureau has repeatedly reviewed and considered the full range of maritime vessels offered by the U.S. Department of Transportation and has decided to designate fifteen vessels that meet the draft load requirements for navigating along China's coastal ports. The Bureau has informed the U.S. Department of Transportation's office in Shanghai the other day to quickly send the drawings of the fifteen vessels to the Bureau for review and negotiation of the purchase contract.</p>
<p>Reported to the Ministry of Transportation: The China Merchants Bureau's Shipping Department believes that there is a suitable opportunity to purchase vessels, so it</p>
<p>Submitted a report to the Ministry of Transportation on the ninth of this month, after signing its opinions on the reasons for purchasing the American vessels and the selection of the fifteen vessels. As for the plan to build new ships in the Yangtze River, it will proceed as soon as the allocated funds are received.</p>

<p>The Chinese constables reported to the police station, and the police chief immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. As he was British, the British Consulate was notified to remove the body, and the pistol was kept on file. As for the cause of his suicide, according to his friends, he had received a telegram from his home in England three weeks ago, saying that his mother had died. Since then, he had been depressed. Recently, he accidentally injured someone near the French General Assembly while driving his car, and was summoned by the Police Court of the British Consulate. Therefore, he had been even more uneasy in recent days. Yesterday morning was the date for the court hearing, but he did not comply with the summons. At the same time, the tragedy occurred. It is expected that his suicide was entirely due to great psychological stimuli.</p>
<p>Municipal Authorities</p>
<h3>Strictly Investigating Horse Races</h3>
<p>Regarding the drag racing in Yinxiang Township, because the International Horse Racing Club had not submitted a request to the authorities for approval and the organization and actions were close to gambling, the municipal government rejected the request for approval. Later, the Chinese Jockey Club followed the usual procedures and requested the municipal government to hold a competition on the afternoon of the tenth of this month. The municipal government allowed it as a routine activity. Unexpectedly, the club still used the trotters newly purchased from Australia by the International Horse Racing Club to hold the competition without notifying the authorities beforehand. The municipal government believes that this is very wrong and will severely punish it.</p>

The court, considering that the student was avenging his father, sentenced him to seven years in prison and abandoned the appeal. Now it is learned that Qian Shaofeng's defense lawyer, Qian Shusheng, has reviewed the case files and believes that it meets the requirements of the amnesty regulations. He has submitted a suggestion to the Shanghai Lawyers Association to forward it to the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, requesting an amnesty for Qian Shaofeng's release from prison. The Executive Yuan has now approved and instructed the Shanghai Lawyers Association to order the association to request directly to the Judicial Yuan. After receiving the Executive Yuan's approval, the Shanghai Lawyers Association decided to draft another petition and copies of the entire case file and request the Judicial Yuan to consider that the student avenged his father and filial piety is commendable, and to forward it to the National Government for an order of amnesty.</p>

<p>Zhabei Area</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens are Rampant</h3>
<p>Two Opium Dens Busted in One Day</p>
<p>Flower Club Factory Has Many Earpieces</p>
<p>Recently, the Zhabei area of ​​this city has been cracked down on drug trafficking opium dens and other places by the police agencies, with several cases occurring every day.

<p>Liu Xiang's Old Unit</p>
<h3>Victim of Fraudulent Investment Saved from Suicide</h3>
<p>Rescued by a Boatman and Granted a New Life</p>
<p>Sent to the Public Safety Bureau and Provided with Funds to Return to His Hometown</p>
<p>Zhang Bingliang, aged 21, a native of Nanjiang County, Sichuan Province, was formerly a platoon leader in the 21st Army under Liu Xiang in Sichuan. He was injured in the leg by bandits during the suppression of communists at Baikemen and retired from the military for medical treatment, which has since been completed. A few days ago, Zhang, carrying over 300 yuan in cash and a suitcase, traveled by ship to Shanghai with a friend surnamed Liu, intending to seek work through relatives and friends. However, when the ship stopped at Xiaguan, Liu, harboring malicious intentions, seized the opportunity while Zhang was sound asleep and stole all of Zhang's belongings, including the suitcase (containing cash), and fled ashore, disappearing without a trace. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, Zhang was left penniless and without accommodation. He searched extensively for relatives and friends for work but was unsuccessful. On the afternoon of the Double Tenth Festival at 6 p.m., he secretly went to the outer bund of the New Wharf in Nanshi and, unseen, jumped into the river, attempting suicide. Fortunately, Zhou Qingyi, a boatman parked there, noticed him and quickly devised a way to rescue him, thus saving him from death. He then handed Zhang over to the local Municipal Public Safety Bureau Water Patrol Team for assistance. After questioning by the Water Patrol Team Captain Zhu Haishan, the situation was deemed pitiable. Captain Zhu immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Relief Section of the General Bureau for assistance. It is now known that at around 10 a.m. yesterday, Chief Hong dispatched Yin Guanzhi, the director of the Relief Section, to investigate the case. Zhang Bingliang testified to the same situation as before and a letter addressed to Du Yuesheng seeking assistance was found. The letter described the experience of being deceived on the ship to Shanghai and a request for relief. After verifying the statement, Chief Hong instructed that travel expenses be issued. Yesterday afternoon, a letter was sent to the Hankou Municipal Public Safety Bureau to forward them to Sichuan, Zhang's hometown.</p>

<p>After the Collapse of Wu Hua Bank</p>
<h3>To be Reorganized by the Head Office</h3>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Shijie Discusses the Bank's Legal Issues</p>
<p>And the Baxianqiao branch, which had not been in business for long, suddenly collapsed on August 21st of this year, causing a great stir among depositors. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, the bank appointed accountant Wang Sifang, lawyer Jiang Yiping, and others as representatives to declare liquidation. Later, the Hong Kong head office entrusted Huang Linsheng, Yang Yigong, and Xu Yuangao as authorized representatives to preside over the liquidation of the Shanghai branch and authorized lawyer Luo Jiaheng, accountant Li Cheng, and others to represent the head office in liquidating the Shanghai branch. On the one hand, it published a statement denying the liquidation commissioned by the managers of the branch, and on the other hand, ordered the branch to hand over the account books for verification. The managers of the branch, Fan Shaoliang, Ye Haitian, and others, also published a statement opposing the head office's management of the liquidation on behalf of the branch, and demanding that the head office return the more than 210,000 yuan of equity that had previously been withdrawn and deposit it in the Central Bank to repay debts. The representatives of the head office insisted on their original claims, leading to a lack of coordination between the two parties. To date, there is still no concrete solution. Meanwhile, some creditors, such as Chu Longgen and Luo Lihua, have already appointed lawyers Zhang Shijie, Lou Yunmei, Xu Jie, Mao Fengwu, and others to file a criminal lawsuit against the bank with the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court for crimes such as breach of trust and fraud. The case has already been heard once. A reporter from Guowen News Agency specifically visited lawyer Zhang Shijie yesterday to inquire about the legal responsibilities and latest news following the collapse of the branch bank. According to him, the criminal aspect of the case has already been pursued by depositors Chu Longgen and others in accordance with the law. As the case is in litigation, he cannot express any opinions. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the bank's failure to register with the government is already illegal, and the collapse this time is difficult to avoid fraudulent circumstances. It has ordered the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to handle the case in accordance with the law, and it is heard that it is currently under thorough investigation. Regarding the civil aspect, it can be roughly said that the establishment of Wu Hua Bank's head office and Shanghai branch was neither approved by the Ministry of Finance for registration nor registered with the Ministry of Industry. It has never obtained legal person status and therefore cannot apply the Company Law. Therefore, the Shanghai branch's declaration of liquidation is legally unfounded. Since the head office is now safely in existence, it should promptly assume responsibility and jointly settle debts with the Shanghai branch. It is heard that lawyer Luo Jiaheng and others intend to proceed according to the provisions of the Civil Law on partnership.</p>

<h3>On-Site Investigation of Morphine Manufacturing Site</h3>
<p>The Scale Far Exceeds That of Japanese Drug-Making Organizations</p>
<p>Principal Culprit Couple Flees; Nothing Found in Residence</p>
<p>Cai Bicheng, residing at No. 34 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road, had privately set up a morphine manufacturing facility in the giant building at Nos. 175-176-177 Avenue Edward VII. On the morning of the Double Tenth Festival, a worker extracting morphine was careless, causing a fire. Cai, who was at home, heard the alarm and immediately drove away in his car. The staff and workers in the facility also fled in succession. Three individuals, including Gong Baochang, were apprehended by detectives and sent to the First Special District Local Court for detention and further investigation, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Cai Bicheng is from Sichuan and previously served as a magistrate in a county in Sichuan. He amassed wealth by exploiting the people, and was dismissed by his superiors for excessive corruption. Cai then came to Shanghai with his assets. His wife, Ms. Gan, is from Hunan and they were married just last year. They moved to Qinyuan Village, Xinzha, this spring in March. The house where the morphine was manufactured is owned by the Dayao Construction Company on Museum Road. A man named Wang Jiepu leased the house from Dayao for a monthly rent of 300 silver taels. The house is entirely constructed of cement and steel and is four stories high. It was recently completed. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m., Liu Yugui, the judge presiding over the case in the First Special Court, accompanied by Secretary Yin and lawyer Zhang Tianyin from the Public Concession Police, went to the facility under the guidance of Tang Jian and Potter, the Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the Xinzha Police Station, and Detective Lu Gendi.</p>
<p>A detailed inspection revealed that the walls on the lowest floor of the building were painted green and the glass windows had "wet paint" signs, indicating that it had just been renovated. A sign for the Xinghua Woolen Company was hung at the entrance. The second floor was piled with numerous boxes, containing wool and soda ash. There were also several bundles of woolen fabric on the floor. However, there were many empty wooden boxes. The third floor contained two large machines. In addition, there were empty kerosene tins and wooden boxes, some of which contained what appeared to be</p>
<p>Sand and mud, while others were completely empty. The fourth floor had a wide variety of equipment, including two smaller machines and sixteen large earthenware vats, all filled with water. The water surface was clean, but the bottom of the vats contained substances such as [ether], [kerosene], and [coffee]. There were also more than twenty coal stoves arranged in a corner. Next to the staircase was a small secret room, containing wool and drying equipment. It is said that this room was specifically used for drying wool. The case has been submitted to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court for approval. However, the head office was registered with the Hong Kong government and is a foreign legal entity, but it has not been recognized by the Chinese government. According to Article 15 of the Implementation Law of the General Principles of Civil Law, a foreign legal entity that has not been recognized cannot engage in legal acts with others in its own name. The actor shall be jointly and severally liable with the foreign legal entity for the legal act. Therefore, the deputy managers and important positions of the Shanghai branch should be jointly and severally responsible with the head office for settling debts. According to a reporter's investigation, the head office of Wu Hua Bank is located on Wing Lok Street, Hong Kong. The chairman is Liang Tingyi and the general manager is Huang Huimin. There are four branches: (1) Yide Road, Guangzhou; (2) Yongfu Road, Xinchan; (3) West Gate Road, Taishan; (4) No. 130 Ningbo Road, Shanghai. The Shanghai branch officially opened on October 12, 1933.

At the sound of the third bell, Judge Sun Honglin, accompanied by Judges Zhang Chaozuo and Fan Peien, and Secretary Huang Lixiang, together with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, specifically opened the Criminal Court No. 1. Judge Sun, acting as the presiding judge, convened a collegial panel for trial. He immediately ordered the summon of the appellant Zhang Zuming, who was absent due to illness. The others, such as Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, were summoned to the court. The court first questioned each person about their age, origin, address, and occupation. Then, the judge stated that after reviewing the medical prescription submitted by Zhang Zuming, the illness was not very serious. He should have come to court to answer questions despite his illness. The defense lawyer Lin Yingqing immediately stated that Zhang Zuming was suffering from hemoptysis and fever, and could not be exposed to the wind according to the doctor's instructions, so he could not come to court. He had previously filed a request for postponement, etc. Subsequently, the lawyer from the Police Department stated the reasons for the appeal, roughly stating that the defendants in this case were arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution after June 17. The court sentenced the four defendants to be innocent. The Police Department disagrees with the verdict of the first instance in terms of the evidence collected.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Rewarded for Capturing Thief</h3>

They were warmly received, and Dr. Mei agreed to perform on stage to help the disaster victims in Hubei Province. It is reported that the association members are extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Yixing Natives</p>
<h3>Fundraising in Shanghai to Aid Fellow Villagers</h3>
<p>Yixing is a place of abundant products and fertile land, traditionally known as a wealthy region. However, this year's drought has made the autumn harvest hopeless, and over ten million disaster-stricken villagers are crying out in the four rural areas. Their sorrowful voices fill the fields, and their plight urgently requires relief. Yixing natives in Shanghai, including Wu Kaisheng, Pan Xulun, and Sha Biaokai, believe that this matter concerns their hometown and that they should urgently work together to provide relief. They immediately organized the Yixing Drought Relief Committee, soliciting donations from various sectors. On the afternoon of the 11th, they hosted a banquet at the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, inviting fellow villagers in Shanghai to discuss concrete relief plans. Sha Yankai was elected as the chairman, Wu Kaisheng and Pan Xulun as vice-chairmen, Wu Fukang and Xu Baohe as secretaries, Wu Junyan as general affairs officer, Zong Boxuan as treasurer, and Xiao Yiping as publicist. The fundraising team is divided into ten groups, meeting every two weeks to report on the fundraising situation.

<p>Li Xibiao Died on the Road in Shanghai</p>
<h3>His Family Claimed the Remaining Money</h3>

Detective Huang Yufu and Zhao Jianchun of the Yulin Road Police Station investigated, removed the body to the coroner's office for examination, and ordered its entombment. The deceased man was found to have a large sum of money on his person, including a draft from the Royal Bank of Canada dated May 23, 1934, for 1,500 Hong Kong dollars, another draft from the same bank dated May 31, 1934, for 720 Hong Kong dollars, and a third draft of the same type for 100 Hong Kong dollars, as well as four Canadian dollars, one US dollar, and a small photograph. Investigation revealed that the man's real name was Li Xibiao, a businessman who traded abroad, and that his family lived in Hong Kong. The police then commissioned the Hong Kong police authorities to investigate his family. It was later found that his wife, Li Lu, and brother, Li Hui, both lived in Hong Kong. They were instructed to come to Shanghai to claim the estate. Li Lu and Li Hui have now arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Wang Yaotang applied to the Procuratorate of the Special Court No. 1 to allow the deceased's belongings to be handed over to his family, and the Procuratorate instructed that they be claimed from the police.</p>

<h3>The Flourishing of Enterprise Deposits at Wing On Banking Corporation</h3>
<p>The enterprise deposits recently created by Wing On Banking Corporation are truly a form of high-interest deposit with good method and a beautiful intention, and with simple procedures. The so-called enterprise refers to a pre-determined plan, with a corresponding fund deposited into the company. Over a certain period, the abundant principal and interest obtained will enable the achievement of the enterprise. This type of deposit has been popular in Europe and America for a long time and is extremely suitable for modern society in China, and is suitable for old age, marriage, education, relief, and gifts. It is said that for ordinary bank savings, to obtain one thousand yuan in five years, at least six hundred and twenty yuan must be deposited as principal. Now the company's fixed principal is only five hundred and ninety-nine yuan and fifty cents, with excellent interest rates, benefiting depositors, and is unrivaled by others. Therefore, customers who understand interest calculations have been flocking to the company to make deposits every day, all feeling that this is a rare opportunity and fearing that the quota will be filled.</p>

<h3>Daxin National Silk and Satin Bureau Implements a New Plan</h3>
<p>Initial Business Statistics for Special Sales of National Silk and Satin</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yansong, a leader in the silk industry, in order to implement his principle of patriotism through the use of local products, reorganized the original site of Daxin at the intersection of the Third Road and Shilu into the Daxin National Silk and Satin Bureau on October 1, specializing in the sale of domestic silk and satin. In order to save silk and strive for domestic silk and satin and make planned responses to foreign goods, he established a design office in the bureau in advance to promote a new plan to respond to the war. Regarding the Japanese goods exhibition recently planned by the Japanese in Shanghai, it is a powerful countermeasure. According to the design office of the bureau, commercial warfare does not take the market as the end point of competition, but the end point of commercial warfare is the hearts of people with purchasing power. If all industries can be organized in a planned way to compete for the hearts of people with purchasing power in the domestic market, they can be sure of victory. Therefore, the new plan currently being promoted by the bureau is to pay close attention to this. It is heard that since the opening of the bureau, thanks to the support of various circles for the psychology of protecting domestic silk and satin, its ten-day business record shows that the business statistics are more than double those during the period when foreign goods were sold, and the colors and patterns of various new silk and satin are especially welcome. It can also prove that the progress of the domestic silk and satin craftsmanship is sufficient to compete with foreign goods.</p>

<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>Kunming Soy Sauce Establishes a New Distribution Office. The Kunming Brewery at No. 1062 Huasheng Road in this city produces soy sauce meticulously using scientific methods. Its cleanliness and hygiene are, of course, unquestionable, and its delicious seasoning and affordable price are well-known. Therefore, since its opening, domestic orders from places such as Pingjin, Wuhan, and foreign orders from places such as the Nanyang Islands have been shipped by bottle, and business is booming. Recently, the local area has been sold by other companies, which inevitably leads to adulteration and price increases, and users still do not benefit. For this reason, the first distribution office has been specially opened at No. 193 Wenjianshi Road, and officially opened on Double Ten Day. Its products are divided into five types, including standard, best sun-dried oil, Fu oil, and double set, all of which are very convenient and affordable, and delivery and preferential measures are ordered. Letters of inquiry are sent immediately.</p>

Those who want to order should do so as soon as possible to enjoy the benefits of health. Guanghua Holds an Eyeglass Exhibition.

<p>Tales of the Capital</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Feeling Pity at the Door for the Unsolved Plight of the Young Girl, Visiting a Poor Family to Hear of Hardships and Cherish Jade.</p>
<p>However, he was very generous and not afraid of being spied on by others. He still leaned close to the waiter and muttered. Li Shilian saw this situation and understood a bit in his heart. Another waiter saw him coming in, opened the door for him, and brought in lamps, tea, and water. Li Shilian stretched his head out to look outside, but the person was gone. He whispered, "The person who was talking to your companion outside just now, is he a traveler?" The waiter whispered with a smile, "No, does Mr. Li want to see him? We can call him in to take a look." Li Shilian said, "Are there people like that here too? Where is he from?" The waiter said, "There is an opera troupe from Kaiyuan Temple here, and they are all southerners. They are just doing business with outsiders. The man just now is not from Kaiyuan Temple, but because his family is poor, he came out to find some pocket money. He is not a local. His ancestors were officials in Shaanxi, but they became poor and didn't return to their hometown, and there is nothing he can do." As he said that, he smiled faintly under the lamp. Then he said, "Shall I call him in to take a look?" Li Shilian waved his hands repeatedly and said, "No, no. He is a descendant of an official, and we are also officials. We protect each other, so let's forget about it." As he shouted this, he had already alarmed Zhang Jiefu, who lived next door. He asked, "Mr. Li, Mr. Li, what's going on with officials protecting each other?" He thought that Mr. Li didn't like this, but Mr. Zhang might like it. Li Shilian threw aside the words he had just said and laughed, "I accidentally met a friend here. He is in the banking industry, and if a branch is set up in Xi'an in the future, he will be the manager of the branch here. He has been a friend of mine for many years, and our friendship is not bad. If I get a job in the tax bureau here, I will need his help." Zhang Jiefu said, "Are you saying that you will protect each other?" (83)</p>
<h3>Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai</h3>
<p>— Held by Buddha</p>
<p>In the past, women's psychology did not include the concept of "divorce." "Growing old together" was the only wish. Is there a good way to achieve the wish of "growing old together"? Yes; the people of Ningbo have long had one.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen new dramas knows the play "Zhu Yingtai and Liang Shanbo." In Ningbo, on summer nights, there are blind storytellers who sing along the streets, also singing the tragic and beautiful love story of Zhu and Liang, which is very popular. On the eighth day of the eighth lunar month, said to be Liang Shanbo's birthday, men and women, old and young, foolish and pretty, urban and rural, travel by boat or car in groups to burn incense at the Liang Shanbo Temple by the river. There is a saying among the people of Ningbo; "If you want a husband and wife to grow old together, visit Liang Shanbo Temple!" Isn't this the secret that the people of Ningbo have long discovered for "husband and wife growing old together"?</p>
<p>So, Ningbo women will never be widows? That's not necessarily the case. However, even widows have a need to go to Liang Shanbo Temple to burn incense. The reason for being a widow in this life may be because they didn't burn incense in the previous life; if they don't want to be widows in the next life, how can they not burn incense in this life? With this reasoning, the incense at Liang Shanbo Temple will naturally flourish without decline. It is said that on Little Lingfeng Mountain in Ningbo, there is a small Ge Xianweng Hall, and there is also a saying; "If someone prays to me for birth, offer a thousand taels of silver!" Ge Xianweng understands people's greed for wealth, so on the tenth day of the fourth lunar month, his birthday, people are shoulder-to-shoulder to celebrate his birthday and buy paper slips; these tattered paper slips are worth a thousand taels of silver. The prosperous business of monks and Taoists is all based on these tricks.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Prefectural Chronicle says; "Liang Shanbo, styled Churen, from Kuaiji, went out to study and met Zhu Yingtai from Shangyu, who disguised herself as a man; she studied with Liang for three years, like good friends. Later, Zhu returned first; two years later, Liang returned to Shangyu to visit and only then did he know that she was a woman, and he returned in disappointment. He told his parents and asked for marriage, but Zhu had already been promised to the Ma family of Mao City. The matter was thus dropped. Not long after, Liang died and was buried on Qingdao Yuan, west of Mao City. The following year, Zhu married into the Ma family, passed Liang's tomb, and the wind and lightning prevented her from proceeding. Zhu knew it was Liang's tomb, so she approached the tomb and mourned bitterly, moving passersby; the tomb suddenly opened, and she entered with her body. The matter was reported to the court, and Prime Minister Xie An requested that it be sealed, and named it 'Tomb of the Righteous Woman.'" Another account says that Liang Shanbo was once the magistrate of Yin County and was a native of Kuaiji in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Although this event has some mythological elements, there are probably some mysteries within it; however, the story is fragrant and beautiful, enough to provide material for later generations to talk about.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shou Ruo)</p>
<p>Spring is the season for a stirring heart; summer is the season for an enthusiastic heart; autumn is the season for a cooling heart; winter is the season for a cold heart; this is the fixed pattern of the rotation of heaven's heart.</p>
<p>Isn't the rotation of the human heart generally the same? Therefore, the changeability of the human heart seems ordinary and not surprising.</p>
<h3>Record of Drifting Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager spent about half an hour touring the city, going through all the major streets; unfortunately, I never asked her what her impressions were, otherwise, it would have been very useful to compare it with my own feelings. After leaving the city, she did not give everyone time to rest and immediately ordered them to carry her to a small hill on the edge of the city. Although the height of this small hill is very low, if people reach the top of it, they can see the scenery of the surrounding area! Especially that ancient Great Wall, it can be seen more clearly! I was quietly enjoying the pleasure of climbing high and looking out when I suddenly heard the Empress Dowager instruct Li Lianying to send someone to prepare palanquins for us, and I knew that this good opportunity would definitely not be lost again. Climbing mountains and looking at fields is such a fun thing! People originally have nothing they don't enjoy; I think the other female officials must have been very happy at that time. As for our palanquins, there was absolutely no problem; although we didn't bring the ones we usually ride in, in the former Qing Dynasty, palanquins were the only means of transportation in various places, and it was very easy to find a dozen of them; moreover, when Qing Shan and others notified the local officials to prepare to receive the imperial visit, they had also instructed them to prepare a few official palanquins for us to use in advance.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the top of the mountain, the Empress Dowager smiled triumphantly as she looked at the winding Great Wall. "In the beginning, this Great Wall was built to isolate us outside!" she said excitedly; "However, now, we have already stood inside! And we are standing here looking at it. I think this is something no one ever thought of! In fact, what difference is there between us and mainland China? We are also part of China; the language and customs are mostly the same, but the people in the mainland insist on seeing us as separate, that is truly short-sighted! Since we came to power, we have become even more integrated; the old boundaries can be said to have been swept away, only this dilapidated great project remains incomplete." (148)</p>
<h3>Open-Air Market</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Most people who have taken the Route 6 tram from the 16th Pier to the French Concession in Lujiawan know that past the Ximen Xieqiao, where it borders the Chinese area, there is a long strip of vacant land; it was rumored to be a stagnant river that was filled in a few years ago; across from that strip of land, there is a market, with many shops, but it's not considered economical, and the prices are about the same as other commercial stores; to the left of the strip of land are mostly small, dirty民房!茅屋草棚 (civilian housing! thatched huts and shacks) are the decorations in between. From our imagination, we know that the place is undoubtedly a mixture of laborers and coolies; there is an open-air market on the strip of land, but it is different from ordinary second-hand stalls. In their market, everything is clearly divided, and each type of small business is separated by a cloth wall as its place of business, with a cloth on top to shield from the sun's steaming heat and the attack of light rain, but if it encounters heavy rain and strong winds, transactions must be stopped. They are arranged like scales, with the width of two mu of land; the market has a barbershop, with a dressing mirror hanging up, and a sofa chair set in place, the barber is also in pure white uniform, their skills are bound to be above the apprentices on the streets and alleys with a washbasin and stool, and lower than the barbers of Xiao Hanji's Yileye; fried dough sticks and sesame cakes are the central business inside, those buried in munching are almost shoulder-to-shoulder; the rest, such as porridge shops, soybean milk stalls, and small glutinous rice ball vendors, are the pillars of the open-air market; in their market, apart from the barbershop, it seems to be leaning towards eating. Xieqiao also has a famous base camp (second-hand stalls), just like this small food market, beautiful on the north and south sides, complementing each other; on that side, there are also peep shows, monkey shows, selling fists,... It is truly a miniature amusement park, probably the entertainment for the laborers and coolies after work?</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Good News for Reviving Agriculture and Industry</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper of October 3rd of the 23rd year, there are three kinds of very good news, one is that the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province borrowed 3 million yuan from the banking sector of Shanghai to control the purchase of autumn cocoons, which started on the 20th of last month. Up to now, 14,500 dan of fresh cocoons have been collected, which can be reeled into 450 jin to 60 jin of silk. It is expected that more than 20,000 dan can be collected continuously, and it has been decided to merge the silk reeling committee into the cocoon purchasing committee to be responsible for handling silk reeling matters. Another is that the National Economic Commission has achieved good results since controlling the cotton industry. This year, many places have had a bumper harvest of cotton, especially the Northwest, which is most suitable for planting cotton. In the future, in addition to supplying the domestic textile industry, it can also be exported to Japan. Another is that India needs our country's products and has sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau to introduce the following products: (A) grass mats, fans, and firecrackers, (B) fennel oil, cassia bark oil, etc. Therefore, I have a hundred thousand points of hope that rescuing rural areas and promoting production industries, following this track, will enable everyone to do their best and make the most of the land, and within a few years, they will definitely be able to advance to the realm of wealth and strength, which can be asserted. In ancient times, setting up markets was originally the business of the authorities, so that there would be no disadvantages of monopoly and control. Last year, I saw that cocoon merchants in a certain county would lower the price of cocoon purchases for those who did not join the trade, considering it an act of great rebellion, and the government actually prohibited them from lowering the price, and I secretly thought that it was very incomprehensible. At this time of rural bankruptcy, they are trying to absorb them at high prices, so as to encourage them without delay, but they are prohibiting purchasers from lowering the price, making silkworm farmers in a helpless situation, which is really going against the grain. Now, our Zhejiang Province has this good deed, and it is expected that next year, the number of silkworm farmers will definitely increase, and the improvement of silkworm varieties can also be seen in fact. Those who have been planning to cut down mulberry trees and change their business may even urgently seek to add planting, and the joyous and prosperous state should be seen again next year. Foreign trade, silk and tea are originally the main commodities, and if they can be operated by the government, they will naturally have the power to control them. Even if they do not profit, it will not hurt. As far as the rural economy is concerned, a family of eight only seeks to be warm and full, but as long as the crops are harvested, the income is enough to cover the expenses, that is, there is no excessive desire. If the silkworm farming business does not have the risk of loss, then everyone will do their best and the output will definitely double. When the output doubles, the cost of labor and materials does not necessarily need to double, and even its selling price will naturally tend to be flat, which is a matter of course. It is possible that in three or five years, the price of silk will be equal to that of rayon. Even if it is not possible, it is possible for the government to raise the tax on rayon, so that it is equal to the market price of silk, but if the domestic silk sales are not taken away by rayon, there will be no risk of oversupply. Therefore, I believe that Zhejiang Province has this good method, and other provinces can imitate it, so that there is a possibility of a whole adjustment in agriculture and industry. As far as rice and grain are concerned, at this time when the new grain is about to be harvested, it can also be absorbed by the treasury, so as to avoid being suppressed by the market monks. In the past, when new grain was put on the market, the price of rice must fall, not because the supply exceeded the demand, but because the farmers were eager to exchange money, so they were monopolized by cheap husbands. If the government buys it, it is also okay to increase a few percent on the current market price. Considering the past years, when new rice is put on the market, compared with the time when the green and yellow are not connected in the next year, the value often differs by as much as 30% or more. The profit calculation of market monks is ten times more than that of banks, for example, a one-cent profit is based on a full year in the bank, while in the market monk's aspect, one-cent is required in a turn-around. Therefore, those who are good at dancing with long sleeves and specialize in hoarding often make a fortune, and the proverb calls them rice weevils, which means that they are not afraid of loss, but only afraid of weevils eating their hoarded rice. If the government collects and stores it, but uses A to prevent weevils, there is nothing to be afraid of. If you are worried about foreign rice invading sales, you can also use tariffs as a barrier. As long as farmers can eat and be warm, and there is no worry about hunger and cold, it is enough to make the hearts of the people of the whole country gradually return to stability. As for the group of people who do not till and eat, and do not weave and wear clothes, even if they offer twice the price of today, it is okay. They will be forced to find their own way and turn to farming and weaving to seek a living. Therefore, I believe that the strategy of peace is that as long as the matter of exchanging what you have for what you don't have can be governed by the authorities, all obstacles can be avoided, and the revival of agriculture and industry is in it? The items needed by India are just a drop in the bucket. Where there is profit, people will go. But if international trade can be handled by the government, on the one hand, it will suspend prices to absorb, and on the other hand, it will use state-owned transportation, not focusing on the profit or loss of one item. As long as the import surplus becomes an export surplus, the goal of hiding wealth among the people can be achieved. If each industrial and commercial company is allowed to plot foreign trade, I expect all kinds of difficulties and concerns everywhere, which will not help. I sincerely hope that our government and financiers will act quickly.</p>

<p>Elite Players of the Donghua Football Team</p>
<h3>Wan Xianghua Joins the Liaoning Team</h3>
<p>The Liaoning football team has a good chance of winning this year's championship based on their strength. There has been a change to the left wing of the team. The original left winger, Liu Fuyuan, did not arrive, and he has been replaced by Wan Xianghua, the famous left winger of the Shanghai Donghua football team. Wan has played for Donghua for many years, and his reputation as the "dwarf tiger" is well known throughout the country. His addition to the Liaoning team is like adding wings to a tiger.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>Ms. Tang, a reporter from a certain news agency, wore a long, water-green dress with pleated hem today (the 11th), and her fingernails were painted with red nail polish. The female reporter followed her husband to the battlefield, sitting in the press box and filling out records.</p>
<p>The athletes from Hebei agreed to support each other.</p>
<p>The "Camellia Lady" Dong Shijin visited Wang Jingxi by car.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiwu wore his old Boy Scout uniform and stood in the middle of the field to guide the Boy Scout service. He was truly energetic and could be called an "old Boy Scout."</p>
<p>When Beiping played softball against Hebei, the Hebei cheerleading team accidentally knocked down Ms. Zheng Lihua, a softball player from Beiping. The entire softball team scolded them, but the language was elegant.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun, the sprint athlete, participated in the conference as the general manager of the Liaoning team. His long-standing reputation as a "sprinter" was hidden, and he did not show his skills. Those who hoped to see Mr. Liu's performance would inevitably feel that "fate is not granted." However, Mr. Liu's actions were noticed, no less than those of the new nobles running on the battlefield. Mr. Liu himself seemed to be trying to be a refined scholar, carrying a large leather bag, and had the air of a professor. Whenever reporters asked questions, he would repeatedly say "I can't take it, I can't take it."</p>
<p>Situ Guang, a veteran track and field athlete, was also a renowned triple jumper. He also retired from this grand event. The reporter found this 1</p>
<p>retired general in the field, carrying a camera case on his back and holding a camera in his hand, running all over the field, seemingly having changed careers. After inquiring, it was learned that Situ Guang came to the conference this time as a photography reporter for the Shanghai Liangyou Company.</p>
<p>Wang Jingxi, the middle hurdle athlete, returned from the Far East and automatically gave up the middle hurdle, switching to soccer. He participated in the conference this time as a soccer player, meeting the athletes from Huaibei. The reporter met Mr. Wang at the conference today (the 11th), and he and his girlfriend, Dong Shijin, were walking together. Mr. Wang looked cheerful and smiled before speaking.</p>

<h3>Assisting Poor Students from Huzhou to Advance in Their Studies</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Office of the Huzhou Association, established in October of the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], has now reached its sixth year. The successive executive committees have spared no effort in promoting the association's affairs, and have been particularly effective in handling public welfare for fellow townsmen. It has now been learned that when the office held its general meeting of members this spring, it resolved on a proposal to [financially assist poor students from Huzhou in furthering their education], which was entrusted to the executive committee for implementation. The executive committee has now specially established a review committee to assist poor students in their studies. All students from the six counties of Huzhou who are of excellent character and academic standing, and who, after graduating from junior high school, are truly unable to continue their education due to family poverty, but who aspire to further studies, will be subsidized by the office with 100 yuan per year. The quota is set at six students, but they must be designated to enroll in the Provincial Vocational School of Technology and Agriculture, which is run on behalf of the province by the National Chekiang University. The regulations stipulate that a summary can be read at the office (No. 4, Shai Chang, Si Qiao, Nanjing).</p>
<p>It is reported that this semester, two students, Wang Shaozhen from Changxing County and Zhang Zongjiang from Wuxing County, have already been approved by the office and have enrolled in the Provincial Vocational School of Technology and Agriculture, run on behalf of the province by National Chekiang University.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>A Method for Rectifying and Boosting Voltage Directly from High-Voltage Power Lines</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>Currently, when we make small radios, we often adopt the method of rectification directly from power lines because power transformers are heavy and difficult to wind for high voltage. This method is already as convenient as possible. However, it is limited by the high-voltage side (the power line voltage is only up to 220 volts), which prevents vacuum tubes from working to their full potential. For example, the plate voltage of a 58 tube needs to be 250 volts for maximum efficiency; otherwise, it will not work well. Recently, although rectifier tubes such as the 2525 have been introduced, which can be used for voltage doubling with appropriate circuits without the need for a power transformer, this type of tube is only suitable for American standards, i.e., it can only be used when the voltage is only a hundred and several tens of volts. If it is too high, it cannot handle it. At this time, it is necessary to connect a resistor in series to reduce the voltage to a considerable level. We already know that whenever current passes through a resistor, there will be a consumption of I²×R. When 2525 is used on a 220-volt power line, one tube consumes the power of two tubes, and the voltage obtained is still around 220 volts, which makes it unsuitable.</p>
<p>Now, please allow me to describe the voltage-doubling rectification method using ordinary vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>You can connect two vacuum tubes, such as 71 or other rectifier tubes, as shown in the diagram. What is needed for this method is a rewound doorbell transformer or a self-wound low-voltage transformer to supply the filament current to the two tubes separately. The plate of V1 is connected to the center tap of the V2 filament power supply, and then connected to one end of the high voltage. The plate of V2 is the negative pole of the DC output. The other end of the high voltage is connected to the junction of two large capacitors connected in series. The ripple is about the same as ordinary, which can be clearly seen from the diagram. If the incoming line is 220 volts, the theoretical output after rectification is 440 volts; however, the output is slightly lower than 440 volts because there is resistance in the rectifier tube, choke coil, and capacitor. The vacuum tubes in this method are used in series, so the output current is not doubled. If it is necessary to double the current while doubling the voltage, then each tube can be connected in parallel with another vacuum tube, for a total of four. The price of vacuum tubes is very low now. The value of four is not much, and after being connected in parallel, the efficiency can be improved a lot.</p>
<h3>New Type of Copper Oxide Pickup</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The job of a pickup is to convert the changes in sound waves on a record into changes in electrical waves, so it is also called a record reproducer. Most of the commonly used pickups now are of the magnetic type. This type of pickup has very little output electrical energy (usually about half a volt). When using it, it is often necessary to add two stages of low-frequency amplification before an appropriate volume can be obtained. Therefore, in a new-style radio with only one stage of low-frequency amplification, it is necessary to modify the detector tube circuit or even add another stage of low-frequency amplification.</p>
<h3>First Diagram</h3>
<p>Recently, the United States has invented a new type of copper oxide pickup, which is constructed using the principle of an ordinary carbon microphone. As shown in the first diagram, T is a rubber cylinder filled with copper oxide particles, M is a metal sheet, and R is a rocker. When in use, the rocker swings up and down in the direction indicated by the arrow, and the resistance of the copper oxide also changes accordingly (the changing value is about 40,000 to 500,000 ohms). As a result, the output voltage naturally changes as well. Its function is similar to the case where a normal double-button carbon microphone changes its resistance when subjected to external sound waves.</p>
<h3>Second Diagram</h3>
<p>The second diagram shows the wiring method for a copper oxide pickup. SW is a single-pole double-throw switch, which is thrown downward when in use. R is a volume control installed on the pickup. The power source of the pickup is taken from the B circuit, and voltages from 25 to 250 volts are applicable, while the current is less than one milliampere. Such a small amount of power will not be a problem even when used in a dry battery radio. (The second diagram shows the wiring method of the pickup in a single-tube low-frequency amplifier, so the other button is not connected. If it is used in a push-pull amplifier, both buttons can be connected.)</p>
<p>The special advantages of a copper oxide pickup are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The output electrical energy is extremely large. Only one stage of low-frequency amplification is needed to obtain a loud volume.</p>
<p>(2) The resistance of the pickup itself is extremely large (the average resistance is about 100,000 ohms), so it can be directly connected to any radio for use, without the need to add matching transformers or other parts.</p>
<p>(3) The tone is complete. Both high and low tones can be fully released.</p>
<p>(4) The sound quality is beautiful. Because the internal structure is of the push-pull type, it can avoid various distortions.</p>
<p>(5) It is very lightweight. The weight is less than two ounces (the weight of a typical magnet pickup is about three ounces or more), so the record is not easily damaged when in use.</p>
<p>(6) It is simple and durable, unlike typical magnetic pickups, which often have the risk of broken wires and loss of magnetism.</p>
<h3>An Economical Two-Tube AC Radio</h3>
<p>— Yongyan</p>
<p>The radio described in this article is one that I recently designed and tested and found to be satisfactory. The features of this machine are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Economical in Parts: The machine has only two vacuum tubes, but it actually has the effect of three vacuum tubes. This is because the 6F7 vacuum tube in this machine is composed of a triode and a high-gain pentode; therefore, one tube can be used in place of two tubes (not a reflex circuit). The B voltage is taken directly from the power line, and the A voltage is supplied by rewinding a doorbell transformer. Therefore, the equipment for a high-voltage power transformer can be omitted. The speaker is a permanent magnet type. Also, because the current passing through the speaker is very small, the equipment to prevent burning out the coil can also be omitted. The regeneration is adjusted by a rotating coil rack, which can save some parts. Efforts are made to reduce the number of machine parts under the condition of not changing or damaging the radio's effectiveness.</p>
<p>B. Economical in Electricity Consumption: The machine has been measured using a kilowatt-hour meter, and it is estimated that it can be operated for about 100 hours per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If calculated at a market price of 18 cents per kilowatt-hour, it is even more economical than a power-saving single-tube machine that consumes one copper coin per hour of electricity.</p>
<p>C. With slight modifications, it can be converted into a DC or battery type.</p>
<p>When the machine was tested in the Nanshi area of Shanghai, it used an indoor antenna, and the ground wire was connected to the window. The broadcast received was extremely loud and the tone was realistic. The selectivity was also good. It can also be used without a ground and air line.</p>
<p>The circuit diagram is attached. The wiring method for the F7 tube socket is shown in the upper right corner of the diagram. To the right of it is the radio section, which uses the triode part of the 6F7 for feedback detection, and then uses its pentode part as a single-stage audio frequency amplifier for input.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Output to the speaker. The central part is the power supply section, which uses a 丨V vacuum tube for half-wave rectification and a doorbell transformer to supply the filament current. The values of the other components are as follows: LLIL2 uses No. 26 enameled wire on a spiderweb board; F, five turns for local stations and sixteen turns for outside stations, LI, sixty turns, L2, forty-three turns. C○○○five variable capacitor, CI○○five fixed capacitor, C2○○○two five mica type, C3C6 one megamicrofarad, C4 two megamicrofarads, C5 four megamicrofarads. R three hundred and fifty ohms, R1 three million ohms, R2 fifty thousand ohms, R3 thirty thousand ohms. AFT three-to-one audio frequency transformer. AFC thirty henries twenty milliamperes choke coil. PT transformer for supplying filament current, using a doorbell transformer with its secondary coil rewound into two coils of six point three volts. Other vacuum tubes, speakers, etc.</p>
<h3>Rain Protection Method for Lead-in Wires</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Lead-in wires, coming down from high places, easily draw in rainwater whenever it is overcast or raining. As a result, not only does electrical energy leak, but also various items in the room may get wet. If it flows into the radio, it may even damage the machine parts. To avoid this, a small coin can be tied to the lead-in wire at the point where it enters the room, and the rainwater will drip down along the wire (see the diagram). If the lead-in wire is very stiff, simply bend it into a U-shape at the point where it enters (as shown in the circle in the diagram).</p>
<h3>Radio in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Renrong</p>
<p>I recently read a book called "Soviet Education," which talks about the situation of radio in the Soviet Union, and I would like to introduce it as follows:</p>
<p>The "Society of Friends of Radio" is an amateur organization in the Soviet Union, with a membership of one million people. Workers, students, and Red Army soldiers are all free to participate. As a result, there are as many as 20,000 branches. There are also dozens of radio schools established by the local societies, about 60 factories manufacturing parts, and more than 100 consulting rooms dedicated to answering and guiding researchers with any problems they encounter at any time. Many periodicals, pamphlets, and slogans are popular everywhere, striving to make radio knowledge as common as everyday meals.</p>
<p>Their broadcasting business is entirely used as a cultural medium. They broadcast domestic and foreign news twice a day, morning and evening, similar to our country's central radio station. There are morning exercises, academic lectures, foreign language instruction, and art programs, which are nothing more than singing and music. Of course, there are no low-level, sensational programs. Moscow also runs a radio university, broadcasting university courses at scheduled times.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, it is not necessary to register radios. There is also no need to pay for listening. Listening to the radio is absolutely free. Compared to the areas of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia where listening to central broadcasts is prohibited, they are worlds apart. Clubs, factories, miners' yards, parks, and Red Corners (similar to public teahouses) and other public places are equipped with large loudspeakers. A single-tube radio for personal use costs about ten rubles, and almost everyone has one. Even in the poor and remote Black Sea coast and within Ukraine, they can listen to Moscow broadcasts. In 1933, there were 59 radio stations nationwide, with a total power of 1498KW. Compared to our country's 70+ radio stations with a total power of only about 90KW, it is truly a deformity. This year, they will add more than a dozen large radio stations in Siberia and the Arctic. Moscow's Ren and Beri's RW15 shortwave broadcasts can be heard around the world. There are occasional reports in English and Chinese. In our country, a shortwave radio with one or two number 30 tubes is enough to receive them very loudly.</p>

<h3>Drastic Changes in Specie Prices</h3>
<p>Silver Market Soars, Rumors of 881.3 Yuan Outside the Market Resurface, Recovering to 916 Yuan After Closing</p>
<h3>Resulting in a Drop of Only 1.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the specie market was extremely turbulent, with very large fluctuations. It initially plummeted due to a sharp rise in the silver markets in England and the United States. It then recovered as large traders maintained their positions, and market sentiment turned positive, returning above the 900 yuan mark. Rumors resurfaced after the closing, and after-hours trading rose more than ten yuan compared to the previous close. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw a uniform surge in England and the United States, which truly shocked traders. London gold rose nine pence, while exchange rates also rose. Prices and stocks in the United States both rose. When after-hours trading opened, it broke the 900 yuan mark and fell to 881.2 yuan. According to reports, after the rise in gold prices in London, Japanese cash was being sold off to London in large quantities, with quite a bit being smuggled out of the country. The November futures deadline was approaching, and after the drastic drop in the specie market, the source of spot supplies became even more obstructed, making it difficult for short sellers to feel secure. They aggressively bought to cover their positions at low prices, which led to good market sentiment. The opening price rose, with Yuan Yi Hongxing, Da Fa, Yongheng, Yu Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, Qianchang, Xianghui, Xiangxiang and others buying aggressively, driving up prices continuously, but after the opening the price flattened. However, buying interest from major traders was strong. After falling and rising, it briefly hit a low of 884.5 yuan, but due to strong maintenance, it soon pulled up again. The exchange rate was also the same, with buyers being quite active. Market sentiment was favorable, and the forward premium rose. The specie price then rose back above 900 yuan, but at this point there was a lot of profit-taking. Later, a foreign telegram stated that radical members of the U.S. banking community were said to be immediately pursuing expansion. The market turned downward after the high, but the banks were still snapping up shillings and Chinese traders were also taking in U.S. dollars, making it difficult for the exchange rate to loosen. The forward premium had already risen to four yuan, and rumors that a certain major trader was deliberately pushing the price up were still rife. The exchange rate then tightened and rose again above 900 yuan, with even stronger buying. The price rose back 9.5 yuan before noon. The midday closing was slightly hesitant, but the underlying trend was very bullish. The afternoon market opened with the exchange rate going from tight to loose, and the specie market also went from high to low, but it did not break the 900 yuan mark. The first telegram from Bombay reported a decrease of 2.3 annas, but it then rose again, but was still hovering. The trend had the potential to turn bullish. Market sentiment was uniformly positive, and efforts were being made to settle contracts. The exchange market lacked sellers and tended to tighten, so it rose to 900 yuan. The second telegram from Bombay reported an increase of 9.1 annas. It once fell slightly by five yuan, but buyers still poured in to maintain the price. The closing price actually rose back above the 900 yuan mark, falling only slightly by one yuan compared to the previous close. Unexpectedly, the market became even more turbulent after the close. Fuxingyong and the Guangdong traders came up to buy aggressively. Market sentiment was apprehensive, and rumors resurfaced, with various predictions unfavorable to short sellers. Buying interest was strong for a time, rising back to 916 yuan. Later, it gradually fell back more than ten yuan, and it was nearly six o'clock. The day saw prices first falling and then rising, and the reaction was so strong that it was beyond expectation. Although the silver market rose so sharply, even if the market opened low, not much was seen. However, the rebound was so strong, partly due to fears of a large short squeeze in forward contracts, and news threatening sellers. The general short sellers could not help but shake their heads and sigh. Now I will record the market situation for the day.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 886 yuan, a drastic drop of 15.7 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange market opened with the recent selling price of the British exchange at one shilling six pence four three seven five, the U.S. exchange at 37.8125 yuan. Citibank came out with the November U.S. dollar at 8125, and then Hua Bi also set the December price at 9375, but retreated to five yuan. Yuan Chun Heng Yu Fuxing Yongfu An Yuan Mao Yong Yuan Yi Heng Xing Yuan Lai Jin rose 8.5 yuan. Mitsui released the November U.S. dollar at 875, and Chunyuan, Yongheng, Yu Huixiang, and the Dalian traders sold off, falling to 5.5 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Shenkang, Zhengchang then bought, and the bank took up November at half a penny, rising to 7.5 yuan. It was learned that the HSBC posted British exchange at half a penny, and the U.S. exchange was long by 1.25 yuan. The domestic market hardened, and Hua Bi set the January U.S. dollar at 38.0625 yuan. Qingyu, Zhengchang, Hengyu, Hengchang, Yong Yuanyi and others sold futures, causing it to fall to 4.5 yuan. Market sentiment was still stable, and after the low, there were many buyers in the market. Major traders such as Qianchang, Fuchang, Yuqing, Yong Yuanchang, Yong Yuanchang, Yong Maoyong, Yongfu An, Yongli Dada De cheng, Yongfeng and others continuously purchased, and Chinese traders settled accounts. The November U.S. dollar was already 8125, gradually rising to 91 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, Yuqing, Yong Yuanchang, Yong Yuanyong, Yong Maoyong, Yongyuancheng seized the opportunity to sell at high prices. Dongfang HSBC set the December U.S. dollar at 9375, falling to 88.3 yuan. Hengyu, Fuyu, Dafa Yong Hengxing Yuanyuan Kangxiang Tianfengyong and others still had buying appetite. Zhengjin took up the January U.S. dollar at 38 yuan, and Magary took up October at five six two five, rising to 91.8 yuan. Zhejiang released the January U.S. dollar at 875, and Citibank set the January U.S. dollar at 9375. Shunmao, Fuan, Dadecheng, Fuchang and others sold off, and foreign telegrams stated that radical members of the U.S. banking community had demanded to immediately engage in expansion, gradually falling back to 87.3 yuan. Hua Bi also set the November U.S. dollar at 8125. Then Hua Bi took up January at half a penny, and the market stabilized again. Dafa Yongheng Chang Yong Qingyu Qianchangxiang Yuqingyong Yongli and others worked hard to buy, and then rose back to 92.4 yuan. Hengyu Yuqing Yong Yifengyong slightly sold off at high prices. After that, it was once flat and weak, retreating to within one yuan, at 0.4 yuan, but Hengxingyuan bought in from time to time, and finally pulled up. Hengxingyuan Hengyu Yongli Zhaofeng Chang Daxingyong and others suddenly became interested in buying, and rose to 94 yuan. Fuchang Fuxingyong Yuanyong seized the opportunity to supply at high prices, gradually retreating to 1.7 yuan, but Hengyu still came to maintain the price. The midday closing was 892.5 yuan. After the closing, buying interest was still strong, and it rose back to around four yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 893.1 yuan. Yuanshengyong and others bought outside the market, once making 4.5 yuan. Hua Bi came out with the January U.S. dollar at 8125, and then the Guangdong traders set 875, making it even more difficult to sell, causing the specie price to gradually fall from 3.5 yuan. Yifengyong and others supplied futures, retreating to 1 yuan. Fuxingyong Yuanyi advanced to beyond 2 yuan, but the domestic market loosened, and Hua Bi set the January U.S. dollar at 875. Dalian traders Yuanyaoyong Hengyu sold off, falling further to zero and three yuan. Bombay decreased by two annas. Zhaofeng Chang Fuxingyong competed to buy, rising back to 4.5 yuan. Hengyu Fuan seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, retreating to 2.1 yuan. Yuqing Yongrui Kang advanced to 3.2 yuan, but Yongfeng Fuyu sold off, retreating again to 1.8 yuan. Market sentiment was still good. Dadecheng Tianfeng Fuyu and others bought in succession, gradually rising to 900 yuan, but Chinese traders vigorously grabbing U.S. dollars in November at five six two five had become difficult to settle. Hua Bi came out with half a yuan for the November U.S. dollar. Shengda Hengxing sold off and slightly declined. Then, when the Bombay telegram rose by nine annas, Yuanmaoyong Hongxing Shengda and others competed to sell, and a selling mood arose, falling back slightly to 5.5 yuan. Hengchang Yongrichang took up contracts at low prices, rising to 6.8 yuan. Fuyu was still selling, retreating to 5.8 yuan, but the trend was very bullish and market sentiment was favorable. Yifengyong and others bought continuously, and the rising trend intensified, rising back to 901 yuan. Fuyu sold off, and the closing price was 900.3 yuan. After the closing, a buying mood suddenly arose, and the turmoil was great. It was found that the highest price during the day was 901 yuan, and the lowest price was 884.5 yuan, with a total fluctuation of 16.5 yuan. As a result, it fell lower by 1.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>After the closing, a storm was stirred up, with extremely large fluctuations, mainly because Fuxingyong Dingchang and others were all buying, especially Fuxingyong. It rose to beyond 909 yuan, mainly because there were sudden rumors in the market about reducing the silver content of silver coins, as well as news that the measures for silver had been decided, which were unfavorable to short sellers. Yuanyi Dadecheng seized the opportunity to sell off at high prices, retreating again to within 7 yuan. Hengxing Sheng Yuqingyong Shengda Zhentai and others came back to buy aggressively, and the situation was in great chaos, actually breaking through ten yuan and rising to 15 or 16 yuan. Fuxingyong Yuanyaoyong Fuchang seized the opportunity to sell futures, retreating again to ten yuan. Futai Heng Hongxing was still taking in contracts. At this time, it was struggling around ten yuan. Later, Dadecheng Dalian traders came to sell, and it fell to 07 yuan, but Fuxingyong Hengchangyong was still taking in contracts, rising back to 9.5 yuan. Finally, Yuanmaoyong and others sold futures from time to time, and gradually retreated to 05 yuan. The trend was slightly weak.</p>
<p>The number of new standard chips for the December period has increased to more than 8,000, all of which are forward transactions. The same was true today, and the posted prices were still based on the November standard. The morning opening price retreated to 886 yuan, the midday closing price was 892.5 yuan, and the afternoon opening price was 893.1 yuan. The closing price was 900.3 yuan, also down 1.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was calculated using the HSBC U.S. dollar posting, which was long by 1.25 yuan, at 37.5 yuan, corresponding to a specie price of 922.67 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was pressing down by approximately 22 yuan, which was approximately 30 yuan less than the previous close. For the December new standard, the standard specie price posted by the Central Bank was 925.5 yuan, corresponding to a pressing down of approximately 25 yuan based on the closing price, which was approximately 16 yuan less than the previous close. The book entry for this month was 893 yuan, with November and December at the same price. The water supplement in the morning was 893 yuan, with November and December at the same price. The book entry for the afternoon was 900 yuan for this month, with November and December at the same price. The price of pure gold was 896.5 yuan, up approximately 10.5 yuan. As the specie price fell, the water supplement should have been more expensive. There was a lack of transactions in the market, mainly because spot sellers had no appetite to sell, and the traders lacked sources. The Central Bank still had buying intentions. The forward spread between November and December ranged from 2.5 yuan to 4 yuan. Hengxing Shengda Fuchang Dalian traders added premiums, and Daxing Yongxiang Fengyong Fengheng Fuxingyong and others paid premiums.</p>
<p>In the market, buying traders were excited. In summary, 17 traders, including Yuanyi Qianchangxiang, were on the buying side, and 15 traders, including Tongtaichang Wanxing, were on the selling side. Hongkangyong Dadecheng and others advanced and then retreated, and Dachangxiang and others retreated first and then advanced. Dalian traders and Wanxing together made approximately 4,400 contracts, netting out more than 400 contracts. Shunli together made approximately 1,900 contracts, netting out more than 400 contracts. In addition, there were also two traders who added premiums on forward contracts. Guangdong traders Hengxing advanced more than 200 and retreated approximately 100. Shengda advanced approximately 500 and retreated more than 100. There were rumors in the market that a certain bank aggressively bought more than 1,000 contracts, and a certain major trader's buying interest continued to be strong.</p>
<p>Silver Prices Unexpectedly Soar</p>
<h3>Limited Relaxation in the Exchange Market</h3>

After opening, it was flat, then the HSBC bank's listed price was revealed, with British exchange rising half a penny and U.S. exchange rising one yuan two five, temporarily trending hard. However, with people's hearts calming down and the gold market remaining stable, it gradually tightened afterward. Chinese merchants also increased their buying, but banks were also shorting shillings. Although the news was bad, it did not hinder the overall situation, and it trended towards tightening along with the gold market, likely because the psychology of the deficit side seemed to be shaken. In the afternoon market, banks and the Kwong (Guangdong) banks slightly filled and then loosened, while the Bombay exchange rate fell two annas and then tightened back. Chinese merchants were extremely eager to short, banks had no selling appetite and were even tighter. News came that the Bombay exchange rate had risen nine annas, banks slightly filled in the near term, but the closing potential remained strong. The closing selling prices for the near term were British exchange at one shilling six pence two five, U.S. exchange at thirty-seven yuan four three seven five, compared to the previous close, British exchange loosened 0.0625, U.S. exchange hardened 3.125.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Gradually Cooling Down</h3>
<p>In previous years, this transition between autumn and winter was the time when all industries were flourishing and the silver dollar market was lively. However, in recent years, due to rural bankruptcies and various businesses feeling precarious, the silver dollar market has become increasingly cold and lacks prospects for prosperity. Yesterday, the market for silver dollar short-term loans opened at six cents in both the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. Adding interest to forward contracts consistently resulted in flat rates. The transaction volume for short-term loans was over 3.8 million in the morning market, including transfers and new transactions, 400,000+ in the afternoon. Transactions at the Small Exchange Association totaled over 600,000. Silver dollar mortgage transactions: redemptions were over 800,000, new mortgages were over 900,000.

<h3>Kwangtung Silver Drops Over One Yuan</h3>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Fluctuate Greatly</h3>
<p>Strong actual sales and short covering caused prices to rise.</p>
<p>Japanese yarn fell, Indian cotton traded, causing prices to fall.</p>
<p>| Unable to escape the influence of rising silver prices |</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation turned soft again, but the actual needs of buyers from various regions are still high, resulting in good sentiment and strong short covering. In the afternoon, news that silver prices had greatly risen and the calculation of the price of Toyo Sanpin yarn had greatly fallen, and that Japanese merchants were still dumping long-term contracts on our country's marked yarn market. Another message, cheap Indian cotton, was ordered by Shenxin Factory for more than 10,000 pieces, because of this, popularity suddenly declined.</p>
<p>In the marked yarn market, the market opened in the morning with a rise in American cotton, but the silver price was particularly long, and the city fell sharply. The calculation of the price of foreign goods fell sharply, so some of them took the opportunity to sell in large quantities. However, the general retail investors still bought in, and the saying that the unified tax would increase again was prevalent, and each month rose seven, eight, nine corners to one yuan. The market opened in the afternoon and was still expensive. There were 3,600 bales of existing yarn transactions that were not good, but when they were auctioned to three closings, the downwind suddenly rose. It was heard that various Chinese and foreign factories had purchased 20,000-30,000 cheap Indian cotton pieces. Each month fell by one yuan and one jiao to one yuan three and four jiao. The daily trading statistics totaled 59,500 packages. It was found that Renfeng sold 5,550 packages, Gengfeng 1,950 packages, Jifeng 600 packages, Dafu 1,300 packages, Dafeng 900 packages, Yuanda 500 packages, Huikang 500 packages, Yicheng 600 packages, Changji 1,100 packages, Junchang 700 packages, Yuande 1,100 packages, Taichang 850 packages, Xiecheng 1,100 packages, Tongfu bought 4,450 packages, Dafeng 3,150 packages, Tongji 800 packages, Suilong 600 packages, Tongxing 650 packages, Runkang 1,500 packages, Xiecheng 400 packages, Dachang 600 packages, Changfeng 450 packages.

<p>There are still many sales of existing yarn. It was found that the total statistics of purchases by various regions throughout the day were 3,600 packages. The market first rose and then fell. The amount of purchases by various regions is as follows: Changsha 270, same industry 385, North China 80, Yunnan 40, Tianjin 955, Jiangxi 70, Shantou 270, Xiamen 10, Guangdong 490, Mainland China 1010, Ningbo 5, Nanjing 25. A large number of Indian cotton invaded.</p>
<h3>Sudden Increase in Selling of Forward Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market first rose and then fell. Due to the rise in the U.S. and Indian cotton markets, the bulls' intentions were firm, and the amount absorbed was not released. In the afternoon, it was heard that Japanese merchants had ordered 16,000 pieces of Indian cotton the previous day, and that Shenxin had also purchased 14,000 pieces today. Because the price was cheap, people's hearts were shaken and the selling trend suddenly rose, and the market price fell.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Cotton Suddenly Drops After Rising</h3>
<p>In the marked cotton market, the market opened in the morning due to the rebound in U.S. and Indian cotton. Unexpectedly, the silver price rose sharply, and the calculated market price fell instead. Therefore, it seemed to be still flat, but the bulls still absorbed it and did not release it, and each month rose one and a half corners to two corners. The market opened in the afternoon and was still expensive. When the auction reached three closings, it suddenly fell, and the situation became weak again. Because there were 20,000-30,000 cheap Indian cotton pieces being made, the selling trend was strong, and each month fell by two or three corners. The total daily trading volume was 137,700 dan. It was found that Tonghe sold 2,400 dan, Taichang 5,300 dan, Gengfeng 7,700 dan, Jifeng 5,100 dan, Dafu 2,400 dan, Yuanda 2,100 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Yichang 2,500 dan, Xincheng 1,800 dan, Xinheng 2,2.</p>

<h3>Shenxin Imports 12,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>The sales of existing cotton are still clear, but Indian cotton has a tendency to overwhelm the market again. According to reliable news, Japanese merchants ordered 16,000 pieces of Agura at 39 yuan and Kandipur at 37 yuan on the previous day. Today, Shenxin Factory purchased 12,000 pieces of Kandipur cotton, priced at 37 yuan, to be delivered to the factory in November and December. The source is calculated as 1,200 bales of Tonghua and 1,500 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<p>Pengde Flower 48.00 Samexing Factory entered 100 pieces to the factory</p>
<h3>All Foreign Cotton Prices Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton rose sharply due to purchases by speculators, political news favorable to buyers, and short covering. The spot price rose 25 points, and the futures price rose 18 to 25 points. British cotton futures rose 18-19 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to short covering and purchases by speculators, but then returned due to sales by European exporters and Japanese merchants. As a result, Pingor rose 2.25 rupees, Omra rose 4.5 rupees, and Bailaoxi rose 4.75 rupees. The original telegram record (November 11th telegram):</p>

<h3>Public Bonds See-Sawing, with Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Only Seven Types of Stocks Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, in view of the considerable circulation of stocks of various companies and firms in the market, specially increased spot buying and selling for convenience. Yesterday was the first day of trading, and seven types of stocks were traded. The market price was highest at 102 yuan for the buying price of Shanghai Bank. As a result, trading in various bonds did not see a surge. Although the market price was relatively strong, it still had a mixed and chaotic appearance. Apart from term trading being relatively lively, there were very few inquiries about new buying and selling. The trend is still brewing and waiting for changes. Yesterday, the market opened with a unanimous rise, but the amount was only one or two corners. However, the 23rd Customs Bond for this month rose sharply by six corners due to the need for the 16th. In the next round, it entered a mixed and chaotic state, with highs and lows interspersed, and the amount was very small. The market opened in the afternoon, and the 4th and 23rd bonds were slightly sold off, showing slight weakness. The closing price continued to fall by one or two corners, and the situation did not show any development. It is temporarily feared that it will not be able to escape the old trajectory of see-sawing. The market price results showed mixed gains and losses, with more gains than losses. The total transaction volume was 11,125,500 yuan. In addition, there were 140 shares of various stocks. The details of the gains and losses and the market prices of various company stocks are compared and listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan, stock unit: one share).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Advance</h3>
<p>New Fung Yang Company reported that yesterday (11th), the New York stock market continued to advance. The trading volume was unprecedented since mid-summer. The market rise was based on expansion hopes. President Roosevelt has recognized the need to raise prices, and Senator Chamberlin also claimed that he believes the U.S. dollar may be devalued again. At the same time, it is rumored that the next Congress will remove the 50% devaluation limit. Other favorable factors include the soaring silver price, breaking the New York-London five-year record, and the public's expectation of commercial progress. The bond market rose due to the financial community's progressive attitude. Although U.S. government bonds were threatened by expansion, prices still rose. Small exchange stocks also rose, and silver stocks were in particularly high demand. Chicago wheat rose due to inflationary air and reports of damage to wheat production. The daily transaction volume was 1.39 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Flour Prices See Another Slight Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the market opened in the morning, the market for each month generally showed a firm and stable trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat was 1.12 yuan higher for the near term in Chicago, and 0.89 yuan higher for the long term. Canadian wheat rose by about 45 cents. When the price was opened, due to the continuous rise in foreign wheat, people outside the industry were not optimistic. Therefore, each market was better by about one point. The rise in foreign wheat and the exchange rate are also gradually lengthening, so there are no problems with the order of foreign wheat. The peace of the rise is probably because of this. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the factories were all watching and not selling, and the customer group had a few sporadic businesses. The near and far markets were slightly more expensive, but the transaction was very quiet. The follow-up will be in a rotating situation. As a result, this month rose by two cents, November was 1.25 cents higher, December was 1.75 cents higher, January was two cents higher, and February was 2.5 cents higher.</p>
<h3>U.S. Wheat Reported Higher, Local Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the futures wheat market, after the market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a trend of nearly long-term rise. The quoted price of foreign wheat was about 0.89 yuan to 1.12 yuan higher in Chicago, and 45 cents higher in Canada. When the price was opened, the market sentiment for this month was still flat, because the current wheat on the market was only about 0.35 yuan higher. The inability of the standard to cheer up is not allowed by the facts. The various months in the long term were also flat at first. By the afternoon, the flour market was very stable and the price of foreign wheat continued to rise, and the outside buyers became lively again, so the degree of the rise gradually became sharp. As a result, this month did not move, November was 0.4 cents higher, December was 0.5 cents higher, January was 0.8 cents higher, and February was 0.7 cents higher. In the current wheat market, because the flour market is slightly better, each file raised the asking price by two or three cents. Shandong Wuhe Bengbu Suzhou Linhuai wheat opened at 3.35 yuan, Haizhou Yaowan wheat at 3.3 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 3.25 yuan. 7,000 bags were sent from Fuxin and 1,000 bags were sent from Fufeng.</p>
<p>The saying that the United States will inflate the currency has become popular again in Wall Street. Business has also improved slightly, so the market in various places is strong and strong. The stock market rose by about two yuan, the price of cotton per package rose by more than one yuan, and wheat was 0.3 yuan higher. The news of currency inflation came because the White House announced yesterday (10th) that the president wanted to raise prices, and today (11th), after Congressman Buckland discussed future monetary policy with the president, he claimed that the dollar could be devalued again. The wheat market in Chicago is added to the good news from abroad. The southwestern producing areas are still short of rain. Wheat is therefore extremely strong, and all profits are absorbed. All parties are repurchasing, and shorts are covering their positions. The price will continue to rise, and there will be occasional headwinds. Closing price of Chicago wheat on October 10 Closing price on October 11 Up or down</p>

<h3>Quanzhou Coins, Second Batch of Big Bubble Yuan Opens Again</h3>
<p>The second batch of more than 1,900 boxes of Quanzhou Big Bubble Yuan coins that arrived on the previous Fortune Wheel have been held up for many days due to the price increase. This morning, each line was invited to evaluate the price, and it was not until 5 pm that all the coins were opened. The price was one to several corners higher than the previous batch. The highest file was about 32 yuan, the second file was reduced, and the middle file was from 26-27 yuan to about 20 yuan. The lower file was from 16-17 yuan to 10 yuan up and down. It is said that there will be 1,600 pieces in the next batch, which will arrive today or tomorrow. The cost is higher, and it may need to continue to increase.</p>

<h3>The Form and Legacy of Art (I)</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>What is form? Form is the phenomenon or morphology of things. Phenomenon and essence (content) are not entirely the same, but they cannot be mechanically separated. In art, the main expression of form lies in the writer's style. The primary task of an artist is to capture the content of art from reality, and then, with their unique genius, give it artistic processing. In this process, the artist's greatest effort is in finding a form that corresponds to the content and can enhance the influence of the content, that is, the artist's unique style, to express the reality of the things captured.</p>
<p>Reality is extremely complex, and human social life is full of countless contradictions and unities. Therefore, in the development of events, in the character, actions, emotions, and words of people who are the cells of society, all reflect the various elements of this complex social reality. Real life contains all the living ingredients of human joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, humor, sarcasm, solemnity, wit, love, hate, foolishness, and intelligence. They are intertwined and penetrate each other, expressed through the character, actions, emotions, and words of people. Therefore, artists are required to adopt a comprehensive style (form) to express this complex reality that is both contradictory and unified. Needless to say, this comprehensive form should also permeate elements of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, humor, sarcasm, solemnity, wit, love, hate, foolishness, and intelligence.</p>
<p>Chernyshevsky said: "From the profound observation of history and modern life, it has been proven that even those who are not judged to be evil villains or heroic figures are committing more terrifying crimes and more uplifting great deeds than anything poets have ever imagined." This can be taken as a strong footnote to what we're saying.</p>
<p>We cannot find a great artist without this comprehensive form, even if we search throughout history. In the works of classic great artists such as Shakespeare, Balzac, Goethe, and Tolstoy, we can find expressions of this comprehensive form everywhere. Modern life is more complex than in the past. Our writers should strengthen this comprehensive form even more, but the fact proves that we have not paid enough attention to this point. The formulaic approach of the past goes without saying, but even now, this formulaic approach has not been completely eliminated. Some of Mr. Zhang Tianyi's recent works have left many readers feeling a bit "that way," perhaps because the author deliberately used a comical or humorous form. In reality, real life is not just about this one element; it has many other elements intertwined. Shakespeare's brilliant prophecy of "[Shakespeare's Falstaff]" is because Shakespeare's artistic form is most representative of this comprehensive form. Isn't this something worth our attention and consideration?</p>
<p>(II) Here, I am reminded of the issue of artistic heritage that is currently being discussed in literary circles. We know that artists like Shakespeare, Balzac, Goethe, and Tolstoy had consciousnesses that went against history. However, because they constantly explored reality, the process of practice gradually eroded, dissolved, and even shattered their worldviews. They all experienced contradictions between their worldview and their creative methods. As everyone knows, these contradictions were "negative" (Minrs) rather than "positive" (Plrs) for their works. In that case, their consciousness is irrelevant to us today. Yet we like their works, and not only like them, but also want to inherit their legacy. Is it because their works have "eternal human nature"? I don't think so. The "permanence" of artistic works is due to the concrete (figurative) typical facts and figures based on reality. And these things are expressed by artists in a comprehensive form, so we always feel that those figures are lifelike. It is this that made Aristotle see "philosophical significance" in poetry and consider poetry far superior to history. However, "permanence" cannot be viewed from a static point of view; this "permanence" is dynamic. Because mankind is constantly progressing, mankind's worldview is constantly progressing, and mankind views these classical arts, as with everything else, through the prism of their worldview. Different worldviews yield different meanings. For example, Ostrovsky's plays have recently been extremely popular in his home country, from cities to remote villages, but plots, and even characters, that detract from the modern significance of the works have been removed.</p>
<p>Since the great art of the classics is irrelevant to us in terms of thought, then what can be our legacy must be in terms of form. But doesn't this contradict the principle that form and content cannot be mechanically separated?</p>
<p>From the point of view of formal logic, this makes some sense. Unfortunately, this is not the case in reality. Was Fadeyev, the author of "The Rout," not greatly influenced by Tolstoy's psychological descriptions? Yet their works represent two different worlds. Why is that? First, because the worldviews of classical artists are eroded by reality, although there are remnants of anti-historical consciousness in their works, most of them reflect the reality of the historical development process; second, our inheritance of legacy is not blind imitation, but conscious acquisition, so we can take the good and discard the bad.</p>
<p>In the clamor for great works, in addition to strengthening the writer's social practice, the issue of the comprehensive form and legacy of art cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Japanese Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Luo De</p>
<p>Recent Two Speedy Events</p>
<p>It's not meant to be self-deprecating, but at least from our Chinese perspective, it's an amazing speed worthy of our sighing.</p>
<p>This is my first time in Japan, and I arrived in Kobe from Taiwan. On the night of September 20th, right after landing in Kobe, there was a wind, though not very strong, so it wasn't surprising or frightening. However, the newspapers on the morning of the 21st already warned that Osaka (the Kansai area) and its vicinity had been hit by a hurricane. At the same time, the hurricane continued to rage until the morning of the 23rd when it was known that the hurricane had passed. However, extra editions of major newspapers were distributed in rapid succession. As for the damage caused by the hurricane and the details, I believe there are considerable records in domestic newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them here. However, it seems necessary to recount the various situations after this hurricane, especially the two things of publicity and relief.</p>
<p>The most effective publicity for this hurricane and flood, apart from the press, was the Japanese film industry, which had concrete publicity and sufficient strength. In the few days from the evening of the 20th to the morning of the 23rd, the area hit by the hurricane was extensive, but all the losses and traces from all sides were compiled by the 24th, and on the 25th, the newsreels of the hurricane flood were shown in theaters all over Japan. So I also spent a yen to visit and take a look. The filming was very clear, and the materials collected were really a lot. According to what was reported in the newspapers, it can be said that 80-90% of the affected areas were included in the film. This kind of speedy film publicity has never been seen in China, but in Japan, it is not even considered unusual. However, in any case, we take it as a lesson, and the domestic film industry will urgently catch up in order to serve the country.</p>
<p>Seeing the various shots taken in the newsreel aroused my curiosity, so in the afternoon of the 26th, I went from Kobe to Osaka to visit and see for myself. Based on the so-called disaster areas recorded in the newspapers, I visited the addresses. In Osaka, the more bustling streets damaged by the hurricane and water had already restored traffic as usual by the afternoon of the 26th. The roads were still clean and tidy, and it didn't look like a place that had suffered such a major disaster. After investigation, it was learned that the Japanese government had been working day and night to restore it. Even in the areas where the disaster was more serious, there were no longer the dilapidated traces seen in the film. In the near future, or even now, we can see the same prosperity as before the disaster, perhaps even more prosperous. If we compare it to the situation in our country, there is a real difference between heaven and earth. What is the situation of the floods and droughts in our country? What about the ruins and rubble in Zhabei? Comparing it to the situation in our country, what should the people and the authorities think!</p>
<p>Introducing this fact to the country is not just for people to read and then consider it a small news item. I sincerely hope that the people of the country pay attention to this situation, emulate it, and catch up.</p>

<h3>Hawking</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Night on the Riverbank (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>If she had been kind and gentle, I could have just made do with sleeping in my clothes, but her unpleasant expression made me extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"How can you make do? ... Who would be willing to pay to sleep in a hostel like this?"</p>
<p>"Sir, when you come to our place, you have to put up with a bit of hardship."</p>
<p>She then laughed coldly, as if mocking the visitor for being ignorant.</p>
<p>"Is this place so poor?"</p>
<p>Perhaps I showed a slight sneer on my face, because she turned down the corners of her mouth and said angrily:</p>
<p>"Where is it poor? Such a good place! ... It's just those damned, godforsaken things that come to rob one after another. ... And your merchant protection teams ... Hmph, they're only good once. ..."</p>
<p>A big foot stepped into the doorway, as if she was about to launch into a tirade, but I had been walking all day and was very tired, and I was also getting sleepy. Unable to stand her shouting, I quickly waved my hand and said:</p>
<p>"Forget it, forget it, I'll just sleep like this."</p>
<p>The bare wooden bed was very uncomfortable, and the river wind often seeped in through the cracks in the wall panels, so I was awake from about midnight onwards. I couldn't close my eyes. I could only hear the sound of the river waves hitting the shore, sometimes making me feel as if I was on a boat at sea.</p>
<p>"Tap tap tap ..." There was a series of knocks on the door outside the hostel, initially small and muffled, but gradually they grew louder and "Bang bang bang ..." rang out until even the little child inside the room was startled and suddenly cried. Then I heard the landlady respond hastily with a "Hey, hey," and run out to open the door.</p>
<p>"Fast asleep! Damn it! Coming this far at night!"</p>
<p>"Hehe! Is this a pumpkin that you guys grow in the mountains? ... Keep your voice down, keep your voice down, there's someone here tonight."</p>
<p>"I know, I know, ..."</p>
<p>The man's tone was angry and sarcastic. "People are just passing through ... You damned thing! ..."</p>
<p>"Big bundle?"</p>
<p>The man suddenly asked in a very soft voice, and the woman's answer was so low that I couldn't hear it. I then gently sat up, tilted my head and paid close attention, with a slight hint of fear. I happened to look out at the river through a crack in the wall panel, and outside it was a beautiful moonlit night. The black, oily river water crashed against the large rocks protruding from the river, splashing countless brilliant silver flowers. The cliffs on the opposite bank, and the bulging bellies of the cliffs, were all painted with layers of dark green treetops by the gray-white moonlight, making the darkness and coldness of the mountains at night seem particularly eerie. A traveler from afar comes to rest here at night, and is pushed into the river in the middle of the night - no one would ever find out. Ah, what a terrible place! I lay uneasily on the wooden bed, until dawn was about to break, and then I fell into a daze. When I woke up in the bright daylight, I felt very happy that I was still alive, and started making the things I wanted to eat in the morning.</p>
<p>The man who had come last night was like something out of a myth. He was nowhere to be seen in the morning. I only saw the landlady cutting a large, round, yellow pumpkin, skin and all, into a clay pot. Three children of different heights surrounded their mother, their greedy eyes wide open, licking their saliva-stained lips.</p>
<p>Taking a rough porcelain rice bowl at the table next to the water tank, I suddenly saw a small photo hanging on the wall. With the bright morning light shining in from the window, I could still distinguish the strong figures of two young military men from under a thin layer of dust. There were faint words on the side, and I realized what they meant when I looked closely:</p>
<p>"In the eighth year of the Republic of China, with Platoon Leader Xu in Luzhou, Sichuan. Later, Mr. Xu died in battle in Longquan, Chengdu. I respectfully present this last remaining photo to your wife for safekeeping.</p>
<p>"Respectfully presented by Chen Changyuan"</p>
<p>The handwriting was crude, probably written by someone of the same rank as a platoon leader. Looking back, I saw the children and their mother still enthusiastically cooking the pumpkin, and my heart couldn't help but grow heavy.</p>
<p>"Alas! What a blessing of war! (The End)</p>
<h3>Village Chief (25)</h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>A-Xian and A-De happily grabbed Dong Sheng and asked him to sit down. Dong Sheng limped and stuttered as he reported on that all-out brawl.</p>
<p>He was arrested for two weeks, and Shoufu Dapo was full of anger, with no place to vent it. Because the team wasn't training today, the brothers went to the city to carry vegetables, preparing salted vegetables for that time. He asked the squad leader for leave to go home once.</p>
<p>As soon as Shoufu Dapo returned to Niutoucai, he looked for Dong Sheng QueShou in every corner. He found him in the evening, and Shoufu Dapo and Dong Sheng QueShou ran into each other on the road.</p>
<p>It was truly a case of enemies meeting, they are especially clear.</p>
<p>"QueShou! Where have you been? I've been looking for you all day."</p>
<p>"Where else would I be, still busy with official business, running up Si'ao and down San'ao, killing people with exhaustion!"</p>
<p>"Killing me with exhaustion! Damn it! I'm going to settle the score with you." Saying this, Shoufu Dapo took a step forward and grabbed Dong Sheng QueShou's left hand.</p>
<p>"What a joke, we're all family, let's talk things out, what score is there to settle?" Dong Sheng QueShou was really quite amiable.</p>
<p>"I have no grudge against you in this life, no resentment from a previous life, why did you point me out, telling the squad leader to arrest me?" Saying this, he tightened his grip on Dong Sheng QueShou's left hand.</p>
<p>"Owa! Owa!" Dong Sheng QueShou shouted. "Let me go! How could I tell the squad leader to arrest you! How could I tell the squad leader to arrest you! Don't wrongly accuse people!"</p>
<p>"Wrongly accuse! I wrongly accuse you!" He tightened his grip again. Another "Owa!" "If it wasn't for you guys planning and scheming, wanting to plot against me, Shoufu Dapo, then if I was arrested, I wouldn't only get fifteen yuan a month. Busy season is here, and my old man isn't just sitting around doing nothing. Now that I've been pulled away, I can only contract the fields to others. Damn it, is fifteen yuan enough for me to spend? Damn it, I'm going, and A-Zhao is also going, why does he get twenty yuan, and I only get fifteen yuan!" He tightened his grip again!</p>

<h3>Starting from "Shenyang Population Surge"</h3>
<p>— HY</p>
<p>The following piece of news comes from a special telegram from Beiping in our newspaper on the 4th! The title is "Shenyang Population Surge:"</p>
<p>"News from outside the pass, since Japan implemented immigration to various places in the Northeast, due to the armed resistance of the people in Jidong and other places, most of the Japanese and Korean farmers who moved in concentrated in the cities. Also, due to the rampant bandits in various places in the Northeast, the Japanese are unable to maintain law and order, and many people in the counties are also concentrated in the cities. In mid-September, the population of Shenyang surged..."</p>
<p>Originally, a population surge is a manifestation of a prosperous city. According to the general theory of urban population growth, it is due to the economic bankruptcy of the countryside, and farmers cannot live in the countryside, so they throw themselves into the cities. However, the population surge in Shenyang is not for this reason, but because people cannot live in peace in the surrounding countryside. This makes it possible to imagine what Japanese imperialism's rule in the Northeast is like.</p>
<p>However, in the statistics, the population of Shenyang has indeed increased significantly, and isn't this something that the Japanese and puppet regimes can boast to the outside world about their urban prosperity?</p>
<p>But the fact is still the fact. The Japanese's inability to maintain rural law and order, which allows bandits to run rampant, is ironclad evidence. Whether they are bandits or righteous armies, as long as they are there, Japanese imperialism will feel the heat of suppressing them.</p>
<p>Faced with this phenomenon of population increase, we should think of the greatness of the impact of the anti-Japanese feats of the people in the Northeast. When the news of "Shenyang population decrease" is published, the Northeast will have become a comfortable nest for the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Traveler</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Stepping out of the house, I forcefully dragged my somewhat sore feet and hurried forward. The surroundings were as quiet as if it were night. I looked around in a panic, my chest felt sour, and I couldn't help but turn my head to look back. A woman was standing at the door of my house. My legs weakened and I almost fell. The bitter faces, furrowed brows, and mournful voices of my mother and sister struck my heartstrings again, shattering them! What good would walking away do? But it was impossible to stop and not go. I squeezed my bundle tightly, leaving the last alley called Houtou Lane. Everything in that alley was something I used to know well. In the dim and vague memories, these traces, bit by bit, pierced my heart deeply. It felt as if I was being crushed by Mount Tai, and I felt somewhat . The beautiful dreams of childhood reappeared in the miserable journey, flashing their afterimages, how could people not feel the infinite sadness of life's dramatic changes!</p>
<p>Winding and curving, I walked along many small paths between the fields. As I passed the ripe rice, the house gradually became less clear. Everything felt even more distant. Walking across a few small bridges, I went on foot up the undulating hills and mountains. I didn't hear the sound of birds, and I didn't see the cowherds or the farmers working in the fields. Apart from the distant mountains and the sky surrounding me, it was as if everything had died. Desolate and distant, a desolate wilderness lay in front of me. How could I go on? My feet kept moving, but my heart had no idea what to do. The tragic sound and shadow of my hometown had not yet disappeared. Thinking about how to walk through these countless desolate mountains and giant ridges, and how to find a place to return to? I had even less strength to walk. Step by step, I went up, the mountains became deeper and steeper, and my feet gradually became heavier and more painful. Each step was more sluggish than the last.</p>
<p>Sitting on the mountain path, I stared at the trees and black stones. There was no sound. Who could I tell my troubles to? There was no leisurely mood of solitude. Not knowing how to deal with the journey ahead, the traveler felt no emotional fluctuations at this moment, only coldness. It felt as if life was a piece of iron, a dead stone. But even a cold, dead stone must roll forward! I began to move my sore feet, stepping past the giant ridge. Mountains that couldn't be walked to the end, ah, you still need sore feet to finish walking them. I sat down in despair, then climbed up again, enduring the pain to step up. The more I climbed, the clearer I became, the distant journey of life that could not be walked to the end. If I couldn't bear the pain to climb past, then what?! In the silent valley, on the desolate giant ridge, I stumbled and scrambled upwards. With no tears, and a heart full of sadness and sorrow, I climbed along the ridge path all day long, and strode forward. Wandering traveler, when will you finish climbing this arduous journey!</p>
<h3>On the Lake</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>"To paint West Lake like Xi Zi is always fitting, whether lightly adorned or heavily made up." Of course, West Lake is always wearing beautiful clothes in all four seasons. But I always feel that the most beautiful West Lake is in autumn. The clear blue water, the maple leaves on the mountains, the weeping willows on the , the bright moon in the sky... All of these are beautiful. Autumn is a season of , emotion, and the West Lake in autumn is even more poetic and emotional!</p>
<p>The west wind leaked the news of autumn, and I began to miss West Lake. The autumn of West Lake, how nostalgic it is!</p>
<p>Autumn is clear and bright, the sky is high and the air is crisp, and the white clouds float in the sky like light smoke. Although the sun puts on a face to the world, it has no strength to be hot at all. Only the west wind is blowing vigorously, blowing the maple leaves on the mountains, blowing the weeping willows on the shore, and stirring up the ripples on the lake. I alone drive a flat boat, starting from Pinghu, passing through Santan, passing through Liulang, and passing through Su Causeway. It is truly. "Every ten steps I turn my head, there is a beautiful scene, each different when viewed horizontally or sideways!" As dusk approached, the sun had already hidden its face, and a gust of wind rose, and the rustling drizzle followed. Although the West Lake in the rain is as beautiful as a beauty wearing a light gauze, and it makes people linger and reluctant to leave. However, thinking of Yin who is far away in the South, I can't help but feel lost. I thought of Mo Ruo's poem "My love! Won't you come back..." and I thought of my Yin again; ah! The spirit of this autumn in West Lake is strumming my heartstrings.</p>
<p>The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and it was getting dark, so I brought the boat closer to the shore. Who knew that I inadvertently startled a pair of beautiful little birds from the willows and the withered lotus bushes, which made me regret it very much. The saying "scene touches feelings" began to slowly move in my heart. Finally, on this lake shrouded in misty rain, I couldn't help but sing this song:</p>
<p>The west wind rises suddenly,</p>
<p>The declining willows gently brush the water,</p>
<p>Startling a pair of kingfishers in the lotus bushes.</p>
<p>Tell the pair of kingfishers;</p>
<p>Don't be afraid,</p>
<p>Don't part;</p>
<p>Please buy another West Lake to get drunk.</p>
<h3>Two Centuries</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<h3>Strolling a Thousand Steps and Loitering on the Roads</h3>
<p>— Yunyi</p>
<p>There is an old Chinese saying, "A thousand steps after a meal," which is very healthy. When I was a child, as soon as I put down my rice bowl, my grandfather would force me to follow him to the veranda for "a thousand steps." My grandfather would hold his water pipe, looking so leisurely, and his "square steps" were very deliberate. Those swaying thousand steps were naturally effortless for him. However, a child couldn't do it. To keep pace with my grandfather with my hands hanging down, taking "a thousand steps" was a monumental task. Sometimes, when my grandfather wasn't paying attention, I would sneak away.</p>
<p>Foreigners also have this custom. They call it "strolling," which is more moderate. In the morning or evening, three or five friends, or a person holding their lover's arm, slowly stroll in the park or on quieter roads. This is more suitable for children; the reason is naturally the same: it's healthy.</p>
<p>I am now middle-aged. Although I don't have a water pipe to hold for "a thousand steps," I can assure you that I wouldn't "go AWOL." You think, to have a veranda for me to take a thousand steps after a meal, that kind of stable life is what I long for in my dreams. Even the more moderate "strolling" cannot emulate Western ways; naturally, the biggest reason is that I have no friends or lover.</p>
<p>Then, don't you want to be healthy? Who said that! I run around on the roads for several hours every day. However, there's no child following me with such ease, nor the suave and lively manner of holding a lover's arm. I walk alone from this road to that road, day and night, rain or shine, walking when I'm happy and stopping when I'm not. Although my attitude is similar to "a thousand steps" and "strolling," it cannot be confused with them; hence, it is named "Loitering on the Roads."</p>
<p>The name "Loitering on the Roads" certainly lacks the elegance of the former two, but it surpasses their original intent of "health." Don't believe it? Listen to me explain:</p>
<p>First, according to the "thousand steps" saying, it's nothing more than helping to digest the food that has been eaten. However, it's limited to "a thousand steps." If you eat a little less today, it's clearly not enough for digestion. Loitering on the roads has no limit. After a meal, it naturally continues until digestion is complete. Unfortunately, when one is hungry, it also completes the work of the next "thousand steps"—don't you understand? This means that the next time after a meal, you don't have to take "a thousand steps."</p>
<p>In terms of "strolling," three or five friends often have conflicting opinions, and arguments may occur on the road. It's not only unsightly, but also too contrary to the purpose of health to get angry over trivial matters. As for strolling with a lover, there are also many intangible losses. You only need to ask those "fallen" friends, and they can give you hours of "head-shaking" speeches to prove my point.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Loitering on the Roads" is paramount.</p>
<h3>### On the Road Toward Sunlight</h3>
<p>— Renying</p>
<p>Now, I deeply feel that the symptoms of neurasthenia are tightly gripping me!</p>
<p>After being sick for half a month, standing in front of the mirror, I recognize myself; I am different from before! A thin face, dull pupils, a twenty-year-old youth, his aging is gradually walking along a path contrary to health due to an irregular life.</p>
<p>In the summer, friends came to my place and saw my arms exposed outside my undershirt.</p>
<p>"You are still healthier!" I secretly felt happy. Although my body has gradually weakened over the past three or four years, among many friends, I still have something to be proud of!</p>
<p>The past life was really too irregular; the environment led me into the demonic path of insomnia. Now I stretch out my thin arms and shout inwardly, "I need health!"</p>
<p>Without a healthy body, there is a danger of leaving the track of life. I should change, towards the road of sunlight. Receiving the nourishment of its soft luster, like a beautiful flower of youth, bathing in its golden light!</p>
<p>Ending this nightlife, those things can destroy my health without anything remaining. Every day, when the morning sun crawls into my window, on the road in the suburbs, I welcome the peaceful sunlight! At that time, the air in Shanghai does not have the smell of gasoline, nor does it fly with coal ash from factories! Although the turbidity left over from the previous night in this metropolis still clashes in the space, it makes me miss the mornings in the village. But we cannot leave life, we who are deeply chained by the fetters of life!</p>
<p>I look forward to this work, not having a day of interruption for me. Health, come back? Still occupying my body and mind. Let us stretch out our thick arms and run towards the future of survival, without being restrained by the torment of illness.</p>
