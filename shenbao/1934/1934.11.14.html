<h3>為本報史總理致哀</h3>
<p>本報總理史量才先生。日昨自杭返滬。竟於中途被刺殞命。嗚呼慘矣。同人於倉猝之間。驚聞噩耗。緬懷往日。有不能詳於言而又不能已於言者。約略書之。以致哀詞。</p>
<p>量才先生少負長才。幼研新學。在當日帖括未廢之際。已治聲光化電之術。薄雕蟲之技而不為。此其思想之過人。有非凡近所能幾及者。國人茍能盡加師法。國家豈有不致認於富強。先生往矣。願持此說以示周行焉。</p>
<p>先生長應世務。名利之事。求之如拾芥。而先生不屑為之也。知國家之富強。在於民智之啟迪。則專意於與論事業。蓋惟與論能昌明。而後政治始可進於正軌。一切艱險。夷然處之。數十年來。未嘗少渝。至今本報得承社會之愛護。實先生有以發揚而光大之。蓋天下任事。非專不成。先生二十馀年。篤志於此。不僅為與論事業之成功。實且為社會上成功之標準。此種精神。實可佩紉。願與社會企業之士。共相持以為訓焉。</p>
<p>集人羣而成社會。以社會而有國家。故有志於國家者。當引社會之責任為已責。先生平居深念。有慨於斯。故無時無地。凡與社會有關係之事業。無不黽勉參加。期以進國家於郅治。不憚煩瑣。終於攖胃疾者十馀年。而仍復絲毫不懈。此其又可為國人之師法者一矣。</p>
<p>再有進者。先生日常涵養。輒以詩書相陶鎔。蓋惟養氣而後能勝繁劇。暇日以天君之泰然。行其心之所安。以進於學。以志於道。平日固無所忤於人。亦更引人之饑渴為已責。本來言理學者。不必拘於語錄之周祥。而在乎性靈之培養。先生可謂得其道者。治事如理亂絲。得暇自葆本能。此種人格上之修養。尤為同人久致其欽遲者。願特標舉。以為人倫之範。</p>
<p>凡此數端。固不能詳先生於萬一。而先生之學養。信在於斯。夫以先生之行誼。乃竟遭此橫禍。此實事理之最不可解者。黃鐘毀棄。哲人其萎。二十年來。風雨燈窗。得從役於先生者。聞此噩耗。有不愴然而神傷者乎。敢掬其誠以告讀</p>
<p>者。</p>

<h3>麥唐納切實否認英日秘密接洽說</h3>
<p>美方認此聲明澄清空氣</p>
<p>仍認海軍談判難免決裂</p>
<p>倫敦美國方面日來謠傅英日兩國一面從事海軍談話、一面從事極秘密之經濟與政治活動、日本關於［滿洲國］與日本之煤油案對英已作秘密讓步、日本紡織品之竸爭問題、刻正在考慮中云云、英相麥唐納今晚對此謠言、切實否認、謂英日代表間之一切經過、均隨時通告美代表、美英代表間之一切經過、亦隨時通告日代表、英日間秘密經濟政治活動一節、實無其事、英代表亦未被請秘密或以他法考慮關於［滿洲國］與日本煤油案之讓步提議、至英日兩國政府間之紡織業談判、已中止數月云、美國之海軍談判代表團謂、英相之聲明大有助於澄清空氣云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓美國海軍當局預料倫敦談話及明年之海軍會議皆將失敗、茲已著手籌備建造新艦之暫定計劃、美國官塲不信日本能接受英首相麥唐納所提出之妥協案、卽英美在原則上承認日本海軍平等、而日本以［紳士協定］式之聲明、限止海軍軍備、東京消息雖稱、日本官塲預料美國代表團將另有提案云、惟美聯社自可靠方面得悉、倫敦談判美代表團並無其他提議也、至於倫敦現方進行英日聯合反對美國海軍政策之說、美國官塲表示懷疑、此間消息靈通之官員表示、英國在太平洋商業範圍之廣大及東方政治及民族問題之繁複、皆使英日同盟之復活非常困難、現在倫敦方面之種種傳說、無非為英日代表欲以海軍談話決裂之責任使美國擔負、然談話之決裂固屬此間視為不可避免者也、（十二日國民電）</p>

<p>華盛頓衆院海軍委員會主席文生今日在聯邦航空調查委員會提議建造大飛艇二艘、以代已經毀壞之阿克朗號及洛杉機號、海軍部長史瑛生今日亦在該會力促增加海軍航空實力、海長並謂、增加巡邏飛機及陸上根據地之需要甚為迫切、故下屆國會應設法應付此種需要、史璜生及文生二氏皆反對海陸軍航空隊合併、另組航空部、二氏皆以為海軍與陸軍之需要逈異、故兩者合併實屬不智云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>海軍僵局英日明日再談</h3>
<p>日對英方妥協案</p>
<p>由山本另提對案</p>
<p>倫敦英美日間海軍談話沉寂之局面、可於一二日內打破之、英日代表大約將於星期四日會談、屆時將提出日政府對英國折衷提案之答覆、日方對於英國提案之見解會經過數次變遷、倫敦日人初視英國所提出於原則上承認日本海軍平等之建議、為確認日本之要求、繼經詳細研究、覺英國之建議、距日本之提案太遠、故料日政府必予駁絕、後又以為此種行動、實屬不智、現聞日政府之答覆、將另有提議、但目下衆信日本之答覆、將由日總代表山本提出、僅以其離日時所受之職權發言、又聞日政府不認英國建議充分美滿、而有自東京答復之必要、但為維持談話繼續並避免日本負破壞責任起見、山本將作外交性質之答覆、一面聲明此項答覆並非來自東京、衆信日本因考慮英國折衷提案費去之時間、乃故作姿勢、以期挫弱美國之忍耐性、而使美代表團受人譏刺而回國也、但據美方消息、美代表並不操切從事、茍任何談判尚在進行、則美代表不欲遽離此間也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>海軍談判即使失敗英美必須合作</h3>
<p>英國與論具體表示</p>
<p>倫敦前南菲聯邦總理史默治將軍在皇家國際問題研究會宴會席上發表演說、謂［外間時時謠傳戰事有立卽爆發之危險、須知此種傅說造成一種戰事空氣、其足以引起戰爭、實較任何事為甚也、］斯氏又謂、渠對時局情形頗表信任、渠意國際聯合會不當成為軍事性質之機構、無論何種企圖、欲將國聯變成一種以戰爭制止戰爭之制度、其失敗定可預卜、則以在此種情形之下、英國各自治領決不能繼續參加國聯、以牽入舊世界之戰爭也云云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦前南菲聯邦總理史默治將軍、昨日皇家國際問題研究會宴會席上發表演說、談及世界戰爭及國聯會問題已誌昨電、史氏演說尚有一段切中時弊、茲再補誌如下、其言曰、［不列顛帝國未來政策係以美國合作為基礎、以視其他國家合作尤關重要、本日泰晤士報著文加以評論、謂近來外間謠傅、英日兩國有重締同盟之說、致使美國方面大為震動、茲史默治將軍所言、實卽此項謠言最佳之更正、該報並謂、海軍談話卽使失敗、［吾國對美國友善協調之態度亦不宜予以拋棄、吾人循此而行、絕對不致錯誤］云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦今晨報紙載有英政府秘密招募退伍軍官遣往薩爾區域、俾於公民投票大會時增厚警察力量之說、致今日下院議員紛紛向英相麥唐納詰問此事、首相答稱、圖聯秘書長依照六月四日行政院所通過之議案、於九月三日通知各會員國、請對於薩爾管理委員會在薩爾區域外招募警察以增厚舉行公民大會時薩爾警力一事、予以便利　英國有若干退伍軍官上書自薦、英政府稍詢其資格與能力、如有無警政經騐及能否操法德兩種語言等點、然後將合格者之自薦書轉送薩爾管理委員會、此乃事實、至於外部或陸軍部秘密招兵一說、絕對不確云、首相繼答反對黨領袖藍斯堡之問、謂自請投効者如發生意外事項、英政府對之、自不負責、英政府不過因係會員國之一用特便利自薦者與薩爾管理委員會間之接洽耳、渠今日所知、各國退伍軍官向薩爾管理委員會之投効人數、僅有二十左右、此非為最近人數、查此二十人中、僅有二人係英籍、馀則為他國人云、據薩爾白魯根消息、薩爾管理委員會又請薩爾人民勿再從事爭辯、並聲稱、此後不許有［國賊］等字句、（十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>日本公債突破七萬萬元</h3>
<p>預算問題待首相解決</p>
<p>軍部強硬藤井屈服</p>
<p>東京大藏省決定之災害預算一億七千五百萬元、其財源將全部仰給赤字公債、故明年度赤字公債發行額　當然增加、若今后相當承認陸海軍等之復活要求額則公債發行額不免增大、附議於豫算閣議之明年度查定案、其公債發行額為六億四百萬元、合計災害預算之十年度分五千六百萬元、復活要求承認最小限度五千萬元、將突破七億元、則藤井藏相當初所力唱之減少公債發行額及恢復收支均衡之方針、已完全違背、故對藤井財政前途之悲觀說、近益有力、（十三日電通電）</p>
<p>東京政府對於明年預算、僅開一次閣議、　九日之定例閣議未致討論預算問題、而入陸軍大演習期、岡田首相以下各閣員均赴演習地、參觀演習、故中央各省與大藏省之交涉、由事務當局進行、林大角兩軍部大臣鑒於現下國際形勢、　堅持軍部預算實現方針、藤井藏相亦由財政當局之立塲、維持赤字公債漸減方針、其意見之衝突、須持岡田首相之解決、（十三日日聯電）</p>
<p>東京大藏省昨日開會之結果、承認災害預算一億七千五百萬元、比最初方針增加七千五百萬元、藤井藏相以增稅問題等得世問非難、將在臨時議會成為問題、故為回復信用起見、承認增大數目、藏相根基於減少赤字公債之方針、將農林內務兩省要求復活之農村土木費醫療救濟費等、列入災害預算內予以承認、災害預算昭和九年份為七千萬元、十年份為五千五百萬元、表面上雖有減少傾向、然此不過為名義上之減少、實際財政並不以此種辦法、強化其內容、且藤井財相對於軍部之強硬態度、表示屈服態度、其所謂健全的財政方針毫無效果、（十三日日聯電）</p>

<p>西北視察記</p>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>從敦煌農村經濟說到各縣撥欵制度</p>
<p>敦煌為漢河西四郡之一、領縣六、敦煌卽郡之首邑、命名敦煌、原有［大盛］之義、後以其地有嗚沙山、或稱沙州、明嘉靖初、為吐蕃所擾、民皆內徒、清雍正時、復遷內地之民以實之、城憑黨河東岸、周六百丈、高一丈九尺、前陽關而後玉門、控伊吾而制漠北、蓋全隴之咽喉、極邊之鎖鑰也、</p>
<p>彊域界至甜水井、一百四十里、西至新疆邊界、一千九百里、南至阿魯柴旦、接連蒙古遊牧地、五百七十里、北至哈密界、四百數十里、面積約三十萬方里、（向無精確統計、據縣府調查、至少當在十八萬方里以上、）全縣已耕田地、為十一萬六千九百四十畝、尚可開懇之荒地、約在五萬畝以上、缺水戈壁未計在內、戶口現有二千三百馀戶、人數約二萬馀、內農民占一千八百五十戶、計一萬八千人、地主佔全農戶百分之五十五、自耕農占有百分之十、半自耕農占百分之十五、佃僱農占百分之二十、平均現有人口及耕地、每人約可分田六七畝、平年產糧、年約千馀石、民食已漸感不敷</p>
<p>農戶多於清雍正年間自甘肅各縣遷來、每戶給地一分、約五十畝至六十畝、故今之稱田地者不曰一分、卽曰一戶、至云五厘地或二厘半地、則各約占地二十五畝或十二三畝、民元全縣田地、共有十一萬七千一百五十九畝、至今荒蕪不耕者、有二千八百十二畝、其荒蕪原因、一黨河水發、沖沒三百馀畝、二絕戶、無人耕種、三逃戶、因兵匪俶擾、差徭繁重、全家避往新疆、近五年絡繹不絕、四壯年農人、多被拉去當兵　亦為近五年之事、</p>
<p>濟乾嘉時、商號林立、地方原甚富庶、此因當時金鑛發逹、淘金者數逹五千以上、年收課金、約近四百兩、以後則逐漸減少、民國以來、鑛業大衰、蓋人民多趨於種煙一途也、種煙者多、吸者亦多、愈吸愈懶、愈懶愈貧、近年更因兵匪關係、農民負擔加重、農村經濟日益破產、遂致七十二道金溝全部豊富之金鑛、無人囑問、去年楊燦（宜興人、在蘭州任教多年、頗著聲譽、）來宰斯邑、下車後首倡振興金鑛、借民口糧、勸往淘金者、約有四五十人、惟據金夫所稱、彼等極怕軍人、強收課金、故多不敢去、金溝接近青海邊界、去年青省方面曾派軍人多名、前往查收金課、雖不多收、但金夫終存長心、仍難望其與旺也、</p>
<p>甘省客軍林立、供給維艱、迫不得已、始任民種煙、征收罰欵、以充軍費、每屆春初、煙未下種、卽收煙欵、縣府未雨綢繆、更不得不預為攤派、此項煙欵、向由禁煙會及財政廰、分攤各縣、將數目送往綏靖公署、分配各軍隊、直接派員、分赴各縣提取、軍需萬急、刻不容緩、縣長卽向各區攤收交提、中上之家、尚可繳納、貧寒之戶、無法應付、只得轉向富戶商人哀求借貨、不說利息幾分、只說支土幾兩、普通借洋一元、至收新煙時、少則支土六兩、多則八兩、不論煙價高低、務須兩數稱足、每畝種煙產量、平均不足五十兩、而攤欵在十元以上、外加工資四五元、共計十七八元、而煙價每百兩只售三十元、是每畝之收入、只值十五元、自有資本尚須賠本二三元、最幸運之煙戶、（如收成獨豊售價較高）亦僅可敷本、若借錢還煙、每畝且只獲七八元、約夠所納煙欵及所耗工本之半數、從此愈拖愈累、愈負愈重、生活惡劣、遂不堪問、</p>
<p>省府所撥軍費、按月不斷、煙苗未盈尺、畝欵已撥盡、月月撥欵、日日催征、縣長及各區鄉長無時不為催欵忙、農民更無時不為交欵急、政事廢馳、農作失時、農村經濟破產、胥由於此、縣府因農戶困苦　春季借洋一元、至夏季還土七八兩、不堪負累、曾呈請禁煙會在空月少撥軍費、至七八月間、再行補撥、庶免農戶拖累、藉恤民艱、無奈軍費緊急、省方礙難照準、因之多數農戶、仍須早日借債交欵、至收煙時、債主麕集田畔、持秤索債、或竟搶收煙漿、以致爭鬥時聞、詞訟迭起、如此情形、各縣長尚何暇言及農村救濟地方建設耶、</p>
<p>查甘省撥欵制度、始於民國十九年、各縣各局之收入、大都分由各軍隊直接提取、往往超過額數、縣局無法應付、呈請改撥不準、提欵人更藉為口實、多方與縣局為難、縣局不得已、曾向省方請示、以欵已超撥、如何籌措、省方亦無法解決、多置不理、且提欵人來往車價、以及其他供應、均須地方擔負、數屬不貲　記者前在蘭州訪晤朱主席時、曾聞朱氏有取消撥欵之擬議、是撥欵制度之不良、早在當局明察之中、今經各地實際考察、果覺此制若再延長、卽民間痛苦加深一日、亟盼甘省財政幸如朱氏所期、迅得中央協助、一律統收統支、庶撥欵制度早日廢除、縣局得免焦頭爛額、不僅編氓可稍蘇喘息也、</p>

<h3>特載中國憲法的幾個根本問題（續）立法院長孫哲生先生講</h3>
<p>— 范世勤速記。</p>
<p>（四）人民的權利義務　憲法草案中要解決的一個基本問題、即是人民權利與義務、憲法是根本的大法、人民權利義務自應有相當的規定、但這種規定、卻不能有詳細的、只能在原則上來規定、</p>
<p>在憲法草案中、人民的權利與義務　是用一種間接的方法規定、固然最好的憲法、是把人民的權利、一條一條很詳細地規定起來、不過那是一種理想、在原則上可以接受、在事實上是有相當的研究　為什麼呢、因為這種規定、是不容易的、人民自由權利種類很多、要是現在時候、便把他永遠規定起來、以及不能出這個範圍、那是不容易的、第二個困難、人民的自由權利、既規定得太詳細了、太固定了、那於將來的憲法頒布後、運用的時候、使國家要發生一種困難、這話是怎樣說法呢、因為我們的憲法與每一個國民、都有相當的關係、予人民以相當的保障、同時我們的國家、是全國民族所造成的國家、所謂individua、尤其是在現在、民族的地位非常重要、如果人民自由權利充分的發展、到一個相當的時候、恐怕要妨礙到國家的自由、危害國家的自由、因為注重個人來犧牲國家、犧牲民族、是不成功的、現在的地位、是想法找民族國家的出路、不是一個一個人去謀出路的、事實上這樣是做不到、而且不能普遍的、如果個人的自由權利同國家衝突了、寗願犧牲個人的自由權利來保存國家的、根據這個規定、所以憲法草案對人民自由權利、祇予以間接的保障、</p>
<p>現在、在這樣方式之下人民有居住。集會。通信。等等的自由　但有非以法律不得限制的條文規定著、國家可以根據法律來限制人民的自由權利、我們在這個憲法草案初稿發表時、外面對於這點很有反對的意思、他們主張人民的自由、應由直接保障、才得充分發展、其實這種反對間接保障、無論舉什麼例來都是欠缺的、不能動搖的、厝如說軍人妨礙人民的自由權利、這舉動在中國到處都有、他們是不根據法律、只是一味摧殘人民的自由權利、這是中國沒有憲法的緣故、也就是沒有成為法治國的緣故一個軍人所以隨便下命令來捕人、人民所以會有這種痛苦、因為是沒有憲法保障的關係、</p>
<p>國民政府成立以後、對於法律、是有一種標準、就是所有法律要經過立法院的議決、在現在雖然這個原則、還沒有完全逹到、過去有許多軍人、他們的命令威力、是超過法律、甚至軍人隨便立法、沒有經過立法機關通過、這種以命令來替代或變更法律、人民受著這種痛苦、不是因為有法律才受到的、法律的成立、必需經過立法機關通過、立法機關、就是代表人民的機關、議決了一件法律、不能違背了人民的要求、人民在這種情形之下、可以說已經有了保障、現在我們的憲法、條文中雖有限制人民的自由權利規定、但必需依據著法律　這是我們所根據的原則、</p>
<p>（五）政權與治權的劃分　現在的憲法、是以五權憲法為標準、為根據、來規定國家的組織的、五權憲法中劃分政權與治權兩部份、這在研究政治學的人、是從來沒有聽到的、而一般理論、對政權與治權、總是分不清楚的、我們這種劃分、實在是一種新的方法、政府的權力是治權、人民的權力是政權、政府是由人民產生、普通的國家產生的方式、是一種投票法、即是所謂選舉、譬如美國的大總統是由人民投票選舉的、以及政府的產生、都由人民選舉出來的、不過我們是要把他補充起來、比如美國前一任總統是胡佛、但是人民在幾年前已經有不滿意他的了、責備他很厲害、但是對胡佛仍是沒有辦法、因為一定要等他滿任、才能再來重選、美國總統的改選、是四年一次、胡佛在這一次、也是候選、但是人民多投票羅斯福、胡佛便落選了、人民不信任總統、然而一定也要在他任滿以後、總不能使他在任的時期中下任、所以人民在必要的時候、或者有一種要求、覺得總統不行、可以用一種罷免的方法、對於選舉權之外、再有罷免權、那就是一個補充、人民單單有選舉權是不夠的、還得要有罷免權、而且除此以外、還應有創制權、比方立法院是代表人民的機關、即是一種國會、受人民的委託、通過法規、政府的種種政策、應該經立法院的通過、可是人民也應有立法律的權、人民如有一種要求、一種政策、假如議會不給他議決、這種情形、在美國人民就沒有辦法、像美國前幾年禁酒時期、人民已經覺得不行、可是人民沒有辦法把牠改變、來取消這個禁酒的法令、雖然經過了多年的運動、才逹到了目的、可是人民總不能直接舉動、一定要等到國會的通過、差不多這樣等了幾年、法律才得更變、所以這裹就覺得要有創制權、能夠實行創制權、人民就可以用創制權、直接提出來、不必定要立法院的同意、反之、以後如大家的意見又變更了、還可以再運用一種複決權、來重新推翻前案的、以上四種、即是政權、政權不是政府替人民來行、是人民自己使用的、人民如要運用政權、政府是不能反抗或干涉的、</p>
<p>除了政權、便是治權、政府替人民行使的是有五權、即是行政。立法。司法。考試。監察。國民政府有運五種治權來行使。那是代表人民來行使的、只受人民的委托、政府與人民兩方面、是很清楚　政府所行使的是五權、人民所行使的是四權、中國有四萬萬人民、事實上不能裹在一處、天天討論國家的事情、所以人民只好選舉政府出來、代人民做事、同時人民又可以罷免官吏、至於法律、立法院是代替人民議決的、但人民仍舊有創制和複決的權、總之、政府的五院、只是行使五權憲法中的治權、（未完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求寒工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>賈多才笑著拱拱手道：那麼、恭喜郭先生一定是飽載而歸的了。郭敦品笑道：飽載兩個字，那裹談得上，不過混了兩年，把幾年來的虧空，填補過去了。我本來想回江蘇去的，到了西安許多朋友拉扯著，總說有機會，因之我也就耽擱下來了。果然是有機會的話呢，我就不回江蘇去了。剛才我和士廉兄說的善後捐，也是我想經營的一件事，不過兄弟手邊沒有現錢，已經寫信回家，設法籌備去了。假如錢到了，我要相當的活動一下。現在士廉兄來了，我也勸他走這一條路子。李士廉笑著搖了兩搖頭道：這是你老哥知二五不知一十的話了。你老哥在西北多年的人，還不能活動，我怎麼行？郭敦品正色道：我當然不必說假話，無客氣，照著我在西北這兩年的成績說起來，我自然可以找點路子。不過空口說白話，那總是不行的，這個年頭，少了這東西，人活躍不起來的。說著，他將食指和姆指，比了一個圈圈，讓大家來看。李士廉笑道：那我更不行了。賈多才當他們說話之時，只在一邊，用冷眼看著，讓他們談了半天的話，才插言道：有這樣些個困難嗎？要多少錢才可以夠活動的呢？郭敦品道：這自然不能一定，但是無念經作什麼事，活動費當然是越多越好。賈多才又沉吟了半響，微笑道：假如我要改行斡這一件事，二位可能替我助一臂之力呢？郭敦品微閉了眼睛，連身子帶腦袋，幌盪了有七八下，笑道：成功不必自我。假如賈先生有這意思，我們可以絕對的幫忙（六三）</p>
<h3>柯亭</h3>
<p>— 馬佛生</p>
<p>說起柯亭，大該總有幾人曉得的。我還隱約記得十一歲的那年，在柯亭小學裹讀書，那時有個沈先生，他是小學裹的　美術教師，他和我感情很好，某天，他用梯子爬上柯亭去書風景書，我也跟了上去，（因為亭年久失修，上去很危險，那時恐怕學生們摔下來，所以扶梯已經沒有了。）上面有二個牌位，一個當然是蔡伯喈先生，還有一個就是胡道南先生，號鍾生；（道南先生也是革命鉅子。）</p>
<p>柯亭本來是一間草屋，但它的椽子是用竹做的，那時蔡先生路過這柯亭，在柯亭裹息了一夜，柯亭的竹椽，被黃蜂咬了許多洞，風吹入洞內，嗚嗚作聲。蔡先生聽了這聲音，很覺新奇，後來他就根據這椽竹的風聲，作了一種橫笛。（俗稱柯亭之竹，可以為笛；這當然是誤解的。）</p>
<p>民國初年，胡道南先生遇難，地方人士以胡先生有功紹興，故設一胡先生靈位於柯亭，所以這柯亭就有了兩個主人翁。</p>
<p>至於柯亭的風景，也很不差，環亭三面清流，亭獨立湖中，四面皆山，不遠不近，望去恰像蒼翠色的綠帶子，繞著柯亭，亭旁有廣塲，四圍樹以綠柳，每到春天，綠陰如幄，所在二三月間遊人不絕。</p>
<p>上面柯亭的來歷，係根據亭前石碑，當然不致於錯誤的。</p>
<p>末了，還有蔡伯喈先生死後，柯亭就改為蔡先生祠，這知道的人很少，所以也把它寫在上面。（上面也根據石碑）</p>

<p>預言是一種最幽默的事：譬如今年流行的新裝，是一九三五式；若有人預言明年一九三六式世界最盛行的裝束，那一定是荷搶實彈，巔巍巍的軍裝！</p>
<p>Ｃ君的女友于歸大喜，他的心頭像潑翻了五味罐，說不出是甚麼味兒。伊的母親還巴巴的來邀吃喜酒，可是Ｃ君怎忍下咽，祇得諉說近來身體欠安，時常［心痛。］</p>
<h3>襪</h3>
<p>— 沙永采</p>
<p>襪，誰都公認是一件日常衣著中的必需品。但當寒暑表向高處進展到八九十度，摩登姑娘們開始裸腿的時候，它是和她們的玉腿脫離關係的，待到秋風一起，時令一變，它方才能重整旗鼓的在她們六寸圓膚上活躍。</p>
<p>在從前海禁未開之前，我國是祇盛行布襪，在那時候，假使你穿了一雙雪白的竹布襪，和一雙杜製的厚底鞋，那是已經夠了漂亮了。然而自中外通商以後，布襪的勢力是被洋襪打倒了，於是洋襪洋襪的聲浪，在那時是形成最時髦的口頭禪。直到現在，雖然襪是大多數已由我國工廠自製，並非都向外洋販來，而［洋襪］的稱呼，卻仍舊流傅在一部份人的嘴邊。</p>
<p>世界文明愈進步，人們的物質享受也愈奢侈，這是一個無庸否認的事實。就以襪而論:都市裹的姑娘們，一襪之微，往往要化費到五六元至十多元不等，這和從前的一雙布襪相比，相去何啻千倍！無怪一般窮措大要聞之咋舌，高唱著［姑娘一雙襪，窮漢半年糧］了。</p>
<p>有一位朋友告訴我，據說：［浙江諸暨地方的土人，有一種特製的髪襪，是拿頭髪編織而成的。因為頭髪是光緻而堅軔，所以著之可經十數年不破，並且也不用時常洗滌云云。］你看！這種襪是多麼合乎經濟原則，而又多麼的經穿耐用，真是一件土製用品中的傑出品。</p>
<p>東隣大和民族，生存在現世紀，仍舊保留著布襪的風光。他們這種守舊性，固然不足為我們効法，而他們這種精神，去值得我們讚歎佩服的。</p>

<h3>蘇垣菊展記</h3>
<p>— 菊痴</p>
<p>西風冷落葉黃楓丹之候。吳王臺畔一年一度之菊花金魚展覧會，已於十一月九日起在分園舉行。佳菊名魚，羅列滿陳，全城士女，往觀者裙屐絡繹，衣香　影，備極熱鬧。深秋寂寞之公園，復呈初夏時之裔旎風光，菊花種類繁多，其狀不一，或濃艷欲滴，或淡雅宜人；或花瓣卷曲；或隨態舒展；令人留戀俳佪，為之欣賞不盡。其中售品以癸酉藝植社紫羅蘭盆及公園培植者為最翠林巧色，悉維揚老種，泃屬不易多觀之品。陳列金魚之室，觀者更為擁擠，以紫羅裝盆之五彩蛋鳳魚，鬬魚及泗井巷孫之各色珍珠魚，為最特色，五彩繽紛，　　作舞，粒粒珍珠，粗密分明，令人悠然作魚樂之想。室隅尚有癸酉社之古玩擺件，陳列滿幾，中有盆栽芭蕉瓜果清供，及古銅魚池，中植玉竹，儲水畜魚其間，清幽宜人，極盡藝術之能事，濡筆為記，以誌鴻爪。（卻酬）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲録</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>右面的一間是專供太后作為私人的佛殿的，太后生性很崇奉佛教，伊有一尊磁製的觀音像，差不多是終年不斷地虔誠供奉著的，此刻已早就派人賚到這裹來了，有時候伊也歡喜念念經，所以必須另外有這麼一間靜室；便殿的右邊一間，就是太后的寢室。</p>
<p>在那便殿的中央，就是我們一進去，最先走到的正中的那一間屋子裹，有一張不很高的小圓桌子；這桌子的本身原沒有什麼值得令人特別法意的地方，但它的上面，卻有一副太后日常所愛用的骨牌安著。這副骨牌當太后沒有起程之前，原是藏在頣和園內的某一座便殿裹的；起程的前一天，我們還瞧見它好好地放在那裹藏著咧，後來也不曾聽見太后吩咐過要把它帶上奉天來。但李連英和張德這幾個大太監的心思，原是最靈巧不過的，他們以為太后到了奉天，說不定會有突然想起這副骨牌的可能，因此就暗地裹派人帶來了，我們卻不曾知道。所以大家一走進去，就把視綫齊集中在這副牌的上面；太后似乎也覺得很詫異，但伊也知道這是伊的奴才們先意奉承的一番美意。</p>
<p>靠近那通連寢室的門的旁邊，另有一張很闊大的桌子，這使是太后的公事桌了。上面已很整齊地安著一副筆硯，和其他應用的文具，如印泥，水盂等等，和許多式樣不同的紙張。（一七三）</p>
<h3>杮與香蕉</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>（一）柿</p>
<p>杮爛然殷紅，甘美可啖，予殊嗜之，葉如山茶而厚大，夏至時開微黃花，及秋結實，經二寸許，色青綠，摘而藏之，數日後即紅熟可喜，彷佛番茄。藏杮之法，最好與木瓜或檳榔雜置，可免味澀。產青州者更佳，我吳山中亦多是物，巨者曰銅盆杮，小者曰金缽盂，取其形似也。</p>
<p>古云：［杮有七絕，一樹多壽，二葉多蔭，三無鳥巢，四少蟲蠧，五霜葉可玩，六嘉賓可餐，七落葉肥厚。］爾雅翼及西陽雜俎俱載之。</p>
<p>昔鄭虔任廣文博士，學書而病無紙，知慈恩寺布杮葉數間屋，遂借僧房居止，日取紅葉學書，歲久殆遍，藝苑佳話，足以千秋。</p>
<p>杮樹接果根凡三次，則結實無核，朶頣大快。</p>
<p>以杮之大者。去皮壓扁，晝夜暴露，乾則納諸裹中，待生白霜取出，味極甜美，曰杮餅。食之可以愈痔，與無花果同。</p>
<p>杮與蟹不可同進，進則毒致人病。故陳蘊朱杮詩，亦有蟹　微有忌之句。</p>
<p>別有一種椑杮，葉上有毛，實青黑而奇澀，擣取其汁，俗稱杮漆，塗於紙傘扁骨上，有禦濕防腐之功。</p>
<p>飯牛翁牧牛庵筆記，載有四杮亭一則云：［崑山縣千墩鄉，僻小市集也。顧亭林先生誕生於此，先生讀書處，手植四杮樹，三百年來，根株已毀。宣統辛亥，廣東梁節庵太史鼎芬，事至千墩。出已資，重建忠孝祠，補種四杮於庭，鐫石碑，嵌於壁。余於乙丑秋專誠拜謁祠堂，瀏覧瞻仰，感慨靡已。］</p>
<p>王西神前輩，亦嗜杮甚，於其所作湖上秋痕詩中，曾道及之，詩云：［湖山美著水雲鄉，短艇瓜皮盪夕陽，一片秋光描不盡，青菱紅杮桂花黃。註云：［行裝甫卸，即售小舟，作泛湖之游。瓶花列幾，鼻觀香濃，堆案陳列時果，湖中鮮菱，活翠嫩香，不啻雞頭軟剝。杮寫杭之名產，有南山杮北山栗之稱。余有䁑病，夙嗜此物，紅酣綠潤，相映增妍，洪北江秋日泛舟白雲谿詩序，所紀情景彷彿遇之，］佳果獲此褒語，益覺聲價十倍。</p>
<p>杮有凌霜候之號，見在田綠云：［高皇微時，過剩柴村，霜杮正熟，上取食之後，道經此樹，下馬以赤袍加之，曰對爾為凌霜長者。或曰凌霜候］，然則杮亦帝制遺孽歟一笑。</p>
<p>（二）香蕉</p>
<p>香蕉為熱地所產。芭蕉所結之實也，葉甚大，花淡黃色，實長四五寸，徑寸許，彼此鱗接，香而味甘，又稱甘蕉。暹雜之大香蕉，長尺許，肥碩無朋，啖一枚可使人飽。故日得二三午蕉，可含哺而煕，鼓腹而游，赫胥氏之民不啻矣。</p>
<p>香蕉潤腸開胃，故汽水果子露中，冰結凝中，和入其液少許，飲之殊可口也。</p>
<p>粵人家有所謂香蕉飯者，擇上好香蕉，剝去其皮，置石臼內，用杵搗爛，取糯米和豬油人大碗中，蒸熟，外加龍眼肉等，勝於肴館中人八寶飯也。</p>
<p>同社范煙橋兄，曾述香蕉與酒事，絕有極：［陳佩忍先生於某年至厓山，訪故宋遺蹟，殘山剩水，一片蒼茫。訽諸土人，謂山上有國母祠，蓋祀楊太后也。既登，欲得杯酒以祭，出變銀毫予同事，命沾酒來。司事為粵人，誤酒為蕉，越時負巨株至，累累滿穗，皆香蕉也。乃笑而與司事分食之。後為孫中山先生所聞，每與佩忍先生共酒食，必以此相嘲云。］</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於現實主義</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>近來，現實主義復興的高潮，席捲了各國的文壇，這高潮的泛起是連緊著遺產的承收和自然主義作家的形式。學習問題。原來各國文壇一致認為莎士比亞，巴爾扎克，左拉等的現實主義作家，他們的遺產，是有承受價值的。因為他們都忠實地反映了現實，毫不彎曲，好像曼羅蘭說：［藝術家的藝術，是而鏡子，將現實社會如實的反映出來。］</p>
<p>實際說來，藝術家的藝術，的確是面鏡子，可是我覺得這面鏡子，必須被藝術家所具有進步的世界觀所磨鋉過的不可，單單地像面鏡子，那就成了英國大小說家傑姆斯。喬易斯（joyce,james）的現實主義了。</p>
<p>在日本以及我國，把現實主義作家的遺產，都囫圇地咽下的現象是有的，尤其對於現實主義的理解，認為祇反映現實就做得夠資格了，學巴爾扎克，莎士比亞等的整過方法：其實這不能說是最下劣的方法，因為由這方法所成全的藝術，只不過暴露了市民的荒淫，但總不能成為最適應目前社會的最好的方法。</p>
<p>我曾在日本與北平的雜誌或報上，看到了學習巴爾扎克的提倡，在表面上看來，讓作家學習我們最大的現實主義作家，是對的，但實際是不很適當的。</p>
<p>巴爾扎克的偉大，不僅僅是由於他忠實的反映現實，不僅僅是由於他取理現實的素材，他的偉大性，是在於他能把歷史的使命，歷史的進行，很顯明地告訴給讀者了，在他的作品裹有貴族階級的沒落與新資產階級的抬頭之劃時代的歷史賦命在。我們學習巴爾扎克的現實主義方法，的確是可以的，但能學得到他在藝術裹所賦的歷史使命麼。我們的現實主義，必須建立在我們的新的世界觀上。</p>
<p>不僅僅如此，有些藝術家，把現實主義看成了止前創作方法的最好的一個，而把藝術上存在的政治性，完全給格殺殆盡，像日本的雜誌［現實］為中心的諸作家，如龜井勝一郎，川口浩等就是這主張的奉行者；我相信這結果能造成了忠實於現實的藝術，然而缺少了內在的進步的世界觀，這不會打動讀者的心，並且也不曾盡了藝術家對現世界所負的任務。像這一派的現實主義，我又得舉喬易斯來說明吧！</p>
<p>喬易斯的藝術很忠實地描寫了愛爾蘭的小市民，他跟隨主人公到事務所測窺，並且跟隨他到學校，酒排間，娼窰，觀測主人公的運動，思惟，感覺，以及於從胃的運動到腦於性慾的狀態。於是他毫無遺漏地，把這順序地敘述起來。然而由於這所完成的藝術，就成了最高的水準的藝術了嗎？不，他一點也沒有完成了藝術家的任務，並且是不很完全的作品。因為這由於他不曾給與人生的全體性。他有一篇描寫愛爾蘭的小市民對他所恨的主權，在一九一六年起來了反亂的小說；在這小說的人物布里由姆與綏拉梯斯等的人們，在巴里凱得都被射殺了。但是他真的把人生之真的姿態，如電影地描寫了出來嗎？沒有，因為他的電影的描寫之對象的取捨，是被他的見地所規定的，他雖然撰擇了小市民的無價值性與持有特徵的諸契機，但看不到在門爭中的他們。他的這種方法不是呌做人生表現的祈客觀的方法，單單地是看不到從文化的危機裹的活路，從小市民的見地裹出發的人生諸現象的取捨。</p>
<p>最近蘇聯，卡爾。拉弟克中對於喬易斯的現實主義，曾說了些中肯的話：</p>
<p>［喬易斯所持的藝術家任務，是用顯微鏡檢閱　塊，然後用照像機給映寫出來。喬易斯他相信將各種各樣的運動，思想的活動，人間的活動，靠著用照相機而描出來時，就完成了表現現實的真面，並且他以為把這組成全體時，就能呈現出大的展開圖。</p>
<p>我得大聲呼嚷，請諸作家不要學這種現實主義。］</p>
<p>的確，喬易斯的現實主義，祇是檢　工作，沒有歷史使命，然而我們的現實主義，究意應該怎樣地取理呢？我在上面說過，藝術家不僅應以現實主義來反映藝術，並且應該從自己的世界觀中透濾過來。所以我們對於現實主義的態度，是反對檢糞的工作的。</p>
<p>十一月於東京</p>
<h3>十三灘</h3>
<p>— 胡天宇</p>
<p>［明天要過十三灘了。］</p>
<p>這是一個風雪的晚上，我們預備睡覺的時候，三個水手對我們說的話。船，是隻破舊的烏篷船。那船篷已經破得不成樣子了，風挾著雪花從裂縫鑽進來，空氣似乎比外面更冷。地方又小，幾個人擠在一處，你想動一動就感到礙手礙腳的難過。有個伙伴就曾嘆過氣：</p>
<p>［坐這樣的船真是受罪！］</p>
<p>打上船那天起，天就變得這樣壞；雪大大的飄著，沒停過。天氣冷得要死，河裹有些地方都結了冰。我們整天整夜的躲在艙裹，連船頭上都不敢去望一下。船篷又是這麼低，坐起來就頂著篷子，仲腰簡直連想一下都是太多事。可是，這樣的日子，我們已經過了兩天兩夜的時日子呵，像做夢似地。</p>
<p>還是在夢裹呢，我們就聽見［杭育杭育］的聲音了。這聲音和我們是生疏的，因為我們走了兩天的水程，除了時常聽得見風聲呼號以外，沒聽見別的聲音。今天突起的這一片［杭育杭育］，便使得我們都十分驚異起來。</p>
<p>幸而雪晴了，我們得到船頭上去眺望。原來我們已經到了第一灘了。這灘太高，上面水淺，下面水深，船無論如何都劃不過去的；一定要人把牠抬起來，推送到下灘去。那［杭育杭育］的聲音，就是十幾個水手在水裹抬起第一隻船下灘去時的號呌。</p>
<p>他們都站在水裹，褲腳管捲得很高，上身都還是穿著破棉襖。大家都把背緊貼船身，兩隻手扳著船邊，每張嘴都整齊的喊出－－</p>
<p>［杭育啊唉－哎……］</p>
<p>於是船身很呆笨的向前移動了一下。</p>
<p>唉！這是什麼玩意兒呢？這冷的天，他們在水裹不怕冷嗎？我想去問我們船上的水手，但他們不見了；後來才在那水裹的一羣中找到了他們兩個。</p>
<p>便又聯想起來：我們這班一共七隻船，原是一個船行裹的。他們都是同行的夥計，他們原有互相幫助的義務的。</p>
<p>這樣的，他們抬過了第一隻船，又抬第二，第三隻船…。</p>
<p>七隻船齊抬完了，水手們才各自爬到船上來。我們的那兩個也來了：我見他們的腿浸得熟銅似的，但額上卻淌著汗。</p>
<p>［這生活真不是人斡的呀！］</p>
<p>他們搖搖腦袋說，太息似地船又很平安地開行了。用棉被裹著身子，這天氣太冷了啦！</p>
<p>最多只走得半里路，我們的耳邊又騰起了宏大湍激的灘聲。這還是第二個灘呢。我應瞧船頭上的水手；他們默然的對望着。</p>
<p>到將近灘邊，他們又跳下水抬船去了。</p>
<p>這樣的，他們抬了一隻船又抬一隻船，過了一個灘又過一個灘。</p>
<p>十三灘終於完全渡過了，那已是黃昏時候。水手們才崧過一口氣來，像成功了一件奇嘖那麼地，一面燒著晚飯，一面唱起山歌來了。</p>
<p>那聲音落在黃昏的河面上，顫抖，凄涼，抑　，我們都被牠喚起無限的哀愁來，卻是那麼輕輕地，悄悄地。</p>
<h3>韓盛家窰子的夜（下）</h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>頂上盤著圈瓣子的趕車的該是才解了溲，咬著根褲帶在門外褶褲子：［沒吃的嗎？先生們都是講道理的學生，不吃虧你的。大哥！］</p>
<p>［真的沒呢，你大哥我還愛撒謊？］說話的［中年］男子，抬頭對趕馬車的硬硬裂開嘴笑笑。他的笑到是還年輕些的，可是在歛了笑之後，便顯得更老的樣子。這早衰的年青人，隔了不久又無聲地乾笑子。那種笑的意味和動機是完全難捉摸的。當他被摧促著到村上去借吃的時候，他在油燈側茫然的又掛一絲笑－顯然是非凡的陰森。</p>
<p>有人發覺這屋裹還是十三個人：在女人的身旁，一個孩子縮在羊毛皮裹邊。他大概才驚醒，把頭打娘背後伸出來。含糊的呌著。</p>
<p>［媽！］揉揉眼。</p>
<p>［別鬧！］</p>
<p>孩子撲在坑上，用兩肘支撐起頭部和胸部，惺昖的，不住驚奇的打量著這許多客。</p>
<p>［生火呀！］老頭子吩咐著。</p>
<p>屋裹的人都懶得作聲，互相打著呵吹，淚汪汪的。女人蹲在地上，刻板的生著火，人們懶散的應著她－直呆到水都在鍋裹沸騰的時候。</p>
<p>［怎麼一回事呀，老爹！還沒回來……］</p>
<p>過了一些時候，出去的人才空著手出現在門口了。</p>
<p>［怎麼－沒嗎？］</p>
<p>［是呀！］</p>
<p>［怎麼－一點都沒？］矮個子的護兵睜大眼不信的問著。勃子都因之增長了許多。</p>
<p>［呃，全村有的還不夠你先生們一頓喫！沒法嘞，老總！］</p>
<p>人們反而楞默住了。直等到那大個子的趕車的自告奮勇，騎上光背馬，到七八里路外去找吃－蹄聲消失之後，才互相嗟歎起來。</p>
<p>［常有的事，］老頭子冷靜的說：［從前也還有人要裝窮，現在大家都可以打開門睡覺了。要搶未，只有二張坑……］</p>
<p>兩個護兵笑了。在煙霧裹塌鼻子的那個又摸摸他身側的盒子。</p>
<p>寂寞的倚撐在坑上喝著水，抽著煙，靜等著馬蹄的響聲。彼此的談話常給類似馬蹄的錯覺所驟上。直到趕車的真的揣著吃的進來了，才完全穩定下心來。</p>
<p>不久，一頓對大家需要極急迫的晚餐，在唯一的鐵鍋裹冒白煙了，裹面混雜的沸騰著小米，南瓜，和地瓜。</p>
<p>［好香的！］老頭子俯坐在坑上，搓著手，不住食婪的嗅著，打量著。那孩子也完全坐起來了。倚在娘的肩旁，眼珠烏光的擱在那鍋食物裹面：</p>
<p>［我們也有吃的嗎？媽！］</p>
<p>女人輕輕的吆喝著，接著又把嘴擺在她孩子的耳旁，蠍蠍的低語了一陣。</p>
<p>趕車的呆　著那灶邊的火光，忽然像在夢裹邊猛的給驚醒般的，問女人要鹹鹽了。</p>
<p>［沒咧…］</p>
<p>沒，晚餐還是同樣的開始了。為了碗的緣故，有七個人，只能等在一邊，嚵涎的咽著口水，不好意思的把眼珠子亂藏亂擱。</p>
<p>［唉，真淡得要命。醬油也沒有吧？］學生問。用左手拿下給熱氣薰糢糊的眼鏡。</p>
<p>［一年多嘞－在去年過年，也沒買過醬油吶，先生！…］感到默著看吃難堪的老頭子，乘了這機會，大大的嗟嘆起來。</p>
<p>趕車的和護兵，接過了吃飽的人手上的碗筷，向鍋子裹各自盛了滿滿的一碗。</p>
<p>［到很多咧！］女人瞧瞧鍋子裹的東西，瞧瞧空著的碗，瞧瞧孩子。</p>
<p>［吃吧，老爹，大哥，嫂子，－呃，多得是，還客什麼氣，趁熱的喫……］</p>
<p>老頭子眼在楞著屋頂上的燕子窩，像沒注意似的，佯驚著：</p>
<p>［什麼呀！哦哦哦哦哦，慢慢兒來好嘞。你們先吃吧。］命令著他的孫媳們。</p>
<p>於是斗大的屋裹，充塞滿了他們吃喝的聲音了。</p>
<p>［好香的。］老頭兒唼唼嘴，舐著花白鬍子上的水珠。對著孫兒說：［慢慢的吃呀，餓過之後該先多喝點湯－－好香的！］他不住用著變得很有生氣的眼瞳向這些慷慨的客人掃射著：［－－想不到半夜三更會有吃的，託福！託福！…］</p>
<p>月光蓋在大地上。門外，只一片遼闊無邊際的昏白色。不知那裹傳來了騾子嘶吼的聲音，繼著三二聲犬吠…</p>
<p>據說，這都是難得聽見的。（完）</p>
<h3>江湖客（六）</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>抹著那右徧的鼻子，並不存加害他們的意思。</p>
<p>［嚇，滑蛋！］</p>
<p>蚯蚓又被盜食了。他依然興緻勃勃的望著魚秧，捲過來又游開去。一直等那撒綱的漁人來了，假裝生氣的，找著談話對手了：</p>
<p>［哎，老鄉，迪是不公道的。……那，應該丟一條活路哪　。呸！］</p>
<p>倘使撒綱者不理他，他會怪模怪樣的眨著眼，放出狡黠的神色，哈哈大笑一陣子。彷彿甚麼在他肚子里爆裂了，不可遇抑的屈下身去。直等到漁人發怒，他咯啦咯啦說著廢話。</p>
<p>［為人應該有良心，知道嗎？良心］！</p>
<p>他大聲說。</p>
<p>［把良心送到藥材行去罷…………鷹也不看咧］！</p>
<p>那人真的想奔上岸去搥他了。眼裹閃出詭詐的光，聲調也放得盡可能的低而且緩慢。欠正的鼻頭動著，他像是為別人的誤解悲哀，或可憐對手竟會那樣生氣。喃喃道：</p>
<p>［是打魚呢，老鄉；我說的］。</p>
<p>八月陽光，帶來不應有的困倦。他懶散的倚生柳樹上，望著綱呌喊的仆下水去，遂瑟唆瑟唆發出柔膩如棉的碎聲。水珠在綱韁上閃爍不定的發光，有種難言的慾望和快感溶合在一起淡雲與蘆花交織暉映，同遠處的青色恰成對比。風閒散的拂過柳梢，發出像來自遠行人腳下的聲音，驚　盡過長空逸去了。</p>
<p>［實你的香荸去罷，好些人等著死呢］。漁人從綱韁上抬起眼來，在胸膛口抹了一把。馬上他那能透視水底的眼發見撒住了一條像樣的鯉，又謹慎的釘住在水面的漩渦。他更動心了。快慰和激悅在他心裹交流，氣窘的呻吟道：</p>
<p>［我，嗡，我也買過呢……你倒是寃人……上當只一遭……咒，咒，咒，……］</p>
<p>［買過嗎？以後別再買了……哈！好標緻一隻鮭子］！（幼鯉）</p>
<p>漁人不理會的撒下綱去，他氣慎的將釣竿扔在一邊、怪聲呌嚷著了：</p>
<p>［要你才是殺人的啦，十條路走絕］！這裹他沒將人和魚分開。［我拉他們嗎？拉他們說－－香荸，通統拏出錢來！不買槍斃！……可是你，嚇！把我的生意搶了哩。呸！］</p>
<p>他拏起釣竿擊著水，長條的波擴張開，魚秧就昏暈的沈下去。</p>
<p>江湖上人常不免有些怪客，無能佯裝有為，狡詐偽稱忠厚。他眨著圓小的眼，在想：良心與騙子。</p>
<p>因為俗諺和現在的景況連結一起，他追溯及魚也有騙子：大魚是吃小魚才長肥的，吃的方法多半佯死，騙小魚和嘏游到近傍……這就是騙子！</p>

<h3>證劵終日徘徊市狀恍惚債劵結果見軟化</h3>
<p>除編遣裁兵一九關外一致小挫</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面又入盤旋之途、比較略形帶疲、市上衹十一號交易為多、大都賣出連期裁兵、買進統監稅、進出均頗形踴躍、賣出方面、比較零星、如四號及五十三號等、賣出並不甚湧、而散戶賣出、則極為熱鬧、趨勢多頭頗有掉期、除上午頭盤外、此後交易至為清閑、前途仍不免繼續盤旋、昨日經過、開盤本月份裁兵猛漲四角半、連期即因十一號出範、頓見由高而下、趨勢受此打擊、頓改趨向、入後十一號雖尚買進統鹽稅、但已見供過於求、故監稅以後、反小二三角、次盤四號及五十三號等均有賣出、本月裁兵猛降半元、馀亦小五分一角至二三角、午後比較混沌、交易亦清、漲跌亦覺恍惚無定、大都前列微好一二角、鹽稅以後、微小一二角、收盤與上盤適得其反、前列微小一二角、後列稍堅、全日趨勢、祇九六比較穩定、市價結果、除編遣及裁兵一九關之連期略好五分一角外、馀均微疲五分一角至二三角左右、成交總數、計共一千三百三十萬元、股票二十股、茲將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元成交單位百元股票單位一股）</p>
<h3>紗花實銷連續存底減縮</h3>
<p>標紗人氣轉高昂</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、漲風微現、現紗客幫需求尚堪維持、多數謂存紗減少、致人心觀高、查塲中買者較衆、因此市盤頗昂、但較一部份云、日信洋行之空額、仍無抵補之念、前途仍恃實銷為　縮、</p>
<p>近期紗補空活動</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉停市、塲中市氣較緊、賣戶缺乏、各月均漲三。四角、拍至二三盤、聞金價跌風未熾、市況仍昂、本月份空頭抵補較多、漲一元三角、遠漲八。九角至一元、午後聞現紗銷路尚好、開盤市勢仍挺、拍至二三盤突轉軟化、因逹記多頭了結、各月微跌一。二。三角、全日成交統計三萬四千七百包、查賣出逹記四千七百包、源大一千一百包、明德四百五十包、賡豊四百五十包、元德二千七百包、大昶四百包、益昶三百包、裕康五百包、均昶七百包、長馀三百五十包、崇安四百包、買進大孚一千二百五十包、通記四百五十包、恒益七百五十包、大豊八百五十包、均昶四百包、仁豊五百五十包、元一二千一百五十包、潤康二千九百五十包、慎昌一千一百包、恒德一千五百五十包、慎記七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>紗銷續有千六百包弱</p>

<h3>預測美棉漲風烈標花買戶大事活動</h3>
<p>棉花轉漲、因滙兌雖長、而金價跌勢未熾、且多數預料今日美棉有大漲風發現、因此人心反見緊俏、　面乾枯、浮空活動抵補、市盤轉趨上升、</p>
<p>鄭標轉升三角半</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、銀價雖長、而金市跌度未烈、預料昨日美棉漲風必熾、因此引起買戶活動、市盤反轉上漲、惟源大號繼續賣出、結果各月漲二三角、午後形勢仍昂、且多頭購進加碼、各月又漲五分至一角、全日成交統計六萬七千三百擔、查賣出大孚一千二百擔、梅記一千擔、逹記三千八百擔、源大五千一百擔、長馀一千一百擔、益昶二千三百擔、益康一千八百擔、均昶一千一百擔、同興一千四百擔、買進大豊三千九百擔、慎昌二千五百擔、均昶三千一百擔、恒德五千二百擔、潤康三千擔、德記一千一百擔、吉豊二千擔、仁豊一千二百擔、長豊一千九百擔、信誠一千六百擔、長和一千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標紗買賣陣容一暼</h3>
<p>賣方以日商為巨戶</p>
<p>買進為金融界居多</p>
<p>本市紗市交易所、標紗存賑數量、至十一月十二日截止、查十一月期成交二萬九千七百包、十二月期四萬六千八百五十包、一月期六萬三千一百五十包、二月期五萬六千一百包、三月期五萬一千五百五十包、四月期一萬九千三百包、合計二十六萬六千六百五十包、查賣方日商及廠商為重心、買進金融界佔多數、茲將內中多空最巨之額　摘錄於後、（單位包）</p>
<h3>美棉無市英印告漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉停市、英棉期貨漲五點、印棉因歐洲出口商、日商及塲中操業者均買進、市況挺秀、計平果爾漲一羅比、奧姆辣漲三羅比、白羅溪漲二。五羅比、原電錄左、（十二日電）</p>
<h3>糧食粉麥同跌</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後　以洋麥報價、芝加哥休息無市、坎拿大小二三角左右、當開價時、以廠家定成洋麥之關係、人心均見疲滯、（或傳廠家實未定成不過洋行方面之兜銷）業內外之買賣、同時寂寞、計近期續小一分左右、遠期因廠家未拋、反呈定局、迨至下午開盤、本月份因實稍未動、曾一度四角進關、小至三角九分、旋以業外人心轉好、廠家出數無幾、各月份步轉穩象、觀日來米市依然堅挺、後步由此帶定、亦未可知也、本月份較跌七釐半、十二月份好二釐半、一二月份跌五釐、三月份跌二釐半、四月份未動云、</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、亦為洋麥關係、故開價時、人心異常冷淡、交易亦未甚暢、本月份一無做開、連期交易亦祇零星而已、迨下午開盤、因紛市見疲、匯率又有日長之可能、業內外人心、徵呈歡　、結果本月份較跌三分、十二月份跌二分、一月份跌一分、二月份跌三分、現麥市面、又入擯勢、以標準步小、洋麥又有兜售、或須擯小一點、方有成交云、</p>
<h3>元米酒作需要尚殷</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各幫來源、尚未見旺、仍祇三十來號、貨共近五千石、更復天雨連綿、人心見昂、售方喊聲繼高、自初市開乎、直至收市、其間銷化雖屬平常、包胃祇動數十包、而行情得能見升一二也、青角松泗西練楓涇等晚稻價、悉增數分至角馀、而常幫蘇同南港等粳及野白稻等亦均提起尺外不等、杜洋尖陰元等各花色並見秀色、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地城鄉到船十馀號、河存百二三十艘、市上各貨消胃、新粳陳白元新羊杜尖薄稻零胃頗稱熱鬧、新陳埠客尖破粳陰元去路清呆、惟陳白元陰元酒戶需貨尚殷、市形新粳薄稻新杜尖價加一角左右、陳白元陰元加昂一二角、新羊尖早稻新陳埠客尖價格平正、無甚上落、</p>
<h3>西貢四月期米開出</h3>
<p>－浙路去米甚旺－</p>
<p>昨日客秈內地去胃甚食、本胃亦佳、故在湖南漢口沙市各埠大批到埠時、市面反而堅定、去路內地較多、尤以浙幫為食、因浙省今年旱災影響、秋收不足故也、遍日洋米定貨續到、洋商求售尤濃、而客秈因浙省貪辦、市面隨至一再上千、目下到頭較多、或可暫時定頓、惟去化迄未見淡、昨日開湘米二千七百七十五包、漢口米三千二百二十五包、沙市各米五千九百包、總計近一萬二千包之多、</p>
<p>洋米近日由暹邏香港到最申者不絕、市上存底尚足、昨洋商兜售期貨、回籠則求去期現兩貨、故帽面稍軟、計開出暹邏二三天交一號碎米五百包、安南粳二百包、西黃一號米二千二百包、期貨十一月三月各開三百噸、則係回籠售出、新交易近期未妥、惟有合義拋出一千噸、則為第一次成交之四月份、價開五元三角二分、（按前日只討價五元三角昨本街一貪價漲二分）由鼎泰等五家分去云、</p>
<h3>黃豆成交昨頗不少紅糧上漲漸定</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市況、形頗緊穩、刻下來源、車輪兩稀、貨主因見產地價高、販運不合、致扳售居多、其去路以常錫幫復見動辦、故行情續漲五六分、陳豆廠家辦青蟬聯、所以市價亦跟砌四五分、成交穎州陳豆六車、新豆三車、牛荘自眉豆一車、大連大粒豆一車、中粒一車、歸德豆五百包、郊城豆三百包、高耿豆一百包、新安鎮豆四百包、蚌埠豆二車、南紹集豆一車、烏龍集豆二車、紅糧現貨來源仍寥寥、昨祇有一車、價開三元五角半原盤、刻下因缺貨、市氣尚緊、二星期交路貨市較見歡、成交二車、價開三元四角二、</p>
<h3>油市產豊銷淡柏油波落</h3>
<p>柏油各產地均已見新、而陳油到處尚屬充裕、且自皂廠用慶絕跡後、燭淘銷塲亦較往年為淡、漢口上週因美商辦過三十五噸後、市面尚有生氣、麻城油曾一度售至十四元以上、乃今又跌至十三元六七角矣、重荊亦跌十四元進關、形勢復又疲弱、蓋陳油未罄、新貨已到、而銷更不振、恐難免步步下遊也、浙江方面、金蘭各地年令大熟、出數已旺、柏子汗水不弱於往年、據每擔可榨白油二十二觔、青油十四觔、年令既豊、收價亦廉、產數必旺無疑、現在產地油價每砠祇十二元四五角、恐尚難立足、惟浙西嘉興一帶年歲大欠、較上年祇四五成收成、故各榨坊均減半做數、而將來產額總數、亦須減去半數、若以往年而衡、重陽前後嘉興一帶車家、必來滬預售拋貨、今庚則寂靜無聲、因產數既少、大家均不敢預拋也、惟陳本車總數尚有三千件、且各處均告豊稔、燭荒嘉興一隅之地、恐將來新貨亦未必如何缺俏、而江浙兩省又是旱荒、多令燭淘用塲、亦難如往年之盤耳、</p>
<h3>疋頭套頭呢天寒已落令</h3>
<p>西裝料套頭花呢、日來無論高等下檔、統皆見疲貨價下游、除拆化店出樣板定落外、其他因天氣寒冷、實銷已過其半、西服幫多忙於大衣工程、而漸停進各種套頭花呢矣、但套頭貨中之色子貢及褲料呢、司泡推克四與新盛行之海列司呢等、則依然暢銷無阻、日有售開、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>王寵惠先生談科罪範圍</h3>
<p>— 法政學院江蕙若女士</p>
<p>王寵惠先生以為刑法草案第二三九條有夫之婦與人通姦者科罪，而有婦之夫與人通姦者則否，認為確有背乎男女平等之原則：然有婦之夫與人通姦者亦科以同等之罪，在事實上亦難以實行，蓋因此項法律實行之後、娶妾者固皆刑事犯也。我國娶妾者逹百分之三十以上，若亦科之以同刑，則恐我全國監獄不足容此有婦之夫與人通姦罪者，故王先生主張有夫之婦，或有婦之夫犯通姦者，可規定於民法範圍之內，不必視為刑事犯，本人竊以為不可，正因中國男子犯通姦罪之多，故宜立法以罰之，若犯通姦，不視為刑事犯，豈足以矯正現今淫蕩之風，而維護家庭之和平也？況現時男子因攖得經濟上之優勢，處處壓迫婦女，使婦女不能獲得經濟獨立，無自由謀生之技能，惟可依賴丈夫，低首下心，戰戰兢兢，惟恐丈夫之遺棄也，處在男子權威之下，茍生偷活，何敢有所主張耶：若犯通姦者以之規定於民法範圍之內，則夫妻之一方，與人通姦者惟構成離婚之理由，試問離婚後之受苦者為夫乎，為妻乎？必答曰，當然為妻也，因男子握經濟之優勢，又為社會習慣所縱容，離婚後極易續婚，若婦女則不然，既無謀生之技能，又為社會所排斥，欲謀得一自活之職業，難如登天，若再嫁，又為舊道德惡風俗所唾棄，為習慣所束縛，如以犯通姦者規定於民族範轉之內，是縱男子犯姦也，是烏乎可！若懼監獄不足以容有婦之夫犯姦者，則可援法律不溯既往之原則，頒佈特別法令以辦理之，凡自新刑法公布施行前所犯姦者則不罰：惟須至法院登記，若登記後再有犯通姦者，則依新刑法處罰，如此則既合男女平等之原則，又符正風勵俗之旨，就正於王先生以為如何？</p>
<h3>閑話捲煙</h3>
<p>— 吳式</p>
<p>這幾個月來上海各報的封面廣告幾乎都被香煙公司包了去，據說這廣告的定價不小哩，但是那些香煙價錢挺便宜，每包銅元十六枚，彷彿同行公議似的不折不扣，而贈品真把人家的眼睛看紅了，新式汽車一輛：登了一輛汽車的照片。更恐怕抽煙的人不識貨似的，這不是做夢嗎，抽抽捲煙抽出這麼個動兒來，何怪有人大聲疾呼提倡抽雅片。雖然公賣的已公賣，但吃官司照樣要吃官司，不是這個樣子說的話，或者購雲士一兩，有洋房一宅到廣告早已堂而皇之登出來了。</p>
<p>不過廣告登了這末許多時候，雖有幾家香煙公司把得主的姓名地址刋佈出來，據熟悉內幕中人云，有些靠大勿住。上海人是最聰明的民族，應該不再去上這個當了，可是這類轉向廣告是有增無減，自然，無論市面不景氣到買一送十，蝕本倒底勿是生意經，送汽車當然有送汽車的利息在內，何況汽車根本就沒有送掉！然則明知而故犯之，抽香煙的人都是阿木林？那是誰說的，五十萬</p>

<p>元的航空獎券明知沒有［我］的分，為什麼買的人趨之若鶩呢？曰：有二獎，三獎，末三字，末二字，甚至末一字，已經是對本對利了啊！所以抽［獎煙］的希望多著呢，熱水瓶，毛巾，茶杯，這些都是超煙價而上之，那為什麼不抽呢？甚至，甚至大號火柴一盒，不是最值用的必需品嗎？要抽香煙沒有火，向人家借，就是兩聲［對不起］！現在多末寫意，立在煙紙門口，像對航空獎券號碼低的，慢慢地撕去外面［注意贈品］的包皮紙，謹慎地推開盒蓋－自然，當時好像［汽車一輛］四個字在眼前飛過，（人就是這末希望到死的萬物之靈啊）！及至看清楚了是大號火柴一盒，就裝做了嘸介事的向櫃臺上一摔，隨手接來一盒火柴，可以有條不紊的抽起香煙來了，不必說什麼［對不起，借個火］。</p>
<p>這就是香煙公司老圓的手段，騙人要騙得人家不喊寃枉，或者說一聲我知道他騙人的。這樣利息雖小，可以高枕無憂。</p>
<p>不過，搥多的是不過，近來有些人存這小小的［大號火柴］上轉念頭了。要知道積少成多，聚沙成塔，偽造鈔票的專造一角貨幣劵就是這個道理，一千張火柴值大洋七元哩！</p>
<p>造呀造的造出了交交關關，十個七元七十元，百個七元七百元，此公真可謂生財有道，豈不知人家化了［新式汽車］的大本錢呢？這些下流的東西！</p>
<p>末了擲重聲明，題目［捲煙］之上加了［閑話］，不過是閑話而已，希望不要和別的［閑話ＸＸ］作為一例。</p>
<h3>［吭喲］漫話</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>幾年前初到上海，對於上海的一切機械文明覺得無限新奇與趣味，碼頭上，市街心衣著襤褸肩負重荷的苦力的吭喲之聲也在為我心目中的新奇趣味的景物。那時跟著一個朋友從法大馬路沿黃浦灘，白渡橋，步行至北四川路的上海戲院。幾次要穿過十字街口，那位朋友看了我不慣熟的莽撞的走法，一邊為我解釋紅綠燈的作用，挾雜入打趣的笑語外，為了我屢次忽然停住腳注聽那些苦力吭喲吭喲的神情，也給他打趣了好幾次。日子久了，也許可說是受了上海文明的洗禮。知道這個舉動在上海街頭露出來要給人笑話的。可是這個上海風景之一的吭喲，實在給與我的趣味過濃，每當夜深市靜，躑過較為僻靜的街路，碰著澈夜工作的建築之人哼出的吭喲聲音，還會暗暗的站在一邊傾神注聽。</p>
<p>十年前跟祖母到南洋去，經過新加坡，檳榔嶼，馬冷幾個埠頭，看見碼頭上的桔林人一邊勞動一邊歌唱的神情就感到無限趣味。在緬甸時候住在一個山巴的小鎮上，房子恰巧鄰貼火車站，每每聽到這種粗簡而哀的歌聲，盡如喝著清淡的咖啡，心神為之悠揚不置，那時年歲尚少，對於其他的印象現在都不大清晣了，只盡桔林人的勞作時的歌唱（緬甸作苦之的多屬桔林人）到今還有深切的印象。前年經過香港與廣州，也聽到這種吭喲之聲。但較之上海的似乎缺少一種清朗妥切的音律。總沒看上海的好聽。</p>
<p>這次回鄉要做的事情雖然全部失敗，一無所成，但能得此機會返鄉一覩故鄉的情形也頗值得的。對於逐漸都市他的故鄉，似乎并沒看什麼感想與讚嘆，而令我非常驚奇的就是在那許許多多勒增加的建築工人，碼頭擔夫，與肩挑背負的農夫樵者口中，竟聽不到吭喲吭喲的聲音，在筋暴肉漲的勞作下，忍著聲吞著氣可無一點弛懈與萎弱的姿態與表情，工作的速度，旋律仍然非常緊張。看到這種沉著嚴肅的表露祇覺得無限悲壯與偉大。與上海的吭喲趣味又非同日可語的了。</p>
<p>年齡與閱歷於人生，社會的認識是有很大關係的。無論上海的也罷，桔林人的也罷，故鄉的也罷，都可以在比較中看出各個不同民族性的秉質。同是一樣勞作，一樣肩負著千鈞的生活重荷，一是吭喲吭喲的表露其對生活的屈服與哀憐，一沉是著嚴肅，表露其悲壯堅卓的生活的力。曾然彷彿看人說過工人工作時發出的吭喲之聲係本能上的反應，要從那一唱一喝中緩和麻醉肢體的疲乏。這或許是另看理由的一種說法罷。</p>

<h3>婆媳不和兒子受罪</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>五年前我就和一位由父母替我物色的舊式女子結婚了。在迎娶前，為著禮金關係，父母和我的岳丈就發生意見；因此結婚後，母親對於我的妻子，常抱著輕視態度，被則在言語中譏刺，繼則一舉一動加以虐待。</p>
<p>我呢，離鄉背井，路遠遙遙的在社會上服務，所得薪金，悉供家用，一無積蓄，一年中返鄉不過一次二次罷了。而每次回這，母親總是含著熱淚，很懊喪的向我訴苦。那時我深信言無欺，就對妻子嚴加壓迫，促其與母親和好。唉！可憐的弱妻，曾受了我許多寃枉氣。後來她（妻子）竟因受不住壓迫而自盡過一次，雖然遇救，但我頓受著良心上的重大的譴責，使我醒悟不少；當是又有鄰里和親戚們的勸導，我才得悉其中究竟。上述的就是我婚後三年生活史的大部份的情形。</p>
<p>後來我每次回家，母親雖然仍是不斷的向我啼哭，我只是兩面敷衍；那時母親見我待妻子，沒有從前那樣的激烈，她就用盡方法，使我們夫婦失和，但始終逹不到目的，最後就反轉面來向我進攻，我的痛苦史，從此也就開始了。</p>
<p>父親他是懂人事的人，他見我們一對小夫妻不和睦，總是很誠意的從中勸解；但母親不是吵天鬧地的和他糾緾，就是用絕食的手段威迫她，父親給他緾得沒法可想，也只得依著她起初不過為求太平計敷衍她，後來也就被同化了。</p>
<p>此後我和父母見了面，他們總名我以［逆子］，輕則咒罵，重則痛打，有時要驅逐我，有時又監禁我，弄得我無路可走。村鄰親戚們的勸解，總是不能使他們覺悟，我處於這種環境，始終以［忍］字來維持暫時的局面，但到了現在，實在忍無可忍了。</p>
<p>最近我幾次要求將妻子帶出來，他們又怕我斷絕供給，不肯允許，並且又在外揚言：我將妻子帶出來，居心不良；定要先出來和我死緾，使我不得安業於外………等等的話。</p>
<p>先生：你是黑暗中的光明，懇求你指示我們一條生路吧！</p>
<p>敬祝　　撰安　　余人則上</p>
<p>編者按：由於女子們心眼的狹小，以及其他特殊的原因，在一般婆媳間很多因意見不和而發生衝突的。我們覺得這種現象，在現在是很普遍，像余君。的家庭就是其中之一。</p>
<p>根據來信所述：余君背井離鄉，路途遙遠的在外邊服務，把所有的薪金，都供給家庭之用，而他的父母非但不鼓勵他，安慰他，並且因為和親家意見不合的一點小怨氣，就竭力的虐待媳婦，設法使兒媳失和，似乎太固執了，太不像父母對待子女的行為了。</p>
<p>我們認為余君也不必過於憂愁，像這種情形只要應付適當，絕不會發生什</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>麼意外的變故的。現在余君第一步的辦法是先行設法疏通雙方的感情，假使父母與妻子間能夠互相諒解，很和洽的生活下去，那當然最好，否則可以暫把妻子送回娘家，或親戚家裹去住一些時候，以和緩雙方衝突的空氣。然後再觀察將來的情勢，她可以回到家庭來。我想只要岳家或親戚，能夠明瞭，諒解你的苦衷，他們也許不會拒絕的，假使暫住在人家，又有許多困難，那末就要看你有沒有同時供給兩個家庭的能力了。如有這種能力，就可以把你的妻子帶到你所服務的地方，另組一個小家庭，這也不是什么違法的事。至於父母那方面，只要你不斷絕他們的生活費用，料想他們也不會怎樣和你［死緾］的。</p>

<h3>劉得勝在江西（六）</h3>
<p>— 萬國安</p>
<p>三第幾師都忘了</p>
<p>［你不要裝傻了！］小娘們也噗嚇的一笑，同時把小臉旦往黑大個的腮幫上一摩擦，熱勁越發加增起來，黑大個餓虎撲食似的，用那有力的臂膊，就把小娘們　在懷裹，兩個人合攏的黑影，在土墻上急劇的帽動了半天，那昏暗的燈光，怕羞似的也愈顯著昏暗了。</p>
<p>這是黑大個彷佛久餓的漢子，忽然吃飽了似的那樣愉快，無力地喘吁吁地在破木床上，晚風一陣陣涼嗖嗖的，從窗洞裹吹進來，輕輕拂著他頭上的熱氣。</p>
<p>那個小娘們也無力地躺在他的臂膊上，嘴裹慢慢的說著：［你要記住！明天開會歡迎你，……你記住吧？］</p>
<p>［太多了，我記不住，］黑大個只顧在那回味著剛繞的滋味，簡直就沒有聽見，她這樣一問，黑大個順嘴就說了這麼一句。</p>
<p>四臺底下可反了</p>
<p>第二天小村子外面的一塊空地上，幾塊不整齊的木板，支架成了一個小臺子，前面站了許多人，穿破爛灰軍服的傢伙，雜亂地在擁擠著，年輕的小娘們還是笑嘻嘻的，手裹拿著小紅旗，到處喊著笑著吵嚷著。</p>
<p>黑大個這時彷彿作了英雄，屁股後跟著一羣瘦鬼模樣的官長，小娘們又把他包圍了一陣子，纔讓他們走上臺去，一個矮小個子的人，先站在臺口上喊了一陣子，黑大個模糊地只聽見幾句！</p>
<p>［……白…同志。…當紅軍。……］</p>
<p>那個小個子喊完了，退回來和他說！</p>

<h3>李思廉霍華德力求隱秘的理由</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>除去工作之外不願多所談話</p>
<p>私人意思行動最易引起誤會</p>
<p>據李思廉霍華德（leslie　howard)自己所宣佈的，他以後要將自己隱秘起來了。關乎一切新聞記者的訪問，凡是來刺探他的私生活的內容，以及他的個性，行動等等的，他將步著神秘女郎葛雷泰嘉寶的後座，一概秘而不宣了。至於凱絲琳赫本，那更不足道了。這件事已經謠傅得很久了。後來聽說他已經決策了。許多影迷們，凡是關心李思廉霍華德的，於是忙了起來，大家都寫信去問他，或是供給他意見。很奇怪的，這許多信之中，居然有許多是贊成他隱秘的。但是直到最近他啟程到英國去的時候，才有一位新聞記者，在碼頭上和他作了一次簡短的談話，證實了以上所說的謠言。他承認了他的計劃，並且說這次談話或者亦許是他最後一次的和新聞記者的談話。所以他到底抱的是什麼宗旨，有什麼理由，我們且來研究一下。</p>
<p>李思廉說：［是的。這件事我已經思想了好幾個月了。現在我已經決定了。我不贊成將一個人的私生活，公開了給大家來考察。我覺得那不是正當的。你想想，那種關乎個人瑣碎的特別宣傅，不是太無理取鬧了嗎］？關乎個人的瑣碎，特意的宣傅，或者是不正當的，但是為什么李思廉要拒絕一切新聞記者的訪問呢？為什麼他不將可以告訴人家的事情，和新聞記者談話，向大衆略為公佈些呢］？李思廉說：［那是無須的。他們會從別的方面訪出來的。他們有本領可以說得源源本本，比我自己說的還詳細。至於個人的宣傅，老實說，許多人是喜歡的，但我卻不喜歡］，他說話時候的態度很堅定。他又繼續說道：［要是新聞記者來訪問的時候，光問此關於我的工作的事情，無論在銀幕上，或是在舞臺上，我還無妨和他談話，但是不可避免的，就是他們不久就要問到我的種種私人的思想行動等等了。再則，我好像有必須回答一切問題的義務似的，並且我的回答還一定要合乎一般讀者的心理，使他們覺到滿意。這實在對於一個知識成熟的人，責任太重大了。有的時候，我用了誠意來解答一個問題，而不用外交手段來解答，我就有觸怒於幾千幾萬人的危險。要是我說了批評好萊塢的話，要是不好聽了，人家就罵我是英國的島民了。當然，我是英國人民，我並不忌諱，但是從藝術方面說起來，國籍的思想，從來沒有進過我的腦筋，無論在舞臺上或是在銀幕上。但是在新聞記者的口中，國籍好像是一件大事似的。譬如我說，我願意我的子女在我的本國受教育。那當然完全是我個人的私事，絲毫沒有想到英美國界之分。但是等到這句話一傅出去，大家就哄然說道：［他在美國賺了許多錢，他卻不贊成美國的教育］！照事實而論，小孩子們在英國已經有了許多朋友。他們已經習慣於英國的學校，為什麼我一定要打斷了他們的學業，將他們搬到美國來呢？</p>
<p>［所以提起了一個人的私人生活，私人意見等，就有許多容易引起誤會的地方。他明明有充足的理由，但是他沒有詳細加以說明，或者由於新聞記者的疏忽而沒有說得詳確，就往往引起了外界的非議。這樣看來，還不如不說話的好了。所以以後我除了我的工作之外，我一概不如人家提到別的事。所可惜的，關乎工作的事，喜歡聽的人並不多，了解一位演員的工作的，亦祇有演員同道之輩。當然，要是談論到你穿的什麼襪子，吸的什麼香煙，聽的人就多了］。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>［婦道］我評</h3>
<p>— 費念祖</p>
<p>以教育影片為號召的［婦道］，終於公映了，但是當我看完了本片，又不禁使我大為失望，感到［婦道］是一個平凡的作品，可是在這教育影片缺乏的中國，和從畫面給我們看到的，總算還是一個水平綫以上的作品。</p>
<p>導演陳鏗然在本片中非常的努力，因此全劇自始至終，收到了空氣一貫的效果。有幾個小聰明處也不差。例如在上課時教授問，［中國怎樣］，而保生剛剛在磕睡，於是一個答案，無形的由保生解答了。保生因有影戲而返家甚遲，對家中人說是校中的功課忙，但是卻掉下了戲院的說明書。保生推託買書，而其妻，母及其妹等，皆出衣物典質，………等都有相當的可取。不過劇作者，祇注重了家庭教育，而忽略了更大的社會教育。祇要不買糖給小孩吃，便是一個典形的良母了嗎？</p>
<p>演員，宣景琳的老母，堪稱老練。爐火純青，不失為此中老手。徐琴芳並沒有相當的進步，但是卻保持了已往的成績。胡藝星，恨我識淺，在銀幕上還是初次相見，不失為可造之才。本片尚有相當成績。朱秋痕有特殊的貢獻，一副淫蕩的作風，活潑可愛。蕭英的教授，也表演得逼真。</p>
<h3>［婦道］我評</h3>
<p>— 章子規</p>
<p>首先該說：［婦道］是一部比較有意識的國產影片。</p>
<p>必然的，一個人長成以後的好和壞，其根本的基礎便是家庭教育。然至家庭教育任務的重要性多半是建築在做母親者的身上的，所以我們是很需要新興的［賢母良妻］。因此我們對於這以［兒童教育］為號召的［婦道］是懷著很大的希望的。但是［婦道］所給予我的印象是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>［婦道］的劇作者，在他的思想上講，取材是偉大的。可是在他整個的原理和概念方面說，未免是太隨筆化了，拉雜地把他湊成了一部電影腳本。這不得不使觀察衆們引為遺憾的。</p>
<p>然而，［婦道］也有可取的地方：描寫保生長成後的個性，受了母親溺愛的毒素，結果使他成為一個思想下乘，不思上進，而墮落於罪惡淵藪的腐化青年。同時，他寫瑞芝因經濟困難，所以她去做女職員，死心塌地的來教育她自己的兒子，這便是［婦道］的中心點，幸一般為人父母者注意及之。</p>
<p>不過，在［婦道］裹是沒有更進一步，更澈底的認識。合理的家庭教育該怎樣的努力進取，他都沒有明白地指示出來，這該說是［婦道］最重大的缺點吧？</p>
<p>至有導演人的手法，也只平平而已。而且二個臨死的塲面，保生都是很湊巧地走來送終，以及他爹爹死後祭靈檯和燒錫箔等，也只是含著濃厚的迷信觀念。</p>
<p>就表演上而論，演員們是稱職的。</p>

<h3>百言集</h3>
<p>— 林擒</p>
<p>電影刋物已成為了一種工具了，什麼工具呢？就是船人利用電影刋物來發洩私人的私慾，來罵人，來揭開它人的私德而與電影毫無關係的事；試問，像這類的電影刋物還有什麼存在的價值咧！</p>
<p>女從業員的一切，最引起一般影迷的注意，許多無聯的文人，便利用這一點，無中生有造出些奇特的消息來，什麼某某女星的愛人是ＸＸＸ，什麼某某女星要結婚了，什麼某某女星要離婚了，什麼………，連女星的肚子大的問題，都要連二連三地提出來討論；在他們的目的不過是想要引起一般影迷的注意，而這種工作對於電影的本身，是毫無益處的。</p>
<p>［自編自導］在中國電影圈內最流行，每一個編劇都做導演，每一個編劇都想要［自編自導］；每一個導演都想兼編劇，每一個導演都想要［自編自導］；真的，我不相信會編劇的人就會導演，而導演的人就會編劇！編劇和導演顯然是兩種不同的工作。中國人真聰明，不然怎會產生出來這樣許多［自編自導］的［萬能博士］呢？</p>

<h3>相逢恨晚（The　Agc　of　Innocencence）（三）</h3>
<p>— 李信</p>
<p>紐倫眼看著愛琳飛奔上樓而去，又不敢跟上去，祇得在樓下等待著，希望她能夠回來，但是等了半天，她仍舊不下來。全屋子是那樣的岑寂，祇有墻壁火爐裹的火聲，忽落忽落的隱約可聞。紐倫慢吞吞地穿上了大衣，戴上了帽子，自己開了門，走入深夜之中。他好像中了異樣的魔力一樣。他吻到了愛琳明谷了，他的生命的全部受了特別的變化了。這時梅蕙蘭的家屬，都已去到南方的福祿利逹去過冬去了。梅不久亦將離開紐約而到南方去。但是紐倫卻希望她不要去，因為祇要她在紐約，他們的訂婚，他們未來的結婚，他們渺小的但極堅固的社交範圍，都顯得是真實的。但是要是她離開了紐約，這一切都要像紙牌搭成的房子，倒下來了。他知道他們兩個人的關係的基礎，已經到了危乎殆哉的境地，將來傾倒之後，他和愛琳的愛情，就會層樓疊宇的建築志來，掩蓋過一切。那個建築物的蔭翳，將籠罩他所愛的每一個人的生命。因此他就設法勸著梅，不要到福祿利逹去。可是梅笑著說道：［不過我的父母都在那裹，我不能不去。你真是可愛的傻子－這樣心急做什麼？］同時愛琳亦深恐梅到福祿利逹去。她要是去了，就沒有人可以阻止紐倫來到她家了。應酬亦少了，亦沒有人去過問他的事了。［哦，上帝呀！我為什麼要回到美國來呢？］她自己譴責著她自己。</p>
<p>結果梅蕙蘭還是去了。愛琳和紐倫亦不再裝假了。他們每天會著。白天是急急忙忙地過著，各各心慌意亂地料理各人的事，盼望著夜晚的來到，他們就可以在一起了。親戚們都奇怪地議論著：［怎麼愛琳和紐倫常常在一起的？明谷老太太聽見了，一定會說：［那是必需的。紐倫是在料理她的案件，她的案子，又是很多的。讓他們喜歡怎樣就怎樣好了！］有一天紐倫又來了。愛琳去開了他進來，從他的手裹接過一捧玫瑰花來。她低聲說道：［你總送我花，使我的屋子不斷地香著。］她說的時候，眼睛裹露出一種幽怨之色。紐倫柔聲道：［我要這樣，我的寶貝。我要永遠永遠能這樣。］愛琳將花突然放了下來喊道：［哦，紐倫，我們永信這樣過下去，怎麼興呢？我一生做了多少事情，儘著人家去議論紛紛，但是我卻從來沒有斡過這種偷偷摸摸的事！我亦沒有瞞過人！這算什麼呢？你應當替梅想想。你亦應當替你的母親想想－替大家想想。］紐倫道：［我都想過了，愛琳。我所知道的，祇是我沒有了你，我就不能活著了。在你一方面，你的離婚，一定要辦妥了。我一方面－我去告訴他們－我去和梅說去－］愛琳道：［哎喲，即不可興。你不想想，這是於你的前途有妨害的。並且你的家庭不贊成這件事，勢必至於和你脫離關係。這個犧牲得太大了。］紐倫道：［為了你，沒有什麼犧牲可以說是太大的－我的前途，我的家屬，一切的一切，都算不了什麼。］愛琳道：［紐倫，你可要想明白了，不能夠瞎來的。我想，你先到福祿利逹去。你去看看梅。等你回來了再說。］紐倫聽了愛琳的話，真的跑到福祿逹利，滿心滿意的要將這件事，和梅說明白了。可是等到他見了梅的面，他的心又寒了半截。他怎忍得使她悲傷流淚呢－她是那樣的年輕，毫無機詐，一心一意信仰著他。（未完）</p>

<h3>Automobile Driver and Mr. Deng Zixun Simultaneously Meet Disaster</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's General Manager, Mr. Shi Liangcai, went to Hangzhou for recuperation on October 6th. Yesterday afternoon, around 1 p.m., he took his private car from Hangzhou back to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Those in the car with him were his wife, his son Yonggeng, his son's school friend Deng Zixun (a 23-year-old second-year student at Zhijiang College in Hangzhou), and a relative, Ms. Zhou, plus the driver, making a total of six people. Unexpectedly, around 3 p.m., when the car passed Wengjiabu near Haining, a car with the registration number "Jing 72" suddenly appeared in front, blocking the road. At the same time, several bandits got out of the car and shot the driver and Deng Zixun dead, one after the other. Mr. Shi and his wife and son Yonggeng, seeing the critical situation, hurriedly got out of the car and ran to take cover. Mrs. Shi injured herself when she got out of the car. Mr. Shi tried his best to escape, but four bandits chased after him relentlessly. He then fled into a thatched cottage and escaped through the back door, only to be surrounded by the bandits. Unable to escape, he was eventually killed by the bandits. As for his son Yonggeng, three bandits chased after him as he ran, firing more than twenty shots, but because he ran very fast, none of them hit him, and he was spared. He then safely returned to Hangzhou. Mrs. Shi returned to the Shi residence in Hangzhou, and according to a telegram from our newspaper's Hangzhou office, she was spitting up blood non-stop. Ms. Zhou was also shot when bullets were flying around. She is now being treated at the Hangzhou Guangji Hospital, and the bullet has already been removed. Mr. Shi's body has also been moved to his Hangzhou residence. At that time, the bandits, seeing that their goal had been achieved, immediately got into their original car and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the nearby police received the news and sent police officers to take care of the situation. At the same time, they telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government. After receiving the news, the Provincial Government immediately dispatched a team to pursue the criminals and telegraphed Shanghai Mayor Wu, requesting that he dispatch a team to intercept them. Mayor Wu immediately dispatched a team to intercept them on both the highway and the railway. After receiving the news, our newspaper was shocked and mourned the incident. We dispatched reporters to Hangzhou overnight to take care of everything and decided to move Mr. Shi's body to his residence on Hartung Road in Shanghai today for the funeral. Mr. Shi devoted himself to the newspaper business for more than twenty years and worked diligently to achieve today's success. He devoted himself to social welfare and was approachable. His sudden death is truly regrettable to all members of society. An abridged biography of Mr. Shi is attached below. Mr. Shi Liangcai, whose original name was Jiaxiu, was from Nanjing, Jiangsu. He later moved to Sijing, Songjiang, and became a native of Songjiang. He was 56 years old. He was intelligent from a young age and fond of studying new subjects. He entered the Hangzhou Sericulture School and studied chemistry. During the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, after graduating, he came to Shanghai and founded the Women's Sericulture School. He also taught at the Manufacturing Bureau. Those who advocated new learning regarded him as a role model. Gradually, he also served as a director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. At that time, famous figures such as Tang Zhexian and Wang Dankui all valued him greatly, so they specially recruited him. During the Xinhai Revolution, he participated in the revolutionary cause. He consulted with figures such as Cheng Xuelou, Zhang Jian, and Ying Jizhong on everything. After the founding of the Republic of China, he devoted himself to social welfare and took over the Shen Bao newspaper. He believed that the foundation of the country lies in the people's culture, and that promoting culture requires public opinion to come first. Therefore, for more than twenty years, he managed and operated the newspaper without the slightest懈怠 (xie dai, negligence/laxness), and the business of the Shen Bao newspaper was able to thrive, all thanks to his lifelong efforts. Gradually, he felt that social undertakings were urgent and that business development was the foundation of wealth creation. Therefore, he co-founded the Zhongnan Bank with Huang Yizhu, a merchant from Southeast Asia, the Wuzhou Pharmacy with Mr. Xiang Songmao, and the Zhonghua Book Company with Lu Feibohong. He also established the Minsheng Cotton Mill, all of which prospered. As a result, people in Shanghai respected him, and the government often consulted him. During the January 28th Incident, Shanghai was almost devastated. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association was established, and Mr. Shi initiated it and oversaw its completion. When it was changed to the Local Association, he continued to serve as the chairman. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Government established a Council of Advisors to pave the way for democracy, and Mr. Shi was appointed as the speaker. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and nationalized it. Mr. Shi was also highly regarded and appointed as a director. Recently, in the reorganization of the Red Cross Society, he was elected as honorary president. Mr. Shi also believed that the foundation of a newspaper lies in paper, so he devoted himself to the establishment of the Wenxi Paper Mill. When the Ministry of Industry was in charge, he was appointed as a preparatory committee member. Mr. Shi paid the most attention to cultural undertakings throughout his life. Therefore, the Shen Bao newspaper's affiliated businesses, such as the tutorial school, circulating library, yearbook, and monthly publication, were established one after another, which greatly contributed to enlightening the public's wisdom. When the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center was established, he was also appointed as a director. In addition, he participated in almost all social organizations that were related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. As a result, in recent years, he had been exhausted and often suffered from stomach ailments. This time, he went to West Lake to recuperate, but unexpectedly met with an accidental misfortune. This is not only a misfortune for the public opinion circles, but also a loss for Chinese society. This morning at 3:20 a.m., we received a follow-up telephone report from Hangzhou stating that Mr. Shi left his residence in Hangzhou by car at 2:20 p.m. yesterday and drove to the Bo'ai Town area of the Fourth District of Haining, about four miles away from Wengjiabu. Six bandits ambushed by the roadside suddenly jumped out and first shot out the car tires, making the car unable to move. The bandits stepped forward and shot the driver Huang Jincai and Mr. Deng Zixun dead. At that time, Mr. Shi was already shot in the hat. He hastily opened the car door and fled. The others followed suit. At this time, two bandits chased Mr. Shi, and three bandits closely pursued Yonggeng. Mr. Shi fled into the home of Shen Ruifu at No. 23, Zhakou Lane in the area. The bandits also chased after him, so he escaped through the back door, but he did not know the way and had to hide in a dry small pond. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by a bandit on the road, who stepped forward and opened fire. One bullet pierced both ears, causing a fatal wound. At that time, Mr. Shi's son Yonggeng tried his best to escape, and the three bandits fired continuously, firing more than twenty shots. Yonggeng was exhausted and was caught up by the three bandits, but fortunately, the bandits ran out of bullets, otherwise, he would have been in great danger. After the bandits fled, Mrs. Shi, Yonggeng, and Ms. Zhou hid in the Wengjiabu Station. The Aviation School received the news and sent a car to pick them up and take them to the school for temporary shelter before escorting them to their residence in Hangzhou. After receiving the news, the Hangzhou authorities, in addition to dispatching a team to strictly pursue the criminals, also sent an ambulance each from the Hangzhou Municipal Government and the Zhejiang Public Security Bureau to the scene of the incident to transport the three corpses to Hangzhou, where they were temporarily placed in the Tingyun Villa in West Lake. According to the results of the examination by Prosecutor Zhu Nianci of the Hangzhou County Local Court, Mr. Shi was shot twice, Deng Zixun was shot twice, and the driver Huang Jincai was shot eleven times. The Hangzhou authorities paid great attention to this major case and overnight ordered the Zhejiang Province's highways to be closed to traffic. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road also implemented passenger inspections. It was also reported that the bandits were all wearing black robes and copper basin hats.</p>
<h3>Great Victory for the Southern Route Army in Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>Fierce fighting occurred near Yanshou, and the entire pseudo-19th Army Corps was annihilated. The remaining bandits fled between Y章 and L武.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, Yu Hanmou, 12th) A telegram reported that yesterday, near Yanshou, more than twenty li away from Jiufeng, the entire pseudo-1st and 9th Army Corps that had been confronting our forces were attacked by our Ye Division, the 3rd Independent Division, and the Chen Zhang Brigade. 4,000 to 5,000 bandits were killed, more than 8,000 guns were seized, and thousands of people were captured. The pseudo-19th Army Corps has been completely annihilated. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Cantonese aircraft detected that the main force of the bandits was between Y章 and L武. To avoid bombing by aircraft, the bandits inserted tree branches on their heads. When they heard the sound of aircraft, they gathered together, and from the air, they were mistaken for forests. This tactic has been discovered by the air force, which has been dispatched in recent days. Whenever it encounters something resembling a forest, it bombs it. Thousands of bandits have been killed or wounded. In the battle of Yanshou, only a thousand or so members of the pseudo-19th Army Corps escaped towards Y 章 D 窦 (Dou). This is the biggest victory on the southern route since the start of the war.</p>

The headquarters reported on the weekly commemoration on the 12th that the bandits had fled west and were now in the R城 and R化 (Renhua) areas of southern Hunan. The southern and western routes are intercepting them. Only scattered bandits and elderly and weak civilians remain in Yun都 (Yundu) and Hu昌. Zhangsha held victory celebrations for the suppression of bandits on the 12th and 13th. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) This afternoon, we received an official telegram from the front line stating that the Cantonese army had won another major victory near Yanshou on the Hunan border, capturing thousands of Communist bandits and seizing 8,000 rifles.

<p>(Tianjin) Kong Xiangxi and Soong Mei-ling, along with their entourage and guards, arrived in Tianjin by special train at 5:25 p.m. on the 13th. Lu Mutin and Ding Chungao came with them. Yu Xuezhong rushed back to Tianjin in the morning and went to the station with his wife in the afternoon to welcome Kong and Soong. After getting off the train, Kong briefly greeted the welcoming crowd and went with Yu to the Astor Hotel. Soon, Yu's wife also accompanied Soong Mei-ling to the hotel for a brief chat. Yu and his wife then excused themselves. Kong then met with people from all walks of life at the Central Bank and decided to take the original train south to Jinan on the 14th to meet with Han Fuqu. Kong's plane also flew from Ping to Tianjin at 3 p.m. that afternoon. Taking advantage of the flight to Tianjin, Kong sent Ning Encheng, Yang Baoling, and four others to inspect the progress of the Haihe River project downstream of the Yongding River. Kong decided to personally inspect it on the 14th and convene the leaders of various central tax agencies to talk and inquire about the tax situation. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the financial situation of Ji Province, Ding Chungao and others jointly proposed a motion at the last administrative meeting, but it was retained because the scope was too broad. Now, after Ding and others have studied it with Rong Wenyong, the representative of the Ministry of Finance and co-proposer, it has generally been offset by income and expenditure. It is now scheduled to hold a temporary meeting at the Provincial Government at 9 a.m. on the 14th. In addition to Rong Ding and Zeng Jiafeng, Yu and all the members of the Provincial Committee will participate. It is expected that after this meeting, the local budget of the province will be balanced. Zhang Houwan, the new director of the Ji Civil Affairs Department, is scheduled to take office on the 16th. Zheng Daoru, the new director of education, telegraphed his resignation to the Provincial Committee and the department director. Wei Jian, the former director of the Civil Affairs Department, completed the handover and gave instructions to his subordinates on the 13th. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kong said that his trip north was partly to inspect the water conservancy situation and partly to investigate the financial situation of various provinces. He took the opportunity to return to Taigu to take care of private affairs. Just as Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Bing, he flew from Jing京 (Jing, Nanjing) to Bing. The abolition of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies and local apportionments in Jin and Cai provinces reduces the burden on the people by at least 20 million each year. Shanxi Province has been in financial distress for years, and the people are exhausted. In the future, the central government will provide appropriate subsidies. In terms of water conservancy, plans have been drawn up and work has begun on dredging and irrigating the Fen River. Then, because the financial organs of Pingfang urgently needed inspection, he flew from Bing to Ping. During that time, he had contact with Chairmen Huan作义 (Zuo Yi, Zuoyi), and Song Mingxuan of Cai province regarding finance. The Haihe River project is related to the prosperity of Tianjin and the lives of farmers. He will travel from Ping to Tianjin on the 14th to personally inspect the reservoirs and gate works upstream of the Haihe River. As for the financial situation in Ji province, he sent Commissioner Rong Wenyong north to discuss it with Director Lu and others. The revenue and expenditure have now been adjusted. In terms of military spending, the central government will provide an additional monthly subsidy of 100,000. Yu and Madame Chiang are scheduled to take a car south on the 14th (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>

After arriving in Tianjin, Kong will make a brief stop and then transfer to Jinan for inspection. His private plane, the Conant, flew to Tianjin this morning for standby. After inspecting the financial and water conservancy situation in North China, Kong will transfer to Jin and return to Jing. The special train taken by Song and Kong started its engines at 10 a.m. this morning. Later, because Song and Kong had not completed their affairs in Ping, it was changed to 2:15 p.m. to Nankai and went to the station to send them off. There were Shang Zhen, Song Zheyuan, Bao Wenwei, He Qigong, Yu Jinsu, etc., as well as four security teams guarding the station and a police band playing music to send them off.

At 12 noon, he met with the newly appointed Director of Construction, Zhang Lisheng, at his private residence for a few minutes. Zhang resigned. Yu returned to Tianjin by car at 12:10 p.m. According to him, he has now reported and asked for instructions to Kong Huang, and since Kong will go to Tianjin immediately, he will rush back to welcome him first. After the provincial government was ordered to reorganize, all the closing matters have been completed. Except for Zheng Daoru, the newly appointed members of the committee and department directors have all been met. One member of the Provincial Committee is still missing. He has guaranteed the nomination of Lu查耀 (Lu Chaoyao) and Wang Tao, and the central government will choose one to appoint. Wei Jian is requested to serve as the secretary-general of the provincial government. The handover time of the various departments of the provincial government has not yet been determined. In the future, he will continue to work hard for the provincial government in accordance with the instructions of his superiors and the spirit of the past. The Tianjin Municipal Government is scheduled to implement the handover on the 16th. After the scope of the Ping Municipality is expanded, the two sides of the province and the city will discuss the matter together before it can be handled. The inside story of the assassination of Ji Hongchang and others at the Tianjin National Hotel is under strict investigation. Xu Jiyun, the person involved in the case, is of course highly suspected. (13th, Special Dispatch)</p>

During the meeting, De王 (De Wang, Prince De) reported on his visit to Chiang. At the end of the meeting, all the Mongolian people chanted "Long live Chairman Chiang!" The Mongolian people also played Mongolian music to express their condolences to him. When he left Bailingmiao, the Mongolian people formed a team to welcome him, extending several miles into the suburbs, which was truly touching. Bao Yueqing, the representative of the Mongolian Political Council in Ping, said that Yun王 (Yun Wang, Prince Yun) and De王 (De Wang, Prince De)'s meeting with Chiang will not lead to any more misunderstandings. It is also heard that the central government will send a special commissioner to reside in Bailingmiao to maintain contact.

<h3>Mourning Mr. Shi Liangcai, General Manager of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Liangcai, General Manager of this newspaper, was assassinated and killed on his way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. Alas, how tragic! The colleagues, in sudden shock upon hearing this sad news, reminisce about the past, having things that cannot be fully expressed in words and yet cannot but be expressed. We write briefly to offer our condolences.</p>
<p>Mr. Liangcai possessed great talent from a young age and studied new subjects in his youth. In a time when traditional imperial examinations had not yet been abolished, he was already studying the arts of acoustics, optics, chemistry, and electricity, disdaining the skills of petty craftsmanship. His thinking surpassed the ordinary, and he was unmatched by common men. If the people of the country could fully emulate him, how could the nation not achieve wealth and power? Mr. Shi has passed away. May we hold this statement to show the way forward.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi was skilled at handling worldly affairs. Matters of fame and fortune were as easy for him to obtain as picking up mustard seeds, but Mr. Shi disdained them. Knowing that the wealth and power of a country depend on the enlightenment of the people's wisdom, he dedicated himself to the cause of public opinion. He believed that only when public opinion can be promoted can politics be brought onto the right track. He faced all kinds of hardships with composure and remained steadfast for decades. To this day, this newspaper has received the love and support of society, thanks to Mr. Shi's efforts in promoting and enhancing it. In all things, dedication is essential to success. Mr. Shi was devoted to this for more than twenty years, not only for the success of the cause of public opinion but also as a standard of success for society. This spirit is truly admirable. May we share this lesson with those in the social enterprise.</p>
<p>People gather to form a society, and society forms a country. Therefore, those who aspire to serve the country should take the responsibilities of society as their own. Mr. Shi pondered deeply on this in his daily life and was aware of this. Therefore, at all times and in all places, he earnestly participated in all undertakings related to society, hoping to advance the country to a state of supreme order. He did not shy away from trivialities and eventually suffered from stomach ailments for more than ten years, yet he never slackened in the slightest. This is another example that the people of the country can emulate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Shi often cultivated himself through poetry and books in his daily life. It is only by nourishing one's spirit that one can overcome the complexities of the world. In his leisure time, he maintained a calm mind and did what his heart desired, advancing in learning and aspiring to the Tao. He never offended others and regarded the needs of others as his own responsibility. Those who discuss matters of principle do not need to be confined to the details of the Analects but rather focus on cultivating their own nature and spirit. Mr. Shi can be said to have attained the Way. He dealt with matters as if disentangling tangled silk threads and took the time to preserve his innate abilities. This kind of personal cultivation is especially admired by his colleagues. May we highlight this as a model for human ethics.</p>
<p>All these points cannot fully describe Mr. Shi's character, but his learning and cultivation lie in these aspects. With Mr. Shi's conduct and deeds, how could he have met with such an unexpected disaster? This is truly the most incomprehensible thing in the world. A great talent is destroyed, and a wise man withers. For the past twenty years, those who have served Mr. Shi through wind, rain, lamplight, and window light, how can they not be saddened and heartbroken upon hearing this sad news? May we express our sincerity to our readers.</p>

<h3>MacDonald Firmly Denies Secret Anglo-Japanese Contacts</h3>
<p>U.S. Side Believes Statement Clarifies Atmosphere</p>
<p>Still Believes Naval Negotiations Inevitable Rupture</p>
<p>London American sources have recently reported rumors that Britain and Japan are engaged in naval talks on the one hand and extremely secret economic and political activities on the other. Japan has made secret concessions to Britain on the [Manchukuo] and Japanese oil case, and the competition issue of Japanese textiles is currently under consideration, etc. British Prime Minister MacDonald firmly denied these rumors tonight, saying that all the proceedings between British and Japanese representatives are notified to the U.S. representatives at any time, and all the proceedings between U.S. and British representatives are also notified to the Japanese representatives at any time. There is no secret economic and political activity between Britain and Japan. British representatives have also not been asked to secretly or otherwise consider the proposal to concede on the [Manchukuo] and Japanese oil case. The textile industry negotiations between the British and Japanese governments have been suspended for several months. The U.S. naval negotiating delegation said that the Prime Minister's statement is very helpful in clarifying the atmosphere. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington U.S. naval authorities expect both the London talks and next year's naval conference to fail, and have already begun preparing a tentative plan to build new ships. U.S. officials do not believe Japan can accept the compromise proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald, that is, the U.S. and Britain recognize Japan's naval equality in principle, and Japan limits naval armaments with a "gentleman's agreement" style statement. Although Tokyo news said that Japanese officials expected the U.S. delegation to have other proposals, the Associated Press learned from reliable sources that the U.S. delegation to the London talks has no other proposals. As for the current Anglo-Japanese joint opposition to U.S. naval policy in London, U.S. officials expressed skepticism. Well-informed officials here said that the vastness of Britain's commercial scope in the Pacific and the complexity of Eastern politics and ethnic issues make the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance very difficult. The various rumors now in London are nothing more than British and Japanese representatives wanting to make the U.S. bear the responsibility for the breakdown of naval talks, but the breakdown of the talks is considered inevitable here.

<h3>The United States Expands Navy</h3>
<p>Building Two Large Airships</p>
<p>And One Aircraft Carrier</p>
<p>One New-Style Cruiser</p>
<p>Washington Wilson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, today proposed to the Aviation Committee to build two large airships to replace the Akron and Los Angeles, and to build a 15,000-ton aircraft carrier and a new-style cruiser with an aircraft deck. It is heard that this proposal has attracted great attention and has been supported by the Navy Department. The Aviation Committee will soon report to President Luo on the necessary steps to unify aviation policy. The U.S. airship Akron crashed in the Atlantic Ocean on April 4 last year due to thunderstorms, killing 73 people and only three survivors. The remaining one, the Los Angeles, was shipped to the United States from Germany in 1924. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, proposed today at the Federal Aviation Investigation Committee to build two large airships to replace the already destroyed Akron and Los Angeles. Secretary of the Navy Swanson also strongly urged the conference today to increase naval aviation strength. The secretary also said that the need to increase patrol aircraft and land bases is very urgent, so the next Congress should find a way to meet this need. Swanson and Vincent both oppose the merger of the Army and Navy air forces to form a separate aviation department. The two believe that the needs of the Navy and the Army are very different, so the merger of the two is unwise. (National News dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Naval Stalemate: Britain and Japan to Discuss Again Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Japan's Compromise Proposal to Britain</p>
<p>Yamamoto to Submit Alternative Proposal</p>
<p>The silent situation in the naval talks between Britain, the United States, and Japan in London may be broken within one or two days. British and Japanese representatives are expected to meet on Thursday to present the Japanese government's response to the British compromise proposal. The Japanese side's understanding of the British proposal has undergone several changes. At first, the Japanese in London viewed the British proposal, which in principle recognized Japanese naval equality, as confirming Japan's demands. However, after detailed study, they felt that the British proposal was too far from Japan's proposal, so they expected the Japanese government to reject it. Later, they thought that such action would be unwise. It is now heard that the Japanese government's response will contain another proposal. However, it is generally believed that the Japanese response will be presented by the chief Japanese delegate, Yamamoto, based solely on the authority he received when he left Japan. It is also heard that the Japanese government does not consider the British proposal fully satisfactory and that a response from Tokyo is necessary. However, in order to maintain the continuation of the talks and avoid Japan being held responsible for breaking them off, Yamamoto will make a diplomatic response, stating that this response does not come from Tokyo. It is generally believed that Japan's consideration of the British compromise proposal is a deliberate tactic to weaken American patience and make the American delegation ridiculed and forced to return home. However, according to American sources, the American representatives are not acting hastily. As long as any negotiations are still in progress, the American representatives do not want to leave here immediately. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Even if Naval Negotiations Fail, Britain and the United States Must Cooperate</h3>
<p>Concrete Expression of British Opinion</p>
<p>London: At a banquet of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, former South African Prime Minister General Smuts gave a speech, saying, "Rumors of imminent war are constantly circulating. It is important to know that such rumors create an atmosphere of war, which is more likely to cause war than anything else." Smuts also said that he had confidence in the current situation. He believed that the League of Nations should not become a military institution. Any attempt to turn the League of Nations into a system of using war to stop war is doomed to failure, because under such circumstances, the British Dominions cannot continue to participate in the League of Nations to be drawn into the wars of the Old World, etc. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>London: Former South African Prime Minister General Smuts gave a speech at a banquet of the Royal Institute of International Affairs yesterday, discussing the world war and the League of Nations, as reported in yesterday's telegram. Smuts's speech also had a passage that hit the nail on the head. It is supplemented as follows: "The future policy of the British Empire is based on cooperation with the United States, which is more important than cooperation with other countries." Today's Times published an article commenting that recently, rumors that Britain and Japan are about to re-establish an alliance have greatly shaken the United States. What General Smuts said is the best correction of this rumor. The newspaper also said that even if the naval talks fail, "our friendly and coordinated attitude towards the United States should not be abandoned. If we follow this path, we will never be wrong," etc. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Explains Saar Police Recruitment Issue</h3>
<p>Answering a Question from a Member of the House of Commons</p>
<p>Stating that Only Those Who Recommend Themselves are Provided with Assistance</p>
<p>The Government's Secret Selection is Not True</p>
<p>London: This morning's newspapers carried reports that the British government was secretly recruiting retired officers to be sent to the Saar region to strengthen the police force during the plebiscite. Today, members of the House of Commons questioned British Prime Minister MacDonald about this matter. The Prime Minister replied that the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in accordance with the resolution passed by the Administrative Council on June 4, notified the member states on September 3, requesting that they provide assistance to the Saar Governing Commission in recruiting police outside the Saar region to strengthen the Saar police force during the plebiscite. Some retired British officers wrote letters recommending themselves. The British government inquired about their qualifications and abilities, such as whether they had police experience and whether they could speak French and German, and then forwarded the self-recommendations of qualified candidates to the Saar Governing Commission. This is the truth. As for the claim that the outside world or the War Office is secretly recruiting soldiers, it is absolutely untrue. The Prime Minister continued to answer a question from opposition leader Lansbury, saying that the British government is not responsible for those who volunteer if accidents occur. The British government is only facilitating the contact between the volunteers and the Saar Governing Commission because it is one of the member states. He said that today, he knew that there were only about twenty retired officers from various countries who had volunteered to the Saar Governing Commission. This is not the latest number. It is found that of these twenty people, only two are British, and the rest are from other countries, etc. According to news from Saarbrucken, the Saar Governing Commission has also asked the people of the Saar not to engage in disputes anymore, and stated that the term "national traitor" will not be allowed in the future.

<h3>Pseudo-State Promulgates Petroleum Monopoly Law</h3>

Minerals other than petroleum products shall not be used to manufacture, import, or export petroleum products without government permission; 7. The government may, if it deems it necessary, order businesses dealing with petroleum products to report or order them to improve their equipment and other matters; 8. The date of implementation of this law shall be determined by the Minister of Finance. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Bonds Break 700 Million Yen</h3>
<p>Budget Issues Awaiting Prime Minister's Resolution</p>
<p>Military Hardline, Fujii Succumbs</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Finance has decided that the disaster budget of 175 million yen will be entirely financed by deficit government bonds. Therefore, the amount of deficit government bonds to be issued in the next fiscal year will naturally increase. If the military's request for revival is substantially approved, the amount of government bonds to be issued will inevitably increase. The draft assessment for the next fiscal year attached to the budget cabinet meeting has a government bond issuance of 604 million yen, plus 56 million yen for the disaster budget for the tenth year and a minimum of 50 million yen for the approval of the revival request, which will break 700 million yen. Therefore, the policy of reducing government bond issuance and restoring fiscal balance, which Finance Minister Fujii initially strongly advocated, has been completely violated. Therefore, pessimistic views on the future of Fujii's finances have become increasingly strong recently. (Dentsu dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The government held only one cabinet meeting on the next year's budget. The regular cabinet meeting on the 9th did not discuss the budget issue, and entered the period of the army's grand exercises. Prime Minister Okada and other cabinet members went to the exercise site to observe the exercises. Therefore, the negotiations between the central ministries and the Ministry of Finance were carried out by the administrative authorities. In view of the current international situation, Ministers Hayashi and Osumi insisted on the army's budget implementation policy. Finance Minister Fujii also maintained the policy of gradually reducing deficit government bonds from the position of the financial authorities. The conflict of opinions must be resolved by Prime Minister Okada. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: As a result of the meeting held by the Ministry of Finance yesterday, the disaster budget of 175 million yen was approved, an increase of 75 million yen compared to the initial policy. Finance Minister Fujii was criticized by the world for issues such as tax increases, which will become a problem in the extraordinary parliament. Therefore, in order to restore credibility, the increased amount was approved. Based on the policy of reducing deficit government bonds, the Minister of Finance included the rural civil engineering fees and medical relief fees, which were requested to be revived by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Home Affairs, in the disaster budget for approval. The disaster budget for the ninth year of Showa is 70 million yen, and for the tenth year, it is 55 million yen. Although there is a tendency to decrease on the surface, this is only a nominal decrease, and the actual finances will not strengthen its content by this method. Moreover, Finance Minister Fujii showed a yielding attitude towards the hardline attitude of the military, and his so-called sound financial policy was ineffective. (Dentsu dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Rumor of Secret Aviation Agreement Signed by Britain, France, and Belgium</h3>
<p>British Defense Front Line Extends to the Rhine River</p>
<p>London and Paris Deny It</p>
<p>Paris: According to a report from the Paris Midi newspaper's special correspondent in England, the general staffs of France, Britain, and Belgium have concluded an extremely important agreement, whose name in diplomatic documents is the "Military Information Exchange Agreement." The special correspondent recently visited London to investigate the latest developments in the British Air Force. According to the reporter, the Dutch General Staff was also invited to participate, but ultimately did not join. This agreement was originally proposed by the late French Foreign Minister Barthou, and was later finalized by French General Weygand after discussions with the British General Staff. Furthermore, according to the agreement, the British defense front line has indeed been extended to the Rhine River. Therefore, in times of war, British aircraft can take off immediately and gather at airfields in Belgium and France within 24 hours to begin work directly. It is said that this is the most appropriate strategy for Britain to defend its borders and prevent enemy aircraft from attacking the British mainland. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>London: News has been published in the press that the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium have signed a secret aviation agreement. Well-informed sources here have officially denied it, saying that such an important agreement can only be the responsibility of the government, and cannot be carried out solely by the military authorities. Therefore, this statement has no basis. Responsible persons in Paris have also officially denied it in the same way. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

In addition, Foreign Minister Laval and Ambassador Chambrun discussed the issue of rapprochement between France and Italy. This matter is currently being negotiated, and Laval's visit to Rome will also be for this reason. Yesterday's meeting discussed the extent to which the negotiations have progressed.

<h3>U.S. Treasury Department Explicitly Revokes Restrictions on Capital Exports</h3>
<p>Future Monetary Policy Provides Strong Guarantee</p>
<p>No More Fear of Currency Inflation</p>
<p>London Silver Market Seethes with Excitement</p>
<p>Washington: The Treasury Department today revoked restrictions on capital exports. Treasury officials stated that this action is a result of progress in the world financial situation and that the danger of the American people losing money due to the government's monetary policy has also passed. People here believe that this action is a strong guarantee of the government's future monetary policy, indicating that there is no more fear of currency inflation and that the government is confident that the inflation movement in the next Congress will be difficult to succeed. The Treasury Department has now formally announced that currency and capital can be exported from the United States without government approval. Any American citizen can transport currency or transfer credit to any country, canceling all restrictions for a year and a half. The only items that cannot be freely exported are Treasury bills and cash. However, if the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar falls below the export gold price, gold bars can also be exported at any time. Treasury officials explained that the only restriction the government now retains is a reporting system, so that the Treasury Department can audit the total amount of capital outflow. The original text of the order is as follows:</p>
<p>"All transfers of credit and exports of currency (except for Treasury bills) and silver coins are hereby authorized." However, the government may change this if it believes that it is necessary to limit these exports again. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued an order today to eliminate all obstacles to foreign exchange. In the future, those who ship American currency for export to purchase securities will not need to obtain a special license. In fact, although such a license is required, the Treasury Department never made it difficult and always approved it. However, it was only explicitly revoked today. At the same time, according to official sources, the Treasury Department purchased a total of 108,891,490 ounces under the Silver Nationalization Act in the week ending November 9. The deadline for submitting silver was November 7, in other words, 90 days after the Silver Nationalization Act was promulgated on August 9. A total of 16,998,000 ounces of new mine silver purchased under the executive order of last December have now been reached, of which 259,428 ounces were received in the week ending November 9. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>New York, London, and Montreal: Silver prices in both places surged today. Observers here believe that this is the result of the U.S. government's continued silver purchasing policy. It is rumored here that the Treasury Department is actively operating on the Montreal Exchange, because the Chinese government is levying silver export taxes and the supply of Mexican silver is very limited. The Treasury Department recently purchased silver directly from Mexico. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

This afternoon, British Major Minister Eden, at the request of the German Embassy in London, met with Ribbentrop at the Foreign Office for three quarters of an hour. According to official sources, Ribbentrop did not put forward any new proposals, so the negotiations did not produce any new developments. After the meeting, a Reuters reporter visited Ribbentrop and asked about the rumor that Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference were being discussed, with the cancellation of the military provisions in the Treaty of Versailles as a condition. Ribbentrop replied that he did not know about this rumor and that it was probably just a fantasy. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Northwest Inspection Notes</p>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya of this Newspaper</p>
<p>From the Rural Economy of Dunhuang to the System of Allocating Funds to Various Counties</p>
<p>Dunhuang was one of the four counties in Hexi during the Han Dynasty, leading six counties. Dunhuang was the first county of the prefecture. The name Dunhuang originally had the meaning of "great prosperity." Later, because of the Mingsha Mountain in the area, it was also called Shazhou. In the early years of the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, it was disturbed by the Tubo people, and all the people moved inland. During the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, people from the inland were moved again to populate it. The city relies on the east bank of the Dang River, with a circumference of six hundred zhang and a height of nineteen chi. It faces Yangguan in the front and Yumen in the back, controlling Yiwu and restraining Mobei. It is the throat of the entire Long and the key to the extreme border.</p>
<p>The border extends to Tianshui Well, 140 li, west to the Xinjiang border, 1,900 li, south to Aluchaidan, connecting the Mongolian nomadic area, 570 li, and north to the Hami border, 400+ li. The area is approximately 300,000 square li (there is no accurate statistics, according to the county government's survey, it should be at least 180,000 square li or more). The total cultivated land in the county is 116,940 mu, and the wasteland that can still be reclaimed is approximately 50,000 mu or more, excluding the water-deficient Gobi. There are currently more than 2,300 households, with a population of approximately 20,000, of which farmers account for 1,850 households, totaling 18,000 people. Landlords account for 55% of all farming households, self-cultivating farmers account for 10%, semi-self-cultivating farmers account for 15%, and tenant farmers account for 20%. On average, each person can be allocated approximately six to seven mu of land based on the current population and cultivated land. The average annual grain production is approximately 1,000+ shi, and the people's food supply is gradually feeling inadequate.</p>
<p>Most of the farming households moved from various counties in Gansu during the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty. Each household was given one fen of land, approximately 50 to 60 mu. Therefore, today, when referring to land, it is called one fen, or one household. When referring to five li of land or two and a half li of land, each accounts for approximately 25 mu or 12 to 13 mu. In the early years of the Republic of China, the county had a total of 117,159 mu of land, of which 2,812 mu are barren and uncultivated to this day. The reasons for the barrenness are: First, the Dang River floods, inundating more than 300 mu; second, families die out, with no one to cultivate; third, families flee due to the turmoil of soldiers and bandits and heavy labor, seeking refuge in Xinjiang, a trend that has been continuous for the past five years; fourth, many adult male farmers have been conscripted into the army, which is also a matter of the past five years.</p>
<p>During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, there were many commercial firms, and the area was originally very wealthy. This was because the gold mines were developed at that time, with more than 5,000 gold miners, and the annual gold tax collected was nearly 400 taels. Later, it gradually decreased. Since the Republic of China, the mining industry has greatly declined, because people mostly tend to grow opium. There are many who grow opium, and there are also many who smoke it. The more they smoke, the lazier they become, and the lazier they become, the poorer they become. In recent years, due to the relationship between soldiers and bandits, the burden on farmers has increased, and the rural economy has become increasingly bankrupt, resulting in all the gold mines in the seventy-two gold gullies being unattended. Last year, Yang Can (from Yixing, who taught in Lanzhou for many years and has a good reputation) came to govern this county. After getting off the car, he took the lead in revitalizing the gold mines, borrowing food rations from the people, and encouraging about 40 to 50 people to go gold panning. However, according to the gold miners, they are very afraid of soldiers and forced collection of gold taxes, so most of them dare not go. The gold gullies are close to the Qinghai border. Last year, the Qinghai province sent many soldiers to investigate and collect gold taxes. Although they did not collect much, the gold miners still harbored lingering fears, and it is still difficult to expect them to prosper.</p>
<p>Gansu Province is full of guest troops, and it is difficult to supply them. As a last resort, the people are allowed to grow opium and collect fines to pay for military expenses. Every spring, before the opium is sown, opium taxes are collected. The county government must plan ahead and pre-allocate taxes. This opium tax has always been allocated to various counties by the Opium Prohibition Committee and the Finance Department. The numbers are sent to the Pacification Commissioner's Office and distributed to various armies, which directly send personnel to various counties to collect them. Military needs are urgent and cannot be delayed. The county magistrate then allocates and collects taxes from various districts for delivery. The upper-middle class can still pay, but the poor households cannot cope and have to turn to wealthy households and merchants to beg for loans. Without mentioning the interest rate, they only talk about how many taels of soil to pay. Usually, one yuan is borrowed, and when the new opium is harvested, at least six taels of soil, and at most eight taels of soil, must be paid, regardless of the opium price. The average yield of opium per mu is less than 50 taels, while the tax is more than ten yuan, plus labor costs of four to five yuan, totaling seventeen to eighteen yuan. The price of opium is only 30 yuan per hundred taels, so the income per mu is only worth 15 yuan. Those with their own capital still have to lose two to three yuan. The most fortunate opium farmers (such as those with a uniquely rich harvest and a higher selling price) can only barely cover their costs. If they borrow money to repay with opium, they only get seven to eight yuan per mu, which is about half of the opium tax and labor costs. From then on, they become more and more burdened, more and more indebted, and their lives become unbearable.</p>
<p>The military expenses allocated by the provincial government are continuous every month. Before the opium seedlings are one foot tall, the tax per mu has been allocated. Taxes are allocated every month and urged every day. The county magistrate and the township chiefs in each district are always busy urging taxes, and the farmers are always in a hurry to pay taxes. Government affairs are neglected, farming is delayed, and the rural economy is bankrupt. All of this is due to this. Because the farmers are poor, the county government borrows one yuan in the spring and repays seven to eight taels of soil in the summer, which is unbearable. It has presented a request to the Opium Prohibition Committee to reduce the military expenses allocated in the slack season and reallocate them in July and August to avoid burdening the farmers and provide relief to the people. However, military expenses are urgent, and the province cannot approve it. Therefore, most farmers still have to borrow money to pay taxes as soon as possible. When the opium is harvested, the creditors gather on the field, holding scales to demand repayment, or even snatching the opium sap, resulting in fights and lawsuits frequently occurring. In such a situation, how can the county magistrates have time to talk about rural relief and local construction?</p>
<p>The system of allocating funds in Gansu Province began in the 19th year of the Republic of China. The income of various counties and bureaus is mostly directly collected by various armies, often exceeding the quota. The county bureaus cannot cope and request a change of allocation, but it is not approved. The collectors use this as an excuse to make things difficult for the county bureaus in many ways. The county bureaus, as a last resort, have asked the province for instructions on how to raise funds when the funds have been over-allocated. The province also cannot solve the problem and mostly ignores it. Moreover, the travel expenses of the collectors and other supplies must be borne by the local government, which is quite a lot of money. When the reporter interviewed Chairman Zhu in Lanzhou, he heard that Zhu had a proposal to abolish the allocation of funds. The shortcomings of the allocation system have long been observed by the authorities. Now, after actual inspections in various places, it is indeed felt that if this system is extended, the suffering of the people will deepen day by day. It is hoped that the finances of Gansu Province will be as expected by Zhu, and that the central government will quickly provide assistance for unified collection and unified expenditure, so that the allocation system can be abolished as soon as possible, and the county bureaus can be spared from being overwhelmed, and not only can the people breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

<h3>The East Route Army Joins Forces in the Pseudo-Capital Ruijin</h3>
<p>A Retrospective of the Five Encirclement Campaigns</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Ruijin is located in the southeastern part of Jiangxi Province on the border of Fujian, connected to Shicheng and Ningdu in the north, parallel to Guangdong in the west, accessible to Guangdong via Huichang in the south, and interdependent with Changmen in the east. Since Zhu Mao abandoned their old base in Jinggangshan in the 18th year of the Republic of China, they entered Fujian along the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong, disturbed Wuping and Shanghang, and captured Tingzhou. Ruijin also fell into the hands of the bandits. When Donggu was defeated by the National Army, the bandits considered Ruijin to be located in the center of southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, in the bandit area, which was quite suitable, so they designated it as the pseudo-capital and held a pseudo-national representative conference to establish the pseudo-Chinese Soviet government there. It became the center for commanding the Communist bandits and issuing orders. The pseudo-Central Party Department, the pseudo-government, the pseudo-Military Commission, the pseudo-Red Army School, and the pseudo-arsenal had everything they needed, hence the name Little Moscow. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek supervised the armies of five provinces, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Guangxi, divided into east, west, north, and south, and launched the fifth encirclement campaign to aim at joining forces in Ruijin to eradicate the bandits' lair. The bandits either avoided the real and went for the virtual, or defended to the death, or fled in all directions, all aiming at consolidating the pseudo-center. Since the National Army began the encirclement campaign last year, the bandit areas in eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian have been completely recovered. The armies of the northeast routes approached the heart of the bandits. At that time, the bandits in the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian border area considered the gateways to Ruijin to be Shicheng and Changting. The danger of Shicheng lies in Xueheling, and the danger of Changting lies in the Longyan border area, so they deployed the most elite pseudo-1st, 3rd, 5th, and 9th Army Corps there and constructed crisscrossing fortifications in order to resist stubbornly. At the same time, a part of the pseudo-7th and 9th Army Corps of Luo Binghui and Fang Zhimin was used to disturb Anhui and Zhejiang, and the 17th and 18th Divisions of Xiao Ke's pseudo-6th Army Corps were used to flee to Hunan and Sichuan, in an attempt to disperse the encirclement forces. They were intercepted by the Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou armies along the way, until Shiting fell, Ruijin had no danger to defend. Zhu Mao then convened a pseudo-central conference and decided to abandon the pseudo-central area, concentrating the pseudo-1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Army Corps to flee west. All the leading organs of the pseudo-center moved west, and the bandit leaders from Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Xiang Ying, Bogu, Zhang Wentian, and Li De, down to the lower-level cadres, all fled for their lives. On the 20th of last month, they broke through the XinFeng-Nankang-Dayu line from Yudu, plundered Chongyi, Shangyou, and Renhua on the border of Guangdong to enter Rucheng and Guidong in Hunan, hoping to flee to the border area of Sichuan and Guizhou, while the bandits left to guard the border of Jiangxi and Fujian were nothing more than pseudo-local independent regimental guerrilla teams and local scattered bandits. Earlier, when the East Route Army captured Tingzhou, Li Moan's division advanced west through Gucheng and went straight to Ruijin City. Song Xilian's division came out of the south of Ruijin to cut off the connection between the bandits in Yudu and Huichang and cut off the bandits' escape route to the south. Another three-way army that captured Shicheng went straight to Ruibei to provide support. Li's division only encountered scattered bandits along the way after passing Gucheng and proceeded smoothly. At 10:30 AM on the 10th of this month, it stationed in Ruijin City. Song's division also reached Tiaomijie in the south of Ruijin, and the scattered bandits fled south to Yudu and Huichang, and are being pursued. However, Ruijin has been occupied by the bandits as a pseudo-capital for six years, and the degree of redification is unmatched in the country. When the National Army entered the city, only a small number of old, weak, and civilians remained. All the pseudo-organs were empty and deserted, desolate and sad, like a dead city. However, the reactionary slogans were everywhere. After the National Army entered the city, it immediately issued a proclamation to civilize the people. Only a few remaining bandits were scattered in Yudu, Huichang, Ninghua, and Qingliu, and they can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Since He Long and Ye Ting rebelled in Nanchang in the 16th year of the Republic of China, Jiangxi Province has been immersed in the fiery red disaster. The southeastern half of the country, as well as Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Sichuan, were also filled with banditry. National strength and popular support were both damaged. However, since the 19th year of the Republic of China, it has been the military center for suppressing the Red Army. The central government used all its energy to quell the chaos and pacify the interior. The five encirclement campaigns were: the Donggu campaign from the summer to December of the 19th year was the first; the Guangchang campaign from March of the 20th year was the second; the campaign from recovering Ningdu and Yudu to the Gaoxingxu campaign was quite successful, but it was abandoned due to the September 18th Incident, which was the third; the fourth encirclement campaign was launched in the second half of the 21st year and ended in March of the 22nd year, when the bandits took advantage of the National Army's 52nd and 59th Divisions being concentrated in Jiaohu and attacked from Yihuang to the south, and the entire line was restrained. Therefore, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek rigorously trained the cadres of the bandit suppression army in Lushan. The fifth encirclement campaign began in early October of the 22nd year. In addition to military affairs, he also paid great attention to political aftermath, which led to today's success. The recovery of Ruijin is a major field for clearing the Communist bandits and stabilizing the interior. Southern Jiangxi, which has been the most deeply affected by banditry, has since entered a period of clearing bandits and dealing with the aftermath. However, a part of the main force of the bandits still fled to the border of Hunan, and the center of gravity of bandit suppression has shifted from Jiangxi to the border of Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou. The tasks of this province in the future are: one is to devote all efforts to clearing the scattered bandits and dealing with the aftermath, and the other is to pursue the bandits with all efforts, uniting the armies of Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan to eliminate Zhu Mao and Xu He. Only then can the task of bandit suppression be completely completed. (November 11)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Changes Money and Grain to Land Tax</h3>
<p>Temporary Land Tax Collection Offices Established in Various Counties</p>
<p>Land Evaluation Personnel Have Been Appointed Successively</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The investigation of fields and acres in various counties and cities in Guangdong Province will be completed soon. Those that have been completed will set up a field and acre evaluation committee to evaluate the value, and then change to levy temporary land tax according to the value, and cancel the old system of money and grain. At present, more than ten counties have started to change to levy temporary land tax. The Department of Finance has specially formulated the organizational measures for the temporary land tax collection offices in various counties, which will be promulgated to various counties for compliance, so as to establish offices and collect taxes on a certain date. The organizational measures for the temporary land tax offices in various counties are summarized as follows: 1. The collection office is established when the temporary land tax is levied. 2. The personnel in charge of the collection office are divided into two types, director or collector, depending on the complexity of the affairs, with clerks, assistants, and inspectors assisting them. 3. All staff members of the director or collector are appointed by the Department of Finance and handle tax collection affairs under the leadership of the director of the county finance bureau and under the command and supervision of the county magistrate. 4. The staff members of the sub-offices in each district are appointed by the county government and reported to the Department of Finance for record. They handle tax collection affairs under the leadership of the director or collector of the county collection office and under the command and supervision of the director of the county finance bureau. 5. The number and expenses of the collectors are specified in another table. 6. The expenses of the collection office and sub-offices are paid monthly by the county government from the income of the temporary land tax. 7. The temporary land tax receipts used by the collection office should be prepared by the county with the paper price and led by the Department of Finance, stamped with a seal, and handed over to the collection office for safekeeping, and distributed to various sub-offices for collection. 8. The tax collected by each sub-office should be paid to the county in a package together with the temporary land tax receipts, and the two copies should be handed over to the county collection office for verification and transfer. 9. The tax collected by the collection office from each sub-office should be paid to the county treasury for verification and collection every day or every three days, and at the latest no more than five days. As for the copy of the receipt handed over to the county for verification, the director or collector of the collection office should ask the director of the finance bureau to verify and approve how to hand it over to the county for verification after verification by the collection office according to the number. (Omitted) Before the Department of Finance organizes the change of money and grain to land tax throughout the province, it first sets up a land tax collector training class. Those who pass the training period and pass the oral test are sent to various counties to handle the collection of land tax. Yesterday, more than ten students who completed the second training period have been sent to various counties to serve as members of the county field and acre evaluation committee and district evaluation members.

<h3>National Government Orders the Legislative Yuan to Amend Chapter 3 of the Stamp Tax Law</h3>
<p>Beijing News: On the 9th, the National Government instructed the Legislative Yuan to amend Chapter 3 of the Stamp Tax Law. The original order said:</p>
<p>For the matter of issuing an order, the Central Political Conference approved on November 3, 23rd year a letter from the Secretariat of this Conference stating, "According to a letter from the Executive Yuan, "According to a letter from the Ministry of Finance, "It is found that the Stamp Tax Law has been amended and passed by the Legislative Yuan. Article 18 of Chapter 3 of the original law stipulates, "Those who violate the provisions of Articles 5 to 10 by not affixing stamp tax tickets shall be fined ten to thirty times the amount of tax payable, depending on the circumstances. When the amount affixed is less than the fixed amount, the penalty shall be reduced by half." Article 20 also stipulates, "Those who violate the provisions of this law in two or more cases shall be fined according to the provisions of Article 18, but the combined penalty shall not exceed three times the amount of the most serious case." and so on. This penalty method is very different from the one stipulated in the original draft submitted by this Ministry. When this Ministry drafted the draft, the penalty rules were initially based on the practice of other taxes, and the penalty was imposed according to a certain multiple of the tax payable. After repeated research, it was found that the stamp tax is the smallest amount and the easiest to conceal. It is difficult to impose penalties according to the multiple of the tax amount, so a fixed-amount penalty method is adopted in order to avoid abuses. The people of all countries have long developed the habit of affixing stamps, and the stamp tax laws of all countries also stipulate heavier penalties. My country has been holding it for nearly 20 years. Even with the severity of the penalties in the current regulations, merchants in large cities still often conceal and omit them. The situation in other places is even more conceivable. Moreover, the fixed-amount penalty rules stipulated in the draft prepared by this Ministry have already been reduced a lot compared with those stipulated in the current regulations. The penalty rules now amended and passed by the Legislative Yuan only impose a fine of ten to thirty times the tax payable. This Ministry believes that it is necessary to request an amendment, and the reasons are as follows: 1. The various certificates stipulated in the Stamp Tax Law, such as invoices, bills, and money receipts, are the most common, and the stamp tax paid on these three items is the largest. Although the current regulations stipulate that those who omit to affix stamps shall be fined at least 10 yuan per piece, merchants mostly discard the above-mentioned invoices that are accepted at any time, and it is extremely difficult to save and check them. Therefore, there are also many who conceal and omit them. Now, it is only stipulated that those who conceal and omit them shall be fined ten to thirty times the amount of tax payable, and the combined amount of the penalty shall not exceed three times the amount of the most recent case. If one calculates the most serious fine amount for omitting to affix a single ticket of less than ten yuan, which omits to affix one cent of stamp, the amount is only 3 jiao. If one simultaneously has one hundred or ten tickets omitting to affix one hundred or ten cents of stamp, the combined fine amount is only nine jiao. I am afraid that merchants will think that they do not affix stamps to the above-mentioned single tickets. Even if they are completely seized and penalized, the fines paid are not as much as the stamp tax paid in one day. Where there is a profit, they will uniformly not affix stamps and be willing to be penalized. The number is also limited. This level must be considered. 2. Whether stamp tax tickets sell well and whether the reporting and inspection are effective are also greatly related to the amount of fines charged for rewards. At present, the execution of inspection matters is concurrently handled by the levying agency. The original budget of the collecting agencies, and the extraction of fines is only slightly to subsidize office expenses and to reward inspection personnel. Therefore, the amount of fines is not a major issue. However, from November 1 of this year, stamp tax tickets will be sold on consignment by the post office, and there is no mandatory nature. It relies entirely on the strict inspection of the governments of various cities and counties and the timely reporting of the people to ensure tax revenue. If the fines are too light, in addition to the judicial organs deducting 60% according to regulations, the amount of the share that the informers and the inspection personnel of the governments of various cities and counties can extract for rewards will be even smaller. There will even be insufficient funds for inspection matters, and everyone will be indifferent. In the concession area of the sea, the matter is concurrently handled by the cigarette investigation team attached to the Bureau of Works. If the extraction of fines is not as good as the current one, then the Chinese and Western investigators of the team will also not be as serious as when watching the situation. The impact on tax revenue is unpredictable. Based on the above reasons, it seems more beneficial to tax revenue to maintain the penalty regulations stipulated in the original draft prepared by this Ministry. If it is necessary to impose a penalty according to the multiple of the tax payable to be fair, then one should also follow the Japanese tax law (Article 11 of the Japanese Tax Law (omitted) But when the amount of tax evasion is less than 3 yuan, a penalty of 3 yuan will be imposed. Article 14: Those who violate this law shall not apply the example of criminal law (omitted) combined trial (omitted)). It is stipulated that when the fine imposed according to the multiple of the tax amount is less than 5 yuan, a penalty of 5 yuan should be imposed. If there are two or more cases, a penalty should still be imposed on each case, and the method of combined penalty should not be applied to provide relief. It is reasonable to prepare a document and present it to your Yuan for transfer to the Central Political Conference in accordance with Article 5 of the Legislative Procedure Outline (passed by the Legislative Yuan meeting), "When the Central Political Conference believes that it is necessary to amend a bill before it is promulgated by the National Government, it may issue a resolution and send it to the Legislative Yuan for amendment (of the regulations, the original Stamp Tax Law that was passed should be sent to the Legislative Yuan for amendment of Chapter 3 to facilitate implementation and maintain tax revenue)." and so on. After deliberation, it was submitted to the 184th meeting of this Yuan and resolved to be passed. In addition to issuing an order and requesting the National Government to postpone the promulgation of the law, a corresponding letter is hereby requested to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for investigation and amendment, etc. Based on this, it should be handled accordingly. In addition to replying in a letter, it is hereby ordered that your Yuan comply with and handle this order.</p>

<h3>Nanchang Headquarters Issues Order to Severely Punish Drug Offenders</h3>
<p>Drug Offenders Refuse to Appear in Court and Cannot Be Arrested</p>
<p>Properties Will Be Confiscated and Warrants Issued for Their Arrest</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since Chairman Chiang issued an order to all parts of the country to ban opium within a specified time, anti-smoking work in various provinces has become increasingly tense. Yesterday, the Nanchang Headquarters, based on a report from Fang Ce, the Administrative Inspector of the Third District of Henan, issued another order to the provinces, stating that drug offenders who manufacture, transport, sell, or peddle drugs may be ordered by the military law agencies under their jurisdiction to appear in court within a set time limit. If they refuse to appear and cannot be arrested, the Headquarters may approve the confiscation of their property and issue warrants for their arrest and prosecution. The original order is transcribed below: According to the report from Fang Ce, the Administrative Inspector of the Third District of Henan, [It has been found that various regulations and rules have been issued repeatedly to strictly prohibit potent drugs, and all types of drug offenders who manufacture, transport, sell, or peddle drugs are subject to the death penalty without any leniency. The original intention was to warn those who heard and shock those who saw, and although the legislation is strict, the spirit of the legislation is to promote their awareness and initiate their self-renewal, in order to achieve the goal of eradicating the poisonous atmosphere. However, it has been found that these drug offenders mostly possess large amounts of capital and use money to absorb accomplices to act as their eyes and ears. Whenever military police search, if there are few soldiers, they lead their gangs to resist arrest, and if there are many soldiers, they flee at the first sign of trouble. Moreover, the largest drug dens are scattered and hidden in places such as Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou, using concessions as protective charms. Although local officials clearly know that their crimes are heinous and should be punished severely, they are like birds flying into the dark and cannot be arrested. Therefore, the more serious the crime, the more wealth they accumulate, and the more difficult it is to arrest them. If this continues and they are allowed to remain at large, the future of the ban will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, for all drug offenders who manufacture, transport, sell, or peddle drugs, if their names are known far and wide and their crimes are obvious, it is proposed that the military law agencies under their jurisdiction order them to appear in court within a set time limit. If they fail to report on time or fail to state a valid reason for their failure to do so, their private property will be sealed up, and they will be ordered to surrender themselves within a set time limit. If they still fail to appear, their property will be confiscated and rewards will be given according to regulations, and warrants will be issued for their arrest and prosecution, so that even the biggest culprits who escape the net will still be subject to legal sanctions. Is this feasible? It is hereby submitted for review and approval]. It is noted that although there is no explicit provision in the Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs regarding whether the private property of persons who manufacture and transport drugs should be confiscated, it is clearly stipulated in Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Regulations on Strictly Investigating and Prohibiting Narcotic Drugs and Eliminating Soil Ointment Shops promulgated by the headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. All provinces that implement these regulations should still comply with these regulations before the Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs are revised and supplemented. The request in the original report does not conflict with the provisions of these regulations, provided that it is limited to those whose crimes are confirmed, who refuse to appear in court, and who cannot be arrested, and must be submitted to this headquarters for approval before execution, in order to show caution and avoid abuses. In addition to informing and distributing this to various departments, you are hereby ordered to be informed and to instruct your subordinates to comply with this order.

<h3>Major Criminals Who Escaped Convicted and Sentenced</h3>
<p>In March of this year, the home of Huan'an Zhang Siqi was robbed, resulting in significant losses. The case was reported to the naval, army, and police agencies for investigation. Later, the police in this city discovered suspicious activity in a house rented by Huang Yonggen, resided in by a Shi family, near Aijia Bridge, with many people entering and exiting. A search was conducted, resulting in the capture of a suspect named Quan Zichang, along with a handgun and stolen goods. However, Huang Yonggen was not captured as he was away. Quan and the stolen goods were sent to the court for interrogation, sentenced to imprisonment, and sent to prison for execution. Huang Yonggen, who had escaped, was spotted by patrol officer Fei Gonghuo of the water patrol team in May of this year, while patrolling the east gate of Jinshanwei. He was arrested, sent to Songjiang, and handed over to the county court. After a thorough investigation, he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year and six months by the criminal court this afternoon (13th).</p>

<h3>Robbery of Eight Families in Hengjing Township</h3>
<p>(Changshu Correspondence) Hengjing Township in the Eighth District, located on the shores of Yangcheng Lake, was struck by a gang of more than thirty bandits in Yeyahu Village, Yanghao Township, in the afternoon of the 10th of this month. Armed with weapons, they infiltrated the village. At a prearranged signal, the bandits struck, catching the villagers unprepared. Seeing the firearms, the villagers dared not resist. As a result, they were robbed for two hours, with Wang Dabang, Gu Junqing, Ji Agui, Tang Liu, Gu Zhongfu, Gu Laopei, Gu Ada, and others from seven families suffering losses totaling approximately two thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>Major Robberies Occur in Urban and Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Zhou Suwen, at number 206 Lower Pond Street inside Chang Gate, operates Yongming Laogongmao, Bailitai Gongyu, and other insurance businesses and lives a relatively wealthy life. Unfortunately, he was targeted by bandits. At 5:30 PM on the 12th, seven bandits suddenly appeared at the back door of the Zhou family in Wu Jing Temple Lane. They knocked on the door, and a male servant, unaware that they were bandits, opened the door. The bandits rushed in, cut the telephone line, displayed fake handguns, and herded the seven male and female servants into the side room. Two bandits guarded the door downstairs, while five bandits went upstairs and looted at will for about half an hour before fleeing with the loot. The stolen jewelry and cash are estimated to be worth more than three thousand yuan. At around 6:00 PM, the victim reported the incident to the Fifth Precinct of the First Public Security Bureau. Inspector Tang Jinfang went to investigate and reported to the Public Security Bureau, and dispatched telegrams to the Detective Team and the city gates to capture the bandits. Subsequently, the detective agency dispatched plainclothes detectives, disguised as civilians, to lie in wait near the train station. They soon captured four suspicious-looking travelers, male and female, young and old, on the train. The victim identified them as the perpetrators and they were taken to the police station. According to one of them, Ji Dayin, and another, Qian Dehua, as well as Zuo Dingshi (also known as Qian Dingshi), a large number of gold and silver jewelry was found on Zuo Dingshi. They were immediately sent to the First Precinct. Two other suspects, Zhang Hongjiang and Yu Zizhen, were captured at the Pingmen Gate, and items such as gold watches were seized. They were also taken to the First Precinct. According to Zuo Dingshi, she was from Jurong and living with her lover Qian Dehua on Nanhua Street. The items belonged to a short, stout man who asked her to take them to Shanghai. They had planned the robbery with six people, and they had eaten at her house that day. The Zhou family's robbery was the brainchild of the short, stout Ji Dayin and his father, Yougen (who is on the run). There were two guns, and after the robbery, they went to her house and asked her to keep the guns safe. The other suspects' confessions were inconsistent. That night, four people, Wei Fangguo, Wei Wangshi, the landlord Ding Zisheng, and Zhu Dianfu, were arrested at number 159 and a half Nanhua Street. Two fake handguns, four stolen new transportation banknotes, and twenty-three yuan and forty cents in Chinese currency were seized. They were taken to the First Precinct and sent to the Detective Team for questioning yesterday. In Huangdai Township, Tianda Bay, Henan Village, Hebei Village, Xinkaihe Village, and Baijiawan four villages, more than twenty bandits arrived the night before last, and robbed Zou Haiquan, Zou Yuansun, Zhou Dadao, Shi Heshang, Zhang Shigao, Gu Songhe, Yu Shuigen, Yu Alin, Yu Qiaosheng, Yu Shanliang and twelve other families, suffering losses of about one million yuan. The bandits fled towards the Caohe area.</p>

<h3>Fire at Bai Shu Alley</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiaodi, a resident of number 29 Luhua Alley outside the North Gate of this county, runs a clothing shop and has some savings. He has two sons. At 1:30 PM on the 12th, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Zhu family's house. Thick smoke billowed and flames rose, piercing the roof. The Xishan News Agency, upon hearing the alarm, immediately sounded the gong to raise the alarm. The fire was fierce, and the fire brigades from North One, North Two, North Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, North Nine, and Northeast One rushed to the scene to put out the fire. Their efforts were effective, and the fire was extinguished after about half an hour. However, one front building was completely destroyed. The Wuxi branch of the Shanghai Shen Bao and the Shishi Xinbao branch were located right next to the Zhu family's house. When the fire was raging, Wu Zihui, the head of the branch, was extremely anxious. Fortunately, the walls were high and strong, and they were not affected, but they were still frightened. As for the cause of the fire, one theory is that a naughty child set fire to some cotton, and it could not be put out in time. However, according to the Zhu family, there were no children upstairs, and it was probably an electrical fire. The total loss is estimated at five to six hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Joint Defense Implemented in Five Joint Defense Zones</h3>

<h3>More Than a Thousand Salt Workers Petition with Incense</h3>
<p>The residents of the Fang, Su, Bao, and Zheng embankments in the western countryside of Zhapu all make a living by producing brine and boiling salt. Recently, due to the decline of the rural economy and poor harvests, they have been suffering greatly. Furthermore, salt workers selling salt to salt storehouses receive only about one yuan and forty-five cents per load, which is about the same as their own costs, making it impossible to maintain a livelihood. The morning before last, more than a thousand salt workers, men, women, old, and young, marched into the city in formation, holding incense and candles, to petition the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Weighing and Releasing General Bureau, requesting a reasonable increase in the price of salt. Well-wishers followed along to watch, and the crowd numbered no less than three thousand people. Fortunately, Director Li Jiajian personally came out to appease them, promising to forward the petition to the higher authorities and find a way to provide relief. The salt workers then returned to their villages in formation without causing any trouble.</p>

<h3>Zheng Tongpo, A Dutch Overseas Chinese Merchant, Came to Shanghai to Investigate Rubber Factories</h3>
<p>Zheng Tongpo, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant from Silboya, Sumatra Island, Dutch East Indies, runs a large-scale rubber raw material business. His company, Qiaoxing Rubber Factory, has many European and Japanese companies that do business with him. Zheng heard that the raw materials of domestic rubber factories are mostly handled by the Japanese, which is not a way to recover our country's rights and interests. Therefore, he returned to China from Southeast Asia a month ago. He first went to various factories in Japan for investigation and then came to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and stayed at the East Asia Hotel. Guo Yongkang of the Shanghai Chemical Industry Association and Liu Shimu of the China-South China Association accompanied Zheng, as this visit has a major mission and is different from ordinary tourism. They specially accompanied him to visit the Yisheng Rubber Factory on Binlang Road. Li Baosheng, the technician of the factory, and Tu Dianchen, the manager, gave him a warm reception, and they had a very pleasant conversation. Zheng described in detail the situation of rubber production in the British and Dutch territories of Southeast Asia, as well as the raw materials, quality, color, cost, value, and the inside story of European, American, and Japanese merchants manipulating the market. He also brought samples to test the quality on the spot, and the results were very satisfactory. Zheng also promised to provide various conveniences to domestic factories in future transactions and not to charge spot prices. It is reported that Zheng still needs to visit the Great China Rubber Factory and Zhenhua Paint and other factories today to prepare to report to the overseas Chinese merchants of various raw materials in Southeast Asia in the future.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Approves Postal Bureau Loan</h3>
<p>First Phase Loan of One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Loaned by the Savings and Remittance Bureau, to be Repaid in Ten Years</p>
<p>The General Directorate of Posts of the Ministry of Communications has negotiated a loan of one million yuan from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to build branch post office buildings in various places. The contract has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and was officially signed at the end of last month. The annual interest rate is 7.5% and will be repaid in ten years. As soon as the Ministry of Communications approves the construction plan, bidding can begin and construction can begin. The details learned by the New News Agency reporter are listed below:</p>
<p>Loan Process</p>
<p>The General Directorate of Posts has more than 5,000 post office branches across the country, of which only about 50 have self-built premises. The rest are rented from local city houses or similar buildings for office use. This not only detracts from the appearance, but also the annual rent is a significant expense. In order to save expenses, the General Directorate of Posts negotiated with the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to invest in building postal branches in various places. After more than two months of consultation between the two parties, it was decided to proceed in stages. At the same time, it was also agreed that the amount of the first phase loan would be one million yuan. Then, the Savings and Remittance Bureau drafted a draft contract, which was reviewed by the General Directorate of Posts, and presented to the Ministry of Communications for approval. It was officially signed in Shanghai at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Signing of the Contract</p>
<p>The contract was formally signed in Shanghai at the end of last month. The representatives who signed the contract were Guo Xin Song, Director-General of Posts, and Tang Baoshu, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The main points of the contract are recorded below: 1. The total loan amount is one million yuan, which can be borrowed through overdraft. 2. The post office property and land built with the loan will be used as collateral. 3. The annual interest rate is 7.5%. 4. The post office will allocate 15% of the cost of the building each month to repay the principal and interest. 5. The loan term is ten years, and the principal and interest will be repaid. 6. After the principal and interest are repaid, all the newly built buildings in various places will belong to the post office. 7. Payment method: If a certain place starts construction and needs funds, it can be allocated to the Savings and Remittance Bureau at any time.</p>
<p>Presented to the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>After the contract was signed, the General Directorate of Posts and the Savings and Remittance Bureau will present the original contract, the payment and repayment methods, and the construction plan of the postal branch office to the Ministry of Communications for review and approval. As soon as the Ministry of Communications' approval is received in Shanghai, the General Directorate of Posts will solicit designs and invite tenders for construction. In the future, after the first phase of the building construction plan is completed, the second phase of construction will be carried out.</p>
<p>Construction Plan</p>
<p>The General Directorate of Posts believes that there are more than 40 places where branch office buildings need to be built. It is impossible to build them all at the same time with such a large amount of money. Therefore, they are proceeding gradually according to the urgency. The first phase is planned to start construction in the following locations: 1. Chengdu Postal Administration Bureau, 2. Changsha Postal Administration Bureau, 3. Wuchang First Class Post Office, 4. Nanchang Postal Administration Bureau, 5. Henan Hekou Post Office, 6. Shanghai Central District Post Office. Other places such as Yichang, Jiujiang, and Shashi are planned to be built in the second phase.</p>

<p>Lei Baohua, Director of the Shaanxi Construction Department, went to Nanjing a few days ago with engineer Wu Weizhou to negotiate with the National Construction Commission for the purchase of generators from the Capital Electric Plant in order to establish the Xi'an Electric Plant. This matter has been successfully completed, and he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 7:25 AM yesterday. According to him, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, his trip to Nanjing was solely to inspect the generators of the Capital Electric Plant. The generators are very good, totaling 750 kilowatts, and the electricity they generate will be sufficient for Xi'an's Jin Cheng area. After successful negotiations, it is expected that they will be transported and installed soon. The capital for the Xi'an Electric Plant is tentatively set at 500,000 yuan, jointly operated by the government and businesses, with government shares accounting for 250,000 yuan and business shares accounting for 250,000 yuan. Regarding the Wei River Diversion Loan of 1.5 million yuan, which Shaanxi Province is borrowing from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Bank and other five banks in this city, the loan agreement has been drafted and will be formally signed after Mr. Lei reviews it.</p>

<h3>The International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestically Produced Products</h3>
<p>Chemical Raw Materials: According to the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, soda ash and crystal alum are important chemical raw materials used extensively in the manufacture of glass, soap, paper, and dyeing, among other things. Borax is an indispensable raw material for making glass enamel powder and in the ceramics industry and medicine. Sulfur also has significant uses in chemistry, dyeing, and medicine. Copper sulfate is a raw material for making dyes and colors, has a fixing effect in printing and dyeing, can be used as a tonic, emetic, and astringent in medicine, and as an insecticide in horticulture. Talcum powder is the most widely used raw material for manufacturing cosmetics. Hide glue can be used for making glue. As for the uses of three acids, they are even more extensive and cannot be fully described. Chen Li Chen Company of Java Batavi, specializing in import and export business, has sent a letter requesting the above-mentioned industrial products. Please have the manufacturers send letters to the Guidance Department of the Bureau for introduction.</p>
<p>Tung Oil and Silk Cocoons: The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has now been fully set up after moving to the sixth floor of the Bank of China warehouse at 1040 North Suzhou Road. The Bureau announced yesterday that the Czech Biedermann Industrial Company and the German Doest Jun have sent letters requesting tung oil from our country. Tung oil merchants who wish to undertake this transaction can contact the Bureau for introduction. Because tung oil produced in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in our country occupies an important position in international trade, and now Japanese merchants have ambitions to seize the market, purchasing tung oil seeds and going to plant them, the Ministry of Industry has issued an order to all provincial and municipal governments prohibiting the export of tung oil seeds to prevent the market from being seized. Also, the Czech Adam Foreign Company has sent a letter stating that it is managing the promotion of silk cocoons and woolen products from our country. Manufacturers who wish to promote sales to that country can also be introduced by the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Sales of Domestic Products Increase in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>However, Competition from Japanese Goods is Also Very Fierce</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that a reporter learned from domestic product circles yesterday about the current situation of domestic products being shipped and sold to Southeast Asia. In recent years, the promotion of domestic products has been very active in various places, so the production of domestic products has increased accordingly. At the same time, the export of domestic products has also increased slightly, which is indeed a good phenomenon. Southeast Asia is a place where many overseas Chinese reside, and their enthusiasm for using domestic products is sufficient to increase the sales of domestic products, so the sales of domestic products in Southeast Asia are better than in other overseas regions. However, Japanese goods have long occupied a dominant position in the Southeast Asian market. Shipping domestic products for promotion is difficult to compete with due to insufficient capital and other reasons. For example, in a small city near Singapore, Japanese rubber overshoes are sold for only twenty cents each, while the import tax on our country's products shipped there is thirty-one cents. There are many similar situations. However, since Southeast Asia is a large market for the sale of domestic products, we should find ways to compete and not let this good large market be permanently affected by the competition from Japanese goods.</p>

<h3>Director Wen's Funeral Will Be Held This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Coffin Will Be Temporarily Placed in the Zheng Ning Guild Hall to Await a Suitable Date for Transportation to Guangdong</p>

<h3>The National Cotton Yarn Association Held an Extraordinary General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Cotton Consolidated Tax Issue</p>
<p>The National Chinese Cotton Mill Association held an extraordinary meeting of all manufacturers at its headquarters on Edward Road at 2 PM yesterday. Representatives from ninety-two factories in Shanghai (Wing On, Shen Xin, Heng Bian, Wei Tong, Tong Yi, Pu Yi, Min Sheng), Wuxi (Yu Kang, Qing Feng, Li Xin, Zhen Xin, Guang Qin), Qingdao (Hua Xin), Tianjin (Yu Yuan, Da Xing), etc., including Guo Shun, Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, Wang Qiyu, Dong Zhongsheng, Shen Boqin, Liu Baisen, Xu Laicheng, Liu Qingji, Qian Guanyi, Deng Chuheng, Luo Huizong, Qian Jiansan, Yan Huichen, Xu Maotang, Yao Likang, Cheng Jingtang, Sun Beixuan, Xu Wenlie, Li Qihua, Lu Chongzhi, Huang Shoumin, Chen Ertong, and thirty-two others, attended. Guo Shun presided over the meeting, and Zhang Zemin recorded it. In addition to a report by the representatives who went to Nanjing last time to submit a petition, there was also a discussion on the issue of the Ministry of Finance increasing the consolidated cotton tax by 20%. According to those familiar with the industry, the Yarn Association unanimously advocated at yesterday's meeting that the Ministry of Finance should levy the consolidated cotton tax in stages until after 5 PM.</p>
<h3>The YWCA's Statement on the New Criminal Law</h3>
<p>The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) on Yuanmingyuan Road believes that Article 239 and Article 221 of the recently passed Criminal Law Amendment by the Legislative Yuan violate the principles of equality between men and women and the protection of humanity. It convened a joint meeting of the Municipal and Xie Associations yesterday morning to discuss how to respond to the movement of women's groups in the capital and throughout the country to strive for equality and protection under the law. It has now been resolved to elect representatives Ms. Ling Chen Yingmei. Ms. Li Xie Weipeng. Ms. Hu Zhongying. etc. to participate in petition groups from women's groups from various places and petition the Central Political Committee, and has prepared a petition as follows, Petitioning that Article 239 and Article 221, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, amended by the Legislative Yuan, violate the principles of equality between men and women and the protection of young girls, and request that the Legislative Yuan be ordered to re-enact the articles of law based on the principles of equality between men and women and the protection of young girls, in order to protect women's rights and defend humanity. The Legislative Yuan's amendment to the Criminal Law was based on the unanimous request of women across the country for a thorough change to the various unequal and inhumane provisions between men and women in the past to align with the spirit of the times. However, the gentlemen of the Legislative Yuan are deeply entrenched, only caring about facts and not asking about truth. Although Article 256 of the current Criminal Law has been formally amended to a sentence of less than one year, in fact, the husband still has the right to sue, and the wife has no right to sue, preserving the dual morality in the relationship between the sexes, placing wives at a disadvantage. Article 240, Section 2 of the current Criminal Law is in line with the provisions that the age of marriage is under sixteen years old. However, the Legislative Yuan amended Article 221, Section 2 of the Criminal Law this time, changing sixteen years old to fourteen years old, which not only contradicts the current civil law, but also causes young girls to lose the protection they should have. Although it is said that in large cities, a small number of young girls are already grown up at the age of fourteen, in general, girls of this age in various parts of the country are not fully developed in terms of physiology and psychology. Legislators should make every effort to protect them. Now, changing sixteen years old to fourteen years old goes against the original purpose of human protection. This association feels deeply that the resolution of these two articles needs to be reconsidered by the Legislative Yuan. In addition to electing representatives to come forward and petition, this association respectfully requests that the Central Political Conference order the Legislative Yuan to re-enact the articles of law based on the principles of equality between men and women and the protection of young girls, in order to protect women's rights and defend humanity. It is impossible to wait for orders with urgency. Respectfully presented to the Central Political Conference, the National Association of the Chinese Christian Young Women's Association, the Shanghai Municipal Association, respectfully presented.</p>
<h3>The Third Batch of Representatives Demanding Legal Equality Between Men and Women Went to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhonghua Women's Association Bu Zhenhua, etc.</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that various women's groups in this city are opposed to the Legislative Yuan's amendment to the Criminal Law, which stipulates that raping a woman under the age of fourteen is considered rape, and that a married woman who commits adultery is sentenced to imprisonment of less than one year, etc., favoring men and failing to balance the legal rights of men and women. The Women's Progressive Association and the Women's League have successively sent representatives to Nanjing to petition. The Zhonghua Women's Association specially sent representatives Bu Zhenhua and others at 8 AM yesterday, with documents, to Nanjing by the Beijing-Shanghai Express to petition. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter met Ms. Bu on the train yesterday. According to her, the association changed the age of sixteen for women to fourteen, and those who are raped will be charged with rape, which is related to women's lifelong health. Article 239 of the Criminal Law stipulates that a married woman who commits adultery will be sentenced to imprisonment, but a married man who commits adultery will not be charged, which is contrary to the principle of equality between men and women, so she specially went to Nanjing to petition the Legislative Yuan and the Central Political Committee to correct it. The established purpose can be divided into one to cancel the provisions of Article 239, otherwise the same criminal law should be added to men, and two to maintain the age of sixteen as the age of rape. After going to Nanjing, they will jointly request the representatives of the League and the Progressive Association to achieve equality between men and women in legal rights.</p>

Zheng Xiangzhou presided over the meeting, and Secretary-General Xue Futing acted as master of ceremonies. After the ceremony, the chairman delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Today, this association is holding a welcome for Directors Feng and Yang. It is a great honor to have Directors Feng and Yang attend. The two directors, Feng and Yang, are working extraordinarily hard for production and construction, especially for the revival of national sugar. They have a great determination. Last month, I was in Guangdong and saw the towering sugar factory, which was large in scale and well-equipped. At that time, Director Feng told me that the goods could be shipped in January of the national calendar, and a three-year plan was planned to increase production year by year, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and prevent the country from leaking huge leaks. This kind of perseverance and determination is enough to make us respectfully respect. The welcome we are holding today is to express our great admiration."</p>
<p>Public Banquet</p>
<p>After the chairman delivered the welcome speech, Directors Feng and Yang gave speeches, reporting on the progress of the provincial sugar factory and the mission to Shanghai, and expressing their gratitude for the welcome. After the meeting, photos were taken. At 6 PM, the Sugar Industry Association held a public banquet for Directors Feng and Yang, and the evening ended late. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter met Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Guangxi Industry and Commerce Bureau, yesterday. According to him, the task of coming to Shanghai this time was to investigate the sales situation of sugar in Shanghai and the recent situation of the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Now the official business has been completed, and he will return to the province from Shanghai the day after tomorrow (that is, today and tomorrow).</p>
<h3>The Shipping Association Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Pilotage Fees</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Was Absent Due to Illness</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association on Wuma Road convened a general meeting of all members at 3 PM yesterday regarding the revised pilotage fee issue forwarded by the Customs. Seventeen shipping companies, including Zhongxing, Ning Shao, etc., attended. As the chairman of the association, Yu Qiaqing, was absent due to illness, the entire meeting had no opinions. Whether to accept the revised prices by the Customs was very complicated and could not be consistent. As a result, it was resolved to convene another meeting after Chairman Yu recovers from his illness.</p>
<h3>The Lawyers Association Telegraphed Congratulations to the Minister of Justice</h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China telegraphed two congratulatory messages to the three ministers of the Judicial Administration Department in Nanjing, Ju, Xie and Pan yesterday. One message to Ju, Minister of the Judicial Administration Department in Nanjing, with congratulations and hopes that he will successfully fulfill his mission and establish the prestige of the judiciary. The second message to the two vice-ministers of the Judicial Administration Department in Nanjing, Xie and Pan, with congratulations and hopes that they will successfully fulfill their new appointments.</p>
<h3>Various Public Organizations Schedule a Banquet for Song Faxiang to Discuss Promoting Domestic Goods to the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Song Faxiang, Consul General stationed in Batavia, taking advantage of the opportunity to attend the Fifth National Congress, was entrusted by the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies to contact domestic manufacturers for the promotion of domestic goods in Southeast Asia. The National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Industrial Federation, and the Shanghai Chinese Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association and other five groups in this city have specially scheduled a public banquet for Mr. Song at Yiyou Society at 115 Hankou Road at 5 PM on the seventeenth of this month to discuss the methods of promoting domestic goods to the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industry Associations That There is No Age Limit for Representatives</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various industry associations yesterday stating: "Dear Sirs, on the ninth of this month, we received Instruction No. 1326 from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, which stated: 'The Public Letter No. 8288 from the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Executive Committee, approved by your association on February 17 of this year (No. 5852), requests an interpretation regarding the meaning of the age limit for members and representatives of industrial and commercial associations. The meeting of the court on the uniform interpretation of laws and regulations has decided that Article 11 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations only applies the provisions of the Law on Chambers of Commerce to staff and meetings, while Article 4 of the same law has no age limit for representatives of companies and firms, then the age of the association's representatives and staff is not restricted by Article 10 of the Law on Chambers of Commerce, and the corresponding letter is returned to your association for verification, etc.' Therefore, regarding the interpretation of laws and regulations, the corresponding order is notified to the association to inform it, and to instruct its subordinates to know as necessary, etc.' Therefore, if the current articles of association of each association have age restrictions for member representatives and elected staff, they can revise the articles of association with appropriate procedures based on the previous explanation, which is very important."</p>
<h3>The Cotton Firm Association Telephones a Request to Expedite the Shipment of Cotton South</h3>
<p>The Cotton Firm Association, because of the congestion at Jinan Station, telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, saying: "Ministry of Railways Appreciation, according to the members' report, recently a large batch of cotton has been loaded at Jinan Station, and it has not arrived in Shanghai after more than ten days of loading the car. After inquiring with the station, there is no definite indication. Such delays are very important in terms of market price fluctuations, and even more important in terms of supplying the yarn factory period. Now the cotton production in North China is pouring south. If it is allowed to delay, it will inevitably accumulate more and more, and the more it accumulates, the more it will be delayed. Please kindly request to find a way to dredge it, so as to be timely and fast, etc.' Based on this, it is found that the Ministry of Railways handles intermodal transport in order to seek convenience for merchants and travelers. Jinan to Shanghai only takes three days. According to the above, it is against the original intention of the Ministry of Railways to handle intermodal transport. It is reasonable to report the situation by telegram to the Ministry of Railways. Immediately transport the loaded cotton to Shanghai, and also urge each transportation station to transport all cotton as soon as it is loaded, and do not delay it, without waiting for orders with urgency. respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers from Yancheng Decided to Erect a Monument to Martyr Pan at Baziqiao</h3>
<p>Martyr Pan Shengyi was from Yancheng. During the Shanghai War on January 28, he followed the Nineteenth Route Army and served as a second lieutenant company officer. He died resisting Japan in the Mengjiajiao Miaohangzhen area of Zhabei, and his merit was great. After verification by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, his mother, Ni Tai, received the first pension a month ago. Wei Jiqi, Gu Zhuxuan, Jin Jiulin, Tian Shuquan, Wang Xiufu, Zheng Jiansan, Wu Gongtui, and other fellow villagers from Yancheng in Shanghai held a memorial service for Martyr Pan Shengyi at the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association on Zhongshan Road in Zhabei on the thirteenth of this month. Hundreds of people from all walks of life in Yancheng, including politics, academia, business, and industry, attended. The presidium, Li Jingfan, Cheng Bianchun, and Gu Songmao, were elected. It was felt that during the Great War on January 28, some fellow villagers from Yancheng were said to be traitors in northern Jiangsu. Now, Martyr Pan's sacrifice for the country is a great honor for his fellow villagers. The "Memorial Book of Martyrs Resisting Japan" compiled and printed by Yin Shuixin describes in detail the deeds of Martyr Pan's filial piety and loyalty. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also has a special inscription. It was resolved to build a monument and erect a statue of the martyr at Baziqiao to show that he is not forgotten. At the end, Cheng Bianchun thanked the family members of Martyr Pan on behalf of the family members and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>The Fourteenth Batch of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Industrial Association reported that at 5 PM yesterday, Wu Yousheng, Huang Dejin, and two other overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, the fourteenth batch, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese postal ship "Shanghai Maru." After the ship docked at Huishan Wharf, the overseas Chinese landed and stayed at the Fuxing Inn in Hongkou. A reporter from the Industrial Association met Wu and Huang at the inn and heard a very detailed account of the expulsion, and they were very distressed. They said that although they had returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai, they had no money and would ask the municipal government for relief funds tomorrow (that is, today) to return to their hometowns and make a living.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Association's Zhenwu Report in Haining Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jisheng Association of China is currently handling emergency relief in the Haining 2353 district. According to reports, the fifth district has been surveyed, and there are already 17,800 disaster-stricken households, with approximately five to six to seven to eight people per household. There is little congee and many monks, and they are in urgent need of help. At this critical moment, the Shanghai Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association delivered 3,000 yuan of ocean coins to Haining for additional relief. The association has already sent a letter to Director Li Yunmen to investigate the poorest households in the three districts and provide an additional one yuan per household to assist them. However, there is too much demand and too little money, and it is difficult to allocate. It is hoped that benevolent compatriots at home and abroad will sympathize with such a tragic disaster and provide relief to save lives. Saving one life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. Respectfully appealing for the disaster victims to kowtow, and they await orders with urgency.</p>
<h3>China Animal Protection Association Organizes Release of Animals</h3>
<p>The China Animal Protection Association, in order to actively develop animal protection work, is planning to establish a release park to receive animals released by all sectors of society and to house stray dogs. It is reported that the association has already borrowed a piece of land, the former stray dog shelter west of Longhua Temple in Longhua Town, from the Shanghai Buddhist Association free of charge. The land covers more than twenty acres. Yesterday, the association's organizers, Pan Renwei, Yao Huian, Zheng Mingrong, Zhang Yongbin, and others, went to inspect the site and found it very suitable. However, the existing houses and walls are mostly dilapidated and need to be repaired and added to, which will require considerable expense. The organizers have already started planning.</p>
<h3>Road Association Seeks General Information from Outlying Branches</h3>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association is currently seeking members. More than ninety teams have been formed in this city. Many heads of institutions in other cities have formed teams to support the association. It is reported that among the teams already formed, those at the central level include: the Foreign Affairs Team led by Wang Jingwei, the Finance Team led by Kong Yongzhi, the Executive Yuan Team led by Chu Minyi, the Ministry of Railways Team led by Gu Mengyu, and the Ministry of Industry Team led by Chen Gongbo.

The heads of various provincial institutions affiliated with the Finance, Railways, Foreign Affairs, and Industry ministries serve as branch team leaders. Abroad, there are: the Kyoto Team led by Lu Chunfang and Fan Hansheng, the Yokohama Team led by Wang Hongnian, the Honolulu Team led by Mei Jingzhou, and the Busan Team led by Chen Zuoqi. With simultaneous efforts at home and abroad and support from all sides, the association's development is said to have great promise.</p>
<h3>Industrial Accident Statistics for the Public Concession in October</h3>
<p>According to reports received by the Public Works Department, there were 217 industrial and occupational accidents in October, resulting in 24 deaths. Among the injured, 28 were women. The causes of the accidents were generally clear in 191 cases, and 146 cases were investigated. Analyzed by occupation, 46 cases occurred in the machine industry, resulting in 1 death; 21 cases occurred in the construction industry, resulting in 4 deaths; 59 cases occurred in the textile industry, resulting in 17 deaths; 13 cases occurred in the food and beverage industry; 14 cases occurred in the printing and binding industry; and 10 cases occurred in the transportation industry. Analyzed by cause of accident, 78 cases were due to machinery, resulting in 2 deaths, of which 23 cases involved belts or pulleys, 15 cases involved pressure vessels, and 10 cases involved rollers. There were 5 cases due to explosions, resulting in 1 death; 25 cases due to fires, resulting in 17 deaths; 25 cases due to being struck by falling objects; 26 cases due to slips and falls, resulting in 4 deaths; 7 cases due to burns from hot objects; and 3 cases due to electric shock, with no deaths. This month, a fire broke out in a cotton batting shop at night, resulting in 16 deaths, of which 15 were residents of the shop and 1 was a resident of a neighboring house. From this incident, it can be seen that in places where cotton is processed, there should be no more mezzanine structures, and attention must be paid to the installation of electrical wiring.</p>
<h3>International Photography Exhibition Should Not Be Preempted by Others</h3>
<p>Hu Boxiang Discusses the Necessity of Chinese People Initiating One</p>
<p>A reporter from the Kwok Man News Agency interviewed Mr. Hu Boxiang, an advocate of artistic photography, regarding the Shanghai International Photography Exhibition and the situation of a certain person organizing it in Shanghai. The following is a record of Mr. Hu's response: Photography is one of the arts that is most easily popularized internationally. In Europe, America, and Japan, groups abound, engaged in the study of photography's art and skills in pursuit of refinement. Each year, in addition to domestic photography exhibitions, there are also international photography exhibitions, collecting photographic works from countries around the world for public exhibition. In recent years, there have been quite a few Chinese photographers who have submitted works to international photography exhibitions in various countries. The international photography exhibitions of various countries are always initiated and hosted by well-known groups in the host country. I had no prior knowledge of the so-called Shanghai International Photography Exhibition. It is said that the association held a meeting in a certain place a few days ago and exhibited for two days. According to reports, a staff member of a certain country's photographic materials store was in charge of everything at the venue. It is also said that the venue will be moved and more meetings will be held for several days. Certain people from a certain country consider themselves representatives of Eastern culture, and they spare no effort to undermine the position and honor of the Chinese nation in various European and American countries. Before the September 18th Incident, a certain country had a "Manchurian Photography Yearbook," all based on the country as a unit. Their use of "Manchuria" to mislead the world is obvious. I do not know whether the so-called Shanghai International Photography Exhibition has any purpose other than to attract customers for a certain country's company. Fortunately, very few Chinese people participated this time, and the world has not yet known its content and treats it as a game. The media has not supported it. Chinese people have also made great progress in photography in recent years, and it is necessary to initiate a formal international photography exhibition, solicit works from writers around the world for public exhibition, and learn from each other and connect with each other. I will work with Chinese people to plan this next year.</p>
<h3>Yousheng Tour Group to South China Departs Today</h3>
<p>The Yousheng Travel Group, located at the corner of Labourdonnais Road and Nanking Road in this city, is the only group that promotes travel. This autumn, it organized a North China tour, covering a distance of over ten thousand miles, visiting the ancient capital and exploring the outer reaches, breaking the Chinese people's habit of preferring to stay at home. Recently, it has been actively carrying out group affairs and is again organizing a South China tour. It has specially chartered the Haiyuan, a new ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, for its maiden voyage, scheduled to depart this afternoon. It is reported that the number of participating members is unusually large. Among travel groups in the country, chartering a giant ship for a return trip can be said to be an innovation.</p>
<h3>Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory Establishes Another Testing Institute</h3>
<p>The Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, in order to ensure that its various injectable drugs are truly effective, has not only hired experts to set up a research laboratory for research, but also established a testing institute to test their functions. The feeding of animals used in the testing institute is quite complicated, so a Chinese technician who studied in Japan was hired to manage it. A large number of animals are now raised on the factory's premises on Jiangwan Sports Association Road. The factory's casting office recently completed the review of the factory building drawings and telegraphed Mr. Chu Minyi for instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court Prepares to Hand Over</h3>
<p>Lou Ying, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, has been transferred to the Supreme Court as a judge by his superiors. Zhong Shangbin, the former judge of the Jiangsu High Court, has been transferred to the Shanghai District Court as the chief prosecutor.

<h3>Disturbances at the China Alcohol Factory</h3>
<p>Thugs Cause Trouble</p>
<p>The China Alcohol Manufacturing Factory in Baiyun Jingkou, Pudong, is a joint venture between the Ministry of Industry and wealthy overseas Chinese merchants. Since the construction of the factory buildings, there have been repeated attempts by people to contract for the factory's transportation work. The factory, emphasizing mechanical transportation and requiring very little manual labor, and because the contracting system is inconsistent with the central government's principles of labor transportation, decided to run its own transportation department. Unexpectedly, some people still tried to sabotage it. At about 11:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month, the police officer stationed at the factory by the Tangqiao Police Station and the factory's foreman simultaneously reported that dozens of thugs, traveling in six boats and carrying weapons, had arrived at the factory to cause trouble. One of them rushed to Chen Deyong, the foreman employed by the factory, looking for a quarrel. He saw him stab himself in the head with a dagger. Another rogue cut a fellow gang member on the back and then shouted and yelled. Dozens of thugs who had been lying in ambush swarmed forward and beat him up, then dragged Chen Deyong onto a waiting boat. Mao Yuliang, another worker at the factory, tried to stop them but was also beaten up and dragged onto the boat. The police officers were shocked and shouted to stop them, but the boat had already left the shore. They requested that the water patrol team be telegraphed for rescue. Liu Zongji and Li Han, officials of the factory, rushed to the Pootung wharf upon hearing the alarm, but only saw two boats and more than ten thugs who had been intercepted by the customs harbor police who were patrolling the river. Chen and Mao were fortunately unharmed. The thugs in the other four boats had escaped. The Tangqiao Police Station transferred the arrested thugs to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

They forced the company's manager, Zhang Fengshou, and the cashier, Qu Wofu, to hand over the keys to the silver box. After opening the silver box, they took all the cash and silver dollars inside, totaling 3,100 yuan, and fled the scene with their loot. Afterwards, the company's cashier, Qu Wofu, reported the situation to the 16th Precinct and requested that the robbers be pursued. He stated that 2,000 yuan of the stolen money belonged to a Pinghu customer who had temporarily deposited it with the company, while the remaining 1,100 yuan was the company's ticket revenue for the day.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Person Follows Someone for No Reason</h3>
<p>Sun Jinquan Desperately Reports to the Police</p>
<p>One Person Shot in the Right Leg</p>
<p>Sun Jinquan, a native of Zhenjiang, runs the Gongda Brick and Tile Company. On the evening of the 27th of last month, Sun was robbed on Jiujiang Road. At 7:45 p.m. on the 10th of this month, Sun came out of the Luo Chung Kok teahouse on Zhejiang Road and saw several suspicious people looking at him on the road. Sun suspected that they were thieves and went to the Youpeng Lime Office on the opposite side to take temporary shelter. He did not come out until 8:00 p.m. He saw that the people were still standing on the street. Sun walked south, but the people followed him. When he passed the intersection of Hubei Road and Jiujiang Road, Sun reported to the Chinese constable No. 2761 on duty, saying that the people following him were robbers. The constable went forward to stop them and ordered them to stop. Unexpectedly, one of them not only did not listen but reached into his bag and took out a steel door bar. The constable suspected that he was taking out a gun to resist and fired a shot from his pistol, hitting the person in the right leg. The injured person fell to the ground and was arrested. The others escaped. Later, Zhou Guisen, the Chinese detective of the Laoza Police Station, found out that the injured person's name was Liu Xueyou, a native of Jiangbei. He was sent to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he brought Sun Jinquan to the First Special Court Criminal Division One. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, explained the case, stating that it had not yet been determined whether Liu Xueyou was a thief, but Sun Jinquan had falsely accused him. He asked the court to decide whether it was necessary to detain him. The case was postponed until Liu recovered from his injuries before the trial. Sun Jinquan then repeated the above situation. Judge Feng Shide verified the votes and ordered that the case be postponed until Liu Xueyou recovered from his injuries before the trial. Sun Jinquan was released on bail of 1,000 yuan, pending summons.</p>
<h3>Abandoning His Lover After Seduction, Fu Liangzhen Appeals</h3>
<p>Kong Fanqin Also Refuses to Accept the Original Judgment and Appeals</p>
<p>Whose Flesh is in Her Belly?</p>
<p>[Final Argument Yesterday, Judgment on the 20th]</p>
<p>Fu Liangzhen, a Guangdong woman, 34 years old, currently resides at No. 137 Longmen Road. Her husband has passed away. In the spring of this year, Fu went to the Wing On Company to shop and met Kong Fanqin, the owner of the Detai Nisshin Bank at No. 43 Avenue Edward VII, who is from Ningbo. Seeing that Fu was wearing heavy mourning clothes, Kong knew that she was a widow and went forward to seduce her. Fu was weak-minded and was deceived by him. Initially, they exchanged sweet words by telephone. On the ninth day of the third month of the lunar calendar this year, Kong invited Fu to Nanjing and stayed at the Xicheng Hotel. Kong asked to have relations with Fu. Fu refused. Kong promised to marry her. He then achieved his goal. From then on, they had secret meetings in Kyoto and Shanghai, using hotels as their meeting places. They stayed at the Xicheng Hotel in Nanjing three times and at Room 517 of the Great China Hotel in Shanghai several times. Unexpectedly, after several trysts, Fu became pregnant. Fu asked Kong to fulfill his previous promise and hold a wedding. Unexpectedly, Kong broke his promise and stopped communicating with Fu, abandoning her as if she were garbage. Fu then sued Kong for seduction and abandonment in the First Special District Court. Kong also hired lawyer Zhan Jiwo to file a counterclaim for false accusation. As a result of the trial, both Fu and Kong were found not guilty. Both parties expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the Second Branch of the High Court, presided over by Judge Zhao Zhengzhang, along with Assessors Zhou Han and Jiang Shuzi, opened Criminal Division One for interrogation. According to Fu's statement, Kong Fanqin seduced me into having sexual relations, and after I became pregnant, he abandoned me. Now he even denies that the flesh in my belly is his. How will I deal with this child after it is born? She cried incessantly while speaking. When questioned, Kong confessed that Fu was a prostitute and that he had only drunk wine and tipped her, but there was no physical relationship. He also presented the madam Zhao Laoda as proof, saying that the accusation was false and requesting that she be punished for false accusation. The court stated that Fu's statement of having sexual relations was very clear and that it was a fact. However, Kong still denied it. The court, finding the facts clear, ordered the conclusion of the argument. After the lawyers for Fu and Zhan debated with each other, the court ordered that the judgment be announced at 2:00 p.m. on the 20th.</p>

<h3>Naval Vessels Fighting Pirates Fiercely off Taoshen Port</h3>
<p>Three pirate ships, one sunk, one captured, one escaped</p>
<p>More than twenty pirates killed, seven captured alive</p>
<p>The Fishery Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry believes that pirates have become rampant again on the ocean surface. Without seriously suppressing bandits, it would be impossible to calm the maritime atmosphere. Therefore, at the beginning of the fishing season, it dispatched its patrol ships to step up patrols on the seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to secure the fishing industry. The No. 1 patrol ship of the Office received a confidential report in Dinghai, stating that a large number of pirates were gathered on the sea off Taoshen Port, plotting to rob passing ships. Upon receiving the information, the ship sailed to suppress them. Near Taoshen Port, it saw three civilian ships with suspicious signs. The ship immediately ordered them to stop and await inspection with signals. Unexpectedly, the three civilian ships ignored the signals and suddenly dispersed in a formation, surrounding the ship in the center. At a signal, gunfire erupted. Captain Liang of the ship was prepared and immediately ordered all officers and soldiers to fight bravely. For a time, guns and cannons fired together, and bullets rained down. The pirates also stubbornly resisted arrest, and a fierce battle lasted for two hours. One pirate ship sank in the middle of the gunfight, and the pirates' momentum suddenly became unsustainable. They fought and retreated, and the ship relentlessly pursued them. As a result, one pirate ship was captured, more than 20 people were killed, and seven people were captured alive. One sailor was slightly injured. It is reported that the seven captured pirates will be escorted to Shanghai by Captain Liang to be reported to the Fishery Protection Office for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Ms. Li Bingyan Issues an Important Statement</h3>
<p>Seeking Effective Assistance from All Sectors of Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhongshan Fellow Villagers Association Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Measures</p>
<p>Ms. Li Bingyan, a doctor of Chinese medicine, is from Nanlang, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. Several years ago, she graduated from Beijing Middle School and then came to Shanghai to enter the Chinese Medical College for further studies. After graduating this year, she practiced medicine in Shanghai. Later, she returned to the south due to a matter. On the 4th of this month, she returned to Shanghai from Guangdong on the China Merchants Bureau's *Wuyang* steamship, staying in the first-class cabin. On the way, she was almost raped by the shipowner, Nagui Tuo (a Norwegian). The situation has been briefly reported in the press. In order to understand the details, the reporter drove to the lady's private residence at No. 40 Yokohama Road to inquire. The lady received him personally and issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Ms. Li's Statement:</p>
<p>After graduating from the Chinese Medical College, I practiced medicine in Shanghai for several months. A few months ago, at the invitation of the Guangzhou Convenient Hospital, I first returned to Guangdong and worked at the hospital. Now, due to an important matter, I came to Shanghai again. On the 4th of this month, I took the China Merchants Bureau's *Wuyang* steamship north from Hong Kong. On the 6th, the ship arrived at Shantou and anchored at sea. At about 1:00 PM that night, I was suddenly broken into by the Norwegian shipowner (Captain K.W. Ngquist) (first-class cabin). At first, he tried to seduce me with flattery, then attempted to rape me. At that time, Bingyan was fast asleep. After waking up in fright, she was terrified. For self-defense, she resisted with all her might. Fortunately, she escaped and was not raped. The shipowner, unable to get his way, fled in a panic. For safety's sake, I asked the ship's second officer, Mr. Zhang Huoyan, to change my room. After two hours, the shipowner dared to come again and was rebuked by Second Officer Zhang and left. On the following night (the night of the 7th), late at night, the shipowner dared to knock on the door again, attempting a third act of bestiality. At that time, all the crew and passengers were outraged and almost caused an incident. The above is a simple account of the harassment. Although Bingyan was fortunate enough not to be raped this time, her personality and morals were not damaged. However, she suffered insults and was unwilling to accept them. The infringement on Bingyan's individual is small, but the impact on the future of the women's community is great. Moreover, the shipowner, as the role model for all the crew members, should respect his personality and ensure the safety of passengers and navigation. He dared to do such a dirty thing on a ship sailing under the flag of the Republic of China, which is unforgivable. If he is not severely punished, how can we deter others and uphold national law? Bingyan believes that this incident is of great importance to the reputation and morals of the women's community. Regarding the private prosecution, she can give it up from a moral standpoint. However, she is unwilling to stop the public prosecution. Bingyan is a weak woman, and her words carry little weight. She hopes that all sectors of Shanghai, based on human mutual assistance and maintaining social morality, will provide effective assistance. Then, not only can Bingyan's personal shame be redressed and national law can be upheld, but also social morality can be saved from disaster.</p>
<p>Fellow Villagers Association Assistance:</p>
<p>Ms. Li, aroused by this case, has separately requested assistance from various organizations in writing. It is reported that the local Zhongshan Fellow Villagers Association believes that the lady is from Zhongshan County, and because of their fellow villager relationship, it is difficult to ignore it. It plans to convene a general meeting of fellow villagers at the Yueqiao Commercial Federation on Bazhi Road tomorrow (the 15th) at 8:00 PM to discuss measures to provide assistance. Ms. Li will be invited to attend in person to report on the incident. The Association also notified all Zhongshan fellow villagers in Shanghai to participate enthusiastically and jointly plan the process.</p>
<h3>The Autopsy of Two People Who Died Tragically from Poisoning</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, in Room 43 of the Suzhou Hotel at No. 30, Lane 63, Zhejiang Road, a hotel resident named Zhu Ruixin, 26 years old, suddenly had the idea of ending her life for unknown reasons. She secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. She was discovered by the hotel tea servant Pan Yingen, who immediately reported to the Laozha Police Station and summoned an ambulance to rush her to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died. After investigation, only a key, six dimes, five copper coins, and two opium boxes were found by the deceased. There were no suicide notes or other items. Also, in Room 32 of the Datong Hotel at No. 4, Lane 21, Hubei Road, on the afternoon of the 10th of this month, the tea servant Ding Yinru found the hotel guest Ma Chuliang (24 years old, from Pinghu, a businessman) moaning in bed with a pale face. He reported to the Laozha Police Station, and the detective was instructed to investigate. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The doctor found that he had also taken opium. The above two cases were taken by the police to the Forensic Institute on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuji, arrived at the institute to examine the bodies. They confirmed that both had died from poisoning. Since no relatives were found, they instructed that the bodies be taken to the Pushan Villa for burial. It is presumed that these two people had no choice but to resort to this measure due to economic hardship.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrest of Accomplices in the Manufacture of Red Pills</h3>
<p>Huang Yufu, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, and detective Tang Pengfei, cracked a case of manufacturing the drug "red pills" in Room 57, Lane 713, Kunming Road, on the 4th of this month. They arrested the criminals Li Linsheng, Yang Lunyuan, Fei Zhangshi, and five others. It was discovered that the main culprit was the concubine Zhang Wangshi, who lived at No. 82 Fengyu Lane, Sazhang Road, French Concession. They went to arrest her, but she tried to escape, fell out of the window, and was injured. She was sent to the hospital for treatment. Li Linsheng and other criminals, along with a large number of red pills and raw materials, were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. During the postponement, the detectives continued to arrest the shareholders of the organization, Cheng Xinyou from Qingkou and Xu Songting from Xuzhou, at No. 9 East Xihua Road and No. 58 Yangzhou Road. They also found 320 red pills and smoking paraphernalia at the No. 965 Qiwupu Road branch and sent them to the Third Criminal Court. They were instructed to postpone the interrogation with Li Linsheng and others. The other day, the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case continued to arrest two accomplices, Sun Bian from Taizhou and the woman Sun Lishi, at No. 92 Wuhu Road and No. 1383 Aiduya Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen arrived at the court to interrogate them. Lawyer Li Zhiyou from the Public Works Department stated the details, saying that the two defendants were named by the arrested criminal Yang Lunyuan, and that they used to deliver the toxic pills made by the main organization to Zhang Wangshi's house and transfer them to certain places for distribution. He requested a postponement for further interrogation. The two defendants' statements were vague. Judge Xiao instructed them to be detained separately and tried together with Li and others after further investigation.</p>

<h3>Early Implementation of Winter Defense This Year The Garrison Headquarters Investigates the City's Police Force</h3>
<p>Joint Meeting to be Held at the End of this Month</p>
<p>The Date of Implementation of Winter Defense Will Be Determined</p>
<p>The joint implementation of winter defense by military and police agencies is usually held in mid-January of the Gregorian calendar (i.e., December of the lunar calendar, when all industries summarize their accounts). However, this year, the economic situation is worse than in previous years. At the same time, agricultural production has been poor, and the livelihoods of the poor are difficult. There have been cases of social unrest in the interior. Since Shanghai is a mixed area of Chinese and foreigners with a mix of good and bad, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has decided to implement joint winter defense early to prevent problems before they occur. It has submitted the proposed winter defense measures to the Municipal Government for review and ordered the military, police, and bureaus to comply and implement them. Furthermore, it convened military and police agencies such as the Municipal Security Bureau, the Security Department, the Security Corps, and the Water Police Team at the Longhua Headquarters the other day to discuss in detail the city's military and police strength. Forms were printed and distributed for completion, reporting the military and police areas, so that the situation can be considered and implemented separately. It is also scheduled to convene a joint meeting at the end of this month to discuss and decide on the date of implementation of winter defense.</p>

<h3>Publication of the New Drug Guide</h3>
<p>Physician Deng Yuanhe, in light of the numerous and varied "special effect" drugs on the market, noisily advertised in newspapers and spread by word of mouth, recognized that while this offered many conveniences to the medical community, it also allowed speculators to exploit the good name of new drugs to deceive the public, using newspaper advertisements to fill their own pockets. Not only does society lose its ability to discern the truth, but even the medical community is sometimes dazzled by the skillful advertising and misled, to the detriment of patients. The saying that "medicine can cure diseases but also kill people" is indeed true. To prevent society from blindly following trends and to provide the medical community with a means of making informed choices, this physician has specially published the New Drug Guide, taking responsibility for guiding readers about new drugs. The publication is located at No. 92, Dawang Street, Nanshi, Shanghai. Subscriptions are now being solicited at half price for all those who subscribe from October 10th to the end of November.</p>

<h3>Special Feature: Several Fundamental Issues of the Chinese Constitution (Continued) - Lecture by Mr. Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Fan Shiqin.</p>
<p>(IV) The Rights and Obligations of the People: One of the fundamental issues to be resolved in the draft constitution is the rights and obligations of the people. The constitution is the fundamental law, and the rights and obligations of the people should naturally have appropriate provisions. However, these provisions cannot be too detailed and can only be stipulated in principle.</p>
<p>In the draft constitution, the rights and obligations of the people are stipulated in an indirect way. Of course, the best constitution is one that stipulates the rights of the people in detail, one by one. However, that is an ideal that can be accepted in principle, but there is considerable research on the facts. Why? Because this kind of provision is not easy. There are many kinds of people's freedom rights. If we stipulate them forever at the present time, and cannot go beyond this scope, that is not easy. The second difficulty is that if the people's freedom rights are stipulated in too much detail and too rigidly, it will cause difficulties for the country when the constitution is promulgated and implemented in the future. How do we say this? Because our constitution has a considerable relationship with every citizen, giving the people a considerable guarantee. At the same time, our country is a country created by the entire nation. The so-called "individua," especially now, the status of the nation is very important. If the people's freedom rights are fully developed, to a considerable extent, it may hinder the country's freedom and endanger the country's freedom. Because it is not successful to sacrifice the country and the nation by focusing on the individual. The current position is to find a way out for the national nation, not to find a way out for individuals. In fact, this cannot be done, and it cannot be universal. If the individual's freedom rights conflict with the country, it is better to sacrifice the individual's freedom rights to preserve the country. According to this provision, the draft constitution only gives indirect guarantees to the people's freedom rights.</p>
<p>Now, under this method, people have freedom of residence, assembly, communication, etc., but there are articles stipulating that they cannot be restricted except by law. The state can restrict the people's freedom rights according to law. When the first draft of our constitution was published, there was a lot of opposition to this point from the outside world. They argued that the people's freedom should be fully developed only with direct guarantees. In fact, this kind of opposition to indirect guarantees is lacking in whatever examples are given and cannot be shaken. For example, soldiers interfere with the people's freedom rights. This kind of behavior is everywhere in China. They do not act according to the law, but simply destroy the people's freedom rights. This is because China does not have a constitution, that is, it has not become a country under the rule of law. A soldier can issue orders to arrest people at will, and the people will have this kind of suffering, because there is no constitutional guarantee.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, there has been a standard for laws, that is, all laws must be resolved by the Legislative Yuan. Although this principle has not been fully achieved at present, in the past there were many soldiers whose orders had more power than the law, and even soldiers could legislate at will without passing through the legislative body. This kind of order to replace or change the law caused suffering to the people, not because it was received by the law. The establishment of law must be passed by the legislative body. The legislative body is the organ representing the people. Once a law is resolved, it cannot violate the requirements of the people. In this situation, the people can be said to have been guaranteed. Now, although our constitution has provisions restricting the people's freedom rights, it must be based on the law. This is the principle on which we are based.</p>
<p>(V) The Division of Political Power and Governing Power: The current constitution is based on the Five-Power Constitution as the standard and basis for stipulating the organization of the country. The Five-Power Constitution divides the political power and governing power into two parts, which has never been heard of by those who study political science. In general theory, political power and governing power are always indistinguishable. Our division is actually a new method. The power of the government is the power of governance, and the power of the people is the power of politics. The government is generated by the people. The way ordinary countries are generated is through a voting method, which is the so-called election. For example, the President of the United States is elected by popular vote, and the government is produced by the people's election. However, we want to supplement it. For example, the previous President of the United States was Hoover, but the people were dissatisfied with him a few years ago and criticized him severely. However, there is still no way to deal with Hoover, because he must wait for his term to expire before he can be re-elected. The re-election of the President of the United States is once every four years. Hoover was also a candidate this time, but the people voted more for Roosevelt, and Hoover was defeated. The people do not trust the president, but they must also wait until his term expires, and they cannot force him to step down during his term. Therefore, when necessary, or when there is a requirement, and they feel that the president is not good, they can use a method of impeachment. In addition to the right to elect, there is also the right to impeach, which is a supplement. It is not enough for the people to have only the right to elect, they must also have the right to impeach. Moreover, in addition to this, there should also be the right of initiative. For example, the Legislative Yuan is an organ representing the people, that is, a kind of parliament, entrusted by the people to pass laws and regulations. The various policies of the government should be approved by the Legislative Yuan. However, the people should also have the right to make laws. If the people have a requirement, a policy, if the parliament does not resolve it for him, the people in the United States have no way to deal with this situation. For example, during the prohibition period in the United States a few years ago, the people already felt that it was not working, but the people had no way to change it and cancel the prohibition law. Although it took many years of movement to achieve the goal, the people still cannot act directly, and they must wait for the approval of Congress. It took almost a few years for the law to change. Therefore, it is felt here that there must be the right of initiative. If the right of initiative can be implemented, the people can directly propose it without necessarily needing the consent of the Legislative Yuan. Conversely, if everyone's opinions change again in the future, they can also use a kind of referendum to overthrow the previous case again. The above four types are political power. Political power is not exercised by the government for the people, but is used by the people themselves. If the people want to use political power, the government cannot resist or interfere.</p>
<p>In addition to political power, there is governing power. The government exercises five powers on behalf of the people, that is, administration, legislation, justice, examination, and supervision. The National Government uses five kinds of governing powers to exercise. That is to exercise on behalf of the people. It is only entrusted by the people. The government and the people are very clear. What the government exercises is the five powers, and what the people exercise is the four powers. China has 400 million people. In fact, it is impossible to gather in one place and discuss national affairs every day. Therefore, the people have to elect a government to do things on behalf of the people. At the same time, the people can also impeach officials. As for the law, the Legislative Yuan is replacing the people to resolve it. However, the people still have the right to initiate and referend, the sum of the five courts of the government is only to exercise the power of governance in the five power constitution (to be continued)</p>

<p>Jia Duocai smiled and cupped his hands, saying, "Then, congratulations to Mr. Guo for certainly returning with a full load." Guo Dunpin laughed, "The two words 'full load' are out of the question. However, after muddling along for two years, I've managed to make up for the deficits of the past few years. I originally wanted to return to Jiangsu, but many friends in Xi'an kept pulling me back, always saying there were opportunities. Therefore, I lingered. If there really are opportunities, I won't return to Jiangsu. Just now, I was talking to Brother Shilian about the post-disaster relief donation, which is also something I want to manage. However, I don't have any cash on hand, so I've already written home to figure out how to raise the funds. If the money arrives, I'll have to do some serious networking. Now that Brother Shilian is here, I'm also advising him to take this path." Li Shilian shook his head with a smile, saying, "You're only seeing one side of the story. You've been in the Northwest for so many years, and you still can't network. How can I do it?" Guo Dunpin said seriously, "Of course, I don't need to lie or be polite. Based on my achievements in the Northwest over the past two years, I can naturally find some connections. However, just talking empty words won't do. These days, without this thing, people can't be active." As he spoke, he made a circle with his index finger and thumb, letting everyone see. Li Shilian laughed, "Then I'm even more out of the question." While they were talking, Jia Duocai was only watching from the side with a cold eye, letting them talk for a long time before interjecting, "Are there such difficulties? How much money is enough to network?" Guo Dunpin said, "That can't be certain, of course, but without money, nothing can be done. The more activity expenses, the better, of course." Jia Duocai pondered for a long time, then smiled slightly, "If I want to change careers and handle this matter, could you two lend me a hand?" Guo Dunpin closed his eyes slightly, swaying his body and head seven or eight times, then laughed, "Success doesn't have to be my own. If Mr. Jia has this intention, we can absolutely help." (63)</p>
<h3>Keting</h3>
<p>— By Ma Fosheng</p>
<p>Speaking of Keting, there are probably a few people who know it. I still vaguely remember when I was eleven years old, studying at the Keting Elementary School. At that time, there was a Mr. Shen, he was the art teacher at the elementary school, and he had a very good relationship with me. One day, he climbed up Keting to paint a landscape painting, and I followed him up (because the pavilion had been in disrepair for a long time, it was very dangerous to go up, and at that time, fearing that the students would fall, the ladder was already gone.) There were two memorial tablets on it, one was of course Mr. Cai Bojie, and the other was Mr. Hu Daonan, styled Zhongsheng; (Mr. Daonan was also a revolutionary giant.)</p>
<p>Keting was originally a thatched cottage, but its rafters were made of bamboo. At that time, Mr. Cai passed by this Keting and rested in the Keting overnight. The bamboo rafters of Keting had been bitten by many holes by wasps, and the wind blew into the holes, making a whirring sound. Mr. Cai found this sound very novel, and later he created a kind of transverse flute based on the wind sound of the bamboo rafters. (It is commonly said that the bamboo of Keting can be used to make flutes; this is of course a misunderstanding.)</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Mr. Hu Daonan died in an accident. Local people believed that Mr. Hu had contributed to Shaoxing, so they set up a spirit tablet for Mr. Hu in Keting, so this Keting had two owners.</p>
<p>As for the scenery of Keting, it is also not bad. Clear streams surround the pavilion on three sides, and the pavilion stands alone in the lake. Mountains surround it on all sides, not too far and not too near. Looking at it, it looks just like a verdant green ribbon, surrounding Keting. There is a plaza next to the pavilion, surrounded by green willows. Every spring, the green shade is like a tent, and there is an endless stream of tourists in February and March.</p>
<p>The above history of Keting is based on the stone tablet in front of the pavilion, so of course it will not be wrong.</p>
<p>Finally, after Mr. Cai Bojie died, Keting was changed to Mr. Cai's ancestral hall, which very few people know, so I also wrote it above. (The above is also based on the stone tablet)</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Zhuo)</p>
<p>Prophecy is a most humorous thing: For example, the new fashion that is popular this year is the 1935 style; if someone predicts that the most popular outfit in the world in 1936 will be fully armed, towering military uniforms!</p>
<p>Mr. C's girlfriend is getting married, which is a great joy. His heart is like a knocked over jar of mixed tastes, and he can't tell what it tastes like. Her mother even came to invite him to the wedding banquet, but how could Mr. C bear to swallow it? He had to plead that he had not been feeling well recently and often had ["heartache"].</p>
<h3>Socks</h3>
<p>— Sha Yongcai</p>
<p>Socks are universally recognized as a necessity in daily clothing. But when the thermometer advances to eighty or ninety degrees, modern girls begin to bare their legs, and it is when Autumn begins that socks become active on their six inches of round skin.</p>
<p>Before China opened up, only cloth socks were popular in our country. At that time, if you wore a pair of snow-white bamboo cloth socks and a pair of thick-soled shoes made in Du, that was already pretty enough. However, since trade between China and foreign countries, the power of cloth socks has been defeated by foreign socks, so the sound of foreign socks foreign socks was the most fashionable catchphrase at that time. Until now, although most of the socks are manufactured by Chinese factories, and not all are sold from foreign countries, the name "foreign socks" still lingers in the mouths of some people.</p>
<p>The more advanced the world's civilization, the more luxurious people's material enjoyment. This is an undeniable fact. Taking socks as an example: the girls in the city often spend five, six or more dollars on the slightest of socks, which is more than a thousand times more than a pair of cloth socks in the past! No wonder the average poor scholar would be amazed and sing [A girl's pair of socks is half a year's grain for a poor man].</p>
<p>A friend told me that [The locals in Zhuji, Zhejiang, have a special kind of hair socks, which are woven from hair. Because hair is smooth and strong, it can be worn for more than ten years without breaking, and it does not need to be washed often]. Look! How economical and durable this kind of sock is. It is truly an outstanding product among indigenous products.</p>
<p>The neighboring Yamato nation in the east, living in this century, still retains the scenery of cloth socks. Although their conservatism is not worth emulating, their spirit is worthy of our admiration.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Su Yuan Chrysanthemum Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Chrysanthemum Fanatic</p>
<p>The west wind is cold, the leaves are falling, and it is the season of red maples. The annual Chrysanthemum and Goldfish Exhibition at the Wu Wangtai Garden has been held in the branch park since November 9th. Fine chrysanthemums and famous fish are arranged in full array. Ladies and gentlemen from all over the city are visiting in droves. The fragrance of clothes and the shadows are extremely lively. The lonely park in late autumn has revived the magnificent scenery of early summer. There are many kinds of chrysanthemums, and their shapes are different. Some are rich and dripping with color, while others are elegant and pleasant; some petals are curled, while others are stretched out at will; people linger and appreciate them endlessly. Among the items for sale, the violet potted plants from the Guiyou Art Planting Society and those cultivated in the park are the most prized. The forests are cleverly colored, all old varieties of Yangzhou, and the plants are difficult to see. The room displaying goldfish is even more crowded with viewers. The colorful egg phoenix fish in violet pots, the fighting fish, and the various colored pearl fish from the Si Jing Xiang Sun family are the most distinctive. They are colorful, dancing, and the pearls are clear and dense, making people leisurely think of fish music. In the corner of the room are also antiques and ornaments from the Guiyou Society, arranged on several tables. Among them are potted banana fruits and vegetables for offerings, and an ancient bronze fish pond, planted with jade bamboo, storing water to raise fish in between, which is quiet and pleasant, making full use of artistic skills. I jot down a note to record these fleeting moments. (A return gift)</p>
<h3>御香縹緲録</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The room to the right was Empress Dowager's private Buddhist hall. The Empress Dowager was a devout Buddhist by nature. She had a porcelain Guanyin statue that she piously worshiped almost all year round. She had already sent someone to bring it here. Sometimes she also liked to recite scriptures, so there had to be such a quiet room. The room to the right of the side hall was the Empress Dowager's bedroom.</p>
<p>In the center of the side hall, the very first room we entered, was a small, not very tall round table. The table itself was nothing particularly remarkable, but on it was a set of dominoes that the Empress Dowager loved to use daily. Before the Empress Dowager's departure, this set of dominoes was stored in a side hall in the Summer Palace. The day before departure, we saw it safely stored there, and we never heard the Empress Dowager order it to be brought to Fengtian. But the minds of the chief eunuchs, such as Li Lianying and Zhang De, were exceptionally clever. They thought that the Empress Dowager might suddenly think of this set of dominoes when she arrived in Fengtian, so they secretly sent someone to bring them. We didn't know about this. So, as soon as everyone entered, their gaze focused on this set of dominoes. The Empress Dowager seemed quite surprised, but she knew that it was a good intention of her servants to anticipate her wishes.</p>
<p>Next to the door connecting to the bedroom was another large table, which was the Empress Dowager's official desk. A set of writing brush, inkstone, and other necessary stationery, such as ink paste and water dropper, as well as different kinds of paper, were neatly arranged on it. (173)</p>
<h3>杮與香蕉</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>(1) Persimmon</p>
<p>The persimmon, rottenly crimson, is sweet and delicious to eat. I am particularly fond of it. Its leaves are like camellia leaves but thicker and larger. It blooms tiny yellowish flowers at the summer solstice. In autumn, it bears fruit, about two inches in diameter, green in color. When picked and stored, they ripen into a delightful red color in a few days, resembling tomatoes. The best way to store persimmons is to mix them with papayas or betel nuts, which can avoid a涩 taste. Those produced in Qingzhou are even better. There are many of these on Wu Mountain in my hometown of Wu. The large ones are called "Bronze Basin Persimmons," and the small ones are called "Golden Bowl Persimmons," named after their shape.</p>
<p>The ancients said: [Persimmon has seven wonders: 1. The tree is long-lived; 2. The leaves provide ample shade; 3. No birds nest in it; 4. Few insects damage it; 5. The frosted leaves are beautiful to look at; 6. It is a fine fruit to eat; 7. The fallen leaves are thick and fertile.] Both Erya Yi and Xiyang Zazu record this.</p>
<p>In the past, when Zheng Qian served as a Guangwen scholar, he studied calligraphy but suffered from a lack of paper. He knew that the Ci'en Temple had several rooms of cloth covered with persimmon leaves, so he borrowed a monk's room to live in and took red leaves every day to study calligraphy. Over the years, he covered almost everything with leaves. This story is a fine tale of the literary world, enough to last for thousands of years.</p>
<p>A persimmon tree grafted with fruit roots three times will bear fruit without seeds, which is most delightful.</p>
<p>Take large persimmons, peel them, press them flat, and expose them day and night. When dry, put them in a bag. Wait for white frost to appear, then take them out. They taste extremely sweet and are called persimmon cakes. Eating them can cure hemorrhoids, like figs.</p>
<p>Persimmons and crabs should not be eaten together, as this can cause poisoning and illness. Therefore, Chen Yunzhu's persimmon poem also contains the line "crab roe is slightly to be avoided."</p>
<p>There is another kind of persimmon called a "pí shì", which has hair on its leaves. Its fruit is blue-black and exceptionally astringent. Its juice is extracted and is commonly called "persimmon lacquer," which is applied to paper umbrellas and flat bones to resist dampness and prevent decay.</p>
<p>The "Notes from the Cowherd's Thatched Cottage" contains a section on the "Four Persimmon Pavilion," which says: [Qiantun Township in Kunshan County is a remote and small market town. Gu Tinglin (Gu Yanwu) was born here. At the place where Mr. Gu studied, he personally planted four persimmon trees. Over three hundred years, the roots and trunks have been destroyed. In the XinHai year of the Xuantong era, Liang Jie'an, a Taishi (senior scholar) from Guangdong, came to Qiantun on business. He used his own funds to rebuild the Ancestral Hall of Loyalty and Filial Piety, replanting four persimmon trees in the courtyard, and engraved a stone tablet, which was embedded in the wall. In the YiChou year, I made a special trip to visit the ancestral hall, browsing and admiring it, filled with endless emotion.]</p>
<p>Wang Xishen, a senior, was also very fond of persimmons. In his poem "Autumn Traces on the Lake," he mentioned them, saying: [The lake and mountains are beautifully adorned in the land of water and clouds, a small boat with a melon-shaped hull rocks in the sunset, a scene of autumn light is beyond description, green water caltrop, red persimmons, and yellow osmanthus.] A note says: [As soon as I unloaded my luggage, I sold a small boat and went for a swim in the lake. Flowers in vases were arranged on the table, the scent filled the nose, and seasonal fruits from the lake were arranged on the table, fresh water caltrop, vibrant green and tender fragrance, more than soft peeled water chestnuts. Persimmons are written as a famous product of Hangzhou, with the name of Southern Mountain Persimmons and Northern Mountain Chestnuts. I have a stomach illness and have always loved this thing, red and luscious, reflecting each other and adding to the beauty. The scenery recorded in Hong Beijiang's Preface to the Poem "Boating on Baiyun Stream in Autumn" is reminiscent of this encounter.] This fine fruit has received this praise, making its reputation ten times greater.</p>
<p>Persimmon has the honorific title of "Waiting for Frost." See the "Tian Lu Yun": [When Emperor Gao was still an ordinary person, he passed through Shengchai Village. The frosted persimmons were ripe. After eating them, he passed this tree and dismounted to cover it with his red robe, saying, "I treat you as a senior waiting for frost." Or called "Waiting for Frost"], so is the persimmon also a vestige of the imperial system? Laugh.</p>
<p>(2) Banana</p>
<p>Bananas are produced in hot regions. They are the fruit of the banana plant, with very large leaves and pale yellow flowers. The fruit is four to five inches long and about an inch in diameter, with each segment attached to the others, fragrant and sweet, also called Gan Jiao. The large bananas of Siam are a foot long, fat and unmatched, eating one can make a person full. Therefore, getting two or three bananas a day allows one to eat and be satisfied, drum one’s belly, and play, not like the people of Huxu.</p>
<p>Bananas moisten the intestines and stimulate the appetite, so adding a little of its liquid to aerated water or fruit dew, and in ice, is especially palatable.</p>
<p>People in Guangdong have what is called banana rice, which is made by selecting the best bananas, peeling off their skin, placing them in a stone mortar, pounding them with a pestle, mixing them with glutinous rice and lard in a large bowl, steaming it, and adding longan pulp, which is better than the eight-treasure rice in restaurants.</p>
<p>My colleague Fan Yanqiao once told a story about bananas and wine that was absolutely hilarious: [Mr. Chen Peiren went to Yueshan one year to visit the old Song Dynasty ruins, the remnant mountains and remaining waters, a vast expanse of desolation. He asked the locals, who said that there was a National Mother Temple on the mountain, which was dedicated to Empress Yang. After climbing up, he wanted a glass of wine to worship, and he gave a piece of silver to a colleague, ordering him to bring wine. The official was from Guangdong and mistook wine for bananas, and after a while, he brought a huge plant, with bunch after bunch, all bananas. So he laughed and shared the bananas with the official. Later, when Sun Yat-sen heard about this, every time he ate and drank with Mr. Peiren, he would tease him about it.]</p>

<h3>The Education Bureau Instructs Schools to Take Proper Precautions</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed the schools under its jurisdiction: According to a report from Chen Shao Xing, the principal of the Municipal Dongming Elementary School, the report details the circumstances of the students being kidnapped, and asks to transfer the information to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for severe punishment, and to add police posts to maintain public security. The school student Chen Qiling of the third grade was forced to board a pre-parked vehicle on the way back to school at 12:30 pm on the 5th, and ran wildly towards Fuyou Road. Fortunately, he was met by the school students and reported back to the school. The school immediately assisted teachers and school workers to track down until near Xiaoshijie, before capturing it. The student was already powerless and unable to speak. According to this action, it is clearly a kidnapper. In addition to notifying the student's family to take it back, the bandit and the driver were immediately sent to Section 2 of the 1st District, please investigate together to warn the future. The school is located at the junction of the Chinese and French roads, with crisscrossing paths and a mixed population.

In addition to the school's teachers and students strictly preventing it, it is specially requested that your bureau transfer the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to severely punish the criminals in accordance with the law and add police posts to maintain the safety of young students, which is extremely illegal. There are many schools and students in this city. If they are not severely punished, what will be the consequences? According to the previous situation, in addition to transferring a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate according to law, all schools must be ordered to take proper precautions to ensure safety. This order,</p>

In addition to more than 40 people including Dr. Jiang Kanghu, Wang Xiaowen, Tao Baichuan, Wu Xiu, Lu Hailan, Shou Zhenzuo, Zhu Bofang, Yang Zunxuan, and Xu Taochun, there were also representatives from the Beijing Alumni Association Wang Jianyu and representatives from the Hangzhou Alumni Association Fang Xiaokuan, etc. First, Chairman Zhu Junxi reported, saying that the important agenda of this conference is how to promote the realization of the Kanglu lecture plan. Although Dr. Jiang is over half a century old, he has not slackened in his academic research and service to the community. At a time when the country is in crisis and the government and the public are vigilant, literature should be particularly promoted. Today, the doctor spares no effort to engage in academic guidance, which not only benefits young students, but also benefits the future of the Chinese literary community more greatly. We have followed the doctor for many years and should do our best to assist the doctor in this move and make it flourish. As for how to support, we hope that the students will express their opinions more. Then Tao Jun Baichuan proposed two points: First, Kanglu's lectures should focus on correspondence courses to facilitate distant learners. Second, the origin of the lectures can be in the name of the Nanda Alumni Association. This was unanimously approved. Finally, Jin Jun Dingyi proposed to temporarily collect a special fee of one yuan from the members, which was also passed, and Yang Jun Zunxuan was responsible for collecting it from the students. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

Afterward, attendees viewed the achievements of various departments. The auditorium downstairs was filled with plaques, mirror screens, couplets, vertical scrolls, presented by alumni and various sectors. The podium was full of silver shields and silver cups, creating a magnificent scene.</p>
<p>The first room on the second floor was the kindergarten achievements department. The self-made teaching aids were exquisitely crafted. Various achievements of the kindergarten students were also remarkable. Among them, the miniature model of a family home was meticulously arranged and lifelike. The chrysanthemum paper crafts on the four walls were also vibrant and eye-catching. The second room was the fine arts department. The items were numerous and dazzling. In fine arts, watercolors and patterns were excellent. In handicrafts, plaster, gold, wood, bamboo, rattan, and other crafts were the most outstanding. Other crafts such as embroidery, sewing, paper-cutting, flower-making, and waste utilization were also exquisite and delicate. The third room was the national mathematics department. Abacuses and children's works were displayed throughout the room. Among them, the arithmetic charts were particularly brilliant. The children's presentations were substantial.

These achievements were gathered in one room, making it particularly wonderful. In the Humiliation Eradication and National Salvation section, statistics on the map of donated lost territories and depictions of Japanese atrocities were shocking. Other self-compiled teaching materials for each subject and implementation reports were suitable for the new education, demonstrating that the school authorities were effective in their daily management and diligent in their work, hence the achievements. In the afternoon, various recreational activities were performed, with humorous acrobatics and witty remarks. In addition to the school's students performing more than twenty programs, the municipal Bide and Yude schools and alumni also participated.</p>

<h3>On Realism</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Recently, the resurgence of realism has swept the literary circles of various countries. The rise of this upsurge is closely linked to the inheritance of legacies and the formal study of naturalistic writers. Originally, literary circles in various countries unanimously believed that the legacies of realist writers such as Shakespeare, Balzac, and Zola were worth inheriting. Because they all faithfully reflected reality without bending it, just as Romain Rolland said: [The artist's art is a mirror that truthfully reflects reality society.]</p>
<p>In fact, the artist's art is indeed a mirror, but I feel that this mirror must be polished by the artist's progressive worldview. Simply being a mirror would make it like the realism of the great British novelist James Joyce.</p>
<p>In Japan and our country, there is a phenomenon of swallowing the legacies of realist writers whole, especially regarding the understanding of realism, believing that simply reflecting reality is enough to qualify. Learning the whole method of Balzac, Shakespeare, etc., is actually not the most inferior method, because the art accomplished by this method only exposes the licentiousness of the citizens, but it cannot become the best method most adapted to the current society.</p>
<p>I have seen promotions for studying Balzac in magazines and newspapers in Japan and Beiping. On the surface, it is right to let writers learn from our greatest realist writer, but in reality, it is not very appropriate.</p>
<p>Balzac's greatness is not only due to his faithful reflection of reality, but also due to his understanding of the materials of reality. His greatness lies in his ability to clearly tell readers the historical mission and the historical progress. In his works, there is the epoch-making historical mandate of the decline of the aristocratic class and the rise of the new bourgeoisie. We can indeed learn Balzac's method of realism, but can we learn the historical mission that he endowed in his art? Our realism must be built on our new worldview.</p>
<p>Not only that, but some artists regard realism as the best of previous creative methods and completely obliterate the political nature existing in art, such as the writers centered on the Japanese magazine [Reality], such as Kamei Katsuichiro and Kawaguchi Hiroshi, who are practitioners of this claim; I believe that this result can create art that is faithful to reality, but lacking an inherent progressive worldview, it will not touch the reader's heart, and it will not have fulfilled the artist's task to the current world. For this school of realism, I have to cite Joyce as an example!</p>
<p>Joyce's art very faithfully describes the petite bourgeoisie of Ireland. He follows the protagonist to the office to peep, and follows him to the school, pub, and brothel to observe the protagonist's movements, thoughts, feelings, and even from the stomach's movements to the brain's sexual desires. Then he narrates this sequentially without omission. However, has the art accomplished by this become the highest level of art? No, he has not completed the artist's task at all, and it is not a very complete work. Because this is due to the fact that he did not give the totality of life. He has a novel describing the petite bourgeoisie of Ireland rising up in revolt against the sovereignty they hate in 1916; in this novel, the characters Brium and Suilattis and others were all shot dead in the barricades. But did he really depict the true posture of life like a movie? No, because the selection of the object of his film's depiction is prescribed by his viewpoint. Although he selected the worthlessness of the petite bourgeoisie and the characteristic opportunities, he could not see them in the struggle. His method is not called an objective method of life expression, but is simply the selection of life phenomena starting from the petty bourgeois viewpoint without seeing the way out of the crisis of culture.</p>
<p>Recently, Karl Radek in the Soviet Union said some pertinent words about Joyce's realism:</p>
<p>[The task of the artist that Joyce holds is to examine a lump with a microscope, and then project it with a camera. Joyce, he believes that when various movements, thought activities, and human activities are depicted with a camera, the true face of reality is accomplished, and he believes that when this is assembled as a whole, it can present a large deployment diagram.</p>
<p>I have to shout loudly, please do not learn this kind of realism.]</p>
<p>Indeed, Joyce's realism is just examining work, without a historical mission, but how should we take our realism? I said above that the artist should not only reflect art with realism, but also filter it through his own worldview. Therefore, our attitude towards realism is to oppose the work of examining refuse.</p>
<p>November in Tokyo</p>
<h3>Thirteen Rapids</h3>
<p>— Hu Tianyu</p>
<p>[Tomorrow we're passing the Thirteen Rapids.]</p>
<p>This was a snowy evening, as we were preparing to sleep, the words of three sailors to us. The boat was an old awning boat. The awning was already broken beyond recognition, the wind carrying snowflakes through the cracks, the air seemingly colder than outside. The space was small, several people squeezed together, and you felt uncomfortably restricted when you wanted to move. One companion had sighed:</p>
<p>[It's really suffering to be on a boat like this!]</p>
<p>From the day we boarded the boat, the weather turned bad; the snow fell heavily, never stopping. The weather was deadly cold, and some parts of the river were frozen. We hid in the cabin all day and all night, not even daring to look at the bow of the boat. The awning was so low that sitting up meant hitting your head, and even thinking of bending over was too much. Yet, we had spent two days and two nights like this, as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Still in a dream, we heard the sound of [Hai-yo, Hai-yo]. This sound was foreign to us, because in the two days of our water journey, we had heard nothing but the howling of the wind. Today's sudden outburst of [Hai-yo, Hai-yo] made us all very surprised.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the snow cleared, and we were able to go to the bow of the boat to look around. It turned out we had already reached the First Rapid. This rapid was too high, the water shallow above and deep below, so the boat could not be rowed over it no matter what; it had to be lifted by people and pushed down to the lower part of the rapid. The sound of [Hai-yo, Hai-yo] was the call of a dozen or so sailors lifting the first boat into the water to descend the rapid.</p>
<p>They were all standing in the water, their trouser legs rolled up high, but still wearing tattered cotton-padded jackets. Everyone had their backs pressed tightly against the boat, their hands gripping the sides, and each mouth neatly shouted -</p>
<p>[Hai-yo ah-hai - ai...]</p>
<p>And so the boat moved forward clumsily.</p>
<p>Alas! What is this all about? Aren't they cold standing in the water in this cold weather? I wanted to ask the sailors on our boat, but they were gone; later, I found two of them in the group in the water.</p>
<p>Then I remembered: our group of seven boats originally belonged to the same shipping company. They were all colleagues in the same trade, and they had a mutual obligation to help each other.</p>
<p>And so, they lifted the first boat, then the second, the third....</p>
<p>After all seven boats were lifted, the sailors climbed back onto their own boats. Our two also came back: I saw that their legs were like tanned bronze from being soaked in the water, but sweat was streaming down their foreheads.</p>
<p>[This life is really not for humans!]</p>
<p>They shook their heads and said, sighing as the boat set off safely again. Wrapped in cotton blankets, the weather was too cold!</p>
<p>After traveling only half a mile at most, the loud and turbulent sound of the rapids rose again in our ears. This was the Second Rapid. I looked at the sailors at the bow of the boat; they looked at each other silently.</p>
<p>When they approached the edge of the rapid, they jumped into the water again to lift the boat.</p>
<p>And so, they lifted one boat after another, passing one rapid after another.</p>
<p>The Thirteen Rapids were finally completely crossed, and it was already dusk. The sailors finally breathed a sigh of relief, as if they had accomplished a miracle, and began to cook dinner while singing mountain songs.</p>
<p>The sound fell on the dusk river, trembling, desolate, and repressed, and we were all awakened by it to infinite sorrow, but it was so light and quiet.</p>
<h3>The Night at Han Sheng's Brick Kiln (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>The carter, with his hair coiled in a bun, must have just relieved himself, biting a trouser belt as he adjusted his pants outside the door: [Don't you have anything to eat? These gentlemen are reasonable students, they won't take advantage of you. Brother!]</p>
<p>[Really, there's nothing, would your brother lie to you?] The ["middle-aged"] man speaking raised his head and cracked a stiff smile at the carter. His smile was still somewhat youthful, but after the smile faded, he looked even older. This prematurely aged young man gave another silent, dry laugh after a short while. The meaning and motivation of that laugh were completely unfathomable. When he was urged to borrow some food from the village, he wore a confused smile at the side of the oil lamp - a distinctly eerie one.</p>
<p>Someone realized that there were still thirteen people in the room: beside the woman, a child was huddled in a sheepskin. He had probably just woken up and poked his head out from behind his mother's back, mumbling.</p>
<p>[Mom!] He rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>[Don't make noise!]</p>
<p>The child flopped onto the bed, propping up his head and chest with his elbows, sleepily and curiously observing the many guests.</p>
<p>[Start a fire!] The old man ordered.</p>
<p>The people in the room were too lazy to speak, yawning and sniffling, their eyes watery. The woman squatted on the ground, mechanically starting a fire, and the people responded to her lazily - until the water was boiling in the pot.</p>
<p>[What's going on, old man! Still not back...]</p>
<p>After some time, the person who had gone out appeared at the door empty-handed.</p>
<p>[What - nothing?]</p>
<p>[That's right!]</p>
<p>[What - not even a little?] The short soldier opened his eyes wide in disbelief. His neck seemed to grow longer as a result.</p>
<p>[Ah, the whole village doesn't have enough for your gentlemen to have a meal! There's no way, old boss!]</p>
<p>The people fell silent. It wasn't until the big carter volunteered to ride his barebacked horse to find food seven or eight miles away - after the sound of hooves disappeared - that they began to sigh to each other.</p>
<p>[It's a common thing,] the old man said calmly: [In the past, some people even pretended to be poor, but now everyone can sleep with their doors open. If you want to rob, you'll only find it in Erzhang Pit...]</p>
<p>The two soldiers laughed. The one with the flat nose touched the box beside him in the smoky haze.</p>
<p>They leaned listlessly on the bed, drinking water, smoking, and quietly waiting for the sound of hooves. Their conversations were often interrupted by false alarms resembling the sound of hooves. It was not until the carter actually came back with food that they were completely reassured.</p>
<p>Soon, a dinner that was urgently needed by everyone was steaming in the only iron pot, inside which were mixed millet, pumpkin, and sweet potato.</p>
<p>[How fragrant!] The old man squatted on the bed, rubbing his hands, greedily sniffing and sizing up the food. The child also sat up completely, leaning on his mother's shoulder, his dark eyes fixed on the pot of food:</p>
<p>[Do we have some to eat too, Mom!]</p>
<p>The woman gently hushed him, then put her mouth next to her child's ear and whispered for a while.</p>
<p>The carter, staring blankly at the firelight near the stove, suddenly asked the woman for salt, as if startled awake from a dream.</p>
<p>[There isn't any...]</p>
<p>Without salt, the dinner still began in the same way. Because of the lack of bowls, seven people could only wait on the side, swallowing their saliva greedily, embarrassed to look around.</p>
<p>[Alas, it's really bland. There's no soy sauce either, is there?] A student asked, taking off his glasses, which were blurred by the heat, with his left hand.</p>
<p>[It's been more than a year - we haven't even bought soy sauce since last New Year, sir!... ] Feeling embarrassed by the silent watching, the old man took this opportunity to sigh deeply.</p>
<p>The carter and the soldiers took the bowls and chopsticks from the hands of those who had finished eating and filled their own bowls from the pot.</p>
<p>[There's plenty!] The woman looked at the contents of the pot, at the empty bowls, and at the child.</p>
<p>[Eat, old man, brother, sister-in-law, - uh, there's plenty, don't be so polite, eat it while it's hot...]</p>
<p>The old man stared at the swallow's nest on the roof, pretending not to notice, and feigning surprise:</p>
<p>[What! Oh, oh, oh, take your time. You eat first.] He ordered his grandchildren's wives.</p>
<p>And so the large room was filled with the sounds of their eating and drinking.</p>
<p>[How fragrant!] The old man smacked his lips, licking the water droplets on his gray beard. He said to his grandson: [Eat slowly, after being hungry, you should drink more soup first -- how fragrant!] He kept using his eyes, which had become very lively, to scan these generous guests: [--To think that there would be food in the middle of the night, thank goodness! Thank goodness!...]</p>
<p>Moonlight covered the earth. Outside the door, there was only a vast, boundless expanse of dim white. From somewhere came the sound of a mule braying, followed by two or three barks of a dog...</p>
<p>It is said that these are all rare to hear. (The End)</p>
<h3>Vagabond (6)</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>Wiping the right side of his nose, he had no intention of harming them.</p>
<p>[Heh, slippery egg!]</p>
<p>The earthworms had been stolen again. He still watched the fish fry with great interest, rolling over and swimming away. He waited until the fisherman casting the net came, then feigned anger and found someone to talk to:</p>
<p>[Hey, old fellow, this is unfair... There, you should leave a way for them to live. Bah!]</p>
<p>If the net caster ignored him, he would wink strangely, revealing a sly look, and laugh heartily for a while. It was as if something had exploded in his stomach, and he bent over uncontrollably. Only when the fisherman became angry would he rattle on with nonsense.</p>
<p>[People should have a conscience, you know? A conscience!]</p>
<p>He said loudly.</p>
<p>[Send your conscience to the medicine shop... even the hawk won't look at it!]</p>
<p>The man really wanted to run ashore and punch him. A cunning light flashed in his eyes, and he lowered his tone as much as possible and spoke slowly. His crooked nose twitching, he seemed to be saddened by other people's misunderstandings, or pitying that his opponent would be so angry. He muttered:</p>
<p>[It's fishing, old fellow; that's what I said].</p>
<p>The August sun brought an unwelcome drowsiness. He leaned lazily against the willow tree, watching the net casting yelling and falling into the water, and then made a soft, cotton-like rustling sound. The water droplets on the net ropes sparkled uncertainly, and an unspeakable desire and pleasure merged together. The light clouds intertwined with the reed flowers, contrasting sharply with the blue color in the distance. The wind idly swept through the willow tips, making a sound like that from the feet of distant travelers, startling the birds that escaped across the sky.</p>
<p>[Sell your water chestnuts, some people are waiting to die.] The fisherman raised his eyes from the net rope and wiped his chest. Immediately, his eyes, which could see through the bottom of the water, spotted a decent carp caught in the net, and he carefully fixed on the vortex on the surface of the water. He was even more moved. Joy and excitement mingled in his heart, and he groaned with shortness of breath:</p>
<p>[I, um, I bought some too... you are wronged... tricked only once... curse, curse, curse...]</p>
<p>[Bought some? Don't buy them again in the future... Ha! What a beautiful salmon!] (young carp)</p>
<p>The fisherman ignored him and cast the net. He angrily threw his fishing rod aside and yelled strangely:</p>
<p>[You are the ones who kill people, blocking all ten paths!] Here he did not separate people and fish. [Do I pull them? Pull them and say - water chestnuts, take out the money! If you don't buy them, you'll be shot!... But you, ha! Stole my business. Bah!]</p>
<p>He took up his fishing rod and struck the water, the long ripples spreading out, and the fish fry sank in a daze.</p>
<p>People on the streets are often prone to strange characters, pretending to be capable when they are incompetent, and falsely claiming to be loyal when they are cunning. He blinked his round, small eyes, thinking: conscience and swindler.</p>
<p>Because proverbs and the current situation were linked together, he traced back to the fact that fish also have swindlers: big fish grow fat by eating small fish, and the way they eat is mostly by pretending to be dead, tricking small fish and shrimp to swim nearby... This is a swindler!</p>

<h3>Overseas Silver Prices Soar, Gold Price Dips Only Three Yuan Ninety</h3>
<p>Large Short Covering Causes Price Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was characterized by soaring silver prices, strange initial price drops, and large short positions being aggressively covered by major players, which helped to stabilize the market price. The exchange rate also tightened due to Central Bank intervention, creating a unique situation of initial weakness followed by strength, which was unexpected. Early in the morning, the market was weakened by the extraordinarily strong overnight exchange rate, coupled with sharp increases in US dollar rates against London, with both near-term and forward rates rising by 1.5 pence. The US dollar rose by 0.375, the British pound rose against the US dollar by 1/125, the US dollar depreciated against the British pound by 0.5, the British pound rose against the French franc by 28 points, the US dollar depreciated slightly against the French franc by 0.25, and London gold fell by 1.5 pence. Market sentiment was extremely weak, and pre-market trading fell to 60 and 61 yuan. Dalian Bank and Fuxingyong and others immediately entered the market to buy at the low, which pushed the price up. However, because the price was cheap, supply was abundant, and the Central Bank announced that the exchange rates for British pounds and US dollars were unchanged, and the customs gold surcharge was reduced by 0.02. This improved market sentiment, and prices gradually rose after the opening. The exchange rate was repeatedly difficult to settle, and US dollar purchases from British pound sales were conducted, pushing the price to around 70 yuan. Banks seized the opportunity to sell at the high price, resulting in a struggle. However, because the underlying trend was strong, there were many low-priced bids, and the situation was extremely chaotic, fluctuating around 70 yuan. After the banks intervened, they reversed and sold, and the Central Bank also provided a slight supply, stabilizing the situation. The Central Bank's silver equalization tax was announced as 8.25%, which was 0.0125 higher than on the previous Saturday. The price fluctuated up and down. However, because the British pound exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling 5.875 pence, banks could apparently import silver with ease, and the overall market sentiment tended to weaken. The gold market subsequently fell. However, because market sentiment remained good, the Central Bank intervened to buy at the low price, which helped to maintain the price and gradually push it up, but there was much fluctuation. Finally, because of a lack of sellers and a tighter exchange rate, the banks also slightly intervened to buy, and market sentiment was originally strong. The year-end trend was very firm. The subsequent market was stable at the opening, and then fell again as large players sold. The banks had a good appetite, and the Central Bank continued to intervene to buy, tightening the exchange rate. Although there was a slight fluctuation mid-way due to the rise of 9 annas in Bombay, the market sentiment was still bullish. The exchange rate helped the buying trend and rose again. Major players took advantage of the high price to sell again, and there was no shortage of suppliers taking advantage of the opportunity. The domestic price was unstable, fluctuating between high and low. In the end, because the exchange rate remained good, Zhejiang and Central banks continued to intervene to buy, and prices gradually rebounded. The second report from Bombay showed a rise of 3 annas, and the market finally showed a state of hesitation. The overall trend was quite healthy. The closing price was slightly lower than before the market closed, but there were many implicit advantages in many ways. A record of the day's market conditions is provided below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 963.5 yuan, which was 13.4 yuan lower than on the previous Saturday. Then, the price fell from 0.04 yuan to 0.033 yuan. Fuxingyong, Dafa Yong, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Yuanmaoyong and others bought in succession. Although there was a slight fluctuation in the middle, the upward trend was very strong. The banks bought US dollar exchange rates, and Chinese merchants also had an appetite for buying. The price gradually rose to 70 yuan. Dafa Yongyuan sold, and HSBC sold December shillings for half a penny, falling to 68.2 yuan. Citibank bought February US dollars for 0.3125, Fuxingyong and Qianchangxiang took delivery, rising to 71 yuan. Hengyu and Huixiang sold, gradually falling downstream. Datong sold January US dollars for 0.375, falling to 67.5 yuan. Fuxingyong and Shunmao advanced to 0.097 yuan, Holland sold December US dollars for 0.375 again, and Dalian Gang supplied with Huixiangyuanxing and others, falling back to 0.079 yuan. Fuyu, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Dafa Yong and Tongtaichang took delivery, once rising to 70.5 yuan. The Central Bank sold January US dollars for 0.3225 to Korea, Wanxingyongli, Dadecheng and Tianchengxiang sold to 68.3 yuan, Dafa Yongfuyu took delivery, rising to 70.1 yuan again. After entering the market, Hengyu and Fuxingyong sold first and then bought, the silver equalization tax rose to 8.25%, and rose from within 67 yuan to 0.095 yuan. However, the increase in the equalization tax was calculated based on a British pound exchange rate of 1 shilling and 5.875 pence, which was about 0.015 pence different from the market price. Banks could export silver, and the general sentiment fluctuated. Fuxingyong, Yuanyi, Hengxing, Tianfeng, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, Richang, Tongchun, Yuanchangyong and others sold one after another, falling to 0.052 yuan. However, Chinese merchants still bought, and the Central Bank also bought January US dollars for 0.4375. Market sentiment remained stable. Daxingyong, Hengxing, Dingkang, Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang and others took delivery one after another, rising back to 0.097 yuan. Hua Bi sold February US dollars for 0.3125, Fuxingyong and Hengyu sold to 0.076 yuan, Fuxing, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Richang, Dafa Yong and others still bought. Although Qianchangxiang sold, Citibank bought January US dollars for 0.25, fluctuating and rising to 71.5 yuan. Fuxingyong and Tianfeng sold, falling to within 70 yuan. In the end, because the market sentiment was bullish and there were not many suppliers, Renfayong, Hengyu, Qingyu, Tianchengxiang and others competed to buy, rising to 73 yuan, and then became a state of hesitation. The noon close was 972.6 yuan, and it continued to rise after the market closed.</p>
<p>The aftermarket opened at 973 yuan, then 0.036 yuan, McGary sold January shillings for 0.375, Fuxingyong, Yongli, Qingyu, Yuanmaoyong and Dafa Yong sold, falling to 0.012 yuan. Dalian Gang, Hengyu and Yongli took delivery, rising to 0.03 yuan. Fuxingyong, Yuanchangyong and Yongli sold, Bombay rose 9 annas, and fell to 0.013 yuan again. Hengyu, Fuyu, Qingyu, Richang, Zhentai, Yicheng and others came in to buy, and the Central Bank suddenly intervened to buy January US dollars for 0.125 and shillings for 0.375. Before long, it was difficult to settle, and it rose to 0.055 yuan. Huixiang, Fuxingyong, Zhentaichang, Zhaofengchang and Hengyong sold, gradually falling downstream, falling to 0.012 yuan. Hua Bi bought February US dollars for 0.125, Yifengyong, Fuxingyong, Yuanchangyong, Dafa Yong and others entered the market, gradually rebounding to 0.038 yuan. The second report from Bombay showed a rise of 3 annas, Hengyu, Tianfeng and Dafa Yong sold, falling again to 0.017 yuan. Zhengchang, Yuanyi and others took advantage of the low price to buy in, the situation remained stable, and the closing price rose to 973 yuan. After the market closed, Shunmao and Tongchun and others supplied and were slightly weak. The highest price during the day was 975.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 963.3 yuan, a fluctuation of 12.2 yuan. In the end, it fell by 3.9 yuan compared to before the market closed.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, fell to 989.4 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was about 16 yuan less, which was about 3 yuan more than the previous Saturday, November old standard, with HSBC's US dollar exchange rate rising to 33.875 yuan, a combined standard gold price of 1002 yuan. The registered price for this month was 973 yuan, and the price for December was 973 yuan. The morning supplementary water price was 973 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary water price was the same. The price of pure gold was about 8.5 yuan higher, with a listed price of 972 yuan. There was still a lack of transactions in the market, and the price of Tianjin goods was about 9.5 yuan higher. There was also a lack of transactions in the swap market. In terms of the situation, the short side in the December/January swap market needs to provide premiums, but it all depends on whether the chips are crowded and whether the buyers are encouraged. There are only 70 strips left in this month's strips, with a total of seven long sides and two short sides.</p>
<p>In the market trading, the short side was very active in buying. In summary, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Renfayong, Fu'an, Hengxing, Shengda, Futaiheng, Yingxiang, Shunmao, Mo Fayong, Hongkangyong, Tongfeng, Hengshen, Kanghong, Dachangxiang, Hengyu, Yuanyuyu, Qingyong and others were on the buying side, and Wanxingshunli, Tianfeng, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Fang Bingyu, Fuyu, Tianchengxiang, Yongli, Fuchang, Jiatai, Houchang, Yonghui, Xiangdingtai, Yuanmaoyong, Tongtaichang, Hengchangyong and others were on the selling side. Dafayong, Fuxingyong, Shunmao, Tongchun, Shengda, Zhaofengchang sold in advance, and Changshengyong, Yuanyi, Dingchang and Hengyu bought in advance. Dalian Gang and Wanxing jointly made more than 1900, offsetting more than 1100, Shunli jointly made more than 2100, offsetting more than 500, Guangdong Gang and Hengyu advanced about 300, sold a small number, Shengda advanced more than 400, sold more than 200. The total number of transactions on that day was 49,688 in the morning and 24,502 in the afternoon. The number of chips in December was 25,963, with a total of 56 long sides and 58 short sides.</p>
<p>Public orders were received and resolved on the same day, with Yingbianheng receiving 21 orders and Yifengyongyuanyi and Fuyu each receiving 7 orders. Only 21 orders were received and resolved, with a closing price of 973 yuan.</p>
<h3>Central Bank and Chinese Merchants Compete to Purchase Foreign Exchange, Starting Loose then Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, all US markets were closed. Only London spot exchange rose by one and twenty-five hundredths of a penny. The spot exchange closed lower at 1.875. There was also trading in forward silver, which rose more than two fen. London raw gold remained unchanged. The British pound rose 75 against the US dollar and 15 against the French franc. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of British pounds at one shilling and four and seventy-five hundredths of a penny, and US dollars at 34.875 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the British pound was looser by 3.125 and the US dollar by 5.625. After the opening, it immediately tightened, mainly because the Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound and US dollar both unchanged. The customs gold unit only decreased by two percent, and Chinese merchants' sentiment tended to stabilize. The official exchange rates of HSBC were announced, with the British pound rising 1.25 and the US dollar rising 3.75, without much impact. Although the banks were suppressing, Chinese merchants were still buying. The general trend wavered. The equalization tax was announced, rising 1.25 fen. However, because the official British pound rate was significantly higher, the situation at this time was uncertain, and the underlying trend was quite firm. However, the Central Bank took advantage of the low prices to replenish its reserves. After entering the market, it gradually tightened. The market in the afternoon opened flat. Later, the banks reversed and bought US dollars, and the Central Bank came to purchase again. Although Indian silver rose 9.9.9 anna, the process gradually tightened. After this, the situation was uncertain and wavered. However, the banks suppressed US dollars and released British pounds. The Central Bank and Zhejiang banks also purchased, still tending towards tightening. Indian silver rose again by 3.3.2 anna, and the market stabilized. The closing near-term selling price of British pounds was one shilling and four and thirty-one hundred and twenty-five thousandths of a penny, and the US dollar was 34.0625 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the British pound was tighter by 125 thousandths of a penny, and the US dollar was tighter by 25 thousandths of a penny. Chinese merchants bought approximately 400,000 yuan in US dollars and 100,000 pounds in British pounds. Sassoon and the Central Bank continued to absorb.

<h3>Foreign Market Stagnant, Lacking Progress</h3>
<p>Since last month's influence from exports, the Shanghai silver market (yangshi) daily loan interest rate (yang chai) has risen to over one jiao. Currently, this trend has subsided. In addition, the economic downturn has affected all aspects of the financial planning conference (ji hui), so the decline in the Shanghai silver market (yangshi) is to be expected. Yesterday's Shanghai silver market (yangshi) loan interest rate (yang chai) remained at one jiao and two fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day. The "hua tou" (foreign silver for immediate use) with added water, because foreign currency is more widely used, improved by one fen compared to the previous day, consistently trading at five fen. In the morning market, the turnover of daily loan interest rate (chai piao) transactions was relatively high at over 3.4 million, with new transactions exceeding 500,000. In the afternoon market, transactions were 300,000. Transactions in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce (xiao zong hui) totaled 400,000. Foreign silver mortgage loan (yang ya kuan) transactions saw redemptions of over 600,000 and new loans of over 800,000. The banks' settlements were also unusually slow. Foreign banks settled over 1.6 million in bills of exchange (piao kuan), over 2.5 million in various foreign exchange and goods-mortgage miscellaneous payments, 500,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 200,000 in withdrawals. Chinese banks settled over 2 million in bills of exchange (piao kuan), over 3.2 million in various foreign exchange and goods-mortgage miscellaneous payments, over 300,000 in customs duties, 600,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 in withdrawals. Japanese banks settled over 2 million in bills of exchange (piao kuan), over 2.2 million in various foreign exchange and goods-mortgage miscellaneous payments, 400,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 300,000 in withdrawals. Money shops (qian zhuang) cleared over 34 million in foreign public orders (yang gong dan), over 3.7 million in foreign currency head transfers (yang hua tou kuan), over 500,000 in various remittance payments, 300,000 in banknotes redeemed, 600,000 issued, 300,000 in cash receipts, 200,000 in customer sources, and 150,000 in disbursements. Furthermore, the total number of clearing items at the local bill clearing house on the 13th was 8,458,186.82 silver dollars, including 4,320,868.63 silver dollars in cash and 4,137,318.19 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Currency Fluctuates Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars (xiao yang) traded at 831 yuan in the morning market, and then changed to 831.5 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in a slight increase of only five jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 7,000 jiao in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars (xiao yang) were the same at 748 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, with no change from the previous day. The transaction volume was 90,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins (gang yuan) traded at 320,000 cash, a slight decrease of 500 cash compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 36,800 strings of cash, equivalent to 11,500 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities Hovered All Day, Market Condition Vague, Bond Results Show Softening</h3>
<p>Except for the Demobilization and Troop Reduction 19 Customs Bonds, a Slight Dip Across the Board</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange entered another wavering path, comparatively showing signs of fatigue. The market mostly traded in the No. 11 firm, with heavy selling of deferred demobilization bonds and buying of consolidated tax bonds. Both buying and selling were quite active. On the selling side, there were more scattered sales, such as of Nos. 4 and 53, but selling was not very heavy. However, retail selling was extremely lively. The bullish trend showed a tendency to reverse. Except for the opening session in the morning, trading was extremely quiet thereafter. The future still cannot avoid continued wavering. Yesterday's events: at the opening, the current month demobilization bonds rose sharply by four and a half jiao, but the deferred contracts immediately fell from high to low due to the activity of the No. 11 firm. The trend, affected by this blow, immediately changed direction. After that, although the No. 11 firm was still buying consolidated salt tax bonds, there was already an oversupply, so tax bonds fell by two or three fen. In the second session, Nos. 4 and 53, among others, sold, and the current month demobilization bonds fell sharply by half a yuan, with the remainder also down by five fen to one jiao, to two or three jiao. The afternoon was relatively chaotic, with trading also light and fluctuations also vague and uncertain. Most of the front listings were slightly better by one or two jiao, and after the salt tax bonds, slightly lower by one or two jiao. The closing was the opposite of the previous session, with the front listings slightly lower by one or two jiao and the back listings slightly firmer. Throughout the day, only 96 were relatively stable. The market price results, except for demobilization and troop reduction 19 customs bonds that were slightly better by five fen to one jiao, the rest were slightly weaker by five fen to one jiao to two or three jiao or so. The total transaction volume was estimated at 13.3 million yuan, with 20 shares of stock. The resulting price changes are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Yarn and Cotton Continue, Inventory Shrinking</h3>
<p>Auction Yarn Morale Turns Upward</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, with a slight increase in prices. Demand from current yarn customers is still maintainable. Many say that the inventory of yarn has decreased, leading to a high market sentiment. It is observed that there are more buyers in the market, so the market price is quite high. However, according to some, the Nikkei Foreign Firm's (Ri Xin Yang Hang) short positions still have no intention of covering. The future still depends on actual sales to shrink the inventory.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Market Short Covering Activities</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn auction market, the market atmosphere was tighter due to the closure of the US cotton market. Sellers were lacking. All months increased by three to four jiao. Up to the second and third auctions, it was heard that the fall in gold prices was not fierce, and the market conditions were still high. Short covering was heavier in the current month, increasing by one yuan and three jiao, while far months increased by eight to nine jiao to one yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that current yarn sales were still good. The opening market momentum was still strong. However, at the second and third auctions, it suddenly turned softer due to the liquidation by Da Ji's long positions. Each month slightly fell by one, two, or three jiao. The total daily transactions were estimated at 34,700 bales. It was found that Da Ji sold 4,700 bales, Yuan Da 1,100 bales, Ming De 450 bales, Geng Feng 450 bales, Yuan De 2,700 bales, Da Chang 400 bales, Yi Chang 300 bales, Yu Kang 500 bales, Jun Chang 700 bales, Chang Yu 350 bales, and Chong An 400 bales. Da Fu bought 1,250 bales, Tong Ji 450 bales, Heng Yi 750 bales, Da Feng 850 bales, Jun Chang 400 bales, Ren Feng 550 bales, Yuan Yi 2,150 bales, Run Kang 2,950 bales, Shen Chang 1,100 bales, Heng De 1,550 bales, and Shen Ji 700 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Continue with a Weak 1,600 Bales</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, various customers bought 1,581 bales today. The market price increased by five jiao. The claimed purchase amounts are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin 290, Guangdong 255, Hankou 10, Sichuan 360, Shantou 160, Yunnan 26, Inland 320, Peers 124, Luzhou 10, Henan 2</p>
<h3>Expecting a Strong Rise in US Cotton, Auction Cotton Buyers are Very Active</h3>
<p>Cotton turned upward. Although exchange rates rose, the fall in gold prices was not strong. Moreover, many expect that there will be a large rise in US cotton today. Therefore, morale has turned tight. Supply is dry. Short covering activities have pushed the market price upward.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao (auction cotton) Turns Up Three Jiao and a Half</p>
<p>At the opening of the auction cotton market, although silver prices rose, the fall in gold prices was not severe. It was expected that US cotton would rise sharply yesterday, so it triggered buyer activity. The market price reversed upward. However, Yuan Da continued to sell, resulting in each month rising two or three jiao. In the afternoon, the situation was still high, and the longs increased their purchases, with each month rising again by five fen to one jiao. The total daily transactions were estimated at 67,300 dan. It was found that Da Fu sold 1,200 dan, Mei Ji 1,000 dan, Da Ji 3,800 dan, Yuan Da 5,100 dan, Chang Yu 1,100 dan, Yi Chang 2,300 dan, Yi Kang 1,800 dan, Jun Chang 1,100 dan, and Tong Xing 1,400 dan. Da Feng bought 3,900 dan, Shen Chang 2,500 dan, Jun Chang 3,100 dan, Heng De 5,200 dan, Run Kang 3,000 dan, De Ji 1,100 dan, Ji Feng 2,000 dan, Ren Feng 1,200 dan, Chang Feng 1,900 dan, Xin Cheng 1,600 dan, and Chang He 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Applying to Purchase a Large Batch of Raw Cotton</p>
<p>Current cotton sales are fairly active. Shenxin Factory (Shen Xin Chang) purchases are relatively robust. Sources include 4,944 bales of Tonghua:</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 39.75 Shenxin Factory Purchase 3,000 Bales Delivered to the Factory</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Yarn Auction Buying and Selling Lineup</h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants are the Largest Sellers</p>
<p>Financial Circles are the Largest Buyers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn Market Exchange’s auction yarn inventory, as of November 12, shows that the November contracts traded at 29,700 bales, the December contracts at 46,850 bales, the January contracts at 63,150 bales, the February contracts at 56,100 bales, the March contracts at 51,550 bales, and the April contracts at 19,300 bales, for a total of 266,650 bales. Japanese merchants and manufacturers are the main sellers, while financial circles account for the majority of buyers. The largest long and short positions are excerpted below (unit: bales).</p>
<h3>US Cotton Closed, British and Indian Cotton Announced Price Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was closed. British cotton futures rose five points. Indian cotton, due to purchases by European exporters, Japanese merchants, and market operators, was strong. Pingle rose one rupee, Aomu La rose three rupees, and Bairo Creek rose 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (November 12 telegram).</p>
<h3>Grain, Flour, and Wheat All Fell</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the price of foreign wheat was used. Chicago was closed, with no market. Canada was slightly lower by two or three jiao. When the price was opened, due to the relationship between the factory's fixed price of foreign wheat, morale was generally sluggish (or it was rumored that the factory had not actually fixed the price, but rather it was the sales promotion of foreign firms). Trading both within and outside the industry was simultaneously quiet. Near-term futures were slightly lower by about one fen, while far-term futures, because the factory had not sold off, showed a fixed state. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month had not moved, and once four jiao entered the customs, falling to as low as three jiao and nine fen. Subsequently, the industry's morale turned better, and the factory released very few numbers. Each month gradually became stable. Considering that the rice market has remained firm recently, it is not impossible that the subsequent market will be stabilized. The current month fell by 7.5%, December rose by 2.5%, January and February fell by 5%, and March was unchanged.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, it was also due to foreign wheat prices. Therefore, when the price was opened, morale was exceptionally cold, and transactions were not very smooth. There were no trades in the current month, and only sporadic trades in deferred contracts. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to the fatigue in the flour market and the possibility of daily increases in the exchange rate, morale both within and outside the industry was cheerful. As a result, the current month fell by three fen, December fell by two fen, January fell by one fen, and February fell by three fen. The current wheat market has entered a slump. With the standard step being small and foreign wheat being peddled, it may be necessary to lower prices a little to achieve sales.</p>
<h3>Yuan Rice and Liquor Still in Strong Demand</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for various customers have not yet been robust, remaining at only about 30 firms, with a total of nearly 5,000 shi of goods. Moreover, continuous rain has made morale high. Sellers' asking prices continue to rise. From the opening of the market until the closing, although sales were normal, only a few dozen bales were sold, but prices were able to rise by one or two fen. The prices of late rice such as Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and Fengjing all increased by several fen to over one jiao, and the prices of japonica and wild white rice from Changbang, Su Tong, and Nan Gang also increased by varying degrees. Various colors such as Du Yang, Jian Yin Yuan, etc., all showed good prospects.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived from various towns and villages along the river. There were over 120 to 130 boats in the river. Various goods in the market were sold. New japonica rice, old white rice, new yuan rice, new mutton rice, Du Jian rice, thin rice all sold briskly. New and old Bu Ke Jian rice, broken japonica rice, and Yin Yuan rice were slow to move. However, old white rice and Yin Yuan rice were still in strong demand by liquor producers. The market price for new japonica and thin rice increased by about one jiao, and the price for old white rice and Yin Yuan rice increased by one or two jiao. The price for new mutton rice, early rice, and new and old Bu Ke Jian rice was stable, without much change.</p>
<h3>Saigon April Futures Opened</h3>
<p>– Zhejiang is very Active in Purchasing Rice –</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xiang rice was very popular for inland sales. Local sales were also good. Therefore, even when large quantities arrived at ports such as Changsha, Hankou, and Shashi, the market remained firm. Most of the sales were inland, especially to Zhejiang customers. This is because this year's drought in Zhejiang Province has affected the autumn harvest. Orders for foreign rice have continued to arrive, and foreign merchants are particularly eager to sell. Xiang rice, however, is experiencing repeated price increases due to Zhejiang's eagerness to purchase. Currently, there is a relatively large arrival, which may temporarily stabilize the market. However, sales have not yet slowed down. Yesterday, 2,775 bags of Xiang rice, 3,225 bags of Hankou rice, and 5,900 bags of various Shashi rice were opened, totaling nearly 12,000 bags.</p>
<p>In recent days, foreign rice has been arriving from Siam and Hong Kong without interruption. The market inventory is still sufficient. Yesterday, foreign merchants were promoting futures, seeking to sell both future and current goods. Thus, the market price softened slightly. It is estimated that 500 bags of Siam two-three-day delivery No. 1 broken rice, 200 bags of Annam glutinous rice, and 2,200 bags of West Yellow No. 1 rice were opened. Futures for November and March were opened at 300 tons each, which were sales. There were no new transactions recently. However, He Yi sold 1,000 tons, which was the first transaction for the April delivery, with a price of 5.32 yuan (according to the previous day's bid of only 5.30 yuan, yesterday the price increased by two fen on the street). It was divided among five companies including Ding Tai.</p>
<h3>Soybean Transactions Were Quite Numerous Yesterday, Red Grain Prices Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market situation was quite tight and stable. The current source is scarce on both tracks (rail and river), and the owners, seeing the high prices in the producing areas, found that transportation was not profitable, resulting in more sales. The outlet was that Changxi customers resumed activities, so the market price continued to rise by five or six fen. Old soybean factories processed Qingchan soy sauce, so the market price also followed by four or five fen. Transactions included six cartloads of Yingzhou old soybeans, three cartloads of new soybeans, one cartload of Niu Zhuang Zi Mei beans, one cartload of Dalian large-grain beans, one cartload of medium-grain beans, 500 bags of Guide beans, 300 bags of suburban beans, 100 bags of Gao Geng beans, 400 bags of Xin Anzhen beans, two cartloads of Bangbu beans, one cartload of Nanshaoji beans, and two cartloads of Wulongji beans. The current supply of red grain is still scarce. Yesterday, there was only one cartload, with a price of 3.55 yuan. Currently, due to the shortage of goods, the market sentiment is still tight. Two weeks of road freight were more popular, with two cartloads sold at a price of 3.42 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Abundant Production, Weak Sales, Camellia Oil Prices Fall</h3>
<p>New camellia oil has already appeared in various producing areas, and old oil is still abundant everywhere. Moreover, since the soap factories have ceased operations, the candle market is also weaker than in previous years. Hankou had some activity last week due to a purchase of 35 tons by an American merchant, but Machang oil, which once sold for over 14 yuan, has now fallen to 13.67 yuan. Chongjing also fell to 14 yuan, and the situation has weakened again. Because old oil has not been sold out, new goods have arrived, and sales are even worse. It is feared that it will inevitably decline step by step. In Zhejiang Province, the annual harvest in Jinlan and other places is very ripe, and the production volume is already strong. The camellia seeds do not have less moisture than in previous years. It is said that each load can yield 22 jin of white oil and 14 jin of green oil. With the annual harvest abundant, and the purchase price also low, production will undoubtedly be strong. Currently, the oil price in the producing area is only 12.45 yuan per load, which may be difficult to maintain. However, the harvest in Jiaxing area of western Zhejiang is very poor, only 40-50% of last year's harvest, so each pressing workshop has reduced its output by half, and the total output will also have to be reduced by half. Compared to previous years, before and after the Double Ninth Festival, traders from Jiaxing area would inevitably come to Shanghai to pre-sell goods, but this year there is silence. Because the production volume is low, everyone is afraid to pre-sell. However, there are still a total of 3,000 pieces of old Benche camellia oil, and there are reports of abundant harvests everywhere. The lack of candles in the corner of Jiaxing is feared that the new goods may not be very scarce in the future. Moreover, Jiang and Zhejiang provinces are also experiencing drought, making it difficult for candle sales to be as high as in previous years.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Overcoat Woolen Fabrics, and Winter Cold Have Already Fallen</h3>
<p>All Western-style overcoat woolen fabrics, both high-end and low-end, have recently shown fatigue and lower prices. Except for sample orders from piece goods retailers, the actual sales have already passed the halfway point due to the cold weather. Tailors are busy with overcoat projects and have gradually stopped purchasing various overcoat woolen fabrics. However, the fabric head goods such as fabric and pants twill, the Sykes, and the newly popular Harris tweed are still selling well, and sales are daily.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Chonghui Discusses the Scope of Criminalizing Adultery</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiang Hui Ruo of the Law and Political Science College</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Chonghui believes that Article 239 of the draft criminal code criminalizes a married woman who commits adultery, but does not criminalize a married man who commits adultery. He believes that this indeed violates the principle of equality between men and women. However, criminalizing a married man who commits adultery with the same penalty is also difficult to implement in practice, because after this law is implemented, those who take concubines will all be criminal offenders. More than 30% of people in our country take concubines. If they are also subject to the same punishment, I am afraid that our national prisons will not be able to hold all the married men who commit adultery. Therefore, Mr. Wang advocates that married women or married men who commit adultery should be regulated within the scope of civil law and not be regarded as criminal offenders. I personally disagree. Precisely because there are so many Chinese men who commit adultery, it is appropriate to legislate to punish them. If committing adultery is not regarded as a criminal offense, how can it be sufficient to correct the current licentious trends and maintain family peace? Moreover, at present, men take advantage of their economic superiority to oppress women everywhere, making it impossible for women to achieve economic independence and lacking the skills to earn a living freely. They can only rely on their husbands, lowering their heads and trembling, fearing their husbands' abandonment. Living under male authority, they barely survive and dare not make any demands. If those who commit adultery are regulated within the scope of civil law, then one party of the couple who commits adultery only constitutes grounds for divorce. I ask, after the divorce, who suffers: the husband or the wife? The answer must be that it is of course the wife, because men wield economic superiority and are tolerated by social customs. They can easily remarry after divorce, but women are not. They lack the skills to earn a living and are rejected by society. It is as difficult as ascending to the sky to find a job to support themselves. If they remarry, they are abandoned by old moral evils and customs and are bound by customs. If regulating those who commit adultery within the scope of civil law, it is condoning men committing adultery. This is unthinkable! If one fears that the prisons are not enough to hold married men who commit adultery, one can invoke the principle that laws do not apply retroactively and issue special regulations to handle the matter. All those who committed adultery before the promulgation and implementation of the new criminal law will not be punished, but they must register with the court. If they commit adultery again after registration, they will be punished according to the new criminal law. In this way, it conforms to the principle of equality between men and women and also meets the purpose of promoting proper morals and customs. I submit this to Mr. Wang for his consideration.</p>
<h3>Idle Chat About Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Wu Shi</p>
<p>For the past few months, the cover advertisements of various Shanghai newspapers have been almost entirely taken over by cigarette companies. It is said that the pricing for these advertisements is not small. However, the cigarettes themselves are quite cheap, at sixteen copper coins per pack, seemingly a fixed price agreed upon by all companies in the industry, with no discounts. The gifts offered have made people green with envy. A new car is offered: with a photo of a car being displayed. Fearing that smokers might not appreciate the offer, some say, "Isn't this a dream? Smoking cigarettes and winning something like this? No wonder some people loudly advocate smoking opium." Although the government-sold opium is still being sold, one still has to face legal consequences if caught. Otherwise, people would be saying things like, "Or purchase an ounce or two of Yunesh, and a Western-style house will be yours," as such advertisements have long been openly published.</p>
<p>However, even after advertising for so long, although some cigarette companies have published the names and addresses of the winners, insiders say that some of them are unreliable. The people of Shanghai are the smartest in the nation and shouldn’t fall for this anymore. Yet, these kinds of promotional advertisements are increasing rather than decreasing. Naturally, no matter how bad the market is, selling one and giving ten as a bonus, losing money, is never good business. Giving away a car of course has its own interest factored into it. What’s more is that the car might not have been given away at all! So, are cigarette smokers all fools who would knowingly commit such an act? Who said that? The aviation lottery tickets worth 500,000 yuan are clearly not going to have *my* number. But why do people still flock to buy them? It’s because there are second prizes, third prizes, the last three digits, the last two digits, and even the last one digit, which can already break even or make a profit! Therefore, there is a lot of hope for those who smoke [lottery cigarettes]. Thermoses, towels, teacups – these are all more valuable than the cigarettes themselves, so why not smoke? Even, even a box of large-sized matches – isn't that the most useful and essential item? If you want to smoke a cigarette but don't have a light, asking someone to borrow one requires at least two "Sorry"s! How carefree it is now. Standing at the entrance of a cigarette shop, like those with low aviation lottery ticket numbers, slowly tearing off the outer wrapper with the words "Pay attention to the gift", carefully pushing open the box lid – naturally, the words "a car" seem to flash before one’s eyes (people are the spiritual beings who hope until they die!). And then, upon seeing clearly that it’s just a box of large-sized matches, one nonchalantly throws it on the counter, picks up a box of matches, and can then smoke a cigarette in an orderly fashion, without having to say "Sorry, can I borrow a light?"</p>
<p>This is the sly tactic of the cigarette companies, deceiving people in a way that they don't feel wronged, or even say, "I know they're deceiving me." Although the profit is small, one can sleep soundly.</p>
<p>However, there’s always a ‘but’. Recently, some people have started to turn their attention to these small "large-sized matches." One must know that small amounts accumulate to make large amounts; grains of sand gather to form a tower. The same principle applies to counterfeiters who specialize in one-jiao currency notes. One thousand boxes of matches are worth seven silver dollars!</p>
<p>Making and making, they make a lot. Ten sevens are seventy yuan, a hundred sevens are seven hundred yuan. This gentleman can truly be said to have a way of making money, not knowing that people are investing a lot of money in "new cars"? These lowly things!</p>
<p>Finally, a strong disclaimer: the word "idle chat" has been added to the title "Cigarettes," it’s just idle chat, nothing more. I hope it will not be taken as another case of [Idle Chat XX].</p>
<h3>A Casual Talk on "Heng Yo"</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>When I first came to Shanghai a few years ago, I found everything about Shanghai's mechanical civilization infinitely novel and interesting. The "heng yo" sounds of the coolies on the docks and in the city streets, dressed in rags and carrying heavy loads, also contributed to the novel and interesting scenes in my mind. At that time, I followed a friend from Avenue Dubail along the Bund, over the Garden Bridge, walking to the Shanghai Theater on North Sichuan Road. Several times we had to cross the intersection, and that friend, seeing my unfamiliar and rash way of walking, explained the function of the traffic lights while joking. Aside from the teasing laughter, he also teased me several times for repeatedly stopping to listen attentively to the coolies' "heng yo, heng yo" expressions. As time passed, it could be said that I received a baptism of Shanghai civilization. I realized that such behavior would be laughed at on the streets of Shanghai. However, this Shanghai scene, the "heng yo," really gave me too much interest. Whenever the night was deep and the city was quiet, walking through the quieter streets, I would come across the sounds of "heng yo" hummed by construction workers working through the night, and I would secretly stand aside, listening intently.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when I went to Southeast Asia with my grandmother, I felt infinite interest when passing through the ports of Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, and seeing the expressions of the coolies on the docks singing while working. In Burma, I lived in a small town in the hills, and the house happened to be next to the train station. Every time I heard this simple and sad song, it was as if I were drinking light coffee, and my mind was floating endlessly. At that time, I was still young, and the other impressions are not very clear now. Only the singing of the coolies (most of the coolies in Burma were from Fujian) while working still has a deep impression on me. The year before last, when I passed through Hong Kong and Guangzhou, I also heard this "heng yo" sound. But compared to Shanghai's, it seemed to lack a kind of clear and appropriate rhythm. It just didn’t sound as good as Shanghai’s.</p>
<p>Although everything I wanted to do on this return trip to my hometown has failed and nothing has been achieved, it is still quite worthwhile to have this opportunity to return to my hometown to see the situation. Regarding my hometown, which is gradually becoming a city, I don't seem to have any feelings or praise. What surprised me very much was that in the mouths of the many construction workers, dock porters, and farmers and woodcutters carrying loads on their shoulders, I couldn't hear the "heng yo, heng yo" sounds. Under the labor of straining muscles and bulging veins, they endured the sound, swallowing their breath without a hint of slackness or weakness in their posture and expression. The speed and rhythm of their work were still very tense. Seeing this calm and solemn expression, I felt infinite sadness and greatness. It was completely different from the interesting "heng yo" of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Age and experience have a great relationship with the understanding of life and society. Whether it is Shanghai's, the Fujian people's, or the hometown's, one can see the different qualities of each nation in comparison. It is the same labor, the same burden of a thousand pounds of life, one is "heng yo, heng yo," expressing their submission and pity for life, one is calm and solemn, expressing the tragic and steadfast strength of life. I seem to have heard someone say that the "heng yo" sound emitted by workers while working is a natural instinct, to alleviate and anesthetize the fatigue of the limbs through that singing and drinking. This may be another way of explaining it.</p>
<h3>East, West, North, South</h3>
<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>Nothing is more sorrowful than a dead heart; if the heart is not dead, there is always a way. After the Kneeling Appealing Corps, there is now a Kneeling Requesting Corps.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, a member, Mr. Wang, knelt to beg a vendor selling inferior goods, and finally made him discover his conscience, vowing never to do such business again. He also knelt to beg a modern girl with curled hair, high heels, and dressed in fashionable clothes and imported goods, but was rebuffed, loudly saying: "Wearing foreign goods is my freedom, what business is it of yours!" It was truly imposing. Even after passersby explained, the modern girl realized she was wrong and speechless, and blushing, replied shyly, "I will not wear foreign goods next time." Whether this is a "discovery of conscience," compared to the vendor who resolutely vowed never to do such business again, is ultimately - ultimately - a little like that -</p>
<p>Therefore, on the same day, there was also news of the crowning of the 1935 Shanghai Dance Queen.</p>

<h3>Inharmonious Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Cause Suffering for the Son</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Five years ago, I married an old-fashioned woman chosen for me by my parents. Before the wedding, my parents and my father-in-law had disagreements over the bride price. As a result, after the marriage, my mother always held a contemptuous attitude towards my wife, first mocking her in words, then abusing her in every action.</p>
<p>As for me, I am away from home, far away serving in society. All my earnings are used for household expenses, with no savings. I only return home once or twice a year. And every time I return, my mother always sheds tears, complaining to me in great distress. At that time, I firmly believed that she was telling the truth, so I severely oppressed my wife, urging her to reconcile with my mother. Alas! My poor, weak wife suffered many injustices from me. Later, she (my wife) even attempted suicide once because she could not bear the oppression. Although she was rescued, I was immediately subjected to a major condemnation of conscience, which made me wake up a lot. At that time, with the persuasion of neighbors and relatives, I learned the truth. The above is the major part of my life history for the three years after my marriage.</p>
<p>Later, every time I went home, although my mother still cried to me constantly, I just dealt with both sides superficially. At that time, seeing that I did not treat my wife as fiercely as before, my mother exhausted all methods to make our couple disunited, but she never achieved her goal. In the end, she turned around and attacked me. My history of suffering began from then on.</p>
<p>My father is a sensible person. Seeing that we, a young couple, were not harmonious, he always sincerely tried to mediate. But my mother either quarreled and fussed with him, or used the means of fasting to threaten her. My father was so entangled that he had no way to think, so he had to obey her, initially just superficially for the sake of peace, but later he was assimilated.</p>
<p>After that, whenever I met my parents, they always called me "unfilial son," cursing me lightly and beating me severely. Sometimes they wanted to drive me out, sometimes they imprisoned me, leaving me with no way to go. The persuasion of villagers and relatives always failed to make them realize. In this environment, I always used the word "endure" to maintain the temporary situation, but now, it is really unbearable.</p>
<p>Recently, I have repeatedly asked to bring my wife out, but they are afraid that I will cut off their supply, so they are unwilling to allow it. They are also spreading rumors that I am bringing my wife out with ill intentions, and that they will definitely come out to pester me to death, so that I cannot work in peace outside... and so on.</p>
<p>Sir: You are the light in the darkness, I beg you to show us a way to survive!</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you good health, Yu Renze</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Due to the narrow-mindedness of women, and other special reasons, conflicts often occur between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law due to disagreements. We feel that this phenomenon is very common now, and Yu Jun's family is one of them.</p>
<p>According to the letter: Yu Jun is away from home, serving far away, providing all his salary for the use of the family, but his parents not only do not encourage him, comfort him, but also because of a small grievance due to disagreements with the in-laws, they try their best to abuse their daughter-in-law, trying to make the son and daughter-in-law disunited. It seems too stubborn, too unlike the behavior of parents towards their children.</p>
<p>We believe that Yu Jun does not need to worry too much. If handled properly, this situation will never lead to any unexpected changes. Now, the first step for Yu Jun is to first try to smooth out the feelings of both parties. If parents and wife can understand each other and live very harmoniously, that would of course be the best. Otherwise, you can temporarily send your wife back to her mother's house, or a relative's house to live for a while, to ease the atmosphere of conflict between the two sides. Then observe the future situation before she can return to the family. I think as long as the wife’s family or relatives can understand your difficulties, they may not refuse. If it is difficult to stay with other people, then it depends on whether you have the ability to support two families at the same time. If you have this ability, you can bring your wife to the place where you work and form a small family separately, which is not illegal. As for the parents, as long as you do not cut off their living expenses, I expect they will not "pester you to death."</p>

<h3>Liu Desheng in Jiangxi (6)</h3>
<p>— Wan Guoan</p>
<p>I Forgot What Number the Third Division Was</p>
<p>"Don't play dumb!" The young woman chuckled, rubbing her face against the Black Dude's cheek, intensifying the heat. The Black Dude, like a starving tiger pouncing on its prey, wrapped the young woman in his powerful arms. The combined shadows of the two swayed wildly on the mud wall for a long time. The dim light seemed shy and became even dimmer.</p>
<p>It was as if the Black Dude had been starving for a long time and suddenly had his fill. He lay weakly on the broken wooden bed, panting. A cool breeze blew in through the window, gently caressing the heat on his head.</p>
<p>The young woman also lay weakly in his arms, slowly saying, "You have to remember! Tomorrow there will be a meeting to welcome you... do you remember?"</p>
<p>"There's too much, I can't remember," the Black Dude was only preoccupied with savoring the aftertaste, and didn't even hear. When she asked, the Black Dude blurted out this sentence.</p>
<p>Four The Stage Bottom Was in Revolt</p>
<p>The next day, in an open space outside the small village, several uneven planks were propped up to form a small stage. Many people were standing in front, guys in tattered gray uniforms crowding around in a mess. The young woman was still smiling, holding a small red flag, shouting, laughing, and making noise everywhere.</p>
<p>At this time, the Black Dude seemed like a hero, followed by a group of skinny ghost-like officers. The young woman surrounded him for a while before letting them go on stage. A short guy first stood at the edge of the stage and shouted for a while. The Black Dude vaguely heard a few sentences!</p>
<p>"...Bai...comrade...join the Red Army..."</p>
<p>After the short guy finished shouting, he stepped back and said to him!</p>
<p>"Comrade: You speak!"</p>

<h3>The Reason for Leslie Howard's Pursuit of Secrecy</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Unwilling to talk much outside of work</p>
<p>Private thoughts and actions are most likely to cause misunderstandings</p>
<p>According to Leslie Howard himself, he will hide himself from now on. Regarding all interviews with journalists who come to inquire about his private life, his personality, actions, etc., he will follow in the footsteps of the mysterious actress Greta Garbo and keep everything secret. As for Katharine Hepburn, that's even less of a concern. This matter has been rumored for a long time. Later, it was said that he had made a decision. Many fans who care about Leslie Howard became busy, and everyone wrote letters to ask him questions or give him advice. Strangely, many of these letters actually supported his secrecy. However, it was not until recently, when he set off for England, that a journalist had a brief conversation with him at the pier, confirming the rumors mentioned above. He admitted his plan and said that this conversation might be his last with a journalist. So, what is the purpose he holds, and what are the reasons? Let's investigate.</p>
<p>Leslie Howard said: "Yes. I've been thinking about this for months. Now I've made up my mind. I don't approve of exposing a person's private life for everyone to examine. I don't think that's right. Think about it, isn't that kind of trivial, personal publicity too unreasonable?" Trivial, intentional publicity about personal matters may be inappropriate, but why does Leslie Howard refuse all interviews with journalists? Why doesn't he talk to journalists about things he can tell people and make them slightly public to the public? Leslie Howard said: "That's unnecessary. They will find it out from other sources. They have the ability to say it completely, even more detailed than I can say it myself. As for personal publicity, frankly, many people like it, but I don't." His attitude was firm when he spoke. He continued: "If journalists come to interview me and only ask about my work, whether on the screen or on the stage, I don't mind talking to them, but inevitably, they will soon ask about my various personal thoughts and actions, etc. Furthermore, it seems like I have an obligation to answer all questions, and my answers must also conform to the psychology of the general readership to make them feel satisfied. This is really too great a responsibility for a mature intellectual. Sometimes, if I use sincerity to answer a question and don't use diplomatic means, I risk offending thousands and thousands of people. If I say something critical about Hollywood, if it's unpleasant to hear, people will scold me as a British islander. Of course, I am a British citizen, and I don't mind, but from an artistic point of view, the idea of nationality has never entered my mind, whether on the stage or on the screen. But in the mouths of journalists, nationality seems to be a big deal. For example, I say that I want my children to be educated in my home country. That's entirely my personal matter, of course, and I haven't thought about the divide between England and America at all. But when this sentence is spread out, everyone will clamor and say: "He earned a lot of money in America, but he doesn't approve of American education!" As a matter of fact, the children already have many friends in England. They are already accustomed to English schools, so why should I interrupt their studies and move them to America?"</p>
<p>"So, mentioning a person's private life, personal opinions, etc., easily leads to many misunderstandings. He clearly has sufficient reasons, but he doesn't explain them in detail, or due to the journalist's negligence, they are not explained accurately, which often leads to external criticism. Looking at it this way, it's better not to speak at all. So, from now on, besides my work, I won't mention anything else to people. Unfortunately, not many people like to hear about work, and only fellow actors understand an actor's work. Of course, if you talk about what kind of socks you wear, what kind of cigarettes you smoke, more people will listen."</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>My Review of "Woman's Way"</h3>
<p>— Fei Nianzu</p>
<p>"Woman's Way," which is advertised as an educational film, has finally been released, but after watching this film, I can't help but feel greatly disappointed. I feel that "Woman's Way" is an ordinary work, but in China, where educational films are lacking, and from what we see on the screen, it can be considered a work above the level of the average.</p>
<p>Director Chen Kangran worked very hard in this film, so the entire drama, from beginning to end, achieved a consistent atmosphere. There are also a few clever touches that are not bad. For example, in class, the professor asks, "How is China?" and Baosheng is dozing off, so an answer is given implicitly by Baosheng. Baosheng returns home very late because of the movie, and tells his family that he is busy with schoolwork, but drops the movie theater's brochure. Baosheng pretends to buy books, and his wife, mother, and sister all pawn their clothes, etc., all of which are quite commendable. However, the playwright only focuses on family education and neglects the greater social education. Is not buying candy for children enough to be a model of a good mother?</p>
<p>As for the actors, Xuan Jinglin's old mother can be called experienced. Her performance is consummate and she is a veteran in this field. Xu Qinfang has not made considerable progress, but has maintained her past achievements. Hu Yixing, I hate that my knowledge is shallow, it is my first time seeing her on the screen, she can be developed. This film still has considerable achievements. Zhu Qiuhen has a special contribution, with a slutty style, lively and lovely. Xiao Ying's professor also performs realistically.</p>
<h3>My Review of "Woman's Way"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zigui</p>
<p>First of all, it should be said that "Woman's Way" is a relatively conscious domestic film.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the foundation of a person's good or bad character after growing up is family education. However, the importance of the task of family education is mostly built on the mother, so we are very in need of emerging "virtuous mothers and good wives." Therefore, we have high hopes for "Woman's Way," which is advertised as "children's education." But what kind of impression does "Woman's Way" give me?</p>
<p>The playwright of "Woman's Way," in his thinking, has chosen a great subject. But in terms of his entire principles and concepts, it is too casual and he has roughly pieced it together into a film script. This has to make observers feel regretful.</p>
<p>However, "Woman's Way" also has commendable points: it depicts Baosheng's personality after growing up, poisoned by his mother's doting, resulting in him becoming a degenerate youth with inferior thoughts, not thinking of making progress, and falling into the den of sin. At the same time, he writes that Ruizhi becomes a female office worker because of economic difficulties and wholeheartedly educates her own son, which is the central point of "Woman's Way," and it is hoped that parents in general will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>However, there is no further, more thorough understanding in "Woman's Way." He does not clearly indicate what kind of efforts should be made for rational family education, which can be said to be the most significant shortcoming of "Woman's Way."</p>
<p>As for the director's skills, they are only average. Moreover, in the two scenes of dying, Baosheng happens to come to send them off, and the setting up of the spirit tablet and burning of tin foil after his father's death also contain a strong superstitious concept.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the actors are competent.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Shorts</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's contract with MGM is about to expire, but the company authorities are confident that they will be able to sign a new contract. Garbo is currently filming a new film, "Painted Veil."</p>
<p>Anna Sten's two-year contract with Goldwyn also recently expired, and she immediately signed a new five-year contract. Do you know how many films Anna has made in two years? God only knows, she has only made one film, "Nana!"</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse's owner, Walt Disney, has expanded his original studio to 12,000 square feet because it was too small.</p>
<p>Van Bunk's daughter, Georgette, will make her virgin appearance as an extra in his new film.</p>
<p>Old star Pola Negri is reportedly writing a book entitled: "My Glorious Autobiography."</p>
<p>Kathleen Frances recently suffered serious injuries to both wrists in a car crash. If it hadn't been for the maid on the scene quickly bandaging her up, she would have undoubtedly been "disfigured."</p>
<p>Carole Lombard has been hospitalized recently due to a severe cold.</p>
<p>Frances Dee will have "good news" in the near future. If she has a boy, she will buy $10,000 worth of stock.</p>
<h3>Tang Na's Dispatch Reports on the "Escape" Work Situation</h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>Regarding the news of the Art China Film Company's new film "Escape," set against the backdrop of the Northeast and depicting the plight of refugees, directed in a rough style by Yue Feng, assisted by Tang Na, and starring Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Ye Juanjuan, etc., going north to Zhangjiakou to film scenery, this newspaper has previously reported. Now, we have also obtained a letter from Tang Na, which describes the work situation in great detail, and we are reproducing it here:</p>
<p>(The above is omitted) Filming started on the 3rd without interruption, and will probably be completed in Zhangjiakou in four or five days. The weather in Zhangyuan is sometimes cold and sometimes hot. When it's hot, it's hotter than Shanghai, and when it's cold, the cold wind blows in your face and the dust and sand fly, which is very bitter!</p>
<p>This time, about four or five hundred extras were hired in Zhangyuan. There are many camels, ox carts, and mule carts, as well as flocks of sheep and horses. The scene is very grand and the work is progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>On the 3rd, several scenes, such as the town guard and going to the temple fair, were filmed outside the Zhangyuan Dajingmen. When filming, the Public Security Bureau sent many police officers to protect our work.</p>
<p>The next day was at Cishan, and on the third and fourth days, we also filmed messengers, sheep, camel herds, and refugees fleeing at Cishan. The results were extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>On the 7th, when filming the ending of "Escape," we specially borrowed a regiment of local garrison troops (one thousand and several hundred people). Because the scene was grand, three cameras were used to film simultaneously, which was extremely smooth and satisfactory.</p>
<p>When leaving Zhangbei and advancing not far, enemy planes were discovered, and enemy traces were also found in the Guyuan area. We are very cautious and should not have any accidents. (The following is omitted) (Actually)</p>
<h3>Many Prostitutes in "Boat Girl"</h3>
<p>— Fire</p>
<p>Shen Xiling's directed "Boat Girl," the theme is to stand on the humanitarian standpoint, to make a painful cry for those unfortunate women who are suppressed under the male might and are harmed and humiliated. The other day, the scene was filmed in a narrow alley, where the prostitutes, waiting for customers to buy their bodies, wore red and green clothes, and walked two by two on the sidewalk, their thin, yellow faces showing unnatural bitter smiles. Occasionally, a worker in short clothes or shop assistants in jackets passed by, and like flies swarming, everyone rushed up, forcibly pulling them and pleading bitterly: "Sir, thank you, come to my place and sit for a while." But among the group, one happened to encounter a barbaric worker, who became angry when pulled, waved his fist, and beat the prostitutes until they lay on the ground, screaming in pain. In an instant, this place turned into a hell that was unbearable to witness. (Actually)</p>
<h3>Tianyi Special Report</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>For the shoe store scene in "Beauty's Favor," thousands of pairs of shoes have been specially borrowed from major shoe stores today for use.</p>
<p>After Wu Yinhan left, Qiang Ronghua is in charge of photography and other affairs.</p>
<p>Cameraman Xu Zixian is scheduled to marry Ms. Chen Chunying in Hangzhou on the 19th of this month.</p>
<p>Guan Hongda won the men's Group A discus championship again at the Shanghai United Sports Meeting yesterday (the 11th).</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng, Wen Yimin, Liu Ke, Wang Zhongxi, and others all went to Jiaotong University yesterday to visit the sports meeting and cheer for Guan Fatty.</p>
<p>"Hundred Flower Island" will be released soon. (Actually)</p>
<h3>Hundred Words Collection</h3>
<p>— Lin Qin</p>
<p>Movie publications have become a tool, what kind of tool? It is that some people are using movie publications to vent personal desires, to scold people, to expose other people's private morals, and matters unrelated to movies; may I ask, what is the value of such movie publications?</p>
<p>Everything about female employees attracts the most attention from movie fans. Many unrelated literati use this point to fabricate strange news out of nothing, such as who is the lover of a certain female star, which female star is getting married, which female star is getting divorced, what… even the issue of the size of the female star's belly is repeatedly brought up for discussion; their purpose is only to attract the attention of movie fans, but this kind of work is of no benefit to the film itself.</p>
<p>"Self-written and directed" is the most popular in the Chinese film industry. Every screenwriter becomes a director, every screenwriter wants to "self-write and direct"; every director also wants to be a screenwriter, and every director wants to "self-write and direct"; really, I don't believe that a person who can write a screenplay can direct, and a person who can direct can write a screenplay! Screenwriting and directing are clearly two different jobs. Chinese people are really smart, otherwise how could so many "self-written and directed" "omnipotent doctors" be produced?</p>
<p>Amidst the ban on university students entering dance halls, every Chinese film (a large part) has dance hall scenes interspersed, which shows that dance halls have become extremely common in China…</p>

<h3>Too Late to Meet (The Age of Innocence) (3)</h3>
<p>— Li Xin</p>
<p>Newland watched Ellen rush upstairs and didn't dare to follow, so he had to wait downstairs, hoping she would come back, but after waiting for a long time, she still didn't come down. The whole house was so silent, only the sound of the fire in the fireplace, occasionally falling, could be faintly heard. Newland slowly put on his coat, put on his hat, opened the door himself, and walked into the late night. He seemed to have been struck by a strange magic. He had kissed Ellen Minggu, and his whole life had undergone a special change. At this time, the Welland family had all gone to Florida in the south to spend the winter. May would also be leaving New York for the South soon. But Newland hoped she wouldn't go, because as long as she was in New York, their engagement, their future wedding, their small but very solid social circle all seemed real. But if she left New York, all this would be like a house made of cards, falling down. He knew that the foundation of their relationship had reached a precarious state, and after it collapsed in the future, his love for Ellen would be like a building built layer upon layer to cover everything. The shadow of that building would envelop the lives of everyone he loved. Therefore, he tried to persuade May not to go to Florida. But May smiled and said: "But my parents are all there, I can't not go. You are such a cute fool - why are you so anxious?" At the same time, Ellen was also deeply afraid of May going to Florida. If she went, there would be no one to stop Newland from coming to her house. There would be fewer social engagements, and no one would ask about his affairs. "Oh, God! Why did I come back to America?" she condemned herself.</p>
<p>As a result, May Welland still went. Ellen and Newland no longer pretended. They met every day. The daytime passed in a hurry, and everyone was flustered and preoccupied with their own affairs, hoping for the arrival of night, so that they could be together. Relatives wondered and discussed: "Why are Ellen and Newland always together?" Mrs. Minggu, upon hearing this, would definitely say: "That's necessary. Newland is handling her case, and her case is very complicated. Let them do what they want!" One day Newland came again. Ellen opened the door for him and took a bunch of roses from his hand. She said softly: "You always send me flowers, so my house is constantly fragrant." As she spoke, her eyes revealed a hint of resentment. Newland said softly: "I want to be like this, my baby. I want to be like this forever and ever." Ellen suddenly put down the flowers and shouted: "Oh, Newland, how can we go on like this forever? I have done so many things in my life, letting people gossip, but I have never done this kind of sneaky thing! I have never deceived anyone! What is this? You should think about May. You should also think about your mother - think about everyone." Newland said: "I have thought about it all, Ellen. All I know is that without you, I cannot live. On your side, your divorce must be settled. On my side - I will tell them - I will talk to May - " Ellen said: "Oh, that can't be done. Don't you think this is harmful to your future? And your family doesn't approve of this, and it will inevitably lead to a break with you. This sacrifice is too great." Newland said: "For you, no sacrifice can be said to be too great - my future, my family, everything, everything is nothing." Ellen said: "Newland, you have to think clearly, you can't mess around. I think, you should go to Florida first. Go and see May. We'll talk again when you come back." Newland listened to Ellen's words and really ran to Florida, wanting to explain this matter to May with satisfaction. But when he saw May's face, his heart turned cold. How could he bear to make her sad and shed tears - she was so young, without any schemes, and wholeheartedly believed in him. (To be continued)</p>
