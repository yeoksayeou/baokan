<h3 id="c4">所望於中央農村服務講習所者 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>季</p>
<p>日前國府行政院舉行一八五次常會。曾有設立中央農村服務講習所之决議。預定首期招生二三百人。資格限於大學畢業。錄取後入校聽講半年。然後分發各實騐縣實習一年。以爲推進農村敎育之一助。講習所内容之崖略如此。至其詳細計劃及槪算。則提經中央政治會議通過後。始得成立。　　我國以農立國。全國生産大部出於農村。雖謂農業爲國家命脈所繫。亦無不當。故今日欲言興邦利國。首要之圖。厥爲改進農業。增加生産。而後國計民生。乃有充裕可能。我國農民墨守千年成法。耕種技術之簡陋。農産物質量雙方之退化。皆不能與諸農業先進國家爭雄長。此觀於農産品入口額之年有激增。卽可明瞭。國家財源之枯絶。人民生計之困頓。大半穩因於此。國人倡言墾荒殖邊者。實繁有徒。而能實行救濟開闢成熟之農村者。則未之多覩。以至一般農民不能守其田園。籌鄉他適。棄地不耕。形成全國農業江河日下之現象。夫救濟農村之道雖不一端。而提高農民知識。推行新式種植方法。要在必行。近三十年來。一般從事於新敎育者。未嘗不知農業敎育之重要。而能躬親提倡者實寡。據敎育部之統計。十九年度全國中等職業學校學生。僅占百分之六·七强。而習農學生又不過據其中之一小部分。至於二十年度之專校以上學生。習農林者。惟當總數百分之三　二。在各科中之人數爲最少。但就此等片段之統計而論。卽可想見全國具有科學的農事學識之人。實寥若晨星。在一以農立國之國家。農業敎育不發達若是。整個國家之經濟前途。寗復有幸。是以今後農業敎育之亟須推廣。實爲天經地義。此次行政院倡議設立中央農村服務講習所。動機在此。可無疑也。該所之設辦。雖尙有待。但爲期當不在遠。吾人不惟樂觀厥成。且願其實事求事。早著成效。在短期間内。卽蔚爲推進全國實騐縣中農村敎育之大本營焉。</p>
<p>吾人所謂實事求事者何。我國向有之少數農事人才。往往用非所學。學成之後。足不入壟畝。手不親菽麥。日惟與士大夫階級相往還。其能深入農村。改變風氣。從事於種植耕耘。以爲農民之表率者。殊不多見。彼等所受敎育。雖注重於生産。而自身不參加生産。結果對於生産界之影響。安得不微今政府對於中央農村服務講習所之期望。旣甚殷切。當不至僅僅爲少數大學畢業生謀出路。或爲更少數之執敎人員謀一噉飯地。可以想見。吾人所馨香禱祝講習所之成立。卽在於造就深入鄉間之技術人才。而絶不使其員生雙方傳染士大夫階級之惡習。則裨益於各實騐縣之農村敎育者。當非淺鮮也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）　今晨内閣閣議曾考慮海軍談話之嚴重地位、英外相西門卽將與日大使松平再作一度之晤談、以期查明有無可　和日本與英美態度之方法、同時今午巳商定英美雙方代表擇期舉行全體會議、其日期大約爲十一月二十三日、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>衆料羅斯福總統覆英政府之文、將僅涉及英美兩國合作以期成立新約一事、英美大約將於數月内集議、以安置明夏海軍會議之基礎、屆時將請法意兩國參加、明年會議定將討論多方條約、以代現有之華盛頓公約、（廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　首相麥唐納今日在下院宣稱、昨晨渠希望能以海軍談話現勢報告下院、但在前二十四小時内巳發生一種新趨勢、渠意暫時宜勿談及、俾至全事完成後、議院得聞其詳云、下院現從事辯論答覆英皇之訓詞、約五日可畢、然後外相西門將在院發表海軍談話進行情形、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據美海軍代表團中人之意見、海軍談話今未了之事、唯餘握手道别而已、聞日美代表團約將於一週或兩週内離倫敦、今日美代表團聲稱、美國不欲討論華盛頓公約中不設防禦工程之條文、蓋此項條文須原約存在、始有價值云、於是海軍談話妥恊之最後希望亦爲打銷、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　海會談話之形勢、或將間接引起遠東一切問題、蓋日本代表不斷聲明、卽使宣告廢止華盛頓海約、然一九二二年所定太平洋内防禦工事、及海軍根據地保持現狀一層、仍可維持、並應予以維持、日本代表並一再聲明太平洋内委任日本統治各島、不獨未嘗設防、且大半皆不能設置防禦工程云、倫敦中國人士對於此層、採取保留及憂慮態度、渠等深恐日本暗用手段、並謂太平洋各島軍事設備、各方屢屢言之、然日本並未以可靠之理由、予以更生、中國人士又以爲華盛頓海約、凱洛克非戰條約·國聯盟約各條欵·以及華府九國條約之全部、往往被視爲廢紙、殊堪浩嘆、至於美國人士則謂太平洋委任統治各島之不能設置防禦工程、乃由委任契約規定者、無待於討論、海軍談話現仍應就技術上繼續行之云云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美日均勢說</p>
<p>日本似確有此表示</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日本外務省雖否認日本新提案之說、然英國代表部於第四次日英會談、謂日本曾主張「英國保有廣大之海外領土、故能承認其保有高度之海軍、至與美國則有保有同等海軍之必要」云云、然英國自一九二二年以來、原則上承認英美海軍之對等比率、若又贊成上述日本之提案、則前後矛盾、將陷於左右爲難之苦境、（二十日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　十一月十九日報紙載有英外相西門關於倫敦海軍談話之言論、據稱、英外相對新聞記者稱、日本巳抱一種態度、以爲英國應造艦達於高度、並以爲日政府未見有美國海軍應優於日本海軍之理由、英外相又謂日代表巳明白表示日本如得海軍平等權、亦不欲造艦達於與英美平等之程度、但爲體面起見、日本絶不能再接受五五三之比率云、今晨外務省發言人對外國新聞記者聲稱、渠不信英外相曾發此種言論、因各國代表團有一種諒解、談話内容須絶守秘密也云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日本代表部之岩下大佐見英國當局發表見解、謂日本之軍縮對案、係意義美日均等英國優勢、換言之、卽實勢力五四四之主張、致若起騷然之反響、故於二十日對外人記者團發表聲明如下、提出英國能保有大於日本海軍之案、余未曾聞松平山本兩全權有此言、况豫備會議尙在最初階段、斷不能爲數字的提案、此說必係何等之誤解云、（二十一日電通）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　關於豫備交涉之進步、此間發生種種謠傳、莫衷壹是、據謂松平代表對於英美日之海軍力提出五·四·四比率、又謂提出以十五年爲期限、實現年賦均等案、並盛傳日本對美主張均勢、對英則承認日本之劣勢、是以日本代表團及英國政府與夫美國代表團均忙於答覆新聞記者團之質問、頗感煩瑣云、（二十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>希望海會有所成就</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　基督敎科學報今日載有前日首相齋藤一文、抨擊日本及他國之侵略主義、謂日本决不有侵略政策、吾人必須共同生存於世界、苟有一嗜戰國、徒增重各國之担負、渠敢謂倫敦海軍會議必須成功、以謀世界之和平、凡思想正當之人、應知破産的海軍競爭、必不能有所成就、此種趨勢、適使文化退步、而養成仇恨氣燄云、美政府中人對於此文、頗爲注意、但未有發表批評者、同時據倫敦每日電聞消息、美方巳通知日方海軍代表、告以美政府認華盛頓公約第十九條爲此約之主要部份、如此約不復有效、則關於某地點不置防禦工程之條文、當然亦屬無效云、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>波士登　基督敎科學報載日本前首相齋藤之談話、抨擊政友會鼓動日本反對延長海軍條約、齋藤稱、政友會以岡田首相組閣、拒絶多數黨之操縱、遂惱羞成怒、轉而贊助日本軍閥、齋藤深以英美日發生海軍競爭爲慮、並信日皇終能制服軍人、並謂彼深知日皇不欲日本之海軍長此不受約束、如未得首相及内閣之同意、日皇亦不欲核准擴大海軍及增稅之新計劃、（二十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日本前首相齋藤上將、在基督敎科學週刊發表文字、攻擊日本及他國狂妄愛國之徒、主張各海軍國應成立協定、限制軍艦隻數、齋藤上將此文、無異對於其本國人士之鄭重警告、在倫敦方面引起最熱烈最愉快的印象、蓋以齋藤爲日本政界耆宿、歷任最要職務有年、此項言論、勢必引起重大之震驚、此層日本方面人士亦並未諱言、至於英美人士雖具良好印象、然仍採取保留態度、負責人士宣稱、齋藤所作言論、倘由他人負責爲之、實等於自殺、但齋藤於最初任朝鮮總督、其後任日本首相、其温和淸明與勇敢之態度、久巳著聞於世、故聆此言、亦不以爲怪也、日本軍部人物現方據要津、齋藤此種主張、斷無勝利之望、然如此明哲之言論、日本負責政治家若竟毫無所動於中、則亦斷不可能、不寗唯是、就吾人所知、齋藤之言論實與日皇幕府中若干人物之感想相吻合、因此齋藤雖未直接參預目前進行中之海軍談判、然其言論對於海軍談話、將有重要影響、或發生一種新意義、則屬可能也、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英外相西門</p>

<p>（倫敦）　西門外相在十九日之會話席上、對日松平代表提議討論政治問題案、並要求日本與英採取同一步驟、實行遠東政策、對華政策、英國此項提議之用意、似在更新九國及四國條約、確保中國領土之安全、及太平洋之和平、松平代表對此答謂、政治問題之討論、恐使會談糾紛、日本頗難接收此項提議、（二十日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　西門外相十九日對日代表提出之確保太平洋和平之提案内容如次、</p>

<p>吾人求世界海軍非用於進攻、故主張戰鬥艦航空母艦與甲級巡洋艦之縮廢、及巡洋艦驅逐艦與潛水艦等之有限度、且吾人務减小全艦隊之保有量、共同决定其最高限度、其時若介入政治問題、則徒令會議複雜、於事無補、若會議决裂、願極力避免發生建艦競爭、然若陷於無條件狀態而發生如斯競爭、則吾人不甘落後也云、（二十一日電通電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　下院今日辯論英皇之訓詞、首相麥店納稱、國外之政治情形非常危急、巳無待贅言、故英國必須繼續竭力維持世界和平、麥氏云、「吾國現在當前最重要之問題、卽爲對外關係、巳往十八閱月中之情形、世界各國之信心迄未增加、故吾人主張仍在日内瓦進行合作、不但表示吾人爲遵守和平主義之政府、蓋亦可爲吾國促進最大之利益也」云云、（二十日國民電）</p>

<p>蘇俄再宣布</p>
<p>中東路交涉擱淺眞相</p>
<p>日認保證付欵爲侮辱</p>
<p>復反對將爭執付仲裁</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　關於中東路出售談判之眞相雖有十月三十一日塔斯社之詳細報告、唯目下日滿報紙對交涉進行仍作不確實之報導、同時國際方面僉以售價問題旣巳解决、其他出賣條件果何爲而能延宕最後恊定之簽訂爲異、故塔斯社復從可靠方面收集關於談判眞相之其他消息、以明此項延宕之眞因、</p>
<p>關於中東路若干出售條件、日方對於蘇聯某些當然之要求、頗爲堅持、不願應允、如於蘇方所撥付欵保障之合理要求、最爲明顯、此項辦法乃欲抹取由日方保障「滿國」債務之形式、所不幸者、日本自塔斯社於十月三十一日發表詳報以後、對於此項重要問題並未改變其態度、蘇聯方面以此乃純粹商業性質、而在日本則提出「信任」「滿洲國」之原則、並允於「滿國」付欵發生困難時任「調停」之責、不僅如是、日方（日滿報界爲尤甚）且以蘇聯之要求爲「不信任」日滿、且幾爲侮辱日滿之表現、此點令莫斯科大爲驚詫、彼等以爲於訂立此類商務之際、援用保障制度實爲舉世所公證、至於目下事件、此項巨大經濟企業乃以分期擄欵方法出賣、同時該路主權於恊定簽訂時起卽移歸新主、如此塲合、則合於慣例之要求保障、實屬當然、至於「不信任」問題尤屬不倫、蓋蘇聯方面如於日本保障之效力並不信任、或於日本爲其自身利益計、對於由日方保證之債務决不令其不如數履行一點、並不肯定者、則决不要求日本出爲保障矣、蘇聯所以如此者、正以其假定日本之保障必能令恊定能照常履行耳、</p>
<p>同時、爲鞏固蘇聯與日本之正常關係計、應預令以後於履行出售恊定時所生爭端不爲兩國新糾紛之根源、蘇聯方面爲願達到此點、故要求設置仲裁、以便解决此後關於繳貨或路欵計算上所能發生之歧異、同時公正仲裁人員如無法推定、則蘇聯建議此項仲裁人員得由具有國際聲望之外國商會（如英美等國之商會）委任之、此項商會名稱應於恊定内註明、</p>
<p>此項問題至爲重要、因蘇聯允許日滿方面用貨物償付路價三分之二、同時爲滿足日方之願望計、蘇聯復允將該項貨物之種類擴充、卽除工業機器外、包括紡織品·絲·茶·大豆·米及其他貨品、唯日本方面對於外國公斷員之加入仲裁表示反對、彼等建議請日本外務省或商務省外表一人爲此項公斷員、此項建議自遭拒絶、因日本於將來蘇滿發生爭執時、自不能以絶無干係之「第三者」自居也、且日本正在應用此項仲裁原則解决其與他國經濟性質之爭端、例如彼爲國際商務仲裁恊定之簽約國、故日方拒絶接受用以解决蘇滿間可有的糾紛之仲裁辦法、益令人不解、日方於上開問題中所表示之堅執態度、其所以引起莫斯科之注意者、復因蘇聯政府於優列湼夫於十月三十日·三十一日及十一月六日所致廣田之說帖中、對於其他爭點、復大有讓步矣、吾人於此固不能對於各項重要問題一一指明、唯於此須一言道及者、卽日方曾一再將原經同意之點、根本取消、如是則交涉進行自感困難矣、如於七月二十三日雙方同意交涉一經成立、須立卽撥付中東路路員之退職金及扶養費、唯最近日人竟突然宣告、前此對於此點並無何種恊定、此間當局對於下述事實最爲注意、卽蘇日兩方於談判進行時關於各自願望之内容、其所持態度逈不相同、在蘇聯方面、向循下述目標進行、卽中東路出售恊定、一方固欲永久消除利用中東路問題以令蘇日邦交趨於緊張之可能、同時復須包含促其本身順利實現之保障、由是而令兩國政治與經濟關係之鞏固有所增進、而有裨於世界之和平、日本方面一部份之建議則反是、此等建議如經採入恊定則雖於中東路出賣之後、人將復能利用中東路問題爲日蘇衝突之根源云、此項恊定原爲一種和平工具、而一部份日人能將其變成未來衝突之武器、故蘇聯消息靈通方面以爲願令此項協定具有上述性質之希冀、實與上述一部份日人之利害相符合、夫如是則此項恊定將與蘇日敦睦邦交一點顯相衝突、故其與一般和平亦將如水火矣、故蘇聯方面甚願日本政府能證實其所懷善意、令此項交涉得滿意完成、蓋此亦未始非日人之福云、（二十一日塔斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）　第二次豫算閣議巳於二十一日午後一時四十分召集於首相官邸、首由藤井藏相關於大藏省對於各省追加要求審定之槪要、謂其總數巳達三億二千萬圓、而發行公債自有限度、非但不得不考慮市塲之消化力、且須根據漸减赤字公債之方針、而加以審定、共總額不得超過四千一百萬元、各省對此或均表示不滿、但此間惟有請求體諒財政當局之苦心、忍其不可不忍之處、是所至盼云云、此次對於審定追加要最抱不滿者輒爲軍部、尤以林陸相聲稱滿洲事件尙未平常化、值此一九三五—六年之國際重大時期、在軍政方面當以謀國防整備爲其必要、縱使體諒大藏當局之苦衷、而此次之審定則萬難承認、務望再行考慮云、陸相以極其强硬之態度主張追加要求不得稍有削减、於是閣議頓形緊張、其次則由大角海相發言、謂現在倫敦之軍縮豫備會商尙在進行中、在海軍方面認爲處於極關重要之時期、故此次大藏省審定案决不能承認云、陸海軍兩大臣均未觸及數字、是以時局認識爲其出發點、而表示最初之追加要求未便讓步之態度、此時藤井藏相復將財政現狀加以說明、並反復聲明前述之言論、希望軍部退讓、其次則由後藤内相關於時局匡救費及災害對策豫算要求追加、松田文相則謂、小學校缺食、兒童之食費勢非要求不可、山崎農相關於農村救濟及復興農村等等費用亦須要追加、似此各具實情皆有必要而逼及藏相、乃由藏相再將各項審定理由詳述、然後由床次遞相關於發行公債質問是否擁有若干緩和餘地、藏相謂、少刻當對於增稅案陳述意見、復將根據調查資料發行公債之限度加以解釋、至此閣議暫時休息、時巳午後六時、晚餐後、復於午後七時起繼續開議矣、（二十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>贛省</p>
<p>農村副業槪况</p>
<p>愛經濟影響産銷均視前减少</p>
<p>南昌通信、江西爲長江流域之重要農産區、農民除以米穀爲主要出産外、他如棉花·苧蔴·茶·菸葉·靛靑·蔗糖·植物油·夏布·竹木·及製紙等、亦均極發達、惟近年以來、外受各國經濟影響、内遭赤匪蹂躪、各業均巳一落千丈、不絶如縷、全國經濟委員會駐贛辦事處、爲救濟本省農村副業及手工業、以圖復興農村起見、特委託經委會顧問戴樂仁、組織調查隊、赴各地實際考察、其所考察之範圍、及本省各農村副業槪况如下、</p>
<p>棉花　本省八十三縣、無不植棉、其出産較多者爲贛北之永修·都昌·九江·湖口·彭澤·鄱陽·等縣、尤以南潯路沿線永修、爲棉産代表區、九江因係長江要口、目有大規模之久興紗廠、故爲棉之集中地、民國二十二年省經委會估計、本省皮棉總産量約八萬八千擔以上、每擔約四十元上下、合共值三百五十萬元、</p>
<p>榨油　本省各鄉間除棉子榨油外、如蕓苔茶于花生蔴子油産量亦多、每擔棉子可榨油十二三斤、蕓苔四十斤、茶子十九斤至二十四斤不等、在昔出口額頗鉅、今則反有外油輸入、</p>
<p>苧蔴　本省八十一縣、産苧蔴過半數、最著者爲夏布出産名地萬載、及其附近各縣、據民國十七年海關貿易統計報告、輸出苧蔴達十七萬二千擔以上、同年由此製成之夏布輸出達二萬擔以上、值銀二百八十餘萬海關兩、又據民二十二年省經委會報告、苧蔴産量四十至三百斤不等、每擔值十至二十元之間、近年因夏布銷路日蹙、産量亦日就衰微矣、</p>
<p>夏布　夏布之主要出産地爲萬載·宜黄·寗都·上高·宜春·萍鄉·分宜·臨川·崇仁·玉山等縣、分組細兩種、幅寬一尺二至一尺六、長爲五丈、細者每個重一斤數兩、粗者重一斤十數兩、自折蔴績縷以至織布、均用女工、男工甚少、民國十九年以前、輸出甚盛、十九年海關輸出值銀四百三十餘萬兩、自十九年以後、遞次比較、有减無加、差數至爲驚人、衰落原因雖多、而製造不良、成本過大、受竹布麻紗排擠、實其主因、</p>
<p>竹紙　本省爲國内重要紙産地、産紙者達四十縣、前江西紙稅局頒布稅則紙類達二百種之多、其分布區域、竹料所製之表芯紙首推萬載宜春連史關山等、白潤之文具紙則爲鉛山所出毛邊紙則製自南城崇仁石城永豐吉安遂川、泰和河口大庾等驟、内以吉安橫江渡産者爲最佳、竹紙製法、完全爲舊式手工業、不知改良、自受洋紙影響、每年出口由數百萬减至數十萬元、又稻草製紙、以宜黄安福鉛山等縣爲最多、常作包裹之用、近受牛皮紙影響、除窮鄉僻壤外、多不採用矣、</p>
<p>茶葉　本省各縣莫不産茶、有輸出者達五十餘縣、就中以修水鉅皷武寗浮梁德興玉山上饒鉛山婺源等縣爲較著、而舊府洽寗州轄之修水銅皷及武寗等縣、所出紅茶、昔在國際市塲頗爲著名、尤以俄國及南洋銷路最廣、近爲錫印等茶所奪、一落千丈、綠茶産量不及紅茶三分之一、行銷内地及國内、近因匪禍、亦漸减少、實業部在修水設茶業改良塲、本省農業院亦將設茶業示範塲、以資改良、</p>
<p>菸葉　本省約有二十餘縣産烟、最多者爲廣豐信豐鄱陽、次多者爲彭澤石城安遠宜黄瑞金大廋廣昌黎川等縣、因種植不得法、僅廣昌廣豐及饒州等處少數能製雪茄及捲烟、餘均只能製黄絲烟、故銷路日窄、以視紙烟之一日千里、只有退避三舍耳、</p>
<p>蔗糖　本省東鄉臨川豐城南昌餘江萬年樂平上饒廣豐玉山南康大廋等縣、皆産甘蔗、以蔗製糖者有東鄉臨川南康夫瘦等縣、除南康所製多較白者外、其餘大都爲紅糖及砂糖、糖之銷路、盡爲荷蘭太古所佔、土糖只供少數農民之食用、</p>
<p>靛靑　本省靛靑爲蓼藍及苜蓼所製、樂平鄱陽萬年臨川德安各縣均有出産、以樂平所産最佳、蓼藍每擔十元、苜藍八元、民六本省靛靑出口八萬三千一百九十五擔、最近一年僅六十三擔、衰落巳極、而洋靛進口、則蒸蒸日上、</p>
<p>贛閩</p>
<p>殘匪卽可肅淸</p>

<p>日輪奉天丸中</p>
<p>旅客投海自殺</p>
<p>突然投海竟無人知</p>
<p>靑年妻子凄然返港</p>
<p>日商大連汽船會社之奉天丸、此次自大連靑島來滬、船内旅客發生投海自殺慘劇、茲將所得消息、分述如下、</p>
<p>來客擁擠　此次奉天丸自大連開出時、從東北各處至大連乘船南下之搭客甚夥、僅統艙一部、有一百多名、該輪於十六日離大連總計到上海搭客共有一百四十九人、其中多數爲到滬之國人、而以商界分子占大多數、統艙旅客内有季憲榮者、携帶妻子、亦從大連達到上海、而後轉往香港者、</p>
<p>投海自殺　統艙客季憲榮、係廣東籍、年二十五歲、在大連乘船時報稱在香港經營銀器業、此次因商業上關係、前往東北、妻子名袁素英、年祗十七歲、同季均乘統艙到上海者、携帶行李等物、此船十七日到靑島時、季憲榮尙未投海自殺、及至十八日奉天丸離靑開出來滬、季乃乘人不備、躍入海内自盡、卽妻子亦未得知也、</p>
<p>屍體未獲　死者投海之際、似在十八日之後、乘妻子睡熟之際、潛至奉天丸輪之船後尾甲板上、躍入海内自殺、當時竟無人知及經其妻子發覺乃夫失踪、卽報告船主、四處查詢、殊無影踪、船上後艙尾發見季之投海痕跡、蓋有衣物遺留於此處也、其投海地點巳經不知、故屍體亦無撈救、</p>
<p>妻返香港　此事發生後、經船主等詢問其妻袁素英、始知季之自殺、出於意外、並無神經病、蓋似爲商業失敗所致、其妻巳乘輪來滬、季在香港設有銀樓店、現乃妻携帶行李物件、祇得轉乘他輪、凄然返港、</p>

<h3 id="c24">追念史量才先生 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>說起國貨，不能不追念史量才先生，在「九一八」「一二八」以後，國人疾首蹙額，痛心切齒，欲求所以報仇雪恥的，可說在國民中佔着大多數。可是空言報仇雪恥，當然没有用處。那時史先生，便在地方協會中會同了諸位先生集議，爲喚起國人注意服用國貨起見，特定民國二十二年爲國貨年，並於申報特闢國貨週刊，爲之倡導宣傳，特囑編者與杜君重遠主持編輯。史先生每次晤見，殷殷詢及，奬勉備至。去年之杪，復在地方恊會集議，以服用國貨，婦女的責任較巨，因公定今年爲婦女國貨年，並囑編者對於實際有功於匣貨事業，與經過艱難奮鬥的工業界成功人，應該隨時訪問，特别表揚，使國貨工業有進步的希望。今年旣定爲婦女國貨年，史先生又囑分訪婦女界領袖與熱心女士對於國貨的意見，以供國貨界的參考。編者爲國貨公司國貨工廠事業，有所請求於史先生的，史先生没有不竭誠贊助，玉其成功。猶記先生赴杭的前幾天，編者應先生之招，赴本館談話，史先生即言提倡國貨，應從國貨年本身着想，究竟國貨界的困難何在？國貨二業的阻力怎樣？應去的缺點多少？應該效法的優點多少？所以不能和外貨競爭的原因何在？都該實地訪問，和盤托出，纔得國人起來想法的機會。因於本報添刊國貨工業特别調查錄，以供關心國貨事業者的研究。這樣有熱忱，有毅力，有眼光，有見解，爲國貨界奮鬥宣勞，值得令人追記，令人懷念。史先生雖死，史先生的精神不死，史先生的主義不死，史先生熱心提倡國貨的懷抱，我們後死的都要繼續地發揚光大，以慰史先生在天之靈。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c25">大家來建設一個愛用國貨的心理 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 魏泰順</p>
<p>提倡國貨的聲浪，現在差不多個個人都聽到了：翻開報紙來，也天天有宣傳國貨的文字；國貨機關，也整日在想勸用國貨的辦法；社會上熱心國貨的太太小姐們，也隨時唇焦舌敝地作種種國貨宣傳：然而，事實擺在面前，半年來本國的金錢，仍舊在涓涓不息的向外流去，這是什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>我們要一心救國，要一心杜絶漏巵，需先瞧瞧别國是如何亡，從前亡人家國的，不是用政治，便是用軍事，現在却不盡然，最近亡人家國的武器，乃是制人死命的經濟；經濟眞是殺人不見血的鎗砲毒瓦斯，我們看了一個東印度公司，可以結果了偌大的印度國，由此推想，我們實在不怕鎗砲毒瓦斯，我們不怕精幹的軍隊，實在我們要怕那巧艶美色的外國貨，來榨取我們可愛的民財民血呢！</p>
<p>要求金錢不外溢，當然要中國人愛用中國貨，拼絶外國貨，金錢旣是不流出，國家的經濟自然很富裕，但是說也奇怪，我們明知服用外國貨是足以亡人家國的，爲什麽國際貿易局的報告，終究入超增加，爲什麽國人的喫着用，還是外國貨居多，我想一定還有整千整萬國人，懷着下列的八種心理：</p>
<p>（一）用外國貨是漂亮的，並且可以表示出我的富貴，時髦，摩登，寫意。</p>
<p>（二）我一個人服用外國貨，與國家經濟有什麽關係，更談不到國家的存亡。</p>
<p>（三）外貨巳有國貨的替代品，偏說是出於萬不得巳而購用的。</p>
<p>（四）新近向外國商店買的外國貨，被人發覺，却聲明是從前買來的。</p>
<p>（五）别人都在用外國貨，我不妨也來摹倣一下。</p>
<p>（六）用國貨惟恐失了身價的人，碰到有集會的時候，不得巳穿上一套國貨衫褲，來遮飾遮飾。</p>
<p>（七）外國貨價值比中國貨便宜，質料又好，我何苦去購買價貴質劣的中國貨。</p>
<p>（八）我未能辨别中國貨與外國貨，祇要脗合我的物質慾，都是好的。</p>
<p>國人有了以上的八種心理，國貨那有出路的希望，國家經濟，那有富裕的一天，我們應該從今天起，凡是有愛國心的，都要咬緊牙關，負起責任來，去苦幹，硬幹，幹到人人愛用國貨，覺到用洋貨是恥辱，用國貨是光榮，漸漸删除了服用洋貨的心理，來建設一個愛用國貨的心理，根據了愛用國貨的心理，先從自身家庭做去，慢慢地普遍到全國同胞，大家都來躬行實踐，那麽無形中好像築了一座堅固的壁壘，縱有巧顔美色的外國貨來進攻，引誘，我們也絶對不會上他的當了；但是我們要怎樣來建設一個愛用國貨的心理呢？至少務須有下邊的三個條件：</p>
<p>（一）自信自尊　我們信任自己是一個愛國的國民，須先根本明瞭服用外貨與國貨的利害，並且認定愛用國貨是唯我獨尊，購買洋貨是卑劣無恥，世界上最榮耀最風光，除了愛用國貨之外，没有再過於此，造成愛用國貨，是增加聲價之秘訣，大家都會尊敬他。</p>
<p>（二）卑視洋化　愛用國貨的人，我們要尊敬他，反之就是穿洋貨的人，要卑視他了，從此後倘有洋化的人走來，我們就嗤之以鼻，遠而避之，積習旣久，服用洋貨的人，或許會自慚形穢，而改變其習慣了。</p>
<p>（三）力求自强　洋貨是亡人家國的利器，我們便應卽刻回頭，力求自强，從今始，寳貴着我們金錢，立定着我們志向，來做愛用國貨的救國工作。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c26">怎樣免除「同業競賣」 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>——國貨當前的一大問題</p>
<p>在現下，我們倘談起國貨問題，那麽誰也不會忘了破壞國貨生命，阻礙國貨進展的兩把尖刀，——一是外來的洋貨，一是在華外廠的出品，認他是振興國貨前途所急需剷除的對象，但，捨此而外，那知道，在另一方面，國貨，工廠本身，自己却也正在「飲酖止渴」，犯着一個極嚴重的死症，他的危機，他的影響，實在較前兩者「有過之無不及」，這就是——「同業競賣」，原來，這一個惡魔，在目下，却也隨着經濟恐慌，市面不景氣的籠罩下，於國貨界當前極度活躍，這是值得我們提出來討論的。</p>
<p>我們知道，「同業競賣」，雖說是商戰劇烈，自由貿易下，不可避免的一回事，不過，它在我國，因爲没有合理的制裁，和國人自私的觀念太深，整個的計劃不顧，所以，它的猖獗，是益發不可收拾。在最近，因爲南旱北水，舉國皆災，農村經濟，是加速的崩潰，購買力日見薄弱，影響到國貨業銷路的减退，生産過剩，於是價格益見低落。並且，又製造次貨，迎合顧客心理，而市面混淆，黑暗和紊亂，充滿着各個工業，據我知道，現下巳有少數新興工業，售價竟低至成本以下，其他的自不必說，這種現象這種情勢，在振興國貨的前途，自是一個很大的癥結，必須設法急速解决，現在，敢以我之見，將他治標的兩個步驟，列之於下：</p>
<p>（一）釐訂價目　先由各個同業公會，速行召集會員大會，議定價目章程，共同遵守，並由各廠繳入證金，公開銷貨帳略，以便公會得隨時查核，如有違章，得没收其證金。</p>
<p>（二）肅淸次貨　偷工减料，次貨盛銷，實亦係國貨工業自走没落之路，值此危機，必須由公會通告各廠，急行肅淸，勿再製造，一面力求正貨成本之减輕，削低售價以利大衆。</p>
<p>雖然，根本的解决，自在國貨工業自身的憬悟，澈底的感覺，要知「同業競爭」，無異是一種「自殺政策」，尤其在我國工業幼稚，尙在襁褓的時代，這「自相踐踏」，勢必「兩敗俱傷」，並且「鷸蚌相爭」，東西洋的漁翁，正在露着他猙獰的微笑，而加緊工作，謀從中獲利呢。</p>
<h3 id="c27">組織國貨宣傳隊的建議 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>學生利用星期餘暇</p>
<p>深入農村民間宣傳</p>
<p>提倡國貨，服用國貨，嘴裏喊起來倒也非常容易，但是實行起來，可是與非常容易適得其反，而成爲非常困難。所以不管是國貨年或是婦女國貨年，那洋貨仍是像水一般的流入；而我國的金錢呢？就像水一般的流出：雖然同是一流，外國人却流得喜笑顔開，中國人呢？反流得面黄飢瘦，苦眉瞪眼！在這種狀况之下，當然我們要挽回這向外流出的金錢，使它逆流而上，流到我們中國人的腰包裏來！</p>
<p>任何人知道提倡國貨是國民應盡的責任和義務，但是提倡國貨怎會收不到効力呢？怎會依舊每年有幾萬萬元的漏巵呢？當眞中國人的心死了？當眞中國人的血冷了？我以爲不是這樣的；因爲中國人有百分之八九十没有受過敎育，以没有受過敎育的人，又没有人和他們解釋，他們怎知道要提倡國貨呢？而且愛過敎育的人，又有不能辨認貨物的是否國貨，以致受到欺騙，這也是時常發現的事。所以我以爲我們要擴大宣傳，而且要口頭宣傳，—口頭宣傳和文字宣傳，雙方並重，蓋口頭宣傳，是宣傳給不識字的人，文字宣傳，是宣傳給識字的人，所以都不可偏廢。—宣傳的目的，是（一）提倡國貨的意義；（二）辨别國貨的常識；關於口頭宣傳的宣傳人，最好是請學生們來担任。因爲他們可以利用星期餘暇，來組織「國貨宣傳隊」，去深入民間，和農村裏去宣傳。我想：這一定可以收到很大的効力的！我很希望各學校的學生，都來服務這種宣傳工作，使婦女國貨年得到最後的勝利！</p>
<p>國貨調查</p>
<h3 id="c28">國貨在温州 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 胡封</p>
<p>（温州通訊）温州，在一般人看來，似乎是值不得注意的地方。其實單就香烟一項，每年消費額竟達三四百萬元左右。</p>
<p>温州舊有六縣，或稱温屬六縣，這是就行政方面而言的如果就商業方面而言，温州實包括甌江上游處（處州）屬六縣。所以温州雖是一個小小的商埠，但其出入的貿易總數，總算足以在中國各通商口岸上佔着相當的地位。</p>
<p>依據歷年的統計，温州貿易總是入超的。這是因爲温州的生産品每年出口來得少，而消耗品的入口來得多。在這麽多的消耗品之中，合於温州人的心理要求的條件有二：</p>
<p>第一，價錢要便宜：</p>
<p>第二，花樣要新奇。</p>
<p>合於以上兩個條件的國貨固然有，但是東西一定不多。何况當這外貨大傾銷於我國的時候，在市塲上能够和外貨相競賣的東西到底有幾樣？所以國貨在温州的前路，必然没有多大的希望。</p>
<p>在目前，爲着新生活運動的實行，致使一般民衆衝動於一時的熱血，什麽反日會，提倡服用國貨會等等組織，都是應運而生。同時上海中國國貨公司，也在温州分設中國國貨公司的大商店，居然也於十月十日正式開幕，上海派了王振芳王性堯二君來温指導，最近的營業，聽說很是發展，將來怎樣？我當然不能武斷。但貨價如能便宜，貨樣如能新奇，倘或這樣的東西多多發售於温州中國國貨公司，那末我可保證這公司必定能够永久存在於温州。否則，五分鐘，過去了，温州中國國貨公司恐亦隨五分鐘而過去罷！</p>
<p>藍布衫曾在温州一度風行過，現在呢？這正足以證明國貨在温州的前路是怎樣！</p>

<p>胡嫂子嘴一撇道：喲！你誇什麽嘴？西關水我家裏果然没有，你家裏也不見得有吧？這是人家的水，你沾點光，在這裏作事天天有得喝……他說着，眼看甲茶房臉上紅了，這便轉了笑容道：我和你鬧着玩的，你可别生氣。說着，就拿了另一隻杯子斟了一碗茶，送到他面前，笑道：回敬你一杯。那茶房便是想板住臉，也板不住，只得一笑。那乙茶房抱了兩隻手臂在懷裏，笑道：胡嫂子，你爲人不公道。胡嫂子不等他說到第二句，巳經另倒二杯茶，送到他手上，乙茶房接着茶，向他微微一彎腰，笑道：胡嫂子做出事來眞是厲害，讓人哭不得，笑不得。胡嫂子歎了口氣道：巴結你二位，這不算害羞的事，窮人對窮人，總應當格外好一點。乙茶房向甲茶房笑道：聽到没有，這是我們胡嫂子先打好了矮樁在這裏，那件事務動了，就要我們在裏頭貼嘴說話了。胡嫂子又不等甲茶房說完，只管向他二人努嘴夾眼晴。這兩人向屋子外面看時，原來正是張李兩位先生回來了。他二人臉上，全是笑容，却不比平常，茶房搶去開房門時，後面又進來一位穿長衣服的先生，他走兩步，却向後頭望着，笑道：只管進來，要什麽緊？說着，將手向裏揮着。於是在這時，進來一個二十上下的女人，上身穿了一件藍色軟緞的旗袍，沿着白辮。黑頭髮，微微彎曲著，只平後腦，顯然是那不高明的理髮師燙的。長長的臉子，一雙大眼晴，高鼻子，雖有黑的留海髮，紅的胭脂，白的香粉，可是在他兩腮上乾瘦下去的肉，無論如何，是不能修飾得更豐潤起來的。（七○）</p>

<h3 id="c32">談蟹畫 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 適園</p>
<p>蟹畫在中國，不知始於何時。大約自宋元以來，寫生畫風行，有名的畫家，於人物山水之外，往往兼繪蟲魚，蟹當然是他們寫生的對象之一。不過流傳於後世者，很不多見，不比宋徽宗的鷹，趙子昻的馬，差不多到處有之。我二十年前，隨使節到法國，在巴黎博物館裏，看見過一幅中國蟹畫，頗爲工細，紙色很古，無署欵，有内府收藏印章，大槪是元明人之作，據說是庚子聯軍掠去的。民國初年，我在袁項城幕中，看見白陽山人的小册數幅，其中一幅是繪蟹的，筆墨超逸，眞是名家，題句云：「竟夕匐匍無十丈，世界猶說是橫行。」蓋亦有爲而發。後來我在琉璃廠古董肆裏，看見一幅曾衍東的畫蟹，筆簡神足，題云：「看爾橫行到幾時？」據廠肆主人說：曾衍東做縣令時，上司强索他畫，作作此諷剌之，後便因此得罪。同治年間，趙悲盦遊幕柬甌，海邊水産多異物，悲盦曾繪一幅蟹圖，自大蝤蠓以至小蟛蜞，多至二十餘種，題曰：「一蟹不如一蟹。」悲盦之畫，遠勝於書，而世罕知之。近時畫家喜繪蟹者，我最佩服馬孟容，筆墨高雅，天分工力兼到。我數年前，在上海展覽會裏，看見他的一幅蟹，馬公愚題云：「結隊披堅執銳，原來無腹無腸，任爾橫行江海，酒邊終伴橙薑，」蓋痛憤當時軍閥擁兵橫行，而譏之也。近日又看見孟容的一幅蟹，馬公愚題云：「又是持蟹賞菊天，聯吟聯畫憶當年，容齋寥寂忽經歲，展讀斯圖淚湧泉！」聞孟容在一二八後無多時，卽歸道山，我未獲識荆，至今惜之。（不受酬）</p>
<p>（鵑按，孟容畫蟹，自是老斵輪手。顧愚所藏僅有杜鵑枝上杜鵑啼及紫藤二幅，恨不能起孟容於地下，丐其一圖無腸公子也。思之腹痛！）</p>
<h3 id="c33">一日之樂 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>照例：十月！廢歷的十月，該可算是農村的歡樂的季節了。因爲在那時候，穀是堆在塲上，米是藏在囤裏，棉花和豆菜之類，易錢的易錢，自用的自用，一歲的饑寒問題，差不多可以解决；那末，以往的「百日之勞，」自當取償於「一日之樂，」以資精神上的調劑了。所以每屆這個十月，農村中人，不論男婦老幼，表情上總是含着一種歡樂成份。然而，眼前怎樣呢？不是也屆這個歡樂的季節的十月了嗎？但我姑且暫按眼前的現實，先憑追憶上描寫一下他們！農人照便歡樂的舊影吧。我想，這在農人們見了，也許很够回味的，咀嚼的，特别是處在眼前的這種境地。</p>
<p>這自然是種迷信的行動；但是農人們没機會到電影院看影戲，更没資格進跳舞塲跳舞，進考而夫塲打球，當然只有從傳統的迷信歡念上去追尋他們所需要的歡樂了。所以在廢歷十月中的一副農人行樂圖，不外是「出會」與「做社的兩種方式；而這兩種行樂，又同以迎神作中心的。先說「出會」：出會也稱做「賽會」，是拿他們最信仰的一種偶像，集合多數人分掌旗幟鼓號，和一切應有的儀仗，抬着這神像或一天，或一天以上的巡游各村；逢到那村莊招待這神像的，例須歡宴會中人，大家乘此暢叙一下。所以那時間不但會中人快樂，便是並無關係的農村中人，因爲可以乘此「看會，」故也無不快樂，簡直可以稱之曰「皆大歡喜，」至於「做社，」那範圍比「出會」小，在做社時，祇聯合數家至數十家爲「社友，」在「社主」家裏也宴請一種神像，同時，也就是社友們殺猪宰羊的大嚼一頓；這種做社，是含有感謝歲收和祈禱年豐的意義。其實，這無非是「百日之勞，一日之樂」罷了。</p>
<p>以上—出會與做社，當然是種迷信的行動，因爲這是迷信的行動，所以應該破除的，禁止的。但是在這農村巳告破産的年頭，他們—農人勤勞艱苦，胼手胝足的耕種了一年，結果，除了受厄於天災人禍，更須繳租納糧之外，還不够吃一頓飽飯，穿一件暖衣：行見將委溝壑，散四方，那裏還有餘緖閒錢？謀得這「一日之樂」的享受！所以這種迷信行動，早巳不必破除禁止，而自破除禁止了。</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>晚秋的夕陽太好了，淡淡地照紅了新　的碎石大道，一匹瘦馬馱着破車，我們坐在破車上，不用腰脚；自會有山野的風光，流進眼瞳。閣門的馬糞氣息，和討嫌的車夫兜攬生意的語調不復聽見，白牆的留園也就滑過，西指左邊濃翠的戒幢律寺，眞像是瑞士深夏中瀕河的山村烟景。</p>
<p>這裏有着挺闊的草原，界在稻田中間，看前面離開十丈之遥的一輛馬車在飛塵裏跳躍，能够懸想到新西蘭秋收的情狀。有時三五個少年軍官，競賽似的騎馬劈面奔來，又會給這靜穆冲淡的境界，微微地劃破了一絲刀痕，露出難堪的騷擾。眞的，素來習慣于恬逸生活中的我是不羨慕指揮刀與勳章的。能够「采菊東籬下，悠然見南山，這「悠然」的情味，我很珍惜。</p>
<p>馬車夫坐在拉韁的高墊上，一鞭又一鞭的打着瘦馬，雖然有一點感慨，但看看西斜的夕陽，和跟在車後的許多江北孩子連跑連拜的在向我們乞錢，多丢了些銅子也就泰然了。</p>
<p>風駛過臉子，在陽光裏；巳經有一點冬的消息。拉起衣領打了個寒噤，偷偷地念了句：「已凉天氣未寒時。」抬起眼來，在沓遠的海湧山頭，重見了一座美麗的塔尖，正倚在澄碧的秋空裏，沉默得精緻。</p>
<p>憑河的山塘小鎭，也漸漸落進車篷，在一條石橋下的一片荒塲上，我們下了車。</p>
<p>虎邱原是一個培塿，高不過百三十尺，凡是四方旅行的人，决不會對它發生情人似的依戀；然而在我，雖然愛過天台雁蕩匡廬黃山；同時却也愛那山的一角，水的一涯。我對於虎邱，正像對於黿頭渚一樣地感覺到伊的玲瓏，幽靜，整潔，像一位幽嫻樸學的女郎似的。如故在六月中旬雨過的黃昏裏，你踏上磚石雜鋪的山磴，兩面的翠微氣韻，流出淡香，那樣淸新的甜醉了心胸，這便是虎邱的特色。而且闢地不多，結搆最是緊悄，没有一處空隙，但也没有一處不高爽靈奇。</p>
<p>我們溜進了山門，一步步走上去，就有賣白蘭花的小姑娘，亦步亦趨的要我們買伊幾箭。我根本嫌惡那些渾濁的濃香，對伊搖搖頭，表示不要，但伊用着求憐的語調在說：</p>
<p>「先生，買奴一箭　，三個銅板！」</p>
<p>不错，伊賣花，要的是錢，我便掏出銅板丢入伊的花籃裏，並且給伊說明我不要那種香得惱人的花的理由。然而伊似乎不好意思起來了「那末領你們上去吧！」伊說。當時使我感覺到這個人所受的不安，遠超過我所受的。但我决計回絶伊：</p>
<p>「不用領的，我們常到這兒來虽茶。」我一跳便跳上了搭有蘆棚的虎邱商店。繼着竄向冷香閣去，在石磴上回頭看時，那小姑娘正躊躇地凝凝花籃裏。我的心沉重着！。</p>
<p>靠在石檻上約略看了遠近的峯巒，脚下的雲烟竹樹，便仍沿女貞碧列的曲徑回出，打石觀音殿經過，溜下去瞧第三泉，這地方，很像匡廬的黄龍洞，不過没有瀑布而巳。再下是劍池，浮着一潭萍綠的泉水，並無「風壑雲泉」意未，倒是向上看雙吊桶的石橋上，有一個穿着紅衣裳的女人走過，恰好被襯在兩壑懸下的靑籐翠葉裏，這人影很小，眞是一幅窈窕幽雅的畫圖。從這裏殘磴上向左前進，走完了雙吊桶橋，那一片荒草曠地上，右邊站着蒼顔欲墮的虎邱塔，左邊坐着壯健淸新的虎伏閣。在虎伏閣後面的風牕裏，窺探海湧峯下周圍的畦田山樹，屋舍漁樵，紅的霜楓，黃的烏桕，也雜着不知名的各色野花，眞是好看得很。（未完）</p>

<p>這裏所用的蠟燭，都是很大很大的，也許是特地製就的，但在我們用慣電燈的人看來，光綫還是很黯淡。在這一條曲尺式的長廊下，三面各掛着十支，可是他們的掛法却異常特别，竟是我以前所從未見過的。因爲以前我所常見的，不是揷在桌子上的燭臺上，便是掛在壁上的燭臺上，這裏却全是用的燈籠。燈籠本不是一件希罕的東西，紙糊的，玻璃鑲的，我也見過幾千幾百種以上了，但從不曾見過用牛角一類的東西來製就的燈籠，而且這些角燈都是製得很薄，差不多有玻璃一樣的透明。中國手工業的産品，往往會有遠非機械所能念及的奇跡，這種角燈，便是一個例子。</p>
<p>所有的蠟燭的顔色全是大紅的·——其他的顔色，都是認爲不吉利的，當然絶對不能用。——每一支約莫有一尺半長，可不能算小了，然而那個燈籠的本身，却並不大，只是恰好能够容納這支蠟燭而巳。所以我想在初點的時候，必然是非常費力的，而且很危險，也許會把燈籠燒掉；但這裏的太監，却巳練就了一種很好的手法，非但在初點的時候，一些不覺困難，便是燒燈籠的事情，也决不會有的，——至少，當我留在奉天的那幾日裏，從不曾有過。在這角燈的頂部，分三點角繫着一條銅練：這樣，這個燈便可以穩定了。而在這三條銅練結合的一端上，還有一個銅鈎，待燈蠟燃旺之後，就把這個鈎子去掛在廊下的橫樑上，讓它高高地懸着。（一八○）</p>

<h3 id="c37">關于咬文嚼字 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 林林</p>
<p>作家要把創作的東西，活現於讀者的面前，抓得讀者的心窩，首先要看其「内容是什麽？」其次，「怎樣來表現内容的？」，在此，我們就是說，由内容而至形式的，形式是依内容來主導的，同時，形式的好壞，也能影響到内容，這辯證的聯繫。因而作家要技巧而精確地來描寫他的内容卽現實，於是就不能抹殺形式上的諸問題。</p>
<p>旣然不能抹殺（並且要注意）形式上的諸問題，那麽，我們就能在形式上的諸問題裏面，而來確立一個關子咬文嚼字的題目。我們自然不是說：用一種舞筆弄墨的花樣，專在字眼做工夫，以五顔六色的綺辭麗語，來迷醉讀者的眼晴。没有内容，任你形式如何鋪張，很難得價值的。四六駢體文之被擺到古物陳列所去，並非無因。我們始終是以現實的題材，來作爲内容的中心。作家要描得逼眞，寫得切實，不消說，是需要對於用語，用字，應費一部分工夫來斟酌來研究的。在下面就分幾點來說明。</p>
<p>（一）在一篇作品裏，往往爲了一句或一字的巧拙，而影響到全作品的出色與否的關係。這種例子多得很，譬如宋祁寫了一句一紅杏枝頭春意鬧一，爲了用下一個「閙」字，而全境就活現於讀者的眼前了。被稱爲「紅杏」尙書者，那不是偶然的。</p>
<p>（二）我們不贊成賈島式的也許爲雅俗問題的推敲。他爲看「僧推月下門」和「僧敲月下門」就弄得猶豫不决。在我們看來——依着寫實方法的原則，假如那個和尙是推着門的情景，我們就用「推」字；是敲着門的情景，我們就用「敲」字，按着原原本本的現實來描寫，用不着粉飾的。但是，如果那和尙把門又推又敲的話，這就難怪他煞費工夫在「推敲」上了。</p>
<p>（三）字句的安揷位置或顚倒位置，也很有關係，往往給與讀者以大大不同或相反的槪念。記得曾國藩在與所請「長毛賊」方面抗衡的某一時期，曾將呈表淸朝報告戰况，中有「屢戰屢敗」之句，有一位幕友替他改爲「屢敗屢戰」，這就把那種「無能」　　爲「苦鬥掙扎和餘勇可鼓的精神」了。這種歪曲事實的咬文嚼字，是很有害的。讀者非對照事實去看不可。</p>
<p>（四）像一點精液而滲泡了許多水一樣，倒是有傷于原質，這是不足取的。我們要用最經濟的，最簡潔的字句，表現最完全的，最美滿的槪念。便如林和靖的一首山圜小梅詩：</p>
<p>疎影橫斜水淸淺，</p>
<p>暗香浮動月黄昏。</p>
<p>他用聊除幾筆，輕描淡寫，可是就給與讀者一個又眞又美的印象了。這可說作者抓着了現實的精采處，又能以技巧的手法來形象化。這區區十四字，就勝如洋洋的大文了。雖則樣式，風格各有不同，但理論上則全是一致的。　　在這裏，我們又要提出二點：第一就是作者在表現上要咬文嚼字，讀者在讀一種作品時，同樣是需要咬文嚼字的，甚至讀者自己也設身做爲那作品的作者來看待，迫尋甚麽是表得妙，甚麽是現得好，這樣才能理解作品内容的眞實性。第二就是說我們並非要作者先亞好咬文嚼字工夫，再去寫作。乃相反地要在寫作，來發展，來洗練作者的咬文嚼字及其它諸重要的技巧。</p>
<p>然而，依上面的叙述，咬文嚼字旣具有那樣重要的意義，那麽，作家要確切内容的槪念，或活現内容的槪念，應怎樣來用字用句呢？這個問題，很難答復的吧？但，我們可以回說幾點意見。第一，正如作家要在各種各樣的社會人羣裏面，摘出主要的典型人物一樣地，作家要在一切的字彙，句彙裏面，來選擇典型的字句，并且，作家具備字彙，句彙得多，則選擇越自由，則表現得越完滿。次之，客觀的現實，一天一天的演進與複雜化，表現着這現實的工具、也跟着要演進與複雜化。我們，於是，不但不能固守着讀得很順此，看得很順眼的老字句，同時要儘可能地創造一些新的字句來，無論是接受外來語也好，採用土話方言也好，這樣，才不僅工具本身能發展下去，而且，内容的表現也更要完全些美滿些。我們不能爲着一般國粹論家的一種「咬字嚼字」與「吹毛求疵」，而遲疑於嘗試，要知道如果現在不來開始，則終没有聽得順，看得順之一天的。最要緊的是第三：創作理論要用寫實方法，我們用字用句，也同樣要用寫實方法。高爾基在關於創作技術一文中說道：「文學的作品，爲值得藝術之名——須賦與作品以完全的言語的形式。賦與此種形式於故事或小說的東西，就是素朴的，正確的，明澈的，簡約的言語。」</p>
<p>最後，更應該注意的：問題的重要性，不是在形式上的咬文嚼字——用字用句的推敲，這不過是一個小小的題目罷了，而第一重要的還是作家要正確對于客觀現實的理解，務使創作的生活經騐具有豐富性，多樣性與眞實性，在這範圍之内，我們來咬文嚼字才有意義，才能把題材賦與完美的藝術　形式。</p>

<h3 id="c38">大學生與跳舞 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 丁世昌</p>
<p>要不是報上登載了禁止學生跳舞的新聞，在下當眞相不到原來大學生倒是跳舞塲的主顧。這一件事發生後，很引起「輿論」的注目。最近有一位先生分析大學生跳舞的原因：（一）是大學生家裏有錢，（二）是社會環境使人夫望煩悶，（三）是敎育没有辦得好，（四）是上海這地方太壞。</p>
<p>於是結論就到了各大學現行的「禁舞政策」是治標的，難有效果：根本救濟之法在於（一）充實學校内容，（二）設法澄淸社會秩序使人减少煩悶，（三）少給錢與大學生，（四）提倡正當娱樂與游戲，（五）大學敎授以身作則，（六）社會輿論的製裁；（七）交際舞可鼓勵，其他舞道應加鄙視。</p>
<p>話得說回來，各大學現行的「禁舞政策」是怎樣的呢？據說是每晚點名，並派人到舞塲去調查。</p>
<p>不用說，各大學禁舞的政策恐怕不會有滿意的效果；然而根本救濟之法因爲是牽涉到整個社會環境之大，未必一時遂能施行。譬如說，跳舞狂原因中間的後三項都不是枝枝節節解决得了的。便如第四項上海這地方太壞，因爲上海是國際的都市，「國際矛盾現象都表現於此」；然而要使上海成爲非國際的中國的都市，正不知何年何月能够辦到。</p>
<p>卽使上海成爲中國的都市了，「矛盾現象」！國際的乃至國内的，何嘗遂不會「表現於此」？</p>
<p>從前上海不是没有不正當的娱樂，妓院有的是；從前上海的大學生也不少富人的子弟；然而從前不大聽見大學生逛妓院，現在跳舞狂却成了問題，這中間大槪還有一個緣故。這緣故，倘使去問常走舞塲的人，他一定要脫口回答道：因爲跳舞價廉而且手續簡單，袋裏有幾塊錢就可以進去跳幾跳。</p>
<p>這種價廉而手續簡單的不正當的「娱樂」，說起來倒也是一種的「現代化」。而這「現代化」的造成，也有本國内在的原因，就是農村經濟破産，到都市來找工作的女人太多，都市吸收不了，結果只好出賣肉體了。</p>
<p>所以小小一個大學生跳舞的問題，倘使尋根究柢起來，便不得了：大學生跳舞是應得禁止的，可是要推論到如何方可以不禁自止，如何方可以使要跳的人無處可跳，這却是大費周章的問題了。</p>

<p>「不感到難過嗎？」我探問妻分娩的經過。</p>
<p>「那裏，痛得很呢！你爲何不早點來。」</p>
<p>「想不到這樣快呢。」</p>
<p>嬰孩的哭聲忽然截斷了我和妻的談話，我卽刻從看護婦手上抱了過來。小小的生命重重地壓着我的靈魂，因爲做父親不是空口說白話的啊！孩子的生活，敎育，不是由我一人料理的嗎？</p>
<p>「給我看看吧。」妻在床上張着手要孩子。</p>
<p>我立刻遞過去。</p>
<p>「啊，啊。」妻得意地摸摸孩子的黄嫩的頭髮。同時一種慈愛的眼光落在孩子的身上。</p>
<p>其實，妻時常這樣說：「孩子們太多不好的，要敎養，要費心，有時要淘氣，他們的傷風冷熱又要掛心。做父母無異於做半馬啊！」但是今天爲何這麽親暱呢，我眞有些出乎意外。這一定是慈母的愛的照耀吧？這偉大的母愛這時一定在妻的内心汹湧了吧！</p>
<p>在産後的某個晚上，我和妻開玩笑了。</p>
<p>「芳，累你了，以後再不要……！」</p>
<p>妻摺一摺嘴，終於嗤的一聲笑了。</p>
<p>這時孩子的哭聲又尖銳地剌進我的心裏。於是我又想起了無辜的孩子又被某支毒箭剌傷了他的心胸了。</p>

<h3 id="c41">殘廢者（Zsigmoud　Moricz著） <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 叔莊譯</p>
<p>Zslgmond　Moricz是匈牙利現代作者的被注意的一人，他善寫快樂的田野，與簡單的質樸的農民，這一篇短篇小說，很能表出他的特點。　　譯者識。</p>
<p>我們到了村落的中間。</p>
<p>在我們的四圍是無限的荒地。平原整齊得竟使我們只看到天邊的淸楚的一綫與穹蒼的整個的弓形。在十分淸明的天空，飄着大塊的雲，好像快樂的旗子，一捧一捧的美麗的綢，懸掛在您頭的上面……。</p>
<p>可是我的朋友，他並不看着天，他的眼晴，嚴厲而冷酷的眼晴只是朝着地。這塊地是他的，周圍約一千「阿克」，（約合八千畝——譯者）。</p>
<p>「眞麻煩！」他說：「在現今這年頭兒耕種一千阿克的田眞是麻煩！農業的生産品的價值低得不能再低了，工業品的價值高到雲端。人家借了債，以爲一定可以很容易的還出，因爲麥可以賣到三十六個「朋國」（匈牙利錢幣——譯者），但現在麥只賣得六個「朋國」，債還是原來的債………。</p>
<p>他拏他的手杖隨便掘着泥土，這塊泥土也還是先前那塊出産值三十六個「朋國」的麥的同樣的泥土，像從前一樣的肥沃。</p>
<p>「最使你爲難的，是那些混蛋短工人。他們只知道罷工，只知道請求增加工錢…就是我虧本，他們也不管。」</p>
<p>忿忿的，他又沉在他的思想裏了，接着說：</p>
<p>「但是今年我不讓這些混蛋閙了。去年冬天，我弄得只留着三個半人。所有的工作，都是這三個半人做的。」</p>
<p>「怎麽啦？」</p>
<p>「這是很簡單的，……秋天，我呌他們耕地及播種麥與裸麥。剩下來的事就讓老天去完成……至於家畜，我把多下來的賣掉了，因爲我收起來的草料不够，我决不會那麽傻的去買革料。並且，這些家畜現在買起來比秋天便宜得多，我現在可以出便宜的價錢買我的需用的家畜。只不過多得使我難以選擇。冬天，三個人巳儘够照管家畜及洗滌家畜棚了。」</p>

<p>美棉産限制圖撤銷</p>
<p>紐約棉市開盤穩定、價格略高、大致係由於現貨行家及國外方面購買所致、旋以小麥暴跌、華爾街多頭出籠、農業部長華來斯聲稱新國會將設法取銷限止出産之舊規、市價回跌、全日中交易大部爲將十二月份籌碼掉至較遠月份、近收盤時現貨行家購進近期、空方抵補、同業亦乘低吸進、市價回穩、紗布市况平靜而堅、計現貨不動、期貨漲跌一至三磅音、英棉期貨跌一點、印棉市况呆滯無特色、計平果爾漲七角半、奥姆辣漲一·五羅比、白羅溪漲五角、原電錄左、（二十日電）</p>

<p>糧食　美麥大跌時之粉麥</p>
<p>期粉反呈俏利期麥僅小三分</p>
<p>美小麥爲國外市况萎疲、西南部多麥區業己得雨、致引起多頭獲利了結、加以玉米奥股市軟弱、市價因此下跌二分有餘、外麥進口之說、來屬不利、謠傳法國將增加其出口數目、因國外小麥價格較低、美麥與加麥之實銷、感受影響、今更因存貨稀少、聞將進口、故美麥與加麥之價格是否太高、不無疑問、</p>

<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈鬆落疲滯之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥回跌六七角左右、坎拿大跌二三角左右、故開價時、以麥之驟小、市塲人心、一致鬆動、本月份開價、即較前日跌二分、小至三角八分半、遠期各月份、亦小一分零、惟各廠未有抛售、業外人心、繼有收進、故開盤一鬆之後、旋則又轉定勢也、迨至下午開盤、初仍平疲、旋因廠家收回本月份、南洋帮如福州汕頭等帮、對於回籠貨、頻有抽裝、故市面又逐步帶緊、遠期則出戶甚少、業外略有吸進、致市氣反呈俏利、後步升沉、須看洋麥之是否續定、當爲前途之樞紐也、結果本月份不動、十二月份好二厘半、一月份好七厘半、二月份不動、三月份好二厘半、四月份好七厘半、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥方面、上午開盤後、各月份呈停寂異常之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥雖小六七角、坎拿大小二三角左右、惟以交易日淸、各方買賣、同時觀望、故祇十一十二月份略有做開、價小一二分、餘均未開、迨至下午開盤、各月份市氣、巳轉疲滯、因上午粉市轉疲、及洋麥之驟小、是以各盤開價、步見軟弱、此種波動、殆受粉市之激動歟、結果十一月份較跌三分、十二月份跌六分、一月份跌三分、二三月份未動、現麥市面、仍見穩固、交見則尙暢旺、開山東白麥三元八角二三分、海州麥三元八角二分、瑤灣麥三元八角、南宿州麥三元八角二分、由福新去七千包、阜豐去二千包云、</p>
<p>河米到淡回上角餘</p>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源較昨尤稀、祇共二十五六號、貨共四千餘石、本街銷塲頗能動動、市况漸有轉定之勢、作客絡繹而至、售方極度喊高雖客帮包胃全數停辦、結果晚稻價終能回起角砠至角餘、各帮厚粳更以貨稀出色升二角之砠、惟杜洋尖續受客尖影響、尙難立足、又跌角許、陰元以到源忽旺、兼酒戶轉懈、猝瀉一二角二等、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路來源二十三四號、市上各貨去胃、新更本街早市銷活、午市轉淡、包胃不動、羊杜埠客尖薄稻亦好、新陳白元陰元另拆平常、酒戶略動、市形新更早市高貨加角外、中次加二三角、午市轉定、羊杜尖稍帶緊、其陳白元陰元價形平疲、新白元價小一二角、早薄稻價加角許、餘貨平定、</p>
<p>洋商抛售期洋米甚勁</p>
<p>—客秈銷活轉緊—</p>
<p>昨洋米現貨甚活、因河卞米價提後、本街胃口漸貪、内地亦有問津、故上午續小五分後、旋即站住、然新交易逐有洋商求攬、昨合義又出四月份五百噸、雅利出三四月各五百噸、價又續小三五分、現洋米開出西貢三千八百包、安南更暹邏米等七百九十一包、多數爲本街辦去、客秈連跌後、昨内地帮與本街又趁小活動、市乃先平後緊、如今後去化再旺、或須步砌也、各秈共開七千八百十包、内地與本街分去、</p>
<p>黃豆再漲一角</p>
<p>通　請亦起採辦</p>
<p>昨日黃豆市面飛俏、新豆來源輪運不斷、漲六七分、陳豆去路、有錫常帮及廠家外、多一通州帮問津、致市猛提一角外、刻下陳貨底積、祗有四五萬包、去路不衰、人心與市氣有直上靑雲之勢、計全市交易頴州陳豆二十三四車、價目三元五角至五角半、新豆成交大連之范家屯·開原·海城·四平街十二三車、價目四元至三元七角七、由内地圍坊及汕頭本街等採去、其他各新豆成交一千四五百包、由本街内地辦去云、</p>
<p>海味魚膠蟄皮俏疲不同</p>
<p>魚膠　據查今庚洋生並未旺發、故各産地來貨儘屬有限、比較上年約减三分之一、惟因洋莊勿動、更兼國内需要亦少發展、致行號乎貨、呆擱長存、雖願從廉脫卸、苦無問津之人、現市提片價一百五十元、吊片一百三十元、黄片一百二十五元、長膠一百十元、</p>
<p>海蟄皮　街底不多、市面穩定、昨到泗礁貨二百七十四件、價開十三元三角、當由各行家、分派而通、要手頗俏云、</p>

<h3 id="c56">死 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>死，是很簡單的一回子事，一股氣透不上來的時候，就死了。</p>
<p>世界没一樣生物不有死的，所以在「不死之藥」還没有被人發明之前，一切人類都没有長生的希望，「野山人參」，「人壽保險公司」的仿單和保單上，亦並未書明主顧的壽命應延長多久。死之於人，旣是必然的，而且人人不能避免的，其不爲人所畏懼，自亦宜矣。</p>
<p>然而，上面說的，是指「壽終正寢」者。處今之世，除死於壽終正寢外，死於非命的數不勝數，更有死於非命而不明不白的，亦屢見不鮮。這裏所謂人生保障也者，等於什麽？那我不敢說，</p>
<p>「閻王註定三更死，定不留人到五更。」假定眞的有閻王的話，那亦要閻王親自派鬼來提才好，所謂「死亦瞑目」也。可是偏偏有人在白天的陽世大道上，突遭狙擊而死，兇手旣非閻王，亦非小鬼，却正是活生生的漢子，他能够楊長而來，又揚長而去，他更能够從容不迫地如殺鷄般地殺死了好幾個人命。被殺的人生前一無寃家，二無對頭，然則主宰人類生命的，不在「陰間」而在「陽世」耶。</p>
<p>不論死於鬼或死於同類的人，總要明明白白，死者固巳矣，而生者好得到一個解釋。「來得淸，去得明」，死是遲早間的問題，今日致人於死的，他日自己亦一樣要死。「善有善報，惡有惡報」的因果之說尙未眞實被人否定的現在可以說今之要人家性命的，將來許會反被人家要去性命。互以性命爲爭，其結果的損失，當然屬於社會。</p>
<p>這樣說來，死，果很簡單，非命的不明白的死，却亦很複雜的。</p>
<p>人們在今日之下，倒並不希望有什麽「不死之藥」的發明，而是迫切地冀求着可靠的「生之保障」，</p>
<h3 id="c57">關於取締腐化稱呼 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 吳飛</p>
<p>稱呼之在我國是有代表變換的現實性的，而且從稱呼上可以看得出階級制度與腦筋新舊，譬如從前封建時代的相公公子少爺老爺，太太夫人小姐奶奶等，甚至還有員外院君。這些不甚熟悉的名稱，係奴才小人一樣可以舊小說中得之。學生子稱先生爲夫子，身稱則晚生：有時還要冠上一個大人，這里就十足地可以看得出各種階級的不同，和封建色彩的濃厚。到了現在二十世紀的時候，人類開化，物質文明，我們亦巳被稱爲世界人（根據某書所載），那末像這種腐化的稱呼自然是不適用了。况且，根據人類平等的原則，也不應該在稱呼上有什麽階級的存在。可是我國迄至今日，古老頑固的思想，依然没有根本剷除，所以那種陳腐稱呼還會在一般所謂貴族化的大家庭里，或那些保古家的口里送出。當然我們不能讓這僅有的遺毒存在，雖然這於實際没有太礙，但無形中却在暴露着時代的落伍，並且破壞了人羣平等的陣綫，所以應該淘汰！</p>
<p>據本月十八日某報南京電稱：「内部頃通令各省，取締老爺太太小姐少爺等腐化稱呼，以免貽笑外邦，並悉令飭嗣後一律改稱先生老先生或學生云」。本來我國的稱呼委實太複雜了；正如方言一樣，莫說各省各地互異，就是在同一個區域内，也有着很多似是而非，似非而是的不同稱呼，如爺爺爸爸爹爹，仁兄老兄老哥等。</p>
<p>現在專制已經廢除，老爺少爺太太小姐等階級稱呼，根本就没有存在的可能，我們要是再去襲用它，那眞是不啻已承認復古，自己承認回到封建專制的時代。我們放着簡便合理的先生不用，何必一定要去摹仿封建專制，追求這種階級觀念　稱呼呢？我眞不明白：我想最普通最適當的稱謂莫若用先生兩字，遇着老輩却不妨稱他一聲老先生。那種旣平等又順口的稱呼，不分階級，無論貴賤，上至國府主席，下及勞工僕役，都可適用；本來稱呼雖非大道，但在一國之内也應該需要統一的。</p>
<p>從腐化稱呼的應該廢除，而我更因此聯想到了寫信：我國古時代寫信，恒多砌詞堆句，客套廢話弄了洋洋一大篇，於是一封長篇累牘的信，往往在里面找不出幾句有關係的要緊話，而其空洞浮泛自毋待言。這在寫信的人是必恭必敬的搜盡了枯腸，預備向對方賣弄自己的才學，然而在看信的方面，却看得頭痛腦脹，結果還是莫明其妙，將要緊的話反而减少了力量，甚至還會誤事。這種於人無益，於己有害的精神我想大可不必耗費：倒不如乾脆地直叙事實，言必有物，說得痛快，寫得明白，只要通俗，只要流暢，更不要忘記了簡括，三言兩語，皆可以，不拘文言白話，我們都不反對。</p>
<p>這些拘泥古板的腐化態度，我們也得想法糾正他們，要像取締腐化稱呼一樣。</p>

<p>— 千代子</p>
<p>這似乎已償了我的夙願，能够在公園之畔賃得一椽小屋，自然是偶然的機緣，朋友告訴我這裏有這末一間適合於我的小屋，而且房租也是意外的便宜，這就是最大的問題，從前曾犧牲了不少時間在這一帶像獵犬似的搜尋，結果都是徒勞無功。</p>
<p>我的行裝那末簡便，從這個碼頭到那個碼頭，可以在决定了動身二小時之後立卽啟程，所以祗要經過幾條紅綠燈指揮下的馬路，房主人眞是驚奇我搬家的時間太迅速了。</p>
<p>在新的環境中彷彿處處使人興奮，其實，理由不是這樣單純，因爲實踐了我幾年來的夢想。這可以舉個例來說明，事無巨細，如果你偶然在舊書攤買得一册殘本，而這殘本正是你出了重價所没有徵求到的，我知道你這一天什麽事都是興奮，滿意，或者甚至延長到相當的時間。</p>
<p>所以我一反從前的好睡的習慣，祇要上海第一個聲音響起的時候，我巳憑窗眺望了。雖然我搬的時候巳是殘秋，現在更是冬初了，早上的風似乎另有一種新鮮的感覺，不像春風那樣的慷懶，不像夏風那樣的淸凉，我每天體味着這冬之晨風吹拂到身上的新感覺，却没有固定的字句可以比擬，成了一種又驚又愛的情况。</p>
<p>天色剛剛露白，對面公園中的樹梢像一抹米派的流水，隱約臨風飄然，簡或幾只不知名的小雀子啁啾而鳴，你一定挺直了胸襟，作深深的長呼吸，如果闔上了眼皮沉思一下，那自己的身體也有些飄飄然了。</p>
<p>但是這可寳貴的奇蹟僅是刹那間的勾留，等到房主人家的僕人推門進來的時候，眼前巳變換了一個世界。</p>
<p>這世界：有瞬息萬變的白雲，有金光萬道的初升之太陽，有遠處的汽笛之聲……這世界是動的。</p>
<p>自然，人類的生命是動的，如其永遠沉湎在安靜的世界中，或者你將變爲咒咀的態度來厭惡那刹那間的可寳貴的奇蹟。不過我没有這樣說不要動的世界，我說動的世界不及靜的世界。然而這裏所說的動的世界，能够瞧着它變換成騷擾的世界，在三百萬人口之中，不知佔到那一個最小的數字。</p>
<p>我就在這時候洗面漱口，挾了一册書到公園去，很多時候在門前遇見那送報的小姑娘。其實到公園去帶書報，不一定特地選擇了一個地位，像進圖書館似的認眞讀書，不過你唿着口哨，信步躅到了池邊，而適巧一只空的鐡沙椅等候着你，那就坐下去把書報攤在彩蓋上，隨意翻開了一面，你儘可以游目四囑，那邊新開了一叢花，幾條小魚悠的跳上水面來，或者一個似曾相識的姑郎笑着向你頷首，直到你眼皮感到疲倦的時候，那再把視綫拉回來在書報上休息一會，這裏或者有一則新奇的新聞，使你莞爾一笑，卽使翻幾張插畫或廣告也是相當有意義的。據說女人是手仗，書報在孤獨者或許可以兼這差使，你以爲怎樣？</p>
<p>歸去的時候，從一個賣花老嫗手中換來一束花，明知把她揷到我的胆瓶中是殘酷的，然而我没有把它作爲禮物去做更殘酷的事，所以從不感到這是於心有愧的。</p>

<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>一座乳黄色的建築，孤零地峙立在京滬綫的附近，牠的處境是寂寞的，雖說，臨近有着種花人家，田陌間開滿了紫的，橙黄的，緋紅的，大紅的，不知名的花，這些花，將是被運到城里的富貴之家，作案上淸供的。</p>
<p>是偶然的機遇吧！我像夢一樣地在那座乳黄色的建築里住下了，每天，淸晨起來，有着白衣侍者，捧着乳酪餅以及那東方味的一盃淸茶，小心的安置在我的餐桌上，等我回到休息室里，昨夜巳經抽完了的吉士牌的空殼，是不見了，另外放着一聽新開的三砲臺，於是，我在鴨綠絨的沙發上，靜靜地坐着吸烟。</p>
<p>生活是優閒而富裕的，自然，勸我到這所乳黄色的建築來的人，是含有很大的期望的，因爲，我是一個年靑人，年靑人愛力愛熱，也愛光明，因此，以前的生活是熱剌的，但是，當那種熱刺的生活不能再持續下去時，我的生活方式，更變了，而成爲灰色的，頽廢的，而又是流浪的，爲了這，我被强迫地進了這座乳黄色的建築，他們的意思是希望我靜靜地息養一年，從靜靜的自省中，重新的生活納入正軌去。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>也許他們那種自作聰明的打算，將是擲諸虚牝的，因爲，在我的心里，有一隻南國的海燕，飛進了又飛出，而是從來不肯逗留片刻的，所以，我的心怕要悴悴了，那末，要把生活弄曾更規律一點，是一件不容易事了。</p>
<p>每一個時間里，我在這乳黄色的建築物中，靜靜的坐着，聽一次一次從南京來，從上海去的列車，響着震耳的喧囂，從我的耳邊，近了，又遠了！</p>
<p>然而，在夜間，一絲華髮落到紅皮書上，也能聽到很大的聲音，而每一個聲音，每次挑動了我的心弦，使我憶起往昔的夢一般的日子，夢一般的日子中的，夢一般的挑色的事跡。</p>
<p>然而，當我安然地入夢了，却被一支支的凄厲的車笛聲喚寤，而夢中的甜酸苦辣，在我薄弱的記憶里是褪殘了！任我苦苦地儘一長夜的時間，來重復綴補，却依舊是殘了的呢？然而，每夜，我都是在做着一串串的殘了的夢哪！</p>

<p>豫籍靑年呂文淸，自大學畢業後因感受失業痛苦，遂趨於墮落之途，操偷竊之業，事敗判徒刑四月示儆。</p>
<p>不是我的朋友胡適之前與京日日社記者談話，本人執鞭北大，所見之大學畢業生甚多，除最少數特殊情形者外，大多能於畢業後謀得相當職…故欲任事愉快，無失業之慮，第一須有任事之能力與學識，…不能就業者當求其不能就業之原因，不必怨天尤人，而惟責之於巳，自己有能力，又何愁無飯吃…</p>
<p>這是博士的言論，自然說得很有分寸，像呂文淸這樣的大學生，恐怕博士吃大菜，抽雪茄之餘所永遠夢想不到的。「自作孽，不可活！」博士以爲然乎？</p>
<p>然而確是事實，新聞紙的編輯先生不見得故意造謠生事，然則，借博士的結語曰：「至於失業之救濟，則爲另一種社會問題，使失業者有業，亦社會應盡之責任云。」</p>
<h3 id="c62">舞場人物素描 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 小林</p>
<p>游離在這男人的隊裏邊的許多女人，都把各種平時被虚飾着的俗氣的嘴臉露了出來。看見了女同伴坐在那一邊，便跑了過去，自己給同伴的男人摟着腰在暗綠色的燈影下飄飄地地舞着。像是一種並不會對不住自己的男人的事。毫舞芥蒂地。男人如果亦這樣做：巴巴地走到别人的有男人的女同伴的桌子去，其間的反嚮可就不同了。卽使嘴唇上不曾說出怎樣不滿的話，其實不必用聲音傳達意思，那種突然變動的臉巳便是寫明着非常不滿的表示。心裏邊的閙别扭更不消說的了。</p>
<p>女人所特具的私私念頭在亭些時候頂容易不知不覺的表現出來。自己儘管可以跟其他的男人發生時間的摟抱關係，而却不准許男人跟其他的女人去接觸。這種下意識的思想大約有個女人都免不掉。她們擔心着會由時間性的摟抱關係進而爲超於時間性以上的轇轕要是成爲事實的話，就是等於對自身的愛的刼奪，所以都有了這樣的防預意外的行爲。但是男的感情旣可能發生尋常應酬之外的外溢作用，則女的一方自然同時亦可能發生同樣的外溢作用的。爲因人與人的中間的情感泛進是同一個形態的。但是多少的男子可未有計量到這上面。讓自己的女人去給朋友跳跳本是極其平凡的塲合。可没有那樣不信任人家甚至於阻撓女人一種酬應性質的自由行動。女人之比不上男人從這些地方可以看出來了。由於心造的某種可怖的幻影，她們的精神更不時被這幻影苦惱着。而尤其是混雜在更多的男人的舞塲的時候那幻影會不由地越濃厚起來。在瞥進來之前，她們的心境尙是充滿着愉快與喜悅，也許在一刹那之後，心境卽大大的起變化了。愉快與喜悅迅速的沉没。而整個兒給無端的憂慮籠罩着。倘男人在跟别個女人舞着的時間，並無意的多開幾句嘴，或是多流露一點笑容。所給予女人的覺感便更加痛苦，難堪，以至於將意識到似乎遭遺忘的悲哀了。</p>
<p>女人有這個男人所没有的狹窄的心田。因此所招領來的煩惱的確較男人來得多而且利害。有一些事不必那末認眞去計較，並且不必那末想法。然而女人們總喜歡那未認眞的計較，而未那末想法。無用掛念的也掛念着了。則各樣無謂的磨折亦還是自作自受的。不過男人們如若瞧透女人這層心事，不願意呌女人被自己所造出來的苦惱之網纏縛着。便不如少做那些可以減省的舉措，除跟自己的女人跳跳之外，不跟任何旁的女人跳，虧得女人無故受苦。故此單個兒的男子寂寞地守着總多過於單個兒的女人寂寞的守着桌子。女人們的感情眞不可思議，簡直就如春蠶之自縛，吐出絲來，成了繭，又把自己裝在繭内，想到什麽地方本來是懷着滿腔熱趣。一到了地方不知怎的又歸於消失，而覺得失望，懊惱，以至於後悔跑出來。特别是在舞塲裏，女人們這樣，悲喜無常的嘴臉完全掩不了的擺到男人的眼前。</p>
<p>女人們的心到底是脆弱而本小了的。</p>

<p>殘酷的人們呵，你爲什麽用這樣可怕的手段來對付我們呢？你們天天咀咒我們，怨恨我們，不惜犧牲腦力來製造種種的機械來捕捉我們，似乎鼠類不滅絶不甘休似的。爲什麽亭樣呢？我們一樣的是動物，一樣的有血有肉的呵！</p>
<p>你們常常駡我們是混蛋，說我們不該咬壞房中的物件或偷吃了你們所貯藏着的食物，這似乎就是我們要被判决死刑的罪狀吧！但是我們也有不得巳的苦衷。爲什麽不讓我們有一些的辯護時間，而就加以殘酷的刑罰呢？</p>
<p>你總該相信吧，一個能維持自己生活的人是决不願做賊的，同時，解决生活問題是各種生物所俱有的天性。我們也是生物之一呵！我們知道饑餓，我們知道找尋食物來救濟我們的饑餓。這是天性，天性並非人力所能改造得了的。人能在饑餓的時候找東西吃，爲什麽我們不能呢？爲什麽我們爲了找食物就要受死刑的處分呢？</p>
<p>就說嚙壞東西一回事吧，我們也是不得巳而爲之的我們的牙齒長得很快，如果我們不嚙東西的話，幾天内就可使牙齒鑽出唇外的。爲了防止這種不幸的事件，我們當然不能不借嚙物來消磨牠的生長。這正和人們運用腦子一樣。假如你們不用腦子，腦子就要退化，爲了要使腦子發達，就不能不達用。這是自然的眞理，爲什麽你們就可適用眞理，而我們却爲了眞理受刑？</p>
<p>太不平等了，眞的，太不平等了！上帝創造了人類，不帝創造了我們，上帝並没有指明人類可以任意宰割我們。我們一樣的有存在的自由，地球是屬於所有的生物的：誰能說世界是人類單獨所佔有的？</p>

<p>寄韓諫議</p>
<p>我今不樂思岳陽　身欲奮飛病在床　美人娟娟隔秋水　濯足洞庭望八荒　鴻飛冥冥日月白　靑楓葉赤天雨霜　玉京羣帝集北斗　或騎麒麟翳鳳凰　芙蓉旌旗烟霧落　影動倒景搖瀟湘　星宮之君酣瓊漿　羽人稀少不在旁　似聞昨者赤松子　恐是漢代韓張子　昔隨劉氏定長安　惟幄未改神慘傷　國家成敗吾豈敢　色雖腥腐餐楓香　周南留滯古所惜　南極老信應壽昌　美人胡爲隔秋水　焉得置之貢玉堂</p>
<p>古柏行　杜甫</p>
<p>孔孔明廟前有老柏　柯如靑銅根如石　霜皮溜雨四十圍　黛色參天二千尺　雲來氣接巫峽長　月出寒通雪山白　君臣巳與時際會　樹木猶爲人愛惜　憶昨路繞錦亭東　先主武侯同閟宮　崔嵬枝幹郊原古　窈窕丹靑户牖空　落落盤踞雖得地　冥冥孤高多烈風　扶持自是神明力　正直元因造化功　大厦如傾要梁棟　黄牛迥首邱山重　不露文章世巳驚　未辭剪伐誰能送　苦心豈免容螻蟻　香葉終輕宿鸞鳳　志士幽人莫怨嗟　古來材大難爲用</p>

<p>Amidst Dense Clouds</p>
<p>Planes Attack the Capital Twice</p>
<p>Major Air Defense Drill Officially Begins Yesterday</p>
<p>The Entire City Hears Alarms and Traffic Stops</p>
<p>Dozens of Planes Engage in Fierce Battles in the Sky</p>
<p>Evening Drill Includes Blackout Regulations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital's air defense drill began on the morning of the 21st amidst dense clouds. At 8:00 AM, a certain observation post reported that over twenty enemy planes were flying towards the capital from a certain direction. At 8:10 AM, the capital's alarm system issued an air raid alert, with sirens and alarms sounding simultaneously. Those participating in the exercise included rescue, police, Boy Scouts, jointly forming a rescue, security, public works, disinfection, fire control, traffic control teams, all of whom were dispatched. Our side's anti-aircraft guns and aircraft teams were also prepared, standing by, and maintaining strict vigilance. Shortly thereafter, a certain observation post reported that enemy aircraft were approaching the capital. The alarm system issued an emergency alarm at 8:30 AM, and all city traffic was cut off, as if in wartime. Our air defense forces urgently dispatched more than twenty fighter planes to fly towards the enemy. They encountered the enemy planes in the high skies near the capital. Our planes used machine guns to fiercely strafe the enemy planes. After more than ten minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy planes were unable to withstand it and fled in disarray. The capital then turned from danger to safety. The alarm system announced the enemy aircraft's defeat and issued an all-clear signal at 9:00 AM, and the capital city returned to normal. When dozens of planes practiced aerial combat, two air force officers observed the battle from a judgment plane and were extremely satisfied with the superior combat techniques and courageous spirit of our planes. Also, during the exercise, the alarm system reported the exercise situation via radio broadcast by Huang Zhenqiu. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital's air defense drill continued on the afternoon of the 21st. At a little after 2:00 PM, hypothetical enemy planes launched a second attack on the capital from two directions, with fierce momentum. An air raid alert was issued, and the exercise units were dispatched, the situation being the same as in the morning. This time, the enemy planes moved swiftly, and a certain observation unit of ours failed to detect them early, causing them to approach the capital's airspace. Fortunately, our planes were prepared and immediately flew out to meet the attack. After a long and fierce battle, the enemy planes stubbornly resisted and fired flares. At a little after 3:00 PM, the alarm system issued an emergency alert. The smoke screen team released smoke screens in the northern corner of the city. For a time, white smoke densely covered important institutions and buildings, and the enemy planes were unable to obtain attack targets. In addition to releasing smoke screens, our side also ordered anti-aircraft guns on a certain high ground to bombard the enemy with blank shells. One enemy plane was hypothetically shot down by us, falling in a leaf-like manner. Other enemy planes were also repelled. The alarm system then issued an all-clear signal, already after 4:00 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital's air defense drill on the evening of the 21st included blackout regulations and other actions. At 7:30 PM, a hypothetical team of enemy planes attacked the capital. The alarm system issued an air raid alert, and the security, rescue, and anti-aircraft gun teams were dispatched simultaneously, with strict precautions. At 8:30 PM, the alarm system issued an even more urgent alert, with sirens and alarms sounding simultaneously. The capital's power plant implemented blackout regulations, turning off all city streetlights and cutting off traffic. The lights inside various institutions, organizations, and residents' homes were also covered with black paper. The wharves at Xiaguan and Pukou stations and the bustling streets, such as Fuzimiao and Taiping Road, were completely dark and silent. Only a few lights remained on the ships docked at the riverbank. Shortly thereafter, a team of enemy planes flew to the capital's airspace and dropped more than twenty bombs and signal flares. Our searchlights closely followed and illuminated the enemy planes, and the entire fuselage was reflected in our eyes. The anti-aircraft gun teams also aimed and fired, firing more than ten blank shells. The booming sound shook the entire city. The enemy planes were unable to withstand it and fled. The alarm system then issued an all-clear signal. At 9:40 PM, a second blackout was held, and the exercise situation was the same as before. At 10:15 PM, the all-clear signal was issued, and the capital city reappeared in light. A Central News Agency reporter patrolled the streets during the exercise and found that the blackout regulations were much more advanced than during the rehearsal. In particular, rickshaw pullers extinguished their car lights after the emergency alert was issued and stood upright on the side of the street, with orderly discipline. In addition, the anti-aircraft guns and searchlights operated quickly. Once the enemy planes were discovered, they could not escape after being fired upon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to take into account the possibility of enemy party spies taking advantage of the opportunity to riot and disrupt public order during enemy air raids in international warfare, the Beijing garrison held riot suppression exercises at the same time during the air defense exercise. It is reported that at 4:00 AM on the 22nd, riot suppression exercises were held, at 10:00 AM, exercises were held to suppress outdoor gatherings and parades, and at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, exercises were held for indoor arrests.

<p>Yuan Liang Talks About</p>
<p>The Issue of Expanding the Urban Area</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Already Drafted Three Plans</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Liang talked about the issue of expanding the urban area. The Municipal Government has appointed representatives Wu Chengshi and Tan Wuxun, assistants Duan Yuling and Wei Yezhen, and the Provincial Government representatives are Zhang Lisheng and Zhang Houwan, assistant Fu Weiji. The internal commissioners are Huang Zupei and Wu Shizhong. After Huang and others arrived in Ping, the representatives of the three parties held a meeting once, but formal discussions will have to wait until Zhang Lisheng and others take office in Ping on the 25th of this month before they can be held. The Municipal Government has now drafted three plans for the expansion of the urban area: (1) The city of Ping is to be transformed into a cultural and tourist area, striving to achieve this in the short term. (2) The city's rivers and canals must be improved and dredged. (3) Construct ditches and canals. The total cost of these three plans is estimated to be more than 7 million yuan. Since it is not easy to raise the money at one time, more than 3 million yuan will be used to build the cultural and tourist area first. If it is not enough, Kong has agreed that the Ministry of Finance will help as much as possible. After the urban area is expanded, there will not be enough police in the four suburbs, so it is planned to immediately implement the Baojia system to seek local autonomy and construction through the power of the people. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government believes that the expansion of the city of Ping to Nawan, Mentougou, Tangshan, and Linhe, including the entire territory of Wanping and Daxing counties, and one-third of the territory of Changping and Tongxian counties, is even more related to the provincial revenue and the county system. Therefore, it has ordered Civil Affairs Director Zhang Houwan and Construction Director Zhang Lisheng to go to Ping with Civil Affairs Secretary Chief Fu Weiji and Real Affairs Secretary Chief Huang Zengyuan on the 25th to jointly discuss with Yuan Liang and Interior Ministry commissioners Huang Zupei and Wu Shizhong and conduct on-site surveys. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Military Pay in North China</p>
<p>Hebei and Chahar Reduce Exemption Agreements</p>
<p>(Beiping) The full committee of the Military Branch Council previously telegraphed Chiang, asking him to urge He to come to Ping as soon as possible. Today, they received Chiang's reply, which roughly stated that He is currently handling military and political affairs and will urge He to return north as soon as he has finished handling them. The military pay in North China was previously assisted by the Hebei Provincial Government with 200,000 yuan per month, the Chahar Provincial Government with 120,000 yuan, Tianjin City with 60,000 yuan, and Ping City with 50,000 yuan. Recently, due to the financial difficulties of the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar, after negotiations with Kong Xiangxi who came north, it was decided that from November, the Hebei Provincial Government would assist with 120,000 yuan per month, and the remaining 100,000 yuan would be allocated by the Ministry of Finance. The Chahar Provincial Government will stop paying 120,000 yuan per month from November. In the future, the central tax revenue of Chahar Province will be directly remitted to the Ministry of Finance. The Chahar Provincial Government originally undertook to assist with the military pay, which will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the Military Branch Council. Tianjin City's 60,000 yuan for military pay will be allocated as usual by the Ministry of Finance to the Military Branch Council. Ping City's 50,000 yuan for military pay has not been allocated as usual, and the Military Branch Council has sent a letter urging them to allocate it as usual. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>The Pseudo-Regime Requests Revision</p>
<p>Of The Measures For The Custody of The Eastern Mausoleum</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The pseudo-regime does not quite agree with the measures of the Malanyu Eastern Mausoleum Custody Committee and requests a revision. The Japanese side relayed this matter to us. We believe that the Custody Committee has not been established and the Eastern Mausoleum has not actually been returned to our custody, so there is no need to study the pseudo-regime's request and we have rejected it.

<p>Recent Situation In Tibet</p>
<p>Talk By A Member Of Huang Musong's Entourage</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Weisong, a member of Huang Musong's entourage, said that he took a plane to Chengdu on April 26 and entered Tibet by land via the Sichuan border. He arrived in Lhasa on June 12. Huang's special envoy arrived in Lhasa on August 19. The Tibetan people welcomed him greatly outside the city because the central government had not had a high-ranking official enter Tibet for a long time. Huang's special envoy visited the Tibetan authorities to discuss everything and held a memorial service for the Dalai Lama. The date of Huang's return to Beijing has not been decided, and Tibet is very far away from here. In the past, the political situation was not very connected. The central government also hopes that Commissioner Huang will stay longer to persuade all parties and enable future communication and cooperation between Han and Tibet. I was ordered to return to Beijing first. Although the Kang Tibetan affairs have come to an end, both sides are still stationed on both sides of the Jinsha River. The Tibetan people hope that both sides will withdraw their troops as soon as possible. Before the Dalai Lama passed away, there were few imports of foreign goods, but recently Japanese goods have been the most. Nepalese are the most numerous merchants, and there are also dozens of merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Beiping, except for three or four large shops, the rest are small businesses. In recent years, Tibet has used Sichuan copper coins made in Daqianlu, weighing three coins and six weights, in the east, and Indian rupees in the west. Now, one central silver dollar can be exchanged for four taels of local silver, and one Indian rupee can be exchanged for eight taels and eight cents of silver. There are no schools in Tibet and no education. Only lamas are literate, because all lamas must chant scriptures, so they have the opportunity to be literate, but they are all in Tibetan. There is no one who knows Chinese or Chinese. The common people do not even know Tibetan. The three major monasteries are Baipeng Monastery, Xuela Monastery, and Gadan Monastery. There are now two factions in Tibet, the reformist and pro-British factions, and it is quite difficult to implement government measures. The Tibetan military is equipped with two officers, a "commander" and a "Major", under whom there are thirteen (Dai Ben), each Dai Ben being about a battalion. Each soldier is paid three dou of Artemisia annua, but no salary. They are over 30 years old and have no regular classes, similar to the Qing banner camp. The guns are all made in India. In addition, there are many militia. The total population of Tibet is estimated to be less than one million. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>The Lhasa Radio Station</p>
<p>Will Be Opened For Commercial Use</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications believes that communications between Lhasa and the mainland have always been relayed through India, which is very slow. When Huang Musong was dispatched to Tibet this spring, the Ministry of Communications installed a 100-watt radio station in Lhasa, which was completed in September and communicates directly with the Kangding and Ganzi stations. So far, it has been used exclusively by Huang. Now that Huang is about to return east, the Ministry of Communications plans to open the radio station for commercial use.

<p>Opium Dregs</p>
<p>Are Allowed For International Trade</p>
<p>The Siamese Proposal Was Rejected By The Advisory Committee</p>
<p>Japan And Two Other Countries Abstained</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Opium Advisory Committee discussed the Siamese proposal to allow the import and export of opium dregs today. The debate was extremely fierce and was finally rejected by a vote of fourteen to one. However, Japan and two other countries abstained. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Opium Advisory Committee met this morning to discuss the Siamese government's proposal to legalize the import and export of opium dregs. The Siamese representative said that the proposal was made by the Siamese government alone, stating that the amount of these dregs destroyed each year is extremely large, and there is now a need to use these dregs to manufacture morphine. Siam hopes to transport these dregs to various manufacturing countries, otherwise it will have to establish a morphine manufacturing plant in the country, but it requires a large amount of money. After the Siamese representative finished speaking, he asked the committee for its opinion. Then, the US representative, Mr. Fuller, stood up in a strong tone and said that according to the Hague Convention of 1912, opium dregs must never be imported or exported. The purpose of the Siamese government's proposal is only to seek greater profits than the dregs monopoly. The purpose of the Hague Convention is to gradually prohibit the manufacture, crack down on domestic sales and smoking of cooked opium, and prohibit the international sale of opium dregs. If the use of this sale is allowed, the public sale of opium will continue to exist, and the complete realization of the purpose of the convention will be delayed. The only reason put forward by the Siamese government is to obtain tax revenue. In fact, the secret sale and the public sale are equally harmful to the people. Therefore, the benefits obtained from the public sale must not be increased, and the committee cannot encourage such benefits. Therefore, the US government absolutely opposes this proposal. Moreover, according to US law, the import of opium dregs is prohibited. When the convention was signed, opium-producing countries such as India, Turkey, Persia, Yugoslavia, etc. made great sacrifices. Now, the monopoly countries are using dregs to manufacture morphine to compete with raw opium, which is unfair to the producing countries. Finally, Mr. Fuller emphatically stated that the Siamese government's proposal is a gradual way to "abuse narcotics and poison the world" and sincerely hopes that all parties will pay attention to it. Geneva believes that the Siamese government's proposal has the support of the British and Japanese governments. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>The London Times</p>
<p>Praises Our Construction Undertakings</p>
<p>(London) The London Times praised the Chinese government's attention to building roads, revitalizing water conservancy, and public health, recognizing this as a very promising point for China today. It also said that the remarks made by Mr. Meilehe, the Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs, yesterday should correct some false impressions. The newspaper also said that China has a vast territory and difficult transportation, so it will not be possible for Nanjing to extend its power to the outer provinces in a short period of time. Now Nanjing apparently believes that the best policy is to establish order and revitalize industry and commerce in the Yangtze River basin, where its power can reach, and to avoid actions that oppress the outer provinces. Those who study the disturbances in their own country in the Middle Ages, observe Chinese events with patience, and feel excited that Nanjing is now following the right path.

<p>Extending to Infinity</p>
<p>Report from the American Expedition</p>
<p>The American Navy Rear Admiral Byrd-led Antarctic expedition’s radio report from Little America in Antarctica states that the expedition’s pilot, Harold June, recently explored by plane and discovered a large plateau that extends from the Iceford Mountains in the southeast direction to infinity, and is connected to the newly discovered Marie Byrd Land. According to previous rumors, Marie Byrd Land and the Iceford Iceberg extending over the land were a cluster of islands. This new discovery completely refutes the previous claim. Furthermore, this aerial exploration lasted for slightly less than eight hours, covering an area of 77,694 square kilometers on the new land. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Declares to Parliament</p>
<p>Strengthening National Defense is Purely for Self-Defense</p>
<p>Unwavering in Commitment to Peaceful Efforts</p>
<p>Report on Indian Constitutional Reform Published</p>
<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons debated the King's Speech. Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the political situation abroad is extremely critical and need not be elaborated upon, so Britain must continue to strive to maintain world peace. MacDonald said, "The most important issue facing our country now is foreign relations. The confidence of various countries in the world has not increased in the past eighteen months. Therefore, we advocate continuing cooperation in Geneva, not only to show that we are a government that adheres to pacifism, but also to promote the greatest interests of our country." (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons discussion on the King's Declaration today, Labour Party leader Ramsay MacDonald delivered a speech stating, "The purpose of international discussions on various conventions is to oppose Germany. Germany is a great power. Since the European War, we have arbitrarily trampled on it. No country has been more devastated than Germany. Yet today, we are all fearful of Germany, deeply afraid of its actions." MacDonald's words are sufficient to prove that there are still people in Britain who recognize Germany as "a victim of the Treaty of Versailles." MacDonald also said, "The reason why the European situation is as it is today is largely due to the peace treaties after the European War. Now France, Germany, and even our country are constantly increasing armaments. Who are they defending against? I don't know. Can't these countries stop armaments and let their politicians use common sense to find a solution?" The Prime Minister, according to custom, answered the first question raised, but his declaration was very vague, and finally explained the rationale for Britain's strengthening of national defense. MacDonald also said that the British government advocates cooperating fully with the League of Nations, and will find ways to bring countries closer together whenever possible. Regarding the issue of disarmament, MacDonald said, "None of Britain's armaments are offensive or aggressive. We have proven this to the world, and none of the representatives of various countries in Geneva can deny it. Even if we strengthen armaments due to national defense needs, people in the world will never accuse Britain of wanting to increase its offensive military power to oppress unarmed countries. This is what I dare to say. Our intentions will be clearly expressed in the next military budget." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The report of the Joint Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform, the content of which was eagerly awaited by the general public, was published this afternoon. This move represents the most arduous work in the history of the British Empire or the world regarding the study and revision of constitutions, and it has now been completed. The report advocates replacing the current centralized government system with a federal system for all of India, including autonomous units. The eleven provinces of India under British rule (two of which will be newly created) and the princely states of India will form a federal system. The princely states will join the federation voluntarily. The internal administrative system of the princely states and the relationship between the monarchs and monarchs outside the scope of the federation will not be changed. However, each province should expand the scope of its governance of its own affairs compared to the present. The majority of the administrative departments involving individuals, including law, order, and certain types of tax revenues and local taxes, will be the affairs to be handled by the provinces. The federal government will handle matters related to the entire Indian nation, such as currency and tax rules. Defense and foreign affairs will still be the direct responsibility of the Governor-General of India. Each province will have a legislative assembly, elected directly by voters. Voters account for about 14 percent of the population. Five of these provinces have upper and lower houses. The federal government has upper and lower houses, composed of those indirectly elected by the provinces and those appointed by the princely states. The parliaments of the federation and the provinces all stipulate seats for various ethnic minorities. The administrators of the federal and provincial governments are responsible to the parliament, the same as the British cabinet's system of responsibility to the parliament.

<p>Handling the Chaco Dispute</p>
<p>League of Nations Special Assembly Convenes</p>
<p>Mediation Committee Recommends</p>
<p>Paraguay Refuses to Accept</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly convened an extraordinary session to handle the Chaco dispute. The meeting opened today, chaired by Czech representative Benes, Chairman of the Administrative Council. Benes delivered the opening speech, first paying tribute to the late King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou. After a two-minute silence, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtic thanked the League of Nations on behalf of the Yugoslav government, saying that the Marseille murder case affected international organizations (referring to the League of Nations) because both Alexander I and the late French Foreign Minister Barthou were enthusiastic defenders. French Foreign Minister Laval then spoke after Jevtic, praising the late monarch of Yugoslavia, saying that he was a great leader who "died on the battlefield of peace," and also said that he (Laval referring to himself) would strive to follow in Barthou's footsteps in order to complete his unfinished business.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations extraordinary session for handling the Chaco dispute held its second meeting this morning. Discussions have already begun on the report and recommendations made by the Chaco Affairs Committee, chaired by Czech Ambassador to France Osusky. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro The Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly handling the Chaco dispute recommends resolving the dispute through mediation and arbitration. Prior to this, (1) military action should be stopped immediately, and the troops of both sides should remain on their existing front lines; (2) both sides should demobilize within a short period of time; (3) a demilitarized zone should be established; (4) the areas currently occupied by the belligerent countries should be maintained by the police. The above recommendations have been rejected by Paraguay. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro Paraguay replied to the League of Nations today, rejecting the League of Nations' proposal to end the Chaco War, but suggested starting with a ceasefire, disarmament, and security plan, and then resolving the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay through reconciliation and arbitration. Although Paraguay's reply has not closed the door to negotiations, the League of Nations, which previously regarded the investigation committee's report as acceptable to both sides, so as to promote an early peace, is now greatly disappointed. If Bolivia accepts the League of Nations' proposal, Bolivia will be in an obviously advantageous position, because although the League of Nations' report approves the actions of some member states of the League of Nations in not allowing arms to be shipped into the belligerent countries, it advocates that if one of the belligerent countries accepts the League of Nations General Assembly's proposal and the other party does not accept it, then the country that has accepted the proposal can be exempted from the ban on arms supplies.

<p>Saar Three-Person Committee</p>
<p>Negotiations Gradually Showing a Glimmer of Hope</p>
<p>Germany Agrees to Send Experts to Participate in Discussions</p>
<p>Rome Negotiations on the Saar issue have gradually shown a glimmer of hope today, and practical results are expected. The Saar Region Plebiscite Three-Person Committee, chaired by Italian Baron Aloisi, suspended its work a few days ago so that German experts could consult with their government on everything. The Three-Person Committee has reconvened this morning. The general public believes that from today, the negotiations seem to have entered another stage, which is expected to be successful, because the German experts have received instructions from the government to allow them to begin substantive discussions on the various issues pointed out in the French government's memorandum of August 31. The Three-Person Committee will now meet in the evening. (According to the French government's memorandum submitted to the League of Nations on August 31 regarding the Saar issue, it made recommendations on the political system after the results of the Saar plebiscite were determined, as well as the economic, financial, and debt handling methods.)

<p>(Berlin) According to today's news, the German authorities are now earnestly trying to prevent irresponsible actions on the German border during the Saar plebiscite.

It is reported that the German authorities are carefully selecting a number of Brown Shirt stormtroopers for special inspection purposes. These people will be deployed on a defensive line in the 25-mile area along the border to prevent fanatics from engaging in foolish and outrageous behavior. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Announces Again</p>
<p>The Truth About the Stalemate in the Sino-Eastern Railway Negotiations</p>
<p>Japan Considers the Guarantee of Payment as an Insult</p>
<p>Opposes Submitting Disputes to Arbitration</p>
<p>(Moscow) Although there was a detailed report from TASS on October 31 regarding the truth about the Sino-Eastern Railway sale negotiations, at present, the Japanese and Manchurian newspapers are still reporting inaccurately on the progress of the negotiations. At the same time, internationally, it is generally believed that since the issue of the selling price has been resolved, what other selling conditions can delay the signing of the final agreement, which is strange. Therefore, TASS has collected other news about the truth of the negotiations from reliable sources in order to clarify the real cause of this delay.</p>
<p>Regarding certain selling conditions of the Sino-Eastern Railway, the Japanese side has been quite insistent on some of the Soviet Union's natural demands and is unwilling to agree, such as the reasonable demand for a guarantee of the funds allocated by the Soviet side, which is most obvious. This method is intended to erase the form of the "Manchukuo" debt guaranteed by the Japanese side. Unfortunately, since TASS published a detailed report on October 31, Japan has not changed its attitude on this important issue. The Soviet side believes that this is purely a commercial matter, while Japan has proposed the principle of "trust" in "Manchukuo" and is willing to assume the responsibility of "mediation" if "Manchukuo" has difficulties in payment. Not only that, but the Japanese side (especially the Japanese and Manchurian press) also regards the Soviet Union's demands as "distrust" of Japan and Manchukuo, and almost as an insult to Japan and Manchukuo. This has greatly surprised Moscow. They believe that when concluding such business, the use of a guarantee system is universally recognized. As for the current incident, this huge economic enterprise is sold by installments, and at the same time, the sovereignty of the railway will be transferred to the new owner from the time the agreement is signed. In such a situation, the customary requirement for a guarantee is natural. As for the issue of "distrust," it is even more absurd, because if the Soviet side does not trust the effectiveness of the Japanese guarantee, or does not affirm that Japan will never allow the debts guaranteed by the Japanese side to be defaulted on for its own benefit, then it will never ask Japan to provide a guarantee. The Soviet Union does so precisely because it assumes that the Japanese guarantee will ensure that the agreement can be implemented as usual.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to consolidate the normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, it should be predicted that future disputes arising from the implementation of the sale agreement will not become the root cause of new conflicts between the two countries. In order to achieve this goal, the Soviet side has requested the establishment of arbitration in order to resolve future differences that may arise in the calculation of freight or road funds. At the same time, if impartial arbitrators cannot be determined, the Soviet Union suggests that these arbitrators should be appointed by foreign chambers of commerce with international prestige (such as the chambers of commerce of the United Kingdom and the United States). The name of this chamber of commerce should be noted in the agreement.</p>
<p>This issue is extremely important, because the Soviet Union allows the Japanese and Manchurian sides to use goods to pay two-thirds of the road price. At the same time, in order to satisfy the wishes of the Japanese side, the Soviet Union has agreed to expand the types of goods to include textiles, silk, tea, soybeans, rice, and other goods in addition to industrial machinery. However, the Japanese side has expressed opposition to the participation of foreign arbitrators. They suggested that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Commerce should appoint a person as the arbitrator. This suggestion was rejected because Japan cannot act as a completely unrelated "third party" in future disputes between the Soviet Union and Manchuria. Moreover, Japan is using this arbitration principle to resolve its economic disputes with other countries. For example, it is a signatory to the International Commercial Arbitration Agreement. Therefore, Japan's refusal to accept arbitration methods to resolve possible disputes between the Soviet Union and Manchuria is even more puzzling. The persistent attitude expressed by the Japanese side on the above issues is also attracting Moscow's attention, because in the notes addressed to Hirota by Yurenev on October 30, October 31, and November 6, the Soviet government made great concessions on other points of contention. We cannot point out all the important issues one by one here, but one thing that must be mentioned here is that the Japanese side has repeatedly canceled the points that were originally agreed upon, which has made it difficult for the negotiations to proceed. For example, on July 23, both parties agreed that once the negotiations were concluded, the retirement pay and support fees for the Sino-Eastern Railway employees would be allocated immediately. However, recently the Japanese suddenly announced that there was no such agreement before. The authorities here are most attentive to the fact that the attitudes of the Soviet and Japanese sides regarding the content of their respective wishes during the negotiations are very different. On the Soviet side, the following goals have been pursued: The Sino-Eastern Railway sale agreement, on the one hand, wants to permanently eliminate the possibility of using the Sino-Eastern Railway issue to make Soviet-Japanese relations tense, and at the same time, it must include guarantees to promote its smooth realization, thereby consolidating the political and economic relations between the two countries, which is conducive to world peace. Some of the suggestions from the Japanese side are the opposite. If these suggestions are adopted into the agreement, people will still be able to use the Sino-Eastern Railway issue as a source of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union even after the sale of the Sino-Eastern Railway. This agreement was originally a tool for peace, but some Japanese can turn it into a weapon for future conflicts. Therefore, well-informed sources in the Soviet Union believe that the hope of giving this agreement the above-mentioned nature is in line with the interests of some Japanese people. If this is the case, then this agreement will be in obvious conflict with the good neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, so it will be incompatible with general peace. Therefore, the Soviet side sincerely hopes that the Japanese government can prove its good intentions and allow these negotiations to be completed satisfactorily, because this may not be a blessing for the Japanese.

<p>Tense Cabinet Meeting in Japan</p>
<p>Discussing Budget Issues</p>
<p>Ministers of the Army and Navy Insist on Increasing Military Spending</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Second Budget Cabinet Meeting was convened at the Prime Minister's residence at 1:40 PM on the 21st. First, Finance Minister Fujii reported on the outline of the Ministry of Finance's review of the supplementary requests from various ministries, stating that the total amount had reached 320 million yen, and the issuance of public bonds was limited. Not only must the market's ability to absorb be considered, but it must also be reviewed according to the policy of gradually reducing deficit public bonds. The total amount must not exceed 41 million yen. Various ministries have expressed dissatisfaction with this, but here we can only ask for understanding of the financial authorities' difficulties and to bear what must be borne. The military departments are the most dissatisfied with this review of supplementary requests, especially Army Minister Hayashi, who claimed that the Manchurian Incident has not yet normalized. At this critical international period of 1935-36, the military administration should make national defense preparation its necessity. Even if we understand the difficulties of the Ministry of Finance, this review cannot be recognized, and we hope to reconsider it. The Army Minister insisted on adding supplementary requests without any reduction with an extremely strong attitude, so the cabinet meeting became tense. Next, Navy Minister Osumi spoke, saying that the London Preparatory Disarmament Conference is still in progress, and the Navy believes that it is at a critical period, so this Ministry of Finance review cannot be recognized. The two ministers of the Army and Navy did not mention any figures, but took the recognition of the current situation as their starting point and expressed their unwillingness to compromise on the initial supplementary request. At this time, Finance Minister Fujii explained the current financial situation and repeatedly stated the aforementioned remarks, hoping that the military departments would retreat. Next, Interior Minister Goto requested additional funding for the current situation relief fund and disaster countermeasures budget. Education Minister Matsuda said that elementary schools are lacking food, and children's food expenses must be requested. Agriculture Minister Yamazaki also needed to add expenses for rural relief and rural revitalization. All ministers presented realistic situations and necessities, forcing the Finance Minister to repeat the reasons for the various reviews, and then Railways Minister Tokonami asked whether there was any room for easing the issuance of public bonds. The Finance Minister said that he would present his opinions on the tax increase plan in a short while, and then explained the limits of issuing public bonds based on the survey data. At this point, the cabinet meeting temporarily adjourned at 6:00 PM. After dinner, the meeting continued from 7:00 PM. (21st Japan Federation Electric)</p>

<p>American Financial Group</p>
<p>Conspiracy to Overthrow the American Government Exposed</p>
<p>Attempting to Buy 500,000 Veterans with Three Million Dollars</p>
<p>Forming a New Army to March on Washington to Establish a Fascist Dictatorship</p>
<p>(New York) The Congressional Committee Investigating Anti-American Activities today discovered a conspiracy by Wall Street leaders to fund the overthrow of the current government with three million dollars and install General Smedley Butler as a fascist dictator. Butler, a retired Marine Corps officer, reported to the investigation committee today as an important witness that he refused to form an army of 500,000 European War veterans and march on Washington. Congressman Dickstein, the vice chairman of the committee, stated that Butler's statement was consistent with other evidence obtained by the committee's investigators. Dickstein told the Associated Press that in the current situation, Butler's claims are indeed true. The committee has been investigating for several weeks and has obtained evidence that several prominent figures harbor anti-American ideologies. According to Butler, many Wall Street leaders are involved in this conspiracy. The famous financier Grayson Murphy, who has repeatedly performed military exploits, was also identified by Butler as one of those involved. Murphy was furious upon hearing this and denounced it as nonsense, while Wall Street securities salesman Maguire also testified that he had never contacted Butler on behalf of New York's wealthy businessmen.

Other items such as land deeds will be appropriately increased. As for the penalty section, the opinions presented by the Ministry of Finance are considered acceptable, and it is planned to impose a fine of five yuan for those with a fine of less than five yuan.

<h3 id="e6">What Is Hoped For From the Central Rural Service Training Institute <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>By Ji</p>
<p>Recently, the Executive Yuan of the National Government held its 185th regular meeting. A resolution was made to establish a Central Rural Service Training Institute. It is planned to enroll an initial class of two to three hundred students. Eligibility is limited to university graduates. After being admitted, students will attend lectures at the institute for six months, and then be assigned to various experimental counties for a year of practical training, as an aid to promoting rural education. Such is the rough outline of the training institute's content. Its detailed plan and budget, however, must be approved by the Central Political Council before it can be established.</p>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture. The majority of the nation's production comes from rural areas. It is not inappropriate to say that agriculture is the lifeblood of the nation. Therefore, if we want to talk about revitalizing the country and benefiting the people today, the most important plan is to improve agriculture and increase production. Only then will the nation's finances and people's livelihoods have the possibility of abundance. Our farmers stubbornly adhere to ancient methods. The simplicity of cultivation techniques and the degradation of both the quality and quantity of agricultural products prevent us from competing with advanced agricultural nations. This can be clearly seen in the annual surge in agricultural product imports. The depletion of national financial resources and the distress of the people's livelihoods are largely due to this. Many people advocate reclaiming wasteland and colonizing border areas. However, few have been seen who can truly implement relief and develop mature rural areas. As a result, ordinary farmers cannot maintain their fields and homes, and seek opportunities elsewhere, abandoning their land and not cultivating it, forming a nationwide phenomenon of declining agriculture. Although there are many ways to relieve rural areas, raising farmers' knowledge and promoting new planting methods are essential. In the past thirty years, those engaged in new education have known the importance of agricultural education, but few have personally promoted it. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), students in secondary vocational schools nationwide accounted for only a little over 6.7 percent, and agricultural students accounted for only a small portion of that. As for students in specialized schools and above in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), those studying agriculture and forestry accounted for only 3.2 percent of the total. This is the smallest number among all disciplines. However, from these fragmented statistics, it can be imagined that the number of people with scientific agricultural knowledge in the country is as rare as morning stars. In a country founded on agriculture, if agricultural education is so underdeveloped, can the economic future of the entire country be fortunate? Therefore, the urgent need to promote agricultural education in the future is a matter of course. The Executive Yuan's proposal to establish the Central Rural Service Training Institute is motivated by this, without a doubt. Although the establishment of the institute is still pending, the timeframe should not be far off. We not only optimistically look forward to its success, but also hope that it will be pragmatic and achieve results as soon as possible, and in a short period of time, become a major base for promoting rural education in experimental counties across the country.</p>
<p>What do we mean by being pragmatic? The small number of agricultural talents that our country has often do not use what they have learned. After completing their studies, they do not set foot in the fields, nor do they personally engage with beans and wheat. They only associate with the scholar-official class. Few of them can deeply engage with rural areas, change customs, engage in planting and cultivation, and serve as role models for farmers. Although their education focuses on production, they themselves do not participate in production. As a result, how can their impact on the production sector not be minimal? Since the government has high expectations for the Central Rural Service Training Institute, it should not merely be a way to find employment for a few university graduates, or a place for even fewer teaching staff to earn a living. It is conceivable that our earnest prayer for the establishment of the training institute lies in cultivating technical talents who deeply engage with rural areas, and absolutely preventing both staff and students from contracting the bad habits of the scholar-official class. Then, the benefits to rural education in various experimental counties will not be insignificant.</p>
<p>Serious Internal Strife in Austria</p>
<p>One Faction Shouts "Heimwehr Forever"</p>
<p>Another Faction Shouts "Schuschnigg Forever"</p>
<p>Large-Scale Police Suppression of Mutual Fighting</p>
<p>Innsbruck – The "Austrian Patriotic Front" is the only bulwark for the Austrian government to resist the Social Democratic Party and the National Socialist Party within the country. Internal strife has now occurred. The situation in Tyrol has been tense for the past few weeks. Today, the paramilitary group belonging to Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg and the Home Guard had a serious conflict. The Home Guard, led by Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg, suddenly shouted "Heimwehr Forever" at the supporters of the Chancellor to provoke them. The other side did not show weakness and shouted "Schuschnigg Forever." Thereupon, the Home Guard attacked and fought each other. Upon hearing the news, the authorities immediately dispatched a large number of police to the scene to suppress the situation. After much effort, the two factions were separated. Many people on both sides were injured, but none were seriously injured. The Home Guard threatened to retaliate, so armed police patrolled the entire city all day. Chancellor Schuschnigg, who had finished his talks with Mussolini in Rome, packed his bags and rushed back to his country upon hearing the news. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>U.S. War Debts</p>
<p>(Washington) – The Treasury Department today, as usual, notified the war debt debtor countries that the debts owed to the United States are due on December 15th, totaling $154,729,976, not including previous arrears. The countries notified by the Treasury Department are Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Finland, France, England, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. Among them, only Finland has not previously defaulted. It is said that the Treasury Department does not expect the defaulting countries to pay on time, but this notification can show that the United States still adheres to its consistent policy, that is, war debts must be paid. Finland, which has never defaulted, today requested the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue bonds worth $10 million in the United States to repay part of its foreign debt. Given Finland's consistent attitude towards the war debt issue, it is generally believed that the committee will likely approve this request. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Naval Negotiations Hanging by a Thread</p>
<p>Britain Tries to Make a Final Turnaround</p>
<p>Simon and Matsudaira Meet Again</p>
<p>British and American Plenary Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Talks Leading to Political Issues Rejected by Japan</p>
<p>U.S. Emphasizes the Survival of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty</p>
<p>(London) – This morning, the Cabinet Council considered the serious status of the naval talks. British Foreign Secretary Simon will hold another meeting with Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira to determine if there is a way to reconcile the attitudes of Japan, Britain, and the United States. At the same time, it was agreed this afternoon that representatives of the British and American sides would hold a plenary meeting on a selected date, approximately November 23rd. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>It is generally expected that President Roosevelt's reply to the British government will only involve cooperation between Britain and the United States to establish a new treaty. Britain and the United States will likely convene a meeting within a few months to lay the foundation for next summer's naval conference. At that time, France and Italy will be invited to participate. Next year's conference will definitely discuss multilateral treaties to replace the existing Washington Treaty. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) – Prime Minister MacDonald declared in the House of Commons today that he had hoped to report to the House on the current situation of the naval talks yesterday morning, but a new trend had emerged in the past twenty-four hours, and he intended to refrain from discussing it for the time being so that Parliament could hear the details after everything was completed. The House of Commons is currently engaged in debating the response to the King's address, which will take about five days to complete. Then, Foreign Secretary Simon will announce the progress of the naval talks in the House. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) – According to the opinions of members of the U.S. naval delegation, the naval talks are now over, with only handshakes and farewells remaining. It is heard that the Japanese and U.S. delegations will leave London in about a week or two. Today, the U.S. delegation stated that the United States does not want to discuss the clauses in the Washington Treaty on not setting up defensive works, because these clauses are only valuable if the original treaty exists. Thus, the last hope for a compromise in the naval talks was also dashed. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) – The situation of the naval talks may indirectly trigger all issues in the Far East. The Japanese representatives have repeatedly stated that even if the Washington Naval Treaty is declared abolished, the status quo of defensive works and naval bases in the Pacific, as stipulated in 1922, can still be maintained and should be maintained. The Japanese representatives have also repeatedly stated that the islands in the Pacific mandated to Japan for administration have not only not been fortified, but most of them cannot be equipped with defensive works. Chinese people in London have adopted a reserved and worried attitude towards this. They are deeply afraid that Japan is using secret means and said that the military equipment on the Pacific islands has been mentioned repeatedly, but Japan has not provided credible reasons for renewal. Chinese people also believe that the Washington Naval Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations Covenant, and all the clauses of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty are often regarded as waste paper, which is lamentable. As for the Americans, they say that the inability to set up defensive works on the Pacific mandated islands is stipulated by the mandate agreement and does not need to be discussed. The naval talks should continue on a technical level. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>The Theory of U.S.-Japan Equilibrium</p>
<p>Japan Seems to Have Made Such an Indication</p>
<p>(London) – Although the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denies the claim of a new Japanese proposal, the British delegation said at the fourth British-Japanese talks that Japan had advocated that "Britain has vast overseas territories, so it can recognize its possession of a high level of naval power, but it is necessary to possess the same naval power as the United States." However, Britain has, in principle, recognized the equal ratio of British and American naval power since 1922. If it agrees with the above-mentioned Japanese proposal, it will be contradictory and will fall into a difficult situation. (Dentsu, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Newspapers on November 19th carried the remarks of British Foreign Secretary Simon regarding the London Naval Talks. It was said that the British Foreign Secretary told reporters that Japan had adopted an attitude, thinking that Britain should build ships to a high level, and that the Japanese government did not see any reason why the U.S. Navy should be superior to the Japanese Navy. The British Foreign Secretary also said that the Japanese representatives had made it clear that even if Japan obtained naval equality, it would not want to build ships to the same level as Britain and the United States, but for the sake of face, Japan could never accept the 5:5:3 ratio again. This morning, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told foreign journalists that he did not believe that the British Foreign Secretary had made such remarks, because the delegations of various countries had an understanding that the content of the talks must be kept strictly confidential. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) – Colonel Iwashita of the Japanese delegation saw that the British authorities had published their views, saying that Japan's proposal for disarmament meant that the United States and Japan were equal and Britain was superior. In other words, it was the claim of an actual strength of 5:4:4, which caused a great uproar. Therefore, on the 20th, he issued the following statement to the foreign press corps, proposing that Britain could maintain a navy larger than Japan's. I have never heard the two plenipotentiaries Matsudaira and Yamamoto say this. Moreover, the preparatory meeting is still in its initial stage, and it is impossible to make a numerical proposal. This statement must be some kind of misunderstanding. (Dentsu, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) – Regarding the progress of the preparatory negotiations, various rumors have arisen here, and there is no consensus. It is said that Representative Matsudaira proposed a 5:4:4 ratio for the naval power of Britain, the United States, and Japan, and that he proposed to realize an equal annual plan with a limit of fifteen years. It is also widely rumored that Japan is advocating equilibrium with the United States and recognizing Japan's inferiority to Britain. Therefore, the Japanese delegation, the British government, and the U.S. delegation are all busy answering questions from the press corps, which is quite troublesome. (Nichi-Rengo, 21st)</p>
<p>Saito Makoto Writes</p>
<p>No Less Than a Warning to the Inside</p>
<p>Military Cliques Know Their Own Arrogance Very Well</p>
<p>Hoping for Some Achievement in the Naval Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) – The Christian Science Monitor today published an article by former Prime Minister Saito, attacking the aggression of Japan and other countries, saying that Japan will never have an aggressive policy. We must coexist in the world. If there is a warlike country, it will only increase the burden of various countries. He dared to say that the London Naval Conference must succeed in order to seek world peace. Anyone with proper thinking should know that a bankrupt naval competition cannot achieve anything. This trend will only make culture regress and foster hatred. People in the U.S. government have paid close attention to this article, but have not issued any criticism. At the same time, according to a report in the London Daily Telegraph, the U.S. side has notified the Japanese naval representatives that the U.S. government considers Article 19 of the Washington Treaty to be a major part of the treaty. If this treaty is no longer valid, then the clause regarding not placing defensive works in a certain location will naturally be invalid. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Boston – The Christian Science Monitor carried a conversation by former Japanese Prime Minister Saito, criticizing the Seiyukai for inciting Japan to oppose the extension of the naval treaty. Saito said that the Seiyukai was annoyed because Prime Minister Okada formed a cabinet and refused the manipulation of the majority party. It turned to support the Japanese military cliques. Saito was deeply concerned about the naval competition between Britain, the United States, and Japan, and believed that the Emperor could eventually subdue the military. He also said that he knew that the Emperor did not want Japan's navy to be unrestrained for a long time. Without the consent of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, the Emperor would not want to approve new plans to expand the navy and increase taxes. (Kokumin, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) – General Saito, the former Japanese Prime Minister, published an article in the Christian Science Weekly, attacking the arrogant patriots of Japan and other countries, and advocated that the naval countries should establish an agreement to limit the number of warships. General Saito's article is no different from a solemn warning to the people of his own country, and has aroused the warmest and most pleasant impression in London, because Saito is a veteran in Japanese political circles, has held the most important positions for many years, and these remarks will inevitably cause a major shock. This is not denied by people on the Japanese side. As for the British and American people, although they have a good impression, they still adopt a reserved attitude. Responsible persons declared that if Saito made the remarks, it would be tantamount to suicide, but Saito's moderate, clear, and courageous attitude has long been known to the world when he first served as Governor-General of Korea and later as Prime Minister of Japan, so listening to these remarks is not surprising. Japanese military figures are now in key positions, and Saito's proposition has no hope of success, but it is impossible for responsible Japanese politicians to be unmoved by such wise remarks. Not to mention that, as far as we know, Saito's remarks are in line with the sentiments of some people in the Emperor's court. Therefore, although Saito is not directly involved in the current naval negotiations, his remarks will have an important impact on the naval talks, or generate a new meaning, which is possible. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon</p>
<p>Mentioned Political Issues</p>
<p>Matsudaira Directly Refused to Discuss</p>
<p>(London) – At the meeting on the 19th, Foreign Secretary Simon proposed to Japanese Representative Matsudaira to discuss political issues and asked Japan and Britain to take the same steps to implement the Far East policy and the China policy. The intention of the British proposal seems to be to renew the Nine-Power and Four-Power Treaties to ensure the security of China's territory and the peace of the Pacific. Representative Matsudaira replied that the discussion of political issues might cause disputes in the talks, and Japan would find it difficult to accept this proposal. (Nichi-Rengo, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) – The content of the proposal made by Foreign Secretary Simon to the Japanese representatives on the 19th to ensure the peace of the Pacific is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Conclude a new treaty on China and the Pacific; (2) The new treaty guarantees the security of China's territory and confirms the maintenance of the freedom of North China; (3) Declare that when a naval building competition occurs, the political peace of the Pacific must be valued. (Nichi-Rengo, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) – The Japanese naval view has no possibility of being accepted by the United States, unless the Washington government fundamentally changes its attitude. The U.S. representatives are now asking the government for instructions. Before receiving instructions, they will continue to follow the original instructions and strongly oppose granting equal rights to Japan, regardless of how the equal rights are realized. Americans here believe that the Tokyo government's proposal for equal rights will eventually be formally rejected by the United States. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald</p>
<p>Postpones Reporting to the House of Commons</p>
<p>What Exactly Is the So-Called New Factor</p>
<p>(London) – Prime Minister MacDonald, when discussing the naval issue in the House of Commons this afternoon, said that he had originally intended to report to the House on the situation of the naval talks today, but a "new factor" had occurred yesterday, so he could not report it for the time being. What exactly does the Prime Minister mean by the so-called new factor? Perhaps the Japanese representatives have presented their views anew, or it is not yet known. At the Cabinet meeting tomorrow, Foreign Secretary Simon will review the results of the talks. Japanese people say that the naval equality requested by their country will be gradually realized over the years. The time limit needs to be negotiated. Japanese people also say that the naval talks should focus on the reduction of naval power, not on the increase. Therefore, what Japan advocates is not expanding the Japanese navy, but stipulating a common maximum amount. Any warships of Britain and the United States that exceed this maximum amount should be replaced. However, well-informed people in Britain answered the following points, namely (1) Up to now, Britain has not formally recognized the naval equality requested by Japan; (2) Britain can certainly agree to reduce the total tonnage of the British navy, but the number of warships cannot be reduced. (According to Britain's advocacy of a small-ship policy, the total tonnage can be reduced without reducing the number of ships.) British people have repeatedly stated that the number of warships set by the British Admiralty is essential for protecting British territory and maritime communications. For example, 15 armored ships, of which 6 are used for the European fleet, 6 are used for the Far East, and the remaining 3 are used for reserve, are all properly allocated and there is no excessive number. (According to the first naval preparatory talks this summer, the British representatives submitted the British naval plan to the U.S. representatives, which listed 15 armored ships and increased the number of cruisers from 40 to 70.) (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Japan's Strong Stance</p>
<p>Not Willing to Fall Behind in the Naval Building Competition</p>
<p>(London) – The spokesperson of the Japanese delegation, in view of rumors such as the U.S.-Japan equilibrium and British superiority theory and the introduction of the Pacific political issue theory, specifically stated to the press corps that Japan advocates realizing equal rights by setting a common maximum limit on possession, and a defense-oriented navy by reducing offensive weapons, and insists that it has nothing to do with political issues. Its statement is as follows:</p>
<p>We seek world naval power not for offensive purposes, so we advocate the reduction and abolition of battleships, aircraft carriers, and Class A cruisers, and the limited use of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Moreover, we must reduce the total possession of the entire fleet and jointly determine its maximum limit. If political issues are involved at that time, it will only complicate the meeting and will not help the matter. If the meeting breaks down, we are willing to avoid a naval building competition as much as possible, but if we are caught in an unconditional state and such a competition occurs, we are not willing to fall behind. (Dentsu, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) – This afternoon, Rear Admiral Yamamoto, the chief specialist of the Japanese delegation, declared to a representative of the British press, "If naval quantity restrictions cannot be stipulated on the basis of our proposal, then we cannot recognize any qualitative restrictions."

<p>Spain's Anti-Gas Preparations</p>
<p>Madrid – People here are now beginning to consider the possibility of defending against chemical warfare. A "Civil Protection School for Defense Against Chemical Warfare" has recently been established in the capital, and is presided over by an army major medical officer. In addition to theory, the course also includes practice in using anti-gas masks and respirators. 200 people in the capital have signed up for classes, with men and women each accounting for about half.

<p>U.S. Navy Secretary Orders</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting the Disclosure of Naval Secrets</p>
<p>The U.S. Is Often at a Disadvantage in Exchanging Information</p>
<p>Using This to Prevent Semi-Official Espionage Activities</p>
<p>(Washington) – Secretary of the Navy Swanson recently signed multiple orders, strictly prohibiting the disclosure of national defense information and preventing semi-official espionage activities. According to the Navy Department, there is currently a certain naval country that is unwilling to exchange information about the navy with the United States, saying that the internal affairs of the U.S. Navy can be known without going through the U.S. government, and there is no need to obtain it through exchange procedures. Now, when the London Naval Negotiations are underway, this situation will put the United States at a disadvantage, so the Navy Department has issued the above ban. The Navy Department will not make the original text of the ban public, but according to what is generally known, in the next annual report to Congress, all information that can reveal the United States' improvement of the navy will not be included, such as the construction of warships, aircraft, giant cannons, radio equipment, defensive mines, and the improvement methods of aircraft. The ban will also apply to government-owned shipyards and private shipyards that build warships for the Navy Department. Furthermore, foreigners are strictly prohibited from visiting the new 26,000-ton aircraft carrier "Yorktown" and the "Saratoga," which are under construction at Newport News Port near Norfolk, and the 13,000-ton aircraft carrier "Revenge," which recently cruised in South America and is now being renovated. In addition, a recent film fully revealed the driving skills of U.S. Navy bomber pilots, allowing foreign countries to understand the secrets, so navy films will also be strictly inspected. If foreigners want to visit U.S. warships or board naval ships for tours, they must obtain permission from the Chief of Naval Operations and the Director of the Bureau of Navigation in advance. The Navy Department originally had an anti-espionage intelligence agency, which was abolished after the Great War. It has now been restored in June of this year, and Navy Colonel Van Hook has been appointed as its director. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Ba尔温's Remarks</p>
<p>Causing a Dutch Reaction</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Declares Loyalty to Traditional Policies</p>
<p>Dutch Territory Will Not Allow Others to Use It</p>
<p>Dutch Capital – British Privy Councilor Baldwin once declared in the House of Commons, "The British border is on the Rhine." Today, Foreign Minister Graaf issued a declaration on Baldwin's remarks, saying that the Netherlands has always been loyal to its traditional policies, and it is a mistake for outsiders to think that Dutch territory can be used for the defense of other countries. In conclusion, Mr. Graaf said that the Netherlands will never follow any country or group. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Disputes Arise Again Over Disarmament</p>
<p>Austria Demands Equal Arms Rights</p>
<p>Clearly Showing Italy's Instigation</p>
<p>(London) – Disputes have arisen again in the disarmament situation, this time from Austria, because Austrian representative Flugel, who attended the disarmament conference, said today that if other countries increase their armaments, Austria will have no way to defend itself, so unless it first obtains equal rights, Austria will not be able to join any treaty. This is the first time Austria has publicly interfered in the disarmament issue. People in Vienna's political circles are paying close attention. It is generally believed that this must be related to the Rome Pact signed by Austria, Italy, and Hungary in March of this year, and is instigated by Italy, because Italy wants Austria to be strong.

<p>The bandits Ding Changkai, Meng Qingyu, and others, three in total, arrived in Kunshan by train from Shanghai yesterday morning. They were filling their stomachs in a small teahouse next to the station. Detective Luo Zhen of the county's Public Security Bureau learned of this and immediately led detectives to arrest Ding and the other two. According to their confession, there were many accomplices who came by waterway and were scheduled to meet in Zhouxiang Town, and then carry out a robbery somewhere. Based on the confession, Detective Luo urgently led the police to the destination to wait, but the bandits were well-informed and already knew that Meng and others had been arrested. They fled back to Shanghai, so Detective Luo and others waited until evening without any results. The three bandits were then escorted to the bureau and transferred to the county for investigation.</p>

<p>Japanese Envoy Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Speaking of this trip as merely an inspection of embassy affairs</p>
<p>Gratitude for the courteous hospitality of our officials along the way</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch states that the Japanese Minister to China, Akira Ariyoshi, along with his counselors Arino, Secretary Yokokawa, and others, went to Peiping last month to inspect embassy affairs. Subsequently, they visited Jinan and Qingdao and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2 PM aboard the Dalian Steamship Company's Qingdao Maru from Qingdao. The local Japanese Consul-General and other Japanese residents went to welcome him. The Japanese envoy immediately received journalists aboard the ship to discuss the journey. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Qingdao Maru docked at the Huangpu Wharf at 2 PM. The Public Concession Police and the Japanese Consulate Police dispatched armed constables to the port to maintain security. Mrs. Ariyoshi, Counselor Horiuchi of the Japanese Embassy, Consul-General Ishii, Director of the Intelligence Department Ashino Hiroshi, Police Chief Hanari, Commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Sugibane, and local Japanese residents all arrived to welcome him. Commissioner Wang Changchun of the Shanghai Municipal Government also arrived to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, the Japanese envoy shook hands with all the welcoming personnel, then disembarked, got into a car, and went directly to his residence on Rue Bisson to rest.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Japanese Envoy</p>
<p>The Japanese envoy met with journalists aboard the ship and made the following remarks: "This trip north was to inspect embassy affairs. On the return journey, I toured Jinan, Qingdao, and other places. I am very grateful for the courteous hospitality of the Chinese officials along the way. In Peiping, I met with Chairman Huang of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee several times, but these were merely private social engagements and did not involve discussions on Sino-Japanese issues. Regarding the mutual exchange of ambassadors between China and Japan, there was a lot of talk about it several years ago. I do not know whether the Japanese government will bring it up again due to the promotion of the Chinese Minister to Italy. The addition of a Counselor to the Japanese Embassy in China is still under consideration." As for the American telegram regarding the convening of a Pacific Conference, Ariyoshi did not wish to comment, stating only that he did not know the details of this news because he was traveling.</p>
<p>Antiquities in Shanghai</p>
<p>Continued Inventory Yesterday</p>

The box numbers were originally classified and numbered by the Antiquities Museum. For the convenience of registration, a general number was brushed on all four sides of the box, starting with Shanghai Character Number One for the boxes being inventoried this time, to ensure consistency. Boxes not completely inventoried by one group were sealed by the surveillance committee members for the next group to continue inventorying, to ensure thoroughness.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Convene a Plenary Board Meeting in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Finance Committee of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee held a meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday in the meeting room of the British Bank, reviewed and approved important cases such as Jiangsu Province borrowing more than one million to purchase fishing vessels. Details are as follows:</p>

<p>Discussion of Cases</p>
<p>After the meeting began, the chairman introduced Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, who reported on the plan to borrow more than one million in Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase fishing vessels and the completion of the guarantee. The committee unanimously reviewed and approved the plan. Next, they discussed the case of the Ministry of Industry and the Zhejiang Provincial Government borrowing more than one million in Boxer Indemnity funds to build a paper mill in Wenxi, Zhejiang. Because Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, was not present, no decision was made, but it is generally considered that there is no problem and it is expected to be approved at the general meeting. Then, other important cases were discussed, which will not be announced for the time being because they need to be submitted to the general meeting for approval. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Board Meeting</p>
<p>The committee is scheduled to hold an executive meeting on Saturday and a general meeting of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee next Monday at the Bankers' Club on Hong Kong Road. At that time, it will, based on the finance committee’s review report, approve the Jiangsu Province borrowing Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase fishing vessels.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Suspends Overseas Routes</p>
<p>Puan Wheel Returned to the Ministry of Navy</p>
<p>Haiheng Wheel Expected to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch states that the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Puan Wheel was initially jointly operated with the Ministry of Navy, remodeled into a passenger ship, and traveled between Shanghai and Qingdao, also visiting Putuo. Later, after the contract expired, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company leased and operated it. Recently, the company received an order from the Ministry of Communications to open overseas routes. It was originally intended to repair the ship and sail between Shanghai and Southeast Asia, but due to the company's financial difficulties and uncertainty about the business after opening overseas routes, the plan was temporarily abandoned. The company has canceled the expiring contract with the Ministry of Navy and sent personnel to remove all equipment from the ship and return it to the Ministry of Navy. In addition, the Haiheng Wheel, which the company ordered to be built in England, has already completed its construction and sailed to China for delivery, following the Haiyuan Wheel. It is expected to arrive at the port around the 27th or 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Copper and Iron Machinery Association</p>
<p>Efforts to Promote Sales of Domestic Products</p>
<p>A Stimulant in a Period of Depressed Imports</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Copper and Iron Machinery Association of this city has been extremely earnest about the work of resisting imported goods. With the unity of everyone, after the January 28th Incident, factories voluntarily concentrated and sealed up foreign iron. Last summer, in order to support our country's only Liukegou domestic pig iron, they loudly appealed to help promote sales, and did their best to advise iron merchants and users. As a result, the sales of domestic iron increased greatly, and foreign iron almost disappeared from the market. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to commend their exemplary role, presented a plaque inscribed with "Keeping Faith" to commemorate them. However, with the passage of time, people became complacent. Recently, it was discovered that some unscrupulous people were selling foreign iron for personal gain, and some members of the industry also violated the agreement and privately imported foreign iron. In order to consolidate the foundation of resisting goods and to prevent domestic iron from stagnating, which would affect future national defense plans, the enthusiastic members of the association have renewed their spirits and continued to work hard. On the one hand, they have sent personnel to conduct strict investigations, and on the other hand, they have notified all members to adhere to their original intentions and carry them through to the end. They have also sent a letter to the Iron Industry Association to assist in the process. It is expected that after a period of solid work, the results will be even more impressive. The original text of the association's notice to members is as follows: Notice: This association has always believed that the rise and fall of domestic iron has a long-term relationship with the rise and fall of national defense, and a short-term impact on the personal interests of this industry. Therefore, last year, we organized an office to promote the sale of domestic iron, striving to promote domestic goods and resist foreign aggression. Thanks to the enthusiastic patriotism of our colleagues and their concerted support, we have achieved remarkable results over the past year. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has specially awarded a plaque to commend us, which is not only the glory of this association in promoting domestic goods, but also the spirit of our colleagues who understand the great righteousness and are united in saving the country. We should encourage ourselves to do even better and persevere to the end. However, we are afraid that with the passage of time, people will become complacent, or that some unscrupulous people will forget righteousness for profit and privately import foreign goods, becoming a scourge to our colleagues. We must once again carry out strict rectification and reaffirm the old agreement. Therefore, this notice is issued, urging colleagues to adhere to their original intentions, uphold the previous agreement, and not slacken in the slightest. We must work together with this association, fight to the end, and the future of saving the country depends on it. We also plan to send personnel to continue to conduct strict investigations in various factories. If it is found that foreign goods have been privately imported, in addition to being dealt with in accordance with the original penalty rules, we must also publish it in the newspapers for public opinion to censure. We hope that you will cherish your reputation and not be abandoned by the Chinese people or despised by foreigners. This is our sincere hope. This notice is hereby issued, and we hope you will take note.</p>

<p>Lawyers Association Sends Letter to French Consul-General</p>
<p>To Stop the Police Abusing Their Power</p>
<p>Police Department Sends Letter to the Court to Seal Up Shops</p>
<p>Interfering with Lawyers Handling Cases According to Law</p>
<p>Which is Damage to the Agreement Establishing Chinese Courts in the French Concession</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Meyrier, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, which stated: "We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from member Ye Changyi, he was entrusted on November 5 of this year to handle the liquidation of Rentai Chang Kee and Andong Socks Factory. The two shops were not open for business that day, and the member sent staff to guard the goods in the shops and posted liquidation notices on the doors of the two shops, in addition to publishing them in Shen and Xin Bao, to inform creditors to register according to law. Unexpectedly, the French police suddenly sent detectives at 10 AM to arrest the person guarding the goods in Rentai Chang Kee and detained him for six hours. At the same time, they allowed many people claiming to be creditors to enter and leave the shop to guard it. When the member learned of this at 7 PM, he realized that if the above actions were true, he would be responsible for any loss of goods in the shop. Therefore, he drove to the shop to investigate, but found that there were police guarding both shop entrances, preventing him from entering. The member told them that he was the liquidator and showed them his badge and calling card, but to no avail. Therefore, he went to the police station to negotiate and asked them to withdraw the police, but was refused. They said that they could only withdraw after the court sealed up the shop. On the 6th of this month, the French Concession Police Department suddenly sent an official letter to the Second Special District Local Court requesting the seal up. Since then, the member has been unable to check the goods in the shop and has been unable to carry out the liquidation and convene the proceedings. Liquidating the accounts of a shop is purely a civil matter and has nothing to do with the police. However, they have arrested people and prohibited the liquidator from performing his duties. On the contrary, they have allowed many unnamed people claiming to be creditors to enter and leave the shop at will. This is undoubtedly an abuse of power and interference in the judiciary. As the above two shops have entrusted a liquidator to declare liquidation according to law, everything concerning the shop should be subject to legal裁制. How can the police openly advocate to the court to issue a seal up? Therefore, this behavior of the police is not only a violation of the agreement, but also an interference in the judiciary and an infringement on private rights. If this trend continues, the people will lose the protection of the law. Therefore, we have reported the beginning and end of the matter in detail to the meeting and hope that you will raise it for discussion and advocate for correction." Based on this, it is found that lawyers are entrusted by the parties to handle shop liquidation and are performing their duties according to law, free from interference by third parties. However, the governing police station, without examining the facts, abused its power and sent police to prohibit lawyers from exercising their duties, which is not in accordance with the law. Moreover, the Police Department sent a letter to the Second Special District Local Court requesting the seal up of the shop, which is even more illegal. The court's seal up disposition in civil matters is a preservation procedure or compulsory execution applied to the defendant based on the plaintiff's or the executor's application. The Police Department is neither a civil plaintiff nor an executor, and has no right to act on its behalf. In summary, this not only has the suspicion of interfering in the judiciary, but also should bear the responsibility for damaging the agreement establishing Chinese courts in the French Concession. After the joint meeting of the 183rd Executive and Supervisory Committee of this association, it was decided that a letter should be sent to your Consul-General to stop and correct the matter. Accordingly, we send this letter and hope that you will investigate and stop the aforementioned illegal and abusive behavior of the police station and the Police Department, so as to strengthen diplomatic relations and give a reply on the handling of the matter. This is our sincere hope. Signed, the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, to Mr. Meyrier, French Consul-General in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee</p>
<p>Fund of 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Silver Transported to Coastal Areas for Re-export</p>
<p>Efforts are Being Made by the Ministry of Finance to Stop It</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch states that a member of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee told reporters that the committee's fund of 10 million yuan, with 4 million yuan each from the Central Bank and the Bank of China and 2 million yuan from the Bank of Communications, is not prepaid but paid on demand. On the morning of the 19th, the committee announced the equalization tax at 7.75%. It was also said that since the implementation of the silver tax increase, silver exports have been reduced to a very small number, but there is more flow to various ports in the interior. Silver transported to various coastal ports is inevitably smuggled out, and the Ministry of Finance is now trying to prevent it.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Relief Committee</p>
<p>Sends Personnel to Various Counties for Relief Distribution</p>
<p>Administrative Yuan Disallows Additional Levy of Transportation Surtax</p>
<p>Tax Exemption for Relief Grain Requires Review and Transmission by the Relief Committee</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Relief Committee sent a letter to the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Relief Committee yesterday to distribute relief directors in various counties and levy additional transportation surtax for the relief of the Zhejiang disaster. It was not approved. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Relief Committee to the Jiaxu Committee: The Zhejiang Relief Committee's letter to the Jiaxu Committee states that the drought disaster in Zhejiang this year has been severe. The committee, together with the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, sent personnel to various counties to investigate and reported to the provincial government for review. Although the investigation and reporting have not yet been completed, the winter season has arrived, and the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold and are in dire need of food. It is imperative to select the counties most severely affected by the disaster and conduct winter relief distribution first to provide assistance. The counties with lighter disasters will be included in the work relief plan and handled together. It is found that Hai'ning and Haiyan, two counties severely affected by the disaster, have already had personnel sent by the Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society, and Jiaxing, Chongde, Tongxiang, Shangyu, Shengxian, and Xinchang have had personnel sent by your committee to investigate and distribute relief separately. In addition, the committee has selected experienced relief personnel to be responsible for investigating and distributing winter relief in 30 counties including Wuxing. In addition to submitting a request to the provincial government for additional appointments and sending separate notices, a list of the names of the directors of relief distribution is enclosed for your information. Furthermore, Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, and Sui'an counties have been hit by both drought and banditry, and the disaster situation is particularly severe. Also, Fuyang County is a paper-producing area, and according to the county magistrate's application, relief funds should be allocated to maintain the paper mill. Hangzhou City belongs to the provincial area, and the provincial granary has already started distributing porridge in advance, which can be used to provide relief to disaster victims. It is proposed to submit a separate case for review. Therefore, it is not included in the list of counties allocated for relief distribution this time. This is combined and clarified. Chairman Lu Bichou of the Zhejiang Relief Committee, Standing Committee members Zhang Zaiyang, Feng Xueshu, Jin Changshun, and Qian Wenxuan.</p>
<p>District Directors: The relief directors assigned to various counties by the Zhejiang Relief Committee are recorded as follows: (1) Gu Zongkuang: Wukang, Yuhang, Deqing. (2) Wu Sanqing: Wuxing, Changxing, Dongyang. (3) Jin Da: Anji, Xiaofeng. (4) Shen Guilin: Hang County, Yuqian, Lin'an, Tonglu. (5) Wang Hao: Fenshui, Xindeng. (6) Wu Wenqi: Jiande, Pujiang, Chun'an, Shouchang. (7) Pan Junlin: Yongkang, Wuyi. (8) Tian Yudong: Tiantai, Xianju. (8) Lu Zhinan: Jinhua, Lanxi, Qu County, Longyou. (10) Shen Zaichuan: Xuanping, Jinyun, Songyang. (11) Shen Pei'an: Xiao'an.</p>
<p>Transportation Surtax: According to the Great Letter, Cheng Hongjun and others in Tongxiang telegraphed requesting to levy a traffic surtax for disaster relief, citing previous cases. This request has been presented to the provincial government and forwarded to the Executive Yuan, which has instructed that it should not be approved. It is truly beyond our ability to meet the need. The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway disaster relief surtax was initiated by this province, and there is said to be approval for a trial, but no order has been received from the provincial government. The letter is hereby returned for your information.</p>
<p>Tax-Exempt Relief Goods: The Zhejiang Provincial Government replied to the relief committee, stating that the committee's previous telegram requesting that the Ministry of Finance be consulted to exempt import taxes on relief grain had been forwarded and replied to by telegram. Now, the Ministry of Finance's Guanzi No. 9612 replied, stating that the provincial government's Minzi No. 2989 requested that the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Relief Committee plans to purchase 100,000 shi of relief grain from Nanyang, Siam, Java, and other places, and transport it in batches to Shanghai and then to various counties in the interior severely affected by the disaster for winter and spring relief. It requested that import taxes be exempted to benefit the poor. According to the situation, the request was forwarded to the department for review and reply. According to regulations, tax exemption for disaster relief goods should be requested by the relief committee and reviewed and transmitted by the relief committee to the ministry for review and approval. This is hereby replied and you are requested to inform us. Chairman Lu Dipin.</p>
<p>Shandong Tobacco-Producing Area</p>
<p>Dai Gengxin Returns from Inspection</p>
<p>Says the Future is Quite Promising</p>
<p>Dai Gengxin, Chairman of the Huacheng Tobacco Company, along with three American tobacco merchants including William Henney, went to the tobacco-producing areas of Huangqibao, Ershilibao, Tanjia, Fangzi, Yangjiazhuang, and Xindian, all under the jurisdiction of Qingzhou, Shandong, to inspect the tobacco produced and the conditions of the rural areas. The group returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (20th). Mr. Dai gave a speech yesterday, saying that the tobacco leaves used by the Chinese cigarette industry are mostly from Qingzhou, Shandong, and Xuzhou, Henan. This is because the tobacco leaves in these two places are the same type as those produced in Florida and Virginia in the United States, and the Qingzhou tobacco leaves taste more mellow. Therefore, the tobacco companies in this city go to these two places every autumn to collect them, and the quantity is very large. If the tobacco leaves produced in our country can be transported overseas, there will definitely be opportunities for sales. (I, Dai, claimed) When I was in Europe last time, I discussed this idea with various European merchants, and they expressed great sympathy. Now, the samples of tobacco leaves have been sent there. This time, William Henney, chairman of the American Tobacco Company, came to China in return, and also believes that Chinese tobacco leaves can be sold overseas. However, foreigners are afraid that Chinese farmers have improper behaviors, such as mixing sand and mud or soaking them in water, as was the case with agricultural products exported in the past. Therefore, they cannot be trusted by foreigners, which is regrettable. This time, going to various leaf-producing areas with Zhang Lingheng and others can gain insight into the conditions of rural areas, the behavior of farmers, and the quality of tobacco leaves in our country. This trip is very satisfactory. I have met with people from all walks of life in various places, and they all believe that the transportation and sale of tobacco leaves overseas will be very beneficial to the rural economy in the country. The welcome from various places was very lively, and the protection from the government was very thorough, which is especially appreciated. When I was in Jinan, I met with bankers and asked them to set up more offices in rural areas to lend money to farmers to help the rural areas. Farmers who grow tobacco leaves need to use soybean cake for irrigation and burn coal for baking, so the cost is greater than for other crops, and the profit is also large. Reports that loans were borrowed from Shanghai banks for the harvest of tobacco leaves are inaccurate. Chinese people established the China Tobacco Leaf Company in Qingdao in 1920. I am honored to be the chairman of the board, and I registered with the Ministry of Industry early on and built factories, warehouses, and leaf-baking machines to specialize in the selection of domestic tobacco leaves, with remarkable results. This time, I went with American tobacco giants to study and research, and the soil in Shandong is fertile and most suitable for growing tobacco leaves. Moreover, the tobacco leaves produced have continued to improve compared to the past. The American merchants also believe that they are not much different from those produced in the United States. If we can continue to study gradually to seek improvement, there is great hope. I have suggested to Zhang Youshan, Director of the Construction Department of Shandong Province, to supervise farmers to cultivate, and he has greatly appreciated it. Director Zhang attaches great importance to the promotion of tobacco leaf production as a major product of Shandong Province and believes that it is essential to promote farmers' production. This will not only allow domestic tobacco factories to collect as much as possible, but also seek to sell it overseas, occupy a superior position in international trade, and prevent it from declining permanently. The economy of Shandong farmers will inevitably improve day by day.</p>

<p>New Cotton from Zhejiang and Anhui Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank Acts as a Wholesale Agent</p>
<p>Direct Sales to Factories are More Valuable</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Bank provided loans to farmers in various provinces and organized cotton production and sales cooperatives, new cotton from Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces has begun to be shipped to Shanghai. New cotton from Zhejiang and Anhui has arrived in Shanghai. The cotton produced in Longquan Township, Yuyao, Zhejiang, is called Million Cotton and is of excellent quality. The first batch was sold by farmers of the cooperative to cotton firms in Ningbo and Shanghai, at 43 yuan per dan in Ningbo and 45 yuan per dan in Shanghai. The Shanghai Bank believes that the sale of this cotton should be sold directly to manufacturers. This time, the second batch of cotton arriving in Shanghai is being sold by the Shanghai Bank as an agent, at a price of 50 yuan per dan, which is 5 yuan more than the previous sale to cotton firms. Moreover, the market is now lower than before. Assuming that the production of Million Cotton in that township is 1,000 dan per year, the difference is a total of 10,000 yuan. The Shanghai Bank has decided that all cooperative cotton will be sold directly to manufacturers by the bank.</p>

<p>Chen Hang Prepares to Connect to Telephone</p>
<p>The Chen Hang District in Pudong, in order to facilitate communication, previously planned to connect to the Shanghai urban telephone network. Xing Zhigang, the head of the district, consulted with Chen Zixin, the municipal commissioner of Yangsi District, and made every effort to consult with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. A satisfactory solution has now been reached. The reply from Mr. Chen is recorded below: "Regarding the case of your district requesting to connect to the urban telephone network, we have now received a letter from the Telephone Bureau, which has formulated three methods: (1) The poles and wires in the urban area will be installed by the Telephone Bureau, and the poles and wires in the county area will be installed by your district itself. A public telephone will be set up in our district and charged by the number of calls. (2) The Telephone Bureau will install the poles and wires in both the urban and county areas, and the monthly fee for users will be reduced based on the number of calls (approximately 5-6 yuan per month). (3) Long-distance calls will be charged according to long-distance telephone rates. The above three methods have been submitted to the department for approval, and will be implemented as soon as approval is obtained. Please send a map of the county area as soon as possible for surveying and planning." According to this, Mr. Xing has submitted a map and requested it to be forwarded, and is soliciting opinions from local people in the neighboring districts of Sanlintang and the central river, so that they can compile them and ask the Telephone Bureau to review and handle them. We are waiting for progress.</p>

<p>The Wu Jiang Telegraph Bureau's long-distance telephone service previously only connected to Suzhou and Jiaxing, so business was not very developed. Now, the Jiangsu Long-Distance Telephone Administration has submitted a request, approved by the Ministry of Communications, to open Songjiang, Liuhe, Wu Jiang, and Pingwang for telephone service to various locations along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, as well as Jingjiang and Nantong. All incoming and outgoing calls from these locations will be relayed through Shanghai for Songjiang, through Taicang for Liuhe, and through Suzhou for Wu Jiang and Pingwang. Operations officially commenced on the 16th, making transportation in Wu Jiang even more convenient.</p>

<p>Wang Kaicheng, a farmer from Wutangmen Township in the southern suburbs, lived a modest life. However, at around 6 PM the other night, six robbers suddenly arrived, armed with porcelain pistols and flashlights. They entered his home and robbed him, forbidding anyone from making a sound. Wang's wife, Hua, resisted slightly and was injured in the arm. They made off with three gold rings, three gold bangles, four gold bracelets, and silver dollars, totaling over one hundred yuan in losses. Furthermore, at the Taian Inn in Shantou Lane outside the North Gate, three violent travelers robbed the innkeeper's wife, Xu Ge, of two gold Ruyi hairpins she was wearing while she was in the room preparing tea, fleeing immediately after. Since the loss was minimal, the victim did not report to the authorities to request an investigation.</p>
<p>The Phenomenon of Industrial and Commercial Failure</p>
<p>The county used to be known as "Little Shanghai" during the heyday of silk factories. In recent years, silkworm farming has failed, silk factories have closed, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and commerce has plummeted. While commerce was still flourishing in the years 1929, 1930, 1931, and 1932, each year since 1932 has been worse than the last, and this year is the worst of all. In previous years, monthly stamp sales throughout the county could reach around 30,000 yuan. However, in recent months, monthly sales have only reached 16,000 or 17,000 yuan, a decrease of 40% compared to previous years. This is clear evidence of industrial and commercial failure.</p>

<p>Clerks within and outside the Land Tax Office of the County Government colluded to embezzle funds. After investigations by various agencies, it was discovered that over 13,000 yuan in forged payment receipts were issued within the land price tax for the 22nd year. Some of the payment receipts are still scattered among the people, and the total amount is impossible to verify. To thoroughly investigate the matter, a public notice has been issued to all grain households, requiring them to register any payment receipts they have with the Land Tax Office within one month. Expired receipts will be rendered invalid.</p>
<p>Drug Pill Operation Cracked in Changjing Town</p>
<p>The scourge of Jiangyin's "red pills" is most prevalent in Changjing, making it the hub for trafficking, selling, and consumption. The distribution of the drug pills covers the three counties of Cheng, Xi, and Qin. The red pill criminals had been skillful and organized, and the ring had never been caught. After the provincial government strictly prohibited highly addictive narcotics, local figures from the region formed a drug resistance association. Recently, a certain university graduate, Song Qixiang, and Li Guozhen, a graduate from Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, with Li Ruibao, the wife of Shen Yu, secretly established a red pill operation. Due to uneven distribution of profits, the scheme was leaked. The drug resistance association searched the premises and found equipment and raw materials. Shen's wife, Li Ruibao, and Song Qixiang were arrested. On the 19th, they were interrogated by Cheng Shi, the magistrate. Song Qixiang and others firmly denied the charges. After summonsing witnesses, they will be handed over to the provincial garrison headquarters for further investigation.</p>

<p>Yu Yuanfa, 32, from Taiping Lane east of Shuangqigan outside Huaiyin City, recently opened a fat pig business in Xiaozhangji, Lianshui. Yesterday (the 18th), he went to Pu to collect funds and was returning to Lianshui with silver dollars at noon. While traveling through the Majia Dadian area, about four or five li from Pu, he was suddenly intercepted by bandits. In addition to stealing over 1,000 yuan in cash that he was carrying, they shot Yuanfa with three bullets to the head, causing him to die instantly from his injuries. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>Due to rampant banditry in the six counties of the Nantong District (Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi, and Jing), the district headquarters has ordered the six counties to immediately dispatch security teams to conduct a joint household registration check with the district head to arrest hidden bandits and strictly suppress transient migrants from other regions to eliminate the source of bandits. To prevent bandits from fleeing from one area to another during suppression efforts, Commander Zheng issued a joint suppression certificate, without territorial restrictions.</p>

<p>Li Guangbing, a student at Nantong Middle School, was traveling from Rugao to Tong on Su-Character No. 735 bus, carrying a package containing 1,800 yuan in cash entrusted to him by a relative. He handed it to the bus driver, Pan Hesheng, only stating that it contained peanuts and tied it to the outside footboard. It was lost on the way, leading to a dispute. On the 20th, the case was reported to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the court. Pan Hesheng was detained after interrogation.</p>

<p>Director Fu of the County Relief Institute once raised 1,000 yuan to organize a loan office to aid the poor, lending sums ranging from three or four yuan to ten yuan at a monthly interest rate of six percent. This was considered convenient by the general population of the poor. However, such small and short-term loans only benefited small vendors in the urban area and did not reach farmers. Recently, Zhu Bohong, the director of the County People's Education Center, initiated a solicitation of honest farmers and guided the organization of a credit cooperative to facilitate financial turnover. The People's Education Center is also responsible for borrowing from banks and providing guarantees. Currently, the cooperatives that have been approved for establishment in various districts include San Yangzhuang and Xiao Haozhuang in Guanwang Township, Wangzhuang in Gaozuo Town, Pancun in Pancun Township, Zhangcun in Heping Township, Zhaizhuang in Hequ Township, and Maqiaozhuang in the Eighth District. Others, such as Zhan Cheng, are also in preparation. The county government has issued separate instructions to revise any parts of the cooperative organizations that do not comply with the new provincial regulations.</p>

<p>Chen Songlin, of No. 8, Dangpu Lane, Jinzhi Temple Lane, Hangzhou, was holding a wedding for his son, Chen Zixue, who is 27 years old and works as a fortune teller. Chen Zixue is blind. He was marrying A'er, the daughter of Yu Fengxiang of No. 119, Pishi Lane, who is also blind and works as a fortune teller. They came together as fellow apprentices. Yesterday (the 20th) was the wedding day. The bride's family ordered a large batch of green rice flour balls from Ruan Shunxing Rice Cake Shop in Lianqiao. They were delivered to the groom's house at 9 AM. The groom's family distributed the green rice flour balls to the neighbors, two or three to each household, and kept ten to send back to the bride's family, also distributing them to their neighbors. However, after eating the rice flour balls, everyone complained of stomach pain and vomiting. A total of thirty people were poisoned. They all complained to the bride's family and the rice cake shop, and reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, which sent the poisoned people to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. According to the doctors, the poisoning was caused by food coloring. While the lighter cases were not life-threatening, eating too much could be dangerous.

<p>American Cotton: The cotton market was quiet and lackluster due to the weakness of the wheat market and favorable weather reports. The opening price fell by 3-4 points. Prices then recovered slightly due to purchases from Liverpool and demand from colleagues. Trading was limited and unremarkable. The market situation is easily affected. The ginning report estimates that a total of 8,633,000 bales of new cotton were ginned before November 14th. This figure had little impact on the cotton market. The ginning figure for October 31st was 7,920,000 bales.</p>

<p>New York: The rubber market opened down 4-5 points, but soon recovered.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: Wall Street expected the securities market to be stable and sluggish this morning. Unfavorable labor-management relations caused considerable anxiety, but if the report to be released today by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. proves to be satisfactory, the market situation can be expected to be lively. Before the opening of securities trading this morning, the factors favorable to the market situation were: (1) The pressure on public utility stocks has gradually shown signs of exhaustion; (2) The number of shares sold during price declines continues to decrease; (3) Although market price fluctuations have been recently uncertain, market commentators are mostly bullish; (4) Chicago steel mill output accounts for 33% of production capacity, an increase of two points compared to before. The factors unfavorable to the market situation are: the lack of driving force, the bearishness of the wheat market is also disturbing, and (5) public investors remain few. The securities market opened stable this morning, with very small price fluctuations and active trading. The atmosphere is pleasant and shows signs of progress. The various market prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Following the Exchange of Ambassadors Between China and Turkey</p>
<p>Negotiations for a Sino-Turkish Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>He Yaozu Can Present Proposals for Signing Upon Taking Office Next Month</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that after the Sino-Turkish Treaty of Friendship was concluded on April 4, 1934, by our Ambassador to Switzerland, Hu Shize, on behalf of the government, in the Turkish capital with Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi, the treaty was reviewed and approved by our Legislative Yuan on May 26 of this year. The Turkish government ratified the treaty on June 4 and it took effect on September 1. Recently, our government officially appointed He Yaozu as the first ambassador to Turkey and he is scheduled to depart for Turkey to assume his post at the beginning of next month. The Turkish ambassador to China has also been appointed. According to sources in diplomatic circles, after the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Turkey, the two sides are preparing to negotiate a Sino-Turkish commercial treaty. The signing of this commercial treaty is urgently needed by the overseas Chinese communities in both countries. Overseas Chinese in Turkey, including Ma Hongdao and Wang Zengshan, have repeatedly petitioned our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to expedite the signing of the commercial treaty to facilitate business in foreign countries. In view of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is actively deliberating the matter. After Ambassador He Yaozu arrives in Turkey, the issue of the commercial treaty will be formally presented to the Turkish government for negotiation and signing at an early date. According to customs reports, the current state of trade between China and Turkey in 1933 saw China's imports at approximately 4,800 yuan and exports at 52,300 yuan. However, these figures only refer to maritime trade. Due to geographical reasons, Sino-Turkish trade relies more on land trade, so the volume of trade between China and Turkey is still considerable and has been developing rapidly this year. It is expected that international trade between China and Turkey will make significant progress after the Sino-Turkish commercial treaty is formally signed.</p>

<p>Education Bureau Issues</p>
<p>Middle School Student Registration Form Style</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed all secondary schools, stating, "In investigating student registration, the school should have detailed records of the student's educational experience, the registration process, and the Bureau's review situation, so that it can be easily checked and reviewed from time to time to avoid errors. In the past, schools have often not paid attention to this, resulting in students being rejected upon graduation because the procedures were not met, and the schools were still at a loss and did not know why. The impact is not small. In view of this, in order to remedy this situation, the Bureau has formulated a type of student registration form for self-use by schools, which schools should imitate and apply. However, if the original method is indeed excellent, it can also be used as a reference to achieve perfection, and it must be completed within one month of the arrival of the document. The Bureau will send personnel to the school for spot checks at any time, and all shall comply." This order is accompanied by a sample of the student registration form for self-use by schools.</p>

After the 30 competitors started, veteran Dong Shuzhao immediately took the lead. However, the ten behind him were generally not far apart, separated by only a few meters. Upon reaching the finish line, Dong Shuzhao was still first. The runner-up, Yang Qingxie, was more than twenty meters behind, and Wang Dayao of Central was another twenty meters behind.

<p>St. John's Defeats Chih Tze by a Large Margin</p>
<p>64 to 43</p>
<p>—Tonight Group A South Star vs. MacLaine—</p>
<p>The Western YMCA basketball game started at 7:15 last night, with two Group B games and one Group A game.

The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>With the help of Zhang Shirong, a strong player from North China, St. John's forwards were extremely active. The entire team's cooperation was also very skilled. Chih Tze's basketball skills were slightly improved compared to the previous day. At the beginning of the game, the two sides were evenly matched, tied at six to six. After that, St. John's three forwards gradually showed their strength, and took the lead all the way. Chih Tze's lack of tight organization resulted in a 35 to 16 defeat in the first half. In the second half, St. John's used substitute players. The two sides were evenly matched, with back-and-forth scoring. Chen Yunwan and Xu Jianqing of Chih Tze were quite accurate in shooting, and were the most effective players on the team. At the end of the game, St. John's won 64 to 43.</p>

<p>Public Race Walking Registration Deadline</p>
<p>▲More than 110 Men ▲35 Women</p>
<p>The registration for the 4th Shanghai Open Race Walking Competition to be held this Sunday closed last night (the 19th). A total of 113 men and women participated. In general, because there are many sports events this season, with almost no week without a competition, and members who have represented the Chinese team are not allowed to participate, the male participants in this competition are fewer than in previous years. The Shanghai West team, which won the championship last year, only participated individually in this competition, so only five teams participated in the group competition: Meteor Team, Navy and Air Force Team, San Duo Team, Morning Light Team, and Zhenhua Team. The number of female participants has not decreased, reaching as many as 35 people, including Guo Pinzhen and five others from Liangjiang Sports Teachers, Yan Fuhua and seven others from Southeast Sports College, Qiu Meizhen and two others from Minli Girls' High School, Zhao Suying and one other from Zhirenyong Girls' School, Yang Su'e from East Asia Sports College, Li Xiuzhen from Daozhong Girls' School, Shen Xiuying from Shanghai Girls' High School, He Hongfang from Tongji High School, Yao Ying from Cihang Obstetrics and Gynecology, and individual Xu Zhongji, Zhang Gushi, Lin Yunfen, Wang Zhiying, Zhu Zhiying, etc. It is known that the Chinese Race Walking Association has specifically designated to distribute competitor number cloths and guide armbands after 5:30 PM tomorrow. Each competitor may invite one guide to accompany them on a bicycle. All registered participants should go to the association to collect them, affix them to the front and back of their chests, and sew them around the edges. The guide's armband should be worn on the left arm, with the number facing outward. The relationship between the competitor and the guide is very important, not only to take care of them along the way and provide drinks and towels, but also to report the competitor's pace and time for each lap at any time, so that the competitor can be excited and move forward according to the rhythm, which will definitely create excellent results.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Remembering Mr. Shi Liangcai <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Speaking of national products, we cannot but remember Mr. Shi Liangcai. After the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, the Chinese people frowned and gnashed their teeth, wanting to find a way to avenge themselves and wipe out the shame. It can be said that this accounted for the majority of the population. But empty talk of revenge and wiping out the shame is of course useless. At that time, Mr. Shi, in the local association, convened a meeting with various gentlemen to discuss the idea of arousing the people's attention to using national products. It was specifically designated that the 22nd year of the Republic of China would be the National Products Year. A National Products Weekly was specially created in the Shen Bao to advocate and promote it. He specially instructed the editor and Mr. Du Chongyuan to preside over the editing. Mr. Shi inquired and encouraged us every time we met. At the end of last year, he convened another meeting at the local association. Because women have a greater responsibility for using national products, this year was officially designated as the Women's National Products Year. He also instructed the editor to visit and specially commend those who have made practical contributions to the national products business and those who have succeeded in the industrial world after arduous struggles, so that the national products industry would have hope for progress. This year, which has been designated as the Women's National Products Year, Mr. Shi also instructed us to interview female leaders and enthusiastic women about their opinions on national products for the reference of the national products industry. Mr. Shi wholeheartedly supported and encouraged the editor in any requests made to him regarding national products companies and factories, so that they would be successful. I still remember a few days before Mr. Shi went to Hangzhou, the editor went to the newspaper office at Mr. Shi's invitation to talk. Mr. Shi said that promoting national products should be considered from the National Products Year itself. What are the difficulties in the national products industry? What are the obstacles to the national products industry? How many shortcomings should be addressed? How many advantages should be imitated? What are the reasons why they cannot compete with foreign goods? All of these should be investigated on the ground and disclosed completely so that the people would have the opportunity to think of ways to address them. Therefore, a special investigation record of the national products industry was added to the newspaper for the research of those who care about the national products business. Such enthusiasm, perseverance, vision, and insight for the struggle and labor for the national products industry is worth remembering and cherishing. Although Mr. Shi is dead, Mr. Shi's spirit is not dead, Mr. Shi's doctrine is not dead, and the warmth of Mr. Shi's advocacy of national products must be continued and carried forward by those of us who are still alive to comfort Mr. Shi's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>Talking About National Products</p>
<h3 id="e26">Let's Build a Mentality of Loving and Using National Products <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Taishun</p>
<p>The voice of promoting national products has now been heard by almost everyone: opening the newspaper, there are texts promoting national products every day; national products organizations are also thinking about ways to encourage the use of national products all day long; ladies and gentlemen who are enthusiastic about national products in society are also making various national products promotions at any time with parched lips and tongues; however, the facts are in front of us, and in the past six months, the country's money has still been flowing out drop by drop. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>If we want to save the country wholeheartedly, and if we want to stop the leakage of money, we must first see how other countries perished. In the past, those who destroyed other people's countries used politics or military affairs, but now it is not always the case. The most recent weapon to destroy other people's countries is a deadly economy; economics is really a gun, a cannon, and poisonous gas that kills people without shedding blood. We see one East India Company that can end the huge country of India. From this, we can infer that we are really not afraid of guns, cannons, and poisonous gas. We are not afraid of elite troops. What we really need to be afraid of is the beautiful and attractive foreign goods that squeeze our beloved people's wealth and blood!</p>
<p>If we want money not to overflow, of course, Chinese people must love and use Chinese goods, and fight against foreign goods. If money does not flow out, the country's economy will naturally be very prosperous. But it is strange to say that we know that using foreign goods is enough to destroy other people's countries, so why does the report of the International Trade Bureau still show an increase in import surplus? Why is it that the food and clothing of the Chinese people are still mostly foreign goods? I think there must still be thousands of people with the following eight mentalities:</p>
<p>(1) Using foreign goods is beautiful, and it can show my wealth, fashion, modernity, and ease.</p>
<p>(2) What does my individual use of foreign goods have to do with the national economy, let alone the survival of the country.</p>
<p>(3) Even if there are substitutes for foreign goods, they claim that they are purchased only out of necessity.</p>
<p>(4) When it is discovered that they have recently bought foreign goods from foreign stores, they claim that they were bought in the past.</p>
<p>(5) Others are using foreign goods, so I might as well imitate them.</p>
<p>(6) Those who are afraid of losing their status by using national products have to wear a set of national products clothes to cover up when there is a gathering.</p>
<p>(7) Foreign goods are cheaper and of better quality than Chinese goods, so why should I buy expensive and inferior Chinese goods.</p>
<p>(8) I cannot distinguish between Chinese and foreign goods. As long as they fit my material desires, they are all good.</p>
<p>If the Chinese people have the above eight mentalities, how can national products have hope of getting out of trouble, and how can the national economy have a prosperous day? We should start from today. All those who have a patriotic heart must grit their teeth and take responsibility to work hard, work hard, and work until everyone loves and uses national products, feels that using foreign goods is a shame, and using national products is an honor. Gradually, we should eliminate the mentality of using foreign goods and build a mentality of loving and using national products. Based on the mentality of loving and using national products, we should start from our own families, and slowly spread it to all compatriots in the country. Everyone should put it into practice, so that it is as if we have built a solid fortress, and even if foreign goods with beautiful faces come to attack and lure us, we will absolutely not fall for their tricks. But how should we build a mentality of loving and using national products? At least three conditions must be met:</p>
<p>(1) Self-confidence and self-esteem We trust that we are patriotic citizens. We must first fundamentally understand the advantages and disadvantages of using foreign goods and national products, and believe that loving and using national products is unique, and buying foreign goods is base and shameless. The most glorious and prestigious thing in the world is the use of national products. Creating a love for national products is the secret to increasing prestige, and everyone will respect him.</p>
<p>(2) Despise Westernization We should respect those who love and use national products. On the other hand, we should despise those who wear foreign goods. From now on, if there are Westernized people coming, we will scoff at them and avoid them. Over time, those who use foreign goods may feel ashamed and change their habits.</p>
<p>(3) Strive for self-improvement Foreign goods are a weapon to destroy other people's countries, so we should immediately turn around, strive for self-improvement, start from now, cherish our money, and set our goals to do the patriotic work of loving and using national products.</p>

<h3 id="e27">How to Avoid "Intra-Industry Competitive Selling" <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>——A Major Issue Facing National Products</p>
<p>At present, if we talk about the issue of national products, no one will forget the two sharp knives that destroy the life of national products and hinder the progress of national products - one is foreign goods from abroad, and the other is the products produced by foreign factories in China, which are considered to be the objects that urgently need to be eliminated for the future development of national products. However, aside from this, who knows that, on the other hand, national products factories themselves are also "drinking poison to quench their thirst", suffering from an extremely serious terminal illness, whose crisis and impact is really "more than" the former two. This is - "intra-industry competitive selling". Originally, this evil demon, at present, with the economic panic and the downturn in the market, is extremely active in the current national products industry, which is worth discussing.</p>
<p>We know that "intra-industry competitive selling", although it is said to be an inevitable thing under intense commercial warfare and free trade, however, in our country, because there are no reasonable sanctions and the concept of selfishness among Chinese people is too deep, regardless of the overall plan, its rampantness is increasingly out of control. Recently, because of the drought in the south and the flood in the north, the whole country is suffering from disasters, the rural economy is accelerating its collapse, and purchasing power is weakening day by day, which affects the decline in sales of national products, resulting in overproduction, so prices are falling more and more. Moreover, it also manufactures substandard goods to cater to customers' psychology, which confuses, darkens and disrupts the market. As far as I know, at present, there are already a few emerging industries whose selling prices are even lower than the cost price, not to mention others. This phenomenon and this situation is a big problem in the future of revitalizing national products, and it must be solved quickly. Now, I dare to offer my opinion and list the two steps of temporary treatment below:</p>
<p>(1) Set Prices First, various trade associations should quickly convene a general meeting of members, discuss and agree on price regulations, abide by them together, and have each factory submit a certificate of deposit and publicly disclose the sales accounts, so that the association can check them at any time. If there is any violation, the certificate of deposit will be confiscated.</p>
<p>(2) Eliminate Substandard Goods Cutting corners and selling substandard goods is also a way for the national products industry to decline on its own. In this crisis, the association must notify all factories to urgently eliminate them, no longer manufacture them, and strive to reduce the cost of genuine goods and lower the selling price to benefit the public.</p>
<p>Although, the fundamental solution lies in the self-awareness and thorough feeling of the national products industry itself, we must know that "intra-industry competition" is tantamount to a "suicide policy", especially in the era when China's industry is still in its infancy. This "mutual trampling" will inevitably "hurt both sides", and "the snipe and clam fight", the Western fishermen are showing their ferocious smiles and intensifying their work, trying to profit from it.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Suggestions for Organizing a National Products Propaganda Team <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Students Use Spare Time on Weekends</p>
<p>To Conduct In-Depth Propaganda in Rural Villages</p>
<p>Promoting national products and using national products is very easy to shout out, but putting it into practice is the opposite of very easy, and becomes very difficult. Therefore, whether it is the National Products Year or the Women's National Products Year, foreign goods still flow in like water; and our country's money? It flows out like water: although it is the same flow, foreigners flow with smiles, while Chinese people? On the contrary, they flow with sallow faces and thin bodies, frowning and glaring! Under this situation, of course, we must reverse the flow of money outward, so that it flows upstream and into the pockets of our Chinese people!</p>
<p>Anyone knows that promoting national products is the responsibility and obligation of citizens, but why is it that promoting national products does not work? Why is there still a leakage of tens of millions of yuan every year? Is the heart of the Chinese people really dead? Is the blood of the Chinese people really cold? I don't think so; because 80-90% of Chinese people have not received education, and if people who have not received education are not explained to them, how do they know to promote national products? Moreover, even those who have received education cannot recognize whether goods are national products or not, so that they are deceived. This is also a common occurrence. Therefore, I think we need to expand propaganda, and we need oral propaganda—oral propaganda and written propaganda, both are equally important, because oral propaganda is propaganda for illiterate people, and written propaganda is propaganda for literate people, so neither can be abandoned. —The purpose of propaganda is (1) to promote the meaning of national products; (2) to distinguish the common sense of national products; for the propagandists of oral propaganda, it is best to ask students to serve. Because they can use their spare time on weekends to organize "National Products Propaganda Teams" to go deep into the people and into the countryside to carry out propaganda. I think: this will definitely receive great results! I hope that students from all schools will come to serve this kind of propaganda work, so that the Women's National Products Year will achieve final victory!</p>

<h3 id="e29">Domestic Goods in Wenzhou <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Feng</p>
<p>(Wenzhou Correspondence) Wenzhou, in the eyes of the average person, may seem like a place not worth paying attention to. But in terms of cigarettes alone, the annual consumption reaches about three to four million yuan.</p>
<p>Wenzhou used to have six counties, sometimes referred to as the six counties of Wenzhou, and that's from an administrative point of view. However, from a commercial point of view, Wenzhou actually includes the six counties belonging to the upper reaches of the Ou River (Chuzhou). So, although Wenzhou is a small trading port, its total import and export trade is still sufficient to occupy a considerable position among China's trading ports.</p>
<p>According to past years' statistics, Wenzhou's trade has always been in deficit. This is because Wenzhou's production exports are small each year, while the imports of consumables are large. Among these many consumables, there are two conditions that meet the psychological requirements of the people of Wenzhou:</p>
<p>First, the price must be cheap:</p>
<p>Second, the designs must be novel.</p>
<p>There are indeed domestic goods that meet the above two conditions, but there are definitely not many of them. Moreover, when foreign goods are being dumped in our country on a large scale, how many things in the market can compete with foreign goods after all? Therefore, the future of domestic goods in Wenzhou is bound to have little hope.</p>
<p>At present, for the sake of implementing the New Life Movement, the general public is temporarily stirred by enthusiasm, and organizations such as anti-Japanese associations and domestic goods promotion associations are emerging in response. At the same time, the Shanghai China National Products Company has also established a large store of China National Products Company in Wenzhou as a branch, and it actually officially opened on October 10th. Mr. Wang Zhenfang and Mr. Wang Xingyao were sent from Shanghai to Wenzhou to provide guidance. It is said that recent business has been developing very well. What will happen in the future? Of course, I cannot be dogmatic. But if prices can be cheap and designs can be novel, if such things are sold in large quantities at the Wenzhou China National Products Company, then I can guarantee that this company will definitely be able to exist permanently in Wenzhou. Otherwise, five minutes will pass, and the Wenzhou China National Products Company may also pass with those five minutes!</p>
<p>Blue cloth shirts were once all the rage in Wenzhou, but what about now? This is enough to prove what the future holds for domestic goods in Wenzhou!</p>

<h3 id="e30">A Record of the Opening of the National Goods Exhibition in Penglai Market <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The opening of the 6th National Goods Movement Conference of this city on the anniversary of the birth of Premier Sun Yat-sen has two meanings: (1) to commemorate the sage who created the Republic of China, and (2) to hope that all compatriots in the country will follow the Premier's nation-building plan and strive for material construction in order to save the dying national economy. This is also good news within the Women's National Goods Year. I am recording what I have seen in this publication, hoping it will be noted by comrades who promote national goods.</p>
<p>The venue is located in the Penglai Night Garden at the south end of Penglai Market, Xiaoximen, in this city. A towering pine and cypress archway is erected at the entrance. After signing in, guests are given the "China National Goods Survey Booklet" compiled by the Shanghai National Goods Introduction and Reporting Office, and the "Special Issue" published by the conference, for reference. One lists the trademarks and addresses of domestic goods factories, and the other details the various purposes and methods of promoting domestic goods, both of which are useful publications in the domestic goods industry. On the stage is a large cream cake donated by Taikang Company, more than a foot in diameter, decorated with the eight characters "Patriotic People Advocate National Goods", and stating "Respectfully Presented by Taikang Company", all made of sugar, containing artistic ideas and also advertising properties, which can be described as doing everything possible to promote. The stage is covered with chrysanthemums planted by the Municipal Garden, colorful and exceptionally beautiful. The four walls are plastered with slogans such as "Promoting domestic goods is the fundamental way to resist economic aggression" and "Using domestic goods is the only way out for the Chinese nation." China Pharmaceutical Salt Factory is distributing its products on the spot, saying that regular use of medicinal salt can prevent illness. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, reported on the purpose of the conference, dividing the amount of money flowing out this year due to the habit of using foreign goods into different categories, detailing them completely, saying that countries around the world are striving to develop commerce, dumping their surplus goods into our country, exchanging our money for the manufacture of weapons, speaking painfully, hoping that all compatriots across the country will quickly wake up and switch to using domestic goods in order to plug the leaks, and also hoping that manufacturers will strive to improve the quality of domestic goods and lower prices in order to counter foreign goods and save profits, his words were earnest and moving. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, said that the city holds a national goods movement conference once a year, pessimists say that the customs trade book is still in deficit, which does not help, and only wastes money to join the fun, optimists say that through this reminder, the number of people who like to use foreign goods and switch to domestic goods is increasing day by day, which is of some help to various domestic goods factories, advising domestic goods manufacturers to intensify their publicity efforts, and citing the visit to a certain cloth factory in Wuxi, where they learned that there are also such fine and beautiful fabrics among domestic goods, as proof. Ms. Lin Kecong wore a blue silk cheongsam on the day and gave a speech citing the story of a British cloth factory asking women to buy a cloth skirt each to maintain the livelihoods of workers, and advised Shanghai women to switch to domestic goods as a guide for women across the country, her words were quite sincere. Wang Jie'an of the China National Goods Maintenance Association spoke in the soft language of Wu Nong, comparing imported goods to national goods as grand cuisine to home-cooked meals, advising compatriots across the country not to go to grand restaurants every day to eat grand cuisine, resulting in bankruptcy, but rather to eat home-cooked meals at home to preserve family property, gesticulating while speaking, vivid and lively, like a storyteller, winning a lot of applause. The temporary commercial market is located on the open space in the western part of Penglai Market, with as many as 139 participating manufacturers, with all kinds of goods available. Because it was not ready on this day, the opening was changed to the next day.</p>
<p>New News from the Domestic Goods Industry in a Week</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Smilingly Meet and Greet, Lighting Lamps to Illuminate Withered Faces, Hungry Stomachs Drive One to Apply Powder and Learn Flirtation</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Hu curled her lips and said: "Oh! What are you boasting about? My family certainly doesn't have West Gate water, and your family may not have it either, right? This is other people's water, you're taking advantage of it, working here and having it to drink every day..." As she said this, she saw the Class A tea room attendant's face turn red, so she changed her smile and said: "I'm just joking with you, don't be angry." As she spoke, she took another cup and poured a bowl of tea, sending it to him, and laughed: "Let me return the favor with a cup." The tea room attendant wanted to keep a straight face, but couldn't, and could only smile. The Class B tea room attendant held his arms in his chest and laughed: "Sister-in-law Hu, you're being unfair." Before Sister-in-law Hu could say the second sentence, she had already poured two more cups of tea and sent them to his hands. The Class B tea room attendant took the tea and bowed slightly to her, laughing: "Sister-in-law Hu really does things powerfully, making people neither cry nor laugh." Sister-in-law Hu sighed and said: "It's not shameful to curry favor with you two, poor people should always be extra good to each other." The Class B tea room attendant laughed at the Class A tea room attendant: "Did you hear that, our Sister-in-law Hu has already built a low foundation here, and when something happens, she wants us to put in a good word." Before the Class A tea room attendant could finish speaking, Sister-in-law Hu just kept pursing her lips and winking at the two of them. When the two of them looked outside the room, it turned out that it was the two gentlemen, Zhang and Li, who had returned. Their faces were full of smiles, but not like usual. When the tea room attendant rushed to open the door, another gentleman in a long robe came in behind them. He took two steps, but looked back, and laughed: "Just come in, what's the rush?" As he spoke, he waved his hand inside. At this time, a woman in her early twenties came in, wearing a blue soft satin cheongsam, with white braids along the edges. Her black hair was slightly curled, only behind her head, obviously permed by an incompetent hairdresser. She had a long face, large eyes, and a high nose. Although she had black bangs, red rouge, and white face powder, the gaunt flesh on her cheeks could not be made more plump no matter what. (70)</p>

<p>The German writer Leeson was extremely careless. One night, he returned home and knocked on the door to enter. His maidservant, mistaking him for someone else, replied: "Sir! The master hasn't returned yet." Leeson replied: "It doesn't matter, I'll come back tomorrow"! Saying that, he left on his own.</p>
<p>During the Spring and Autumn Period, there was a fool in the State of Lu who, when moving house, actually forgot his wife. This person had the same forgetfulness as the German Leeson.</p>
<p>But to bring the topic back; aren't there many people in the world who, for the sake of money, beauty, and power, bustle about until death without realizing it, forgetting themselves? Why should they laugh at others!</p>
<h3 id="e33">Talking About Crab Paintings <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Shiyuan</p>
<p>It is unknown when crab painting began in China. Roughly since the Song and Yuan dynasties, the style of painting from life became popular. Famous painters, in addition to figures and landscapes, often also painted insects and fish, and crabs were of course one of their subjects for painting from life. However, not many have been handed down to later generations, not as many as Emperor Huizong's eagles or Zhao Ziang's horses, which are almost everywhere. Twenty years ago, when I accompanied the embassy to France, I saw a Chinese crab painting in the Louvre in Paris, which was quite meticulous, with ancient paper and no signature, but with the seal of the imperial collection, probably a work of the Yuan or Ming dynasty, said to have been plundered by the Allied Forces during the Boxer Rebellion. In the early years of the Republic of China, I saw several small albums by Bai Yangshanren in Yuan Xiangcheng's staff, one of which was a painting of a crab, with unrestrained brushwork, truly a masterpiece, with a poem that said: "Crawling all night without ten feet, the world still says it walks sideways." It was also expressed with a purpose. Later, in an antique shop in Liulichang, I saw a painting of a crab by Zeng Yandong, with simple brushwork and sufficient spirit, inscribed: "See when you will walk sideways?" According to the owner of the shop, Zeng Yandong was forced to paint by his superiors when he was a county magistrate, and he made this satire, and was later offended because of it. During the Tongzhi reign, Zhao Beian traveled to Jian'ou as a staff member, and there were many strange marine products by the sea. Beian once painted a crab picture, with as many as twenty different kinds of crabs, from large horse crabs to small sand crabs, inscribed: "One crab is not as good as another crab." Beian's paintings were far superior to his calligraphy, but the world rarely knew it. Among contemporary painters who like to paint crabs, I admire Ma Mengrong the most, his brushwork is elegant, and he has both talent and skill. Several years ago, at an exhibition in Shanghai, I saw one of his crabs, with a poem by Ma Gongyu: "Marching in formation, wearing armor and wielding spears, originally without a belly or intestines, letting you walk sideways in the rivers and seas, you will eventually accompany orange and ginger at the wine table," which was a lament for the warlords of the time who held troops and walked sideways, and ridiculed them. Recently, I saw another crab by Mengrong, with a poem by Ma Gongyu: "It's another day to hold crabs and admire chrysanthemums, recalling the days when we composed poems and painted together, Rongzhai is desolate and suddenly a year has passed, and reading this picture makes tears surge forth!" I heard that Mengrong returned to the mountain not long after January 28th, and I did not have the chance to meet him, which I still regret. (Not for payment)</p>
<p>(Du Juan notes, Mengrong's crab paintings are naturally the work of an old wheelwright. However, what I have in my collection are only two works, a cuckoo singing on a cuckoo branch and a wisteria. I regret that I cannot raise Mengrong from the ground and beg him for a painting of a gutless gentleman. Thinking about it makes my stomach ache!)</p>
<h3 id="e34">A Day's Pleasure <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>As usual: October! October in the lunar calendar can be considered the season of joy in the countryside. Because at that time, the grain is piled on the threshing floor, the rice is stored in the granary, and cotton and beans, etc., are exchanged for money or used by oneself. The problem of hunger and cold for a year can almost be solved; then, the previous "hundred days of labor" should be compensated with "a day's pleasure" to provide spiritual adjustment. Therefore, every October, people in the countryside, regardless of men, women, old or young, always have a component of joy on their expressions. However, what about now? Isn't it also October, the joyful season? But I will temporarily set aside the current reality and first describe them based on memories! Let the farmers recall the old images of happiness. I think this will be enough for the farmers to reminisce and chew on, especially in the current situation.</p>
<p>This is naturally a superstitious act; but farmers have no chance to go to the cinema to watch movies, let alone qualify to go to the dance hall to dance or to the golf course to play golf. Of course, they can only seek the joy they need from traditional superstitious fantasies. Therefore, a picture of farmers having fun in October in the lunar calendar is nothing more than two ways: "going out to meetings" and "doing societies"; and these two ways of having fun are both centered on welcoming gods. First, let's talk about "going out to meetings": going out to meetings is also called "competition meetings", which is to take the idol they believe in the most, gather many people to be in charge of flags, drums, and all the necessary ceremonies, and carry the idol to patrol each village for a day or more; when the village receives the idol, it must entertain the people in the meeting, and everyone takes this opportunity to chat. Therefore, not only are the people in the meeting happy at that time, but also the villagers who have no relationship, because they can take this opportunity to "watch the meeting", so they are all happy, which can simply be called "everyone is happy". As for "doing societies", the scope is smaller than "going out to meetings". When doing societies, only a few to dozens of families are united as "society friends", and a kind of idol is also entertained in the "society head's" house. At the same time, it is also a feast for the society friends to slaughter pigs and sheep; this kind of doing society contains the meaning of thanking for the harvest and praying for a good year. In fact, this is nothing more than "a hundred days of labor, a day's pleasure".</p>
<p>The above—going out to meetings and doing societies are of course superstitious acts, because they are superstitious acts, they should be eliminated and prohibited. But in this year when the countryside has gone bankrupt, they—the farmers work hard and toil to cultivate the land for a year, and as a result, in addition to suffering from natural and man-made disasters, they also have to pay rent and grain, which is not enough to eat a full meal or wear a warm coat: it is about to be discarded in ditches and scattered in all directions, where is there any surplus or spare money? To seek the enjoyment of this "a day's pleasure"! Therefore, this kind of superstitious act has long been unnecessary to eliminate or prohibit, and has been eliminated and prohibited by itself.</p>

<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>The evening sun in late autumn is too good, faintly reddening the new gravel road. A skinny horse pulls a broken cart, and we sit on the broken cart, without using our waists and feet; the scenery of the mountains and fields will naturally flow into our eyes. The smell of horse manure at the pavilion gate and the annoying tone of the car夫 soliciting business are no longer heard, and the Liuyuan Garden with its white walls also slips past. Pointing to the west, the lush green Jiechuang Law Temple on the left really looks like a riverside mountain village scene in the deep summer of Switzerland.</p>
<p>There are wide grasslands here, bordering the rice fields. Looking at a carriage jumping in the dust ten feet away in front, we can imagine the autumn harvest scene in New Zealand. Sometimes three or five young military officers come galloping face to face like a race, and it will slightly cut through this quiet and indifferent realm, revealing an embarrassing disturbance. Really, I, who have always been accustomed to a comfortable life, do not envy command knives and medals. To be able to "pick chrysanthemums under the eastern fence and leisurely see the southern mountains," I cherish this "leisurely" feeling very much.</p>
<p>The coachman sits on the high pad pulling the reins, whipping the skinny horse again and again. Although there is a little regret, seeing the setting sun in the west and many Jiangbei children running and bowing behind the car to beg us for money, we feel calm after throwing some more copper coins.</p>
<p>The wind blows across our faces in the sunlight; there is already a hint of winter news. Pulling up our collars, we shiver and secretly recite the line: "The weather is already cool but not cold." Raising our eyes, we see a beautiful spire again on the distant Haitong mountain peak, silently exquisite, leaning against the clear autumn sky.</p>
<p>The riverside Shantang town also gradually falls into the cart canopy, and we get off the cart on a barren field under a stone bridge.</p>
<p>Tiger Hill is originally a mound, no more than one hundred and thirty feet high. Anyone who travels around will never develop a lover-like attachment to it; however, for me, although I have loved Tiantai, Yandang, Kuanglu, and Huangshan; at the same time, I also love a corner of the mountain and a shore of the water. I feel that Tiger Hill, like Yuantouzhu, is exquisite, quiet, and clean, like a quiet and virtuous female scholar. As before, in the dusk after a rain in mid-June, you step on the mountain steps paved with bricks and stones, and the verdant atmosphere on both sides flows out with a faint fragrance, so fresh that it sweetly intoxicates your heart, this is the characteristic of Tiger Hill. Moreover, the area is not large, and the structure is the most compact, with no gaps anywhere, but there is no place that is not high, refreshing, and magical.</p>
<p>We slipped into the mountain gate and walked up step by step. A little girl selling white orchids followed us step by step, wanting us to buy a few arrows from her. I fundamentally hate those turbid and strong fragrances, and shake my head at her, indicating that I don't want them, but she says in a pleading tone:</p>
<p>"Sir, buy Nu's arrow of flowers, three copper coins!"</p>
<p>That's right, she sells flowers for money, so I took out the copper coins and threw them into her flower basket, and explained to her why I didn't want that kind of annoyingly fragrant flower. However, she seemed embarrassed: "Then I'll lead you up!" she said. At that time, I felt that the unease that this person felt far exceeded what I felt. But I decided to decline her:</p>
<p>"No need to lead, we often come here to drink tea." I jumped onto the Tiger Hill shop with a reed shed. Then, I darted towards Lengxiang Pavilion. When I looked back on the stone steps, the little girl was hesitantly staring into the flower basket. My heart was heavy!.</p>
<p>Leaning on the stone railing, I roughly looked at the distant and near peaks, the clouds, smoke, bamboo, and trees at my feet, and then returned along the winding path lined with privet and green trees, passed the Dashe Guanyin Hall, and slipped down to see the Third Spring. This place is very similar to the Huanglong Cave of Kuanglu, but without a waterfall. Further down is the Jianchi, floating with a pool of duckweed-green spring water, without the meaning of "windy ravines and cloud springs". Looking up, there is a woman in red clothes walking over the stone bridge of the double buckets, which happens to be set off by the green vines and green leaves hanging in the two ravines. This figure is very small, truly a graceful and elegant painting. From here, proceed left on the remaining steps, walk past the Shuang Diaotong Bridge, and on that open space with weeds, the dilapidated Tiger Hill Pagoda stands on the right, and the strong and fresh Hufuge Pavilion sits on the left. In the wind window behind the Hufuge Pavilion, peering at the surrounding rice paddies, mountain trees, houses, fishermen, red frost maples, yellow tallow trees, and also mixed with unknown wild flowers of various colors under Haitong Peak, it is really very beautiful.

<h3 id="e37">Records of Fragrant Incense Drifting <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The candles used here are all very, very large, perhaps specially made, but in our eyes, accustomed to electric lights, the light is still very dim. Under this right-angled corridor, there are ten hanging on each of the three sides, but their hanging method is very special, which I have never seen before. Because what I have often seen before is either inserted into a candlestick on a table or hung on a candlestick on a wall, but here all lanterns are used. Lanterns are not a rare thing in themselves, I have seen thousands and hundreds of kinds of paper-covered and glass-encrusted ones, but I have never seen lanterns made of things like ox horns, and these horn lanterns are all made very thin, almost as transparent as glass. The products of Chinese handicrafts often have miracles that cannot be conceived by machinery, and this kind of horn lantern is an example.</p>
<p>The color of all the candles is bright red—other colors are considered unlucky, and of course, absolutely cannot be used. Each one is about a foot and a half long, which cannot be considered small, but the lantern itself is not very big, just enough to hold this candle. So I think it must be very difficult and dangerous to light it at first, and it may burn the lantern; but the eunuchs here have developed a very good technique, not only is it not difficult at all to light it at first, but there will never be any burning of the lantern—at least, during the few days I stayed in Fengtian, there never was. At the top of this horn lamp, three points are connected by a copper chain: in this way, the lamp can be stabilized. And at the end where these three copper chains are combined, there is also a copper hook. After the lamp wax is burning brightly, use this hook to hang it on the beam under the corridor, so that it hangs high. (180)</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Cripple (by Zsigmond Móricz) <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Uncle Zhuang</p>
<p>Zsigmond Móricz is one of the most notable modern Hungarian authors. He excels at writing about the joyful countryside and simple, honest farmers. This short story effectively showcases his distinctive style. – Translator's note.</p>
<p>We arrived in the middle of the village.</p>
<p>Around us lay boundless wasteland. The plains were so uniform that we could only see the clear line of the horizon and the entire arc of the sky. In the exceptionally clear sky, large clouds floated, like joyful flags, bundles upon bundles of beautiful silk, hanging above you...</p>
<p>But my friend, he wasn't looking at the sky; his eyes, stern and cold, were fixed only on the ground. This land was his, about a thousand "acres" (approximately eight thousand mu - translator).</p>
<p>"It's such a nuisance!" he said. "It's such a nuisance to cultivate a thousand acres of land in this day and age! The value of agricultural products is at rock bottom, while the value of industrial goods is sky-high. People borrowed money, thinking they could easily repay it because wheat could sell for thirty-six 'pengos' (Hungarian currency - translator), but now wheat only sells for six 'pengos,' and the debt remains the same..."</p>
<p>He idly dug at the soil with his walking stick, this same soil that once yielded wheat worth thirty-six "pengos," just as fertile as before.</p>
<p>"What troubles you most are those damned short-term laborers. All they know is how to strike and demand higher wages... they don't care even if I lose money."</p>
<p>Resentfully, he sank back into his thoughts, then continued:</p>
<p>"But this year, I won't let those bastards make trouble. Last winter, I arranged it so that I only kept three and a half people. All the work is done by these three and a half people."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"It's very simple... In the autumn, I had them plow the land and sow wheat and rye. The rest, I leave to heaven to complete... As for livestock, I sold off the excess because I didn't have enough fodder stored up, and I certainly wasn't foolish enough to buy more. Besides, livestock is much cheaper to buy now than in the fall. I can now buy the livestock I need at a bargain price, so much so that it's hard to choose. In the winter, three people are more than enough to tend to the livestock and clean the livestock sheds."</p>

<p>Finance - Major Players Sway the Market</p>
<p>Margin Calls Scatter, Causing Volatility</p>
<p>Market Initially Firm, Suddenly Weakens, Falling by Nine Yuan and Eight Jiao</p>
<p>After the previous day's sharp rise in the gold market, the market opened firm yesterday. However, due to heavy selling pressure from major players and a lack of sustained buying support, coupled with a weak currency market and short selling, the market weakened after an initially firm morning. As a result, it fell, scattering many leveraged positions taken by those who followed the upward trend. The overall trend now appears to be easier to fall than rise. The rumors circulating the previous day completely dissipated today, and the trend slightly weakened. The morning opened with overseas silver markets showing a slight decrease in London and no change in the US. Forward silver prices, however, rose by 2.5%. London gold prices were also unchanged. Exchange rates rose. Reports indicated that the new Belgian cabinet had been formed and would strive to maintain the gold standard, suggesting that the gold bloc would not collapse. Reuters Washington reported that the leader of the pro-silver faction in the US, Wheeler, advocated for the free coinage of silver to achieve a gold-silver ratio of sixteen to one. However, Jin (Gwynne?) opposed any further silver legislation in the next Congress. The pre-market trading opened higher, rising to 0.067 yuan. However, this was still slightly lower than the closing price the previous day. Investor sentiment seemed cautious but generally positive, and the situation appeared favorable. Unexpectedly, heavy selling by major players frightened buyers. Prices moved higher and then lower. The official exchange rates announced by the Central Bank remained unchanged. The morning opened with a lower price. After the opening, major players continued to supply the market, pushing prices below the 1,000 yuan level. At this time, market sentiment was not entirely discouraged, and there was still some recovery. However, banks seized the opportunity to aggressively sell, pushing the currency market even lower. The gold market weakened. Some bargain hunting helped to stabilize the market. Banks briefly bought forward US dollars, leading to some rebound, but the subsequent decline was easy. Trading was relatively calm at this point. The silver equalization tax was announced and remained unchanged. Dealers sought to balance supply and demand, leading to erratic price fluctuations. The situation appeared quite uncertain, but the overall trend was mediocre. The underlying trend still seemed positive, so small investors continued to buy, and major players also added to their positions. Prices rebounded to nine yuan. However, the banks' appetite remained poor, and they continued to sell. The currency market continued to weaken. Supply briefly exceeded demand, and the overall market weakened again. Margin calls caused widespread panic. The afternoon saw a slight stabilization after the decline. The market showed signs of weakness. The spot market remained weak due to a lack of buyers, falling to parity with the margin price. Here is a record of the morning market:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1,002 yuan, down 2.8 jiao from the previous close. Da Fa Yong, Ren Fa, Yong Hui Xiang, Xiang Feng, Fu Tai Heng, Fu Xing Yong, and Tong Fu all sold, causing a drop to 998 yuan. Shun Mao, Heng Yu, Fu Xing Yong, and Lai Jin bought, pushing the price up to 1,000 yuan and 8 jiao. Hua Bi offered December and January US dollars at 1.875. Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Chang Yong, Zheng Chang Heng Yu, etc., sold at 997 yuan and 7 jiao. Da Fa Yong, Bing Xing, Na Tiao (contract), rose to 9 yuan, but February US dollars at 2.5, despite being sold, Fu Xing Yong Heng Yu Heng Xing Yuan Yong Li sold out, gradually falling to 4 yuan and 5 jiao. Anticipating the announcement of HSBC's exchange rate as unchanged for British currency and up 0.0625 for US currency, market sentiment was stable. Fu Yu, Da Lian Gang, Da Fa Yong Fu Xing Yong, Hong Xing, etc., still bought, rising to 7 yuan. He Lan offered December US dollars at 3.75. Zheng Chang, Fu Tai Heng, Hong Kang Yong Heng Xing offered contracts, causing a drop to 4 yuan and 5 jiao. Fu Xing Yong Yong Li Heng Yu suddenly rushed to buy, raising the price to 8 yuan and 8 jiao. Due to the rapid rebound, sellers remained eager. Da Fa Yong Heng Yu Hui Xiang sold, and the price fell to 6 yuan and 3 jiao. HSBC suddenly bought March US dollars at 3.125, boosting market sentiment. Qian Chang Xiang Heng Chang Yong Jin went to 8 yuan and above. Fu Xing Yong Yuan Mao Yong Da Fa Yong Lai sold, and the price fell again to 4 yuan. Later, Da Lian Gang sold contracts, while Heng Xing and Fu Xing Yong bought. At this time, the silver equalization tax was announced, remaining at 6.75%, unchanged from the previous day. The major market events hovered between 5 and 6 yuan. Due to limited trading, Jing Qing Yu Tian Feng Yong Yuan Chun and other small investors bought, and the price rose to 7 yuan and 5 jiao. Da De Cheng Fu Xing Yong sold, falling back to 5 yuan and 6 jiao. Subsequently, short covering Yuan Chang Yong Fu Yu Tian Feng Heng Yu also bought, briefly rising to 9 yuan. Shun Mao Zheng Chang Da Lian Gang Qian Chang Xiang Yong Feng Tong Chun, etc., continued to sell contracts. Banks continued to sell January US dollars at 3.75, gradually falling to 3 yuan and 3 jiao. Da De Cheng Fu Xing Yong Da Fa Yong, etc., bought at the low, and then rose again to 5 yuan and above. Shortly after, Mitsui resold January US dollars at 4.375. Fu An Hui Xiang Yi Feng Yong Fu Xing Yong, etc., sold to 3 yuan. Heng Yu Da Fa Yong Yuan Mao Yong Qing Yu Heng Chang Yong then bought, rising again to 5 yuan and above. Fluctuating below, the afternoon ended at 995 yuan. After the close, Fu Yu Ding Kang Lai sold, causing a small decline. Market sentiment remained good. Heng Yu Da De Cheng Lai bought, and the price finally rose to 5 yuan and 7 to 8 jiao. The highest price during the half-day was 1,002 yuan, and the lowest was 993 yuan, a difference of 9 yuan. The result was a decrease of 9 yuan and 8 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Settlement was based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, still calculated at 1,005 yuan and 4 jiao. According to the closing price, it was about 10 yuan lower, slightly more than 10 yuan lower than the previous close. The registered price for February was 992 yuan, and for January was 995 yuan. The morning call money was 992 yuan. Pure gold was at parity with the margin price, with a posted price of 1,002 yuan. In this time of tight silver credit, spot goods lacked buyers, resulting in no transactions. Although the price of Tianjin goods seemed to trend toward parity on the surface, it was still likely to require an additional 2 yuan. There were no formal transactions reported in the half-day, and the overall trend was extremely weak. There were no swap transactions reported. Short positions held firm, and buyers remained fearful. The discount widened, but it was still difficult to find a counterparty. In terms of spot goods, a premium of about 8 yuan was generally required, but there were no transactions. Rumors that cash restrictions would be lifted had the opposite effect on the spot market.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was disorganized. Overall, Yi Feng Yong Fu Tai Heng Tong Tai Chang Tong Chun Ding Kang Yi Cheng Yuan Mao Yong Tian Feng Yuan Chun Heng Tai Heng Chang Yong Tong Fu Sheng Da Heng Xing Yuan Zheng Chang, etc., were the sellers.

The Chinese merchants' psychology then turned weak. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced and remained unchanged. However, because the banks lowered prices and increased the supply, the process gradually hardened. Chinese merchants lacked buying appetite, and the selling atmosphere was warm and even harder. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official exchange rate was announced, the British pound was flat and the US dollar rose 0.0625, also because of the exchange rate. In order to stabilize the market, Ken Ding Bank tried to push up prices. Forward US dollar potential tightened. After entering, the silver balance tax was announced unchanged, still levied at 6.75 percent. At this time, the market situation was extremely calm, but the overall supply exceeded demand.

<p>Securities - Bulls Emerge in Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Sixth Issue of Public Bonds Fell by One Yuan, the Largest Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange. Due to the continued increase in foreign borrowing rates, the environment did not bring positive news, and the settlement period was approaching, triggering the emergence of bulls from major players, forming a bull squeeze, and the downtrend was very severe. Throughout the day, the trend did not change. Because the overnight rate was higher in the afternoon, once as high as 26 cents, the trend of foreign borrowing rates may increase again. In the market, the 30th, 41st, and 50th issues were the largest to emerge, while the 4th issue took the opportunity to cover short positions at low prices. The future situation may continue to decline because the bulls have not been fully cleared. The situation yesterday was completely downtrending, with the situation getting worse. The closing was slightly stable due to temporary short covering. The opening in the morning was slightly loose, and the downtrend was even more severe in the second session due to the continued emergence of major players. After the afternoon opening, the downtrend did not stop. Throughout the day, the sixth issue of public bonds was the most severely downtrending, with a drop of one yuan. The rest also fell by two, three, seven, or eight jiao. Predicting the situation, due to the approaching settlement period and the increase in foreign borrowing rates, the bulls still need to emerge, so it is not yet optimistic. The closing time was half past six, and the total transaction volume was not sorted out, estimated at about 30 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Rises and Falls Without Difference</p>
<p>According to the report of Xinfeng Foreign Firm, yesterday (20th), the New York stock market was mixed due to the sharp drop in wheat and the loosening of goods. Many companies announced dividends today, including Rowdell Department Store, which issued a dividend of half a yuan, which has some help to the stocks of these companies, but has little impact on the overall market situation. Traders know that this kind of dividend is paid from the public reserve fund rather than from profits, which is already commonplace. Public utility stocks were still sold off today, and several stocks hit new lows. Some people in Washington are promoting legislation to force the coinage of silver, but silver stocks are only flat. Steel stocks rebounded after falling due to favorable news in the industry. The bond market was mixed and slightly lower. Small exchange stocks fell. Chicago wheat fell due to the domestic weather report being favorable for short positions and the weakness of the foreign market. A total of 870,000 shares were traded throughout the day.

As a result, each month fell by 5 to 10 cents. The opening in the afternoon was flat.

<p>US Cotton Production Restriction Plan Revoked</p>
<p>The New York cotton market opened steadily, and prices were slightly higher, mainly due to purchases by spot dealers and foreign parties. Then, with the sharp drop in wheat and the emergence of bulls in Wall Street, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace claimed that the new Congress would find ways to repeal the old regulations restricting production, and the market price fell back. The main transaction throughout the day was to transfer the December term chips to the farther months. Near the closing, spot dealers bought the near term, short sellers covered, and colleagues also took advantage of the low to absorb, and the market price stabilized. The yarn and cloth market was calm and firm. It is estimated that the spot price did not move, and the futures rose and fell by 1 to 3 British pound sounds. British cotton futures fell by one point. The Indian cotton market was sluggish and unremarkable. It is estimated that Ping Guo Er rose by 7 and a half jiao, Ao Mu La rose by 1.5 Robi, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 5 jiao.

<h3 id="e39">On Biting Words and Chewing Phrases <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Lin</p>
<p>Writers, to vividly present their creations before the readers and capture their hearts, must first consider "What is the content?" Secondly, "How to express the content?" Here, we are saying that form is derived from content, and form is guided by content. At the same time, the quality of the form can also affect the content, which is a dialectical relationship. Therefore, writers need to skillfully and accurately describe their content, which is reality. Thus, the various problems in form cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Since the problems in form cannot be ignored (and should be paid attention to), then we can establish a topic about biting words and chewing phrases within the problems of form. Of course, we are not saying to use a flowery and elaborate style, focusing solely on words, using colorful and ornate language to dazzle the readers' eyes. Without content, no matter how elaborate the form, it is difficult to gain value. There is a reason why the four-six parallel prose style has been relegated to the museum of antiquities. We always take realistic subject matter as the center of our content. Writers, to describe vividly and write realistically, needless to say, need to spend some effort to consider and study the use of language and words. The following will explain this in several points.</p>
<p>(1) In a work, the cleverness or clumsiness of a sentence or a word often affects the overall excellence of the work. There are many examples of this. For example, Song Qi wrote the line "A red apricot blooms, stirring up spring's delight," and because of the use of the word "stirring up," the entire scene is vividly presented before the reader's eyes. Being called the "Red Apricot" vice minister was not accidental.</p>
<p>(2) We do not approve of the kind of deliberation that Jia Dao engaged in, perhaps over the issue of elegance versus vulgarity. He hesitated between "a monk pushes the moonlit gate" and "a monk knocks on the moonlit gate." In our view—according to the principles of realistic methods—if the monk is pushing the gate, we use the word "push"; if he is knocking on the gate, we use the word "knock," describing the reality as it is, without any embellishment. However, if the monk is both pushing and knocking on the gate, it is no wonder that he spends so much effort on "pushing and knocking."</p>
<p>(3) The placement or inversion of words and phrases is also very important, often giving the reader very different or even opposite concepts. It is remembered that Zeng Guofan, in a certain period of resistance against the requested "Long Hair Bandits," once reported the war situation to the Qing Dynasty, and in his memorial, there was the sentence "repeated defeats after repeated battles." A staff member changed it to "repeated battles after repeated defeats," which turned the "incompetence" into "a spirit of struggling hard and having remaining courage to encourage." This kind of distortion of facts by biting words and chewing phrases is very harmful. Readers must compare it with the facts to see it.</p>
<p>(4) It is not advisable to dilute the original quality with too much water, like a drop of semen diluted in a lot of water. We should use the most economical and concise words and phrases to express the most complete and perfect concepts. For example, Lin Hejing's poem about a small plum tree in a mountain garden:</p>
<p>Sparse shadows slant across the clear, shallow water,</p>
<p>A faint fragrance drifts in the moonlit dusk.</p>
<p>He used only a few strokes, a light touch, but gave the reader a true and beautiful impression. It can be said that the author grasped the essence of reality and was able to visualize it with skillful techniques. These mere fourteen characters are better than a lengthy essay. Although the styles are different, the theory is entirely consistent. Here, we want to raise two more points: first, authors need to bite words and chew phrases in their expression; readers, when reading a work, also need to bite words and chew phrases, even putting themselves in the place of the author of the work, seeking what is expressed skillfully and what is presented well, so as to understand the truthfulness of the work's content. Second, we are not saying that authors should first master the skill of biting words and chewing phrases before writing. On the contrary, writing is needed to develop and refine the author's skill of biting words and chewing phrases, as well as other important techniques.</p>
<p>However, according to the above description, since biting words and chewing phrases has such important significance, how should writers use words and sentences to accurately grasp the concept of the content or vividly present the concept of the content? This question is difficult to answer, right? However, we can offer a few opinions. First, just as writers need to extract the main typical characters from all kinds of social groups, writers need to select typical words and sentences from all the words and sentences. Moreover, the more words and sentences the writer possesses, the more freedom of choice they have, and the more completely they can express themselves. Secondly, objective reality is evolving and becoming more complex day by day, and the tools for expressing this reality must also evolve and become more complex. Therefore, we not only cannot cling to old words and phrases that are easy to read and pleasing to the eye, but also should create some new words and phrases as much as possible, whether by accepting foreign words or adopting local dialects. In this way, not only can the tools themselves develop, but the expression of the content will also be more complete and satisfying. We cannot hesitate to try because of the "biting words and chewing phrases" and "nitpicking" of some nativists. We must know that if we do not start now, there will never be a day when it sounds smooth and looks pleasing to the eye. Most importantly, third: the theory of creation should use realistic methods, and we should use realistic methods in our use of words and sentences as well. Gorky said in his essay on creative technique: "A literary work, to be worthy of the name of art—must give the work a perfect verbal form. What gives this form to a story or novel is simple, correct, clear, and concise language."</p>
<p>Finally, what should be paid more attention to is: the importance of the issue is not in the biting words and chewing phrases in form—the deliberation of using words and sentences, which is just a small topic. The most important thing is that the writer must correctly understand objective reality, so that the creative life experience has richness, diversity, and truthfulness. Within this scope, our biting words and chewing phrases have meaning, and can give the subject matter a perfect artistic form.</p>

<h3 id="e40">College Students and Dancing <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Shichang</p>
<p>If the newspapers hadn't published the news banning students from dancing, I really wouldn't have imagined that college students are actually the main patrons of dance halls. After this incident occurred, it attracted a lot of "public opinion." Recently, a gentleman analyzed the reasons why college students dance: (1) College students have money at home, (2) The social environment makes people feel bored, (3) Education is not done well, (4) Shanghai is too bad a place.</p>
<p>So the conclusion is that the current "dance ban policy" of various universities is a stopgap measure and will be difficult to achieve results: the fundamental solution lies in (1) Enriching the content of schools, (2) Finding ways to clarify social order to reduce people's boredom, (3) Giving less money to college students, (4) Promoting proper entertainment and games, (5) University professors leading by example, (6) Sanctions of public opinion; (7) Ballroom dancing can be encouraged, other dance forms should be despised.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, what is the current "dance ban policy" of various universities like? It is said that roll call is taken every night, and people are sent to the dance halls to investigate.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the dance ban policies of various universities will probably not have satisfactory results; however, the fundamental solutions involve such a large social environment that they may not be implemented immediately. For example, the last three reasons for the dancing craze cannot be solved piecemeal. For example, the fourth item, "Shanghai is too bad a place," is because Shanghai is an international city, and "international contradictions are all manifested here"; however, it is not known when Shanghai will be able to become a non-international Chinese city.</p>
<p>Even if Shanghai becomes a Chinese city, "contradictory phenomena"! Whether international or domestic, how can they not "be manifested here"?</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai did not lack improper entertainment, there were plenty of brothels; in the past, there were also many children of wealthy people among Shanghai's college students; however, in the past, we didn't often hear about college students frequenting brothels, but now the dancing craze has become a problem. There is probably another reason in between. If you ask someone who often goes to dance halls, he will definitely blurt out the answer: because dancing is cheap and the procedures are simple, you can go in and dance a few times with a few dollars in your pocket.</p>
<p>This kind of cheap and simple improper "entertainment" can be said to be a kind of "modernization." And the creation of this "modernization" also has internal reasons in this country, that is, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and too many women coming to the city to find work, the city cannot absorb them, and as a result, they have no choice but to sell their bodies.</p>
<p>Therefore, a small problem of college students dancing, if you get to the bottom of it, it will be terrible: college students dancing should be prohibited, but to deduce how to stop it without banning it, how to make those who want to dance have nowhere to dance, this is a very troublesome problem.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Innocent Child <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Li Chengxing</p>
<p>When the ××× Hospital telephoned my wife to inform her that the delivery was very safe, I felt very relaxed and happy. I immediately hired a rickshaw and went with Ah Bao: on the way, my thoughts were indeed not idle for half a moment. From today onwards, haven't I added another responsibility? If the infant had any knowledge, knowing that he would suffer extreme pain in this world in the future: that he would be subjected to all kinds of unreasonable ridicule by insidious people: also, that the whole world would only allow you to see the dark side, then, wouldn't the child curse me with a sharp voice? Ah, I am creating an innocent person to suffer in this world! I have committed a crime! "Parental love" is such a grand term, but who knows that the son's various pains are being given to him by his parents, these, the child has never known!</p>
<p>"Ah Bao, you have another younger brother!" I said, touching Ah Bao's head.</p>
<p>"It's fun to play with my younger brother, Dad, can you buy another foreign dog?" Ah Bao asked me, with an air as if his younger brother needed to play as soon as he was born.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the hospital, led by the nurse, I had already entered my wife's room. My wife was anxiously waiting for me on the bed, looking very tired, and it seemed to take all her strength to say a word.</p>
<p>"Don't you feel sad?" I asked about my wife's delivery.</p>
<p>"Where, it hurts a lot! Why didn't you come earlier."</p>
<p>"I didn't expect it to be so fast."</p>
<p>The baby's crying suddenly interrupted my conversation with my wife, and I immediately took him from the nurse's hand. The small life heavily pressed on my soul, because being a father is not just empty talk! The child's life, education, isn't it all handled by me alone?</p>
<p>"Let me see." My wife reached out her hand from the bed to take the child.</p>
<p>I immediately handed it over.</p>
<p>"Ah, ah." My wife touched the child's yellow and tender hair with satisfaction. At the same time, a loving gaze fell on the child.</p>
<p>In fact, my wife often said, "It's not good to have too many children. You have to teach them, you have to worry about them, and sometimes they are naughty, and you have to worry about their colds and fevers. Being a parent is like being half a horse!" But why is she so affectionate today? I was really a bit surprised. This must be the shining of a mother's love, right? This great maternal love must be surging in my wife's heart at this moment!</p>
<p>One evening after the birth, my wife and I joked.</p>
<p>"Fang, I've troubled you, don't ever again...!"</p>
<p>My wife folded her lips and finally laughed with a 'hee' sound.</p>
<p>At this time, the child's crying pierced into my heart again. So I thought again of the innocent child being pierced in his heart by a poisonous arrow again.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Death <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Death is a very simple matter; when one can't catch one's breath, one dies.</p>
<p>There isn't a single creature in the world that doesn't die, so before the "elixir of immortality" is invented, all humans have no hope of living forever. The leaflets and policies of "wild ginseng" and "life insurance companies" do not state how long the life of the customer should be extended. Since death is inevitable for humans and cannot be avoided by anyone, it is not surprising that it is not feared by people.</p>
<p>However, the above refers to those who "die peacefully in their sleep." In today's world, in addition to dying peacefully in one's sleep, the number of people who die unnatural deaths is countless. Moreover, it is not uncommon for people to die unnatural deaths without knowing why. What does this so-called life security mean? I dare not say.</p>
<p>"If the King of Hell decrees death at the third watch, he will not let one live until the fifth watch." Assuming there really is a King of Hell, then the King of Hell should personally send a ghost to fetch one, so that one can "die with a clear conscience." However, some people are suddenly shot dead on the main road in broad daylight. The murderer is neither the King of Hell nor a ghost, but a living man. He can swagger in and swagger out, and he can calmly kill several people like killing chickens. The murdered people had no enemies or rivals in their lives, so does that mean that what controls human life is not in the "underworld" but in the "mortal world?"</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one dies at the hands of a ghost or at the hands of a fellow human being, things must be clear. The dead are gone, but the living deserve an explanation. "Come clean, go clear." Death is only a matter of time. Those who cause death today may have their lives taken by others in the future. The theory of karma, that "good is rewarded with good, and evil is rewarded with evil," has not been truly denied. It can be said that those who take other people's lives now may have their lives taken by others in the future. If people fight for life with life, the resulting loss will certainly belong to society.</p>
<p>In this way, death is indeed simple, but unnatural and inexplicable deaths are very complex.</p>
<p>Under today's circumstances, people do not hope for the invention of some "elixir of immortality," but are urgently seeking reliable "life security."</p>
<h3 id="e58">On Eradicating Corrupt Titles <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>Titles in our country have a realistic significance representing change, and from titles, one can discern class distinctions and the old or new mindset. For example, in the feudal era, there were "Xianggong," "Gongzi," "Shaoye," "Laoye," "Taitai," "Furen," "Xiaojie," "Nainai," and even "Yuanwai" and "Yuanjun." These not-so-familiar names can be found in old novels, like "slaves" and "inferior people." Students called their teachers "Fuzi" and referred to themselves as "Wansheng," sometimes adding "Daren." Here, one can fully see the differences in various classes and the strong feudal coloring. Now that it is the 20th century, with human enlightenment and material civilization, we have even been called "world people" (according to a certain book). Therefore, such corrupt titles are naturally not applicable. Moreover, according to the principle of human equality, there should not be any class distinctions in titles. However, in our country, the ancient and stubborn thinking has not been fundamentally eradicated to this day, so those outdated titles are still uttered in so-called aristocratic families or by those who protect the old ways. Of course, we cannot allow this remaining poison to exist. Although it does not cause much practical harm, it invisibly exposes the backwardness of the times and undermines the line of human equality, so it should be eliminated!</p>
<p>According to a Nanjing telegram in a certain newspaper on the 18th of this month: "The Ministry of the Interior has recently issued an order to all provinces to abolish corrupt titles such as 'Laoye,' 'Taitai,' 'Xiaojie,' 'Shaoye,' etc., to avoid being laughed at by foreign countries, and has ordered that in the future, everyone should be called 'Xiansheng,' 'Laoxiansheng,' or 'Xuesheng.'" Originally, the titles in our country were too complicated; just like dialects, not to mention the differences between provinces and regions, even within the same region, there are many similar but different titles, such as "Yeye," "Baba," "Die die," "Renxiong," "Laoxiong," "Laoge," etc.</p>
<p>Now that autocracy has been abolished, there is no possibility for class titles such as "Laoye," "Shaoye," "Taitai," "Xiaojie," etc. to exist. If we continue to use them, it is tantamount to admitting a restoration and returning to the era of feudal autocracy. We have the simple and reasonable "Xiansheng" available, why must we imitate feudal autocracy and pursue this kind of class-conscious title? I really don't understand. I think the most common and appropriate title is "Xiansheng," and for elders, it is acceptable to call them "Laoxiansheng." That kind of title is both equal and easy to say, regardless of class or status, from the Chairman of the National Government to laborers and servants, all can use it. Originally, titles are not the most important thing, but within a country, there should be uniformity.</p>
<p>From the abolition of corrupt titles, I also thought of writing letters: In ancient times, when writing letters in our country, people often used elaborate phrases and lengthy polite remarks, resulting in a long and tedious letter in which it was often difficult to find a few relevant and important words, and its emptiness and superficiality were self-evident. The person writing the letter had to be respectful and exhaust their brains, preparing to show off their talent to the other party, but the person reading the letter would get a headache and be confused. In the end, the important words would be weakened, and even things would be delayed. I think this kind of spirit that is useless to others and harmful to oneself is unnecessary: it is better to directly state the facts straightforwardly, make sure every word is meaningful, speak clearly, write clearly, be popular, be fluent, and don't forget to be concise. A few words are fine, and we don't object to either classical or vernacular Chinese.</p>
<p>We also have to find ways to correct these rigid and corrupt attitudes, just like abolishing corrupt titles.</p>

<p>— Chi Yodai</p>
<p>It seems that my long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, being able to rent a small hut near the park. Naturally, it was a coincidence. A friend told me that there was such a hut suitable for me here, and the rent was unexpectedly cheap, which was the biggest issue. I had sacrificed a lot of time searching in this area like a hunting dog before, but all my efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>My luggage is so simple that I can set off two hours after deciding to move from this pier to that pier. Therefore, after crossing a few roads controlled by traffic lights, the landlord was surprised at how quickly I moved.</p>
<p>In a new environment, it seems that everything makes people excited. In fact, the reason is not that simple because I have realized my dream of several years. This can be illustrated by an example: regardless of the size of the matter, if you happen to buy a defective book at an old bookstore, and this defective book is exactly what you have not been able to find despite paying a high price, I know that you will be excited and satisfied all day, or even for a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Therefore, contrary to my previous habit of sleeping in, I am already looking out the window when the first sound in Shanghai rings out. Although it was late autumn when I moved, and now it is early winter, the morning wind seems to have a different kind of freshness, unlike the spring wind that is lazy, and unlike the summer wind that is cool. Every day, I experience the new feeling of this winter morning wind blowing on my body, but there are no fixed words to compare it to, and it has become a situation of both surprise and love.</p>
<p>The sky is just beginning to lighten, and the treetops in the park opposite are like a touch of Mi-style landscape painting, vaguely swaying in the wind. Occasionally, a few unknown sparrows chirp and sing. You must straighten your chest and take a deep, long breath. If you close your eyelids and meditate for a while, your body will feel somewhat ethereal.</p>
<p>However, this precious miracle is only a fleeting moment. When the landlord's servant pushes the door open and comes in, the world in front of you has changed.</p>
<p>This world: has ever-changing white clouds, has the rising sun with golden rays, has the sound of distant steam whistles... This world is moving.</p>
<p>Naturally, human life is moving. If you are forever immersed in a quiet world, you will become a cursing attitude to hate that fleeting precious miracle. But I didn't say not to want a moving world, I said the moving world is not as good as the quiet world. However, the number of people in the 3 million population who can watch this moving world transform into a disturbing world is unknown.</p>
<p>At this time, I wash my face and brush my teeth, and take a book to the park. Many times, I meet the little girl who delivers the newspaper at the door. In fact, taking books and newspapers to the park is not necessarily about choosing a place specifically to read seriously as if you were in a library. However, you whistle and stroll to the pond, and a vacant iron chair is waiting for you. Then sit down and spread the newspaper on the colored cover, casually turning to a page. You can look around as much as you like. A new clump of flowers has opened over there, a few small fish jump out of the water leisurely, or a familiar fellow nods to you with a smile. When your eyelids feel tired, then bring your gaze back to the newspaper to rest for a while. There may be a novel news item that makes you smile. Even flipping through a few illustrations or advertisements is quite meaningful. It is said that women are crutches, and newspapers may be able to serve this purpose for lonely people. What do you think?</p>
<p>When I go back, I exchange a bunch of flowers from an old flower seller. I know that putting them in my vase is cruel, but I have not used them as gifts to do something even more cruel, so I never feel guilty about it.</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Sound of Trains Haunts My Dreams Every Night <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>A cream-colored building stands isolated near the Beijing-Shanghai railway line. Its situation is lonely. Although there are flower-growing families nearby, the fields are full of purple, orange-yellow, scarlet, bright red, and unnamed flowers. These flowers will be transported to the wealthy families in the city as pure offerings on the table.</p>
<p>It must be a chance encounter! I lived in that cream-colored building as if in a dream. Every day, when I get up in the morning, a white-clothed waiter brings cheese cakes and a cup of oriental-flavored tea, carefully placing them on my dining table. When I return to the lounge, the empty shells of the Chesterfield cigarettes that I finished smoking last night are gone, and a newly opened can of Three Cannon Towers is placed there instead. Therefore, I sit quietly on the velvet sofa and smoke.</p>
<p>Life is leisurely and wealthy. Naturally, the person who persuaded me to come to this cream-colored building has great expectations, because I am a young man, and young people love strength, love heat, and also love light. Therefore, my previous life was hot and prickly. However, when that kind of hot and prickly life could no longer continue, my lifestyle changed and became gray, decadent, and wandering. Because of this, I was forced into this cream-colored building. Their intention is to hope that I can rest quietly for a year and, through quiet self-reflection, put my life back on track.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Perhaps their self-righteous plan will be fruitless, because in my heart, there is a southern swallow that flies in and out, but never wants to stay for a moment. Therefore, my heart is afraid of being disheartened. In that case, making life a little more regular is not an easy thing.</p>
<p>Every moment, I sit quietly in this cream-colored building, listening to the trains coming from Nanjing and going to Shanghai, sounding with deafening noise, getting closer to my ears, and then farther away!</p>
<p>However, at night, even a strand of white hair falling on a red leather book can be heard with a loud sound, and every sound, every time, stirs my heartstrings, reminding me of the dream-like days of the past, the dream-like, colorful deeds in the dream-like days.</p>
<p>However, when I fall into a peaceful sleep, I am awakened by the shrill sound of train whistles, and the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy flavors in my dream fade away in my weak memory! No matter how hard I try to repeat and patch them together for a long night, they are still incomplete, aren't they? However, every night, I am dreaming a string of incomplete dreams!</p>
<h3 id="e62">East, West, South, North <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>Lu Wenqing, a young man from Henan, turned to a life of depravity and theft due to the pain of unemployment after graduating from university. He was sentenced to four months in prison as a warning after the matter was discovered.</p>
<p>Not my friend Hu Shi's conversation with a reporter from the Beijing Daily News. I, who am teaching at Peking University, have seen many university graduates. Except for a very small number of special cases, most of them can find considerable jobs after graduation... Therefore, if you want to work happily and have no worries about unemployment, the first thing you must have is the ability and knowledge to do the job... Those who cannot find employment should seek the reasons why they cannot find employment, and do not need to complain about the world and blame others, but only blame themselves. If you have the ability, why worry about not having food to eat...</p>
<p>This is the doctor's opinion. Naturally, it is very measured. A university student like Lu Wenqing is probably something that the doctor, while eating fancy food and smoking cigars, would never dream of. "You reap what you sow!" Does the doctor think so?</p>
<p>However, it is indeed a fact. The editor of the newspaper does not necessarily deliberately create rumors. Then, borrowing the doctor's conclusion, "As for the relief of unemployment, it is another kind of social problem. It is also the responsibility of society to provide jobs for the unemployed."</p>
<h3 id="e63">Sketches of Dance Hall Figures <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>Many women who drifted away from their men's teams revealed their vulgar faces that were usually decorated. Seeing a female companion sitting on the other side, they ran over and danced lightly with the companion's man's arm around their waist under the dark green light. It was as if it wouldn't hurt their own men at all. Without any reservations. If men did the same: eagerly going to the table of someone else's female companion who has a man, the reaction would be different. Even if they didn't say any dissatisfied words, there was no need to convey the meaning with sound. The sudden change of face was a clear indication of extreme dissatisfaction. It goes without saying that there was even more discord in their hearts.</p>
<p>The selfish thoughts peculiar to women are easily expressed unconsciously at certain times. They may have a temporary hugging relationship with other men, but they do not allow men to have contact with other women. Approximately every woman is inevitable of this unconscious thought. They worry that the temporary hugging relationship will develop into entanglements that go beyond temporality. If that becomes a fact, it is equivalent to a robbery of their own love, so they have this preventive behavior to prevent accidents. However, if a man's feelings may overflow beyond ordinary social interactions, then a woman's feelings may naturally also have the same overflowing effect. Because the emotional intrusion between people is of the same form. But few men have measured up to this. Letting their women dance with friends is a very ordinary occasion. But they don't trust others so much that they even obstruct the woman's freedom of action, which is a social courtesy. The inferiority of women to men can be seen from these places. Due to a certain terrible illusion created by the heart, their spirits are constantly troubled by this illusion. And especially when mixed in a dance hall with more men, that illusion will become increasingly thick. Before a glimpse, their mood was still full of joy and delight. Perhaps after a moment, their mood will change greatly. Joy and delight quickly sink. And the whole thing is shrouded in unwarranted worries. If a man accidentally opens his mouth a few more times or shows a little more smile while dancing with another woman, the feeling given to the woman will be even more painful, unbearable, and even lead to the sadness of seeming to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Women have a narrow heart that men do not have. Therefore, the troubles they attract are indeed more numerous and more harmful than those of men. Some things do not need to be taken so seriously, and do not need to be thought about so much. However, women always like to not take things so seriously, and not think so much. They worry about things that don't need to be worried about. Then all kinds of meaningless torments are self-inflicted. However, if men see through this state of mind of women and don't want to call women to be entangled in the net of suffering created by themselves. It is better to do less of those actions that can be reduced, and only dance with their own women, and not dance with any other women, which is a loss for women to suffer for no reason. Therefore, single men are more lonely guarding the table than single women are. Women's emotions are truly incredible, just like silkworms binding themselves. They spit out silk, form cocoons, and then put themselves in the cocoons. They originally went to a place with a full sense of enthusiasm. When they get to the place, they don't know why they disappear, and they feel disappointed, annoyed, and even regret coming out. Especially in the dance hall, women cannot completely hide this expression of joys and sorrows, which is displayed in front of men.</p>
<p>Women's hearts are fragile and small after all.</p>

<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Cruel people, why do you use such terrible means to deal with us? You curse us, hate us, and spare no effort to use your brains to manufacture all kinds of machines to capture us every day, as if you won't give up until the mice are extinct. Why is it like this? We are the same animals, with the same blood and flesh!</p>
<p>You often scold us for being bastards, saying that we shouldn't bite the objects in the house or steal the food you store. This seems to be the crime for which we are to be sentenced to death! But we also have unavoidable difficulties. Why not give us some time to defend ourselves before imposing cruel punishments?</p>
<p>You should believe that a person who can maintain their own life is never willing to be a thief. At the same time, solving the problem of livelihood is an instinct that all living things have. We are also one of the living things! We know hunger, and we know how to find food to relieve our hunger. This is nature, and nature cannot be changed by human power. People can find something to eat when they are hungry, so why can't we? Why do we have to be sentenced to death for finding food?</p>
<p>Let's talk about biting things. We are also forced to do this. Our teeth grow very quickly. If we don't bite things, our teeth can drill out of our lips in a few days. In order to prevent this unfortunate event, we certainly have to bite things to wear down their growth. This is the same as people using their brains. If you don't use your brains, your brains will degenerate. In order to make your brains develop, you have to use them. This is the truth of nature. Why can you apply the truth, but we are punished for the truth?</p>
<p>It's too unfair, really, too unfair! God created humans, and God created us. God did not specify that humans can arbitrarily slaughter us. We have the same freedom to exist. The Earth belongs to all living things. Who can say that the world is solely owned by humans?</p>

<p>Opening: "Reed Forest"</p>
<p>Deep in the reed forest, birds startle and fly. The mist is thin and the smoke is light, obscuring the view. Five carts of books are enough for three winters. Jiang Xiuru strolls idly with nothing to do. In the reeds, he hears cries. It is the wife of Pang, the Third Daughter. Third Daughter appears. She stops crying. She calls out to Jiang Lang, "Please wait!" She says, "I am not virtuous, I have violated the way of a wife." She also says, "I don't understand and have deceived you with hidden intentions." Today, it must be clear whether it is right or wrong. "Oh, I have befriended neighbors as relatives, kept track of how many families had how many items of clothing, cursed my mother-in-law who passed away early. How can I excuse these three unfilial offenses? " Jiang Lang, I read the "Instructions for Women" in my youth. I know a thing or two about the great rituals and constant virtues. Serving my mother-in-law is my duty. Even if people don't know, Heaven knows. I hope Jiang Lang will take me home. Remember when we were a married couple? An'an is young. Don't deceive me, but don't deceive our child." Jiang immediately felt a sense of misery upon hearing this. But how could he dare defy his mother's orders? "Let me first go back and report in detail. If mother agrees, I will take in An'an and then fetch you, my wife."</p>

<p>Ms. Wang Bingmei's Tang Poetry</p>
<p>Hua Xing (1260) 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Sent to Han, Advisor to the Emperor</p>
<p>I am not happy now, I think of Yueyang.</p>
<p>My body wants to fly, but I am sick in bed.</p>
<p>Beautiful women are separated by the autumn water.</p>
<p>Washing their feet in Dongting, gazing at the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>Wild geese fly in the dark, the sun and moon are white.</p>
<p>Red maple leaves, the sky rains frost.</p>
<p>The Jade Capital, a group of emperors gather at the Big Dipper.</p>
<p>Some ride unicorns, shaded by phoenixes.</p>
<p>Lotus banners, smoke and mist fall.</p>
<p>Shadows move, reflecting the upside-down scenery of Xiao and Xiang.</p>
<p>The star palace lords are drunk on fine wine.</p>
<p>Feathered men are few and not by their side.</p>
<p>It seems I heard that yesterday, Red Pine Master</p>
<p>Is probably Han Zhangzi of the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>In the past, he followed the Liu clan to secure Chang'an.</p>
<p>The tent has not changed, but his spirit is sadly wounded.</p>
<p>How dare I discuss the success or failure of the nation?</p>
<p>Although my color is tainted and decaying, I eat maple fragrance.</p>
<p>Staying in Zhou Nan is a pity of ancient times.</p>
<p>Old Xin in the South Pole should be long-lived and prosperous.</p>
<p>Beautiful women, why are you separated by the autumn water?</p>
<p>How can you be placed in the jade hall of tribute?</p>
<p>Old Cypress Tree - Du Fu</p>
<p>In front of Zhuge Liang's temple, there is an old cypress tree.</p>
<p>Its branches are like bronze, and its roots are like stone.</p>
<p>Its bark is slippery with rain, forty spans around.</p>
<p>Its dark green color reaches the sky, two thousand feet tall.</p>
<p>Clouds come and its breath connects with the Wuxia Gorge.</p>
<p>The moon rises and its coldness connects with the white snow mountain.</p>
<p>The ruler and his minister have already met with the times.</p>
<p>The trees are still cherished by people.</p>
<p>I remember yesterday, winding around the east of Jinting Pavilion.</p>
<p>The First Ruler and Martial Marquis were buried in the same palace.</p>
<p>The towering branches and trunks are ancient in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The secluded and graceful painted doors and windows are empty.</p>
<p>Although it is situated well, it is isolated.</p>
<p>Lonely and high in the dark, it often faces strong winds.</p>
<p>It is supported by the power of the gods.</p>
<p>Its uprightness is originally due to the work of creation.</p>
<p>If the great building is about to collapse, it needs beams and pillars.</p>
<p>The yellow ox turns its head and the hills are heavy.</p>
<p>It does not reveal its literary talent, yet the world is already amazed.</p>
<p>Who can send it away if it does not decline pruning?</p>
<p>How can a bitter heart avoid accommodating ants?</p>
<p>Fragrant leaves will eventually lightly house luan and phoenixes.</p>
<p>Do not complain, ambitious scholars and hermits,</p>
<p>Since ancient times, great talents have been difficult to use.</p>

<p>Recently, actor Liu Yawei, along with Jin Xi, Gu Chi, and others, have organized a "Modern Storytelling Radio Broadcasting Society," and have gathered colleagues from the film industry, Mr. Wei Heling and Ms. Liu Liying, to conduct experiments at a certain radio station soon. According to members of the society, the name "Modern Storytelling" was chosen instead of "Radio Drama" because drama is fundamentally unsuitable for radio broadcasting. However, with the name "Modern Storytelling," the content should exceed the achievements of existing radio drama broadcasts, and will soon provide a brand new appreciation in radio programs. The society's office is located at No. 25 Yonggui Lane, Edward Road. Mr. Gu Chi is the person in charge of the society. All matters of contact are welcome, and it's not just business talk.</p>
<p>From today, the Dunben Radio Station will add Yang Binkui and Yang Zhenxiong, father and son, as a double act from 4:15 PM to 5:00 PM. Please listen to the report for the name of the story. Also, in response to requests from listeners from all walks of life, from 11:00 AM, Chen Lianqing, Qi Lianfang, Yu Xiaoxia, Yu Xiaoyun, and Jiang Binchu will broadcast five acts of storytelling, "Jade Dragonfly Clouds."</p>
<p>The Children's Health Association organized by the China and West Radio Station will invite famous people from Shanghai, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, the Director of the Health Bureau, and Wang Yansong to broadcast lectures from 4:30 PM this afternoon.</p>
