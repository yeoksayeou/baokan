<p>米蘭意大利之接受修正後之東羅迦諾公約、略情已見日昨政府方面之佈告、今日意首相之機關意大利人民報復有更詳細之揭載、該報今日之論文稱、東羅迦諾公約之原有計劃、係根據於反德之目的、惟法外長巴爾都訪問倫敦之時、該約之原旨已有急劇之變動、故今日之新約文已成一種十成全新之文書、新約文中非但包括法國倘被德國襲擊時、蘇俄應與以担保及援助、及蘇俄被德國襲擊時、法國亦如之、並反而言之、德國受蘇俄或法國之襲擊時、法國及蘇俄亦與法國以同樣之担保及援助云、且新恊定復有一極重要之點、卽德國所長久要求之軍備平等權、今日亦得一事實上之承認、因此德國所以脫離國聯之理由、今日亦已破除矣該報末謂、「吾人之立塲正與英國相同、卽吾人在原有羅迦諧公約之外、並不更負何種份外之責任也（十四國民電）</p>

<h3>德國政變依然莫解之謎　希特勒殺一婦人猶不敢道及　國會宣言終未能祛除羣疑</h3>
<p>（倫敦）明星報發表社論、批評希特勒對德國衆議院發表之宣言、略謂希氏對於六月三十日之事變、旣未說明詳細經過、亦未能解釋必須如此行動之理由、其言曰、「希特勒殺人十五天以後、吾人猶莫明所以、而死事諸人之姓名、至今亦無人知之、所謂陰謀案、於希氏殺人之後、外間紛紛傳說、其内中情形、究竟若何、日久之後、當能逐漸暴露、但至今尙未提出陰謀之證據、說者謂其醞釀情形、極爲複雜、又謂當軍之中、加入恐怖主義份子、而未經宣誓者、恐其行爲不軌、故必劖除之、果使如此、則希特勒與其黨徒、何不早爲之所、而必待至不可救藥、始以屠戮解决之乎、因此吾人又欵死事諸人、所以不保首領者、或因其品行太壞所致、然此輩平日行爲污穢、世界之人孰不知之、希氏詎能因此而下毒手乎、希特勒宣言、謂渠之所爲自負責任、但有一事渠絶無一言道歉、卽前總理施萊轍夫人之被害是也、希氏向以勇敢自詡、今殺一婦人、而不敢道及、其爲勇敢、顧如是乎、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑞士京城此間出版之「本德報」、評論德總理希特勒昨日之宣言、略謂「六月三十日事變中被害人數、德國方面雖陸續宣布、然旣不詳盡、且多矛盾報界業已指出此點矣、希特勒昨認爲有補充說明之必要、故將死事人數重行宣布、第希特勒此次殺人、不經判决、而眞知重要内情者、多被劖除、以是希特勒雖有補充說明、然吾人仍以爲此中黑幕、猶未揭破也、其尤爲奇離莫解者、爲巴本之地位、巴氏對於此次之一、不能完全同意、然又求去而不能、其現在情形如何、殊命人難以促摸、巴塞爾日報謂「國社黨所抱之原則、卽六月卅日如不以毒辣手段出之則國社黨政權將從此掃地、希特勒與其國社主義、在内政上曾感受不少困難、但自昨日英國下議院、討論外交之後、國際時局、就德國以及就全歐洲言之、均已轉換、以後德國政府在外交上所將感到之困難、將較内政爲尤甚矣、」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本擴張海軍敬</h3>
<p>日本岡田新内閣之成立。就其一般性質而論。堪稱齋藤閣之延長。爲該國保持現狀之表現。就其内在性質而加以透視。則又知以海軍軍人領導政治。其對外使命端在於如何以海軍實力扼制太平。而操縱遠東局面。蓋日美外交漸趨僵化。在美國對於遠東。固不易求眞正和平之措置。其惟一有效方法。祇在英美之共同行動。以維持太平洋上之安全。然而英國之觀點不同。其意殆謂英日諒解實較英美之提携爲重。於是日本乃乘𨻶發揮其縱横外交之妙腕。先之以廣田赫爾之文書交換。繼之以四·一七之外部聲明。復派近衛文磨赴美。冀取得兩國之諒解。惟以日人之狡獪。寗不知太平洋國際關係之複雜。所謂外交手腕。不過在敷衍現局作一時之緩衝而已。設使英美果能一致行動。則在將來之海軍軍備縮小會議席上。日本必不免處於被動地位。如此則豈但制霸太平洋一事爲近於夢想。卽遠東均勢亦必至於重新新樹立也。</p>
<p>一九三六年轉瞬卽屆日本將謂退出國聯之預先通告發生效力。然隨之而起者。則有前德屬加洛林·馬里亞納·馬夏爾諸羣島之代管問題。各該羣島皆有關於日本之國防。該國海軍軍閥。必將竭力應付。可無疑義。此一事也。日人運用外交。離間英美。現已漸著成效。於是更進一步而圖（甲）推翻華盛頓倫敦兩次海軍會議所定之海軍比率主張英美日三國海軍絶對平等。（乙）表示日本之决心與努力。提出一九三五年至一九三六年度含有七億五千萬圓日金之海軍預算。（丙）以日本空軍遠遜他人爲藉口除在第二次海軍補充計劃中增加八隊航空機外。另行增加飛機隊數並將舊機一律更新。擴充續航能力至於一萬二千公里。此又一事也。</p>
<p>在今日之海軍强國中。英國以其殖民地遍世界。遇有任何事變。極難集中全艦隊勢力用以攻人。美國介乎兩大洋之間。現有兵力足以保守巴拿馬運河之門户。維繫對中南美洲之門羅主義而已欲越太平洋而保護菲利濱。使遠東航權不受日本之侵犯實非易易。惟日本壤地狹小沿涨各港灣莫不險峻天成。稍加設備。卽有金湯之固。是故在華盛頓會議時之日政府祇須美國承認不建設菲利濱及關島要塞。英國不增厚香港兵力。卽欣然同意於五五三之比率。此非日本故意示弱。實因明知菲利濱與香港之設防疏懈如不亟予充實。可以隨時隨地集中兵力。而加以襲擊。故不爲過甚也。曩昔日人之所懼者。惟英美之聯合封鎖。使彼局促於一隅之軍力無所施展其長今則情勢大變封鎖日本之舉。殆不可能。一則因日本之海岸線太長英美現有艦隊絶無此種能力。再則因日本海之交通萬難斷絶。日本以現有軍力。足以維持此類之航線也。日本退可以守。進可以戰。故敢有恃而無恐說者謂岡田新内閣</p>
<p>成立。海縮之前途。更形黯淡。豈無故哉。</p>

<p>（東京）廣田外相現經岡田首相之懇請、决計蹈襲前内閣在五相會議所决定之外交國防方針、以發揮其恊和外交之精神、其實施之外交政策、根本方針大致分述如左、</p>
<p>（一）日本念及東亞和平唯一之安定力、並</p>
<p>以國際關係當以和平爲主、而由外交手段以期貫澈日本之主張、（二）對於軍縮會議、務以公正態度處之、以努力貫澈主張、倘對方國出其不盡情理之行動時、卽斷然脫離亦在所不辭、（三）爲確立對蘇聯及對中國之善隣關係計、首應力圖解决懸案、（四）爲擁護海外商權計、須講求必要之措置、以便日本商品容易向外發展、（五）爲實施上項適宜措置計、須添設駐外公使或領事、並應配置商務官以便擴充、（六）力圖確立政治經濟及其他一切對滿政策、因此日本當傾其全力以謀日「滿」之共</p>

<h3>讀書問答　再談絶對眞理與相對眞理丨答林斐君丨</h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>讀了你們的「相對眞理和絶對眞理」，有點疑問，請求你們公開地解答。</p>
<p>第一，你們認爲絶對眞理是相對眞理的總和，我覺得有點不正確。絶對眞理是由相對眞理綜合地發展而成、决不是相對眞理的總和。二者·非單有量的差别，在質上也不是完全一樣的。你們說絶對眞理是多方面的，而相對眞理就是牠的一方面，這是對的；但相對眞理的一切方面的總和就等於絶對眞理嗎？不對。就拿瞎子摸象的例子來說吧。象的頭，鼻，牙齒，腿，軀體··都是象的一部份，牠們反映在瞎子腦子裏的槪念，就各自成爲一個關於象的相對眞理。但把這些部份堆在一起，就等於一隻活象嗎？不對！你們旣然知道一相對眞理有發展而爲絶對眞理的可能」，旣然知道「人類的認識是從相對眞理的過程中漸漸接近絶對眞理」，爲什麽又認爲絶對眞理是相對眞理的總和？</p>
<p>第二，欠癜一邊說絶對眞理是永久普遍的眞理，同時又指出「絶對眞理的本身也不是完全固定不動的···」，這其間的矛盾又怎樣解釋呢？我認爲所謂絶對眞理就是客觀現實的眞實的法則，牠是有絶對性，永久性的。人類認識的進步，尺能更加接近牠，甚至完全把握牠，但决不能影響牠的本身。「··我們所達到的絶對眞理與無限多樣的宇宙萬物比較起來，牠仍是相對的不完全的東西，牠只在我們實踐物一定的階級裏有絶對的完一的意義，實踐愈發展，則絶對眞理的内容也愈豐富，而其眞理的價値也愈增高。」我覺得這里你們所說的絶對眞理，其實却是相對眞理，否則絶對眞理和相對眞理的差别在那里？</p>
<p>一林斐來信丨</p>
<p>眞理的相對和絶對，在哲學上是一個繁難而又極重要的問題，林雯君對我們前次關於這問題的文章提出這兩點疑問，問得非常扼要，現在解答如下：</p>
<p>關於第一問，我們的意見和林雯君的意見並沒有兩樣，我們說相對眞理可以發展而爲絶對眞理，這在林君也不會否認。但林君所懷疑的是我們所用的「總和」二字。他以爲絶對眞理不只是相對眞理的總合，而應該是相對眞理「綜合地發展而成」的。這一點，我們要先指出，在前次的文字中，我們的結論是：「絶對眞理是相對眞理的總和，總計或歸結，」而不單單說「總和」，林雯把下面的「總計或歸結」二字忽略了，所以發生這誤解。我們並不曾把絶對眞理只看做相對眞理的機械的凑合，我們加上了「總計或歸結」，其意思就在指明我們所說的總和是發展的總和。並且嚴密地考察起來，一切事物的總和，對於那一切事物也不只是量的差别，一達到總和的階段時，質也自然會變化的。五雖然是二和三的總和，但五這數目的性質與二或三都有差異的。就以林君所舉的瞎子摸象的故事來說，摸着脚瞎子說象有點像柱子，摸着肚子的說像牆，摸着鼻子的說像蛇，·····各人有各人的相對而不完全的眞理，但如果每個人都能由一部分摸到其他部分，則每個人的知識就發展起來，最後人人都同意象這東西，是由各部分構成的，其中有一部分像柱子，一部分像牆，一部分像蛇··這樣，每個人對於象所得到的整個的印象（絶對眞理），仍不外是各人的相對眞理之總和。同時這總和起來的印象，與以前各人個别的印象也不只是量的不同，而是質的差異，因整個的印象與柱子的印象或牆的印象是决不相同的。總之，宇宙間無論任何事物，它的量如果增加到一定的程度時，必然的會引起質的變化，决不會有戰是量增加的而無質的變化的東西。林君以爲「總和」二字中只包含着量變的異味而後有質變的意味，這是他對於（總和）的含義還沒有深刻的思考得到罷？自然，林君所說的「综合地發展而成」一語，是很對的，但我們說絶對眞理是相對眞理之總合，也沒有不妥，因爲我們下面又加上「總計或歸結」一語，表明這總和是發展的總合，表明那不是機械的凑合。</p>
<p>關於第二個問題，我們認爲絶對眞理内部也含有相對性，所以絶對眞理可以因人類認識的無限的進步而不斷地提高。旣在是絶對眞理，當然有永久性和普遍性，但永久性和普遍性與「凝固不變」是不同的。絶對眞理的永久性和普遍性决不能妨碍它的發展。舉例來說：牛頓的萬有引力定律，應用在宇宙中是永久而普遍的眞理，愛因斯坦的相對論出現以後，牛頓的定律便受了一番改革，但並不因此能根本推翻牛頓定律，牛頓的定律在相對論出現之後仍一樣地有絶對的價値，不過對於這定律的說明方法却更加完滿，使這定律的内容更加豐富。又如物理學上的量子論之出現，使人覺得牛頓的引力只能適用於大宇宙中，而不能嚴密地適用於電子的微小世界裏，或大宇宙裏牛頓定律是必然法則，而在電子世界裏它只是蓋然法則，即只有一定程度的凖確性而非嚴密的凖確性。但雖然是蓋然法則，牛頓的法則之能普遍適用仍沒有根本推翻。</p>
<p>由以上的例子，我們可以知道絶對眞理中也含有相對性。相對眞理和絶對眞理决不能看做兩種互相隔離得水泄不通的東西，相對眞理能發展而爲絶對眞理，所以它内部有絶對眞理的萌芽，絶對眞理是由相對眞理總合而成，所以它自身不會是一定圓滿，而仍有無限發展的可能性。正如林君所說，「絶對眞理是客觀現實的法則，」眞理達到絶對的階設，已抓着了事物的一個大原則，所以就有了永久普遍性。但同時也只是達到了原則的地步，並不能因此拒絶了那内容的充實和提高。</p>
<p>我們的答覆如此，讀者是否還有懷疑，請盡量地提出來！</p>

<h3>網球新術（六）</h3>
<p>Ｊ·ＰＡＲＭＬＹ　ＰＡＲＥＴ原著</p>
<p>錢一勤洪均合譯</p>
<p>丨版權所有不准轉載丨</p>
<p>網球名手誠然有在未拍擊的時候、目光不專注於球的、不過他們因此在比賽時失敗者、是數見不鮮、並且名手的特殊的習慣、决不是初學者所應當學的、他們實在經過很長時期的衷訓練、技術已臻上乘、所以就能够做到、初學者或未經久練的球員、是絶對不應當倣傚的、</p>
<p>在球拍還沒有和球相遇的時候、目光能够離球的人、必須對於拍對於拍擊動作要有充份的訓練、並且還要有長久的經騐、能够估定來球的角度、反躍和飛程、他能預料到在一定的時間以内、來球在空中必是懸在幾英寸以内的地方、</p>
<p>他們目光離球的原因、完全是因爲要向對方瞄凖、所以讓球懸在空中幾英寸以内的時候、將目光移向着瞄凖的地方去、普通的球員看着球、或者可以拍到他所要拍的幾尺以内的地方、但是一個球員的技術進步、到能先瞄凖地方、然後將球擊到他所要擊的幾寸以内的地方、那麽較弱的對手、是沒有不失敗的、</p>
<p>球向面前來的時候、務必要向旁邊讓開、不可迫促地去迎擊、若是球直向着面前來、就要順着此次係採用正手或反手拍擊法、將足部移向左邊或右邊、讓球向旁邊飛去、即使有時足部要向前後移動時、也不可讓身軀和球的飛程成直綫、初學者每喜正面迎擊、那是最不得當的擊法、</p>
<p>當凖備着地位去拍擊的時候、就絶對地要讓球的飛程向左邊或向右邊去、雙足和球的飛程須成平行綫、就是要從旁邊拍球、使手臂和球拍有充份的餘地、可以儘量地擺動、所以在拍擊時、總要讓球飛向一旁、然後側轉身軀去應付、</p>
<p>讓開地方、使球向旁邊飛去、然後側轉身軀、順勢向前一伏、藉着順勢力、使球拍有一種極自由且極有力的擺動、這才是穏妥的擊法、若是迎着來球、身軀不向旁邊讓開、那就太逼近了球、身軀不得不　後仰、拍球的手也受到絶大的拘束、所以有一位曾奪錦標的名家常說、他偶爾失誤的原因、是因爲逼球大近、</p>
<p>更有許多球藝較精的人、在正當拍擊的時候、足部不踏在固定的地位、但是趕上去拍擊、此種方法、因爲藉着身軀的動量、拍擊時、全身的體重、就自動的順着勢傳到球拍上、因而增加不少的力量、這當然是一種很大的益處、但是這種半奔跑勢的迎擊方式、非要有豐富經騐的人、不能够做到的、此時球正向前急飛、還要移動身軀、和移動球拍去應付、那就對於應有的速力和應站的地位、實難算定、</p>
<p>奔跑迎擊守在難免犯逼球太近的弊病、太近球拍就受拘束、若是太遠、又有達不到的危險、所以無論如何、初學者在可能範圍以内、當拍擊時、足部總要踏在固定的地位、此種容易失誤而極難有效的奔跑迎擊式、暫爲祗得認是望塵莫及、</p>
<p>雙足和球的飛程成平行綫、當然在正手拍擊時、左足移向前、在反手拍擊時、右足移向前、此種方式、擊球的手臂就極自由、可以儘量地向前掃去、</p>
<p>掃擊的動作、球員站立的地位、完全像打「哥而夫」球一樣、打「哥而夫」的球員、將雙足向着球分開而立、使球在雙足中間相等距離的前方、或偏近左足、或偏近右足、然後將球掃擊出去、掃擊網球時也是一樣、擊時的地位偏左右偏右、就看來球的形勢再定、在要藉着順勢力造成遠飛球的時候、掃擊來球的地位要略向前、至於從低處截球或從高處砍球的時候、掃擊來球的地位、就略向後、或者是略爲在靠近左足的地位、</p>
<p>然而掃擊時最好的地位、還是來球在雙足中間相等距離的前方、至於對付不同的拍擊法、雙足應站立不同的地位、後章將詳細討論、但是雙足掃擊時當站立的地位、是向左右平均立着、總要</p>
<p>認爲最好的規律、</p>
<p>若是預先己確切地料定了球的距離和反躍的高度、於是立足的部位、務要使球恰巧躍起在褲帶鈕扣的正前面、如此可以使手臂向後的擺動有餘地、同時向前的順勢力、也不致减少、</p>
<p>總之、目不離球、在凖備迎擊時雙足趕快地站在塲面上應處的地位、來球飛近時、身軀要讓在一旁、使有充份的拍擊餘地、足跟不着地、膝部微灣、上身全部也要略向前蹲、迎擊來球時、雙足要立在和球的飛程成平行綫的地位、使來球恰巧躍起在身軀中部的前方對面、並且身體和球之間、還要有相當的距離、使拍擊時、身軀能够向前伏、藉着順勢和體重去增加拍擊的力量、</p>
<p>以上的規律、初學者、必要都已恪守、然後才可以實行擊球、</p>

<h3>儲蓄銀行法之我見</h3>
<p>— 謝菊曾</p>
<p>最近立法院通過之傠蓄銀行法，業於七月四日由國府命令公布。本法對於保障存户，扶植農村，獎勵傠蓄，誠可謂面面顧到，良工心苦，彌堪欽佩。顧間有數點，似不無研討餘地，試申述之：</p>
<p>一、界說之研究歷次儲蓄銀行法草案，對於儲蓄銀行之定義，均採列舉主義，誠嫌累墜，且仍不免掛漏，故最後改採槪括主義；本法第一條開宗明義即載「凡以複利方法收受零星存欵者，爲儲蓄銀行。」惟此所謂「零星存欵」之定義何？似猶有待於解釋。若謂不滿十元之數爲零星，則書局商店儘有吸收百元五百元之整數存欵，今後殆可不受本法之拘束。若以一元至數十元以至百十元奇零之數爲一零星，則普通銀行錢莊憑摺收付之活期存欵，均將移置於本法監督之下。至於複利云云，普通存欵，殆無一而非複利計算；錢莊之往來存欵，</p>
<p>且均每月複利一次，是一複利方法」與「零星存欵」等字標，初不足象徵儲蓄存欵。而本法一經下如是之界說，在一方面旣無以取締普通商店之濫營儲蓄業務，在另一方面則法意影響所及；將使全國普通銀行錢莊，有舉步荆棘之感，當非制定本法之初意也。</p>
<p>大抵眞正之儲蓄存欵，以屬於個人居多；次之則爲公益團體，或合作社。至於商家欵項進出，除以前領用支票之存户，間有屬於小商家外，極少有與儲蓄銀行發生關係者。今後本法旣不許活期存欵使用支票，則商家與儲蓄銀行，更形疏遠。竊以爲若於施行法中明白規定，凡以複利方法收受個人公益團體或全作社之剩餘資金爲存欵者，爲儲蓄銀行。一則其界說</p>
<p>，似比較稍爲確切耳。</p>
<p>二、活期存欵限額問題本法第五條規定活期存欵各户，各計不得超過各種存欵總額十分之四。推立法本意；旨在獎勵多收爲期較久之定期存欵，俾資金得有充分運用之機會，庶市面變化時；不致激起提存風潮，用意不可爲不深，但經如此呆板規定，適足予儲蓄銀行及存户以非常之困難。就銀行言，彼分支行遍於各埠者，賬目不易彙總，核計爲難，即無分支行之設立，或分支行之賬目易於合併計算者，對於此項存欵比例，不特今日與明日不同，抑且一日之中，每經一筆存欵之收付，其比例即起相當之變動，欲時時吻合本法規定之限額，彌覺其難。若稍掉輕心，又有本法第十六條之罰則臨於其後，將使銀行當局疲於奔命矣。就存户言，活期存欵每户限定不得逾五千元，彼固可以自爲仲縮。若銀行收受活期存欵，不得超過百分之四十之規定，在彼旣無從預知其手中之金錢，能否不被銀行摒斥，幸而電話接洽，尙可收存，携欵往存，則因另一存户之先到存入，不獲收受，或則限額尙餘一百十一元一角一分，彼以二千元往，銀行收其百餘金，而返其一千八百八十八元八角九分，設因此往返周折，發生盜竊遺失等情事，則存户因此所受之損失，殆將無從索償。即不然，因手續之麻煩，從而懈其儲蓄之志，當非立法者獎勵儲蓄之初心。故竊以爲此項限額之規定，實則無多，窒碍殊甚，似以設法變通爲宜。而本法第八條資金投放，對於存欵數額之比例，其計算之困難，同坐是病，均有商榷之餘地也。</p>
<p>三、不動產能束購入關於儲蓄銀行能否購入不動產問題，論者或可或否，要皆有相當理由。而本法特點，重在使目前集中都市之資金；重返農村，故祗許不動產之受押，而不許不動產之購買，以免啟都市地產投機之風，其立意未始不美。然立法原期垂諸久遠，不若醫生之開藥方，專就眼前病症下藥。查各國儲蓄銀行法，大都准許購置相當成數之不動產。良以儲蓄存欵，定期居多，爲期較長，在存欵未曾到期之前，似不妨許其於危險分散原則之下，酌量投放於地產事業。故凡有繼續確實收益之不動產，似不妨許儲蓄銀行投資。惟爲防止購置過濫，使資金陷於呆滯及助長地產投機起見，不可不有相當之限制耳。</p>
<p>四、農村放欵問題本法第八條規定儲蓄銀行對於農村合作社及農產物之質押放欵。不得少於存欵總額五分之一云云。其扶植農村。可謂達於極點。有助於内地經濟之復興者甚大是爲本法之惟一特色。顧吾人聞見所及。方今農村合作社之組織。似獨未臻十分健全。且各處農村有此組織者。尙居少數。對之入欵。殊覺不易。至農產物究以何者爲標凖。亦猶有待於施行法之解釋。而限定儲蓄銀行此類放欵，不得少於存欵總額五分之一，更無異予儲蓄銀行以一難題目。就上海論，估計各行儲蓄嘏欵，總額當不下二萬萬元。即須騰出四千萬元，從事於此類放欵。試問偌大巨欵，是否咄嗟可以押放完竣。吾人固知内地金融涸竭；農村亟待救濟。然銀行與慈善救濟會性質不同，放欵與散賑情形逈别。儲蓄銀行之資金，不文半文，盡是存户汗血，在未有安全之保障與完密之計畫以前，似未便貿然向農村投放。年來雖有不少銀行，辦理農村放欵，卓著成效，但其數至多不過數萬至數十萬而止。至其資金之來源，大都撥自特種公積或贏餘，無一來自儲蓄資金。蓋所以防無法收回時，不至損及股東或存户之利益也。故吾人之意，以爲規定儲蓄銀行之資金，應從事於農產品及農村合作社之質押放欵，則可；若必限以不得少於存欵幾分之幾，是直以儲户之汗血，爲救濟農村之代價。不幸辦理未善，資金無着，則今後誰復肯以餘蓄存入儲蓄銀行乎？</p>
<p>五、存放同業限額問題本法第八條規定儲蓄銀行存放其他銀行之欵，不得超過其存欵總額十五分之一。按本法以許普通銀行兼營儲蓄銀行之故，爲防止普通銀行商業部挪用儲蓄資金起見，特加以嚴格之限制，誠屬允當。但所謂存放其他銀行者；顯指本行以外之一切同業而言。在吾國銀行習慣，此等存放，其性質實與現金無異，一遇需要，隨時可以提用。而受存之家，亦必有相當凖備，隨時可以償還，從無挪用作長期投資之用。通例咸以存放同業，與現金同樣視爲流動資產。故欲使儲蓄銀行多備流動資產起見，對於本行商業部存欵，限額不妨稍嚴。至存放其他同業，似不必過於限制。（雖但書有以政府公債爲質者，不在此限之規定，究屬不切實際，與銀行慣例未合，）今設有一儲蓄銀行收有存欵三百萬元，其資金之運用，悉按本法妥爲支配，則其存放同業之欵，不過二十萬元，收購他銀行承兌票據，不過十五萬元，（其實目下銀行承兌票據極少，收購更屬無從，）再加現金二十萬元，而負債方面，活期存欵占一百二十萬元，一旦市面突生變故，證劵暴跌，質押品無從轉押，則此五十五萬之活動資金，尙不足應付半數活期存户之提存。故此等無彈性之限制辦法，竊以爲似有研究之餘地也。</p>
<p>六、重員負責問題本法十五條規定儲蓄銀行之財產，不足償還各儲户債務時董事監察人應負連帶無限責任，所以予儲户以穏固之保障，兼亦促進董監事自知職責之重，盡心治事，無負股東委託，其用意自屬甚善。顧吾人之意，以爲本法對於儲蓄資金之運用，已有嚴密之規定，使董監事不能遵照本法處理業務，致令銀行破產，或所有財產不足應付儲户債務時，彼董監事自屬咎無可辭。若平日處理行務，一以本法爲凖則，恪恭將事，不幸市面變化，質押品跌價；如乾繭由六十餘元跌至二十餘元，白米由十餘元跌至五六元，以及如九一八時債劵之跌至二三折，以致銀行無法支持，宣告破產，則其咎不在董監事之失職，遽以連帶無限責任相加。似失事理之平。且資金之運用，若無本法規定，則董監事可就其自稔爲穏妥者而投放之，則萬一資金喪失，彼董監事变决自咎其見理之不明，致有此失，科以責任，要亦甘受。若如本法處處加以限制，加以强迫，則彼除奉行法令外，固不負其他責任也。故關於此點，似於施行法上，亦不可不加以相當之修正也。</p>
<p>要之本法較之前法儲蓄銀行則例，及歷次草案，完善多多，堪稱爲一有價値之法律。亦惟正因吾人欽佩之深；輙敢貢其愚見，以期窒碍盡去，推行無阻，全國民衆，均將蒙其保障，豈特儲蓄事業之賴其維護已哉。</p>
<h3>戰時財政與超利得稅</h3>
<p>— 陳鴻根</p>
<p>▲（一）引言</p>
<p>『戰時財政』，泛言之，即爲戰爭時代之一種政事。詳言之，即以戰時之政府收支作爲手段，利用政治力量控制社會之經濟，以謀應付需要，爲全國人民造最大之福利。戰時財政之最要任務爲籌軍費。軍費爲國家之非常支出故必以非常收入充之。籌軍費之辦法不外人民自運與政府發動二種。前者純係樂捐性質，所謂『簞食壺漿，以迎王師』。惟是此項收入，可少而不可多，可暫而不可久，非籌劃軍費之主要辦法。由政府發動者不外加稅發鈔借債及勒捐數種。其中勒捐一法若行於地小兵多之域，必致「竭澤而漁」，使地方經濟頻於破產。『發鈔』使貧富一律擔負戰費，易使幣價跌落，物價飛騰，擾亂社會。其餘加稅借債二法，實爲戰費之主要來源各國在戰時類多採用之。中國今日内有殘餘軍閥及共匪之盤據，用兵頻繁。外有强鄰之覬𧢢，戰爭可期而待。然則戰時財政之補救，其將出之於借債抑將謀之於加稅。加稅一途在歐戰時丹麥瑞典英美等皆見施行，然其流弊至大。戰費需要急，而抽稅之事綏，是以難於接濟，一也。戰時人民經濟能力低，難以負擔重稅，而戰後反使减輕擔負，前後不均，二也。戰爭非一朝一夕可以結束，延時愈久，所費愈大，稅亦愈重，人民必不堪其苦，三也。此乃戰時加稅一般之弊害。茲即以歐戰時最流行之超利得稅加以剖解，以示我國戰時財政解决之途徑焉。</p>
<p>（二）超利得稅Ｅxcee　Profit　Tax之　釋　　超利得稅由戰時利得稅Ｗar　Profit　Tax銳變而來，同爲歐洲大戰之副產物，茲依超利得稅之性質而分别闡明如次。</p>
<p>超利得稅爲遺產稅說丨有以此類稅劃爲遺產稅者。然考各國法制所載，凡經濟行爲起於前人之身，其他個人恒能因其事件享受財產之利得者，所㣲稅始爲遺產稅。超利得稅實爲本身經濟行爲所發生之結果，使企業家不從事生產則利潤何從而來，更無論超利得矣。故二者實不可比擬。</p>
<p>超利得稅爲特别捐欵說丨超利得稅之目的係在以個人之財力輔助政府，頗有與特别捐欵相似之處。亞丹姆斯即主張斯說，惟若詳爲研析，則發現二者亦有其差異在。特别捐欵係公共團體爲人民幸福計，建設新營造物，需用巨欵時對於其受惠者按其受惠程度分别徵收之租稅，乃以特别補償爲原則。今者超利得稅則非爲私人之受惠而徵，二者之區别彰彰明矣。</p>
<p>超利得稅爲增値稅說丨說者或以爲利潤在戰時之所以超過標凖者，良由於當時貨物供給之减少、通貨之膨脹、與夫社會情形之變遷，生產者之利潤因以提高，以此觀之，盈利稅實爲增値稅之一種，此說亦難能盡善。夫土地之增價，地主不加絲毫之力於其間，而坐收其高利。至於超利得則非盡屬不勞而獲。</p>
<p>超利得稅爲業稅說丨錫力格曼以爲租稅種類雖繁，大别之不外三大範圍（甲）對財產或個人之收入。（乙）對個人或公司。（丙）對人或事物。對事物中又分爲土地資本及營業三項。而超利得稅實營業之一種。故其言曰『超利得稅之對象乃爲營業之本身而非從事於營業之人有如紐約之地產稅與其地主鮮有關係也」。</p>
<p>綜核以上諸說，自以最後可較近似，惟吾人猶需認識超利得稅徵收之對象非企業之總收入或凈餘，而乃限於其過額之盈利。明乎此，</p>
<p>則不至陷於籠統之謬誤。</p>
<p>（三）超利得稅產生之背景</p>
<p>國用繁丨溯自二十世紀以來，歐美各國久懷必戰之心，莫不盡厥力以凖備。及至戰爭爆發，一再覊延，戰費旣屬浩繁，財力自形告乏。故其取民也不得不亟。政府於原有稅收之外，必另謀開源之道，自是超利得稅乃應運而生矣。</p>
<p>物價之高漲丨工業停頓，生產品减少，通貨膨脹，俱爲促成物價高漲之原因。當德國被封銷以後，僅餘丹麥及瑞典二國之通路。此二國之商品遂源源運至德意志，獲利至厚。乃遭政府之覬覦，首先創制超利得稅。不數月間各國一致風行。</p>
<p>國民之愛國熱誠丨自來人民之於義師，莫不樂於輸將，史籍所載，己累見不鮮。超利得稅一起而羣効，然施行之初，各國人民猶未聞有怨言者，此其故矣。</p>
<p>（四）超利得稅之理論</p>
<p>犧牲說丨超利得稅之存在，並非以政府對人民之役務交換之觀念，前已言之，國家遇有戰事，凡屬國民自應盡力扶助之，否則一旦戰敗，國且不存，家將焉保，超利得旣係國家所造成之偶然獲得，自應輸納其一部分於政府，故喬治氏Ｌloyd　George氏之言曰「政府際此通貨</p>
<p>膨脹，國祚垂危之時，亟宜盡量激勵人民勇爲輸將，吾人當不難於戰時增高租稅，於戰後削平之」。</p>
<p>平均財富說丨戰時物價之騰貴，由於社會之力量者不少。社會財富之總量不易變動，企業家高利剥削之餘，必致榨壓消費者，形成貧富懸殊之現象，故依社會之觀點應將此種超利得，奪之私人之手，而公之於社會。</p>
<p>人情說丨戰爭爲國家之創痛，亦猶個人身體之遭罹疾病，精神之受摧毀也，夫人有疾病，則必謀以診治之。使受刺激則必憮慰之，國民之與國家亦猶是也。非僅爲友誼之傾助，抑且繫本身之存亡，是以自人情之立塲言之，亦應</p>
<p>有超利得稅之存在。</p>
<p>（五）超利得稅實施之狀况</p>
<p>據斯探勃氏Ｊ·Ｃ·Ｓtamp調查，迄一九一七年三月止，已有十三國施行徵收超利得稅，可見推行之廣。今略陳英美二國實施之狀况以見一斑。</p>
<p>範圍丨英國自一九一四年以後，各物價格飛漲，翌年之十二月，即制定超利得稅，包括一切存在於帝國内（除農業及雇傭階級外）之超額利潤。美國於一九一七年三月施行聯邦政府超利得稅，包刮一切工商業及其他職業，一九一八年以後則僅限於公司之企業。</p>
<p>徵收之狀况丨</p>
<p>（Ａ）利潤之標凖丨此乃謂規定一定額之標凖，凡屬超過者即應徵以超利得稅，此標凖决定</p>
<p>之法有三：</p>
<p>（甲）數字上之决定丨英國乃係取戰前三年中任何二年之該企業利潤數値，平均數作爲標凖。如云一九一三一九一二兩年之平均値，美國規定凡利潤在三千元，外加其企業之投資利率八％以内者免稅。若係超過上述之額，即相當數額之超利得稅。</p>
<p>（乙）稅率丨即由政府規定一標凖之企業利率，如英國規定公司爲六％，他種營業組織爲七％或八％。美國爲八％。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）超利得稅之稅率丨英國制定凡利潤超過規定之利率或利潤數者，即對該超額部分徵四○丨八○％之超利得稅。一九一八年始確定稅率爲八○％。美國規定凡超過上述之界限額但猶未越其資本額之二○％者，稅率爲三○％。設其超過之額在其資本額二○％以上者，則稅率爲六五％。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）稅收之數値丨英國自施行超利得稅後，實收之總數達一、二八○、○○○磅。美國一九一七年合個人及公司企業之稅入總數爲一、八四三、八八五、五○五元。一九一八年只公司一項達二、五○五、五六五、九三九元。爲稅收最盛之時，其後乃日形削减。</p>
<p>超利得稅之廢除丨美國於一九一一年十二月宣布廢除，英國亦鑒於和約告成物價下降，於同年决然廢止此稅。</p>
<p>（六）超利得稅之評價</p>
<p>超利得稅施行之初，政府提倡之。學者從而鼓吹之，人民亦樂於輸將。各國卒以此增加歲收，其爲功也不淺矣。固一制度之優劣，不能以其一時之成敗度之，必詳爲檢討其理論之是否健全，原則之是否適合，施行之有無障礙，影響之爲善或惡，今即根據此數點以分析超利得稅。</p>
<p>理論上</p>
<p>（Ａ）犧牲說之不當丨犧牲之事雖不以報酬爲原則，但亦不能有害於擔負者。而無論帝制國及民主國之戰爭，往往無非由少數野心家激勵而成，生靈任其塗炭，財力任其耗費，無一非有利於人民也，以此而言犧牲吾不得其解矣。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）平均財富說之不當丨物價之騰貴，由於</p>
<p>社會之力固不少。然個人工作之能力與夫管理之効能，豈永不進步乎，今舉而認爲超額利潤，皆由社會之勢力所造成，是則社會勢力之範圍，其將無止境乎？</p>
<p>原則上之不當</p>
<p>（Ａ）不平等丨超利得稅對於戰前已經擴張或已形成高利潤以及獨資經營之企業，皆任其免稅。同一超利得，而有些不平等之待遇，不合租稅之原則。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）不普偏丨超利得稅僅包刮投資於企業之利潤，而置其他收入於不問。一若戰爭之責任只應用獲得超利得之人擔負，頗有違租稅普徧之原則。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）不確定丨超利得稅之資本額利潤額旣不易决定，投資之利率更形分歧，使徵收者難於</p>
<p>措置。</p>
<p>施行上之困難</p>
<p>（Ａ）標凖利率之不易决定丨</p>
<p>生產要素之變動丨若在戰爭開始後又加入新資本及人工，則舊有之利潤值必不能用爲計算之標凖，勢必以新要素一併加入計算，但如此又發生下列困難。</p>
<p>投資利率不易决定丨社會情形之改變影響經濟，舊有利率不能適用。欲訂新率，則在戰時各種企業之冒險性又不相等，極難正確。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）投資額之計算丨各國極不一致，有以實產爲範圍，而用上項利率計算其利潤者。更有以譽產及版權等，一併歸入計算者。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）逃稅丨不外下列數法：</p>
<p>提高職員薪俸丨以此蒙蔽其一部分之盈利而减少稅之擔負。</p>
<p>提高其他費用。</p>
<p>增加廣告費丨其功在一方面可以免部分之稅，同時以廣告之影響，於此稅旣廢之後必能獲銷路推廣之効。</p>
<p>超利得稅所生之影響</p>
<p>（Ａ）經濟上</p>
<p>摧殘小企業丨大企業持其雄厚之資本，廣漠之銷路，故其所定利率較低。而小企業之利率則往往超過標凖利率。今依超利得稅之辦法，則大企業反能倖免，而小企業以無利可圖，必</p>
<p>自沒落。</p>
<p>爲害冒險性較大之企業丨冒險性較大之企業，以收益不確定，故其所定投資利率特高，以備爲損失時期之補償。而超利得稅僅片面認識其高利之時期，殊屬不當。</p>
<p>减少投資及資本之積蓄丨企業家以賦稅繁重，無高利可圖，必相率收回其資本。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）社會的</p>
<p>對於生活程度之影響丨企業家受課稅之損失後，必謀所以補償之道。在專利事業之企業家，猶可保持其原有之價格。（專利物品不宜加價）而在一般之生產者，則必轉嫁之於消費者。因以减低社會之消費能力與生活程度。</p>
<p>影響社會福利丨當超利得稅盛行之際，企業家多停頓或削减其事業以待稅率之减輕或廢除。如此則一切之市塲活動驟形冷落，人民之享受銳减。</p>
<p>（七）結論</p>
<p>超利得稅起於戰時財政之危困，然其不足爲良好之稅制已如上述，吾以爲急濟戰時財政最宜之策，莫如借債。借債可以統籌大量欵項，以符大宗軍費之用，其利一也。借欵之攤還在戰後，待社會經濟能力恢復後，使人民擔負戰時之費，故不覺其苦，其利二也。借欵之對象爲富人，其貸欵爲投機性質，故不致影響於其一般人民之經濟狀况，其利三也。戰費來自借欵，則不致侵越經常費，各方行政與事業無停頓之虞，其利四也。有此四利，則戰時財政解决之道，合舉債其將安適？</p>

<h3>兒童文藝</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>據說今年是兒童幸福年，可是，過了大半年，兒童也不見比以先幸福得多少。也許，在有的地方，還會比較不幸福些。</p>
<p>在東北，聽說，在去年冬天，好些小孩子，活活的，被凍死了。失業，失學的，還不算數。在内地，今年的天旱水澇，更助長了列强侵凌下的中國社會破產，自然，兒童不不福的氣運，是要日趨發展的。</p>
<p>兒童的幸福，根本不是幾句空談能造成的。根本的解民，現在是談不到。現在，我們是應當教養陶育兒童，使之能走上爲自己求幸福的途逕。</p>
<p>現在，教會學校，還是用神在麻醉兒童。良好的小學教本，是寥寥無幾。而，小學生的讀物，又非常不够。就是環境較好的小孩子，都是時時刻刻地受無形的虐待，在不合理的陶養之下，日趨變質。貧苦者的兒女們，更不用說了。</p>
<p>普及兒童的教育，是必要的。普及兒童的文藝，是必要的。是應當制作合乎兒童需要的兒童文藝，而把它普及起來。是應當領導着兒童去創造自己的文藝。</p>
<p>新的兒童，需要新的文藝。但是，新的兒童文藝，不應是中世風的動物故事，或是理想化了的唯美的歌謠。在現階段的中國，是不要那種蒙蔽兒童眼睛的東西。促進兒童自覺，加進兒童的科學知識，啟開兒童的眼睛使之認識社會，了有自己的地位，是兒童文藝家所要履行的任務。那麽，現實的兒童文藝，是所要急須創造的了。</p>
<p>是需要用現實的主題，去創造新的兒童文藝的。新的童話，新的童謠，都宜有現實性。從帝國主義壓迫中國諸事實，「一九一八」，「一二八」，以及數年來東北民衆的慘苦生活中，我們是都可以汲出來新的兒童文藝的主題的。而，用那些有直一實性的主題」，制作出來新的兒童文藝作品來，是大大地可以教育中國兒童的。</p>
<p>新的兒童文藝的用語，自然，是要有大衆性的兒童言語（兒童大衆語），而不宜是少數者的兒童的話語。新的童謠童歌，是須爲廣汎的兒童大衆所愛歌唱的。但是，作者更須領導大多數的兒童，趨向於創造新的科學的言語。停留於現有的兒童語言狀態而不使之前進，是不够的。</p>
<p>報載，日本派了童謠詩人野口雨情到了「滿洲國」。據說，是有重大的文藝的使命。可是，帝國使用着它的御用童謠詩人麻醉兒童之這件事，是不是促使我們要反省一下呢？我們是需要有我們的新的兒童文藝家，以解放中國民衆爲其基本的任務的。</p>
<h3>南行小記（下）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>長湖盡處是一帶蜿蜿蜒蜒的雁蕩山餘脈，小小的山城便在羣山的一個缺口處建造着。北城的許多建築物，遠遠地看見。那有石欄杆的弓形石橋，像一個大門，跨在長湖的將盡處。橋的左右，十分對稱。榕樹是對立的，背後的兩座山，也是相差不遠的形狀。過橋便是湖心亭，我已置身於數年來夢想中的故鄉了。</p>
<p>許多新鮮事物，居然在四年以内出現了。長途電話已通達到這個極僻遠的縣份，電報局以至於無綫電局，也因爲福建事變而設立起來。汽車路在年底可以造到，現在官吏正在索勒着强制派定的公路捐。雁蕩山快要成爲風影區，要招引大都市的游客來觀光。新生活運動的徽號到處貼着，有點像美國的藍鷹標幟。街道似乎比以前乾凈些，人民比以有更窮。</p>
<p>社會秩序還是那樣的不安。當我到家的一日，便聽到一位富農被綁受害的消息。一千畝田左右的算是絶頂的富豪，退伍兵和散佈着的紅黨似乎有些組織。福建方面被擊散的十九路軍隊伍，三三五五的跑過來，向各家各户討路費。江西方面來的難民，湖南籍的散座，來去不絶，他們有時同公安局的職員同出討錢，有時用高壓的手段，向民間勒索。人民被勒慣了，漸漸不以此爲稀奇。被鴉片浸黑了的乞丐和流亡會坐在你的門内不去，硬要多少錢；聽說連政府都害怕他們。</p>
<p>大學畢業的沒有事在家，中學畢業的因小學教師位置不够而無出路。有錢的在家抽起鴉片來，無錢的也自鳴風流，抽上鴉片來裝頽廢，據說許多文學家也曾抽鴉片的。談話中十九是對於現狀不滿，駡政府賣國，駡政府剥削人民、然而要他們來做當局，只怕賣國還利害些，剥削還毒辣些。那些忠厚一點的富家，日夜憂懼着綁票。鄉裏的住進城裏來，城裏的要住到上海住到杭州去。有錢的漸漸去盡了，無錢的在地方上依舊作孽。我不信在這個社會上有多少純潔的人存在。</p>
<p>農產物價錢大跌，漁家的收穫尤其受打擊。現金在市面漸漸的枯涸，那些裝璜講究些的舖子，表面上很可觀，實際上是虧着本而開門的，人民購買力薄弱極了，大家對於每小洋一角可買到一斤半的黄魚，也認爲奢侈品。重重的捐稅，把小貧化爲大貧。縣長挨家逐户的去索公路捐，有幾千元財產的便要攤一百元，人民駡政府是綁票，政府駡人民不知建設事業之重要。</p>
<p>這一個小小的城市，在兵災匪禍見慣了的各縣來揣度，應該是極樂世界。十多年來，牠沒有受到什麽很大的水災旱災，牠雖然一度受到匪禍，一度經赤匪之攻入，然而沒有受到多大損失。可是中國人的命運，到處是一樣的，經濟的惡潮，是不分縣界省界的。政府，像浙江省政府，不是不想做點事業的，然而人民負擔力是這樣的薄弱，在窮困中掙扎不了的他們，怎樣能了解政府，怎樣能原諒他們强制的給以負擔。經濟，要有計畫，應當有整個的計畫，片面的發展容易成爲偏枯之病，用人力車夫來拉火車，是很難見效的。</p>
<p>黄包車的鈴聲送我到家園，我仿彿在做夢，我害怕我還在做夢。爸爸妈妈和妹妹看見了我，眞不知第一句說什麽話才好。可惜三個妹妹的學校中沒有結束，我們一家七個人還不能團聚。在妹妹在正月便畢業了，她在家等待我的歸來已經半年。她說她已預備好棕子，今年可在家同過端陽節了。</p>
<p>七月十三日，追記於上海</p>
<h3>父母的心</h3>
<p>— 呂紹光</p>
<p>媽媽坐在櫈子上，</p>
<p>替妹妹打毛繩衣；</p>
<p>搖籃里的弟弟，</p>
<p>牙牙的在學語；</p>
<p>慈母的心突然起了懷疑：難道這一生全爲了兒女？</p>
<p>窮苦的爸爸，</p>
<p>愁着臉，憊弱地</p>
<p>在庭前踱來又踱去，</p>
<p>憂慮現自他的眼簾：</p>
<p>孩子們一天天大了，</p>
<p>將來怎末好呢？······</p>
<h3>談馬來都市（續）</h3>
<p>檳榔嶼</p>
<p>檳榔嶼（Ｐenang），雖然底裏是和新嘉坡同其内容，然而牠的面目却是秀麗的。</p>
<p>檳榔嶼，是人間的樂園。檳榔嶼是把人間的罪惡深深地掩藏着的。</p>
<p>檳榔嶼風影秀麗，（詳拙作南國的秀嶼。）然而檳榔嶼的「樂土」却是預備爲未來的人類享受的。檳榔嶼是在綠色上塗上灰色，檳榔嶼的光明是被黑暗包裹着的。</p>
<h3>馬六甲</h3>
<p>馬六甲（Ｍalaga），面臨馬六甲海峽。具有污穢的街道，和頽舊的古蹟。</p>
<p>你可以從馬六甲看出過去英，荷爭雄的遺跡；你可以從馬六甲城堡的遺址想像出當時殖民地的爭奪戰是怎樣地激烈。而現在，這種爭奪的目標旣已轉移，（其轉向中國乎？）而武器也日新月異了。</p>
<p>馬六甲是富於漁船的。在馬六甲的海上，你可以看見帆檣是不住地在海浪汹湧的海上飄揚着。</p>
<p>馬六甲的中國人據說是最爲馬來化的，正和檳榔嶼的華僑相反。他們有許多是不會說中國語；他們用手抓飯吃；他們認倫敦爲「祖家」：他們是不曉得中國在什麽地方的。這或者是中國人在這裏殖民的歷史較久的緣故罷？近來聽說由於僑民的努力，情形是比較有點改進了。</p>
<p>馬六甲在歷史上現在是歸於沒落了的。她已經失去了她過去的光榮，她已經漸漸地不爲人所重視。歷史是變化着的，而地和人，可不能不跟着變化</p>
<p>呀！</p>
<p>怡保</p>
<p>怡何（Ｉpoh）一個錫鑛區的都市。屬於大霹靂。</p>
<p>是一個不大的都市。然而當錫米和橡皮的價格在歐，美的市塲上升跌的時候，人間的被操縱的魄儡是曾在這裏演過悲劇和喜劇的。</p>
<p>交通總算扼要：西由聯邦鐵道可通暹羅的國境，東北由馬來聯邦的鐵道直達擯榔嶼，南經吉隆坡以達英皇的代表，殖民地總督所在地丨新加坡。</p>
<p>怡保有奇洞。不遠的太平（Ｔaiping）有太平湖都很有名。</p>

<p>靑年絶望地將手臂一攤，回答一聲：「沒有做好。」</p>
<p>「你在說笑話了！」</p>
<p>「確是沒有做好。」</p>
<p>「什麽？這個不興！這個不興！」那個人倒在一張椅子裏，打他的外套下面伸出一雙指頭像爪樣的污手來，一邊微帶靑色的眼睛的膧人在他紅而逢鬆的眉毛底下變得大了起來。</p>
<p>「這個不興！」他續說道。「這時候報紙應當早出來了。要和報紙出來而沒有攻擊拉費爾，伯加尼的文章我就完結了。啊！爲什麽我自己不曉得寫呢？可憐的我呀！我自害自了！今天是這個劇烈的選舉競爭的緊要關頭。我應該到手錢的，現在却反而要··反而要挨打了，他們要說我是騙子丨丨是個賣友的人。你才是賣友的人丨丨你才是丨丨你才是丨丨」</p>
<p>「不要這樣子，唐，琴那利諾，請安靜下來吧！··我並非賣友，我實不知道怎樣來寫這</p>
<p>篇預約的稿子。我對於拉費爾，柏加尼本人老以爲是很不差，我相信他是個好人。可是我依然有着完成我的工作，誹謗他，毁壞他，誣陷他的意志。但是就在這構思想草成荒誕無稽的罪狀時候，我却找不到一絲一毫的觀念。我連音都不會拼丨丨連組成字的一個一個字母都連不攏來。」</p>
<p>「去問旁人，不要向我來零賣你良心的猶豫吧！你是天生的謗毀者，我們知道你！」</p>
<p>「我是天生的謗毀者？對，我祇好回答你對！」</p>
<p>當這樣說着，靑年聲調哀鬱自悲地咳着嗽，一面那個人又再自悲自嘆起來：</p>
<p>「啊，報紙丨報紙！我將怎麽辦呢？可憐的我！可憐的我！怎樣的一種恥辱！怎樣的一件不名譽事！這就是你所以報答我給了你工作做，給了你錢養活。這是你的感激。賣友的人！暗殺的人！我賭聲咒，要如我再給你機會賺半個便士的話，唾我的臉好了。你可以打今天開頭去熬受飢餓，要如你去討飯，不見得有人會賞賜你！啊，可憐的我！他們要打我！他們要說我是騙子，說我比騙子還壞的名字。我話已經說出了口。怎樣的屈辱！怎樣的不幸！討飯，不錯，丨現在，就去討飯，求人家做個好事！你可以有希望！」</p>

<h3>傷寒發揮三（下）</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>柯氏之地面論曰。「腰以上爲三陽地面。三陽主外而本乎裏。心者。三陽夾界之地也。内由心胸。外自巔頂。前至額顱。後至肩背。下及乎足。内合膀胱。是太陽地面。··内自心胸。至胃及腸。外自頭顱。由面及腹。下及於足。是陽明地面。由心之咽。出口類。上耳目。斜至巔。外至脇，内屢膽。是少陽地面。··腰以下爲三陰地面。三陰主裏而不及外。腹者。三陰來界之地也。自腹由脾及二腸魄門。爲太陰地面。自腹至兩腎及膀胱溺道。爲少陰地面。自腹由肝上隔至心。從脇肋下及於小腸宗筋。爲厥陰地面」。由此言觀之。旣曰腰以上爲三陽地面矣。而又謂太陽及陽明之地面下及於足。是自亂其例也。其以出口頰上耳目至巔爲少陽地面。卽靈樞經絡篇膽足少陽之脈。起於目銳眥。上抵頭角。下耳後。下加頰車之文也。其以由肝上隔至心。從脇肋下及於小腸宗筋。爲厥陰地面。卽經脈篇肚足厥陰之脈。過陰器。貫隔布脇肋。其支者。從肝别貫膈之文也。然則柯氏所言六經地面。安在其非經絡之經乎。眞所謂</p>
<p>持之無故。方之不能成理者矣。</p>
<p>柯氏又曰。「心爲六經之主。故六經皆有心煩之證」。又曰「心憤憤。心惕惕。心中懊憹。一切虚煩。皆屬陽明。以心居陽明地面也」。又曰「今傷守書，皆以膀胱爲太陽。故有傳足不傳手之謬，不知仲景書。只宗陰陽之大法。不拘陰陽之經絡也。··仲影以心爲太陽。故得外統一身之氣血。内行五臓六府之經隧」。觀乎此等言論，柯氏旣以心爲太陽，又謂心爲六經之主。又以爲心居陽明之地面。舉棋不定。自相矛盾。其樹木不固。立說無主。誕妄甚明。豈待辨哉。</p>
<p>總而言之。傷寒六經自王叔和成無已朱奉議以來。皆據經絡爲言。而陽</p>
<p>明厥陰之義。與内經不合。方中行起而易以體層之内外及下下。以由外而内說</p>
<p>三陽。以自下而上說三陰。魏荔彤和之。更附會之以五行之說。而仍不可通也。至柯韻伯。又易以地面之說。而仍依徊於經絡之間。以心爲太陽。而闢足膀胱經爲太陽之言。然無能自堅其說也。此外則或方傳經。或言不傳。有言再傳者。成無已是也。有方不再傳者。閔芝慶是也。（見魏荔彤傷寒論本義）或計日數。一日太陽受之。二日陽明受之之類是也。或謂不可拘以日數。（閔芝慶）且又有所謂循經傳。越經傳。誤下傳。循經得度傳等名。（李東垣）凡此皆不能打破六經之羅網。從而爲之詞也。</p>
<p>夫經絡之妄謬。今已盡人知之。陰陽五行之說。更不必論。體層之言。亦爲空想。今之行皮下注射者。不須臾而藥力周於身矣。豈待一二日而始傳裏哉。卽此可以明體層之說之非矣。地面之論。羗無故實。求之古訓。旣無所據。按之實物。又無所徵。其爲臆度之談。不俟辨而其妄可知矣。吾故曰。傷寒論之最無意義者。六經之說也。六經之說破。而所謂六經分綱。六經遞傳之說。亦隨之而澌滅。而後傷寒論之糾葛紛擾。可以一舉而肅淸之矣。夫如是。然後可以說傷寒論。然後可以說傳染病。</p>
<h3>再談通信問病之弊</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>余曾於本刊著文論通信問病之利害，其意以爲病症非親臨診察，不能有正確之診斷與處方，若祇憑病者一紙來書，卽與以治療上之答復，其危險有不可勝言者。惟當時所述，有未盡者數事，茲再分别陳之：</p>
<p>（一）問題之性質各殊能盡答否醫之科目不一，而各科皆有其專門，决非一人之力所能兼長者也。今通信所問之病，種類至雜，解答者若取「知之爲知之，不知爲不知」之態度，則消滅病人之信仰，若取「强不知以爲知」之態度，而一槪含糊籠統以答之，則良心之責備難逃，故通信問病云者，無論解答者之學識如何，决非一人之力所能勝任，此其</p>
<p>一。</p>
<p>（二）署名於標題之下，無吸引病人之嫌否醫乃仁術，古有明言，通信答病，似爲仁者之行爲，蓋以寳貴之光陰，用於救人事業也。雖然，春灰有誅心之論，言善惡之分，在其動機之純正與否。今若署名於標題之下，殊難免吸引病人之嫌，蓋病者於答復未能滿足之時，均有前來就診之傾向，此種嫌疑，又安能自白於公衆乎？此其二。</p>
<p>（三）介紹外藥，無爲外商作廣告宣傳之嫌否外藥傾銷，年甚一年，究其手段，開多利用中國醫師爲其宣傳。近有一二報紙之醫藥附刋，似卽專爲推銷外藥而設，其答復中所開列之藥品，類皆某某洋行之出品，此種爲虎作倀之手段，則更等而下之，不足責矣！此其三。</p>
<p>綜上三點。聊爲前文之補充，總之，通信問病，其利極微，而其害極大，爲保持醫界之尊嚴計，爲免除病家之危險計，本市醫師公會最近議决將其出版物之醫藥顧問欄毅然取銷，此所希望於其他各報仿而行之者也。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識（續）</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（六）夏天眼睛的保護法</p>
<p>這幾天人人呌苦的。就是一個「熱」字因熱而中暑症和胃腸炎。亦因之而多。所以時疫醫院也就常常掛着客滿的牌子。一般講衛生的人。早已宣布戒嚴。實行像注射霍亂預防液，重蔬食，戒暈食，滅蠅蚊等等。這都是夏天應當做的事件。不過對於眼睛的衛生。往往沒有顧到。未嘗不是美中不足的一件事體。我現在把他應當注意的幾點講一講。</p>
<p>一，烈日當空，光綫過强的時候。最好勿多用目力。因爲眼睛的調節機能。容易疲勞。發生充血。</p>
<p>二，出外過有强光烈日的時候。宜戴有色的眼鏡（深黄色或墨晶色）。可以防止兩眼感受强烈光綫的刺戟。同時間接的免去從光綫刺戟發生的結膜病。</p>
<p>三，晚上無論讀書或寫字的時亿。電燈不必過亮。更宜用有色燈泡。可避去强光刺戟眼睛。</p>
<p>四，夏天流汗多的時候。往往流入眼内。眼内受着汗液的刺戟。常作充血的原因。所以夏天發生結膜炎的人。似乎以勞力者爲多。或者也許是因爲這個道理。要預防這個刺戟。就是不要使液流入眼内。</p>
<p>五，飲食物應當選擇無刺戟性者。像</p>
<p>酒類，香菜，茄辣，胡椒等。都是少食爲妙的東西。因爲也可反射刺戟眼内。發生充血。</p>
<p>六，務必天天有一次通暢的大便。如果閉結的時候。每晨或臨睡冲服一二匙鹽類物。像久大精鹽，Ｅuo果子鹽，别孝勃天然水果鹽Ｂishop’s　Narural　Fruit　Saline），卡兒司泉鹽（Ｃarlsbadsalz）等。都可以購服的。除了减少眼病的機會。同時還可以免却一切胃腸病的原因呢。</p>
<p>七，自己若有沙眼。最好不要到公共游泳池去游泳。免得傳染給人家。這也是一種個人道德。照游泳池的規則。是要醫師證明。方可參加游泳。像上海靑年會早已實行這條辦法了。</p>
<p>八，本來患有眼病的人。大槪到了夏天。常常感覺病情增劇。此時應當急速囑托專家詳細診療。</p>
<h3>關於胎盤及臍帶之談話（下）</h3>
<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>（五）胎盤之治療效能</p>
<p>胎盤之有催乳·調經·促進子宮發育及補益一般虚弱等效能。已爲現代醫家所公認。最近更有胎盤注射劑可以治療麻疹之報告。禮來（Lilly）藥廠。有胎盤粉製劑。皮拉（Ｂyla）藥廠（百部洋行經理）有Ｐlaceatine丸劑及注射劑。律須</p>
<p>德（Ｒichter）藥廠之出品　Ｈormo　GlandＬactagogum催乳劑中。亦以胎盤爲主要成分。然此種胎盤。類皆牛馬等之大動物者。國藥肆中。本有貓胞發售。本草綱目。亦有關於人胞之記載。是國人早已知其效能之明證也。特因獲得非易。不能廣爲應用耳。然根據生物學的原則。異種臟器蛋白質之毒作用。必較同種臟器蛋白質之毒作用爲劇。故人類應食人類之胎盤。而尤以產婦自食其胎盤爲最宜。貓犬牛馬之自食其胎盤者。决</p>
<p>非自潔之目的己也。</p>
<p>（六）歷來胎盤之處置法</p>
<p>胎盤爲胎兒維持生活之要器。故產後雖已脫離關係。類似廢物。然以感表的作用言之。似亦不當輕易抛棄。我國處理胎盤之法。有投於河海者。有棄於郊野者。有與石灰共入瓦罐。而置於床下者。有埋入圭中者。有投於恭桶或坑厠者。有用火焚却者。著者以爲裝入瓦罐。久必棄之。投入河海。亦不過充魚類之食品。棄於郊野卒爲犬貓所嚙食。埋入泥土。投於坑厠。亦終不免供蛆蟲之吮食。與其與動物食。曷不與人類食之。而迷信者流。造作讕言。以爲與人食。則有損於該兒之健康。眞百索而不解矣。</p>
<p>（七）人食胎盤法律上應否規定禁止</p>
<p>我國舊俗。因牛爲助耕之獸。蛙爲益農動物。故有終身不忍食其肉者。前淸國律。亦有禁宰耕牛。禁售蛙肉之明文。孟子早，數罟不入洿池。是非久禁之意。特祗時間問題耳。換言之。得其用時則禁。失其用時則不禁。竊謂胎盤</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>之作用。僅在胎生時期。產生以後。則等諸敝屣矣。我旣取而食之。是廢物利用耳。何必禁爲。余嘗將胎盤供人煮食矣。副内亦嘗兩次自食之。其結果。認爲確有相當之效力。蓋因刺戟素本有耐熱與不耐熱二種也。民國十九年春。余參列日本第八次全國醫學聯合會時。曾與彼邦學者。談述胎盤之效用。而欲作進一步之研究。然卒因日本法律所不許。故遂中止。回國後。雖欲將產婦自食胎盤之意見。公諸社會。又恐引起誤會。而作輟。今葉阿小妄想還童。拾食孫兒胎盤因其媳泥於迷信。嘖有煩言。而卒有告子不孝之事實。爰作是篇。略抒宿見。查我國習俗。雖皆不食胎盤。然法律上確亦未見有禁食之規定。且古方早已旨爲藥用。竊謂將來法律規定時。不必泥拘於欲人之迷信焉。質之高明以爲如何。</p>
<p>（八）關於臍帶之談話</p>
<p>臍帶與胎盤之關係。猶唇之與齒也。臍帶者。連結胎兒與胎盤之索狀物也。乃脈靜脈一·臍動脈二·卵黄管殘留遺物·閉鎖尿管·Ｗahston氏膠樣質及膜羊鞘等所成。其長短在成熟兒。平均五○公分。直徑約一公分。呈螺旋狀。其方向。自胎兒側視之。以右向者爲常。其附着於胎盤之部位。有中央·（二○％）邊緣。（一四·五％）側方（六五％）及卵膜。（一四·五％）側方（六五％）及卵膜（○·五％）等數種，其效用。據現在所知。不過爲胎兒與母體間新陳代謝之通路。本草綱目。釋其名·曰命蒂。燒末服。能止痎瘧。（卽久瘧也）老他書云。後世人曰臍帶爲坎杰。亦曰坎氣。用以大補氣血則非也。本草從新。亦云除止瘧及敷臍瘡而已。據日本石原俊士氏研究之結果。知臍帶中有一種刺戟素。能使脫落膜細胞及共不完全分解產物。徹底分解者。氏以癌腫細胞。</p>
<p>異常嫩弱。其性頗與脫落膜細胞類似。故亦得藉該刺戟素而分解之學說。遂將該刺戟素提出。創製一藥。命其名。曰Ｐ·Ｏ·Ｕ·（必·治·瘉·）作爲癌之要藥。此外對於子宮陰道部糜爛。亦有特效云。據是以言。則用以大補氣血之說。或亦未可以全非矣。</p>
<h3>學科教授的衛生和兒童體格檢查（中）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（七月八日在民衆教育館演講稿）</p>
<p>檢查身體的結果，不僅在體育實施上有利益，就是在精神教育卽智育方面，也大大的可以利用。例如對於視力障礙或聽力障礙者，可以用大體黑板字或高聲的說明，使能充分了解。又像對於那些因爲全身和局部病患而致智力障礙或品行有缺點者，可以勸告他們的家長，注意監視；或施以特别的訓練。此外對於低以兒，學業不良兒，性行不良兒，的探討或摒除，都能從體格檢查着手的。</p>
<p>（乙）體格檢查的利用如果教育家能够大家切實施行體格檢查之後，更應當充分利用其檢查的成績。換一句話說就是：體格檢查是爲實用而施行，不是爲形式而施行的。</p>
<p>檢查體格有許多時候是早已註定他的利用目標的。像職業應試時的檢查，入學考試時的檢查，大家都已知道其利用方法了。現在可以不必講述。</p>
<p>我現在講的，是在學中兒童的定期體格檢查的利用法。可分個别的利用法，和統計的利用法。</p>
<p>（子）個别的利用法</p>
<p>要利用體格檢查的成績，必先把那些體格檢記錄表，整理，注意其中是否已經把各項目正確記入，有無遺漏。其後詳細觀察各項目而報告其結果給各兒童的家長，並行衛生的勸告。在學校中要充分應用之於日常教授訓練上。此外視必要而特别添置衛生的設備，尤其如就學前的檢查後倘發見難授學校作業者的時候，應該根據檢查醫的意見，加以就學暫緩或拒絶等的處置。若在臨時或定期檢查的時候，發見在學校者的疾病時，可以停授學科或令停學退學，或設法使疾病恢復缺點矯正等。</p>
<p>（Ａ）對於家庭的通知和勸告這就是把檢查的結果通知兒童的家長的方法。但單由形式的通知家庭，效力非常薄弱。實際須徹底加以衛生勸告，這時候除學校看護婦外，主任教員也應當再三訪問那兒童的家庭，並且懇切地勸告他們。如果教員不很熱心，効果一定難收</p>
<p>的。</p>
<h3>介紹光華國貨橡皮膏</h3>
<p>橡皮膏一物爲我國醫藥界及家庭所必需。用途極廣。惜國人不能自製。每年外貨輸入。不可數計。茲有光華製藥廠經多年之研究。製成橡皮膏一種。消毒精良。黏性耐久。洵屬國產佳品。光華廠設靶子路五百五十號。希望全國醫藥界。盡力提倡。亦挽回利權之一道也。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（十）（二）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>他是可以發生炎性滲出作用的，這裏面所可見的有多核性白血球，淋巴球，纖維素，和肺小泡的脫落上皮。至於結締組織的增生，結果係產出種種不同的細胞的；這裏面大槪可分别爲三種：第一是呈現各種形態的大細胞，所謂上皮狀細胞是。他的形狀，是或圓或長，或平或多角的。第二是多核的巨大細胞。第三是淋巴球。此三種細胞數目的多少，是不一定的，有時淋巴球是獨多的，有時係完全受上皮狀細胞的支配的，就是巨大細胞，有時也很多的，這就是「巨大細胞結核」一名之所自了。這前面的二種，是居於結核中心的；淋巴球則在旁邊，他包裏這結核，像一堵城墻似的。所以尋常一個結核，可分爲三重的；裏面是壞死組織，外面是上皮狀細胞，最外面是淋巴球。但淋巴球和上皮狀細胞的界限，有時並不見得十分顯着的。</p>
<p>關於一個完備構成的結核的性態，上面已經講過了；那末，此後的變化是如何的呢他起初是灰白色而透明的，差不多和粟料一樣的大小；末後漸漸的發育增大了，透明變爲溷濁了白色灰白色變爲黄色了，裏面又因營養缺乏的關係，細胞是壞死了，結果就構成了一種黄色的乾酪狀物質，這就是「乾酪變性」了。這一種變化，無論是滲出性結核或增生性結核，都是一樣的。他起初是在結核中心部分的，並且是限於局部的，在這個時期，周圍可發生結締組織的；這雙方的界限，是非常淸楚的。假使乾酪變性的狀態侬止了，這種結締組織，可變爲純粹含有纖維之結締組織的，所謂乾酪性纖維性結核是。此外，乾酪變性的部分，是很容易石灰化；這是一個很可喜的現象，因病灶藉此而轉愈，是很多見着的。</p>

<p>電信特刊</p>
<h3>電界之聲電文</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>利用電報，傳遞消息，消息之關鍵，不在報頭，不大報尾，而在中間的一段，稱曰電文。</p>
<p>電報之取費，根據規定章程，以字數爲單位（惟報頭十五個字得以五個字計値），故字數愈多，需費愈大，因此電文所包括之字數，爲發電人着想，實大有斟酌研究之必要。</p>
<p>在昔軍閥時代，各省秉政者，每對時局，好發通電，文出幕僚之手，引經據典，佶屈聱牙，意可數語盡之者，往往長篇累牘，此爲賣弄高才，實不宜於電報。近數年來，國人提倡白話，力求通俗，但辭旣淺顯，語助太我，明瞭則有之，經濟則未也，故社會上無論推行白話至何程度，以入電文，究屬少見，其原因殆由於此。</p>
<p>電報用以通信，考厥性質實與郵函無别，不過傳遞有遲速，計費各不同而</p>
<p>已，善撰電文者，字簡而意顯，拍發電報，旣覺迅捷，而又經濟，但一般力求省字者，盡量欲將電文縮短，反致意義糢糊，致成誤會斯則「過猶不及」，殊非得策。</p>
<p>電報局以字數作算，對電文之内容若何，未許顧問，况字數多則收入當更有進步，營業所在，殊無庸爲發報人多所計及，惟覘我國歷年來報務狀况，在政軍界所拍電報，率多長達百數或數百字者，（在昔每通千字以上者亦不在少），若普通商電或私人之電報，電文輒寥寥可數。軍政與商，本不容並論，字數多寡，更無從比衡，不過商人惜費，究屬事實，而官軍電報，受有優待，下筆不求甚簡，恐賢者亦所難免也。</p>
<p>官軍電之濫，極其弊不祗妨害收入，且亦擁塞綫路，致商電積受稽延。交部爲便利民衆，疏通報務着想，自不能不稍加取締，以爲制限（取締辦法，早有公佈）此舉當爲外界所深諒；惟電文冗長，影響於電報之傳遞，亦非淺尠，簡其所當簡，則於恊助通信，尤具利益，至官軍電本身，因電文字數旣减，到達時間，自必較速，雙方兼顧，莫善於此，斯則於取締之餘，更不能不深望於發寄官軍電者矣。</p>
<h3>雨節與電信工程</h3>
<p>— 汪啟堃</p>
<p>大江以南，夏初多雨，適値梅子黄時，故謂之梅雨。爲期約一月，雨量豐富，殊有益於水田；然百物生霉，亦有相當害處，電信工程亦頗受其影嚮。</p>
<p>電信内無綫電一項最爲通俗，通商大埠之大商店幾皆備無綫電收音機，以資招徠。收音機之欠佳者，其綫圈經過雨節後，卽生霉失效。非職業家所自製之收音機，於繞綫圈時尤易沾染汗漬，生霉漏電。故宜以洋乾漆溶於酒精内之溶液，塗於綫圈外，以防濕氣之侵入；惟市上酒精每含水分，難得純粹者，塗後反於絶緣有害。</p>
<p>電報機器大都結構簡單，尙鮮上述之弱點。電報綫路幾盡係架空裸綫，不無接近樹木之處，初夏樹木繁茂，枝葉遂與電報綫接觸，而使之發生障碍。况久雨之後，電綫之支持物（隔電子，扁担、木桿等）及樹枝皆濕透，更多漏電，混綫，地氣等阧碍，以致通信困難，甚或阻絶。</p>
<p>電話工程所受雨季之影響，最爲重大。以言綫路則較電報爲複雜，長途電話綫之環境與電報綫相同，惟電話綫以市内爲主，其裸銅綫與樹枝，建築物等等接觸機會較多，在雨季當然障碍更多。市内電話機於祼銅綫外，尙設有架空與地下電纜。春夏之交，蟲類繁殖，架空電纜每被其齧艳，一經雨水注入，全部失去功用。地下電纜之人孔及營道，在長江以南各地，每無形中變成下水道。久雨之後，其内積水盈溢，電纜之鉛皮久被污水浸淫，自易逐漸腐朽，終致不可收拾。以方機械則電話所用之綫圈多於無綫電，而以自動電話爲尤甚。市内電話例以回綫内一綫接地氣，如他一綫不問在局内或局外，因受濕而得地氣，電路卽完成，電路内之繼電器乃自行動作，或自行復原，以致障碍頻仍。局内防止之道，可嚴閉自動機器室之門窗，使内外隔絶，並燃點電爐電燈，使室内乾燥。自動電話局之長途台，測量台等之電氣機械與自動機器相接，雖另室辦事，亦不宜隨意開啟門窗，有時亦宜燃烘燈。常人如遇空氣陰濕，卽覺不快，若在黄梅天氣，乍晴乍雨，濕熱交并，更覺煩燥。自動電話局内担當相當職務之員工，此際更須扃處室内，爐燈薰蒸，其精神上之痛苦，寗待言喻，女性及神經質者尤易暈吐。次之，卑濕之地，如首都等處，箱籠橱桌上之銅質鎖鍊等物，經雨季後每自霉銹。電話機之裝設，或接近牆壁，或懸於牆上，所受濕氣較多，遂致其傳話器之炭精屑粘聚，或轉號器之彈簧腐蝕，或機内佈綫漏電，人手苟觸機件，卽感覺輕微之刺擊。諸如此類，電話用户旣常感不便，且亦莫明其故；在電話局方面則責言繁多，工作加增，且受無形的與有形的各項損失。</p>
<p>今年雨季各地多苦旱，上述難關自可無形消滅；惟恐入秋多雨，佐以暴風，則電信工程所受之影響，反較梅雨爲甚耳。</p>
<h3>海外交際電</h3>
<p>— 寄然</p>
<p>電報交際，在我國尙佔少數，本年交部，規定廉價，力圖推廣，雖具成效，但較諸海外交際電之繁，利用者之多，自不能相提並論；蓋歐美社交，以發電爲尋常之事，喜慶弔唁，固無論已，卽男女之間，遠道相隔，互通情愫，相期約會，亦往往以電報出之，濃情密意，受者所得之慰藉爲何如哉？</p>
<p>至於政界名人，社會巨子，以及科學家藝術家等，一遇可喜可賀可歌可泣之事，往往交際電如雪片飛來，電局爲之增加工作，綫路爲之發行擁擠，此種現象，頗屬常見，茲舉一事，讀者當亦爲之咋舌也。</p>
<p>一九二七年之五月二十一日，林白大佐飛越大西洋之壯舉，竟告成功。當自紐約飛抵巴黎之翌日，全世界各地所發之賀電，紛至沓來，如此連續數天，總計收受之電報，在十萬通以上，電報局台全體人員，晝夜爲之工作，尙覺不及，可謂繁忙已極。至各通電報中，有自閔尼安普里司發來者，具名者竟達一萬七千人，該報所放紙條之長，竟達六</p>
<p>百英尺左右，此交際電之一事也。</p>
<p>本年一月三十日美總統羅斯福氏五十二歲誕辰，曾接賀電一通，計長一千二百九十呎重八鎊零二兩。電尾署名者共四萬一千人。此項賀電，係美國阿拉巴馬省盤明海城西方電報公司經收，用高速度自動電報機發往華盛頓，共計費時一千一百四十八分鐘。此又交際電之一事也。</p>
<p>在我國固尙未有如此偉大之成功家，且亦無如此巨數之交際電，於斯可見中西相差之程度尙遠，涉筆至此，不禁感喞系之。</p>
<h3>電報業務與公衆合作之關係</h3>

<p>電報事業，係社會公用企業之一種，其業務之良窳，影響於公衆關係者甚</p>
<p>大。故辦理電報業務者，應以公衆利益爲依歸，此電報商業代民衆化呼聲之所由起也。年來電政當局，致力於業務之改革，進展甚多。若郵電合設，有無綫電合併，委託旅行社代收電報及改訂報費等等，殆莫不以便利公衆爲前提。夫電報業務與公衆關係之密切旣如彼，其需要公衆之合作，當至爲殷切。蓋電報之使命，在於正確與迅速，苟非賴公衆之合作，殊難達到此目的，茲請試言其故。</p>
<p>自吾人之經騐言之：電報之錯誤，往往因發報人書寫潦草或翻譯舛誤。按電局對於電文字體之書寫，向極注意。凡華文或洋文去報紙上，均有「字體請勿潦草」之警語，以促發報人之注意。顧事守上仍有書寫潦草不能辨識者，雖</p>
<p>收報員有時可向發報人詢問繕正，但往往所費時間甚久，因此延誤其他報務，影響於電報業務者甚大。至因翻譯舛誤，發生無法投送或意義不明情事，此又爲發報人之損失，亦爲電局所不願。他若發報人因圖省費，致收報人地址不詳，無法投送，亦爲一般之通病，（按自二十三年一月一日起，凡收報人姓名住址不滿十五字者作五字計費新章實行後，此病免除不少）。故爲雙方利益着想，吾人要求發報人合作之條件，至爲簡單：卽「繕寫務須淸楚」，「翻譯務須審愼」及「收報人姓名住址務須詳盡」而已！</p>
<p>自收報人方面言之：吾人要求合作之條件有二：卽「請勿滯留報差」及「投送錯誤之電報，請逕送電局，切勿轉交他人」是也。查電報送達收報人時，必須在回單上加蓋圖章，交回報差。此項手續，至爲簡易，數秒鐘内卽可畢事，須收報人往往急欲拆閱電文，無暇顧及，致報差受無謂之稽留。吾人亟願收報人袪除此種習慣，以求電報投送之迅速。至收報人發現投送錯誤之電報，應請立卽送回電局，切勿逕轉他人，以免誤會。此爲電局應有之手續，亦願收報人予以合作者也。此外如各大商行在非辦公時間内接收電報，往往因無人收受，發生延誤情事，亦請與電局直接函商（參閱本刋半月消息）收報時間，加以規定，，以免發生上述情事，並盼各大商行予電局以種便利與合作。</p>
<p>以上所述，固屬俗通，無足深論，第以收發報人因習慣關係，未加注意，致彼此均受影響，吾人亟盼電局與公衆在切實全作下，互謀彼此便利，亦卽增加彼此利益也。</p>
<h3>郵轉電報與内地民衆</h3>
<p>— 開第</p>
<p>我國有四百三十一萬平方哩的領土，四億七千萬的人口，而全國電報局臺，僅僅祇有一千一百餘所，非但較之歐美各國，相差不可以道里計，卽與東隣</p>
<p>九三二年三月統計，電信局所，有七千七百十一局之多，返觀我浙皖贛三省的電報局，僅有一百五十一年，相形之下，令人生慚。</p>
<p>因我國電信事業尙未到普遍發達的程度，雖在通都大邑設有電報局的地方，民衆尙能享受電報通信的便利，但内地民衆，非祗未能享受，恐根本尙不知「電報」爲何物？交通部爲便利内地民衆通信及補助電局不足起見，本有一種「郵轉電報」的規定，惟創行以來報務頗覺淸淡，據民國二十二年一年的統計，全國郵轉電報，祗有三萬二千通左右，尙不及上海一個月的電報通數之多。考其原因，約有二點，第一，因内地民衆，風氣閉塞，民知未開，教育程度非常幼稚，對於「電報」，沒有深切的認識，「郵轉電報的名詞，旣根本未嘗了解，更何從加以利用？第二，因電報價目太高，拍發一張郵轉電報，除照章收費外，還要加收郵資二角五分或五角，計算起來，至少非要二三塊錢，不能拍發，超越了内地民衆的經濟力量。故欲謀郵轉電報發達，普遍地使内地民衆樂於利用，還有待於宣傳與改進丨</p>
<p>近來交通當局，爲要達到電報事業眞眞商業化與民衆化起見，對於内部的整頓丨人治法治丨電報的效能丨迅速準確丨民衆的便利丨簡便價廉丨等等，因在努力革新，向前邁進中；而對於内地民衆拍發電報的便利，也深切予以注意，如最近努力推行「郵電合設」，自本年三月十五日起，實行免收「郵轉電報」的郵資，都含有便利全國民衆的重大意義。郵電合設，正在試辦期中，暫置不論，現姑就「郵轉電報」的内容，約略說明一下。</p>
<p>郵轉電報的種類丨丨郵轉電報分甲乙丙三種。甲種郵轉電報，是指電報由未設電局而有郵局之子地，寄由電局或郵寄代辦所並設之丑地，轉往設有電局之寅地投送者而言。（見第一圖）</p>
<p>乙種郵轉電報，是指電報由已設電局之子地，寄由電局與郵局或郵局化辦</p>
<p>所並設之丑地，轉往未設電局而有郵局或郵寄代辦所之寅地投送者而言。（見第二圖）</p>
<p>丙種郵轉電報，是指電報由未設電局而有郵局之子地，寄由電局與郵局或</p>
<p>郵寄代辦所並設，而中間有電綫可通之丑地，遞往未設電局而有郵局或郵寄代辦所之卯地投送者而言。（見第三圖）</p>
<p>郵轉電報的價目丨丨郵轉電報，不論華洋明密，加急尋常，均可拍發，價目與國内電報，完全相同。卽華文明語，每字一角，華文密語與洋文，每字二角，急電加倍。在從前甲乙兩種郵轉電報，除照定章收費外，另須加收郵資二角五分，而丙種郵轉電報，因經郵局轉遞二次，尙應加收郵資五有。當局爲便利内地民衆通信起見，此項郵資，自本年三月十五日起，通令全國電局郵局，一律免收。且華文郵轉電報的收報人姓名，住址不滿十五字者，按五字計費，譯費亦一律免收，故郵轉電報傳遞手續雖略繁，而價目較諸普通電報，並不增</p>
<p>高。</p>
<p>郵轉電報的拍發手續丨凡未設電報局而有郵局（郵寄代辦所不在此例）地方的民衆，如有急事，均可在該地郵局，寄發國内設有電局或郵局及郵寄代辦所各地方之甲丙兩種郵轉電報。凡在設有電報局地方的民衆，如需要與未設電局而有郵局或郵寄代辦所地方的民衆通信，可向任何電報局，拍發乙種郵轉電報。拍發手續，非常簡單，發報人祇須將收報人姓名住址及電文，繕寫淸楚，交由電局或郵局，就可照章收費拍發。試舉例如下：</p>
<p>（例一）　如發報人在江蘇嘉定，家有病人危篤，催在天津的親眷速來看</p>
<p>視，可向嘉定郵局寄發甲種郵轉電如左：</p>
<p>天津法租界二十六號路卅號張翰卿，母病危速回伯。</p>
<p>此電共二十一字，照舊章須收報費郵資，洋共二元三角五分，但照現行新章，因收報人姓名住址在十五字以内均按五字計費，而郵費譯費一律免收，故祇須收洋一元一角。設此電在早八點由嘉定郵局寄發，該局收到後立刻快郵上海，在當日下午一二時，就可由上海局轉到天津收報人手中！</p>
<p>（例二）譬如發報人在上海，因學校考期迫促，工通知河北省稻地鎭的同學速來，可向上海局拍發乙種郵轉電報如左：</p>
<p>唐山稻地鎭東街源豐號唐子嘉篠（十七日）考速來蘭</p>
<p>此電共十八字，照舊章須收報費郵資洋共一元七角五分，而照現行新章，祇須收洋一元。如此電十二日晚十點鐘由上海局拍發，當晚到達唐山，唐局次早快郵寄出，十三日午定可到達稻地鎭，收報人接電於十四日趕搭滬平通車動身，决不有誤考期。</p>
<p>（例三）譬如發報人在嘉定，因送親戚赴上海搭滬平車赴天津，要通知稻地鎭收報人赴津接車，可在嘉定郵局拍發丙種郵轉電報如左：</p>
<p>唐山稻地鎭南街桃源坊（36)號李玉英母灰（十日）滬平車行赴津接惠</p>
<p>此電共二十五字，照舊章須收報費郵資洋共二元八角，而照現行新章，祇收洋一元五角。如此電於九日點在嘉定郵局寄發，當日中午定可由上海局轉到唐山，唐局立刻快郵寄出，當日四五點鐘可到稻地鎭，收報人接電後，於十日動身赴津接車，决不有誤。</p>
<p>由上述數例看來我們假使寄快信，至少須三五天可到達，那就什麽事多躭誤了，故郵轉電報的價廉效宏，確是便利内地民衆的一種通信利器，在現在電欵支絀，未能將電避普遍增設於全國以前，爲便利内地民衆通信及發展電報業務計，郵轉電報，確有努力提倡的必要也。</p>

<h3>一九三三年之英國電話</h3>
<p>— 敦</p>
<p>該國際股包含一五五接綫生位置，供無綫電通話者八十二（其中四位爲監察或尋查之用），供與大陸通話者一百二十三，比一百二十三位置中三十位，於繁忙時間完畢，及其他位置開始「直接業務」之際，卽行取消。其所使用之自働接轉機，亦新有改良。此外通話時，接綫生隨時可以觀察之「時計」，亦頗堪注意。每次電話接通時，該時計之針亦卽開始施轉，接綫生由此可以立刻觀察通話經過之時間，而又甚準確。一遇困難，接綫生立卽停止其前進，至通話恢復而止。故該時計所示之時間，卽爲計費之時間。</p>
<p>倫敦市際複用（Ｍulltiple）電話，事實上，可謂告竣，故從英京出發各話綫之上，現已均能直接通話。至於外省，或已新裝複用機，或將舊機改變，如Ｂirmingham　Bristol,Carotiff,Leeds,Leicester,Liverpool,Nottingham,Newcastle,SwanseaAberdeen,Edinbourg,Glasgow及Belfast亦已成立直接通話業務。（Ｍanchester城新裝複用機，亦　於本年二三月間完成開放，其他尙有不下一百小中心話局，本亦於春成立直接通話業務）。觀此，英國直接通話業務普及之速，誠屬驀人。然尙有足注意者，卽市際話綫并不因之而需添設。此項結果之獲得，乃由於取消過去種種非屬必要之工作，如掛號籤之辦理，用户之「重」呌等是也。直接通話，在營業方法上，實爲一種極大之進步，由通話次數之銳增，亦足證大受主顧之歡迎。</p>
<p>另一方面，關於遠距離之電話，亦努力改良，以期傳受淸晰響亮。惟過去及現在所從事者，尙限於上舉各重要中心之綫路。至於其他綫路欲予以改良，則需費甚鉅，亦非短促時間所能竣事。</p>
<p>五，國際綫路</p>
<p>爲發展國際業務起見，英國與法國，挪威，荷蘭，丹麥間，已敷設新綫。倫敦與波蘭京城間已成立直接綫路一條，以便利與波蘭，及俄國之通話。英國ＳaintˉMargaret’s　Bay與法國Ｃalais附近海岸一處，亦敷設一新話纜，以改進英國興法國，瑞士，意大利及西班牙間之交通。此條話纜之製造，異於平常使用，於需要時，可以利用爲「載波」通話。</p>
<p>此外，英國與印度間無綫電話亦已開放。</p>
<p>六，試騐與研究</p>
<p>英國郵電局，於數年前，卽有技術上試騐與研究之組織，惟地位極窄，工</p>
<p>作諸多不便，乃特在Ｄollis　Ｈill建築宏大完善之實騐室一所，於去年十月由英國内閣總理躬行成立典禮。</p>
<h3>新西蘭報價之整理</h3>
<p>電報計費新章，業經郵務總局宣布。從前國内各地往來之尋常電，每通十二字，計費一先令，加急電與星期日或假日所發之電，加倍計費。現在自四月三日起實行之新章，在本境内，則以十二字起碼，收費六便士。遞加一字，則加收費一便士，至一先令三便士爲最高額。轉遞地址不計。加急電照尋常電收費，僅</p>
<p>收附加費六先令，且無星期日價目之分。</p>
<h3>潛水艇内無綫電之新設備</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>馬凱公司近在潛水艇内，利用望遠天綫制度，安設一新式之無綫電求向設備。此項設備，並不與航舶航行相擾。當潛水艇浮於水面或沉於水底三十五呎深所得之正確性，與商用船舶上所得者相同。其收報機可安設在距離天綫二十呎之任何一點。至求向機在其汉帶三○○丨四○○公尺之内，可作普通收報用途云</p>

        <h1>1934.07.16</h1>
<h3>With Few of the Common People Remaining Alive: Yongding River's Water Level Reaches Level With Embankment, Springwater on Flat Ground Reaches Five Feet Deep; Severe Drought Conditions in Zhejiang, Henan, and Jiangxi; Deaths Due to Extreme Heat Occur One After Another; Yongding River Affairs Bureau Director Oversees Construction, Exerting Utmost Effort to Rescue and Protect</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level of the Yongding River once rose to thirteen Chinese feet last week. The upstream rainfall then ceased, and the level receded to its original position. However, a flash flood recently erupted in the mountains of Suiyuan and Chahar provinces and northern Shanxi. The water level at the Yongding River's Huilong Temple rapidly rose again by three feet. This morning at nine o'clock, it continued to rise to eighteen Chinese feet. The water surface of the southern second section is already level with the embankment, creating an extremely dangerous situation. In addition to telegraphing the provincial government for emergency assistance, the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, Men Zhenzhong, along with the inspection committee member Zhu Yukun and the head of the second section, Wu Shusheng, rushed to the southern second section this morning to oversee the defense, and conscripted laborers to exert utmost effort in rescue and protection. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Pingsui Railway's Water and Heat Continue to Rise, Tracks Cannot Be Repaired</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Director of the Pingsui Railway Bureau, Shen Chang, accompanied by the head of the engineering department, Jin Tao, went to Pingdiquan this afternoon to inspect the water situation and give instructions for repairs. They are expected to return to Beiping around the 17th. According to a public announcement from the Railway Bureau, the flooding is severe in the Pingdiquan and Zhuozishan areas of Suiyuan. The water is five feet deep in Pingdi, and mountain torrents are raging with great force. Multiple sections of the Pingsui Railway foundation have been breached. All the earthen buildings at Bikerqi Station have collapsed. A major flood occurred on this route in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1929], washing away dozens of miles and halting trains for thirty-four days. This year's flood is even greater than in the 18th year, making the situation particularly worrying. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to continuous heavy rains and flash floods in the Suiyuan region, the Pingsui Railway has had several sections of the line west of Pingdiquan submerged and washed away. The Pingdiquan station is also largely submerged. The roadbed at that location has been washed away, creating a pit of more than two zhang [~6.6 meters] in depth. Four or five sections of the tracks between Pingdiquan to the west and Zhuozishan have been damaged. Repairs are currently impossible due to the continued rise of the water. Passenger trains heading west on this route are still selling tickets as far as Pingdiquan. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Railway News: The water at Pingdiquan Station on the Pingsui Railway is two feet deep. All station platforms have been washed away. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Luan River Water Rises, Bridge in Danger</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Luan River's water continues to rise rapidly. The Luan River Bridge is in a precarious state. In addition to dispatching workers to defend it, the Beining Railway Bureau dispatched an engineering train to be stationed there on the afternoon of the 14th as a precaution. All passenger and freight trains passing over the bridge are also reducing their speed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

The Western medical community has been ordered to mobilize and provide treatment. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The climate in Xuhai is extremely hot, breaking the highest recorded temperature in thirty years. In one corner of Xuzhou city, dozens of men and women are dying from the heat every day. Coffin shops cannot meet the demand. The Public Security Bureau has lifted the ban for one month, due to the high heat, on employees going shirtless and sleeping in the streets. The New Life Movement Promotion Association has also ordered the military and police inspection teams to temporarily suspend the crackdown on citizens' dress code. The autumn crops in the surrounding countryside have been withered by the scorching sun for days, and farmers are again hoping for rain. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Thirty People Die from Heat in One Day in Jinan</h3>
<p>(Jinan) It is still extremely hot today. There is no breeze or clouds. Pedestrians are suddenly scarce. There have been many deaths from the heat. This morning, Han telegraphed the chief secretary, Zhang Shaotang, ordering him to purchase a large quantity of summer medicines to distribute to the police officers on duty throughout the city to provide immediate treatment. The Public Security Bureau has counted thirty deaths due to heat today.

<p>(Hangzhou) The person in charge of the Provincial Drought Relief Office told a Central News Agency reporter that the current drought situation in Zhejiang Province is most severe in the five prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Jinhua, and Shaoxing. In Quzhou and Yan Prefecture, two or three counties, including Jiangshan and Shouchang, have received rain and are expected to have some relief. Few disaster reports have been received from Chu and Ning prefectures. The rainfall in Wen and Tai prefectures is still adequate, and a good harvest is hoped for. The provincial government is making every effort to rescue the situation with manpower and stabilize public morale. The provincial government has also scheduled a meeting for the afternoon of the 16th at 3:00 PM, inviting the magistrates of Hangzhou County, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Chongde, Haining, Deqing, Yuyao, Shangyu, and Cixi counties to the province to discuss the allocation of water from the Qiantang River into the canal and the inland river for the rice paddies of each county.

<p>(Beiping) The rumors of Huang Fu's passivity are not true.

Regarding the latter, he is currently working closely with the central government on planning, and it is expected that a decision will be made in the near future. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Face of the Eastern European Pact Plan Has Completely Changed; De Facto Recognition of Germany's Equal Status; France's Security-Oriented Diplomacy Achieves Victory</h3>
<p>Milan: The Italian acceptance of the revised Eastern Locarno Pact, the general situation has been seen in the government's announcement yesterday. Today, the Italian Prime Minister's organ, the Italian People's Daily, has a more detailed report. The newspaper's editorial today stated that the original plan of the Eastern Locarno Pact was based on anti-German objectives. However, when French Foreign Minister Barthou visited London, the original intention of the pact underwent a dramatic change. Therefore, today's new treaty has become a completely new document. The new treaty not only includes the provision that the Soviet Union should provide guarantees and assistance to France if it is attacked by Germany, and vice versa if the Soviet Union is attacked by Germany, France should do the same, but also, conversely, if Germany is attacked by the Soviet Union or France, France and the Soviet Union will provide Germany with the same guarantees and assistance. Moreover, the new agreement also has an extremely important point, that is, Germany's long-demanded right to equal armament is now de facto recognized. Therefore, the reason for Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has now been eliminated. The newspaper concluded, "Our position is exactly the same as that of the United Kingdom, that is, we do not bear any additional responsibility beyond the original Locarno Pact." (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome: The authoritative "Italian Daily" stated that "France has always said that security comes first, and disarmament comes second. The common declaration of December 5, 1932, recognized the principle of Germany's equality in armament, with security as its basis. Now, the Eastern Locarno Treaty is combined with the original Locarno Treaty, so the conditions for security that France has hoped for day and night can be fundamentally realized from this." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A portion of public opinion here has expressed dissatisfaction with British Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration in the House of Commons on Friday. They are quite unhappy about Germany's acquisition of equal rights and interests in the Eastern Locarno Pact. For example, the Paris Daily stated that the Eastern Locarno Pact was originally a guarantee against Germany, but now it gives Germany the benefit of equal armament. After hearing Simon's declaration, we feel like we have had a nightmare. The newspaper further compared the Eastern Locarno Pact to a commercial promissory note, but the credit deposits of Germany and the Soviet Union in the bank have no guarantees. However, the majority of French public opinion still believes that Simon's speech represents a victory for French policy, and it should be considered particularly fortunate that the cooperation between France and the Soviet Union can obtain the formal approval of the United Kingdom.

<h3>The German Coup Remains an Unsolved Mystery; Hitler Dared Not Mention the Murder of a Woman; The Declaration to the Parliament Ultimately Failed to Dispel All Doubts</h3>
<p>(London) The Star published an editorial criticizing Hitler's declaration to the German Parliament, stating that Hitler neither explained the detailed process of the June 30 incident nor explained the reasons why such actions were necessary. It said, "Fifteen days after Hitler's killings, we still do not understand the reasons, and the names of those who died are still unknown. After Hitler's killings, there were many rumors about the so-called conspiracy case. What is the inside story? Over time, it will gradually be exposed, but no evidence of the conspiracy has been presented to date. Some say that the brewing situation was extremely complicated, and that there were terrorist elements who joined the army and were not sworn in, and that their behavior was feared to be improper, so they had to be eliminated. If this were the case, why did Hitler and his party not do it earlier, and wait until it was beyond repair before resolving it by slaughter? Therefore, we also suspect that the reason why the deceased did not protect their leaders may have been due to their bad character. However, everyone in the world knows that these people's daily behavior is filthy. How could Hitler take such drastic measures because of this? Hitler's declaration said that he takes responsibility for his actions, but there is one thing he never apologized for, and that is the murder of former Chancellor Schleicher's wife. Hitler has always boasted of being brave. Now he killed a woman, but dared not mention it. Is this what he calls being brave?" (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The "Berner Tagblatt," published in the Swiss capital, commented on German Chancellor Hitler's declaration yesterday, stating that "Although the German side has successively announced the number of victims in the June 30 incident, it is neither detailed nor consistent, and the press has already pointed this out. Hitler felt it was necessary to provide supplementary explanations yesterday, so he re-announced the number of deaths. But Hitler's killings this time were without trial, and those who truly knew the important inside information were mostly eliminated. Therefore, although Hitler has provided supplementary explanations, we still believe that the inside story has not been revealed. What is particularly strange and incomprehensible is the position of Papen. Papen cannot fully agree with this incident, but he cannot leave. His current situation is difficult to fathom." The Basler National-Zeitung stated that "The principle held by the National Socialist Party is that if the June 30 incident was not carried out with ruthless means, the power of the National Socialist Party would be swept away from here. Hitler and his National Socialism have experienced many difficulties in domestic politics, but since yesterday's discussion of foreign affairs in the British House of Commons, the international situation, for Germany and for the whole of Europe, has changed. In the future, the difficulties that the German government will face in foreign affairs will be even greater than in domestic politics." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Independent Faction Dominates Philippine Constitutional Convention Elections</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Japanese Consul General stationed in Manila, the elections for representatives to the Philippine Constitutional Convention were held on the 10th of this month. As of the 13th, it has been found that there are a total of 188 representatives, of which the independent faction, i.e., the Quezon faction, accounts for 68 representatives, the opposition faction, i.e., the Osmeña faction, accounts for 28 representatives, and the neutral faction or those who are unaffiliated account for 11 representatives. This is the result of the election. These representatives will review the issue of Philippine independence. In other words, it is very clear that the Quezon faction, i.e., the independent faction, is generally dominant in the Constitutional Convention. (Japanese United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Germany Informs the US Government of Willingness to Open Debt Negotiations; Declares No Intention to Discriminate Against the US; Franco-German Negotiations Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German News Agency issued a communiqué stating that since Germany received the US government's note on the foreign debt issue on June 27 of this year (note: the US note to Germany on this day was worded sternly, rejecting Germany's reasons for explanation, and still hoping that Germany would strive to fulfill its debts), the German authorities have explained to US Ambassador to Berlin, Mr. Dodd, that the German government has no intention of discriminating against the United States on the debt issue. Considering Germany's currency situation and its trade surplus situation, it is indeed impossible to repay the debt. However, since Germany has already been negotiating with various countries to resolve this matter, why would it not do the same for the United States? It is hoped that the United States can consult with Germany so that Germany can repay the principal and interest of the Dawes and Young loans. Note that the interest on the two loans is due on October 15 and December 1, respectively, leaving ample time for contact. In addition, Germany has no intention of discriminating against US creditors with respect to other debts. On May 29 of this year, Germany issued a notice proposing to issue 3% consolidation bonds. If the United States can accept this proposal, Germany is also willing to issue a similar declaration to the United States in accordance with the contents of the German-British Declaration of July 4 (note: on July 4, the British and German governments signed an agreement to resolve the debt issue, containing three points. Its preamble stated that the two governments wanted to enable commercial and financial relations between the two countries to develop on the basis of non-discriminatory treatment, etc., with a validity period of six months. The British government agreed not to adopt the practice of offsetting debts against German goods during the validity period). (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(New York) The famous international banker, Morgan &amp; Co., telegraphed the German Minister of Finance today, strongly protesting the German government's failure to fulfill its obligations to US investors holding Dawes and Young bonds. The telegram stated that the Dawes and Young loans were the highest form of obligation granted under the power of the German government. Meanwhile, according to news from Paris, the Franco-German commercial negotiations held in Berlin, officials said, have reached agreement in principle. It is reported that major issues such as the Dawes and Young loans, etc.,</p>
<p>can thus be resolved to mutual satisfaction. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Naval Expansion is Alarming</h3>
<p>The establishment of Japan's new Okada Cabinet can be described as an extension of the Saito Cabinet in terms of its general nature. It is a manifestation of the country's desire to maintain the status quo. However, a closer examination of its inherent nature reveals that the leadership of politics by naval officers is ultimately aimed at using naval power to control the Pacific and manipulate the Far Eastern situation. As Japanese-American diplomacy gradually becomes rigid, it is not easy for the United States to seek genuine peaceful measures in the Far East. The only effective method lies in the joint action of Britain and the United States to maintain security in the Pacific. However, Britain's viewpoint differs. Its intention seems to be that Anglo-Japanese understanding is more important than Anglo-American cooperation. Thus, Japan takes the opportunity to display its skillful diplomacy, starting with the exchange of documents between Hirota and Hull, followed by the external statement of April 17, and then sending Konoe Fumimaro to the United States, hoping to obtain understanding between the two countries. However, given the cunning of the Japanese, they are certainly aware of the complexity of international relations in the Pacific. The so-called diplomatic skills are merely to cope with the current situation and provide temporary relief. If Britain and the United States can truly act in unison, Japan will inevitably be in a passive position at the future naval disarmament conference. In that case, not only would the domination of the Pacific be close to a dream, but the balance of power in the Far East would also have to be re-established.</p>
<p>The year 1936 will soon arrive, and Japan's advance notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations will take effect. However, what will follow is the issue of the trusteeship of the former German Caroline, Mariana, and Marshall Islands. All of these islands are related to Japan's national defense. The country's naval militarists will undoubtedly make every effort to cope with this issue. This is one matter. The Japanese have been using diplomacy to alienate Britain and the United States, and this is gradually showing results. Therefore, they are taking a further step to (A) overturn the naval ratios set by the Washington and London Naval Conferences and advocate absolute equality of naval power among Britain, the United States, and Japan. (B) Express Japan's determination and efforts by proposing a naval budget for the fiscal year 1935-1936 containing 750 million Japanese yen. (C) Use Japan's far inferior air force as an excuse to not only increase eight air squadrons in the second naval replenishment plan but also add more air squadrons and renew all old aircraft, expanding their range to 12,000 kilometers. This is another matter.</p>
<p>Among today's naval powers, Britain, with its colonies all over the world, finds it extremely difficult to concentrate its entire fleet to attack others in the event of any incident. The United States, located between two major oceans, has sufficient forces to guard the Panama Canal and maintain the Monroe Doctrine toward Central and South America. However, it is not easy to cross the Pacific to protect the Philippines and prevent Japan from infringing on its Far Eastern navigation rights. Only Japan has a small land area, and its coastal harbors are all naturally dangerous and well-defended. With a little equipment, they can be as solid as gold. Therefore, at the Washington Conference, the Japanese government only needed the United States to recognize that it would not build fortresses in the Philippines and Guam, and Britain would not increase its forces in Hong Kong, and it readily agreed to the 5:5:3 ratio. This was not Japan deliberately showing weakness, but because it clearly knew that the defenses of the Philippines and Hong Kong were lax. If they were not urgently strengthened, it could concentrate its forces at any time and place and attack them. Therefore, it did not go too far. In the past, what the Japanese feared most was the joint blockade by Britain and the United States, which would prevent its limited military power from being deployed to its advantage. However, the situation has changed drastically, and a blockade of Japan is almost impossible. On the one hand, Japan's coastline is too long, and the existing fleets of Britain and the United States do not have such capabilities. On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to cut off transportation in the Sea of Japan. Japan has sufficient military power to maintain such sea lanes. Japan can retreat to defend and advance to attack. Therefore, it dares to be confident. Those who say that the establishment of the new Okada Cabinet</p>
<p>makes the future of naval disarmament even gloomier, is this not without reason?</p>
<p>Conflicting Opinions Among Britain, the United States, and Japan</p>
<h3>Naval Negotiations Recess, to Reconvene in October; US Representative Davis Will Return Home Briefly; Japan Expresses Unwillingness to Consider Technical Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It was learned today from well-informed sources that Britain, the United States, and Japan have agreed to postpone the current preliminary naval talks being held in London until October. It is reported that one Japanese naval commissioner will arrive in London at that time. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The preparatory naval conference convened in London began consultations among Britain, the United States, and Japan on June 19. Subsequently, several separate negotiations were held between the US and Japan, the UK and Japan, and the UK and France. The procedural issues such as the location and date of the conference were also discussed and finalized by the UK, US, France and Japan. Furthermore, Britain and the United States have gone a step further and convened expert meetings on specific issues, but opinions have not converged, and the positions of both sides are quite disparate. Moreover, since Colonel Iwashita, the Japanese government's representative to London, has not yet arrived at his destination and is not prepared to discuss technical issues, the expert meetings between Britain and the United States have also made no significant progress. US Representative Davis will soon return home, and it would be of little benefit to continue the preparatory negotiations. This view is quite strong among the governments of Britain, the United States, and Japan. Therefore, the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan currently in London have agreed to postpone the preparatory conference until October and temporarily adjourn it, and have scheduled the three countries to issue a joint statement on the above situation on the 18th of this month. Foreign Minister Hirota has issued instructions to Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira, expressing his approval. (Japan United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>US's Large Shipbuilding Plan to Begin Implementation in Mid-Next Month</h3>
<p>The Washington government announced today a large-scale naval construction plan, which will begin on August 15. If it continues, the US Navy will reach the full limit allowed by the naval treaty by 1939. On August 15, the Naval Department will formally open bids for the construction of two heavy destroyers, twelve light destroyers, six submarines, one light cruiser, and three light cruisers, totaling twenty-four vessels. This construction plan was proposed by Mr. Vinson in the previous Congress and passed by Congress. Whether or not to build all of them will depend on the results of next year's naval conference. If the US naval strength is at full capacity or is proceeding with construction, it will be more convenient during negotiations. (National News dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan Opens a Five-Minister Conference to Adjust National Defense Diplomacy; Aims to Address Next Year's Naval Conference; Disagreement Between Army and Navy; National Defense Strategy Centers on Manchuria; Military and Diplomacy Proceed in Tandem</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The New Five-Minister Conference was originally established for next year's naval conference. However, because the Saito Cabinet last autumn decided on fundamental guidelines for national defense, diplomacy, and finance, it was felt necessary to reconfirm them. Therefore, it was convened continuously. It is reported that the Navy's proposal for arms reduction differed greatly from the intentions of the Army and Foreign Ministry, and it was necessary to resolve this politically. Therefore, Navy Minister Osumi requested the convening of the conference. The Japanese Navy strongly advocates that the established guidelines, i.e., moving from the principle of ratios to open covenants and establishing equal rights to armaments, are the important hope of the entire Navy. If the powers do not listen to the Japanese Navy's fair demands, then it will be unavoidable and it will not hesitate to abolish the 5:5:3 ratio Washington Treaty. The attitude is extremely tough and it seeks to resolve the issue with this determination that it will not yield. Therefore, the general public is paying close attention to how this case will develop in the future. (Japan United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army, for its part, is targeting the severe international situation in 1935-1936 and is carrying out various preparations. The main tasks are recorded below: (1) Regarding the implementation of national defense policy, it has submitted four major proposals to Prime Minister Okada regarding international relations, domestic countermeasures, the Manchurian problem, and the expansion of armaments, and demanded their implementation. (2) The budget for the next fiscal year is compiled with the severe international situation as the goal. Research is also underway on the requirements plan for materials procurement expenses, Manchurian incident expenses, air force expansion expenses, and education supplement expenses. It has been decided that 110 million yen of the materials procurement expenses will be approved by the Ministry of Finance at the same time as this year's budget. Since the Manchurian incident expenses have ended this year, it is impossible to reduce the 145 million yen of this year due to the permanent stationing of troops. The expansion expenses of the air force and the education supplement expenses have indeed required considerable amounts. It is said that the total amount requested will exceed 600 million yen. (3) Personnel reshuffle: Army Minister Hayashi has scheduled the announcement of regular transfers on August 1. In order to complete military training, the selection of military officers and team leaders is under consideration. (Japan United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, at the earnest request of Prime Minister Okada, has decided to follow the foreign policy and national defense guidelines decided by the previous cabinet in the Five-Minister Conference in order to promote the spirit of cooperative diplomacy. The fundamental guidelines for its implementation of foreign policy are roughly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Japan is mindful of the only stable force for peace in East Asia, and</p>
<p>in international relations, it should prioritize peace and strive to carry out Japan's主張through diplomatic means. (2) Regarding the disarmament conference, it should be handled with a fair attitude and strive to carry out its主張. If the other country takes unreasonable actions, it will not hesitate to withdraw from the conference. (3) In order to establish good neighborly relations with the Soviet Union and China, it should first strive to resolve outstanding issues. (4) In order to protect overseas commercial rights, it is necessary to seek necessary measures to facilitate the outward development of Japanese products. (5) In order to implement the above appropriate measures, it is necessary to add overseas embassies or consulates and to assign commercial officers in order to expand. (6) Strive to establish political, economic, and all other policies toward Manchuria. Therefore, Japan should devote all its efforts to the co-existence and co-prosperity of Japan and "Manchuria." (7) Refresh personnel. (Japan United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Joins the League of Nations; Receives Unanimous Support from Britain and France; Will Formally Submit a Request for Assistance</h3>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations officials announced today that Soviet Russia will formally request to join the League of Nations within two weeks. Now that Britain and France have unanimously supported it, there is no need to worry about passing a two-thirds majority. Therefore, when the League of Nations convenes in September, Soviet Russia can be elected as a formal member. For months, Soviet leaders have been debating fiercely about joining the League of Nations. However, recently, Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov participated in the European Disarmament Conference and was sponsored by France, which led to the decision to join. The diplomatic circles of France and Italy have been making every effort to remove obstacles. Recently, British Foreign Minister Simon also announced his support. According to the most informed sources in the League of Nations, Soviet Russia's joining the International Union is to obtain the greatest assistance from League of Nations members in the event of disputes with Japan in the Far East and with Germany in Europe. (National News dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Foreign Affairs Committee today did not</p>
<p>agree to express its opinion on the claim in Geneva that Soviet Russia will formally request to join the League of Nations within two weeks. According to the most reliable sources here, Soviet Russia will probably request to join, but not necessarily within two weeks. (National News dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Amidst World Drought, Storms Rage in Western Europe</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia is also ravaged by drought this year, resulting in reduced agricultural harvests. The price of food has risen accordingly. Officials have now also admitted that the agricultural harvest in southern Soviet Union has suffered "partial destruction." They have also issued an order stating that the reduction in agricultural production has forced the government to moderately increase the prices of bread and flour, and wages should also be increased accordingly to offset this, especially for the low-wage labor class. It is heard that this wage increase is uneven, ranging from 9% to over 16%. However, general public opinion believes that the disaster in Soviet Russia is very serious. Although the government suffers financial losses, it is still feared that it will not be able to universally alleviate the suffering of the people. (National News dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) There have been reports of storms raging around the world. In Italy and France, many people have died and suffered immeasurable losses in recent days due to storms.

<h3>San Francisco Begins General Strike Today; 150,000 Workers Participate in Supporting Longshoremen; 4,000 National Guardsmen Ordered to Deploy to Prevent Riots; Residents Rush to Store Food, Commerce Completely Paralyzed</h3>
<p>San Francisco San Francisco is on the verge of a food shortage and now faces the danger of a general strike. The special labor committee established by various labor unions yesterday held a meeting this morning for a long time and decided to start a general strike starting Monday. It is expected that in addition to the 100,000 workers directly affected, 50,000 more will also stop working to express solidarity with the longshoremen. After the resolution of the special labor committee was announced, the local police chief immediately declared a state of emergency to cope with the expected disturbances. 4,000 National Guardsmen have been ordered to prepare to enter the city at any time to assist the 2,000 already stationed in the city. Hopes for mediation have now been completely dashed. When the special labor committee voted on the general strike this morning, only three of the 63 union delegations voted against it. The supply of food and fuel is decreasing daily, and land and water transportation remains blocked. Residents of the city are all concerned about food shortages and violence. All those who are able are fleeing to other places for safety. All kinds of commerce have almost completely stopped. There have been disturbances in many places in the city today, as residents rush to sugar and flour stores to buy as much of these two items as possible to prevent the strike from prolonging. In the rush, order was disrupted. It is reported that the mayor has issued a notice saying that essential matters of life will be maintained at all costs, which is a comfort to the residents. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The San Francisco general strike was decided to start on Monday, so public bus ticket sellers stopped working thirty-six hours before the deadline stipulated in the strike order. Streetcar ticket sellers followed suit. Many grocery stores, butcher shops, and restaurants are closed. Some stores limit the amount sold. No more than five pounds of sugar, rice, or flour can be purchased per person, and no more than six pounds of potatoes per person. Restaurants and hotel dining rooms only serve regular customers and are closed to everyone else. In addition to the main entrance, the doors of various hotel dining rooms are guarded by the police. Currently, most San Francisco residents are taking advantage of the weekend to drive to the countryside to buy daily necessities. However, the strike pickets are heavily guarded on the thoroughfares. It is unknown whether these people will continue to allow passage. These pickets have detained commercial trucks, resulting in more than a dozen being burned or pushed off the road.

<h3>President to Land in San Francisco, Will Intervene in the Dispute</h3>
<p>San Diego It is believed here that President Roosevelt may personally intervene in the general strike movement that is brewing in San Francisco at an extremely fast pace. Local Postmaster Stewart told reporters that the President may land in San Francisco on his way to Honolulu. Mr. Stewart has been ordered to forward the President's mail to San Francisco. Mr. Stewart said that the order issued by Washington had no explanation and no indication that the President would change his itinerary in order to personally mediate the labor-management dispute in San Francisco.

<h3>Conservatives Gain Power in the Union, General Strike May Be Avoided</h3>
<p>The San Francisco Labor Council Strike Committee today recommended that all unions that support the general strike go on strike at 10:00 a.m. on Monday. The committee is composed of 117 union representatives from across the city and also recommended that other unions that have not yet supported the general strike immediately vote on whether to participate. There was a great deal of debate at the meeting of the committee. As a result, the conservatives won, so the proposal to implement the general strike on Monday did not pass, but only suggested that those who supported it participate. The danger of a general strike has not been eliminated, but the rise of the conservatives is quite noteworthy. At the same time, other unions are voting on whether to participate. The Market Street Railway Company, the largest streetcar company in San Francisco, will probably shut down completely because the streetcar union announced that 4,800 of the company's employees will join the strike starting at 2:00 a.m. on Sunday. The company claims that only a small number of workers will participate, but the streetcars will be completely shut down to avoid danger. The conservatives in the Labor Council have now occupied all key positions in the strike conference. There were 900 people participating in the conference. When they took office, they gave a speech saying that implementing a general strike at this time would be unfavorable to the labor side, so there is hope that the general strike can be avoided. The result of the meeting was a compromise: all unions that agree to participate will go on strike on Monday morning, and those who do not agree will continue to work. However, all unions must decide immediately. (National News dispatch, 14th)</p>

Currently, the situation in western Fujian is tense, while the situation in Junmen is relatively calm. It is for this reason. It is reported here that the bandit suppression military affairs in western Fujian are extremely active. The central air force is flying over Changting, Gucheng, and Shicheng. As for southern Jiangxi, Huichang and Yudu, the Communist bandits have no dangerous places to defend and have retreated to Shangbang, Tilongling, and other places in the east of the city. It is expected that after the main force of the Red bandits in Changting collapses, Huichang and Ruijin can be easily obtained.</p>

<h3>Japan Has No Intention of Abolishing the Tanggu Truce Agreement ▲Setting Up Customs Posts at Various Great Wall Ports Will Start from Gubeikou ▲After Paying Respects to Huang Fu, Yin Tong Will Go to Changchun to Exchange Views</h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence, the various issues in the war zone were preliminarily negotiated by Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others with Shibayama, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy. Then Yin Tong asked Huang Fu for instructions and prepared to go to Changchun for contact. The situations of all parties are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Shibayama Will Go to Changchun</h3>
<p>Shibayama, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, said today (14th) regarding the war zone issue: "I am scheduled to leave Peiping for Changchun within four days to discuss solutions with the Kwantung Army. After returning to Peiping, I will gradually negotiate with the person in charge of the war zone. At that time, the exchange of security teams, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from various Great Wall ports, and the reception of the Eastern Tombs will not be a problem. As for the abolition of the Tanggu Truce Agreement and the postal communication issue, I have not heard of any contact."</p>
<h3>Customs Posts at Various Ports</h3>
<p>Huo Shi, director of the Gubeikou Office of the Jiji Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office, said today (14th) that Zhang Yongnian, Deputy Director of the Tariff Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Gao Yuanji, Inspector of the Yantai-East China Sea Customs, are scheduled to go to Gubeikou within days to inspect the site of the customs post. I originally planned to return to Gubeikou today, but postponed it due to rain, and will definitely leave the day after tomorrow. Also, Gao Yuanji and Zhang Yongnian visited Yin Rugeng at 11:00 AM today to discuss the establishment of customs posts at various Great Wall ports. It was decided to start with Gubeikou first, and then set up posts one by one. The Gubeikou tax card address will be allocated by the Jiji Special Office. Zhang Yongnian also said that due to matters in Peiping, there will be a delay of four or five days, and Director Huo will return to Miyun first and wait to go to Gubeikou together.</p>
<h3>War Zone Negotiation Issues</h3>
<p>As a result of informal negotiations between China and Japan on various issues in the war zone, the Kwantung Army will be in charge of all negotiations in the war zone, such as the exchange of security teams and the withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops from various Great Wall ports. Currently, it is inconvenient to communicate back and forth by telegram. Therefore, Shibayama is going to Changchun. At the same time, Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, is going to Hangzhou to ask Huang Fu for instructions on the negotiation policy. After Yin waits for instructions, he will go directly to Changchun to make preliminary contact with Hishikari Takashi, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, together with Shibayama. After Huang Fu returns north, a concrete solution will be made.</p>
<h3>Japanese Claim They Won't Withdraw from Eastern Tombs</h3>
<p>The administrative part of Malanyu has already been taken over by us. The unresolved issues are: (1) The takeover of the Eastern Tombs; (2) The withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops. As a result of negotiations between Yin Rugeng and the Japanese, the general decisions are as follows: (1) The Eastern Tombs will be taken over by us, and an organization will be established to protect them with full responsibility. (2) Puppet troops are allowed to exit the pass, but Japanese troops will not withdraw for the time being. (14th)</p>
<h3>Drought and Flooding at the Same Time, Disasters Are Particularly Severe in Hubei Province ▲Central Government Orders Provincial Government to Investigate and Plan Relief Efforts ▲Provincial Party Headquarters Asks for Punishment of Personnel Who Neglected Dike Construction ▲Wuhan Heat Reaches 110 Degrees on Thermometer</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, since this month, the entire Hubei Province has suffered from water in the northwest, drought in the southeast and central regions, and the heat in Wuhan. At this time of rural bankruptcy and urban decline, strange disasters are attacking us, getting worse and worse, which is truly a serious social problem. Although the water situation in the Xiang River has subsided, the dikes in Jiangling, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Mianyang, Hanchuan, Hanyang, and the Yangtze River basin in Shishou and Jianli have collapsed, causing a major disaster. In Yunxian, mountain torrents broke out, and the water rose more than three zhang (about 33 feet) on the flat ground. The Yunbai highway, which had just been built and opened to traffic, was destroyed by the water, and more than 130 laborers were swept away by the flood. Other losses are even more difficult to count. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau believes that although the Xiang River has receded slightly and the situation has gradually eased, dike repair work must still be actively carried out. It specially ordered Zhang Xishou, director of the Fourth Engineering Office in Shishou, Li Zhiwu, director of the Fifth Engineering Office in Hanchuan, Chen Shaofen, director of the Sixth Engineering Office in Yuekou, and Chen Zhangguan, director of the Seventh Engineering Office in Ruyang, to work with engineers sent by the bureau to quickly repair the collapsed parts of the dikes and complete them within a time limit. Bureau Chief Yang Silian personally went to each dike to supervise the work to prevent further flooding. At the same time, the Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters strictly ordered the Provincial Government to instruct the administrative inspectors and county magistrates to assist effectively, without any hesitation or evasion, to fulfill their duties.</p>
<p>The drought situation in various places is also extremely serious. For example, in Huangmei, Guangji, Qichun, Xishui, Luotian, and Huanggang in eastern Hubei, Puqi, Xianning, Chongyang, Tongshan, Yangxin, and Daye in southern Hubei, and Jingzhong in central Hubei, there has been no rain for a long time, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The government, in response to the people's request, ordered a ban on slaughter, but there was still no rain, and the land will be barren. The Department of Civil Affairs has already drafted four drought prevention and famine preparedness measures as follows: (1) Instructing all counties to urge farmers in drought-stricken areas to speed up drought prevention work such as well digging, ditch dredging, and water pumping, and to purchase grain seeds to continue planting. If funds are difficult to raise, they are allowed to borrow from provincial funds or local public funds to meet emergency needs. (2) Implementing the regional field system to provide relief for delayed grain planting. (3) Prohibiting the use of grain or miscellaneous grains for making sugar and brewing wine to maintain food supplies. (4) Strictly assessing the performance of county magistrates in drought prevention and famine preparedness, and rewarding or punishing them accordingly.</p>
<p>In Wuhan, due to the severe drought, the heat is terrible. The thermometer reads 102 to 104 degrees indoors and often above 110 degrees outdoors. Millions of citizens are suffering as if they are being roasted, and the pain is indescribable. Recently, epidemics have been rampant, and deaths have followed one another. If it does not rain in a few more days, the situation will be even more unimaginable. The Provincial Government believes that the disasters in Hubei are severe and has already telegraphed the Central Government. The Central Government replied by telegram, ordering the Provincial Government to investigate the disaster situation first in order to plan relief efforts in a coordinated manner. In addition, the Provincial Party Headquarters resolved two important cases: (1) The Xiang River flooded, and the official dikes in Hanchuan and Mianyang counties were washed away, causing a terrible inundation. Although the flood was a natural disaster, it was also caused by poor planning. It was found that the areas in Han and Mian had been in bandit areas for a long time, and the wounds had not yet healed, and they had suffered a major flood, and the surviving people were displaced and suffering. The Provincial Party Headquarters decided to send a letter to the Provincial Government to provide immediate relief to help them, and to issue a notice to all county magistrates, emphasizing flood prevention work, and to send a letter to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, severely punishing those who were ineffective, as a warning to those who neglected their duties. (2) Since the beginning of this month, the weather in this province has been arid, and the water level of the rivers has risen sharply. Tianmen, Qianjiang, and Mianyang have been flooded, and most of the remaining counties have withered crops. Drought and flooding have occurred simultaneously, and disaster is imminent. The Provincial Party Headquarters decided to send a letter to the Provincial Government to concentrate financial resources and provide as much relief as possible, and all non-urgent matters should be temporarily suspended to alleviate the people's suffering.

At the same time, security team patrol cars and police cars from the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau also provided security in the front and rear until they arrived at the execution ground. The Navy Command's supervising officer and Public Security Bureau Section Chief Shen and Medical Officer Deng arrived by car to direct everything. After Liu's execution, the police station immediately took the coffin and carried it to the new public cemetery for burial. The criminal was 47 years old, from Yexian. He served as a brigade commander under Zhang Zongchang when he governed Shandong. He showed no change in expression at the time of execution, and said, "I followed Zhang Zongchang for more than ten years, and I didn't die in the Southern and Northern Wars. I didn't expect to die today. After I die, I will go find Zhang Zongchang."</p>
<p>The Navy Command issued a proclamation regarding the execution of the criminal Liu, stating: "For the matter of proclamation, the Qingdao Public Security Bureau sent Liu Senlin and Sun Zuochen to be tried together.

<h3>Wuxi, Chengjiang, and Wu Three Counties Consult on Key Strategies for Drought Relief; Dredge the Lü River, County Magistrate Yan Goes to the Countryside to Supervise Construction; Various Groups Send Telegrams to the Provincial Department Requesting to Dredge the Huangtian Port</h3>
<p>Wuxi News: The Jiangnan region is suffering from severe drought, and people are vying to provide disaster relief. The Provincial Department has decided to first connect the rivers and lakes to draw water. In order to seek cooperation and find ways to remedy the situation, Wuxi, Chengjiang, and Wu counties decided to raise the sluice gate of Huangtian Port in Jiangyin, install a 12-inch motor, and set up a water bellows to bail water day and night. The estimated cost is 10,000 yuan, which will be shared equally by the two counties of Wuxi and Chengjiang. Wu Shuying, chairman of the Chengjiang Chamber of Commerce, and Gong Sunyi, Zhang Yingen and other three gentlemen were sent to Wuxi to meet with Yang Hanxi, chairman of the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, and Qian Sunqing, Cai JianSan, Chen Zhanru, etc., to seek opinions. At the same time, Lin Junbao, chairman of the Wujin Chamber of Commerce, was also invited to Wuxi to discuss drought relief measures. As a result, the fundamental solution to this case is to dredge Huangtian Port. The representatives of the three counties unanimously advocated jointly sending a telegram to the Provincial Department, requesting that personnel be dispatched for investigation and immediate start of dredging. On the county government side, because the northeastern part of the county has the highest terrain, the river water is the shallowest, and the disaster is the most serious, the Construction Bureau has investigated and planned to allocate the shallow river channel, build dams at the river mouth for pumping, such as Sanba Bridge in the sixth district, Dacheng Bridge in the seventh district, Sun Dian Bridge in the second district, and Laoya Bridge in the fifth district. Currently, water bailer machines are being collected. As for the small branch rivers and streams in the four townships, each district head has been strictly ordered to supervise the peasants to dredge as much as possible. Those who are unable to plant rice in the mountainous fields should all change to planting buckwheat and green beans. The necessary seeds have also been purchased to alleviate the emergency in some areas. In addition, the Public Grain Association Chairman Zhao Zixin and others said that the river channel from Beiting Lijiang Jianqi to Yokohama has been silted and is difficult for boats to navigate. They are now planning to find a way to dredge it. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Wheel Transportation Association, requesting subsidies for dredging the river to complete the project. Also, in the Lü River Estuary River channel in the fourth district, more than 300 people were hired to start dredging, but because the riverbed is all silt, construction is extremely difficult, resulting in little success after many days of work. The township heads of the twelve townships in the district decided on construction methods after discussion the day before. Each township sent dozens to more than one hundred workers, still paying wages, and dividing the sections for dredging, hoping to complete the entire project in one day. Yesterday, from 2:00 AM on the 15th, it was estimated that 1,500 to 1,600 workers arrived. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu also personally went to the countryside to supervise the work to save farmland. Currently, the section of the Lü River Estuary has been dredged completely, the river surface has been widened to three zhang, and the depth has reached four and a half feet. The amount of water has increased sharply. Once the entire project is completed,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>the dam must be removed. As for whether to widen the Xiangshui Bridge gate at Wangting Shadun Port, it will be discussed and decided after the Commissioner of the Department arrives in Wuxi. As for the manure pits inside and outside the city, most of them are full of manure and cannot be cleaned. The Public Security Bureau has now decided to set up four public pits to emphasize public hygiene. The prices of rice, fuel, vegetables, etc. in the city have soared in recent days, making it difficult for the poor to make a living.</p>
<p>The Ximen Shenxin Three Factories and other factories, because coal is about to run out, it is impossible to transport, so in the day, or will stop the factory, the four townships and towns of various businesses, also because the source of the cut off, are reported out of stock. On the same day, Yang Shoumei and others from the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce presented a report to the Provincial Department, requesting that personnel be dispatched to Chengjiang to investigate and select important construction work as soon as possible. The original telegram said that the Provincial Government had passed the method at the Provincial Government meeting on the 13th of this month in order to provide drought relief, and planned to draw water from both rivers and lakes, and irrigate the water inlets leading to rivers and lakes, and gather into the canal, so that all places have water to drain, even a little, which is of great concern to the people and the local people are impressed. However, in terms of the river openings in Jiangyin, Huangtian Port is the most important, Huangshan Port is second, and Xiagang is next. It is closely related to the water conservancy of Chengchangxi counties. As for the Lu Pu Port Estuary, it does not seem to be as important. Now the drought has been long, and the inner river needs water urgently. The tidal water will arrive at the mid-autumn festival, and the inland water irrigation can be used. It is proposed to send personnel to Cheng, from fast meeting with the county government, first of all, Huangtian ports, respectively, select the important construction, the fundamental must be fully dredged, the current can first draw water into the mouth, by which the inner river to inject, and protect the farmland of the counties, and Wuxi is slightly away from the river, although not entirely rely on the river water, but Jiangyin can import more river water, Wuxi can protect more lake water, Jiangyin's various estuary blockage, less river water has been a lot, this can prove it, Gaoqiao water flow, northward is very urgent, and Wuxi Shimizu more to Cheng state, We can see that the lake water is far away from Jiangyin, and there is a danger of drying up one day. It is reported that the local Mui and other people have a clearer understanding, and Wu Shuying, Gong Sunyi, Zhang Yingeng, and Lin Junbao of Wujin have come to Wuxi to discuss this matter, and their opinions are the same. Dare to ask for an examination, quickly send personnel to Cheng to meet with the county to select important construction, by which farmland irrigation, not to mention the most urgent fate,</p>
<h3>Northwestern Inspection Notes: Difficulty Traveling on Northwestern Post Roads; Special Reporter of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>Sent from Zhongwei on the 28th, dozens of troops were encountered, including a father and son carrying coal together. Asked about their living conditions, they replied that they could sell 300 catties of coal from Xiaheyan to the county town for one silver dollar. However, the county town is still more than 30 miles away from Xiaheyan. The father and son can only make one round trip a day, and each time they can only carry 150 catties of coal, which is worth about five jiao, to provide food for the whole family of five, so they often feel insufficient. Fortunately, the coal is produced in the open air and is easy to dig. After the old man finished speaking, he sighed endlessly. At Shijiazhuang, ten miles away, there are many peonies and herbaceous peonies. Yao purple and Wei yellow are gorgeous and eye-catching. Gardeners sell them by the bunch, five or six flowers per bunch, for only five jiao. Ten more miles to the river beach, the road is uneven, with mounds and pits blocking the way. People and cars are exhausted. The whip is used to encourage them to move forward, tracing the Taiping Canal westward. The sand is quite thick, and the wheels are almost completely submerged. The sand is mixed with large and small stones, and the car box is bumpy, making it impossible to sit comfortably. Two horses and a mule are panting and sweating, resting every five steps and stopping every ten steps.</p>
<p>The canal ends at the river. The high peak on the opposite bank is called Coal Mountain, and the amount of coal is very rich. The black layer is exposed and shines with oil. The river bank is also the same. There are two villages under the mountain, called Xiaheyan and Shangheyan, which are about a mile apart. Each has more than fifty households. High mountains stand behind them, and the Yellow River flows in front of them. They do not farm or graze, but specialize in mining coal. Occasionally, there are also those who burn pottery, but the sales are not wide. After going up the river for another twenty miles, suddenly a large sand slope blocked the way. The car was stopped for a break. The place is called Shabutou, and there are two households who make a living by ferrying and also grow five mu of vegetable gardens, living well.</p>
<p>Su Jiansan, President of the Ningxia High Court, arrived ahead of me with a large entourage. This trip was to carry out the Provincial Government's order to express gratitude to the authorities of the three provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi for their support in resolving the Sun army. According to him, before the Ningxia High Court was established, the county magistrate also handled judicial affairs, and the Public Security Bureau chief and district chiefs often overstepped their authority and accepted civil and criminal lawsuits. The cases judged by the county magistrate were actually overturned by the bureau and district chiefs, which was extremely chaotic. Later, the County Judicial Committee Office was established last year, and the Supreme Court was also established, and everything began to be organized. The Provincial Government will further promote it with strength, and the spirit of judicial independence will not be difficult to fully realize. After the soldiers robbed Ningxia Province, they urgently need to recuperate the people's strength. The soldiers are expensive and not numerous. The Fifteenth Route Army plans to shrink and become a fact soon. Later, they talked about the issue of harmonious relations between Han and Hui people in Gansu and Qinghai. Su said that the only way to remove the gap between Hui and Han is to popularize education in order to reconcile the extremist national character of each other and improve the cultural level of the whole people, then the feelings will become more harmonious. A. The shortcomings of the Han Chinese national character, relatively speaking, are about (1) no unity, (2) little knowledge of hygiene, (3) many addictions to smoking</p>
<p>alcohol, (4) habit of laziness, should use the Hui people's (1) unity, (2) reasonable doctrines, such as respecting the worship every day, must "get up early" · "bathe" · "purify the heart" · "exercise", and do not contaminate any "hobbies", (3) adventurous spirit, (4) diligence and frugality, etc., to make up for its defects. B. The shortcomings of the Hui national character, also relatively speaking, include (1) cultural backwardness, lack of knowledge, (2) narrow-mindedness, (3) temperament just storm, should be the Han "broad" "love" and other spirits, with educational methods, to save it. When education is first implemented, flexible methods must be adopted, and gentle means should be used. Among the courses to be taught, Hui rituals should be added appropriately, and the Hui day of worship may be used for weekly holidays, and then gradually improve, and it is not difficult to achieve good results. When Ma Zhenwu and Ba Fuxiang and other predecessors governed Gansu, they used this method to cultivate a lot of Hui talents. I (Su himself claimed) was one of those who had received such compulsory education, and I still feel very good about it.</p>
<p>Since there are sand ridges ahead blocking the road, the car items were unloaded onto the boat, so that the mules and horses could cross on their own, and the people and car items were carried by boat. Looking left and right, there are cliffs thousands of feet high, and the wind blows and the sand flows, forming like a waterfall. The highest point of the sand ridge passed by the mules and horses has a monastery, half buried by sand, which was built by philanthropists to specially provide tea and soup to help pedestrians. When sailing, the boatmen climbed the cliff and carried the cables, slowly hauling them on the shore by six people, two people paddling at the bow, and one person steering at the stern, echoing each other, all of which were extremely laborious. The Yellow River water flow is so rapid that the boat cannot move forward against it. The boatmen shuttle back and forth, three to five times a day when the water is low, and only once or twice a day when the water is high. The water journey is no more than ten miles, and each trip upstream takes more than two hours. The ferry fare is not fixed, and passengers voluntarily give more when they see the suffering. The Ninglan car takes another route.</p>
<p>Then leave the boat and land on the shore, turning into Xijing (i.e., Changliushui Jing),</p>
<p>Along the way, coal mountains are clustered and coal seams are exposed. There is a cave that is unfathomable. Throwing stones into it, the echoes rumble for a long time. Several crystals were picked up along the way, which were crystal clear and lovely. The larger ones are hollow and have water. When tilted, the water flows, like the mercury in a thermometer. At Mengjiawanzi, fifteen miles away, there are four or five village dwellings, engaged in farming and animal husbandry. There is no water during the day, and it starts to flow down from "Changliushui" at night. The sun sets and it gets dark, and the cars are confused. Grope forward. I was inspecting coal seams and playing with crystals along the way, not going forward or backward, alone in the middle of the road. Walking for five miles, I suddenly encountered a stream of water, gurgling and flowing, and the road was submerged. At this time, the bright moon rose in the east, and the mountains and forests were lush. The route was curved and winding, which made the moon mirror hang uncertainly. Suddenly, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and thunder and lightning were raging. The night was deep and the road was long, and I was frightened. I faintly heard the sound of dogs barking, like sending the gospel. As soon as I entered the village, the heavy rain came. The night was late and getting deeper, and there was no response to calling at the door. Fortunately, President Su and Mr. Xu had found a corner of a farmer's house, and when Luo Du and others arrived, their clothes were already wet. There were only eight households in the area, next to a river, so it was named "Changliushui". Because the troops came and went, many houses were demolished for fuel. There were many bedbugs on the kang. When the rain stopped and the moon was bright, the door panels were used as beds, lying in the open air and looking up at the moon. The feeling in it can only be explained to those who have experienced it, and it is difficult for those who have not experienced it to say it.</p>
<p>On the way, according to the county officials sent by Zhongwei, there are a total of sixty county officials in the county, divided into three teams. There is no salary on weekdays. They all rely on being sent to various townships to collect grain and taxes, and the tips they give to maintain their lives. I am afraid this situation is not just in one county. Also, when crossing the sand ridge, the mules and horses had already used too much strength, and when they arrived at "Changliushui", they still had to look up at a slope of one hundred and ten steps, which made it difficult to struggle up. Although the coachman repeatedly whipped them, they retreated again and again. Finally, with the help of President Su's two mules, they were able to walk up steadily. "It is really difficult to travel on the post roads in the Northwest," which is true.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Extremely Severe Drought; Farmers Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>The severity of the drought in this county is the highest among the six counties in Jiashan. Although the party and government agencies have various works such as dredging rivers and purchasing large numbers of pumping machines, and the local gentry and Buddhist associations have built</p>
<p>altars to pray for rain, the heat is high and there is no rain. The worry of farmers who commit suicide is heard every day. The details are as follows: (1) Shen Si Guan and Shen Changsheng, two farmers in Meizhai Bridge, witnessed the rice seedlings dying and could not be saved. They despaired of the autumn harvest and could not survive. They hanged themselves one after another. Fortunately, Shen Changsheng was noticed by someone and was able to recover. (2) Wang, the wife of Sun Guirong, a farmer in Xitao Chenghang, committed suicide by throwing herself into the river with her two young sons yesterday. Her husband was still bailing water in the fields. When he heard the news and rushed home, it was too late to save them. The husband was heartbroken when he saw the situation and vowed to die with them. The neighbors who heard about it were sad. (3) Wu Shunyu, a farmer in Xijinghui, committed suicide by hanging himself because the rice in the fields was withered and there was no way to ask for help. (4) Gu Qishou, a farmer in Hengjinggang, planted dozens of acres of land. He had been bailing water day and night and was already exhausted. Just as he was crying for help, a fierce landlord surnamed Mou asked for Chen rents. Gu Qishou was desperate and committed suicide by throwing himself into the river. The tragic situation in the countryside is difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Alas, it is regrettable.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Risheng Lou Bloodshed</h3>
<p>The shocking Risheng Lou bloodshed incident on Dongmen Main Street has captured the attention of everyone in society. However, the information published by local newspapers has been inaccurate. To clarify the truth for all sectors, our reporter rushed to the Yao residence yesterday and discovered the following facts: The deceased, Yao Bingheng, was 36 years old and a native of this county. He was the grandson of Yao Xinfu, a respected scholar and former official of the Qing Dynasty. His paternal uncle, Yao Douchu, currently serves as a judge in the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yao Bingheng lost his parents at a young age, and the family's fortunes declined, so he abandoned his studies and went into business. He was currently working as the accountant for the Hefeng Rice Mill in this county. He was known for his competence and diligence, and he was highly valued by the shareholders, who entrusted him with significant authority. Beside the mill, a gambling den was set up by a certain family. The person in charge was an unscrupulous member of the volunteer defense corps who indulged in all kinds of vices: smoking, gambling, prostitution, and other indulgences. Colleagues from the mill often frequented this place for entertainment. The other day, Yao went to this place to call his colleagues back to the mill. It happened that the sister of Li Shijie, who was acting as a member of the defense corps, was standing at the door. It is not known what misunderstanding occurred, but a conflict arose. Li Shijie's sister complained to her brother, who, the next afternoon, tricked Yao into going to Risheng Lou for tea with some local police officers. Yao did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, an argument broke out, and the two began to fight. A friend of Li's, Xu Mingde, who was also a member of the defense corps, passed by and entered upon hearing the commotion. He immediately ordered Li to hold Yao's hands and proceeded to beat Yao's waist with the iron handcuffs he was carrying. He also kicked Yao's lower abdomen and testicles with his leather shoes. Yao immediately vomited several mouthfuls of blood and collapsed to the ground. An employee of Fusheng Sauce Garden, Mr. Zhang, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and reported it to the public security station. Xu Mingde and Li Shijie, realizing they had caused a disaster, hired a boat and fled, taking with them two rifles belonging to the defense corps. Yao died from his injuries. His wife, upon hearing the news and witnessing her husband's tragic death, was overcome with grief and reported the incident to the local court for an autopsy. The chief prosecutor, Zhang Bing, led officials to conduct the autopsy and confirmed that Yao had died from severe injuries inflicted before his death. Xu Huowu, the head of the county's public security bureau, was furious upon hearing the news and immediately ordered the police chief to lead officers to arrest Li Shijie's wife and sister, as well as the local police officer Ji A'quan (Xu Mingde's brother), and bring them to the county. He also dispatched police to apprehend the fugitives. The deceased's family is currently hiring a lawyer to seek justice.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: The Drought Continues in Suzhou City; Slaughtering is Stopped Again</h3>
<p>The severe drought in the Suzhou area continues. The general public has initiated activities such as carrying dragon lanterns to pray for rain, with several such events occurring daily. The Yangwang Temple in Sibaidu has been holding processions for days, with grand ceremonial displays. Yesterday (the 15th), more than 300 monks from the Wuxian Buddhist Association gathered at Baoji Temple at 8:00 AM. They first went to the Sanqing Hall of Xuanmiao Temple to release caged birds and then went to the bronze Guanyin statue at Baolian Temple to pray for rain. The fresh meat industry has decided to continue suspending slaughtering for seven days, starting yesterday (the 15th). Recently, rice prices have been increasing daily. Although the county government has issued a clear order restricting rice prices from exceeding ten yuan, yesterday (the 15th), the rice price rose another fifty cents, currently selling at twelve yuan per picul, with the trend continuing upward. The city is already in the process of digging a large number of artesian wells to provide drinking water.</p>
<h3>Rogue Rapes Rural Woman and Robs Her of Belongings</h3>
<p>The rogues Xu Bingfu and Chen Xuesheng encountered a rural woman, Lu Jiashi, 29 years old, on Hengma Road the other day. They tricked her into a nearby alley, stole twenty-two silver dollars and clothing, and then lured her to Huangqiu Township, where Chen Xuesheng raped her repeatedly three times. On the 14th, Lu Jiashi was crying and making a fuss in Huangdai, where she was noticed by the police. After inquiring about the situation, the police immediately arrested Chen Xuesheng and Xu Bingfu and took them to the Ninth Branch Bureau before transferring them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Pingwang Security Guards Repel Bandits</h3>
<p>At the home of Ma Jinkui, a farmer in Pingwang Township, Wujiang County, who also serves as a member of the township's security corps, more than a dozen bandits armed with guns suddenly arrived on the night of the 13th and looted freely. Ma, hearing the noise, also resisted with a gun, but he was outnumbered and overpowered.</p>
<p>The bandits seized his guns and ammunition and looted silver dollars, clothing, and other items, carrying the loot away in a northeast direction. At that time, the fourth Jia, Yi, security guards of the township heard of the robbery and rushed to the scene, encountering the bandits on the road. Both sides opened fire. The bandits were defeated and fled towards the stream.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Gu Renfa Wanted</h3>
<p>Gu Renfa, the former Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, reported his wife, Li Shuyun, and his mother-in-law, Li Liu Shi, for selling official positions and titles. After an investigation by Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor of the local branch of the court, it was concluded that Li Shuyun and her mother were not suspected of any crime, and the case was dismissed. Thereupon, Li and her mother counter-sued Gu Renfa for false accusation and bigamy. However, Gu never appeared in court to be questioned. Li Liu Shi, on the grounds that Gu had falsely accused relatives and had repeatedly failed to appear despite summons, specially submitted a petition to the prosecutor's office, requesting the</p>
<p>arrest of Gu Renfa. Chief Prosecutor Qian, based on the petition, issued the following instruction yesterday: "The petition from Li Liu Shi et al., one item, accuses Gu Renfa of falsely accusing relatives and counter-suing for bigamy, etc. The defendant has repeatedly defied summons, requesting that he be arrested according to the law. Having read the petition, it is found that this case was previously reported to the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court for approval to be wanted due to the defendant Gu Renfa's repeated failure to appear. Let it be known." This is the instruction.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Food Committee Purchases Flour for Famine Relief</h3>
<p>The Wuyi Food Management Committee convened a meeting on the 14th, chaired by County Magistrate Cai. At that time,</p>
<p>the chairman proposed that due to the prolonged drought and lack of rain, there was a threat of disaster. He cited the oral instructions from Director Yu of the Civil Affairs Department to purchase miscellaneous grains with accumulated grain reserves for famine relief.</p>
<p>It was decided that the county's warehouses were already storing rice and that there was no spare space for additional storage. Furthermore, the price of rice was already high, so it would be more cost-effective to purchase and store flour. Lin Junbao and Zhou Jiping were publicly recommended to go to Wuxi to purchase 15,000 bags of second-grade flour for storage, with delivery in September, for future use.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Prohibition of Local Militias from Collecting Supplies from the People</h3>
<p>Xiang Zhizhuang, the Director of the Jiangsu Province Security Department, recently toured Jiangbei. He found that the local militias in various counties were causing great disturbance by collecting supplies from the people when they went to the countryside to suppress bandits. He has now ordered the county magistrates to strictly prohibit such practices and has authorized the public to report any violations.</p>
<h3>Serious Drought Disaster in Nantong Region</h3>
<p>The drought disaster in the counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi, and Jing in the Nantong region has become increasingly severe. The fields in the countryside are cracked, and the rice seedlings, cotton, and beans have withered. The rivers and canals are dried up, and farmers from the countryside are flocking to the city to petition the government to pray for rain. All sectors of Nantong are holding emergency meetings to discuss ways to provide relief</p>
<p>from the drought. It has been decided to purchase machinery to pump water from the harbor day and night for irrigation and to raise funds to purchase rice from rice-producing areas and transport it back to the county. Zheng Yitong, the commissioner of the Nantong region, in order to comply with public sentiment and in consideration of old customs, has specially stipulated the following methods for praying for rain, ordering the county magistrates to follow them: (1) Pray for rain. Local officials should lead their staff and the public to set up altars in open spaces to pray. When praying, gongs and alarm bells should be rung, and everyone should remain silent. Cannons should also be fired in open spaces as a warning. (2) Cleanse the land. Each household should thoroughly sweep and clean, and they should eat vegetarian food for ten days, abstaining from meat to show purity of heart. (3) Endure hardship. Officials and civilians in each district should jointly dredge rivers and divert tides for irrigation. (4) Rectify the heart. Sincerely repent, eliminate all bad habits.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Water Scarcity Due to Drought Leads to Fatal Incident</h3>
<p>The drought demon wreaks havoc, causing scorching heat and severe drought. Around 3:00 PM on the 13th, black clouds rose from the northwest, accompanied by thunder and lightning. The urban area and the eastern and western rural areas did not receive a drop of rain. Only Yunting, Gao'an, and Nanzha received some showers of one or two inches. A decades-old ginkgo tree in front of Nantang was struck by lightning and fell. The light showers were still not widespread, and recently, incidents of people losing their lives due to disputes over water in the countryside have occurred in several places. Lu Xuegen, a farmer from Beizhu, clashed with Xue Gengsheng, the operator of a motorized boat, over water rights at Lao Yangqi. He was</p>
<p>stabbed to death with a bamboo pole. Later, Xi Yuankang, the town chief of that place, mediated a settlement for 510 yuan. Tao Rongsheng, from the sixth Bao of Maxi Township, was beaten to death by Zhou Azhong in a dispute over</p>
<p>water. The incident was reported to the county on the 13th, and Cheng, the judicial investigator, went to the countryside to conduct an autopsy. The murderer has fled, and the accomplice, Zhou A'huai, has been taken to the county for interrogation. Four soldiers from the fifth battalion, sixth company of the artillery regiment stationed in Cheng were taking a cold bath in the Dongheng River due to the heat. One of them drowned. The body was taken to Zhouzhuang, where the company commander went to</p>
<p>collect it. The district chief reported the incident to the county for an autopsy. The county government, recognizing that the drought had become a disaster, had sent Cui Hualiang, the chief of the third section, to the provincial capital to seek instructions. The province considered that Jiangyin was located on the Yangtze River and was in better condition than other inland counties, so it did not list it as a drought-stricken county. After Cui repeatedly explained the situation, the province finally included it in the list of drought-stricken counties. It was decided to dredge the Huangtian Port and the South Canal to improve water conservancy. The</p>
<p>survey was scheduled for the 20th. The funding issue would be resolved jointly by the province and the county. Cui returned to Cheng on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Further Details on the Kidnapping and Robbery of Gui Youmu's Family</h3>
<p>The district headquarters of the seventh district under the county, located in Guijiazhuang,</p>
<p>was robbed by bandits some days ago. A hand-held machine gun and more than thirty rifles and box cannons were looted. Subsequently, Gui Youmu, the district commander's home was looted as well with losses of over 20,000 yuan. Gui's sisters, eldest daughter-in-law, and two militia members were kidnapped. It is now learned that after the bandits robbed Guijiazhuang, they went to the Chunhua Zhen district sub-headquarters and seized four rifles. The bandits have now released one of the militia members, instructing him to quickly raise 100,000 yuan and go to a certain place in Xingdai to negotiate the ransom for the other hostages.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of Sixteen People Kidnapped in Shuangmiao</h3>
<p>In Shuangmiao, a place about eight li northeast of the city, at about 8:00 PM on the 11th of this month, more than thirty bandits suddenly arrived. They split into two groups, one</p>
<p>going to Xisheng Township to loot and kidnap three villagers, Shen Xueru, Shen Xueren, and Shen Xuechu. The other group went to Xihe Township and abducted eleven people, including Feng Dayou, Lu Chenhang, the traveling merchant Wang Gufu, Wang Guangsheng, Wang Zhou Shi, and others. At the same time,</p>
<p>the boatmen Shen Wei and Huang Daju were also kidnapped and taken northeast. At 2:00 PM yesterday, six boatmen, including Shen Wei, were released. Each was given five jiao (half a dollar) and instructed to tell their families to prepare a ransom. If the ransom was not paid by the deadline, they would set fire and tear up the tickets, etc.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Old Woman Throws Herself into the River to Pray for Rain, Rescued</h3>
<p>The wife of Zhang Xingchu, the deputy director of the Ningbo Commercial Bank and manager of Hengsheng Money Shop, is over fifty years old, eats vegetarian food, worships Buddha, and firmly believes in karma. Recently, seeing that there had been no rain for a long time and a drought disaster had occurred, causing suffering for the people, she bid farewell to her family yesterday (the 13th) morning, saying that she was going to Zhaobao Mountain to offer incense. She hired a boat to cross to the shore of Shangtianzhu River. After the boatman turned back, she rushed back to the riverbank and threw herself into the water to offer her life in prayer for rain. Fortunately, the boatman and the guards of the Zhenhai Fort communication squad rescued her, and she was saved. Her family has now gone to Zhenhai to bring her back.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Construction of Qiantang River Railway Bridge: All Funding Secured; Construction Can Begin Immediately</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Zhejiang Provincial Government's Department of Construction is raising funds from Shanghai banks for the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. According to news from banking circles in this city yesterday, the Zhejiang Department of Construction believes that the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge is crucial to the east-west transportation in the province, so it has resolved to actively build it to facilitate public travel. Due to the wide river surface and turbulent water flow, the construction project is estimated to require 5.5 million yuan. Of this amount, 3.5 million yuan has been secured through a loan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, but 2 million yuan is still unfunded. Therefore, Director Zeng Yangfu and others from the Zhejiang Department of Construction came to Shanghai last month to secure a loan of 2 million yuan from the China, Communications, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Industrial, Siming, and Five Banks to carry out the project. The loan is scheduled to be disbursed in five installments. The first batch of 300,000 yuan was fully disbursed by the end of June, and the second batch of 350,000 yuan has now begun to be disbursed. The third, fourth, and fifth batches will also be disbursed according to the contract. As for the Qiantang River Railway Bridge project, the provincial authorities are actively preparing for it and have already organized a construction engineering association to plan everything. The entire project can begin after the bidding process is completed.</p>

<h3>Duan Qirui to Go to Mount Lu for Summer Retreat; Chairman Chiang and Others Send Telegrams to Shanghai to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>Since Duan Qirui came to Shanghai to reside last year, he has expressed that he would not ask or hear about political matters. Recently, Mr. Duan decided to go to Mount Lu for a summer retreat due to the hot weather this summer and his old age and frailty. He had already telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek of Jiangxi and Xiong Shihui, the chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, the other day, stating his intention to go to Jiangxi for recuperation. It is now learned that after receiving the telegram, Chairman Chiang immediately ordered his subordinates to find a suitable Western-style house in Guling and arrange everything for him. He also telegraphed Mr. Duan yesterday, inviting him to come to Lu immediately. At the same time, Mr. Duan also received a telegram from Xiong Shihui, the chairman of the province, expressing his welcome. Therefore, Mr. Duan has informed Mayor Wu that he will take a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship to leave soon.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Procures Foreign Rice Due to Drought; Rice Industry Association Held Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shin Shih News Agency reports that due to the drought for a month, a disaster has occurred, and rice prices have skyrocketed, causing panic among the people. The Bean and Rice Industry Association of this city, in order to comply with the order from the Social Affairs Bureau to stop the excessive soaring of rice prices to avoid hindering the people's food supply, specially convened a general meeting of all members yesterday and decided on several important cases. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association convened a general meeting of all members at Cuixiu Hall at 3:00 PM yesterday, with a total of seventy-two attendees, including Gu Xinyi, Cai Yukun, Chen Jieyi, Zhu Yunzhang, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Jiang Hongbin, Jiang Zisheng, and others. All the famous merchants on Dou Market Street attended. Gu Xinyi was publicly elected as chairman.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Gu Xinyi then reported the purpose of the meeting, saying, in brief, "In this scorching weather, when we are all sweating profusely, so many members have come to the meeting, which shows that although merchants aim to make profits, they also pay attention to the food supply of the general public. Today's meeting is because we received an instruction from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday that rice prices have suddenly risen by two or three yuan in a few weeks, which is unbearable for ordinary people. We should immediately formulate a method to suppress the rice prices. However, due to the severe drought and lack of rain, the disaster is already inevitable. The source of rice is scarce, and the market price will naturally tend to rise. For the sake of the interests of the consuming society, we naturally cannot allow high-priced rice. I hope that our colleagues will quickly devise a method to suppress rice prices to reassure the public."</p>
<h3>Important Resolutions</h3>
<p>All the attending members, after a lengthy and serious discussion of the chairman's report, summarized it into two measures: short-term and long-term. (1) Short-term measure: notify all colleagues to limit the maximum market price of white rice to no more than thirteen yuan. (2) Long-term measure: The chairman, in the name of the Food Control Design Committee, should propose to the Executive Yuan to issue a tax-free import permit for foreign rice, and first purchase 500,000 dan of foreign rice, which will be issued by the Food Design Committee to our association to suppress rice prices. The above two measures were unanimously passed after discussion by the general meeting.</p>
<h3>Notice to Colleagues</h3>
<p>Based on the resolution, the Bean and Rice Industry Association issued an urgent notice last night, notifying colleagues that from today onwards, the price of top-grade white rice must not exceed thirteen yuan. The entire rice industry in the city has complied with the resolution of the association, and it is expected that there will be no more price spikes in the shortest possible time. However, the fundamental solution is still to purchase more rice to seek relief.</p>
<h3>Gu to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Xinyi will go to Beijing tomorrow in the name of a member of the Food Committee to request the Executive Yuan for tax-free purchase of a large quantity of foreign rice. It is investigated that the import tax on foreign rice, which was originally imposed due to the low price of grain hurting farmers, had been appealed for several years and was finally successful on November 16th last year. Now, due to the severe drought in Jiangnan, although the extent of restoring tax-free imports has not been reached, the government takes the people's food as a priority and, depending on the needs of the domestic market, should allow tax-free imports within a certain limit to adjust domestic market prices. To achieve swift and agile procedures and import in the shortest possible time will be effective. Mr. Gu's trip to Beijing should obtain the understanding of the authorities and achieve the goal of tax-free imports.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Purchasing Rice</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu's visit to Beijing is expected to have the above suggestions submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on Wednesday of this week. On Thursday, it can be handed over to the meetings of the three departments of Finance, Real Estate, and Internal Affairs. If passed, it will then be handed over to the Food Control Design Committee for processing. If there are no other obstacles, an order can be telegraphed to Saigon on Friday to purchase rice, which is expected to be shipped to China in three or four days and arrive in Shanghai, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Highway Bond Pays Twelfth Installment; Yesterday's Letter to Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association to Transfer Payments to Gentry and Merchants</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Provincial Association of this city received a letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the Zhejiang Province Highway Bond, which was issued in the seventeenth year, has now reached the period for the twelfth installment. The last two digits of the winning numbers are 14, 48, and 92. Any Zhejiang merchants and gentry in Shanghai holding the bond, whether it is 500 yuan, 100 yuan, 10 yuan, or 5 yuan, whose last two digits are the same as these three numbers, can start receiving the payment from this month. They can hold the bond and submit the interest coupons for the thirteenth to sixteenth periods to receive the payment from the Zhejiang Local Bank and the county governments and treasuries. If they do not withdraw the money within two years, it will be invalid, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Heat Was Lower; Fewer Patients in Epidemic Hospitals</h3>
<p>Yesterday's heat was lower, with a maximum of 98.1 degrees, so it seems that the number of people seeking medical treatment at the various epidemic hospitals has decreased. To clarify the details, the number of consultations at each hospital as of 8:00 PM yesterday and the total number of outpatient visits the day before are listed below:</p>
<p>Hospital Address Outpatient Inpatient Immunization Death Previous Day</p>
<p>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Xizang Road 198 106 50 4 254</p>
<p>Emergency Epidemic Hospital Kaifeng Road 156 20 90 176</p>
<p>Red Cross Epidemic Hospital Xinmin Road 151 28 32 215</p>

<h3>Municipal Drought Relief Committee Began Work Yesterday; Water Pumping and Bailing Work in Progress</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Drought Relief Committee, jointly formed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Finance Bureau, Land Bureau, and Municipal Farmers' Association, officially began work at Yishiyuan, Ningheyuan Road, Nanshi, yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Wu Huanru, the chief of the second section, and all the staff of the agricultural section, the Finance Bureau sent Shen Tong, the Public Security Bureau sent Yuan Hongqi, the Land Bureau sent a clerk named Jin, and the staff of the Municipal Farmers' Association, etc., to work together in the Drought Relief Committee. Yesterday afternoon, the municipal commissioners of each district went to discuss the water bailing issue. According to the person in charge of the committee, there are currently three things being handled: (1) Purchase or borrow water pumps. So far, more than twenty pumps have been obtained and distributed to each district for application. (2) Water bailing barges. A deal has been arranged with Director Song of the Junpu Bureau to borrow two barges, each with 2,000 horsepower, all powered by electricity, capable of discharging 400 million gallons of water per day. Song has agreed to this matter and will further discuss it with the bureau's engineers. (3) For the purpose of irrigation in drought relief work, it is also planned to borrow fire engines. The Public Security Bureau has contacted the Fire Brigade regarding the fire engines, and the Fire Brigade has agreed to allocate ten vehicles for use in the Puxi districts. As for the water problem, how to distribute the water and how to irrigate will be determined after the municipal commissioners of each district come to the committee to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Zhu Hongen of Wang Delin's Troops Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Reported to the Office; Japanese Conspiracy and Ambition; Righteous Army's Bloody Battle Against the Enemy and Puppets</h3>
<p>Li Yanlu, the vanguard commander of the guerrilla army of Wang Delin's troops, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Righteous Army, specially sent adjutant Zhu Hongen, carrying a report on the battle with the enemy, to enter the customs, pay respects to Commander-in-Chief Wang, report and request instructions. Zhu arrived in Tianjin on the 10th, paid respects to Wang and reported, and then arrived in Shanghai by the Pinghu Tong train at 7:40 AM yesterday. He went to the office to report. A reporter from the Far East News Agency, upon hearing the news, immediately visited Zhu at his residence, where he was granted an audience and spoke in detail about the Japanese and puppet conspiracy and showed the report. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Entering the Customs with a Mission</h3>
<p>I (Zhu referred to himself) was ordered to enter the customs on the 12th of last month. I walked from a small path in Dongning to Dongjingcheng. From Dongjingcheng, I traveled to Harbin. At noon on the 28th, I finally arrived in Shenyang. After resting for three days, I detoured to Ping on the morning of the 2nd of this month. I finally arrived in Tianjin on the 10th of this month. The journey was delayed because I was carrying documents and dared not take a car. At the same time, the inspection was strict, and I was afraid of negligence. When I arrived in Tianjin, I had already reported to Wang and requested instructions. I arrived here this morning under orders to report to the office.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plot to Occupy Inner Mongolia</h3>
<p>The treatment this year is even worse than last year, the cruel treatment is ten times worse than last year. They collude with traitors, bribe Mongol princes, and fund the organization of a republic to secede from our</p>
<p>central government and merge with the puppet state of Manchukuo. They fabricate various false declarations and think nonsense in everything in order to destroy our national system. It is truly heartbreaking to say.</p>
<h3>Setting Up a Gas Plant</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese are planning a most vicious thing, which is currently in progress. They plan to set up a poison gas plant near Linjiang County, near Changbai Mountain in Jilin, to manufacture poison weapons, exterminate the Righteous Army and the resisting people, and plan to use them in wars with certain countries. The plant is expected to be completed after autumn. I am specially entering the customs to ask the people of the country to stop them as soon as possible and hope that the people of the country will rush to manufacture gas masks to donate to the people of Northeast China and the Righteous Army, so that they will not be wiped out by them.</p>
<h3>Actively Increasing Troops</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of last month, the Japanese have actively increased their troops in the Northeast, increasing by one-third compared to last year. Most of them are concentrated in the area near Yuguan, planning to disturb North China to facilitate the annexation of Inner Mongolia, calling it the expansion of the puppet Manchukuo capital, but in fact, the Japanese want to move all the Korean people to the Northeast and then eliminate the puppet government. The entire North China will be under their control. This conspiracy has been completely exposed in the Northeast, and I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Attacking Mishan</h3>
<p>On May 25, Brigadier General Yang led his direct troops, and at 9:00 PM that day, our army approached the suburbs of the city and began the siege for about an hour. Part of our troops completely wiped out the puppet army's outpost company. The main force surrounded the puppet army's Tian Detachment and fought fiercely for several hours. The enemy could not hold on and retreated in a panic. At the same time, our army opened the prison and all the prisoners escaped. More than a dozen local running dogs were captured, and a large search was conducted. More than a hundred bags of rice and flour and a lot of coarse and fine cloth were transported out. When the Self-Defense Corps came to help, our army, having suffered losses, did not resist them and ordered a retreat. At this time, Regiment Commander Shan also led his troops to attack, and they came into contact with the Self-Defense Corps and were repulsed by the battle group.

<h3>Zhejiang Province Statewide Communication with Shanghai: Regulations Announced Yesterday, Effective from the 16th</h3>
<p>Due to various issues, the Ministry of Communications' handling of Zhejiang long-distance telephone services and the Zhejiang Provincial handling of long-distance telephone services had not been able to cooperate, resulting in the Ministry's Shanghai-Hangzhou line not being able to connect to the entire Zhejiang Province. This was regretted by the people of Shanghai and Zhejiang. Recently, both the Ministry and the Province felt that if this matter was not urgently resolved, it would not only cause inconvenience to the people, but also hinder the progress of both parties' businesses, with a significant impact. Recently, after earnest consultations between the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau and the Ministry of Communications, their opinions were very close. Detailed regulations were peacefully established through open and honest communication between the two parties. From now on, all parts of Zhejiang Province can communicate with Shanghai. According to reporters, the content of the regulations agreed upon by both parties includes the following points: (1) All long-distance telephone services operated by the Ministry of Communications in various counties in Zhejiang (except the Shanghai-Hangzhou trunk line) will cease operations by the end of June. (2) The Ministry of Communications will take back the Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance trunk line built by the Provincial Telephone Bureau at a price of 48,000 yuan, making it the Ministry's property. (3) The Ministry of Communications will completely transfer the telephone business to the Province for takeover and management by the night of July 15. The Ministry of Communications' Zhejiang Long-Distance Management Office will be abolished at the same time. (4) The telephone operators of the Ministry of Communications' branch bureaus in various counties will be transferred to the Provincial Telephone Bureau. (5) The Provincial Telephone Bureau's business will contribute 5/1000 of its revenue as a license fee to the Ministry of Communications. It is reported that the Ministry's long-distance telephone service ceased operations at the end of last month, and the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau has scheduled to begin statewide communication with Shanghai from the 16th of this month. In addition, where the Ministry of Communications has not established telegraph offices in various counties of Zhejiang Province, all incoming and outgoing telegrams will be entrusted to the Provincial Telephone branch offices for collection and delivery, which has also been agreed upon by both parties and will be implemented simultaneously with the long-distance telephone cooperation regulations. (See today's advertising column for charts and tables.)</p>
<h3>More Convenient Than Before</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Zhejiang Provincial long-distance telephone service, after consultation between the Ministry of Communications and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has been entrusted to the province for handling starting today. One pair each of the copper wire lines No. 12 of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Fengjing lines established by the province, along with all the wooden poles from Shanghai to Hangzhou, will be purchased by the Ministry at a negotiated price. The methods for communicating with Shanghai from various locations in Zhejiang Province, as well as the fee rates, etc., have also been agreed upon by both the Ministry and the Province, and orders have been issued separately to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Hangzhou Provincial Telephone Bureau to comply. The Ministry already has a pair of direct line No. 12 between Shanghai and Hangzhou, so from today, there can be two pairs of direct lines communicating with Hangzhou simultaneously. Other bureaus in Zhejiang Province outside of Hangzhou and Jiaxing can also be transferred by the Hangzhou and Jiaxing bureaus to communicate with Shanghai. In the future, communication between Shanghai and Zhejiang will be more convenient than before. The province's original paging telephone service will also cease operations from today.</p>

<h3>Stamp Salesmen Should Promote Sales in Accordance with Regulations</h3>
<p>A letter from Dong Hongjun, a stamp tax salesman in sections 4 and 5, to salesmen in various districts: I am writing to inform you that the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau's order No. 615 states that stamp tax tickets can be sold in various provinces and regions, and cross-border sales are not allowed. The price of the tax tickets has already been stipulated on the face of the ticket, and it is not allowed to sell them at inflated or depreciated prices. This has been notified and followed in the past. Recently, some salesmen in various districts have complied with the regulations, but there have also been cases of cross-border sales and depreciated sales, which are against the regulations. It should be known that each salesman only has the power to sell tax tickets in his own district, and should work hard to promote sales in the district in order to ensure smooth tax collection. All salesmen receive flowers according to the face value of the tickets and withdraw sales expenses in accordance with the regulations, without any difference. They should all sell at the face value of the tickets to ensure uniformity. If they make a business of infringing sales and use depreciation as a gimmick, competition and disputes will never end, so what can be accomplished? For this reason, you are hereby ordered to comply. In the future, you must promote sales in accordance with the regulations. If there are any more cases of infringing sales and depreciated sales, once discovered, they will be severely punished. Be sure to abide by this order and do not violate it. This is the order. You should all comply and continue your friendship. I wish you all the best. Therefore, you should comply. From the 5th of this month, all stores in this district will sell flowers at the actual price according to the face value of the tickets, regardless of the size of the amount, in order to maintain the regulations. This is a corresponding letter to your superiors. I hope you will check it out and continue our friendship. I wish you all the best.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A: Further Discussion on Absolute Truth and Relative Truth | Reply to Lin Fei Jun |</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>After reading your "Relative Truth and Absolute Truth," I have some questions and request you to answer them publicly.</p>
<p>First, you believe that absolute truth is the sum of relative truths, which I find somewhat incorrect. Absolute truth is developed synthetically from relative truths, not merely the sum of relative truths. The difference between the two is not only quantitative, but also qualitatively different. You say that absolute truth is multifaceted, and relative truth is one aspect of it, which is correct; but is the sum of all aspects of relative truth equal to absolute truth? Incorrect. Take the example of the blind men touching the elephant. The elephant's head, nose, teeth, legs, body... are all parts of the elephant. The concepts that are reflected in the minds of the blind men each become a relative truth about the elephant. But does putting these parts together equal a living elephant? Incorrect! Since you know that "a relative truth has the possibility of developing into an absolute truth," and since you know that "human understanding gradually approaches absolute truth through the process of relative truth," why do you still believe that absolute truth is the sum of relative truths?</p>
<p>Second, while stating that absolute truth is a permanent and universal truth, you also point out that "absolute truth itself is not completely fixed and unchanging..." How can this contradiction be explained? I believe that the so-called absolute truth is the true law of objective reality, and it has absoluteness and permanence. The progress of human understanding can only get closer to it, even completely grasp it, but it cannot affect the truth itself. "...Compared to the infinitely diverse universe, the absolute truth we have reached is still relatively incomplete. It only has absolute and complete meaning in a certain stage of our practice. The more practice develops, the richer the content of absolute truth becomes, and the higher its value as truth increases." I feel that what you are saying here about absolute truth is actually relative truth. Otherwise, what is the difference between absolute truth and relative truth?</p>
<p>- From a letter from Lin Fei</p>
<p>The relative and absolute nature of truth is a complex and extremely important issue in philosophy. Lin Wenjun raised these two key questions about our previous article on this issue. Here are the answers:</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, our opinion is not different from Lin Wenjun's. We say that relative truth can develop into absolute truth, which Lin Jun will not deny. But Lin Jun's doubt lies in the word "sum" that we used. He believes that absolute truth is not just the sum of relative truths, but should be "synthetically developed." On this point, we must first point out that in the previous text, our conclusion was: "Absolute truth is the sum, total, or conclusion of relative truths," and not simply "sum." Lin Wen ignored the words "total or conclusion" below, hence this misunderstanding. We never regarded absolute truth as merely a mechanical collection of relative truths. We added "total or conclusion" to indicate that the sum we are talking about is a developing sum. Moreover, upon close examination, the sum of all things is not just a quantitative difference for those things. When it reaches the stage of a sum, the quality will naturally change. Although five is the sum of two and three, the nature of the number five is different from two or three. Take the story of the blind men touching the elephant as an example. The blind man who touches the leg says the elephant is a bit like a pillar, the one who touches the belly says it's like a wall, the one who touches the nose says it's like a snake, and so on. Each person has their own relative and incomplete truth. But if everyone can touch other parts from one part, then everyone's knowledge will develop. Eventually, everyone agrees that the elephant is made up of various parts, some of which are like pillars, some like walls, and some like snakes... In this way, the overall impression of the elephant that each person gets (absolute truth) is still nothing more than the sum of each person's relative truth. At the same time, this summed-up impression is not only quantitatively different from the previous individual impressions, but also qualitatively different, because the overall impression is definitely not the same as the impression of a pillar or the impression of a wall. In short, for any matter in the universe, if its quantity increases to a certain degree, it will inevitably cause a change in quality. There will never be anything that only increases in quantity without changing in quality. Lin Jun believes that the word "sum" only contains the meaning of quantitative change and not the meaning of qualitative change. Isn't this because he has not deeply thought about the meaning of "sum"? Of course, Lin Jun's phrase "synthetically developed" is very correct, but it is also appropriate for us to say that absolute truth is the sum of relative truths, because we added the phrase "total or conclusion" below to indicate that this sum is a developing sum and that it is not a mechanical collection.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, we believe that absolute truth also contains relativity within it, so absolute truth can be continuously improved due to the infinite progress of human understanding. Since it is absolute truth, it certainly has permanence and universality, but permanence and universality are different from "fixed and unchanging." The permanence and universality of absolute truth cannot hinder its development. For example, Newton's law of universal gravitation is a permanent and universal truth applied in the universe. After the appearance of Einstein's theory of relativity, Newton's law was reformed, but Newton's law could not be fundamentally overturned because of this. Newton's law still has absolute value after the appearance of the theory of relativity, but the method of explaining this law is more complete, making the content of this law richer. Another example is the emergence of quantum theory in physics, which makes people feel that Newton's gravity can only be applied strictly to the large universe and cannot be applied to the tiny world of electrons. Or, in the large universe, Newton's law is a necessary law, while in the electron world, it is only a probabilistic law, that is, it only has a certain degree of accuracy and is not strictly accurate. But even though it is a probabilistic law, the universal applicability of Newton's law has not been fundamentally overturned.</p>
<p>From the above examples, we can know that absolute truth also contains relativity. Relative truth and absolute truth can never be regarded as two things that are isolated from each other. Relative truth can develop into absolute truth, so it has the seeds of absolute truth within it. Absolute truth is composed of the sum of relative truths, so it itself will not be fixed and perfect, and still has infinite potential for development. As Lin Jun said, "Absolute truth is the law of objective reality." When truth reaches the stage of absoluteness, it has grasped a major principle of things, so it has permanence and universality. But at the same time, it has only reached the level of principle, and cannot therefore reject the enrichment and improvement of its content.</p>
<p>That's our answer. If readers still have doubts, please feel free to raise them!</p>

<h3>Lightning Strikes Villager Dead A Bolt From The Blue Causes Zhu Yunbao's Death By Electrocution His Body Is Found Blackened Upon Encoffining</h3>
<p>Zhu Yunbao, a farmer from Xiaozhu Village, Panmao Township, Baoshan County, northwest of Wusong, was 39 years old. He owned more than 100 mu of fertile land and his family was well-off. In the afternoon of the previous day, the weather was hot and there were dense clouds but no rain. Zhu went out alone from his home, intending to go to Gujia Village for tea. Unexpectedly, on the way, about half a mile from his home, a bolt of lightning suddenly struck from the sky, and Zhu immediately fell to the ground in response, dying of electrocution. There were many onlookers at the time, all marveling at the strange event of a bolt from the blue striking a person to death. Zhu's family soon learned of this, and carried the body back home.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the body was encoffined, it was found to be completely blackened.</p>
<h3>The Disturbance on Qujiang Road the Previous Night Italian Soldiers Injure Rickshaw Puller The Crowd Brawls With Italian Soldiers Again</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, at 8:30 last night (the 14th), three Italian sailors on Qujiang Road outside North Sichuan Road clashed with Chinese people for some reason. One of them was severely injured by a knife and may die. Initially, an Italian sailor and a rickshaw puller were fighting each other. The rickshaw puller, Xu Xiaosanzi, suffered severe injuries around both eyes and face. At the time, Mocross, a sailor from the Italian gunboat Sebastiano Caboto, age 22, was standing by and watching the fight with another sailor. Soon, a crowd gathered, seeing the rickshaw puller in great distress and unable to support himself, and shouted to make trouble for the sailor who was beating the rickshaw puller and the two sailors standing by. In an instant, the situation turned bad, and some people brought sticks and knives to fight with the three sailors. Mocross was injured in the commotion. These three sailors had left a certain wine shop on Zhu Bao San Road at 5:30 in the afternoon, each hiring a rickshaw, first going to the Navy Youth Association on Sichuan Road, ordering the rickshaw pullers to wait at the door. When they came out, they ordered them to pull to the Erlduladu wine shop and dance hall on Qujiang Road. Upon arriving there, it was already around 8:30. The three of them went inside to drink beer, still instructing the rickshaw pullers to wait outside, saying they would go elsewhere. One of the rickshaw pullers, apparently feeling tired from the long journey, did not want to wait any longer and asked for the fare. The sailor in the rickshaw refused to pay and, because of language barriers, a dispute arose. The Italian sailor, relying on his strength, knocked the rickshaw puller down, causing injuries and bleeding to the rickshaw puller's head, eyes, teeth, and jaw. The two Italian sailors standing by then drove away the gathered crowd, not allowing them to approach. Before long, the rickshaw puller was punched to the ground and lost consciousness. The Chinese onlookers all felt indignant. With a shout, they fought with the three sailors. Some wielded sticks and knives. When the Chinese police arrived, both the rickshaw puller and the Italian sailor Mocross were lying on the ground. The Chinese police immediately dispersed the crowd, rescued the Italian sailor, and sent the injured sailor to the Public Hospital by car. It was said that his injuries were quite dangerous last night. The rickshaw puller who was beaten unconscious was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Xinzha Road. After emergency treatment, he regained consciousness, but his head and eyes were covered with scars, and there was a risk of blindness. During the mutual beating, the commotion was very great. By the time the police arrived, the trouble had subsided, and it was impossible to tell who the perpetrator was. Therefore, this case is currently under thorough investigation by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Sued for Debt Request to Suspend Litigation Court Rejects the Request</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Bandit Suppression of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, was sued by American Mackton in the First Special District Local Court for debt. Zhang hired a lawyer to file a statement arguing that the court had no jurisdiction and requesting a suspension of the litigation. The judge was instructed to wait for a ruling, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the defendant Zhang Xueliang's request has been rejected by the trial judge, Mo Runhua, and he was ordered to bear the costs of the request. The debt sued for by Mackton was the cost of constructing the Commander's Office when Zhang Xueliang was the Border Defense Commander of the Three Northeastern Provinces, amounting to more than 200,000 yuan. Since the Northeast was occupied by the violent Japanese, and Zhang moved to Beiping, the Commander's Office was no longer ours, so it was difficult to manage all the unfinished business related to the office. Last year, when Zhang resigned and came to Shanghai as a recluse, living in the French Concession, a Westerner named Hanmen hired a lawyer to sue Zhang in the Second Special District Local Court. Zhang had already gone abroad, and after careful consideration of how to serve the summons, the Second Special District Court decided to serve it by public announcement. After the deadline, Zhang still did not appear in court. The court's trial result was that it had no jurisdiction and, because the plaintiff was American, transferred the case to the First Special District Local Court for management. However, although Zhang himself never appeared, the lawyer he hired argued that the public announcement and transfer of jurisdiction made by the Second Special District Local Court were illegal and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court. Now, because the First Special District Local Court has accepted the case, Zhang's lawyer has again requested the court to suspend the litigation, saying that since Zhang has appealed to the Supreme Court, the litigation process should be suspended until the Supreme Court makes a decision, because the lower court has the duty to be bound by the judgment of the higher court. Judge Mo rejected his request, in accordance with Article 178 of the Civil Procedure Law, which stipulates that if a judgment in whole or in part of a litigation is based on whether a legal relationship in another litigation is established, the court may order the suspension of the litigation process until the other litigation is concluded. In this case, the petitioner and Mackton are seeking compensation for construction costs. The case was ruled by the Second Special District Local Court to be transferred to this court for trial. The petitioner requested suspension of the litigation process on the grounds that an appeal had been filed, etc. This court found that the petitioner's case with Hanmen for compensation for construction costs had nothing to do with this case. Although the petitioner disputed the issue of jurisdiction in that case, it was not a prerequisite for this case. This court believes that the request is unfounded and should be rejected, etc.</p>
<h3>Foolish Couple Attempts Suicide Two Lovers, One Alive, One Dead A Family Tragedy</h3>
<p>Zhu Wangshi, a woman from Nanxiang, was 54 years old and had one son and one daughter. The eldest daughter was married to Huang Zhengyan, the director of the Songjiang Tax Bureau, but the daughter still lived with her mother on weekdays. The younger son, named Rongsen, was 26 years old. When her husband, Wende, was alive, he started a packaged meals business and accumulated a lot of wealth. After Wende died, his son Rongsen independently opened the Nanxing Hotel on the Damatou in the southern city. There was a young woman named Wang Lanying, 27 years old. Her husband, Mr. Gu, had been farming in Songjiang. In May of last year, Lanying came to Shanghai by car because the harvest in the fields was not good and the family's finances were becoming increasingly difficult. She stayed at the Nanxing Hotel, intending to find a matchmaking shop to find a master's household to work for as a servant. At that time, Rongsen saw her. Because the woman was beautiful and gentle, he fell in love with her at first sight and offered her hospitality, taking the opportunity to seduce her. Lanying eventually fell for Rongsen's youth and handsomeness, and also because he was the owner of the hotel, so she was also interested. The two of them had physical relations, and because they lived in the hotel together, they were with each other morning and evening, so their feelings for each other grew stronger day by day. However, before long, the matter was discovered by Zhu's mother, Wang. Because Rongsen had already been engaged to the daughter of Li Hongchun, a sandboat owner in Shenjia Village, Pudong, she could not allow him to be in love with a married woman. Therefore, she strongly opposed her son's desire to marry Lanying, and forced Rongsen to leave Lanying. But Rongsen was so deeply in love with the woman that he turned a deaf ear to his mother's words. At that time, the Nanxing Hotel, which Zhu operated, closed down because of years of poor business and excessive losses. Later, Zhu moved to the Hengxingli Xinxin Clothing Shop on Limalu in the Sixteen Pups, and in the spring of this year, he and his friend Lu jointly opened a Rongcha store in the Wangjia Zuijiao area. Recently, Zhu also proposed to cancel the previous engagement and lived with Lanying in the house at No. 71 Huayi Street, living together and vowing to stay together forever. But his mother, Wang, was very angry, so she often went to that place with her eldest daughter to scold Rongsen and Lanying, causing incessant quarrels, and vowing that she would not give up until her son broke up with the woman. However, Zhu, resentful of his mother's stubbornness, suddenly had the thought of ending his life. So, at around 10 p.m. the day before, he went out and bought 1.5 yuan of opium, took it home, lit it and made several opium pills. Then, he closed the door tightly, first ordered his lover Lanying to swallow four opium pills, and then took the remaining opium pills himself, swallowed them with water. He then hooked Lanying's neck with his arm, lay on the bed with his eyes closed, and quietly waited for death to come. Around 2 a.m., the two of them began to moan in agony due to the poisoning, which was heard by the person living with them. They pried open the door and rushed in, quickly sending the two to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Lanying recovered because she took a smaller dose of poison, but Rongsen died because he took too much poison, and the treatment was ineffective. He died at around 10 a.m. yesterday.</p>

<h3>Joint Announcement by Two Bureaus to Promote Citizens to Prepare Their Own Trash Cans Public Trash Cans to Be Removed from the 15th The Pilot Program in Two Areas and Two Departments Has Been Effective Now Promoted in Departments of Districts 1, 4 and 5</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the heads of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security and Health Bureaus issued a joint announcement stating that, after investigation, the bureaus had previously found that citizens were randomly dumping garbage everywhere, and not into the trash cans. Every time, the cans were empty, while the area outside the cans was littered with garbage. Investigation and punishment were difficult to carry out thoroughly. Therefore, in order to rectify the cleanliness of the roads and effectively improve the sanitation methods, the bureaus jointly decided to first stop using public trash cans in the jurisdiction of the Second Department of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau, and instead have each shop prepare its own trash can indoors. The cleaners of the Health Bureau would then go to collect and transport the trash on time every day, so as to avoid random dumping and maintain the cleanliness of the roads. Since the implementation of this method, it has been effective. Now, after discussion by the bureaus, it has been decided to implement the aforementioned method in the jurisdiction of the Third Department of the First District, the Fourth District, the Fifth District, and the Fifth Department of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau from July 30th, 23rd year. The residents and shops in the area must prepare trash cans in the same way before July 25th. If they fail to do so within the deadline, the bureaus will prepare them on their behalf and charge the price. In addition to the style of the trash cans that has been made and delivered to the Third Department of the First District, the Fourth District, the Fifth District, and the Fifth Department of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau for public viewing, the methods are copied below for public notice. Attach a copy of the methods for shops in the Third Department of the First District, the Fourth District, the Fifth District, and the Fifth Department of the Fifth District to prepare their own trash cans. (1) Within the area (i.e., the jurisdiction of the Third Department of the First District, the Fourth District, the Fifth District, and the Fifth Department of the Fifth District), the old trash cans will be removed from July 15th, 23rd year. Each shop is responsible for preparing its own trash can and pouring the garbage into the garbage truck at the specified time. (2) The time for dumping garbage is twice a day, the first time from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and the second time from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The cleaners will notify each shop by ringing a bell. (3) Cleaners collecting garbage is their duty. Shops are not allowed to give any bad practices. If anyone extorts money, they can report it to the bureau for investigation. (4) Trash cans are based on the house number. The head of the household is responsible for preparing them for the use of all families in the house. Each house number must have at least one. If there are many households in one house number, more should be added as appropriate. (5) The cost of preparing the trash can is borne by the landlord. If the landlord has no person in charge in Shanghai, the second landlord will pay for it. If the second landlord is not here, the tenant will prepare it. All will be deducted from the rent at the actual price. The same applies when repairing it after damage. If there is any resistance, it can be reported to the bureau for investigation. However, each household should also cherish the use and should not deliberately damage it. If it is damaged within one year from the date of use, the tenant will replace it with a new can, and the cost will be borne by the tenant. (6) Residents along the road should immediately send someone to pour the garbage directly into the garbage truck after hearing the cleaner's bell every day. Residents in the alleys should pour the garbage directly into the truck as soon as the garbage truck enters the alley and hears the bell. (7) All trash cans must have a complete and tight lid. The style is as follows. (8) Households that do not prepare trash cans as required will be punished in accordance with the Administrative Enforcement Law. Yesterday, the style of the trash can was seen to be similar to a cigarette can, about 20 inches high and about 1.5 feet in diameter, made of tinplate.</p>
<h3>French Concession Health Department Announcement Cooperate to Eradicate Mosquitoes Do Not Allow Stagnant Water to Remain</h3>
<p>The Health Department of the French Concession Board of Directors, in order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics and dangerous acute diseases due to the recent hot weather and prolonged drought in the city, in addition to stepping up epidemic prevention work, has also drafted twelve rules for eradicating mosquitoes, printed announcements, and distributed them to residents of the concession. The announcement stated that, in view of the fact that the Health Department staff of the Bureau are unable to fully supervise private gardens due to limited capacity, which results in the breeding of mosquito eggs and harms the public, it is particularly regrettable. It is hereby reiterated that residents of the concession must do their best to fill up stagnant water in various places within the concession and cooperate with the Board of Directors to eliminate the mosquito scourge. It has been found that mosquitoes lay their eggs on calm water surfaces, so the fundamental solution to the mosquito problem can be summarized in one sentence: do not allow stagnant water to remain anywhere. The mosquito control measures formulated by the Bureau's Health Committee are now announced (the articles are omitted). Residents of the concession are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Obstetrician Sued The Plaintiff Disagrees with the Initial Ruling Appeals to the High Court Scheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>Li, the second wife of Shi Bao staff member Shen Wenda, was sent to the Shangxian Hall Women's and Children's Hospital on Saposai Road in the French Concession in May of this year because she was pregnant for a full month. When she was about to give birth, for some unknown reason, the pregnant woman suddenly died. Afterwards, Shen filed a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing the hospital's physicians Ge Chenghui and Zhu Changya of the crime of causing death by negligence. After repeated summons, Judge Xiong Huiping pronounced Ge and Zhu not guilty. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that Shen did not accept the initial trial judgment and submitted evidence to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. The application was approved, and the trial is scheduled for the morning of the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Li Bixia Sues for Divorce Maintenance Payments Have Been Owed for Eight Months And Suffering from Syphilis Makes Cohabitation Unbearable</h3>
<p>Wu Zhenxiang, a Yongbo native and partner in the Shenyuan Money Shop on Ningbo Road, married Li Bixia, a fellow villager, in the 14th year of the Republic through a matchmaker. After the marriage, they initially lived in peace. By the 17th year of the Republic, the two suddenly turned against each other and quarreled at every turn, like fire and water. Either Wu went out and never returned, or Li angrily left on her own. Such a couple could hardly grow old together. Therefore, in July of the year before last, Li filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, alleging that Wu had abandoned her. The court ruled that Wu should pay 60 yuan per month for maintenance. But Wu delayed payment every time. Only after Li applied to the court for enforcement would he be willing to pay. Until recently, Li has been owed for as long as eight months, totaling</p>
<p>480 yuan. And since the days ahead will be long, in order to cut off the kudzu vine, she is suing Wu for divorce, saying that Wu has not only abandoned her, but also suffers from syphilis. The plaintiff has been infected, and cohabitation is truly unbearable. She requests that the divorce be granted. Yesterday morning, the defendant did not appear in court. Lawyer Wang Peiyuan represented him, saying that the syphilis was transmitted by the plaintiff. If a test is desired, both parties should be tested together. The judge then questioned the plaintiff and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Record of the Li Church Praying for Rain</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Li Church Association, due to the current prolonged drought, lack of rain, and the devastation caused by the drought demon, with cracked fields, withered crops, unbearable heat, and rampant epidemics, a combination of man-made and natural disasters rarely seen, although two announcements were made, with each public office leading the masses to set up altars to pray for rain, all done with utmost sincerity, yet without receiving the bountiful descent of sweet rain, thus a general prayer meeting for rain was held, starting at six o'clock yesterday morning. Attendees included leaders Gong Changxi, Jiang Changyong, Wang Yingjun, Yu Shouhuan, Wei Shouquan, You Zhiren, Zhang Qingsheng, Wu Zhan Kui, and other committee members, Pan Chunsen, Wang Dianqing, Zhang Linshu, and more than eighty others. Chairman Zhang Yichen first gave a report, stating that the prolonged drought and extreme heat had become a disaster, and recently Christian and Catholic churches had initiated prayers for rain, and the Li Church could not lag behind. Based on this principle, all leaders were gathered for a three-day general prayer, hoping for abundant rain to save the drought disaster. The order was as follows: (1) The chairman silently expressed prayer; (2) The leaders ascended; (3) Silent prayer for three hours; (4) Ringing the bell to leave the seats, flower offerings; the afternoon and next day's rituals were the same.</p>
<h3>Abundant Watermelon Supply, Selling Price Soars</h3>
<p>The watermelons in this city mostly come from Jiashan, Jiading, Songjiang, Pinghu, Nanxiang, and other places, among which the quality of those produced in Pinghu is the best, being sweet, cool, and palatable. Recently, products from all regions have entered their mature period, and the supply has been particularly abundant, with large quantities being imported every day. The fruit merchants in the Shiliupu and Zhapu Road areas are quite busy. As for the selling price of watermelons, according to news from the fruit industry yesterday, the demand for watermelons from the citizens of this city has exceeded expectations. Although the supply is very abundant, it still does not meet the needs of the market, so the selling price has soared. The high prices are rare in recent years, with the best quality selling for more than seven or eight yuan per dan, and medium quality also around four or five yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreman of Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant Robbed in Broad Daylight, Losing Over Six Hundred Yuan, Robbers Flee Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Sun Jinshao, a local foreman of the Zhabei Hengfeng Road Water and Electricity Plant, has worked at the plant for many years and is highly trusted by the plant. Sun was ordered to ride a bicycle to the Water and Electricity Company on North Sichuan Road at about 2 pm yesterday to collect 615 yuan in cash, intending to distribute wages to the workers at the plant. Unexpectedly, when passing the intersection of Hengfeng Road and Jinling Road, he was suddenly intercepted by four armed robbers speaking with a Jiangbei accent, with ferocious faces, blocking Sun's path, and using violence to prevent him from shouting for help. They searched Sun's chest and robbed all the cash, fleeing in different directions towards East Jinling Road. Upon learning of this, the police at Post No. 18, District 4, of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with Sun Jinshao, reported the robbery to the station chief, Lu Pei. After a brief interrogation, police were dispatched to the scene of the incident to investigate nearby residents. It was said that no alarms had been heard at the time. After reviewing the report, Lu submitted it to the General Bureau and ordered his subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth and facilitate the arrest of the robbers.</p>
<h3>Criminal Dies After Jumping from Train, Qian Ahu Unable to Escape</h3>
<p>At 9:23 am yesterday, the 76th local train from Jiaxing to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was passing through Songjiang Station. Four bailiffs from the Songjiang County Court, including Han Mingzhong, were escorting eight prisoners to Suzhou. Unexpectedly, when the train passed Xin Zhuang and reached the 22-kilometer mark, one of the prisoners, Qian Ahu, suddenly jumped from the train to escape, fatally injuring his head and dying instantly. Zhang Qingyi, the inspector on the train, reported to the stationmaster and dispatched railway police to cooperate with the police from the 5th Branch of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau to take care of and guard the body. At the same time, the local bailiff reported to the court for an autopsy. The Songjiang Court sent a prosecutor to conduct the autopsy at 2 pm. The local bailiff provided a coffin for the burial.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Paper Store Fined for Selling Prohibited Items</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau previously received a letter from the Health Bureau, stating that various large and small tobacco and paper stores in the Nine Mu Di area inside the city were competing to sell Ningbao pills. On the surface, these pills were marketed to treat asthma, phlegm, coughs, general weakness, five strains, seven injuries, impotence, and yin deficiency, but in reality, they contained opium and were addictive (commonly known as quit-smoking pills). These pills initially came from Sichuan, but recently sales in this city have been very high, leading to secret manufacturing. Street peddlers were hired to sell them to various large and small tobacco and paper stores in the Chinese concession. However, the manufacturing location was very secretive, and the stores were told that if they needed goods, they only needed to write a letter and drop it into a certain postal mailbox, and someone would be sent to deliver the goods. Therefore, the organization had not yet been discovered. Bureau Chief Wen had ordered all district offices to notify all tobacco and paper stores not to sell Ningbao pills, but the stores ignored the order. At 7 pm the night before, Shen Zhenhua, the director of the 1st Branch of the 2nd District, secretly dispatched a large team of patrol police to search the Tongchunxiang tobacco and paper store at No. 61 Houjiabang Road and the tobacco and paper store opened by Wu Cichai at No. 458 Fangbang Road. As a result, a total of 19 stores were searched, and 19 shop owners, including Yang Chunquan and Wu Cichai, were arrested. Countless Ningbao pills were seized. After questioning by Director Shen, Yang Chunquan and others confessed that the pills were delivered by street peddlers for resale and that they did not know where they were manufactured, requesting leniency. Because the case involved the sale of prohibited items, a fine of ten yuan was imposed on each of them.</p>
<h3>Strangled Boy's Body Found on Laodoo Road, Russian Child Discovers It in the Bushes</h3>
<p>At around 4:30 pm yesterday, a Russian boy was playing in the wasteland across from the small Western-style house at No. 405 Laodoo Road in the French Concession when he suddenly found the body of a Chinese boy, about twelve or thirteen years old, in the bushes. The Russian boy was terrified and shouted. Nearby residents gathered and saw that the boy's neck was wrapped with a thin rope, and his hands were also tightly bound in front with rope. He was wearing a black-striped short shirt with white stripes, black cloth pants, yellow sneakers, and light gray Western-style socks. His face and limbs were purplish-brown, swarming with flies, and reeking of a foul odor. Judging by the circumstances, it was clear that he had been murdered and then his body had been abandoned there for two or three days. The incident was reported to the police station, and the police chief ordered detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. He then notified the Tongren Fu Yuan funeral home to send a coffin carrier to take the body to the morgue to await examination by the Second Special District Court today.</p>

<h3>Leaders from Various Circles Urge a Quick Resolution to the Labor Strike at the British-American Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>The Dagon Society says that leaders from various circles sent a letter to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating, "Mayor Wu, since the occurrence of the dispute at the British-American Tobacco factory, nearly two months have passed. Although the party and government organs and various parties have made efforts to mediate, it has ultimately been difficult to resolve due to the extreme positions taken by both sides. However, given the hot weather and the suffering of unemployment, it goes without saying that this situation is not beneficial to either labor or management, nor to the local community. We, Shi Liangcai and others, are witnessing the difficult times and have been entrusted by the General Labor Union and various labor groups to write to you, urging you to exercise your authority to quickly resolve the issue. Not only will these thousands of workers benefit, but local security and stability will also rely on it. We respectfully submit this letter and wish you good health. Respectfully, Shi Liangcai, Du Yong, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting."</p>
<h3>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court Advances Summer Office Hours, Starting at 7:00 AM and Ending at Noon</h3>
<p>The heat wave in this city has been increasing in recent days, and it is even more intense during the day. Even when lying down indoors, one cannot stop sweating. According to the regulations, all levels of courts in this city will have summer vacations from July 1st to August 31st. During this period, office hours will be from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. It has now been learned that Shen Jiayi, the president of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and Wang Zhennan, the chief prosecutor of the court, believe that the weather is extremely hot and it is difficult to work near noon. Therefore, it has been decided to slightly change the court's summer work hours, starting from tomorrow (16th), advancing the start time to 7:00 AM and ending at 12:00 noon, so that all the prosecutors and staff of the court can take an extra hour of rest to avoid the sweltering heat. Although the First Special District Local Court, which is under the jurisdiction of the court, is on summer vacation, there are many cases of self-accusation, so the criminal court still hears cases every afternoon except on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Inland River Ships Suspended One After Another Due to Drought and Water Depletion, Suhangjiahu and Su Sheng Services Suspended, Shenhu Service Reduced, Freight Traffic Interrupted, Shipping Companies Suffering Great Losses</h3>
<p>Due to the drought, the inland river water has dried up, and water transportation will be cut off one after another. The ships of various inland river shipping companies in this city that operate in Jiangzhe inland have been mostly suspended, causing alarming losses. The Shenhu service has been changed to a one-way trip from yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Suhangjiahu and Susheng Services Suspended</h3>
<p>The drought and water depletion have affected water navigation. According to news from the China Merchants Inland Navigation Bureau yesterday, the Suhangmei service from Suzhou to Hangzhou, the Jiahu service from Jiaxing to Huzhou, the Suhang service from Suzhou to Hangzhou, the Jiahu service from Jiaxing to Huzhou, and the Suze service from Suzhou to Shengze, have been suspended one after another. Passengers who want to go to the above-mentioned places have been turned away. Ten days ago, the number of tugboats had already been reduced to try to maintain operations, but unexpectedly, there was no rain, and the river water was completely depleted, so it was necessary to suspend services.</p>
<h3>Zhonghu Service Reduced, Extending to Wujiang</h3>
<p>The Shenhu service (from Shanghai to Huzhou) of the China Merchants Inland Navigation Bureau in this city has always been considered the most convenient ship for passengers, and its business has been very prosperous on weekdays. Although the weather is hot and dry, there are still many passengers. After the ship arrives in Huzhou, there are small boats that go directly to the Shiashi of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, which is very convenient for passengers and cargo. However, this time, due to the impact of the drought, travel is inconvenient. It was originally planned to temporarily suspend operations a few days ago, but because there are still many passengers, it is forced to continue operating, but the time has been delayed compared to before. The ship has also been changed to one round trip in the morning from yesterday, ending in Wujiang. Small boats are used from Wujiang to Huzhou, and it has long been impossible to travel from Huzhou to Shiashi.</p>
<h3>Interruption of Freight Traffic, Huge Losses</h3>
<p>As for other places in Jiangzhe inland that can be reached by ship, they are only勉予開駛 [barely managing to operate], and ships will be suspended one after another. Freight traffic has been unable to be loaded, so the price of inland goods (such as melons and vegetables) sold in Shanghai has increased by one-third. The shipping companies are affected by the焦駛 [troubled operations] and cannot load cargo, so the loss of each shipping company is very large.</p>
<h3>The National Products Merchants Association Plans to Organize a National Products Manufacturers Tour Group, With the Aim of Promoting National Products and Promoting Domestic Production, and Has Drafted Regulations to Solicit the Agreement of Various Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association in this city has recently been concerned that the new import tariff rates, which were revised on July 1, have been reduced in many places, and the competition of foreign goods in China will inevitably be greater than before. In order to make the compatriots of the whole country truly purchase domestic products and resist the dumping of foreign goods, the association plans to initiate the organization of a "Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Tour Group" and is now actively engaged in preparations. It is learned that the association has drafted the regulations and measures and will implement them after obtaining the consent of the member manufacturers. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency has recorded the association's draft measures as follows: (1) This group will be organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association to lead domestic product manufacturers. (2) The purpose of this group is to promote domestic products, promote domestic production, let all sectors recognize domestic products, and encourage the public to purchase domestic products. (3) All members and staff of this group must use domestic products to advocate for all sectors. Those who violate this will be subject to suspension from participating in national product activities or a severe warning. (4) Each factory participating in this group must adhere to the resolutions. (5) The location of each factory, unless otherwise specified, will be decided by public lottery, and they must abide by the fair allocation of the committee members of the site affairs. (6) Members must abide by the following disciplines: (1) Be strict with yourself, treat people with sincerity, and be especially friendly to guests. (2) When serving at the meeting place, maintain public order and have appropriate restraint during breaks. (3) Uphold the virtue of friendly persuasion and listen to the guidance of the service staff. (4) Leisure activities must not exceed the scope, so as to preserve personal integrity. (5) All food and clothing must be domestic products, setting an example. (6) Take good care of public property, return it to its original place if moved, and compensate for any damage. (7) Work and rest should be balanced, and游食 [going on excursions while still receiving pay] is beneficial. (8) Be punctual for meetings, abide by the rules of the meeting place, and express opinions in order or in writing. (9) When getting on and off the bus or traveling, follow the order and do not make noise. (10) The time for traveling should also be arranged in steps, a slogan should be formulated, and everyone should shout together. (7) The products sold at the venue must be carefully selected, and the price must be in accordance with the regulations of the Price Evaluation Committee. It is not allowed to raise or lower prices privately, which would damage credibility. (8) In addition to the overall publicity of wall posters, parade advertisements, distribution of leaflets, publication of special issues, and open-air lectures and performances, the individual advertisements and posters of each factory at the venue must not encroach on the position of other factories or designate the position for posting advertisements. (9) All upper and lower staff, factory representatives, and servants shall wear the badges issued by this group to identify themselves. (10) These regulations shall be implemented after being approved by the executive committee.</p>
<h3>National Products Organizations Request a Ban on Foreign Pens and Ink, Requiring Rewriting Documents Written with Foreign Pens and Ink, the Ministries of Education, Interior, and Industry are Currently Drafting Measures</h3>
<p>National product organizations in this city previously stated that the Chinese people are influenced by the European style, not only using imported goods for decorations, but also using imported pens and ink for writing documents, which is considered fashionable. This not only hinders the promotion of domestic pens and ink, but also causes the Chinese culture and national essence to be destroyed. In order to protect the national essence and safeguard domestic products, they have requested the Executive Yuan to order all agencies and organizations across the country to return documents written with foreign pens and ink and require them to be rewritten with domestic pens and ink. It is learned that after receiving the request, the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministries of Education, Interior, and Industry to discuss the measures. They are currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and implementation to emphasize domestic products.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Trafficking Organization Cracked in Xinmin Road</h3>
<p>At 8:30 pm the day before yesterday, Yang Junfeng, a patrol officer from the Wuzhen Road Police Station of the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau, led senior police officers Sun Kezhi and Liu Jianchen to crack down on a red pill trafficking organization at No. 1184 Xinmin Road, seizing two bags of red pills, each bag containing one thousand pills, and twenty-three packages, as well as four blank cloth bags. Three men and women, Qian Baochen, Huang Daihui, and Huang Jingen, were arrested. After being sent to the district office, Qian Baochen and Huang Jingen denied trafficking and smoking red pills, but Huang Daihui admitted to smoking them, saying that the red pills were supplied by her son-in-law and that she did not know where they were manufactured. After the interrogation, the interrogating officer, considering that the case involved drug prohibition, ordered the two bags of red pills and twenty-three packages, together with the four blank cloth bags, to be sent to the Zhabei Branch of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Young Girl Jin Xiao'e Lured to Shanghai and Sold for Price, Detectives Discover Plot Due to Uneven Distribution of Loot</h3>
<p>Jin Xiao'e, a young girl from Yixing, about twenty years old, with a beautiful appearance and slender figure, had long admired the prosperity of the city, but because of the difficult life in her hometown, she was recently lured to Shanghai by Wang Jinzhi, a fellow villager, with sweet words and the promise of introducing her to work in a factory. He hid her in Caojiadu and colluded with Wang Chen, who falsely claimed to be her biological mother, to entrust the matchmaker Lu Chaoqing to sell her to Han Yougen, the owner of the Gonghe bamboo shop at No. 72 Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, for 140 yuan as his wife at about 2 pm yesterday. Just as the payment was being made, a quarrel broke out due to the uneven distribution of the loot. Detective Wukezhong and Dong Wenrui of the Sixth District Criminal Investigation Unit of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who were patrolling in the Bailinan Road area, heard the argument and entered to investigate. They immediately reported to Captain Lu and the district chief of the Sixth District. Together with the post police, they took all the plaintiffs, defendants, and victims to the district office. The perpetrators knew that it was difficult to deceive and confessed to colluding in abducting and selling the young girl and dividing the loot. The district chief, considering that the case involved abduction and sale, which violated the law, ordered that the relevant documents and witnesses be prepared and transferred to the General Bureau for handling in accordance with the law today.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Commits Suicide Due to Poverty, Jiang Ding Dies Under Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>In a booth inside a congee shop next to the Sanguantang in Lujiabang, South Shanghai, Jiang Heshang (a mason) from Shaoxing and his wife, Jiang Ding, lived as tenants. Jiang has had little work recently, and his income has not been enough to cover expenses. He sits in the small room all day, weeping bitterly. Jiang Ding sits in a city of sorrow, her heart burned with worry. All her clothes and other items have long been pawned, and the room is empty. They cannot afford three meals a day, so she had the idea of committing suicide. At about 10 pm the night before, she took advantage of her husband's absence and hanged herself in the room with a belt. When Jiang returned home and discovered it, he tried to rescue her, but it was too late. The incident was discovered by the Yuanchu Police Station of the Second District. Fearing that there was another story, the police summoned Jiang Heshang for questioning and detained him temporarily. Yesterday morning, they ordered the local bailiff Gu Xueyuan from the Fifth Tu to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang was commissioned to go to the scene with an autopsy examiner. After examining and confirming that Jiang Ding had died by hanging, they filled out the form and ordered the family to provide a coffin and burial. It is said that the woman was twenty years old and had only been married for a few months. This time, she sought this shortcut because she could not make a living, which is tragic.</p>

<h3>Yang Hsiu-chiong Arrives in Shanghai ▲ No Performances in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yang Hsiu-chiong, the female swimming star who dominated the Far Eastern Games, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Russia, upon the invitation of the Nanchang New Life Club to participate in the opening ceremony of their new swimming pool. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Welcoming Party</p>
<p>The New Life Club sent special representatives to the Changxing Wharf in Pudong to welcome her. Over ten representatives from the Shanghai Swimming Research Association also greeted her at the customs pier with a large welcoming banner.</p>
<p>▲ Yang's Appearance</p>
<p>Miss Yang looks more robust than before, adding to her healthy beauty. She sported a perm, a light red Western-style dress, flesh-colored short socks, and coffee-colored embroidered leather shoes. After disembarking, she immediately boarded a small passenger boat to cross to the Pudong side.</p>
<p>She then disembarked at the customs pier and proceeded to the New Asia Hotel where she will be staying.</p>
<p>▲ Family Accompaniment</p>
<p>Accompanying Miss Yang this time are her respected parents, as well as her sister, Hsiu-chen, and her younger brother, Chang-hua. Miss Hsiu-chen, 18, two years younger than her sister, is also a skilled swimmer and won at the Far Eastern Games. Chang-hua, only 13, has been swimming for three years and won the Class C championship in a Hong Kong swimming competition last year. The Yang sisters are students at Tsun-tak Girls' College in Hong Kong, and Chang-hua studies at Pui Ching Middle School, where their Chinese and English scores are excellent.</p>
<p>▲ Departure Westward Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Miss Yang and her family originally planned to stay in Shanghai for three or four days, but due to the eagerness in Jiangxi, they have decided to take a boat westward today or tomorrow. As of last night, they had not yet decided which boat to take.</p>
<p>▲ No Performances</p>
<p>According to Miss Yang, she does not plan to perform in Shanghai. She will need to perform once in Beijing before leaving for Jiangxi to participate in the opening ceremony of the New Life Club's swimming pool.</p>
<p>▲ Nanchang Welcomes (Central News Agency, Nanchang, 14th)</p>

Preparations are underway here for a grand welcome. Also, Deng Wenei has been invited to serve as the vice-chairman of the water sports meet.</p>
<p>Yao I-sih Wins Against the Railway Team in the Hsien-fang Cup Yesterday</p>
<h3>Mei-lu Wins Against Yu-kwai</h3>
<p>The fourth Hsien-fang Cup Tennis League continued with its second act yesterday. The excitement has increased, and all team members are in high spirits, making continuous efforts. Hung Hsien-fang, the honorary president of the Shanghai China Tennis Association who donated the cup, made a special visit to the association's secretary, Lu Hsi-wu, yesterday to inquire about the competition, showing great concern. The results of yesterday's games are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Right) Yang Hsiu-chiong posing for a photo at the New Customs Wharf upon arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Left) Misses Yang Hsiu-chiong and Hsiu-chen (Photos by Hsu Tien-chang and Yeh Chang-lieh)</p>
<h3>Mei-lu Wins Against Yu-kwai</h3>
<p>(Eleven to Four) The Hu family team once again achieved a major victory against Yu-kwai, a remarkable feat. The exceptional teamwork of the second doubles pair was outstanding among all teams. Yu-kwai's veteran Feng Hsi-kang also partnered with Ho Tung for the first doubles match, putting up a determined fight. The close competition was evenly matched, and it was praised as the most exciting match of the group.</p>
<h3>Green Light Wins Against Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Nine to Six) Wang Wen-cheng's appearance yesterday in the match against Shanghai added much courage to the Green Light team. However, Hsu Teh-min of Shanghai defeated Chien Wen-pao of Green Light in the second singles match, which was commendable.</p>
<h3>Yao I-sih Wins Against the Railway Team</h3>
<p>(Eight to Seven) The most unexpected result among yesterday's matches was this group. The absence of the two Kuo's (Chi-ta and Peng-nien) from the Railway team was a fatal blow. Yao I-sih's aggressive counterattack was also commendable. It is hoped that the Railway team will not be discouraged, but instead, redouble their efforts, arrive early, and not delay any further, so that success can still be achieved.</p>
<h3>Tung-chi Wins Against Hsia-kuang</h3>
<p>(Ten to Five) The tennis match between the two universities, Tung-chi and Ta-hsia, was characterized by youth and strength. When Tung-chi's Wang Hsu-tung was intensely battling, he suddenly injured his right finger. Despite treatment, he was unable to hold the racket and had to withdraw, which was regrettable.</p>
<h3>Ta-tung Wins Against Chen-kuang</h3>
<p>(Nine to Six) This was another university match, with Ta-tung being Ta-tung University and Chen-kuang being Fudan University. The competition was fierce, and their skills were evenly matched, with Ta-tung having a slight edge.</p>
<h3>Yuan-i Wins Against Chuan-lu</h3>
<p>(Twelve to Three) Yuan-i's victory over the Chuan-lu team yesterday seemed easy, as Chuan-lu's first doubles team was absent and forfeited. It is hoped that similar incidents will not occur again in the future, so as to increase the enjoyment and maintain the spirit of the competition.</p>
<h3>Davis Cup European Zone Final: Australia Leads Against Czechoslovakia ▲ With a Score of Two to One</h3>

One more singles victory will secure their place in the inter-zone final against the United States. The doubles results are as follows:</p>
<p>Crawford/Quist (Australia) defeated Muiriel/Hecht (Czechoslovakia) 6-4, 6-3, 6-</p>
<h3>Qingdao North China Swimming Preliminaries ▲ Strong Winds and Waves Result in Mediocre Records</h3>
<p>(Qingdao, 15th) The preliminary rounds for the 18th North China Swimming Competition, in which this city participated, were held at the Huiquan Bathing Beach on the 15th. Due to strong winds and waves, no outstanding records were achieved. The competition was divided into groups, with no finals held.</p>
<h3>China Sports Association Doubles Tennis Final Not Held ▲ Committee to Convene Today to Discuss Solutions</h3>
<p>In the China Sports Association's Open Singles and Doubles Championships, Chang Ting-chao and Luo Min-o were qualified for the singles final. Chang Ting-chao exerted all his life's strength and, with lightning speed, won three sets in a row, overwhelming Luo Min-o to win the championship, as reported in the previous edition of this newspaper. Yesterday was the scheduled date for the doubles final. Sun Lin-fang arrived at the venue at 5:00 PM and waited anxiously for Lin Pao-hua, who did not appear until dusk. Chu Chiu-cho and Kuan Pei had no opportunity to show their strength, and the match was suspended without an announcement. Yesterday, due to an insufficient number of committee members, a discussion could not be held. An emergency committee meeting will be convened today to discuss the final solution. The trophy is temporarily held by the China Sports Association.</p>

<h3>New Tennis Techniques (6)</h3>
<p>By J. PARMLY PARET</p>
<p>Translated by Chien I-chin and Hung Chun</p>
<p>丨Copyright Reserved. Reproduction Prohibited丨</p>
<p>It is true that some famous tennis players do not focus their eyes on the ball before hitting it, but those who fail in the game because of this are not uncommon. Moreover, the special habits of famous players should never be imitated by beginners. They have undergone a long period of rigorous training and their skills have reached a high level, so they are able to do so. Beginners or players who have not practiced for a long time should absolutely not imitate them.</p>
<p>Those who can take their eyes off the ball before the racket meets the ball must have sufficient training in the racket and hitting action, and also have long experience to estimate the angle, bounce, and trajectory of the incoming ball. They can predict that within a certain period of time, the incoming ball must be suspended in the air within a few inches.</p>
<p>The reason why they take their eyes off the ball is entirely because they want to aim at the opponent. So, when the ball is suspended in the air within a few inches, they shift their eyes to the place they are aiming at. Ordinary players who watch the ball can hit it within a few feet of where they want to hit it, but when a player's skill progresses to the point where they can aim first and then hit the ball within a few inches of where they want to hit it, then weaker opponents will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>When the ball comes towards you, be sure to move aside and do not rush to meet it. If the ball comes straight towards you, move your foot to the left or right depending on whether you are using a forehand or backhand stroke, allowing the ball to fly to the side. Even if you have to move your foot forward or backward at times, do not let your body and the ball's trajectory form a straight line. Beginners often like to meet the ball head-on, which is the worst way to hit it.</p>
<p>When preparing to hit, be sure to let the ball's trajectory go to the left or right. Keep both feet parallel to the ball's trajectory, that is, hit the ball from the side, so that the arm and racket have enough room to swing freely. Therefore, when hitting, always let the ball fly to the side, and then turn the body to deal with it.</p>
<p>Move aside, let the ball fly to the side, then turn your body, lean forward, and use the momentum to make the racket swing freely and powerfully. This is a steady way to hit. If you meet the incoming ball without moving your body aside, then you are too close to the ball, and your body has to lean back, and the hand holding the racket is greatly restricted. Therefore, a famous player who has won championships often says that the reason for his occasional mistakes is because he is too close to the ball.</p>
<p>Moreover, many people with more refined ball skills do not step on a fixed position when hitting properly, but rush to hit. This method, because it uses the momentum of the body, the weight of the whole body is automatically transferred to the racket along with the momentum when hitting, thus increasing a lot of power. This is certainly a great benefit, but this kind of half-running welcome method cannot be done without rich experience. At this time, the ball is flying forward rapidly, and it is necessary to move the body and the racket to deal with it, so it is difficult to calculate the proper speed and the proper position.</p>
<p>Running to meet the ball inevitably leads to the problem of getting too close to the ball. If you are too close, the racket will be restricted, and if you are too far, there is a danger of not reaching it. Therefore, in any case, beginners should always step on a fixed position when hitting, as far as possible. This kind of easy-to-mistake and extremely difficult to be effective running welcome style, can only be considered as beyond reach for the time being.</p>
<p>When both feet are parallel to the ball's trajectory, of course, the left foot moves forward when hitting a forehand, and the right foot moves forward when hitting a backhand. In this way, the arm hitting the ball is extremely free and can be swept forward as much as possible.</p>
<p>The action of sweeping, the player's standing position is completely like playing "golf." Golf players separate their feet and stand facing the ball, so that the ball is in the middle of the feet at an equal distance in front, or closer to the left foot, or closer to the right foot, and then sweep the ball out. Sweeping a tennis ball is the same. Whether the standing position is biased to the left or biased to the right depends on the situation of the incoming ball. When you want to create a long-flying ball by using the momentum, the position of sweeping the incoming ball should be slightly forward. As for intercepting the ball from a low place or cutting the ball from a high place, the position of sweeping the incoming ball should be slightly backward, or slightly in a position closer to the left foot.</p>
<p>However, the best position for sweeping is still when the incoming ball is in the middle of the feet at an equal distance in front. As for dealing with different hitting methods, both feet should stand in different positions. The following chapters will discuss this in detail, but the position in which both feet should stand when sweeping is to stand evenly to the left and right, and this should always be considered the best rule.</p>
<p>If you have accurately predicted the distance of the ball and the height of the bounce in advance, then the position of the footing must be such that the ball happens to bounce up in front of the belt buckle. In this way, the arm has room to swing backward, and at the same time, the forward momentum is not reduced.</p>
<p>In short, keep your eyes on the ball, and when preparing to meet it, quickly stand with both feet in the position you should be on the court. When the incoming ball flies close, the body should move to the side to allow sufficient room for hitting. Do not let the heels touch the ground, bend your knees slightly, and also squat the whole upper body slightly forward. When meeting the incoming ball, both feet should stand in a position parallel to the ball's trajectory, so that the incoming ball happens to bounce up in front of the middle part of the body, and there should be a considerable distance between the body and the ball, so that the body can lean forward when hitting, and use momentum and weight to increase the power of the hit.</p>
<p>Beginners must adhere to all of the above rules before they can actually hit the ball.</p>

<h3>Fisheries Expert Fu Junjun Returns Home After Completing Studies</h3>
<p>Fu Junjun is from Wenchang County, Guangdong Province. In 1928, he went to Japan to study, specializing in fisheries. In 1933, he graduated from the Fisheries Department of Hokkai Teikoku University, achieving excellent results and was often praised by professors at the school. In the same year, he entered the Fisheries Research Department to study the improvement of fishing boats, fishing gear, and fishing methods, the rationalization of fishery company management, and practical acquisition, marine survey methods, Japanese steam trawlers, and hand-drawn nets. His results were also excellent, and he obtained a research certificate from the school. It is said that Fu Junjun is the only one to receive this since the school opened. Now, Fu Junjun has completed his studies and returned to China, intending to engage in practical fishery work with the latest management methods. At a time when the national economy is difficult, there is a lack of fisheries talent, and the fisheries industry is urgently invaded by foreign powers, it is hoped that Fu Junjun's knowledge, technology, and experience will be used to save the situation.

<h3>Private Zijin Primary School Rewards Outstanding Students ▲First and Second Place Graduates Each Year ▲Provide Full Tuition for Junior High School for Three Years</h3>

The school spares no effort in rewarding outstanding students. Students of all grades who excel in both character and academics in the semester exams are exempted from book fees or tuition fees for the next semester. It is recently heard that the principal, in view of the fact that among the graduates of previous years, there are quite a few who have excellent academic performance but cannot continue their studies due to poor family circumstances, has decided that starting from this year, two senior graduates who have academic scores above 90 and excellent conduct will be provided with full tuition for junior high school for three years to show their reward. This measure has been approved by the school board and will be implemented starting this semester.</p>

<h3>My Views on the Savings Bank Law</h3>
<p>— Xie Juzeng</p>
<p>The Savings Bank Law, recently passed by the Legislative Yuan, was promulgated by the National Government on July 4. This law can be said to have taken all aspects into consideration, protecting depositors, supporting rural areas, and encouraging savings. The hard work of the legislators is admirable. However, there are a few points that seem to be open to discussion, and I will try to explain them:</p>
<p>1.  Research on Definitions</p>
<p>Previous drafts of the Savings Bank Law adopted an enumerative approach to the definition of savings banks, which was cumbersome and still prone to omissions. Therefore, the final version adopted a comprehensive approach. Article 1 of this law clearly states that "Any entity that accepts small deposits using the compound interest method is a savings bank." However, what is the definition of "small deposits"? This seems to require further explanation. If we say that amounts less than ten yuan are small, then bookstores and shops that absorb integer deposits of hundreds or five hundred yuan may not be subject to this law in the future. If we consider numbers ranging from one yuan to tens or even hundreds of yuan as small, then the current deposits with passbooks for payment in ordinary banks and money shops will be placed under the supervision of this law. As for the term "compound interest," almost all ordinary deposits are calculated with compound interest; the current deposits of money shops are even compounded monthly. Therefore, the labels "compound interest method" and "small deposits" are insufficient to symbolize savings deposits. Once this law is defined as such, on the one hand, it will not be able to crack down on the abuse of savings business by ordinary stores, and on the other hand, the impact of the law will make ordinary banks and money shops across the country feel like they are stepping on thorns. This is certainly not the original intention of enacting this law.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, true savings deposits mostly belong to individuals, followed by public welfare organizations or cooperatives. As for the inflow and outflow of merchants' funds, except for those depositors who previously used checks, there are very few who have any relationship with savings banks, with the exception of a few small merchants. In the future, this law will not allow the use of checks for current deposits, which will further alienate merchants from savings banks. I believe that if it is clearly stipulated in the implementing regulations that any entity that accepts the surplus funds of individuals, public welfare organizations, or cooperatives using the compound interest method is a savings bank, the definition would be more accurate.</p>
<p>2.  Limitation on Current Deposits</p>
<p>Article 5 of this law stipulates that the total amount of current deposits for each household shall not exceed 40% of the total amount of various deposits. The intention of the legislation is to encourage the acceptance of fixed deposits with longer terms, so that funds can be fully utilized. When market changes occur, it will not trigger a wave of withdrawals. The intention is very profound, but such a rigid regulation will cause great difficulties for savings banks and depositors. As far as banks are concerned, those with branches in various ports will find it difficult to summarize and calculate their accounts. Even without the establishment of branches, or if the accounts of branches are easy to consolidate, the proportion of this deposit will not only be different today and tomorrow, but also change considerably with each deposit and withdrawal during the day. It is extremely difficult to meet the limit stipulated in this law at all times. If they are slightly negligent, they will be subject to the penalties of Article 16 of this law, which will make the bank authorities exhausted. As far as depositors are concerned, the limit for each current deposit account is 5,000 yuan, which they can control themselves. If the bank's receipt of current deposits is not allowed to exceed 40%, they have no way of knowing in advance whether the money in their hands will be rejected by the bank. Fortunately, they can still deposit by contacting the bank by phone. If they bring money to deposit, they may not be able to deposit because another depositor has arrived first, or the limit may only be 111 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen, and they bring 2,000 yuan, the bank will collect a hundred yuan and return 1,888 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen. If theft or loss occurs due to this back-and-forth trouble, the loss suffered by the depositor will be impossible to recover. Even if not, the trouble of the procedure will weaken their ambition to save. This is not the original intention of the legislator to encourage savings. Therefore, I believe that the regulation of this limit is actually not very helpful and is very restrictive. It seems that it is better to find a way to change it. The difficulty in calculating the proportion of the amount of funds invested in Article 8 of this law is the same, and there is room for discussion.</p>
<p>3.  Restrictions on the Purchase of Real Estate</p>
<p>Regarding whether savings banks can purchase real estate, commentators may agree or disagree, and there are considerable reasons for both sides. The special feature of this law is that it focuses on returning funds currently concentrated in cities to rural areas. Therefore, it only allows the acceptance of mortgages on real estate and does not allow the purchase of real estate, so as to avoid the rise of real estate speculation in cities. The intention is not without beauty. However, legislation is originally intended to last for a long time, rather than a doctor prescribing medicine, which is specifically aimed at the current symptoms. According to the savings bank laws of various countries, they are mostly allowed to purchase a considerable percentage of real estate. This is because savings deposits are mostly fixed deposits with longer terms. Before the deposits are due, it seems that they may be appropriately invested in real estate businesses under the principle of risk diversification. Therefore, savings banks may be allowed to invest in real estate with continuous and definite income. However, in order to prevent excessive purchases, which would lead to funds becoming sluggish and fuel real estate speculation, there must be considerable restrictions.</p>
<p>4.  Rural Lending</p>
<p>Article 8 of this law stipulates that loans from savings banks to rural cooperatives and pledges of agricultural products shall not be less than one-fifth of the total amount of deposits. Supporting rural areas can be said to have reached the extreme. It is of great help to the revival of the mainland economy and is the only characteristic of this law. However, as far as we have heard and seen, the organization of rural cooperatives is not yet fully sound. Moreover, only a small number of rural areas have such organizations. It is very difficult to deposit funds in them. As for which agricultural products are used as standards, this still needs to be explained in the implementing regulations. Limiting savings banks to this type of lending to no less than one-fifth of the total amount of deposits is tantamount to giving savings banks a difficult problem. In Shanghai, it is estimated that the total amount of savings deposits in various banks should not be less than 200 million yuan. This means that 40 million yuan must be freed up to engage in this type of lending. I wonder if such a huge amount of money can be mortgaged and lent out in a short period of time. We know that the mainland is in financial exhaustion and rural areas are in urgent need of relief. However, banks and charitable relief societies are different in nature, and lending and disaster relief are different. Savings banks' funds, even half a penny, are all the hard-earned money of depositors. Without a guarantee of safety and a complete plan, it is not appropriate to rashly invest in rural areas. In recent years, although many banks have handled rural loans with remarkable results, the amount is at most only tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. As for the source of funds, most of them are allocated from special public reserves or profits, none of which come from savings funds. This is to prevent damage to the interests of shareholders or depositors when they cannot be recovered. Therefore, we believe that it is possible to stipulate that savings banks' funds should be used for pledges and loans for agricultural products and rural cooperatives. However, if it is necessary to limit them to no less than a certain percentage of the deposits, it is directly using the depositors' hard-earned money as the price for rescuing rural areas. If it is not handled well and the funds are lost, who will be willing to deposit their savings in savings banks in the future?</p>
<p>5.  Limit on Interbank Deposits</p>
<p>Article 8 of this law stipulates that the amount of money that a savings bank deposits in other banks shall not exceed one-fifteenth of its total deposits. According to this law, ordinary banks are allowed to operate savings banks concurrently. In order to prevent the commercial departments of ordinary banks from misappropriating savings funds, strict restrictions have been added, which is indeed appropriate. However, the so-called "depositing in other banks" clearly refers to all counterparts other than this bank. In the banking habits of our country, the nature of these deposits is actually no different from cash. They can be withdrawn at any time when needed. The receiving institution must also have considerable reserves and can repay at any time. They are never misappropriated for long-term investment. As a general rule, interbank deposits are regarded as liquid assets in the same way as cash. Therefore, in order to make savings banks have more liquid assets, the limit on deposits in the commercial departments of this bank may be slightly stricter. As for deposits in other counterparts, there is no need to restrict them too much. (Although the proviso stipulates that government bonds used as collateral are not subject to this restriction, it is ultimately unrealistic and does not conform to banking practices.) Suppose there is a savings bank that has received 3 million yuan in deposits, and the use of its funds is properly allocated in accordance with this law. Then, the amount it deposits in other counterparts is only 200,000 yuan, and the amount it purchases for other banks' accepted bills is only 150,000 yuan (in fact, there are very few bank-accepted bills at present, and purchasing them is even more impossible). With another 200,000 yuan in cash, and on the liabilities side, current deposits account for 1.2 million yuan, once the market suddenly changes and securities plummet, and collateral cannot be re-mortgaged, then the 550,000 yuan in liquid funds will not be enough to meet the withdrawal of half of the current deposit accounts. Therefore, I believe that this kind of inflexible restriction method has room for research.</p>
<p>6.  Responsibility of Important Personnel</p>
<p>Article 15 of this law stipulates that when the property of a savings bank is insufficient to repay the debts of each depositor, the directors and supervisors shall bear joint and several unlimited liability. This is to provide a solid guarantee for depositors and also to promote the directors and supervisors' awareness of the importance of their responsibilities, to do their best to manage affairs, and to live up to the trust of shareholders. Their intention is certainly very good. However, we believe that this law has strict regulations on the use of savings funds. If the directors and supervisors fail to handle their business in accordance with this law, resulting in the bankruptcy of the bank, or the total property is insufficient to meet the debts of depositors, the directors and supervisors are undoubtedly at fault. If they handle the bank's affairs on a daily basis in accordance with this law, and they are diligent and conscientious, but unfortunately the market changes and the collateral falls in price, such as dried cocoons falling from more than 60 yuan to more than 20 yuan, and white rice falling from more than 10 yuan to 5 or 6 yuan, and securities falling to 20% or 30% off during the September 18 Incident, so that the bank cannot sustain it and declares bankruptcy, then the fault is not in the dereliction of duty of the directors and supervisors. It seems unfair to add joint and several unlimited liability to them. Moreover, if there are no regulations in this law on the use of funds, then the directors and supervisors can invest in what they consider to be safe. Then, if the funds are lost, the directors and supervisors will definitely blame themselves for their lack of understanding and be held responsible, which they will also accept. However, if this law adds restrictions and compulsions everywhere, then they are not responsible for anything other than following the law. Therefore, regarding this point, it seems that a considerable revision must also be made in the implementing regulations.</p>
<p>In short, this law is much more complete than the previous Savings Bank Regulations and previous drafts. It can be called a valuable law. It is only because we admire it so much that we dare to contribute our humble opinions in order to eliminate obstacles and promote it without hindrance. The people of the whole country will be protected by it, not only will the savings industry rely on its maintenance.</p>
<h3>Wartime Finance and Excess Profits Tax</h3>
<p>— Chen Honggen</p>
<p>▲ (1) Introduction</p>
<p>'Wartime Finance' broadly refers to a type of political affair during wartime. In detail, it refers to using the government's income and expenditure during wartime as a means to control the society's economy with political power, in order to meet needs and create the greatest welfare for the people of the entire nation. The most important task of wartime finance is to raise military expenses. Military expenses are extraordinary expenditures for the state, so they must be funded with extraordinary income. The methods for raising military expenses are no more than two types: voluntary contributions from the people and government mobilization. The former is purely a matter of voluntary donations, the so-called 'baskets of rice and pots of broth to welcome the king's army.' However, this type of income can only be small, not large; temporary, not long-lasting; and is not the primary method for planning military expenses. Those mobilized by the government are no more than several methods: increasing taxes, issuing banknotes, borrowing money, and exacting donations. Among them, the method of exacting donations, if carried out in a region with a small area and many soldiers, will inevitably lead to 'draining the pond to catch the fish', causing the local economy to frequently verge on bankruptcy. 'Issuing banknotes' makes both the rich and the poor equally bear the war expenses, easily causing the currency value to fall and prices to soar, disrupting society. The remaining two methods of increasing taxes and borrowing money are truly the main sources of war expenses, and most countries adopt them during wartime. Today, China internally has the entrenchment of remnant warlords and communist bandits, with frequent use of troops. Externally, there is the coveting of powerful neighbors, and war can be expected and awaited. In that case, the remedy for wartime finance, will it come from borrowing money, or will it be sought from increasing taxes? The path of increasing taxes was implemented by Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and others during the European war, but its drawbacks are very great. The need for war expenses is urgent, but the matter of levying taxes is slow, so it is difficult to provide relief quickly, that is the first drawback. The people's economic capacity during wartime is low, making it difficult to bear heavy taxes, and after the war, the burden is reduced, creating an imbalance between before and after, that is the second drawback. War cannot be concluded in a day or two; the longer it is delayed, the greater the expense and the heavier the taxes, and the people will inevitably be unable to bear the suffering, that is the third drawback. These are the general drawbacks of increasing taxes during wartime. Now, the most popular excess profits tax during the European war will be analyzed in order to show the path to resolving wartime finance in our country.</p>
<p>(2) Explanation of Excess Profit Tax</p>
<p>The excess profits tax evolved sharply from the wartime profits tax, both being byproducts of the European War. Now, according to the nature of the excess profits tax, it will be explained separately as follows:</p>
<p>Excess Profits Tax as Inheritance Tax 丨 Some classify this type of tax as an inheritance tax. However, examining the legal systems of various countries, whenever economic activity originates from the life of a predecessor, and other individuals can constantly enjoy the property benefits from the event, then the tax levied is considered an inheritance tax. The excess profits tax is actually the result of one's own economic activities. If entrepreneurs do not engage in production, where would profits come from, let alone excess profits? Therefore, the two are truly incomparable.</p>
<p>Excess Profits Tax as Special Donation 丨 The purpose of the excess profits tax is to assist the government with individual financial resources, which is quite similar to special donations. Adams advocated this theory, but upon detailed analysis, it is found that there are also differences between the two. Special donations are levied by public organizations for the sake of the people's happiness, constructing new buildings and requiring huge sums of money, and are levied on the beneficiaries according to the extent of their benefit, based on the principle of special compensation. Now, the excess profits tax is not levied for the benefit of private individuals, the distinction between the two is clear.</p>
<p>Excess Profits Tax as Value-Added Tax 丨 Some say that the reason why profits exceed the standard during wartime is due to the reduction in the supply of goods, the inflation of currency, and changes in social circumstances. Producers' profits are thus increased. From this perspective, the profit tax is a type of value-added tax. This theory is also difficult to perfect. The increase in land value occurs without landowners exerting any effort, and they reap high profits. As for excess profits, they are not entirely unearned.</p>
<p>Excess Profits Tax as Business Tax 丨 Seligman believed that although there are many types of taxes, they can be roughly divided into three major categories: (A) on property or personal income; (B) on individuals or companies; (C) on people or things. Among things, they are further divided into land, capital, and business. The excess profits tax is a type of business tax. Therefore, he said, 'The object of the excess profits tax is the business itself, not the person engaged in the business, just as the property tax in New York has little relationship with its landowners.'</p>
<p>Summarizing the above theories, the last one is the most similar, but we still need to recognize that the object of the excess profits tax is not the total income or net profit of the enterprise, but is limited to its excess profits. Understanding this will prevent falling into the fallacy of generalization.</p>
<p>(3) Background of the Excess Profits Tax</p>
<p>National Expenses are Burdensome 丨 Since the twentieth century, European and American countries have long harbored the intention of war, and have all exerted their efforts to prepare. When war broke out, it was repeatedly delayed, war expenses were vast, and financial resources were naturally lacking. Therefore, they had to urgently take from the people. In addition to the original tax revenue, the government had to seek new sources of income, and thus the excess profits tax emerged.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices 丨 Industrial stagnation, reduced production, and currency inflation are all reasons for the soaring of prices. After Germany was blockaded, only Denmark and Sweden remained as passageways. The goods of these two countries were thus continuously transported to Germany, making huge profits. This was coveted by the government, and it first created the excess profits tax. Within a few months, it became universally popular in various countries.</p>
<p>National Patriotic Zeal 丨 Since ancient times, people have been happy to contribute to righteous armies, as has been seen in historical records. The excess profits tax arose and everyone responded, but at the beginning of its implementation, the people of various countries had not yet heard complaints, and this was the reason.</p>
<p>(4) Theory of the Excess Profits Tax</p>
<p>Sacrifice Theory 丨 The existence of the excess profits tax is not based on the concept of exchange of services between the government and the people. As mentioned earlier, when the country encounters war, all citizens should do their best to help, otherwise once the war is lost, the country will no longer exist, and how can the home be protected? Excess profits are an accidental gain created by the country, so a portion of it should be paid to the government. Therefore, Lloyd George said, 'At a time when the government is experiencing currency inflation and the country's survival is at stake, it is urgently necessary to encourage the people to bravely contribute. We should not find it difficult to increase taxes during wartime and reduce them after the war.'</p>
<p>Equalizing Wealth Theory 丨 The rise in prices during wartime is largely due to the power of society. The total amount of social wealth is not easy to change, and after entrepreneurs reap high profits, they will inevitably squeeze consumers, forming a phenomenon of wealth disparity. Therefore, from a social perspective, this type of excess profits should be taken from private hands and made public to society.</p>
<p>Human Sentiment Theory 丨 War is a trauma for the country, just as an individual suffers from illness and their spirit is destroyed. When a person is ill, they must seek diagnosis and treatment. If they are stimulated, they must be comforted. The relationship between the people and the country is the same. It is not only a matter of friendly assistance, but also concerns the survival of oneself. Therefore, from the standpoint of human sentiment, there should also be an existence of excess profits tax.</p>
<p>(5) Implementation of the Excess Profits Tax</p>
<p>According to J. C. Stamp's investigation, by March 1917, thirteen countries had implemented the excess profits tax, showing its wide implementation. Now, the implementation of the United Kingdom and the United States will be briefly described to give a glimpse.</p>
<p>Scope 丨 After 1914, prices in the United Kingdom soared. In December of the following year, the excess profits tax was formulated, including all excess profits existing within the empire (except for agriculture and the employed class). The United States implemented the federal government excess profits tax in March 1917, including all industries, commerce, and other occupations. After 1918, it was limited to corporate enterprises.</p>
<p>Collection Status 丨</p>
<p>(A) Standard of Profit 丨 This refers to stipulating a certain amount as the standard. All those who exceed it should be levied with excess profits tax. There are three ways to determine this standard:</p>
<p>(甲) Numerical Determination 丨 The United Kingdom took the average value of the enterprise's profit value in any two of the three years before the war as the standard. For example, the average value of 1913 and 1912. The United States stipulated that profits within 3,000 yuan plus 8% of the investment interest rate of the enterprise were tax-free. If it exceeds the above amount, it is an equivalent amount of excess profits tax.</p>
<p>(乙) Tax Rate 丨 That is, the government stipulates a standard enterprise interest rate. For example, the United Kingdom stipulated 6% for companies and 7% or 8% for other business organizations. The United States was 8%.</p>
<p>(B) Tax Rate of Excess Profits Tax 丨 The United Kingdom stipulated that for profits exceeding the stipulated interest rate or profit amount, 40-80% of the excess portion would be levied as excess profits tax. In 1918, the tax rate was determined to be 80%. The United States stipulated that if the excess amount exceeded the above limit but did not exceed 20% of its capital amount, the tax rate was 30%. If the excess amount exceeded 20% of its capital amount, the tax rate was 65%.</p>
<p>(C) Amount of Tax Revenue 丨 After the implementation of the excess profits tax, the total amount actually collected in the United Kingdom reached £1,280,000. In 1917, the total tax revenue of individuals and corporate enterprises in the United States was $1,843,885,505. In 1918, the tax revenue of companies alone reached $2,505,565,939. This was the peak of tax revenue, and it then gradually decreased.</p>
<p>Repeal of the Excess Profits Tax 丨 The United States announced its repeal in December 1911. The United Kingdom also decided to abolish the tax in the same year, given that the peace treaty had been concluded and prices had fallen.</p>
<p>(6) Evaluation of the Excess Profits Tax</p>
<p>At the beginning of the implementation of the excess profits tax, the government advocated it. Scholars then promoted it, and the people were also happy to contribute. Various countries ultimately increased their tax revenue with it, and its contribution was not small. However, the merits of a system cannot be judged by its temporary success or failure. It is necessary to examine in detail whether its theory is sound, whether its principles are appropriate, whether there are obstacles to its implementation, and whether its impact is good or bad. Now, the excess profits tax will be analyzed based on these points.</p>
<p>In Theory</p>
<p>(A) Inappropriateness of Sacrifice Theory 丨 Although the matter of sacrifice is not based on the principle of remuneration, it also cannot be harmful to the bearer. However, the wars of both autocratic and democratic countries are often instigated by a few ambitious people, allowing living beings to be devastated and financial resources to be depleted, none of which are beneficial to the people. In this regard, the sacrifice is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>(B) Inappropriateness of Equalizing Wealth Theory 丨 The rise in prices is indeed largely due to the power of society. However, won't the individual's ability to work and the effectiveness of management ever improve? Now, to consider all excess profits as caused by the power of society, then will the scope of social power be boundless?</p>
<p>Inappropriateness in Principle</p>
<p>(A) Inequality 丨 The excess profits tax allows enterprises that have already expanded or formed high profits before the war, as well as sole proprietorships, to be exempt from tax. The same excess profits are treated unequally, which does not conform to the principle of taxation.</p>
<p>(B) Non-Universality 丨 The excess profits tax only includes profits invested in enterprises, and ignores other income. It is as if the responsibility of war should only be borne by those who obtain excess profits, which violates the principle of universality of taxation.</p>
<p>(C) Uncertainty 丨 The capital amount and profit amount of the excess profits tax are not easy to determine, and the investment interest rate is even more divergent, making it difficult for collectors to take measures.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Implementation</p>
<p>(A) Difficulty in Determining the Standard Interest Rate 丨</p>
<p>Changes in Production Factors 丨 If new capital and labor are added after the start of the war, then the original profit value cannot be used as a calculation standard. New factors must be included in the calculation, but this creates the following difficulties.</p>
<p>Investment Interest Rate is Difficult to Determine 丨 Changes in social circumstances affect the economy, and the old interest rate cannot be applied. To set a new rate, the riskiness of various enterprises during wartime is unequal, making it extremely difficult to be accurate.</p>
<p>(B) Calculation of Investment Amount 丨 Various countries are extremely inconsistent. Some use real estate as the scope, and calculate its profits using the above interest rate. Others include goodwill and copyrights in the calculation.</p>
<p>(C) Tax Evasion 丨 No more than the following methods:</p>
<p>Increase Employee Salaries 丨 This is to conceal a portion of the profits and reduce the tax burden.</p>
<p>Increase Other Expenses.</p>
<p>Increase Advertising Expenses 丨 Its benefit is that on the one hand, it can avoid part of the tax. At the same time, with the influence of advertising, it will be able to obtain sales promotion after the tax is abolished.</p>
<p>Impact of the Excess Profits Tax</p>
<p>(A) Economically</p>
<p>Destroying Small Businesses 丨 Large enterprises hold their abundant capital and vast sales channels, so their set interest rate is lower. The interest rate of small businesses often exceeds the standard interest rate. Now, according to the excess profits tax method, large enterprises can be spared, while small businesses, with no profit to be made, will inevitably decline.</p>
<p>Harming Enterprises with Greater Risk 丨 Enterprises with greater risk set a particularly high investment interest rate due to the uncertainty of returns, in order to compensate for periods of loss. The excess profits tax only recognizes its high-profit period unilaterally, which is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Reducing Investment and Capital Accumulation 丨 Entrepreneurs will collectively withdraw their capital because taxes are heavy and there are no high profits to be made.</p>
<p>(B) Socially</p>
<p>Impact on the Standard of Living 丨 After suffering the loss of taxation, entrepreneurs will seek ways to compensate. Entrepreneurs in patent industries can still maintain their original prices. (Patented items should not be increased in price.) But ordinary producers will pass it on to consumers, thereby reducing the social consumption capacity and standard of living.</p>
<p>Impact on Social Welfare 丨 When the excess profits tax is prevalent, entrepreneurs often halt or reduce their businesses to wait for the tax rate to be reduced or abolished. In this way, all market activities suddenly become deserted and people's enjoyment is sharply reduced.</p>
<p>(7) Conclusion</p>
<p>The excess profits tax originated from the financial difficulties of wartime finance, but its inadequacy as a good tax system has been described above. In my opinion, the most appropriate strategy for urgently helping wartime finance is borrowing money. Borrowing money can comprehensively plan a large amount of funds to meet the needs of large military expenses, which is the first benefit. The repayment of loans is after the war, after the society's economic capacity has recovered, allowing the people to bear the cost of the war, so they do not feel the suffering, which is the second benefit. The target of borrowing money is the rich, and their loans are speculative in nature, so they do not affect the economic situation of the general public, which is the third benefit. War expenses come from borrowing money, so they do not encroach on regular expenses, and there is no fear of stagnation in various administrative and business affairs, which is the fourth benefit. With these four benefits, what is the way to resolve wartime finance other than borrowing money?</p>
<h3>Commercial News Financial Market Listless and Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual. Only money shops were doing some isolated transactions, so the market was even more listless and declining. The settlement aspect was completely in a state of standstill, leading to an even more decadent atmosphere. The foreign exchange swap market opened at four percent in the morning, one point weaker than the previous day's market. The afternoon market was the same, with no hope of recovery. The trading of swap notes was also relatively quiet. It is estimated that the morning market transferred over 2.5 million, with over 200,000 in new transactions. The afternoon market traded over 100,000, and the small general assembly traded over 300,000. Foreign exchange loan transactions only had over 300,000 in redemptions, with no news of new transactions. The collection and settlement of foreign currency public bonds by money houses was over 21.1 million. The exchange of funds from various regions was also only over 200,000. The auxiliary currency market was also uniformly quiet. Jiangnan small coins opened at 834 yuan in the morning and changed to 833 yuan in the afternoon. The result was a small change of two yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 3,000 jiao in the morning and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins opened at 727 yuan and changed to 726.7 yuan in the afternoon. The result was also a small change of two jiao compared to the previous day. Copper coins also contracted by 500 wen to 333,000 wen. The trading price was 7,700 foreign currency, totaling 25,641 strings of wen.</p>

<h3>Securities Last Week's Public Debt Fluctuations Were Significant ▲96 Rose and Fell Wildly, Both Hitting Limit Down ▲Trading Was Very Active, Nearly 150 Million</h3>
<p>From July 9th to 14th last week, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly. The intensity of the surge was close to reaching its peak. The 96 public bonds were particularly special, rising wildly to the limit up within two days. The black market further rose by one or two yuan. The wild fall reached limit down. Those seeking to sell felt even more uneasy, going back and forth, completely manipulated by speculators. Initially, the bond market did not have a linked relationship. The current bond environment is actually in an unusually solid position. Although it is an abnormal development, it is not without reason. Now, the most prominent reasons for its rise will be listed below for reference. "National Large Organizations" have been exchanging opinions and abandoning prejudices for months, with messengers going back and forth between the central government and the southwest, realizing unity. It is generally believed that the future of the country is promising, and they have deep faith in public bonds, making large purchases. In addition, the results of suppressing bandits are extremely significant. The bandits are extremely poor and will soon be cleared. The biggest reason is still (1) financial sector absorption. The abundant floating capital in Shanghai banks is an undeniable fact. Therefore, the purchase of public bonds is more enthusiastic than at any other time. After the Ministry of Finance strictly investigated the savings department deposits and their contents of the various banks, it was stricter than before, implementing the fixed rule of purchasing bonds with 40% of the cash. The demand of various banks suddenly increased, and there was a shortage of bond chips.</p>
<p>(2) The rumors of reorganizing the 96. Since the suspension of principal and interest payments on the 96 public bonds, during the Angell custody period, there was an agreement on surplus guarantee. Since the national government has been depositing 5 million yuan of customs duties every year to prepare for the reorganization of domestic and foreign debts, it has also been several years. Now that the new customs duty rate is implemented, the authorities have talked about reorganizing domestic and foreign debts. As a result, speculation on the 96 bonds has become extremely heated.</p>
<p>The above points are the most prominent reasons for the public debt rise. Other things, such as the central government gradually recovering the public debt mortgages from various banks and the enthusiastic investment of JianShe Silver Company, are minor matters. Now, the process of last week will be briefly described below. On Monday, due to the widespread rumors of reorganizing the 96, the eagerness of various factions to enter the market was even greater than before. Although the various debt markets were at their peak, buyers were not afraid at all, and market prices soared. The unified salt tax was about to approach 80%. The 96 actually rose wildly to the limit up, selling at a maximum price of 19.5 yuan. The black market still rose by two yuan. However, due to the large number of speculators, it triggered a reaction on Tuesday. The 96 fell sharply to the limit down this month. It rose sharply and retreated quickly. Although the speculators can be done and cannot be done, this trend affected other bonds slightly. On Wednesday, various factions shorted more and more, and market prices fell by several jiao to one yuan and three or four jiao. The 96 was slightly better, rising five or six jiao. On Thursday, due to the special demand for the number 4, although shorters were still enthusiastic, demand still exceeded supply, and market prices recovered by several jiao to one yuan. On Friday, only the 96 fell slightly by eight or nine jiao. The others continued to improve by several jiao to one yuan. On Saturday, there were still many sales, recovering slightly by about one yuan. As a result of the week, the compilation, disbandment, and gold long were slightly better by several jiao. The rest were slightly better by a few jiao to over two yuan. However, the shorters have been extremely enthusiastic this week, because they believe that the market price is already high, and that another rise is limited, and the danger is already very slight. However, the number of accounts is still over 70 million yuan. There are only eight days left for this month's trading. The rollover and infighting between the bulls and bears must be particularly fierce. The 96 type, because speculators have gradually withdrawn, may be slightly on the right track thereafter. The total transaction volume for the week was 148,564,400 yuan. Now, the results of its rise and fall will be listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Quiet</h3>
<p>A report from the New Fung foreign firm states that yesterday, the 14th, the New York stock market was quiet, and prices were quite stagnant. The characteristic of the market was the strength of silver and sugar stocks. The former was like US Smelting, and the latter was like American Sugar Refining. Judging from the situation, silver and sugar both benefited the bullish side. Traders did not care about the poor predictions of railway income. Only 190,000 shares were traded in half a day. Furthermore, according to an agent's report, the securities market was calm, and price fluctuations were meaningless. The Shi Jia Zhuang crop report (wheat) was released, which was beneficial to the bullish side. Profit-taking was absorbed by new bulls, and although there would be a reaction, it would be a good opportunity to buy. (Cotton) loosened due to profit-taking by the bulls, rainfall on the Texas coast, and low consumption figures, but the market did not show weakness. The demand for cotton cloth has shown considerable improvement. The common opinion of all parties is bullish. The total consumption in June was 363,414 bales. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower US Cotton Reversal and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm due to unfavorable weather and smooth cloth market, but later softened due to reversal selling. As a result, spot prices fell 10 points. Futures fell between 3 and 10 points. English cotton futures rose 8-9 points. Indian cotton rose first due to speculative buying, then weakened due to selling by European exporters. As a result, Pinggu'er rose half a rupee, Aomula rose 4 rupees and 2.5 angles, and Bairoxi rose 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 14th):</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Falls One or Two Angles After Price Limits</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were particularly scarce, only 14 or 15 (a total of 2,450 shi). However, the market situation was slightly discouraged due to the price limit set by the Municipal Social Bureau. Although the drought continued and the sources became even scarcer, the outbound routes turned stagnant, and the situation was very quiet. The market prices for Changbang Su, Tongnan Port and other japonica rice, as well as Qingjiao Song, Si, Xi, Lian and other late rice, fell by one or two angles. Only Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan were able to stabilize the situation.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the sources from the He Xia gangs were 11 or 12. The outbound routes for various goods in the market turned sluggish. The price of Bai Yuan increased by about two angles. Bai Jing, Bao Dao and He Ping were stable, and the remaining goods were also settled.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Dutch White Arrived at Over 10,000 Bags Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The guild's board meeting quoted 24 coarse gauze white spot prices, but the original board did not succeed. The approximate price was 19 yuan and 9 jiao. The price of the goods from this firm was 20 yuan and 0.05 fen, a slight decrease of half a jiao compared to the previous day. More than 10,000 bags of Dutch white arrived from the Netherlands on the Dutch ship yesterday. Taikoo B mark was 20 yuan and 4 jiao. The goods of the No. 1 white from this factory were lacking at 19 yuan. More than 100 bags of Chaoqing were offered, with Huanggangqing at 13 yuan and Longgangqing at 12 yuan and 5 jiao. A small amount of Chen Zhi red was offered, with a price of 13 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Metals and General Merchandise Lead Still, Awaiting Movement</h3>
<p>Sales of general merchandise and lead have been stagnant for a long time. Yesterday, there was a sudden transaction from the Tianjin gang. There were also some orders from Fujian, Guangdong, Shantou and other routes. Although paint companies and yellow lead factories also had intentions to purchase, the market price was estimated at 10 yuan and 2.5 jiao per dan (market dan), which was 2.5 jiao higher than before. It is reported that more than 370 or 80 strips were offered yesterday.</p>
<p>There is a large shortage of 24-gauge thick tinplate in the market, and the market price is 2 jiao and 1.2 fen per pound. Ice factories, printing houses, and tinplate workshops in this street have all purchased it, but the underlying goods are extremely scarce, and buyers often sigh in vain.</p>

<h3>Children's Literature</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>It is said that this year is the year of children's happiness, but after more than half a year, children are not seen to be much happier than before. Perhaps, in some places, they will be even less happy.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, I heard that last winter, many children were frozen to death. The number of unemployed and out-of-school children is not even counted. In the mainland, this year's drought and floods have further fueled the bankruptcy of Chinese society under the encroachment of the great powers. Naturally, the misfortune of children is bound to develop day by day.</p>
<p>The happiness of children cannot be created by a few empty words. A fundamental solution for the people is out of the question now. Now, we should educate and cultivate children so that they can embark on the path of seeking happiness for themselves.</p>
<p>Now, church schools are still using God to anesthetize children. There are very few good elementary school textbooks. And, there are not enough reading materials for elementary school students. Even children in better environments are constantly subjected to invisible abuse, and are gradually deteriorating under unreasonable cultivation. Not to mention the children of the poor.</p>
<p>Popularizing children's education is necessary. Popularizing children's literature is necessary. It is necessary to create children's literature that meets the needs of children, and to popularize it. It is necessary to lead children to create their own literature.</p>
<p>New children need new literature. However, new children's literature should not be medieval animal stories, or idealized aesthetic ballads. In the current stage of China, we do not want things that blind children's eyes. Promoting children's self-awareness, adding to children's scientific knowledge, and opening children's eyes to recognize society and their own position are the tasks that children's literature artists should fulfill. Therefore, realistic children's literature is what needs to be created urgently.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use realistic themes to create new children's literature. New fairy tales and new nursery rhymes should all have a realistic nature. From the facts of imperialism oppressing China, "January 28th," and the tragic lives of the people in the Northeast in recent years, we can all draw new themes for children's literature. And, using those themes with direct realism to produce new children's literature works can greatly educate Chinese children.</p>
<p>The language of new children's literature, of course, should be the mass language of children (the mass language of children), and should not be the language of a minority of children. New nursery rhymes and songs must be loved and sung by the broad masses of children. However, the author must also lead the majority of children to move towards creating a new scientific language. It is not enough to stay in the existing state of children's language without moving it forward.</p>
<p>It is reported that Japan sent the nursery rhyme poet Noguchi Ujo to "Manchukuo." It is said that he has an important literary and artistic mission. However, shouldn't the fact that the empire uses its own nursery rhyme poet to anesthetize children prompt us to reflect? We need to have our new children's literature artists, with the liberation of the Chinese people as their basic task.</p>
<h3>Southern Journey Notes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>At the end of Chang Lake, there is a winding remnant of the Yandang Mountains. The small mountain city is built in a gap in the mountains. Many buildings in the north city can be seen from afar. The arched stone bridge with stone railings is like a gate, spanning the end of Chang Lake. The left and right sides of the bridge are very symmetrical. The banyan trees are opposite each other, and the shapes of the two mountains behind them are also not far apart. Crossing the bridge is the lake pavilion. I am already in my hometown that I have dreamed of for years.</p>
<p>Many new things have appeared within four years. Long-distance calls have reached this extremely remote county. Telegraph bureaus and even radio bureaus have also been established due to the Fujian Incident. The automobile road can be built by the end of the year, and now the officials are extorting and forcibly assigning road donations. Yandang Mountain is about to become a scenic area, attracting tourists from big cities for sightseeing. The emblems of the New Life Movement are posted everywhere, somewhat like the blue eagle badges in the United States. The streets seem to be cleaner than before, and the people are poorer than before.</p>
<p>The social order is still so unstable. On the day I arrived home, I heard the news that a rich peasant had been kidnapped and harmed. About a thousand acres of farmland is considered the ultimate rich man. Discharged soldiers and scattered Red Party members seem to have some organization. The 19th Route Army troops that were scattered in Fujian ran over in groups of three or five, asking for travel expenses from each household. Refugees from Jiangxi and scattered Hunan natives come and go endlessly. Sometimes they collect money together with the staff of the Public Security Bureau, and sometimes they use high-pressure methods to extort from the people. The people have been extorted so much that they gradually no longer find it strange. Beggars and vagrants blackened by opium will sit in your doorway and refuse to leave, insisting on a certain amount of money; it is said that even the government is afraid of them.</p>
<p>University graduates have nothing to do at home, and middle school graduates have no way out because there are not enough elementary school teacher positions. The rich smoke opium at home, and the poor also pretend to be romantic, smoking opium to pretend to be decadent. It is said that many writers have also smoked opium. In the conversation, nineteen is dissatisfied with the status quo, scolding the government for selling the country and exploiting the people. However, if they were to be the authorities, I am afraid that they would sell the country even more severely and exploit even more viciously. Those honest rich families are worried about kidnapping day and night. People in the countryside move to the city, and people in the city want to live in Shanghai or Hangzhou. The rich are gradually leaving, and the poor are still doing evil in the local area. I don't believe that there are many pure people in this society.</p>
<p>The prices of agricultural products have fallen sharply, and the harvest of fishermen has been particularly hit hard. Cash is gradually drying up in the market. Those shops with more exquisite decorations look impressive on the surface, but they are actually opening at a loss. People's purchasing power is extremely weak. Everyone considers it a luxury to buy one and a half catties of yellow croaker for one small dollar. Heavy taxes turn small poverty into great poverty. The county magistrate went door-to-door to solicit road donations. Those with several thousand yuan of property had to pay one hundred yuan. The people scolded the government for kidnapping, and the government scolded the people for not knowing the importance of construction.</p>
<p>This small city, judging from the various counties accustomed to war and banditry, should be a paradise. For more than ten years, it has not suffered any major floods or droughts. Although it once suffered from banditry and was once attacked by Red bandits, it did not suffer much loss. However, the fate of Chinese people is the same everywhere. The economic tide does not distinguish between county boundaries and provincial boundaries. The government, like the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is not unwilling to do some work, but the people's ability to bear is so weak. How can they understand the government and how can they forgive them for forcibly burdening them when they cannot escape from poverty. Economics must have a plan, and there should be a whole plan. One-sided development can easily become a partial disease. It is difficult to see results by using rickshaw pullers to pull trains.</p>
<p>The sound of rickshaw bells sent me to my home. I seemed to be dreaming. I was afraid that I was still dreaming. When my parents and sisters saw me, I really didn't know what to say first. Unfortunately, the school of the three younger sisters has not ended, and our family of seven cannot reunite. The youngest sister graduated in the first month, and she has been waiting for my return at home for half a year. She said that she had prepared zongzi and could spend the Dragon Boat Festival at home this year.</p>

<h3>Parent's Heart</h3>
<p>— Lü Shaoguang</p>
<p>Mother sat on a stool,</p>
<p>Knitting a woolen sweater for her sister;</p>
<p>The younger brother in the cradle,</p>
<p>Babbled as he learned to speak;</p>
<p>The compassionate mother's heart suddenly doubted: Could it be that this whole life is all for my children?</p>
<p>The poor father,</p>
<p>With a worried face, weakly</p>
<p>Paced back and forth in the courtyard,</p>
<p>Worry revealed from his eyes:</p>
<p>The children are growing up day by day,</p>
<p>What will become of them in the future?</p>
<h3>Talking About Malay Cities (Continued)</h3>
<p>Penang Island</p>
<p>Penang Island, although in essence it is the same as Singapore, its face is beautiful.</p>
<p>Penang Island is a paradise on earth. Penang Island deeply hides the sins of the world.</p>
<p>Penang Island has beautiful scenery (see my humble work "Beautiful Island of the South"). However, the "paradise" of Penang Island is prepared for future human beings to enjoy. Penang Island is painting gray on green, and the light of Penang Island is wrapped in darkness.</p>
<h3>Malacca</h3>
<p>Malacca faces the Strait of Malacca. It has dirty streets and dilapidated historical sites.</p>
<p>You can see the ruins of the past British and Dutch rivalry from Malacca; you can imagine how fierce the colonial battles were from the ruins of Malacca Castle. And now, the goal of this competition has been shifted (is it turning to China?), and the weapons are also changing with each passing day.</p>
<p>Malacca is rich in fishing boats. On the sea of Malacca, you can see sails constantly fluttering on the turbulent sea.</p>
<p>It is said that the Chinese in Malacca are the most Malayized, which is the opposite of the overseas Chinese in Penang Island. Many of them cannot speak Chinese; they eat with their hands; they recognize London as their "ancestral home"; they do not know where China is. This may be because the history of Chinese colonization here is longer? Recently, I heard that due to the efforts of overseas Chinese, the situation has improved somewhat.</p>
<p>Malacca has now declined in history. It has lost its past glory, and it has gradually become less valued. History is changing, and the land and people cannot but change with it!</p>
<p>Ipoh</p>
<p>Ipoh, a city in a tin mining area. Belongs to Perak.</p>
<p>It is not a big city. However, when the prices of tin and rubber rise and fall in the European and American markets, the manipulated puppets of the world have staged tragedies and comedies here.</p>
<p>The transportation is considered to be vital: in the west, the Federal Railway can lead to the border of Siam, in the northeast, the railway of the Malay Federation leads directly to Penang Island, and in the south, it reaches the representative of the British Emperor, the Governor of the colony, Singapore via Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Ipoh has strange caves. Taiping Lake in nearby Taiping is also very famous.</p>
<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>A Wall (5)</h3>
<p>— Original by Roberto Bracco, Translated by Xi Dichén</p>
<p>"Is it done?" the man asked in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The youth spread his arms in despair and replied, "It's not done."</p>
<p>"You're joking!"</p>
<p>"It's really not done."</p>
<p>"What? This won't do! This won't do!" The man fell into a chair, and stretched out a pair of dirty hands like claws from under his coat, while the pupils of his slightly blue eyes became larger under his red and disheveled eyebrows.</p>
<p>"This won't do!" he continued. "The newspaper should have come out long ago. If the newspaper comes out without an article attacking Raffael Borgagni, I'm finished. Ah! Why didn't I know how to write myself? Poor me! I harmed myself! Today is the critical moment of this fierce election competition. I should have gotten the money, but now I'm going to... I'm going to get beaten, they're going to say I'm a liar... a friend-seller. You're the friend-seller... you're the one... you're the one..."</p>
<p>"Don't be like this, Don Cinnarino, please calm down! ...I'm not selling friends, I really don't know how to write this promised draft. I've always thought that Raffael Borgagni himself is not bad, I believe he is a good person. But I still have the will to complete my work, slander him, destroy him, and frame him. But while conceiving and drafting absurd charges, I can't find a single idea. I can't even spell... I can't even string together the letters that make up a word."</p>
<p>"Go ask someone else, don't retail your conscience's hesitation to me! You're a born defamer, we know you!"</p>
<p>"I'm a born defamer? Yes, I have to answer you yes!"</p>
<p>As he said this, the young man coughed with a sad and self-pitying tone, while the man began to lament and pity himself again:</p>
<p>"Ah, the newspaper! The newspaper! What am I going to do? Poor me! Poor me! What a disgrace! What a dishonorable thing! This is how you repay me for giving you work, giving you money to live on. This is your gratitude. Friend-seller! Assassin! I swear, if I ever give you another chance to earn half a penny, spit in my face. You can start starving from today, and if you go begging, you might not find anyone who will give you anything! Ah, poor me! They're going to beat me! They're going to say I'm a liar, say I'm a name worse than a liar. I've already said the words. What humiliation! What misfortune! Begging, that's right,... now, go begging, ask people to do a good deed! You can have hope!"</p>

<p>Shen Bao Medical Weekly</p>
<h3>Typhoid Fever Discussion Three (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Ke's "Surface Theory" states: "The area above the waist is the surface of the three yang. The three yang govern the exterior and are rooted in the interior. The heart is the land where the three yang meet. The interior is from the heart and chest, and the exterior is from the crown of the head. The front reaches the forehead, the back reaches the shoulders. The lower reaches the feet. The interior combines with the bladder. This is the surface of the Taiyang. … The interior is from the heart and chest to the stomach and intestines. The exterior is from the head to the face and abdomen. The lower reaches the feet. This is the surface of the Yangming. From the throat of the heart, the exit is the like. The upper ears and eyes. Slanting to the top of the head. The exterior reaches the ribs. The interior belongs to the gall bladder. This is the surface of the Shaoyang. … The area below the waist is the surface of the three yin. The three yin govern the interior and do not reach the exterior. The abdomen is the land where the three yin meet. From the abdomen, through the spleen and the two intestines, to the anus, is the surface of the Taiyin. From the abdomen to the two kidneys and the bladder urinary tract is the surface of the Shaoyin. From the abdomen, through the liver, above the diaphragm, to the heart. From the ribs down to the small intestine and Zongjin is the surface of the Jueyin." Judging from these words, it is said that the area above the waist is the surface of the three yang. And yet it is also said that the surface of the Taiyang and Yangming reaches the feet. This is self-contradictory. His regarding the exit cheeks upper ears and eyes to the top of the head as the surface of the Shaoyang is precisely the Ling Shu Jing Luo chapter's statement that the gallbladder foot Shaoyang meridian originates at the outer canthus, ascends to the corner of the head, descends behind the ear, and descends to the cheek carriage. His regarding the ascent from the liver above the diaphragm to the heart. From the ribs down to the small intestine and Zongjin as the surface of the Jueyin, is precisely the Jing Mai chapter's stomach foot Jueyin meridian, which passes through the genitals, penetrates the diaphragm and spreads through the ribs, and its branch separates from the liver and penetrates the diaphragm. In that case, where is Ke's so-called surface of the six meridians not the meridian of the Jing Luo? Truly so-called</p>
<p>Holding it for no reason, and measuring it unable to form logic.</p>
<p>Ke also said: "The heart is the master of the six meridians, therefore all six meridians have symptoms of heart vexation." He also said, "Heart vexation, heart trembling, vexation in the heart, all empty vexation, all belong to Yangming, because the heart resides on the Yangming surface." He also said, "Now typhoid scholars all regard the bladder as Taiyang, therefore there is the error of transmission to the foot but not to the hand, not knowing that Zhongjing's book only follows the great law of yin and yang, and does not adhere to the meridians of yin and yang. … Zhongjing regarded the heart as Taiyang, therefore he was able to externally unify the qi and blood of the body, and internally conduct the meridians of the five viscera and six fu." Judging from these kinds of arguments, Ke regarded the heart as Taiyang, and also said that the heart is the master of the six meridians. He also thought that the heart resided on the surface of Yangming. Indecisive, self-contradictory. His tree is not firm, his theory has no master, and his absurdity is very clear. How can it be left unaddressed?</p>
<p>In general, since Wang Shuhe, Cheng Wuji, and Zhu Fengyi, the typhoid six meridians have all been based on the Jing Luo. And the meaning of Yangming and Jueyin is not in accordance with the Inner Classic. Fang Zhongxing rose up and changed it to the exterior and interior of the body layers, using the exterior to interior to explain the three yang, and using the bottom to top to explain the three yin. Wei Litong echoed it and further embellished it with the theory of the five elements. But it is still incomprehensible. As for Ke Yunbo, he changed it again to the theory of surfaces. But he still hesitated between the Jing Luo, regarded the heart as Taiyang, and refuted the statement that the foot bladder meridian is Taiyang. But he was unable to solidify his own statement. In addition, there are those who speak of transmitting through the meridians or say it does not transmit. Some say it transmits again, like Cheng Wuji. Some say it no longer transmits, like Min Zhiqing. (See Wei Litong's "Original Meaning of the Shang Han Lun") Some count the number of days. The Taiyang receives it on the first day, the Yangming receives it on the second day, and so on. Some say that it cannot be restricted by the number of days. (Min Zhiqing) And there are also names such as following the meridian to transmit, crossing the meridian to transmit, mistakenly transmitting downwards, and following the meridian to obtain degree to transmit. (Li Dongyuan) All of these are unable to break the net of the six meridians, and thus make excuses for it.</p>
<p>Now, the falsehood of the Jing Luo is known by everyone. The theory of yin and yang and the five elements is even more unnecessary to discuss. The statement of body layers is also a fantasy. Now those who perform subcutaneous injections can spread the medicinal power throughout the body in no time at all. How can it wait one or two days to begin transmitting to the interior? From this, one can clearly see the non-truth of the body layer theory. The surface theory is unfounded. Searching for it in ancient teachings, there is nothing to rely on. Examining it with real objects, there is also nothing to verify. Its talk is based on conjecture. Without even refuting it, its falsehood can be known. Therefore, I say. The most meaningless thing in the Treatise on Cold Damage is the theory of the six meridians. The theory of the six meridians is broken, and the so-called six meridian divisions and the theory of six meridian sequential transmission will also disappear along with it. Only then can the entanglements and chaos of the Treatise on Cold Damage be cleared up in one fell swoop. Only in this way can we talk about the Treatise on Cold Damage. Only then can we talk about infectious diseases.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Evils of Treating Illness via Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>I have previously written in this publication discussing the pros and cons of treating illness via correspondence. My opinion was that without a personal examination, accurate diagnoses and prescriptions are impossible. To provide treatment advice based solely on a letter from the patient is fraught with untold dangers. However, some points were not fully addressed at the time, and I will now elaborate on them separately:</p>
<p>(1) The Nature of Questions Varies – Can All Be Answered? Medical specialties are diverse, each with its own expertise. It is impossible for one person to be proficient in all fields. The illnesses inquired about through correspondence are extremely varied. If the responder adopts an attitude of "knowing what one knows, and admitting what one doesn't," it will erode the patient's faith. On the other hand, if they pretend to know what they don't and offer vague and generalized answers, they cannot escape the condemnation of their conscience. Therefore, regardless of the responder's level of knowledge, treating illness via correspondence is simply beyond the capabilities of one person. This is the first point.</p>
<p>(2) Doesn't Signing One's Name Below the Headline Attract Patients? Medicine is a benevolent art, as has been clearly stated since ancient times. Responding to illnesses via correspondence seems like a benevolent act, using precious time to save people. However, there is the argument that one should judge based on intention. If one's name is signed below the headline, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion of attracting patients. Patients who are not satisfied with the response are likely to seek in-person consultation. How can one clear oneself of this suspicion in the eyes of the public? This is the second point.</p>
<p>(3) Doesn't Recommending Foreign Medicines Create the Suspicion of Advertising for Foreign Merchants? The dumping of foreign medicines increases year by year. Upon closer examination, their methods often involve leveraging Chinese doctors for promotion. Some medical supplements in newspapers seem specifically designed to promote foreign medicines. The medicines listed in their responses are almost exclusively products of certain foreign firms. Such behavior, acting as accomplices to evil, is beneath contempt and not worth criticizing! This is the third point.</p>
<p>In summary, these three points are offered as a supplement to my previous article. In short, the benefits of treating illness via correspondence are minimal, while the harms are enormous. To maintain the dignity of the medical profession and to avoid endangering patients, the city's medical association recently decided to decisively remove the medical consultant column from its publications. It is hoped that other newspapers will follow suit.</p>
<h3>Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(6) Eye Protection in Summer</p>
<p>These days, everyone is complaining about the "heat" which causes heatstroke and gastroenteritis, which are therefore numerous. As a result, epidemic hospitals often display "full" signs. Those who value hygiene have already declared martial law, implementing measures such as cholera vaccinations, a diet rich in vegetables and light on meats, and the elimination of flies and mosquitoes. These are all things that should be done in the summer. However, eye hygiene is often overlooked, leaving something to be desired. I will now discuss a few points that deserve attention.</p>
<p>1. When the sun is strong and the light is intense, it is best not to overuse your eyes. The eye's regulatory functions are easily fatigued, leading to congestion.</p>
<p>2. When going out in strong sunlight, wear tinted glasses (dark yellow or smoky crystal). This can prevent your eyes from being exposed to strong light stimuli and indirectly prevent conjunctival diseases caused by light stimuli.</p>
<p>3. In the evenings, whether reading or writing, electric lights should not be too bright. Using colored light bulbs is better to avoid strong light irritating the eyes.</p>
<p>4. When sweating a lot in the summer, sweat often flows into the eyes. The sweat irritates the eyes and often causes congestion. Therefore, it seems that laborers are more likely to develop conjunctivitis in the summer. Perhaps this is the reason. To prevent this irritation, avoid letting sweat flow into the eyes.</p>
<p>5. Choose foods that are not irritating. Alcoholic beverages, cilantro, chili peppers, and pepper are best consumed sparingly because they can also reflexively irritate the eyes and cause congestion.</p>
<p>6. Ensure a smooth bowel movement every day. If constipated, take one or two spoonfuls of salt-based products every morning or before bed, such as Jiuda Refined Salt, Euo Fruit Salt, Bishop's Natural Fruit Saline, or Carlsbad Salts. These can be purchased. This will not only reduce the chance of eye diseases but also prevent all kinds of gastrointestinal problems.</p>
<p>7. If you have trachoma, it is best not to swim in public swimming pools to avoid infecting others. This is a matter of personal ethics. According to swimming pool rules, a doctor's certificate is required to participate in swimming. The Shanghai YMCA has already implemented this rule.</p>
<p>8. People who already have eye diseases often feel their condition worsen in the summer. At this time, immediately consult a specialist for a detailed examination.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Placenta and Umbilical Cord (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>(5) Therapeutic Efficacy of the Placenta</p>
<p>The placenta's ability to promote lactation, regulate menstruation, promote uterine development, and replenish general weakness has been widely recognized by modern medical practitioners. Recent reports even suggest that placenta injections can treat measles. Lilly Pharmaceuticals has a placental powder preparation. Byla Pharmaceuticals (managed by Baibu Foreign Firm) has Placeatine pills and injections. The Richter Pharmaceuticals product Hormo Gland Lactagogum also uses the placenta as a major ingredient. However, these placentas are generally from large animals such as cattle and horses. Chinese pharmacies traditionally sell cat placentas. The Compendium of Materia Medica also contains records about human placentas, which is clear evidence that the Chinese have long been aware of its efficacy. However, it has not been widely used because it is difficult to obtain. Based on biological principles, the toxic effects of foreign organ proteins are always more severe than those of the same species. Therefore, humans should eat human placentas, and it is especially suitable for mothers to eat their own placentas. The reason cats, dogs, cattle, and horses eat their own placentas is definitely not for self-purification.</p>
<p>(6) Traditional Methods of Disposing of the Placenta</p>
<p>The placenta is essential for the fetus's survival. Although it is detached after birth, resembling waste, it should not be discarded casually. In our country, some people throw placentas into rivers or the sea, others discard them in the countryside, and some place them in earthenware jars with lime under the bed. Some bury them in the ground, others throw them into toilets or pits, and still others burn them. The author believes that placing them in earthenware jars will eventually lead to disposal. Throwing them into rivers or the sea only feeds fish. Discarding them in the countryside leads to dogs and cats gnawing on them. Burying them in the soil or throwing them into pits inevitably provides sustenance for maggots. Rather than feeding them to animals, why not let humans eat them? Superstitious people fabricate rumors that eating them harms the child's health, which is utterly perplexing.</p>
<p>(7) Should Eating the Placenta Be Prohibited by Law?</p>
<p>According to old customs in our country, because cattle help with plowing and frogs benefit agriculture, some people cannot bear to eat their meat throughout their lives. The law of the previous Qing Dynasty also had explicit provisions prohibiting the slaughter of plowing cattle and the sale of frog meat. Mencius said long ago that fine nets should not be used in ponds, implying that a long-term ban was intended, but it was only a matter of time. In other words, it is prohibited when it has a use and not prohibited when it loses its use. I believe that the placenta's function is limited to the fetal period. After birth, it is akin to worn-out shoes. We are simply utilizing waste by taking and eating it. Why prohibit it? I have had placentas cooked for others to eat, and I myself have eaten it twice. The results have been that I believe that it does indeed have considerable efficacy because irritants have both heat-resistant and heat-sensitive types. In the spring of 1930, when I attended the Eighth National Medical Federation Conference in Japan, I discussed the placenta's efficacy with scholars there and wanted to conduct further research, but it was stopped because Japanese law did not allow it. After returning to China, I wanted to make the idea of mothers eating their own placentas public, but I stopped due to fear of causing misunderstandings. Now that Ye Axiao wants to rejuvenate himself by picking up and eating his grandson's placenta, and his daughter-in-law, steeped in superstition, complains incessantly, resulting in accusations of filial impiety, I am writing this article to express my long-held views. Although customs in our country do not generally involve eating the placenta, I have not seen any legal regulations prohibiting it. Furthermore, ancient prescriptions have long designated it for medicinal use. I believe that future legal regulations should not be constrained by people's superstitions. I ask for your wise opinions on this matter.</p>
<p>(8) Discussion on the Umbilical Cord</p>
<p>The relationship between the umbilical cord and the placenta is like that between lips and teeth. The umbilical cord is the cord-like structure that connects the fetus and the placenta. It consists of one umbilical vein, two umbilical arteries, residual remnants of the yolk sac, an obliterated urachus, Wharton's jelly, and the amniotic membrane. In mature infants, its length averages 50 centimeters, and its diameter is about one centimeter. It is spiral-shaped, and its direction, viewed from the fetal side, is usually to the right. Its attachment to the placenta has several locations: central (20%), marginal (14.5%), lateral (65%), and to the amniotic membrane (0.5%). Its function, as far as we know, is merely a pathway for metabolism between the fetus and the mother. The Compendium of Materia Medica calls it the "Gate of Life" and says that taking the powder can stop malaria (i.e., chronic malaria). Lao Tu Shu says that later generations called the umbilical cord "Kan Jie" or "Kan Qi" and that using it to greatly replenish qi and blood is not correct. The Essentials of Materia Medica also says that it only stops malaria and is used to apply to umbilical sores. According to the research of Japanese scholar Shunshi Ishihara, the umbilical cord contains an irritant that can thoroughly decompose decidual cells and their incomplete decomposition products. He theorized that since cancer cells are abnormally weak and their nature is quite similar to that of decidual cells, they could also be decomposed by this irritant. Therefore, he extracted the irritant and created a drug called P.O.U. (must, cure, heal) as a key drug for cancer. In addition, it is said to have special effects on cervical and vaginal erosions. Based on this, the theory of using it to greatly replenish qi and blood may not be entirely wrong.</p>
<h3>Hygiene of Academic Instruction and Physical Examination of Children (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Speech Draft Delivered at the Public Education Center on July 8th)</p>
<p>The results of physical examinations are beneficial not only for physical education but also for intellectual education. For example, for those with visual or hearing impairments, large blackboard characters or loud explanations can be used to ensure full understanding. Furthermore, for those with intellectual disabilities or behavioral problems caused by systemic or localized illnesses, their parents can be advised to pay attention to monitoring them or to provide special training. In addition, the exploration or elimination of children with low intelligence, poor academic performance, or poor behavior can all be initiated through physical examinations.</p>
<p>(B) Utilization of Physical Examinations. If educators can implement physical examinations diligently, they should make full use of the results of the examinations. In other words, physical examinations are conducted for practical purposes, not for formality.</p>
<p>The goals for utilizing physical examinations are often predetermined. For example, examinations during job applications and school entrance exams. Everyone already knows how to use these, so I won't discuss them now.</p>
<p>I will now discuss how to use regular physical examinations of children in schools. This can be divided into individual utilization and statistical utilization.</p>
<p>(1) Individual Utilization</p>
<p>To utilize the results of physical examinations, one must first organize the physical examination record forms, paying attention to whether each item has been accurately recorded and whether anything is missing. Then, carefully observe each item, report the results to the parents of each child, and provide health advice. In schools, this information should be fully applied to daily instruction and training. In addition, sanitary facilities should be specially added as necessary. Especially, after pre-school examinations, if it is found that a child has difficulty with schoolwork, the child should be temporarily delayed or refused enrollment based on the examination doctor's opinion. If diseases are discovered during temporary or regular examinations while the child is in school, academic instruction can be suspended, the child can be ordered to suspend or withdraw from school, or methods can be devised to restore health or correct shortcomings.</p>
<p>(A) Notification and Advice to Families. This is the method of notifying the parents of children of the examination results. However, simply notifying the family formally is very weak. In practice, thorough health advice must be given. At this time, in addition to the school nurse, the head teacher should also visit the child's home repeatedly and sincerely advise them. If the teachers are not enthusiastic, the effect will certainly be difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>Introducing Guanghua Domestically Made Medicated Plaster</h3>
<p>Medicated plaster is a necessity for medical circles and families in our country. It has a wide range of uses. It is a pity that the Chinese are unable to produce it themselves. Each year, countless foreign products are imported. Now, the Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory, after years of research, has produced a kind of medicated plaster. It is disinfected with precision and has long-lasting adhesion. It is truly a good domestic product. The Guanghua Factory is located at 550 Bazi Road. We hope that the national medical community will vigorously promote it, as it is also a way to recover our economic rights.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (10) (2)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>It can cause inflammatory exudation, which contains polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes, fibrin, and exfoliated alveolar epithelial cells. As for the proliferation of connective tissue, it results in the production of various different cells, which can generally be divided into three types: The first is large cells presenting various forms, called epithelioid cells. Their shapes are round, long, flat, or polygonal. The second is multinucleated giant cells. The third is lymphocytes. The number of these three types of cells varies. Sometimes lymphocytes predominate; sometimes they are completely dominated by epithelioid cells. Giant cells are also sometimes abundant, hence the name "giant cell tuberculosis." The first two types are located in the center of the tubercle, while lymphocytes are on the periphery, surrounding the tubercle like a city wall. Therefore, an ordinary tubercle can be divided into three layers: the inside is necrotic tissue, the outside is epithelioid cells, and the outermost layer is lymphocytes. However, the boundary between lymphocytes and epithelioid cells is sometimes not very distinct.</p>
<p>I have already discussed the nature of a complete tubercle. What happens after that? It is initially grayish-white and transparent, about the size of millet. Later, it gradually develops and enlarges, the transparency becomes cloudy, the grayish-white color turns yellow, and the cells inside die due to lack of nutrition. As a result, a kind of yellow, cheese-like substance is formed, which is "caseous necrosis." This change is the same for both exudative and proliferative tuberculosis. It initially occurs in the center of the tubercle and is limited to a local area. During this period, connective tissue can develop around it, and the boundary between the two is very clear. If the caseous necrosis stops, this connective tissue can turn into pure fibrous connective tissue, which is called caseous fibrotic tuberculosis. In addition, the caseous necrotic part is easily calcified. This is a very welcome phenomenon, as the lesion heals as a result, which is very common.</p>

<p>Special Telegraph Edition</p>
<h3>Voices from the Telegraph World: Telegraphic Text</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>When using telegraphs to transmit news, the key to the message lies not in the heading or the ending, but in the section in the middle, called the telegraphic text.</p>
<p>Telegraph fees are based on the number of words according to regulations (except that the 15-word heading is counted as 5 words for fee calculation). Therefore, the more words, the greater the expense. For the sake of the sender, it is necessary to carefully consider and study the number of words included in the telegraphic text.</p>
<p>In the old warlord era, provincial leaders often issued circular telegrams about the current situation. Written by secretaries, these telegrams were full of allusions and difficult to understand. What could be said in a few words was often spread over lengthy volumes. This was for showing off high talent and was unsuitable for telegrams. In recent years, the Chinese have promoted vernacular Chinese, striving for popularity. However, while the language is simple and there are many interjections, it may be clear, but it is not economical. Therefore, no matter how far vernacular Chinese is promoted in society, it is rarely used in telegraphic text. The reason is probably due to this.</p>
<p>Telegrams are used for communication, and in essence, they are no different from postal letters, except that the transmission speed and the calculation of fees are different. Those skilled at writing telegraphic text use concise words to express their meaning clearly. When sending a telegram, it is both fast and economical. However, some people strive to save words as much as possible, trying to shorten the telegraphic text as much as possible, but this results in ambiguous meanings and misunderstandings. This is "too much is as bad as too little" and is not a good strategy.</p>
<p>The telegraph office calculates fees based on the number of words and is not allowed to advise on the content of the telegraphic text. Moreover, more words mean more income. From a business perspective, there is no need to take the sender into account too much. However, examining the state of telegraph services in our country over the years, most of the telegrams sent by the political and military circles are often hundreds or even thousands of words long (in the past, some telegrams were more than a thousand words). On the other hand, ordinary commercial telegrams or private telegrams often contain only a few words. The military and politics cannot be compared, and the number of words cannot be weighed against each other. However, merchants' reluctance to spend money is a fact, and officials and soldiers receive preferential treatment, so they do not try to be concise when writing. Wise people may find this difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>The abuse of official and military telegrams not only harms revenue but also clogs the lines, causing commercial telegrams to be delayed. In order to facilitate the people and streamline telegraph services, the Ministry of Communications must take some action to rectify the situation and impose restrictions (rectification measures have already been announced). This move should be understood by the outside world. However, lengthy telegraphic text also has a significant impact on the transmission of telegrams. Simplifying what should be simplified will be beneficial to assisting communication. Furthermore, since the number of words in official and military telegrams is reduced, the arrival time will naturally be faster. This is the best way to balance both sides. Therefore, in addition to rectifying the situation, we must also deeply hope that those who send official and military telegrams will do so.</p>
<h3>Rainy Season and Telecommunications Engineering</h3>
<p>— Wang Qikun</p>
<p>South of the Yangtze River, there is a lot of rain in early summer, coinciding with the ripening of plums, hence the name "Plum Rain." It lasts for about a month, and the amount of rainfall is abundant, which is very beneficial to rice paddies. However, it also causes mold to grow on everything, which has considerable disadvantages. Telecommunications engineering is also affected by it.</p>
<p>Among telecommunications, wireless radio is the most popular. Almost all large stores in commercial ports have wireless radios to attract customers. For those with poor radios, their coils become moldy and ineffective after the rainy season. Non-professional-made radios are especially prone to staining with sweat when winding the coils, leading to mold and current leakage. Therefore, it is advisable to apply a solution of foreign lacquer dissolved in alcohol to the outside of the coil to prevent moisture from entering. However, the alcohol on the market often contains water and is difficult to obtain purely, so applying it can be harmful to insulation.</p>
<p>Telegraph machines are mostly simple in structure and rarely have the above-mentioned weaknesses. Telegraph lines are almost entirely bare overhead wires, and there are places where they are close to trees. In early summer, trees are lush, and branches and leaves come into contact with telegraph lines, causing obstacles. Moreover, after prolonged rain, the telegraph line's supports (insulators, crossbars, wooden poles, etc.) and tree branches are soaked, leading to more current leakage, line mixing, and earth connections, which make communication difficult or even impossible.</p>
<p>The impact of the rainy season on telephone engineering is most significant. In terms of lines, they are more complex than telegraph lines. The environment of long-distance telephone lines is the same as that of telegraph lines, but telephone lines are mainly in cities, and their bare copper wires have more opportunities to come into contact with tree branches, buildings, and so on, so there are naturally more obstacles in the rainy season. In addition to bare copper wires, city telephone lines also have overhead and underground cables. In the transition between spring and summer, insects breed, and overhead cables are often gnawed by them. Once rainwater enters, the entire cable loses its function. Manholes and tunnels for underground cables in areas south of the Yangtze River often become sewers in disguise. After prolonged rain, they become filled with stagnant water, and the lead skin of the cables is immersed in sewage for a long time, which easily corrodes it over time, eventually leading to irrecoverable damage. In terms of machinery, telephones use more coils than wireless radios, especially automatic telephones. City telephones connect one wire in the loop to the earth. If the other wire, whether in the bureau or outside, gets an earth connection due to moisture, the circuit is completed, and the relays in the circuit will operate or reset automatically, causing frequent obstacles. The way to prevent this in the bureau is to strictly close the doors and windows of the automatic machine room to isolate the inside from the outside and to light electric stoves and lamps to keep the room dry. The electrical machinery of automatic telephone bureau's long-distance consoles and measuring consoles is connected to automatic machines. Even if they are in separate rooms, it is not appropriate to open doors and windows at will, and it is sometimes appropriate to light baking lamps. Ordinary people feel uncomfortable when the air is humid, and in the yellow plum weather, when it is sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy, with heat and humidity combined, they feel even more irritable. Employees in automatic telephone bureaus who hold important positions must stay indoors, steamed by stoves and lamps. The mental suffering is indescribable, and women and those with nervous temperaments are especially prone to dizziness and vomiting. Secondly, in humid places, such as the capital, the copper locks and chains on boxes and tables often rust after the rainy season. Telephones are installed close to or hung on walls, and they are exposed to more moisture, which causes the carbon particles in the transmitters to clump together, the springs in the dial to corrode, or the wiring inside the machine to leak electricity. If a person touches the machine, they will feel a slight shock. In cases like these, telephone users often feel inconvenience and cannot understand the reason; On the telephone bureau side, there are many complaints, increased workload, and both intangible and tangible losses.</p>
<p>This year, many places suffered drought during the rainy season, and the above-mentioned difficulties can be eliminated invisibly. However, I am afraid that there will be more rain in the fall, coupled with typhoons, then the impact on telecommunications engineering will be even greater than the plum rain.</p>
<h3>Overseas Communication Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Ji Ran</p>
<p>Telegram communication is still rare in our country. This year, the Ministry of Communications has set low prices to vigorously promote it. Although there have been some achievements, it cannot be compared with the prevalence of overseas communication telegrams and the large number of users. In Europe and America, sending telegrams is commonplace. For celebrations and condolences, it goes without saying. Even between men and women, separated by distance, exchanging affections and arranging meetings often involve telegrams. How comforted is the receiver by such intense emotions and secret intentions?</p>
<p>As for famous figures in the political arena, giants of society, as well as scientists and artists, when they encounter joyful, commendable, praiseworthy, or mournful events, communication telegrams often fly in like snowflakes. The telegraph offices have to increase their workload, and the lines become congested. This kind of phenomenon is quite common. Now, let me cite an example that will leave readers in awe.</p>
<p>On May 21, 1927, Colonel Lindbergh's heroic feat of flying across the Atlantic Ocean was successfully completed. On the day after he flew from New York to Paris, congratulatory telegrams from all over the world poured in. This continued for several days, with a total of more than 100,000 telegrams received. All the staff at the telegraph office worked day and night, yet still felt overwhelmed. It can be said that they were extremely busy. Among these telegrams, one was sent from Minneapolis, with as many as 17,000 people signing their names. The strip of paper on which the names were printed reached about 600 feet in length. This is one example of communication telegrams.</p>
<p>On January 30 of this year, on President Roosevelt's 52nd birthday, he received a congratulatory telegram that was 1,290 feet long and weighed 8 pounds and 2 ounces. A total of 41,000 people signed the end of the telegram. This congratulatory telegram was processed by the Western Union Telegraph Company in Birmingham, Alabama, and sent to Washington using a high-speed automatic telegraph machine, taking a total of 1,148 minutes. This is another example of communication telegrams.</p>
<p>In our country, there are not yet such great achievers, nor such a huge number of communication telegrams. From this, we can see the extent of the difference between China and the West is still vast, and as I write this, I cannot help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Telegraph Business and Public Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The telegraph business is a type of public utility, and the quality of its operations greatly affects public relations. Therefore, those who handle telegraph business should base their actions on the public interest. This is the reason for the call for the commercialization and democratization of the telegraph. In recent years, the telegraph authorities have been committed to reforming the business, and there has been much progress. Whether it is the joint establishment of postal and telegraph offices, the merger of wireless telegraphs, the commissioning of travel agencies to collect telegrams on behalf of the telegraph office, or the revision of telegram fees, almost all of these are based on the premise of facilitating the public. Since the relationship between telegraph business and the public is so close, the need for public cooperation is all the more urgent. The mission of the telegraph is accuracy and speed, but without the cooperation of the public, it is difficult to achieve this goal. Now, please allow me to explain why.</p>
<p>From our experience, errors in telegrams often occur due to illegible handwriting or incorrect translation by the sender. The telegraph office has always paid great attention to the writing of telegrams. All telegram forms, whether in Chinese or foreign languages, have warnings such as "Please do not write illegibly" to remind the sender to pay attention. However, there are still cases of illegible handwriting that cannot be identified. Although the receiving clerk can sometimes ask the sender to correct the writing, it often takes a long time, which delays other telegraph services and greatly affects the telegraph business. Furthermore, errors in translation can lead to non-delivery or unclear meaning, which is a loss for the sender and something the telegraph office does not want. In other cases, senders may try to save money, resulting in incomplete addresses for the recipients, making delivery impossible. This is also a common problem. (Note: Since January 1, 1934, the new regulation that the recipient's name and address will be charged as five characters if it is less than fifteen characters has reduced this problem considerably.) Therefore, for the benefit of both parties, the conditions for which we require the sender's cooperation are very simple: namely, "Write legibly," "Translate carefully," and "Provide complete recipient names and addresses!"</p>
<p>From the recipient's perspective, we require two conditions for cooperation: namely, "Please do not detain the telegram messenger" and "Please send incorrectly delivered telegrams directly to the telegraph office, and do not pass them on to others." When a telegram is delivered to the recipient, a seal must be affixed to the receipt and returned to the messenger. This procedure is very simple and can be completed in a few seconds. However, recipients often want to open and read the telegram immediately, without taking the time to complete the procedure, causing the messenger to be unnecessarily delayed. We urge recipients to eliminate this habit in order to speed up telegram delivery. If the recipient discovers that a telegram has been delivered incorrectly, please return it to the telegraph office immediately, and do not pass it on to others, to avoid misunderstandings. This is a procedure that the telegraph office should have, and we hope that recipients will cooperate with it. In addition, if large commercial firms receive telegrams outside of business hours, delays often occur because no one is there to receive them. Please contact the telegraph office directly to discuss (see the semi-monthly news in this publication) setting receiving hours to avoid the above-mentioned situation, and we hope that major commercial firms will provide the telegraph office with convenience and cooperation.</p>
<p>The above is common knowledge and does not require in-depth discussion. However, due to habit, senders and recipients may not pay attention, which affects both parties. We urge the telegraph office and the public to cooperate sincerely to seek mutual convenience, which will also increase mutual benefits.</p>
<h3>Postal Transfer Telegrams and the Inland People</h3>
<p>— Kaidi</p>
<p>China has 4.31 million square miles of territory and a population of 470 million, but the country has only over 1,100 telegraph offices. Not only is this incomparable to European and American countries, but even compared to our neighbor,</p>
<p>According to statistics from March 1932, there were as many as 7,711 telegraph offices. Looking back at the telegraph offices in the three provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, there are only 151, which makes one feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Because China's telecommunications industry has not yet reached a widespread level of development, although the people in large cities and towns with telegraph offices can enjoy the convenience of telegraph communication, the people in the inland areas not only cannot enjoy it, but may not even know what a "telegram" is. In order to facilitate communication for the people in the inland areas and to supplement the inadequacy of telegraph offices, the Ministry of Communications has a regulation for "postal transfer telegrams." However, since its inception, telegram business has been quite slow. According to statistics for the year 1933, there were only about 32,000 postal transfer telegrams nationwide, which is less than the number of telegrams in Shanghai in a single month. The reasons for this are approximately two: First, the people in the inland areas have a closed mindset, their knowledge is undeveloped, and their level of education is very basic. They do not have a deep understanding of "telegrams." They do not understand the term "postal transfer telegrams," so how can they use them? Second, the price of telegrams is too high. In addition to the regular fees, sending a postal transfer telegram also requires an additional postage fee of 25 cents or 50 cents, which adds up to at least two or three yuan, making it unaffordable for the people in the inland areas. Therefore, if we want postal transfer telegrams to develop and to make them universally available to the people in the inland areas, we still need to promote them and make improvements.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to achieve the true commercialization and democratization of the telegraph industry, the transportation authorities are striving to reform the internal organization, personnel management, rule of law, telegraph efficiency, speed and accuracy, public convenience, simplicity and affordability, and so on, and are moving forward in an effort to innovate. They are also paying close attention to the convenience of sending telegrams for the people in the inland areas. For example, the recent effort to promote "joint postal and telegraph offices" and the implementation of waiving the postage fee for "postal transfer telegrams" from March 15 of this year are all of great significance in facilitating communication for the people throughout the country. Joint postal and telegraph offices are currently in a trial period and will not be discussed for the time being. For now, let's briefly explain the content of "postal transfer telegrams."</p>
<p>Types of Postal Transfer Telegrams: Postal transfer telegrams are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A postal transfer telegrams refer to telegrams sent from place A, which has a post office but no telegraph office, through place B, which has a telegraph office or a joint postal and telegraph agency, to place C, which has a telegraph office, for delivery. (See Figure 1)</p>
<p>Type B postal transfer telegrams refer to telegrams sent from place A, which has a telegraph office, through place B, which has a joint telegraph and post office or a postal agency, to place C, which has a post office or postal agency but no telegraph office. (See Figure 2)</p>
<p>Type C postal transfer telegrams refer to telegrams sent from place A, which has a post office but no telegraph office, through place B, which has a joint telegraph and post office or a postal agency and where there is telegraph line, to place D, which has a post office or postal agency but no telegraph office. (See Figure 3)</p>
<p>Price of Postal Transfer Telegrams: Postal transfer telegrams, whether in Chinese or foreign languages, whether clear or coded, whether express or regular, can all be sent. The prices are exactly the same as for domestic telegrams. That is, for Chinese plain language, it is 10 cents per character; for Chinese coded language and foreign languages, it is 20 cents per character; and for express telegrams, it is double. Previously, for types A and B postal transfer telegrams, an additional postage fee of 25 cents was charged in addition to the regular fees, and for type C postal transfer telegrams, because they were transferred twice by the post office, an additional postage fee of 50 cents was charged. In order to facilitate communication for the people in the inland areas, the authorities have issued an order to all telegraph offices and post offices nationwide, effective March 15 of this year, to waive this postage fee. Moreover, if the recipient's name and address in a Chinese postal transfer telegram are less than 15 characters, they will be charged as 5 characters, and the translation fee will also be waived. Therefore, although the postal transfer telegram transmission procedures are slightly more complicated, the price is not higher than that of ordinary telegrams.</p>
<p>Postal Transfer Telegram Sending Procedures: If people in places without telegraph offices but with post offices (postal agencies are not included) have urgent matters, they can send types A and C postal transfer telegrams to various places with domestic telegraph offices or post offices and postal agencies from the local post office. If people in places with telegraph offices need to communicate with people in places without telegraph offices but with post offices or postal agencies, they can send type B postal transfer telegrams to any telegraph office. The sending procedures are very simple. The sender only needs to write the recipient's name, address, and telegram message clearly and hand them over to the telegraph office or post office, which will then collect the fees and send the telegram. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>(Example 1) If the sender is in Jiading, Jiangsu, and a family member is seriously ill, urging relatives in Tianjin to come quickly to see them, they can send a type A postal transfer telegram to the Jiading Post Office, as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Hanqing, No. 30, Lane 26, French Concession, Tianjin. Mother seriously ill, return quickly, Uncle.</p>
<p>This telegram has a total of 21 characters. According to the old regulations, the telegram fee and postage would total $2.35, but according to the current new regulations, because the recipient's name and address are within 15 characters, they are charged as 5 characters, and the postage and translation fees are waived, so only $1.10 is charged. If this telegram is sent from the Jiading Post Office at 8:00 AM, it will be sent quickly to Shanghai by mail immediately after the Jiading Post Office receives it, and by 1:00 or 2:00 PM that afternoon, it can be transferred from the Shanghai Telegraph Office to the recipient in Tianjin!</p>
<p>(Example 2) For example, if the sender is in Shanghai and the school examination period is imminent, and they want to notify a classmate in Daodizhen, Hebei Province, to come quickly, they can send a type B postal transfer telegram to the Shanghai Telegraph Office, as follows:</p>
<p>Tang Zijia, Yuanfeng Firm, East Street, Daodizhen, Tangshan. (17th) Examination, come quickly, Lan.</p>
<p>This telegram has a total of 18 characters. According to the old regulations, the telegram fee and postage would total $1.75, but according to the current new regulations, only $1.00 is charged. If this telegram is sent from the Shanghai Telegraph Office at 10:00 PM on the 12th, it will arrive in Tangshan that night. The Tangshan Telegraph Office will send it out by express mail the next morning, and it will definitely arrive in Daodizhen by noon on the 13th. The recipient will receive the telegram on the 14th and catch the Shanghai-Ping train to leave, so there will be no delay for the examination.</p>
<p>(Example 3) For example, if the sender is in Jiading and is sending relatives to Shanghai to take the Shanghai-Ping train to Tianjin, and they want to notify the recipient in Daodizhen to go to Tianjin to meet the train, they can send a type C postal transfer telegram to the Jiading Post Office, as follows:</p>
<p>Li Yuying, No. 36, Taoyuanfang, South Street, Daodizhen, Tangshan. Mother (10th) Shanghai-Ping train arrives in Tianjin, meet, Hui.</p>
<p>This telegram has a total of 25 characters. According to the old regulations, the telegram fee and postage would total $2.80, but according to the current new regulations, only $1.50 is charged. If this telegram is sent from the Jiading Post Office at 9:00 AM, it will definitely be transferred from the Shanghai Telegraph Office to Tangshan by noon that day. The Tangshan Telegraph Office will send it out by express mail immediately, and it can arrive in Daodizhen by 4:00 or 5:00 PM that day. After receiving the telegram, the recipient will leave for Tianjin on the 10th to meet the train, so there will be no delay.</p>
<p>From the above examples, we can see that if we send a regular letter, it will take at least three to five days to arrive, which would delay everything. Therefore, the low price and high efficiency of postal transfer telegrams are indeed a convenient communication tool for the people in the inland areas. Before we can universally increase the number of telegraph offices throughout the country, due to the current financial constraints of the telegraph, it is indeed necessary to vigorously promote postal transfer telegrams in order to facilitate communication for the people in the inland areas and develop the telegraph business.</p>

<h3>British Telephones in 1933</h3>
<p>— Dun</p>
<p>The international section contains 155 switchboard positions, 82 for wireless telephone calls (including four for supervision or searching), and 123 for calls to the mainland. Among the 123 positions, 30 are cancelled upon completion during peak hours, and other positions begin "direct business." The automatic transfer machine used has also been newly improved. In addition, the "clock" that switchboard operators can observe at any time during the call is also quite remarkable. Each time a telephone call is connected, the clock's hand starts to rotate, allowing the operator to immediately observe the duration of the call with great accuracy. In case of difficulty, the operator immediately stops its progress until the call resumes. Therefore, the time shown by the clock is the time for billing.</p>
<p>The London intercity multiplex telephone can be said to be completed. Therefore, direct calls can now be made on all telephone lines departing from the British capital. As for the provinces, either new multiplex machines have been installed, or old machines have been changed. For example, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Newcastle, Swansea, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Belfast have also established direct call services. (The new multiplex machine in Manchester City was also completed and opened between February and March of this year. There are also no less than 100 small central telephone offices that are also scheduled to establish direct call services in the spring.) Seeing this, the speed at which direct call services are becoming popular in the UK is truly astonishing. However, it is still worth noting that the intercity telephone lines do not need to be added as a result. This result was achieved by eliminating various unnecessary tasks in the past, such as the handling of registered labels and the "re-" calls of users. Direct calls are indeed a major advancement in business methods, and the sharp increase in the number of calls is sufficient to prove that they are very popular with customers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efforts are also being made to improve long-distance telephones in order to transmit and receive clearly and loudly. However, past and present efforts have been limited to the lines of the above-mentioned major centers. As for improving other lines, it would cost a lot and could not be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<p>5.  International Lines</p>
<p>In order to develop international business, new lines have been laid between the UK and France, Norway, the Netherlands, and Denmark. A direct line has been established between London and the Polish capital to facilitate calls to Poland and Russia. A new telephone cable has also been laid between Saint Margaret's Bay in the UK and the coast near Calais in France to improve traffic between the UK and France, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain. The manufacture of this telephone cable is different from that of ordinary cables and can be used for "carrier wave" communication when needed.</p>
<p>In addition, wireless telephone service between the UK and India has also been opened.</p>
<p>6.  Trials and Research</p>
<p>The British Post Office established a technical trial and research organization several years ago, but its position was very narrow and its work was very inconvenient. Therefore, a large and well-equipped laboratory was specially built in Dollis Hill, and the British Prime Minister personally held the opening ceremony in October of last year.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of New Zealand Quotations</h3>
<p>The new regulations for telegraph billing have been announced by the Post Office. Previously, the cost of ordinary telegrams to and from various parts of the country was one shilling for every 12 words, and express telegrams and telegrams sent on Sundays or holidays were charged double. The new regulations, which will be implemented from April 3, charge six pence for a minimum of 12 words within the country. For each additional word, the charge is one penny, up to a maximum of one shilling and three pence. Delivery addresses are not counted. Express telegrams are charged the same as ordinary telegrams, with only an additional charge of six shillings, and there is no Sunday price difference.</p>
<h3>New Equipment for Wireless Telegraphy in Submarines</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The Mackay Company recently installed a new type of radio direction-finding equipment in submarines, using a telescopic antenna system. This equipment does not interfere with the navigation of ships. The accuracy obtained when the submarine is floating on the surface or submerged 35 feet below the surface is the same as that obtained on commercial vessels. The receiver can be installed at any point within 20 feet of the antenna. The direction finder can be used for ordinary reception within its frequency band of 300 to 400 meters.</p>
<h3>General Telecommunications Statistics</h3>

<p>Telegraph Office Consults with Various Commercial Firms on Methods for Receiving Telegrams Outside of Office Hours</p>
<p>It is often the case that when telegrams are sent to major commercial firms outside of office hours or on Sundays and holidays, there is no one to receive them. When telegram messengers encounter this situation, they have no choice but to put the telegram in the mailbox first and pick up the receipt the next day. Upon investigation, this method is very likely to</p>
<p>Cause delays or disputes. In order to protect the interests of the recipients, the Ministry of Communications has specifically instructed the major telegraph offices to consult with various commercial firms on methods for receiving telegrams outside of office hours, in order to improve the efficiency of both parties and achieve the benefits of mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>Increased Number of Telegraph Offices</p>
<p>The following telegraph offices have recently been added: Mulandian, Pantouzhen, Wendizhen, Yanshi (Henan Province), Hangu, Puyang, Xugezhuang (Hebei Province), Shunchang, Yangkou, Chong'an (Fujian Province), Baimi, Mudu, Longtan, Yangzhuang, Zhewang, Yangzhong, Caoyanzhen (Jiangsu Province), Huili, Jinchuanqiao (Sichuan Province), Benyuan, Caijiazhuang (Shandong Province), Tengtian, Longgang (Jiangxi Province), Bandi (Hubei Province), Yanggao (Shanxi Province), Zhangmutou (Guangdong Province).</p>
