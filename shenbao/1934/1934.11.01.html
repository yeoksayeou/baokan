<p>我國幅員廣博。氣候裑雜。由亞之熱帶以至於寒帶。人口均甚繁殖。而又皆以農業要業務。以是天時之關係。極爲重要。夫水旱天災之流行。既不能免。則所賴以防禦者。惟視人事上之致力何如耳。最上雖有水旱而不使成災。至少亦須令天災減少其爲害之力量。所請人定勝天。以人力克服自然是也。今年揚子江中下游各區。自江浙以迄湖南。廣被旱災影響。有顆粒無收者。有五六分收成者。有一二收成者。其全部收成何如。雖乏正當確切之統計。然就大體估量。米榖收穫。恐不及常年十分之七。則農村食糧。已成問題。在大都市或可借外米外麥以事調劑。而中小城市又將如。現時正值新榖上市之際。猶不能免饑饉。秋去冬來。天候漸寒。則一般鄉村又將如何。此吾國人之所懸心者也。</p>
<p>吾國農村。經若干年來不斷之天災人禍。經濟枯竭。已達極點。即今雨順風調。年榖豐登。亦祗得偷旦夕之安。矧復值此大旱之奇荒乎。更有甚者。從前農村副業。如江浙之絲茶。四川之桐油等。亦足以潤澤一般農民。使普通社會。稍見活動。國民經濟。亦有相當補助。然而今日世界經濟凋落。原料及半製造品之輸出。亦同臨末運。此其影響於我國農村。實甚重大。且此後各種代替物品之日趨發達。各國謀原料之自給自足。亦異常進步。我農村副業。勢將更陷於苦境。故在今日茍不有澈底有效有之自救政策。則前途之危。誠有不堪設想者。我國城市之所以尚見發達者。或以政治關係。或以商業上之物品交換。其真有工業基礎者。實居少數。故我經濟。對內缺乏伸縮之彈力。對外更少操縱自如之餘地。至以消費一方論。在大都市中具有充分實力者。亦僅少數。農村經濟週轉失靈之後。專事運輸之商業。自惑困難。甫經發育之工業。更受影響。世界產業先進國家。在此非常時期。茍農代業發展。失去平衡。則整個國民經濟。必即感受痛苦。蓋工業生產品。在國內市塲。一旦縮小。海外消路。一旦窒息。則生產過剩。立即可以成災。況我國貧弱。農村尚在手工業時代。即大城市中之產業組織。猶在初步發展。而農村凋敝如是。共堪受此影響乎。</p>
<p>今爲目前自救計。其治標辦法。惟有乘此時期。善用先進諸國過剰之機械力。輔以低廉之人工。從事於工業建設。製造廉價出品。同時詳細考究農村消費力。務使本國製品。適合乎農村之需求。價格又須爲農村經濟力量所能勝。則國內市塲。或可逐浙開發。但目前農產物市物。在產原地尤爲低落。綜合計算。幾不能敷衍生產原本。農民生活。困難如是。對工業生產物之消費。自等於零。其轉換之道。端在提高農產市價。予農民以種種經濟上之便利。即所以間接提高農村消費。欲恢復此衰頹之市面。非於此盡力研究以求得其著手之方法不可也。</p>
<h3 id="c17">蘇俄發表中東路談判經過 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>延宕之責歸之日方</p>
<p>路價已定餘多支節</p>
<p>莫斯科近日日本報界對於中東路出售談判之進行常作不正確之報告、同時滿洲各報復對蘇聯橫加責雞、進行其反蘇聯宣傳、頃塔斯社自消息靈通方面探得關於談判真相之消息如下、</p>
<p>自塔斯社於八月十八日及八月二十八日發表關於談判進行之報告後、日外務省代表即力根據日滿方面之要求、（即彼等所提建議須全部接受）、建議重開自八月初即告破裂之談判、日廣田外相於九月六日向蘇聯大使優列浧夫聲明、願將七月二十三日日滿所提路價一萬二千萬日金、提高至一萬三千萬日金、九月十二日優列湼夫答覆廣田聲稱按照蘇聯政府意見、此項談判歷時已十五、此時不宜再事細微而拖延之論價、而宜謀此項談判之異正結束、蘇聯政府於七月三十日所提一萬六千萬日金之價顯已蒙極大犧牲因此數低於中東路費用遠甚、唯如此項論價即能結束、同時日本政府能立即同意者、則蘇聯政府復顧減價至一萬四千五百萬日金、其時廣田復出價一萬四千萬日金、</p>
<p>九月十九日優列湼夫知照廣田、謂蘇聯政府不願見談判之長此遷延願以一萬四千萬日金之價出賣、唯中東路解雇員工之津貼金不在其內、</p>
<p>雙方對於路價既經同意、遂進行其他出售條件之談判、其中最所注意者爲鐵路讓渡及村欵保障之條件問題、關於第一項問題、日滿方面建議、出售恊定一經簽訂、則該路一切權利即行讓渡於滿國唯日滿方面同時主張、鐵路之讓渡須於恊定簽訂後一個月內執行、蘇聯方面爲求恊定之迅速簽訂計、接受廣田所提在恊定簽訂以後即將所有權讓渡日本之建議、唯於其所提讓渡之條件則不能同意、恩如此則滿國一面爲鐵路之主人、而於讓渡期內該路業務及經濟地位應由蘇聯負責矣、根據目下日滿當局心理度之、如此辦法將發生種種嚴重之衢突、面有害於兩國之邦交、同時此項賣價並非其真正價格、而僅爲雙方同意之正數、故日滿方面所提鐵路讓渡興接收時應照財產目錄路細目及一切賬目交興廣田、該路負憤說明亦在其內、此項負債當由新主人負償還之責、如此則尤見日滿方面之要求爲無根據矣、</p>
<p>以理言之、出售恊定簽訂之際、僅須附以關於鐵路第一聲明書已呈交後所有債務之附件、</p>
<p>其次難題爲滿國所負關於不立即付卻之部份、以及日本保證滿國履行其以現金及貨物償付路價之問題、廣田反對蘇聯方面之要求、而主張蘇聯應無須保證、對於滿國適用信任之原則、唯蘇聯於恊定簽訂之後、究將偌大交通機關讓渡滿國、故其於滿國能如期履行其義務（欠欵分三年償還）之願望、實至易了解者、</p>
<p>此外復有一爭端占重要地位、即蘇在有一部份財產並不屬於中東路、而僅於干涉運動及蘇聯內戰時期截留滿洲者、此項財產之交回蘇聯、現亦成爲問題、</p>
<p>其他若于問題雙方已獲諒解、如路價付欵確定三分之二用貨物、三分之一用現欵、且得於國外交付、同時現欵半數須於恊定簽訂後立即交清、此外雙方在原則上同意、如日金匯兌率低過一定限度、則貨幣支付應改按當時金滙兌率計算、關於蘇員解雇問題、雙方同意滿洲新管理局須於三個月前發給解職通知、並準彼等留居滿洲兩月、以便料理私事、解職雇員得按照現用路章、全部解決彼等與路方之賬項、同時其家屬及什物得免費途至蘇聯邊境、</p>
<p>由上所述、已可概見大部份日滿報紙反宣傳之爲無根矣、蘇聯在此歷時近一年有半之談判中、曾勉力爲日蘇邦交及一般和平著想、努力促成談判之完成、此點已無人能加否認、蘇聯之努力雖備受對方之阻撓、然此非蘇聯之罪、消息靈通方面復稱此項談判所以遷延之另一原因、乃在日滿方面往往撤回其原議、</p>
<p>現時留存之主要差異乃在付欵之保證問題、日滿方面如能善意相待、則最近期內各項重要問題必能圓滿解決云、（三十一日塔斯電）</p>
<p>東京　駐日蘇聯大使優列尼夫昨訪廣田外相、對外相二十二日所提示之讓渡條件案、提示莫斯科政府之回答、討論至午後七時未得結論、定本日上午十時繼續恊議、惟蘇聯方面之回答有重申從來主張之觀、欲俟雙方意見一致、恐尚須相當時日、至蘇聯方面提示之對案內容如下、一日政府所保證之滿洲國公債、應於簽字時同時交與蘇聯、二用物資支付者、期限二年、物資價格由蘇日滿三國委員決定之、三財產目錄雖當再行提出、然各種財產之估價等、應於事前討論、應留於蘇聯方面之公共營造物、仍照從來之主張、四蘇聯職員之退職津貼與東路退職津貼、另爲一事、五交代時期簽字後一個月、（三十一日電通電）</p>

<p>日雖新提漸進平等之議</p>
<p>英美仍堅持現行比率制</p>
<p>羅斯福突與史汀生長談</p>
<p>倫敦　英美日三國之海軍談話現臻危迫之階段、衆望今日美日代表之會晤或可打破僵局、而爲趨向折衷辦法之一轉機、美日代表對於對方之竟見現已詳悉、刻正通船籌劃、以期覔得未來討論之基礎、日本之立塲現極難捉摸、英美如許其有海軍平等權、日本雖不欲立即使其海軍與各國平等、但願於若干年內告成之、英美則均表示保持五。五。三比率堅決之意志、故對於逐漸告成平等之議、似必予以反對、因其等於打破比率故也、目前之局勢可稱爲千鈞一髪、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓羅斯福總統今日與胡佛任內之國務總理史汀生晤談其久、據史氏稱、所談者爲普通外交事務云、惟於茲倫敦海軍談話正在進行之時、美日關係之內幕應予特別注意也、國務院遠東司長賀貝克及其他國務院財部官員亦於總統會晤史汀生後被召、彼等近曾從事商務稅務談判、（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>惟不願接受紙上平等</p>
<p>華盛頓日本駐美大使齋藤今日向報界宣稱、日本並非欲與英美海軍平等、惟願於若干年內達此目的云、齋藤大使新近歸國、與外務省及海軍省領袖會商一切、返任之後發此言論、大概可使日本在倫敦海軍談話中提出要求所引起之緊張空氣稍爲和緩、據倫敦報告觀之、日本係要求立刻平等、茲齋藤大使雖有此解釋、然亦切實聲明、謂日本所稱平等係軍艦噸位之平等、而非名目上空談之平等、有人解釋此言爲係答覆報紙上所載美國之提議、即軍艦之實力當以各國之比較安全爲根據、依照此種提議、日本因地勢孤立、有三成半之特殊安全、故若有六成半之海軍實力、已與英美平等、茲齋藤大使則謂必須軍艦及砲位相等、日本始能滿意、如他國願意減縮、日本亦願減縮、祇須最後能得平等即可、齋藤氏否認日本政府現擬與美國訂立不侵條約、至於昨日消息所謂美國海軍已完成建築太平洋海空軍根據地防務之計劃、以應付日本之廢止海軍條約要求、齋藤氏對之並未表示意見、（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>倫敦　日美兩代表團原定本日開會、然因兩方意見對立、決定取消、改日舉行、美代表臺維斯因疲勞靜養中、日代表團將於三十一日招待美代表團至日本大使館、說明日本關於攻擊的武器及防禦的武器之解釋、（三十日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　日本代表團已經與英美兩國各開兩次會議、說明日本軍縮方針、然未得兩國承認、由此演進、將來日本與英美之對立更爲深刻、松平大使於是決定改以私的會談之形式、進行交涉、三十日下午訪問英西門外相交換意見、松平更於三十一日下午四時半會見美代表臺維斯、交換意見、（三十日日聯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　日代表松平大使三十日下午訪問英國下院、在外相室會見西門外相、作秘密會談、（三十日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　美日海軍代表定於本日午後四點三十分舉行重要談話、俾令海軍問題得以進展、據美國首度代表臺維斯左右人士所獲印象、本日交換意見時、美國代表擬更進一步探知日本提案之詳細內容、並開始討論日本要求之數字、而日本方面則似抱定決心、要求對於日本所提出各主要原則先行取得同意後、方可進一步討論數字、因此雙方意見仍屬互相衝突、惟今日午後、或可覓得一種方式、以掩蔽雙方之根本衝突、至少或可設法使談判繼續不輟、昨晚英國外相西門會晤日本駐英大使松平時、曾表示英國內閣具有此種願望、至於美國方面、則始終力持審慎、以謀避免談判之破裂、蓋美國國會日內即將舉行局部改選、如談判一旦破裂、則美國國內與論對於政府殊多不利也、雖然、至目前爲止、各方對於本問題之根本態度仍屬無法調和云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>公司昨得電告</p>
<p>已在澈查真相</p>
<p>法租界公館馬路海昌輪船公司、共有海順。海平。海昌。三輪、行駛上海營口間、海平輪上次由滬赴營後、靠泊南滿鐵道會社碼頭、裝載撫順煤二千二百噸、於昨日上午九時許、因已裝齊、即自營口開出、直放上海、原定十一月六日、抵埠交缷、</p>

<p>船貨全失　海平輪在南滿碼頭外擋沉、艙內二千二百噸撫順煤、一併隨輪沒入港內、幸艙內未乘旅客、所有全體船員、於失事後、因靠近碼頭、均得逃至岸上、但各人公私物件、則盡損失、不及攜取矣、</p>

<p>舊花不能再貼靜候登記掉換</p>
<p>新印花稅法雖通過尚未施行</p>
<p>財政部印行之新寶塔圓樣印花、於今日起、在各地郵局開始發售、惟關於此事、本市商人、頗有誤會新印花稅法、亦即於同日實行者、以致昨日各商界、均紛紛電話市商會詢問、茲由市商會秘書嚴諤聲正式發表解釋如下、</p>
<h3 id="c120">條例有效 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>查現在貼用印花、係照中華民國國民政府印花稅暫行條例辦理、該條例共計九條、分貼用印花之件爲四類、計第一類十五種、第二類十四種、第三類四十五種、第四類四種、總共七十八種、至立法院通過之新印花稅法、現尚未經國民政府公布施行、且各地商會均在力爭修改、當然未能適用、</p>
<h3 id="c121">舊花登記 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>至原有舊印花稅票、前由市商會向部力爭、以舊易新、業經財政部批準、俟登記後、酌予分期掉換新票、惟登記及掉換辦法、正在財政部擬訂中、現在尚未公布、最近市商會亦曾去電催促、迅行頒布、但可言者、則舊印花自十一月一日起、不能再行貼用、然亦非廢棄可俟財政部頒布登記辦法後、酌予分期掉換新花、</p>
<h3 id="c122">不必重貼 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>十一月一日起、貼用新花、係指新訂立之憑證而言、如者舊有憑證、已經貼有舊花係、亦不必再貼新花、如本年度賬簿、在年度開始時、已經照貼舊花、現在當然繼續有效、可至年度結束後、翌年開始時、再貼新花、經財政部魚電明白指示在案、</p>

<p>自十一月一日起、新印花由郵局發售後、所有檢查印花事宜、即改由各省市縣政府辦理、由各省印花煙酒稅局派員隨時抽查、其檢獲違反印花稅條例案件、則由當地司法機關處理、以前設立之審理印花稅事件委員會、亦已於十月底結束、惟上海租界檢查印花事宜、向由租界查緝處辦理、送由法院審理、自十一月一日起、仍照舊辦理、並不改變、</p>

<p>徵工開闢導淮入海水道開工紀念刋</p>
<p>— 陳果夫題</p>
<p>論著</p>
<h3 id="c200">江蘇徵工辦理導淮入海初步工程之動機 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 陳果夫</p>
<p>近百年來，本省淮域各縣，因歷次淮次泛濫，人民生命財產所蒙之損失，雖無精確統計足資考證，然而爲害之慘重，凡生長斯士與熟悉淮域掌故者，固盡人皆知，公私紀載，亦言之詳矣。遠者不具論，最近如民國二十年時，淮水暴漲，運灑東西隄決口不下四十處，里下河十餘縣，完全沈淪於洪水之中，單就農田收成與財產損失言，已無慮數萬萬元，而人畜田廬之犧牲，尚不與焉。夫以人謀之不盡，遂令江北數十縣人民，一遇淮水暴漲，即慓慓危懼，奔走駭汗，而仍束手無策，惟冀幸免茍全於萬一，寧非至可痛可之事乎。</p>
<p>當有清季世，淮安丁顯首倡導淮之議，其後南通張季直氏復闡發其說，一時有心之士，皆引起深切注意。惜因入海入江，路綫問題，爭持不決，加以政局多故，工艱欵鉅，多種關係，形成捍格，仍未能見諸實施。然導淮工程關係之重大，與社會一般心理要求之迫切，益彰彰明矣。民國十八年以來，中央特設導淮委員會，專司其事，並以黨國領袖爲之長，重視導淮工程，已可概見，經數年之研究探討，參酌前人擬議，博採社會輿論，更證之以實地之勘測，始決定江海分疏之大計，在工程計畫方面，可謂業已告一段落，祇須工欵籌措有著，即不難大舉興工矣。</p>
<p>導淮工程，雖關係魯預皖蘇四省，然魯豫皖三省，均居上游，導淮不成，不過洩水稍欠暢旺耳。本省則適當淮河尾閭，承受三省水量，水無去路，遂不得不以淮域數十縣膏腴之地，盡作上游三省洪水屯集之所，爲害之鉅，寧可勝言。導淮委員會爲策百年大計，規劃自須宏遠，在全部經費未有著落以前，大舉興工，不免尚需時日，惟本省江北各縣民生問題，關係至鉅，斷難再緩，此不得不先自辦理入海初步工程，以期早除禍患者一也。</p>
<p>本省夙稱東南財賦之區，物產豐富，商務殷繁，乃近年以來，水旱迭乘，工商交困，農村經濟日趨破產，伏莽潛滋，流亡載道，其重要原因，實由水利失修，而江北導淮未成，尤爲癥結所在，及今不圖，後患何已，去歲到蘇之始，即惄焉深憂，認爲完成導淮，爲救濟江北民生急要之工作。同時並以導淮工程，需欵千萬元以上，非本省目前財力所能勝任，因有徵工辦理入海初步工程之擬議。第用民之力，雖有古訓，而工程過大，能否推行順利，尚覺疑信參半。及本年春，微工修浚六塘河，賴沿河各縣民衆力役相從，士紳同心恊助，卒能如期完成，因知淮域民衆固大可有爲，此毅然採取徵工辦法辦理導淮入海初步工程者二也</p>
<p>論者或謂導淮工程，關係國家大計，非中央不能負此重任，而工艱欵鉅，尤非中央之力，不足以竟其全功。本省正當財用拮據之際，不必勉竭民力，枝節爲之，余謂不然，導淮以救濟民生爲前提，責任固屬中央，利益則仍在地方，中央以國難嚴重，雖感覺籌措鉅欵之匪易，但亦利用庚欵，經已興工如張福河之初步工程，完成淮陰邵伯劉澗三閘正在建築，三河壩工之籌備，運河西堤之修整等工程之費可千百萬元，若再以本省地方民力財力，補助中央所不逮，合力進行，對中央係屬恊助性質，在本省仍不失爲自救之謀，內外相維，合力並舉，則績效易覩，而成功可期也。</p>
<p>抑余更有渴望者，導淮工程，關係四省，本省地居下游，上游三省，雖無以鄰爲壑之心，而本省因承受三省之水，迭遭昏墊，創痛比較爲鉅，今本省以迭承災䘲之餘。民竊財困，已忍痛負重，先自辦理導淮入海初步工程矣，尤願上游三省，侭力恊助，中央主持機關，加以領導，俾大工得以早觀厥成，不禁拭目俟之矣！</p>
<h3 id="c201">籌辦開闢導淮入海初步工程之經過 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 沈百先</p>
<p>淮本獨流入海，列爲四凟之一。自神禹導治以後，歷三千餘年不變。迨五代北宋以降，貢河南決，淮始受病。元明之際，賈魯塞決，劉大夏築太行隄，淮遂見奪於河，望門投止，以洪澤高寶爲逆旅，以自運東閘壩分入江海爲歸墟，於是淮揚之間，望門投止，以洪澤高寶爲逆旅，以自運東閘壩分入江海爲歸墟，於是淮揚之間，淮禍迭見，至今未已。咸豐五年，河決銅瓦廂，北徒而復千乘故道，導淮之議，隨之而起。山陽丁西圃先生首爲之倡，有識之士，紛紛應和。光宣之際，南通張季直先生，主張尤力；迨及民國，創設江淮水利測量局，後改導淮測量處，由民元施測至民十五，成績最著。先總理建國方略，更認導淮爲刻不容緩之舉。二中全會，秉承遺敎，復有依已往十八年之調查成績，實施浚治之決議。中央旋即特設導淮委員會，期於尅期完成，以除淮禍，以奠民生。綜觀七八十年來，國人殫精畢慮，以謀導淮之實現者，可謂勤劬備至；然而長爲工費所困，遂致空言無補。茲者百先追隨陳主席之後，忝掌蘇省建設，受任以後，即奉命籌辦徵工辦理導淮入海初步工程，竊喜國人最渴望之事可見實現，刻因籌備業已就緒，大工即日開始，謹述籌辦經過，以爲工程開始之紀念。</p>
<p>導淮工作，經導淮委員會竟盡數年之心力，斟酌各方之意見，測勘研究，始確定江海分疏之原則。入海水道，係由張福河經廢黃河至套子口入海。原計劃底寛一百二十公尺，隄距三百五十公尺，需欵三千四百餘萬元。工大費鉅，斷非省府財力所能勝。乃於上年先行征工疏浚六塘河，以爲導淮工程之準備與嘗試。竟賴民衆之踴躍應征，士紳之踴躍恊助，結果異常美滿。於是確知淮域父老昆季，洞明事理，凡屬利害切身之事，必能見義勇爲，勞而無怨；此征工辦理導淮入海工程之所由決定也。</p>
<p>本年五月，本廳即有導淮入海第一期工程兩年計劃之擬議，其河綫係由張福河循廢黃河槽至七套離廢黃河由套子口入海，全長約一百七十二公里，兩隄距離爲三百五十公尺，除河底寛度由一百二十公尺，減爲三十五公尺外，一切仍照導淮會原計劃辦理。計需開挖土方六千六百六十餘萬公方，築隄土方五百餘萬公方，均用征工辦理。爲體念工作計，仍按方酌給伙食費，計需六百八十餘萬元。至於楊莊周門兩處活動壩，需欵一百零六萬元，則仍由導淮會擔任，以期分工合作，蓄洩兼資。</p>
<p>本年六月，六塘河工程，既告完竣，即淮導淮委員會咨請分令所屬有關各縣，征工繼續開聞導淮入海水道。原咨略謂：</p>
<p>開聞入海路綫，最近由本會須總工程師商得貴省政府建設廳沈廳長同意，採用疏浚六塘河征工辦法，分令有關各縣，征工繼續開闢自淮陰楊莊經廢黃河七套至套子口入河征工辦法，分令有關各縣，征工繼續開闢自淮陰楊莊繼廢黃河七套至套子口入海工程。其開工之前，亟應組織施工測量隊，釘定河綫，詳測土方，以爲分配各縣征工之標準。此項測隊外業經費，及一應員工儀器，均由本會籌備。其疏浚工程與築隄工程，及其他關於工程方面所必需之設備，應請貴省政府征工辦理，用符合作，期減沈災。云云。旋即將本案提經省府委員會第六六九次會議，決議原則通過。經咨復導淮委員會，除征工事宜，即由本省著手籌備外，其測量事宜，請即迅速實施，以利進進。</p>
<p>本年七月初，準導淮會咨爲入海水道測量隊即日出發，請飭屬保護，經分令沿河各縣妥實遵照，並會同保安處分令沿河各縣軍警，聽憑測量隊商調，以期周妥。</p>
<p>本年八月，本省以籌辦導淮入海，開闢新運河，辦理旱災工振等項，需欵孔殷，呈奉中央核準發行水利建設公債二千萬元，以六百萬元，撥充征工導淮入海工程之用。導淮工程最難解決之經費問題，至是亦圓滿解決。</p>
<p>本年九月，測量行將告竣，開浚工程，急待實施。乃擬具江蘇省導淮入海工程處及段工程事務所組織規程草案，並爲格外慎重起見，請由省府聘任導淮會總工程師爲顧問工程師，隨時指導辦理，提經省府委員會第六九一次會議。決議，聘函照辦，規程修正通過。又決議派許心武爲江蘇省導淮入海工程處處長，陳和甫爲副處長，戈涵樓爲總工程師。均經分別由省政府函聘令委。工程處定十月一日在淮陰成立，定期開工。一面飛電淮陰淮安漣水阜寧等四縣將廢黃河南隄一律修築平整，俾可行駛汽車，以利工事，限十月十日以前完竣。並分令江北各縣查報出產蘆蓆數量價格，以便購作搭棚住之用。同時省政府復分令淮陰鹽城兩區行政督察專員兼任導淮入海工程督察委員；淮陰淮安漣水阜寧泗陽陽鹽城寶應高郵興化東臺江都泰縣等十二縣縣長兼任工程處征工委員。並分令上列各縣，應征民伕人數，限期征集，聽候調造分配。</p>
<p>本年十月二日，會同財政廳分別擬具導淮入海工程處及段工程事務所二十四個月經常費預算，提經省府委員會第六九三次會議修下通過。十月八日，十六日，會同民政廳兩次召集淮陰等十二縣縣長來省開會，討論征伕進行事宜，訂定工伕管理辦法等項。頒發征伕獎懲規則，及昭告民衆書。時工程處已先於十月一日，如期成立，開始工作。所有原頒工程計劃，經工程處復加審核，認爲按照標準斷面，出土距離過遠，萬難做倒。擬將原計劃兩隄距離三百五十公尺，減爲二百三十公尺，平均出土距離爲一百二十二公尺，較原計劃減短百分之三十二，工作人數日期，方可與規定符合，而於宣洩量並無影響。經咨轉導會核準辦理。於是倡議七八十年之導淮入海工程，經半年之籌備，乃決於中華民國二十三年十一月一日實行開工矣。</p>
<p>抑百先猶有不能已於言者，導淮入海工程，依照導淮委員會原計劃，共需工費三千四百萬元，即此次初步工程計劃，茍非征工辦理，亦需一千六百萬元。茲乃毅然以六百萬元之欵，興一千六百萬元之工。此固由於淮禍之煎迫，不容遲回猶豫；而六塘河工美滿之成績，亦有以鼓舞而策進之也。六塘河所成之工，估計值百萬元，省府籌欵三十六萬元，僅當全部工費十三；其餘十之五，則爲工伕之勞力；又十之二，則爲士紳恊助之功。今導淮工程，省府所籌六萬元，已趨過原定一千六百萬元十之三；其餘十之六七，諒地方父老昆季爲㧞除多年之宿疾隱患以謀一勞永逸長治久安計，必能忍痛掙扎，勉爲其難，與政府通力合作，上下一體；則預定二年完工，可操左券。將來工程完竣，淮海通流，高岸深槽，散濁揚清，十年數十年之後，駸駸以復其故。其效果之當超越初步工程所預期：而此初步工程之發軔，乃彌足動人回憶而增益紀念之價值矣！</p>

<h3 id="c202">江蘇省徵工開闢導淮入海初步工程兩年計劃原案 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>導淮委員會自民國十八年成立以後。幾經測勘設計，說究得失，始決定以江海分疏爲原則。所有全部導淮計劃之綱要及入海水道之計劃。均經先後公佈。其入海水道最後決定由張福河經廢黃河至套子口入海，全長約一百七十二公里。河底寛度一百二十公尺。兩堤距離三百五十公尺。共需經費三千四百二十六萬九千一百元。旋以需費孔多。不易籌措。又有分期實施之規劃。其第一期工程，除河底寛度由一百二十公尺減爲三十五公尺外一切仍照原計劃未曾更動。但仍需工欵一千六百萬元。終以工大欵鉅。迄未實現。</p>
<p>溯自黃河北徒。淮不復故。吾蘇省適當淮河尾間。幾於十年九災。民不聊生。故蘇省地方人士。深望此入海水道。早日完成。以減江北陸沉之痛。導淮委員會目前既以初期整理中運及里運工程。正在積極進行，而入海工程所需經費又非常浩大。深感籌欵爲難。本省政府爲促成導淮入海工程早日寶現計爰擬與導淮委員會合作援照修浚六塘河徵工辦法。以期速成，並體念伕工生活之不易。仍擬由省勉籌巨欵。按方酌給伙食，藉維伕工生計。俾可安心工作。共襄盛舉。</p>
<p>（二）計劃概要</p>
<p>按照導淮委員會計劃原定路踐。本極完善。即以殷家渡至交陵集間之裁灣取直需言。不特土方減少。洩量亦以降度較陡而增多。効益至爲明顯，惟裁灣取直附近。地勢低窪。堤身過高。夯硪工作。非徵工所能勝任。稍一不慎。勢將重遭倒堤潰決之禍。故不得不酌予變通。仍循廢黃河舊槽。至七套以下。仍照導淮委員會原計劃綫。逕由套子口入海，以省工費。</p>
<p>本計劃斷面，仍照導淮會計劃。依照開浚張福河初步工程於廢黃河漕中關一底寛三十五公尺之水道。以洩洪流，洪湖水位在十五公尺時河水深七。五公尺，兩懌堤頂高出洪水位一。五公尺，堤距三百五十公尺，楊莊又周門二處各建活動壩一座。洪澤湖與楊莊之水位差爲一。四公尺。楊莊活動壩水頭損失○。二五公尺，楊莊壩下之水位爲一三。三五公尺，海口水位一。五公尺，周門活動壩水頭損失○。二五公尺。故楊莊壩下至海口水面總降落爲一一，六公尺。本計劃因循廢黃河舊槽而行。路綫略較紆週。計共長一六八五九公里。故水面比降爲○。○○○○六八八。</p>
<p>用偉希鄉滿氏（Ｆorcbhe,mer）公式計算流量</p>
<p>式中河床糙率系數（n）用○。○二二五，得流量與洪澤湖水位之關係如下：</p>
<p>洪澤湖水位　河床寛度　比降　流速　流量</p>
<p>由上表可知洪澤湖水位在十五公尺時，流量爲每秒四五五立方公尺。查民國十年廢黃河最大流量爲每秒一八三立方公尺。其時楊莊水位爲一五。一九公尺。民國二十年廢黃河每秒最大流量爲三三九立方公尺。其時楊莊水位爲一五。八二公尺。又查楊莊水位在一三，○公尺以下，廢黃河即無出水量。以此與上表相較。即可見開挖之功效矣。倘洪澤湖口三河活動壩完成以後。洪澤湖平常水位均有一三。五公尺。在大水未發以前。入海水道自可先行侭量下淺。湖水預爲局部騰空。洪澤湖既多此分洩水道。其盈漲之進行自緩，遠到最高峯之機會亦少。無形中減輕洪澤湖之負擔亦即無形中縮短洪水峯之時間。是三河活動壩完成後。入海水道之効用將益見顯著也。（路綫參看平面圖）</p>
<p>廢黃河河床，本以沙土居多。挖深以後。水盡充足或可由水力衛刷日漸擴大則事半功倍，尤見經濟。</p>
<p>（三）土方估計</p>
<p>本度劃土方之計算。係根據民國十年淮揚徐海平剖面測量局實測地形圖及廢黃河床縱剖面圖。共取橫斷面六十九個。爲簡捷計，每一斷面河床及兩岸酌取三點，平均計算其開挖深度，築隄地點亦參酌兩岸地勢平均計算其築隄高度。此種計算，容或與實際情形，稍有出入，然大體不致相差過遠勉。可用爲約估工費及分配工段之根據一俟施工時。自當再加詳測並復估之。</p>
<p>全河共計開挖土方六六。六○六，三一一公方，築隄土方五○三六。○九○公方，所有隄工。一律利用挖土堆築，暫不加礎。（土方計算表略）</p>
<p>（四）施工辦法</p>
<p>導淮委員會原計劃內在楊莊及周門兩處，各建活動壩一座。擬仍由導淮委員會建築。所有開挖築隄土方，概由本省微工辦理，全部工程期以二年完成。俾可與導淮委員會二年施工計劃。同時告竣。</p>
<p>周門活動壩之建築，完全爲節制水量。抬高水位，以供阜寧一帶之灌溉水量。目前里下河以東航運灌溉，導淮委員會一時尚未能與辦。則周門活動壩如經費據拮，目可暫緩建築，惟楊莊活動壩因欲操縱洪澤湖水位。保持運河水源。必須提前舉辦。故在施之功，楊莊擬留二百五十公尺暫不開挖。作建築活動壩壩基。並防運水流入。至於海口切灘工程，擬在第二年辦理。</p>
<p>所有工伕，概由沿淮有關各縣徵集。茲爲管理便利起見。每一縣組成一段，一律住宿工次，就近工作，在實施之前。依照各縣應徵工伕之多寡，計算應做土方。復按兩年共攤土方數量，劃成工段。指定地界，已劃之工段。即責令該縣在二年期內完成，各縣人候。既可不致混雜。責職自專，工作地點又可母須遷移，効率亦大。</p>
<p>茲爲求全部工程一律並便於技術人員指導起見。再規定施工辦法十三條藉資遵守。</p>
<p>第一條　河綫應侭量採取平直，不得曲成銳角，如因地勢必不得已時。至少須有半徑一公里之曲綫。</p>
<p>第二條　提綫趨向，應與河流平行。並憲取不受當地流行暴風直射侵害之方向。</p>
<p>第三條　河底寛暫定爲三十五公尺，河坡一律爲一比二·五。</p>
<p>第四條　兩岸堤距規定爲三百五十公尺，堤頂寛度四公尺。堤坡一律爲一比三。</p>
<p>第五條　開挖河土。一律利用堆築堤身。</p>
<p>第六條　如遇舊堤母需培修或挖土有剩餘之處，應將剩餘挖土。堆填堤外。幫寛堤腳。</p>
<p>第七條　培修舊堤除將坡面樹皮草根石塊除盡外。應切成階級樣子每磴高以三十公分爲度。與新土層層犬牙相錯。逐漸增高。</p>
<p>第八條　建築新隄，隄基內有樹根草皮石塊一切植物之枝葉，必須產除盡凈，不得稍有遺留。而層舊土，亦須先行爬鬆再加新土</p>
<p>第九條　挖河土料內所有樹枝草根，概須除凈</p>
<p>第十條　如挖河土料過劣，祗能利用填築隄心。堤頂坡面必須尋覓好土舖蓋。</p>
<p>第十一條　新堤基內如有舊時溪流。或崩土之痕跡。及因產除草根等而挖成之土穴。均應填塞堅實。</p>
<p>第十二條　舊堤上原有權洞竄穴。必須嚴密詳查。填塞堅實。</p>
<p>第十三條　渡口或過路，應修一比十五之路坡，如係新路。應使勿與堤身成直角。靠河方面，應令與水流回一方向下降。靠陸方面，應與水流，同一方向上升。</p>
<p>（五）施工期間之規定</p>
<p>全河開挖土方共計六六。六○六。三一一公方。規定二年完成。每年約須做三千三百餘萬公方。隄身利用挖土堆築。僅須稍事整理。母用大工。實微工伕十六萬人。分配十五段同時興工。兩岸隄距規定三百五十公尺，出土距離約有一百七十五公尺，每人每日以出土一公方半計，實做一百四十日即可竣工。另加雨雪及有特殊事故停工時間作七十日計，七個月可全部完成。</p>
<p>每年工程擬在水涸農隊時期舉行。預計每年九月一日組織工程處開始籌備。九月十日召集有關各縣縣長會議十月一日成立各段工程事務所。規定在十月十五日以前一律開工。所有施工測量劃配工段簽訂椿誌築壩戽水釐訂各項章則以及徵集工伕撐搭工棚等一應籌備事宜。統限十月十五日以前辦理就緒。十月十五日至次年五月三十一日爲實施工作時期。次年六月十日各段工程事務所結束。工程處六月底結束。當開始及結束時期人數不必用足。故經常費預算可以九個月計算。</p>
<p>（六）工伕之管理</p>
<p>此次徵工開浚廢黃河。人員編制方法，規。定各縣一律，最小單位爲分隊。每分隊一百人。設分隊長一人。合十分隊爲一隊。計工伕一千人。設隊長一人。每縣設總隊長一人統率之。分隊長及隊長由各縣政府委派區鄉鎮長兼任。總隊長由各縣政府建設局長或建設科長或主任科員兼任。各縣縣長爲微工專員。督率各隊長負一切徵工及管理工伕責任。所有徵工辦法。除參酌建設廳頒佈之各縣徵工浚河規程辦理外。茲將其工作範圍。規定如下。</p>
<p>一，查編徵工清冊</p>
<p>二，查編業戶壯丁及代金各項清冊</p>
<p>三，召集工伕</p>
<p>四，代雇工伕</p>
<p>五，編配工伕隊</p>
<p>六，率帶工伕到達工段</p>
<p>七，監督工伕到工退工時間及工作進行事宜</p>
<p>八，調查及報告逐日到工人數</p>
<p>九，辦理工伕衛生事宜</p>
<p>十，辦理警衛事宜</p>
<p>十一，辦理其他關於工伕管理事項</p>
<p>各縣總隊長隊長分隊長均需常川駐工。監督進行。</p>
<p>（七）工處之組織</p>
<p>爲寛施工程便利起見。擬設導淮入海工程處。處內設處長一人掌理處內一切事宜，主任工程師一人。工程師副工程師若干人。承處長之命。分掌局內一切事宜，佐理工程師若干人。在處長及主任工程師指導之下，分理監督及指導各段工作之進行。審核調查及比較各段工作之成績，呈報每週各段工作進行之狀況以及工具工段等分配事項，事務員會計員償員等若干人，分理之件之擬譯及繕錄，文卷之收發及保管工欵之保管及簿記，各員薪津之發給，以及預算算決之編造，處外設段工程事務所，分別辦理各工段事務，此次劃分工段不以縣境爲限，而以各縣徵工人數多少爲支配。每縣所攤之工段，內設事務所一所，共爲十二所，惟各縣伕工有多少地段有長短，工程有大小。故各所組織亦略有不同。其工程較大之工段，如爲淮陰淮安漣水鹽城阜寧等五縣所擔任者各設工程師兼段長一人。其餘工程較小之工段，僅設副工作師或助理工程師一人至二人。但由處長指定一人兼任段長，承處長之命掌理段內一切事宜，段內視工務之繁簡，設技術人員若干人。承受長之命，分理測量工段。監督指導工程之進行及研究統計實施工程之成績，事務員顧員若干人。分理會計文牘繕寫等事項，各縣工伕總隊長應在段事務所內辦公。並受各段段長之指揮。</p>
<p>（八）經費預算</p>
<p>開挖土方每公方津貼伙食費單價，暫以每公方八分計算。二年共計土方六六。六○六。三一一公方，需工費五百三十二萬八千五百零五元。外加海口切灘工程十萬元。共計土工費五百四十二萬八千五百零五元。</p>
<p>築壩及拆壩費每年估計爲三萬五千元，戽水費每年估計三萬元。全體工伕一律搭篷住宿。十人一篷。每篷材料費姑需四元五角計。每年搭篷費估計七萬二千元。每年工長約九十公里。每公里用跳板四十塊。每塊以五元計，共需一萬八千元。椿木繩尺及一切工用雜費每年估計一萬三千元。外加施工測量費每年約一萬元。共計設備設三十三萬八千元。</p>

<p>工程處及事務所經常費，每年以九個月預算，需費二十六萬四千八百五十五元。二年共需五十二萬九千七百十元。</p>
<p>預算費以預算總數百分之四計。二年約共需費二十四萬元。上項全部經費總計需銀六百八十一萬三千四百十五元。此外楊莊及周門兩處各建活動壩一座。約共需銀一百零六萬元。擬請導淮委員會撥欵興築。</p>
<p>按年應需各項經費列如附表。</p>
<p>查上列計劃。爲江蘇省建設廳本年五月間所擬原案。現當工程開始實施。已隨時稍有更改。特此註明。編者識</p>

<h3 id="c205">國貨新感想 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>中國人應用中國貨　何應欽先生日前參觀美亞織綢廠亞浦耳電器廠時，即席題中國人應用中國貨八字，這八個字，多麼乾脆，多麼爽利。誠然，是了中國人，當然要用中國貨，倘使做了一個中國人，專以服用洋貨是尚，那是自忘其爲中國人了。無論怎樣？我總是覺得他只有蓋恥，沒有光榮。再進一步中國人應造中國貨，中國人應販中國貨，這纔對得起自已，對得起祖宗，對得起社會，對得起國家。並願何先生回到華北，把這種情形，去鼓動一下。</p>
<p>真正國貨　一天聽盧志學先生說笑話他說：星期日到公園去走走，看見搖籃中臥著一位中國的未來主人翁，正在牙牙學語。盧君一看，搖籃是國貨公司出品，可是來看的人，大家都笑嘻嘻的徘徊不去，盧君仔細觀察，原來他們都望著這籃上的幾個大字發笑，搖籃上刻著四個大字，呌做真正國貨。啊喲真正國貨，這四個字，看似十分幽默，可是很可動人情感的。</p>
<p>主席是老主顧　國府主席林子超先生，童顏美髯，道貌可親，前天特赴中國國貨公司參觀，兼購國貨。一時園而觀者，肩庫踵接，都想一瞻主席風采。嗣晤經理方液仙李康年營業主任沈靜輝三君，纔知林主席不到上海則已，每到上海，必光臨公司一次。主席原來是公司的老主顧。主席而提倡國貨，愛用國貨，這樣來轉移風氣，影響習俗。很有效力。決不是尋常替人家揭幕趕趕熱鬧的可以同日而語。</p>
<p>湖南人的特性　友人陸君，出席長沙中國國貨公司，返滬備述長沙國貨公司之發達情形。他說，開幕那天，傾城婦女，都來購貨，店員應接不暇，連董事長譚前廳長，霍經理等，都親自出來交易，旁邊幾家販賣國貨的店舖，這天也多做了一二千元的生意。湖南人本是很剛毅的，很有骨氣的，他們最反對的是奸商，是販賣仇貨，聽說曾經殺死過幾個不要臉的奸商。所以有了國貨公司，當然是大家歡迎之至。</p>
<p>國貨獻議</p>
<h3 id="c206">國貨流動展覽獻議 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 南國勞人</p>
<p>—殷鹽不遠他山可錯—</p>
<p>近據華沙電訊：波蘭將於最近期內，派一展覧商船運載該國工農業出產品向遠東各國作一次實際有效的流動展覧。這條展覧商輪預定的路綫所要公開展覧的東方各商埠，爲坡賽，檳榔嶼，瑞天咸，新加坡，香港，上海，大連，橫濱等埠。</p>
<p>波蘭，是歐戰後復興國家之一，他在遠東似乎沒有商業地位可言。我們平常所服用的舶來品中，也很少見到,,Ｍade　in　　Warsaw"或是“made　in　poland"的。他們的航業，也尚未展驥足於遠東。可是他們爲推銷本國工農產品於海外的市塲起見，也就不惜工本，特派了商輪到遠東來作流動展覧的實際廣告。</p>
<p>我因此感想到我們的國貨界，單單在大門里頭呌喊著，展覧著，也還是不夠的。我們海外的華僑，單就近在咫尺的南洋羣島就有七八百萬，他們都歡迎著道地國貨的光臨。南洋各埠的商會，每欲舉行國貨大展覧，而苦於和國內國貨商素少聯絡，較有價值的國貨商品，來去寄運，又很麻煩，貨品太少，太平凡，展覧起來，規模既小，又不足以顯示地大物博的真象。所得的效果自然是不會宏大的。</p>
<p>十九年冬，筆者道過馬尼拉，那時匪列賓的華商正借著青年會舉行國貨展覧，事前籌備了四五個月，搜集貨品，煞費苦心，那天到展覧會里來參觀的，除了大羣的華僑外，有著不少的西人的夫婦們和菲列賓土著中有錢的人們。只可惜陳列的貨品連不多。</p>
<p>我那時便想著要是南洋各埠到處都能舉行大規模的國貨展覧，那對於國貨的向外發展定可收莫大的效益。不過這件事情，要完全期望於各當地的僑商，是不大容易辦到的。</p>
<p>目下辦內的國貨商已有了產銷合作的商業合理化的組織。倘使能夠取則於波蘭的專輸裝運國貨，向南洋馬尼拉，西貢，新加坡，檳城，仰光，日里棉蘭，巴城，泗水，山打根等處，環航一周，作大規模的流動展覧。我想比諸空口標示著國貨年，要切實有效得千萬倍呢</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c207">提倡國貨的總動員 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>去年的國貨年已行過去，今年的婦女國貨年快要完結，兩年來的成績怎樣？我卻不忍說而又不敢說，因爲海關統計表上明明的告訴我們說：今年九個月來，入超已有二億五萬多銀元了！</p>
<p>難道是提倡得未盡其力嗎？我看也未見得。因爲工商界奔走呼號，聲嘶力竟：智識界口誅筆伐，舌敝唇焦：還有些勢血志士，投彈警告，致陷囹圄也，也不乏其人。種了這般的因，獲得這殷的果。真令人感覺得滿眼悠悠，悉屬叔寶了！</p>
<p>感嘆是沒用的，還是起來掙扎。我們在這九死一生中，還得爲國貨作最後的努力。我現在想得幾個具體的辦法在后面，不知道能行不能行？寫出來和諸位討論一下：</p>
<p>（一）提倡國貨敎育　小學生是未來的主人翁，我們對於一般成年人深中了洋貨的毒害大半已認爲無可救藥的了，滿腔的希望，都著落在這般小國民身上。不過他們好像一方白布，染蒼則蒼，染黃則黃，此時不嚴加訓練，將來又要變成一個洋貨迷了。所以我們除了提倡德，列入日常標準生活的一項中。幼時做慣，長大也不致變節。十年敎訓，也許有意想不到的功效收穫咧。</p>
<p>（二）在上者以身則作　政府中煌煌訓今，提倡同貨。可是在上的人，不能以身作則，這訓令也有等於無。倘使地方上一個主要官員，他能說便能做，自已服用了國貨，漸漸的推及下僚屬吏，小民還敢不遵照的嗎？在民十年間，馮玉祥玉河南當督軍，他老人家是歡喜儉樸的，穿了布大襖。咬著硬饎，自已以身作則，不幾個月，開封城里竟找不到呈個綺羅遍體的人。把這事來作個例子，只要在上者提倡而又實行，不怕沒有成効。</p>
<p>（三）人民組織國貨十人國　有許多人購輞外貨，總是偷偷摸摸。良心未死絕，總覺著有些慚愧。這時只要有人一加勸阻，他自然的不去購買了。我們現在自動的組織一個服用國貨十人團，勸人民悉行加入，滿十人爲一隊，互相監察，互相勗勉。一人犯規，餘人檢舉，先則勸告，繼則懲戒，再不聽宣告大衆除名。羞惡之心，人皆有之。在這時人人服用國貨，而他偏自不用，一經除名，豈不要痛悔得沒地縫可鑽嗎！由一隊而十隊而百而千而萬，全國人民由變成了團員，外貨在我國還有立足之地嗎！</p>
<p>以上三項，希望政府中各官吏和敎育界中的知名人士提倡於前；各界響應於後。集全國人民的力量，作一次提倡國貨的大動員，國家富強，或許有幾分希望咧！</p>
<p>一週間國貨界新訊</p>
<p>（一）我國皮貨、本年出口激增、上半期已達二千三百餘萬元、繼絲茶躍居第一位、</p>
<p>（二）林主席於十月二十八日赴上海中國國貨公司參觀、軍政部長何應欽赴亞浦耳美亞康元等廠參觀、</p>
<p>（三）四川何北衡君、及重慶商會主席溫少鶴君、經濟委員會西北分會主任劉景山君、聯袂來滬、討論國貨推銷辦法、</p>
<p>（四）上海市商會電廣東省政府、致謝不徵國貨保護稅、</p>
<p>（五）雲南實業廳長繆嘉銘籌備之雲南國貨公司、定下月開幕、</p>
<p>（六）上海市社會局主辦之六屆國貨運動大會、定十一月十二日假南市蓬萊市塲舉行、</p>
<p>（七）上海市商會召集提倡國貨委員會、討論提倡國貨及分業展覧辦法、</p>
<p>（八）長沙國貨公司總經理霍又昌君來滬、接洽國貨推廣問題、</p>
<p>（九）先施公司在港主辦之第二次國貨展覧會、於十月三十一日開幕、</p>
<p>（十）國際貿易局訊、英荷兩國需要我國所產石墨、又德國需要錦苗銻灰鉛層碎錫等、特爲徵求此項礦商及出口商、以便接洽、</p>
<h3 id="c208">注意廉價舊書 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 江雲</p>
<p>最近市面上常常有廉價舊書出售，如紅樓，三國，水滸等小說，曾文正公家書，閱微草堂筆記等等。書用新聞紙印，洋裝，新式標點，印刷得很清楚，裝訂得也很美觀，價格之便宜，從來未有。大部份打一折，最多二折三折，全部紅樓夢，往常至少要化一塊錢左右買到，現在化二角錢就可以買來。最初我以爲這是不景氣的結果，和普通書局的大廉價一樣沒有什麼奇怪，但是市面上這種廉價舊書實在多的駭人，洋房大廈門前水門汀上也往往攤滿了這種廉價舊書出售，心中也不免有點懷疑。直到昨天，我看到香港寄來的香港工商的日報上面的一段廣州專訊，方才恍然大悟。這段專訊是這樣的：</p>
<h3 id="c209">廣州最近兩種劣貨傾銷 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>生菓與廉價書籍</p>
<p>我國自九一八事件發生，以迄東北國省淪亡之後，凡屬國人無不義憤填膺！諜曾幾何時，國內各處無不有敵貨之傾銷，幾至觸目皆是，致令外國人常時恥笑我國人民五分鐘熱度之譏，朗可慨也。近查敵貨傾銷，在廣州方面新近佔有市塲地位者，其一則爲臺灣之生菒，以金山橙，蘋果，龍牙蕉三項爲最多，此種菓類屬於敵貨者，乃爲本市從前所不多見，惟至今年則特別傾銷，其數目亦不菲。其一則爲廉價書籍，此種書籍完全由劣貨洋紙所印成，聞劣紙自滯銷後，敵人即勾通奸商將所有我國舊書小說而無版權者一律翻印，用一二折價格平賣，故此種劣紙書籍，銷路甚廣，其數目亦可驚人云。</p>
<p>原來不家這樣的黑幕！</p>
<p>中國舊書，沒有版權，於是日人就用翻印舊書的方法來推銷他們滯銷的紙張，怪不得賣得這樣便宜，原來他們只救收回紙張成本！</p>
<p>他們的方法可真是又巧妙，又毒辣！我們知道他們會把他們的商品印上中國國貨的商標來賣給中國人，他們不但製造我國中產階級以上所用的貨品，並且製造鄉下老百姓所用的貨品，（好像鄉下人吃飯用的青花粗大碗，日本也製造了銷到中國來。）現在他們又玩這一套新花樣！</p>
<p>外國人的鬼心眼兒是無孔不入的，我們應當怎樣加緊築起我們的隄防來！</p>
<h3 id="c210">國貨與舞場 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 導溱</p>
<p>農村破產的呼聲，甚囂塵上，都市里享樂的建設，確是畸形的發展；十里洋塲的滬地，近數年來，歌臺舞榭，鱗次櫛比，城開不夜，性的誘惑，如癡如狂，肉的追求，若癩若瘋：在這里，縱目一視，男男女女，花枝招展，男的是西裝革履，司丹康美髪霜醮得光可鑑人，四七一一香水灑得香氣芬芳，顧影翩翩，純是一派揮金如土的公子哥兒：女的是捲髪，高跟鞋，口紅，胭脂，香粉，鳩娜之姿，嬌柔之態，十足地顯露著是一個矜恃著青春賣弄風騷的可人兒。</p>
<p>可以說一句，凡在這里的男男女女，他們的衣食住行，靡不沾染洋氣，習上歐風，純粹是仇貨洋貨主要的顧客，忠實的推銷員，要半他們來提倡服用國貨，簡直是風馬牛不相及哩！</p>
<p>不過，話又講回來了，提介國貨，本非極短時間可以奏效，服用國貨，若是男男女女大家來革除一切歐化服御品，絕不西裝革履，絕不油頭粉面，一致奮勇起來做一個提倡土布跳舞提倡儉樸跳舞的首創者，我想能夠如此的登高一呼，衆山咸應，所收之移風易俗的宏效，奚止倍蓰？</p>
<p>因爲坊間流行之時髦服裝，普遍行銷之化妝香品，大半是歌女舞星們服用之於先，一般極好虛榮好時髦的女性，仿效於後，凡是一種物品的去求，服裝式樣的翻新，更是大半由於歌女舞星們作典型，所以提倡國貨也要從歌臺舞榭間著手者，正是想利用其浩大之移風易俗的魔力，來作一次婦女國貨年中最後的運動罷了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求㥶工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>程志前看他滿懷躊躇的神氣，真是答復不好，不答復也不好。手伸至袋里去探索了一會，作個取煙捲的樣子，心里只管沉吟著。其實他並不抽煙，借了這個猶豫的機會，好想出話來說罷了。許久，他想出一句話了，笑道：我也是到西安不久的人，對於這里的情形，不大熟悉。不過我想著，西安城里窮人也很多，若是家里沒有男人，就應該把姑娘找婆婆家當是出路嗎？譬如像你這位大嫂，給人洗洗衣服，賣點力氣不一樣也是可以吃飯嗎？你到小西天去替姑娘找人家，那是錯了的，那里全是外路來的人，無根無底，將姑娘許配這種人，但顧了目前，到以後要怎麼樣呢？程志前說的這些話，自已覺得入情入理。可是胡嫂子聽著，簡直每個字都有些扎耳朶。可是自已反人家讓了來了，決不能將話來沖犯，只好笑道：程老爺也說得是，不過各也有各的苦處。程志前分明知道他是不願意，這倒也無所謂自已的目的，只是要看窮人的家庭而已。這就站起來笑道：好罷，我在西安還有些時候住呢，將來有要我幫忙的時候，我再幫忙就是了。我只願意看看你們寒苦人家是怎樣一個情形，你們屋子里讓我看看，可以嗎？胡嫂子心想，這位姑娘，由小西天前院到後院，再到家里，真讓你瞧了一個夠，你還要睢嗎？只要你肯睢，那就好辦，於是笑道：我們這樣一個破家，就怕你不肯瞧，你若是願意瞧，那就是我們的救星了。請看罷。說著，他就把那兩扇木板門，順手向屋子里推了一推，這就算是引讓客進去的意思。（五四）</p>
<h3 id="c250">記環遊世界之一老翁 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>甫過中年，即已視茫茫，髪蒼蒼，齒牙動搖，老態龍鍾者，環顧國中，蓋不乏其人也。今以週遊世界之一老翁觀之，不益有感於中外人士，體格之不同，何若斯之甚耶？老翁裘里斯勃立特朋君，蓋今之麥考保羅也。裘君年六歲時，即嘗隨其家人，作長途旅行。今則年逾七十依然老興不淺，其遊蹤可已行抵檳榔嶼矣。氏爲美國南加州人，年已七十有有六，曩曾經營股票業，嗣於二十年前退休以來，年必旅行，未嘗或輟。此番清遊，蓋係第十五次週遊世界。氏雖鬚髪如銀，但精神殊矍鑅，至其步履之健，與衷心之歡欣愉快，尤可使人一望而知。說者以爲世間年齡最老之青年，與旅程最遠及最樂觀者，當非裘氏莫屬，氏之老而彌健，即此可以想見。氏此次環遊，係搭乘大來公司之嘉斐爾總統號，有見之於檳榔嶼者，詢以旅行感想：則曰：總計余所歷途程，不下百萬英里，所費已達十數萬金。余深信世間最能使人長壽，與青春永駐者，當無過於旅行。今後余將繼續旅行，必待死而後已。計余足跡現所未經之處，僅西比利亞及冰島，料在不久之將來，當能實踐余之願望，前往一遊。至於哩程，總計當遠二百餘萬英里，余年七十有六，垂垂老矣。然自信少年豪興，不減曩昔，且每喜且少年人爲伍，並仍能游泳跳舞，凡此蓋皆旅行所賜。惟旅行乃真能使人年青而富朝氣，目下凡百進步感舒暢，且所費亦較三年前省卻一半，余殊願世人記取旅行之樂。以享身心方面之無上愉快也。</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>眉生眼上，其作用一爲防止額上的汗流入眼中，與睫毛相同；一則眼必須得著眉的扶助，方能顯出它的威儀。故由前之說，眉彷彿是眼的衛兵，沒有了它，眼便要受額汗的欺侮；由後之說，眉又似眼的上客，沒有了它，光剩一個主人—眼—是不能成禮儀的。</p>
<p>眉既有助於眼，我們理應把它好好保護才是，不圖近今摩登女子，竟肯忍心把它剃而去之。剃去了，又覺得光光的大不好看，於是再把它畫成兩條細狹的，修長的，望之似是而非。唉！衛兵已撤。上客雖留，然亦名存而實亡。這不能說不眉的厄運了。</p>
<p>考之於古，剃眉之風，唐朝也曾經盛行過的。宋王讜所撰的唐語林里有一則云：長慶中，京城婦人首飾，有以金碧珠翠，笄櫛步搖，無不具美，謂之百不知。婦人去眉，以丹紫三四橫約於目上下，謂之血曇妝。按古時的京妝，猶之現在上海的時妝，是最漂亮不過，也摩登不過的。就眉而論，所謂宮眉，常爲古人時詞中所引用，其例不勝舉。觀唐語林所載，當時婦女的愛好摩登，可見一斑。首飾只求其具美，不惜盡力以求之，故曰百不知。至於把眉去掉，而於眼的上下，橫畫以丹紫三四，想來也未必十分漂亮。血暈妝的名兒，衡以識緯之學，尤覺不詳得很。近今秦腔花旦的雙目上下，似乎還畫有細條兒，這或者就是唐時血暈妝的遺法罷。</p>
<p>畫眉深淺入時無。這可以證明眉在古時人就把它看似臉上的重要妝飾。可是這是指補天然的眉的缺陷而說。現在眉既遭著厄運，睫毛有知，當亦要歎它自已所負的使命是太重大了。</p>

<p>— 周子欣</p>
<p>生活的驅迫，和故鄉—崑山—很疎遠，淡漠，自已親近的家園，反變成了客地，那樣的久別，這是一回多麼的痛心事啊！在清靜的時候，雖則時常的在回味，故鄉是值得留戀，但，回味還是回味，事實上就是心和願逮，反而添加些苦痛罷了。</p>
<p>記得，那時是和故鄉還沒有離別，每天早上，就單獨的踱上麵館，盡量地把鴨麵啖食，當時也沒有什麼特別的印象</p>
<p>從和故鄉生疎以後，聽人的贊頌，和自已親自的嘗試：纔轉變著先前的存見，故鄉的鴨麵，確乎超越那一般的市售的鴨麵，鮮，糯，肥，廉，這就是特徵，受一般的稱許，也許就是這個起因吧</p>
<p>故鄉的鴨麵，首屈一指的，就要推那大街左近宣化坊的隆順館；他們的麵，是較一般的來得糯和細，他們的鴨，較一般的肥嫩，底和面，祇需銅元二十八枚，就可試嘗這美味可口的鴨麵，其他的館子，在百花街，半山橋堍，似乎是較隆順館稍遜一籌了。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后的鸞與既已安置好之後，我們便得趕快走進宮去，把我們原是陪駕東幸的隨從的地位，一變而爲留在奉天宮內，恭候聖駕的留守人員。—說破了真是極可笑的—這里所說的我們，並不只是指點我們八個女官而言，連光緒，隆裕，和瑾妃都一起包括在內；因爲他們對於太后，一般也是處於臣下的地位上啊—我們雖然必須先進宮去，但不能從正中那扇大門而入，而且是不許乘轎的；於是我們都紛紛從轎子里走下來，讓光緒率領著，魚貫似的打那左邊的一扇較小的門洞里走進去。一進去，先是看見一片很廣大的庭院，但我們的接駕禮，卻並不能就在這一個庭院內舉行；我們便穿過了它，走進了第二個同樣大小的庭院，再從這第二個庭院，走到第三個庭院，這個庭院的面積，是更大了，比是先的一個，約莫大出一倍，我們就在這庭院里歇住了，準備接接駕。</p>
<p>我們走進來的時候，已將那宮中原有的一班古樂隊，和袁世凱所借給太后的一班西樂隊全帶進來了；但爲習慣所拘束，西樂隊當然是不能在這種正式的典禮中演奏的，所以我們便只依舊借重那一班可厭的古樂隊。</p>
<p>這時候，在各個庭院里，以及每一座宮殿之中，已早有許多太監分佈在那里執役了。這些太監，有一半是向來留守在這里的；其餘的一大半，都是當太后未啟程以前，給李蓮英預先打發來灑掃殿宇，收拾花木，並準備一切應用的東西，以便太后和我們到來的時候，不致於供應不周。（一六四）</p>

<h3 id="c255">關於奴才 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 靈芝</p>
<p>我雖然家里定著一份申報，春秋攔里的文字也是天天看的；但是因爲事冗的關係，並不篇篇都看，即如甚感興趣的御香縹緲錄，也是有時看有時不看的。所以御香縹緲錄敘袁世凱觀見太后時自稱奴才既未看到，幾天後一段附啟文字，說有某君投函糾正，清制漢官應自稱臣云云，也未看到。可是易生君的一篇前清的奴才卻看到了。因一則易生君所講的頗有缺漏，二則乎頭恰好有現存的材料，所以就乘便把這稱謂問題，來說一下。</p>
<p>（一）滿員自稱奴才乃是滿洲舊體</p>
<p>乾隆二十三年二月壬申上諭軍機大臣等云，滿洲大臣……請安謝恩尋常摺奏，仍稱奴才，以存滿洲舊體。</p>
<p>要觀此，可知滿員自稱奴才，乃是滿洲人向來的體制，並不是洪承疇新定的。</p>
<p>（二）滿員也不是都稱奴才的</p>
<p>同一上諭里說：滿洲大臣奏事，稱臣稱奴，字樣不一，著傳諭嗣復頒行公事摺奏稱臣，請安謝恩尋常摺奏仍稱奴才。……</p>
<p>觀此，則滿員的稱臣稱奴才，看摺奏的性質而別，並不是一例稱奴才的。但是，這只是指文官而言，武官並不如此。</p>
<p>（三）滿漢官員會奏公事，以首衛人之稱謂爲稱謂。</p>
<p>乾隆三十五年閏五月丁犯諭軍機大臣等云，今日周元理會同西寧等奏到搜捕蝗孽一摺，……摺內列名處，西寧達翎阿則稱奴才，周元理則稱臣，殊覺可笑。臣僕本屬一體，均係奉上之稱，字義雖殊，其理則一。滿漢臣工自稱固有不同，然遇部院章奏，雖滿洲大員亦一例稱臣，而滿洲督撫奏地方公事亦然，並非以奴才之稱爲卑而近，稱臣爲尊而遠也。……而奏摺列銜，則不宜參錯，止當論首銜何人，或滿或漢，皆可以一貫之。此次三人會奏之摺，而寧名列在前，既稱奴才，則達翎周元理自當連名直寫，又何事妄生區別其間耶？……</p>
<p>然而在另一上諭里，說法卻又與此不同。</p>
<p>（四）滿漢官員會奏公事，應一例稱臣。</p>
<p>乾隆三十八年十一月戊申上諭內閣，本日御史天保馬人龍奏監考敎習查出代倩之弊一摺，……摺內書銜，因天保在前，遂概稱奴才。向來奏摺，滿官率稱奴才，漢官率稱臣。此不過相沿舊例，……初非稱奴才即爲親近而盡敬，稱臣即爲自疏而失禮也。……嗣後凡內外滿漢諸會奏公事，均著一體稱臣，以昭盡一，著爲令。</p>
<p>周元理因不肯跟著滿洲人稱奴才而遭申飭，馬人龍又因跟著滿洲人稱奴才而受指斥，真所謂跋前寒後，動輒得咎了！</p>
<p>（五）漢人亦有獻媚而自稱奴才者</p>
<p>乾隆三十八年十一月戊申上諭，指誅馬人龍自稱奴才，說明對於稱臣稱奴才的從不稍存岐視，就是爲的無知之徒，或因爲獻媚而自稱奴才，不可不防其漸。乾隆三十五年閏五月丁卯的上諭，也說明奴才與臣並無分別，於此等事從不計較，即漢人中間有於召對時稱奴才者，亦並無嘉賞之意。從漢人中間有於召對時稱奴才者一句話里看出，照例漢人雖不必稱奴才，然而漢人中卻很有自願做奴才的！</p>

<p>— 賈植芳</p>
<p>聽說有人要著手譯高爾基全集。這消息，驟聽之下，頗使人驚佩。</p>
<p>中國的譯人，在過去說，多半是小販，雖然有人也曾捲起袖子來幹了某一外國作家的全集，可是就印出來的幾冊說，有些地方譯得是連娘家也沒有了，杜格㵩湼夫的幾大名著（當然不是全集）有譯本，有的似乎還有兩個，好壞勿諭，總算竟了全功。托爾斯太，對於文學有點眉目的，全都知道這個名字，可是一直到現在，他的Ｍar　and　Peace）還沒有全部的譯本呢！郭哥理的巡按等算有人譯了，然而他的最大著作死掉的農奴（Ｄead　soul）還沒緣和這方塊字握手呢！無怪鼻子的譯者許遐先生要說較文明的國家都有譯本的話，渴望著譯本的青年，對翻譯界的這種零販政策的抱怨，甚而有超於許遐先生。</p>
<p>這是其。一</p>
<p>更滑稽的是有外國名著，卻是祇被介紹過來一個名字，其中如西萬提斯（Ｃervantes）底唐。吉訶德（Ｄan　Quixote）雖然被本國的作家在自已文章里左拉右引，像阿氏一樣的嘴熟。然而本書，好像至今，還沒有一個譯本出來。</p>
<p>我們的翻譯界，先前曾有一個洪水汎濫時代，不過到了近兩年以來，譯本少見，近乎沉寂了。不過，最近據說翻譯界又要振作起來了，單就雜誌說，譯文當其首，世界文學殿其後，這自然是可喜現象。</p>
<p>記得我與文學中有顧仲彝先生的一篇我對於翻譯的意見，顧先生的意見，撮其要，是要一些治翻譯的人對翻譯要有個整個計畫，現在有人譯高爾基全集之類，總算是一個滿意的答覆。</p>
<p>我也有個意見，可不像顧先生的整個計畫，說起來，渺小得很，我只希望譯人們能將一些作家在作品里引用過的一些未譯的作品譯過來，這呌還賬，因爲我們的作者指導青年學習的方法，有的是，呌到坊間購一冊文學史之類的書，檢其中，各派各代表作家之代表作來讀；有的只範統的說，從外國作家學習；有的則提起筆，刺刺不休地的開一個最低限度的文學書目。然而，一句話；坊間文學史上所說的各派各作家各代表作，或開出來的最低書目，對一些學習青年的功用，至多是示威一次，沒有別的。</p>
<p>在現代中國，一些文學青年，十之八九是不大闊氣，他們讀一些外國書，是像吃天鹅肉那麼難，這是指會打洋話的一部說的；至於不是學校出身沒機會學通洋文而居然也想鬧鬧文學，如商店小職員工人之類的青年，當聽到作者底非從外國作家學習不可的談話或論文而撈不到該作家底作品譯本，這不是迎頭一盆冷水，給他們定了沒有文學資格的命嗎？</p>
<p>話扯的遠了，我們噪著需要多量的後備作家，而又不給他們糧食吃，或給一星半點的剩食，零食之類，當兵還要譁變呢，學文學的似乎還不這麼野，可是半路改行的是少不了，即或守節到底，而所產出來的作品本身，是面黃肌瘦，營養不足！</p>
<p>這是將來的危機，只要我們不承認文學是絕對某一些特別人物在象牙塔里玩弄的東西。</p>
<p>翻譯家有整個計畫做也罷，擇要著手也罷，然而且莫要像北平的早掛了幾年牌子的莎土比亞全集翻譯會，徒計願而不還願。不但此也，除開還願以外，我們還要請國內翻譯家們，暫莫開空頭支票！</p>

<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>林氏於最近入獄前，曾經說了些自負的話：自名爲是轉向勸誘人，轉向悔導師，比擬爲當年小林多喜二的克服機會主義時的恩師一般。</p>
<p>同時，在純文藝的境界里，起辱罵的聲音來，他罵轉向作家的無恥無良心，甚之比擬爲匪賊（雜誌）荒亂，這種義憤滿胸的氣概，的確頗惹注目。然而在反面看來，正在罵人爲轉向派的中村武幕夫，自已也從藝術派里，隨到大衆文學的道里來了（請注意，日本的大衆文藝與中國不同，日本的大衆文藝是中國的張恨水流）。把文遠憧憬著的純文藝的夢，隨著他來完成的大作人生都一齊停頓了。不僅他，連當年攻擊前田河廣一郎的藝術政治性而氣燄高萬丈的菊池寛氏，都徘徊在大文衆藝的園上來了</p>
<p>關於前者的轉向派之轉向，不用說完全由於客觀環境的惡劣，使主觀條件也惡劣的緣因，而後者的轉向，卻由於那資本主義時代的必然之物質慾引誘。寫大衆文藝的稿費，如吉川英治，三上於莬吉等人都月收二三千左右，純文藝作家恐怕每月祇幾十左右，相去何遠，這物質的引誘必然地把沉面於都市生活的作家拉進谷里去。詩人西條八十曾經說，我寫一篇純藝術的詩最多給我三十元左右，如果爲留聲機舞臺作篇俚謠小曲，則在幾百以上。爲生活，不得不作俚曲。這種極大的物質引誘是多麼可怕呀。</p>
<p>總之轉向問題，頗在目今日文壇上佔相當紛爭，互認對方，而都不反省自已，無轉向後的重出發之深思，終究是種問題愈麻愈亂也。</p>
<p>目下的確是復與流行的季節，古典復興，文藝復興等的聲跡消失後，而主觀復興又繼之以起。</p>
<p>純文藝派中堅作家川端康成近來嘆息主觀的衰弱，新進作家矢彈崎議論主觀的提高，林房雄也高唱強調主觀，主觀復興一的季節，的確又降到日文壇來了。</p>
<p>在客觀重壓之下，人間生命之火似將絕息的時節，來提介此種論調，當然不能說作無理，在不能打破客觀的重壓之下，這是必然的自然之呌聲，不過成爲問題的是這主觀的如何取理，例如武者小路實寫生主觀性，的確令人閉口無言，然而究以何種強調與取理，來對付主觀呢？攻破武者小路實篤主觀的東西，是實證主義，亦即其客觀性與科學性，這的確是文學的一個騰利，現在我們所提倡的主觀，非築在勝利的土臺上不可，如此，才有了主觀的進步性。如果不如此，就能產生出武者小路實篤的幽靈了。這點的確是目前日本的提倡主觀復興時，所必須注意的事情。</p>
<p>最近成爲文壇的問題作的，是室生犀星氏的一神乎女乎。（文藝十月號，這篇東四是描寫一個摧有四個妾的男人，很如意地操縱四個女人的故事，在實際上說來這篇東西，並無極大的佳點，祇是能描寫各個不同的心理狀態，與男主人公蒲原的心理分析的成功，不過這篇的缺點頗多，第一。把主人公寫成值有錢的人，以錢來收買女人的心身之能如意，當然是不用聲言，而對方的四人，又無悍馬般強情。再者，那男主人之需要許多女人，當然應該是爲了適合自已，憧憬美的高尚的，和征服異性才對，但實際卻被寫咸爲這男之好色，在疾呆與善良之中，有無意力的頹廢的存在了。不過雖有以上缺點，但在目前純藝術派作品不振的時候，的確簡動日本十月的全批評家的注目，因爲有那銳利的心理分析。</p>
<p>最後，談件有興味的事件吧，最近某雜誌社向各作家詢問第二志願，即如果不做文學作家願作何人，回答的答案最有趣味的是尾崎士郎他說：　如果容我無理亂想，則或許做小偷，扒乎。其他如武田麟太郎的布爾喬亞或帝國軍人，芹澤光治良的司法官，近於秋江，武林夢想庵，張嚇宙等的政治家，英堆；新屆格的畫家等，都答的非常有趣。</p>
<h3 id="c282">北地之秋 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 林煕</p>
<p>北地之秋像悽悒的胡琴。</p>
<p>胡琴實在不是令人心愛的東西，你可曾在個什麼音樂會里看到胡琴獨奏嗎？大至鋼琴，小如口琴，都可使黑壓壓的觀衆隨著音調的起落而呼吸；而胡琴的那個近於吵鬧的音調，卻從未爲一般人所愛好過。但試想吧，假使你是在荒漠的塞外，你的心隨著大地的空漠而空漢起來，你想哭，但不知什麼使你哭；遠望是沙連著沙，風吹著沙，沙也送著風；太空漠，也太寂寞，大地上少一件東西，你的心里也少一件東西；這東西像靈堂前的香，像棺材上的紅罩子，可以吸出你心底的涙來。我說，這東西就是悽悒的胡琴了。那像一支鋼針，是的，是鋼針，刺著天，刺著地，也刺著你空漢的心。那聲音是活的，波盪的，是悽抑而又哀怨的。那聲音像哭，但不是純悲哀的哭，那像是一個蓋世的英雄，在坎坷猶證的時候，即是無可奈何了而又想從無可奈何中找出出路來的哭訴。這味道，冰天雪地里的蘇武大概是嘗過的，但蘇武還有他的羊羣聊資慰藉，設若是一個邊塞的將軍，被困於番邦之外，在那個境界中，真無怪他要流出涙來。北地之秋，是會使人感到這樣的。</p>
<p>北地之秋又像一首邊塞詩。</p>
<p>邊塞詩是富於異國情調的，這異國情調含著悲哀的成分，但不是海上生明月，天涯共此時的悲哀；道悲哀是雄渾的，是屬於大風起分雲飛揚，安得猛士兮守四方的，是氣拔山，力蓋世而嘆奈若何的，是易水之濱，秋風薔瑟。壯士一人，揮乎而渡的。大漢風塵日色昏，紅旗半捲出轅門一，像這種字眼，給你的印象不是漢漠然的嗎？在邊塞的荒漢里，風捲著衣塵，一層層在昏黃的日色里擴展開來，望過去是那麼半透明的，有如千軍萬馬的背後，揚起一陣塵埃，從塵埃里隱約地可以看出軍馬的背影來：而昏昏的日色，照著渾濁的塵霧，使境界更顯得昏昏而沉沉：在昏沉之中，更遠望是空漠的原野，這便帶著些空虛的味兒了。填著這空虛的，又恰好是空虛的風，塵，和昏昏的日色，這真是無可奈何的空盧：這是可以使人悵望著原野而非常想使勁地呼出一口氣來的。北地之秋，會給人這樣的情調。</p>
<p>在南方，難也有秋，但那是纏綿的，像月夜，像一首調：會使人想到童時的衣箱，衣箱里放著童時媽媽做的衣裳；比較起來，同是秋，而牠們的距離正像地理上的南北一樣。當南方草黃的時候，北地的秋原，早已是風送送塵夾著昏昏的日色了。</p>
<h3 id="c283">寂寞的人 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 馮慕</p>
<p>寂寞的花，在寂寞的人的心里開放了。在一個非常寂寞的地方，我寂寞地憶著：</p>
<p>一個非常晴明的早晨，省立體育塲開始了往日罕有的熱鬧：每一排看臺的凳子，積滿著厚厚的灰塵，有著人自動地措拭了。那就是說人的擁擠，已沒使人顧著的機會。這是一個兩年前全省運動開幕後的第二天，朋友潘浚是這個運動會一千五百米項卜的選乎。他年齡那時還祇十四歲，但他是在本校上選而獲得了參與這個競賽的權利的。</p>
<p>自然以他的年齡和體力，結果是落選了，但他是達到終點而跑在第五而不取。最後他是在第二天的報上有了異樣地記載：被譽爲三十六英雄中的白袍小將。</p>
<p>如是這個地方哪！我顯明地親切地記著。</p>
<p>二年後，我今天重跑到這地方來，而這地方的情形也和現在並沒有兩樣：那麼擁擠的人，那麼擁擠的地方，那麼擁擠的情形，那麼擁擠的……但我的朋友，是在今年夏天患著肺炎不治而死那。</p>
<p>那樣的地喊著，我悲哀著。我懷念到我的朋友一頁光榮的片斷，我的涙是不禁掉下來了</p>
<p>「正這個地方啊！正是這個地方啊！」</p>
<p>那樣地喊著，我這個寂寞的人，帶著一顆灰白色的心重跑了出來。</p>
<p>「悲哀的種子呀！」</p>
<p>這喊聲，是從眼涙里帶下來的。</p>
<h3 id="c284">鐘聲 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>

<p>— 爲何</p>
<p>你寫那一付呀！</p>
<p>但我不答應他，只給他惡狠狠的一眼，又很快很潦草的寫了下去。每寫一個字，他就在書上亂找，有時以爲他眼花看不見。於是用指頭指著找，又呌那些紳士看，但都說跟書上不同。而且他又看到我突然寫得那樣快那樣潦草，似乎是有意糟踢紙張，呌他倒賠的樣子，真敎他吃驚憒怒得臉色蒼白。</p>
<p>你究竟打算寫些什麼？</p>
<p>看到我寫完了朱門酒肉臭，接著想寫路有陳死人的時候，他不覺勃然大怒了。</p>
<p>誰告訴你的，誰告訴你這樣寫的，畜生！他拍著桌子罵：這算對子嗎？</p>
<p>他拉著我的耳朶，在桌上撞我的頭，把我的鼻子打破了，血流滿了金光燦爛的萬年紅，一塊塊的滲了開去。</p>
<p>父親原是襄弱的，但那次打起我來，他卻似乎非常有氣力，每著都非常得勁，使我就是想遮掩也無從遮掩。母親來勸也無用，彷佛我犯下了一塲滔天大罪，看他樣子真殘暴得對待我像對待畜生一樣。</p>
<p>你想刮我面皮是不是？你想坍我臺是不是？你這畜生，我鞭死你，鞭死你……</p>
<p>我像在旋風里打轉，四方面都感到疼痛。眼珠子似乎炸出我的眼眶了，一時昏黑，一時卻又看見無救火星在撩亂著。頭嗡嗡的響，神志糊塗得分不清人的面孔。</p>
<p>有什麼錯呢，爸爸？</p>
<p>我配得自已在痛苦的掙扎中，只是重覆著這句話。原來的憤怒羞愧，那時已經結成塊，像疲似的，又濃又重的壓住心頭。</p>
<p>父親不顧一切的，只是咬緊牙齒打，有時喝一聲畜生不準你多說。束乎無策的母親，也在旁邊啼哭著。至於那些大人先生呢，有的一聲也不響，站在一旁作壁上觀；有的假惺惺的說幾句風涼話，客氣客氣；有的靜悄悄的溜走了；更有的卻特別爽快地幫著老頭子罵我：</p>
<p>打得有道理，小孩子這樣不聽話，照自已一相情願，哼，以後還了得！（完）</p>

I urge you to come to the temple or my residence as soon as possible to discuss everything. Before Xiao left, he told reporters that Mongolian affairs are quite difficult to deal with due to environmental factors. This time, I am ordered by Chiang to represent the central government in entering Mongolia, meeting with Yun Wang and De Wang, conveying the central government's intentions, and inspecting everything. Mongolia is located on the border, and we should unite and protect the country. I will stay in Mongolia for about two weeks and then return to Beiping to report to Chiang. (31st Special Telegram)</p>

However, because the houses outside the pass have not been completed, a unit of about forty puppet police officers is temporarily housed at the puppet police headquarters in front of the South Gate of Gubeikou. The Japanese are building houses on the east bank of the Chao River at Erdaoqiao, two miles north of the Great Wall. The thirty to forty puppet police officers at the South Gate began to withdraw outside the pass on October 16. The puppet police captain, Hong Luhe, has officially returned the town to our Gubeikou Office. Four puppet police officers are stationed at the North Gate, responsible for checking departing passengers. The puppet police south of the Great Wall have now completely withdrawn outside the pass.

<h3 id="e16">Disaster Relief and the Rural Relationship <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Shu.</p>
<p>China has a vast territory and a complex climate, ranging from the subtropical to the frigid zone. The population is very large, and agriculture is the main industry. Therefore, the relationship with the weather is extremely important. Since the prevalence of floods and droughts cannot be avoided, we can only rely on human efforts to defend against them. At best, floods and droughts do not become disasters. At the very least, the damage caused by natural disasters must be reduced. This is what is meant by "man will conquer nature," using human power to overcome nature. This year, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Hunan, have been widely affected by drought. Some have no harvest, some have five or six tenths of a harvest, and some have one or two tenths of a harvest. What is the total harvest? Although there is a lack of accurate statistics, it is estimated that the rice harvest may not reach seven-tenths of the normal year. The rural food supply has become a problem. In large cities, adjustments can be made by borrowing rice and wheat from elsewhere. But what about small and medium-sized cities? It is now the time when new grain is being sold, and famine cannot be avoided. As autumn turns to winter, the weather will gradually get colder. What will happen to the general countryside? This is what the Chinese people are concerned about.</p>
<p>The Chinese countryside has experienced years of continuous natural disasters and man-made disasters. The economic exhaustion has reached its peak. Even if the weather is favorable and the harvest is abundant, it is only temporary security. How much more so in the face of this rare drought? What is even worse is that rural side businesses, such as silk and tea in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and tung oil in Sichuan, were sufficient to benefit the general farmers, allowing ordinary society to be slightly active and the national economy to have a considerable supplement. However, today, the world economy is in decline, and the export of raw materials and semi-manufactured products is also nearing its end. This has a very significant impact on the Chinese countryside. Moreover, the increasing development of various substitute goods and the extraordinary progress of countries seeking self-sufficiency in raw materials are also advancing rapidly. Rural side businesses will inevitably fall into a more difficult situation. Therefore, if there is no thorough, effective, and self-help policy today, the danger of the future is truly unimaginable. The reason why Chinese cities are still seen as developing is either due to political relations or the exchange of goods in commerce. Those with a real industrial base are actually few. Therefore, the Chinese economy lacks internal elasticity and has less room for maneuvering externally. As for the consumption side, only a few have sufficient strength in the big cities. After the rural economy fails to circulate, the commercial activities specializing in transportation are naturally difficult. The industry that has just developed is even more affected. In advanced industrial countries, if agricultural development loses balance during this extraordinary period, the entire national economy will inevitably suffer. Industrial products in the domestic market will shrink, and overseas markets will be stifled. Then overproduction can immediately become a disaster. Moreover, China is poor and weak, and the countryside is still in the handicraft era. Even the industrial organization in big cities is still in the initial stages of development. And the rural areas are so dilapidated. How can they withstand this impact?</p>
<p>For the current self-help plan, the palliative solution is to take advantage of this period to make good use of the excess mechanical power of advanced countries, supplemented by low-cost labor, to engage in industrial construction and manufacture low-priced products. At the same time, carefully study rural consumption power, and strive to make domestic products suitable for rural needs. The price must also be within the economic power of the countryside. Then the domestic market may be gradually developed. However, the market price of agricultural products is particularly low in the place of origin. Comprehensive calculations show that it can hardly cover the original production costs. Farmers' lives are so difficult. Consumption of industrial products is naturally equal to zero. The way to transform this lies in raising the market price of agricultural products and giving farmers various economic benefits. This is the indirect way to increase rural consumption. To restore this declining market, it is necessary to make every effort to study and find a starting method.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Soviet Russia Publishes Details of Negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Responsibility for Delays Lies with Japan</p>
<p>Price Agreed, Many Details Remaining</p>
<p>Moscow: Recently, the Japanese press has been reporting inaccurately on the progress of the negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Simultaneously, various Manchurian newspapers have been making groundless accusations against the Soviet Union, engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda. TASS has obtained the following information from reliable sources regarding the true situation of the negotiations:</p>
<p>Since TASS issued reports on the progress of the negotiations on August 18th and August 28th, the representative of the Japanese Foreign Ministry has been forcefully advocating for the reopening of the negotiations, which broke down at the beginning of August, based on the demands of the Japanese-Manchurian side (i.e., that all their proposed suggestions must be accepted). On September 6th, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota stated to Soviet Ambassador Yurenev that he was willing to increase the price of ¥120 million proposed by the Japanese-Manchurian side on July 23rd to ¥130 million. On September 12th, Yurenev replied to Hirota, stating that, according to the Soviet government's view, these negotiations had already lasted fifteen months. Now was not the time for further haggling over minor details and dragging things out, but rather to seek a proper conclusion to the negotiations. The price of ¥160 million proposed by the Soviet government on July 30th already represented a great sacrifice, as this figure was far below the railway's actual cost. However, if settling the price could bring the negotiations to a close, and if the Japanese government could agree immediately, then the Soviet government would consider reducing the price further to ¥145 million. At that time, Hirota offered ¥140 million again.</p>
<p>On September 19th, Yurenev informed Hirota that the Soviet government did not wish to see the negotiations prolonged any further and was willing to sell at a price of ¥140 million, excluding the compensation for employees laid off by the Chinese Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>With both sides having agreed on the price, negotiations proceeded on other terms of the sale, the most notable of which were the conditions for the transfer of the railway and the guarantee of funds. Regarding the first issue, the Japanese-Manchurian side suggested that once the sale agreement was signed, all rights to the railway would be transferred to Manchuria. However, the Japanese-Manchurian side also insisted that the transfer of the railway should be executed within one month of the signing of the agreement. To expedite the signing of the agreement, the Soviet side accepted Hirota's suggestion that ownership be transferred to Japan immediately after the agreement was signed, but could not agree to the conditions of the proposed transfer. This would mean that Manchuria would be the owner of the railway, while the Soviet Union would be responsible for the railway's operations and economic status during the transfer period. Given the current mentality of the Japanese-Manchurian authorities, such an arrangement would lead to all sorts of serious conflicts and would be detrimental to the friendly relations between the two countries. Moreover, this selling price is not its true value but just an agreed number by both sides. The Japanese-Manchurian side proposed the railway's transfer and handover should follow the asset directory, detailed specifications, and all accounts. The railway's liabilities should also be explained, with the new owner responsible for repayment. This further demonstrates the unfounded nature of the Japanese-Manchurian demands.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, when the sale agreement is signed, it is only necessary to attach an appendix regarding all debts incurred after the first statement of the railway has been submitted.</p>
<p>The next difficulty concerned the portion of the price owed by Manchuria that would not be paid immediately, and the issue of Japan guaranteeing that Manchuria would fulfill its obligation to pay the railway price in cash and goods. Hirota opposed the Soviet Union's demand and insisted that the Soviet Union should trust Manchuria without any guarantee. However, given that the Soviet Union was transferring such a large transportation organization to Manchuria after the agreement was signed, it is easy to understand its desire to ensure that Manchuria would fulfill its obligations on schedule (with the outstanding amount being repaid in three years).</p>
<p>In addition, an important dispute concerned a portion of the assets located in Manchuria that did not belong to the Chinese Eastern Railway but were only seized during the intervention movement and the Soviet Civil War. The return of these assets to the Soviet Union has also become an issue.</p>
<p>The two sides have reached an understanding on a number of other issues. For example, it has been decided that two-thirds of the railway price will be paid in goods and one-third in cash, and that payment can be made abroad. In addition, half of the cash payment must be made immediately after the agreement is signed. Furthermore, the two sides have agreed in principle that if the exchange rate of the yen falls below a certain limit, the currency payment should be converted according to the gold exchange rate at that time. Regarding the dismissal of Soviet employees, both sides agreed that the new Manchurian administration must give three months' notice before dismissing them, and allow them to remain in Manchuria for two months to settle their private affairs. Dismissed employees may settle all their accounts with the railway according to the current railway regulations, and their families and belongings may be transported free of charge to the Soviet border.</p>
<p>From the above, it is clear that much of the propaganda in the Japanese and Manchurian newspapers is unfounded. During these negotiations, which have lasted nearly a year and a half, the Soviet Union has strived for the sake of Japanese-Soviet relations and general peace, and has worked hard to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. This is undeniable. Although the Soviet Union's efforts have been met with many obstacles from the other side, this is not the Soviet Union's fault. Sources also say that another reason for the prolongation of these negotiations is that the Japanese-Manchurian side has often withdrawn its original proposals.</p>
<p>The main remaining difference is the issue of guaranteeing payment. If the Japanese-Manchurian side can act in good faith, then all major issues can be resolved satisfactorily in the near future. (TASS dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, visited Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday and presented the Moscow government's response to the draft transfer conditions proposed by the Foreign Minister on the 22nd. Discussions continued until 7:00 PM without reaching a conclusion. It was decided to continue negotiations at 10:00 AM today. However, the Soviet Union's response seems to reiterate its previous position, and it may take some time before both sides can reach a consensus. The contents of the counterproposal presented by the Soviet Union are as follows: 1. Government-guaranteed Manchurian public bonds should be handed over to the Soviet Union at the time of signing. 2. Payment in materials should be completed within two years. The prices of materials will be determined by a committee of three countries: Japan, the Soviet Union, and Manchuria. 3. Although the inventory of assets should be submitted again, the valuation of various assets should be discussed in advance. Public construction that should remain on the Soviet side should still follow the previous claims. 4. Severance pay for Soviet employees is a separate matter from severance pay for Chinese Eastern Railway employees. 5. The handover period is one month after signing. (Dentsu dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>Japan Proposes a Gradual Approach to Equality</p>
<p>Britain and the US Insist on the Current Ratio System</p>
<p>Roosevelt Suddenly Has Lengthy Talk with Stimson</p>
<p>London: The naval talks between the UK, the US, and Japan have reached a critical stage. It is hoped that today's meeting between the US and Japanese representatives may break the deadlock and provide a turning point toward a compromise. The US and Japanese representatives are now well aware of each other's views and are planning to communicate in order to find a basis for future discussions. Japan's position is currently very difficult to grasp. Although Japan does not want to equalize its navy with other countries immediately, it hopes to achieve this within a few years if the UK and the US allow it to have equal naval rights. However, both the UK and the US have expressed their firm determination to maintain the 5:5:3 ratio. Therefore, they will likely oppose the gradual approach to equality because it is equivalent to breaking the ratio. The current situation can be described as a moment of grave crisis. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt met with former Secretary of State Stimson of the Hoover administration for a long time today. According to Stimson, the discussion was about ordinary diplomatic matters. However, at a time when the London naval talks are underway, special attention should be paid to the inside story of US-Japanese relations. H.H. Bell, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, and other officials from the State Department's financial department were also summoned after the President met with Stimson. They had recently been involved in commercial and tax negotiations. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>

<p>Can Stipulate Completion in Several Years</p>
<p>But Unwilling to Accept Equality on Paper</p>
<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, told the press today that Japan does not seek naval equality with the UK and the US, but only wishes to achieve this goal within a few years. Ambassador Saito recently returned to Japan to consult with leaders of the Foreign Ministry and the Navy. His remarks after returning to his post are likely to ease the tense atmosphere caused by Japan's demands at the London naval talks. According to reports from London, Japan is demanding immediate equality. Although Ambassador Saito has made this explanation, he also stated firmly that the equality that Japan is referring to is the equality of warship tonnage, not empty talk of equality in name only. Some have interpreted this statement as a response to the US proposal published in the newspapers, namely that the strength of warships should be based on the relative security of each country. According to this proposal, Japan, due to its isolated geographic position, has a 35% special security advantage. Therefore, if it has 65% of the naval strength, it is already equal to the UK and the US. Ambassador Saito said that Japan will only be satisfied if the number of warships and gun positions is equal. If other countries are willing to reduce their numbers, Japan is also willing to reduce its numbers, as long as it can achieve equality in the end. Saito denied that the Japanese government is currently planning to sign a non-aggression treaty with the United States. As for yesterday's news that the US Navy has completed plans to build defenses at its Pacific naval and air bases in response to Japan's demand to abolish the naval treaty, Saito did not comment.

<p>Explains Offensive and Defensive Armaments</p>
<p>London: The US and Japanese delegations were originally scheduled to meet today, but due to conflicting opinions between the two sides, the meeting was canceled and postponed to another day. US Representative Davis is resting due to fatigue. The Japanese delegation will host the US delegation at the Japanese Embassy on the 31st to explain Japan's interpretation of offensive and defensive weapons. (Japan United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: The Japanese delegation has held two meetings each with the UK and the US to explain Japan's disarmament policy, but has not gained the recognition of the two countries. As a result, the conflict between Japan and the UK and the US will become more profound. Ambassador Matsudaira has therefore decided to conduct negotiations in the form of private talks. He visited British Foreign Secretary Simon on the afternoon of the 30th to exchange views. Matsudaira also met with US Representative Davis on the afternoon of the 31st at 4:30 to exchange views. (Japan United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira visited the British Parliament on the afternoon of the 30th and met with Foreign Secretary Simon in the Foreign Secretary's office for secret talks. (Japan United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: US and Japanese naval representatives are scheduled to hold important talks at 4:30 PM today to make progress on the naval issue. According to those around US Chief Representative Davis, the US representatives plan to further explore the details of the Japanese proposal and begin discussing the figures requested by Japan during today's exchange of views. On the Japanese side, however, it seems determined to first obtain agreement on the major principles put forward by Japan before further discussing the figures. Therefore, the views of both sides are still in conflict. However, this afternoon, a way may be found to mask the fundamental conflict between the two sides, or at least to find a way to keep the negotiations going. When British Foreign Secretary Simon met with Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira last night, he expressed the British Cabinet's desire to do so. As for the US, it has consistently exercised caution to avoid a breakdown in negotiations, as the US Congress will soon hold local elections, and if the negotiations break down, domestic public opinion in the US will be very unfavorable to the government. However, so far, the fundamental attitudes of all parties toward this issue remain irreconcilable. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>Bombs Thrown into Japanese Farmers' Homes</p>
<p>Governor Orders Foreign Farmers to Leave</p>
<p>Phoenix, USA: The Governor's Office here received a report today that there were renewed anti-Japanese demonstrations in the Salt River Valley. It is said that unknown persons threw bombs into two Japanese farmers' homes near Glendale this morning. One home suffered heavy losses, so the relationship between the Japanese and local farmers there has become tense again. Two other Japanese farms elsewhere were also attacked with bombs. One exploded, shattering the windows and injuring a Japanese child. It is heard that Arizona Governor Moe is prepared to take measures to prevent such incidents from happening again, but there have been previous bombings and no prevention has been seen. The root cause of the mutual hatred is that the economic levels of Japanese and American farmers are different. American farmers believe that they cannot cope with the competition from the Japanese, so incidents have occurred repeatedly. The governments of both Japan and the US have also had informal discussions, but Japan has repeatedly stated that it believes that local officials can handle the matter properly, so it has not formally protested so far. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>
<p>Phoenix, USA: It has been learned that a few hours after three bombs were thrown into the farms operated by Japanese residents the other day, the Arizona State Attorney ordered 30 foreign farming households in the Salt River Valley to leave the land they occupied or cultivated.

<p>London: The government of Manchukuo issued a formal statement yesterday promising equal treatment for importers, exporters, and distributors of kerosene, regardless of nationality, under the new kerosene monopoly law. London is not satisfied with this, saying that the kerosene monopoly has become an iron law and will not be lessened by this statement. It is expected that the kerosene monopoly is only a precedent for other industries. If this move is successful, the next victim will be the tobacco industry. It is believed that Japan deliberately announced the kerosene monopoly after welcoming the British industrial survey mission to show other countries that if they do not recognize Manchukuo, they will not gain anything there.

<p>Relocation of Armories to Prevent Aerial Bombardment</p>
<p>Many Oppose the Incitement to Disaffection Act</p>
<p>London: Parliament reconvened today to discuss a wide range of issues, including war debts, unemployment, and shipping. Responding to a question about the issue of wearing party uniforms, Home Secretary Gilmour said that the matter was still under consideration by the Home Office, but he could not state whether the government would submit legislation on the matter to the next Parliament. He could continue to discuss the matter with the leaders of the opposition parties. Financial Secretary to the War Office, Hacking, denied the rumor that the government intended to move the Woolwich Arsenal to another location to prevent aerial attacks, and said that the entire issue was under consideration, but he could not make any comments on the matter at this time. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated that negotiations were not currently underway regarding the British debt to the US, and that he could not make any statement regarding the installment due on December 15th. In short, there was no new development to report. Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the government's special committee to investigate the disaster situation in the unemployed areas had issued a report, and the investigators had agreed on several proposals. In view of the importance of the matter, the government intended to designate a day to discuss the published report in October. The House of Commons asked the government to allow a debate on the private arms trade. The Prime Minister immediately agreed. President of the Board of Trade Runciman stated that on September 28th, shipping companies had submitted a plan to the government to subsidize merchant ships without fixed routes in order to alleviate the difficulties of the shipping industry. Legislation would be necessary to implement this plan. The government had contacted overseas autonomous regions and India and several foreign governments on this matter. It is now heard that the Chamber of Shipping is trying to convene an international shipping conference to develop ways to adjust the supply of tonnage according to demand. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>London: The government's rigorous Incitement to Disaffection Act is strongly opposed, as can be seen during today's review in the House of Commons. Liberal Party member Marlaud moved to add a new clause stipulating that when the police search a house, they must summon two or more respectable neighbors to supervise the search. The member also said that the Indian Penal Code of 1898 contained a similar clause. The Labour Party in the House of Commons supported the motion, but the Royal Law Advisor General Inskip and the Prosecutor General opposed it, considering it impractical and unnecessary. Inskip said that the clause contained in the Indian Penal Code of 1898 does not force people to be witnesses to police searches of houses, and the situation in India is very different from that in the UK.

<p>Hitler Negotiates with the Opposition</p>
<p>Expresses Displeasure at Church Split</p>
<p>Berlin: Thirty representatives of the Bavarian National Socialist Party farmers, who claimed to represent 200,000 Bavarian Christians, reportedly met with German Head of State Hitler today to discuss the German Church crisis. However, an official of the Chancellery denied that Hitler had received these people. It is said that one of Hitler's subordinates met with the delegation, listened to their explanations, and then asked them to go to the Ministry of the Interior. This morning, the farmers lined up to go to the Chancellery. A Black Guard soldier on duty wanted to order them to leave, so the farmers told him in Bavarian, "Mind your own business. They will tell the head of state the truth about the church." Later, the leader of the delegation claimed that after seeing the head of state, they told him that Dr. Müller and Prussian Interior Minister Dr. Goebbels were destroying the Lutheran Church and must be removed from office. This afternoon, Hitler met with Bavarian Bishop Meiser and others, the three leaders who opposed the German National Church, for about two hours, but the results of the talks were not revealed. It is heard that the three bishops are currently discussing the current situation. Their report will be the basis for the upcoming discussions by representatives of the opposition church members on future attitudes. A senior government official told a Reuters interviewer today that Hitler did not want to personally interfere in the church dispute and would hand the matter over to the Ministry of the Interior for proper handling. According to political sources, Hitler is willing to have all factions of the church hold a round table conference to discuss peaceful cooperation. Prussian Interior Minister Dr. Goebbels has resigned from his church position due to pressure from the National Socialist Party. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German news agency recently released a message saying that Head of State Hitler received three bishops of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Hanover yesterday. These three are all famous for opposing the national church, and among them, bishops Bavier and Wittenberg have also been dismissed by the church legal management committee Jagel and are no longer bishops. Now Hitler has received them all, and this message is released by the official news agency, which is particularly noteworthy. According to a general investigation, Hitler is very displeased with the internal divisions of the Evangelical Church. When he received the three bishops yesterday, he seemed to have expressed his decision not to support the national church again. Therefore, after this message came out, those who relied on Hitler's protection were very uneasy, while those who were not from the national church felt that Hitler's change of attitude was very fortunate for the future of the German Jesus Church.

<p>Berlin – According to today's news, the People's Court recently sentenced several people accused of being foreign spies to severe punishments. Several were sentenced to death, and many were sentenced to several years of imprisonment and hard labor. Only two were sentenced to ordinary imprisonment. According to official sources, these punishments were imposed in accordance with the old laws, because the crimes were committed before the promulgation of the new laws. According to the new law, any German who betrays the country will lose his life. Because the National Socialist Party places the welfare of the entire nation first, it does not hesitate to impose the death penalty on traitors and spies. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>The King drives for two hours</p>
<p>Rumors of assassination are unreliable</p>
<p>Sofia – Bulgarian King Boris was traveling by express train from Sofia to Varna today when the engine caught fire 140 miles from his destination. The driver was burned by the fire. The King then took care of the injured driver and drove the train himself at full speed to a riverside, where he helped extinguish the fire. He then jumped back into the driver's cab and drove the train safely to Varna, driving for two hours in total. It is said that King Boris liked to drive various machines during the European War, and he often joked that if he lost his throne, he could become a driver to support himself. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia – Foreign newspapers reported that the fire in the engine of the special train of Bulgarian King Boris was caused by a bomb hidden in the coal in the engine. This is hardly credible here. However, it is known that there was no danger in the incident. Because the King's carriage was attached to a passenger train bound for Varna, the engine suddenly caught fire when passing through the Strazhitsa station. The train stopped, and the King immediately rushed to the engine, where he saw that the driver's clothes were on fire. The King pulled down the driver's clothes and moved him to rest on the couch in the King's sleeping car. Although the driver was burned by the fire, his life was not in danger. The King then acted as the driver and drove straight to Varna. As for the rumors of assassinating the King, they are all false. (30th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Bronze Statue of Huang in Wuchang Unveiled</p>

Ye Chucang chaired the meeting and conducted the ritual. Later, Wang Zhaoming reported on the revolutionary deeds of Martyr Huang, stating briefly: "The revolutionary achievements of Mr. Huang Xing cannot be fully described in a short time. Only the three most prominent points will be briefly mentioned: 1. When the Boshin War of Independence broke out, the revolutionary organization was scattered. The Premier founded the Tongmenghui, and Mr. Huang Xing was the first to assist the Premier and worked the hardest, finally unifying the will of the revolutionaries and uniting them under the organization of our Party, which then developed day by day. 2. The Huanghuagang Uprising was launched despite the fact that our Party comrades knew it would fail, in order to awaken revolutionary sentiment with blood and flesh and to seek credibility at home and abroad. At that time, Mr. Huang Xing was the one who commanded the comrades in Guangzhou and directed everything, resulting in the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs. Huang Xing was also wounded and bled. His loyalty and bravery will be remembered forever by future generations. 3. The success of the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 was due to Mr. Huang Xing commanding a small number of revolutionary troops in Hankou and Hanyang, engaging in bloody battles with Qing soldiers, and holding out for a month. Subsequently, Mr. Chen Qimei responded in Shanghai, and Nanjing was recovered, making the revolutionary momentum in the Jiangnan area majestic and leading to success. From these three events, we know that Mr. Huang Xing's loyalty, bravery, and spirit of hard work and sacrifice not only laid the foundation for the revolution and for our Party, but also laid the foundation for the Republic of China. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Huang Xing and recall his life's achievements, we should strive to emulate his loyalty and bravery, and complete his unfinished great cause, in order to fulfill the responsibilities of those who come after him." After Wang finished his speech, the meeting adjourned. (31st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Cotton Yarn Consolidated Tax Issue <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Talks with a certain director of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Nanjing – Regarding the increase in the consolidated tax on cotton yarn and the refund of the increased import tax on foreign cotton, according to a certain director of the Ministry of Finance, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the consolidated tax, the tax rates on various goods have increased. At that time, the consolidated tax on domestic cotton yarn was not increased, because the government has been trying to ease the difficulties of merchants and reduce tax revenue. However, the cotton mills have not been relieved by the reduction in the consolidated tax. The reasons for their economic downturn can be divided into three points: 1. The machinery is too old. 2. The management is not scientific. For example, foreign cotton mills can manage more than 30 machines per person, while Chinese merchants can only manage a few machines. Foreign cotton mills have ample capital, while banks charge higher interest rates on loans to Chinese cotton mills. There are many other reasons, but only the major ones are mentioned here. For these reasons, the government believes that it has an unshirkable responsibility to rescue the cotton industry. However, it is certain that rescuing the cotton industry cannot be achieved by reducing the consolidated tax. We should earnestly work from the fundamental aspects. On the one hand, the government will increase the consolidated tax on cotton yarn to balance the tax rates. On the other hand, it should further plan fundamental relief. As for the issue of refunding the increased tax on foreign cotton, domestic cotton used to be American cotton. Now, domestic cotton, such as Shaanxi cotton, etc., uses American cotton seeds. After improvement, the yield and quality have improved. If domestic cotton can be sold as much as possible, the government should protect it. Therefore, the import tax on foreign cotton, which used to be 3.5 gold units per 100 kilograms, has been increased to 5 gold units, an increase of 1.5 yuan. Because the sales of Chinese cotton are becoming more and more widespread, the Ministry of Finance plans to grant a tax refund of 1.5 gold units for the export of foreign cotton in order to promote the sale of domestic cotton to foreign markets. This measure directly promotes the spread of domestic cotton in the international market and indirectly protects the stability of domestic cotton prices, which is beneficial to Chinese cotton production and diplomacy. In short, foreign merchants now feel that the increase in the consolidated tax on cotton yarn is a sovereign right of the Chinese government, so they respect this reasonable tax increase. Chinese merchants, based on one-sided feelings, have not considered the reasons behind this and hastily petitioned for exemption from the increase, which seems to be somewhat regrettable in terms of national consciousness.

<p>Measures for exchanging them have not yet been drafted</p>
<p>Nanjing – The Ministry of Finance's new Pagoda stamps, printed by the Beiping Printing Bureau, have been completed and distributed to post offices in various places, and will be available for purchase on the first day. There are five types: 1 cent, 2 cents, 1 jiao, 5 jiao, and 1 yuan. The 1-cent stamp is brown, the 2-cent stamp is green, the 1-jiao stamp is yellow, the 5-jiao stamp is purple, and the 1-yuan stamp is blue. According to the person in charge of the Taxation Department, old stamps will be completely abolished from the first day. The measures for exchanging old stamps for new stamps have not yet been drafted. The stamps are sold by post offices on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, one to avoid exclusive sales, and the other to enable merchants and people to affix stamps properly. From November 1st onwards, all documents and certificates signed must be affixed with new stamps, otherwise they will be treated as tax evasion. All stamp tax sub-bureaus in various places must be closed by the end of October. Except for retaining one stamp, alcohol and tobacco tax general bureau in each province, all others will be abolished. The investigation matters will be handled by the general bureau. The unemployed employees of the various sub-bureaus had previously asked the Ministry of Finance to distribute them to post offices in various places to be responsible for selling stamps, but this right belongs to the Ministry of Communications, and this Ministry is not in a position to make any claims. Whether there is a solution has not yet been decided. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>New York: New York rubber futures prices fell sharply this morning, losing sympathy with the London rubber market.

This is the reason for the weakness of the British and American rubber markets. The New York opening price fell 0.40 pounds, and there was little recovery in the morning.</p>

<p>— Kashgar Correspondence.</p>
<p>After the rebel party occupied Hotan, they flocked down, numbering about ten thousand, approaching Pishan. Wang, the company commander of the county's defense forces, immediately led a unit of more than a hundred men (a mixture of Xibe from Yili and Han Chinese) to block them. That night, they marched to Piyaman (the border between Moyu and Pishan) and encountered the rebel party. Because it was dark, they could not ascertain how many there were, so they opened fire indiscriminately. It is estimated that with each bullet fired, at least two or three people were killed (the rebel returnees had no guns, only big-headed clubs). In a short time, about five or six hundred were killed, but in the end, they could not be repelled due to their superior numbers. Near dawn, Company Commander Wang retreated to Pishan (three or four men were killed in action) and immediately sent a letter to Kashgar requesting reinforcements. At this time, it was just after Jin Shuren's death, and Kashgar was in chaos and could not spare any attention. It was not until the end of March (the uprisings in Hotan and Moyu occurred around February 16th) that reinforcements arrived. Ma Shaowu's intention was to appease rather than suppress, but after seeing that there was no other way, he ordered the reinforcements to depart. However, although the reinforcements arrived, they did not dare to attack because of the rebel party's strength. Before long, Yecheng (Yecheng is between Pishan and Shache) also broke out in riots among the people and bandits, and Zepu responded. Many Han Chinese in the two counties were brutally killed. At this time, the rear of the reinforcements was cut off. Knowing that they could not defend, they detoured and retreated to Shache via a small road, with a journey of nine days. They were repeatedly attacked by villagers along the way, resulting in thirteen incidents of opening fire. Although hundreds of rioters were killed, the reinforcements had exhausted their strength before they could retreat to Shache. After the reinforcements retreated to Shache, they joined forces with the county's defense forces and formed a merchant corps from several hundred Han Chinese merchants who had fled from various places in advance and the local Han Chinese, with military and civilians working together (totaling more than a thousand people) to defend the city and asked Kashgar for reinforcements. Although Kashgar sent some reinforcements, they all carried weapons and defected because they were newly recruited people of the cloth and silk classes. Yierqiang also suddenly changed (the city is connected to Shache). At this time, Shache was surrounded on all sides, and the isolated city had no reinforcements. It is estimated that they were besieged for (four or five) months and killed 3,000 rebels who were besieging the city. The rebels did not dare to approach the city within several miles. However, before the siege of Shache was lifted, the Battle of Bachu broke out again. The treacherous and deceitful rebel returnees' previous peace was not sincere. In reality, they wanted to use the truce as an opportunity to carry out their conspiracy to incite and lure troops in the Kashgar area. Turbaned Temir (who had been promoted to regimental commander) sent people to lure Island Siman, the commander of the Buyi battalion (30 years old, spoke Chinese, originally served as Chen's Buyi civilian affairs officer, imprisoned for breaking the law, this time Ma Shaowu specially released him from prison and appointed him as the commander of the Buyi battalion). Island actually led his troops to betray and turn against them, killing the Han Chinese and Hui military officers in the regiment and gathering the Buyi people under his command at the radio station (20 li away from the Hui city), completely destroying all the equipment of the radio station, leaving only three radio poles. At the same time, the Buyi people in the mountains and rioters in various places also rose up in support, gathering five or six thousand people in a few days (fortunately, most of them had no weapons), disturbing the countryside, searching and robbing guns and horses, and also looting property. However, they would wash empty the houses of our Han Chinese. If there were heavy items that could not be carried, they would destroy them, not allowing even a single blade of grass or tree to remain in the house. Fortunately, people had fled into the city, otherwise they would have all been brutally murdered. At that time, the rioters in Jiashi (a county between Kashgar and Bachu) also gathered to riot. Kashgar was alarmed several times a day, and people were panicking. Although the authorities strongly maintained a calm attitude, the society had reached a state of chaos, and the situation in Bachu was particularly urgent. On a certain day in April, Liu Ding was lured and killed. After Kashgar received the report, they immediately ordered the army to retreat to Kashgar as soon as possible, hoping to fight to the death with the city as their backs. When the telegram arrived in Bachu, the area between Jiutai and Bachu had already been cut off by the rebel army. At that time, Yang Qingming was the acting county magistrate of Bachu. Seeing that the situation was critical, he took all the soldiers, more than a hundred men, and one or two hundred Han Chinese refugees from Bachu and retreated towards Kashgar (Bachu is six stations from Kashgar and four stations from Jiashi). When they retreated to Yingwatay (40 li away from Jiashi County), the rebel army had already tracked them down and opened fire dozens of times (according to reports, this time there were only about ten Hui people and ten guns, with the rest being two or three hundred local rioters, but all of them had no weapons). As a result, Yang Qingming was wounded in the leg, and a dozen soldiers were killed or wounded. The rioters forced the remaining ten or so people to surrender their weapons and transferred them to the Bachu Hui commander Ma Zhancang (32 years old, the leader of the plainclothes team, actually an ignorant desperado). After one unit of the Jiutai Kashgar army (about 500 men) learned that the rear route had been cut off, they retreated to Shache via a small road in Mogaidi County (one big station from Shache and four stations from Bachu). However, they were blocked and attacked by the turbaned people along the way. When they reached the edge of Heigaidi, they were caught up by the rebel army and surrendered all their weapons. They were transferred to Bachu. The main force of the rebel party was stationed in Bachu. Their vanguard, the fresh bandits, Ma bandits (Muslims), and Tie bandits (i.e., turbaned bandits Temir, all rebel regimental commanders), as well as the Buyi army (Muslim battalion commander), were all stationed in Jiashi, with a great momentum of advancing straight into Kashgar. At this time, Kashgar was in dire straits, and Ma Shaowu was helpless. However, because of his religious relationship with them, he still sent a letter to negotiate, requesting cooperation and asking for a peaceful resolution. Originally, the rebel party's goal was to rob and plunder. Moreover, Kashgar was a prosperous area in southern Xinjiang, and they had long coveted it. However, they also wanted to avoid a military conflict with the Kashgar army, so they pretended to accept Ma's (Shaowu) request and secretly ordered the Buyi people to attack Shufu (this was originally led by Temir). At dawn on May 2nd, the Buyi people suddenly attacked the city. Because the turbaned people were internal collaborators, the city was captured within a few hours. At this time, all the Han Chinese property and women and children inside and outside the city were looted by the Buyi turbaned people, and all Han Chinese who escaped or were found were killed. At this time, the lives of the Han Chinese were not even worth as much as a chicken. The most tragic thing was that many of the Han Chinese tombs were dug up. Fortunately, there were still a hundred or so Han Chinese who escaped into the Taoist office during the siege. Because the Taoist office had guards defending it, the rioters could not attack, so they were able to save their lives. However, they were all forced by the Buyi and turbaned people to convert to Islam and had to change into turbaned attire and pray five times a day (i.e., the turbaned people's Namaz). If they encountered troops of the Buyi or turbaned people, they had to recite a section of the Quran. If they could not recite it or could not recite it completely, they would be shot immediately. As a result, deaths were heard every day. Later, because they could not survive, they all fled into the Han city. At this time, the rioters in Jiashi and Bachu also arrived one after another. However, most of the Hui troops were stationed in the Han city, and only Ma Zhancang led some rioters stationed in the Hui city. Other rioters, such as the turbaned Temir, were also stationed in the Hui city. At this time, all the government offices and transportation agencies in the Hui city were occupied by the turbaned Hui people. The Han Chinese houses and temples were all destroyed, and they searched every house for Han Chinese possessions. If they encountered Han Chinese books, they would be destroyed. Commander Ma Zhancang was also under his threat at this time and had to follow his will in everything. Therefore, even the dignified religious leader Ma Shaowu did not hesitate to force him to step down. Later, Temir and Ma Zhancang divided the power, each nominally occupying a city. Ma Zhancang believed that the Han city was purely Han Chinese and could be united to defend against Temir's attacks. We Han Chinese knew that using a tiger for protection was tantamount to suicide, but under his power, there was nothing we could do. It is estimated that the party looted more than a million yuan from the Han Chinese in the Han city, and their inhumane acts of looting were worse than those of the Buyi and turbaned people. However, the great power ultimately fell aside because Ma Shiming, the leader of the Yanjing riots, and Ma Ren, the leader of the Aksu riots (leader of the plainclothes team), were all resolved by the turbaned bandits. At this time, the turbaned bandits were powerful and hated the Han Chinese and Hui people from Central China (wanting to organize a pure Turkic country). Although he claimed to be a commander, he was actually in a position of isolation and helplessness, and he had no way to go, which was the same as the Han Chinese. At this time, the turbaned Temir called himself a division commander and concurrently the commander-in-chief of border defense. First, he solved a group of Han Chinese in Shache (it is said that of the thousand or so Han Chinese, only a hundred or so remained, excluding the women who were looted), and then solved the two counties of Yingjisha and Puliy (three or four Han Chinese were left in Yingjisha, and only one was left in Puliy), and sealed off the exit route (foreigners could leave freely) and strictly prohibited Han Chinese from entering or leaving. We Han Chinese had long anticipated today's disaster and were willing to leave Kashgar as soon as possible. Before the rebel party reached Aksu, we repeatedly asked the Kashgar authorities to issue passports, but they were not approved (foreigners were an exception). It is not known what their intentions were. Now that the power of the turbaned bandits has grown, we only earnestly beg the central government to quickly send a large force of Han Chinese troops to Xinjiang to quell the rebellion. According to the investigation, the actual number of troops of the Buyi and turbaned parties in Kashgar is no more than 5,000 in total, and there is a severe shortage of guns and bullets (there are not enough 3,000 guns, and most of them are old-fashioned rifles). Recently, they have been in contact with the British Consulate in Kashgar, intending to purchase from Britain. The British Consulate refused because it did not have government permission. Moreover, their troops are all a mob, with no training. This time, taking advantage of the chaos, they have already plundered the wealth and women of the Han Chinese, and many do not want to be soldiers.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The military strength is decreasing rather than increasing, and the internal organization is also disorganized. If 100,000 regular troops are used (50,000 or 60,000 is also possible, but less is not enough for control), the rebellion in the entire Xinjiang province can be put down immediately. However, we must take decisive measures to cut the mess quickly. The sooner the better. If we continue to hesitate, the snipe and clam will fight, and the fisherman will benefit. I fear that Xinjiang will not be ours for long. (July 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Jiangsu Province Canal Dredging Project Officially Begins Today <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chen and Others Travel by Special Boat to Huai'an to Preside Over the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Province canal dredging project into the sea, originally scheduled to officially commence on October 10th, was repeatedly postponed due to lack of funding. It was not until the end of September that funding was secured. The project office actively prepared on October 1st. The original construction plan stipulated that workers from all counties should be recruited by October 15th, and construction sections should also be established by October 15th. Subsequently, due to the provincial government convening a meeting of county heads in the canal dredging area, the deadline was extended to the 20th. Further delays arose due to various difficulties, with the final decision to officially begin work today (the 1st). Provincial Government Chairman Chen Guofu, accompanied by Civil Affairs Director Yu Jingtang, Construction Director Shen Baixian, and others, crossed the Yangtze River on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 30th), traveling by special boat to Huai'an to preside over the opening ceremony and inspect the engineering design. A summary of Chief Engineer Ge's first-phase plan for dredging the canal into the sea and the implementation steps are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Calculation Aspects: The Yellow River's old course to be dredged this time connects the Zhangfu Diversion River from Hongze Lake in the north to the Taizikou outlet to the sea in the south, totaling more than 160 kilometers in length. From Yangzhuang to Qitao, the old embankments are mostly utilized, while below Qitao, an entirely new river channel is to be constructed. The original planned riverbed width was 120 meters, but the initial phase of construction has been revised to 35 meters, with side slopes of 1:2.5 and a top width of 230 meters (originally planned at 350 meters). The riverbed height is stipulated to be 7.5 meters below the flood level, while Taizikou is 6 meters below sea level. The gradient decreases by 7.05 centimeters per thousand meters. Using the Francis formula to calculate the flow rate, at a Hongze Lake water level of 13.5 meters, the discharge rate is 319 cubic meters per second; at 15 meters, it is 485 cubic meters per second; and at 15.5 meters, it is 550 cubic meters per second. According to current measurements, the abandoned Yellow River has no discharge when the water level is at 13 meters. Now that the Three Rivers active dam will be built, the normal water level of Hongze Lake will consistently be at 13.5 meters. Before major floods occur, the waterway to the sea can first be used for drainage, emptying Hongze Lake's water storage, thus reducing the impact of autumn floods. The excavation depth for the entire project ranges from a minimum of 6 meters to a maximum of 12 meters, with an average depth of over 8 meters. The earthwork is estimated at over 60 million cubic meters, with an average subsidy of eight cents of silver per cubic meter. Including the cost of materials, water removal equipment, and management, the total cost is estimated at seven million silver dollars, to be implemented over two years. In the first year, over 30 million cubic meters should be completed, requiring approximately half of the total budget.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Implementation Aspects: Surveying work, from mid-July to October 7th, was completed with the full support of the canal dredging committee's surveying team. Over 3,000 cross-sectional diagrams were drawn, and the new river channel was plotted on topographical maps. The area of the new cross-sections for river slopes was calculated separately, and finally, the amount of earthwork was tabulated and distributed to each section. The sections were then divided into two categories: Huaiyin with 20,000 workers over 22.762 kilometers; Siyang with 10,000 workers over 11.22 kilometers; Jiangdu with 5,000 workers over 4.192 kilometers; Taixian with 5,000 workers over 4.597 kilometers; Gaoyou with 10,000 workers over 10.234 kilometers; Baoying with 10,000 workers over 11.36 kilometers; Huaian with 20,000 workers over 22.42 kilometers; Lianshui with 25,000 workers over 22.625 kilometers; Xinghua with 10,000 workers over 10.287 kilometers; Dongtai with 5,000 workers over 3.289 kilometers; and Yancheng with 15,000 workers over 22.843 kilometers, totaling 160,000 workers over 162 kilometers. The bottom five kilometers of sea entrance beach cutting will be considered separately. In the third step of organizing the workers, each county will organize a general team, managed by the county government, with construction personnel as the general team leader. Districts will be divided into several brigades, each brigade with 1,000 people, led by a brigade commander, with platoon leaders below, each platoon with 100 people. Brigade commanders and platoon leaders will be appointed by the county magistrate from local self-governance personnel, under the command of the general team leader. Each platoon is divided into four squads, each squad with 25 people, with one foreman, who will use each squad or platoon to excavate an earth pond, measuring the work completed. As for maintaining order, in addition to the worker regulations, the county will dispatch a security team to protect everything at the construction site. Other matters concerning the workers' clothing, food, housing, and transportation are fully prepared. In the fourth step, regarding the water pumping project, on average, a small section of the new river channel will be excavated every eight kilometers, or a suitable location will be selected for dredging and installing pumping stations, requiring approximately twenty 12-horsepower water pumps. In addition, excavation methods will be used to allow the water to naturally drain away, with each worker equipped with water buckets to supplement the machine power. (31st)</p>

<p>Speaks to the Press</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: National Party Central Supervisory Committee member and Judge of the Hague International Court of Justice, Wang Chonghui, after arriving in Beiping, has met with Chairman Chiang twice. Wang also received the press at the Beijing Hotel at 5:30 PM today (30th), making the following important remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e88">Thoughts on Coming North <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>I have been away from Beiping for seven years. My impressions upon returning can be divided into two points: First, seven or eight years ago, the capital was in Beiping, so everything was more prosperous. Now that the capital has moved south, the city's condition is naturally depressed. However, there have been definite achievements in municipal construction. Second, the situation in Beiping as reported in the newspapers when I was abroad is very different from the impression I get from experiencing it firsthand. I am traveling back and forth between the north and south in a private capacity to convey messages to all parties. After arriving in Beiping, I have already met Chairman Chiang twice and plan to see him again tomorrow. After returning to Shanghai, I will pack my bags and prepare to return to The Hague at the end of the year to take up my duties.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Discusses Diplomacy <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Someone asked me about my predictions for the future trend of diplomacy in North China. In my opinion, diplomacy is a whole, and it is difficult to give a satisfactory answer in a very short time. As for the situation between Japan and Russia, in my view, both sides may be able to get along for the time being due to the railway sales issue. Regarding the pseudo-Manchukuo oil sales issue, this matter fundamentally violates the Washington Treaty's two major principles: 1. Equal opportunity; 2. Open door. Judging by common sense, it cannot become a reality. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Leaving Southward Soon <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Wang continued, saying that he would stay in Beiping for another day or two before going south to Shanghai. Whether he would make another trip to the southwest would depend on whether it was necessary. Assuming that he did not need to go to the southwest, he would definitely return to The Hague at the end of the year because he still had two months of vacation, and so on. (30th)</p>

<p>Zhengyang Bridge, outside Chaoyangmen on the road, is the main road in and out of the city. Originally made of wood, it has been dilapidated for ten years. Three months ago, the road company spent 13,000 yuan to rebuild it with copper-bone cement. It was contracted by the Shanghai Qiao Yu and Construction Factory. After construction started, the bridge was built day and night and has now been completed. At 10:00 AM on the 28th, a completion ceremony was held for the bridge. The road company hosted people from all walks of life at Yushan Elementary School to visit. The guests were very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Local rice, bean, and miscellaneous grain merchants, due to the Farmers Bank operating warehouses and engaging in transportation and sales, which conflicted with their business, were about to be taken over entirely. Therefore, they specifically proposed a discussion at the members' meeting of the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting a way to remedy the situation. The County Chamber of Commerce, on the previous day, invited leaders of the rice and grain industry and representatives of the Farmers Bank to discuss and mediate. As a result, the Farmers Bank agreed that agricultural warehouses would only accept and dispose of agricultural products directly entrusted by farmers themselves, or purchased by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. They would not accept products with the purpose of intermediate profit. The rice industry stated that if the Farmers Bank's involvement in transportation and sales benefited farmers and did not involve intermediate profit, they were willing to handle it on behalf of the bank within the possible range, following the pawnshop method. With this mutual agreement, the dispute was completely resolved.</p>

<p>Hua Juchu, Director of General Affairs of the Tobacco and Alcohol Public Monopoly Inspection Office, was previously accused by peddler Wang Jiugeng of smoking opium without a license. After the county's drug rehabilitation center conducted an initial examination, based on the report of Director Gu, he was found to have no drug addiction. Wang Zuogeng was dissatisfied and requested the County Anti-Opium Association to allow a joint re-examination. On the 22nd of last month, the association sent both parties to the county's drug rehabilitation center for a re-examination. As of the morning of the 30th, the period had expired. The results of the re-examination still showed no drug addiction. The Chief of General Affairs, Hua Hongshou, held a hearing and ordered Hua Juchu to submit the original guarantee, and Wang Zuogeng was detained. Wang again declared his dissatisfaction, saying that during the re-examination period, Hua Juchu was still eating supplements. One day, Hua was hungry and asked for something to eat at the center, without specifying what. Unexpectedly, the center gave him a bowl of candied lotus seeds to satisfy his hunger. This was very suspicious and requested that he be transferred to the provincial level for re-examination, or sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for re-examination, so that the truth could come out. Now, Wang Zuogeng has applied to be escorted to the provincial level for re-examination, and has also accused Gu Zengliang, the director of the County Drug Rehabilitation Center, of malpractice in the examination, requesting his dismissal and investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Large-Scale Opium Den Broken Up <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's Inspection Office received a secret report the night before yesterday that a large-scale opium dealer, Yang Chunxiang, was selling private opium at No. 13 Fenghuang Bridge Street, No. 24 Zhuyuan Lane, Zhou Shanbang, and No. 79 Baiyi Port outside the South Gate, managed by his mistresses Zhu Miao and Deng Miao, and his father Yang Qing, respectively. They requested their arrest. Chief Inspector Wang dispatched personnel to investigate in disguise and confirmed the report. At dawn yesterday, he personally led the police to search and arrest them. In No. 13 Fenghuang Bridge Street, they seized 107 taels of high-quality Yunnan opium, as well as wire baskets, chops, receipts for extortion, silver dollars, and other items, and arrested Zhu Miao. However, the main suspect, Yang Chunxiang, managed to escape. The police searched the 21 neighboring houses completely, but could not find him. They then went to No. 79 Baiyi Port and seized one catty of old Lantian opium, 44 taels of high-quality Yunnan opium, 3 catties and 10 taels of cake opium, as well as chops, scissors, silver dollars, and other items, and arrested Deng Miao. They then went to No. 24 Zhuyuan Lane, Zhou Shanbang, and seized opium scales, opium wrapping paper, silver dollars, and other items, and arrested Yang Qing. Later, they found that No. 23 next door was also Yang's opium trafficking contact point. They immediately entered and arrested Zhao Shilong, as well as banknotes, silver dollars, and other items, and took them all to the bureau to be handed over to the County Anti-Opium Association for legal action.</p>

<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce convened leaders from various industries on the afternoon of the 30th to discuss the issue of affixing the new stamp tax. Acting Chairman Xu Juxi presided over the discussion. The matters discussed included: 1. The new stamp tax is scheduled to be implemented on November 1st. The registration and exchange methods for the old stamp tax have not yet been announced. How should we express our opinion on this? It was resolved that stamp tax is a valuable security of the government. The chamber of commerce and merchants in this county affix stamp tax, which is related to actual affixing, and is different from those who recognize and sell them. The chamber of commerce and merchants should not suffer losses. Before the registration and exchange methods for the old stamp tax are announced, the implementation of the new stamp tax will be temporarily suspended. The chamber of commerce will telegraph the Ministry of Finance to inquire and announce the registration and exchange methods, and request the county government to temporarily suspend inspection to maintain public trust and alleviate merchants' difficulties. 2. The newly established stamp tax law adopts a progressive system, which merchants cannot afford. How should we express our opinion on this? It was resolved to telegraph the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original plan.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Drought Relief Association Seeks Donations from Other Ports <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The County Drought Relief Association, due to the severe drought situation in the county, has decided that the total relief funds needed are 250,000, which will be raised from other ports and from within the county. The raising of funds from other ports is entrusted to the banking circles in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou. Currently, Mr. Chen Guangfu has raised 10,000 yuan in Shanghai, and the other places are still raising funds. As for the methods of raising funds within the county, they include housing donations, voluntary donations, and individual solicitations. The fixed donation is 30,000 yuan allocated by the provincial government. The amount is not enough, and fundraising is still underway.</p>

<p>At the county's third county-wide administrative meeting, Yan Zhiqin and others proposed the proposal that the disaster victims in the eighth and ninth districts are crying out for food, how should we find ways to provide relief, and Xu Hongliang and others proposed the proposal to investigate the accumulated grain to prepare for disaster relief. After a combined review, the result is that the county will use the remaining funds from the accumulated grain from the past, and at the same time allocate the existing accumulated grain to the disaster areas for price leveling, and contact the provincial farmers bank to organize credit cooperatives in the county's disaster areas in order to provide loans. The review opinions have been approved, and Magistrate Ma has ordered Ye Qian, the former director of the finance bureau, to pay back the 451 yuan, 7 jiao, 2 fen, and 4 li that he owed in accumulated grain special funds. On the day before yesterday (29th), he specifically ordered Tao Zeji, the former section chief of the finance bureau, to quickly inform the family of the late Director Ye to pay off the debt by the deadline in order to emphasize the special funds, etc. As for the organization of credit cooperatives in the disaster areas to borrow money from the provincial farmers bank, he has ordered Zhang Chengzhong, the cooperative instructor, to go and contact the matter.</p>

<p>The buses traveling from Qingjiang to Suqian used to travel directly between the two stations, with one bus each day, which was convenient for passengers. Recently, due to the upper reaches of the abandoned Yellow River channel in the middle of the route being flooded, the water is five or six feet deep, no longer allowing passage through the river center as before. This river is located between Siyang County and Zhongyu, so the vehicles traveling from Qingjiang only reach Zhongxing, and the vehicles coming from Suqian only reach Siyang. Passengers from both sides must cross the abandoned Yellow River to transfer vehicles to Qingjiang and Suqian. Therefore, in order to facilitate both Qingjiang and Suqian, they use the Qingjiang-Siyang bus to transfer passengers to Pu every day, and at the same time use the Suqian-Siyang bus to transfer passengers to Suqian. Back and forth, both stations use the original bus to run twice, in order to maintain current traffic. However, it is much more inconvenient than before.</p>

<h3 id="e101">County Government Strictly Urges Defense Corps Donations <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the county's Defense Corps has made great contributions to safeguarding the area during the winter defense. However, donations have been sporadic, making it difficult to fund. Last year, stores such as Qichun Pavilion asked to be abolished because they could not afford it. At that time, a certain gentleman from the county party headquarters encouraged them, saying that from the second half of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he would find a way to reduce it appropriately. Therefore, from July of this year, the stores delayed paying donations. The county government's tax collectors repeatedly urged them without success. The day before yesterday, when the tax collector went to Qichun Pavilion to collect donations, the store owner Shao Xueling stated that he would not pay without a reduction. He also said that if he insisted on collecting donations, he could collect them from the county party headquarters. The tax collector returned to the government and reported the facts. County Magistrate Zhang became furious and immediately signed a warrant ordering the store owner Shao to be brought to justice. The Chamber of Commerce heard about it and Fang and Zhang went to see him to intercede for Shao. The County Magistrate said that Shao not only resisted donations, but also used such wording to public officials, which was absurd. This time, the stores' resistance to donations was found to be instigated by Shao. Since he was causing trouble, he would be sent to the Provincial Security Office for investigation. Fang and others agreed and left. It is now reported that the store is willing to pay the three months of unpaid donations, and the unpaid donations of all stores will also be paid in full.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, a Shanghai-Hangzhou freight train was traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou. When it reached Nanxing Station, a woman named Wu, 69 years old, who lived in Fengshanmen, was carrying a basket of noodles home from Nanxing Bridge. When she was crossing the tracks, the train arrived and it was too late to avoid her. She was knocked down and both legs were crushed, leaving a bloody mess. The railway police hired a car to rush her to the hospital for treatment. She died shortly after due to old age and excessive blood loss. The local court was notified to send officials to examine and coffin the body.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I was surprised to read an article in your newspaper's "County News" section on the 27th of this month entitled "Villagers in Jiashan Petition for the Removal of Wu Yue." According to reports, at 7:00 PM on the 25th of this month, Shen Lantai, the chief of the Didian Township in this area, was heavily involved in gambling and skimming profits. He requested that the police be sent to arrest him. The chief of this branch, for the sake of caution, led the chief police to investigate and arrest him. Two gamblers, Shen Rongqing and others, and gambling equipment were caught on the spot. Just as they were about to be taken to the bureau, fifteen or sixteen shots of wooden shell guns were fired from the roof of the township chief's house. The chief of this branch went out to investigate, but the shooter escaped in the darkness. At 8:00 AM on the 26th, following the county government's telegram order, he went to investigate with the core team. At that time, four gambling offenders, including Shen Santuan and others, were arrested and taken to the bureau and have now been sentenced. The shooter, Shen Qiada, is at large. The details have been reported to the county bureau and the county government for verification. As for the so-called "sending clothes to catch gamblers," "searching the entire village," "hitting the township chief with the butt of a gun," "injuring him all over," "gathering crowds to protest," and "villagers petitioning," all of these are not true. I am deeply concerned that this may confuse the audience and greatly affect the reputation of our bureau and the chief of the branch. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction to show the truth. Sincerely, Wu Yue, Chief of the Third Branch of the Jiashan County Public Security Bureau. October 28th.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Hai Yuan New Ship Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Arrived at Songkou at 1 PM and Docked at Gaochang Temple at 3 PM</p>
<p>First Voyage to Guangzhou and Hong Kong Scheduled for the 12th</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's newly built Hai Yuan ship in England arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at the Jiangnan Shipyard Wharf in Gaochang Temple. It will be sailed into the dry dock this morning for inspection of its machinery. The ship's crew has also been assigned by the company. After formal acceptance, it will sail to Guangzhou and Hong Kong for the first time on the morning of the 12th. The Hai Ting and Hai Li ships have also been completed and sailed to China, while the Hai Zhen ship is still under construction. Approximately one ship will arrive at the port every three weeks. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e106">Construction Process <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>In order to develop its business, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed 400,000 pounds from the Central Boxer Indemnity Committee to build four seagoing vessels. After approval by the Ministry of Transportation, it signed a contract with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee and drafted designs. The bidding and construction in England went smoothly. The four ships all have a deadweight tonnage of more than 3,000 tons. The Hai Yuan and Hai Li ships were built by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson &amp; Co. in Newcastle, while the Hai Ting and Hai Zhen ships were built by Barclay Curle &amp; Co. in Glasgow. Both factories have a long-standing reputation in the British shipbuilding industry.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Voyage to China <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Hai Yuan wheel, estimated to weigh 3,200 tons, was the first to be built. It was launched on July 20th of this year, with the wife of our country's Minister to the UK, Guo Taiqi, performing the bottle-throwing ceremony. The interior engineering was completed on September 13th, and it departed from England the following day, driven by the construction company to Shanghai for delivery. Two engineers, Huang Zonglun and Li Changwen, who were sent by the China Merchants Bureau for practical training, returned to the country with the ship. After leaving England, the ship traveled at a speed of ten knots per hour (approximately 33 Chinese miles) non-stop. It passed the Strait of Gibraltar on September 21st, arrived in Port Said on the 29th, contacted the Suez Canal Company, and crossed the canal the next day. It passed Aden on October 6th, Colombo on the 15th, Singapore on the 21st, and Hong Kong on the 27th. It finally arrived at the Wusongkou at 1:00 PM yesterday, covering a total distance of approximately 18,000 nautical miles in 48 days.</p>

<p>After the Hai Yuan wheel arrived at Wusongkou at 1:00 PM yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau dispatched a pre-hired pilot to guide it into the port. It passed the Huazhan at 1:30 PM and the Bund at 2:30 PM. The ship sounded its whistle in salute to the bureau's entrance, and the bureau's staff gathered on the balcony to watch. The ship sailed directly to the Jiangnan Shipyard at Gaochangmiao, mooring at the dock at approximately 3:00 PM. The bureau specially sent the Deputy Director of Shipping, Zhao Yuntai, to welcome it.</p>

<p>The voyage to China was the responsibility of the construction company. The ship's crew consisted of eight British individuals, including the captain, first mate, second mate, telegraph operator, and four engineers. In addition to Huang and Li, the Chinese crew members returning to the country, there were also eight Chinese laborers temporarily hired in the Netherlands as stokers, four sailors, and four assistants. After arriving in Shanghai, all Chinese and foreign crew members were either given funds to disband or return to their respective countries by the company.</p>
<h3 id="e110">A Glimpse of the New Ship <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The new ship was flying the national flags of China and England, as well as the international flag, which was quite a magnificent sight. The ship was 343 feet long, 47 feet wide, 25 feet high to the upper deck, and 17 feet 6 inches high to the main deck. It had a carrying capacity of 3,200 tons. The bottom of the ship was painted red, the hull was painted black, and inlaid with red lines. The words "Hai Yuan" were made of bronze-colored metal and placed on both sides of the ship's waist, which was very eye-catching. The outer layers of the cabins were painted white, and the interior had eleven large dining rooms, twenty-two passenger seats, sixteen official cabins, and fifty-three passenger seats. The rest were economy class passenger seats. The layout of each department was magnificent and the equipment was also very perfect.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Mr. Li's Interview <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Li Changwen, who returned with the ship, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency on board, "We were sent to British shipyards for practical training, and there were six of us in total, including naval architects Huang Zonglun, machine engineers Zhang Guoquan, Shi Ruichang, and myself, as well as Zhou Yanjin and Wang Chengzhu, two graduates from the merchant marine school. Our group of people departed from Shanghai on May 19th and arrived in London on the afternoon of June 23rd. We were designated by the China Merchants Bureau's new ship construction supervision committee members, Wu Daming and Shi Gan, with myself and Huang and Wang to practice at the Newcastle shipyard, and Zhang, Zhou, and Shi to practice at the Glasgow shipyard. The Hai Yuan wheel was launched on July 27th, with Mrs. Guo, the Minister's wife, performing the bottle-throwing ceremony. It was completed on September 13th and departed for China on the 14th. Mr. Huang and I returned to the country with the ship. The weather was not good along the way, and there were no major storms. We did not stop at any ports along the way except for Port Said, because Port Said is the northern entrance to the Suez Canal, and ships crossing the river must first contact the canal company, so it was necessary to stop. This trip took a total of 48 days. The other three ships have also been completed one after another, and one ship can arrive in Shanghai every three weeks thereafter."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Overseas Chinese Not Onboard <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Hai Yuan wheel going to the Netherlands to carry unemployed overseas Chinese back to the country was mandated by central and Ministry of Transportation telegrams. Therefore, when entering the port at Wusong, the bureau still claimed that there were more than one hundred overseas Chinese from the Netherlands coming aboard. When the ship arrived at the Jiangnan factory, it was learned that not a single person was onboard. The reason for not carrying them was that when the Hai Yuan wheel left England for Shanghai, the shipbuilding commissioner stationed in the UK received another telegram from Minister Zhu, instructing the wheel to go to the Netherlands to load a large number of overseas Chinese (a total of more than 500 people) returning to the country. However, at that time, the Hai Yuan had not yet been handed over to the bureau. The British captain, who was responsible for driving the ship to Shanghai, believed that because the contracted price was limited, the ship would need to use more coal if it sailed to the Netherlands, and there was no use for a large number of Chinese on board, as there was no large amount of money paid. Therefore, he refused to go to the Netherlands to carry them, causing a large number of overseas Chinese to look forward to it in the Netherlands, but they were never able to return to the country. When the ship sailed, the German embassy sent a letter requesting that several overseas Chinese be carried back, but because the power was in the hands of the British (who managed the entire ship), it could not be done. However, this intention was not telegraphed to Shanghai to clarify, causing the bureau to believe that there were overseas Chinese coming along.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Assignment of Crew Members <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The bureau originally advocated hiring Chinese shipmasters for the new ship. However, because the ship had to pass through Hong Kong, it was only allowed to enter the port if examined by the Hong Kong authorities. And, because the ship needed to set sail urgently, it was decided by the bureau affairs meeting to temporarily employ foreign shipmasters. Captain Jonathan of the Xin Jiangtian ship was transferred to fill the position. Chen Bangda was appointed as the first mate, Liu Chuansen as the second mate, Xu Hanqing as the third mate, and the engine captain was hired from England for a fixed term of six months. Ni Shunlai was the first engineer, Zheng Rongfa the second engineer, and Yan Yi the third engineer. All have been assigned and will take office after acceptance.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Scheduled Departure <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Hai Yuan wheel is scheduled to enter the dry dock this morning. The bureau will send personnel to inspect the machinery and repaint the hull. It is scheduled to dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the 10th of this month to hold an acceptance ceremony, while inviting Chinese and foreign guests to visit. The next day, it will host merchants and people from all walks of life to visit at the same location. It is also scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Guangdong for the first time on the morning of the 12th, and dock at You Tou and other ports. In the future, it will sail once every two weeks, carrying both passengers and cargo.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Sinking of Hai Ping Steamer of Haichang Company <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Total Loss of Ship and Cargo</p>
<p>Company Received Telegram Yesterday</p>
<p>Truth Being Thoroughly Investigated</p>
<p>Haichang Steamship Company, located on Rue du Consulat, French Concession, owns the Hai Shun, Hai Ping, and Hai Chang wheels, operating between Shanghai and Yingkou. After the Hai Ping wheel went from Shanghai to Yingkou last time, it docked at the South Manchuria Railway Company Wharf, loaded with 2,200 tons of Fushun coal. At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, because it was fully loaded, it sailed from Yingkou, bound for Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive at the port for unloading on November 6th.</p>
<p>Sunk in Collision Unexpectedly, Hai Ping lifted anchor at 9:30 AM yesterday, leaving the wharf. Just as it was starting up, a tanker from the Asiatic Petroleum Company approached the Hai Ping wheel. The wheel failed to avoid it, causing the mid-ship to be violently struck by the Asiatic wheel. It immediately breached, and water poured in. Because it was heavily loaded, it sank within minutes.</p>
<p>Total Loss of Ship and Cargo The Hai Ping wheel sank outside the South Manchuria Wharf. The 2,200 tons of Fushun coal in the hold also went into the port with the wheel. Fortunately, there were no passengers in the hold. All the crew members, because they were close to the wharf after the accident, were able to escape to shore, but everyone's personal and private belongings were lost and could not be retrieved.</p>
<p>Reported to Shanghai The owner of the Haichang Steamship is Zhu Zhe, the first mate is Tang Zhuangxing, the second mate is Song Yuanjian, and the comprador is Liu Zhenxi. Haichang Company in Shanghai received a telegram from shipowner Zhu Zhe and the Yingkou branch yesterday afternoon, and telegraphed to Yingkou overnight to inquire about the truth of the collision, requesting a detailed report.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Loss The Hai Ping wheel has a capacity of 2,600 tons and travels the Shanghai-Beiyang line. The wheel has 120,000 yuan of marine insurance in various companies of the Joint Shipping Insurance Association. Yesterday afternoon, the company received the news and notified various insurance companies, and also notified the coal owners. The insurance company must conduct a detailed investigation of the collision to determine the responsibility for the accident. As for the loss of cargo, the ship and the belongings and luggage of the crew, the loss is estimated at around 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Has Not Recognized the Puppet State</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency October 31st News, the Consulate of Nicaragua in Shanghai issued a statement to the News Agency stating that the Nicaraguan Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Gadowinkel, received a special instruction from Dr. Espinoza, Vice President of the Republic of Nicaragua, stating that the telegraphic report issued by the Japanese Associated Press on October 15th regarding the Republic of Nicaragua's recognition of Manchukuo is completely inaccurate and unfounded. Dr. Espinoza declared that he has never expressed opinions on this matter or any other political issues. He only came as a representative of the Red Cross and has no political function. Therefore, he considers this false report, which is likely to cause misunderstandings between Nicaragua and China, a regrettable matter, because Nicaragua always holds deep friendship and sympathy for China, etc.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu and Others Welcomed Him at the Station</p>
<p>Minister of Military Affairs and Acting Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch Council, Mr. He Yingqin, came to Shanghai to mourn the funeral of his mother-in-law, the late Mrs. Wang. He visited friends for several days, and finished everything yesterday, taking the 1:30 PM Shanghai-Nanjing Express train to Beijing. Only a few attendants traveled with him. Mr. He left Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and the people from all parties did not find out about it in advance. Therefore, those who went to the station to see him off were only Mayor Wu Tiecheng's secretary Wang Changchun, Security Director Yang Hu, Chief of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau Liang Fuchu, and Xu Yuanfang, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Two Roads. After Mr. He arrives in Beijing, he will inspect the subordinate agencies and schools of the Ministry of Military Affairs before returning to Peiping.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Representatives of Chinese Cotton Mills Returned to Shanghai <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to the News Agency, the National Federation of Chinese Cotton Mills, because the government is scheduled to increase the unified tax on cotton yarn by 20% starting today, held a general meeting on October 28th and immediately appointed nine representatives, including Guo Shun, Su Taiyu, Tang Xinghai, Li Shengbo, and Zhang Zemin, to petition in Beijing. Now the representatives have returned to Shanghai one after another, but Mr. Chen Zemin, Director-General of the National Federation of Chinese Cotton Mills, has been detained for business and is still in the capital. According to a representative who returned from the petition yesterday, after the colleagues took the train to Beijing on the evening of the 28th, the Central Political Council was holding a meeting to review the issue of increasing the unified tax on cotton yarn on the 29th. Upon hearing the news, the colleagues immediately went to the Central Political Council to petition. Mr. Sun Zhesheng ordered three representatives to attend the meeting to present the case. The petition delegation appointed Guo Shun, Tang Xinghai, and Su Taiyu as the three representatives to attend the meeting to painfully state the difficulties. Afterwards, it was heard that the Central Political Council had decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance for reconsideration. The colleagues then returned to Shanghai, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e119">New Stamps Will Be Affixed Starting Today, and Old Regulations Still Apply <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Old Stamps Cannot Be Affixed Again, Awaiting Registration for Exchange</p>
<p>New Stamp Tax Law Has Been Passed But Not Yet Implemented</p>
<p>The new pagoda-shaped stamps printed by the Ministry of Finance will be available for sale at post offices across the country starting today. However, regarding this matter, merchants in this city have a misunderstanding that the new stamp tax law will also be implemented on the same day, causing businesses to repeatedly call the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce yesterday to inquire. Now, Yan Esheng, Secretary of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, officially issued the following explanation:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Regulations Valid <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that the stamps currently affixed are handled in accordance with the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations of the National Government of the Republic of China. The regulations consist of nine articles, dividing the stamped items into four categories, including fifteen types in the first category, fourteen types in the second category, forty-five types in the third category, and four types in the fourth category, for a total of seventy-eight types. The new stamp tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan has not yet been promulgated and implemented by the National Government, and chambers of commerce in various places are striving to amend it, so it cannot be applied, of course.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Old Stamps Registration <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>As for the original old stamp tax stamps, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce fought for exchanging the old for the new to the Ministry, and the Ministry of Finance has approved it. After registration, the new stamps will be exchanged in installments, but the registration and exchange methods are being drafted by the Ministry of Finance and have not yet been announced. Recently, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed to urge the prompt promulgation. But what can be said is that old stamps cannot be affixed from November 1st. However, they are not discarded, and after the Ministry of Finance promulgates the registration method, the new stamps will be exchanged in installments.</p>
<h3 id="e122">No Need to Re-paste <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Affixing new stamps from November 1st refers to newly created vouchers. If old vouchers have already been pasted with old stamps, there is no need to re-paste new stamps. For example, if this year's account book has already been pasted with old stamps at the beginning of the year, it is of course still valid and can be pasted with new stamps at the beginning of the following year after the end of the year, which has been clearly instructed by the Ministry of Finance by telegram.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Inspection Method <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>From November 1st, after the new stamps are sold by the post office, all matters related to the inspection of stamps will be handled by the governments of each province, city, and county. Personnel will be dispatched by the provincial stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus to conduct random inspections at any time. Cases of violations of the stamp tax regulations will be handled by local judicial organs. The Stamp Tax Case Review Committee established previously also ended at the end of October. However, matters related to the inspection of stamps in the Shanghai Concession have always been handled by the Concession Investigation Department and sent to the court for trial.

<p>Since stamp tax cases will be tried by the court in the future, it is necessary to study carefully the interpretation of the stamp tax regulations to decide what should be pasted and what does not need to be pasted,</p>

<p>instead of having the former Review Committee consider the circumstances and handle them leniently. The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce Commercial Monthly has compiled a book of answers to questions about stamp tax, containing various instructions, approvals, and interpretations of the Ministry of Finance and the Stamp Tax Bureau on stamp tax issues, which is very detailed. The content includes 84 clauses and also includes the full text of the Provisional Regulations. Each book is sold for only 15 cents, which is the most accurate reference book on stamp tax.</p>

<p>Please Order the Customs Not to Impose Non-Closing Penalties Again</p>
<p>Pilots Went to Beijing Last Night to Petition the Court</p>
<p>After the China Pilot Management Committee announced the Song-Han Pilot Regulations, the Jianghai Customs implemented a refusal to unqualified pilots. The shipping companies gathered to discuss the matter and decided to suspend operations and telegraphed an appeal. A joint pilot petition group went to Beijing last night to petition. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Management Committee Announcement <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Ke Fair, Director of the Song-Han District Pilot Office, announced: "1. From October 1, 1934, all personnel are under the jurisdiction of this Management Committee. Without the permission of this Management Committee, they may not accept contract employment from any shipping company. Please pay attention. When this office sends a pilot out to serve, it fills out a pilot dispatch form. When the ship is closed, please take this form and the practice certificate to the Shanghai Port Affairs Bureau for verification. 2. To whom it may concern, all personnel are under the jurisdiction of this Management Committee as short-term pilots. If anyone comes to this office, please report to the registry."</p>

<p>The shipping companies decided that before the Jianghai Customs has resolved the agreement between the two parties, it must appoint the pilot of the Pilot Management Committee, otherwise it will not be allowed to close the customs. Therefore, after the suspension of operations, the Shipping Association has drafted a telegram yesterday, which was sealed by Chairman Yu Qiaqing, and will be telegraphed to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan today, requesting the Customs not to impose penalties for non-closure until the agreement between the two parties has been resolved. At the same time, the letter was sent to the Inspector General of Customs for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Pilot Petition <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Ruiqing and 56 other pilots who failed the examination of the China Pilot Management Committee all hold licenses from the Naval Pilot Training Institute. They organized the Song-Han Joint Pilot Petition Group and yesterday appointed representatives Feng Yuqing, Zhang Zicong, and Zhang Fu, and ten others to bring a presentation and took the Shanghai-Nanjing night express to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of the Navy. It was also decided that Zhang Ruiqing would be appointed as a representative to petition the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government today.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Petition Content <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The petition is to maintain the shipping industry, protect livelihoods, restore national rights, and prevent foreigners from trampling on them in disguise. I believe that the pilotage of various ports in our country has been almost entirely occupied by foreigners, and now if there is only a remaining part, it is only the Yangtze River line. Looking at modern countries, there is hardly an example of allowing foreigners to serve as pilots within its territory. Although the lives of the representatives who serve as Yangtze River pilots have never been slightly affected by foreign forces, they have long been saddened by the sight of foreign forces infringing on navigation rights. Recently, the establishment of the Pilot Management Committee has given the power to foreigners from the Customs. First, the pilots in our Song-Han District have been ravaged and arbitrarily acted, illegally revoking the qualifications of the representatives, monopolizing shipping affairs, and trying to gradually erode the navigation rights of the Yangtze River inland waterway, so as to expand their imperialist forces and try to annex China. The representatives are concerned about their livelihoods and the national rights. In addition to the petitions that have been submitted to the Yuan requesting assistance in saving the case, representatives were specially sent to the Yuan for petitions, and it is requested that the petition be examined and transferred for prevention (omitted). In short, if the Pilot Management Committee allows foreigners to visit, the brutality of foreigners will be more unbridled. This will not only harm the livelihoods of the pilots in our Song-Han District and suffer from their poison, but also be a conspiracy by foreigners and a unilateral act of the country. If it is not quickly stopped, national rights will not be guaranteed. The representatives are forced to jointly present the details of the situation, requesting examination and rapid prevention of the illegal acts of the Pilot Management Committee, and asking for rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Shipowners as Pilots <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Since the Chunhe wheel of the Hefeng Steamship Company was refused closure by the Jianghai Customs because the pilot was unqualified, yesterday, the Tongli wheel of the Zhengji Steamship Company sailed from Tianjin to Jiangyin with cargo. The pilot of the wheel was also unqualified. The company ordered the shipowner to pilot the ship himself. The Jianghai Customs approved it, and it sailed to Jiangyin yesterday afternoon. In addition, Chen Tianjun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and a member of the China Pilot Management Committee, has arrived in Shanghai from Austria.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Two Announcements from Jianghai Customs <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Regulations on Taxable Goods in Luggage</p>
<p>Restrictions on Passengers Carrying Silver Dollars and Copper Coins</p>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Berlede, Commissioner of Customs, issued joint announcements yesterday. They are recorded as follows: (1) For the purpose of complying with the order to stipulate that the import tax on taxable goods carried in passengers' luggage is limited to one gold unit and the export tax is limited to two national currencies, and the transit tax for domestic travel is exempted if it is less than five national currencies, Announcement No. 1395. In accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, it is hereby stipulated that the minimum amount of tax levied by the customs baggage inspection team on taxable goods carried in passengers' luggage is one gold unit for import tax and one national currency for export tax per passenger, and that all amounts less than this amount shall be exempted. As for taxable items in luggage traveling to various commercial ports in China, if the amount of transit tax per passenger is less than five national currencies, they will be exempted from taxation, etc. This shall be complied with and notified to all merchants. (2) For the purpose of complying with the order to revise the limited number of copper coins and silver coins carried by passengers, Announcement No. 1393. According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, the original stipulation of 10,000 single copper coins per passenger has now been changed to 5,000 coins, and the original stipulation that silver coins, whether single or double, that are not inferior or light coins, whose number is within 500 coins, is allowed for merchants to transport freely, is now changed to within 300 coins, which is allowed for merchants to transport freely. This shall be complied with and notified to all merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Owners of Various Industries in This City Oppose Landlords Paying Donations for Tenants <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Not Only Does It Not Conform to the Regulations</p>
<p>And it Adds Many Losses</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau previously issued a public notice that the housing donation for residential houses will be revised to 12% of the rent, which will still be borne half by the landlord and half by the tenant. However, if the tenant delays in paying the housing donation in the future, the landlord shall be responsible for paying it, and the donation paid on behalf of the tenant shall be offset when collecting the rent, etc., as seen in the previous report. Now the owners in the two districts of Shanghai South and Zhabei believe that the above-mentioned notice is inconsistent with the revised housing donation rules published by the municipal government. Citizens Wu Baodi, Xu Zuoliang, Wang Binyan, Shen Lianfang, Wang Ling, Yao Ziruo, Gu Lugui, Jia Jiying, Yu Baojing, Ling Bohua, Mao Jingchou, Zhang Yi, etc., jointly petitioned the Finance Bureau to revoke it. The original text reads: "The petition is that the landlord has no obligation to pay the housing donation for the tenant in arrears. It is sincerely hoped that it will be revoked quickly to conform to the regulations and show fairness. On September 30th of this year, 12% will be collected according to the rent, which will still be borne half by the owner and half by the tenant. It is also stipulated that if the tenant delays in paying the housing donation in the future, the landlord shall be responsible for paying it, and the donation paid on behalf of the tenant shall be offset when collecting the rent, etc., which is surprising. It has been found that the market has declined in recent years, and the social economy has suddenly become exhausted. The rent reduction movement of tenants is like a whirlwind. The difficulty in collecting rent from landlords is also a pressing issue. In such a situation, we hope that the government authorities will sympathize with the difficulties of the people and reduce the donation rate to provide relief. However, reading this notice, the housing donation for residential houses must be increased by 2% starting this winter. The citizens know that they cannot afford to take on the burden at this time, but since it has been approved by the central government, even if they object, it will be ineffective, so they have to remain silent in pain. The only consolation is that the landlord and tenant each bear half of the housing donation, and the half that the landlord should pay is paid by the tenant and deducted from the rent that should be paid, which is clearly stated in Article 11 of the revised rules for collecting housing donations published by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Since its implementation, it has been quite convenient, and the tenant has no loss in paying the half of the housing donation on behalf of the landlord because the rent can be deducted. As for whether the tenant's donation is delayed, it depends entirely on whether the collector's collection is effective or not. The landlord is absolutely not responsible. If the loss of the tenant's arrears is made the responsibility of the landlord, it is not only inconsistent with the regulations, but the collector will definitely not be willing to do his best to collect the donation. Because the housing donation owed by the tenant will be compensated by the landlord in the future, there is no need to urge the tenant to pay it. Although the notice states that the donation paid on behalf of the tenant shall be offset when collecting the rent, it is not known that the police are assisting in the collection of housing donations, and the public power is the backing. Even for tenants who cannot afford to pay, they have to be allowed to delay. If they delay the donation to the public, they must owe a lot of rent. How can the landlord pay for them again? If the tenant escapes for this reason, from whom will the compensation be obtained? As a result, the landlord will incur many losses. We owners cannot remain silent in the face of such an obligation. Therefore, we jointly petition the Yuan Bureau to review it and quickly issue an order to revoke the section in this notice regarding the tenant's delayed payment of the housing donation, which requires the landlord to pay it and offset it when collecting the rent, so as to conform to the regulations and show fairness.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Provincial Committee Surveys Drought Conditions in County <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Various districts of Shanghai County suffered from drought in the summer of this year and were damaged by wind, rain, and snow. The county government successively appointed members to investigate and telegraphed the provincial departments, requesting them to send personnel to re-survey immediately. After receiving the report, the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction immediately dispatched disaster survey members. Chen Guanliu was dispatched by the Department of Civil Affairs, Hou Mingen by the Department of Finance, and Yao Yongping by the Department of Construction. The members have arrived in the county one after another and set off together to various districts in the past two days to conduct on-site re-surveys, so that the provincial departments can determine the autumn harvest yield and devise relief measures.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Danyang Drought Disaster Begging Letter <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Bi Jingqian, the magistrate of Danyang County, Yin Dieqing, the chairman of the accounting branch, and Jiang Kesheng, the chairman of the drought relief association, issued a begging letter for the disaster victims this year, saying: Respectfully, since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain for three seasons in our county. Although the river basin area has been rescued by rental machines, it is still not fruitful due to the lack of rain. The mountainous areas and fields far from the riverbanks are even more unable to be irrigated due to the drying up of ditches and ponds, resulting in no harvest. According to the survey results, the total disaster area in the county is about 70% or more, and the loss is more than 8 million yuan. The total number of disaster victims is more than 210,000. Therefore, the articles and telegrams requesting relief from various villages and towns are coming in one after another, and the representatives pleading for relief are constantly on the road. We think that our county is located near the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and was originally known for its poverty. In recent years, disasters have continued to occur, and the vitality of the rural areas has been almost lost. Since this year's severe drought, the livelihood of the poor has been cut off, and the lack of food and starvation are now heard every day. The state of displacement and wandering is unbearable to witness. Alas, the fertile fields have all become red land, and the remnants of the people will become starving corpses. This is truly an unprecedented disaster in a hundred years and the greatest catastrophe for the people. In the blink of an eye, the cold winter is approaching, and hunger and cold will come together. If we do not seek relief urgently, the weak will have no one to turn to and will die, and the brave will take risks, which may hinder public security. Although we have repeatedly reported the situation to the provincial government, we have first issued urgent relief to help them. However, the disaster area this year is vast, and the provincial treasury is limited. The construction compensation is intended to replace relief with work, which is also a slow solution. Jingqian is unable to perform his duties and lacks the means to provide relief. He is making a call for help to celebrate the hope of recovery. We have always admired □□'s warm concern and have been troubled by the suffering of the people. We have specially detailed the disaster situation, hoping to show compassion for the hungry people who are crying and begging in the fields, and generously issue food and clothing to prolong their lives. Then, not only will the re-creators pray with incense, but also those who are in charge of the pastoral care will also be grateful beyond measure. We respectfully submit this letter and hope that you will consider it.</p>

<p>Bi Jingqian, the magistrate of Danyang County, and Yin Heiqing, the chairman of the Relief Affairs Branch, came to Shanghai to beg for relief. Jiang Zhengchan, a director of the Danyang Fellow Villagers Association, and Jiang Kesheng, a supervisor, first proposed donating money at a banquet of the association's representative Pei Yuanding. Nearly 10,000 yuan was immediately determined on the spot. The association also intends to launch a toast to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a 95-year-old director of the association, and solicit the names of Mr. Ma's friends and disciples to initiate the event. Dean Yu and others have strongly agreed and will write for relief on behalf of Mr. Ma. The birthday gifts will also be transferred to the hometown relief fund. Mr. Ma is concerned about his hometown and is meticulous in every way. The association has been contacting various parties and all say that it is going smoothly. It has convened another meeting to organize a disaster relief committee for the drought in the hometown. Sui Jikun and others were appointed as members. The committee meeting was held immediately, and Pei Yuanding was elected as the chairman, and Han Yingqi and Dong Xiaoqian were elected as the vice-chairmen. He Binshi was hired as the chief auditor, and Lin Weisheng was hired as the director of general affairs. Liu Zhemin was hired as the director of investigation and release. Dong Xiaoqian also served as the director of fundraising. The various disaster relief matters will be handled immediately, in coordination with the Danyang Relief Affairs Branch. This is truly good news for the disaster victims of Danyang.</p>

<p>And Orders Ten Audit Regulations</p>
<p>Since the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China passed a resolution at this year's provincial representatives' conference to reorganize the administrative department, everything has been progressing actively. The Ministry of Interior also attaches great importance to the society's affairs and actively supervises it. It has specially formulated ten regulations for the Ministry of Interior to inspect the accounting of the Chinese Red Cross Society and specially appointed Mr. Pan Xulun, director of the Lixin Accounting Firm in this city, as the society's permanent auditor to handle matters in accordance with the promulgated regulations. It is understood that the Lixin Accounting Firm was previously entrusted by the Red Cross Society's board of directors to undertake the society's audit work for five years. The Ministry of Interior previously believed that the auditor should be appointed by the ministry, so the society terminated the original appointment of the accountant. However, because the Lixin Accounting Firm's audit work has always been serious, it was still appointed to this position. The ten inspection regulations are recorded below: (Ministry of Interior's Regulations for Inspecting the Accounting of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China) 1. The Ministry of Interior has specially formulated these regulations in order to consolidate the financial foundation of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China. 2.

The scope of inspection shall include all movable and immovable property, account books, vouchers, and related documents of the society. If temporarily designated by the ministry, the inspection shall be carried out in detail on the designated part. The foregoing inspection shall include the society's general headquarters and its affiliated first, second, and third hospitals, as well as other temporary agencies. 5. The points that should be paid special attention to during the implementation of the inspection are as follows: (A) Whether the preparation of all documents and account books of the society is appropriate and can reflect the society's entire true financial situation. (B) Whether all income and expenditure of the society are excessive or improper, and whether there is any violation or concealment of government laws and regulations and the society's accounting regulations. (D) Whether the society's accounting organization is sound. 6. The specially appointed accountant, after being designated by the ministry or entrusted by the society, may handle the following matters: (A) Various investigations, certifications, and appraisals. (B) Methods and procedures for preparing budgets and final accounts. (C) Methods for handling accounting matters and classification of accounting subjects. (D) The format of all accounting books, forms, bills, and vouchers. 7. In addition to the society's overall financial situation of property income and expenditure, the report shall include detailed explanations of the various items listed in Article 5 of these regulations. The contents of the foregoing report shall not be announced without the approval of the ministry. 8. The inspection fee of the specially appointed accountant shall be paid by the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, and the amount shall be determined separately. 9. All accounting laws and regulations related to the society shall be copied and sent to the specially appointed accountant by the ministry or the society at any time for information. 10.

<h3 id="e147">Grand Gathering of Engineers' Society at the International Hotel Before Opening <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers holds a regular monthly meeting with lectures and dinners. The night before last (the 30th), with the new completion of the 22-story International Hotel in the new building of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, a meeting was specially held in the hotel's restaurant. The members considered the building to be the tallest building in East Asia, and its engineering equipment was very impressive. They registered in advance and brought relatives and friends, totaling nearly 300 people. Before 7 o'clock, the members and their families who arrived at the meeting were shoulder to shoulder, and the threshold was blocked. After briefly visiting the magnificent and luxurious decorations, all of which were unprecedented, the guests were amazed. After taking their seats, the chairman, Mr. Xu Peihuang, first reported the purpose of the meeting and introduced Mr. Sa Fujun, the director of the Ministry of Railways, to give a lecture. Mr. Sa was ordered to go to Europe and the United States to inspect road administration, and described in detail the progress of transportation and the development and perfection of railway engineering in various European and American countries, which was extremely thorough. Next, Mr. Wu Daquan of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society was invited to speak. Mr. Wu said that since the opening of the sea ban and trade in China, there has been no institution in the country to treat international guests. Even Shanghai, which has the closest relationship, is the same. All the reception institutions for international guests are operated by foreigners. The colleagues have seen this and therefore spared no huge project to operate an international hotel to make up for this deficiency. Next, Mr. Qian Xinzhi was invited to speak. Mr. Qian explained that the association has been operating this large building for three years, and fortunately it has been completed. It cannot be said that it is not a major success in Chinese engineering. This 22-story building is 300 feet high and the foundation is 120 feet deep. The land price and construction cost 4.2 million yuan. All the projects are managed by various experts, without any slightness. Although the effort, time, and resources spent are many, the results obtained are satisfactory to all parties, and the colleagues are even more gratified. Now, to operate the hotel, funds are raised separately to establish a joint-stock limited company, organize a board of directors, and hire a manager to take full responsibility. From the financial perspective, investing in industry is the most stable business, and the progress of engineering relies on financial assistance. I sincerely hope that the financial and engineering circles will cooperate sincerely and unite to promote the progress of social undertakings, from an agricultural country to an industrial country. Next, Mr. Sun Liji, the architectural engineer of the association, reported the construction process. Mr. Wu Qingquan, the mechanical and electrical engineer of the association, reported the mechanical and electrical and sanitary fire-fighting equipment, which was very detailed. Finally, Vice-Chairman Wang Shengshan delivered a speech, saying that today, financiers and engineers are gathered together to enjoy a grand discussion, which is a very good phenomenon of mutual cooperation and is extremely gratifying. The operation and construction of the International Hotel has been very long, and the financial resources spent have been immeasurable. From the foundation laying to the completion, no work has been relaxed. This kind of down-to-earth business is by no means comparable to any speculative business, which shows the stability of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society in handling business. Our engineering circles are all optimistic about its success, and we will study and attack each other to expand the future of the engineering circles. After the meeting, it was 9:45 pm. The lights were turned on again, and the music began. The members began to dance socially, with hairpins and shadows, and the gathering was joyful. It ended at 10:30 pm.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Shanghai Municipal Council Formulates Isolation Measures After Importing Cattle <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has been implementing isolation measures for cattle in registered dairy farms for two years, which has been quite effective. However, there are no isolation facilities for cattle imported from overseas. Recently, a large number of cattle have been imported. If each dairy farm is allowed to handle it by itself, there is a risk of spreading diseases. The Director of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council therefore made a suggestion to the Health Committee that in the future, each factory must have a certificate from the veterinarian or other official agency of the place of origin when importing cattle, proving that there are no certain diseases prevalent in the area. After the Municipal Council's veterinarian inspects it again, the factory can pick it up. Generally, those who come from reliable places of origin and have certificates are generally safe. The isolation effect can also be achieved during the transportation period on large ships. However, in order to meet the needs of isolation after arriving in Shanghai, it is planned to temporarily use the upper floor of the slaughterhouse in the next few years, and at the same time, necessary precautions will be taken for meat products. This proposal was reviewed by the committee and referred to the Board of Directors for approval after consulting the veterinarian's report and statistics. The Board of Directors has already approved it on Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Shanghai Municipal Council to Hold Rickshaw Puller Registration <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>

Hongkou, corner of Wusong Road and Bazilu; 2. Xinzha, workshop of the Public Works Department on Shunde Road (near Maigen Road Bridge). For each vehicle with a valid license owned by a public rickshaw registered owner, three rickshaw pullers can be recommended. When issuing the November license, the Municipal Council will also issue a recommendation form for each vehicle. The vehicle owner should select rickshaw pullers who are often hired and physically strong, and fill in the vehicle owner's name on the form. Vehicle owner's license number. Rickshaw puller's name. Age. Native place. Shanghai residence. etc. The rickshaw pullers should go to the registration place according to the location, date, and time specified on the form. The registration period is from November 19 to December 15. Also, if the recommendation form is lost, it will not be reissued. Holding a recommendation form does not necessarily mean that a rickshaw puller's license will be issued. It will still be issued after verification. The regulations for public rickshaw puller licenses have been seen in the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette on July 18 and the newspapers on July 13.</p>

<p>Four People Burned</p>
<p>The Mainland Rubber Factory, located at No. 876 Taopeng Road, had an accident at about 11 am yesterday. When the factory workers were mixing hot cover oil and gasoline on the open space in the factory to prepare to paint rubber shoes, it happened that Mrs. Tang, a neighbor on the left, was also cooking next to the open space. Suddenly, a gust of wind carried the sparks from the stove into the gasoline pot. As a result, the pot caught fire immediately, and the flames soared. The workers Qian Heming, Zhao Yuexin, and Jiang Jinbao, who were working nearby, were burned by the gasoline first, and Mrs. Tang was also affected. Fortunately, the location was open, and the factory found out early, so it was put out immediately. However, the above four people were seriously injured, so the factory called the fire station and dispatched an ambulance to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Grand Occasion of the Hengshe Charity Opera for Disaster Relief <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Hengshe Society on Avenue Edward VII, deeply concerned about the severe drought disaster in various provinces, initiated a charity opera performance to raise funds. The performance, held at the Grand Theater on Second Avenue for two days starting last night, saw all tickets sold by society members. The opera selections were also performed by society members, achieving excellent results. Last night marked the first day of the performance. From 6 p.m., Second Avenue was bustling with traffic, reaching its peak. Latecomers could barely find standing room. The opera performances by various amateur actors were highly focused, earning much applause. The audience was extremely satisfied. The society's initiative to raise funds through opera for disaster relief, benefiting the poor, was particularly commendable. It is said that there is another day of performance today, with even more精彩劇目 than yesterday. It is expected that the audience will be even more crowded.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The New Buddhification of the Huainan Reclamation Area <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>In the newly reclaimed areas of Huainan, ditches, roads, and wells are gradually being established in an orderly manner. The tenant farmers are increasingly numerous, all coming from other counties, with different languages, customs, and preferences. Therefore, a culture of mutual maintenance and assistance has not yet formed in their communal life. Mr. Tao Shuchan, an employee of the Yuhua Company in Dongtai, has been studying Buddhism for some time. Recently, he initiated the establishment of a Buddhist Layman's Association, carefully constructing a Buddhist hall. He gathers his colleagues and leads the general tenant farmers to recite Buddhist scriptures during their spare time, without hindering their regular duties. This aims to establish a central belief for the new villagers in the coastal area. Mr. Zhu Jingci of the neighboring Dafeng Company strongly supports this initiative, purchasing a complete Song Dynasty Qisha Edition of the Buddhist Canon for the association, providing convenience for recitation and study. These two gentlemen advocate the Buddhist principles of charity and selflessness, aiming to save the world from the current rampant flood of selfishness. This is truly important. In the future, if Buddhification flourishes and other companies earnestly emulate them, farmers will yield field boundaries, travelers will yield the road, the folk customs will be simple and honest, and livelihoods will be rich and prosperous. People will regard the area as a paradise on earth and strive to return there.</p>

<p>Affordable Obstetrics Department: All inclusive for 3角 (30 cents) per day.</p>
<p>Quit Smoking Without Pain and Continue Working as Usual.</p>
<p>Sheng Sheng Hospital is the reorganized hospital of Dr. Qu Shaohang, an obstetrics expert, and his wife, Dr. Yao Yingnai, originally known as the Qu couple's hospital. This reorganization has gained the support of Yu Yunxiu, Wang Qizhang, Xu Xiangsun, and their closest friends. Furthermore, considering that ordinary people in Shanghai suffer greatly from the difficulty of finding specialized doctors when they are sick, and even if they find one, they struggle with the financial burden, leading to delays and even the loss of lives, the hospital has set up an affordable obstetrics department in its new location on Rue Sapey in the French Concession. Pregnant women who are truly impoverished can seek a reliable introducer and go to the hospital. They will only be charged 3角 (30 cents) per day for meals, with no separate charges for delivery, injections, or medications. Moreover, the government is now strictly enforcing the ban on opium. Dr. Qu has accumulated 20 years of research on opium cessation, enabling those determined to quit to do so without pain or difficulty, and to continue working as usual. The fees are also generally affordable. The aim is to save compatriots from the sea of poison. The hospital's telephone number is 83655. Regulations are printed and available upon request.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Expansion of the Guangdong Sanatorium <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Yaocheng, an overseas Chinese, returned to China last year to visit his relatives. Passing through Shanghai, he witnessed the large number of impoverished and sick compatriots after the January 28th Incident. He generously contributed funds to establish the Guangdong Sanatorium at No. 279 Old Bazhi Road, North Sichuan Road, aiming to provide relief. He hired Mr. Ting Enshou, the elder brother of the martyr Jiao Zhongkai, as the honorary director. The sanatorium is divided into outpatient and inpatient departments. Outpatient consultations are free of charge, with only a 2角 (20 cents) registration fee. Medical doctors with prominent reputations and degrees from various foreign countries, such as Chen Daming, Wu Jishun, Chen Jiyao, Li Wenbing, and Liang Beihe, are responsible for the treatment. Therefore, within half a year of opening, the number of patients seeking treatment has been increasing daily. Recently, the sanatorium has been making every effort to expand, adding departments for affordable dentistry, obstetrics, and birth control to meet the needs of patients. To offer preferential treatment to pregnant women, delivery is particularly affordable (only 5 yuan). Regarding birth control, if doctors deem that a woman should not have children, they will implement methods researched for over 20 years by the New York Birth Control Hospital in the United States, without any pain or danger. These methods have long been recognized as perfect by people in that country.</p>

<p>All Children Have Been Picked Up by Their Families.</p>
<p>A Labor Nursery Will Soon Be Established.</p>
<p>Shiye She reports that the Children's Welfare Committee, in order to promote the welfare of children, opened the First Nursery in March of this year. They secured a building in Yu Jia Nong, Xiao Nan Men, specifically for children under the age of six. The fees were divided into two levels: 7 yuan and 8 yuan. However, due to the limited space in the building, the nursery could only accommodate 50 children. Yang Rongmao, a specialist from the Shanghai Municipal Police Yizhong Supervision Office, served as the director in charge of the nursery's affairs. Since its establishment, the nursery has been operating for over half a year, and many people from all walks of life have been eager to send their children there. As a result, the quota was quickly filled, and more than a hundred people continued to register for a waiting list. It is reported that the nursery suddenly announced its closure yesterday and had already notified the families of the children in advance to come to the nursery, hold a meeting, and return the children to their families for self-care. As of yesterday, there were still nine children remaining at the nursery who hadn’t been picked up. In two cases, the families were not in Shanghai, so it was proposed to temporarily entrust the children to reliable hospitals for care. The Children's Welfare Committee, which is in charge of the nursery, will handle the aftermath properly and is also preparing to establish a labor nursery, which is expected to be established soon. It is initially planned to accept 30 children for a small-scale trial, with Li Ting'an, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in charge of the nursery's affairs. Once funding is secured, it will be expanded.</p>

Two letters were found in his pocket, one addressed to his friend Xu Shimin, residing at No. 23 Fuxu Model Village, and the other addressed to his friend He Shouzhang, at No. 212 Jiangxi Road. The content generally stated that he was experiencing financial difficulties and unable to maintain his livelihood, so he resorted to swallowing opium and ending his life as a last resort.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 10 a.m., a traveler arrived at the New World Hotel at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tibet Road, registered for room 218, and claimed to be named Lu Minsheng, 21 years old, from Baoshan, and involved in the rice business.

<p>The American Evening Post reports that yesterday morning (the 30th), several sailors from the American ship "General Pershing," docked in the Huangpu River, boarded the American ship "Cape Horn" to seek revenge. It is said that these men were all drunk, so they were easily driven away by the sailors of the "Cape Horn." These men were interrogated by American Consular Police Executive Corgill and the Public Works Department Police and Water Police officers at 4 p.m. when the "General Pershing" weighed anchor and returned to the ship. Subsequently, Corgill ordered the men to line up on the deck and sternly warned them that if they attempted to resolve their usual disputes with violence in Shanghai, they would be severely punished. This morning (the 31st), according to Corgill, American sailors are accustomed to resolving disputes related to unions, etc., after they leave their home country. They often believe that Shanghai is a suitable place to commit acts of violence, because they believe that Shanghai has consular jurisdiction, and they can escape the law after committing a crime.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Public Concession Begins Raising Roads <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Preventing High Tide Inundation</p>
<p>The American Evening Post reports that due to the inconvenience caused by high tides in the Huangpu River during summer and autumn, when waves and muddy water rise and submerge the streets, the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council has begun a prevention plan. They will first raise Hankou Road between Sichuan Road and the Bund, which is most prone to flooding, by two chi. This work began two days ago, and they will then raise the Bund Road between Fuzhou Road and Hankou Road. This is because the section of the road has sunk due to the excessive pressure since the construction of the new Customs House. They will then gradually raise other low-lying areas. However, according to Public Works Department personnel, it is impossible to do so in many places unless the old houses are demolished and new houses with higher floors are built. To achieve a permanent solution, the outlet of the main ditch must be raised, but when it rains heavily, the water in the ditch cannot be easily discharged, and high-pressure pumps must be installed. This measure requires a huge expense, and it is impractical to install it for the flooding of a few places two or three times a year. Moreover, after new houses are rebuilt in the low-lying areas in the future, the roads will be raised accordingly, and the flooding problem will be solved naturally.</p>

<p>Approved for Operation by Minsheng Company</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the Public Concession Rickshaw Committee, previously in the name of helping rickshaw pullers, ordered rickshaw merchants to reduce the price of rickshaws. After the issue was resolved, it has recently approved the Minsheng Rickshaw Company to extract 2,000 rickshaws from the 9,990 rickshaws in the concession for operation, which may cause another major dispute. The company is named the Minsheng Rickshaw Company for the Relief of Rickshaw Pullers. In accordance with Article 16 of the Municipal Council's new regulations, it has requested the immediate extraction of 2,000 licenses for operation. The Rickshaw Committee has now approved this, and the allocation will begin on January 1, 24. The rickshaws will be built according to the Municipal Council's new rickshaw design. It has requested that charitable organizations allocate funds for construction. In addition to operating expenses, the remaining funds will be used to establish schools, provide educational materials, and operate hospitals. In addition to Shanghai, it will also be carried out in Jiangbei Yancheng, Dongtai, Taizhou, and other places one after another.</p>

<p>Calling It a Sino-Japanese Marine Products Intercourse Meeting</p>
<p>Nothing More Than the Vanguard of Economic Aggression Against China</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Fukushima Tadayoshi, the former director of the Hokkaido Prefectural Government's Shanghai Trade Research Institute, has become increasingly alienated from Chinese marine products operators (seafood merchants) since the Shanghai Incident. Now, in order to smooth relations between the two sides, rekindle old friendships, and facilitate transactions between China and Japan, he held a Sino-Japanese Marine Products Intercourse Meeting at the Weiya Restaurant on Fourth Avenue at 7 p.m. on the 30th. More than 50 people from the Chinese side and more than 20 people from the Japanese side attended, making it the largest intercourse meeting in recent years. At 7 p.m. that day, Fukushima personally hosted the event, first holding a tasting of the sea cucumbers produced in Hokkaido. The guests all praised it. At the same time, both sides exchanged opinions and coordinated methods for the development of the marine products industry in China, and the meeting did not end until 10 p.m. It is said that future transactions with Japan will become smoother.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Fraudulent Cohabitation Case <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Wang Wenxiu Bitterly Complains</p>
<p>Fu Jianqing Provides a Reliable Guarantee</p>
<p>Fu Jianqing, a native of Suzhou, also known as Zhang Huai, a resident of No. 4 Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Eight Immortals Bridge, French Concession, former director of the Second Branch of the Qingpu County Public Security Bureau, and current shareholder of Samsung Film Company, 36 years old this year, was recently sued in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court by Zhao Lingdi, also known as Wang Wenxiu, a native of Zhenjiang, 42 years old this year, the wife of the late Mr. Xi Jingui, a native of Dongting Mountain, formerly a senior scribe in the Public Works Department, residing at No. 16 Yuqing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, represented by lawyer Shen Shiyi, in accordance with Article 363 of the Criminal Code, for cohabiting under a false name, promising fraud, and taking property, requesting that the case be handled according to law, and attaching a civil suit to recover the defrauded money. The court accepted the complaint and specially opened the Criminal Court II yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Qiu Huan-ying, to summon both parties, each accompanied by their lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Zhao Lingdi, stated that her husband, Xi Jingui, had passed away eleven years ago, and she had been living in Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, determined to live a chaste life, relying on her husband's estate for a living. Last winter, she was introduced to the defendant by her neighbor, Old Woman Wang. The defendant was extremely tender and flattering, leading her to be seduced by him, and they began cohabiting in Hengmao Lane No. 30 at the end of last year. At first, she feared that he had ulterior motives and was always on guard, but his deception was extremely skillful. First, he invited her to lawyer Mao Xian's office to sign a cohabitation agreement. After that, he told her that the interest on the money she had deposited in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was too low, and it would be better to deposit it in the Huagan Trading Company, where she could get more generous interest. She believed him and handed over her seal to him. On February 24 of this year, she withdrew 1,273 yuan from her deposit in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and transferred 1,000 yuan to the Huawei Trading Company. The rest was taken by him through deception. When she questioned him, he replied that a husband and wife should not distinguish between each other and returned the deposit book to her for safekeeping. Later, he went to the north to seek employment and asked her for travel expenses, which she gave him in full. Unexpectedly, in July of this year, she fell ill and was bedridden. He said that he needed money to use and took away the deposit book, never to return. Suddenly, he filed a petition in the Civil Court to request that she be separated from the cohabitation relationship. In this situation, he knew that she had money in her bank account, and he wanted her to cohabit with him. Later, when he found out that she had no money, he wanted to break up with her. His conscience is so bad, it has caused her so much suffering, and she cannot survive. She requested the court to severely punish him according to law and force him to return the defrauded 1,000 yuan. The judge then questioned the defendant, Fu Jianqing, who stated that he had entered into a cohabitation relationship with the plaintiff on December 8 of last year, as proven by lawyers Qian and Mao. Later, he wanted to go to the north. She knew that he had a relationship with the prostitute Li Zhimei, also known as Huizhu, in Beiping, and would not allow him to go. She wanted him to issue a statement in the newspaper, severing the relationship with the prostitute Li, and at the same time, she wanted him to give her 1,000 yuan as a guarantee and give her 50 yuan a month for household expenses. He did everything. The 1,000 yuan deposited in the Huawei Trading Company was his own money, which he gave her as a guarantee, and it was not her property. On August 1 of this year, she suddenly left him and cohabited with her old lover, surnamed Liu, in Yuqing Lane. Therefore, he wanted to break up the cohabitation relationship with her. At this point, the judge asked the defendant, "You are 36 years old this year. Why did you cohabit with a 42-year-old widow? Do you love her for her looks or are you greedy for her money?" The defendant hesitated and could not answer. The court tentatively adjourned the hearing to November 19. The defendant was ordered to provide a reliable shop guarantee that he would appear whenever summoned, and if he could not provide a guarantee, he would be taken into custody.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Public Utilities Bureau's Preparations for the Pudong Water Plant <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Entrusted the Xingye Trust Company to Handle</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Stopped the Preparations</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau was ordered by the Municipal Government in May of the 19th year to prepare for the Pudong Water Plant. After actively formulating a plan, it was presented for approval. However, the required funding was more than 273,000 yuan. In addition to the 11,000 yuan allocated by the Finance Bureau for land purchase fees, the remaining 262,000 yuan was agreed upon with the Finance Bureau to allocate in installments, but the Finance Bureau found it difficult to raise the funds. Moreover, the January 28th Incident occurred, and it was forced to suspend temporarily. In the 21st year, the Municipal Government, due to the requests of the Municipal Party Department and Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, to speed up the construction of the Pudong Water Plant, ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to submit a reply, requesting that the Finance Bureau be ordered to quickly allocate the funds for implementation according to the plan. However, the Finance Bureau had no funds to allocate, so it was suspended again. In the 22nd year, the Public Utilities Bureau planned to borrow funds from the Municipal Bank for implementation and submitted a report, which was reviewed by the Finance Bureau and was not approved. By the beginning of this year, the Public Utilities Bureau, because the demand for tap water from the citizens of Pudong was becoming more urgent, requested that the mayor invite gentlemen and merchants from the city to discuss implementation methods at the Bankers' Association and designated Lin Kanghou, Yao Mulian, Gui Yanfang, Pan Zhiwen, Chen Zixin, Zhang Xiaoliang, and Cai, the director of the Finance Bureau, and Xu, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, as eight preparatory committee members. The Public Utilities Bureau convened a meeting of the preparatory committee members on March 15, and it was decided that the project would be jointly operated by the government and merchants. Merchant shares could raise 120,000 yuan, and government shares would be 80,000 yuan (including the assessed value of the land already purchased and allocated as the site for 30,000 yuan). The total amount of funds actually available was 170,000 yuan, which was still approximately 100,000 yuan short of the original difference of 262,000 yuan. The Public Utilities Bureau then negotiated with the Inland Tap Water Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and China Merchants Electric Company, etc., and they agreed to jointly contribute, with the reward money from the Inland Tap Water Company being used as collateral, to be amortized over five years starting from the 24th year. This plan was approved in principle by the Municipal Government upon submission by the Public Utilities Bureau. However, the Finance Bureau believed that the aforementioned amortization method would hinder the budget, so it was not established. Recently, the Public Utilities Bureau, in view of its responsibilities, believed that the establishment of the water plant could not be delayed any longer. After several deliberations, it found another way to raise funds, which would not interfere with the city's annual budget at all. It negotiated with Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang, a member of the preparatory committee, and decided to first advance the cost of starting construction and construct all the preparatory contracts and regulations for the water plant. The drawings and specifications of the relevant projects were sorted out and drafted, and a report was submitted to the Municipal Government for inspection and approval on October 18. The next day, it was ordered that the water plant be handled by the Xingye Trust Company. The Public Utilities Bureau replied that the funds for preparing the water plant were available and were already being actively implemented, so there was no need to entrust it to the Xingye Trust Company. On October 24, it convened a meeting of the preparatory committee to discuss matters relating to the implementation and the relevant regulations. At that time, all the committee members believed that the preparatory procedures for the water plant had been completed and unanimously decided that construction should be started immediately to ensure that the entire plant project would be completed and producing water by April next spring, supplying the citizens of Pudong. A report was made to the mayor, requesting that a meeting be convened as soon as possible to raise shares and formally establish the company. The matter was immediately handled according to the discussion, and the groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for 3 p.m. on November 8. The water pipes, materials, water meters, Xiangpu motors, and contracting matters to be used in the water plant were also decided to be advertised for bids on October 31. At that time, the Public Utilities Bureau received a letter from the Secretariat of the Municipal Government transmitting the mayor's instructions that the water plant had been handed over to the Xingye Trust Company for handling, and the preparatory committee members should be informed immediately. In addition to notifying them as directed, all the completed preparations and construction of the water plant were immediately suspended.</p>

<p>Over one hundred yuan was found on their person</p>
<p>They specialized in picking customers' wallets</p>
<p>At 10:40 PM the night before, Officer Zhao Ziling of the Fuan Company Amusement Park on Dongmen Road in the Nanshi district, received a report. He noticed three children in the park with a large amount of cash. Judging their appearance, they did not seem to be from well-to-do families. The officer detained the children for questioning, but they were evasive. The officer searched the three children. A boy named Shen Yunde (15 years old, from Sanbei, residing at No. 4, Lane 20, Xige Yu Alley, Xiaonanmen), was found with sixty yuan in cash and a small knife. Another boy, Zhang Yinsheng (13 years old, from Songjiang, residing at No. 24, Donggou Yu Alley), was found with over thirty yuan in cash. Wang Liangen (15 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 1, Donggou Yu Alley), was found with over ten yuan. A total of one hundred yuan in cash and three yuan in silver were confiscated. Upon interrogation, it was revealed that the money came from picking customers' wallets. They were immediately taken to the station for further investigation. Chief Liu interrogated the three children, Shen, Zhang, and Wang, who confessed that all the cash was obtained by picking wallets, but the wallets had already been thrown into the Huangpu River. They confessed without denial to the joint crime of stealing other people's money. They were sentenced to be handed over to the bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Cow Bone Factory Chimney Attacked Case <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Er Yu Cow Bone Factory is operated by Japanese and located in Panjiawan, Zhabei, for nearly eight or nine years. The business is quite prosperous, but the internal equipment is very simple. The factory is surrounded by wasteland, where a group of Jiangbei poor people have built sheds and live there, no less than three hundred households. The day before (30th), at around 3:00 PM, sparks suddenly came out of the factory's iron chimney and fell on the thatched house built by Dai Hongxiang, a poor man from Jiangbei. This caused a fire to start immediately. Fortunately, it was daytime, so it was discovered and quickly extinguished, preventing a disaster. However, a group of poor people believed that the factory's chimney was too low, causing sparks to often fall on the thatched houses, leading to fires. They gathered in a corner, whispering privately. Before long, more and more people gathered, and the noise grew louder. They all wanted to make trouble for the factory. Some young troublemakers, without asking for any reason, broke the iron wire that held the chimney to the outside of the factory. But the chimney was old and worn out. Once it was pulled, it fell down along with the iron wire. The cement bricks below were also pulled down, destroying a corner of the factory's fence. At that time, the security team near the factory received the news and rushed to the scene, fearing a major disaster. They quickly notified the Tanziawan Police Station of the Xinzha Branch. Chief Li Qingjie of the station dispatched officers to suppress the situation. Because Dai Hongxiang and others still refused to be restrained, Dai, Zheng, Sun, and Jiang were all arrested, taken to the Xinzha Branch, and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. A team was sent to investigate the truth. The factory owner also reported to the Japanese Consulate, which sent personnel yesterday to investigate with the Xinzha Branch District staff. It is said that the matter will be resolved soon.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Still a Virgin After Three Years of Marriage <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Wife has no love and unwilling to be a burden</p>
<p>Court reconciles, both willing to divorce</p>
<p>Liu Rongdi, a Fujianese in his late 50s, residing at No. 28, Houjia House, Haige Road, Shanghai West, married Ms. Lu and has one son and two daughters. The eldest daughter, named Aizhen (currently 21 years old), is slender and beautiful. On the eighth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar in the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), Chen Bingzhang, a local, introduced her to Cheng Jingxuan (26 years old), who lives at No. 3, Xiajiaqiao, Fahua East Town in this city, and works as a street vendor in the Hengxing Sock Factory near Jiumu Land on Minguo Road in the Nanshi district. After the marriage, the husband suffered from a hidden illness that could not be cured. Therefore, although they were husband and wife in name, they had no marital love. For three years, they shared the same bed but had different dreams. Not only did their relationship worsen day by day, but Aizhen was also repeatedly abused by Jingxuan, who hid Aizhen's clothing and other items. Aizhen was hurt by the emptiness of her marriage and sighed at the lack of love between husband and wife. On September 29 of this year, Aizhen hired lawyer Mao Yun to file a lawsuit with the local court, requesting a hearing and permission for a divorce. She also requested the court to order the defendant to return the cost of meals she had paid, totaling thirty-one months, amounting to 248 yuan, as well as clothing and other items, to secure her livelihood and save her life. The court mediation office held repeated hearings, but failed to reach a settlement, so she formally filed a lawsuit with the court. On October 23, the court sent a forensic doctor to examine Aizhen, and the result confirmed that she was still a virgin. It is now known that the case was reopened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM when the judge summoned both parties to court for questioning. The judge advised both parties to reconcile and granted the divorce. The plaintiff voluntarily abandoned all other claims.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Manager of China Industrial Bank Lu Mengxiang Arrested <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Lu appointed manager after Qin Baoyuan fled</p>
<p>Promissory notes issued are never paid in cash</p>
<p>Will be tried together with Lu Xihou case</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank went bankrupt, and the managing director Lu Xihou was investigated by the police and found that the savings deposits absorbed by the bank were obtained by Lu through improper business methods. A public prosecution for crimes such as fraud and embezzlement has been filed against Lu, and the First Special District Court has detained him for interrogation. Details were recorded in the previous report. It is now known that before the bank went bankrupt, its manager, Qin Baoyuan, fled with money on September 24. At that time, Lu Xihou believed that the position of manager could not be left vacant. He immediately promoted the bank's deputy manager, Lu Mengxiang, from Hangzhou, to the position so that he could be responsible to the outside world and maintain the bank's operations. However, after Lu took office, his attitude was the same as Qin Baoyuan, and his actions were also similar to Qin Baoyuan. Qin Baoyuan used to be directed by Lu Xihou, and for all payments that had to be made, he issued the bank's promissory notes, which were not honored when they were due. Lu Mengxiang was able to follow suit, also under the direction of Lu Xihou, and used promissory notes to stall. For example, on September 9, the Shen Bao newspaper had money deposited in the bank and issued a check for 1,150 yuan, which was handed over to the China-South Bank for collection. However, Lu Mengxiang, because there was no cash in the bank, and there was no reason to refuse payment, deliberately picked on it, deliberately provoking an argument with the person withdrawing the money, delaying the time. This trick was successful. The person withdrawing the money negotiated until 4:00 PM, and Lu Mengxiang finally agreed to pay the money, but said that it was past the prescribed business hours and could not be cashed. He then issued a promissory note for 1,150 yuan, stating that it was due on October 11. The person withdrawing the money had to take it back. On October 11, the bank suddenly went bankrupt, and the money was never recovered. Recently, the First Special District Court decided that anyone who wanted to sue the person in charge of the bank should report it to the police station so that it could be handled together. People holding the bank's dishonored notes or who were otherwise deceived reported to the General Police Station. The Shen Bao newspaper also sent this useless promissory note to the police station, asking them to investigate. It was determined that Lu Mengxiang was the manager when the note was issued, and he should be held jointly responsible with Lu Xihou for the deception. Xihou had already been detained for fraud. Mengxiang was arrested by the police at his home at No. 5, Xiaoshadu Road, the day before. He was taken to the First Special Court yesterday morning and interrogated by Judge Qian. After the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, presented the case, he said that the defendant, Lu Mengxiang, had confessed to the police that he had signed the promissory note under the instigation of Lu Xihou. He requested that the case be postponed and tried together in the future. The defendant confessed that although he was appointed manager by Lu Xihou, Lu was still in charge of the manager position in reality. The defendant described the reasons for the dishonor of the 1,150 yuan promissory note and the procedures for issuing the note. Judge Qian said that his confession was quite different from what he had said when he testified in court when Lu Xihou was interrogated the other day. He then ordered him to confess truthfully and not to prevaricate. At that time, Wu Kejia, an employee of the Shanghai Bank, was also in court on business. Judge Qian wanted to investigate the situation of the promissory note and immediately called Wu to the case, ordering him to describe the procedures for issuing promissory notes by the bank so that it could be used as a reference. According to Wu's testimony, the procedures for issuing promissory notes depend on the size of the bank. For example, at the Shanghai Bank, it is not necessary for the managing director to know about the issuance of promissory notes. If the organization is smaller, the managing director is often stationed in the bank and can certainly know. Judge Qian then instructed the defendant Lu Mengxiang to pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan and postpone the trial to be combined with the Lu Xihou case.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Accomplice in the Killing Case at Xihe Yarn Factory Surrenders and Confesses <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Main culprit Bao La Xin escapes without a trace</p>
<p>The doorkeeper of the Xihe Yarn Factory at No. 80, Robert Road, Shanghai West, Yin Bu Fadaxin, was slashed in the arm at 0:30 AM the day before due to a disagreement over lending money at high interest rates. The murderer escaped and has not been caught. The injured person was sent to Tongji Hospital for treatment by the police in a patrol car. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that at around 6:00 AM yesterday, another doorkeeper of the factory, Yin Bu Kaierxin, suddenly went to the Gordon Road Police Station in the Public Concession and stated that the main culprit in the murder case was another Yin Bu, Bao La Xin. Because Bao had a deep grudge against Fadaxin, he invited Kai Yangxin to get drunk, and at midnight, he held a kitchen knife and secretly assassinated him for revenge. He directly admitted that he was holding an iron bar at the time, and confessed without reservation to being an accomplice. After the police took his confession, they immediately arrested Kaierxin and sent him to the British Concession for trial this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Counterfeit Match Vouchers <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Each thousand can be exchanged for seven yuan</p>
<p>Discovered early by tobacco company</p>
<p>Four people have been arrested so far</p>
<p>Recently, in order to compete for business, various tobacco companies in this city have been including gift vouchers in the boxes of cigarettes to attract customers. The Company Brand cigarettes issued by the Ruilun Tobacco Company on Kaifeng Road also include exchange vouchers, totaling more than 10 million. The most common is the match voucher. If you hold one voucher, you can exchange it for a box of matches at a nearby cigarette paper store. In order to take care of the cigarette paper stores, a flexible method was also established. If you accumulate 1,000 match vouchers, you can exchange them for seven yuan in cash from the company. This has been going on for several months since the issuance. Recently, the company suddenly discovered that someone outside was counterfeiting match vouchers and fraudulently claiming money from the company. It then notified employees to pay attention to the inspection. If they encountered the above situation, they would immediately detain them for investigation. The day before yesterday at around 3:00 PM, Zhang Zhilin from Zhenjiang brought 1,100 Company Brand match vouchers to Ruilun to exchange for cash. It was discovered that the vouchers were counterfeit. The Huishi Police Station was immediately notified, and detectives Ji Xiuquan and Giberson were dispatched to bring Zhang and the counterfeit vouchers to the police station. According to Zhang, the vouchers were given to him by Mi Guoxiang, who resides at No. 383, Huishan Road. After obtaining this information, the detectives went to the address to arrest Mi, but he had already fled. Only Mi's accomplice, Shi Pengcheng from Ningbo, was arrested. According to Shi, he used to be a printing broker. The vouchers were actually commissioned by Mi to be printed at the Wenhua Printing Factory at No. 120, Lane 914, Tangshan Road, totaling 120,000 vouchers. At that time, Mi took out 60 yuan for the printing fee, but he did not know the intention. The detectives then went to the Wenhua Printing Factory and arrested the owner, Wei Wenzheng, and brought him back to the police station. Since Wei did not know about the counterfeit vouchers beforehand, Wei was released, and Zhang and Shi were detained. Not long after, the Ruilun Tobacco Company brought Chen Shunrong from Ningbo and a 14-year-old Ningbo child, Jin Yuan, who held 2,000 vouchers and 2,600 vouchers respectively, all of which were counterfeit. The police station was notified and dispatched detectives to arrest them and detain them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, there were many accomplices in this case, and the police are currently investigating. Therefore, he requested that Zhang, Shi, Tong, and Chen be detained first. He then presented the counterfeit vouchers to the court. According to Wang Xingtang, the manager of the Ruilun Company, the vouchers were confirmed to be counterfeit. When Zhang Zhilin was interrogated, he confessed that the vouchers were given to him by Mi Guoxiang to exchange for money from the company. He did not know they were counterfeit, so he had already paid Mi 6.5 yuan in advance. Shi Pengcheng also said that the vouchers were commissioned by Mi to be printed at the printing factory. Tong Jin Yuan said that he was an apprentice at the Xinchangtai Cigarette Paper Store on Xinmin Road, Zhabei. The vouchers were given to him by his master's wife to exchange for cash. Rong confessed that he lived on Wuzhou Road, but the vouchers were given to him by Ah Tang, a partner at the Rongshengchang Cigarette Paper Store opposite his residence, through Wu, and he did not know they were counterfeit. After Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions, he ordered Zhang and the other three to be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. Dai Chunfeng, a member of the Shanghai French Municipal Council, was formerly a senior employee of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology. He was relied upon by the authorities for more than ten years. He retired due to illness. Mr. Dai, in the midst of his busy official duties, never abandoned his ambition to practice calligraphy. For nearly twenty years, people knew that he was meticulous in his work and enthusiastic about public welfare, but they did not know that he was an expert in epigraphy. He did not easily show his work to others, so only his closest friends could see it. In 1930, his calligraphy was sent to Belgium and won a gold medal after international judging. This year, at the American Exposition, he sent nearly 40 styles of Jinshi calligraphy from the Qin and Han dynasties, which were displayed by the association to promote culture and show the evolution of Chinese characters throughout the ages, and to attract the attention of expatriates. It is said that the works in the United States have already been snapped up by the audience. Mr. Dai can be said to be highly valued and has opened a new record in the contemporary art world.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Regarding today's (31st) issue of your esteemed newspaper, in the "Local News" section, the article "The Rising Trend of Water Diversion Expands, Shipping Companies Decide to Suspend Navigation," the last paragraph of the National News Agency's draft mentions a "Navigation Bureau meeting," which is not in accordance with the facts. The management of water diversion affairs is under the jurisdiction of the Water Diversion Management Committee, and our bureau does not intervene. The statement that a meeting was convened yesterday to discuss countermeasures is likely a misreporting of the Navigation Association's meeting by that agency. We request that you correct this immediately to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world.

<h3 id="e200">The Motivation Behind Jiangsu Province's Conscription of Labor for the Preliminary Project of Dredging and Diverting the Huai River into the Sea <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Guofu</p>
<p>For nearly a century, the counties in the Huai River basin of this province have suffered immense losses in lives and property due to repeated floods. Although there are no precise statistics for verification, the severity of the harm is well-known to those who have grown up in this land and are familiar with the history of the Huai River basin. Official and private records also detail it extensively. Without discussing the distant past, recently, in 1931, the Huai River swelled violently, causing more than forty breaches in the eastern and western embankments of the Grand Canal. Over ten counties in the Lixiahe region were completely submerged in floodwaters. Considering only the losses in crop yields and property, it already amounted to tens of millions of yuan, not to mention the sacrifices of human and animal lives, and homes. Because of the inadequacy of human efforts, the people of several dozen counties north of the Yangtze River tremble in fear at the slightest sign of a Huai River surge, running around in panicked sweat, yet remain helpless. They can only hope to escape with their lives by some stroke of luck. Is this not an utterly lamentable situation?</p>
<p>During the late Qing dynasty, Ding Xian of Huai'an first proposed the idea of dredging the Huai River. Later, Zhang Jian of Nantong further elaborated on this idea, attracting the keen attention of concerned individuals. Unfortunately, disputes over the route to the sea or the Yangtze River remained unresolved. Coupled with frequent political instability and significant financial challenges, various factors created obstacles, and it could not be implemented. However, the importance of the Huai River dredging project and the urgency of public demand became increasingly evident. Since 1929, the central government has established the Huai River Dredging Commission specifically for this purpose, with leaders of the party and the nation serving as its heads. The importance attached to the Huai River dredging project is evident. After several years of research and investigation, taking into account the proposals of predecessors, widely soliciting public opinion, and further verifying with on-site surveys, the grand plan of diverting water separately into the Yangtze and the sea was finalized. In terms of engineering plans, it can be said that a stage has been reached. As long as the funding is secured, large-scale construction will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Although the Huai River dredging project concerns the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the three provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui are located upstream. Without the dredging of the Huai River, the discharge of water will only be slightly less smooth. This province, however, is situated at the tail end of the Huai River, receiving water from all three provinces. With no outlet for the water, the fertile land of several dozen counties in the Huai River basin is forced to serve as a collection point for the floodwaters of the upstream three provinces. The extent of the harm is beyond description. The Huai River Dredging Commission is planning for the long term, and its overall planning must be far-reaching. Before the entire budget is secured, starting large-scale construction will inevitably take time. However, the livelihood issues of the counties north of the Yangtze River in this province are of utmost importance and cannot be delayed any longer. This is the first reason why we must first undertake the preliminary project of diverting the river into the sea to eliminate the scourge as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This province has long been known as a region of abundant wealth in the southeast, rich in products and flourishing in commerce. However, in recent years, repeated droughts and floods have plagued the area, leading to economic hardship for industry and commerce, and the rural economy is increasingly heading towards bankruptcy. Bandits are lurking, and refugees are everywhere. The main reason for this is the neglect of water conservancy, and the failure to dredge the Huai River north of the Yangtze River is the crux of the problem. If we do not plan for this now, what endless troubles will there be in the future? When I first arrived in Jiangsu last year, I was deeply concerned and believed that completing the dredging of the Huai River was a crucial task for rescuing the people's livelihood north of the Yangtze River. At the same time, because the Huai River dredging project requires tens of millions of yuan, which the current financial resources of this province cannot afford, I proposed the idea of conscripting labor to carry out the preliminary project of diverting the river into the sea. Although there is an ancient saying about using the strength of the people, there was still some doubt whether the project was too large to be carried out smoothly. This spring, we slightly repaired and dredged the Liutang River, relying on the labor of the people in the counties along the river, and the gentry worked together to assist, and it was completed as scheduled. It was then that I realized that the people in the Huai River basin are indeed capable of great things. This is the second reason why we resolutely adopted the method of conscripting labor to carry out the preliminary project of dredging and diverting the Huai River into the sea.</p>
<p>Some may argue that the Huai River dredging project is a matter of national importance, and the central government must bear this heavy responsibility. The project is difficult and expensive, and only the central government has the resources to complete it. In a time when the finances of this province are already stretched, we should not force the people to exert their strength and do it piecemeal. I disagree. The Huai River dredging project takes the relief of the people's livelihood as a prerequisite. The responsibility belongs to the central government, but the benefits remain with the local area. Although the central government feels that it is not easy to raise a large sum of money due to the serious national crisis, it has also used the Boxer Indemnity funds to start preliminary projects such as the Zhangfu River. The completion of the Huaiyin Shaobo Liujian three sluices is under construction, the preparation of the Sanheba Dam project, and the repair of the west embankment of the Grand Canal, etc. The cost of these projects is thousands and millions of yuan. If we further supplement what the central government cannot reach with the local people's strength and financial resources of this province and proceed jointly, it will be of a cooperative nature with the central government, and it will still be a self-rescue plan for this province. With internal and external support, and joint efforts, the results will be easily seen, and success can be expected.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have even greater hopes. The Huai River dredging project concerns four provinces. This province is located downstream. Although the three upstream provinces do not have the intention of using their neighbors as a drain, this province has suffered repeated disasters and suffered greater pain because it receives water from the three provinces. Now, this province, after repeated disasters and financial difficulties, has already borne the burden of pain and taken the initiative to carry out the preliminary project of dredging and diverting the Huai River into the sea. I especially hope that the three upstream provinces will do their best to assist, and the central government will lead the organization to lead, so that the great project can be completed as soon as possible. I cannot help but wait and see!</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Process of Preparing for the Preliminary Project of Dredging and Diverting the Huai River into the Sea <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Baixian</p>
<p>The Huai River originally flowed into the sea independently, and was listed as one of the "Four Rivers." Since the time of Yu the Great's flood control, it has remained unchanged for more than three thousand years. From the Five Dynasties and Northern Song onwards, the Yellow River broke its banks and caused problems for the Huai River. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Jia Lu blocked the breaches, and Liu Daxia built the Taihang Dike. The Huai River was thus taken over by the Yellow River, stopping at every gate, taking Hongze and Gaobao Lakes as temporary lodgings, and the Eastern Sluice Dams for self-transportation into the Yangtze River and the sea as its final resting place. Thus, between Huai'an and Yangzhou, the disasters of the Huai River have occurred repeatedly, and have not ended to this day. In the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855), the Yellow River broke at Tongwaxiang and moved north, returning to the old course of Qiancheng. The proposal to dredge the Huai River arose accordingly. Mr. Ding Xipu of Shanyang was the first to advocate for it, and knowledgeable individuals responded in unison. During the reigns of Guangxu and Xuantong, Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong advocated even more vigorously. By the time of the Republic of China, the Jianghuai Water Conservancy Survey Bureau was established, later renamed the Huai River Dredging Survey Office. The achievements from the survey from the first year of the Republic of China (1912) to the fifteenth year (1926) were most notable. The late Premier's "National Construction Plan" further recognized the dredging of the Huai River as an urgent matter. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, adhering to the legacy, resolved to implement dredging based on the survey results of the past eighteen years. The Central Government immediately established the Huai River Dredging Commission, aiming to complete the project within a specified period to eliminate the disaster of the Huai River and secure the people's livelihood. Looking back over the past seventy or eighty years, the Chinese people have exhausted their efforts to realize the dredging of the Huai River, and their diligence can be said to be thorough. However, they have long been troubled by the cost of labor, resulting in empty words without any benefit. Now, I, Baixian, following Chairman Chen, have been appointed to manage the construction of Jiangsu Province, and after taking office, I was ordered to prepare for the conscription of labor to carry out the preliminary project of diverting the Huai River into the sea. I am secretly pleased that the most desired thing of the Chinese people can be realized. Now that the preparations have been completed and the great project will begin immediately, I will describe the preparation process as a memorial to the beginning of the project.</p>
<p>The Huai River dredging work has been painstakingly carried out by the Huai River Dredging Commission for several years, considering the opinions of all parties, surveying, researching, and finally determining the principle of separating the Yangtze River and the sea. The waterway into the sea runs from the Zhangfu River through the abandoned Yellow River to the Taozikou to enter the sea. The original plan was for a bottom width of 120 meters and a dike distance of 350 meters, requiring a cost of more than 34 million yuan. The work is large and expensive, and it is definitely not something that the provincial government's finances can afford. Therefore, last year, we first conscripted labor to dredge the Liutang River as a preparation and experiment for the Huai River dredging project. We relied on the enthusiastic conscription of the people and the enthusiastic assistance of the gentry, and the result was exceptionally satisfactory. It was then that we became certain that the elders and brothers of the Huai River basin understood the principles and were able to bravely do what was just and not complain when it came to matters of vital interest; this is why the decision was made to conscript labor to carry out the Huai River into the sea project.</p>
<p>In May of this year, the General Office had a two-year plan for the first phase of the Huai River into the sea project. The river line runs from the Zhangfu River along the abandoned Yellow River channel to the Qitao, leaving the abandoned Yellow River and entering the sea from the Taozikou. The total length is about 172 kilometers, and the distance between the two dikes is 350 meters. Except for the bottom width of the river, which is reduced from 120 meters to 35 meters, everything else is handled in accordance with the original plan of the Huai River Commission. It is estimated that more than 66.6 million cubic meters of earth need to be excavated and more than 5 million cubic meters of earth need to be used for building dikes, all of which will be done by conscripting labor. In order to consider the work, food expenses will still be given appropriately according to the square, which is estimated to cost more than 6.8 million yuan. As for the two movable dams at Yangzhuang and Zhoumen, which require a cost of 1.06 million yuan, they will still be undertaken by the Huai River Commission in order to achieve division of labor and cooperation, and to have both storage and discharge.</p>
<p>In June of this year, after the Liutang River project was completed, the Huai River Dredging Commission was immediately consulted to order the relevant counties to continue to open up the Huai River into the sea waterway by conscripting labor. The original consultation stated briefly:</p>
<p>The route for opening up the waterway into the sea has recently been agreed upon by the Chief Engineer of the Association and Director Shen of the Construction Department of your province, and the method of conscripting labor to dredge the Liutang River will be adopted. The relevant counties will be ordered to continue to open up the waterway from Yangzhuang, Huaiyin, through the abandoned Yellow River Qitao to the Taozikou by conscripting labor. Before the start of construction, a construction survey team should be organized to nail down the river line and survey the earthworks in detail as a standard for allocating labor to each county. The operating expenses of this survey team and all the necessary equipment for the staff will be prepared by this Association. The dredging project, the dike construction project, and other necessary equipment related to the project should be handled by your province by conscripting labor to comply with cooperation and reduce Shen disaster. The case was then submitted to the 669th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, and the resolution in principle was passed. After consulting the Huai River Commission, the conscription matters will be prepared by this province, and the survey matters will be implemented quickly to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>In early July of this year, the Huai River Commission was approved to consult that the sea waterway survey team would depart immediately, and it was requested to order the protection of the counties under its jurisdiction. The counties along the river were ordered to comply properly, and the public security department was jointly ordered to order the military police in the counties along the river to listen to the survey team's consultation in order to be thorough.</p>
<p>In August of this year, this province presented to the central government for approval the issuance of 20 million yuan of water conservancy construction bonds for the purpose of preparing for the Huai River into the sea, opening up new canals, and handling drought relief and other projects. 6 million yuan was allocated to the Huai River into the sea project by conscripting labor. The most difficult problem to solve in the Huai River dredging project, the funding problem, was also solved satisfactorily at this point.</p>
<p>In September of this year, the survey was about to be completed, and the dredging project urgently needed to be implemented. Therefore, the draft organizational regulations for the Jiangsu Province Huai River into the Sea Engineering Office and the section engineering offices were prepared. In order to be extra cautious, the provincial government was asked to appoint the chief engineer of the Huai River Commission as a consulting engineer to guide the handling at any time. The case was submitted to the 691st meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. The resolution was to handle the appointment letter and to amend and approve the regulations. It was also resolved to appoint Xu Xinwu as the Director of the Jiangsu Province Huai River into the Sea Engineering Office, Chen Hefu as the Deputy Director, and Ge Hanlou as the Chief Engineer. The letters of appointment were issued separately by the Provincial Government. The Engineering Office was established in Huaiyin on October 1, and the construction was scheduled to begin on time. On one side, a telegram was sent to the four counties of Huaiyin, Huai'an, Lianshui, and Funing to repair and level the south embankment of the abandoned Yellow River, so that cars could travel on it to facilitate the construction work. The deadline was before October 10. The counties north of the Yangtze River were ordered to investigate and report the quantity and price of reed mats produced, so that they could be purchased for building sheds to live in. At the same time, the Provincial Government ordered the administrative inspector commissioners of the Huaiyin and Yancheng districts to concurrently serve as the supervisory commissioners of the Huai River into the sea project; the county magistrates of the twelve counties of Huaiyin, Huai'an, Lianshui, Funing, Siyang, Yangyan, Yancheng, Baoying, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Dongtai, Jiangdu, and Taixian concurrently served as the conscription commissioners of the Engineering Office. The above-mentioned counties were ordered to investigate and report the number of conscripted laborers within a limited time, and to wait for allocation and distribution.</p>
<p>On October 2, the Huai River into the Sea Engineering Office and the 24-month regular expenses budget for the section engineering offices were jointly prepared with the Finance Department and submitted to the 693rd meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for amendment and approval. On October 8 and 16, the county magistrates of the twelve counties of Huaiyin and others were convened to the province twice, together with the Department of Civil Affairs, to discuss the progress of the conscription of laborers and to formulate the management methods for the laborers. Regulations on rewards and punishments for conscripted laborers and a proclamation to the people were issued. At that time, the Engineering Office had been established as scheduled on October 1 and started work. All the original engineering plans were re-examined by the Engineering Office, which considered that the soil removal distance was too far according to the standard cross-section, and it was impossible to do. It was proposed to reduce the original plan of 350 meters between the two dikes to 230 meters, and the average soil removal distance was 122 meters, which was 32% shorter than the original plan, so that the number of workers and the date could meet the regulations, and there would be no impact on the amount of discharge. The consultation was transferred to the Steering Committee for approval. Thus, the Huai River into the sea project, which was initiated 70 or 80 years ago, was decided to be implemented on November 1, 1934, after half a year of preparation.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is something that Baixian cannot help but say: the Huai River into the sea project requires a total cost of 34 million yuan according to the original plan of the Huai River Commission, that is, the preliminary project plan this time, if it is not done by conscripting labor, it will also require 16 million yuan. Now, we resolutely use 6 million yuan to carry out a 16 million yuan project. This is because the disasters of the Huai River are urgent and cannot be delayed or hesitated; and the satisfactory results of the Liutang River project have also encouraged and promoted it. The value of the work done on the Liutang River is estimated at 1 million yuan. The provincial government raised 360,000 yuan, which only accounts for 13% of the total cost; the remaining 50% is the labor of the laborers; and 20% is the merit of the gentry's assistance. Now, the 60,000 yuan raised by the provincial government for the Huai River project is approaching 30% of the originally planned 16 million yuan; the remaining 60-70% is expected to be borne by the local elders and brothers in order to eradicate the old and hidden troubles of many years and seek a permanent and lasting peace, and they will be able to bear the pain, struggle, and work together with the government in unity; then, the completion of the project in two years as scheduled can be guaranteed. In the future, when the project is completed, the Huai and Hai Rivers will be connected, with high banks and deep channels, dispersing the turbidity and raising the clarity, and after ten or dozens of years, they will gradually return to their original state. The effect should surpass what was expected in the preliminary project: and the commencement of this preliminary project is enough to move people to remember and increase the value of commemoration!</p>
<p>Plans</p>
<h3 id="e202">Original Plan for the Two-Year Project of Jiangsu Province's Labor Conscription for Opening and Dredging the Huai River into the Sea <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Since its establishment in the 18th year of the Republic of China, the Huai River Conservancy Commission has, after several surveys and designs, and discussions of gains and losses, finally decided to adopt the principle of diverting the Huai River into both the Yangtze River and the sea. The outline of the entire Huai River management plan and the plan for the waterway into the sea have been successively announced. The final decision for the waterway into the sea was to pass through the Zhangfu River, through the abandoned Yellow River, to the Taizikou to enter the sea, with a total length of approximately 172 kilometers. The river bottom width is 120 meters. The distance between the two embankments is 350 meters. The total cost required is 34,426,900 yuan. Subsequently, due to the large cost and difficulty in raising funds, a phased implementation plan was developed. The first phase of the project, except that the river bottom width was reduced from 120 meters to 35 meters, everything else remained unchanged from the original plan. However, it still required 16 million yuan in construction funds. Ultimately, due to the large scale of the project and the large amount of funds required, it was never realized.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the Yellow River's northward diversion, the Huai River has never returned to its original course. Our Jiangsu Province is located at the tail end of the Huai River, suffering from disasters in almost nine out of ten years. The people are struggling to survive. Therefore, local people in Jiangsu Province deeply hope that this waterway into the sea will be completed as soon as possible to alleviate the pain of the sinking of Jiangbei. The Huai River Conservancy Commission is currently actively carrying out the initial management of the Central Canal and the Li Canal project, and the funds required for the sea entry project are very large. It is deeply felt that raising funds is difficult. In order to promote the early realization of the Huai River into the sea project, the provincial government of this province intends to cooperate with the Huai River Conservancy Commission and, with reference to the method of labor conscription for repairing and dredging the Liutang River, to achieve rapid completion. At the same time, considering the difficulty of the life of the laborers, it is still planned to raise a large amount of money from the province to provide food according to the location, so as to maintain the livelihood of the laborers and enable them to work with peace of mind and jointly accomplish this great undertaking.</p>
<p>(II) Project Overview</p>
<p>The original route planned by the Huai River Conservancy Commission is extremely perfect. Taking the straightening of the bend between Yinjia Ferry and Jiaolingji as an example, not only is the amount of earthwork reduced, but the drainage is also increased due to the steeper slope. The effect is very obvious, but near the straightened bend, the terrain is low-lying and the embankment is too high. Ramming work cannot be handled by labor conscription. If a slight carelessness, the disaster of embankment collapse will be repeated. Therefore, it is necessary to make appropriate changes, still following the old channel of the abandoned Yellow River. Below Qitao, the original plan of the Huai River Conservancy Commission is still followed, and the river directly enters the sea from Taizikou to save labor costs.</p>
<p>The cross-section of this plan still follows the Huai River Conservancy Commission's plan. A waterway with a bottom width of 35 meters is built in the abandoned Yellow River channel according to the preliminary project of dredging the Zhangfu River to discharge floodwaters. When the water level of Hongze Lake is 15 meters, the river water depth is 7.5 meters. The top of the two embankments is 1.5 meters above the flood level, and the embankment distance is 350 meters. One movable dam each is built at Yangzhuang and Zhoumen. The water level difference between Hongze Lake and Yangzhuang is 1.4 meters. The head loss of Yangzhuang movable dam is 0.25 meters. The water level below Yangzhuang Dam is 13.35 meters, and the sea level is 1.5 meters. The head loss of the Zhoumen movable dam is 0.25 meters. Therefore, the total drop of the water surface from the downstream of Yangzhuang Dam to the sea is 11.6 meters. This plan follows the old channel of the abandoned Yellow River. The route is slightly more circuitous, with a total length of 168.59 kilometers. Therefore, the water surface gradient is 0.0000688.</p>
<p>The flow rate is calculated using Forchheimer's formula.</p>
<p>In the formula, the riverbed roughness coefficient (n) is 0.0225. The relationship between the flow rate and the water level of Hongze Lake is as follows:</p>
<p>Hongze Lake Water Level Riverbed Width Gradient Flow Velocity Flow Rate</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that when the water level of Hongze Lake is 15 meters, the flow rate is 455 cubic meters per second. It is found that the maximum flow rate of the abandoned Yellow River in the 10th year of the Republic of China was 183 cubic meters per second. At that time, the water level of Yangzhuang was 15.19 meters. The maximum flow rate of the abandoned Yellow River in the 20th year of the Republic of China was 339 cubic meters per second. At that time, the water level of Yangzhuang was 15.82 meters. It is also found that when the water level of Yangzhuang is below 13.0 meters, the abandoned Yellow River has no outflow. Comparing this with the above table, the effect of excavation can be seen. If the Three Rivers movable dam at the mouth of Hongze Lake is completed, the normal water level of Hongze Lake will be 13.5 meters. Before a major flood occurs, the sea entry waterway can first be lowered as much as possible to partially empty the lake water in advance. Since Hongze Lake has this diversion waterway, its rise will be slowed down, and the chance of reaching the highest peak will also be reduced. Indirectly reducing the burden of Hongze Lake is also indirectly shortening the time of the flood peak. Therefore, after the completion of the Three Rivers movable dam, the effect of the sea entry waterway will be more significant. (See the plan view for the route)</p>
<p>The riverbed of the abandoned Yellow River is mostly sandy soil. After deepening, the water is sufficient, and it may be gradually expanded by hydraulic erosion, which will be more economical and efficient.</p>
<p>(III) Earthwork Estimate</p>
<p>The calculation of the earthwork in this plan is based on the actual topographic map measured by the Huaiyang Xuhai Cross-Section Survey Bureau in the 10th year of the Republic of China and the longitudinal section map of the abandoned Yellow River bed. A total of 69 cross-sections were taken. For the sake of simplicity, three points were taken from the riverbed and both banks of each cross-section, and the average excavation depth was calculated. The embankment height was also calculated by referring to the average terrain on both banks. This calculation may be slightly different from the actual situation, but the overall difference should not be too far. It can be used as a basis for estimating construction costs and allocating work sections. Once construction starts, detailed measurement and re-estimation will be carried out.</p>
<p>The total excavation earthwork for the entire river is 66,606,311 cubic meters, and the embankment earthwork is 5,036,090 cubic meters. All embankment work is built using excavated soil, and no foundation is added for the time being. (The earthwork calculation table is omitted)</p>
<p>(IV) Construction Method</p>
<p>The original plan of the Huai River Conservancy Commission was to build one movable dam each at Yangzhuang and Zhoumen. It is proposed that the Huai River Conservancy Commission will still be responsible for the construction. All excavation and embankment earthwork will be handled by the labor conscription of this province. The entire project is scheduled to be completed in two years so that it can be completed at the same time as the two-year construction plan of the Huai River Conservancy Commission.</p>
<p>The construction of the Zhoumen movable dam is entirely for controlling the water volume and raising the water level to supply irrigation water to the Funing area. Currently, the Huai River Conservancy Commission has not been able to handle shipping and irrigation east of Lixiahe for the time being. If funds are tight, the construction of the Zhoumen movable dam can be postponed. However, the Yangzhuang movable dam must be built in advance in order to control the water level of Hongze Lake and maintain the water source of the Grand Canal. Therefore, in the construction, it is planned to leave 250 meters of Yangzhuang unexcavated as the dam foundation for the construction of the movable dam and to prevent canal water from flowing in. As for the Haikou cutting beach project, it is planned to be carried out in the second year.</p>
<p>All laborers will be conscripted from the relevant counties along the Huai River. For the convenience of management, each county will form a section, and all will be accommodated in labor camps and work nearby. Before implementation, the amount of earthwork to be done should be calculated according to the number of laborers to be conscripted in each county. Then, the amount of earthwork shared over two years should be divided into work sections. The boundaries are designated, and the designated work sections are ordered to be completed by the county within two years. In this way, the laborers from each county will not be mixed up, and the responsibilities will be specific. The work location does not need to be moved, and the efficiency is also high.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the entire project is uniform and to facilitate the guidance of technical personnel, the following 13 construction methods are specified for compliance.</p>
<p>Article 1: The river line should be as straight as possible and should not be curved into sharp angles. If it is unavoidable due to the terrain, there must be a curve with a radius of at least one kilometer.</p>
<p>Article 2: The embankment line should run parallel to the river and should be oriented in a direction that is not directly exposed to local prevailing storms.</p>
<p>Article 3: The river bottom width is temporarily set at 35 meters, and the river slope is uniformly 1:2.5.</p>
<p>Article 4: The distance between the embankments on both sides is specified as 350 meters, the embankment top width is 4 meters, and the embankment slope is uniformly 1:3.</p>
<p>Article 5: All excavated river soil should be used to build the embankment body.</p>
<p>Article 6: If there is an old embankment that does not need to be repaired or there is excess excavated soil, the remaining excavated soil should be piled outside the embankment to widen the embankment foot.</p>
<p>Article 7: When repairing old embankments, in addition to removing all tree bark, grass roots, and stones from the slope, it should be cut into a stepped shape, with each step being 30 centimeters high, and interlocked with the new soil layer by layer to gradually increase the height.</p>
<p>Article 8: When building new embankments, all tree roots, grass skin, stones, and branches and leaves of all plants in the embankment foundation must be completely removed without any residue. The old soil on the surface layer must also be loosened before adding new soil.</p>
<p>Article 9: All branches and grass roots in the excavated river soil must be removed.</p>
<p>Article 10: If the excavated river soil is too poor, it can only be used to fill the core of the embankment. The embankment top slope must be covered with good soil.</p>
<p>Article 11: If there are old streams, traces of landslides, or soil holes dug due to the removal of grass roots, etc., in the new embankment foundation, they should be filled firmly.</p>
<p>Article 12: All burrow holes on the old embankment must be carefully checked and filled firmly.</p>
<p>Article 13: At ferries or roads, a road slope of 1:15 should be built. If it is a new road, it should not be at right angles to the embankment body. On the river side, it should descend in the same direction as the water flow. On the land side, it should rise in the same direction as the water flow.</p>
<p>(V) Regulations During Construction</p>
<p>The total earthwork to be excavated for the entire river is 66,606,311 cubic meters, which is scheduled to be completed in two years. Approximately 33 million cubic meters must be done each year. The embankment body is built using excavated soil, which only requires a little tidying up and does not require much labor. There are 160,000 laborers. Divided into 15 sections, construction is carried out simultaneously. The distance between the embankments on both sides is specified as 350 meters, and the earth removal distance is approximately 175 meters. If each person removes 1.5 cubic meters of soil per day, it can be completed in 140 days. Adding 70 days for rain, snow, and special accidents, the entire project can be completed in seven months.</p>
<p>The annual project is planned to be held during the period when the water is low and the agricultural teams are available. It is estimated that the engineering office will be organized on September 1 each year to start preparations. A meeting of the county heads of the relevant counties will be convened on September 10. The engineering offices of each section will be established on October 1. It is stipulated that construction must start uniformly before October 15. All preparatory matters such as construction, surveying, allocation of work sections, signing of tree logs, construction of dams, water baling, formulation of various regulations, and conscription of laborers to support work sheds must be completed before October 15. October 15 to May 31 of the following year is the period for implementation of the work. The engineering offices of each section will be closed on June 10 of the following year. The engineering office will be closed at the end of June. The number of people does not need to be sufficient at the beginning and end, so the regular expense budget can be calculated for nine months.</p>
<p>(VI) Management of Laborers</p>
<p>This time, when conscripting labor to dredge the abandoned Yellow River, the method of staffing is stipulated to be uniform for all counties. The smallest unit is a sub-team. Each sub-team has 100 people, with one sub-team leader. Ten sub-teams form a team, totaling 1,000 laborers, with one team leader. Each county has one general team leader to command them. The sub-team leaders and team leaders are concurrently held by the district and township chiefs appointed by the county government. The general team leader is concurrently held by the director of the construction bureau, the chief of the construction section, or the chief staff member of the county government. The county head of each county is the labor conscription commissioner, supervising the team leaders to be responsible for all labor conscription and management of laborers. All labor conscription methods, in addition to referring to the regulations on river dredging by labor conscription in each county promulgated by the Construction Department, the scope of their work is now stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>1. Investigate and compile the labor conscription roster</p>
<p>2. Investigate and compile the rosters of householders, able-bodied men, and commutation fees</p>
<p>3. Summon laborers</p>
<p>4. Hire laborers on behalf of others</p>
<p>5. Assign laborer teams</p>
<p>6. Lead the laborers to the work section</p>
<p>7. Supervise the laborers' attendance and work progress</p>
<p>8. Investigate and report the number of attendees each day</p>
<p>9. Handle laborer hygiene matters</p>
<p>10. Handle security matters</p>
<p>11. Handle other matters related to laborer management</p>
<p>The general team leaders, team leaders, and sub-team leaders of each county must be stationed at the work site to supervise the progress.</p>
<p>(VII) Organization of the Engineering Office</p>
<p>For the convenience of implementation of the project, it is proposed to establish a Huai River into the Sea Engineering Office. The office will have one director in charge of all matters within the office, one chief engineer, and several engineers and deputy engineers. Under the order of the director, they will be responsible for all matters within the office, and several assistant engineers will be responsible for supervising and guiding the progress of the work of each section under the guidance of the director and chief engineer. Review and investigate and compare the achievements of the work of each section, report the progress of the work of each section every week, and matters such as the distribution of tools and work sections. Several staff members, accountants, and compensators will be responsible for the translation and transcription of documents, the receipt and storage of documents, the custody and bookkeeping of construction funds, the payment of salaries to each staff member, and the preparation of budget calculations. Outside the office, section engineering offices will be set up to handle the affairs of each work section. The division of work sections this time is not limited to the county boundary, but is controlled by the number of laborers conscripted in each county. Each county's allocated work section will have one office, for a total of twelve offices. However, the amount of labor in each county varies, and the length and size of the project vary. Therefore, the organization of each office is also slightly different. For the work sections with larger projects, such as those undertaken by Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Yancheng, and Funing counties, each will have one engineer serving concurrently as the section chief. The remaining work sections with smaller projects will only have one to two deputy engineers or assistant engineers. However, one person will be designated by the director to concurrently serve as the section chief, and will be responsible for all matters within the section under the order of the director. Within the section, there will be several technical personnel depending on the complexity of the work. Under the order of the chief, they will be responsible for measuring work sections, supervising and guiding the progress of the project, and studying and statistically implementing the achievements of the project. Several staff members and consultants will be responsible for accounting, documentation, and writing matters. The general team leader of the laborers in each county should work in the section office and be directed by the section chief of each section.</p>
<p>(VIII) Budget Estimate</p>
<p>The unit price of the food allowance for each cubic meter of excavated earth is temporarily calculated at 8 cents per cubic meter. The total earthwork for two years is 66,606,311 cubic meters, requiring labor costs of 5,328,505 yuan. In addition, the Haikou cutting beach project costs 100,000 yuan. The total earthwork cost is 5,428,505 yuan.</p>
<p>The cost of dam construction and demolition is estimated at 35,000 yuan per year, and the cost of water baling is estimated at 30,000 yuan per year. All laborers will be accommodated in tents. Ten people per tent. The cost of materials for each tent is estimated at 4.5 yuan, and the annual tent construction cost is estimated at 72,000 yuan. The length of the work site is approximately 90 kilometers per year. 40 planks are used per kilometer, and each plank costs 5 yuan, for a total of 18,000 yuan. The cost of tree logs, ropes, rulers, and all other work sundries is estimated at 13,000 yuan per year. In addition, the cost of construction measurement is approximately 10,000 yuan per year. The total cost of equipment and facilities is 338,000 yuan.</p>
<p>There are 1,600 sub-team leaders. Each person receives a monthly allowance of 10 yuan. There are 160 team leaders. Each person receives a monthly allowance of 20 yuan. There are 15 general team leaders. Each person receives a monthly allowance of 40 yuan. Calculated for seven months per year, the total allowance is 138,600 yuan. The total cost for two years is 277,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The regular expenses of the engineering office and the office are budgeted for nine months per year, costing 264,855 yuan. The total cost for two years is 529,710 yuan.</p>
<p>The budget fee is calculated as 4% of the total budget amount. The total cost for two years is approximately 240,000 yuan. The total cost of all the above expenses is 6,813,415 yuan. In addition, two movable dams will be built at Yangzhuang and Zhoumen, costing approximately 1,060,000 yuan. It is proposed to request the Huai River Conservancy Commission to allocate funds for construction.</p>
<p>The annual expenses required are listed in the attached table.</p>
<p>It is found that the above plan is the original plan proposed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction in May of this year. As the project is currently being implemented, it has been slightly modified from time to time. This is hereby noted. Editor's Note</p>

<h3 id="e204">Detailed Construction Rules of the Huai River into the Sea Engineering Office <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— (Ordered by the Engineering Office)</p>
<p>(A) Plan 1. This project is scheduled to be completed in two years. At the end of the first year, the excavated river shapes of each section must be connected to each other to facilitate flow.</p>
<p>2. Before the start of construction of each section, the section engineer shall lead the engineer, supervisor, and construction worker to actually measure the river channel map according to the prescribed standard cross-section map, nail the center tree and river bottom tree, and use lime lines to mark the excavation range, the left and right slopes, and nail the slope tree to mark the embankment and soil heap boundaries. The true height of all fixed water level posts and log posts in the section should be accurately measured initially, and should be corrected at any time thereafter.</p>
<p>3. The river line should be measured and taken straight, and should not be curved into sharp angles. If it is unavoidable due to the terrain, there must be a curve with a radius of at least one kilometer. The embankment line should run parallel to the river and should be oriented in a direction that is not directly exposed to local prevailing storms.</p>
<p>4. The river bottom width is uniformly 35 meters, and the slope of the two banks is 2.5 to 1, which means that the horizontal distance is 2.5 and the vertical distance is 1. The center distance between the two embankments is 230 meters. The planned embankment top width is 4 meters, the two slopes are 3 to 1, and the embankment is expected to be 1.5 meters higher than the flood level and 9 meters higher than the river bottom. If there is a lot of soil, the embankment body should be widened outward, and the center distance should also be lengthened. When excavating 7 meters of soil, the width of the entire river center at the embankment foot should be kept above 107 meters.</p>
<p>5. The engineering personnel of each section should first examine the terrain of each section, plan the drainage method, first order the laborers to draw and excavate the drainage ditch, concentrate the rainwater, select a suitable location to install a machine to pump water, or use manual water baling. If it is possible to use the order of excavation to automatically empty the stored water, efforts should be made to avoid mechanical water pumping.</p>
<p>6. The excavation procedure of each section is assumed as shown in the following figures (figures omitted). The engineering personnel of each section should still consider the local situation and try to select and allocate resources. The standard is that the soil removal is convenient, the rainwater has a destination, and the work is not hindered, and it is convenient to collect the earthwork.</p>
<p>(B) Soil Removal 7. All excavated river soil should be used to build the embankment body and should not be discarded arbitrarily. If there are old embankments and high ridges that hinder soil transportation, they should be removed first to increase the efficiency of soil removal.</p>
<p>8. If there is too much excavated river soil and there is a surplus in building the embankment, the soil should be piled outside the embankment as much as possible to widen the embankment foot. The soil should not be piled higher than 2 meters above the specified height.</p>
<p>9. If there is not enough excavated river soil to build the embankment, soil should be taken from the embankment interior, the bank beach surface, and the embankment should be built at least 30 meters from the embankment foot. The specified height should be increased by a virtual height of 20%. The earthwork for this embankment construction should be collected according to the lower side.</p>
<p>(C) Earthwork Calculation 10. The excavation earthwork is temporarily scheduled to be collected once a week. Before the earthwork is collected, the laborers should properly keep the remaining tree logs and marks, and repair and excavate the earth pit neatly for calculation. The supervisor should strictly check the earth pit to prevent any malpractices such as edging, capping, arching the heart, arching the waist, and steep corners.</p>
<p>11. The average allowance for excavating river soil is temporarily set at 8 cents per cubic meter. Because the excavation depth changes from shallow to deep and the work efficiency is very different, the unit price of the allowance is layered as shown in the table on the left.</p>
<p>(Note) The average beach surface should be calculated by averaging the height of the beach surface and the old river bottom in the excavated part of each small section.</p>
<p>12. The supervisor should pay attention to whether the laborer's soil removal complies with the regulations. If the soil removal location does not match and the soil is discarded along the way, the laborer should be ordered to carry the soil back. Otherwise, the earthwork shall not be collected.</p>
<p>13. When the supervisor collects the earthwork, he should fill in the team name of the sub-team, the number of laborers actually working, the number of working days, the earth pit number, and the detailed dimensions, average depth, and fill in the main collection form to calculate the earthwork. The form should be submitted to the engineer or assistant engineer for review and correction, and a wage voucher should be filled out and handed over to the team leader to be signed by the section chief at the section engineering office. The form should be stored and transferred separately, and then taken to the section accounting office to fill out a formal receipt to receive the allowance and wage.</p>
<p>(D) Engineering Practice 14. When excavating river soil to a considerable depth, the laborers should make slopes with more than four slopes on both slopes for easy carrying. When building embankments and heaping soil, the soil should be laid on the embankment foot first and then the embankment foot should be formed. The soil should be poured to form the embankment foot, and the height should be increased layer by layer. No planks should be used.</p>
<p>15. When repairing old embankments, in addition to removing all tree bark, grass roots, and stones from the slope, it should be cut into a stepped shape, with each certificate being 30 meters high, and interlocked with the new soil layer by layer to gradually increase the height.</p>
<p>16. When building new embankments, all tree roots, grass skin, stones, and branches and leaves of all plants in the embankment foundation must be completely removed without any residue. The old soil on the surface layer must also be loosened before adding new soil.</p>
<p>17. All branches, grass roots, and debris in the excavated river soil must be picked up. If the soil quality is too poor, it can only be used to fill the core of the embankment. The top surface of the embankment must be covered with good soil.</p>
<p>18. If there are old streams or traces of landslides in the new embankment foundation, soil holes where tree roots have been removed, and burrow holes and rat holes, they must be filled firmly before adding soil.</p>
<p>19. At ferries and roads, a road slope of 1:15 should be built. If it is a new road, it should not be at right angles to the embankment body. On the river side, it should descend in the same direction as the water flow. On the land side, it should rise in the same direction as the water flow.</p>
<p>20. Bridges must be built or temporary wooden bridges must be built across the new river's transportation arteries to facilitate workers. The supervisor should report to the section office and send personnel to plan in detail and report to the engineering office for approval.</p>
<p>21. When the engineering of each section is completed, the laborers should be ordered to repair and tidy up the new river bottom, bank slope, embankment top, and embankment slope to avoid the disadvantages of uneven height and width.</p>
<p>22. If there are any omissions in these detailed rules, the section office should refer to the actual situation and report to the engineering office for approval and handling.</p>
<p>Notice: Today's newspaper has temporarily added a special issue on Huai River Management, so the special issue on telecommunications will be delayed by one day and will be published on the 2nd. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3 id="e205">New Thoughts on National Products <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Chinese people should use Chinese goods. Mr. He Yingqin, during his visit to the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory and the Ya Pu Er Electrical Appliance Factory a few days ago, immediately inscribed the eight characters "Chinese people should use Chinese goods." How straightforward and refreshing these eight characters are! Indeed, as Chinese people, we should naturally use Chinese goods. If one is Chinese but only values using foreign goods, that means forgetting that one is Chinese. No matter what, I always feel that it is shameful and not honorable. Further, Chinese people should make Chinese goods, and Chinese people should sell Chinese goods. Only then can we be worthy of ourselves, worthy of our ancestors, worthy of society, and worthy of the nation. I also hope that Mr. He, upon returning to North China, will promote this situation.</p>
<p>Truly National Products One day, I heard Mr. Lu Zhixue telling a joke. He said: "On Sunday, I went for a walk in the park and saw a future master of China lying in a cradle, babbling. Mr. Lu took a look and saw that the cradle was produced by a national goods company, but the people who came to see it all stood around smiling. Mr. Lu observed carefully and realized that they were all laughing at the large characters on the cradle. The cradle was engraved with four large characters: 'Truly National Products.'" Ah, "Truly National Products," these four characters seem very humorous, but they are very touching.</p>
<p>The Chairman is a Regular Customer Chairman Lin Zichao of the National Government, with his youthful appearance and beautiful beard, is approachable. The other day, he made a special trip to the China National Goods Company to visit and purchase national products. For a time, the onlookers were shoulder to shoulder, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor. Later, after meeting with Manager Fang Yexian, Li Kangnian, and Sales Director Shen Jinghui, it was learned that Chairman Lin only visits Shanghai occasionally, but whenever he does, he always visits the company. The Chairman is a regular customer of the company. When the Chairman promotes national goods and loves to use them, it helps to change the atmosphere and influence customs. This is very effective and cannot be compared to ordinary ribbon-cutting and joining in the fun.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Hunan People My friend, Mr. Lu, attended the Changsha China National Goods Company and returned to Shanghai to describe the development of the Changsha National Goods Company. He said that on the opening day, women from all over the city came to buy goods. The shop assistants were overwhelmed, and even the chairman of the board, Director Tan Qian, and Manager Huo, personally came out to make transactions. Several other stores selling national goods also did an extra one or two thousand yuan in business that day. The people of Hunan are very strong and have a lot of integrity. They are most opposed to unscrupulous merchants and those who sell enemy goods. It is said that they have killed several shameless merchants. Therefore, the establishment of a national goods company is naturally welcomed by everyone.</p>
<p>Suggestions for National Products</p>
<h3 id="e206">Suggestions for a Mobile Exhibition of National Products <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— A Laborer from Southern China</p>
<p>—Yin salt is not far away, other mountains can be used to grind it—</p>
<p>According to a recent Warsaw dispatch: Poland will soon send an exhibition ship carrying the country's industrial and agricultural products to various countries in the Far East for a practical and effective mobile exhibition. The planned route of this exhibition ship and the Eastern commercial ports to be publicly exhibited are: Port Said, Penang, Swettenham, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Dalian, Yokohama, etc.</p>
<p>Poland is one of the countries that revived after the European War, and it seems to have no commercial position in the Far East. Among the imported goods we usually use, we rarely see "Made in Warsaw" or "Made in Poland." Their shipping industry has not yet shown its strength in the Far East. However, in order to promote the sale of their country's industrial and agricultural products in overseas markets, they do not hesitate to invest and specially send commercial ships to the Far East for practical mobile advertising.</p>
<p>This makes me feel that it is not enough for our national goods industry to simply shout and exhibit behind closed doors. There are seven or eight million overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands alone, who welcome the arrival of genuine national goods. The chambers of commerce in various ports in Nanyang often want to hold large-scale national goods exhibitions, but they suffer from a lack of contact with domestic national goods merchants. It is also very troublesome to send valuable national goods back and forth. If there are too few goods or they are too ordinary, the scale of the exhibition will be small, and it will not be enough to display the true image of a vast land with abundant resources. The results obtained will naturally not be great.</p>
<p>In the winter of the nineteenth year [of the Republic], I passed through Manila. At that time, the Chinese businessmen in the Philippines were holding a national goods exhibition through the YMCA. They had prepared for four or five months beforehand and spent a lot of effort collecting goods. On that day, in addition to a large group of overseas Chinese, there were many Western couples and wealthy indigenous Filipinos who came to visit the exhibition. It is a pity that there were not many goods on display.</p>
<p>At that time, I thought that if large-scale national goods exhibitions could be held everywhere in the Nanyang ports, it would definitely be of great benefit to the outward development of national goods. However, it is not easy to completely rely on local overseas Chinese merchants to do this.</p>
<p>At present, domestic national goods merchants already have commercially rationalized organizations for production and sales cooperation. If we could take a lesson from Poland and specially transport and ship national goods to Nanyang, Manila, Saigon, Singapore, Penang, Yangon, Deli Medan, Batavia, Surabaya, Sandakan, and other places, circumnavigating for a large-scale mobile exhibition, I think it would be ten thousand times more practical and effective than simply declaring a national goods year.</p>
<p>Talking about National Products</p>
<h3 id="e207">General Mobilization for Promoting National Products <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The National Goods Year of last year has passed, and the Women's National Goods Year of this year is about to end. What have been the achievements of the past two years? I can't bear to say it, but I dare not say it, because the customs statistics clearly tell us that in the past nine months of this year, imports have exceeded exports by more than 250 million silver dollars!</p>
<p>Is it because the promotion has not been vigorous enough? I don't think so. Because the industrial and commercial sectors have been running around shouting themselves hoarse: the intellectuals have been verbally criticizing and writing articles until their tongues and lips are worn out: and there are even some people with lofty ideals who have used bombs as warnings, resulting in imprisonment. There is no lack of such people. Planting such a cause and obtaining such a result is truly disheartening!</p>
<p>Lamenting is useless, we still have to struggle. In this nine-out-of-ten-deaths situation, we still have to make a final effort for national products. I now have a few concrete methods in mind, I don't know if they will work? I am writing them out to discuss with you:</p>
<p>(1) Promote National Goods Education Elementary school students are the future masters. We believe that most of the general adults who have been deeply poisoned by foreign goods are beyond salvation. All our hopes are placed on these young citizens. However, they are like a blank piece of cloth, which becomes blue when dyed blue and yellow when dyed yellow. If we do not train them strictly at this time, they will become foreign goods fanatics in the future. Therefore, in addition to promoting virtue, we should include the use of national goods as an item in daily standard life. If they get used to it when they are young, they will not change their minds when they grow up. Ten years of teaching may yield unexpected effects and harvests.</p>
<p>(2) Those in power should lead by example The government issues brilliant instructions to promote national goods. However, if those in power cannot lead by example, these instructions are as good as nothing. If a major official in a locality can say it and do it, and uses national goods himself, gradually extending it to his subordinates and officials, would the common people dare not follow suit? During the tenth year of the Republic [1921], Feng Yuxiang was the military governor of Henan. He liked frugality and wore a cloth robe and ate hard food. He led by example, and in a few months, no one could find anyone wearing silk in Kaifeng. Using this as an example, as long as those in power promote and implement it, there is no fear of failure.</p>
<p>(3) People Organize National Goods Ten-Person Groups Many people always buy foreign goods secretly. Their conscience is not completely dead, and they always feel a little ashamed. At this time, as long as someone dissuades them, they will naturally not buy them. We are now voluntarily organizing a national goods ten-person group to persuade people to join. Each group is made up of ten people, who supervise and encourage each other. If one person violates the rules, the others will report it. First, there will be persuasion, then punishment, and if they still do not listen, they will be expelled from the group. Everyone has a sense of shame. If everyone else is using national goods at this time and they refuse to use them, wouldn't they regret it so much that they would have no place to hide! From one group to ten groups to a hundred to a thousand to ten thousand, if all the people in the country become members, will foreign goods still have a foothold in our country!</p>
<p>Regarding the above three items, I hope that the officials in the government and the well-known figures in the education sector will promote them first; and all sectors will respond afterward. If we gather the strength of the people of the whole country and launch a general mobilization to promote national goods, the country may have a few hopes of becoming rich and strong!</p>
<p>New News from the National Goods Industry in a Week</p>
<p>(1) Our country's leather goods exports have increased sharply this year, reaching more than 23 million yuan in the first half of the year, surpassing silk and tea to become the first.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Beware of Cheap Used Books <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yun</p>
<p>Recently, cheap used books have often been sold on the market, such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "The Family Letters of Zeng Wenzhenggong," "Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observations," etc. The books are printed on newsprint, bound in Western style, with modern punctuation, printed very clearly, and bound very beautifully. The price is very cheap, the cheapest I have ever seen. Most are sold at 10% of the original price, at most 20% or 30%. The complete "Dream of the Red Chamber" used to cost at least one dollar to buy, but now it can be bought for 20 cents. At first, I thought this was the result of the recession, and it was no different from the big sales in ordinary bookstores, but there are so many of these cheap used books on the market that it is shocking. The sidewalks in front of Western-style houses and buildings are often covered with these cheap used books for sale, and I can't help but feel a little suspicious. It wasn't until yesterday that I saw a Guangzhou special report in the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily sent from Hong Kong that I suddenly realized. This special report is like this:</p>
<h3 id="e209">Two Kinds of Inferior Goods Dumped in Guangzhou Recently <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Fresh Fruits and Cheap Books</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, after the fall of the northeastern provinces, all Chinese people have been filled with righteous indignation! However, it has only been a short time, and there is no place in the country where enemy goods are not being dumped, almost everywhere we look, causing foreigners to often laugh at our people for their five-minute enthusiasm, which is truly lamentable. Recently, it has been found that the enemy goods being dumped that have newly occupied the market position in Guangzhou are, first, fresh fruits from Taiwan, with Kinzan oranges, apples, and dragon tooth bananas being the most numerous. These kinds of fruits belong to enemy goods and were rarely seen in this city before, but this year they are being dumped in particular, and the number is also considerable. The second is cheap books. These books are completely printed on inferior foreign paper. It is said that after the inferior paper was unsalable, the enemy colluded with unscrupulous merchants to reprint all of our old books and novels that were not copyrighted, and sold them cheaply at 10% or 20% of the original price. Therefore, these inferior paper books are selling very well, and the number is also alarming.</p>
<p>So there is such a dark secret!</p>
<p>Chinese old books have no copyright, so the Japanese use the method of reprinting old books to promote their unsalable paper. No wonder they are selling so cheaply, they are only trying to recover the cost of the paper!</p>
<p>Their methods are truly both clever and vicious! We know that they will print the trademarks of Chinese national goods on their products to sell to Chinese people. They not only manufacture goods used by the middle class and above in our country, but also manufacture goods used by the peasants in the countryside (such as the coarse blue and white bowls used by the peasants for eating, which are also manufactured by Japan and sold to China). Now they are playing this new trick again!</p>
<p>Foreigners' cunning minds are all-pervasive, how should we step up and build our defenses!</p>
<h3 id="e210">National Products and Dance Halls <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Dao Qin</p>
<p>The cry of rural bankruptcy is rampant, and the construction of urban enjoyment is indeed a distorted development. In Shanghai, the "ten-mile foreign concession," in recent years, singing platforms and dance pavilions have been built in rows, the city is open all night, the temptation of sex is like intoxication, the pursuit of flesh is like leprosy: here, at a glance, men and women, dressed in fancy clothes, the men are in Western suits and leather shoes, their hair is covered in Stancombe hair cream, shining brightly, and sprayed with Four Seven One One perfume, smelling fragrant, purely a bunch of young masters who spend money like dirt: the women have curly hair, high heels, lipstick, rouge, and powder, showing off their Juna-like figures, delicate and charming, fully revealing themselves as charming girls who cherish their youth and sell their charm.</p>
<p>It can be said that all the men and women here, their clothes, food, shelter, and transportation are all tainted with foreign air, and they have adopted European customs. They are purely the main customers and loyal promoters of enemy goods and foreign goods. Asking half of them to promote the use of national goods is simply as unrelated as a horse and an ox!</p>
<p>However, then again, promoting national goods is not something that can be effective in a very short time. If everyone, men and women, abandons all Europeanized clothing and decorations, never wears Western suits and leather shoes, and never puts on hair oil and powder, and everyone is determined to be a pioneer in promoting homespun cloth dancing and promoting frugal dancing, I think if we can shout this out loud, the masses will respond, and the great effect of changing customs and habits will be more than doubled?</p>
<p>Because the fashionable clothing that is popular in the streets, and the cosmetics and perfumes that are widely sold, are mostly used by singers and dancers first, and then imitated by ordinary women who love vanity and fashion. Most of the pursuit of a certain item and the innovation of clothing styles are due to the singers and dancers acting as typical examples. Therefore, promoting national goods must also start from singing platforms and dance pavilions, precisely because we want to use their great magic of changing customs and habits to make a final movement in the Women's National Goods Year.</p>

<h3 id="e211">A Record of the Display of Goods Grade Specimens at the North Railway Station <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, in order to promote national goods, organized a goods grade specimen exhibition room at the Shanghai North Railway Station, and the opening ceremony was scheduled to be held on November 1st. Yesterday, invitations were sent to the leaders of various agencies and organizations to attend the ceremony. This is a good news within the Women's National Goods Year. Therefore, Choucheng made a special trip to the North Railway Station to inquire about the progress of the preparations so far from the person in charge. According to him: The railway authorities, because merchants want to purchase local products, but do not know which place produces abundant products, when a certain product matures, how to pack it and transport it to Shanghai, which is the simplest and easiest to promote sales, so they specially sent staff to the railway line to conduct a detailed investigation, where agricultural products are abundant, where industry is developed, where there are many fish, and where there are minerals. The quality and quantity are investigated clearly, and a list is reported back to Shanghai, and then a list of names is issued, and samples are solicited or purchased from various places, and transported to Shanghai one by one, inspected, and classified. According to the output and price, the number of car transportation costs is set up, and tree windows are set up to display various samples and specimens (those with large quality and inconvenient to display samples, models are made according to the original style, and explanations are added), and they are displayed separately. All are marked with labels, detailing the categories of goods, the level of freight, the address of the product, the annual output, the wholesale price of retail, and the place of sale, so that visitors can see at a glance what they want to handle, and go directly to the place of origin to order, and hand it over to the train for transportation, without having to ask east and west, which can avoid procrastination. At present, those that have been received are roughly divided into five categories: one is mineral products, two is agricultural products, three is forest products, four is poultry and livestock, three is handicrafts, and five categories, the most handicrafts, including metal, copper, iron, kiln products, wood, bamboo, rattan, leather, sail, felt, paper, bone, glue, mat various utensils, as well as cotton, wool, silk various textiles. Mechanical railway mining electrical various materials, paint dye various raw materials, children's toys, household items, about twenty-eight kinds of partners, agricultural products is the second, divided into fifteen categories, including grain, fruit, vegetables, flowers, tea, medicine, etc., mineral products is the next, including coal, slate, mud, soil and other seven categories. Forest products and poultry and livestock are the least, one is four categories such as tree seeds, and the other is five categories such as live poultry, fish, shrimp, fur, etc. Twenty glass cabinets have been made, ready to be arranged in order around the inquiry office, for people to visit. In a word, the national goods collected this time contain all the essential elements of life, including clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The quality and beauty are all excellent, which shows that our country has a vast land and abundant resources, and all handicrafts are not inferior to others. Why should we be addicted to foreign goods to learn fashion, so that the rights and interests flow out, and the words are stern, it seems that we deeply hate the annual increase in imports and sigh that those who do not love the country like to buy foreign goods without a heart, and urge us to publicize it as much as possible to wake it up, so we specially mourn it and it is also what the patriotic compatriots who like to use national goods want to hear.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Common Expression of Students from Various Universities Regarding the Prohibition of Entering Dance Halls <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Dancing is not allowed by the new life, and young people should strive to practice it.</p>
<p>To reverse the declining trend, it is especially important for social leaders to lead by example.</p>
<p>Since the joint association of various universities and the school authorities resolved to strictly prohibit students from entering dance halls and dancing, Kong Xiangxi and Wang Zhengting, executive members of the Shanghai District Group of the China Christian Faith and National Salvation Ten-Person Country, also sent letters to the Public Concession, the French Concession, the Public Works Bureau, and the university authorities to ban it. A Shanghai reporter specially asked the opinions of student organizations from various universities in this city on this matter. According to Deng Kangxi, chairman of the Student Union of Jiaotong University, Ren Guqun, chairman of the Student Union of Soochow University, Pan Deguang, chairman of the Student Union of Hujiang University, and the spokespersons of the student organizations of Daxia, Fudan, and Jinan Universities, since Chairman Chiang advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the whole country has unanimously believed that only by implementing the New Life can China have a way out, and the students of our universities in Shanghai can especially understand this and unanimously raise the banner to practice it. Therefore, there was the organization of the New Life Promotion Association of Students from Various Universities before, and branch associations were established in various schools to practice it personally, without daring to slack off. As for entering dance halls and dancing with dancers, it was originally listed as a strict prohibition in the New Life outline and is in the list of things to be thoroughly eliminated. However, there are still some people who do not restrain themselves and still set foot in dance halls, which cannot be said to be completely non-existent. Therefore, to those who advocate prohibiting university students from entering dance halls, the students should show deep sympathy from the perspective of promoting the New Life Movement. However, considering that the decline of social customs is not limited to dance halls, and those who are drunk and lustful in dance halls are not limited to universities, therefore, if we want to shift fashion and refresh society, all aspects should bear their respective responsibilities, and it is especially important for social leaders to be able to practice it personally and lead by example, so that the wind will blow and the grass will fall, and we can achieve the effect of universal advocacy and supervision.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Recent Status of the Academic Work Consultation Office <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 31st) Since the National Academic Work Consultation Office started registration, 500 people have requested forms. Because the forms must be signed and sealed by the school principal or the head of the institution, only 52 forms have been received. The registration forms (for staff of academic institutions) are sent to various institutions, and only the Nanchang Camp has sent out 50 copies, because the camp needs to add various professional talents. In addition, the office received a letter from the Shanghai Dagong Vocational School, requesting to introduce a director of the mechanical engineering department, who should teach 19 hours a week with a monthly salary of 120 yuan. However, among the mechanical engineering personnel in the registration forms received by the office, there are only two people. One has already taken a job elsewhere, and there is still one person named Yi, who graduated from a mechanical engineering school in Belgium. The salary he hopes for is higher than that given by the Dagong Vocational School. The office has introduced both parties to negotiate, so that the employer can get a practical talent and the employee can get a suitable job. In addition, the office also received letters from vocational referral agencies in various places, requesting mutual cooperation, and all have replied in agreement. However, detailed measures need to be drafted separately.</p>

<p>Secretary-General Wang Shiying Temporarily Replaces Him</p>
<p>The Student Union of Zhejiang University telegraphed yesterday that Guo Renyuan, President of Zhejiang University, expelled two fourth-year students from the Physics Department and the Mathematics Department due to cumulative reasons and at the request of a minority, which caused dissatisfaction among all students. Most of the faculty members also sympathized with the students because the punishment was excessive. On the 30th, Guo accepted the students' request and restored the two students' student status, and resigned to the department because he recognized that the school's management principles were wrong, claiming that he would never return to the school. Students are attending classes as usual. Before the new president is appointed, the school affairs will be temporarily replaced by Secretary-General Wang Shiying, Zhejiang University Student Union.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Changshu Will Issue Education Bonds <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Clearing Up Years of Backlogged Education Fees</p>
<p>The Changshu County education budget allocates 400,000 yuan annually. However, due to large-scale fictitious income and actual expenditure, there have been significant deficits over the past three years. Furthermore, the director has changed four times, leading to confusion about the exact figures and a lack of clear resolution. Currently, the second session of the local education representative assembly has been established, placing great emphasis on clearing up the backlogged education fees. The assembly has a plan for addressing this issue. On the afternoon of the 30th, the assembly sent representatives Cai Degong and Jiang Gonglu to the county government to petition. County Magistrate Du Huan personally received them. The representatives explained the situation following the chaos of war. The county magistrate expressed deep sympathy, but emphasized that the restructuring plan should be drafted first by the county education bureau, together with the county party headquarters, enthusiastic local figures, education association representatives, and representatives from various schools, to form a committee to clear the backlogged debts. They should start by investigating the amount owed to each school. If cash is insufficient, they will follow the example of Wu County and issue education bonds, using tax collection as collateral, with the county bureau responsible. Magistrate Qu expressed agreement with this plan, promising to implement it as soon as Education Bureau Director Lu Jingmo returns to the county from the province. However, education association representatives requested that it be realized and completed within this month (November). The county magistrate agreed to expedite the process. As for the July expenses falsely reported to the Education Department, he promised to release the funds immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Wireless Radio Broadcasting Association Initiated <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Promoting the Development of Radio Broadcasting and Improving Broadcasting Content</p>
<p>Preparatory Office Temporarily Located at the Sino-Western Radio Station on Fourth Road</p>
<p>Local social education figures Ding Shoutang, Xu Zhuodai, Yuan Zengyu, Lü Haigang, and others believe that wireless radio broadcasting is closely related to social education. To promote the development of this emerging industry, improvement in many aspects is essential. In particular, regarding content, most radio stations focus on entertainment, and their obscene and vulgar content not only leads to the corruption of listeners' minds but also hinders the courage of the entire nation to move forward. Therefore, they have jointly organized the China Wireless Radio Broadcasting Association with radio broadcasting colleagues Zhou Bangjun, Wang Youyou, Liu Chunshan, Liu Ziyun, Liu Shuzhi, and over thirty others. They have already followed the regulations of the central government's public organization plan and completed the filing procedures with the municipal party and government authorities. The preparatory office is temporarily located at the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Road. According to Mr. Ding, the association's mission is to unite radio broadcasting colleagues nationwide, work together to promote the broadcasting industry to assist in the implementation of social education, and improve content to enhance listeners' knowledge, correct national bad habits, and revitalize the national spirit.</p>

<p>Liangjiang Women's School in Jiangwan has been actively developing in recent years and has gained the trust of people across the country. The number of students coming from afar is increasing, with enthusiastic participation even from remote areas. For example, the Shaanxi Education Department, due to the lack of physical education talent in the province, specially sent two students to the school to study, in order to develop the physical education cause in the Northwest. Although the school has experienced several ups and downs in the past ten years, it has moved forward without slackening, demonstrating the painstaking efforts of Principal Lu Lixue. Currently, the school pays special attention to the students' intellectual and moral development in all aspects. Principal Lu personally supervises morning exercises and invites prominent figures from all walks of life to give lectures at the school every week during memorial gatherings.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal First Sports Field, in order to arouse citizens' interest in sports, had invited Fu Baolu, a famous pole vaulting athlete in China, to perform a public pole vaulting demonstration at the field on November 3rd. It has now been learned that because Mr. Fu has been feeling unwell recently, he may not be able to attend at that time. The event has been postponed to December 1st (Saturday) at 2:00 PM. The correspondence between the two parties is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Fu to the Municipal First Sports Field: Director Zhuangfei, With respect, I was honored to be invited by your field to perform pole vaulting at 2:00 PM on November 3rd.

<p>Megauff and Henbestal</p>
<p>Took a detour through Europe to Return to America</p>
<p>Unable to See the Black Wind</p>
<p>The top-notch American track and field athletes Megauff and others passed through Shanghai on the 16th of last month on their way to perform in the Philippines. The local National Sports Association invited them to perform once when they passed through Shanghai on their way back to the United States. It was originally scheduled for six athletes, but the Association received a telegram from the team yesterday that the number of athletes coming to Shanghai has been reduced to four and will arrive in Shanghai at 11:30 AM tomorrow. They will perform in the afternoon. The situation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e236">Only Four Remaining <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Of the six members of the American track and field tour, Megauff and Henbestal were originally scheduled to return to the United States via Europe after performing in the Philippines. However, when they passed through Shanghai last time, they had agreed to the request of our organization. Unexpectedly, the Association received a telegram from Hong Kong last night notifying us that Mac and Heng were unable to come to Shanghai as agreed due to unforeseen circumstances. They have landed in Hong Kong and will return to their country via Europe. The remaining four have boarded the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru, which is passing through Hong Kong to Shanghai. The performance originally scheduled for November 2nd will still be held on time. However, it is a great pity that we will not be able to witness the skills of the two world-renowned figures Mac and Heng. It is learned that the ship will arrive at the port at 11:30 AM tomorrow morning and will land at the Huishan Wharf. At 3:30 PM that afternoon, they will go to Shen Garden to perform as agreed with the Association.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Performance Program <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The American athletes arriving in Shanghai tomorrow include Deng, Crowley, Cunningham, and Green. The program for tomorrow's performance will include five events: 400 meters, 800 meters, 3,000 meters, discus, and shot put. If the American athletes agree, a relay race will be added. As for the number of other participants, it is estimated that there will be two Chinese, two McInnes, and two British athletes for each event. Tickets are priced at one yuan and one and a half yuan. The athletes are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the original ship on the 3rd.</p>

<p>Holding Sports Meets Once a Week</p>
<p>The Goal is to Promote Track and Field Skills</p>
<p>Local track and field comrades, in view of the backwardness of our country's track and field achievements, due to the lack of training opportunities throughout the year and stimulated by the recent expedition of the American track and field team to the East, they have decided to initiate individual competitions to increase interest in sports. Currently, Cheng Jinguan, Fu Baolu, and Qian Xing are in the process of initiating a Chinese individual track and field competition promotion. It is heard that the initiators of the association are Cheng, Fu, Qian, Sun Huipu, Su Xiaoru, Gong Wanyu, Zou Shande, Huang Shengbai, Xu Duo, Ruan Weicun, Kang Kongzhao, Zhou Bangzhe, Zhang Jiazhen, and dozens of others. The purpose of the association is completely different from that of ordinary track and field teams. The goal is to test results and not to compete against other teams. The association will first be initiated automatically by the sports community and then invite sports experts from all over Shanghai as sponsors and directors to expand the organization. Anyone can join as a member, aiming to integrate the entire Shanghai sports community into one. It is heard that the association will launch its activities in mid-month, with the first event planned to be a 5,000-meter open road race around the city (running one lap on the Sanlu Yuan Road). The second event is planned to be the Shanghai men's and women's 100-meter championship. Each competition will be divided into groups to ensure that athletes of varying levels do not compete in the same group. The details will be announced as soon as they are finalized. The aim of the association is to promote this competition method nationwide in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Cheng Zhiqian looked at his hesitant expression, and it was difficult to answer well, and it was also bad not to answer. He reached into his pocket to explore for a while, pretending to take out a cigarette, and just kept pondering in his heart. In fact, he didn't smoke, but borrowed this opportunity to hesitate, so that he could think of something to say. After a long time, he thought of a sentence and smiled: "I am also a newcomer to Xi'an, and I am not very familiar with the situation here. But I think that there are also many poor people in Xi'an. If there is no man in the family, should finding a husband's family for the girl be considered an outlet? For example, like your sister-in-law, washing clothes for others and selling some strength is also a way to eat, right? You went to Little Western Paradise to find someone for the girl, that's wrong. All the people there are from outside, without roots and without foundation. Marrying the girl to this kind of person only cares about the present, but what will happen in the future?" Cheng Zhiqian felt that what he said was reasonable and logical. But when Aunt Hu heard it, almost every word was a bit harsh. But she had invited the person, so she must not offend him. She could only smile and say: "Mr. Cheng is right, but everyone has their own difficulties." Cheng Zhiqian clearly knew that she was unwilling, but that didn't matter to his own purpose, he just wanted to see the poor people's families. So he stood up and smiled: "Well, I will be staying in Xi'an for a while, and I will help if you need my help in the future. I just want to see what the situation is like in your poor families. Can I take a look at your house?" Aunt Hu thought, this girl, from the front yard to the backyard of Little Western Paradise, and then to the house, I've really let you see enough, do you still want to see? As long as you are willing to see, then it will be easy to handle, so she smiled and said: "We are such a broken family, I'm just afraid you won't want to see it. If you are willing to see it, then you are our savior. Please take a look." As she said that, she pushed the two wooden doors towards the house, which was considered to mean inviting the guest to enter. (54)</p>
<h3 id="e250">A Record of an Old Man Traveling Around the World <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Those who are only past middle age, with blurred vision, gray hair, shaky teeth, and a senile appearance, are not uncommon in the country. Now, looking at an old man who travels around the world, wouldn't it be more感人to see how different the physiques of Chinese and foreigners are? Mr. Jules Brétepond, the old man, is the Paul of today's Macau. When Mr. Qiu was six years old, he had traveled with his family on long trips. Now, at the age of seventy, he is still very interested in traveling. His travels have already reached Penang Island. He is an American from Southern California, and is seventy-six years old. He used to run a stock business, and has been traveling every year since he retired twenty years ago. This leisurely trip is the fifteenth time he has traveled around the world. Although his beard and hair are as silver, his spirit is very strong, and his steps are healthy, and his heart is happy and pleasant, which makes people know it at a glance. It is said that the oldest youth in the world, with the longest and most optimistic journey, must be Mr. Qiu. From this, it can be imagined that he is getting stronger with age. Mr. Shi's trip around the world was on the President Garfield of the Dalai Company. When asked about his travel impressions, he said: "In total, the journey I have traveled is no less than one million miles, and the cost has reached tens of thousands of dollars. I firmly believe that the best way to make people live longer and stay young is to travel. In the future, I will continue to travel, and I will wait until I die. I estimate that the only places I have not been to are Siberia and Iceland, and I expect that in the near future, I will be able to realize my wish and go for a tour. As for the mileage, the total will be more than two million miles. I am seventy-six years old, and I am getting old. But I am confident that my youthful enthusiasm is no less than before, and I like to be with young people, and I can still swim and dance. All of this is given by travel. Only travel can truly make people young and full of vitality, and now everything is progressing smoothly and comfortably, and the cost is half as much as three years ago. I especially hope that people will remember the joy of traveling to enjoy the supreme pleasure of the body and mind."</p>

<p>If you show off all your diplomas, from elementary school to middle school, university, and even studying abroad, you still have nothing to do. Some people who haven't gone to school and don't have diplomas can lie at home and get paid for nothing, and go in and out of cars, as long as they have good sisters and good relatives. If you're mad about it, it's your fault.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Examination of Shaved Eyebrows <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Eyebrows grow above the eyes, and their function is, firstly, to prevent sweat from the forehead from flowing into the eyes, just like eyelashes; secondly, the eyes must be supported by the eyebrows in order to show their majesty. Therefore, according to the former statement, eyebrows are like guards of the eyes, without them, the eyes will be bullied by the sweat of the forehead; according to the latter statement, eyebrows are like honored guests of the eyes, without them, only the master—eyes—cannot form etiquette.</p>
<p>Since eyebrows help the eyes, we should protect them well. Unexpectedly, modern fashionable women are willing to shave them away. After shaving them, they feel that it's too bare and ugly, so they draw two thin, narrow, slender ones, which look like they are and aren't. Alas! The guards have been withdrawn. Although the honored guests are still there, they exist in name only. It cannot be said that this is not the eyebrow's misfortune.</p>
<p>Examining it in ancient times, the fashion of shaving eyebrows was also popular in the Tang Dynasty. There is a story in the Tang Yulin written by Wang Dang of the Song Dynasty: "During the Changqing period, the women's headdresses in the capital, with gold, green, pearls, jade, hairpins, combs, and swaying ornaments, were all beautiful, and were called 'hundreds of unknowns'. Women removed their eyebrows, and drew three or four horizontal lines of cinnabar and purple above and below their eyes, which was called 'blood halo makeup'." According to the ancient Beijing makeup, like the current Shanghai fashionable makeup, it was the most beautiful, and the most fashionable. As far as eyebrows are concerned, the so-called palace eyebrows are often quoted in ancient people's poems, and the examples are countless. According to Tang Yulin, the love of fashion of women at that time can be seen. Headdresses only seek beauty, and spare no effort to seek it, so it is said that "hundreds of unknowns." As for removing the eyebrows and drawing three or four horizontal lines of cinnabar and purple above and below the eyes, it is probably not very beautiful. The name of the blood halo makeup, weighed with the knowledge of latitude, is even more unclear. In recent times, the eyes of Hua Dan in Qin Opera seem to have thin lines drawn above and below, which may be the legacy of the blood halo makeup of the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>"The depth of drawing eyebrows is in fashion." This can prove that people in ancient times regarded eyebrows as an important decoration on the face. But this refers to supplementing the defects of natural eyebrows. Now that the eyebrows have suffered misfortune, if the eyelashes are aware, they should also sigh that the mission they bear is too great.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Talking About Kunshan Duck Noodles <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zixin</p>
<p>The pressure of life has made me very distant and indifferent to my hometown—Kunshan. My own close home has turned into a foreign land. How painful is such a long separation! In quiet moments, I often reminisce, and my hometown is worth cherishing, but reminiscing is still reminiscing. In fact, the heart and desire are separated, which only adds to the pain.</p>
<p>I remember, at that time, I hadn't left my hometown yet. Every morning, I would stroll to the noodle shop alone and eat as much duck noodles as possible. At that time, I didn't have any special impression.</p>
<p>After being separated from my hometown and listening to people's praise and my own attempts, my previous views have changed. The duck noodles in my hometown are indeed better than the general duck noodles sold in the market. Fresh, glutinous, fat, and cheap are the characteristics. The general praise is probably due to this reason.</p>
<p>Among the duck noodle shops in my hometown, the first to be mentioned is Longshun Pavilion in Xuanhua Lane near the main street. Their noodles are more glutinous and finer than ordinary ones, and their ducks are more tender than ordinary ones. The noodles and the duck only cost twenty-eight copper coins, and you can taste this delicious and delicious duck noodles. Other restaurants in Baihua Street and Banshan Bridge seem to be slightly inferior to Longshun Pavilion.</p>
<h3 id="e254">The Piao Miao Record of Imperial Incense <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After the Empress Dowager's carriage was properly arranged, we had to hurry into the palace to change our status from being attendants accompanying the Empress Dowager on her eastern tour to being guards left behind in the Fengtian Palace, waiting for the Holy Empress Dowager to return – which is really ridiculous – what is referred to here as 'we' does not only refer to us eight female officials, but also includes Emperor Guangxu, Empress Longyu, and Concubine Jin; because their status in relation to the Empress Dowager is generally that of subjects – although we had to enter the palace first, we were not able to enter through the central main gate, and were not allowed to ride in sedan chairs; therefore we all got out of the sedan chairs one after another, and let Emperor Guangxu lead the way, walking into the smaller doorway on the left in single file. As soon as we entered, we saw a very large courtyard, but our welcoming ceremony could not be held in this courtyard; we walked through it and entered a second courtyard of the same size, and then from the second courtyard, we walked to the third courtyard, which was even larger, about twice the size of the previous one. We rested in this courtyard to prepare for the ceremony.</p>
<p>When we came in, we had brought in the original ancient music team in the palace, and the Western music team that Yuan Shikai had lent to the Empress Dowager; but constrained by custom, the Western music team could not of course play in this formal ceremony, so we had to rely on the annoying ancient music team as before.</p>
<p>At this time, in each courtyard and in each palace, there were already many eunuchs distributed to serve. Half of these eunuchs had always been stationed here; most of the rest had been sent by Li Lianying before the Empress Dowager set off to sweep the halls, arrange the flowers and trees, and prepare everything that was needed, so that when the Empress Dowager and we arrived, there would be no shortage of supplies. (164)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e255">About Servants <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Lingzhi</p>
<p>Although my family subscribes to the Shenbao, I read the articles in the Chunqiu column every day; however, due to busy work, I don't read every article. Even the "Piao Miao Record of Imperial Incense," which I am very interested in, I sometimes read and sometimes don't. Therefore, I didn't see the description of Yuan Shikai calling himself "servant" when he saw the Empress Dowager, nor did I see the attached note a few days later, saying that someone had sent a letter correcting that Han officials should call themselves "subject" according to the Qing system. However, I did see Mr. Yi Sheng's article, "Servants of the Former Qing Dynasty." Because Mr. Yi Sheng's speech was quite incomplete, and because I happened to have existing materials on hand, I took the opportunity to discuss this issue of titles.</p>
<p>(1) It is an old Manchu custom for Manchu officials to call themselves "servant."</p>
<p>The imperial edict to the Grand Councilors, Qianlong 23rd year, 2nd month, Ren Shen, said: "Manchu ministers...should still call themselves 'servant' in regular memorial reports to request peace and express gratitude, in order to preserve the old Manchu custom."</p>
<p>From this, it can be known that it has always been the Manchu system for Manchu officials to call themselves "servant," and it was not newly established by Hong Chengchou.</p>
<p>(2) Not all Manchu officials call themselves "servant."</p>
<p>The same imperial edict says: "Manchu ministers call themselves 'subject' or 'servant' when reporting matters, and the wording is inconsistent. It is ordered to transmit that subsequent official business memorial reports should be called 'subject,' and regular memorial reports to request peace and express gratitude should still be called 'servant'..."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that whether Manchu officials call themselves "subject" or "servant" depends on the nature of the memorial reports, and it is not always the case that they call themselves "servant." However, this only refers to civil officials, not military officials.</p>
<p>(3) When Manchu and Han officials jointly report official business, they use the title of the chief guard as the title.</p>
<p>The imperial edict to the Grand Councilors, Qianlong 35th year, leap May, Ding Wei, says: "Today, Zhou Yuanli, together with Xining, etc., reported on a memorial concerning the search and capture of locust plagues...In the list of names in the memorial, Xining Daling'a called himself 'servant,' while Zhou Yuanli called himself 'subject,' which is quite ridiculous. Subjects and servants are originally one, and are both titles of offering to the superior. Although the meanings of the words are different, the principle is the same. Manchu and Han officials naturally have different titles, but when they encounter ministerial memorial reports, even senior Manchu officials also uniformly call themselves 'subject,' and Manchu governors and governors-general also do so when reporting local official business. It is not that the title of 'servant' is considered humble and close, while the title of 'subject' is considered honorable and distant..." However, the list of titles in the memorial should not be mixed. It should only be based on who is the first title, whether Manchu or Han, and it can be consistent. In this memorial jointly reported by the three people, since Ning's name is listed first and he is called "servant," then Da Ling'a and Zhou Yuanli should write their names directly in succession. Why bother to make distinctions in between?"</p>
<p>However, in another imperial edict, the statement is different.</p>
<p>(4) When Manchu and Han officials jointly report official business, they should uniformly call themselves "subject."</p>
<p>The imperial edict to the Cabinet, Qianlong 38th year, November, Wu Shen, says: "Today, Censor Tianbao and Ma Renlong reported on a memorial concerning the discovery of cheating in the examination of teachers...Because Tianbao was in front in the memorial, they were all called 'servant.' In the past, memorial reports by Manchu officials were generally called 'servant,' and those by Han officials were generally called 'subject.' This is just a continuation of the old practice...It is not that calling oneself 'servant' is close and respectful, while calling oneself 'subject' is distant and discourteous...In the future, all joint reports of official business by Manchu and Han officials, both inside and outside, should uniformly call themselves 'subject,' in order to show unity. It is hereby ordered."</p>
<p>Zhou Yuanli was reprimanded for refusing to follow the Manchus in calling himself "servant," while Ma Renlong was criticized for following the Manchus in calling himself "servant." It can be said that he was caught between a rock and a hard place, and was easily blamed!</p>
<p>(5) There are also Han people who flatter and call themselves "servant."</p>
<p>The imperial edict of Qianlong 38th year, November, Wu Shen, criticized Ma Renlong for calling himself "servant," explaining that he had never discriminated against calling oneself "subject" or "servant," just to prevent ignorant people, or those who flatter and call themselves "servant," and it is necessary to guard against its spread. The imperial edict of Qianlong 35th year, leap May, Ding Mao, also stated that there is no difference between "servant" and "subject," and he never cares about such things. Even if some Han people call themselves "servant" during audiences, there is no intention to reward them. From the sentence "Some Han people call themselves 'servant' during audiences," it can be seen that although Han people do not have to call themselves "servant" as a rule, there are still many Han people who are willing to be servants!</p>
<p>(Note: The above imperial edicts were compiled by Mr. Chen Yuan'an and published in the sixth issue of the Weekly Journal of the Institute of Sinology, Peking University. Readers who wish to see the full text of the imperial edicts can refer to it.)</p>

<p>November public bonds begin to be collected and settled today.</p>
<p>Although London pure gold fell sharply yesterday, the gold market still had some popularity and managed to rise mid-session. The Central Bank's balancing tax was announced, reduced to 7.5%, and market sentiment softened. Afterwards, selling pressure emerged and sentiment reversed, resulting in a fall. The overall trend remained sideways. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw the British market shrink and the American market rise; forward silver market rebounded by 3.5%; exchange rates rose back; and London gold prices plummeted by 8.5 pence, leaving sentiment flat. When pre-market trading opened, it fell to 87.8 yuan, but momentum remained strong, breaking through the 90-yuan mark again. When the Central Bank's listed price was announced, although customs gold decreased by 2%, the standard gold price was reduced to 992.1 yuan, but the listed prices for both British and American exchange rates shrank by 0.0625, stabilizing the market. After the opening, banks showed strong appetite, and the foreign exchange market tightened and rose, but there was much struggle. When the exchange and bank listed prices were announced, the British rate was flat and the American rate rose by 0.125, but because banks were actively dealing with each other, the foreign exchange market remained tight, falling and then rising again. When the Central Bank's balancing tax was announced, reduced to 7.5%, a decrease of half a percent compared to before, selling sentiment turned strong and the price fell, but there was still a rebound. However, sentiment softened because of this, and Chinese merchants sold British and bought American currency, loosening the domestic market. Afterwards, the supply side suddenly became strong, breaking the 90-yuan mark and falling in circles. Banks still had buying appetite, which helped to maintain the price. At noon, the market stabilized after being weak. The half-day market was mediocre, not breaking out of the sideways pattern. Major short sellers held back, the rising momentum was weak, and retail participation was too high, resulting in erratic ups and downs. The total number of chips increased to over 34,000.

<h3 id="e258">Silver and Money Trades Particularly Busy <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate at Eight Percent... Cashier's Check Premium Greatly Increases</p>
<p>Yesterday was the only major settlement period of the tenth decade. The silver and money trades were at the end of a long-term overall closing period. The busyness of the settlement procedures was, as usual, impossible to escape. All kinds of routine settlements were also more tedious than usual. Therefore, the market situation yesterday was a rare one in each year. The interbank lending rate in the foreign market still opened at six percent in the early morning, but in the noon market, due to the Bank of China receiving over two million in cashier's checks, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened and the interbank lending rate rose by two percent, hence eight percent. The premium on cashier's checks initially opened at 0.08 or 0.09 percent, then reached 0.15 or 0.16 percent. The situation suddenly became tense, and people's hearts were stirred. In the interbank lending note transactions, early morning transfers totaled over 4.1 million, new transactions totaled over 500,000, and there were especially many transactions in the noon market, totaling over 1.2 million. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 900,000. The long-term settlement and closing amount for both the silver and money trades totaled over 30 million. Over 2 million in foreign pledges were redeemed, and the amount of new pledges made was as high as nearly 5 million, a huge number. It is said that this session involved over 2 million in housing pledges that had reached the end of their one-year and six-month terms, which is why the amount was particularly high. Bank settlements, due to the excessive number of transactions, could not be checked in detail for the time being and could not be verified. According to rough estimates, foreign banks had over 20 million, Chinese banks had several hundred million, and Japanese banks had approximately 20 million. The number of money shop public bond settlements was too high to estimate in terms of time, but it was approximately 70 to 80 million. The settlement of foreign cashier's checks totaled over 16 million, remittances from various routes totaled over 1.5 million, cash receipts totaled over 1.2 million, banknote receipts totaled over 1.5 million, and banknotes issued totaled over 2.2 million. Customer sources were 300,000, and expenditures were 400,000. Also, the total number of exchanges at the clearing house on the 31st was 17,747,936.51 yuan, including 6,824,798.48 yuan in silver dollars and 10,655,038.03 yuan in silver dollar remittances.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Auxiliary Currency Calm, No Change <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>For several days, the auxiliary coin market has been quiet, with no signs of change. Yesterday's market remained the same as before. The early morning price for Jiangnan small foreign coins was 826 yuan, and the noon price was 827 yuan, an improvement of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions totaled 2500 coins in the early morning and 4000 coins in the noon. The early morning price for Guangdong small foreign coins was 748.9 yuan, and the noon price was 748.6 yuan.

<h3 id="e260">Total Interbank Lending Rate for October <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The total interbank lending rate for October was 2.17 yuan. Among them, the Double Ten holiday had one day off, which should be added by 0.06 yuan, so the total was 2.23 yuan, with an average daily rate of slightly less than 0.072 yuan for 31 days. According to our calculations, the interbank lending rate in foreign markets was slightly higher at the beginning of the month, constantly above 0.1 yuan, but by the 5th and 6th it had already begun to decline. Subsequently, it stood at 0.06 yuan per day until the end of the month, without any change, resulting in the above total. As such, a deposit rate proposal will be made at tomorrow's general meeting, likely at 2 yuan or 2.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Our country has always been a net importer of silver, but this year is uniquely different, with large quantities being exported to Europe and America, all by foreign banks. Since the 15th of this month, after the Ministry of Finance ordered customs to implement an increase in the silver export tax, various foreign banks, having no profit to be made, immediately stopped trading. Therefore, silver exports have been virtually nonexistent for half a month. However, there were occasional exports to South China, but not very large. Yesterday evening, the reporter passed by the Bund Wuma Road Public Works Department pier and saw Rongmao Transport cars fully loaded with silver, being unloaded onto iron barges. Upon inquiry, it was said that they were being loaded by an American bank for transport to England, totaling about 200 boxes, estimated to be worth over 1 million yuan.</p>

<p>Major Investors Tend to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange still rose due to good news from Beiping, with retail investors continuing to buy in. Subsequently, it fell due to major investors selling, and the trend already showed a concentration of bullish retail investors. Upon investigation of transactions in the market, the major investors whose sales were notable were only Numbers 47 and 50. Among the buyers, the financial community sold quite a bit in the afternoon, hence the fallback. The future situation is not optimistic. Yesterday, the opening was extremely firm, retail investors bought in, and major investor Number 47 sold, with the market price increasing by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. In the next round, retail investors still mostly bought in and sold little, with Number 50 selling the most, and the market price continued to increase by around 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, the financial community sold slightly, and retail investors also sold back, falling back by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan, an overall 0.65 yuan. At the close, Number 47 still had selling activity, continuing to fall by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. As a result, the market price fell by between 0.15 yuan and 0.25 yuan. The troop reduction was relatively firm, and the total number of transactions totaled 14,465,000 yuan. This exchange had 20 shares. The results of their rises and falls are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported, "Yesterday (30th), the New York stock market was dull but firm, lacking leadership. The Reo Motor Car Company announced its reorganization, and the stock value was completely eliminated, so the stock fell to a new low. At the same time, Gillette Razor, American Agricultural Chemical, Colgate-Palmolive, Borg-Warner and Universal Leaf Tobacco stocks created high records because of each company's good operating reports. The bond market was mixed and slightly lower. The small exchange was mixed and slightly higher. Chicago wheat improved because there were a large number of settlements recently, and demand improved compared to before, so the market was very strong. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 430,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows."</p>

<p>The yarn market trend slightly weakened because reports said the increase in the consolidated tax was being reconsidered and postponed, and would be difficult to implement on November 1. As a result, sentiment weakened again, Japanese merchants sold off slightly, and the market became weaker. However, current yarn sales were still not bad, but overseas cotton conditions were sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Japanese Merchants Sell Futures Yarn <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn pre-market was due to reports that the increase in the consolidated tax was being reconsidered, causing buying interest to loosen again in the market and prices to fall. The selling pressure in the second and third rounds was slightly stronger. At the same time, it was heard that gold prices were still stable, but Japanese merchants sold off slightly, and the market deteriorated. As a result, each month fell 0.4, 0.7, 0.8 to 1.1 yuan. The opening of the afternoon market was still weak. In the auction to the second and third rounds, some short positions were covered, and each month slightly rose 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 24,900 bales. The sales volume was Dafeng 1600 bales, Shenchang 600 bales, Senkang 900 bales, Taichang 850 bales, Xiesheng 1300 bales, Yuanda 450 bales, Shenji 650 bales, Tongxing 500 bales, Yuanyi 500 bales, and Xincheng 1000 bales.

<p>The cotton market is still flat. Because the matter of yarn factory work stoppages was completely false, the rumors are gradually subsiding. This matter will likely not be realized, causing sentiment to revive. In addition, Tongcheng Company continued to purchase, tightening the market. However, current cotton business is lighter than that for shipping.</p>

<p>The opening of the marked flower pre-market was tighter. Because American cotton rose and fell alternately, but gold prices trended upwards, and yarn factory work stoppages would not be implemented, there were fewer new sellers. Each month rose 0.2 yuan. When the auction reached the third close, the market fell again because the yarn market trended downwards and gold prices slightly fell back. As a result, each month rose 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, short covering tightened the market, and each month rose 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 76,200 piculs. Sales were Yuanda 1100 piculs, Dafu 1600 piculs, Tongfeng 4900 piculs, Shenyu 1000 piculs, Hengde 1000 piculs, Changzhu 1500 piculs, Yifeng 1600 piculs, Changhe 3300 piculs, and Yuanda 1300 piculs.

<p>There is talk of expanding cotton fields.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market placed great pressure on October due to general fear of expanded cotton cultivation acreage in the coming year. Therefore, that month's slump was unusual, and prices fell by 12 pounds. Other than that, there was nothing exciting. At the opening, Liverpool sentiment was excellent, and traders' appetite was still healthy, so prices rose slightly and were able to remain stable. Trading was scarce. December swaps were active (generally trading for the March and May periods). The spot market was as deadlocked as before, and near-term prices rose 1 or 2 pounds. British cotton futures fell 4 or 5 points. Indian cotton was bought by retail brokers, with Pingle falling 1.25 rupees, Robin falling 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi falling 1.75 rupees.

Among them, Fuxin's various factories' Yibing Chuan Wharf receipts totaled 292,000 bags, most of which were new goods, and a small portion were returned goods. Xinda's Yuan Paotai totaled 7000 bags. As for the receiving side, the silver and money gang's hedging totaled around 200,000 bags, and the customer gang and this street received around 80 to 90 thousand bags. The industry insiders were flowing out due to factory receipts, and the quantity was considerable. If actual sales encounter setbacks in the future, there is a risk of decline.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the tenth-month wheat delivery period, with a total of 33 cars. Number 6 delivered 6 cars, Number 23 delivered 13 cars, and Number 26 delivered 11 cars. The receivers were Number 1 receiving 6 cars, Number 6 receiving 13 cars, Number 17 receiving 5 cars, and Number 32 receiving 9 cars. It was heard that the receivers were generally representatives of the factories, with factories such as Huafeng and Xinda receiving around 10 cars each, and the rest being purchased by customer groups.</p>

<p>After the wild drop of the 29th, Chicago wheat rose back today (30th). Brokers were purchasing quite vigorously, and locals were settling more, so there was progress. The market is calm, and there is a current lack of outside participation, so it is predicted that it will not be very strong. The spot market continues to rise, and the difference is even greater. Chicago wheat's closing price on October 29 and closing price on October 30.</p>
<h3 id="e274">River Bottom Rice Market Reverses to Lively <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, over twenty shipments arrived from various origins (totaling over three thousand piculs). The initial quality appeared good. However, wholesale buyers became hesitant, with only the Qingdao group purchasing just over two hundred packages of six varieties. Furthermore, buyers were stricter with their quality standards, rejecting anything not considered top-grade, and driving hard bargains, causing some discouragement. Market conditions suffered a slight setback, but by closing, the market tightened somewhat. The price of new, thin rice like the six varieties improved by several points, while the market for thick, new short-grain rice such as Wild White remained stable. Due to limited supply of imported rice, “Du Yang Jian” brand saw prices increase. Other varieties such as “Bian Yin Yuan” showed no significant change.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, about twenty boats of various goods arrived from the river bottom region. Sales of various rice types in the market: New short-grain, broken short-grain, aged white, “Yuan Yin,” new “Yang Du Jian” saw sluggish wholesale movement. Kiln-dried new and aged "Bu Ke Jian" were relatively active. The market for high-quality new short-grain rice increased by 10-20 cents; medium to low-quality increased by 20-40 cents. Broken short-grain increased by 20 cents. Aged white and "Yuan Yin" increased by 10 cents. Top-quality "Du Jian" increased by 20-30 cents, and mid-to-low quality increased by 10-20 cents. Densely planted new "Yang Jian" and new and aged "Bu Ke Jian" also increased in price.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Locally Grown Indica Rice and Coarse Rice Continue to Rise by 20 Cents <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Fourteen Thousand Packages Sold Inland</p>
<p>Future Imported Rice Sees New Transactions at Higher Price of 9 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, local Indica rice sold very well, and market sentiment was particularly good. While arrivals were continuous, with 4,000 packages from Hunan and Hubei, new shipments from Yueqing, Jiangbei, and Wuhu were limited. All arrivals were snapped up by local buyers. Yesterday, 2,500 packages of Hunan machine-milled rice and 600 packages of Wuhu Indica rice were actively sold in this district. Inland demand was very good. Wuxi buyers were present at the market, competing for purchases. A total of 1,000 packages of Hunan broken and aged rice, 4,500 packages of Hansha coarse rice, and 850 packages of Jiangbei and Yueqing rice were sold. Due to competition among buyers, coarse rice jumped more than 20 cents, and machine-milled rice rose nearly 20 cents. However, Guangdong rice saw no transactions due to suspicion of being mixed with imported rice.</p>
<p>The market for imported rice remained strong. Yesterday, 3,500 packages of Saigon spot rice were sold. Inland buyers took 500 packages each of broken and future imported rice. Prices should have risen, but after the arrival of 50,000 packages from Saigon, importers refused to lower prices. As a result, the price only increased by 3-5 cents. However, speculators held onto future imported rice, expecting higher prices. Yesterday, a British merchant, Jinlong, released 500 tons of March Saigon rice, which was purchased by Yuanfeng at a price of $5.19, 9 cents higher than the previous market price.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Oilseed Cake Market Sees General Increase <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Recently, sales of soybean oil cake have been quite active. The reason is that prices are low and sales are brisk, and prices in producing areas are also reported to be rising, so sellers are mostly holding tight. Yesterday, 14-15 carts of new and aged soybeans were traded in the market, with prices rising by 4-5 cents to 6-7 cents. There were inquiries for bean cake from Wenzhou, Shantou, and other places. Seeing the tightness in the market, traders in this district also started buying, with over 20,000 pieces traded in the overall market. Prices rose by 2 cents in both the morning and afternoon. Soybean oil and peanut oil also continued to rise by 20-30 cents, with 500 pieces of peanut oil and 200 pieces of factory oil traded. A total of 1,500 pieces of Dalian, Niuzhuang, and Qishan oil were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Sugar Market: “Five Blessings” White and Rock Sugar Sold as Soon as They Arrive <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was characterized by firm customs gold, which, while logically indicating tightness, sales remained sluggish, and the trend remained difficult to reverse. The guild set prices for #24 coarse granulated white sugar at $18.80 for spot goods and $18.90 for goods from this store, but there were no transactions at the original prices. Higher-grade #8 and #9 Dutch brown sugar was priced at $14.20, while lower-grade ordinary goods were at $14.05, gradually loosening. Goods for re-export were at $5.10 but were not yet being marked out. Only 100 bags of re-export #24 coarse granulated white sugar were traded at $5.55, a decrease of 5 cents from the previous day. This factory’s cotton white also decreased by 10 cents. #1 Zhenyu ice was at $17.20, and #2 was at $17. The factory’s #1 rock sugar was at $22.90, and #2 rock sugar was at $22.70. The 200 boxes of "Five Blessings" white ice sugar that arrived the day before were reportedly sold out as soon as they arrived, at a price of $17.80 per slab. Future arrivals are temporarily scarce, and market sentiment is very stable.</p>

<p>The Anhai and Tong'an dried longan that arrived around the middle of this month, totaling about a thousand pieces, were being held by the buyers due to their high cost, in anticipation of a better market. However, sales have not been very brisk recently, and it has been difficult to raise prices. They have been held until now without opening. It is now reported that the guilds from both sides will meet today to jointly evaluate the goods and discuss prices. If they agree, sales will commence. Otherwise, they must telegraph the owners for their consent before a transaction can be made.</p>

<p>The recent arrival of tinplate is not much, and inventories are running low. Moreover, telegrams from overseas report skyrocketing prices. As a result, traders of this commodity are thinking of manipulating the market. The standard market price is rising incessantly, now estimated at $16 (90-pound single-sheet German goods), $17 (90-pound single-sheet American goods), $31.50 (90-pound double-sheet German goods), and $33 (90-pound double-sheet American goods). Both 100-pound single- and double-sheets are up by $1. Transactions are exceptionally strong among manufacturers, and wholesale buyers are also active, so the trend is to corner the market. Moreover, those in the trade with ample capital are also finding ways to hoard, resulting in even less circulating stock, and the market is expected to continue to soar.</p>

<h3 id="e280">On "Don Quixote" and Similar Works <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Zhifang</p>
<p>I heard that someone is about to start translating the complete works of Gorky. This news, at first hearing, is quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Chinese translators, in the past, were mostly peddlers. Although some have rolled up their sleeves to tackle the complete works of a certain foreign author, judging from the few volumes published, some parts were translated so badly that they lost all resemblance to the original. Several major works of Turgenev (not the complete works, of course) have been translated, and some seem to have two versions. Good or bad aside, they were completed. Tolstoy, a name known to anyone with a bit of literary sense, but until now, his "War and Peace" still doesn't have a complete translation! Gogol's "The Inspector General" has been translated, but his greatest work, "Dead Souls," hasn't had the chance to shake hands with these square characters! No wonder Mr. Xu Xia, the translator of "The Nose," said that more civilized countries have translations of it. The youth who are eager for translations complain about this piecemeal policy of the translation world, even more than Mr. Xu Xia.</p>
<p>That’s the first point.</p>
<p>More ludicrous is that some foreign masterpieces have only had their names introduced. Among them, Cervantes' "Don Quixote," though frequently cited by domestic writers in their articles, like a household name like Ah Shi, the book, it seems, still hasn't been translated.</p>
<p>Our translation world once had a flood, but in recent years, translations have been rare, almost silent. However, it is said that the translation world is about to revive. Magazines alone, "Translation" is foremost, followed by "World Literature," which is naturally a welcome phenomenon.</p>
<p>I remember an article I had with Mr. Gu Zhongyi in literature, "My Opinion on Translation." The gist of Mr. Gu's opinion is that those engaged in translation should have an overall plan for translation. Now someone translating the complete works of Gorky and the like can be considered a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>I also have an opinion, but unlike Mr. Gu's overall plan, it is very small. I only hope that translators can translate some works that have been quoted by writers in their works. This is called "paying back the debt," because our authors guide young people to learn by telling them to buy a book like a history of literature in the market, check the representative works of each school and representative author in it to read; some only say in a general way, learn from foreign authors; some pick up a pen and endlessly open a minimum reading list of literature books. However, in a word, the use of each school, each author, each representative work mentioned in the literature history in the market, or the minimum reading list opened, to some learning youth, at most is a demonstration once, there is nothing else.</p>
<p>In modern China, eight or nine out of ten literary youths are not very wealthy. They read some foreign books as difficult as eating swan meat. This refers to those who can speak a foreign language. As for young people who are not from school and have no chance to learn a foreign language but still want to engage in literature, such as shop clerks and workers, when they hear the author's talk or thesis that they must learn from foreign authors but cannot get the translated works of the author, isn't this a basin of cold water pouring on their heads, determining that they have no literary qualifications?</p>
<p>The talk is far away. We are clamoring for a large number of reserve writers, but we do not give them food to eat, or give a little bit of leftovers, snacks, etc., soldiers still have to mutiny, and those who learn literature do not seem to be so wild, but it is inevitable that they will change careers halfway, even if they keep their chastity to the end, and the works they produce are yellow and thin, malnourished!</p>
<p>This is the future crisis, as long as we do not admit that literature is absolutely something that some special people play with in an ivory tower.</p>
<p>Translators may have an overall plan to do it, or choose to start, but don't be like the Shakespeare complete works translation association in Peiping, which has been hanging up for several years, just wish and not repay. Not only that, in addition to repaying the wish, we also want to ask domestic translators to temporarily stop issuing empty checks!</p>
<h3 id="e281">Tokyo Correspondence (Part Two) <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Before entering prison recently, Mr. Lin once said some arrogant words: He called himself a person who turns to persuasion, a guide to repentance, compared to the mentor of Kobayashi Takiji when he overcame opportunism.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the realm of pure art, voices of abuse arose. He cursed the shamelessness and lack of conscience of the converted writers, even comparing them to bandits (magazine) chaos. This righteous indignation indeed attracted attention. However, on the reverse side, Nakamura Takao, who was cursing people as turncoats, himself came from the art school to the path of popular literature (please note that Japanese popular literature is different from Chinese popular literature, Japanese popular literature is the Zhang Henshui style of China). Wen Yuan's dream of pure art, along with his to be completed great work "Life," all stopped together. Not only him, but even Mr. Kikuchi Kan, who attacked Maeda Kōichirō's artistic politics with great arrogance, is also wandering in the garden of popular art.</p>
<p>The conversion of the former, needless to say, is entirely due to the adverse objective environment, which also makes the subjective conditions adverse. The latter's conversion, however, is due to the inevitable material desires of the capitalist era. The manuscript fees for writing popular literature, such as Eiji Yoshikawa, Miki Mikazuki, etc., are around two or three thousand yen per month, while pure art writers probably only get a few tens of yen per month, how far apart! This material temptation inevitably pulls writers who are immersed in urban life into the valley. The poet Saijō Yaso once said, I write a pure art poem at most give me about 30 yuan, if I write a popular song for the gramophone stage, it will be more than a few hundred. For life, I have to write popular songs. This kind of extremely great material temptation is so terrible.</p>
<p>In short, the conversion problem occupies a considerable dispute in today's literary world. They mutually recognize each other, but do not reflect on themselves, and there is no deep thought of re-departure after the conversion, and in the end the problem is more and more chaotic.</p>
<p>The present is indeed the season for revival and popularity. After the disappearance of the voices of classical revival, literary revival, etc., the subjective revival has followed.</p>
<p>Kawabata Yasunari, a leading writer of the pure art school, has recently lamented the weakness of the subjective, the new writer Yadan Qi discusses the improvement of the subjective, and Lin Fangxiong also sings the emphasis on the subjective. The season of the subjective revival has indeed come to the Japanese literary world.</p>
<p>In a time when human life is about to be extinguished under the heavy pressure of the objective, it is certainly not unreasonable to introduce this kind of argument. Under the inability to break the objective heavy pressure, this is the inevitable natural cry, but the problem is how to take the reason of this subjective. For example, Mushanokōji Saneatsu's writing of subjective, is indeed speechless, but in the end, what kind of emphasis and take the reason, to deal with the subjective? The thing that attacks Mushanokōji Saneatsu's subjective is positivism, that is, its objectivity and scientificity, which is indeed a victory in literature. The subjective that we advocate now must be built on the soil of victory. In this way, there is the progressiveness of the subjective. If not, it can produce the ghost of Mushanokōji Saneatsu. This point is indeed the thing that must be paid attention to when Japan is advocating the subjective revival.</p>
<p>Recently, the work that became the problem in the literary world is "Is it a God or a Woman" by Muroo Saisei (Literary Arts, October). This article describes a man who has four concubines and manipulates four women very well. In fact, this thing does not have great advantages, it can only describe the different psychological states of each, and the success of the psychological analysis of the male protagonist Kamahara, but the shortcomings of this article are quite a lot, first. The protagonist is written as someone who has money, and it is of course needless to say that he can buy the hearts and bodies of women with money, and the four people on the other side do not have a strong horse. Furthermore, the male master's need for many women should of course be to suit himself, to yearn for the noble beauty, and to conquer the opposite sex, but in reality, he is written as the man's lust, in the disease and goodness, there is an unintentional decadence of existence. However, although there are the above shortcomings, but in the current time when the works of the pure art school are not prosperous, it is indeed easy to move the attention of all the critics in Japan in October, because there is that sharp psychological analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about an interesting incident. Recently, a certain magazine asked various writers about their second choice, that is, what would they like to be if they did not become literary writers. The most interesting answer was that of Ozaki Shirō, who said: If you allow me to be unreasonable, then perhaps I would be a thief, a pickpocket. Others, such as Rin Tarō Takeda's bourgeois or imperial soldier, Kojiro Serizawa's judicial officer, close to Akai, Wulin Dream Hall, Zhang Xiazhou and other politicians, heroes; new graders painter, etc., are all answered very interestingly.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Autumn in the North <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>Autumn in the north is like a sad erhu.</p>
<p>The erhu is really not something to be loved. Have you ever seen an erhu solo in a concert? As big as a piano, as small as a harmonica, they can all make the dark audience breathe with the rise and fall of the melody; but the erhu's noisy melody has never been loved by the general public. But imagine, if you are in the deserted outside the Great Wall, your heart is as empty as the emptiness of the earth, you want to cry, but you don't know what makes you cry; looking far away, the sand is connected to the sand, the wind is blowing the sand, and the sand is also sending the wind; the sky is too empty, also too lonely, there is one thing less on the earth, and there is one thing less in your heart; this thing is like the incense in front of the mourning hall, like the red cover on the coffin, which can absorb the tears from the bottom of your heart. I say, this thing is the sad erhu. It is like a steel needle, yes, it is a steel needle, stabbing the sky, stabbing the earth, and also stabbing your empty heart. The sound is alive, undulating, it is sad and mournful. The sound is like crying, but not purely sad crying, it is like a hero of the world, in the time of frustration and proof, even if it is helpless, he wants to find a way out of helplessness. Su Wu in the ice and snow probably tasted this taste, but Su Wu still has his flock of sheep to chat with him for comfort. If it is a general of the border, trapped outside the foreign land, in that realm, it is no wonder that he will shed tears. Autumn in the north, will make people feel like this.</p>
<p>Autumn in the north is like a border poem.</p>
<p>Border poems are rich in exoticism, this exoticism contains a sad component, but not the sadness of "bright moon rises from the sea, we share this time of year"; the Tao sadness is magnificent, belongs to the "great wind rises, clouds fly, where can we find brave men to guard the four directions", it is the sigh of "the energy pulls the mountain, the strength covers the world and sighs what to do", it is the "Yi River bank, the autumn wind is bleak. A brave man, waves and crosses". "The wind and dust of the Han Dynasty make the sun dark, and the red flag is half rolled out of the camp door," like these words, does not give you the impression of the Han Dynasty indifferently? In the desert of the border, the wind rolls the dust of the clothes, layer upon layer expanding in the dim sunlight, looking over it is so translucent, like behind thousands of troops, raising a cloud of dust, from the dust faintly you can see the back of the army and horses: and the dim sunlight, shining on the turbid dust and mist, makes the realm more dim and sinking: in the dimness, the more you look at the empty wilderness, this brings some empty taste. Filling this emptiness is also just the empty wind, dust, and dim sunlight, this is really helpless emptiness: this can make people look at the wilderness and very much want to exhale hard. Autumn in the north will give people such a mood.</p>
<p>In the south, it is difficult to have autumn, but that is lingering, like a moonlit night, like a song: it will make people think of the childhood clothes box, in the clothes box is the childhood mother's clothes; compared, the same is autumn, and their distance is just like the north and south in geography. When the grass turns yellow in the south, the autumn plains in the north are already sending dust with the dim sunlight.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Lonely Person <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Mu</p>
<p>Lonely flowers bloomed in the heart of a lonely person. In a very lonely place, I lonely remember:</p>
<p>One very clear morning, the provincial stadium began the rare hustle and bustle of the past: on each row of grandstand benches, accumulated thick dust, people automatically wiped it. That is to say, the crowding of people has not made people care about the opportunity. This was the day after the opening of the provincial sports meeting two years ago, my friend Pan Jun was the selector of the 1500-meter event of this sports meeting. He was only fourteen years old at that time, but he was selected in our school and won the right to participate in this competition.</p>
<p>Naturally, with his age and physical strength, the result was failure, but he reached the end and ran fifth without taking. In the end, he had an unusual record in the newspaper the next day: he was praised as the white-robed young general among the thirty-six heroes.</p>
<p>Like this place! I clearly and intimately remember.</p>
<p>Two years later, I ran to this place again today, and the situation of this place is not different from now: so crowded people, so crowded place, so crowded situation, so crowded... but my friend, died of pneumonia this summer!</p>
<p>Saying that, I was sad. I missed my friend's glorious fragment, and my tears could not help but fall.</p>
<p>"Right here! Right here!"</p>
<p>Saying that, I, this lonely person, ran out again with a gray-white heart.</p>
<p>"Seeds of sorrow!"</p>
<p>This shout was brought down from the tears.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Bells <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3 id="e285">Dou Fang (Seven) <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Wei He</p>
<p>What are you writing!</p>
<p>But I didn't answer him, just gave him a fierce look, and quickly and hastily wrote down. Every time I wrote a word, he would look for it in the book, sometimes he thought he was dazzled and couldn't see it. So he pointed his finger to find it, and asked those gentlemen to see, but they all said it was different from the book. And he also saw that I suddenly wrote so fast and so hastily, it seemed that I was deliberately wasting paper, asking him to lose money, which really surprised and angered him to the point of turning pale.</p>
<p>What exactly are you going to write?</p>
<p>Seeing that I had finished writing "behind vermillion gates, meat and wine stink", and then wanted to write "on the road, corpses of the frozen lie," he couldn't help but get angry.</p>
<p>Who told you, who told you to write like this, beast! He slapped the table and scolded: Does this count as a couplet?</p>
<p>He pulled my ears and hit my head on the table, breaking my nose, and the blood flowed all over the golden and brilliant ten thousand years of red, seeping open piece by piece.</p>
<p>Father was originally weak, but that time when he hit me, he seemed to have a lot of strength, every hit was very effective, so that I couldn't hide it even if I wanted to. Mother came to persuade, but it was useless, as if I had committed a heinous crime, and he looked so brutal that he treated me like an animal.</p>
<p>You want to scrape my face, don't you? You want to collapse my stage, don't you? You beast, I will whip you to death, whip you to death...</p>
<p>I seemed to be spinning in a whirlwind, and I felt pain in all directions. My eyeballs seemed to explode out of my sockets, and I was dark for a while, but then I saw countless sparks stirring. My head was buzzing, and my mind was confused and I couldn't tell the faces of people.</p>
<p>What's wrong, Dad?</p>
<p>I was worthy of myself struggling in pain, just repeating this sentence. The original anger and shame had already formed a lump at that time, like fatigue, pressing heavily on my heart.</p>
<p>Father disregarded everything, just gritted his teeth and hit, sometimes shouting beast, don't you say more. Helpless mother, was also crying next to him. As for those adults and gentlemen, some didn't say a word, standing aside to watch; some pretended to say a few sarcastic remarks, polite and polite; some quietly slipped away; and even more were particularly cheerful to help the old man scold me:</p>
<p>It's reasonable to hit, children are so disobedient, according to their own wishful thinking, hum, it will be terrible in the future! (End)</p>
