<h3>讀考銓會議宣言</h3>
<p>— 季</p>
<p>本月一日。考試院爲謀推動全國公務員之考選銓敘制度。爰有全國考銓會議之召集。開會五日。參與會議者。凡百六十人。其間頗多政學界中知名之士。濟濟一堂。各抒卓見。甚盛事也。昨日報端載有會議閉幕宣言。除撮述諮議决案之概略而外。復鄭重申明。「此次會議。不求立論高遠。但求切實易行。凡所議决。務使一一見之實施。」辭意誠懇。溢於言表。吾人望治心切。因亦樂爲引申其意。</p>
<p>今日世界各國之官吏。皆有政務與事務官之分。二者職務不同。責任逈異。蓋身充政務官者。大抵資望隆重。領袖羣僚。處於舉足輕重之地位。是以常隨民心之向背。而定去留。至於事務官則率經考選而後錄用。復遵照政務官所釐訂之政策而執行日常事務。國家爲確保行政上之系統及效率起見。類有文官保障法令。爲事務官作護身符。俾其安心服務。不隨政潮變動而更易。獨我國今日之事務官則不然。蓋其黜陟升降。大都憑主管長官之好惡而定。又往往視其推薦勢力之强弱而爲比例。於是懷抱眞才者。每至埋没終身。不獲一展其長。而不肖者反得佔據高位。擅作威福。况以人設官。人去政廢。長官之去留。既爲屬員進退之標凖。人人自不免於各存「五日京兆」之心。安肯戮力奉公。潔已自好。趨勢所至。終至日常政務屢易生手。行政系統。頻生破綻。人的問題不解决。縱有任何善制良法。亦將無所用之。可斷言也。此届考銓會議議决案中。有關於公務人員之保障者。殆即有見於斯。誠能與考績辦法。同時實施。則所謂「引用眞才」「圖絶倖進」之目的。庶幾可以同時</p>
<p>我國年來舉行高考普考。已有數次。但在舉行之前。既未爲將來錄取人員一一妥籌安插之地。則在舉行以後。自不能不使錄取人員感覺失望。察其情形。似與一般大學但知製造畢業生而不計其出路者。相去無幾。若此不良現象。實不容其無期延長。今後欲圖改革。非厲行現職公務員之考續辦法。不足以汰劣留良。亦即不能騰出空額。爲安插高考或普考錄取人員之用。此届會議。對於考選方法。頗多籌劃。而於考績一項。亦有規定。推其用意。無非以爲一公務人員之服務成績。不宜悉定於其主管長官之手。而當由中央政府加以考核。藉爲奬懲之依據。庶幾倖進尸位之徒。無法掩飾其短而終至於淘汰。會議宣言主張對於「來自薦牘之公務人員。」「嚴勵執行考績。每年一次。並規定最小限度。淘汰照百分比率。以便澄清仕途。登用考試及格之人才。」堪稱適中時弊。此又一端也。</p>
<p>然上述事務官之保障與考績二端。原則簡單。而難在實行。此其責任。决非考銓機關所能獨負。更非一朝一夕。即可行之有效。甚望考試院以外之其他當局。能悉起而贊助。共襄進行。國家前途。實利賴之。</p>

<h3>美國三千萬人投票民主黨大勝利</h3>
<p>羅斯福表示愉快</p>
<p>共和黨一蹶不振</p>
<p>辛克萊州長落選</p>
<p>［華盛頓］昨日之總選民主黨大勝、共和黨最後陣地亦已崩潰、民主黨之</p>
<p>勝利　一九三二年羅斯福之當選總統不相上下、郵務長及民主黨中央委員會主席法萊昨夜聲稱、有名之共和黨今已瓦解、今晨各地報告已證此言不虚、各州報告雖尚未全到、但民主黨已席捲東海岸以至西海岸之共和黨勢力、法萊所稱民主黨之非常勝利今已證實矣、法萊並稱、羅總統對於民衆信任其政府不勝愉快、但民主黨中特出之候選人仍遭失敗、據最後報告、共和黨候選人摩齡有當選加州長之望、而民主黨候選人辛克萊則已失敗、根據現在不完全之報告、民主黨在參院獲選逾十席、此非民主黨領袖始料所及、因彼等最初祇望多得四席也、更據各地陸續報告、衆院競選、共和黨亦不甚成功云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>［紐約］截至今晨七時爲止、選舉所得結果如下、參議院改選三十二席、民主黨當選十五席、共和黨三席、農工黨一席、進步黨一席、尚有十二席結果未明、衆議院共計議員四百三十五席、民主黨當選二百零八席、共和黨五十二席、農工黨一席、進步黨三席、結果未明者尚有一百七十一席、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［紐約］選舉結果、證明共和黨已遭前所未有之慘敗、據最近報告、衆院各黨議席如下、</p>
<p>民主黨　　　二三四、</p>
<p>共和黨　　　七○、</p>
<p>農工黨　　　一、</p>
<p>進步黨　　　一、</p>

<p>迄今民主黨多獲八席、共和黨多獲三席、各州選舉、民主黨亦獲勝利、已在紐約州議會佔優勢、此爲二十年來之第一次、紐約州長民主黨黨員里曼已獲選聯任、其所獲票數在七八十萬之間、較羅斯福總統昔日獲選該州州長所獲票數猶多、主賑「大海軍」之共和黨黨員白里丹、服務國會已二十二年、此次亦落選、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>［紐約］此次選舉、爲美國南北戰爭以還之最重要者、羅斯福總統之新措施、將因此結果、於今後兩年或不止兩年内受民衆之擁護、共和黨此次一敗塗地、其最足使人驚駭者、爲加州代理州長摩齡已戰勝辛克萊、辛氏自信可操勝劵、但選民多投票擁護共和黨候選員摩齡、於是辛氏乃承認失敗、本塞爾凡尼亞州之參議員李德、實際爲上届國會共和黨之領袖、所獲之票遠落民主黨古斐之後、惟該州州長共和黨候選員施那德已超勝民主黨候選員歐爾、此次兩黨選民投票、曾互相詆責有恫嚇行暴違法登記及破壞選舉法種種行爲、對於警察等亦有責言各處因違法被捕者頗多、本塞爾凡尼亞州尤多、該州因哈士頓曾有四人爲機關槍擊斃、故民情異常激昂、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］全國選舉結果、今夜初更自一部份投票報告觀之、下届國會仍將由民主黨大多數控制無疑、目前多數選區尚在檢票、然以初步報告推測、則參議院中民主黨或尚可增加勢力、即衆議院中共和黨亦未見有何進步、此次選舉因包含問題極多、故民主黨之得失未能即視爲人民對於「新政」之凖確表示、兩日來天氣清朗、人民投票非常踴躍、至截止時爲止、大概四十七洲中共有三千萬人投票、加利福尼亞州因社會主義文學家辛克萊競選州長關係、最受注意、據官方統計、該州投票者約二百萬人、羅斯福總統今日侵晨即赴海特派克投票、總統偕其家屬於大雨傾盆之中、驅車至市政廳、以盡其國民天職、當總統行至登記處時、女監察員叩以姓氏、總統含笑答曰「羅斯福」、女監察員頓覺面紅耳赤、投票人衆乃大呼以謔之、有人詢總統以選舉形勢、總統笑而不答、同日辛克萊亦在加州百沙登那投票、新聞記者追逐不懈、辛克萊即稱、如落選、必即根據加州憲法所規定之複决權及召撤權、運動召撤摩齡州長也、昨日有數處發生暴動、除本雪爾凡尼亞州五人身死外、尚有密蘇里及墾脱啟二州各死一人、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［紐約］羅總統因國會之選舉、已佔勝利、可自由進行其新措施、其期限爲二年或二年以上、此種結果、雖共和黨亦承認之、蓋今日午後來自東方與中西諸州之投票結果、皆擁護民主黨也、民主黨大獲勝利、殆無可疑、今晚衆院原有議員復被選出者、計民主黨六十人、共和黨五人、民主黨預料至少可在參院獲三分二之多數、並保持其在衆院之勢力、今日全國在兩黨互相指摘之混擾中進行選舉、除哈士頓今晨死於機關槍下者之五人外、他處亦有毆鬥致死情事、俄海倭州死一人、西雅圖死一黑人、並有數人受傷、因黑人希圖投票、致被衆毆打也、加州與紐約之投票處、今日有大批警察保護之、以防發生生流血情事、社會主義著作家辛克萊欲得加州州長一席、特組織律師隊五隊、分頭襄助人民爭投票權、因反對黨聲稱、洛杉磯一處有違法登記之選民一萬人、辛克萊與共和黨茂利木皆自信必獲勝利、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］據昨夜選舉結果觀之、下届國會之擁護政府新措施、殆爲已成事實、紐約州長里曼有重被選出之望、而西斐眞利亞州瑪麗蘭州紐約州民主黨已佔優勢、喬治亞州密西西壁州、及南方諸州所有民主黨議員、皆被選出、芝加哥黑人候選議員二人、互相競爭、共和黨黑人勢力稍遜、民主黨在參議院定可將其席數增至三分之二、因向來著名共和黨根據地今已漸爲民主黨所奪有也、衆議院議員已被舉出者、計民主黨一一七人、共和黨一二人、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>英日昨舉行四次會商</p>
<p>［倫敦］各方面皆認今日海軍談話、將爲一種危迫性質者、英總代表西門外相將提出方法、而使美代表入場、俾談話得依三方面之基礎重行開始、英日代表現方忙碌從事會談、而美代表則並無約會、惟殷待英日會議之結果、美代表之意、此會結果與談話前途之全局將大有關係、衆料第二步驟將爲英美代表明日之會談、</p>
<p>英日代表今日午後四時起、在下院續開海軍談話、至少將歷一小時之久、美代表團中之阿塞頓今晨曾爲海軍談話事、至英外交部作機密討論、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］海軍談話中、日本代表團對於各項提議、凡不包括日本實行獲得平等權者、一律加以反對、因此英國方面似欲提出一種調和之新方案、俾易爲日本方面所接受、英國代表團擬按照日本駐美大使齋藤返、華盛頓原任、時所發表之提議、與日本以逐步達到海軍對等之權利、此項辦法提出以後、倘日本政府代表全部加以拒絶、或拒絶其實施之方式、則英國代表團擬另作退步辦法、聞英國考慮一種辦法廢除海軍軍力之量的限制、但仍維持質的限制、換言之、即英美日三大海軍國可自由建造各類艦艇、其數目並無限制、惟每類艦艇之噸數及其砲徑大小、則須遵守嚴格之限制、本日午後英國代表團、全體人員將與日本代表團會議、大約上述英國第一種提議、至少當在本日會議中提出云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英美代表會談爲日本啟門路</h3>
<p>美表示願依新基礎</p>
<p>賡續談話使日就範</p>
<p>［倫敦］海軍談話經英國作外交上之努力後、英美日三國代表全體將於本週内繼續進行、今日午後英外相西門在外交部延見美總代表台維斯、會談一小時十五分之久、兩人多就英美之觀察點研究現局、西門曾提出繼續談話之方案、並切實聲明英政府願見各方獲得諒解、俾一九三五年之大會得以召集、而略具成功希望、台維斯聲稱、美代表團不願於未研究各種可能的意見時、終止此次會議、美代表團願聆日政府所欲提議之一切、同時渠之意見、以爲如欲維持倫敦討論之存在、手續問題甚覺困難、台維斯又告西門、美代表團凖備依西門意中所有之新基礎繼續談話云、台維斯既作此保證、於是遂公布三國代表團全體本週中將續開談話會消息、而先由英日代表團集議云、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國挽救僵局尋求調解方式</h3>
<p>將建議稍修正比率</p>
<p>美日意見依然懸隔</p>
<p>［倫敦］一般人預料海會初步談判行將重開、並以爲英國方面將於日美之間、尋覓調解方式、此種印象、係在今日下午外相西門與美代表台維斯會晤之後發生者、如取得日本之贊成、則明日或將召集英日美三方會議、但初步談判之重開、並不能認爲局勢之有進展、亦不能視爲各方意見之接近、國日美兩方仍堅持本國之主張也、重開談判時、究竟以何爲基礎殊不可知、據英國政界所言、英國代表團於下次開會時、僅將重行申述英國業已提出之調和建議、而主張在現行之五·五·三比率、與日本所要求之海軍平等之間、求一折衷辦法、易詞言之、即採取與五·五·四相近之比率是也、此種辦法、不過就衆人業已知曉之基礎、重行努力而已、蓋五·五·四比率之建議、不自今日始也、但此項比率、日美兩國均不歡迎、至於華盛頓條約之廢止、英美代表團所重者、在於確知日本宣告廢止之日期、而不在加以阻止、昨日國聯會委任統治委員會、由審查日本統治太平洋各島報告書而發現之事實、在英國人眼光視之、事實上日本業已違反國聯盟約、（按照國聯盟約第二十二條、在委在統治地不得設置軍備）、惟一般輿論、以爲在國聯會討論日本在太平洋各島違反國聯盟約問題之前、日本必已先行正式宣佈廢止華盛頓條約矣、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>倫敦泰晤士報暢論海軍形勢</h3>
<p>談判决裂足招競爭</p>
<p>英美絶少衝突可能</p>
<p>［倫敦］際兹海軍會議預備談話又將重開之時、泰晤士報發表社論、謂華盛頓海約已成陳跡、亟須設法代以限制海軍之新條約、其言曰、「此間海軍談話、目的係爲來年海軍會議樹立基礎、俾有成立新恊定之可能、此際即使僅能填平地面、以便他日開始建築、在世界視之、亦未必定有所損、若以英國而論、其唯一主要觀點、即海軍談話縱然破裂、其影響所及、將使美國現有之造艦計畫、其規模已甚宏大者益加擴大、英國方面亦不致爲所驚擾、而以鎮靜處之、則以英美兩國海軍决無發生衝突之可能、即在世界文明之末日、亦不作兵戎相見之想也、更有進者、英美兩國形勢固屬如是、即大不列顛帝國各自治領如加拿大·澳洲·均位於太平洋濱、對於太平洋均勢之維持、與夫海軍問題之滿意解决、其關懷之切、或且駕母國而上之、其與美國日益擴大之海軍發生衝突、更較母國尤少可能、自可不言而喻、凡此云云、自屬實在情形、但若就此而謂英美兩國即將成立或願成立聯合陣綫以對付日本、則絶非眞相、緣英國對於日本之同情心理與友好交誼、相沿已久、迄今未有變更、而日本不欲居於劣等地位、其願望亦深爲英國人士所了解也、惟是海軍競爭足以招致破産、此在日本、其影響尤爲惡劣、然則英日美三最大海軍國務當恊力避免之、無論如何、終必維持質的限制、換言之、即關於軍艦噸數·砲位口徑大小之競爭·能有以避免之、非然者、任何國家務欲建造較大之海軍、較重之軍艦、其結果必致財政全部爲之破産、又安可掉以輕心、抑華府海約關於各國在太平洋島嶼中舉辦防禦工事、及其對華政策、均載有重要之規定、其所根據之原則、即「安全平等」與「中國領土完整」、是即目今談話中所未可撇開之原則、今若於覓獲相當代替品之前、而以推翻此項原則爲能事、其責任之大、恐非任何人所能担負也」云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日黷武國積極建造秘密艦隊</h3>
<p>美海軍界透露消息</p>
<p>日本又一新艦完工</p>
<p>［華盛頓］紐約泰晤士報載稱、美國海軍界人士確信日本曾建造海軍秘密艦隊、其中有煤油艦六艘、速率每小時十八海里、此項艦艇與眞正之補助巡洋艦無異、均係秘密建造、未在勞德登記所記登、因此日本現有全世界最新式之運送艦三十四艘、此項運送艦均可改造爲巡洋艦、其中二十一艘、最低速度二十一海里、至於美國運送艦則速率未有達十五海里者、美國海軍中若干軍官、均期望此一問題可在倫敦提出討論云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［東京］曾於昭和八年十二月以來、在横須賀海軍工廠建造之最新式二等巡洋艦鈴谷號（八千五百噸）速力三十三諾特）漸告完成、訂於二十日舉行進水典禮、（七日日聯電）</p>
<h3>樸資茅斯附近英籌築飛機場</h3>
<p>防空上佔險要地位</p>
<p>［倫敦］消息靈通方面頃徵實「每日民聲報」所載英國政府建築廣大飛機場之消息、據該報載稱、英國政府擬在樸資茅斯港附近之桑奈島上、建築一大規模之飛機場、蓋以該地在英國防空綫上佔險要之地位也、政府現正進行購買該飛機場基地之談判、該航空根據地建築完成後、將裝置最完備之防空器械、其目的則在保護停泊樸資茅斯港内之艦隊云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>死光槍試騐成功</h3>
<p>射光强烈中人如酒醉</p>
<p>力能使飛機失駕駛力</p>
<p>法工程師之新發明</p>
<p>［巴黎］死光槍發明人特告美聯社記者、稱若干國現正競購死光槍之製造秘法、該光能使航空員墮地、法國工程假克列馬斯稱、「此項發明今已脱離實騐時期、吾儕之試騐、初以形如平槍之縮型、發射死光今已告成功、法國軍事當局現正助吾人擴大此項原則、並在占爾堡都隆及伊勒斯脱等要塞以特别設備、供吾應用、外國代表雖迭與吾人談判、但吾人不得法政府之允許、不願出售也」云、克列馬斯繼稱、彼與其弟及一奧國工程師名里爾好施者經過二年之試騐、始完成今日之發明、死光槍並不殺人、不過使人暫時失去知覺、人中死光如酒醉而已、使航空員失去駕機能力而已、該光係取自美國或德國所産之一種金質物、此種金屬所發之光極强、較錳所發之光强過數倍、此光可以延長至八秒或十二秒鐘不散、如欲再事延長、則爲事實所不許、因高度之熱、足以融化發射之槍管也云、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>全國休假三日</p>
<p>［莫斯科］莫斯科蘇維埃特於今夜在大歌劇院舉行大會、慶祝十月革命十七週紀念、共黨中央機關蘇聯政府及職工會均參加會議、斯太林、莫洛托夫、伏洛希羅夫、加昂諾維契、加里甯及共黨中央委員會與政府委員坐主席台上、並由蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里甯致辭、</p>

<p>各報詳載蘇聯在政治文化及經濟方面之成就、伊斯維斯太報稱、「社會主義之基礎已極堅定而結實、任何反革命之污水不能加以摇撼、同時任何帝國主義之大砲俱不能轟燬之、因吾國已澈底改造、同時全國大規模之工廠、集體農場、機械化之礦場、乃至飛機、潛艇、北冰洋站及大無畏之海軍中、隨處隨時、均有吾新起之國民爲之守衛、此等國民均已深受訓練、彼等必能向其階級敵及其盲目之自然力量鬥爭也、勞苦大衆正開人類歷史之新紀錄、獲得其眞正而非幻想之自由、爲自身之福利而工作、而創造、同時逐漸産生此種物質條件、以完成澈底而普遍之幸福、此項鬥爭實極艱苦、唯世間任何力量不能停止其前進、因人類發展之法則已規定無産階級之普遍勝利爲不可避免也、」該報復論蘇聯國防云、「舉世已知紅軍爲今世最佳之軍隊、紅軍之軍備乃吾國工業所完成之高度效率之成果、紅軍組織之優良復係蘇聯無産階級及其黨所有特異的組織力量與技巧之成果、紅軍官兵軍事訓練之優越乃爲偉大文化力量之成果、而此種力量乃由十月革命自蘇聯工農羣衆中引起者、紅軍之英勇精神復爲多數黨以其社會主義工業化與集體化之政策、激起蘇聯工人及集體農民戰鬥精神後之結果、至於紅軍士兵之團結一致、亦即無産階級獨裁擊碎一切國内階級敵人之産物也、」該報續稱、「軍縮會議之失敗、以及現方進行中之軍備競爭、均足表示新的世界帝國主義戰爭、已在目前、法西冒險分子力圖將戰爭狂潮、撥向蘇聯、唯其形成反蘇聯聯合陣綫並令蘇聯孤立之希望、已成泡影、帝國主義列强内部之矛盾實極深刻、故任何目光遠大之人士必能了解此項眞理、即戰爭之爆發不論其在何處、其將變成世界戰爭、已無疑義、若夫蘇維埃之巨人則於衝擊其灘岸之浪潮恒付以鎮靜與精警之注視、彼已洞知其實力之巨大、且能對付並澈底擊破其敵人而有餘、彼復了解、彼之實力愈强、則於爭取和平與自衛之奮鬥中、必能獲得更多之友人、彼不需戰爭以完成其自身之目的、故其所厲行者乃爲堅定之和平政策、同時對於不好戰爭之國家定能携手援助」云、（六日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>法急社黨拒絶妥恊杜邁格内閣瀕瓦解</h3>
<p>閣員五人已提出辭呈</p>
<p>預算案决難通過國會</p>
<p>［巴黎］據政界觀察者之意、總理杜邁格與急進社會黨之衝突、已無轉環餘地、而必將於星期四行政會議中破裂、據晨報戲稱、昨日行政會議席上形勢急轉、赫理歐曾對總理云、彼及其他急進黨閣員决難贊同總理提案、總理即答云、若然則不贊成者應退出現閣、一時形勢上遂告緊張、赫氏即質問總理是否將彼等開革、旋經總統勒白崙氏排解而和緩、會議因無結果而散、急進黨議員昨復通過决議拒絶總理之預算案、形勢遂又將嚴重、目下能繼杜邁格組新政府者以現任外長賴伐爾氏爲最有望、外間皆慮再演本年二月間之騷亂、警務當局因已特别戒備、以防萬一云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］法政府明日之被推倒、衆皆視爲已可確定、據彙聞報與每日郵報巴黎訪員電稱、明日法政府如倒、法國必發生嚴重之平民示威運動、急進社會黨閣員五人已向法總統提出辭職呈、總統謂彼等之辭職、非至明日不能視爲有效、法内閣之分裂、因總理杜邁格要求國會討論籌欵案促成、衆院已定明日開會辯論該案、急進社會黨反對此案甚力、故料必予否决、於是總理杜邁格不得不辭職引退、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］衆院今日開會、杜邁格内閣已有必倒之勢、美聯社訪員遍向議員訪問、據悉急進社會黨議員大半將於總理提出預算及憲法改革案時投票反對、苟無意外之事發生、則杜邁格如仍堅持將每月預算案及憲法修改案同時提出、使人贊成前者即不得不贊成後者、其失敗已成必然之勢、急進社會黨閣員六人、今夜已向總理提出辭呈、一俟總理提出改革案、彼等即實行去職、此事亦可視爲政府在衆院中將得何種結果之預兆、今夜提出辭呈者爲</p>

<h3>急社黨團開會</h3>
<p>决定維持休戰原則</p>
<p>對總理提折忠方法</p>
<p>［巴黎］衆議院急進社會黨黨團、本日開會、選舉黨團主席、（原任主席前總理旭當現已改入參議院、）外間對於會議極形重視、關於黨團主席之繼任人選、原以前總理達拉第最有希望、惟達氏現已宣稱渠决不提出候選資格、不但目前如此、即一星期後亦然云云、黨國嗣乃决定延期選舉主席、外間解釋延期一事、以爲赫禮歐一旦恢復自由行動、（指脱離内閣）或願從新主持黨團、故特預留地步云、赫氏及急進社會黨各閣員本日出席會議、赫氏對於杜邁格總理憲政改革案、及臨時預算案提出説明、謂兩案現尚未向衆院秘書處提出、惟渠爲使黨團洞知政府意向以便討論起見、特先加以説明、查最近本黨在朗特城舉行大會、對於總統解散衆院之權利一節、贊成維持現狀、赫氏又主張渠及各閣員暫時退出會場、俾不妨礙黨團之討論及其决定云、此議未爲黨團所接受、嗣由内長馬尚　説明政　一旦爆發、則在目前情形之下、　陰殊　、渠意憲法改革係屬善舉、憲法會議　　之後、當能制定憲法修正條文之詞句、務求足以權威畀予政府、而使其地位趨於穩定也云云、繼由衆院財政委員會主席瑪爾維申請各議員採取妥恊態度、至是黨團乃舉行長時間討論、急進黨各閣員亦同時參加、結果通過動議案、藉以説明（一）急進黨維持政黨休戰内閣、並要求其他各政黨同樣行動、（二）迅速表决一九三五年預算案、而對臨時預算案加以保留、希望杜邁格總理加以接受、（三）憲政改革案可爲黨團所接受、惟對於無須徵求參院同意而解散衆院之權利、則提出保留云、投票贊成動議案者幾達全數、黨團散會時、已晚間七時餘矣、</p>
<p>［巴黎］今晚急進黨開會通過維持政黨休戰之决議案、政府乃得因以暫獲安全、但杜邁格之辭職、恐終不能免也、急進黨表示願總理儘速以豫算案付表决、而弗再斤斤要求籌欵、乃派不管部閣員赫禮歐謁社、請接受此種折衷方法、惟據消息靈通方面推料、總理必拒絶接受、衆院已定期星期四日開始辯論籌欵問題、届時政府如不傾覆者、則必有神力護佑也、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>憲政改革計畫參院通過反對動議</h3>
<p>［巴黎］急進黨反對總理之改革計畫及其他方案之態度、可於今日參院會議情形徵之、參院議員以九六對二票通過動議、聲明剥奪日前參院關於解散衆院之特權、實屬危險云、按參院議員急進黨佔多數、今既反對杜邁格之憲政改革、則他日國會召集以批准總理此案時、勢必引起風潮也、按總理改革憲政案已由内閣多數贊同、其中要點爲（一）限制閣員人數爲二十人、連總理在内、（二）總統得依下律解散衆院、（甲）成立之第一年内須需參院之同意、始能解散之、（乙）第一年後不必獲參院之同意、（三）保障公務員之職位、以免强被革除、當時急進黨閣員對解散衆院問題、曾聲明保留其態度、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］除急進社會黨黨團以外、衆議院左派　　黨、人民民主黨·及左派共和黨各黨團皆一致向杜邁格總理表示信任、惟共和民主黨議員反對臨時預算案、認爲無益、至於　左之社會黨及共産黨、則對於杜邁格憲政改革案、認爲「汎繫主義之　　」　表仇視、自屬當然、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>杜邁格辭職不免繼任組閣人選推測</h3>

<p>［巴黎］聞國會急進黨議員今日午後集議後、赫禮歐與其他急進黨閣員均將提出辭職呈、如果出此、則赫禮歐與海軍部長畢特里公共工程部長佛蘭亭等將組織内閣、新閣人物、將與現閣同、特無杜邁格耳、總理所請籌欵議案、請在一九三五年第一季内籌佛郎一三·六二八·○○○枚、因其根據减少官俸與養老金命令之預算、尚未及提出國會故也、（七日路透）</p>
<h3>法國會開會第一日情形</h3>

<h3>法國閣潮影響金融市場</h3>
<p>［倫敦］法國杜邁格内閣有傾覆之勞、故今日歐陸復起恐慌、巴黎購進英鎊與美元、幸美國運用其匯兑平凖金、大購佛郎、以期阻止美元之過份　貴、致黄金源源運入紐約、否則佛郎將愈疲弱、法國閣潮現令人惶慮、惟恐今年二月六日巴黎所發生之暴動、復見於將來、而薩爾公民投票大會事、亦爲使人不甯之原因、此間人士以爲時局現需有强固政府、顧在目前、此種强固政府似不易得、比國能否保持其金本位尚屬可疑、其三個月之票據、現貼現四十二生丁、因上述種種情形、金錢流入倫敦者乃愈多、銀行將債欵最低利率减至千分之五之舉動、現引起證劵交易所等處之謡言、以爲英倫銀行之貼現利率將减至百分之一·五、雖此種利率爲英國銀行始終所未有、惟現有利率確嫌過高、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>過玉門而抵安西</p>
<p>從赤金堡西行十五六里、過赤金河、水自南山來、細沙夾流、作絳紅色、五里赤金峽、居民散居、約三十餘家、問以此地産金否、答稱昔傳河中産金沙、今則無人淘取、南去祁連山中、年往淘金者頗衆云、後經戈壁、長六七十里、直至將抵玉門縣城時、始漸見村樹、城周僅三里許、入南門、額曰阨阻羣番、旋轉道斜出北門、城内民房輻輳、街道短狹、中有老楊數株、過心在五尺外、兩旁屋牆、被擠若將崩塌、傳爲年羹堯西征時所植、蓋近三百年之古物也、縣府門庭、望之僅若商舖、男女衣着、尚少破爛、不着衣褲之兒女、亦未見之、而婦女體態、亦頗多健秀者、此因一則同治兵亂、隴西各城焚燬殆盡、此獨幸存、二則林木密茂、水渠通暢、近郊土地、不少膏腴、所謂戈壁中之精華、始獲有此佳象、古詩有關「羗笛無須怨楊柳、春颼不度玉門關」、（按古玉門關、尚在敦煌西北一百二十里）、今人又稱「出了嘉峪關、母猪當貂蟬」、以目前事實證之、皆不確之詩話也、</p>
<p>出城數里、又見戈壁、長則四五十里、始抵大村曰三道溝、屬安西縣、居民三百數十家、漢回最多、近由新疆徙來之纏頭、祇二三家、商號雜陳包頭及新疆之來貨、買賣尚屬可觀、繼在安西城中、亦遠不如之、有種礦産、曰漢水石、自長馬山運來、用煤燒之、驟作雪白色細如粉屑、可提顔料、居民僅以之作彌縫罅隙、堊墻抿壁之用良可惜也、尖時遇由迪化歸來之二人、一周姓、湖南人、帶有家眷二口、一楊姓、山海關人、均謂赴新道途、備感困難、昔年宿站、多被折燬、往往遠行數百里、欲覓一宿食而不得、由哈密至古城子一段、更被馬仲英蹂躪不堪、商旅經過、若不戒備結隊而行、鮮有不被哈薩（亦新疆土著之一種、略與纏頭相似、惟較野蠻）、襲擊者、蓋哈薩之來也、先伺機草澤中、砰然發槍、旋即蜂擁搶殺、所發槍彈、非鋼子乃錫丸、自謂一丸中兔、剥皮賣價、不過值銀二角、若易以擊人、無論如何、所得當在一兔皮之上也云云、</p>
<p>尖後繼續西進、沿途水草豐美、土質輕鬆、而烟村寥落、荒廢良爲可惜、甘新唯一交通之大道、亦爲青草蔓延、僅馬足踏處、輪緣滚處、稍留痕跡、適成一川字形、若併此而無之、則來往路人、一無標誌、必爲蔓草荒漠、迷失途徑矣、二十餘里、過一淺河、晚霞返照、景色宜人、颷然一風、大地旋爲夜色所籠罩、不能趕往前站、因就古廟寄宿、自惠回堡抵玉門、計長五十一公里、約合一百五十三里、又自玉門至此、即在六道溝近處之古廟、計長二十一公里、約合六十三里、共計七十二公里、二百一十六里、</p>
<p>古廟周圍、遍生紅柳、（枝葉似刺柏、而較細、開穗形紅花、南人呼爲觀音柳、西人見之、咸穗形紅花、南人呼爲觀音柳、西人見之、咸稱美觀）、中有白楊二株、一則主幹直抽、高三四丈、一則肥葉密枝、蓬然如傘蓋、對立廟前、遠在數十里外、皆可見之、叩門無應、僅於門縫中可窺正殿佛燈半明半滅、車初至時、隱約見人、翩翩遠奔、料爲廟中住持、誤會而逃、維時細雨霏霏、風沙迅烈、勢難露宿、乃斬鎖而入、廟廊漏角、除有破絮盌缶數具外、餘即空洞無物、推開正殿之門、以手電燭佛像、初見周倉手握大刀、知爲關帝廟、樑椽匾額間、滿棲野鴿、拍拍驚飛、數達百餘頭、旋落庭樹、枝壓而垂、燒飯司務、摩捉數頭、掌燈甫欲烹殺、又念恐遭神譴、因復縱之、明早遇一牧者、謂鴿爲多年老物、果欲烹食、亦難下嚥、去時汽車經理譚君、見廟主尚未返、特另用一新鎖、鎖住廟門、並贈牧者空洋桶一隻、囑將該新鎖之鑰匙、轉交廟主、足見外人做事、不以細小欺人、然亦留再行經過不至被下逐客令之餘地也、</p>
<p>晨行草地、過七道溝腰站、昔年可供宿食、今僅敗垣頽牆、古楊迎風作聲而已、約五十里、抵布隆吉城、沿途多見水灘豐草、最宜墾牧、間遇險地、然亦有水有草、墾種糧食要可無害、布隆吉城周六里許、清雍正時、曾屯田養兵、今安西駐軍亦闢馬場於此、有白楊十餘株、高枝蔽日、濃陰匝地、粗約四五抱、上懸編號布牌、書曰、年大將軍手植、居民原有七八百户、今僅殘餘十分之一、農商負擔日增、逃户時有所聞、蓋皆不勝捐税之剥削、其不逃亡者、亦十室九空、凋敝已極、嘗見賣瓜菓針線之小販、就地設肆、婦人孩童各執烟漿、易食杏菓、睹此情狀、不禁爲鄉民悲也、</p>
<p>午後續行、三十餘里、過窟隆河、即古胡盧水、有古城、唐玉門關故址也、稍西爲雙塔堡、即唐瓜州晉昌縣故址、然亦居民寥寥、頗呈荒凉之象、過堡後坡行約十里、南北兩山左右對峙、北山一墩高聳、南山雙塔凌霄、壯勢天成、不知創自何代、其地河水灣環草木豐盛、俄而亂山起伏、北支又復豁然遠展、車道即沿南山北麓、坦行三十餘里、抵小灣子而宿、是日計行三十八公里、約合一百一十四里、</p>
<p>小灣子水豐土沃、農户向日甚多、今因捐欵繁重、亦多棄耕而逃、今春有一王姓中户、携眷圖逃、村長恐加重未逃者之負擔、將彼追回、王云無種籽耕牛、村長原爲大户、慨然借之、勉强撐持至秋、又復星夜潛逃、既未穫麥、且棄家具、出人不意、故未追及、所棄屋宇、完整可居、門户雖已洞開、但内部所設土灶·大瓶·桌凳、以及預爲老人製好之棺木等、均屬金甌無恙、惟所臥土坑、已被鄰人破作肥料矣、（土坑因上有人臥、下爲糞草之燒薰、經年一換、可充肥料）、夜臥平地、突爲喧聲所驚覺、詢乃張文瑞·及燒飯大司務等、因臥地稍低、夜半渠水汜濫、被褥盡被浸濕、張等白晝辛苦、擁被鼾臥、直至全身濕冷、始醒而亂呼、並稱「被褥重若千斤、無力拖移」云云、嗣即燃火取煖、天明即行、七十里到達安西、正苦無店可宿、邂逅友人范遠岑、現任安西特税局長、堅邀下榻局内、局設四川會館、整潔寛適、絶塞得此、誠幸事也、</p>

<p>（一）整理地方合法税捐、爲本會重要使命之一、現正依據調查各省市税捐情形、作成各種整理計劃、並對於各省市咨報之各項税捐章則、加以縝密之審核、俾擬定將來地方捐税之種類範圍、以期荷雜悉除、而收統一税制之效、</p>

<p>公路成績</p>
<p>陝省建設之最要者、首爲公路、蓋以交進阻隔、地方閉塞、一切建設、即難進行、現由省方主辦者、有咸榆路及鳳隴路、前者由咸陽北至綏邊之榆林、貫通全省、長凡五百餘公路、後者由鳳翔至甘邊之隴縣、長百三十餘公里、兩路均於兩月前開工、正建築中、另由自漢中至北河之公路、長亦五百餘公里、係奉蔣委員長命興建、已由中央撥欵九十萬餘元爲經費、即將開工、</p>
<p>西安市政</p>
<p>西安市政、亦正積極進行、市内重要道路、已完成三條、現更將原有之士路、加以改建、預定於明春二月以前、將市内各重要通衢、均改爲石路、省府且經决定創設西安電氣有限公司、由官商各出資二十五萬元爲資本、已成立籌備委員會、派建廳主任秘書、會同紳商三人組織、雷氏此次南來、並偕電氣專家同來、將向全國建設委員會、商購舊有首都電廠電機、俟在滬公畢、即晉京接洽、該機可供電七百五十啟羅瓦特、足供該市之用、</p>
<p>水利建設</p>
<p>雷氏又談、陝省水利建設、頗關重要、自省當局與全國經濟委員會詳擬辦法、逐步進行以來、已有涇惠洛惠兩渠完工、灌田在百萬畝以上、省府則按田徵收水利捐、並决將此項捐税、專作水利建設之用、俾水利建設、可以獨立、而逐步進行、則陝省最感困難之旱荒、可以避免云、</p>

<p>冀鄂贛三省之修堤工程　民十四夏、本會工程股、精心籌築漢口上游之石首堤、使久經荒廢之田、一變而爲熟田、每年可獲二百萬元之收入、計用去工費約十萬元之譜、另由當地捐作士工、稍資補助、此項堤工、蓋有石面、極形堅固、足爲本會工程之紀念、民十六年間、本會對於湖北防訊工程、約有計畫二十種、費欵達一百六十萬元、半由本會資助、半由地方供給、是年春、並修築漢口相近之張公堤之緊急工程、費欵達十六萬元、民十四年、本會在贛河與鄱陽湖間、修理已毁之渠堤甚多、此項工程、用洋二十萬元、而收穫則十倍此數、實可恢復原有二千萬元之地價、民十四十五年間、本會在河北省、籌辦堤工、用洋四十萬元、除本會工程人員外、並無其他機關、分任此項工作、在保定東三十英里西淀之長堤、與逶與地方之千里堤、皆爲本會工程股妥爲修理、次年該處農田之收成、即在西淀一處、已可值價五百萬元之鉅、總計本會在此十二年間、共完成之堤工、有九百零四英里、（未完）</p>

<h3>華人選手大不景氣硬地網球迭出冷門</h3>
<p>單打邱飛海敗於王文正</p>
<p>林寶華又棄權於卡爾生</p>
<p>雙打林鄭亦爲德卡所敗</p>
<p>法商總會主辦之第二十二届上海硬地網球錦標賽、自上月二十七日開賽以來、和項錦標、均將結束、皆入决賽時期、現定本星期六日兩日舉行决賽、男子單打中、半複賽中、邱飛海昨竟以二對零敗於王文正、大出意料之外、而林寶華之棄權於卡爾生、與鄭兆佳之棄權於史班列蒂、尤爲令人掃興之至、現將由卡爾生王文正决賽錦標、至於雙打最有希望之林寶華鄭兆佳組、昨在複賽中、亦爲德孚卡爾生所敗、亦非始料所及也、</p>
<p>邱飛海敗於王文正</p>
<p>邱飛海王文正之半複賽、邱竟以二對零慘敗、六比一、八比六、上場王以猛烈之發球與抽擊、加以上網壓殺、使邱無所措手、束手待縛、以六比一慘敗、第二盤邱力加振作、局勢驟形緊張、各五各六、卒爲王連加二局得勝、王在優游杯中、擊敗楊寶華、今又勝老邱、大非易事也、</p>
<p>林鄭雙打敗於德卡</p>
<p>林寶華鄭兆佳對德孚卡爾生之雙打、三時三刻才開賽、德卡兩人、發球俱凶猛無比、林鄭相形見拙、加以兩人能隨處殺球、使林鄭毫無辦法、回殺之球、則力不足、時見被卡德擊回、第一盤、由四比二而六比三、德孚之表演、卓絶一時、推四人之冠、第二盤德卡减色、要鄭得於一比三後、連勝五局、最後一盤、林鄭又以六比二失敗、鄭兆佳錯誤甚多、殊令人失望也、</p>
<p>男子單打</p>
<p>複賽　卡爾生勝林寶華　棄權</p>
<p>王文正勝史班蒂　六比一、六比一、</p>
<p>半複賽　卡爾生勝張定釗　六比二、六比四、</p>

<p>莫爾夫人勝柯拉沙小姐、六比三、七比五、</p>
<p>女子雙打</p>
<p>本星期六尚須舉行複賽、全屬外國女子、從略、</p>
<h3>慈善賽華聯和聖芳濟</h3>
<p>華聯先以一比四見拙於人</p>
<p>最後一刻鐘造成各四各局</p>
<p>昨日天氣暗寒、狗場積水已乾、可供馳騁之用、預定之慈善賽乃得如期舉行、雖非休沐之日、但排暇往觀者、亦得三千餘衆、華聯前鋒論個人技藝、均屬第一流好手、唯合作太差、短傳尤少、故失機屢屢、節節處於敵人下風、在下半時十五分鐘時、曾以四對一見拙於人、幸在最後、刻鐘内、收復失地、造成和局、李甯爲防空網上唯一功臣、所救險球何　兩打、鍾勇森偷寒送暖、彌覺可人、亨哥失之大意、失乎之球頗不在少、其他諸將平平而已、</p>
<p>風聲鶴淚連陷三關</p>
<p>聖芳濟人馬駐紥東郊、鮑休脱興師西下、義臣邀住反攻、麥山兒返駕不易、秋亭小試牛刀、高高飛去、孫鐵腿再度問津、天台路遠、鎮祥約同梁陳兩將、闖過中綫、冷不防後方空虚、敵五鋒大軍來犯、稍一盤旋、小將福恩得球斜射、先告得手、華聯勇攻不已、孫鐵腿當門一砲、不幸爲門柱彈回、勇森再以美妙之貢獻、曹孫互讓而失機、老孫未幾又來、得機急射、掠門綫而過、眞乃天數、福恩盤進、内防阿關馬失前蹄、砰然苦中、從右上角飛入華門、老孫東下孤軍深入、滿擬此行得手、詎爲唐守將小腿擋駕、命也如何、不旋踵、福恩又到危險地位、舉足射門、亨哥所立地位不正、竟將球拍入網中、連負三球、</p>
<p>士有死志攻下危城</p>
<p>三城連陷、將士無顔、四座球迷同聲呐喊、陳洪光在中衛綫大展身手、不住價輸送軍火糧餉、李義臣拔步飛奔、雷米迪跌得天昏地黑、毛腿一起、凖而急、觀衆正擬報彩、却不料偏之五寸、未能奏功、曹秋亭滿懷怒火、帶球直下、趕到低綫、傳入中路、老孫正待上前、麥山兒半途攔阻、動彈不得、海光伏軍突起、迎頭一頂、遂破湯團紀錄、美技可喜、此後攻守未久、休息時至、</p>
<p>門將失職敵又猖狂</p>
<p>再戰聲中、敵五鋒仗其靈活流利之盤球、疊次予我以强烈之攻擊、李甯不愧爲中華虎將、長遞短傳、鞠躬盡悴、鮑休脱見勢不諧、乃暗傳號令、向右路進襲、柯拉立沙派一高球、至門前落下、徐亨搶出一拍、球未遠去、而徐氏脚長腿快、已超出防这地範圍、阿爾傑睹此良機、飛奔而至、横身一潑、宣告得手、看客不禁扼腕嘆息、預料華聯命運多舛、永無反勝之機會、</p>
<p>原璧歸趙皆大歡喜</p>
<p>唯白雲蒼狗、變幻無常、華聯隊蓄志報仇已久、雖處在四面楚歌之下、絶不因此灰心、勇森兩度深入腹地、皆以孤軍無後、廢然而返、義臣跌倒派球、小曹足下擺渡、鍾君趕到送入網底、成四對二、洪光長傳一脚、義臣頭頂、兩記脚踢、一記神速無比、奪得一城、此時華軍氣燄萬丈、灸手可熱、大鍾智勇雙全、質煞夫維克透雖防之似賊、有時亦賊入家門、麥山兒懊不該以手揩油出毛病、十二碼判定、孫鐵腿輕輕一掃、造成秋色平分、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求寒工護老　萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>志前笑道：你這位老人家，也太客氣了。於是在他手上，將瓦碗要了過來，立刻我了一張乾净紙，將瓦碗擦着，也不待老工人再説什麽，將餅乾倒在碗裏，把碗遞回給他，笑道：你不要吃甜的嗎？這餅乾就很甜。老工人接着碗同他笑道：你老這樣好意，我倒不好不要，帶回去給我們女孩子了。説着，兩手捧了碗，作了兩個揖。志前笑道：你太客氣了，倒呌我不好意思。那老工人無話可説，望着他笑笑，自去了。這時，有個茶房進房去。志前想到西關的水好，住家的人，當然住在城西，便各茶房問題：你們這裏，是西關房子貴吧？茶房道：住家的人，倒是在西城的多，程先生想租房子？現在西安城　，外路人來的太多，房子不大好租。我可以託人替你去打聽。志前道：我在西安也住不了多久，租房子作什麽，不過白問一聲。我另外有一件事要問你，你們這裏包工蓋房的人是什麽人？我覺得這個人有點厲害。茶房笑道：他拿過槍桿。説着，就低了聲音，唧唧喳喳，報告了一些話。又高聲道：這瓦匠倒很可憐，他有六十多了，因爲怕人家嫌他老，到於今没敢留鬍子呢。志前聽説，不覺歎了兩口氣。因道：他這樣大年紀，還賣力氣，連冷水都想不到一口喝。我很可憐他的。有機會，我得週濟他，你先别對他説。茶房笑道：你是好人。又低聲道：那女孩子，也是可憐人，你也週濟週濟罷。志前笑首摇頭道：你錯了，我不是這種人。你要作媒。説着，向隔壁屋子一努，茶房就笑着走出去了。（五九）</p>
<h3>兒子與老婆</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>兒子，無條件地總是自己的好。</p>
<p>雖則有人説「兒子，是愛情喜劇給你的罰鍰」，但這項「罰鍰」，不論有力無力，人們是大都樂於繳納的。設使有人「得天獨厚」，免繳「罰鍰」，他必得巧立名目，施盡種種方法爭得受有「罰鍰」的處分，繼稱心滿意。世間事情本來是大都涵有矛盾性的！</p>
<p>人們在爭得這項「罰鍰」的處分之後、麻煩是不絶地源原而來。生産費，撫養費，教育費，結婚費，病痛醫藥等各色費用，縱使你在經濟上力能擔負這些，但你精神上的苦痛，僅以「父母惟其疾之憂」一端而言，也就足够你操心勞碌。試想，人們爲了自己的兒子，受盡種種辛勞而不怨，爲什麽對於旁人的兒子就不是這樣，這是天性上眞切的「愛」。所以談到兒子總是自己的好，雖不免間有護短之嫌，但在愛的立場上説，却有不得不説好的内情。</p>
<p>老婆就不是這樣；因爲天性上眞切的愛的成分比之兒子的差得多。「同衾」「同穴」的名目固是很大，但做丈夫的十九喜歡尋找老婆的缺點，而伊的缺點又因想處日久而漸次顯露。其中雖不免有求全之毁，但在丈夫心上留有「不滿」的印象，實是一切仳離之源。—其實做丈夫的對老婆很少有感到完全滿足的時候。於是就覺得「老婆是人家的好」。不過人家老婆的好處，並不像自己兒子的好那般漫無條件，所以做老婆的還可運用法術趕上人家老婆的好處，使伊丈夫感到滿足。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （天哉）</p>
<p>朋友的情感，建築在虚僞的客氣上。</p>
<p>窮人没有錢讀書，有錢的人可又没有工替讀書。</p>
<p>越美的女子越喜歡醜男子，因爲要這樣才顯出伊的美麗。</p>
<h3>蒲菜蘆笋之辯正</h3>
<p>— 負負生</p>
<p>讀南宫生所談，濟南蒲菜，寫得極其週詳，惟其中稍有悮解之處，特爲補正之，蒲菜之一物，乃蒲草根上，浸在水内之一段，露出水面，即是蒲草綠葉，雖云大明湖中特産，但是産量不多，全靠城外之張園，及外縣有水田池塘等處出品，運來濟南銷售，長年不斷以五月起至十月止，此爲出産之時，價亦便宜，每在正二月間，其價最高，因農人選最肥嫩之蒲菜，收藏得法，故能得善價。至於葱頭蘆笋，即是蒲萊做戎，此節根本錯誤，蒲菜與蘆笋，完全兩種，蒲萊爲水中植物，如在葱一類，性跪爽，蘆笋爲土中植物，如茭白之類，性柔軟，當德人据青島時，有一德國商人林納，帶來蔬菜種籽，在海西紅石崖，闢地試棲，内中即有蘆笋，數月之後，在青島市上，有新鮮蘆笋出售，每磅價一元，三數年後，林納營業失敗，蔬萊亦停止種植，從此市上不復見新鮮蘆笋。若蒲萊可做罐頭蘆笋，濟南現有泰康，與上海食物公司，罐頭製造廠，其出品，如雞鴨，牛羊，蔬菜，青荳，水菓，等，種類甚多，廣銷各地，豈有不做蘆笋之理。且亦未見外商在濟南改買蒲萊者，青島海關，亦從來未聞有蒲萊出口，以上種種，可知蘆笋非我國原料，完全是舶來品，可無疑義又云濟南大明湖蒲萊的生産，每年總在一百萬元的光景，此言更是錯誤，以數方里之湖面，其中以魚塘，及　藕荷葉，爲大種出産，蒲菜尚居少數，一年出産，兩萬餘　，若蒲萊一種，决無超過三千元之數，所云總在一百萬光景，未悉從那裏計算，相去河啻數百倍。（却酬）</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>— （冰玉）</p>
<p>世界最高年齡</p>
<p>世界最高年齡原來是土耳其人薩爾阿干，他活了百三十五歲，在一世紀半内的過去的歷史，都是能記憶不忘，他前後結婚了三次，生過五個兒子，都是死在戰場的，他於前年突然患中風不起了。可是他生前嘗説可以活到一百六十歲，其女人亞美德彼易，今年也有百三十五歲，現在精神矍鑠，當一千八百五十四年塞伐司德波现大戰，他曾親蒞戰場，所以到了今日，經過的情形，都歷曆在目的。</p>
<p>最大的照相機</p>
<p>此次華盛頓商務部地下室，發現了很大的照相機，重十四噸，縱横各三十尺，好像一座鐵橋樣子，用三十七寸的鋼材帶成，其架基用鐵索吊起。這鉅大的照相機，以爲精密攝影航空地圖之用，攝影者走進機器裏邊，攝取後，就可在裏洗片現像，聽説製造費，需美金一萬五千二百元，裝配也費了兩年的工程。</p>
<p>寶石的總量</p>
<p>有名的寶石商人强土米德，調查全世界所有寶石的總量，共有五十噸，照時價計算的值七百億元，現在全世界的礦山，從事開採寶石的工人，有五十萬琢磨的工人，裝箱首飾指環經營的商人，有二萬五千餘名，發售的商店有十萬家，最近因世界經濟不景氣，銷路在减，不過近年來，寶石的用途，並不限於裝飾上用，其他在工業方面，亦多以寶石，作爲鑽孔用。</p>

<p>八十歲的新娘</p>
<p>距今約半世紀以前，有一位少年，名查理愛德維克，與愛里沙佩士麥絲波女郎、發生戀愛，二人都爲農村人，因爲他們的父母，都反對他們結合，於是各人都另外與人結婚了。韶光如矢，查理波垂腰曲背，麥絲波亦蒼顔白髮，其　凑巧麥絲已的夫去世，查理的妻亡故，二人都回念前情，再訂婚姻，他們遂於去年夏間赴愛金克士教會正式結婚，並訂偕老同穴的婚約，現在新郎爲八十歲，新娘爲七十五歲，這一對夫妻的結合，實爲世界聞所未聞的。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>過了好一會，伊開始説話了。這句話是給李蓮英説的。</p>
<p>「把樂聲止住了！」</p>
<p>我雖然不知道爲什麽緣故，伊忽然要把這樂隊的演奏止住，但我自己對於這一班古樂隊所奏的音節，實在也是感覺得聒噪得可厭：倘若不是宫中習慣如此，我必然早已用盡種種方法，諫勸太后把他們解散了。</p>
<p>因爲平日太后對於這一班古樂隊從不曾有遇絲毫厭煩的表示，而且伊老人家也很懂得幾支老曲子，每次吩咐止住樂聲，總是在一曲已終的時候：而現在伊，却出其不意的突然把他們止住了，使他們所奏的一個曲子，像被縊死的人一樣地猝不及備的給掩住了。這情形當然是很反常的；於是那些樂工都慌得手足無措了，來不及的把他們的樂器歸　到了那個架子上去，急爬在地上，没命的叩頭，惟恐他們自己已在不知不覺之中，觸犯了什麽刑章，或許是吹打的曲子，有了錯誤，以致太后聽得着惱起來了。</p>
<p>但太后却全不曾注意他們，獨自喃喃地説道：</p>
<p>「今天，乃是我們踏上這一片眞正屬於我們自己的土地的第一次；現在，我們是回來了！讓我們依舊恢復我們的日常生活吧」</p>
<p>！</p>
<p>伊説得是非常的簡單而動聽，像是一個富於情感的人所説的體己話，不像是一個太后所發的命令；而這個命令裏所指示的日常生活，其實祇是一種處處恪遵着幾百年來相傳的宫制，沉悶欲死的牢獄生活而已。（一六九）</p>

<h3>胡文虎君與國貨事業</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>南洋華僑大企業家胡文虎君北來觀察，滬人士熱烈歡迎，其盛况得未曾有，可見經營大企業，似不可爲而仍大有可爲者在也。本刊之歡迎胡君，從國貨界立場而言，亦大有歡迎者在焉：</p>
<p>國貨界之在今日，黯淡極矣，處處受束縛，重重困徵抽，税則之權，既不我操，傾銷之勢，排山而至。普通工廠言經濟，則捉襟見肘，言工作，則時伏暗潮，訴諸政府，政府既愛莫能助，求諸銀行，銀行亦自顧不遑，無端而匯水大增，平地而銷場頓滯，外商敵商，於輸入貨品之不足，復廣設工廠於我國門之内。以來奪我之生路，制我之死命，小工廠陸續停閉，大工廠岌岌可危，各地市場之充斥者，非外品，即敵貨，國民眼光短淺，唯利是圖者多，於是而國貨之命運，更陷悲觀。試一觀察，今日工廠之中國人經營而有成績者，能有幾家，言之可痛，思之泫然。</p>
<p>胡君具大宏願，有大魄力，其所經營之事業，除虎標永安堂以外，無一不爲社會服務，即無一不爲人羣造福，深願蒞滬以後，本其勇於服務社會之精神，造福人羣之宏願，對於國貨工業，儘量提倡，儘量投資，而奄奄一息之國貨工業，苟其力之所及，亦盼予以提携，賜以振作。須知今日國貨之進步，較諸十年前不同，即較諸五年三年以前，已自不同，所有精美的出品，明明有已駕舶來品而上之勢，胡君參觀所及，當驚爲出於意料之外，此不可謂非國貨界人努力之結果。即最近之中華産銷恊會，其所領導之工廠百餘家，與各地同志合辦之中國國貨公司十餘慶，其熱忱毅力，與終始如一之精神，自不可及。胡君於此，允宜力予贊助，以策其進行，即遇有應行籌商之工業，與應予維持之工廠，胡君亦應當仁不讓，樂助其成，蓋救中國惟一之途徑，惟有國貨事業。胡君既愛國情殷，則愛國貨之心自更深切，用於舉市歡迎之頃，貢其一得，以爲公餘之參考，胡君以爲何如？</p>
<p>國貨貢獻</p>
<h3>對於國貨商場的幾點小貢獻</h3>
<p>— 越星</p>
<p>從「統辦環球物品」的百貨公司走出，轉入經營「國産」的國貨商場，雖然這專「珠光寶氣」不及前者的「琳琅滿目」，但總能微微的透過一口氣來。—希望它未來的「日新月異」！</p>
<p>可是，事實會使你更加失望：職員「趾高氣揚」，並没有比靠「洋牌頭」的來得减輕：布置與職員分配的不調和；辦事的不求精慎等等，統可在你目光下搜檢出來，這些，難道果眞没有改良必要和不可改良嗎？</p>
<p>現在先來説説「職員」的一方面：</p>
<p>商店的職員，關係於貿易前途至鉅，這裏毋庸贅述，不過國貨商場的職員，尤應具備謙和誠懇的態度來對付上至「洋房層」下至「亭子間層」顧客，决不可視人貧富表示兩種「神氣！」可是誰能　保這種情形不會發生？並且是盛行着！衣冠華麗的常常會得到店員的殷勤，反之，誠樸的常常會遭店員的白眼，厲色，不睬，這是應該嗎？其影響於國貨前途非淺呢！此後希望各國貨商場多少對於這方面加予一些注意！</p>
<p>第二，布置與職員支配應迎社羣心理</p>
<p>譬如在專賣二元或一元多的呢帽的櫃上，我們可以猜想得到這交易决不是老爺少爺，而是大羣的經紀的中下層階級，（他們是都市的大羣層，也是「經紀」的大批消化者）今在這櫃上面使一二個摩登女職員去支持，至少會違反「他們」的心裏的—或者會使他們望而却步。（某一國貨商場，曾有同樣情形，結果，廉價物的售消成績極壞）。所以，凡是低廉部份，最好是派和藹些—或者年歲大一些，經騐足一些—的男職員，爲妥。尚有關於這種廉價物品部份的布置，還是以素樸「實惠」一些，到容易吸行所謂「中下階級」者。（我們常常看到某國低廉貨物，會平淡地深入到我國貧苦階級去，就是由小店販賣不尚㶷爛的原因）。</p>
<p>第三，辦事求精慎</p>
<p>跑進任何一國貨商場裏，時常會碰到店員答不出價目來的一回事—或者有時多説一點少説一點等情形均有。這是職員們對於貿易上的漠不關心！至於職員們動作之遲緩，（如手内包紥未完，任意與人談閑天等）隨意之嬉笑，没精打采等，—某有最可惡者寫顧主詢問時，店員每以。國貨本屬不精良「國貨祇有如此」等語答之，或詭言貨好，以欺騙顧主等。這種，均使顧客發生極不愉快之感情，與因此對於國貨之不信任心，其害之大爲何如哉！主持國産商業者，應注意及之！並應有相當訓練與指導，加於是輩職員，以期技術之增進。</p>
<p>當今外貨傾銷，國産前途黯淡之日，雖上述之點，事屬微小，然頗多人因此對國貨商場之不滿與輕視，務望經國産者勿以「小處着眼」而忽之！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>商標的商榷</h3>
<p>— 朱建華</p>
<p>在這大家提倡國貨的年頭兒，商品的商標，委實很重要，像最近杭州市開的商標展覽會，將國貨與外貨的各式各標商標，分類並列着，以冀一般人購用國貨時，有所遵循，其用意之深，與商標在國貨中關係之重要，可以想見了。</p>
<p>我們試把這問題分三層來説：第一商標的用英文，（多數是英文）是否因國人有崇外心理的謬見而在國貨上施用，我以爲「眞金不怕火」，何必一定要靠外國文字作商標，這只要以最著名國貨廠商作例，像康元製罐廠，章華毛織廠…等的出品，精良遠超舶來，就可以不辯自明，以觀此次杭州商展會的某國商標的專用華文，實在足使我們深切體味。尤以國貨化妝品，十九是用英文裝飾，有竟全用英文者，一般有心買國貨，而不識英文者，咸以爲非國貨而欲購又止，此非虚言，實是筆者與多數友人同　的，所以依我的意思，國貨　全用中文，標明出品廠家尤其要緊。</p>
<p>第二問題便是「名稱」，我以爲商標的名稱，應該雅　共賞，老少咸知，容易記憶才好，像某外商香烟公司的香烟商標，都合我國國情，有的用最普通熟悉的地名做商標的也有，可見他們是多麽深謀遠慮啊。而我國貨商標，則多用外國名字名詞歐化的名稱，實在是過於迎合一般人心理，而竟數典忘祖了。</p>
<p>第三就是名稱的諧音，以前曾經有過閙得很大商標名稱諧音的爭執，這實是很可痛心的一件事。要知在這我國工商業尚未發皇時代，正宜大家合力同心，各有負任，與外貨抗爭，以謀出路，還好以一己謀利爲目的，假借别人已出名的商標的諧音，來推銷自己的出品嗎？只要自己出品精良，宣傳得法，没有不能發展，盛銷各地的。</p>
<p>最後，筆者提出一個很小而關係很大的一件事，就是請國貨廠家大家聯合起來，創製一個共同的暗記號，在每件出品上印着，以最簡單，清楚，大小如意爲上，這樣在有心購出國貨的人，有一個確切不移的目標，宣傳既易，効力又大，何樂而不爲呢。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>靠我一個人弄得好嗎？</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>常常和友人們談天，談到國貨問題：内中有三個朋友，却很消極的説道：「提倡國貨，固然是我們的義務，但是，靠我一個人有用嗎？我個人雖然是竭力服用國貨，拚命購用國貨，可是，社會上的人，大部份都是不覺悟，買外貨仇的，仍舊是很多很多，那末，靠我一個人有什麽用處呢？…」這位朋友的語調，在表面上看來，似乎是不錯，好像是有相當的理由，可是，細細想來，却是錯誤之至，大謬而特謬。</p>
<p>爲什麽這位朋友的語調，是錯誤的妄謬的呢？因爲我們必須知道，深深地和道，社會是個人的集合，許多許多的個人「集合起來，才成功一個社會，所以個人是社會的起點，也是社會的中堅，社會中的每一個個人，共同覺悟起來，大家來誓志服用國貨，這固然是一個好現象，就是有大部份的個人，忠心服用國貨，漸漸地影響及於他人，這也未始不是一個良好的國貨宣傳法，所以，我們不能輕視個人，説什麽靠我一個人提倡國貨，有什麽用呢」的話，須知從我個人提倡國貨，以身作則，切實實行，由我而影響到我的家庭，我的親戚，我的朋友，其功效眞是十分偉大呢？我們怎樣可以説出這樣不合理的話呢？</p>
<p>所以，我在這裏，要貢獻一個意見，給熱心提倡國貨的朋友，當我們遇到了這種朋友的時候，我們可以和顔悦色的對此人説道：「只要靠你一個人，一定弄得好，你須看重自己，尊重自己，你看幾家蓬蓬勃勃的國貨工廠，其所以會如此發達者，無非靠着廠中的一個他，靠了他一個人，就弄得好，靠了你一個人，當然也弄得好的，你不要灰心，快些努力吧！」我們如果拿這種話，去應付人家，娓娓動聽的勸導人家，其人一定會感動的，一定會改正他的錯誤的觀念，而積極起來的，所以，「靠我一個人弄得好嗎？」這一句話，我們應該把牠打倒。</p>

<h3>外貨入超的比較</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>親愛的同胞，快快的改用國貨吧？不要留戀了，經濟亡國就在目前。</p>
<p>我現在把每年國際貿易入超的賑目，寫在下面，—願同胞們—細細觀摩，藉以警悟。</p>
<p>民國十九年—四萬一千四百九十餘萬兩。</p>
<p>民國二十年—五萬四千餘萬兩。兩年相較，該年增加了一萬二千五百餘萬兩。</p>
<p>民國二十一年—輸入超過輸出，爲五萬五千六百六十萬零五千二百四十海關兩；這年較二十年，又增咖三千二百五十九萬多海關兩。</p>
<p>民國二十二年—外貨的輸入，共計十三萬萬元左右，而出口貨祇有六萬萬元左右；由此看來，輸入超過輸出，竟有七萬萬元的相差。豈不可驚嗎？</p>
<p>總觀每年的貿易，外貨的入超，年年的增加；照這樣下去，豈不經濟亡國嗎？這種亡國，眞使人神鬼不知。親愛的同胞們！快醒吧！不要被外貨麻醉了！你們難道不怕嗎？可是這種亡國，眞比日本小鬼的飛機大砲，還要利害。</p>
<p>親愛的同胞！你們的麻醉病，趕快的到國貨商場去診察吧！不要馬馬虎虎的過你安閒的生活吧？如再不醒悟，國家快要亡在你們的手裏了。</p>
<p>短訊　大方貿易公司，專營蒙古駱駝毛，揀選頂上細羢，向在北平設廠製造，消毒冼净，機器彈匀，温暖輕軟，適合衛生，誠禦寒之美品，上海由該公司獨家經理，現以業務發達，總發行所已由愛多亞路遷至東棋盤街七十號云。</p>

<h3>上海紅木器業之今昔</h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>不堪回首話當年</p>
<p>上海紅木器業，大小百餘家，而過去十個月之營業，祇值洋六十餘萬元，爲四十年來所僅見，蓋紅木器爲貴族用具，民生凋疲，宜難暢銷，在最近十年來東西洋人頗喜用之，民國十九年，紅木器裝往日本者，價值洋一百二十餘萬元，歐美者約值洋五六十萬元至二十年度，東洋莊尚能有增無减，西洋莊祇值洋十餘萬元，迨至二十一二年，東洋不滿三萬元，西洋裝亦降至一萬元左右，今年則東西洋莊，均未動購，偶有，亦祇零星小件，詢諸喬源泰陶永仁等店，可以知其概况矣。</p>
<p>紅木器業，最盛之時代爲清季，烟窟賭場，均係當時大主顧，至民國十三年後，若琴桌，套几，龍頭架，鐘架，（懸圓形銅鏡者），烟盒，書盤，手杖等等，無一不爲歐美人所喜，加美國人尤酷愛之，即鐘架一項，每批出口，恒在二三萬具左右，其後發生貶價競賣之風，加之一般失業工人，另購小料木材，在家製造，站立洋行門口，以賤價向外人兜銷，向之每具須價洋三元以上者，現祇須售洋二元尋至一元一具，外人爭向購買，銷路既有，製者愈多，價亦愈落，而貨品則愈趨愈下，卒至爲外人擯棄，而爲其失敗之大原因，則爲洋式木器之代興，鋼鐵器業之崛起，銅鐵床之盛行，於是紅木器業，日見蕭條矣。</p>
<p>上海紅木器業，分二帮，一曰紅木嫁妝業，專製大件紅木器者，一曰紅木小件業，專製各種紅木小件者，完全手工業，向以揚州人居多，二十年來，江陰之孟河人起而代之，其内部組織，有磨作，漆作，而獨無木作，因其製造紅木成器者，另有白坯業，紅木器業，向白坯業定製，歸而磨漆之，以之出售，而磨工，尤爲該業重要工作，同爲一器，價極有上下，往往爲磨工關係，我國製造紅木器具，始自明代，其木初來自安南，近多由暹邏進口，價以量計，每担價洋十八元左右，近年又有花黎木，香紅木，亦由暹邏而來，質紋較遜，價亦較賤，惟自洋式摩登木器盛行後，業紅木器者，爲迎合買客心理起見，每將紅木器之表面，鑲以影木花紋，用資美觀，上項影木，一般人每悮認即蔭木，實則影木自影木，蔭沉木自蔭沉木，至經營該項木料者，爲紅木拆料業。</p>

<h3>談魏晉間文人生活</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>從漢靈帝中平元年（黄巾亂起）到東晉恭帝元熙元年（晉亡），這二百年間，死個把人，本來算不得什麽一回事的。漢桓帝時，已經「京師厮舍死者相枕，郡縣阡陌，處處有之。」到了東晉初年，「中原蕭條，千里無烟：飢寒流隕，相繼溝壑。」「鄢陵舊五六萬户，今裁有數百。」這是怎樣一個大修羅場！但史家好像不十分關心這些人的死活，有幾個文人的死，大書特書給後人以很深刻的印象。文人給當局開刀，自黄祖殺禰正平始，曹操跟着也把那個多嘴的孔融殺掉了；曹丕又殺了許多文人，要不是看同胞手足之情，連曹植也幾乎不能免。（其實同胞手足，在曹丕也不十分管：任城王就給曹丕弄死的。）三國末年，那幾個大名士，司馬懿殺了兩個——夏侯玄和何宴，司馬昭也殺了一個——嵇康，他們的罪狀大致是相同的，不孝。可是臧榮緒在晉書阮籍傳上説：「屬魏晉之際，天下多故，名士少有全者。籍由是不與世事，遂酣飲爲常。……鍾會數以時事問之，欲因其可否而致之罪，皆以酣醉獲免。」這倒是眞話，我們都知道曹操·曹丕·司馬懿·司馬昭，他們自己也並不是忠臣孝子；以「不孝」殺那些名士，不過是個託詞。</p>
<p>有人問問曹操司馬懿·爲什麽一定要把文人來開刀呢？我們先找幾件外國的故事來談談：希臘那麽一個標榜自由的民族，爲什麽容不得蘇格拉底那個大哲人多活幾年呢？蘇格拉底死的時候，已經七十一歲，遲早就要死的了；希臘人就有那麽急性非趕緊解决這個人不可。蘇格拉底原没有什麽大罪過，只是逢人詰問，引起青年們對於現狀的懷疑，使希臘人不再醉生夢死下去；所以控訴他的那三個人，梅利多斯（Meletus）等，説他「否認國家所承認的神們，另外唱道新神，使雅典青年腐敗。」這是一件事。還有一件事，法國大革命時候的人物，我們中國人最熟知的有一位羅蘭夫人：她臨死時候，對着自由神的石像説：「自由呀！自由呀！世人不知借你的美名，犯了多少罪惡！」她的丈夫聽到她被殺的消息，也當天自殺了；身邊留一小紙條，説：「但願通國厭棄這種殘殺無辜的罪惡，回過頭來，發現眞正人道罷！」她們夫婦倆都有歡喜教訓别人的脾氣，至死不悟！魏晉間文人，大概也害了這種多嘴的毛病的，什麽事都要説出一番長長短短的道理，甚至有對黄巾去誦孝經的；「秀才遇着兵，有理説不清」，誰耐煩聽你的嚕囌呢；我們讀嵇康寫給山巨源的信，就覺得可笑：什麽「七不堪」，什麽「二不可」，無非惹人頭痛，因而送上斷頭台。這種毛病，連所謂田園詩人陶淵明，都不能免，（諸如雜詩，擬古，讀山海經諸篇，字裏行間　都有憤激不平之氣存在着。）更無論其他文人了。文人不得善終，在某種情形下，也可説是命定的！</p>
<p>他們躱避這現實的方法，我們看來頗有點幽默。在他們之間，時興三部古書，老子，莊子和周易，老子莊子都是教人回到混噩無是非無差别的境界去的，「未嘗先人，而嘗隨人；人皆取實，已獨取虚；人皆求福，已獨曲全。」如不知人心如鏡，一到虚靜境界，什麽隱秘，更看得清清楚楚：反不如在勢利場中鬼混，眞能昏天黑地，不見天日。這樣，他們想在老莊哲學中找到安身立命的隱蔽處，結果，更把是非看得分明，更不能安身立命。他們第二種躲避現實的方法是飲酒，司馬昭要替司馬師求婚於阮籍，阮籍一醉六十日，使來使無從開口。以酒醉來躲避，只有這一次是有實效的。後來司馬炎讓九錫，公卿大夫要一力勸進；那篇勸進文，奉命非要阮籍動筆不可。阮籍也想借酒醉來躲避，畢竟不可能；只得就案寫成，讓來使鈔了去。大概嵇康也不大贊成阮籍的辦法，所以説：「阮嗣宗；唯飲酒過差耳；至爲禮法之士所繩，疾之如仇……」因爲如嵇康那樣性格的人，喝醉了酒，方會靜默下去；阮嗣宗本是「與物無傷」的，酒後反常，會惹些是非也未可知呢。第三種躱避現實的方法，是入山修道，學做神仙。可是修道愈有工夫，説起話來愈是刻毒。那位隱在蘇門山的孫登，老實不客氣，就説嵇康「才多識寡，不得善終」；好在嵇康並不是得君行道的人，否則孫登自己也就要不得善終的了。魏晉文人種種自己麻醉自己躲避的方法，都不見實效，只能如駝鳥一樣，把頭鑽在樹林裏，當作自己已經躲起來了，讓獵人捉了去拿去宰割。</p>
<p>東晉以後，佛家的思想傳播過來了，釋迦的教義代替了老莊的教義。第一等聰明人。大都出家做和尚去；在另外一個世界裏有大法事可做，不必和現實混在一起，才是眞正的躲避起來。並且在另外一個世界，對於人間世的種切，都有從頭來過的公平正直的總算賑，那一切憤憤不平之氣，自然而然地沉寂下去。所以要躲避現實，單靠自己麻醉是難得見效的，最要緊的要如佛家一樣能有另一乾坤可去。那就比較的安全了。</p>
<h3>無題之一</h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>烏鴉划過房頂，四下公鷄對啼，毛驢也望着曉色嗚㗒，夜只餘稀疏的黑點。</p>
<p>望窗外：田野露出微徑，高梁頂上已看見晨風，茅屋裏播出老人的咳嗽。</p>

<h3>秋戀</h3>
<p>— 牢一</p>
<p>好像有人這樣説過：春天是「愛人」，秋天就好比「戀人」一般了。即是説，春天的活潑固然可愛；秋天的深沉，尤其令人可戀了！</p>
<p>我一向是不怎樣愛春天的人；但我實實在在是可戀秋天的。正猶我平素讀詩時不愛李白，而愛杜甫，讀小説時不愛莫泊桑，而愛屠介湼夫，是同樣的心思。</p>
<p>每每我感到，感到客裏的閒思，黄昏時候的庭院，庭院裏梧桐，梧桐葉上的晚風，晚風裏傳來無限蕭瑟的調子！覺得，人生便是如此的情景了。</p>
<p>加上，寂寞的欄杆，欄杆外淡淡地秋水，水上的漁舟，漁舟的晚唱，晚唱應着遠遠的山村，山村中縵繞着黯澹的烟影，烟影裏鎖着幾處黄葉紅楓，風聲漸漸，呈現着一種悽惋的顔色！一陣陣的歸鳥，一陣陣的犬聲，一陣陣怨婦碪杵的閙響，這宇宙，這人生，這一切，你可盡量的玩味！盡量的咀嚼！咀嚼時，你便知道，知道宇宙在裏面，人生在裏面，一切都在裏面了。</p>
<p>人生不過數十寒暑。過了三十歲的人，已感到半世年華，如像西偏了的太陽一般：漸漸的過去，漸漸的没落。猶之一年四季的當中，倘若秋天一過，則萬物的景象，便是一天一天的衰老，一天一天的毁滅下來！你能不感傷麽？</p>
<p>人過三十歲已飽嘗世味，秋在節令中，總算飽經刑喪了；因此，三十歲時候的人生使人留戀；一年當中的秋天，更足使人留戀了！</p>
<p>如今呢，深秋將盡，時令慢慢的近了冬天。我人已經是三十一歲了。我舍不得秋天，我舍不得三十歲的年華，我深深覺得，秋天過去了還有來的；三十歲過去了還有什麽呢？</p>
<h3>烏拉齊沙漠（上）</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>太陽出來，就有一羣人趕着牲口從努庫臺平原邁進了烏拉齊沙漠。</p>
<p>烏拉齊沙漠像一片波平浪靜的海，平平坦坦的一眼望不着邊際。夜來的風早就停了，天空已經晴得没有雲，太陽光漸漸的發着熱。人們，駱駝，馬，牛，羊，……黑壓壓的一羣，開始了蠕動，蜿蜒的行列，像一條長蛇。趨趨的前進。</p>
<p>騎在駱駝上的巴古里克，一向的十足神氣現在完全消失了，搭位着腦袋，不知在想什麽？他的女兒它尼拉，照凖他騎的駱駝的屁股上使勁的打了一鞭子。</p>
<p>—爸爸！達里岡厓今天可以到吧？</p>
<p>抬起頭來啾了他女兒一眼，什麽也不説，擠了一擠眼，把頭又低下去，索性連眼睛也閉了。</p>
<p>—天堂的達里岡厓啊！</p>
<p>希望像隻螞蟻在每個人心上爬，從内心衝出來的一股熱力，激動了渾身的血液，没頭没緒的幻想在每個人的腦海裏翻花樣。</p>
<p>越走越熱，太陽火剌剌的炙着沙漠，炙着人，炙着牲口，炙着這一羣行列，一切都被熱力所壓抑着。人們身上淌着熱汗，女人的上身衣服都呌汗浸透了，緊緊貼在肉上，奶子在掛子底下顯得清清楚楚。馬嘴裏吐着白沫。羊跳着　嘷呌。狗拉搭着舌頭呼呼喘，跑一氣歇息一氣。駱駝和牛汗已經濕透了渾身的毛，在陽光下發着亮光。</p>
<p>人的呼息，小孩的哭呌，老太婆的怨言，羊的哀呌，牲口的蹄響，……種種不同的聲音混雜在悶熱的空氣裏澎漲起來啦。</p>
<p>他們一聲不響，用了藏着希望而又帶着高興的眼睛，看着海一般的，平坦的，廣闊的，和天邊連在一起的沙漠。</p>
<p>誰也不能把思索拌住，達里岡厓天堂老是在腦子裏跳躍，一刻不停的跳躍。</p>
<p>…達里岡厓，那裏有宫殿，有樓閣，有房子，有米吃，冬天不下雪，不括風，一年到頭老是暖暖和和的，無論什麽時候草都是青蕪蕪的；這是喇嘛奉巴彦王的命天神祈求的，天神因爲很愛我們，所以賜給了我們這座優美的天堂—達里岡厓……—當巴彦王的使臣諾音向大家宣布這個消息時，誰心裏不羡慕，及至巴彦王又吩咐諾音領着大家從努庫台平原往達里岡厓遷移時，没一個不喜歡得直蹦亂跳。現在他們把諾音的話回味着，希望變成了一朶美麗的鮮花，在每個人的心裏噴着甜蜜，噴着香氣。</p>

<p>機關車號呌了第一聲後，岔道夫單調的啐口痰，用綠色旗敲着腿脛，緩緩走向閘口去。冷落的小車站上突然騷閙着了。冷食小販，紙烟呌賣者，賣白開水的孩子和婦女……向有烟子昇起的遠處探望，期待着八十二次客車。</p>
<p>那矮小的老頭子佝僂的蹲下去，彷彿並没聽到那些，在去站埠的通口處，照常日的樣子展開褡褳。一個着制服的站役從身邊擦過，忽促在他肩膀上拍了一掌。</p>
<p>「朋友，估半斤白燒。這回不寒傖。」</p>
<p>説着跑進去。</p>
<p>「唔？好好……那自然。」</p>
<p>儘管應酬着，頭却並不抬起。</p>
<p>鬍子上沾着很多灰。就在八月天罷，那有些欠正的鼻崖下還有大顆汗滲出。領口兩個鈕子撒開着，露出紫褐色的鎖鋌骨。團團的頭上罩着頂毡帽，破舊得像一張荷葉；沿一直垂下來，遮住那寛得出奇的腮巴骨。那副憔悴樣子，無論怎樣不會更像一個倦於跋涉的旅客了。</p>
<p>那些多半屬於鄉下人或小商人的旅客，並不高貴。拖起沾泥的脚，背負着破襤行囊，嘘一大口烏氣，抹着滿是炭渣的臉，懶懶走出通口。</p>
<p>「南海觀音香莩，（註）不論癱瘓傷百病，經年不治……家裏有老有少末？……三個包好，五個除根。」</p>
<p>他以淮水流域的口音兜攬生意；反復喃喃着，聲音低微而懶散。證明他是不拆不扣的酒徒。</p>
<p>他很明白那乘客的弱點：他們在外鄉勞辱了半年或數載，手裏積蓄下一些錢財，要回家去看看年邁的老的和操勞的妻子。因爲寒貧，毛病也就會默然侵入人的内部。世間也只有這等人有枉然的孝心。住醫院請大夫。無力；郎中也成年不到鄉曲地方，爲着盡人事，壯年人是干心破費幾個的。所以他狡黠的䀹着眼，詭計也盡往這空處挑剔。</p>

<h3>易培基的贓物</h3>
<p>— 頑</p>
<p>我昨日坐在亭子間裏，聽見隔壁一位老婆婆駡人，其餘多不明白，我就聽清楚她兩句道「你這小狗子，惡貫滿盈，總有自投羅網的一日。」因患起鄭莊公道「多行不義必自斃，」孔老夫子亦説「貨悖而入者，亦悖而出，」這原是天公地道的事，這老婆婆的話，越想越有道理，</p>
<p>後來又想想，這老婆婆的話，是絶對運命論的説法，在現在的潮流中，總有些兒不對，現在是主張人權論的，主張功利主義的，（恕我誤解這兩主義）人定可以勝天，人當征服自然，誰强，誰去佔有，誰有勢力，誰得搶地盤，奪飯碗，什麽呌仁義道德？什麽呌守法奉公？這多是强者欺騙弱者的論調。</p>
<p>易培基於民十八年間，充任故宫博物院院長，李宗侗充任秘書長，陸續將保管之珠寶部份，盗取眞珠一千三百一十九粒，寶石五百二十六顆，以假珠掉換眞珠者九千六百零六顆，以假寶石掉換眞寶石者，三千二百五十一顆，其餘將原件内拆去珠寶配件者，計一千四百九十六處，此外尚有將緝米珠流蘇及翠花嵌珠寶手鐲等類，整件盗取者，爲數甚巨，均一律佔爲已有，其餘侵佔僞造妨害公務之案甚多，不能盡舉。</p>
<p>現在江寧地方法院檢察官，偵查完畢，提起以訴。這樣監守自盗，罪大惡極的人，自應立將易培基緝拿到案，審訊明確，明正典刑，但是易培基以租界爲護符，漢奸爲保障，欲緝捕其人，恐屬不易，正如「强盗落海，」何處追拿。大可逍遥法外，作租界之庽公，度其優游富裕的生活。</p>
<p>昨據天津電：易培基匿居津日租界浪速街，極不自由，流氓地痞，日往敲詐，鄭逆孝胥，以清室寶物，應歸清室所有，前派僞國務院事務官日人岸田來津，向易培基索去寶物大部，易因懊恨異常，倘果眞如此，則易培基的鼠竊狗偷，原是一場辛苦，爲他人造福，就是我替他想想，也有些懊恨。</p>
<p>於是我又想到隔壁老婆婆的一句話，「小狗子惡貫滿盈，總有自投羅網的一日」。現在雖尚未到惡貫滿盈自投羅網的日子，但這日總是要到吧。現在我看看像易培基一類的人甚多，將易培基做個榜樣，請大家看看。</p>
<h3>聰明</h3>
<p>— 淡然</p>
<p>「聰明」當然是兩個好字，我們自從懂得人世間的言語以來自己便常在希望着能够「聰明，」尤其是父母希望兒女能够聰明的殷切，可以説是「天下父母心」很少例外的。可是蘇東坡却要説：「人人生子望聰明，我被聰明誤一生，但望生兒愚且魯，無憂無慮到公卿。」很多人説蘇東坡是才子，才子當然非聰明不可，然而他偏説「我被聰明誤一生，」那麽聰明兩個字的價值便有點可疑了。我知道一般聰明人一定可以説：「蘇東坡不過是讀書做文章的聰明，不是洞澈世故的聰明，難怪他不能好自做官，終究要謫戌以死了。」我們從一般的意見裏面很容易找出「聰明」二字的概念來，那便是「洞澈世故，臨機善變。」</p>
<p>然而孔老夫子有進一層的分析，他説：「大智若愚，」我們從他這句話裏可以找出兩個要點：第一，智便是聰明，既有大聰明，比較的自然有小聰明，那麽前面所説的聰明當然便是小聰明了。第二，大總明既然有些像愚蠢，一般人自然很難得看出，像哥侖布要到渺無邊際的大洋裏面去找陸地，瓦特看見壺蓋子被沸水衝起來都要少見多怪，在新大陸没有發現，蒸汽機没有發明以前，一般聰明人看見哥侖布瓦特這股傻氣，眞要笑掉了牙齒。</p>
<p>再次，孔老夫子還説了：「惟上智與下愚不移，」我們又可以知道，有大總明的人和愚蠢的人既然都有些固執不移，其不合時宜可知。我們更可以知道有小聰明的人時時在，「朝秦暮夢」自然是常事，惟至這樣，所以他們左右逢源，登龍有望。</p>
<p>中國人得天獨厚，聰明人委實不少，不聰明而自作聰明的人也爲數可觀，但是可惜都是一些小聰明，善變有餘，固執不足。所以國家社會以至文壇，搗得一個不得開交。</p>
<h3>三娘</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>昨日；太陽的光輝很明亮，新鮮！</p>
<p>三娘是昨日歸來的，帶了她的小女兒。</p>
<p>她歸來的時候，驚訝的對我説：</p>
<p>「啊！你竟長得這麽高了！只有二年多没見面。」</p>
<p>二年多没見面，三娘已有了女兒，而且也衰老了！</p>
<p>我不敢去掠動她的愁思，所以只説：</p>
<p>「日子過得眞快啊！」</p>
<p>（什麽季節，我記不起了！那時，正是石榴開花的當兒。</p>
<p>—三娘！幾時你出嫁了？快啦！哈哈。</p>
<p>碰到她的人，總是對她開玩笑。</p>
<p>一天，媽媽替我從箱子裏，拿出了一件穿過一次的新衣來。</p>
<p>—因，明兒是三娘出嫁的日子，你得去吃喜酒啊！</p>
<p>到了明天，我瞧着她坐了花轎去哪！</p>
<p>我又瞧兒三娘的媽媽，笑臉上帶着淚珠兒，在三娘將上轎的當兒，説：</p>
<p>—三娘！你自家兒得保重啊！</p>
<p>這句話，我聽得很清楚：好像清晨的烏鴉呌聲一般地入耳。</p>
<p>自後：</p>
<p>第一年，三娘没回來。傳來的消息：</p>
<p>她生了一個女孩子。</p>
<p>第二年，三娘没有回來。傳來的消息：</p>
<p>—她丈夫跌死了！</p>
<p>第三年，三娘回來了！她帶來了一個故事：</p>
<p>—……我的丈夫是一個泥水匠，他的性情很温柔，我同他結婚了一年多，從没有閙過一次！可憐他竟然從很高的五層樓上跌下來。死了！天啊！這一座洋房……是只怪獸哪！它，它活吞了我的丈夫……。</p>
<p>三娘是昨日歸來的，帶了她的小女兒。</p>
<p>—三娘！你在上海玩得好嗎？</p>
<p>説起了上海，她就會悲傷起來説：</p>
<p>—上海是一個刑場！罪惡的，使人們痛心的……</p>
<p>她的臉，是同失掉了伴侣的雁鳥一般的呈露着：憔悴而憂鬱的樣兒。</p>
<p>—三娘的命運不好啊！</p>
<p>二三年前的三娘，美麗的！</p>
<p>眼前的三娘，同枯了的樹枝一般。</p>
<p>—她祇有二十一歲哪！</p>
<p>（可憐的，年青的寡婦哪！你的生活是清淡的。</p>
<p>矗立着好看的貞節坊，佯笑的説：</p>
<p>—來！三娘！加入我們！）</p>
<p>昨日，太陽的光輝很明亮，新鮮！</p>
<p>（是三娘歸來的一天啊。）</p>
<p>今兒，綿綿地下着雨。弄潮了這大地上的一切。</p>
<p>明天，後朝，……且待看吧！不過，三娘總是咀咒那些矗立着的高洋房的</p>
<h3>貧血症</h3>
<p>— 俞人英</p>
<p>兩個兒，默默地；巓簸在公共汽車上。一束鮮花，一簍蘋菓。</p>
<p>車子轉到寂靜的馬路了。兩旁低矮的小洋房，從車窗裏可以看到裏面糊着巴黎的花紙；肉感的白俄女人在塗着口紅。</p>
<p>從車廂裏下來，在陌生的路上摸索着。「××療養院」五個字跳進我們的眼簾，問了聲門房。</p>
<p>「頭等病房在那兒？」找到了三層樓，在走廓裏碰着了一個白衣天使。</p>
<p>「王××小姐在那一間？」她問我要了一張楷片，我們等在門口頭。當她出來了以後，</p>
<p>「我們可以進去嗎？」她點點頭。白的粉牆，白的鐵床，白的被褥……；臨着照有陽光的窗口。</p>
<p>「誰告訴你的啊，我在這兒。」我還着會心的微笑。</p>
<p>「貧血症嗎這流行的疾病啊！」她的臉上的確清瘦了許多，上個星期我還看到她在家裏打着絨綫衫。</p>
<p>「這裏的環境好嗎？」</p>
<p>「够好啦。每天到花園裏施行一次日光浴。現在祇能喫一些魚肝油，水果，鷄蛋一類的東西。</p>
<p>坐在朝南的窗口，望着矮冬青的園徑裏，白衣服的天使，白衣服的病人；在中秋淡淡的日光下呼吸着。</p>
<p>「到國慶那天再來看您吧，我希望您早些恢復健康。」我們緊緊地握着手。跳上九路公共汽車，車廂裏靜靜的。</p>
<p>都市的洪流，使每一個人墮入貧血症的死亡綫上。對着寂寞的街景，深深地嘆着一口氣。</p>
<p>想着自家兒在病的况態下，爲生活而挣紥的情形；一幅布爾喬亞小姐層修養的樂園又在我的眼前一現。</p>

<h3>買國貨的新方法</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>中國科學不發達，工商業落在人家後頭，各種出品又很少改良，所以大都没有人家的好。一般人在習慣上當然要應用一種較好的物品，因此那些外國貨，便爲國人所樂用了。但我覺得國人不一定是要去買洋貨的，假使國貨能有進步，而一般店員能够注意到提倡國貨的工作，努力向他們介紹國貨的好處，那末他們也會改變喜買洋貨的習慣的。説到這裏，有些店員一定要説：「提倡國貨是政府，實業家，店主，以及一切顧客的責任，我們店員不過是依人作嫁，毫無行使意志的自由，那裏有提倡國貨約機會？並且我們假使做了職務以外的工作，那末，時時還有打破飯碗危險的咧！」這種説法，在表面上看來，似乎有相當的理由，但根據我幾年的經騐，實際研究起來，却不一定是這樣。我覺得站在店員的地位來提倡國貨是很適合的，並且還有許多便利的地方。現在特把我的經騐寫在下面，希望各店員和其他讀者們，加以切實的討論。</p>
<p>我也是一個商店的店員。這個商店已經開設了好幾年了。它是一個百貨商店，店中的貨物多數是洋貨，在這多數之中，日本貨更佔最大多數。因爲日本貨價值很廉表面上又很美麗，雖然應用</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>起來，不能耐久，但是我們國人的心理是只求眼前便宜，將來如何是無暇計及的。所以日貨的銷場很好，店老闆也因有利可圖，儘量收進。在好久以前我們店員曾想要求老闆少進外國貨，多多的推銷國貨，以便挽回利權，但又覺得這並不是老闆的問題而是顧客的問題，假使一切顧客都來購買國貨，那末洋貨自然歸於淘汰，老闆自在儘呌老闆不進洋貨路，那末這月店豈不是要關門嗎？所以我們又想到向顧客規勸的一法。但是在三年前，日本的狰獰面孔還没有現出，國人還没有覺悟到各國的武力和經濟侵略的可怕，而且因爲服用洋貨的習慣和貪圖便宜的心理，所以我們雖向他們或她們勸告，請其購用國貨，但結果很少效力，尤其是他們或她們的一種藐視國貨的態度，更令人感覺到非常的失望。</p>
<p>後來，九一八事件發生，日本的武力侵略，激起國人的愛國的熱心，對於日本貨多有點仇視，於是我們提倡國貨的最好的機會便到了。</p>
<p>我們店員在顧客剛跑進店裏的時候，就和他談起日本的可惡，和中國的損失，又説到購用國貨的利益，假使他是有知識的，當然不肯再買日本貨或其他洋貨了，並且爲了面子關你，也不好意思再買洋貨了。假使那顧客是一個眞正無知識没有愛國心的人，完全不了解我們所説的話，一定要買日貨，那末，我們也有方法對付。譬如他要買一雙日貨膠皮鞋，我們照樣拿給他看，但是總拿那些比較破舊的貨物，一面對他們説，日本因爲凖備打仗，不注意工商業，所以他的貨物也不比從前了。同時再拿一雙新到的國貨給他看，他們雖看慣了日本貨，但看見日貨没有國貨好，那末也會改買國貨了。至於購買洋貨的人，也用同樣方法對付，結果得到很好的成績，可見國人不一定都要去買洋貨的。只要一般店員能够注意到這一點，我想國貨的前途，就比較的有希望了。</p>
<p>像這種提倡國貨的方法，對於老闆也没有什麽損失的，因爲他開店的目的不過是想賺錢吧了，假使國貨能够暢銷，同樣也可以賺錢，他當然不情願去推銷洋貨做什麽「奸商」，而受國人的唾駡了。　　杏光上</p>

<h3>劉得勝在江西</h3>
<p>— 萬國安</p>
<p>（一）拐杖不見了</p>
<p>爬過了一個山頭，緊接着又是一個山頭。左右前後都是山了。劉得勝越爬越心焦！手裏拿着的那根步槍，簡直是變成了他的拐杖了。這個黑大個無疑地是忘了偵探的任務，一個勁兒地渾身用力向前爬。</p>
<p>在他底右邊的兩個一同出發的偵探，這時也不知爬到什麽地方去了。他向前爬個幾十米達遠，就用手扶着山坡上的小樹，張着大嘴露着一對虎牙，上氣不接下氣的喘着。</p>
<p>「日他個孩子！竟胡搗，那裏來的土匪，呌俺這個樣子爬山，把人爬死了也看不見一個。」黑大個把氣喘的差不多了，這樣一邊駡着又重新向前爬。</p>
<p>贛南七月的天氣，已經顯着特别的熱了。雖然山頭上不時飄着凉風。但那熱烘烘的陽光，可就把這大個黑螞蟻似的劉得勝，曬的腦門子上直冒油。</p>
<p>「俺不幹了！日他祖宗再幹！」</p>
<p>這黑大個可實在有點受不了啦！一屁股就坐在亂草上，不呌身旁的小樹擋着，差一點没咕嚕下去</p>
<p>「搬了你個舅子的！」</p>
<p>黑大個的砲仗脾氣發僞，一伸手要把那根槍扔出去　。</p>
<p>「小舅子！要不是你給俺當拐杖，俺眞要把你扔在這江西大山裏了。」</p>
<p>這是黑大個坐在草地上，嘴裏由快而慢的喘着熟氣，兩隻大眼睛呆呆的望着嚮晴的天，把一切的事情都忘記了，祇顧咀嚼着這現實的舒服勁兒。他越坐着越覺着够味，兩隻眼睛也漸漸地合攏在一起了。在大疲乏後「打個肫」是多麽寶貴啊！</p>

They arrived safely in Suiyuan at 8:25 p.m. A welcoming party of over a thousand people from military and political circles, including Princes Yun and De, and Xiao Zhenying, greeted them at the station.

<h3>Reading the Declaration of the Conference on Examinations and Appointments</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>On the 1st of this month, the Examination Yuan, to promote the national civil service examination and appointment system, convened a National Conference on Examinations and Appointments. The conference lasted for five days, with the participation of one hundred and sixty people, including many well-known figures from political and academic circles, gathering together and expressing their insightful opinions. It was a grand event. Yesterday, the press published the closing declaration of the conference, which, in addition to summarizing the outlines of the advisory resolutions, solemnly stated: "This conference does not seek high-sounding theories, but practical and easy-to-implement solutions. All resolutions must be implemented one by one." The sincerity of the words overflowed from the expression. We, eager for good governance, are also happy to elaborate on its meaning.</p>
<p>Today, in various countries around the world, officials are divided into political and administrative officials. The duties of the two are different, and their responsibilities are vastly different. Those who serve as political officials are generally highly respected and lead their colleagues, occupying a pivotal position. Therefore, their departure and retention are often determined by the will of the people. Administrative officials, on the other hand, are generally recruited through examinations and then employed, and they execute daily affairs in accordance with the policies formulated by the political officials. In order to ensure the administrative system and efficiency, countries generally have civil service protection laws as a shield for administrative officials, allowing them to serve with peace of mind and not be changed with political tides. However, this is not the case for administrative officials in our country today. Their dismissal, promotion, and demotion are mostly determined by the preferences of their superiors, and often depend on the strength of the recommending forces. As a result, those with real talent are often buried for life and unable to display their abilities, while the incompetent occupy high positions and wield power. Moreover, with positions being created for people and policies being abolished with the departure of people, the departure and retention of superiors becomes the standard for the advancement and retreat of subordinates. Everyone cannot avoid harboring the mentality of "five-day officials," and how can they be expected to work diligently, be honest and upright? As things stand, daily administration is often handled by newcomers, and the administrative system frequently suffers setbacks. Without solving the human problem, any good system or law will be useless. This can be asserted. The deliberation and resolution on the protection of civil servants in this session of the Conference on Examinations and Appointments is probably based on this insight. If it can be implemented simultaneously with the performance evaluation methods, then the goals of "recruiting true talent" and "preventing opportunistic advancement" can be achieved at the same time.</p>
<p>Our country has held several higher and general examinations in recent years. However, before the examinations were held, no proper arrangements were made for the placement of those who would be admitted in the future. Therefore, after the examinations, those who were admitted could not help but feel disappointed. Observing the situation, it seems to be no different from general universities that only know how to produce graduates without considering their prospects. Such a negative phenomenon should not be allowed to continue indefinitely. To reform in the future, it is necessary to strictly implement the performance evaluation methods for current civil servants in order to eliminate the inferior and retain the good, and thus free up vacancies for the placement of those admitted through the higher or general examinations. This session of the conference planned a great deal for the examination methods, and also made provisions for the performance evaluation item. The intention is to prevent the service performance of a civil servant from being entirely determined by his superior, and to have the central government conduct assessments as a basis for rewards and punishments. In this way, those who advance by opportunism and occupy positions without doing any work will have no way to hide their shortcomings and will eventually be eliminated. The conference declaration advocates for "strict implementation of performance evaluations for civil servants who 'come from recommendation letters'," "once a year, and stipulating a minimum percentage of elimination in order to clarify the officialdom and employ talents who have passed the examinations." This can be considered appropriate for the current ills. This is another aspect.</p>
<p>However, the above two aspects of the protection and performance evaluation of administrative officials are simple in principle, but difficult to implement. The responsibility for this cannot be solely borne by the examination and appointment organs, nor can it be effectively implemented overnight. It is hoped that other authorities outside the Examination Yuan can fully support and jointly promote the progress. The future of the country truly depends on it.</p>

In addition to consulting the Henan Provincial Government for investigation, it is also planned to send personnel for secret investigation," etc. It has been found that leaflets attacking this department were previously discovered here, but the facts are fabricated and the names are made up. While a secret investigation is underway, we suddenly saw the above news published in your newspaper. We immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to inquire about the truth. We received a telegram from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, which stated, "To Director Zhang Jingyu of the Construction Department of Kaifeng, the telegram is acknowledged. According to a report from the Secretariat, it was said that leaflets attacking the Construction Department of Bian Province were discovered in Beijing. The Shenbao telegram may be based on this. A secret investigation into the source is underway." This shows that the above telegram in your newspaper is based on leaflets and is purely untrue. Please make a sincere correction, which is greatly appreciated. Respectfully, Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Construction Department of the Henan Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>Democrats Win a Landslide Victory in the United States with Thirty Million Votes</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Expresses Delight</p>
<p>The Republican Party Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Governor Sinclair Loses the Election</p>
<p>[Washington] The Democratic Party won a landslide victory in yesterday's general election, and the Republican Party's last stronghold has also collapsed. The Democratic Party's</p>
<p>victory is comparable to Roosevelt's election as president in 1932. Postmaster General and Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Farley, claimed last night that the famous Republican Party has now disintegrated. Reports from various places this morning have confirmed this statement. Although reports from all states have not yet arrived, the Democratic Party has swept away the Republican forces from the East Coast to the West Coast. Farley's claim of an extraordinary Democratic victory has now been confirmed. Farley also said that President Roosevelt is very pleased with the public's trust in his government, but prominent Democratic candidates have still suffered defeats. According to the latest reports, Republican candidate Moling is expected to be elected Governor of California, while Democratic candidate Sinclair has failed. According to incomplete reports, the Democratic Party has won more than ten seats in the Senate, which was beyond the expectations of Democratic leaders, as they initially only hoped to gain four more seats. Furthermore, according to continuous reports from various places, the Republican Party was not very successful in the House of Representatives election either. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] As of 7:00 AM this morning, the results of the election are as follows: In the Senate, 32 seats were up for election, and the Democratic Party won 15 seats, the Republican Party 3 seats, the Farmer-Labor Party 1 seat, and the Progressive Party 1 seat. The results of 12 seats are still unclear. In the House of Representatives, there are a total of 435 members, and the Democratic Party won 208 seats, the Republican Party 52 seats, the Farmer-Labor Party 1 seat, and the Progressive Party 3 seats. The results of 171 seats are still unclear. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] The election results prove that the Republican Party has suffered an unprecedented defeat. According to the latest reports, the number of seats for each party in the House of Representatives is as follows:</p>
<p>Democratic Party 234</p>
<p>Republican Party 70</p>
<p>Farmer-Labor Party 1</p>
<p>Progressive Party 1</p>
<p>Results Unknown 127</p>
<p>Only two-thirds of the new senators were elected this time. The known number of seats is as follows:</p>
<p>Democratic Party 19</p>
<p>Republican Party 3</p>
<p>Farmer-Labor Party 1</p>
<p>Progressive Party 1</p>
<p>Results Unknown 11</p>
<p>So far, the Democratic Party has gained eight more seats, and the Republican Party has gained three more seats. The Democratic Party has also won elections in various states and has gained an advantage in the New York State Legislature, which is the first time in twenty years. The Democratic member of the New York State Governor, Lehman, has been re-elected and has won between 700,000 and 800,000 votes, which is even more than President Roosevelt won when he was elected governor of the state. Republican Party member Bairidan, who advocates for a "big navy" and has served in Congress for 22 years, also lost the election this time. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] This election is the most important in the United States since the Civil War. President Roosevelt's new policies will therefore be supported by the public in the next two years or more. The most shocking aspect of the Republican Party's defeat this time is that California's acting governor, Moling, has defeated Sinclair. Sinclair was confident of victory, but voters mostly voted to support Republican candidate Moling, so Sinclair admitted defeat. Pennsylvania Senator Reed, who was actually the leader of the Republican Party in the previous Congress, received far fewer votes than Democrat Gu Fei. However, the Republican candidate for governor of the state, Schneider, has surpassed the Democratic candidate, Ouer. During this election, voters of both parties mutually accused each other of intimidation, violence, illegal registration, and various acts of destroying election laws. There were also accusations against the police, and many people were arrested for violations in various places, especially in Pennsylvania, where emotions were extremely high because four people were shot dead by machine guns in Haeston. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Judging from the results of the national election, which began tonight, there is no doubt that the next Congress will still be controlled by a Democratic majority. Most of the districts are still counting votes, but based on preliminary reports, the Democratic Party may further increase its power in the Senate, and the Republican Party has not made any progress in the House of Representatives. Because this election involves many issues, the gains and losses of the Democratic Party cannot be immediately regarded as an accurate expression of the people's views on the "New Deal." The weather has been clear for the past two days, and people have been voting very enthusiastically. By the deadline, an estimated 30 million people in about 47 states had voted. California, due to the candidacy of socialist writer Sinclair for governor, has attracted the most attention. According to official statistics, about 2 million people voted in the state. President Roosevelt went to Hyde Park early this morning to vote. The president and his family drove to the town hall in heavy rain to fulfill his national duty. When the president walked to the registration office, the female supervisor asked for his surname. The president smiled and replied, "Roosevelt." The female supervisor immediately blushed, and the voters booed in jest. Someone asked the president about the election situation, but the president smiled and did not answer. On the same day, Sinclair also voted in Pasadena, California. Newspaper reporters chased after him relentlessly. Sinclair said that if he loses the election, he will immediately launch a movement to recall Governor Moling based on the recall and referendum rights stipulated in the California Constitution. Yesterday, riots occurred in several places. In addition to the five deaths in Pennsylvania, there was one death each in Missouri and Kentucky. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] President Roosevelt has won the election and can freely carry out his new policies for two years or more. Even the Republican Party admits this result, as the voting results from the eastern, central, and western states this afternoon all support the Democratic Party. There is little doubt that the Democratic Party has won a landslide victory. Tonight, 60 Democratic members and 5 Republican members of the House of Representatives have been re-elected. The Democratic Party expects to win at least a two-thirds majority in the Senate and maintain its power in the House of Representatives. Today, the national election was conducted amidst mutual accusations and disturbances between the two parties. In addition to the five deaths from machine-gun fire in Haeston this morning, there were also deaths from fighting in other places. One person died in Ohio, and a black man was killed in Seattle, and several others were injured, because black people tried to vote and were beaten by the crowd. Today, a large number of police officers were protecting the polling places in California and New York to prevent bloodshed. Socialist author Sinclair, who wants to win a seat as governor of California, has organized five teams of lawyers to help people fight for the right to vote, because the opposition claims that there are 10,000 illegally registered voters in one place in Los Angeles. Sinclair and Republican Maolimu are both confident of victory. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Judging from the election results last night, it is almost a certainty that the next Congress will support the government's new policies. New York Governor Lehman is expected to be re-elected, and the Democratic Party has an advantage in West Virginia, Maryland, and New York. All Democratic members of Congress from Georgia, Mississippi, and the southern states have been elected. Two black candidates from Chicago are competing against each other. The Republican black power is slightly weaker. The Democratic Party can definitely increase its number of seats in the Senate to two-thirds, because the traditionally famous Republican bases have now been gradually captured by the Democratic Party. The members of the House of Representatives who have been elected are 117 Democrats and 12 Republicans. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan Tries to Shirk Responsibility in Oil Dispute, US Unhappy with Reply</h3>
<p>[Washington] The State Department received a telegram today from Ambassador to Japan, Grew, reporting the gist of the Japanese government's reply to the US protest against the monopoly of kerosene in "Manchukuo". The State Department authorities have not yet studied it, but it is heard that the reply is unlikely to be satisfactory from the US point of view. It is reported that the reply reiterated Japan's intention to bear no responsibility whatsoever and asked the United States to negotiate directly with the "Manchukuo government". The State Department authorities have previously made it clear that this attitude of Japan is to evade responsibility, and the State Department still holds this view, so direct negotiations with "Manchukuo" are completely out of the question.

<h3>France May Send Troops to Saar, Germany Protests</h3>
<p>Same Action Taken with British and Belgian Governments</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Denies Military Preparations</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German government, due to the possibility of France sending troops into the Saar region, has today instructed its ambassadors to Britain, France, and Belgium to lodge protests with the governments of their respective host countries. This action was prompted by France's recent declaration that if the German Social Democratic Party were to endanger the security of the Saar during the plebiscite, France intended to send troops into the region to maintain order. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[Paris] This afternoon, Foreign Minister Laval met with the German Ambassador to France, Coster, to discuss various issues of concern to both countries, for a considerable amount of time. The Saar plebiscite was of particular importance. The atmosphere of the conversation was very cordial. Laval stated that France was unwilling to abandon the international obligations it bore to the League of Nations, nor could it abandon them. He also stated that rumors in foreign newspapers that France was preparing for military action in the Saar were untrue. The German Ambassador also stated that Germany was extremely willing to maintain order and that the German government had already taken measures to prevent chaos during the Saar plebiscite next year. (This refers to Hitler's ban on the Nazi stormtroopers from wearing uniforms, parading, or holding gatherings within forty kilometers of the Saar border for one month starting January 10th.)

<h3>Reopening of Naval Talks Due to Simon's Diplomatic Efforts</h3>
<p>Britain to Propose New Plan to Break Deadlock</p>
<p>Anglo-Japanese Consultations Held Four Times Yesterday</p>
<p>[London] It is generally believed that today's naval talks will be of a critical nature. British chief representative Foreign Secretary Simon will propose a method to bring the American representative into the proceedings, so that the talks can be restarted on a tripartite basis. The British and Japanese representatives are currently engaged in busy consultations, while the American representative has no scheduled meetings, but eagerly awaits the results of the Anglo-Japanese meeting. The American representative believes that the outcome of this meeting will be of great importance to the overall situation of the talks' future. It is expected that the second step will be a meeting between the British and American representatives tomorrow.</p>
<p>The British and Japanese representatives continued naval talks in the House of Commons from 4:00 PM today, lasting at least an hour. Atherton of the American delegation held confidential discussions on naval talks at the British Foreign Office this morning. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] In the naval talks, the Japanese delegation has opposed all proposals that do not include Japan achieving equal rights. Therefore, the British side seems to want to propose a new compromise plan that is more easily acceptable to the Japanese side. The British delegation intends to follow the proposal made by the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito (who was previously stationed in Washington), to grant Japan the right to naval parity gradually. If the Japanese government representatives reject this plan in its entirety, or reject the manner of its implementation, then the British delegation intends to make further concessions. It is heard that Britain is considering a method to abolish the quantitative limitations on naval strength but still maintain qualitative limitations. In other words, the three major naval powers, Britain, the United States, and Japan, can freely build all types of warships without any restrictions on their number, but the tonnage of each type of warship and the size of its gun caliber must comply with strict limitations. This afternoon, the entire British delegation will meet with the Japanese delegation. It is expected that at least the aforementioned British proposal will be presented at today's meeting.

<h3>Anglo-American Representatives' Meeting Opens Door for Japan</h3>
<p>U.S. Expresses Willingness to Continue Talks on a New Basis</p>
<p>Persuading Japan to Comply</p>
<p>[London] Following diplomatic efforts by Britain, the representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan will continue their talks in full this week. This afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Simon received the chief American representative, Davis, at the Foreign Office for a meeting lasting one hour and fifteen minutes. The two mainly studied the current situation from the perspectives of Britain and the United States. Simon proposed a plan to continue the talks and earnestly stated that the British government wished to see all parties reach an understanding, so that the 1935 conference could be convened and have some hope of success. Davis stated that the American delegation did not want to end this meeting without studying all possible opinions. The American delegation was willing to listen to everything the Japanese government wanted to propose. At the same time, he believed that procedural issues were very difficult if they wanted to maintain the existence of the London discussions. Davis also told Simon that the American delegation was prepared to continue talks on a new basis in line with Simon's intentions. After Davis made this assurance, the news was announced that the delegations of the three countries would resume talks in full this week, preceded by a meeting of the British and Japanese delegations.

<h3>Britain Seeks Mediation to Save Stalemate</h3>
<p>To Suggest Slightly Revised Ratio</p>
<p>American and Japanese Views Remain Divergent</p>
<p>[London] It is generally expected that the preliminary naval talks will reopen, and it is believed that the British side will seek a way to mediate between Japan and the United States. This impression arose after Foreign Secretary Simon met with American representative Davis this afternoon. If Japan's approval is obtained, a meeting of Britain, Japan, and the United States may be convened tomorrow. However, the reopening of preliminary talks should not be regarded as progress in the situation, nor should it be seen as a convergence of opinions. The United States and Japan still insist on their own positions. It is unknown on what basis the talks will be reopened. According to British political circles, the British delegation will only reiterate the conciliatory suggestions it has already made at the next meeting, and advocate seeking a compromise between the current 5:5:3 ratio and the naval parity demanded by Japan. In other words, adopting a ratio close to 5:5:4. This approach is simply a renewed effort on a basis that is already known to everyone. The suggestion of a 5:5:4 ratio is not new. However, this ratio is not welcomed by either the United States or Japan. As for the abolition of the Washington Treaty, what the British and American delegations emphasize is to ascertain the date on which Japan declares the abolition, and not to prevent it. The facts discovered yesterday by the League of Nations Mandates Commission from reviewing the report on Japan's rule over the Pacific Islands show that Japan has already violated the League of Nations Covenant in fact. (According to Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, no military installations may be set up in mandated territories). However, general opinion believes that Japan will formally declare the abolition of the Washington Treaty before the League of Nations discusses the issue of Japan's violation of the League of Nations Covenant in the Pacific Islands.

<h3>London Times Elaborates on Naval Situation</h3>
<p>Breakdown of Negotiations Invites Competition</p>
<p>Little Possibility of Conflict Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[London] As the preliminary naval talks are about to reopen, the Times published an editorial stating that the Washington Naval Treaty has become obsolete and that a new treaty limiting navies must be found to replace it. It said, "The purpose of the naval talks here is to lay the foundation for next year's naval conference, so that there is a possibility of establishing a new agreement. Even if only the ground can be leveled at this time, so that construction can begin in the future, the world will not necessarily be harmed. As far as Britain is concerned, its only main point of view is that even if the naval talks break down, the impact will be that the United States' existing shipbuilding plan, which is already very large, will be further expanded. Britain will not be alarmed by this and will deal with it calmly, because there is absolutely no possibility of conflict between the British and American navies. Even at the end of the world's civilization, they will not think of resorting to arms. Furthermore, the situation between Britain and the United States is indeed such that the British Empire's self-governing dominions such as Canada and Australia are all located on the Pacific coast. Their concern for maintaining the balance of power in the Pacific and for a satisfactory resolution of the naval issue may even surpass that of the mother country. It goes without saying that there is even less possibility of conflict between them and the increasingly large navy of the United States. All of this is indeed the real situation. But if it is said that Britain and the United States are about to form or are willing to form a united front to deal with Japan, then this is absolutely not the truth. Britain's sympathetic feelings and friendly relations with Japan have been long-standing and have not changed to this day, and Japan's desire not to be in an inferior position is also deeply understood by British people. However, naval competition is enough to lead to bankruptcy, and in Japan, its impact is even worse. Therefore, the three largest naval powers, Britain, Japan, and the United States, must work together to avoid it. In any case, qualitative restrictions must ultimately be maintained. In other words, competition regarding the tonnage of warships and the size of their guns can be avoided. Otherwise, if any country wants to build a larger navy and heavier warships, the result will inevitably be the total bankruptcy of its finances, and how can it be taken lightly? Moreover, the Washington Treaty contains important provisions regarding the construction of defensive fortifications by various countries in the Pacific islands and their policies towards China. The principles on which it is based are 'security equality' and 'China's territorial integrity.' These are the principles that cannot be abandoned in the current talks. Now, if we are good at overturning these principles before finding suitable replacements, the responsibility is so great that no one can bear it." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Building Secret Fleet with Militaristic Ambitions</h3>
<p>U.S. Naval Circles Disclose News</p>
<p>Another New Japanese Warship Completed</p>
<p>[Washington] The New York Times reports that U.S. naval circles are convinced that Japan has built a secret naval fleet, including six oil tankers with a speed of 18 knots per hour. These ships are no different from real auxiliary cruisers and were built secretly without being registered in the Lloyd's Register. Therefore, Japan now has 34 of the most modern transport ships in the world. These transport ships can all be converted into cruisers, and 21 of them have a minimum speed of 21 knots. As for U.S. transport ships, none have a speed of 15 knots. Some officers in the U.S. Navy hope that this issue can be raised for discussion in London. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The latest-style second-class cruiser Suzuka (8,500 tons, speed 33 knots), which has been built at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal since December of the 8th year of Showa (1933), is nearing completion and is scheduled to be launched on the 20th. (Japan United Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Britain Building Airfield Near Portsmouth</h3>
<p>Occupies a Strategic Position in Air Defense</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources have confirmed the news carried by the "Daily Herald" that the British government is building a large airfield. According to the newspaper, the British government plans to build a large-scale airfield on Thorney Island near Portsmouth, as the area occupies a strategic position in the British air defense line. The government is currently negotiating the purchase of the airfield base. After the construction of the aviation base is completed, it will be equipped with the most complete air defense equipment, with the aim of protecting the fleet docked in Portsmouth Harbor.

<h3>U.S. Naval Exercise: Two Destroyers Collide in Night Battle</h3>
<p>Aircraft Collide in Mid-Air and are Damaged</p>
<p>Los Angeles: During a U.S. Navy night battle exercise in Magdalena Bay, Lower California, today, two destroyers, the Ellis and the MacFarland, suddenly collided and were damaged. They are now being towed to San Diego for repairs. A famous naval aviator, Major Jeter, collided with two other aircraft during an exercise, causing damage to the wings and plunging downwards. Fortunately, he was rescued when the plane entered the sea. The other two aircraft were unharmed and flew safely back to their aircraft carrier. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Death Ray Gun Successfully Tested</h3>
<p>Intense Beam Causes Intoxication</p>
<p>Power Can Cause Aircraft to Lose Control</p>
<p>New Invention by French Engineer</p>
<p>[Paris] The inventor of the death ray gun told the Associated Press that several countries are now competing to purchase the manufacturing secrets of the death ray gun. The light can cause aviators to crash to the ground. French engineer Jacques Cremas said, "This invention has now moved beyond the experimental stage. Our experiments, initially with a reduced model shaped like a rifle, have now successfully launched the death ray. The French military authorities are now helping us expand this principle and are using special equipment in the fortresses of Cherbourg, Toulon, and L'Île d'Yeu for our application. Although foreign representatives have negotiated with us repeatedly, we are unwilling to sell without the permission of the French government." Cremas continued, "He, his brother, and an Austrian engineer named Reil Hoescher, completed today's invention after two years of experimentation. The death ray gun does not kill, but it only temporarily causes people to lose consciousness. People who are hit by the death ray are as if they are drunk. It only causes aviators to lose the ability to control their aircraft. The light is taken from a type of gold material produced in the United States or Germany. The light emitted by this metal is extremely strong, several times stronger than the light emitted by manganese. This light can be extended to eight or twelve seconds without dissipating. If you want to extend it further, it is not allowed by the facts, because the high heat is enough to melt the barrel of the gun." (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Grand Celebrations of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Three-Day National Holiday</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Moscow Soviet held a grand meeting at the Bolshoi Theatre tonight to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the October Revolution. The central organs of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and trade unions all participated in the meeting. Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, and members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the government sat on the stage. A speech was delivered by Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is celebrating the 17th anniversary of the October Revolution with a three-day holiday, which began today. The capital has taken on a joyous festive appearance, with decorations, models, charts, and drawings everywhere, showing the development of various departments in the Soviet Union over the past 17 years. At the same time, the reconstruction and improvement work of Moscow's architecture has just been completed. Some old buildings that hindered traffic have been demolished, replaced by wide streets and large squares. Tall buildings have removed their scaffolding overnight, changing the face of Moscow. The decoration of streets and squares shows the various stages of development of the Soviet Union, and there are models of the first section of the Moscow subway, which has now been completed, and the Moscow-Volga Canal, which is currently being dredged. Workers and collective farmers from all over the country have sent representatives to participate in the celebrations, and a large number of foreign workers' delegations have gathered here.</p>
<p>The newspapers detail the achievements of the Soviet Union in politics, culture, and economics. Izvestia said, "The foundation of socialism has been extremely firm and solid, and no counter-revolutionary sewage can shake it, and no imperialist cannon can destroy it, because our country has been completely transformed. At the same time, in the large-scale factories, collective farms, mechanized mines, and even airplanes, submarines, Arctic stations, and the fearless navy, our newly rising people are guarding them at all times. These people have been deeply trained, and they will definitely fight against their class enemies and their blind natural forces. The working masses are opening up a new record in human history, obtaining their true, not illusory, freedom, working and creating for their own benefit, and gradually producing the material conditions to achieve thorough and universal happiness. This struggle is extremely arduous, but no force in the world can stop its progress, because the laws of human development have stipulated the inevitable universal victory of the proletariat." The newspaper also commented on the Soviet Union's national defense, saying, "The world knows that the Red Army is the best army in the world today. The Red Army's armaments are the result of the high efficiency achieved by our country's industry. The excellence of the Red Army's organization is also the result of the unique organizational strength and skills of the Soviet proletariat and its party. The superiority of the military training of Red Army officers and soldiers is the result of a great cultural force, which was aroused from the Soviet workers and peasants by the October Revolution. The heroic spirit of the Red Army is also the result of the Communist Party's policy of socialist industrialization and collectivization, which has aroused the fighting spirit of Soviet workers and collective farmers. As for the unity of Red Army soldiers, it is also a product of the proletariat dictatorship crushing all domestic class enemies." The newspaper continued, "The failure of the disarmament conference and the arms race currently underway both indicate that a new world imperialist war is imminent. Fascist adventurers are trying to direct the tide of war towards the Soviet Union, but their hope of forming an anti-Soviet united front and isolating the Soviet Union has become a bubble. The internal contradictions of the imperialist powers are extremely deep, so any far-sighted person must understand this truth, that the outbreak of war, no matter where it is, will undoubtedly become a world war. As for the Soviet giant, it is always calm and vigilant in the face of the waves crashing on its shores. It already knows the greatness of its strength and can deal with and thoroughly defeat its enemies with ease. It also understands that the stronger its strength, the more friends it will gain in the struggle for peace and self-defense. It does not need war to achieve its own goals, so it implements a firm policy of peace, and at the same time, it will definitely work together with countries that do not like war to help them."

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Arrives in Rome</h3>
<p>Rome: Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös arrived here yesterday from Vienna. Newspapers have lengthy commentaries on Gömbös's trip, saying that the friendship between Italy and Hungary can coexist with the improvement of Italy's relations with the Little Entente countries. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>Radical Socialists Reject Compromise, Doumergue Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>Five Cabinet Members Have Already Submitted Resignations</p>
<p>Budget Bill Certain to Fail in Parliament</p>
<p>[Paris] According to political observers, the conflict between Prime Minister Doumergue and the Radical Socialist Party is beyond repair and will inevitably break down at Thursday's cabinet meeting. According to "Le Matin," the situation at yesterday's cabinet meeting took a sudden turn. Herriot told the Prime Minister that he and other Radical Party cabinet members could not agree with the Prime Minister's proposal. The Prime Minister replied that those who disagreed should withdraw from the cabinet. The situation became tense. Herriot asked the Prime Minister whether he would fire them, which was resolved by President Lebrun. The meeting adjourned without result. Radical Party members passed a resolution yesterday rejecting the Prime Minister's budget bill, which will aggravate the situation. Laval is currently the most likely to succeed Doumergue in forming a new government. There are concerns about a repeat of the riots in February of this year, and the police authorities have taken special precautions to prevent any eventuality. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] It is widely believed that the French government will be overthrown tomorrow. According to reports from the Paris correspondents of "The Evening Standard" and "The Daily Mail," if the French government falls tomorrow, there will be serious civilian demonstrations in France. Five Radical Socialist Party cabinet members have submitted their resignations to the French President. The President said that their resignations would not be considered valid until tomorrow. The split in the French cabinet was caused by Prime Minister Doumergue's request that parliament discuss the fundraising bill. The House of Representatives is scheduled to meet tomorrow to debate the bill. The Radical Socialist Party strongly opposes this bill, so it is expected to be rejected. Therefore, Prime Minister Doumergue will have no choice but to resign and retire. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The House of Representatives met today, and the Doumergue cabinet is on the verge of collapse. An Associated Press reporter interviewed members of parliament and learned that most of the Radical Socialist Party members will vote against the Prime Minister's budget and constitutional reform bills when he proposes them. Unless something unexpected happens, Doumergue's failure is inevitable if he insists on presenting the monthly budget bill and the constitutional amendment bill at the same time, so that to agree with the former is to agree with the latter. Six Radical Socialist Party cabinet members submitted their resignations to the Prime Minister tonight. As soon as the Prime Minister proposes the reform bill, they will resign. This can also be seen as a harbinger of what kind of result the government will get in the House of Representatives. Those who submitted their resignations tonight are:</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister and current Minister without Portfolio Herriot,</p>
<p>Minister of Education Bedaud,</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior Marchandeau,</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Shipping Bedelin,</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture Queuille,</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce Lamoureux,</p>
<p>The Prime Minister asked them not to publish their resignations so as not to affect the memorial service for former President Poincaré when the House of Representatives meets. However, the Prime Minister seems determined to proceed with the budget plan. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Urgent Meeting of the Radical Socialist Party Group</h3>
<p>Decision to Maintain the Truce Principle</p>
<p>Proposal of Compromise Methods to the Prime Minister</p>
<p>[Paris] The Radical Socialist Party group of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting today and elected the party group chairman. (The former chairman, former Prime Minister Chautemps, has now been transferred to the Senate.) The outside world attaches great importance to the meeting. Regarding the successor to the party group chairman, former Prime Minister Daladier was originally the most promising candidate. However, Mr. Daladier has now declared that he will definitely not submit his candidacy, not only now but also in a week's time, etc. The party group then decided to postpone the election of the chairman. Outside interpretation of the postponement is that if Herriot regains freedom of action (referring to leaving the cabinet), he may be willing to preside over the party group again, so a way out is specially reserved. Mr. Herriot and other Radical Socialist cabinet members attended the meeting today. Mr. Herriot explained Premier Doumergue's constitutional reform plan and the provisional budget案, saying that the two proposals have not yet been submitted to the secretariat of the Chamber of Deputies. However, in order to enable the party group to understand the government's intentions for discussion, he first explained them. Recently, this party held a general meeting in the city of Landes, and agreed to maintain the status quo regarding the president's right to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies. Mr. Herriot also suggested that he and other cabinet members temporarily withdraw from the venue so as not to hinder the party group's discussion and its decision. This proposal was not accepted by the party group. Later, Interior Minister Marchandeau explained that once a political incident breaks out, under the current circumstances, 　陰殊　. He believed that constitutional reform is a good thing, and after the constitutional conference, it will be able to formulate the wording of constitutional amendments, so as to give the government sufficient authority and stabilize its position, etc. Subsequently, Marville, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, applied for the deputies to adopt a compromise attitude. At this point, the party group held a lengthy discussion, in which Radical Party cabinet members also participated. As a result, a motion was passed to explain that (1) the Radical Party maintains the party truce cabinet and requires other parties to act similarly; (2) the 1935 budget案 will be voted on quickly, while the provisional budget案 will be reserved, hoping that Premier Doumergue will accept it; (3) the constitutional reform案 can be accepted by the party group, but reservations are raised regarding the right to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies without seeking the consent of the Senate. Almost all of those who voted in favor of the motion. The party group adjourned at more than 7:00 in the evening.</p>
<p>[Paris] Tonight, the Radical Party held a meeting and passed a resolution to maintain the party truce. The government was able to obtain temporary security because of this, but Doumergue's resignation may not be avoided after all. The Radical Party expressed its willingness to submit the budget案 to a vote as soon as possible, without demanding fundraising again, and sent Herriot, a minister without portfolio, to meet with the society to ask them to accept this compromise method. However, according to well-informed sources, the prime minister will definitely refuse to accept it. The Chamber of Deputies has scheduled to start debating fundraising issues on Thursday. If the government does not fall by then, it must be protected by divine power. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Senate Passes Motion Against Constitutional Reform Plan</h3>
<p>[Paris] The Radical Party's attitude against the Prime Minister's reform plan and other proposals can be seen in today's Senate meeting. Senators passed a motion with 96 votes against 2, declaring that depriving the Senate of its special powers regarding the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies is dangerous. Since the Radical Party accounts for a majority of the senators, and now opposes Doumergue's constitutional reform, a storm will inevitably be caused when the Congress is convened to approve the Prime Minister's proposal in the future. According to the Prime Minister's constitutional reform proposal, which has been approved by a majority of the cabinet, the main points are (1) limiting the number of cabinet members to 20, including the Prime Minister; (2) the President may dissolve the Chamber of Deputies in accordance with the following law: (A) within the first year of establishment, the consent of the Senate must be obtained before it can be dissolved; (B) the consent of the Senate is not required after the first year; (3) guaranteeing the positions of civil servants to avoid being forcibly dismissed. At that time, Radical Party cabinet members had declared that they would reserve their attitude towards the issue of dissolving the Chamber of Deputies (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] In addition to the Radical Socialist Party group, the left-wing 　　Party, the People's Democratic Party, and the left-wing Republican Party groups in the Chamber of Deputies have all unanimously expressed their confidence in Premier Doumergue. However, the Republican Democratic Party members opposed the provisional budget案, believing it was useless. As for the 　left-wing Socialist Party and the Communist Party, they regarded Doumergue's constitutional reform案 as "汎繫主義之　　" and of course expressed hostility (Havas, 6th).</p>
<h3>Inevitable Resignation of Doumergue, Speculation on Candidates to Succeed Him</h3>
<p>[Paris] If a cabinet crisis occurs and Premier Doumergue resigns, the person who can succeed in forming a cabinet and reconcile the parties is either Senate Speaker Jeanneney or Chamber of Deputies Speaker Bouisson. If these two are unwilling to take on this important task, then Foreign Minister Laval is expected to come forward and form a cabinet (Havas, 7th).</p>
<p>[Paris] It is reported that after a meeting of Radical Party members of Congress this afternoon, Herriot and other Radical Party cabinet members will submit their resignations. If this happens, then Herriot, Minister of Navy Pietri, Minister of Public Works Flandin, etc. will form a cabinet. The new cabinet will be the same as the current cabinet, except without Doumergue. The Prime Minister has requested to raise funds of 1,362,800,000 francs in the first quarter of 1935, because his budget based on the order to reduce official salaries and pensions has not yet been submitted to Congress (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<h3>Situation on the First Day of the French Congress Meeting</h3>
<p>Speaker Praises Poincaré's Achievements</p>
<p>Leftists Make Strange Noises to Show Ridicule</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies met today to dedicate eulogies to the late King Alexander of Yugoslavia, former French Foreign Minister Barthou, and former Premier Poincaré. When Speaker Bouisson delivered his speech, all the deputies stood up to pay their respects, but the Communist Party deputies remained seated. When the Speaker praised Poincaré's patriotism, they shouted strange noises to show their ridicule. When Premier Doumergue delivered his eulogy, not only the Communist Party but also most of the orthodox Socialist Party deputies did not stand up to show their opposition. After the meeting, most of the deputies gathered in the government seats and asked Minister without Portfolio Herriot questions. Most of them were members of the Finance Committee. Judging from the excited conversation between Mr. Herriot and Jacques, the rapporteur of the Finance Committee, former Finance Minister Milles, and Finance Minister Germain-Martin, it can be seen that Mr. Herriot has presented his views on the provisional budget案 to the people (Havas, 6th).</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Crisis Affects Financial Markets</h3>
<p>[London] The French Doumergue cabinet is on the verge of collapse, so panic has risen again in Europe today. Paris bought British pounds and US dollars. Fortunately, the United States used its exchange equalization fund to buy a large number of francs, in order to prevent the excessive appreciation of the US dollar, resulting in a steady flow of gold into New York. Otherwise, the franc would become weaker and weaker. The French cabinet crisis is now causing concern, fearing that the riots that occurred in Paris on February 6 this year will be seen again in the future, and the Saar plebiscite is also a cause for unease. People here believe that the current situation requires a strong government. However, at present, it seems difficult to obtain such a strong government. It is still doubtful whether Belgium can maintain its gold standard. Its three-month bills are now discounted at 42 centimes. Due to the above-mentioned circumstances, more and more money is flowing into London. The move by banks to reduce the minimum interest rate on loans to five thousandths has now aroused rumors in the stock exchange and other places that the Bank of England's discount rate will be reduced to 1.5%, although this rate has never been used by the Bank of England. However, the current interest rate is indeed too high (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<h3>Spain's Wounds Have Not Healed, Political Situation Is Uneasy Again</h3>
<p>Trade Unions Announce General Strike</p>
<p>Congress Expresses Confidence in the Current Cabinet</p>
<p>Madrid: Spain has experienced internal turmoil in recent weeks, and the wounds have not yet healed. Tonight, the leader of the trade unionist faction announced a general strike, and the political situation is once again uneasy. This strike is to protest the execution tomorrow of the two leaders who instigated the last rebellion (National Telegram, 6th).</p>
<p>Madrid: Today, the Parliament expressed confidence in the current Lerroux cabinet with 233 votes. However, the monarchists participated in the voting, and the leftists did not attend. Moreover, the theory that the trade unionist faction is inciting turmoil is sufficient to promote the unity of the deputies (National Telegram, 7th).</p>
<h3>Air Obstacle Race between England and Australia</h3>
<p>Australian Youth Luckily Wins Second Place Prize Money</p>
<p>Melbourne: The second place prize of £1,000 in this air obstacle race between England and Australia was won by Australian youth Melrose. Mr. Mears' plane arrived 14 minutes earlier than the plane driven by Stodart, so he was lucky to win the prize. Stodart submitted a protest today, saying that he lost about 24 minutes at the Alor Setar station in Malaya. Otherwise, he could have arrived earlier than Melrose, because at that time he was forced to wade through the mud to the location where the time was checked, and the staff at the Alor Setar airfield miscalculated his time to Singapore. All of this was not his fault, so the second place prize should not be given to Melrose. According to reports, Melrose was originally the third place in the obstacle race, but because Scott and Black, who won the speed race championship, could no longer receive the prize of £2,000 for the obstacle race championship, this money was given to Dutch aviators Parmentier and Moll, who won the obstacle race runner-up. Because of this, Melrose won the runner-up prize of £1,000, otherwise he would not have received a penny (Reuters, 7th).</p>
<h3>Veteran of the French Navy, Vice Admiral Fournier, Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Paris] Vice Admiral Fournier passed away today at the age of 92. Mr. Fournier served in China from 1865 to 1868. When the Franco-Prussian War began, Mr. Fournier returned to his country to join the army and made many achievements. In 1878, he was appointed as the commander of a gunboat and went to China again, traveling along the Bai River to Tianjin and successfully negotiating with local officials. In 1891, he was promoted to Rear Admiral and Commander of the Vietnam Fleet. Within a few years, he was promoted to Vice Admiral and appointed as the General Inspector of the Navy. He retired in 1917 due to old age and lived leisurely in the mountains and forests. Another veteran of the French Navy has passed away (Havas, 6th).</p>

<h3>It is Hoped that the Remnant Bandits in the Border Area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Can Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>The Armies Encircle and Suppress in Several Routes, Leaving Only a Thousand Remnants</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Tours the Border Area of Henan and Hubei to Prepare for Relief</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The remnant bandits, the false 25th and 28th armies, in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have been fleeing and have not been completely wiped out for a long time. Last month, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Hankou, convened military generals, and held a military conference. A new plan was decided to completely eliminate them within three months. Shangguan Yunxiang was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the pursuit and suppression, responsible for the pursuit and suppression, and the rest of the armies were responsible for intercepting. After the generals returned to their defenses, they implemented it effectively. In less than a month, the bandit forces collapsed. There were only more than 3,000 remnants left, who lacked weapons, ammunition, and food. They fled in the territory of Yingshan, Luoshan, Lihuang, and Huoshan to avoid the pursuit of the national army. On the 28th of last month, the bandits entrenched in Taojiahe, northeast of Yingshan. After Shangguan Yunxiang led his troops to suppress them, more than 500 bandits were killed in the battle of Ta'ergang. The remnant bandits fled north overnight, and were repeatedly intercepted by the Xing Liu brigades of the 11th Route Army, and were in a state of embarrassment. On the night of the 3rd of this month, the bandits fled to Hongqishan, southwest of Lihuang County, and attempted to flee west from Shuiweizi and Laofoshan. They were again caught up by the Hao detachment of the national army, and joined forces with the garrison of the 25th Route Army to attack. More than 500 bandits were killed in Shuiweizi, and the bandits' luggage and equipment, as well as the women's team and other teams, were dispersed. Only more than 1,000 remnant bandits broke through and fled to the Nanshi Luan Nihu area. Zhang Xueliang, seeing that the suppression of the bandits had been successful, took a special train on the Pinghan Railway to Huangchuan on the 1st to inspect, and convened the generals to instruct them on the opportunity to encircle and suppress in several routes, so as to eliminate them within the deadline, and at the same time prepare for the aftermath of the bandit area, and actively engage in the work of recruiting and accommodating, so as not to leave the refugees homeless. He then toured Huang'an, Macheng, Songbu, Futianhe and other places, and inspected He Zhuguo's department Niu Yuanfeng's division. He returned to Hankou on the 5th and arrived late at night. It is heard that the remnant bandits in the border area have indeed disintegrated, and it is hoped that they will be wiped out soon (6th).</p>
<h3>After the Wuhu-Tunxi Road Opens to Traffic, Zhejiang and Anhui Passenger Cars Will Be Connected</h3>
<p>—The Anhui Construction Department is Preparing for the Wuhu-Tunxi Road Exhibition—</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The roadbed and crushed stone pavement project of the Wuhu-Tunxi (Wuhu to Tunxi) highway in Anhui Province has now been completely completed. The entire road is more than 250 kilometers long and is handled by the Provincial Highway Bureau itself. Twenty long-distance passenger cars of Fadaer and Lihua brands were purchased. On the 1st of this month, tickets were sold in advance and passenger transport was trial-operated. The official opening ceremony will be held on New Year's Day next year. The Construction Department believes that traffic between Wuhu and Huizhou was extremely inconvenient in the past, and it was necessary to spend half a month to travel back and forth. Now, it only takes eight hours to reach directly, and the counties in Huizhou and the places along the way, such as Xuancheng, Ningguo, and Jixi, are rich in products. In order to prosper commerce and revitalize rural areas, it was decided to hold an exhibition of goods along the Wuhu-Tunxi Road on the day of the opening ceremony, so as to arouse public attention to the relationship between highways and industry, commerce, rural areas, and culture. The exhibition period is tentatively set for one month. If necessary, it can be rescheduled or extended. The exhibition is of a mobile nature and will be held in Wuhu, Xuancheng, Ningguo, Jixi, Shexian, Tunxi and other cities and towns in turn. Each place is limited to five days. The location will be borrowed from the local Chamber of Commerce or other suitable places. Preparations are now underway to actively prepare and it is expected that the future will be very effective.</p>
<p>The Construction Department believes that in addition to the Hangzhou-Huizhou Road, the Tunxi Highway, another transportation artery connecting southern Anhui and Zhejiang, can also directly reach Jiande Lanxi Chun'an and other counties in Zhejiang Province. Moreover, merchants in southern Anhui have long been trading with Chun'an Jian and other counties in Zhejiang Province. In the past, when the Tunxi Road was not open, passengers had to detour through Hangzhou and then follow the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, which was inconvenient in terms of both time and economy. Therefore, Wang Tiesheng was recently sent to Zhejiang to discuss the direct traffic between the two provinces. The procedures for mutual interconnection have now been identified. During the period when the two provinces are submitting for approval, the vehicles of the two provinces have been pre-connected, opening four times a day, and meeting at the provincial border in front of the Jiekou Tudimiao (6th).</p>
<h3>Record of an Inspection in the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Passing Yumen and Arriving at Anxi</p>
<p>Traveling fifteen or sixteen li west from Chijin Fort, we crossed the Chijin River. The water came from the southern mountains, with fine sand mixed in the flow, appearing reddish-brown. We passed through the five-li Chijin Gorge, where residents lived scattered in about thirty or so households. When asked if this place produced gold, they replied that it was once said gold sand could be found in the river, but now no one dredged for it. They said that many people go to the Qilian Mountains to pan for gold every year. Afterward, we passed through the Gobi Desert, which stretched for sixty or seventy li, until we gradually saw village trees as we approached Yumen County. The city perimeter was only about three li. Entering through the south gate, above which was inscribed "Obstructing the Barbarian Hordes," we turned diagonally out of the north gate. Inside the city, the houses were closely packed, and the streets were short and narrow. There were several old poplar trees, with circumferences exceeding five chi. The walls of the houses on both sides were squeezed as if about to collapse. It is said that they were planted by Nian Gengyao during his western expedition, making them ancient relics of nearly three hundred years. The county government gate looked more like a shop front. The clothing of the men and women was not very tattered, and we did not see children without clothes. The women's figures were also quite healthy and graceful. This was due to two reasons: first, during the Tongzhi Rebellion, most of the cities in Longxi were burned to the ground, but this place was fortunately spared; second, the forests were dense, the water channels were open, and the land near the suburbs was quite fertile. The so-called essence of the Gobi finally had such a good appearance. There is an ancient poem that goes, "The Qiang flute need not resent the willow trees, for the spring breeze does not pass through Yumen Pass." (Note: The ancient Yumen Pass was still one hundred and twenty li northwest of Dunhuang.) Today, people also say, "Once you leave Jiayu Pass, even a sow looks like Diaochan." Based on current facts, these are all inaccurate poetic sayings.</p>
<p>A few li outside the city, we saw the Gobi Desert again, stretching for forty or fifty li, until we reached a large village called Sandaogou, which belonged to Anxi County. There were three hundred or so households, mostly Han and Hui people. There were only two or three families of "Turbaned Heads" (Uighurs) who had recently moved from Xinjiang. Shops displayed goods from Baotou and Xinjiang, and the trade was still considerable, far better than in Anxi City itself. There was a type of mineral called "Hanshui Stone," transported from Changma Mountain, which was burned with coal and suddenly turned into snow-white powder as fine as dust. It could be used to extract pigments, but the residents only used it for mending cracks and plastering walls, which was a great pity. We met two people returning from Dihua, one surnamed Zhou from Hunan, with his family of two, and one surnamed Yang from Shanhaiguan. They both said that the journey to Xinjiang was very difficult. Many of the former post stations had been demolished, and one often had to travel hundreds of li to find food and lodging. The section from Hami to Guchengzi was even more devastated by Ma Zhongying. Merchants passing through had to be cautious and travel in groups, otherwise, they would likely be attacked by Kazakhs (also a type of native Xinjiang people, similar to Turbaned Heads, but more barbaric). The Kazakhs would first lie in wait in the grass, fire a shot, and then swarm to rob and kill. The bullets they fired were not steel balls but tin pellets. They said that one pellet could hit a rabbit, and the price of the skinned rabbit was only worth two dimes. But if they used it to hit a person, no matter what, the gain would be more than the value of a rabbit skin.</p>
<p>After lunch, we continued westward. The water and grass along the way were lush, and the soil was loose, but the villages were sparse, and the land was wasted, which was a great pity. The only transportation route between Gansu and Xinjiang was also overgrown with grass. Only where the horses' hooves stepped and the wheels rolled left slight traces, forming a "川" (river) shape. If even this were gone, travelers would have no signs to follow and would surely get lost in the overgrown wilderness. After twenty or so li, we crossed a shallow river. The evening glow reflected beautifully, and with a sudden gust of wind, the earth was enveloped in night. Unable to reach the next station, we had to spend the night in an old temple. From Huihuibao to Yumen, the distance was fifty-one kilometers, about one hundred and fifty-three li. From Yumen to this place, the old temple near Liudaogou, the distance was twenty-one kilometers, about sixty-three li, totaling seventy-two kilometers, two hundred and sixteen li.</p>
<p>The old temple was surrounded by red willows (the branches and leaves were similar to junipers, but thinner, with spike-shaped red flowers, which southerners call Guanyin willows, and Westerners call beautiful). Inside were two white poplars, one with a straight trunk, rising three or four zhang, and the other with lush leaves and dense branches, spreading like an umbrella canopy, standing opposite the temple. They could be seen from dozens of li away. There was no response to our knocking. We could only glimpse the flickering Buddhist lamp in the main hall through the crack in the door. When the car first arrived, we vaguely saw someone running away, presumably the abbot of the temple, who had misunderstood and fled. At that time, the drizzle was fine, and the wind and sand were fierce, making it difficult to camp in the open. So we broke the lock and entered. The temple corridor leaked in the corners. Besides a few broken cotton wads and earthenware jars, it was empty. Pushing open the door of the main hall, we illuminated the Buddha statue with a flashlight. We first saw Zhou Cang holding a large knife, knowing it was a Guan Yu Temple. Wild pigeons nested among the beams and rafters, flapping and flying in surprise, numbering over a hundred. They then landed on the trees in the courtyard, bending the branches. The cook seized a few and was about to cook them, but then thought he might be punished by the gods, so he let them go. The next morning, we met a shepherd who said the pigeons were very old and would be difficult to swallow even if cooked. When the car manager, Mr. Tan, left, seeing that the temple master had not yet returned, he specially used a new lock to lock the temple door and gave the shepherd an empty kerosene barrel, instructing him to hand over the key to the new lock to the temple master. This shows that outsiders do not cheat people over small matters, and also leaves room to avoid being driven away on a future visit.</p>
<p>We traveled through the grassland in the morning, passing the Qidaogou Yao Station. In the past, it provided food and lodging, but now only ruined walls and old poplars remain, sighing in the wind. After about fifty li, we reached Bulongji City. Along the way, we saw many pools of water and lush grass, which were ideal for reclamation and animal husbandry. Occasionally, we encountered dangerous places, but there was also water and grass. Cultivating crops should be harmless. The city of Bulongji had a perimeter of about six li. During the Qing Dynasty, in the Yongzheng period, troops were stationed here to cultivate land. The Anxi garrison also established a horse farm here. There were more than ten white poplars, with tall branches shading the sun and thick shade covering the ground, about four or five armfuls in circumference, with numbered cloth signs hanging on them, reading "Planted by General Nian." The original population was seven or eight hundred households, but now only one-tenth remains. The burden on farmers and merchants has increased daily, and there are frequent reports of fleeing households, all unable to bear the exploitation of taxes. Those who do not flee are mostly impoverished. I saw small vendors selling melons, fruits, needles, and thread, setting up stalls on the spot. Women and children each held tobacco pipes, bartering for apricots. Seeing this situation, I couldn't help but feel sad for the villagers.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we continued our journey. After thirty-some li, we crossed the Kulong River, which is the ancient Hulu River. There was an ancient city, the former site of the Tang Dynasty's Yumen Pass. Slightly west was Shuangtabao, the former site of the Tang Dynasty's Guazhou Jinchang County. However, there were also few residents, presenting a desolate scene. After passing the fort, we traveled uphill for about ten li. The north and south mountains stood opposite each other, with a high mound on the north mountain and twin pagodas soaring into the sky on the south mountain, a magnificent natural formation, the origin of which is unknown. The river here curved around, and the vegetation was lush. Suddenly, the mountains rose and fell, and the northern branch stretched out again. The road ran along the northern foot of the south mountain for thirty-some li, reaching Xiaowanzi, where we stayed for the night. That day, we traveled thirty-eight kilometers, about one hundred and fourteen li.</p>
<p>Xiaowanzi had abundant water and fertile soil, and many farmers lived there in the past. Now, due to heavy donations, many have abandoned their fields and fled. This spring, a middle-class household surnamed Wang took their family and tried to escape. The village head, fearing that it would increase the burden on those who did not flee, chased them back. Wang said he had no seeds or oxen for plowing. The village head, originally a wealthy household, generously lent them to him. They barely managed to survive until autumn, and then fled again secretly at night. They had not harvested wheat and had abandoned their furniture, catching everyone off guard, so they were not caught. The abandoned houses were complete and habitable. Although the doors were open, the earthen stoves, large jars, tables, stools, and even coffins prepared for the elderly were all intact. Only the earthen pit bed had been broken by neighbors for fertilizer. (The earthen pit bed, because people slept on it and the underside was smoked with dung grass, was replaced every year and could be used as fertilizer.) I was awakened in the middle of the night by a sudden noise. I asked and learned that Zhang Wenrui and the cook had been sleeping in a low-lying area, and the water from the canal had overflowed in the middle of the night, soaking all the bedding. Zhang and others had worked hard during the day and were snoring under their quilts until they were completely wet and cold, then they woke up and shouted in confusion, claiming that "the quilts weighed a thousand catties and they had no strength to move them." They then lit a fire to keep warm and left at dawn. After seventy li, we arrived at Anxi, and were distressed that there was no hotel to stay in. We happened to meet a friend, Fan Yuancen, who was the current head of the Anxi Special Tax Bureau, and he insisted on inviting us to stay in the bureau. The bureau was located in the Sichuan Guild Hall, which was clean, spacious, and comfortable. Finding this in the remote desert was truly fortunate.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Grass House Fire at Jingjia Weir</p>
<p>Guan Dazi, a resident of the northern shantytown in Songjiang, lived in a grass house built in Jingjia Weir with his wife, Guan Chen, and their two-year-old child. He worked as a laborer to support his family. Today (the 7th) at 4 p.m., a welcoming deity parade passed by. Spectators threw cigarette butts onto the grass house. The crowd did not pay attention. After a while, a spark ignited the entire area. Neighbors were shocked and quickly reported to the police, who relayed the message to the fire brigades in each district. They used water pumps to extinguish the fire, preventing it from spreading to neighboring houses. However, Guan Dazi, after receiving the news, was unable to rush into the grass house. Therefore, his two-year-old child was buried in the flames. Those who heard this felt deeply saddened.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Child Run Over and Killed by Shangnan Bus</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., a northbound bus of the Shangnan Long-Distance Bus Company was traveling through Shenjia Bridge in Sanlintang when a child suddenly ran out from the side of the road and crossed the tracks. The driver saw this but was unable to brake in time, resulting in the child being run over and killed instantly. The child's family negotiated with the company and settled the matter with a compensation of twenty yuan.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Establishment of the County Land Bureau</p>
<p>The Wu County Land Bureau, in preparation for over a year, was officially established yesterday (the 7th). The bureau is located at the former Wu County government site on Heng Street. The director is Shen Shike. There are three sections: the General Affairs Section Chief is Zhao Tinggan, the Technical Section Chief is Pei Guanxi, and the Registration Section Chief is concurrently held by Director Shen. The Survey Team Leader is also Pei Guanxi. Staff members for each section have also been announced.</p>
<p>National Exhibition to Open as Scheduled</p>
<p>Merchants of domestic goods, led by Sun Zicheng, organized the Wu County National Goods Mobile Exhibition, scheduled to open on the 10th. However, merchants from Guanqian Street, such as Tu Haoquan and Wu Jiyuan, believed that the timing, near winter, was particularly related to the business in Guanqian Street, so they resolutely opposed it. They petitioned the County Chamber of Commerce and the County Party Headquarters, demanding that the exhibition be stopped. The County Party Headquarters, having already given permission beforehand, could not agree. Moreover, among the petitioning merchants, most also sold foreign goods, which was not in line with promoting domestic goods. The County Chamber of Commerce, wanting to please both sides, suggested only exhibiting and not moving the exhibition. However, the National Goods Mobile Exhibition did not stop due to the opposition and continued to actively prepare. Over fifty council members from domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai arrived in Suzhou yesterday afternoon (the 7th). They were scheduled to host a banquet for the press at noon on the 8th, and to hold a meeting of factory representatives in the afternoon to select venues. On the 9th, they would invite various agencies to assess the domestic goods. The opening was still scheduled for the 10th. The opening ceremony would be held in the morning, and the mobile exhibition would begin in the afternoon. It was also rumored that the opposition might express their views in writing at the opening.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Reporters Association Questions Zhang Yu</p>
<p>Pan Kui, a reporter for the Xinmin Daily in this county, was detained by Zhang Yu, the chief of the Public Security First Sub-Bureau, for allegedly defrauding money while paying a fine on behalf of someone at the bureau. He was also subjected to illegal abuse. The case has now been transferred to the court, and Prosecutor Lian has ordered Pan Kui to be released on bail of two hundred yuan. Yesterday, the News Reporters Association of this county stated that if Pan's fraud was true, it would not only violate criminal law but also bring shame to the industry. It would be difficult to forgive him legally and ethically. They would wait quietly for the court to handle the case and first suspend his membership. However, they raised four questions regarding Zhang Yu's leading others to commit crimes and his illegal abuse: 1. The original judgment by the bureau in the case of Mo Zhongying was a fine of eight yuan, but Zhang suddenly changed it to five yuan based on Pan's words. This was either listening to solicitations or deliberately showing favoritism. Then, suddenly, he changed his attitude and treated Pan like an enemy, subjecting him to abuse outside the law. Was there any other key element in this? This is question one. 2. Listening to solicitations, exaggerating or suppressing cases, is absolutely impermissible for public officials. Now, the chief of the sub-bureau changed the judgment by selling favors. His crime is greater than soliciting tariffs. In fact, it promoted Pan's commission of a crime. Considering the chief's sudden change in attitude from respectful to disdainful, wasn't it deliberately setting a trap to induce crime? This is question two. 3. The chief of the bureau inflicted freezing torture and illegal abuse, which is not seen in our country's old or new laws. Is it recorded in the special violation penalty law made by the chief? This is question three. 4. Modern criminal law emphasizes reform, rewards repentance, prohibits abuse, encourages self-renewal, and has provisions for probation. Pan Kui's crime, in terms of sentiment, should be treated with leniency, and sending him for prosecution, in terms of fact, does not cause concern about escape. Why did you uniquely bind him with hemp rope, like a major thief, causing the audience to laugh and leaving a permanent stain? Such abuse of power to satisfy personal desires, please answer question four. We respectfully request a reply today.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Fifteen Homes Robbed in Ergou Town</p>
<p>Ergou Town, thirty li from the city, is a prosperous commercial center. Unexpectedly, last night, seventeen or eighteen bandits, each armed with firearms, landed from a boat on the western Renzi River and extensively searched and robbed fifteen shops, including Maochang Egg Shop. After two hours, they fled with their loot, also stealing a newly built boat from the Doutian Temple in the town. The total loss was estimated to be over four thousand yuan. It was heard that Maochang Egg Shop, Yitaiyuan Grocery Store, and the Pan family suffered the greatest losses.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Farmers Kidnapped in Youbang Village</p>
<p>Last night, eight or nine bandits suddenly came to Youbang Village in the fourth district of this county. They arrived in a bandit boat, broke into the home of farmer Huang Shunfu, and bound all the family members. They ransacked the boxes and cabinets, looting everything. Before leaving, they kidnapped Huang Shunfu and his cousin, Huang Xiaoqi. When the nearby people heard the noise and tried to apprehend them, the bandits had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Haimen Sojourners Association in Beijing Opposes Dredging the Tongsha River</p>
<p>The Haimen Sojourners Association in Beijing, concerning Chen Baochu of Nantong's proposal to dredge the Tongsha River, which runs directly through the three counties of Tonghai and Qi, telegraphed its opposition yesterday. The original telegram stated, "Recently, we read in the newspapers of this county that Chen Baochu of Nantong, in conjunction with the gentry of Tonghai and Qi counties, is proposing to dredge the Tongsha River to expedite the drainage of Nantong. If the people of our Hai and Qi counties rashly agree, it would be tantamount to turning our Hai and Qi counties into marshlands. In the second year of the Republic of China, Zhang Jian of Nantong proposed to dredge the Tongsha River in the Provincial Assembly, but the people of the county strongly opposed it, and the decision was overturned, prohibiting dredging. The iron case of the former ministry is like a mountain and cannot be moved. Now we hear that Mr. Tan Juenong (the current head of the Construction Section of the County Government), a representative of Haimen, has actually agreed with Chen's proposal, arguing that dredging the river is beneficial and harmless. Unless he is insane, how could he say this? The sojourners in Beijing, considering the location of our ancestral graves, cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the people of the two counties lament over their fish. We unanimously oppose it and ask Mr. Tan to explain in detail the benefits of dredging the river and dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>Special Dispatch</p>
<h3>Implementation Report of Resolutions from the National Finance Conference</h3>
<p>Compiled by the Local Tax and Levy Consolidation Committee of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The efforts of various provinces and cities in abolishing excessive and miscellaneous levies, reducing local budgets, and consolidating land taxes have been reported to the nation in summaries. In recent months, progress has continued, yielding considerable results. Regarding the stamp tax collection method to compensate for revenue losses, postal offices will begin selling stamps starting in November, and inspection measures will be announced. If collection is effective in the future, tax revenue will increase, and sufficient funds will be available to compensate for the abolition of excessive levies, which should be even more significant. We now specially compile and list the key points for reference.</p>
<p>(I) Consolidating legitimate local taxes and levies is one of the important missions of this committee. Currently, based on the investigation of tax and levy situations in various provinces and cities, various consolidation plans are being drafted. Furthermore, the various tax and levy regulations reported by various provinces and cities are being carefully reviewed to formulate the types and scope of future local taxes and levies, aiming to eliminate all miscellaneous levies and achieve a unified tax system.</p>
<p>(II) Recently, most budget estimates from various provinces and cities have been submitted to the ministry in accordance with the revised budget regulations. The budget estimates of Nanjing City and Weihaiwei have been reviewed and completed by the ministry. The budget estimates of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces have also been submitted to the ministry successively. Various provinces are also reorganizing county-level budgets. For example, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Guizhou provinces have drafted county budget regulations, which have been reviewed by the ministry and implemented. In the future, the handling of county and city budgets by various provinces and cities should also have a standard to follow.</p>
<p>(III) Regarding the land declaration case, we recently received a copy of the implementation measures forwarded by the Hubei Provincial Government. It is planned to change the original land tax consolidation plan and handle it in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Executive Yuan. The official regulations will be sent to the ministry soon. In Fujian, all counties have been notified to handle it in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Executive Yuan. Even provinces that previously requested exemption from holding such as Jiangxi Province, have now replied to the provincial government, referring to the key points and sample forms issued by the ministry, and instructed the Finance Department and Land Bureau to comply. It seems that the important policy of land declaration can now be carried out uniformly throughout the country.</p>
<p>(IV) According to the resolution of the National Finance Conference, each province and city should establish a Tax and Levy Supervision Committee to supervise the implementation of the abolition of excessive levies and miscellaneous taxes. It is now planned to first organize in more than ten provinces and regions, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the future, it will provide greater assistance in promoting the implementation of the National Finance Conference resolutions.</p>
<p>Other resolutions on important cases are also being promoted separately by various provinces and cities, with considerable achievements. They will be announced successively to satisfy the public.</p>
<p>(II) Reform of the Stamp Tax System</p>
<p>The stamp tax is one of the important compensation measures for abolishing excessive levies and reducing surcharges. The Executive Yuan has decided on a revenue-sharing method, and the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly made active plans. However, according to past performance, this tax revenue needs to be improved in many aspects, and in remote and poor areas, it may involve excessive disturbance. Therefore, when implementing revenue-sharing to local areas, the stamp sales method will be reorganized and changed to postal offices as agents to prevent the evils of contracting and apportioning. Inspection measures will be stipulated to prevent under-stamping and missing stamps. If handled properly and inspected effectively in the future, the compensation to local areas will gradually become sufficient. (Note: The Ministry of Finance's announcement and inspection measures have been reported in newspapers and are omitted here.)</p>
<p>(III) Revision of Budget Regulations</p>
<p>Local budgets are a manifestation of the local financial situation. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for supervising local finance, and it should participate in the review in advance to improve it. The National Finance Conference recognized this and made a resolution to revise the budget regulations. The ministry has recently forwarded them to the National Government for promulgation and amendment. Article 42 of the original regulations has been changed to: "Each provincial and municipal government shall, based on the annual administrative plan and the principle of balancing revenue and expenditure, discuss and determine the draft budget for the province or city and return it to the Finance Department or Finance Bureau before January 31. If the total amount of estimated expenditures exceeds the total amount of estimated revenues, the provincial or municipal government shall discuss and determine remedial measures and submit them to the central government for approval." Article 43 has been changed to: "Each provincial Finance Department or municipal Finance Bureau shall, based on the annual administrative plan and draft budget discussed and determined by the provincial or municipal government, compile the total estimated revenue and expenditure for the province or city (i.e., the second-level budget) and submit five copies, along with the annual administrative plan, before February 15. One copy shall be sent to the Executive Yuan, one to the Ministry of Finance, and three copies, along with one copy of the first-level budget each, to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government. After receiving the second-level budget and administrative plan from each province and city, the Executive Yuan shall immediately convene a review meeting of the relevant ministries and commissions, prepare a written review opinion, and submit it to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval before March 15, and forward it to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government." Article 44 has been changed to: "The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government shall review the total estimated revenue and expenditure of each province and city, sign and comment on it, and submit two copies of the total estimated budget, along with one copy each of the review opinions of the Executive Yuan and the Directorate-General of Budget, before March 31, to the Central Political Council through the National Government." After this, local budgets can gradually enter the right track.</p>
<p>(IV) Summary of Provincial Reports</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province: The Ministry received a letter from the Jiangxi Provincial Finance Department reporting that the province's consolidation of county-level finance is based on unified revenue and expenditure and determined budgets as a starting point. All revenue and expenditure of each county is managed by the County Finance Committee and submitted to the Provincial Affairs Conference for discussion and resolution. All members of the committee and the director of the Security Department organize the County Local Budget Review Committee. All county budgets are compiled by each county and sent to the department, which conducts a preliminary review. For revenue, land tax surcharges are reduced, and excessive and miscellaneous taxes and levies are eliminated. For expenditure, redundant institutions are merged, redundant personnel are reduced, and all unnecessary or avoidable extravagant expenditures are eliminated. Unified collection and expenditure must be appropriate, and then submitted to the Provincial Government Local Budget Review Committee for review to ensure accuracy and detail. Once passed and decided, it will be forwarded to the provincial government for promulgation and compliance. The budgets of all counties in the province have now been submitted for approval, and according to another case report, the reduction of land tax surcharges is estimated to be more than 3 million, and the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes and levies is estimated to be more than 1 million.</p>
<p>Fujian Province: The Ministry continued to receive a letter from the Fujian Provincial Finance Department reporting that the province initially planned to implement county-level budgets after the establishment of finance bureaus. However, due to the intrusion of Red bandits in various places, it is temporarily difficult to abolish the group fee surcharge, and the responsibility of the county magistrate to collect taxes has not been clearly defined for the time being. Therefore, it is temporarily difficult to start county-level budgets. It is planned to wait until the situation is slightly stable, and first summon and train the financial personnel in the county as preparation for future budget compilation and review. In addition, ten implementation plans for consolidating land tax, four plans for consolidating deed tax, three implementation plans for consolidating slaughter tax, nine implementation plans for consolidating house and shop tax, four implementation plans for consolidating business tax, and seven notes for collecting business tax should be formulated and issued to various collection agencies for earnest implementation.</p>
<p>Hubei Province: The Ministry continued to receive a letter from the Hubei Provincial Finance Department reporting that the first batch of 27 types of commercial port levies, totaling 286,000 yuan, have been abolished, as detailed in the previous report. The county-level revenue and expenditure budgets for the 23rd year of each county have now been reviewed, approved, and implemented. In summary, the reduction of land tax surcharges includes 21 counties such as Wuchang, totaling 520,220 yuan. The abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes and levies includes 39 counties such as Puqi, with 62 tax items, totaling 451,948 yuan. The Wuxue commercial port continues to abolish two types of levies, the salt merchant donation and the pier tax, totaling approximately 250 yuan. The total reduction of the three items is 972,419 yuan. As for land tax surcharges exceeding the regular tax, due to the need for funds, it was temporarily impossible to reduce them. Excessive and miscellaneous taxes and levies related to education expenses that cannot be abolished temporarily before funding is obtained have been reduced in accordance with central regulations within a limited time and supervised to be reduced separately within the time limit. On the one hand, the county will formulate alternative compensation measures and submit them for approval and compliance. The rest are strictly reduced in the current year's budget of each county in order to implement the central government's purpose of reducing the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Suiyuan Province: The Ministry approved the telegram from Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, stating that Suiyuan Province is located in a remote area, and the people are struggling.

It is also planned to merge the four bureaus of each county into departments and continue to reduce redundant institutions, saving 340,000 yuan annually. The security regiments will gradually achieve a non-paid system, and the first year is planned to reduce a part of it, saving more than 100,000 yuan annually. For village apportionments, the county is ordered to earnestly supervise and eliminate the harassment of urging and demanding from the village officials. Village regiments rotate services without paying salaries, reducing recurring expenditures. By proceeding in this way, the burden on the people of Suiyuan can be reduced by at least 700,000 yuan this year. Regarding the original taxes and levies in Suiyuan Province that should be abolished, they include 13 items: Koubei Mongolian Salt, Food Household Donation, Kuai Donation, Coal Tax, Freight Tax, Oil Tax, Wugongba Road Construction Donation, Pig Bristle Donation, Public Debt Surcharge Charcoal Juice Donation, Boat and Raft Escort Fee, Office Fee Attached to Boat and Raft Escort, Jiancao Boat License Fee, and Nursery Expenses, totaling a reduction of more than 200,000 yuan in annual revenue.

Starting from October 1, the Nursery Expenses, Koubei Mongolian Salt Food Household Donation, Public Debt Surcharge Dou Donation, Pig Bristle Donation, and Oil Tax will be abolished. The rest will be handled on a scheduled basis. As for the donations and fees that should be abolished at the county level, the categories are numerous and closely related to the people's pain. The department is ordering the county bureaus to investigate and then separately verify the retention and abolition.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province: The Ministry received a letter from the Shaanxi Finance Commissioner stating that the Shaanxi Province should implement the abolition of excessive levies as resolved by the National Finance Conference in order to reduce the burden on the people.

The temporary mu tax apportionment in various counties and towns has also been strictly prohibited. Those that have been reduced now include Liling, Cili, Rucheng, Xinhua, Dayong, Qiyang, Chen County, Hengshan, and other counties, calculated according to the assessed amount, totaling approximately 390,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Banking Sector Discussed Loan to Shaanxi Province for Wei River Diversion Yesterday</h3>
<p>Total Amount of 1.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Guaranteed by Jing and Luo Water Conservancy Donations</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shaanxi Provincial Government is actively carrying out water conservancy construction throughout the province. Since the completion of the Jinghui and Luohui canals, farmland irrigation has been convenient. It is now planned to divert the Wei River to irrigate farmland and build the Weihui Canal. The required funds are 1.5 million yuan. After Yang Hucheng, the Pacification Director stationed in Shaanxi, came to Shanghai last time to negotiate a loan with the banking sector, the principles have been determined. The provincial government has sent Lei Baohua, Director of the Construction Department, to Shanghai to negotiate again. A contract will be signed soon. According to the reporter's inquiry, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Loan for Wei River Diversion</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province has suffered from drought for many years, and farmland has been abandoned. In order to actively promote construction, the provincial authorities have jointly formulated detailed plans with the National Economic Council to gradually improve water conservancy. The Jinghui and Luohui canals have been completed, and farmland irrigation has benefited greatly. It is now planned to guide the Wei River to build a gate, which is scheduled to be completed in the summer of the 25th year. The canal is 200 li long and can irrigate more than 7,000 hectares of farmland. The magnitude of the project and its relationship to farmers can be imagined.</p>
<p>Principles Determined</p>
<p>The provincial authorities are eager to proceed with the project, so Yang Hucheng once borrowed 1.5 million yuan from the bank in Shanghai, guaranteed by the Jing and Luo canals' water donations. The banking sector has agreed to the principles of the loan, but the use of water donations as a guarantee is still to be negotiated. Lei Baohua, Director of the Construction Department of Shaanxi Province, came to Shanghai and learned of this situation. He immediately telegraphed the province to send the water donation measures and the organizational rules and regulations of the collection agencies to Shanghai for the banking sector to study. It was sent yesterday.</p>
<p>Discussion of Measures</p>
<p>The banks then met at 11:00 AM yesterday at the third floor of the Central Bank to discuss the loan. Chen Xing of the Central Bank, Liu Tao of the Bank of China, Jin Guobao and Zhang Peishen of the Bank of Communications, Chen Liting of the Jincheng Bank, Chen Guangfu and Cheng Muhai of the Shanghai Bank, and others attended. Director Lei also attended the meeting and reported, and submitted the draft contract he brought to the representatives for discussion. After some modifications, it was handed over to the Central Bank to draft separately. At noon, Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, hosted a banquet for the representatives of the six banks at the Bank Club to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Contract Content</p>
<p>As for the contract content, according to the reporter's inquiry, the total loan amount is 1.5 million yuan, which will be underwritten by six banks including the Central Bank. However, the number of loans to be borne by each bank has not yet been determined. The loan period is from the end of the 25th year and will be repaid in installments until the end of the 28th year. The guarantee is the water donation from the Jinghui and Luohui canals. A Water Donation Supervision Committee will be organized with representatives from the bank to demonstrate credit. The loan interest rate has not yet been determined and will be discussed further. However, since the bank has no objection to the collateral and the contract is being drafted, the formal signing should not be far away.</p>
<h3>Lei Baohua, Director of the Shaanxi Construction Department, Talks About Shaanxi's Efforts in Construction</h3>
<p>People from the Southeast Eager to Invest and Development is Promising</p>
<p>Highways, Municipal Administration, Water Conservancy, and Electricity are Gradually Being Implemented</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Lei Baohua, Director of the Construction Department of Shaanxi Province, has been in Shanghai for several days to negotiate a loan for the Wei River diversion. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Lei at his residence. According to his conversation, various constructions in Shaanxi Province are being actively carried out. The Chinese people are now paying close attention to the construction in the Northwest and are working hard to assist. If it can proceed in an orderly manner, the future is very promising. The following is a transcript of his conversation:</p>
<p>Development is Promising</p>
<p>Director Lei first said that he had only been in Shaanxi for five months. Various constructions, such as the important highways in the province and the municipal administration of Xi'an, are all under the direction of the government and are being carried out diligently. People from all over the country, especially those from the southeastern provinces, have paid close attention to the construction in the Northwest in recent years and have benefited greatly from investing and developing there. This year, the province has had a bumper harvest, and the rural situation is better. We should focus on the priorities and proceed in an orderly manner. If we can give it some time, the future development will be very promising.</p>
<p>Highway Achievements</p>
<p>The most important construction in Shaanxi Province is highways, because transportation is blocked, the local areas are closed, and all construction is difficult to carry out. The Xianyu Road and the Fenglong Road are sponsored by the province. The former runs from Xianyang North to Yulin on the border of Sui, running through the province, with a length of more than 500 kilometers. The latter runs from Fengxiang to Long County on the border of Gansu, with a length of more than 130 kilometers. Both roads started construction two months ago and are under construction. Another highway from Hanzhong to Beihe, also more than 500 kilometers long, was ordered by Chairman Chiang to be built. The central government has allocated more than 900,000 yuan for expenses and will start construction soon.</p>
<p>Xi'an Municipal Administration</p>
<p>The municipal administration of Xi'an is also being actively carried out. Three important roads in the city have been completed. The original earth roads are now being rebuilt. It is planned to convert all important thoroughfares in the city into stone roads before February of next spring. The provincial government has also decided to establish the Xi'an Electric Power Co., Ltd., with the government and merchants each contributing 250,000 yuan as capital. A preparatory committee has been established, and the director of the Construction Department has been appointed to organize it with three gentry and merchants. Director Lei came south this time and brought an electrical expert with him. He will discuss purchasing the old capital power plant motor from the National Construction Commission. After his public affairs in Shanghai are completed, he will go to Beijing to negotiate. The machine can supply 750 kilowatts of electricity, which is sufficient for the city.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Construction</p>
<p>Director Lei also said that water conservancy construction in Shaanxi Province is very important. Since the provincial authorities and the National Economic Council have formulated detailed measures and proceeded gradually, the Jinghui and Luohui canals have been completed, irrigating more than one million mu of farmland. The provincial government will collect water conservancy donations according to the land and has decided to use this tax exclusively for water conservancy construction, so that water conservancy construction can be independent and proceed gradually. The drought, which is the most difficult thing in Shaanxi Province, can be avoided.</p>

<h3>Zhang Wuyuan and Others to be Sent by the Henan Provincial Government to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Investigate the Statistical Undertakings of Various Agencies in Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Henan Provincial Government was ordered to implement joint office, Chairman Liu is extremely eager to earnestly promote statistical undertakings throughout the province. In addition to establishing a statistical office in accordance with the general outline of joint office and actively planning for implementation, he is also puzzled by the fact that the scope of statistics is broad and extensive, and that our country is still in its infancy. In order to gather ideas and benefit from each other, he has specially sent Zhang Wuyuan, Director of the Statistical Office, Xu Renqian, a staff member of the Statistical Section, Wang Zhichang, and others, to various ministries and commissions in the central government and various agencies in Beijing and Shanghai to conduct on-site investigations and learn from each other, in order to make the statistical work in Henan Province more perfect.

<h3>US and East Africa Successively Reject Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the trend of the United States and South America rejecting Japanese goods has become increasingly apparent. This news has caused great anxiety among Japanese business circles, as opening up new markets is crucial to the future of Japan's export trade. According to the Japanese Minister to Mexico, the President of Guatemala told an American correspondent traveling in Central America that a few years ago, few Japanese goods were imported into Guatemala, but now they account for the fourth largest share of Guatemala's total imports. Therefore, the government has no choice but to prohibit their continued import. El Salvador recently issued new tariffs, making it impossible for Japanese goods to be imported at all. Nicaragua has recently implemented a policy of prohibiting Japanese goods, and due to internal politics, imports of Japanese goods have begun to decline. The Commercial Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Washington is currently traveling in Central American countries and has also reported to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States is experiencing a significant reduction in exports of coffee and bananas, so business is sluggish. They are now trying to prevent the import of Japanese goods in order to conclude a barter agreement with Japan, and are also negotiating a mutual commercial treaty with the United States. According to a report from the Japanese Consul in Mombasa, East Africa, the government of Tanganyika increased the import tax rate on Japanese goods from October 24, and the neighboring governments of Kenya and Uganda will also follow suit. In the first eight months of this year, the total value of Japanese goods imported into these three East African countries reached 13,165,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Jiahe Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Wounded Maritime Police Officer Dies in Xiamen</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Jiahe was hijacked by pirates in Shantou and three crew members were taken away. Besides the business manager Shen Qixiang and the charity worker Li Shaobing, the remaining one was the tally clerk Gao Liangchen. One member of the escort team, Yang Zetian, was shot and killed by the pirates, and another, Wu Jinyin, was wounded. Wu died of his injuries in a Xiamen hospital. Coffins were prepared separately for them in Xiamen. When the Jiahe departed from Shantou, it carried only 1,594 pieces of cargo, with fruit accounting for 868 pieces and ordinary cargo only 720 pieces. The Shanghai office received a telegram from the Shantou branch last night saying, "The Jiahe departed from Shantou this morning. Before departure, a sign was hung on the front cabin stating that, under the orders of the Maritime Administration Bureau, no passengers were to be taken. Now we have received a telegram from Xiamen that the ship was robbed, which is very shocking." If what the Shantou telegram said is true, and the Jiahe did not take passengers when it departed from Shantou, then how did the pirates get on board? This raises a question. Now that the ship has departed from Xiamen to return to Shanghai, it was originally planned to also sail to Wenzhou, but it will no longer go around Ou. It is expected to enter the port today.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Promulgates Regulations for Inspecting Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>Inspection Locations Limited to Stores</p>
<p>No Interception on the Road or Intrusion into Residences</p>
<p>The Xinhuashe reports that the stamp tax is one of the important compensations for abolishing miscellaneous taxes and reducing surcharges. After the Executive Yuan discussed and decided on the method of allocating subsidies, the Ministry of Finance actively planned for it. However, according to past results of this tax collection, there are many aspects that need to be improved, and in remote and poor areas, there is an unavoidable suspicion of causing harassment. Therefore, when implementing subsidies to local areas, the method of selling stamps was reorganized and changed to postal sales to prevent the evils of contracting and sales quotas. Regulations for inspection methods were also formulated to prevent problems such as missed or insufficient stamping. Regarding the implementation of the review of stamp tax matters, except for the Shanghai Concession, which is still handled according to previous regulations, the remaining areas are all the responsibility of the provincial, municipal, and county governments. However, the procedures to be followed when carrying out stamp tax inspections and how to distribute the fines should be properly regulated to prevent abuses. The Ministry of Finance has now announced thirteen regulations for inspecting stamp tax, which are implemented uniformly in all provinces and cities. The text of the regulations is appended below: Article 1: All inspections of stamps in provinces, cities, and counties, except for the Shanghai Special District, which has separate regulations, shall be handled in accordance with these regulations. Article 2: Each city and county shall be responsible for inspecting stamps, and the provincial stamp and tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus shall send personnel to conduct spot checks, and the Ministry of Finance shall send personnel to supervise from time to time. Article 3: Each city and county shall strictly implement stamp inspections at any time and place, and shall not announce them in advance or grant exemptions out of favor. Article 4: Inspection personnel shall be selected from those who are honest and familiar with tax laws. Article 5: Anyone may report violations of the stamp tax regulations. When inspection agencies or inspection personnel receive the aforementioned report, they shall immediately go to inspect. Article 6: Inspection personnel must carry an inspection certificate issued by the original dispatching agency or an order from the relevant official for identification when performing inspections.

<h3>Haining Drought Relief Association Cables Zhejiang Province to Request Suspension of Debt Collection</h3>
<p>The Haining Drought Relief Association sent a special telegram requesting a stop to the urgent collection of old land taxes by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. It also asked fellow villagers to work hard to raise donations to help the starving refugees. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Provincial Government Requesting Suspension of Debt Collection</p>
<p>The association telegraphed Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting a suspension of the collection of old debts to alleviate the people's suffering. The telegram read: "Chairman Lu and Director Wang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The drought situation in Haining this year is the most serious in the province and has long been understood. We are currently raising funds and joining forces with various charitable organizations in Shanghai to provide relief to the dying refugees. However, we have heard that the county government is urgently collecting old land taxes. Land tax is originally derived from land, and this year there is no harvest. Families with property and farmers are equally suffering, and the people are waiting for relief to survive. It does not seem reasonable to demand that they pay off old debts. The result will only cause disturbances. Therefore, we earnestly request that you quickly order the county to stop collecting taxes to benefit the refugees and alleviate the people's suffering. We are extremely anxious. Chairman Jiang Houyue and Xu Guangpu of the Haining County Drought Relief Association, respectfully."</p>
<p>Widespread Disaster, Insufficient Funds, Striving to Raise Relief</p>
<p>The drought in Haining this year is the most severe among the counties in Jiangnan. The seriousness of the disaster has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Recently, the Shanghai office of the Haining County Drought Relief Association has repeatedly requested the China and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, the Red Swastika Society, the China Jisheng Society, and the Bodhi Dharma Society to send Li Yunmen, Zheng Shouchun, Zhao Yulin, and Chen Meiqing as directors to lead relief workers to identify areas and provide emergency relief. The various districts are currently being investigated. However, the office of the association in Shanghai and charitable organizations such as the China and Foreign Famine Relief Committee have repeatedly received reports from the directors of various relief efforts stating that the disaster is widespread and funds are insufficient. They are urgently requesting increased relief funds to be remitted to Haining as soon as possible. The situation is extremely urgent. The China and Foreign Famine Relief Committee and the Jisheng Society have decided to increase the remittance to save people's lives. However, the funds for this emergency relief from the association, apart from the 30,000 yuan remaining from the Renchen relief, are mainly temporary loans from the banking sector by Chairman Xu Shenru. There are really no funds to increase. The winter and spring relief efforts are approaching in an instant, making it even more difficult to continue. It is said that the association has now formulated forms and sent letters to fellow villagers in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Pinghan, Suzhou, and Hangzhou to report on the amount of funds already raised and to continue to work hard to raise funds to save their hometown and benefit the refugees.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works Erects Signs for the Third Requisitioned Land Area</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works announced that the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau has started registration for the third requisitioned land area in the city center on October 11th. Many residents have been going to the area for inspection. The bureau has recently erected directional signs at key intersections in the city center to indicate the route to the third requisitioned land area. In addition, a large sign with a land boundary map has been erected at the edge of the requisitioned area, so that residents can clearly understand the location and shape of the land they intend to requisition.</p>
<h3>Accountants Association Submits Petition to Mandate Registration of Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Strict Supervision to be Implemented</p>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association, in light of the recent frequent bankruptcies of financial institutions such as banks, which have had a significant impact on society, and the fact that some have not registered according to the law, making it impossible to investigate beforehand and providing no guarantee afterward, implicating depositors and shaking merchants, causing unimaginable harm, has specially submitted a petition to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, as well as the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting that registration be mandated according to the law and that strict supervision be implemented at all times to prevent problems. The original petition is recorded below. The petition states that recently, bankruptcies of financial institutions such as banks have been frequently heard, having a deep and significant impact on society. Therefore, it is requested that strict supervision be implemented to prevent problems. The association has passed a resolution at a members' meeting that businesses such as banks, trust companies, silver companies, savings associations, and life insurance are of utmost importance to society. In recent years, bankruptcies of banks and trust companies have occurred one after another, implicating depositors and shaking merchants. The reasons for their failure are either unsound organization or illegal operation, and some have not even registered according to the law, indicating a perfunctory attitude from the beginning and an inevitable neglect of operations. If this continues, the harm will be incalculable. The members of the association are responsible for commercial matters and should uphold the government's intention to bring commercial affairs into order and seek remedies for deficiencies. Therefore, it is proposed to petition the Ministries of Finance and Industry and the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs to strictly investigate the organization of financial businesses in various places. Those who have not registered shall be ordered to register, otherwise they shall be strictly punished. Even those who have already registered should be subject to strict supervision at all times to maintain standards and prevent problems before they occur. If accountants are needed to assist, they should perform their duties to fulfill the mission of serving society. The newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government, ordering unregistered banks to register according to regulations, and ordering the Bankers Association to refuse membership to unregistered banks. This shows the government's clear understanding and attention to detail. We are greatly impressed and admired. However, the business operations of trust companies, silver companies, savings associations, life insurance, and other industries, although slightly different from those of banks, are essentially the same in terms of attracting deposits. Once an unfortunate event occurs, it is enough to disrupt the financial market and endanger commerce. Therefore, they should all be ordered to register in order to prevent problems before they occur. Furthermore, attention should also be paid to the method of supervision at all times. It cannot be said that once registered, crises can be avoided. Therefore, it is essential to strictly define the responsibility of those who submit annual reports and find effective ways to conduct random inspections. By leveraging the authority of government orders, their norms can be corrected, the financial resources of merchants and the public will not be implicated, and the reputation of the financial sector will be enhanced. Our humble opinion may or may not be appropriate. We hereby submit this petition to your department for adoption and implementation to stabilize the commercial market and benefit the public.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners Petition Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Still Consider the Response Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Rickshaw owners in the special zone previously petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council due to their opposition to the Rickshaw Committee's compulsory registration of rickshaw pullers, forcing them to change to new rickshaws, arbitrarily impounding vehicles, and imposing arbitrary penalties. Because the response was not satisfactory, over 500 rickshaw owners petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council again at 9:30 a.m. yesterday. After arriving at the council, they selected Jin Chunlin, Wang Kunyi, Qiu Jizang, Hou Shaoan, Yin Zhifang, Hua Zhongsu, Bao Zhenhuang, Zhao Rongfu, Lu Yuzhai, Wang Runtao, and ten others as representatives to meet with Council Officer He DeKui. They stated that the rickshaw owners were dissatisfied with the response and reiterated their original demands, determined to achieve their goals. It wasn't until 12:30 p.m. that Council Officer He ordered all rickshaw owners to return first and listen to the response at 3:00 p.m. In the afternoon, the ten representatives went again, but there was still no satisfactory result. It is said that they will petition Director-General Zhong Si this morning and plan to convene a general meeting of all rickshaw owners within the next few days to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Pudong Electric Company Receives Another Honorary Certificate</h3>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company, which has been operating for fifteen years, has seen its business develop day by day. All its economic operations and engineering projects have been commended by the Construction Committee. In 1931, when the committee began issuing honorary certificates, the company received the first certificate. In 1932 and 1933, it received the ninth and thirteenth certificates respectively. This October, it received the twenty-first certificate. The committee has issued over twenty such certificates in the past four years, and the company has received one certificate each year, totaling four, making it the most decorated. Its excellent performance can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>Female Journalist Wang Xiaomeng Returns Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>Eloquently Discusses the Radical Nature of the American Women's Movement</p>
<p>According to the Kuo Wen News Agency, Miss Wang Xiaomeng, after graduating from Shanghai University in 1931, worked as the Women's Column Editor for the English-language "China Press". Last summer, she went to the United States at her own expense, hoping to further her studies. She was then admitted to the University of Southern California, and this summer, she obtained a Master's degree in journalism. After leaving the United States, she traveled around Europe, her footprints covering the globe, incidentally investigating the progress of women's movements in various countries. At the beginning of October, she took an Italian mail ship back to China, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning. Dong Xianguang, the general manager of "China Press," along with friends, went to the ship to greet her. The reporter from the Kuo Wen News Agency met Miss Wang yesterday at her residence on Avenue Joffre. She graciously received them and discussed the radical nature of the American women's movement. She briefly mentioned that in the United States, both men and women receive a considerable education from an early age, and when they grow up, they think of becoming independent to break away from their parents. They boldly seek results, not only obtaining various careers and political power but also gaining extreme trust in society. Every woman, in addition to possessing life skills, has an efficiency in doing things that surpasses that of men. They can be completely economically independent, but most women do not like to marry, nor do they like to have children or manage household affairs. Even if they have children, the feelings between women are very distant. However, they are naturally fond of cleanliness, and very few use servants. Their residences are all spotless. Regarding husbands, the economic boundaries between the two parties are extremely strict. After marriage, each spends what they have for their own use, and there is no mixing. If they marry in the morning and disagree in the evening, they will divorce immediately. On the women's side, they feel that they can socialize freely after divorce, so most women enter social service, and men often take care of housework. Women are extremely strict with themselves because they must first be upright themselves, and their words and deeds must be meticulous to gain the trust and respect of society. Therefore, the status of women is also very solid. Germany is completely the opposite. Hitler and Mussolini, almost in words and deeds, both believe that the love of a mother and child is greater than any force and is also easy to approach, and they claim that to enrich the country, one must first strengthen the people, and to strengthen the people, one must first have good national physiques. They unanimously advocate that women should not participate in politics or enter society but should focus on managing household affairs so that children can receive a good education, which is the opposite of the American advocacy. However, each has its advantages and disadvantages. Things for people all have the needs of an era, with no absolute good and no absolute bad, etc. As for Miss Wang's return to China, she is extremely exhausted from the journey and plans to take a short rest. Whether she will return to work at "China Press" or teach is currently undecided.</p>
<h3>Fellow Townsmen in San Francisco Telegraph Provincial Authorities to Thoroughly Investigate County Magistrate Tu</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xuan You and other fellow townsmen from Jinshan residing in Shanghai telegraphed the provincial authorities, saying, "To Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs, and all directors and members: County Magistrate Tu of Jinshan has implemented misguided measures and is not in harmony with public opinion. Citizens of the county have long accused him in writing. Recently, he has been even more involved in corruption and dereliction of duty, abusing the law and wielding power arbitrarily. Taking the defense funds as an example, the distribution is improper, and the accounting is unclear. The county party headquarters has reported his bad deeds, and the heads of various districts have submitted their resignations afterward. The upper and lower levels are disintegrating, and everything has come to a standstill. News is frequently transmitted, and we are worried as if our hearts are being pounded. We dare to risk disrespectfully submitting this petition, earnestly requesting a prompt and thorough investigation and punishment to comply with public sentiment and maintain county administration. In our telegram, we cannot express the urgency of awaiting orders. Sincerely, Xuan You, Fan Shuhan, Chen Guanghui, Jiang Ang, Yu Zhicheng, Yang Daohong, Fang Chongzhi, Huang Shizheng, Zhuang Chun, Hu Youshan, and more than twenty other fellow townsmen from Jinshan residing in Shanghai, bowing."

<h3>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association Sends Letters to All Sectors Promoting Domestically Produced Automobile Lubricating Oil</h3>
<p>The China Manufacturing Oil Factory in Shanghai, in view of the fact that a large number of automobile lubricating oil ("machine oil") is imported every year, and now that highway transportation in various provinces is developed, long-distance buses are flourishing, and in Shanghai, private cars, taxis, and moving and freight cars are also increasing day by day, this drain on China's economy is quite significant. After careful research, they have created a "Castor Leaf" brand of automobile lubricating oil to replace imported goods and save economic rights. It is said that the gentlemen of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association are doing their best to promote this automobile oil and yesterday sent letters to all sectors, asking them to try it out. Here is a transcription of their original letter: "Dear Sirs, according to our fellow townsman Xiao Xiangang, the amount of imported oil is a serious drain on our country's resources. Now, the China Manufacturing Oil Factory has produced a "Castor Leaf" brand of automobile lubricating oil, which is refined from domestic castor seeds, rapeseed, and other vegetable oils. The oil is thin and has a natural strong adhesion, which makes it difficult for the machinery to heat up and accumulate dirt. It can protect the parts, and it can save the trouble of changing the thickness in winter and summer. The oil consumption is low and the efficiency is high, which is completely different from imported mineral oil. It is the only good product in China. Now it is managed by Yongda Machine Oil Company. Although our country has not yet mined gasoline, we should ask your association to tell our fellow townsmen and elders to enthusiastically purchase and use automobile lubricating oil since there are domestic inventions. Promote it to prevent financial losses," etc. It has been found that the current automobile oil is imported. Because of the need for transportation, it has contributed to the economic invasion of foreigners, which is very painful. Now that there is domestic lubricating oil available for substitution, we should work together to promote it so as to avoid the outflow of money. According to the previous situation in the letter, we hereby urgently write to you to vigorously promote it and put it into practice. The future of domestic products is truly dependent on you." This is truly good news for the domestic goods industry.</p>
<h3>Women's Art Performance for Winter Relief in Drought Areas</h3>
<p>Initiated by the wives of Li Zuyu and others</p>
<p>This year's drought in various places is extremely severe, as has never been seen before. At this time of cold season, the disaster situation is even more tragic. The victims in the drought areas are extremely desperate. Things like buying wives and selling children, and committing suicide by taking poison are endless. Ladies from all walks of life in Shanghai could not bear to sit idly by and thought of ways to help. Thus, the wives of Li Zuyu, Zhu Luli, Wu Tiecheng, Gu Weijun, Liu Dajun, Chu Minyi and others gathered like-minded people and organized a Women's Art Performance for Winter Relief in Drought Areas. At that time, the most upscale theater in Shanghai was rented, and famous musicians from all over the country, such as Master Hongdouguan, Mr. Xu Moyan, Master Jinggu, Master Lengxiangzhai, Dr. Mei Lanfang, etc., were invited to perform Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera for two days. The proceeds from the tickets will be used for disaster relief. It is expected that there will be a constant stream of people and horses at that time, which will be very grand for a time.</p>

<h3>Two Detectives Pretend to Be Detectives and Extort Money from Second-Hand Goods Dealers</h3>
<p>Writing Loan Notes with Savage Intent</p>
<p>Second-Hand Goods Dealers are Frightened and Move</p>
<p>Guo Tingfu, a Yangzhou native residing at No. 101 Mill Street in the French Concession, is 50 years old this year. He has been engaged in the business of selling second-hand goods or receiving stolen goods for resale. This was learned by Hua Bu Wu Guijin (32 years old, Qingjiang native) of No. 282 of the McLean Police Station (i.e., the Big Ben) and Hua Bu Tang Jingen (35 years old, Jiangbei native) of No. 63. The two patrolmen colluded with each other. On the afternoon of the 28th of last month at about 4:00 PM, Wu and Tang took advantage of their off-duty time, wore plain clothes, and went to Guo's residence together, pretending to be detectives, claiming to be searching. At that time, Guo happened to be out. The two patrolmen Wu and Tang went to Guo's bedroom on the third floor and searched. Then, under the bed, they found four bars of soap and strongly pointed out that Guo had received stolen goods. They ordered Guo's roommate Wan Youming to ask Guo's son to call Guo Tingfu home. After Guo Tingfu returned home, the two patrolmen Wu and Tang insisted on taking Guo to the police station for investigation, otherwise, he would have to pay 100 yuan to settle the matter. At that time, Guo told them that this soap was entrusted to him by a friend to bring back to Jiangbei, but Wu and others ignored it. Later, Guo, in order to avoid trouble, paid 5 yuan, and entrusted Wan Youming to pay Wu and Tang, but the two patrolmen refused and still wanted to take him to the police station. Guo was anxious and asked Wan to temporarily guarantee that he would find a way to raise money. The two patrolmen then agreed that Wan and Guo would meet at the Da Zhong Restaurant at the corner of Zhengjia Bridge and Edward Road that evening to negotiate a solution. At 1 AM, when Wan and Guo arrived at the Da Zhong Restaurant, only Wu Guijin was there. The three began to negotiate, with Wan speaking on the spot, ordering Guo to pay 60 yuan to settle the matter. However, Guo could not raise this huge amount of money at once. Wu then ordered Guo to issue two loan notes of 30 yuan each, dated August 29 and September 29, stating that they would be repaid in two installments on the 2nd and 9th of this month. Wu also ordered Chen Jinquan, a Yangzhou native and waiter in the hotel, to write the loan notes. Later, Guo and Wan were able to escape, but Guo ultimately made a living as a small vendor. How could he raise this money? He was afraid of the power of the two patrolmen Wu and Tang, so the whole family moved to No. 7 Feijia Lane, Kangdi Road, to hide. When the deadline came, the two patrolmen Wu and Tang went to get the money, but Guo had already moved. They then ordered Wan Youming to hand over Guo Tingfu. At this point, Guo could not bear the harassment, so he and Wan Youming reported to the French police station. After receiving the report, the police chief summoned the two patrolmen to the case and found a similar loan note on each of them. He reported the matter to the chief patrolman, who dismissed and detained the two patrolmen. He also sent detective Wang Rusong and detective Wang Dongwan to find out the whole story of the case. Yesterday afternoon, the two patrolmen were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, where Judge Li Changnian conducted the interrogation. The police station lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, accusing them of the crimes of intimidation and dereliction of duty under Articles 370 and 129 of the Criminal Code. Then, the plaintiff Guo Tingfu and the witnesses Wan Youming and Chen Jinquan stated the process of the defendants' extortion and forced loan notes. Detective Wang Dongwan reported the investigation and presented the two loan notes to the court. When Tang Jingen was interrogated, he confessed that he knew Wan Youming. Wan first borrowed 20 yuan from me, and then said that Guo Tingfu also wanted to borrow 20 yuan. Because I had no money, I borrowed it from Wu Guijin. Because Wu has always lent money, Wan invited Guo to voluntarily issue a loan note of 30 yuan including interest. There was no search for soap or extortion. I was falsely accused, and I asked for investigation. When Wu Guijin was questioned, his confession was the same as Tang's, and he hired lawyer Wang Shizong to defend him. The court verified the confession, announced the end of the debate, and scheduled the sentence for the 10th. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Sun Temple Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Former Resident Receives Criminal Punishment</p>
<p>New Resident Cannot Take Over</p>
<p>The Sun Temple on Datong Road in Zhabei was founded in the fifth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, built by the female lay Buddhist Jiang Dexian, who raised funds from local people. It is purely local public property and has always been managed by monks selected by donors and local gentry. Recently, the abbot of the temple, Yuejin, suddenly received criminal punishment due to a flower fair, so he was stripped of his abbot qualification and the Sun Temple was returned to the donors. The donors, including He Liandi, then elected the monk Ruhai as the abbot of the temple. He was scheduled to take over on July 25 of this year, but unexpectedly, the monk Ziyan, who claimed to be the abbot, refused to hand over the temple. The former abbot, the old monk Lingyan, then filed a criminal self-accusation with the local court against Ziyan for attempting to seize the temple, requesting a thorough investigation and attaching a private accusation. As a result, Ziyan was sentenced to 30 days of detention, and the property of the Sun Temple was handed over to the plaintiff for management. Ziyan refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal in the second instance, claiming that it was a civil legal relationship and did not give rise to criminal issues. Now, the monk Ruhai hired lawyer Peng Xuehai to file a lawsuit with the local court to confirm his identity, requesting that the defendant monk Ziyan be ordered to hand over the Sun Temple for management to protect public property. The object of the lawsuit is to confirm the plaintiff as the abbot of the Sun Temple, stating that the defendant Ziyan is the disciple of the monk Xianbang. Xianbang died in 1926, and Xiande became the abbot, squandering almost all of the temple's property. Fearing that the gentry donors would question him, he fled to Taizhou in 1929. At that time, the defendant left the Sun Temple and went out. Other monks could not maintain it, so they obtained the consent of the gentry donors and hired the monk Lingyan of Yuantong Temple to serve concurrently as the abbot of the Sun Temple. After Lingyan took over, he paid off the debts and repaired the temple, achieving good results. Later, because of old age, he could not take care of it, so he sent the monk Yuejin as the abbot. Later, because Yuejin was reported for flower fair relations, he was punished. Therefore, the temple was returned to the donor He Liandi, who was then elected by the local gentry as the abbot of the temple, and a temple board of directors was formally established to manage the temple property and reported to the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau for registration on file. The Sun Temple was built by the female lay Buddhist Jiang Dexian who raised funds, and it has always been managed by the donor He Liandi. This is an undisputed fact by both parties. Therefore, the Sun Temple is local public property, and no one can claim private ownership, which is undoubtedly beyond doubt, etc. After receiving the submission, the court held a special hearing in the Fourth Tribunal yesterday morning by Judge Chen Wenkai. The plaintiff, monk Ruhai, did not arrive, and his agent, lawyer Peng Xuehai, arrived, stating Ruhai's age as 42, from Hubei, and the grounds for the lawsuit, requesting confirmation that the plaintiff was the abbot of the Sun Temple. Then, the witnesses He Liandi and the monk Lingyan testified everything. The judge obtained the confession and adjourned the hearing to a later date because the defendant did not arrive.</p>
<h3>Zhu Ziyun is Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Two Medical Organizations Provide Written Proof</p>
<p>Pulse and Medicine Match, Medicine Dosage is Not Excessive</p>
<p>Zhu Ziyun, a traditional Chinese medicine pediatrician and ENT specialist from Jiangwan, was recently sued by Cai Ziying, a Yangzhou native, who hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, accusing him of causing death due to negligence. Judge Wu Zehan of the First Special Court has summoned him twice, and the details have been published in this newspaper. At 11:30 yesterday morning, Judge Wu summoned him again in the Third Criminal Court. Zhu Ziyun hired lawyer Lu Qi to defend him. The court then handed the prescription submitted by the plaintiff to Zhu for review, asking whether it was his prescription. Zhu replied yes. The court also asked whether the plaintiff's child, Shunbao, had given him Ma Yuanyuan's previous prescription to review when he came to see the doctor. He replied, no, and claimed that according to the usual practice of doctors, if the first prescription is not correct, the direction must be changed. Now, the three prescriptions I prescribed are all the same, which shows that there was no change after taking the medicine, etc. The court then summoned the witness Zhou Shaoyu to the case. According to his confession, on July 26 of this year, he was invited by Dr. Dong to diagnose and treat the plaintiff's child. At that time, the child was already in great danger and it was impossible to save him. According to the plaintiff, after taking Dr. Zhu's medicine, the child's condition changed greatly. The court then handed the three prescriptions prescribed by Zhu Ziyun to Zhou for review, asking whether the pulse case and the prescription were consistent. He replied that the pulse case and the medicine were completely consistent and there was no discrepancy. However, when I went to see the doctor, the child's condition was completely hot, etc. Then, Ma Mingyuan reported to the case and testified that the plaintiff's child, because he had measles, was diagnosed and treated by me on June 8. The last time I diagnosed and treated him was on July 15. The child's measles had healed and still needed conditioning. Unexpectedly, he started eating meat too early, which caused him to become ill again. The court then handed Song's three prescriptions to him for review, asking whether the pulse case and the medicine were consistent and whether the medicine dosage was too heavy. He replied that it was consistent and the medicine dosage should be determined according to the severity of the disease, etc. Judge Wu then announced that the court had sent a letter to the Shenzhou Medical Association and the China National Medicine Association for identification. The two associations convened various medical groups in the city on the 4th of this month for discussion and replied to the court, stating that the pulse and medicine of Zhu Ziyun's prescription were consistent and the medicine dosage was not excessive. The reply letter was also issued to both parties for review. The court then ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's lawyer expressed dissatisfaction with the identification and requested that the Central National Medicine Museum be re-identified. Judge Wu believed that there was no need for re-identification and ruled to reject the application. The plaintiff's lawyer declared an appeal. Judge Wu ruled that the ruling could not be appealed according to law. Then, after the lawyers from both sides began to debate, the court ruled that the debate was over and the verdict was set to be announced. Zhu Ziyun is not guilty.</p>
<h3>Horrifying News: Attempted Murder of a Brother for Property</h3>
<p>The Chauffeur of Huang Jinrong Narrowly Escapes an Ambush</p>
<p>Xu Xiaodu Actually Enters into a Contract to Kill His Brother</p>
<p>Xu Guilin, a local resident, currently 40 years old, works as a chauffeur for Huang Jinrong, the owner of the Great World theater. He lives at No. 11, Lane 54, Gordon Road. His parents are deceased, but they left behind three siblings, including Guilin, and eighteen old and new houses on Gordon Road, valued at tens of thousands of dollars. After the death of their parents, the houses were divided into three equal shares, with Guilin, his younger brother Xiaodu (also known as Jiantang), and the youngest brother, Guisheng, each receiving six houses. Unfortunately, Guisheng passed away due to illness on the eighth day of the first month of the lunar calendar this year, and all of his property had been sold to Guilin before his death. Xu Xiaodu, on the other hand, did not engage in any productive work, and gradually sold off all of his houses. Recently, Xiaodu repeatedly asked his brother Guilin for loans, but was refused. As a result, a malicious thought arose in his mind. He colluded with Wang Gensheng and others from Nanxiang to kill Guilin, hoping to inherit his property. However, because</p>
<p>The plan was not kept secret, someone reported it to Detective Ma Jinbiao of the Putuo Road Police Station. On the evening before last, at around 9 p.m., he, along with Detective Chief Shi Enjian, Detective Xu Huanqing, and Bailiff Zhao Zifang, apprehended Xu Xiaodu and Wang Gensheng. They also seized a wood-chopping knife and a written contract, and brought them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, in addition to prosecuting the two defendants, Xu and Wang, for attempted murder under Article 383, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law, he also detailed the circumstances of the case. He stated that the defendant Xu Xiaodu and the victim Xu Guilin were brothers who each inherited a certain amount of ancestral property. Guilin, through diligence and thrift, increased his wealth, while Xiaodu did not engage in any productive work and sold off all of his family property, leading him to repeatedly ask Guilin for loans. On several occasions, he was refused, and he harbored resentment in his heart. In August of this year, he discussed with Wang Gensheng the idea of</p>
<p>Finding a way to kill his brother, so that he could inherit his brother's property worth 70,000 yuan. If the plan succeeded, he would pay a reward of 2,000 yuan. Wang, unwilling to do it himself, agreed to find a reliable person. Later, Wang discussed it with his friend Chen Qiuquan, as Chen and Wang both worked as laborers in the Shenxin No. 9 Factory. Chen agreed to a reward of 1,000 yuan if the plan succeeded. At the time, Chen did not commit himself, only saying that he would consider it further. Therefore, Chen, on the 30th of last month, discussed it at length with his sworn brother, Sha Mapi. They both believed that this matter involved human life, and the responsibility was great, and advised Chen not to do it. They also feared that if Chen refused, Wang Gensheng would inevitably find someone else to carry out the plan. Therefore, they immediately reported it to Chinese Detective Ma Jinbiao, who reported it to the police station. At that time, the police station, believing that it was only necessary to warn the two defendants, did not arrest them. Instead, they devised a plan, instructing Sha Mapi to contact Wang and</p>
<p>Pretend to agree to his request. Wang was satisfied upon hearing this. On the evening before last, at 9 p.m., Xu Xiaodu, Wang Gensheng, and Sha Mapi went together to Room 26 of the Zhongxing Hotel at No. 64, Lane 234, Ma Bai Road. Xu used the alias Wang Jiantang and discussed the method of carrying out the plan. Sha asked Xu how much the reward would be. Xu replied 2,000 yuan. At that time, they drew up a written contract, and Xu and Wang both signed and affixed their fingerprints to it. The contract stated that if Xu Guilin was killed, a reward of 2,000 yuan would be paid, otherwise the contract would be void. After the contract was completed, Wang went outside to Zhou Shaogen's tailor shop at No. 1075, Macau Road, and falsely claimed that he was chopping firewood, so he managed to get a knife and took it back to give to Sha Mapi.</p>
<p>Instructing him to carry out the plan. At that time, the detectives outside the door followed and entered, arresting them. The contract was verified to be in Xu's handwriting, and the contract and knife were presented as evidence. Subsequently, the witness Sha Mapi and the victim Xu Guilin submitted reports proving everything. When questioned, Xu Xiaodu initially gave evasive answers, but later admitted without hesitation that he intended to harm his brother. Because Guilin had swallowed his younger brother Guisheng's houses, he wanted to kill him. Wang Gensheng also confessed that he was entrusted by Xu to find Chen Qiuquan. The court then appointed lawyer Fan Gang to cross-examine the police station's lawyer. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confession and sentenced Xu Xiaodu to three years of imprisonment for preparing to kill a collateral relative, and Wang Gensheng to two years of imprisonment for assisting in preparing to kill a collateral relative. The contract was confiscated.</p>
<h3>A Small and Winding Printing Shop</h3>
<p>Cannot be Reached Without Passing Through Many Houses</p>
<p>Surprisingly, a Small Operation Employs a Printer as a Watchman</p>
<p>—A Forged Match Coupon Leads to a Breakthrough—</p>
<p>Recently, the Ruilun Tobacco Company on Kaifeng Road, in order to promote its business, has been attaching gift coupons to its company brand cigarettes. The lowest value coupon is a match coupon. Any customer who obtains such a coupon can go to a nearby tobacco shop and exchange it for a box of matches. To protect the business of the tobacco shops, if a tobacco shop accumulates 1,000 match coupons, it can exchange them for seven yuan in cash from the company. However, Ruilun Company recently discovered that someone was privately manufacturing company brand match gift coupons, so it paid special attention. Until the 30th of last month, Zhang Zhilin, Shi Pengcheng, Tong Quanyuan, Chen Shunrong, and others went to redeem cash with forged coupons and were reported to the Concession Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest them and they were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. This was reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Gu Jieqing from Pudong also brought 30 forged coupons to a tobacco shop at No. 29, Baoyu Lane, French Concession, to exchange for matches. He was discovered and reported to the French police, who arrested Gu. Since there was already a case in the Public Concession, the Concession Police Station was notified and dispatched Detective Chief Shang Wu and Detective Ji Xiuquan to bring Gu back. They investigated the source of the forged coupons. Gu confessed that they were given to him by his brother, Gu Jiezhen. The detectives went to No. 57, Hengmao Lane, Mintini Road, to arrest Gu Jiezhen. Gu then led them to No. 12, Wenyuan Fang, on the same road, where they seized a large number of forged coupons, totaling 300,000. Gu Jiezhen confessed that the coupons were printed at the Damei Printing Shop run by Xu Heyun at No. 35, Lane 113, Lafayette Road. The Chinese and Western detectives went to arrest Xu, but did not find any forged coupons. They then went to No. 47, Lane 551, Xinzha Road, and found three lead plates. The lead plates were sent by Xu, intending to destroy the evidence. The lead plates were full of the image of the forged coupon, fearing that the matter would be exposed, so they were sent to be destroyed. The back of the lead plates had the words "Damei" on them, and they were all brought back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, along with the four previously arrested, Zhang Zhilin, etc., they were all sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the above circumstances and declared that the structure of Xu Heyun's printing shop was very strange. The main door was usually closed, and people entered and exited through a side door. A printer was hired as a watchman. In order to reach the printing area of the printing shop, one had to pass through many winding houses. There was only a very small machine and a paper cutter. The scale was not large, so why hire a printer as a watchman? The appearance was very suspicious. It was actually an organization specializing in manufacturing various forged coupons. Because the police station still needed to investigate the case, it requested a postponement. The Ruilun Tobacco Company engaged lawyer Tang Mingshi to represent the defendant Xu Heyun, while lawyer Fan Gang was engaged to defend him. After a brief interrogation by the court, it was ordered to postpone the interrogation to another date. The defendants were returned to detention.</p>
<h3>The Accountant of the Fresh Pork Industry Association Falsely Reports a Theft and Embezzles Funds</h3>
<p>Yang Weixin is Extremely Foolish</p>
<p>Detectives Ascertain the Truth</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 2 p.m., Yang Weisheng, the accountant of the Fresh Pork Industry Association in Sunjia Lane, inside the Dadongmen (age 25, from Shaoxing), suddenly went to the 16th Concession Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to report that at around 10 a.m. today (yesterday), he was carrying 2,692.18 yuan in public funds. He left the association and walked to the Yuanda Pig Shop in Yong'an Lane, 16th Concession. He first paid 208.96 yuan to the shop and obtained a receipt, then carried the remaining funds and went out. As he was about to deposit the money in the Tonghe Bank on Limalu Road, he unexpectedly encountered two men he did not recognize at the entrance of Tiemao Lane on Xianhua Street. They greeted him and led him into the lane. The two men suddenly took out pistols from their sides and threatened him, forbidding him to make a sound. At the same time, they took all the 2,485.22 yuan in paper money from his pocket and fled with the stolen goods. At that time, he knew he had been robbed and was stunned. After a while, he regained his composure and immediately reported to the chairman of the association, Xin Zhouxiang, and then came to the bureau to report. He requested that the robbers be pursued. The bureau, because Yang's report had many suspicious points, and it was unlikely that there would be such a foolish person who would carry a large sum of money and follow strangers into a small alley when greeted on the street, immediately dispatched team leader Dong Mingde and Han Ruisheng, along with detectives Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, and Yuan Mingcai, to investigate. They learned that Yang Weisheng was fond of pleasure and often went to Tianyun Lou and other entertainment venues to seek pleasure, and because he was addicted to opium, his monthly salary was not enough. He had no choice but to privately use more than 600 yuan of public funds. In desperation, he came up with a strange idea. On the 5th of this month, after collecting 2,485.22 yuan in membership fees from various members, he secretly took 285.22 yuan from it to repay the money he had spent, and hid the remaining 2,200 yuan behind the bed curtains in the mezzanine of the wall, for future use. Then, yesterday, he first sent 206.96 yuan of other public funds to the Yuanda Pig Shop, and then lingered for a long time in the Xianhua Street area of Xiaodongmen, and then rushed to the Changyuan Pig Shop to falsely report the robbery to Xin Zhouxiang, the chairman of the association. They immediately rushed to the Fresh Pork Industry Association in Sunjia Lane and found 2,200 yuan of stolen money in the wall behind Yang's bed. He then reported the information to the branch director Guan Gong, and then brought Yang Weisheng to trial. He confessed everything after questioning. Because it involved embezzlement of public funds and falsely reporting a robbery, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Careless Fire on the Third Floor of Jin Hua Foreign Firm Warehouse</h3>
<p>Wool Stored Inside Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 9 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor of the Jin Hua Foreign Firm warehouse at No. 60, Sichuan Road and Guangdong Road. By the time street patrolmen noticed it, the fire was already out of control, and flames were bursting out of the windows. Fortunately, the Central Fire Brigade received the alarm and rushed fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire. However, at that time, it was already a raging fire and it was impossible to enter. A ladder was raised and water was sprayed from the outside. After more than two hours, the fire was gradually extinguished. As a result, the second floor of the warehouse was completely burned, and the wool stored inside was completely destroyed. The loss was considerable. The cause of the fire is still unclear and is currently under investigation.</p>

<h3>Tragic Death of a Child Laborer</h3>
<p>Right Arm Severed by Machine Belt</p>
<p>Died Tragically After Ineffective Treatment at the Hospital</p>
<p>Ji Zhengyuan, a child from Haimen, currently 15 years old, lived at No. 15, Lane 70, Xiaoshadu Road. He worked as a laborer in the roving department of the Puyi Yarn Factory at No. 8, Robison Road. Yesterday evening at around 7 p.m., a belt on the machine fell down. The machine manager, Jiang Guisheng, was lazy and ordered Ji Zhengyuan to drag the belt onto the iron hook. The motor was humming. Ji's right arm was caught in the belt and severed instantly. He lost consciousness. He was sent to the Baolong Hospital for treatment, but died at 10 p.m. After the hospital reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, a detective was ordered to investigate and the body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>There are Two Morphine Dens in the French Concession</h3>
<p>One on Rue Luber and One on Rue Wantz</p>
<p>Extremely Large Scale, Not Comparable to Ordinary Ones</p>
<p>—Two People Detained by the Public Concession Pending Trial—</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Feng Zhiming, the Chinese detective chief of the Narcotics Department of the General Police Station, Detective Bao Liansheng, and Western Detective Hale, successively arrested Shan Tinggui from Changzhou and Cong Shengjiu from Fengtian, two private morphine traffickers, at No. 33, Qingchang Lane, Avenue Emile Zola. One tael of morphine, a small sample package, many lead rings, seals, envelopes, and other items were seized. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Public Works Department, because the main culprit He Xinbo was at large and the organization had not been investigated, did not prosecute Shan and Cong, but only requested permission to detain them. According to the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, the police station received a report yesterday that someone was selling morphine at No. 33, Lane 396 (Qingchang Lane), Avenue Emile Zola. He reported this to the court and obtained a search warrant. At 4 p.m., he first sent female detective Zhou Huici to contact Shan, wanting to buy ten taels of morphine. Shan said that the morphine was stored elsewhere. To buy ten taels, it would cost 230 yuan, and the goods would be delivered at 5:30 p.m. He gave her a sample package of morphine, which Zhou took away. At 5:30 p.m., he and the Chinese and Western detectives went and waited outside the door. Detective Zhou entered first. Shan said that because the money had not been paid, he would only give one tael first, and the other nine taels would be given after the money was paid. At that time, the detectives rushed in and arrested Shan. Soon after, Cong Shengjiu arrived and was also arrested. Cong confessed that he went to No. 17, Ba'an Fang, Rue de la Gare, French Concession. The detectives and French police detectives went to search Cong's house but found nothing. Cong then pointed out that the morphine was hidden in the small inn next door at No. 16. They went to search and found only many lead rings. These lead rings were used on leather shoes. However, the sample given to the female detective by Shan had this kind of lead ring nailed to the envelope, and the words "Remember the Chrysanthemum" were printed on it. When asked where the morphine came from, he said that he got it from He Xinbo, who lived at No. 53, Wanyi Fang, Rue Luber, and whose wholesale point was at No. 19, Yongji Lane, Rue Wantz. The police station went to investigate these two places, but the organizations set up there were extremely large and not comparable to ordinary ones. He requested permission to detain them for investigation. According to the detectives' report, when questioned, Shan Tinggui and others confessed to selling morphine and earning one yuan per tael. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the confession and ordered that Shan and Cong be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Oriental Trust Company Sues Fang Liujun, Etc. for Repayment of Debt</h3>
<p>Defendant Fails to Appear for Trial</p>
<p>The Court Orders a Rescheduled Hearing</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Oriental Trust Company at No. 462 Fujian Road went out of business on May 10 of this year and declared liquidation on May 21. Lawyer Zhang Shijie and accountant Qin Yanzhao were appointed as liquidators, with full power to handle all liquidation matters. It was found that Fang Liujun, the owner of the Dachang Military Uniform and Leather Goods Shop at No. 5, Lane 6, Deqing Lane, Moore Road, had borrowed 3,000 yuan in national currency from the company on April 10 of this year, agreeing to repay it on June 10 of this year. Fang Jiaobo was responsible for guaranteeing it, and a promissory note was made as evidence. However, it was not repaid when due. The handler Zou Rangqing (manager of the Oriental Trust Company) lent the money because he fully trusted Fang Jiaobo's guarantee, so he did not even verify the address of the Dachang Shop. Later, after repeated urging from lawyer Zhang Shijie, Fang Jiaobo was uncooperative. It was not until recently that Fang told the address of the Dachang Shop. The liquidators Zhang Shijie and others sent a special letter to Fang Liujun, the owner of the Dachang Shop, on October 13, ordering him to repay the debt within a time limit. However, after half a month, there was no response. Lawyer Zhang believes that the liquidation period of the Oriental Trust Company is about to expire, and all repayments need to be collected as soon as possible in order to close the case. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special District District Court and requested a declaration of provisional execution. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., Judge Peng Shi summoned the debtor Fang Liujun and guarantor Fang Jiaobo to the fourteenth court, but neither of them appeared in court. Lawyer Zhang Shijie stated the reasons for the lawsuit and presented the defendant's promissory note as evidence. The court ordered that since the defendants were not present today, the defendants would be summoned to court again at 2:10 p.m. on the 17th of this month for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Addiction Treatment Department Attached to Hongqiao Sanatorium</h3>
<p>No Addiction Treatment Fee Charged</p>
<p>Since the central government strictly prohibited drugs, many citizens in this city have decided to quit opium voluntarily. The Health Bureau has specially set up an addiction treatment center at the Longhua Garrison Command, which has been quite successful. The Hongqiao Sanatorium in western Shanghai uses all the latest modern medical equipment. It has plenty of sunlight and air, and a quiet and clean environment. This kind of natural rural life is very suitable for citizens to quit opium. The hospital has set up an addiction treatment department, headed by the son of Mr. Fu Baolie, the resident director of the De Kang Hospital. Those who are financially strapped will not be charged addiction treatment fees in addition to the hospitalization fee.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The China International Famine Relief Commission's Disaster Prevention Work</h3>
<p>Some say that the China International Famine Relief Commission is a disaster relief organization, so why does it pay so much attention to projects such as road construction, river management, and canal repair? When did these projects start to be implemented? What is their value? How do they benefit the people? And how should they be developed? However, upon examining the history of the Commission's founding and the work it has accomplished over the years, one can feel a new force in Chinese society that is gradually increasing, increasing food production and reducing famine. The China International Famine Relief Commission is an important organization in this new force. The construction work it has completed in sixteen provinces over the years has achieved considerable results, so people at home and abroad have provided financial support. The following is a summary of most of the Commission's projects:</p>
<p>History of the Founding: In 1920, a severe drought struck five provinces in North China, and about 20 million people were starving. In the autumn of that year, American Minister Crane initiated a gathering of people from various countries in Beijing to organize the China Relief Committee. Due to Crane's call, the American Red Cross donated one million US dollars. It was agreed that this huge sum would be used for construction work, starting with road construction, implementing work-for-food. Baker was elected as the Director-General to manage work-for-food affairs in Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces, and with the full cooperation of the provincial governments and the tireless efforts of the staff, all kinds of difficulties were resolved. At its peak, it employed 35,000 yuan. Food was given according to the work done, and many victims were rescued as a result. The 500-mile automobile road in Shandong Province was built in that year. Work-for-food was originally a trial run by the Commission, but it was completely successful. At the same time, other disaster relief organizations in North China provided emergency relief, saving countless lives, but it was not of a permanent nature. In 1921, after the North China relief work, the Chinese and Western leaders of various relief groups decided to set up a permanent organization, and the China International Famine Relief Commission was established. It was decided to focus more on disaster prevention work and not provide emergency relief unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, work-for-food became the Commission's goal.</p>
<p>Restoring the Old Course of the Yellow River: At the beginning of its establishment, the Commission allocated a large sum of money to the disaster-stricken provinces to carry out construction projects. In 1922, most of the road and embankment works in Shandong and Henan provinces were repaired with the Commission's assistance. In that year, the Yellow River breached its banks in Lijin. The management project required 1.5 million yuan. Dams were made with 40,000 cubic yards of stone, and American pine wood was transported from 100 miles upstream as piles. The breached Yellow River was restored to its old course. At the height of the work, about 15,000 workers were employed. The Commission provided assistance of 360,000 yuan. By 1923, the project was completed. As a result, 200 square miles of submerged land were restored to its original state, and 250,000 displaced victims were able to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Relief of the 1924 Flood: In 1924, severe floods struck Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The Gan River flooded, and the embankments on both sides were washed away. North of Nanchang, the delta outside the mouth of the Gan River became a large lake. At the same time, the Yangtze River surged down, breaking the Nantang embankment in Shishou, Hubei, and most of the fields were abandoned. North of Hankou was completely submerged. In July, Beijing experienced incessant rain, which was rare in the past 30 years. Mountain torrents erupted in Shanxi Province. Due to this unprecedented rainfall, the embankments of various important rivers in Hebei Province were almost completely destroyed. About 10,000 square miles of land were submerged. The water conservancy bureaus established by the central government and various provinces, as well as the provinces that suffered this disaster, sent letters to the Commission for assistance. The Commission's engineering division made every effort to serve and fulfill its responsibilities. In 1924 and 1925, the Commission was responsible for repairing the embankments in Hebei, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The government levied special surcharges, and the Commission's provincial branches also collected these relief funds to carry out various disaster prevention works.</p>
<p>Embankment Repair Project in Hebei, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces: In the summer of 1925, the Commission's engineering division carefully built the Shishou Embankment upstream of Hankou, turning long-abandoned fields into fertile fields. It can earn 2 million yuan per year. The labor cost was about 100,000 yuan. In addition, local donations were used to subsidize the civil works. This embankment is covered with stone and is very strong. It can be regarded as a memorial to the Commission's project. In 1927, the Commission had about 20 plans for Hubei's flood control project, costing 1.6 million yuan, half of which was subsidized by the Commission and half was provided by the local government. In the spring of that year, the emergency project of Zhanggong Embankment near Hankou was also repaired, costing 160,000 yuan. In 1925, the Commission repaired many damaged canals and embankments between the Gan River and Poyang Lake. This project cost 200,000 yuan, but the harvest was ten times this number. It can restore the original land value of 20 million yuan. In 1925 and 1926, the Commission planned and managed embankment works in Hebei Province, using 400,000 yuan. In addition to the Commission's engineering personnel, no other organization shared this work. The long embankment in Xidian, 30 miles east of Baoding, and the Qianli Embankment in Yu Wei were all properly repaired by the Commission's engineering division. The following year, the harvest of farmland in that area, in Xidian alone, was worth 5 million yuan. In total, the Commission has completed 904 miles of embankment work in these 12 years.

<h3>Chinese Athletes Are Very Depressed Hard Court Tennis Has Repeated Upsets</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai Lost to Wang Wenzheng in Singles</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Also Gave Up to Carlsen</p>
<p>Lin Zheng Doubles Were Also Defeated by Decca</p>
<p>The 22nd Shanghai Hard Court Tennis Championships, sponsored by the French Chamber of Commerce, have been underway since the 27th of last month. The various championships will soon be over and will enter the finals stage. The finals are scheduled to be held this Saturday and Sunday. In the men's singles, Qiu Feihai surprisingly lost to Wang Wenzheng by two sets to zero in the semi-finals yesterday. Lin Baohua's withdrawal to Carlsen and Zheng Zhaojia's withdrawal to Spandi were even more disappointing. Carlsen and Wang Wenzheng will now compete for the championship. As for the most promising doubles pair, Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia, they were also defeated by Defu and Carlsen in the quarter-finals yesterday, which was also unexpected.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Loses to Wang Wenzheng</p>
<p>In the semi-finals between Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng, Qiu was miserably defeated by two sets to zero, 6-1, 8-6. Wang used fierce serves and smashes, plus net pressure, to make Qiu helpless and at his mercy, losing miserably 6-1. In the second set, Qiu tried to cheer up, and the situation suddenly became tense, each winning five and six games. Wang finally won two consecutive games to win. Wang defeated Yang Baohua in the Youyou Cup, and now he has defeated the old Qiu, which is no easy task.</p>
<p>Lin Zheng Doubles Lost to Decca</p>
<p>The doubles match between Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia against Defu and Carlsen started at 3:45. Both Decca players served extremely fiercely. Lin Zheng seemed dwarfed in comparison. In addition, the two could kill the ball everywhere, leaving Lin Zheng with no way to fight back. The returned balls were not strong enough and were often hit back by Card. In the first set, Defu's performance was outstanding, from 4-2 to 6-3, surpassing the four players. In the second set, Decca's color faded, and Zheng won five consecutive games after being at one to three. In the final set, Lin Zheng lost again 6-2. Zheng Zhaojia made many mistakes, which was very disappointing.</p>
<p>Men's Singles</p>
<p>Quarterfinals Carlsen beats Lin Baohua (withdrawal)</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng beats Spandi 6-1, 6-1</p>
<p>Semifinals Carlsen beats Zhang Dingzhao 6-2, 6-4</p>

<p>Mixed Doubles</p>
<p>Quarterfinals Qiu Feihai and Mrs. Metmore beat Meyers and Mrs. Fish</p>
<p>Defu and Mrs. Moore beat Loran Hui and Mrs. Fuger</p>
<p>Women's Singles</p>
<p>Quarterfinals Mrs. Fish beats Mrs. Kaituo 6-1, 7-5</p>
<p>Mrs. Moore beats Miss Kola Sha 6-3, 7-5</p>
<p>Women's Doubles</p>
<p>The quarter-finals will be held this Saturday. All of them are foreign women, so the details are omitted.</p>
<h3>Charity Match: Hualian and St. Francis</h3>
<p>Hualian Was Inferior to Others by One to Four First</p>
<p>Each Scored Four Goals in the Last Quarter of an Hour</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather was dark and cold, and the water on the dog track had dried up, so it could be used for galloping. The scheduled charity match was held as scheduled. Although it was not a holiday, there were more than 3,000 spectators. The forwards of Hualian are all first-class players in terms of individual skills, but the cooperation is too poor and the short passes are too few, so they often missed opportunities and were at a disadvantage to the enemy. In the 15th minute of the second half, they were inferior to others by four to one. Fortunately, they recovered their lost ground in the last quarter of an hour and created a draw. Li Ning was the only hero on the air defense network, saving two dangerous balls. Zhong Yongsheng's sneaky attack was very likable. Heng Ge was careless and missed quite a few balls. The other generals were just average.</p>
<p>Three Passes Were Lost in Succession</p>
<p>St. Francis' troops were stationed in the eastern suburbs, and Bao Xiutuo launched an offensive to the west. The loyal minister invited him to counterattack. Maisaner found it difficult to return. Qiu Ting tried his skills a little and flew high. Sun's iron legs inquired again, but the road to Tiantai was far away. Zhen Xiang, together with Liang and Chen, broke through the center line. Unexpectedly, the rear was empty, and the enemy's five-front army attacked. After a little maneuvering, the young general Funn got the ball and shot diagonally, scoring the first goal. Hualian attacked bravely. Sun's iron legs shot at the door, but unfortunately, the goalpost bounced back. Yongsen made another wonderful contribution, but Cao and Sun lost the opportunity to give way to each other. Lao Sun came again soon, got the chance and shot quickly, passing the goal line. It was really the number of days. Funn advanced, and A Guan in the inner defense lost his footing and fell into the bitterness. It flew into the China Gate from the upper right corner. Lao Sun went east and penetrated deep into the isolated army, thinking that this trip would be successful, but Tang's guard blocked the road with his calf. What a life! Before long, Funn arrived at a dangerous position again, raised his foot to shoot, Heng Ge's position was not correct, and he actually shot the ball into the net, losing three goals in a row.</p>
<p>Soldiers Had the Determination to Die and Captured the Dangerous City</p>
<p>Three cities were lost in succession, and the soldiers had no face. The fans in the four seats shouted in unison. Chen Hongguang showed his skills on the center back line, constantly transporting ammunition and food. Li Yichen flew, and Remedy fell dizzy. The hairy legs rose together, accurately and urgently. The audience was about to report the lottery, but unexpectedly, it was five inches off and failed to succeed. Cao Qiuting was full of anger, took the ball straight down, rushed to the low line, and passed it into the middle. Lao Sun was about to step forward, but Maisaner blocked him halfway and could not move. Haiguang's ambush suddenly rose and hit the ball head-on, breaking the soup dumpling record. The beautiful skills are gratifying. After that, the offense and defense did not last long, and the rest time arrived.</p>
<p>The Goalkeeper Was Negligent and the Enemy Was Rampant Again</p>
<p>In the sound of the second battle, the enemy's five-front army relied on its flexible and fluent dribbling and repeatedly gave us strong attacks. Li Ning deserves to be called the Chinese Tiger General, passing long and short, and doing his best. Bao Xiutuo saw that the situation was not good, so he secretly gave orders and attacked to the right. Cora Lisha sent a high ball and it fell in front of the door. Xu Heng grabbed a shot, but the ball did not go far, and Xu's feet were long and his legs were fast, and he had exceeded the range of defense. Alger saw this good opportunity, rushed over and dived, declaring success, and the spectators could not help but sigh and sigh, predicting that Hualian's fate would be rough and there would never be a chance to reverse the victory.</p>
<p>Returning the Original to Zhao Was a Joy to Everyone</p>
<p>Only the white clouds and gray dogs are changeable. The Hualian team had been determined to take revenge for a long time, and although they were under the siege of all sides, they would never be discouraged because of this. Yongsheng penetrated deep into the hinterland twice, but both returned in vain because the isolated army had no support. Yichen fell and sent the ball, Xiao Cao ferryed the ball under his feet, Zhong Jun arrived and sent it into the net, making it four to two. Hongguang passed a long ball with one kick, and Yichen headed the ball. Two kicks were lightning fast and captured a city. At this time, the Hualian army's arrogance was overwhelming and it was so hot that it could be handled. Da Zhong was wise and brave, and the quality of the Fuviketov was so good that although he defended like a thief, sometimes the thief also broke into the house. Maisaner regretted that he should not have wiped the oil with his hands, which caused problems, and the penalty was 12 yards. Sun's iron legs swept lightly, creating an even autumn color.</p>

<p>The sports meet held at the Dongya (East Asia) College of Physical Education in Lujiawan, Shanghai, achieved excellent results, as previously reported. Yesterday, the competition continued under clear and sunny weather, boosting the athletes' spirits. However, the muddy ground after the rain slightly diminished the results. Ms. Wang Huachang of the college, due to her scoring in the National Games, was not allowed to compete but was permitted to perform. Yesterday, during her high jump performance, the audience erupted in thunderous applause when she cleared 1.365 meters, expressing their admiration. Later, the bar was raised to 1.385 meters, and Ms. Wang cleared it in one jump, but unfortunately, the bar was brought down by her hand. Nevertheless, she had already broken Zhu Tianzhen's national women's high jump record of 1.355 meters. It is noted that both Zhu and Wang are from Shandong province. Is it that Shandong women are good at jumping high? The detailed results of each event are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Chief of Training Supervision Department, Director Pan, Inspected Jiaotong University Student Soldiers Yesterday</h3>
<p>Satisfied with Their Neat Formation and Skilled Drills</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Scheduled to Inspect Student Soldiers in Hangzhou Within Days</p>
<p>Pan Youqiang, Director of the National Military Education Department of the Training Supervision Department, embarked on an inspection tour to assess the military training achievements in various provinces. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and visited the National Jiaotong University at 2 p.m. yesterday to inspect the entire student military training corps. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Personnel Present: Director Pan Youqiang, Director of Military Training Association Jiao Jihua, Full-time Member of Military Training Association Ouyang Dingming, Dean of Studies of Jiaotong University Jiu Weiyu, Dean of Students Chen Jiaxun, Deans Zhang Tingjin, Li Qianruo, Hu Duanxing, and over 300 military training students.</p>
<p>Inspection Details: The inspection began at 2 p.m., with Chief Instructor Ouyang Dingming as the commander-in-chief, and assistant instructors He Suting, Li Kanru, Xie Xuan, Wang Shanwu, Ding Zirang, and Wang Dao serving as captains. The entire military training student body was divided into two teams, all dressed in yellow woolen military uniforms, cloth leggings, and white gloves, exhibiting a formidable appearance. The inspection included a review parade, squad drills, neat formations, skilled maneuvers, and evident high morale.</p>
<p>Director's Address: After the inspection, everyone gathered in front of the rostrum, where Director Pan Youqiang delivered an address, stating that compared to his inspection of the student military corps last year, there had been significant progress in achievement and spirit, which he found very gratifying. He emphasized that the effectiveness of implementing military-national education had been proven historically, citing the resurgence of Germany and the strength of Italy as examples. Therefore, national and ethnic organization requires the implementation of military-national education. He expressed his satisfaction with the proficiency and morale displayed by everyone.</p>
<p>Inspection in Hangzhou: In addition to inspecting Jiaotong University, Mr. Pan has also inspected other universities in Shanghai, such as Guanghua, Jinan, and Tongji.

Mr. Pan has decided to personally attend for political instruction.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Four: A Cup of Water Reveals the Plight of a Poor Laborer Protecting the Elderly; Ten Thousand Taels Discussed, Cunning Officials Conspire</p>
<p>Zhiqian smiled and said, "You are too kind, old man." He took the earthenware bowl from the old worker's hand and carefully wiped it with a clean piece of paper. Without waiting for the old worker to say anything, he poured the biscuits into the bowl and handed it back, saying, "Don't you like sweet things? These biscuits are very sweet." The old worker took the bowl and said with a smile, "You are too kind to me. I can't refuse. I'll take it back for my daughter." He held the bowl with both hands and bowed twice. Zhiqian smiled and said, "You're too polite. You're making me feel embarrassed." The old worker had nothing to say and smiled at him before leaving. At this moment, a waiter entered the room. Zhiqian thought that since the water in Xiguan was good, the residents would naturally live in the west of the city. He asked the waiter, "Are the houses in Xiguan expensive?" The waiter replied, "Most of the residents live in the west of the city. Does Mr. Cheng want to rent a house? There are too many outsiders coming to Xi'an now, and houses are hard to rent. I can ask someone to inquire for you." Zhiqian said, "I won't be staying in Xi'an for long. What would I rent a house for? I was just asking. I have something else to ask you. Who are the contractors who build houses here? I think that person is quite formidable." The waiter smiled and said, "He used to carry a gun." He lowered his voice and whispered some information. Then he raised his voice and said, "That bricklayer is very pitiful. He's over sixty years old, but he's afraid people will think he's old, so he hasn't dared to grow a beard." Hearing this, Zhiqian sighed twice. He said, "He's so old and still working so hard. He can't even afford a sip of cold water. I feel sorry for him. If I have the chance, I'll help him out. Don't tell him yet." The waiter smiled and said, "You're a good person." Then he whispered, "That girl is also pitiful. You should help her too." Zhiqian smiled and shook his head, saying, "You're wrong. I'm not that kind of person. You want to be a matchmaker." He pointed towards the room next door, and the waiter smiled and walked out.

<h3>Son and Wife</h3>
<p>— By Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>A son is always good, unconditionally one's own.</p>
<p>Although some say, "A son is the fine that romantic comedy gives you," people are mostly happy to pay this "fine," whether they can afford it or not. If someone is "uniquely blessed" and exempt from paying the "fine," he must create pretexts and exhaust all methods to compete for the "fine," and then be satisfied. Things in this world mostly contain contradictions!</p>
<p>After people compete for this "fine," troubles come endlessly. Production costs, childcare costs, education costs, marriage costs, medical expenses for illnesses, and various other expenses, even if you can afford these economically, the mental pain, just the "parents only worry about their children's illnesses" alone, is enough to trouble and exhaust you. Think about it, people endure all kinds of hardships for their own sons without complaint. Why aren't they like this for other people's sons? This is the genuine "love" in human nature. So, when talking about sons, they are always one's own good ones, even if it inevitably involves a bit of bias, but from the standpoint of love, there is an inner truth that must be said.</p>
<p>A wife is not like this; because the component of genuine love in human nature is much less compared to that of a son. The titles of "same quilt" and "same grave" are certainly grand, but husbands mostly like to find fault with their wives, and their faults gradually reveal themselves over time. Although there is inevitably fault-finding perfectionism, the "dissatisfaction" left in the husband's heart is the source of all divorces—in fact, husbands rarely feel completely satisfied with their wives. So they feel that "other people's wives are better." However, the good qualities of other people's wives are not as unconditional as the good qualities of one's own son, so wives can still use magic to catch up with the good qualities of other people's wives, making their husbands feel satisfied.</p>

<h3>Clarification of the Debate on Cattail Shoots and Asparagus</h3>
<p>— By Fufu Sheng</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Nanggong Sheng's discussion of Jinan cattail shoots, written in great detail, there are some slight misunderstandings that I would like to correct. Cattail shoots are a section of the cattail root that is submerged in water. The part that emerges from the water is the green leaves of the cattail. Although it is said to be a specialty of Daming Lake, the output is not large. It relies entirely on the production from Zhangyuan outside the city and other places with paddy fields and ponds in the outer counties, which are transported to Jinan for sale throughout the year, continuously from May to October. This is the time of production, and the price is also cheap. The price is highest in January and February, because farmers select the most tender cattail shoots, store them properly, and can therefore get a good price. As for scallion heads and asparagus, that is simply not true. Cattail shoots and asparagus are completely different. Cattail shoots are aquatic plants, like scallions, with a crisp texture. Asparagus are terrestrial plants, like water chestnuts, with a soft texture. When the Germans occupied Qingdao, a German merchant named Rinner brought vegetable seeds and tried planting them in Hongshiya, Haixi. Among them was asparagus. A few months later, fresh asparagus was sold in the Qingdao market for one dollar per pound. After a few years, Rinner's business failed, and vegetable cultivation also stopped. Since then, fresh asparagus has not been seen in the market. If cattail shoots could be made into canned asparagus, Jinan currently has Taikang and Shanghai Food Company, canned food factories, which produce many kinds of products, such as chicken, duck, beef, mutton, vegetables, green beans, and fruits, which are widely sold in various places. How could they not make asparagus? Moreover, no foreign merchants have been seen changing to buy cattail shoots in Jinan. Qingdao Customs has never heard of cattail shoots being exported. From the above, it can be known that asparagus is not a domestic raw material but is entirely imported, which is beyond doubt. Furthermore, it is said that the annual production of Daming Lake cattail shoots in Jinan is always around one million yuan. This statement is even more wrong. The lake surface of several square miles is mainly used for fish ponds and lotus leaves. Cattail shoots are still in the minority. The annual output is more than 20,000 yuan. If it is cattail shoots alone, it will definitely not exceed 3,000 yuan. The so-called total of one million yuan, I don't know where it is calculated from, is hundreds of times different.

<p>World Rare News</p>
<p>— (Bingyu)</p>
<p>World's Oldest Age</p>
<p>The world's oldest person was originally a Turk named Sal Argan, who lived to be 135 years old. He could remember the past history within a century and a half. He married three times and had five sons, all of whom died on the battlefield. He suddenly suffered a stroke two years ago and could not get up. However, he had said before his death that he could live to 160 years old. His wife, Ahmed Beiyi, is also 135 years old this year. She is now in good spirits. During the Sevastopol War in 1854, she personally visited the battlefield, so the situation she experienced is still vivid in her mind today.</p>
<p>Largest Camera</p>
<p>This time, a very large camera was found in the basement of the Washington Department of Commerce. It weighed 14 tons and was 30 feet long and wide, like an iron bridge. It was made of 37-inch steel and the base was suspended by iron cables. This huge camera is intended for precise aerial mapping photography. The photographer walks into the machine to take pictures, and can develop the film and process the image inside. It is said that the manufacturing cost is US$15,200, and the assembly took two years of engineering.</p>
<p>Total Amount of Gems</p>
<p>The famous gem merchant, Strong Tu Mide, investigated the total amount of all gems in the world, which is 50 tons, with a market value of 70 billion yuan. There are now 500,000 workers engaged in mining gems in mines around the world, polishers, merchants who pack jewelry rings, more than 25,000, and 100,000 stores selling them. Recently, due to the global economic depression, sales have been declining, but in recent years, the use of gems is not limited to decoration, and gems are also used in industry for drilling.</p>
<p>German News</p>
<p>The German News Research Association released a report for the first half of 1934, publicly listing national news statistics. In total, there were 3,097 daily newspapers in the country, with a circulation of 16,687,595 copies, an average of one copy for every 21,000 people.</p>
<p>World's First Bathing Beach</p>
<p>The Poplar Autonomous Region in London, England, has a population of about 170,000. Recently, a large-scale public bathing beach was built in the area. The various facilities are more elaborate than the world's first Vienna bathhouse. The estimated construction cost is 1.7 million yuan. The building has two large bath halls, 86 slipper-shaped bathtubs, and two squares with concert halls, theaters, and dance halls.</p>
<p>Eighty-Year-Old Bride</p>
<p>About half a century ago, a young man named Charlie Edwardwick fell in love with a woman named Elisa Peps Miceworth. Both were rural people. Because their parents were against their union, they each married other people. Time flies, Charlie's waist is hunched, and Miceworth's face is pale. By coincidence, Miceworth's husband died, and Charlie's wife died. They both recalled their past love and remarried. They officially married at the Aikinx Church last summer, and made a vow to grow old together in the same grave. The groom is now 80 years old, and the bride is 75 years old. The union of this couple is unheard of in the world.</p>
<p>Street Without Tobacco</p>
<p>On a certain day, the tobacco in all the tobacco shops on Gare Street facing the Davia Strait suddenly sold out, and the people in the city who smoked were panicked. This was because the entire French territory was affected by the frozen kiln on a certain day. The road from Gare to Pruneux was also impassable, and the tobacco in Gare City was transported from Pruneux once a week. Coincidentally, the inventory of each tobacco shop in the city was sold out, causing a city-wide tobacco shortage.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Deng Fenweng, a genius in the literary world, collected more than 200 pieces of his finest calligraphy and seal carving works made within two years, all framed and matted, and held a solo exhibition at Lake Society.

<h3>The Ethereal Record of Imperial Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After a while, she began to speak. This sentence was addressed to Li Lianying.</p>
<p>"Stop the music!"</p>
<p>Although I didn't know why she suddenly wanted to stop the band's performance, I myself found the notes played by this ancient band to be annoyingly noisy. If it were not for the palace customs, I would have long ago used all kinds of methods to persuade the Empress Dowager to disband them.</p>
<p>Because the Empress Dowager had never shown the slightest annoyance with this ancient band, and she also understood a few old tunes. She always ordered the music to stop when a song had ended. But now, she unexpectedly stopped them suddenly, making them The tune they played was abruptly covered up like someone who had been strangled to death. This situation was of course very abnormal. Therefore, the musicians were all flustered and at a loss. They could not put their instruments back on the rack in time, and hurriedly crawled on the ground, kowtowing desperately, fearing that they had unknowingly violated some criminal law, or that there was an error in the tune they played, causing the Empress Dowager to be annoyed.</p>
<p>But the Empress Dowager did not pay attention to them at all, and muttered to herself:</p>
<p>"Today is the first time we have set foot on this piece of land that truly belongs to us; now, we are back! Let us return to our daily life as before!"</p>
<p>What she said was very simple and touching, like intimate words spoken by an emotional person, unlike an order issued by an Empress Dowager; and the daily life indicated in this order was actually just a kind of prison life that strictly followed the palace system passed down for hundreds of years and was boring to death.

<p>Contribution Words</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu Wenhu and the National Products Enterprise</h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu, a prominent overseas Chinese entrepreneur from Southeast Asia, has come north for observation. The people of Shanghai warmly welcome him, with unprecedented enthusiasm. This demonstrates that running a large enterprise, though seemingly impossible, is still very much viable. Our publication welcomes Mr. Hu from the standpoint of the national products industry, as there are significant reasons for doing so:</p>
<p>The state of the national products industry today is extremely bleak. It is constrained at every turn and burdened by heavy taxes. We do not control tariff rights, and the force of dumping is overwhelming. Ordinary factories face financial difficulties, and their operations are plagued by hidden dangers. When they appeal to the government, the government is unable to help. When they seek assistance from banks, the banks are too busy looking after their own interests. Exchange rates rise sharply for no reason, and sales suddenly stagnate. Foreign merchants, as enemies, not only import goods but also establish factories within our borders to seize our livelihoods and control our fate. Small factories are closing down one after another, and large factories are in precarious situations. The markets everywhere are filled with foreign goods or enemy goods. The people have short-sighted views, and many are solely focused on profit. Consequently, the fate of national products is becoming even more pessimistic. Upon observation, how many Chinese-run factories today are successful? It is painful to talk about and saddening to think about.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu possesses great aspirations and boldness. His enterprises, besides the Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, are all dedicated to serving society and benefiting the people. We sincerely hope that after arriving in Shanghai, he will uphold his spirit of serving society and his grand ambition of benefiting the people. He should promote and invest in the national products industry as much as possible. For the nearly dying national products industry, if it is within his power, we hope he will provide assistance and encouragement. It should be noted that the progress of national products today is different from what it was ten years ago, or even five or three years ago. Many exquisite products clearly have the potential to surpass imported goods. When Mr. Hu observes this, he will surely be surprised and realize it is the result of the national products industry's efforts. The China Production and Sales Association, which leads over a hundred factories, and the more than ten China National Products Companies established jointly with comrades in various regions, are especially noteworthy for their enthusiasm, perseverance, and consistent spirit. Mr. Hu should provide them with strong support to facilitate their progress. When he encounters industries that need to be discussed and factories that need to be maintained, Mr. Hu should not hesitate to help them succeed, as the only way to save China is through the national products enterprise. Since Mr. Hu is deeply patriotic, his love for national products must be even more profound. During the enthusiastic welcome given to him by the city, we offer this humble suggestion for his reference. What does Mr. Hu think?</p>
<p>National Products Contributions</p>
<h3>Some Small Contributions to the National Products Market</h3>
<p>— Yue Xing</p>
<p>Stepping out of a department store that "comprehensively manages global goods" and entering a national products market that specializes in "domestic products," although the "sparkling jewels" of the former cannot compare with the "dazzling array" of the latter, one can still breathe a slight sigh of relief—hoping for its future "daily renewal"!</p>
<p>However, reality will disappoint you even more: the staff's "high and mighty" attitude is no less than those who rely on "foreign brands"; the disharmony between the layout and staff allocation; the lack of meticulousness in handling affairs, etc., can all be found under your scrutiny. Are these things really not necessary or impossible to improve?</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the "staff" aspect:</p>
<p>The staff of a store is crucial to the future of trade; there is no need to elaborate on this. However, the staff of a national products market should especially have a humble and sincere attitude to deal with customers from the "upper-class mansions" to the "low-income apartments," and must never show two different "attitudes" based on people's wealth! But who can guarantee that this situation will not happen? And that it is prevalent! The well-dressed often receive attentive service from the staff, while the honest and simple often face the staff's cold stares, harsh expressions, and neglect. Is this right? Its impact on the future of national products is not insignificant! In the future, I hope that various national products markets will pay more attention to this aspect!</p>
<p>Second, the layout and staff allocation should cater to the psychology of the community.</p>
<p>For example, at a counter selling hats priced at two yuan or a little over one yuan, we can guess that the customers are definitely not gentlemen or young masters, but rather a large group of middle and lower-class brokers (they are the large group in the city and also the main consumers of "broker" hats). Now, having one or two fashionable female staff members supporting this counter will at least violate "their" psychology—or may even make them shy away. (A certain national products market once had the same situation, and as a result, the sales of low-priced goods were extremely poor). Therefore, for low-priced sections, it is best to assign more amiable—or older, more experienced—male staff members, as this would be more appropriate. In addition, the layout of this low-priced goods section should be simple and "practical" in order to easily attract the so-called "middle and lower classes." (We often see that certain foreign low-priced goods can easily penetrate our country's poor classes because they are sold by small shops that do not emphasize luxury).</p>
<p>Third, strive for meticulousness in handling affairs.</p>
<p>When running into any national products market, one often encounters the situation where staff cannot answer the price—or sometimes say a little more or a little less. This is due to the staff's indifference to trade! As for the staff's slow movements (such as arbitrarily chatting with people while the packaging is not completed), casual laughter, and listlessness—the most abominable is that when customers inquire, the staff often reply with the words: "National products are inherently not excellent," "National products are only like this," or falsely claim that the goods are good in order to deceive customers. All of this causes customers to have extremely unpleasant feelings and, as a result, distrust national products. What is the extent of the harm caused by this! Those who run national products businesses should pay attention to this! And there should be adequate training and guidance to these staff members in order to improve their skills.</p>
<p>Today, when foreign goods are dumped and the future of domestic products is bleak, although the above points are minor, many people are dissatisfied with and despise national products markets because of them. I hope that those who run domestic products businesses will not overlook them by "focusing on the small details"!</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3>Deliberations on Trademarks</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jianhua</p>
<p>In these years when everyone is promoting national products, commodity trademarks are indeed very important. For example, the recent trademark exhibition held in Hangzhou displayed various trademarks of domestic and foreign goods, classified and listed side by side, in the hope that the general public would have something to follow when purchasing national products. The depth of this intention and the importance of trademarks in national products can be imagined.</p>
<p>Let's try to discuss this issue in three layers: First, is the use of English in trademarks (mostly English) due to the misconception that Chinese people have a psychology of worshiping foreign things and therefore apply it to domestic products? I believe that "true gold fears no fire," why must we rely on foreign words for trademarks? This can be clearly demonstrated by taking the most famous domestic product manufacturers as examples, such as Kang Yuan Canning Factory, Zhanghua Woolen Mill...etc. Their products are far superior to imported goods. The exclusive use of Chinese characters in a certain country's trademarks at the Hangzhou Exhibition is enough to make us deeply appreciate this. Especially for domestic cosmetics, nineteen out of ten use English decoration, and some even use all English. The general public who intend to buy domestic products but do not understand English all think that they are not domestic products and want to buy them but stop. This is not a false statement, it is indeed what I and many friends have personally experienced. Therefore, in my opinion, domestic products should all use Chinese, and clearly indicating the manufacturer is especially important.</p>
<p>The second issue is "name." I believe that the name of a trademark should be elegant and appreciated by all, known to both the old and the young, and easy to remember. For example, the cigarette trademarks of a certain foreign cigarette company all cater to our national conditions. Some even use the most common and familiar place names as trademarks, which shows how far-sighted they are. However, our domestic product trademarks mostly use foreign names, terms, and Europeanized names, which is really too much to cater to the general public's psychology and even forget our ancestors.</p>
<p>The third is the homophony of names. There has been a lot of controversy over the homophony of trademark names before, which is a very painful thing. It should be known that in this era when our country's industry and commerce have not yet flourished, it is appropriate for everyone to work together with one heart, each with their own responsibilities, to fight against foreign goods and seek a way out. How can we aim to profit for ourselves and promote our own products by borrowing the homophony of other people's well-known trademarks? As long as our own products are excellent and promoted properly, there is no way that they cannot be developed and sold widely in various places.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to put forward a very small but very important matter, that is, please all domestic product manufacturers unite to create a common hidden mark and print it on each product. The simpler, clearer, and more suitable size is the best. In this way, for those who intend to buy domestic products, there will be a definite and unswerving target. The promotion is easy, and the effect is great. Why not do it?</p>
<p>National Products Talk</p>
<h3>Can I Do It Well Alone?</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>I often chat with friends and talk about national products issues: Among them, three friends said very negatively: "Promoting national products is of course our obligation, but is it useful for me to do it alone? Although I personally try my best to use national products and desperately purchase national products, most people in society are not aware and still buy foreign goods, so what's the use of me alone?..." On the surface, this friend's tone seems to be correct, as if there is a considerable reason, but upon careful thought, it is extremely wrong and completely absurd.</p>
<p>Why is this friend's tone wrong and absurd? Because we must know and deeply understand that society is a collection of individuals. Many, many individuals "gather together to create a society, so the individual is the starting point of society and also the backbone of society. It is certainly a good phenomenon that every individual in society becomes aware together, and everyone vows to use national products. Even if a large portion of individuals faithfully use national products and gradually influence others, this is not necessarily a good national products promotion method. Therefore, we cannot despise the individual and say something like 'What's the use of me promoting national products alone?' You must know that from me personally promoting national products, setting an example, and earnestly implementing it, and from me influencing my family, my relatives, and my friends, the effect is really very great! How can we say such unreasonable words?"</p>
<p>Therefore, here, I want to offer an opinion to friends who are enthusiastically promoting national products. When we encounter this kind of friend, we can say to this person with a gentle expression: "As long as you rely on yourself alone, you will definitely do it well. You must value yourself and respect yourself. You see, several prosperous national products factories are so developed because they rely on one of them in the factory, rely on that person alone, and they do it well. Of course, you can do it well too. Don't be discouraged, hurry up and work hard!" If we use these words to deal with others and patiently persuade them, they will definitely be moved, they will definitely correct their wrong ideas, and they will become active. Therefore, "Can I do it well alone?" This sentence, we should overthrow it.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Foreign Goods Import Surplus</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, quickly switch to using national products! Don't hesitate, economic subjugation is imminent.</p>
<p>I will now write down the annual accounts of international trade import surplus—I hope that compatriots will carefully observe them to be alarmed.</p>
<p>1930—More than 414.9 million taels.</p>
<p>1931—More than 540 million taels. Compared with the two years, the year increased by more than 125 million taels.</p>
<p>1932—Imports exceeded exports by 556.60524 million customs taels; this year increased by more than 325.9 million customs taels compared with 1931.</p>
<p>1933—Imports of foreign goods totaled about 130 million yuan, while exports were only about 60 million yuan; from this point of view, imports exceeded exports by as much as 70 million yuan. Isn't it shocking?</p>
<p>Looking at the trade every year, the import surplus of foreign goods increases year by year; if this continues, won't the economy be subjugated? This kind of subjugation is truly unknown to gods and ghosts. Dear compatriots! Wake up quickly! Don't be anesthetized by foreign goods! Aren't you afraid? But this kind of subjugation is even more terrible than the planes and cannons of the Japanese devils.</p>
<p>Dear compatriots! Quickly go to the national products market to diagnose your anesthetic disease! Don't live your leisurely life in a careless way! If you don't wake up again, the country will soon be destroyed in your hands.</p>

<p>Bull and Bear Forces Equal in Gold Market</p>
<p>Daily Fluctuations Result in a Slight Decrease of 1.3 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a decline due to the silver market not contracting and pure gold falling in price. However, the market was still firm in the first half of the day, with high morale. Major players continued to buy, and the overall trend was stable. In the morning, the overseas silver market was stable, exchange rates rose slightly, London raw gold fell by one penny, and the U.S. market was entirely closed, with over-the-counter trading preparing to open slightly weaker, falling back to 96.7 yuan. Buying activity was strong, and the situation was stable. The Central Bank's official quotations showed British and American currencies unchanged, and Customs Gold was down by one li. The standard gold price fell to 989.1 yuan. The morning opened lower, but morale remained high after the opening, and buyers surged, pushing the price above the 1,000 yuan mark. Banks were reluctant, and HSBC's British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. For a time, sellers gathered, and Guangdong merchants also supplied, gradually falling back to within 96 yuan. At this time, there were many who took the opportunity to buy at low prices, with intense struggles. Finally, retail investors helped to increase the selling pressure, and the market weakened slightly. However, due to continued buying by major players, the price was still able to rise. When the Central Bank's silver equalization tax quotation was announced, it fell to 7%, which was 0.25 lower than the previous day (the new low price for the equalization tax), and the price fell again. However, because the Bank of Japan bought U.S. dollars, the domestic market was tightening, and major players came to buy again, with demand exceeding supply. After that, another round of price increases occurred, but it did not exceed the 1,000 yuan mark, and high-priced supply was again abundant. The Bank of Communications and the Central Bank again sold British pounds, causing prices to rise and fall again. In the end, although buying was strong, selling was also strong, so prices rose and fell frequently. The noon closing was low but stable, and the market trend remained volatile. Although the result showed a decline, it was still stable compared to the afternoon closing of the previous day. The trading volume was still over 30,000, with equal strength between the bull and bear sides. Currently, there are 60 firms on each side. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 997 yuan, down 1 yuan from the previous closing. Then, Hengyu, Dafa, Yonghui, Xiangrichang, Senchang, Yongdachangyong, and others issued notes, and the price rose to 1,000.06 yuan. Citibank and Banque Franco-Chinoise sold December U.S. dollars at 33 yuan. Fuxing, Yongsheng, Dawanxing, Hengyu, Dafa, Yongqing, Yuhongxing, Richang, Fuxing, Yongxiang, and Fengdeng successively sold off. Mercantile Bank sold January U.S. dollars at 32.9375 yuan, gradually falling to within 6 yuan. At this time, because Dadecheng, Zhaofeng, Changyuan, Hengyi, Fengyong, and Yifengyisheng had considerable buying interest, there was a big struggle. Retail investors, Hengyu and Dadecheng, sold notes, and the price still fell back to within 6 yuan. Then it dropped to 5.2 yuan, but Yuanmao, Yongbing, Xingdeng and others bought hard, and it rose to 7.4 yuan. Before long, the Central Bank's equalization tax quotation was announced, falling to 7%, 0.25 lower than the previous day. Tianfeng, Zhengchang, Shunli and other sold hard, and the price fell to 5.7 yuan. However, because it was difficult to settle at 33 yuan for recent U.S. dollars, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongri, Changhengyu, Qingyu, Hengchang, Yongda, Fayong and others bought notes, and the price rose to 1,000 yuan. Fuxing, Yongding, Kangyong, Fenghongkangyong and others took the opportunity to supply notes. Bank of Communications and Central Bank sold shillings incessantly, gradually falling back to 5.8 yuan. Qingyu, Zhaofeng, Changdadecheng and others issued notes, and the price rebounded to 7.3 yuan. Shengda, Shunmao, Hengyu, Dafayong, Daxingyong, Hongxingyong and others sold notes, and the price fell to 5.1 yuan. Yongli, Yuanfeng, Yongyong, Hengxing took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the price rose to 7.6 yuan. The noon closing was 996.7 yuan. After the closing, the situation was flat and then stable, rising to above 7 yuan. The highest price in the first half of the day was 1,000.06 yuan, and the lowest price was 995.1 yuan, with a fluctuation of 5.5 yuan. As a result, it fell back by 1.3 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price was the Central Bank's standard gold price, which fell to 989.1 yuan, about 7 yuan higher than the closing price. It was slightly less than the previous closing. The November old standard, with HSBC's U.S. dollar exchange rate unchanged, was equivalent to a gold price of over 1,056 yuan. The registered price for this month was 997 yuan, and for December it was 997 yuan. The morning water supplement was 997 yuan, and the price of pure gold was 1,005.5 yuan. The spot market was still weak. Tianjin merchants sold 1,050 taels to Yingfenghang, only adding 9.5 yuan, and Yingfenghang bought spot, posting swaps. Short seller Fuyu posted 2.5 yuan, 105 notes. The source of spot was very abundant. Buyers had to increase the discount price to sell due to the interest rate relationship.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. Overall, Shengda, Xiangfeng, Tongchun, Dingtai, Tongfu, Fuxing, Yongtianfeng, Dafayong, Chunyuan, Yonghongxing, Shunmao, Dingkang, Zhengchang, Fuchang, Yuanmao, Yongren, Fayongdeng were on the selling side. Yisheng, Yongxiang, Yuanda, Yongyong, Yongli, Tongtai, Changqing, Zhaofeng, Changdadecheng, Huixiang, Shenkang, Renfayongfu, Anbing, Xingfutai, Hengchangsheng, Yongfuyu, Hengyu, Yuanchun etc., Yuanheng, Senchang, Yifengyong, Yuqingyong were on the buying side. Hengxing, Qingyu, and Richang went out first and then in, while Hengyu and Dafayong went in first and then out. In addition, Yuanmao Yong issued many notes, Xiangfeng sold over 1,000 hard, Dalian merchants Wanxing did more than 600 notes in total, barely making a profit, Shunli did 200 notes in total, with no change, Guangdong merchants Shengda sold five or six hundred notes, bought a small number, Hengxing's in and out was not large. The total number of transactions on the day was 33,978 notes.</p>
<p>There were very few November notes remaining. Buyers included Yuanyi with two hundred notes, Fuyu with one hundred notes, Qianchang, Xiangyifeng, Yongyuanheng, Tianfeng, Fuchang, Bingxing, Changsheng, Yongdadecheng, Daxingyong, scattered zeros, sellers included Yingfenghang with five hundred zeros, Dafengheng with one hundred notes, Tongyi and Dingtai with a small number each. The total remaining was 644 notes, with a total of 11 long positions and 4 short positions.</p>
<p>The December lineup was mostly bullish, with Wanxing short of 4,300 notes, Fuchang short of 2,500 notes, Dachangxiang short of 2,300 notes, Yuanyi and Zhengchang above 2,100 each, Changsheng Yong short of 1,500, Senchang Yong short of 1,100, Shunli over 800, Chunyuan, Yongyu, and Xinxian each over 700, Yuanda Yong over 600, Yiyu Bingxing, each over 500, Futai, Hengxing, Yuanyuanmao Yong, Dingkang, each over 400, Ruixing Yongli, Yishengyongheng, Tianfengyong, Hengyu Hongkangyong, Shunmao, each over 300.

<p>Foreign Exchange: British Currency Stable, U.S. Dollar Weak</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants and the Bank of Japan Have Buying Interest</p>
<p>Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Zhejiang Merchants Sell Incessantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. market was entirely closed, and the foreign exchange market only saw London's large notes, both near and far, remaining unchanged. The British-American exchange rate was long at 375, the British-French exchange rate rose by 6 pounds, and London pure gold fell by one penny. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices, with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 875, and the U.S. exchange rate at 33 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, the British currency was stable, and the U.S. dollar was weak at 0.0625. After the opening, the Central Bank's official quotations were announced, with British and American currencies unchanged, and Customs Gold down by one li. Although Chinese merchants had good sentiment, because banks had a strong desire to sell, and HSBC's official quotations were announced, with British and American currencies unchanged, it was difficult to tighten. The Central Bank also supplied slightly, and the underlying trend seemed loose. After entering the market, although the equalization tax was low at 0.25, the foreign exchange market was not affected. The Bank of Japan took the opportunity to buy cheaply, tightening after loosening. However, because the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, and others sold together, the situation finally returned to mediocrity. By the noon closing, the recent selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 875 for the British exchange rate, and 33 yuan for the U.S. exchange rate. Compared to the previous closing, the British currency was stable, and the U.S. dollar was weak at 0.0625. Chinese merchants continued to have buying interest, and the amount of shillings bought was about nearly 100,000 pounds, and the amount of U.S. dollars was over 100,000 yuan. The Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Andar, and Mercantile Bank trended toward selling shillings, while the Bank of Japan trended toward buying. The Bank of Zhejiang trended toward selling U.S. dollars. In addition, Citibank, Shanghai, British, and Banque Franco-Chinoise had mixed buying and selling.

<p>The Current State of the Foreign Market is Increasingly Desolate</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, the silver dollar market has been trending downward. In addition, yesterday was the third day of the horse racing season, and foreign merchants were on holiday, which made the market even weaker. The interest rate for Chinese and foreign merchants remained at 1 jiao for both the morning and afternoon markets, and the head-drawing and water addition were still between 0.02 and 0.03, the same as the previous day. In the morning market, the turnover of bond transactions and new transactions was over 2.6 million, and in the afternoon market, the turnover was over 400,000. The turnover in the small general meeting was over 200,000. The turnover of silver pawn transactions was over 300,000 for redemption and over 400,000 for new transactions.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Bonds Still Traded in Three Sessions with a Range of 0.05 to 0.7 Yuan</p>
<p>—The Rising Momentum of 1996 Gradually Weakens and Degenerates—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained firm and upbeat. Various merchant groups were still very interested in 1996 bonds, and the upward trend seemed to have not yet subsided. However, there seemed to be slight cracks in the evening session, and caution should be exercised against a reversal. Major short sellers were returning and may increase their positions. After the various merchant groups have satisfied their buying interest, there may be a change in the wind. The reasons for the rise of 1996 bonds were mostly due to the rumor that the Exchange Bank would resume operations, and there may be hope for the consolidation of Japanese gold. However, the truth of the matter is still a matter of oversensitivity. Moreover, the domestic part is especially like quenching thirst with plums. The relationship between supply and demand of chips has its limits, so the future cannot be overly optimistic. Yesterday, the entire day was still only traded in three sessions, and the afternoon closing was already past 6 pm. The morning opening saw an even stronger upward trend, with the 23rd pass and other bonds rising by about 0.8 yuan again, and 1996 bonds rising by 0.5 yuan. Morale was very firm. The second session opened at 1:30 pm, and the leading bonds continued to be good by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. Starting from the 20th pass, there was a slight pullback of 0.05 or 0.1 yuan to 0.04 yuan. Mostly, there was a large rise and a small pullback. The leading bonds in the evening session were slightly lower by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan, while the trailing bonds remained firm and stable. The 1996 bonds seemed to have gradually become powerless, and the bulls were gradually coming out of their shells. Near and far terms returned to the same price. The final market price showed a continuation of the rise of 0.05 or 0.1 yuan to 0.06 or 0.07 yuan. The total trading volume was estimated to be around 30 million. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, stock unit: one share).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The Price of Standard Yarn is Unstable, Rising in the Morning and Falling in the Afternoon, with Little Difference in the Final Comparative Price</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The sales of existing yarn are still good, and the buying intention is strong. However, the gold price fell slightly, and the cotton market loosened. Some bulls took profits and closed out their positions. In the afternoon, the market turned downward.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Recovers Before Loosening</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning with a strong lingering atmosphere from the previous day. There were rumors in the market that a certain important person had bought in. At the same time, the gold price was still around 1,000 yuan, and there was less new supply. The market gradually tightened, and the result was that each month rose by 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9 jiao to 1 yuan. The market opened weaker in the afternoon. It was heard that the gold price had fallen back after the morning closing, and some bulls had closed out their positions to take profits. The market price turned loose, and each month fell back by 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, or 0.9 jiao to 1 yuan. The total trading volume for the entire day was 39,100 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,050 bales, Daji sold 400 bales, Yuanda sold 550 bales, Jinchang sold 1,500 bales, Mingde sold 1,000 bales, Changyu sold 1,000 bales, Hengde sold 1,350 bales, Yicheng sold 400 bales, Yichang sold 600 bales, Runkang sold 1,250 bales, Dachang sold 400 bales, and Xincheng sold 500 bales, Runkang sold 1,250 bales, Dachang sold 400 bales, and Xincheng sold 500 bales, Gengfeng sold 400 bales, Renfeng sold 600 bales, and Taichang sold 500 bales.

<p>The sales market for existing yarn is still good. It was found that all the merchants bought a total of 1,265 bales of unified yarn, and the price rose by 0.5 jiao to 1 yuan. The buying volume of each merchant is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 450 Same Industry 105 Henan 135</p>
<p>Guangdong 260 Shantou 160 Wuhu 5</p>
<p>Tianjin 60 Yunnan 20</p>
<p>The Price of Standard Gold Does Not Rise But Falls Back, and Sellers of Standard Cotton Slightly Increase Their Holdings</p>
<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell, and the situation slightly softened. Due to the bullish psychology of the previous day, it was expected that the price of standard gold would continue to rise. However, yesterday's opening price was still flat, but slightly lower, which led to a loss of morale. The powerful sellers still sold out, increasing their holdings. In the afternoon, the market showed a weakening trend.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Also Has Bullish Closing</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, due to the US cotton market being closed and the Indian cotton market not moving, but the buying sentiment in the market was still strong, and the floating empty hedging was especially urgent. The upward trend in the second and third rounds of auction became more intense. However, by the closing of the auction, it was heard that the price of gold had fallen back slightly, and the selling sentiment suddenly became strong. Also, there were bullish closings, falling by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. The result was that the near-term rose by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan, and the far-term fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 90,400 dan. It was found that Hengyi sold 1,000 dan, Dafeng sold 3,500 dan, Yuanda sold 1,400 dan, Dafu sold 1,000 dan, Hengde sold 1,900 dan, Yichang sold 4,400 dan, Runkang sold 2,000 dan, Yuanxingchang sold 1,000 dan, Xincheng sold 1,800 dan, Yifeng sold 1,000 dan, and Changhe sold 2,600 dan. Dafu bought 1,800 dan, Daji bought 1,300 dan, Taixing bought 1,300 dan, Shenji bought 1,900 dan, Renfeng bought 1,600 dan, Tongxing bought 3,600 dan, Changfeng bought 3,500 dan, Xiecheng bought 1,200 dan, Yongchang bought 1,800 dan, Yudai bought 2,300 dan, and Jinchang bought 2,200 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>The Sales of Raw Cotton from Factories is Still Active</p>
<p>The sales of existing cotton is clearer than before. The purchasing power of each factory is still good. The source includes 1,080 bales of Yao cotton and 390 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>British Cotton is Slightly Firm, and the US Cotton Market is Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was closed due to the election, and the price of British cotton futures rose by 6 points. The Indian cotton market was stable due to slight purchases by European exporters. The price of Pingguoer, Aomula, Bairo, and Xijun remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 6th).</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Various Goods Arrive in Droves in Heshia, and the Price of Rice Falls Back by 0.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yangtze Coarse Rice Also Falls by 0.45 Yuan</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various merchants in Heshia was relatively strong, with a total of 70 numbers arriving (more than 10,000 shi of goods in total). The market situation, after the previous market's return, was even more crowded with arrivals yesterday, and morale was even more depressed. As soon as it opened, the situation softened. The outgoing route was sluggish, and sellers with more goods became panicked, which led to a sudden drop in prices, falling frequently until the closing without any return. Although Qingdao merchants purchased 200 bales of late rice, it was ultimately a drop in the bucket and did not help the overall situation. The price of late rice from various merchants ultimately fell by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan, and the price of Yebaidao and other thick new japonica rice also fell by 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. Duyangjian and Yinyuan also each fell by a small 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. Only Chang merchants and Bianyuan were able to maintain a steady price of 0.03 yuan due to the scarcity and aroma of the goods.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 34 or 35 numbers arrived in Heshia. The sales in the market, new japonica rice, broken japonica rice, and Chenbaiyuan were sluggish, and there were few transactions. New sheep Dujian had relatively good sales, and the price of thin rice Yinyuan new Chen Bukejian was average. The market price of new japonica rice high-quality goods fell by 0.2 yuan, and medium-quality goods fell by 0.3 or 0.4 yuan. Broken japonica rice, Yinyuan, and Chenbaiyuan also tended to weaken. The price of thin rice new sheepjian fell by a small 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, and the price of new Dujian also fell by a small amount. There was not much change in the price of new Chen Bukejian.</p>
<p>(Customer Indica Rice) Yesterday, the market situation of foreign customer indica rice was that the purchasing power of local customers was sluggish, but the number of arrivals was strong, and the owners were nervous and sought to sell, so the market unanimously fell sharply. The price of each machine mill indica rice and existing foreign rice fell by a small 0.15 yuan. After consecutive days of rising prices of customer coarse rice, merchants from various places were quite excited, and the number of arrivals gradually increased. The source of goods from Hankou and Shashi was even greater. Yesterday, the opening price of Yangtze coarse rice in the morning was still 9.45 yuan, then it fell from 9.35 yuan to 9.27 yuan, and in the afternoon it even fell to 9 yuan. In one day, it fell sharply by 0.45 yuan. Moreover, the goods were similar, and the price did not fall due to differences in the quality of the goods. It was actually because the previous price increases were too high, which led to competition among merchants. Now the merchants are competing to close out their positions first, and the market has unexpectedly reversed. Although other types of rice all fell in price, they were not as drastic as the fall in Hankou coarse rice. The overall market released 1,500 bales of Saigon rice and 1,800 bales of Hong Kong Siamese broken rice machine rice. The foreign rice futures market did not sell and returned 0.06 or 0.07 yuan. It is estimated that 100 tons of Saigon rice in March and 100 tons in November were distributed to the inland areas of this street.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Bullish Buyers Returning</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat flour market in the morning, the prices for each month showed a stable trend. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago was closed due to the election, Canada was good for 0.45 yuan. When the price was opened, the bullish trend from the previous day was strong, and the outside bullish buyers had turned to wait and see. The speculative bullish buyers in the market were also returning, because the momentum had waned, so although the opening price rose slightly by 0.005 yuan, it gradually returned to flat. By the afternoon opening, the trading volume in each session suddenly became sluggish, with only 120,000 to 130,000 transactions in half a day. Also, because the price of rice rose and then fell, each stall fell by 0.3 or 0.4 yuan, so morale was not good. Outside bullish buyers were also returning, so the near and far markets turned into a sluggish trend. As a result, the price for this month fell by 0.0125 yuan, the price for December fell by 0.025 yuan, the price for January fell by 0.075 yuan, the prices for February and March fell by 0.015 yuan, and the price for April fell by the same amount.</p>
<p>The Futures Wheat Market's Fall is Still Small</p>
<p>The Price of High-Quality Existing Wheat is Called Higher by 0.02 or 0.03 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month showed a mixed trend of rising and falling. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago had no market, Canada was good for 0.45 yuan, so after the opening price, the morale in March was slightly better by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. However, the prices for each distant month did not change much, because there were few buying and selling. By the afternoon of each session, the price for this month was still flat at first, and then it fell slightly by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan because the wheat flour market softened. The prices for each distant month were still not very smooth, and the market price fell back by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. The crux of the matter in the future will ultimately depend on whether the price of foreign wheat continues to be stable. As a result, the price for this month was good for 0.01 yuan, the price for December was small for 0.01 yuan, the price for January was small for 0.01 yuan, the price for February was small for 0.02 yuan, and the price for March was good for 0.04 yuan. In the existing wheat market, the purchasing power of the factories is still good, and the price of high-quality goods is called higher by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. Because the bottom code is gradually thinning, there is no trend for the subsequent steps to be too small. The price of Shandong Xuzhou Bengbu wheat is 3.9 yuan, the price of Jiangbei wheat is 3.82 yuan, and the price of Yangzhou wheat is 3.87 yuan, estimated at 8,000 bales, with Fuxin taking 1,000 bales and Fufeng taking 7,000 bales.</p>
<p>The Chicago Wheat Market is Closed on the 6th to Hold Elections for Congressmen and Governors</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Eager to Sell Raincoat Fabric</p>
<p>The transaction of raincoat fabric with local customers is all light, and the selling price is consequently weak. The yarn of eastern goods is more than one yuan, and the single-sided of western goods is 4026. Except for boiled American goods, the market situation of other kinds of thick and thin, male and female colored raincoat fabric is all slow. Those with silver lattice elephant skin linings are getting worse, and even the extra cheap ones are rarely sold. Yesterday, the wholesale price of single-sided boiled American goods was shouted to be 5.2 yuan per yard, the number one of brushed thin goods was 3.5 yuan, the deputy number was 3 yuan, and if there was a recipient, they all hoped to get it sooner or later.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of the Shanghai Rosewood Furniture Industry</h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>An Unbearable Look Back at Bygone Days</p>
<p>In Shanghai's rosewood furniture industry, there are over a hundred businesses, large and small. However, the turnover for the past ten months is only worth over 600,000 yuan, a sight unseen in the last forty years. Rosewood furniture is, after all, a luxury item, and with the decline of people's livelihoods, it's naturally difficult to sell well. In the recent decade, Westerners and Japanese have been quite fond of it. In 1930, rosewood furniture shipped to Japan was worth over 1.2 million yuan, while that to Europe and America was worth about 5-600,000 yuan. By 1931, exports to Japan remained largely unchanged, but those to the West were only worth over 100,000 yuan. By 1932, exports to Japan were less than 30,000 yuan, and those to the West had also dropped to around 10,000 yuan. This year, neither Japanese nor Western firms have made any purchases. Occasionally, there are only small, scattered pieces. Inquiries to stores like Qiaoyuantai and Tao Yongren can give an idea of the overall situation.</p>
<p>The most prosperous era for the rosewood furniture industry was during the late Qing Dynasty. Opium dens and gambling houses were the main customers at the time. After 1924, items such as zither tables, nesting tables, dragon head stands, clock stands (for hanging round copper mirrors), snuffboxes, writing trays, canes, etc., were all favored by Europeans and Americans, especially Americans, who were particularly fond of them. For clock stands alone, each export batch was always around 2-30,000 pieces. Later, a trend of devaluation and competitive selling emerged. Coupled with the fact that unemployed workers purchased small pieces of lumber and manufactured them at home, standing at the doors of foreign firms and peddling them to foreigners at low prices, items that used to cost over three yuan each now sold for only two yuan, or even one yuan each. Foreigners competed to buy them, and as sales increased, so did the number of manufacturers, and prices continued to fall, while the quality of goods deteriorated further and further. Ultimately, they were rejected by foreigners, which was a major cause of their failure. Also, the rise of Western-style furniture, the emergence of the steel furniture industry, and the popularity of iron beds led to the gradual decline of the rosewood furniture industry.</p>
<p>The Shanghai rosewood furniture industry is divided into two categories: one is the rosewood dowry industry, specializing in large rosewood furniture; the other is the rosewood small pieces industry, specializing in various small rosewood items. It's entirely handicraft-based, and traditionally dominated by people from Yangzhou. In the past twenty years, people from Menghe, Jiangyin, have risen to replace them. Internally, the industry has polishing workshops and lacquering workshops, but no woodworking workshops. This is because the manufacturing of rosewood furniture is outsourced to the white wood body industry. The rosewood furniture industry orders from the white wood body industry, then polishes and lacquers them for sale. The polishing work is particularly important to the industry. The price of the same item can vary greatly, often depending on the quality of the polishing. China's manufacturing of rosewood furniture began in the Ming Dynasty. The wood initially came from Annam, but recently, it's mostly imported from Siam. The price is measured by weight, around 18 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). In recent years, rosewood and fragrant rosewood have also come from Siam, but their quality and texture are inferior, and the price is also lower. However, since the prevalence of Western-style modern furniture, rosewood furniture manufacturers, in order to cater to the psychology of buyers, often inlay the surface of rosewood furniture with burl wood patterns to enhance its beauty. The burl wood is often mistaken for decayed wood, but burl wood is burl wood, and decayed wood is decayed wood. The business of trading these wood materials is the rosewood disassembly industry.</p>

<h3>On the Lives of Literati During the Wei and Jin Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In those two hundred years from the first year of Zhongping during the reign of Emperor Ling of the Han Dynasty (when the Yellow Turban Rebellion began) to the first year of Yuanxi during the reign of Emperor Gong of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (when the Jin Dynasty fell), the death of a person or two was not something to be concerned about. As early as the reign of Emperor Huan of the Han Dynasty, "the dead in the capital were piled upon each other, and in the counties, they were everywhere in the fields." By the early Eastern Jin Dynasty, "the Central Plains were desolate, with no smoke for a thousand miles; the hungry and cold wandered and fell into ditches one after another." "Yanling used to have fifty to sixty thousand households, but now there are only a few hundred." What a great Asura field this was! But historians did not seem very concerned about the life and death of these people. The deaths of a few literati were written about in great detail, leaving a deep impression on later generations. The practice of the authorities executing literati began with Huang Zu killing Mi Heng. Cao Cao followed suit and killed the talkative Kong Rong. Cao Pi also killed many literati, and if it weren't for the brotherly love, even Cao Zhi would have almost been unable to escape. (In fact, brotherly love didn't matter much to Cao Pi: the Prince of Rencheng was killed by Cao Pi.) At the end of the Three Kingdoms period, those famous scholars, Sima Yi, killed two—Xiahou Xuan and He Yan, and Sima Zhao also killed one—Ji Kang. Their crimes were roughly the same: unfilial piety. However, Zang Rongxu said in the Biography of Ruan Ji in the Book of Jin: "During the transition from the Wei to the Jin Dynasty, the world was full of disasters, and few famous scholars survived. Therefore, Ruan Ji did not engage in worldly affairs and became addicted to drinking. ... Zhong Hui asked him about current affairs several times, wanting to use his approval or disapproval to accuse him, but he always escaped because of his drunkenness." This is the truth. We all know that Cao Cao, Cao Pi, Sima Yi, and Sima Zhao were not loyal ministers or filial sons themselves; using "unfilial piety" to kill those famous scholars was just a pretext.</p>
<p>Someone might ask Cao Cao and Sima Yi: Why did you have to execute literati? Let's first talk about a few foreign stories: Why couldn't the Greeks, a nation that prided itself on freedom, allow the great philosopher Socrates to live a few more years? Socrates was already seventy-one years old when he died, and he would have died sooner or later; the Greeks were in such a hurry to get rid of this person. Socrates did not commit any major crimes; he only questioned people, arousing young people's doubts about the status quo and preventing the Greeks from continuing to live in a drunken dream. Therefore, the three people who accused him, Meletus, etc., said that he "denied the gods recognized by the state, sang of new gods, and corrupted the youth of Athens." This is one thing. Another thing happened during the French Revolution, a figure we Chinese are most familiar with: Madame Roland. When she was about to die, she said to the statue of the goddess of liberty: "Liberty! Liberty! How many crimes have people committed in your beautiful name!" Her husband committed suicide the same day after hearing the news of her murder; he left a small note, saying: "I hope that the whole country will abandon this heinous crime of killing the innocent and turn around to discover true humanity!" Both she and her husband had the habit of lecturing others, and they never realized it until they died! The literati of the Wei and Jin dynasties probably suffered from the same problem of being talkative, and they had to express a long and short reason for everything, even reciting the Classic of Filial Piety to the Yellow Turbans; "It's impossible to reason with soldiers," who would bother listening to your nagging? When we read Ji Kang's letter to Shan Juyuan, we find it ridiculous: what "seven unbearables," what "two impossibilities," only cause headaches, and thus send him to the guillotine. Even the so-called pastoral poet Tao Yuanming could not avoid this problem (such as Miscellaneous Poems, Imitating the Ancients, and Reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas, there is anger and resentment in every word); let alone other literati. Under certain circumstances, it can be said that the unfortunate ending of literati is destined!</p>
<p>Their method of escaping reality seems quite humorous to us. Among them, three ancient books were popular: Laozi, Zhuangzi, and the Book of Changes. Laozi and Zhuangzi both taught people to return to a state of chaos where there is no right and wrong and no difference: "Never taking the lead, but always following others; everyone takes reality, but he alone takes emptiness; everyone seeks happiness, but he alone seeks completion." If people don't know that the human heart is like a mirror, once it reaches a state of emptiness and stillness, even secrets can be seen clearly: it is better to muddle along in the world of profit and power, truly able to be in darkness, not seeing the light of day. In this way, they wanted to find a hiding place in Lao-Zhuang philosophy to settle down, but as a result, they saw right and wrong more clearly and were even less able to settle down. Their second method of escaping reality was drinking. When Sima Zhao wanted to propose marriage to Ruan Ji on behalf of Sima Shi, Ruan Ji was drunk for sixty days, making it impossible for the envoy to open his mouth. Escaping by drunkenness was only effective this one time. Later, when Sima Yan let go of the Nine Bestowments, the dukes and ministers wanted to urge him to advance. Ruan Ji was ordered to write the persuasion, whether or not he wanted to. Ruan Ji also wanted to escape by drunkenness, but it was impossible after all; he had to write it on the spot and let the envoy copy it. Ji Kang probably didn't approve of Ruan Ji's method, so he said: "Ruan Sizong; only drinks excessively; until he is bound by the scholars of etiquette, hating him like an enemy..." Because people like Ji Kang would become silent when drunk; Ruan Sizong was originally "harmless to things," but after drinking, he would become abnormal and cause trouble. The third method of escaping reality was to enter the mountains to cultivate the Tao and learn to become immortals. But the more effort one put into cultivating the Tao, the more venomous one became. Sun Deng, who was hidden in Su Men Mountain, bluntly said that Ji Kang "had much talent but little knowledge and would not end well"; fortunately, Ji Kang was not a person who wanted to serve the ruler, otherwise Sun Deng himself would not have ended well. All the methods of self-anesthetization and escape used by the literati of the Wei and Jin dynasties were ineffective, and they could only be like ostriches, burying their heads in the trees, thinking that they had hidden themselves, letting the hunters catch them and slaughter them.</p>
<p>After the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Buddhist thought spread, and the teachings of Shakyamuni replaced the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi. The most intelligent people all became monks; they had great things to do in another world and did not have to mix with reality, which was true escape. Moreover, in another world, everything in the human world would be fairly and justly reckoned from scratch, and all the anger and resentment would naturally subside. Therefore, to escape reality, it is difficult to be effective by relying on self-anesthetization alone. The most important thing is to be able to have another universe to go to, like the Buddhists. That would be relatively safe.</p>

<h3>Autumn Love</h3>
<p>— Lao Yi</p>
<p>It seems someone once said: spring is like a "lover," while autumn is like a "beloved." That is to say, while the liveliness of spring is certainly lovely, the depth of autumn is especially lovable!</p>
<p>I have never been someone who loved spring much; but I truly love autumn. Just as I usually don't love Li Bai when reading poetry, but love Du Fu, and don't love Maupassant when reading novels, but love Turgenev, it's the same feeling.</p>
<p>Often, I feel, feel the idle thoughts in a guest house, the courtyard at dusk, the phoenix trees in the courtyard, the evening breeze on the phoenix tree leaves, the endless desolate melody coming from the evening breeze! It feels that life is just like this scene.</p>
<p>Plus, the lonely railings, the faint autumn water outside the railings, the fishing boats on the water, the evening songs of the fishermen, the evening songs echoing the distant mountain village, the faint shadows of smoke lingering in the mountain village, a few yellow leaves and red maples locked in the shadows of smoke, the sound of the wind gradually presenting a kind of mournful color! Waves of returning birds, waves of barking dogs, waves of the noisy sound of aggrieved women's laundry mallets, this universe, this life, all of this, you can fully savor! Fully chew! When you chew, you will know, know that the universe is inside, life is inside, everything is inside.</p>
<p>Life is only a few decades. People who have passed thirty already feel that half a lifetime has passed, like the sun that has set to the west: gradually passing, gradually declining. Just like in the middle of the four seasons of the year, if autumn passes, the appearance of all things will be aging day by day, decaying day by day! Can you not feel sad?</p>
<p>People over thirty have tasted all the flavors of the world, and autumn, in the seasons, can be considered to have experienced many misfortunes; therefore, life at thirty makes people nostalgic; autumn in the year is even more nostalgic!</p>
<p>Now, late autumn is coming to an end, and the season is slowly approaching winter. I am already thirty-one years old. I am reluctant to part with autumn, I am reluctant to part with the age of thirty, I deeply feel that autumn is gone, but it will come again; what is there after the age of thirty is gone?</p>
<h3>The Ulaqi Desert (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>When the sun came out, a group of people drove livestock from the Nukutai Plain into the Ulaqi Desert.</p>
<p>The Ulaqi Desert is like a calm sea, flat and boundless. The night's wind had long stopped, and the sky was clear without clouds. The sunlight gradually radiated heat. People, camels, horses, cattle, sheep... a dark mass, began to wriggle, the winding line like a long snake. Treading forward.</p>
<p>Bagu Like, riding on a camel, whose usual full of spirit has completely disappeared, hangs his head, wondering what he is thinking? His daughter, Tanila, hit the butt of the camel he was riding with a whip.</p>
<p>—Dad! Can Dali Gangai be reached today?</p>
<p>He raised his head, glanced at his daughter, didn't say anything, squinted his eyes, lowered his head again, and simply closed his eyes.</p>
<p>—Dali Gangai of Heaven ah!</p>
<p>Hope climbed like an ant on everyone's heart, a heat from the depths of the heart, exciting the blood of the whole body, wild imagination in everyone's mind.</p>
<p>The hotter it got, the sun beat the desert hotly, beat people, beat livestock, beat this group of columns, everything was suppressed by the heat. People were sweating profusely, the women's upper clothes were soaked in sweat, tightly clinging to the flesh, and the breasts were clearly visible under the halter. The horse's mouth foamed white. The sheep jumped and bleated. The dog dragged its tongue and panted, running for a while and resting for a while. The camels and cattle were soaked in sweat all over their bodies, shining in the sun.</p>
<p>People's breathing, children's crying, old women's complaints, sheep's wailing, the sound of livestock hooves, ... all kinds of different sounds mixed in the sultry air and swelled up.</p>
<p>They were silent, looking with eyes that hid hope and joy, at the sea-like, flat, vast desert that was connected to the sky.</p>
<p>No one can stop the thoughts, Dali Gangai Heaven is always jumping in the brain, jumping non-stop.</p>
<p>...Dali Gangai, where there are palaces, pavilions, houses, rice to eat, winter without snow, without wind, always warm, the grass is always lush no matter when; this is what the Lama requested of the heavenly gods by the order of Bayan Khan. The gods loved us so much that they gave us this beautiful paradise—Dali Gangai...—When Bayan Khan's envoy, Noyin, announced this news to everyone, who did not envy it? When Bayan Khan then ordered Noyin to lead everyone from the Nukutai Plain to Dali Gangai, everyone was so happy that they jumped up and down. Now they are savoring Noyin's words, hope has become a beautiful flower, spraying sweetness and fragrance in everyone's heart.</p>
<h3>Wanderer (1)</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>A dark August afternoon sky.</p>
<p>After the engine roared the first time, the switchman spat out a monotonous phlegm, tapping his leg with a green flag, and slowly walked towards the gate. The quiet little station was suddenly bustling. Cold food vendors, cigarette sellers, children and women selling boiled water... looked towards the smoky distance, waiting for passenger train number eighty-two.</p>
<p>The short old man squatted down, as if he didn't hear those sounds. At the entrance to the station platform, he spread out his satchel as usual. A station attendant in uniform brushed past him and suddenly slapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Friend, estimate half a catty of white shochu. This time, I won't be stingy."</p>
<p>Saying that, he ran in.</p>
<p>"Oh? Okay, okay... naturally."</p>
<p>Even though he responded, he didn't lift his head.</p>
<p>There was a lot of ash on his beard. Even in August, large beads of sweat oozed from under his somewhat crooked nose. The two buttons of his collar were undone, revealing his purplish-brown collarbones. A felt hat covered his round head, so tattered it looked like a lotus leaf; the brim hung straight down, covering his unusually wide jawbones. No matter how you looked at his haggard appearance, he would never look more like a weary traveler.</p>
<p>Those passengers, mostly belonging to villagers or small merchants, were not noble. Dragging their muddy feet, carrying their tattered luggage, they exhaled a big breath of dark air, wiped their faces covered in coal cinders, and walked lazily out of the entrance.</p>
<p>"Nanhai Guanyin Incense Wafer, (Note) whether paralysis or injury, all kinds of diseases, incurable for years... Are there old people and young children at home?... Three packs are good, five will get rid of the root."</p>
<p>He solicited business in the accent of the Huai River basin; repeatedly muttering, his voice low and lazy. Proving that he was an unadulterated drunkard.</p>
<p>He clearly understood the passengers' weakness: they had toiled for half a year or several years in foreign lands, accumulated some money in their hands, and wanted to go home to see their elderly parents and hardworking wives. Because of poverty, illness would quietly invade their bodies. Only these people had futile filial piety. Going to the hospital to hire a doctor? Unable to. Herbalists also rarely went to the countryside year-round. In order to fulfill their human responsibilities, the young and middle-aged would spend a few dollars. So he squinted his eyes slyly, and his schemes were aimed at this void.</p>

<h3>Yi Peiji's Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was sitting in my garret when I heard an old woman next door scolding someone. I didn't understand most of it, but I clearly heard her say, "You little rascal, your sins are overflowing, one day you'll walk right into the net." This reminded me of Zheng Zhuang Gong's saying, "Those who commit many unrighteous acts will surely destroy themselves," and Confucius's saying, "Goods that enter improperly will also leave improperly." This is just the way of heaven and earth. The more I thought about the old woman's words, the more sense they made.</p>
<p>Later, I thought about it again, and the old woman's words were an absolutely deterministic view, which is somewhat wrong in the current trend. Now we advocate the theory of human rights and the theory of utilitarianism (forgive my misunderstanding of these two theories). Humans can definitely conquer heaven, and humans should conquer nature. Whoever is strong, who goes to occupy. Whoever has power, who gets to seize territory and snatch jobs. What is called benevolence, righteousness, morality? What is called abiding by the law? These are mostly arguments used by the strong to deceive the weak.</p>
<p>Yi Peiji served as the director of the National Palace Museum in 1929, and Li Zongtong served as the secretary-general. They successively stole parts of the jewelry in their custody, including 1,319 pearls, 526 gems, and replaced 9,606 real pearls with fake pearls, and 3,251 real gems with fake gems. In addition, they disassembled jewelry accessories from 1,496 original items. They also stole entire items, such as silk tassel made of rice pearls and jadeite flower inlaid with jeweled bracelets. The amount was huge, all of which they appropriated for themselves. There were many other cases of encroachment, forgery, and obstruction of official duties, which cannot all be listed.</p>
<p>Now the prosecutor of the Jiangning District Court has completed the investigation and filed a lawsuit. A person like this who steals from himself is guilty of heinous crimes and should be immediately arrested and brought to justice for interrogation. However, Yi Peiji uses the concession as a protector and traitors as a guarantee. It is feared that it will not be easy to arrest him, just like "a robber falling into the sea," where to catch him. He can live a life of leisure outside the law, and spend his days as a parasite in the concession, living a life of ease and wealth.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Tianjin yesterday: Yi Peiji is hiding on Langsu Street in the Japanese concession of Tianjin, and is extremely unfree. Hoodlums and thugs extort him every day. Zheng Xiaoxu, the rebel, believes that the treasures of the Qing imperial family should belong to the Qing imperial family. He previously sent Japanese An Tianshida, a pseudo-State Council affairs official, to Tianjin to demand most of the treasures from Yi Peiji. Yi was extremely resentful because of this. If that were really the case, then Yi Peiji's petty theft was all in vain, benefiting others. Even I feel a little resentful for him when I think about it.</p>
<p>Then I thought again about the old woman next door's words, "Little rascal, your sins are overflowing, one day you'll walk right into the net." Although the day when sins are overflowing and walking into the net has not yet arrived, that day will always come. Now I see that there are many people like Yi Peiji. Let's take Yi Peiji as an example and ask everyone to take a look.</p>
<h3>Cleverness</h3>
<p>— Dan Ran</p>
<p>"Cleverness" is of course two good words. Ever since we understood the words of the human world, we have often hoped to be "clever." In particular, parents' desire for their children to be clever can be said to be an almost universal sentiment. However, Su Dongpo said: "Everyone wants their son to be clever, but I have been misled by cleverness all my life. I only hope that my son will be foolish and stupid, and live carefree until he becomes a high official." Many people say that Su Dongpo was a talented scholar, and talented scholars must be clever, but he insisted on saying "I have been misled by cleverness all my life." Then the value of the two words cleverness is a bit doubtful. I know that clever people can certainly say: "Su Dongpo was just clever in reading and writing articles, not clever in penetrating the ways of the world. No wonder he couldn't be a good official and was eventually exiled to death." From general opinion, we can easily find the concept of the two words "cleverness," which is "penetrating the ways of the world, and being adaptable."</p>
<p>However, Confucius had a further analysis. He said: "Great wisdom is like foolishness." From this sentence, we can find two key points: First, wisdom is cleverness. Since there is great cleverness, there is naturally petty cleverness. Then the cleverness mentioned earlier is of course petty cleverness. Second, since great cleverness is somewhat like foolishness, it is naturally difficult for ordinary people to see it. Like Columbus going to the boundless ocean to find land, Watt seeing the pot lid being lifted by boiling water were all considered rare and strange. Before the New World was discovered and the steam engine was invented, clever people would laugh their heads off at the foolishness of Columbus and Watt.</p>
<p>Again, Confucius also said: "Only the highest wisdom and the lowest stupidity are immutable." We can also know that since people with great cleverness and stupid people are both somewhat stubborn, their unsuitability to the times is evident. We can know even more that petty clever people are always "changing allegiances." It is natural for them to be opportunistic and hopeful of advancement.</p>
<p>The Chinese are uniquely blessed, and there are indeed many clever people. There are also a considerable number of people who are not clever but pretend to be clever, but unfortunately, they are all petty clever, with more than enough adaptability and not enough stubbornness. Therefore, the country, society, and even the literary world are in a mess.</p>
<h3>Third Sister</h3>
<p>— Village Cause</p>
<p>Yesterday; the sunshine was very bright, fresh!</p>
<p>Third Sister returned yesterday, bringing her young daughter.</p>
<p>When she came back, she said to me with surprise:</p>
<p>"Ah! You've grown so tall! It's only been a little over two years since we last met."</p>
<p>A little over two years since we met, Third Sister already had a daughter, and she had aged!</p>
<p>I didn't dare to stir her sorrow, so I only said:</p>
<p>"Time really flies!"</p>
<p>(What season was it, I can't remember! At that time, it was when the pomegranates were in bloom.</p>
<p>—Third Sister! When are you getting married? Soon! Haha.</p>
<p>Those who ran into her always joked with her.</p>
<p>One day, Mom took out a new dress that I had worn once from the trunk for me.</p>
<p>—Cause, tomorrow is the day Third Sister is getting married, you have to go to the wedding!</p>
<p>The next day, I watched her being carried away in a bridal sedan!</p>
<p>I also watched Third Sister's mother, with tears in her smiling face, saying as Third Sister was about to get into the sedan:</p>
<p>—Third Sister! You must take care of yourself!</p>
<p>I heard this sentence very clearly: like the crow's caw in the early morning.</p>
<p>After that:</p>
<p>In the first year, Third Sister did not come back. The news came:</p>
<p>She gave birth to a baby girl.</p>
<p>In the second year, Third Sister did not come back. The news came:</p>
<p>—Her husband fell to his death!</p>
<p>In the third year, Third Sister came back! She brought a story:</p>
<p>—...My husband was a plasterer, his temperament was very gentle, I was married to him for over a year, and we never argued once! Poor him, he fell from a very high five-story building. Dead! God! This western-style building... is a monster! It, it swallowed my husband alive....</p>
<p>Third Sister returned yesterday, bringing her young daughter.</p>
<p>—Third Sister! Are you having a good time in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Speaking of Shanghai, she would become sad and say:</p>
<p>—Shanghai is an execution ground! Sinful, heartbreaking...</p>
<p>Her face resembled that of a lost companion goose: haggard and melancholic.</p>
<p>—Third Sister's fate is not good!</p>
<p>The Third Sister of two or three years ago, was beautiful!</p>
<p>The Third Sister before my eyes is like a withered branch.</p>
<p>—She is only twenty-one years old!</p>
<p>(Poor, young widow! Your life is simple.</p>
<p>The fine-looking chastity arch stands erect, smiling insincerely, saying:</p>
<p>—Come! Third Sister! Join us!)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sunshine was very bright, fresh!</p>
<p>(It was the day Third Sister returned.)</p>
<p>Today, it is raining continuously. Washing everything on this earth.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow... let's wait and see! However, Third Sister always curses those tall western-style buildings.</p>
<h3>Anemia</h3>
<p>— Yu Renying</p>
<p>Two children, silently; jostling on the public bus. A bunch of fresh flowers, a basket of apples.</p>
<p>The bus turned onto a quiet road. The low western-style houses on both sides, inside, wallpapered with Parisian floral paper, could be seen through the bus windows; fleshy White Russian women were applying lipstick.</p>
<p>Getting off the bus, groping on the unfamiliar road. The five characters "×× Sanatorium" jumped into our eyes, asked the doorman.</p>
<p>"Where is the first-class ward?" Found the third floor, bumped into a white-clad angel in the corridor.</p>
<p>"Which room is Miss Wang ×× in?" She asked me for a calling card, we waited at the doorway. After she came out,</p>
<p>"Can we go in?" She nodded. White powder walls, white iron bed, white bedding...; facing a sunny window.</p>
<p>"Who told you I was here?" I gave a knowing smile.</p>
<p>"Anemia, this popular disease!" Her face was indeed much thinner, just last week I saw her knitting a wool sweater at home.</p>
<p>"Is the environment here good?"</p>
<p>"Good enough. I go to the garden for a sunbath every day. Now I can only eat things like cod liver oil, fruit, and eggs."</p>
<p>Sitting by the south-facing window, watching the dwarf holly garden path, white-clad angels, white-clad patients; breathing in the faint sunlight of the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>"I'll come see you again on National Day, I hope you recover soon." We shook hands tightly. Jumping on the number nine public bus, the carriage was quiet.</p>
<p>The torrent of the city, makes everyone fall into the death line of anemia. Facing the lonely street scene, deeply sighing.</p>
<p>Thinking of one's own situation struggling for life while sick; a paradise for the bourgeoisie to recuperate flashed before my eyes again.</p>

<h3>A New Method of Buying National Products</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Chinese science is undeveloped, industry and commerce lag behind others, and various products are rarely improved, so most are not as good as others. Generally, people naturally want to use a better item, so those foreign goods are happily used by Chinese people. But I don't think Chinese people necessarily have to buy foreign goods. If domestic goods can improve, and clerks can pay attention to promoting domestic goods, and try to introduce the benefits of domestic goods to them, then they will also change their habit of buying foreign goods. Speaking of this, some clerks must say: "Promoting domestic goods is the responsibility of the government, industrialists, shop owners, and all customers. We clerks are just doing what we are told, without any freedom to exercise our will. Where would there be an opportunity to promote domestic goods? And if we did work outside of our duties, then there is always the risk of losing our jobs!" This statement, on the surface, seems to have considerable reason, but based on my few years of experience, when actually studied, it is not necessarily so. I feel that it is very suitable to promote domestic goods from the position of a clerk, and there are many convenient places. Now I am writing my experience below, hoping that clerks and other readers will have a thorough discussion.</p>
<p>I am also a clerk in a store. This store has been open for several years. It is a department store, and most of the goods in the store are foreign goods, among which Japanese goods account for the largest number. Because Japanese goods are cheap and look very beautiful on the surface, although when used,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>they are not durable, but the psychology of our Chinese people is to only seek immediate benefits, and have no time to consider what will happen in the future. Therefore, Japanese goods sell very well, and the store owner also takes as much in as possible because it is profitable. A long time ago, we clerks wanted to ask the boss to import less foreign goods and promote domestic goods more, in order to recover our rights and interests, but we felt that this was not the boss's problem but the customer's problem. If all customers came to buy domestic goods, then foreign goods would naturally be eliminated, and the boss would naturally stop importing foreign goods. If we forced the boss not to import foreign goods, wouldn't this store have to close? So we also thought of the method of persuading customers. But three years ago, Japan's ferocious face had not yet appeared, and the Chinese people had not yet realized the terrible nature of the military and economic aggression of various countries, and because of the habit of using foreign goods and the psychology of being greedy for cheapness, although we advised them, or her, to buy domestic goods, the result was rarely effective, especially their or her attitude of despising domestic goods, which made people feel very disappointed.</p>
<p>Later, the September 18th Incident occurred, and Japan's military aggression aroused the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people, and they were a little hostile to Japanese goods, so our best opportunity to promote domestic goods came.</p>
<p>When customers just ran into the store, we clerks would talk to him about the abominableness of Japan, and the losses of China, and also talk about the benefits of buying domestic goods. If he was knowledgeable, he would definitely not buy Japanese goods or other foreign goods, and for the sake of face, he would be embarrassed to buy foreign goods again. If that customer was a truly uneducated person with no patriotism, completely didn't understand what we said, and insisted on buying Japanese goods, then we also had a way to deal with it. For example, if he wanted to buy a pair of Japanese rubber shoes, we would show them to him as usual, but always take those more worn-out goods, and say to them, Japan is not paying attention to industry and commerce because they are preparing for war, so their goods are not as good as before. At the same time, take a pair of newly arrived domestic goods and show them to him. Although they are used to seeing Japanese goods, if they see that Japanese goods are not as good as domestic goods, then they will also change to buying domestic goods. As for those who buy foreign goods, we also use the same method to deal with them, and the result is very good. It can be seen that Chinese people don't necessarily have to buy foreign goods. As long as clerks can pay attention to this point, I think the future of domestic goods will be relatively promising.</p>
<p>This kind of method of promoting domestic goods does not cause any loss to the boss, because his purpose of opening a store is just to make money. If domestic goods can sell well, he can also make money, he will definitely not be willing to promote foreign goods and be a "traitorous merchant" and be scolded by the Chinese people.

<h3>Liu Desheng in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— Wan Guoan</p>
<p>(1) The crutch is gone</p>
<p>After climbing over one mountain, there was another one right after it. Mountains were everywhere, left, right, front, and back. Liu Desheng became more and more anxious as he climbed! The rifle he was holding in his hand had simply turned into his crutch. This big black guy undoubtedly forgot his mission as a scout, and kept using all his strength to climb forward.</p>
<p>The two scouts who had set off with him on his right were now nowhere to be seen. After climbing forward for several dozen meters, he would hold onto the small trees on the hillside, open his big mouth revealing a pair of tiger teeth, and gasp for breath.</p>
<p>"Damn it! That's just messing around, where did these bandits come from, making me climb mountains like this, you could climb yourself to death and not see one." After the big black guy had almost caught his breath, he cursed like this while climbing forward again.</p>
<p>The weather in southern Jiangxi in July was already particularly hot. Although a cool breeze was blowing from the mountain tops from time to time, the scorching sun made oil pour from the forehead of this big black ant-like Liu Desheng.</p>
<p>"I'm not doing it anymore! Damn it, not doing it again!"</p>
<p>This big black guy really couldn't take it anymore! He plopped down onto the weeds, and if it wasn't for the small tree next to him blocking him, he would have almost rolled down.</p>
<p>"Moved your maternal uncle's!"</p>
<p>The big black guy's explosive temper erupted, and he reached out to throw the gun away.</p>
<p>"Little maternal uncle! If it wasn't for you being my crutch, I would have really thrown you away in this Jiangxi mountain."</p>
<p>This was the big black guy sitting on the grass, breathing heavily and slowly with his mouth, staring blankly at the clear sky with his big eyes, forgetting everything, and only caring about savoring this comfortable feeling of reality. The more he sat, the more he liked it, and his eyes gradually closed together. "Taking a nap" after great fatigue is so precious!</p>
