<h3 id="c22">產業危機之救濟 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>報載本埠各華商紗廠。因日紗侵軋。銷路呆滯。致上月底存紗又較前增加。爲切實討論救濟辦法起見。有於本月十三日召開會議之說。同時又載有本埠恒豐等絲廠。因美亞工人於請願罷工之後。曾相率罷工以爲援助。此外麵粉一業。亦傳廠商虧空月逹數百萬元之巨。由是而觀。以上海居全國商業金融之中心。其重要產業部門之基礎。竟發生如此脆弱之現象。於目前外國資本與商品重壓之下。益以日入侵迫我華北緊張之時。有牽一髮而動全身之勢。其足以危害我生產市塲。影響我東南各地之商業金融者。必至深且烈。而於國家社會尤有休戚安危之關係。故有未容忽視者焉。</p>
<p>夫禍福之至也。非至於禍福發生之日。而必有所由來。凡事皆然。而於產業危機之爆發。又安能逃此通例。蓋吾國產業之開發。造端於數十年前。絲業較紗業。尤有悠久之歷史。徒以内受封建軍閥之蹂躪。連年内戰之不息。外受帝國主義之摧殘。商品與資本之侵略。雙管齊下。一部分國人惑於國際投資之說。而終無以解外人直接經營開設公司之危機。坐是喧賓奪主。凡屬產業與金融。無不橫遭外國勢力之侵略。始終陷於不生不死之狀態。此則尤以紗廠業絲業與粉業所受之痛苦。較爲深切。由今思昔。追念何以如此脆弱趨於不克自振的地位之故。則在業中人。於此痛未定而思所以解痛之際。應如何力求自立之策。以突破今日之重重難關。此則吾人認爲有應從根本着想而無俟徘徊者也。</p>
<p>顧救危之策。非止一端。要在能窮究病源之所在。病源不治。徒致力於枝枝節節之末端。固將無補於時艱也。以今日產業現狀而論。頗有主張以削减工本或停止一部分生產機關。以疏通存貨爲救濟方案者。此就某種產業本身言。容或足以救一時之急。然就社會全般論。則大局依然無進展之可能。而彼妨礙我產業擴張之某種勢力。固方興未已。不受絲毫影響也。其次。亦有主張以金融力量從事於產業危機之救濟者。夫過去數十年中。吾國金融之不能發揮其扶助產業之任務。固無容諱。近年以來。風氣稍變。漸知注意。然已餘力無幾。致有此產業金融交受其困之勢。故居今日而欲以金融組織之力量。收發展產業之功効。倘非以大刀闊斧之計劃。從頭建樹。則其勢將惟有使產業與金融。更加重外國勢力之干涉與壓迫。故在此現狀之下而行此方策。吾人認爲不啻求病之治。而適反以速病之深也。由上以言。减工與金融二者。皆非今日產業危機救濟之根本方案。然則今日欲爲產業求根本出路。捨全國一致注意於擺脫外力與澄淸内政外。寗有他策耶。國人當亦知所本矣。</p>

<p>當然，我們這樣說，絶對没有忽視敎育，或者反對研究敎育的意思。敎育旣是社會的上層建築之一，它的發展，一方面固然决定於社會的發展，但同時也能影響甚至促進社會的發展的。我們的意思，不過想糾正一般人對於敎育不正確的觀念，而指示出現階段的敎育是怎麽一回事　。要决定研究敎育的目的，不了解敎育的本質，不明白敎育演進，要想認識新敎育的動向，是無從下手的。而且，我們也不否認在目前敎育的體系下，特權敎育的背後，是隱藏着不少的正在爲新敎育努力的堅苦耐勞的敎育者們，這正和在資本主義社會的體系内，潛伏着一種毁滅資本主義的新力量一樣。惟其這樣，所以我們才應該不爲卑俗的敎育家們所蒙蔽，應該尋找自已的前路，抛棄爲少數人所專有的敎育，而努力眞正能成爲大衆的新敎育的成長。</p>
<p>未來的新敎育，在社會進展的自然法則的推移下，必然是與資本主義以前各階段的敎育，取着相反的姿態而出現。以前的敎，是與勞　對立的，是少數人御人的工具：新敎育，便應該是歸於大衆的，應該本質上轉向與生產結合。這並不如一般現在的敎育家們，空喊着『敎育救國』那樣的誇大狂，而是在一個偉大的社會制度改革中的一種自然的產物。倘明此，研究敎育正當目的，便不難認取了。</p>
<p>旣有了正當的目的，應該怎樣開始我們研究的路程呢？</p>
<p>敎育，不僅是專從理論的探討可以解决的，同樣是一種實用的學問。這就是，　如研究物理化學，不僅要記得幾個公式，而更需要的是試騐。所以，對於這問題，我們暫分成兩方面來說。</p>
<p>關於理論的研究方面，除了敎育本身外，正如王寅君所問，在研究敎育時必須先具有何種根本知識？這誠然是研究敎育者最切要的問題。我們的回答是，研究敎育必具的根本知識，必然是社會科學知識。這理由是非常顯明的，如上面所述及敎育的演進是决定於一定的社會生產力與生產關係，那末社會生產力與生產關係，又是怎樣發展的呢？又如，精神瑩働與肉體勞働怎樣分離的呢？這些就是社會科學的問題。如果對於這些基本問題没有深切的理解，是不能希望其對於敎育會有怎樣正確的理解的。在這裏特别應注意的是哲學的知識。哲學，是人類生活的科學，是告訴人類怎樣去認議物質現象或心理現象的科學。我們常常聽到敎育家們提出敎育心理，羣衆心理的問題，但這問題，决不是如他們一樣憑自已的主觀的想像可以解答的。所以你首先應該具有正確的宇宙觀，社會觀，人生觀，和科學的觀察法，以之用到敎育去，來研究敎育，方可以獲得正確的結論，在這裹，我們可介紹一本研究初步的書，這就是李浩吾編的『新敎育大綱』（南强書店出版），這本書，是多少能給讀者對於敎育一種新的理解的。</p>
<p>再就說到實用方面。這確是一個比較難以解答的問題，敎育的廢除，新的與生產溶合的敎育之出現，必然是要等到新的社會制度上了軌道以後。在這靑黃不接的時候，同流合汚旣不可，空唱高調又等於無川。從事敎育者，究竟應該做些什麽呢？我們以爲，首先不要忘記的，我們的敎育，應該始終作爲推進社會發展的動力之一翼，應該始終作爲啓發大衆自學的引動機，站在這一立塲上，我們開始我們的敎育工作。我們　以當敎師，無論在中小學校，無論在工廠農村的補習學校，但我们决之單是爲了生活，不單是彈高調，我們應該去了解大衆學生，應該去從大衆學生的實生活中尋出他們苦悶的源泉，提起他們讀書的生活興趣，舉例來說，現在一般庸俗的敎育家們，是在壓迫學生智力的發展，而我們却是要增進學生智力的發展，盡可能地灌輸他們以新的知識的食糧。</p>
<p>我們的話便在此終止了，這當然是十分的不够，但，如果讀者能够把這理解得很清楚，作爲研究敎育的出發點，自然也不是完全無裨益的罷！（完）</p>

<p>— 清德齡公主原著秦瘦鵑譯</p>
<p>然而伊其實的確是老了；那時候，伊的年齡已快近七十歲了。伊的面部，伊的手指，也和尋常的老年的女人一樣地顯露着老的象徵了；可是倘有人直言無諱的說伊是老了，伊就不免要非常着惱，認爲是重大的侮辱。</p>
<p>『···再者，他們也不該說』，伊繼續的自語着，伊的怒火是逐漸的升高了『因爲這裹有些事情要辦，我們就不能離開北京！難道說他们竟不知道我們的人走到那裹’整個的朝迁，便跟隨到那裹，所有的事情，不是依舊可以辦嗎？像庚子那年拳亂的時候，我們望西安一走，洋兵便跟不上來了；而我們的朝廷，却是依舊在我們的手裹！伊们竟連這些都不明白嗎？這樣愚蠢的東西，要他們幹什麽』！</p>
<p>于是，太后東報的事情，便這樣决定了。就有欽天監替我們揀了一個大吉大利的日期和時辰，以便出發。這一天，禁城裹是充滿了一種狂熱的忙亂的空氣，從李蓮英起，一直到最低級的宮女；從執政的大臣起，一　到鐵路上最小的差役：從皇太后和宮眷起，一直到我們这些侍從女官：個個都是一樣的忙亂。</p>
<p>當然，從朝門一直到火車站去的一條大路上，又得照例的舖上一層黃沙；這些黃沙都是浸得很濕的，像海邊的沙灘一樣，爲的是免給風括起來。一出紫金城的大門，我們便一齊上了轎：我的轎子恰好緊隨着太后的鸞輿。我們穿過了中華門，前門，沿着前門大街，一直到永定門；那裹，就是我們上車的所在。（一一）</p>

<p>我每次走過同濟路時，在路帝一塊田裹；總看見那所長方形的石灰糊的白墳；上面有着半大四個黑字：『野村之墓』，旁邊幾個小字：『××師宣傳組』。看到後，眼前也立刻浮現了前年二月的戰爭殘影：鼻中似乎還充滿着血腥。心裹呢？彷彿受着極大恥辱似的。</p>
<p>然而，那四字一天天的淡了，終於在這連綿幾天的春雨裹完全消失了。今天再經過這路時，白境，已是一所純白色的墳了。帝邊長滿着蓬的靑草，黃金色的小花。清香陣陣的放射出來，眞沁人心脾，使人起了『初春的美』的感覺。</p>
<p>血腥，誰還覺得呢？血肉相搏······誰再去想像它呢？什麽是恥辱？一切都被時間帶跑了；春雨洗凈了。享受羆！朋友，這『春之美』！</p>

<p>磁器之精，首推遜清康乾時代，迨及後世，惟洪憲稱帝時，刻意求精，不亞古月軒之古磁，研究古磁者，類能知之。平湖葛君祖芬，善書畫，富收藏，搜求磁器尤夥，去夏養疴匡廬，遇南陵畫磁名家何許人君，見其所繪磁屏山水，工細絶倫，雪景尤佳妙入神，超越北宋畫院之粉本，空前絶後，嘆爲觀止，當代名公，咸以乞得一器爲榮幸。葛與何相交月餘，常與暢論古磁，獲益非淺，舉凡古名磁之可供參攷者，悉羅致之。何言繪磁之難，遠非紙絹可比，彩色加釉，濃厚粗　，較膠漆而過之，鈎勒尙可，　染更難；且磁器開框之處，祇有數寸，畫山水而欲求其邱　林泉俱備，非粟人豆馬不爲功，甚矣畫磁之難也！何有嵇康之癖，不肯輕易落筆，每繪一器，閱數月始成，市上之許人作品，大半出其門下所繪，許人偶爲之潤色而已。且聞許人倜儻瀟洒，重友誼，有長者風，烟霞嘯傲，不求聞逹於諸侯，洵難能而可貴者也。</p>

<p>澄泥硯槪况</p>
<p>㈢古磚亦爲澄泥一種上所述乃係眞澄泥硯，尙有一種古磚，亦名澄泥硯，唐桐園說澄泥硯云，『江南之通州寳山，亦名有澄泥硯，此皆海濱之大川沙小川沙黃窑等處土人，於海灘泥沙中挖得磚塊爲之，或謂春申君黃歇，開窑陶造澄泥於此，故名黃窑，然戰國至今幾三千年，卽有此事，其殘磚斷塊，亦奚能留至於今，意必因明洪武時之黃窑纏誤耳。洪武初年，曾築寳山吳淞二所碍城，於黃窑開陶，卽取海灘近水澄細堅泥作磚，當時殘缺斷廢者，傾棄海灘，及寳山所城没海中，頽墻壞堞，爲波濤流沙，蕩停海塘，在海中年久，火性消盡，土人得之以爲硯，固嘗有之，然佳者絶少，乃商宦士紳，不加細察，聞通州產澄泥硯，輒來購買，每年三月中，狼山香信，山下趕集，市肆紛陳，俱號澄泥硯以欺人，過客不辦眞　，每以重價貨之，實皆攛取蘇州靈巖山　村石或搜羅海邊較古較細之磚以僞爲之也。』由此可以證明通州寳山之古城磚，在乾嘉時亦當做澄泥硯的，不但通州寳山之古城磚當做澄泥，凡古代莫可考究之磚硯，亦都稱爲澄泥硯。</p>
<p>余藏一放鴨翁（宋犖）遺硯，邵長蘅題爲宋坑玫瑰五色澂泥硯，其跋語云，『是硯後人論者，皆以爲宋坑澂泥，因髯翁首先作硯，知爲席珍，實乃秦漢故磚，宋時出土爾。』而放鴨翁自題則云，『東坡居士論澂泥硯分五色，秦漢以上皆紅色，爲上品，他皆不若，余得此足比琚璇矣。』</p>
<p>余又藏一妻梅仙館硯，亦稱爲玫瑰紫澄泥硯，但側面有迂道人題云，『昆明刦灰燒不死，出水猶作電光紫，陰陽爐炭施化工，摶埴不知何年始，咸陽一炬火德興，漢家宮殿無遺址，迄今寸土猶足珍，千載茫茫弔靑史，呈嗟乎地下古人呼不起，陳迹問之管城子，』是明明說秦漢古磚也。</p>
<p>此可見澄泥與古磚，在前人亦尙分别不清，何怪今日之市估，隨意亂道。春實澄泥與古磚，苟稍加研究，亦易分别，澄泥之製造，制别細潤，卽以色論其玫瑰紫之紅色，究與經火刦之紅色不同，且澄泥之佳者，每有靑黃等色相間，又有豆瓣砂。菉豆砂·暈月華·針頭銀星等種種文彩發現，而古磚則無此一類也。</p>

<p>— 象離</p>
<p>近來好像有許多作家在討論着怎樣作文。或說要採用語錄，或說要走到街頭。其實這皆可算勞叨，可有可無的。</p>
<p>重要的在乎思想，卽文章的内容。爲文章而寫文章，大可不必。當然，有話要說，頗求說出怎樣能感動聽者，應有相當的技能。伯訥，蕭之寫文章，一望汪洋，浩瀚無際，而自謂爲藝術而藝術，不足以移其筆端一分一毫，其所以發爲佳文，却是苦的藥上所加的一層糖衣，使服者易於下咽。</p>
<p>没有内容的文章，卽使是作的非常美麗，于談者則毫無效用，浮光掠影，也决不能感人。而且，也决不容易作。　如說話總是發表着自已的意見的，而求說話毫無自已的意見，這是多麽困難呢？</p>
<p>文勝質則野，質勝文則鄙。所求者能『質文無過』。普通爲文的練習，也並非爲文章而文意，却是好像練習說話，至于有話要說時，便於說，易於說。『爲文』的目的，至多不過這樣。丨及至滔滔不絶，這時如光，如電，如長江大河，陽與剛之美，陰與柔之美···全憑聽者去附會的。</p>
<p>但很少見文章能有實質。五四運動以來，頗不乏能寫文章的，但多文無實質，結果流於空疎。吟風弄月也要有自已的人格，思想，風月方能有情。說靑年面色必『蒼白』，講天空顏色必『蔚藍』，或者『心弦顫動』，或者『拳頭揑緊』，丨皆是落了『爲文』的舊套的。</p>
<p>眼前的人物，看去好像毫不費力而寫作的，寥寥，寥寥中又能說得上有内容的，更少。使槍弄棒的人甚多，但毫無絶技，只落得在江湖上流浪，大分其『京派』『海派』，尋些小生活。眞使人『忽反顧以流涕兮，哀高丘之無女也丨』可惜者，七八年來有許多能作文章的靑年，或則自暴知棄，變成了鬼怪：或則因了特别原因而消亡，現時皆默默。這是環境的罪過而又必需特派到『學者』，『士大夫』，以及『正人君子』之流的頭上去的。</p>

<p>入山行一二里，地勢漸高。山徑曲折，係沿着兩峯之間的一條溪泉而上。一邊是清溪，一邊是絶壁。壁巖峻處，半山間有玲瓏仙境的四大字刻在那裹。再上是東坡的醉眠石，九折巖。三休亭的遺址，大約也在這牛山之中。壁上的摩崖石刻，在計其數。可惜這山都是沙石岩，風化得厲害，石刻的大半，都已經辦認不清了。最妙的是蘇東坡的那塊醉眠石，在山溪的西旁，石壁下的路東，長長的一塊方石，橫躺下去，也儘可以容得一人的身長，眞像是一張石做的沙發。東坡的究竟有没有在此石上醉眠過，且不去管牠，但石上的三字，與離此石不遠的岩壁上的九折岩三字，以及『何年僵立兩蒼龍』的那一首律詩，相傳都是東坡的乎筆；我非考古金石家，私自想想這些古蹟還是貎虎認牠作眞的好，假冒風雅比之燒琴煮鶴，究竟要有趣一點。還有醉眠石的東首，也有一塊岩石，橫立溪旁，上鑑琴聲兩篆字，想係因流水淙淙有琴韵，與琴操墓就在上面的雙關佳作，因爲不忍埋没這作者的苦心，故而在此提起一句。</p>
<p>沿溪摸壁，再上五六十步，過合澗泉，至山頂下平坦處，有一路南繞出西面一支峯下。順道南去，到一處突出平坦之區，大約是收眷亭的舊址。坐此處而南望，遠近的山峯田野，蓋在指顧之間，平地一方，可容三四百人。平地北面，當山峯削落處，還留剩一石　，下覆古石刻像三尊，相傳爲東坡佛印山谷三人遺像，明褚棟所說的因夢得像，因像建碑的處所，大約也就在這襄，而明黃鼎象所記的剩借亭的遺址，總也是在這一塊地方了，俗以此地爲三休亭，更訛爲三賢祠，皆係誤會者無疑。</p>
<p>在石　下眺望了半天，仍遵原路向北向東，過一處菜地裹的碑亭，就到玲瓏山寺裹去休息。小坐一會，喝了一碗茶，更隨老僧出至東面峯頭，過鐘樓後，便到了琴操的墓下。一杯荒土，一塊粗碑，上面只刻着琴操墓的三個大字。繙閱新舊臨安縣志，都不見琴操的事蹟，但云墓在寺東而已，只有馮萝禎的琴操墓詩一首：</p>
<p>絃索無聲濕露華，白雲深處冷袈裟，三泉金骨知何地，一夜西風掃落花。抄在這裹，聊以遮遮臨安縣志編者之羞。</p>
<p>同遊者潘光旦氏，是馮小靑的研求者，林語堂氏是桃花扇裹的李香君的熱愛狂者，大家到了琴操墓下，就齊動公憤，說臨安縣志編者的毫無見識。語堂且更揑了一本野叟曝言，慷慨陳詞地說：</p>
<p>『光旦，你去修馮小靑的墓罷，我立意要去修李香君的墳，這琴操的墓，只好讓你們來修了。』</p>
<p>說到後來，眼睛就釘住了我們，所謂你們者，是在指我們的意思。因這一段廢話，我倒又寫下了四句狗屁。</p>
<p>山旣玲瓏水亦清，東坡曾此訪雲英，如何八劵臨安志，不記琴操一段情。</p>

<p>烈文兄：</p>
<p>埜容君嘆人間何世，我却正在嘆世間何人？世間上若只有埜容其人者，則亦只有大品文章，處盛世則揖讓王廷，歌頌聖德，處亂世亦只有慷慨激昻，長吁短嘆，更必有善器民族，或相對潛然，或放聲大器，或發起跪哭團，要求欠薪，或組織破壞團，向弱小女子示威，此輩人與我老死不相往來可也。然此輩人，古已有之，不足深怪。論語早已受這般人之鄙夷，而人間世亦必遭此等人之白眼，數中事也。蓋禁容君雖寫來却是白話，其深惡小品文之方巾氣與前反對白話維持道統之文人無别。埜容君是看重『宇宙』，鄙視『蒼蠅』，我却鄙夷宇宙，好談蒼蠅。若問蒼蠅有何可談，請閱人問世第一期『金聖嘆極微篇』。此篇文字看不懂之人，必加蒼蠅以白眼，世間上此種人，正復不少，所以禁容君之文曰『現在却只看見幾隻蒼蠅』，一若寥寥數語，便足貶却人間世之價值，然吾知蒼蠅却不會因埜容其人之白睨而遂不入小品，小品文亦不因埜容其人之白眼而减其魔力，埜容君拭目以俊之可也。埜容君好談的是世道，是人心，然世道人心若不從微處入手談起。亦每每談得昏頭昏腦，不知所云，讀下去頗有抑揚頓挫，顯微鏡一照却令人噴飯。吾兄不信，有下文爲證。埜容論周作人雖善作小品，却未能寫小說，魯迅寫成小說佳作之前亦未寫雜感小品，冀以證明吾說『創作小說佳作由小品文訓練而來』之謬。接着是一段新八股：</p>
<p>『倘說，那是另有原因，那就是代小品文誇張盜名，倘說是確有其事，那就是發刋者違心欺世』</p>
<p>兩個『倘』字用來雖頗有勁，然兩種假設究係相成或相反關係，恐作者亦不甚了了，要在借此可以用『違心欺世』與『誇張盜名』做對仗罷了。可見人若不從小處微處着手，世道人心亦常會談不通的。</p>
<p>埜容君謂『個人的玩物喪志，輕描淡寫，這就是小品文』。甚足代表新道學之見解思想。這與以前提倡『雜文』現在接二連三反對『小品文』之一般文人見解不相上下吧？</p>

<p>實情眞也難以呌人做平常看。那老女人穿的是一身破布塊，下打下掛的，臉上很憔悴，口不住的嚼食物往兩隻狗口裹送，一邊還不住咕念着，這咕念像是一種安慰。那兩條狗，一白一黑，毛色很潤澤，每個的頸上都繫一條紅帶，把頭朝她仰着，不住的搖動尾巴，口裹也哼着一種聲，像是愛。最後這老人走了，它倆一邊一個隨着她。</p>
<p>我常想，人生没有别的，就是『迷』，『迷』就是生的生量！你所『迷』的東西在别人看來或者覺得一點也不值得，那在你頂好不要管這些。到了『舉世非之而不加勸』的程度，才算眞『迷』。『迷』得到了家也許就是『偉大』。『迷』就是『思想單一』彷彿記Ｍasx說他成功的惟一道路，就是『思想單一』。</p>

<p>但還有一件事以不同的感覺使我常常記起來的，是他底一篇講演，呌做『過去的幽靈』的。内容由當時站在新文學運動的前面的周作人先生翻了出來，說是在你們（當時的中國靑年們）裹面還住着不少的『過去的幽靈』，時時會跑了出來，鼓動你們照他們底意思做事。這很簡單，但由他那一種詩人的說法說了出來簡直是活靈活現，抓住了我們，使我們甚至在路上走的時候有時都會愓然回顧。他爲什麽作了一篇這樣的使幼少的我們感到有些陰森的講演呢，那來由當然不能够確切地知道，但現在回想起來，總不外是雖然他瞎了眼晴，看不見，但這個古國幾千年來所壓積下來的黑暗的力，以一種陰沉沉的氣息壓着了他，使他感到了快要窒息，因而不得不向臉上略略現着新的紅潤的靑年們呌喊了吧。</p>
<p>時光流了過去，現在的戰鬥的靑年已經在純眞上鍊出了鋼强和靈敏了，愛羅先珂已漸漸地被忘去。這是應該的。</p>
<p>然而，今天我在書攤上面買到了一本創刋的『人間世』。還没有拜讀『宇宙之大，蒼蠅之微』的『可喜文章』之前，就被前面的周作人先生底大照片和他底五十自壽詩吸引住了。周先生在『五·四』文學運動上，在介紹外國文學上，有了不小的努力，當他五十歲的時候我們也許還願看一看他底照片的，但使我啞然的是那兩首詩（那些和詩更不用說了）。如果是在『四庫全書』的什麽集子裹面發現的，對於這樣『爐火純靑』的七律，當然要拍案呌絶。然而，這個作者却就是當年爲詩底解放而鬥爭過了的『小河』底作者，現在在這裹『談狐說鬼』『街頭終日聽談鬼』的作者，當年却熱心地爲我們翻譯了『過去的幽靈』。（未完）</p>

<p>— 王越</p>
<p>但生活是不肯放鬆一個人的。而且生活本身就是一種强力和智慧。彷彿岩石下的小草一樣，生命的小草，在現社會的岩石下，也頑固而玲琍地找出她的生路來了。她帶着瘡，開始在這都市里巡行。搖着小洋鐵筒，發出悲聲乞討。在洋鬼子的面前舉手行禮，說着洋涇浜的外國話。向包飯作的小二籠絡飯食。她曾經一次混入難民衆中，誑稱她是災區的逃亡者，投進救濟所去。但那里有的是打駡和不自由，并無救濟。或者就因爲這個，她不久才又犯人逃獄似的跑掉了。</p>
<p>跟着來的，依舊是毫無根據的流浪，在街頭和電車站間乞討，給做說明我們現有文明的本質的材料。從大街移到這偏僻的住宅區域，乃是這以後的事了。在這里寄居的，是公司里的跑街和小工，失業的職員和理髮師。生活是寒儉而單調，只在禮拜日和黃昏的時候才有一點生氣。人們喝老酒，在衖道上擺了方桌搓麻將，挪挪胡琴。雇用下人在他們的生活里是一種放肆的幻想，他們甚至没有一個看守衖堂的小工。但是没有貨價的勞力，或者貨價低賤的勞力，總是很少有人拒絶的。</p>
<p>算作工錢，他們僅慬給一點剩餘的冷飯，和已經變了味的菜食。在她呢，這却已經十分滿足了。因爲那不比乞討來的更適合一個人的胃口，由於多少人家固定的底供給，挨餓的事，總算是没有了。而且她不時還會有餘的東西，來給她滿足那對於别的困苦的人們的同情，或者存留起來，在寂寞得發悶的時候，像人們吃點心似的，取來打發她無聊的感觸。因爲所有的工作都集中在是中和早晨，而衖堂又並不寛大，這樣無聊的時間是常有的。但更多的時讓，她不是嬾嬾地掃着并不需要再掃的衖道，便是拖着竹掃帚，在水門汀上來回地彳亍着，讓破爛的男人皮鞋，打秦出寂的調子。</p>

<p>昨晚全國籃球預選之第二戰、上海以最美妙清晣之傳遞、以三十三比二十一擊敗南京、滬隊五虎、均能維持原狀、盡顯各人所長、勇則勇矣、而火氣毫無、全隊打成、片、使頑强之南京隊、不得不甘拜下風矣、觀乎昨晚滬隊之表演、前晚對湖北、何悉不克、大意先風、實屬可惜、今晚湖北對南京交鋒、大致湖北可操勝劵、</p>

<p>北之戰、獨獲二十分、昨晚被對乎特别注意、上半時竟無紀錄、而錢敬鏞恢復舊時鋒芒、累累得分、馮念華孫實鑒克盡厥職、陸鍾恩經騐豐富、</p>

<p>常緊張、比數忽前忽後、難解難分、滬隊最多僅勝五分、上半時終了、祇勝十三比十一、相差兩分耳、下半時陸鍾恩向前助戰、陳祥龍如猛虎出柙、各有建樹、於是南京陣容荒亂、振作不起、比數相差最大爲二十九比二十七、京隊困於嚴守、無機可圖、聯絡方面、遽不若滬隊、</p>

<p>滬隊頻頻犯規、南京遂以罰球先開紀錄、爭持良久、錢敬鏞投中罰中、三比二導前、孫寳慶相繼建功、錢敬鏞再加二分、七比二、南京屈居下風、力圖振刷張長清劉夢九、追上三分、滬隊賴錢之努力、旋成九比四、南京徐圖宏展、奮發有爲、打成九比九、而十一比十一、雙方均拙於遠射、亦因光綫燿眼、雙方撲鬥甚烈、陸鍾恩之一球、造成十三比十一之勝績、</p>

<p>— 翁之龍</p>
<p>癆病對於國家及社會方面有密切的開係，這一種病又呌做『貧民病』，大凡社會經濟狀况愈窮，那麽，窮人就愈多，窮人愈多，癆病也就多起來了，何以呢？因爲經濟不良的緣故，必定是飲食不良，起居不良，心境不良，癆病就容易發生，貧窮的人們得了病，無錢醫治，因此愈窮愈病，不可救藥，這是因窮而病的。反過來說，癆病一多，社會的經濟必定更窮，因爲患癆病的人多了，他們不能去工作，必至失業，國家多一個失業的，就是多一個分利的，少一個生利的，在這種情况之下，國家和社會的經濟，怎得不大受損失呢？因此愈病愈窮，這是因病而窮的。由是而言，愈窮愈病，愈病愈窮，這樣循境不已，人民多病，國勢因之不振，是容易自已滅亡的！所以要救國，要醫病國，非先醫病的人民不可，諸位要知道，人民要是健康，生產力自然會强大的，生產力大，國家和社會的經濟狀况自然就可以好起來了，所謂『民富就是社會國家的富』，這是相因而至的，那麽由此看來，癆病與社會經濟的關係，是非常的深切的再談到我們國内的人民，歷年因癆病死亡的何止午萬，人民和國家的損失何止幾百萬萬元。因爲没有詳細的統計，不能反一種正確的百分比例報告出來，這是很可惜的，這也是很可憂慮的一件大事，我們總碍要設法來補救他。</p>
<p>據我所知道的，德國柏林市自一零六年的五年以内，因爲人民患癆病死亡而受的損失，每年大約計算起來在百三十三兆馬克，再加上一種因死亡而生產力的揖失費，約計在一百五十兆馬克，總共損失在三百八十兆馬克，由此就可以知道他們國家在一個城市内因病所受損失已經有這樣的浩六了的但是根據Ｍoller氏的計算，近年來因爲預防得法，癆病减少，國家的損失已經减到百餘兆馬克了，由此就可以知道提倡預防癆病，就是替民衆保護生命和財產，也就是爲國家生財，爲國家保持元氣，我們中國人癆病死亡率比國國更大，推想起來就可以知道中國的財產損失大了，防癆工作當然是格外的重要。</p>
<p>癆病就是結核病，起病的原因多是由傳染結楄細菌而起的，因爲社會經濟不良，一切預防上不甚注意，受了傳染，這種病　醫學上講，對於子孫雖然没有遺傳性，但癆病人的子孫身體總是不大好，容易傳染或得到其他的疾病，這是抵抗力不强的原故！</p>
<p>例如Ｗeiu　berg氏的報告自一八七三年在德國Stuttgart城對於嬰兒三十年中的死亡統計</p>
<p>每百嬰兒父有癆病的嬰兒死亡佔四六八二</p>
<p>每百嬰兒母有癆病的嬰兒死亡佔四八一一</p>
<p>每百嬰兒父没有癆病的嬰兒死亡佔四○二七</p>
<p>每百嬰兒母没有癆病的嬰兒死亡佔中四○·一七</p>
<p>由此主可以知道有癆病的子孫比較的是身體不甚强健。</p>
<h3 id="c241">皮膚病常識（上） <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>今天承福音無綫電臺王完白醫師的囑託。呌鄙人來講醫藥衛生。鄙人對於醫學。自問没有深切的研究。有可以貢獻給諸位的地方。現在只好從鄙人所學的皮膚病方面。把很淺近的常議。來貢獻給諸位吧。</p>
<p>吾們要講皮膚病常議之先。必定先一種很重要的器官。究竟他在解剖上和生理上。　什麽特點。可以負這樣重大的責任程。吾現在先把皮膚的解剖大略解說一下。</p>
<p>皮膚在普通的人看起來。雖則是很薄的一層。但是醫師用器械切下一片。再用顯微鏡檢　起來。可以把他分做三層。第一層呌做表皮。第二層呌做眞皮。第二層呌做皮下組織。表皮大約還可以分做二層。上層呌做角層。下層呌做種子層，角層是吾們皮膚上帶黃色或是白色有透明性的一層。也是表皮的最外界。種子層裹面含有多少的色素。世界人種顏色的差别。就在這一層色素量濃淡的關係。還有他和眞皮相接觸的地方。有淋色夜。和眞皮的淋巴液相交通。所以發炎的時候。眞皮中的淋巴細胞。可以逹到表皮裹來。第二層呌做眞皮。眞皮含有結　　細胞。結　　東節細胞。並且混有彈力繼維。所以眞皮的彈力是很大的。此外還有血管。淋巴管。淋巴腔。神經。神經終末器。脂腺。汗　。毛髮等。實在是皮膚主要的部分。第三層呌做皮下組織。也呌皮下脂肪組　。這是隨着男女，老幼，人種，個人的健康狀態。或厚或薄。是没有一定的。</p>
<p>上面把皮膚的解剖。大約已經　過了。現在來講皮膚的生理作用。講　皮膚的生理作用。是很多很多。譬如　經作用，分泌，吸收，呼吸，體温調節，保護各種外害等。現在把他分開來　。</p>
<p>第一。先講神經作用。皮膚的知覺神經。可以分做四種。就是觸覺，置覺，冷覺，痛覺。一種的知覺。有一　專屬的神經終末器來官。皮膚利用這種的神經作用。可以知道外界種種的情形。可以預防災害。譬如利用温覺神經。可以知道火的熱。利用冷覺神經。可以知道冰的冷。利用痛覺神經。可以知道刀劍外害的侵襲。利用觸覺神經。可以知道所接觸的是何物。但是這樣四種神經終末器的分佈。並不一定。隨着部位的不同。是有多少的。譬如指尖。他的觸覺和痛覺的終末器比較的多。所以觸覺和痛覺。也比較的最靈敏。倘使皮膚没有這樣神經作用。就可以發生很大的危險。譬如遇着火而不覺熱。就可以發生火傷。</p>
<p>第二。講皮膚的分泌作用。皮膚有汗腺和皮脂腺。汗腺能够分泌汗液。皮脂腺能够分泌脂肪。把皮膚滑澤。倘使分泌過多或是不足。那就變成種種的疾病。譬如皮脂漏，皮脂缺乏，面頗等等。發汗的主要作用。就是從身體排泄多量的水分。來代替腎臟的官能。並且因爲水分蒸發的關係。可以减少皮膚和血液的温度。使體温降低。夏季多出汗。就是利用汗水的蒸發。奪去身體的温度。實在也是一種很重要的體温調節法。</p>
<p>第三，是體温調節作用，從身體發散的温度。有百分之八十是從皮膚上放散的。就是利用他血管的收縮和擴張。譬如冷天的時候。皮膚血管收縮。温度的放散减少。所以冷天時候的皮膚多呈倉白色。（凍傷的紅腫不在此例）熱天的時候。皮膚血管擴張。温度的放散增加。所以熱天的皮膚多紅潤。豈不是一件很巧妙的裝置嗎。而且皮膚利用他表皮外層的角層。能够抵抗外界高度的温熱。你看夏季火樣熱的地上。車夫不是赤着脚去跑嗎。他一方面還能够防禦温度過度的放散。有一種受廣大火傷的病人。皮膚剝脫。病人因温度過度的放散。易陷於衰弱。</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>今之言國是者，動以無人材爲歎，豈眞無人材哉？有人材而弗知用也。楚不用苗賁是而奔晋，虞不用百里奚而入秦：中國有人材而他國用之，古之於今，一丘之貉，至是慨也。劉永純博士，留法八年，治細菌學，於巴黎巴斯，德學院，曾一度返華，終以懷才不遇而再涉異國，爲西貢巴斯德學院所聘，主管ＢＣＧ菌苗製造事務，氏專心學業，極意研求，饒有所得，卓然專家，而國人猶未之知也。今者氏以歸省慈　暫時返國，傾談之際，欽佩益深，余之與氏，誼則　親，又兼同學，平生景仰，端在斯人，若云人材，宜當首選，茲者癆病之預防，甚　塵上，而ＢＣＧ之製造，實之專家，用本舉不避親之義，以介紹於國人之前。母使有用之材，淪於異域云爾。</p>

<p>人類的生命的維持，是靠着兩性的繁殖，結婚便是逹到繁殖的途徑：所以結婚不但是個人問題，而且是人類發展上重要的工作。如果我們不研究結婚的一切，盲目地結婚，結果必影響到人類發展的將來。許多學者，認定結婚爲人的應盡義務，也是用人類的目光來立論。</p>
<p>被壓迫在宗法社會底下的中國人民，中了虚僞的舊禮敎的流毒，對於兩性的結婚，注重那『雙親治命，六禮相將，』等等不切實際的手續。至於兩性發育的情形和結婚年齡的適當或否，絶未顧慮到。兩性的父母，受過敎育的少，没有智識的多。他們受了『男大須婚，女大須嫁』的古訓，和傳宗接代的中世紀的觀念支配，要嘗那含飴弄孫的樂趣，迅速地將兒女婚嫁事辦畢，以了一生的願望。因之，有些人因結婚而得到幸福，有些人因結婚反而步入悲觀的途徑。</p>
<p>人類到了十四歲，然也有早至十二歲，遲至十七歲的，身體上發生了特異的變化。這種變化，便是兩性成熱的象徵，醫學上稱他曰春機發動期。男性到了這時期，聲音要變粗濁，容貎趨向美化，骨肉較前堅實强壯，張成美麗飽滿的身體，唇上腋下等部位都生起毛來，尤其是生殖器發生了顯著的變化。人類繁殖的種子丨精液。便在這時開始分泌。女性到了這時期，身體上發生的變化，比男性尤爲顯著：肌肉肥嫩，皮膚光潔，充分地現着女性靑春之美。乳房和生殖器的一切，都異常發逹。同時開始月經的排泄。在春機發動期的兩性，不但肉體上發生變化，精神方面，也有特徵的變化。尤其知道性的需要，對於從前模糊的兩性的區别，這時已有了明確的認識。</p>
<p>性的需要，旣在查機發動期開始。因之春機發動期的早遲，與結婚的年齡有狠大的相關。所以世界各國人民結婚的年齡，都根據春機發動期的早遲而定。大槪温帶的人，春機發動期較早，早婚的多。寒帶的人，發動期遲，早婚的少。醫學最發逹的德國，民法規定男性結婚年齡須要在二十五歲以上，女性在二十一歲以上，也是根據春機發動期而定。至於女性結婚比男性早，這是因爲女性性的喪失比男性早的緣故。</p>
<p>有許多人主張春機發動期之初，便舉行結婚，他的理由：</p>
<p>㈠性慾是人類的本能，與食慾有同等的重要，在知道需要性的時候結婚，實際上不發生何等害處。</p>
<p>㈡早婚可以免除有害的手淫遺精，結果成爲性的更健全者。</p>
<p>㈢早婚可以防止不道德的行爲，免却花柳病傳染的危險。</p>
<p>這些，確有相當的理由，不能絶對的否認。但我們應當知道春機發動期性的發逹，雖已完全，可是身體别部份的發育，還在繼續的進行。如果僅根據性的完全，不顧到别的情形，一定得到下列的結果。</p>
<p>㈠影響到身體的健全和發育。</p>
<p>㈡未成年的男女，意志薄弱，不能節制性慾的過度。</p>
<p>㈢所生的子女，因先天的不足，體格都不健全，影響於種族的將來。</p>
<p>㈣年齡太稚，學識未充，不能爲子女的模範。</p>
<p>而且照生物學上說：兩性的結婚，應當在春機發動期之後。如果未逹充分的年齡而結婚，不免要陷於虚弱衰亡。不但是這樣，卽使從社會上，經濟上，智識上觀察，結婚過早的，决没有良好的结果。我們固然反對早婚，然而也不贊成結婚過遲，因爲各有相等的害處。我們主張在適當年齡，應行結婚，最好男性自二十五　至三十歲，女性比男性早四五年。　於手淫花柳病，確是有害於身體的不良的行爲，但可以利用性慾敎育來救濟。在舊禮敎底下生長的父母，以爲性慾是一種汚穢卑鄙的行爲，這是錯譌的觀念。美國維廉魯演遜氏主張兒童到了十歲至十三歲，應當敎以簡單的生殖器的解剖和生理：在十三歲至十六歲，可給他說明花柳病的危險和手淫的有害。至於一切有誘致性的本能傾向的東西丨淫書，淫畫，淫戲，尤嚴禁與兒童接觸。同時設法引起兒童對於研究學問的興趣，使他的構成性慾精力的要素，消費在研究途上。使性的本能，得到自然的節制和融化，這確是一個良好的辦法。可惜我國敎育未能普及，而且頑固的父母多，有誰能打破虚僞的禮敎，注意到性的敎育呢？</p>
<h3 id="c244">肺結核淺說（一） <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>導言</p>
<p>結核這一個病症，在我國從前的社會已經非常重視了！普通民間有一句最流行的俗話，呌做：『癱癆鼓膈，是四個不治的重症，』這名話當然是古代品耳相傳，含有不少事實上的眞義在裹面的。但是我們要曉得，風癱，鼓脹，膈氣，這三者祇是每一病症中重要症象之一，並不是一個病症，這類症象在每一病症中，發生的例子是很多的。惟有『癆』字和其他不同，歸根到底，完全係代表我們所說的結核一病的。狹義的，也可以說一名，這就是本題目的肺癆（結核）一症了。返過來看一看，現代的醫學界是如何的眼光呢？他們都共同認定，結核，梅毒，癌腫，三者是全世界的三大病症，這種見解，係完全根據事實而立論的，當然比前者高明多了。關於癌腫一症，一直到現在，他的原因和治療，還没有具體辦法；現在且捨開不談。梅毒就不同了，他的原因，固然已完全明瞭；治療方面，也是有特効藥的。但我們如從傳染途徑上去觀察，梅毒傳染之免除，並不是完全没有可能的。他大半的原因，是由和不潔之異性性交而發生的，遺傳上的例證也是很多的，那末，如果没有這二種事實，他的傳梁的危險性，無論如何，總比較好一點。結核就完全不同了！他的唯一傳染途徑，吸入傳染的實在情形，是令人防不勝防的。我們要曉得，每一個人的需要空氣，是比較並通的『食，色，性也；』還要重要；換名話說，就是離開呼吸空氣，是不能生存的。那末，我們也可以說，無人不怕傳染結核病的了。另外一方面，我們從未來上揣測，現代的物質文明，是日進無已的，像人烟稠密的工業區域，車馬輻輳的大都市，當然是一天比一天多的。但這樣的發逹，是和結核症的蔓延，很有利益的。換一句話，我們也不媥可以說：結核症將來的蔓延傳播，也是日進無已的。像這樣的情形，梅毒當然是微有不同的，因爲他係有特効藥做後盾的，再則工業發逹，和他也没有直接關係，所以我們如果拿結核梅毒二症並論，同爲人類的大敵，『一時瑜亮』，是没有問題的；但語其『無孔不入』和『日進無已』的傳佈情形，那末，老大哥的第一把椅子，恐怕還是要讓給結核病坐的。</p>
<p>結核症之爲人類大敵，和他易於傳佈的情形，上面大槪已經說過一點了。那末，患此病者，有没有一個統計呢？這在我們的中國，是文獻無徵的。歐洲的學者回答是：患本病而死的，係占人類全體死亡數七分之一，但在繁盛都市或工業區域，是不止此數的。這一種驚人的數目，是比任何病症都多。在德國從前的報告，每年死於本病的，不下十萬人。其中幾乎百分之九十，患的是肺結核症。另外在一萬人口上計算，在德國係平均百分之十七光景，在瑞士和法國是百分之二十一數目。復次，在年齡上觀察，也是每一個時期都會發生的。二三十歲的壯年，固不用說了；在一二歲的小孩，已有患本病死亡的事實；在五六十歲的老年人，死亡數尤多。此一種事實，很可以證明一我國四十歲以上卽不患結核的俗說。』是误謬的。我們隨便拿一個上面的死亡數目計算，都是非常驚入的。無怪乎德國大病理學家Ａscboff氏，要發『無人不癆』，石破天驚的大　　了</p>

<p>北平中法大學敎援朱·家·健·述意</p>
<p>今日世界各國之醫士。皆知用血清洽療之法。其效神速。且能治療他藥所不能治療之危症。例如白喉一病。在血清未發明以前。得之者往往有性命之憂。今用血清救治。則無恙矣。須知血清治療之法。今雖已普遍全球。活人無算。然其發明之年月距今不遠。實爲現代醫界之偉績。而其發明人法國之魯愛彌大醫士。逝世距今。亦不過三閱月耳。法國政府以國喪禮葬之。豈無故哉。今謂略述魯醫士之人物及其學業如次。</p>
<h3 id="c246">（一）魯愛彌醫士之爲人及　其模範生活 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>魯醫士係以一八五三年十二朋十七日生於法國之恭佛朗城。其父爲當地之中學校校長。早卒。遺兒女九人。二子死於普法之役。魯醫士自中學畢業後卽入格萊孟費郎大學之醫科肄業。嗣以舊日化學敎授杜格樂氏之關係。轉入巴黎大學。而又爲杜氏之助手。迨一八七八年因巴斯德大醫士徵求醫學合作人。而經杜氏之示意。魯氏往就焉。凡巴醫士之一切研究工作。魯氏無不參加。一八八三年被巴氏遣往埈及研究亞洲式之虎疫。次年返國。巴氏卽使之參加已在進行中之瘋狗病研究。嗣於一八八五至一八八九之數年中。魯氏將其炭疽病之發明及其對於猪豚傳染病之研究。先後宣布。又在同時期中卽自一八八七年以後魯氏與其他二醫士合作而同發明　菌之毒素。按此研究卽爲六年後能使白喉血清得以配成之主因也。自是以來。血清治療之新法始出現於世。而且將日進月邁。毫無止期矣。魯醫士於治療白喉之血清外。又與二三醫士合作製成治療强直痙　·鼠疫·肺炎菌等病之血清。於是巴斯德之創業。經此多才人之發　光大而益使法國之科學得以施其惠澤於世界矣。及至一八九五年巴斯德醫士逝世。杜格樂繼其研究院長之職。而魯醫士副之。嗣於一九○四年杜院長逝世。而魯醫士繼其職。且於一八九五年已被選爲醫學研究院人員。双於一八九九年被選爲理學研究院人員。而魯醫士所得之榮譽褒獎。拾級而上。直至一九二○年得有最高級之榮光獎章。惟自一九○○年後魯氏因操勞過度。亟需調養。故未願參加自三十三年以來能使巴斯德研究院大發光彩之各項發明。然魯氏亦曾盡其指示敎導之職。故其襄助之功。仍亦不可泯没也。且魯氏尤喜維護鼓勵一般不以救利爲宗旨之研究家。例如Ｍetchniket與戈爾梅特二大醫士。皆賴魯氏之力而得成苗者也。魯氏爲人之特性。可一言以蔽之曰虚懹若谷。至其清操。幾及僧侶。而其謙德。尤足欽仰。當其發明治療白喉之血清後。法國大總統Casimir　Perier意欲親自贈以榮光獎章。然事前魯氏未得預知。及總統欲爲之代佩獎章時。魯氏却走而大聲曰。余實無功。此物應歸Behring　所有。於是總統乃不得不强牽其衣而爲之佩帶焉。再魯氏樸素成性。不事修飾。某日爲接洽研究院之津貼問題往謁Rotbschild男爵。閽者見其衣冠敝舊。不願爲通。及三請方爲之傳逹。謁罷。主人送及門。且謂之曰。先生如以一百萬之數尙不足者。請有以告余也。於是閽者大驚。但吾人對於魯氏。不當根據以上之瑣事而斷定其爲一無血性之人物。蓋如魯氏與巴斯德醫士。至爲莫逆。然每因學理之故。而對其業師發表不同之理論。甚至各主一是。堅不相讓。然至次日在化騐室相見。則依然和好如初矣。有時魯氏之見解不謬。一經證實後。巴醫士亦爽直承認之。</p>
<p>魯氏天性中之二大特點。卽淳朴與毅力。吾人已表而出之矣。今須加入第三特點。以完成魯氏之性格。此第三者卽慈愛心是也。魯氏雖終身未娶。然酷愛家庭生活。故與其各親族往來不斷。卽對於一般合作之人。亦異常和露。故人皆樂與之相處。且魯氏之所以苦心研究白喉一病。亦因其慈愛之感念而起。而非爲利也。然則魯氏之所以能發明空前之血清治療新法者。豈不以其有普救羣生之慈愛精神爲之助乎。法國之醫學所以能於四十年來有大進步者。魯氏之功也。</p>
<h3 id="c247">（二）魯氏之博學人物 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>魯氏對於生理學各問題極爲注意。而對於各種病症。亦專心研究。故巴斯德研究院中之合作人。自三十年以來。大都受魯氏之蕭陶。而卽外國之專門研究　菌學者。亦皆可稱爲魯氏之弟子。蓋魯氏曾於一八八九年設立　菌學講演所於Ｄulot街。當時來聽講者多至三千餘人。大部份皆係外國之學者與少年醫士。今魯氏雖已逝世。然其學業已遍傳於世。故魯氏之精神可稱不死。</p>
<p>惟以一般人之觀點而論。魯氏乃一發明治療白喉血清之人。因此魯氏亦爲血清治療法之創造人。</p>
<h3 id="c248">（三）血清治療法 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>巴斯德大醫士乃一發現徵生物界之大家。且曾向黴菌宣戰。而毁其某某要黠。然後則將其學術傳授與其門弟于。其門弟子則又向黴菌進攻。而其中之最有力者。則當以魯愛彌大醫士爲巨擘。魯醫士於一八八七年在巴斯德研究院之週刋内發表一文。詳述用從。黴菌取得之溶液。以爲免疫之法。當時巴斯德大醫士。立卽學悟此項發明之重要。故在理學研究院中。曾於開大會時發表宣言。稱今已證明一種危險而致人速死之病。（白喉）其免疫之法。可於注射化學分量之質以得之。而此質乃得自能死亡之微生物之生命而來。</p>
<p>翌年（一八八八年）魯醫士與耶爾辛合作發明白喉黴菌培養汁中之毒素。（Ｔoxine）嗣後於一八九○年有勃林與吉逹蘇多二醫士。在德國證明以魯耶二醫士發明之毒素。用相當方法注射於獸類身中。其血清卽有抵抗白喉之性能。須知血清者。卽爲血之一部份。迨血質凝結時乃與之分離。故凡經魯耶二醫士毒素注射之獸。因對該毒素發生反應。於是造成一種反毒素。卽有能抵抗白喉性能者是也。</p>
<p>四年之後。卽一八九四年十月間。魯醫士在布逹貝斯脫城之國際衛生大會中。將其與馬西及沙囿二醫士合作而得之最近成績。當衆宣布。其時全世人士無不敬服感戴。而各國之醫士。黴菌學專家及各獸醫。無不爭先恐後。競趨就學新法。或爲得取血清。但以此物極爲稀貴。無從多給。嗣經某報之宣傳。得有捐欵百萬之數。用得以大規模之組織。製造治療所用之血清。以及由魯醫士發明毒素而化成之各種預防藥品（未完）</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>進一步的合作</p>
<p>曾爲電界某雜誌擴文，其時國民政府成立未久，對於發展交通，　論　雜。有擬造成有無綫電各個通信網者，效用非不宏，計書非不詳，但視乎需要，察乎經濟，驚商者竊慮未能深合國情也；故作者當時爲文主張，卽以通信網之成立，應不分有綫無綫之界限：『有綫電報所不能通者，以電話通之；有綫電報電話所不能通者，以無綫電報無線電話通之，交互相通，以造成通逹全國各地之電信網。』</p>
<p>有無綫電，雖定名上有一字之區别，實際上亦有材料機械之不同，但均爲通信利器，可無疑義。自昔軍閥時代，對於有綫無綫，顯爲畫分，各立門户，名爲同隸交通，實則『有』『無』不相調劑。近歲以來，事權旣一，發展亦隨而平衡，茲閱報載，交通部復自四月一日起，頒行有無綫電更進一步之合作辦法。縱實旋步驟，須稍俟斟酌妥善·而『有』『無』相通之原則旣定，則斯後發報者不必問有綫電或無綫電所能通，祗須交由電報局台支配，任其可『有』可『無』，或『無』或『有』，以迅速爲主旨，將無有不可逹者，此實對於公衆通信，便利不少。所謂造成全國爲一大電信網，有無綫電之合作，可稱爲第一步之成功。</p>
<p>試就電報業務上言之，平時國内發生事故，電報往往隨　增加。斯際如無綫電之傳遞繁忙，經此合作，卽得有綫電爲之調劑。疏通報務，支配工作，不啻頭頭是道。所稱綫路擁擠，所謂報務遲延，當能充量减少。『傳遞迅速』四字，在『有無相通』之後，自更切實表現，而使收發報人逾格滿意。</p>
<p>總之，有綫與無綫進一步之合作，在通信上取得聯絡，於業務上增進效能，各國不乏其例，我國亟應倣行，對外辦法，如聯合掛號等已見公佈，至内部實施經交通當局縝密之籌劃，更不難於短時期中實現也。</p>
<h3 id="c254">新生活運動與電界 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>新生活運動，發軔於南昌，而京滬平漢各地繼之，一月以來，風靡全國，從個人衣食住行之檢點，以充實民族社會之基礎，不可謂非根本救亡之策也。　　新生活運動定義，蔣委員長已經說明：卽『人們衣食住行之生活必須合乎福義廉恥』是已。夫禮義廉恥，係吾人精神生活必備之條件衣食住行，係吾人物質生活必備之條件。衣食住行之所需，必合乎禮義廉恥，然後物慾無所蔽；禮義廉恥之精意，必表現於衣食住行，然後操守爲不虚。吾人服務電界，衣食於斯，鑒往察來，對於新生活運動，亟應努力，因舉數項，藉見一斑；所以爲社會告者，亦兼以禮義廉恥自勗也。電信爲國營事業，從前主管長官，多係政界出身，未免帶幾分官氣，局中辦事人員，威風十足，一斑民衆，視電局爲衙門，由來已久。自國民政府交通部成立後，確定電信事業商業化，電局猶之商店，辦事人員係店員，而收發報話人士，卽爲店中竭誠歡迎之顧客。店員對於顧客，須和藹謙遜，不可驕慢無禮，交通部已再三愷切訓戒，而局台人員亦謹守弗怠，惟自勉之餘，固仍盼社會之更加督促也。</p>
<p>凡發寄電報，有普通加急之分，其發遞次序，有等級高下之别。如因業務上之關係，致電報不能送到，或電文錯誤，或投遞太遲之時，電局亦有全部退費或部份退費之條文。此在電報業務規則中已規定明白。蓋電局旣收發報人之報費，應負迅確傳遞之責任，權利義務，不容或紊。義可釋宜，局台人員，盡其能力以爲社會服務，職所宜守，亦卽義之所在也。</p>
<p>電政當局因我國電報價目頗高，不能爲一般民衆所能利用，而在電政經濟奇窘之時，又不能將報價儘量减低，置事業維持於不顧，乃於無可設法之中，規定種種辦法：㈠收報人姓名住址在十五個字以内者，作五字計費：㈡加急電報，改爲加倍收費；㈢郵轉電報，免收郵費；㈣路轉電報，免收過綫費；㈤查復電文疑義字名之公電，准予免費；㈥國内交際電報，無論隔省本省，華文每字一律二分，洋文四分。數月以來，努力在廉字上做工夫，以期引起民衆發電之興趣。至電政主管人員，操守法重廉潔，交部對此，尤加意焉。</p>
<p>交通部恥國際通信之被把持也，故設立國際電臺以補救之，恥報話機器之陳腐也，故購置電報克利轉機，印字機，電話自動式機，以革新之。爲挅取各界人士之意見，乃設置業務稽查員；爲免除電報傳遞之錯誤，乃派定正誤校對員。其他如業務上工程上之設施，當局無不以我國電政，恥不能與歐美並駕齊驅爲念，又無不以我國電政恥不能使全國人士全體利用着想。『知恥有勇』，年來電政各種改革，未始非當局勇於任事之效也。</p>
<p>上述，禮義廉恥之表現於電信界者，祇就所憶及，略爲論列，初無當於大雅；不過際此内憂外患迭來之時，電信界頗有一番朝氣，實與新生活運動之眞義相符。西諺云『事實勝雄辯』，舉而出之，固非有意爲電政作宣傳也。</p>
<h3 id="c255">近年來自動電話發逹之原因 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 李紹美</p>
<p>我國自動電話，輓近何以有長足之進展？此爲一富含興味之問題也。吾人若欲陳述其理由，母　探求其動機及其背景，較爲有當：</p>
<p>（甲）話局原有機件已經窳敗接電話機件之壽命，普通不逾十年。在維持時期，應預謀新陳之替換，或者預儲存欵，至機件不堪使用時，購換新機。顧各局以種種關係，實際上率難顧及，以致機械使用，超逾壽命，業務自亦受其影響，試觀各局之十七年障碍統計，可見一斑。</p>
<p>局别綫路障碍次數内部機件障碍次數用户機件障碍次數</p>
<p>首都二五○一四一三三五六六一八一上海一二一四一四三七二六四七一武漢二九六八一一六二三八二○九二一靑島六六○六三三二一三○二三　　爲求業務上之完善，且爲滿足社會使用上所需要，於是有廢棄人工接綫而代以自動電話之趨向矣。</p>
<p>（乙）話務繁重國内各電話局現行之收費制度，均爲包月制。Flat　rate是以用户使用電話，漫無限制；甚至一户裝機，有與其他數户共用者，觀夫各話局十七年交換統計，其話務之繁重，較諸人口衆多，企業發逹之英美大城市，有過之無不及。</p>
<p>局别用户數每日一用户平均呼數首都二二九一二三</p>
<p>上海二○二七一九</p>
<p>武漢四五一○二○</p>
<p>靑島二六三四一六</p>
<p>各局話務之繁重，旣如上述。則用户常感受『佔綫』『不接綫』等困難，自不待言。爲徹底的改良業務起見，自動電話尙焉。蓋記數制Measured　Service殊難遽行於國内，此又一原因也。</p>
<p>（丙）話務人員難於管理及訓練歐</p>
<p>美各謂話公司，均設有專校，訓練司機生。試觀其交換規則○Peratidgrules　定周詳。自非經一　嚴格的衷練，司機生不易遵守。我國話生，是前學習時間，大抵襲用傳統的『徒弟制』。服務日久，難免習氣日深；使管理上發生困難。反響所至，不外以機械代替人工，此亦自動電話發逹之原因也。</p>
<p>（丁）電話摩登化自動電話，名詞嶄新。今日之談建設事業者，莫不揭緊之以資號召。如四川萬縣用户不過百號，若買磁石交換機，甚爲經濟。然竟探用自動電話者，自根據於國人慕倣時尙之心理，舉此卽可槪其餘矣。</p>
<p>（戌）國外工廠生產過剩邇來歐美各國經濟衰落，各工廠出品，在國内已求過於供，大有生產過剩之患，國設法兜銷海外，欲以遠東爲尾閶，值茲我國整理電氣之際，乃競爭推銷，不遺餘力，蓋自動電話，乃有利事業，自爲國外工廠所視爲目標之一也。</p>
<p>（己）謀通信之秘密及迅速使用人工式電話時，須由司機生居間接綫。卽使其受過充分訓練，每因生理上之變化，及言語間之隔閡，易生誤會。再用户接談，終不信任司機生能絶對遵守規則，不事竊聽。例如武漢政府時代，局用機件，尙爲人工式；而軍政機關，則另以自動機集中之。蓋一則可以保證共談話之秘密，一則於非常事變時，藉交換之迅速，得從空處置之也。其他如鐵道部及瀋陽兵工廠等處，挅用自動電話甚早，均係根據上述理由。</p>

<p>— 羅頡民</p>
<p>晚近研究電報者，均以爲電報應趬趨『電話化』。電報印字機，在歐美各國，雖已普遍，但電信工程帥仍認爲有改進之必要。德國在一九二八年卽有『户内電報』（Residence　Telegrapby）之裝設，租户可向當地電報總局租用專線，在家中或商行内裝一自動電報印字機，與裝有同樣機件之租户直接通報。惟此種機器，因種種關係，僅有少數大公司用之。範圍旣小。普遍不易，德國郵電部有見及此，幾經研究，遂有下列之三大貢獻：</p>
<p>㈠自動電報印字機之擴展預擬在各城市間：利用原有之電話地纜，專供裝有自動電報印字機者之租用。此種電路，將每一租户接通至『自動電報交換所』，再由該所分轉。各租户所用之機件，經管理機關之檢騐後，代爲裝置，由租户自行維持。柏林及漢堡兩城市，業已試辦，並規定每户，每月，每啓羅米突專綫（係指由租户住所至交換所）應納之三種費用如次：</p>
<p>甲，租站費五馬克</p>
<p>已，租線費五馬克</p>
<p>丙，通報費每六分鐘一·分○馬克，每逾二分鐘加三分之一，下午五時至翌晨八時，减收三分之一。</p>
<p>此　述印字　　完全自動，　　　　。租户在室内僅須撥動號盤，（與自動電話號盤同），卽可與其通信人之印字機接通。且因電路充裕，母須等待。如收報人不在室内時，印字樣亦可自動收報，絲毫無誤。機旁有一小箱，上有二鍵及一號盤。發電時，先掀按Service鍵，電路卽通，再撥動通信人之呼號（撥法與自動電話同），俟末號團回時，卽可開始通報。完畢後，掀動Eod鍵，電路立卽拆斷。另有一特别Reply鍵，專爲證對呼呌之用，如發電人於撥動號盤後，欲知是否正接，可掀動此鍵，對方印字機，立卽自動將受電人姓名住址拍出，於是誤接之弊，自可除去。至發電至他處，亦可用同樣手續，免費拍至當地電局團拍云。</p>
<p>㈡話報之輪流使用此種話報輪流並用之電路，爲簡單之交流式，可名爲『單音週波電報』（SingleVocal　Frequrency　Folegraphy），所用之機件，略如圖示。</p>
<p>圖中租户ＦＩ，如欲與租户　經中央電局ＦＡ通話，則分綫鍵Ｕ１，Ｕ１如圖。如欲通報，用以記錄其談話，僅須將分綫鍵Ｕ１，Ｕ２扭團，雙方卽在印字機Ｍ１，Ｍ２通報。完畢後，將話機掛　上，電路卽拆斷。在夜間無人收受電報時，可裝一『夜間分綫鍵』Night　Commutator，收報人外出時，則將此鍵扭轉。話機被呼呌，此鍵能自動使印字機收受電報。停止後，卅秒鐘内並可自動拆斷電路。此項通報費與通話費同，故租户可任意迪報或通話，不受限制。且此種電報機裝設後，關於電話種種，絲毫不受　　。　能否發電　電　轉　　　各地，則尙在研究中。</p>
<p>㈢無綫電自動印字機爲便利同時迅速傳遞金融體育等消息起見，德國正　裝設一種『西門子印字機』SiemensHell　Teleprinter，經由無綫電傳遞。此種機器，購價極廉，管理亦易，任何人均可收發。由中央電站發出消息時，多數電站，均可同時收到。收到之電報，爲傳眞式，與發出者絲毫無異。此種電報之特點，爲簡單，安全，不受長短波之限制，空氣之干優；且任何人亦不能非法竊聽或截收云。</p>

<p>春日晴明，最宜放箏。放箏爲我國舊有之遊戲，及時行樂，自屬正當；故現在有名人士頗多主張提倡者，一般素喜放箏的成人和兒童，聽及這樣的消息，自然格外眉飛色舞，興高彩烈。</p>
<p>不過據報紙記載，航空公司因放箏有碍及航行目標，頗思取締，如此對於放箏，又不啻加以打擊。航空非所習，姑談電綫。常見城市内外之電綫，一至春明時節，每見有斷片殘絲，高掛於綫條之上，此皆行樂的朋友們，放箏的成績，須知綫條不絶地通電，此項斷關殘絲，搭懸其上，一遇天雨，卽成導電之體，妨碍通信。設或箏已墮掛電綫，攀高而取，更有觸電之危險；所以特借本刋篇幅，通知及時放箏的朋友們：</p>

<h3 id="c259">關於長途電話臨時請求撤銷通話 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>交通部去年六月二日公布之長途電話營業通則，已於今年三月一日起明令實行，其第七條第二項有發話人臨時請求撤銷通話者，與第一項同，應收一次通話費三分之一之規定。外間以爲旣未通話而須收三分之一次通話費，跡近苛細爲辭。據記者探詢，交部規定此條，實係顧及用户利益而設，非苛舉也，茲略述之：</p>
<p>查馬德里所修訂之國際電信公約附屬電話規則第三十一條第七節第一項，『除預約通話外，在何通話，如發話機方面或受話機方面拒絶通話者，其應收之費，等於在接到拒絶表示時之收費期限内此兩機作一分鐘普通通話之費，此項話費最少額爲五十生丁』云云。換言之，卽發話人或收話人如拒絶通話者，應收最少額五十生丁之費。交部長途電話勞通則第一條，係根據此節而成立就事實上言之：發話人旣請求通話，發話局必爲之掛號，挨次傳至受話局，然後通知受話人接話，手續頗繁。若發話人臨時請求撤銷通話，在發話局已傳知受話局，或受話局已傳知受話人之時，不獨長途話綫受時間上之損失，而受話人亦感無謂之麻煩。故特訂此條，以示限制。按電報規則内規定。凡發報人請求註銷已經傳遞之電報，電局亦僅退該電未經路程之報費，此正與本條同一意義。</p>
<p>再就用户利益方面言之：如現在京滬報館中，往往不論有無新聞，一至傳遞新聞之最忙時間，卽任意掛號，爭先恐後，迨挨次代爲接通時，該報館如其時尙無所聞可以報告，動輒要求撤銷掛號。如此情形，使長途話綫遭其佔據，厥事猶小，而躭延他家報館新聞之傳遞，影響乃大。故爲謀多數報館便利起見，對於此種撤銷掛號情事，不得不取手續費，究於用户利多弊少也。</p>
<p>總之，發話人臨時請求撤銷通話者，本屬罕有之事，然在立法方面，不得不另訂一條，以期問密。至京滬新綫告成時，通話暢利，不致受掛號過多之影響，自無臨時要求撤銷之舉矣。</p>
<p>一　，於　一　民　要發電報，　寄　件，必　　奔西走，感覺十分不便。便。現在　電旣已合　起來，那末各界發報或寄信，可到同一地方辦理，省去極不少　的麻煩！</p>
<p>第二種就是有無綫電合併的運動，談起有綫電和無綫電，實在是一種形式不同，效果相等的傳遞電報方法。牠們各有長處，各有短處，兩者合併辦理，相互爲用，那末有綫電或無綫電的不近的地方，都弄得通，民衆發寄的電報，才可以安全迅捷地逹到目的地。交通部爲謀民衆發電的安全迅捷起見，所以毅然决然地下令，把有綫電和無綫電自四月一日起合併管理。以後各界發寄電報，簡直可以不必指定走『有綫電』或『無綫電』，决定那種傳遞的方法，因爲有報務上，和技術上的種種關係，儘可放心交托局台收發人員，讓他們去做適合需要的支配是了。</p>
<p>以上兩種運動，是一般的，是普遍於全國的。在上　方面，另外再有　　合作運動，就是把南京路沙遜房子内國際電台，福州露七號上海電報局，民國路無綫電總台，和愛多亞路三十四號大北水綫電報收發處，大東水綫電報收發處及太平洋水綫電報收發處的所有電報掛號，合併起來，統歸新近組織的『上海聯合電報掛號處』辦理。這個運動，範圍似乎較小，然而意義亦很重大，因爲以前上述各處的電報掛號，爲了種種關係如有綫電和無綫電的歧異，國際國内電報的區别，和外人水綫公司立塲的不同丨丨是不統一的。結果咧！有的要收掛號費，有的免費，有的幾個掛號户用一同樣的掛號字。辦法參差！糾紛時起，實在是在家感受不便的痛苦。現在各處的電報掛號統一起來了！各商行只要在『上海聯合電報掛號處』納費掛號以後·就可通用於有綫電，無綫電和各路水綫傳遞的電報，辦理劃一，糾紛免除，對於上海發寄電報的人士，眞是便利多多了。</p>

<p>— 楊光序</p>
<p>吾人於迥憶我國國際貿易史中，卽覺絲茶兩者在我國對外貿易上如何重要。然此光榮早已不復重見於世矣。茶業衰落於前，絲業不振於後。雖至今日，有議之士均倡整頓蠶絲之議。近日全國經濟委員會更爲復興我國絲業誌，有蠶絲改良委員會招錄育蠶女生之舉。亡羊補牢，自屬善舉，然吾人設環觀今日之勢，則覺有爲時勿及之慨。以意日兩國蠶絲事業之急進於前，復有人造絲之威脅於後。是則我國之絲業能否有中興之望，實爲疑問。本文之旨，一方固在叙述我國絲業在國際市塲之落伍，他方欲着重絲業之强毅的人造絲業之極度進展。對世界絲業，不但我國之威迫已足使人生畏。請先略述近年來世界之絲業市塲。</p>
<p>據法國Mssrs　MorelJournel　etCie之估計一九三二至三三年世界之絲業又形降落，產量旣已减少，而價格亦步趨疲弱。</p>
<p>世界生絲之供給（千噸）</p>
<p>由出口一九一三一九三０一九三一一六三二米一九三三至一四至三一至三二至三三至三四</p>

<p>產量將减少，實因紐約及日本國内所存之絲過多，故日本或將壓低其生產。</p>
<p>由上觀得，世界絲之供給自一九三○年後已漸减少，若依供求之律而言，則絲價定應上漲，今用不然。其故何在。蓋人造絲已逐漸取蠶絲而代之故也。吾人據同上之來源，則知絲債不但未上漲，反而跌勢甚烈。謂觀下表，在里昂所開之各種絲之價格。（平均數）單位佛郎出產地一九二九年一九三０年一九三一年一九三二年一九三三年</p>

<p>上海三○○九○一五五一○五七八四川二四五四○一二五八五七○無錫七五六五五○三六</p>
<p>日本二八五一七○一四五九二六二　　由上可知，世界絲業市塲之衰落已邁步速進，去年之平均市價僅及一九二九年四分之一。日本方面以日金貶價之故，損失尙少，而我國之絲商於此狂跌之下，已無法將其貨供於市塲求售奚。然則今日之所謂整頓蠶絲事業，其所能得之　東，恐渺乎其小矣。若以世界的眼光觀察。即使我國能復　絲業，而其在國際市塲之地位如何尙難逆料。或直言之，今日之蠶絲并不爲無可代替之品，絲之需要，在實際上已不積極矣。</p>
<p>追本溯源，卽可知絲業之衰落，固非僅限於我國。而人造絲之氣勢，已足令蠶絲失色。從前需要絲之國家，或已設法增加人造絲之之製造，或自他國購買人造絲以代替之。</p>
<p>近年世界各主要人造絲製造國家，均積極增加其生產，且世界之需要亦促其加工趕製。吾人爲根本認議絲業之何以衰落，對此人造絲事業不能不加以檢討也。</p>
<p>在英國及其他國家對人造絲業製造技術之進步，已使人造絲紗足以在品質上，實用上可作爲各種紡織物之用。同時價格方面，因工作效能之增進，愈可低落。於是使蠶絲業之需要大受打擊。卽棉與毛方面亦復影響不小。</p>
<p>查人造絲世界產量最多者，厥爲美國，始終保其領袖地位，吾人可得世界人造絲各國生產數，列表於下，（單位千磅）</p>
<p>國别一九三三一九三二一九三一一九三０</p>
<p>美國一七二、一０五一三一、０八五一四０、八００一一五、０００日本八九、九二五六四、三九五四六、七五０三三、三三０英國八四、０八０七二、五一０五四、五七０四八、八七０意大利八二、０四０七０、一四五七六、一二０五九、七００德國六八、二００六四、六八０五五、０００五七、八八０法國五七二００四七、二五五三六、三六五三九、一六０荷蘭二三、六五０一九、四０五一九、八００一五、八四０瑞士一０、五六０二、０五五九、九００九、六００比利時九、六０五九、七八０一０、三九五一０、四五０加拿大七、六一０七、一二０五、五六五四、八四０其他一０、四九五二一、一四五一五、五二五五五總數六二五、四七０五一八、五七五四七０、七九０四一０、二二五由上可知，人造絲業實與蠶絲呈相反之現勨，去年度產量之增加，竟逹一萬萬餘磅，吾人對　人造絲業之進展，似不可忽視也。</p>
<p>日本去年之產量增加逹二千萬餘磅，日本之生產量以原料價較低，同時加以人工特療，故在國際市塲上足與他國競爭，尤以在遠東方而，人造絲織物與棉織者競爭更烈。</p>
<p>英國之產量亦增一千萬餘磅，其所增加者多於國内市塲卽已消費，並不需用以出口，自去年一月各製造公司决定加速生產量百分之三十，並每磅减低三便士，且加工之後，並不需要多建廠房，祇需將現存之廠加以改進卽可，故成本上已較减輕，在英國之情形此實有漸與棉成對立抗術之勢，伹英國對人造絲所規定之稅率極高，故亦難與棉對抗，推對　絲之競爭，並不因此影響，因蠶絲之稅求亦較高故也，　　在美國方面，去年產量固爲增加最多者，在四千萬磅以上，尤以一種酷酸　（Acelale）之人遣絲最爲可畏，因若干衣粉均可用其織成，不遇價格較一般者爲高，但其消費數量並不因此稍衰，尤以去年底銷路最旺，凡製内衣者大有非此不可之勢。</p>
<p>此外歐洲大　方面此種實業之進展，亦未可厚非，意大利及荷蘭均極力增加製造，用以出口與日本之絲業相競爭，且卡特兒（Cartel）制度在歐尙盛行，謀布塲價格之種定一律，法國亦努力增加製造以圖减少蠶絲之進口，</p>
<p>以近年來人造絲業之興起，蠶絲大受打擊，從前銷場最大之美國，已爲人造絲業之領袖，而素以里昂絲市稱著之法國，亦加緊其人造絲之製造及使用，可知今日之蠶絲，似有落伍之慨，然而不然，哥人决不可因此而放　其整頓，蠶絲之爲物竞有人造絲所不能及者甚多，今日人造絲之所以充斥者，蒼以價廉物美之故，然其不能經久耐用爲世人所共知，其於蠶絲價格自較人造爲高，然其耐用非人造所能及，更以世界經濟衰落，各國人民購買力均低减，乃多捨經久耐用之蠶絲，而取價廉易敗之人造者，</p>
<p>且以我國情形而言，蠶絲之整理，景之增加尙在其次，最要者厥爲質之改進，若能在質方面切實整頓，一方固可與日意者相競爭，他方足以逐以造絲之氣燄於烏有，茲者正值高唱蠶絲整頓之計，惟望國人能認清目前之弊端所在，然後對症發藥，方足以言復與之望，惟我國人努力焉，</p>
<h3 id="c265">再論漁業調查及其方策 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 若搴</p>
<p>日前報載當局將謀統制全國漁業，</p>
<p>閱後之雀躍，想漁業界人，俱有同感</p>
<p>，日前嘗論統制之基礎，在於理事之</p>
<p>明白，而明白事理，要在詳實之調查</p>
<p>，茲再就管見所及，與社會人士一研討之，</p>
<p>漁業調查者，其在各國，咸認爲一切漁業設施最主要之基本工作，他不必論，卽如日本於一九三一年創始之農山漁村經濟更生運動，當時以前數年各方經濟之不景氣，致生產物異常下落，大以農山漁村更感疲弊，於是在農林省成立經濟更生部，内分四課，專司其事，一方舉辦各種演講會，以事宜傳，一方與水產界兩大權威之大日本水產會及帝國水產會聯合舉行漁村經濟調查，其調查之意義，卽在於確知漁村之經濟的產業的種種情形，以及該處之環境社會狀况等，以便樹立之農山漁村經濟更生計劃之方針，以日本素來注重調查，有各地歷年統計，尙須於計劃方針之初，作大規模之詳密調查，是足見凡欲謀事業之改進與建設，必自調查入手也，</p>
<p>今吾國漁業之狀况，不見夫漁船之日少乎？魚價之日落乎？而舶來水產品之如潮湧進，外海海盜之多如牛毛，凡此循環周轉之結果，乃促成漁業之整個破產，是以民元以來，水產界前輩已奔走呼號，希冀漁業之復興，於是創設水產學校者有之，舉辦新式漁輪者有之，成立漁業試騐塲者亦有之，寢假而至今日，已使國家社會咸知漁業之重要，不見報章之宣傳乎？政府之計劃乎？然而吾國漁業之狀况，究何如乎？恐屬　然，大都暗中摸索，致使宜傳之文字，易如過眼之雲烟，計劃之舉辦，却如沙漠之築舍，是所以二十餘年來聲嘶力竭，高呼提倡，而迄今未收毫末功也！此而非未能詳知吾國原來情况之故耶？是所以論者以爲欲謀吾國漁業之整理與開發，必自調查始也，</p>
<p>雖然，調查一事，其進行之困難，夫人而知，漁業調查自亦不能例外，是以必經有確切之調查計劃，乃能按圖索驥，獲有成效，論者以爲吾國今日需要之漁業調查，其目的在於調查全國漁業之經濟的技術的種種情形，以編製調查報告，作爲研究及建議漁政設施漁業建設之用，而其最大之目的，復在於作爲將來統制之參考，俾謀整個漁業之振興也，故調查區域，宜乎遍及全國，但以漁業範圍廣大，當以調查海洋漁業爲先，同時擇淡水漁業之重要者，先行辦理，致調查之範圍，自應遍及各方，如經濟條件之勞力·資本·運貿易·漁村組織，漁民生活，自然條件之漁塲，漁產，漁期·技術條件之漁船，漁具，漁法，養殖，製造等項，以及有關各條件之人口·文化·交通·消費力·勞力·物價等，俱不能貿然掛漏，致調查之方策，自應親歷調查爲要，故　設立全國漁業調查之總機關，擬定調查計劃，然後按步就班，逐漸進行，乃能收效宏大，</p>
<p>然則調查之方策，究何如乎？論者以爲舉行各地漁村之實際調查，以備將來措置漁村之安定，以及運銷之統制，一方擇全國重要生產之漁業，（尤其是帶有遠洋性之漁業）個别調查，以作生產統制之一技，請一申論之，吾人何爲而提倡漁村之調查乎？乃漁村爲漁業之發祥地點，亦爲國家之自洽單位，而吾人所希望於漁村者，更在於漁村之樂土化，是凡漁村之居民，須有共存共榮之精神，漁撈養殖之技術，對漁塲水族，須加以愛護，對自身作業，須刻苦耐勞，然後漁村安定，而漁業可因以振與，雖然吾人尙不能言漁村繁榮之方策也，蓋今日吾國之漁村，雖知破產崩潰，然一究破碎崩潰之程度如何？則又難獲肯定之斷語，如何能　乎整理，措置自如？况漁村自身亦有其内在之困難在，蓋漁村之漁民與農村之農民，其生產也，炯然有别，乃農民有所耕作地之土地權，有其土地上所產不移動生產物之所有權，（雖然現在很多租地耕種之農民，但理論上總之是如此的，而漁民也多是借貸經營的）是以其自身之勞力，勤勉，技術等，俱爲彼直接利害之關鍵，故農民工作可不害他人，而亦不受他人之害，然漁民則反是，行漁於公共所用之水面丨漁塲丨以捕捉移動性之水族，且所謂漁業者，不論任何人，在任何時間，任何漁塲，俱得自由經營，於是如不是捕，卽爲他人所捕，而早捕則害他人，故沿岸漁塲，卽成漁村民之戰塲，而漁民之勤勉技術，祇成爲武器而已，是以欲使淗村經營之合理化，漁村狀態之樂土化者，必促成其互助之精神，復以各地漁村之環境爲背彤，因地制宜，予以解决衝突，而後始有望也，然而欲以指導統制之力，以收漁村繁榮之效，因地制宜，措置自如，是非舉行各個漁村經濟之調查，實不爲功也，今請以事實言之，則江浙之墨魚漁業，昔者以拖網捕捉，今温台漁民以墨魚籠捕捉，但墨魚籠之功能，以能减少勞力，增多漁獲，於是自以爲改進漁具有功、到處濫捕、然墨魚籠之敷設，爲定置漁具之一種，每占去漁塲面積之大半，使原有漁民失其生產途徑，且籠上常粘有墨魚之卵，收取漁獲之際，必用刀棍括去，因而不能孵化者必多，將使墨魚之蕃殖，受極大之妨礙，於是原有漁民亦振振有辭，必欲驅除此項猗形之發展，而漁村之間，衝突乃起，以素向漁政之竄敗，又未能熟知個中情形，以致造成緣華山雙方械鬥之血案，故如將各地漁村情形調查明白，置相當之漁業管理人員指導人員，則敎育之，指導之，改善漁村組織，以促成互助互愛精神，一方以行政力量，劃分漁區，試騐技術，以進行保護蕃殖，增多生產，則漁村自能安定，漁業自能振興，此所以論者以爲舉行漁村經濟調查之不可或缺者也，</p>
<p>吾人何爲血提倡重要漁業之個别調查乎？蓋重要之漁業，規模旣大，生產復多，牽連各方亦甚，俱足以影響全國漁業界之盛衰，故視事實需要，應組織是項漁業之國體，以　統制之便利，卽在其自身言，則是項漁業各有其共同需要之技術，共同需要之設備，故組織是項漁業之團體，將所有是項漁業之經營者，統歸統制，則目標旣一，利檴復同，始可共同計劃，以求其本身之改進，且重要漁業，各有其對内共同之點，對外不同之點，是所以必須個别調查，且在調查之事實言之，則重要漁業，大都捕魚之範圍極廣，如分區調查，而牽涉至二省二區以上者，則措置必感困難，且所謂重要漁業者，每帶有遠洋漁業之性質，其漁塲，漁具以及經營各端，俱不能束縳於漁村，况重要漁業當如何撫育这，保養之，助長之，使成爲正式之遠洋漁業，俾促整個漁業之振興，是又所以重要漁業之需個别調查也，再吾國有遠洋漁業可能性者，每不能往外海捕魚，大都轉輾於沿岸漁塲，是故必須個别之予以統制，促發前進，如吾國之新式輪船漁業，何一而非轉輾於沿岸之漁塲，是以創辦迄今，反而漁獲减少，復使沿岸漁業者受其打擊，論者以爲近年漁業之慘落，於此亦不無關也，雖然漁輪業者，亦必有其困難者在，如資本之不足，技術人才之缺乏，且漁輪業者俱爲營業性質者，不能抛棄捕漁工作，以調查海洋，探索漁塲，故先應確知目前之情形，調查詳實，促成斯業團體，由最高漁業統制機關直接統制，予以技術上（指導者之設置，調查船之舉辦）經濟上（低利借貸，獎勵金之設置）之種種助力，則遠洋漁業之成立有望，而整個漁業之振興亦有望也，是所以讑者以爲欲謀漁業之整理與開發者，則舉行重要漁業經濟之調查，不可缺然者也。</p>
<p>至調查之万策，自以設立全國漁業調查所爲要，復由總所與各省市合組分所，然後由總所舉行重要漁業之個别調查，分所舉行漁村之調查，凡兩方調查之結果，分别編製統計報告，　送總所研究，然後公諸社會，共同研討，茲就管見所及，草就組織綱要，聊資並獻，並就正焉。</p>
<p>一·組織全國漁業調查所下設總務調查出版三課，復與各省市先後合組調查分所，亦設總務調查出版三課，但總所之下，尙組研究委員會，分漁村組織系，漁業經濟系，漁業技術系，編繹系四系，復設訓練委員會，分技術訓練班，漁村敎育班，倉庫管理班（關於魚市塲水產倉庫之管理事宜），</p>

<h3 id="c274">甘地的勝利 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 環聲</p>
<p>以倡導不合作主義來謀印度民族獨立解放之聖雄甘地氏·於本月七日勸令國人：『爲爭自由起見，暫停民事抵抗』。這勸令一出，英人認爲『甘地此舉大有影響及於全國局勢，覺宜有一種酬答恣勢，故將逐漸釋放不合作之政治犯···關於防亂閣令之立法案，雖一時未必取消，但將擱置···禁止國民大會之令，亦將撤消，而許國民大會之總部，與各省支部重開會議』云云。</p>
<p>這被稱爲印度民族運動領袖的甘地，以嶙峋瘦骨，自倡行經濟不合作主義謀求獨立解放許多年來，曾屢次瑯璫入獄，且至憤而絶食，都不能在所謂國民會議及圓桌會議上爭得到若何結果，今竟以小小勸令，獲得大英帝國的開恩發赦，不能不算是他致力民族運動的空前勝利。</p>
<p>可是由於這一勝利，再想到三萬萬印度人民的前途，却使我們哭笑不得。因爲現代帝國主義列强之侵略弱小民族殖民地，固然經濟上的掠奪爲其終極目的，但是維持牠這一經濟的搾取，却有政治上强大的海陸空軍事勢力，若不用民族革命戰爭的形式來·與以粉碎·所謂解放獨立云者，不過等於酣睡中的夢　。這樣的了解·已經使我們認議甘地的所謂經濟不合作主義，將使印度的民族解放走到甚麽途徑了，何况現在『爲爭自由起見，暫停民事抵抗』，連這一點都已抛棄。</p>
<p>在英國經濟勢力上完全統制了整個社會生活的印度情况下，倡行經濟不合作主義，若能實現的話，那無異於三萬萬印度人民爲『不合作』犧牲，餓以待斃，若不然則是一部份人以解放獨立爲名之自欺欺人的幻想。也許是因爲印度是『清凈無爲的出產聖地，不重武力，使不合作主義還能在那兒暗滋潛漲，但實質上那是等於扼着自已咽喉憑人宰割的滑稽事實，所以不管甘地腦裹的高尙理想是甚麽，在客觀上他無論如何是印度民族解放獨立的障礙。在蒙蔽人民思想，使之脫離政治鬥爭限於消極的，不合作的意義上，在消沈人民勇氣·只恃經濟排斥而不圖武裝反抗的意義上，與其說甘地是印度民族獨立解放的領袖，到無寗說他是這一運動的罪人。</p>
<p>現在甘地是一再轉變，由不合作而『暫停民事反抗』了，使英國用獄中優待參加圓桌會議之勸誘方式所不能逹到的目的，一旦竟得實現，怎麽不使心勞日拙的英人『表示歡印』呢？尤其是印度北部不久前的武裝騒動，自然此風不可漲，大有借重此老之處，這就是英國之所以『皇恩大赦』，而甘地得到不合作的勝利了。</p>
<p>甘地這一勸令，英人名之爲『新不抵抗主義』，當然舊者聞之必慶『吾道不孤』，但論新者所得功猷，就令人有『負德』之感了。</p>
<h3 id="c275">無聊的人們 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>每天在生活的漩渦中打轉，一個例外的禮拜六下午對於我是應該怎樣的興奮？每個人在期望這一天的來到，我也這末想過，在工作的時候。我能每天過着禮拜六，不是很好的嗎？我能安坐終日，無所事事，做一個幸福的人。禮拜六終於在我盼望中到了，然而我這顆不安定的心却又盼望牠快些過去，明天就是拜禮一更好。我不能休息，要每天，每小時像牛馬一般的工作着，使我没有餘閑來想起過去的一切，過去的一切不能在我腦海中重映的。但是禮拜六來了，這是個休息的日子，我吃過午飯，安閑地坐在沙發裹抽烟，拒絶了每一個同事們的邀請，出神似的望着天花板。拖烟一枝接着一枝，我能這樣坐過一天嗎？最後自已發問，就像要去幹某一件事似的站起身來往外就走。門外是熱鬧的馬路，人塞滿在電車裹，汽車裹，走着的也是人，肩碰着肩，誰都有事幹。我呢？走過一個朋友的家，往彿特地去拜望他似的叩了門。跑上樓梯，推進亭子間。我的朋友獨自躺在床上着書，他溪起身來說來得正好，悶死人也！懶懶地打起哈欠來。我也不禁私是發笑福拜六有和我一樣厭悶的人。走近他床邊·那本盍着的書是一册七俠五義，相對着放聲大笑。</p>
<p>『小俠艾虎，武藝超羣？』我說。</p>
<p>『我也不知道是本什麽書，隨手拿來看了，其實並没有看到什麽，你那裹來？』</p>
<p>『一樣無聊，才來瞧你。』</p>
<p>『外面去走走罷。』他没有徵求我同意，戴了呢帽頭也不回的往外走。我彷彿覺得這舉動很合理的，代他帶上了門。走出弄口，脚步同時放慢，互相注視了一下，似乎徵求『到那裹去？』但是誰都不願意把這意思吐露出來，仍一步不停留的向西走了。</p>
<p>『到法國公圓去罷。』我們起頭來瞧瞧天上的雲，不知是否想到今天不會下雨的。</p>
<p>『有派司嗎？』對方似乎感動了。</p>
<p>我搖搖頭，又沉默下去。兩個身體一停的向前拖，走到了一所綠牆的電影院門前，三三五五的人塞了進去，而且不繼續的。我們對墻壁上巨大的畫片呆視了半嚮，不自主的踏上了石級，四毛錢在櫝票櫃前換了兩張票。進去的時候電影已在開映了，我們因爲這裹來過幾次的緣故，很自然的沿着墻壁走向前去。在黑暗中忽然被人　阻『這裹四角。』『二角的在那裹？』我們問。</p>
<p>『在後面。』</p>
<p>『換了花樣？』</p>
<p>『今天跳舞。』</p>
<p>我望着我的朋友，大槪他也望着我的，在黑暗中，誰都瞧不見誰的，再退到後面坐定了。畫面上是五六年前的西部影片；有蒙面的大盜，官兵，女郎，打刦，追　，使滿院子的觀衆大笑。</p>
<p>電影莫明其妙的完了，接着是跳舞，大批觀衆不約而同的擁到前面去，幾個Ｂoy把他們攔阻了，他們祇能站在二角座的最前面。</p>
<p>活的美人，肥的玉腿，高的乳峯，聳的圓醫，在紅色的燈光下一一搬上舞台。没落的俄矞貴族，她們暴露着肉體，博得這言觀衆的歡笑，鼓掌。</p>
<p>擠出門來，是晴朗的天，太陽光照在地上人影零亂着，我仰起頭來，『大槪不會下雨罷。』心中這樣想。</p>

<p>— 忘我</p>
<p>住的方面，東京的旅館每天至少得費了四塊錢，供給兩頓飯。蓋的被大都是木棉的，不像我國的很軟的棉被，而且他們的被是很厚的，偶然去用用，不大舒服，而且容易着寒呢。地板每天擦得很光滑，我們初進去也許要跌的。日本的浴室是很便宜的，每次五錢所以他們有了一種愛好洗澡的癖性，至於揩布和肥皂這類公用的東西呢，都得各自帶去，以重衛生，</p>
<p>行的方面，尤其在東京是格外的便利了。所謂東洋車、黃包車）比這裹高大，每次車費約一元，車夫只要每天拉二三次就不拉了。汽車呢，密如網綫，在街頭兜攬生意，祇要你一舉手招呼，車就開過來載了你去，每次大約要五十錢（合中國半元左右），電車呢，不論遠近，五錢足矣，還有高街軌道，在每一個熱鬧的幾义　口，上面空中架着火車的軌道。此外地下鐵道很多，這和大量的汽車於將來的大戰都有帮助，並且地下道很廣大，一旦東京有戰，還可容納全市的小學生繼續去念書，不僅交通之方便已也。提起大戰的凖備，那是日本人處處着眼着底，好比小學校的高大校舍，上面還是平頂，並不想當操塲用，一旦有事，上面都可以架起高射砲，而且每隔多少路必有一所小學校，近來，差不多每月建設一個小學校，如此，東京的防空設備上又多了好多便利了。</p>
<p>最後說一些日本人的德性吧。</p>
<p>日本的文化原是中國傳過去的，所以『敬』是極推重的。他們不但敬人，而且還敬神，各處都有神宮，凡是經過的人都要向這宮行敬禮，而這所謂神宮呢，裹邊是空無所有！每一個有功國家的忠臣過世以後，便多出一個神，全國人敬仰他。至於泥塑的佛像，當然也有存在的，日本人還能做到『勤』字，觀於近提的進步就可知了。還有好多博物館動物院植物院等，使養成一種研究科學的興趣，所以日本人的文化是融合中西的文化，是進步國家的文化。</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3 id="c277">同居偕老 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>茲有敝友一事，請卽於收信後，在業餘信箱答覆。不特敝友感謝，卽鄙人亦甚感激。草此卽請</p>
<p>撰安鄙人文輝謹上</p>
<p>敝友陳君，他是個肄業商人，去年二月間結識一個十八歲的女子，同她發生戀愛；他們的感情，非常的熱烈。那女子的父親在國十一年間去逝，她的母親因家境關係，將其女兒許與同村一個以農爲業的人家，當時卽過門爲童養媳。後來，她夫家於去年十月間看定了吉日要結婚，她一得到這個消息，極力</p>
<p>反抗，竟要自殺，但毫無結果，被她母親逼迫不過仍不由自主，依然與她的未婚夫結婚。當然雙方的意見是不合的，所以她現在决意與敝友同居偕老，否則寗願自殺。此種難題，請先生指示一個完全辦法。問題是：</p>
<p>㈠敝友否認同居，如何解决？</p>
<p>㈡敝友同她同居，是否犯罪？</p>
<p>㈢她向丈夫離婚，用怎樣手績纔可生效？</p>
<p>㈣倘使不能脫離敝友對她，怎樣辦法？</p>
<p>答：這個問題在現社會是很難得到圓滿解决的。因爲第一她要與她的丈夫離婚，就很難辦到。離婚有兩種，一是恊議離婚，就是她與她的丈夫都願意離婚，這是比較容易，不過事實上她丈夫未必能答應；一是呈訴離婚，這就要先具備了法定離婚條件，綫可進行，照你來信所說，她似乎尙未具備這些條件。至於不離婚，竟與尊友同居或結婚，更是違法的事。所以她如果决意要與尊友同居偕老，而又想用合法行爲解决，恐怕未必有望。</p>
<p>然則，他們究竟怎麽辦呢？編者思維再三，認爲他們只二條路可走。第一，她雖然心裹討厭她的丈夫，但如他對於她並不怎麽虐待，能够敷衍過去時那末，她也可不必堅持與尊友同居，祇要他們兩人能够做一個精神上的朋友，互相慰藉，也儘够了。友之，她實有不能再繼績與其夫同居的若衷，那就應當堅决的與她丈夫脫離，而與尊友結合，用正當辦法違到目的當然是再好没有，就是用不正當辦法，也不能說壞，也是應當用的。因爲這種婚姻原是不合理啊！編者</p>

<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>讀自由談李輝英的『半天的功課』，才知道僞滿洲也產生了一首國歌，歌詞是這樣的：</p>
<p>天地間，有了新滿洲：</p>
<p>新滿洲，便有新天地，</p>
<p>頂天立地，無苦無憂。</p>
<p>造成新國家只有親愛並</p>
<p>無怨仇人民三千萬，</p>
<p>縱加十倍，也得自由，</p>
<p>重仁義，尙禮讓使我身修</p>
<p>。家已齊，國已治，</p>
<p>此外何求。近之則與世</p>
<p>界同化，遠之則與天地</p>
<p>同流。</p>
<p>據說這歌是鄭孝胥手作。這位老頭兒的學問，本有根底，寫來自然有聲有色。可惜他現時已經喪心病狂，鞠躬盡瘁去作他主子的奴才，故措詞未免顚倒錯亂。難道他不知道僞國是由日人一手所造成，東北人民處在兩重壓迫之下，受着極大的痛苦，致寢食不寗，坐臥難安，而竟歌頌出什麽『無苦無憂』，什麽『也得自由』一類的欺誑語，眞屬荒謬之至！『家已齊，國已治，』兩名更不像話！幾千萬東北同胞正在親嘗着『家破國亡』的苦味呢！　　爲求名實相符起見，我現在且來把這首僞歌改一改，詞句也許不及鄭老頭子的老練，意思總比他的貼切。歌曰；</p>
<p>天地間，有了僞滿洲：僞滿洲，便有僞天地；昏天黑地，慘苦悉憂：造成僞國家，利權外溢，金錢東流！彊城有四省，人民三千萬，</p>
<p>兩重壓迫難得自由！敵人血，漢奸肉，吃盡方休！家已破，國已亡，此身何留！今日且偕同胞忍辱，來日去向日本雪仇！</p>

<p>六爺並不說話只晤地應一聲，向烟舖上面躺下去，烟燈點好了的，拿起烟槍就燒雅片。六爺在族内是威嚴不過的，蓮孫和桂孫並不繼續剛才的爭論，只是默然的坐着。窗外雨聲和房子裹頭的抽烟聲在交響着。二爺進來了。一眼看見六爺在抽大烟，走近烟舖坐下，也躺下去了。六爺眼尾瞥到，忙將烟槍拿開，吐了一口烟霚呌聲，『二哥！』再儘量地抽個徹底。大烟抽完後，六爺坐起身來說，</p>
<p>『鑑光回來了？』蓮孫先驚異地問了一聲。</p>
<p>二爺並不回答。他心裹頭想起了兩年前的事件還有餘恨，聽了立爺的話，以爲他還要收留他的見子，不禁由恨生惱，半響才從烟舖上面坐起身來。只見他的鬍子在抖戰着，眼晴睜得那麽大，又半響地才說出話來。</p>
<p>『老六，這種兒子還可以收留的嗎？當年農會在胡行覇道的時候，不是他在東敎塲的農民大會上面，高聲地喊着要打倒土豪劣紳，先打倒肇先二爺和雨亭六秀嗎？好在現在將那班衣冠禽獸殺死了好多，我們鄭家才有今日！現在他回來了，不做死他，鄭家一族也不承認你老六姓鄭！』說着下了烟舖在房子裹頭走動起來。</p>
<p>丫頭在門口請吃飯，二爺氣得不去理她，大少爺蓮孫趕到門口輕聲地吩咐慢點開飯，說有事呢。用人點過燈來，大少爺蓮孫接過手自已拿進房子裹頭放在書桌子上面。燈光照着二爺的身體，影子在地下走動着。</p>
<p>六爺還是沉默着，低下了頭。二爺在房裹走着忽然站住，又說，</p>
<p>『自已趕快到縣公署報告，請派基幹隊到你家裹抓人！』六爺這時才抬起頭來說，</p>
<p>『我也曾經這樣想着。不過，這辦法不大妥當。』</p>
<p>『怎麽不大妥當？』二爺以爲六爺反對他的主張，盛氣的責問起來。</p>
<p>『二哥知道的，前年因爲我有這個不肖兒子，衙門裹頭當部裹頭恐嚇着我，要三千兩大堆，後來被敲了不少的錢。這回如果說他回到家裹、不是又要化錢嗎？』</p>
<p>『　化什麽錢。』</p>
<p>『到家裹抓人的基幹隊，送些吃烟吃酒的錢是少不了的。而且，我還恐怕着那些吃蛇呧虎血的人要乘機拿你幾件東西走呢！』</p>
<p>『那末·老六！你究竟打要定什麽主意？』</p>

<h3 id="e1">Convening an Important Meeting; Those Attending Were All Key Diplomatic Personnel, Seemingly to Discuss the North China Issue <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Side is Eager to Coerce Us into Allowing Through Traffic and Postal Services</p>
<p>Intending to Achieve a Comprehensive Solution to Plan Against Russia</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang convened a meeting at the Ministry of Railways official residence at 7 p.m. on the 15th. Those invited were all key personnel from the diplomatic community, seemingly to discuss Sino-Japanese issues. (15th Dispatch) (Nanjing) A certain important person said that the core of the North China issue is the Japanese side's eagerness to coerce us into allowing through traffic and postal services, comprehensively resolving all conditions since the Tanggu Truce, first to allow the economic development of Manchukuo to extend towards North China, and second, as the situation between Japan and Russia becomes increasingly serious, a solution to the Sino-Japanese issue would allow Japan to concentrate its forces against Russia. Our side, with the suppression of bandits within the country being extremely urgent, has no opportunity at this time to discuss this Sino-Japanese diplomacy. In the event of a sudden outbreak of war between Japan and Russia, there is deep concern as to whether North China, Chahar, Suiyuan and Xinjiang will unfortunately become battlefields. The Japanese side hopes to unite with the United States and Britain to jointly resist Russia, and recently plans to sign a non-aggression pact between Japan and the United States, while making concessions to Britain, fully accepting proposals on arms reduction. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee, upon referral from the General Assembly, drafted opinions on how to deal with North China diplomacy, intending to submit a report to the General Assembly on the 20th. The main idea, as heard, is to first describe the complex and chaotic situation in North China today. With national territory not yet recovered and a strong neighbor pressing the border, the difficulty of the diplomatic situation is indeed understood by the people. However, the development of the diplomatic future depends on the consolidation of the international stance. Since September 18th, the Chinese government has consistently regarded the lost territory of the Northeast as being under Japanese military occupation, and the so-called puppet organizations as purely Japanese puppets. The Universal Postal Convention denies the existence of puppet organizations. This kind of international moral assistance is a representation of a just and upright international stance. China's attainment of international sympathy is indeed as it should be, but it is also not easy. How should we maintain our stance in the future to comfort international sympathy? Otherwise, international righteousness will not be destroyed by Japan's temptation, but destroyed by our country's self-imposed isolation. The crisis of the future is too painful to speak of. It also lists that during the European War, when Germany occupied Belgium, although Belgium was in a state of national fragmentation, it strongly struggled to recover its homeland. Today's China, with thorns everywhere, is indeed full of crises, but it is much better than Belgium during the European War. Finally, it exhaustively states the opinions on how to deal with the various points coerced by the Japanese side. Matters relating to diplomatic secrets are omitted. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Gubeikou: The Puppet Police Have Not Yet Withdrawn <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the withdrawal of the Gubeikou puppet police, when Chaisan, Matsui, and Machijiri arrived at Gubeikou, they met with Huo Shi and promised to withdraw by the end of the month, without mentioning the issue of money. Now the Japanese side has again claimed to us that the puppet police built houses outside the pass, requiring more than ten thousand yuan, and requested our side to provide it. Therefore, the withdrawal of the puppet police has once again become a problem. Whether it can be withdrawn within the month is currently undecided. It is heard that this matter requires Yin Rugeng to return from Yutian to Beiping for further negotiation. (15th Dispatch) (Beiping) Huo Shi and Liu Youxun came to Beiping, reported on the current situation of Gubeikou, and decided to return to Gu on the 16th and find ways to suppress the activities of traitors in various counties. The long-distance telephone between Yutian and Beiping has been connected, and the connection between Ping and Gu will be possible within days. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The construction of the long-distance telephone between Beiping and Tianjin to Malanyu is being actively carried out after the provincial government allocated funds. Due to the long route, it will still take two weeks to complete the line. The long-distance telephone between Gubeikou and Beiping can be put into operation next week. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Huang Fu Departs Ganzhou by Ship; Passed Through Nanjing Yesterday Afternoon Without Landing; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu passed through Nanjing at noon on the 15th on the Jiangxin steamer without landing. A certain reporter boarded the ship to visit Huang and inquired if he had any opinions on North China diplomacy. Huang replied that he was a local official and would listen to the government in all matters, with no particular opinions to express. He added that his physical strength was insufficient, and he had submitted a request to the central government to resign, and would return to his hometown to rest. His tone suggested that his resignation was not completely decided. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu recently summoned Yin Tong to Shanghai. Yin, suffering severely from rheumatism, decided to send a representative to meet with Huang to discuss matters. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu has recently expressed passivity due to difficulties in handling affairs. After Chairman Chiang and President Wang retained him in Ganzhou, it is hoped that he will withdraw his resignation. Huang, needing to return to his ancestral hometown to sweep tombs, took a car to Xun at 7 a.m. on the 14th with his secretary He Jiecai and attendants, arriving in Xun at 11 a.m. and immediately transferring to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangxin steamer heading east.

<h3 id="e22">Relief for Industrial Crisis <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— England</p>
<p>Reports indicate that various Chinese-owned cotton mills in this port city are facing sluggish sales due to Japanese cotton yarn encroachment. As a result, the stock of unsold yarn at the end of last month has increased compared to previous periods. It is said that a meeting will be convened on the 13th of this month to thoroughly discuss relief measures. Simultaneously, it is reported that silk factories in this port city, such as Hengfeng, collectively went on strike to support American-Asian workers after they petitioned and went on strike. Furthermore, it is rumored that the flour milling industry is also experiencing monthly losses amounting to several million yuan. From this, it can be observed that Shanghai, as the commercial and financial center of the entire nation, is experiencing such fragility in the foundation of its vital industrial sectors. Under the current heavy pressure of foreign capital and goods, coupled with the tense situation of Japanese encroachment in northern China, a single thread can affect the whole body. This will inevitably deeply and severely endanger our production markets and impact the commercial and financial sectors of southeastern regions. It also has a direct bearing on the safety and well-being of the country and society, and therefore cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The arrival of fortune or misfortune does not occur on the day fortune or misfortune happens but is always due to a preceding cause. This is true for all things, and the outbreak of an industrial crisis cannot escape this general principle. The development of our nation's industries began several decades ago. The silk industry has an even longer history than the cotton yarn industry. However, it has been ravaged internally by feudal warlords and incessant civil wars and externally by the destruction of imperialism and the invasion of goods and capital through a two-pronged approach. Some Chinese people are deluded by the concept of international investment and ultimately fail to resolve the crisis of foreigners directly operating and establishing companies. Consequently, they become secondary to the foreigners. All industries and finance are subjected to the invasion of foreign forces, perpetually trapped in a state of neither life nor death. This is particularly deeply felt by the cotton yarn, silk, and flour milling industries. Looking back from the present and contemplating the reasons for such weakness and the inability to recover, those within the industries, while still feeling the pain and seeking ways to alleviate it, should strive for self-reliance to overcome today's numerous difficulties. We believe that this requires a fundamental approach without hesitation.</p>
<p>However, there is more than one way to rescue a crisis. The key lies in thoroughly investigating the source of the problem. If the source is not treated, merely focusing on trivial matters will not alleviate the current difficulties. Considering the current state of industries, some advocate reducing labor costs or halting some production facilities to clear inventory as a relief plan. This may be sufficient to alleviate immediate needs for a particular industry. However, from a societal perspective, there is no possibility of progress in the overall situation. Moreover, the forces hindering our industrial expansion are still thriving and unaffected in the slightest. Secondly, some advocate using financial power to rescue the industrial crisis. It is undeniable that in the past several decades, our nation's finance has failed to fulfill its mission of supporting industry. In recent years, the atmosphere has slightly changed, and people are gradually becoming aware. However, little strength remains, leading to a situation where both industry and finance are suffering. Therefore, if one wishes to use the power of financial organizations today to achieve the effect of developing industry, it requires a radical plan to rebuild from scratch. Otherwise, it will only lead industry and finance to be further interfered with and oppressed by foreign forces. Therefore, we believe that implementing this strategy under the current situation is akin to seeking treatment for an illness but instead accelerating its progression. Based on the above, both cost reduction and finance are not fundamental solutions for today's industrial crisis relief. Therefore, if one wants to seek a fundamental solution for industry today, is there any other strategy besides the nation unanimously focusing on shaking off foreign forces and clarifying domestic politics? The Chinese people should know where to find the root cause.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The meeting of the three top officials, Minister of the Army Hayashi, Chief of the General Staff Imperial Prince Kan'in, and Director-General of Military Education Mazaki, commenced at 1:00 PM today. As a result of vigorous persuasion, Minister of the Army Hayashi decided to withdraw his resignation and the meeting adjourned at 1:40 PM. Minister of the Army Hayashi immediately met with Prime Minister Saitō at 2:30 PM to report on the aforementioned situation and request understanding. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government attaches great importance to the issue of Minister of the Army Hayashi's resignation, fearing that it would affect the political situation. Now, as a result of the meeting of the three top officials, Minister of the Army Hayashi has decided to withdraw his resignation, and the political situation is gradually stabilizing. Therefore, the government will also strive to advance the important policies that have been decided to achieve a bright future. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 9:20 AM on the 15th, Director-General of Military Education Mazaki visited Imperial Prince Kan'in to inquire about the details regarding Minister of the Army Hayashi's request for resignation. The Director-General explained the situation, analyzed his own opinions and the intentions of the military in detail, and explained the meeting with the Minister of the Army this morning and the Minister of the Army's current state of mind. Imperial Prince Kan'in earnestly requested Director-General Mazaki to convey to the Minister of the Army the desire to withdraw his resignation. The Director-General then left the official residence at 9:45 AM and went to the Minister of the Army's official residence to report on the aforementioned situation, request the withdrawal of the resignation, and discuss various matters. (China United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the outbreak of Minister of the Army Hayashi's resignation issue, Chief of the General Staff Imperial Prince Kan'in changed his itinerary and rushed back to Tokyo, arriving at Tokyo Station at 9:20 PM on the 14th. He immediately returned to his residence and summoned Minister of the Army Hayashi for a meeting. Minister of the Army Hayashi entered the residence at 9:45 PM and stated that because his younger brother, Shirakami Sakichi, had been convicted, and at a time when the issue of discipline was serious, he wished to set an example and had submitted a letter of resignation. He felt sorry that this case had occurred while His Highness the Chief of Staff was traveling, causing him to change his planned itinerary. Imperial Prince Kan'in immediately offered words of comfort, and the Minister of the Army left the palace at 10:25 PM. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saitō is scheduled to enter the Imperial Palace on the 16th to meet with the Emperor and report in detail on the process by which Minister of the Army Hayashi submitted a letter of resignation due to being implicated himself, but was fortunate to have been unanimously persuaded to stay by the army and decided to withdraw his resignation. After answering questions, he will withdraw and return the retained letter of resignation to Minister of the Army Hayashi. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Viewed from the current political situation, Minister of the Army Hayashi's withdrawal of his resignation is quite appropriate, and all parties have expressed goodwill. The opinions of various parties are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>House of Peers: The Minister of the Army's decision to remain in office is due to the efforts of Chief of the General Staff Imperial Prince Kan'in and the entire army, which is truly a good thing. The Minister of the Army's firm will could not be carried out due to the complex situation within the army, making it difficult to assess successors, which can be imagined. Therefore, the Minister of the Army's internal relations seem to require even more effort. The resolution of this issue will require a considerable amount of time. However, since the problem within the army has been resolved, it should not directly affect the political situation.</p>
<p>Seiyūkai: It seems difficult to retain Minister of the Army Hayashi given his personality. However, due to the sincere persuasion of the Chief of Staff and the sincere persuasion of the entire army during the meeting of the three top officials, Minister of the Army Hayashi had no choice but to change his firm decision. Although Minister of the Army Hayashi could not carry out his original intention, given the current national conditions of Japan, it is believed that a loyal figure as the Minister of the Army, as the leader of the army, should adjust the military and ease the feelings between the military and the people in order to smooth the national administration. Therefore, the Minister of the Army's remaining in office is a welcome event for the country and for constitutional government. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>

It is heard that Sweden has sent a memorandum to the League of Nations, urging the speedy holding of the Disarmament Conference and the conclusion of a treaty. The treaty limits certain armaments, and concrete solutions are left for later. Naval disarmament will be discussed next year. It is also heard that the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland have all endorsed the proposals in the Swedish memorandum, which will be considered by the main leadership meeting of the next Disarmament Conference.

To establish an agreement to limit the armaments of various countries, and at the same time not to establish another agreement to sanction countries that sign the agreement but do not abide by it and increase their armaments beyond the limits set by the agreement, this is an extremely difficult problem to resolve. However, I believe that there is still hope of reaching an agreement on this matter. However, given the current situation in Europe, there are still various major difficulties.

<p>(London) Lord Rothermere spoke to journalists in London today, discussing the relationship between Britain and France in the disarmament issue, the Treaty of Trianon, and the return of German colonies. Lord Rothermere said that given the current state of negotiations on the disarmament issue, the completion of maintaining the balance of power in Europe depends on the understanding between Britain and France. However, this understanding is not a united front against Germany. The Treaty of Versailles is the most unfair and evil act. The only way to remedy it is to return all of Germany's former colonies. The Treaty of Versailles stated that Germany was incapable of governing its colonies, and it is now known that this statement is untrue. Therefore, regardless of the position, this issue cannot be examined in detail. No one can doubt that Germany cannot possess colonies. Finally, Lord Rothermere stated that he supports the fascist movement in Britain because he believes that this movement is conducive to the revival of British parliamentarianism.

<h3 id="e34">German Commercial Policy: Planning to Abandon Economic Self-Sufficiency; Control Import Trade <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Hamburg German Foreign Minister Neurath announced Germany's future foreign trade relations and Germany's new commercial policy in a speech at an annual meeting banquet of a certain society tonight. According to the Foreign Minister, Germany's goal in the future is to restore the prosperity of the German ports of Hamburg and Bremen. These ports, due to their convenient geographical location, were previously centers for foreign commodity trade, but since the Great War, incidents have occurred repeatedly, and their commercial status has plummeted. The future of German commerce will be based on the following two points: ㈠ Abandoning the policy of economic self-sufficiency. I believe that no one in the German government dares to believe that the German economy should be isolated from foreign countries in order to survive. United efforts will make our nation and our economic system healthier day by day. Abandoning the previous reliance on foreign food and raw materials for self-reliance, significant progress has been made, especially in Germany's ability to be self-sufficient in food. Furthermore, given Germany's position in Central Europe, it is even more necessary to have close commercial relations with neighboring countries, especially the need to import raw materials, and it is urgent to establish friendly relations with neighboring countries. As for the second point, import trade will be more controlled in the future. Germany has to adjust import and export trade due to the impact of currency devaluation in various countries. Germany also purchases raw materials from those who buy refined products from Germany. Therefore, trade will be generally controlled by the government in the future, and individuals will not be allowed to make decisions on commercial policy freely. To achieve this new commercial policy, it depends on the stability of the international political situation. However, Germany is confident that it stands on the side of justice and will be able to achieve this goal. (National News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Today, President Lebrun signed five new delegated legislative orders, stipulating measures for veterans to cooperate with the government and voluntarily reduce the receipt of benefits. Prime Minister Doumergue submitted a report stating that the budget deficit totaled 4,000,000,000 francs. The government issued 14 delegated legislative orders on the 4th of this month, which saved 2,800,000,000 francs. The five new ordinances issued today will save another 1,200,000,000 francs. The two orders have fully compensated for the budget deficit. According to the 14 orders on the 4th of this month, which canceled concurrent positions and reduced civil servants' salaries, the five new ordinances signed today ㈠ Prevent fraud, ㈡ Revise the amount of alimony for veterans' families, ㈢ Reformulate the method of free medical treatment for veterans, ㈣ Revise the amount of veterans' pensions, ㈤ Veterans voluntarily reduce various benefits by 3%. Overall, the measures to reduce government spending are of great importance. After the financial rectification, not only will the budget be restored to balance, not only will the currency be stabilized from then on, but the people of the whole country will work together to reduce the standard of living. In the short term, the general deflationary situation can also be seen in reality. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt decided today to urge both houses of Congress to pass at least six major bills during this session. This decision was made after a three-hour meeting between the President and Senate leaders at the White House this afternoon. During the White House meeting, various bills already submitted to Congress were reviewed. According to the White House, the President hopes that Congress will vote on the following bills: (1) currency issues, (2) reciprocal tariffs, (3) tax revenue, (4) Federal Deposit Insurance, (5) municipal bankruptcy, and (6) Securities Exchange Control Act. The White House statement did not elaborate on currency issues, but according to the Associated Press, the government has not specifically designated any particular bill, but hopes that the Steagall Bill will be passed to address the financial situation. Furthermore, some sources interpret that the government hopes to pass a moderate silver bill to quell the opposition of the silver bloc. However, the proposed silver coinage bill is not expected to pass. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has consulted with Democratic leaders regarding the adjournment of Congress. Although the President is eager for Congress to adjourn early, there are certain issues that he considers to be of primary importance and he wishes Congress to decide on them as soon as possible. These primary issues are: (1) legislation authorizing the President to enter into tariff agreements with other countries based on reciprocal principles; (2) tax legislation; (3) legislation regulating securities exchanges; (4) currency legislation and legislation regarding the supervision of transportation industries. Among these bills, the President pays the most attention to the bill to obtain full power to conduct business negotiations. Roosevelt is extremely eager for this bill to be passed before the end of the Congressional session. It is also heard that among the currency bills there is a clause related to the silver issue, but according to senators and the press, the bill related to the silver issue proposed by the government is far from meeting the hopes of the pro-silver price increase faction in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The revenue portion of the appropriations bill, which was passed by the Senate yesterday, had an amendment attached that would increase revenue by $480,000,000. This amendment stipulates a three percent tax on Philippine coconut oil, which the President opposes and intends to veto to prevent. The leaders of the House of Representatives will meet with the President tomorrow to comprehensively discuss the bills that Congress has not yet completed, just as the Senate leaders did yesterday. Although these meetings are considering the procedures for the work before the adjournment of Congress, the date of the Congressional recess has not yet been determined, and even the approximate date has not been discussed.

The resolution stipulates the issuance of paper money to clear farm mortgages. According to reliable information obtained by the Associated Press this morning, the petition has now been signed by 131 members, and fourteen more are needed to satisfy the statutory number to force a vote on the bill. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Republican Senator Goldsborough, and in the House by Representative Renneck. The bill stipulates that government bonds representing agricultural products shall be the guarantee for the issuance of this paper money. According to some currency inflationists, the purpose of distributing the petition is to counter the obstruction of the bill by the hard-money faction. (National News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Police searched the Barbezon villa near Fontainebleau yesterday and discovered that Trotsky, the leader of the Soviet Russian extremist party, was hiding there. There were six people living with him, and their movements were mysterious. Only two people went out, while the others remained in seclusion. Every day, someone on a motorcycle came to the villa to deliver letters. One day, the motorcycle broke down halfway, and the police came forward to question him. The person was unwilling to reveal his name, so the police followed him and discovered that Trotsky was living there, holding a passport issued in 1933, with no irregularities. The prosecutor believes that there is no need for further investigation. Trotsky claimed that he was hiding here for fear of retaliation from the White Russians. When the police entered the villa to investigate, they saw Trotsky sitting at a desk on the top floor, with two very large pistols placed on the desk. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Bucharest: Officers from Outer Transylvania secretly plotted to assassinate King Carol of Romania and kidnap his girlfriend, Madame Lupescu. They rented a house to live in at a location along the route that the King would take to attend Easter services at the church. The house was situated high, offering a distant view of everything. A servant of one of the officers was packing his luggage, placing several bombs in a leather suitcase. The servant was initially unaware of the plot, but later chatted with a soldier he knew, saying that his master's behavior was strange and that the leather suitcase was filled with heavy objects. This news was subsequently passed on to senior officials, who sent personnel to search the officer's room, where they discovered the bombs. Subsequently, ten other officers were arrested, including Colonel Puiu Ricioiu, who had previously welcomed King Carol back to the country to restore him to the throne. They are now all charged with treason. Although the case has been discovered, it is feared that other events are still brewing in Bucharest. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>St. Louis: A young woman here suddenly suffered an acute illness, and her functions were almost completely lost. She became deaf, mute, and blind at the same time, lasting for six days. Her relatives and friends put her on an airplane and took her to the hospital in Lambert Field. While the young woman was unconscious, she vaguely felt as if the plane was falling from a height of 2,000 feet. Unexpectedly, just five minutes after the plane landed, the young woman's senses were fully restored, and she laughed and talked like a normal person. Everyone was amazed. The young woman, Mrs. Fowgyn, is 28 years old. When Mrs. Fowgyn was ill, her husband hired many neurology specialists to treat her, but to no avail. Later, she heard someone say that flying downhill in an airplane could cure the disease, so she tried it, and it worked miraculously. Mrs. Fowgyn had never been on an airplane before, and the airline initially refused to take sick people on board. Later, the company manager, Mr. Robertson, rode with her. According to Mr. Robertson, when the plane took off, the sick woman went into a coma. Afterwards, Mrs. Fowgyn told people that she would never hesitate to fly on an airplane again, and would first try riding in an elevator. Mrs. Fowgyn's illness was caused by a fall she had several years ago. (National News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Germany previously promulgated a eugenics law prohibiting marriage for those who are physically weak, have committed crimes, or have mental illnesses, so that bad genes can be cut off from now on, and the healthy race will become stronger. After the order was issued, the whole country followed. Now, in order to make the implementation of this order more strictly supervised, a special education is being given to doctors and judges across the country. The German Medical Journal contains an article by Professor Grober, advocating the establishment of special chairs in eugenics at universities. Doctors, pastors, judges, teachers, etc., must attend lectures. According to the Leipzig Daily News, the Saxon state government firmly believes that the Nordic peoples are uniquely endowed by nature, and in terms of the value of the soul and body given by the Creator, the composition of the Nordic peoples is an "excellent component." Therefore, it intends to establish a special research institute on ethnology and national health in the city of Dresden. The mission of the academy is to assist the National Socialist government in completing one of its main tasks, namely, to maintain, cultivate, and increase this spiritually vigorous and physically strong nation, and pass it on from generation to generation without end.

<h3 id="e72">Overview of Construction in Chahar Province <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou, located at the southern station of the Chahar Railway, was changed to Chahar Province in the 17th year of the Republic of China. The provincial capital was established here, and the county name was changed to Wanquan. The city is divided into four districts: Shangbao, Xiabao, Kouwai (outside the pass), and the commercial port. Kouwai is inhabited by Mongolian merchants and a small number of Russians, while the rest are Han Chinese merchants. The city covers an area of ​​four li from east to west and more than ten li from north to south, with a population of approximately 120,000. It connects to Outer Mongolia in the north, entering Siberia; it passes through Duolun to the east, entering the four eastern provinces; and it heads west to Sui, Ning, and Xinjiang. It is a major gateway between the interior and the border regions. With Outer Mongolia's independence and the loss of the four provinces, followed by the crisis surrounding Duolun and Zhangjiakou, it is feared that according to Japan's Tanaka Doctrine, after the four eastern provinces fall into their control, eastern Inner Mongolia like Chahar, and western Inner Mongolia like Suiyuan, will also be regarded as delicacies to be seized. This goes without saying. Recently, the Japanese 80th Division in Rehe was transferred back to Japan, replaced by the 70th Division. There are reports that the command headquarters will be located in Duolun. In addition to the Zhang (jiakou) - Duo (lun) highway, the Japanese and puppet forces are also repairing the Duo (lun) - Gu (yuan) road, and have built airfields and stockpiled food in key locations. In recent days, Japanese suddenly came to Zhangjiakou to establish a Japanese-Chinese foreign firm, but its intentions are unknown. The next day, I visited Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, and Qin Dechun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and briefly discussed the political situation in Chahar Province as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e73">Qin Dechun on the Left, Song Zheyuan on the Left <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>After the end of the war in North China, Song was transferred to govern Chahar. The first step was to reorganize the mixed-brigade troops stationed there. He immediately followed the central government's order to reorganize and reorganize the various units of Tang Yulin, Huang Shouzhong, Li Zhongyi, etc., totaling about 200,000 men. He completely relieved the burden of local food supplies, dispatching firewood, and other responsibilities from the people, in order to appease the people and stabilize the region. The second step was to reassure the officials and people of Chahar. Any official found to be corrupt, as well as chiefs of public security bureaus, district chiefs, etc., engaging in interference in government matters or illegal acts, will be severely punished immediately upon discovery. Currently, a certain public security bureau chief is still in custody. He is also striving to eliminate excessive taxes and benefit the people. In terms of public security, the ten counties of Xuanhua are peaceful and tranquil. The five counties of Zhangbei (Duolun and Guyuan, where two to four districts have already been occupied by Japanese and puppet troops) have slight bandit activity. Zhao, the division commander of the 32nd Division, is determined to completely eliminate the bandits within two weeks. Sun Dianying's remnant troops, led by Yang Xiaohouzi, are attempting to flee eastward from the Suiyuan-Ningxia border, and precautions are being taken to intercept them. It is still easy to manage. If unfortunately there are border police or foreign troubles, it is his duty to follow the instructions of the central government and properly deal with them. The entire Chahar Province has a total of sixteen counties (including Duolun). The six counties outside the pass are high plateaus, flat and convenient for transportation. The ten counties inside the pass are full of mountains and rugged roads. Transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, industry, mining, and land reclamation all urgently need development. Li Yishan, the section chief of the Construction Department, gave a very detailed account of the construction situation since the establishment of the Construction Department. The following is a brief record:</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, the completed highways include the Zhang (jiakou) - Ku (lun) Road, Zhang Bai (lingmiao) Road, Zhang Duo (lun) Road, Zhang Bei (zimiao) Road, and Zhang Ping (Beiping) Road. The Zhang-Ping Road has no freight transport due to the impact of the Ping-Sui Railway. The Zhang-Ku and Zhang-Duo roads have been closed since the incidents in Kulun and Duolun. There are seven telephone lines: Zhang-Bin (chang), Xuan (hua)-Yan (qing), Zhang-Gu (yuan), Zhang-Chai (goubao), Xi (malin)-Huai (an), Xuan-Yang (yuan), Xia (huayuan)-Wei (xian).</p>
<p>In terms of water conservancy, Chahar Province is located in the northern frontier, with undulating barren mountains and little rainfall. It is urgent to find ways to dig canals and wells to supplement the lack of rainfall. Only Huailai, Wanquan, and Zhuolu counties in the entire province occasionally open canals to draw water to irrigate farmland. Recently, the canal at the border between Wan and Huai counties has been completed. The rest are lacking in both natural resources and manpower. Song advocated for the construction of wells. The Construction Department purchased well-drilling machines and distributed them to various counties for drilling. However, due to the geological composition of phosphate rock, no results were achieved. Seventeen new wells were drilled in Huailai, with water levels as low as tens or even twenty feet. Extraction is quite difficult, but for the sake of irrigation, it is still necessary to continue drilling.</p>
<p>In terms of agriculture, Chahar Province is located adjacent to the Mongolian plateau, with sandy soil and a climate of drought and little rain in spring and summer, and wind and snow in autumn and winter. Agricultural development is most difficult. Especially in the outer pass, cultivation is purely naturalistic. After planting, it is left to grow on its own, with no attention paid to cultivation and protection. The harvest is always less than in the inner pass. Currently, the provincial agricultural and forestry experimental farm is being reorganized and expanded, and plans are being made to carry out agricultural extension work, improve seeds, fertilizers, soil, etc. The counties are instructed to establish seed exchange stations and hold agricultural product review meetings in stages to study methods of preventing and treating diseases and insect pests.</p>
<p>In terms of forestry, the natural forests of Chahar Province have been completely harvested in recent decades. Moreover, due to poor climate and soil, it is difficult for trees to survive when planted. No attention has been paid to afforestation in the past, resulting in bare mountains and desolate landscapes. Now, all localities have been instructed to plant a tree per person, replant in autumn if it dies in spring, and pay attention to protection. According to statistics, the average number of trees planted and survived in each county in the past two years is approximately one million. In the future, the province's sixteen counties will be divided into three forest areas according to their terrain, and dozens of county and district nurseries will be expanded.</p>
<p>In terms of land reclamation, the wasteland outside Chahar Province, from the time when Yigu, the Minister of Land Reclamation in the late Qing Dynasty, released land for reclamation, to the time when the Land Reclamation General Bureau was abolished in the 16th year of the Republic of China, has almost completely surveyed and released the large tracts of virgin land of the Eight Banners and ordinary wasteland. At that time, people had already contracted to receive wasteland, paid the price according to the grade, and were issued certificates, and the property rights began to be determined. Other uncultivated wasteland will be surveyed and released separately after the investigation is clear, in order to develop land and benefit the people.</p>
<p>In terms of animal husbandry, the six counties outside Chahar Province and various parts of the Xilin Gol League have a sparse population and vast land, with abundant water and grass, making it a natural and prosperous area for animal husbandry. In the most prosperous era of animal husbandry in the former Qing Dynasty, the annual output was more than 5 million sheep and more than 400,000 famous horses. Even the number of sheep raised in each county within the pass averaged 20,000 to 30,000.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Grandeur of the Qinghe Bridge in Zhangjiakou <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>or more. In recent years, the local area has been unstable, and soldiers and bandits have been frequent, affecting animal husbandry, which has been declining day by day. The Provincial First Livestock Farm has now been established in Zhangbei County to raise high-quality breeding livestock, breed them according to law, and prepare for promotion and improvement.</p>
<p>In terms of mining, coal mines in Xuanhua, Weixian, Huailai, Zhangbei and other four counties have the most abundant output, followed by Huai'an and Guyuan. According to surveys and statistics, the area of coal mining areas in the province is approximately 135,350 hectares. Iron ore is also abundant in Xuanhua, Longguan and other counties, but it has not been formally mined. The same is true for sulfur mines. Methods of improvement: 1) Establish a mining consultation office; 2) Investigate mineral products; 3) Promote new methods of mining; 4) Develop major mineral deposits.</p>
<p>In terms of industry, the industry in Chahar Province is immature. Although the raw materials produced are extremely abundant, it is a pity that they cannot be used. In the past, there were only rough handmade products such as felt blankets and felt hats. Only two small factories that have been registered are the Xuanhua Yumin Egg Beating Factory and the Weixian Xinmin Weaving Factory. The Construction Department has now instructed various counties to establish people's livelihood factories, separately promote family handicrafts, encourage the holding of exhibitions, and reward specialized technical talents. In terms of commerce, because the province borders Mongolia, commerce tends to focus on trade with Mongolians. The main imports and sales to various places are fur, mushrooms, and crystal. The main exports and sales to Mongolia are interior vegetables, cloth, and groceries. During the period when Zhangjiakou and Duolun were open to commerce, commerce was extremely prosperous for a time. After Kulun became independent and transportation was blocked, commerce fell into a slump. After the anti-Japanese military operations last year, Duolun fell and the Zhangjiakou-Duolun road was also blocked again, and commerce suffered another major blow. As a result, all industries were in decline and increasingly depressed. In the future, if we want to revitalize and restore, we should first reorganize transportation, appease Mongolians, and broaden our recruitment. Secondly, we should repair the streets and markets in the provincial capital, promote the new system of weights and measures in various places, and promote domestic goods. Only then can the future of commerce be hopeful.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Old Nest of the Fang Bandits, Zhoufang, Has Been Recovered; the Army Will Advance to Destroy Hengfeng and Geyuan <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch. Zhoufang, located in the northern part of Guixi County in northeastern Jiangxi, is intertwined with Yujiang and Wannian counties. To the north, it can connect to Leping and Dexing, and to the east, it can enter Yiyang and Hengfeng. It is an important old nest of the Fang Zhimin bandit gang south of the Rao River and north of the Xin River, no less important than the former Moban Mountain and the current Hengfeng and Geyuan. However, due to the complex terrain and deep bandit influence, although it has been besieged and suppressed by the stationed troops in recent years, it has been regained and lost in quick succession, with soldiers and bandits alternating, forming a tug-of-war. Since Chen Tiaoyuan, Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Army of the Five Provinces' Bandit Suppression Army, was stationed in Wuyuan and unified the command of the stationed troops on the borders of eastern Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian, generals such as Zhao Guantao, Yu Jishi, Tang Huiyuan, and Liang Lizhu have all been placed under Chen's command. They were divided into four sides, east, west, north, and south, to encircle and suppress the Fang bandits. According to front-line news, Zhoufang, the origin of the pseudo-10th Army, has been completely recovered after troops stationed in Guixi, Yujiang, Wannian, Leping, and Yiyang counties were divided into multiple routes to encircle and suppress the bandits and defeated the Yu-Gui pseudo-independent regiment and other bandits. Zhou, the magistrate of Guixi, has rushed to Zhoufang with the army to build bunkers, gather refugees, provide disaster relief, and restore order in order to seek follow-up measures. Moreover, Hengfeng City is currently the base of the Fang bandits, and the headquarters of the pseudo-Jiangxi-Zhejiang Provincial Government and the pseudo-10th Army Corps are located here. The pseudo-Red Army schools and arsenals are located in the Geyuan area of the county. Chen Tiaoyuan is also making all arrangements and commanding the army to advance to destroy them, in order to quell the bandit scourge as soon as possible. (April 12)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Bandit News from Sichuan, Henan, and Hubei; Chiang Instructs Liu Xiang to Settle the Sichuan Situation Early; Henan and Hubei Border Defense Against Sichuan Bandits; Wang Ma's Remnant Bandits Flee to Southern Henan; Chen Jicheng Reports Victory by Telegraph <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch. After the main force of the Sichuan bandits retreated to Tongjiang, the focus of the Sichuan bandit suppression military affairs has shifted here. However, there are still a few remnant bandits in the Nanjiang area, and both sides of the Ba River have not been completely cleared. The advancing armies are still inevitably somewhat constrained. Chiang Kai-shek recently sent a special telegram to Liu Xiang in Sichuan Province, instructing him to clear the remaining bandits and settle the Sichuan situation early. The telegram stated in brief: "After the recovery of Bazhong, most of the bandits retreated to Tongjiang, and a small part retreated to Nanjiang. The Li and Luo units are now guarding the key points in front of Bazhong. For the sake of annihilating them in victory, in addition to telegraphing to advance along the Nanjiang, and to clear both banks of the Ba River on the fourth road, and to encircle Tongjiang, I hope that you will urge the armies of all roads to settle the Sichuan situation early, so as to relieve the central government's concern about the west. " As for the way out for the Sichuan bandits, according to various sources, they will definitely flee to the borders of Shaanxi and Hubei. Once they cross the Bashan Mountains, they will be in Shaanxi. Northern Hubei is also adjacent to it, with deep mountains and dense forests, which are more self-sufficient than the counties in northern Sichuan. Chiang Kai-shek believes that transportation on the borders of Shaanxi, Hubei, and Henan is inconvenient, and military transport is difficult. Once there is an emergency, it will not be easy to dispatch troops. He has specially ordered that the border area highways be completed by the end of April. This transportation network starts from Junyun in Hubei, Tongbai in Henan, and Baihe in Shaanxi, and they are interconnected with each other and connected with the original highways in each province. Currently, the section from the county to Laohekou has begun to be open to traffic, and only the sections from Yunyang to Caodian and Shiyan to Baihe have not been completed and are being rushed to build.</p>
<p>He Chengjun recently went to Fancheng again within three days to sit in town. The original stationed troops in northern Hubei included the 41st Division of Zhang Zhenhan, the 50th Division of Fan Shisheng, and the 34th Independent Brigade of Luo Qijiang. The 82nd Division of Rong Jingfang has also recently followed orders to go there. Since the military strength on that side is thick, the defense will be more consolidated. The remnant forces of Wang You and Ma Xiyou in Henan were besieged and suppressed by various armies, sometimes together and sometimes separately. First, Wang's bandits were defeated by Zhang Fang's troops in Queshan. Ma's bandits traveled from Shangnan in Shaanxi, through Junxian Nanhua, Lijiaqiao, and Houpo in northern Hubei, and Heilongji in Xiangyang, to Tangxian in Henan, and joined Wang's bandits, fleeing to Xindian and Liudian, crossing Yexian and reaching Feng, deep into the hinterland of Henan. After being besieged and suppressed by Zhang Fang, Pang Bingxun and other troops, they split up and fled south. Wang's bandits suffered the heaviest damage and are now besieged in Dushu Town, Fangcheng. Ma's bandits fled from Dengxian into Hubei. Luo Qijiang led his troops from Zaoyang on the 13th to attack together, and joined friendly troops Tang Yang and other regiments, and engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits at Suiyangdian. The bandits fled to Wangjiacheng, and there was a tendency to flee along the Tongbai Mountains to Zhongxiang. Luo has sent troops to track them down and has telegraphed the garrison in Zhongxiang to prevent them.</p>
<p>The remnant bandits in southern Hubei previously harassed Ruichang, and Wuxue on the opposite bank was once threatened by them. After being defeated by the 3rd Column of the Western Route Army, Chen Jicheng telegraphed Hankou twice on the 14th to report victory. 1) The remnant troops of Gao's bandits sneaked to the Lijia Dam area of ​​Mainan on the 8th, with about a thousand people and only a few hundred guns, and came into contact with my Guo (Rudong) Division. The bandits initially resisted stubbornly. Later, my Li Zongjian Brigade joined the flanking attack from the right wing. Countless bandits were killed in this battle. On the 10th and 11th, the bandits came to harass again, so we met them with three-sided counterattacks, killing countless bandits and capturing more than 30 people, including Yuan Zhongda, the director of the pseudo-political department, and Yao Shunxun, the captain of the special service company. The remnant bandits fled to the Jiangxi border. In addition to telegraphed local garrisons and Qingxian volunteers to block them, I respectfully report. 2) As for the bandits who harassed Ruichang, since Deputy Commander Guo Rudong personally supervised his troops, as well as Liu Peixu's Brigade, Li Zongjian's Brigade, and Zhang Liansan's Brigade, after annihilating the pseudo-Red 7th and 8th Regiments, the pseudo-47th Regiment, the pseudo-3rd Division, the pseudo-9th Regiment, and the pseudo-Special Service Battalion were extremely embarrassed and fled in all directions. On the morning of the 12th, the 154th Regiment of Guo's troops pursued from Mailiyuan to Zoujiacun, and engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits at Maicaoyan for four hours, completely defeating the bandits, leaving more than a hundred corpses behind and wounding hundreds more. They also killed Wang Taibang, the battalion commander of the pseudo-Longhu Special Service Battalion, whose pseudo-status was still on the body, captured more than 70 people, and seized more than 100 guns. The bandits were cut into two sections. The pseudo-3rd Division, the 47th Regiment, and the remnants of the pseudo-8th Regiment fled to Huangqiao, while the pseudo-9th Regiment and the pseudo-Special Service Battalion hid in Qijiaji. At the same time, Deputy Commander Guo led the 153rd Regiment and the engineering battalion to Qijiatan in Qingling to intercept them, and captured more than 40 bandits, killing countless people, and seized more than a dozen Mauser pistols and more than 20 rifles. Our company commander Wang was injured. The bandits fled to Cao, and were intercepted by Li Zongjian's Brigade from Quanyan, and fled to Daijiabu in embarrassment. Deputy Commander Guo is still supervising the troops to suppress them in order to completely clear them. Chen Jicheng, the original Administrative Commissioner of the Second District, has been relieved of his post because he cannot take care of both bandit suppression. He has telegraphed Chiang to approve it, and Li Huiwu has been appointed to succeed him. The Special Commissioner's Office has been moved to Yangxin, and Chen Yasheng has also been appointed as the Director of the Daban Special Zone Political Bureau, and the organization will be established next week.

<h3 id="e78">Liu Guitang's Bandits Fled Northward from Changcheng, Dare Not Stay in Wulian Mountain for Long, and Plan to Go to the Seaport but Fear Interception <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch. Liu Guitang's remnant bandits have been fleeing from Henan to Shandong for nearly a month, and have suffered heavy blows and losses. On the 11th night, the bandits sneaked to Chaohe in Zhucheng and fled westward across the river overnight, passing through Dongshangpo, Zaogezhuang, Doutou, Jiajiazhuang, Xinzhuang, Wangjiazhuang, to Laojuntang. To the north of this place is Wulian Mountain, a deep valley with dangerous peaks and cliffs. There are several caves in the mountain that can be used as a refuge. On the 12th, the central government's aircraft flew from Xuzhou to Ju County, refueled, and then flew to the area occupied by the bandits to drop bombs and bombard them. Whether the bandits have entered the mountains or not is still unreported by the aircraft. The street district chief of Rizhao County reported that, according to refugees who escaped from Sanguan, Liu's bandits once sneaked from Wulian Mountain to Sanguan, and then returned to Wulian Mountain. This place is on the border of Zhucheng, 50 li away from Rizhao. Tang Bangzhi and Ma Guanyi's brigades have arrived in Rizhao by car from Ju County and are deployed in the south to block the bandits. Li Xuande's cavalry regiment and Wu Yuanxing's regiment are chasing behind the bandits. Gu Liangmin was stationed in Linyi, and Zhan Shutang previously led his Yun Qichang Brigade to Hongshiya to block them. Now that Liu's bandits have entered Wulian Mountain, Zhan led his pistol team to Jinan by car from Gaomi on the afternoon of the 12th, and Yun's brigade also returned one after another.</p>
<p>Wulian Mountain is a famous scenic spot in Zhucheng. The mountains are steep and dangerous, with cliffs and precipices everywhere. Only one road can pass through the middle. There are many azaleas in the mountain. The beams of the Guangming Temple are all made of stone. There are 150 to 160 monks. Whenever they hear of bandits, they block the road with stones and have guns for defense. A few bandits dare not pass. Liu's bandits had previously sneaked into the area the year before last, so they are hiding there again this time. I wonder if the monks will resist the bandits again this time.</p>
<p>Also, Liu's bandits tried to flee around the Sanguan Wulian Mountain area on the 12th. The 29th Division's Li Xiangchen Brigade was ambushed there and intercepted them. The bandits were caught off guard and fled in confusion. Gao Lantian's regiment also rushed to join the fierce pursuit, killing more than 50 bandits, capturing more than 40 alive, and seizing more than 20 miscellaneous guns and more than 20 mules and horses. The bandits did not dare to stay in Wulian Mountain for long and fled eastward, passing through Weijiagou and Liujia Chahe, in the mountains of Luan, and passing through Yangjiaogou, Liujiagou, and Majiazhuang. At 3 pm, Xu Wenyao, the deputy division commander of the 29th Division, led his troops to intercept them, seizing a bandit machine gun (Maxim), more than 100 rounds of ammunition, and killing more than 20 bandits. The bandits continued to flee southeast, passing through Pihuwowo, Xiaogaomazhuang, Ale, and Sanlizhuang, and sneaked to Shengshui, 20 li east of Majiazhuang, at night. They originally planned to continue sneaking to the seaport (the area is only a few dozen li away from Ju Kou), but because four warships of the Third Fleet were blocking the Shijiusuo Ju Kou, and the army was about to arrive, they did not dare to approach the seaport. At 1 pm on the 13th, they fled north from Shengshui, passing through Shizilu, Da Shangzhuang, Xiao Shangzhuang, Furong Village, Da Liangmazhuang, Zhituowo, Durugou, Shangyagou, Yaojiagou, Dongzhuang, Gao Machi, Douling, Migou, Nanling, Kuangsha Ridge, Wangjia Ridge, and Laozhuang, along the west bank of the Baichi River, to Changcheng, 25 li northeast of Zhucheng City. At 4 pm, according to aircraft reconnaissance reports, the bandits did not stay near Changcheng, but continued to flee to the northwest. (April 13)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Fuzhou Commercial Crisis: All Pawnshops Stop Issuing Tickets, Stores in the City Close One After Another, Finance Department Decides on Relief Measures <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch. The commerce of Fujian Province was extremely depressed last year. When the old lunar year ended and the accounts were closed, each store drew up an account to the pawnshop, and each pawnshop was unable to collect the goods from the loan, and was unable to return them. However, due to the excessive urging, they were afraid of causing a collapse of the account and turning into a disadvantage. They had to change the method and allow each store to change the owed account into a term note and extend it to the second day of the second lunar month of the old calendar this year to repay it. Now it has been overdue for a long time and the stores have not repaid it. Each pawnshop is in a bad market situation. Eighteen companies, including Tianquan, Yuanquan, Zifeng, Hengyi, Jiuhe, Quanyu, Henghe, Chongyu, Xinchun, Shengyu, Zichun, Tianji, Fuyu, and Longshen, unanimously decided to reduce the scope of the issuance of tickets, only engage in exchange, and no longer release money. Therefore, only paper money from the Central and China Banks is currently circulating in the market, and the silver market is extremely tight. The goods handled by the stores last year have all been sold out, and it is urgent to add new goods to Hong Kong and Shanghai, especially silk, Su Guang, Jingguo, and oil and grain, which are in urgent need of goods. Now, because the pawnshops are unwilling to lend money and there is no money to add goods, they have to open the door and sit and watch. However, the rent, salaries, electricity, and all expenses must be paid as usual, and they cannot be maintained. Stores are closing or going bankrupt one after another. Just taking South Main Street in the city as an example, since the first month of the lunar calendar, more than 30 stores have closed, with each store owing an average of about 10,000 yuan. In previous years, if you wanted to open a store on South Main Street, it was difficult to find a place without paying hundreds or thousands of yuan in moving fees. Now, there are empty houses, and the rent has been greatly reduced. Some have even been closed for more than half a year without anyone asking about them. The Fuzhou Chamber of Commerce, in view of the increasingly declining commercial situation, has not urgently raised relief measures. The entire city's commercial market will inevitably fall into a total bankruptcy situation. It has submitted a request to the provincial government to transfer 1 million yuan to the Executive Yuan for the Fuzhou Central Bank to use to relieve the Fuzhou market. Stores are allowed to borrow money from the bank with real estate, goods, or securities as collateral, so as to help the group. It has been many days since then, and no instructions have been received. The commercial market has entered a state of stagnation. Even the pawnshops, which have the closest relationship with the economy of the common people, have also proposed to stop pawnshops because the pawnshops have withdrawn the money and tickets and have no way to operate. (Now pawnshops do not accept items worth less than five yuan. Those worth five yuan can only be pawned for four or five corners.) Government taxes of all kinds have also been sharply reduced due to the commercial stagnation. For this reason, the Finance Department specially convened representatives of various banks and pawnshops on the 10th of this month to discuss relief measures and decided that the Central and China Banks would lend 500,000 yuan to the pawnshops, and the pawnshops would issue 1 million yuan in tickets, which would be used exclusively for circulating the market's finances. Stores are allowed to borrow money from the pawnshops with warehouse goods or bills of exchange as collateral for the purpose of adding goods. The detailed measures will be negotiated by the three parties of the bank, pawnshop, and chamber of commerce, and must be realized within a short period of time in order to relieve the commercial crisis.

<h3 id="e80">North China: The Decline of the Carpet Industry - Affected by Tariffs from Various Countries, Sales Sharply Decrease - More Than 500 Factories Now Only 80 Remain <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The North China carpet industry is a national private enterprise. Its products are sold overseas and enjoy a high reputation in Europe and the United States. During its peak in 1923, there were more than 600 factories in Tianjin and Hebei. The finished products were all wholesaled by European and American export companies. The annual trade volume reached a maximum of 20 million taels of silver. Taking Tianjin alone, more than 530 factories and over 30,000 workers were engaged in this industry. In recent years, due to increased tariffs in various countries and economic panic, carpets, being between decorations and luxury goods, have been subject to heavy taxes when sold to Europe and the United States. In the United States, the initial tax rate was 25%, later increased to 35%, and the year before last, it was changed to 55%. Last year, the tax was no longer based on the value of the goods but was levied at a rate of 55 taxes per foot, causing the sales of North China carpets to become precarious. Few Chinese people buy and transport this product; sales rely solely on Britain and the United States. In recent years, with the global economic panic, British and American people are also unable to afford them, and British and American machine-made products are also increasing daily, surpassing our North China products in beauty. Although the price is cheaper, and the sturdiness cannot match our Chinese handmade products, customers rarely discern this subtle point, and the sales of domestic carpets are also affected. Even in the domestic market, domestic products are not as popular as Western goods, mainly due to the high price of domestic goods. Recently, only more than 30 factories remain in Peiping and less than 90 in Tianjin. Among them, Qing Sheng Heng in Tianjin has relatively large capital. Three years ago, they had over a thousand workers. Since last year, due to business depression, they have reduced to 140-150 people. The total turnover for the year before last was more than 40,000 yuan, last year it was more than 100,000 yuan, and in the first half of this year, it was about 40,000 yuan, which is ten times less than the business income in the previous five years. Europeans and Americans used to order more than 10,000 feet at a time, but now they order at most 2,000-3,000 feet, and the price must be lowered. Now, the best carpets sold to the United States are about 1.8 yuan per foot. Because the US tariff is calculated by the foot, medium and low-grade goods cannot be shipped. The best goods sold to the UK are about 1.5 yuan, the medium grade is 1.2 yuan, and the lower grade is about 80-90 cents. At such low prices, factories can barely support themselves when business is booming. If there is a recession, they will suffer losses. Those that are not as large as Qing Heng have 20-30 workers. They first contact various foreign firms. If they have a buyer, they start work; otherwise, they stop, or the customer provides the raw materials and they undertake the manual work. Their income is sufficient to maintain operations. According to statistics, there are now less than 5,000 workers in this industry in Tianjin, several times less than in the past. Recently, the carpet industry association, seeing the industry in danger and on the verge of total collapse, has held repeated meetings to study rescue measures. However, this matter is not about the power of the national government. The tariff barriers of European and American countries have increased, restricting the import of our goods, and it cannot be effective unless diplomatic methods are used. Therefore, it is planned to jointly submit a petition to the government with the Shanghai Carpet Industry Association, requesting that the carpet be removed from the list of luxury goods. However, this matter involves a change in the tariff rate of a country, and it is feared that negotiations may not be effective. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Jiangsu Province Plans to Build the Tonghai Railway - Total Expenditure of More Than 70 Million Yuan, Shared by Government and Business - Construction to Begin in June This Year, Completion by the End of Next Year <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Qingjiangpu News: Last year, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and the National Economic Committee, etc., had planned to jointly invest in operating the Lianghuai Reclamation Zone to develop Jiangbei, but it was suspended due to lack of funds. Now, 12 people, including Rong Zongjing, a flour merchant, He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, and Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, have stepped forward to organize the Jiangbei Coastal Trust Group Farm, which has been specially approved by the central government to operate and invest in managing all farms, water conservancy projects, and all production undertakings along the coast of Jiangbei. They are now actively preparing, and it will soon be realized. Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, also regards Jiangbei as the source of wealth for the entire province. Last year, he formulated a three-year plan for developing Jiangbei based on the provincial treasury's capabilities and is now gradually promoting it. The primary issue for development is convenient transportation. It has been decided to raise funds to build the Tonghai Railway, which is expected to be completed in two years. The route starts from Nantong, passes through Dongtai, Rufou, Yancheng, Funing, Lianshui, Huaiyin, Suqian, Muyang, and Guanyun to reach Haizhou, connecting with the Longhai Railway. Shen Baixian, Director of the Construction Department, has been ordered to be responsible for the plan. After receiving the order, Shen invited many senior merchants and engineers from Jiangsu Province to form an inspection team to inspect the planned route. The team has now completed the inspection and submitted the details to the Provincial Department. After receiving the report, the province specifically ordered the county magistrates of Tong, Dong, Yan, Huai, Mu, Hai, and other ten counties to estimate the number and value of the civilian land mu along the route and report to the Provincial Government before May 10 for purchase. Three engineers from the Construction Department, Chen Ziding and Wen Zhengshi, were also dispatched from the province to survey the route. Chen and others arrived in Pu by car from Haizhou on the morning of the 12th. When reporters visited, Wen said that the province has formulated a three-year plan for the development of Jiangbei, and agricultural land and water conservancy are now advancing simultaneously. Industry tycoon Rong Zongjing and others have raised huge sums of money to create the Jiangbei Coastal Trust Farm in the Lianghuai salt wasteland. The province is now aware that without convenient transportation in Jiangbei, other undertakings cannot be carried out step by step. The development of transportation is the foundation for developing various undertakings in Jiangbei. The province has now decided to do its best to build the Tonghai Railway. This road is the main line of transportation in Jiangbei. We (Wen referred to himself) are ordered to resurvey the roadbed. After the ten counties of Tongdong, etc., report the number and value of the civilian land mu along the route to the provincial government for purchase, construction can begin. The entire road (from Nantong to Haizhou) is 470 li long, and the estimated cost is 71.1 million yuan, including 2.2 million yuan for land purchase, 35 million yuan for materials, and 33.8 million yuan for construction. Because this road passes through the Jiangbei Coastal Trust Farm, the transportation of farmland products in the reclamation area will be greatly facilitated after its completion. It will enable Jiangbei agricultural products to be transported to Haizhou to the north via this road, connecting with the Longhai and Jinpu railways, and sold to various provinces in North China. To the south, it can be transported to Nantong via this road, which has a great relationship with the rural commercial economy of Jiangbei. Currently, the Jiangbei Coastal Trust Farm has undertaken 40 million yuan in funding, and the remaining 31.2 million yuan will be raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The Jiangbei Coastal Trust Farm's funds have been borrowed from foreign banks by Rong Zongjing and others, and the method has been agreed upon, and a portion has been allocated. Chen Chairman has managed to raise the 31.2 million yuan borne by the Jiangsu Provincial Government from the provincial treasury, which is in dire straits. The province has contacted the financial community in Beijing and Shanghai several times regarding the remaining 10 million yuan to borrow funds, using the province's special construction funds as collateral, and it is scheduled to be repaid in installments within five years. It is heard that the financial community in Beijing and Shanghai has agreed, so the funding is not a problem. The provincial government is now actively preparing and has decided to start building the roadbed in early June, striving to complete the roadbed by the end of this year and lay the rails and open to traffic next year.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Changshu: Major Fire on Siqian Street <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yongshunyuan Paper Shop, located at No. 44 Siqian Street in this county, has an unusually developed business and can be called the leader in the Changshu paper industry. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 14th of this month at 4 o'clock, a fire broke out and quickly spread. All the goods in the shop were flammable, and the flames lit up the sky for a time. The neighbors on the left and right, hearing the news, quickly got up to rescue, and because this place was located in a bustling street market, it was even more shocking. Fortunately, all the fire brigades arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire, and the neighbors were not affected, but all the goods of the shop were burned down, with losses of more than 10,000 yuan. When the fire was raging, the shop workers living upstairs could not escape because the wooden ladder had broken. Five people jumped out of the upstairs window one after another, and three were injured. One, named Zeng Xuan, was the most seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Male Corpse Found by the River <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>An unnamed male corpse was found in the Yemaokou area of Xizhoushi in the old Tenth District on the morning of the 14th. He was about thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth cotton robe and black trousers, and seemed to be a merchant. The nearby villagers reported to the village chief, who had the corpse retrieved, but the face was slightly rotten, making it difficult to identify the appearance for a while. In the afternoon, an old man came, claiming to be surnamed Xu. After carefully identifying the corpse, he said that the deceased was his son-in-law. Because he had lost his wife last year, he was depressed and unhappy, and his nerves were greatly stimulated. This time, he may have committed suicide by drowning.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Audit of Field Tax Completed by the Provincial Department <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Dihua, Director of the Department of Finance, in order to rectify the abuses of field tax in various counties, specifically sent commissioners to various counties to thoroughly investigate the field tax situation. He discovered major fraud and embezzlement of silver and grain worth 100,000 yuan in Liyang and other counties, so Director Zhao paid more attention to this matter. On the 12th of last month, he sent Commissioner Wu Gengyu to Wuxi to work with the staff of the Field Tax Office to start auditing the version strings stored in the collection office and the silver and grain that had been collected to see if they matched. At the same time, the county government also sent Wang Guangyan and Sun Zhaolin, staff members of the Clearing and Measuring Voucher Office, to review and recalculate after each map was calculated in order to prevent abuses. From October 1927 to the latest first-term land price tax in 1933, the totals were listed and collected by year and by map. By the day before yesterday, the calculation was completed. It was concluded that the total number of version strings stored was the same as the amount of silver owed in the grain cabinet register, without any errors. And the silver and grain collected in this county, from 1915 to 1926, totaled 36 terms, which had been ordered to be exempted by the Department of Finance. After auditing the stored version strings, they were sent to the Department treasury for storage. Only 10% was owed each year. By 1924, the debt was slightly heavier. According to statistics from the two offices, there were more than 187,000 taels of silver and more than 93,000 stones of grain, with 1.65 million Guizi version string households and 1.3 million Yizi version string households. The detailed numbers of the stored version strings were written into a clear register by the Field Tax Office yesterday and reported to the County Government for filing. The version string registers were bound into 30 large boxes and immediately sent to the Department of Finance for storage.</p>

Seeing this, the bus driver immediately turned the car to the left to avoid him, but the child suddenly turned to the left at this time as well. In order to avoid hitting the child, the driver slammed on the brakes. However, the car was moving very fast and could not stop suddenly, so the car body fell to the left. At that time, there were more than a dozen passengers in the car, all of whom were panicked and lost their color. Fortunately, the driver quickly opened the car window, and the passengers were able to climb out. However, Pan Linfang (45 years old), Huang Lihe (39 years old), Zhang Jishi (55 years old), and others suffered serious injuries to their left cheekbones, foreheads, and hands.

<p>At the junction of Huai, Lian, and Shu counties, Wang Youting, the technical director of Lianshui County, previously recruited laborers to build a Lanqing Dam in the autumn of last year, using it to block the water discharged from the Liutang River in Huaiyin. The villagers along the Liutang River in the Fifth District of Huaiyin were greatly dissatisfied and repeatedly submitted petitions to the former Eleventh District Administrative Inspectorate and the Provincial Government, sending personnel to survey the situation and defend their claims, but the matter has not been resolved. Recently, the villagers of Jinba Township in Muyang also spoke up for the people of Lian, saying that the dam must not be removed, otherwise not only would Lianshui be at the lower reaches and suffer floods, but also the farmland in Shuyang would be affected, resulting in a stalemate. Chen Yuezhong, Director of the Canal HuaiPi Section Works, was ordered by the province to conduct a survey, but was unable to go immediately due to being busy with the Liutang River project. The Huaiyin people could not bear it any longer as the flood season was approaching, and they dug open the Lanqing Dam a few days ago. The people of the three counties almost had a melee. Now the province has telegraphed Director Chen again to cooperate with the county chiefs of the above three counties to conduct a survey as soon as possible and resolve the matter quickly. After receiving the order, Chen has scheduled to go to the survey tomorrow morning (the 14th).</p>

<p>In the past five days in Xiaoshan, there has been continuous spring rain and a sudden change in climate. Since the 12th, the temperature has dropped below 50 degrees. Due to mountain floods, the water in the Qiantang River has risen to the same level as the embankment. The water in the Xijiang and Beihai dikes has overflowed, rushing into the dikes, with more than ten breaches. The spring flowers outside the dikes are all submerged in the water, and the loss of farmland and sandy land is 100,000 mu. Looking outward from the dikes, the water is level with the river. The sand people's half-year income is completely hopeless, so the sand people have suffered from floods and are flocking to the inside of the dikes for refuge in an endless stream, which is very miserable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, taking yesterday as the Citizens' Day of the Propaganda Week, in order to expand the propaganda and promote the New Life Movement, held a Citizens' Representative Conference at 9:00 a.m. in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge, and a Lantern Parade at 6:00 p.m. There were tens of thousands of spectators along the way, which was quite a grand occasion. Military police throughout the city were deployed to provide strict guard. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e98">Conference Venue Arrangement <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens' Representative Conference venue was set up in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. High above the front door hung the Party and National flags and a white cloth banner that read "Shanghai New Life Movement Propaganda Week Citizens' Representative Conference." In the auditorium, the portrait of the Premier was hung in the center of the podium, with the Party and National flags forking to the left and right, the press seats on the right, and the recording seats on the left. The New Life Movement slogans were posted all around the conference venue, and the Boy Scouts of the City Chamber of Commerce maintained order in the venue. The police band and the arrangement were simple and tidy.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Attending Representatives <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Those who attended included Tong Hangbai from the City Party Department, Yu Hongjun from the City Government, Lu Yanruo from the New Life Movement Promotion Association, Li Shiyong from the City Supervisory Committee, Wang Xiaolai from the City Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Xuefan and Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, Lu Jingshi from the Postal Workers Union, Yu Zhenhui and Xiao Huihang from the City Agricultural Association, Yang Fukang from the Postal Administration, Lin Kecong and Li Manyun from the Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee, and the representatives of various associations, trade unions, and major middle and primary schools such as Hujiang, Qingnian, Gaochang, Nanyang, Qiuzhi, Minli, Minzhong, Huiqun, Yingqiao, Shuji, Caonan, Huixiang, and Xinmin from the Fourth District Cigarette Industry, Rice Industry, Glass Industry, First District Water and Wood Industry, First District Paper Industry, Match Industry, Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry, City Steamboat Wood Industry, Simple Book Industry, Rice Trading Industry, and others, totaling about 300 people.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Chairman's Report <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>After the ritual was performed, Tong Hangbai of the Presidium reported that all the representatives were able to participate enthusiastically and on time for today's Citizens' Representative Conference of the New Life Movement, which showed that everyone present had a considerable understanding of the promotion of the New Life. Since Chairman Chiang promoted the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the whole country has responded enthusiastically, and its efficiency is self-evident. Although most people have understood the meaning of the New Life, there are still many people who are alienated from this kind of movement. They only know its name but do not know its reality. Here is a brief summary. Our Chinese nation has always emphasized propriety, justice, integrity, and shame, but in the past 100 years, the discipline of life has tended to be romantic and decadent, so Chairman Chiang promoted the New Life to reverse this decadent trend and eliminate bad habits. If the people of the whole country can implement it according to the regulations, then the country can be expected to be strong, otherwise, even if there are no foreign enemies, it will be enough to lead to its demise. It must be known that the implementation of the New Life can relieve the worries and dangers of the country and promote the success of the people's cause. It is hoped that all representatives will encourage each other at any time to achieve implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Yu Hongjun's Speech <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, Yu Hongjun gave a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu Tiecheng, saying that the New Life Movement has been understood by all walks of life since its promotion. Its purpose is very simple. As long as the old morals can be maintained, the New Life Movement can be practiced. Some people in all walks of life do not understand it, thinking that the old life should be abolished urgently after the promotion of the New Life, but the purpose of the promoters is not like this. After all, the old life is not completely bad, and the New Life may not be perfect even after its promotion. It is not because the old life is bad that the New Life is promoted, so its main purpose is not to create a new way of life, but to maintain life with the old morals as the main principle of the New Life. All representatives, we only hear about meetings but do not see implementation. It must be known that in this extremely urgent period in our country, if everyone still holds on to the bad habits of laziness and ease, then the Chinese nation will have no way to save it. That is what is called despair worse than death. If all walks of life quickly realize the danger of the future, cultivate themselves, and pay attention to the implementation of the New Life in order to save themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Lu Jingshi's Speech <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Following that, Lu Jingshi gave a speech, saying that in this depressed society, it is easy to see that the fallen tend to fall further. Once those with aspirations graduate from school and step into society, they will inevitably be disappointed and discouraged, and all their expectations of how to develop themselves and how to serve society will turn to ashes, and they will instead tend to corruption. Those who are guilty of this should be held responsible. At this most dangerous time, we should jointly take responsibility to reform the bad habits in society, so that young people with aspirations will not be discouraged, but will strive forward, and everyone can achieve the purpose of cultivating themselves, managing their families, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. That is, we want to create a militarized society for the people and reform all the corrupt atmosphere. This is the purpose of the revolutionary leader Chairman Chiang's promotion, but the biggest drawback of our people is not being diligent in practice, so in my humble opinion, the New Life, on top of moral sanctions, may as well be assisted by political power. After the speech, Zhu Xuefan, the representative of the General Labor Union, gave a speech (speech omitted). At 11:30 a.m., slogans were called, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Conference Slogans <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>

Yesterday, the company dispatched another aircraft to scatter reward leaflets and continue the search in the vicinity of Jintang Mountain and Yuxingnao, but there were still no results as of 6:00 PM in the evening. The Sekos aircraft stranded at the Zhenhai Estuary was towed back to Shanghai by Nie Kaiyi yesterday with a tugboat and is now at the Longhua Repair Factory for repairs. According to Nie Kaiyi, despite three days of careful searching along the coast, there was still no clue. Yesterday, the company's manager, Dai Enji, convened a meeting of experts and technicians to discuss further search methods and plans to send several more aircraft to search for the whereabouts this morning. As of last night, there was still no evidence that the passengers on the missing plane were ordinary businessmen or had other business. All parties still consider it a suspicious clue. The Shanghai-Guangdong route is temporarily suspended due to the missing aircraft. The company will convene a board meeting in the coming days to discuss solutions and is rumored to order new aircraft from the United States to restore the Shanghai-Guangdong route. According to the company's statement yesterday, there are no plans to suspend the route. The company is actively planning to add various facilities to the route to ensure safety. Other routes are operating as usual and have not been affected in any way.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products Declaration　Support Chairman Chiang's Order　Stop Unauthorized Strikes and Work Stoppages <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products deeply laments that labor-management disputes occur frequently among its factory members, which are not beneficial to either party or may escalate beyond control. This not only affects the factories themselves but also endangers social order. The Standing Committee previously instructed the Planning Department to design countermeasures to eliminate disputes and seek welfare. Now, after reading Chairman Chiang's order to stop unauthorized strikes and work stoppages, the association is deeply gratified for the entire national products industry. Yesterday, the Standing Committee decided to issue a declaration to enthusiastically support the order. The declaration is excerpted as follows: "Promoting national products is the legacy of the Premier's peaceful struggle to save China, and it is especially the basic principle of saving the country during the current national crisis. National products factories, adhering to this spirit, endure pain and hardship and strive to produce in the hope of completing the task of national revival in the process of industrial development. However, in recent years, due to social unrest, national misfortunes, and the economic recession in rural areas, they have been operating hard and barely supporting themselves. They are also constrained by the dumping of foreign goods and affected by the surge in labor unrest, resulting in huge losses and a precarious situation, leading to the trend of industrial decline and factory bankruptcy. This not only reduces the country's due production but also endangers social order. The harm is so severe that it is like entering a point of no return. The national products industry is originally a matter of shared prosperity and mutual dependence for both labor and management. Factories should care for their workers, and workers should work hard, overcome difficulties together, and strengthen the national foundation. The aim is to concentrate national products to save the country, avenge national humiliation, and resist foreign aggression."</p>
<p>"Now, labor-management disputes arise from time to time, causing both sides to sacrifice and feel pain. Moreover, the disputes have escalated beyond control, causing factories to shut down and become unsustainable, leading to an increasing number of unemployed people and creating opportunities for foreign goods to sell well. The association witnesses this dangerous situation and feels great pain. We respectfully read Chairman Chiang's order to stop unauthorized strikes and work stoppages, which hits the nail on the head, eliminates the source of trouble, benefits the country and the people, and is deeply beneficial. We hereby express our utmost sincerity, lead all factory members to enthusiastically support the order, and, under the guidance of party and government agencies, intensify the national products movement, strive to produce, realize the Premier's legacy, and revive the nation. This declaration is hereby made."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance　Protesting U.S. Increase in Sesame Import Tax <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance, stating, "On the 12th of this month, we received a letter from the Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association stating, 'We received a letter from Ji Yuantang stating that we received a joint letter from Grain Store Yuanhe Ren and others stating that domestic sesame has always been mainly sold to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In recent years, the same economic recession has occurred abroad, so foreign trade is only about one-tenth of what it was in previous years. We now receive telegrams from foreign merchants stating that the U.S. government proposes to increase the sesame import tax to five cents per pound. According to recent prices, selling to foreign firms is only worth seven yuan in national currency per 100 catties. If the U.S. tax rate is applied, it would be equivalent to more than 20 yuan in Chinese currency per 100 catties. This policy is tantamount to rejecting Chinese goods imports and cutting off Chinese merchants' sales channels. Please discuss and come up with relief measures, etc.' After discussion, we believe that this matter concerns international trade and is of great importance. Please forward the letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and cable the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs to strongly urge the U.S. government,' etc. At the same time, we also received a letter from the Bean and Rice Trade Association with the same content. Upon investigation, domestic sesame is not in great demand domestically and is mostly sold to the United Kingdom and the United States. In the past, the value was 12 to 13 yuan per 100 catties, and imports were tax-free. In recent years, the price has gradually declined and is on the verge of collapse. According to the current market price of sesame sold abroad, including the domestic customs tax, it is worth about 7 yuan per catty. Counting shipping costs, it is worth only 113 yuan per ton. If the U.S. government's policy of increasing the import tax to five cents per pound is implemented, then at 2,000 pounds per U.S. ton, it would be an additional 100 U.S. dollars per ton. Assuming a U.S. exchange rate of 35 yuan, it would be equivalent to 285.7 yuan in Chinese currency, which is 2.5 times the current value. The decline of China's rural areas has reached its extreme. The way to revival is not limited to one aspect. Smoothing sales channels and increasing value are the most important tasks. Although sesame is a by-product, the annual exports are not small and have a relationship with the rural economy, which is not a trivial matter. The current sharp drop in prices has already hit farmers hard. If sales channels are cut off due to the U.S. government imposing heavy taxes, the disaster will be even more unbearable. The permission to forward the letter is especially requested for you to promptly cable the Ministry of Finance and Foreign Affairs, requesting the U.S. government to uphold the spirit of coexistence and co-prosperity and revoke the aforementioned motion. We eagerly await your purchase, etc.' We have received the letter. Upon investigation, China's international trade has always seen exports of agricultural products and imports of manufactured goods. The annual trade deficit is already very large. Recently, foreign agricultural products have turned to China as a major import, while China's exports have been affected by the economic depression and heavy taxes, and are obstructed everywhere. In the past two years, the magnitude of the trade surplus has broken the highest record since the opening of mutual markets. If we do not seek to remedy the situation urgently, the people will be impoverished and the wealth will be exhausted, which can be expected in the near future. The association's request to consult with the United States to reduce taxes is a necessary procedure, but each country's increase in taxes has its own position, and tariff autonomy is also its internal affairs. Commercial requests based on virtue and righteousness may not be very effective. The method of addressing the root cause seems to be to predetermine a sliding scale of taxes on each country's special products exported to China, which can be raised or lowered at any time, as a countermeasure. (Omitted in the middle) The matter concerns saving the declining trend of international trade and is not limited to the local interests of the industry. How should we carefully plan for countermeasures? It is appropriate to cable your ministry for review and approval to provide assistance."</p>

<h3 id="e134">City Chamber of Commerce's Letter to the Customs Administration Regarding Extending the Deadline for Tax Refunds on Re-levied Taxes <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Customs Administration yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Customs Administration, we received a letter on the 13th of this month from the Hub North San Shan Fu Ning Guild, stating that the Fujian Puppet People's Government is re-imposing consolidated taxes. Previously, the Consolidated Tax Bureau had approved that within three months of the re-imposition, the original tax receipts and sub-bills of lading along with the re-imposed tax receipts could be submitted to the bureau for a tax refund. However, the goods transported to Fujian are not only sold near the provincial capital; the majority are distributed to northern and western Fujian. These areas have been plagued by bandits and military operations in recent months, and the remote locations have even been cut off from transportation. Information could not be exchanged for one or two months, resulting in most tax receipts being delayed due to transportation obstructions and difficulties with postal delivery, making it impossible to submit them on time. Having previously expressed these difficulties, the Shanghai Municipal Flour Guild requested the Consolidated Tax Bureau to extend the deadline by three months, but the reply stated that the matter was related to general cases and could not be handled accordingly. However, all the procedures for the tax receipts that have been sent are complete; only the dates are slightly past the deadline. If they are deemed invalid according to the regulations, the losses would be too heavy, and the reasons for the delay are due to special obstructions and not intentional delay. It seems that special consideration should be given. We are now submitting one hundred and thirty-one original tax receipts, twenty-four re-imposed tax receipts, seventy-three sub-bills of lading, and nine Fujian customs documents, totaling four thousand two hundred and seventy national currency units re-imposed, for your esteemed association to review and collect. We hope that you will submit them to the Ministry of Finance on our behalf, requesting that the tax bureau be instructed to handle the overdue tax receipts that have already been sent with flexibility, approve the tax refund, and extend the deadline for the re-imposed tax receipts of the Fujian Puppet People's Government by three months to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. We earnestly hope for your assistance," the letter stated. Upon receiving this, we have reviewed that the original intention of allowing the submission of various documents within three months of the re-imposition to request verification and tax refund from your esteemed administration was to maintain the consolidated tax system, ensuring that taxes would not be re-imposed after the initial tax. Therefore, the stipulation of the deadline should not conflict with this main purpose. The intention of your esteemed administration in setting a three-month deadline was merely to provide merchants with sufficient time to handle the matter. If the deadline is exceeded, it would seem that merchants are too negligent regarding their own rights, and merchants should bear the blame for the error, and your esteemed administration would no longer have the responsibility to protect them. This is the underlying intention. However, the distribution of goods in northern and western Fujian, after the removal of the provincial pretender government, was further complicated by the progress of bandit suppression military operations, leading to transportation disruptions and a lack of communication for one or two months. This situation could not have been foreseen when your esteemed administration set the deadline, and it was also beyond the merchants' ability to remedy, with no negligence on their part. Approving an extension of the deadline is precisely to maintain the spirit of not re-imposing consolidated taxes. The matter is special and does not impede general cases. We request that your esteemed administration approve the request for handling. As for the various tax receipts attached by the guild that have just been sent, the dates may be slightly different, and it is due to military obstruction. We request that you first verify and approve the tax refund to avoid unexpected losses. We are publicly grateful. All the various tax receipts and customs documents have been separately extracted into a list and attached to this letter. We hope that your esteemed administration will verify and handle them and reply accordingly."</p>

<h3 id="e136">City Chamber of Commerce Letter to the Post Office Regarding Improving Tax Standards for Medicine Packages <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Post Office Tax Collection Department yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Post Office Tax Collection Department, on the 13th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, stating that a member, the Sino-French Pharmacy, wrote that when sending parcels, the Post Office Tax Collection Department used the original drug price list submitted by the China-America Pharmacy to the Customs last year as the basis for ordering taxes based on the sales price on that list. Although they repeatedly explained, they were not listened to, and there was a strong tendency to detain the goods if they did not comply. Under these circumstances, considering the unreasonableness of these people, they had no choice but to painfully pay the tax. Considering that this matter concerns all colleagues in the industry and the future is long, the harm is unimaginable, they sent a letter requesting assistance. The prices of imported goods not only vary from morning to night, but also the finished medicines of various countries are no exception. This is a normal change in commerce. How can the market price of one company in the same industry last year be applied to the goods of this year? Especially since the market price of this industry is even more different in the past two years, how can they be compared? Moreover, the selling price and the estimated price have always been fixed, and they cannot be viewed as the same. Now, the estimated price that they are being forced to revise is much higher than the current selling price for many items. How can merchants bear this kind of tax payment method? They plan to ask your esteemed association to negotiate on their behalf," the letter stated. Upon review, the matters mentioned by the pharmacy are indeed factual. Correspondingly, we are sending a letter requesting your esteemed association to send a letter to the Post Office Tax Collection Department, arguing based on reason. This is our earnest hope. Based on this, the market price of medicines changes from time to time, which is a common practice in general commerce. The estimated tax for postal packages should be based on the current value and accurately estimated, which is sufficient to show fairness. Now, your department is using the original drug price list submitted by the China-America Pharmacy to the Customs last year as the basis for collecting postal tax on medicine packages from the Sino-French Pharmacy, which is excessively higher than the current market price. How can this be used as the standard for tax collection? Correspondingly, we are sending a letter stating the situation, hoping that your esteemed department will take note of it. In the future, the estimated price of medicine packages should be based on the actual market price at the time of mailing, without overcollection, to maintain commerce. We earnestly hope for your assistance, etc."</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Case of Le Zhenbao's Kidnapping: The Main Culprit is the Owner of a Car Company, Also Involved in Two Other Kidnapping Cases. The Police Added Charges, and the Trial Was Rescheduled. <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Le Zhenbao, owner of Taichang Wood Shop on Nanjing Road, was kidnapped by bandits at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Hede Road at 9:30 AM on December 9th, 1932, and a huge ransom was demanded. Later, Chief Detective You A'gen of the Zhabei Police Station rescued Le from a villa at No. 911 Haige Road and arrested more than ten people, including Ma Gensheng, Guan Afu, and Ren Zixiang, who were handed over to the First Special Court for sentencing. However, according to the confessions of the criminals, the main culprit in this case was Lu Jinbao (also known as Yunlun Jiting), a Taizhou native and the owner of the Lulinji Automobile Company on Kunming Road. Because Lu was on the run at the time, the court issued an arrest warrant. Subsequently, Chief Detective You and Detective Liu Junqing arrested Lu on Edward Road and sent him to the First Special Court. Because the case files of Ma Gensheng and others had been sent to the Supreme Court, it was difficult to proceed, and the court ordered a rescheduling. More than four months have passed since then, and the files have now been returned. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide of the court's criminal division opened the trial. Lu Yunlun hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng for defense, and police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the police had found that the defendant was also involved in the kidnapping cases of Sheng Yishao and Tian Wuxing, and therefore added charges. Le Zhenbao then submitted a petition detailing his kidnapping experience, stating that after being kidnapped, the bandits ordered him to sit facing the wall and put on dark glasses, so he did not see the faces of the bandits. The court asked if the defendant had been seen in the bandits' lair, and he replied that he had not. When questioned, Lu Yunlun resolutely denied the charges and said that he did not know any of the convicted criminals. Police lawyer Li stated that Liu Ziyu had been sentenced to death for kidnapping Fan Aisheng, but Liu was also an accomplice in the kidnappings of Le Zhenbao and Tian Wuxing. The police had originally intended to prosecute him together, but if they did so, the same case would have to be handled by two judges, which would be more troublesome, so it was included in this case to save time. However, Liu Ziyu was not present today, so he requested a rescheduling. Judge Feng ordered a rescheduling for one week. Lawyer Zhan then stated that the defendant was currently detained in the West Prison on Huade Road, which was inconvenient for meeting and collecting evidence. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be temporarily detained at the police station, as his life was at stake, and asked the court to approve the request. The court approved the request.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Daily News, Osaka native Iuchi Hisayoshi, currently residing at No. 9, Tongqing Lane, Zhabei Road, came to Shanghai in 1932. In May of the same year, he established the Second Da Jinzi Company on Minhang Road, which was later renamed Da Haiyang Company. Last year, he returned to his country and met his fellow fruit merchant Kisamuro Hashimura, who asked him to come to Shanghai to sell Korean apples. In January of this year, Hashimura secretly mixed 1,700 pounds of rayon into 160 boxes of apples and shipped them from Incheon Port in Korea to the Shanghai Da Haiyang Company. He also entrusted Masataka Naramura from Okayama (currently residing at No. 6, Lane 44, Youheng Road) to sell them. Masataka then contacted Cao Jianqiu, a Chinese merchant at the Chengdang Ocean Company on Youheng Road, and a deal was reached. On February 2nd, he went to Higuchi Customs Brokerage to complete customs clearance procedures in the name of Chengdang Ocean Company. The goods had safely landed at the Yushan Wharf on Zhabei Road, but the matter was discovered by a warehouse manager, and the secret smuggling was not achieved. After interrogation by the Consul General, the whole story was clarified, and the two criminals will be prosecuted.</p>

<p>At about 1:10 PM yesterday afternoon, at the corner of the intersection of Kaisen Road and Dunxin Road in Shanghai West, a truck with city license number 3392, driven by Lu Baolin, was speeding from east to west. When turning, he accidentally collided with a private car with city license number 6418, driven by an American, causing damage to the front of the car. As the two sides were stopping to negotiate, a police car dispatched from the Jingansi Police Station with officers number 256 (a Western officer) and number 332 (a Chinese officer) arrived. The Western officer went forward to investigate. By this time, a crowd had gathered. Suddenly, two soldiers from the security team stationed at the nearby Sanjing Temple, Chen Genrong and Dai Jinwen, caught sight of the crowd and went forward to watch. However, as soon as they arrived, the Western officer, for some unknown reason, kicked soldier Chen Genrong violently. Chen tried to endure the pain and ask questions, but Dai Jinwen felt that the Western officer's actions were unreasonable, as the two sides could not communicate. He immediately pulled Chen away by the arms, trying to bear the pain and leave. Unexpectedly, after only a few steps, the Western officer turned around and caught up, pulled out a baton from his waist, and struck Chen on the top of his head, causing him to bleed and fall to the ground in pain. Dai then returned to the team to report. The Western officer, seeing that he had caused trouble, immediately got into the car and sped away. The police officer on duty at the Kaisen Road observation post in District Six heard about it and rushed to the scene to investigate. He immediately reported to District Six, which in turn reported to the General Bureau for verification. The injured soldier was also taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Shao Yunpeng, Yunfa, Yunjun, Yunqi, Yunlin, and Yunxiang, natives of Yuyao and nephews of the late Sheng Xuanhuai, filed a criminal lawsuit and attached civil suit against Sheng's brothers, sisters, nephews, and nieces last year after their maternal grandmother, Sheng Zhuangshi, passed away and her estate was divided by her descendants. They claimed that their mother should also have received a share, but it was seized by their maternal uncle, Sheng Zecheng, and others. The First Special District Court has already concluded the criminal part of the trial, acquitting the defendants. The civil part was finally opened by Judge Qiao Wanxuan for questioning yesterday afternoon. Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants appeared in person. According to the plaintiffs' lawyer, the amount of Sheng Zhuangshi's estate needs to be determined by reviewing the previous criminal case files. Therefore, the amount of litigation fees to be paid must be determined after the amount is verified. Judge Qiao then ordered a rescheduling for further verification.</p>
<h3 id="e146">After Hu Ganqing's Death, an Outside Wife Sues for Division of Property: Repeated Settlements Fail, Arguments Concluded, and Judgment Scheduled <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Hu Ganqing, a native of Hangzhou and a shareholder in Fuchang Ginseng Shop in Nanshi and Hu Qingyutang Pharmacy on Beijing Road, left a considerable estate after his death the year before last. In addition to his shares in the two shops, he also owned a residence on Guling Road, worth more than 100,000 yuan. He also had a penchant for women and had three concubines, one surnamed Xue and two surnamed Li. Recently, Xue, accompanied by her daughter Hu Qiaoyun, hired lawyer Lu Dingkui to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the First Special District Court against Hu Shanqing, Hu Ganqing's son, requesting a division of one-third of the 300,000 yuan estate. The court has repeatedly opened trials, ordering the parties to try to settle out of court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong again took the bench in Civil Division Six to continue the trial and asked both parties about the settlement situation. According to the defendant's lawyers, Lu Shaozong and Lin Yinqing, since the case was rescheduled, the two parties had once tried to settle, and the defendant was willing to pay 3,000 yuan and a monthly allowance of 30 yuan to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff thought it was too far off and refused to settle. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, Lu Dingkui, stated that it was not that the plaintiff refused to settle. The defendant owns a huge amount of property, such as a residence on Guling Road, worth 140,000 yuan, plus shares in various places, totaling several hundred thousand yuan. Now the defendant is only willing to pay 3,000 yuan and 30 yuan per month, which is too small to settle. Moreover, the current assets of the Fuchang Ginseng Shop are estimated to be over a million, and Hu Ganqing alone accounts for five shares. According to the shop's books, the dividends under Hu Ganqing's name reach as high as 10,000 taels each year. Therefore, the amount requested by the plaintiff is not beyond the defendant's ability to pay. He requested that the court order the defendant to allocate one-third of the property to Qiaoyun and 14,580 yuan for the plaintiff's living expenses. Judge Shen then asked the defendant Hu Shanqing if he could increase the amount to the plaintiff. Hu replied that he could not, because his late father still had two concubines surnamed Li at home. If he increased the amount again, the two concubines at home would definitely request the same. Then, Madam Hu Xue stated that since her husband's death, her family has been paying her a monthly living allowance of 30 yuan, but it was suddenly stopped on the second day of the first month of this year. She now requests that the trial proceed. Judge Shen, considering the case clear, ordered the arguments to begin. The lawyers for both parties then argued for a long time. The court adjourned the arguments and scheduled the judgment for 2:00 PM on April 19.</p>

<p>The main store of Taikang Company on Nanjing Road opened on March 31st, with great success. Yesterday, it held an opening ceremony for its new factory, located on the bank of Nanfenglin Bridge. From 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, guests gathered at the Nanjing Road main store and were transported to the factory in group buses. No less than three or four thousand guests attended. Upon leaving the factory, each person received a large bag of biscuits and candies with a voucher, and everyone who received it was happy. The details of the opening ceremony are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e150">General Layout: The factory gate faces Xiaomubiao Road, and the <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>buildings face south, with bright light and ample air. A colorful archway is erected at the front gate, decorated with the words "Opening Ceremony" and "Welcome." Tea and refreshments, made by the factory, are served in the reception hall and upstairs, which are exquisite and fresh. The walls are filled with inscriptions and gifts, a feast for the eyes. The inscriptions of celebrities such as Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Gongbo, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Qiaqing add to the splendor. Visitors are led by the reception, and the entrance and exit are clearly marked. Although there are many guests, the order is well-maintained.</p>
<p>Key Equipment: The factory building is divided into three main sections. The back section, at the entrance, has several rooms for offices, as well as raw material storage, mouth-point manufacturing department, Western-style pastry manufacturing department, bread manufacturing department, canned food seasoning department, utensil storage room, welding department, restaurant, and after-work night school. The middle section has the machine room and woodworking department at the back, and the canned food manufacturing department, machine can-making department, canning and weighing sealing cooling department, and biscuit manufacturing department downstairs in the middle section. Upstairs are the flour sifting room and packaging room. Among them, the machinery for biscuit manufacturing is the most convenient and efficient in terms of layout and sequence, and the daily output is over 100,000. This is because the machinery is newly purchased and is the best in China. The front section is the dormitory and warehouse, and there is another room that is a chemical research laboratory, with equipment such as a constant temperature device and a fat measuring device for testing canned goods. The equipment can be described as complete.</p>
<p>Ceremony Report: There is a hall upstairs in the reception hall, with a table in the middle covered with a red curtain. At 10:30 AM, the meeting began with music, and the distinguished guests gathered. After performing the ceremony as usual, Ye Yunzhi, the chairman of the factory's board of directors, delivered a speech. Guest Yue Junbao performed the unveiling ceremony, and at the same time, cannons were fired and flags were raised. Then, General Manager Yue Rucheng reported on the evolution of the business, followed by speeches by Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Shenzhi, Wu Yaqin, and Hong Yanbin. The speeches were mostly praises and encouragements, which are omitted due to length. After that, the chairman gave a thank you, took photos, and served tea and refreshments. The ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Excerpt from the Evolution: Taikang was founded in Jinan in 1914 by Yue Rucheng, Xu Yongchun, and Zhuang Baokang. It was initially an unlimited partnership that sold Chinese and foreign foods. It then imitated the production of canned foods, candies, and biscuits. It expanded several times in 1918, 1921, 1922, and 1923. In the winter of 1921, it first established a wholesale office in Shanghai. In 1927, it changed from an unlimited company to a limited company with a paid-up capital of 150,000 yuan and was approved for registration. In 1933, it again increased its capital to 500,000 yuan. Today, its products are sold all over the country, and even to Little Luzon, Rangoon, Singapore, and Siam. Its five-pound "Fu" character red tin biscuits and spiced ribbonfish, whose quality is superior to imported products and have a special flavor, are especially well-known in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Fish Industry Guild Answers Regarding British-Produced Small Green Kawakawa Fish: Can Verify if Markings Match <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association received a letter from the Dinghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stating that upon investigation, some small Green Kawakawa fish have certificates from the Canadian or American consulate, and fish merchants in the county are requesting to sell them. Some have no certificates, and even those with certificates have discrepancies in the quantity of goods arriving, either exceeding or falling short of what is stated on the certificate (e.g., the certificate states five boxes, but there are only two boxes, or one box, or seven boxes of Green Kawakawa fish). The question is whether these Green Kawakawa fish without certificates or with discrepancies are enemy goods, and a request was made for investigation. After receiving the letter, the association sent a letter to the Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Guild for inquiry. Yesterday, the guild replied, stating that the small Green Kawakawa fish are produced in British Canada and are handled by German, American, British, and Japanese merchants. They are not produced in Taiwan. The goods sold by the guild's members are purchased from German and British merchants. The discrepancy in the number of boxes and the certificate is due to the certificate being pre-printed. For example, if the certificate is printed for five boxes, but the purchaser only buys two boxes, they can only attach the five-box certificate. The box markings can be compared with the certificate markings to see if they match. If they do not match, they are enemy goods. Some unscrupulous merchants do sell enemy goods, and their box markings are inconsistent, meaning the goods lack proper certification.</p>

<p>The China-America Tobacco Company, established for less than a year, has seen its Red and Blue "Buy Sigan" brand cigarettes become popular nationwide, making it a rising authority in the Chinese tobacco industry. The company's staff is further encouraged to establish unwavering principles in the movement to promote domestic cigarettes, serving as pioneers in changing the previous imitation of foreign styles. The Guanghua brand cigarettes, launched yesterday, were produced to realize these principles. The so-called principles are fourfold: 1) the flavor of the cigarettes must be richer than foreign cigarettes; 2) the price must be lower than foreign cigarettes; 3) the quality must be guaranteed never to change; 4) the packaging must have a spirit of innovation. The Guanghua brand's packaging uses ancient cultural relics for the can design, with elegant colors and purely Eastern art, with few foreign words. This alone is an unprecedented creation in the Chinese cigarette industry. Moreover, the flavor is rich, the price is low, and the quality is guaranteed to remain unchanged. Entitled "Chinese Standard Cigarettes," who would say it is not appropriate? They are sold at Wing On, Sincere, The Sun Sun, Lihua, The China National Goods Company, Fuan, and major tobacco and paper shops throughout the city, priced at four jiao per pack.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Hu Die Sues South China Society for Termination of Trademark Contract; Debate Concluded, Sentence Scheduled <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The South China Chemical Industry Society previously signed a contract with movie queen Hu Die, using her portrait as a trademark to manufacture various cosmetics such as toothpaste, cologne, powder, and vanishing cream. At the time of signing the contract, 1,000 yuan in cash was paid, and a percentage of the annual operating income would be sent to Hu Die as compensation. However, the contract included a note stating that if, after one year of signing the contract, South China Society did not manufacture and sell the goods, Hu Die could request termination of the contract at any time. Subsequently, South China Society engaged in manufacturing goods and advertising their release, which caused a dispute with the Invincible Brand trademark of the Family Industry Society, leading to years of litigation. South China Society delayed manufacturing and selling goods due to the litigation. Hu Die believed that South China Society violated the contract and requested South China Society to terminate the contract, which was rejected. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Local Court, requesting termination of the contract with South China Society. However, the initial trial resulted in Hu Die's failure. Hu Die then hired lawyers Feng Xizui and Qin Liankui to appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the High Court opened an investigation court to review the evidence and concluded, the case was heard the day before yesterday by presiding judge Guo Dezhang, along with associate judges Zhang Chaozuo and Li Shouyi. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The court first summoned a person A, the director of Bao Wen Printing Press, to testify about the process of printing the silver star toothpaste, powder, and Hu Die toothpaste envelopes for the South China Chemical Industry Society, and verified the samples of the three envelopes submitted and the account books. Subsequently, after the appellant's lawyers Feng and Qin and the appellee's lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Zhouxun debated, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate and announced that a sentence would be scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Minutes of the Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of Shanghai Mental Hospital <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mental Hospital on Guling Road, Ren'an Lane held a joint meeting of executive directors and supervisors on the fifth floor of the Bank Club the night before last. More than 20 people attended, including Xu Qianlin, Shao Daren, Xie Baosheng, Pan Shouren, Qiao Nianchun, Chuan Zuoheng, and Pang Daozong. Chairman Xu Shiying was temporarily unable to attend due to a sore throat and appointed Huang Bodu to represent him as chairman. After the meeting began, the president of the hospital, Gu Wenjun, gave a speech. The vice president, Song Chengchang, reported that after the establishment of the hospital's board of executive directors, Xu Shiying was appointed chairman, Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin were appointed vice-chairmen, and Shen Baoyi, Yuan Xilian, Qiao Nianchun were appointed supervisors. Xu Qianlin, Xie Qianggong, and Gu Wenjun were appointed as standing directors, but the two positions of finance and secretary had not yet been filled. They should be appointed today. Pan Shouren was elected as the finance director, and Wang Liangqing was elected as the secretary. He then reported on the hospital's affairs, stating that in the past six months, the hospital had cured more than 150 severe cases of dementia, more than 40 of whom were sent by the Special Zone Court, police stations, and various agencies. In addition to free and half-price cases, the damage to equipment and clothing torn by the insane patients was significant. He asked how the hospital's expenses should be addressed. Xu Qianlin then proposed that since the hospital's opening, the continuous expenses had been borrowed by President Gu, exceeding 14,000 yuan, and the annual need was estimated at 17,000 yuan. The hospital's performance was good, and the number of patients sent from far and wide was increasing daily, increasing the expenses. If no measures were taken to maintain it, it would be difficult to sustain. The current emergency method was to raise 30,000 yuan first. All attendees today should each sign up for donations or solicit donations to reach the total amount to repay the loans and maintain the hospital's operations. As a result, about 4,000 yuan was signed up for donations on the spot, and the rest would be raised separately. It was also decided that the situation discussed today should be reported to the three chairmen Xu, Du, and Zhang for approval. It was unanimously said that the three chairmen were very concerned about the hospital and would surely take good care of it in the future. It was then discussed that future donation receipts should be signed and sealed jointly by the president and the finance director to show solemnity. Everyone agreed and passed it unanimously. The meeting was then adjourned after dinner.</p>

<h3 id="e164">After Separation, Lawsuit Filed Over Son's Education <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>In the Wanzhao Courtyard, Fuxiang Lane, Fuzhou Road, there was a prostitute named Zhou Laoqi, who was favored by the customer Huang Jianqing. In January of the year before last, the two began living together in a room downstairs in Wanzhao Building. The prostitute soon became pregnant, and in September of that year, she gave birth to a son, named Shouhua, who is now three years old. However, Huang Jianqing, although fond of sensuality, was not devoted. Last year, he wanted to abandon Zhou, and a lawsuit was filed in the Second Special District Local Court. The court ruled to allow the separation of the couple, and ordered Huang Jianqing to pay Zhou Laoqi 3,000 yuan in alimony. Now, Zhou claims that Huang has a responsibility to raise and educate the son he had with her, but Huang has long stopped providing living expenses. If she does not negotiate with him, the child will inevitably suffer from cold and hunger. Therefore, as the legal guardian, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Huang in the First Special District Local Court, requesting: 1) confirmation that Huang Shouhua is Huang Jianqing's biological son; 2) an order for Huang Jianqing to pay 8,000 yuan in one lump sum to be deposited in a bank with 5% interest, which would yield 40 yuan per month for Huang Shouhua's living expenses; 3) an order for Huang Jianqing to pay 4,000 yuan for Huang Shouhua's education from elementary school to university graduation. The First Special District Court has already summoned him, and due to the need to summon additional witnesses, the hearing was postponed to yesterday afternoon. The witness Zhong Shuzhen, a female obstetrician, testified that she went to Zhou Laoqi's house to deliver the baby when Zhou was in labor, and at that time Zhou was living in Sandefang. Fang Xiuying, a woman, testified that she was Zhou Laoqi's cousin, Laoqi was Huang Jianqing's concubine, and Shouhua was born to Jianqing and Laoqi. She also went to the banquet in Sandefang when the child was one month old, and there were five or six tables of guests that day. Subsequently, the debate began. The plaintiff's lawyer said that there was considerable evidence regarding the biological son issue, and the defendant should be responsible for education. According to the law, the child can be taken away by the father, but the defendant has already separated from Zhou, and the defendant has not provided alimony since last year. When the case was filed in the Second Special District Court, the defendant even denied paternity, so he has no affection for his son and cannot be expected to educate him. Now that there are these special circumstances, the child is only three years old and still needs breastfeeding. It is impossible to separate the mother and child. Therefore, they requested that the child be allowed to be raised by his mother and that the defendant be ordered to provide living and education expenses totaling 12,000 yuan. Furthermore, the defendant is about to go to Japan, and to avoid difficulties in enforcement, they requested that the defendant be ordered to pay the amount in one lump sum. The defendant's lawyer replied that Zhou Laoqi was still living a dissolute life when she was pregnant, so according to the law, he cannot be recognized as the biological father and can only be considered an adopted son. Now that Zhou has separated from the defendant, the defendant should raise him, so there is no question of living and education expenses at all. They requested that the original lawsuit be rejected. Judge Qiao then ordered that a sentence be scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Rent Dispute in Xicheng Lane, French Concession; Mediation Has Already Failed; Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>There are hundreds of houses in Xicheng Lane, at the intersection of Ximen Road and Malone Road in the French Concession. All the tenants organized the Xicheng Lane Branch of the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation to handle negotiations and unanimously carry out the rent reduction movement with various sectors and issue a declaration. Subsequently, someone took on the role of mediator, but the landlord's side stubbornly adhered to its views and refused to make any concessions on the contract. Moreover, Article 2 of the contract stated that if the rent was not paid before the fifth of each month, the tenant must vacate the house. The tenants requested improvements, but not a word was allowed. As a result, the mediation had already failed. The landlord's side has been sending urgent letters urging tenants to sign the contract, or they will have to vacate the house and move elsewhere. The tenants are very apprehensive and have reported to the branch association to quickly discuss countermeasures. The association held a temporary board meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Fourth District Branch in Anxin Temple on Bauer Road. More than ten people attended. The chairman, Yao Weng'er, reported on the purpose of the meeting and the process of mediation failure in recent days. The board members expressed their opinions and decided on the following countermeasures: 1) Notify all tenants to deny the illegal contract. Declare that those who have signed are invalid and those who have not signed should stop signing. 2) The lawyer Wu Zhenming's letter of more than seventy letters from the landlord's representative will be refuted by the association with reason. 3) If the landlord uses legal accusations, the association's legal counsel will represent them in court. 4) The facts of the landlord's oppression will be submitted to the Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and various organizations to find ways to stop it. 5) When necessary, representatives will be sent to the party and government agencies to hold a large-scale petition. 6) All expenses will be borne by the public, recognized by all. 7) Collect evidence of the collector's illegal actions and prepare to deal with it according to law. Convene a general meeting when necessary. 8) After the above cases are discussed, report the situation to the higher authorities for filing in order to expedite assistance. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

All the machines are made in China and are self-made. All its equipment is modern, which is a new record in the national goods industry. Therefore, its products are highly valued in the market. The sales are so smooth that even foreign goods cannot surpass it. It is also said that the industry is in charge and is very praised.</p>

<h3 id="e178">How to Study Education (Continued) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Answer to Wang Yin</p>
<p>Yesterday, we posed the question "What is the purpose of studying education?" to Mr. Wang Yin, and briefly explained the essence of modern education. Today, we present to Mr. Gan and all those preparing to become educators the attitude that an educator should take.</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>Of course, by saying this, we absolutely do not mean to neglect education or oppose the study of education. Education is one of the superstructures of society, and its development is certainly determined by the development of society, but at the same time, it can also influence and even promote the development of society. Our intention is only to correct the generally incorrect views on education and to indicate what education is at the current stage. To determine the purpose of studying education, without understanding the essence of education, without understanding the evolution of education, and wanting to recognize the trends of new education, there is no way to start. Moreover, we do not deny that under the current educational system, behind the privileged education, there are many hard-working educators who are striving for new education. This is just like in the capitalist system, there is a new force lurking that will destroy capitalism. Precisely because of this, we should not be blinded by vulgar educators, but should find our own way forward, abandon the education exclusively for the few, and strive for the growth of new education that can truly become the masses.</p>
<p>Under the natural law of social progress, the new education of the future will inevitably take a position opposite to the education of all stages before capitalism. The previous education was opposed to labor and was a tool for the few to control the people: the new education should belong to the masses and should essentially turn to combining with production. This is not like the general educators of today who emptyly shout "Education to save the country," but a natural product in a great social system reform. If this is understood, the proper purpose of studying education will not be difficult to recognize.</p>
<p>Now that we have a proper purpose, how should we begin our research journey?</p>
<p>Education is not only a problem that can be solved by theoretical exploration alone, but is also a practical subject. That is, just as studying physics and chemistry, it is not enough to remember a few formulas, but what is even more needed is experimentation. Therefore, for this question, we will temporarily divide it into two aspects.</p>
<p>Regarding theoretical research, in addition to education itself, as Mr. Wang Yin asked, what fundamental knowledge must be possessed when studying education? This is indeed the most important question for those who study education. Our answer is that the fundamental knowledge that must be possessed for studying education is necessarily social science knowledge. The reason for this is very clear. As mentioned above, the evolution of education is determined by a certain social productive force and production relations, so how do social productive force and production relations develop? Also, how is mental labor separated from physical labor? These are social science questions. If there is no deep understanding of these basic questions, it cannot be hoped that there will be any correct understanding of education. What should be particularly noted here is the knowledge of philosophy. Philosophy is the science of human life, the science that tells humans how to recognize material phenomena or psychological phenomena. We often hear educators raise the issues of educational psychology and mass psychology, but these issues cannot be answered by their subjective imagination. Therefore, you should first have a correct worldview, social view, outlook on life, and scientific observation method, and use them to study education in order to obtain correct conclusions. Here, we can introduce a book for preliminary study, which is the "Outline of New Education" edited by Li Haowu (published by Nanqiang Bookstore). This book can give readers a new understanding of education to some extent.</p>
<p>Then let's talk about the practical aspect. This is indeed a more difficult question to answer. The abolition of education and the emergence of new education integrated with production will inevitably have to wait until the new social system is on track. At this awkward time, it is not possible to go with the flow, and it is also useless to shout high-sounding slogans. What should those engaged in education do? We believe that the first thing to remember is that our education should always be a driving force for promoting social development, and should always be a motivator for enlightening the masses to learn on their own. Standing on this position, we begin our educational work. We can be teachers, whether in primary and secondary schools, or in literacy schools in factories and rural areas, but we will definitely not just be for life, not just shouting high-sounding slogans. We should understand the masses of students, and we should find the source of their distress in the real lives of the masses of students, and arouse their interest in reading and life. For example, the general vulgar educators now are suppressing the development of students' intelligence, but we are going to increase the development of students' intelligence and instill them with new knowledge as much as possible.</p>
<p>Our words end here, which is of course very insufficient, but if the readers can understand this clearly and use it as a starting point for studying education, it will naturally not be completely useless! (End)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shoujuan</p>
<p>However, she was indeed getting old; at that time, she was approaching seventy years old. Her face, her fingers, revealed the signs of old age like ordinary old women; but if someone bluntly said she was old, she could not help but be very annoyed and considered it a major insult.</p>
<p>"…Furthermore, they shouldn't say," she continued to mutter to herself, her anger gradually rising, "because there are things to be done here, we can't leave Beijing! Don't they even know that wherever our people go, the entire court will follow, and everything can still be done as usual? Like during the Boxer Rebellion in the year of Gengzi, when we went to Xi'an, the foreign soldiers couldn't keep up; and our court was still in our hands! Don't they even understand this? What do we need such stupid things for!"</p>
<p>Thus, the Empress Dowager's Eastern Tour was decided. The Imperial Astronomical Bureau picked a very auspicious date and time for our departure. On this day, the Forbidden City was filled with a frenzied and busy atmosphere, from Li Lianying to the lowest-ranking palace maids; from the ruling ministers to the smallest railway servants; from the Empress Dowager and her retinue to us, the attending ladies-in-waiting: everyone was equally busy.</p>
<p>Of course, the entire road from the court gate to the railway station had to be covered with a layer of yellow sand as usual; this yellow sand was soaked very wet, like the beaches by the sea, in order to prevent it from being blown away by the wind. As soon as we left the gate of the Forbidden City, we all got into sedan chairs: my sedan chair happened to be right behind the Empress Dowager's imperial carriage. We passed through the Zhonghua Gate, the Qianmen Gate, along Qianmen Street, all the way to Yongding Gate; that's where we boarded the train. (11)</p>

<p>— Xiong Wan</p>
<p>Every time I pass Tongji Road, I always see that rectangular, whitewashed grave in a field by the road; on it are four large black characters: "Grave of Nomura," and a few small characters next to it: "×× Division Propaganda Group." Seeing it, the lingering images of the war in February of the previous year immediately appear before my eyes: my nose seems to still be filled with the smell of blood. And in my heart? It feels like I'm suffering a great shame.</p>
<p>However, the four characters faded day by day, and finally disappeared completely in these continuous days of spring rain. When I passed this road again today, the white realm was already a purely white grave. Lush green grass and golden little flowers grow all around. The fragrance radiates in waves, truly refreshing and evoking a feeling of "the beauty of early spring."</p>
<p>Who still feels the smell of blood? Who will still imagine the hand-to-hand combat...? What is shame? Everything has been carried away by time; washed clean by the spring rain. Enjoy it! Friends, this "beauty of spring"!</p>

<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>The most exquisite porcelain comes from the Kangxi and Qianlong eras of the late Qing Dynasty. In later generations, only the Hongxian era, when he deliberately sought refinement when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, was comparable to the ancient porcelain of Guyuexuan. Researchers of ancient porcelain generally know this. Ge Jun Zufeng of Pinghu is good at calligraphy and painting and has a rich collection. He especially collects porcelain. Last summer, while recuperating in Lushan, he met He Xuren, a famous porcelain painting master from Nanling. Seeing the landscape on the porcelain screen he painted, it was exquisitely detailed and peerless. The snow scene was especially wonderful and divine, surpassing the painting templates of the Northern Song Dynasty Painting Academy, unprecedented, and breathtaking. Contemporary celebrities were honored to obtain one. Ge and He became friends for more than a month, often discussing ancient porcelain, and benefited greatly. He collected everything that could be used for reference for ancient famous porcelain. He said that the difficulty of painting porcelain is far from comparable to paper and silk. The color and glaze are thicker and coarser than glue and lacquer. Outlining is still possible, but dyeing is even more difficult. Moreover, the opening frame of the porcelain is only a few inches, and if you want the mountains and forests to be complete in the landscape, you cannot succeed without meticulous effort. How difficult it is to paint porcelain! He has Ji Kang's habit of not easily putting pen to paper. It takes several months to complete each piece. Most of the works of Xu Ren on the market are painted by his disciples, and Xu Ren occasionally touches them up. It is also heard that Xu Ren is unrestrained, values friendship, and has the demeanor of an elder. He indulges in the scenery and does not seek fame among the princes. He is truly rare and commendable.</p>
<p>Sculpting porcelain did not start today. What I have seen in the past, although skillful, lacked outstanding talent. If it is Xu Shunyuan's carving today, it is like a supernatural work, unique and extraordinary. Ge Jun obtained the rattan plate carved by him, as thin as a hair, the flowers are vivid and lifelike, and the colors are bright. At the Chicago Exposition, the dragon boat he carved was priced at 30,000 US dollars and was obtained by a Westerner. After the closing, he won the highest award, and the Westerners praised him as a unique skill.</p>

<p>These situations were first seen by Zhao Weng. He hid it from Guizhi, but quietly came to Jiang and asked: Dear Madam, I see that your grandniece always seems to be unwell. I want to find a doctor to take her pulse. What do you think? It is best to ask your grandniece. Otherwise, if you invite a doctor, and she doesn't let him see, it would be a joke. Zhao Weng had a pipe in his mouth, smoking one puff after another, but he couldn't help but reveal his teeth and kept laughing. Seeing his situation, Jiang also saw something, so he said: To tell you the truth, I have been worried about her for a while, and I have been watching her appearance, and I have been worried in my heart. If there is good news, then you have not pampered her for nothing. Hearing this, Zhao Weng was even happier, opening his mouth and unable to close it. Jiang also laughed; you are also attentive and see something. However, this child has a really stubborn temper. If you find a doctor again, she will be ashamed, and that's not good either. I think I will pay more attention from now on. For the past two months, the two old people have not had any jokes. Now Zhao Weng is constantly laughing, almost unable to hold the pipe in his mouth. Jiang's eyes were folded with fish tail wrinkles, as if the bursts of joy were surging from the heart straight to the face. Zhao Weng touched his beard and said: Dear Madam, although I am such a big age, after all, men and women are different, I think it is best to let her do less heavy work. Jiang then said: Old man, don't yell first, it's not certain. Let's wait for a while, and talk about it after this matter is clear. Zhao Weng said; although that's what you say, it's better to let her do less heavy work. Jiang laughed; okay, I'll find a chance to tell her, but it's still not good to tell her straight. Zhao Weng couldn't say anything else, just happy. (362)</p>

<p>Mr. A is the general manager of the Suzhou ×× Association. He is born with a lively face, somewhat humorous. When he solicits members every spring, it is as if the spring breeze is on his face. When he sees people, he is very kind, bowing and making gestures, everything is available, and his face is full of smiles, more interesting and humble than the clown in Xiao Fangniu. But once the membership solicitation period of ×× has passed the end date, his face, like the weather in Huangmei season, gradually changes. First, he sees you, showing you a forced smile, then he sees you, staring at you blankly, and later, when the things he hopes for are successful, he sees you, not only not staring at you, but as if showing that he disdains to meet you, walking past you arrogantly. Maybe he thinks that you guys, "not big enjoyers, but small ghosts," who pay three or five yuan to become a member, what's the point? So the result is that he doesn't bother with you anymore. This is the three changes on Mr. A's face. But when next spring comes, his face, like Pei Skaden's performance, changes to Laurel and Hardy. Not only does he stare at you and smile, but sometimes when he sees you, Mr. So-and-so is long, Mr. So-and-so is short, flattering enough, his face full of smiles, making you feel more comfortable than the people who scrub your back in the bathhouse. His face comes with the spring breeze. I can't name it, so I call it: "Social Face."</p>

<p>When a doctor goes on a house call, he always has to busy himself organizing a bag | called a medicine bag.</p>
<p>When a teacher goes to class, he also has to carry a bag | called a leather bag. It should really be called a book bag.</p>
<p>Of course, the medicine bag is filled with medicine. Medicine can certainly "save lives," but at the same time, it can also "take lives"!</p>
<p>The leather bag is filled with books. The books that can be taught are certainly mostly good, but it depends on how they are taught. If they are not taught well, the result is also equal to "taking lives"!</p>

<p>— A Bored Guest</p>
<p>General Overview of Chengni Inkstones</p>
<p>(3) Ancient Bricks as a Type of Chengni: The above describes genuine Chengni inkstones. There is also a type of ancient brick called Chengni inkstone. Tang Tongyuan said of Chengni inkstones: “Baoshan in Tongzhou, Jiangnan, is also said to have Chengni inkstones. These are all made by locals from the sandy soil of Dachuan Sha and Xiaochuan Sha Huangyao and other places on the seashore, who dig up brick pieces. Some say that Lord Chunshen Huang Xie opened a kiln to make Chengni pottery here, hence the name Huangyao. However, from the Warring States period to now, it has been almost three thousand years, even if there was such a thing, how could broken bricks and pieces still remain today? It must be due to confusion with the Huangyao of the Ming Hongwu period. In the early years of Hongwu, Baoshan and Wusong were built as outer cities, and pottery was made at Huangyao, taking the fine, firm mud near the water of the beach to make bricks. At that time, the broken and discarded pieces were dumped on the beach. When the Baoshan city walls were submerged in the sea, the decaying walls and broken battlements were washed to the sea by waves and flowing sand, staying in the sea for many years, the fire nature completely disappeared. Locals obtained them and used them as inkstones, which did happen, but good ones were extremely rare. Merchants, officials, and gentry did not examine them carefully. Hearing that Tongzhou produced Chengni inkstones, they came to buy them. Every year in the third month, the Langshan incense pilgrimage and market gathering below the mountain were filled with stalls claiming to sell Chengni inkstones to deceive people. Passing guests could not distinguish the real from the fake and bought them at high prices, but they were actually made by stealing stone from Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou or searching for relatively old and fine bricks by the sea to imitate them." From this, it can be proven that the ancient city bricks of Baoshan in Tongzhou were also used as Chengni inkstones during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. Not only were the ancient city bricks of Baoshan in Tongzhou used as Chengni inkstones, but all ancient brick inkstones that could not be investigated were also called Chengni inkstones.</p>
<p>I have a duck-herding old man (Song Luo) bequeathed inkstone, Shao Changheng titled "Song Pit Rose Five-Color Chengni Inkstone", his postscript says, "Future generations discussing this inkstone, all consider it a Song pit Chengni, because Mr. Ran first made an inkstone, knowing it was to be treasured, but in reality, it is an old brick from the Qin and Han dynasties, unearthed in the Song dynasty." The duck-herding old man himself inscribed, "Dongpo Layman said that Chengni inkstones are divided into five colors, those from the Qin and Han dynasties are all red, which are of the highest quality, others are not as good. I have obtained this and can compare it to Juxuan jade."</p>
<p>I also have a wife Meixianguan inkstone, also known as a rose-purple Chengni inkstone, but on the side, the Yu Daoren inscribed: "Kunming robbery ash burns undead, coming out of the water still shines like electric purple, yin and yang furnace coal applies craftsmanship, but one knows not when was it molded, Xianyang one torch of fire virtue arises, no ruins of the Han family palace remain, to this day even an inch of soil is still precious, a thousand years of vastness mourn the Qing history, presenting alas the ancients underground cannot be awakened, ask of the traces of the Guan Chengzi," this is clearly saying it is an ancient brick from the Qin and Han dynasties.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Chengni and ancient bricks were still not clearly distinguished by previous people, no wonder today's market appraisers randomly speak nonsense. In fact, Chengni and ancient bricks, if a little research is done, are easily distinguished. The manufacturing of Chengni is particularly fine and smooth. Even in terms of color, the red of its rose-purple is ultimately different from the red of fire-robbed bricks. Moreover, good Chengni often has interspersed shades of blue and yellow, and there are bean-sized sand, mung bean sand, halo of the moon, needle-tip silver stars, and other kinds of patterns, while ancient bricks do not have this type.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Talking About Writing <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Li</p>
<p>Recently, it seems that many writers are discussing how to write. Some say to use quotations, others say to go to the streets. In fact, these can all be considered tedious, dispensable.</p>
<p>What is important is the thought, that is, the content of the article. Writing an article for the sake of writing an article is completely unnecessary. Of course, if there is something to say, one should try to say it in a way that moves the listener, and should have considerable skill. The writings of Berne and Shaw are vast and boundless, but claiming to be art for art's sake is not enough to move their writing one iota. The reason why they produce excellent articles is that they add a layer of sugar coating to bitter medicine, making it easier for the taker to swallow.</p>
<p>An article without content, even if it is written very beautifully, is of no use to the reader. Fleeting glimpses can never move people. Moreover, it is not easy to write. Just as speaking always expresses one's own opinion, how difficult is it to speak without one's own opinion?</p>
<p>When substance outweighs style, it becomes rustic; when style outweighs substance, it becomes vulgar. What is sought is to have "substance and style perfectly balanced." Ordinary writing practice is not for the sake of writing, but rather like practicing speaking, so that when there is something to say, it is easy to say, convenient to say. The purpose of "writing" is at most like this. And when one is eloquent, at this time, like light, like electricity, like the Yangtze River, the beauty of yang and strength, the beauty of yin and gentleness... all depends on the listener's association.</p>
<p>But it is rare to see articles with substance. Since the May Fourth Movement, there has been no shortage of people who can write, but many articles lack substance, resulting in emptiness. Even composing about the wind and moon requires one's own personality and thought, only then can the wind and moon be sentimental. Saying that young people's faces must be "pale," that the sky must be "azure," or that "heartstrings tremble," or "fists clench," all fall into the old trap of "writing for the sake of writing."</p>
<p>The number of people in front of our eyes who seem to write effortlessly is few, and even fewer can be said to have content. Many people wield guns and sticks, but have no unique skills, and only end up wandering in the world, dividing themselves into "Beijing school" and "Shanghai school," seeking small livelihoods. It truly makes one "suddenly look back and shed tears, grieving that there are no women on the high hill!" It is a pity that in the past seven or eight years, many young people who could write have either abandoned themselves to despair and become monsters, or have disappeared due to special reasons, and are now all silent. This is the fault of the environment and must be specially assigned to the heads of "scholars," "officials," and "gentlemen."</p>

<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Entering the mountain for a mile or two, the terrain gradually rises. The mountain path is winding and tortuous, following a stream between the two peaks. On one side is a clear stream, on the other is a sheer cliff. Where the cliff is steep, halfway up the mountain, the four characters "Linglong Wonderland" are engraved. Further up is Dongpo's Drunken Sleeping Stone and the Nine-Bend Cliff. The ruins of the Three-Rest Pavilion are probably also in this Niushan Mountain. The number of cliff carvings is countless. It is a pity that this mountain is all sandy rock, and the weathering is severe, so most of the stone carvings are no longer recognizable. The most wonderful thing is Su Dongpo's Drunken Sleeping Stone, on the west side of the mountain stream, on the east side of the road under the stone wall, a long square stone, lying horizontally, can accommodate the length of one person's body, truly like a stone sofa. Whether Dongpo actually slept drunk on this stone or not, let's not worry about it, but the three characters on the stone, and the three characters "Nine-Bend Cliff" on the rock wall not far from this stone, as well as the poem "When did two ancient dragons stand stiffly?", are said to be Dongpo's writing; I am not an archeological epigrapher, I privately think that it is better to pretend to recognize these ancient sites as genuine, and to fake elegance is ultimately more interesting than burning the zither to cook a crane. Also, to the east of the Drunken Sleeping Stone, there is also a rock, standing horizontally by the stream, with the two seal characters "Appreciating Zither Sound" engraved on it, presumably because the flowing water makes a zither-like sound, a clever double entendre with the Zither Cao Tomb just above it, and because I cannot bear to bury the author's painstaking effort, I mention it here.</p>
<p>Following the stream and touching the wall, ascending another fifty or sixty steps, passing the Hejian Spring, to a flat area below the top of the mountain, there is a road that winds south to the foot of a branch peak on the west side. Following the road south, to a protruding flat area, probably the old site of the Shoujuan Pavilion. Sitting here and looking south, the mountains and fields far and near are within sight, and the open space can accommodate three or four hundred people. On the north side of the open space, where the mountain peak has been cut away, a stone overhang remains, covering three ancient stone carvings below, said to be the posthumous portraits of Dongpo, Buddha Seal, and Shangu, probably the place where Chu Dong of the Ming dynasty said he obtained the portraits in a dream and built a monument for them, and also the site of the remaining pavilion recorded by Huang Dingxiang of the Ming dynasty, all in this area. It is commonly mistaken for the Three-Rest Pavilion, even mistakenly as the Three-Sage Shrine, undoubtedly all misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Gazing from under the stone overhang for a long time, I still followed the original road north and east, passing a monument pavilion in a vegetable garden, and went to the Linglong Mountain Temple to rest. After sitting for a while and drinking a bowl of tea, I followed the old monk to the top of the east peak, and after passing the bell tower, I arrived at Zither Cao's tomb. A desolate mound of earth, a rough stone tablet, with only the three large characters "Zither Cao's Tomb" engraved on it. Flipping through the new and old Lin'an County Chronicles, there is no record of Zither Cao's deeds, but it says that the tomb is east of the temple, only Feng Mengzhen's poem "Zither Cao's Tomb":</p>
<p>The strings are silent, wet with dew, in the depths of white clouds, a cold kasaya, where are the golden bones of the three springs, a night of west wind sweeps away the fallen flowers. I copy it here, to cover the shame of the compilers of the Lin'an County Chronicle.</p>
<p>Fellow traveler Pan Guangdan is a researcher of Feng Xiaoqing, and Lin Yutang is a passionate lover of Li Xiangjun in the Peach Blossom Fan. When everyone arrived at Zither Cao's tomb, they all became indignant and said that the compilers of the Lin'an County Chronicle were completely ignorant. Yutang even concocted a story from "A Rustic's Idle Talk", and said with impassioned words:</p>
<p>"Guangdan, you go and repair Feng Xiaoqing's tomb, I intend to repair Li Xiangjun's tomb, this Zither Cao's tomb, you can only let you repair it."</p>
<p>As he spoke, his eyes were fixed on us, the so-called you referring to us. Because of this piece of nonsense, I wrote four lines of doggerel:</p>
<p>The mountain is exquisite, the water is clear, Dongpo once visited Yunying here, why do the eight volumes of the Lin'an Chronicle not record a segment of Zither Cao's feelings.</p>
<h3 id="e190">On Looking at Cockroach-like People with Contempt <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Brother Lie Wen:</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Rong sighs that the world is what it is, but I am sighing about who is in the world? If there were only people like Ye Rong in the world, then there would only be great articles. In a prosperous age, they would yield in the royal court and sing praises of the sage's virtue. In a chaotic world, they would only be filled with impassioned sighs. There would inevitably be those who are good at using the nation, either relatively silent, or loudly shouting, or initiating kneeling petitions demanding unpaid wages, or organizing destruction groups to demonstrate against weak women. I can grow old and die without interacting with such people. But such people have existed since ancient times, there is nothing to be surprised about. The Analects has long been despised by such people, and the world will inevitably be looked at with contempt by such people, it is all within expectations. Because Mr. Jin Rong writes in vernacular, he deeply hates the airs of the literati and is no different from the literati who opposed vernacular and maintained traditional orthodoxy in the past. Mr. Jin Rong values "the universe" and despises "cockroaches", but I despise the universe and like to talk about cockroaches. If you ask what is there to talk about cockroaches, please read the first issue of "The World of People", "Jin Shengtan's Extreme Micro-Essays". People who do not understand this article will definitely look at cockroaches with contempt. There are many such people in the world. So Mr. Jin Rong's article says "Now I only see a few cockroaches", as if a few words are enough to devalue the worth of the "World of People". However, I know that cockroaches will not stop entering essays because of the contempt of Mr. Jin Rong. Essays will not lessen its charm because of the contempt of Mr. Jin Rong. Mr. Jin Rong can open his eyes wide to see it. What Mr. Jin Rong likes to talk about is the world and people's hearts, but if the world and people's hearts are not started from the micro details. They are often talked about until dizzy and do not know what they are talking about. Reading it, it has quite a bit of ups and downs, but when a microscope is used, it makes people laugh. If my brother does not believe, there is the following article as proof. Mr. Jin Rong said that although Zhou Zuoren is good at writing essays, he has not been able to write novels. Lu Xun did not write essays before he wrote excellent novels, hoping to prove that my saying "the creation of excellent novels comes from the training of essays" is wrong. What follows is a new stereotype:</p>
<p>"If you say that there is another reason, that is to exaggerate and steal the name of the essay. If you say that it is true, that is the publisher is acting against his heart and deceiving the world."</p>
<p>Although the two words "if" are used quite vigorously, the two assumptions are both related or contradictory, I am afraid that the author is not very clear, but he wants to use this to be able to match "acting against his heart and deceiving the world" with "exaggerating and stealing the name". It can be seen that if people do not start from the small and micro places, the world and people's hearts will often be unable to talk through.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Rong said that "personal infatuation with playing things, sketching lightly, this is the essay". This is very representative of the new moralistic viewpoint. Is this not much different from the general literati's views that previously advocated "essays" and now oppose "essays" one after another?</p>
<h3 id="e191">Obsession <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>The intersection was full of people, as if surrounding something, everyone formed a circle, tiptoeing and craning their necks, looking forward.</p>
<p>"What are they looking forward to?"</p>
<p>I also inserted my head into a gap. There was nothing strange, an old woman beggar was feeding two dogs. It wasn't strange, but it was a little strange. Everyone said that beggars are stingy, otherwise, why would they pick out all the better parts of the hard-earned food to feed these two animals, while they only eat the leftovers, making the dogs as fat as clay figures while the person is thinner than dry firewood. Some women whispered that the old beggar must owe these two dogs in her previous life.</p>
<p>The real situation is really difficult to make people look at it normally. The old woman was wearing a body of rags, one piece hanging over another. Her face was haggard, and she kept chewing food and sending it to the mouths of the two dogs, while constantly muttering, this mutter was like a kind of comfort. The two dogs, one white and one black, had glossy fur, each with a red ribbon tied around its neck, their heads turned up towards her, constantly wagging their tails, and humming a kind of sound in their mouths, like love. Finally, the old woman left, with the two dogs following her, one on each side.</p>
<p>I often think that life is nothing else, it is "obsession", "obsession" is the quality of life! What you are "obsessed" with may seem unworthy to others, then you should not care about these things. Only when you reach the point of "not being discouraged even if the whole world disapproves" can you be considered truly "obsessed". Perhaps "obsession" to the extreme is "greatness". "Obsession" is "singleness of thought" as if Marx said that the only way to his success was "singleness of thought".</p>
<p>This old woman beggar can also be said to be "obsessed" with these two dogs, right?</p>

<h3 id="e193">Ghosts of the Past <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Feng</p>
<p>Among those who were once "literary youths" ten years ago, there are probably some who still remember the blind poet Eroshinko. Although he shouted that our country was a "desert" after drifting from Japan, after all, after a storm of the "May Fourth Movement," many young people were dreaming while looking at the blue sky, creating smiles in their troubles, so his "Peach-Colored Clouds" and "Fairy Tales" were embraced by our pure hearts, increasing the courage that was indispensable to those who were groping in the dark.</p>
<p>But there is another thing that I often remember with a different feeling, which is his lecture called "Ghosts of the Past". The content was translated by Mr. Zhou Zuoren, who was standing at the forefront of the new literary movement at the time, saying that in you (the Chinese youths at the time) there are still many "ghosts of the past" living, who will run out from time to time, and encourage you to do things according to their wishes. This is very simple, but when said by him in that poetic way, it was simply vivid and captured us, making us even look back warily when we were walking on the road. Why did he give such a lecture that made us young people feel a little eerie? Of course, the reason cannot be known exactly, but now thinking about it, it is nothing more than that although he was blind and could not see, the dark force accumulated by this ancient country for thousands of years pressed on him with a gloomy breath, making him feel like he was about to suffocate, so he had to shout to the young people whose faces were slightly showing a new rosiness.</p>
<p>Time has passed, and the fighting youth of today have tempered steel and sensitivity from purity, and Eroshinko has gradually been forgotten. This is as it should be.</p>
<p>However, today I bought a newly published "The World of People" at a bookstall. Before reading the "delightful article" about "the greatness of the universe and the insignificance of cockroaches," I was attracted by the large photograph of Mr. Zhou Zuoren in front and his fiftieth birthday poem. Mr. Zhou made not small efforts in the "May Fourth" literary movement and in introducing foreign literature. When he turned fifty, we might still be willing to take a look at his photo, but what made me speechless were those two poems (not to mention those poems in response). If they were discovered in a collection of "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries", of course, we would slap the table and exclaim at such a "perfected" seven-character regulated verse. However, this author is the author of "Little River" who once fought for the liberation of poetry, and now the author who "talks about foxes and ghosts" and "listens to talk about ghosts all day long in the streets," but enthusiastically translated "Ghosts of the Past" for us back then.

<p>Beating spring,</p>
<p>Barefoot running,</p>

<p>Only hate that you can't run far in the fields,</p>

<p>Even if you are well-behaved,</p>
<p>They dare to pull you over;</p>
<p>Don't know what is being chewed (note 2) in the mouth</p>
<p>Can't not listen, but listening makes the face red</p>
<p>Just have to secretly be downwind,</p>

<p>— Wang Yue</p>
<p>But life refuses to let anyone off easily. Moreover, life itself is a kind of strength and wisdom. Like the small grass under the rock, the small grass of life also stubbornly and cleverly finds its way to survive under the rock of the present society. With sores, she began to parade through this city. Shaking a small tin can, emitting mournful sounds to beg. In front of the foreign devils, she raised her hand to salute, speaking foreign pidgin. She courted the waiters in the packed-lunch shops for food. She once mingled with the crowd of refugees, falsely claiming that she was an escapee from the disaster area, and entered the relief center. But there was nothing but beatings, scoldings, and lack of freedom, and no relief. Perhaps it was because of this that she soon ran away again like a prisoner escaping from prison.</p>
<p>What followed was still aimless wandering, begging between the streets and the tram stations, providing materials to illustrate the nature of our existing civilization. Moving from the main street to this remote residential area was something that happened later. Those living here were traveling salesmen and small workers from companies, unemployed clerks, and barbers. Life was meager and monotonous, with only a little vitality on Sundays and at dusk. People drank cheap wine, set up square tables in the alleys to play mahjong, and strummed the erhu. Hiring servants was an extravagant fantasy in their lives; they didn't even have a doorman guarding the alley. But labor without a price, or labor with a low price, is rarely refused.</p>
<p>As wages, they only gave a little leftover cold rice and dishes that had already gone bad. To her, this was already very satisfying. Because it was no more suitable for a person's appetite than begging, and because of the fixed supply from many families, she was no longer starving. Moreover, she would occasionally have leftovers to satisfy her sympathy for other suffering people, or save them up, and when she was bored, like people eating snacks, she would take them out to pass the time. Because all the work was concentrated in the morning and at noon, and the alley was not wide, such boring time was common. But more often, she was either lazily sweeping the alley that didn't need to be swept again, or dragging the bamboo broom, pacing back and forth on the cement floor, letting the tattered men's leather shoes make a lonely tune.</p>

<p>In the second battle of the National Basketball Preliminary Round last night, Shanghai defeated Nanjing with the most beautiful and clear passing, by a score of 33 to 21. Shanghai's five tigers were able to maintain their original state, fully demonstrating their respective strengths, being brave and vigorous, but without any animosity. The entire team played as one, forcing the tenacious Nanjing team to admit defeat. Looking at Shanghai's performance last night, why did they not beat Hubei the night before? Taking things lightly and taking the lead, it was a pity. Tonight, Hubei will face Nanjing, and Hubei will likely win.</p>

<p>The situation in the first half was</p>
<p>very tense, with the score fluctuating back and forth, making it difficult to tell who would win. Shanghai's lead was only five points at most. At the end of the first half, they only led by 13 to 11, a difference of only two points. In the second half, Lu Zhongen went forward to help the battle, and Chen Xianglong was like a fierce tiger out of its cage, each making contributions. As a result, Nanjing's formation was chaotic and could not recover. The largest difference in the score was 29 to 27. The Nanjing team was trapped in tight defense and had no opportunity. In terms of coordination, they were not as good as the Shanghai team.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Shanghai Takes the Lead by Two Points <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>After initial contact,</p>
<p>Shanghai frequently committed fouls, so Nanjing opened the scoring with free throws. After a long struggle, Qian Jingyong scored a free throw, leading 3 to 2. Sun Baoqing continued to contribute, and Qian Jingyong added two more points, making it 7 to 2, putting Nanjing at a disadvantage. Trying to improve, Zhang Changqing and Liu Mengjiu caught up with three points. Relying on Qian's efforts, Shanghai soon made it 9 to 4. Nanjing gradually expanded its offensive and showed promise, making it 9 to 9, and then 11 to 11. Both sides were poor at long-range shooting, also because the light was dazzling. Both sides fought fiercely. Lu Zhongen's goal created a 13 to 11 victory.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Nanjing Utterly Helpless <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the Shanghai team</p>
<p>Had smooth sailing, were consistently successful, and if there was no opportunity, they resolutely did not seek petty advantages. They relied on coordination and clever tactics, achieving unexpected victories. Their score soared, while the City of Nanjing suffered losses. In an instant, the score became 23 to 13, a difference of ten points. Nanjing changed their formation, but there was still no improvement. Chen Xianglong broke free of his constraints and scored three times in a row, making it 29 to 17, and then 31 to 19. At this point, the Shanghai team fully displayed their strengths, maximizing their coordination. In the end, Shanghai won with a score of 33 to 21. Referees were Zhang Guoxun and Jin Zhaojun.</p>

<p>Nanjing will play against Hubei. This is the final act of the round-robin tournament. If Nanjing wins against Hubei, then the three teams will remain evenly matched. If Hubei wins against Nanjing, they will win the round-robin tournament and play against the North China team in the final. If the three teams tie, perhaps a mixed team will be formed to play against North China. However, based on their respective strengths, Nanjing is probably no match for Hubei.

<h3 id="e225">After Failure of Pseudo-Organization Participation, Japan Decides to Participate in Far Eastern Games - Recognizing that Sports Diplomacy Situation Worsens After Withdrawal <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Proposes Amendment of Charter when the Games are Held in the Philippines</p>
<p>Pseudo-Organization's Ambition to Participate in the Next Far Eastern Games Undimmed</p>
<p>(China United Press, Tokyo, 15th) After the Japanese Athletic Association received a reply from the Philippine Athletic Association last night, it convened a full meeting of its executives at the Chuo-Tei in the Marunouchi district at 9 PM, attended by 41 people. The meeting did not adjourn until 1:30 AM today. During the meeting, there were many who advocated a hard-line stance. Advisor Sugimura Yotaro repeatedly explained the advantages and disadvantages of withdrawing from the Far Eastern Games in relation to diplomacy, which led the atmosphere of the entire meeting and resulted in a decision to attend the Far Eastern Games. At 3 AM, two telegrams were sent, one to the Philippine Athletic Association and the other to the Manchurian Athletic Association. The telegram to the Philippines briefly stated, "The issue of the pseudo-Manchurian participation has ended in failure, but it is regrettable for the sake of harmony among Asian nations. We propose that the representatives of the three countries gather in Manila during the Games to amend the Far Eastern Games charter." The intention is still to allow pseudo-Manchuria to participate in the next Games.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Process of Deciding to Participate <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 15th) The plenary meeting of the Japanese Athletic Association, which had to decide on its final attitude regarding participation in the Far Eastern Games, convened yesterday at 8:30 PM at the Chuo-Tei in Marunouchi, with heated discussions and repeated twists. Honorary President Kano also attended the meeting at 10:30 PM. Other influential figures such as Vice President Hiranuma, Honorary Director Go, and Advisor Sugimura were all actively involved. As a result, the argument for participating in the Far Eastern Games gradually gained strength. At midnight on the 15th, a unanimous decision was made to participate in the 10th Far Eastern Games, while also addressing the issue of reforming the association. At 2:00 AM on the 15th, a response document to the Philippines was released, and the meeting adjourned. With this, the so-called sports diplomacy issue gradually escaped the crisis and came to a conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Reply Telegram to the Philippines <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 15th) The Japanese Athletic Association sent the following reply to the Philippine Athletic Association: "We have received your telegram of April 14 and understood all the details. The Greater Japan Athletic Association has worked with your association over the years on the Far Eastern Games with the sole intention of promoting the spirit of sports in the Far East and enhancing the friendship among the youth of Asian nations. Therefore, the Association has always strived to handle various issues related to the Games with a clear and loving spirit. Regarding the issue of the pseudo-organization athletic association participating in the Far Eastern Games, we have also disclosed our sincerity to the authorities based on this spirit. However, we regret that our true intentions have not been fully understood. Nevertheless, our Association fully understands the difficult position of the Philippines on this issue and expresses our deep sympathy. In particular, we appreciate the statement in your telegram that your association only seeks to promote the sportsmanship and friendship of all countries in the Far East. We respectfully express our appreciation for this. Therefore, our Association has decided to approach the Far Eastern Games with the above attitude in order to respond to your trust and friendship. We will explain the participation issue of the pseudo-organization athletic association based on your sincerity and propose a resolution at the General Assembly regarding the constitution issue. We are now pleased to decide to participate in this Games, which your association has advocated, and we are deeply gratified. When we feel Japan's responsibility for the pseudo-organization is significant, we will be patient and discreet and seek a solution in good faith. Respectfully, we hope for your understanding."</p>
<h3 id="e228">Statement by the Japanese Athletic Association <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 15th) The Japanese Athletic Association issued a statement under the name of Vice President Hiranuma, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The Greater Japan Athletic Association's strong advocacy for the participation of the pseudo-organization in the Far Eastern Games is entirely based on the essence of sports and the spirit of the Far Eastern Games. It is simply impossible to refuse participation to those who possess the actual ability to participate in the competition and who desire to do so themselves. To gladly allow them to participate is a fair and just action, which is a natural course of events in the spirit of sports. However, the process and outcome of this meeting have been constrained by the imperfect existing constitution, resulting in fruitless discussions and even despair, which is deeply regrettable. Now, according to the telegram from the Philippine Athletic Association, the organizer of the 10th Far Eastern Games, it is stated that they are abandoning all political considerations. Its spirit and purpose are not contrary to the attitude and position of this Association; only its method of argument is slightly different. This Association feels that it is necessary to reciprocate its trust and goodwill and to fulfill the aspirations of the pseudo-organization athletic association. This Association should maintain its position as a pillar of the Games and strive to persuade the neighboring associations as much as possible. Furthermore, we feel obligated to express friendship and courtesy to the two new allies, Annam and the Dutch East Indies, who are joining this Games. Therefore, this statement is to declare that we will participate in the sports Games held in Manila as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Tuberculosis and Socioeconomic Status (Part 1) <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Weng Zhilong</p>
<p>Tuberculosis has a close relationship with the nation and society. This disease is also called the "disease of the poor." Generally, the poorer the socioeconomic conditions of a society, the more poor people there are. The more poor people there are, the more tuberculosis there is. Why is this? Because of poor economic conditions, there is bound to be poor diet, poor living conditions, and poor mental state, making it easier for tuberculosis to occur. Poor people who get sick have no money to treat it, so they become poorer and sicker, beyond help. This is being sick because of poverty. Conversely, the more tuberculosis there is, the poorer the society's economy will be. Because there are more people with tuberculosis, they cannot work and will inevitably become unemployed. Every unemployed person in the country means one more person taking resources and one less person producing them. Under these circumstances, how can the economy of the country and society not suffer great losses? Therefore, the sicker one is, the poorer one becomes. This is being poor because of sickness. Thus, the poorer one is, the sicker one becomes, and the sicker one is, the poorer one becomes. If this cycle continues, the people will be sick, and the national strength will decline, making it easy for the nation to perish. Therefore, to save the country and cure the nation's illness, it is necessary to first cure the illness of the people. Everyone must understand that if the people are healthy, their productivity will naturally be strong. With high productivity, the economic conditions of the country and society can naturally improve. As the saying goes, "The wealth of the people is the wealth of the society and the nation." This is a natural consequence. Therefore, it can be seen that the relationship between tuberculosis and socioeconomic status is very deep. Furthermore, in our country, the number of people who die from tuberculosis each year is more than tens of thousands, and the losses to the people and the nation are more than millions of yuan. Because there are no detailed statistics, it is impossible to report an accurate percentage, which is very regrettable and very worrying. We must find a way to remedy this.</p>
<p>As far as I know, within five years since 1906, the losses suffered by the city of Berlin, Germany, due to the deaths of people from tuberculosis were approximately 133 trillion marks per year. Adding the loss of productivity due to death, the total loss was approximately 150 trillion marks, for a total loss of 380 trillion marks. From this, it can be seen that the losses suffered by their country in just one city due to illness were already so enormous. However, according to Moller's calculations, due to effective prevention in recent years, tuberculosis has decreased, and the country's losses have been reduced to more than one hundred trillion marks. From this, it can be seen that promoting the prevention of tuberculosis is protecting the lives and property of the people, and it is also creating wealth for the nation and maintaining its vitality. The mortality rate from tuberculosis among Chinese people is even higher than in other countries, so it can be inferred that China's property losses are even greater, making tuberculosis prevention work particularly important.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is also known as tubercle bacillus disease. The cause of the disease is mostly infection with tubercle bacillus bacteria. Because of poor socioeconomic conditions, little attention is paid to prevention, and people are infected. From a medical perspective, this disease is not hereditary to descendants, but the descendants of tuberculosis patients are generally not very healthy and are easily infected or develop other diseases. This is because of weak resistance!</p>
<p>For example, Weiu berg's report on the mortality statistics of infants in the city of Stuttgart, Germany, from 1873 over a period of 30 years:</p>
<p>Out of every 100 infants, the death rate of infants whose fathers had tuberculosis was 46.82</p>
<p>Out of every 100 infants, the death rate of infants whose mothers had tuberculosis was 48.11</p>
<p>Out of every 100 infants, the death rate of infants whose fathers did not have tuberculosis was 40.27</p>
<p>Out of every 100 infants, the death rate of infants whose mothers did not have tuberculosis was 40.17</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the descendants of those with tuberculosis are relatively less healthy.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Common Knowledge of Skin Diseases (Part 1) <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Today, I am entrusted by Dr. Wang Wanbai of the Gospel Radio Station to talk about medicine and hygiene. I do not claim to have in-depth research in medicine. If there is anything I can contribute to everyone, it is only from the aspect of skin diseases that I have learned. I will share some very basic common knowledge with everyone.</p>
<p>Before we talk about common knowledge of skin diseases, we must first understand a very important organ. What are its characteristics in terms of anatomy and physiology that allow it to bear such important responsibilities? I will now give a brief explanation of the anatomy of the skin.</p>
<p>The skin, in the eyes of ordinary people, appears to be a very thin layer. However, when a doctor cuts off a piece with an instrument and examines it under a microscope, it can be divided into three layers. The first layer is called the epidermis, the second layer is called the dermis, and the third layer is called the subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis can be roughly divided into two layers. The upper layer is called the stratum corneum, and the lower layer is called the stratum germinativum. The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of our skin, which is yellowish or white and transparent. The stratum germinativum contains a certain amount of pigment. The difference in the color of the world's races lies in the concentration of pigment in this layer. Furthermore, it is in contact with the dermis and has a lymph fluid communication with the lymph fluid of the dermis. Therefore, during inflammation, the lymphocytes in the dermis can reach the epidermis. The second layer is called the dermis. The dermis contains connective tissue cells and elastic fibers. Therefore, the elasticity of the dermis is very high. In addition, there are blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, lymphatic cavities, nerves, nerve endings, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, hair, etc. It is indeed the main part of the skin. The third layer is called the subcutaneous tissue, also called subcutaneous fat tissue. This varies in thickness depending on gender, age, race, and individual health status and is not fixed.</p>
<p>I have roughly explained the anatomy of the skin above. Now I will talk about the physiological functions of the skin. There are many physiological functions of the skin, such as nerve function, secretion, absorption, respiration, body temperature regulation, and protection from various external harms. I will now break them down and explain them.</p>
<p>First, I will talk about nerve function. The sensory nerves of the skin can be divided into four types: touch, temperature, cold, and pain. Each type of sensation has a specialized nerve ending to control it. The skin uses this nerve function to know the various conditions of the outside world and can prevent disasters. For example, by using the temperature nerve, we can know the heat of fire; by using the cold nerve, we can know the coldness of ice; by using the pain nerve, we can know the invasion of knives, swords, and other external harms; and by using the touch nerve, we can know what we are touching. However, the distribution of these four types of nerve endings is not fixed. They vary depending on the location. For example, the fingertips have more touch and pain endings, so touch and pain are also the most sensitive. If the skin did not have this nerve function, great danger could occur. For example, if one did not feel the heat when encountering fire, burns could occur.</p>
<p>Second, I will talk about the secretory function of the skin. The skin has sweat glands and sebaceous glands. Sweat glands can secrete sweat, and sebaceous glands can secrete oil to lubricate the skin. If there is too much or too little secretion, it will turn into various diseases, such as seborrhea, lack of sebum, and acne. The main function of sweating is to excrete excess water from the body to replace the function of the kidneys. Furthermore, because of the evaporation of water, it can reduce the temperature of the skin and blood, lowering the body temperature. Sweating more in summer uses the evaporation of sweat to take away the body's temperature. It is indeed a very important method of body temperature regulation.</p>
<p>Third, body temperature regulation. Eighty percent of the heat dissipated from the body is released from the skin, which uses the contraction and expansion of its blood vessels. For example, in cold weather, the skin's blood vessels contract, reducing heat dissipation, so the skin is mostly pale white in cold weather (redness and swelling from frostbite is an exception). In hot weather, the skin's blood vessels expand, increasing heat dissipation, so the skin is mostly red and flushed in hot weather. Isn't that a very clever arrangement? Moreover, the skin uses the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of its epidermis, to resist high external temperatures. You see, during the hot summer, carters run barefoot on the scorching ground. On the one hand, it can also prevent excessive heat dissipation. Patients with extensive burns who have their skin peeled off are prone to weakness due to excessive heat dissipation.</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Those who speak about national affairs today often sigh that there is a lack of talent. Is there really a lack of talent? It is that there is talent but it is not known how to use it. Chu did not use Miao Ben and fled to Jin, and Yu did not use Baili Xi and entered Qin. China has talent, but other countries use it. From ancient times to the present, it is the same old story. It is regrettable. Dr. Liu Yongchun studied bacteriology in France for eight years. At the Pasteur Institute in Paris, he once returned to China, but he crossed over to other countries again due to lack of opportunities. He was hired by the Pasteur Institute in Saigon, where he was in charge of BCG vaccine production. He concentrated on his studies, devoted himself to research, and achieved great results. He is a well-known expert, but the people of his own country do not yet know him. Now, he has returned to the country temporarily to visit his beloved mother. During our conversations, my admiration deepened. My relationship with him is not only one of kinship but also one of classmates. Throughout my life, I have admired him, and he is indeed a person worthy of admiration. If we are talking about talent, he should be the first choice. Nowadays, the prevention of tuberculosis is on everyone's mind, and the production of BCG requires an expert. Therefore, I am acting on the principle of impartiality and introducing him to the people of the country. Do not let useful talent be lost in a foreign land.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Discussion on the Marriageable Age <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>Marriage is the most important and essential stage in the process of human life; no one can deny this, except for those who advocate religious asceticism.</p>
<p>The maintenance of human life depends on the reproduction of both sexes, and marriage is the way to achieve reproduction. Therefore, marriage is not only a personal matter but also an important task in human development. If we do not study everything about marriage and marry blindly, the result will inevitably affect the future of human development. Many scholars recognize marriage as a human obligation, and they also use a human perspective to argue this.</p>
<p>The Chinese people, oppressed under a patriarchal society, have been poisoned by the hypocrisy of the old rituals and attach importance to impractical procedures such as "parents' arrangement, six rites accompanying" for the marriage of the two sexes. As for the development of the two sexes and whether or not the marriageable age is appropriate, they have never taken it into consideration. The parents of both sexes have little education and more ignorance. They are dominated by the ancient teachings of "men must marry when they are old, women must marry when they are old" and the medieval concept of carrying on the family line. They want to taste the joy of having grandchildren and quickly complete the marriage of their children to fulfill their life's wishes. As a result, some people find happiness through marriage, while others enter a pessimistic path.</p>
<p>When humans reach the age of fourteen, although there are also those who reach it as early as twelve and as late as seventeen, special changes occur in their bodies. This change is a symbol of the maturity of both sexes, which medicine calls the period of puberty. When males reach this period, their voices become rough and turbid, their appearance tends to be beautified, their bones and flesh become more solid and strong, their bodies develop into beautiful and full forms, and hair grows on the lips, armpits, and other parts, especially the reproductive organs undergo significant changes. The seed of human reproduction, semen, begins to be secreted at this time. When females reach this period, the changes in their bodies are even more significant than those in males: the muscles become plump, the skin becomes smooth, and the beauty of female youth is fully manifested. The breasts and all of the reproductive organs are unusually developed. At the same time, menstruation begins. During puberty, not only do physical changes occur in both sexes, but there are also characteristic changes in the mental aspect. In particular, they know the need for sex, and there is now a clear understanding of the previously vague distinction between the two sexes.</p>
<p>Since the need for sex begins during puberty, the earliness or lateness of puberty is closely related to the age of marriage. Therefore, the marriageable age of people in various countries around the world is determined based on the earliness or lateness of puberty. Generally speaking, people in temperate zones have an earlier puberty and marry earlier. People in cold zones have a later puberty and marry later. In Germany, where medicine is most developed, the civil law stipulates that the marriageable age for males must be over twenty-five and for females over twenty-one. This is also determined based on the age of puberty. As for why women marry earlier than men, this is because women lose their sexuality earlier than men.</p>
<p>Many people advocate marriage at the beginning of puberty. Their reasons are:</p>
<p>(1) Sexual desire is a human instinct and is as important as appetite. It is actually harmless to marry when one knows the need for sex.</p>
<p>(2) Early marriage can eliminate harmful masturbation and nocturnal emission, resulting in a healthier sexuality.</p>
<p>(3) Early marriage can prevent immoral behavior and avoid the danger of venereal disease transmission.</p>
<p>These are indeed considerable reasons and cannot be absolutely denied. However, we should know that although sexual development is complete during puberty, the development of other parts of the body is still ongoing. If we only consider the completeness of sex and disregard other circumstances, we will definitely get the following results.</p>
<p>(1) It will affect the health and development of the body.</p>
<p>(2) Underage men and women have weak wills and cannot restrain excessive sexual desire.</p>
<p>(3) The children born are congenitally deficient and unhealthy, affecting the future of the race.</p>
<p>(4) They are too young and have insufficient knowledge to be role models for their children.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to biology, the marriage of the two sexes should take place after puberty. If they marry before reaching full age, they will inevitably fall into weakness and decline. Not only that, even from a social, economic, and intellectual point of view, early marriage never has good results. While we oppose early marriage, we do not approve of late marriage either, because each has equal harm. We advocate marriage at the appropriate age, preferably for males from twenty-five to thirty years old, and for females four to five years earlier than males. As for masturbation and venereal disease, these are indeed bad behaviors that are harmful to the body, but they can be remedied by sexual education. Parents who grew up under the old rituals think that sexual desire is a dirty and base behavior. This is a false concept. Mr. William Ludson of the United States advocates that children from the ages of ten to thirteen should be taught simple anatomy and physiology of the reproductive organs. From the ages of thirteen to sixteen, they can be explained the dangers of venereal diseases and the harmfulness of masturbation. As for everything that has a seductive instinct, lewd books, lewd pictures, and lewd plays should be strictly prohibited from contacting children. At the same time, try to arouse children's interest in studying and spend the elements that make up their sexual energy on the path of research. So that the instinct of sex can be naturally restrained and melted, this is indeed a good way. Unfortunately, education in our country has not been popularized, and there are many stubborn parents. Who can break the hypocrisy of the rituals and pay attention to sexual education?</p>
<h3 id="e256">A Simple Explanation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (1) <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The disease of tuberculosis has been highly regarded in our country's traditional society! There is a popular saying among the common people, which goes: 'Paralysis, dropsy, and diaphragmatic obstruction are four incurable serious illnesses.' This saying has certainly been passed down from ancient times and contains considerable factual truth. However, we must understand that paralysis, dropsy, and diaphragmatic obstruction are only important symptoms within each disease, and not a disease in themselves. Examples of these types of symptoms occurring in each disease are numerous. Only the word 'consumption' (癆) is different from the others, ultimately representing the disease we call tuberculosis. In a narrow sense, it can also be called by another name, which is the pulmonary consumption (tuberculosis) mentioned in this topic. Looking back, what is the perspective of the modern medical community? They all commonly recognize that tuberculosis, syphilis, and cancer are the three major diseases worldwide. This view is entirely based on facts and is naturally much more insightful than the former. Regarding cancer, its causes and treatments have not yet been concretely determined, so we will leave it aside for now. Syphilis is different; its cause is completely understood, and there are specific drugs for treatment. However, if we observe from the perspective of transmission, the prevention of syphilis transmission is not entirely impossible. It is mostly caused by sexual intercourse with unclean individuals, and hereditary examples are also numerous. Therefore, if these two factors are absent, the risk of its transmission will be better in any case. Tuberculosis is completely different! Its only route of transmission, the reality of inhalation transmission, is difficult to prevent. We must understand that everyone's need for air is more common than 'food and sex'; it is even more important. In other words, one cannot survive without breathing air. Therefore, we can say that no one is not afraid of contracting tuberculosis. On the other hand, if we speculate about the future, modern material civilization is advancing without end. Industrial areas with dense populations and large cities with congested traffic are naturally becoming more and more numerous. However, this kind of development is very beneficial to the spread of tuberculosis. In other words, we can also say that the spread of tuberculosis will also advance without end. Syphilis is somewhat different in this situation because it has specific drugs as a backup, and industrial development is not directly related to it. Therefore, if we compare tuberculosis and syphilis as major enemies of humanity, 'equally outstanding talents' is not a problem. However, in terms of its 'pervasive' and 'advancing without end' transmission, the seat of the eldest brother will probably still have to be given to tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The fact that tuberculosis is a major enemy of humanity and its ease of transmission have already been mentioned somewhat above. So, is there any statistic on those who suffer from this disease? In China, there is no documentation. European scholars answer that those who die from this disease account for one-seventh of the total number of human deaths, but in prosperous cities or industrial areas, it is more than this number. This alarming number is more than any other disease. In Germany, previous reports indicated that no less than 100,000 people die from this disease each year, of which almost 90 percent suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, calculated per 10,000 people, it is an average of about 17 percent in Germany, and 21 percent in Switzerland and France. Furthermore, observed by age, it can occur at any stage. Not to mention the prime of life in the twenties and thirties, there are already deaths from this disease among one- or two-year-old children, and the number of deaths is even greater among older people in their fifties and sixties. This fact can very well prove that the common saying in our country, 'People over forty years old do not contract tuberculosis,' is a misconception. Any of the above mortality figures we randomly pick are very shocking. No wonder the great German pathologist Ascboff exclaimed, 'No one is free from consumption,' a shocking statement.</p>
<h3 id="e257">A Brief Biography of Émile Roux, Director of the Pasteur Institute in France <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Interpreted by Zhu Jiajian, Professor at the Sino-French University in Beiping</p>
<p>Today, doctors in various countries around the world all know to use serum therapy, which is fast and effective and can treat critical illnesses that other drugs cannot treat. For example, in the case of diphtheria, before the invention of serum, those who contracted it often faced the threat of death. Now, with serum treatment, they are safe and sound. It should be noted that the method of serum therapy, although now widespread around the world and saving countless lives, its invention is not far from the present. It is truly a great achievement of the modern medical community. And its inventor, the great French physician Émile Roux, passed away only three months ago. The French government buried him with state honors, which is not without reason. Now, I will briefly describe the person of Dr. Roux and his academic achievements as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e258">(1) Dr. Roux's Character and Exemplary Life <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Roux was born on December 17, 1853, in Confolens, France. His father was the principal of a local middle school and died early, leaving behind nine children. Two sons died in the Franco-Prussian War. After graduating from middle school, Dr. Roux entered the medical department of the University of Clermont-Ferrand. Later, through the connection of his former chemistry professor, Mr. Dutilleux, he transferred to the University of Paris and became Mr. Dutilleux's assistant. In 1878, when the great physician Pasteur sought medical collaborators, Dr. Roux went to join him at Mr. Dutilleux's suggestion. Dr. Roux participated in all of Dr. Pasteur's research work. In 1883, Dr. Roux was sent by Dr. Pasteur to study Asian cholera. He returned to France the following year, and Dr. Pasteur immediately had him participate in the ongoing rabies research. Subsequently, in the years from 1885 to 1889, Dr. Roux announced his invention of anthrax and his research on infectious diseases of pigs. At the same time, starting in 1887, Dr. Roux collaborated with two other doctors to co-discover the toxins of diphtheria bacteria. This research was the main reason why diphtheria serum could be prepared six years later. Since then, the new method of serum therapy has appeared in the world and will continue to advance without end. In addition to the serum for treating diphtheria, Dr. Roux also collaborated with two or three doctors to produce serum for treating tetanus, plague, pneumonia, and other diseases. Thus, Pasteur's pioneering work was promoted and expanded by this talented man, and France's science was able to bestow its benefits upon the world. When Dr. Pasteur passed away in 1895, Mr. Dutilleux succeeded him as the director of the institute, and Dr. Roux assisted him. Later, when Director Dutilleux passed away in 1904, Dr. Roux succeeded him. He had already been elected as a member of the Academy of Medicine in 1895 and was elected as a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1899. Dr. Roux's honors and awards were elevated step by step until he received the highest level of the Legion of Honor in 1920. However, since 1900, Dr. Roux, due to overwork, needed rest and recuperation, so he was unwilling to participate in the various inventions that had made the Pasteur Institute shine brightly since he was thirty-three years old. However, Dr. Roux also fulfilled his duties of instruction and guidance, so his contribution to the assistance is still unforgettable. Moreover, Dr. Roux especially liked to maintain and encourage general researchers who did not aim at profit, such as the two great doctors Metchniket and Golemet, who were both able to achieve their goals thanks to Dr. Roux's efforts. The characteristic of Dr. Roux's character can be summed up in one sentence: he was modest and empty-minded. As for his integrity, it was almost like that of a monk, and his humility was especially admirable. When he invented the serum for treating diphtheria, French President Casimir Perier intended to personally present him with the Legion of Honor. However, Dr. Roux did not know in advance. When the president wanted to wear the medal for him, Dr. Roux ran away and exclaimed loudly, "I have done nothing meritorious. This thing should belong to Behring!" So the president had no choice but to forcefully grab his clothes and put it on him. Furthermore, Dr. Roux was simple by nature and did not care for adornment. One day, he went to see Baron Rothschild to discuss the funding problem of the institute. The gatekeeper, seeing that his clothes were old and worn, was unwilling to let him through. Only after three requests did he transmit the message. After the audience, the host sent him to the door and said to him, "If one million is not enough, please tell me." Then the gatekeeper was greatly surprised. But we should not judge Dr. Roux as a cold-blooded person based on the above trivial matters. For example, Dr. Roux and Dr. Pasteur were extremely close, but they often expressed different theories to their teacher due to academic reasons, and even each insisted on their own views and refused to yield. However, when they met in the laboratory the next day, they were still as friendly as ever. Sometimes Dr. Roux's views were not wrong, and once they were confirmed, Dr. Pasteur also frankly admitted them.</p>
<p>The two major characteristics of Dr. Roux's nature, namely simplicity and perseverance, have already been expressed. Now, we must add a third characteristic to complete Dr. Roux's personality. This third characteristic is compassion. Although Dr. Roux remained unmarried throughout his life, he loved family life very much, so he maintained constant contact with his relatives. He was also exceptionally amiable to his collaborators, so everyone was happy to associate with him. Moreover, Dr. Roux's painstaking research on diphtheria was also motivated by his compassionate feelings, not for profit. So, wasn't Dr. Roux's ability to invent the unprecedented new method of serum therapy aided by his compassionate spirit of saving all living beings? The progress of French medicine in the past forty years is due to Dr. Roux's contribution.</p>
<h3 id="e259">(2) Dr. Roux's Scholarship and Character <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Roux paid great attention to various physiological issues and also devoted himself to the study of various diseases. Therefore, the collaborators in the Pasteur Institute have mostly been influenced by Dr. Roux for thirty years. Even foreign specialized bacteriologists can all be called Dr. Roux's disciples. Dr. Roux established a bacteriology lecture hall on Dulot Street in 1889. At that time, more than 3,000 people came to listen, most of whom were foreign scholars and young doctors. Although Dr. Roux has passed away, his academic achievements have spread throughout the world, so Dr. Roux's spirit can be said to be immortal.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the general public, Dr. Roux is the person who invented the serum for treating diphtheria. Therefore, Dr. Roux is also the creator of serum therapy.</p>
<h3 id="e260">(3) Serum Therapy <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The great physician Pasteur was a discoverer of the microbial world and had declared war on molds, destroying some of their strong points. Then he passed on his academic achievements to his disciples. His disciples then attacked the molds again, and the most powerful among them was undoubtedly the great physician Émile Roux. In 1887, Dr. Roux published an article in the weekly journal of the Pasteur Institute, detailing the method of using a solution obtained from molds for immunization. At that time, the great physician Pasteur immediately realized the importance of this invention. Therefore, he made a declaration at a general meeting in the Academy of Sciences, saying that he had now proven that a dangerous disease that causes rapid death (diphtheria) can be immunized by injecting a chemical quantity of matter. This substance comes from the life of microorganisms that can cause death.</p>
<p>The following year (1888), Dr. Roux and Mr. Yersin collaborated to discover the toxin in the culture juice of diphtheria bacteria. Later, in 1890, two doctors, Behring and Kitasato, proved in Germany that by injecting the toxin invented by Dr. Roux and Mr. Yersin into animals using appropriate methods, their serum would have the ability to resist diphtheria. Serum is a part of the blood and is separated from it when the blood clots. Therefore, animals injected with the toxin of Dr. Roux and Mr. Yersin developed a reaction to the toxin, thus creating an antitoxin, which has the ability to resist diphtheria.</p>
<p>Four years later, in October 1894, Dr. Roux announced his recent achievements in collaboration with two doctors, Mr. Massi and Mr. Shahou, at the International Health Congress in Budapest. At that time, people all over the world were filled with respect and gratitude. Doctors, mold experts, and veterinarians from various countries all rushed to study the new method or to obtain serum. However, because this thing was extremely rare and could not be given in large quantities, after the promotion of a certain newspaper, a donation of one million was obtained, which was used to organize the large-scale production of serum for treatment and various preventive drugs transformed from the toxin invented by Dr. Roux (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e264">Is There Communication Between Wire and Wireless? <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Further Cooperation</p>
<p>Once wrote an article for a certain magazine in the telecommunications field. At that time, the National Government had not been established for long, and there was much discussion about developing transportation. Some proposed creating wired and wireless communication networks, which would be very effective and detailed, but considering the needs and economy, merchants were concerned that it might not be in line with the national conditions. Therefore, the author advocated at the time that the establishment of communication networks should not be divided by the boundaries of wired and wireless: "Where wired telegraph cannot reach, use telephone; where wired telegraph and telephone cannot reach, use wireless telegraph and wireless telephone, and communicate with each other to create a telecommunications network that reaches all parts of the country."</p>
<p>Although wired and wireless have a one-word difference in their names, they also have different materials and machinery in practice, but they are both communication weapons, which is beyond doubt. In the past, during the warlord era, wired and wireless were clearly divided, each establishing its own portal. In name, they belonged to the same transportation department, but in reality, "wired" and "wireless" were not coordinated. In recent years, with unified authority, development has also become balanced. Now, reading the newspaper, it is reported that the Ministry of Communications has also promulgated further cooperation methods for wired and wireless from April 1st. Although the actual rotation steps must wait for careful consideration and proper handling, the principle of "wired" and "wireless" communicating with each other has been established. Therefore, telegram senders do not have to ask whether wired or wireless can reach it. Just hand it over to the telegraph bureau for allocation, allowing it to be "wired" or "wireless," or "wireless" or "wired," with speed as the main goal, so that there is nothing that cannot be reached. This is really a great convenience for public communication. The so-called creation of the whole country as a large telecommunications network, the cooperation of wired and wireless, can be called the first step of success.</p>
<p>In terms of telegram business, telegrams often increase when accidents occur in the country. At this time, if the transmission of wireless is busy, wired can be used to coordinate. Dredging the telegram business and allocating work is like doing everything in an orderly manner. The so-called line congestion and the so-called telegram delay can be reduced substantially. The four words "rapid transmission" will be more realistically expressed after "wired and wireless communication," making senders and recipients exceptionally satisfied.</p>
<p>In short, further cooperation between wired and wireless to achieve communication and improve efficiency in business is not lacking in other countries, and my country should follow suit. External measures, such as joint registration, have been announced, and internal implementation, through the Ministry of Communications' careful planning, can be realized in a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e265">The New Life Movement and the Telecommunications Field <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The New Life Movement originated in Nanchang, and then continued in Beijing, Shanghai, Pinghan, and other places. In the past month, it has swept the country, starting from the inspection of personal clothing, food, housing, and transportation to strengthen the foundation of the national society. It cannot be said that it is not a fundamental strategy for national salvation. The definition of the New Life Movement has been explained by Chairman Chiang: "People's lives of clothing, food, housing, and transportation must conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame." Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the essential conditions for our spiritual life, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the essential conditions for our material life. The needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation must conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, so that material desires have no cover; the essence of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame must be expressed in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, so that integrity is not in vain. We serve in the telecommunications field, and we make a living here. Looking back and observing the future, we should strive for the New Life Movement. Now, I will list a few items to show a glimpse. What is said to the society is also to encourage ourselves with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Telecommunications is a state-owned enterprise. In the past, the responsible officials were mostly from the political world, and they inevitably carried a bit of officialdom. The staff in the bureau were full of prestige, and the general public had long regarded the telecommunications bureau as a government office. After the establishment of the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, it was determined that the telecommunications business should be commercialized. The telecommunications bureau is like a store, the staff is like a clerk, and the people who send and receive telegrams and calls are the customers who are warmly welcomed in the store. The clerks must be kind and humble to the customers and must not be arrogant and rude. The Ministry of Communications has repeatedly given earnest admonitions, and the bureau staff also abide by them, but in addition to self-encouragement, we still hope for more supervision from the society.</p>
<p>For sending telegrams, there is a distinction between ordinary and urgent, and there is a difference in the order of sending and receiving. If the telegram cannot be delivered due to business reasons, or the telegram is wrong, or the delivery is too late, the telecommunications bureau also has clauses for full or partial refunds. This has been clearly stipulated in the telegram business rules. Since the telecommunications bureau collects the telegram fee from the sender, it should bear the responsibility for fast and accurate transmission. Rights and obligations should not be confused. It is righteous and appropriate that the bureau staff do their best to serve the society. What they should abide by is also where righteousness lies.</p>
<p>The telecommunications authorities, because the price of telegrams in our country is quite high and cannot be used by the general public, and when the telecommunications economy is extremely difficult, they cannot reduce the price of telegrams as much as possible, putting the maintenance of the business at risk. Therefore, in the absence of any other way, they have stipulated various measures: (1) The name and address of the recipient within 15 characters will be counted as 5 characters for billing; (2) The urgent telegram fee will be doubled; (3) Postal transfer telegrams will be free of postage; (4) Road transfer telegrams will be free of over-the-line fees; (5) Public telegrams inquiring about the meaning of the words will be allowed free of charge; (6) Domestic social telegrams, whether inter-provincial or intra-provincial, will be uniformly 2 cents per Chinese character and 4 cents per foreign character. For several months, efforts have been made to work on the word "cheap" in order to arouse the public's interest in sending telegrams. As for the integrity and integrity of the responsible personnel of the telecommunications authorities, the Ministry pays special attention to this.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is ashamed of the international communication being controlled, so it established an international radio station to remedy it; it is ashamed of the old and outdated telephone machines, so it purchased telegraph clearing machines, printing machines, and automatic telephone machines to reform them. In order to solicit opinions from all walks of life, business inspectors were set up; in order to avoid errors in telegram transmission, proofreaders were assigned. For other facilities in business and engineering, the authorities are always concerned that our country's telecommunications is ashamed of not being able to keep pace with Europe and the United States, and they are always concerned that our country's telecommunications is ashamed of not being able to be fully utilized by the people of the whole country. "Knowing shame and being brave," the various reforms of the telecommunications administration in recent years are not the effect of the authorities being brave enough to take responsibility.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief discussion on the expression of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in the telecommunications field, based on what I can remember. It is not worthy of elegance, but at this time of repeated internal and external troubles, the telecommunications field has a sense of vigor, which is in line with the true meaning of the New Life Movement. As the Western proverb says, "Facts speak louder than words," so putting it forward is not intentionally promoting the telecommunications administration.</p>
<h3 id="e266">The Reasons for the Advancement of Automatic Telephones in Recent Years <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shaomei</p>
<p>Why has automatic telephone technology made such significant progress in our country recently? This is a very interesting question. If we wish to explain the reasons, it is more appropriate to explore the motivation and background:</p>
<p>(A) The original equipment of telephone bureaus has become dilapidated. The lifespan of telephone switching equipment is usually no more than ten years. During the maintenance period, one should plan for the replacement of old equipment with new, or set aside savings. When equipment becomes unusable, new machines should be purchased. However, due to various reasons, bureaus often find it difficult to attend to this in practice, resulting in mechanical equipment being used beyond its lifespan, which naturally affects operations. A look at the statistics of obstacles in the 17th year of various bureaus makes this clear.</p>
<p>Bureau  | Number of Line Obstacles | Number of Internal Equipment Obstacles | Number of User Equipment Obstacles</p>
<p>------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------</p>
<p>Capital | 25014                    | 13356                                   | 66181</p>
<p>Shanghai | 12141                    | 43726                                   | 471</p>
<p>Wuhan | 29681                    | 16238                                   | 20921</p>
<p>Qingdao | 6606                     | 3321                                    | 3023</p>
<p>In order to perfect the service and to meet the needs of society, there is a trend to abandon manual switching and replace it with automatic telephones.</p>
<p>(B) Heavy telephone traffic: The current charging system in domestic telephone bureaus is mostly a monthly flat rate. With a flat rate, users have unlimited telephone usage; even a single household installation may be shared with several other households. Looking at the exchange statistics of the 17th year of various telephone bureaus, the volume of telephone traffic is heavier than in major British and American cities with large populations and developed enterprises.</p>
<p>Bureau  | Number of Users | Average Number of Calls Per User Per Day</p>
<p>------- | --------------- | -----------------------------------------</p>
<p>Capital | 22912           | 3</p>
<p>Shanghai | 20271           | 9</p>
<p>Wuhan | 4510            | 20</p>
<p>Qingdao | 2634            | 16</p>
<p>Given the heavy telephone traffic in various bureaus as mentioned above, it goes without saying that users often experience difficulties such as "line busy" and "not connected." To thoroughly improve operations, automatic telephones are necessary. The measured service system is difficult to implement quickly in China, which is another reason.</p>
<p>(C) Difficulty in managing and training telephone operators:</p>
<p>In Europe and America, telephone companies have specialized schools to train switchboard operators. Looking at their detailed operating rules, switchboard operators cannot easily adhere to them without rigorous training. In China, the training period for telephone operators is largely based on the traditional "apprenticeship" system. Over time, bad habits inevitably develop, causing difficulties in management. The resulting response is to replace manual labor with machines, which is also a reason for the advancement of automatic telephones.</p>
<p>(D) Modernization of telephones: The term "automatic telephone" is novel. Today, construction projects invariably use it as a slogan to attract attention. For example, Wanxian, Sichuan, has only about a hundred subscribers. Purchasing a magneto switchboard would be very economical, but they adopted automatic telephones, based on the Chinese people's psychology of imitating fashion. This alone can explain the rest.</p>
<p>(E) Overproduction in foreign factories: Recently, the economies of European and American countries have declined. The output of various factories has already exceeded domestic demand, resulting in a severe problem of overproduction. These countries are trying to sell overseas, intending to use the Far East as an outlet. During this period of electrical reorganization in our country, they are competing to promote sales with all their might. Automatic telephones are a profitable business, and naturally one of the targets of foreign factories.</p>
<p>(F) Seeking confidentiality and speed of communication: When using manual telephones, operators must be involved in connecting the lines. Even if they are well-trained, misunderstandings can easily arise due to physiological variations and differences in language. Furthermore, users ultimately do not trust that operators can absolutely abide by the rules and not eavesdrop on conversations. For example, during the Wuhan government era, the bureau's equipment was still manual, while military and government agencies used automatic machines that were centralized. This was partly to ensure the confidentiality of conversations, and partly to allow for rapid communication during emergencies. Other places, such as the Ministry of Railways and the Shenyang Arsenal, adopted automatic telephones very early, based on the reasons mentioned above.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Three Recent Major Contributions of German Telecommunications <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jiemin</p>
<p>Recent researchers of telegraphy all believe that telegraphs should tend towards "telephonization." Although teleprinters are common in various European and American countries, telecommunications engineers still consider them to need improvement. In 1928, Germany had "Residence Telegraphy" installations, where subscribers could rent dedicated lines from the local telegraph headquarters and install automatic teleprinters in their homes or businesses to communicate directly with other subscribers with similar equipment. However, due to various reasons, only a few large companies used this type of machine. The scope was small and difficult to popularize. The German Postal and Telegraph Department, recognizing this, conducted several studies and made the following three major contributions:</p>
<p>(I) Expansion of Automatic Teleprinters: It is planned to utilize existing telephone underground cables between various cities for the exclusive use of those who have installed automatic teleprinters. These circuits will connect each subscriber to an "automatic telegraph exchange," which will then distribute the messages. The equipment used by each subscriber will be installed by the managing agency after inspection, and maintained by the subscriber themselves. Berlin and Hamburg have already conducted trials, and the following three types of fees are stipulated per household, per month, per kilometer of dedicated line (referring to the distance from the subscriber's residence to the exchange):</p>
<p>A. Station rental fee: 5 marks</p>
<p>B. Line rental fee: 5 marks</p>
<p>C. Communication fee: 0.10 marks per six minutes, with an additional one-third for every two minutes thereafter, and a one-third reduction from 5:00 PM to 8:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>The printing is fully automatic. Subscribers only need to dial the number on a dial (similar to an automatic telephone dial) in their room to connect to the teleprinter of the person they wish to communicate with. Since there are ample circuits, there is no need to wait. If the recipient is not in the room, the printed message can be received automatically without error. There is a small box next to the machine with two keys and a dial. When sending a message, first flip and press the "Service" key to connect the circuit, then dial the recipient's call number (dialing method is the same as automatic telephone). Once the last number rebounds, communication can begin. After finishing, flip the "Eod" key to immediately disconnect the circuit. There is also a special "Reply" key dedicated to verifying the call. If the sender wants to know if the connection is correct after dialing, they can flip this key, and the recipient's teleprinter will automatically print out the recipient's name and address, thus eliminating the drawback of misconnection. The same procedure can be used to send messages to other places, which can be sent free of charge to the local telegraph bureau.</p>
<p>(II) Alternating Use of Telephone and Telegraph: This type of circuit for alternating telephone and telegraph use is a simple alternating current type, which can be called "Single Vocal Frequency Telegraphy." The equipment used is as shown in the diagram.</p>
<p>If subscriber FI in the diagram wants to talk to subscriber through central telegraph bureau FA, the branch line keys U1, U1 are as shown in the diagram. To send a message and record the conversation, simply twist the branch line keys U1, U2, and both parties can communicate on teleprinters M1, M2. After finishing, hang up the phone and the circuit will be disconnected. When no one is receiving telegrams at night, a "Night Commutator" can be installed. When the recipient is away, twisting this key will automatically enable the teleprinter to receive telegrams. After stopping, the circuit can be automatically disconnected within 30 seconds. The communication fee for this service is the same as the telephone fee, so subscribers can freely send telegrams or make calls without restriction. The installation of this type of telegraph machine does not affect the telephone system in any way. Whether it can send telegraphs or transfer electricity to various places is still under study.</p>
<p>(III) Wireless Automatic Teleprinter: To facilitate the simultaneous and rapid transmission of financial, sports, and other news, Germany is installing a "SiemensHell Teleprinter" for wireless transmission. This machine is very cheap to purchase and easy to manage, and anyone can send and receive messages. When the central station sends a message, most stations can receive it simultaneously. The received telegram is in facsimile format, and is identical to the sender's. The characteristics of this type of telegram are that it is simple, safe, not limited by long or short waves, and free from air interference. Furthermore, no one can illegally eavesdrop or intercept the transmission.</p>

<p>— Guan</p>
<p>Spring is sunny and bright, making it ideal for flying kites. Kite flying is an old Chinese pastime. Enjoying oneself at the right time is appropriate, so many prominent figures now advocate its promotion. Adults and children who enjoy kite flying are naturally all the more excited to hear such news.</p>
<p>However, according to newspaper reports, airlines are considering banning kite flying because it obstructs flight targets. This is a setback for kite flying. I am not familiar with aviation, so I will talk about power lines. It is common to see fragments and remnants of kites hanging on power lines in and around cities during the spring season. This is the result of kite flying by our friends who are enjoying themselves. It should be known that power lines continuously transmit electricity. These dangling fragments become conductive when it rains, interfering with communication. If a kite falls and gets caught on a power line, climbing up to retrieve it is even more dangerous due to the risk of electric shock. Therefore, I am using this space in the magazine to inform our friends who enjoy kite flying in a timely manner:</p>
<p>Fly kites in a way that allows you to retrieve them. Do not let them touch power lines!</p>
<h3 id="e270">Regarding Temporary Cancellation of Long-Distance Telephone Calls <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>The Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Communications on June 2nd of last year have been officially implemented since March 1st of this year. Article 7, Section 2 stipulates that if the caller requests a temporary cancellation of the call, the regulation is the same as Section 1, requiring a charge of one-third of the call fee. Outsiders believe that charging one-third of the call fee even when the call has not been connected seems overly harsh. According to inquiries by this reporter, the Ministry of Communications established this article in consideration of the interests of users, not out of severity. A brief account is given below:</p>
<p>Article 31, Section 7, Paragraph 1 of the Telephone Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunications Convention revised in Madrid states, "Except for pre-arranged calls, in the event of any call where the calling or receiving party refuses to speak, the fee due shall be equal to the fee for a one-minute ordinary call made by the two machines during the charging period at the time of receipt of the refusal, with the minimum charge being fifty centimes." In other words, if the calling or receiving party refuses to speak, a minimum fee of fifty centimes should be charged. Article 1 of the Ministry of Communications' Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations is based on this section. In fact, when the calling party requests a call, the calling bureau must register it and transmit it to the receiving bureau in turn, and then notify the receiving party to answer the call. This procedure is quite complicated. If the calling party requests a temporary cancellation of the call after the calling bureau has already notified the receiving bureau, or when the receiving bureau has already notified the receiving party, not only does the long-distance line suffer a time loss, but the receiving party also experiences unnecessary trouble. Therefore, this article was specially established to show a restriction. According to the regulations in the telegram rules, if the sender requests to cancel a telegram that has already been transmitted, the telegraph bureau will only refund the message fee for the untransmitted portion of the journey. This has the same meaning as this article.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of the user's interests, newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai often register arbitrarily during the busiest times for news transmission, regardless of whether they have any news, rushing to be first. When they are eventually connected in turn, if the newspaper has nothing to report at that time, they often request cancellation. Such a situation ties up long-distance lines, which is a minor issue, but it delays the transmission of news from other newspapers, which has a major impact. Therefore, for the convenience of most newspapers, a handling fee must be charged for this type of cancellation, which is ultimately more beneficial than harmful to the user.</p>
<p>In summary, while a calling party's temporary request to cancel a call is rare, a separate article had to be added to the legislation to ensure thoroughness. When the new Beijing-Shanghai line is completed and communication is smooth, there will be no impact from excessive registrations, and there will be no need for temporary cancellation requests.</p>
<p>In the past, when one wanted to send a telegram or mail a letter, one had to run around, which was very inconvenient. Now that the post office and telegraph office are merged, people from all walks of life can go to the same place to send telegrams or mail letters, saving a lot of trouble!</p>
<p>The second type of movement is the merger of wired and wireless telegraphy. Wired and wireless telegraphy are really just different forms of telegraph transmission with equivalent effects. They each have their strengths and weaknesses. If the two are merged and operated together, using each other's strengths, then the shortcomings of either wired or wireless telegraphy can be overcome, and the telegrams sent by the public can safely and quickly reach their destinations. In order to ensure the safety and speed of telegrams sent by the public, the Ministry of Communications resolutely ordered the merger of wired and wireless telegraphy management from April 1st. From now on, when sending telegrams, people simply need not specify whether to use "wired" or "wireless." Deciding on the transmission method can be entrusted to the bureau staff, as they can choose the most appropriate method based on various operational and technical factors.</p>
<p>The above two movements are general and apply to the whole country. In the Shanghai area, there is another cooperative movement, which is to combine all telegram registrations at the International Radio Station in Sassoon House on Nanjing Road, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau at 7 Luchi Road, the National Wireless Radio Headquarters on Minguo Road, and the Great Northern Water Line Telegraph Office at 34 Edward Road, the Great Eastern Water Line Telegraph Office, and the Pacific Water Line Telegraph Office, under the newly established "Shanghai United Telegram Registration Office." This movement may seem small in scope, but it is also very significant. In the past, the telegram registrations at the above locations were not unified due to various reasons, such as the differences between wired and wireless telegraphy, the distinction between international and domestic telegrams, and the different positions of foreign underwater cable companies. As a result, some charged registration fees, some were free, and some had several registrants using the same registration word. The methods varied! Disputes arose from time to time, causing inconvenience to those sending telegrams. Now, telegram registrations at all locations have been unified! As long as business firms pay a registration fee at the "Shanghai United Telegram Registration Office," they can use it for telegrams transmitted by wired, wireless, and various submarine cables. Unifying the procedures and eliminating disputes is a great convenience for people sending telegrams in Shanghai.</p>

<p>(The Development of Automatic Telephones in Germany)</p>
<p>The German Postal and Telegraph Department's revitalization plan, with the government's economic assistance, will convert 200 manual telephone exchanges to automatic exchanges between New Year's Day and the end of March this year. Among them, 125 exchanges will use 100 trunk lines, 85 exchanges will use 200 trunk lines, 80 exchanges will use 1,000 trunk lines, and the remaining 10 exchanges will have more than 1,000 lines. As of New Year's Day this year, Germany has 5,445 exchanges, of which 2,228 are automatic. Work is continuing to convert all exchanges to automatic. (Report from the U.S. Commercial Attaché in Berlin)</p>
<p>(The Rise of Radio in Soviet Russia)</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian government has allocated £2 million this year to promote radio. Last year, Soviet Russia had 2 million radios, and this year it plans to install 950,000 new radios. Of these, 10% will be installed in rural areas.</p>

<p>(Improvement of Telegraph and Telephone Services in Austria)</p>
<p>The Austrian special budget for 1934 allocated 2.6 million schillings (one schilling equals 14 U.S. cents) for new installations by the Postal and Telegraph General Bureau. The business community is busy manufacturing large quantities of telegraph and telephone equipment. Last year, there was no long-distance telephone underground cable installed, but the government has allocated 7 million schillings for the installation of a submarine cable between Vienna and Pasace. (Report from the U.S. Consul General in Austria)</p>
<p>(Reduction of Telephone Rates in Australia)</p>
<p>The plan to promote rural automatic telephones has been announced by the Postmaster General, who hopes to establish 30 locations this year. He also proposed reducing the current telephone rate of £5 10s per household by £1. If business does not increase, this price reduction will result in an annual loss of approximately £35,000, but he believes that once the rate is reduced, users will be happy to use it.

<p>(Opening of Facsimile Telegrams Between France and Italy)</p>
<p>Facsimile telegrams between Paris and Rome have been opened. The cost is based on the size of the area of the telegram, calculated at 1.85 francs per square centimeter, with a minimum cost of 185 francs. All French post offices accept this type of telegram. (London Electrical Review)</p>
<p>(Abolition of Morse Machines in the United Kingdom)</p>
<p>The British Post Office's plan to abolish Morse machines is in its final stages. By the end of the European War, the Morse machines on all main lines had been replaced with Baudot machines. For bureaus with a daily average of less than 70 telegrams, the voice transmission system is gradually being adopted. According to a report from the U.S. Commercial Attaché, this work has been implemented in various bureaus since 1929. Since then, domestic telegraph business has taken on a new look! The percentage of telegrams handled by each machine in 1929, 1932, and 1933 is listed below:</p>
<p>| Machine      | 1929    | 1932    | 1933    |</p>
<p>|-------------|---------|---------|---------|</p>
<p>| Teleprinter | 16.1    | 69.5    | 72.3    |</p>
<p>| Voice Trans. | 13.5    | 15.0    | 21.3    |</p>
<p>| Morse       | 28.4    | 9.0     | 3.5     |</p>

<p>| Other       | 4.3     | 1.9     | 1.6     |</p>
<p>Once the new telegraph and telephone machines in the central telegraph bureau are in operation this year, the amount of Morse telegraph business listed in the right table will definitely be replaced by telephones. (London Telegraph and Telephone Monthly)</p>

<p>(Commercial Dedicated Lines for Sending and Receiving Telegrams)</p>
<p>In major cities of various countries, telegraph bureaus and commercial firms that send many telegrams have special dedicated lines for sending and receiving telegrams in order to reduce delays in delivery by messengers, making communication very convenient for businesses. In order to expedite the sending and receiving of telegrams by commercial firms and mines in various locations, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated the "Regulations for Commercial Dedicated Lines for Sending and Receiving Telegrams," which will be implemented from the date of promulgation of the regulations on March 31. The main points of the regulations are excerpted below:</p>
<p>1.  Commercial dedicated lines are divided into telephone dedicated lines and telegraph machine dedicated lines. Those who wish to install them can contact the local telegraph bureau or station.</p>
<p>2.  Those in areas with city telephone service can rent a dedicated line from the telephone bureau. Those without city telephone service can have the bureau or station install a dedicated line on their behalf. The line rental fee or installation fee shall be paid by the applicant.</p>
<p>3.  Those installing telephone dedicated lines shall be responsible for the installation and rental fees of the telephones used at both ends. If it is necessary to rent a soundproof room at the bureau or station to install a telephone, a monthly rental fee of five yuan shall be paid. Otherwise, it is also possible not to rent.</p>
<p>4.  Those installing telegraph machine dedicated lines shall have the required telegraph machines at both ends prepared by the bureau or station. The applicant can rent them from the bureau or station. If renting a teleprinter, a machine deposit of 2,000 yuan shall be paid, with a monthly rental fee of 40 yuan and an installation fee of 10 yuan. If renting a Morse machine, a machine deposit of 500 yuan shall be paid, with a monthly rental fee of 20 yuan and an installation fee of 10 yuan. The applicant shall be responsible for the salaries of the operators required at the applicant's end, but can borrow them from the bureau or station.</p>
<p>(Reduction of Domestic Social Telegram Prices)</p>
<p>Since its establishment by the Ministry of Communications, the domestic social telegram service has been praised by the public for its extremely low prices. However, the original pricing doubled the cost for telegrams sent to provinces other than the sender's province. As a result, domestic social telegrams between provinces were not very developed. In order to thoroughly benefit the people, the Ministry of Communications has now uniformly changed the pricing to be the same as that for telegrams within the same province, which is 2 cents per Chinese character and 4 cents per English character, effective from May 1st.</p>

<p>The aim is none other than to provide convenience to the general public</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of the enthusiastic promotion of the New Life Movement, the Ministry of Communications has recently undertaken several extremely important cooperative movements. Although its motivation is to save expenses and facilitate operations, the biggest reason is still to think of the general public and to seek convenience in communication.</p>
<p>The first movement is the joint establishment of postal and telegraph offices. The postal service and telegraph service are both businesses run by the state, under the management of the Ministry of Communications. If people have matters that are not very important and are not time-sensitive, they simply write a letter. If they have matters that are time-sensitive and relatively important, they send a telegram. Letters and telegrams are similar in nature, and there is a strict need for cooperation. Previously, the postal and telegraph services were separate, not</p>

<h3 id="e274">The Situation of Global Cotton Industry Statistics <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>According to the statistics on the global cotton industry from the International Federation of Cotton Spinners' Associations for the first half of 1933-34 (i.e., from August 1 of last year to the end of January this year), the survey results show that the global consumption of cotton increased by 190,000 bales from February to July of last year. Among them, the consumption of Indian cotton and Egyptian cotton was the highest, while the consumption of American cotton decreased by 300,000 bales. If we look at the cotton consumption of each country separately, Germany increased by 114,000 bales, the United Kingdom increased by 104,000 bales, and Japan increased by 70,000 bales, but the United States decreased by 400,000 bales, China decreased by 60,000 bales, and other countries did not change much. The inventory of cotton for textiles in January of this year was higher than at the end of July last year. Except for Indian cotton, which decreased by 324,000 bales, American cotton, Egyptian cotton, and other types of cotton all increased, so the total increased by about 166,000 bales. If we look at each country separately, Japan decreased by 200,000 bales, India decreased by 110,000 bales, but the United States sharply increased by 250,000 bales, China increased by 72,000 bales, and Italy increased by 33,000 bales. As for the number of textile machines in use, at the end of January this year, it decreased by 124,000 spindles compared to the end of July last year, mainly due to the sharp decrease of 1,049,000 spindles in the United Kingdom. Other countries generally increased, but Japan alone increased by 432,000 spindles. In addition, from August of last year to January of this year, the working hours of textile mills in various countries (calculated on a 48-hour week) were more than in the previous period. The most notable were China and Japan. The list is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e275">Amidst the Decline of China's Silk Industry: The Global Rayon Industry <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Guangxu</p>
<p>When we recall the history of China's international trade, we immediately realize how important silk and tea were to China's foreign trade. However, this glory has long since ceased to be seen again. The tea industry declined first, and the silk industry followed. Even today, scholars are advocating for the rectification of the silk industry. Recently, the National Economic Commission has even established a Silkworm Improvement Committee to recruit female silkworm breeders in order to revive China's silk industry. It is a good thing to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, but when we look at the situation today, we feel that it may be too late. With the rapid progress of the silk industries in Italy and Japan in the forefront, and the threat of rayon in the rear, it is doubtful whether China's silk industry can have any hope of revival. The purpose of this article is, on the one hand, to describe the backwardness of China's silk industry in the international market, and on the other hand, to focus on the extreme progress of the strong rayon industry. The pressure from the world silk industry, not only China, is enough to make people fear. Please first briefly describe the world silk market in recent years.</p>
<p>According to estimates by the French Mssrs. Morel Journel et Cie, the world silk industry declined again from 1932 to 1933, with both output decreasing and prices weakening.</p>

<p>Shanghai     5,800       4,820       2,160       2,716       2,725</p>

<p>Japan     12,120       33,595       33,020       31,100       28,800</p>
<p>Central Asia     435       330       145       382       5</p>
<p>Central Europe     4,235       5,08       3,410       3,640       3,245</p>
<p>Italy     1,880       890       665       668       648</p>
<p>Total     27,365       40,045       48,96       39,733       37,064</p>
<p>*The estimated amount of Italian silk does not mean that Japan's output will decrease. In fact, because there is too much silk stored in New York and Japan, Japan may lower its production.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the world supply of silk has gradually decreased since 1930. According to the law of supply and demand, the price of silk should have risen, but this is not the case. The reason is that rayon has gradually replaced silk. According to the same source, the silk price not only did not rise, but fell sharply. Please see the table below for the prices of various silks in Lyon. (Average) Unit: Francs     Place of Origin     1929     1930     1931     1932     1933</p>
<p>Italy     1150     155     118     88     67</p>
<p>Shanghai     300     90     155     105     78</p>
<p>Sichuan     245     40     125     85     70</p>
<p>Wuxi     75     65     50     36</p>
<p>Japan     285     170     145     92     62</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the decline of the world silk market has been rapid, and the average market price last year was only one-fourth of that in 1929. Due to the devaluation of the Japanese yen, the loss on the Japanese side was still small, but the silk merchants in China have been unable to supply their goods to the market for sale under this sharp drop. Then, the so-called rectification of the silk industry today, the benefits that can be obtained are probably very small. Observing from a global perspective, even if China can revive the silk industry, its position in the international market is still difficult to predict. Or to put it bluntly, today's silk is not an irreplaceable product, and the need for silk is no longer active in reality.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the source, we can see that the decline of the silk industry is not limited to China. The momentum of rayon is enough to make silk lose its luster. Countries that previously needed silk have either tried to increase the manufacture of rayon, or purchased rayon from other countries to replace it.</p>
<p>In recent years, the major rayon-producing countries in the world have actively increased their production, and the needs of the world have also prompted them to speed up production. In order to fundamentally discuss the reason for the decline of the silk industry, we cannot but review this rayon industry.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom and other countries, the progress of rayon manufacturing technology has made rayon yarn sufficient in quality and practicality to be used for various textiles. At the same time, the price has become lower due to the increase in work efficiency. As a result, the need for the silk industry has been greatly affected. Even cotton and wool have been affected.</p>
<p>The country with the largest rayon production in the world is the United States, which has always maintained its leading position. We can obtain the production of rayon in various countries in the world, as shown in the table below. (Unit: Thousand Pounds)</p>
<p>Country     1933     1932     1931     1930</p>
<p>United States     172,105     131,085     140,800     115,000</p>

<p>United Kingdom     84,080     72,510     54,570     48,870</p>
<p>Italy     82,040     70,145     76,120     59,700</p>
<p>Germany     68,200     64,680     55,000     57,880</p>
<p>France     57,200     47,255     36,365     39,160</p>
<p>Netherlands     23,650     19,405     19,800     15,840</p>
<p>Switzerland     10,560     2,055     9,900     9,600</p>
<p>Belgium     9,605     9,780     10,395     10,450</p>
<p>Canada     7,610     7,120     5,565     4,840</p>
<p>Other     10,495     21,145     15,525     55</p>
<p>Total     625,470     518,575     470,790     410,225</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the rayon industry is showing the opposite trend to the silk industry. The increase in production last year reached more than 100 million pounds. We seem to be unable to ignore the progress of the rayon industry.</p>
<p>Japan's production increased by more than 20 million pounds last year. Japan's production is competitive in the international market due to lower raw material prices and special labor costs, especially in the Far East, where rayon fabrics compete more fiercely with cotton fabrics.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom's production also increased by more than 10 million pounds, and most of the increase was consumed in the domestic market and did not need to be exported. Since January of last year, various manufacturing companies decided to accelerate production by 30% and reduce the price by 3 pence per pound. Moreover, after processing, there is no need to build more factories, only to improve the existing factories, so the cost has been reduced. In the United Kingdom, this is gradually becoming a force opposing cotton, but the tax rate on rayon in the United Kingdom is very high, so it is difficult to compete with cotton. The competition against silk is not affected by this, because the tax on silk is also higher.</p>
<p>In the United States, the production increase last year was the largest, at more than 40 million pounds. In particular, a type of acetate rayon is the most daunting, because some clothing powders can be woven from it. Although the price is higher than the general type, the consumption volume has not declined slightly. Especially at the end of last year, sales were the most prosperous, and those who made underwear had to use it.</p>
<p>In addition, the progress of this industry in major European countries cannot be denied. Italy and the Netherlands are trying to increase manufacturing in order to export and compete with Japan's silk industry. Moreover, the cartel system is still prevalent in Europe, seeking to standardize the price of cloth. France is also working hard to increase manufacturing in order to reduce the import of silk.</p>
<p>With the rise of the rayon industry in recent years, the silk industry has been greatly affected. The United States, which used to be the largest sales market, has become the leader in the rayon industry, and France, which is famous for its Lyon silk market, is also stepping up its manufacture and use of rayon. It can be seen that today's silk seems to have a sense of being left behind. However, it is not the case. People must not give up on its rectification because of this. Silk has many things that rayon cannot match. Today, the reason why rayon is full of products is because of its low price and good quality. However, it is well known that it is not durable. The price of silk is naturally higher than that of rayon, but its durability is not comparable to that of rayon. Moreover, with the economic decline of the world, the purchasing power of people in various countries has decreased, so they have abandoned the durable silk and taken the cheap and easily damaged rayon.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of the situation in China, the organization and increase of silk are secondary. The most important thing is the improvement of quality. If we can earnestly rectify the quality, on the one hand, we can compete with Japan and Italy, and on the other hand, we can gradually eliminate the arrogance of rayon. Now is the time to advocate the plan for the rectification of silk, but I hope that the people of the country can recognize the current malpractices, and then prescribe the right medicine, in order to talk about the hope of revival. May our people work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e276">Further Discussion on Fisheries Investigation and its Strategies <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Ruo Qian</p>
<p>It was reported in the newspaper the other day that the authorities are planning to unify and control the national fisheries industry.</p>
<p>After reading it, I felt overjoyed, and I believe that people in the fisheries industry share the same feeling. The other day, I discussed that the basis of unification and control lies in a clear understanding of the principles involved. A clear understanding of the principles requires a detailed investigation. Now, I will further discuss my limited views with people in the society.</p>
<p>Fisheries investigation is considered by all countries as the most important fundamental work for all fisheries facilities. Let's take Japan as an example. In 1931, Japan initiated the Economic Rehabilitation Movement for agricultural, mountainous, and fishing villages. At that time, due to the economic downturn in various areas in the preceding years, the output of products dropped abnormally. Agricultural, mountainous, and fishing villages felt especially exhausted. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry established the Economic Rehabilitation Department, which was divided into four sections to specialize in this matter. On the one hand, various lecture meetings were held to disseminate information about the matter. On the other hand, the Great Japan Fisheries Association and the Imperial Fisheries Association, the two major authorities in the fisheries industry, jointly conducted economic surveys of fishing villages. The significance of the survey was to accurately understand the economic and industrial situation of the fishing villages, as well as the environmental and social conditions of the area, in order to establish the direction of the economic rehabilitation plan for agricultural, mountainous, and fishing villages. Japan has always attached importance to investigation and has statistics for various places over the years. However, even at the beginning of the planning direction, a large-scale and detailed investigation is still necessary. This shows that if we want to improve and construct a career, we must start with investigation.</p>
<p>Now, what is the state of the fisheries industry in our country? Don't you see that the number of fishing boats is decreasing day by day? The price of fish is falling day by day? Imported aquatic products are flooding in like a tide, and sea pirates are as numerous as cattle hairs. The result of this cycle is to promote the overall bankruptcy of the fisheries industry. Therefore, since the beginning of the Republic of China, predecessors in the aquatic products industry have been running around and calling for the hope of reviving the fisheries industry. As a result, some people have established aquatic products schools, some have held new-style fishing vessels, and some have established fisheries experimental fields. Gradually, to this day, the country and society have become aware of the importance of the fisheries industry. Don't you see the publicity in newspapers and magazines? The government's plans? However, what is the state of the fisheries industry in our country? I am afraid it is still groping in the dark, which makes the publicity words easily like clouds passing by, and the implementation of the plan like building a house in the desert. That is why for more than 20 years, people have been shouting and advocating with all their might, but have not received the slightest success so far! Is this not because we have not been able to know the original situation of our country in detail? Therefore, it is believed that if we want to reorganize and develop the fisheries industry in our country, we must start with investigation.</p>
<p>However, everyone knows that the investigation is difficult to carry out. Fisheries investigation is no exception. Therefore, there must be a precise investigation plan before we can follow the map and achieve success. It is believed that the purpose of the fisheries investigation needed in our country today is to investigate the economic and technical conditions of the national fisheries industry, so as to compile investigation reports and serve as research and suggestions for fishery policy facilities and fishery construction. And its greatest purpose is to serve as a reference for future unification and control, in order to seek the revitalization of the entire fisheries industry. Therefore, the investigation area should cover the whole country. However, due to the vast scope of fisheries, marine fisheries should be investigated first. At the same time, important freshwater fisheries should be handled first. The scope of the investigation should cover all aspects, such as the economic conditions of labor, capital, trade, fishery village organization, and fishermen's life; the natural conditions of fishing grounds, fishery products, and fishing seasons; the technical conditions of fishing boats, fishing gear, fishing methods, aquaculture, and manufacturing. In addition, the population, culture, transportation, consumption power, labor force, and commodity prices related to various conditions cannot be omitted rashly. The strategy of investigation should be to personally investigate. Therefore, a national fisheries investigation general agency should be established to formulate an investigation plan, and then gradually proceed step by step in order to achieve great results.</p>
<p>So, what is the strategy for investigation? It is believed that the actual investigation of fishing villages in various places should be carried out to prepare for future measures to stabilize fishing villages and control sales. On the one hand, individual investigations should be carried out on the important production fisheries in the country (especially those with oceanic characteristics) to serve as a technique for production control. Please elaborate on it. Why do we advocate the investigation of fishing villages? Fishing villages are the birthplace of fisheries and the self-sufficient unit of the country. What we hope for in fishing villages is the paradise of fishing villages. Therefore, all residents of fishing villages must have the spirit of coexistence and co-prosperity, the technology of fishing and aquaculture, and the need to protect fishing grounds and aquatic animals. For their own operations, they must be hardworking and resilient. Then the fishing villages will be stable, and the fisheries can be revived. However, we still cannot say the strategy for the prosperity of fishing villages. Today, although the fishing villages in our country know that they are bankrupt and collapsing, it is difficult to obtain a definite conclusion on the degree of fragmentation and collapse. How can we talk about rectifying and arranging them freely? Moreover, the fishing villages themselves have their inherent difficulties. The fishermen in fishing villages and the farmers in rural areas are very different in their production. Farmers have the land rights of cultivated land and the ownership of immovable products produced on their land (although there are now many farmers who rent land for cultivation, but in theory, it is always like this, and fishermen mostly operate by borrowing). Therefore, their own labor, diligence, and technology are the key to their direct interests. Therefore, farmers' work does not harm others, nor is it harmed by others. However, fishermen are the opposite. They fish in the public waters 丨 fishing grounds 丨 to capture mobile aquatic animals. Moreover, the so-called fishermen can operate freely at any time and in any fishing ground, regardless of anyone. Therefore, if they do not catch, they will be caught by others, and early catching will harm others. Therefore, the coastal fishing grounds have become the battlefield of fishing villagers, and the diligence and technology of fishermen have only become weapons. Therefore, if we want to rationalize the operation of fishing villages and make the state of fishing villages a paradise, we must promote the spirit of mutual assistance, and take the environment of fishing villages in various places as the background, and solve conflicts according to local conditions, and then there is hope. However, in order to use the power of guidance and control to achieve the effect of fishing village prosperity, and to take measures according to local conditions, it is really useless if we do not conduct economic investigations of individual fishing villages. Now, please speak with facts. The cuttlefish fishery in Jiangsu and Zhejiang used to be captured by trawling, but now the fishermen in Wenzhou and Taizhou capture them with cuttlefish cages. However, the function of cuttlefish cages is to reduce labor and increase catches. Therefore, they think that they have made contributions to improving fishing gear and catch indiscriminately everywhere. However, the laying of cuttlefish cages is a kind of fixed fishing gear, which occupies most of the fishing ground area, causing the original fishermen to lose their production channels. Moreover, the cages are often attached with cuttlefish eggs, which must be scraped off with knives and sticks when collecting catches. Therefore, there must be many that cannot hatch, which will greatly hinder the breeding of cuttlefish. Therefore, the original fishermen are also justified in wanting to eliminate this abnormal development, and conflicts arise between fishing villages. Due to the corruption of the past fishery administration, and the failure to understand the situation, the blood case of the double gang fight on Yuanhua Mountain was caused. Therefore, if the situation of fishing villages in various places is clearly investigated, and appropriate fishery management personnel and guidance personnel are placed, they will be educated, guided, and improve the organization of fishing villages to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual love. On the one hand, administrative power will be used to divide fishing areas, and technology will be tested to protect breeding and increase production. Then the fishing villages will be stable and the fisheries will be revitalized. Therefore, it is believed that the economic investigation of fishing villages is indispensable.</p>
<p>Why do we promote the individual investigation of important fisheries? The important fisheries are large in scale and high in production, and involve many parties, which are enough to affect the prosperity and decline of the national fisheries industry. Therefore, according to the needs of the facts, we should organize the national system of this fishery for the convenience of unified control. In terms of itself, this fishery has its common needs for technology and equipment. Therefore, organizing a group of this fishery and bringing all the operators of this fishery under unified control can unify the goals and share the benefits, so that they can plan together to seek the improvement of themselves. Moreover, important fisheries have their internal common points and external different points. Therefore, individual investigations must be carried out. And in terms of the fact of investigation, important fisheries mostly have a very wide range of fishing. If the investigation is carried out by region, and involves more than two provinces and two regions, the measures will definitely feel difficult. Moreover, the so-called important fisheries are mostly oceanic fisheries in nature. Their fishing grounds, fishing gear, and operations cannot be tied to fishing villages. Moreover, how should we nurture, maintain, and promote important fisheries so that they become formal oceanic fisheries and promote the revitalization of the entire fisheries industry? Therefore, important fisheries need individual investigation. Furthermore, the possibilities of oceanic fisheries in our country cannot go to the outer sea to fish. Most of them are transferred to coastal fishing grounds. Therefore, they must be individually controlled to promote progress. For example, the new-style steamship fisheries in our country are all transferred to the coastal fishing grounds. Therefore, since the establishment, the catches have been reduced, and the coastal fishermen have been hit. It is believed that the tragic decline of fisheries in recent years is not unrelated to this. However, steamship operators must also have their difficulties, such as insufficient capital, lack of technical personnel, and steamship operators are all business-oriented, and cannot abandon fishing work to investigate the ocean and explore fishing grounds. Therefore, we should first know the current situation, investigate in detail, and promote the formation of this industry group. The highest fishery control agency will directly control it and provide various assistance in terms of technology (the establishment of instructors, the holding of investigation ships) and economy (low-interest loans, the establishment of bonuses). Then the establishment of oceanic fisheries is promising, and the revitalization of the entire fisheries industry is also promising. Therefore, it is considered that if we want to reorganize and develop fisheries, the investigation of the economic situation of important fisheries is indispensable.</p>
<p>As for the strategy of investigation, the establishment of a national fisheries research institute is the most important thing. Then the general institute and the provinces and cities should jointly form branch institutes. Then the general institute will conduct individual investigations of important fisheries, and the branch institutes will conduct investigations of fishing villages. The results of the two investigations will be compiled into statistical reports and sent to the general institute for research, and then published to the society for common discussion. Now, I will draft an outline of the organization based on my limited views, and offer it for discussion and correction.</p>
<p>1. Establish a national fisheries research institute with three departments: general affairs, investigation, and publication. Then, jointly establish investigation branch institutes with provinces and cities, which also have three departments: general affairs, investigation, and publication. However, under the general institute, there is also a research committee, which is divided into four departments: fishing village organization, fishery economy, fishery technology, and compilation. There is also a training committee, which is divided into technical training classes, fishing village education classes, and warehouse management classes (regarding the management of fish markets and aquatic products warehouses).</p>
<p>2. Tasks: The national fisheries research institute is tasked with investigating the situation of national fisheries. The general affairs department is responsible for (1) matters related to official documents and all documents; (2) matters related to the budget and final accounts of all expenses in the institute. The investigation department is responsible for (1) thorough investigation of certain fisheries; (2) investigation and statistics of various fisheries; (3) guiding and training national fishery situation correspondents to establish an accurate investigation foundation; (4) joint investigation with national aquatic products schools and testing agencies. The publication department is responsible for (1) reporting on the results of investigation and statistics; (2) research reports on certain issues; (3) translating and publishing research reports and other related items on the aquatic products industry in various countries. The research committee is to research the results of the national fisheries investigation and to propose a national fisheries design. Therefore, the fishing village organization department is responsible for (1) matters related to the public security and education of fishing villages; (2) matters related to various aquatic products organizations. The fishery economy department is responsible for (1) reducing production costs; (2) stabilizing finance; (3) facilitating transportation and sales; (4) controlling trade. The fishery technology department is responsible for (1) fishing technology; (2) aquaculture technology; (3) manufacturing technology. The compilation department is responsible for compiling and translating academic investigations and research reports on the aquatic products industry in various countries. The task of the investigation branch institute is to investigate the various aspects of the fisheries industry in the area. Therefore, the lowest responsibility of the investigation department is (1) investigation of important fishery production areas; (2) investigation of important fishery consumption areas; (3) economic investigation of fishing villages; (4) investigation of trade; (5) technical investigation of manufacturing and aquaculture; (6) economic investigation of labor and transportation. In addition, due to the length of the article, the investigation methods and various items are not listed in detail. The organization system of the investigation institute is listed below to end this article, and I hope that experts from all over the world will correct it.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Finance: Interbank Call Loan Rate Still Fell During Weekend; Auxiliary Coins Mostly Remained Stable <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the weekend holiday, and most businesses were closed. Although money houses were open as usual, the atmosphere was exceptionally deserted due to the closure of banks and the inability to clear and reconcile accounts. The interbank call loan rate also showed weakness, continuing to fall slightly compared to the previous day. Both the morning and afternoon markets were two points. The transaction of call loan bills was also less than in the past. The turnover in the morning session was over 4.1 million, with 100,000 in new transactions. The turnover in the afternoon session was 300,000, and the turnover in the small general meeting was over 300,000. Money houses cleared and reconciled over 29 million in foreign public bills and over 200,000 in remittances from various routes. In the auxiliary coin market, Jiangjiao small silver coins were 836 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day. The turnover in the morning session was 5,000 jiao, and there was no transaction in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver coins were 750.05 yuan in the morning session and 750.09 yuan in the afternoon session, the same as the previous day. The turnover was 65,000 jiao in the morning session and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins increased by 1,000 compared to the previous day, to 324,506, with a turnover of 34,072 strings and 500 coins, equivalent to 10,500 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>Last week, from April 9 to April 14, the Chinese Securities Exchange's public bond market underwent sudden changes after a four-day Spring Festival holiday. The North China situation became thorny due to the Japanese demand for postal and traffic connections. Huang Fu left Ping to go to Gan, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. The market sentiment was quite panicked. There were many short positions in the market, and the North Gang even sold wildly. The situation on Monday was therefore extremely bad. The entire day declined, with a sharp drop of several jiao to more than three yuan in one day, which was a rare change in recent months. On Tuesday, as the atmosphere eased, various gangs rushed to cover their positions, and retail investors were especially eager to buy. In one day, the three sessions rebounded by several jiao to 1.78 yuan. On Wednesday, the upward trend continued, with No. 75 covering more positions, continuing to improve by 23 jiao to 1 yuan. On Thursday and Friday, the news was dull, Huang Fu still failed to return to Ping, and various parties had different opinions. The North Gang gradually covered their positions, and market prices still rose and fell unevenly, high and low, with a small number. On Saturday, the news of traffic and postal connections seemed to have been resolved, and the atmosphere suddenly eased. A giant household turned from short to long, and the market suddenly became good. No. 11 gradually covered their positions, and market prices rebounded throughout the day, improving by 34 jiao to 1 yuan. As a result of the week's market prices, the gains and losses were mixed, about 23 jiao. The trend has gradually recovered the number that fell on Monday. The total turnover was 116,468,000 yuan. The results of the high, low, rise and fall are compared and listed on the left.</p>

<p>According to the Newfeng Foreign Firm report, based on the Wall Street Journal market report, yesterday's commercial news was good. Yang City's steel workload increased by 3%. The market situation was very stable and the transaction was light. However, a few special preferred stocks still had a sharp rise. Milhua Electric Railway rose sharply by 14 yuan in one transaction to 70 yuan. But the most increased was 16 yuan. West Union Telegraph fell by one yuan. A few kinds of railway also fell by one jiao. The situation of the small exchange was the same as the stock exchange. Bonds have risen for the past two days. U.S. Treasury bonds are also firm due to the successful government debt exchange and the re-recovery of free bonds. The price of goods is slightly lower, and the U.S. dollar has not fluctuated much. Also, the New York agent reported that (securities) were unusually sluggish and there was little change. (Wheat) The market situation was weak, and many bulls sold off. Drought in the producing area made purchases slightly better and seemed to be slightly higher. (Cotton) The general interest in the Punkhai case gradually decreased. Commercial news was still smooth, and the industry bought in, and the market situation was calm. High prices were still waiting for new stimuli. The United States used a total of 543,690 bags of cotton in March. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from each gang was over thirty firms (more than five thousand stones). After the late rice delivery, which was brisk in the earlier market, has turned sluggish. The Nanyang gang was able to select and accept another thousand packages of Zhongguan goods. The Beiyang gang only took in five or six hundred packages of the higher priced goods on the market, and the scrutiny of purchases has tightened. Sellers, citing the scarcity of goods arriving, are still calling for high prices, and are trying their best to hold firm, unwilling to sell easily. The market situation appears stable. The prices of Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sijing, and Xilian goods all stick to old levels. Each gang's thick japonica rice for urban and rural stores is still ordinary, with no significant upward or downward movement. Du Yang, Jian and Yinyuan rice are both just ordinary.</p>

White japonica, Yangjian, Dujian, Bujian, and Bianyuan rice were slightly active. Early thin rice is still not selling well, while Yinyuan and Kejian rice are just ordinary. In terms of price, white japonica, Yang, Du, and Bu Jian high-quality materials are fair, while medium and low-quality materials are slightly sluggish by five or six points. The trend of early thin rice continues to be soft. Bian and Yinyuan goods are scarce and stable, while Kejian rice has not changed much.</p>

<h3 id="e282">Piece Goods: Different Views on the Sales of Flannel <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Flannel sales have increased by one-third in recent years because women choose it as a coat material. However, although women's flannel has a high profit margin, it easily falls out of fashion, so few manufacturers make it. Most of them deal in men's flannel. Currently, both types of flannel are selling well both locally and in other cities, but their sales patterns are different. Sichuan, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, and other places mostly sell high-end goods above six yuan, with no inquiries for women's flannel. In Jingjiang, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places, mostly low-end goods below four yuan are sold. Except for large-scale orders in the capital, women's flannel is rarely touched.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Recent Inquiries for Chinese and Foreign Silk and Satin <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>"Domestic Silk and Satin" Since the Meiya Factory stopped production, small factories have increased their production. Due to the sluggishness of the current silk market, no panic has been seen yet. Regarding the Sichuan Gang, two hundred odd pieces of silk plain silk were loaded yesterday, with a selling price of one yuan and five cents per yard, being a high-quality fabric. There were also some transactions for fancy Tian silk and Power Loom Fabric, totaling fifty odd pieces, with a selling price of one yuan and one dime per measure. The Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou Gangs only slightly purchased. Transactions for thin goods on this street are still fragmented, and prices are still fair.</p>
<p>"Foreign Silk and Satin" Since last month, new goods have continuously arrived, but the quantity is still small. As usual, the scarcity makes the goods expensive, so market prices are trending firm and high. Erqi Shi Rui Tai plain cloth, four yuan and one dime and five cents per yard (increased by two dimes compared to the old price); Sanshi Yi Shi Hua Jia plain cotton cloth, five yuan and eight dimes and five cents per yard (increased by three dimes compared to the old price); Erqi Shi Tian Feng fancy cotton cloth, five yuan and four dimes and five cents per yard (increased by two dimes). Fancy plain silk velvet and Quan silk also continue to arrive, and prices are also firm. Many people are coming to purchase, mostly selling directly to the market by silk and satin shops.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Oil Market: White Tung Oil is Becoming Increasingly Weak <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Since white tung oil was sold by foreign firms in Hankou for twenty-seven yuan and six dimes, the market has gradually shown signs of weakness. For several days, foreign firms have not discussed transactions, so the situation is trending towards softening. Although there are currently no transactions, the opening price will likely not be a large drop. The opening price of cargo by Hankou firms has already fallen to slightly above twenty-one yuan, while the price for Zhi Tong oil is around twenty-one yuan. Zhejiang Tung oil initially echoed the Hankou market, once exceeding twenty-two yuan per dan in river transactions, but has now also fallen to around twenty-one yuan. In short, after the market reaches a peak, a decline is naturally possible. Furthermore, foreign firms in Hankou repeatedly suspend purchases after seeing the market rise. Since domestic sales cannot be stimulated, everything relies on foreign sales as the main body, so the rise and fall of the market entirely depends on the presence or absence of foreign sales. Local firms in this port mainly rely on domestic sales, so they are not very interested in this price surge and still respond with a silent attitude. Very few are currently purchasing. Now that they see prices falling, it seems to have been anticipated. After all, spring sales were too dismal, so even a rise and fall is not enough to stimulate interest.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Gandhi's Victory <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Huan Sheng</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi, who advocated non-cooperation to seek the independence and liberation of the Indian nation, advised his countrymen on the seventh of this month: "For the sake of freedom, temporarily suspend civil resistance." As soon as this advice was issued, the British considered that "Gandhi's move will greatly affect the national situation, and it is felt that there should be some kind of reciprocal gesture. Therefore, non-cooperative political prisoners will be gradually released...The legislative bill on the Prevention of Disorder Ordinance may not be cancelled for a while, but it will be shelved...The order prohibiting the National Congress will also be revoked, and the headquarters of the National Congress and the provincial branches will be allowed to reopen meetings," and so on.</p>
<p>This Gandhi, who is known as the leader of the Indian national movement, has been seeking independence and liberation by advocating economic non-cooperation with his thin and bony figure for many years. He has been imprisoned many times and even resorted to starvation, but he has not been able to obtain any results in the so-called National Conference and Round Table Conference. Now, he has surprisingly obtained the grace and pardon of the British Empire with a small piece of advice, which cannot be regarded as an unprecedented victory in his efforts to promote the national movement.</p>
<p>However, because of this victory, and thinking about the future of the 300 million Indian people, we don't know whether to laugh or cry. Because the ultimate goal of the modern imperialist powers' aggression against weak national colonies is, of course, economic plunder, but maintaining this economic exploitation requires a powerful political, naval, and air military force. If the form of national revolutionary war is not used to crush it, the so-called liberation and independence is nothing more than a dream during deep sleep. This understanding has already made us question what path Gandhi's so-called economic non-cooperation will lead Indian national liberation to. What's more, now that "civil resistance has been temporarily suspended for the sake of freedom," even this point has been abandoned.</p>
<p>In India, where British economic power completely dominates the entire social life, advocating economic non-cooperation, if it can be realized, is tantamount to 300 million Indian people sacrificing for "non-cooperation," starving to death, or else it is a self-deceiving fantasy in the name of liberation and independence for a part of the people. Perhaps it is because India is "a sacred land of purity and inaction, which does not value force," so that non-cooperation can still secretly breed and rise there, but in essence, it is a comical fact of strangling one's own throat and letting others slaughter. Therefore, no matter what Gandhi's noble ideals are in his mind, objectively he is an obstacle to the independence and liberation of the Indian nation in any case. In the sense of blinding the people's minds, diverting them from political struggles and limiting them to passive, non-cooperative actions, in the sense of weakening the people's courage and only relying on economic exclusion without seeking armed resistance, it is more accurate to say that Gandhi is the culprit of this movement than to say that he is the leader of Indian national independence and liberation.</p>
<p>Now Gandhi is changing again and again, from non-cooperation to "temporarily suspending civil resistance," so that the goal that the British could not achieve by enticing participation in the Round Table Conference with preferential treatment in prison has been realized all of a sudden. How can this not make the hardworking British "express their joy"? Especially after the armed disturbances in northern India not long ago, it is natural that this trend cannot be allowed to rise, and there is much reliance on this old man. This is why the British "bestow imperial grace," and Gandhi has achieved the victory of non-cooperation.</p>
<p>The British call Gandhi's advice "the new doctrine of non-resistance." Of course, the old ones will celebrate upon hearing it, "Our doctrine is not isolated." But judging from the merits of the new ones, one can't help but feel "ungrateful."</p>

<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>How exciting should an exceptional Saturday afternoon be for me, who is spinning in the vortex of life every day? Everyone is looking forward to the arrival of this day, and I have thought so too, when I am working. Wouldn't it be great if I could spend every day like Saturday? I can sit all day, doing nothing, and be a happy person. Saturday finally came as I hoped, but my restless heart is hoping it will pass quickly, and tomorrow will be better, for it is Sunday. I can't rest, I have to work like a horse, every day, every hour, so that I have no time to think about the past, and the past cannot be replayed in my mind. But Saturday has come, this is a day of rest. After lunch, I sat leisurely on the sofa smoking, rejecting every invitation from my colleagues, staring at the ceiling in a daze. One cigarette after another, can I sit like this for a day? Finally, I asked myself, and stood up and walked out as if I was going to do something. Outside the door is a lively road, people are crowded in trams, in cars, and walking people, shoulder to shoulder, everyone has something to do. And me? I walked past a friend's house and knocked on the door as if I was going to visit him on purpose. I ran up the stairs and pushed open the small room. My friend was lying on the bed reading a book alone. He got up and said, "You came just in time, I'm bored to death!" He yawned lazily. I couldn't help but laugh secretly. There are people who are as bored as I am on Saturday. I walked to his bedside, and the closed book was a copy of Seven Heroes and Five Gallants. We looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Little Hero Ai Hu, superb martial arts?" I said.</p>
<p>"I don't even know what kind of book this is. I just grabbed it and looked at it. I didn't actually see anything. Where did you come from?"</p>
<p>"Just as bored, so I came to see you."</p>
<p>"Let's go for a walk outside." He didn't ask for my consent, put on his felt hat and walked out without looking back. I seemed to think this move was very reasonable and closed the door for him. Walking out of the alley, our pace slowed down at the same time. We looked at each other as if asking "Where to go?" But no one wanted to reveal this meaning, and we kept walking west without stopping.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the French Park." We began to look at the clouds in the sky, wondering if we were thinking that it wouldn't rain today.</p>
<p>"Do you have a pass?" The other person seemed to be moved.</p>
<p>I shook my head and fell silent again. Two bodies dragged forward non-stop, and we walked to the front of a green-walled cinema. People were crowding in in groups of three or five, and they didn't stop. We stared blankly at the huge pictures on the wall for a while, and involuntarily stepped on the stone steps, exchanging four dimes for two tickets in front of the ticket booth. When we went in, the movie had already started. Because we had been here several times, we naturally walked along the wall to the front. In the darkness, we were suddenly stopped by someone, "Four corners here." "Where are the two corners?" we asked.</p>
<p>"In the back."</p>
<p>"Changed the style?"</p>
<p>"Dancing today."</p>
<p>I looked at my friend, I guess he was looking at me too. In the darkness, no one could see anyone, and we retreated to the back and sat down. On the screen was a Western movie from five or six years ago; there were masked bandits, officers, girls, robberies, chases, making the audience in the whole courtyard laugh.</p>
<p>The movie ended inexplicably, followed by dancing. A large number of spectators flocked to the front at the same time, and several Boys stopped them. They could only stand at the very front of the two-corner seats.</p>
<p>Living beauties, fat jade legs, high breasts, tall and round hips, one by one moved onto the stage under the red lights. Fallen Russian nobles, they exposed their flesh, earning the laughter and applause of these spectators.</p>
<p>Squeezed out the door, it was a clear day, the sun shone on the ground and the shadows were scattered. I looked up, "It probably won't rain." That's what I thought in my heart.</p>

<h3 id="e287">Talks by a Japanese Returnee (2) <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Forget Me</p>
<p>In terms of accommodation, hotels in Tokyo cost at least four yuan per day, providing two meals. The quilts are mostly made of cotton, unlike the soft cotton quilts in our country, and their quilts are very thick. It's not very comfortable to use them occasionally, and it's easy to catch a cold. The floors are wiped very smoothly every day, and we may fall when we first go in. Bathhouses in Japan are very cheap, costing five cents each time, so they have developed a habit of liking to take baths. As for public items such as towels and soap, everyone has to bring their own to emphasize hygiene.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, it is especially convenient in Tokyo. The so-called Dongyang cars (rickshaws) are taller than the ones here. The fare is about one yuan each time. The rickshaw pullers only need to pull two or three times a day and then they stop working. Cars are as dense as a net, soliciting business on the street. As long as you raise your hand to signal, the car will come over to pick you up, costing about fifty cents each time (equivalent to about half a yuan in China). Trams, no matter how far, cost only five cents. There are also elevated street railways, with train tracks erected above the air at every busy intersection. In addition, there are many underground railways, which, together with the large number of cars, will help in future wars. Moreover, the underground passages are very large. Once there is a war in Tokyo, they can also accommodate the city's elementary school students to continue their studies, which is not only convenient for transportation. Speaking of preparations for war, the Japanese are always looking at the bottom line. For example, the tall school buildings of elementary schools have flat roofs that are not intended to be used as playgrounds. In case of an emergency, anti-aircraft guns can be erected on top. Moreover, there must be an elementary school every so many roads. Recently, almost one elementary school is built every month. In this way, Tokyo's air defense facilities have become much more convenient.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say something about the virtues of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Japanese culture was originally passed down from China, so "respect" is highly valued. They not only respect people, but also respect gods. There are shrines everywhere, and everyone who passes by has to salute the shrine. And these so-called shrines are empty inside! Every loyal minister who has made contributions to the country, after his death, becomes another god, whom the people of the whole country admire. As for mud sculptures of Buddha statues, they certainly exist. The Japanese can also achieve the word "diligence," which can be seen from the recent progress. There are also many museums, zoos, botanical gardens, etc., which cultivate an interest in scientific research, so Japanese culture is a fusion of Chinese and Western cultures, and is the culture of a progressive country.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Living Together Until Old Age <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I have a matter concerning my friend, please reply in the Amateur Mailbox immediately after receiving this letter. Not only will my friend be grateful, but I will also be very grateful. Writing this, I respectfully wish you good health. Respectfully, Wen Hui.</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Chen, is a former businessman who met an eighteen-year-old girl in February last year and fell in love with her; their feelings are very passionate. The girl's father passed away in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and her mother, due to family circumstances, promised her daughter to a farmer in the same village as a child bride. At that time, she was married into the family as a child bride. Later, her husband's family decided on an auspicious day in October last year to get married. As soon as she got the news, she resisted vehemently and even wanted to commit suicide, but to no avail. She was forced by her mother and still married her fiancé involuntarily. Of course, the opinions of both parties are incompatible, so she is now determined to live together with my friend until old age, otherwise she would rather commit suicide. Please give me a complete solution to this difficult problem. The questions are:</p>
<p>(1) If my friend denies living together, how can it be resolved?</p>
<p>(2) Is it a crime for my friend to live together with her?</p>
<p>(3) What procedures should she go through to divorce her husband so that it can take effect?</p>
<p>(4) If she cannot leave my friend, what should she do?</p>
<p>Answer: This problem is very difficult to solve satisfactorily in the current society. Because first of all, it is very difficult for her to divorce her husband. There are two types of divorce: one is negotiated divorce, which means that she and her husband are both willing to divorce, which is relatively easy, but in fact her husband may not agree; the other is divorce by lawsuit, which requires the prior fulfillment of the legal conditions for divorce before it can proceed. According to what you said in your letter, she does not seem to have these conditions yet. As for living together or marrying your friend without getting a divorce, it is even more illegal. Therefore, if she is determined to live together with your friend until old age, but also wants to resolve it legally, I am afraid there is no hope.</p>
<p>So, what should they do? After thinking it over again and again, the editor believes that there are only two paths for them to take. First, although she hates her husband in her heart, if he does not abuse her too much and can get by, then she does not have to insist on living together with your friend. As long as the two of them can be spiritual friends and comfort each other, that is enough. Alternatively, if she really has reasons for not being able to continue living with her husband, then she should resolutely break away from her husband and unite with your friend. Of course, it is best to achieve the goal by proper means, but even if improper means are used, it cannot be said to be bad, and it should be used. Because this kind of marriage is originally unreasonable! Editor</p>

<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>Reading Li Huiying's "Half-Day Homework" in "Free Talk," I learned that the puppet Manchuria also produced a national anthem. The lyrics are like this:</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, there is a new Manchuria:</p>
<p>New Manchuria, there is a new world,</p>
<p>Standing upright, without hardship or sorrow.</p>
<p>Only love creates a new country and</p>
<p>no grudges The people are 30 million,</p>
<p>Even if it is increased tenfold, you will still have freedom.</p>
<p>Value benevolence, and uphold courtesy so that I can cultivate myself.</p>
<p>The family is in order, the country is governed,</p>
<p>What else to ask for? Being near, we assimilate with the world,</p>
<p>Far away, we flow with heaven and earth.</p>
<p>It is said that this song was written by Zheng Xiaoxu. This old man's knowledge is well-founded, so what he writes is naturally vivid and colorful. Unfortunately, he has now lost his mind and is working hard as a slave to his master, so his wording is inevitably upside down and chaotic. Doesn't he know that the puppet country was created by the Japanese single-handedly, and the people of the Northeast are under double oppression, suffering great pain, so that they cannot sleep or eat in peace, and they cannot sit or lie down, and they sing about what "no hardship or sorrow" and what "also get freedom" are like deceptive words, which is extremely absurd! The two sentences, "The family is in order, the country is governed," are even more outrageous! Tens of millions of compatriots in the Northeast are personally tasting the bitterness of "family ruin and national death"! In order to make the name and reality match, I will now revise this false song. The words may not be as sophisticated as the old man Zheng, but the meaning is always more appropriate than his. The song says;</p>
<p>Between heaven and earth, there is a pseudo-Manchuria: In the pseudo-Manchuria, there is a false world;</p>
<p>The sky is dark and the earth is dark, and all kinds of misery and sorrow are known: The false country is created, the rights and interests overflow outwards, and the money flows eastward! The strong city has four provinces, and the people are 30 million,</p>
<p>It is difficult to get freedom with double oppression! The enemy's blood and the traitor's flesh must be eaten before we rest! The family is broken and the country is destroyed, where can this body stay! Today, we will endure humiliation with our compatriots, and tomorrow we will go to Japan to avenge our hatred!</p>

<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>Sixth Master didn't speak, only responded with a grunt, and lay down on the opium couch. The opium lamp was lit, and he picked up his pipe to smoke. Sixth Master was the most authoritative in the clan, so Lian Sun and Gui Sun didn't continue their earlier argument, but just sat in silence. The sound of rain outside the window and the sound of opium smoking inside the house resonated together. Second Master entered. He immediately saw Sixth Master smoking opium, walked closer to the opium couch, sat down, and lay down as well. Sixth Master caught sight of him from the corner of his eye, quickly took the pipe away, exhaled a puff of smoke, and called out, "Second Brother!" Then he took as thorough a puff as possible. After finishing the opium, Sixth Master sat up and said,</p>
<p>"Has Jian Guang returned?" Lian Sun asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Second Master didn't answer. In his heart, he remembered the incident from two years ago and still harbored resentment. Hearing Sixth Master's words, he thought that he still wanted to take in his rebellious son, and couldn't help but feel anger on top of his hatred. After a long while, he sat up from the opium couch. His beard was trembling, and his eyes were wide open. After another long while, he finally spoke.</p>
<p>"Sixth Master, can this kind of son still be taken in? Back when the peasant association was acting tyrannically, wasn't it him who shouted loudly at the farmers' rally in Dong Jiao Chang to overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry, and to first overthrow Second Master Zhao Xian and Sixth Elder Yu Ting? Luckily, many of those beasts in human clothing have now been killed, and our Zheng family has what it has today! Now that he's back, if you don't put him to death, the Zheng family clan will not recognize you, Sixth Master, as Zheng!" As he spoke, he got off the opium couch and started pacing around the house.</p>
<p>The maidservant asked at the door to serve the meal, but Second Master was too angry to pay attention to her. The eldest young master, Lian Sun, hurried to the door and softly instructed to delay serving the meal, saying that there was something going on. A servant brought in a lamp, and the eldest young master, Lian Sun, took it and carried it into the house himself, placing it on the desk. The lamplight illuminated Second Master's body, and his shadow moved on the ground.</p>
<p>Sixth Master remained silent, hanging his head low. Second Master paced around the room and suddenly stopped, saying again,</p>
<p>"Report it to the county government quickly, and ask them to send a core team to your house to arrest him!" Only then did Sixth Master raise his head and say,</p>
<p>"I've also been thinking about that. However, this method is not very appropriate."</p>
<p>"Why is it not appropriate?" Second Master, thinking that Sixth Master was opposing his suggestion, questioned him with an arrogant tone.</p>
<p>"Second Brother knows that, because of this unfilial son of mine, the yamen back then threatened me, demanding three thousand taels of silver. Later, a lot of money was extorted. If he's said to have returned home this time, won't it cost more money again?"</p>
<p>"What money will it cost?"</p>
<p>"The core team that comes to the house to arrest him, it's unavoidable to give them some money for opium and alcohol. Moreover, I'm also afraid that those snake-eating, tiger-blood-drinking people will take the opportunity to take a few things from you!"</p>
<p>"Then... Sixth Master! What exactly do you intend to do?"</p>
