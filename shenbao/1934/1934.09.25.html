<p>江蘇省政府鍳於天災流行。人事防衛不足的往事。特由財政廳向上海銀行界借欵百萬元。并指定在淮陰淮安高郵泰縣東台與化泰興等七縣。收買米榖。存貯於各縣倉庫。備有饑荒時政府卽以平價出售。藉以詞劑民食同時普通農民。如果有臨時綏急。也可以用米榖向該縣倉庫抵押借欵。其利息爲一分。有人以爲在這災荒己成的時候。纔開始積榖。好像有點太遲。但是我們中國有一句古話。說（亡羊補牢猶未爲晚。）是故亡羊之後。能將羊（牢）補修得很牢固。使他永遠不再亡羊。也確是將來大大的幸福。是現在人民殷殷的最望。况我國農村經濟。進展遲緩。週轉隨着收穫的季節而緩慢。所以祇要能切實辦理。則目前比較豐收的縣分。有調劑的功效。在旱災過重的地方。也有多少間接的帮助。</p>
<p>我們還覺着美中不足的。第一是範圍太狹小。六十縣中僅七縣有此設備。苟遇災荒。抗禦力似尚薄弱。以人口比例而論。上述七縣。也不過占全江蘇人口的八分之一。因此我們以爲這種辦法。應該盡量擴大。非但江蘇全省要有這樣的設施。中國全國。更須有同樣的準備。第二是預備的欵項也太少。我國農村經濟。週轉不靈的病根己深。欵項太少。恐無濟於事。而且容易爲地方不良分子所把持。假使我國金融界十分拮据。固是又當别論。倘若遇遊資過多苦於無法放出的時候。政府如能運用得法。則都市存積的現金。可以重新活動。流回到農村去。間接足以鎭定一般市面衰敗的。</p>
<p>我們中國到現在。雖名爲農業國家。然而對於農村方面經濟的建設。也尚付缺如。因此豐收。會榖賤傷農。歉收會死亡載道。今後在消極方面建設。至少要樹立起米榖國策。使豐收不成災嫌收不致於流離失所。國立省立縣立的倉庫。該趕快籌備設立。公調劑民食。日本非完全的農業國。而其存米。竟有一千三百幾十萬石。雖是他另的作用丨丨戰爭的準備。但於調劑米榖。也不無幾分效力的。况且現時代中。歐亞兩洲。到處發生火藥的臭味。幾時會爆發戰爭。是難於保證的。像我們這樣的農業國家。工業旣不能和别人爭勝。至少食糧出産。要做到自給自足。卽使遇到海外交通杜絶的時候。也不怕没有養命之元。然而要做到這樣預備的工作。須得大大的努力。遍設倉庫。帮助農業生産。卽是很有效的一方策。</p>
<p>我國要應付當前的非常時期。誠然要注重人民主要食糧丨丨米榖。尢需要有進一步的管理方法。在生産者農民方面。須使他們安心工作。不至於辛苦經年。而不得一飽所以對於米榖生産費用。要有比較週詳的計算。根據這種計算。而設爲米榖價格的調劑。如市價跌至最低價格以下時。卽由國立省立或縣立的倉庫。出而大量收買米榖。農民就可不致吃虧。農村經濟。也就得有所調劑。有消費者方面。特别是聚積於都市的工商業者。如果米榖價格過商。就會影響到整個社會關係的。所以要將一般人民的收入丨丨農業以外各業的收入丨丨。加以詳密的調查。以這種調查數字作基礎。再計算生活費的分配。以决定最高的米榖價格。使消費者不致受食糧價格過主的威脅。如是。雖未必遽能調劑都市與村不均衡狀態。但也可以减少雙方的痛苦。訓練一般社會如遇非常時期的準備。</p>

<p>大會入最後階段日内閉幕</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇聯加入國際聯盟後、國聯方面對於勸導美國入會在著意進行中、今日國聯會長桑特勒氏特爲嘴事、用無綫電向美國全美人民廣播演說、該項演說係自日内瓦傳至美國、再行分播於全美各地、桑氏之演說至爲委婉動聽、其中之最要點爲（蘇俄現己歸向國聯、故世界尚有一最偉大之國家、如能早日加入、實屬全歐人民所至期望者）至、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<p>意塞交惡力謀調停</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法外長巴爾都又赴日内瓦、其得要任務有三、卽保障奥國獨立計劃、擱淺中之東歐羅迦諾公約及薩爾投票自决問題是也、巴黎各報亦均以此三事爲其論據、小巴黎人報謂薩爾問題在本屆國聯會中不能有何進步、至於東歐互助公約、該報則謂德雖反對、波蘭雖冷談、此計劃絶未放棄、旦其間若干關鍵己經解决、惟公開封論之時機尚未成熟耳、巴黎日報則謂巴爾都之往日内瓦與保安大計劃有關、此項計劃以國際保障奥國獨立及調整經濟關係爲其兩砥柱、此二點實在爲表裏、其解决辦法全視意大利與南斯拉夫之關係爲轉移、而此二國今方背道而馳也、馬爾都將爲此二敵國之和事老云、（二十四日國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）國聯會目下工作情形大致如下、現有兩委員會工作業己完竣、卽第一委員員（研究法理與組織問題）與第二委員會是、凡經濟財政及技術問題由第二委員會研究之、如法商長賴穆爾所提議推廣抵賬辦法、卽係由該委員會審查者、至於研究預算問題之第四委員會、並未遭遇多大困難、星期二卽可竣事、研究人道及社會問題之第五委員會亦然、至若軍縮問題之第三委員會、今年未嘗組織、蓋旣有軍縮會議、卽便再有此項委員會也、</p>

<p>大約星期二行政院會議中、或僅討論薩爾問題、或至少於非公開會議中如此、蓋自薩爾投票委員會揭發德國人在薩爾各種行動之後、行政院欲以某種方法唤醒德國人、使之尊重其對薩爾問題所作之諾言也、因此行政院定必於十一月舉行特别會議、以便視察薩爾問題之進展、並依據薩爾問題三人委員會之報告、（三人委員會以　大利代表阿樂亞西爲主席）研究法國最近所提關於薩爾之備忘錄、此際法外長巴爾都將再與英·意·俄·小愶商各國接洽、以是會外接洽之重要、反居國聯會工作之上、</p>

<p>折衷價格一億七千萬</p>
<p>（東京）　中東路讓渡交涉、前因（滿洲國）代表退出東京、表面上陷於停頓狀態、其後廣口外相與駐日俄使迭次折衝、同時太田大使在莫斯科與朔哥爾尼哥夫外交人民次長斷續數次交涉之結果、始發見解决之曙光、蘇聯方面表示讓步之意、讓渡價格亦表示與廣田案接近之意、廣田外相卽將此旨通告（滿洲國）外交部、决在東京開第三次蘇滿代表會議、大橋次長己於二十二日晚出發長春、俟其抵東京卽正式再開中東路讓渡交涉、（二十四日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　聞中東路售價由日外相廣田疏通後、雙方允各讓步、計日幣一萬七千萬元、内有三千萬元爲俄路員遣散津貼費、原來俄國索價一萬九千萬元、而（滿）方祇允一萬五千萬元、相差四千萬元、今則各讓步二千萬元、以期成此交易、衆料俄（滿）將於數日内復開會議、因（滿）代表己應廣田之招起程前來東京、開會時將正式議定付欵辦法、聞其大旨如下、全數三分之二以貨物抵付、餘爲現金、一半現付、一半分三年償清、所有俄籍路員、須於出售合同簽定後六個月内一律解職、而其遣散津貼按年償付、三年付清、所有資産與債務、不列入中東路清戰者、槪由蘇俄收　　（東京）　聞中東路之出售價格、結局由（滿州國）方面更進一步承認一億七千萬圓之妥恊案、似此趨勢觀之、則大橋與優列尼夫之交涉倘能迅速進展、則其臨時調印或可於十月中告一結束、同時日蘇兩國間横亘之漁業問題以及國境問題等等糾紛、今後亦可由日蘇兩國進行折衡、而達到圓滿解决之境地、便此間大橋氏與優列尼夫氏之交涉、其最後如何結束、均爲一般人士所注目、（廿四日聯電）</p>

<p>（一）讓渡價額、中東路及附屬事業一億四千萬、蘇俄職員退職金三千萬、共計一億七千萬日金、（一）訂立讓渡條約或締結恊定、於交涉成立時、應將中東路所有權移歸（滿）國、（一）兩國政府於簽訂該條約或恊定後之一個月以内、任命接收委員於三個月内接收完竣、（一）價額之支付、三分之一以現金、三分之二爲物品、現金内先付二分之一、其餘二分之一分年支付、（一）蘇俄職員於交涉成立後六個月内、全部退職、退職金於三年内支付、（一）蘇俄政府對於一九一七年三月九日以前所有北鐵一切股東、社債債權者及其他債權者、應負一切責任、（一）蘇俄政府對於該日以後、迄交涉成立所發生北鐵對第三者所負之一切債務、統歸蘇俄負責、（二十四日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）　東路讓渡交涉若成立、日俄（滿）間之和平工作基礎、或可確立、故廣田外相將繼内田前外相於昭和七年十二月所提議蘇俄不侵犯條之對案、提議設立三國共同國境委員會、俄方對此、於原則己表明無異議、因此中東路交涉完畢後、十一月上旬廣田外相與尤禮尼夫大使間將會談該問題、又廣田外相於該委員會外、擬有在國境綫兩方設一定距離之非武裝地帶案、故日俄（滿）間之和平工作、將乘此東路交涉成立之機會進行之、（二址四日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據可靠方面消息、中東路非法交涉極不易收效、其理由如下、（一）廣田外相雖渴望交涉圓滿結束、以實現其和平外交之第一步、且企圖依此博得軍部之信用、（二）軍部對中東路認爲（布袋中之老鼠）、不值出錢購買、又鑒於逮捕大批俄路員後、俄方未有積極行動、竟認爲俄軍亦不足畏、（三）但俄方實因加入國聯問題未告完畢、東方和平恊定亦未獲果、日軍集結北滿、作種種挑釁行動、際此時期、俄方不得不爲緩和日軍空氣、且利用廣田與軍部意見之相背、俄使故意向外務省表示讓步、使其牽制軍部之積極論、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　曾爲俄國過去七十年間遠東政策唯一立足塲之中東路、今以廣田外相斡旋之結果、歸屬於（滿洲國）此事非獨在歷史上有重大意義、且因蘇聯抛棄中東路、其遠東政策有根本析變化之政治的意義、蘇聯最近參加國聯、訂立法俄同盟、安定西部空氣、同時實行安定遠東之政策、其結果卽使近來達到惡化極點之日（滿）與蘇聯之國交關係、急轉直下矣、（二十四日日聯電）</p>

<p>由呈社吳性載等另組遠東貿易公司</p>
<p>前日有人送往炸彈一枚警告信一封</p>
<p>上月間、本市西顔料業同業公會方面、自忽接署名爲國靑年團密函一通及另一匿名信、控告該業商號中如呈祉吳性栽·瑞泰李叔彦·瑞和吳仁葆·裕康王鵬程·德和公記邱洪生·公和來沈覲舜·等有以遠東貿易公司名、向日商包銷靛靑達三百萬金、一百希圖壟斷市塲等情後、該業公會、因不容忽視、乃召集會議、商議處置辦法等情、己誌前報、但迄今未見若何進展、茲將調查所得、記述於下、想一班關心社會人士、定當不等閒視之也、</p>
<p>另組公司　據悉此次上述商號組織遠東貿易公司、實専爲包銷日靛而設立、並爲避免德孚洋行·南星洋行、汽巴顔料廠·等之合同糾紛起見、故始决以遠東貿易公司出面、向日包銷、暗中仍由彼等操縱、其總額確爲三百萬金、由各該商號分攤存囤、兼有投機於萬一之意、</p>
<p>貨將運到　根據昨日確息、得悉該項日靛、原價每筒價值五十兩、則三百萬金計有六萬筒之鉅、本定本月初旬間交貨、嗣經旁者發覺、及發生德商德孚洋行向各該承銷商號提起嚴重質問後、恐生枝節、乃於無形中暫時擱置、但暗中仍進行甚力、最近期内己有到滬之可能</p>
<p>乘機操縱　至於該商號等定包日靛之起意、據該業中人稱、實由於袁東局勢之不定而起、以彼等預料、將來遠東局勢、一旦爆發、德靛等來源、勢將發生困難、屆時奇貨可居、則獲利當較十倍於原來進價、同時以市塲上之需要、更可乘機操縱於一時也、</p>
<p>炸彈一枚　此事發生後、各商號雖曾一度登報啟事、表示否認、但以未澈底追查、及無結果宣示、故仍未能爲一班人士所諒解、致前日呈祉顔料號突被人投送炸彈一枚、並附警告信一封、斯函内容、雖未得見、但據揣測、恐不外乎愛國行動也、</p>

<p>親筆自願書十條全文</p>
<p>詳述黄與女性之瓜葛</p>
<p>自黄焕成律師失踪事件發生後、本報曾經披露、連日各報亦繼起刋載、惟據前日某報紀述、謂黄本人現在鎭江、有函致其同事張世英律師、並由張律師向之闡明黄此次突然摒棄家庭、隻身出亡之原因、本報記者爲審愼將事起見、昨日特遍訪本件主要人物宜興女子陳紀英、及黄·陳當時締婚之主要介紹人周君、獲得各種材料甚夥、茲詳誌於下、</p>
<p>陳女士語　昨日午後、記者往訪陳紀英女士、得下列之談話（以下皆陳女士語、）余於去冬由周鏡明與鄭勝廣二君之介紹、與黄相識、當時黄卽百般獻媚、誓欲娶余爲室、余因黄出身高尚、執業優良、遂允其請、黄當時且力稱初婚、年齡祇二十七歲、但余爲審愼起見、在今春結婚時、除周·鄭·兩介紹人外、特另請多人證明、以資愼重、</p>
<p>黄焕成陳紀英李惠芳</p>
<p>自願書文　陳女士言時、卽探篋取出黄之親筆自願書一紙相示、茲照錄於下、一立自願書人黄焕成、年二十七歳、十月十九日辰時生、陳紀英、年二十二歳、八月十三日酉時生、緣因雙方情投意合、自願共相偕老、謹將條件開列於右、（一）自立志願書後、坤方爲乾方家屬之一員、乾方應負担坤方終身之生活等費、（一）雙方志願偕老終身、非一方違反本約、他方不得半途悔攺、（一）坤方須繼續讀書、一切費用、由乾方供給、（一）坤方之母、乾方應負赡養之責除坤方之母外、不負任何人之赡養、（一）本件非買賣性質、亦非誘拐情事、立約人固不得控訴、外人更不得藉此敲詐、（一）自立志願書後、所生子女、視爲婚生子女、（一）坤方應追隨乾方隨鄕入鄕、但乾方不得無故將坤方留置異鄕獨居、（一）自立約後、雙方均不得有不端或不道德之行爲、互相均得監視規勸、（一）乾方應給坤方禮金三百元正、（一）本約一式二紙雙方各執爲憑、中華民國二十三年二月十日、立志願書人黄焕成押、陳紀英押、乾方見證人凌文杰扦、坤方見證人陳儲氏十、介紹人王春陽正、吕海靑十、王靑山十、唐鴻軍十、周鏡明押、鄭勝廣扦、</p>
<p>崔張兩氏　陳又續稱、余自與黄婚後、日久見黄態度大變、且彼家中來信、黄則諱莫如深、余遂大起疑竇、凡事卽加以注意、某次、有黄之親戚自泰州來滬、余乃乘機探其家事、始悉黄原籍確有大婦、婦崔氏、己生一子一女、民國十八年黄來滬、任亞陸中學敎授時、曾將泰州北門外良家張姓女子誘惑挈滬、將張送入梅白克路坤範女學、當時黄亦誓言與張結婚、詎事後黄竟抛棄不顧、嗣後張姓女子卽懊喪而回鄕、現己憂憤成爲瘋癲病、</p>
<p>又訂一婚　取出照片一幀及訂婚之請柬一紙相示、照上用鋼筆書就（焕成兄惠存、妹李蕙芳特贈、）等字樣、請柬上刋（焕成蕙芳、由陳懋雲·彭鐵瑚·兩先生介紹、經雙方之同意、及得家長之允許、謹於民國十九年十二月十四日訂婚、専此奉聞、黄焕成·李蕙芳·同啟、）等字樣、據陳聲稱此李女士黄亦與之訂婚、但後仍被黄遺棄、故嗣後黄在滬執行律務、凡遇當事人托其代理登報啟事時、黄輒用黄律師三字出之、焕成兩字、初不敢用、蓋恐李女士興師問罪耳、</p>
<p>解釋兩點　陳女士最後聲稱、謂黄之此次對余意存遺棄、蓋己成爲不可諱掩之事實、至於有人謂余染有惡嗜好、及余係某宦之下堂妾、而爲此次黄出走之原因、更不值識者一笑、關於第一點、余近數月來、香烟均一槪摒絶、遑論其他、至於第二點、更屬無稽之談、卽退一步言、余於兩點俱備、則亦不妨正式言離、又何必悄然出走、形同逃避、此乃愚者所不出此、况黄爲法律家乎、現余己决定主張、一面求法律解决、一面請社會援助、不達目的、誓不屈服、</p>
<p>介紹人言　至此記者乃興辭而出、復往訪介紹人同鏡明君、據稱、余（周君自稱）與黄君爲表兄弟行、但相别甚久、對於黄之家事、不甚明晣、如當時果知黄有大婦、亦絶不願做此傀儡、總之、此次黄之不告而别、將陳女士背棄不顧、於道德人情、均有不合、但爲愛護黄君計、深盼其能早日悔悟、卽日返滬、正式談判、俾免事態擴大、致貽伊戚云云、</p>
<p>病死瘟猪多至七八十隻、自七·八·九·三個月、共計有四千餘口之多、因此呆猪熬油廠、因不及煮熬　將腐爛不堪之死猪、就地掘池掩埋、以致臭氣四溢、觸鼻難堪、嗅之令人作三月嘔、凡到淞游覽海濱之中西人士、皆掩　而過、吳淞市委唐承宗爲公衆衛生計、曾經呈請市政府飭遷熬油廠等詳情、曾　本報、慈聞目自九月中旬起、天氣轉凉瘟猪雖己大减、每日尚有十餘口、惟日常所積死猪、腹中臓腑等腐臭肚物、殊不在少數、衛生局查騐處、對於是項穢物出脫稍燬問題、頗感困難、據稱在没有辦法中所擬之計劃、以熬油廠附近建築一巨大水門汀池、藏儲死猪臓腑等物、以免臭氣外溢、一面再設法運往遠處掩埋、特具呈市政府請求核准、聞市府己於前日飭令工務局派員蒞淞勘估、惟築池經費約需一千元之譜、刻下衛生局因如許鉅欵、一時不易籌措、現正在計議中、</p>

<h3 id="c177">論創作的主題 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>丨答吳理君丨</p>
<p>（寫什麽好呢）？</p>
<p>據胡君來信說，他每當提起筆來的時候，總是這樣自己問自己，感到没有什麽可寫似的。</p>
<p>這是一個創作的主題問題。凡是初學寫作的人、統統要遭遇着這樣的困難的：有時候是千頭萬緒、無從寫起，這是因爲不知道怎樣去選擇和整理那創作的主題：有時候、是肚内空空，一無可寫，這也是因爲不知道怎樣去認取那創作的主題，主題問題一解决，（凍筆）的情形便自然没有了。</p>
<p>什麽才是創作的主題呢？簡單地說，主題就是文章的骨幹。一幢房子；棟梁便是房子的主題，如果用文學上的話語來講，主題是作品所表現的眞實，所描寫的中心問題。，主題與材料（題材）是有分别的。社會上的各種現象，在與作者未發生關係，客觀地獨立存在着的時候，呌做題材，一經作者主觀的選擇，整理，拿來寫成作品時，那便不是單純的題材而是主題了。譬如；旱災吧，旱災這一觀客的事實，我們只能說是當前創作上的偉大題材，因爲在它未經作者認識，而早己獨立存在時，它只是一種現象，它是否被作者寫入作品還在不知之列，但倘經作者認取，寫成作品，整理成一個有系統的故事、儘量暴露了它的現實性，于是旱災才成了那作品的主題。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c178">諺語的記錄 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>在各地方言裏，最精彩的部分，我以爲是謠語，諺語，謎語，諧語，四種。謠語就中歌謠，諺語謎語不待解說，諧語如歇後語酒令語之類。</p>
<p>暫且僅拿諺語一項來說罷。</p>
<p>諺語是口頭語裏的警句，又是常常用做口頭語裏的格言。郭紹虞在（諺语語研究裏）說：</p>
<p>諺是人的實際經騐之結果，而用美的言詞以表現者，於日常談話可以公然使用，而規定人的行爲之語方。</p>
<p>郭先生下的這個諺語定義是很對的。在現代，諺語的研究，好像是從他開頭；諺說的記錄，成爲單行册子，我還只看見葉德均的淮安諺語集。</p>
<p>葉先生的這部諺語集是很薄薄的一本、諺語二百七十五則，農諺四十四則，歇後語二百則。當然，作者注意的範圍只在一鄕一縣，而且個人聽到的限有，記得出的也有限，能够做到這樣的成績，己經很不容易了。</p>
<p>記得我初進中等學校的時候，看見一部一法通，作者是臨湘吳獬。提起吳獬，在湖南，此人大大有名，他是一個老名士。聽說吳子玉師長駐軍岳州的時候，知道這位老名士很窮，贈他大洋幾百元。不知道是師長的部下呢，還是落伍的北方散兵，聽到老名士居然有一天大進欵，就到家裏去（打起發），把七十多歳的老名士嚇死了。如今還使我們湖南有幾個人記得這位老名士的，就靠他有一部呌（一法通）的書。</p>
<p>吳鳳蓀老先生著的（一法通）是一部什麽書呢？</p>
<p>這部書我讀過的，有上下兩册。著者把古今諺語依詩韻的次序排列下去，從三字一句的起，到許多句的止，好像（聲律啓蒙）那樣的形式。所以書名（一法通），因起頭一篇是一東的韻，第一句是（一法通，萬法通）的緣故。這部書在吳老先生的故鄕岳陽臨湘一帶很流行，我想如今總還可以買到。這是從明楊愼古今諺等書以來等一部有功於謠俗學的著作。可惜如今我的手邊没有這部書，不能作詳細的介紹。倘若有人能够替我買來這部書，那就不勝歡躍欣感　之至！</p>
<p>在清人諸畮香的明齋小識卷八裏有（吳下諺聯）一條，說是王觀國民鄕，蠻多感慨，後來老了，撰集吳下諺聯四卷，其中有許多做得又好又巧的。五言如丨丨丨</p>
<p>虎頭上捉虱，描金石卵子，</p>
<p>貓口里挖鰍。黑添皮燈籠。</p>
<p>鍾馗捉小鬼，坑缸前土地，</p>
<p>羅漢請彌陀。座台上鄕紳。</p>
<p>眼飢肚裏餓，筆管裏煨鰍，</p>
<p>嘴硬骨頭酥。床底下摸蚌。</p>
<p>熱氣换冷氣，眼晴紅盼盼，</p>
<p>大蟲欺小蟲。肚腸白條條。</p>
<p>七言如丨丨</p>
<p>帶累鄕鄰吃薄粥，</p>
<p>攛掇老爺煨沙鍋。</p>
<p>銅錢眼内穿觔斗，</p>
<p>螺獅殻裏做道塲。</p>
<p>羊去喫草鵝去趕，</p>
<p>鷄來討債鴨來愁。</p>
<p>東手接錢西手送，</p>
<p>南天落雨北天晴。</p>
<p>雌鷄雄鴨短頭布，</p>
<p>快刀熱水乾手巾。</p>
<p>八言十言如丨丨</p>
<p>小囝吃蘿葡，逐橛剥；</p>
<p>和尚無頭髮，樂得推。</p>
<p>娘要嫁人，天要落雨，</p>
<p>富不敎學，窮不讀書。</p>
<p>養媳婦故媒人，自也難保；</p>
<p>老和尚看狗練，我不如他。</p>
<p>九言如丨丨</p>
<p>老壽星吃砒霜，活厭了；</p>
<p>閻羅王開飯店，鬼不來。</p>
<p>止顧羊卵子，弗顧羊性命；</p>
<p>單見羊吃水，不見羊撒尿。</p>
<p>這部吳下諺聯，組織雖然工整凑巧，我想總不免有攺變諺語原來的字句，適合對仗的地方。撰集到四卷之多，不能不佩服他肯費如許的氣力，雖說在他不過看做游戲，消遣。但不知道這部書有刻本否？倘若没有刻本，又不知他的後裔或是别的藏書家存有稿本否？這倒是一部在謠俗學上很有用的書，可以和吳獬的一法通合刻一起。</p>
<p>有人說，白話文裏語彚太少，詞藻不够，須在文選等書裏面去找，誰也知道這是可以不必的。</p>
<p>實在說。我們肯用接近大衆一點的說言文字做文章，除了外來語新造語要用的不算，有時還得必須借重幾個淺近一點的字眼以外，儘量從民間口頭流行的活言語裏去找語彚，詞藻，更是必要的。因此我希望各地人士，能够分出一點時問，稍用一點工夫，把本鄕本土的諺語，用自己認爲最好的方法，記錄起來，這也是我們實踐物工作一部分。</p>

<p>— 林三</p>
<p>長沙的這班人，什麽舉動都做得出來，比方不穿襪子或者袒胸露臂的女人從街上走過，會有許多好閒者駡她爲（妖精），（洋婆子），（亡國奴）。厲害一點的，他還要用石子打她。如果有一對靑年男女並肩走着，（注意，在長沙絶對找不出换手走的中國男女·）一切人都會將視綫集中在他們身上，並且做着鬼臉羞她，後面更會跟着一大堆閒人駡着：（死不要臉的醜東西！）（醜鬼！）（那里來的一對妖怪！）</p>
<p>有位同學和她的先生新從法國歸來，因爲没有中服就穿了西裝，高跟鞋，在街上走，於是駡聲載道，害得她幾乎不敢出來，連忙買了布來趕製旗袍。我問她：（你挨過石子打没有？）（幸而好，還没有被打過，可是駡就挨够了！）她說時大搖其頭，好像不相信素來文明的長沙會有這種現象發現的。</p>
<p>其實他們也只能在長沙出出風頭，假若到了上海，漢口，香港一帶到處都是（妖精），駡之不勝其駡了。（續完）</p>

<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>（就是那個抽壯丁的呀！）冬生瘸手裝自老在行的神氣。好像說，這張告示，自己是讀了一個通夜的。</p>
<p>（不是前幾天己經貼出過了嗎？媽的！）大脚瘋木仁老坐在翠竹亭横柱子穿着的條木上，接過來說。</p>
<p>（貼出過，但給撕去了！不知那個烏龜老王八！）冬生瘸手本來很少用這頗階級性的駡語（王八蛋，）但近來和衙門裏人接近的多了，也就有點學會過來。但還加上土駡（烏龜）省了一個（蛋）字。</p>
<p>（撕夫！）一個年靑的農人，道狗，大着聲音呌。（不撕去又怎麽，誰又去幹這烏勾當。）</p>
<p>（哼！看你不去！看你道狗硬得起！）冬生瘸手伸出那隻生薑節子那樣的手，指着道狗。）全村七十二個壯丁！册字造好了的，上頭有名字。看你不去！看你不去！）</p>
<p>壽夫矮大砲看在一旁，仲了伸舌子，說聲：（呵！）便轉了轉身，在亭子口石地閥上，捧着頭蹲住。</p>
<p>（我又不會呌你們去！）冬生瘸手頗善詞令，先把這件事和自己干係卸清，接着他來了一大套：（你不去，我更好。難道咱們村裏，少得了你那樣一尊大砲嗎？不過，事情怕没　這樣容易。上頭底話己經講出了，辦總得要辦的。旣然要辦，有名字的，也總得要去的。）</p>
<p>（哼！）開暘麻皮却不信。（名字開了去，有什麽用。咱那額角上又没雕字！祇要村裏人，大家口子守得緊，不說出誰是誰，看他呌誰去。）</p>
<p>這道理可着實，全亭子裏的人都（呵呵！）地笑了。面上立刻走上幾條亮光。</p>
<p>冬生瘸子似乎給難住了。也没話說。接着道狗那小夥子。駡：（祇有狗會咬人，誰咬出誰來，誰就是狗。）</p>
<p>駡着，各人眼睛全掃到冬生瘸手身上。冬生瘸手這時立刻明白自己是個鄕警。他媽的，鄕警眞不是人當的！有口飯吃！一定不幹這鳥差使！</p>
<p>在衆目齊攻之下，冬生瘸手爲躱避起見，把眼睛穿過凉亭，往街上看去。恰巧看到茂隆號門外那塊門牌。</p>
<p>（哼！哼！）冬生瘸手立刻振起喉頭來。（看你們不去！看你們不去！没人說，你們也得去你們祇要看看這個東西好了。）冬生瘸手，舉起那隻不瘸的手，豎直中指，往茂隆號指去。茂隆號門外，此刻正站着個（壯丁）阿召。阿召看冬生瘸手在指他，以爲有什麽事，走了過來。看阿召那付頽喪祉神氣，似乎跟誰閙過了架。</p>
<h3 id="c182">深海奇觀 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>地球上有生物的部分，要算海底爲人們知道的最少了。我們對於深海生活的智識，全憑幾種魚的標本得來，那些魚都在死了以後，在網在撈到不面的。</p>
<p>紐約動物會科學研究科主任皮白博士因爲要探求第底生活的智識，曾在一九三○年和一九三二年用一種没水新法，入海多次。他靠了巴頓氏技術上的輔助，製成一個兩噸重的鋼球。這球四面不通風，裝置融化石英製成的小窗，由這小窗可以看見水中的一切。他和巴頓氏坐在球内，没人爾莫達島（西印度羣島和紐芳蘭島之間）外深海中，將近二十次，曾到達二千二百呎的深處，這是生人所達海中的最深點。今年夏季他得了華盛頓全國地理學會捐助的一筆鉅欵，今後還要繼續他的深海生活的觀察。</p>
<p>他們每次没水，先由一大貨船，將那鋼球載到汪洋大海之中，然後將球徐徐縋下。球内有一架有力的探照燈，時時射出白光，將奇異的海洋深處照耀得透明。這時有許多球莖狀發燐光的怪魚，被亮光吸引，如織梭般的游過光綫。皮白博士的臉貼近窗邊，將目覩的一切，對電話簡講述。貨船艙面却坐着一位速記員，耳上套着電話聽筒，手中拿着記事簿，將皮白博士的話用縮寫法記下。</p>
<p>這球的外殻，用厚一寸半的精鋼製成，裏面架上放清測量器，温度計，和其他科學儀器。還裝了幾個養氣櫃，因爲從海面到没水人所達的深處，是不能抽取空氣的。每櫃有自動機關，每分鐘放出養氣兩公升。還有鐵絲架兩座，一架有氱化鈣，是吸收濕氣用的，一架有鹼石灰，是消除空氣中過分二氱化炭用的。球到了海深處，球中的人是靠微微高壓的空氣生存。今年夏季，没水，又裝了闊三寸長八寸融化石英做成的新窗數面，融化石英是世界上最堅固最透明的物質，能够抵抗水下極高度的壓力。</p>
<p>這球有一扇供人出入的小門，重四百磅。办進球的時候，須爬過横擋，很費周折，然後將門舉起，放進槽内，用螺釘絞畢，再用鐵鍾敲緊，那響聲幾乎把球内的人耳朶震聾。在出球的時候，更覺艱難，皮白博士雖是一位探險老手，但每次出球，總辊面無人色。</p>
<p>一切佈置妥貼，然後用有力的起得機，將球從船面提起，移向船邊，徐徐縋入海中。球的動量和在水時間的久長，都聽球中電話的指揮。球旣停在某種深度，球内的人，便從事觀察。</p>
<p>當球向海底下降的時候，水中的光，漸漸地减小，水的壓力，漸漸地增高。一轉眼，經過純藍色的浮面魚層，入於半明半暗的區域，在這裏可以看見一切。再往下降，便如墨水一般黑暗，球便停住。這時距離海面己有半哩深了，這裏的水，非常的冷，差不多毫不流動，水的壓力極大，所以從這深處取得的魚。到了水面，常常會迸裂的。</p>
<p>皮白博士曾說：（在這海洋極深處現出的一種深藍色，難以形容，和我在上層世界所見的一切，全然不同，使我們的視神經昏亂到極點。我們時時思索，時時稱牠燦爛。我屢次拿起書來讀，只覺得空白頁和顔色版全無差别。）</p>
<p>皮白博士没水多次，看見有許多魚長著發光和閃光的器官，那魚的眼睛，都很稅利，能够在黑暗中游行自如。皮白博士在球中看見一簇簇的亮光在水中徐徐地移動。也有跳躍很速的。他用探照燈射視，只見那些都是長條斧頭魚，身上閃閃發光，等到游過探照燈的光綫，身上的光，都消滅了，出了光綫，却又明亮了。那些魚有全黑的，有全紅的，光是從頭上鰓上尾上發出的，有些是從身上兩邊發出的，好像黑夜中燃燈的輪船，從船邊小圓窗洞射出亮光一般。光的顔色不同，有深紅色，有黄色，有淡紫色。有些恒久發光，有些間歇發光，和戲院中燈廣告一般。有一次皮白博士用探照燈四面照視，發見兩個區域都有很多極細的生物，中間隔著廣闊的一段，却寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>一九三二年博士在淺水中下降多次，那球在珊瑚礁中間起起落落，直到球架落入深水才罷。有一次一塊尖銳的珊瑚石，横在水面之下，把球擋住，幸虧上面貨船趕快收練，否則繫球的鋼練纒繞著稅利的珊瑚石，恐怕便要突然中斷，於是古束一聲，那球將如樹枝上的硬壳果落下一般，墜入海底了。博士的没水，可稱己成功現代科學上極大的發見。今後或者能探明　水中的珊瑚和魚如何變成中層水中的珊瑚和魚，再往下降，如何珊瑚絶跡，魚却變成深水中的形狀。海洋學家現在對於這些變化，毫無所知，因爲遞變的區域，凸凹不平，不能佈網，所以總没有透澈視察的方法。</p>

<p>二以一擊敗日人大江</p>
<p>雙打與林續音得亞軍</p>
<p>（本報巴逹維亞特約通訊）本年代表我國出席菲律濱遠東運動會之綱球選　許承基君、乃係南洋荷屬東印度爪哇島之華橋、許君在國内京滬等地、曾有多次之比賽、其技術如何、想祖國同胞知之甚詳、無庸記者再爲贅述、</p>
<p>勝大江　許自滬南歸後、對於網球之練習、更爲積極、其進步亦頗迅速、本月初荷印網球總會在萬隆舉行全爪哇之冠軍賽、報名參加者中國人士皆有、其情况極爲熱鬧、許承基去年曾奪得該賽之冠軍、今年當然不能失此機會、故亦參加、經連日預賽結果、許君仍壓倒各選手、昨日（九月十二日）爲决賽之期、單打組由許君與與日人大江作最後之一戰、仇人相見、分外眼明、此戰之劇烈、可以想見、故未至比賽之時、球塲四週己滿佈觀衆、尤以華僑爲最多、但是日許氏適沾恙、表演不見若何精彩、而日人大江復異常穏健、除反手稍弱外、幾無瑕疵可擊、惟戰至第三盤十對九之局數時、大江力始不支、腿部抽筯、乃迫得宣告棄權、於是本年爪哇網球冠軍、仍爲許氏所奪得、</p>
<p>第盤　至於戰情、記者本擬從略、但爲滿足祖國一般球迷起見、不得不述之於下、查是日雙方戰略、少用高挑球、其所擊出之球、大都旣低且急、許之抽球飛來球及壓球、雖在其身體違和中、猶未失當年本色、喝采之聲、時起四座、許之發球、此次不見猛烈、大江對之、類能擊還、第二盤開始後、許即奪得一局、繼爲大江、造成和局、許又以二對一佔先、大江亦當即追上、且抽氣加油、以二對六奪得第一盤、此殊出人意料之外也、</p>
<p>第二盤　　第二盤之首局、仍屬許氏、然第二局爲大江奪得、且繼續連陷三關、造成一至四之優勢、至是許見猛瀾將倒、始振臂捲袖、沉毅應戰、而得一平分秋色之局面、詎料第九局又爲大江所有、大有被其以四對六結束之虞、差幸許終不負觀衆之期望、又追上一局、成五與五之比、繼而許君利用角球及底綫抽、終能連獲二局、以七比五獲勝、一般觀衆之愁眉苦臉、至是方如風掃殘雲、一捲而去、</p>
<p>第三盤　第三盤繼續後、許君始得觀衆之敵勵、精神頓增、在重壓輕挑之下、佔有三局、嗣爲大江復一局、許君仍佔上風、局數由三對一、四對二、五對二十昇、至是一般觀衆皆認爲最後之勝利、己屢許君、孰料事竟大謬不然、因許偶失一球、大江之勇氣、頓增百培、卒造成五比五之和局、此　令人表示可惜者也、但此後局勢、許始終佔優勢、而大江亦不示弱、步步緊追、乃至十對九之局數後、大江終至一蹶不振而敗北也、</p>
<p>至於男子雙打、許承基亦曾與林續音二人參加、乃敗於蘇瑪等與沙巫約二人之手、僅奪得亞軍也、（九月十三日發）</p>

<p>但三四年來政府、對於辦理不善的大學旣厲行裁併、對於新大學之創設復設、有嚴密之條件、前此浮濫之弊、己稍糾正、至於注重實科、近年又定有種種辦法、（如限制各校文實兩科招生比額之類）因之學校與學生的趨向、亦己大有變更、（本年夏若干個大學招考時、投考文科的學生、遠不及投考實科者之衆、）兼之兩年以來、國立各校經費未嘗停减一部分、大學設備與行政紀律、亦俱有進步、所以就目前情形言、全國専科以上學校、確有進入軋道的趨向、當前的問題、是一在擴充各校的設備、尤其實科方面的設備二是在增加優良的大學師資、現在多數的大學均感優良師資的不足、而現時國内大學因研究所的缺乏、復尚難目植大學師資、故目前尚應一面繼續留學政策、一面擇適當之大學、籌設研究所、三爲保障公立學校經費之安定、救濟成績優良的私校、此外爲鼓勵靑年學子向上與改善學風計、考試任官制度、務須普遍行用、否則學校之成績、將與靑年之出路無闊、政治風氣旣不易改善、學風亦不易攺進、</p>
<p>第二中等敎育的狀况　在現行學制係統中、中等敎育包含着三種中等學校、即普通中學（初中與高中）師範學校、職業學校、民國以來、全國公私立中等學校的進展、在數量方面、可以從下列數字看出、</p>
<p>（甲）校數</p>
<p>民元中學數三七三</p>
<p>民二十中學數一八九二（增加五倍）</p>
<p>中學師範職凿業三種學校數三○二一</p>
<p>（乙）學生數</p>
<p>民元中學學生數五二、一○○</p>
<p>民二十中學學生數四○三、一三四</p>
<p>（約增八倍）</p>
<p>中學師範職業學生數五三七·七五七</p>
<p>（丙）經費數</p>
<p>民元中學經費數三、○三四、七○四元</p>
<p>民二十中學經費數三九、一七一、三八五</p>
<p>（增十三倍）</p>
<p>中學師範職業經數</p>
<p>五四、○五三、三六三</p>
<p>就中等學校的内容而言、誠然至今各地都還有許多不良的學校、在二三個學校衆多的都會、這種學校的成分、尤其顯著、不過近三四年來中等學校的課程標凖、旣經由部訂定、各校程度、己有一個法定的標凖、加之近兩年來中學會考制度普遍强行學校與學生、亦漸不能苟且敷衍、今後一般中學學校程度的提高、可以預計、在訓育方面、全國中學需待攺善的、誠然很多、但己有不少的中學、管理情形確屬完善、目前中等敎育的最大弱点點、便是普通中學的成分特别大、職業學校的成分特别小、據民轼國二十年的統計、三千個在等學校、普通中學校數、占了一千八百餘校、師範學校占八百餘校、職業學校則只占了二百餘校、中等學校學生總數爲五十餘萬人、就中職業學校學生只占四萬人左右、不及全數十分之一如何糾正道種畸形分配、是目前中等敎育的最大難題、近年敎部己責成各省市攺編預算重行分配中等敎育經費、期於民國二十六年以前、各省市普通中學與職業學校的經費、達到約略相當的狀態、</p>

<p>海寗的潮，旣然那麽勢雄力厚，所以住在海寗的人們，常常慮到潮水過塘，灌入内地，有（其魚）之嘆。不料今年大旱，倒不是成了（涸轍之鮒），這眞是第寗人的大不幸？</p>
<p>記得杭嘉湖三屬大旱，在近代，一次是嘉慶十九年，也是甲戌年，到如今恰巧花甲兩周，剛正一百二十年了，災也非常利害。另一次爲咸豐六年（丙辰）的大旱，據聞這一年黄霉雨是有的，六月中旱起，距今也有七十九年。此外雖有（河底向天）之日，爲時甚暫；不似今年之旱，熱度旣超過以前紀錄，時間又有三月之久，入霉卽旱，災到顆粒無收的地步；或許爲自有海寗以來未有之奇災！</p>
<p>禍不單行，海寗地方，本來可以勉强度日，不料兩年來絲市衰落，海寗入所認爲（三春可抵一冬）的生活綫的絲繭，賤到與棉花一般價格，還少人顧問，這樣，海寗人安是而不窮。</p>
<p>直至最近十數日内，始來了幾陣大雨；河道中始得到水，然己不能救活己死之稻。諸君！若使看到海寗的災患薦臻，當也值得一掬同情之涙！</p>
<h3 id="c217">潮從何處來？ <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 玉</p>
<p>潮，從書本上看去，都說進鼈子亹，始發聲如雷，其它此是一句老古話。鼈子亹，係由龕赭諸山將錢塘江分爲三口，龕與文堂河莊諸山間之水道，爲地大亹；文堂河莊諸山與赭山間之水道，爲中小亹；赭山與海寗塘之間爲北大亹；及至現在，龕赭諸山，早己淤成陸地，與南岸拉連，距海己有數十里。所謂鼈子亹，己爲歷史上之陳跡。（亦可云北大亹猶在）然其地點在海寗之西，約在老鹽倉一帶。看潮則皆在海寗，己在鼈子亹以外，太潮爲鼈子亹年激成，可謂無稽。但不妨謂鼈子亹爲錢塘江入海之處，其西爲江；其東爲海，故言江，可引鼈子亹，亦猶吳淞口外之三夾水也。</p>
<p>然則潮從何處來？潮從東海中來。東海中來潮，與一般洋海之潮無異。經乍浦，掠海鹽澉浦而西，但見波浪洶湧，水漲船高，無聲如巨雷銀牆高立之偉觀也。及入尖山口，始見白浪滔滔者，銜成一綫，矗立若銀牆，横江而西，發聲如雷，蔚成世界之奇觀。由此可知海潮之發生，發生於尖山口。</p>
<p>尖山口，何以激成偉大之潮？則由於海口延向東北擴展，外寬而内狹。潮自東北方面入，浩浩蕩蕩；不期愈進而水道愈窄。潮旣爲地形所束，勢不得舒；直趨南岸之潮，又激而北遄，相會於尖山之口。而尖山炎口，礁石林立，塔山塘又横仲於海中，潮經左右激盪，力愈厚，勢益張，遂高湧如牆，驟海面而西進。至八堡等地最爲偉大。抵海寗南門，力稍弛，潮頭己不甚整齊。再至舊時所謂鼈子亹等處，潮頭漸平，無足觀也己。</p>
<h3 id="c218">乾隆皇帝與海寜 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>清高宗不論南北，都有一種傳說，說是；（海寗阳閣老之子），由來己久。究竟如何，即使起清高宗於地下，也不肯說出眞相來。可是故老相傳，清高宗與海寗陳氏，確似有些瓜葛，或許也是後人猜想傳會；然亦不少可作野史資料看。容日有便，當說與諸君爲酒後茶餘之用。此刻單講觀潮，我們就從潮的方面談談乾隆皇帝與海寗。</p>
<p>觀潮諸君，到海塘上，看見巍巍石塘，綿互數十里，值得稱許他的偉大。這海塘就名爲魚鱗塘，比塘的確可與同名異工之明太祖編製的魚鱗册相比，一則釐定了全國的田賦；一則保障了七郡生靈。這石塘如何建築？是用很長的條石，横直相疊，作成階級的形狀，（有如魚鱗，帮名。）高至一丈數尺，塘面（即行人的）條石，再用鐵錠澆嵌堅固，石與石之間代隙，多用鐵屑拌和抿縫，以堵潮水侵蝕。石塘脚底，用數丈長之木段椿實，其外再築有丈許闊之條石坦水，以固塘身，潮流緊急處，並築有兩重坦水，另用木段排列在外，以護坦水。有這樣牢固工程，方可抵禦狂潮的襲擊；然而潮水的力量太大，年深月久，有時仍將石塘一浪捲去，所以在清代，歲修工程頗爲重視。</p>
<p>海寗的塘，在清以前，也有柴塘，也有石塘，可是無現今所留存的石瑭。現今的石塘！魚鱗塘，發動於雍正元年，派尚書朱軾往江浙會議修築海塘事宜，而特别注意在海寗的海塘，臨走的時候，清世宗關照朱軾，說是，（你這趟去勘塘，也所以報答師門，應該要仔細）！因爲朱軾與海寗陳氏有師弟之誼，故云。到雍正十一年，即撥銀一百八十餘萬兩，開始建築。嗣後逐漸條築，乾隆二十七年第三次南巡，至海寗閱海塘，命歳修老鹽倉一帶柴塘，增坦水石簍，以資擁護，並親臨閱視尖山塔山間之石霸（塔山塘）攺築條石壩工，旋幸觀潮樓閱福建水師。乾隆三十年四次南巡，二月抵杭州，命修築海寗石塘。乾隆四十五年第五次南巡，三月至海寗觀潮，幸尖山，以石塘工有單薄者命一侓攺建魚鱗石塘，其柴塘四千二百餘丈中，有可攺建石塘者，一併勘估辦理。乾隆四十九年六次南巡，幸海寗尖山閱視塘工，工程雖竣尚多未恊之處，又接築至烏龍廟止石塘，撥户部庫銀五百萬兩，連前發各項帑銀，限五年内分段從東而西，陸續修築。胡海塘自發動至完成，歷時六十餘載，費帑銀約一千萬兩；照現在物價人工，約十倍於當時，則在現在建築，要費一萬萬兩銀子，方得完成。</p>

<p>— （冰如）</p>
<p>乾隆六次下江南，而其中四次，除了遊玩之外，可說是都爲了海寗的海塘。有人以爲乾隆時，黄河漫口凡二十次，不聞高宗親臨相度。而獨對於海寗的塘，四次親臨，連撥鉅努帑（其中一次即撥了五百萬兩）；而且到了海寗，寓在陳氏的安瀾圍中，因此更加深了人們的驚奇稱異，爲什麽乾隆皇帝與海寗這樣的密切？作者無從考證起，留待下回分解罷！</p>
<h3 id="c220">有福阿爹 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 寳琛</p>
<p>故鄕（海寗）傳來的旱災消息，似乎不曾使我受到什麽戟刺，因爲幾年來做海上寓公，對於（水），從來不曾發生過恐慌。</p>
<p>這回，爲了一點小事，趁機會還鄕了，一去就住了五天。這五天中間，喝的是（土氣息，泥滋味）的水，聽到的是某鄕某村農民搶米的新聞。午飯後跑到街上，冷清清地像是舊歷的大年初一。找不到站岡的警察；據說，我們鎭上原有五十名警士，三十多名派到鄕下去了丨丨去威嚇，捕捉那些搶米的鄕下人丨丨所以不够岡位的分配。</p>
<p>（黄道湖（注一）裏又搭茶棚賣茶哩！）一個熟識的人在路上對我說。</p>
<p>（哦，黄道湖，賣茶。）這個故事我在十多年前聽我的外祖母講過的。那是清朝咸豐六年的事情，我外祖母是親眼見的。她如果在着，己經一百零一歲了。黄道湖離我的故鄕祇有八九里路，我就想趁這機會去看看。</p>
<p>在我回鄕的第五天的中午，我們居然到了黄道湖。哈，這那裏是（湖）簡實是一個運動塲！塲的中間有一個天然的游泳池，那是黄道湖的遺蹟吧？二十七個橋門的長水堰橋，架在這廣塲上面，露出十足的憨相相她現在只好和嚴子陵的釣臺做配偶了。（注二）</p>
<p>廣塲上果然搭了不少茶棚，我們不在那裏喝茶。在七十九年前，我的外祖母（她那時候是一個二十多歲的大姑娘）也曾在這裏喝過茶的，我這樣想。</p>
<p>（先生，你們認識有福阿爹嗎？他今年九十二歳了。黄道湖裏搭茶棚，祇有他才見過第二回！）冲開水的對我說。</p>
<p>（没有見過。）我說：（有方法找他來談談嗎？）</p>
<p>（他正在隔壁的茶棚裏喝茶哩！不過他耳朶聾了，實在無啥談頭。）</p>
<p>（不管他，你請他來就是了。）</p>
<p>有福阿爹仗着他輕健的腰脚，居然一個人跑到我們的茶棚裏來了。我很恭敬地招呼他，請他坐，他祇是徴笑。我們正在吃鷄蛋，我就剥了一個蛋，送到他手裏。他搖着雙手，打起了海鹽腔說：（罪過！罪過！我們鄕下鷄蛋，應該請城裏人吃的。）他一面說，一面裝起旱烟，似乎表示决不接受的樣子，我祇好把鷄蛋收回，倒了一杯茶請他。</p>
<p>大家都没有話。許多人立在旁邊看。</p>
<p>（咸豐六年。）有福阿爹開口了：（那時候我祇有十四歲。不，年紀雖輕，郤記得清清楚楚的這裏也照樣開着茶店。······那長水堰橋還没有造哩。······想不到今年又看見第二回。）</p>
<p>（那時候鄕下人也出來搶米嗎？）我大聲地問他。</p>
<p>没有回答。他没有聽見。</p>
<p>（今年皇帝也應該免漕了。······鄕下人苦得很！）他自言自語地說。</p>
<p>（嘻！皇帝！有福阿爹老是這樣說。）一個年靑的農人立在旁邊笑着說。</p>
<p>（要是有皇帝，像這樣的大旱年歲，總得替我們鄕下人想點法子。有福阿爹不是說（咸豐六年年歳雖荒，鄕下人倒不像現在那麽苦）麽？）一個紅眼睛老太婆插嘴說。</p>
<p>有福阿爹見旁人多，立起來便走。他向我們打個招呼，似乎說（這裏的人太多了。）我的同伴跟着他去，一直走到長水堰橋的底下，替他照了一張相。那同伴回來很高興地說，（這張照有歷史價值的！）</p>
<p>有福阿爹去了，社邊人還在議論。有的說，（有福阿爹眞有福，他的孫子也己經幾十歳了。）有的說，（那裏算有福氣！他眞有福氣，便該早死了。他家裏的景况不是一年不如一年嗎？早幾時他還自己在這裏拿着網打魚哩，這樣的年紀！）</p>
<p>聽那些閒言雜語，没有意見，我便動議回去。</p>
<p>明天，我又到了上海。除了有福阿爹的照相，没有帶得什麽回來。</p>
<p>（注一）黄道湖本名鸕蔦湖，在浙江海鹽縣西南，和海寗縣交界。湖面很廣。上有長水堰橋，長一百八十步。</p>
<p>（注二）富春山的嚴子陸釣臺遺址，高高的在山上，底下没有水，正和我們所見的長水堰橋相似。</p>

<h3 id="c238">基督非出自猶太 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>十九日電訊，傳德國國社黨天主敎（加特立穆勒在漢諾佛發言，認爲在國社主義下，僅能有一個國家，一個民族，一個敎會，新敎（耶穌敎）與天主敎必須混成一個國家敎會，苟有反抗，必與以放逐之罪。尤其使人極饒興趣者，他們爲要不與其反猶太主義相矛盾，就解說（基督非出自猶太），且爲對猶太宣戰之第一人。</p>
<p>在這兒的們自然不願來替只有耶穌父母才知道的問題算賬，而值得我們予以考察的，是德國這樣把耶穌弄得（來歷不明），究具有若何意義。在歐洲的歷史上，曾經爲同敎異敎這問題引起過不和的國際戰爭，爲要不至因宗敎關係影響到内部的團結，尤其是在因奥國問題使意德關係緊張之時，羅馬敎皇曾反對過希特勒宗敎政策之後，是德國宣佈新舊敎合併原因之一。復次，萬字旗在德國飄揚了一年多之後，希特勒最能動人的廢除凡爾賽條約，解救鄉濟危機兩口號都有（夜長夢多）之歎，爲要轉移人民不滿的目標，曾玩過不少的新花樣，敎會合併也是這些方法之一，此其二。再如說耶穌非猶太人所出，那顯然同鄭孝胥藉王道以掩飾自己的叛國行爲，硬拉孔子與逼迫耶穌另找爹媽，各爲各的政治武器罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c239">獄中樂 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 老吹</p>
<p>友人某君的僕人，因盜案嫌疑，被捕入獄，然而非其罪也。後承正盜的情，並不誣攀，證明並非同黨，亦不與問其事，拘獄三星期而始釋。</p>
<p>據該僕言，獄中雖不是娘舅有，其中並非完全苦境，也有相當快樂的時間，眞是監獄中自有樂地，不必名敎也。</p>
<p>獄中，除鴉烟絶對不能設法私吃外，香烟尚有法可想，不過其價甚昻，因係違禁品也。大約每十枝美麗牌香烟，必須四毛小洋。而香烟一物又爲難友最歡迎的一種東西。難友中苟有買此者，十枝香烟中，主人至多吸到二三枝，其餘早爲難兄難弟朋分以去。</p>
<p>而討索香烟，亦有幾付不同的面孔，有的拿出爺叔面孔來討的，有的用哀未及半，己爲難友從傍接去，　在他自己口内的。這種情形，大約看難友的資格和品性而施其手段。</p>
<p>身畔不能被難友年到有錢，假定發覺，一定要被難友們竹槓敲去，請他們吃東西。因獄中烟酒等物，雖然禁止，而普通食物，隨便可呌人去買，並不在禁止之例。有時敲有錢的人，呌他請肉吃，這也是一椿很普通的事情，（因魚肉等物並不比獄外爲貴）廚司也深知彀中情形，故把肉切作很小的塊粒，但烹好以後，送至監獄門口，而一般難兄難弟，伺候於獄門者，己像新開南貨店的顧客，早擁擠於鐵栅門外一樣，一見大肉進來，用筷的用筷，用手的用手，一齊同大肉進攻，頃刻立盡。在主人至多喝着一些渴，或一些附屬品而己。此種情形，極爲好看。</p>
<p>還有，瞧見了你有錢，就有人來拍你的馬山。假定你挨着洗碗，或倒痰盂，倒馬桶，他們便會前來替你工作，假定知道你家中有錢，難友們必定說，銅錢要他何用，現在是你最後一次的用錢時期了，爲什麽不寫信到家去要呢？假定你寫不來信，我們可以替你寫，可以爲你盡些義務。</p>
<p>難伖們還有一個快樂時期，便是挨着倒痰盂倒馬桶的時侯了。獄囚平日不能越獄門雷池一步，此時可以借公出外，久處獄中，胸内沈悶，此利不覺天高氣爽，胸襟爲之擴然，眞如從前私塾中的小學生，假吃茶，假拉尿的景象一樣。至於平堂監犯，每天也有幾分鐘散步時間，但是一般的運動，比不上倒馬桶倒痰盂的快，這多是監獄中的樂境，</p>
<p>有時也看到在極嚴重的情形之下，把某犯提去詢問，稍頃隠隠聞槍聲數響，此時不免有些肉跳心驚，相顧失色。獄中有重要案犯，難友們往往以不入耳之言，來相勸勉。大抵說，你做的案子，也没有什麽了不得，就是有三長兩短。人生總有一死，你也可說死的有個名目，你可放心，不必去怕，不必去想。</p>
<p>筆者按，這眞是監獄中自有樂地，但他們的樂，是苦中作欒，是無聊的快樂，平日在外無法無天，不知自愛，一旦身入囹圄，方知獄吏之貴，亦己晚矣。其中雖有樂地，還是不去請敎的好。</p>
<h3 id="c240">看打架 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 金人</p>
<p>望着窗外的雨絲，心頭就是一陣悶氣，對面是後弄的亭子間，同樣己把窗子關了起來，想自得其樂的作爲（雨景）看，覺得這背景也似乎太單純了；此外乃冩卽景詩之類，更是談不到了。</p>
<p>但是有凑趣的人來點綴這寂寞的雨景了，並且不抵一個，像持地到這弄裏來給我消遣似的，是一雙我們時常可以在馬路瞧見的典型人物。從上面望下去，是紡綢衣袖捋得那末高高的，雖都戴着軟　的草帽，但直　的面部仍可見個</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>大概，换一句話說，就是那頂草帽比平常戴帽的式樣成了個銳角。我起初發現這一雙凑趣的朋友，是聽見了兩聲（什麽娘）之類的上海話，據說水是傳聲的，所以雖關了窗子，聽來也十分響亮有勁。在這末單純的塲合，發見了兩個（娘）的兒子，我不得不開窗來瞧個究竟了。說來眞是稀奇，我的頭剛探出窗外，對弄人家後門口己圍上許多人，自然這兩位（娘）的兒子困在核心。如其應用到電影藝術上，就是所謂俯瞰鏡頭了；然而我覺得很是遺憾，就是瞧不清他（她）們的腿部，所以我雖有技巧的攝影修養，也想不起攝一張照來留個紀念了。</p>
<p>這裏應該聲明一句，天空繼續飄着行毛雨，但是那兩位凑趣朋友却愈高興起來，在人圍中蹦着脚，划着手，他們的（娘），（妹子），（祖宗），甚至（祖宗）都從他們的嘴裏參加這戰團，嗓子也是愈噪愈高，大有天生我，何生你之槪。但是别說我在雲堆裏看相打，我想於其空划手勢，爲什麽不就是兜心一拳呢？要是對方立足不穏而倒下地去，那些觀衆（或者我亦在内）將拍手歡呼：（英雄萬歲）！但是這樣維持了至少有十分鐘之久，我的書桌上己滿是雨珠，自然凑趣朋友和那些觀衆身上的成績是大有可觀了，打架還尚未成功，心急的觀衆就斜刺裏（打！打！）的喊了出來。這一聲助威，我的精神斗的一振，要是這兩位朋友之中的一個在我面前，哼，就是這未一拳送他回去家，不過這一振馬上恢復了常態，當事人的手還在空中亂划一陣，一切（娘），（祖宗），終總進一步互相喊（請了式）的（老子打你！）我不知自己爲什麽這般熱心，一聽見（打），（又挺起了胸脯，（或者就爲了看打架的緣故）以爲這一下子定是四拳互揮，兩頭相撞，殺一個難解難分，拚一個你死我活。那一羣冒雨的觀衆，把周圍困得更小了，這樣可以瞧得清楚一點，我雖然獨據一窗，也不怕雨打而探出了頭，自己兩手好像滿是勁道，正在千鈞一髮之際，有一位老年紀的人，排衆而入，死拉活扯，把這（打）的局面想勸開；然而不勸猶可，一勸之下，兩個人的拳頭像雨點似的揮動起來，那位老年紀的就做了兩個的盾牌，也可以說箭靶，嚇得他忙竄出重圍。說也奇怪，那兩位朋友立卽停下手來，一路在一個缺口裏向外走，一路說：（哼，看老了的厲害！）直到他們完全離了我的視綫之外，有一位觀衆仰起頭來招呼我，我問他們做着什麽，他以爲我没有瞧見這一段把戲，正經地回答（打架啊！）</p>
<h3 id="c241">阿秀 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>秋風剛一吹起來，阿秀便病了。</p>
<p>草蓑搭成的屋子，日子一久，便東一個洞西一個洞的破敗着，朝上瞧都瞧見靑色的天空。而秋日的雨特别多，接連下了幾天，雨水打漏洞的空兒流下來，四處流着，地上的每個窟窪全成了水窪，水不停的滴着滴着。叮叮咚咚地，從早上到晚上。</p>
<p>夏日晒太陽，秋日淋雨水，一家三口了丨阿有和她的男人和一個不滿十歲物孩了。就住在這破屋子裏，挨過長長的日子。</p>
<p>男人在兩個月前失業。這以後怎麽着也找不做活的地方。</p>
<p>而秋天又來了。冷冷的晨風使人們預感到冰凍的寒天也跟隨在後邊。窮人家就都蹙着眉。冬天的衣服統關在當店裏，生計没着落。怎麽辦呢。憂愁着冬天的日子快降臨，憂愁着一家三口子的伙食。</p>
<p>憂愁的份量超過了一個孱弱的身子所能背負的能力以上，於是阿秀病了。所以這不是平常的病，而是因了太多的鬱悸和太多的憂愁，沉在無邊鬱悸和憂愁的邊裏，牠支持不住，精神是一天天愈見衰老下來了。</p>
<p>病是隨着憂鬱感的加重而加重，成天躺在牀上，歇斯迭里地呻吟着。阿秀幾乎連撑自己的身體走動的氣力都消失了。</p>
<p>呻吟的氣息件着雨滴的聲響凄凉的交奏着。</p>
<p>（孩子繞着牀沿，頻頻拖着阿秀的手腕，吵着肚子餓，要吃）。</p>
<p>（等等吧！爸爸回來準會帶些東西給你的）。</p>
<p>（你去門上等着，爸爸馬上就回來的）。</p>
<p>娘張着毫無神采的眼睛，像一條死魚珠。痛楚地證住孩子的臉。伸出一支枯瘦得柴把似的手，撫摸着孩子的頭。低低的嗓子，上氣接不着下氣的哄過孩子。孩子聽了娘的話，也便巴巴的冲出門外去等爸爸。</p>
<p>兩串晶瑩的涙珠却悄悄的爬落到阿秀的蒼黄的腮頰上，蝸牛似的。</p>
<p>爸爸在午後跟着鄰居阿秀的女友袁二嫂上廠裏去討欠薪了。還託袁二嫂向廠裏再續假。</p>
<p>如果半個月的欠錢全給她。一家三口子便可以比較舒服一點過半個月的日子。此外阿秀唯一的希望，就是自己的身體快些恢復過灰。使得快些上工去。</p>
<p>因爲她若是不能去做工，三口子就都要挨餓的。</p>
<p>阿秀想這想那累得，有點要睡的樣子，在迷濛的感覺中，她猛的瞥見袁二嫂給人家攆倒在門外的牆邊。掙扎了半天爬不上來，接着擁出幾個大漢子，她的男人正被兩個人擒住領結，拖拖追追的，不知把他推到什麽地方去。</p>
<p>一陣驚動，阿秀醒了，擦擦眼睛。身子還躺在硬硬的森牀上，適纔原來是一回惡夢。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c242">秋天的感想 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>雨，在秋的清晨裏，一絲絲的飄着，樣子像是四月的黄霉，但氣候却没有黄霉時候那麽的濕悶，雖然没有風括着，然而也己經清凉得多了。窗外牆上的牽牛花開得正盛，似乎今天的藤枝比昨天攀高了不少；花朶，在昨天還只有三二朶，而今天也己添增了不少，在碧錄的葉子中，襯着一朶朶紅色的，紫色的，藍色的花朶，看上去着實有點温柔的可愛。天空高高的掛在禮拜堂的項尖上，找不出有一片浮雲在飛着，有時，有一枝或幾枝陽光劃破了一色的天空，濾過了細雨，照到禮拜堂的頂上，但己引不起有多大的温暖，反而感覺到有些異樣的慘淡。四周除了秋蟲的悲鳴外，差不多一切都在静穆中。</p>
<p>由暑天中所留下來的熱情，這時己完全消逝無餘；雖然秋天的陰沉使人有些不暢之感，但己比那斷腸的春天，騷動的夏天爽快得多了。</p>
<p>但，事實上也有點使悲壯的秋晨减色的，那就是擾亂秋晨清静的槍砲聲，這軋軋軋軋和啪啪啪的聲音，實在使人感到些恐怖。聽着街上皮鞋急跑的聲息，就知道他們在操練巷戰。</p>
<p>於是我就想起啦，那一個蕭拍納曾經說過的一句話，卽；“ＭytheＷayofuokihgistotellthetruthlfworld"我之笑話者，世界之眞理。（作者譯）現在我一遍二遍三遍甚至十遍二十遍的回嚼首這一句俏皮話，但我仍不能得到些什麽，甚至想在蕭老頭兒的雪折鬍子上，一雙含有精神和頑皮的眼睛裏去求解答，但究竟我仍是迷惑着，不知這一句話的眞意。</p>
<p>幾個年頭前的一個秋天起到現在，銳利的砲火一直的没有停過，那恐懼的聲音像還隐約的在我們耳邊際，對於這一個突來刺激我們似乎記得很清楚，並没有一個眞理在譏笑中求出。</p>
<p>又據另一批人說，眞理是祇有在砲火的威力聲下才能求得，那麽肅老頭兒的一句話又免得怎樣的解釋呢？我搔着頭，用了全力去求這一解答，但結果仍是一個惘悵而己。然而眞理必須有的，世界上有着這麽許多幾萬萬的人們在渴望着，他們似乎並不需要在譏笑中去求得眞理，假使是這樣的話，他們會在没有求得眞理前，己經爲了譏笑而餓穿了肚皮。</p>
<p>這時，禮拜堂裏的鐘聲宏亮的響着，而槍聲己稀落了下去；秋雨仍是絲絲在空中飄着。</p>
<h3 id="c243">煙 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 小林</p>
<p>像獨孤者把司的克看作威唯一的伴侣一樣。帶着它，上街去溜躂，猶如帶着愛人那麽親暱地。烟捲，如今也居然成爲我日常生活一件不可片刻離輟的必需品了。</p>
<p>起初，不會吸烟，也就根本不想吸。不想吸到罷了，尚且輕蔑抽烟的人們哩。那有啥味道，終以爲不是近逐時髦的低劣表現，便是一種無謂的浪費。你想，啣在口裏，又苦又澀，爲什麽不把這些，錢用來買米古力糖之類。嚼嚼，至少會有烟所没有的甜味的。可是誰都嗜好它，到處如此，便連小姐們，小把戲都因呀烟的抽個像煞有介事。口上咬一根烟，烟土披里純地，怪有神氣的，烟的迷的之力眞是不小。我總瞧不慣，看見抽烟的人，就作惡，不止作惡，也够討厭，老是避開，幾乎想將它從抽的人的嘴裏搶下來，可是抽着烟的却是津津有味，有些時候我眞並無原因而氣了半天。</p>
<p>往前痛恨烟和抽烟的人有像這般的程度。而如今，竟然變成了烟鬼，癖癮之深恐怕都在一般人之上，自己也不知怎的。從早到晚，烟不離嘴，坐也是，站也是有時幾幾乎是飯可以不吃而烟則不能不抽的情形。簡直是第二生命了。</p>
<p>抽上以後，才深深地，滋噹到烟確是有許多非筆墨所有形容的功効和微妙的覺感。差不多比糧食更需要的糧食了。</p>
<p>烟所能給予，我的靈感上幻覺與沉醉是說不完的。</p>
<p>當静肅無一些聲息的深夜，在静肅而又明亮的燈光下，一個人抽着烟，一根又一根，一口一口的抽着，綏綏抽吹嘘出來，看以嘴裏吹嘘出來的一重重的烟霧，一個個的烟圈子，白濛濛的，曲綫的，蜿蜒的飄上去，幻成各種美麗的姿態。等等漸散了。過一下又再來一回。半閉着眼珠，把自己的身心放在忘我的境界裏，色白的萝裏，夢遊似地，每一層烟霧都載着淡淡的輕鬆的冥想，而且戴着更从的使心靈舒適的憧憬，淡地，要摸捉也不可摸捉。</p>
<p>也不感到寂寞了。烟一抽上，便好像在無形中有一個看不見的形影院伴在心身，靈魂己悠悠然與之混成一片了。</p>
<p>無聊的時候也往往因了烟而忘却無聊。抓着筆桿，楞了半天，不名一個字的時候，抽根烟，文思或者說是靈感就自然地浮上來。烟遂成爲我精神的蘇息，精神的戀者了。</p>
<p>道理是說不出的。卽是說得出也仍是不說的好。留一點心靈上奥妙的感覺够有味兒的，一說，可就不靈了。不過若是懂得烟霧何以終歸要嬝嬝地從嘴裏引出，從房子裏飛到窗外去；微波因風吹爲什麽要起漣漪；是是爲什麽要閃眼，人爲什麽要那樣中意烟捲·都是一樣。懂得這些，可以了然於吸烟者的秘密了。</p>
<p>其實也没有什麽秘密。祇需要會心的微笑和領略就够了。</p>

<h3 id="c244">文憑與失業 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>本欄近來接到許多靑年學生的來信，他們對於現行敎育行政及畢業文憑等問題，發生資格上的困難，要求編者替他們解决。這是在改革敎育和行政的過渡時代裏必有的現象，實有加以討論的必要。現在先將所詢問題分析一下。</p>
<p>（一）因爲没有畢業文憑找不到職業</p>
<p>（二）没有畢業文憑雖有同樣程度和經　　　濟能力，也不能到立案的中等以上的學校去讀書。</p>
<p>（三）立案的大中學校，拒絶未經會考的學應考</p>
<p>（四）未立案的敎會學校學生，不能到立案的學校去讀書。</p>
<p>現在先談第一個問題。</p>
<p>子的人替你介紹以外，　　一件事，　在很難，極多的有高等資　及學力的人，也是遇着失業的困難。像這種限定資格的現態，可以表現出失業恐慌的嚴重性及一般人想付低價而僱用有較高能力的人的民理。所以這個實在並不是什麽文憑不文憑的問題，而是如何來解决失業恐慌，使求過於代的問題。</p>
<p>我們覺得這些没有畢業文憑的人，也不必　於憂慮，因爲現在一切機關和商店等處僱用人員雖然根定最低的資格，但他們絶不會只要資格和文憑，而不需要有眞才實學的人替他們辦事啊！所以只要你有能力，你能用心，努力，你總可以找到你所需要所能勝任的職業。</p>
<p>至於積極補救的辦法，只有到學校去追求文憑，假使資格及經濟也發生問題，那末可以到補習學校去。這種學校的證書也許可以帮助一二。</p>
<p>關於第二三四三個問題的性質是差不多的，它是關連到整個敎育及行政問題，談起來，話很長，爲了篇幅所限，只能談談在這整頓敎育行政的過渡時期中一般資格不符的學生所應取的態度。</p>
<p>現在有許多學生因爲資格所限，不能到學校裏去讀書，每每就發生一種煩悶和悲哀的心理。這實在是錯誤的。要知道到學校去讀那的目的，是想得到學識，並不是去要文憑。那未何處不是求學的地方？你的週圍實在都是什昨你去探討的學識。你何必一定要在這狹隘的學校裏求學？更何必因爲不能到學校去讀書就感覺煩悶？</p>
<p>所以現在一般未立案學校的學生及其他資格不符的學生，在這個困難的情形下，除了竭力設法轉入立案的學校裏去以外，不得己的時候，只好到没有立案的學校或補習學校去。周樣是讀書，只要自己努力上進，絶不會和立案的學生有什麽兩樣。因爲求學完全是本身的問題，學校再好些，假使自己没有實在的能力，那末，雖有文憑，效用亦屬有限的呀！</p>
<p>最後，編者希望敎育當局籌想根本辦法，來補救這些求學無門的靑年，譬如重新舉行私校學生甄别考試，嚴行調查各未立案學校的内容，迫其立案，及另設學校専門收容這些資格不符的學生等等。</p>

<p>恒豐的生意很好，這是極爲明白的事實。雖然每天能做多少錢生意，除了老　毛老大之外，誰也不十分明白，可以一天能够賣掉兩斗黄豆的頭腐，却也很可觀了。加之毛老大夫婦做生意又都很和氣，而况這一百多家的村莊裏，就祇有這麽一家店，所以毛老大每一次看見貼在店門口大先生給他寫的春聯；（大地春回，四時恒茂），（田家普樂，五谷豐登），再加上那（生意興隆）的横額，他的肥胖胖的臉上，總不免要笑迷迷的。至於說到大先生，那未祇在這十六個字的聯文中便可看出他是一個了不起的秀才，那中間嵌了（大田）（恒豐）四個字。村名和店名都在其内，該是多麽不容易啊。毛老大雖說不是讀書人，可是自己到底認識一些字，對於這此地方，經過别人的一番解釋，他竟是很明白了</p>
<p>今晚灰鷄母照例又在靠着櫃臺喝燒酒，不過這一次却不是茴香蠶豆下酒，而是十個錢的花生了。在他身旁，有四個人在打紙牌，其中除了老闆娘一個女人以外，其餘的一個是六公公，一個是裁縫細狗，還有一個寄居在本村的剃頭匠長炎。此外還有道士（註）金榮和閹鷄的三爛頭都在看牌。毛老闆卻伏在櫃臺上吸水烟。擺在他手旁的洋油燈，不管那玻璃燈罩給烟子薰黑，可是那比菜油燈到底要亮得多了。那種光照在他臉上顯得一種灰白色。</p>
<p>店裏的空氣中充溢人們和平的呼吸。很顯然的所謂光復或者是革命黨等等國家大事，在他們之間並没有發生重大的變化。雖說村裏己有了兩個剃了頭髮的和尚頭，當他們下午開始知道這一消的時候，大家未嘗不興高彩烈的談論了一番，可是一到晚上，因爲一大半的人都在注意那二十錢一鬥的紙牌，一鬥牌八十個錢的輸嬴，在他們確也是一個很大的數目；所以（一個洋鬼子）（兩個各尚頭）之類的話，現在不大聽見了。</p>
<p>不過灰鷄母卻是生平不打紙牌，自然，了們六七個人的鬥牌，一點也不能引起他的興趣，他仍然静静的喝着酒，慢慢的剥着落花生。他偶然也伸頭從老關娘的肩頭去看她打牌，蠟燭的光焰，一閃一跳的，想看清幾張牌覺得眼睛也很費力，所以他以爲這一萬三餅六索之類的玩意兒，到底没有意思。而同時就因着打牌而點了兩根紅燭，算起來到是一百多錢，也是太不合算了。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Due to excessive military expenditure in Guangdong Province, the funds of the Southwest Political Council were reduced from 6 million yuan to 2 million yuan.

<h3 id="e28">Saving Grain to Prevent Famine Respectfully <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, mindful of past events where natural disasters were prevalent and human defense insufficient, specially borrowed one million yuan from Shanghai banking circles through the Department of Finance. It also designated seven counties, including Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Taixian, Dongtai, and Huatexing, to purchase rice grains and store them in warehouses in each county, in preparation for famine. The government would then sell the rice at a fair price to relieve the people's food needs. At the same time, ordinary farmers, if facing temporary emergencies, could also use rice grains to mortgage and borrow money from the county warehouses, with an interest rate of one percent. Some believe that starting to store grain at a time when disaster has already occurred seems a bit too late. However, we Chinese have an old saying: "It's never too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost." Therefore, after losing sheep, being able to repair the sheepfold very firmly, preventing the loss of sheep forever, is indeed a great future blessing, which is what the people earnestly hope for now. Moreover, our country's rural economy is progressing slowly, and the turnover is slow along with the harvest season. Therefore, as long as it can be handled effectively, the relatively abundant counties can have a regulating effect, and there will be some indirect help to the severely drought-stricken areas.</p>
<p>We also feel that there are shortcomings. First, the scope is too narrow. Only seven out of sixty counties have this facility. If a disaster occurs, the resistance seems still weak. In terms of population ratio, the above-mentioned seven counties account for only one-eighth of the total population of Jiangsu. Therefore, we believe that this method should be expanded as much as possible. Not only should the entire Jiangsu province have such facilities, but the entire country of China needs to have the same preparations. Second, the funds prepared are too small. The deep-rooted problem of our country's rural economy is slow turnover. Too little funds may not help, and it is easy for local unscrupulous elements to control. If our country's financial circles are very tight, then it is another matter. If there is too much idle capital and there is difficulty in releasing it, if the government can operate properly, the cash accumulated in the cities can be reactivated and flow back to the countryside, indirectly enough to stabilize the generally declining market.</p>
<p>Our China, until now, although nominally an agricultural country, still lacks economic construction in rural areas. Therefore, a good harvest can lead to low grain prices harming farmers, and a poor harvest can lead to deaths on the roads. In the future, in terms of negative construction, at least a national rice policy must be established, so that a good harvest does not become a disaster and a poor harvest does not lead to displacement. National, provincial, and county warehouses should be quickly prepared and established to publicly regulate the people's food. Japan is not a completely agricultural country, but its stored rice is more than 13 million stones. Although it has other uses – war preparation – it also has some effect on regulating rice grains. Moreover, in the current era, the smell of gunpowder is everywhere in Europe and Asia. It is difficult to guarantee when a war will break out. A agricultural country like ours, if its industry cannot compete with others, at least its food production must be self-sufficient, so that even when overseas transportation is cut off, we are not afraid of lacking the source of life. However, to do such preparatory work, great efforts are needed. Setting up warehouses everywhere and helping agricultural production is a very effective strategy.</p>
<p>Our country must focus on the main food of the people – rice – to cope with the current extraordinary period, and there is a need for further management methods. On the side of the producing farmers, they must be able to work with peace of mind, not working hard all year round and not getting enough to eat. Therefore, the cost of rice production must be calculated in a relatively detailed manner. Based on this calculation, a rice price adjustment should be set. If the market price falls below the lowest price, the national, provincial, or county warehouses will come out and buy rice in large quantities, so that farmers will not suffer losses, and the rural economy will be adjusted to some extent. On the side of consumers, especially industrial and commercial operators gathered in cities, if rice prices are too high, it will affect the entire social relationship. Therefore, the income of the general public – the income of various industries other than agriculture – must be investigated in detail. Using this survey number as a basis, we calculate the allocation of living expenses to determine the highest rice price, so that consumers are not threatened by excessively high food prices. If so, although it may not be possible to immediately regulate the imbalanced state of cities and villages, it can reduce the suffering of both parties and train the general public to be prepared for extraordinary times.</p>

At the meeting, a marble Buddha statue was enshrined, and the Buddha's name was chanted three times when the name was called. Dharma Master Daokong, wearing a ochre robe, stood still and listened quietly to the reports of the representatives of various countries. After that, he continued to speak, his tone was enthusiastic and sometimes quite agitated. The main idea was (the religion of faith) is dead, and (the religion of knowledge) is on the rise. Today, people are willing to have knowledge and unwilling to have faith, etc. The conclusion is roughly like this. What is especially noteworthy at the conference is that the German National Socialist Party representative Osterdell said, (Young Germans are prepared to accept Buddhism, because Christianity has never been able to completely conquer the German soul. The doctrines advocated by Christ, advocating cheapness and suppression, are actually contrary to the German nature). (24th Havas Electric Report)</p>

<p>(Geneva) After the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, the League of Nations has been actively trying to persuade the United States to join. Today, the President of the League of Nations, Mr. Sandler, specially used wireless radio to broadcast a speech to the entire American people. The speech was transmitted from Geneva to the United States and then broadcast to all parts of the United States. Mr. Sang's speech was very tactful and moving.

<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Barthou is going to Geneva again. His three important tasks are the plan to protect Austria's independence, the stalled Eastern European Locarno Treaty, and the Saarland plebiscite issue. The Paris newspapers also use these three things as their arguments. Le Petit Parisien stated that no progress can be made on the Saarland issue at this session of the League of Nations. As for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, the newspaper stated that although Germany opposes it and Poland is indifferent, the plan has not been abandoned. Some key issues have been resolved, but the time for public discussion is not yet ripe. Le Journal de Paris stated that Martou's trip to Geneva is related to the Security Plan. This plan takes the international guarantee of Austria's independence and the adjustment of economic relations as its two pillars. These two points are actually related. The solution depends entirely on the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia, and these two countries are now going in opposite directions. Maldu will be the peacemaker between these two enemy countries. (24th Kuomin Electric Report)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The current work situation of the League of Nations is roughly as follows: Two committees have now completed their work, namely the First Committee (studying legal and organizational issues) and the Second Committee. All economic, financial, and technical issues are studied by the Second Committee. For example, the method of promoting offsetting proposed by the French Minister of Commerce Laimur is reviewed by the committee. As for the Fourth Committee, which studies budget issues, it did not encounter much difficulty and can be completed on Tuesday. The same is true for the Fifth Committee, which studies humanitarian and social issues. As for the Third Committee on disarmament issues, it was not organized this year. Since there is a Disarmament Conference, there will be this committee again.</p>

<p>Only the Sixth Committee (political issues) is more difficult to deal with the dispute in the Grand Chaco of South America. The governments are eager for a quick conclusion, but procedural issues are sufficient to give the countries concerned an opportunity to delay. Roughly speaking, this matter will follow the precedent of the 1932 Sino-Japanese dispute and convene an extraordinary general assembly to handle it. The period should be in November. After briefly describing the work of the League of Nations, it can be seen that the 15th session of the League of Nations General Assembly can be adjourned within the next week, because the issues raised in the various committees that are not important, the various delegations do not want to discuss in the plenary session of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>This decision has its reasons. The most difficult problem at the moment is in the Executive Council or is being negotiated mutually by various countries diplomatically, not within the scope of the General Assembly. This is the reason for convening the Executive Council on Tuesday. However, the Executive Council on Tuesday is not the last time. According to routine practice, after the General Assembly closes, the Executive Council must meet once again to approve the various measures decided by the General Assembly and allocate them to the various organs of the League of Nations for implementation.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, only the Saar issue will be discussed at the Executive Council meeting on Tuesday, or at least in a closed meeting. After the Saarland Plebiscite Committee revealed the various actions of the Germans in the Saarland, the Executive Council wanted to awaken the Germans in some way and make them respect their promises on the Saarland issue. Therefore, the Executive Council is bound to hold a special meeting in November to inspect the progress of the Saarland issue and, based on the report of the Saarland Tripartite Committee (headed by the Italian representative Aletyashi), study the recent memorandum submitted by France on the Saarland. At this time, French Foreign Minister Barthou will again negotiate with the UK, Italy, and Russia. The importance of extra-conference contact is above the work of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>French Foreign Minister Barthou, with the full consent of the French Cabinet, will re-discuss the organization of the Danube River basin and the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, both of which were talked about and then suspended. Austrian Foreign Minister Weideger also returned to Geneva, which shows that the concern of various countries for Austria's fate and its relations with various countries is still continuing. As for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, those who support it will redouble their efforts to seek mutual understanding and will not be discouraged by Germany's rejection. France is working hard to find a way to ensure that most sincere countries can agree. Poland is about to reply to Barthou sooner or later. The reply will first be sent to the French Foreign Minister. The reply can also provide new factors. According to the responsible Polish side, Poland's reply is mostly critical. The reason has been explained by Polish Foreign Minister Beck and his colleagues and is already known to the outside world. However, Poland's criticism has long been anticipated by the future counterparts of the Eastern Mutual Assistance Pact. Therefore, the French government is shouldering a task of creating European peace) and will work harder in the coming week. (23rd Havas Electric Report)</p>

<p>Upholding the Democratic System</p>
<p>Welcoming the Soviet Union into the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Paris) Czech Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, Belles, gave a speech to Le Petit Parisien, which the newspaper will publish tomorrow. Belles briefly stated that he believes that various systems of the country should be premised on freedom, and the parliament should still be the expression of the will of the people. As long as the political system is beneficial to democracy, it does not matter what form it takes. Belles also said that the national system should adapt to the crisis felt by democracy in the times. Looking around the political leaders of various countries, in terms of politics and morality, can most people bear responsibility without shame? Belles mentioned diplomatic issues, saying that for ten years, he has always advocated that the Soviet Union should return to the European political stage. Because the Czech Republic is located in Central Europe, it feels the most direct impact of the Soviet Union being outside the League of Nations. Therefore, the desire for the Soviet Union to join the League is very sincere. In conclusion, he said that he knows that the cause of European peace and revitalization is not easy, but he believes that there is a way to facilitate and guide it and make it produce great benefits.

<p>Alliance with Italy or Pro-German?</p>
<p>(Paris) *The Times* published an article entitled "Hungary and Central Europe," discussing Hungary's relationship with its neighbors. It concluded that "When Hungary and Italy formed an agreement (referring to the protocol agreed upon on March 17 of this year), Italy and Germany were still close. At that time, Italy's foreign policy favored revising the peace treaty. However, after the coup in Austria on July 25, relations between Italy and Germany became strained, leading to the complete failure of Italy's policy of supporting treaty revision and aligning with Germany. From now on, will Hungary cooperate with Italy or negotiate with Germany? It must choose one. If it allies with Italy, the benefits will be great, as the close relationship between Hungary and Italy has already brought Hungary immense political and economic benefits. Otherwise, Hungary will not be able to maintain a significant position in Central Europe. If it allies with Germany, Hungary will become a vassal state under Germany's hegemony in the Danube region. Hungary must know where to go." *The Times* concluded that, for the sake of Hungary's interests, it should strive for cooperation to build Central Europe. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>France Explains its Position</p>
<p>Willing to Cooperate Economically with All Countries</p>
<p>But Not Intending to Take the Lead</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives of countries belonging to the Gold Standard Bloc will hold a meeting this afternoon at the League of Nations headquarters, chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister Jaspar. In addition to Belgium, countries that have consistently supported the gold standard, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and Italy, will participate in this conference. France will be represented by Minister of Commerce Lamoureux. Lamoureux recently gave a speech at the Swiss French Chamber of Commerce, outlining France's position on the Gold Standard Bloc. Lamoureux stated that France would not take the lead in economic cooperation with the Gold Standard countries, as most countries joining the Gold Standard Bloc are closely related to agricultural economies. If France were to allow close cooperation with these countries, such as adopting preferential tariffs for them, the interests particularly related to French agriculture would be harmed. However, France does not, in principle, oppose economic cooperation among Gold Standard Bloc countries. France will participate in the Gold Standard Bloc countries' meeting and sincerely hopes it will be fruitful. It is estimated that after the first meeting, the Gold Standard Bloc countries will decide to establish a permanent conference or committee to implement fundamental concepts that seek mutual understanding among countries, while also seeking to avoid harming the major interests of the countries concerned.

<p>Puppet Representative O'hashi Ordered to Travel East</p>
<p>Compromise Price of 170 Million</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway had seemingly stalled after the representative of (Manchukuo) withdrew from Tokyo. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Hirota and the Russian Ambassador to Japan repeatedly negotiated. At the same time, Ambassador Ota in Moscow and Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Sokolnikov continued to negotiate several times, finally seeing a glimmer of hope for a resolution. The Soviet side expressed willingness to compromise, also indicating that the transfer price was close to Hirota's proposal. Foreign Minister Hirota immediately informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of (Manchukuo) of this, deciding to hold the third Soviet-Manchu representative conference in Tokyo. Deputy Minister O'hashi departed for Changchun on the evening of the 22nd. Once he arrives in Tokyo, the negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway will officially resume. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is rumored that after Foreign Minister Hirota facilitated the matter, both sides agreed to compromise on the selling price of the Chinese Eastern Railway, estimating it at 170 million Japanese yen, including 30 million yen for severance pay for Russian railway employees. Originally, Russia asked for 190 million yen, while the (Manchu) side only agreed to 150 million yen, a difference of 40 million yen. Now, both sides have compromised by 20 million yen in the hopes of completing the transaction. It is expected that the Russia-(Manchu) side will resume meetings within a few days, as the (Manchu) representative has already set out for Tokyo at Hirota's invitation. At the meeting, the payment method will be formally discussed. It is said that the general outline is as follows: two-thirds of the total amount will be paid in goods, and the remainder in cash, with half paid immediately and the other half paid off in three years. All Russian railway employees must be dismissed within six months after the signing of the sales contract, and their severance pay will be paid annually over three years. All assets and debts not included in the Chinese Eastern Railway settlement will be collected by Soviet Russia. (Tokyo) It is rumored that regarding the sale price of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the (Manchukuo) side has further recognized the compromised amount of 170 million yen. Given this trend, if the negotiations between O'hashi and Yurenev can proceed quickly, a temporary agreement may be concluded by mid-October. At the same time, the fishery problem and border issues between Japan and the Soviet Union can also be balanced and resolved satisfactorily. Therefore, the general public is paying close attention to how the negotiations between O'hashi and Yurenev will ultimately conclude. (United Press, 24th)</p>

<p>(1) Transfer Price: 140 million yen for the Chinese Eastern Railway and its affiliated businesses, and 30 million yen for severance pay for Soviet Russian employees, totaling 170 million Japanese yen. (2) Upon the establishment of the transfer treaty or agreement, the ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway should be transferred to (Manchu) Kuo. (3) Within one month after the signing of the treaty or agreement, the two governments should appoint a receiving committee to complete the transfer within three months. (4) Regarding the payment of the price, one-third will be in cash and two-thirds in goods. Half of the cash will be paid first, and the remaining half will be paid in installments. (5) All Soviet Russian employees will retire within six months after the establishment of the negotiations, and the severance pay will be paid within three years. (6) The Soviet Russian government shall be fully responsible for all shareholders, bondholders, and other creditors of the North Railway prior to March 9, 1917. (7) The Soviet Russian government shall be responsible for all debts incurred by the North Railway to third parties after that date until the establishment of the negotiations.

<p>(Tokyo) With the selling price of the Chinese Eastern Railway set at 170 million yen, (Manchukuo) needs to pay Russia 77 million yen in cash. Foreign Minister Hirota's purpose in summoning (Manchukuo) representative O'hashi and Director-General of the Treasury Hoshino is to discuss raising this amount of cash. The fundraising method seems to involve the South Manchuria Railway Company operating the Chinese Eastern Railway, with the South Manchuria Railway issuing corporate bonds or (Manchukuo) itself raising national debt in Japan.

<p>(Moscow) A dispatch from Blagoveshchensk states that the Manchurian authorities and Japanese soldiers' transgressions on the Chinese Eastern Railway are increasing day by day. In order to provoke new conflicts and further complicate the situation, the Japanese military authorities are disregarding all agreements and even violating local laws, seizing sections of land along the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to a dispatch from Harbin on the 20th of this month, Chinese Eastern Railway Director Roti has reported this matter to the board of directors, citing such transgressions at Ashihe Station, Guanchengzi Station (transliteration), and Harbin Station. Roti also stated that he had requested attention from the police authorities regarding this matter, but to no avail. (TASS News Agency, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) If the Chinese Eastern Railway transfer negotiations are successful, the foundation for peace between Japan, Russia, and (Manchu) can be established. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota will propose the establishment of a trilateral joint border commission, following the proposal made by former Foreign Minister Uchida in December of Showa 7 (1932) for a Soviet Russian non-aggression treaty. Russia has indicated in principle that it has no objection to this. Therefore, after the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations are completed, Foreign Minister Hirota and Ambassador Yurenev will discuss this issue in early November. In addition to this commission, Foreign Minister Hirota plans to establish a demilitarized zone at a certain distance on both sides of the border line. Therefore, the peace efforts between Japan, Russia, and (Manchu) will be carried out taking advantage of the opportunity of the establishment of the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations. (Dentsu News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the illegal negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway are extremely unlikely to succeed. The reasons are as follows: (1) Foreign Minister Hirota is eager to conclude the negotiations successfully in order to realize the first step of his peaceful diplomacy and attempt to gain the trust of the military. (2) The military believes that the Chinese Eastern Railway is a "rat in a bag" and not worth paying money to buy. Furthermore, given that Russia has not taken active action after the arrest of a large number of Russian railway employees, they believe that the Russian army is not to be feared. (3) However, Russia is actually in a situation where the problem of joining the League of Nations has not been completed, the Eastern Peace Agreement has not yielded results, and the Japanese army has gathered in northern Manchuria, carrying out various provocative actions. At this time, Russia has no choice but to ease the atmosphere with the Japanese army and take advantage of the disagreement between Hirota and the military. The Russian ambassador deliberately expressed concessions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to restrain the military's aggressive theory. (China United Press, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese Eastern Railway, which was once the sole foothold for Russia's Far East policy for the past seventy years, is now being transferred to (Manchukuo) as a result of Foreign Minister Hirota's mediation. This is not only of great historical significance, but also has political implications as the Soviet Union's abandonment of the Chinese Eastern Railway signifies a fundamental change in its Far East policy. The Soviet Union's recent participation in the League of Nations, the signing of the Franco-Russian alliance, and the stabilization of the western atmosphere, while implementing a policy of stabilizing the Far East, has resulted in a sharp turn in the relationship between Japan, (Manchu), and the Soviet Union, which had recently reached the point of extreme deterioration.

The National Socialist salute was used at the beginning and end of the ceremony.

<p>(Berlin) Six thousand German Evangelical pastors, representing one-third of all German Evangelical churches, publicly resisted today during the inauguration ceremony of National Archbishop Müller. Each declared in the church their opposition to Archbishop Müller and his doctrines of national discrimination and political action. When Müller was inaugurated, the generally pro-Müller believers, under military supervision, saluted the swastika flag and swore allegiance to Müller. They believed that Müller's inauguration was the final realization of the unified thought of German Protestants for centuries. However, opponents pointed out that this was only a temporary victory. Pastor Niemöller of Wittenberg is still confined indoors to prevent him from going out to spread opposition propaganda, but Pastor Lieser of Bavaria, a key figure in the opposition party, is still preaching in the Ansbach church, which is crowded with National Socialist party members, and officials have not interfered.

It is said that the promulgation of this decree is due to the frequent riots by Marxists in various places. Local authorities are searching and arresting rioters to investigate the scope of the conspiracy to revolt. It is indeed necessary to declare a state of emergency. However, this move by the government failed to stop the riots and instead angered the rioters, who engaged in revolutionary actions.

<p>(Tokyo) The recent hurricane has ravaged commercial and industrial areas such as Osaka and Kobe, causing enormous damage. It will take a considerable amount of time to restore them to their former state, and the impact on foreign trade is also very significant. Products have not been delivered on schedule, causing commodity prices to rise. In addition, the rice crop this year has decreased by 13% compared to normal years. The government is currently investigating the extent of the damage and, at the same time, is seeking thorough relief measures for the recovery. Recovery materials such as timber, bricks, and tiles have already risen in price by 20% to 30%. Therefore, on the 23rd, the Ministry of the Interior issued an order to all prefectures and counties affected by the disaster to crack down on profiteering and will severely punish unscrupulous merchants without leniency.

<p>A Major Tragedy in Coal Mining History</p>
<p>Rescue Work Cannot Be Carried Out</p>
<p>Mine Shaft Sealed, Remaining Fire Unextinguished</p>
<p>(London) According to a statement released by the authorities today, 260 people have been accounted for as victims of the explosion and fire at the Creswell mine on Saturday. Rescue work is almost impossible, and there is no hope of survival for those buried underground. Therefore, it must now be terminated. This explosion is the most tragic in the history of Welsh coal mining. Comparable incidents include the explosion at the Dawson mine in New Mexico in October 1913, which killed 263 people, and the explosion at the Monongah mine in West Virginia in 1907, which killed 363 people. At the time of the explosion, there were 400 to 500 miners working, and at least 200 were not affected and escaped to the surface. This morning, the fire underground was still unextinguished, and explosions of gas were heard from time to time. The mine entrance has now been sealed. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>Recovery Bureau Reorganization Plan to Be Announced Imminently</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that although labor leaders were directly asked by President Roosevelt yesterday to halt the textile workers' strike, they are still determined to fight to the end. Therefore, the cessation of the strike now may be temporary. Gorman, Vice President of the Textile Workers Union, told the Associated Press this morning that the union would try to bring all American textile workers under its umbrella. Union leaders also stated directly that the current resumption of work is merely a preparatory period for the final showdown between union and non-union workers. According to official union figures, the strike has cost the lives of sixteen workers, with an additional two hundred seriously injured. Workers' wage losses are estimated at US$15 million. The losses suffered by factories are unknown but are likely to be in the tens of millions. Union leaders today also attacked the government's recent excessive military spending, saying that it has severely hampered economic recovery. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(New York) New York’s Minsheng News has learned from authoritative sources that President Roosevelt will soon announce a complete reorganization of the National Recovery Administration, with Barlow, former director of the Military-Industrial Bureau, in charge.

The current NRA director, General Johnson, presidential advisor Professor Moley, and Richtorburg are all expected to join the first committee. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Hauptmann's Thorough Interrogation Reveals Strong Counter-Evidence <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Kidnapping and Murder Suspicion May Not Hold</p>
<p>Lindberghs Fly to New York to Confront Hauptmann</p>
<p>(New York) During a thorough interrogation of Hauptmann, the suspect in the kidnapping and murder of Colonel Lindbergh's son, strong counter-evidence has been discovered. The suspicion against Hauptmann for kidnapping and murder may not be sustainable, and the real culprit may well be Fisch, who has already died in Germany. According to today's investigation, only one point remains questionable: Hauptmann's speculative business capital increased significantly after the ransom was paid. His wife claims that she worked as a hostess at a certain store the year before, and Hauptmann would pick her up from the store every Tuesday and Thursday. The night Lindbergh's son was kidnapped happened to be a Tuesday. Hauptmann also claims that the cash found by the police was given to him by his friend Fisch for safekeeping. Hauptmann said that when Fisch went to Germany, he entrusted three boxes to him for safekeeping. He put them aside and forgot about them for a long time. Later, due to a leaky roof that damaged the boxes, he suddenly discovered that they contained gold certificates worth $13,750. This statement has been confirmed by his landlady, who said that Hauptmann did often complain about roof leaks that damaged items in his room. The local police chief also stated that before the day Hauptmann claimed to have discovered the gold certificates, they were unable to find evidence of their use. Furthermore, Fisch did use gold certificates to buy a ship ticket when he went to Germany. Additionally, Dr. Condon was unable to identify Hauptmann as the person who received the ransom. The case will continue to be investigated tomorrow. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(New York) Hauptmann, the suspect in the kidnapping of Lindbergh's beloved son, still firmly maintains that he had no prior knowledge of the kidnapping case. However, after handwriting experts examined the case, they determined that the fourteen notes sent to Lindbergh by the kidnapper were all written by Hauptmann. Colonel Lindbergh and his wife have departed from Los Angeles by plane to come here for the sake of confronting Hauptmann. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(New York) A prisoner named Zilin at the Columbus Prison said that the recently captured Hauptmann was the one who kidnapped Lindbergh's young son. He requested to confront Hauptmann. Baolin said that shortly before being arrested, Hauptmann told him, "Lindbergh has money; he's ripe for a hit." The crimes Hauptmann committed on Wall Street amount to around $264,000. In addition, it is reported that since Hauptmann's arrest, the other inmates in the prison have been quite solicitous towards him. Normally, prisoners can take a half-hour walk outdoors after each meal and can attend religious services on Sundays. The prison is now prohibiting Hauptmann from enjoying these two privileges.

<h3 id="e100">Sugar Industry Conference to be Held in Java <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The General Sugar Sales Organization Cannot Expand Sugar Sales</p>
<p>Affecting the Livelihoods of Workers, Sugar Factories Collectively Seek Relief</p>
<p>Batavia Correspondence: Our country's sugar production is insufficient to meet our needs, and most of the sugar used nationwide is supplied by imports. Besides Taiwan, the largest supplier is Java Island in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, the situation of the Javanese sugar industry has a profound relationship with our country's people's livelihood. Moreover, Java is the most famous sugar-producing region in the world, and its sugar industry status can further affect the world sugar market. The importance of its position is evident. This month, Javanese sugar merchants will hold a general meeting in Yogyakarta. Although the issues discussed will largely concern their own problems, one matter is particularly noteworthy: the survival of the Javanese General Sugar Sales Organization. The establishment of this organization was originally intended as a means to reduce internal competition. After the recession enveloped the world, there was a global sugar surplus. Javanese sugar factories, witnessing such large sugar stockpiles in Java, feared that further mutual competition would cause sugar prices to plummet uncontrollably. Therefore, they agreed to government intervention to organize this monopoly organization. From then on, Javanese sugar could only be sold by this organization and not by the factories themselves, and prices were fixed and not allowed to be greatly reduced. Although this practice was able to maintain Javanese sugar prices to a certain extent and prevent them from falling sharply, weaknesses were soon discovered. Since all sugar was monopolized by one organization, the factories no longer had the freedom to sell sugar, and this sales organization had no ability to promote sugar sales. As a result, Javanese sugar sales shrank daily. The factories had no choice but to reduce production or stop milling. The result not only caused the number of sugar workers losing their jobs to increase daily, but also meant that the factories that stopped milling had no source for maintaining their machinery. The Dutch East Indies sales organization had a sugar base fund to provide relief, but its effects were minimal. Moreover, the expenses required by the General Sugar Sales Organization each month were enormous and still had to be shared by the sugar factories, which was not a light burden. Therefore, most manufacturers have expressed dissatisfaction with this government approach, advocating for the dissolution of the organization, believing that the sooner the organization is dissolved, the sooner the Javanese sugar industry will turn around. The reason is that after the organization is dissolved, the sugar factories can set their own minimum prices to compete fiercely with sugar from other countries in the world market. In this way, more workers can be hired, and problems such as unemployed workers and machinery maintenance costs can be easily solved. As for the domestic perspective, famous factories can also adjust their production according to the needs of the environment. As far as the current world sugar market is concerned, it is beneficial to engage in direct competition, each fighting for themselves. Under the depressed market conditions, the trust's approach is ineffective, because there is competition from other countries' goods besides the Dutch East Indies. However, although there are now many who make this suggestion, the final decision still depends on the Yogyakarta conference. If the Dutch East Indies sales organization is dissolved, it is expected that Javanese sugar prices will plummet. From the perspective of our country's consumers, this cannot be said to be without benefit, so our country's sugar merchants should not ignore it. (13th)</p>

<h3 id="e102">Is it a Japanese-British Alliance or a Japanese-Russian Compromise? <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Although Both Have Difficulties, One Must Be Chosen Quickly</p>
<p>Observations from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun of the 18th of this month published a special telegram from its Moscow-based correspondent, Kiyoshi Kawakami, stating that before 1935, Japanese authorities must choose one of two diplomatic strategies: cooperation with Russia or an alliance with Britain. Currently, the authorities are carefully considering this issue. However, the matter of cooperation with Russia was vague and unclear to me (the Japanese reporter) before I entered Russia. Only after coming here and observing did the issue gradually become clear. Originally, after the World War, the so-called new diplomacy of various countries was only a temporary policy. Now, all European countries have turned to restoration diplomacy, that is, the great powers are making great efforts in the areas of alliances and agreements in order to seek equilibrium. Anyone who goes to the capitals of Europe can hear this constantly. In particular, the secret alliance between Germany and Poland, with Russia as its target, has sought Japan's cooperation. At the same time, Russia and France are becoming increasingly close in order to counter the German-Polish alliance. France has also wooed Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, forming a Balkan faction. Italy, in order to counter Germany, is working to seize control of Austria. They want to drag the Balkans and Bulgaria into their own sphere of influence. The current situation in Europe can be seen. As for whether the friendly relationship between Britain and Japan can be revived, its situation has also been scattered throughout the European newspapers. Looking back to the early 20th century, when the disputes between Japan and Russia were intense, Ito Hirobumi advocated cooperation with Russia in order to ease this tension. However, Japan-Russia cooperation was not liked by Britain. Because Britain wanted to strengthen its position in China and India, Afghanistan, Balochistan and other countries, it was willing to ally with Japan. With British assistance, Japan could also prevent Russia's southward expansion of power and Manchuria, and the Russo-Japanese War occurred. Now, Russia's national fortune is gradually rising. Should Japan resist the eastward expansion of Russian power and cooperate with European countries, or should it make peace with Russia to protect Japan's interests? This is a major issue at present. If Japan chooses the former, then its target should be Germany. However, today's Germany has been abandoned by the whole world. It is not cost-effective to be close to Germany. Moreover, today's Germany is immersed in European political work, while Japan is reluctant to participate in the European disputes. Therefore, the only country that can cooperate with Japan is Britain. Although Britain opposes the revival of the old alliance, it is expected that there will be no opposition to certain agreements with Japan. Moreover, recently British politicians, newspapers, and naval officers have also expressed opinions in favor of understanding with Japan. However, the trade rivalry between Britain and Japan is very fierce, which is very different from 30 years ago. Today, Japanese products are sweeping the world market, and international politics gives priority to economic relations. This kind of rivalry cannot eliminate the obstacles between Britain and Japan. As for the issue of cooperation between Japan and Russia, there are even more obstacles. Russia is widely suspected by the world, and the Middle East Road has not yet been resolved. It is not easy for Tokyo and Moscow to establish mutual trust. If Russia withdraws its armed forces from the Russian-Manchurian border, and at the same time concludes a non-aggression treaty, it may be possible to appease the situation between the two countries. This is an important policy that Japan must urgently decide on in its diplomatic policy today.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Liaoning Four Townships Volunteer Army Active <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Puppet Military Police Unable to Cope</p>
<p>Traitors Captured Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication: Recently, the volunteer army in the four townships of Liaoning Province has been extremely active. A brief account is as follows: (1) In Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, at around 11:00 a.m. on September 16, more than 100 volunteer soldiers, taking advantage of the Japanese army's live ammunition exercise, suddenly broke into the west enclosure gate from outside the east enclosure gate and shot at the sentries, killing many puppet police officers. The Tengao Fort police station in the eighth district initially thought it was a Japanese army firing practice. Only after a closer inspection did they realize that the volunteer army was taking advantage of the opportunity to act. The police station urgently telegraphed for reinforcements from a large number of Japanese puppet troops, but the volunteer army had already gone to the northwest to fight as guerrillas. (2) East of Xiama Tang Village in the eighth district of Benxi, at around 1:00 a.m. on the 15th, about 60 or 70 volunteer soldiers suddenly appeared and captured seven people, including Meng Xianzhang, Meng Xianting, Meng Xianshan, Cheng Huanwen, Cheng Qinglan, Cheng Qingfu, and Li Chunlu's son, Little Fatty, to set an example. (3) About 120 volunteers from the Sancha River, taking advantage of the tall green gauze tents, attacked the Japanese puppet military police stationed near the railway at 4:30 a.m. on the 15th of this month, fought for three hours, killed more than a dozen Japanese puppet military police, and destroyed several sections of the railway before retreating. (4) Seventy or eighty volunteer soldiers were found in the eastern township of Tieling County. They encountered a puppet army patrol team near Xinglongdian, and both sides immediately opened fire. The volunteer army feared that Japanese reinforcements would arrive in large numbers, and they quickly retreated. (5) In Xigou Village, Fengcheng County, eight miles from the city, more than 100 volunteer soldiers suddenly arrived at 6:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month. It was reported that it was Wang Daguniang's gang. It happened that a pro-Japanese person, An Huimin, was organizing a Baojia self-defense group in the village. The group members at the scene were all unarmed. The volunteer army saw an opportunity to take advantage of, surrounded them, and captured more than a dozen important pro-Japanese figures, including An Huimin. By the time the military police in the city found out, they rushed over at night, but the volunteer army had already retreated. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>The county's Anti-Smoking Committee issued instructions to the various district offices and public security bureaus to investigate and force registration, and widely issued notices, stating that the deadline for smoker registration was approaching and would not be extended. The licenses have been issued by the provincial capital. The various registered smokers are scheduled to be dispatched tomorrow (25th) by personnel carrying licenses to the various district offices to issue them together and collect license fees. The licenses are divided into two types, A and B. Type A licenses cost six yuan each, and Type B licenses cost six corners each. Those ordinary people who try to evade the regulations and fraudulently claim Type B licenses will not be allowed. Those who are truly poor must obtain proof from the township head. Wang Bangzhen has been assigned to the first district to issue licenses at the appointed time. Before the end of this month, smokers who have not yet registered can go to the district office to apply for a license. The county's opium den licenses, autonomous region No., are divided into Category A, 157 districts, Category B, 238 districts, and Category C, 46 districts. The contractors have been ordered to pay one-quarter of the fee first and submit it with the special application for a decision. The license fees are 2,400 yuan per year for Category A, 1,400 yuan per year for Category B, and 800 yuan per year for Category C. There have been many applications for sales and smoking establishments in various places, but no decision has been made.</p>

<p>Since the 128 Incident, the prosperity of Liuhe has plummeted, and bandits have sprung up everywhere.

Residents have gradually returned, and local prosperity is being restored in order. The squadron leader, Liu Rong, has been in the army for many years, so discipline is strict and relations with the public are quite harmonious.</p>

<p>Ganlu Village in this county is a large village in the northwest countryside. All the residents of the village are surnamed Qiu. A few days ago, a resident of the village named Qiu Baochuan built a new mansion with twelve large rooms. Friends and relatives came to congratulate him, and the house was filled with guests. Baochuan held a banquet to entertain them. Unexpectedly, at midnight, a fire started from accumulated firewood. In an instant, the flames soared. The Tianning Township Fire Brigade set out to put out the fire. The chief of the Public Security Bureau also led a team to rush to the scene to maintain order and direct the firefighting efforts. At that time, the north wind was strong, and the firefighting equipment was ineffective. All the houses in the entire village were reduced to ashes. It is estimated that banknotes worth five hundred yuan and soft pearls, gold ornaments, and miscellaneous items worth more than twenty thousand yuan were burned. The most regrettable thing is that the Qiu family has been scholars for generations and had a rich collection of books, including some Yuan and Ming dynasty editions, which were also destroyed by the fire god. Everyone who heard about it sighed with regret.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Rickshaw Strike Still Unresolved <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The rickshaw industry association in this county went on strike because the rickshaw companies restored the original rental fees. The strike has lasted for three days, and both sides are taking extreme positions. Yesterday, Hu Weixin, section chief of the Public Security Bureau, together with Wang Wenjin, a member of the county executive committee, convened more than ten rickshaw pullers' representatives in the county party headquarters auditorium, urging them to resume work to avoid significant losses. After repeated mediation, the representatives only agreed to an increase of five cents per rickshaw to the companies. They would only agree to an increase of one cent per rickshaw starting from October 1st, otherwise, to maintain their livelihoods, they would rather sacrifice to the end. At this point, the situation fell back into a stalemate. Today, around eight o'clock, a small number of rickshaw pullers, forced by starvation, voluntarily resumed work, but they were seen by their colleagues, who pulled their empty rickshaws back.</p>

<p>Jiaxing has been hit by a severe drought, with the fifth district being particularly high in elevation and suffering the most from the famine. Farmers have had no harvest and cannot maintain their livelihoods, so they are taking their elderly and young children to various places to beg door to door. In the past few days, in the area around the South Gate, there have been more than two hundred starving farmers, men, women, old, and young, from the fifth district and Tongxiang, Haiyan, and Haining, begging from various shops. Local figures such as Chu Fucheng prepared rice porridge to feed them a meal and took a group photo to help raise relief funds. After eating, the starving farmers went into the city to beg door to door, a very pitiful sight. At night, they slept in the open. On the 24th, even more starving farmers entered the city to beg. The local authorities have not yet been able to provide them with relief.</p>

<p>In the area of Lingdang Bridge outside the North Gate of Jiaxing, at around ten o'clock the night before last, three or four bandits robbed passing boats. A total of five boats were robbed one after another. Fortunately, they were all poor boats, so the losses were minimal. Subsequently, the Taiping Bridge Police Station telegraphed the County Public Security Bureau and the District Cadre Team to go to different locations to round up the suspects. Song Wanyi, Zhang Liu, Guo A'er, and other three suspects were arrested, and a fake pistol, wooden sticks, and knives were confiscated. The victims identified them as the perpetrators.

<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, in view of the fact that factories in our country, such as silk, yarn, and flour mills, have suffered from the dumping of foreign goods and business has plummeted, are all in a state of depression, with the silk industry being the most severe. Silk mills are closing down, and in order to seek relief, it is necessary to investigate the main reasons for their failure. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance sent technical official Zeng Liangong, and the Ministry of Industry sent section chief Li Chongdian, to various places to investigate. The day before yesterday (23rd) at around eight o'clock in the evening, Zeng and Li came to Wuxi from Zhenjiang and stayed at the New World Hotel. Yesterday (24th), together with representatives of the county government and the Chamber of Commerce, they first went to the Maoxin Wei Er Flour Mill in Ximen to investigate, and then went to the Jiufeng and Tailong Mills to investigate. They are scheduled to investigate the Shenxin, Qingfeng, and Yukang yarn mills today, and finally investigate the various silk mills, so as to make overall plans and effectively rectify the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Robbers Break In, Steal, and Injure People <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In the Panjiaqiao area on the border of Wuxi and Changzhou, about three miles away from Xueyan Bridge, a resident named Duan Baocheng, who is over fifty years old, has a son named Duan Jinzhi, who is currently teaching at the county junior high school in this county. The family is wealthy and has aroused the envy of robbers. Duan Baocheng also came to the city for business the day before yesterday, leaving only his wife, Duan Yinshi, his daughter, Duan Pinzhen, and a maid at home. Unexpectedly, at around twelve o'clock at night, more than ten robbers suddenly came, each holding guns and weapons, broke down the door, and ransacked the house at will. They also burned Duan Yinshi's hair, causing serious injuries. After half an hour, they fled with their loot. Before leaving, they fired a shot, wounding Duan Yinshi's right foot. After checking, it was found that clothes, jewelry, cash, and other items worth about six hundred yuan were stolen. The Xueyan Bridge Security Regiment has been notified to investigate and recover the stolen goods. Also, in the Hua Da Fang Village in the third district of the county, at around ten o'clock the night before last, several bandit boats sailed in from Daxi Bridge on Taihu Lake, firing shots to show their power, intending to rob. The villagers there rang gongs to alert the others and separately telegraphed the county government on behalf of the Public Security Bureau and the eighth branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge. Security teams, detective teams, patrol car teams, and detectives from the Supervision Office were dispatched to the countryside to arrest the bandits. Seeing that they could not succeed, the bandits hoisted their sails and fled, so the local area did not suffer any losses.</p>

<p>The Wujin section of the Liwu Road project was previously contracted by the county government through bidding. It was subsequently decided that Chen Youheng of the Linji Construction Engineering Office would win the bid. Since the start of construction, the workers have been working hard, so the project has now been completed. There are still a few sections that do not meet the requirements, but they can be repaired perfectly within a few days. The Linji Company, in order to pay the workers and disband them, specifically requested the county government to pay wages of five thousand yuan. The county government instructed to first issue one thousand two hundred yuan, and the rest will be verified and issued after personnel are sent to inspect the project.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Requests Reduction in License Tax <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangdu Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association stated that the amount of the tobacco and alcohol license tax for this year has increased from 12,880 yuan to 19,320 yuan. They specifically requested the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce to forward the request to the Department of Finance, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau to set a fair amount and requested the chairman to submit a request to the county asking them not to assist the county license tax collection office until the issue has been reduced in the northern Jiangsu counties. Once the province resolves the issue, they will comply with the regulations and pay the tax. The reasons they gave were roughly that the tax was changed from being handled by the ministry to being handled by the province, and the contractor was the Joint Association of Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Associations of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou, in the hope of reducing the burden and alleviating business difficulties. Unexpectedly, the situation worsened, and the new tax amount exceeded that of the southern Jiangsu counties. If they could afford it, it would be a matter of provincial tax, and they should勉繳 [Reluctantly Pay]. However, with the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of commerce, it is difficult to maintain the original amount, let alone increase it, and the increase is particularly heavy in northern Jiangsu. Such unfairness is too great. In addition to the joint office established by the tobacco and alcohol industry associations of the twenty-seven counties in northern Jiangsu in Huaiyin, Wang Jinting, Liu Dingxin, and others were publicly elected to go to the province to petition. Your association should submit a request to the county and forward it to the Department, ordering them to collect the tax as before to alleviate business difficulties, and requesting the county to assist in the collection of the tax after the provincial government resolves the issue. The county government has instructed the Chamber of Commerce that, as the case concerns provincial taxes, this government cannot forward the request and should be informed accordingly.</p>

<p>In the Nianmiao Bridge area of the sixth district, Zhang Xintian, who runs a tea stall, has a small fortune and has accumulated considerable wealth. The cotton stalks were damaged, and the seed pods did not form, resulting in no harvest, making life difficult. At this time of year, when the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest is not yet ready, many people are in danger of running out of food. On the 23rd, as many as three or four hundred village women led their elderly and young children to Zhang's house to eat. The rice and grain in the barn were all freely cooked and eaten. Because there were so many people, the Zhang family could not do anything. They then persuaded the crowd in a roundabout way and gave each person ten copper coins before they dispersed. The district office has urgently telegraphed the county government to report the matter, and County Magistrate Qu Huan has telegraphed the Nanchang Command Headquarters and the provincial government and other places, requesting the allocation of funds to organize emergency relief.</p>

<p>The abolished lunar Mid-Autumn Festival is traditionally a time for settling accounts in the second period of the year for various industries. Here, we follow the usual custom, without exception. All the shops, big and small, are extremely busy settling accounts and making payments, and the market is also relatively lively. However, due to the scarcity of crops in recent years and the economic decline, various sectors are showing signs of depression. As a result, collection and payment are difficult, and all industries are pulling together, accounting for about 30-40% of the total. Even the most successful incense and candle shops and tea and food shops (selling mooncakes) have seen a decline. There are many incense stands that are unsold. Mooncake shops usually close in the afternoon on this day, indicating that their goods have been sold out. This year, however, at eight o'clock in the evening, mooncake boxes were still piled high on the shelves, indicating that the social economy is tight, and the purchasing power is weak, making it difficult to satisfy the elegant interest in enjoying the moon.</p>

<h3 id="e127">National Congress of the Chinese Red Cross Society Opened Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A Total of 164 Representatives from Various Regions Attended</p>
<p>Personnel from the Ministry of Interior and Other Agencies Were Sent to Participate</p>
<p>The Conference is Scheduled for Four Days, and Meetings Will Continue This Morning</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society held its first National Congress of Members' Representatives in the Grand Auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning, starting at 9:00 AM. The conference was scheduled for four days. A total of 164 people attended, including Gan Naiguang, representative of the Ministry of Interior and Vice Minister; Yang Hui, representative of the Ministry of Military Affairs; Chen Tai'ao, representative of the Ministry of Navy; Zhao Tiezhang, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Wang Peiyuan, Chairman of the Red Cross Society. During the opening ceremony, representatives from various agencies delivered speeches. The meeting continued intermittently at 2:00 PM, and discussions on proposals began. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hall Arrangement: The meeting hall was located in the Grand Auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce near the Tianhou Palace Bridge. A Party-State flag and a white cloth banner reading "First National Congress of Members' Representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society" were hung above the main entrance. Inside the hall, a portrait of the late Founding Father Sun Yat-sen was hung in the center of the stage, flanked by Party-State flags. Seats were arranged for representatives from various ministries, standing committee members, news reporters, and recorders. The national flags of various countries were hung in a cross shape in the center. Red Cross white cloth flags were hung all around the hall, creating a simple yet magnificent atmosphere.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yesterday's attending representatives included Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Peiyuan, Lin Kanghou, Shen Lianfang, Wu Xiaolai, Gu Xinyi, Hong Yanbin, Dong Xinqin, Yu Chengmei, Kan Zongji, Li Yingfu, Wang Zhenchuan, Liu Ben Du, Liu Xingwu, Qin Yaojiang, Yao Yuqin, Dong Jingren, Xu Ke, Ji Zhuzhuqing, Zhou Guangjiu, Wang Jin Yuan, Wang Fu Dong, Wu Weinong, Jiang Mao Heng, Zhou Huiwen, Wang Pingru, Huang Liang Kui, and others, totaling 164 people, as well as Gan Naiguang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, Cao Zhonglin, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Civil Affairs Department, Chen Hui, Committee Member of the Military Medical Design and Supervision Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, Zhao Tiezhang, Section Chief of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Chen Tai'ao, Section Chief of the Ministry of Navy, etc.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the formal salutations, Wen Lanting, the temporary chairman, delivered a report, stating that Mr. Wang Yiting was unable to attend due to illness and had entrusted him to represent him. He expressed gratitude to the representatives for traveling from afar to gather and discuss future plans for the association, and to the military and political authorities for their guidance. He anticipated that this unprecedented event would yield satisfactory results and hoped that all representatives would express their views to improve the association's work.</p>
<p>Internal Admonition: After the chairman's report, Gan Naiguang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, delivered a speech, stating that the Chinese Red Cross Society was established in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, which is now thirty years ago. In these thirty years, it has convened two national member congresses and one special congress, all held in accordance with the association's charter. On December 6th of the 21st year, the National Government promulgated the "Regulations for the Administration of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China." On June 3rd of the following year, the Executive Yuan promulgated the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Regulations," which stipulated that the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, as designated by the Ministries of Military Affairs and Navy, should assist the rear service health work of the army, navy, and air force during wartime, and, as designated by the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs, should be responsible for disaster relief, medical treatment, and other rescue matters both domestically and internationally. It also stipulated the establishment of a general headquarters and branch offices. The Ministry of Interior was designated as the competent authority for the general headquarters, which was also subject to the supervision of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs, and Navy. The branch offices were subordinate to the general headquarters, with the local administrative authorities as the competent authority. The regulations also stipulated that the directors and supervisors of the general headquarters should be appointed by the National Government upon recommendation by the ministries. All the tasks that the Red Cross Society should undertake in peacetime and wartime, the relationship between the general headquarters and the central ministries, the relationship between the general headquarters and the branch offices and local administrative authorities, and the appointment of supervisors and directors were all clearly defined by law. With such heavy responsibilities, the government's expectations are even greater. The Ministry deeply believes that the Red Cross Society is of great importance to the national standing and the welfare of the people. Without thorough reforms, it will be difficult to achieve rapid development. Therefore, the Ministry has sent personnel to Shanghai for inspection and instructed the general headquarters to convene the first National Congress of Members' Representatives on a regular basis in accordance with the law, so as to gather comrades from all over the country, carefully select responsible personnel, and establish permanent plans to promote the cause of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China. Now that it has been held as scheduled, the Ministry is truly gratified. Here, I would like to list the Ministry's hopes for all of you attending the meeting: The Red Cross Society stands in a detached position and is responsible for providing assistance in times of war or disaster. This is a universally recognized principle. Although the Chinese Red Cross Society has made considerable efforts in the past, it lacks sufficient reserves of relief materials in peacetime and adequate training of relief personnel. In the event of an incident, it is often unable to cope adequately. The Ministry has instructed the general headquarters to draft a detailed plan for establishing hospitals, stockpiling relief materials, and training relief personnel, and to send it to the branch offices in advance for comments. The general headquarters has sorted them out and submitted them to the congress for discussion. I sincerely hope that the representatives will carefully review and agree on detailed measures and instruct the general headquarters to work hard to implement them. This is the first sincere hope that the Ministry has for the congress. The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China needs to have a complete and strict organization to fulfill its mission. The so-called strict organization not only requires the general headquarters and branch offices to be reorganized separately in accordance with the law and to elect responsible personnel, but also requires close contact between the general headquarters and the branch offices. The business and accounting of the branch offices must be subject to the supervision of the general headquarters, and the general headquarters must pay attention to guiding the branch offices at any time. The Ministry has instructed the general headquarters to draft the articles of association of the general headquarters and the branch offices and submit them to the congress for review. These articles of association embody the organizational spirit of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, and all members and staff must abide by them without fail. I sincerely hope that the representatives will do their best to deliberate and agree on them properly. This is the second sincere hope that the Ministry has for the congress. The progress of every undertaking must first establish its financial foundation. This is a principle that is not easy to follow. The annual income and expenditure of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China is no less than one million yuan. Whether the use of this money is proper and whether the income and expenditure are extravagant or wasteful requires a complete budgetary system and accounting organization, as well as an accounting inspection system, to sort it out. This is the key to the success or failure of the association's affairs and cannot be ignored. The accounts of the general headquarters have been inspected by accountants appointed by the Ministry to increase public trust. The Ministry has sent personnel to supervise the general headquarters to draft the accounting regulations of the general headquarters and the branch offices for implementation. However, the general headquarters and the branch offices have many undertakings and limited funds. How can income and expenditure be matched and budgets balanced in the future? These all need to be carefully explored. This is the third sincere hope that the Ministry has for the congress. The Red Cross Society should make every effort to solicit members widely as a fundamental requirement for completing all its plans. The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China currently has only more than 100,000 members, which is too few. It should strive to solicit members in the near future, at least 1 million people. It should also pay attention to soliciting young members, so that young people can understand the spirit of the Red Cross Society, develop their personal health habits, and train to serve the community. On the one hand, it should strive to publicize the cause of the Red Cross Society and health education to gain the trust of the people. All these matters need to be discussed and agreed upon separately in a detailed plan, and the general headquarters should be responsible for implementation. This is the fourth sincere hope that the Ministry has for the congress. All the representatives of the congress have been elected from all over the country and have been planning the development of the association's affairs for a long time. I deeply hope that everyone will do their best, work together in harmony, move forward courageously, promote the cause of social relief, and enhance the spirit of mutual assistance among human beings. This is what I earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>Representative Speech: After Gan's speech, Chen Hui, the representative of the Military Affairs Commission, delivered a speech, stating that the Red Cross Society has been established for more than 30 years and can be said to be the only international charitable organization in China. The work it has served in the past has been based on the spirit of sacrifice and has created great achievements. The Red Cross Society has made outstanding achievements in serving during wartime. Therefore, the Red Cross Society has a very close relationship with the military. Whenever a war occurs, the Red Cross Society always serves in the rear, and the local area benefits greatly. Therefore, all the work of the Red Cross Society is based on a humanitarian standpoint and aims to serve. Its spirit of sacrifice and risk-taking should be admired by us. In the future, if it can cooperate with the government and work together, the association's affairs will have a brighter future. Chen Tai'ao, representative of the Ministry of Navy, delivered a speech, stating that all the representatives are enthusiastic philanthropists. The work of your association has made great contributions to the country and society. I sincerely hope that your colleagues will continue to work hard in this spirit. The humanism and the principle of serving the public proposed by Vice Minister Gan are especially the compass that your association should have. Zhao Tiezhang, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, delivered a speech, stating that the Red Cross Society has a long history, and with a unified organization in the future, its work can increase efficiency a lot. The Red Cross Society has always taken universal love as its mission. In recent years, the international situation has become increasingly urgent. In my opinion, more attention should be paid to the work of ending wars and promoting world peace. After the representatives finished their speeches, they elected Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Peiyuan, Lin Kanghou, Shen Lianfang, and Wang Xiaolai to form the presidium.

<h3 id="e128">Ministry of Finance Plans to Build Salt Warehouses on the Four Shores <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Approved to be Collected from Salt Tax</p>
<p>The Decision to Cancel the Sail Transport at Twelve Forts Will Be Gradually Implemented</p>
<p>Plans to Open a Sack Factory to Relieve Sailors: According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Ministry of Finance is preparing to build salt warehouses on the four shores. The cancellation of sail transport at Twelve Forts is being gradually implemented due to the opposition of transport workers. Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned the following details from the General Inspectorate of Salt Affairs yesterday:</p>
<p>Building Warehouses: The Salt Affairs Administration is determined to cancel the sail transport at Twelve Forts and use steamers to reach the four shores directly. As for the detailed plan for building salt warehouses on the four shores, it has been prepared by Commissioner Miao and is now being prepared for construction. It is decided to build: (1) three warehouses on the Xiang shore: Yuezhou, Changsha, Hengyang; (2) two warehouses on the E shore: Hankou, Xinti; (3) two warehouses on the West shore: Jiujiang, Hukou; (4) two warehouses on the Wan shore: Datong, Wuhu. The construction costs will be collected from the salt tax.</p>
<p>Cancelling Sail Transport: The salt produced in the salt-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, such as Banpu, Chenjiagang, Duigou, Yanweigang, etc., was originally transported by steamer to Twelve Forts, and then transported by sail from Twelve Forts to the four shores. In the first year of the Republic of China, the salt affairs authorities planned to cancel sail transport and use steamers directly, but it was suspended due to the opposition of the sail transport workers. Now the Salt Affairs Administration is determined to cancel it, provide relief to the sail transport workers, and plans to open a sack factory to accommodate the sail transport workers. Because sacks are the most suitable for packing salt, although the sail transport workers insist on opposing it, it has been delayed and has not been implemented yet. The Salt Affairs Administration believes that the sail transport workers' opposition is unreasonable, so it has decided to implement it gradually.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Salt Affairs Inspectorate Sends Personnel to Bengbu to Thoroughly Investigate the Salt Disturbance <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>And Deal with it Opportunistically to Seek a Solution</p>
<p>Decision to Collect Taxes for the Construction of Salt Warehouses</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the salt disturbance in the Bengbu salt area is very intense, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The General Inspectorate of Salt Affairs of the Ministry of Finance specially sent commissioners Lu Siden and Jin Xiangsheng to Bengbu yesterday to investigate and find ways to mediate. Dagong News Agency reporters interviewed Secretary Shen of the Inspectorate General Office yesterday, who gave the following details:</p>
<p>The Cause of the Disturbance is Investment Competition: The cause of this salt disturbance in the Bengbu salt area has been rumored, and the reports in various newspapers have many misunderstandings about the truth of the cause. In fact, the most important cause of the disturbance is the loan incident between salt merchants and the banking industry, and the salt affairs agencies are secondary. The amount of salt entering and leaving Bengbu each year is very large. The banking industry is happy to invest in this kind of fixed production business. Initially, only the Bank of China invested, and later the Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Jiangsu Bank, etc. successively invested in the salt area and loaned money to salt merchants, competing with each other. This year, due to the increase in salt production and the decrease in sales, merchants and people in the salt area unanimously demanded that banks invest and reduce loan interest rates. The banks insisted on the original rules, so the dispute brewed and became increasingly profound. The Bengbu Salt Affairs Inspection Office was afraid that both sides would tend to extremes and affect tax revenue, so it tried to mediate, but both sides refused to give in, and the salt merchants misunderstood the official interference, so it caused a serious disturbance. This is the inside story of the cause of the disturbance.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate and Deal with it Opportunistically: Since the salt merchants misunderstood and caused the disturbance, the Ministry of Finance believed that the conflict between the investing banks and the merchants and people in the salt area was unresolved for a long time, which indirectly affected the national tax revenue. It instructed the office to conduct mediation, so it specially sent Deputy Inspector General Lu Siden and Jin Xiangsheng, former tax commissioner of Bengbu and current manager of the Yangzhou Inspection Office, to Bengbu yesterday to investigate. The two commissioners are very harmonious with the merchants and people in the Bengbu salt area and are very familiar with the local situation. Although they are tasked with investigating the disturbance, they can find ways to mediate when necessary and will probably be able to solve it soon.</p>
<p>Collecting Taxes for the Construction of Salt Warehouses: Finally, the reporter asked whether the Ministry of Finance planned to borrow 10 million yuan from the banking industry to build salt storage warehouses and develop the salt area. Secretary Shen replied that this news was a rumor and was not true. He had already clarified it. However, the construction of salt warehouses in Bengbu is indeed planned, and the expenses will not be borrowed from the banking industry, but will only be collected from the salt area to be used as construction expenses. The method of collecting taxes still needs to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval before it can be implemented. At present, the disturbance has not been resolved, and the salt warehouse plan has been put on hold for the time being, to be carried out after the disturbance subsides.</p>

<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Kim Gu, a member of the Korean Revolutionary Party, carries out various activities by supernatural means. According to Japanese investigations, the bombing case in Hongkou Park the year before last was planned by Kim. However, after the incident, searches were conducted everywhere, but he has not been captured for more than two years. It is now reported that the Japanese side has stepped up the arrest. Kim has recently sent many people to operate in Goryeo and Northeast China. More than 20 pro-Japanese Koreans have also been heard in this port and various parts of the mainland to help with the search. The purpose is not to capture Kim Gu alive. If there is an opportunity, it is permissible to dispose of him on the spot. It is also permissible to kill him.</p>

<p>Yangzhou National Exhibition Closes Today</p>
<p>Jiangxi Requests Reduced Transportation Costs and Tax Exemption</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Ends with a Summary of Income and Expenses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, recently because the Yangzhou National Products Exhibition is closing today, has specially initiated the Jiangxi Provincial Capital National Products Exhibition. Since the preparation, participating manufacturers have been very enthusiastic. Also, all income and expenditure accounts of the Zhenjiang National Exhibition have been settled and reported separately. The following are details from a reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency:</p>
<p>Request for Reduced Transportation Costs and Tax Exemption: The association believes that since the exhibition of national products is mainly for promotion, it should make every effort to seek cost savings for the participating manufacturers of the Jiangxi exhibition. Yesterday, the association specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Railways for the issuance of reduced-fare transportation orders and free orders, as well as reduced boat and train fares, to ease the burden on various factories and maximize promotion. The original text is as follows: "Submitting a request for holding the Jiangxi Provincial Capital National Products Exhibition, humbly requesting the granting of reduced-fare (tax-exemption orders) to facilitate the promotion of national products. We believe that promoting national products places primary importance on promotion. National products exhibitions are the most effective way to promote national products. This association, recognizing the importance of promoting national products, has initiated the Jiangxi Provincial Capital National Products Exhibition to provide people in the interior with the opportunity to recognize national products and arouse their interest in using them. We have already sent personnel to Jiangxi to negotiate properly and have repeatedly received letters and telegrams of welcome from various sectors of the Jiangxi provincial party and government, and have designated Nanchang Dacheng Park as the venue. This association has already begun preparations. However, since the exhibition of national products is mainly for promotion, it is different from commercial profiteering. The expenses of participating manufacturers should be reduced as much as possible to lighten their burden and maximize promotion. Now, the distance between Shanghai and Jiangxi Province is far, and the cost of traveling by boat and train is quite high. If the transportation costs for participating manufacturers are the same as those for ordinary stores, the burden will be too heavy. Therefore, we specially submit this document to your ministry, humbly requesting the granting of reduced-fare transportation orders and tax-exemption orders, and requesting that state-owned merchant ships be consulted to allow for special preferential reduced-fare transportation of exhibition goods, and to reduce boat and train fares, in order to reduce the burden and facilitate the promotion of national products, which is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Communications (the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways are similar)."</p>
<p>Yangzhou National Exhibition Closing: The association's participation in the Jiangdu County National Products Exhibition, with a duration of three weeks, has reached its expiration date and is scheduled to close today. Liu Zhongying, a standing committee member of the association, took an early train to the province yesterday morning to host the closing ceremony of the National Products Exhibition. According to Chen Binghui, a standing committee member of the association, the Yangzhou National Exhibition was not as prosperous as the Zhenjiang exhibition due to the continuous autumn rain after the opening. According to statistics, the total business volume in three weeks was more than 134,200 yuan, and the total number of visitors was more than 118,100. Yesterday, the association requested the Shanghai North Station and Zhenjiang Station to allocate hanging cars to transport the remaining goods and items from the Yangzhou exhibition, and was deeply grateful. Now, the Jiangdu County National Products Exhibition, which was continued by this association from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou, has reached its expiration date and is scheduled to close on the 25th of this month. There are about 200 participating manufacturers who plan to return to Shanghai by train from Zhenjiang Station on the 27th of this month. Because there are still many remaining goods and items, we request your office to allocate two hanging cars to drive to Zhenjiang for loading. The time will be determined by your office, and the ticket prices will also be discounted as usual. A corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that you will investigate and reply accordingly.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Exhibition Income and Expenditure Accounts: The Zhenjiang National Exhibition previously held by the association closed on the 26th of last month. All income and expenditure accounts of the National Exhibition handled by the association have been settled. Yesterday, the association specially submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Social Bureau for record. The original submission stated: "Submitting a report regarding the matter. This association led the Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Touring Group to participate in the Jiangsu Provincial Capital National Products Exhibition on August 1st, which closed on August 26th. All income and expenditure accounts have been settled. The total income was 5,156 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1 cent. The total expenditure was 5,539 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 fen. The difference between income and expenditure is 383 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen, which is temporarily covered by the income from the preparation site fees of the Jiangdu County National Products Exhibition. In addition to submitting separate reports for record, we respectfully submit two copies of the income and expenditure settlement statement to your association for review and approval, hoping that you will grant record-keeping, which is in the public interest."</p>

<h3 id="e138">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Re-Wires the Executive Yuan and Ministry to Recover the Pilotage Management Right <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Appealing to Comply with Public Sentiment</p>
<p>And Not to Repeat Past Malpractices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly telegraphed the government to strive to recover the pilotage management right. Yesterday, it wired the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and other agencies, stating: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing. On the 22nd of this month, we received a letter from the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilots Association stating that the Interim Regulations on Pilotage Management, which were formulated by the government in September of last year, were soon opposed by customs advisors who advocated revision and sought the opinions of various countries on whether they agreed to determine the course of action. The authorities, adhering to their instructions, distorted and changed the pilotage regulations again and again. The important points of the original regulations were almost entirely altered, such as allowing them to maintain the existing positions of foreign pilots and stipulating that new foreign pilots could still be employed when necessary. The management right and the examination right must be subject to others. The right does not belong to us, and we are also willing to tie our own hands diplomatically, creating a coordinated situation. The so-called recovery of pilotage is a line of hope that has been cut off from this point. Our association, having received reliable information from the foreign side, has repeatedly reported the situation in telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Executive Yuan, requesting that the revised regulations be submitted to relevant groups for joint study before they are approved and promulgated. However, our voices were hoarse, and our appeals were ignored until we were ignored. The current situation is such that the result is foreseeable. It is now heard that the revised new regulations will be implemented on the 1st of next month. If they are allowed to be promulgated, a big mistake will be made. With the strength of the Chinese people, there is no way to save it. Therefore, we specially prepare a letter to present the situation and request your association to vehemently state the advantages and disadvantages and strive again. If it is not adopted, please announce the entire process of recovering the pilotage to the people of the country to see that your association's participation by representatives is based on protecting the country as a prerequisite and does not go along with those who eat meat, so as not to take the blame for others and to avoid being a scapegoat. In terms of merit and crime, there will be public opinion for thousands of years. We dare to base our advice on the wise and speak frankly, and we hope that you will investigate and reply, which is truly desirable. The pilotage profession is related to maritime rights and military opportunities, no less than the lifeblood of a country. Sovereignty cannot be borrowed for a long time. If the right of management and examination is in the hands of foreigners, and new pilots can still be employed as usual, then the so-called recovery of the water management right is tantamount to buying a casket and returning the pearl. The government has repeatedly shown the people of the country that it will revise unequal treaties. If the General Regulations on Pilotage in various ports, which have no treaty basis, are subject to foreign interference and cannot be thoroughly revised, then the so-called revision of treaties is no different from a mirage and is even more distant. How can we comfort the aspirations of hundreds of millions of people? Therefore, we do not avoid bothering you and make our final appeal to urge the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to weigh the advantages and disadvantages and comply with public sentiment, and not to let the malpractices of the General Regulations on Pilotage of 1907 be seen again today and become an indelible scar in diplomatic history. This is our most sincere prayer. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Chamber of Commerce Re-Wires the Ministry of Finance to Oppose the Scrapping of Old Stamp Tax Tickets <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Merchants' Pre-Paid Tax Payments Should Not Be Confiscated</p>
<p>Please Allow Exchange for New Stamps to Alleviate Merchants' Difficulties</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce re-wired the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing. In accordance with the Ministry's announcement that new stamp tax tickets will be issued starting from November 1st of this year, and the old stamp tax tickets will be abolished, our association previously received letters and telegrams from the Jinhua County Chamber of Commerce and the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce in Zhejiang Province, requesting that we forward them to withdraw the order. We wired the Ministry on the 12th of this month. Recently, we received a telegram from the Zhenhai County Chamber of Commerce in Zhejiang Province on the 21st of this month, stating that our members in the money industry, pawn industry, sauce garden, etc., have successively sent letters stating that they were shocked to read the Ministry of Finance's announcement that new stamp tax tickets with pagoda patterns will be issued starting from November 1st, and at the same time, all old stamps will be abolished and cannot be used again, and those who violate this will be punished. Since many years ago, merchants have been forced to purchase stamps by the collection agencies, resulting in a large number of accumulated stamps. Although they reluctantly purchased them at that time, they were originally intended for daily use. Even if there are accumulated stamps, they can still be temporarily used as assets. Once they are abolished, the loss will be unbearable. Our association members vow not to recognize this and request your association to argue for it according to reason, etc., arriving at the association. Based on this, the association convened an emergency executive committee meeting to discuss it. It was unanimously agreed that stamp tax tickets are issued by the government. If old tickets can be abolished due to the issuance of new tickets, then all valuable securities and bank notes can be issued and abolished at will. The government can obtain a huge amount of illegal income, but the people cannot bear the illegal marrow extraction. Is this tolerable? What is not tolerable? The case concerns the merchants' pain and suffering. Therefore, we are calling on your help. It was resolved that in addition to wiring the Ministry of Finance to amend the order and allow the continued use of accumulated stamps or allow the exchange of new stamps, we specially wire your association to take effective action immediately until the goal is achieved, etc. On the same day, we also received telegrams from the Chaichiao Township Chamber of Commerce in Zhenhai County on the 21st of this month, stating the same reasons, etc. We have approved these. It is found that the stamp tax is a national tax, and merchants have purchased and accumulated a large number of stamps as a pre-payment of taxes, which is a virtue of being brave in paying taxes and should be commended. Now, their pre-paid tax payments are confiscated and invalidated, and they are required to pay again. There is nothing more unfair than this. Moreover, the stamp tax tickets should be deemed to have completed the tax payment at the time of use and cancellation. If new tickets are issued and old tickets are prohibited, it is not the government's intention to show compassion for merchants and encourage tax payment. Therefore, we re-wire the Ministry for review and humbly request that the order be withdrawn and that the old tickets continue to be valid, or that the old tickets be allowed to be exchanged for new tickets to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>The Doors and Windows Around are Locked for Unknown Reasons</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Overseas Chinese Trust Company was established on July 4, 1933, and registered with the US government. The total capital was 1 million yuan in national currency, and the paid-up capital was 500,000 yuan, divided into 100,000 shares, each with a face value of 10 yuan. The chairman of the board was Chen Zipei, and the directors were Mei Qiju, Zheng Songyao, Zheng Zaochi, Yuan Liangchu, Liang Ying, and Chen Guochen. The general manager was Mei Qiju. The head office was located at the corner of Sichuan Road and Hong Kong Road in Shanghai. The business types were (1) trust, (2) banking, (3) real estate, (4) securities, and (5) guarantee. Yesterday, the head office suddenly hung a sign saying "Due to the clearing of accounts, business will be suspended for a few days." All the doors and windows around the head office were locked, and no one was inside. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter inquired with the silver and money industry, but they did not know the details. The reason for the clearing is difficult to understand.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Qian Peigao's Revenge Case Confirmed by An'nan County <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Lawyers' Association Has Submitted a Petition for Amnesty</p>
<p>In October of last year, student Qian Peigao, in order to avenge his father, stabbed He Zunfu, the former magistrate of An'nan County, Guizhou Province, at the Golden Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. The court sentenced Qian to seven years in prison. Qian's defense lawyer, Qian Shusheng, checked the files and Qian's confession and suggested that Qian's conduct was commendable and requested the Shanghai Lawyers' Association to forward it to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for the issuance of an amnesty. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Qian Peigao's assassination of He Zunfu was indeed to avenge his father, as confirmed by the current magistrate of An'nan County, Yan Shibin, in his reply to the court's inquiry. The original letter is extracted below. The Second Special District Court sent a letter to An'nan County investigating several points: (1) Summon Chen Guangjiong, Ma Shenxiang, Guo Yiguang, Chou Zhushi, Jiang Nanhai, etc., to the county to inquire about why Qian Bing (i.e., Qian Bin) was shot by Zhou Haitao of the An'nan County garrison or framed by Magistrate He Zunfu. (2) Inquire whether the above persons are gentry in An'nan County. (3) Summon Qian Bing's wife, Dai, to the case to inquire about the reason for her husband's murder and who killed him. (4) Whether Qian Bing served as the Director of the Finance Bureau when He Zunfu was the magistrate of An'nan County, and whether he borrowed 1,000 yuan and 400 taels of opium from him, etc. We have checked and found that Chen Guangjie, Shu Zhushi, etc., are indeed local gentry in An'nan County. At that time, the gentry and Xian Bing's wife and merchant Liu Ziyuan and others were summoned for inquiry, and the statements were recorded separately. However, after investigation, former Magistrate He Zunfu colluded with garrison commander Zhou Haitao to secretly shoot the Director of the Finance Bureau Qian Bing without specifying what crime Qian Bing had committed and reported it to the senior government for verification of the case. There was no case to be found. This case was actually caused by the failure of former Magistrate He's request and the hatred of his brother He Yingxian, which led to bribing the garrison to assassinate Qian Bing. At that time, our county magistrate was the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the Fifth Regiment of the Second Division of the National Revolutionary Army. After the incident, he was ordered to station in An'nan County, so he knew the inside story. However, for the sake of caution, he specially reported it to Liu Mingxiang, the senior officer of the An'nan garrison at the time, to make it clear. We have received a reply from Brigade Commander Liu stating that He's case was handled entirely by He alone, and the military had nothing to do with it. When Qian Bing was executed, he also asked Zhou Haitao, who was stationed in the county, to supervise the execution. Now that the Shanghai court has inquired, your brother can tell the truth. It has nothing to do with the military. We believe that there are regulations for homicide, but Qian Bing's son killed He Zunfu because of his father's irreconcilable hatred, and his filial piety is commendable. Your Honor advocates justice and preserves Qian Peigao's filial piety, which is truly a public service. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association also believes that Qian's filial piety is commendable and has submitted a document to the Executive Yuan requesting the issuance of an amnesty and has submitted the entire case file to the Executive Yuan for verification.</p>

<p>The China Health Association has recently received representatives from the Hubei Shanghai Association, who are preparing to set up a disaster relief committee for the floods and droughts in the province. They said that the disaster situation in Hubei Province this year is extremely serious, and the drought-stricken areas are particularly vast, with more than 40 counties affected. The number of victims exceeds 10 million, and the number of extremely poor people who are in urgent need of relief is reported to be several million. At a joint meeting of various groups on September 13th, the association publicly elected Guan Jiongzhi, Han Juemin, Yin Guanzhi, and Yuan Xiaolun as four committee members to represent all members and formally invite your association to sincerely appeal for help. We hope that you will be willing to contact us at that time. It is said that recently, a typhoon struck the East China Sea, causing a terrible disaster. Shanghai, as a gathering place for Chinese and foreigners, was spared the disaster thanks to God's blessing. The telegrams reported by our eastern neighbors make people shudder. Such a strange disaster in Hubei Province, all gentlemen and good people, are lovers of kindness. Those who save others from disaster will surely create their own blessings. We hope that all patriotic and enthusiastic compatriots will save money on food and clothing to save these remnants.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Yixing County People Beg Various Sectors for Relief <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yixing County's terrain is backed by mountains and faces lakes, and most of the fields are high-lying. This year, it has suffered a severe drought, and the disaster has been particularly severe. It is learned that the local gentry in the county have organized the Yixing County Drought Relief Association and issued a tearful appeal on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of starving people in the county, stating: "To charity groups and philanthropists across the country, Yixing is located between the three major river basins of Taihu Lake, Tao Lake, and Ge Lake, and has always been known as a water town. In previous years, floods have been a disaster, and we have only known how to prevent water disasters. But this year is very different. From spring to summer to autumn, except for two rains of an inch or so during Arbor Day and World Labor Day, it has been sunny and rainless. During the Dragon Boat Festival and the summer solstice, which is the busiest time, the weather was abnormal, and it was suddenly extremely hot, fanned by strong winds and exposed to the scorching sun, causing the planting season to be delayed, the unmown wheat fields to crack, and the sown rice to wither. The local gentry raised a large sum of money to purchase motor boats, and they were also blessed by the authorities, who allocated more boats to rescue them with all their might. Eventually, the rivers and canals became land, and all previous efforts were abandoned. It is even more lamentable that tens of thousands of acres of fertile land have turned into stone, and thousands of miles of red land have turned into barren land. It is truly a strange event in the past for a water town to suffer such a severe drought. It is difficult to obtain drinking water, let alone irrigation. It has become a major problem related to human life. Now it is the autumnal equinox, which is usually the time for harvesting. Only then did we get thunderstorms, but they were less than a foot deep. The withered rice in the fields, although revived, is not fruitful. The replanted by-products, although sown, do not sprout. Looking around the county, hundreds of thousands of starving refugees, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, are wandering aimlessly. Groups are forming and venturing into danger. Among them, nine out of ten houses are empty, and there are those who have no money to lend. There are those who are in imminent danger. Some have not eaten for several days and have starved to death. Some are reluctantly begging for food, and some have developed a pessimistic attitude and have even committed suicide with their families. What crime have the people of Yixing committed to suffer such suffering? It is cruel and tragic. If water demons are at work, there is still an autumn harvest to rely on. If the drought demon is prevalent, there is complete despair, and it is difficult to survive. From 1907 to 1932, we have suffered from floods, typhoons, insect plagues, and the disasters of war in the year of the Jiazi. The warehouses in the entire area have long been depleted, and all public funds have been exhausted. The vitality has not been restored, but Heaven has not helped us. We are now facing the greatest and most unprecedented drought in the history of Yixing. A great catastrophe has come, and grief is everywhere. Without seeking help, how can we be renewed? We are exhausted and have launched a fundraising campaign and made a drought disaster film. In addition to recommending representatives to present to the authorities to beg for help, we hope that the people of the Party and the country, as well as various charitable organizations, institutions, and great philanthropists, will not tire of doing good, embrace each other, and see the prevalence of benevolence and the widespread praise. We also ask you to generously donate to help the remnants. The merits are immeasurable. We respectfully bow our heads and appeal to you from the bottom of our hearts. The entire staff of the Yixing Drought Relief Committee."</p>

<p>The Puzhao River is one of the largest currents in this port, with the Zhaojiabang to the east and the Puhuitang to the west. Due to the proliferation of factories on the west bank of the Zhaojiabang, wastewater accumulated. Two years ago, Ma Xiangbo and others suggested that the Tianyao Bridge dam be changed into a channel, exiting southward through the Caohejing Port from the small gate. Since its dredging, the source has been clean, and the people have benefited. Unexpectedly, the French Municipal Council, for some unknown reason, is building a very large sewer in the west of Xujiahui, intending to discharge all the wastewater of the entire concession through it. What was once clean will soon become polluted again. Therefore, the people suddenly became alarmed. Yesterday, the Puhuitang Promotion Committee held a meeting at Gu's residence in Chengjiaqiao. More than 60 people attended, including Gu Rungui, Yang Fuyuan, Pan Boxian, Tang Puzhuang (from Shanghai), Shen Caigeng, Li Wenlai, Li Qixian, Gu Junjie (from Songjiang), Yang Xueqiao, Wang Jingsheng, Wang Daoxing, and Jin Qiancheng (from Qingpu). Gu Rungui was elected as chairman, and Tang Puzhuang as the recorder. The chairman first announced the purpose of the meeting. For a time, the crowd was filled with anger. As a result, it was resolved that Ma Xiangbo would take the lead in submitting a petition to the municipal government and sending a letter to the Chinese directors of the French Municipal Council, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, in the hope that the sewer outlet would be moved and the sewage would flow eastward, not into the inland. Otherwise, they would build a dam foundation in Tushanwan to prevent the sewage from flowing westward as a last resort.</p>

<p>The "Nüsheng" bi-monthly publication issued by the Nüsheng She (Women's Voice Society) at 169 Yuanmingyuan Road in this port has long been well-known. Yesterday, a tea party was held at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road to celebrate with all circles. More than 60 people attended, including reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, principals of various schools, and Tong Naiqi, Huang Biyao, Guo Butao, and others.

<p>Work Relief Can Be Organized After the Autumn Harvest</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters believes that this year has been a long drought without rain, and the land is scorched for thousands of miles. The Pudong area has suffered even more. Now that the municipal government has decided to allocate funds to dredge the city's rivers, it is specially requested that the Public Works Bureau dredge the Huangtong Port as soon as possible. Now that the autumn harvest is over, work relief can be organized. The original letter said, "(Omitted above) Now that the municipal government has decided to allocate funds to dredge the city's rivers as a precautionary measure, it seems that the Gaoqiao area should also be included in the budget. However, the rivers in the Gaoqiao area are intricate and difficult to dredge one by one. The Huangtong Port reaches the Huangpu River to the outside and the hinterland to the inside, making it an important main river. It seems that it should be dredged first. Now that the autumn harvest has been completed and agricultural work is about to end, dredging the river can provide work relief and will not hinder agricultural land, which is a win-win situation. It can enrich people's livelihoods and comfort people's expectations." (Omitted below)</p>

<h3 id="e151">Western Dye Merchants Contract to Sell Japanese Indigo Coming to Shanghai <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xingzai and Others of the Chengzhi Store Organize the Far East Trading Company</p>
<p>Someone Sent a Bomb and a Warning Letter the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Last month, the Shanghai Western Dye Industry Association suddenly received a confidential letter signed by the National Youth Corps and another anonymous letter accusing businesses such as Chengzhi Wu Xingzai, Ruitai Li Shuyan, Ruihe Wu Renbao, Yukang Wang Pengcheng, Dehe Gongji Qiu Hongsheng, and Gonghe Lai Shenqinshun of contracting with Japanese merchants to sell 3 million taels of indigo under the name of the Far East Trading Company, attempting to monopolize the market. The industry association, not wanting to ignore this, convened a meeting to discuss how to deal with the situation, as reported in the previous newspaper. However, no progress has been seen so far. The following is a description of the investigation. People who care about society will certainly not take it lightly.</p>
<p>Organizing a New Company It is reported that the aforementioned businesses organized the Far East Trading Company specifically to contract the sale of Japanese indigo. To avoid contract disputes with De Fu Yanghang, Nanxing Yanghang, and Ciba Dye Factory, it was decided that the Far East Trading Company would come forward to contract the sale from Japan, while they secretly manipulated it. The total amount was indeed 3 million taels, which was divided and stockpiled by the businesses, with the intention of speculating in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Goods to Be Shipped According to reliable information received yesterday, the original price of the Japanese indigo was 50 taels per barrel, meaning that 3 million taels would amount to a huge 60,000 barrels. The goods were originally scheduled to be delivered in early this month. However, after being discovered by others and the German merchant De Fu Yanghang raised serious questions to the contracting businesses, fearing complications, the matter was temporarily shelved invisibly. However, it is still being pursued vigorously in secret, and it is possible that it will arrive in Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<p>Seizing the Opportunity to Manipulate It is said that the businesses' intention to contract Japanese indigo was due to the instability of the situation in the Far East. They predicted that once the situation in the Far East broke out, the source of German indigo would be difficult to obtain. At that time, they could hoard the rare goods and make ten times the original purchase price. At the same time, with the needs of the market, they could seize the opportunity to manipulate it for a while.</p>
<p>A Bomb After this incident, although the businesses once published a notice in the newspaper to deny it, because there was no thorough investigation and no results were announced, they were still not understood by some people. As a result, a bomb was suddenly sent to Chengzhi Dye Store the day before yesterday, along with a warning letter. Although the contents of the letter have not been seen, it is speculated that it is nothing more than patriotic action.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Setting Up a Tide Gauge Outside Wusong Estuary <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Located at Tongsha Sandbar</p>
<p>Under Construction</p>
<p>Tidal rise and fall is most closely related to merchant ships. The rise and fall of sea tides outside the Wusong Estuary is essential knowledge for coastal ships. However, until now, there has been no tide gauge installed, which is a major shortcoming. In view of this, the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department is building a tide gauge base on the sandbar of Tongsha in the sea outside Wusong. A tide gauge with a displacement of 100 tons made of cement is being sunk on the Tongsha sandbar. At the lowest tide, it can be seen 8 feet above the water, and at high tide, it is level with the sea surface. The position of the tide gauge is 88.5 degrees due north of the Nanhui surveying marker, at 122 degrees 6 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 5 minutes north latitude. A unmanned light has now been installed on the base. Once the weather is calm, workers and technicians will be sent to the base to install a marker post and install a sea tide gauge to telegraph the daily tide rise and fall to various sea vessels at any time, in order to reduce the risk of merchant ships grounding. The location of the tide gauge base is outside the hydrographic route and has nothing to do with ships traveling to and from Shanghai and other routes. The installation of this project is truly good news for the shipping industry in this port.</p>

<p>Full Text of the Ten Articles of His Handwritten Voluntary Letter</p>
<p>Details Huang's Relationship with Women</p>
<p>Since the disappearance of lawyer Huang Huancheng, this newspaper has disclosed it, and various newspapers have also published it in succession. However, according to a report in a certain newspaper the day before yesterday, Huang himself is now in Zhenjiang and has sent a letter to his colleague lawyer Zhang Shiying, who explained the reasons for Huang's sudden abandonment of his family and solo escape. In order to carefully investigate the matter, this reporter specially visited the main character in this case, Ms. Chen Jiying from Yixing, and Mr. Zhou, the main introducer of Huang and Chen's marriage at the time, and obtained a lot of materials. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Ms. Chen's Words Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Ms. Chen Jiying and obtained the following conversation (the following are all Ms. Chen's words): I met Huang last winter through the introduction of Mr. Zhou Jingming and Mr. Zheng Shengguang. At that time, Huang was very flattering and vowed to marry me as his wife. Because Huang was of high birth and had a good practice, I agreed to his request. Huang also claimed that it was his first marriage and that he was only 27 years old. However, for the sake of prudence, when we got married this spring, in addition to the two introducers, Zhou and Zheng, I specially asked for proof from many people to be cautious.</p>
<p>Huang Huancheng, Chen Jiying, Li Huifang</p>
<p>Voluntary Letter Chen said that she immediately took out a handwritten voluntary letter from Huang and showed it to me. It is transcribed as follows: I, Huang Huancheng, am 27 years old, born on the 19th day of the tenth month at Chen time, Chen Jiying, 22 years old, born on the 13th day of the eighth month at You time, because both parties are in love and voluntarily grow old together, and the conditions are listed on the right: (1) After signing this voluntary letter, the woman is a member of the man's family, and the man shall bear the woman's lifelong living expenses, etc. (2) Both parties voluntarily grow old together for life, and neither party may repent halfway unless one party violates this agreement. (3) The woman must continue her studies, and all expenses shall be provided by the man. (4) The man shall be responsible for supporting the woman's mother, and shall not be responsible for supporting anyone other than the woman's mother. (5) This matter is not a sale or abduction, and the parties may not sue, and outsiders may not use this to blackmail. (6) Children born after the signing of this voluntary letter shall be regarded as legitimate children. (7) The woman shall follow the man into the countryside, but the man shall not leave the woman alone in a foreign country without reason. (8) After signing this agreement, both parties shall not engage in any improper or immoral behavior, and each may supervise and advise each other. (9) The man shall give the woman a gift of 300 yuan. (10) This agreement is made in duplicate, and each party shall hold one as proof. February 10, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Huang Huancheng (signed), Chen Jiying (signed), Witness for the man: Ling Wenjie (inserted), Witness for the woman: Chen Chu (ten), Introducer: Wang Chunyang (correct), Lü Haiqing (ten), Wang Qingshan (ten), Tang Hongjun (ten), Zhou Jingming (signed), Zheng Shengguang (inserted).</p>
<p>The Cui and Zhang Families Chen continued, "Since my marriage to Huang, I gradually saw a big change in Huang's attitude, and Huang was very secretive about letters from his family. I became suspicious and paid attention to everything. Once, Huang's relatives came to Shanghai from Taizhou, and I took the opportunity to inquire about his family affairs. I learned that Huang was indeed married in his hometown, and his wife, Ms. Cui, had already given birth to a son and a daughter. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, when Huang came to Shanghai and worked as a professor at Yalu Middle School, he seduced a woman surnamed Zhang from a good family outside the North Gate of Taizhou and brought her to Shanghai, sending Zhang to the Kunfan Girls' School on Mei Bai Ke Road. At that time, Huang also vowed to marry Zhang, but Huang abandoned her after the event. Later, the woman surnamed Zhang returned to her hometown in frustration and has now become mentally ill due to anger."</p>
<p>Another Marriage Contract She took out a photo and a marriage invitation card and showed them to me. On the photo, the words "Brother Huancheng, Sister Li Huifang" were written in pen. The invitation card reads "Huancheng and Huifang, introduced by Mr. Chen Maoyun and Mr. Peng Tiehu, with the consent of both parties and the permission of the parents, will be engaged on December 14, 19th year of the Republic of China. We hereby inform you, Huang Huancheng and Li Huifang." According to Chen, Huang was also engaged to this Ms. Li, but was later abandoned by Huang. Therefore, when Huang practiced law in Shanghai, whenever a client asked him to publish a notice in the newspaper, Huang always used the three words "Lawyer Huang" and did not dare to use the two words "Huancheng" at first, fearing that Ms. Li would come to ask questions.</p>
<p>Two Points of Explanation Chen finally stated that Huang's intention to abandon me this time has become an undeniable fact. As for someone saying that I have bad habits, or that I am a concubine discarded by an official, and that these were the reasons for Huang's departure, it is not worth the laughter of connoisseurs. Regarding the first point, I have given up smoking cigarettes in recent months, let alone other things. As for the second point, it is even more nonsense. Even if I had both, I might as well formally divorce, so why run away quietly, like an escape? This is something that even a fool would not do, let alone Huang, who is a lawyer? Now I have decided to argue, on the one hand, to seek legal solutions, and on the other hand, to ask for social assistance. I will not give up until I achieve my goal.</p>
<p>The Words of the Introducer At this point, the reporter excused himself and went to visit the introducer, Mr. Zhou Jingming. According to him, I (Zhou Jun refers to himself) am a cousin of Huang, but we have been apart for a long time and do not know much about Huang's family affairs. If I had known that Huang had a wife at that time, I would never have been willing to be a puppet. In short, Huang's departure without saying goodbye and abandoning Ms. Chen is inconsistent with morality and human relations. However, for the sake of protecting Huang, I deeply hope that he can repent as soon as possible, return to Shanghai immediately, and negotiate formally, so as to avoid the expansion of the situation and cause grief.</p>
<p>The number of plague-infected pigs that died of illness reached as many as 70 to 80. From July, August, and September, there were more than 4,000 in total. Therefore, the dead pig oil refining factory could not cook and refine them in time, and the rotten dead pigs were buried on the spot, causing a foul odor to spread, which was unbearable to smell and made people feel like vomiting for three months. All Chinese and Western people who come to Song to visit the seaside cover their noses and pass by. Tang Chengzong, the Wusong Municipal Committee member, has reported to the municipal government for the sake of public health, requesting the relocation of the oil refining factory and other details, which has been reported by this newspaper. Since mid-September, the weather has turned cold and the number of plague-infected pigs has decreased greatly, but there are still more than ten a day. However, the daily accumulation of dead pigs, internal organs, and other rotten and smelly things is not a small number. The Health Bureau Inspection Office has great difficulties in dealing with the problem of disposing of these filthy objects. It is said that the plan proposed in the absence of a solution is to build a huge concrete pond near the oil refining factory to store dead pigs' internal organs and other things to prevent the odor from overflowing, and then find a way to transport them to a distant place for burial. A special report has been submitted to the municipal government for approval. It is heard that the municipal government has ordered the Public Works Bureau to send personnel to Song to assess the situation the day before yesterday. However, the cost of building the pond is about 1,000 yuan. At present, the Health Bureau is unable to raise such a large sum of money in a short period of time and is currently deliberating.</p>
<h3 id="e155">American Woman Injured Under Suspicious Circumstances <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Driver of the Car is Nowhere to Be Found</p>
<p>The Nature of the Wound is Not Specified by the Doctor</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the wife of American expatriate Trisquel, who is nearly middle-aged, was found lying on the ground unconscious near the Verdun apartment on Pushi Road at 6 am on Sunday. She had a wound on her left temple that was bleeding profusely. She was immediately sent to the hospital, but the person who sent her was nowhere to be found. According to police authorities, the injured woman resides at 153 Shengmu Yuan Road. On Saturday night, she invited friends to drink at her residence. Around 10 o'clock, they went to the Jai Alai Stadium and stayed for about two or three hours. Then they went to a dance hall on Hague Road, where many friends had fun until Sunday morning before dispersing. The woman left quietly after 4 o'clock, without any arguments or anger. It is also said that she hired a car to leave. Now there are two doubts that the French police have not yet resolved. One is that the driver of the car that the woman was riding in that day has not been found. The other is where the woman was going in the car. It is said that she was going to visit a friend who lived in Verdun Village. However, some people have also seen the woman taking a rickshaw in the vicinity, but this statement has not been verified. The woman does not remember anything after leaving the dance hall in the hired car. The wound on her head is also suspicious. The doctor refused to specify the nature of the wound last night, saying that it was difficult to determine whether it was a bullet wound or a sharp object touched when she fell to the ground. It must be X-rayed before a decision can be made.</p>

<p>Kidnapped by Bandits Three and a Half Years Ago and Killed for Ransom</p>
<p>Received a Telegram from Tianjin the Day Before Yesterday Asking His Wife to Go and Identify the Body</p>
<p>The Yisheng Wheel, a regular passenger ship of the British-owned Jardine Matheson, which runs between Shanghai and Tianjin, and the comprador of the ship, Li Shanting, and Chen Zhuting, the Tianjin dock manager of Jardine, were kidnapped by bandits three years ago and extorted for a large sum of money. Chen Zhuting paid a ransom of 50,000 yuan, but was still killed for ransom. The body was only found after two years. At that time, Chen Zhuting's family found two locker keys in the deceased's belongings, which proved that it was indeed Chen's body. However, Li Shanting's body has been obtained by the bandits, but his remains are still missing. Li's family used an empty coffin to replace Li's clothes and hats for burial, and tried to find them. It has been three and a half years since the incident. Unexpectedly, a telegram suddenly arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, saying that Li Shanting's body had been found and asking Li's wife to go to Tianjin to identify it in person as soon as possible. The method of identification will also be based on the belongings he left behind. After Li's wife received the report, she took a boat to Tianjin yesterday to identify the body, and then handed it over to the Dingsheng Wheel to be transported to Shanghai for burial. It is also learned that the passengers on the Yisheng Wheel who were kidnapped are now in negotiations with the bandits to redeem their tickets. It is heard that the place of negotiation is still a certain seaport in Hainan.</p>

<p>The customer still instructed the driver, Wang Ading, to drive forward to Huangxing Road. He suddenly showed a pistol, subdued and stripped Wang, and robbed him of 30 yuan in cash, and drove him away immediately. After the robbers were far away, Wang Ading was shocked and reported to the Second Office of the Seventh District of the nearby Municipal Public Security Bureau. Because Huang and Lu belonged to the jurisdiction of the Fourth Office of the Fifth District, Wang was transferred to the Fourth Office of the Fifth District to study the details and inquire by telegram. Scouts were dispatched in all directions, but there was no trace. Until about 9 am yesterday morning, the Public Concession Tisiwei Road Police Station received a report from a Westerner that his home was on Tisiwei Road. At about 11:50 pm last night (the night before last), he witnessed a Xiang Sheng car on the corner of North Sichuan Road, Tisiwei Road, and Changchun Road, driven by someone who looked like a worker, parked and got off. This morning (that is, yesterday morning) at about 8 o'clock, when he went out from his residence, he saw the car abandoned on Changchun Road and became suspicious. He came to report, etc. The Chinese and Western detectives were sent to investigate and found that it was indeed the missing Xiang Sheng car. There was no one in the car, only a set of Xiang Sheng driving uniforms and a hat. They immediately telegraphed the Xiang Sheng car line to come and identify it. As for whether the car was used to commit a crime when it was robbed by the robbers, it is now under strict investigation.</p>

<p>Expelled Before Engagement</p>
<p>Accused Again of Enticement</p>
<p>Xu Jinsheng of Yuyao, residing at No. 20 Xinhe Lane, Yishan Road, has a daughter named Fengmei, currently only nineteen years old. Two years ago, when the Xu family lived at Qidaitou, Longjiang Road, Fengmei was only seventeen and still a young, unmarried girl. Their neighbor, Hu Yougen, was ten years older than Fengmei and did not engage in proper work, thus remaining unmarried. He frequently used suggestive language towards Fengmei, arbitrarily enticing her. Around the Lunar New Year of last year, Hu suddenly took the girl to the Great World amusement park one evening, and they did not return home together. Instead, they went to a small inn on Guangdong Road for a night of passion. From then on, the girl was repeatedly defiled, but fearing her father's reprimand, she kept it a secret. It wasn't until May that Xu Jinsheng discovered the truth. He confronted Hu, whose father and elder brothers argued that since the deed was done, publicizing it would damage both their reputations. Fortunately, one was yet to marry, and the other was waiting to be betrothed. They could marry promptly to form a family, fulfilling their mutual desires and saving face for both sides. They persuaded Xu to set aside his resentment and embrace the union. Xu, left with no choice, reluctantly agreed and urged the Hu family to quickly hire a matchmaker for an early engagement. However, Hu Yougen requested that Xu allow him to live with the daughter at her parental home as if he were marrying into the family. Xu couldn't bear to refuse, so Fengmei and Hu appeared to be a formal couple. Hu then took further steps, interfering in Xu's household affairs and constantly demanding money from Fengmei for his own extravagance. The girl, who worked at a sock factory, had her savings entirely depleted. On June 13th of this year, Fengmei gave birth to a daughter. Hu not only showed no affection but grew increasingly disgusted with his unmarried wife, neglecting the marriage arrangements. The Xu family, father and daughter, deeply resented the cuckoo's occupation of their nest and felt that Hu's temperament was violent and increasingly depraved, associating only with idlers. The outcome would inevitably be dire. Fortunately, they had not formally engaged, making it easy to banish him from their home. Therefore, they issued a strict order for him to leave and hired a lawyer to sue Hu in the First Special District Local Court for enticing a minor, seeking punishment according to Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan held a hearing. Due to the case's content being related to public morals, the court had to prohibit spectators. Judge Zhan dismissed all spectators from the courtroom before questioning both parties individually. The result was that he advised both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court. If reconciliation failed, a continued hearing would be scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Municipal Guoshu (National Martial Arts) Hall Welcomes Guoshu Expert Zhang Xuebin <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xuebin is from Sichuan. From a young age, he was taught by extraordinary individuals, learning Guoshu techniques deep in remote mountains and valleys. After more than ten years of rigorous training, he mastered both soft and hard skills, especially the unique feat of setting up a Lei Tai (fighting platform) on Plum Blossom Poles. This time, he has come to Shanghai at the invitation of old friends and various organizations to demonstrate his Plum Blossom Pole skills and set up a Lei Tai to find like-minded individuals, adding a special touch to the Guoshu community.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local Guoshu Hall held a meeting to welcome Mr. Zhang. At 3 p.m., when Mr. Zhang arrived at the Guoshu Hall, the teachers and students had already gathered to welcome him. They exchanged greetings and expressions of admiration. After tea and refreshments, they were led to the Guoshu training ground behind the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. First, the students of the hall performed the Five Elements Sword, Broadsword, and Boxing techniques. Then, Mr. Tong Zhongyi, director of the Shaolin School, performed the Eight Immortals Sword and Double Halberds, with agile movements and steady techniques, demonstrating deep skill. Others, such as Instructor Jin Yunting with Xingyi Bagua, Instructor Zhao Shouchun with Taijiquan, Instructor Ma Wanlong with Shaolin Boxing, Instructor Liu Yunxiang with Shaolin Wrestling, Instructor Wang Zhenzhang with Shaolin Wrestling, Instructor Ma Hanzhang with Shaolin Boxing, and Instructor Yang Xiaowen with Taijiquan, were as nimble as monkeys and as fierce as angry tigers, balancing strength and gentleness, each with unique skills and dazzling performances, exciting the audience. After the Guoshu Hall's teachers and students finished their performances, Mr. Zhang was invited to continue with his first demonstration, the Luohan Fist. According to experts, this fist is not just any Shaolin technique. One must have deep understanding and exquisite skill to master it. When he gathered his Qi, his joints audibly cracked. From beginning to end, his hands and feet worked together, his movements swift and powerful. The second demonstration was the Double Sabers, named "Fierce Tiger Descending the Mountain." He placed the double sabers on the ground, leaped forward, supported by hands, raised both legs to form a 30-degree angle, and then flipped over, suddenly leaping up. Without lightness techniques, it would be impossible to achieve this. Afterward, the double sabers moved up and down with such fierce energy that only the blade light was visible, flashing incessantly. The audience was amazed. The third demonstration was the Single Saber, named "Eight Realities Saber." As it rotated, the blade created a sound like a tiger's roar. It was stopped short for fear the bending blade might break and injure the viewers. A complete show would have been preferred. The fourth demonstration was an internal Qi circulation technique. When he gathered his Qi, his body became like iron and stone, unharmed even by sharp knives or spears. He could even channel the Qi into others. After receiving this Qi, people who normally could not lift a chicken suddenly became impervious to knives and spears. This was proven on the spot and was not an exaggeration. Those present almost believed a deity had descended. To attain this internal Qi circulation, one must master both the Golden Bell Cover and Iron Shirt techniques to become as hard as iron and stone. Normally, the Qi is passed through the mouth. Mr. Zhang was able to channel it through his palm and transfer it to others, seemingly taking his mastery beyond the two advanced arts of iron and gold, an unbelievable skill that amazed everyone. After the performances, they returned to the hall. It was already 6 p.m. The guests and host shook hands and parted. Mr. Zhang's performance of the Plum Blossom Poles and Lei Tai in the Great World amusement park is drawing near. At that time, people in Shanghai will surely see something they have never seen before and be greatly entertained. Haig Road will be bustling with activity.</p>

<p>Advocating for Generous Compensation for the Deceased and Strict Punishment for the Culprit</p>
<p>The Remains Were Placed in a Coffin Yesterday at the China Funeral Home</p>
<p>Wu Yongmei, a female student from the Education Department of National Jinda University in Zhenru, was hit by a car with fellow students Hua Shuxian and Ouyang Shuxing on the 20th of this month while passing in front of the school. She was rushed to Southeast Hospital, but the doctor said her injuries were too severe to be saved. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Her remains were placed in a coffin at the China Funeral Home at 10 a.m. yesterday. The two injured women, Ouyang and others, are out of danger. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing a Support Association The students of the school, deeply saddened by the female student's excellent character and academic performance, as well as her amiable personality, whether they knew her or not, specially formed the Wu Case Support Association, advocating for generous compensation for the deceased, strict punishment for the culprit, and the erection of a stone monument for permanent remembrance. The details of the female student's death have been telegraphed to her family and a request made for someone to come to Shanghai to take care of matters. A reply has not yet been received. According to information gathered by reporters from the Guowen News Agency yesterday, the female student's biological parents are both deceased, and only a stepmother remains, with whom her relationship was not very harmonious. Her being alone and orphaned is truly tragic.</p>
<p>Out of Danger The two female students, Ouyang Shuxian and Hua Shuxian, who were hit at the same time as the female student, suffered head injuries. Fortunately, they were not serious. They were taken to Southeast Hospital and, after careful treatment by the hospital's doctors, are now out of danger. They will be discharged from the hospital after half a month of rest. Their families and the teachers and students of Jinda University have been visiting them for days, but the two women sometimes feel dizzy, and too much conversation is detrimental to their injuries, so the doctors have generally refused visitors. The culprit, Lan Fuming, who caused the accident, was originally an expelled student from Jinda University. He was returning to Shanghai from his honeymoon in Nanyang, driving his own car, and accidentally caused the accident. He is still being held in the Local Court. It is reported that the Jinda University authorities will file a lawsuit with the court in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Sun Fuxian's Discussion on Improving Tea Production <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association recently received a statement from member Sun Fuxian, claiming that our country's tea has long been famous and popular throughout the world. The six counties under the jurisdiction of Huizhou in Anhui Province, as well as Lu'an and Huoqiu counties, are famous for tea production. The livelihoods of the farmers in these counties depend on it, which is of great importance to our country's economic foundation. The tea produced in Taiping County, which belongs to the former Ningguo Prefecture, has the best aroma. According to the tea price ratio of each county, the annual output value of the county is about 2 million yuan. However, tea farmers stick to old methods and do not know how to improve. Moreover, due to inconvenient transportation, it is only sold along the Yangtze River, not exported, resulting in oversupply and blocked sales, causing farmers and merchants to suffer, and rural bankruptcy, which is regrettable. In addition, this year, the county suffered a severe drought, and food is scarce, which has caused panic. Fortunately, the Yintun Highway has been built to Taiping, and more than 10,000 farmers have gone to work and find food, which can temporarily save the current situation. However, winter is approaching, and the farmers in the countryside who have no clothes or food, how can they bear it? I have always had the ambition to improve Taiping tea and increase production to benefit the countryside. Now, tea merchants from the county have sent representatives to contact various places and petition the government to find ways to rescue them, and to request that farmers' banks and other banks set up branches in Taiping to help tea farmers and maintain production. (The completion of the Yintun Highway will allow Taiping tea to be transported directly to Shanghai via Tunxi for export) to consolidate the foundation of the rural base, etc. Comrade Sun has deep experience in the tea business and is currently the Shanghai business director of the Chizhou Baolong Coal Mine Company. In addition to the above tasks, he also plans to promote the sales of white coal from the mine. After the coal samples arrive in Shanghai, they will be sent to the association and distributed to major factories for trial combustion.</p>

Special guests included Zhong Yuliang, Ding Rusong, Yin Yucun, and Zhang Bingrui. The meeting was chaired by Director-General Wang Kuiheng and recorded by Zhong Tianshi. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting: "Today, we have invited you for two reasons. First, we are the staff of the Rural Improvement Association and should first understand the situation in the countryside. The entire rural area of ​​the district is very wide, and it is not easy to know everything at once. Therefore, we invite you to tell us about the situation in your respective districts. Second, the management of rural improvement cannot be successful by only a few people, so we need a lot of help from the landlords. Now we must first recognize and connect emotions. As for the affairs of rural improvement, there are thousands of threads, but only one can be done at a time. The most needed thing at present is to increase the income of farmers, so that a boat of idle youths who do not do their jobs can be gathered together and receive training in relevant production skills. On the one hand, they can find a way out for their own future, and on the other hand, they will not harm the local area. There are also children in the countryside who cannot attend school due to various reasons. We should also think of ways to give them the opportunity to be educated. Finally, there is one point that I must make clear to you, that is, this association is not a government office. All events are hoped to be resolved through peaceful and persuasive methods, mutual cooperation, and absolutely no nature of coercion or oppression. A district-wide survey will be conducted recently, and I hope you will explain it to the public in detail to avoid misunderstandings." Next, Mr. Zhong Yuliang, a member of the municipal government of the district and a director of the association, gave a speech, roughly saying that the Rural Improvement Association was founded by Mr. Du Yuesheng of this town with his own funds. Mr. Du is seeking happiness for his hometown, and you should also be enthusiastic and helpful. Only by solving the difficulties of farmers will we not solicit a single penny or cent of donations from the local area. This point must be explained to the public and vigorously promoted. Then, Mr. Yin Yucun, a respected person in the area, gave a speech, roughly saying that the Rural Improvement Association is not being held elsewhere, but is being held in Gaoqiao. This is really the happiness and honor of the Gaoqiao people. Several gentlemen in the association are mostly outsiders and are not familiar with the local situation. In order to avoid gaps in doing things, we have specially invited you to tell us about the situation in your respective districts today. At the same time, we will need your help in the future. I hope that Gaoqiao will be well managed and then promoted to various places, so that the country will naturally become strong. There is one more point. Smoking and gambling are great harms to the country. The government has failed to prohibit them for many years, and they are very popular in rural areas. I hope the Improvement Association will find appropriate methods to help the administrative authorities in banning them. After the speech, the chairman asked everyone to report on the number of households in the villages under their jurisdiction and their locations. The staff of the office then prepared wontons, and they talked and ate, ending in a joyous departure. The meeting ended at half past four.</p>

<p>Directed by Dong Shoujing from Zhejiang</p>
<p>Performed at the Great World</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Shoujing from Zhejiang spent his entire life training fleas to perform circus acts. He traveled around various countries and was highly praised by foreigners. Although a small skill, it is truly a spectacle. Mr. Dong can speak fluent English and humorous Mandarin, manipulating tiny insects in his palm. The equipment is also very scientific. Under a microscope, one can see the fleas performing various tricks, such as pulling a cart weighing two thousand times their own weight, kicking a ball weighing five times their own weight, jumping through colorful clothes, dragging a wheel weighing five thousand times their own weight, and incredibly agile hoop jumping. The performances are skilled and the movements are agile. They are now performing at the Great World. Those in Shanghai who want to feast their eyes can go and see it.</p>

<h3 id="e177">On the Theme of Creation <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>| Reply to Wu Li Jun |</p>
<p>(What should I write?)</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hu's letter, whenever he picks up a pen, he always asks himself this question and feels like there is nothing to write.</p>
<p>This is a matter of the theme of creation. All beginners in writing will encounter such difficulties: sometimes there are a thousand and one things, but no way to start, because they don't know how to choose and organize the theme of creation; sometimes, the belly is empty, there is nothing to write, also because they don't know how to recognize the theme of creation. Once the theme problem is solved, the situation of a "frozen pen" will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>What is the theme of creation? Simply put, the theme is the backbone of the article. For a house, the beams are the theme of the house. In literary terms, the theme is the reality expressed in the work, the central issue depicted. There is a difference between theme and material (subject matter). Various phenomena in society, when they have not happened in relation to the author, existing objectively and independently, are called subject matter. Once they are subjectively selected, organized, and written into a work by the author, then it is not a simple subject matter but a theme. For example, a drought. The objective fact of a drought, we can only say that it is a great subject matter for current creation, because when it exists independently before being recognized by the author, it is only a phenomenon, and it is unknown whether it will be written into a work by the author. However, once recognized by the author, written into a work, and organized into a systematic story, exposing its reality as much as possible, then the drought becomes the theme of that work.

<h3 id="e178">Recording Proverbs <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>In various local dialects, I think the most wonderful parts are the four types of: nursery rhymes, proverbs, riddles, and puns. Nursery rhymes include children's songs, proverbs and riddles need no explanation, and puns include tongue twisters and drinking games.</p>
<p>For now, let's just take proverbs as an example.</p>
<p>Proverbs are aphorisms in spoken language, and are often used as maxims in spoken language. Guo Shaoyu said in (A Study of Proverbs):</p>
<p>A proverb is the result of a person's practical experience, expressed in beautiful words, which can be used openly in daily conversation, and is a formula for regulating human behavior.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo's definition of proverb is very correct. In modern times, the study of proverbs seems to have started with him; the recording of proverbs, as individual pamphlets, I have only seen Ye Dejun's Collection of Huai'an Proverbs.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's collection of proverbs is a very thin book, with 275 proverbs, 44 agricultural proverbs, and 200 tongue twisters. Of course, the author's attention is limited to one township and one county, and the individual's listening is limited, and what he can remember is also limited. It is already very difficult to achieve such results.</p>
<p>I remember when I first entered middle school, I saw a book called "Yi Fa Tong" (One Method Through), the author was Wu Xie from Linxiang. Speaking of Wu Xie, he was a famous person in Hunan, he was an old celebrity. It is said that when Division Commander Wu Ziyu was stationed in Yuezhou, he knew that this old celebrity was very poor, and gave him several hundred yuan. I don't know if it was the division commander's subordinates, or the straggling northern soldiers, who heard that the old celebrity actually had a large sum of money one day, went to his home to (initiate), scaring the old celebrity who was over seventy years old to death. Now, what makes a few people in Hunan remember this old celebrity is the book called "Yi Fa Tong".</p>
<p>What kind of book is "Yi Fa Tong" written by Mr. Wu Fengsun?</p>
<p>I have read this book, it has two volumes, upper and lower. The author arranges the ancient and modern proverbs according to the order of the poetic rhymes, starting from three-character phrases, and ending with many phrases, similar to the form of (Sound and Rhythm Enlightenment). Therefore, the book is named (Yi Fa Tong), because the first chapter is in the "Dong" rhyme, and the first sentence is (One method through, all methods through). This book is very popular in the area around Yueyang Linxiang, the hometown of Mr. Wu. I think it can still be bought now. This is a work that has contributed to folklore studies since Yang Shen's Ancient and Modern Proverbs, etc. It is a pity that I don't have this book on hand now, so I can't give a detailed introduction. If someone can buy this book for me, I would be overjoyed!</p>
<p>In the eighth volume of Zhu Mu Xiang's Mingzhai Xiaoshi of the Qing Dynasty, there is a (Wu Xia Proverbs Couplet) entry, saying that Wang Guan, a commoner of the state of Wu, had many feelings, and later in his old age, he compiled four volumes of Wu Xia Proverbs Couplets, many of which are well-made and clever. Five-character phrases such as | | |</p>
<p>Catching lice on a tiger's head, gold-plated stone eggs,</p>
<p>Digging loach out of a cat's mouth. Blackened paper lantern.</p>
<p>Zhong Kui catching little ghosts, god of the latrine before the pit,</p>
<p>Luo Han inviting Amitabha. Local gentry on the platform.</p>
<p>Eyes hungry, stomach empty, heating loach in a pen tube,</p>
<p>Tough mouth, brittle bones. Feeling for clams under the bed.</p>
<p>Hot air replacing cold air, eyes red and hopeful,</p>
<p>Big insects bullying small insects. White intestines.</p>
<p>Seven-character phrases such as | |</p>
<p>Burdening the neighbors to eat thin porridge,</p>
<p>Instigating the master to heat the casserole.</p>
<p>Threading somersaults through copper coin eyes,</p>
<p>Performing rituals in a snail shell.</p>
<p>Sheep go to eat grass, geese go to chase,</p>
<p>Chickens come to collect debts, ducks worry.</p>
<p>East hand receiving money, west hand sending it away,</p>
<p>South sky raining, north sky clear.</p>
<p>Female chickens, male ducks, short head cloth,</p>
<p>Sharp knife, hot water, dry towel.</p>
<p>Eight-character and ten-character phrases such as | |</p>
<p>Little children eat radishes, peeling them piece by piece;</p>
<p>Monks have no hair, happy to shave.</p>
<p>Mothers want to marry, the sky wants to rain,</p>
<p>The rich don't teach, the poor don't study.</p>
<p>Adopting a daughter-in-law, employing a matchmaker, is also difficult to guarantee;</p>
<p>Old monks watching dog fights, I am not as good as him.</p>
<p>Nine-character phrases such as | |</p>
<p>Old gods of longevity eating arsenic, tired of living;</p>
<p>King Yama opening a restaurant, ghosts don't come.</p>
<p>Only caring about sheep's testicles, not caring about sheep's life;</p>
<p>Only seeing sheep drinking water, not seeing sheep urinating.</p>
<p>This Wu Xia Proverbs Couplet, although well-organized and clever, I think it is inevitable that the original words of the proverbs are changed to suit the antithetical parts. Compiling up to four volumes, one cannot but admire his willingness to spend so much effort, although he only sees it as a game, a pastime. But I don't know if this book has a printed edition? If there is no printed edition, I don't know if his descendants or other bibliophiles have a manuscript? This is a very useful book in folklore studies, which can be combined with Wu Xie's Yi Fa Tong and printed together.</p>
<p>Some people say that there are too few vocabularies in vernacular Chinese, and the diction is not enough. You have to find it in books such as Literary Selections, etc. Everyone knows that this is unnecessary.</p>
<p>In reality, if we are willing to write articles in a spoken and written language that is close to the public, apart from the need to use foreign words and newly created words, sometimes we must also borrow a few simple words, and try to find vocabularies and diction from the living languages ​​popular in the folk, which is even more necessary. Therefore, I hope that people from all over the world can spare a little time and put in a little effort to record the proverbs of their hometowns in the best way they think possible. This is also part of our practice of material work.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Impressions of Changsha <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Lin San</p>
<p>The people of Changsha are capable of anything. For example, if a woman walks down the street without socks or with her chest exposed, many idle people will scold her as a "witch," "foreign woman," or "traitor." If they are more serious, they will even throw stones at her. If a young couple walks side by side (note that you absolutely cannot find Chinese men and women walking arm-in-arm in Changsha), everyone will focus their attention on them, make faces to shame them, and a large group of idlers will follow behind, scolding: "Shameless ugly things!" "Ugly ghosts!" "Where did these monsters come from!"</p>
<p>A classmate and her husband had just returned from France. Because they didn't have Chinese clothes, they wore Western suits and high heels when they walked on the street. As a result, they were scolded so much that she barely dared to go out and hurriedly bought cloth to rush to make cheongsams. I asked her, "Have you been hit by stones?" "Fortunately, I haven't been hit yet, but I've been scolded enough!" she said, shaking her head as if she couldn't believe that such a phenomenon would occur in a traditionally civilized Changsha.</p>
<p>In fact, they can only show off in Changsha. If they go to Shanghai, Hankou, or Hong Kong, there are "witches" everywhere, and they can't be scolded enough. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>"It's that guy who conscripted soldiers!" Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, pretended to be experienced. It seemed like he had been reading this notice all night.</p>
<p>"Wasn't it posted a few days ago? Damn it!" Da Jiao Feng Muren sat on the wooden crossbar of the Cuizhu Pavilion, continuing.</p>
<p>"It was posted, but it was torn down! I don't know what turtle bastard did it!" Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, rarely used this rather classist curse (son of a bitch), but recently he has been in contact with the people in the yamen more and more, so he has learned a little. But he also added the local curse (turtle), omitting the word "egg".</p>
<p>"Tear it!" A young farmer, Daogou, shouted loudly. "What's the use of tearing it down? Who would do this dirty business?"</p>
<p>"Hmph! See if you don't go! See if you, Daogou, can hold out!" Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, stretched out his ginger-joint-like hand, pointing at Daogou. "Seventy-two conscripts in the whole village! The register has been prepared, with names on it. See if you don't go! See if you don't go!"</p>
<p>Shoufu Aidaibao watched from the side, stuck out his tongue, said "Heh!" and turned around, squatting on the stone platform at the entrance of the pavilion, holding his head.</p>
<p>"I didn't tell you to go!" Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, was quite eloquent, first clearing himself of any responsibility, and then he said a lot: "If you don't go, I'm even happier. Do we lack a big cannon like you in our village? But, I'm afraid things won't be so easy. The words from above have already been spoken, and we have to do it. Since we have to do it, those with names will have to go."</p>
<p>"Hmph!" Kaiyang Mapizi didn't believe it. "What's the use of opening the list of names? We don't have words carved on our foreheads! As long as the people in the village keep their mouths shut and don't say who is who, see who he calls to go."</p>
<p>This reasoning was valid, and everyone in the entire pavilion laughed "Hehe!". Several rays of light immediately appeared on their faces.</p>
<p>Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, seemed to be stumped. He had nothing to say. Then Daogou, the young man, cursed: "Only dogs bite people, whoever bites out who is a dog."</p>
<p>As he cursed, everyone's eyes swept to Dong Sheng, the lame-handed. Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, immediately understood that he was a village policeman. Damn it, being a village policeman is really not a job for humans! If I have a job, I will never do this shitty job!</p>
<p>Under the attack of all eyes, Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, to avoid it, looked through the pavilion and towards the street. He happened to see the sign outside Maolong Store.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Hmph!" Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, immediately raised his throat. "See if you don't go! See if you don't go! If no one says it, you still have to go. You just need to look at this thing." Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, raised the hand that wasn't lame, straightened his middle finger, and pointed towards Maolong Store. Standing outside Maolong Store at this moment was A Zhao, a (conscript). A Zhao saw Dong Sheng, the lame-handed, pointing at him, and thought something was wrong, so he walked over. Looking at A Zhao's dejected appearance, it seemed that he had had a fight with someone.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Wonders of the Deep Sea <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Of the parts of the earth with life, the seabed is the least known to people. Our knowledge of deep-sea life comes entirely from specimens of several kinds of fish, all of which were caught in nets after they died.</p>
<p>Dr. Pi Bai, director of the scientific research department of the New York Zoological Society, in order to explore knowledge of deep-sea life, used a new method of submersion many times in 1930 and 1932. With the technical assistance of Barton, he made a two-ton steel ball. This ball is airtight on all sides and equipped with small windows made of fused silica, through which you can see everything in the water. He and Barton sat in the ball and submerged in the deep sea outside Bermuda (between the West Indies and Newfoundland) nearly twenty times, reaching a depth of 2,200 feet, which is the deepest point in the sea reached by living people. This summer, he received a large donation from the National Geographic Society of Washington and will continue his observation of deep-sea life.</p>
<p>Each time they submerged, a large cargo ship first carried the steel ball to the vast ocean, and then slowly lowered the ball. Inside the ball was a powerful searchlight that constantly emitted white light, illuminating the strange depths of the ocean transparently. At this time, many bulb-shaped phosphorescent strange fish, attracted by the light, swam through the light like weaving shuttles. Dr. Pi Bai's face was close to the window, and he briefly narrated everything he saw to the telephone. On the deck of the cargo ship sat a stenographer, with a telephone receiver on his ear and a notebook in his hand, recording Dr. Pi Bai's words in shorthand.</p>
<p>The outer shell of the ball is made of 1.5-inch-thick fine steel, and inside are placed measuring instruments, thermometers, and other scientific instruments. It is also equipped with several oxygen tanks, because air cannot be drawn from the surface to the depth reached by the submersible. Each tank has an automatic mechanism that releases two liters of oxygen per minute. There are also two wire racks, one with calcium chloride, which is used to absorb moisture, and one with soda lime, which is used to remove excess carbon dioxide in the air. When the ball reaches the deep sea, the people in the ball rely on slightly high-pressure air to survive. This summer, several new windows made of fused silica, three inches wide and eight inches long, were installed. Fused silica is the strongest and most transparent material in the world, capable of resisting extremely high underwater pressure.</p>
<p>The ball has a small door for people to enter and exit, weighing 400 pounds. When entering the ball, you have to climb over the crossbar, which is very troublesome. Then lift the door, put it into the groove, tighten it with screws, and then tighten it with an iron hammer. The sound almost deafens the people in the ball. It is even more difficult when exiting the ball. Although Dr. Pi Bai is an experienced adventurer, he always looks pale when exiting the ball each time.</p>
<p>After everything is arranged properly, the ball is lifted from the deck with a powerful crane, moved to the side of the ship, and slowly lowered into the sea. The momentum of the ball and the length of time in the water are all directed by the telephone in the ball. Once the ball is parked at a certain depth, the people in the ball begin to observe.</p>
<p>As the ball descends to the bottom of the sea, the light in the water gradually decreases, and the water pressure gradually increases. In the blink of an eye, it passes through the pure blue floating fish layer and enters a semi-bright and semi-dark area, where everything can be seen. Descending further, it becomes as dark as ink, and the ball stops. At this time, it is half a mile deep from the surface of the sea. The water here is very cold, almost motionless, and the water pressure is extremely high, so the fish obtained from this depth often burst when they reach the surface of the water.</p>
<p>Dr. Pi Bai once said: "The deep blue that appears in the deepest part of this ocean is indescribable. It is completely different from everything I have seen in the upper world, and it confuses our optic nerves to the extreme. We think about it all the time, and we always call it brilliant. I picked up a book to read many times, but I only felt that there was no difference between blank pages and colored plates."</p>
<p>Dr. Pi Bai submerged many times and saw many fish with light-emitting and flashing organs. The eyes of these fish are very sharp and can swim freely in the dark. Dr. Pi Bai saw clusters of bright light moving slowly in the water in the ball. There were also some that jumped very fast. He used a searchlight to illuminate them and saw that they were all long, hatchetfish with glittering bodies. When they swam through the light of the searchlight, the light on their bodies disappeared, and when they came out of the light, they were bright again. Some of the fish were completely black, some were completely red, and the light came from their heads, gills, and tails. Some came from both sides of their bodies, like a ship with lights on in the dark night, with bright light shining out from the small round portholes on the side of the ship. The colors of the light were different, some were dark red, some were yellow, and some were light purple. Some glowed permanently, and some glowed intermittently, like the light advertisements in a theater. Once, Dr. Pi Bai used a searchlight to illuminate all around and found that there were many extremely small creatures in two areas, separated by a wide section, but there were very few in between.</p>
<p>In 1932, the doctor descended many times in shallow water, and the ball rose and fell among the coral reefs until the ball frame fell into deep water. Once, a sharp piece of coral rock was horizontal under the surface of the water, blocking the ball. Fortunately, the cargo ship above quickly reeled in the cable, otherwise the steel cable tied to the ball would be wrapped around the sharp coral rock, and it would suddenly break. Then, with a loud crash, the ball would fall into the sea like a hard-shelled fruit falling from a tree branch. Dr. Pi Bai's submersion can be called a great discovery in modern science. In the future, it may be possible to find out how the coral and fish in the water become the coral and fish in the middle layer of the water, and descending further, how the coral disappears and the fish become deep-water shapes. Oceanographers now know nothing about these changes, because the changing areas are uneven and cannot be netted, so there is no thorough method of inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Overseas Chinese Xu Chengji Retains the Java Tennis Championship <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Defeats Japanese Oie Two to One</p>
<p>Runner-up in Doubles with Lin Xuyin</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent from Batavia) Mr. Xu Chengji, a tennis player representing our country at the Far Eastern Games in the Philippines this year, is an overseas Chinese from Java Island, Netherlands East Indies, in Southeast Asia. Mr. Xu has participated in many competitions in Beijing, Shanghai and other places in China. How his skills are, I think the compatriots in the motherland know very well, there is no need for the reporter to repeat it.</p>
<p>Beating Oie Xu returned from Shanghai and has been more active in tennis practice, and his progress has been quite rapid. At the beginning of this month, the Dutch Indian Tennis Association held the All-Java Championship in Bandung. Many Chinese people signed up to participate, and the situation was very lively. Xu Chengji won the championship in the competition last year, and of course he could not miss this opportunity this year, so he also participated. After several days of preliminary matches, Mr. Xu still overwhelmed the players. Yesterday (September 12th) was the final day. In the singles group, Mr. Xu and Japanese Oie competed for the final battle. Enemies meet, particularly clear-eyed. The intensity of this battle can be imagined. Therefore, even before the competition started, the tennis court was already full of spectators, especially overseas Chinese. However, Mr. Xu was unfortunately ill on that day, and the performance was not as brilliant as expected. However, the Japanese Oie was exceptionally stable. Except for the slightly weaker backhand, there were almost no flaws to attack. However, when the game reached ten to nine in the third set, Oie's strength began to fail, and his legs cramped, so he was forced to declare his abandonment. Therefore, the Java tennis championship this year was still won by Mr. Xu.</p>
<p>First Set As for the battle situation, the reporter originally intended to omit it, but in order to satisfy the general tennis fans in the motherland, I have to describe it below. It was found that the strategies of both sides on that day rarely used high lobs. Most of the balls they hit were both low and fast. Xu's smashes, volleys and drop shots, although in his physical discomfort, still did not lose the original color of the year. Cheers rose from the four seats from time to time. Xu's serve was not fierce this time, and Oie was generally able to hit it back. After the start of the second set, Xu immediately won a game, followed by Oie, creating a draw. Xu then took the lead with two to one. Oie also immediately caught up, and then pumped up his energy to win the first set with two to six. This was quite unexpected.</p>
<p>Second Set The first game of the second set still belonged to Mr. Xu, but the second game was won by Oie, and he continued to lose three levels in a row, creating an advantage of one to four. When Xu saw that the situation was about to collapse, he began to shake his arms and roll up his sleeves, and responded with determination, gaining an evenly matched situation. Unexpectedly, the ninth game was owned by Oie again, and there was a danger of being ended by him with four to six. Fortunately, Xu did not disappoint the expectations of the audience, and chased another game, making the score five to five. Then Mr. Xu used angled balls and backline shots, and finally won two games in a row, winning with seven to five. The frowning faces of the general audience were like wind sweeping away the clouds, gone in a roll.</p>
<p>Third Set After the third set continued, Mr. Xu began to gain the encouragement of the audience, and his spirit increased greatly. Under heavy pressure and light lobs, he took three games, and then Oie regained one game. Mr. Xu still had the upper hand, and the number of games rose from three to one, four to two, five to twenty. At this point, the general audience all believed that the final victory had been repeatedly promised to Mr. Xu, but the matter was completely wrong. Because Xu accidentally lost a ball, Oie's courage suddenly increased a hundredfold, and he finally created a draw of five to five. This is what makes people feel sorry for. However, after this, Xu always had the upper hand, and Oie did not show weakness, following closely step by step, until after the number of ten to nine games, Oie finally collapsed and was defeated.</p>
<p>As for the men's doubles, Xu Chengji and Lin Xuyin also participated, but they were defeated by Suma et al. and Shabu Yue, and only won the runner-up. (Published on September 13th)</p>

<p>Fewer Than Three Schools Participating Will Not Be Considered a Championship</p>
<p>Methods Will Be Devised to Hold Current Games That Popularize General Sports</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Universities Sports Association held an executive committee meeting at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on the morning of the day before yesterday (23rd). Representatives from six schools—Central, Jinling, Fudan, Chizhi, Guanghua, and Jinan—attended. Guanghua's Rong Qiguang, chairman, discussed the details of this year's competitions among the schools. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Important Resolutions Resolved: The following important resolutions were resolved at this executive committee meeting: (1) If three or more schools participate in a competition, it will be considered a championship. If fewer than three schools participate, it will be considered an exhibition. (2) The tennis competition venue is set for Nanjing Jinling, with the date after October 15th. (3) The all-around cross-country competition venue will be at Chizhi. (4) The number of competitions that each school's athletes can participate in per day will still be limited to four, with the all-around and track and field competitions combined as one item for calculation (previously, it was counted as two items). (5) The football competition date remains in November to December.</p>
<p>Popularizing Sports The executive committee also held an informal discussion on the widespread development of sports in the Jiangnan universities. The executive committee members believed that the Jiangnan University Sports Association should not only focus on competitions for athletes from each school but should also pay attention to the development of general sports. Therefore, it was decided that each Jiangnan University should select more than a hundred students to participate in track and field or other competitions, and the average score of each school would be calculated to determine the rankings. However, this matter has not yet been officially decided.</p>
<p>Member Withdrawal The association finally exchanged views on member withdrawals. The committee members all believed that the withdrawal of a member should be done through a formal letter from the president of the representative school and with proper procedures. The general meeting must permit the withdrawal. Any other form of withdrawal will not be considered official.</p>

<p>However, in the past three or four years, the government has strictly carried out mergers and closures of universities that were poorly managed, and has imposed strict conditions for the establishment and re-establishment of new universities. The previous abuses of extravagance have been slightly corrected. As for emphasizing practical subjects, various measures have been established in recent years (such as limiting the ratio of enrollment in liberal arts and practical science subjects in various schools). As a result, the orientation of schools and students has greatly changed (when several universities conducted entrance exams this summer, the number of students applying for liberal arts subjects was far less than the number applying for practical science subjects). In addition, for the past two years, the funding for national universities has not been reduced, and the equipment and administrative discipline of universities have also improved. Therefore, in the current situation, schools above the national vocational level are indeed entering a normal track. The current problems are: first, expanding the equipment of various schools, especially the equipment in the field of practical science; second, increasing the number of excellent university teachers. Currently, most universities feel the lack of excellent teachers, and domestic universities are still unable to cultivate university teachers due to the lack of research institutes. Therefore, the current policy should continue the policy of studying abroad and select suitable universities to prepare for the establishment of research institutes. Third, ensuring the stability of funding for public schools and providing relief to private schools with excellent performance. In addition, in order to encourage young students to improve and improve the academic atmosphere, the examination and appointment system must be universally implemented. Otherwise, the results of the school will be disconnected from the future of the youth, the political atmosphere will not be easy to improve, and the academic atmosphere will not be easy to improve.</p>
<p>Second, the status of secondary education: In the current education system, secondary education includes three types of secondary schools, namely ordinary middle schools (junior high and senior high), normal schools, and vocational schools. Since the Republic of China, the progress of public and private secondary schools across the country can be seen from the following figures in terms of quantity:</p>
<p>(A) Number of Schools</p>
<p>Number of middle schools in the first year of the Republic of China: 373</p>
<p>Number of middle schools in the 20th year of the Republic of China: 1892 (increased five times)</p>
<p>Number of three types of schools, middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools: 3021</p>
<p>(B) Number of Students</p>
<p>Number of middle school students in the first year of the Republic of China: 52,100</p>
<p>Number of middle school students in the 20th year of the Republic of China: 403,134</p>
<p>(Approximately 8 times increase)</p>
<p>Number of middle school, normal school, and vocational school students: 537,757</p>
<p>(C) Amount of Funding</p>
<p>Amount of funding for middle schools in the first year of the Republic of China: 3,034,704 yuan</p>
<p>Amount of funding for middle schools in the 20th year of the Republic of China: 39,171,385 yuan</p>
<p>(13 times increase)</p>
<p>Amount of funding for middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools:</p>
<p>54,053,363</p>
<p>In terms of the content of secondary schools, there are indeed still many bad schools in various places, and the composition of such schools is particularly obvious in metropolitan areas with many schools. However, in the past three or four years, the curriculum standards of secondary schools have been set by the Ministry, and the levels of each school have a statutory standard. In addition, in the past two years, the middle school examination system has been universally enforced, and schools and students have gradually been unable to muddle through. The improvement of the school level of general middle schools in the future can be predicted. There are indeed many aspects of moral education in middle schools across the country that need to be improved, but the management of many middle schools is indeed perfect. The biggest weakness of secondary education at present is that the proportion of ordinary middle schools is particularly large, and the proportion of vocational schools is particularly small. According to statistics from the 20th year of the Republic of China, out of 3,000 secondary schools, ordinary middle schools accounted for more than 1,800 schools, normal schools accounted for more than 800 schools, and vocational schools only accounted for more than 200 schools. The total number of secondary school students is more than 500,000, of which vocational school students only account for about 40,000, less than one-tenth of the total number. How to correct this maldistribution is the biggest problem facing secondary education at present. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has instructed all provinces and cities to revise their budgets and redistribute secondary education funds in order to achieve a roughly equivalent state of funding for ordinary middle schools and vocational schools in all provinces and cities before the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Hankou, 24th) Director of the Department of Education Cheng Qibao was originally scheduled to go to Tianmen on the 24th to inspect local education. However, due to bad weather, he was unable to go. He will depart in about two or three days. In addition, the Department of Education originally planned to set up an agricultural school in Tianmen. Now, the General Headquarters has ordered the establishment of district-level agricultural schools in each district.

<p>The central government has approved an annual expenditure of 33,000 yuan for the educational subsidy for Mongolia, Tibet, and the Hui people in the 22nd year. It will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance on a monthly basis. The original budget included an item for other subsidies, totaling 10,200 yuan, explaining the subsidies for the Mongolian and Tibetan Xunbao News Agency, the Mongolian Future Monthly, the Kangzang Vanguard Monthly, and the Beiping Chengda Normal School. Now, the Mongolian and Tibetan Political Training Class receives 2,333 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen per month. The actual monthly office expenses are 319 yuan. Because the lecture notes for each subject are printed and distributed, the required paper and printing costs are very high, together with tea, lighting, oil, and various miscellaneous expenses, amounting to about 500 yuan. In addition, in order to promote communication of border information and student practical training, it is planned to publish a monthly magazine, which requires an additional 100 yuan per month. In total, there is a monthly shortfall of about 300 yuan. Now, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has approved a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan starting from January of this year, which will be allocated from other subsidies. However, since this subsidy was not listed in the original plan, the auditing agencies will have no basis for the reimbursement of the class in the future. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has submitted the case to the central government for approval. It was notified to the Auditing Department and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission by the Executive Yuan yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Central Book and Magazine Review Committee Works Tightly <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News) Since its establishment in Shanghai, the Central Book and Magazine Review Committee has reviewed more than 500 kinds of magazines and books in four months. On average, each staff member reviews more than 100,000 words per day. The review procedures are exceptionally fast. Even for huge works, it takes no more than two days. Therefore, the publishing industry generally believes that the speed is unexpectedly fast, which provides a lot of convenience. As for the review standards of the committee, unless the words are absolutely and obviously unfavorable to the party and the government, they are asked to delete and change them. The rest are based on impartiality and impartiality, without any partiality. Therefore, in recent months, everything has been fine. In the past, the publishing industry was often subject to detention or prohibition after the publication of books due to the lack of a review agency. Since the establishment of the review committee, this kind of event has no longer occurred. It is heard from the central government that the committee has achieved excellent work results, and the publishing industry urgently needs this kind of organization. There are plans to increase the number of internal staff in order to facilitate the review work.</p>

<p>The academic lecture organized by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau was originally scheduled to be held publicly at the Huzhou Guildhall on Guizhou Road this Sunday (September 23rd).

<p>Since Mr. Wei Daoming became the principal of Shanghai Law and Political Science College in Dapuqiao, this city, the school affairs have been actively improved in all aspects, and the atmosphere has been renewed. Yesterday, the school held a memorial week. In addition to more than 300 students, the faculty included Principal Wei Daoming, Dean of Academic Affairs Gong Xiang, Dean of Students Chen Jilie, Head of the Law Department Jiang Zhensan, and more than 20 others. After the ceremony, Chairman Wei reported on the progress of the recent board of directors meeting, the school's improvement plan after the meeting, and the points that students should pay attention to, in great detail. His words were very cautionary, and everyone who heard them was moved. The speech lasted for more than an hour. The main points were that the most urgent task of the college at present is not only material construction, but also spiritual construction. Most students studying law and political science believe that this subject can not only lead to officialdom and wealth, but is also easier to handle than other subjects. This kind of self-deceiving and misleading mentality is actually very harmful. Moreover, most young people nowadays engage in meaningless activities in school and are unwilling to enrich their knowledge, making it difficult for them to establish themselves in society. Therefore, the college should pay special attention to the spiritual aspects in the future, practice strict principles, so that students will not only not have the idea of ​​rising to officialdom and getting rich when they enter society in the future, but will also be able to seek welfare for the country and the people.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Haining Tide and Haining Disaster <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Duansheng</p>
<p>Tides are common to all oceans. Why do people go to Haining to watch the tide in groups, especially in special trains? It is precisely because the tide in Haining is different from the tide in general oceans and does have a value worth seeing. The tide comes from the East China Sea. Once it enters Haining, it rises like a silver wall, galloping like ten thousand horses, horizontally in a line, rolling and surging, overturning rivers and seas, worthy of the four characters "majestic, magnificent, strange, and frightening" without shame. Therefore, the Haining tide is unique in the world and famous at home and abroad. It is a must-see.</p>
<p>Since the tide in Haining is so powerful, the people who live in Haining often worry that the tide will cross the dike and flood into the interior, lamenting "its fish". Unexpectedly, this year's drought did not turn them into "fish in a dry rut". Is this really a great misfortune for the people of Haining?</p>
<p>I remember that among the three prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, the great drought in the modern era occurred once in the 19th year of Jiaqing, which was also the year of Jiaxu, exactly two cycles of the sixty-year cycle ago, just one hundred and twenty years ago, and the disaster was also very severe. Another time was the great drought in the 6th year of Xianfeng (Bingchen). It is said that there was yellow plum rain in that year, but the drought started in mid-June, and it has been seventy-nine years since then. Although there were other days when the "riverbed faced the sky", they were very brief. Unlike this year's drought, the heat has exceeded previous records, and the time has been three months long. As soon as the plum season arrived, the drought began, and the disaster reached the point where there was no harvest. Perhaps it is a strange disaster that has never occurred since Haining existed!</p>
<p>Misfortunes never come singly. Haining could barely make a living, but unexpectedly, the silk market has declined in the past two years. The silk cocoons, which Haining people consider the "three spring can equal one winter" lifeline, are as cheap as cotton, and few people care about them. How can the people of Haining not be poor?</p>
<p>Only in the past ten days or so have there been several heavy rains. There is finally water in the rivers, but it cannot save the already dead rice. Ladies and gentlemen! If you see the disasters of Haining approaching, you should also shed a tear of sympathy!</p>
<h3 id="e218">Where Does the Tide Come From? <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Looking at the tide from books, they all say that it enters Biezimen and starts to sound like thunder. Otherwise, this is just an old saying. Biezimen is where the Qiantang River is divided into three mouths by the mountains of Kanze. The waterway between the mountains of Kan and the villages of Wentang and Hezhuang is called Daze; the waterway between the mountains of Wentang and Hezhuang and the Zeshan is called Zhongxiaze; and the waterway between Zeshan and the Haining Dike is called Beidaze. As of now, the mountains of Kanze have long been silted up into land, connecting with the south bank, dozens of miles away from the sea. The so-called Biezimen has become a historical relic. (It can also be said that Beidaze still exists.) However, its location is west of Haining, around Lao Yancang. Watching the tide is all in Haining, already outside Biezimen. It is absurd to say that the great tide is caused by the annual surge of Biezimen. However, it may as well be said that Biezimen is the place where the Qiantang River enters the sea. The west of it is the river; the east of it is the sea. Therefore, when speaking of the river, Biezimen can be cited, just like the Sanjia Water outside Wusongkou.</p>
<p>Then where does the tide come from? The tide comes from the East China Sea. The tide from the East China Sea is no different from the tide in general oceans. It passes through Zhapu, sweeps across Haiyan and Ganpu, and heads west. One only sees the waves surging and the water rising, but there is no magnificent sight of a giant thunderous silver wall standing high. When it enters Jianshan Pass, one begins to see white waves surging, connecting into a line, standing tall like a silver wall, crossing the river to the west, sounding like thunder, and forming a world wonder. From this, it can be known that the occurrence of the sea tide occurs at Jianshan Pass.</p>
<p>Why does Jianshan Pass create such a great tide? It is because the estuary extends northeast, wide on the outside and narrow on the inside. The tide enters from the northeast, vast and mighty; unexpectedly, the waterway becomes narrower and narrower as it progresses. Since the tide is bound by the terrain, it cannot stretch freely. The tide that heads straight for the south bank is also stirred up and heads north, meeting at the mouth of Jianshan. Moreover, the mouth of Jianshan is full of reefs, and the Tasha Dike also lies horizontally in the middle of the sea. The tide is stirred left and right, and the force becomes thicker and the momentum increases, so it surges high like a wall, and rushes west across the sea. The area around Babu is the most magnificent. When it reaches Nanmen in Haining, the force slackens slightly, and the crest of the tide is not very neat. When it reaches the old Biezimen and other places, the crest of the tide gradually flattens and is no longer worth seeing.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Qianlong Emperor and Haining <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Xinan</p>
<p>Regarding Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty, no matter north or south, there is a legend that he was "the son of Grand Secretary Chen of Haining", which has been around for a long time. What exactly happened, even if Emperor Gaozong were raised from the ground, he would not be willing to tell the truth. However, according to the elders, there seems to be some connection between Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty and the Chen family of Haining. Perhaps it is also a conjecture and rumor by later generations; however, there is also a lot of information that can be regarded as unofficial historical material. I will tell you all about it when I have the opportunity to use it for after-dinner conversation. At this moment, just talking about watching the tide, we will talk about Emperor Qianlong and Haining from the aspect of the tide.</p>
<p>When you go to the sea dike to watch the tide, you will see the majestic stone dike, stretching for dozens of miles, which is worth praising for its greatness. This sea dike is called the Fish Scale Dike. This dike can indeed be compared with the Fish Scale Register compiled by Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, which has the same name but different functions. One clarified the national land tax; the other protected the lives of the people of seven prefectures. How is this stone dike built? It is made of very long strips of stone, stacked horizontally and vertically, forming a stepped shape (like fish scales, hence the name). It is up to ten feet high. The strips of stone on the dike surface (i.e., where pedestrians walk) are then reinforced with iron ingots. The gaps between the stones are mostly filled with iron filings and smoothed to prevent erosion by the tide. At the bottom of the stone dike, wooden segments several feet long are hammered in to make it solid. Outside of it, a strip of stone about a foot wide is also built to ease the water flow, so as to strengthen the dike body. In places where the tide is urgent, two tiers of stone is constructed in order to protect the dike itself. Only with such a solid project can it resist the attack of the raging tide; however, the power of the tide is too great, and over time, it will still wash away a section of the stone dike. Therefore, in the Qing Dynasty, annual maintenance projects were highly valued.</p>
<p>Before the Qing Dynasty, Haining's dikes included both wooden dikes and stone dikes, but none of the stone dikes that have been preserved today existed. The current stone dike! The Fish Scale Dike was launched in the first year of Yongzheng. Shangshu Zhu Shi was sent to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to discuss the construction of the sea dike, and special attention was paid to the sea dike in Haining. When he left, Emperor Shizong of the Qing Dynasty instructed Zhu Shi, saying, "Your trip to survey the dike is also to repay your teacher's kindness and should be careful"! This is because Zhu Shi and the Chen family of Haining had the friendship of teacher and younger brother. In the eleventh year of Yongzheng, more than 1.8 million taels of silver were allocated to start construction. Afterwards, they were gradually built. In the twenty-seventh year of Qianlong, he made his third southern tour and went to Haining to inspect the sea dike. He ordered the annual repair of the wooden dike in Lao Yancang and added a stone weir to protect it. He also personally inspected the stone dam (Tasha Dike) between Jianshan and Tasha and changed it to a strip of stone dam. He then inspected the Fujian Navy from the Tide Viewing Tower. In the thirtieth year of Qianlong, he made his fourth southern tour and arrived in Hangzhou in February, ordering the construction of the Haining stone dike. In the forty-fifth year of Qianlong, he made his fifth southern tour and went to Haining in March to watch the tide. He visited Jianshan. He ordered that all the Fish Scale Stone Dikes that were thin be rebuilt. The 4,200 feet of wooden dikes that could be rebuilt into stone dikes were also surveyed and handled together. In the forty-ninth year of Qianlong, he made his sixth southern tour and visited Jianshan in Haining to inspect the dike project. Although the project was completed, there were still many uncoordinated places. He then built a stone dike to the Wulong Temple, allocated 5 million taels of silver from the Ministry of Revenue, and connected the various allowances issued earlier, limiting the construction in sections from east to west within five years. The Hu Haining Dike took more than 60 years from launch to completion and cost approximately 10 million taels of silver; based on current prices and labor costs, it is approximately ten times that of the time, which means that it would cost 100 million taels of silver to complete it now.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Picture of the Tragic Situation of the Haining Drought <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— (Bingru)</p>
<p>Emperor Qianlong went to Jiangnan six times, and four of them, in addition to sightseeing, can be said to be for the sea dike of Haining. Some people think that during the Qianlong period, the Yellow River overflowed 20 times, but it was never heard that Gaozong personally inspected it. However, he personally inspected the dike of Haining four times and allocated huge sums of money (one of which was 5 million taels); moreover, when he arrived in Haining, he resided in the Anlan Enclosure of the Chen family, which further deepened people's surprise and astonishment. Why was Emperor Qianlong so close to Haining? The author has no way to verify it, so I will leave it for the next time!</p>

<p>— Bao Chen</p>
<p>The news of the drought disaster from my hometown (Haining) does not seem to have hurt me in any way, because I have been a maritime resident for several years and have never been panicked about "water".</p>
<p>This time, for a small matter, I took the opportunity to return home and stayed for five days. During these five days, I drank water with "earthy breath and muddy taste" and heard news of farmers in a certain township and village robbing rice. After lunch, I ran to the street, which was deserted like the first day of the Lunar New Year. I couldn't find the police standing guard; it is said that there were originally fifty police officers in our town, and more than thirty were sent to the countryside 丨丨 to intimidate and capture those rice-robbing villagers 丨丨 so there were not enough positions to be assigned.</p>
<p>"Tea sheds are being set up again in Huangdao Lake (Note 1) to sell tea!" A familiar person said to me on the road.</p>
<p>"Oh, Huangdao Lake, selling tea." I heard this story from my grandmother more than ten years ago. That was the year Xianfeng six of the Qing Dynasty. My grandmother saw it with her own eyes. If she were still alive, she would have been one hundred and one years old. Huangdao Lake is only eight or nine miles away from my hometown, so I wanted to take this opportunity to take a look.</p>
<p>At noon on the fifth day of my return home, we actually arrived at Huangdao Lake. Ha, this is where the "lake" is, it's simply a sports field! There is a natural swimming pool in the middle of the field, which is probably the ruins of Huangdao Lake? The Changshuiyan Bridge with twenty-seven bridge gates is erected on this wide field, revealing a full look of naivety. She can only be paired with Yan Ziling's fishing platform now. (Note 2)</p>
<p>Sure enough, many tea sheds were set up on the wide field. We did not drink tea there. Seventy-nine years ago, my grandmother (she was a twenty-something girl at that time) had also drunk tea here, I thought.</p>
<p>"Sir, do you know Old Man Youfu? He is ninety-two years old this year. Only he has seen the tea sheds set up in Huangdao Lake for the second time!" The person who poured the boiled water said to me.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen him." I said, "Is there any way to find him to talk to him?"</p>
<p>"He is drinking tea in the tea shed next door! But he is deaf, so there is nothing to talk about."</p>
<p>"Never mind him, just ask him to come over."</p>
<p>Old Man Youfu relied on his light and healthy waist and legs and actually ran to our tea shed alone. I greeted him respectfully and asked him to sit down, but he just smiled. We were eating eggs, so I peeled an egg and handed it to him. He shook his hands and started speaking in the Haiyan dialect, "Sin! Sin! Our country eggs should be eaten by the city people." While he was talking, he loaded his dry smoke, seeming to indicate that he would never accept it, so I had to take the egg back and pour him a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. Many people stood by and watched.</p>
<p>"Xianfeng Six." Old Man Youfu opened his mouth, "At that time, I was only fourteen years old. No, although I was young, I still remember clearly that tea shops were also open here. ...That Changshuiyan Bridge had not been built yet. ...I never thought I would see it again this year."</p>
<p>"Did the villagers come out to rob rice at that time too?" I asked him loudly.</p>
<p>There was no answer. He didn't hear.</p>
<p>"The emperor should exempt us from taxation this year. ...The villagers are very bitter!" He said to himself.</p>
<p>"Hey! Emperor! Old Man Youfu always says that." A young farmer stood by and said with a smile.</p>
<p>"If there was an emperor, in such a drought year, he would always think of a way for us villagers. Didn't Old Man Youfu say that 'Although the year of Xianfeng Six was barren, the villagers were not as bitter as they are now'?" An old woman with red eyes interjected.</p>
<p>Old Man Youfu saw that there were many people around him, so he stood up and left. He greeted us, seeming to say, "There are too many people here." My companion followed him, and walked all the way to the bottom of the Changshuiyan Bridge and took a photo of him. The companion came back and said happily, "This photo is of historical value!"</p>
<p>Old Man Youfu left, and the people in the community were still discussing. Some said, "Old Man Youfu is really blessed. His grandchildren are already several decades old." Some said, "That doesn't count as being blessed! He should have died early if he was really blessed. Isn't the situation in his family getting worse year by year? He used to catch fish here with a net himself, at such an age!"</p>
<p>I had no opinion on those gossips, so I proposed to go back.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I went back to Shanghai again. I didn't bring anything back except a photo of Old Man Youfu.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Huangdao Lake was originally named Lutiao Lake. It is located in the southwest of Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, bordering Haining County. The lake surface is very wide. There is the Changshuiyan Bridge above, which is one hundred and eighty steps long.</p>
<p>(Note 2) The ruins of Yan Ziling's Fishing Platform on Fuchun Mountain are high on the mountain, with no water underneath, which is just like the Changshuiyan Bridge we saw.</p>

<p>The Nining area is unfortunate and has suffered continuous disasters. The silkworm silk industry has declined since ancient times, and people's lives are struggling. The rural areas are already on the verge of bankruptcy; tens of thousands of households in the entire county are living on gruel every day. Unexpectedly, this year's yellow plum season has been bitterly dry, and all the green grass has withered. Four months have passed, and sweet rain has not fallen. As a result, the fields are cracked, the rivers are completely dry, and drinking water is difficult, let alone irrigation. The disaster victims are everywhere, and the tragic situation is difficult to express. The suicide of entire families is already not uncommon; and the robbing of rice and eating together has spread very widely. Thieves are rising, and robbery is rampant. There is already a phenomenon of the weak being thrown into the ravines and the strong risking their lives. Looking at the disaster situation, we deeply feel compassion and speculation. We hope that people of benevolence in the country and gentlemen from our hometown will generously donate to charity so that we can quickly plan for disaster relief, save the victims from sinking into disaster, and eliminate the disaster. The merit is immeasurable. The Haining Drought Disaster Relief Association respectfully announces.</p>

<p>Call loan interest rates fell to six-tenths of one percent... Auxiliary coins are exceptionally weak</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the banking sector was still on holiday, so the market atmosphere felt quite sluggish. The foreign exchange call rate showed a downward trend. Both the morning and afternoon sessions were at 0.6%, a decrease of 0.2% compared to the previous day. Bill transactions: morning session turnover was over 2.8 million, new transactions were over 300,000, afternoon session turnover was over 200,000, and turnover in the small general association was over 300,000. Money shops remitted over 33 million in foreign public funds, remittances from various routes were over 600,000, and foreign exchange collateral transactions took over 500,000, with new transactions over 700,000. There were no reports from bank remittances due to the holiday. As for auxiliary coins, the opening price for Jiangnan small silver coins in the morning session was 825 yuan, a 5 yuan increase compared to the previous day. However, due to weak trading, the afternoon session decreased by as much as 10 yuan, to only 815 yuan. As a result, it fell by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was only 6,000 coins in the morning session, and there was no news of the afternoon session. The opening price for Guangdong small silver coins in the morning session fell by 2.2 yuan to 745 yuan, and the afternoon session decreased by another 0.3 yuan to 744.7 yuan. As a result, it fell by 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 145,000 coins in the morning session and 90,000 coins in the afternoon session. Copper coins were at 322,000, a 5,000 increase compared to the previous day. The transaction price was 14,000 yuan in foreign currency, amounting to 45,080 strings of coins.</p>

<p>A report from the Sin Fung Foreign Exchange Company states that yesterday (the 22nd), although there was profit-taking by bulls in the New York stock market, the trend was still upward. The reason is that people's sentiment has improved compared to before. Furthermore, (1) President Roosevelt approved the creation of a new railway organization to allow the merger of two railway companies with the newly created one, and appointed Pan Lai, the general manager of the New Haven Railroad, to be in charge of all railway matters, granting him the authority to handle various railway issues. (2) Utility stocks have improved due to excessive short selling, and there is a general hope that the government will not use Public Works Administration funds when competing with private construction companies. (3) It is expected that the textile strike will be resolved soon. Silver stocks are stagnant and firm. It is rumored that the government is buying silver abroad again, and it is also rumored that the price of new domestic silver ore will be increased. The trading volume in half a day was 280,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e226">After the Silk Flower Festival, Actual Demand Needs to Improve, the Cotton Yarn Market Sees Large Gains and Small Pullbacks <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market saw morning gains and afternoon declines, but actual demand showed some improvement. The North [illegible characters] brand was particularly strong, with substantial purchases of 17-count and 10-count yarns. Domestic procurement was also present. According to one source, most of this involved speculative activity. Shen Xin took advantage of the price increases to sell over 2,000 bales, demonstrating the factory's robust yarn output. Foreign yarn business saw a significant recovery due to domestic yarn sales. However, yesterday was the last day of the month for yarn, and despite some buyers maintaining purchases, the market remained sluggish. The closing price was 173.5 yuan, down 7.5 yuan from August.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Gold Rooster's Near-Term Decline, Far-Term Gains: Speculative Yarn Market <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The speculative yarn market opened with a decline in near-month contracts due to the downward trend in American cotton. Trading was flat in the morning with slight declines. However, the far-term contracts rose, as Tianjin buyers showed interest in Chinese-made yarn. Consequently, the price rose with each subsequent trade. The market became even more active at closing, with prices increasing by 2.5 to 1.3 yuan across all months. In the afternoon, the market opened with reports of 2,000 bales of spot yarn traded, and over 1,000 bales of speculative trading. Buying interest remained high, and prices continued to rise across all months. However, it was reported that actual spot yarn transactions were only about 200 bales. The high prices triggered hedging sales by manufacturers, causing a sudden pullback in the market. As a result, prices fell by 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 57,350 bales. Xie Sheng sold 750 bales, Xie Cheng 510 bales, Ji Feng 1,050 bales, Tong Fu 600 bales, Yuan Da 1,300 bales, Chang Feng 850 bales, Xin Cheng 950 bales, Da Feng 850 bales, Da Fu 750 bales, and Shen Yu 950 bales.

<h3 id="e228">Reasons for the Cotton Market's Sluggishness <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Retreats ... Weather is Clear and Fair</p>
<p>More Sellers Than Buyers ... Factory Appetite is Not Strong</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose but then fell, due to the sluggishness of the American and Indian cotton markets and the clear, fair weather, which is expected to increase the supply of new cotton. As a result, the market became weaker. However, speculators have absorbed a considerable amount and show no intention of releasing their holdings, so the market remains relatively stable.</p>
<p>Speculative Cotton: The market opened with a decline due to the downward trend in American and Indian cotton. There were more sellers than buyers, and market prices were flat and weak. Rumors circulated of Japanese traders dumping cotton. However, as the market closed, the rising price of yarn pulled the cotton market up. As a result, prices rose by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan across all months. In the afternoon, short sellers added to their positions, and the yarn market leveled off. Prices then fell by 0.25 yuan across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 101,900 dan. Xie Cheng sold 1,800 dan, Yu Kang 2,100 dan, Ji Feng Yi Di 200 dan, Tong Ji 1,500 dan, Tai Xing 1,200 dan, Geng Feng 1,700 dan, Shen Chang 2,800 dan, Shen Ji 2,000 dan, Chang Feng 5,000 dan, Tong He 2,000 dan, Xin Cheng 1,100 dan, Hong Chang 1,600 dan, and Chang He 5,700 dan.

<p>Last week, futures were weak due to profit-taking by long positions and short covering. There were few significant transactions. Export demand increased slightly, with Europe buying Ping Guer and new goods, and Mumula. Japan reduced purchases. Shanghai bought lower-grade Ping Guer, with both Pila cotton regions showing improvement compared to the past.

<p>Corn, Raw Peanuts, Soybeans</p>
<p>New Goods Have All Been Released</p>
<p>Yesterday, new goods included 10 bags of Suqian corn, of good quality, though the color was not ideal. The local trade association purchased it at a price of 2.8 yuan. The price was relatively loose due to the small quantity. More arrivals may come today or tomorrow, and it would not be surprising if the market price increased.</p>
<p>New peanuts from Dali 集货 arrived in 12 bags at a price of 6.2 yuan. Raw new peanuts from Teng County arrived in 14 bags at a price of 9.5 yuan. Peanuts from Yantai arrived in 4 bags at a price of over 10 yuan. The product was acceptable.</p>
<p>New soybeans from Tianjin Jin Yuan arrived in 1,035 bags. The quality varied, with the best offered at 4.8 yuan, and the average at 4.4 yuan. The local trade association purchased them all. The color was not ideal and they were small in size, but their overall quality was still the best among the newly harvested beans. Soybeans from Dalian Siping Street also arrived in 5 cars, but the quality was inferior, with only 50-60% acceptable, and the color was also poor. Four of the cars were consigned for sale elsewhere, while one car was offered at 4.3 yuan. There was also a carload of beans being sold from the railway consignment, priced at 4.2 yuan.</p>
<p>New soybeans from the Jinpu Railway, including 300 bags of Xuzhou beans and 50 bags of Tushan beans, were priced at 3.25 yuan. The quality and color were acceptable, though the Suining beans were slightly inferior, with a price of 3.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of old soybeans stabilized slightly, as sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices and mostly held on to their goods. In addition to the local trade, buyers from Ningbo were also inquiring, so market sentiment became more stable. Yesterday, the local trade purchased over 1,200 bags of Qing soybeans from Niuzhuang due to a shortage of high-quality old soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.82 yuan to 3.74 yuan, which invigorated the market.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Speculative Rice Prices Firm at Origin <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Spot Prices Down Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for imported Indica rice was dull as customers had not yet returned after the festival. Only a few hundred bags of Zhangzhou unpolished rice were purchased by inland buyers. There were virtually no other transactions. The local trade also remained cautious, and both imported and local rice were plentiful in the market. Therefore, market sentiment had not yet improved. Furthermore, the local trade made every effort to lower prices, so the spot prices of imported and local Indica rice both decreased slightly. A total of 1,600 bags of spot imported rice and 2,300 bags of local Indica rice were traded, with the local trade purchasing all but a small amount of Zhangzhou unpolished rice for inland trade. Speculative rice prices at the origin were firm, and foreign firms and hoarders were unwilling to sell cheaply. New speculators were optimistic and inquired. Sellers intended to offset losses, so the price for November delivery from Saigon reached 5.07 yuan and October delivery 5.00 yuan, up 0.05 to 0.06 yuan from the previous market price. All of this was purchased by the local trade.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Sharp Drop of 0.30 to 0.40 Yuan for New Lu Jian Rice <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various traders' supply was tight due to the suspension of shipping during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Over 40 boats (totaling over 7,000 shi) of rice were waiting downstream. Buyers purchased 600-700 bags of late-season rice from Qingdao and Yantai, so it was quite tight. Demand and sales of thick Japonica rice were balanced, which stabilized prices. Demand for new Japonica rice was still acceptable and supply was limited, so market sentiment was stable, with prices up slightly. However, the opposite was true for new Lu Jian rice, as the arrival of goods was too abundant, leading to an oversupply. Prices plummeted by 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. Prices of new Yang Jian rice also fell by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Bian Yuan rice also continued its downward trend as the supply of new goods gradually increased, falling by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over the past two days, over 30 boats arrived from the river. Supply of West New Japonica and New Yang Jian rice was low, and prices were high by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. There was interest in buying fresh top-quality thin rice. Prices were firm. Prices for New Ke Jian, New Du Jian and East New Japonica rice were slightly lower. Prices for Bai Po rice were stable. Other prices were stable. Only the price of upper-grade Bai Po rice was slightly soft.</p>

<p>Stocks of old white tung oil have been sold out, and it will still be two months before new production becomes available. During this transition period, exports continue unabated, so demand exceeds supply everywhere. Consequently, the market in Hankou is trending higher. The highest price last week was 33.8 yuan, and even recently, it was still 32.2-32.3 yuan. This is due to limited trading. According to a Hankou telegram yesterday, the price was already 31.8 yuan. However, the supply from all sources is dwindling daily. If there are large-volume transactions, a sharp price increase is inevitable. All sources in Zhejiang province are reportedly sold out. Merchants in Hangzhou also have no stock. According to a friend from Hangzhou, the asking price to be delivered to Shanghai is 29.2-29.3 yuan per stone. Fortunately, domestic sales are currently quiet. Only a small amount can be diverted for foreign trade. If a large quantity is desired, it will have to wait until new production becomes available.</p>

<p>Sapium oil sales were initially strong due to the harvest season, and the early autumn was quite promising. However, after the Ghost Festival, sales have not improved and are less robust than in early autumn. Furthermore, the supply from Hankou is also gradually increasing, so the market is now peaceful. At its highest, Chong Jing oil from Hankou was at 16.4-16.5 yuan per stone, Ping Jing at 15.7-15.8 yuan, and Macheng oil at 15.6-15.7 yuan per dan. However, due to oversupply, prices have gradually declined. Currently, it has fallen by 1.4-1.5 yuan. Therefore, according to yesterday's Hankou telegram, Chong Jing oil is only around 15 yuan, Ping Jing oil is 14.4-14.5 yuan, and Macheng oil is only around 14 yuan. Zhejiang sapium oil also saw a price increase, with the highest price for Nei Ping oil exceeding 20 yuan. Recently, it has fallen to 19 yuan. Jiaxing oil in western Zhejiang province was as high as 21.5 yuan per dan, but now it is only 20 yuan. Local merchants in Shanghai have never had large stockpiles. However, with a steady stream of arriving goods and the willingness to sell cheaply, merchants have not been buying from Hankou for some time, as the goods arriving are sufficient to supply the market. This is all about prioritizing nearby sources. Autumn sales are not as good as in previous years. Recently, it was also the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the market has become even more lackluster. Generally speaking, it is expected that there may be a slight improvement after the festival, but that remains to be seen. The current selling price for Chong Jing oil is slightly above 18 yuan, Ping Jing oil is 17.7-17.8 yuan, and Macheng oil is around 16 yuan.</p>

<p>Sichuan Province is conducting trials on autumn silkworm rearing this year. The new autumn cocoons will soon be on the market. Spring cocoon silk is now being shipped out one after another. The supply is quite active. In the past week, Minsheng and other ships have transported a total of 113 pieces of yellow silk from Mianzhou and Wuyang. These have all been retrieved by yellow silk merchants for sale.</p>

<p>Due to the impact of drought in the four rural areas of Wuxi, fewer than 2,000 sheets of silkworm eggs were raised. Late-season silkworms are doing better than early-season ones. The early-season silkworms suffered damage from the weather during their major molt, resulting in a poor cocoon yield. The highest price for fresh cocoons was 20 yuan, and the lowest was 14 yuan. The supply on the market is not strong. The late-season silkworms have completed their major molt and started feeding. The sunny and warm weather is favorable for their development, and a good cocoon harvest is expected.</p>

<p>Recently, the North has been trading in 26-gauge black iron sheets briskly, with daily transactions reaching as many as 300 to 400 dan. However, the supply of goods is not abundant, so the market goods are sold upon arrival. Local thermos bottle factories and enamel factories also have appetite, so a considerable amount of goods scheduled to arrive in the future has been snapped up, leading to a gradual increase in standard prices of 0.30 to 0.40 yuan. Currently, spot goods are estimated at 11 yuan for the prime grade and 10 yuan for the secondary grade. Futures are offered at 10.025 yuan for the prime grade and 9.75 yuan for the secondary grade. In addition, miscellaneous goods such as 25-gauge, 6-gauge, and 55-gauge, 25-gauge goods are estimated at around 9 yuan, as their quality is inferior and the dimensions are not very suitable, so very few are offered.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable as customs duties did not fluctuate much. The guild's quotations for 24 raw granulated white sugar were stable at 19.55 yuan for spot goods. Merchants were asking for 0.05 yuan more, at 19.7 yuan, but there were no transactions. Re-exported goods were priced at 6.25 yuan, down slightly by 0.05 yuan. Grade 8/9 Dutch red sugar spot goods were 14 yuan, and re-exported goods were 5 yuan, with few transactions. Tai Gu Sugar B 嘇 sugar was 19.9 yuan, and local factory powdered sugar grade 1 was 18 yuan. It was found that stocks of Qing sugar from Chaozhou area have been sold out. Local stocks were also not abundant. Yesterday, 莊 Qing sugar was offered at 13.5 yuan, and Long Gang Qing oil-wrapped sugar at 12.3 yuan, with a total of over 100 bags traded. Judging by the market trend, there should be a possibility of a rebound.</p>

<p>The first batch of Quanzhou Pao Yuan dried bean curd, amounting to 3,000 pieces, arrived before the festival. However, goods from Putian, Tong'an, Anhai and other places arrived at the same time, resulting in an oversupply. Therefore, the market was weak, and merchants were bidding as much as 5-6 yuan below the offered price, resulting in no transactions. Both sides are currently in disagreement. It is heard that there will be another discussion today. If there is a convergence of opinions, a deal may be reached, but sellers will inevitably suffer losses. The only question is how much the losses will be.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Christ Was Not From Judea <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>The telegraph dispatch on the 19th reported that the National Socialist Catholic in Germany (加特立穆勒) spoke in Hanover, arguing that under National Socialism, there can only be one country, one nation, and one church. Protestantism (Christianity) and Catholicism must merge into one national church, and any resistance will be punished with exile. What is particularly interesting is that, in order to avoid contradicting their anti-Semitism, they explained that (Christ was not from Judea) and was the first to declare war on the Jews.</p>
<p>Here, we naturally do not want to argue about a question that only Jesus's parents would know. What is worth examining is what is the significance of Germany making Jesus's (origins unclear) in this way. In European history, international wars have been caused by disagreements over religious denominations. In order to avoid internal unity being affected by religious relations, especially when relations between Italy and Germany are strained over the Austrian issue, and after the Pope opposed Hitler's religious policies, one of the reasons Germany announced the merger of the Old and New Churches. Secondly, after the swastika flag has been flying in Germany for more than a year, Hitler's most moving slogans of abolishing the Treaty of Versailles and solving the economic crisis have become (long dreams with many problems). In order to divert the people's dissatisfaction, he has played many new tricks, and the church merger is one of these methods. This is the second point. Furthermore, saying that Jesus was not of Jewish origin is obviously like Zheng Xiaoxu using the Way of Kings to cover up his own treasonous behavior, forcibly pulling Confucius and forcing Jesus to find other parents, each as their own political weapon.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Prison Joy <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Old Blow</p>
<p>A friend's servant was arrested on suspicion of theft, but he was not guilty. Later, thanks to the righteousness of the real thief, he was not falsely accused. It was proven that he was not an accomplice, and he was not questioned about the matter. He was detained in prison for three weeks before being released.</p>
<p>According to the servant, although prison is not easy, it is not entirely a miserable situation. There are also considerable moments of happiness. Truly, there is a land of joy in prison, no need for reputation or instruction.</p>
<p>In prison, apart from the absolute inability to find a way to secretly smoke opium, there is still a way to think about cigarettes, but the price is very high because they are contraband. Approximately every ten "Beautiful Brand" cigarettes cost four mao (small coins). And cigarettes are one of the most welcomed items by fellow inmates. If any of the inmates buys them, the owner at most gets to smoke two or three of the ten cigarettes, and the rest are quickly divided among his fellow brothers.</p>
<p>And the ways to solicit cigarettes also come with several different faces. Some take on the face of an uncle to ask for them, while others use lamentations, and before even half of the lament is finished, the cigarette is snatched away by a fellow inmate from the side and placed in his own mouth. This situation is roughly based on the qualifications and personality of the fellow inmate to determine the method used.</p>
<p>If a fellow inmate is found to have money, it is certain that they will be squeezed by their fellow inmates to treat them to something. Although cigarettes, alcohol, and other items are prohibited in prison, ordinary food can be bought at will and is not prohibited. Sometimes, when squeezing money from someone who has it, they will ask him to treat them to meat, which is also a very common thing (because fish and meat are not more expensive than outside the prison). The cooks also know the situation well, so they cut the meat into very small pieces. But after it is cooked and sent to the prison gate, the general fellow brothers who are waiting at the prison gate are already like customers at a newly opened grocery store, crowding outside the iron gate. As soon as they see the meat coming in, those with chopsticks use chopsticks, those with hands use hands, and they all attack the meat together. In an instant, it is all gone. The owner, at most, gets to drink some soup or some side dishes. This situation is extremely amusing.</p>
<p>Also, if they see that you have money, someone will come to flatter you. If you are assigned to wash dishes or pour out spittoons or toilets, they will come forward to do the work for you. If they know that you have money at home, the fellow inmates will definitely say, "What's the use of money to him? Now is the last time for you to use money. Why don't you write a letter home to ask for it?" If you can't write a letter, we can write it for you. We can fulfill some obligations for you.</p>
<p>Fellow inmates also have a happy time, which is when they are assigned to pour out spittoons and toilets. Prison inmates cannot step beyond the prison gate on ordinary days. At this time, they can take advantage of being on public duty to go outside. Having been in prison for a long time, the chest feels stuffy. At this benefit, they do not realize that the sky is high and the air is fresh, and their minds are broadened, truly like the students in private schools in the past who faked drinking tea and faked urinating. As for the inmates in the flat hall, they also have a few minutes of walking time every day, but general exercise is not as good as the joy of emptying toilets and spittoons. These are mostly the joyful situations in prison.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is also seen that in extremely serious situations, a certain prisoner is taken away for questioning. A moment later, several gunshots can be heard faintly. At this time, one cannot help but feel a little nervous and frightened, and they lose color looking at each other. If there are important criminals in prison, fellow inmates often use words that do not enter the ears to encourage each other. They generally say, "The case you committed is nothing serious. Even if there are any mishaps, everyone only dies once. You can say that you died with a cause. You can rest assured, there is no need to be afraid, no need to think about it."</p>
<p>The writer notes that this is truly a land of joy in prison, but their joy is finding happiness in suffering, a kind of boring happiness. Those who usually act lawlessly outside do not know to love themselves. Once they are imprisoned, they realize the preciousness of freedom, but it is already too late. Although there is a land of joy within, it is still best not to ask about it.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Watching a Fight <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ren</p>
<p>Looking at the rain outside the window, a feeling of depression arises in my heart. Across from me is the attic room in the back alley. They have also closed their windows, wanting to enjoy the "rain scene" for themselves. It seems that this background is too simple; it is even more out of the question to write a poem about the scenery.</p>
<p>But people who add fun come to embellish this lonely rain scene, and there is not just one. It's as if they were specially sent to this alley to give me entertainment. They are a pair of typical figures that we can often see on the road. Looking down from above, their silk sleeves are rolled up very high. Although they are both wearing soft, straw hats, their straight faces can still be seen [illegible character]</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Roughly speaking, in other words, it is that the angle of their straw hats is sharper than the usual way of wearing hats. I first discovered this pair of friends who add fun when I heard two "What the hell" kinds of Shanghai words. It is said that water transmits sound, so although the windows were closed, the sound was very loud and powerful. In this simple setting, finding two sons of "hell" [meaning curse words], I had to open the window to see what was going on. It's really strange. As soon as my head peeked out of the window, many people had already gathered at the back door of the house across the alley. Naturally, these two sons of "hell" were trapped in the core. If applied to the art of film, it is the so-called overhead shot; however, I feel very regretful that I cannot see their legs clearly, so although I have skillful photographic cultivation, I cannot think of taking a photo to keep as a souvenir.</p>
<p>It should be stated here that the sky continued to drizzle, but those two friends who add fun became even more excited, jumping and gesticulating in the crowd. Their "hells", "sisters", "ancestors", and even "ancestors" all joined the battle from their mouths. Their voices were also getting louder and louder, giving the impression that Heaven made me, why did you make me? But do not say that I am watching a fight in the clouds, I think that instead of waving their hands in the air, why not just punch him in the heart? If the other party lost his footing and fell to the ground, the audience (or me) would cheer: "Hero forever!" But this continued for at least ten minutes. My desk was already full of raindrops. Naturally, the achievements on the bodies of the friends who added fun and those spectators were quite considerable. The fight had not yet succeeded. Anxious spectators shouted sideways ("Fight! Fight!"). With this cheer, my spirits lifted. If one of these two friends was in front of me, hum, I would send him home with this punch. But this shake quickly returned to normal. The hands of the parties were still waving wildly in the air for a while. All the "hells" and "ancestors" were finally [shouting] "Please", "I'll fight you!" I don't know why I am so enthusiastic. When I heard "Fight", [again, my] chest straightened up ("or just for the sake of watching the fight"). I thought that this time it would definitely be four fists waving, two heads colliding, a hard-fought and inextricable battle, a fight to the death. That group of rain-soaked spectators made the surrounding area even smaller so that they could see more clearly. Although I was alone in the window, I was not afraid of the rain and poked out my head. My own hands seemed to be full of strength. Just at this critical moment, an older man pushed through the crowd and desperately pulled and tore, trying to dissuade this "fight" situation; but if he had not tried to persuade them, it would have been fine, but with the persuasion, the two men's fists swung like raindrops. That older man became their shield and arrow target, and he was so scared that he hurriedly broke out of the encirclement. Strangely enough, the two friends immediately stopped and walked out along a gap, saying, "Hum, look at the old man's power!" Until they were completely out of my sight, a spectator looked up and greeted me. I asked them what they were doing. He thought I had not seen this scene and replied earnestly, "Fighting!"</p>
<h3 id="e243">Ah Xiu <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>As soon as the autumn wind began to blow, Ah Xiu fell ill.</p>
<p>The grass raincoat-constructed hut, over time, became dilapidated with holes here and there. Looking up, one could see the azure sky. And the autumn rains were especially heavy, lasting for several days in a row. Rainwater streamed down through the holes, flowing everywhere, every puddle on the ground becoming a pool of water, dripping incessantly, from morning till night.</p>
<p>Basking in the sun in summer, getting drenched in autumn rain, a family of three – Ah You, her husband, and a child not yet ten years old – lived in this dilapidated hut, enduring the long days.</p>
<p>The husband lost his job two months ago. Since then, he couldn't find work anywhere.</p>
<p>And autumn had arrived again. The chilly morning breeze made people anticipate the icy cold winter that would follow. Poor families all frowned. Winter clothes were all locked away in the pawnshop, and their livelihood was uncertain. What to do? Worried about the approaching winter days, worried about the meals for the family of three.</p>
<p>The weight of worry exceeded what a frail body could bear, so Ah Xiu fell ill. So this was no ordinary illness, but one caused by too much depression and too much worry, sinking into the boundless edges of depression and worry. She couldn't bear it, and her spirit weakened day by day.</p>
<p>The illness worsened with the increasing sense of depression, and she lay in bed all day, groaning hysterically. Ah Xiu had almost lost the strength to even support herself and move around.</p>
<p>The sound of groaning mixed with the sound of raindrops, creating a desolate harmony.</p>
<p>(The child circles the edge of the bed, repeatedly tugging at Ah Xiu's wrist, complaining of hunger, wanting to eat).</p>
<p>(Wait a little! Daddy will definitely bring something back for you when he returns).</p>
<p>(Go wait at the door, Daddy will be back soon).</p>
<p>The mother opened her lifeless eyes, like the eyes of a dead fish. She painfully looked at the child's face. She stretched out a withered, firewood-like hand and stroked the child's head. In a low voice, she coaxed the child, barely able to catch her breath. The child listened to her mother's words and rushed out the door to wait for her father.</p>
<p>Two strings of crystal-clear tears silently crawled down Ah Xiu's pale yellow cheeks, like snails.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the father had gone to the factory with Yuan Er Sao, a female neighbor and friend of Ah Xiu, to ask for back wages. He had also asked Yuan Er Sao to request another leave of absence from the factory.</p>
<p>If she could get all of the half-month's back pay, the family of three could live a bit more comfortably for half a month. Besides this, Ah Xiu's only hope was that her body would recover quickly, so she could go back to work soon.</p>
<p>Because if she couldn't go to work, all three of them would go hungry.</p>
<p>Ah Xiu thought about this and that, becoming so tired that she felt sleepy. In a hazy feeling, she suddenly glimpsed Yuan Er Sao being chased and pushed down by someone against the wall outside the factory gate. She struggled for a long time but couldn't get up. Then, several large men emerged, and her husband was being held by the collar by two people, dragged and chased, she didn't know where they were pushing him to.</p>
<p>With a jolt, Ah Xiu woke up and rubbed her eyes. Her body was still lying on the hard wooden bed. It turned out that it had all been a nightmare. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Huiren</p>
<p>Rain, in the clear autumn morning, drifting in strands, looking like the plum rain of April, but the climate not as humid and stuffy as during the plum rain season. Although there was no wind blowing, it was already much cooler. The morning glories on the wall outside the window were in full bloom, and it seemed that the vines had climbed higher today than yesterday. The flowers, which were only two or three yesterday, had also increased a lot today, among the verdant leaves, setting off red, purple, and blue flowers, looking truly gentle and lovely. The sky hung high above the spire of the chapel, and no floating clouds could be found flying. Sometimes, one or several rays of sunlight pierced through the uniformly colored sky, filtered through the drizzle, and shone on the top of the chapel, but they didn't evoke much warmth, instead, there was a sense of strange bleakness. Except for the mournful chirping of autumn insects, almost everything around was in stillness.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm left over from the hot summer had completely disappeared at this time. Although the gloom of autumn made people feel a bit uncomfortable, it was already much more refreshing than the heartbreaking spring and the restless summer.</p>
<p>But, in fact, something detracted from the heroic autumn morning, and that was the sound of gunfire disrupting the quiet of the autumn morning. These rattling and popping sounds really made people feel a bit terrified. Listening to the sound of leather shoes running fast on the street, one knew that they were practicing street fighting.</p>
<p>Then I remembered a sentence that Shawpona once said, namely; "ＭytheＷayofuokihgistotellthetruthlfworld" My jokes are the truth of the world. (Translated by the author) Now I chew on this witty remark once, twice, three times, even ten or twenty times, but I still can't get anything out of it, and even want to seek an answer in the snow-white beard and spirited and mischievous eyes of old man Xiao, but in the end, I am still confused, not knowing the true meaning of this sentence.</p>
<p>From one autumn several years ago until now, the sharp artillery fire has never stopped, and the terrifying sound seems to still vaguely linger in our ears. We seem to remember this sudden stimulus very clearly, and no truth has been sought out in mockery.</p>
<p>According to another group of people, the truth can only be obtained under the power of artillery fire. Then how should old man Suo's sentence be explained? I scratch my head and use all my strength to seek this answer, but the result is still a disappointment. However, there must be truth, and there are so many billions of people in the world who are longing for it. They don't seem to need to seek the truth in mockery, because if that were the case, they would have starved before they could find the truth.</p>
<p>At this time, the bells in the chapel rang loudly, and the sound of gunfire had subsided. The autumn rain was still drifting in the air.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Smoke <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>Like a loner who sees a cigarette as his only companion. Taking it, going out for a stroll, as intimately as taking a lover. Cigarettes have now become an indispensable necessity in my daily life.</p>
<p>At first, I didn't smoke, and I didn't even want to smoke. Not only didn't I want to smoke, but I also despised people who smoked. What's the taste? I always thought it was either a low-level expression of chasing fashion or a pointless waste. You think, holding it in your mouth, it's both bitter and astringent. Why not use this money to buy rice, chocolate, or something like that? Chewing it would at least have the sweetness that cigarettes don't have. But everyone likes it, it's like that everywhere, even young ladies and young performers smoke as if they know what they're doing. They bite a cigarette in their mouths, draped in cigarette ash, looking quite imposing. The allure of cigarettes is really not small. I always couldn't stand it. When I saw people smoking, I felt disgusted, not just disgusted, but also quite annoyed. I always avoided them, and almost wanted to snatch the cigarette from the smoker's mouth. But the smokers were enjoying it. Sometimes I was inexplicably angry for a long time.</p>
<p>I used to hate cigarettes and smokers to this extent. But now, I have actually turned into a smoke fiend, and my addiction is probably greater than that of the average person. I don't even know how it happened. From morning to night, I have a cigarette in my mouth, whether sitting or standing. Sometimes it's almost to the point where I can skip eating, but I can't skip smoking. It's simply my second life.</p>
<p>After smoking, I deeply realize that cigarettes do have many functions and subtle sensations that words cannot describe. They are almost more necessary than food.</p>
<p>The inspiration, illusions, and intoxication that cigarettes can give me are endless.</p>
<p>In the quiet and silent late night, under the quiet and bright lamplight, a person smokes, one cigarette after another, puffing away, slowly blowing out the smoke, watching the layers of smoke, one smoke ring after another, white and hazy, curved, winding up, transforming into various beautiful shapes. Eventually, they dissipate. After a while, it happens again. With half-closed eyes, putting one's mind and body in a state of self-forgetfulness, like sleepwalking in a field of colored gauze, each layer of smoke carries a faint, light meditation, and carries even more comforting longings that make the soul comfortable, faintly, so that they cannot be touched.</p>
<p>And one no longer feels lonely. Once one starts smoking, it's as if there is an invisible figure accompanying one's mind and body, and the soul has blended with it in a leisurely manner.</p>
<p>When one is bored, one often forgets the boredom because of cigarettes. Grasping the pen, staring blankly for a long time, unable to write a single word, one smokes a cigarette, and literary thoughts or inspiration naturally float up. Cigarettes have thus become the solace of my spirit, the lover of my spirit.</p>
<p>The reason cannot be explained. Even if it can be explained, it's still better not to. Leaving a bit of mysterious feeling in the soul is quite interesting. Once it's explained, it won't work. But if one understands why smoke must ultimately be drawn out from the mouth, and fly from the house to the outside of the window; why ripples rise on the water when the breeze blows; why stars twinkle; and why people are so fond of cigarettes – it's all the same. Understanding these things can reveal the secrets of smokers.</p>
<p>Actually, there are no secrets. All that's needed is a knowing smile and understanding.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Diploma and Unemployment <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Recently, this column has received many letters from young students who have encountered difficulties in terms of qualifications regarding the current educational administration and graduation diplomas, and are requesting the editor to help them resolve these issues. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the transitional era of reforming education and administration, and it is necessary to discuss it. Now, let's first analyze the questions asked.</p>
<p>(1) Cannot find a job because of lacking a graduation diploma</p>
<p>(2) Without a graduation diploma, even if one has the same level of education and financial ability, one cannot go to accredited secondary or higher schools.</p>
<p>(3) Accredited universities and secondary schools refuse to allow students who have not passed the joint entrance examination to take the exam.</p>
<p>(4) Students of unaccredited missionary schools cannot go to accredited schools.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the first question first.</p>
<p>other people introduce you, it is very difficult. Many people with high qualifications and academic abilities are also encountering the difficulty of unemployment. This kind of qualification-limiting situation can show the seriousness of the unemployment panic and the public's desire to pay a low price and hire people with higher abilities. Therefore, this is really not a matter of diplomas or not, but how to solve the unemployment panic and make demand exceed supply.</p>
<p>We feel that these people without graduation diplomas do not need to worry too much, because although all agencies and shops, etc., specify the minimum qualifications when hiring personnel, they will never only want qualifications and diplomas, and not need people with real talent and practical knowledge to work for them! Therefore, as long as you have the ability, you can be attentive and work hard, you can always find the job you need and can handle.</p>
<p>As for positive remedial measures, the only option is to go to school to pursue a diploma. If qualifications and finances are also a problem, then you can go to a tutorial school. The certificate from this kind of school may be able to help a little.</p>
<p>The nature of the second, third, and fourth questions is similar. It is related to the entire education and administration issue. To talk about it, it is a long story. Due to space limitations, we can only talk about the attitude that students with unqualified qualifications should take during this transitional period of reforming education administration.</p>
<p>Now, many students are unable to go to school due to qualification restrictions, and often develop a sense of frustration and sadness. This is really wrong. You need to know that the purpose of going to school is to gain knowledge, not to get a diploma. Then where is not a place to learn? Your surroundings are really all knowledge that you can explore. Why must you study in this narrow school? And why feel frustrated because you cannot go to school?</p>
<p>Therefore, students of unaccredited schools and other students with unqualified qualifications, under this difficult situation, in addition to trying their best to transfer to accredited schools, when there is no other choice, they can only go to unaccredited schools or tutorial schools. It's still studying the same way. As long as you work hard and strive to improve, you will never be any different from accredited students. Because studying is entirely a personal matter. No matter how good the school is, if you do not have real ability, then even if you have a diploma, its effectiveness is limited!</p>
<p>Finally, the editor hopes that the education authorities will devise fundamental solutions to remedy these young people who have no access to education, such as re-holding identification exams for private school students, strictly investigating the contents of various unaccredited schools, forcing them to become accredited, and establishing specialized schools to accommodate these students with unqualified qualifications, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Uncle's Braid (10) (4) <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Hengfeng's business was very good, this was a very obvious fact. Although no one except old man Mao knew exactly how much money they made each day, it was quite impressive that they could sell two dou of soybeans' worth of tofu a day. In addition, old man Mao and his wife were both very amiable in business, and besides, there was only this one store in these hundred-odd villages, so every time old man Mao saw the spring couplets written for him by the schoolteacher posted on the storefront, ("The earth returns to spring, the four seasons are always flourishing"), ("The farmers are universally happy, the five grains are abundant"), plus the horizontal banner of ("Business is booming"), his chubby face could not help but smile. As for the schoolteacher, it could be seen from the sixteen words in the couplets that he was an extraordinary scholar, embedding the four characters of (Datian) (Hengfeng) in the middle. The village name and the store name were both inside, which was quite difficult. Although old man Mao was not a scholar, he still knew some characters himself. After some explanation by others, he understood these things very well.</p>
<p>Tonight, Gray Hen was once again drinking liquor by the counter, but this time it wasn't fennel beans to go with the liquor, but peanuts worth ten coins. Beside him, there were four people playing cards. In addition to the proprietress, there was also sixth grandfather, the tailor Xi Gou, and the barber Chang Yan, who lived in the village. In addition, Daoist priest (note) Jin Rong and the chicken castrator San Lantou were all watching the game. Boss Mao was leaning on the counter, smoking a water pipe. The kerosene lamp beside his hand, no matter how blackened the glass lamp shade was by the smoke, was much brighter than an oil lamp. That kind of light shone on his face, showing a kind of greyish-white color.</p>
<p>The air in the store was filled with the peaceful breathing of people. Obviously, the so-called Restoration or the Revolutionary Party and other major national events did not bring about significant changes among them. Although there were already two shaven-headed monks in the village, when everyone first heard about this news in the afternoon, they had discussed it excitedly. But by the evening, because most of the people were paying attention to the card game of twenty coins per dou, the win or loss of eighty coins for a dou of cards was indeed a large sum for them. So, words like ("A foreign devil") ("Two shaven heads") were not heard much now.</p>
<p>However, Gray Hen had never played cards in his life, so naturally, the card game of six or seven people could not arouse his interest at all. He was still quietly drinking his liquor and slowly peeling the peanuts. He occasionally stretched his head over the proprietress's shoulder to watch her play cards. The flame of the candle flickered and jumped, and it took a lot of effort for his eyes to see the cards clearly, so he thought that this "one wan, three cakes, six strings" kind of thing was ultimately meaningless. At the same time, lighting two red candles for the sake of playing cards would cost more than a hundred coins, which was too uneconomical.</p>
