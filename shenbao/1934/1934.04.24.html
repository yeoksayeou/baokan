<p>（倫敦）西門外相今日在下院宣佈、彼已照會日本、請解釋東京所發表之宣言、西門外相表示、關於日本之所謂拒絶各國援助中國政策之非正聲明、報紙已大事登載、彼覺現已屆接閱正式宣言之時機、</p>
<p>西門外相言及日本務省發言人之聲明、謂「此次聲明之動機、似由於别國在華之或種行動、恐將影響和平、中日關係、或中國之完整、英政府之任何政策無須疑懼其發生此類危險、因英政府目的實在避免此類危險也、惟此次聲明之一般性質及其詳細内容、例如對華財政援助之類、使吾必須行文日本」云、</p>
<p>茲悉英政府照會已電逹東京英大使、卽向本政府提出、更據消息靈通方面宣稱、西門外相之照會、將九國公約禁止任何國家在華謀取特殊權利之規定、促日本反省、該項公文或將於星</p>
<p>期三日公布、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相門今日午後在下院答覆關於日本對華政策之問話、自由黨領袖薩繆爾請外相注意日本駐美大使齋藤之聲明、並問英外相可否因此與美政府接洽、西門答稱、渠以爲俟與日本交涉後、再發宣言、較爲妥當、渠贊成薩繆爾之言、將來或須再發宣言云、保守黨凱塞建議舉行九國公約簽字國會議、但西門對此建議、未直接答覆、僅允經過各事通知下院、並謂渠今日能續有陳説、中國郭公使當西門發言時、在下院旁聽、後卽往晤西門商榷一切、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）中國駐外公使今日接得南京訓令、各主要國政府協議日本政策將急轉直下、或竟至引起國之實際行動也、中國駐倫敦·華盛頓·巴黎·羅馬·及其他國都、之外交官奉令、即行徵詢各國政府之意見、最低限度須</p>
<p>與各國協調、以九國公約警吿日本、堅持任何國家不得</p>
<p>在中國謀取特殊權利、而國會衆院已凖備於星期一日提出質問、</p>
<p>以迫請政府明白宣布其對遠東問題之態度、種種質問已不一而作、其中以凱碩爾爵士之質問爲最要、凱氏之質問曰、「日本重定其遠東政策以操縱中國之外交、外部已否接得日本任何通知、」諾克斯中將之質問亦頗重要、諾氏問政府是否得悉美擬承認「滿洲國」之説、工黨議員魏</p>
<p>特吾之質問爲「英國政府是否與美國交換意見、以謀對於日本之宣言採取聯合行動」、茲信西門外相將愼重答復、以避免表示反日之具體政策云、關於魏特吾之質問、英報已廣爲登載、至於美政領袖與新聞記者之非正式談話、曾稱美國願與英國合作、以謀對東京聲明所造成之遠東局勢、發一共同宣言一節、英報亦加討論、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）中國政府對日聲明書所發迭次宣言、此間報紙廣爲登載、人心漸定、二十二日下午華盛頓華僑開抗日大會、聞他埠亦有同樣舉動、（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">國聯下月開會　對日可轉强硬　關鍵在美國之贊助 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦方面深信日本此次對華政策宣言、具有一種驅使蘇聯加入國聯、使國聯更可得美國之襄助、使五月間國聯大會態度、轉爲强硬之可能、且足引起英法兩國保守黨及進步黨黨員之反動、蓋保守黨黨員之意見、本對日本估據滿洲、原抱冷淡態度、但現觀日本有意封鎖歐洲在中國貿易之門戶、造成中日聯合勢力、且凖備經一次世界大戰後、一躍而爲遠東之雄立、是故極爲驚駭、至歐洲之進步黨、原主張抑制日本之野心者、現更無疑問、此可由首相墨索里尼號召西方各國一致抵抗日本侵略政策之論文證明之、現西方列强、雖仍爲軍縮問題、意見相左、而無暇及此、但現覺危機之難避免、故未必卽能屈服於日本之要求、及放棄對中國之關係與對中國已見成效之技術合作也、（二十三日世界社電）</p>

<p>（東京）廣田外相關於外務當局之所謂非公式對華政策聲明、本日發表談話、首謂前次聲明、係以反覆闡明下列二點爲主、（一）闡明日本在東亞特位置責任及利益、促列國再確認、（二）對蔑視此種事實、離間中日、毁損東亞大局和平、如列國之對華援助、卽其結果藉對華援助之名、阻害日本政治上經濟上之利益、或威脅日本國防之安全、故帝國根據維持遠東和平之信念、不得不排擊之、乃列國及中國反誤解帝國之趣旨、甚至曲解此爲閉鎖對華門戶之聲明、舉世騷然、出於反日言動、殊不可解、外相繼又指摘日本在東亞之特殊利益及對華門戶開放主義、係兩立並存、此於當時海約翰國務長官提議開放門戶、日本欣然承諾之事實、足以證明、余確信美國其他列國正當之與論、必能了解此次聲明之根本趣旨、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）一九三五年在華盛頓召開之海軍軍縮會議、廣田外相欲令圓滿成立、須限定會議之討論議題爲海軍縮間題、應將遠東問題除外、且關於滿洲問題中國問題之感情傾軋、必須於會議之前解决、現方考慮對美工作、然美國對於十七日外務當局關於對華政策之非正式聲明、竟意外表示無理解量狹之態度、致於今後之對美工作、有困難之感、惟前次之聲明、係日本將最終且最小限度之希望、開陳於列國者、設有困難、亦必促英美、及其他之理解、故對於列國一部之策動及感情的反對、决意反覆聲明、貫徹根本信念云、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本紸美大使齋藤今日晤華盛頓星報記者、謂如與中國有商務關係之外國不理會日本所提出先商諸日本然後成事之請求、則日本將認爲不友好之行爲、外國絲毫未有如何應付華人之見解、法國銀行家近在歐洲市塲募集中國債欵、此事頗使日政府焦慮、如外國事業界代麦不理會日本之請求、則其責任當由中政府負之云、記者詢以日本是否與他國合作、共管中國、齋藤答稱、此種合作、在前或屬可能、但自滿洲事變後、已不復可能云、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3 id="c4">各國反日輿論 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>（莫斯科）此間報紙揭載世界報界對於日外務省所作對華政策聲明之各種評論、法報稱日本之企圖乃欲反對美國與蘇聯、同時此項聲明表示日本侵略成性之軍界之勝利、矛盾報謂、「日本正欲占有整個中國、太平洋之鬥爭已進入一新階段」、意報力稱日本對華策劃之公開侵略性質、講臺報表示日本之挺進、對於歐洲列强在遠東之利益、實有嚴重之威脅、紐約導報華盛頓記者謂、美國官方對日方聲明極不滿意、而於聲明中所稱日本爲保全東亞和平計、凖備訴諸武力一段、尤爲不惬、紐時報謂美國務院顯以方聲明一種試騐氣球、該報復稱、「政府負責人員預料東京方面不久將有某種聲明、並以現時局面爲異常嚴重云（二十一日塔斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）日外省發表聲明後、德意志日報社論評聲甚烈、謂日本竟明白排斥列强而以亞洲主人自居、廿一條勢將完全實現云、（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法報評論日本外務省反對各國援中國之宣言稱、日本外交政策將愈益實施一種遠東門羅政策、此政策實際上爲對美而發、與法無關、所可確言者、美國將全力反對日本之侵略政策、兩種門羅主義現成對峙形勢、兩國因此競擴軍備乃必然之結果也（二十二日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c18">國民應嚴切注意今日之局勢 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>——各國政府應該明瞭日本的野心——</p>
<p>日本這一次的對華外交聲明。雖含有多少試探性質。借此窺視各國的態度和我國的反響。可是這種聲明。却有極危險的毒素在内。其目的實欲置我國於其附庸屬國的地位。鑄成其所謂東亞門羅主義。暗示將以武力實行封閉中國的門戶。這樣逾越常軌的外交聲明。如果在歐洲。無論任何大國也不能施之於任何小國。因爲這是侮蔑對方國格。漠視國際信義。干涉友邦内政的舉動。可是日本到現在。依然口道和平。其實自「九一八」那晚起日本的行爲較之戰前德意志武裝保護和平的說法。還更兇很更毒辣更無理。</p>
<p>可惜我國自身。因爲國民經濟力的整個衰頽。國内的政局。没有完全統一。所以抵抗力非常薄弱。經過了幾次搏鬥之後。確是終於失敗了。但處今日我國的地位。應該不諱言失敗。並且要因失敗而檢查自身所以失敗的緣故。打開今後的正當出路。譬如有人患病應該卽行延醫診治。認清了病狀纔可以對症下藥。纔可以恢復健康。以此比喩。我國决不宜在這候自暴自棄。失望懊喪。俗語說。「好漢打脫門牙和血呑。」正可作我們自勉的座右銘。萬不可因爲門牙打脫了。就當作是什麽不治之症。而束手待斃。</p>
<p>至於歐美各國對於遠東局面的處置。我們曾受過不少的敎訓。曉得他們本身的利害。並不盡同。不會無端放棄其固有的立塲。但這次日本聲明發表後。英美兩國輿論界。爲了日本封鎖中國市塲的野心業已暴露。一旦成爲事實。其遠東貿易。便要根本動搖。所以不能不亟籌對策。以以維持門戶開放主義。在這點論來。日本的聲明。確有促進英美聯合。造成英美共同戰綫的可能。可是英美的輿論。雖已有反抗日本的表示。而其政府。到現在還未會仗義執言我們不能不引爲遺憾。</p>
<p>英美以外。蘇聯的態度。亦値得嚴密注意。現在蘇聯和本。雙方積極備戰。日本爲了克敵制勝起見。感覺脅制中國。爲其戰略上所必取的手段。原來日本現在。已處於孤立地位。倘没有與國可以拉攏。一旦對蘇開戰。再不能像第一次日俄戰爭那時博得世上多數人士的同情了。單就防止赤化這一點上看資本主業國家。也許可以偏向日本。但是資本主義國家中的兩大巨頭（英美）。必不肯爲了立國精神上的差異。而忘却了現實。反之。目前英日間的利害衝突。—特别是棉織物市塲的爭奪。—較之戰前的英德關係還更　　惡劣。就說美國罷。廣田外交的敷衍政策也祇能在極短時間内利用一下。兩國在太平洋的對峙形勢根本本無從調和。日本所以不敢貿然對蘇俄挑戰一方面固然因爲内部布置尙未妥貼。一方面則未始非受英美消極的牽制不過雙方旣已劍㧞弩張。躍躍欲試最後的戰禍恐仍難倖免。試看蘇聯海參崴要塞的漏夜趕造。飛行塲的積極開闢。和日軍在大興安嶺黑河等處的布防。對於我國内蒙新疆邊境的窺探。皆足證明前言之不謬。</p>
<p>在最後大爆烈的事變急激醖釀期中。我國縱已受盡了磨折。嘗盡了苦難。</p>
<p>仍得困心衡慮的苦幹下去。我們應該認識國際現勢。充滿了自信力。凖備應</p>
<p>付那行將蒞臨的非常時期中的「非常時。」那樣纔能排除萬難殺出一條</p>
<p>血路。</p>

<p>軍部政策又勝利</p>
<p>對華將轉趨積極</p>
<p>陸軍大臣林銑十郎辭職、表面的原因、是他的弟弟白上佑吉因受賄判罪、他感着責任重大而辭職、但實際上並不這様簡單、固然、林銑十郎爲保持他自已軍人政治家的風格、不能不表示辭職、不過這回林大將提辭表、却有一個日本内閣空前未有的奇蹟、就是他提辭表時、并未推薦後任陸相、</p>
<p>照日本内閣組織歴來的習慣、陸相是有特殊權力的、他算是政黨内閣中的一員、但並不與政黨内閣同進退、他的來源、不是由政黨組閣時推薦而是由陸軍三首領（卽參謀總長·敎育總監·陸軍大臣）會商結果、向内閣首班推薦、内閣總理絶無拒絶的權限、或商酌更换的餘地、齋籐實内閣是各黨混合内閣、他自已又是海軍界的大先輩、在海軍方面、似乎不至於發生問題、陸軍方面却使他頭痛了、這次陸相辭職、其所持理由很正大、態度很堅决、假使眞辭的話、呌内閣確是爲難到極點、因爲後任陸相該於現任陸相辭職時提出、但竟未提出、如此擱下去、會使現内閣窘死了、</p>
<p>這次陸相辭職、内幕中還有種種的複雜關係、第一、就是今年開年以來、軍閥和財閥的鬭爭異常激烈、從滿鐡改組問題、延至於内政外交、特别是對美·對英·與對華·的外交關係、而對蘇聯、也是其中之一、不過日本對蘇備戰、早已爲財閥所公同承認的、祗有其他的外交關係、尤其是對華、在財閥方面、主張和緩外交、主張經濟的親善、在軍閥方面、則以爲當以軍事需要爲本位、外交該跟着軍事爲轉移、卽對英美、亦應如是、第二、是軍部當中的中級幹部、力主强硬政策的繼續施行、萬不能讓其他各國、挿足於中國、也不能讓中國傾向於親英·美第三、牠看見中國始終接近國聯、如技術合作之類、還有銀公司、還有航空的發展、都有國際的綜錯關係·特别是般空爲日本所恐懼的一着、所以軍部方面、要政府有具體而確切的表現、强硬政策的表現、否財、軍部就將有與内閣不合作的舉動、不推薦後任陸相、卽其一端、所以自本月十一日林陸相辭職、内閣卽非常恐慌、財政資本家也很不安、各政黨也覺着將有大難臨頭的様子、假使没有調解的方法、無論是荒木再任陸相、甚而至於實現軍人内閣、則所謂立憲政治、就會要從此壽終正寢、財閥就完全到軍人底下去討生活了、所幸齊藤内閣曲意彌縫、林銑十郎經參謀總長的温慰之後、决定復任撤回辭表、到本月十八日、卽由外務部發表非正式聲明、表示他要獨占中國市塲和東亞門羅主義的意思、外務部發表這個聲明、最主要的原因、是在鎭服内部的不平、同時是借此窺探美國和英國的態度如何、在軍部的意見、還是支持其歴來的傳統思想、認爲美國正在經濟恐慌中掙扎、英國喘息初定、没有餘力、蘇聯也决不會帮助中國、歐洲本身、也正在多事之秋、更無暇東顧、乘此時機去壓迫中國、攫取整個的市塲、至少也可以挾制華北、這是很有利的一個辦法、可是在政府方面、却有兩種凖備、一種是順應軍部的要求、同時要堅固財閥的陣綫、一種是審察國際間的空氣、還是繼續努力於聯美運動、使美國諒解日本的立塲、并凖備海軍平等比率的要求、以爲將來交换的地步、究竟這種聲明還是序幕、正劇還在將來呢、（四月十九日於東京）</p>

<p>在上週讀書問答［釋疑］一篇何做法的問題。因那不屬於讀書問答的範圍，所以决定把它放在本欄討論。</p>
<p>讀書報告的性質，可以分成二種：一是讀書計劃的實現報告；一是讀了某本書後所作的報告。前者的内容是㈠讀書是否照原定計劃進行？中途是否有變更？㈡如没有實現，爲什麽？如有變更，又爲什麽？㈢讀書計劃所開各項，實現了多少？那些是做了？那些是没有做？㈣讀書計劃内所選讀的書籍是否適合？時間結配置是否够用？㈤讀書計劃實現的成績是否滿意，是否逹到了原來目的？如不滿意，述不滿意的理由，並及今後改良的方針。後者則是［</p>
<p>書後］之類的東西，在這種報告裹應當說及的是：㈠閲讀共化費了多少時間？是每日規定讀若干時間或更換，還是一氣讀完的？閲讀過程中是否間斷過？㈡對於那本書是否能了解？如不了解，是什麽緣故？是文字的不好，譯筆晦澀，抑是内容艱深不昜領悟？㈢像這樣的書讀過幾本？這本書的内容與以前年讀過的有什麽分别？那一本好？㈣個人對於那本書裹的印象如何？得到了多少知識？對於它的批評。以上不過簡單的提出幾個做報告的原則，讀者如有更好的，詳細的内容，儘可自由做去，不必拘拘於這幾條，更希望能提示我們較好的做法，使我們再轉供其他讀書參考。</p>
<p>還有，報告的性質雖稍有不同，做時却可合攏成一個。因爲凡有讀書計劃者，除非没有實現計劃，否則總是讀計劃中的一些書籍的。做綜合的報告時，除了把全計劃的實現作一個總的檢查外，將各項目的研究分開來叙述，再把讀物報告挿進去，這樣，較之作二個報告是更要醒目，更要完整些了。</p>
<p>讀者諸君，快點做報告！因爲做了報告，伐們能够益自愓勵，鼓舞起讀書的興趣。</p>
<h3 id="c200">本週情報 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>在上週裏我們很欣慰地有幾件事值得向諸君報告：　　㈠讀者來函督促我們從速成立讀書會的信，迄今巳有一百二十餘封，有一位吳立元君更具體地提出一個詳細計劃，可惜那計劃很長，不能抄錄，現在把他的要點摘出。</p>
<p>㈡組織過程│由本部負召集这責，召請諸君參加，以後會務由大家自已來。</p>
<p>㈢讀書會的目的是研究學術，相互得到切磋讀書方法。所以不宜成立一個很範統的讀書會，應當按照程度，學力，興趣，科目，分成若干小的組織。照吳君的意見，可分成三種：Ａ各科演講會，這是爲對於某種學科尙未具根底的人而設的，在這會裏有系統的講演，讀物的介紹，讀書疑難的解答。Ｂ學術同題座談會，這是由學力較高及對於某種問題有相當興趣的人成立的，這個會由大家選定題目，製成討論大綱，然後開會自由研究。Ｃ讀書談話會，這最自由，無一定的講題，每次開會由大家自由討論談話。</p>
<p>吳君的這種辦法。本部雖不定能完全照辦，却認爲極可寳貴，故轉逹於大家，不知諸君以爲何如，希望能多多檢出具體意見。</p>
<p>㈡本週許多讀者紛紛親自來館詢問和預定讀書問答集；外埠函問甚至附足郵票購買的來信，也有五六十封。現在我們特做一個總的答覆，告關心它的人們。這書定價三角，歸本報特種發行部發行，現已校樣，凖五月初出版。初販僅三千册，恐祇能在本埠銷行，所以外埠讀者如需購閲，請從速函該處預訂。</p>
<p>㈢讀者們時時催促的自學業書，在本月底也可付印了。</p>
<h3 id="c201">信箱 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>讀者諸君：</p>
<p>㈠我們發出的調查表，大部分都能很快地塡就寄來，我們非常欣慰；但是因爲讀者們讀書如此誠懇，希望也就更奢，│極盼寄出的調查表，能完全收回。故把截止期展至五月一日，讀者諸君，千萬不要使我們失望。　　㈡諸君通訊處變更，望卽通知本部。</p>
<p>㈢希望參加讀書指導的人，如在本埠，一定要先加入圖書館，取得借書證。</p>
<p>周漢楨，胡孔承，沈楓，張新生，金圖書諸君鑒：請示通訊處，以便函覆。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>當然，我後來也並不曾奏明給太后知道。但是我知道他們實在是受不慣這種約束，因爲在平常行駛任何一列火車的時候，這種種約束都是絕對没有的。第一不舒服的便是頭上的朝帽，和身上的錦袍；第二便是無論怎樣辛苦，不准坐下，第三，爲着怕要驚擾太后起見，不論碰到何種情形，絕對禁止鳴汽笛或敲鐘。</p>
<p>還有那些司閘夫是怎樣工作的呢？</p>
<p>當然，他們是不准走上這些黄色的車輛來的。更不許在這些車的頂上跑過：！如果這樣，至少就得殺頭。│那末，當這列車進了一個車站，要停歇的時候，這些人怎樣能上那末一節黄色車上去，使用手閘呢？這問題看去似乎很難解决，但是事實上倒並不難。因爲這列車的速度，自始至終，只有每小時十五英里或二十英里，│大槪是十六英里，所以在須要停車之前，司機必先派一個人從機關車上跳下去，奔到煤水車後面的半輛車上去，│這車輛並不漆黄色，乃是專供車上的工役安歇的。│知照司閘夫預備閘車。同時，司機便把速率漸漸减低，並預定這列車應停靠的地步；車行漸漸慢了，司閘夫便跳下車來，奔到後面裝着那座手閘機的車上去，或是站在地上，等後面的車行過來才跳上去，隨卽使用手閘，很穏妥地把車閘住。可是在事實上，司閘夫畢竟已跨上了黄色的車輛，也就是已經違犯了太后的命令：不過因爲他們跳上跳下跳得很快，太后也就不注意了。（一八）</p>
<h3 id="c203">寒山寺 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>［月落烏啼霜滿天，江楓漁火對愁眠。姑蘇城外寒山寺，夜半鐘聲到客船。］蘇州的寒山寺，因張繼的這首詩，居然名馳海外，成爲蘇州著名的一處名勝古跡。　　實際上，寒山寺是不足滿遊客慾望的。一所供着［寒山拾得］的大殿，旣没有莊嚴巍峨的金身佛像，空空然，露出寒山的寒酸模樣。那詠之詩歌的那隻鐘樓，小得使人無廻旋餘地，并且那隻黑黝黝的古鐘，據說早爲日人換去，已非當年故物。康聖人南海，曾爲此事大發年騷，做了一首追悼的七言詩。說：［鐘聲已渡海洋東，冷盡寒山古寺楓；莫使豐干及饒呑，使人再不到空空。］因此我有許多朋友，大半乘興而往，敗興而歸。</p>
<p>寒山寺最足使人留連的所在，是一所望江山樓，那幾間樓上，窗明几凈，那窗外的吳山，嵐影峯光，飛上樓頭，使人戀戀不捨，竉辱俱忘！這樓在民國初元，由蘇督程德全捐資興建，後來程德全遁跡空門，這樓也隨之崩潰，去年由惠心可區長募捐重建，方才恢復舊觀，這也是寒山寺的小小滄桑啊！</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>［破產］，［不景氣］，成了一般人的口頭禪了。在同一個都市裹呢，却又不絕的開出銀行來。銀行，還了得，脚上穿頂鞋，身上背雨傘，花布包的鄉下人，都能不假思索地知道是最有錢的一種機關。銀行旣一家一家開出來，而一般人兀是嚷着［不景氣］，［經濟破產］，眞不知打從怎裹說起。</p>
<p>從表面上看，似乎確是矛盾到了透頂。但是仔細一想，或許確是一個絕大的危機。該錢的，就靠該的錢周轉，才能收漁人之利。如今市面這麽的不行，誰還高興利用該錢大老的錢，去幹毫無把握的事業。該錢大老有錢没人要，於是乎把投資於銀行事業，做一個出路。</p>
<p>其實，就是開銀行，也未見得有怎麽大的希望。瞧哪，一切銀行，都在那裹學飯館出賣［另拆盌菜］的辦法，做［信用小借欵］的買賣。不，其實還不能說是［另拆盌菜］，簡直是［經濟客飯了。］　　留學生，或是說得實際些，就說大學畢業生罷，就是窮極無聊，而坐一條冷板凳，那至少也該在中學校裏執敎鞭，才說得過去。但是，中學校裏擠不進，而屈就小學敎師，那不是大材小用，而且是很可憐的麽？銀行舉辦［信用小借欵］，也就是這一個情形。</p>
<p>因此，我們該承認一般人的口頭禪，－－不景氣］，［經產破產］，着實有道理。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十七回　閨怨暗中消息慈懐可感　閒愁醉後起舊事難忘</p>
<p>兩個國家。爲了爭生存，甲國花了許多軍費去侵略乙國，乙國不得已，也花了許多軍費來抵抗甲國。設若兩方面都不花這筆錢，爲人類謀生存，豈不直接而又簡單？而况戰爭也未必能解决生存問題，歐戰以前不得了的國家，固然依舊不得了。就是可以自給的國家，到了戰後，也恐慌起來了。世界上的大政治家，大軍事家，大科學家，文學家，他們的見解，都必定超過我若干倍，何以他們不考慮這一點？也許我的程度，還不够了解戰爭的意味何在？積之設着許多疑問，來爲難自已，却是一點也答覆不出來。想久了，酒氣上升，很覺得口渴，於是又在廚房裹找來一壼開水，泡了一壼濃茶，將火鍋子收拾過去了，自已便改着捧了一壷滾茶，來繼續他的幻想。他繼續的想着，像我這樣一個人，對於戰爭，還不能十分滿意，何以楊桂枝和别的女子不同，却嫁了這樣一個出征塞外的趙自强？若說他是爲了虚榮，他以前要嫁我的時候，却再三的表示着，貧賤是不成問題，而且還怪我只重看了飯碗，輕看了愛情，没有脫離家庭壓迫的勇氣。這樣看起來，他决不爲了趙自强是個連長，才嫁他的，這裏面也許另有原因。你只看他在結婚以後五天，丈夫就出門去了，他能安之若素，這實在是看重了愛情，我讀的書，絕對的比趙自强多，見解也比趙自强高一等，可是我不如他能得桂枝的歡心。（三六九）</p>
<h3 id="c206">黄牆脚 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 天乎</p>
<p>某天，和一個西友在馬路上走，他看見路旁的小便處，像感慨似的說：［中國人的能力不弱，從這塊黄牆脚可以看出。］</p>
<p>這位西友後來向我聲明，說他說這句話，絕不含諷剌的意味，實在是從眞實的感覺把這句話推出口來了，他說以你的智力，定能把我的話理會。我聽了雖然明白了他的眞意，可是我終覺接不上口，以後的談話也只好把别的話又開了　　我雖然没有到過外國，我想外國决不有這種黄牆脚的情形吧？僅有的，或許只有我們貴國，才有這種劣根性的表現。</p>
<p>在馬路上，覺得下部有些膨脹，可以隨時隨地拉開褲襠下方便一，這不能不承認是我們的特色，而且在方便之時，絕没有雅相不雅相的觀念，横堅一般把這名稱呌的很文雅，喚作大便小便，於是就成了無往而不便的風氣了。</p>
<p>所以和朋友一起在路上走，可以隨便而便，更有下面各便其便，上面大談特談，餘滴將盡，揮搖有致，這般風韵，也許只有我們貴同胞才得享受吧？</p>
<p>所可惜者，從黄牆脚的情形，就昭示中國人是超赿自由之外的民族，而把許多時看作具文的劣根性更重，例是［不准小便］的揭示之下，却是［此處可便上一便的潛意識，巳成爲普遍的心理了。］</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>大槪是幾年前了，淮安　　縣曾經發生過這樣一件趣事：有一個某軍閥手下的副官，因爲頭髮長了，特地跑到理髮店裏去修剪，恰巧這位理髮師不知道想什麽窮心思，一個大意，竟把這位副官的鬍鬚剃去了。在軍閥時代的軍人，本來是鷄蛋裹找骨頭，没事還要找事的，何况這是理由充足，正大光明，自然要大發雷霆了。當時理髮店裏老　，看見理髮師已經在太歲頭上動了土；老虎嘴上捋了鬚；也就惶恐萬狀，百般的討饒，並且挽出有面子的人出來調解。最後，纔以四百六十元送給這位副官，纔算子事。揚州有一句笑話，呌做［一根鬍子五斗米］，算起來這位副官的鬍子，或還不止一根換五斗米呢。</p>

<p>三·紅絲硯</p>
<p>紅絲硯的價值紅絲硯石出山東青州，唐錄稱：［石工蘇懐玉言，州西四十里，山盤折而上，五百餘步，有洞狭容一人。洞前大石欹懸，石生於洞之兩壁，上下青赤，石數重中，有紅黄色如絲，洞口絕壁，鐫有唐中和年採石所記八大字，蘇工當時得石四五寸，携歸加以磨治，文華緻，聲清赿，墨奮浮泛，蒸濡如露，異於他石，一日洞門石摧，遂絕。］以後歷宋元以迄明清，屢次發掘，從無佳石發現。至清季，日本近衛公出售寳物，中有唐代遺使時所得紅絲石猿面古硯，以二萬數千金出讓，於是和田豐次等一般愛硯之徒，震於紅絲石之名，乃電託青島鐵道技師小川博士，調查紅絲石坑原處。小川卽分派多人，四出探訪，均不知其處。時坂東氏在青島，亦邀青島硯友十餘人，轉輾探悉紅絲石發現處，乃按圖索驥，至則唐代原坑，巳封禁開採，且洞口危石重疊，無從着手，乃由下方設法採掘，得紅絲石數塊，都滑不發墨，後又悉距青州西六七里處有墨山，約高五六百尺，上有一小廟，名紅絲廟，旁隠有一洞，洞口石上，書有紅絲洞字樣。入口處爲土石所掩，集工將土石掘開，卽見有七八十丈之廣塲，洞内土赤潮濕，四邊皆巖石，掘以試之，皆粗礪。後連掘三日夜，僅得尺餘石塊數方，雖較潤澤，然無鋩，故亦滑不發墨，由此可知前人之所以封採者，卽因無佳石故也。出石愈少，故愈重視，唐彥猷以紅絲石有脂脈，助墨光，稱爲天下第一。蔡君謨稱紅絲發墨勝於端，東坡雖謂爲過甚，然當時士大夫皆一致盛稱之。晃叔用詩，銀釣灑落桃花牋，牙牀磨諓紅絲硯，汪彥章銘，餐霞道士赤膚肌，隠然脈絡亂紅絲，千齡不敗堅且滋，誰其忍者斷厥尸，可見當時紅絲硯之價值，實不在洮河綠石之下也。</p>

<h3 id="c246">小說與隨筆 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>根本上恐怕也是由於生活空虚之故，現在中國的小說作家，大抵力求奇警，取材，結構，造句，選詞，莫不如是。據我看，這又是多少受了日本文學的影響所致。日本也没有偉大的文學，而其實也因爲它的國民没有充實的生活，然而他們是乖巧不過的，所以在到處賣弄着小聰明。顯露在他們的文與上的特色，也是奇警。這只要一看周作人先生所譯的「現代日本小說集」就可知道。中國則不但文與深受了日本文與的影響，就是普通的文章，也很多日本化之處。本來内容空處的東西，加上一點奇警，就有了刺激性，使好奇者也能相當地滿足。這正如精神肉體完全墮落的女人穿上一套摩登衣服一様。</p>
<p>小說和隨筆的區别，在這里也存在着。小說家觀察人生，單觀某種特殊的形相是不够的；他的眼睛應當看到更全體，更根本，更普遍的地方繼對，其表現當然也該這様。隨筆作家則否，他往往漫興地只看到極微的一點，卽用警句寫了出來。但在寫作之際，隨筆作家是明明知道自已的空虚的，也是明明將這告白於讀者之前的。否則，他也要不自量地寫小說了。所以，對於不能寫小說而只寫隨筆的作家，批評家們於嗤美他們的空虚淺薄之際，還當原諒他們的忠實之處。</p>
<p>不幸，我們的小說家，也苦於生活的空虚了，但更苦的，是生活雖然空虚而仍得寫小說。寫小說而没有更全體，更根本，更普遍的人生的題材可寫怎麽辦呢？總得呌人喜歡看些，於是不得不隨筆化∶力求奇警。所以雖是用第一人稱叙述一個極平凡的故事麽，但只要中間有一二警句，也就成其爲小說了。</p>
<p>穆木天先生所指出的「小說隨筆化」的問題，確實是很重大的。但要「防禦」這傾向，「我們」是没有辦法的。因爲這旣然根本由於作家「生活的空虚」，那麽除了說作家們自已竭力充實他」</p>
<p>們的生活之外，「我們」何能爲力呢？</p>
<p>同時，我還希望「隨筆」也不要盡是「容易的文學」。生活充實的作家，未嘗不可以搏獅子之力寫隨筆的。說「散文隨筆」定是「貴族或士大夫層的産物」，也有些過火。報告文學的價值倘不爲我們的批評家所抹煞，則其性質，實與隨筆，Ｆｅｉｌｌｅｔｏｎ之類很近的。</p>
<p>至於术天先生所說某一雜誌編輯的問題∶「近來有些東西簡直分不出是小說還是散文。」則很易解决，那些東西，總不外乎兩類：一類定是散文，一類則旣非小說亦非散文。</p>

<p>— 郁逹夫</p>
<p>吃過午飯，我們由方丈陪伴，就大家上了西面高處的分經臺。臺荒寺壤，現在只變了一個小小的茅篷。分經臺西側，行五十餘步，更有一個葛稚川的煉丹池，池上有茅篷一，修道僧一。到了分經臺，大家的遊興似乎盡了，但我與金籛甫，吴實基，徐成章三位先生，更發了痴性，一定想窮源探底，上一上這東天目的極頂。因爲志書上說，西天目高三千五百丈，東天目高三千九百丈，一置身在東天目頂，就可以把浙江半省的山川形勢，看得澈底零清，旣然到了這十分之八的分經臺上，那又誰肯舍此一簣之功呢！和方丈及同來的諸先生别去後，我們只帶了一位寺裹的工人作響導，斬荆披棘，渡石懸厓，在荒凉的草樹業中，泥沙道上，走了兩個鐘點，方纔走到了那一座東天目絕頂的大仙峯上。据陪我們去的那一位工人說，仙峯絕頂，常有雲霧罩着，一年中無幾日清。數年前，山中樹各大數圍，直連至山頂，故虎豹猴兒之屬，都棲息其間。後爲野火所焚，全山成焦土，後此後，虎豹絕跡，而林木亦絕。我們聽了他的話，心裏倒也有點兒害怕。因爲火焼之後，大樹雖只剩了許多枯幹，直立在山頭，但焼不盡的茅草，野竹之類，已長得有一人身高，虎豹之類，還儘可以藏身。爬過二仙峯後，地下盡是暗水，草業中濕得像在溪邊一様，工人說，這是上面龍潭裏流出來的水，雖大旱亦不涸。爬得愈高，空氣也愈稀薄，因之大家都急喘得厲害；到了仙緣石上，四面的景色一變，我們四人的興致，於是更勃發了起來。</p>
<p>這仙緣石，是大仙峯龍潭下的一塊數百丈寛廣的大石。奇形怪狀的岩壁洞窟，不計其數。仙緣石頂，正當那一座峭壁之下，就是龍潭。雖係石壁中小小的一方清水，但溢流出去，却能助成東西兩瀑布的飛沬銀濤，鄉下人的要視此爲神，原也不足怪了。並且東山志上，還記有昔人曾在此石上遇仙的故事，故而後而後人題詩，有將此石比作劉阮的天台的。但我們却旣不見龍，又不遇仙，只在仙綠石東首的一塊像獅子似的岩石上那株老松－－這松樹也眞奇怪，大火時並未焚去－－－－之下，坐了許多時候。山風清辣，山氣沈寂，在這孤松下坐着息着，舉目看看蒼空斜日，和周圍的萬壑千岩，雖則不能仙去，各人的肚裏，却也廻腸盪氣，有點兒飄飄然像喝醉了酒。</p>
<h3 id="c248">周作人先生的自壽詩 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>－從孔融到陶淵明的路</p>
<p>人間世刋載周作人先生五十自壽詩，引起了許多批評；詩是好的，批評也是對的。</p>
<p>周先生家中傳說謂周先生前身係一老僧：周先生亦自謂夢中曾得一詩：「偃</p>
<p>息禪堂中，沐浴禪堂外，動止雖有殊，心閑故無礙。」前世出家，「確鑿有據。」周先生近年恬淡生涯，與出家人相隔一閒、以古人相衡，心境最與陶淵明相近。朱晦庵謂「隠者多是帶性負氣之人，」陶淵明淡然物外，而所嚮往的是田子泰，荊軻一流人物，心頭的火雖在冷灰底下，仍是炎炎燃焼着。周先生自新文學運動前綫退而在苦兩齋談狐說鬼，其果厭世冷觀了嗎？想必炎炎之火仍在冷灰底下燃焼着，前些時，周先生與俞平伯先生書謂：「又見中學生吾家予同講演，以不佞爲文學上之一派，鄙見殊不以爲然，但此尙可以說見仁見智；唯云不佞尙保持五四前後的風度，則大誤矣。一個人的生活態度時時有變動，安能保持十三四年之久乎？不佞自審近來思想益消沉耳，豈尙有五四時浮躁凌厲之氣乎？」由「浮躁凌厲」而「思想消沉」，旁人眼裏，當然恍如隔世了。</p>
<p>這條思想變遷的途徑，可以名之爲「從孔融到陶淵明的路」。</p>
<p>建安文人中孔融是憤　世的，眼裏看不慣，嘴裏總愛說出來，他愛和吾家孟德頂撞，抓孟德的癢處，終於爲吾家孟德所殺。和孔融同輩的，如彌衡，楊修，落在同一的命運。稍後一些時，司馬一家當權，做人格外難了：阮籍傳所謂「屬魏晋之際，天下多故，多士少有全者。」因此，一般知識分子只好麻醉自已的靈魂，餘酒服藥以苟全性命。有如阮籍「不與世事，酣餘爲常。鍾會數以時事問之，欲因其可否而致之罪，皆以酣醉獲兒。」然而何宴嵇康還不能自免，連自已麻醉也不行。再往後一些時，佛家思想流行起來，一切憤火都平熄下來；出世觀代替了入世觀，知識分子都變成陶淵明一路人物了。周先生在五四時代的思想，已不待說。民國十五年，周先生看見孫傳芳在九江斬决了五十名學生的消息，有信致持光先生，說；「持光兄，</p>
<p>今天在燕大圖書館看見英文報說，孫傳芳在九江斬决了五十名學生，又某地將十名學生判决死刑云，我不禁想起希臘悲觀詩人巴拉逹思的一首小詩來。（原詩從路）那詩大意云，我們都被看管，被餵養著，像是一羣猪，給死神隨意地宰殺。－－不過死神是異物，人不能奈何他。人把人當猪看待，却是令人駭然，雖然古時曾有人彘的典故。」</p>
<p>其憤然之情見於言表。但從那回经後，閉戶讀書論，唖吧禮讚出來了，除了在女子學院被囚記以外，我們不再見浮躁凌厲之氣的文字了。周先生備歴世變，甘於韜藏，以隠士生活自全，蓋勢所不得不然，周先生十餘年間思想的變遷，正是從孔融到陶淵明二百年間思想變遷的縮影；我們讀了自壽詩，更可以明白了！</p>
<p>「附啓」</p>
<p>語堂先生，</p>
<p>周先生自壽詩，用吉六宣紙恭寫，</p>
<p>着蘇州裱工精裱，懸掛林氏書齊齋，彼此欣賞欣賞，此法最妥，而且省了許多是非。何如？</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>亡妻的倩影，又明顯地映在他的心頭，他爲自已辦解，這再度的結婚，並不能算是對於她的忘情，假如她能明白自已的苦衷，也不會苛責他吧！</p>
<p>從那天以後，在孩子的心中，常常想到那新的媽媽了。大的孩子聽說過表姊的後母待她十分兇惡，表姊常常在暗地裏流涙的，他同學中間也有幾個是有後母的，他們都說後母對待他們不好，所以他心裏十分疑惑。他想，麗姑會不會待他們不好呢？麗姑會不會和人家的後母一様，常常責駡他們，不許他們吃好的東西，不許他們快活呢？可是爸爸說麗姑一定十分愛自已的。那麽麗姑會不會和自已的媽媽一様，抱着妹妹，愛撫着自已，唱着軟軟的催眠曲？有時媽媽做了很好的點心，分給他們，媽媽很生氣的時候，也從没把他打駡過的。　　母新死後，孩子慢慢把忘了，現在爸爸說要有新的媽媽，那麽對於自已媽媽的懷念，比她剛死時更加深了起來，也是第一次覺得没有了媽媽的悲痛呢！</p>
<p>「哥，麗姑幾時來做我們的媽媽呢！」一次妹妹問他。</p>
<p>「我不知道呀！」</p>
<p>「她和我們的媽媽一様的嗎？」</p>
<p>「我也不知道呀！」</p>
<p>妹妹向哥哥看了一眼，生氣地跑開去了。</p>
<p>他眞的也想問問爸爸，麗姑幾時來做他們的母親呢；可是幾次要問，到底没有問過，因爲他覺得爸爸不是先前一様的爸爸了。爸爸不再帶着孩子氣一様的高與，跟他談這個，談那個，他温書的時候，爸爸也不時常看着他，問他許多問題。雖然爸爸仍舊那麽和氣快樂，說話却不像先前一様多了，常常把他呆看好一會，他不明白爸爸爲什麽變成了這個様子。</p>
<p>本來，父親每天在媽媽的照像面前，要换一束鲜花的，這事情，父親决不要女僕代做，父親每天親手把一束鲜花挿在瓶裏，把那束花放得父親以爲好看了才滿意。並且那瓶子，他也看見父親換過三個了。父親對他說過的，媽媽在世候的時，最喜歡把一切傢具收拾得好看，也常常喜歡把屋子裏佈置的式様變換，所以父親有了更好看的花瓶，就要給媽媽換過。但這幾天來，父親不再每天給媽媽換鲜花了，起先那束鲜花謝後，陸媽對父親說丢了吧，於是丢了，便没有再挿進去過。父親屢次對他們說過的：「你們無論什麽時候，總不要忘記了媽媽啊！」但是，爸爸不是先忘了嗎？他想。本來，每隔三個星期，父親總帶着他們到公墓上去，看看媽媽葬着的日子，公墓離家裏不怎麽遠，所以他們一方面去看媽媽，一方面便趁此散步，昨天也是該去的日子，爸爸却說有緊要的事，改到下星期去吧！這事情，妹妹最生氣，她盼望了好久的一次散步，却給爸爸阻止住了。</p>

<p>然而他們一壁這様熱烈地擴充着軍備，一壁郤又派了許多戴高帽子和白手套的「紳士」們在日内瓦會商着裁軍，這，這眞可謂極善忘的能事了！　　所謂裁軍會議，已有兩年多的歴史了從一九三二年二月到現在，牠究竟做了些什麽呢？誰也不能回答這個問題。我們只知道單是去年一年，這會議化費了三十五萬萬的金鎊，這眞是一個驚人的浪費！此外，一些「備忘錄」和「照會」大約也可堆積成山了。</p>

<p>但是，「備忘錄」儘像雪片様的多，帝國主義的列强他們的記憶力郤並不因此而有些微的增進。他們只是計劃着怎様可以增進自國軍隊的力量，他們的所</p>
<p>謂裁軍，只是希望裁别國的軍，而自已國家的軍隊是應當獨存的。誠如　伯訥說··「他們甚至也不假說要裁軍，他們只希望能够想出較便宜的方法，在日内瓦，他們只是這様互相談論着··『唔，十六英寸的砲彈，實在比十英寸的貴得多。我想把十六英寸的砲彈换了十英寸來擊你，你道如何？』軍縮會議的成功，是完全建築這種意義上面的。</p>
<p>這様，要望裁軍會議成功，簡直是痴人說夢。</p>
<p>要實行軍縮，顯然非會議所能成功，也不是什麽「備忘綠」「照會」所能奏效，拉迭克說得好··</p>
<p>「現在只有一種條約還有訂立的可能，卽列强用以代替國聯來商量葬送」軍縮會議而爲新的軍備消滅困難的條約。</p>

<h3 id="c275">「迷」之爲害 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>有人說··人生在世不過是一個迷。不錯，正因爲它是一個迷，所以我們就需要去揭破這個迷，蓋迷之爲害最大。我們在這裏可以舉出社會上的各種迷爲例證，先知迷之害，才知道有去揭破這個迷的人生之必要。</p>
<p>迷神—宗敎我說他是一種内心修養的工具。耶蘇說··何悔改了就可以得救。佛說也有這様的敎訓··善人善報，惡人惡報。佛與耶蘇的意思都是希望世人不要犯罪和做惡事。可是他們經過年長月積的傳說之後，却當佛與耶蘇都是活神，能治百症。甚至自稱文明，比較進化的宗敎，耶蘇敎也還有這種迷信的現狀。你看，他們的兒子病重了，他們不請醫生，只是跪在孩子的床前祈禱，相信耶蘇會救活他們無罪的孩子，到了兒子活不得，死了的時候，他們就說是耶蘇的意思要他們的兒子上天堂享福。這顯明可以看出迷之害，他們不迷信耶蘇能救孩子的生命，不是可以由醫生用藥替他治愈了嗎？所以耶蘇敎若是拚命的向農村無知識的人們傳播下去，使他們無理由的迷信，我相信世界的人口增减問題將受其影響。</p>
<p>女人迷—我們不能不承認社會上有一班女人迷。他們有妻子··不够，他們還有姨太太，姨太太由號數零起至於八十六號··不够，他們還有情婦，婊子，舞伴，這都是他們天天要去密會的；由此，以個人有限的精神，迷緊在女人的範圍當中，於是他對於自已的妻子没有純潔的愛，没有敎飬的責任心，同時他們的金錢也完全糟埸乾凈。這是迷爲害之第二點實證。</p>
<p>此外還有運動迷，謮書迷，戲迷，賭迷，酒迷。運動迷的人多數是學校的學生，他們不知謮書只知運動，將來從學校舉業出來（以運動的成績優越而得</p>
<p>特准舉業者）他們想在社會謀事業，可是自已要寫情書給愛人亦得哀求朋友代筆，自已然他們是不易找着一個適合的社會位置，他們有的只是一點力和兩條長而粗赤的大腿，那麽去當碼頭工人吧，他們却是光明正大的學士，誰料到弄到現在文不能武不做！我敢在這裏說一句．．他們和一匹黄牛没有什麽兩様，受着農夫的指揮，在空塲田野跑其幾百米是可以的。謮書迷的人也有壤的地方，本來多讀書是最好的，可是一迷了，就有害於健康。戲迷，賭迷，酒迷者是把金錢，精神都同時損失了，這也都是迷之過失。</p>
<p>說完上面這許多迷，我還覺得有一個迷是不可不說的，這個迷是什麽迷呢？是最時行的迷，我說它就是官迷。做官之念不知道什麽時候已經侵入了每個青年的腦心當中，尤其是到了大學時代，他們都不是好的在學校裏面研究學問，他們日思夜想的就是打算自已離開學校之後怎様可以做官，所以大學時期變了做官的凖備時期，把好好的青年光陰都慌廢了，這確是官迷了！但，官到底有什麽好做呢？自然，這都是我國歴來的官輩給了他們的版様，官自來都是有錢的，不但錢是任所欲而有，權勢亦任所欲而施，故此做官豈不是一件痛快事？誰不願也威風一下呢？</p>
<h3 id="c276">禁娼問題 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>我們知道社會上之所以會有娼妓存在者，并非偶然，而是由於這畸形的社會經濟組織所孕育出來的這是誰也不能够否認的。雖然摩根ＬｅｗｉｓＨ·Ｍｏｒｓａｎ以爲「娼妓制度是過去投來的陰影，却落在現在的家庭生活上」。或者說．．「娼妓制度大約是古代辭交的殘餘，或者象徴的回憶」。至於這娼妓制度之應該廢除，却是被認爲社會問題中重要的一個課題，而過去，在全世界各個都市中，都嘗經被提出消極的廢除或積極的禁止過，可是，結果祇是枉然！因爲在社會經濟組織没有經過新的變革而確立時，這禁絕娼妓的問題，是絶對不能得到了圓滿的解决的啊！不意國際聯盟竟在失意於中日問題的解决之後，慒然地提出＿而且是「决定」了「禁絕全球娼妓」這一議案。</p>
<p>日内瓦十一日國民電··</p>
<p>「國聯决將全球之娼寮一律禁絶。····其所根據之報吿書中，詳述世界各大埠之官娼私妓，幾無處無之。此種不正當之營業，各當局如不發執照，則自不難禁止。···或以爲禁娼之後，如彼等改頭换面，則勢必反致無法稽查。然如於禁娼後，而能各予以正當之職業，則彼等　自不難成爲良民云」。</p>
<p>這麽一張「官塲文章」，表面上看起來，倒還詞嚴，氣壯，語直，理圓；而實際上却祇是一紙「空文」吧了！因爲問題的中心，就是在於各國的當局是否能够「各予以正當的職業」，而使彼等「成爲良民」呢！</p>
<p>我們且看．．現在世界經濟恐慌的颶風在怒號着．．商業不景氣，農村破産，失業人數之激增，這世紀末的年代呵！各國的當局者都在設法東彌西補以維持其經濟基源的不暇，對千百萬在飢寒交迫中熟練的失業工人，尙無法以應付，何况對此娼妓乎？</p>
<p>但是，我們對於地球上一個新的角落裏＿蘇聯在五年計劃於四年問完成了之後的娼妓之不禁自絕，更使我們感到「各當局如不發執照，則自不難禁止」。這種治標的理論之空虚！因爲這禁娼問題，根錢過去的經　來說，實非治標所能奏效；而是需要從根本上去着想。那就是說．．如果要使全世界各大埠的娼妓絶跡，就應該先來考察一下，從古時代以來的娼妓制度形成的原因，和現社會制度下娼妓之所以存在的條件，然後才能够提出怎様禁絕娼妓的方案。</p>
<p>這裏，我們更深深地覺得．．娼妓是跟着社會組織，經濟制度而存在的，正所謂「共存共榮」哩！因此，如果要禁絕全世界的娼妓，就非把這舊的社會經濟組織離棄，而創造出新的不行哩。絕對不是國際聯盟這麽一紙「空文」所能制事的。</p>

<p>春到人間好些時候，住在都市裏的弄堂，也不看見紅的花綠的衰，也不聽見鳥的歌聲，究竟住在這裏只有氣候寒熱的感覺并没分見出春與秋的亭子間裏，是没有太陽的所在，與自然隔絕了的呵！壁上雖然掛着一些山水的畫圖，還有畫家贈我的字幅說是，「俗客不來庭户間，柴門雖設不曾關；小窗鎮日渾無事，自仿倪黄雨後山。」可是，也就只有畫圖裏頭的雨後山給我感覺到一點春意吧了。近來恰是一連幾天下了絲絲的春雨，悶煞人，而今天天晴了，於是乎很想到野外去看看春究竟眞的來了没有，便在午飯後出了門。龍華觀桃花，本來是尋春的好辦法，但想起名媛淑女紳土哥兒的尋春汽車在你的身邊擦過，你就是心不動馬地合乎新生活運動的禮義廉恥那「非禮勿視，」但也就風麽滿臉，走在馬路邊吃了一鼻子灰了。於是乎决定到江灣鄕下找朋友去，在那裏的菜畦草地當不至於尋不到春吧？俺住的是南邊要到江湾鄕下，當然是朝北而走，這南北兩端的路也就不算不遠了。掉换了幾次電車，這才到了江口公園門口，在號門外籬邊樹棄兒是綠的，望了公園裏的草兒也是綠的，可是不見一朶花兒。俺心想∶到底春是眞的來了。可是見了没有花兒的春，也就够憂鬰的了！才轉灣，向江灣前進，眼見着幾個手提來福槍的日本兵在叱咤着快跑着，下意識地感覺到禍災的來臨，立卽站住不敢前，進。那幾個日本兵左衝右突，從這邊馬路邊的電綫柱路過那邊鐵路沿的電綫柱原來是在練習巷戰。－尋春的與頭，給這一幕令人回想「一二八」戰役的慘痛的未來劇打得粉碎了，只得憂鬰地轉入市内在人的潮與車的潮裏頭躑躅去了。</p>
<p>俺心頭没有春意，就連尋春都没緣分，合該是在冰冷的陰森的亭子間裏幹那糊口的埋頭工作了，嗚呼</p>

<p>今天無意中接到青青的信，我又牽記起青青了；青青的信是這様的∶　　王先生∶你好？昨天你爲什麽在深夜裏一定要回去呢？你去了，呌我今天表演舞蹈的時候誰來替我吹口琴呢？　　王先生，你太像我死去了的大哥哥了，我從前的大哥哥也有像你一様的和氣的笑容；也像你一様的歡喜我；他也會吹得很好聽的口琴；王先生，我想呌你大哥哥，你能够答應我嗎？</p>
<p>大哥哥呀！下半年我一定要到你敎的學校裏來謮書，我眞想常常和大哥哥住在一𣵦啦！祝你</p>
<p>快活你初認識的小朋友∶青青·</p>
<p>青青在我意識裏像一朶花；一朶白的花兒·</p>
<p>前天，青青的學校裏舉行校慶游藝會；在化裝室裏，我就認識了青青·　　我刚跑進化裝室；青青就從沙發上跳了起來，穿着飄飄的跳衣；把　子　　着我，那麽可愛地笑着，笑着·　　「青青，這就是我對你們說過的王先生呀！」他們的校長這様地介紹着·　　「王先生·」青青輕輕地呌了一聲，綿羊似地挨在我的身旁∶「王先生，你眞像我的大哥哥·」</p>

<p>「好！我一邊吹，你一邊跳舞？」</p>
<p>她底底頭，笑笑∶「燕雙飛可好？「　　「好！」</p>
<p>於是，我吹起曲兒—她唱着，舞着　　··像一隻鶑黄兒。終止和時候，　飛舞似地跳在我懹里，嬌羞地說∶</p>
<p>「跳得不好！跳得不好！」</p>
<p>我暗暗地想∶「温馴的小姑娘呵！」她告訴了我許多她學校裏的事情，又告訴了我她今天表演的節目·</p>
<p>台上開幕了—逢到她舞蹈，總是我替她奏曲兒·</p>
<p>散塲的時候，夜已經是那末深了；我要回去，可是青青拖着我，哀求似地·　「王先生！你不要回去！你就在我們校裏敎書吧！」</p>
<p>「青青，這是不能够的；你牽記我，我以後常來看你好了！」我牽住　手·</p>
<p>她失望似地望着我的臉，像要哭了。</p>
<p>我把她起來，在她耳邊悄悄地說··　　「青青，你不要悲傷，你的大哥哥今晚一定要去的了。」我把青青放下來後，怱怱地走了。</p>

<p>— 麥夫</p>
<p>平日有一椿最受窘的事，便是碰着人家問及「貴庚」。</p>
<p>雖然自已並不曾說謊，事實上也無須乎把自已的年齡說青一些的必要，倒每每要大說一二歳。然而聽着的人總不相信，從那通過了疑問的表情看來，總以爲我的答案不正確。有時候竟有人這麽贊美我··「這麽年青的孩子！」這又却使我感到異樣的面熱，因爲自已知道，年紀雖然輕輕，姿態却確然有些老了，額前的折皺，面孔的苍白，都已分明的劃出了我在，人生裏的陣列。那贊美着我是年青的孩子的，無疑的是在嘲笑我。</p>
<p>說出來，今年我還僅僅二十三歲，但様子兒却顯得像三十來歲的中年了。這我原不在乎，老就老了，人生總是要老的，有甚干係！不過自已的年龄，確實還輕，而竟衰老得這麽厲害，却畢竟是使人感傷的！</p>
<p>爲什麽，我這様老了，那只有痛駡我的環境。十六年，我在家鄕害了整年的病，但却並不厲害，因爲年歲太大，一般的人家連鈑都没得吃，所以父親對我的病是非常的忽視，請個醫生看一兩次看不好，於是又歇下了，這様拖拖宕宕，以致吃藥也就很少有效騐。最後還是母親特别的奔走，籌得一筆較多的醫藥費，才不停地服藥把病消除了。然而這時身體已受了莫大的打擊，本來還只有十七歲，就看得像二十多歲的人了。　　依稀記得，十七年春正，一個堂兄弟結婚，我去閙新房，大概是閙得太過火了，惱得新娘子這様求情··「請你這位老人家休息一會！吧」眞使我氣冒得很，還僅僅十七歲，就說我是老人家，於是我更不規矩的閙得她下跪下拜。　　然而那時我的心底，究竟有着無限的感傷，爲的是青春確已在臨去向我送秋波，雖然並没有眞的成了老頭兒。　　這幾年在上海混，所過的生活，都使我不敢回憶，有時候是飽挨着窮氣，有時候是受够了狗子們的侮辱，最是二十年在Ｘ先生的手下做了整年的奴隸，去年又會整年的没有吸到空氣。也會害過幾塲不重不輕的病痛。</p>
<p>這都是斷送我的青春的根原，在這種折磨之下，我早就打算我的青年不要了，事實上也是駐留不住。</p>
<p>不過姿態雖然是有些兒老了，而心情却幸還是青春的，這，	我自已可有把握的保證。</p>
<p>只要我的心還確是青春的，我也就覺得我還是一個有救的人。是的　險惡的環境，險惡的社會，我總得給它一番　當的報答。</p>

<p>厭聽野雀語雕簷，怕見楊花撲繡簾；拈起繡針還倒拈，兩盾尖，一半兒微舒，一半兒歛。—查德卿—偶而翻到一本元曲别集，這兩首最愛不忍釋，默默地念了好幾遍，一點春心不禁大有蕩漾之勢。彷彿一個古代的　　這種戰爭是弱小民族的殊死戰爭。</p>

<p>戰爭是可怕的，但投降絕不是和平思春美人兒，從書裏姗姗而出，「笑倚玉郎嬌欲眠，」我卽以粉郎自居。　　想像不能不容我追溯到數百年以前的世紀裏。那男女關係的神秘，實是耐人尋味。幽深的閨房裏鎖着個懹春的少女，滿腹的春情無處寄放，不得已寄託到四周景物上去。花開花落，觸動了心神的一喜一愁；月圓月缺，引起了無限的想思，縷縷的爐香，喃喃的燕語，都足以使之生出羡慕，妬娭，怨尤。這時，一切都感到不自然起來··坐又不是，立又不好，只軟綿綿地，懒痒痒地，一種形容不出的情緒，任是一位善畫的藝術家，不能描幕出萬分之一。「自　花</p>
<p>三四　，絮叨叨，一半兒　眞，一半兒草。」一首確有這種神情。</p>
<p>卽使有兪情的事，也總是偷偷摸摸，所謂「月上柳梢頭，人約黄昏後」一類的事，已够幽會之精微描窵的了。至若「　擁春雲鬆玉釵，眉淡秋山幾鏡臺海棠開未開？粉郎來未來？」一首更能使我想到了深閨中人思春的一幅神秘之圓。</p>
<p>「玉人春困倚東風」終究是［實在的，至於像「滿園春色關不住，一枝紅杏出牆來」一類的事，到底能有多少？　　在這種地方，我始終偏愛神秘。人類要是到了似貓呌春般的放任自由，還有什麽意義？但是，時代的巨輪終於带着人類朝這條路上走去。衣服可以不穿，赤裸裸地你朝着我，我對着你，其名曰「回到自然，」我不信爲何没人提倡茹毛飲血，豈非更與「自然」接近？　　諸如此類的事情，眞會呌我害怕。記得某一次在一張小報上，見到這様幾句話··「女子不穿褲子，男子必要失業，」那末，現在女子尙未把褲子脫掉不穿，失業的怒潮已閙得昏天黑地，如果眞個到女子個個不穿褲子的時代，則世界上的男子必死得乾乾凈凈，但也許天下就此太平。</p>
<p>還算不幸中之大幸，時代尙未走到這一步，女子仍舊穿着褲子，男子仍舊穿着大褂子。可是，男女的神秘關係，早已消滅了，繼而起者，是肉的誘惑。不談那些「肉香四溢」「肉感消魂」吧，且看看我們日常所眼見的，必信余言之不謬。君不見「顚動的Ｘ房」幾乎要從旗袍裏跳出來，「擺動的Ｘ部」十足的撩人心絃，至於那些「體態婀娜，」「玉腿微裸，」「血紅的嘴唇，」「黑的眼皮」····等等尙其餘事耳。</p>
<p>時代的巨輪，不停地朝前轉着，不能否認，一切都在進步中。男女間的神秘，不再存在，女子的地位也提高了起來，關於婦女問題的討論眞是最時髦的事；尤其是婦女職業問題的爭論，不久以前會熱閙過一次，現在稍微平靜靜些，但是，並非問題已有解决，不過大家都累了，坐下來呷口茶，休息休息而已。不佞雖是個偏愛神秘的人，在這個時代裏，已不容有這種怪癖了，但是，肉的誘惑實在太過了度，以致有點胆寒，故想勸勸女同胞們，莫專在胭脂花粉上用功夫，尤其是寫婦女問題的幾位女士們，在寫文章之前，千萬不要忘記把臉上的脂粉先揩掉了。</p>

<h3 id="c283">中國古式橋樑建築之一斑（下） <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 朱枕木</p>
<p>（二）拱橋—卽俗稱環洞橋者是也，是爲中國獨有之特式橋梁，基於美術而言，固極美觀，而基於工程言之，亦極堅固，式様結構，而臻全美。是種拱橋之建築，不用摩太膠黏，僅以石塊搭叠而成，環洞卽爲全橋之骨架，兩面各有矮墻，兩墻之中實以淤泥碎磚，而上蓋石板，舖成階級，卽可成橋，通常拱橋之橋基，亦爲石塊，或石條，底層亦須密打木椿，木椿上密舖石塊，是卽橋墩，橋墩須高出最高潮時之水位一呎以上，方能保得橋身安全，砌矮墻之石塊，必須整齊堅固，不使漏水，砌法與平時砌磚同，平行順舖，墻之頂層，須舖以石條一根，其長度以及半橋爲佳，否則兩三條接之亦可，若砌墻之石，係屬大塊之花岡石，可不需摩太，否則可稍嵌石縫，藉資堅固而絕水，當墻中滿塡淤泥碎石等物後，卽可舖上橋面，叠成階級。又當矮墻疊砌時，近環洞之兩旁，可各柱石柱一條而對面兩條之上，復横跨石條一根，藉資鈎搭着實，不至偏欹。是種矮墻，俱有抵抗外力之功効，蓋環洞之石塊，係屬鬆接，當橋基下陷或上擠時，極易鬆落，而肇禍端，有此矮墻卽可防患，然矮墻對於外來屈撓力量不能抵抗，故必須環洞上拱，方克相擠，再者是種環洞，多爲大弧形，卽圓心高出橋墩之上者，故兩墻之剪力，所受極小，實爲極合理之建築。有時是種拱橋，以橋基橋墩之損壤，而發生傾側事情，然其矮墻環洞，若未經坍廢者，自能得其新改式樣，而仍便於交通，毫無弊病，凡各處拱橋，均可見到是種現象，實亦難能。至拱頂與橋面之距離，則無一定規例，然觀察下來，大者約爲其拱門跨度，全長之六十分之一，而小者須在其跨度全長之三十分之一以内，否則易壤。</p>
<p>（三）縣臂橋—在中國西部及西南各地，極少石條橋樑，而獨多懸臂式之橋樑，通常多建築於所需橋門跨度寛闊之處，若橋門之跨度大於一三○呎以上者，則非此式不辦矣。是故大河闊面，亦多用此種懸臂式之橋樑。建築之法，先於兩岸打椿築基，而後用長大木材，插入基内，横互斜出，如手臂之外擎然，如此支出數層，待最上一層之兩端相距不遠時，卽可舖以橋面，是種橋面，以易於調换爲宜，則可節省損壤修理之費用不少，懸臂橋之兩端接頭處橋樑，而用三夾木充任，否則恐不堪任重，或有危險發生，是種懸臂橋樑，橋門亦可增加，只須於河中另築橋基，而兩面伸出之，卽可應用。</p>
<p>（四）吊橋—兩橋亦爲之國建築之特產，原料爲竹橋麻繩，其堅强與耐久之程度，亦極可觀，應用於河面寛闊，山道崎嶇之處者最多，若四川雲南，極易見到。其建築之法，於河道或山谷之兩面，各柱高架，而綳以竹繩，繩上縳以大篮，約可容兩上地位，而另用細繩一根牵引之，卽可渡河過谷。又有更簡便者，於河岸柱一高架，上縳竹繩，而以此竹繩縳牢對岸較低處之石穴上，如是由上下滑，不用繩抽，亦可擺渡；而同時以同法反裝，則來去俱便。有時用兩平行之竹繩，同過一河，高低距五六呎爲宜，吾人可足踏下繩，而手攀上繩，是亦爲吊橋門之一。，吊橋之橋門，以一個者居多，橋門之兩端，各築站屋一所，中有兩柱，以拴兩繩，而各備絞盤一具，用以旋緊竹繩，不使寛宕爲要。至橋門之跨度則最大以二五○呎爲限。然廣西泯江之上，架有吊橋一座，計長七百英尺，闊九英呎用直徑六时半之竹繩十條建築結構，共分橋門六個，最大者跨約有二百英尺，其餘大小不一，引繩亦有五根之多，最吃重處之支架係用花崗石砌成，其餘均屬木材，橋面則爲普通之木板，行走其上，極能安全，而復有竹柱木釘，復吊橋橋身及橋面之結構，更形堅實。此外則金屬材料，可稱絕無用到，而毎年對於橋面之木板，必如鐡道之枕木然，須擇壞抽換，以免危險，卽竹繩亦須時常檢查，以保行旅之安全。是種竹製吊橋之耐拉力，約在每方時二六○○○磅之譜，故極能載重，其來源以始於西藏爲然，蓋至今此橋仍以西藏之建築爲最多故也。</p>

<h3 id="c284">平民化公共大厦的建築之芻議 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>公共大厦（或簡稱公寓）的建築，近年來在上海極形發逹，七層八層的高大建築，上聳雲霄，可以說得是荘嚴而富麗，經濟而切用，這在寸土千金的上海地方，確是値得我們來注意，並且加以研究的，但是目前此種公寓的建築，大都趨於奢華，太重装飾，其目的似乎全没有注意到一般城市中的居民的住宿問題，反似在競勝爭高，那就不免有違原則了，因此，這種建築的费用非常浩大，不求材料之革新與研究，專講觀瞻上的富麗堂皇，所以出入其中者，必是洋行的大班，公司的經理，每月的租金要上百的大洋，他們天天駕着自備的汽車，安閒自適，這種的福氣，祇有有錢的才能享到，甚而至於還是外人享受的居多，我們中國的人民却是極少數能够享受得到的，如此的現象，我們可以不可以說是社會經濟的發逹，人民生活的趨新呢？不，這不過是富人們享欒的一種設備而已，於普通的居民是絲毫没有什麽利益的，那麽爲什麽我們不能利用這種良好的建築方法，應用現代文明的進步，來使我們一般居民的住宿得到安全與舒適的新設備呢？要使建築的利益及到於一般的居民，那麽唯一的方法，我們就要使它平民化，這不是說簡陋或草率，不過是想法把建築的成本减輕，於是租金也就可以適合於普通居民的生活程度了。</p>
<p>（二）公寓的利益</p>
<p>公寓的建築，在外國是十分發逹，在我們中國，却是近年來才漸漸與起，其趨勢大有蓬勃的氮象，不過其弊處就在不能平民化，不能把它的利益完全的表顯出來，至於我們現在的住宅建築，專配一家人家居住，佔地方，多花錢，很不合算，而像里弄之間，一家要住數家人家，狹小得像鴿棚一般，簡陋與草率，更不必講，旣不講究衛生，也不求其清潔，火災的避免，全然没有想到，促進建築上的一般工業與商</p>
<p>（三）公寓的建造</p>
<p>平民化的公寓，在建造上並不可以草率，而設備方面也不可以因陋就簡，但是富麗堂皇却可以不必，装飾也不必講究，我以爲平民化的公寓，應具有下列的諸條件，就是·</p>
<p>（一）安全，如建築之堅固，火災之避免等；</p>
<p>（二）整潔，因爲整齊就是美觀，清潔可以防止病疫；</p>
<p>（三）舒適，居住必求舒適，但並非是奢華，因爲奢華是太不經濟，而且也不一定是使人舒服的；　　（四）壮觀，壮觀不在於装飾上講究，乃是整個建築的外觀，雄壮巍大。</p>
<p>這安全，整潔，舒適，壮觀，四條件，不僅是在建造公寓時應該注意，就是無論什麽建築都離不了這些條件，但是公寓的建造，却有一個很大的限制，就是建築費要愈節省愈好，那麽對於這種建築，我們决不可以沿用舊習，須要在材料上加以十二分的研究與考慮，木材的建築，不經久用，這是極大的缺點，並且易起火災，鋼鐡的建築，在目前價格也不便宜，若是將來我們能用鋼鐡的單位來建造房屋，那麽材料可以大量生産，價格當然要便宜得多，再有一種混凝土的建造方法，是比較上來適用些，也是應用各個混凝土的建築單位，建築起來旣堅固，又價廉，這個建築方法，是很値得我們研究的，至於建築的方法，本來是日新月異，固然不必泥守於一法，也不必去抄襲人家的發明，我們要力求改良，要超越人家，這才是建築家與工程家所應努力的，我們現在手頭有的是科學的學理，器械的發明，我們若要研究，若要試騐，若要創造，這又有什麽難處！</p>
<p>公寓内各種的設備，要力趨科學化，要顧到大衆的利害，如房屋加熱的装置，通氣的設備，空氣的調節，窗　的装設，以至於電氣自來水的供給等，都應該務求新式，减低成本，使居住者可以享受到極大的利益，而祗要負擔起有限的輕微費用，怎樣才能做得到這般的地步？惟有盡量的應用科學，而講到管理的問題，那也是很要緊的，不然，就是有很好的設備，也不能够保久；有了效率大的機器，也不能善用它，豈非可惜，不經濟是當然的結果，就是使居民要多加負擔這於公寓的，原則上就有不洽了。</p>
<p>公寓中對於疾病的防止，要特别的注意，因爲公寓内的居民很多，極容易傳染，所以清潔是十二分的重要，陽光之引入，空氣之流通，這在人多的地方是尤宜注意的，最好，公寓四週，應有隙地，種植樹木，使小孩們可以玩要，成人們可以息蔭，於衛生美觀上，都有裨益。</p>
<p>（四）公寓與都市的繁榮</p>
<p>上海可以算是繁榮了，人口三百餘襲</p>
<p>萬，商業的發逹，是全國第一，世界聞名，什麽都是國内各地所不及的，所以負治安責任的人，覺得其職守是很重大，他不僅要維持目下上海的繁榮，更須籌劃到未來的新的發展，孫中山先生是最先發覺到上海商塲之缺點，因此我們現在方有這大上海的計劃出現，但是一個城市愈發逹，人口必愈多，而住宿的問題就成了很重大的問題，所以我以爲公寓的建築是很値得研究的，假使我們說，上海的住宅全是公寓式的話，那麽在同一的地基上，一定可以增加人口至十倍二十倍以至於數十倍不等，就總計的話，上海的人口要增加到一千萬是一點没有困難的事，人口增加，商業必愈形發逹，都市的繁榮，蒸蒸日上，未來的光明，還有誰能把數目字來預卜呢凱斯洋行ＫｅｙｓＤｏｗｄｅｓｗｓｗｅｌｌ設計</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon announced in the House of Commons today that he had sent a note to Japan requesting an explanation of the declaration issued by Tokyo. Foreign Secretary Simon stated that the newspapers had extensively reported the unofficial statement regarding Japan's so-called policy of rejecting aid to China from various countries, and he felt that the time had come to receive a formal declaration.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon referred to the statement made by the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying, "The motive for this statement seems to be due to some actions of other countries in China that may affect peace, Sino-Japanese relations, or the integrity of China. There is no need to fear that any policy of the British government will cause such danger, as the British government's aim is to avoid such danger. However, the general nature and detailed content of this statement, such as financial aid to China, require us to send a note to Japan."</p>
<p>It is learned that the British government's note has been telegraphed to the British Ambassador in Tokyo to be presented to the Japanese government. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, Foreign Secretary Simon's note will urge Japan to reflect on the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, which prohibits any country from seeking special rights in China. This document may be released on Wednesday. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon answered questions in the House of Commons this afternoon regarding Japan's policy towards China. Liberal Party leader Samuel asked the Foreign Secretary to pay attention to the statement made by the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, and asked whether the Foreign Secretary could therefore contact the US government. Simon replied that he thought it would be more appropriate to issue a declaration after negotiating with Japan. He agreed with Samuel's statement that another declaration might be necessary in the future. Conservative Party member Casser suggested holding a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, but Simon did not directly answer this suggestion, only promising to notify the House of Commons after each event, and saying that he could continue to speak today. Chinese Minister Guo was in the House of Commons listening when Simon spoke, and later went to meet Simon to discuss everything. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Chinese ambassadors abroad today received instructions from Nanjing that the policies of the major governments towards Japan would change dramatically, possibly even leading to actual actions by various countries. Chinese diplomats stationed in London, Washington, Paris, Rome, and other countries have been ordered to immediately seek the opinions of the respective governments, and at the very least, to coordinate with them to warn Japan with the Nine-Power Treaty, insisting that no country should seek special rights in China. The House of Commons is prepared to raise questions on Monday,</p>
<p>to force the government to clearly announce its attitude towards the Far East issue. Various questions have been raised, among which Sir Kettlewell's question is the most important. Kettlewell's question reads, "Has the Foreign Office received any notification from Japan regarding its redefinition of its Far East policy to manipulate China's diplomacy?" Lieutenant General Knox's question is also quite important. Knox asked whether the government was aware of the rumors that the United States intended to recognize "Manchukuo." Labour Party member Weitewoo's question was, "Has the British government exchanged views with the United States to seek joint action regarding Japan's declaration?" It is believed that Foreign Secretary Simon will answer cautiously to avoid expressing a concrete anti-Japanese policy. Regarding Weitewoo's question, British newspapers have widely published it. As for the informal talks between American political leaders and journalists, who claimed that the United States was willing to cooperate with Britain to issue a joint declaration on the Far East situation created by the Tokyo declaration, British newspapers have also discussed it. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Chinese government's repeated declarations regarding the statement to Japan have been widely published in the local newspapers, and people's minds are gradually settling down. Chinese people in Washington held an anti-Japanese rally on the afternoon of the 22nd. It is reported that similar actions have taken place in other cities. (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) It is deeply believed in Geneva that Japan's declaration on its policy towards China this time has a possibility of driving the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations, enabling the League of Nations to obtain the support of the United States, and causing the attitude of the League of Nations General Assembly in May to become tougher. It is also sufficient to arouse the reaction of members of the Conservative Party and Progressive Party in Britain and France. The opinions of the Conservative Party members were originally indifferent to Japan's occupation of Manchuria, but now, seeing Japan intends to block Europe's access to trade in China, create a Sino-Japanese united force, and prepare to leap into a Far Eastern power after the First World War, they are extremely shocked. As for the European Progressive Party, which originally advocated restraining Japan's ambitions, there is now no doubt about it. This can be proved by Prime Minister Mussolini's article calling on Western countries to unite in resisting Japan's aggressive policy. At present, the Western powers still have conflicting opinions on the issue of military reduction and have no time to attend to this, but now they feel that the crisis is unavoidable, so they may not be able to succumb to Japan's demands and abandon their relations with China and the technical cooperation with China that has already been effective.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota made a statement today regarding the so-called unofficial statement on policy toward China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He first said that the previous statement was mainly to repeatedly clarify the following two points: (1) To clarify Japan's special position, responsibility, and interests in East Asia and urge the powers to reaffirm it; (2) To oppose the disregard of these facts, the alienation of China and Japan, and the destruction of the overall peace in East Asia. For example, aid to China by the powers is the result of obstructing Japan's political and economic interests or threatening Japan's national defense in the name of aid to China. Therefore, the Empire had no choice but to reject it based on the belief of maintaining peace in the Far East. However, the powers and China misunderstood the Empire's intentions, and even distorted it as a declaration to close the door to China, causing worldwide unrest and anti-Japanese remarks, which is incomprehensible. The Foreign Minister then pointed out that Japan's special interests in East Asia and the Open Door Policy towards China are both compatible and co-existent. This is sufficiently proven by the fact that Japan readily agreed to then-Secretary of State John Hay's proposal to open the door. I am convinced that the just arguments of the United States and other countries will be able to understand the fundamental intention of this statement. (23rd Denchu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota wants the naval disarmament conference to be held in Washington in 1935 to be a success. The issues discussed at the conference must be limited to the issue of naval disarmament, and the Far East issue should be excluded. Moreover, emotional conflicts regarding the Manchuria issue and the China issue must be resolved before the conference. Efforts are currently being considered toward the United States. However, the United States unexpectedly expressed a lack of understanding and narrow-mindedness regarding the unofficial statement on policy toward China made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 17th, which has caused difficulties for future efforts toward the United States. However, the previous statement was Japan's opening up of its ultimate and minimal hopes to the powers. Even if there are difficulties, it will inevitably promote understanding among Britain, the United States, and others. Therefore, it is determined to repeatedly declare and uphold its fundamental beliefs in the face of the instigation of some powers and opposition from emotions. (23rd Denchu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito met with a reporter from the Washington Star today and said that if a foreign country with business relations with China does not heed Japan's request to consult with Japan before proceeding, Japan will consider it an unfriendly act. Foreign countries have absolutely no idea how to deal with the Chinese. French bankers recently raised Chinese bonds in the European market, which has caused the Japanese government considerable anxiety. If foreign businesses disregard Japan's request, the responsibility should be borne by the Chinese government. When asked whether Japan would cooperate with other countries to jointly manage China, Saito replied that such cooperation might have been possible in the past, but it is no longer possible since the Manchurian Incident.

<p>(Moscow) The local newspapers published various commentaries from the world's press on the statement on policy toward China made by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. French newspapers stated that Japan's attempt was to oppose the United States and the Soviet Union, and at the same time, the statement indicated the victory of the aggressive military circles in Japan. The Contradiction Newspaper stated, "Japan is about to occupy the entire China, and the struggle in the Pacific has entered a new stage." Italian newspapers strongly emphasized the openly aggressive nature of Japan's plans for China. The Tribune newspaper stated that Japan's advance poses a serious threat to the interests of European powers in the Far East. A Washington reporter for the New York Herald Tribune stated that US officials were extremely dissatisfied with the Japanese statement, and were particularly unhappy with the statement that Japan was prepared to resort to force to preserve peace in East Asia. The New York Times stated that the US State Department clearly regarded Fang's statement as a trial balloon. The newspaper further stated, "Government officials expect Tokyo to make some kind of statement soon, and regard the current situation as extremely serious." (21st TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, the German Daily News published a strong editorial comment, saying that Japan had clearly rejected the powers and regarded itself as the master of Asia, and that the Twenty-One Demands would be fully realized.

<p>(Paris) French newspapers commented on the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration opposing aid to China from various countries, saying that Japanese foreign policy would increasingly implement a Monroe Doctrine for the Far East. This policy is actually aimed at the United States and has nothing to do with France. What can be said with certainty is that the United States will fully oppose Japan's aggressive policy. Two Monroe Doctrines are now in a confrontational situation, and the resulting arms race between the two countries is inevitable. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

<p>The United States Pacific Fleet, consisting of one hundred and one ships, will pass through the Panama Canal this morning and sail to the Atlantic Ocean. Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Schless originally planned to have only a few ships pass through the canal each day, with the entire fleet passing through within fourteen days. However, due to the need for rapid naval mobilization in wartime or in the event of war danger, the originally scheduled plan has been changed, ordering the entire fleet to pass through within twenty-four hours. All naval personnel who were granted leave to go ashore have now been recalled. The outside world suddenly heard this news and assumed that the fleet was about to be transferred back to its base in the Pacific Ocean, which caused quite a stir for a while.

<p>(Tokyo) The naval side is implementing the fiscal year 1934 budget, and because the air force is at a disadvantage compared to Britain and the United States, it is focusing on strengthening it. According to the Navy's Second Supplementary Plan, of the 39 air squadrons to be expanded, 21 squadrons had been completed by the end of fiscal year 1933. Even if the aircraft belonging to the fleet are added, the total number is only 646, and the number of maritime defense squadrons on the front line is only 80. Therefore, in order to supplement this disadvantage, the 44 million Japanese yen for the establishment of 18 additional squadrons will be used as a three-year continuous project. In fiscal year 1934, it seems that it has been decided to add 6 squadrons each to the Ōminato Air Squadron, the Tateyama Air Squadron, and the Saiki Air Squadron. (23rd Denchu Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person said that the main reason for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' unofficial statement was that the League of Nations would convene a technical conference on China in May this year. In this conference, investments in China and various development and construction projects would be discussed. Japan learned the details and issued this statement to curb the motives of the powers to invest in China, so that the future development of China would be monopolized by Japan's independent investment and aggression. However, Japan's statement not only failed to curb the actions of the powers towards China, but also aroused the unity of the world in taking steps against Japan. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

Zhao Lianfang, director of the Department of Agriculture, has been sent to inspect the situation first, leading a team to depart from Nanjing within three days. (2) The technical liaison between the League of Nations and us does not contain any political implications. According to the previous examples of the League of Nations cooperating with various countries, it is not our original creation. The Japanese side actually made this statement to oppose it, which is very boring and only exposes its aggressive ambitions. In short, Japan has no right to interfere in our cooperation with the League of Nations. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) Conservative Party member Charlton asked Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons today to pay attention to the fact that a French commercial firm had obtained an order worth £2.5 million for the supply of raw materials in "Manchukuo". Simon replied that, according to reports in the Japanese newspaper, the South Manchurian Railway had concluded a provisional contract with a French company for the supply of railway raw materials, but he knew that this contract did not involve such a huge amount as mentioned above. Conservative Party member Winterton said that Britain had not recognized "Manchukuo", so the powers of the British consul stationed in Manchuria might not be sufficient. Could assistance be given to them so that British merchants could obtain orders? Simon replied that he was certain that the efficiency of the consular service had not been diminished by the non-recognition of "Manchukuo". (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

The members exchanged detailed opinions. Since Li returned to the province, the Southwest's attitude towards the North China diplomatic issue has been slightly softened. It is heard that Wang [Jingwei] will send a telegram to the committees in Guangdong, asking the Southwest, regarding external communications, to maintain a spirit of solidarity in this time of national crisis, and to be cautious in issuing them, so as not to hinder international public opinion.

(23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the telegram from the Southwest was sent, two important members of the Central Government, in their private capacities, sent telegrams to Chen Jitang and Li Zongren to explain, mainly saying that rumors that the central authorities were in contact with the enemy and puppets to open traffic and postal services were actually created by the enemy to disperse the unity of our country and disrupt our country's diplomatic policy. If we suspect the central government because of this, it will not only not help matters, but will also fall into the enemy's trap. As for the other rumors, the Nanchang Conference was to compromise with the enemy and puppets, but the reality is that the Nanchang Conference was purely to discuss the major issues of suppressing bandits and internal affairs. Although there was discussion of foreign affairs, the central government has decided to implement the diplomatic policy step by step. In the future, we will only adhere to the original diplomatic stance. The rumors outside are purely fabricated by ambitious people. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e18">The Nation Should Pay Close Attention to Today's Situation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>——Governments of All Countries Should Understand Japan's Ambition——</p>
<p>Japan's recent diplomatic statement to China, though containing some probing elements, aiming to gauge the attitudes of various countries and our nation's reaction, nonetheless harbors extremely dangerous toxins. Its purpose is to place our country in the position of a vassal state, forging its so-called East Asian Monroe Doctrine, and suggesting the use of force to close China's doors. Such an unconventional diplomatic statement, if in Europe, no major power could apply it to any small nation, because it is an act of insulting the other party's national character, disregarding international trust, and interfering in the internal affairs of a friendly nation. But Japan, to this day, continues to speak of peace. In reality, since the night of "September 18th," Japan's actions have been even more ferocious, poisonous, and unreasonable than Germany's armed protection of peace before the war.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our own country, due to the overall decline of national economic strength and the incomplete unification of the domestic political situation, has very weak resistance. After several struggles, it has indeed ended in failure. But in today's position of our country, we should not shy away from admitting failure and should examine the reasons for our own failure and open up a proper path for the future. For example, if someone is sick, they should immediately seek medical treatment, recognize the symptoms, and then prescribe the right medicine to restore health. By analogy, our country should never despair, give up on itself, or feel regret. As the saying goes, "A brave man swallows blood along with his knocked-out teeth." This can serve as our motto for self-encouragement. We must never treat the loss of a tooth as an incurable disease and await death.</p>
<p>As for the handling of the Far Eastern situation by European and American countries, we have learned many lessons. We know that their interests are not entirely the same and will not abandon their inherent positions for no reason. However, after Japan's statement was issued, public opinion circles in Britain and the United States recognized that Japan's ambition to block the Chinese market has been exposed. Once it becomes a reality, their Far Eastern trade will be fundamentally shaken. Therefore, they must quickly devise countermeasures to maintain the open-door policy. From this point of view, Japan's statement does have the potential to promote Anglo-American unity and create a common Anglo-American front. However, although Anglo-American public opinion has shown resistance to Japan, their governments have not yet spoken out for justice, which we cannot help but regret.</p>
<p>In addition to Britain and the United States, the attitude of the Soviet Union is also worth paying close attention to. Currently, the Soviet Union and Japan are actively preparing for war. In order to win, Japan feels that coercing China is a necessary means for its strategy. Originally, Japan is now in an isolated position. If there are no countries to win over, once it goes to war with the Soviet Union, it will no longer be able to win the sympathy of most people in the world as it did during the first Russo-Japanese War. Just from the point of preventing communism, capitalist countries may lean towards Japan. However, the two major giants in capitalist countries (Britain and the United States) will certainly not forget reality for the sake of differences in national spirit. On the contrary, the current conflict of interest between Britain and Japan—especially the competition in the cotton textile market—is even worse than the Anglo-German relationship before the war. Speaking of the United States, Hirota's appeasement policy can only be used for a very short time. The confrontational situation between the two countries in the Pacific cannot be reconciled at all. The reason why Japan does not dare to rashly challenge Soviet Russia is partly because its internal arrangements are not yet in place and partly because it is subject to the passive restraint of Britain and the United States. However, since both sides have drawn their swords and are eager to try, the final disaster is likely to be unavoidable. Looking at the Soviet Union's all-night rush to build the Vladivostok fortress, the active development of airfields, and the deployment of Japanese troops in the Greater Khingan Range, Heihe, etc., and the spying on our country's Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang borders, all prove that the above is not a fallacy.</p>
<p>In the final and rapid brewing period of major explosive events, even if our country has suffered all kinds of tribulations and tasted all kinds of hardships, we still have to work hard with difficulty. We should recognize the current international situation, be full of self-confidence, and be prepared to cope with the "extraordinary times" in the coming emergency, so that we can overcome all difficulties and break a bloody path.</p>

Lakshman is now returning to Geneva to attend the League of Nations to report on his visit to China and to use his term of office. It has not yet been decided whether the League of Nations will send a successor to China in the future. As for cooperation matters, it will never be stopped by Japan's unreasonable opposition. This trip will first go to Xi'an and then to Lanzhou, Xining, and other places. The trip to Sichuan will have to wait until the Northwest is completed. The meeting place between myself and Dean Dai may be in Xi'an or Zhengzhou. The purpose of this inspection is to pay particular attention to rural areas and various products in the Northwest. Song continued, the capital of the Construction Bank Company has been determined to be 10 million yuan, which has been subscribed for by various banks. The company is purely private and has nothing to do with the government. The public business is limited. Whether a board of directors or a manager system will be established in the future and the date of establishment will be decided after I return to Kyoto. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

Lu immediately supervised the team to start training in Tangwang and Wangdu counties. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Shiming said, I visited He at 6 pm last night to report on the past and the reorganization situation in accordance with orders. He was very pleased and encouraged us to actively reorganize and train in the future so as not to fail the expectations of the people and the country. Our troops need seven trains to depart. If there are no major delays along the way, all of them can pass through Ping in three to five days. I will follow the last train to Xuchang to arrange everything. There are still four or five days left in Ping. Song Zheyuan is scheduled to come to Ping within a week to visit He and report on the inspection. Fu Zuoyi returned to Sui because he contracted cholera, so according to a private telegram from the Sui Provincial Government, his illness has gradually healed and he is still resting. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mao Jizhai, a senior staff officer of the branch, said that Yu Shiming's troops have been compiled according to the cavalry formation table promulgated by the Central Government in the 19th year and began to be transported from Baodong. The two infantry brigades of Lu and Liu have a large number of dismissed personnel, and many of them have entered Jin. About 10,000 people have been officially dismissed, and they have been transported by train from Bao in nine batches to Pinghan and Jinpu lines for dismissal. The reorganization of Lu and Liu's troops was initially based on the Northeast Army's formation in the 22nd year, and then they were ordered to use the Central Government's formation in the 19th year as the standard. Therefore, there was a problem with the number of personnel. I and Lu and Liu will visit He on the 25th to ask for instructions on how to deal with it. We will return to Bao in two or three days. Ding Ting's 1,000 troops have been transferred to Ningxia for reorganization. Ding has been appointed as the chief of staff of the 15th Route Army. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Yueting said that the formation of my 116th Brigade was ordered to be compiled into two regiments. The regimental commanders are Zhang Tiangong and Wang Suiqing. All of them have arrived in Baotou from Linhe and have been completed by Men Bingyue. The entire brigade's supplies and miscellaneous expenses are temporarily issued by the branch with 15,000 yuan to maintain the status quo. My task in Ping is to visit He to report on the reorganization situation. My brigade's defense area is ordered to be stationed in the Wangdu area. After visiting He, I will return to Bao to handle the departure. In the future, I will bring my troops to Hebei. Liu is still stationed in Baotou with surplus troops, and all of them will be dismissed within a few days. I will stay in Ping for three or four days and will not go to Bing for the time being. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lu Fengnian said that after my troops were reorganized into the 117th Brigade by the branch, and Wangdu, Tangxian, Xingtang, and Quyang counties in Ji Province were designated as defense areas, they began to move east from Wu Lin. The vanguard team arrived in Baotou on the 22nd and waited for the train to go south. The earliest two regiments of this brigade have 2,800 people each. The current quota for each regiment is 1,600 people. Because the number of personnel in this department is too large, I have come to Ping to visit He and ask for permission to add more personnel to maintain the old staff. At the same time, all the troops under my command are now wearing cotton clothes, and I plan to visit He Jiang to ask for a small subsidy for clothing expenses so that they can change their clothes. The security situation in Sui has now been restored. After Yang Hou's bandits fled, they are still active in Sui. The Jin-Sui army is closely encircling and suppressing them, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. Sun's army has not heard from us since they went to Jin. I don't know where they are now. I have no plans to go to Jin. After visiting He, I will return to the new defense area with Liu Yueting to handle the departure. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) With war rumors mounting in Europe, the French government has decided to actively expand its navy to reach the limits allowed by the 1925 Washington Treaty. The Doumergue Cabinet has decided to immediately participate in the naval arms race and is currently consulting with the parliament to allocate funds for the construction of four new warships. The Navy Department recently requested a total of 9,013,000,000 francs in funding. However, according to initial reports, the French naval budget for 1934 will be significantly reduced. The naval budget has been submitted to the Naval Committee of the parliament. If the parliament approves the government's proposal and prepares to take immediate action, the report on the budget will be completed soon. Even if it cannot be reviewed immediately, the Navy Department will proceed according to the original plan. Naval experts claim that the parliament will approve the naval budget during its meeting in May. Recent war rumors in Europe have made the future of the naval plan less likely to encounter obstacles. Since 1922, the French naval plan has been making steady progress, with an average of 35,000 tons of new ships being built each year. The government plans to build four new ships as follows: one second-class super cruiser, weighing 23,000 tons, which is already under construction; one destroyer; and two submarines. The shipbuilding plan began after the government decided to abolish the naval construction truce agreed upon with Italy. France also plans to allocate another 3,000,000,000 francs to make France's air force equal to any neighboring country. A "Five-Year Air Force Plan" has been drafted to build light and fast fighters, pursuit planes, reconnaissance planes, and bombers. According to foreign naval experts, the French super cruiser under construction is the largest in the world, and its power is enough to defeat the combined attack of any two cruisers. The super cruiser can travel at 40 knots per hour, making it faster than any ship. The range of its guns can reach 30 miles. According to naval personnel, this type of super cruiser can fire 20 thirteen-inch shells per minute, so it can destroy enemy ships outside the enemy's firing range. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

The friendship between France and Poland is based on reason and emotion, so it is unbreakable. He recalled participating in the signing of the Franco-Polish alliance in 1921. He came here this time to renew the old friendship, because the situation and time have proved that all the sincere and coordinated efforts in the past were not in vain. He continued that Franco-Polish friendship is a factor of peace, stability, order, and security. Although the League of Nations should be responsible for ensuring universal security, the spirit of good faith is a necessary prerequisite for reducing armaments. Barthou also said that France and Poland may have some conflicts in economic positions, but they should also strive to approach each other with the same efforts. In conclusion, he said that France and Poland can unite in action and ideals. All nations that are noble, harmonious, love their country, and do not forget the spiritual connection of Europe should take this as their golden rule. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

"This is not only to prevent Romania's bankruptcy, but most importantly to prevent drastic changes in its foreign policy.

At the same time, there have been many riots in various cities in Spain. Spanish Prime Minister Lerroux insisted on the policy of suppressing the chaos. According to the report at 6:00 PM today, the police occupied the roofs and fought against the rebels, firing 200 shots. Two churches were burned, and the fire illuminated the sky.

<p>(Paris) The National Communist Party and the Socialist Party are staging demonstrations against the government's pay cuts. Today, Finance Minister Mandante issued a statement stating the reasons for the government's austerity policy, saying that the government, in the face of financial difficulties, wants to avoid defaulting on its debts, and there are only three possible coping methods: (1) borrowing money, (2) lowering the value of the currency, and (3) saving money to balance revenue and expenditure. Lowering the value of the currency is not feasible, and borrowing money cannot be done, because France needs to borrow at a 6% interest rate, while Britain only needs 2.5%. The current high cost of living must be fundamentally eliminated and adjusted by prudent and gradual methods. The root causes are (1) interest rates are too high, (2) taxes are too heavy, and (3) railway fares are extremely high. The Finance Minister also said that the government's policy will now allow the large sums of money engaged in hoarding due to the instability of the situation to circulate in the market, thereby increasing purchasing power. Before the Finance Minister issued this article, French Prime Minister Doumergue gave a sincere radio address, asking the people of the country to unite and stop the disputes.

<p>(New York) According to statistics on the world's exports of arms and military supplies in the past ten years, the total value is US$5 billion, with the largest amount of arms shipments in 1932. In addition to finished military supplies, there are also many raw materials, such as nitrates, which have equal value in peacetime and wartime. In recent months, Chile's nitrate exports have soared, mostly transported through the Panama Canal to the East. From January to November 1922, aircraft exports from the United States were 67% higher than the total amount in the previous year. The Curtis-Wright factory shipped aircraft to Soviet Russia, Japan, China, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and South American countries last year. The US Navy purchased 1,100 aircraft, and the Army Department ordered more than 1,800 aircraft. The explosives sold by DuPont Company in 1933 increased by 24% compared to 1932. The revenue in 1932 was US$23,363,000, and it increased to US$37,262,000 last year. According to DuPont Company, it supplied 80% of the arms to the Allied powers during the Great War. The United Kingdom and the United States have now decided to build warships in accordance with the limits of the naval treaty. A member of the Japanese parliament requested two months ago to levy a special tax on military factories, which is said to be "the most prosperous industry in today's Japanese industry." According to the Chronicle of Japan on January 6, the military supplies imported in 1931 amounted to 778,867 Japanese yen, and increased to 6,452,077 yen in 1933. The import volume of special steel was 884,981 yen in 1931, and it jumped to 4,465,018 yen in 1933. According to the report of the International Nickel Company of Canada, the profit in 1933 was 9,662,583 yuan, which is incomparable to the loss of 135,344 yuan in 1932. Nickel is the main raw material of arms. The Cinatre-Krisso Company of France manages 412 arms manufacturing plants in France, the Little Entente, and the Balkans.

<p>Military Policy Achieves Another Victory</p>
<p>China Policy to Become More Aggressive</p>
<p>The resignation of Army Minister Hayashi Senjūrō is ostensibly due to his younger brother, Shirokami Yūkichi, being convicted of bribery, for which he feels deeply responsible. However, the reality is not so simple. Of course, Hayashi Senjūrō, to maintain his image as a military statesman, could not but express his resignation. However, there is an unprecedented miracle regarding the Cabinet of Japan this time: when he tendered his resignation, he did not recommend a successor as Army Minister.</p>
<p>According to the long-standing customs of the Japanese Cabinet organization, the Army Minister has special powers. He is considered a member of the political party cabinet, but does not advance or retreat with the political party cabinet. His source is not a recommendation from the political party when forming the cabinet, but rather a result of consultations among the three leaders of the army (i.e., Chief of Staff, Inspector General of Military Education, and Minister of the Army), who then recommend him to the cabinet head. The Prime Minister has absolutely no power to refuse or negotiate a replacement. The Saitō Makoto Cabinet was a mixed-party cabinet, and Saitō himself was a senior figure in the navy, so problems in the navy seemed unlikely. However, the army caused him headaches. The reason for the Army Minister's resignation this time is very legitimate, and his attitude is very firm. If he were to truly resign, the cabinet would be in an extremely difficult position, because the successor Army Minister should be nominated when the current Army Minister resigns, but this has not been done. Leaving it like this would make the current cabinet very embarrassed.</p>
<p>There are various complex relationships behind the scenes of this Army Minister's resignation. First, since the beginning of this year, the struggle between the militarists and the capitalists has been extremely fierce, extending from the South Manchurian Railway reorganization issue to domestic and foreign affairs, especially diplomatic relations with the United States, Britain, and China, and also with the Soviet Union. However, Japan's preparations for war with the Soviet Union have long been commonly acknowledged by the capitalists. It is only the other diplomatic relations, especially with China, that are at issue. The capitalists advocate a moderate diplomacy, advocating economic goodwill. The militarists believe that military needs should be the basis, and diplomacy should follow military shifts, even with Britain and the United States. Second, the middle-ranking officers in the military strongly advocate the continued implementation of a tough policy, and absolutely cannot allow other countries to interfere in China, nor can they allow China to lean towards pro-British and pro-American stances. Third, they see that China is consistently approaching the League of Nations, such as technical cooperation, as well as silver companies, and the development of aviation, all of which have international entanglements. Aviation in particular is a step that Japan fears, so the military demands that the government have a concrete and definitive expression, an expression of a tough policy. Otherwise, the military will take actions uncooperative with the cabinet. Not recommending a successor Army Minister is one aspect of this. Therefore, since Army Minister Hayashi's resignation on the 11th of this month, the cabinet has been very panicked, the financial capitalists have been very uneasy, and the various political parties feel that a great disaster is looming. If there is no way to mediate, whether Araki Sadao is reappointed as Army Minister, or even a military cabinet is realized, then the so-called constitutional politics will come to an end from now on, and the capitalists will have to go to the military to make a living. Fortunately, the Saitō Cabinet painstakingly mended the situation. After being comforted by the Chief of Staff, Hayashi Senjūrō decided to revoke his resignation and resume his post. On the 18th of this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an unofficial statement, expressing his intention to monopolize the Chinese market and the meaning of the East Asian Monroe Doctrine. The main reason why the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued this statement was to quell internal discontent, and at the same time to take the opportunity to probe the attitudes of the United States and Britain. The military's opinion still supports its traditional thinking, believing that the United States is struggling in an economic panic, Britain is just beginning to recover, and has no spare capacity, the Soviet Union will definitely not help China, and Europe itself is in a time of multiple events, and has no time to look east. Taking this opportunity to put pressure on China, seize the entire market, or at least control North China, is a very advantageous approach. However, the government has two preparations: one is to comply with the military's demands, while at the same time strengthening the capitalists' front, and the other is to examine the international atmosphere, and continue to strive for the US-Japan alliance movement, to make the United States understand Japan's position, and prepare for the demand for naval equality, as a step for future exchange. After all, this statement is just a prelude, and the real drama is yet to come. (April 19th, Tokyo)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After the Red bandits from eastern Jiangxi infiltrated northern Fujian, they captured Jiangle from Jianning, advanced towards Yong'an from Qingliu, and used small detachments to harass Shaxian's Xiamao and Nanping's Wangtai. The 10th Column Commander of the Eastern Route Army, Tang Enbo, stationed troops from [illegible] and other divisions in Tai Ning, Mingxi, Shaxian, Yong'an, and Shunchang counties. Fierce battles have been taking place with the bandits in recent days. It is learned that the bandits in the Jiangle and Wangtai areas belong to Peng Dehuai's forces, and the bandits in the Yong'an and Xiamao areas belong to Luo Binghui's forces. The Eastern Route Army is using [illegible] two divisions to attack Jiangle from Tai Ning and Shunchang. The offensive began on the 11th, advancing from the border of Tai Ning's Shuinan and the border of Shunchang's Wan'an to Xikou and Liangfang across the stream from the county seat. The bandits have set up defensive works in the suburbs to resist. [illegible] two divisions have surrounded them. In Yong'an, [illegible] two divisions have also surrounded them. Yong'an ordered the [illegible] division to firmly defend the city and wait for reinforcements. According to a telegram from [illegible] Division Commander yesterday, the bandit forces in the Hufang and Xinkou areas have been defeated. [illegible] division also sent troops to attack from both sides. The bandit forces were unable to resist and showed signs of fleeing towards Ningyang and Liancheng in western Fujian. The Fuzhou Headquarters immediately telegraphed Eastern Route Army Commander-in-Chief Jiang Dingwen, ordering 4th Column Commander Li Yannian to quickly advance towards Ningyang and Liancheng to intercept. As for the scattered bandits harassing Wangtai and Xiamao, 9th Column Commander Liu Heding has dispatched troops from Nanping and Shaxian to suppress them, and they should be cleared within days. Furthermore, Eastern Route Frontline Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang returned to Fujian on the Jiesheng steamship from Shanghai on the 19th. He will lead the Frontline Headquarters personnel to Yanping within days to preside over military affairs in northern Fujian. (April 20th)</p>

<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Liu Guitang's bandit forces captured Ganyu County seat on the 3rd of this month. After Wang Jun sent troops to block and suppress them, and the Shandong army pursued them, they immediately fled back into Shandong territory. Wang Jun's troops then returned to defense from the east with a portion, and a portion remained stationed in the Xinan Town area. Unexpectedly, after Liu's bandits were suppressed in eastern Shandong and had nowhere to escape, they infiltrated Ganyu territory again on the 20th of this month from the Antong Street and Mazhan areas of Rizhao, and fled towards the southwest of Ganyu territory. After Wang Jun received Han Fuju's telegram on the 19th reporting the bandit tracks, he immediately ordered</p>

<p>Shantou Dispatch: In addition to the provincial national tax, the Chao-Mei counties also have local taxes levied by police districts or security groups, which are extremely harsh and detailed. For example, in Zhanglin Town, Chenghai County, the district office recently announced that the various donations from last year have expired, and specially solicited merchants on the 10th to openly bid for the continuation of business. The monthly amount of donations from each merchant is recorded below: Chicken, Goose, and Duck Donation: 27 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 he, won by Gongsi; Newlywed Donation: 24 yuan and 8 jiao, won by Heyu Shun Company; Firewood Donation: 42 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen, won by Yihe Company; Banquet Donation: 41 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen, won by Pingan Branch; Peanut Donation: 2 yuan per month, won by Yushun Company; Stream Front Porter Donation: 7 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen per month, won by Yuemei Company; Charcoal Donation: 11 yuan and 5 jiao per month, won by Yuemei Company; Pig Broker Commission Donation: 28 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen, won by Yushun. The names of the above taxes are not unusual, and there are even more unusual ones in other counties. However, by extrapolation, the people's livelihood is withered, which can be seen generally. (17th)</p>
<p>The Lianghuai Smuggling Suppression Team rushed from Haizhou to defend Ganyu Qingkou, and at the same time ordered the 7th Division troops stationed in Xinan Town to take cars to Baitabu and disembark, advancing to Shanzhen to suppress them. According to Han's telegram, he has ordered Zhan's division to follow closely from Antong Street, and Tang's brigade to advance east from Linyi, expecting to meet with the 7th Division. Because Zhan's division was pursuing them, the bandits fled to the Daxu Mountain area in the northern border of Haizhou on the 21st. The 7th Division troops came attacking from the side of Shanzhen, so the bandits turned to the northwest and fled to Xihuang and Xiaowangzhuang in the southwest of Juxian and the southeast of Linyi on the afternoon of the 21st, thus leaving Jiangsu territory again and fleeing back to Shandong territory. When Liu's bandits re-entered Jiangsu, the Central Air Force bombing planes No. 67 and 74 came to Xuzhou from Nanchang to inspect the situation and assist in suppressing the bandits. They have been flying to Xihuang and Xiaowangzhuang between Juxian County and Linyi in recent days, threatening the bandits. Zhan's division, which was pursuing from the east, has caught up with the bandit forces, and Tang's brigade, which was pursuing from the west, is only separated from the bandits by a mountain. The 7th Division troops have also advanced north from Shanzhen, so there is completely no trace of bandits in Jiangsu territory. (April 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e94">New Suiyuan Automobile Route Scenery <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>In the newly developed transportation of Xinjiang and the inland regions, the New Suiyuan long-distance bus service, renowned for its remarkable achievements and high reputation, has its main station in Suiyuan.  We visited Director Mou Pengling of the station, who warmly welcomed us and engaged in extensive discussions. Director Mou, originally involved in education in the Northeast, joined the company and traveled to Xinjiang, providing valuable insights into the conditions along the route. He mentioned that Xinjiang's land is vast and the situation precarious, making it difficult to gain a deep understanding without personally visiting. While the New Suiyuan automobile route holds significant commercial and economic value, its strategic importance for national defense is far less than the Gansu-Xinjiang line. This is because the New Suiyuan line is close to Outer Mongolia and easily susceptible to external threats, whereas the Gansu-Xinjiang line is like a vital artery that urgently needs to be cleared. The New Suiyuan line spans 5,980 Chinese miles from Suiyuan to Dihua. The terrain along the route is mostly flat and passable, except for Wugongba, which has a steep gradient. In areas like Bailing Temple, Haiya Amatu, Saihutun, and Heishatu, there are many soft sandy rivers. In Mailinggen and other places, there are numerous Cogon grass mounds. In places like Chahandian ceremony and Keketaolaigai, there are many mountain valleys and gullies. West of Keketaolaigai, water is scarce and tastes bitter, making travel difficult, but these obstacles can be overcome with manpower. Westward from Suiyuan, the residents of Wuchuan are engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry, with the Han people primarily engaged in agriculture and the Mongolian people primarily engaged in animal husbandry. Further northwest to Bailing Temple, there are over ten Mongolian and Han shops, serving as the gateway for entering and exiting Inner Mongolia from the Northwest. Beyond this point, villages become scarce, and human habitation is rare. One might encounter nomadic Mongolians with only two or three families every seven or eight hundred miles. The journey is characterized by desolate wilderness, continuous mountains, and vast ravines, with winding and rugged sandy terrain. One can imagine the difficulties in driving and equipment. Upon reaching Hami, villages and towns become commonplace.  Places such as Gu Chengzi and Dihua are bustling commercial hubs with larger populations compared to other areas. The rugged mountain paths and the impassable stretches of sand dunes and quicksand rivers along the route should be prioritized for repair and construction, followed by other sections, to ensure the completion of a solid highway. Mr. Bai Xuchu, a director of the company from Xinjiang, was also present. He said that the Northwest provinces are arid and receive little rainfall, but the snow on the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang melts and irrigates the fields like gushing springs, resulting in lush water and grass, suitable for both farming and grazing. The main mineral resources, particularly in northern Xinjiang, are abundant with gold, silver, iron, tungsten, coal, oil, crystal, salt, and other materials. Furthermore, the jade of Hetian in southern Xinjiang is renowned both domestically and internationally. If the Chinese people do not unite to develop this great land and its limitless resources, it is highly likely that we will repeat the mistakes made in the Northeast. Later, the company insisted on hosting a banquet and invited over ten members of the press, including Lin Chaoran, Yang Lingde, and Wang Xizhou, to accompany them. During the banquet, they expressed their sincerity and welcomed guidance.</p>
<p>The newspaper industry in Suiyuan is quite developed, with two major newspapers, the Suiyuan Daily (government-run) and the Suiyuan Republic Daily (party-run). There are also smaller newspapers like the Social Daily (Department of Education), the Morning Post (related to the Party Headquarters), and the recently published Industrial Daily. News agencies include the Suiyuan News Agency, the Suiyuan News Service, the Saibei News Agency, the Northwest News Agency, and the Guihua News Agency. All of these are located in the provincial capital. In other counties, only Baotou has the Baotou Daily and the Bianwen News Agency. Some individuals are eager to establish another newspaper that truly represents the people's voice, but due to financial difficulties, they are unable to realize it at this time.</p>
<p>Since Suiyuan was opened as a commercial port in the third year of the Republic and the entire PingSui Railway was opened to traffic, commercial prosperity has increased day by day, needless to say. However, since the Outer Mongolian incident, traffic has been cut off, tea and cloth cannot be sold, and fur and hides are blocked from sources. The blow to commerce is almost the same as that of Zhangjiakou. Fortunately, prices are low and it is still easy for ordinary people to make a living. Mr. Yang Lingde (chief editor of the Suiyuan News Agency) served local flavor drinks one after another, which were rich and delicious, and the price was cheap and good, which is truly worthy. Moreover, there are no bad habits of using female receptionists like in Pingjin Zhangjiakou. I once took a rickshaw, the cushions and backrests were made of flannel, and the footrests were covered with plush carpets, which was more luxurious than private cars in Shanghai. The daily rental price is only two or three jiao, and the rickshaw driver earns two or three jiao a day, which is enough for a family of five. For example, students in Pingjin need six or seven yuan a month for food, but three yuan is enough here.</p>
<p>The tomb of Han Mingfei Zhao Jun is located twenty miles south of the city, on the bank of the Dahei River. The surrounding fields are fertile. Five or six miles out of the city, the road passes through sandy land, the car travels silently, the spokes rise and the sand spills out, like a mill spitting out powder. Looking ahead, the "Green Tomb" rises prominently in the distance, its color is verdant, but it is still more than ten miles away. The tomb is eight or nine zhang high and is circular facing south. There are six public stone tablets erected on the flat ground, all built since the end of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China. There is a winding path to the west that can be climbed. There is an earthen cave on it, with a bell and earthen figurines, called the Daxian Temple (ie Fox Immortal), which the village children worship. Broken tiles and bricks can be seen at the tomb site, and it is estimated that there must have been temples and words in previous generations. On the return trip, we visited the first spring on the Nine Borders (ancient Wuliang Temple) and several other Lama temples. The situation is similar to Huaping Yonghe Palace and Nanjing Confucius Temple. Lama temples are commonly called "Zhao". Shops are set up in the buildings, but business is not prosperous. There is also a Bing in front of "Dazhao," with eight mouths a day, called Yuquan Water (ie Kangxi's inscription "First Spring on the Nine Borders"), which residents take and draw from. The street east of the spring is called South Street, which is very lively. Yang Lingde took full responsibility as a guide, and his deep friendship and enthusiasm were touching.</p>
<p>The New Suiyuan Automobile Company is preparing for its third westward journey, but the date has not yet been determined. Therefore, the reporter will still follow the original plan and go to Ninggan first. Mr. Huipin heard about it and made a special trip to visit him. The most worrying thing is that bandits often appear along the way. If you encounter them, the best way to deal with it is to be alert. The first important thing is to make them not suspect that I am resisting, remember, remember. Secondly, the climate in the places you pass is cold and dry, and you must be prepared with clothing and medicines, etc. The borderland inspection passport issued internally has been transferred by Director Yan of the Department of Education, and should be stamped by the provincial government. I will go to Baotou tomorrow (17th).</p>
<h3 id="e95">Min River: Sailing Ships and Steamships Compete for Transportation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>#### Steamship Association Petitions Party and Government Authorities</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Min River, the largest waterway in Fujian, originates from the Luxi and Guangze counties on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. It flows through Shaowu, Shunchang, and Nanping, dividing into three branches: east, north, and west. The north branch flows from Nanping through Jian'ou and Pucheng, entering Zhejiang Province. The west branch flows from Nanping to Shaxian. The east branch flows from Nanping through Gutian, Minqing, and Minhou, entering the sea. Before the opening of maritime trade, it was a vital route between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Previously, sailing ships navigated the river. It is estimated that there were no fewer than a thousand sailing ships of various sizes, supporting the livelihoods of tens of thousands of boatmen. In recent years, merchants and travelers, in order to develop transportation, have pooled funds to purchase steamships, which have become increasingly popular. Over a decade, the number of steamships has grown from a few to over a hundred. Passengers and cargo shippers have abandoned sailing ships in favor of steamships, severely impacting the livelihoods of boatmen. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, they organized the Civil Boatmen's Union, seeking to engage in a showdown with the steamships. The situation on the Min River was extremely dangerous. Steamships were at risk of being destroyed by the Civil Boatmen's Union. Steamship merchants also organized the Steamship Association, requesting military protection. This stalemate lasted for two years, resulting in significant losses for both sides and severely hindering commercial transportation. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, party and government authorities intervened as arbitrators, agreeing to revise the agreement. The three types of goods transported from the upper reaches of the Min River (i.e., northern Fujian) to the lower reaches (i.e., Fuzhou)—tea, paper, and bamboo shoots—and the three types of goods transported from the lower reaches of the Min River to the upper reaches—powdered salt, rice, and vermicelli—were all to be transported by sailing ships. The navigation routes of steamships were also restricted. The North Stream was only allowed to navigate to Jian'ou, the West Stream to Shaxian, and the Central Stream to Yangkou. Beyond these points, the river becomes shallow and rapid, making navigation impossible. This arrangement allowed for a period of relative peace. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the arbitration period expired, and disputes arose again between the two sides. Party and government authorities extended the agreement for another two years. At the end of March this year, the agreement expired for the second time. Steamships, no longer restricted, began to transport all types of goods. On April 1st, the Civil Boatmen's Union gathered a large number of boatmen at the Hongshan Bridge on the Min River outside the West Gate of Fuzhou. Whenever a steamship carrying tea, paper, bamboo shoots, rice, vermicelli, salt, or other goods passed by, they would seize the ship and unload the cargo. Within ten days, over twenty steamships were seized, and cargo worth five to six hundred thousand yuan was unloaded. Steamship merchants, unable to conduct business freely, initiated a general strike on April 11th, which continues to this day. Transportation on the Min River has been almost completely disrupted. This has had a particularly severe impact on the seasonal transport of goods to the province and the city. The Steamship Association has dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition for the right to transport goods freely. Various merchant guilds have also submitted petitions to party and government authorities, stating that the freight rates for sailing ships are expensive, the journey is slow, and the risks along the way are high, making them inferior to the convenience of steamships. They request permission for merchants to freely hire ships to transport goods, aligning with the principles of progress. However, the issue of how to provide relief to the livelihoods of thousands of boatmen urgently needs to be resolved. (April 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Famine in Qiongya, Guangdong Province: Famine Victims Gather in Groups to Plunder Food; Local Organizations Call for Relief <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Qiongya, Guangdong Province, is originally an area rich in natural resources and products. However, due to the government's failure to develop it and the years of Communist banditry, the political situation and local economy are impoverished. Fortunately, there are many overseas Chinese who remit a considerable amount of money each year, which helps to support the region's economy. However, in recent years, the economy of Southeast Asia has declined, and unemployed overseas Chinese have returned to their hometowns in droves, severely impacting the social economy. Last year, the region was hit by a typhoon, destroying all crops. This year, it has been struck by a rare drought, resulting in missed spring plowing. As a result, farmers in various counties have been selling their wives and children. Some have even gathered in groups to loot food. In the fourth district of Qiongshan County, a village of farmers, carrying their wives and children, have gone out to beg for food, totaling 300 people. These famine victims enter farms and dig up taro, potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs, which is a tragic situation. The Haikou Chamber of Commerce, witnessing this situation, sent a telegram yesterday to appeal to the authorities for relief. The original telegram stated: "Guangzhou sends to the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group,"</p>
<p>"Chen, Provincial Chairman Lin Diaojian, the famine in Qiongya is worsening day by day, and deaths are occurring in succession. Some gather in groups to loot food, affecting public security. Beg to allocate funds urgently to the Pacification Committee for distribution to various counties for relief. Extremely urgent, awaiting orders. Haikou Chamber of Commerce Chairman Tang Pin San, bows." Another telegram from Li Zuoxin, County Magistrate of Chengmai County, Qiong Prefecture, and Wang Dinghua, Commander of the Defense Corps, to the Provincial Government and Headquarters stated, "Chengmai suffered a severe wind disaster last year, resulting in a very poor harvest. This year's rare drought has resulted in the failure of miscellaneous grains. Starving people have no one to turn to and frequently rush to fields to forcibly take food, and the owners are unable to stop them. Many have even forcibly entered homes to beg for food and refuse to leave, especially in the first, second, and fifth districts. Zuoxin has already used the warehouse donation to supervise the chamber of commerce in raising more than a thousand yuan to first handle Ping County and has separately submitted applications for the allocation of funds. In desperation, I beg your Excellency to grant approval to temporarily allocate 20,000 silver dollars from the provincial treasury or other relief funds to the county, to be kept by the committee composed of legal institutions, and to purchase rice grains and miscellaneous grains on a daily basis for subsidized sale and relief. If approved, please telegraph the Haikou branch of the treasury to allocate the funds nearby to avoid delay. This loan will still be made up by the local management committee and returned in full in August." However, it is not yet known whether Chen Jitang and others will generously provide relief.

<p>Ganzhou Correspondence: Jiangxi Province is full of mountains and deep valleys, so bandits can hide in them. It is because the roads are blocked and transportation is inconvenient that it is difficult to supply the army in the crusade, so it has not been possible to clear up the effect as soon as possible. Since the completion of highways in various places one after another, transportation is convenient, transportation is fast, and one place is built in one place, and then the key points are selected to build carvings for defense. Now the bandits have no foothold. Last month, after Chen Cheng's troops in the North Road Army won a great victory in the Battle of Baishe, they prepared to continue to advance and directly attack the bandits' den, so the divisions of the 18th Army quickly took on the task of constructing the entire section of the road from Nanfeng Station through Beimen to Baishe, which is 60 Chinese miles long. In addition, Army Commander Luo Zhuoying personally supervised the officers and soldiers to build the road in the rain, which was very hard. In less than a week, the entire project was completed and can be opened to traffic. It is said that the army will continue to advance in the short term, and Guangchang, which the bandits regard as a lifeline, can be recovered soon.</p>

<p>Xiaokunshan, in the ninth district of the county, is close to the Mao River and borders Qingpu. Bandits often appear. The other day, Wang Huankun, the district chief of the ninth district, reported that several bandit ships were found in Qing territory, carrying 40 or 50 bandits, all armed. Afraid that they would flee into the country, people were panicked. He specially called the county government to ask for the dispatch of police teams to the countryside to block them. The county government immediately sent a platoon of police and two patrol boats of the water patrol team to leave in different directions, arriving at the border that night and stationed there. Later, it was found that Maojiabang, a small town, was invaded by a large group of bandits, who threatened to loot. Later, the town merchants raised funds to pay for their lives, avoiding looting. It is said that the amount reached 1,500 yuan. Since the cash could not be collected immediately, term promissory notes were issued for payment, and the bandits set sail and left. Fortunately, they did not enter Song territory, so Xiaokunshan and its surroundings were as peaceful as ever.</p>

Yesterday (22nd) morning, the Songjiang New Life Movement Conference of all walks of life was held in the public stadium. Although it was cloudy and rainy, more than a thousand representatives of various organs and people attended the meeting. Li Chang, chairman of the Party Committee, presided over the ceremony, reported on the essence of the New Life Movement, and then Jin County Magistrate and others gave speeches and dispersed.

<p>Recently, the practice of township residents racing lamps in various townships has caused trouble. After the demolition of the police station in Tinglin, County Magistrate Yan ordered the district chiefs to stop it, but the trend spread and has not been stopped. The other day, a large number of township residents in Sijing also raced lamps into the town. It was found that it was initiated by Yang, and the police were ordered to arrest him. Unexpectedly, this caused the township residents to make trouble. The other night, a number of hooligans rushed into the substation, intending to destroy it, but because of the proper prevention, only the glass windows were slightly damaged, and the storm subsided.</p>

<p>In order to rectify road traffic and ensure the safety of travelers, the Highway Administration Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction plans to hold a general examination of automobile drivers in the province. All automobile companies, shops, homes, organs, and schools within the province that have automobiles, their automobile drivers, whether employed or owners with driving skills, should follow the regulations of the province's Provisional Regulations for Managing Automobile Drivers and the office's regulations for examining drivers, and from now on, go to the examination locations to await examination, in order to be issued a license. Anyone who has not been examined and issued a license shall not drive an automobile within the province. After passing the examination, the office will first issue a temporary license. After one month, if there are no errors or violations, a unified license for the five provinces and cities will be issued. The seven counties of Jiangyin, Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, Wuxian, Changshu, and Wujiang are scheduled to be examined in Wuxi from April 28 to May 7, and the results will be announced on May 8.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has recently established a farm produce sales and transportation office, and its business is developing rapidly and its results are excellent. It is indeed an important task to help the rural economy. Now the bank has found that Changshu, Nantong, and Jiangyin counties have always been cotton-producing areas with abundant cotton production. It has sent personnel to Changshu to conduct detailed investigations. It is now proposed to organize a large-scale cotton production, sales, and transportation office in Changyinsha, where the three counties meet. The method will be handled in accordance with the Farm Transport Office, and the province will instruct the county to inform.</p>

<p>Bu Da, a porter from Jiangbei who picks up and delivers luggage at Lunbu in Beimen of this city, has a niece, Xiao Yinzi, who married Chen Shaolan as his wife last year. The couple had a very good relationship, but Bu Da's second wife, Wu, was not on good terms with Xiao Yinzi, so she was often abused by Wu. Chen went to Sujialu to work as a road worker. The other day, Xiao Yinzi suddenly died. After Chen received the news, he went to Bu's house to visit, but was refused. Chen believed that Xiao Yin's death was unclear, so he specially requested the county government to examine it. Yesterday, the examiner Xu led the examiners and police to the mortuary. After first summoning the corpse husband Chen Shaolan and the Weijia Miao Kangshou, he ordered the coffin of Xiao Yinzi, which had been buried, to be taken out, opened, and examined. First, the clothes were cut off, washed with wine and water, and examined in detail. The examiner found that the lower part of the body was red and swollen, and the inside was broken, and blood was flowing from the seven orifices. It was caused by the shaking of the fetus, and there was no phenomenon on the upper part that could be detected, not a boil. It was obviously caused by death. After the examination, the corpse husband was ordered to put the coffin back. The next time, he will be summoned.</p>

<p>Shen Qinsong, a resident of the Wan Village in Beishitou Village, Fengjing, was over fifty years old. His son, A Si, was in his twenties. For self-defense, he had purchased a pistol, usually kept by A Si. Yesterday, during his leisure time, A Si took out the pistol to play with. Seeing a flock of crows outside the door, he was secretly pleased. He loaded a bullet and walked towards the crows, aiming to shoot. However, A Si's loading skills were poor, causing a loud bang and the bullet to fire sideways, hitting his own head. He instantly suffered a shattered and bloody head, with brain matter exposed, and died on the spot. Later, when the family noticed A Si's prolonged absence, they searched everywhere and found him lying in the field, lifeless for some time. They immediately gathered the family, carried the body home, prepared a coffin, and completed the funerary arrangements.</p>

They arrived yesterday morning at six o'clock. They then boarded a small steamer and landed at the New Customs Wharf. Previously, the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission had received a telegram and specially sent representatives to Shanghai to welcome them.

<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, met with visiting reporters at his residence yesterday afternoon. He stated that the unofficial statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry viewed China as a protectorate, revealing their ambition. The powers in China each have their rights and interests, and they would not remain silent. Therefore, the public opinion of various countries is in uproar. Our Foreign Ministry has already issued an unofficial statement, informing the world. Regarding the issue of postal and customs in North China, President Wang has already issued a statement that it will not proceed due to a lack of fundamental solutions. As for transportation matters, nothing has been decided, and there is no basis for negotiation. If a decision is made in the future, it will not need to be passed by the Legislative Yuan because it falls under the administrative scope. After being passed by the Central Political Council, it can proceed without needing Legislative Yuan approval, unlike the signing of treaties, etc., which require Legislative Yuan passage.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Cooperation Between Telegraph and Telephone Is Actively Underway: A Statement from the Chief Clerk of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is striving to develop the telephone industry. Recently, the Ministry of Communications has been focusing on cooperation across the entire transportation sector. Therefore, the Bureau has now begun to cooperate with the telegraph industry. According to Liu Zenglai, Chief Clerk of the Document Section, as follows:</p>
<p>According to Director Liu, the cooperation between telegraph and telephone: "Recently, the Ministry of Communications, in order to promote the development of the entire transportation industry and to facilitate the public, plans for cooperation between the telegraph and telephone industries. Telegraph services are often established in larger cities, but the receiving and sending stations in these cities are not always widespread. Therefore, the first step of cooperation between telegraph and telephone has begun. For example, registered telegrams can now use telephone numbers. Telegram senders who have registered and prepaid a deposit no longer need to go to the telegraph office counter to send a telegram. They can directly notify the telegraph bureau by telephone, and the telegraph bureau can immediately send it out. In the future, in cities and counties without telegraph bureaus, express mail services will be used instead. If these cities and counties have long-distance telephone service, the telephone can be used instead of telegraph communication." Regarding the telephone issue in areas with cross-border road construction, reports stating that the one-year contract has expired and that the Bureau has notified the concession telephone company to negotiate permanent solutions are inaccurate. The temporary contract signed last April did not specify a time limit. If either party believes that the contract needs to be amended or terminated, they must notify the other party three months in advance. The Bureau is still researching permanent solutions, but no firm agreement has been reached. Therefore, there has been no notification to the other party to negotiate a new agreement.</p>
<p>Xu Xueyu Will Go to Jiangxi: Since taking office, Director Xu Xueyu of the Bureau has been striving to develop the Bureau's operations. Recently, he received an order from the Ministry of Communications to go to Nanchang because the telephone services in Nanchang have been performing poorly due to various reasons. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications intends to order Director Xu to go there to reorganize them. Director Xu is currently arranging everything and will depart for Nanchang at the end of this month, which will take about four months to complete. During his absence, the Bureau's Chief Engineer, Shao Bingjian, will act as Director. However, if Director Xu has any important official matters during these four months, he will return to Shanghai at any time to oversee everything.</p>

<p>Opposing Market Monopoly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Ice Industry Association, believing that some members of the industry have colluded with Japanese individuals to form a cooperative company. At least a few manufacturers, unaware of the dangers, seek only immediate profit and are deceived. If they are controlled by them, there will be no place for Chinese merchants in the ice industry. Therefore, yesterday at 2:00 PM, they hosted the press at the Xinxin Restaurant. More than thirty reporters from various newspapers attended. Qin Xin, a representative of the Association, reported the truth and requested assistance. The original text is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Representative's Report <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Last year, our industry learned that Fu Zhiqin, the manager of the Oriental Ice Factory (Japanese-owned), Gu Fuxiang of the Weisheng Dining Company at the Jin Shenfu Road and Kuanchang Road intersection, Hu Huiqing of the Tongji Ice Company, Gao Abing, Qian Acai, the owner of the Shen He Tai Fruit Shop, Da Bao Xu Heshan, Chen Lianglang, and Xu Afu planned for several months and negotiated an agreement in March. They raised tens of thousands of yuan, of which Gu Fuxiang contributed 20,000 yuan and Qian Acai 15,000 yuan, and organized a wholesale center for machine-made ice on Hanbi Li Road in the city center. It opened on April 16 this year. The person in charge of the cooperative company told our distributors that the price from the 21st of this month would be nine yuan per ton, and from May 1st, it would be seventeen yuan per ton. After Fu Zhiqin and others formed the cooperative company, they signed contracts with Quanhu Ji Dahua, Qiahe, Maochang, Yongxin, Xiemao, and Xin Maochang ice factories to exclusively sell their products to Guangyi Qialong and Yu Ice Factory, providing subsidies. Guangyi received a subsidy of 5,280 yuan, and Qialong received 10,000 yuan. The entire Shanghai market knows this.</p>
<h3 id="e123">List of Ice Factories <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The names, addresses, output, and nationality of the various factories in Shanghai are listed below for reference: (1) Oriental Ice Factory, Manager Fu Zhiqin, Japanese, Yangshupu Road, daily output 80 tons; (2) Shanghai Ice Factory, Comprador Lu Wenqi, British, Tangen Road, daily output 80 tons; (3) Dahua Ice Factory, Owner Yu Wenhao, Chinese, Zhapu Road, daily output more than 30 tons; (4) Qiahe Ice Factory, Owner Li Yongtang, Chinese, Huangpu Road, daily output more than 10 tons; (5) Maochang Ice Factory, Chinese, Minhang Road, daily output more than 10 tons; (6) Hongchang Ice Factory, Chinese, Miller Road, daily output more than 10 tons; (7) Yongxin Ice Factory, Chinese, Zhoujiazui Road, daily output 15 tons; (8) Xiemao Ice Factory, Manager Li Yongtang, Chinese, Shipu, daily output 17 tons; (9) Xin Maochang Factory, Chinese, Shipu, daily output more than 10 tons; (10) Guangyi Ice Factory, Chinese, Longhua Road, daily output 17 tons; (11) Qialong Ice Factory, Chinese, Kangnaotuo Road, daily output more than 10 tons.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Truth About the Dispute <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Our colleagues in Shanghai make a living selling various types of ice with small capital. In the past, businesses engaged in free competition. Manufacturers, sellers, and consumers formed a trinity. In the past, the ice supplied to consumers was sold at a contract price of up to nine to ten yuan per ton, maintaining its equilibrium and never exceeding the norm, directly harming consumers and indirectly increasing the social price index, resulting in abnormal conditions. At this time of national crisis, when the country is in danger, all of our people should unite to save China. However, traitors and evil-doers continue to emerge. The northeastern four provinces recognized the enemy as their father, but Shanghai, a major port, also has shameless elements like Fu Zhiqin (the manager of the Japanese-owned Oriental Ice Factory), Gu Fuxiang, Gao Abing, Hu Huiqing, Shen Acai, etc., who cunningly established a cooperative company. They have long harbored ambitions and signed contracts with Dahua Qiahe and other ice factories to exclusively sell their entire output, monopolizing our country's ice market and manipulating ice prices. They gave large subsidies to ice factories such as Qialong as a condition for ceasing operations. Therefore, various ice factories refused orders from colleagues, forcing colleagues to sell to the trust cooperative company. Since its opening, the ice price has suddenly increased from eight or nine yuan to about seventeen yuan, and who knows where it will end up. The Japanese merchants, who are omnipresent, have completely exposed their actions of using Chinese merchants to establish a so-called cooperative company.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Opposing Monopoly <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Our industry believes that the trust (cooperative company) is monopolizing the ice market (special telegram on the 23rd), manipulating ice prices, directly trampling on commerce, destroying the livelihood of peddlers, and indirectly squeezing consumers. For the sake of the country's market and the public's cost of living, it is difficult for our colleagues to remain silent. They have formed representative groups and petitioned the Party and government authorities and municipal chambers of commerce and citizens' associations, demanding that Fu Zhiqin, who colluded with Japanese merchants to establish the trust cooperative company, be thoroughly investigated. They want to maintain national rights and ensure that Chinese-owned ice factories resume operations so that Japanese merchants cannot use their tricks. Under the clear sky and bright sun, our industry is temporarily based on our position to serve the country. However, this is an extraordinary event, and our abilities are limited. We humbly request that all sectors provide righteous assistance so that we can reverse this wild tide. We restate that our work involves fighting the trust head-on to achieve a final victory and striving to awaken industry unity to build a public industry for our colleagues. Our industry is oppressed by the trust and will inevitably sit and wait for death. We must strengthen our organization and seek a thorough solution to find a bright path. Our industry is fortunate, and society is fortunate. (A statement was also issued yesterday; due to its length, it is omitted).</p>

<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai submitted a petition to Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating: "Petition regarding the injury of a Chinese national by Japanese military street combat exercises; requesting your office to lodge a serious negotiation to protect the lives of the people. The 19th District Branch of this Federation reported that at 5:45 AM on the 19th, the Japanese Imperial Navy Marines conducted live-fire street combat tactics in the key areas of the eastern section of Yangshupu, causing deafening explosions that awakened residents from their sleep. Wu Xihai, a 28-year-old employee of the Federation's Dahua Shoe Store, heard the noise and opened the door to look outside. As soon as he stepped out, he was shot in the right chest by a stray bullet, causing profuse bleeding. Subsequently, the Yangshupu Police Station sent detectives to transport him to the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road for treatment, where his life is in danger. We earnestly request a negotiation to protect the lives of the people. The Japanese imperialist army, using the Concession as a shield, dares to freely conduct live-fire military exercises in the bustling city, acting lawlessly as if to demonstrate their power and treating the lives of citizens like dirt. In the future, the lives of citizens living in the Concession will be unimaginable. This matter concerns the prestige and sovereignty of the nation and must be brought to the attention of your office. We request that your office lodge a protest with the authorities and ensure that the Japanese military will no longer arbitrarily conduct landing exercises, so as to prevent future injuries. The issue of compensation for the damages suffered by Wu Xihai, who was injured by the Japanese military, is reasonably documented and presented to your office for prompt negotiation to achieve the goal of protecting the lives of the people. We are extremely grateful for your kindness."</p>

<h3 id="e131">Municipal Government Announcement <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government announcement: The Zhabei</p>
<p>Rice Market Wharf rice transportation dispute</p>
<p>has been repeatedly addressed by the Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters. It is widely believed that the crux of this case lies in the employment of foremen by various firms and factories without paying them wages. Therefore, to fundamentally resolve the dispute, firms and factories should pay wages to the foremen they employ and should not use the contracting system again to avoid exploitation. This has been approved by the trade associations involved. It is easy to bear the very small cost of paying wages to the foremen. A resolution has been made, and orders have been given in batches to comply and report accordingly. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau continues to report, having consulted again with the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters to determine seven implementation measures.

<p>Huang Jintao, Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, came to Shanghai on official business the other day and discussed the reorganization of the Kailuan Coal Mining Company. He said that the Kailuan Mining Bureau was jointly organized by the British-owned Kaiping Mining Company and the Chinese-owned Luanzhou Mining Company. For more than twenty years, the Bureau has based its operations on a joint contract and has never complied with the Mining Law promulgated by the government. Despite repeated urging by the government, there have been no results. Moreover, the interests and authority of the Chinese and British companies within the Bureau have always been unequal, which is unreasonable. The Bureau's internal organization has now been agreed upon to ensure that the interests, responsibilities, and authority of the two companies are equal and to comply with the Mining Law promulgated by the government, like other companies. From now on, the 20-year-old unresolved case of the Bureau can be considered resolved. He also said that the recent labor unrest in Kailuan resulted in losses of about 750,000 yuan, according to the report from Kailuan Manager Nelson to the Ministry. Kailuan's current assets total 11 million yuan. It is also heard that Director Huang will go to the United States to inspect industries and will set sail on the "Empress of Canada" on the 6th of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Representatives of the Silk and Satin Industry Return to Shanghai; The Ministry of Industry Has Accepted All Requested Points; The Outcome Is Quite Satisfactory <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Silk and Satin Trade Association and the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association of this city, because the silk and satin transported and sold to Guangzhou were detained by the Zhongxing Company, which was contracted to collect a special tax on imported foreign cloth in Guangdong Province, totaling three or four thousand pieces, suffered a significant blow in this time of utter devastation for the Jiangzhe silk industry. They sent representatives Lou Fengshao, Gao Shiheng, Pan Runsheng, Chen Yusheng, Deng Hanchen, Chen Weiwo, Qian Boxi, and others to Beijing to petition. It has now been learned that they returned to Shanghai the other day (22nd). According to a reporter from the Yu Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Industry has accepted all requested points and telegraphed the Southwest authorities yesterday to expedite the release of the goods. Therefore, the outcome of this trip is very satisfactory. The telegram and the original text of the Association's submission to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ministry of Industry's Telegram to the Southwest <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>To the Guangdong Provincial Government:</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Silk and Satin</p>
<p>Trade Association and others, the silk woven with</p>
<p>domestic fabrics transported from Shanghai to Guangdong has recently been</p>
<p>classified by the Guangdong Zhongxing Company as</p>
<p>foreign goods, requiring a special tax to be paid, and many pieces have been detained. Please maintain [the policy]. The representatives sent a petition to the Ministry. After investigation, silk fabrics manufactured with foreign raw materials by national factories do meet the provisional standards for domestic goods and are not imported goods and therefore are not within the scope of the special tax collection. We specifically telegraph you to thoroughly investigate and order their release and hope to hear from you.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Submissions from the Two Guilds <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully submitted, it is the case that our guilds previously reported that shipments of domestically produced silk fabrics from Guangdong were being detained by Guangdong and the Zhongyu Company, labeled as foreign goods, and subject to special taxes before release. After requesting the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to issue a letter of certification and requesting their return, not only were they not returned, but an additional three thousand bolts or more were detained. Consequently, merchants from Guangdong urgently telegraphed to cease shipments and suspend business. The members of our guilds were greatly alarmed upon hearing this news and collectively requested support. Upon investigation, domestically produced silk, in recent years, has been subjected to the pressure of imported goods dumping from abroad and the losses from labor disputes internally, leading to shop closures and factory bankruptcies, occurrences that are frequently heard of. Furthermore, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, various industries have become even more depressed, and the market is in a severe slump. Especially those engaged in the domestic silk business are nearing their demise with little hope of development. Even the farmers engaged in sericulture and mulberry tree cultivation are angrily considering cutting down the mulberry trees and abandoning silkworm rearing. Investigating the collapse of the rural economy, it is not without a major cause. Therefore, our industry, recognizing that pure silk fabrics cannot compete with imported goods, has been compelled to use some imported rayon as raw material to create blended silk fabrics to eke out a living. Rayon, in today's world, has become almost a necessity for domestic silk raw materials because our country has no substitutes and it has the special effect of being dyed in two colors. Therefore, blended silk fabrics have long been legally designated as Grade Four domestic goods according to the Provisional Standards for Identification of Domestic Goods. However, the Zhongyu Company, which handles special taxes on foreign cloth, does not distinguish between domestically produced silk fabrics that are entirely funded by Chinese capital, managed by Chinese, and produced by Chinese factories, arbitrarily detaining them and claiming that taxes must be paid before they can be released. We believe that the company is currently established to levy special taxes on foreign goods and absolutely should not do this. Moreover, since the import tax on rayon has been increased twice, the cost of domestic silk has increased, and export sales have sharply declined. The sales volume of silk factories that are now struggling to maintain themselves is only about two or three tenths of what it was in previous years, and sales to Guangzhou account for the majority of that. If a transit tax is imposed on woven bolts and domestically produced blended silk fabrics, not only will the tens of millions of domestic silk transactions that are sold annually to Guangzhou be completely eliminated, but also the millions of workers and merchants who depend on the silk industry for their livelihood will also perish together. The company's far-fetched and distorted interpretation is pushing domestic silk goods into a dead end. We dare to ask, are there any survivors among the dying silk industry workers and merchants? Fortunately, your association's regular meeting on April 17th resolved that the many donations and taxes collected by merchants are quite disruptive to business, and the provincial government ordered the finance department to thoroughly rectify the situation. This demonstrates your association's great concern for the people's suffering and consideration for the merchants' difficulties. In addition to having the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce separately telegraph to request release, we respectfully submit a document detailing the decline of domestic silk fabrics, the inevitable hardship of using some imported raw materials, and the various reasons why the Ministry's order designated them as Grade Four domestic goods. We hereby submit this document to your association for review and urge you to promptly order the Zhongxing Company to release all the detained domestic silk fabrics in order to maintain the domestic silk business and secure the livelihood of workers and merchants. This would be a public convenience. Respectfully submitted to Chen, Chairman of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Submits to Zhejiang Authorities for Relief in Cocoon Collection to Maintain the Rural Economy; Requests Government to Guarantee Loans to Money Shops <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Federation, due to the sharp drop in European and American silk markets and the disappearance of Chinese silk exports, resulting in cocoon merchants going bankrupt, yesterday especially submitted a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Construction and Finance Departments for relief and requested them to guarantee loans to silver and money shops. The original submission stated, "Submitted for the purpose of requesting relief for cocoon collection in order to maintain the rural economy. It is the case that this year, European and American silk markets continue to plummet, and exports have disappeared. The cocoon industry, due to its connection with the silk industry, even sells at a loss, which is not easy. Cocoon merchants are going bankrupt, and debts are piling up. The silkworm season for this year has ended, and no one has inquired about cocoon collection. New cocoons will soon be on the market. If substantial relief is not provided, farmers will have no way to sell their cocoons, and their livelihoods will be at stake. There is a risk of them being driven to desperation, and crises are lurking everywhere. Therefore, the association convened a general meeting of all member representatives on April 11 to discuss emergency measures. It was unanimously agreed that, being on the verge of bankruptcy themselves, they are unable to engage in further operations. They unanimously requested the government to provide substantial relief. Two measures were discussed and decided as follows: (1) Cocoon collecting merchants should prepare a 20% deposit and request the government to guarantee loans to silver and money shops. (2) If the above measure encounters difficulties and cannot be implemented, the provincial government should issue a general order to all counties, requiring the county government to work with the cocoon industry association or office to stipulate the use of promissory notes for cocoon collection. Cocoon collecting merchants should still prepare a 20% deposit to use the promissory notes, and they must all follow this procedure, with responsibility for collecting the cocoons within two months. With the above measures, the government does not need to provide cash relief, and the cocoon merchants will be able to accept any operating losses. According to the first measure, the government only needs to provide a guarantee to silver and money shops, and the loans can be quickly raised. Even if it is difficult to implement, the second measure, using promissory notes for cocoon collection, would provide a credit margin for merchants based on the credit of the merchant association. They would be able to act cautiously due to their own interests, and with the county governments supervising nearby and with the dared-to-buy cocoons as collateral, they would be responsible for collecting the cocoons within a short period of two months, so there seems to be no harm. Farmers can use this to offset debts to shops, and it can be used as cash, so they will not feel inconvenienced. Now that the government has no funds available and the cocoon merchants are heavily indebted, it is clear that providing relief for cocoon collection is the same as providing relief for rural areas. However, without rice, it is difficult to cook, and they can only sigh helplessly. Therefore, using promissory notes for cocoon collection is truly an urgent measure. Moreover, once cocoon collection is solved, the price of silk cocoons can also be stabilized. This is an urgent submission, and it is hoped that your government and departments will consider the advantages and disadvantages, weigh the urgency, and approve the adoption of the measures. The livelihoods of the farmers and the remnants of the cocoon industry truly depend on it.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Ministry of Transportation Orders Navigation Administration Bureau to Strictly Enforce Inspection of Foreign Vessels; Handle According to the Provisions of the Shipping Law; to Maintain Sovereignty and Emphasize Laws <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation instructed the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, stating, "The Ministry convened a navigation administration discussion meeting, and the Weihaiwei Office proposed that since the Shipping Law came into effect on July 1, 1931, it has been three years, and all Chinese merchants have complied with the regulations. However, foreign merchant ships have not yet complied with the provisions of Articles 17 and 22 of the Shipping Law. The Ministry of Transportation should formulate measures to strictly enforce the law. The conference resolved to handle the case. It is stipulated in Articles 17 and 22 of the Shipping Law that the master of a foreign ship departing from a Chinese port carrying passengers or goods should submit the ship's inspection certificate and tonnage certificate to the competent shipping authority of the port for verification, or the authority should conduct an inspection. However, foreign ships have not yet followed these procedures, which is contrary to the law. In the future, regarding these foreign ships, it is necessary to order them to comply with the provisions of Articles 17 and 22 of the Shipping Law in order to maintain sovereignty. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Finance to instruct foreign shipping companies to comply, and issuing separate orders, the bureau is hereby ordered to notify all subordinates of this order."</p>

<h3 id="e149">Postal and Telecommunications Associations Submit Request to Stop the Joint Establishment of Postal and Telecommunications Offices <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of convenience for the people and saving expenses, the Ministry of Transportation has been piloting the joint establishment of postal and telecommunications offices in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei for more than a month. According to news from the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications Associations, difficulties have arisen since the implementation of this matter in various places, and it is difficult to implement the purpose of facilitating the people and saving expenses. The two associations have submitted a joint request to the Ministry, asking them to withdraw the order for the joint establishment of postal and telecommunications offices, for the sake of saving the authorities from wasteful expenses. The document stated, "The case of postal and telecommunications cooperation has been decided by your ministry to be piloted in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei and the two cities of Shanghai and Peiping from March 15th, merging the business of postal and telecommunications offices of the third class and below, and the principle is that the combined expenses after the merger should not exceed the original amount before the merger. Your ministry has made every effort to carry out this case, and the main purpose is to facilitate the people and save expenses. The two associations deeply admire this. However, when merging, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether the financial resources of both parties will not be wasted and whether business administration will be unhindered. The two associations have received many reports from postal and telecommunications workers' associations in various places, describing the various difficulties encountered when local postal and telecommunications offices are merged. Summarizing and listing them, there are approximately the following points: 1. The postal and telecommunications offices were originally set up in two different places. Now, due to the merger, it is necessary to merge the post office into the telegraph office or the telegraph office into the post office. However, the addresses of both offices are mostly only sufficient for one office. If they want to merge, they must find new premises. It is extremely difficult to find premises that are suitably located and have low rents, as either the rent is expensive (exceeding the sum of the original rents of the two offices) or the location is remote (inconvenient for the people). It is very difficult to take into account the ministry's aim of benefiting the people and saving costs. 2. Most of the original office buildings of the postal and telecommunications offices are rented from private individuals, and most of them have contracts with stipulated terms. Now, due to the merger and relocation to a new address, both parties must negotiate a termination of the contract with the original landlord, resulting in disputes or losses, which have occurred in various places. 3. The postal and telecommunications departments are not under the same management. After the merger, conflicts will inevitably occur in the division of responsibilities, and it will be difficult to allocate responsibilities. Furthermore, the office hours are not uniform, and the complexity of the work is also different. After the merger, the two parties will inevitably hinder each other, and the efficiency of work will be reduced. 4. The expenses of the postal and telecommunications offices originally varied greatly. After the merger, all expenses such as water, electricity, and fuel cannot be managed separately. However, if they are borne equally, it is difficult to grasp when preparing the budget, and when the personnel of the two offices are placed together, there is room for both parties to shirk responsibility, and the expenses will inevitably increase waste. All of these are factual difficulties, and if any one of them exists, it is sufficient to be detrimental to the merger. There are many similar difficulties in other places, and disputes arising in the administrative system and procedures are to be expected. Furthermore, the people in the interior do not need the convenience of the postal and telecommunications offices at the same time. Generally speaking, there are more times when letters are sent than when telegrams are sent, so the telegraph office may be located in a slightly remote place, while the post office must be located in a busy area. If they are located in the same place, they must be in a busy area, but the convenience for the people is minimal, and the expenses such as rent are more wasteful than when they are located separately. The personnel of the postal and telecommunications offices have different backgrounds and different concepts, and it does not seem easy to have harmonious opinions and merge with each other. If unexpected conflicts occur in the future, it would not be a blessing for either the postal or telecommunications offices. In short, the various obstacles that have already been seen at the beginning of this pilot project of postal and telecommunications cooperation indicate that the result will be more harmful than beneficial, and it will be even further from your ministry's aim of facilitating the people and saving expenses. We earnestly request your ministry to make a decisive decision and promptly withdraw the order so as to avoid the unnecessary waste of spirit and financial resources. I cannot express my earnestness and await your orders. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<p>Mr. Lin Aimin, manager of the Nanyang Singapore Star Daily, returned to China this time under the orders of Mr. Hu Wenhu, chairman of the newspaper, to investigate news, education, construction, and to negotiate the promotion of domestic goods to Nanyang. He has been entrusted with important tasks and has been warmly welcomed by all sectors since arriving in Shanghai. He has been quite busy with social engagements. In recent days, he has visited the Shen, Xin, Shi, and Chen newspaper offices, as well as domestic goods manufacturers, schools, and organizations. Recently, due to important matters, he needed to contact Zeng Yangfu, director of the Zhejiang Construction Department.

After returning to Shanghai, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo was ordered to go to Nanyang for inspection. Lin and He Zhuolan, director of the Trademark Bureau, went to Chen's residence to discuss issues related to the revitalization of industry and the fact that overseas Chinese in Nanyang have been suffering from political and economic oppression in recent years and are on the verge of bankruptcy.

<h3 id="e154">Report of Airplane Accident in Minhang; Inquiries to Relevant Parties Reveal No Knowledge <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, yesterday a reporter received information from a certain Westerner stating that a Chinese airplane crashed suddenly while flying over Minhang last Saturday. The pilot was seriously injured and was being transported by the police when he died. Therefore, reporters yesterday inquired with the Municipal Public Security Bureau and relevant aviation agencies, all of whom stated that they had not received such a report. According to Mr. Lin Wo Jiang of the China Aviation Association, if an airplane were coming from Hangzhou, there would definitely be a telegram report in advance. An investigation revealed that no airplane came from Hangzhou on Saturday, so they were unaware of the matter. It was also said that the crashed airplane was No. 19, and someone witnessed the accident. Therefore, it is generally expected that the crash site is within the Shanghai County, so the municipal authorities have not yet received a report of the accident.</p>

The estimated value of the items inside was over 200,000 yuan. She reported this to the police and filed a public lawsuit. The Second Special District Court found that the crime occurred in the Public Concession and ordered the case transferred to the First Special District Court, with bail set at 50,000 yuan.

<p>Zhabei Public Bus Company Petitions the Municipal Government for Punishment of Assailants and Compensation; Detailed Account of Driver and Employee Beatings; Workers Request Six Items to be Handled First</p>
<p>Drivers and ticket sellers of the Zhabei Public Bus Company were injured by soldiers of the Security Team at Jiangwan earlier this month. The next day, all workers of the bus company went on a half-day strike. Mayor Wu ordered Wen Hong'en Bureau and Chen Battalion Commander of the Security Team to go to offer condolences, and work was temporarily resumed. Yesterday, the company again petitioned the Municipal Public Utility Bureau Director Xu Peihuang to forward to Mayor Wu a request for the swift fulfillment of six conditions, including a thorough investigation of the assailants and compensation for losses. Their original petition is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the company's employees being assaulted by Security Team soldiers and thugs, requesting a report to the Municipal Government for a thorough investigation and legal action to ensure protection. According to the report from the company's transportation section chief, Xiang Ti, at 5:00 PM on the 19th of this month, Public Bus No. 4933 on Route 4, traveling from the North Station towards the Municipal Government along Tiyu Hui Road, in front of the company's entrance, ticket inspector Qian Yabing boarded the bus and found a Security Team soldier named Ji who refused to purchase a ticket. The ticket inspector ordered him to buy a ticket, but Ji refused and instead dragged the inspector off the bus and beat him, causing injuries. At the same time, three soldiers from the same unit joined in the assault. At that moment, a Public Bus traveling from the Municipal Government to the North Station arrived at the scene. Ticket inspector Zhang Meixin, seeing the incident, got off the bus to mediate and was also attacked by the four soldiers, injuring his right hand. At that time, Zhang Tingrong from the Municipal Government's Intelligence Department passed by in a car, ordered the soldiers to quickly take the offending soldier to the Fifth District Fifth Precinct and hand him over to the station chief. At 6:30 PM, Public Bus No. 4932 on Route 4, Song's shift, returned from the city to the North Station. There were 12 passengers on board. When the bus arrived in front of the Seventh District Second Precinct, at the company's stop, a passenger got off the bus. Just as the driver, Zhu A'gen, was about to start the bus, dozens of thugs who had gathered there surrounded the bus, preventing it from moving forward. They swarmed onto the bus and first dragged the shift closing clerk Huang Riguang, who was standing at the bus door, out of the bus and beat him severely, causing serious injuries to his head and chest. He cried out for help, but no one paid attention. He fled, in pain, to the Seventh District Precinct for help, but was refused. The driver, sitting in the driver's seat, was also assaulted by several thugs with fists and feet. Fortunately, bystanders intervened, preventing serious injury. The ticket seller, Wang Shuyun, hid inside the bus among the passengers, but was dragged out and beaten severely. The beating lasted for about ten minutes. All employees saw that the incident was bizarre and obviously intentional, and the fact that it happened in front of the police station responsible for maintaining local security made them feel even more threatened. To protect the safety of all workers, they came to the company requesting a practical guarantee, saying that unless a satisfactory solution was found, they would not be able to drive the buses on time. To maintain transportation, the company tried to persuade them and finally got them to agree to continue operating Routes 1 and 3 as usual. The service personnel on Route 4 refused to accept the arrangement. (The company, seeing the situation escalating, had the general manager Huang Zhongwen go to the Municipal Bureau to explain the situation in person, and immediately accompanied representatives from the worker's union to the Municipal Government to report the incident, seeking a proper resolution. The director conveyed the message to the mayor, requesting a thorough investigation and a quick restoration of service on Route 4, with the Public Security Bureau assigning police to protect each bus. At 3:00 PM, Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau, accompanied by Chen Zhuomin, commander of the Security Team, came to the company, personally inspected the scene of the incident, and questioned the captain of the Third Squad of the Public Security Bureau and the injured driver, Zhu A'gen. He instructed the workers to first restore transportation on Route 4, and promised to take responsibility for punishing the assailants and ensuring future safety. The workers followed the instructions and restored service on Route 4 at 4:00 PM. This is the real situation of that day. However, the Sixth District Public Bus Industry Workers' Union, to achieve a complete solution and ensure future protection, listed six demands and requested the company to petition the Municipal Government for practical guarantees. The company now submits the details of the injuries sustained by the company employees while on duty, along with the six demands for protection from the worker's union (The six demands are as follows:) (1) Remove and investigate Pei, the captain of the Third Squad of the Police; (2) Guarantee the safety of the injured (assume full responsibility in case of disability or death); (3) Be responsible for all medical expenses and losses; (4) Ensure that similar incidents do not happen again; (5) Investigate and punish the assailants; (6) Reply to the above items within five days. The company respectfully submits this petition to the Municipal Public Utility Bureau Director Xu, requesting that he forward it to the Municipal Government to consider the difficulties, thoroughly investigate and punish the assailants, in order to appease public anger and ensure protection for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to Xu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Bureau.</p>

<p>Chen Wancai, a boy from Jiangbei, lost his father at a young age, and his mother suffered from foot ailments. They lived in poverty. Therefore, Chen was sent to Shanghai to be raised by his aunt, Chen Sunshi. Chen Sunshi was also a widow, and without children, she treated Wancai as her own, cherishing him dearly. She raised him painstakingly, and now Wancai is sixteen years old. She entrusted someone to find him a job, and a few days ago, he was introduced to work as an apprentice at the Xinmin Barber Shop, located at 1216 Xiaoshadu Road, owned by Zhang Xiluo from Yangzhou. However, on the 19th of this month, Zhang suddenly discovered that 20 yuan had been stolen and suspected Chen Wancai of the theft. He colluded with a shop worker, Wang Lisong, and around midnight, they tied Wancai's thumbs with a rope and suspended him from the window ledge outside the third floor, inflicting cruel torture. They used dusters, rattan canes, and broom handles to beat him violently, forcing him to confess. Wancai cried out in agony, his voice audible outside. He was covered in wounds, especially on his face. This kind of inhuman act is not allowed by law, but Zhang and others did not stop there. The next day, they even led Chen Wancai to his aunt's home to search. However, they found nothing. Chen Sunshi saw her nephew covered in wounds and could not bear it. She reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Station, and yesterday morning, requested the First Special Court to summon the shop owner Zhang Xiluo and shop worker Wang Lisong to the criminal court. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, stated the facts and filed a lawsuit for the crime of injury under Article 294 of the criminal law, requesting investigation. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned both parties and ordered the two defendants, Zhang and Wang, to post 1,000 yuan bail and adjourned the hearing. Chen Wancai was ordered to go to the court's forensic department for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Carpenter Shop Owner Beats Apprentice to Death; Autopsy Reveals Broken Hand Bone; Shop Owner to be Prosecuted by Police <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Wan Xiaokang, a thirteen-year-old from Chongming, was an apprentice at the Gu Cai Carpentry Shop, owned by Gu Mucai from Pudong, located at 240 Annan Road. The shop owner was known to be fierce and would often beat the apprentices severely if they did not follow his instructions. Last December, Wan was beaten severely by Gu with bamboo sticks for being slightly lazy at work, causing him to be covered in wounds and in great pain. His right arm was particularly badly injured, and he could not move it from then on. He also could not eat or drink, and was fed by another apprentice, Yao Fangqing. However, in the past ten days or so, his injuries worsened, and he ate less and less. Gu, seeing his condition deteriorating, ordered Yao to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment around 8:00 AM on the 20th of this month. The treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and detectives Hu Zhiyun and others went to investigate. They arrested Gu Mucai and apprentices Yao Fangqing, Zhou Chonggou, etc., and brought them to the police station. After questioning, the police chief ordered their detention and had Wan's body taken to the forensic laboratory on Feilun Road. The day before yesterday, Guo Wei, prosecutor of the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and court clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the laboratory to examine the body. Yao Fangqing, 17 years old, from Haimen, who claimed to be an apprentice at the Gu Cai Carpentry Shop at 240 Annan Road, testified that last December, the boss beat the deceased, hitting his arm with a bamboo head and holding his right hand to prevent him from moving it. The deceased then said that his arm hurt, and he could not eat after that, so I often fed him. Zhou Chonggou's testimony was the same as Yao's. Gu Mucai testified that the Gu Cai Shop was opened by him, and he was 43 years old. The deceased was his apprentice, and he did hit his arm last year, but he later developed wind paralysis, which caused his hand to be unable to move, etc. The rest of his testimony was evasive. To clarify the truth, the prosecutor ordered forensic doctors Wei and Zhang to dissect the body. The autopsy revealed that the right hand bone was broken and there were many wounds. It was determined that the deceased, Wan Xiaokang, died from injuries sustained during his lifetime. Gu Mucai was suspected of committing a crime and should be prosecuted by the police and sent to court for review. The body was handed over to Wang Qi for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>

<p>Zhou E'xuan, the son of the wealthy Zhou Weishi, was recently sued by Zhang Zhuying for abandoning his biological son, Du Nan (also known as Da Yuan). The Criminal Simplified Court of the First Special District Court heard the case and ordered Zhou to post 20,000 yuan bail and transfer the case to the Local Court for trial. Zhou hired lawyer Huang Ziyan for defense. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Ze Han announced the verdict yesterday morning: Zhou E'xuan was found not guilty, and the counterclaim was dismissed.</p>

<p>Chen Zaishan, a native of this county, had two sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Jinhua, died early, leaving behind two grandsons, Wenbo and Wenyue. The second son is Genhua, and the three daughters are all married: the eldest to Zhu, the second to Chi, and the youngest to Zhang. Zaishan died of illness on July 21st of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], leaving behind real estate of more than seven mu of land, valued at over 400,000 yuan, at Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road, which was managed by his wife, Tang. Tang died on November 3rd of last year. Zhu Chenshi and Chi Chenshi, the two sisters, expressed their disagreement. After mediation, Genhua sold 1.8 mu of land at Tongfu Road for 60,000 yuan, gave 30,000 yuan and a bungalow to them, and settled the matter, stipulating that they should not make further claims.</p>
<p>Later, they hired lawyer Gu Bing to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court, suing Chen Genhua, Chen Wenbo, and Chen Wenyue, requesting that the property left by their late father, Chen Zaishan, consisting of more than six mu of land, be divided into three shares, with the plaintiffs receiving one-third. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Changzi opened Civil Court 11 to summon the defendants, but they did not appear. The court stated that the object of the plaintiff's claim had not been determined and should be examined to determine the litigation costs. The plaintiffs were asked about the market value per mu of the land they were requesting to be divided, and they replied that it was about 30,000 yuan. The court stated that the land sold earlier was worth 60,000 yuan, so the object of this case was worth more than 360,000 yuan. It was therefore necessary to investigate the land price with the Public Works Department, and the hearing was adjourned.</p>

After questioning, they learned that their accomplice, Wang Wenhua, from Jiangbei, lived at 21 Bailu Road in Zhabei. Around 3 PM, they planned to go to Room 2 of the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to talk. The detectives went to the hotel and waited. When Wang arrived, they arrested him. He confessed that he had three pistols hidden in the roof wall of his home. The detectives secretly went to his house with detectives from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau and found the pistols, which were temporarily stored at the police station. They also seized seven large chests of stolen goods, including jewelry, clothing, and alarm clocks, at the Jusheng Hotel, owned by Li Gansheng, located at 87 Bailinan Road in the same district. They also searched Tu Xiang's home at 159 Galle Road in the French Concession and found some stolen goods. Li and the other three were taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Public Works Department lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the facts and requested an adjournment for further investigation. When questioned, Li Gansheng confessed that he had committed three burglaries in the past year, but could not specify the locations. He also stated that he had obtained the three pistols from somewhere about two years ago. On the 15th of this month, he took the guns to Wang Wenhua's house for safekeeping. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Tu Xiangping confessed that he had stolen with Li twice, but knew nothing about the pistols. Wang Wenhua confessed that when the pistols were brought to his house, he was out, and only learned about them from his wife later. He asked for leniency. Judge Wu Zehan ordered that they be detained and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>In recent days, many people have come to renew their licenses, but there are still a few who have not been able to go due to the distance or because they have moved and have not yet been informed. It is heard that to remedy the situation, the bureau has now extended the license renewal period by ten days, until the 30th of this month. All old licenses will be considered invalid after that date.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Publishes; Answers to Questions about Stamp Tax; Also Describes How to Appeal Against Penalties <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Stamp tax is an obligation that merchants must fulfill. However, although the temporary regulations on stamp tax promulgated by the National Government adopt the principle of enumeration, the provisions are too simple. Therefore, merchants often incorrectly affix stamps to ledgers and documents. Due to temporary negligence, they may incur a hundredfold penalty, which is regrettable. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has compiled a book entitled "Answers to Questions about Stamp Tax" for merchants to use as a reference. The book is divided into fifteen categories: 1. Bills of exchange; 2. Ledgers; 3. Invoices; 4. Tax bills and certificates; 5. License fees; 6. Receipts and letters; 7. Books and gift certificates; 8. Transportation and customs declarations; 9. Real estate and rent; 10. Tobacco, alcohol, salt, coal, and oil; 11. Application documents; 12. Explanation of questions; 13. Penalties; 14. Regulations; 15. Miscellaneous items. A total of eighty items. At the end, it also describes in detail how to appeal against penalties. The book has now been published and sells for 15 cents per copy. It can be purchased from the Chamber of Commerce Monthly Journal.</p>

His wife, Han Tengshi, was his original match. He and Tang Zhaokun had been childhood friends and old neighbors since childhood, with his house about a dozen houses away from mine.

<p>I encountered the two of them at</p>
<p>the Siming Hotel at the Xixinqiao Zilaihuo street corner.</p>
<p>I immediately rebuked Tang, based on brotherly righteousness, and he left. I took my wife home and naturally scolded her. Then he told my wife to report to the Third District that I wanted a divorce. The patrol officer came to investigate, realized the situation, and sent my wife back. However, he continued to repeatedly seduce her, so my family had daily</p>

<p>and said not to argue anymore, and that they would not</p>

<p>wife to work in Yangshupu. But this year, on the tenth day of the lunar first month, he actually talked to my wife at Yangshupu Bridge, which I saw and questioned again. He blushed and left. I felt upset for many days after returning home. Until the eighteenth day of the lunar first month, a friend from a ship said that there were 200 taels of smuggled opium on the ship, and he wanted to go get it, asking to borrow a gun. I didn't have a gun, so I went to Wang Bu Jin's place</p>

<p>on the 24th, I walked past Tang's house.</p>
<p>Tang was eating, and we greeted each other. Then</p>
<p>his wife scolded me, calling me a "stinky turtle." I was very angry, so I took the gun to Tang's place to threaten him. Then he touched my hand, and the bullet shot out, hitting his head by accident. I am not familiar with guns.

<p>couldn't bear to do it, after leaving the door, because you were angry you</p>
<p>went back to threaten him, unexpectedly it triggered and</p>

<p>He replied that he did hit me, afraid of omitting something. The official cross-examined him again and then asked Han Tengshi, who said she was 28 years old, that Tang Zhaokun, on June 15, tricked her to the Siming Hotel under the guise of my husband's name for illicit relations. It was Room 22 on the second floor. He changed his first name but not his surname. Until September, he was caught by her husband once, and scolded upon returning. Tang told me to report to the police station. Having killed someone, I wasn't in Pudong until the morning of the 25th, when my husband came to accompany me back to my hometown, staying at the</p>

<p>until being arrested. I never said that</p>
<p>I killed someone, the rest is the same as Han Zhengqing's account.</p>
<p>The official then asked the deceased's family if it was</p>
<p>due to borrowing money and not succeeding. They replied no such thing happened. At this point, the official summoned Detective Gu Liancheng, who testified that he was 46 years old, from Shanghai, and that the arrest of Han Zhengqing and others was based on obtained leads. They were captured the day after the incident. He also brought Han Tengshi to the Siming Hotel to verify that it was Room 22, and that the registration book from June 15th showed Tang Zu Yu, 32 years old, antiques, and the woman's name was changed to Shi. The bellboy recognized that the woman had opened rooms three or four times. The murder weapon has not been found, he said. The deceased's father, Tang, testified that he was 61 years old, and that his son lived at 118 Lajitang, and that they had been living apart for a long time. How he was killed, I do not know. According to my daughter-in-law, Han Zhengqing, Zhou Decheng, and Shen Tong extorted my son, cutting off his financial resources, and borrowed 50 yuan without returning it, and wanted to borrow again, and was killed. The official asked if you</p>

<p>Li Yang and Tian Xiang Silk Stores on Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen, are managed by Zhang Lihong, a Ningbo native. Wang Wenfu, a Haimen native who had been dismissed from Tian Xiang, and Chen Xiaomao, a partner who had left Li Yang, colluded with Peng A'gen, a Haimen native who pulled a rickshaw at Yi Yi Sugar Store on Tang Hang Street, and a Mr. Li, totaling four people. Two weeks ago, they secretly discussed the matter at a tea house near the New Garbage Bridge in the Public Concession. Mr. Li then sent letters to Zhang Lihong, the manager of the silk store, three times, extorting 50,000 yuan. Zhang reported the extortion to Lu Ying, the captain of the Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, and Guan Gong, the district chief of the First District, requesting an investigation. The First District Detective Team, led by Team Leaders Gong Mingde and Han Ruisheng, conducted a thorough investigation. Detectives Yuan Haishan and Yu Maolong discovered that Ma Guiqing, a Suzhou native and hooligan from Xiaodongmen (nicknamed "Little Suzhou"), was suspected of inquiring at the Li Yang Silk Store. They reported this information to their superiors. The night before, Ma Guiqing (Little Suzhou) was apprehended on Minguo Road, across from the Li Yang Silk Store, and brought to the station. During interrogation, Ma confessed to being 23 years old, residing at 8 Chunchang Lane, Ma Yao Lane, Fangbang Road, and admitted to the extortion without hesitation. He also implicated Peng A'gen, a Haimen native who pulled a rickshaw at the Yi Yi Sugar Store on Tang Hang Street, stating that Peng was staying at the Dongfang Hotel, Xiaodongmen, waiting for instructions. The officers escorted Ma to the Dongfang Hotel, Room 53, and arrested Peng A'gen. Peng confessed to being 36 years old, from Haimen, and that Wang Wenfu, a Haimen native who worked at the Jiu Da Hua Ke Company in the Old Zhabei Qiaonan District, had initiated the plan. Team Leaders Dong and Han, along with detectives from the Public Concession, arrested Wang the following day. Wang confessed to being 35 years old, having previously worked at Li Yang and Tian Xiang Silk Stores. Two weeks ago, he, along with Chen Xiaomao and a Mr. Li, who were also from his hometown and currently at large, had discussed the plan at the Laohuzhao tea house near the New Garbage Bridge. Mr. Li wrote letters to Zhang Lihong of Li Yang, extorting 50,000 yuan. He also discussed with Peng A'gen to have him go to Li Yang to negotiate a price of at least 1,000 yuan. Later, because A'gen did not go, Little Suzhou went to negotiate. After the third letter was sent, he, A'gen, and Little Suzhou had tea at the Laohuzhao tea house near the Garbage Bridge and then dispersed. He didn't know where Chen Xiaomao and Mr. Li lived. District Chief Guan, considering the large amount of money involved in the extortion, ordered that Wang Wenfu and the other two criminals be sent to the General Bureau for legal action and ordered the continued pursuit of the remaining accomplices.</p>

<p>Hu A Mao, a local thief, conspired with accomplices in the autumn of last year to rob the Meixing Clock Store at the intersection of Fada Road and Jixiang Street, and the Sihui Clock Store across from the Big Ben, sharing the stolen watches and money. He was apprehended by the French Concession detectives and sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. Because he had also robbed a clock store in the Public Concession, he was transferred by the Public Concession police to the First Special District Court, where he was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Hu appealed the Second Special District Court's verdict to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court approved his request, and on the morning of the 16th of this month, sent court police to the First Special District Court to retrieve Hu and temporarily detain him in the bail room on the upper floor of Courts 7 and 8, waiting for the High Court to hold a hearing in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, at 11 a.m., Hu took advantage of the guard's absence and dared to remove one of the handcuffs he was wearing, pretending to need to urinate. He climbed out of the window on the door and attempted to escape. When he reached the mezzanine, a court policeman, number 515, came upstairs and stopped him, asking where he was going. Hu replied that he was going outside to urinate. When asked why he had removed his handcuffs, Hu was speechless and unable to answer. The policeman knew he was attempting to escape, took him back to the bail room, and reported it to the sergeant, who reported it to the Third Branch of the High Court. That afternoon, when the High Court convened a collegiate bench for the hearing, Hu, knowing that his crime was inescapable, declared in court that he was withdrawing his appeal, and claimed that he had an elderly mother at home with no one to support her, and asked only that the two sentences be combined and reduced. The court verified his statement, granted the withdrawal of the appeal, and ordered him to be returned to custody pending further instructions. Hu was then sent to the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren convened the Second Court and brought Hu in for questioning. Hu claimed that he urgently needed to relieve himself, and because no one answered when he called out, he went downstairs on his own to urinate. He claimed that the handcuffs were loose and slipped off, and that he had no intention of escaping. Policemen number 414, 46, and 12 then testified. The official ruled that Hu would remain in custody pending prosecution and further investigation.</p>

Unexpectedly, he committed suicide by taking poison that night. The next day at noon, the bellboy discovered him and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Doctors confirmed that he had ingested two types of poisons, sleeping pills and heroin, and was in critical condition. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. He died at 11:05 p.m. on the 22nd. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court arrived to examine the body and confirmed that he had died from poisoning. Because there were no relatives, he ordered the body to be photographed and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home. It is now known that the deceased's real name was Li Decheng, 23 years old, from Pinghu, a doctor at Baolong Hospital. His family was quite wealthy. He was very close to his colleague Xu Wenxiang in Shanghai. Recently, he was transferred by a Westerner to work upstairs. Li did not want to resign. He also suffered from scabies and could not find a good partner. He was resentful and took his own life. It is unknown why he borrowed his good friend Xu Wenxiang's name to check into a hotel and commit suicide. The reason for borrowing the name is difficult to understand. His former colleagues learned of the news and rushed to the morgue yesterday afternoon to identify him. They notified the deceased's brother, who will go to the Second Special District Court today to complete the procedures for claiming the body and preparing a coffin for the funeral.</p>

<p>Guo Luman, a Ningbo native, was reported to the police by his legal wife, Han Yueling, last year for marrying female painter Xu Zhiqing as his concubine. A settlement was reached through mediation by relatives and friends, and an agreement was drawn up: (1) All of Guo Luman's real estate property deeds were to be deposited in a bank safe deposit box. Guo Yonglan (Guo's father, a supervisor at the Ningbo Industrial Bank), Guo Luman, and Guo Han's seals were required to open the box, and keys were to be held by Guo Luman and Guo Han separately. (2) The monthly rent received, after deducting 333 yuan for Guo's father and land and housing expenses, was to be divided equally between Guo Luman and Guo Han. The rent would still be collected by Xi Wu and monthly statements would be provided for distribution. (3) Each of Guo Han's daughters would receive a dowry of 6,000 yuan, to be paid from the above-mentioned assets. (4) Guo Luman was to reimburse Guo Han 5,000 yuan for selling pine trees, plus Guo Luman's legal fees and debts, up to a limit of 10,000 yuan, to be paid from the above-mentioned assets. Future expenses were to be paid only with the consent of both parties, etc. After the agreement was signed, Guo Luman mortgaged a piece of land and obtained 27,000 yuan. After paying 15,000 yuan for legal fees for both parties, there was still 12,000 yuan remaining, which was not divided equally with Han as agreed. Also, when Han's eldest daughter got married, Guo only paid 1,000 yuan for dowry, and when her second daughter, Peiyu, got married, he paid nothing. Han claimed that Guo had breached the agreement and hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Che Bingrong to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting that the court order Guo to fulfill all the terms of the agreement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong convened the Sixth Civil Court</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I was shocked to read in your newspaper for several days about the motor pump industry petitioning the Party and government, opposing collusion among industry players, Japanese businessmen monopolizing the market, manipulating water prices, oppressing peddlers, and exploiting users, requesting a stop to it]. Upon investigation, due to the plummeting price of motor-pumped water in recent years, coupled with unpaid debts from peddlers, the industry will be completely at a loss. If no measures are taken to maintain it, what can be imagined? Therefore, industry players have gathered to form "Xiecheng Hao" to rectify industry rules, temporarily not offering credit, and to separately set uniform prices, which will be observed uniformly to avoid chaos, completely for the industry's share of funds, without any foreign shares. Now, unexpectedly, this has dissatisfied a small number of peddlers, who are using oppression as an excuse to damage the reputation of fellow players. In addition to industry players detailing the history and reasons and submitting a document to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting correction, there is a sincere fear that readers will be misled. I have specially sent a letter requesting your newspaper to publish it to correct misinformation. Sincerely, Gu Fuxiang, Wu Weiqing, Shen Jincai, Gao Abing, for the Motor-pump Industry Management, please forward to the chief editor of the Shenbao.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment Thank you for the gift from the Commercial Press of the 32nd volume, 8th issue of Children's World and the 37th issue of Children's Pictorial, thank you.</p>

<p>Regarding the question of how to do a reading report [Explanation of Doubts] in last week's Reading Q&amp;A. Because that does not fall within the scope of Reading Q&amp;A, it was decided to discuss it in this column.</p>
<p>The nature of reading reports can be divided into two types: one is a report on the implementation of a reading plan; the other is a report made after reading a certain book. The former's content includes: ㈠ Did the reading proceed according to the original plan? Were there any changes along the way? ㈡ If it was not implemented, why? If there were changes, why? ㈢ How much of each item in the reading plan was implemented? Which were done? Which were not done? ㈣ Are the books selected in the reading plan suitable? Is the time allocation sufficient? ㈤ Is the result of the implementation of the reading plan satisfactory? Did it achieve the original purpose? If not satisfactory, state the reasons for dissatisfaction and the future direction for improvement. The latter is something like [After Reading]. In this type of report, the following should be mentioned: ㈠ How much time was spent on reading? Was a certain amount of time set for reading each day or did it change, or was it read in one go? Was there any interruption during the reading process? ㈡ Is it possible to understand that book? If not, what is the reason? Is it due to poor writing, obscure translation, or is the content difficult to understand? ㈢ How many books like this have you read? What are the differences between the content of this book and what you have read before? Which one is better? ㈣ What is your personal impression of that book? How much knowledge did you gain? What is your critique of it. The above are just a few simple principles for making reports. If readers have better and more detailed content, they are free to do so without being limited to these few points. We also hope to be given better methods, so that we can share them with other readers for reference.</p>
<p>Also, although the nature of the reports is slightly different, they can be combined into one when making them. Because anyone who has a reading plan will always read some of the books in the plan, unless the plan is not implemented. When making a comprehensive report, in addition to making a general review of the implementation of the entire plan, the research of each item should be described separately, and then the reading report should be inserted. This is more eye-catching and complete than making two reports.</p>
<p>Dear readers, please submit your reports soon! Because by submitting reports, we can encourage ourselves and inspire the interest in reading.</p>
<h3 id="e202">This Week's Information <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>In the past week, we are very pleased to report a few things to you: ㈠ To date, we have received more than 120 letters from readers urging us to establish a reading club as soon as possible. One of them, Mr. Wu Liyuan, has put forward a detailed plan. Unfortunately, the plan is very long and cannot be copied. Now we excerpt the main points.</p>
<p>㈡ Organization process │ This department is responsible for convening this responsibility, inviting you to participate, and then the club affairs will be handled by everyone.</p>
<p>㈢ The purpose of the reading club is to study academic knowledge and to learn from each other's reading methods. Therefore, it is not appropriate to establish a very broad reading club, but it should be divided into several small organizations according to level, academic ability, interest, and subject. According to Mr. Wu's opinion, it can be divided into three types: A. Lectures on each subject. This is designed for people who do not have a foundation in a certain subject. In this meeting, there are systematic lectures, introductions to readings, and answers to reading difficulties. B. Academic topic discussion. This is established by people with higher academic ability and a considerable interest in a certain issue. This meeting selects topics, prepares discussion outlines, and then holds meetings for free research. C. Reading discussion group. This is the most free and has no fixed topic. Each meeting is a free discussion by everyone.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's method. Although this department may not be able to fully comply with it, it is considered extremely valuable, so it is conveyed to everyone. I wonder what you think, and I hope you can submit more concrete opinions.</p>
<p>㈡ Many readers came to the library in person this week to inquire about and pre-order the Reading Q&amp;A Collection; there were also fifty or sixty letters from other cities asking questions or even attaching enough postage stamps to purchase it. Now we will make a general reply to tell the people who care about it. The book is priced at thirty cents and is issued by the special distribution department of this newspaper. The proofs have now been proofread and will be published in early May. The initial sale is only 3,000 copies, and it is feared that it can only be sold in this city, so readers in other cities who need to purchase it should send a letter to the department to pre-order it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>㈢ The self-study books that readers have been urging us to publish can also be sent to print at the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Mailbox <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Dear Readers:</p>
<p>㈠ Most of the questionnaires we sent out were filled out and sent back quickly, which we are very pleased with; however, because readers are so sincere in their reading, we have even greater hopes │ we hope that all the questionnaires sent out can be completely returned. Therefore, the deadline has been extended to May 1. Dear readers, please do not disappoint us. ㈡ If your contact address changes, please notify this department immediately.</p>
<p>㈢ People who wish to participate in reading guidance, if they are in this city, must first join the library and obtain a library card.</p>
<p>To Zhou Hanzhen, Hu Kongcheng, Shen Feng, Zhang Xinsheng, and Jin Tushu: Please indicate your contact address so that we can reply by letter.</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Of course, I never reported this to the Empress Dowager later. But I knew they really couldn't get used to this kind of restraint, because such restraints were absolutely non-existent when driving any train under normal circumstances. The first uncomfortable thing was the court hat on the head and the brocade robe on the body; the second was that no matter how hard you worked, you were not allowed to sit down; and third, in order to avoid disturbing the Empress Dowager, it was absolutely forbidden to blow the whistle or ring the bell no matter what the situation was encountered.</p>
<p>How do those gatemen work?</p>
<p>Of course, they are not allowed to board these yellow carriages. They are not even allowed to run over the top of these cars! If so, at least they would be beheaded. │ Then, when this train enters a station and needs to stop, how can these people get on that yellow car and use the handbrake? This question seems difficult to solve, but in fact it is not difficult. Because the speed of this train, from beginning to end, is only fifteen miles or twenty miles per hour, │ roughly sixteen miles, so before needing to stop, the driver must first send someone to jump off the locomotive and run to the half car behind the tender, │ this vehicle is not painted yellow, but is specially for the workers on the car to rest. │ Inform the brakeman to prepare the brake car. At the same time, the driver gradually reduces the speed and predetermines where the train should stop; the train runs slower and slower, the brakeman jumps out of the car and runs to the car behind with the handbrake mechanism, or stands on the ground and waits for the car behind to run over before jumping on, and then uses the handbrake to brake the car very steadily. But in fact, the brakeman has already stepped onto the yellow carriage, which is already a violation of the Empress Dowager's order: but because they jumped up and down so quickly, the Empress Dowager did not pay attention.

<h3 id="e205">Hanshan Temple <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Yu</p>
<p>[The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky, river maples and fishing lights face sad sleep. Outside Gusu city, Hanshan Temple, the midnight bell rings to the passenger boat.] The Hanshan Temple in Suzhou, because of Zhang Ji's poem, is famous overseas and has become a famous scenic spot in Suzhou. In reality, Hanshan Temple is not enough to satisfy tourists' desires. A hall dedicated to [Hanshan and Shide], without solemn and majestic golden Buddha statues, is empty, revealing the poverty of Hanshan. The bell tower, the subject of the poem, is too small to allow room to turn around, and the dark ancient bell is said to have been replaced by the Japanese long ago, and is no longer the old object. Kang Shengren Nanhai once became very agitated about this matter and wrote a mourning seven-character poem. It said: [The bell has crossed the ocean east, the ancient temple maples in Hanshan are cold; do not let Fenggan and Raotun swallow it, so that people will never go to empty space again.] Therefore, many of my friends go with excitement and return disappointed.</p>
<p>The most lingering place in Hanshan Temple is a Wangjiang Pavilion. The rooms upstairs have bright windows and clean tables. The Wu Mountain outside the window, with its misty shadows and peaks, flies up to the building, making people reluctant to leave, forgetting both favor and disgrace! This building was built in the early years of the Republic of China by the Suzhou Governor Cheng Dequan with donated funds. Later, Cheng Dequan escaped into Buddhism, and the building also collapsed with it. Last year, the district chief Hui Xinke raised donations to rebuild it, and it has only now restored its former appearance. This is also a small vicissitude of Hanshan Temple!</p>
<h3 id="e206">Small Credit Loans <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>[Bankruptcy] and [depression] have become the common catchphrases of ordinary people. In the same city, however, banks continue to open. Banks are powerful institutions; even country folks wearing toe shoes, carrying umbrellas, and wrapped in calico can effortlessly recognize them as the wealthiest type of organization. With banks opening one after another, yet people are still clamoring about [depression] and [economic bankruptcy], it is truly bewildering.</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems utterly contradictory. But upon closer reflection, perhaps it signifies a profound crisis. Those who owe money rely on it to circulate funds and reap the benefits. But with the market being so poor, who would willingly leverage a money lender's funds to pursue uncertain ventures? So, money lenders, flush with cash but lacking demand, are turning to investment in banking as an outlet.</p>
<p>In reality, even opening a bank doesn't guarantee great prospects. Look, all the banks are emulating restaurants by selling "side dishes," engaging in "small credit loans." No, actually, it can't even be called "side dishes"; it's practically "economic set meals." A returned student, or to be more practical, a university graduate, should at least teach in a middle school even if they're utterly penniless and stuck sitting on the sidelines. But if they can't squeeze into a middle school and stoop to teaching at an elementary school, isn't that a waste of talent, and very pitiful? Banks offering "small credit loans" is the same situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must acknowledge that the common catchphrases, "depression" and "economic bankruptcy," are indeed justified.</p>

<p>Chapter 27: Secret News of a Grieving Wife, Appreciable Kindness, Old Affairs Arise After Drunkenness, Difficult to Forget</p>
<p>Two countries. To contend for survival, Country A spent a lot of military expenses to invade Country B, and Country B had no choice but to spend a lot of military expenses to resist Country A. If both sides did not spend this money and sought survival for mankind, wouldn't it be more direct and simple? Moreover, war may not necessarily solve the problem of survival. Countries that were terrible before the European War are still terrible. Even countries that can be self-sufficient are panicking after the war. The great politicians, great military experts, great scientists, and writers in the world must have insights that exceed mine many times over. Why don't they consider this point? Perhaps my level is not enough to understand what war means? Ji Zhi kept setting many questions to embarrass himself, but he couldn't answer any of them. After thinking for a long time, the alcohol rose, and he felt very thirsty, so he found a pot of boiling water in the kitchen and made a pot of strong tea. He packed up the hot pot and carried a pot of hot tea to continue his fantasy. He continued to think, if a person like me is not very satisfied with the war, how is Yang Guizhi different from other women, but she married Zhao Ziqiang, who was fighting outside the fortress? If she did it for vanity, when she wanted to marry me before, she repeatedly expressed that poverty was not a problem, and she also blamed me for only valuing the job and undervaluing love, and for not having the courage to get rid of family pressure. Looking at it this way, she definitely didn't marry him just because Zhao Ziqiang was a company commander. There may be other reasons for this. You can see that five days after their marriage, her husband went out. She can be content with her fate, which really values love. I have definitely read more books than Zhao Ziqiang, and my insights are also a step higher than Zhao Ziqiang, but I am not as good as him in winning Guizhi's favor. (369)</p>
<h3 id="e208">Yellow Wall Foot <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Hu</p>
<p>One day, while walking on the road with a Western friend, he saw the urinal on the side of the road and said with emotion: [The Chinese people's abilities are not weak, which can be seen from this yellow wall foot.]</p>
<p>This Western friend later declared to me that when he said this, he did not mean to be sarcastic, but he really said this from a real feeling. He said that with your intelligence, you will definitely be able to understand what I mean. Although I understood what he meant, I still couldn't get a word in, so I had to change the subject for the subsequent conversation. Although I have never been abroad, I don't think there is such a thing as a yellow wall foot abroad, right? Perhaps only our noble country has this kind of inferior nature.</p>
<p>On the road, I feel that my lower body is a little swollen, and I can open my crotch at any time and anywhere to relieve myself. I have to admit that this is our characteristic, and when it is convenient, there is absolutely no concept of elegance or inelegance. In general, the name is called very elegantly, called defecation and urination, so it has become a trend of being convenient everywhere.</p>
<p>Therefore, walking on the road with friends, you can be casual and convenient, and more conveniently, each person does his own thing. The upper part is talking endlessly, and the remaining drops are about to be exhausted, swaying rhythmically. Perhaps only our noble compatriots can enjoy this kind of charm?</p>
<p>What is a pity is that the situation of the yellow wall foot shows that the Chinese people are a nation beyond freedom, and the inferior nature of regarding many things as mere formalities is more important. For example, under the revelation of [No Urination], the [subconscious mind that one can relieve oneself here has become a universal psychology.]</p>

<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Roughly a few years ago, a funny incident happened in Huai'an County: An adjutant under a certain warlord went to a barber shop to get a haircut because his hair was long. It happened that this barber was thinking something odd, and carelessly shaved off the adjutant's beard. In the warlord era, soldiers were picking bones in eggs and looking for trouble even when there was nothing to do, not to mention that this was a justified and righteous reason, so naturally they would be furious. At that time, the old man in the barber shop saw that the barber had already moved the earth on the head of Tai Sui; he had stroked the tiger's whiskers; he was also panic-stricken and begged for mercy in every possible way, and also brought out people with face to mediate. In the end, only four hundred and sixty yuan were given to the adjutant, and the matter was settled. There is a joke in Yangzhou, called [one beard for five dou of rice], which calculates that this adjutant's beard, or more than one beard for five dou of rice.</p>

<p>▲Other Famous Inkstones▲</p>
<p>3. Red Silk Inkstone</p>
<p>The value of Red Silk Inkstone Red Silk Inkstone stone is produced in Qingzhou, Shandong. The Tang Dynasty record says: [Stone craftsman Su Huaiyu said, forty miles west of the state, the mountain turns upwards, more than five hundred steps, there is a cave that can barely accommodate one person. A large stone leans and hangs in front of the cave. The stone grows on both walls of the cave, blue and red above and below. There are several layers of stone in the middle, with red-yellow colors like silk. The mouth of the cave is a cliff, engraved with eight characters recording the stone quarrying in the Tang Zhonghe years. Su Gong obtained stones of four or five inches at that time, brought them back and polished them. The texture was delicate, the sound was clear, the ink rose floating, steaming and moist like dew, different from other stones. One day, the stone door of the cave collapsed and was cut off.] After that, from the Song and Yuan Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, excavations were repeatedly carried out, but no good stones were found. In the late Qing Dynasty, Prince Konoe of Japan sold treasures, including an ancient Red Silk Stone Monkey Face Inkstone obtained by envoys during the Tang Dynasty, which was sold for tens of thousands of gold. Therefore, enthusiasts of inkstones like Toyotsugu Wada were shocked by the name of Red Silk Stone and telegraphed Dr. Ogawa, a railway engineer in Qingdao, to investigate the original site of the Red Silk Stone pit. Ogawa immediately assigned many people to search in all directions, but no one knew where it was. At that time, Mr. Bando was in Qingdao and also invited more than a dozen Qingdao inkstone friends to inquire about the discovery site of Red Silk Stone. Then, according to the map, they found the original pit of the Tang Dynasty, which had been sealed and could not be mined. Moreover, the dangerous stones at the entrance of the cave overlapped, making it impossible to start. They then tried to excavate from below and obtained several pieces of Red Silk Stone, all of which were smooth and could not produce ink. Later, they learned that there was a Mo Mountain six or seven miles west of Qingzhou, about five or six hundred feet high, with a small temple on it called Red Silk Temple. Next to it was a hidden cave with the words Red Silk Cave written on the stone at the entrance of the cave. The entrance was covered by soil and stones. The workers were gathered to dig open the soil and stones, and they saw a wide field of seventy or eighty zhang. The soil inside the cave was red and damp, and all around were rocks. They were dug and tested, and they were all rough. After digging for three days and nights, only a few square feet of stone were obtained. Although they were relatively moist, they had no edges, so they were also smooth and could not produce ink. From this, it can be seen that the reason why the ancients sealed the quarry was because there were no good stones. The less stone that was produced, the more it was valued. Tang Yanyou said that Red Silk Stone has fat veins and helps ink light, calling it the best in the world. Cai Junmo said that Red Silk ink production is better than Duan. Although Dongpo said it was too much, all the scholars at that time praised it unanimously. Huang Shuyong's poem, silver hooks scattered on peach blossom paper, ivory bed grinds red silk inkstone, Wang Yanzhang's inscription, the red skin of the Taoist priest of Caxia, faintly shows veins of chaotic red silk, a thousand years of undefeated firmness and nourishment, who can bear to break its body, it can be seen that the value of Red Silk Inkstone at that time was really not lower than the green stone of Taohe.</p>

<p>Wang Mingshen, a famous middle-distance runner in China, escaped from Harbin and arrived in Ping, and then went south with the athletes from the Far East Games in North China. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, he was bedridden and unable to participate in the preliminaries. Those who knew him were deeply concerned. According to Mr. Ma John, the coach of the Chinese Far East Games track and field team, Wang has fully recovered and has been practicing on the field, hoping to recover to his original state. He will be tested tomorrow with Lin Shaozhou and Dai Shuguo under the guidance of Coach Ma, and there will be considerable results. As for Sun Che, who was admitted to the Red Cross Hospital due to lung fire, according to Ma, his condition is not as serious as generally expected. It is only a phenomenon of cold invading the lungs. After resting, it is still uncertain whether he will join the Far East Games in the future.</p>

<p>The China Academy team, the Peking basketball champion, lost to the Fudan University team, the Jiang University champion, by two points last night. The score was 37 to 35. The situation was tense and the atmosphere was warm. The Fudan basketball room was crowded with people. In the first half, Zhongyuan took the lead with a score of 20 to 1. Unexpectedly, in the second half, Fudan worked hard to counterattack, and the situation changed dramatically. Zhongyuan finally lost. Chen Zongqi and Zhang Jinxiang, the two guards of Fudan, worked especially hard and contributed greatly. Zhang Jinxiang's two long shots were the key to victory. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e217">Zhongyuan Takes the Lead <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Zhongyuan has been intense for several days and is not without fatigue. Last night, coupled with the popularity and enthusiasm, the shouts shook the house. Its failure may also have an impact. However, its rapid dribbling and skillful passing have been appreciated by all. In the first half, Zhongyuan took the lead all the way and unexpectedly failed in the second half.</p>
<p>Qiu Guangxie made the first free throw. Zhang Yucai scored consecutive shots, and Duan Zhuojin added the icing on the cake. Zhongyuan created a superior situation of eight to one. Zhao Zhenji continued to work hard, making it sixteen to five. This was Zhongyuan's golden age. Zhou Dayun scored three consecutive times at this time, gradually catching up with eleven to nineteen. Zhao Zhenji added another point, making the first half twenty to eleven.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second half, Fudan suddenly gained momentum. Zhou Dayun scored twice in the right corner, adding four points. Although Zhang and Zhao of Zhongyuan also scored two shots, Qiu Guangxie and Zhang Jinxiang added four points. Not only that, Fudan's offensive suddenly became fierce. Chen Zongqi advanced from the offensive end, which was very active. Zhongyuan was already overwhelmed. The line gradually appeared in a panic. Sure enough, Chuan Xiangrui scored, followed by Chen Zongqi. Zhang Jinxiang made two long shots, and Fudan scored eight consecutive points, taking the lead with twenty-seven to twenty-six, surpassing Zhongyuan by one point. The shouts also rose greatly.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Miserable Defeat by Two Points <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>At this critical moment, Duan Zhuo of Zhongyuan fell to the ground again with an eye abrasion. Fortunately, he recovered immediately. However, he was penalized by Fu Dan for consecutive shots. Zhongyuan fell behind by three points. Duan Zhuo did not show weakness at all, and made two shots. Zhongyuan took the lead again by two points. Unfortunately, at the end of the strong crossbow, Fudan Zhou Dayun and Chuan Xiangrui</p>
<p>scored four more goals in succession, which sentenced Zhongyuan to death. Although Zhao Zhenji worked hard to catch up, the battle ended. Zhongyuan finally lost by two points, thirty-five to thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Ordered by the Ministry of Education to be Jointly Organized by Peking University and Tsinghua University</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch) The Ministry of Education ordered Peking University and Tsinghua University, stating that after reviewing the statistics of the student examinations in secondary schools for the 21st academic year, the subjects of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology were found to be the weakest. The reason for this may be due to unsuitable teaching materials or inadequate teaching methods. Teachers must first strive to enrich and improve the content and methods of the subjects they teach in order to enhance student proficiency. This task should be undertaken by universities, utilizing all their resources to remedy the situation according to their needs. After repeated consideration, the Ministry has formulated a general outline for designated public and private universities to organize summer training programs for science teachers in secondary schools and has issued a circular for its implementation. The two universities should, to the greatest extent possible, consult and jointly organize these training programs in accordance with the provisions of the outline. They should also select experienced faculty members with expertise in secondary education from among their current professors or hire additional faculty to serve as lecturers and should submit reports on the planning and implementation of the programs to the Ministry for review.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Fujian Province Restores Local Education Fund Custody Committees in Each County <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>The local education funds of Fujian Province are managed by the Education Fund Custody Committees organized by each county. The nature of these committees is independent, and their funds are not mixed with other county funds. During the era of the 19th Route Army's administration last year, the provincial government passed a resolution to abolish the establishment of departments within the county education bureaus and reorganize the Local Property Custody Committees in each county, merging them with the Education Fund Custody Committees. Since the implementation of this policy, the county education funds have frequently been misappropriated. The current Director of Education, Zheng Zhenwen, deeply feels that educational administration and educational funding must be independent. Therefore, after proposing to the provincial government the restoration of the county education bureaus, he also proposed on the 4th of this month the restoration of the County Education Fund Custody Committee, which was passed by the meeting. The Department of Education issued a circular to all counties to promptly establish these committees. Regarding the Provincial Education Fund, the central government had suspended its allocation during the Fujian Incident. Upon resuming his position, Zheng Zhenwen strongly appealed to the central government, requesting that it continue to allocate 110,000 yuan per month from the national treasury until the consolidated tax system was reorganized, which was approved by the Ministry. Recently, due to the budget deficit in Fujian Province, the administrative expenses of various agencies were reduced to 75% of the previous year's budget, and the salaries of civil servants were discounted accordingly starting this month. However, the education sector receives full salaries without being affected by this. Moreover, salaries are paid around the 25th of each month, ensuring the stability of the lives of those in the education sector.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Promulgation of Order by the Anhui Education Department: Outline for New Life Training of Middle School Students <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Anhui Provincial Government Education Department Director Yang Lian issued an order stating: The purpose of education lies in training the body and mind of young people and cultivating healthy citizens. It is closely related to the improvement of national morality and the improvement of social customs. At present, the effect of education in our country is not obvious. The reasons are not simple. The neglect of moral education in schools is the main reason. Therefore, in recent years, the central government has repeatedly issued clear orders to rectify the atmosphere of study. The department has also repeatedly ordered schools to pay attention to cultivating students' habits of cleanliness and orderliness, and to train them in the spirit of diligence and hard work. It also held a clean-up movement competition among various educational institutions in the provincial capital to supervise the implementation of various matters. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Movement at the Nanchang camp. The main purpose is to cultivate frugality, diligence, cleanliness, hygiene, and a life in accordance with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in the "clothing, food, housing, and transportation" of the people, thereby promoting the inherent spirit of the nation, and promoting the new opportunity to revive the nation. The news has spread, and the whole country has followed suit. It is good because our country's social economy is declining, and there is no way to save it without frugality; the national situation is weak, and there is no way to recover it without diligence; the people's physical fitness is weak, and there is no way to strengthen it without cleanliness and hygiene; the people's morality is declining, and there is no way to improve it without paying attention to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. All these points are the necessary goals established to address the accumulated malpractices of the past. This kind of movement is the most necessary work to rejuvenate the country and revive the nation at present. Middle schools in this province should earnestly promote it. All school teachers and staff should take this as their goal for personal practice, and school moral education should take this as the standard for training students, so as to cultivate citizens with noble morals, sound knowledge and abilities, and become a model for society. Now, according to the main points of the New Life Movement in the Chairman's speech, the outline for the new life training of middle school students in this province is formulated and promulgated with the order. It is expected that the principals will follow the items listed, lead by example, practice diligently, supervise all the teachers and students of the school, practice hard day and night, and submit the situation of the preparation of the guiding order to the department for record within ten days after the document arrives. The department will send personnel to inspect the results at any time, distinguish the most important ones, and determine rewards and punishments. Do not violate or make mistakes. This order, the Outline for New Life Training of Middle School Students in Anhui Province.</p>

<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Fundamentally, perhaps also due to the emptiness of life, the novelists in China today generally strive for novelty and surprise in their work, whether in the subject matter, structure, sentence construction, or word choice. In my view, this is largely due to the influence of Japanese literature. Japan does not have great literature either, and this is also because its people do not have fulfilling lives. However, they are exceptionally clever, so they are flaunting their petty cleverness everywhere. The characteristics revealed in their literature are also novelty and surprise. One only needs to look at Mr. Zhou Zuoren's translation of "A Collection of Modern Japanese Short Stories" to understand this. In China, not only is literature deeply influenced by Japanese literature, but even ordinary writing has many Japanese-style elements. Originally empty content, coupled with a bit of novelty and surprise, becomes stimulating, satisfying the curiosity of those who are curious. This is like a woman whose spirit and body are completely depraved putting on a set of modern clothes.</p>
<p>The distinction between novels and essays also exists here. A novelist's observation of life is not enough to simply observe a certain special form; his eyes should see the more complete, more fundamental, and more universal aspects. Correspondingly, its expression should also be like this. An essayist is different. He often only sees an extremely small point on a whim, and then writes it out in epigrams. However, when writing, the essayist is clearly aware of his own emptiness, and also clearly confesses this to the reader. Otherwise, he would be writing a novel without measuring his own abilities. Therefore, for writers who cannot write novels but only write essays, critics, while mocking their emptiness and superficiality, should also forgive their honesty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our novelists also suffer from the emptiness of life, but what is even more painful is that they still have to write novels despite the emptiness of life. What can be done if there are no more complete, more fundamental, and more universal themes of life to write about in novels? They have to make people want to read them, so they have no choice but to make them essay-like: striving for novelty and surprise. Therefore, even if it is a very ordinary story narrated in the first person, as long as there are one or two epigrams in the middle, it becomes a novel.</p>
<p>The problem of "essayization of novels" pointed out by Mr. Mu Mutian is indeed very significant. But there is no way for "us" to "defend" against this trend. Because this is fundamentally due to the "emptiness of the writer's life," then what can "we" do except to say that the writers themselves should try their best to enrich their lives?</p>
<p>At the same time, I also hope that "essays" will not all be "easy literature." Writers with fulfilling lives can certainly write essays with the strength of a lion. To say that "prose essays" are definitely "products of the aristocratic or scholar-official class" is also a bit excessive. If the value of reportage literature is not erased by our critics, then its nature is actually very close to essays, feuilletons, and the like.</p>
<p>As for the question of a certain magazine editor mentioned by Mr. Mutian: "Recently, some things are simply indistinguishable as to whether they are novels or essays." then it is easy to solve. Those things are nothing more than two categories: one is definitely essays, and the other is neither novels nor essays.</p>

<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>After lunch, accompanied by the abbot, we all went up to the Sutra Dividing Platform on the high ground to the west. The platform is deserted and the temple is dilapidated, and it has now become a small thatched shed. Fifty steps west of the Sutra Dividing Platform, there is also a pool where Ge Hong refined elixirs, with a thatched shed on the pool and a monk practicing Taoism. When we arrived at the Sutra Dividing Platform, everyone's interest in sightseeing seemed to have been exhausted, but I, Jin Qianfu, Wu Shiji, and Xu Chengzhang became even more obsessed and determined to get to the bottom of things and climb to the very top of the Eastern Tianmu Mountain. Because the local chronicles say that the Western Tianmu Mountain is 3,500 zhang high, and the Eastern Tianmu Mountain is 3,900 zhang high. Once you are on the top of the Eastern Tianmu Mountain, you can see the shape of the mountains and rivers in half of Zhejiang Province clearly. Now that we have reached the Sutra Dividing Platform, which is eight-tenths of the way, who would be willing to give up the last bit of effort! After saying goodbye to the abbot and the other gentlemen who came with us, we only took a worker from the temple as a guide, cutting through thorns and brambles, crossing stone cliffs, and walking for two hours in the desolate grass and trees and on the muddy road before we reached the Great Immortal Peak, the summit of the Eastern Tianmu Mountain. According to the worker who accompanied us, the summit of the Immortal Peak is often covered by clouds and fog, and there are not many clear days in a year. Several years ago, the trees in the mountains were as thick as several arm spans and extended directly to the top of the mountain, so tigers, leopards, monkeys, and the like all lived there. Later, it was burned by a wildfire, and the entire mountain became scorched earth. After that, tigers and leopards disappeared, and the trees also disappeared. After hearing his words, we felt a little scared. Because after the fire, although only many withered trunks of large trees were left standing on the top of the mountain, the unburned thatch, wild bamboo, and the like had grown to a height of one person, and tigers, leopards, and the like could still hide there. After climbing over the Second Immortal Peak, the ground was full of dark water, and the grass was as wet as being by a stream. The worker said that this was the water flowing out of the Dragon Pool above, which would not dry up even in a severe drought. The higher we climbed, the thinner the air became, so everyone was panting heavily. When we arrived at the Immortal Affinity Stone, the scenery on all sides changed, and the enthusiasm of the four of us was even more exuberant.</p>
<p>This Immortal Affinity Stone is a large stone hundreds of zhang wide under the Dragon Pool on the Great Immortal Peak. There are countless strangely shaped rock walls and caves. The top of the Immortal Affinity Stone is directly under that steep cliff, which is the Dragon Pool. Although it is a small pool of clear water in the stone wall, the overflow can help form the flying foam and silver waves of the east and west waterfalls. It is not surprising that the villagers regard this as a god. Moreover, the Eastern Mountain Chronicle also records the story of people in the past encountering immortals on this stone, so later generations wrote poems comparing this stone to Liu and Ruan's Tiantai Mountain. But we neither saw dragons nor encountered immortals, only sat for a long time under an old pine tree on a rock resembling a lion on the east side of the Immortal Affinity Stone—this pine tree was really strange, it was not burned in the fire——sitting and resting under this solitary pine tree, looking up at the azure sky and the setting sun, and the surrounding valleys and cliffs, although we could not become immortals, each of our stomachs was full of feelings, a bit floaty as if we were drunk.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Mr. Zhou Zuoren's Self-Congratulatory Poem <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>- The Road from Kong Rong to Tao Yuanming</p>
<p>The publication of Mr. Zhou Zuoren's fiftieth birthday poem in the "Human World" magazine has aroused much criticism; the poem is good, and the criticism is also correct.</p>
<p>The Zhou family legend says that Mr. Zhou's previous life was an old monk: Mr. Zhou also claimed to have obtained a poem in a dream: "Resting in the meditation hall, bathing outside the meditation hall, although there are differences in movement and stillness, the mind is idle and there is no obstacle." Reincarnation as a monk, "there is definite evidence." Mr. Zhou's recent tranquil life, separated from monks by a leisure time, and compared with the ancients, is closest in state of mind to Tao Yuanming. Zhu Xi said, "Hermits are mostly people with a strong temperament and resentment," Tao Yuanming was indifferent to the outside world, but what he yearned for were figures like Tian Zita and Jing Ke. The fire in his heart, although under the cold ashes, was still burning fiercely. Mr. Zhou retreated from the front line of the New Literature Movement to talk about foxes and ghosts in the Bitter Rain Studio. Did he really become tired of the world and coldly watch? Presumably, the fierce fire is still burning under the cold ashes. Some time ago, Mr. Zhou wrote to Mr. Yu Pingbo, saying: "I also saw middle school students gave a lecture with Yu Tong, considering me as a school in literature, I disagree with this humble opinion, but this can still be said to be a matter of seeing benevolence and wisdom; only to say that I still maintain the demeanor of the May Fourth era is a big mistake. A person's attitude towards life changes all the time, how can it be maintained for thirteen or fourteen years? I examine myself and find that my thinking has become more and more decadent recently, how can I still have the impetuous and fierce energy of the May Fourth era?" From "impetuous and fierce" to "decadent thinking," in the eyes of others, it is of course like another world.</p>
<p>This path of ideological change can be called "the road from Kong Rong to Tao Yuanming."</p>
<p>Among the Jian'an literati, Kong Rong was indignant and out of step with the world. He couldn't stand what he saw, and he always loved to say it. He loved to contradict Cao Cao and scratch Cao Cao's itch, and was finally killed by Cao Cao. Those of the same generation as Kong Rong, such as Mi Heng and Yang Xiu, fell into the same fate. A little later, the Sima family came to power, and it was especially difficult to be a person: The Biography of Ruan Ji says, "During the transition between the Wei and Jin dynasties, the world was in turmoil, and few scholars were able to survive." Therefore, ordinary intellectuals had to anesthetize their souls, drink wine and take medicine to preserve their lives. Like Ruan Ji, "he did not engage in worldly affairs, and being drunk was the norm. Zhong Hui asked him about current affairs several times, wanting to convict him based on his approval or disapproval, but he always got away with it because he was drunk." However, He Yan and Ji Kang still could not escape, and even anesthetizing themselves was not allowed. Some time later, Buddhist thought became popular, and all anger was extinguished; the world-renouncing view replaced the world-affirming view, and intellectuals all became figures like Tao Yuanming. Mr. Zhou's thoughts in the May Fourth era need no further explanation. In 1926, Mr. Zhou saw the news that Sun Chuanfang had beheaded fifty students in Jiujiang, and wrote a letter to Mr. Chi Guang, saying; "Brother Chi Guang, today I saw in the English newspaper in the Yanjing University Library that Sun Chuanfang had beheaded fifty students in Jiujiang, and that ten students were sentenced to death in a certain place. I couldn't help but think of a short poem by the Greek pessimistic poet Baladas. (Original poem omitted) The poem roughly means that we are all watched and fed, like a group of pigs, to be slaughtered at will by the god of death. --However, the god of death is an alien, and people cannot do anything to him. People treating people as pigs is shocking, although there was the allusion of human swine in ancient times."</p>
<p>His anger is evident in his words. But since that time, he closed his doors to read books, and Dumb's Praise came out. Except for the Prisoner's Record in the Women's College, we no longer saw words with impetuous and fierce energy. Mr. Zhou has experienced world changes and is willing to hide his talent and preserve himself by living as a hermit. This is probably inevitable. Mr. Zhou's ideological changes in the past ten years are precisely a microcosm of the ideological changes between Kong Rong and Tao Yuanming in the two hundred years; after reading the self-congratulatory poem, we can understand it even more clearly!</p>
<p>"Postscript"</p>
<p>Mr. Yutang,</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou's self-congratulatory poem is respectfully written on Jiliu Xuan paper,</p>
<p>It is exquisitely mounted by a Suzhou mounter and hung in the Lin family's study, where we can appreciate it together. This method is the most appropriate and saves a lot of trouble. What do you think?</p>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>The beautiful image of his deceased wife was clearly reflected in his mind again. He explained to himself that this remarriage could not be regarded as forgetting her. If she could understand his difficulties, she would not be harsh on him!</p>
<p>From that day on, in the children's hearts, they often thought of that new mother. The older child had heard that her cousin's stepmother treated her very cruelly, and her cousin often shed tears in secret. Several of her classmates also had stepmothers, and they all said that their stepmothers did not treat them well, so she was very doubtful in her heart. She wondered, would Ligu treat them badly? Would Ligu be like other people's stepmothers, often scolding them, not allowing them to eat good things, and not allowing them to be happy? But Dad said that Ligu must love them very much. Then would Ligu be like her own mother, holding her sister, caressing herself, and singing soft lullabies? Sometimes her mother made very good snacks and shared them with them. Even when her mother was very angry, she never scolded or beat her. After her mother died, the child slowly forgot about her. Now Dad said that they would have a new mother, so her memory of her mother became deeper than when she had just died, and it was also the first time she felt the pain of not having a mother!</p>
<p>"Brother, when will Ligu come to be our mother!" her sister asked him once.</p>
<p>"I don't know!"</p>
<p>"Is she the same as our mother?"</p>
<p>"I don't know either!"</p>
<p>The sister glanced at her brother and ran away angrily.</p>
<p>He really wanted to ask his father when Ligu would come to be their mother; but he wanted to ask several times, but he never did, because he felt that his father was not the same father as before. His father no longer talked to him about this and that with the same childish excitement. When he was studying, his father no longer often looked at him and asked him many questions. Although his father was still so kind and happy, he did not talk as much as before, and often stared at him blankly for a while. He did not understand why his father had become like this.</p>
<p>Originally, the father had to change a bouquet of fresh flowers in front of the mother's portrait every day. The father would never let the maid do this. The father personally inserted a bouquet of fresh flowers in the vase every day, and was satisfied only when the bouquet of flowers looked good to the father. And he had also seen the father change the vase three times. The father had told him that when the mother was alive, she liked to arrange all the furniture beautifully, and often liked to change the style of the house, so the father would change it for the mother when he had a better-looking vase. But these past few days, the father no longer changed fresh flowers for the mother every day. After the first bouquet of fresh flowers withered, Aunt Lu told the father to throw them away, so he threw them away, and he never inserted them again. The father had repeatedly told them: "No matter what, you must never forget your mother!" But, hasn't Dad forgotten first? he thought. Originally, every three weeks, the father always took them to the cemetery to see the day when the mother was buried. The cemetery was not very far from home, so they went to see their mother on the one hand, and took the opportunity to take a walk on the other. Yesterday was also the day to go, but the father said that he had urgent matters and changed it to next week! This matter made the sister the most angry. She had been looking forward to this walk for a long time, but it was stopped by her father.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Finance: Gold Speculation Drives Prices Up Sharply by Twelve Yuan Six Jiao; US Bank Meeting Makes No Progress, Gold Can Be Exported <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The gold market rose sharply yesterday due to the decline in the silver market and slightly favorable news, causing large speculators to squeeze out short positions, breaking through the 80 yuan mark. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US fell uniformly, with the five metal exchange forward silver price falling by 0.5 to 0.6 li, and both exchange rate increases and decreases. London spot gold rose by 5.5 pence, US cotton fell by 3 pounds, and US wheat rose by 1.375 fen. Reports stated that the US silver meeting made little progress and that the Ministry of Finance, due to the depreciation of the US dollar (against the franc) exceeding the gold point, would allow the sale of gold. The opening price rose to 72.3 yuan, and the situation was very stable. After the opening, banks forcefully bought, pushing the internal price higher. Subsequently, a Reuters report stated that the US bank faction hoped to find a new way to overcome the President's opposition to mandatory silver legislation at the meeting with the President on Monday, and Senator Thomas, who minted silver coins, also clarified that minting silver coins was not the sole purpose of the silver faction, and we are committed to making the whole country use silver. The price once fell, but the exchange market was still tight, and the situation continued to be stable. The Guangdong merchants forcefully sold, and the noon closing price fell slightly. In the afternoon, a sudden squeeze of short positions occurred, with large speculators buying frequently. Although there was supply from Guangdong merchants and others, the amount of porridge was less than the number of monks, and the rising trend was fierce. The buying interest in the market was excited, such as Qian Changxiang, Yuan Yifu, Yongqingfa, Yong Tongfeng, Hengfu Changheng, and others. Under the short covering of speculators Lu, Wu, and Western merchant Claire, the gold price rose to more than 80 yuan. The closing price fell back into 80 yuan due to settlement prices. The swap spread was 3.5 yuan, and the pure gold price was 987 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 972.7 yuan, an increase of 5.8 yuan compared to last Saturday. The spot opening was 2.6 yuan. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4 pence for British exchange, 34.375 yuan for US exchange, and Sanbing buying US dollars for August at 75 and September at 875. China-Belgium-Youhao continued to buy US dollars for September at 8125, and the morale was greatly boosted. Dalian merchants, Yida, Yongheng Yu, Qian Changxiang, Dadecheng, and others entered the market, and the price gradually rose from 2.5 yuan. It was learned that HSBC's listed British exchange was reduced by 125 and US exchange by 25. When the price rose to 5.5 yuan, Yingfeng Heng, Hengyu, and Yifeng Yong repeatedly supplied. Maijia Lisa sold US dollars for August at 625 and July at 50 fen, and Shuntao also sold, falling to 4 yuan. Yu Qing, Yong Zhi, Feng Yong, and Dadecheng took advantage of the cheap price to buy in. Zhengjin Sanbing bought US dollars for August at 6875, returning to 5 yuan. Cuitai forcefully sold and the price fell. Yida, Yongxianghe sold again. Maijia Lisa sold US dollars for September at 8125. Duyi Sai sold US dollars for July at 5625, falling to 3.4 yuan. Yifeng Yong, Sen Changyong, Yida Yong, Hong Kangyong all bought in at low prices. Sanbing bought US dollars for September at 8125, and then rose to 5.4 yuan. Dadecheng still sold, and the price fell again to 4.2 yuan. Finally, although Fuchang and Yida Yong bought in, Ruikangsheng Da sold. The gold market rose and then fell. The noon closing was 974.1 yuan, and the spot price was 4.2 yuan. After the closing, Shengsheng Da sold heavily, and the price was 4 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 974 yuan, and the spot opening was 4.1 yuan. Hengxing immediately came to buy in. US dollars for June at 375 and August at 625 were both wanted and the price rose. Hengyu, Yiyu, Xiangfeng, Qian Changxiang, Fuyu, Qingfa Yong, Shunli Run, Chang Yufu Chang, Yuanchun, and others continued to buy, and the wind of short covering suddenly prevailed. British Bank bought US dollars for August at 50 fen, and the price rose to 9.6 yuan. Zhejiang Overseas Chinese sold US dollars for July at 375. Fuyu Yong, Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu, and others sold at high prices, falling back to 8 yuan. However, Yuanyi, Qian Changxiang, Hengxing, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuanchun Hengxingyuan, and others continued to buy in, and the price rose to 81.4 yuan. Zhaofeng Chang, Bingxing Zhifeng Yong, and others sold US dollars for July at 1875 to Citibank, falling to 06 jiao. However, morale was extremely good, and the demand in the market exceeded the supply. In addition, large speculators such as Yuanyi Dekang, Tongfeng Hengchunyuan, Yongfuyu Yong Yongfeng, and others came to buy in aggressively again, pushing the price up to 81.7 yuan. Zhifeng Yong, Yuanchun Heng Yu Renfa Yong, Dadecheng Qingfa Yong, and others sold one after another, and short sellers pressed down the price to avoid double settlement prices, so the price gradually fell to 79.2 yuan. The closing price was 979.5 yuan, and the spot price was 9.6 yuan. After the closing, Hengyu and Qingfa Yong sold, but the price remained stable. The highest price for the day was 981.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 972.5 yuan, a fluctuation of 9.2 yuan. The result was a jump of 12.6 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 33.875 yuan based on HSBC's listed US exchange rate reduced by 25, corresponding to a gold price of over 1,021 yuan. According to the closing price, the price was suppressed by about 42 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan compared to last Saturday. The registered price for May was 982 yuan, and for June was 974 yuan. The supplemental water in the morning was 982 yuan, and the supplemental water in the afternoon was 988 yuan. The pure gold price was 987 yuan. The market for pure gold was weak and tired. The gold price rose, and the market price fell slightly. Tianjin merchants sold more than 2,000 taels to Yingfeng Heng and others at a premium of 15.5 yuan. Subsequently, Hakka merchants did 300 taels at a premium of 15 yuan. The market was calm in the afternoon. Near the closing, Tianjin merchants sold more than 1,000 taels to Yingfeng Heng at a premium of slightly over 15 yuan. In the swap market, Yu Qing Yong posted to Dafeng Heng and Dadecheng Yingfeng Heng, reducing the price to 4 yuan. This was because yesterday was Sunday, and each spot number had bought a lot of spot goods, so they had to swap out cheaply on Monday. The central government continued to release 2 yuan, and then fell back to 3.5 yuan. Hengxing posted 35 contracts to Dadecheng, and Yingfeng Heng 70, and Hengyu allocated 98 contracts to Yu Qing Yong, calculated as a premium of 5 yuan. In the afternoon, Hengyu posted 70 contracts to Yingfeng Heng, still at 3.5 yuan. Later, it was about 3.78 yuan. As of today, there are still 8,953 May contracts, with a total of 9 bulls and 25 bears.</p>
<p>Trading in the market turned active. Sheng Da Heng Yu Yuanchun Yuanmao Yong Fuyu Yu Qing Yong Yingfeng Heng Cuitai Huiyuan Heng Tai Xianghe Fu Taiheng Tian Feng Xieyu Yong Hengyu and others were on the selling side. Yuanyi Qian Changxiang Yuanheng Zhifeng Yong Yixian Xie Kang Qingfa Yong Cheng Kang Yong Fu Chang Zhaofeng Chang Yuanchang Yong Renfa Yong Xiangfeng Shunli Wanxing and others were on the buying side. Yifeng Yong Dafa Yong Yida Yong Bingxing and others advanced first and then retreated. Fuyu Yong Huixiang Dadecheng Yongde Yongfeng Tongfeng Hengfu Yu exited and re-entered.

The total number of transactions on the day was 43,288 in the morning and 37,450 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>More Complex Settlements ··Excess Funds</p>
<p>Trading in the market yesterday was relatively brisk, because it was in the middle of the large settlement period at the end of April, and it was also the beginning of the week. Therefore, settlements were naturally smoother than usual. However, various types of loanable funds were in excess, so drawing funds and adding water ultimately became a futile effort. The foreign call loan market remained at five percent in both the morning and afternoon sessions, the same as the previous day, with no hope of improvement. Call loan transactions were over 5.1 million in the morning session and over 300,000 in new transactions. Transactions in the afternoon session were over 200,000. Transactions in the small association totaled over 400,000. Transactions for foreign pledges redeemed and newly made totaled over 2.3 million. Bank settlements: foreign banks settled over 2.1 million in checks, over 2.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 1.8 million in joint settlements, 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 5.8 million in various goods, foreign exchange pledges, and miscellaneous settlements. Warehousing was 1 million. Chinese banks settled over 4 million in checks, over 6.3 million in various goods, foreign exchange pledges, and miscellaneous settlements, over 1.2 million in joint settlements, over 900,000 in customs revenue, and 800,000 in withdrawals from warehouses.

<p>Yesterday, the price of small Jiangnan ingots suddenly rose by 10 yuan in the morning market to 850 yuan due to the needs of cocoon merchants, about 50,000 to 60,000 ingots. By the noon market, it suddenly stopped rising because other uses were not very extensive, and it shrank back by 5 yuan to 846 yuan. However, the result was still 5 yuan better than the previous day. The transaction volume was 22,000 ingots in the morning market and 7,500 ingots in the noon market. The price of small Guangdong ingots continued to fall.

<h3 id="e259">Securities - Bond Market Has the Appearance of a Squeeze <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>At the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange yesterday, the current month's futures were nearing the final two days. The current atmosphere was still not good. Problems such as the opening of traffic and postal services in North China have not yet been concretely resolved. The international atmosphere towards Japan is becoming increasingly serious. Foreign Minister Hirota's statements are becoming more and more arrogant. The short sellers are gaining momentum, and those longs who are unable to take delivery have no choice but to close out or roll over. The trend is forming a short squeeze, but it is still moderate. This was previously predicted by this reporter, but unexpectedly, the layoffs of the 53rd issue, which were advanced on Friday, were released, and the market price could not struggle. At the opening in the morning, the 53rd issue first sold weaving and then sold hundreds of thousands of this month's layoffs. The sound was small, and the longs were discouraged. The rear ranks were all slack and powerless, and fatigue could not be endured. The situation had become a short squeeze. Although the 4th issue had demand, it could not resist the surge of retail investors. The front ranks of the second disk rose slightly by one or two corners, while the rear ranks still did not improve and continued to weaken. At the opening in the afternoon, the near was low and the far was high, and the 35th issue also had sales, and the trend had not yet turned around. The closing became more and more chaotic, with highs and lows inconsistent, only five tenths of a corner difference. As a result, market prices, except for the recent issues of 18th Customs and Zhengliu, which were slightly better by five tenths of a corner and one corner respectively, the rest all decreased by one to five tenths of a corner. Regarding the future trend, the short sellers believe that the short covering is still needed temporarily due to the approaching delivery, so the fall will not be severe. The longs believe that there will be no major changes in the situation, and the temporary longs are being released, so there is no power to rise. Both sides have their own considerable reasons. This reporter believes that the former statement is more approximate, but it should be based on the attitude of the south. The total transaction volume was 15,826,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot and 15,825,000 yuan in futures. The results of the high, low, and ups and downs are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan) Today is the last day of this month's futures.</p>

<p>The yarn market is showing signs of stability. After a long decline, there should be a recovery trend.

<p>The cotton market is calm. Although the foreign cotton situation is softening, the exchange rate is shrinking. People's hearts are still firm and rising. However, since the current month is for delivery, there is still inventory in the docks, and buyers have not been enthusiastic. However, the long positions in the far months are still being absorbed and not released. The sales of current cotton in the market are sluggish. As far as the market is concerned, the future will not deviate from a revolving situation. (Zheng Biao rises slightly) The marked cotton opened in the morning market. The foreign cotton was flat, and the gold price rose, with the near and far months rising by one corner. In the afternoon, the market situation was still flat, and there were not many transactions in the market. There was not much fluctuation in each month.

<p>A New York dispatch on the 20th reported on the cotton market during the week, stating that the cotton market last week was triggered by the authorities' opposition to the silver legislation bill, causing long positions to close out. However, when prices fell, the supply was absorbed by the industry. In between, there was a slight recovery due to the better actual situation. There was also a wave of buying after the passage of the Peng Hai bill. However, at the weekend, due to the weakness of the wheat market and doubts about the impact of the Peng Hai bill, long positions closed out, and scattered sellers rose again. The closing out of the May contract throughout the week was absorbed by the industry. There were also rumors that the Soviet Union was purchasing cotton, estimating that about 20,000 to 25,000 bales were purchased and shipped. Recent rainy weather has delayed planting considerably. The market for major cotton goods is calm. The weekend statistics are attached below (Unit: thousands of bales)</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month turned up and stabilized. Since foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose by about three, four, and six tenths of a corner, and Ella rose by three corners and three tenths on the right, after the opening, the sentiment for near and far months seemed to turn favorable. Furthermore, because after the gradual plunge last week, the difference in the market has reached six, seven, and eight points, profit-taking accounts are thinking of covering their positions. Therefore, the buying sentiment was very strong for a while, and the price also rose step by step. Until the afternoon opening, it was initially seen as stable, but then, because customers from various gangs were quite absorbing May contracts, and short covering was still in progress, the market turned up again. However, small factories had gradually released their inventories, so the ending trend showed a slack again. As a result, this month was better by one point compared to last week, May to August was better by one point and seven tenths of a cent, and September was better by one point.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Futures Wheat Initially Up, Then Tired <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market for each month showed an initial uptrend followed by stability. Since foreign wheat quotations, both places are estimated to have recovered by three, four, and six tenths of a corner, the sentiment after the opening was expensive, and the asking price for each month was better by about two, three, and four points compared to the previous week. After entering, because buyers were not abundant, it turned to a tired trend again. Until the afternoon opening, because the selling sentiment recovered and mainland gangs slightly released their inventories, each month showed a falling image. This month, due to delivery being near, the current inventory is still flat, and the price is gradually falling and not stopping. As a result, this month fell by four points, June was unchanged, and July and August were both down by one point. It is said that the current wheat has not yet been opened because the factory appetite has not opened.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Central Customs Late Rice Slightly Raised by a Few Points <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of various gangs are similar to before, totaling about 30 boats (over 5,000 shi), and late rice is especially abundant among them, while thick粳 and various colors account for only a small number. The customer gangs' appetite on the sales market is also quite strong, and the situation seems to be improving. However, since both the North and South Ocean gangs are interested in Central Customs late rice and surplus bales, the market price cannot avoid being discounted. Therefore, even by the close, the North and South Ocean gangs, including warehouse goods, jointly took in nearly 3,000 bales. Central Customs rice was slightly raised by three or four points, while high-priced rice still showed a fixed situation. The various gangs' thick粳 rice is still difficult to trade due to continuous rainy days, and the market continues to be soft by three to five points. Du Yang pointed rice supply and demand are similar, and the supply of yin-altered yuan rice is relatively scarce, which can still keep the price tight. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 278 boats arrived from various routes downstream. The sales appetite for various goods in the market was still not bad despite the cloudy and rainy weather. However, the埠 pointed customer was slightly sluggish, and the market was set with high-quality and secondary goods of white 粳, while Central Customs goods were tired by three to five points. Sheep pointed, Du pointed, 埠 pointed, and passenger pointed were stable, without much ups and downs. Yuan's high material price was expensive, Central Customs was stable, yin yuan lacked goods and had no market, and early rice was exhausted.</p>

<p>Yesterday's passenger market situation, local customers' appetites were both strong, and although arrivals were plentiful, they were even more active. The market unanimously hoped for the best. In addition to customers from Fujian Province and Fuzhou continuing to smoothly manage, new mainland gangs arrived in the city to smoothly manage. The mainland had not had a large appetite for a long time, but yesterday it suddenly managed more than 4,000 bales. Fuzhou also took about 5,000 bales. Other local customers from Wenzhou, Ningbo, Quanzhou, and other gangs all had engagements. Daily transactions reached 12,000 bales. With the transactions being brisk, people's hearts and market prices followed suit. Each stall uniformly rose by a corner. Small twisted rice was managed by local streets for 300 bales, and the price reached 6 yuan, 8 jiao and 2 fen, also following the good by 5 fen. With the current vitality of customers from various routes, if the movement continues today and tomorrow, the market will have to gradually build up.</p>

<p>Rainy Weather Does Not Hinder Young Silkworms</p>
<p>"Chang'an" This year's farmers' hatching and breeding is not weak, but the collection of ants is insufficient. After opening and discarding, the weather is too cold, and the development is stagnant. Instructors are running around to care for them, and there is no damage. The early gangs have already started the third sleep, while the late gangs have only been open and discarded for four or five mornings. It rained the night before last, but fortunately, the young have little impact. "Farmers in the four townships of Fuyang, due to unfavorable breeding in recent years, the number of this year's silkworm ants is not smooth, only two-thirds of last year. After opening and discarding, the silkworm ants eat and discard slowly due to the cold weather, and the development is not good. The weather has been sunny and warm in recent days, and the current condition of silkworm ants is excellent. The heavy rain the day before yesterday finally stopped, and households all dried the rain-soaked silkworms, and there was no change. The early gangs have already had enough sleep for two, and the late gangs are also open and discarded for two." "Pinghu" silkworm affairs are about ten days later than Hangzhou. Farmers are now preparing for hatching and breeding. The early ones have already reached the stage of urging green and discarding, and the late gangs can also produce ants within days. The instructors are now disinfecting the silkworm houses for the farmers. "Wuxi" Instructors in the four townships of Wuxi are promoting silkworm affairs and distributing improved seeds to farmers, advising them to hatch and breed, and disinfecting the silkworm houses on behalf of them. In a few days, they can collect ants. This year's silkworm affairs in Xiyi, due to the farmers' intentions and the amount of restrictive regulations, have been reduced, and the future is difficult to be optimistic.</p>

<p>Wenzhou black tea has already started picking in recent days. The quality of this new head tea is still not bad. The opening price of rough tea is 45 yuan per dan. It seems that the cost of manufacturing and transporting it to Shanghai in the future will be heavier than in previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Local Tea Factories are Launching Weighing Operations One After Another <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Local tea factories in this port, in view of the fact that new teas from the mainland are about to be harvested, and in order to seek quick business operations, are sparing no effort in the purchase of goods. Yesterday, it was heard that tea houses such as Changji Gongsheng have all sent personnel to Sui'an, Shaoxing and other places, and the situation is quite enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Hangzhou Tea Market is Booming <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou is the concentration of shop and tea businesses. In recent days, various green teas from Zhejiang, such as Longjing, Shifeng, Maofeng, and Yuqian, have been listed sporadically. Among them, Longjing and Maofeng are in great demand due to the large appetite of Shanghai gangs, and the daily shipments are in short supply. Transactions of other various new teas are also not lonely. As for the selling prices of each tea, Longjing has opened up to 660 yuan, Maoyufeng Qian has opened a new price of 280 yuan, and Shilefeng's selling price is 320 yuan. The market is quite booming.</p>
<h3 id="e274">New Voice of She-Tun Tea Market <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>She County: Green tea from She County has always been divided into foreign firm "Rain" grade and domestic shop "Zhuang" grade. The total amount of production and sales is roughly equal. Historically, the domestic shops "Zhuang" started earlier than the foreign firms, so the tea shops opened in various ports within the country were all managed by She County people. Before the fall of the Northeastern provinces, the jasmine-scented green tea and tea dust produced in She County sold very well and business was good. Although the Northeastern provinces have been cut off in recent years, the sales markets in North China, Shandong, and Hebei have not declined significantly and can still maintain their former status. This year's new tea is about to arrive as the Grain Rain solar term approaches, and Huangshan Maofeng tea will soon be harvested. Recently, Tianjin tea firms such as Zheng Xingde and Zheng Ji have sent personnel with funds to She County to purchase tea. Shandong tea merchants have also increased compared to previous years. However, since the beginning of spring, the weather has been cold and rainy, and the tea buds have been frozen by the cold air, resulting in slow growth. The date of new tea hitting the market will be later than in previous years. As for the foreign tea firms, there has been no increase or decrease in number this year. Currently, all the firms prioritize medium- and low-grade tea leaves for export, taking a proactive approach to tea business, and the market seems to be quite lively.</p>
<p>Tunxi: As the center of the Anhui tea market, tea shops line up in one corner. In the most prosperous years, there were about eighty or ninety shops, and in the quiet years, there were still fifty or more. The rise and fall of the tea market in the producing area depends on the increase or decrease of tea shops and the expansion or contraction of purchases. Last year, due to losses from the previous two shipments, there were only about fifty tea shops in the Tunxi market. Fortunately, the cost was slightly lower, the management was cautious, and the business performance was better than in previous years. Although the profits were not abundant, few suffered losses. This year, all the original tea shops continue to open, and the number of newly organized shops has increased by more than ten. In total, there are about seventy old and new tea shops preparing to enter the market. All the tea factories in the nearby areas have been rented out. According to people in the industry, the boxed tea made in Tunxi last year has already been sold out. This year, with the convenience of transportation on the Hangzhou-Anhui Railway, they can gain an advantage in business. Even if the market changes in the future, they can adjust their sails according to the wind and avoid the danger of running aground. Therefore, the booming of Tunxi tea shops this year is based on a pre-determined plan for advance and retreat.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Tremendous Drop of Over Ten Yuan in North-South Goods and Orchid Bamboo Branches <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the sales of orchid bamboo branches have been sluggish, and the market has been depressed for a long time. The shops, seeing no hope for a turnaround in the future, have found it useless to hold on. Therefore, they have recently been selling off their stocks, with prices dropping from twenty-six or twenty-seven yuan to twenty-two or twenty-three yuan, and then to seventeen or eighteen yuan. A total of over two hundred boxes have been sold, and the price has plummeted by more than ten yuan compared to the prices earlier in the year. It is rumored that this shipment was purchased by merchants from Hangzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e276">The Dead End of Disarmament <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>Who says only Chinese people are forgetful? Aren't all people in the world forgetful? The cruel lessons of the Great War, barely twenty years ago, have already been completely forgotten by people. Isn't it so? The imperialist powers are once again frantically expanding their weapons of war, preparing for a second great massacre. In the Far East, in Central Europe, isn't every place filled with ominous clouds of war?</p>
<p>However, while they are so enthusiastically expanding their armaments, they are also sending many "gentlemen" wearing top hats and white gloves to Geneva to discuss disarmament. This is truly a remarkable feat of forgetfulness!</p>
<p>The so-called disarmament conference has been going on for more than two years, from February 1932 to the present. What has it actually accomplished? No one can answer this question. We only know that this conference spent 350 million gold pounds last year alone, which is an astonishing waste! In addition, some "memoranda" and "notes" could probably be piled up into a mountain.</p>
<p>This is not an exaggeration. Just looking at the documents exchanged by European countries regarding disarmament in March, according to Mr. Henderson, who holds the "fattest job in the world" (isn't the chairman of the disarmament conference the fattest job in the world? His salary is provided by all the countries of the world, yet he can do nothing), the gentleman who recently convened a main committee meeting in Geneva took the following from his briefcase:</p>
<p>(1) Memorandum from France to Germany on February 14</p>
<p>(2) Eden's conversations with Italy</p>
<p>(3) Memorandum from Germany to France on March 13</p>
<p>(4) Memorandum from France to England on March 19</p>
<p>(5) Memorandum from England to France on April 10</p>
<p>(6) Memorandum on disarmament from small countries on April 14</p>
<p>(7) Memorandum from Germany to England on April 16</p>
<p>However, even though the "memoranda" are as numerous as snowflakes, the imperialist powers have not improved their memory in the slightest. They are only planning how to increase the strength of their own armies. Their so-called disarmament is just a hope to disarm other countries' armies, while their own country's army should remain intact. As Berne said: "They don't even pretend to disarm, they just hope to come up with cheaper methods. In Geneva, they are just discussing with each other: 'Well, a sixteen-inch shell is much more expensive than a ten-inch shell. I'm thinking of replacing the sixteen-inch shell with a ten-inch shell to hit you, what do you think?' The success of the disarmament conference is entirely built on this kind of meaning."</p>
<p>In this way, hoping for the success of the disarmament conference is simply a pipe dream.</p>
<p>To implement disarmament, it is clear that conferences cannot succeed, nor can any "memoranda" or "notes" be effective. As Radek said well:</p>
<p>"Now there is only one kind of treaty that can still be concluded, that is, a treaty for the great powers to use to replace the League of Nations to discuss burying the disarmament conference and eliminating the difficulties for new armaments."</p>
<p>On May 30, the General Commission on Disarmament will meet again. We will hear the final death knell of disarmament at that time. ·22·</p>
<h3 id="e277">The Harm of "Obsession" <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Er</p>
<p>Some people say: Life in this world is just an obsession. True, precisely because it is an obsession, we need to uncover this obsession, because obsession is the greatest harm. Here, we can cite various obsessions in society as examples to first understand the harm of obsession, and then understand the necessity of a life dedicated to uncovering this obsession.</p>
<p>Obsession with Gods—Religion: I say it is a tool for inner cultivation. Jesus said: Repent and you will be saved. Buddha also has this kind of teaching: Good people are rewarded, and bad people are punished. The meaning of both Buddha and Jesus is to hope that people in the world will not commit crimes or do bad things. However, after years and months of storytelling, people regard Buddha and Jesus as living gods who can cure all diseases. Even religions that claim to be civilized and more advanced, such as Christianity, still have this kind of superstition. Look, when their son is seriously ill, they don't call a doctor, but kneel in front of the child's bed to pray, believing that Jesus will save their innocent child. When the son cannot live and dies, they say that it is Jesus's intention to let their son go to heaven to enjoy happiness. This clearly shows the harm of obsession. If they didn't blindly believe that Jesus could save the child's life, wouldn't it be possible for the doctor to use medicine to cure him? Therefore, if Christianity desperately spreads to uneducated people in the countryside, making them blindly believe without reason, I believe the world's population increase and decrease problem will be affected.</p>
<p>Obsession with Women—We cannot but admit that there is a group of women-obsessed people in society. They have wives—not enough, they also have concubines, starting from number zero to number eighty-six—not enough, they also have mistresses, prostitutes, and dance partners, all of whom they have to meet secretly every day; as a result, with their limited energy, they are obsessed with the realm of women. Therefore, they have no pure love for their wives, no sense of responsibility for teaching and raising children, and at the same time, their money is completely wasted. This is the second practical evidence of the harm of obsession.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also sports obsessives, reading obsessives, opera obsessives, gambling obsessives, and drinking obsessives. Most sports obsessives are school students. They only know sports and don't know how to read. In the future, after graduating from school (those who are specially allowed to graduate due to outstanding sports performance), they want to find a career in society, but even writing love letters to their lovers requires begging friends to write for them. Naturally, it is not easy for them to find a suitable position in society. All they have is a bit of strength and two long, thick, red legs. Then go be a dock worker, but they are upright scholars, who would have thought that they would end up unable to write or fight! I dare to say here that they are no different from a yellow cow, obeying the farmer's command, and can run hundreds of meters in an empty field. Reading obsessives also have bad places. Originally, reading more books is the best, but once you are obsessed, it is harmful to your health. Opera obsessives, gambling obsessives, and drinking obsessives lose both money and spirit at the same time, which are also the faults of obsession.</p>
<p>After talking about so many obsessions above, I still feel that there is one obsession that cannot be ignored. What is this obsession? It is the most fashionable obsession. I say it is the obsession with being an official. The idea of becoming an official has unknowingly invaded the minds of every young person, especially when they reach university. They are not good at studying knowledge in school. What they think about day and night is how they can become officials after leaving school. Therefore, university has become a preparation period for becoming officials, wasting good youthful years. This is indeed an obsession with being an official! But, what is so good about being an official? Naturally, this is the model given to them by the officials of our country in the past. Officials have always been rich. Not only can they have money as they wish, but they can also exercise power as they wish. Therefore, isn't being an official a pleasant thing? Who wouldn't want to be powerful too?</p>
<h3 id="e278">The Problem of Prostitution Prohibition <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>We know that the existence of prostitutes in society is not accidental, but is bred by this deformed socio-economic organization. This is something that no one can deny. Although Morgan Lewis H. Morgan believed that "the institution of prostitution is the shadow cast by the past on present family life." Or say, "The institution of prostitution is probably a remnant of ancient cross-pollination, or a symbolic memory." As for the abolition of this institution of prostitution, it is considered an important topic in social problems. In the past, in cities all over the world, passive abolition or active prohibition has been proposed, but the result has been in vain! Because the problem of prohibiting prostitution cannot be completely resolved until the socio-economic organization has undergone new changes and been established! Unexpectedly, after being frustrated by the resolution of the Sino-Japanese issue, the League of Nations vaguely proposed - and even "decided" - on a motion to "prohibit prostitution worldwide."</p>
<p>Geneva, November 11, National Electric Report:</p>
<p>"The League of Nations decided to ban all brothels in the world. ... The report on which it is based details that there are official and private prostitutes in major cities around the world. It is not difficult to prohibit this kind of improper business as long as the authorities do not issue licenses. ... Some believe that after the prohibition of prostitution, if they change their faces, it will inevitably lead to no way to investigate. However, if they can be given proper occupations after the prohibition of prostitution, they will naturally be able to become good people."</p>
<p>This "official article" looks rigorous, strong, straightforward, and reasonable on the surface, but in reality, it is just a "meaningless document"! Because the core of the problem lies in whether the authorities of each country can "give them proper occupations" so that they can "become good people"!</p>
<p>Let's see... The hurricane of the current world economic panic is raging... The commercial depression, rural bankruptcy, and the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people are at the end of this century! The authorities of each country are trying to make up for the deficit in the east and west to maintain their economic foundation, and they have no time to deal with the millions of skilled unemployed workers suffering from hunger and cold, let alone these prostitutes?</p>
<p>However, we are even more impressed by the self-destruction of prostitution after the Soviet Union completed the five-year plan in four years in a new corner of the earth - the Soviet Union, which makes us feel that "it is not difficult to prohibit as long as the authorities do not issue licenses." The emptiness of this superficial theory! Because the problem of prohibiting prostitution, according to past experiences, cannot be solved by superficial treatment; but requires thinking from the root. That is to say... If you want to eliminate prostitutes in major cities around the world, you should first investigate the reasons for the formation of the institution of prostitution since ancient times, and the conditions for the existence of prostitution under the current social system, and then you can propose a plan to prohibit prostitution.</p>
<p>Here, we deeply feel that prostitution exists with social organization and economic system, which is called "coexistence and co-prosperity"! Therefore, if you want to prohibit prostitution all over the world, you have to abandon this old socio-economic organization and create a new one. It is definitely not something that the League of Nations can do with such a "meaningless document."</p>
<h3 id="e279">Seeking Spring <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Hei</p>
<p>Spring has been in the world for a while, living in the alley of the city, not seeing red flowers and green grass, not hearing the singing of birds, after all, living here only has the feeling of hot and cold climate, and does not distinguish between spring and autumn. The pavilion room has no sun, and is isolated from nature! Although there are some landscape paintings hanging on the wall, and there is also a calligraphy scroll given to me by the painter, saying, "Vulgar guests do not come to the courtyard, the thatched door is set up but never closed; in the small window all day there is nothing to do, imitating Ni Zan and Huang Gongwang's mountains after the rain." However, only the mountain after the rain in the painting gives me a little feeling of spring. Recently, it happened to be a few days of drizzling spring rain, which was suffocating. Today, the sky is clear, so I really want to go to the countryside to see if spring has really come, so I went out after lunch. Longhua Temple's peach blossoms are originally a good way to seek spring, but when I think of the cars of famous ladies and gentlemen passing by you, even if you are unmoved and follow the etiquette, integrity, and shame of the New Life Movement, "do not look at what is impolite," you will still have a face full of dust and eat a nose full of ash on the side of the road. Therefore, I decided to go to the Jiangwan countryside to find a friend, and I shouldn't be unable to find spring in the vegetable garden and meadow there, right? I live in the south, so to get to the Jiangwan countryside, I must go north, so the road between the north and south ends is not too far. After changing trams several times, I finally arrived at the entrance of Jiangkou Park. Outside the gate, the trees by the fence were green, and the grass in the park was also green, but I didn't see a flower. I thought to myself: Spring has really come after all. But seeing a spring without flowers is enough to be melancholy! Just as I turned a corner and advanced towards Jiangwan, I saw several Japanese soldiers carrying rifles shouting and running fast, and subconsciously felt the arrival of disaster, and immediately stopped and dared not move forward. The Japanese soldiers rushed left and right, passing from the telephone pole on this side of the road to the telephone pole along the railway line, practicing street fighting. The interest in seeking spring was shattered by this scene of the tragic future drama reminiscent of the "January 28th" incident, and I had to return to the city melancholy and wandered in the tide of people and cars.</p>
<p>I have no spring in my heart, and I don't even have the fate to seek spring. I should be doing the buried work of earning a living in a cold and gloomy pavilion room. Alas.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Qing Qing <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wei</p>
<p>Today, I unintentionally received Qing Qing's letter, and I miss Qing Qing again; Qing Qing's letter is like this: Mr. Wang: How are you? Why did you have to go back in the middle of the night yesterday? After you left, who will play the harmonica for me when I perform the dance today? Mr. Wang, you look too much like my dead older brother. My older brother in the past also had a kind smile like yours; he also liked me like you; he could also play the harmonica very well. Mr. Wang, I want to call you older brother, can you promise me?</p>
<p>Older brother, I must come to the school you teach in the second half of the year to study. I really want to live with older brother often! I wish you</p>
<p>Happiness, Your newly acquainted little friend: Qing Qing</p>
<p>Qing Qing is like a flower in my consciousness; a white flower.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Qing Qing's school held a school celebration carnival; I met Qing Qing in the dressing room. As soon as I ran into the dressing room, Qing Qing jumped up from the sofa, wearing a fluttering dance suit; she embraced me, smiling so adorably, smiling. "Qing Qing, this is Mr. Wang, who I told you about!" Their principal introduced her like this. "Mr. Wang," Qing Qing called softly, leaning against me like a sheep: "Mr. Wang, you really look like my older brother."</p>
<p>"Then, you can call me older brother!" I smiled at her, stroking her soft hair. "Mr. Wang, how about playing a harmonica for me to listen to?" Her voice was soft. "Okay! I'll play while you dance?" She lowered her head and smiled, "Is "Swallows Flying Together" okay?" "Okay!"</p>
<p>So, I started playing the tune - she sang and danced... like a nightingale. At the end, she flew into my arms like a dance, and said shyly:</p>
<p>"Not dancing well! Not dancing well!"</p>
<p>I thought to myself, "Gentle little girl!" She told me many things about her school, and also told me about the program she performed today.</p>
<p>The stage opened - whenever she danced, I always played the music for her.</p>
<p>When the show ended, the night was already so deep; I wanted to go back, but Qing Qing dragged me, begging me. "Mr. Wang! Don't go back! Teach at our school!"</p>
<p>"Qing Qing, this is not possible; if you miss me, I will come to see you often in the future!" I held her hand.</p>
<p>She looked at my face disappointedly, as if she was about to cry.</p>
<p>I picked her up and whispered in her ear...</p>
<p>"Qing Qing, don't be sad, your older brother must go tonight." After I put Qing Qing down, I left hastily.</p>
<p>Today, I unintentionally received Qing Qing's letter, and I miss Qing Qing again.</p>
<p>Qing Qing is like a flower in my mind, a white flower.</p>

<p>— Mai Fu</p>
<p>One of the most embarrassing things on weekdays is when people ask about "age".</p>
<p>Although I have never lied, and there is no need to make my age younger, I always have to say one or two years older. However, the listeners never believe it. Judging from the questioning expression, they always think that my answer is incorrect. Sometimes people even praise me like this... "Such a young child!" This makes me feel unusually embarrassed, because I know that although I am young, my appearance is indeed a bit old. The wrinkles on my forehead and the paleness of my face have clearly marked my position in life. Those who praise me as a young child are undoubtedly mocking me.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I am only twenty-three years old this year, but I look like a middle-aged man in his thirties. I don't care about this. It's okay to be old. Life always gets old. What does it matter! However, my age is indeed young, but I am so severely aging, which is still sad!</p>
<p>Why am I so old? I can only scold my environment. At sixteen, I was sick at home for the whole year, but it was not serious, because I was too old. Most families didn't even have food to eat, so my father was very neglectful of my illness. He hired a doctor to see me once or twice, but it didn't get better, so he stopped. This dragged on, so eating medicine was rarely effective. In the end, my mother specially ran around and raised a larger amount of medical expenses to take medicine non-stop to eliminate the illness. However, at this time, my body has suffered a great blow. I was only seventeen years old, but I looked like someone in their twenties. I vaguely remember that in the spring of 1927, a cousin got married, and I went to make trouble in the bridal chamber. Probably because I made too much trouble, the bride pleaded like this... "Please let this old man rest for a while!" This made me very angry. I was only seventeen years old, and she said I was an old man, so I made even more unruly trouble until she knelt down and worshipped. However, at that time, there was infinite sadness in my heart, because youth was indeed saying goodbye to me, although I had not really become an old man.</p>
<p>In the past few years, I have been living in Shanghai, and the life I have lived makes me dare not recall it. Sometimes I am full of poverty, and sometimes I have suffered enough insults from the dogs. The worst thing is that I worked as a slave under Mr. X for the whole year in 1920, and last year I didn't breathe air for the whole year. I have also suffered several mild or severe illnesses.</p>
<p>These are the roots of ruining my youth. Under this kind of torture, I had long planned that I didn't want my youth, and in fact it couldn't stay.</p>
<p>However, although the appearance is a bit old, the mood is fortunately still youthful. This, I can guarantee with confidence.</p>
<p>As long as my heart is indeed youthful, I also feel that I am still a salvageable person. Yes, the dangerous environment, the dangerous society, I must give it a worthy reward.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Random Thoughts <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ying</p>
<p>Quiet in the window, the sun is fading, the incense in the incense burner is gone, but the fire is still warm; leaning lazily on the embroidered bed, deeply closing the door, eyes blurry, half-open, half-dozing.</p>
<p>Tired of listening to the wild sparrows chirping on the carved eaves, afraid of seeing the willow catkins flutter on the embroidered curtains; picking up the embroidery needle and turning it upside down, the two tips pointing, half-relaxed, half-gathered. - Zha Deqing - Occasionally I flipped through a collection of Yuan Dynasty songs, and these two are my favorites and I can't bear to let go. I silently recited them several times, and a little spring heart couldn't help but feel a great surge. It's as if an ancient war is a desperate war for weak nations.</p>
<h3 id="e283">The Tramp Child - Produced by Chen Jingsheng <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>War is terrifying, but surrender is by no means a spring-dreaming beauty, emerging gracefully from the book, "Smiling, leaning on the jade youth, wanting to sleep," I immediately regard myself as the powdered youth.</p>
<p>Imagination cannot but allow me to trace back to centuries ago. The mystery of the relationship between men and women is truly thought-provoking. In the secluded boudoir, a maiden harboring spring desires is locked away, her heart full of spring feelings with nowhere to express them, and she has no choice but to entrust them to the surrounding scenery. The blooming and falling of flowers touch her heart with joy and sorrow; the waxing and waning of the moon evoke endless longing. Wisps of incense and the murmuring of swallows are enough to make her feel envy, jealousy, and resentment. At this time, everything feels unnatural... Sitting is not right, standing is not good, just soft and languid, an indescribable emotion that even the most skilled artist cannot capture even a fraction of. "Since the flowers</p>
<p>three four, rambling on, half true, half frivolous." A poem that truly captures this feeling.</p>
<p>Even if there is a matter of secret love, it is always done stealthily, the so-called "moon on the willow tip, a rendezvous after dusk" is enough to exquisitely portray the essence of a tryst. As for "Wearing spring clouds, loosening jade hairpins, eyebrows faint like autumn mountains in a mirror, is the crabapple in bloom? Is the powdered youth coming?" this poem can even make me think of a mysterious circle of a maiden in a deep boudoir longing for spring.</p>
<p>"A jade beauty leans lazily against the east wind in the spring slumber" is, after all, real, as for things like "The spring scenery cannot be contained in the garden, a branch of red apricot extends over the wall," how much of that can there really be? In this regard, I have always preferred mystery. If humanity reaches the point of unrestrained freedom like cats calling for spring, what meaning is there left? However, the giant wheel of the times eventually carries humanity down this path. Clothes can be discarded, and naked you face me, and I face you, calling it "returning to nature." I don't believe why no one advocates eating raw meat and drinking blood, wouldn't that be even closer to "nature"?</p>
<p>Things like this really frighten me. I remember once seeing these words in a tabloid: "If women don't wear pants, men will inevitably lose their jobs." Well, now that women haven't taken off their pants yet, the angry tide of unemployment is already raging like hell. If it really comes to an era when every woman doesn't wear pants, then all the men in the world will surely die clean, but perhaps the world will be at peace then.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the times haven't reached that point yet. Women still wear pants, and men still wear gowns. However, the mysterious relationship between men and women has long disappeared, and what follows is the temptation of flesh. Let's not talk about those "overflowing with fleshy fragrance" and "soul-stirring carnal sensations," but just look at what we see every day, and you will surely believe that I am not mistaken. Don't you see the "agitated X breasts" almost jumping out of the cheongsam, the "swaying X parts" thoroughly arousing the heartstrings, as for those "graceful figures," "slightly exposed jade legs," "blood-red lips," "dark eyelids"... and so on, are just trivial matters.</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times keeps turning forward, and it cannot be denied that everything is progressing. The mystery between men and women no longer exists, and the status of women has also been raised. Discussions about women's issues are truly the most fashionable thing, especially the debate on women's employment issues, which was heated up once not long ago. Now it's a little quieter, but it doesn't mean the problem has been resolved, it's just that everyone is tired and sits down to take a sip of tea and rest. Although I am a person who prefers mystery, in this era, there is no room for such quirks, but the temptation of flesh is really too excessive, so much so that I am a little frightened. Therefore, I want to advise my fellow women, don't focus solely on rouge and powder, especially those ladies who write about women's issues, before writing articles, be sure not to forget to wipe off the greasepaint on your faces first.</p>

<p>"You are really useless!" Seeing Lian Sun and Gui Sun standing there trembling, knowing that it was also wrong, he shouted, "Pu Ning, pull!" Pu Ning helped Madam up to lean on the chair, while listening to Master's command, he couldn't help but pull the cloth strip. Sixth Master shouted again, "Use force!" and Pu Ning used force. When Madam woke up, she only</p>
<p>saw her son, his eyes bulging out, his tongue hanging out, she was so startled that she cried out and fainted. Sixth Master tested the corpse, it was completely lifeless. He let it fall to the ground, and hurriedly helped Madam, shouting, "Pu Ning, help Madam back." Turning back, he instructed his two good nephews, "Let's go everyone." Lian Sun and Gui Sun each got a revolver hidden away, and followed Sixth Master out of the new house. Sixth Master didn't notice. As soon as Madam entered her own house, she looked up and saw that her son's corpse seemed to be hanging by the bed, she cried out again and fainted. Young Madam came to serve Madam, but she didn't know what was going on. Madam woke up and hugged Young Madam, crying loudly, frantically shouting,</p>
<p>"He, he, followed me into the room!"</p>
<p>"Who, Mother?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you see? He's standing next to you!"</p>
<p>"No one is standing next to me, Mother."</p>
<p>"He's asking for my life, I'll go find his grandfather!"</p>
<p>Madam shouted and was about to get up. Young Madam heard that what she said was wrong, and pressed her down with force. The maid brought ginseng water in to help Young Madam press down on Madam, while comforting Madam to sleep. Madam didn't have much strength either, she drank the ginseng water and slowly fell asleep. Young Madam softly asked the maid,</p>
<p>"Why is Madam like this?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>From then on, Madam became insane, often shouting,</p>
<p>"He's asking for my life, I'll go find his grandfather!"</p>

<h3 id="e285">A Glimpse of Ancient Chinese Bridge Architecture (Part 2) <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>(2) Arch Bridges—also known as ring-hole bridges, are a unique style of bridge in China. From an aesthetic point of view, they are extremely beautiful, and from an engineering point of view, they are extremely strong, with a style and structure that reaches perfection. The construction of this type of arch bridge does not use mortar, but is made by stacking stones. The ring-hole is the skeleton of the entire bridge, with low walls on both sides. The space between the two walls is filled with silt and broken bricks, and stone slabs are laid on top, forming steps, which can then become a bridge. Usually, the bridge foundation of an arch bridge is also made of stone blocks or stone strips. The bottom layer must also be densely driven with wooden piles, and stone blocks are densely laid on top of the wooden piles. This is the bridge pier. The bridge pier must be at least one foot above the highest tide level to ensure the safety of the bridge. The stones used to build the low walls must be neat and strong to prevent water leakage. The laying method is the same as laying bricks, with parallel and smooth laying. A stone strip must be laid on the top layer of the wall, with a length that is half the bridge, or two or three strips can be joined together. If the stones used to build the wall are large granite stones, mortar may not be needed. Otherwise, stone seams can be slightly embedded to strengthen and prevent water. After the walls are filled with silt, broken stones, etc., the bridge deck can be laid and stacked into steps. Also, when the low walls are stacked, stone pillars can be erected on both sides near the ring-hole, and a stone strip can be laid across the top of the two opposite pillars to hook and secure them, so as not to deviate. This type of low wall has the function of resisting external forces. The stones of the ring-hole are loosely connected, and when the bridge foundation sinks or is squeezed, they can easily fall off and cause disaster. This type of low wall can prevent problems. However, the low wall cannot resist external bending forces, so the ring-hole must be arched upwards to squeeze against each other. Furthermore, this type of ring-hole is mostly a large arc shape, meaning that the center of the circle is higher than the bridge pier, so the shear force on the two walls is extremely small, making it a very reasonable construction. Sometimes this type of arch bridge experiences tilting due to damage to the bridge foundation and bridge piers. However, if the low walls and ring-hole have not collapsed, they can still be redesigned and remain convenient for traffic, without any drawbacks. This phenomenon can be seen in arch bridges everywhere, which is truly remarkable. The distance between the arch top and the bridge deck has no fixed rule. However, from observation, the larger ones are about one-sixtieth of the span of the arch, and the smaller ones must be within one-thirtieth of the total span, otherwise they will easily be damaged.</p>
<p>(3) Cantilever Bridges—In western and southwestern China, there are very few stone strip bridges, but many cantilever bridges. They are usually built in places where the required bridge span is wide. If the span of the bridge opening is greater than 130 feet, then this type of bridge is necessary. Therefore, wide rivers often use this type of cantilever bridge. The method of construction is to first drive piles and build foundations on both banks, and then use long, large pieces of wood to insert into the foundation, horizontally and diagonally extending outwards, like an arm stretching out. Several layers are extended in this way, and when the distance between the two ends of the top layer is not far, the bridge deck can be laid. This type of bridge deck should be easy to replace, which can save a lot of damage and repair costs. At the joints of the bridge deck on both ends of the cantilever bridge, plywood is used, otherwise it may not be able to bear the weight or there may be danger. The bridge opening of this type of cantilever bridge can also be increased. Simply build another bridge foundation in the river and extend it from both sides, and it can be used.</p>
<p>(4) Suspension Bridges—Suspension bridges are also a unique product of the country's architecture. The raw materials are bamboo bridges and hemp ropes, and their strength and durability are also quite remarkable. They are most often used in places where the river surface is wide and the mountain roads are rugged. They are very easy to see in Sichuan and Yunnan. The method of construction is to erect high frames on both sides of the river or valley and bind them with bamboo ropes. Large baskets are tied on the ropes, which can accommodate about two people, and another thin rope is used to pull them across the river or valley. There is also a simpler method. A high frame is erected on the river bank, and a bamboo rope is tied to it, and this bamboo rope is tied securely to a stone cave at a lower point on the opposite bank. In this way, sliding up and down without pulling the rope can also be used for ferrying; and at the same time, it is installed in reverse in the same way, so it is convenient for both coming and going. Sometimes two parallel bamboo ropes are used to cross a river, with a height difference of five or six feet being appropriate. People can step on the lower rope and hold on to the upper rope with their hands. This is also one type of suspension bridge. Most suspension bridges have one bridge opening. At both ends of the bridge opening, there are station houses, with two pillars in the middle to tie the two ropes, and each is equipped with a windlass to tighten the bamboo ropes, so as not to make them slack. The span of the bridge opening is limited to a maximum of 250 feet. However, there is a suspension bridge on the Min River in Guangxi, which is 700 feet long and 9 feet wide. It is built with ten bamboo ropes with a diameter of 6.5 inches. The structure is divided into six bridge openings, the largest of which spans about 200 feet, and the rest are of varying sizes. There are also as many as five guide ropes. The supports at the most load-bearing parts are made of granite, and the rest are made of wood. The bridge deck is made of ordinary wooden boards, which is extremely safe to walk on, and bamboo pillars and wooden nails are used to strengthen the structure of the bridge body and bridge deck. In addition, metal materials can be said to be absolutely unused, and every year the wooden boards on the bridge deck must be selected and replaced like railway sleepers to avoid danger. The bamboo ropes must also be checked frequently to ensure the safety of travelers. The tensile strength of this type of bamboo suspension bridge is about 26,000 pounds per square inch, so it is extremely load-bearing. Its origin is said to be in Tibet, because even today, this type of bridge is most often built in Tibet.</p>
<p>In addition to bamboo, suspension bridges can also be made of iron chains. However, this only appeared after the 15th century and is an advancement of bamboo bridges. The method is still the same as described above and does not need to be described separately.</p>
<p>In summary, China's achievements in bridge construction can be seen from the above, and the popularity of bridges is even more astonishing. There are currently no statistics on the total number of bridges in the country. However, according to Marco Polo's records when he visited Hangzhou, there were more than 1,200 bridges of all sizes in Hangzhou at that time (13th century). Therefore, including all 30 provinces and urban areas in the country, there should be no fewer than 5 million bridges.</p>
<h3 id="e286">A Humble Suggestion for the Construction of Common Public Buildings <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>The construction of public buildings (or simply apartments) has been extremely developed in Shanghai in recent years. The tall buildings of seven or eight stories, soaring into the clouds, can be said to be solemn and magnificent, economical and practical. In Shanghai, where land is worth its weight in gold, this is indeed worthy of our attention and study. However, the current construction of such apartments mostly tends to be luxurious, with too much emphasis on decoration. It seems that the purpose is not at all to pay attention to the housing problems of ordinary city residents, but rather to compete and strive for height, which inevitably violates the principle. Therefore, the construction cost is very large. Instead of seeking innovation and research in materials, the focus is on magnificent appearance, so those who enter and exit are bound to be big bosses of foreign firms and managers of companies. The monthly rent is hundreds of dollars. They drive their own cars every day, leisurely and comfortably. This kind of good fortune can only be enjoyed by the rich, and even more often by foreigners. Very few Chinese people can enjoy it. Can we say that this phenomenon is the development of social economy and the trend of new life for the people? No, this is just a kind of equipment for the enjoyment of the rich. It is of no benefit to ordinary residents. Then why can't we use this good construction method, apply the progress of modern civilization, to make the housing of our general residents get safe and comfortable new equipment? To make the benefits of construction reach the general residents, the only way is to make it popular. This is not to say simple or sloppy, but just to think of ways to reduce the cost of construction, so the rent can be suitable for the living standards of ordinary residents.</p>
<p>(2) Benefits of Apartments</p>
<p>The construction of apartments is very developed in foreign countries, but in China, it has only gradually risen in recent years. The trend has a vigorous atmosphere. However, the disadvantage is that it cannot be popular and cannot fully express its benefits. As for our current residential buildings, they are specially equipped for one family to live in. They take up space, cost a lot of money, and are very uneconomical. Like in the alleys, several families have to live in one house, which is as narrow as a pigeon coop. Simplicity and sloppiness need not be said. No attention is paid to hygiene, nor is cleanliness sought. The avoidance of fire is not considered at all. Promote the general industry and commerce of architecture</p>
<p>(3) Construction of Apartments</p>
<p>The construction of popular apartments cannot be sloppy, and the equipment cannot be simplified, but magnificence is not necessary, and decoration is not necessary. I think that popular apartments should have the following conditions, which are:</p>
<p>(1) Safety, such as the firmness of the building and the avoidance of fire;</p>
<p>(2) Cleanliness, because neatness is beauty, and cleanliness can prevent epidemics;</p>
<p>(3) Comfort, living must be comfortable, but not luxury, because luxury is too uneconomical, and it is not necessarily comfortable; (4) Grandeur, grandeur is not in the emphasis on decoration, but the overall appearance of the building, majestic and grand.</p>
<p>These four conditions of safety, cleanliness, comfort, and grandeur should not only be paid attention to when building apartments, but also all buildings cannot be separated from these conditions. However, the construction of apartments has a great limitation, that is, the construction cost should be saved as much as possible. Then, for this kind of building, we must not follow the old habits, and we must conduct a lot of research and consideration on the materials. The construction of wood is not durable, which is a great disadvantage, and it is easy to cause fire. The construction of steel is not cheap at present. If we can use steel units to build houses in the future, then the materials can be produced in large quantities, and the price will naturally be much cheaper. There is also a method of constructing concrete, which is relatively suitable and uses various concrete building units. It is both strong and cheap to build. This construction method is very worthy of our research. As for the construction method, it is originally changing with each passing day. Of course, there is no need to stick to one method, nor is it necessary to copy other people's inventions. We must strive for improvement and surpass others. This is what architects and engineers should strive for. What we have at hand now are scientific theories and mechanical inventions. If we want to research, if we want to experiment, if we want to create, what is so difficult about this!</p>
<p>The various equipment in the apartment should be as scientific as possible, and the interests of the public should be taken into account, such as the heating equipment of the house, the ventilation equipment, the adjustment of air, the installation of windows, and even the supply of electricity and tap water, etc., should all strive for new styles, reduce costs, and enable residents to enjoy great benefits, while only bearing limited and light expenses. How can we achieve this level? Only by applying science as much as possible, and when it comes to the issue of management, that is also very important. Otherwise, even if there is good equipment, it cannot be guaranteed for a long time. If there is a machine with high efficiency, it cannot be used well. Isn't it a pity? Inefficiency is a natural result, which is to make residents bear more burden on the apartment. The principle is not in line.</p>
<p>Special attention should be paid to the prevention of diseases in the apartment, because there are many residents in the apartment, and it is very easy to spread. Therefore, cleanliness is extremely important. The introduction of sunlight and the circulation of air are especially important in places with many people. It is best to have open spaces around the apartment, plant trees, so that children can play, and adults can rest, which is beneficial to hygiene and beauty.</p>
<p>(4) Apartments and the Prosperity of the City</p>
<p>Shanghai can be considered prosperous. The population is more than 3 million. The development of commerce is the first in the country and world-renowned. Everything is inferior to that of other parts of the country. Therefore, those who are responsible for public security feel that their duties are very important. Not only must they maintain the current prosperity of Shanghai, but they must also plan for new developments in the future. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the first to discover the shortcomings of Shanghai's business circle. Therefore, we now have the plan for this Greater Shanghai. However, the more developed a city is, the more people there will be, and the problem of accommodation becomes a very important problem. Therefore, I think the construction of apartments is very worthy of research. If we say that all the residences in Shanghai are apartment-style, then the population can definitely be increased by ten times, twenty times, or even dozens of times on the same foundation. In total, it is not difficult for the population of Shanghai to increase to 10 million. As the population increases, commerce will become more and more developed, and the prosperity of the city will be rising steadily. Who can predict the bright future with numbers?

<h3 id="e287">New Buildings Recently Approved by the Public Works Department <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoyan</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession has decided to issue a large number of building licenses this week. Real estate and building operators are now focusing their efforts on the construction of Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, Meibake Road, and the Suzhou River area. The following sections are sufficient to benefit the construction industry.</p>
<p>(1) The Public Works Department has approved the construction of 182 Chinese-style houses and 70 Western-style shops in the area surrounding Meibake Road, Qingdao Road, and Pike Road. (See picture) What is even more noteworthy in this area is the demolition of the water and fire company at the west end of Xizang Road. Also, many houses at the corner of Meibake Road and Bake Road will also be demolished.</p>
<p>(2) The construction of department stores: the extremely large Daxin Company to be built near the corner of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road. The houses in the area near the corner of Xizang Road and Beijing Road will also be demolished to expand the road.</p>
<p>(3) 36 Chinese-style houses and 12 shops will be built on He De Road. The location is between Wuding Road and Kangnao Tuo Road.</p>
<p>(4) The Public Works Department has allowed the construction of 30 Chinese-style houses and 5 shops near Mabai Road and Xiaosadu Road.</p>
<p>(5) A general meeting house and bleachers will be built at the intersection of Singapore Road and Haifang Road.</p>
<p>(6) 10 Chinese-style houses will also be built at the intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Xiaosadu Road.</p>
<p>(7) The construction on Fujian Road includes two Western-style shops and seven Chinese-style shops. The location is between Beijing Road and Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>(8) The building that was formerly the Mailington Advertising Company (on Aiduo Ya Road, between Jiangxi Road and Henan Road) will also be demolished to build a new house.</p>
<p>(9) There are already two factories to be built in the eastern district. One is a large factory and warehouse on Longkou Road. The second is a glass factory and its staff residences. This factory will be located near Pingliang Road and Lan Road.</p>
<p>(10) A factory will also be built on the south side of Dong Han Bi Li Road, near Zhou Jia Zui Road.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Domestic Stone Materials Suitable for Construction <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Dawei</p>
<p>During my spring break, I traveled to Beijing. After enjoying the famous scenic spots, I traveled all over the city streets. The public works and hygiene are cleaner than before, but the commercial progress seems to be slow. Although the buildings, such as railway transportation departments, are beautified by combining Chinese and Western styles, they do not lose the inherent essence of the East, but this is not surprising. What is most noteworthy is the facade of the Juxingcheng Bank in Xinjiekou. Observing the stone materials, the black ones are like granite and strong, and the green ones are like marble and solid. They are bright enough to be used as mirrors, and they shine with the sunlight. Those who pass by stop and watch, sighing that they are rare. I was also curious and wanted to find out which country produced them. I have heard that the black stone of this benefit and the green flower stone of Italy have long been famous in the world, and they seem to be close to them. I dare not despise domestic products, but I have never thought that China could have such great achievements. Later, I was told by the craftsmen that they were indeed pure Chinese stone materials, produced near Laoshan Mountain in Qingdao, and constructed by the Chinese Stone Company. I asked where the Chinese Stone Company was located, and why had I never heard of it. The craftsman replied that it was in Qingdao, and that there was also a branch in Shanghai. I was very happy to hear this, and lingered to watch and study again. It is a pity that they were used sparingly. If large buildings were used, wouldn't it be magnificent? After returning to Shanghai, I went to the company at No. 33 Sichuan Road to visit. There were many kinds of stones, colorful and beautiful. I learned that the black stone was called feldspar, and the green flower was called jade Buddha stone. Compared with the quality of black and Italian green, they are not as good. China has hidden rare goods for a long time, and it does not know how to use them. Instead, it relies on foreigners. Stones are like this, let alone other things? The company that created this initiative is also great. I hope that it will move forward bravely and take the lead in the world of stone materials. This is a matter of course. As the saying goes, "Although the peony is good, it needs green leaves to support it." It also depends on the architects to use it more, so that domestic products can be promoted and foreign goods can be prevented in case. This is a great pleasure during my trip to Nanjing. I write it down and want to introduce it to all walks of life.</p>
