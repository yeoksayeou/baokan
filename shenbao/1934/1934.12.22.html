<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀英國實業調查團報告書感言</h3>
<p>日昨外電。英美日三國海軍軍縮會議。已正式宣告休會。則此後將趨重於會外接洽矣。世人所注重之遠東問題。除日美關係之發展而外。日英關係之如何推移。尤將爲太平洋外交局勢决定之因素。英之地位。足以舉足而重輕。不待言也。我人觀於昨日英國實業恊會所發表關於「满洲」調查之報告書。而不能無所感焉。</p>
<p>夫遠東各國勢力之均衡。自經日本九一八佔取我國東北四省以來。加以一九三四年四一七「他國不能染指」之宣言。已經打破。不能不引起英美各國驚懼。而美之對日態度。尤爲顯著。迄今美代表台維斯尙不忘情於九國公約之維持。（國民二十日倫敦電）共不甘完全放棄遠東之雄心。固已顯然可見矣。英國則介乎兩天之間。處境較爲困難。對於台維斯之主張。固未嘗不表示同情。而對於日本。則不能不有所聯絡。我人觀於前此李頓報告書。已足以窺見英人之意嚮。此次英國考察團出發時之宣言。與回國後之報告。又一再聲明其爲非官塲與非政治性質之舉動。而僅認爲促進倫敦東京間成立永久之連鎖。鞏固友好之精神。其苦心槪可想見。然英傳統之外交手段。固亦如是也。</p>
<p>說者謂英調查團遠涉重洋。無非藉商業談判之名。以謀政治上之妥恊。爲外交戰略之一種姿勢。眞相果否如是。吾人初不欲加以推測。但以此次報告之内容大意而觀。念念以合作發展「滿洲國」爲英日關係增進之基本精神。不以日本所行之政策爲誤謬。雖於日本近年來在「滿蒙」之活動。無所論列。然其對日之表示同情。則可以窺見一斑者也。惟我人對於此次英國考查團之赴「滿。」有一可疑之點焉。以英國對「滿」貿易關係言之。一九三三年。各國在「滿」貿易地位。以日本爲第一位。德美次之。而「滿」之對英輸出。爲九百萬「滿元。」由英輸入。則只有七百餘萬「滿」之對英。顯居出超地位。且自「滿」宣布煤油専賣以來。最近又有進口關稅之修訂。「滿洲」市塲前途之發展。由列强方面論。除日本以外。俱成每况愈下之勢。殊不足構成英國海外市塲之重心。今觀其報告書。雖引爲開拓之良機。認爲合作原則之保證。與夫鋼鐵恊定成立之有望。然其收穫。必不能豐假使該辭勞瘁。遠游考察。而所得僅僅如是。豈英人最善之策乎。竊謂以英人之智。其所懷抱。必不僅此而止也。</p>

<h3>蘇省改革納糧制度</h3>
<p>先從土地陳報完畢縣份着手</p>
<p>由各地銀行設立收稅處代辦</p>
<p>鎭江通訊、蘇財廳鑒於過去本省各縣田賦納稅收欵事項、均由縣府糧櫃辦理、其弊端不勝枚舉、雖一經發覺、嚴厲懲辦、然終不能澈底肅清、茲爲改革起見、擬將田賦納糧稅收、交由各該地銀行辦理、銀錢收入、由銀行在當地縣政府設立收稅處、與糧戶直接辦理、先從土地陳報完畢縣份着手、據財廳方面消息、現施行斯項制度者、已有吳縣·常熟·崑山·嘉定·宜興·吳江·等七縣辦理成效均佳、至鎭江方面、將於明年一月實行、斯實爲最近稅政之一大改革、茲將納稅辦法探誌於後、</p>

<h3>山東珍品靑州桃萊陽梨</h3>
<p>烟臺菓品洋馳名中外</p>
<p>魯建廳調查產銷情形</p>
<p>濟南通信、山東土產豐富、除重要土產棉麥花生以外、有名果品、亦隨處皆是、肥城桃·樂陵棗·曹州石榴·靑州蜜桃·萊陽梨等等、莫不名馳冀北、味壓江南、建設廳前曾派員調查各種菓品產銷情形、及其病害、以便預防、現在關於魯東方面之靑州蜜桃·萊陽梨·烟臺果品等、調查報告、業已脫稿、茲將就中關於產量運銷部分、摘錄如左、</p>
<h3>萊陽梨</h3>
<p>（一）產地及面積、萊陽梨之裁培區域、僅限於蜆河東岸·及漳河南岸之沙地、蜆河東岸植梨各村、如吳格莊·紅土崖·鹽兒港·照旺莊·葉家泊等、南起五龍村、北迄石朋·長約一十里、漳河南岸植梨各村、有郮格莊·鹿格莊·蘆兒口·大陶漳·西陶漳·自南務迄肅格莊、長約二十五里、該區爲產梨最盛區域、所有兩處梨園、土質純爲石英沙灘、沙層愈深、梨之品質愈佳、故在蘆兒港·照旺莊·葉家泊·本村之沙層深厚地方、所產之梨、自昔即爲貴重果品、現在東西各國人士之購求爭先恐後、而附近嗜食人士、年來亦不惜鉅金購買、所以萊陽梨之聲譽、在魯東一帶、較諸魯西之肥桃、有過之無不及焉、茲將調查園較多各村、約計其面積株數如下、蘆兒口二○○畝、三·○○○株、大陶漳三○○畝、四·五○○株、吳格莊四○○畝、六·○○○株辛格莊三○○畝、四·五○○株、　格莊二五○畝、三·七五○株、蘆兒港九○○畝、一三·五○○株、照旺莊七○○畝、一○·五○○株、葉家泊三○○畝、四·五○○株、南務五○畝、七五株、周格莊二○○畝、三·○○○株、西陶漳二○○畝、三·○○○株、其他各村二五○畝、三七五株、合計四·○五○畝、六○·七五○株、</p>
<p>（二）種類及品質、萊陽梨約有十數種、如荏梨·香水梨·秋白梨·洋梨·馬蹄黃梨·酸窩梨·甜窩梨·秃頭梨·即墨梨·拉打秋梨·白　梨·等種、但其種類名稱、並未經學者之研究、無從根據、故僅就當地沿刖之名稱列記之、其品質以荏梨最優、產量在百分之七十以上、秋白梨·馬蹄黃梨·白　梨次之</p>
<p>（三）整枝及施肥、萊人之業梨園者、平每畝約植十五株、枝幹矮小、平低擴散、樹形頗整、成年樹株、每屆春季、祇將枯死及過密之格剪去之、三四月間、撤布坑肥、（俗名坑洞）或廐肥、將表土掘起而混合之、冬季則灌以尿液、</p>
<p>（四）產量價格及運消、一·產量、梨株栽植七八年後即能結果、十年生者、生長暢茂、已達結果最盛時期、據土人云、樹齡有超越七八十年者、其最大收穫量、可達四五百斤之譜、平均每株產量約三十斤、以每畝十五株計算、年產共計一·八二二·五○○斤、（市斤）第斤合洋五分、共計洋九二二五元·二、價格萊梨之價格、以產地品質之不同、故價格亦隨之而有異、就荏梨而言、蘆兒港·照旺莊、所產者品質最優、價格京較昂貴、在本年市價、（九月）每斤約需洋五分至八分、其他各村所產者、約三分至五分、若擇其完整而無病蟲傷痕者、則價格較普通者常蛔倍蓰、三·運銷及包裝、萊梨產量、旣如上述、價格又極昂貴、故除其罹病蟲傷害較重者、不能向外運銷　、優良者以烟台爲惟一銷路、每屆秋季、農民臨時組織小販賣組合、（簡稱梨販）每組七八人至十數人、該項組織之主要條件、完全爲信用二字、故對於運送販賣會社等事、分别担任、其第一步交易手續、先向梨園接洽、將梨株劃定若干株、至成熟時、即以收穫量、按照市價議定價格、付欵之先後、全以兩方信用及需欵情形而定、運送時裝置於條筐内、周圍舖以草稿、每筐百斤、用驢騾運送、自萊陽至烟台、計程二四零里、每次需時三日、運費約在三四元之數、</p>
<h3>靑州蜜桃</h3>
<p>（一）產地、山野多而平原極少、與散置於田野隙地、其連實而爲片段者、僅有數處、故其栽植面積、無右考計、植栽區域、自雲門山以迄西南之孫旺莊、約七十里、南達二十里之養老院村、東至瀰河、西至郭莊、約五十里、北部僅及膠濟鐵路附近、西南部山嶺地帶、出產乾甜而脆、北部者品質較次、故西南一帶、可爲蜜桃之最適宜區域、</p>
<p>（二）產量價格及運銷、桃株之栽植三四年者、即能結果、五至十年生者、暢茂條達、已至結果最盛時期、平均每株約產八○、一○斤、祇以栽植極不規則、其整個產量、一時雖難統計、其爲數當不僅十數萬斤、八九月間之自然脫落者率多零保於本地、每斤價約二三分、其色澤鮮亮、而無重大病虫傷害者、則運銷於靑島·濰縣·博山·濟南·周村·各地而以靑島爲主要銷路、去歲之運往靑島者、約六百筐、共計約六萬斤、平均每斤價大洋一角、運送時、裝置於條筐内、周圍舖以草槁廢紙、由鐵路負責運輸、今年因爲蟲害嚴重、運銷極不安全、商人多視爲畏途、不敢經營、故外埠推銷者、僅爲園主之直接販賣、爲數無幾也、</p>
<h3>烟台菓品</h3>
<p>（一）產地及面積、烟台菓品、豐足優良、馳名遐邇、而其生產地域、非僅限於烟台市附近、如福山·牟平·棲霞·萊陽·各地所出菓品、皆　集於烟、運銷於外、查其生產區域、南至福山縣之鐵口（約九十里）王沿·（約四十里）東達牟平縣之王達子村·（約六十里）楚家莊·（約三十五里）西迄福山城·直抵棲霞、在此區域以内、因土質習慣之不同、菓樹之栽植亦略有差異、故在烟台以東、多產葡萄、至牟平略西、則產香蕉萍菓及洋梨、南中多產玫瑰香葡萄·及香蕉萍菓·大櫻桃·海棠菓、至王沿鐵口一帶、以香蕉萍菓及秋花皮萍菓爲大宗、西至棲霞、則產萊陽梨·香水梨、香蕉萍菓·山楂杮杏桃各種、中國小櫻桃、多出於棲霞之東南鄕、葡萄園之最大者、爲張容公司之東西兩園、面積約千畝、年產十萬斤、有品種六十餘、統計各種菓園所佔地域、除有少數者栽植於平野外、多爲山嶺·階段地、東西約百五十里、南北星片斷散佈於山嶺、其面積無可考計、萍菓園之最大者、爲烟台之西沙旺之葡園、（爲李載之所創辦）面積百五十里、約九十里専植香蕉秋花皮及甜萍菓、樹勢暢茂、正在結果最盛時期、</p>
<p>（二）種類及品質、烟台菓品、約有十數種、如洋梨·民</p>
<p>茄梨·甜水梨·中國梨、萍菓類之香蕉·紅魁·金星露靑·秋花皮·伏花皮·人靑皮·白沙蜜·及磅萍菓·中國萍菓·甜萍菓、海棠菓類之大海棠·小海棠·白海棠、葡萄類之玫瑰香·龍眼·朱奶·甜水、櫻桃類之紅櫻桃·黃櫻桃·黑櫻桃·及中國櫻桃等等、其品質之優劣、以土質及管理方法之異稍有不同、但以洋梨·香蕉·萍菓·玫瑰香葡萄·大櫻桃·爲最上品、銷路之廣、價格之高、亦以是爲最、其次爲秋花皮·伏花皮萍菓·及海棠菓、（三）整枝及施肥、烟台各地之菓園、梨·萍菓·櫻桃·栽植之行株距離、自一丈至一丈五尺、多用盃狀整枝、枝幹矮小、平等配列、葡萄爲水平整枝、棚架者極省、成年菓樹、第屆春秋時季、除其過密及已死枯枝、三四月間施用廐服一次、撒佈於地面、將表土掘起而混合之、冬季灌以尿液、至西沙旺之芝圃園、則於秋季施用魚肥、每株四斤至六斤、統計肥料之施用及用量之多寡、因人而異、其經濟比較困難者即或施肥、亦非常規</p>
<p>（四）產量價格及運銷、烟台菓品、每年之產量、因幅員廣袤、遍及福山·萊陽·牟平·棲霞·各地、故其確切數量、頗難統計、且就菓品而言、以萍菓爲大宗、香蕉萍菓、約佔二○　、伏花皮·秋花皮·約有五○　、中國萍菓、約有一○　、其次爲洋梨、中國梨約有一○　、至大靑皮·白沙蜜·海棠菓·葡萄等、約有一○　、數年以來、又因土質氣候及交通之關係、菓園事業、益見擴大、生產菓量、似應逐漸加增、奈以氣候之急變、病虫害之加重、其數反而减低、茲將二十年至二十二年之出口量、略述如下、（一）上海、二十一年一○·八一○六七六斤、二十二年七·五一○·二七五斤（運銷福州厦門杭州者亦在此數内）、（二）天津、二十一年一○·三八·八七一斤、二十二年六六七、一四七斤、（運銷北平者亦在此數内）、（三）大連·二十一年三·一六四·○一一斤、二十二年五·一五三·八九五斤、（四）香港、二十一年一·三七五五六○斤、二十二年七○一·三四九斤、（五）安東·二十一年一·二一七·一一三斤、二十二年五四九·八·一一斤、合計二十年一·　○○○·○○二斤、二十一年一七·六○六·二三五斤、二十二年·一四五八二·四八八斤、上述係菓行之報海關數、據云、每次出口、其不報關稅者、約有半數、因報告海關、則出入口時遲延時日、菓品易壞、故寗偷運而急速出售、如此推算、烟台之總出口量、非祇此數也、又其出口、以秋花皮萍菓爲大宗、中國梨及櫻桃次之、</p>
<h3>無錫</h3>
<p>興記絲廠倒閉糾紛南門外跨塘橋下塘九餘絲廠、前因絲市慘落、經營失敗、停車已久、本年六月間、始由邑人季雲初等集股、繼續營業、改牌號爲興記、詎最近季雲初忽又挾絲欵四千餘元、出走滬上、以致該廠週轉不靈捉襟見　、前日乃有鄕民三四十人、至該廠坐索繭欵、因季雲　避不到廠、致起糾紛、而廠中各女工職員、亦因伊等所有存工欠薪、共達四千餘元之鉅、恐廠方不能發放、故特推舉施文惠等爲代表、至帪房索薪、該廠以四面楚歌、無示維持、祗得於昨日起宣告停工、現全體職工、愈形恐慌、已準備將廠絲扣留不解、而坐索繭欵之鄕民、現仍集合廠中、擬將負責人扭請官廳救濟、</p>

<h3>汪院長切實否認集中現金</h3>
<p>經濟確在困難時期</p>
<p>政府自當盡力補救</p>
<p>希望美國購銀勿進行太驟</p>

<p>行政院長汪精衛、偕同鐵部次長曾仲鳴、昨晨由京來滬、延諾爾醫生檢視糖尿症宿疾、並探視鐵道部長顧孟餘、海軍部長陳紹寬、下午、會晤甫由港抵滬之王寵惠博士、並接見銀行界張公權、業於昨晚夜車返京、茲分誌各情於次、</p>
<p>在滬行動　汪氏於前晚十一時偕鐵道部次長曾仲鳴同乘京滬夜車出京來滬、於昨晨七時許抵滬、在南翔車站下車、卽換乘汽車返寓休息、九時許、汪氏卽電約諾爾醫生前往檢騐身體、至九時半始畢、旋江復偕曾仲鳴同往探視鐵道部長顧孟餘、海軍部長陳紹寬之疾、至午始返、據曾仲鳴氏談、汪氏此來、並無特殊任務、不過爲檢騐身體、及探視顧陳兩部長之疾、檢騐結果、據醫生報告、仍與平時相同、無甚變化、汪氏除於昨晚七時許與王寵惠及孔財長等會晤外、並於昨日下午四時十五分、接見中國銀行總經理張公權氏、談約四十餘分鐘、至五時正、張氏始辭出、</p>
<p>團結問題　汪氏昨語往訪者、據云、關於京粵合作問題、自粵財政廳長區芳浦北來以還、事實上已感覺到中央興粵桂雙方、日趨於親密之途、區氏到京時、並曾携來陳伯南氏致本人之書翰一通、内容表示對感電極端贊成、並主張决心勦匪、胡展堂先生北來事、有此可能、但何日成行、則不得而知、感電所主張者、經五中全會通過後、現正在中政會審查中、將來當有詳細之規定、</p>

<h3>財部與銀行界恊商穩定金融辦法</h3>
<p>外商運銀出口庫存稅减</p>
<p>華商銀行鈔票準備充足</p>
<p>中國社云、我國自財部實行徵收白銀出口稅、以爲防止大量流出、雖已見效、但國内金融、尚未十分穩定、財部因復與本市銀行界恊商穩定國内金融辦法、茲誌各情於后、</p>
<p>不安原因　據銀行公會林康侯氏昨語中國社記者、本埠銀行界庫存銳减、固爲不可掩之事實、但一查庫存銳减之銀行、則皆係外商銀行、至華商各銀行庫存、均極充足、未見若何减落、蓋華銀行遵奉政府明令、並不運銀出口、現其庫存數字、足可證明、至於邇來金融不安原因、實由於投機者亂造謠言、社會人士不明眞象、遂有藏銀之舉、日來年關在卽、銀根緊張、亦爲應有之現象、不足爲怪也、</p>
<p>恊商妥策　近年本市銀錢業、以受社會工商業不景氣影響、對於無切實担保及信用關係者、深感滿地荆棘、無處可以放欵、而工商業亦以市面蕭條、營業不振、難得銀錢業之信任、大有無從借欵、藉以調劑金融之苦、因此社會經濟、頗呈傳頓枯竭之象、致引起一般恐慌、財部爲謀補救安定金融起見、現正與此間銀行界·各領袖、作非正式會商救濟辦法、希望以官商合作之力量、妥籌善策、務使國内金融、得有切實保障、俾得早日穩定、以安社會云、</p>
<p>華銀充實　中國社云、本市現銀庫存、自美國大量收買白銀後、卽傳流出甚多、惟據調查結果、華商各銀行之庫存、並無减少、而所發行之鈔票、準備金料至爲充足、所謂銀行庫存銳减之數字、皆係外商銀行、運銀出口、必然之現象、於國内銀行界、實無重大關係、中國社記者、昨向銀行界查悉、至十一月份止、華商銀行發行鈔票額、及其準備金、數字甚詳、茲特列表於后、（元單位）</p>

<h3>故宮舞弊案春雲初展蕭襄沛被逮關防甚嚴</h3>
<p>蕭爲故博辦事員已被裁</p>
<p>因手續未清留滬處交替</p>
<p>新聲社云、轟傳一時之故宮博物院盜寳舞弊巨案、自本年十月十三日、由江寗法院檢察官彙集贓證起訴後、計串同盜寳舞弊易培基·李宗侗·陳郁·蕭瑜·崔夑邦·晏遠懷·秦漢功·董琳·張淞稽·等九人、一時雖贓證已得、而人犯潛匿、無從訊判、最高法院、當函平市府恊緝易培基等到案究辦、結果、消息沉寂、近在滬逮獲易親信蕭襄沛、解案訊辦、茲經新聲社記者探悉各情誌次、</p>
<p>蕭襄沛在故博經過　蕭襄沛爲湖南籍、易培基之鄕親、易培基於民國十八年被任爲北平故宮博物院長時、蕭卽因易之函召提携、得入故宮博物院供職、因蕭之爲人、賦性忠厚、寡言色笑、雖經易之提携、始終爲博物院一小辦事員耳、每月月薪九十元、蕭不多苟求、自安於職、易在任時盜寳舞弊、蕭正在平、旋九一八事變起、故都吃緊、古物南運、所有古物这裝箱工作、蕭亦參與其間、後更隨古物南來、卽留於滬辦事處内任職、名義仍爲辦事員、月薪照舊、亦無增减、</p>
<p>已被裁汰尙未離職　迨後故宮盜寳案發覺、易培基潛去、改由北大敎授馬衡担任院長一職、馬接事後、以故宮博物院冗員過多、乃禀呈當局、實行大批裁汰、蕭爲易之親信、且所任職並不重要、故亦在被裁汰之列、但因手續未了、故雖被裁汰、猶未能離去滬辦事處、昨日下午二時、在永安坊二十號故宮博物院駐滬辦事處内被逮、經特二院裁定移送上海地方法院、派員押解首都歸案訊辦、</p>
<p>家屬在滬舉室驚惶　蕭在滬原爲一身、一月前蕭妻始携子女三名來滬、寓於城内福佑路小世界右弄内、蕭遭逮捕、舉室驚惶、因係初來滬上、人地生疏、無從求援、而蕭被捕後、曾經第二特區地方法院熊彙苹推事略爲審訊、以關係盜寳巨案關防甚密、外間無從知其究竟、外傳蕭襄沛卽蕭瑜、實非其人、蕭瑜爲平農事試騐塲長、蕭襄沛實一小辦事員也、</p>
<h3>曹子來發明浮輪器試撈大運沉輪</h3>
<p>昨日當衆試騐</p>
<p>各方熱誠贊助</p>
<p>輪船沉没、各國均有撈救方法、獨我國尙無撈船器之發明、故每遇失事商輪、恒請日本人打撈、近國人曹子來耗數年之心血、専誠研求撈輪器、埋頭苦究、至今已告成功、昨日曹君特帶同發明撈船器、至航運俱樂部試騐、邀集滬上輪船保險業代表等參觀、記者亦隨李雲良·陳幹靑君·同往參觀、並與曹君面談當塲騐結果、頗爲滿意、今崇明外沉没大運輪、已由曹君用其發明器具、擔任撈救、殊有紀載之價値、故爲詳述之、</p>
<p>三項發明　曹子來崇明人、近年從事於物理學原理、研求海底科學、經數年之試騐與改良、業經發明、（一）浮輪器、用極堅固能任大力而有彈性與閉氣之物質、造成浮輪器、爲撈救沉海商輪之用（二）沉輪器、係掃滅海上浮輪、可使戰時减少敵艦目標、其計劃已密呈中央、（三）潛水衣、分軟體與硬壳兩項、軟體衣尤適合於我國國民性服用入海、今亦在製造中、　模型試演　曹氏浮輪器、已經成功近由招同局總稽核李雲良君之介紹、於昨日午後一時五十分、邀請滬上水險業全體代表、齊集廣東路十號航運俱樂部、當衆試騐撈船方法、曹君用大玻琍匣一、中間置滿清水即將特造鐵質模型輪一艘、船内容鐵比重七·八、較同量容沙泥二·三、加重五倍曹君對衆述明發明原理後即將發明浮輪器、係用空氣帶、緊聯在沉船四周、打氣入内沉輪即漸漸浮起、</p>
<p>原理相同　曹於試騐畢後、對衆又言、今次試騐、係用模型表示、但衆意如商輪沉海、用此方法打撈、則船體笨　、所用浮輪汽袋、當然亦須放大、事實上有否阻力、曹君又言、一立方尺水力重量爲六二·四磅、依此用擴大汽袋、袋以鋼絲組成、方足勝此浮托力、定可完全成功、今假定撈救一千六百噸之沉輪曹君言打撈極有把握、預計費用、萬金之資、即可撈起矣、</p>
<p>試撈沉輪　行駛上海崇明間大運輪、在崇外堡鎭港附近、沉没已多年、該船並未保險、亦未撈起、今曹君已自告奮勇、願以本人發明撈船器、打撈該輪、已向船東接洽、船東願出三萬二千元撈價、委曹打撈、滬上保險各輪公司、對曹君此舉亦表極端贊助、南通縣政府縣黨部、且經提出廿三次會議、由縣長金家華常委陳冠英等公决、一致贊助、藉資獎勵、</p>
<h3>棉業統計會昨發表全國棉產統計</h3>
<p>外棉輸入現已逐漸减少</p>
<p>本年新棉滬地尙未湧至</p>
<p>我國棉花產量、本年較往年增加百分之十以上、美印棉等輸入銳减、據棉業統計會昨日發表廿二年與本年全國產棉數量統計、茲摘錄如下、</p>
<p>輸入减少　據棉業統計會去年統計全國產棉九百七十七萬四千二百零七担、本年份第二次估計全國產棉一千一百十七萬二千五百五十三担皮棉、今年與去年相較、本年產量增加一晨卅九萬八千三百四十六担、在二十一年中國紗廠採用美棉約一百萬大包、截至本年上半年、外棉輸入漸少、現已降至十七萬包、預料下半年爲數猶不及此、原因有三、（一）因美棉價昂、（二）匯兌太貴、（三）中國棉產量增加、故今年一月至十月止、進口外棉、約一百四十餘萬担、上年全年共約二百萬担、本年减少原因、卽係國内棉產增加、嗣後進口、將一年减少一年、</p>
<p>共用棉花　據華商紗廠聯合會統計、去年下半年與今年上半年全國紗廠共用棉花、計如下表、</p>
<p>二十三年上半年　二十二年下半年</p>
<p>中棉　九一九、二七九　八四一、七○九</p>
<p>美棉　一七五、六五二　三四一、三六六</p>
<p>印棉　八八、三○六　九七、○六○</p>
<p>埃及棉　八、四四九　九、八二八</p>
<p>其他　一、一六六　三二八</p>
<p>共計　一、一九二、八五二　一、一九○、二九○</p>
<p>上數爲包每包五百磅、</p>
<p>新棉未至　我國產棉區域、以陜西·山東·河北·湖南·等省爲最多、棉花在十月左右、卽已上市、往年滬地到貨甚湧、本年則未見湧到各廠主持者、頗覺詫異、及後派員前往調查、始明眞相、原因有四、（一）今年秋季、北方多雨、南方亢旱、棉花生長較遲、比往年要遲二十天至一個月、（二）今年北方西北棉農、因上年大麥收成甚好、今年棉產又豐收、現在所種之麥又好、經濟狀况良好、對於棉花不急售現、故上市求售者甚少、皆爲鄕民所囤積、以求善價、（三）今年棉價、雖較往年高、而鄕人貪心不足、不肯脫售、類皆居奇、（四）新花產地、如陜西·靈寳·等處、因隴海路貨車調撥不便、因此皆躉積於棧房、候有空車、方能南下、有此數因、故本年新棉、迄至現下、尙未見旺至、</p>

<h3>友誼足球賽復旦勝東華</h3>
<p>結果三比二</p>
<p>復旦大學足球隊於江大賽中、雖小挫于曁南、然其訓練之勤、與聯絡之佳、早爲人士所稱揚、該隊爲觀摹技術起見、日昨午後三時特約東華隊作友誼賽於該校球塲、東華主墏　麟經等、均親自出馬、終以塲地不熟、兼以有輕敵之意、竟以二對三敗北、茲將詳情略誌后、</p>
<p>上半時　雙方排好陣綫、由隨鐘恩執法、相持二對二不下者五分鐘、陳洪志截得來球、一脚摕去、周達雲冷箭不防、竟告中的、復旦激奮之餘、將士用命、東華頻頻告險、余順章兩度叩門、均被門將救出、東華後衛保駕心切、竟以手吻球、由余順章主罰、毛腿起處、阿斗應聲入網、束華豈是弱者、戴中鋒率領兵馬、捲土反攻、均因操之過急、無功而返、不久、復旦被罰角球、踼來恰到好處、許竟成迎之以頭、遂又中的、復旦經此、全軍　進、余順章輕輕一挑、龔子文得了援濟、於二十碼外、飛腱橫掃、姿勢美妙、球去急如矢發、范守門措手不及、球遂入網、四　掌聲如雷、此後、你來我往、上半時遂告終了、</p>
<p>下半時　檸檬時間後、雙方換塲作戰、東華咄一對零咄逼人、均因射門欠凖、失之交臂、一刹那、李義臣盤球深入、就十五碼處舉足急射、幸周達雲挽救有方、得免於難、乃復旦否極泰來、以美妙迅速之短遞、傾師　攻、東華陣地、險象環生、於最後五分鐘、逼成角球、陸秀文開球得法、唐賢幹於亂軍中踼入一球、遂定江山、東華仍想背城一戰、奈時不我待、銀笛長嘯、於焉告終、復旦以三比二勝、</p>
<p>雙方球　綜觀是戰、復旦聯絡純熟、前後呵成藝槪觀　一氣、得勝並非僥倖、東華之敗由於人馬不齊、個人球藝、自各有千秋、李寗陳洪光　勇善戰、李義臣上半時倒串中堅、似不稱職、戴中鋒之傳遞頗爲巧妙、復旦後衛關張兩將、穩健有加、前鋒余順章龔子文、均有可取之處、惜兩翼較弱耳、雙方陣綫如次、</p>

<h3>糧食粉市廠方抛售漸少</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近平　定之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小四分、坎拿大小四分不等、當開價時、本月份因交割日近一日、業外多頭、從事了結、故開價即見軟勢、遠期各月份、　雙方交易甚清、暫呈互擯、（北帮現粉去路仍見活絡）迫至下千開盤後、各月份交易、仍未暢旺、廠方籌碼、以洋麥未定、當少抛售、市塲趨勢、　無起色、跌則亦難、該始終盤旋如常、近期則客銷　徵見疲懈寂、　　本月份跌一分一月份跌一分二厘半、二月份跌七厘半、三月份跌一分、四月份跌二厘半、五月份未動云、</p>
<p>麵粉交易因國　結賬、各月份交易、均拍止本月二十六日爲止、定明年一月三日照常開市</p>
<h3>本月期麥多頭了結</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平疲之態、以洋麥報價　小四分至八分不等、上午開價、各月份交易、依然清淡、價較前日小去一二分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因交割已近、多頭紛紛了結、套頭則多觀望未動、價遂愈鬆、一月份因近期轉跌、亦爲滯落、此種情形、實因結賬之　、業内外减少投機所致也、結果本月份較跌四分、一月份跌五分、二月份跌二分、現麥市面、因　胃未動、仍無做開云、</p>
<p>雜糧交易所國歷結賬、本月份小麥拍至二十六日爲止、其餘遠期各月份、拍至本月份二十九日爲止、至明年一月三日照常開拍云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、冬麥耕種面積計四千四百三十十萬六千英畝、作物狀况係通常之百分之七十七·八、澳洲與阿根廷新麥行將有大宗輸出、市面雖不致發生巨大反動、但買戶則因而多存觀望、</p>

<h3>年底伊邇米價略挫</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、現貨本客胃口均淡、因年低收束與銀根關係所阻滯、惟期貨則内地與本街均　、蓋以今庚江浙秋收不豐、一　囤戶均在望好中、惟洋商抛售亦　、日來兜售更力、昨日又開　　碎米一千四百噸、回籠小絞一百噸、此外又由雅　兜傳蘭黃之茄　地米、計有額子二月份糙米二千噸、價四元六角六分、三月分機米一千五百噸、價五元一角二分、合價旣廉、又合内地及紹甬去胃、致爲業中注意、一說午後已山内地本街分去、現洋米開出八百包、客秈爲本街暢　、開出八千七百六十包、行情則以年關之故均見疲小三五分云、</p>
<h3>麩皮回籠貨不少</h3>
<p>麩皮市况、略帶軟弱、因近來洋莊不動、内地帮之銷胃、則見活躍、惟回籠貨回出、以致價反轉疲也、福新現麩喊二元七角凈盤、雜牌麩喊二元七角扣盤云、</p>
<h3>黃豆銷場愈益開展</h3>
<p>丨丨芝蔴　莊價跌角半丨丨</p>
<p>昨黃豆依然堅穩　本埠廠家、因見錫常帮豆胃强健、市恐步騰故入胃搜辦、共讦採去歸　豆八千餘包、價扯三元五角七分、錫常去一千六百包、價爲三元五角半、又開漢口乍豆三千餘包價自三元三角七至　角半、由錫常本街分去漢車豆開一千四百包、亦　錫常去　、廣帮採取牛莊白眉豆一千六百包、價爲四元一角至零五分、本街辦　域大粒豆一百五十包、價爲四元三角、漢　　二百包、價爲三元二角八、行情較前市又漲三四分、後情如辦　蟬聯、來源减少、可望樂觀、芝蔴洋莊價續跌　　半、由沙遜辦去五百　、價爲九元零五分、主因銀根關係貨戶賤兜故市態年内恐不易振、市塲中現貨交易亦清、市價又跌四五分、計東洋帮去歸德蔴四百七十餘包、價爲六元六角、又豪州蔴一百五十包、價爲六元五角、本街採去六合蔴六十包、價爲六元作角三分、</p>
<h3>疋頭法西襯日貨暢銷</h3>
<p>法西襯銷路現爲最旺盛時代、厚莦大衣皆須襯用、售價亦以目下爲最佳、近以日貨湧到、價目則反見下降、愛二七七牌子、已由五角降至四角八分半、蓋上週日貨法西襯進口二十包、價每碼由四角降至三角七分、洋服裁縫大半均購用、致愛二七七牌子亦不得不下降矣、而國貨法西襯售價仍不動、烘盛貨依然批售四角、雜牌次號貨每　四碼云云、</p>
<h3>五金白鐵瓦底貨閙慌</h3>
<p>白鐵瓦　建築房屋之必需品、大棧房及鐵路房屋之建築莫不需用於此、每屆黃梅時節、此貨出路必十分興旺、惟今　適得共反、蓋天時亢旱、各處市面不　、是以出路大受　擊、各同業所預定之貨、則紛紛裝來、有貨滿之患、標準行　、雖同業竭力維持、但終於下游、斯時執貨者痛受蝕、　毫不敢定貨、所以四五月來　無現貨裝來、但本埠存底則日銷月售、底貨大缺、是以各業欲訂講者、幾有無貨可購之嘆、茲將各花色　勞分誌於下</p>
<p>（二十四號）此貨存底雖尙較豐、但成本極大、是以同業扳價極　、尙無下降之勢、價每擔估十一元四角、查前昨交易共有二百餘擔、係虹口　拆去、聞爲京滬鐵路工程處所買、市上存底尙有二千七八百擔、苟年内若無到貨、明春恐亦斷擋、</p>
<p>（二十六號）此貨市上已告缺貨、查同業執存此貨者、祗可　鐵行及新仁昌五金號二家、行情每擔估十二元六角半、比上日又好起二角半、聞買客方面尙在吸收、趨勢續好、</p>
<p>（二十八號）前昨漢口靑島各帮、均有採辦、而本街廠家點綴亦好、行情每擔售十三元五角、比前亦硬起一角、存貨亦殊涸溥、勢看再好、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能差任敎平視西賓何足　空辱虚心</p>
<p>賈多才覺得對於這樣一個逃難的女子，其價値也不過聯勝於蟲豸，愛而加諸膝，惡而沉諸淵，那都没關係。只是這兩個德國人來拜會，這未可小視。也並不是就怎樣的看重了德國人，因爲有了外國人來拜會，這就可以抬高自己的身價。好說，外國人都是瞧不起中國人的，特意的慕名拜訪，是瞧得起而又瞧得起，這身分就高了。他如此的設想，就不提是怎樣的高興，立刻自己動手，把桌上的茶壺茶碗，香烟筒子，都歸併傍邊一張小桌上，層次井然的放着。將箱子打開，取了一個白布包袱鋪在桌上，　了桌布，網籃　放了幾本洋裝的中國舊小說疊在桌子角上。客中没有鋼筆藍墨水之類，就放了幾枝鉛筆和幾個洋式信封在書邊，這表示這是一個辦公室的組織，而且是個學者的態度。不過幾本書還不足以表示學問是怎樣的好，因之又打開箱子，把銀行　所命令塡的表册之類，都搬了在桌上，好在這上面全是中國字，足可以把外國人虎上一陣，他能知道這内容是什麽？預備得好了，又呌茶房來掃了一遍地，床鋪上都撣過了灰，這才安神坐下將十餘年前念的英文，默了幾句，如「豪都由都」等類的句子，都念念有詞的，在嘴裏背過了。好在他們是德國人，英語也不見得會好，只要自己能對付幾句，表示是個也能說外國話的，那也就够了。他這樣在屋子裏演習那外交儀式，不多會子，聴到窗子外一陣雜亂皮鞋聲，他想着，這必是外國來賓了，就沉住了氣不動，靜等人進來。（九六）</p>
<h3>殘留</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>因爲自己亦是人世間弱者之羣的一員，對於悽慘的蟲嗚，便象徵了人們的嘆息和哀歌。可是，現在蟲聲早已寂然了，只有寒風在紙窗外示威，這是冷酷嚴肅的季節呵丨在晨露凝固成霜的時候，一切蟲類都死僵或蟄伏起來。但是，在我紊亂的小樓上，還有一個躱在紙糊篾裏的『呌哥哥』。蟲類的殘留呢，從幼時直到現在，我是有着一顆愛護弱小蟲類的心的。</p>
<p>記着，那時是適宜於『呌哥哥』生存的夏季巳經消逝了，它可還留存在瑩姑家的窗簷下，當午後陽光照上窗紗的片刻，我在伊家裏看書刋或讀報，總聽見那個殘留的微弱的生命振着翅翼兒作掙扎似的哀鳴，邊在篾籠裏遲緩地爬動着，不時把兩支前腿伸出空縫來，碧綠的翅翼兒已呈現了棕色。『不會再使它延長些生命嗎？設法把弱小者從嚴酷的時令中拯救出來吧』丨我要求瑩姑把它從窗簷下移進内室，再給裹上一憎皮紙使它得到適宜的溫度。</p>
<p>瑩姑雖然照我的話做了，可是，伊總笑我有點痴氣，以爲微細如蟲類的生命是不値得這樣去關心的，弱小者只該毁滅在環境裏（？）。</p>
<p>氣候是一天冷似一天了，在瑩姑家裏早就聽不到『呌哥哥』的鳴聲，撳起裹着的皮紙瞧瞧籠裏，它像標本一般呆着不動，後來又悄悄地爬動起來，一回兒可又停止了。於是，我知道這微細的生命將毁滅於旦夕。便顧不了瑩姑的諷笑，把它要到自己的小樓上。反籠裏塞滿棉花，四週糊起兩層皮紙，祇留一個小孔透洩氣流，放在溫暖的地方，這樣，據說便可以使它耐過塞冬。</p>
<p>眼前正値冷酷嚴肅的季節的進行期，却還有一個微弱的蟲類蟄伏在我辮亂的小樓上，我爲弱小者改造環境而使之延長生命，這於我是一種欣慰吧。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （波光）</p>
<p>（點滴）××先生在演講席上高談土布救國，很受聽衆拍手歡迎。講畢散會。××先生回到家裏說去土布長衫，換得一身挺秀西裝，履　郆　，赴情人之約。這是中國社會上絕頂聰明的人！</p>
<p>中委吳稚　說：「中國人只有口，没有乎，都是能說不能做的。」道句话眞是不錯。（波光）</p>
<h3>火獄</h3>
<p>— 闌删</p>
<p>「這豈不是人間活地獄！」</p>
<p>每次經過那些打鐵的店舖，心中便這樣的想着，不論什麽季節，他們的鍊鐵爐總是紅紅的。雖然爐是紅着，其他一切却都是黑的。店基特别地比人家低，坐了下去，地上完全是黑泥，牆邊壁角，堆滿着許許多多鐵棒鐵頭，檯子椅子多是橫七竪八的斜放着，一似噴過黑漆般的顏色。當那個老成的伙伴在爐裏夾起一塊通紅的鐵餅，放在鐵墩上時，立刻來了一個小夥計，拿着大鎚輪流地敲着，火星飛进，飛落在他俩的脚上，飛落在那個呆坐着在拉風箱的學徒的額上。鐵末做了塵埃，飛揚滿座，各人的面目都難以認清，煤屑代替了雪花膏司丹康的用途，把他們的頭髮耳目口鼻都染了一層灰黑的薄幕。幸而現今天氣冷了，在這熱烘烘的爐邊工作着，却是驅寒的好所在。你還不曾看見他們在炎炎盛暑中的受罪，丨赤膊短褲，兩眼發出紅光，面上粗筋凸起，全身蒸出大汗，烟灰煤屑乘機進襲，侵佔了各個人的身體。那繼是苦痛！那繼是活受罪！</p>
<p>現在不過初冷的時候，然而鐵店裏小伙伴們的雙手，又是紅腫着了。同是一樣的謀生，有的却是快活到如登天堂，有的慘苦如降落地獄。人們的娛樂塲所，没有這一羣可憐者的足跡，終日只在火獄裏苦練着，磨難着。我經過那些鐵店時，心中總很不安地思量一陣。</p>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>夥計咱們還有一個関要過呢</p>
<h3>有所思</h3>
<p>— 龍鍾</p>
<p>一個黃道吉日，坐在家裏聽得街上走過的吹鼓手，吹吹打打，好不熱閙。走在街上，又看見酒菜館門前紅字燈籠一列放着十多盞，燈燭煇煌的，多少氣槪。這時忽然遐想起來：每一個所謂黃道吉日，究竟撮合成幾對好因緣？造成幾對怨偶？又有幾許有情人歡喜地成了眷屬？又要破壞多少人的貞操？記得基督敎徒茁以羅姆說過一句話：『婚姻至少是一件罪惡！』覺得也有至理</p>
<p>看見報紙上載着某公司招考書記的廣告，我又想到，這次不知又有幾十個，其至幾百個「書毒頭」要嘗到失望的滋味了！</p>
<p>參觀市立動物園，我立時發生了一點感想：人，也是一種物，何不關在鐵棚門裏同狐狸猴子一起陳列着？假使把罪犯關幾個起來，讓市民參觀參觀，倒也是一種大有裨益的辦法。</p>
<p>偶然在門首拾起了一朶憔悴了的「抗難馨」，我感覺得人生太殘酷無情了。一朶鮮花同一個年輕姑娘相仿的，我小心地把那朶被遺棄了的「抗難馨」用絲巾拂凈了，用小巧精致的錦盒裝了　，並且寫二百個熱情的字，在錦匣後面，致我的一番小意思。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>吻的珍聞</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>好久以前，我在春秋上發表過一篇「吻的集錦，」而最近在西文報上，又發現了不少「吻的珍聞，」因爲很有趣味，便集在一起而寫在下面。</p>
<p>吻的罰金　一個旅行家，到了蘇聯的莫斯科，便立刻發生了一件驚奇的事件，便是爲了他在火車中，和他的妻接了吻，便處他五鎊的罰金。他說爲了伊身體覺得不十分好，因此他預備和伊親幾個吻，使伊快慰一些，不料他才接好吻，車上的憲兵便來問他要罰金了，根據蘇聯的法律，在火車上，在汽車上，或是公衆的地方接吻，是違法而要處罰的？無論接吻的一對是夫妻或不是夫妻，一樣處罰。莫斯科闻近更通過一條法令，便是着所有的出租汽車，都須在光亮的地方駛行。</p>
<p>吻的攝影　在银幕的上面；我們時常看見男女明星在表情緊張的時候會擁抱着接吻，然而自聲片發明，替代默片而後，關於攝吻的鏡頭，爲了同時要有接吻的聲音，所以不可假借了。梅蕙絲是好萊塢一顆很紅的明星，伊拍攝一張新片的時候，要拍一個接吻的鏡頭而且第一個吻要聽得出嘴唇顫動的聲音。一切都齊備，導演一聲命令，「梅小姐，接得輕快些，」梅便和主演的男角接吻了。那知結果聲音大輕了，再來一次，太重了。一連接了不知多少吻也没有拍好這個鏡頭。眞使梅蕙絲怒火直冒了。最後，導演的聰明，想出在在收音機上紥塊絲巾，才算拍成了這吻的鏡頭。</p>
<p>吻的情書　悉尼地方，有一位萊斯布克夫人，寫了一封信給住在愛沙尼的情人，另外附帶一個包裹，爲了信的裏面，有「和你接一千個吻」一句而便被伊的丈夫訴請離婚。至於包裹之中，便是臘腸。伊的情人呌柯克，伊的信這樣寫法：「我親愛的馬丁柯克，我很平安的回到家裏，西亞早已醒了，我知道他一定曉得我整夜在外面。我什麽都是你的，我的思想也全部盤繞在你的周圍丨和你接一千個吻，我親愛的孩子。現在我送你一些臘腸，西亞很注意的看我，忽然地說我爲什麽不生一個孩子，假如這臘腸現在不很好，那麽祇要煮五分鐘，味道便好了。」柯克的回答：「希望你在夢中會我丨你的大孩子。」爲了這兩封信，最著重當然是「……和你接一千個吻……」便由法庭判决，宣告離婚了。</p>
<p>吻的仇敵　自有歷史以來，所謂戀愛，已佔據了人類生活的一大部。女人爲了愛而生存，男人就爲愛而死亡，孩子們就是愛的結晶，而一般詩人雅士，所寫的詩歌小說，也十九以戀愛爲描寫的落點。就是不識字的人們，也會很自然的高唱着民間的情歌，而男女之間，愛一經成熟之後，不拘文明和蠻野，有一個共同的公式，便是用吻來表演，不拘蠢夫愚婦，到了愛的高峰之時，便會不知不覺的抱着狂吻。可是這裏也有例外，在北非洲却有若干民族中，一般婦女，都不懂得接吻的，伊們雖至老死也不和人接一甜吻，要是有男人要和伊們接吻，親嘴，便會當做寃家，無疑的。在這世界之中，伊們也許是吻人仇敵了。</p>

<h3>鉛板蓄電池的自製</h3>
<p>— 永昌</p>
<p>關於蓄電池的自製，似乎没有人談過，現在將我經騐所得介紹一下。蓄電池的價格，一個甲電需二三元，乙電就要十幾元，假如能够自製，所費總共不到三元。</p>
<p>（一）材料</p>
<p>凈鉛　向鉛錫店或汽車行等處購買。</p>
<p>硫酸　向西藥房購買，第磅約四角。二氧化鉛　亦可向西藥房購買，或用硝酸與桃丹。（向中國藥店購買）共熱卽得爲稯粉末。</p>
<p>凈鉛粉　此粉不易購得，可向中國藥店購蜜陀僧替代。</p>
<p>（二）製造</p>
<p>先用極薄之木板一塊作底樣，再用黏土製成模型二塊，待模型硬固後，在模型上刻許多並行的槽，槽與槽之間的隔，大約有半寸，（如圖）然後把二片模型合上澆入融鉛，做成的鉛板，兩面就有凸出的格子紋子。把這種鉛杯做成幾塊。</p>
<p>把做所的鉛板，一半作爲陽極，格子裏面塗滿二氧化鉛和硫酸的混合物。一半作爲陰極，格子裏面塗滿了凈鉛粉，或蜜陀僧和硫酸的混合物，把這兩組鉛板相間隔的敖入玻璃中，每個陰極與陽極之間，均須用絕綠體隔開，最後以一份硫酸和十份蒸溜水的混合液（注意須將硫酸緩注入蒸溜水内，均勿將蒸溜水注入硫酸，否則有爆炸之危險。）加入玻璃瓶中，接連各陰極板和陽極板成陰陽二極，上面再用松香封口，就成一只完美的蓄電池了。</p>
<p>這種蓄電池的電壓，充足電的時候是一○八弗打，電流要看板的面積而定，大約每對陰極和陽極的面積有十二方寸時，就有一安培的電流，自製的蓄電池，效力雖不如售品，但價却便宜了許多，讀者諸君，何妨一試。</p>
<h3>最新小型橡實眞空管</h3>
<p>— 貽孫</p>
<p>最近美國RCA公司對於小型眞空管的製造，已經宣告成功，同時市面上也巳有該種眞空管出售，他定名RCA955Acorntube橡實眞空管，價格也相當便宜，製造這種眞空管的目的，在欲使他内部各電極間的容量减至極小，特别對於超短波接收不會發生各項弊病。至於用他來接收廣播或别的波長也是有很好的效力。</p>
<p>講到這眞空管的體積，祗有橡子那麽大小，高度爲一又十六分之一英寸，闊祗一英寸，　（接綫頭也在内）這眞空管的各種性質和平常37號的差不多，他也是個三極管，但有間接加熱的陰極，燈絲用六三弗打燃點，一六安培，屏柵間的容量爲1·4mmrdi　,柵陰間的容量是mmre屏陰間的容量爲6mmjd，可謂極小。</p>
<h3>成音週率阻流圈之代用品</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>在代乙電之濾波電路中，成音週率阻流綫圈是一件少不了的東西。但是設計準確，堅固耐用的成音週率阻流綫圈，代價很高。我們爲經濟起見，不妨改用一種代用品，這代用口就是我們常用的耗阻器。</p>
<p>用耗阻器代替成音週率阻汉綫圈，對於阻流能力似乎略爲孫色些；但是亦有相當的長處·一：代價低廉；二：佔地極小；三：因成音週率阻流綫圈之鐵心而引起之配合作用，用耗阻器代替後可以避免。</p>
<p>關於這種耗阻器的歐姆數，須看機中的眞空管而决定，只要不過份將乙電壓降落就可以了。在普通用二七或三七等眞空管的二三管機，大約用三千或四千歐姆。眞空管隻數加多，部麽歐姆數可以减少些。假使機中有强力成音週率擴大，歐姆數更應减小，詳細數目。可以試騐决定。這耗阻的瓦特數，普通一瓦特亦不致於十分發熱，在有强力成音週率擴大的，有三瓦特亦可以了，能用大些當然更好。</p>
<h3>單管礦石兩用機</h3>
<p>— 蔡日新</p>
<p>Ａ一四一號管是飛利浦廠的出品，它的構造是雙網式丨雙柵極，放大力極高，陰極電壓很低，所用的B電，電壓十幾弗打巳是够了；所以這種眞空管爲業餘家所珍視。這裏介紹一隻選擇性優良，音量高超的單管機。我們知道礦石機的所以下會淘汰，因爲它有不用電的好處，這隻單管機上的綫路，加上礦石，便成二用機。綫路見圖：</p>

<h3>低週率放大交連電路</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>（乙）電阻交連</p>
<p>如圖三所示，此式交連法，自交流機盛行以來，應用漸廣，蓋其所具優點非變壓器交連所能及也。第一此式因無周率性故對於任何周率之放大效能，均極圓滑一致；第二因無並聯諧振現象，而使言語音樂之各周率同獲相等之放大，故毫無夫眞弊病。此外因用四五極管作檢波，其交流屏阻極高，非以較大値之電阻交連不克爲功，故以電阻交連爲最佳，雖然此式在應用時，其放大率僅限於眞空管之本身，且須備高値乙電，然因有五極强力輸出管之問世，及交流電之通行，困難亦迎刃而解矣。</p>
<h3>圖三</h3>
<p>普通以爲欲得輸出較大之電力，非以變壓器交連作推挽式不可，其實不然，電阻交連亦未嘗不可作推挽式放大，僅須多加一反相位之眞空管卽可矣，見圖四·A，惟此管之前後電壓須相同，不然將發生失眞現象。</p>
<h3>圖四</h3>
<p>（丙）混合阻力交連</p>
<p>此式交連法與前述之電阴交連頗多相類，如圖五所示，所異者，前管屏極電流之變化，傳遞至後管柵極之電壓變動，所經者，並非電阻，而爲誘導率與電容量並聯之總阻，此式交連法因其誘導迥阻較屏路微分電阻爲大，故電壓放大比率將等於該眞空管之放大係數。</p>
<h3>圖五</h3>
<p>欲得較高之電壓放大比率，則以混合阻力交連電阻交連爲佳，蓋第一以　　　　之　　甚大。同時阻力甚小，故無需以高　電壓加諸屏極，第二，輸入次管柵極之電壓卽等於屏流與交連電阻或迥阻之乘積，且此式交連法，屏路内加入　阻後之總阻，此諸加入同量電阻之總阻爲小，故屏流較大，則跨交連　阻之電位降，亦卽輸入後管之電壓自較高也，因是此法較電阻交連爲佳也。</p>
<p>圖六所示者亦爲混合阻力交連之一種，名爲並聯屏壓　電式，乃爲普通避免變壓器交連時之磁力綫　飽和狀態而設，其效用甚佳，蓋旣爲混合阴力交連，亦不失愛莊器交連時之優點也，普通有以電阻代低週率阻流圈者，乃隨設計而異。</p>
<p>此外尙有直接交連一種，因應用較鮮，而又較爲繁複，故不贅。</p>

<h3>本年度無綫電材料之輸入</h3>
<p>我國因工商業幼稚，無綫電材料，尙多仰給於舶來，本年輸入數較去年顯有增加，茲據外報記載如下。</p>
<p>本年十個月無綫電機及另件輸入中國者，計美貨一·三四八·四○元，日本貨一九七·○二二元，德貨一四二·三四○元，英貨一○八·八五六元，荷蘭貨六四·九四一元，其他各國三六·三九七元，共計一·八九八·一五八元。除復往外洋者八·○八二元外，共輸入數一·八九○·○七六元，合國幣數爲三百七十二萬三千六百六十九元，較去年同期之二·九三六·○三五元增加八十餘萬元。</p>
<p>由此可見我國欲提倡無綫電事業，尙須努力於國人自製機件俾得减少漏巵也。</p>

<h3>眞空管與音質</h3>
<p>— 顧耀明</p>
<p>自製一架四管交流機，二四高放，五六檢管，四七放大，八○整流。揚聲器用電動式，　　零件都適合。製成後，音質異當惡劣，收音且帶糢糊；用電喝頭（pickup）放音，音質很好，這一定是高放問題，檢查的結果；因二四管擱置過久，我購買時未經試騐。絲板與幛隔極間，似有一種無需之氣體洩出，變成藍光，以致音質糢糊惡劣。丨曾經試騐，如圖，B十接在幛隔極上，以後知道眞空管對於音質，也有密切關係。</p>
<h3>成音週率變壓器的比率的簡單測量法</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>成音週率變壓器的比率，有一個簡單的測量法，用的儀器不過是一只能量至四十五弗打的交流電壓表，和一個電鈴方棚（或用電源變壓器次級的低壓圈代替）測量時，先將電鈴方棚的初級接至電源綫上，次級接至這成音週率變壓器的初級上，然用用交流電壓表量這成音週率變壓器次級的電壓，將此數用電鈴方棚次級綫圈手電壓數來一除，即得此成音週率變壓器的比率。例如有一成音週率變壓器的次級綫圈的電壓照上法量出爲十五弗打，所用電鈴變壓的次級是六弗打，用六除十五得商數爲二·五，所以知道這成音週率變壓器的比率爲二·五。</p>
<h3>收音機上日常遇到的困難和補救法（續）</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>（五）怪呌聲（HowlingNoise）（收音機内聽到狂風般的閙聲）原因　補救的方法</p>
<p>（一）蓄電池電量用盡　充電或更換</p>
<p>（二）B電池電壓太高　設法减小（用低壓電池或挿入適當耗阻。）</p>
<p>（三）柵極綫路内耗阻不佳　更換較佳的耗阻。</p>

<h3>杜思退益夫斯基，蕭伯納，和皮蘭台羅</h3>
<p>— 天人</p>
<p>在皮蘭台羅的眼目中，世界反正是個「謊」，大家都帶着一個假面具，北着「本能的良心」，說「謊」話度生活，人間的理性生活在笑，本能的「生」却在暗地裏掉眼淚，眞實的生活使作者煩惱起來，「六個尋找家的人物」裏便是這樣。</p>
<p>從這裏出發，到他寫成了「和過去一樣，比從前好」（ＣomePrimaＭegliod民</p>
<p>iprima)以後，他的哲學更飛躍了，將「六個尋找作家的人物」中的「現實」與虚構的部分，都變成幻想了。</p>
<p>最後幻想還覺得不够，索性使瘋狂的人物出場，「亨利四世」（ＥnricoＩＶ）中的主人公就是這樣一個人物。</p>
<p>實生活使作者懊惱了，不用說逼懊惱是從現實的社會所引起的懷疑而使然的。以後便怎樣呢，諷刺吧，那有啥辦法呢？除掉諷刺之外，想諷刺，非使半瘋狂的人物表現得不痛快。</p>
<p>皮蘭台羅的世界觀就是這樣，先將杜思退益夫斯基，和他比較一下，在創作的出發點上，他俩是有共同之點的。</p>
<p>皮蘭台羅說人生是二重性的，人生中有「正」和「不正」，理性的社會裏只有使人的本能悲慘與不幸發生。他帶着憤怒望着這些。</p>
<p>杜思退益夫斯基的寫實主義裏也有對社會的不平的質素，我們讀了「罪與罰」，就可以明白，在杜氏的作品裏有着「預言」的成分，但皮蘭台羅對人生總是表示「懷疑」。</p>
<p>在「亨利四世」裏，主人公就是一位吉訶德，什麽社會，一切乍着都不順眼，就回到十一世紀去吧，穿上了古帝王的衣飾，就這樣神精質的混下去。如果不是對現實的生活懷疑還用得着發狂麽？但總歸得吃人間的飯，一天從馬上跌了下來，方如大夢一塲，把他又從矛盾的生活中拖了回來，一看自己的心愛的愛人已經成了别人的妻，這一氣又把他氣了回去，結果演出了流血的悲劇，這又是個吉訶德，他就想不出個辦法來解决現實，只是懷疑。</p>
<p>他在短篇小說Ｌaprapcole裏這樣說：</p>
<p>「生的某種形式便是死，我們只知道我們是些被困着的人們，你總歸不能使他將我們抛開來，向着死的路上，早已註定了我們的存在了。」</p>
<p>這是由懷疑而引起的幻滅的悲哀，能說他與杜思退益夫斯基一樣麽。</p>
<p>還有幽默的成分，在近代的意大利文學中也很重要，諸如與皮蘭台羅同時的潘基尼（ＡＮanzini）根柏尼爾（Ｃampanile)，都被稱爲幽默大師，因爲對現實的社會懷疑，所以要申訴不平，頑强的要踼倒理性，替本能找出路，主人公往往從悲劇裏發出不健康的諷笑，所以幽默是最好的不二法門。</p>
<p>皮蘭台羅的幽默，和老年的蕭有些相像，但仔細說他和蕭不一樣，而是對立着的。</p>
<p>兩人同是對舊的社會不滿，都是以諷笑的口吻來否定舊的社會制度。蕭的幽默，好像是帶着批判的意味，皮蘭台羅的幽默只是空中的嘲笑，這終歸是有「畫虎」之譏，幽默而搔不到癢處，更是平俗無聊，空口諷咏有何用處？</p>
<p>有的說蕭是「依老賣老」，但皮蘭台羅比他也年少不了幾十春秋。</p>
<h3>在海防</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>在冷清清的火車裏，縮脚縮手的挨了半夜，海防便遠遠的在望了。</p>
<p>巍峨高聳的大厦，閃爍着明亮的電燈，漆黑的天幕下，給千萬電燈的光輝，映得那末火紅的。</p>
<p>遙遠的那邊，是白茫茫的一片大海，被夜色籠罩着的田野廟，耀着疏疏的幾點燈光，這深夜裏的海防，誰知竟是這末清麗可愛，使生長在農村裏的靑年人的心，活躍起來了。</p>
<p>滿裝着亮晶晶的水的田裏，浴着昏黃的幾盞電燈，聽說，這是用以捕魚的，這玩意眞是來得新鮮。</p>
<p>車到海防後，在混亂的嘈雜聲裏，躍上了車，便急急忙忙的，好像逃避似的，給黃包車夫拉到店子裏去了。</p>
<p>此地的店子，多是廣東人開設的。華僑在這裏謀生的很多，可惜不懂廣話，不能和他們談一談，他們的生活情形，就只有讓天知道了。</p>
<p>海防的市政，在法帝國主義的治理下，是很不壞的：整齊清潔的柏油路的兩旁，矗立着一排排茂盛的綠樹。白天在火辣辣的烈日下，慢步走在這街上，是使人不會感覺到什麽炎熱的。</p>
<p>海防也同别的都市一樣：有着一個供人游覽的公園。在到海了後的第二天，閑着没有事做，三個年靑人便約着到那裏去玩了一趟。</p>
<p>地方雖是小小的，然而却幽靜得很丨虎哪，豹哪，······都具備得有。幾棵熱帶植物，高高的蔭蔽了天日。紅綠相映的花畦旁邊，是舖着細砂的小徑，懷着一顆好奇的心，唦唦的踏在這路上慢慢的欣賞着，是怪有意思的。</p>
<p>因爲要等船，不能不把日子躭擱下去。每天起來，望着那晴朗的碧空，慢悠悠的白雲，黑鬰鬰的遠樹，思家的心，不禁給這異國的風光勾引起來了。</p>
<p>一天早晨，我含着淚寫了一封短短的信，給遠在天邊的爸爸。告訴他：我已悄悄的遠離開他，跑到這異國來了，請他原諒：我不能在家裏帮助他揑鋤頭，我是一個光明的追求者，我要到海的那遠方去！</p>
<h3>粗布</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>從火山歸來（二）</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>好容易忍着苦痛挨到了一點鐘，因爲風浪太大的緣故，船好像吊在天空中的飛行機，一會從海底　上天空，一會又從天空跳落海底，我和楊都不能睡覺，頭痛得像用鐵錘錘着一般，每人都大吐了一次，我懊悔不該來的。從上海到神戶受的苦痛已經够了，爲什麽還要來受這一次苦呢？眼看得一個個的日本人都睡得呼呼地打鼾，自己却孤零零地站在船尾對着渺茫的海水嘔吐。我這時更加證明了我的人生觀，是的，人生是痛苦的，同時也是矛盾的。明明知道要經過許多困難，許多苦痛才能換得一刹那的快樂，但他却情願拚命地去追求，我不知這是人生的矛盾，還是人生的眞諦？是人智的聰頴，還是他的愚昧？</p>
<p>「到了到了！」</p>
<p>在一片茫茫的黑暗中，忽然發現了像星光般的電光熌爍，這就是大島。我們像從死　得救似的感到愉快，興奮，旅客都站到船邊來，這時風浪更大了，他們又擠進船裏去，但我爲貪看那晨光　徵的海景，竟忘了晨風的侵襲，一雙手早已凍成冰了。</p>
<p>本來船應該停泊在元村的，但爲了風浪太大不能去，只好改泊岡田港，旅館接客的人，每人手提着燈籠，排列在岸上呌着歡迎來賓的　子。可是誰都不願意去旅館休息，只顧匆匆地踏着魚肚色的晨光步上山嶺。</p>
<p>由山岡到山腰可以乘汽車，而且只需三毛錢；但秦先生提議走路可以欣賞風景，於　全體通過。這時有三位帝大的日本學生參加了我們的團體，有一個是秦先生認識的，他是第二次來遊火山，因此正是我們的好嚮導。我們像一羣出　的戰士，精神抖擻地向前飛跑，大家都願意早點達到山頂，看那生平未曾見過的火山，憑弔那些爲愛情自殺的無名勇士。</p>
<p>我們走的是與汽車不同的山路，雖然没有紅葉，靑翠的樹林却像春天一般美麗，鮮紅的茶花到處絢爛地開放着，春天一般的微風呵，溫溫地吹在遊人的臉上，感到一種說不出的舒暢和溫存。</p>
<p>一直走了六里多路，腿子有點發酸，而飢腸轆轆更不能支持了，於是大家在划地上坐下來吃各人帶來的麵包，水果，餅乾。那三位帝大學生究竟比我們有經騐，買了許多罐頭和猪肉，我們都放下自己東西不吃，而吃他們帶來的肉，秦先生（日本人，我們的日文敎授）笑着說：「你們都是肉食動物嗎？」其實他不了解中國人是與日本人不同的，日本人即使有錢的人也很少吃肉，而中國是把肉當做小菜吃的。</p>
<h3>誰能够滿足他們物質上要求？</h3>
<p>— 伯韓</p>
<p>『我們如果要破除那一種精神信仰上的迷信，那除非是從物質上能够滿足他們的要求。誰能够滿足農民對於收穫上的要求，便是誰能够消滅農民的迷信中的「收穫」：誰能够在物質上滿足了市民們安居樂業的可障，便是誰能够在根要上消滅了城市中的迷信。』丨丨這是悟兼先生在十二月三日「自由談」談迷信的結論。</p>
<p>自然，迷信不是用自然科學的通俗講演可以破除的，也不是那種所謂站在社會科學立塲實行搗毁廟宇等皮相的行動所能破除的。「對於迷信，我們最要緊的是要去看出牠物質的根原。」没有人能够使農民多收一點榖子，所以農民要敬土地神；没有人能够使市民安居樂業，所以城市居民要信城隍菩薩。换名話說，所謂物質根源，就是物質上要求的不能滿足，成了迷信的最後原因。</p>
<p>假如人類社會，有一日實現了「人定勝天」，因而物質上的要求能够普遍地合理地滿足，那時候應當根本没有迷信。但是現在談不到整個社會裏「人定勝天」的實現，假使一部分人物質上的要求滿足了就可以破除迷信，那麽，資本家們就不應當有一個相信上帝的，失勢軍閥們就不應當有一個燒香念佛的了。</p>
<p>有時，正是這物質要求的滿足，鞏固了迷信的心理，例如，一個窮人打花會赢了錢或是買航空獎劵得了頭獎，他將歸功於他死去的祖先在冥冥之中的佑助，或者他過去祈禱過的某某神的顯靈。在人類没有普遍地亨受幸福的現在，一部分人物質要求的滿足與不滿足，常常是都可以成爲迷信的原因：因爲，事情不在於滿足不滿足，而在於使人癜滿足或不滿足的原因，對於人們是一種盲目的不能駕馭的超自然的力量。</p>
<p>然而事實上對於大多數人，誰能够滿足他們物質上的要求呢？這在血肉之軀的凡人，以個人力量來擔負，誰也不可能。這只能依靠社會的力量，卽人羣的力量，而不能不包含他們自己。這一點，如果不被他們把握着，而只是祈禱他們以外的任何救主，無論是天上的或人間的神聖，這種心理一天不改變，卽一天不會有自信心從他們的頭腦裏發生，迷信的根本又怎能消滅呢？</p>
<p>所以，講過了「從迷信本身的矛盾上做起」之後，似乎還要在那個結論後面把「誰」與「他們」對立的矛盾解决一下。</p>
<h3>繭（二）</h3>
<p>— （林房原著）靜子譯</p>
<p>還　這樣一回事。</p>
<p>這是當時中學生的壞脾氣之一，商年級生常是欺侮低年級生的。隨便用着一個不成爲理由的理由，常歡喜在無人的草原上，在可憐的犧牲者身上，揮其野蠻的老拳。有一天，我們兩個人照例的在後山散步的時候，不報的被那一羣壞學生抓到了。</p>
<p>其中有一個人丨丨總是那個本地絲廠老關的兒子，名字呌大河的那個留級大王的野蠻貨，慢慢的走近面前。</p>
<p>「啊，是酒井！我看你近來眞神氣！」</p>
<p>酒井半嚮凝視着對方的面孔，决然的開口了：</p>
<p>「怎樣神氣！」</p>
<p>對方突然伸出手來打着他的胸膛。</p>
<p>「你這低年級生，倔强些什麽丨這就呌做神氣！」</p>
<p>他倒在草地上了，但不久又就爬了起來，猛然向着對方的胸膛打去。然而，他的身體太小了，對方又是有三個人，結果終於又被他們打倒在草地上，像小狗似的被他們狂打着。第二次他又爬起來了，這時候他右手握着了一柄光宙閃閃的新鉛筆刀。</p>
<p>對方的嘴唇上立刻消滅了血色，而酒井的兩頰也突然的變成了蒼白色，他緊追在像鼠竄似的大河身後。</p>
<p>對方逃上了丘陵上，這就是以前酒井踏蛇頭的丘陵。路已是到了盡頭，窮鼠之勢的對方，返過身來立着。</p>
<p>「你有本領殺，你就殺一殺看！」</p>
<p>張着虚勢的對方，裝着樣的把上衣脫下在草地上，伸着兩只顫抖着的手臂。</p>
<p>「我就殺！」</p>
<p>酒井的聲音是没精打彩的。寒冷的刀光開始揮裂了空氣。</p>
<p>「啊呀！」</p>
<p>在遠方看着的我，全身的血都凝結了，不期然的呌出了這樣一聲。而大河也就在這時不敵的倒下草地了。</p>
<p>那一羣同伴們，趕去把大河的央子抬起來往前跑，酒井出神似的望着，直望到那羣人在樹林叢中消滅了，他又莫明其妙的倒在草地上不動了。</p>
<p>驚魂回復了的我，趕忙往前跑去，他的顏面掩没在夏草中，他的兩眉在抽動着。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>雜誌年與古書潮</h3>
<p>— 融</p>
<p>如果說今年是雜誌年，那麽在這雜誌年裏，却有一種較特殊的現象，這就是翻印古書的狂熱。先由老資格的商務印書館以大規模翻印四庫全書作爲前導，一時各書店風起雲湧，爭先效法，繼之而起的有中華書局的圖書集成，開明書店的廿五史及書報合作社的廿六史，商務的十通，這都是驚人的工作，其由私人編印者，則也有最近見諸報端的詞話叢編等，被壓倒了多年的古書，近來可謂大走時運了。然而我們一返觀新文化的園地裏，連單行本的創作都凋零得厲害，出版家爭趨於雜誌之一途，雜誌雖多，然而一與翻印的古書相較，其耗費的人力與財力，是小得多麽可憐呢？這是個畸形的發展，而此畸的發展，實有其根深蒂固的社會關係。</p>
<p>簡括地說：我們是不反對接收過去遺產整頓過去遺產的。然而問題是怎樣去做接收與整頓的工作，並且這工作的動機與終極目的究竟是什麽？人類社會的進化，除了個體之生物的遺傳外，還有文化的遺傳，因爲文化是壘積的地進展着，故現代文化絕難與過去文化絕緣。不過所謂接收遺產云者，是說以批判的目光從過去遺產中搜尋出整理出有益於現代文化發展的東西，因爲其出發點與終極目的是在新文化的創化上，故與一般食古不化開倒車的大異其趣。十通，廿五史等方法雖舊，但可幫助我們理解過去的社會，詞話叢編也未嘗不可供給我們研究古代文學批評的資料，這在某種意義上說是非常可喜的。但是現在出版家的心理，是否有意識地如此做却還成個問題。不然的話，爲什麽不惜花費重資來影印幾十本乃至幾百本的「鉅製」，却不肯取出這資本之若干分之一來印刷一些不怎麽容易獲利的却與一般讀者非常有益的小册單行本呢？古書並没有牠獨立存在的價値的，古書只有在促進新書的成長上纔有牠的價値，換句話說，影印古書只是發揚文化的手段而非目的，爲新書而翻印古書，這工作纔有價値。</p>
<p>可是，我們看看年來的新書，單行本已經微乎其微，僅靠雜誌來撑塲面了，難道新著作裏面就没有値得印作單行本的嗎？僅僅把那影印古書的玻璃版省下兩塊，少加些錦上添花的裝璜，省下的錢，不是不足以印行兩本很可一讀的新作品了嗎？出版家並不應純爲「謀利」的目的而生產的。</p>
<p>問題落到讀者的頭上來了，你不願開倒車去做那復古的迷夢，而你求知慾又旺盛非凡，在這環境内，該如何措施纔好呢？茫非斯的金字塔在天明時看來是薔薇光的圓柱，而在殘照中却現着黑三角形的影子，一件事物往往存在着利弊的兩面，只要你肯努力，你就不難從那古書的泥沙中淘篩出燦爛的新知的金粒來！</p>
<h3>蟫蠹之話</h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>每當夕陽西下，帶着一點輕忽的心情走到那南京路上新開的一家法國小書店時，我往往是爲那玻璃窗内五顏六色的美的封面所吸引住了，抽着烟，兩手插在大衣袋内不肯走開，後面車水馬龍</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>的都市街景早已爲我所遺忘，我的幻想是游移於范爾崙和波特來耳的詩境中去了。没有錢，儘對着那一本本的小書出神，卽使在離開的時候，脚步也加倍顯得遲滯，帶着一點依戀與悵惘去回顧那剛剛燃上的霓虹燈光。</p>
<p>我是熱愛看書的，古代的，現代的，中文的，西文的，三十二開本的，十六開本的，綫裝的，皮面的，我都願意蒐羅，只要打開一本新買來的書時，一嗅到那紙的氣息，便帶着一種興奮與感激的心情渴望把牠周覽一遍。只要走到書店，看到那取着種種姿態穿着各色衣裳而斜倚在書架上的書本時，眞想使每一本都移植到我的小書齋裏來，清晨或黃昏，借着陽光的熹微和明燈的輝耀，來狂飲這時代的智慧。</p>
<p>可是，這願望畢竟是很難達到的，這正如希臘神話裏所說的那樣一個人爲神所懲，永遠看得到蘋菓的鮮艷聞得到蘋菓的芬香却不能一快朶頤，這異是一重難忍的處罰，在没錢的時候，有時也到舊書店去玩玩，北四川路，城隍廟，這書鋪正多得很，家家開着門等你進去，僅僅是在這裏面搜求與發現就是一種無法描摹的樂趣，好像走入山陰道中，目不暇給，這邊是一塊靑翠蒼蓊的斷崖，那邊是幾叢山花的綺麗，乃至溪泉，茅舍，只要你有耐性，就不難一一發現，卽使不必滿　而歸，在那翻閱　不是也給你以電影院跳舞塲所不能給的奇趣？</p>
<p>法朗士說：「書是西方的鴉片，牠將要毁滅我們的。」這當然是說讀書入迷因而漫無節制地沉入慢性的自殺，可是選擇與審辨也在我們自己，鴉片有時可充作藥材來用的。一個作者用他的知慧來寫成一本書，這本書被陳列到許多人的書架上，他的名字不斷地被人提起着，他的觀念影響了無數人的觀念，他已不復是他自己，他已與許多讀者的靈魂溶而爲一了。而一個讀者，他是會從那白紙黑字上交結一些益友，窺一窺每個相熟的面影的。</p>
<p>至於我，我喜歡讀些富有滋養性的書，這使我骨格健全，使我肌肉肥胖，因此常把空暇的時間消磨在這上面。一盞茶，一枝和平的捲烟，隨便你船着看或是坐着讀，這回味已經够甘美的了。</p>
<p>如果蟫蠹是會蝕書的，或是愛書才蝕着書的，那我情願作一作蟫蠹，但不是死命地，矻矻不捨地去鑽研的蟫蠹而是一隻能在縹緗中漫游着的，吃着那書又消化了那書的蟫蠹啊！</p>
<h3>冬藏</h3>
<p>— 忘我作</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>冬天，天空迷漫着重霧，拖着一年來疲勞的身體，及那隻飽受了風霜的手提箱向火車站去。</p>
<p>車站上乘客意外的多，背着大包，携着小裏的，大槪都偷得這幾天的假期，回到他們的家裏去。我從人羣中擠出月台，在車廂中佔得一個坐位後，車就蠕蠕地出站了。</p>
<p>自然，車廂中同樣滿擠着人，他們都有着一個疲勞的身體，可是也知道他們心中的喜悅是與我一般的。流浪人能在所謂年底回到他們的家鄕，其歡樂可知丨想到我一星期前，接到孩子學寫的信，就翻着日歷計算歸家的日期，甚至對於工作也偷懶了。本來呢，遠離家鄕六七年，每年年底寫了一封家報就算了，現在那個抱在娘懷中的孩子已能提起筆來寫信要他爸爸回去，想想那寥遠的時日，怎不呌人興奮呢。</p>
<p>昨晚，從賬房的洞口領了雙倍的工資，走出工廠門時，自己好像就是個大財主了。走過熱閙的街市，時被玻璃櫃中的霓虹光迷惑了，我應該替妻剪一套好看的衣料，六七歲的孩子也要買一頂漂亮的帽子。可是注意了牠們標着的價格，却覺得我這雙倍的工資又似乎太渺小了。就從這條熱閙的市街到那一條，在許多許多的玻璃櫃中揀得了我適合的物件。回到住所，謹愼地放進我的手提箱，預料着這禮物將受到意外的欣喜呢。</p>
<p>當我走到家門的時候，孩子一定在門口等候，可是我不認識他，他也不認識我，我就上前去問他的我名字，我可以清楚地從他的小嘴中聽得；「那是我的爸爸。」我就把他抱了起來，吻着他蘋菓般的臉，同時妻聽見了我的聲音，放下牠手中的工作跑到門外來接我。</p>
<p>到了裏面，或者妻特地爲我預備了點心，我就命母子閉眼睛，從手提箱中捧出禮物來。孩子恐怕要偸窺着我的舉動，及至瞧見了那頂漂亮的帽子，跳起身來搶着跑了。妻見了衣料也要像做新娘時一樣的捧着牠到鏡子面前做着身段，她地多久没有穿這般高價的衣料了啊！</p>
<p>想着，想着，剛闔上眼就聽見鷄啼了。而床頭的閙鐘，因昨夜忘了絞緊發條，長短針停留在十二點鐘上。地時候却希望催命符的汔笛聲長長的拉一響來推算時間。但是今天這世界是靜止的，工廠的大門緊閉着，烟突裏没有冒烟，每天那時候起身的同伴恐怕也都在甜夢之中，就是那羣在檐頭啁啾的麻雀亦被重霧驅逐了。如果可以代表這世界的話，就是我這顆興奮的心了。</p>
<p>在車子開動之後，才慢慢的安靜下來，自然，幾少時後我可以擁嬌妻撫愛子一聚天倫之樂了。</p>
<p>我從行提箱中取出麵包來充飢的時候，又把玩了那兩件可愛的禮物，這樣車子送到我故鄕。</p>
<p>踏上故鄕的土地，眼前都是親切的景物，六七年來離别的故鄕我還能生着歸來，我眞是喜歡得流淚了。但是這幾天的歡聚不是一刹那間就要過去的嗎，我們是被生活壓迫的可憐者，好像不應有故鄕，有家庭的，六七年來不就是被生活磨折嗎丨害樣想着時我脚步不由地放慢下來，我怕見我的家門，我理想中的嬌妻愛子不知磨練到如何地步了丨同是人類，爲什麽這樣的不平等呢丨剛才興奮的心，現在彷彿今天重霧似的壓迫着了丨然而家門終於一步近一步就在目前···</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 雪虹</p>
<p>黃昏照例爬進了這軒敞的古厦。</p>
<p>電燈是疏朗朗地掛着，彷彿牠們在靜靜地窺覷什麽似的，諸般不同的姿態是在這裏展開，但簡括一句說：這所古厦裏的氣氛並不因許多個體的活動而失了平和的秩序。</p>
<p>敎師不是因着批改課卷躱在寢室内抽烟捲，便三人一堆四人一堆的坐在床沿上談着什麽無容别人羼入的天；到街上去訪朋或閒逛的，今晚却没有，原因大槪是没有人發起。</p>
<p>先生們的事，學生們不要知道，學生們的事也不要先生們知道，這個好像是每個學生心底所要求着的。事實上，</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>不必要求，但所欲要求的已是實現了的。因爲種種可能的技術足够使敎師無從知道學生們一切樂於幹的該被禁止的事情呢。然而，也許有的敎師明明曉得學生們的某一件事情而裝聾作啞的。</p>
<p>這樣，在明亮和暗黑相接的光度下，適宜於私談的牆隅，有人敢於輕輕地講着秘密的話了。</p>
<p>「我是不怕人家說壞話的，年靑人就不配談戀愛嗎？」</p>
<p>抿着嘴，溜着眼，顯然是一個狂率的孩子口吻。</p>
<p>「誰說年靑人不配談戀愛！」</p>
<p>用兩隻手掌放在他糼稚的同伴頭上，做出得意而愉快的姿勢。人，看來祇十七八歲。</p>
<p>「她的信給我看看！」同伴向他需索。</p>
<p>一張粉紅色的信紙慢慢地珍惜地從那孩子的制服褲袋裏掏出來子。</p>
<p>同伴接了過去，朗然地唸了書首的稱呼。</p>
<p>「怎麽可高聲的讀！」那孩子隨手搶了去，塞入袋内，正經地說，「她眞愛我啦！」</p>
<p>他說她像着了魔，不曉得怎樣抑往那快要衝出心扉的燃燒着的熱情。他又說怎樣痴心的在課室裏凝視着她，把敎師的講述全都糊塗起來，當她不時的回過臉兒向他瞟眼巧笑的時候。他又說怎樣常常想在相當的時機約她痛快地幽會一下。最後，他又說他近來的性情是那樣地煩躁而苦悶。比之那平時看見什麽心愛的玩具或糖果時，判然的有了不同之點，就是玩具或糖果的欲望立刻可以滿足或消滅，現在却是不能馬上辦到，而且像蛇一般的東西盤踞在他的胸中，怪窒塞似的。</p>
<p>「你痛快地招供吧！」靑年針着自己燎熾着的眼覺察了對方情緒的洶湧，同情帶訕笑地說道，「我挺會替你想辦法的，我老王有的是本領！」</p>
<p>見老王手拍着胸膛，知道自己的幸福便在眼前，那孩子勇敢地說了，一點也不遲疑：</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？别胡閙丨我想約她看電影。」</p>
<p>「那祇要再寫封信去。」老王有把握地說。</p>
<p>「我就怕她不肯出來。」</p>
<p>「誰說她不肯出來呢？」第三個聲音突然從背後送來。</p>
<p>兩個年靑人同時回過頭去，一個同學伸着舌頭向從黑暗中走來的訓育主任扮了個鬼臉。</p>
<h3>年關的信號</h3>
<p>— 貝</p>
<p>時光眞過得快，幾度老北風緊急的刮過後，年關就臨近了眉梢。以過去的成規看來，年關前後的一段時間總是很熱閙的，這並不是說官爺們忙着置產業，一般豪富者忙着享樂，南京路上的糖食店顧客擠得水洩不通，舞塲影戲院喧騰達旦，以及一切的歡笑的顫動，而是指的那擾攘葛瓜的一百丨告貸呼聲的普遍啦，討債者的兇逼啦，馬路上剥猪玀的忙碌啦，盜案的疊起啦，以及由這些而引出的悲劇血案啦。</p>
<p>眞的，年關臨了，雖有不少的人在那裏歡呼狂歌，但也有不少的人在這兒哭笑皆非，這是歡笑的一段時間，却也是悲哀的節季。尤其在這種大都會的懷抱裏，一到年關，就只見紛擾，紛擾，第三個還是紛擾。我們的學校也逃不出這種定數，最近的事實，就是很有力的說明。使我忽然意識到，呵，年關到了！</p>
<p>這不算是我的晦氣退財，實在是一種社會的貧窮的反映。然而竤事實的演出，却確使我滿肚子的氣無從發洩，我不曾忽疏過我的防守，平時我總對校工說，近來學校裏時常發生竊案，要留心看管呀。我去辦公之先，也總是仔細又仔細的把窗關好，把門鎖好。旣在這樣「謹防」之下，我的室内的東西，自可不必鰓鰓多慮了，加之我的本性隨便慣了，衣服之類一向是「濫擺一泡」，丢在角落裏，掛在壁上，堆在床上，放眼一看，只見滿屋子都是衣服，其實又並没有幾件，有的都是破舊不堪，毫不中用。最近的過去，才下了一個天大的决心，也右說費盡九牛二虎之力，積蓄一點錢做了兩套西服。因爲一向穿的是破衣舊袴，驟然有了嶄新的衣服，而且是西裝，自然是萬分的珍視。正因爲是這樣，使我厭下了「想穿」的心情，把它兀掁掛在壁上，不時的對它望一望，彷彿就過了穿的癮似的，足够了，那套海林筆篷的西服，我眞還僅穿過二回啦，可說是十足的新啦。</p>
<p>専門照顧我的小賊，眞是眼睛有光，老釘住我，上期竊去了我的皮袍，這又來竊我的西服。我並没有忽疏過，只是我的門鎖不大高明，他就乘我辦公去了，很從容的（我想像他定是很從容的）套開我的門鎖，把我的西服穿走了。</p>
<p>天啦，這眞使我氣急了，西服是嶄新的啦！</p>
<p>然而這並非單是我的晦氣退財，實在是社會的貧窮的反映，至少是上海這種資本主義社會下必有的勾當，至少是現敎育下的學校裏的必有的病狀。年關臨了，偸竊已成了這季候的一般風氣，一星期以來，這裏已同樣發生過竊案多起，有一個同學被竊去了衣服，賊還留</p>

<p>下一個字條給他滿開一次玩笑。這種賊，據說來頭很大，曾經戈獲過一個，審問的結果，而竟是　　大學的學生，嗚呼，大學敎育可以休矣。</p>
<p>年關臨了，這社會的紛擾呵！</p>

<h3>招考推銷員的疑問</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個失業已久了的靑年，曾在紙頭店中，做過三年跑街。最近，在貴報上見有某推銷社招收推銷員的廣告，我便約了一個朋支同去應試。在那裏塡了履歷，並繳了照片，經他們的辦事人員約略的問了幾句，最後，纔回覆我們「將來錄取與否，再由書面通知」的兩句話。</p>
<p>十幾天後，該社果然寄來了一封信：「本社已於十六日開始工作，請於接信後，卽行報到，並隨帶證章費一元。」就是這樣簡單的幾句話。</p>
<p>第二天的早上，我便帶了原信，和我的朋友同去報到。但到了那裏，見報到的人很不少，約有一二百人。而結果他們社裏的人說：「洋鈿先收證章還未做好。」這一點很使人懷疑，而且看他社裏却又一無長物，不過幾張寫字檯子在那裏點綴。因此我没有報到。</p>
<p>編者先生：你晚們職業界靑年的導師，我現在把我的疑惑分爲三點，請你答覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）該社招收推銷員並無限制，以現在失業人數之多，應試的必定很衆，或者他們藉此歛錢，也未可知。</p>
<p>（二）该社無人正式負責，招待應試的都是幾個練習生模樣的靑年，顯見毫無所謂組織。</p>
<p>（三）該社於保單問題非常輕視，全不加以調查。以推銷員負責之重，而不注意及此，更見其有别種用意。</p>
<p>以上三則，實在是我不能解决的疑惑，希望先生破費一個半鐘的時間，賜以指敎，使我不致上當。如認爲必要，並請於報端上發表，使别人也得借鏡，失業人的一塊錢是多麽的重大呀丨親愛的先生：我是在盼望你的答覆丨此祝</p>
<p>撰安　　汪奇珩敬上十一·廿一·</p>
<p>編者按：汪君來信未將該推銷社的名稱及地址註明，似無法調查共眞相；且所述情形，亦不清楚，故編者不能貿然加以判别。不過處此外表繁華，内部黑暗的上海，欺騙的事業極多，稍爲疏忽，卽有受害的危險。汪君因發見該推銷社可疑之點，加以愼重的考慮，理應如此。一般失業者對於一切毫無信用保證，並以收取應　者之金錢爲重的招考機關，均應有仔細之考察，以免上當。</p>
<p>至於該推銷社如認爲汪君所述之情形，有加以補充的必要，可來函聲明。編者當在可能範圍内，代爲宣佈。</p>

<h3>彈詞</h3>
<p>中西（一○四○）十一時三刻至十二時半</p>
<p>開篇「抵制日貨」</p>
<p>扶桑三島大猖狂。顧視耽耽似虎狼。二十一條無理甚。意思要侵吾權利奪吾疆。想前年在九月十八日。遼吉黑三省被佔　强梁。到後來熱河省份又告緊。不數日日人竟敢來　搶。那日人貪心不死氣更張。因此吾民無可忍。共謀抵搞策從長。　輩各處紛紛發。警告同胞努力强。快快要把失地來收復。同聲唱和熱心腸。最可憐呼籲無門實悲傷。因此上要同胞抵制舶來品。絕他商業最爲良。儂是區區愛國心未死。有一芻言請聽詳。便是那持之以恒堅且忍。切休暴動起參商。萬不可五分鐘熱度便成冷。被外人譏笑揶揄愧莫當。更有一椿緊要事。改良國貨貴先倡。要曉得國家致富惟工業。人人要竭盡智能共助襄。得能够出口精良勝日貨。價廉物美共稱揚。來源自絕何消說。使得他有貨難銷起恐慌。失地收復條約毁。同胞有始慶安康。否則是空言抵制呼聲急。反將這國貨振興置一旁。取給無從購西貨。豈非是抵制日貨進西洋。利　仍失脂膏竭。「榜樣朝鮮難免亡。願諸君斯言三復細思量。可慰我寫作此篇長。</p>
<h3>話劇</h3>

<p>中西（一○四○）下午七時一刻至八時</p>
<p>「少奶奶的扇子」</p>
<p>女人走錯了路是不能原諒的，這是少奶奶自己說的，可是她現在在盛怒之下也走錯了路了。事情太凑巧了，子明也會到伯英的旅館裏來，這怎麽辦呢？還是金女士機伶，把帪幔當做了小奶奶的藏身地，可是一把扇子忘了收藏，這眞糟了！</p>
<p>中華（一四○）下午八時一刻至九時</p>
<p>「歡喜寃家」</p>
<p>眞是想不到，吃慣用慣的白桂英，居然會當起家來，而且還是算省得了不得。玉和有了這樣一位賢内助，當然在精神上也可以得到一點安慰了。可是精神上安慰有什麽用呢？房錢總是要的，飯總是要吃的，没有錢怎麽成呢？</p>
<p>李樹德堂（九四○）下午九點至十點</p>
<p>「落霞孤鶩」</p>
<p>馮玉如辭别了落霞，又到陸伯清家中，誰知道陸伯清不在家。玉如没有進去，就回家去了。到了家裏，正看見伙計小張飛與王裁縫頂嘴，聽他的言語，正是在諷刺自巳，氣忿忿的回房去了。</p>

<h3>女子們想做優伶的理由</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>人人想登舞臺或銀幕</p>
<p>天性善於做作及模倣</p>
<p>「天下的女人們，儘管否認好了，但是要是拿顯微鏡來將你們照一照，就可以看出來，你們每一個人的腦筋裏，都存着一個想做優伶的念頭」。以上是美國一位明星所說的話。當然，這種情形在美國，是確切不移的。她們在六七歲的時候，看見了蕭麗鄧波兒，就想自己也做蕭麗鄧波兒。到了十六時，她們或者想做一個萬巴小明星，像派屈里茜里愛麗絲那樣的出風頭。到了二十六歲，她們想做一個　克勞馥或是琪恩哈羅。就是到了五十多歲的時候，梅羅伯蓀亦是她們的好榜樣。至於六十歲以上的，又是從前曼麗特蘭　過了六十歲，還做了電影皇后嗎？在銀幕上，年齡的限制，可以說是絕無而僅有的。</p>
<p>女學生，女售品員，女招待，社交女子，職業女子，家庭女子，她們都具有同一的念頭一想在暖洋洋的水銀燈下，或是燈背後，出一出風頭。表演，内心的裝作，那是天下最難而是辛苦的一椿事，但是她要是决定了想做一個女伶，她就一往無前，没有什麽牲犧困苦，可以阻止她的前進的了。漢倫海絲從八歲起，就登臺表演。直到現在，她的戯劇生涯亦没有停止過。有人問她，爲什麽女人會有那種百折不撓的精神的。漢倫聽了笑道：「爲什麽？爲什麽一點兒大的小女孩子。要跑到樓上没有人的房間裏，尋了一件綢衣服穿上了，裝扮着一位少奶奶呢？這不就是一個女人，天生的具有模仿和扮演的心理的嗎」？但是爲了要扮演，要模倣，她就不怕勞苦，像漢倫海絲在有聲攝影臺上，四面燈頭照耀着，熱得透不出氣來，她還要左一張片子，右一張片子的拍着。那不是太不値得了嗎？但是照漢倫海絲的意思，就光爲裝扮着模倣，已經是够有吸引力的了。</p>
<p>但是蘭可兒杜麗絲，却另有一種見解。她的見解可以拿幾個字來代表的，那就是「銀狐大衣」。蘭可兒杜麗絲說道：「你們大家都知道，银狐皮的大衣，在女子的心目中，是佔着極重要的地位的。好吧，你倘使要穿銀狐皮的大衣，你就要想法子弄錢，而弄錢最好的方法，就是做女伶！金鋼鑽亦是女人們的恩物，她們的弱點。爲了要戴金鋼鑽爲珍飾，亦是除了做女伶，再没有第二條再好的路了」。蘭可兒的話，當然也是一種經騐之談。她從前在格勞　大戲院作女招待的時候，旣没有銀狐皮的大衣，亦没有金鋼鑽的珍飾，但是她生來是個影迷，她所最愛慕的影星，就是格羅麗亞史璜蓀。她心想在格勞蒙大戲院做女招待，是再好没有的地方了，因爲那是好萊塢明星們聚集之所。在領着她們到座位上去的時候，她或者可以用手觸着她們身上披的銀狐大衣，她或者還可以引起人家的注意，因爲她是生得很不差的。果然，她引起了别人的注意，並且得到了銀狐皮的大衣，最近她又嫁了一位百萬富翁，她在可以儘量地購買金鋼鑽了。這不是女子所以要做優伶的原因嗎。</p>
<p>不過有許多女子的想做優伶，並不是可以這樣簡單地用「银狐大衣」或「金鋼鑽」來解釋的。有幾個女伶，家裏本來是很有錢的。有的儘管尋一個有錢的富翁嫁了他，豈不就可以予取予求了嗎？因此卡洛兒郎白就說：「女人的所以要做女伶，是因爲女子們要想自立。做優伶就是她們自立最好的方法了」。你儘管憑藉着你的美色，去哄騙你的丈夫，呌他拿出錢來，替你做新衣服，但是，卡洛兒郎白說：「天下有幾個女子，眞正高興去哄騙男人，呌他們拿出錢來做新衣服的？她們豈不願意自己有錢，自己做新衣服。做優伶就是使女子們經濟獨自之道。她自己有了錢，就不用低首求人了」依照卡洛兒郎白的意思，非但做優伶的女子，可以經濟獨立，就是家庭婦女，亦應當由她們的丈夫，每月給她們薪水，那是她們治理家務所應得的酬勞，使她們自己有經濟獨产的能力，使她們自己有錢買衣服，鞋襪，零用等等，而用不着伸手笑着向她們的丈夫要錢了。</p>
<p>當然，以上所說的還不足以包括女子們，所以要做優伶的全部理由。有的是生來具有做優伶的野心的，有的是用做優伶的捷徑，來吸引男性的。並且做優伶，還有廣義的解釋。有許多野心的女子，雖然她們並不登舞臺，或上銀幕，但是她們却能用做優伶的秘袂，來轟動社會，左右政治。這裏亦就不能一一加以詳解了。</p>

<h3>評「金銀島」</h3>
<p>— 羅平·尤競·凌鶴</p>
<p>TreasureIsiand丨南京丨</p>
<p>接着好幾部文藝電影之後，我們現在又看了這部「金銀島」的演出。</p>
<p>關於「金銀島」這部已經爲世人，丨特别是孩子們所愛讀的小說，就是在中國也用作學校英文課讀本的小說，藉着這次在銀幕上與我們重見的機會，對它能有多一度的認識，與深一層的檢討，當然也是我們頗爲高興的了。</p>
<p>這兒我瘊得有先來槪略地分析作者一下的必要。</p>
<p>洛白脫·魯易司·史梯芬蓀於一八五零年生於愛丁堡，和貧窮與疾病搏鬥了一生，在四十四歲那年以肺病死於遙遠的太平洋中的沙摩亞小島上。他是一個樂天者，在貧病交逼中，他老是勇敢，快樂地生活着，誠如他自己的詩裏所歌詠的「快樂如帝王」似的感着愉快。直到死前還自己撰作了自己的墓誌銘：「在廣大的燦爛的天幕之下，掘個墳來由我睡着。快樂地生，也快樂地死，我帶着一種志願躺下」。</p>
<p>司蒂芬蓀的把人生視作祇是一種游戲，在那裏我們必須玩　很認眞，常是循規蹈矩地希望着勝利，永不失望。</p>
<p>他很有文學才能，運用着寫實主義的地和浪漫主義的手法，（從浪漫主義趨向於寫實主義）很細膩動人的刻畫了各地方，各式各樣的人物的姿態。</p>
<p>他在少年時代就寫着關於聖經上的故事來向同伴們講述。除「金銀島」，「拐子」等被全世界的孩子們所愛的小說之外，有「Mastero　Ballantrae」，「DavidBalfoun」等傳奇與「DrJ　ekyll「andmrhydel」等倫理小說。另有「新天方夜譚，「新新天方夜譚」，「快樂的人們及其他」等三卷短篇小說。</p>
<p>在文學的變演中，史蒂芬蓀和他那個時代的作家比較起來，却是相當落後，在寫實主義已作爲當時文藝之主要的潮流中，他還在寫實典浪漫之間徘徊着。憧憬與反映着史谷德型的作風。只是由於美洲文學的發現，團變了他創作方法的一部分。同樣是空想幻搆的故事，他只用比前一代人更亲奇，潑辣的手法來寫得更有趣味而已。</p>
<p>柯林思能描寫一個無賴漢，聞他們的惡行之處，是這樣地被人格化了的。他們成爲這樣堂皇的特殊的惡人，使讀者不禁會引起一種自然的憐惜。這樣的一個惡漢，便是柯林思「白衣女子」中的福斯科伯爵，史蒂芬蓀的「金銀島」中郎約翰。</p>
<p>很明顯地，從傑姆的身上，我們可以看到史蒂芬蓀氏的主觀的意見：</p>
<p>在貴族丨伯爵與平民丨海盜的關係中間，作者用傑姆這個孩子來傳導了自己的主見。在對貴族者羣維護之外，對於海盜，甚至是惡漢也興趣地賦予人格的同情。傑姆在聽了郎約翰關於海盜生活的回憶與絞死時的悲慘痛苦的叙述之後，感於「同舟之義，與冒險者的敬意，人」道主義地放他逃走了。又如在他「Thesinedemaletroits　oor中所說：「兩小時的生活是兩小時」，而在「金銀島」的最末段在郎約翰臨走時的偷竊金塊上表現了「海盜畢竟是海盜」。「魯濱蓀飄流記」這類的著作意義，主要地在對於殖民地侵略的發動與鼓勵上，「金銀島」是也同樣地担負了這一任務。觀於史穆勒竪起英國旗在荒島上說：「這是英國的土地」，同樣在傑姆嘴裏說出「天祐我皇，」當他拉下大盜之旗幟的時候。又觀於郎約翰臨别時對傑姆說：「你將來會有一個比這更大的船，可以去發現得更多的金銀」等，就是作者指示給像傑姆那樣少年的出路吧。</p>
<p>演出方面說來，「金銀島」和别的文藝影片一樣，只是做到忠實地搬演了原著而已。</p>
<p>一點也不苛刻的說，這裏維克多佛勒銘（Viclorfleimng)在這裏没有放鬆他對於有聲電影手法的任用，但是也没有特别偉大的成功。自然在這影片中，他有着豪放的氣槪，雄偉的律動，以及嚴肅的空氣，這一切未嘗不能威逼着觀衆的情感。然而像「唐吉訶德」或者是「自由萬歲」那般驚天動地的魄力，却是這一影片所缺乏的。</p>
<p>至於個人的演技，那末華納斯此萊，里昂巴里穆亞，賈克古柏，魯意斯東諸人，以前的成績可爲保證。尤其是里昂巴里穆亞在初進酒店的一塲，由於導演之對於空氣的處理，很顯特别優秀。其他因限於篇幅，姑從略。</p>
<h3>評「妒火情燄」</h3>
<p>— 石斧</p>
<p>“TheCrimeDoctor”</p>
<p>丨大上海映</p>
<p>這是一部比較有意義的謀殺偵探案。從劇本一面說，它能别闢蹊徑，具有偵探片的精神，而錯綜着戀愛的哲學。大致是有一個名偵探，因爲他的夫人另愛了别人要和他離婚。他表面是覺悟了情緣，但私心却是妒恨。所以雇了一個女子去暗察他的情敵的舉動。不料這女子將計就計預備要敲他情敵的竹槓。不幸他夫人知道了後又要他去處理這事。他也就借刀殺人竊取了情敵的槍把這女子打死，做成了移禍江東的計劃來害他的情敵。因爲佈置得内行和周密，所以偵查的結果，情敵被判犯罪。更不料他夫人認定情人無罪，託他設法破案，並且答應他如能破案，她也不再嫁了，情願守他以終。可是這可把這位大偵探難住了。他也了悟到情緣終有一定，祇好自首後自殺了。</p>
<p>劇本裏給我們尋味的，這樣一個精細沉着的大偵探，竟會爲了吃醋而不惜犯罪。並且一個女人如果一心一意的愛一個人，便無論你是多大的力量，也不要想挽回。這些雖是理所不必有的事，但是有一於此，都可以造成這部片子的材料，何况全具呢。所以在這劇本裏表面看是很單純，而實際是大有戲可做。</p>
<p>導演的手法是很有經騐，冗蕪的地方極少。尤其是格福特大偵探佈置殺人的幾幕，乾脆了當，並且始終避免被害人的慘狀顯露，這也是超然的地方。對白簡明。法庭上一幕很嚴肅而緊張。演員OttoKruget的表演，鎭靜沉　。兩個女角的選配也得當。滯　沉悶的地方總算没有，不過最無聊的，是結尾一段大團圓，實在有些蛇足。</p>

<h3>重婚（二）</h3>
<p>— 代軸</p>
<p>錢從家鄕滙到上海，一次次地使得文華的更加墮落！他因爲要和交際花香芹結婚，置備戒指等等，打了一個電報回家，要二千塊錢，說是他要做官了，有了二千塊錢，就可以上任了。文華的父親急忙賣去了所有的積榖，押去了田單，凑足兩千塊匯了去。文華接到了騙來的錢，租了一間極富麗華美的房子，和交際花香芹结了婚，雙雙的甜睡在鋼絲床上。一月的光陰逝去，家鄕的父母，在文華甜密的新婚中，異常地焦灼；鄰居們都來問文華幾時上任的消息？老年人的心中，不免暗暗愛慮着：「已經一個多月了，怎麽文華老没有上任的消息啊？」去了信又没有回音，文華的母親焦急的對丈夫說：「你自己去一趟吧！省得又呌人家寫信呀！這倒底是一回什麽事呢？」像一塊沉重的鉛，緊壓在兩老夫妻的心裏。文華的父親，搭火車來上海找文華，找到私立亞東法政學校，然而傳達告訴他，文華已租住在北河南路三十二號。他好容按照地址一路探問着了，一所富麗新奇的洋房，他帶有點兒害怕似的拍着鐵門，裏面閃出一個年輕的女用人來：「你找誰呀？」望着他空的破爛的短褂褲，他連忙接上說：「我找黃文華，我是他的爸爸，有話跟他講。」文華是已經外去了，女用人把他帶去見女主人丨丨交際花香芹，這時她穿了衣服出來，看見了面前的人，出乎她意料之外的穿着破爛的衣裳，便冷冷地吐出一口香烟：「你是文華的爸爸嗎？你住在什麽地方呢？文華出去了還没有回來。」他告訴了香芹住在上海旅館，如果文華回來，請她轉告一聲。</p>
<p>在門口，他遇見了兒子，文華正向這邊走來，見了父親大驚，連忙拖住父親向外走去。香芹在弔樓看見了文華窘急的樣子，她猜疑到文華一定欺編了她，急忙換了旗袍追來上海旅館，在文華父親隔壁開了個房間，從壁縫中偷聽着文華父親的話聲：「你究竟幾時去上任呢，家裏錢也快完了，你的妻……」從這話裏，香芹覺得文華確是欺騙了她，她憤憤的離開上海旅館。夜深，文華滿面悉容的回來，香芹故意笑着問：「今天來的那個鄕下人是誰呀？」文華窘想了一會，又笑着說：「那是我家的用人，他來呌我回去分家。啊，我得告訴你，我要回家鄕一趟哩！」文華歸家來的第二天，香芹就追到這樊川村來，那時許多的鄕人正在祝賀文華做官的喜訊，她走進屋來，碰見了文華的妻子繡鳳看見香芹妖怪一般的服裝急忙問：「你找文華，你到底是文華的什麽人呢？」香芹望了望繡鳳直爽地說：「我是他的妻子，我們在上海結婚的。」繡鳳聽了這話，臉上突然變得慘白：「那麽你受了他的騙了，我是他的妻子，我們已經結婚了快一年了！</p>
<p>二張訴狀在巍嚴的法庭上翻開了：繡鳳控告文華遺棄要求離婚，賠償五千元，香芹控告文華重婚，要賠償損失費一萬。法官問文華：「服麽？」文華慘苦的點了點頭，被關入獄裏，處徒刑一年六月，他慘然回憶起往事，這挽回不及的墮落啊！家庭整正破產；費父親幾十年的汗血的積蓄，兒子讀書出頭的美夢也破碎了！他流着眼淚，悽痛的　躅在田隴上丨丨</p>
<p>樊川村的景緻，依舊和詩一樣的美麗，罩在夕陽的斜照裏。（完）</p>

<h3>President Sun Declares a Two-Week Recess</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 86th meeting on the morning of the 21st, with 76 attendees including Fu Bingchang. President Sun Ke chaired the meeting to discuss the following matters: (1) The Finance Committee of the Yuan reported on the review of the national general budget for ordinary revenue and expenditure for the 23rd year of the Republic, resolving: 1. To pass the original draft of the general budget. 2. The Finance Committee's report on the general budget will be submitted to the Secretariat, which will coordinate with the Finance Committee to organize and formulate opinions within the submitted document for the review of the general budget and submit them to the Central Government for consideration. (2) The Military Affairs Committee of the Yuan reported on the review of the draft grade table for soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, resolving: To pass the review report with revisions. (3) Committee members Huang Youchang, Zhu Hezhong, Liu Jixue, Lü Zhiyi, and Zhang Weihan reported on the organization of the articles and texts of the drafts of the County Autonomy Law, the County Autonomy Implementation Law, the City Autonomy Law, and the City Autonomy Implementation Law. The resolution was to pass the organized articles and texts with revisions. All of the above four laws were passed, with a complete omission of the third reading.

(Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the general meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 21st, the Hunan-Hubei provincial construction bonds and the Qingdao municipal public bonds regulations and capital and interest repayment schedules were passed. The amount of the Hunan construction bond is 10 million yuan, and the purpose is to build roads and repay old bank debts of 60,000 yuan in annual interest. The revenue from deed tax and business tax is the first guarantee, and the business revenue from the roads built with the bond funds is the second guarantee, to be repaid in ten years. The amount of the Hubei construction bond is 6 million yuan, and the purpose is to build roads in the western Hubei region, including Junzhu, Shiba, Shishi, Yi, and southern Hubei connecting with Xiang and Jiangxi provinces, with an annual interest rate of 6%, using business tax revenue and central government subsidies as the fund, to be repaid in twelve years. The Qingdao municipal public bond is 1.5 million yuan, for the construction of shipyards, libraries, expansion of waterworks, promotion of rural social education, addition of vocational schools, and consolidation of debts, with an annual interest rate of 7%, to be repaid in three years. The entire revenue from the increased pier fees after offsetting the fifth pier project costs, and the entire increase in water fees will be the fund for repayment of principal and interest. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 21st, the Legislative Yuan held its 86th meeting. When discussing the county and city autonomy law proposals, Huang Youchang first reported on the process of organizing the text of the articles. The organized articles were read item by item. Except for Article 22, Section 2 of the City Autonomy Law, which was revised according to Shi Shangkuan's proposal to state that the term of both regular and special sessions shall not exceed one month, and all proposals shall be reviewed within the term, the rest passed as revised during the second reading. The chairman then submitted the four proposals, including the County Autonomy Law and its Implementation Law, for a vote with a complete omission of the third reading, which passed unanimously. The County Autonomy Law after the third reading has nine chapters and seventy-seven articles, the County Autonomy Implementation Law has seventeen articles, the City Autonomy Law still has nine chapters and seventy articles, and the City Autonomy Implementation Law still has sixteen articles. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the general meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 21st, the national general budget for the 23rd year of the Republic was reviewed. After a long period of debate, the original proposal was passed. Ma Yinchu first reported on the review process and the documents of the review report, which Chen Changheng and Wei Tingsheng supplemented, advocating for reforms to the customs and salt administration systems. Fu Bingchang stated that customs work is divided into internal and external shifts. If customs tariff rates increase, there will be more smuggling incidents. The original customs officers will not be able to handle the work, and more personnel should be added. If the Finance Committee wants to reduce financial expenses, it should first ask representatives from the Ministry of Finance to explain the current use and reasons for financial expenses, so that both sides can understand the situation and come to an agreement. The chairman stated that the case should not be seen as serious. In the past, when politics was not on track, there was no general budget. The fact that the Audit Department has compiled a budget proposal this year is already a great progress. Military expenses may be flexible from time to time, and whether the final accounts can completely match the budget is still a question. Furthermore, the general budget proposal has been thoroughly discussed and approved by the Central Political Council and sent to the Yuan for review to complete the legislative procedures. If we want to reduce financial expenses now, without first asking the relevant agencies to send personnel to explain, I fear that the annual dispute will have passed, and the review will still not be completed. Therefore, this case can be passed according to the opinion of the Central Political Council. Chen Zhaoying agreed with the chairman's opinion and requested that the Finance Committee's opinion be submitted to the Central Government for consideration. Jiao Yitang also reported on the careful process of the Central Political Council's discussion of the general budget proposal. Wu Shangying stated that the opinions raised by the Finance Committee are not without reason, but reducing expenses requires a considerable period of time to achieve. Therefore, if the Finance Committee wants to have an effect, it can draft a concrete plan and suggest it to the Central Government. This year's general budget can be passed according to the original proposal. Many committee members expressed agreement with Wu's proposal. Liang Hancao and Lin Bin advocated passing according to the original proposal and attaching the Finance Committee's opinion. Fu Bingchang stated that the Finance Committee's opinion has not been approved by the general meeting. The case should be passed according to the original proposal, and the Finance Committee should jointly modify the text with the Secretariat and submit it to the Central Government together. The chairman then put Fu's proposal to a vote. Of the seventy-six people present, fifty-four people approved it, and it was passed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 86th meeting on the morning of the 21st to review the national general budget for the 23rd year of the Republic, resolving to pass it according to the original proposal. The review report of the Yuan's Finance Committee was organized, and a written opinion was drafted and submitted to the Central Government for consideration. According to the review report, the various items listed in the originally proposed general budget were considered generally acceptable. However, the financial expenses accounted for more than 9% of the total expenditure and 45% of the central government's political expenses, which was too large. In particular, the customs and salt taxes expenses were particularly large and should be substantially reduced. The review report listed the reasons, stating briefly: (A) Customs Expenses: 1. The customs tax office expenses in the customs expenses were no more than 26 million yuan in the 18th year of the Republic (including the four northeastern provinces). In the 19th year, it increased to more than 34 million yuan, and in the 20th year, it increased to more than 39 million yuan. This year, excluding the expenses of the customs offices in the four northeastern provinces, it is still more than 32 million yuan, which is an increase of more than 6 million yuan compared with the 18th year, including the expenses of the customs offices in the four northeastern provinces. It has been found that the current customs tax items are simpler than before. After the abolition of likin, the customs tax office no longer needs to handle the affairs of the regular customs within 50 li. The collection expenses should be reduced accordingly. Furthermore, the price index and cost of living index in Shanghai and the three countries of Britain, the United States, and Japan, and the exchange rate index of Shanghai to foreign countries have fallen compared to the 18th year of the Republic, which is not enough to support the increase in expenses. Since the expenses of the four northeastern provinces have been temporarily suspended, assuming that the expenses are reduced by 8 million yuan in accordance with the expenses of the 18th year, only 18 million yuan should be listed. Even if a slight increase in expenses is required due to reasons such as annual salary increases for general staff and exchange loss subsidies for foreign staff, an increase of one-tenth would be sufficient, that is, an increase of one-quarter of the total amount in the 18th year should be more than 22.5 million yuan, which can be reduced by 9.6 million yuan compared with this year's budget. 2. The expenses of the customs supervision office are listed in 29 items this year, totaling more than 716,000 yuan. If the customs supervision office is abolished and merged with the tax office, each customs office will employ three, two, or one secretary, depending on the complexity of the affairs. On average, each customs office will spend about 1,000 yuan per month, and the 29 customs offices will spend about 350,000 yuan per year. Then, the originally listed amount of more than 716,000 yuan can be reduced by half. (B) Salt Affairs Expenses: 1. It has been found that in addition to the general, branch, and sub-offices of the audit office and the tax collection bureau and weighing bureau, there are also salt transport commissioner's office, deputy transport commissioner's office, salt monopoly bureau, marketing bureau, supervision bureau, and inspection bureau. Now that tax collection and salt release are handled by the audit office and weighing bureau, the administrative affairs of the salt administration in recent years have been handled concurrently by the salt areas of the audit agencies, which has saved a lot of expenses. Assuming that this type of overlapping agency is abolished, and a unified agency is established to manage all salt affairs, including the collection of salt taxes, and the salt affairs office is abolished and replaced by a salt administration department, more than 3.4 million yuan can be reduced. In total, the customs and salt expenses can be reduced by more than 13.35 million yuan, etc. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Exchanges Request Reduction of Transaction Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Xin, from the Shanghai Grains Exchange, and Zhu Guangcheng, from the Flour Exchange, came to Beijing on the morning of the 21st to petition the Legislative Yuan to exempt them from the transaction tax and to state their opinions on this tax rate, requesting that the Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan allow representatives from the exchanges to attend the meeting when reviewing this case. According to Gu and Zhu, the high tax rates on grains, cotton yarn, and flour are unbearable. Although the brokers are responsible for collecting half of the tax from each of the buyers and sellers, which does not seem to directly affect the exchange itself, it is inevitable that this tax rate will increase the burden on both buyers and sellers. Grains, flour, and cotton yarn are actual transactions, and the exchange is responsible for regulating the market. If the tax rate is too high and the buyers and sellers do not trade through the exchange, the government's original exchange tax will naturally be affected, and the market will become unstable. Therefore, the exchange hopes that the government will consider the difficulties of the businesses and at least reduce the tax rate, because the transaction tax for grains, flour, and cotton yarn stipulated in the current draft is two to three times higher than that for securities and margin. Gu and Zhu completed their petition on the 21st and returned to Shanghai by night train. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

How to reorganize will be decided after the War Zone Clearance Committee holds a meeting to decide on a plan. The provincial government is unable to bear any additional burdens due to empty coffers. The security team will be reduced to a planned quota of one thousand, otherwise, the province has no funds to pay for it and will have to take it from the local area, heavily burdening the people.

<h3>Thoughts After Reading the Report of the British Industrial Mission</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign dispatch reported that the naval disarmament conference between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan has officially adjourned, indicating that future negotiations will likely occur outside the conference setting. Regarding the Far Eastern issue, which is of global concern, in addition to the development of US-Japan relations, the evolution of UK-Japan relations will be a decisive factor in the Pacific diplomatic landscape. The weight of the UK's position cannot be overstated. After reviewing the report on the Manchuria survey released yesterday by the British Industrial Association, we cannot help but feel certain emotions.</p>
<p>The balance of power among Far Eastern nations has been disrupted since Japan's occupation of the four northeastern provinces of China during the September 18th Incident, coupled with the April 17, 1934 declaration that "other countries cannot interfere." This has inevitably caused alarm among the United Kingdom and the United States, with the United States' attitude towards Japan being particularly pronounced. To this day, US representative Davis still clings to the maintenance of the Nine-Power Treaty (London dispatch on the 20th). It is clear that he is unwilling to completely abandon his ambition in the Far East. The United Kingdom, caught in the middle, faces a more difficult situation. While it has not failed to express sympathy for Davis's position, it cannot avoid engaging with Japan. We can already glimpse the UK's intentions from the previous Lytton Report. The declaration upon the departure of the British inspection team and the report after their return repeatedly stated that their actions were non-official and non-political, only aiming to promote a permanent link between London and Tokyo and to strengthen the spirit of friendship. Their efforts can be imagined. However, the UK's traditional diplomatic approach is also like this.</p>
<p>Some say that the British inspection team's long journey overseas was nothing more than a guise of commercial negotiations to seek political compromise, a kind of diplomatic strategy. Whether this is true, we do not want to speculate at first. However, judging from the general content of this report, it focuses on cooperation and development of "Manchukuo" as the fundamental spirit for enhancing UK-Japan relations. It does not view Japan's policies as erroneous. Although it does not comment on Japan's recent activities in "Man-Meng" (Manchuria and Mongolia), its expression of sympathy towards Japan can be glimpsed. However, we have one point of suspicion regarding this British inspection team's visit to "Manchuria." In terms of UK trade relations with "Manchuria," in 1933, Japan held the top position in trade with "Manchuria," followed by Germany and the United States. However, "Manchuria's" exports to the UK amounted to 9 million "Manchukuo yuan," while imports from the UK were only over 7 million "Manchukuo yuan." "Manchuria" clearly had a trade surplus with the UK. Moreover, since "Manchuria" announced a petroleum monopoly, and recently revised import tariffs, the future development of the "Manchurian" market, from the perspective of the great powers, except for Japan, has become increasingly bleak and is hardly a central focus of the UK's overseas market. Now, looking at its report, although it is cited as a good opportunity for development, considering the guarantee of cooperative principles and the hope for the establishment of a steel agreement, its gains will certainly not be substantial. If such hard work and long-distance inspections only yield such results, is this the best strategy for the British? We believe that, with the UK's intelligence, its intentions must extend beyond this.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Discovers Fascist Terrorist Organization</h3>
<p>Two High-Ranking Officials Suddenly Arrested</p>
<p>Related to the Kirov Assassination Case</p>
<p>Russian Government's Excessive Executions Shock British Labour Party</p>
<p>(London) A correspondent for the Daily Mail in Warsaw cabled today that, according to Moscow radio reports, two former high-ranking Soviet officials have been arrested in connection with the Kirov assassination case. This matter has been confirmed. The two arrested are Zinoviev, former Secretary-General of the Third International, and Kamenev, former Ambassador to Italy. After meeting with Stalin and leaving the Kremlin, Stalin immediately ordered their arrest. Stalin later announced via radio that he would not rest until the opposition party members of these two were completely eliminated. Zinoviev and Kamenev had previously been expelled from Russia twice for opposing Stalin. This arrest occurred on Thursday, and the charges against them are for the murder of Kirov. After describing the arrest, the radio reporter said, "We now at least know who the enemy is." According to another report from the Daily Telegraph's Moscow correspondent, the truth about the recent work stoppages in Russia may come to light after the arrest of Zinoviev and Kamenev. The correspondent also stated that a Fascist terrorist organization has been discovered within the opposition party. Observers believe that this speculation is based on recent editorials published by the Moscow Soviet newspaper Izvestia, one of the most important phrases being "The former opposition in the party has now mutated into counter-revolutionary Fascists." According to reports a few days ago, Zinoviev had regained his former position and been appointed to an important position in the Ministry of Education. (National News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to Warsaw sources, Zinoviev and Kamenev, who both assisted Lenin in creating the Soviet Union, have now been arrested at home. Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied this claim. It is noted that the collapse of the first British Labour government in 1924 was due to a letter from Zinoviev. This letter, disclosed by newspapers, caused the Labour government to lose the trust of the people because it encouraged the British Communist Party to revolt. Kamenev, originally named Rosenfeld, was elected Chairman of the Council of Labour and Defence Administration after Lenin's death. He was later dismissed for joining the opposition party led by Trotsky. The British Labour Party has been quite shocked by the recent executions in Russia. The General Council of the Trades Union Congress and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party have passed a resolution stating that Russia's retaliatory measures involving indiscriminate killings since Kirov's assassination are alarming. Those detained should be allowed to defend themselves in accordance with the law and be given a public trial. A delegation will be appointed to visit the Russian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and the Labour Party's daily newspaper, the Daily Herald, condemns Russia's actions as barbaric and unsuitable for civilized nations.

<h3>Philippine Police Board Russian Cargo Ship and Arrest People</h3>
<p>Twenty-Three People, Including Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Captain Protests to the US and Philippine Governments</p>
<p>Manila: The captain of the Soviet cargo ship "Vokjoniki資號," Mushuv, protested to the US and Philippine governments today because Philippine police boarded the ship and arrested 23 residents of Manila, and non-police forcibly returned Russians to the ship. However, authorities claim that those arrested are Philippine and Chinese communists funded by Moscow. If possible, they will be prosecuted for communist activities.

<h3>British Industrial Association Approves Report</h3>
<p>And Establishes a Committee</p>
<p>(London) The British Industrial Association held an important meeting here today, chaired by Scott, and unanimously approved the report of the Japan-Manchuria survey team. The association also immediately established a standing committee as the first step in UK-Japan business cooperation. The chairman of the committee is Sir Barnby, and the members include Sir Sillyman of the Sillyman Brothers' Bank, British Industrial Association Director Roacock, and British copper and iron industry representative Picator. The committee will discuss economic issues affecting the UK and Japan with a similar committee from the Japan Economic Association, paying particular attention to commercial competition and the development of commerce in "Manchukuo" by the UK and Japan. At the meeting, Sir Barnby presented the report, and other members of the Far East survey team sat quietly on the podium. (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times and the Morning Post today both summarized and published the report of the delegation sent by the British Industrial Federation to inspect "Manchukuo" and added comments. Both newspapers welcomed the view expressed at the end of the report that cooperation between the British and Japanese business communities is necessary. The Times said that reasonable adjustments could benefit both countries, and the Morning Post said that the general atmosphere of goodwill created by this trip was the most valuable result of the inspection team.

<h3>Serious Silver Problem: US Receives Another Document from Russia</h3>
<p>Ambassador Shi Continues to Submit Several Notes</p>
<p>The State Department Immediately Holds Several Meetings</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department is now considering correspondence from China regarding the US government's silver purchasing program. According to Secretary of State Hull today, several more letters have been received from Chinese Ambassador Shi regarding this issue. Reports have also come from Ambassador Bullitt to Russia and Minister Johnson to China, who recently traveled to China. The State Department has also received documents from other sources. Hull did not indicate whether the US government will take any action soon, nor did he disclose the contents of the documents. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials, Minister Johnson to China, and Ambassador Bullitt to Russia have met several times to discuss the impact of the US government's silver plan on the Far East, paying particular attention to the situation in China. Secretary of State Hull declared that they had discussed all aspects of the silver plan and related economic issues. Johnson and Bullitt are both here now, but will soon return to their original posts. When asked whether the Chinese government had recently sent another note to the US government regarding the US silver purchase plan, Hull was evasive but said that they occasionally exchanged views on various economic issues but declined to answer definitively. It is noted that the Chinese Ministry of Finance has sent several notes to the US in the past month, asking it to explain its attitude toward the silver policy and explain the impact of the US silver purchase plan on China. As for the opinions of Senate leaders regarding the policies that should be adopted in the future, they are quite divided. (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the implementation of the silver policy, China's silver reserves have gradually decreased, causing a threat to the financial and economic situation. The Chinese government has recently requested that the US State Department and Treasury Department cooperate to remedy this situation. According to reports, in October of this year, China suggested to the United States that it exchange Chinese silver for US cash in order to gradually adopt the gold standard and avoid rising silver prices, but this was politely refused by the United States.

<h3>US Forms China Economic Inspection Team, to Arrive in Shanghai from New York Early Next Year</h3>
<h3>Dozens of Business Leaders from China and the US are Working to Promote Trade Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>(New York) The US International Trade Association announced today that 15 to 25 US international trade leaders and experts will form a China Economic Survey Team. The team will depart from New York for Shanghai early next year, collect materials in China for at least three months, and then return home to submit a report and propose ways to promote US-China trade. According to International Trade Association President Thomas, the Shanghai US-China Trade Association is assisting in this effort. The Shanghai US-China Trade Association was organized by six Chinese leaders and six US banking and business leaders in the Far East. The list of the survey team has not yet been released. When they go to China, they will lead a large number of secretaries familiar with collecting materials. All organizations are now being handled by the New York US-China Trade Association. The scope, nature, and distance of the journey of previous economic or trade survey groups cannot be compared with the organization of this event. Therefore, international trade experts are paying close attention to the results of the team. If the results are good, similar survey teams may go to other places. The Shanghai US-China Trade Association was established on September 15 of this year and specializes in cooperating with similar organizations in the US to develop US-China trade. The chairman of the association is Zhang Jia'ao, President of the China International Trade Association and General Manager of the Bank of China. The vice chairman is Franklin, Vice Chairman and Accountant of Shanghai Shenchang &amp; Co. Other American members include Hawkins, Chairman of the Power Company, Basseid of Xiangmei Tobacco Company, Schmeyer, Vice President of Chase Bank, Gobert, Deputy Manager of Mobil Oil Company, Potter, Deputy Manager of Da Lai Foreign Company, and Anott, US Commercial Counselor to China, who is an honorary American member. Chinese members include Lin Kanghou, General Director of the Bankers' Association and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Chen Guangfu, General Manager of Shanghai Bank, Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, Guo Bingwen, General Manager of Shanghai Trust Company, Chen Zhezheng, Manager of Yanye Bank, and He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, who is an honorary Chinese member.

<h3>Japan Establishes Diplomatic Inspectors</h3>
<p>Planning to Expand New Markets Abroad</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously appointed Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru as Representative of Foreign Minister Hirota, and sent him to various countries to connect the diplomatic camps at home and abroad. The results were quite effective. In view of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to establish a permanent system of foreign affairs inspectors. Foreign Minister Hirota is now considering specific matters such as personnel selection and inspection areas. The first inspection areas are Southeast Asia, India, Central Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. These are all new markets for Japan's foreign trade, so the mission of the inspectors is also very important. It is heard that Foreign Minister Hirota intends to recommend former Ambassador to Italy Matsushima or former Ambassador to Brazil Hayashi. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>French-Russian Political Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Izvestia newspaper editorial, titled "French-Soviet Political Cooperation," stated: "The Eastern Regional Pact proposed by France and the Soviet Union will guarantee that if any country in Eastern Europe is invaded, mutual assistance will be provided. This is well known. The pact includes Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, and guarantees their integrity to each signatory. This consolidates peace in Eastern Europe and the entire Europe. However, it is well known that some countries have resisted the signing of this pact. Judging from the protocol signed by Litvinov and Laval on December 5, it can be seen that the struggle to conclude this pact cannot end here. In this context, the French and Soviet governments are aware that any attempt to conclude agreements to replace the Eastern Regional Pact or that are contrary to the nature of this pact must be met with opposition. German foreign policy has always completely separated the problem of resolving contradictions in Western Europe from the problem of endangering peace in Eastern Europe. The reason why the aforementioned France and the Soviet Union have this attitude is that France and the Soviet Union deeply know that this kind of policy is extremely dangerous for general peace. Those who want to sacrifice the peace interests of a part of Europe and resolve the contradictions in another part are creating a historical avenue of continuous war, and some countries are constantly referred to as sworn enemies. As for the Soviet attitude, Litvinov has already stated it very clearly in his speech on the 7th of this month, 'It is always willing to establish excellent relations with Germany in all aspects.' The Soviet Union has no motive to isolate Germany while conducting diplomatic cooperation with France. The publication of the French-Soviet protocol has made the world aware of the truth. The protocol first mentions the increase in diplomatic cooperation between the French and Soviet governments, and at the same time, it is necessary to notify each other of proposals that may hinder the conclusion of the aforementioned pact and attempt to consolidate peace. From this point of view, some newspapers hostile to French-Soviet friendship falsely claim that this protocol has a limited and obstructive effect on the struggle to promote French-Soviet relations. It can be seen that this is a baseless rumor. The French and Soviet governments will never form a group in an attempt to deal with other countries. They are only concerned with how to organize peace in a way that benefits all countries. Therefore, they are willing to provide other governments that express their willingness to work for peace with the opportunity to actually join the Eastern Regional Pact to prove that what they say is not false. Only the Eastern Pact can enhance relations between Eastern European countries and remove an obstacle to peace in Western Europe." (TASS dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Unrest on the Russian-Manchu Border</h3>
<p>Boli (Khabarovsk): Several provocative incidents of Manchu forces shooting at Soviet guards occurred in the Soviet-Manchu border area near Hailanpao (Blagoveshchensk) at the end of November and the beginning of December. For example, on November 28, Soviet border guard Korneev, when stationed on the Soviet border 5 kilometers from the village of Bibikovo, was suddenly shot at with rifles by several unidentified people from the Manchu territory. On December 2, a Soviet guard was again shot at by Manchu forces 4 kilometers from Verkny-Hailanpao. The perpetrators fled into the mountains. On December 4, a Soviet guard was shot at by Manchu forces near Sakhalin. The bullets flew over his head. The guard narrowly escaped death due to coincidence under other combined circumstances. The Soviet consul in Sakhalin has now protested to the Manchu negotiators regarding these cross-border incidents. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Puppet State Salt Monopoly</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented After Survey Completed Next Year</p>
<p>(Changchun) "Manchukuo's" salt tax system has so far inherited the system from the old regime, divided into the Salt Affairs Office, which collects salt taxes, and the Jihei Transport Office, which has a monopoly purpose. However, due to the implementation of the new administrative fee system, if the salt affairs system is not reformed, it will only make matters complicated and hinder control. Therefore, the financial authorities are now studying the advantages and disadvantages of the two, and as a result, they may adopt a monopoly system. After the survey is completed, the salt monopoly system may be implemented next year. (Denstu dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee organized by the League of Nations for the Chaco dispute held its final meeting this morning to discuss a letter from the British government.

Among them, the transfer of arms to the ports of Collica in Chile and Montevide in Uruguay was particularly important. The committee decided that if Bolivia and Paraguay still did not provide a satisfactory answer to the recommendations put forward by the League of Nations General Assembly by January 14 next year, corresponding measures should be taken to strictly implement the original arms embargo. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Oslo: The authorities here recently announced that Norway had entered into contracts with foreign countries before the League of Nations Administrative Council passed the ban on arms to the Chaco (May 19 of this year).

<h3>UK and US Actively Develop Aviation</h3>
<p>Planning Regular Airmail Services between the UK, Philippines, and Australia</p>
<p>The Entire Plan to Be Completed Within Two Years</p>
<p>US-Made Giant Aircraft to Fly the Pacific</p>
<p>(London) Under-Secretary of State for Air Sassoon outlined the UK's grand plans for the development of air transport in the Empire in the Lower House today, saying that the plans were drawn up by the Air Ministry in conjunction with various airline companies in the Empire. The main features are threefold: First, the actual improvement of air schedules between certain parts of the Empire. Second, a significant increase in the number of air services. Third, the convenience of first-class mail being delivered by aircraft at the same rate as existing ordinary postage fees. Currently, this matter is purely temporary because the plan depends on the cooperation of governments throughout the Empire. According to this plan, mail to India will take only two days and a bit, East Africa will take two and a half days, South Africa and Singapore will each take three days, and Australia will take seven days. Mail planes will fly to India about four or five times a week, Singapore and East Africa three times each, and South Africa and Australia twice each. The plan also contains a large-scale program for developing the basic organization of air routes throughout the Empire, so that aircraft not only carry mail but also passengers, and not only travel during the day but also fly at night. As for the financial and aircraft type details, he is currently unable to release them as he is still engaged in negotiations with other relevant governments. The date on which this plan will be implemented has not been determined, but it is expected to be fully implemented within two years. There may not be a 3.5 pence postage fee before 1937. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a report in the News, major British aircraft factories have recently partnered with the Air Ministry to build several airships for regular air service between the UK and Canada.

<h3>France's Attitude Towards Naval Issues</h3>
<p>Will It Follow in Japan's Footsteps?</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs and Naval Committees of the Chamber of Deputies are scheduled to hold a joint meeting this afternoon. Foreign Minister Laval and Navy Minister Pietri will both attend and explain the Washington Naval Treaty issue. Now that the London Naval Talks have failed and Japan has decided to announce its abrogation of the treaty, Pietri will submit a report on the attitude that the French government should adopt on this issue. Responsible individuals claim that the French government will also announce the abrogation of the treaty and replace it with a similar treaty. The position it should take in future negotiations will be formally notified to the governments of the UK, US, Italy, and Japan. Japan had requested that France announce the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty at the same time. Although France is dissatisfied with this treaty, it has not taken joint action with Japan.

<p>(London) On the day following the announcement of the postponement of the preliminary naval talks, the chief US delegate, Davis, issued a declaration to the Havas News Agency. This declaration was specifically addressed to French public opinion, stating that the positions of the United States and France were not in conflict.

<h3>US Defense of the Panama Canal Area Strengthened</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Cope with Emergencies</p>
<p>(Washington) Army and Navy officers stated today that the naval and military strength in the Panama Canal area is sufficient to cope with emergencies. They expressed great attention to the claim by the owner of the Panama American magazine, Lance Valls, that the canal zone's defense works were weak. However, they stated that Valls may have overemphasized the possibility of attacks and underestimated the defensive forces that could be quickly concentrated after an order was given. Valls had claimed that "twenty daredevils could blow up the canal," and it would take months to restore navigation. Army officials only admitted that they were powerless to stop two ships loaded with explosives from simultaneously entering the canal from both ends and detonating at the locks. Self-sacrificing aviators could also temporarily disable the locks. However, to prevent this from happening, the Army is currently planning to install huge steel wire nets above the locks as soon as funding is secured. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Germany is Unprepared for Aerial Warfare; Britain Should Not Overthink It</h3>
<p>International Cooperation is Desired</p>
<p>Göring's Remarks to British Reporters</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prussian Prime Minister and Minister of Aviation Göring told a Reuters reporter today that Germany does not have the technical means to carry out aerial attacks. Britain's fear of being harmed by Germany from the sky is an overestimation. The German people yearn for Britain and Germany to maintain a sincere friendship on an equal footing, and this comes purely from nature. He believes that international problems next year can all be resolved peacefully. The German government has no other wish than to seek progress through peace and international cooperation. Göring continued to address the issue of German rearmament, saying that if other countries develop armaments for aerial warfare, Germany should at least be allowed the right to make the necessary preparations to ensure the safety of the German people. However, if other countries are willing to abolish their military aircraft fleets, Germany is also very willing to do the same. Göring then declared that the German people are now behind the National Socialist government and denied rumors of disagreement among cabinet members. Finally, he said that although Germany's economic situation is as serious as anywhere else in the world, it has recently made great progress. This is due to the genius of German scientists and inventors in gradually overcoming the lack of raw materials. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French and German Veterans Strive for Peaceful Cooperation</h3>

In the future, all veterans' organizations in Germany and France plan to hold expanded talks, but this will be based on the principle of not interfering with the current talks.

<h3>Belgian Authorities Explain Franco-Belgian Military Agreement</h3>
<p>In the Event of Trouble in Europe, Belgian Troops Have No Obligation to be Deployed to France</p>
<p>French Troops May Not Pass Through Belgian Territory Unless Requested</p>
<p>Brussels Minister Pouille gave a speech explaining the Franco-Belgian military agreement, stating that Belgium is not subject to any constraints from France. This was considered provocative by political circles. Pouille later stated that it is completely incorrect that, according to the agreement, Belgium would have to participate if Germany and France were to come into conflict, because a military agreement and a military alliance are two different things. The agreement stipulates that French troops may not enter Belgian territory unless requested by Belgium, and Belgian troops have no obligation to be deployed to France. It can only be said that Belgium would automatically join the war if it so chose. Pouille promoted the Franco-Belgian military agreement in 1920, but he was never willing to take the great risk of granting France the right to demand the mobilization of Belgian troops in the event of a Franco-German conflict.

<p>The Hague Grief spread throughout the Dutch East Indies and the Netherlands upon hearing the news of the crash of the plane Uiver.

He only flew to the Netherlands last week to visit his sick mother. Among the deceased crew members, chief pilot Pikman had flown approximately 10,000 hours in his lifetime. Wireless operator Zietelhoef was the only survivor in the 1931 crash of the plane Stork near Bangkok.

<h3>Citroen Automobile Company Declares Liquidation Due to Poor Business</h3>
<p>20,000 People Will Lose Their Jobs as a Result</p>
<p>A Major Impact on the Social Economy</p>
<p>(Paris) Citroen Automobile Company, with a capital of 400 million francs and producing 35 percent of the nation's automobiles, one of France's most important factories, has decided to temporarily close its doors during the Christmas holidays due to financial difficulties. However, it will reopen in the future. Because the factory employs 20,000 workers, and about 50,000 family members depend on it for their livelihood, if they lose their jobs, it will lead to social unrest and trigger economic repercussions in other areas. The House of Representatives still firmly believes that the government should not use public funds to help private businesses, but financial experts believe that the factory cannot be maintained without government guarantees. Furthermore, the factory owes a large amount of taxes, and the government is likely the largest creditor. It is expected that the Citroen company will conduct its own liquidation, reduce capital, reorganize, and then raise new loans. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Seine Provincial Commercial Court, after conducting an investigation into the business situation of the Citroen Automobile Company, has decided to declare liquidation. Labor unions are deeply concerned that if the company closes down and workers lose their jobs, there will be a major impact on society. This morning, Secretary Shih Wu of the General Labor Union led a delegation to visit Labor Minister Jacques, requesting that various measures be taken to avoid laying off workers. Some members of the Orthodox Socialist Party in the House of Representatives plan to raise questions about the Citroen company's liquidation in the afternoon, demanding a government response.

<h3>The Interpretation of Uncertainties in the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and Trial Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case where the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters requested an interpretation of uncertainties in the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and Trial Law, the Judicial Yuan provides the following explanation: (1) Forcibly conscripting people into the military, as there is no explicit provision in the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, should be handled according to Article 318 of the Criminal Law. If there are circumstances under Article 316 of the Criminal Law, that article should be applied for sentencing. (2) Failing to report the full quota constitutes a crime under Article 40 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, without the need for other conditions. (3) Those who intend to re-claim expenses by falsely reporting the number of personnel, regardless of whether the expenses have been claimed or not, should be punished according to Article 45 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law. (4) The "order or command" mentioned in Article 64 of the same law refers to matters pertaining to military affairs, and there is no distinction made between written or verbal forms. As for "resisting orders" or "disobeying commands," both active and passive actions can constitute the offense. (5) The provisions of Article 72 of the same law refer to gatherings of a multitude that engage in violence or coercion, and do not conform to the circumstances of Articles 66 to 71 of the same law. (6) Since Article 77 of the same law does not have provisions for failing to comply, those who steal bombs but do not sell them, or steal them and fail to sell them, should be punished according to Article 85 of the same law. (7) The "fabrication of rumors to mislead the public" mentioned in Article 92 of the same law is limited to matters concerning military affairs. If one verbally impersonates a military officer to solicit military matters, it should be considered as fabricating rumors to mislead the public. (8) Inducing soldiers from other camps to desert and enlisting them into one's own camp should be punished according to Article 163 of the Criminal Law. (9) If soldiers seize property or engage in gang robbery, and Chapter 10 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law has no public rights provisions, public rights should not be deprived. (10) Whether Article 39 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Trial Law has missing text is not within the scope of interpretation and should not be answered. A letter will be sent for reference.

The general closing of the silver and money industry in the capital is following the government's order to be completed by the end of this month. As for the date of the general transfer of funds, because the transactions of commercial firms are mostly settled at the end of the old lunar year, there is no way to raise current funds before the due date. Therefore, the debts and credits of the silver and money industry cannot be collected and transferred until the end of the old lunar year. Therefore, the formal closing is done according to the national calendar, but it is only a formality. The date of the general transfer of funds will still follow the old lunar calendar.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Reforms Grain Payment System</h3>
<p>Starting First with Counties That Have Completed Land Reporting</p>
<p>Tax Collection Offices to Be Established by Local Banks to Handle Payments</p>
<p>Zhenjiang dispatch: The Jiangsu Finance Department, in view of the fact that in the past, the collection of grain taxes in various counties of the province was handled by the county government's grain treasury, and the drawbacks were countless, although strict punishment was imposed once discovered, it was ultimately impossible to completely eliminate them. In order to reform this, it is planned to entrust the collection of grain taxes to local banks. The money will be collected by the banks at tax collection offices established at the local county government, and they will directly handle the payments with the grain households, starting first with counties that have completed land reporting. According to sources from the Finance Department, the implementation of this system has been successful in seven counties, including Wuxian, Changshu, Kunshan, Jiading, Yixing, and Wujiang. In Zhenjiang, it will be implemented in January next year. This is truly a major reform in the tax administration. The tax payment methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>In the preliminary stage of paying taxes, taxpayers should submit their land deeds or old account books to the counter in the collection district to calculate the amount payable. The collection office will fill out a tax payment notice and return it to the taxpayer along with the land deeds. The taxpayer will then take these to the tax collection office to pay the amount. The tax collection office will collect the amount according to the number, fill out a tax receipt, and issue it to the taxpayer as proof of claiming the land deed. The tax collection office will make three copies of the tax receipt: one copy will be kept as a file copy, one copy (blue) will be given to the taxpayer as proof of receipt, and one copy (red) will be sent directly by the tax collection office to the land deed office to be used for verifying the issuance of land deeds. After the land deed office issues the return deed, the blue copy will be attached to the return deed, filed, and kept for future reference. The red copy will be stamped with a "Return Deed Received" seal and sent to the collection office for registration in the account books. If there is an error in the tax calculation, the land deed office, upon discovering it when issuing the land deed, will, if there is an overpayment, fill out a tax refund notice and send it to the collection office for verification and approval, and then take it to the tax collection office to refund the overpaid tax. The original tax receipt will be stamped with a "Tax Refunded" seal. If there is an underpayment, then the tax will be made up and a supplementary tax receipt will be written as proof.</p>

This area is the most abundant area for pear production. The soil in all the pear orchards in both places is pure quartz sand, and the deeper the sand layer, the better the quality of the pears. Therefore, the pears produced in areas with deep sand layers in Lu'erkou, Zhaowangzhuang, and Yejiabo have been valuable fruits since ancient times. People from various countries in the East and West are now competing to buy them, and gourmand nearby also do not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to buy them. Therefore, the reputation of Laiyang pears in the eastern Shandong area is no less than that of the Feitao peach in western Shandong. The following is an estimate of the area and number of plants in each village with more orchards: Lu'erkou 200 mu, 3,000 plants; Dataozhang 300 mu, 4,500 plants; Wu Gezhuang 400 mu, 6,000 plants; Xin Gezhuang 300 mu, 4,500 plants; Yuan Gezhuang 250 mu, 3,750 plants; Lu'ergang 900 mu, 13,500 plants; Zhaowangzhuang 700 mu, 10,500 plants; Yejiabo 300 mu, 4,500 plants; Nanwu 50 mu, 75 plants; Zhou Gezhuang 200 mu, 3,000 plants; Xitaozhang 200 mu, 3,000 plants; other villages 250 mu, 375 plants; totaling 4,050 mu, 60,750 plants.</p>
<p>(2) Types and quality: There are about ten types of Laiyang pears, such as Ren Pear, Fragrant Pear, Qiubai Pear, Western Pear, Horseshoe Yellow Pear, Sour Wo Pear, Sweet Wo Pear, Bald Pear, Jimo Pear, Lada Qiu Pear, White Yuan Pear, etc. However, the names of these types have not been studied by scholars, so there is no basis for them. Therefore, only the names used locally are listed. The quality of Ren Pear is the best, with a production volume of more than 70%. Qiubai Pear, Horseshoe Yellow Pear, and White Yuan Pear are next.</p>
<p>(3) Pruning and fertilization: Pear farmers in Laiyang plant about fifteen trees per mu. The branches and trunks are short and the trees spread out low. The tree shape is quite neat. Every spring, mature trees only have their dead and overgrown branches pruned. From March to April, pit fertilizer (commonly known as pit holes) or manure is applied, with the topsoil being dug up and mixed with it. In winter, they are watered with urine.</p>
<p>(4) Production, price, and sales: 1. Production: Pear trees can bear fruit after seven or eight years of planting. Those that are ten years old grow vigorously and have reached their peak fruiting period. According to the locals, some trees are over seventy or eighty years old, and their maximum yield can reach four to five hundred catties. The average yield per tree is about thirty catties. Calculated at fifteen trees per mu, the annual output is 1,822,500 catties (market catty), at 5 cents per catty, totaling 92,25 yuan. 2. Price: The price of Laiyang pears varies depending on the production area and quality. In terms of Ren Pear, the quality of those produced in Lu'ergang and Zhaowangzhuang is the best, and the price is relatively expensive. At this year's market price (September), each catty costs about 5 to 8 cents. Those produced in other villages cost about 3 to 5 cents. If you choose the complete ones without disease or insect damage, the price is often several times higher than the average ones. 3. Transportation and packaging: Since the production of Laiyang pears is as mentioned above and the price is very expensive, except for those with severe disease and insect damage that cannot be sold externally, the excellent ones are sold exclusively in Yantai. Every autumn, farmers temporarily organize small vendor sales associations (referred to as pear vendors), with each group having seven or eight to a dozen people. The main condition for this type of organization is complete credit. Therefore, they are responsible for transportation and sales separately. The first step in the transaction is to contact the pear orchard, designate several pear trees, and when they are ripe, determine the price according to the yield and market price. The timing of payment depends entirely on the credit of both parties and the need for funds. When transporting, they are placed in wicker baskets, surrounded by straw, with each basket weighing 100 catties, and transported by donkeys and mules. It takes three days to travel from Laiyang to Yantai, a distance of 240 li, and the transportation cost is about 3 to 4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qingzhou Honey Peaches</h3>
<p>(1) Production Area: Hilly areas are abundant, while plains are extremely scarce, with only a few fragmented patches interspersed among the fields. Therefore, the planting area cannot be accurately estimated. The planting region extends from Yunmen Mountain to Sunwangzhuang in the southwest, a distance of approximately 70 li. To the south, it reaches Yanglaoyuan Village, about 20 li away, to the east it goes to the Mi River, and to the west it reaches Guozhuang, about 50 li. The northern boundary only reaches the vicinity of the Jiaoji Railway. The mountainous areas in the southwest produce peaches that are dry, sweet, and crisp, while those in the north are of lower quality. Therefore, the southwest region can be considered the most suitable area for honey peaches.</p>
<p>(2) Production, Price, and Sales: Peach trees bear fruit after being planted for three to four years. Those aged five to ten years have luxuriant branches and reach their peak fruiting period, yielding an average of about 80 to 100 jin per tree. However, due to the extremely irregular planting, it is difficult to estimate the total production at once. The quantity should be no less than tens of thousands of jin. In August and September, many naturally fall and are sold locally at a price of about two to three cents per jin. Those with bright colors and no significant pest damage are transported and sold to Qingdao, Weixian, Boshan, Jinan, Zhoucun, and other places, with Qingdao being the main market. Last year, about 600 baskets, totaling about 60,000 jin, were transported to Qingdao, with an average price of one dime per jin. During transportation, they are placed in bamboo baskets, surrounded by straw and waste paper, and transported by railway. This year, due to severe insect pests, transportation and sales are extremely unsafe. Many merchants regard it as a dangerous path and dare not engage in it. Therefore, wholesale to other places is only through direct sales by the orchard owners, and the quantity is very small.</p>
<h3>Yantai Fruit Products</h3>
<p>(1) Production Area and Acreage: Yantai fruit products are abundant, of excellent quality, and renowned far and wide. However, the production area is not limited to the vicinity of Yantai City. Fruit products from Fushan, Muping, Qixia, Laiyang, and other places are all gathered in Yantai and sold to other places. The production area stretches south to Tiekou in Fushan County (about 90 li) and Wangyan (about 40 li), east to Wangdazi Village in Muping County (about 60 li) and Chujiazhuang (about 35 li), and west to Fushan City, directly reaching Qixia. Within this area, due to differences in soil and customs, the planting of fruit trees also varies slightly. Therefore, east of Yantai, grapes are mainly produced. To the west of Muping, pears of the Xiangjiao variety, apples, and Western pears are produced. In the south-central area, rose-scented grapes, pears of the Xiangjiao variety, cherries, and crabapples are mainly produced. In the Wangyan and Tiekou areas, pears of the Xiangjiao variety and Qiu Huapi apples are the most common. To the west, in Qixia, Laiyang pears, Xiangshui pears, pears of the Xiangjiao variety, hawthorns, persimmons, apricots, peaches, and various Chinese cherries are produced. The largest grape orchards are the east and west gardens of Zhang Rong Company, covering an area of about 1,000 mu, with an annual output of 100,000 jin and more than 60 varieties. According to statistics, the area occupied by various fruit orchards, except for a few planted in the plains, is mostly hilly or terraced land, about 150 li from east to west, and scattered in fragments on the hills from north to south. The area cannot be estimated. The largest apple orchard is the Puyuan Orchard in Xishawang, Yantai (founded by Li Zaizhi), covering an area of 150 mu, of which about 90 mu are planted with Xiangjiao, Qiu Huapi, and sweet apples. The trees are vigorous and are at their peak fruiting period.</p>
<p>(2) Types and Quality: There are about a dozen kinds of Yantai fruit products, such as Western pears,</p>
<p>M茄 pears, sweet water pears, Chinese pears, apple varieties such as Xiangjiao, Hongkui, Jinxing Luqing, Qiu Huapi, Fu Huapi, Renqingpi, Baisha Mi, and Pound apples, Chinese apples, sweet apples, crabapple varieties such as Da Haitang, Xiao Haitang, Bai Haitang, grape varieties such as Rose Xiang, Longan, Zhunai, Sweetwater, cherry varieties such as Red Cherry, Yellow Cherry, Black Cherry, and Chinese Cherry, etc. The quality varies slightly depending on the soil and management methods, but Western pears, pears of the Xiangjiao variety, apples, rose-scented grapes, and cherries are the best. The breadth of sales and the height of prices are also the highest. The next best are Qiu Huapi and Fu Huapi apples, and crabapples. (3) Pruning and Fertilization: In the fruit orchards of Yantai, the row and plant spacing for pears, apples, and cherries ranges from one zhang to one zhang five chi. Cup-shaped pruning is mostly used, with short trunks and even distribution of branches. Grapes are pruned horizontally, and the trellises are very simple. Mature fruit trees are pruned of overly dense and dead branches in the spring and autumn seasons. Manure is applied once in March and April, scattered on the ground, and mixed by digging up the topsoil. Urine is poured in winter. In the Zhipu Garden of Xishawang, fish fertilizer is applied in autumn, four to six jin per tree. The amount and quantity of fertilizer applied vary from person to person. Those with more difficult economic conditions may not fertilize, or it is not regular.</p>
<p>(4) Production, Price, and Sales: The annual production of Yantai fruit products is difficult to accurately estimate due to the vast area and distribution throughout Fushan, Laiyang, Muping, and Qixia. As for fruit products, apples are the most common, with pears of the Xiangjiao variety accounting for about 20%, Fu Huapi and Qiu Huapi accounting for about 50%, and Chinese apples accounting for about 10%. Next are Western pears and Chinese pears, accounting for about 10%. Da Qingpi, Baisha Mi, crabapples, grapes, etc., account for about 10%. In recent years, due to soil, climate, and transportation conditions, the fruit orchard industry has expanded, and the fruit production should gradually increase. However, due to sudden climate changes and increased pests and diseases, the number has decreased. The export volume from the 20th to the 22nd years is briefly described below: (1) Shanghai: 10,810,676 jin in the 21st year, and 7,510,275 jin in the 22nd year (sales to Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Hangzhou are also included in this number). (2) Tianjin: 10,388,871 jin in the 21st year, and 667,147 jin in the 22nd year (sales to Peiping are also included in this number). (3) Dalian: 3,164,011 jin in the 21st year, and 5,153,895 jin in the 22nd year. (4) Hong Kong: 1,375,560 jin in the 21st year, and 701,349 jin in the 22nd year. (5) Andong: 1,217,113 jin in the 21st year, and 549,811 jin in the 22nd year. The total is 1,000,002 jin in the 20th year, 17,606,235 jin in the 21st year, and 14,582,488 jin in the 22nd year. The above are the numbers reported by fruit companies to the customs. It is said that about half of each export is not declared for customs duties, because reporting to the customs delays the import and export time, and the fruit products are easily damaged, so it is better to smuggle them and sell them quickly. Based on this calculation, the total export volume of Yantai is not just this number. Also, the export is mainly Qiu Huapi apples, followed by Chinese pears and cherries.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Xingji Silk Factory Went Bankrupt</p>
<p>The Jiuyu Silk Factory under Kuatang Bridge outside Nanmen had ceased operations for a long time due to the disastrous decline in the silk market and the failure of its operations. In June of this year, villagers such as Ji Yunchu raised funds to continue operations and changed the brand name to Xingji. Recently, Ji Yunchu suddenly absconded to Shanghai with more than 4,000 yuan of silk funds, causing the factory to be unable to make ends meet. Three or forty villagers came to the factory the other day to demand payment for silkworm cocoons. Because Ji avoided coming to the factory, a dispute arose. The female workers and staff in the factory were also concerned that they would not be paid the more than 4,000 yuan owed to them in wages, so they specially elected Shi Wenhui and others as representatives to demand payment from the accounting office. The factory was surrounded on all sides, with no way to maintain operations, and had to announce a shutdown starting yesterday. Now all the employees are increasingly panicked and are prepared to detain the factory's silk. The villagers demanding payment for cocoons are still gathered in the factory and plan to drag the person in charge to the government for assistance.</p>
<h3>Bandits Accumulated in Suzhou Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Xu Songbo, a patrol officer from the Fifth Police Station of the Third Public Security Bureau of Suzhou, intercepted two stolen boats in the river under Wangmiao Bridge in the county at about 8 p.m. the night before yesterday and detained six robbers, including Wang Youfu, Qi Laoliu, and Qi Xiaoyang. They confessed that their accomplices, Chen Rongsheng, Wang Liansheng, and Zhu Changfu, were hiding in Wuxi. Patrol Officer Xu then obtained approval from his superiors, came to Wuxi with police documents yesterday, and, together with the Fourth and Fifth Police Bureaus of this county, dispatched police to arrest Chen Rongsheng and Wang Liansheng in a thatched shed near the Third Marine Police Detachment east of Wu Bridge and in a thatched shed near the Maoxin Second Factory. It is reported that Chen and others are all long-time bandits from Taihu Lake and will be sent to Suzhou for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Dredging of the River Beach Will Begin Soon</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang River Beach Dredging Committee, since jointly designing the dredging of the Zhenjiang River Beach with the Zhenjiang County Construction Bureau, has been planning for many years. All of the first phase of the project, from Pingzheng Bridge to the Puji Wharf and to Zhenjiang Pass, has been designed. Afterwards, due to the time being the tide season, it was inconvenient to construct. Now the committee and others believe that the water has receded during the winter season, and construction should begin in a timely manner to harmonize shipping. Therefore, starting today, bidding will begin, and the bids will be opened to the public in the auditorium of the County Government on the 25th. It is also reported that the committee has completed the design of the second phase of the project, which extends from Zhenjiang Pass to Xiaomatou. The design and surveying of the third phase of the project below Xiaomatou will begin now. Once the first phase of the project is completed, bidding and construction will continue.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Investigate and Prohibit the Supply of Grain and Grass to Sea Bandits</p>
<p>The coastal area of ​​Jiangbei Tong is disturbed by large groups of sea bandits. Although the seaports have been blocked by military police, the bandits still use shallow waters to coerce the people to supply grain and grass. The Fourth District Security Command is now planning to thoroughly eliminate them. Under this rampant situation, on the one hand, it first ordered the troops stationed along the coast to strictly block them, and on the other hand, it strictly prohibited the people from supplying food, firewood, and grass to the bandit ships, so that the bandits would have nothing to gain.</p>
<h3>City and Countryside Hold General Cleaning</h3>
<p>Nantong County, both urban and rural areas, held a general cleaning on the 21st. In the city, Zheng Yitong, head of the Youth Service Corps, led 20 large teams to clean the streets by district. This cleaning campaign abandoned the parade system and adopted implementation.</p>

<h3>President Wang Resolutely Denies Centralizing Cash</h3>
<p>The Economy Is Indeed in a Difficult Time</p>
<p>The Government Will Do Its Best to Remedy It</p>
<p>Hopes that the United States Will Not Purchase Silver Too Quickly</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, there have been various speculations and rumors recently that the government will centralize cash and implement non-convertible paper money. President Wang happened to come to Shanghai yesterday, and the reporter made a special visit. He replied as follows: President Wang said that various rumors are nothing more than speculators creating an atmosphere, or people who do not understand the financial situation unnecessarily worrying. Most of China's silver is scattered in the hands of the people. Even if the government is willing to centralize it or reduce its fineness, what benefits would the government have? Moreover, this policy completely violates the interests of the country and the people. Therefore, no matter what, the government will never adopt it. As for the current economic problems in China, they are indeed in a difficult time. The government will do its best to remedy it. Minister Kong has recently been working hard to reduce expenditures, increase tariffs, reduce unnecessary imports, and improve agriculture, etc., which are fundamental plans. President Wang finally stated that he deeply hoped that the United States government would take into account the difficulties China is encountering when carrying out its silver purchase policy, not proceed too quickly, and hoped that it could find ways to reduce or eliminate China's current difficulties.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Railway Department, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning for Dr. Noel to examine his diabetes and to visit Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, and Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy. In the afternoon, he met with Dr. Wang Chonghui, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, and received Zhang Gongquan from the banking community. He returned to Beijing by night train last night. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Activities in Shanghai: Mr. Wang, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, took the Beijing-Shanghai night train from Beijing at 11 p.m. the night before last and arrived in Shanghai at about 7 a.m. yesterday. He got off the train at Nanxiang Station, and immediately changed to a car and returned to his residence to rest. At about 9 a.m., Mr. Wang telegraphed Dr. Noel to come and examine his body, which did not finish until 9:30 a.m. Then, Jiang Fu accompanied Zeng Zhongming to visit Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, and Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, and returned at noon. According to Mr. Zeng Zhongming, Mr. Wang's visit this time was not for any special mission, but to examine his body and visit the two ministers Gu and Chen. According to the doctor's report, the examination results were the same as usual, without much change. In addition to meeting with Wang Chonghui and Finance Minister Kong at about 7 p.m. last night, Mr. Wang also received Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, at 4:15 p.m. yesterday, and talked for about 40 minutes. Mr. Zhang then left at 5 p.m. sharp.</p>
<p>Unity Issue: Mr. Wang said to visitors yesterday that since Qu Fangpu, Director of the Finance Department of Guangdong, came north, he has actually felt that the central government and the two sides of Guangdong and Guangxi are becoming closer. When Qu arrived in Beijing, he also brought a letter from Chen Bonan to me, expressing his extreme support for the telegraph and advocating a determination to suppress bandits. As for Mr. Hu Zhantang coming north, there is this possibility, but the date of the trip is unknown. The matters advocated by the telegraph, after being passed by the Fifth Plenary Session, are now being reviewed by the Central Political Committee and will have detailed regulations in the future.</p>
<p>Gu and Chen Have Recovered: Mr. Wang also said that he had visited the two ministers Gu and Chen this morning. Mr. Gu's illness has largely recovered, and he can return to Beijing after a short rest. Mr. Chen has no serious illness, but his vacation has not yet expired. It is expected that he will return to Beijing in about two weeks. Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China came to visit regarding financial matters and specially discussed a way to stabilize the financial situation in response to recent rumors. Mr. Wang, after finishing his business in Shanghai, took the 11 p.m. Beijing-Shanghai night express train with an attached flower car with his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Deputy Minister Zeng Zhongming of the Ministry of Railways, and left Shanghai to return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance and the Banking Community Negotiate to Stabilize Financial Measures</h3>
<p>Tax Reduction on Silver Exported and Stored by Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Have Sufficient Currency Reserves</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the collection of export taxes on silver to prevent large outflows, although it has been effective, domestic finance has not been completely stable. The Ministry of Finance has again negotiated with the banking community in this city on measures to stabilize domestic finance. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reasons for Unease: According to Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association, the sharp reduction in the reserves of banks in this port is an undeniable fact. However, upon investigation, the banks with sharply reduced reserves are all foreign banks. The reserves of Chinese banks are very sufficient and have not decreased in any way. The reason is that Chinese banks follow the government's orders and do not export silver, as evidenced by their current reserve figures. As for the recent reasons for financial unease, they are actually due to speculators creating rumors and the public not understanding the truth, which has led to silver hoarding. The upcoming New Year and tight credit conditions are also normal phenomena and are not surprising.</p>
<p>Negotiated Appropriate Policies: In recent years, the silver and money industry in this city has been affected by the economic downturn in society, industry, and commerce. It feels that there are thorns everywhere for those without concrete guarantees and credit relationships, and there is nowhere to lend money. Industry and commerce also feel that the market is sluggish, business is depressed, and it is difficult to gain the trust of the silver and money industry, making it difficult to borrow money to adjust finances. Therefore, the social economy is showing signs of exhaustion, which has caused general panic. In order to remedy and stabilize the financial situation, the Ministry of Finance is now holding informal consultations with the leaders of the banking community here to find relief measures, hoping to work together to develop appropriate policies that will provide concrete guarantees for the country's finances so that they can be stabilized as soon as possible to reassure society.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Are Well-Funded: According to the China News Agency, since the United States purchased large amounts of silver, there have been rumors that a large amount of silver has flowed out of the city. However, according to the results of the investigation, the reserves of Chinese banks have not decreased, and the reserve funds for the banknotes they issue are very sufficient. The so-called sharply reduced reserves of banks are all foreign banks, and the export of silver is a natural phenomenon and has no significant relationship with the domestic banking community. A reporter from the China News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that the amount of banknotes issued by Chinese banks and their reserve funds up to November are very detailed. The details are listed in the table below (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Bank Amount of Banknotes Issued Cash Reserve Amount Guarantee Reserve Amount</p>
<p>China 136,298,035 76,580,353 44,022,686</p>
<p>Central 85,746,535 68,574,535 17,678,000</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Optimistic About the Prospects for Cooperation, Currently Negotiating Methods</p>
<p>Reported on the Trip's Progress to Wang and Kong Last Night</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, had previously traveled south twice to meet with Hu, Chen, and others to discuss sincere unity. He returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the President Cleveland ship from Hong Kong with Sun Danlin. He met with Wang Jingwei, Kong Xiangxi, and others in the evening. Mr. Wang expressed optimism about the prospects for cooperation. Whether or not Hu Hanmin comes north is not important. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel: Those who went to welcome him on the ship yesterday included Central Committee member Deng Qingyang, Yang Dezhao representing Chen Jitang, former President of the High Court Lin Biao, President of the Faculty of Law and Politics Wei Daoming, Appraiser Wang Huaichen from the Department of Judicial Administration, Mr. Wang's friends Tan Haiqiu, Secretary Xiao Jinfang, Zhu Yongshou (who previously accompanied Wang on his trip south and returned a few days ago), former Dutch Charge d'Affaires Dai Mingfu, Sun Danlin's secretary Yang Kenwang, and Chen Jilie and many others.</p>
<p>Arrival: The President Cleveland ship entered the port at about 11 a.m. and did not enter the Huangpu River until 12:30 p.m., docking between the 12th and 13th floating pontoons on the Jiangmian Yangshupu. The dignitaries all took a ferry from the Xinguang Pier to welcome him on the ship at 12 p.m. They boarded the ship at 1 p.m. and met with Mr. Wang. After a brief greeting, they changed to a ferry at 2 p.m. and landed at the Xinguang Pier, and then went to the Dongya Restaurant for lunch with Wei Daoming and others.</p>
<p>Method is Important: Mr. Wang said to the press corps on the ship yesterday that, in addition to having considerable talks with the Southwest Committees in Guangdong, the most opportunities were when he met with Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong. Mr. Hu and I spent several days together. Mr. Hu believes that the issue of coming north is not the key. The most important thing is the method of cooperation. If the method is negotiated, then coming north will naturally not be a problem.</p>
<p>Accepting Principles: Mr. Wang also said that there should be three steps on both sides. The first step is to eliminate suspicion between the two sides. The second step is to seek sincere understanding between the two sides. The third step is to talk about cooperation.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Chonghui Returns to Shanghai (Photo by Zhu Shunlin)</h3>
<p>The first and second steps have been completed, and the third step is now underway, which is negotiating the method of cooperation. From my personal observation, cooperation is indeed possible. The opinions put forward by Mr. Hu have been accepted by the central government in principle. What remains to be discussed is only the detailed method.</p>
<p>Leaving the Country at the Beginning of the Month: My trip abroad will likely take place at the beginning of next month, as the Hague vacation expires at the end of next month. It is not true that I will stay in Beijing to take up a post. After meeting with President Wang and Finance Minister Kong in Shanghai, I also plan to visit Chairman Jiang. According to Sun Danlin, who came with me, Mr. Hu is in very good health and his blood pressure is not high. He will probably come to Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Meeting with Wang and Kong: Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi originally planned to prepare lunch at his home after Mr. Wang arrived in Shanghai and invite him to meet, but he stopped because Mr. Wang arrived in Shanghai too late. At about 7 p.m. last night, Mr. Wang met with President Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi at Kong's residence, and they dispersed after a long time.</p>
<h3>Qu Fangpu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Qu Fangpu, Director of the Finance Department of Guangdong Province, accompanied by Wen Zhongqi of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, and He Shaozhen, Section Chief of the Finance Department, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong on the 16th, paid respects to Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, and entered Beijing on the 18th to pay respects to Chairman Lin, President Wang, and others, reporting on the political situation in Guangdong Province. Now that he has completed his public duties, he arrived in Shanghai at 7:20 a.m. yesterday by night express train from Beijing. According to Mr. Qu, who was interviewed by a reporter from the Central News Agency at the station, after arriving in Shanghai on this trip north, he met Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and reported on the financial income of Guangdong Province. After arriving in Beijing, he successively paid respects to Chairman Lin and President Wang, reporting on the finances of Guangdong Province and the suppression of bandits. As for the national sincere unity issue, the future is very optimistic. Mr. Qu also said that the central government and the southwest have always been very harmonious.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Companies Held a Winter Prevention Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decided to Increase Escort Police and Implement Inspections</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Companies held a winter prevention meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road at 2 p.m. yesterday. The attendees were the representatives of Sanbei Shipping Company, Ningshao Commercial Shipping Company, Pingan Shipping Bureau, Daxing Commercial Shipping Company, Dada Shipping Company, Datong Renji Shipping Company, Huxing Commercial Shipping Company, Ruian Commercial Shipping Company, Lianan Shipping Bureau, Jufeng Shipping Company, and Maoli Commercial Shipping Bureau, such as Chen Yisheng and Luo Lianchen. Yang Youlong, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, attended the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the rampant piracy along China's coast and the frequent occurrence of merchant ships being robbed. In order to prevent this, following the old practice of last winter, a winter prevention meeting was held to jointly devise concrete measures. Decisive measures were taken on how to increase police escorts, how to send police to inspect, and anti-theft equipment. However, due to the fact that it concerns anti-theft, it is not convenient to publish it. However, according to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, the expenses will be borne separately by the companies, and short-term escort police will be hired to patrol the docks. Passengers will be inspected before the ships set sail to prevent bandits from mixing in.</p>
<h3>China Merchants' Haiheng Ship Went to Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Haiheng: After its maiden voyage to Qingdao, Haizhou, etc., and returning to Shanghai, it docked at Jinliyuan Wharf, loaded with cargo waiting to sail. It cleared customs the night before last and officially sailed to Guangdong, Shantou, and other ports at 1 p.m. yesterday. It was loaded with 32,000 packages, totaling more than 2,900 items, of transshipment cargo from Qingdao and this port to Guangdong, Shantou, and other ports, such as cotton yarn, cloth, groceries, matches, and stalks. It also carried many passengers.</p>
<p>Haili: After being completed and sailing here, it inspected the machinery in the No. 3 dock of the Jiangnan Shipyard.

As for the Haizhen, according to the wireless message received by the Marconni Company, the ship will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Songhu District Pilotage Dispute</h3>
<p>Permission Granted for Re-examination of Previously Failed Pilots</p>
<p>Reduced Pilotage Rates for Vessels with Drafts Exceeding 18 Feet</p>
<p>Following the establishment of the Shanghai Pilotage Administration Committee, the pilotage dispute in the Songhu District has been resolved. The Committee has now granted permission for re-examination of pilots who previously failed. Pilotage rates for vessels with drafts exceeding 18 feet will be reduced. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Permission for Re-examination: Pilots in the Songhu District who failed previous examinations or did not participate in the examinations organized a petition group and appealed to government authorities. The Pilotage Administration Committee has now granted permission for re-examination. As for pilots who failed the vision test, they will be given severance pay. The Shanghai Shipping Association will send representatives to oversee the re-examinations. The Association originally appointed Jia Dingxi, the owner of Changxing Steamship Company under the Sanbei Company, but because Mr. Jia serves on ships and travels不定, Chen Ganqing of the China Ship Insurance Association has now been appointed instead.</p>
<p>Committee Announcement: Shanghai Pilotage Administration Committee Announcement No. 5 states: For notification purposes, the Committee is currently holding pilot re-examinations. All Songhu short-term pilots whose qualifications were examined by the Committee in July, August, and September of this year and did not pass, except for those who failed the physical or vision tests, must register at the Committee's Songhu District Pilotage Office on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs immediately to await re-examination. Do not delay or neglect this, lest you err. This announcement is dated December 20, 1934, and signed by Chairman Kanai'er.</p>
<p>Reduced Rates: The pilotage rates for short-term employed pilots in the Songhu District, after being established and announced by the Pilotage Administration Committee, sparked opposition from shipping merchants, leading to a shipping strike. Subsequently, after negotiations between shipping leaders Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, and Committee Chairman Kanai'er and Customs Superintendent Shen Shuyu, the Committee agreed to reduce rates for vessels with drafts exceeding 18 feet. Initially, shipping merchants still expressed opposition, but after mediation by shipping leaders, the issue has largely been resolved.</p>
<p>Strict Enforcement: The Shanghai Pilotage Administration Committee has resolved to strictly enforce the Provisional Pilotage Administration Regulations. In addition to the announcement, all relevant shipping companies are notified to comply. Anyone found to be piloting without a valid license will be prosecuted for endangering public safety and handed over to the local court for punishment. Any vessel found to employ a person without a valid license as a pilot will be fined 150 yuan in national currency.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Formulates Application Procedures for Facilitating the Circulation of National Currency</h3>
<p>Entrusting the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to Handle</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Circular was Issued to Chambers of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industries for Information</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a circular to the City Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industries Association yesterday, stating: In order to maintain the normal flow of finance in various regions and to facilitate commercial needs, especially during the current harvest season, merchants in various ports purchasing goods from the interior require a large amount of cash. To meet the needs of the interior, this Ministry has been issuing national currency escorts for domestic transport to various regions upon request from various banks, providing maximum convenience. However, in case of urgent needs where commercial banks cannot report in time, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications should act as agents for remittances or transport of cash to facilitate and regulate. This matter has been discussed by the Ministry and the three banks have agreed to handle it. The three banks have replied that they have jointly formulated the consignment application form and agency transport procedures and sent them to the Shanghai Banking Association for distribution to commercial banks and to the branches of the three banks for distribution to local associations or commercial banks for compliance. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the Association for distribution to all merchants for information. This order is issued.</p>
<h3>Shen Jinding Scheduled to Take Office</h3>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Request for Interpretation of Foreign Merchants' Responsibility to Affix Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>Please Provide Instructions on Remedial Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 20th of this month, we received a letter from the Egg Industry Association stating that since the current Stamp Duty Regulations and Penalties were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, all Chinese citizens within the city have been able to comply strictly. However, it is feared that foreign merchants may not be fully compliant. If a Chinese citizen purchases goods from a foreign merchant and the invoice or order form issued by the foreign merchant has not been stamped, should the invoice be penalized if it is discovered by the authorities in the possession of the consignee? If penalties are to be imposed, should they be imposed on the seller or the buyer? This is request for interpretation point one. Sometimes a Chinese citizen places an order with a foreign firm and pays a deposit. The foreign firm issues an order form, but the order form is not stamped. In the event that the price of goods rises or falls by the deadline, the foreign firm may not fulfill the original agreement, which will inevitably lead to disputes or even litigation. At that time, will the court recognize the unstamped order as valid in law? This is request for interpretation point two. The above two points are of vital interest to all industries in this city that have dealings with foreign merchants. They have sent letters to the Association requesting investigation and interpretation, which is a public sentiment. The responsibility for affixing stamp duty lies with the issuer of the document. This is the usual legal principle. In the past, except for passports and licenses issued by government offices, where the recipient paid the fees for affixing the stamps, the responsibility for affixing the stamps was borne by the issuer of the document. Therefore, if foreign merchants do not comply with Chinese laws and do not affix stamp duty, Chinese merchants have no responsibility to be penalized on their behalf. The court should be able to defend the Chinese merchant in cases of violations. Therefore, the first concern of the Association does not seem to be a problem. However, if the second instance is considered an invalid document because it is not stamped, the result is that the foreign merchant escapes tax and is exempted from fulfilling their obligations under the contract, which causes Chinese merchants to suffer a double loss. Is there a remedial measure? We respectfully request the Ministry's review and instructions for compliance in the public interest. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce kowtows, Ke.</p>
<h3>County Government Announces One-Year Extension of Grain Loan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the provincial government stating that due to the difficulties in repaying the old pre-borrowed winter grain loan in Jiangsu Province this year due to the disaster, the repayment will be extended for another year. Pan County Chief, after receiving the document, instructed the County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office to inform the public and issued an announcement yesterday to inform the public. It is reported that the old pre-borrowed winter grain loan still owes 4.5 yuan per picul. It was originally scheduled to be repaid in five years from 1930 to 1934. However, due to the provincial treasury deficits over the years, it has been repeatedly extended.</p>
<h3>Kaiming Bookstore Welcomed Shao Lizi Yesterday Afternoon</h3>

<h3>Kong Xiangrong Inspects River Works</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, a member of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee and Director of Labor Relief, along with Secretary Wang Yujun, inspected Ye Jingyuan, Sang Zetong, Liu Bingzhong, Bureau Chief Hua Deming, and Supervisor Cao Shouhong, and personally visited Guantai to inspect the East and West Dam projects. The workers on both dams were very enthusiastic and received awards based on their merit. The next morning, he took the Zhiyuan steamboat to inspect the Fenglou area and then went to Jiugulu to personally supervise and urge the closure of the No. 21 breach within the specified time. The telegram sent to Bureau Chief Hua and the current status of the project are recorded below: (1) To Bureau Chief Hua: Since this group's supervisors started work on the Guantai damming project, the work has been progressing fairly quickly, which is commendable. However,麻稭料 must still be ordered to be transported according to the estimated amount as soon as possible, without negligence, so as not to delay the project. As for the materials for each breach on Jiugulu, although the Bureau Chief has ordered and prepared them, the materials submitted are still insufficient. It is imperative to urge the transport of materials to the site without any slackening. Cold weather is approaching quickly, and time is of the essence. We hope that you will actively plan and proceed quickly to complete the project within the specified time in order to achieve complete success. The construction of Chinese and foreign small dikes is especially urgent. This project is an important barrier for the Shiche section. It should be wide, thick, and long enough to ensure the safety of the main dike. Also, the top width of the breaches in the riverbank and the Dachiezhuang Ditch should be at least two zhang, and the Dachiezhuang Ditch should be reinforced with a后蔕. A section of护船埽 should be built along the river, and nearby villagers should be informed of the importance of protecting the dike to provide protection. It is hereby ordered that the Bureau Chief immediately handle the above matters separately and simultaneously and report the compliance status to the verification and transfer. This is of utmost importance. Kong Xiangrong, Member of the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government and Director of the Labor Relief Group, Yang. (2) Recent Project News: Ye Jingyuan and others telegraphed from Guantai to report the Guantai project progress, income, material costs, and labor numbers as follows: Day and night work has been ongoing, and the Xiangdong Dam occupies a length of eight zhang, a width of two zhang five chi, and a height of two chi six cun, with 48,000 jin of straw material, ten six-zhang ropes, ten walnut cables, fifty five-chi stakes, and fifty six-chi stakes, 34 river soldiers, and 129 Mao laborers.

<h3>Reorganization of the Two Railways' Trade Unions</h3>
<p>Trade Unions Reported Dissolution and Handover</p>
<p>Reorganization Personnel Sworn into Office</p>
<p>The Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, considering that the trade union organizations of the two railways were not sound and that work could not be promoted, decided to send personnel to reorganize them. Three comrades who had participated in the people's movement work and were familiar with the trade union situation of the two railways, Zhang Yunhe, Zhang Ji, and Chen Junpei, were appointed as reorganization instructors, and five people, Pan Xiangqin, Hong Desheng, Luo Lairong, Xue Jie, and Yuan Qiaofu, were appointed as reorganization personnel.

The various levels of Party departments and trade union branch offices of the two railways all believed that the decisive action taken by the two railways' Party Department to send personnel to reorganize the two railways' trade unions was fortunate for the future of the labor movement, and they telegraphed their support and assistance. It is also reported that the members of the two railways' Party Department are scheduled to go to Beijing tonight with the reorganization instructors and reorganization personnel to present the situation to the Central Party Department and seek instructions on the direction of the reorganization.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Donates Disaster Relief Funds from Both the Management and Employees</h3>
<p>All sectors of the city have been very enthusiastic about the urgent disaster relief public donation.

Starting from January 3, they will resume work as usual, and the salary for one day that the museum would have paid will be donated in the name of the employees as disaster relief funds, estimated at 2,000 yuan. The museum will donate another 1,500 yuan, for a total of 3,500 yuan, and will donate it separately to the city's Emergency Disaster Relief Public Donation Committee for disaster areas.</p>

<h3>Songpu Vessel Awaits High Tide for Another Rescue Attempt</h3>
<p>After the Sanbei Company's Songpu vessel ran aground near Digang last Friday, it became deeply mired in the sand because there was only seven feet of water in the area, while the Songpu vessel needed eleven feet. The Shanghai head office sent the Shangjiang vessel Fuyang, along with a flatbed barge, to the vicinity of the Songpu to begin unloading the cargo from the Songpu vessel. Subsequently, it also telegraphed the Yanhufu Branch to send all of its flatbed barges to load the cargo unloaded from the Songpu. All passengers on the ship have been transferred to Hankou by the Fuyang barge. According to the crew of the Xingshi vessel, which returned to Shanghai yesterday, even after all the cargo was unloaded from the Songpu, it could not be towed out of the shallow water because the draft was still too deep. Therefore, a second decision was made to unload the ship's own coal. It is hoped that it can be towed out after the coal is unloaded, but the river water in the area has now fallen to low tide, leaving only six feet of water on the right, with no hope of getting out of the shallow water. Yesterday, according to the shipowner's report, the ship is waiting for the high tide this month to try to tow it out again. It is best if it can be rescued, otherwise it will be difficult to rescue it this winter and it will not be able to get out of the shallow water until the next spring flood season.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank's Credit Small Loan Volume Greatly Increases</h3>
<p>Currently Adding Restrictions Due to the Year-End Closing Period</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Bank's Jing'an Temple Road branch started offering credit small loans, the general working class has been able to get emergency financing, and praises have been pouring in from society. Many other banks have followed suit, but their procedures are not as convenient as this bank. Yesterday, the reporter met with Mr. Xi Yushu, the manager of the bank, and had the following conversation: Reporter: When did you start offering small loans? Answer: In 1930, our bank's general manager, Mr. Chen Guangfu, initiated it and instructed the former manager, Mr. Dong Chengdao, to start it. Reporter: How do you apply? Answer: It's very simple. Anyone who lives in Shanghai and has a legitimate job, regardless of industry, commerce, education, or government, can first obtain an application form from any branch, fill it out according to the instructions, and submit it directly to this branch. Reporter: What happens after the application is submitted? Answer: After the application is submitted, the bank will send someone to investigate. Whether you are qualified or not, we can usually reply within a week. Reporter: What sectors are most commonly applying? Answer: Our bank has no preconceptions, so applicants include government, commercial, and other institutions, as well as small business owners. The amount of our loans, from 50 yuan to 500 yuan, is just right to meet the short-term needs of all sectors. Reporter: What is the amount of loans given out? Answer: Initially, during the trial period, the former manager was cautious, so not many loans were given out. From the beginning of the program to this spring, the total amount was no more than 500,000 yuan. However, I believe that in the current economic downturn, small loans are indeed a necessity to help the general working class and small business owners, so I expanded the loan amount based on the previous good results. In the past few months, the loan amount has exceeded 1.5 million yuan, and there are more than 8,000 borrowers. Reporter: With such progress, have there been any bad debts? Answer: This is inevitable, but the bank carefully investigates beforehand, and the borrowers are mostly trustworthy, so the bad debt rate is 5/1000. The current loan amount is no longer small, so this is unavoidable. Reporter: Sometimes, those who are refused loans are not given a reason. Why is that? Answer: Sometimes, the guarantor does not want to act as a guarantor. In order to maintain the friendship between the applicant and the guarantor, it is difficult to announce the reason. Sometimes it is difficult to say directly that the applicant's credit is not very reliable, so we keep it secret. Reporter: What is the success rate of loan approvals? Answer: It is difficult to set a standard. Sometimes the applicants are all reliable, so the loan is fully approved. Sometimes the results are not good, so all applications are rejected. But according to past statistics, about two-thirds of the applications are approved, and about one-third are rejected. Reporter: At this time, when the money market is tight, will your bank continue to offer small loans? Answer: I believe that small loans are intended to support those who are suffering from economic pressure and to avoid pain, so we will not stop. However, because there are too many applicants at this time, and the year-end closing period is also approaching, we will temporarily add some restrictions for the purpose of clearing the accounts.</p>

<h3>Car Runs Over Villager on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road</h3>
<p>Car No. 6363. The injured person was sent to Minhang Hospital. Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway, cars have been traveling back and forth incessantly. Some careless drivers inevitably cause casualties. The previous day, car No. 6363 from Shanghai was traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou when, near Caojing in western Shanghai, it knocked down a villager, Mr. Jia, from the Twelfth District of Fahua Bridge in Fengxian County. The villager suffered head injuries and bled profusely, losing consciousness. The driver, realizing he had caused a major accident, sped away. Fortunately, someone informed the Caojing section station master, who immediately used a long-distance phone call to notify the Minhang station master to intercept and detain the car. Meanwhile, the local police sent Mr. Jia to the nearby Minhang Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries are severe, and due to excessive blood loss, his life may be in danger.</p>

<h3>The Palace Museum Embezzlement Case: Chunyun's Initial Disclosure, Xiao Xiangpei Arrested, Very Strict Custody</h3>
<p>Xiao, a former clerk in the Palace Museum, has been dismissed.</p>
<p>He remained in Shanghai to hand over procedures.</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Palace Museum treasure theft and embezzlement case, which was once a sensation, was initiated on October 13 of this year by the Jiangning Court Prosecutor, who collected evidence of theft and filed charges against nine people, including Yi Peiji, Li Zongtong, Chen Yu, Xiao Yu, Cui Xiebang, Yan Yuanhuai, Qin Hanggong, Dong Lin, and Zhang Songqi. Although evidence was obtained, the accused were in hiding and could not be tried. The Supreme Court sent a letter to the Ping Municipal Government to cooperate in arresting Yi Peiji and others for investigation. As a result, the news subsided. Recently, Yi's confidant, Xiao Xiangpei, was arrested in Shanghai and brought to trial. The following are the details learned by Xin Sheng She reporters.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiangpei's Experience in the Palace Museum. Xiao Xiangpei is from Hunan and is a fellow villager of Yi Peiji. When Yi Peiji was appointed as the Director of the Beiping Palace Museum in 1929, Xiao was summoned by Yi and entered the Palace Museum to work. Due to Xiao's honest and taciturn nature, even though he was promoted by Yi, he remained a minor clerk in the museum, earning a monthly salary of ninety yuan. Xiao did not seek more and was content with his job. When Yi was in office and embezzled treasures, Xiao was in Ping. Later, when the September 18th Incident occurred and the ancient capital became tense, the antiques were transported south, and Xiao participated in the packing work of all the antiques. Later, he followed the antiques to the south and remained in the Shanghai office, still as a clerk, with the same monthly salary, without increase or decrease.</p>
<p>Dismissed but Not Yet Departed. Later, when the Palace Museum treasure theft case was discovered, Yi Peiji went into hiding. Ma Heng, a professor at Peking University, took over as director. After Ma took office, he reported to the authorities that the Palace Museum had too many redundant staff and implemented a large-scale dismissal. Xiao was a confidant of Yi and his position was not important, so he was also on the list of those to be dismissed. However, because the procedures were not completed, he had not yet left the Shanghai office, even though he had been dismissed. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, he was arrested at the Shanghai office of the Palace Museum at No. 20 Yong'an Fang. The Second Special Court ruled to transfer him to the Shanghai Local Court and assigned personnel to escort him back to the capital for trial.</p>
<p>Family in Shanghai in Panic. Xiao was originally alone in Shanghai. A month ago, Xiao's wife brought their three children to Shanghai and resided in the right lane of Xiaoshijie on Fuyou Road in the city. Xiao's arrest caused panic throughout the family. Because they were new to Shanghai, they were unfamiliar with the people and the place and had no way to seek help. After Xiao was arrested, Judge Xiong Huiping of the Second Special District Local Court briefly interrogated him. Due to the close connection to the major treasure theft case, the custody was very strict, and no one outside knew the details. It is rumored that Xiao Xiangpei is Xiao Yu, but this is not the case. Xiao Yu is the head of the Ping Agricultural Experiment Station, while Xiao Xiangpei is a minor clerk.</p>
<h3>Cao Zilai Invents a Buoyancy Device to Salvage the Sunk Grand Canal Vessel</h3>
<p>Public Demonstration Yesterday</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Support from All Parties</p>
<p>When ships sink, all countries have salvage methods, but our country has not yet invented a ship salvage device. Therefore, whenever a merchant ship accident occurs, we always ask the Japanese to salvage it. Recently, Cao Zilai, a Chinese, spent several years of painstaking effort to specialize in researching ship salvage devices, burying himself in hard work, and has now succeeded. Yesterday, Mr. Cao specially brought the invented ship salvage device to the Shipping Club for a demonstration, inviting representatives from the Shanghai shipping insurance industry to observe. The reporter also went to observe with Mr. Li Yunliang and Mr. Chen Ganqing and talked with Mr. Cao on the spot. The results of the demonstration were quite satisfactory. The Grand Canal vessel sunk outside Chongming is now being salvaged by Mr. Cao using his invented equipment, which is worth recording. Therefore, it is described in detail.</p>
<p>Three Inventions. Cao Zilai is from Chongming. In recent years, he has been engaged in the principles of physics and researching underwater science. After several years of experimentation and improvement, he has invented (1) a buoyancy device, which uses extremely strong materials with high strength, elasticity, and airtightness to create buoyancy devices for salvaging sunken merchant ships; (2) a sinking device, which is used to eliminate floating vessels at sea and reduce enemy ship targets during wartime; the plan has been secretly submitted to the central government; (3) a diving suit, divided into soft and hard shell types, with the soft suit especially suitable for the national character of our people to wear into the sea, which is also being manufactured. Model Demonstration. Mr. Cao's buoyancy device has been successfully developed. Recently, with the introduction of Mr. Li Yunliang, the Chief Auditor of the Recruitment Bureau, all representatives of the Shanghai marine insurance industry were invited to gather at the Shipping Club at No. 10 Guangdong Road at 1:50 PM yesterday to publicly demonstrate the ship salvage method. Mr. Cao used a large glass box filled with water and placed a specially made iron model ship in the middle. The iron content of the ship was 7.8, compared to 2.3 for the same volume of sand and mud, increasing the weight fivefold. After Mr. Cao explained the principle of the invention to the public, he connected the invented buoyancy device, which used an air bag, tightly around the sunken ship and inflated it. The sunken ship gradually floated up.</p>
<p>Same Principle. After the demonstration, Cao said to the public, "Today's demonstration uses a model to represent the situation. However, if a merchant ship sinks at sea, using this method to salvage it would require a larger ship body, and the air bag used for buoyancy would naturally also need to be enlarged. In fact, there is resistance." Cao said again, "One cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds. According to this, an enlarged air bag, composed of steel wires, is sufficient to overcome this buoyancy force and can be completely successful." Assuming we are salvaging a 1,600-ton sunken ship, Cao said that he is very confident in the salvage, and the estimated cost is only 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Trying to Salvage a Sunken Vessel. The Grand Canal vessel, which travels between Shanghai and Chongming, has been sunk for many years near Chongwaibaochen Port. The ship was not insured and has not been salvaged. Now, Mr. Cao has volunteered to salvage the ship using his invented ship salvage device and has contacted the shipowner. The shipowner is willing to pay a salvage fee of 32,000 yuan to entrust Cao with the salvage. Various Shanghai insurance companies have expressed extreme support for Mr. Cao's actions. The Nantong County Government and the County Party Headquarters have also raised the issue at 23 meetings, and County Magistrate Jin Jiahua and Standing Committee member Chen Guanying have publicly decided to unanimously support and encourage him.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Statistics Association Releases National Cotton Production Statistics Yesterday</h3>
<p>Imports of Foreign Cotton Are Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>New Cotton from This Year Has Not Yet Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>China's cotton production this year has increased by more than 10% compared to previous years. Imports of American and Indian cotton have sharply decreased. According to the national cotton production statistics released by the Cotton Industry Statistics Association yesterday, the cotton production quantities for 1933 and this year are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Decreasing Imports. According to the Cotton Industry Statistics Association's statistics last year, the national cotton production was 9,774,207 dan. This year's second estimate is 11,172,553 dan of ginned cotton. Compared with last year, this year's production has increased by 1,398,346 dan. In 1932, Chinese yarn factories used approximately one million large bales of American cotton. As of the first half of this year, foreign cotton imports have gradually decreased, now falling to 170,000 bales. It is predicted that the number will be even lower in the second half of the year. There are three reasons for this: (1) American cotton prices are high; (2) exchange rates are too expensive; (3) China's cotton production has increased. Therefore, from January to October of this year, imports of foreign cotton were approximately 1.4 million dan. The total for the entire previous year was approximately 2 million dan. The reason for the decrease this year is that domestic cotton production has increased. Subsequent imports will decrease year by year.</p>
<p>Total Cotton Consumption. According to statistics from the Chinese Yarn Factory Federation, the total cotton consumption of yarn factories nationwide in the second half of last year and the first half of this year is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>First Half of 1934 Second Half of 1933</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton 919,279 841,709</p>
<p>American Cotton 175,652 341,366</p>
<p>Indian Cotton 88,306 97,060</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton 8,449 9,828</p>
<p>Other 1,166 328</p>
<p>Total 1,192,852 1,190,290</p>
<p>The above figures are in bales, each weighing 500 pounds.</p>
<p>New Cotton Not Yet Arrived. Among China's cotton-producing regions, Shaanxi, Shandong, Hebei, and Hunan provinces have the largest production. Cotton is usually available on the market around October. In previous years, a large amount arrived in Shanghai. This year, however, it has not been seen, which has surprised those in charge of various factories. After sending personnel to investigate, the truth became clear. There are four reasons: (1) This autumn, there has been much rain in the north and severe drought in the south, causing cotton growth to be slower, 20 days to a month later than in previous years; (2) This year, cotton farmers in the north and northwest have had good harvests of barley in the previous year, and cotton production is also abundant this year. The wheat they are currently growing is also good, and the economic situation is good. They are not in a hurry to sell cotton, so there are very few selling on the market, and it is all hoarded by the villagers to seek a good price; (3) Although cotton prices are higher this year than in previous years, the villagers are greedy and unwilling to sell, all engaging in speculation; (4) New cotton-producing areas, such as Lingbao in Shaanxi, have inconvenient freight car allocation on the Longhai Railway, so it is all stockpiled in warehouses, waiting for empty cars to travel south. Due to these several reasons, the new cotton of this year has not yet arrived in abundance.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu High Court Borrows Shanghai Court to Retrial Li Guojie Case</h3>
<p>Security Very Strict</p>
<p>Listening Seats are Full</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was involved in an embezzlement case in September of the year before, involving a huge amount of 700,000 taels of silver. After the case was discovered and the local court conducted the first trial, Li Guojie was sentenced to three years in prison for breach of trust. Li refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. As a result of the second trial, the charge was changed to embezzlement, and the sentence was increased to three and a half years. Li still refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. Li was still sent to the Shanghai Hospital at the Nantao Wharf in Nanshi for treatment due to illness, which has been for more than a year. The Supreme Court has now remanded the case to the Suzhou High Court for retrial and has officially scheduled the hearing for December 21st at the Shanghai Local Court. This information has been reported previously. Yesterday was the scheduled date. At 1:00 PM, Chen Junfang, the judicial police chief of the Local Court, and Chen Xihui, the police officer, went to the Shanghai Hospital to escort Li Guojie to the court. Meanwhile, the West Gate Branch dispatched patrol officers Nie Chaowen and Dai Mingkai, police chief Su Xianyao, and eight police officers, as well as detectives Yu Ruhai, Zheng Yongxiang, and Bian Wenguang, to escort and care for him along the way to show caution. The Suzhou High Court assigned Presiding Judge Hu Shanjie, Judges Si Wen and Zhang Zepu, Prosecutor Shen Bingqian, and Clerks Shen Yuren and Ding Yi to come to Shanghai by car. The general public who wanted to listen to the hearing first obtained hearing tickets from the High Court at the entrance before being allowed to enter the court to listen. However, this case has attracted much attention from society, so the listening seats were full. The judicial police chief Chen Junfang, the police officer Chen Xihui, and many bailiffs under the supervision of Patrol Officer Nie maintained order around the courtroom. At 1:30 PM, Presiding Judge Hu, along with Judges Si and Zhang, and Prosecutor Shen, took their seats in the first courtroom. Private prosecution attorneys Wang Youling and Li's lawyers Jiang Yiping, Lu Hongyi, and Lu Shifang arrived in court one after another. Presiding Judge Hu ordered Li Guojie to be brought to court. (Li was wearing a dark wool coat, with a medicated plaster for a headache on his temple, and looked dejected and spoke very softly.) He stated that he was 54 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, and lived on Haining Road. (Asked) "How is your illness?" (Answered) "My limbs are numb and have not yet recovered." (Asked) The official said, "Now that the Supreme Court has remanded the case for retrial, you should provide a detailed account of the situation." (Answered) "Since taking over as the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in 1932 and concurrently serving as the chairman of the board, I intended to develop and reorganize everything. The loans were secured by more than 17 or 18 mu of land on North Sichuan Road, such as Jinliyuan Wharf, and five wharves including the North and Middle Warehouses and the Pudong Yangjiadu China Warehouse, mortgaged for a total of 20 million taels." (Asked) "When were the loan documents signed?" (Answered) "I was ordered by Supervisor Chen Fumu to sign on behalf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as the general manager and chairman of the board on September 5th and 6th of 1932. (Asked) "Do you know Wang Jusu?" (Answered) "He was Chen Fumu's representative. The 700,000 taels of checks were taken by Wang Jusu on the orders of Chen Fumu." (Asked) "The amount of 700,000 taels is very large, why did you hand it over so easily?" (Answered) "That night, I called Chen Fumu, but he was out, so I went to Chen Fumu's house the next day and met with Chen. According to Chen, the receipts would be processed and given to me later. I thought I should obey the orders of my superior. I thought that after receiving Supervisor Chen's receipt, I would then register the account, but unfortunately, this happened. Because Chen Fumu was the Deputy Minister and Supervisor, I did not suspect him. Earlier, Chen Fumu called me and said that he ordered Wang Jusu to come and take the money and would replenish it with official business later." Then, witness Dou Yaoting, 43 years old, from Yin County, Zhejiang, who worked as a comprador in the American-owned China Trading Company, testified that the loan contract for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was handled by the manager and directly contacted Li Guojie. On September 23, 1932, the manager ordered me to send the 700,000 taels of checks to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and hand them over to Li Guojie, around 3:00 or 4:00 PM. When I entered Li's office downstairs at the time, Li Guojie seemed to know my intention. There were a total of fourteen checks, and Li issued a receipt from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (Asked) "Did you see Wang Jusu?" (Answered) "I didn't notice. I didn't sit down and left." At this point in the hearing, Li Guojie stated that Wang Jusu was also present at the time. (Asked) "Does Li Guojie know the current addresses of Chen Fumu and Wang Jusu?" Li (Answered) "I don't know." Attorney Jiang stood up and stated that Chen Fumu and others were far away overseas and would definitely not come to court and requested that Li be allowed to post bail. The official said, "The matter is of great importance and cannot be approved." The case requires investigation and will be heard again later. During the interrogation, Li Guojie could not stand for long due to illness, so he was instructed to sit and answer questions. After the court adjourned, Police Officer Chen Xihui escorted Li Guojie in a car back to the Shanghai Hospital for continued surveillance. Patrol Officers Nie and Dai led the police officers and detectives in separate cars to escort them, to avoid any negligence.</p>
<h3>Continuing Record of Yi Fangshuo's Trial</h3>
<p>Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen Suddenly Unwilling to Accuse</p>
<p>Defendant's Request for Bail Rejected by Judge</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a native of Hangzhou residing at No. 147, Baxianfang Entrance, Huage Nie Road, French Concession, who performed comedic plays at the New New Company rooftop amusement park, was arrested for repeatedly raping his cousin Yi Baozhu (19 years old) and monitoring her movements. On the 11th of this month, Baozhu seized an opportunity to escape and reported to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Yi. They also brought in thirteen young actresses from his troupe for questioning. It was further discovered that Yi had sexually assaulted Li Xiaozhen, his concubine Yi Meimei's thirteen-year-old sister. He was ordered to be detained, and the next day, he was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation, as detailed in previous reports.</p>
<p>The police investigation concluded, and at 11:30 AM yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozu presided over a continued trial in the First Criminal Court. Nearly a hundred family members and friends of Yi Fangshuo were present in the audience. After the court opened, the defendant was brought in and briefly questioned about his name and age. Then, police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, stating that the police investigation revealed that Yi Baozhu was adopted by the defendant's uncle, Yi Fusheng, as his daughter at the age of two. When Yi Fusheng and his wife passed away when she was eight, she was raised by the defendant's stepmother. In November of last year, the defendant sent a letter to his mother, requesting that Baozhu be sent to Shanghai to learn acting from him. On the second day after arriving in Shanghai, the defendant allegedly lured her out on the pretext of getting her teeth fixed, taking her to a hotel and raping her. Afterwards, the defendant had his concubine, Wang Caitao, and others monitor Baozhu's movements. Baozhu also witnessed the defendant raping Li Xiaozhen. The police are now prosecuting him under Articles 240, 243, and 316 of the Criminal Law for offenses against public morals and infringement of freedom. The investigation also revealed that the defendant bought and sold people, purchasing Yi Jinzhu for 150 yuan and Yang Linmei for an unknown price. The police are also prosecuting him under Article 257 of the Criminal Law, requesting legal action. At this point, the court declared the hearing closed to the public.</p>
<p>After the audience members left, the defendant Yi Fangshuo was questioned about the rape of the two women. He denied it, claiming that Yi Jinzhu was introduced to him by Chief Ye of the Zhejiang Water Police as a maid who wanted to learn acting at his place. Yang Lindi was his cousin's younger sister who was brought to be the adopted daughter-in-law of his nephew, and she was sent to his house to learn acting. As for the monitoring, he claimed that he was their acting teacher, and because there were many kidnappers outside, and he was afraid they would be hit by vehicles on the road, he sent people to accompany them. After the performance, he would order them to go home and not allow them to go out.</p>
<p>The judge then summoned the complainants, Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen, who both stated that they did not wish to accuse him and requested permission for a peaceful resolution. Yi Baozhu's guardian, Yi Hu (the defendant's stepmother), and Li Xiaozhen's father, Li Duofu, also hired lawyers who tearfully stated that they all depended on the defendant for their livelihood and did not wish to accuse him, requesting permission to take the girls back. The judge then asked the police for their opinion. Lawyer Fei stated that Articles 240 and 243 of the Criminal Law require prosecution by complaint, and since the complainants had withdrawn their complaints, the police had no objections. However, the court had the right to conduct a trial for Articles 257 and 316. The judge then summoned Yi Jinzhu and Yang Senzhu, but they did not appear, so the trial could not proceed. The court then announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the afternoon of the 24th. The defendant's defense lawyer requested that the defendant be granted bail to await trial outside of custody, but the judge ruled that the case involved human rights and public morals, and the circumstances were severe, so bail could not be granted. He ordered the defendant to remain in custody. Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen were temporarily allowed to be taken away by Yi Hu and Li Duofu. The judge ordered that the two girls still had to appear in court on the adjourned date and could not leave, and after being taken away, they could no longer reside in the defendant's home. Yi Hu and Li Duofu acknowledged the order and took their daughters away before leaving the court.</p>

<h3>Woman Sues After Becoming Pregnant Following Three Years of Cohabitation and Half a Month of Marriage</h3>
<p>Impending Childbirth Requires Funds</p>
<p>Former Husband Denies Paternity</p>
<p>Zhang Guiying, a woman from Guangdong who is 28 years old, is of unremarkable appearance and stout build. Most of her relationships are temporary, leading to frequent separations and reunions. Three years ago, she became romantically involved with Chen Jianxun, a fellow villager of similar age. Initially, they were very compatible. By April of this year, both felt the need to formalize their relationship through marriage. They soon chose an auspicious date for the wedding. However, their informal cohabitation lasted three years, but their formal marriage lasted only half a month, from April 24th to May 16th. There may be no shorter-lived marriage in the world.</p>
<p>Now, the woman's belly is as big as a five-stone urn, and childbirth is imminent. She claims that the child in her womb is Chen's, and although they are divorced, Chen should still be responsible for the cost of childbirth. She sued Chen in the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering him to pay 200 yuan for childbirth expenses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan opened the court to hear the case. According to the woman's testimony, she and Chen had been cohabiting for three years, and she had given birth to a son last year. However, after their marriage on April 24th of this year, Chen gradually tricked her out of all her gold and silver jewelry, leading to her abandonment. He drafted a divorce agreement and gathered ruffians to force her to sign it. However, her pregnancy is nearing term, and she requires funds for childbirth, which she requests the defendant to pay 200 yuan. Chen Jianxun admitted to the court that he had initially cohabited with the woman, then married her, and finally divorced her by signing an agreement. However, he denied that the child in her womb was his and claimed that he had already provided financial support at the time of the divorce and had no ability to provide additional funds. Zhang Guiying then asked the court what to do after the baby was born. Judge Qiao replied that this was another matter and that if there were any disputes in the future, a lawsuit to confirm identity should be filed, which cannot be predicted now. As for this case, he advised them to go out and reconcile. If a peaceful resolution is ultimately impossible, the court will reconvene on the afternoon of the 28th of this month for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Two Red Pill Dens Cracked</h3>
<p>One on Peng Road, One on North Jiangxi Road</p>
<p>Bai Pu, a Western detective from the Narcotics Department, and Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective, learned that someone was selling the drug "red pills" for profit inside No. 572 Peng Road. They sent an informant with two Chinese Industrial Bank one-yuan banknotes (serial numbers copied) to purchase red pills and confirm the information. At 11:45 PM the day before yesterday, they coordinated with Central and Western detectives to arrest Fu Shimei from Shaoxing, Mrs. Wang Zhang from Yangzhou, and Mrs. Sun Li at the address. Seven yuan of the original banknotes were found on Mrs. Wang Zhang, and ten packs of red pills (totaling 5,000 pills) were found on Mrs. Sun Li. They were interrogated and revealed the location of the pill-making den at No. 431 North Jiangxi Road. Detectives rushed to the den and arrested He Haiming from Wenzhou and Mrs. Wu Xu from Hangzhou. In a room on the third floor, they seized a pill-making machine, six large packs of red pills (totaling 11,000 pills), and baking ovens and lead buckets. They were all taken to the Hongkou Police Station, detained separately, and escorted to Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Lisi Shan, a lawyer for the Bureau of Public Works, stated the previous situation and requested an extension to investigate who the principal offenders were. The Central and Western detectives then reported the investigation process and presented the evidence for inspection. Questioned about the evidence, the defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Wu Zehan ordered that they remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Dianchuntang Property Lawsuit Concludes</h3>
<p>Both Parties Receive Supreme Court Judgment</p>
<p>The property lawsuit involving the Shanghai Yimiao Dianchuntang estate, which began last July between the Seafood and Grocery Trade Association and the Sugar Trade Association due to claims of joint ownership, has concluded. The Shanghai Local Court ruled that the Seafood Trade Association had a 2/10 ownership share in Dianchuntang. The Sugar Trade Association, dissatisfied with the ruling, appealed to the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Later, they filed a third appeal to the Supreme Court, hoping to overturn the original verdict. It was learned yesterday that both associations had received the Supreme Court's judgment, which also dismissed the Sugar Trade Association's appeal. Therefore, the property dispute that stirred the entire city has now come to an end.</p>
<h3>Tongde Submits Written Report on Harvard Ship Incident</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications received a report from Dafaxing yesterday regarding the collision between the Tongde ship and the Harvard ship on the 17th. The report was based on the "Nautical Log." The captain of the Tongde ship, Norwegian An Kierxun, also submitted a similar report, which was countersigned by the ship's first mate, Qu Zhenbang, as a witness. The original report is as follows:</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, at 8:20 AM, [we] left the Zhonghua Wharf to go to Qingdao. The ship was completely empty, intending to transport coal from Qingdao to Longtan. [We] were sailing north along Pudong. At about 8:56 AM, [we] saw a little of the bow of the Harvard ship. Because [we] were at the bend of Lujiazui, near the Pudong side, [we] could not see the entire ship, even though [we] were only two or three ship lengths away. I immediately sounded a long horn to warn the other ship, but the other ship did not respond. About half a minute later, [we] sounded a short horn to indicate that [our] ship was sailing to the right. The other ship also responded with a short horn. However, the other ship was still sailing head-on. At that time, the tide was rising, and [our] ship was moving very slowly, but because [we] were being pushed by the tide, [we] were still moving. Seeing that the other ship did not give way, I immediately sounded three short horns and reversed the engine at full speed. After about two or three minutes, the bow of the Harvard ship collided with the bow of [our] ship. The location was very close to the Water Police Lighthouse ship. [Our] ship was still reversing. The Harvard ship, being pushed by the tide, continued to move forward. The bow of the ship sailed southwest, dropped anchor, turned its head, and ran aground on the beach at the Chunjiang Wharf (outside the city ferry terminal). [Our] ship immediately dropped anchor. At 9:10 AM, [we] raised the anchor and sailed to Yangshupu, between buoys 45 and 44. This is the truth.</p>

<h3>Qingnian from Pinghu Attempts Suicide by Jumping into the River</h3>
<p>Sent Back to His Hometown by the Fellow-Villagers Association</p>
<p>Qian Huangcheng from Pinghu, 16 years old, was formerly a student at a certain lumber company. Recently, due to unemployment and economic reasons, he had the idea of committing suicide. Yesterday, he boarded a boat and jumped into the Huangpu River. He was rescued by the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and transferred to the Pinghu Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association for disposal. It is heard that the association, fearing that he would attempt to jump into the river again on the way, specially sent someone to accompany him back to his hometown and hand him over to the Pinghu Public Security Bureau to visit his family and receive him.</p>
<h3>Abusive Woman Held Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Chen Wu, a Guangdong woman, 28 years old, who lives at No. 723 Tiantong Road, is habitually tyrannical and has no children. Last summer, she spent 50 yuan to buy 12-year-old Xu Xingbao, a girl from Changshu Meili Township, in name as an adopted daughter, but in reality as a slave. Initially, because of her young age, the treatment was not bad. In the spring of this year, she began to have her do the work of a servant. The girl was not up to the task, and with a little negligence, she would be brutally beaten, using wooden sticks and rattan canes to inflict painful beatings. Recently, she has become more ruthless. If the girl did not wash clothes cleanly, she would use a small hammer to knock her hands, the most horrific instrument. She would heat up a clothing iron and burn the girl's back and waist, causing the girl to be covered in injuries, as if she were in a fiery pit. At about 9:00 PM on the 18th, Ms. Chen ordered the girl to go to the nearby coal stove to get hot water in a thermos. She accidentally broke the bottle and did not dare to go home, fearing being burned with a hot iron. She cried sadly on the road. Patrolman No. 469 of the street police inquired and learned the whole story. He took the girl to the Hongkou Police Station, and Chen Wu, along with the wooden sticks, rattan canes, hammer, and iron, were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. A forensic doctor examined Xu's injuries in detail. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Criminal Court No. 3 to hear the case. The court read out the forensic report, which stated that the girl had many wooden stick and rattan cane injuries on her arms and legs, of varying degrees of bruising. The back of her hands and fingers had fractures from being hit with a hammer that had not yet healed. Her back and waist had obvious burns from an iron. Questioned about it, Ms. Chen's testimony was evasive. She insisted that she had only used wooden sticks to beat her. Lisi Shan, a lawyer for the Bureau of Public Works, stated that the weather was very cold, and Xu was only wearing a tattered pair of single pants with holes in her lower body. Her feet were bare. The areas burned by the iron were already inflamed and likely to fester. The defendant was cruel and ruthless and did not treat her as an adopted daughter. She was regarded as a slave and abused to this extent. She had no regard for the law, human feelings, morality, or humanity. Please punish her severely. Judge Wu ordered Chen Wu to be remanded in custody and scheduled for sentencing. Xu was sent back to the Jiliang Institute to stay.</p>
<h3>He Weixu Sues Estranged Wife for Cohabitation</h3>
<p>He Weixu, 24 years old, a native of Ningbo and former employee of the Asia Electric Company, who lives at No. 484 Baoding Road, married Liu Wanzhen (21 years old), a woman from Zhenhai who resides at No. 18 Xiudeli, Beck Road, through a matchmaker on October 31st of last year. The couple's relationship was quite harmonious. In June of this year, she gave birth to a child, who is now three months old. However, on October 23rd of this year, Liu suddenly returned to her mother's house. After several months, He hired a lawyer to file a petition with the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering Ms. Liu to cohabit with him and return the clothes and jewelry she had taken. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai opened the Civil Court No. 7 to hear the case. According to He Weixu's testimony, the reason for the defendant's departure was that in December of last year, the defendant took jewelry, etc., to her parents' house, which I found out about. I rebuked her for not obtaining my consent. On October 23rd of this year, I ordered the defendant to take back the jewelry, and she abandoned her three-month-old baby and left suddenly. Therefore, I request a judgment ordering her to cohabit with me. Questioned about it, the defendant Liu Wanzhen testified that since she married into the family, the plaintiff's brother had contracted syphilis, and her mother-in-law blamed her for having bad luck. Not long after entering the family, the eldest brother contracted a malignant disease, and she was constantly scolded. She could no longer bear to cohabit. She had filed a separate lawsuit for divorce. The defendant's father then testified, stating that since his daughter returned to Ningbo on October 23rd, because the weather was getting colder, he accompanied his daughter to retrieve her clothes on the 26th, but the plaintiff reported it to the police and had him detained. Judge Luo advised them to reconcile in court, but it was unsuccessful. After ordering the start of the debate, he announced that he would issue a judgment at a later date.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Oil Pressing Industry Association Petitions to Maintain Northeast Soybean Oil Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Pressing Industry Association, regarding the import tax on Northeast-shipped soybean oil, sent a telegram to the Yuan Ministry on the 11th, requesting that the original plan be maintained. Since no reply has been received, another telegram has been sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting relief. The telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Respected Chairman Chiang of the Nanchang Headquarters,</p>
<p>We respectfully submit that our country's import tax originally set the tax rate for commercial goods at 15% of the value and for food oils at 30% of the value. It has been found that the initial import tax levied on Northeast-shipped food soybean oil was 15% of the value. The subsequent correction of the mistake to 30% of the value was extremely fair. This was to avoid the dumping of goods from the Northeast, manipulating the economy, and protecting our country's industry and commerce. The intention was excellent. However, recently we heard that some people were taking the opportunity to oppose it, presenting a request to the Ministry of Finance to change the tax on food soybean oil to be taxed as commercial goods. After the association learned of this, it sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, requesting that the original order be maintained. However, no reply has been received, and the community is extremely anxious.</p>
<p>It has been found that soybean oil has always been a major food item in our country, and it is rarely needed for industry and commerce. If the previous order is restored, the Northeast will inevitably continue to dump and manipulate [the market], which would violate your Excellency's advocacy of national products. Moreover, our country's industry is nascent. If Northeast goods are allowed to destroy it, it would not only lead to the bankruptcy of oil factories, but also to the desperation of workers' lives. Therefore, in addition to continuously sending telegrams to the Yuan Ministry and making a request, we respectfully believe that your Excellency cares about the national economy and protects the people's livelihood. Members of the association are tearfully submitting our appeal, and we look up to your Excellency to review and quickly order the Ministry of Finance to maintain the import tax on Northeast-shipped food soybean oil as before, without changing it. This would increase the source of national tax revenue and save the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of oil industry workers. National interests and people's welfare all depend on your benevolent implementation. Looking up to the sky, we are endlessly fearful and urgently await orders.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhu Jingan, Chairman of the Shanghai Oil Pressing Industry Association</p>
<h3>Farmers in the Southern Shanghai District Request Subsidies for Transporting Night Soil</h3>
<p>The southern district of Shanghai connects to the city, and there are more than 200 night soil carts used by farmers in the area. These are all poor farmers who push and transport night soil from the city to be used as fertilizer. Therefore, although this is a cleaning job, it is completely voluntary and receives no compensation. After the January 28th Incident, the economy has not yet recovered, and this year there has been a severe drought, while the price of vegetables is very low, with green vegetables worth less than two copper coins per pound. As a result, farmers have no way to make a living. Considering that the sanitation workers receive a monthly reward from households, ranging from two dimes per household, a meeting of all cart owners was held at Jiangjing Temple in Xiaomuqiao yesterday to resolve the matter. They requested subsidies from residents to balance their incomes.</p>

<p>Car Antifreeze Should Use Domestic Planet Brand Glycerin During the severe winter, car water tanks are prone to freezing, which can lead to cracks.

<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>Seeking Good Doctors and Prescriptions Gu Futang's letter seeking a good doctor says: My wife is now 39 years old and has a history of liver yang syndrome. When it occurs, her hands and feet are numb and cold, she has dizziness and stagnation of qi, and even confusion. She has given birth eight times in total. The first five times were safe, the sixth time was a miscarriage, and the seventh time was also safe. The eighth time was in early September of the lunar calendar last year, and it was also a miscarriage. Three days after the delivery, due to a slight smell of carbon monoxide, her liver yang syndrome relapsed and became increasingly severe. After treatment with both Chinese and Western medicine, she improved slightly until this spring. By summer, she was able to sit up, move around, and her appetite improved. Later, she had several Western-style massages and more than 40 Chinese-style massages, but they were ineffective. Two months ago, she was introduced by a friend to a hospital in Pudong for treatment. Because she caught a cold in the hospital, she became heavier again. After being discharged from the hospital, she was treated by Chinese and Western doctors and ancient-style Jin Zhenke doctors, and she improved slightly. However, on the 3rd and 4th of this month, it worsened again. Her appetite is poor, she cannot sleep day or night, and her chest and abdomen are sometimes spasming, and sometimes her hypochondria are painful. Sometimes her abdomen is full and distended, causing headaches. Recently, confusion has been added, and her limbs are weak. Medication is ineffective. Both Chinese and Western doctors say that it is caused by physical deficiency and that she needs to rest in order to recover. According to the current situation, I am afraid that rest alone cannot save her. I don't know if there are any other methods. If you can give high-level guidance, or give a prescription, or indicate a famous doctor, if she can be healed as a result, then my wife and I will feel like we have been reborn.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Sir, yesterday I read the local news in your newspaper about the collision between the Continental Merchant Shipping Company's export ship and a junk outside Wusongkou. After reading it, it was inconsistent with the facts. According to the junk named Jin Liyuan, the owner of the ship is Liu Tong. The location of the collision that day was in Wusongkou, opposite Yun Cao Bang, at the northern head of the Pudong Beach Customs buoy. Furthermore, the weather was clear and there was no fog at all. This is a tragic incident involving a collision. I am sending you this letter to request your editor-in-chief to quickly correct it to clarify the truth and respect humanity. I cannot express my expectations and gratitude. Sincerely, Liu Tong, shipowner of the junk Jin Liyuan, December 21st.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Liaoning Education Decimated Under Brutal Japanese Rule</h3>
<p>No Education to Speak of in Jinpu and Other Areas of Dalian</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency, Shenyang) Since the brutal Japanese occupation of the Northeast, they have paid close attention to education. In addition to destroying the original education, they have continued it with enslaved education. The following is a summary of the educational situation in Liaoning Province.</p>
<p>(Increased School Dropout Rate in Dalian) The western part of Dalian, under the jurisdiction of the Shaohekou Police Department, including Xishan Guildhall, Xishahekou, Sanchunliu, Xianglujiao, Xinmintun, Mazhangtun, and other places, although industry and commerce are developed and it is close to Dalian City, the population has increased accordingly. The number of children enrolled in school should also have increased greatly. However, there are only two ordinary schools in the area, Xishan and Houjiagou, and the school buildings are extremely narrow and cannot accommodate all students. Therefore, the number of school-age children is increasing day by day. In the new semester of this year, the number of boys and girls volunteering to enroll in these two schools reached more than 900. Among them, only 300 were able to enter the two schools, and the remaining 600 were almost all out of school. From this, it can be seen that in Dalian, which the Japanese have occupied for a long time, the restrictions and destruction of education are because they are afraid that Chinese people will also have knowledge, and they are indeed implementing a policy of ignorance.</p>
<p>(Education in Jinpu and Other Areas) In recent years, in various elementary schools in Jinzhou, Pulandian, and other places, because there are many graduates and few secondary schools, most of them have no place to go to school and end up dropping out of school. It is found that in the new semester of this year, the number of students who graduated from various elementary schools in the state who did not get promoted was huge, exceeding the past. At the moment, those concerned about education in Pulandian, Piziwo, Jinzhou, and Lushun have specially contacted various elementary schools and other merchants, etc., and elected representatives to petition the Japanese puppet authorities, but the result is still unknown whether they will refuse or even allow the implementation of enslaved education.</p>
<h3>National Vocational Education Labor Exhibition Selects Department-Retained Achievements</h3>
<p>Vocational Education Products Stored in the Industrial Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Labor Works Stored in the Education College of Central University</p>
<p>After the closing of the National Vocational School and Elementary and Secondary School Labor Science Achievement Exhibition, from the afternoon of the 17th, representatives from various provinces and cities sorted out and packed the non-department-retained achievements. The achievements from Shanghai, Anhui, Hubei, Beiping, Qingdao, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces have already been shipped back to their respective provinces (or cities) from Beijing on the 20th. The remaining non-department-retained achievements from other provinces have been returned with representatives from each province since the 21st. It is estimated that the department-retained achievements have been organized by the staff of the Ministry of Education in recent days and have come to an end. All department-retained vocational achievements, such as more than ten pieces of machinery from Shanghai, Beiping, Hebei, and other provinces, and vocational education products from other provinces and cities, are stored in the Industrial Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Industry. The person in charge of the Ministry of Education has already opened a list for delivery on the 20th. Those retained by the Department of Labor Science achievements are stored in the Education College of Central University and will be delivered from the 21st. This time, there are more than ten thousand pieces of department-retained achievements, and they are currently rushing to prepare a list, repair the iron and wooden shelves for collecting and displaying, and restore the old view. The second step of the work will be to publish the collection of works by those with A and B ratings.</p>
<h3>China Public School Student Declaration on the Dancing Ban</h3>
<p>Advocating Actively Improving the School Environment</p>
<p>Hoping that University Students Will Automatically Remind Each Other to Abstain</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of banning university students from dancing, since the previous city education bureau issued a circular to major middle schools, it has attracted attention from all walks of life. Students from China Public School in this city specially issued a declaration to respond. The school's ethos has always been very simple and the student movement is also very active. It is heard that in order to implement their views on the issue of banning dancing, the students of the school plan to unite with schools in Shanghai to further discuss it. The contents of the declaration are excerpted as follows: Since the Union of Universities in this city proposed banning university students from dancing, newspapers have reported it, turning it into gossip, and people in society have not examined it deeply, and have arbitrarily hyped it up, as if university students are all frivolous people. This kind of mistaken view not only has the suspicion of insulting the personality of university students, but also is enough to hinder the progress of Chinese university education, and what is the adverse impact on the future of the nation? Furthermore, we university students, as intellectuals, know how to love ourselves and are especially unwilling to lightly degenerate and invite contempt. Even if there are occasional visitors to dance halls, they are only a small minority. Moreover, the infection of this bad habit is actually a reflection of social pathology. Since it is not an innate endowment, it is mostly caused by the temptation of the environment. The way to treat it is definitely not just to hold a negative ban to be effective, it depends on actively improving the school environment, subtly influencing it, guiding it according to the situation, so that students regard the dormitory as a home, in order to cultivate the habit of frugality and diligence in study. The measures stipulated in the recent letter from the City Education Bureau to the major middle schools, such as "installing friendship venues to reflect educational films, promoting proper entertainment, and strictly implementing military training," are practical ways to get to the root of the problem. "Principals and teachers of various schools must never visit dance halls" is an urgent task. I deeply hope that the authorities of various schools will lead by example and implement it effectively, so that the grass will fall when the wind blows, and the atmosphere will be able to be transformed. I, the nation's university students, tell all of our university students that university students are the foundation of the country and the nation. Our actions are a model for society. At this time of national crisis and national peril, we should especially reflect on the difficulties of the times, hone our ambitions, and strive to strengthen ourselves. Not only should we absolutely abstain from dancing to advocate for society, but also, all bad habits must be automatically abandoned and reminded of each other. If there are any deliberate violations, we should lead them as a harmful horse and abandon them with everyone, in order to establish social faith, promote the new life movement, and create a bright future for our university students themselves. The nation's revival depends on it. We are not sensitive and will definitely practice what we advocate to the end. We wish all of our students in the country to rise up together and plan for it. This is our declaration, and we hope that you will give it your consideration. More than 120 students from China Public School, Luo Yiwen, Chen Manhua, Wang Jiashu, Chen Zongli, Shui Xiangyun, Fang Youcong, Liu Jinxing, Wei Duanmin, Huang Jinhua, Huang Jinsheng, Hu Guoguang, etc.</p>

<h3>Provinces and Cities are Organizing Film Teaching Groups</h3>
<p>The China Educational Film Association has previously received a letter from the International United Association of International Educational Film Association, in order to use educational films as a teaching aid, and intends to have teachers from schools at all levels in various countries devote their time and energy to film teaching, organize film teaching groups, called "Educational Film Pioneers," and asked China to support and cooperate. The association has sent letters to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities to solicit opinions from teachers at all levels. It is now heard that various provinces and cities have replied that they are willing to organize these teaching groups. There are 23 people from Jinling University, 1 person from Hunan University, 20 people from Jiaozuo Institute of Technology, 7 people from Shandong Provincial Medical College, 3 people from Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, 3 people from Hebei Provincial Agricultural College, 8 people from Mingxian Middle School, Beiping Municipal Baozi Hutong Experimental Primary School, Liangjiayuan Primary School, Xinkailu Primary School, Haidian Primary School, and Gushan Primary School in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu, and others have varying numbers of people.

<h3>West YMCA Basketball Finals: West YMCA Defeats McTyeire</h3>
<p>33 to 24</p>
<p>No Problem Retaining the Championship</p>
<p>McTyeire Suffers Crushing Defeat in the Last Ten Minutes</p>
<p>This year's West YMCA basketball championship has once again fallen into the hands of the West YMCA. In the West YMCA vs. McTyeire finals last night, the West YMCA defeated McTyeire 33 to 24. This marks the fifth consecutive year that the West YMCA has retained the West YMCA basketball championship. Although the West YMCA still has two games against Jiangwan and St. John's, there should be no major issues. There was also one Division A game last night, with Tongji defeating Qingguang 48 to 21 (first half: 20 to 7).</p>
<p>In last night's West YMCA vs. McTyeire finals, McTyeire was in the lead until the last ten minutes. Due to人员调动 and insufficient defense, the West YMCA suddenly surged ahead and reversed the defeat into a victory. In terms of bravery and agility, the two teams were similar, but the key to victory was the West YMCA's ability to remain calm and composed and to shoot with more confidence. This was also the reason for the victory. McTyeire opened the scoring 5 to 2, and the West YMCA tied the score 6 to 6. After that, it was all McTyeire, 14 to 7, and they finished the first half 16 to 13. In the second half, the West YMCA gradually closed the gap. Smith scored several long-range shots, tying the score twice at 17 and 19. With Squiers's goal, the West YMCA took the lead 25 to 23. McTyeire's formation was thrown into disarray and could not recover. The West YMCA won by nine points, 33 to 24.</p>

<h3>Situation in the Jinan-Yuqing Incident Has Become Amicable</h3>
<p>Both Sides Reached a Reconciliation Yesterday</p>
<p>China Sports Federation to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation is scheduled to hold an emergency plenary meeting at Chih Chih School on Shuidao Road, Zhabei, at 2:00 PM today. All members of the association are required to send a formal representative to Chih Chih University by 1:30 PM. The association will not issue further notices. The following schools are expected to attend: Fudan High School, Fudan Affiliated High School, Chih Chih Affiliated High School, Shanghai College Affiliated High School, Guanghua Affiliated High School, Jinan Affiliated High School, Nanyang Commercial High School, Zhonghai Middle School, Pushu Middle School, Minli Middle School, Pudong Middle School, Minli Girls' High School, Yuqing Middle School, Chongde Girls' High School, and Aiguo Girls' High School.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of Eight Schools in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Yuqing Middle School Invites Emergency Meeting of the Eight Schools Joint Association in Jiangwan: (1) Fudan High School, (2) Tongji Vocational School, (3) Xinmin Middle School, (4) Lida School Group, (5) Southeast Women's Physical Education School, (6) Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, (7) Aiguo Girls' High School. Urgent: Our school unfortunately experienced a bloody tragedy. Students were brutally attacked by members of another school from the education sector, with six or seven people near death and more than a dozen others slightly injured and awaiting treatment. Alas, it is a tragedy! Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, students from our school participated in a football match against Jinan Affiliated High School students at Shen Garden on Jiaozhou Road at the invitation of the Secondary School Sports Federation. As a result, our school won 3-1 against Jinan. Unexpectedly, the students of Jinan Affiliated High School, in a fit of anger, immediately blew their whistles and gathered a crowd of more than 200 people who surrounded and beat our students. It appeared that they had been organized and prepared in advance, as there were large wooden boxes pre-filled with rocks and short knives and iron bars used to attack and beat our students. Chaos reigned for a time, and the crowd panicked. Our school had only about forty students with no weapons, so how could they resist the violent mob of more than 200 people? Unable to flee or fight back, six people were seriously injured and taken away by the Red Cross ambulance from Haige Road and sent to Baolong Hospital. The urgent situation cannot be described in detail. We sincerely ask the Eight Schools Joint Association in the Jiangwan area to uphold justice and provide assistance. Today (the 21st) at 9:00 AM, please send a representative to our school to discuss countermeasures. We fear that if this is allowed to continue, endless troubles will ensue. Physical education, meant to build health, has turned into a disaster. The country will perish soon. We hope you will come on time, as this is extremely urgent. Wang Hanliang, Yuqing Middle School.</p>
<h3>Yuqing Petitions the Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>According to China News Agency, Yuqing Middle School and Jinan Affiliated High School fought for the final spot in the Middle School Group of the Middle School Sports Federation at Shen Garden the other afternoon. Yuqing defeated Jinan Affiliated High School 3-1, resulting in a bloody tragedy after Jinan resorted to violence. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. More than 300 students from Yuqing Middle School went to the Municipal Bureau of Education to petition yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Section Chief Chen Bai responded that he would investigate and resolve the matter.</p>
<h3>Jinan Apologizes, Both Sides Reconcile</h3>
<p>According to another source, the cause of the incident was minor. Near the end of the game, Jinan team member Shi Yongnan accidentally kicked Yuqing player number 14 once while trying to gain possession of the ball. One side did not mean to do it, while the other side intended to retaliate. Therefore, just as the whistle blew to end the game, Yuqing player number 14 suddenly approached Shi Yongnan and kicked him violently. Jinan team member Zeng Rongzhong, fearing that this would cause trouble, ran forward to dissuade him. However, player number 14 thought that Zeng's arrival was malicious and suddenly ran towards his classmates. The cheering squads on both sides misunderstood and each showed their skills, resulting in a chaotic and tragic fight. Afterwards, two representatives from each side went to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau to report the incident. Yesterday, the Jinan authorities, fearing that the misunderstanding would deepen and the situation would escalate, and that newspapers were falsely reporting that students at the scene had knives and guns, specially sent Secretary-General Chen Rongding and Director of Education Situ [name obscured] to Yuqing to apologize and explain the misunderstanding. The physical education instructor of that school, Yu Hengzhi, also sent a separate letter to the National Sports Association to express his apologies. This disturbance has been amicably resolved after understanding between the two authorities. As for what the Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation will do about this matter, it will not be expressed until after a report is received and a meeting is convened.</p>
<h3>National Physical Education Champion, Capital Basketball Leader, Comes to Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>Sweeping the North and South, Invincible</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai on the 24th, Victory is Foreseeable</p>
<p>The Nanjing Central National Physical Education School basketball team came to Shanghai last year to challenge and returned with five wins in five games. This spring, they won the Zhongzheng Cup and the 6th League Championship, displaying great strength and earning a well-deserved reputation. During the summer vacation, they征北平津济 and were invincible. After returning to school, their technique has improved even more. And since the enrollment of Li Zhenzhong, a selected athlete of this year's Far East Games, they are like a tiger with wings.

<h3>Fudan Defeats Donghua in Friendly Football Match</h3>
<p>Result: 3-2</p>
<p>Although the Fudan University football team suffered a small setback against Jinan in the Jiangda competition, their diligent training and excellent coordination have long been praised by the people. In order to observe technology, the team specially invited the Donghua team for a friendly match at the school's playing field at 3:00 PM the other day. Donghua's主将 Jiang Lin and others all personally participated, but they lost 2-3 due to unfamiliarity with the venue and 轻敌意. The details are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>First Half: The two sides lined up, with Sui Zhongen as the referee. They were tied 2-2 for five minutes. Chen Hongzhi intercepted the ball and took it away in one kick. Zhou Dayun was unprepared for a cold shot, and it actually hit. Excited, Fudan's generals gave their orders, and Donghua repeatedly warned of danger. Yu Shunzhang knocked on the door twice, but was saved by the goalkeeper. Donghua's defenders were eager to protect the goal and even used their hands to kiss the ball. Yu Shunzhang took the penalty kick, and the阿斗 entered the net in response. Was Donghua weak? Center Dai led the troops and launched a counterattack, but they failed because they acted too hastily. Soon, Fudan was awarded a corner kick, and the kick came at just the right time. Xu Jingcheng welcomed it with his head, and it hit again. After this, Fudan 全军突进. Yu Shunzhang lightly挑, and Gong Ziwen received assistance. He flew横扫 from 20 yards away. The posture was beautiful, the ball went as fast as an arrow, and goalkeeper Fan was caught off guard. The ball went into the net, and 四座掌声如雷. After that, you came and I went, and the first half ended.</p>
<p>Second Half: After the lemon time, the two sides switched sides to fight. Donghua pushed zero and was咄咄逼人, but they failed because the shooting was not accurate and they missed the opportunity. In an instant, Li Yichen dribbled deep, raised his foot and shot from 15 yards away. Fortunately, Zhou Dayun was able to save the situation. But Fudan's bad luck turned into good luck. With beautiful and rapid short passes, they倾师突攻. Donghua's position was in a dangerous state. In the last five minutes, they forced a corner kick. Lu Xiuwen开球得法, and Tang Xiangan kicked a goal in the乱军中, which sealed the victory. Donghua still wanted to fight back, but time did not wait for them. The silver whistle sounded, and it ended there. Fudan won 3-2.</p>
<p>双方球员综合 The war is the best combination and the best. The winner is not lucky.</p>
<p>观 Both players have their own strengths and weaknesses. Li Ning and Chen Hongguang are brave and good at fighting. Li Yichen's middle back is not suitable. The passing of Dai Zhongfeng is quite clever. There are some advantages to the rear guards Guan Zhang and the forwards Yu Shunzhang and Gong Ziwen, but unfortunately the two wings are weaker. The formations of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan Team</p>
<p>Weng Renan Lu Xiuwen</p>
<p>Zhang Rong Gong Ziwen</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun An Lesheng Yu Shunzhang</p>
<p>Guan Zhuanan Tang Xianzhen</p>
<p>Li Changchi Yang Ronghua</p>
<p>Donghua Team</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang Yang Renwei</p>
<p>Li Ning Lu Chali (down) Yin Zhengda (up)</p>
<p>Fan Jiaju Li Yichen (up) Li Yichen (down)</p>

<h3>Awards Given Yesterday for the Third Municipal Secondary School Joint Games</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Addressed the Ceremony and Presented Awards</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education held the awards ceremony for the third Municipal Secondary School Sports Meeting at the City Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu, Director Pan [name obscured], Huang Zaoxiong, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, Ma Chongyu, Shao Rudong, Wang Keyong of the Education Bureau, and more than 100 athletes from various schools attended. The chairman was Pan Gongzhan, and the master of ceremonies was Yuan Zengyu. Mayor Wu gave a speech and presented the awards. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: First, Chairman Pan Bureau Chief reported, stating that today is the awards ceremony for the third Municipal Secondary School Sports Meeting. 本届运动会参加田径者七十七校运动員九○九人、团體操三十三校三十七节、会操三十五校二千七百人、总计参加五千四百余人、其人数及成绩均较过去进步. This year, 77 schools participated in track and field with 909 athletes, 33 schools participated in gymnastics with 37 sections, and 35 schools participated in team exercises with 2,700 people, for a total of more than 5,400 participants. Both the number of participants and the results have improved compared to the past. Today's award ceremony is just to encourage middle school students to pay attention to Physical Health, and it is not what the sports meeting focuses on. Therefore, those with poor grades should not be discouraged, but should continue to practice. What is especially important is that athletes must have sportsmanship, noble character, and restrain themselves from engaging in out-of-bounds behavior. They must recognize that trophies are just a tool, and improving Physical Health is the goal. In the past, unfortunate incidents have often occurred, such as yesterday's soccer game, where fights broke out. This kind of improper means and irregular methods are a disgrace. Everyone must encourage each other so that such wrong actions do not occur, etc.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address: Next, Mayor Wu gave a speech, saying: According to Director Pan's report just now, this year's results have improved compared to previous years, which is very gratifying. Students often hear me say that China's hope lies in the youth of China today, and China's destiny rests on the youth of today. Therefore, I have great hope for the youth, so I cannot help but constantly supervise and urge them, hoping that you can prepare everything in your youth so that you can shoulder the great responsibility of the country in the future. China has a long history of more than 4,000 years, a population of 440 million, and a vast land and abundant resources, which are unmatched by other countries. Therefore, China's future prospects are very promising. Today's youth are the rising stars, the awakened youth. If they can work hard and prepare their knowledge and skills, I believe that one day they will definitely be able to turn China from weak to strong. Director Pan also said just now that athletes often engage in out-of-bounds behavior. We know that sports are not only Physical Education, but also cultivate a selfless spirit and consider the interests of the team, not just one's own. This kind of spirit must be cultivated during student days, so that when serving in society in the future, one will not be selfish, etc. Then, Huang Zaoxiong, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, hoping to (1) Popularize Physical Education so that every student can participate in sports and have a healthy body; (2) In addition to sports, military training should also be emphasized, etc.</p>

<h3>Financial Rumors of Issuing Stabilization Bonds Send Gold Price Above 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Closing Price: 1,002 Yuan</p>
<p>Increase: 10 Yuan 3 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market once again surged due to inflationary concerns, unexpectedly breaking through the 1,000 yuan mark. After multiple long and short positions, the trading volume on the market was surprisingly low. However, the foreign exchange market was tight in the morning session, and the gold market was affected by expensive overnight interest rates and rumors of rising interest rates. In the early morning, although the silver markets in England and the United States rose, it was within expectations. Although the forward silver market in Montreux rose, it was not significant, and foreign exchange rates slightly decreased. The spot gold price in London decreased by one penny. The off-market pre-market trading opened at 992 yuan, but was immediately pulled up due to strong buying interest. The central bank's exchange rate announcement showed the pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar decreasing by 0.0625. The customs gold unit fell by one li, and the standard gold price was announced as 1,005.5 yuan. However, the opening price was still high. After the opening, the price rose because banks were eager to buy, but sellers were not yet active, and the price once fell. However, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's exchange rates for the British and American currencies remained unchanged, and HSBC was aggressively buying shillings, and Maijia Li was also buying U.S. dollars. The tight foreign exchange market affected people's sentiment, and the price gradually rose. However, because banks seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, and overnight interest rates rose to 4 jiao, the money supply was still tight. Buyers' sentiment seemed to be hit, and they were eager to supply at high prices, causing the price to fall back. The white silver stabilization tax was announced at 25, calculated at 6.5 percent. The British exchange rate was calculated at one shilling, five pence, and 375, and remained stable. Before long, HSBC bought British gold again, and buyers were particularly eager to buy, causing the price to rise again. However, those who seized the opportunity to sell at high prices did not disappear, and banks also seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, causing the price to fall again after rising. Finally, there were limited traders in the market, and the domestic market in banks was calm, resulting in a sluggish and lingering situation. This was because the rumor of a 30 million yuan loan was still circulating, and the potential for growth in the morning session ultimately felt weak. The afternoon session opened weak, and large investors gradually entered the market at low prices, allowing the price to be maintained. The first report from Mumbai showed a decrease of six anna, stabilizing the situation. Demand exceeded supply in the market, but because banks seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, there was still resistance. Later, the second decrease from Mumbai by one anna maintained the trend. Rumors of issuing stabilization bonds spread, causing the price to rise. However, there was still fluctuation due to profit-taking at high prices. Later, the foreign exchange market tightened slightly, and buying interest in the market revived. The rumor that the central bank would issue 10 million yuan in non-convertible stabilization bonds spread widely, stirring up a wave of price increases, and the trading volume on the market was surprisingly low. The non-convertible paper money was a formal expansion policy, immediately exciting people's sentiment, and unexpectedly breaking through the 1,000 yuan mark, with a strong upward trend. Finally, the situation was uncertain due to settlement relations. After the close, large investors gradually sold off, and supply was particularly abundant, causing the price to fall back within the 1,000 yuan mark. The trading volume during the day was mediocre, and the swap spread was about 13 or 14 yuan due to the high overnight interest rates. The market conditions for the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 992.8 yuan, 1.1 yuan higher than the previous closing. Da Fa Yong Wanhsing took the lead, rising to 4 yuan. Huixiang and Xing Yongheng came to sell, and the price fell back to 1.7 yuan. It was learned that HSBC's exchange rates for the British and American currencies remained unchanged, and the situation was peaceful at this time, hovering for a long time. Huabi bought January U.S. dollars at 5.625. Dingkang, Dadecheng, Hengxing, Zhaofeng, Changda, Dafa, Yongheng, Yu Fuchang, etc. entered, and the foreign exchange market was surprisingly tight, and the gold market rose. Before long, the January U.S. dollars at 5.625 were difficult to settle, and the price rose to 4.7 yuan. Wanxing and Yifeng Yong sold off, and the price once fell to 3.6 yuan. However, HSBC bought shillings again, and Maijia Li bought March U.S. dollars at 32.9375, and it was difficult to settle again. People's sentiment was pulled up, and Dadecheng, Xing Yong, Yongfeng Hengyuanyuan, Kangxiang, Yuanyuan Mao Yong, etc. entered one after another, and the price rose to 6.1 yuan. Senchang Yong, Wanxing Hanheng, etc. came to sell off, and the overall situation was difficult to improve, gradually falling back to 4.3 yuan. At this time, the white silver stabilization tax was announced, rising by 25, and the situation remained stable. However, because the British pound came out, the January U.S. dollars were at 4.375. The situation fluctuated at this time. Later, because HSBC bought February shillings at 125, people's sentiment was not unaffected. Hengyu took the opportunity to buy aggressively, and the trading volume was exhausted, finally rising to 6.3 yuan. Shengda Hengxing, Chunyuan Yong, and Dakang came to sell at high prices. Huabi came out, the January shillings were at 25, and gradually fell back to 4.3 yuan. Hengyu was still entering, and Dafa Yong Fuxing Yong also had buying interest, rising back to 6 yuan. Fuxing Yong Dingchang, etc. took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and people's sentiment was uncertain, and the price fell back to 4.2 yuan again. After that, the trading volume was limited, and the supply and demand in the market was mediocre. The foreign exchange market was also extremely calm, so Hengyu Hengxing and Zhentai were on the buying side, and Dingkang Chang was selling. Fuxing Yong, etc. were uncertain, and the market price hovered around 5 yuan thereafter, with no special changes. The closing price at noon was 994.9 yuan. After the close, the situation was slightly weak. Hengxing, etc. sold slightly, but there were no opponents, and retail investors rushed to sell off.</p>
<p>The afternoon session opened at 994.3 yuan. Yuanyuan Kangxiang Hengchang Yong sold off, falling to 3.8 yuan. Hengxing Dachang Xiang Dafa Yong Fuxing Yong Hongkang Yong Bingxing Fuyu were continuously short, and Mumbai also had a small decline of 6.6 anna, rising to 5.7 yuan. Hengyu sold off, and Jiaotong closed February shillings at 0.0625, falling to 5.1 yuan. Qingyu Fuxing Yong Dafa Yong, etc. continued to enter, rising to 6 yuan. Citibank came out, the March U.S. dollars were at 875, Yuanchang Yong Hengxing supplied, falling to 5.2 yuan. After the entry, although Qianchang Xiang sold, Zhifu Xing Yong Dadecheng entered, and the struggle was particularly fierce. The second Indian silver report was down by a small 1.1 anna, and people's sentiment was still good. The rumor of non-convertible stabilization bonds spread, and Yongli Dadecheng Dafa Yong, etc. entered to 7.8 yuan. Shengda Fuxing Yong took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and then fell to 6.6 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market continued to tighten, and the March shillings were already trading at 875. In addition, the rumor that the central bank would issue 10 million yuan in non-convertible stabilization bonds spread widely, and the trading volume was exhausted. Dadecheng Yifeng Yong Yuanyuan Maoyong Fuyu Shen Tianfeng Zhentai Yicheng Yuanchang Yong Hengxing Yuan Fuxing Yong Hongli, etc. jointly competed to buy, unexpectedly breaking through the 1,000 yuan mark, rising to 1,003 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxing Yong vigorously sold off, falling to 0.06 yuan. However, the price raisers were extremely brave, and Dafa Yong Fuyu Yuanchang Yong also entered, and the closing price was 1,002 yuan. After the close, Fuxing Yong Fuyu Dadecheng Yuanyuan Maoyong Yifeng Yong Yicheng, etc. jointly vigorously sold off, causing a sudden drop, once falling to 999 yuan. Bingxing Yong, etc. took advantage of the low price to report that the market had stabilized. It was found that the highest price during the day was 1,003 yuan, and the lowest price was 991.7 yuan, with a difference of 11.3 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 10.3 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was about 3 yuan less than the central bank's standard price of 1,005.5 yuan, about 11 yuan less than the previous closing. The January ledger was 979 yuan, February was 986 yuan, and February was 1,002 yuan. The supplementary water in the afternoon was 981 yuan. The price of pure gold was still 12 yuan less than the forward standard, and the listed price was 980.8 yuan. The spot market was calm, lacking formal transactions. The spot price was 8 yuan less than the forward standard, which was the buying price, and the selling price was 3 yuan less. The swap was more expensive due to the higher overnight interest rates, and it was 4 jiao, so the long side was happy to pay the premium, and there was a lack of sellers. In the morning, Hengxing Fuchang Wanxing, etc. were inclined to pay a premium at the 12 yuan mark, but there were no opponents, because a small number of short positions limited the price to 13.5 yuan, and large short positions limited the premium to 14 yuan. Later, Yuanyuan Maoyong paid Huixiang 14, and Hengxing 7, both at 13.5 yuan. After the entry, it was still difficult to pay a premium at 13.8 yuan. There were 6,370 January notes left, with a total of 39 long positions and 16 short positions.</p>
<p>There were few transactions in the market, and the situation was chaotic. Zhaofeng Chang Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Qianchang Xiang Yicheng Senchang Yong Dingchang Wanxing Hengxing Hanheng, etc. were on the selling side, and Hengyu Tianfeng Dachang Xiang Qingyu Zhentai Yuxin Xiang Chang Yuli Huifu Shenkang Hongli, etc. were on the buying side. Fuxing Yong Dafa Yong Yicheng Wanxing Yuanyuan Maofu Yusen Chang Yong entered first and then exited, and Yuanchang Yong Hengchang Yong Huixiang Hengyu exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang Wanxing traded about 1,000, and squeezed out about 200. Shunli traded more than 400, and the squeezed out position was flat. The Guangdong gang Shengda Hengxing had few transactions, and the squeezed out position was slightly sold out. The total number of transactions on the day was 23,380 in the morning session and 22,246 in the afternoon session. The number of February chips was 28,063, with a total of 62 long positions and 57 short positions.</p>

The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's exchange rates for the British and American currencies remained unchanged, and the bank's appetite was trending upward, and it immediately became tight.

<h3>Spot Exchange Rate Suddenly Rises by Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign currency was still 840 yuan in the morning market, and the situation in the noon market was favorable, suddenly rising by 10 yuan to 850 yuan. As a result, it rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous day, and the transaction was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong small foreign currency has been rising for more than ten days since it has been rising continuously, and the situation is very healthy. At that time, it was expected that it must break through the 800 yuan mark, but although yesterday's transaction was still not bad, because there were still many goods arriving from various places in the mainland, the market atmosphere has led to a decline. The morning market opened and fell by 2 yuan to 767 yuan. The noon market continued to fall to 764.5 yuan. As a result, it fell by 3.5 yuan compared to the previous day, and the transaction was 150,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were 300,000 wen, an increase of 4,000 wen compared to the previous day. The transaction amount was 8,200 strings of wen, equivalent to 9,400 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities Long-Short Swap, Public Debt Fluctuations Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, because there were only two or three days left for the futures in this month, the long-short swap transactions were quite active. No. 16 was the wide-head swap or supplement, No. 41 was the long-head swap, and the rest of the scattered swaps were not lonely. Therefore, although the foreign currency overnight interest rate increased to four jiao, the trend was still very strong, and the number of buyers gradually increased. Short covering such as Nos. 48 and 53 was also considerable. Although the money supply was tight, it was a temporary phenomenon. Retail investors bought and arbitraged because it was more generous and stable than ordinary deposit interest rates, so this type of transaction also accounted for a part of the power, and the future can be stable. In the past yesterday, the morning opening was because the foreign currency overnight interest rate continued to rise, and there were quite a few sales, and the front row slightly decreased by two or three jiao. After the entry, because the large short position of No. 16 was slightly hedged, people's sentiment turned to rise, so the rear row rose by one or two jiao, and the whole six were uniquely good at four jiao. In the second round, short positions continued to be hedged and swapped, and the market price uniformly returned to strong, mostly increasing by five points, one jiao to four jiao. Nos. 48 and 53 had stronger buying interest on the market, while Nos. 4 and 11 had sales. In the afternoon opening, No. 41 was a long-head swap, No. 16 was a short-head swap, and Nos. 14 and 38 also had sales, and the trend became chaotic again, with highs and lows mixed. Only reorganization was uniquely good at four jiao, and the rest fluctuated by one or two jiao. There were still many swap transactions at the closing, and the market price was slightly tired by one or two jiao to three jiao. The trends and prospects were mostly based on the relationship between the more or less chips, and they were mutually squeezed out, but most of them have been prepared, so the fluctuations have been limited. The market price results were mostly mixed, and the number was only two or three jiao. The situation seemed to be more squeezing out short positions than squeezing out long positions, so most of them were high near and low far. The total number of transactions was 21.54 million yuan, and the comparison table of the rise and fall results is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>New York Gas Stock Falls Sharply</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (20th), the Wall Street market was stable, and public utilities stocks created a low record since 1932. New York Gas fell to 20 yuan, the new low price for this year. Dow Jones Financial News Agency commented on this matter, saying that the investment position of this stock is extremely broad, including trust companies, churches, and women, so it is especially unfortunate. Transportation stocks were lowered by a large number of sales, industrial and railway stocks were still strong, store stocks were trending higher, the bond market was mixed, U.S. government bonds softened, foreign government bonds were quite strong, and small exchange stocks also rose and fell. Chicago wheat was almost unchanged, and the total number of transactions throughout the day was 880,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>New Yarn Buyers Handling This Month's Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market is again showing signs of a premium, as new buyers are taking delivery this month. Consequently, the near-term market has been particularly strong, and the long-term market has also been stimulated. Tung Shing Company and a certain cotton firm have absorbed a large number of packages but are not releasing them. However, foreign firms with short positions are also firmly refusing to cover, so the market has become deadlocked. Nevertheless, most people are unwilling to sell off rashly.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Relatively Strong Recently; Opening Bids for Traded Yarn</h3>
<p>In the morning session, due to Mr. Wu planning to take delivery of 1,000 bales this month, market sentiment was firm. Today, it is said that money shops are also buying in, and Tianjin firms are actively covering shorts. Therefore, the market for this month is particularly strong, rising by one yuan. However, the long-term market is flat because the current yarn sales market is sluggish and there are fewer buyers. The afternoon opening bids were still flat. However, by the third closing, some short positions were covered. It was also heard that the price of gold had risen again to over 1,000 yuan, rebounding by 2.3.4.5 jiao. The sales were: Tongfu 700 bales, Daji 900 bales, Yu Chang 850 bales, Shenji 600 bales, Dafu 1,050 bales, Mingde 950 bales, Tongxing 400 bales, and Xincheng 2,000 bales. The purchases were: Tongji 500 bales, Yuda 650 bales, Dafeng 650 bales, Shenchang 1,700 bales, Renfeng 1,100 bales, Yicheng 400 bales, Hengyi 400 bales, Yuanyi 600 bales, and Yufeng 800 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Traded Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Account Balance</p>
<p>December 184.0 183.4 183.7 Up 0.7 019,930</p>

<p>May 190.2 189.8 190.1 0.2 024,950</p>
<p>Total 2 2,000</p>
<h3>No Development in Actual Sales</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales are slightly slow. It is estimated that 647 bales were bought by various firms throughout the day, with prices rising by 2.5 jiao. The purchase amounts for each firm are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 10 Jiangxi Yunnan 100 Jiangxi 5</p>
<p>Ningbo 2 Inland 135 Sichuan 65</p>
<p>Guangdong 235 Changsha 75 Northern Firms 20</p>
<h3>Insufficient Delivery of Goods; Cotton Prices Rise Consistently in Near and Distant Terms</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward because the delivery period for this month is approaching, and short sellers have not been able to deliver enough goods. It is said that only 5,700 dan of cotton have passed inspection. It is estimated that more than 70,000 dan have been traded long and short this month. Therefore, general floating accounts are covering, and the market has turned upward, with distant futures also rising. The price of gold has also broken through the 1,000 yuan barrier.</p>
<h3>Scattered Accounts Covering in Zheng Standard Futures</h3>
<p>Opening bids for traded cotton in the morning session showed mixed ups and downs for American cotton, while Indian cotton rose by one rupee. Sellers of domestic cotton are scarce, and delivery for this month is still insufficient. Scattered accounts are covering, and market sentiment is relatively strong. This month's price rose by 2 jiao, and distant futures rose by 5 fen. In the afternoon, it was heard that Japanese firms had good overseas cotton yarn export transactions and were making some purchases of raw materials, causing people to become more anxious. The price of gold rose again to 1,002 yuan, and prices for all months rose by 5 fen to 1.5 jiao and 2.5 jiao. The sales were: Yuanda 1,400 dan, Dafu 4,600 dan, Gengfeng 1,000 dan, Shenchang 1,100 dan, Runkang 2,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,100 dan, Changhe 4,400 dan, Yuanyi 1,700 dan, Shengyuan 3,800 dan, and Xincheng 3,500 dan. The purchases were: Tongxing 1,100 dan, Jifeng 1,100 dan, Dafeng 8,600 dan, Changji 1,100 dan, Renfeng 1,100 dan, Changfeng 4,100 dan, Chong'an 1,200 dan, Gengfeng 4,500 dan, Runkang 1,400 dan, Yikang 1,600 dan, and Xinheng 1,300 dan.

<h3>Gradual Activation of Demand from Current Cotton Factories</h3>

<h3>American Cotton Flat and Weak; Indian Cotton Slightly Up</h3>
<h3>| American Cotton's Tenth Ginning Report Released |</h3>
<p>Opening bids for American cotton yesterday showed ups and downs of 3 points for each month. Long positions for January were shifted to distant months. Demand from traders was very good, and foreign firms also made purchases. Market prices were mixed and inactive. Deliveries were not high, and stockpiled cotton was not sold off. Later, due to increased exports, market conditions turned firm. Demand for spot cotton was sluggish, and factories hoped for lower prices, but sellers were firm and unwilling to concede. The textile industry was relatively active, and the close was firm. Spot prices were unchanged, futures prices fell by 1 to 3 points in the near term, and rose by 1 to 3 points in the distant term. English spot cotton rose by 2 points, and futures rose by 4 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by market operators. Pingguo'er rose by 2.5 jiao, Aomula rose by 7.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.475 rupees. Original telegram recorded left (20th telegram)</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Markets See Reduced Factory Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, the market for each month presented a relatively stable appearance. The quoted prices for foreign wheat ranged from a little over a quarter to less than a quarter, depending on whether it was from Chicago or Canada. At the opening, because the delivery date for this month was approaching, many outside longs were engaging in liquidation, so the opening price showed a softening trend. Trading in distant months was very light, temporarily showing mutual restraint. (The outlet for current flour from northern firms is still active.) Approaching the afternoon opening, trading in each month was still not brisk. Factory chips were uncertain due to undelivered foreign wheat, so they were selling less. The market trend showed no improvement, but it was also difficult to decline. It remained hovering as usual. Recently, customer sales have shown signs of fatigue. This month fell by 1 fen, January fell by 1 fen and 2 li, February fell by 7.5 li, March fell by 1 fen, April fell by 2.5 li, and May was unchanged.</p>
<p>Flour trading is suspended from today until the 26th of this month for national accounting. Normal trading will resume on January 3rd of next year.</p>
<h3>Longs Liquidate for This Month's Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the morning opening, the market for each month generally presented a flat and weak state. The quoted prices for foreign wheat ranged from a little over a quarter to less than eight fen. Trading in each month was still sluggish at the morning opening, with prices slightly lower than the previous day by 1 or 2 fen. By the afternoon opening, because delivery was approaching, longs for this month were liquidating one after another, while hedgers mostly watched and did not move, so prices became looser. This situation is really due to the year-end closing, reducing speculation inside and outside the industry. As a result, this month fell by 4 fen, January fell by 5 fen, and February fell by 2 fen. Because traders have not acted, the current wheat market is still inactive.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grains Exchange will close its books according to the Gregorian calendar. Trading for this month's wheat will be suspended until the 26th, while trading for all other distant months will be suspended until the 29th of this month. Normal trading will resume on January 3rd of next year.</p>
<p>The winter wheat planting area in Chicago is estimated at 44,360,000 acres, with crop conditions at 77.8% of normal. New wheat from Australia and Argentina will soon be exported in large quantities. Although the market will not experience a major reaction, buyers are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

<h3>Year-End Erie Rice Prices Slightly Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw weak demand for spot goods from both local and customer appetites, hindered by the year-end closing and the relationship with silver. However, futures were strong both domestically and locally, because autumn harvests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were not good this year, and many hoarders were hoping for good prices. However, foreign merchants were also actively selling off, and the pressure to sell was even stronger recently. Yesterday, they opened up to sell 1,400 tons of broken rice and 100 tons of returned small rice. In addition, they also telegraphed from Yaxing regarding the eggplant rice from Lan Huang, estimated to have 2,000 tons of rough rice for February at a price of 4 yuan and 6 jiao and 6 fen, and 1,500 tons of polished rice for March at a price of 5 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen. Because the combined price was both cheap and suited the tastes of the domestic market and Shaoyong, it attracted the attention of the industry. It is said that it had already been distributed domestically and locally in the afternoon. Currently, 800 packages of foreign rice have been opened, and customer glutinous rice is popular locally. 8,760 packages have been opened, and the market price has weakened slightly by 3 to 5 fen due to the year-end.</p>
<h3>Significant Return of Bran</h3>
<p>The bran market is slightly weak, because foreign firms have been inactive recently, while the sales appetite of domestic firms has been active. However, the return of goods has caused prices to reverse and weaken. Fuxin current bran is quoted at 2 yuan and 7 jiao net, and miscellaneous brands of bran are quoted at 2 yuan and 7 jiao with deduction.</p>
<h3>Soybean Sales Market Increasingly Expanding</h3>
<h3>| Sesame Foreign Firm Prices Fall by Half a Jiao |</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybeans remained stable and firm. Local factories, seeing the strong soybean appetite of firms in Xichang, fearing that the market would rise, purchased over 8,000 packages of Guisui soybeans, with prices reaching 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 7 fen. Xichang took 1,600 packages at a price of 3 yuan and 5 jiao and a half. Over 3,000 packages of Hankou Zha soybeans were opened, with prices ranging from 3 yuan, 3 jiao and 7 to 3 jiao and a half, which were divided between Xichang and the local market. 1,400 packages of Hankou cart soybeans were opened, which were also taken by Xichang. Guangdong firms purchased 1,600 packages of Niuzhuang Bai Mei soybeans, with prices ranging from 4 yuan, 1 jiao to 05 fen. The local market purchased 150 packages of large Dayu soybeans, with a price of 4 yuan and 3 jiao, and 200 packages of Han soybeans, with a price of 3 yuan and 2 jiao and 8, and market prices rose by 3 to 4 fen from the previous market. If purchases continue, and sources decrease, the prospects are optimistic. Sesame prices from foreign firms continued to fall by half a jiao. Sassoon took 500 packages at a price of 9 yuan and 05 fen. The main reason is the tight silver situation, and merchants are selling cheaply, so it is feared that the market will not easily recover within the year. Spot trading in the market is also light, and market prices have fallen by another 4 to 5 fen. It is estimated that Eastern firms took over 470 packages of Guide sesame, with a price of 6 yuan and 6 jiao, and 150 packages of Australian sesame, with a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao. The local market took 60 packages of Liuhe sesame, with a price of 6 yuan, 3 jiao and a third.</p>
<h3>Pitou French Twill Japanese Goods Sell Well</h3>
<p>The sales of French twill are currently at their most prosperous time. Thick wool coats all need to be lined with it, and the selling price is also at its best. Recently, with the influx of Japanese goods, prices have reversed and decreased. The Ai 277 brand has already dropped from 5 jiao to 4 jiao and 8 and a half fen, because 20 packages of Japanese French twill were imported last week, and the price per yard dropped from 4 jiao to 3 jiao and 7 fen. Most Western-style tailors are purchasing and using it, so the Ai 277 brand has also had to lower its price. However, the selling price of domestic French twill remains unchanged. Hongsheng goods are still sold at 4 jiao, and miscellaneous second-grade goods are sold at 4 yards per package.</p>
<h3>Hardware Galvanized Iron Tile Bottom Goods in a Panic</h3>
<p>Galvanized iron tiles are necessary for building houses. Large warehouses and railway buildings all need to use them. Every time the plum rain season arrives, the outlet for this product is sure to be very prosperous. However, this year, it is the exact opposite, because the weather is dry, and the market in various places is not good, so the outlet has suffered a major blow. The goods that various firms have pre-ordered are arriving one after another, and there is a worry of being full of goods. Standard Bank, although traders are trying to maintain it, but it finally goes downstream. At this time, those who hold goods suffer severely, and dare not order goods at all, so no spot goods have arrived since April and May. However, the local inventory is sold daily and monthly, and the bottom goods are in short supply. Therefore, those who want to order from each industry have a sigh of being unable to buy goods. Now I will record the various colors below.</p>
<p>(No. 24) Although the inventory of this product is still relatively abundant, the cost is extremely large, so traders are extremely unwilling to lower the price, and there is no sign of a decrease. The price is estimated at 11 yuan and 4 jiao per load. It is estimated that over 200 loads were traded yesterday, which were dismantled from Hongkou. It is heard that they were bought by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Engineering Department. The market inventory is still 2,780 loads. If no goods arrive within the year, it is feared that it will also be out of stock next spring.</p>
<p>(No. 26) This product is already out of stock on the market. It is estimated that only Yitiehang and Xinrenchang Hardware Store are holding this product. The market price is estimated at 12 yuan and 6 jiao and a half per load, which is 2 jiao and a half better than the previous day. It is heard that buyers are still absorbing, and the trend is continuing to improve.</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Poor Woman Can't Be Different, So She's Allowed to Teach, Looking at the Western Teacher as an Equal, Not Enough, Empty Insult, Empty Heart</p>
<p>Jia Duocai felt that for such a refugee woman, her value was no more than that of an insect. To love her and shower her with affection, or to hate her and sink her into the abyss, it didn't matter. However, these two Germans coming to visit was not something to be taken lightly. It wasn't necessarily that he valued the Germans so much, but because having foreigners come to visit could raise his own status. It was often said that foreigners looked down on Chinese people, so a special, admiring visit meant that they thought highly of him, and that elevated his status. Thinking this way, he couldn't help but be extremely happy. He immediately took it upon himself to tidy the teapots, teacups, and cigarette holders on the table, arranging them neatly on a small table to the side. He opened his suitcase, took out a white cloth bundle to spread on the table, creating a tablecloth. He also placed a wire basket and stacked a few old Chinese novels in Western binding on the corner of the table. Since he didn't have things like a fountain pen or blue ink in his temporary quarters, he put a few pencils and Western-style envelopes beside the books to create the impression of an office setup and a scholarly atmosphere. However, just a few books weren't enough to show how great his learning was, so he opened his suitcase again and took out the forms that the bank had ordered him to fill out, placing them on the table as well. Fortunately, these were all in Chinese characters, which could awe the foreigners for a while. How would they know what the contents were? After making these preparations, he called the tea boy to sweep the floor and dust the bedding. Only then did he sit down calmly and murmur a few English phrases he had learned more than ten years ago, such as "How do you do," reciting them to himself. Fortunately, they were Germans, and their English probably wouldn't be very good either. As long as he could handle a few sentences himself to show that he could also speak a foreign language, that would be enough. As he was practicing his diplomatic etiquette in the room, he heard a series of mixed-up leather shoe sounds outside the window. He thought that these must be the foreign guests, so he calmed down and waited quietly for them to enter. (96)</p>
<h3>Remnants</h3>
<p>— By Chen Liang</p>
<p>Because I am also a member of the weak in this world, I symbolize with the lament and elegy of people for the miserable insect chirping. However, the insect noises have long been silent, and only the cold wind is demonstrating outside the paper window. This is a cold and serious season! When the morning dew solidifies into frost, all insects are either frozen to death or hibernating. However, in my chaotic small building, there is still a "Call Brother" hiding in the paper-covered bamboo strips. Regarding the remnants of insects, from childhood until now, I have had a heart that cherishes small insects.</p>
<p>I remember that the summer, which was suitable for the survival of "Call Brother," had passed. It still remained under the eaves of Yinggu's house. When the afternoon sunlight shone on the window screen for a moment, I would always hear that remnant faint life fluttering its wings and making a desperate wail in her house while reading books or newspapers, slowly crawling in the bamboo cage, and occasionally extending two front legs out of the empty cracks. The emerald green wings had turned brown. 'Can't you extend its life a little longer? Find a way to rescue the weak from the harsh season!' I asked Yinggu to move it from under the eaves to the inner room, and then wrap it in a layer of leather paper to give it a suitable temperature.</p>
<p>Although Yinggu did what I said, she always laughed at me for being a little foolish, thinking that the life of something as small as an insect was not worth such care, and that the weak should only be destroyed in the environment (?).</p>
<p>The weather was getting colder day by day, and I could no longer hear the chirping of "Call Brother" in Yinggu's house. I opened the wrapped leather paper to look at the cage, and it stayed still like a specimen. Later, it quietly crawled again, but stopped again after a while. So, I knew that this tiny life would be destroyed sooner or later. I couldn't care about Yinggu's ridicule, and I wanted to take it to my own small building. I filled the cage with cotton and pasted two layers of leather paper around it, leaving only a small hole to let the air flow. I put it in a warm place, so that it could supposedly endure the coming winter.</p>
<p>It is now the progressive period of the cold and serious season, but there is still a weak insect hibernating in my chaotic small building. It is a comfort to me to transform the environment for the weak and extend their lives.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— (Boguang)</p>
<p>(Odds and Ends) Mr. ×× gave a speech advocating saving the country with homespun cloth and received enthusiastic applause from the audience. After the meeting, Mr. ×× returned home, saying he would take off his homespun cloth gown and put on a stylish Western suit and leather shoes to go on a date with his lover. This is the most brilliant person in Chinese society!</p>
<p>Central Committee member Wu Zhihui said, "Chinese people only have mouths and no butts; they can all talk but can't do." This sentence is really correct. (Boguang)</p>
<h3>Fire Prison</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>"Isn't this a living hell on earth!"</p>
<p>Every time I passed by those blacksmith shops, I thought like this. No matter the season, their iron-smelting furnaces were always red. Although the furnace was red, everything else was black. The shop base was especially lower than others. When you sat down, the ground was completely black mud. The corners of the walls were piled with many iron rods and iron heads. The tables and chairs were mostly placed diagonally and haphazardly, as if they had been sprayed with black paint. When the experienced partner picked up a red-hot iron cake from the furnace and placed it on the iron pier, a young apprentice immediately came and hammered it in turns with a large hammer. Sparks flew into the air, falling on their feet and on the forehead of the apprentice who was sitting there pulling the bellows. Iron filings turned into dust, flying around everywhere. It was difficult to recognize everyone's faces. Coal dust replaced snow cream and skin care products, dyeing their hair, ears, eyes, noses, and mouths with a layer of gray-black mist. Fortunately, the weather is cold today, and working by this hot furnace is a good place to ward off the cold. You haven't seen their suffering in the scorching heat of summer - bare-chested and wearing shorts, their eyes emitting red light, coarse veins bulging on their faces, and sweat steaming from their bodies. Smoke ash and coal dust took the opportunity to attack and occupy everyone's bodies. That is suffering! That is living torment!</p>
<p>Now it is only the beginning of the cold season, but the hands of the young partners in the iron shop are already red and swollen. It's the same to make a living, but some are as happy as ascending to heaven, while others are as miserable as falling into hell. The entertainment venues of people do not have the footprints of this group of pitiful people, who only work hard and suffer in the fire prison all day long. When I pass by those iron shops, I always think uneasily for a while.</p>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>Fellows, we still have a hurdle to overcome</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Long Zhong</p>
<p>On an auspicious day, I sat at home and heard the passing musicians playing trumpets and drums on the street, making a lively sound. Walking on the street, I also saw more than a dozen red-letter lanterns lined up in front of the restaurants, their lights shining brightly, creating a great atmosphere. At this time, I suddenly wondered: how many good matches are made on each so-called auspicious day? How many unhappy couples are created? How many lovers happily become family members? And how many people's chastity will be violated? I remember that the Christian, Romulus, once said: "Marriage is at least a sin!" I feel that there is also great truth in that.</p>
<p>Seeing an advertisement in the newspaper for a company recruiting clerks, I thought again that this time, I don't know how many dozens, or even hundreds, of "bookworms" will taste the bitterness of disappointment!</p>
<p>Visiting the municipal zoo, I immediately had a thought: humans are also a kind of object. Why not lock them in iron cages and display them with foxes and monkeys? If a few criminals were locked up for citizens to visit, it would also be a very beneficial method.</p>
<p>I accidentally picked up a withered "Lily of the Valley" at the door, and I felt that life is too cruel and ruthless. A flower is like a young girl. I carefully wiped the abandoned "Lily of the Valley" with a silk scarf, put it in a small and exquisite brocade box, and wrote two hundred passionate words on the back of the brocade box to express my little bit of feeling.</p>

<h3>A Strange Tale of Kisses</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>A long time ago, I published an article called "An Anthology of Kisses" in Chunqiu. Recently, I found many more "Strange Tales of Kisses" in Western newspapers. Because they were very interesting, I gathered them together and wrote them below.</p>
<p>Kissing Fine A traveler who arrived in Moscow, Soviet Union, immediately encountered a surprising incident. Because he kissed his wife on the train, he was fined five pounds. He said that because she didn't feel very well, he intended to give her a few kisses to cheer her up. Unexpectedly, as soon as he finished kissing her, the military police on the train came to ask him for a fine. According to Soviet law, kissing on trains, in cars, or in public places is illegal and punishable? Whether the kissing couple is married or not, the punishment is the same. Moscow recently passed a law requiring all taxis to operate in well-lit areas.</p>
<p>Kissing Photography On the silver screen, we often see male and female stars embracing and kissing when they are expressing intense emotions. However, since the invention of sound films, which replaced silent films, kiss shots must now include the sound of the kiss, so they cannot be faked. Mae West is a very popular star in Hollywood. When she was filming a new movie, she had to shoot a kissing scene, and the first kiss had to have the sound of lips trembling. Everything was ready, and the director gave the command, "Miss Mae, kiss lightly." Mae then kissed the male lead. Who knew that the sound was too light. They tried again, but it was too heavy. They did countless kisses without getting the shot right. This really made Mae West furious. Finally, the director came up with the clever idea of ​​attaching a piece of silk to the microphone, and the kissing scene was finally filmed.</p>
<p>Kissing Love Letter A Mrs. Rice Brooke from Sydney wrote a letter to her lover in Estonia, along with a package. Because the letter contained the sentence "A thousand kisses to you," her husband sued for divorce. As for the package, it contained sausages. Her lover was called Kirk, and her letter read: "My dear Martin Kirk, I returned home safely. Shea was already awake. I know he must know that I was out all night. I am all yours, and all my thoughts revolve around you. A thousand kisses to you, my dear child. Now I'm sending you some sausages. Shea is watching me closely, and suddenly asked why I don't have a child. If these sausages aren't very good now, then just cook them for five minutes, and they will taste better." Kirk's reply: "I hope to see you in my dreams, your big child." Because of these two letters, the most important thing was "...a thousand kisses to you..." and the court ruled for divorce.</p>
<p>Kissing Enemies Since the beginning of history, love has occupied a large part of human life. Women live for love, men die for love, children are the crystallization of love, and most of the poems and novels written by poets and scholars focus on love. Even illiterate people will naturally sing folk love songs. After love matures between men and women, regardless of civilization or barbarism, there is a common formula, which is to express it with a kiss. Whether they are foolish men or foolish women, when they reach the peak of love, they will unconsciously embrace and kiss passionately. But there are exceptions. In North Africa, there are some ethnic groups where women do not know how to kiss. They will never kiss anyone until they die of old age. If a man wants to kiss them, they will treat him as an enemy, without a doubt. In this world, they may be the enemies of kissing.</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Floating Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But this fox's vanity is very heavy - vanity is not considered a bad habit. It felt that if it cut off its ninth tail, its inherent beauty would be completely lost, and how could it have the face to live on after that? Therefore, it was unwilling to suffer the punishment of tail cutting anymore. So it sincerely pleaded with the Jade Emperor, "From now on, I am thoroughly awakened - whatever you want me to do, I am willing to do my best, but please allow me to keep this last tail. Let me keep a little bit of dignity, and I will be eternally grateful to you. Please allow me to repent! From now until the day the world is destroyed, I will never dare to do any bad things again!" After such a tearful plea, the compassionate Jade Emperor couldn't help but feel compassion again - he lowered his head and thought for a long time, and finally came up with a solution. He said to the fox, "Your past sins are really too many, and logically you should not be pardoned. Now that you have shown sincere remorse, I will forgive you once more. This time, however, you cannot be as carefree as before! I will now assign you a job, teach you to carefully take on the responsibility of treating all kinds of human diseases, and appoint you as the God of Healing. The term of this job is nine thousand years. Because it is not such a long time, it cannot offset your previous sins!" The fox listened and readily agreed without any difficulty, so it retained its last tail. This tail represents the bad habit of infatuated admiration for beautiful women. This bad habit is already the worst of its original nine, and at the same time, it got the title of "Great Green Fox Immortal". (206)</p>

<h3>Homemade Lead-Acid Batteries</h3>
<p>— Yongchang</p>
<p>It seems that no one has talked about the homemade production of storage batteries. Now I will introduce what I have learned through experience. The price of a storage battery is two or three yuan for a Class A battery and more than ten yuan for a Class B battery. If you can make it yourself, the total cost will be less than three yuan.</p>
<p>(1) Materials</p>
<p>Pure lead: Purchase from lead and tin shops or auto repair shops.</p>
<p>Sulfuric acid: Purchase from pharmacies, about four corners per pound. Lead dioxide: Also available from pharmacies, or use nitric acid and peach dan (purchase from Chinese pharmacies) and heat together to obtain a brown powder.</p>
<p>Pure lead powder: This powder is not easy to buy and can be replaced with mitoseng from Chinese pharmacies.</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturing</p>
<p>First, use a very thin piece of wood as a bottom template, and then make two clay molds. After the molds have hardened, carve many parallel grooves on the molds, with a gap of about half an inch between the grooves (as shown in the figure). Then put the two molds together and pour in molten lead. The finished lead plates will have protruding grid patterns on both sides. Make several of these lead cups.</p>
<p>Half of the lead plates are used as the positive electrode, and the grids are filled with a mixture of lead dioxide and sulfuric acid. Half are used as the negative electrode, and the grids are filled with pure lead powder, or a mixture of mitoseng and sulfuric acid. These two sets of lead plates are inserted into a glass container with intervals. Each cathode and anode must be separated by insulation. Finally, a mixture of one part sulfuric acid and ten parts distilled water (note: the sulfuric acid must be slowly poured into the distilled water; do not pour the distilled water into the sulfuric acid, otherwise there is a risk of explosion) is added to the glass bottle. Connect the cathode and anode plates in series to form the cathode and anode poles, and then seal the top with rosin to form a perfect storage battery.</p>
<p>The voltage of this storage battery is 108 volts when fully charged, and the current depends on the area of the plates. Approximately one ampere of current is generated for every twelve square inches of the area of the cathode and anode. Although the homemade storage battery is not as effective as the commercially available product, it is much cheaper. Readers, why not give it a try?</p>
<h3>Latest Small Acorn Vacuum Tube</h3>
<p>— Yisun</p>
<p>Recently, the American RCA company has announced the successful manufacture of small vacuum tubes, and these vacuum tubes are already on sale in the market. It is named RCA955A acorn tube, and the price is also quite cheap. The purpose of manufacturing this vacuum tube is to minimize the capacitance between the internal electrodes, especially for ultra-short wave reception, which will not cause various problems. It is also very effective for receiving broadcasts or other wavelengths.</p>
<p>Speaking of the size of this vacuum tube, it is only the size of an acorn, with a height of one and sixteen-sixteenths of an inch, and a width of only one inch (including the wiring terminals). The various properties of this vacuum tube are similar to those of the ordinary No. 37. It is also a triode, but with an indirectly heated cathode. The filament uses 6.3 volts for lighting and 0.16 amps. The capacitance between the screen and the grid is 1.4 mmfd, the capacitance between the grid and the cathode is mmre, and the capacitance between the screen and the cathode is 6mmjd, which can be said to be extremely small.</p>
<h3>Substitute for Audio Frequency Choke</h3>
<p>— Yongyan</p>
<p>In the filtering circuit of the B battery, the audio frequency choke coil is an indispensable component. However, the cost of an accurately designed, sturdy, and durable audio frequency choke coil is very high. For the sake of economy, we may as well use a substitute, which is the resistor we commonly use.</p>
<p>Using a resistor to replace the audio frequency choke coil seems to be slightly inferior in terms of blocking ability; but it also has considerable advantages. One: the cost is low; two: it occupies a very small area; three: the matching effect caused by the iron core of the audio frequency choke coil can be avoided after replacing it with a resistor.</p>
<p>The number of ohms of this resistor must be determined according to the vacuum tube in the machine, as long as it does not excessively reduce the B voltage. In ordinary two- or three-tube machines using 27 or 37 and other vacuum tubes, about 3,000 or 4,000 ohms are used. If the number of vacuum tubes is increased, the number of ohms can be reduced. If the machine has powerful audio frequency amplification, the number of ohms should be further reduced. The detailed number can be determined by testing. The number of watts of this resistor, ordinary one-watt, is not too hot, and three watts can also be used in a powerful audio frequency amplifier, and it is of course better to use a larger one.</p>
<h3>Single-Tube Crystal Dual-Use Machine</h3>
<p>— Cai Rixin</p>
<p>The A-141 tube is produced by Philips. Its structure is double-grid, dual-gate, with extremely high amplification, and very low cathode voltage. The B voltage used is only a dozen volts enough; so this vacuum tube is valued by amateurs. This article introduces a single-tube machine with excellent selectivity and superb volume. We know that the reason why crystal radio is eliminated is because it has the advantage of not using electricity. Adding a crystal to the circuit of this single-tube machine makes it a dual-use machine. The circuit diagram is as follows:</p>
<p>L1: 24-gauge wire, in the L1 coil.</p>
<p>L1: 26-gauge wire, wound 56 turns on the same.</p>
<p>L2: Wound 34 turns on the same. (The above are installed on a three-circuit frame)</p>
<p>C: .0005 microfarad variable capacitor.</p>
<p>Cc: .00025 microfarad fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>V: Philips A-141 tube.</p>
<p>D: Sensitive ore.</p>
<p>R: 20-ohm variable resistor.</p>
<p>R1: 2 megohm grid leak.</p>
<p>A: One and a half volts.</p>
<p>B: Twenty-two and a half or sixteen and a half volts.</p>
<h3>Low-Frequency Amplification Coupling Circuit</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>(B) Resistance Coupling</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 3, this type of coupling method has been widely used since the prevalence of AC machines, because its advantages cannot be matched by transformer coupling. First, this type has no frequency characteristics, so the amplification performance for any frequency is extremely smooth and consistent; second, because there is no parallel resonance phenomenon, each frequency of speech and music can obtain equal amplification, so there is no distortion. In addition, because a tetrode is used for detection, its AC screen resistance is extremely high, and it cannot be successful without a larger value of resistance coupling. Therefore, resistance coupling is the best. Although the amplification rate of this type is limited to the vacuum tube itself when applied, and a high-value B voltage must be prepared, the emergence of pentode high-power output tubes and the circulation of AC power have also solved the problem.</p>
<h3>Figure 3</h3>
<p>It is commonly believed that in order to obtain greater output power, a push-pull connection using transformer coupling is necessary. However, this is not the case. Resistance coupling can also be used for push-pull amplification. Only one reverse-phase vacuum tube needs to be added, as shown in Figure 4·A. However, the voltage before and after this tube must be the same, otherwise distortion will occur.</p>
<h3>Figure 4</h3>
<p>(C) Mixed Resistance Coupling</p>
<p>This type of coupling method is quite similar to the aforementioned resistance coupling, as shown in Figure 5. The difference is that the change in the screen current of the front tube is transmitted to the voltage change of the grid of the rear tube, which does not pass through a resistor, but through the total impedance of inductance and capacitance in parallel. This type of coupling method is because its inductance impedance is larger than the differential resistance of the screen circuit, so the voltage amplification ratio will be equal to the amplification coefficient of the vacuum tube.</p>
<h3>Figure 5</h3>
<p>In order to obtain a higher voltage amplification ratio, mixed resistance coupling resistance coupling is better, because the first is because of the great [rest of the text is missing and garbled]</p>
<p>At the same time, the resistance is very small, so there is no need to apply a high voltage to the screen; second, the voltage input to the grid of the secondary tube is equal to the product of the screen current and the coupling resistance or impedance, and this type of coupling method, the total impedance after adding impedance to the screen circuit, is smaller than the total impedance of adding the same amount of resistance, so the screen current is larger, then the potential drop across the coupling impedance, that is, the voltage input to the rear tube is naturally higher, therefore this method is better than resistance coupling.</p>
<p>Figure 6 shows another type of mixed resistance coupling, called parallel screen voltage type, which is commonly used to avoid the magnetic field saturation of transformer coupling, and its effect is very good. Since it is mixed resistance coupling, it also does not lose the advantages of transformer coupling, commonly using resistors to replace low-frequency choke coils, which varies according to the design.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a direct coupling type, but because it is less commonly used and more complicated, it will not be repeated.</p>
<h3>Figure 6</h3>
<h3>Import of Wireless Materials This Year</h3>
<p>Because my country's industry and commerce are immature, most of the wireless materials still rely on imports. The import volume this year has increased significantly compared with last year. According to foreign reports, the following is the situation.</p>
<p>In the first ten months of this year, the total value of wireless machines and parts imported into China was 1,348,400 yuan for American goods, 197,022 yuan for Japanese goods, 142,340 yuan for German goods, 108,856 yuan for British goods, 64,941 yuan for Dutch goods, and 36,397 yuan for other countries, totaling 1,898,158 yuan. Excluding 8,082 yuan returned to foreign countries, the total import volume was 1,890,076 yuan, which is equivalent to 3,723,669 yuan in national currency, an increase of more than 800,000 yuan compared with 2,936,035 yuan in the same period last year.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that if my country wants to promote the wireless industry, it still needs to work hard to manufacture its own components so as to reduce leakage.</p>
<p>Small Experience</p>
<h3>Vacuum Tubes and Sound Quality</h3>
<p>— Gu Yaoming</p>
<p>I made a four-tube AC machine myself, with 24 high-frequency amplification, 56 detection, 47 amplification, and 80 rectification. The speaker uses a dynamic type, and the parts are all suitable. After it was made, the sound quality was extremely poor, and the radio reception was blurry; using a pickup to play music, the sound quality was very good. This must be a high-frequency amplification problem. The inspection result was that the 24 tube had been shelved for too long, and I didn't test it when I bought it. There seemed to be an unnecessary gas leaking between the filament plate and the barrier electrode, turning into a blue light, resulting in blurry and poor sound quality. I once tested it, as shown in the figure, with B+ connected to the barrier electrode. Later I realized that vacuum tubes also have a close relationship with sound quality.</p>
<h3>Simple Measurement Method for the Ratio of Audio Frequency Transformers</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>There is a simple measurement method for the ratio of audio frequency transformers. The instruments used are nothing more than an AC voltmeter that can measure up to 45 volts, and an electric bell square shed (or replace it with a low-voltage coil of a power transformer). When measuring, first connect the primary of the electric bell square shed to the power line, and the secondary to the primary of the audio frequency transformer. Then use an AC voltmeter to measure the voltage of the secondary of the audio frequency transformer, and divide this number by the voltage of the secondary coil of the electric bell square shed to get the ratio of the audio frequency transformer. For example, if the voltage of the secondary coil of an audio frequency transformer is measured to be 15 volts according to the above method, and the secondary of the electric bell transformer used is 6 volts, dividing 15 by 6 yields a quotient of 2.5, so we know that the ratio of this audio frequency transformer is 2.5.</p>

<h3>Dostoevsky, Shaw, and Pirandello</h3>
<p>— Tianren</p>
<p>In Pirandello's eyes, the world is just a "lie". Everyone wears a mask, relying on "instinctive conscience" to live by telling "lies". Rational life laughs, but instinctive "life" secretly sheds tears. The author is troubled by real life. This is the case in "Six Characters in Search of an Author."</p>
<p>Starting from here, after he wrote "Come Prima, Meglio di Prima" (As Before, Better Than Before), his philosophy leaped even further, turning the "reality" and fiction in "Six Characters in Search of an Author" into fantasy.</p>
<p>Finally, even fantasy was not enough, so he brought out mad characters. The protagonist in "Henry IV" (Enrico IV) is such a character.</p>
<p>Real life annoyed the author. It goes without saying that the annoyance was caused by the doubt arising from the real society. What happens next? Satire, what else can be done? Other than satire, if you want to satirize, you have to make the half-crazy characters express themselves uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Pirandello's worldview is like this. First, compare him with Dostoevsky. They have something in common at the starting point of their creation.</p>
<p>Pirandello said that life is dualistic. There is "right" and "wrong" in life. Only the misery and unhappiness of human instincts can occur in a rational society. He looked at these with anger.</p>
<p>There is also an element of social injustice in Dostoevsky's realism. We can understand this by reading "Crime and Punishment". There is a "prophetic" element in Dostoevsky's works, but Pirandello always expresses "doubt" about life.</p>
<p>In "Henry IV", the protagonist is a Quixote. Everything in society is unpleasant to him, so he goes back to the eleventh century, puts on the costumes of ancient emperors, and lives like a lunatic. If he didn't doubt real life, would he need to go crazy? But in the end, he has to eat human food. One day, he fell off his horse, like a big dream, and dragged him back from a life of contradictions. He saw that his beloved lover had become someone else's wife. This made him angry again, and he went back to his madness, resulting in a bloody tragedy. This is another Quixote. He can't think of a way to solve reality, only doubt.</p>
<p>He said this in the short story Laprapcole:</p>
<p>"Some form of life is death. We only know that we are some trapped people. You can't always make him abandon us and head towards the road of death. Our existence has already been destined."</p>
<p>This is the sorrow of disillusionment caused by doubt. Can you say that he is the same as Dostoevsky?</p>
<p>There is also an element of humor, which is also very important in modern Italian literature. For example, Nanzini and Campanile, who were contemporaries of Pirandello, were called masters of humor, because they doubted the real society, so they wanted to appeal for injustice, stubbornly kick down reason, and find a way out for instinct. The protagonist often emits unhealthy satirical laughter from the tragedy, so humor is the best and only way.</p>
<p>Pirandello's humor is somewhat similar to Shaw's in his old age, but if you look closely, he is different from Shaw, but opposite to him.</p>
<p>Both of them are dissatisfied with the old society, and both deny the old social system with a satirical tone. Shaw's humor seems to have a critical meaning, while Pirandello's humor is just a mockery in the air. This is ultimately a "drawing a tiger" criticism. Humor that doesn't scratch the itch is even more mediocre and boring. What's the use of empty satire?</p>
<p>Some say that Shaw is "relying on his old age to sell his wisdom", but Pirandello is not much younger than him.</p>
<h3>At Haiphong</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>After enduring half the night cramped in the cold train, Haiphong was finally in sight far away.</p>
<p>Towering buildings, sparkling bright lights, under the dark sky, the brilliance of thousands of electric lights reflected so red.</p>
<p>Far away, there was a vast expanse of white sea. The fields and temples shrouded in the night glowed with sparse lights. This late-night Haiphong was unexpectedly so beautiful and lovely, making the hearts of young people growing up in the countryside come alive.</p>
<p>In the paddy fields full of sparkling water, there were a few dim yellow electric lights bathing. I heard that this was used for fishing. This thing is really new.</p>
<p>After the car arrived in Haiphong, in the chaotic noise, I jumped into the car and was hurriedly pulled by a rickshaw driver to the shop, as if escaping.</p>
<p>Most of the shops here are opened by Cantonese people. Many overseas Chinese make a living here, but it's a pity that I don't understand Cantonese and can't talk to them about their living conditions. Only heaven knows.</p>
<p>The municipality of Haiphong is under the administration of French imperialism, and it is not bad: neat and clean asphalt roads are lined with rows of lush green trees. Walking slowly on this street under the hot sun during the day, people will not feel any heat.</p>
<p>Haiphong is the same as other cities: there is a park for people to visit. On the second day after arriving in Haiphong, having nothing to do, three young people made an appointment to go there for a walk.</p>
<p>Although the place is small, it is very quiet - tigers, leopards, etc. are all available. Several tropical plants, towering high, shaded the sky. Next to the flowerbeds with red and green reflections is a path paved with fine sand. With a curious heart, walking slowly on this road and admiring it, is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Because I had to wait for the ship, I couldn't help but delay the days. Every day when I got up, looking at the clear blue sky, the slowly floating white clouds, and the dark green distant trees, the heart of homesickness was drawn up by the scenery of this foreign country.</p>
<p>One morning, with tears in my eyes, I wrote a short letter to my father far away. I told him that I had quietly left him and ran to this foreign country. Please forgive me: I cannot help him with the hoe at home. I am a pursuer of light, and I want to go to the distant side of the sea!</p>
<h3>Coarse Cloth</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Returning from the Volcano (2)</h3>
<p>— Lanru</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I endured the suffering until one o'clock. Because the wind and waves were too strong, the ship was like a flying machine suspended in the sky, sometimes rising from the seabed to the sky, and sometimes plummeting from the sky to the seabed. Neither Yang nor I could sleep, and our heads throbbed as if being hammered with iron. We both vomited violently, and I regretted coming. The suffering from Shanghai to Kobe had been enough, so why did I have to endure this pain again? I watched as the Japanese passengers slept soundly, snoring, while I stood alone on the stern, vomiting into the vast sea. At that moment, I further confirmed my view of life. Yes, life is painful, and also contradictory. We know full well that only through many difficulties and much suffering can we gain a moment of joy, yet we are willing to strive to pursue it desperately. I don't know if this is life's contradiction or life's true meaning? Is it the cleverness of human intelligence or its foolishness?</p>
<p>"We're here! We're here!"</p>
<p>In the vast darkness, we suddenly spotted electric lights flickering like stars. This was Ōshima Island. We felt joyful and excited, as if saved from death. The passengers all stood by the ship's railing, but as the wind and waves grew stronger, they squeezed back inside. However, I, greedy for the sight of the marine scenery heralding the dawn, forgot about the assault of the morning breeze, and my hands were already frozen.</p>
<p>Originally, the ship should have docked at Motomura, but because of the strong wind and waves, it couldn't. We had to change course and dock at Okada Port. The innkeepers, each carrying a lantern, lined up on the shore, calling out words of welcome to the guests. But no one wanted to go to the inn to rest, and everyone hurried onto the mountain ridge, bathed in the fish-belly-colored dawn.</p>
<p>From the foot of the mountain to the mountainside, you could take a car, and it only cost thirty cents. However, Mr. Qin suggested that walking would allow us to enjoy the scenery, and everyone agreed. At that time, three Japanese students from Tokyo Imperial University joined our group. One of them was acquainted with Mr. Qin, and this was his second time visiting the volcano, so he was a good guide for us. Like a group of soldiers on an expedition, we ran forward with vigor, eager to reach the summit as soon as possible and see the volcano, which we had never seen before, and to pay our respects to the nameless heroes who had committed suicide for love.</p>
<p>We took a different mountain path from the cars. Although there were no red leaves, the lush forests were as beautiful as spring. Bright red camellias bloomed everywhere, and the spring breeze gently blew on the faces of the visitors, creating an indescribable sense of comfort and warmth.</p>
<p>After walking more than six miles, our legs were a little sore, and our hunger was unbearable. So we sat down on the ground and ate the bread, fruit, and biscuits that each of us had brought. The three Imperial University students were more experienced than us after all, and had bought many cans of food and pork. We all put aside our own food and ate the meat they brought. Mr. Qin (a Japanese, our Japanese teacher) said with a smile, "Are you all carnivores?" In fact, he didn't understand that the Chinese are different from the Japanese. Even wealthy Japanese rarely eat meat, while the Chinese treat meat as a side dish.</p>
<h3>Who Can Satisfy Their Material Needs?</h3>
<p>— Bo Han</p>
<p>"If we want to eliminate that kind of spiritual superstition, we can only do so by satisfying their material needs. Whoever can satisfy the peasants' demands for harvest will be the one who can eliminate the superstition of 'harvest' among the peasants. Whoever can satisfy the material needs of the townspeople for a secure and happy life will be the one who can fundamentally eliminate superstition in the city." This is Mr. Wu Jian's conclusion in the "Free Talk" of December 3rd, discussing superstition.</p>
<p>Naturally, superstition cannot be eliminated by popular science lectures, nor by so-called superficial actions such as destroying temples, which are carried out from a position of social science. "Regarding superstition, the most important thing is to see its material origins." No one can make the farmers harvest more grain, so the farmers respect the Land God; no one can make the townspeople live in peace and happiness, so the city residents believe in the City God Bodhisattva. In other words, the so-called material origin is that the failure to satisfy material needs becomes the ultimate cause of superstition.</p>
<p>If human society one day realizes "human determination conquers nature" and material needs can be universally and rationally satisfied, then there should be no superstition at all. But now it is impossible to talk about the realization of "human determination conquers nature" in the whole society. If the material needs of some people are satisfied, superstition can be eliminated, then capitalists should not believe in God, and defeated warlords should not burn incense and chant Buddha.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is precisely the satisfaction of material needs that consolidates the psychology of superstition. For example, if a poor person wins money in a lottery or wins the top prize in an aviation lottery, he will attribute it to the help of his deceased ancestors in the netherworld, or to the manifestation of a certain god he has prayed to in the past. In the present, when mankind does not universally enjoy happiness, the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of the material needs of some people can often become the cause of superstition: because the point is not whether they are satisfied or not, but that the reasons for making people satisfied or dissatisfied are a blind, uncontrollable supernatural power for them.</p>
<p>However, in fact, for most people, who can satisfy their material needs? It is impossible for ordinary people of flesh and blood to shoulder this responsibility with individual strength. This can only rely on the power of society, that is, the power of the group, and must include themselves. If they do not grasp this point, but only pray to any savior other than themselves, whether it is a heavenly or earthly saint, if this mentality is not changed for a day, that is, if there is no self-confidence in their minds for a day, how can the root of superstition be eliminated?</p>
<p>Therefore, after talking about "starting from the contradictions of superstition itself," it seems that the contradiction between "who" and "them" in that conclusion should also be resolved.</p>
<h3>Cocoon (2)</h3>
<p>— (Original by Lin Fang) Translated by Jingzi</p>
<p>That's how it was.</p>
<p>This was one of the bad tempers of middle school students at that time. Senior students often bullied junior students. Using any unreasonable reason, they often liked to wave their barbaric fists at the pitiful victims in the deserted grassland. One day, when the two of us were taking a walk in the back mountain as usual, we were unexpectedly caught by that group of bad students.</p>
<p>One of them – always the son of the old boss of the local silk factory, that barbarian king who repeated grades, named Dahe – slowly approached.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's Sakai! You look really smug lately!"</p>
<p>Sakai stared at the other person's face for a while, and then resolutely said:</p>
<p>"How am I smug!"</p>
<p>The other party suddenly reached out and punched him in the chest.</p>
<p>"You junior, what are you being stubborn about! That's what I call smug!"</p>
<p>He fell to the ground, but soon got up again and punched the other party in the chest. However, his body was too small, and there were three people on the other side, so he was finally knocked down to the ground again, and beaten wildly like a puppy. The second time he got up, this time he was holding a shiny new pencil sharpener in his right hand.</p>
<p>The color immediately disappeared from the other party's lips, and Sakai's cheeks suddenly turned pale. He chased after Dahe, who was scurrying like a rat.</p>
<p>The other party fled to the hill, which was the hill where Sakai had stepped on the snake's head before. The road had come to an end, and the other party, in the state of a cornered rat, turned back and stood there.</p>
<p>"If you have the guts to kill, then kill me and see!"</p>
<p>The other party, putting on a show of strength, took off his coat and threw it on the ground, stretching out his two trembling arms.</p>
<p>"I will kill you!"</p>
<p>Sakai's voice was listless. The cold light of the knife began to cut through the air.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>Watching from afar, all the blood in my body froze, and I involuntarily shouted out like this. And Dahe also fell to the ground at this time.</p>
<p>The group of companions hurried to lift Dahe's waist and ran forward. Sakai stared blankly, watching until the group disappeared into the woods. He inexplicably fell to the ground and didn't move.</p>
<p>My terrified soul recovered, and I hurried forward. His face was buried in the summer grass, and his eyebrows were twitching.</p>
<p>Why? I really don't understand why.</p>

<h3>Magazine Year and the Ancient Book Craze</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>If this year is said to be the year of magazines, then within this year of magazines, there is a rather special phenomenon, which is the craze for reprinting ancient books. First, the experienced Commercial Press took the lead by reprinting the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries on a large scale. For a time, various bookstores rose up like a storm, competing to follow suit. Following this were the Zhonghua Book Company's Illustrated Compendium of Books, the Kaiming Bookstore's Twenty-Five Histories, and the Book and Newspaper Cooperative's Twenty-Six Histories, and the Commercial Press's Ten Comprehensive Records. These were all amazing projects. Those compiled and printed by private individuals also included the recently reported Collection of Ci Poetry and Prose. Ancient books, which had been suppressed for many years, can be said to be having a great run of luck lately. However, when we look back at the garden of new culture, even single-volume creations are withering away badly. Publishers are vying to take the path of magazines. Although there are many magazines, when compared with the reprinted ancient books, the human and financial resources spent are much smaller and more pitiful. This is a distorted development, and this distorted development has deep-rooted social relations.</p>
<p>In short, we are not opposed to receiving past heritage and sorting out past heritage. However, the question is how to do the work of receiving and sorting out, and what are the motives and ultimate goals of this work? The evolution of human society, in addition to the biological inheritance of individuals, also has cultural inheritance, because culture progresses by accumulation. Therefore, modern culture can hardly be isolated from past culture. However, the so-called receiving heritage means searching and sorting out things that are beneficial to the development of modern culture from the past heritage with a critical eye, because its starting point and ultimate goal are in the creation of new culture, so it is very different from the general reversal of history and blind adherence to ancient ways. Although the methods of the Ten Comprehensive Records, Twenty-Five Histories, etc. are old, they can help us understand the past society. The Collection of Ci Poetry and Prose may also provide us with materials for studying ancient literary criticism. In a sense, this is very gratifying. However, whether publishers are consciously doing this now is still a question. Otherwise, why spend heavily to reprint dozens or even hundreds of "masterpieces," but not be willing to take a fraction of this capital to print some small pamphlets and single volumes that are not easy to profit from but are very beneficial to the general readers? Ancient books do not have their own independent value. Ancient books only have their value in promoting the growth of new books. In other words, reprinting ancient books is only a means of promoting culture, not an end. It is only valuable to reprint ancient books for the sake of new books.</p>
<p>However, when we look at the new books in recent years, single volumes have been very few, and only magazines are supporting the scene. Are there no new works worth printing as single volumes? Just saving two glass plates for reprinting ancient books, and reducing some icing on the cake in terms of decoration, wouldn't the money saved be enough to print two new works that are very readable? Publishers should not produce purely for the purpose of "making profit."</p>
<p>The problem falls on the readers. You are not willing to reverse the trend of history and pursue the dream of restoring the past, and your desire for knowledge is extremely strong. In this environment, what should you do? The pyramids of Memphis appear as rose-colored pillars in the morning light, but show black triangular shadows in the afterglow. A thing often has two sides, advantages and disadvantages. As long as you are willing to work hard, you will not find it difficult to sift out the glittering gold grains of new knowledge from the sand of ancient books!</p>
<h3>Words of the Bookworm</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Whenever the sun sets and I walk to that newly opened French bookstore on Nanjing Road with a slightly casual mood, I am often attracted by the colorful and beautiful covers in the glass window. I smoke and put my hands in the pockets of my coat, unwilling to leave. The urban street scene of busy traffic behind me has long been forgotten, and my fantasy is wandering in the poetic realm of Verlaine and Baudelaire. I don't have any money, so I just stare at those small books in a daze. Even when I leave, my steps are doubly slow, and I look back with a little reluctance and melancholy at the neon lights that have just been lit.</p>
<p>I am passionate about reading books, ancient, modern, Chinese, Western, thirty-two-mo sized, sixteen-mo sized, thread-bound, leather-bound, I am willing to collect them all. As long as I open a newly bought book and smell the scent of the paper, I yearn to browse through it with a feeling of excitement and gratitude. As long as I go to a bookstore and see the books taking various poses and wearing various clothes, leaning on the bookshelves, I really want to transplant each one to my small study. In the morning or at dusk, I want to madly drink the wisdom of the times by the dim light of the sun and the glow of the bright lamp.</p>
<p>However, this wish is very difficult to achieve after all. It is just as the Greek myth says, a person is punished by the gods, forever able to see the鲜艳 of the apple and smell the芬香 of the apple, but unable to quickly enjoy it. This is an unbearable punishment. When I don't have money, I sometimes go to old bookstores to play around. There are many bookstores on North Sichuan Road and the City God Temple. Every one opens its doors for you to enter. Just searching and discovering in this is an indescribable pleasure, like walking into the Shanyin Road, with no time to take it all in. On this side is a verdant and lush cliff, and on that side are several clusters of beautiful mountain flowers, and even streams and thatched huts. As long as you are patient, you will not find it difficult to discover them one by one. Even if you don't return满载而归, isn't that翻阅 also give you奇趣 that movie theaters and dance halls cannot provide?</p>
<p>France said: "Books are the opium of the West, they will destroy us." This of course means that reading becomes so engrossed in and uncontrolled that one sinks into a chronic suicide, but the choice and discernment are also up to ourselves, and opium can sometimes be used as a medicinal material. An author uses his wisdom to write a book, and this book is displayed on the bookshelves of many people. His name is constantly being mentioned, and his ideas affect the ideas of countless people. He is no longer himself, he has merged with the souls of many readers. And a reader can make some good friends from the black words on white paper and peek at the familiar faces of each of them.</p>
<p>As for me, I like to read books that are rich in nourishment, which makes my skeleton healthy and my muscles plump, so I often spend my spare time on this. A cup of tea, a Peace cigarette, whether you lean on it to watch or sit to read, this aftertaste is sweet enough.</p>
<p>If the bookworm erodes books, or erodes books because it loves books, then I am willing to be a bookworm, but not a bookworm that desperately, indomitably, and painstakingly studies, but a bookworm that can wander in the縹緗, eat the book, and digest the book!</p>
<h3>Winter Storage</h3>
<p>— Forget Myself</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>In winter, the sky is filled with heavy fog. Dragging my tired body and the suitcase that has suffered the wind and frost for a year, I go to the train station.</p>
<p>There are unexpectedly many passengers at the station, carrying big bags and small suitcases, probably all stealing a few days of vacation to return to their homes. I squeezed out of the crowd onto the platform, and after occupying a seat in the carriage, the train slowly left the station.</p>
<p>Naturally, the carriage is equally crowded with people, all of whom have tired bodies, but I also know that the joy in their hearts is the same as mine. The joy of wanderers being able to return to their hometowns at the so-called end of the year can be imagined. Thinking that a week ago, I received a letter written by my child, who was learning to write, I turned the calendar to calculate the date of returning home, and even became lazy at work. Originally, having been away from home for six or seven years, I just wrote a family letter at the end of each year. Now that the child in his mother's arms can pick up a pen and write a letter asking his father to come home, thinking about those long and distant days, how can it not excite people?</p>
<p>Last night, I received double my salary from the account room's window. When I walked out of the factory gate, I felt like a big rich man. Walking through the bustling street, I was sometimes mesmerized by the neon lights in the glass cabinets. I should cut a nice piece of clothing material for my wife and buy a beautiful hat for my six or seven year old child. But paying attention to the prices marked on them, I felt that my double salary seemed too small. So I went from this bustling street to that one, and picked out objects that suited me in many, many glass cabinets. When I returned to my residence, I carefully put them into my suitcase, anticipating the unexpected joy that these gifts would receive.</p>
<p>When I get to the door of my house, my child must be waiting at the door, but I don't recognize him, and he doesn't recognize me. So I will go up and ask him my name. I can clearly hear from his small mouth; "That's my dad." I will pick him up, kiss his apple-like face, and at the same time, my wife will hear my voice, put down the work in her hands, and run to the door to greet me.</p>
<p>When I get inside, perhaps my wife has specially prepared a snack for me. I will order the mother and son to close their eyes, and take out the gifts from the suitcase. The child is afraid of peeking at my movements, and when he sees the beautiful hat, he jumps up and snatches it away. When my wife sees the clothing material, she will also hold it up to the mirror and pose, just like when she was a new bride. How long has she not worn such expensive clothing material!</p>
<p>Thinking, thinking, just as I closed my eyes, I heard the rooster crow. And the alarm clock on the head of the bed, because I forgot to tighten the spring last night, the hour and minute hands stopped at twelve o'clock. At times like this, I hope that the death-urging whistle of the汔笛 will pull a long ring to estimate the time. But today this world is still, the factory gates are tightly closed, no smoke is rising from the chimney, and the companions who get up at that time every day are probably all in sweet dreams. Even the sparrows that chirp on the eaves are driven away by the heavy fog. If I can represent this world, it is my excited heart.</p>
<p>After the car started moving, it slowly calmed down. Naturally, in a short time, I can embrace my嬌妻 and撫愛子 and enjoy a family reunion.</p>
<p>When I take the bread out of my suitcase to fill my stomach, I also play with those two lovely gifts. In this way, the car will take me to my hometown.</p>
<p>Stepping on the land of my hometown, the scenery in front of me is all亲切. Having been separated from my hometown for six or seven years, I can still live to return. I am so happy that I am crying. But won't these few days of happy reunion pass in an instant? We are the pitiable people oppressed by life, as if we should not have a hometown or a family. Haven't we been tortured by life for six or seven years? Thinking like this, I can't help but slow down my steps. I'm afraid to see my door, and I don't know how my idealized嬌妻愛子 have been honed to. We are all human beings, why is there such inequality? The excited heart just now is now oppressed like today's heavy fog! However, the door of my house is finally getting closer and closer and is right in front of me...</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Xue Hong</p>
<p>Dusk routinely crept into this spacious old mansion.</p>
<p>The electric lights were hung sparsely, as if they were quietly peeking at something. All sorts of different postures were being displayed here, but in short, the atmosphere in this old mansion did not lose its peaceful order due to the activities of many individuals.</p>
<p>The teachers were not hiding in their bedrooms smoking cigarettes because they were correcting homework, but were sitting on the edge of the bed in groups of three or four, talking about something that others could not join in. There were no people going to the street to visit friends or stroll around tonight, probably because no one initiated it.</p>
<p>The teachers' affairs, the students don't need to know, and the students' affairs, the teachers don't need to know, this seems to be what every student is asking for in their hearts. In fact,</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>there is no need to ask, but what is desired has already been realized. Because various possible techniques are sufficient to make it impossible for teachers to know all the things that students like to do that should be prohibited. However, perhaps some teachers clearly know something about the students but pretend to be deaf and dumb.</p>
<p>In this way, under the light intensity that connects brightness and darkness, in the corners of the wall suitable for private conversations, some people dare to whisper secrets.</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of people saying bad things about me. Aren't young people worthy of being in love?"</p>
<p>With pursed lips and glancing eyes, it was clearly the tone of a reckless child.</p>
<p>"Who says young people aren't worthy of being in love!"</p>
<p>He placed his two palms on the head of his young companion, making a proud and joyful pose. The person looked only seventeen or eighteen years old.</p>
<p>"Let me see her letter!" The companion demanded from him.</p>
<p>A pink letter was slowly and carefully pulled out from the child's uniform pants pocket.</p>
<p>The companion took it and read aloud the salutation at the beginning of the letter.</p>
<p>"How can you read it out loud!" The child snatched it back and stuffed it into his pocket, saying seriously, "She really loves me!"</p>
<p>He said that she was like a devil, not knowing how to suppress the burning passion that was about to rush out of her heart. He also said how infatuatedly he stared at her in the classroom, making all the teacher's lectures muddled, when she occasionally turned her face back and smiled at him. He also said how he often wanted to make an appointment with her for a happy date at an appropriate time. Finally, he also said that his mood lately was so irritable and depressed. Compared with when he usually saw what he loved toys or candy, there was a clear difference. That is, the desire for toys or candy could be immediately satisfied or eliminated, but now it could not be done immediately, and something like a snake was entrenched in his chest, feeling strangely suffocated.</p>
<p>"Confess it all!" The young man, sensing the surging emotions of the other party with his own burning eyes, said with sympathy and ridicule, "I'm very good at helping you think of a way, Old Wang has a lot of skills!"</p>
<p>Seeing Old Wang patting his chest, knowing that his happiness was at hand, the child bravely said, without any hesitation:</p>
<p>"Really? Don't mess around! I want to ask her to see a movie."</p>
<p>"Then just write another letter," Old Wang said with certainty.</p>
<p>"I'm just afraid she won't come out."</p>
<p>"Who said she won't come out?" A third voice suddenly came from behind.</p>
<p>The two young people turned their heads at the same time, and a classmate stuck out his tongue and made a face at the dean of students who came from the darkness.</p>
<h3>Year-End Signals</h3>
<p>— Bei</p>
<p>Time truly flies; after several urgent gusts of the old northerly wind, the year-end is almost upon us. According to past conventions, the period around the year-end is always very lively. This isn't to say that officials are busy acquiring properties, wealthy people are busy enjoying themselves, candy stores on Nanjing Road are packed with customers, dance halls and movie theaters are bustling until dawn, and everything is filled with laughter and excitement; rather, it refers to the universal clamor of pleading for loans, the fierce demands of debt collectors, the busy slaughtering of pigs on the streets, the frequent occurrence of thefts, and the tragedies and bloody incidents that arise from these.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the year-end approaches, while many people are cheering and singing wildly, many others are left in a state of mixed emotions, unsure whether to laugh or cry. It is a time of joy, but also a season of sorrow. Especially in a metropolis like this, the year-end is marked only by chaos, chaos, and more chaos. Our school cannot escape this fate either, as recent events powerfully demonstrate. This suddenly made me realize, alas, the year-end is here!</p>
<p>This isn't just my bad luck and financial loss; it's a reflection of the poverty of society. However, the unfolding of the facts has left me with a belly full of anger that I cannot vent. I haven't neglected my defenses; I always tell the school workers to be vigilant because thefts frequently occur in the school. Before going to the office, I always carefully close the windows and lock the doors. With such "precautions" in place, I shouldn't have to worry too much about my belongings in the room. Besides, I'm used to being casual, and my clothes are always "thrown around," tossed in corners, hung on walls, piled on the bed. At a glance, the room seems full of clothes, but there aren't really that many, and most of them are old and useless. Just recently, I made a huge decision—it took a lot of effort—to save up some money and make two suits. Because I usually wear tattered old clothes, having brand new suits, especially Western suits, naturally makes me value them immensely. Precisely because of this, I suppressed the urge to wear them, hanging them on the wall, looking at them from time to time, as if just looking at them satisfied my craving to wear them. Enough. That pair of Hailing pen brand suits, I've really only worn them twice; they're practically brand new.</p>
<p>The little thief who specializes in taking care of me really has sharp eyes, constantly watching me. Last time, he stole my fur coat, and now he's come to steal my suit. It's not that I neglected things, but my door lock isn't very secure. He took advantage of my absence at the office, and very calmly (I imagine he was very calm) picked my lock and walked away with my suit.</p>
<p>Good heavens, this really infuriated me; the suit was brand new!</p>
<p>However, this isn't just my bad luck and financial loss; it's a reflection of the poverty of society, or at least a common occurrence in a capitalist society like Shanghai, or at least an inevitable symptom in schools under the current education system. As the year-end approaches, theft has become a general trend of the season. In the past week, many similar thefts have occurred here. One classmate had his clothes stolen, and the thief even left</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>behind a note to play a joke on him. It is said that these thieves have significant backing. One was caught, and the result of the interrogation was that he was a university student. Alas, university education is ruined.</p>
<p>As the year-end approaches, how chaotic this society is!</p>

<h3>Questions About Recruiting Salespersons</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young man who has been unemployed for a long time. I worked as a salesman in a paper store for three years. Recently, I saw an advertisement in your newspaper from a certain sales company recruiting salespersons. I made an appointment with a friend to take the test together. We filled out applications there, submitted photos, and were asked a few questions by their staff. Finally, they replied with the simple sentence, "Whether or not you are accepted will be notified in writing later."</p>
<p>A dozen days later, the company indeed sent a letter: "Our company has already started working on the sixteenth. Please report for duty immediately upon receiving this letter, and bring one yuan for the badge fee." It was just a few simple words like that.</p>
<p>The next morning, I brought the original letter and went to report for duty with my friend. But when we got there, we saw that there were quite a few people reporting for duty, about one or two hundred. In the end, the people in the company said, "The money has been collected first, but the badges have not yet been made." This made people very suspicious, and seeing that the company had nothing of value, just a few desks for decoration, I didn't report for duty.</p>
<p>Editor: You are the mentors of young people in the professional world. I now have three points of doubt, please answer them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The company has no restrictions on recruiting salespersons. With so many unemployed people now, there must be a large number of applicants. Perhaps they are using this to collect money, which is not known.</p>
<p>(2) No one in the company is formally responsible. Those who greeted the applicants were all young people who looked like trainees, which clearly showed that there was no organization at all.</p>
<p>(3) The company is very dismissive of the guarantee issue and does not investigate it at all. With the heavy responsibility of a salesperson, not paying attention to this shows that they have other intentions.</p>
<p>The above three points are really doubts that I cannot resolve. I hope you will spare an hour and a half of your time to give me guidance so that I will not be deceived. If you think it is necessary, please publish it in the newspaper so that others can learn from it. A dollar for the unemployed is so important! Dear Sir: I am waiting for your reply! Wishing you</p>
<p>Well-being.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wang Qiheng, November 21st</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Wang's letter did not specify the name and address of the sales company, so it seems impossible to investigate the truth. Moreover, the situation described is not clear, so the editor cannot rashly make a judgment. However, in Shanghai, which is outwardly prosperous but internally dark, there are many deceptive businesses, and there is a risk of being harmed if one is slightly negligent. Mr. Wang's careful consideration after discovering suspicious points about the sales company is the right thing to do. Unemployed people should carefully examine all recruitment agencies that have no credit guarantee and focus on collecting money from applicants to avoid being deceived.</p>
<p>As for the sales company, if it believes that the situation described by Mr. Wang needs to be supplemented, it can send a letter to clarify. The editor will announce it within the possible scope.</p>

<p>Opening "Resist Japanese Goods"</p>
<p>Fusang three islands are rampant. Looking at them greedily like tigers and wolves. The Twenty-One Demands are unreasonable. The intention is to invade our rights and seize our territory. I remember on September 18th in the past year. The three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were occupied by robbers. Later, the situation in Rehe Province became tense again. In a few days, the Japanese dared to rob us. The Japanese are greedy and will not die, and their anger is even greater. Therefore, our people cannot bear it. They jointly planned to resist and came up with a long-term strategy. People from all walks of life have been dispatched to various places. Warn compatriots to work hard. Quickly recover the lost land. Unison singing is enthusiastic. It is pitiful that there is no way to appeal. Therefore, compatriots must resist imported goods. Cutting off his business is the best way. I am a small patriotic heart that has not died. Please listen carefully to a humble word. That is, perseverance, firmness and endurance. Don't be violent and cause discord. Never be enthusiastic for five minutes and then become cold. Being ridiculed and teased by foreigners is embarrassing. There is one more important thing. Improving domestic goods should be advocated first. We must know that the only way for a country to become rich is through industry. Everyone must do their best to help. If we can export high-quality goods that are better than Japanese goods. Cheap and beautiful, everyone praises it. If the source is cut off, there is no need to say more. Let him have trouble selling his goods and panic. The lost land will be recovered and the treaty will be destroyed. Compatriots have a good start and peace and health. Otherwise, it is empty words to resist and the call is urgent. Instead, the revival of domestic goods is put aside. If there is no way to get it, buy Western goods. Isn't it resisting Japanese goods and entering the West? Profits are still lost and the fat is exhausted. "Korea's example is inevitable to perish. I hope you will carefully consider this statement. I can comfort my writing of this long article.</p>

<p>It is really unexpected that Bai Guiying, who is used to eating and using, would actually start a family and save a lot of money. With such a virtuous helper, Yuhe can of course get some comfort in spirit. But what is the use of spiritual comfort? Rent is always needed, and meals are always needed. How can it be done without money?</p>

Taozhi thought in her heart that the anger she had suffered in Qingliang Mountain just now was better than going to Yuhua together to take those few lavish old men to vent her anger, so the two of them went to Yuhuachun together.</p>

<h3>Reasons Why Women Want to Be Performers</h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Everyone wants to be on stage or screen</p>
<p>Naturally good at pretending and imitating</p>
<p>"Women all over the world, deny it all you want, but if you use a microscope to examine you, you can see that every one of you has a thought in your mind to be a performer." The above is what an American star said. Of course, this situation is definitely true in America. When they are six or seven years old, they see Shirley Temple and want to be Shirley Temple themselves. At sixteen, they might want to be a small Vampa star, like Patrice Aries, showing off. At twenty-six, they want to be Joan Crawford or Jean Harlow. Even when they are over fifty, May Robson is their good example. As for those over sixty, it's the former Marie Dressler. Still did a movie queen after sixty? In the screen, the age limit can be said to be absolutely unique.</p>
<p>Female students, female salespersons, female receptionists, social women, professional women, family women, they all have the same thought - want to show off in the warm mercury lamps or behind the lamps. Performing, internal pretense, that is the most difficult and hard thing in the world, but if she is determined to be a female actor, she will go forward without hesitation, and no sacrifice or hardship can stop her from moving forward. Helen Hayes started performing on stage at the age of eight. Until now, her theatrical career has not stopped. Someone asked her why women have that kind of indomitable spirit. Helen smiled and said, "Why? Why do little girls who are not even big run to the empty room upstairs, find a silk dress, and dress up as a young lady? Isn't this a woman's natural psychology of imitation and acting"? But in order to act, to imitate, she is not afraid of hard work. Like Helen Hayes on the sound stage, surrounded by lights on all sides, so hot that she can't breathe, she still has to take pictures on the left and right. Isn't that too unworthy? But according to Helen Hayes, just dressing up and imitating is attractive enough.</p>
<p>But Lancel Dolores has a different view. Her view can be represented by a few words, that is, "Silver Fox Coat". Lancel Dolores said: "You all know that silver fox fur coats occupy a very important position in the minds of women. Well, if you want to wear a silver fox fur coat, you have to find a way to make money, and the best way to make money is to be a female actor! Diamonds are also women's favorite things, their weaknesses. In order to wear diamonds as jewelry, there is no better way than to be a female actor". Lancel's words are of course also a kind of experience. When she was a receptionist at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre, she had neither a silver fox fur coat nor diamond jewelry, but she was born a movie fan, and the movie star she admired the most was Gloria Swanson. She thought that being a receptionist at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre was the best place to be, because that was where Hollywood stars gathered. When leading them to their seats, she could either touch the silver fox fur coat they were wearing, or she could attract their attention, because she was born very well. Sure enough, she attracted the attention of others, and got a silver fox fur coat. Recently, she married a millionaire, and she can buy as many diamonds as she wants. Isn't this the reason why women want to be performers?</p>
<p>However, the desire of many women to be performers cannot be simply explained by "silver fox fur coats" or "diamonds." Several female actors' families were originally very wealthy. Some might as well find a wealthy millionaire to marry him, wouldn't that allow them to ask for anything they want? Therefore, Carole Lombard said: "The reason why women want to be female actors is because women want to be independent. Being a performer is the best way for them to be independent." You can rely on your beauty to coax your husband and ask him to take out money to make new clothes for you, but, Carole Lombard said: "How many women in the world are really happy to coax men and ask them to take out money to make new clothes? Wouldn't they rather have their own money and make their own new clothes? Being a performer is the way for women to be economically independent. She has her own money, so she doesn't have to bow her head and ask for help." According to Carole Lombard, not only can female performers be economically independent, but also housewives should be given salaries by their husbands every month, which is the remuneration they deserve for managing household affairs, so that they have the ability to be economically independent, so that they have their own money to buy clothes, shoes, socks, pocket money, etc., and do not need to reach out and smile to ask their husbands for money.</p>
<p>Of course, what is said above is not enough to include all the reasons why women want to be performers. Some are born with the ambition to be performers, and some use the shortcut of being performers to attract men. And being a performer also has a broad interpretation. Many ambitious women, although they do not go on stage or screen, can use the secrets of being performers to sensationalize society and influence politics. These cannot be explained in detail here.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Treasure Island"</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping, You Jing, Ling He</p>
<p>Treasure Island 丨 Nanjing 丨</p>
<p>Following several literary and artistic films, we have now watched the performance of "Treasure Island."</p>
<p>"Treasure Island" is a novel loved by the world, especially by children. It is even used as an English textbook in Chinese schools. Taking this opportunity to see it again on the screen, it is naturally a pleasure for us to have a deeper understanding and a more profound review of it.</p>
<p>Here, I feel it is necessary to briefly analyze the author first.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh in 1850. He fought poverty and disease throughout his life and died of lung disease on the remote Samoan island in the Pacific Ocean at the age of forty-four. He was an optimist. In the face of poverty and illness, he always lived bravely and happily, feeling joyful like "a king" as sung in his own poems . Until his death, he even wrote his own epitaph: "Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie. Glad did I live and gladly die, And I laid me down with a will."</p>
<p>Stevenson regarded life as just a game, in which we must play very seriously, always hoping for victory in a disciplined manner, and never despairing.</p>
<p>He was very talented in literature, using realistic groundwork and romantic techniques (transitioning from romanticism to realism) to depict the postures of various people in various places in a very delicate and moving way.</p>
<p>In his youth, he wrote stories about the Bible to tell his companions. In addition to "Treasure Island" and "Kidnapped," novels loved by children all over the world, there are legends such as "The Master of Ballantrae," "David Balfour," and ethical novels such as "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." There are also three volumes of short stories such as "New Arabian Nights," "The Dynamiter," and "Merry Men and Other Tales and Fables."</p>
<p>In the evolution of literature, Stevenson was quite behind compared to the writers of his time. While realism had become the main trend of the literary art at the time, he was still wandering between realism and romanticism, yearning for and reflecting the style of Scott. It was only the discovery of American literature that changed part of his writing methods. Similarly, his imaginary stories, he only wrote in a more bizarre and spicy way than the previous generation to make them more interesting.</p>
<p>Collins was able to describe a rogue. Where their evil deeds were heard, they were so personified that they became such grand and special villains, that the reader could not help but feel a natural pity. Such a villain is Count Fosco in Collins' "The Woman in White," and Long John Silver in Stevenson's "Treasure Island."</p>
<p>Obviously, from Jim's perspective, we can see Stevenson's subjective opinion:</p>
<p>In the relationship between the nobility (earls) and the commoners (pirates), the author uses the child Jim to convey his own views. In addition to maintaining the noble class, he also interestingly gives the pirates, even the villains, a personality of sympathy. After listening to Long John Silver's memories of pirate life and the tragic pain of hanging, Jim felt "the meaning of being in the same boat and the respect for adventurers," and humanely let him escape. As he said in his "The Sire de Malétroit's Door," "Two hours of life is two hours," and in the last paragraph of "Treasure Island," Long John Silver's theft of gold nuggets shows that "a pirate is still a pirate." The meaning of works such as "Robinson Crusoe" mainly lies in the initiation and encouragement of colonial aggression, and "Treasure Island" also undertakes this task in the same way. Regarding Smolle's erection of the British flag on the desert island, saying, "This is British land," and Jim's mouth saying, "God Save the Queen," when he pulled down the pirate flag. Also, regarding Long John Silver's farewell to Jim, saying, "You will have a bigger ship in the future, and you can discover more gold and silver," this is the way out the author pointed out to young people like Jim.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, "Treasure Island," like other literary and artistic films, only managed to faithfully adapt the original work.</p>
<p>Not at all harshly, Victor Fleming here did not relax his use of sound film techniques, but did not have a particularly great success either. Naturally, in this film, he has a heroic spirit, majestic rhythm, and solemn atmosphere, all of which cannot but coerce the audience's emotions. However, the earth-shattering power of "Don Quixote" or "Viva Villa!" is lacking in this film.</p>
<p>As for personal acting skills, the previous performances of Warner Oland, Lionel Barrymore, Jackie Cooper, and Lewis Stone can be guaranteed. In particular, Lionel Barrymore's scene when he first entered the hotel is particularly excellent due to the director's handling of the atmosphere. Others are omitted here due to space limitations.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Crime Doctor"</h3>
<p>— Shi Fu</p>
<p>"The Crime Doctor"</p>
<p>丨 Grand Shanghai Screening</p>
<p>This is a more meaningful murder detective case. From the script, it can open up new paths, have the spirit of a detective film, and interweave the philosophy of love. Roughly, there is a famous detective who wants to divorce because his wife loves someone else. On the surface, he is aware of the fate of love, but secretly he is jealous. So he hires a woman to secretly investigate the actions of his rival in love. Unexpectedly, this woman plans to blackmail his rival. Unfortunately, his wife finds out and asks him to handle this matter. So he borrows a knife to kill, steals his rival's gun, and beats the woman to death, making a plan to shift the blame to harm his rival. Because the arrangement is professional and thorough, the result of the investigation is that the rival is convicted. Even more unexpectedly, his wife believes that her lover is innocent and asks him to find a way to solve the case, and promises that if he can solve the case, she will not marry again, and is willing to stay with him forever. But this makes the great detective stuck. He also realizes that the fate of love is certain, so he has no choice but to confess and then commit suicide.</p>
<p>What the script gives us to ponder is that such a meticulous and calm great detective would not hesitate to commit crimes for jealousy. And if a woman loves a person wholeheartedly, no matter how much power you have, do not think about saving her. Although these things are not necessarily justified, if there is one of them, it can create the material for this film, let alone all of them. So in this script, it looks very simple on the surface, but in reality there is a lot of drama to be made.</p>
<p>The director's technique is very experienced, and there are very few redundant parts. Especially in the scenes where Detective Ford arranges the murder, it is straightforward and does not reveal the tragic state of the victim from beginning to end, which is also extraordinary. The dialogue is concise. The scene in the courtroom is very solemn and tense. Actor Otto Kruger's performance is calm and profound. The selection of the two female roles is also appropriate. There are no dull moments, but the most boring thing is the ending, which is a bit superfluous.</p>

<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Bigamy (2)</h3>
<p>— Dai Zhou</p>
<p>The money wired from his hometown to Shanghai made Wen Hua more depraved! Because he wanted to marry the socialite Xiang Qin, and prepare rings, etc., he sent a telegram home, asking for two thousand yuan, saying that he was going to become an official, and with two thousand yuan, he could take office. Wen Hua's father hurriedly sold all the accumulated grain and mortgaged the land, scraping together two thousand yuan and wiring it over. Wen Hua received the swindled money, rented an extremely luxurious house, and married the socialite Xiang Qin. The two sweetly slept on a wire bed. A month passed, and Wen Hua's parents in his hometown were extremely anxious amidst Wen Hua's sweet honeymoon. The neighbors all came to ask when Wen Hua would take office. The old people could not help but worry secretly: "It has been more than a month, why hasn't there been any news about Wen Hua taking office?" They sent a letter but received no reply. Wen Hua's mother anxiously said to her husband: "You should go there yourself! So you don't have to ask someone to write a letter! What is going on?" Like a heavy piece of lead, it pressed tightly on the hearts of the two old couples. Wen Hua's father took the train to Shanghai to find Wen Hua, found the private Yadong School of Law and Politics, but the messenger told him that Wen Hua had rented a house at No. 32 North Henan Road. He managed to ask his way along the address, and found a luxurious and novel Western-style house. He timidly patted the iron gate, and a young female servant flashed out from inside: "Who are you looking for?" Looking at his empty, ragged short coat and pants, he quickly said: "I'm looking for Huang Wen Hua, I'm his father, I have something to talk to him about." Wen Hua had already gone out. The female servant took him to see the hostess, the socialite Xiang Qin. At this time, she came out dressed. Seeing the ragged clothes of the person in front of her, which were beyond her expectations, she coldly spat out a puff of cigarette: "Are you Wen Hua's father? Where do you live? Wen Hua has gone out and hasn't come back yet." He told Xiang Qin that he was staying in a Shanghai hotel, and if Wen Hua came back, please tell him.</p>
<p>At the door, he met his son. Wen Hua was walking towards this side. Seeing his father, he was shocked and hurriedly dragged his father away. Xiang Qin saw Wen Hua's embarrassed appearance from the turret, and she suspected that Wen Hua must have lied to her. She hurriedly changed into a cheongsam and chased him to the Shanghai hotel, opened a room next to Wen Hua's father, and eavesdropped on Wen Hua's father's voice through the crack in the wall: "When are you going to take office? The money at home is almost used up, your wife..." From these words, Xiang Qin felt that Wen Hua had indeed deceived her. She angrily left the Shanghai hotel. Late at night, Wen Hua returned with a relieved face. Xiang Qin deliberately asked with a smile: "Who was that country bumpkin who came today?" Wen Hua was embarrassed for a moment, then smiled and said: "That's my family's servant, he came to ask me to go back and divide the property. Oh, I have to tell you, I have to go back to my hometown!" The day after Wen Hua returned home, Xiang Qin chased him to this Fanchuan Village. At that time, many villagers were congratulating Wen Hua on becoming an official. She walked into the house, and met Wen Hua's wife, Xiu Feng. Seeing Xiang Qin's strange clothes, she hurriedly asked: "You're looking for Wen Hua, who exactly are you to Wen Hua?" Xiang Qin looked at Xiu Feng straightforwardly and said: "I am his wife, we got married in Shanghai." Xiu Feng's face suddenly turned pale when she heard this: "Then you have been deceived by him, I am his wife, we have been married for almost a year!"</p>
<p>Two lawsuits were opened in the solemn courtroom: Xiu Feng accused Wen Hua of abandonment, demanding a divorce and compensation of five thousand yuan. Xiang Qin accused Wen Hua of bigamy, demanding compensation for losses of ten thousand yuan. The judge asked Wen Hua: "Do you admit it?" Wen Hua nodded miserably and was imprisoned, sentenced to one year and six months. He miserably recalled the past. This irreversible depravity! The family went bankrupt; the savings of his father's decades of sweat and blood, and the son's dream of studying and succeeding were also shattered! He shed tears, sadly pacing on the field ridges——</p>
<p>The scenery of Fanchuan Village is still as beautiful as a poem, shrouded in the slanting rays of the setting sun. (The End)</p>
