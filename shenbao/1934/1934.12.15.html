<p>時評</p>
<h3>廣李馥蓀君之重農説源</h3>
<p>金融界先進李馥蓀君。自海外考察歸來。發表『國際形勢與中國出路』一文。扼其要旨。謂吾國應集中力量。以最經濟最謹嚴之方法。使主要農產物足以处給。並能輸出其有餘。以减少入超。若是則國民經濟上最嚴重之貿易入超問題及金融問題。均可迎刃而解。至於工業。則除現有工廠應竭力扶助獎勵外。其有資本較巨而尙在計劃中者。不如訂立適宜之程序。歡迎外國資本合作。關於李君引用外資説。非在本文範圍内。可置勿談。至李君重農之説。我人認爲復興農村。增加生產。實爲當務之急。毋容懷疑。今欲與李君並吾讀者商榷者。卽應如何始可達此目的是已。</p>
<p>我人以爲第一應爲求農村秩序之安靖。蓋惟地方安靖。而後農民可以生聚耕耘。從事生產。今以全國論。自赤匪剿滅後。農村秩序大體已較前爲安謐。但間有因受旱災影響。致少壯挺而走險。擾害隣村者。此則以政府與慈善團體之振濟。地方警力之維持。不難予以安息。又有因土豪劣紳。把持鄉政。魚肉農民。致農民被逼而醖釀蠢動者。此其無形的攪亂秩序。實更甚於盜匪。自更有待於政府最嚴厲之處置也。惟貪官汚吏去。惡劣勢力滅。而後農民可安居樂業也。</p>
<p>第二爲農村金融之調劑。播種之前。農民需欵。以購種子。旣耕之後。又需欵以購肥料。收穫之時。需欵以僱臨時帮工。旣穫之後。又需欵以爲運儲之需。凡是所需。向者或求典質於當舖。或乞借於個人。或押貨於糧行。要皆利息奇昂。條件苛刻。而債主更或乘火打刦。假債務爲壓迫之工具。以達其將農產物賤價收買之目的。以是農民終歲勤勞。結果爲債主作牛馬。本身一無所獲。此爲吾國農村崩潰之最大原因。亦爲今日政府與社會最所關懷之事、至於擁有實力確能予以解决之者。除政府外。惟金融界耳。往者金融業者類多以都市爲唯一投資塲所。而地產公債又爲其投資之標的。對於農民貸欵。則以爲卽瑣碎而又不可靠。鮮有注意者。不知若干年來。如中國華洋義振會之農村信用合作貸欵。國民政府救濟水災委員會之農振貸欵。溧水農民借貸所之農民個人直接借欵。寗屬農民救濟協會之農民倉庫押欵等。皆有良好成績。農民到期將本利清償。鮮有拖欠者。農民信用之可靠。應爲吾人所公認。夫以欵直接借與個人。其所負投資之危陯或較大。但若全國農民皆有合作社之組織。凡一社員之借欵。由其所屬合作社全體社員爲之擔保。則投資於農村。必爲最穩妥者矣。然農民合用社之組織。非政府一紙命令所能奏效。亦非地方官吏所能辨理。必有待乎金融業者爲之引導而組織之。苟金融業者能全體出動。旣示農民以大信。曰。我可貸汝以所需之金。又告之曰。汝需如是如是而組織合作社。則短時間内。合作社可成爲農民普遍之組織。農村貸欵將成爲投資最穩妥之標的。結果。現銀可散佈於全國。不復壅塞於都市。而農民得經濟上之援助。亦不難增加生產。提高生活程度。誠如李君所謂。『目下國民經濟上最嚴重之貿易入超問題。金融問題。均可迎刃而解也。』</p>
<p>第三則爲交通與運輸之便利。李君文中嘗剴切言之曰。『運輸事業自須求其發展。否則生產雖增。而盈虚不劑。亦屬徒然。』蓋以全國民食論。虚盈調劑。首賴各地方之交通便利。不幸而交通阻塞。則農民辛苦得來之產物。不得向外銷售。又將何以維持生計而償付債務。一鄕之農如此。則一鄉危。全國農村如此。則全國危矣。本年旱災爲患。若干受災縣鄉。顆粒無收。固不待論。卽有收穫在七成以上者。亦以榖價奇賤。無不虧累。卽以江蘇爲證。若干縣鄉之榖價。每擔僅三元餘。而上海米價則每擔常在十三元左右。洋米洋麥源源而來。同在一省之内。而盈虚失調之弊如是。此卽交通不便運費高昂。有以致之也。是故應與增進生產同時努力者。厥爲交通。以運輸方法論。惟水道爲最低廉。鐵道較昂。汽車道爲最貴。年來各省公路之與築。已有驚人之成績。鐵道之開展。亦在積極提倡中。此皆爲我國人重視交通建設之表現。深可令人樂觀者也。李君謂『運輸工具之建設。仍須無背於重農政策。運輸工具之作用。尤貴能疎通農產之重任。』則今茲以往。願吾國人於河道水利。更加注意。不獨巨河大江。應隨時疏浚。卽支流渠溝。亦應疏通開引。此其功用。不獨便利交通。减輕運價。亦所以增加水量之儲蓄。供灌漑之用也。最近蔣委員長曾通令全國各省府。飭限各縣儘兩個月内。具報地方建設實施計劃。甚願各縣本此通令之意旨。特别注意於水利之建設也。</p>
<p>此外。我人認爲復興農村之必要條件者。尚有廢除苛捐雜税之一端。財政當局。已决定將若干國税劃入地方税。以裕地方收入。同時又着各省縣設立捐税監理委員會。以民衆力量監督廢除苛雜之實行。可謂面面俱到者矣。</p>
<p>在前述各項條件中。第一第三第四項。有關於地方秩序水利建设與廢除苛雜之進行。願吾中樞當局與地方人員共同努力。第二項之金融接濟。則惟金融界是賴矣。按財政部儲蓄法第七條第八欵曾明白規定。儲蓄銀行對於農村合作社之質押放欵及以農產物爲質之放欵之總額。不得少於存欵總額五分之一。願我金融界不獨在法令範圍之内。盡其責任。且能更進一步。組織農民經濟機構。扶助生產。一旦農村復興。生產增加。金融穩固。則國基之奠定。可以立待。然則金融界之責任。亦重矣哉。</p>

<p>三國代表球塲折衝</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦海軍談話方將休會、忽有新發展、美日代表聞皆就商英代表、以期獲得將來可能的雙方協定、昨美日代表與客談話時皆否認會圖發起英日聯盟或英美恊調之説、惟外交界則謂、當三方談話顯將趨入延會之一途、忽有發展、英國現不亟亟於此時開談此事、另據日代表團消息、山本在休會期内不致返國、將留寓英倫、但須觀目下之談話有無績作或一九三五年海軍會議有無於　五月間在倫敦舉行之可能爲决、（十四日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美代表展期歸國謂係外交策略</h3>
<p>日以會議失敗責歸美</p>
<p>美代表變計敗日陰謀</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今晨英相麥唐納與美國首席代表臺維斯會晤以後、一般人似已明瞭近數日來海軍談話會外之種種事變、乃純係英國創議之結果、據美國方面宣稱、英相麥唐納曾自動向臺維斯建議、請美國代表團於本星期杪啟程返國、麥唐納謂、就實質而論、吾人倘於日本宣告廢止華盛頓海約以後宣佈海軍談話無限期延會、則海軍軍備限制之原則勢將消滅、必爲世界輿論所不直、故不如在談判現階段内、立卽宣佈延會、另就外交途徑、繼續磋商、以謀與日本尋覓一般諒解之基礎、較爲得計云、麥唐納又謂、談判延期後、日本首席專門委員山本雖仍留倫敦、然僅限於交換技術方面之意見、不必有所過慮、至於英美兩國對於華盛頓條約若干主要原則、則態度仍屬一致云云、麥唐納此項提議殊爲動聽、因此美國代表團已預定艙位、决定本星期六返國、然嗣後忽又變計、延緩行期、此則乃由兩種事實之所致、其一由於各報紛紛議論、欲以海軍談話突然停頓之責任諉諸美國、惟美國代表團對於此種議論立卽加以否認、並力予辦正、其二、山本發表之談話中、表示日本政府將再有所表白有此二種事實、故今晨麥唐納會見臺維斯發表宣言時、臺維斯卽答稱、美國代表團不及摒擋一切、星期六日開行之船已不及動身、現須搭十二月二十九日開行之船啟程返國、在此期前、吾人仍可隨時承敎云、一般人現有一種印象、以爲美國代表團此種應付手段、已獲得局部之成功、蓋日本代表團於昨晚宣稱、東京政府之訓令頃刻間卽可送到、但直至本日午後、東京政府尙無表示、對於日本代表團所詢應否變更最初立塲一節遲遲未復、據美國代表推想、日本代表團必已於昨晚接到東京政府訓令、但同時奉命須俟美國代表啟程後方將此項訓令發表、藉以諉其責任於美國、今美國代表團改變計畫、延緩返國、則日本此種企圖已歸失敗、昨晚美國某代表語人、海軍談判形勢仍與昨日以前之情形相同、惟吾人頃已避免美國歷史上最大之一外交錯誤云、美日互玩外交手腕之内幕當可於此一語中得之矣、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據此間今日報紙消息、英首相麥唐納與美代表臺維斯已議定倫敦海軍預備會議於十二月二十日正式休會、惟悉英美日代表仍將繼續非正式談話、以俟來年春季重開會議、臺維斯氏曾於昨日開會時宣稱、如無另立海軍條約之希望、則美國代表將不再返倫敦、彼並請英國贊同於美國代表退出後之交涉由三國外交途徑進行、茲悉、麥唐納與臺維斯二氏絶未談及明年之海軍會議、日本代表則要確定重開日期、爲贊成今次談話暫停之條件、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>山本與英參謀長商定妥協案説</h3>
<p>日電所傳内容</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日代表山本少將十三日訪問英海軍部參謀長蔡德飛、會售内容未經發表、美國代表團從來聲稱日本無建設的態度、且非難其拒絶明示具體的數字之點、謂日本如不改其態度、不必重開會談、山本會見蔡德飛、似表示日本不明示具體數字之理由　並希望繼續會談、訂立新恊定、（二十三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　山本代表山本少將與英國參謀部長蔡德飛恊定之妥恊案内容如次、</p>
<p>（一）日本根基於英國曾提出之妥恊案、承認海軍力平等原則、</p>
<p>（二）各國在將來數年間自動宣布自國建艦計劃、</p>
<p>（三）宣言内容廢止比率主義、不受條约或其他國際束縳、</p>
<p>（四）英國不反對建艦計劃、决定最高限度之提案、</p>
<p>（五）英國因其領土散在全球、主張小艦多數主義、</p>
<p>（六）以上項理由、對於各種軍艦加以三成之質的縮減、卽規定主力艦二萬五千噸、航空母艦二萬噸、巡洋艦七千噸、而將縮减之數通融、於巡洋艦建造七千噸、巡洋艦七十艘、並希望縮减現有勢力之幾分、作爲最高限度、</p>
<p>（七）日本得保有與英國同等之海軍勢力、然由現在狀態一舉達至上述勢力、事實上不可能、故逐年實行造艦、以達目的、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<h3>休會與否現待日本表示</h3>
<p>山本留英觀望</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美國代表團主張繼續會談之結果、英國休會計劃完全失敗、不得不决定如次三項根本問題、（一）繼續會談、（二）宣告休會、明年再開、（三）解散會議、英國待東京政府對於山本蔡德飛兩人造成妥恊案之回訓以後、决定此問題、如日本政府承認妥恊案、同意日英繼續會談、則撤回休會之提議、續行會談、否則不得不宣告無期休會、（十三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　山本代表現以英國政府所提之停會方案、其後漸次發生變化、故將歸國之一切準備决計中止、暫行觀望形勢、如日本政府之回訓、令其於冬至節後續行會商、或在一九三五年五月以前正式會議有開會之希望、則擬留住英國云、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　英於十一月提議談判休會、明年三四月再開、外務省接到松平代表公電後、卽與海軍省恊議、决定回訓如下、今夜或明日中發出、（一）贊成休會、但日本之新軍縮案甚完備、十一年前之華盛頓條約不合時勢、如英美願承諾日本提案、日本卽有提示具體數字之準備、（二）雖日本提案未能爲英美所承諾、日本不斷念、仍欲繼續交涉、至貫澈主張後休、（十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　美國代表預定十五日歸國、據報現已延期、日海軍當局對該報告觀測如下、美國方面之普减二成以及初步談話决裂之責任論等、均係欲阻止日本通告廢約、及知日本通告廢約之堅决意志時、欲將日本方面之通告與代表歸國等之决裂責任、歸日本負之、英方觀此情形、遂提議欲於日本通告前之二十日休會、代表若在期前歸國、則中止談話之責任不能不由美方負之、故延期於通告後歸國、設發生責任論時、謂因日本之通告、致發生新事態、意欲將責任轉嫁日本、再美方代表之延期歸國、似欲觀测山本與蔡德飛所進行恊和私案之結果、以資今後對策之意、（十四日電通電）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能羞任敎平視西賓何足貴空辱虚心</p>
<p>月英也不認識這是什麽綢子的，不過看到顔色那樣的鮮艷，條紋那樣的細緻，那凖是綢料的。就是頭邊兩個枕頭、也不像生平所見的，這是長方的，中間微微的鼓了起來。平常所看到的藍布枕頭、總是漆黑油膩了一片、唯有這個是白的不見半縷灰塵。而且那床上微微的還透出一些香氣來。有錢的人，就是這樣的享福，這是内地人所想不到的，天上果然有神仙的話，神仙所享的福，也不過是這樣吧？他在這裏擬想着，不由得推想到神仙頭上去，看了那床、有些出神。賈多才始而是没有注意。還是踱着方步子，來來去去。在三個人都不説話的當中。經過了兩三分鐘的沉默，他偶然對於月英加以注意、這就看到了。一個少女注意着一個男子的床，這似乎不必怎樣去研究，就可以知道所以然，因之他也不怎樣的驚動他、只是微笑而已。還是坐在一邊的胡嫂子，經過了許久的考量，却是有些忍耐不住，就輕輕的咳嗽了兩聲。只是這咳嗽聲，不是由嗓子眼裏出來的，是由嘴裏咳嗽出來的，這也可見極勉强而不自然，但是賈多才明白了他的用意，乃是要説話，先知會一下子的意思，就掉過頭來向他望着。胡嫂子笑道··賈老爺。説着·又咳嗽了兩聲。賈多才道··這裏就是我們三個人，有什麽話，你就只管説罷。胡嫂子站起來，又坐下，才笑道··你只看這姑娘多麽温柔，眞是西邊來的，西安城裏可不多見，你若是青那個，不但是救了他一家人，就是我也蒙你救了一把，他一家三口，住在我家裏，我眞是不得了。（九０）</p>
<h3>戀愛新訣</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>從動物的通例看來，大都雄性比雌性美麗些，或是雄壯些·，説是因此雄性可以博得雌性的歡心。事實上，雄性是有求於雌性的，假如不能博得雌性的歡心，蠻幹當然辦不成「交易」。所以雄性必得比雌性美麗些，尤其是雄壯些！</p>
<p>人，當然也是動物·，得現在的「文明世界」是顚倒了，女的大都生得妖形怪狀，着得肉感香艷·可是男的也不廿示弱，仍能打扮得富麗堂皇，神氣活現。這纔呌做「匹敵」！這纔够得上兩性間追逐的資格！</p>
<p>可是現在講究戀愛的靑年們，似乎僅注意到油頭粉面西裝革覆等等外表的美，對於名字的美化、就不大注意。前天有位朋友給我介紹一個透頂漂亮的靑年，但他所有的漂亮，統給他的名字糟掉·，原來他姓范名通。我當時很奇怪，如何這麽漂亮的靑年、會有這麽不漂亮的姓名！</p>
<p>從前米南宮有個才貌雙絶的女兒，因他老人家一生有種「潔癖」總説世間的男子大都骯髒得很，不能匹配他的女兒！所以擇婿奇嚴。後來遇個靑年，驚其丰神卓絶，與語大悦！問其姓字，姓段名拂，字去塵，他老先生拍着手説··「旣拂矣丨又去塵丨眞吾婿也」。隨以女妻之。假使那靑年姓「段」名「命」則「大大事」去矣！</p>
<p>世有欲得才貌雙絶之老婆者乎丨則於西裝革覆之外，雖説「賊不改姓」·名字總得力求「美化」纔好哪！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳藴案）</p>
<p>當夜之網撒下後都市裏的男女，便開始像軍隊似的動員來。</p>
<p>在有書讀的時候，儘管不讀，没書讀的時候，却拼命要讀，這是何等矛盾的心理，</p>
<h3>髮網</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>本報本市新聞曾載有「歐美人士歡迎我國髮網」消息，大致謂此國羅曼白蘭公司有函託國際貿易局介紹出品云去云·，我因此想及二十年前在山東濟南所見着的千千萬萬的髮網了。</p>
<p>那年秋冬之交，濟南某洋行需要大批髮網，華經理遂兼營此事。他一方面紛託所謂掮客，徴收物品·，一方面又在昌欒等處，設有坐莊收買。洋行裏又特立一部，專管收貨檢貨事宜。這，可以想見髮網這樣東西，的確爲歐美人士所歡迎的了。當時洋行門首，只見一批一批的髮網，肩挑背負地送進去·，經過檢交之後，又見一批一批地打成包裹，送往郵局，分寄各國·，非常熱閙。同時，在烟臺，外國人也有在那裏專收髮網，其熱閙亦不亞於濟南。</p>
<p>髮網的式樣，大多數是圓形的·，顔色，大多數是烏黑的。它雖有大有小，但呎吋俱有規定。編個髮網，在我們外行人看來，似乎是很麻煩的。薄薄的網兒，要疊一百四十層，方成一完全的髮網。爲便於檢查起見，每十二層疊爲一組，所以一個髮網，亦可稱爲「一羅」卽One　gross　是。</p>
<p>髮網由華經理手交給外國人後，卽開始加以棆騐。产行中闢有一室，專雇着許多工人丨男女俱有丨管理此事。檢騐的標準是·，貨色合不合，換言之，卽質地好不好·，質料有無偷减，卽是否「一羅」·，顔色是不是一樣，因髮網不僅是黑色的，棕色的，紫色的，黄色的，甚至是白色的俱有，如果一個髮網裏配以雜色，就不合了·，網眼有無破斷·，這，如小有毛病的，由女工人修補，否則卽要退回。</p>
<p>因上述的關係，加以行市亦有漲落，故華經理非有經騐的，也不易賺到外國人的錢！</p>
<p>— 彤父</p>
<h3>臉譜</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>人心不同如其面，千萬人有千萬人的面貎，雖然攣生的姊妹兄弟，畢竟不多處賁中郎之似。那末，要寫「臉譜」，談何容易。</p>
<p>但，籠統來説，還可以寫出幾隻「臉譜」來·，圓渾渾臉部的輪廓，多數是富商貴官，鋭角形尖瘦的輪廓，上部披了蓬蓬的髮，下部生了鬑鬑的鬚·，不是藝術家，便是癟三。甚麽眉清目秀的「小白臉·，」賊頭賊腦的「鬼臉」·，頤指氣使，搖搖擺擺的架子臉」·，巧言令色，擠眉弄眼的「馬屁臉」·，鶴髮鷄皮的「蟹殻臉」：，冰清玉潔的「孤孀臉」……這些不是有一定的「臉譜」嗎？</p>
<p>自言蒙了眼接吻，能知女性國籍的法國大小説家，德哥派拉先生説·，「江浙女人面部的輪廓，往往和圓的大餅相似，颧頭部分，擴展的特别寛，若再加上一個扁形的鼻子，那就成爲一個「塌餅了。這種臉面所表示的特性，是老實，忠厚，智慧技巧的缺乏，和征服男性的無能。另一種，就是中國人所謂的「瓜子臉」，也是以顴骨外擴爲特徴，兩頰以下，慢慢的尖窄·，把整個的臉部，形成了一個三角形。這種面型所表示的特性，不是聰明，不是莊重，而是輕佻跟浮薄吧了。」無論那位小説家評判咱們貴國女人的臉型·是不是合理·，女人的臉譜，却是給他描畫得淋漓盡致了。</p>
<p>面相有關於人的休咎吉凶，咱是不相信的。但，關個个性，確有些講究。所以，平劇裏的「臉譜」，都是這人個性的標幟。小丑是小花，大面是大花，白粉描的越多，其人越是不堪。弔紅黑臉的，不是莽夫，便是盜賊。一個人毋須戴上「假面具」自已不知不覺地會弔臉的·，鼻上花的，滿臉白的，眼上紅的，額上黑的，頰上靑的，人家瞧得明明白白咧！</p>

<h3>科學化之波蘭總統</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>各國現任大總統有爲文學家，法學家，敎育家等，而以世界大科學家頭銜，握一國之行政權者，首推波蘭大總統莫息斯基氏。前美國大總統胡佛，雖出身爲礦務工程師，一度任職我國開灤礦務局，但投入政界後，即未從事礦業，與莫息斯基仍繼續不斷孜孜研究科學者，情形亦復不同。本月七日爲莫氏在化學上發明成功之三十週年紀念，本埠中國科學社，中華學藝社，及科學化運動會等均有函電馳賀，敎育部長王世杰，亦電波使魏登濤致賀，足證莫氏在科學界功績之偉大。按莫氏現年六十七歲，生於一八六七年，初求學於波京華沙，旋入里加工業專門學校，成績冠全校，畢業後投身愛國志士所組幾之政治團體，奔直呼號，謀所以奪回俄國暴力宰割下之波蘭独立政權，故莫氏行動，漸爲俄政府所注意，終乃被迫亡命國外，首至倫敦，任職化學實騐室主任，在倫敦與另一波蘭政治亡命者普爾蘇斯基將軍相遇，志同道合，漸成莫逆，而波蘭獨立運動之成功，實胚胎於斯。莫氏爲一化學家。經孜孜不斷之研究，榮譽遍於各國，瑞士弗利堡大學遂聘爲敎授，在校發明硝酸等。一九一二年莫氏改任波蘭路奥大學敎授，在校有特種蓄電器之大發明，使廣播無線電得驚人之進展，舉世科學家咸爲欽佩。今日巴黎法國無線電台所用之最有力蓄電器，即鐫有莫氏姓名，嗣後益努力深求迄未間斷，在石油，硝酸，鋁等各種物質内，迭有新發明。大戰後，波蘭恢復獨立，莫氏任朝坐地方製造硝酸等大工廠之總經理，業務日益發達，一九二六年波總統改選，莫氏在國會中以得票最多當選。任内莫氏以大公無私之人格，使其政敵咸爲感化，一九三三年任滿，復以最多數票連任，莫氏雖爲行政領袖，暇時仍繼續爲化學之研究，年事雖高，精神彌佳，諴足爲吾國靑年師法也。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>此外，尚有兩具大玻璃盒收藏着同治所玩弄過的各樣玩具··小弓，小箭，泥人，木馬，扯鈴之類，差不多是應有盡有··但都極平常，不見什麽特色。我們看了，都覺得很失望，想不到一個小皇帝的玩具，也衹是和我們小時候所有的恩物相等。不過後來終於給我們發現了一件比較不平凡的東西，那是一頭泥製的小兎··外面塗着很光亮的白溙，形態也塑得十分生動，還有兩顆鮮紅的眼珠，令人一見油然生愛。太后似乎也在那裏找它，一找到它便把伊的視線集中着不動了，伊足足注視了七八分鐘之久·才吩咐李連英輕輕地將那匣盒揭起·讓伊親自伸手進去檢出了那泥兎來。待伊把這泥兎取出來之後，我們方才眞正認識了這件玩具的優點··原來它不僅是外貌特别的可愛了，而且還有一些小小的機關裝置着咧！這機關是藏在它肚子裏的，而用一根短短的紅線，打它的背脊上穿出來。人只須把這根釘線一抽，它那二隻鮮紅的眼珠，便立刻會轉動了，同時，還有半截紅舌，打它的嘴裏吐出來·，如其把這根紅綫不住的抽，那末它的眼珠也就不會停住，它的紅舌，更會一伸一縮的吐弄個不休。太后是知道這機關的、伊便把那紅線抽了幾下，我們瞧得險些笑出來了··可是太后却一些没有歡喜的樣子，而且是更沉鬱了。伊　自捧着這一個泥兎呆呆地站着，什麽話都没有··　到隔了許久，伊才慢慢地説道··「這是好　年以前的事情了·他總　弄這個兎兒。」（二００）</p>

<p>申報無線電週刊最新雙孿五極管  李元慶　　在四極眞空管屏極與簾栅極的中間，加裝一個抑制栅極，（Suppressor　grid)卽爲五極管。此第五極之功用，能避免屏極因衝擊過甚而散射之二次電子。結果，五極管的放大力，便於以大著。現在新式收音機的末級代週率放大，大槪没有不用五極眞空管的。　　最近英國新出二種雙孿五極管，（Twin　Pentode)是將二隻五極管合而爲一的，其功效之偉大，更遠在普通一般五極管之上。第一圖　　第一種是英國麥氏達（Mazda)廠的出品，眞空管號數爲ＱＰ２４o，底座共有九脚，（見第一圖）絲極電流約爲０．４安培，簾栅極與屏極的電壓均爲Ｉ５０弗打。内部兩個簾栅極，分裝於兩個底脚上，因此，簾栅極上可任意加上不同的電壓，以配合各種的用途。兩屏極之輸出總阻，約爲２０，０００歐姆。屏流總值約爲３．８　安培，輪出電力約爲１．３華脱，輸入變壓器之比率約爲１：８。第二圖　　第二種是馬可尼（Marconi）與亞司令（Osram）廠的出品，眞空管號數爲Ｑp2r。内部搆造大致相同，衹是將二個簾栅極連在一起，以及抑制栅極連在燈絲上，這樣，眞空管的底脚，便减爲七隻。（請參閲第二圖）輸出電力約有二華脱。　　上述二種，雙孿五極管，最適宜於“Ｂ”類放大。（“Ｂ”類放大，在英國稱爲静止推挽式。Quiescent　push-pull眞空管號數前冠以ＱＰ二字母，卽係原文之縮寫。）Ａ，Ｂ，Ｃ電源，均可採用電池供給。電壓表自製法  宋劍琴　　弗打表在無綫電工程中亦是一件不可少的儀器，普通的美貨或德貨非化七八元錢不能到手。故爲經濟和研究方面着想，决意將舊廢聽筒一只改造。費去二晚工夫，纔告成就、成績到亦不差，故敢介紹與同好。圖一圖二　　圖一Ａ用名片紙製成的綫圈紙心，尺寸如圖所示，將舊聽筒内二綫球的綫盡繞其上，Ｂ爲薄鐵片剪成，正中用針打一細孔，Ｃ亦可用名片紙剪之，用極薄鋁片更佳，其大端相距一分處亦打一細孔。Ｄ爲針鎈斷，長約三分，二頭鎈成鋒尖。Ｅ用薄銅片剪成。長一時一分，灣成如圖，二端距頭半分處用小洋釘各打一凹穴，愈深愈妙，但不可打穿，次將ＢＣ用膠水粘成十字形，再將Ｄ三分之一穿於兩細孔内膠固，一部手續已畢，次爲較騐指針的平衡重量。其法先將Ｄ之二端夾於Ｅ之二凹穴中，使其相接極鬆，指針轉動自如，而不使其二端脱出凹穴，轉側Ｅ，則指針尖端必因重而下垂，此時用香烟鍚紙一細條，繞粘於其大端，使其平衡爲度，（因指針平衡，則裝就後此表無諭倒側、均不致指針脱離零度，）再用厚紙或膠板一小方如圖二的裝法，先將Ｅ之下邊膠於厚紙上，再將綫圈平置於Ｅ之旁，用紙條壓住二端粘於厚紙上，此時指針之後端正在綫圈之孔心内，須左右移動不生接觸，圖中Ｍ爲舊聽筒中取出之磁石，亦用膠水粘於厚紙下，如圖之位置，此時指針因Ｍ吸Ｂ之二端故必指於某點，Ｐ爲一白紙粘於厚紙上，可依指針的尖端劃一六七十度的弧綫。圖三　　最後的較整手續，借標準弗打表及電壓交換器一只，扁電四節。串連成Ｉ８Ｖ	，如圖三接法。Ａ爲標準表，Ｂ爲自製表，轉動交換器使標準表指一弗打，則自製表所指之處亦卽一弗打，（其原指之處爲零弗打）以鉛筆記之，依此較準完善爲止。此表卽可應用。　　如量知其綫圈之歐姆數，再串一本身九倍之歐姆數之耗阻Ｒ。則可量至十倍弗打數矣。（注··較整時，如指針反動、將二綫頭交換卽可。）低週率放大交連電路  劉同康　　（甲）變壓器交連　　此式交連法爲普通應用最廣者，如圖一所示，惟變壓器之電壓比率不可超出一定限度，不然變壓器初級之廻阻將漸次增大而又富於分佈電容量，卽將發生並聯諧振作用，乃對於諧振週率之左近，放大效能極大，而對於其他週率則否，如是則變壓器升降比率愈高，次級分佈電容最愈大、諧振週率之放大效能則更强、而平均放大之範圍反爲狹窄，故足以使言語音樂之各週率殊難得相等之放大，致發生音所失眞之現象，此卽變壓器交連之缺點。此外如吾人採用四五極管作檢波，以其交流屏阻極大，故屏電路所接電阻亦將增大，以免喪失其放大率，然實際採用變壓器交連後，以其初級之阻力甚小，當然難以保持其固有之一定放大效能。此爲其缺點二。圖一圖二　　此式交連法，固有上述之缺點，然其優點亦復不少，品質優良之變壓器，以其諧振現象不甚顯着，故其放大率可不因週率之大小而異，而在一週率帶内之放大效能可絶對均匀，此外因其初級阻力甚小，故可不需極高之乙電供給屏極，此式如應用於三極作檢波時，則以三極管之交流屏阻亦甚小，可使放大率增至最大極限也。且如欲收音機之輸出力强大，亦須採用此式交連法作推挽式放大，如圖二。（待續）小經騐不用變壓器的低週率振盪器  李元慶　　常用的低週率振盪器，大槪是利用低週率變壓器，時常容易斷綫，拆換修理，頗覺費事，這是牠的缺點。　　我們知道，再生式收音機是僅能產生高週率振盪的，現在却有方法能使牠產生低週率振盪。我們在繞再生圈的時候，衹要我繞十幾圈就行。使用時加强再生力，至超過某一點時，聽筒中便引起一種狂呌。此種呌聲，週率極高，聽來非常悦耳·，普且牠的響度，也超出普通利用變壓器製成的振盪器之上。如果拿來做電碼練習器，不僅經濟耐用，並且重　和地位，也大爲减少。修理中間週率變壓器之簡法  史古　　現在外差式收音機盛行，他的收音幾敏和選擇性優良，是最使吾人滿意的。不過無論收音機怎樣好，終不免要損壞。外差式收音機裏，别的東西損壞了尙易配購，唯有中間週率雙壓器，最是困難。他要誘導率大。直流阻力小，潛佈電容量小，地位要小。所以我的一付收音機，因爲他損壞了，修來修去，總是成績不好，最近到亞美公司配些材料，看見有蜂房式的高週率阻流綫圈，因爲他的構造和中週率樓壓器所用的一樣，價錢衹有一元半，就想賈一只去試試，所以揀了一只較大的（十　亨利I0MH，）因爲圈數多些，若太大可以拆去幾圈，拿回去一裝，成績也平平，後來一圈一圈的拆，哈哈！拆到一個時候，成績竟好極了。同志中如果碰到這種困難，請不妨一試。消息　　吉而文收音機承電影明星胡蝶女士之歡迎··吉而文收音機係南京路史德華公司所經理，機器監固，聲音響亮，近影星胡蝶女士購得一具，極稱滿意，晚間曾收到歐洲各國播音，清晰一似滬上，嘆爲極品，特修專函史德華公司致謝，茲聞該公司新闢之修理部營業甚盛，凡來敝部索得優待劵者，均可亨九折利益，如需該劵諸君儘可函索或面索也。招請　　招請無綫電修理員　兹欲請經騐豐富之無綫電修理及裝配等職員數人，其待遇論月論件均可，如確能勝任者，請開明履歷及希望寄虹口塘山路，業廣里一一八號金君接洽（面洽概不招待。）收音機上日常遇到的困難和補救法（續）  振民　　（三）眞空管燒燬　　原因　　補救的主法　　（一）板極（Plate）與燈絲間的短路　視察所有的綫路，也許是綫圈間的短路，設法把牠更換。　　（二）絶緣不佳　檢察綫路，特别在綫圈部分　　（三）板極電池誤接燈絲極　檢察綫路，校正接法。　　（四）蓄電池電壓太高，不適於採用的眞　先量燈絲極電壓，然後用適當的電池空管　　，（購買眞空管時有説明書，可以細細比較）　　（四）聲浪不清晰　　原因　　補救的方法　　（一）聽筒質的不良，或揚聲器構造不佳　購買較佳的收音機揚聲器　　　（二）收间機或揚聲器綫極接错　設法調換接頭　　（三）眞空管電流過多　减少板極電壓，同時能减少燈絲極電壓最佳。　　（四）蓄電池電量用盡　充電或調換　　（五）眞空管質的不佳　更換比較質佳的眞空管　（待續）</p>

<p>自由談藝術與鏡  林林　　把現實的典型具體反映出來，乃是藝術的特質。一個偉大的藝術家，就是能够「揭破了現實的假面」並且「把現實的各種各樣的現象，獨特地普遍化於形象之中，而呈出這些現象的本質，矛盾及發展傾向。」托爾斯泰之被稱爲「俄國革命的鏡」者，就是富有生活經騐的托爾斯泰，能够把他所屬的時代，活生生地反映於他的作品裏面。卽是説，這「俄國革命的鏡」的藝術作品，它把當時（十九世紀中末）俄國的一切的社會現實的矛盾错綜，及一般農村複雜的條件，……充分地反映出來。　　托爾斯泰，在他的「我的創作經騐」一文中，曾説··卽「……藝術是向前走的。它不但要展開過去的生活的鏡頭，而且要展開未來的生活的鏡頭。」在這裏，托氏要藝術家的生活的鏡頭，在現在向着過去展開，又從現在向着未來展開，並且要掀開未來的烟幕，集全力於顯示未來的藝術工作。這個鏡頭，就好像需要是一個「望遠鏡」了。我們在這裏可看出托爾斯泰非常重視藝術的動的發展性的地方。　　再之，羅曼羅蘭曾説道··「藝術家的藝術，是面鏡子，把現實社會如實的反映出來。」這個説明，就是寫實主義的説明。所謂「如實的反映」的意思，不僅是反映現實的眞實性，並且那現實的本質的諸關聯，本質的典型的諸性格丨丨如粗獷豪猛，理論與行動一致起來的「吉訶德」，或是那正相反的「哈孟雷特」丨丨全都能够在形象中反映出來。藝術的鏡，絶不是像那僅照出外型的死板的攝影機，而是也具有像放大非常細微的東西的「顯微鏡」和射照到骨子裏去的「Ｘ光綫」等一樣的作用的。　　但是，藝術的鏡，並不是像懸空的日輪，只是反映出純客觀的現實的羅列的東西。反映現在的藝術的鏡，那鏡頭的展開，角度，方向及其他，是要依着藝術家來選擇和修正的。有的藝術家（卽指退思妥也夫斯基）他是有把自已的經騐，經由了自已意識的三稜鏡而曲折了的特殊作風的。（見盧那卡爾斯基的論退思妥也夫斯基）因此，在這裏產生了藝術家的主觀性來。無論「做爲俄國革命的鏡」的托爾斯泰也罷，或於沙士比亞，巴爾札克等偉大藝術家也罷，全都不能抓着自已的頭髮離開地面去的。藝術家依着生活經騐過程來正確化世界觀，依着正確的世界觀來磨練反映現實的鏡，有了正確的世界觀，正如被偉大之光所照耀一樣，那面鏡，更是格外準確的分明的鏡。　　藝術的鏡。時代的鏡。未完的故事  陳福熙　　天已經晚盡了，一家人坐在昏黄的煤油燈前。季候是暮秋，天氣不是大暖，街道上撒着濃重的夜霧。在這窳陋的，樸實的鄉鎭上，一到黄昏過後，什麽喧擾也没有，整個的鄉鎭躺在静默裏。暮秋的夜正是岑寂的。　　父親爲了件要事，在晚餐後跑到門外去。　　會説話的父親走了，屋子裏便陷在更深的静裏。三個孩子··一個女的，二個男的，年紀最大的只有八九歲。這時候，小肚子統裝得飽飽的，團團的圍坐在母親身旁，不想睡，也不看畫報，只希望一個中年的母親，爲他們講些述美麗的故事。　　「媽！講一個好聽的故事罷。」　　母親正在替最小的孩子縫棉襖。在静默裏，忽然聽到孩子這樣説，於是放下針綫，把慈靄的眼睛望到三個小孩子的臉上。　　「講什麽呢？」母親笑問。　　「隨便，隨便。」　　孩子們最喜聽故事。在飯後，爐邊，或在燈下，年長的父母，往往被求知慾最衝動的孩子所苦緾。他們要聽的是稀奇和神怪·，或者是，帶有一些因果觀念的，敎訓的寓言。滑稽的，富有興趣的，如「呆女婿拜壽」之類，在一般孩子中比較頂喜觀聽。年紀大一些的，便愛聽武俠故事。至於神怪的故事，在晚上，在人少處，孩子們是很怕聽的·，尤其是女孩子，只要故事一開始，她們便投往大人懷裏去，好像披着髮，張着爪牙的水鬼，眞的顯現在眼前一樣。並且她們到晚上睡覺，還做着可怖的惡夢呢。　　但這時，六隻小眼睛都注視着母親，希望母親給他們講一個好聽的，有頭有尾的故事。中年的母親，思索了一會，終於微微的笑起來，説道··　　「那麽，講『吊死鬼告狀』好嗎？…」　　「不要，不要。」搖着小手。　　「我怕聽啦！」又一個説。　　「故事都講完了，再没有好聽的了！你們説再講什麽呢？」　　「講『長毛』罷。」　　「講長毛？」母親的臉上又浮着微笑··「你們知道『長毛』是什麽嗎？」　　「不知道。」　　「長毛眞可怕呢，比鬼更怕！你們外祖母還没有像你們這麽大時，長毛剛剛造反。那時候，天下亂得不成樣，聽你們外祖母説，長毛剃的是和尙頭，包的是紅布，手裏拿的是大刀。他們逢人便殺，看見女人便姦，看見房屋便燒，那時候……」　　「那時候怎麽樣？」　　「那時候，街上都堆着血淋淋的死屍，男的，女的都有。有幾個不願被殺的人，吊死的吊死，投河的投河。聽説那時候，河裏只見死屍，一個，二個，三個，數也數不清·，人的血，把河水柒紅了……」　　「外祖母説，那時候有兩個人家，同住着一間屋子，因爲窮，没有逃難。一天，長毛到了，闖進屋裏來殺人，只殺剩一個小孩子，還有一個投河投在死屍身上而未死的女人。那女人，眞是憐的，恐怕長毛殺她，在死屍身上睏了二天，第一天，她還聽見小孩子在屋裏亂跑亂喊，「媽呀，餓呀，」地呌，第二天晚上，就聽不到呌聲了·，直到第三天一看，天哪！小孩子已經被幾條餓狗吃掉啦！吃賸的只有些烏油油的頭髮，浸在糢糊的血液裏……　　「那時候，有錢的都逃難了·，但逃難，逃到什麽地方去呢？外祖母在那时，一家人躱在一個很大的破墓裏。墓口，用些草和泥遮着。長毛倒不曾注意。他們吃的是……」　　母親的話正講到這裏，預備把外祖母逃難中的情形訴述一遍，但門兒忽然響了。　　「爸回來了，明天再繼續講吧。」　　説着出去開門，於是長毛的故事便在此中止，而成了未完的故事……向後轉  ＴＫ從喬治桑聯想到蕭邦  方企　　在本月九日婦女圖地上勾君底「談喬治桑」一文使我聯想到她和「披霞娜之靈魂」又是愛國音樂家的蕭邦（E.F.Chopin)的一段關係。　　像神童莫查德一樣，蕭邦是一個短命的音樂天才．生平多愁善病，常感慨地説，「我是怎樣羡慕那些體强力壯的人們喲！」可是事實是··要是他賦有强健的體格，恐怕不會開出那樣美麗的音樂之花來了。他底短促的一生丨三十九年彷彿是一闋徐慢的疾病進行曲，無疑的，他底許多最美麗的音樂之花便是在這疾病底暖床上開放出來的。喬治桑説··「當他病篤時，他創造了含有天國風味的音樂。」　　蕭邦生於波蘭，父親是法國人，母親是波蘭人。法蘭西民族底熱情與波蘭民族底亡國哀愁底情愫交流於他底血管裏。流亡，疾病，與被禁錮的愛給予他底音樂以可愛的懷鄉情調，可是他底音樂天才老早就表現出來。差不多在他剛會説話的時候便已能彈奏披霞娜，八歲時即在公衆前演奏，並獲得好評。　　波蘭有了這樣特出的音樂天才，已經覺得榮幸而珍如拱璧了。但是，當然的，這位富有靈感的靑年决不能滿足於其現狀，不久便饗往於鄰國底偉大的音樂都市了。於是在一八三零年十一月一日那天，正當他二十歲的時候，他底老師愛爾斯納和幾位知已朋友爲他開了個歡送會，在席間贈給他一隻滿盛波蘭泥土的銀杯，同時舉杯飮祝道··「願你此去毋忘祖國而以赤誠之心愛之彌堅！」　　他果然未嘗忘懷祖國，而且他對於汉蘭的懷愛幾乎是瘋狂的。他出國未及一年，波京華沙即爲俄人所陷。蕭邦聽到這消息時悲憤欲狂。他説，「我底心暫時的死去了。唔，爲什麽不永遠死去呢！丨或許那時比較可以忍耐些了。算了吧！，算了吧！　我底悲痛有什麽言語可以表示呢？…」没有言語，於是他用不朽的音樂來表示他對於這不幸事件的悲憤··他作感他那有名的「革命的練習曲」亅作品第十Ｃ短調練習曲。無論他在什麽地方作曲或演奏，他底音樂始終貫澈着祖國底靈魂。　　他曾游歷過維也納，慕尼黑，布拉格，德萊斯登等名城，最後到了巴黎，在此消磨其殘餘的十八年之大部分光陰。他在巴黎久居是必然的。維也納嫌太浮躁，德國嫌太嚴肅，惟有在巴黎纔能得到他所希求的安逸。　　在這裏過度他底隱遁的音樂生活若干年以後，他終於和喬治桑發生了戀愛，以至於同居。關於這事的記述已經費却不少筆墨，但是很少翔實可靠的記載，因爲他們底情書已經毁滅，無從考證。一部分人底意見，以爲他倆底結合乃是性格浪漫的喬治桑對於那動人的靑年音樂家進攻而勝利的結果，這好像説蕭邦是她底愛情底俘虜。但是我們根據事理推論，可以斷定那話是不對的。須知蕭邦是一個沈浸於痛苦中的病夫，而喬治桑則是一個慣於活躍的文藝生活的女作家，她能够在他沈疴緾綿的幾個年頭裏仟怨任勞地服侍他，若非抱有絶大的犧牲精神是斷乎辦不到的。無論她開始戀愛的動機如何，她對於蕭邦的愛是有着高貴的情愫的，同時她對於他底天才底發展也有着良好的響影。茂鐸企（Mur　cch）在其近著「蕭邦傳」中承認這一點，他説蕭邦在喬治桑底感化之下「有一種勢力使他底理想更廣大，他度靈感更高貴，他底意念更豐富。」　　他倆底愛的關係持續了十年，當他們仳離時，蕭邦離開他底死期衹有兩年了，他底肺病已無救，雖然他自已也知道，但似乎並不放在心上。他還到過倫敦和蘇格蘭，並且受到不少庸俗的女子底誘惑。不久他終於回到巴黎，不到一年便死了。他底遺體葬於巴黎，但是他底心仍被送回到它所時刻緬懷的祖國去。　　最後，引喬治桑底話以爲結束··「我想他底心身是過於優秀，過於纖巧，過於完美，因而不能在我們這卑劣粗俗的人生中長久地生活下去」。明天（十)(七）  （Joseph　Cornad）著吳向隅譯　　『我深怕，你是一個硬心腸的男人。』她嘆息着説。　　『我從來不取假名字，我從來也不對女人講謊。什麽謊？哎，謊丨丨。接受我。或離開我，我説·，如果你接受我，那末就是……』他靠着牆低低地哼出一個小調。　　『啊，嗬，嗬，河！　　永别了，　　我们漂亮的年靑的女郎，　　我們是開往「格朗德河」。』　　『這是絞盤歌』他解説。她的牙齒打戰了。　　『你是冷酷的，』他説。這兒是我拾起你的一件東西。她覺得他的手靠近她，替她緊密地把包頭圍起來。『抓住兩頭合攏到前面來，』他命令着。』　　『爲什麽？爲了我跑開麽？唔！你要呌我去做一個律師的書記丨只不過爲討他的喜歡。他是自已家裏的主人·，再加我的可憐的母親在旁邊煽動丨也許爲了我的幸福，我揣想。於是，哎亅已經長久以前·，我走開。不，我告訴你··我離開的一天，爲了他的極愛我，我是混身靑腫。啊他永遠是有些像個脚色。現在看一看那一把鍬吧。出於他的發痴麽？不見得全是吧。那才十分像我的爸爸。他要我在這兒只不過要有一個人來聽他差遣。可是我們早已窮極了·，五金鎊對於他有什麽希奇呢丨十六年困苦時間中只不過一次？』　　『呀，但我却替你抱歉。你從不想再回家了麽？』　　『做一個律師的書記，腐爛在這地方丨或和這兒差不多的地方？』他輕蔑地喊出。『呸！如果老頭子今天替我造好了一個家庭，我馬上踼翻給他看丨丨否則，在三天没有完的時間裏，我死給他看。』　　『那末你希望死在什麽地方呢？』　　『在隨便什麽地方的樹林中·，在海中，或者在一個擇定的可詛咒的山峯上。在家裏麽？是的！世界就是我的家·，但我希望有一天死在一家醫院裏。那有什麽道理呢？在这一生中隨便什麽地方都好··我除開一個裁縫或一個兵士以外，我可以做一切你所能想到的事情，我曾做過一個兩國交界地帶的馬賊，我也曾剪過羊毛，我也曾偷過東西背在背上·，我也曾用魚义捉着一條鯨魚。我也曾準備一隻大船，找尋金子，剝過牛皮，丨亅我所化用掉的錢比老頭子一身搜刮起來的還要多。哈哈！』　　他驚嚇了她。她縮做一團，勉强説出『休息的時間到了。』　　他從倚靠的牆上站起來，用很嚴厲的聲音説『去的時間到了。』　　但他却不移動。他又倚到牆上，有所思地哼出一二隻異國情調的小曲。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言空虚銀行  吹　　我看見銀行　便肅然而起敬慕的情緒　因爲裝璜的富麗，規模的偉大，原和我輩窮措大絶不發生任何關係，但就是前去參觀參觀，也有些兒不敢，並不是「黑眼烏珠看見了白銀子」，便要起不良的心，也不是看了幾位銀行職員的「架子面孔」，有些難受，實因自己照照鏡子，看看衣裳，殊覺慙愧，有些不好意思進去。　　上海號稱最多的，便是烟紙店，醫生，律師，窰子，和老虎灶，現在銀行之多，也如雨後春笋，到處可見，我方纔羡慕號稱東方紐約的上海，果眞名不虚傅。但看近日的報紙，除稍微前一些不算外，就卽最近兩日而論，銀行宣告停業的，已有兩家，十二日報載，永安銀公司，因内部改組，宣告停業，據稱停業原因，緣内部空虚，經濟周轉不靈之故，十三日報載，儉德銀行，改組無望，今晨宣告停業。這兩家銀行，二日之間，先後突告停業，其内容的空虚，天然不問可知。　　銀行爲金融最高機關，藉以調劑金融，安定社會的一種組織。故银行的設立，當以股本的實在，進備金的充足。最爲重要。但本埠的银行，資本盈實，準備金寛裕的，固是很多。但内容空虚，毫無準備金，全恃吸收現金，維持塲面，高其利率，以廣招來，此稱银行，諒也不在少數。此種銀行，非但不足以調劑金融，安定市面、反足以擾亂金融，破壞社會，其影響所及，殊非藐小。　　此種銀行，因爲資本的不充實，和信用的不昭著，於是不得不務求表面的堂皇，形式的壯茂，以爲打動人心，吸收現金的工具。是以數十萬元的小銀行，而一切房屋之費、裝璜之費，或去其資本之半以上，如此銀行，空虚可想。</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>據聞前日某银行之倒閉，資本額原不足百萬元、而開設分行計有七八處之多。試問按月房屋的租金若干，和職員的待遇若干，此種開支，日須多少，此種銀行，完全是一種欺騙性質，若不嚴厲禁止，則遺害何堪設想。故取締之法，當分兩種步驟，（一）停止發給開設銀行執照，（二）詳細調查股本之是否確實，準備金之是否充足，以爲取締之標準，否則銀行愈開愈多，倒閉而宣告停業的，亦必愈多。如此局面之下，其影響所及，伊於何底！棉袍  張健　　天一冷，立功又像夏末秋初那時候樣的煩悶起來了。　　昨天同着小王密絲李從辦公處走回來，天是陰暗的，没有陽光，没有一些温度·，風，從每條街口，弄口，特别有勁地吹到人的身上，把立功的夾袍像紙一樣輕的從脚背吹過了小肚，他惱怒的，又羞慚的，時時用手把夾袍的下擺挪下去。　　小王看見了這窘狀，就用譏笑的態度，拉拉密絲李，奸笑着説··「冬天了，立功還穿夾袍，畢竟是硬漢」？　　密絲李在翻到耳邊的皮領里斜過眼來望望斜南着的立功，吃吃地笑了。　　這一笑，立功的臉立刻紅了起來。他怨恨小王不該在密絲李面前那樣的滅自已的威風。於是推托着要到一個朋友家里去，就同他們分手了。　　回到家里，對小王這樣輕視的舉動，立功越想越氣憤了。他想，小王這傢伙眞是太可惡了，他憑了父親有着幾個臭銅子，就整天同密司李胡闹·，可是，他爲什麽當了她的面來羞辱自已呢？太豈有此理！　　過些時，立功的氣衰弱了些，想想自已是憑自已的力量來賺錢是一些没慚愧的，只有依着父親的勢而寄生着的，和那些供給有錢人的兒孫做玩具的女人，他們才是很羞恥的。　　但，旁的盡可不管，天却的確是冷了。走在路上，兩手束在袖口裏，還老是打着塞戰。　　夜來，忽然粒粒拉拉地下起雨來。冬天下雨，不是一天冷如一天嗎？立功眞噪急極啦！　　没有辦法，衹有鑽在被窩裏，好在被窩還熱的，管他媽的明天，睡了一晚再説。　　待了一覺醒來，雨不知在什麽時候已經停了，衹是没有了同往那樣温和的晨光，天黑得像要下雪。　　爬起來，推窗，望望街頭的情景，風唬的一陣把窗撞了回來，在飯桌上落下了幾片離了枝的枯葉，立功懊喪地把窗關上了。　　問題的確逼緊啦丨今天氣候特冷，要是仍把夾袍穿出去，非但會遭到小王的冷笑，自已也將凍得受不了啊！　　是該穿棉袍的時候了。但，自已的棉袍不是在上春當没了嗎？做一件吧！錢呢？工錢，不是早就穿到鄉下去了嗎？　　後悔着不該把工錢寄回鄉去，不然棉袍也有了，也不會受小王的譏笑了。但，他覺得這也不對的，家鄉里有老母，妻子，孩子，他們也急需做棉衣啊！這些問題就盡在立功的腦海裏翻覆着，翻覆着。東窮的少爺自已的兒子地區小品  程銓　　我終於到這兒來生活了亅亅這兒是人類生活中的地下層，是地球以外的另外一個世界，是太陽光永遠達不到的地區。你要我説一點我底近况，那末這對你或許也會發生一點興趣的·，不過聽人説你近來正埋首於晋人小品中間，「山水清談」，多少染上了一點晋公子的優悠的風度，那末對這一點生活的傳奇也許有一點不合味的亅亅生活的傳奇衹就是生活的傳奇，其中絲毫没有什麽風情與哲理之類的東西，有的衹是一種可怕的，原始的，血淋淋的慾望··要吃，要逃去死亡！　　這兒是北方的一個小小的莊子，百來方里的面積，三四十家的人家，如果你到描寫辭典上去找一找，也許找得出像「泥壁茅蓬四五家，山茶初茁兩三芽」那麽美麗的描寫小小的農莊的句子，可是對這兒似乎還不大適用亅亅這兒的没有山茶，土地中雜了多量的沙，人們平常衹種一點荳麥高梁與大麻等作物糊口。大好的年成也衹能平平安安地呌人勉强過一個冬罷啦亅丨那便是説··僱個人來在屋外加塗一層乾草和泥，屋子裏堆得一點樹枝柴與雜糧，家裏人有一件土布冬衣窗而已。風氣又是那麽閉塞的，在上海流行着一九三四的巴黎新裝的年頭</p>

<p>，這兒還找得到十五六歲的裹了脚的姑娘··梳着髮結，穿了耳朶。把男子看得像皇帝一樣，低着頭，寗可在暗中落眼淚，從不敢説一個「不」字的。　　如果你一定要給它鍍一鍍金，那末你也能找上一些描寫中世紀的情調的語句來描寫這古舊的地區，可是我實在不能那麽做亅亅譬如在這個荒災的年頭，人們把兒女一個個吊死在樹上的當兒，我能用什麽語句來形容它呢？　　這年頭眞是太古怪啦··南方旱得土地起了裂，這兒却發了大水亅亅大水漂來的時候，已經是深秋的天氣啦，人們蹲在屋頂上，裸着上身，眼睁睁的看天，整天整夜的那麽蹲着，熱湯也喝不到一口，没幾天，老的小的就死了一小半。死了的，人們就把來丢在水裏。　　没十天，水退了的時候，就衹剩年輕的人啦，人們埋了給水浸爛了的家人的屍體，跟着便找草根，嫩樹枝與觀音土，死命望肚子裏塞。　　這兒也許有一兩家過得去的「大户」，爺們特别照應窮人，揀上眼些的姑娘們呌進去，十個餑餑，就把女孩兒家的身體丢啦，爺們當然是怪樂意的，就是拿到餑餑的人還是千多萬謝的呢。男子漢想跑外路，可是没有力量，有幾個拚着死挺出去的，結果還是挺着回來了，「死也要死在家鄉呢，」便那麽地完了。　　譬如有外路來的「收貨的」（註：販賣人口的）、便趁火打刦，五塊十塊的把上眼的娘兒們收了去，給她們穿上好看的衣裳，帶到上海，帶到漢口、帶到東三省，要她們在夜的街角裏笑，笑，笑……　　就那麽的，人們生活着，人們死亡着·，這兒永遠没有太陽·，不是嗎，像這種血淋淋的地區，就連太陽都不敢到的。車上  周漢　　我多謝你没有到車站送行，假如你不出我所料地竟那麽大清早還跑到車站送行的話，我是以爲給我更加没有興趣。雖然你是出我意料之外地並不跑來送行使我不樂。　　你莫笑我，我是不願你到車站送行，又希望你來送行的啊。　　還好，你那天，並没有如約地到月台上看我走，否則、你要多心，不樂，我也難免發生許多麻煩。我告訴你，丨我那天有一個很講究「禮貌的大學敎授陪着我上車，陪着我一起走的啊。　　你且不要急，我告訴你嗄。那位大學敎授，眞有趣。他擠進賣票處，流了一身大汗，替我買車票，險些兒將他的近視眼鏡擠掉，我遠遠地看見擠脱離了他的鼻梁，落在另外一個男人的身上，他馬上成了瞎子，用手在那人的身上亂摸，一邊兒高喊着··「我的眼鏡？我的眼鏡？」使我不禁哈哈地笑出聲來。　　在車上，他簡直是成了我的僕人，只要我説，「天氣眞熱，」他的茶就馬上倒了一杯捧給我，温柔地微笑着勸我喝茶解渴，説是，喝喝茶也就不熱了。車到某一小站，有人在車外呌賣東西，我不懂那是在呌賣什麽，只是問了他一下。他唯恐我不買亅不是，唯恐我不吃那東西似地亅馬上就拿錢出來呌買。等到我看見所買的東西，是菱角，並不想吃的時候，他問我呵要吃，我説，這東西並不好吃，他也附和着説，眞是髒東西，不好吃，馬上將拕丢到車外去了。　　在中午的時候，車上的僕歐在呌賣着東西，我還没想要吃，他馬上問我阿要吃大菜？蛋炒飯？我覺得好笑，又不便笑出口，只得回過頭去望車外在飛動着的電綫桿，他却以爲我不高興了。又忙柔聲下氣地勸我··「到午飯的時候應該吃點，車到南京已經是午後兩三點鐘了呢。」我不好意思拒絶他的誠意，簡單地告訴他，説我只要一客土司好了，他馬上連聲高喊着車上的僕歐，來兩客土司。　　我不願意吃人家的東西，你是知道的，當我吃了土司要會賑的時候，他的錢送到僕歐的手裏比我更快。我自然不肯吃他的東西，我偏要自已會賑，他難過得幾乎要流下眼淚來似地勸我給他會賑。他説，Gentleman合lady一起吃飯的時候，由Gentleman會賑，那是講究禮貎的事。在Gentleman是有禮貎·，在Jady也是有禮貎。我説我不相相那些禮貎，硬要會賑··我可憐兮兮地哀求着我説、這次由他給，下次由我給好了。在僕歐，在車裏的人，他們都在注意我同他的争執亅他們自然以爲我同他是熟人，説不定還以爲我是他的什麽人，這樣一來，我如果太過固執，自然是給他太過不去，會傷了他Gentleman的心，於是乎我讓步了。你莫急，我告訴你嗄。當這争執的風波以後，我和平地但又嚴肅地對他説，「現在我給你的面子」，下車以後，我將飯錢還你，你不收就對不起我了。」他連忙地答應，並且，稱讚我是高貴的Lady,他説他對我十分敬佩。　　車到了南京下關車站，我將飯錢如數的送還他，他收起了。而且明白我不是可以用「禮貎」誘惑下去的女人，他也並不迫我，連替呌我馬車都不，而説聲Good　bye地走了。你想，我這旅行多有趣啊！　　消息　本埠南京路德裕里圖畫書局，特聘李輝英，朱菉園兩君刊行「生生」月刊，第一期執筆者，聞有魯迅·茅盾郁達夫·杜衡·葉紫·征農·蘆焚·枊湜·佛郎·杜輝義·賀宜·黑嬰·莊啟東·汪馥泉·王任叔·沈聖時諸人之作品，定於明年新正一日出版，定價兩角，每篇小説中均附有精美插圖數幅，版本爲十六開式，厚報紙印，約八十餘頁，該認取材新穎，編排美觀，諒能獲得廣大之贊美云。歸途  胡慰雄　　坐了半天火車半天船，終於踏上故鄉的碼頭了。那時候已經晚鴉歸巢，炊烟四起，我一手提了旅行箱，一手携了一盞買來的紙燈籠，因爲還要趕十多里的小路才到家。　　這夜没有月亮，没有星星，跑了一段路，已絶黑了。點了燈，燈光僅照見面前半尺路遠。這雖是一條熟路，從前半夜裏趕路時就不帶燈的，現在可覺得走陌生路一樣。更因爲旅途上的疲乏，兩手提着物件趕路，時時幾乎踣跌下去。　　十來里路在我們莊稼人走走是不在乎的，如果有兩個人搭伴，彷彿走着玩似的一霎兒就到了。今天却像這小路加倍長了，身上已微微感到汗意，没奈何在田角牛車棚裏休息一陣，放下提箱，把紙燈籠吊在棚角上，吹了二陣凉風，從衣袋中掏出烟捲來，索性倒在棚架，闔着眼睛抽烟，這時候眞可以説得心心曠神怡，我忘了接　　　時的　病急·，忘了旅途上所受的困難情形，抽了一枝烟，又勇氣勃勃的趕路了。　　大約離家一二里路，遠遠的望見那裏閃着燈光，但是鄉下的小路是那樣曲折的，那燈光時而被房屋·，樹頭遮過了。我愈想快走，那燈光愈像遠遠的，我腦海就回憶起祖父過世時的情形。　　那天也在夜半了，祖父咽了最後一口氣，合家異常慌亂，一切身後都要到市鎭上去購買，我，父親，叔叔就連夜趕到鎭上，回來的時候，望見家門口的燈光亂幌，酸淚不由地奪眶而出……　　現在又望見這同樣的燈光了，我是被父親病重的信催歸的，怎不令人想起同樣的事呢？　　不顧一切的向前奔，一個鞋子也脱去了，將近到那燈光的地方，被一個粗大的聲音喝住。我定眼看時，原來在我家田角上搭了一所派出所，一個穿黑衣的警察握着槍攔住我的去路，我舉起頭�望見那盞吊在門前幌動的燈，幾乎哭了出來。我由他檢查了我的手提箱，檢查了我的身上，他就大聲大氣地問我·，「爲什麽半夜裏這樣飛奔？」　　我聴見他的沙嗓子，忙注視他的面部，原來是我家從前的長工福生．我還恐錯認了人，操了鄉音告訴我從上海回來探望爸爸的病的。　　「小少爺，大家不認識了。」　　福生還是那個粗手粗脚的樣子拍拍我的肩頭、拉我到派出所裏，送了一杯茶，他告訴我爸的病轉機了，前二天眞是可怕，已經不能進食了，才寫快信要我歸來的。前天從鎭上請來一位大夫，現在還住在我家，吃了他幾服藥，已經能够談話了·，他又説他每天去探望老爺的。　　我因爲快跑了一陣路，聽見爸的病已轉機，就寛坐了一回。　　「這個派出所怎麽成立的？」我們閑談了起來。　　「啊，小少爺不知道，近來鄉下時常强盜搶呢！那些强盜都有傢伙的，宋家老爺，朱家老爺都嚇得搬到鎭上去了。我們老爺説鎭上也不見安静，不過有了警察局可以稍微好一點，在出來的時候，老爺就要求局長這裏設個派出所，我是被派到這裏來的。」　　出來，他帮我提了箱子燈籠到家門口，家裏人已等候我半天了。銹軋剪  陳亮　　張寳記理髮店，旋轉着紅白藍亅三色玻璃柱，門面窗格上段開着個碗口那麽大的圓洞，是預備到冬天裝置火爐烟囱的，午後的陽光便打那圓洞口水似的瀉了進去，那樣和暖得如春波，温泉呢。　　温泉便澆在坐在第三座轉椅上的小榮生的頭上，流下來，流遍了左腮，左肩，又往鍍克羅蜜的擱手上流，泛着白色烈光。午後的理髮店是空閒的，正和夏午的田野一樣。小榮生本在那兒打着磕睡，剛被小學徒洗毛巾的放水聲驚覺了。「小鬼，勤儉死啦！」懊喪也咕噥着。掉過脖子，睁開眼來便有了歡感，悄悄地「多麽好的太陽呵，這麽在心兒裏説着。　　手掌代了毛巾，儘在臉上抺着，一些寂寞，一些無聊，攪混在他情緒裏。伸過懶腰的胳膞反牽在頸項後面，覺得頸項亦不是安置胳膞的地方。懶懶地放了下來，又懶懶地去摸大鏡下面的抽屜銅拉手，他却並没有拉開那抽屜的意思，他知道裏面除掉一把銹軋剪外，並没有别的東西。然而，他終於把抽屜拉開了。銹軋剪依舊静悄悄地跟一些破紙屑躺在裏面，它被自已遺棄了兩年啦。有時，他發現那軋剪上的銹斑就是他自已的血痕，生命的血痕呵。是的，他記得有那麽一個日子，自已腦杓上的血濺到這把軋剪上，鮮紅的，鮮紅的，現在還耀在他眼兒裏似的，可是亅　　　　兩年以前的事啦。　　一個初冬的傍晚吧，記得很清楚，自已正打外面幹了露天活兒回來，師父一股怒眼兒瞟着我，没一天不給挨駡，今天更厲害，原因是回來得晏了，虚心地把高脚凳和臉盆架兒從酸麻的手腕裏放下。　　「做到幾個錢！」師父邊在磨剃刀，邊問我，大聲大氣的。　　便顫抖地打開洋鉛皮傢伙盒兒，從銹軋剪，鈍剃刀，木梳，篦箕裏面把銅子理出、數一數，二百四十三個，就交給師父，師父可理也没理，磨他的剃刀。自已就去帮着同夥兒拉風箱，理髮店裏的學徒够苦的，外面做，家裏做，挨打挨駡是算不了什麽的。做露天活兒更苦，夏天晒太陽，冬天括風，給街警揍，給流氓欺，東街闖到西街，没家没道的，想想得淌眼淚，眼淚。風箱兒正拉的上勁哪，兀的腦杓上着了重重的一記。就是那把銹軋剪。就是師父，把我腦杓亂揍··「小鬼，這麽成天的在外面貪懶，做這麽一些錢！」　　血打腦杓上淌下來，淌在破柳條褲兒上，手一抺，紅的，心一陣酸，哭啦、可不敢哭出聲來。仍得扔住傷口拉風箱。第二天出去，銹軋剪上滿染着紫色的血漬，想想，呵亅眼淚，苦……　　可是，現在滿了師，兩年啦。小榮生在無意中又見到了他的有着生活創痕的銹軋剪，他在這一刹的追憶中，回味了生命的苦味。　　，和暖　和春波的午後的陽光澆在他身上，但，在他衹感覺到熱辣辣地刺痛。無綫電播音節目特别節目　　靑一口琴隊　　安定（八六０）下午二時至三時　　小夜曲（劉逸）卜郎琪將軍進行曲（王恂伯）錦標勝手（馬錦文）自由射手（沈廷華）多諾河之波（陳志高）與生軍進行曲（李厚襄）簡短前律　二重奏　（王啟鈞　秦泰來）　愛麗仙之女（劉仲光）快樂銅匠（張承沛）皇后（劉逸）美國巡邏兵（丁明）浮士德圓舞曲二重奏（李厚襄　劉逸）歌唱　　上海無綫劇社　　永生（一０八０）下午四時半至五時半　　小小茉莉（曼娜）慈母搖籃曲（露茜）飛花村之歌（倉隱秋）舟中曲（曼娜）小寶貝（露茜）丁香山（倉隱秋）漂泊者（哈鈞亮）　　華東（一三六０）下午八時至九時　　鴛鴦怨（曼娜）妹妹我怪你（露茜）回憶（新華社嚴斐）我的愛人就是你（倉隠秋）萬里尋兄詞（曼娜）航空救國（露茜）花想容（新華社嚴斐）小鷄小鴨（倉隱秋）　　新華社　　敦本（八００）下午五時至六時　　夜月之歌（周璇）安眠（嚴華）永别了弟弟（葉英）薄命佳人（徐健）鳳陽花鼓（周璇）歸程（嚴華）擱樓上的小姐（徐健）求愛秘訣（葉英）　　大中華（一一六０）　　下午六時一刻至七時十分　　楊柳絲絲（周璇）風雨歸舟（嚴華）銀色的凄凉（徐健）人面桃花（葉英）花生米（周璇）大路歌（嚴華）民族之光（全體）小小茉莉（葉英）　　芙蓉團　　市音（一三四０）下午五時至六時　　　　　（　　）慈母　　　（雪雪）安眠　韻）王女士的鷄（雪雪）女軍人歌（雪芬）　　安定（八六０）下午七時至八時　　小小畫眉鳥（雪雪）阿憐的秋香（雪芬）漁光曲（文壁）愛的徬徨（黄韻）甜蜜的睡（黄韻）圈兒信（雪雪）　　華興（一二六０）下午八時一刻至九時　　蝴蝶姑娘（黄韻雪雪）吹泡泡（雪芬）逍遙曲（黄韻）努力（黄韻）徴求女友（雪雪）　　大中華（一一六０）下午九時至十時　　小小茉莉（黄韻）月下花前（雪雪）城市之光（黄韻）心琴曲（雪雪）夜來香（雪芬）别矣巴黎（文璧）　　中西（一０四０）下午十時一刻至十一時　　西宮詞（黄韻）蘇三不要哭（黄韻）光明之路（包雪雪）民族之光（雪雪黄韻）船夫曲（徐文璧）大軍進行曲

<h3>Discussion of the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the fifth congress in the afternoon on the 14th, the Fifth Plenary Session discussed the Draft Constitution. Due to time constraints, it was impossible to review it article by article, so a general discussion was held. Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhaoming, Jiao Yitang, Zhu Peide, Zhang Zhiben, and others spoke in succession, stating that the Legislative Yuan had spent more than a year carefully deliberating and drafting the Constitution, and they were generally satisfied. They believed that all the shortcomings and defects of previous drafts of the Constitution since the Republic had been prevented and remedied this time. However, in today's era, with our country's environment as it is, and the world's trends as they are, how can our country create a strong nation? The Constitution, which is a century-long plan, should be infused with a full spirit. However, in this draft Constitution, they felt that this point was still lacking and should be supplemented. All the attending committee members unanimously agreed and resolved to submit it to the Standing Committee for careful review based on the established principles. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense and solemn when the case was discussed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Plenary Session Commends the Bandit Suppression Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fifth Plenary Session's message of commendation to the bandit suppression soldiers: Nanjing Chairman Chiang and all bandit suppression soldiers: The spread of the Red Bandits has lasted for several years. You have been responsible for the overall situation, supervising the soldiers in Huaibei, and all the soldiers have been dispatched and sacrificed heroically. Recently, the bandit lair has been conquered, and Jiangxi and Fujian have been cleared. The Congress has heard the good news and is deeply gratified. In addition to the fact that generous compensation and proper resettlement for the wounded, deceased, and disabled soldiers has already been resolved as a special case and handed over to the responsible authorities for prompt execution, this telegram is sent to comfort our loyal and brave soldiers. We still hope that you will continue your efforts to eliminate the remaining bandits in the shortest possible time, so that the people of the whole country can live in peace. Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Plenary Session passed the declaration of the Congress in the afternoon on the 14th. The full text is as follows: The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang convened in the capital on December 10, 1934, exactly one year since the Fourth Plenary Session. In this year, the national crisis remains, and foreign aggression has not ceased. The members of our Party, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people, are mindful of the danger and hold ourselves in awe, diligently and without懈怠. We deeply know that to resist foreign aggression, we must first secure the interior, and to avenge humiliation, we must first strengthen ourselves. The work of saving the nation and seeking survival should prioritize enriching national strength and reforming politics, and all facilities should be based on this principle. For example, increasing the construction of highways and railways to facilitate transportation, restoring water conservancy and agriculture to enrich production, reforming the administrative system to increase efficiency, and abolishing exorbitant taxes to relieve the people's suffering, rely on the joint efforts of the government and the people. Compared to a year ago, there are still visible achievements. What is especially gratifying to our people is that the Red Bandits have occupied Jiangxi and Fujian for several years, relying on dangerous terrain, establishing pseudo-governments, gathering fugitives, and wantonly carrying out destruction. Not only do the local people suffer from deep pain, but it is also a major problem for the heart and abdomen of the nation. Recently, all the bandit soldiers bravely fought and died for the country, and finally recovered the long-occupied bandit areas one by one, and the bandit lair, known as a natural danger, was fundamentally destroyed. Looking back on the past year, we are even more convinced that the development of national consciousness can overcome any difficult environment. However, the coming days are difficult. Although the bandit areas of Jiangxi and Fujian have been recovered, they are full of devastation. The post-war work of comforting and gathering the people is even more arduous. Although the bandit lair has been destroyed, the remaining bandits broke through and fled west, attempting to disturb Sichuan and Guizhou. It still awaits the continued efforts of the bandit suppression soldiers to fundamentally eliminate them and eliminate the root of the disaster forever. All construction to enrich national strength has gradually taken shape, but it is far behind the powers. In addition, in recent years, affected by the world economic recession, the rural areas have become increasingly desolate. This year, unfortunately, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River basin have suffered from floods and droughts, and the people in the disaster areas have been displaced. How to comfort and relieve them is especially our inescapable responsibility. Moreover, today's international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Our country, with its remaining weakness, is in the forefront of the impact. Once the crisis breaks out, it will lead to destruction. The country's progress is difficult, and there is nothing more difficult than today. The members of our Party should be even more vigilant and more self-motivated, seeking a way for national survival in times of danger and hardship, so as not to fail the entrustment of the people. Saving the nation and seeking survival depends on enriching national strength, and to enrich national strength, we must first seek genuine national unity and peace. The central and local governments must thoroughly establish a foundation of mutual trust and common trust, supporting each other with sincerity, and following the correct path of politics together is the only way to achieve peace and unity. The Conference paid special attention to this, determined the principle, and handed it over to the Central Political Conference to formulate a plan and implement it effectively. Since the Fourth National Congress, the resolutions of the Central Executive Committee plenary sessions regarding saving the nation and seeking survival have either been constrained by the environment and not yet implemented, or have been implemented but have not achieved full effectiveness. In the future, we should also try our best to implement them, only acting according to our ability, so as not to fail the expectations of all Party members and the compatriots of the whole country. Difficulties build the nation, as the ancient saying goes. The historical facts of the revival of various nations in the world from decline are even more encouraging to our perseverance. Although our country's national strength is dangerous today and the national crisis is heavy, if the central and local governments and the people all hold great determination and make the greatest efforts to move towards the goal of saving the nation, seeking survival, and peaceful unification, then the great cause of national rejuvenation will surely be completed due to our courage and self-confidence. We only hope that our comrades and compatriots will encourage each other. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Two Proposals</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth Congress of the Fifth Plenary Session passed the proposal put forward by Chairman Chiang to effectively reorganize the army and ensure the treatment of officers and soldiers. The original text is as follows: Since the Party's revolutionary Northern Expedition, armed comrades have been the pioneers in promoting revolutionary forces and consolidating the revolutionary foundation. They have sacrificed and struggled for years, not hesitating to endure hardships, which is due to being influenced by the late Father of the Nation's great doctrine and fulfilling their duties to the country. The Central Government's awards, condolences, and commendations to the dead and wounded, and the concern for the lives of ordinary officers and soldiers, have been enough to inspire the loyalty of all soldiers and encourage them to serve on the battlefield. However, in order to respond to the trend of world progress and build China into a modern country, the national army must be actively reorganized as a whole. To make the reorganization of the army achieve real results, it is necessary to improve the morale of officers and soldiers, stabilize the minds of officers and soldiers, so that everyone feels that there is a definite future and knows what to strive for. All soldiers serving the country should be given adequate security. The bandit suppression troops who have been fighting hard for years have endured hardships beyond the ordinary and should be given preferential treatment. I believe that the current national task is to actively reorganize the army to improve its effectiveness, and when reorganizing, there must be practical steps and measures to ensure the soldiers who have served the country for many years. Those in the team must have their treatment confirmed, and those who are not in the team should also have the opportunity to improve their ability and contribute. Therefore, I propose that the Central Government decide to consult the government and carefully plan measures to protect the lives of officers and soldiers, and especially give encouragement and protection to the officers and soldiers of the bandit suppression troops who participated in the bandit suppression in 1934. On the one hand, we should order the government to reorganize the troops as soon as possible, so that all officers and soldiers will feel the Central Government's sincere expectations and love, and will be able to cherish themselves and strive for progress in order to repay the country. The practical effect of the army's reorganization can also be expected to be perfect. If the Congress adopts and passes it, the detailed measures will be drawn up by the competent authorities. Is it appropriate? We respectfully await the public decision. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth Congress of the Fifth Plenary Session passed the proposal put forward by Chairman Chiang regarding compensation for wounded and deceased officers and soldiers and planning for the resettlement of the disabled. The original text is as follows: For the past two years, maintaining order and defending the country has depended on the officers and soldiers on the front lines who have struggled hard, traveled and fought, or died on the battlefield, or were injured and disabled. All long-term battles have resulted in heroic sacrifices. In recent bandit suppression campaigns, which have lasted for several years, the officers and soldiers have fought to the death, disregarding their own safety, and the casualties have been greater than usual. The generals and soldiers have joined the army, adhered to the late Father of the Nation's principles, and achieved benevolence. They have no regrets. From the country's perspective, there should be practical comfort for these loyal and brave soldiers, so that the descendants of the martyrs can rely on them without worry, and the disabled can also have a place to live. According to the regulations of the army's rewards and compensation, the state originally had rules, but due to the country's many difficulties, it was unable to implement them on a large scale and universally. However, the Central Government's reward for loyalty and bravery has been increasing. On the day of the elimination of the Jiangxi bandits, in order to encourage the military and encourage the future, it is proposed that the Central Committee decide to consult the National Government and instruct it to investigate, promptly and generously provide compensation for the wounded and deceased soldiers. For the existing disabled soldiers, please also instruct the responsible authorities to promptly set up accommodation and training institutions, so that they can learn a skill and each can get what they want. I, as the commander-in-chief, share the hardships and joys with them, and every time I think of the sacrifices of the officers and soldiers, I feel that my responsibility has not been fulfilled. I respectfully submit this proposal and await the public decision. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Press Recommendations Submitted to the Central Standing Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gray telegrams from Tianjin Daily, Dagongbao, Beiping Morning Post, etc., to the Plenary Session: (1) Even if news censorship cannot be abolished, it should be strictly implemented in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Central Government. (2) For the punishment of news organizations or news practitioners, even if there are remarks that are out of control, please sanction them in accordance with the Publication Law and the ordinary Criminal Law, without resorting to extraordinary means. (3) All news organizations or news practitioners who have previously been subjected to closure, detention, or other punishments, whether in the central or local governments, should be reopened, unless they have a background of force or riots. Documents and telegrams from the Shanghai Daily Association and the Journalists Association to the Plenary Session: (1) Before the news censorship system is abolished, it is proposed to order all news censorship offices in various places to strictly comply with the censorship standards set by the Central Government, handle them carefully, and avoid being harsh, so as to avoid disputes. (2) News organizations that have been punished in the past, but are not based on force or riots, should be leniently reopened to observe their subsequent effects. The Presidium decided to hand it over to the Standing Committee. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>President of the Legislative Yuan Resigns and is Retained</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Plenary Session received a report from Sun Ke stating that his term of office had expired and he should be allowed to resign from his position as President of the Legislative Yuan. When the Presidium met on the afternoon of the 13th, it was decided that Sun Ke should continue to be responsible for the position of President of the Legislative Yuan, and that his request for resignation should not be discussed. In addition to retaining Sun, the Presidium also presented a report at the fourth meeting on the morning of the 14th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Bo Zhang, etc., Narrate the Disaster Situation in Anhui and Hubei</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Bo Wenwei submitted a request to the Fifth Plenary Session for relief for winter and spring relief in Anhui. When the Fourth Congress discussed it on the 14th, Bo first spoke, describing the disaster situation in Anhui Province. Zhang Qun also stated the flood and drought disaster situation in Hubei Province. Zhang Xueliang added a description of the disaster in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. Many other committee members also spoke, stating that the disaster situation in the provinces this year was severe and unprecedented. Although the government has made efforts to provide relief, such as abolishing exorbitant taxes to relieve the people's suffering, and allocating tobacco, alcohol, license tax, and stamp tax to local governments to make up for the financial losses of local governments, it is still not enough. It should coordinate relief and then decided to submit it to the Ministry of Finance for overall handling (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Examination of Work Report Opinions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the fifth plenary session of the Fifth Central Committee of the Kuomintang, held on the afternoon of the 14th, the examination reports of the Party Affairs and Political Groups regarding the various central committees were adopted. The original text is as follows: After examining the work reports of the Standing Committee and the Organization, Propaganda, People's Movement, Overseas, and various other committees, as well as the work report of the Political Council, it is deeply felt that the work of the Standing Committee in the past year has been able to proceed in accordance with the program of national salvation and survival revealed in the declaration of the previous plenary session, focusing on concentrating national strength and enriching national power. In the military aspect of suppressing bandits, it has been able to command decisively, clear out bandit lairs, and can be regarded as a special and great achievement of the past year. The loyal and courageous advances of the anti-bandit soldiers are commendable and should be rewarded. In the political aspect, the gradual abolition of various exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in various provinces, as well as the consolidation of finances, the construction of transportation, and the reform of education, have all achieved considerable results. The various policies and harvests in stabilizing the foundation of the country and cultivating the people's livelihood are all sufficient to be a symbol of striving for progress. Furthermore, the Fifth National Congress of the Party is about to be held, and the time is when the military campaign against the bandits is about to achieve success. Central Committee members and representatives of the military and Party departments at the front are unable to leave their posts. The Standing Committee, considering the situation, decided to extend the meeting period at the request of all parties. This measure is very appropriate and should be ratified. The work of the Organization, Propaganda, People's Movement, and Overseas committees has also been able to follow the main points indicated by the previous plenary session and strive for progress. In terms of organization, the strength is more concentrated than before, and the implementation of training work is also more pertinent. In terms of propaganda, the expansion and improvement of the film and news industries have both achieved results. In terms of the people's movement, the planning and implementation of work are more practical than before, and effective actions have gradually been taken for the people's organizations. In terms of overseas party affairs, the planning and guidance have also shown effort. The work of various committees has generally achieved results, but it is found that the promotion of party affairs in various places is still uneven, and there is often a lack of mutual balance, support, and joint progress with local politics, which makes it difficult for actual work to achieve consistent results. This is truly regrettable. Therefore, what is hoped for from the Standing Committee to supervise the various committees to pay close attention to and work hard on are the following points: In the future, the various central committees should have close contact in their work, and ensure that various plans and implementations can communicate, echo, and be consistent with each other, so as to achieve the effect of unified command. This is the first point. Establish the center and implementation methods of party affairs work in the future, so that party headquarters in various places can concentrate their forces and progress simultaneously. This is the second point. Substantially improve the relationship between the Party and the government, and formulate specific plans so that local party headquarters and the government can cooperate in the spirit of cooperation and jointly seek the development of construction undertakings. This is the third point. In the political aspect, whenever there is an innovation plan, a propaganda plan that echoes the plan should be formulated and issued to lower-level party headquarters to guide party members to carry out propaganda separately, arousing the public's desire for the new plan to facilitate its implementation. This is the fourth point. Allow comrades to participate in educational administration in order to obtain horizontal links between the Party and education, and at the same time allow educational administrators to receive more of the central education policy in order to obtain vertical links. This is the fifth point. Training work should focus on cultivating abilities. The responsible comrades of provincial and municipal party headquarters must increase their practical administrative abilities. The responsible comrades of county and municipal party headquarters must increase their abilities to engage in educational administration and social undertakings, so that the Party's doctrine can be achieved from propaganda to practice. As for each party member, they should be given the enlightenment of the bright future of the nation, so that they can expand their organizational capabilities with this awareness and direction, and at the same time engage in various movements, leading the people to the path of cultural and national revival, to invigorate the national spirit, so that the people can automatically work for the doctrine and jointly complete the revolutionary cause. This is the sixth point. Use a serving outlook on life to encourage party members. Not only should comrades尽互助尽互济之道, but they must also correct the thinking of young people with the Party's consciousness at all times and places, lead the people to engage in activities that are beneficial to their physical and mental health, and strive to provide relief and assistance to the people in times of crisis, in order to gain the sympathy and faith of society. This is the seventh point. In addition, party affairs in the border areas should also be promoted gradually, depending on the situation, in order to assist in the facilities of border area politics. This is the eighth point. The above is the direction of party affairs to strive for in the future, summarized as a resolution in principle. It is deeply hoped that the Standing Committee will promote the continued advancement of party affairs and politics in accordance with the established direction, so as to complete the entire work of political tutelage. It is especially hoped that the Political Council will continue to work hard, respond to the difficulties of the times, and guide national politics, so as to make significant progress. With regard to enriching national strength, revitalizing rural areas, supporting the national economy, developing industrial infrastructure, promoting national education, rectifying national officialdom, and other important policies, it can promote them more effectively, so as to enrich the foundation of national construction, which is also an important plan for alleviating the people's livelihood and supporting civil rights. The above is the result of the review meeting. Are there any improprieties? Please decide publicly. Conveners: Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Faqin, Qin Zhen.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>On Mr. Guang Li Fusun's Emphasis on Agriculture</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Fusun, a leading figure in the financial world, has returned from overseas study. He published an article entitled "The International Situation and China's Way Out". The gist of his argument is that our country should concentrate its efforts and use the most economical and rigorous methods to ensure that the main agricultural products are sufficient for domestic supply and can also be exported to reduce imports. If this is the case, the most serious trade deficit problem and financial problem in the national economy can be easily solved. As for industry, in addition to vigorously supporting and encouraging existing factories, those with larger capital that are still in the planning stage should establish appropriate procedures to welcome foreign capital cooperation. Mr. Li's argument for attracting foreign investment is not within the scope of this article and can be left aside. As for Mr. Li's emphasis on agriculture, we believe that revitalizing rural areas and increasing production is an urgent task that cannot be doubted. Now, what I want to discuss with Mr. Li and our readers is how to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>We believe that the first priority should be to seek the stability of rural order. Only when the locality is stable can farmers live, gather, cultivate, and engage in production. Taking the country as a whole, since the suppression of the Red bandits, the rural order has been generally more peaceful than before. However, there are occasional cases where young and strong people, affected by drought, take risks and disturb neighboring villages. This can be easily alleviated by government and charitable organizations' disaster relief and the maintenance of local police forces. There are also cases where local tyrants and evil gentry control local politics and exploit farmers, causing farmers to be forced into restless movements. This invisible disruption of order is actually more serious than bandits and requires the most severe handling by the government. Only when corrupt officials and corrupt officials are gone and evil forces are eliminated can farmers live and work in peace.</p>
<p>The second is the adjustment of rural finance. Before planting, farmers need money to buy seeds. After cultivating, they need money to buy fertilizers. At harvest time, they need money to hire temporary helpers. After harvesting, they need money for transportation and storage. All that is needed is either pawned at pawnshops, borrowed from individuals, or pledged to grain shops. In general, the interest rates are extremely high and the conditions are harsh. Creditors may even take advantage of the situation to rob and oppress them through debt in order to achieve the purpose of buying agricultural products at low prices. As a result, farmers work hard all year round and end up being beasts of burden for creditors, gaining nothing themselves. This is the biggest cause of the collapse of rural areas in our country and is what the government and society are most concerned about today. As for those who have the strength and can solve it, in addition to the government, there are only financial circles. In the past, most financiers regarded cities as the only place for investment, and real estate public bonds were their investment targets. As for lending to farmers, they thought it was trivial and unreliable, and few paid attention to it. Little did they know that in recent years, rural credit cooperatives of organizations such as the China Hua Yang Yi Zhen Association, agricultural revitalization loans from the National Government Relief Water Disaster Committee, direct individual loans to farmers from the Lishui Farmers Lending Office, and farmer warehouse pledges from the Ning County Farmers Relief Association have all achieved good results. Farmers pay back principal and interest on time, and there are few arrears. The credibility of farmers should be recognized by us. If the loan is directly lent to individuals, the investment risk may be greater. However, if all farmers in the country have cooperative organizations, and the entire members of the cooperative guarantee the loan of a member, then investment in rural areas must be the most secure. However, the organization of farmer cooperatives cannot be effective by the government's order alone, nor can local officials handle it. It must be guided and organized by financiers. If the financial community can mobilize as a whole, it will show farmers great faith, saying, "I can lend you the money you need," and tell them, "You need to organize cooperatives like this and that," then in a short time, cooperatives can become a common organization for farmers, and rural loans will become the most secure investment target. As a result, cash can be distributed throughout the country and will no longer be congested in cities, and farmers will receive economic assistance and will not find it difficult to increase production and raise their living standards. As Mr. Li said, "The most serious trade deficit problem and financial problem in the national economy can be easily solved."</p>
<p>The third is the convenience of transportation and transportation. Mr. Li once said in his article, "Transportation undertakings must seek their development. Otherwise, even if production increases, it will be in vain if there is no balance." In terms of national food, the balance of surplus and deficit depends first on the convenience of transportation in various places. Unfortunately, if transportation is blocked, the products that farmers have worked hard to obtain cannot be sold outside, and how can they maintain their livelihoods and repay debts? If the farmers in a township are like this, then the township is in danger. If the rural areas of the whole country are like this, then the whole country is in danger. This year's drought has caused suffering, and several affected counties and townships have no harvest. Even those with harvests of more than 70% are all losing money because of the extremely low grain prices. Taking Jiangsu as an example, the grain price in several counties and townships is only more than 3 yuan per load, while the rice price in Shanghai is often around 13 yuan per load. Foreign rice and foreign wheat are pouring in. In the same province, the imbalance of surplus and deficit is like this. This is caused by inconvenient transportation and high freight rates. Therefore, what should be worked hard on at the same time as increasing production is transportation. In terms of transportation methods, the waterway is the cheapest, the railway is more expensive, and the car road is the most expensive. In recent years, the construction of highways in various provinces has achieved amazing results. The development of railways is also being actively promoted. These are all manifestations of our people's emphasis on transportation construction, which is deeply encouraging. Mr. Li said that "the construction of transportation tools must still be in line with the policy of emphasizing agriculture. The role of transportation tools is even more valuable for dredging the heavy task of agricultural production." From now on, I hope that our people will pay more attention to river channels and water conservancy. Not only should the great rivers and rivers be dredged at any time, but also the tributaries and ditches should be dredged and diverted. This function is not only to facilitate transportation and reduce freight rates, but also to increase the storage of water for irrigation. Recently, Chairman Jiang issued a notice to the provincial governments across the country, ordering each county to report its local construction implementation plan within two months. I sincerely hope that each county will pay special attention to water conservancy construction in accordance with the spirit of this notice.</p>
<p>In addition, we believe that one of the necessary conditions for revitalizing rural areas is the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. The fiscal authorities have decided to include several national taxes into local taxes to enrich local income. At the same time, they have also established donation and tax supervision committees in various provinces and counties to supervise the implementation of the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies with the power of the people. It can be said that everything is taken care of.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned conditions, the first, third, and fourth items are related to the implementation of local order, water conservancy construction, and the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. I hope that our central authorities and local personnel will work together. The second item, financial assistance, depends on the financial community. Article 7, Paragraph 8 of the Savings Law of the Ministry of Finance clearly stipulates that the total amount of collateral loans and agricultural product mortgage loans granted by savings banks to rural cooperatives shall not be less than one-fifth of the total amount of deposits. I hope that our financial community will not only fulfill its responsibilities within the scope of the law, but also go further to organize farmers' economic organizations and support production. Once rural areas are revitalized, production increases, and finance is stable, the foundation of the country can be established immediately. Therefore, the responsibility of the financial community is also heavy.</p>
<h3>Russian Consulate Staff Kidnapped and Tortured to Confess Secrets</h3>
<p>Russian Consulate Protests to the Puppet Government</p>
<p>Recognizing the Japanese and Puppet Government's Intent to Provoke</p>
<p>(Moscow) From Harbin: The Acting Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Levide, sent the following protest to Shi Luben, the "Manchukuo" negotiator. The book stated, "On December 5, Soviet citizen Lovenko, a messenger of the Soviet Consulate General, was kidnapped by an unknown Russian on Buliestan Street near his residence. According to Lovenko, two strangers approached him, one of whom shot him in the neck with a pistol, and then dragged him into a car, blindfolded him, drove him to an unfamiliar place, and threw him into a hole. A Russian with a hood on his face came forward, claiming to be a representative of the 'Russian Truth Fraternity', beat him severely, and ordered him to report the work of the Consul General and the activities of the staff of the Consulate. They also asked Mr. Lovenko to notify them of the work of the Consulate General and the visitors at any time in the future. They also questioned Mr. Lovenko, who was the representative of the State Political Department (G.P.U) among the staff of the Consulate General, and whether there were secret caves and secret radio machines in the Consulate to communicate with Moscow, etc. During the inspection, Mr. Lovenko saw that the executioners had a list of all the staff of the Consulate General, which contained detailed information on each person's position and family situation. According to the list, it should only be kept by the official authorities. Mr. Lovenko saw that one of the inspectors looked like a police detective, who had recently been paying attention to the activities of the Consulate General and its staff. Mr. Lovenko was finally taken away by a car and thrown into the street. Before leaving, they warned that if he reported this matter to the Consul General, he and his family would be executed. The next morning, Mr. Lovenko was so seriously injured that he could not move. His relatives carried him to the Consulate General and reported the above-mentioned process. The Consulate General informed the diplomatic organs and the police authorities of this matter and requested a doctor to examine Mr. Popovko. After the examination, Mr. Lovenko is now being treated in the hospital. I hereby notify you of this matter. At the same time, I must relate this move to the open surveillance of the Consulate General and its staff (especially the staff member Kanayev) by the White Russian police. I have repeatedly protested to you about the latter and demanded that the surveillance be stopped. In my official letter of December 4, I have asked you to pay attention to the provocative nature of this surveillance, and the appointment of the White Russians to this position is even more provocative. At the same time, I have told you that if anything unexpected happens, the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' authorities will be responsible. The facts of the above-mentioned Lovenko case are sufficient to show the provocative purpose of the people who inspected Mr. Lovenko. Therefore, I dare to assert that these people are clearly related to provocative organizations. I have previously asked you to pay attention to the existence of such organizations. Therefore, I firmly protest against the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' authorities' treatment of the Soviet Consulate General and the beating of the Consulate General staff member Lovenko. At the same time, I dare to say that the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' authorities should be fully responsible for this matter. I respectfully request that the whole process be thoroughly investigated and that the instigators and accomplices be severely punished." (Tas Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Nami Tsugi郎's Ambition for Puppet Policies</h3>
<p>Advocating the Establishment of a Japanese-Puppet Economic Conference First</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After this morning's cabinet meeting, the new Ambassador to the Puppet State, Nami Daisho, specially attended the meeting and reported his ambitions for the puppet policies to all cabinet members. Then he advocated that in order to promote the Japanese-Manchukuo economic group, a Japanese-Manchukuo economic conference should be established. As a result of the consultation with the cabinet members, it was decided to approve his proposal. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m. Prime Minister Okada held a banquet at his official residence to bid farewell to Ambassador Nami Daisho, and all the cabinet members accompanied him. It is reported that Ambassador Nami Daisho is in contact with the foreign affairs, finance, and business affairs authorities of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and plans to recruit experts from various provinces and national chambers of commerce and industry and economic groups in the shortest possible time.

<h3>American Manufacturers Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Requesting the Government to Increase Tariffs</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The American Toy Manufacturers Association, Textile Industry Association, and other manufacturers of products that compete with Japan have formed a common front and are planning to raise tariffs to prevent the import of Japanese goods. They have launched a fierce campaign to President Roosevelt and Congress. After receiving this letter, the Japan Economic Federation held a standing committee meeting on the 13th to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they all believed that the measures taken by the United States violated the principle of reciprocity and hoped that the United States would not take this action to exclude Japanese goods. It was decided on the 14th to inquire about this opinion from the Japan-U.S. Trade Council and then send a telegram in the name of Committee Chairman Kadono to Thomas, the chairman of the U.S.-Japan Trade Council in New York.

<h3>British, American, and Japanese Hook-up, Naval Negotiations Suddenly Change</h3>
<p>Blaming Each Other for the Failure of the Meeting</p>
<p>Representatives of the Three Countries Negotiate on the Golf Course</p>
<p>(London) The London Naval Conference is about to adjourn, but there is a new development. It is heard that the American and Japanese representatives have consulted with the British representatives in order to obtain a possible bilateral agreement in the future. Yesterday, the American and Japanese representatives denied the saying that they would initiate a British-Japanese alliance or a British-American coordination during the talks with the guests. However, diplomatic circles said that when the three-party talks were about to enter a period of extension, there was a sudden development. Britain is not eager to start discussing this matter at this time. According to the Japanese delegation, Yamamoto will not return to his country during the recess, but will stay in Britain. However, it is necessary to observe whether the current talks have achieved any results or whether the 1935 Naval Conference may be held in London in May before a decision is made. (Reuters Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives from the United Kingdom, United States, and Japan will gather in one place tomorrow. This is the first time since the start of the London Naval Conference. The place where they will gather is not a negotiating venue, but a golf course for a competition. The participants are British Foreign Secretary Simon, American representatives Davis and Standley, and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira. They will leave London tomorrow morning for the Walton Golf Course and have lunch together. As for the current status of the naval talks, the American representative advocates continuing the talks until Japan announces the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. According to the American representative, the day Japan abolishes the treaty is the day the naval conference ends. Then, the American representative will consider the possibility of returning to the United States as soon as possible to report to President Roosevelt and the State Department. The American representative opposes scheduling a date for the resumption of talks, believing that if Japan's attitude does not change, it will be of no help to resume talks.

<h3>US Representative Extends Stay Before Returning Home, Claiming it is a Diplomatic Strategy</h3>
<p>Japan Blames US for Conference Failure</p>
<p>US Representative Changes Strategy, Foiling Japan's Conspiracy</p>
<p>(London) This morning, after British Prime Minister MacDonald met with US Chief Representative Davis, it seems that the general public has understood that the various events outside the Naval Conference in recent days are purely the result of British initiative. According to the US side, Prime Minister MacDonald personally suggested to Davis that the US delegation should return home at the end of this week. MacDonald said that, in essence, if we announce the indefinite postponement of the Naval Conference after Japan declares the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, the principle of naval arms limitation will be destroyed, which will surely be disapproved by world opinion. Therefore, it is better to immediately announce the postponement of the conference at the current stage of negotiations and continue consultations through diplomatic channels to seek a basis for general understanding with Japan, which is a better strategy. MacDonald also said that after the postponement of the negotiations, Japanese Chief Expert Yamamoto will still remain in London, but only to exchange technical opinions, so there is no need to worry too much. As for the major principles of the Washington Treaty, the attitude of the UK and the US remains consistent. MacDonald's proposal was very appealing, so the US delegation had already booked passage and decided to return home this Saturday, but later changed its mind and delayed the departure. This was due to two facts: first, various newspapers were discussing the issue, trying to shift the responsibility for the sudden suspension of the Naval Conference to the US. The US delegation immediately denied this kind of discussion and strongly corrected it. Second, Yamamoto's statement indicated that the Japanese government would make further clarifications. Due to these two facts, when MacDonald met with Davis this morning and made a statement, Davis immediately replied that the US delegation could not arrange everything in time, and the ship departing on Saturday was already impossible to board. They would now have to take the ship departing on December 29 to return home. Before that date, they would still be ready to receive instructions at any time. The general public now has the impression that this response by the US delegation has achieved partial success. The Japanese delegation declared last night that the instructions from the Tokyo government could arrive at any moment, but as of this afternoon, the Tokyo government had made no indication and had not responded to the Japanese delegation's inquiry about whether to change its initial position. According to the US representatives' speculation, the Japanese delegation must have received instructions from the Tokyo government last night, but was also ordered to publish these instructions only after the US representatives departed, in order to shift the responsibility to the US. Now that the US delegation has changed its plans and delayed its return, this attempt by Japan has failed. Last night, a US representative told someone that the situation of the naval negotiations remains the same as before yesterday, but they have now avoided one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes in US history. The inside story of the diplomatic maneuvers between the US and Japan can be understood from this statement. (Havas Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to today's newspapers here, British Prime Minister MacDonald and US Representative Davis have agreed that the London Naval Preparatory Conference will officially adjourn on December 20. However, it is understood that the representatives of the UK, US, and Japan will continue informal talks to wait for the conference to reopen in the spring of next year. Davis stated at yesterday's meeting that if there is no hope of establishing a new naval treaty, the US representatives will not return to London. He also asked the UK to agree that after the withdrawal of the US representatives, the negotiations will proceed through diplomatic channels of the three countries. It is learned that MacDonald and Davis did not discuss next year's naval conference. The Japanese representatives want to determine the date of the reopening as a condition for agreeing to the temporary suspension of the current talks. (Guomin Cable, 14th)</p>
<h3>Yamamoto and British Chief of Staff Agreed on a Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>Content Transmitted by Japanese Cable</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Representative Major General Yamamoto visited British Naval Chief of Staff Chatfield on the 13th. The content of the meeting has not been released. The US delegation has always claimed that Japan has no constructive attitude and criticized its refusal to clearly state specific figures, saying that if Japan does not change its attitude, there is no need to reopen the talks. Yamamoto's meeting with Chatfield seems to indicate the reason why Japan did not clearly state specific figures and hopes to continue the talks to establish a new agreement. (Rengo Cable, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The content of the compromise plan agreed upon by Representative Yamamoto and British Chief of Staff Chatfield is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan, based on the compromise plan previously proposed by the UK, acknowledges the principle of naval power equality.</p>
<p>(2) Each country will automatically announce its own shipbuilding plans in the coming years.</p>
<p>(3) The declaration will abolish the ratio system and will not be bound by treaties or other international constraints.</p>
<p>(4) The UK will not oppose shipbuilding plans and will determine the proposal for the maximum limit.</p>
<p>(5) The UK, due to its territories scattered around the world, advocates the principle of a large number of small ships.</p>
<p>(6) For the above reasons, a 30% qualitative reduction will be applied to various warships, namely, capital ships will be limited to 25,000 tons, aircraft carriers to 20,000 tons, and cruisers to 7,000 tons. The number of ships reduced can be used for the construction of cruisers of 7,000 tons, with 70 cruisers. It is hoped that a few percent of the existing strength will be reduced as the maximum limit.</p>
<p>(7) Japan should have the same naval power as the UK, but it is impossible to reach the above-mentioned power from the current state in one fell swoop. Therefore, shipbuilding will be carried out gradually to achieve the goal. (Rengo Cable, 14th)</p>
<h3>Whether to Adjourn Depends on Japan's Response</h3>
<p>Yamamoto Stays in London to Observe</p>
<p>(London) As a result of the US delegation's advocacy for continued talks, the UK's plan to adjourn the conference has completely failed. It has to decide on the following three fundamental issues: (1) Continue the talks; (2) Announce the adjournment and reopen next year; (3) Dissolve the conference. The UK is waiting for the Tokyo government's response to the compromise plan created by Yamamoto and Chatfield before deciding on this issue. If the Japanese government approves the compromise plan and agrees to continue talks with the UK and Japan, it will withdraw its proposal to adjourn and continue the talks. Otherwise, it will have to announce an indefinite adjournment. (Rengo Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Representative Yamamoto has decided to suspend all preparations for returning home due to the gradual changes in the adjournment plan proposed by the British government and will temporarily observe the situation. If the Japanese government's response instructs him to continue consultations after the winter solstice or if there is hope of holding a formal conference before May 1935, he intends to stay in the UK. (Rengo Cable, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British proposed adjourning the negotiations in November and reopening them in March or April next year. After receiving a telegram from Representative Matsudaira, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately consulted with the Ministry of the Navy and decided on the following response, which will be sent out tonight or tomorrow: (1) They agree to the adjournment, but Japan's new arms reduction plan is very complete, and the Washington Treaty of eleven years ago is outdated. If the UK and the US are willing to accept Japan's proposal, Japan is ready to present specific figures; (2) Even though Japan's proposal has not been accepted by the UK and the US, Japan will continue to negotiate until it achieves its claims before adjourning. (Hualian Cable, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The US representative was scheduled to return home on the 15th, but it is reported that the departure has been postponed. The Japanese naval authorities have the following observations on this report: the US side's proposal for a 20% general reduction and the responsibility for the breakdown of the initial talks are all intended to prevent Japan from announcing the abolition of the treaty and, when they know of Japan's firm intention to announce the abolition, to attribute the responsibility for the breakdown of Japan's announcement and the representatives' return to Japan. The British side, seeing this situation, proposed adjourning the conference on the 20th before Japan's announcement. If the representatives return home before that date, the responsibility for ending the talks cannot but be borne by the US side. Therefore, the departure is postponed until after the announcement. If a discussion of responsibility arises, it will be said that a new situation has arisen due to Japan's announcement, intending to shift the responsibility to Japan. Furthermore, the postponement of the return of the US representatives seems to be intended to observe the outcome of the private agreement being conducted by Yamamoto and Chatfield, in order to inform future countermeasures.

<h3>Japan's Navy Organizes Wartime Structure</h3>
<p>Consolidating the Defenses of Naval Districts</p>
<p>New Commanders Appointed to Each Unit</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Navy announced today a military order that will add defense squadrons to each naval district. The squadron will be organized with special service ships and coastal defense ships to consolidate the defenses of the naval districts. The commanders of the named squadrons have been decided as follows: Kasuya as Rear Admiral for Yokosuka, Ando as Rear Admiral for Kure, and Ka Ken as Rear Admiral for Sasebo. Appointments will be made tomorrow. The Japanese Navy newly formed a security squadron last year, and now it is organizing a defense squadron, which shows that the entire navy is being organized for wartime. (Hualian Cable, 14th)</p>
<h3>US War Profits Committee Begins Drafting Procedures</h3>
<p>Preparing to Adopt Old Cases from the Hoover Era - To Prevent Prices from Soaring When War Occurs</p>
<p>Establishing Mechanisms to Quickly Requisition National Industries</p>
<p>(Washington) Senatorial Arms Trade Investigation Committee accused President Roosevelt of trying to obstruct the investigation. President Roosevelt today issued an order, arguing that the War Profits Committee organized yesterday should cooperate with the Senate Committee to formulate legislation to collect war profits. President Roosevelt's move is intended to ease the emotions of the Arms Investigation Committee, because the committee has issued a warning that if it wants to obstruct the arms investigation, there will be fierce disputes in Congress. The procedures drafted by Baruch and Johnson of the War Profits Committee will be nothing more than the following three main points: (1) When war occurs, prices will be immediately frozen without soaring; (2) Heavy donations will be levied to eliminate war profits. On this point, it will be proposed that those whose income exceeds the average of the past three years will be levied 95% of income tax; (3) Establish mechanisms to quickly requisition all industries in the country in wartime. The figures obtained by the Senate Arms Investigation Committee today show that the profits earned by some companies manufacturing munitions during wartime are 20% to 362% compared with their paid-up capital. Many large companies make profits of at least 40% and as much as 75%. DuPont, the owner of Hengxin Bank, has protested, saying that the above-mentioned surplus figures are misleading, because the government has taken away 80% of the profits by levying excessive profit taxes. (Reuters Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The War Profits Committee appointed by President Roosevelt declared war on arms dealers and today revived an old plan proposed by the War Policy Committee of the former President Hoover era. The plan was drafted in 1932, but was shelved due to the banking crisis and government changes. However, the Army and Navy departments have approved the recommendation, so it can be submitted to Congress as long as someone advocates it. However, it is still questionable whether the President's committee is willing to adopt the old case or discuss a new method. The old case will probably be adopted. As for the content of the old case, it includes various regulations on national requisition of manpower and financial resources in wartime. The profits of the munitions manufacturing industry are limited to 6%, and a special committee is set up to preside over the adjustment of munitions manufacturing, purchase, distribution, and other wartime activities of the government. The War Profits Committee now plans to meet daily to collect all materials and formulate an accurate plan to submit to the President, who will then send it to Congress by special message.

<h3>Establishment of the London German Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Developing Trade as its Mission</p>
<p>(London) Today is the opening day of the German Chamber of Commerce here. Many British and German people attended the ceremony. Dr. MacKay served as the interim chairman, and later MacKay was unanimously elected as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce by the General Assembly. MacKay immediately said that the establishment of the German Chamber of Commerce in London is a long-felt need. However, this organization is purely commercial in nature and will not be involved in the politics of the two countries in the future. It aims to develop trade between Britain and Germany and holds the term "fair trade" as the guiding principle for its activities. MacKay also said that the German Chamber of Commerce has been established for many years in Paris, New York, Amsterdam, Milan and other ports, but London has been missing for a long time, which is very strange. MacKay also said that the German cotton textile industry is particularly pleased with the establishment of the London German Chamber of Commerce, and no less than 800 cotton textile factories have joined the new Chamber of Commerce as members. German Ambassador to the UK Hesch also gave a speech and, on behalf of German Head of State Hitler, congratulated the Chamber on its bright future. (Guomin Cable, 13th)</p>
<h3>US Recovery Regulations</h3>
<p>Points that Need to be Revised</p>
<p>(New York) Chairman William of the Reconstruction Committee delivered his first speech since taking office today, saying that the National Industrial Recovery Act will be greatly revised in the next Congress. If Congress accepts the committee's recommendations, the suspicion of controlling prices in the recovery law will be abolished. Other suggestions of the committee are as follows: (1) eliminate child labor; (2) Stipulate the minimum wage; (3) Stipulate the maximum working hours; (4) Guarantee group negotiation; (5) Prohibit unfair commercial behavior.

<h3>Saar Security Issues</h3>
<p>Committee Discussion Ends</p>
<p>The First Batch of British Troops Arrives</p>
<p>(Geneva) The subcommittee commissioned by the International Administrative Council to handle the opening of the International Police Force into the Saar has come to an end today. It is learned that this police force has infantry squads, armored vehicle squads, etc. The police force must be mobilized quickly, so it must be equipped with many cars so that half of the police force personnel can be transported to any location at any time. The security issues in the Saar region are still the responsibility of the ruling committee of the region. The Commander-in-Chief of the International Police Force must listen to the Chairman of the Committee, Knox. The commander will go to Saarbrucken to discuss the deployment and distribution of the police force with the committee. The country joining the police force must send an officer to form the cadre of the Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief will consult with the committee on the dispatch and deployment of the various matters. The transportation costs of the police force are borne by the Saar ruling committee. According to the resolution of the International Administrative Council on December 11, the expenditures are paid from the regular expenses. The funds advanced by various countries due to the opening of the police force into the Saar are also reimbursed by the item. (Guomin Cable, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The first batch of British troops joining the police force in the Saar region has arrived in Calais and is temporarily stationed in the barracks. The officers in uniform rushed to Saarbrucken. The team will be stationed until next Tuesday, waiting for the arrival of the entire team. During the three months that the British police force is stationed in the Saar, the British army will take Calais as its base. British Commander-in-Chief Major General Blanding went to Saarbrucken today. (Guomin Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>Saarbruecken The Commander-in-Chief of the International Police Force, Blaine, arrived here from England today, accompanied by an adjutant and three staff officers. Dutch Army Commander Hukstedt also arrived here today. The Saar Management Committee is currently handling various technical details regarding the entry of foreign troops and the preparation of the referendum on January 13. Nine hundred people from neutral countries will monitor the voting. There will be one person from a neutral country at each polling place to supervise the scene, supplemented by two people from opposing sides, and the International Police Force will be responsible for the protection.

<h3>German Cabinet Passes Ten Bills</h3>
<p>Clamp Down on Speech and Severely Punish Terrorists</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Cabinet passed ten bills at its last meeting this year. One of them stipulates that those who make incorrect remarks that damage the reputation of the government or the National Socialist Party, and those who wear the uniform or emblem of the National Socialist Party and commit punishable crimes, will be imprisoned. If the offender's purpose is to cause disturbances or create terror, he will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death. Germans who commit crimes abroad must also be punished. There is also a case that stipulates that those who are disabled for the National Socialist struggle will be given pensions. Another case stipulates that voluntary labor team members must be subject to military discipline in the team. German Head of State Hitler announced at today's cabinet meeting that the New Year's reception for government personnel at the Presidential Palace in previous years will be cancelled this year.

<h3>Austro-Hungarian Unity</h3>
<p>Hungary Welcomes with Great Ceremony</p>
<p>Austrian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Reciprocate Visit</p>
<p>Budapest Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg, Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg, and many other Austrian government officials arrived in the Hungarian capital today. This is the first visit of Austrian government officials to Hungary, so the Hungarian side's welcoming ceremony was very grand. Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, Foreign Minister Kanya, and other cabinet members all went to the station to welcome them. Others who went to the station included the Hungarian capital's police chief, the mayor of the Hungarian capital, and the Austrian minister to Hungary. This evening's evening newspaper published Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg's declaration, praising the friendship between Austria and Hungary and saying that future negotiations between the two countries should be limited to the scope of existing treaties. It is also heard that Schuschnigg et al. are scheduled to return to Austria on Saturday afternoon. (Guomin Agency Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>Vienna The Federal Post published a conversation with Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya today, saying that Hungary's attitude toward Yugoslavia has now been slightly eased. The interview also has a brief description of the key points of the agreement recently established in Geneva. Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya said that the enemies of Hungary's attempt to insult Hungary has now completely failed, and Hungary has not accepted any punishment from the League of Nations. When the League of Nations was drawing up its resolutions, it also had no intention of interfering in Hungary's internal affairs. The Hungarian Foreign Minister has returned to Hungary today, because Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg are going to Hungary today, and Kanya needs to return in advance to participate in the welcome. (Guomin Agency Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>Vienna Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya was recently interviewed by a reporter from the Vienna Federal Post, and made a statement, saying that Hungary should continue to seek to implement its national ideals by peaceful means. All the opposing countries want to make Hungary concede and abandon the issue of revising the treaty, but they have not been successful. One section of the Executive Council's resolution asking member states to respect territorial integrity is intended to persuade member states not to use military force to destroy the territorial integrity of member states. As for amending the treaty by peaceful means, it should not be regarded as the same way. (Havas Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>Belgrade Foreign Minister Yevtic returned to the country from Geneva, passed through the city of Zagreb, and made a speech, saying that the League of Nations Executive Council's resolution on the South Hungarian dispute is satisfactory in both legal and moral terms. Yugoslavia's peaceful spirit and its concept of abiding by international obligations are respected by all countries, as can be evidenced at this Executive Council meeting. (Havas Cable, 13th)</p>
<p>Budapest According to the semi-official Hungarian Jing Lauyi newspaper, after Prime Minister Gobos met with Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg, representatives of Italy and Hungary will hold talks before French Foreign Minister Laval visits Italy. The purpose of this talk is to determine the conditions for other countries to join the Rome Agreement. Press Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya recently issued a declaration stating, "If the status of Hungarian minorities in the countries along the Danube River can be improved, the solution of the economic problems in the Danube River basin will inevitably be more convenient." However, Hungary will take the issue of minorities as a prerequisite, at least temporarily abandoning the claim of revising the treaty, and demanding specific benefits for minorities. It is clear that Hungary and the Little Entente countries have not been able to reach an agreement because the claim to amend the treaty is in the way. This is known to everyone in the world.

<h3>Bulgaria Bans Political Parties</h3>
<p>Orders Confiscation of Property</p>
<p>Sofia The government has ordered the confiscation of all properties owned by past political parties. (Havas Cable, 14th) Sofia The Bulgarian Cabinet met today and resolved to completely dissolve all political parties and confiscate their houses and funds. First, Prime Minister Colonel Georgiev announced to his colleagues that in order to prevent the national politics and morality from becoming increasingly corrupt, he had to take this measure. Then it was put to a vote and unanimously approved. The current semi-military government was approved by King Boris of Bulgaria in May of this year. Since taking office, it has been dedicated to eradicating enemy parties and has announced that it intends to govern Bulgaria by order for one year in accordance with Article 47 of the Constitution. According to the provisions of this article, when the situation in various countries, foreign or domestic, is tight and the Congress cannot be called by telegram, the king may command the government for one year by order. After this, the Congress must add approval to all orders. (Reuters Cable, 13th)</p>

<h3>National Situation of Abolishing Excessive Taxes in Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Publishes an Article</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi published an article describing the situation of various provinces and cities across the country reducing land tax surcharges and abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes. The original text was over 2,000 words long. It first stated that in the past few months, more than 3,000 tax items have been abolished in 23 provinces and cities, with the amount of taxes already abolished exceeding 28 million. More than 9 million will soon be abolished, totaling more than 30 million. He hoped that the Party would strictly supervise and encourage the local Party bureaus to continue to move forward, maintain a firm heart with perseverance, and not allow any trivialities to remain or anyone to be excluded. Finally, he stated that annual budgets and monthly estimates are essential, and the country has regular expenses. Without a budget, there is no way to follow in financial matters. In the past, local budgets were not prepared according to law because order had not been restored or government orders had not been widely disseminated. Since this financial conference, the provinces have also ordered counties to implement preliminary budgets. Currently, those that have handled county budgets and have started to compile and review them include Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Gansu provinces. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, and Hebei have also convened county magistrate group meetings to actively carry out work and have achieved considerable results. Other items, such as reorganizing various legitimate taxes, reforming the land tax collection system, unifying accounting, and consolidating debts, vary from province to province and are not entirely the same. However, the ministry adheres to the central government's intentions, either by prescribing unified methods or by providing separate and appropriate guidance. Local governments are also making efforts to achieve success within a specified time frame by adapting to local conditions. In the future, the ministry will continue to urge them with sincerity and earnestness to ensure that there are no interruptions, and will gradually establish supervision committees in various provinces and cities to achieve the effect of publicizing people's opinions and making finances transparent.

<h3>The War Zone Clearing Committee Will Establish Seven Offices</h3>

<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Clearing Committee decided to handle the disputes between the Yutian Security Team and the militia fairly. Illegal militias will be thoroughly resolved, and unscrupulous elements in the security team will also be cleaned up to seek a permanent solution. In addition to Zhu Shiqin, a standing committee member of the committee, those responsible for presiding over the matter include special commissioners Chen Junmo and Yang Zhiguo, a total of seven people.

<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong talked about the reorganization of the Yutian Security Team and militia has been completed and is being presided over by the War Zone Clearing Committee.

<h3>It May Be Difficult for the Hebei Provincial Government to Work Together on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that the date for the Hebei Provincial Government to move to Baoding has not yet been determined. Personnel will be sent within the month to inspect the houses. It is feared that it will not be possible to realize the joint office of the provincial government on New Year's Day next year due to the cumbersome preparations. However, there is no doubt that the plan will be implemented. Or it may be delayed for a few days and implemented when the provincial government moves to Baoding. The abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes in Hebei Province is due to the lack of compensation funds. The excessive and miscellaneous taxes in each county are related to education funds. Once they are abolished, they will inevitably be suspended. And each type of excessive and miscellaneous taxes involves many uses. Before a thorough plan is made, it cannot be rashly abolished. Therefore, although the province is trying its best to complete the abolition by the end of the year as scheduled, it is actually difficult to do so. Only slowly figure it out.

<h3>Tight Credit in Beiping City</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Credit in Beiping City has been quite tight recently. The cash reserves of various banks here are due to the cotton harvest season, and a large amount of cash will flow into the rural areas. Therefore, two months ago, each bank separately remitted cash to Beiping from Shanghai, amounting to more than 5 million yuan. According to previous years, the situation is better than this year with 5 million cash injections in the city. The reason why it has not yet eased is that a certain country is privately collecting cash and transporting it to Dalian one after another. If the authorities do not strictly investigate and prohibit it, the city's credit will become more and more urgent. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

(The spot exchange rate of 999 yuan and two jiao can be used as a thousand yuan.) To individual transport foreign thousand yuan to Shanghai, the premium can reach tens of yuan huge. Therefore, the market was shocked, and people were panicked. Today, the managers of various money houses held a meeting to discuss relief measures. The result was that in the future, all banknotes that can be cashed in transactions with peers will be treated as silver dollars. (Foreign bank banknotes and Zhejiang Xingye Bank banknotes are rejected because there are no exchange places in Suzhou.) Now the storm has subsided, the closing Shanghai exchange rate has risen by five cents, and the market discount has also fallen to one jiao and five cents. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Thorough Investigation of the Palace Museum Treasure Theft Case</h3>
<p>Report Submitted by the Committee for the Preservation of Antiquities Regarding the Investigation's Progress</p>
<p>Yi Peiji Refuses to Appear in Court; Request for Strict Punishment According to the Law</p>
<p>Beijing dispatch: The central government, considering Yi Peiji and others' theft and replacement of Palace Museum jewels as extremely unlawful, ordered the relevant authorities to investigate and prosecute according to the law. The Executive Yuan then instructed the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee to investigate. It is now known that, apart from submitting a separate report for instructions regarding the Marseille smuggling of antiquities, the committee yesterday submitted a report to the Executive Yuan regarding the investigation into the Palace Museum jewel theft case, requesting that it be presented to the National Government for assigning judicial organs to handle the matter according to law, in order to maintain national credibility. The original report is as follows:</p>
<p>"In accordance with the Executive Yuan's order No. 5889 to strictly investigate the Palace Museum jewel theft and the Marseille discovery of smuggled antiquities, a temporary plenary committee meeting was convened on the 23rd of this month to discuss the jewel theft case. The prosecutor in charge of the case from the Jiangning District Court was invited to attend and explain the case's progress. After detailed questioning by the committee members, the attending prosecutors answered one by one. After careful study by the committee members, it was unanimously agreed that the Palace Museum had a detailed procedure for withdrawing items, with the departments and curators of the museum jointly dispatching personnel to handle the withdrawals. However, the museum director, Yi Peiji, and the secretary-general, Li Zongtong, did not comply with the regulations when withdrawing items. They arbitrarily withdrew items and stored them in the office, without assigning personnel to guard them or recording them in registers. Furthermore, according to the museum's organizational regulations, the Ancient Artifacts Hall should have been responsible for jewels, but the museum director transferred them to the secretary's office for safekeeping. The secretary's office safekeeping was equivalent to Yi Peiji and Li Zongtong personally safekeeping them. The items personally kept by the museum director and secretary-general developed shortcomings such as shortages and replacements with fakes, which is far from the intention of careful preservation of antiquities as outlined in the museum's regulations for withdrawing items. This is the first point of suspicion of theft and replacement. The crowns and robes of past emperors and empresses are extremely valuable historically and are also among the museum's precious items. When the antiquities were transported south, the museum director and others, under the pretext of facilitating transport, secretly dispatched trusted personnel to hide in a quiet room and dismantle the jewels from these crowns and robes. Even if it was necessary to dismantle and transport the jewels on these crowns and robes separately, the reasons should have been clearly stated and submitted to the government for approval, or the relevant departments of the museum should have been consulted for joint handling, to show openness. The museum director and others did not do this, but instead dismantled them without authorization. This is the second point of suspicion of theft and replacement. In 1925, the Committee for the Disposition of Qing Dynasty Assets employed experts to appraise the Qing Dynasty inventory, which was extremely detailed. Even when the museum director received these items, he did not voice any objections. However, the prosecutor's investigation revealed that the museum director, Yi Peiji, and secretary-general, Li Zongtong, had successively stolen some of the jewels in their custody, including 1,319 real pearls and 526 gemstones, replacing 9,606 real pearls with fake pearls and 3,251 real gemstones with fake gemstones. They also removed jewel accessories from 1,496 original items, and even stole entire items such as embroidered pearl tassels and jade flower inlaid jewel bracelets, in large quantities. This is even more evident and verifiable. This is the third point of suspicion of theft and replacement. In summary, based on the above three points, the museum director is indeed strongly suspected of stealing and replacing Palace Museum jewels. Now that this case has been brought to court and reported in newspapers, it is widely known at home and abroad, and people across the country are severely criticizing it. Moreover, the court has completed its investigation, which has taken a long time and involved considerable effort. The materials obtained are sufficient as a basis, and a public prosecution has already been filed. If the museum director is not guilty of theft, he should step forward and present a defense, and would have nothing to fear from the country's laws. Why then is he using the concession and his political position to repeatedly refuse to appear in court? This further shows that Yi Peiji and others are clearly guilty and have no defense. Now that the court has filed a public prosecution in this case, the committee sees no need to reinvestigate. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan forward this to the National Government, instructing the Judicial Yuan to promptly conduct the trial, in order to dispel public doubts. Furthermore, the dignity of the law is the basis of national credibility, and judicial officials should be persons who implement national laws. The country should entrust them with full power and protect their safety with national authority, so that they can always fully exercise their joint authority and render a prompt judgment according to law, in order to maintain the spirit of judicial independence in a country ruled by law. This was resolved and recorded. Based on the aforementioned order, in addition to submitting a separate report for instructions regarding the Marseille smuggling of antiquities, we respectfully submit this document to the Executive Yuan, reporting the progress of the committee's handling of the Palace Museum jewel theft case, for your review and implementation. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan, Central Antiquities Preservation Committee." (14th)</p>
<h3>Organization of the Fujian-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>Draft Organizational Regulations Have Been Issued</p>
<p>Jiang Dingwen Discusses Future Pacification Work</p>
<p>Xiamen communication: After the disbandment of the East Route Headquarters, it was reorganized into the Fujian Pacification Commissioner's Office, which was established on the first of this month. On the same day, Jiang Dingwen telegraphed his assumption of the post of Pacification Commissioner of Fujian. Recently, the draft organizational regulations have been sent from Nanchang, and the original text is as follows: "Draft Organizational Regulations for the Fujian Pacification Commissioner's Office," Article 1: A Fujian Pacification Commissioner's Office is specially established to handle pacification matters in Fujian Province, presided over by the Fujian Pacification Commissioner. Article 2: The Fujian Pacification Commissioner is appointed by the National Government and is subordinate to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and is guided by the Chief of Staff and the Minister of Military Affairs. Article 3: According to the situation in Fujian Province, the province is divided into several pacification zones under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Commissioner. Each zone is to have one commander, and deputy commanders may be appointed as appropriate. The zones are to be determined separately. To promote the suppression of bandits, a commander of the reserve army is to be appointed under the Pacification Commissioner. Article 4: The Pacification Commissioner's Office is to have one chief of staff to assist the commissioner in handling all matters, and is to be divided into staff, secretariat, party affairs, adjutant, military law, military medical, logistics, and transportation departments. The organization chart is to be determined separately. Article 5: The duties of the Pacification Commissioner are as follows: 1. Eliminate residual bandits in the area. 2. Complete transportation in the area. 3. Console and care for refugees. 4. Supervise and guide the organization and training of the masses. 5. Handle post-banditry affairs in bandit-affected areas. 6. Be responsible for reorganizing and training local militias and provincial security forces in the area, and supervise all their financial affairs. Article 6: The armies and local militias in each pacification zone under the jurisdiction are to be under the command of the Pacification Commissioner. Article 7: In order to implement pacification, the Pacification Commissioner may direct the administrative supervisors, security commanders, and county governments of the areas under their jurisdiction and adjacent border areas at any time. Article 8: The Pacification Commissioner should consult with the provincial party headquarters and provincial government to handle party and government affairs in each pacification zone under their jurisdiction, but may take appropriate action when necessary. Article 9: These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any incomplete matters. Article 10: These regulations are to be implemented from the date of their promulgation.</p>
<p>The above draft will be implemented after it is submitted to the central government for approval and promulgation. Currently, the Pacification Headquarters has eight departments according to the regulations, and the original department heads of the East Route Headquarters will concurrently hold the positions. After the organization is approved, they will be formally commissioned. Personnel above the department head level will not be changed, and the scope of personnel below that level will be slightly reduced, and the personnel will generally not be transferred. Jiang Dingwen returned to Zhangzhou on the 6th and met with newspaper reporters at the Pacification Headquarters on the 8th to discuss pacification work, saying: The aftermath of Fujian Province is a complicated matter, but the main task is to enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment and to devote themselves to production, without which it will be impossible to proceed. At present, it is difficult to talk about construction. Western and Northern Fujian have been plagued by bandits for many years and have suffered deeply. Although the main bandits have fled westward, the remaining bandits are still lurking, so it is still necessary to carry out searches and suppression in these two areas, and to engage in post-banditry work in the bandit areas. In Southern Fujian, although the bandit atmosphere has been killed, the local situation in the past was complicated, and incidents of scattered bandits kidnapping, killing, and robbing still occur, causing overseas Chinese to be reluctant to return and few to invest in construction. The people are also deeply oppressed by local tyrants and gentry, and have no way to appeal. The current government is not the same as it used to be, and in the future, the people can freely complain to various military and political organs. If any bad troops or local corrupt tyrants are found, they should be reported as much as possible, so that the government can bring them to justice and will never tolerate them, so that fraudsters and corrupt officials have no way to use their skills. Regarding the militia issue, the government previously recruited 16 or 17 militia regiments, which is not a small number, but perhaps because the handling was not perfect, there were still rebellions or desertions with weapons, so I (Jiang himself) have given this serious attention, hoping to find a thorough solution. My opinion is to first treat these people with a tolerant attitude, guide them to the right path, give them a bright future, and take the path of self-renewal. If they are still stubborn and cause harm, they should be thoroughly eliminated, because many bandits are forced by life, and many of the militias in Fujian Province are also related to the revolution. Regarding the blockade issue in Fujian Province, because the main bandits have fled westward, there is no need to continue the blockade. If the blockade is still maintained because of a few scattered bandits, it will not only affect the people's livelihood, but also hinder the reconstruction work in the bandit areas, and there are also those who take advantage of the blockade to engage in private gain and malpractice. I went to Nanchang this time and asked Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to lift the blockade, which is expected to be realized in a few days. Furthermore, the province plans to have four pacification zones: the 12th Zone in Eastern Fujian, commanded by Wang Jingqin; the 11th Zone in Central and Southern Fujian, commanded by Li Yannian; the 10th Zone in Western Fujian, commanded by Wei Lihuang; and the 9th Zone in Northern Fujian, commanded by Liu Heding. The headquarters of each zone will be established soon, and the troops under the command of each zone headquarters are expected to be fully transferred by the end of the month. The Southern Route Army stationed in Yongding, Shanghang, and Wuping counties in Western Fujian has all been withdrawn to Guangdong, and teams have been sent to take over the defense of the abandoned land, etc.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Pacification Headquarters, Jiang convened a meeting of department heads and decided to first carry out clearing of the countryside by zone. It is planned to convene a pacification meeting in Zhangzhou in the middle of this month for all military leaders in the province to discuss the clearing of the countryside. As for the headquarters of the four pacification zones in the province, it is expected that they will be formally established on New Year's Day after the troops have been transferred, and the clearing of the countryside will begin immediately (10th).</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Whole Family Killed for Acting as Informants</p>
<p>Wang Caiting, a resident of Xianzishan outside Xiamen, acted as an informant for the water police, capturing bandits, which led to deep hatred with the bandits. On the 29th of last month, more than 30 bandits went to Wang Caiting's house and shot and killed Wang Caiting, his wife Wang Zhou, and his nephew Wang Xiaohei Yuan, throwing their bodies into the river in the southeastern part of Yangcheng Lake. The deceased's younger brother, Wang Maomao, reported this to the Water Public Security Second District and requested an investigation to avenge the deceased. Chief Zhou immediately dispatched detectives to Yangcheng Lake yesterday (14th) to retrieve the bodies and strictly pursue the perpetrators. A suspect in the case, Yao Huquan, was captured in the countryside yesterday and immediately taken to the district for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hidden Bandits Captured in Hengtang Township</h3>
<p>Li Guozhen, the detective team leader of the Water Public Security Second District of Jiangsu Province, received a report from Pan Yushan that bandits were hiding in Hengtang, discussing robbery and other matters. He dispatched detectives Wan Zhinan, Hu Xianzhang, Liu Jintang, Liu Hongkui, etc., to secretly go to Hengtang to ambush and arrest them. They caught bandits Wu Yaoyuan, Zhang Qinghan, Zhu Wenming, and Zhong Benying on the spot and took them to the city for interrogation. Zhang Qinghan confessed that he had served as a soldier in the Northeast and as a tax police officer under Zhang Jinbang, the deputy captain of the 56th Team of the 8th Tax Police District of Jiangsu Province. Now Captain Zhang has retired and lives at No. 11 Xibanpian Lane, Jianpanmen. Yesterday, I went to his house from Xietang and saw Zhu Wenming playing mahjong, and Wu Yaoyuan and Zhong Benying were there. Captain Zhang took out two box guns and one pistol and told us to go to Shanren Bridge to commit a crime. Today, he first asked us to check the wind conditions, so we went to Hengtang, which led to our arrest, etc. After the interrogation, at 2:00 AM that night (13th), detectives were dispatched with Zhang Qinghan to go to Xibanpian Lane and arrest the principal offender Zhang Jinbang and Zhang Desheng, Xu Peichun, and three others, and the weapons provided were searched out, and they were taken into custody for interrogation. Whether these bandits are related to the recent robberies in Suzhou is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>As I Heard It</h3>
<p>A Fake Country Establishes an Agency to Buy Women</p>
<p>The Second Public Security Bureau received a report from Xu Qingsheng and others that Yin Yuqing, the younger brother of Yin Yurun at No. 10 Xinxueqian, had recently been entrusted by a fake country to establish an agency in Suzhou to buy women, intending to transport the women to Fengtian to become prostitutes. The agency is located in the Guanquan area and has more than 20 employees. Yuqing recently abducted his niece Guiyuan (20 years old) and sold her to the agency for 300 yuan. She was transported to the Huizhong Hotel in Shanghai yesterday and is waiting to be transported to Fengtian. Guiyuan's father, Yurun, is unable to move due to illness and misses his daughter so much that he cries day and night, asking for an arrest, etc. Director Huang of the branch dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed that Guiyuan was indeed not at home, and Yin Yuqing's words were ambiguous, indicating a strong suspicion of abduction and sale. He was immediately taken to the bureau for interrogation. However, a thorough search of the Guanquan area revealed no agency for buying women. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Liangxi Ice Factory Set on Fire Again</p>
<p>This county's ice factory, only Lijian's this summer, because of the extremely hot weather, had a thriving business. Generally, speculators organized and rushed to the market. A few days ago, the Wuxi Ice Factory near Taying Bridge outside the East Gate was suddenly set on fire, burning down an ice pool and causing considerable losses. At half past midnight yesterday morning, the Liangxi Ice Factory in Houyang Lane near the Yeqin Yarn Factory also caught fire. Fortunately, the fire brigades of various sections were able to put out the fire, but one half of the ice house was burned down, causing losses of 800 to 900 yuan. According to the person in charge of the factory, the ice factory is surrounded by bamboo fences. The cause of this fire must have been arson by wicked people out of jealousy. At that time, the fire was thrown from the outside onto the thatched roof, and because the guard was already asleep, it became a prairie fire. Now the factory, in conjunction with Wuxi Ice Factory, has widely advertised in various local newspapers, offering a reward for the arrest of the arsonists.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Education Delegation Visits Wuxi</h3>
<p>In order to improve education in Tianjin, the Tianjin Education Bureau specially organized an education visit delegation to visit Beijing, Shanghai, and various provinces and cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong. The delegation members Liu Dehui, Liu Xianzhang, Zhang Qingyuan, Du Zhixin, Liu Yanling, Huang Yuqi, Li Yantian, Wu Shiming, and others, a group of nine people, arrived in Wuxi by train from Beijing at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday and stayed at the Wuxi Hotel. Yesterday, they visited the central elementary school and the attached elementary school of the Wuxi Normal School in the urban area separately. They are scheduled to leave Wuxi today to visit various ports in Suzhou and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fugitive Bandit Arrested and Sent to the County</h3>
<p>Xu Jinhe's family in Yanqiao Township, the fifth district, was robbed in April 1930, suffering heavy losses. Xu Jinhe reported to the county government, and the bandit was arrested and detained. There was also a fugitive bandit named Xu Ayao, who was wanted by the county government. Recently, Ayao secretly returned to Wuxi and hid in the house of a certain family in Sitou Town, which led to his arrest by the police of the Fifth Sub-Station of the Directly Subordinate Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he was presented to the General Bureau and transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Robbery Case at Mantang Temple in the Second District Solved</p>
<p>Ye Lianbao, a farmer in Hedong, Mantang Temple, Jingxi Township, the ninth district of Wujin County, had some savings. On the evening of the 10th of this month, a group of bandits suddenly came and wantonly searched. On that day, Ye Lianbao went to the city for business, leaving only his wife Liu and his 14-year-old young son at home. The bandits found no silver dollars in the search, so they carried away a cow, white rice, and other clothing. The next day, Xu Chengyong, a patrolman of the Eighth Sub-Station of the Public Security Bureau, reported the incident and immediately sent police to investigate. He soon arrested the bandits Wu Fugen, Jin Suojin, and the female bandit Wu Liuzhong and brought them to the station for preliminary interrogation. They confessed to the robbery and were sent to the Public Security Bureau in the city for interrogation on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Case of Missing Gun from Security Team</p>
<p>Former Battalion Commander Taken into Custody</p>
<p>The company commander of the First Company of the County Security Team was dismissed for cause, and his vacancy was filled by Yu Jiankui, appointed by the Provincial Committee. Unexpectedly, when Yu took over, he suddenly discovered that a box cannon was missing. After detailed investigation, it was found that the secretary Yao Zhengjia was highly suspected. He was arrested and detained. After the battalion commander personally interrogated him, Yao testified that the gun was with the former commander Fan Zhengshan, who had borrowed it for fun. Fan was the former commander and had a subordinate relationship, so he had to lend it. Later, a brother told me that the gun had been sold, and I had repeatedly asked for it without success, and now the incident has occurred, etc. The former battalion commander Fan Zhengshan confessed that he completely denied the matter. Then Liao Zhiyuan and the former secretary confessed that the gun and bullets had been borrowed. As a result, about 1,000 people were taken into custody, awaiting submission to the province for review.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Boat Encountered Robbery En Route</h3>
<p>In the area of Sanliqiao, Beitang, the second district, three vegetable boats from the southern countryside were moored before and after (12th). At the third watch of the night, two boats rowed from the south. Suddenly, five or six strong men appeared, all wielding sharp weapons. They boarded the vegetable boats and tied up the three crew members one by one, gagging their mouths to prevent them from shouting. As a result, 66 silver dollars were robbed, and clothes and quilts were also swept away, and they fled south.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Robbery Occurred in Dongshe Village</p>
<p>Dongshe Village in the second district of this county is located in a remote area with few residents. At about 9:00 PM last night, eight or nine bandits suddenly arrived, holding box guns. They went to Zhou Xinfu's house and broke into the house, tied up Zhou, and pushed him outside the door, preparing to hang him. Fortunately, villagers Tian Guilin and Xu Shunqing heard the alarm and rushed to the scene and repeatedly pleaded with the bandits. As a result, after giving the bandits all the 300 yuan of the hui loan, they were released. At the same time, the bandits took the money and left triumphantly to the south.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Son of Township Chief Forced a Person to Death</p>
<p>The family of Lu Zhou in Xinyu Township, the third district of Qidong, lost more than 2,000 copper coins the day before yesterday, suspected of being stolen by a neighbor, Han Deshun. They reported to Huang Jikang's son, Wenqi, the township chief of the township, who detained Han in a teahouse in Gaojia Town and tortured him to force a confession. Han had no choice but to agree to pay compensation before he was released. But because he was unfairly implicated, he was extremely resentful and developed the idea of ​​ending his life. That night, he committed suicide by taking poison. Yesterday, the corpse's family reported the incident to the county government, and Yang, the trial officer, went to examine the body and confirmed that he had died from taking poison before death. However, there were many scars on his arms and thighs, which were obviously caused by torture. Wenqi was arrested and brought to the county, and after interrogation, he was taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Please the Provincial Departments to Abolish Passenger Tax</h3>
<p>The ports of this county have always been levied by the Joint Collection Office (organized by three organs: the Education Junkuan Property Office, the County Chamber of Commerce), which sent personnel to collect a passenger tax of 340 Wen per passenger, with an annual income of more than 50,000 yuan, to subsidize education, public security, and charity expenses. In recent years, due to mismanagement, abuses have arisen, and the collectors at various ports have overcharged and pocketed the money, arbitrarily harassing passengers, causing travelers to complain incessantly. Now, county residents Pan Wenhuan, Lu Boheng, etc., believe that at this time of abolishing miscellaneous taxes, this kind of tax cannot be allowed to exist. Yesterday (11th), they jointly submitted a request to the provincial government and the civil and financial departments, ordering the abolition of the tax in order to alleviate the people's suffering.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>A Major Fire in Zhanshui Township Spreads to Seven Homes</p>
<p>The home of Chen Qingyuan, a resident of Zhanshui Township, the eighth district in the west of the lake in this county, caught fire at about 1:00 AM last night when he got up to strike a match to get something, accidentally igniting the cotton. Chen tried to put out the fire in vain. In an instant, the fire soared into the sky. Chen cried out for help, and the villagers rushed to put out the fire. However, the fire had become a prairie fire, and the gale was fanning the flames, affecting the six homes of neighbors Chen Guangchang, Zhu, Ju Da, etc. The fire was put out after three hours. All seven houses, more than 40 rooms, and the clothing of each family were burned to ashes. The total loss of each family is estimated to be nearly 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Court Commission Strictly Investigates the Case Against the Former County Magistrate</p>
<p>The case of the former county magistrate of this county, Li Jinfang, who transferred Jiang Tiecheng from Yancheng, was accused. After Li ruled lightly, the victims, Yu Pu, and others, repeatedly accused the provincial government, alleging that County Magistrate Li had received heavy bribes from Jiang and was biased, etc. The provincial government assigned the case to the First Branch of the Qingjiang High Court for trial. The court sent a secretary, Wu Sifeng, to Funing yesterday to conduct a strict investigation. The truth has become clear, and Wu will return to the court tomorrow to report on his mission.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Daytime Robbery in Dafuqing Lane</p>
<p>Yesterday, at 2:10 PM, five robbers suddenly arrived at the home of Mao Chuxian, resident of No. 29 Wangfulou in Dafuqing Lane, Hangzhou City. Each of them carried a handgun. Four stood guard at the door, while one entered the house under the pretext of looking at it, threatening the occupants into silence. On the spot, they robbed a gold bracelet weighing three qian and two gold rings weighing two qian. They left the house and joined the four accomplices guarding the door, then swaggered away. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately telegraphed all branches to dispatch police to encircle and search. The police captured the ringleader, Cao Chunlin, at the intersection of Caishi Bridge and Suyi Lane. They found a handgun and the stolen gold bracelet on his person. He confessed to having five accomplices who had fled in different directions. A rigorous search is underway. It is reported that a female accomplice was also arrested that evening.</p>
<p>Millions in Inheritance: Brothers in Litigation</p>
<p>Wang Yunzhong, the owner of Wang Yuechang Wenji Silk Shop in Hangzhou City, is the richest man in the Hangzhou silk industry. After his grandfather's death, he inherited over a million yuan in assets. Due to business losses of hundreds of thousands of yuan, he mortgaged all the assets to banks such as Shanghai Zhizhong Bank to repay debts without the consent of his younger brother, Wang Deyi. His brother, Deyi, then filed a lawsuit in court to confirm the invalidity of the contract. After the first instance trial ruled against him, he appealed to the High Court. Yesterday, the Civil Second Tribunal held a trial. Representatives Zhang Tao from Zhizhong Bank and Wu Jinqing from Hangzhou Jianye Bank appeared in court, explaining the mortgage process. The plaintiff's lawyers, Mao Yi and Huang Naitong, pointed out discrepancies in the mortgage date and remittance date. The judge, finding the defendant's testimony contradictory, declared the case clear and scheduled the verdict for the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>

A boatwoman was stabbed in the waist, bleeding profusely, and her life may be in danger.</p>

<h3>Soong Tzu-wen, Wu Tieh-cheng, and Yang Hu Return to Shanghai Together Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is About to Close</p>
<p>It is said that the atmosphere of this session is excellent.</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, and Wu Tieh-cheng, Mayor of Shanghai, jointly went to Beijing on the evening of the 9th to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. As the session is about to close, they took the 11 PM express train from Beijing and returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 13th. The train arrived at Yu Ru at 7 AM yesterday. Soong and Wu got off the train at that station and each took their own cars to return to their private residences for rest. According to Wu, the atmosphere of this session was excellent. All members of the Central Executive Committee from various regions, except for those who were truly unable to attend due to important official duties, rushed to Beijing to attend and participate in the discussions. Therefore, the number of attendees was unprecedented in previous sessions. Moreover, all comrades were able to be open and honest, and humbly discuss matters, truly demonstrating a spirit of sincere unity. He did not wait for the closing of the session and returned to Shanghai because of the heavy administrative duties in the city. The newly appointed Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Chaoji, has not yet arrived with him because he still has private matters to attend to, but he will arrive in Shanghai to take office in a day or two. It is also reported that Soong Tzu-wen was exhausted, so he declined to meet with reporters who went to visit him yesterday and has scheduled to meet with reporters from various newspapers at his residence at 11 AM this morning to make a statement.

<h3>Resembling the Terror of the "January 28th" Incident, Japanese Troops Conducted a Major Exercise Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Exercise Area Extended to Honan Road and Nanking Road</p>
<p>An American Reporter Was Arrested for Photography but Released After Negotiations</p>
<p>According to Shenshi News, from 7 AM to 10 AM yesterday morning, 2,500 members of the Japanese Navy Land Forces in the Shanghai area conducted a large-scale exercise. The situation was serious for a time. Residents in the exercise area were extremely frightened because they had not been notified by the Japanese in advance. Alexander H. Bachman, a reporter for the English-language China Press, was arrested by the Japanese army for taking pictures, but was released after negotiations. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Early Morning Exercise Like Facing a Major Enemy</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops participating in the exercise totaled more than 2,500. At around 7 AM, under the leadership of Rear Admiral Araki, the new commander of the Naval Land Forces, they assembled in the Jiangwan military camp and then moved out in the direction of North Szechuan Road and Honan Road. For a time, tank teams, machine gun patrol teams, and communications teams were all mobilized, as if facing a major enemy. The situation in the area from Hongkou Park to Szechuan Road was the most serious. Japanese sentries were scattered everywhere, like a replay of the terrifying scene of the "January 28th" incident.</p>
<h3>Expanded Area, Serious Situation</h3>
<p>The situation of the Japanese exercise yesterday was more serious than usual. The exercise area yesterday had broken through its previous exercise area. In the past, the exercise area of the Japanese troops in Shanghai only reached north of Yokohoma Road on North Szechuan Road. Yesterday, the area was expanded to the south of Suzhou Creek and to the central area of the Public Concession, such as Honan Road and Nanking Road. The exercise targeted this central area as the target of attack. The exercise lasted from 6:40 AM to 11 AM, a total of five hours.</p>
<h3>Residents Not Notified, Alarmed</h3>
<p>The Japanese army suddenly conducted a large-scale exercise yesterday without notifying our Public Security Bureau and other departments in advance. Therefore, after the exercise began, the people in the area of the road built beyond the boundary of North Szechuan Road were confused and panicked. In addition, the residents in the Public Concession also felt alarmed because the exercise was unusual. The Public Concession police authorities temporarily dispatched a large number of detectives and other personnel to maintain order on the main roads. Therefore, there were no major obstacles to traffic.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Detained for Photography</h3>
<p>When the Japanese army was in the midst of the exercise, Alexander H. Bachman, a reporter from the China Press, brought a camera and took news photos at the gate of the Jiangwan military camp. The Japanese army intervened and ordered him to hand over the film he had taken. Bachman refused to hand over the film, arguing that it was customary to take news photos of military exercises by the armed forces of various countries in Shanghai. As a result, he was detained by the Japanese army. Later, the China Press authorities, the US Consulate, and the US Army Command sent personnel to negotiate. As a result, he handed over the film and was safely released at around 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiande Bank to Convene Meeting of Creditors</h3>
<p>To Be Held at the Old YMCA on the 17th</p>

A temporary shareholders' meeting will be convened at the Lixin Accounting Firm on the 29th of this month to discuss the procedures to be followed. It is learned that the bank's board of directors is concerned that the depositors and creditors may not be aware of the bank's financial situation, or that they may be impatient. Therefore, it has entrusted accountant Pan Xulun and lawyers Cai and Qu to convene a meeting of the bank's creditors to report on the bank's current financial situation and announce the proper liquidation procedures so that creditors can understand the facts and not panic too much. The announcement by accountant Pan and others is reproduced below: The board of directors of Jiande Bank has stated that since the bank suspended business, the creditors have been very concerned because they are not aware of the bank's financial situation. In addition to scheduling a temporary shareholders' meeting to discuss the procedures to be followed, we have been requested to convene a meeting of the bank's creditors in advance to report on the bank's financial situation and discuss liquidation procedures.

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Communications to Improve Parcel Delivery Methods</h3>
<p>Promptly Order the Post Office to Improve</p>
<p>To Facilitate the Circulation of Commercial Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, (the title is omitted). On the 13th of this month, we received a letter from the Lace Embroidery Association stating that "our embroidery and drawn work are mostly shipped in and out by post, which is closely related to the postal service. Recently, when members of our association go to the Shanghai Postal Administration to mail parcels, they often have to wait all day to complete the mailing procedures. They have to take the goods back home in the evening and go back to mail them the next day, and the congestion is the same as before. They even have to send personnel to guard the goods and take turns eating. In this situation, the members are suffering, and the loss in economic manpower is huge. Or because it is difficult to mail, they transfer to ships, which is not only inconvenient for the industry, but also affects the revenue of the post office. It is found that in the past, the parcel mailing department of the post office had separate columns for domestic, foreign, Chinese, and English. Recently, they have been mixed together, and the number of personnel in charge has been further reduced, resulting in stagnation. It is urgent to ask the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to directly write to the Postal Administration to improve the situation as soon as possible to avoid inconvenience." In view of the fact that the postal service is stagnant, it is indeed difficult for stores that mail many parcels, and it is not the original intention of the country's direct mail. It is appropriate to ask the General Assembly to approve a letter to the Postal Administration to improve the situation as soon as possible to facilitate commercial transportation. The Ministry has made great efforts to organize the telecommunications, which are under its jurisdiction, in recent years, with the convenience of business as the main goal, and has gradually achieved results. The postal service is the same, and the delivery of goods packages should be fast. According to the situation described by the association, there is a situation where they have to wait all day and fail to mail the package, and they have to send personnel to guard the bureau every day. This situation is making businessmen suffer endlessly. It is reasonable to telegraph the Ministry for review and approval, and to promptly order the bureau to properly plan to improve the parcel collection and delivery methods, so as to facilitate the circulation of commercial goods, and we are eagerly awaiting orders. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows. First,</p>

<h3>Two Abandoned Steamships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>The Jiahe Abandoned and Out of Service</p>
<p>Guangji to be Re-bid</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe steamship, which used to sail to Wenzhou and Xiamen, has been out of service on overseas routes since being robbed by pirates. It was dispatched to Yichang and Shashi for temporary use. Now that the task is completed and it has returned to Shanghai, the company has sealed the ship. Due to the ship's age and high coal consumption, adding anti-piracy equipment is deemed uneconomical. After the ship department's assessment, it has been decided to officially decommission the ship and abandon its service. The matter has been reported to the Ministry for record. It is said that the company plans to estimate the ship's value and then sell it through bidding. Also, the previously decommissioned Guangji steamship, after the company advertised for bids, set a selling price of 50,000 yuan. Surprisingly, no one submitted a bid. This has been brought up for discussion at the board of directors, and General Manager Liu has been instructed to re-evaluate the price and re-advertise for bids.</p>

<h3>Report on the Red Swastika Society's Investigation of the Disaster Situation in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province has suffered from disasters for years, leaving it devastated. Although order has gradually been restored, the disaster victims are displaced and extremely pitiful. Moreover, this summer has brought repeated floods and droughts to over 60 counties. At this time of severe cold, with no clothes, no food, and no shelter, the urgency of relief is more critical than fire. In view of this, the General Association of the Red Swastika Society has jointly organized disaster relief efforts in Jiangxi Province and publicly elected President Han Shichang (of Fuhang) to go to Jiangxi to investigate the disaster situation. It was reported yesterday that Mr. Han has completed his investigation and returned to Shanghai, reporting that the disaster situation is extremely dire. It is heart-wrenching to read. Therefore, we have selected excerpts below, hoping that all sectors of society will generously show compassion and work together to provide relief. (Omitted above) This month, on the 4th, I took a boat west and arrived in Nanchang on the 6th. I met with Xiong, the Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, to inquire about the general situation of the disaster in Jiangxi. I also explained the Society's intention to form a team to go to Jiangxi for relief and requested the Provincial government to provide the Society with convenience in transportation and other aspects of relief. The Chairman accepted fully, expressed welcome, and consulted with Chairman Lu Zhuqing of the Relief Affairs Association. He agreed to arrange for the free transportation of relief goods on the Nanxun Railway and the Jiangxi disaster area highways, as well as along the Yangtze River. Immediately, I set out to investigate the disaster area. Fortunately, the highways are closely connected, like a spider web, and travel is not difficult. I will now report on my findings separately. (1) Disaster areas: In eastern Jiangxi, areas such as Yiyang, Shangrao, Hengfeng, Fuliang, Dexing, Leping, Qianshan, and Guixi have suffered severely. In western and southern Jiangxi, several counties such as Cihua, Yanxi, Tengtian, and Yongfeng, designated as special political districts, have also suffered severely. The newly recovered disaster areas in southern Jiangxi, such as Ningdu, Xingguo, Yudu, Huichang, Ruijin, Shicheng, and Guangchang counties, are particularly dire. (2) The tragic situation in the disaster areas: In all disaster areas, houses have been destroyed, and people are displaced along the roads. After the great disaster, compounded by a year of famine, the disaster victims have no clothes or food and are suffering from hunger and cold. The situation is unbearable to witness. In the recovered areas, corpses are scattered everywhere. Even when buried, they are only lightly covered with soil. The sun and rain cause blood to seep into the ditches, leading to the spread of epidemic diseases that cannot be controlled. Many disaster victims suffer from abdominal distension and cannot defecate, or cannot speak, or have acute typhoid fever, or dysentery and malaria. They groan on the roads, with no one to treat them, and wait to die. Alas, our compatriots, if they do not die from the disaster, they die from the epidemic. It is truly a great catastrophe. (3) Needed relief goods: The climate in Jiangxi Province is colder than in other parts of the Yangtze River, and the disaster victims urgently need warm clothing. Food is secondary. Medicine is even more urgent. Disaster victims with no homes are sleeping on the ground under the sky and should be sheltered. The work of burying corpses cannot be delayed. More laborers should be hired, and experienced burial team members should be selected to carry out the work. (4) Transportation overview: Of the disaster areas listed above, except for Cihua, Yanxi, Yudu, Huichang, Ruijin, and Shicheng, where the roads have not been completed and Ningdu is under construction and will be open by the end of the year, all other counties have highways, and cars can easily arrive from morning to evening. The Society's relief team has been organized and must bring more clothing, food, and medicine for relief. Starting one day earlier means saving some lives sooner. Knowing that the Society's resources are weak and that expanding relief efforts is beyond our means, we sincerely hope to raise awareness widely, arouse the sympathy of all sectors of society, and raise funds for relief to alleviate the suffering. We cannot express our gratitude enough.</p>

<h3>Fourteen Hats Robbed</h3>
<p>Liu Wuchang, a Shaoxing native, and Chen Xiaoguanzi, from Jiangbei, well-known criminals who rob copper basin felt hats, boarded the No. 9 public bus near Yuanfang Road on Broadway at 3:45 p.m. on the 8th of this month and robbed a passenger, Wang Renzhi, of a copper basin hat worth fifteen yuan. They attempted to escape, but were spotted by Chinese detectives Zhang Xuchang and Zhang Faxiang, who helped capture the two criminals. They were taken to the Hongkou Police Department and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan came to the Third Criminal Court for further trial. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that after investigation, it was found that the two defendants had robbed passengers of dozens of felt hats on trams, public buses, and rickshaws on Broadway, Huaji Road, Zhaofeng Road, and Xihuade Road. They have been recovered from various pawnshops, totaling fourteen hats. However, the victims cannot be found. He requested that major newspapers publish this information so that they can be identified at the police department.

<h3>The Yu Tai-tai Case Adjourned Again</h3>
<p>Yu Tai-tai, the owner of the Yu Baoshan Hall, a Cantonese woman residing at No. 64 West Ames Road in the French Concession, was kidnapped on the morning of October 21st at 8 a.m. while going to Mass at the Catholic Church and hidden. A ransom of 300,000 yuan was demanded for her release. On the 19th of last month, French police detectives arrested six kidnappers in Shanghai and Suzhou: Li Chunxiao, Wang Fukang, Zhang Huizhi, Zhou Juqin (female), Lin De, and Tao Shuigen, all from Shaoxing. Lin and Tao were injured in a shootout and sent to the hospital for treatment. The police sent the other four criminals, including Li, to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Later, Tao Shuigen died of his injuries. On the 5th of this month, Judge Xiong Huiping opened the court for a trial. Because the victim, Yu Tai-tai, was frightened and ill and still in the hospital for treatment, the police requested a postponement. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday was another scheduled hearing date. Yuan Jiahong, the police lawyer, reported that the criminal Lin De had not recovered from his injuries, and the victim was still in the hospital for treatment. The police were unable to proceed with the investigation and requested another two-week adjournment for questioning. After questioning the defendants briefly, the judge ordered the trial to be adjourned to the 28th. The defendants remained in custody.</p>
<h3>Monk Loan Dispute Concluded</h3>
<p>The abbot of Longhua Temple, Monk Xingkong, borrowed 500 yuan from Monk Fangcheng of the same temple for expenses. Two IOUs were written, one for 200 yuan and one for 300 yuan, and guaranteed by three monks, Shuichan, Dafeng, and Liaoyuan. They stipulated an interest rate of one percent and a term of two months. However, since the loan was taken, it has not been repaid. Despite repeated demands, only 50 yuan in interest has been received. Recently, Fangcheng, lacking any other recourse, hired Peng Xuehai as his lawyer to apply to the local court for mediation and demand the return of the principal and interest, totaling over 500 yuan. This has been reported previously. It is now known that the case failed to be mediated and has been formally prosecuted. The defendant, Xingkong, hired Pan Zhensheng as his lawyer for the defense. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., Judge Hong Xiheng summoned the parties for trial. Neither party reported to the court, and both were represented by their lawyers. The judge asked why neither party had appeared. Lawyer Peng replied that since Fangcheng became involved in the lawsuit, it has been difficult for him to stay in Longhua Temple, so he has left and now has no fixed address. However, he goes to the Water Immortal Temple near Fang Bridge from time to time and is currently in a very distressed state. He requested that the court issue another summons. Lawyer Pan stood up and refuted, stating that an examination of the documents in the box of Yuanzhao in the case file of Prosecutor Wu of the court did not reveal an IOU from Xingkong. The plaintiff should now be asked to produce the IOU before it can be returned. If no evidence is produced, the case should be dismissed. The judge asked why Yongchan and others had not appeared. Pan replied that Shuichan and Liaoyuan had left the temple, while Dafeng had gone to Hangzhou on business, and Xingkong was ill, so they had not appeared. The judge ordered the start of the debate, considered it concluded, and set the date for the verdict to be announced at 2 p.m. on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Cracked Down in Zhangjia Lane</h3>
<p>Recently, local hooligans such as Xiong Jikang secretly opened a gambling den on the overpass near the Sihai Teahouse at No. 93 Zhangjia Lane in Zhabei.

This was discovered by the police in charge of the area, who sent detectives disguised as gamblers to infiltrate the gambling den at 9 p.m. the night before. The detectives saw that the gamblers were enthusiastically placing large bets. At a given signal, they arrested the owner, Xiong Jikang, and the gamblers, Shen Chunlin, Zhang Ahou, Chen Changyuan, Qian Shiqi, Li Baosheng, Meng Awu, and others, totaling 37 people. A copper treasure basin, eight sets of mahjong tiles, and gambling money were also seized and taken to the police station for temporary detention. After questioning each person yesterday, the police, considering the matter a violation of the law, prepared a document and sent the criminals and evidence to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Stolen Check Cashed at HSBC</h3>
<p>Uncle and Nephew Wang Yu Ji Detained</p>
<p>Source of Check Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The Ningbo Xin Haimen wheel was robbed by pirates on the 6th of this month, and many male and female passengers were kidnapped and ransomed for huge sums. Details have been reported in this newspaper. At 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, a Taizhou native, Wang Xingji (35 years old), presented a check for 100 yuan, number 238966, at the Hongkou branch of HSBC Bank at 27 Broadway Road for cashing. The bank staff found that the check was a relief payment from a department of the Zhejiang Sheng Kung Hui Council, which had been reported lost from the robbery, so they detained him and inquired about the source. Wang claimed that his nephew, Wang Wanhe (26 years old), who was waiting outside, had asked him to cash it on his behalf. The bank then telegraphed the Hongkou Police Station, and Chinese detective Wang Guangqi and a Western detective arrived and arrested both Wangs and took them to the police station. It was learned that Wang Yuji lived at 29 Hongfa Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, and worked as a carpenter. The detectives went there with officers from the local police station to search the premises, but found no evidence. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhishan, stated the previous circumstances and requested the court to send a letter to the Ningbo Local Court Procuratorate to investigate the case with the Sheng Kung Hui Council of Zhejiang Province. The two defendants were detained and the case was postponed. The check was presented to the court as evidence and Wang Yuji testified that his cousin, Wang Wanhe, had come to him yesterday afternoon, saying that a woman had given him a 100-yuan HSBC check and asked him to cash it with her husband after he got the money. Wang Wanhe testified that he took the Ningbo Xin Haimen wheel from Hezhou that day at around 2:00 PM, when dozens of pirates suddenly came and robbed the passengers of their belongings. A woman near 30 years old was kidnapped by the pirates, and she gave him the check and left. Later, when the wheel arrived at Haimen, he showed it to a teacher in a restaurant who found that it was a Shanghai HSBC check, so he came to Shanghai and asked his uncle Wang Xingji to cash it together. He hesitated with the rest of his testimony.</p>
<p>Judge Wu Zehan ordered that he be detained again and that the matter be investigated and verified at a later date.</p>
<h3>Girl Picking Up Copper Coin Tragically Crushed to Death by Tram</h3>

<p>Head Crushed Beyond Recognition</p>
<p>Li Zhu, a 37-year-old woman from Suzhou, whose husband had passed away, brought her seven-year-old daughter, Qiaoying, to Shanghai to work as a domestic helper due to poverty.

Yesterday at 11:15 AM, the girl Qiaoying went out alone and was crossing Fada Road from south to north in front of number 276, when a copper coin she was holding fell to the ground and rolled into the tram tracks. As the child stopped and bent down to pick up the coin, a tram number 27 of the French Tram Company, driven by driver Wu Shoubai (34 years old, from Jiangbei), was heading east from the Tilanqiao-Shanzhong Road route. The driver failed to brake in time, and the girl, oblivious, did not retreat, resulting in her being hit. The person was dragged by the tram for three storefronts.

Twenty-four bags of red pills were seized, each bag containing 1,000 pills, totaling 24,000 pills, weighing eleven pounds and fourteen taels, along with a set of smoking paraphernalia. Later, an accomplice, Xu Bosheng, was found in room 528 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road and taken into custody at the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District and prosecuted in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Patrol House, rose to state the case, saying that after the Patrol House learned that someone was privately selling red pills in No. 564 Hongshou Lane, it sent informants to pretend to be customers and bought two bags of red pills from the defendant Ling Liansan, each bag containing a thousand pills, for six yuan and four cents. However, it was found that the defendants' organization for selling the drugs was very strict, and their manufacturing plant was located in Wangjialong, Caojiadu, and was presided over by Zhang Xiangsheng, nicknamed Xiaodongyang. Yesterday, the Patrol House ordered the informants to go to purchase them a second time, and paid 64 yuan, with secret marks on the banknotes, and purchased ten bags of red pills from Ling. The informants were monitored by the two defendants, Zhang and Shen, while Ling and his wife went out to secretly investigate whether there were detectives present. Since no action was seen, they went to No. 570 on the opposite side of the back door, while Shen Yixing rushed to room 528 of the Dongya Hotel to pick up the goods. Xu Bosheng sent twenty-two bags of red pills to No. 570 Hongshou Lane and were arrested by detectives, who searched the red pills and banknotes from each defendant. As for the defendant Liu Zongjie, because he was the second landlord of No. 570, there was a complete set of smoking paraphernalia in his bedroom. At that time, Liu was still asleep, and he was awakened and taken to the Patrol House. After Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession, Ling Liansan was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1,000 yuan for jointly selling opium substitutes, Liu Zongjie was fined 40 yuan for possessing opium smoking paraphernalia, and the other four people, Ling Zhu, etc., were each sentenced to one year in prison and fined 300 yuan each. The smoking paraphernalia and red pills were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Poor Rickshaw Pullers Petition City Party Headquarters for Relief</h3>
<p>Regarding the Detention of Sixty-Four Rickshaw Licenses</p>
<p>The 64 rickshaw licenses owned by the Rickshaw Pullers Association of this city have been leased to poor rickshaw pullers for business since 1928, which has been six years. Now, disputes have arisen between those who are leasing and those who are requesting to transfer the lease. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has stopped issuing licenses since October. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented the situation to the Municipal Government for approval, and the Rickshaw Pullers Association was allowed to send two representatives to attend the meetings. It is still under review. Recently, the rickshaw pullers who rely on this for a living are ordered by the Municipal Public Works Bureau to go to the verification on time on the one hand, and to return the license plates on the other hand, and they are at a loss. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to request relief from the City Party Headquarters. The petition is recorded as follows: For the purpose of stating the hardships of the suspension of business and requesting relief, it is found that in 1928, when the Municipal Public Works Bureau approved 4,500 rickshaws for business in Shanghai South, there were 89 donation licenses donated by Yuan Baotang, and 68 of them had licenses but no cars. The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce and People's Association presented the case to the Shanghai Municipal Government and it was issued to the Rickshaw Pullers Branch, which is now the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association, for management. At that time, the original 5,064 vehicles were reduced to 4,500 according to the 8863 reduction, so the fellow rickshaw puller Zhang Hengfeng had four more vehicles reduced in his name, and the Rickshaw Pullers Association provided four of the 68 vehicles to make up the difference, in order to comply with the principle of public service. The remaining 64 vehicles were leased out successively to compensate for the monthly loss of donation licenses, and were handled by Song Fengming, Yu Yuanjin, Zhang Xianghua, Chen Jichang, Zhu Zhishan, Xu Huangfu, Qi Ronghua, etc., who leased them to people to pull and support themselves, in order to maintain their livelihoods. For several years, there have been no objections from all parties. However, in August of this year, a group of car dealers, in the name of poor rickshaw pullers, submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Works Bureau,</p>
<p>requesting to transfer the lease, resulting in the suspension of the issuance of the 64 rickshaw licenses since October. In this late autumn and early winter, each car supports at least several people to make a living. The Rickshaw Pullers Association has repeatedly requested the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Works Bureau to provide relief, but so far there has been no satisfactory reply. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has instead ordered the people to hand over all 64 license plates, which seems to cut off the lifeline of the poor. The people are panic-stricken and thoughtful, and they always think that the Ministry cares about the people's suffering. These sufferings should be presented as follows: (1) Rural bankruptcy, social depression, unemployed workers, and others rely on pulling cars to make a living. These 64 rickshaw licenses have been suspended for three months. Each car supports a family of several people, and their situation is extremely miserable. In order to relieve the poor and maintain society, please be considerate of the situation and allow the license issuers to operate. (2) When the car users leased the cars in the past, they all mortgaged and tried to prepare a new car, which cost a lot of money. Even during the recent suspension period, the Shanghai South Vehicle Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau ordered them to go to the test on November 20. The cost of replacement and repair is also quite a lot for each vehicle. So repeatedly endure the pain, follow the public order, nothing more than hope to continue to operate and maintain a livelihood. If the inspection is not even half a month, and then suddenly ordered to return the license plate, then the qualified vehicles that have passed the inspection will be abandoned for no reason, which is a pity. It should be requested to give the order to make a request on behalf of the people, and to maintain the livelihoods of the poor. In summary, the words are chosen with urgency. Please ask the Department to review and approve it, and forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Government for approval, so as to avoid hundreds of people who rely on this for a living from becoming starving ghosts. The grace is like re-creation, and the feeling will be immortal. Presented with the utmost gratitude to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, Qiu Chunshan, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association,</p>

<h3>Sugar Production and Sales Cooperative to Be Established</h3>
<p>Resist the Dumping of Foreign Goods</p>
<p>The sugar industry in this city, in view of the dumping of Japanese and Dutch sugar in China over the years, and the fact that domestic sugar manufacturing is technically backward and unable to compete with foreign goods, has lost a considerable amount of money each year. It has now launched a sugar production and sales cooperative, and is now gathering capital. It will be established soon. After the establishment of the cooperative, in addition to cooperating to improve sugar production technology in the domestic sugar production areas, it will also be responsible for underwriting sales in order to resist the dumping of foreign goods.</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Mezzanine, Destroying the Door, and Breaking into the Taxpayers' Association Requests the Public Works Department to Correct</h3>
<p>The Illegal Actions of Western Staff of the Works Department</p>
<p>If It Happens Again, You Can Immediately Hand Over to the Police Station</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession received a letter from Wang Xiaozhai, stating that a Western staff member of the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau, claiming to be investigating mezzanines, broke into the room without permission and dismantled iron locks, etc. The association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau to handle it quickly and stop it. It also sent a letter to Wang Xiaozhai stating that if such a situation occurs again, he can hand it over to the police station. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Bureau: Sirs, according to Wang Xiaozhai's letter, the "mezzanine" case has occurred for a week, and the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau has sent Westerners to inquire about it several times. Last Tuesday, the Westerner came again to inquire whether the mezzanine had been demolished. The manager of the factory replied that the house belonged to the landlord and the residents did not dare to demolish it without authorization. Unexpectedly, today (12th) at 4:45 PM, a Westerner suddenly came again and broke into the factory without the permission of the doorman patrol, and dismantled the iron lock of the factory door. Although the factory staff tried to stop him, it was ineffective. At that time, it was working hours in the factory, and the workers were panicked and dangerous. If an accident occurs, who will be responsible? The Public Works Bureau staff should also hold relevant certificates when entering people's homes on official business. Such personal actions and arbitrary disturbances should be corrected by the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau. The association has received the letter, saying that the Westerner claims to be named Hill and has been there three times. Under the difficult socio-economic conditions of the store, it seeks to reduce the burden and increase income. This is the same for both public and private economies, and the mezzanine is one of the means. However, the officials of your bureau do not follow legal procedures, invade people's homes, and act arbitrarily. Not to mention that it is not allowed by our country's constitution or other laws, even the Great Charter of England considers illegal invasion of homes to be a major event. Not only should the perpetrator be placed in accordance with the law, but if it is a staff member of a government agency, the person in charge is also responsible. Accordingly, the association requests your bureau to promptly correct the staff member and not try again, so as not to leave an indelible disgrace on the institution known for its rule of law. This is addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>Reply to Wang Xiaozhai: Sir, your letter of December 12 regarding the Public Works Department officials of the Public Concession Public Works Bureau illegally invading people's homes has been received. If such a situation occurs again in the future, you can hand it over to the police station for handling in accordance with the law. This association has also requested the bureau to seriously correct the matter. This is a reply to Mr. Wang Xiaozhai.</p>
<h3>Free Rental and Extensive Distribution of New Houses: The Social Bureau Finds Deceptive</h3>
<p>Order the Owner to Come to the Bureau for Questioning</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Municipal Social Bureau, based on a news report of an advertisement for "free rental, extensive distribution of new houses, and awarding of bonuses," examined the content and found it unreasonable. It sent personnel to investigate and reported that the building on Gonghexin Road, North of Yingpan Bridge, Zhabei, was extremely simple and could hardly support for 22 years. According to the articles of association issued by the owner Tao Jianhua, each four-room building is actually a bungalow divided into four parts, which is extremely narrow. Also, the so-called no water fee and free rental of a small vegetable field were investigated and found to be extremely remote, with a well nearby that did not belong to the owner, and no vegetable field, which seemed to refer to the surrounding open space. The various points listed in the articles of association are mostly inconsistent with the facts and are obviously deceptive. After the bureau reviewed and verified that it was true, it ordered Tao Jianhua to come to the bureau to await questioning and sent separate letters to various newspapers prohibiting the publication of the advertisement.</p>
<h3>Refugees from Various Provinces Flee to Shanghai to Beg for Food</h3>
<p>Recently, in the Taiyangmiao Road and North Railway Station areas of Zhabei, there have been disaster-stricken refugees from Hubei and Xianxian County, Hebei, with a small number of fifty or sixty men, women, and children, and a large number of one or two hundred people. Yesterday, there were also refugees from Suzhou County and Mengcheng County, Anhui, temporarily stationed in Jiangwan Town, with about two hundred men and women, who sent representatives to the Social Bureau to request relief. The bureau sent a letter to the Zhabei Charity Group, which immediately sent personnel to distribute rations to the refugees for one or two days in conjunction with the nearby district police. This can be seen frequently, indicating that drought disasters are prevalent in various provinces this year, the disaster situation is severe, and the weather is cold. The refugees are having difficulties in their lives and are coming to Shanghai to beg for food. It is feared that more will continue to come.</p>

<h3>Animal Protection Society Requests Prohibition of Releasing Animals at the Nine-Bend Bridge</h3>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Police Bureau Requesting Investigation and Prohibition</p>
<p>The China Animal Protection Society, in order to protect aquatic life and safeguard public health, yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau requesting the investigation and prohibition of the release of any fish into the pond under the Nine-Bend Bridge at the City God Temple. The letter stated: "We respectfully inform you that the act of releasing animals is a traditional virtue in our country, beneficial to society, and not to be taken lightly. The pond under the Nine-Bend Bridge at the City God Temple in our city has long been a place where people release animals. However, the water quality in the pond is unclean, which endangers aquatic life. Furthermore, every hot summer, the polluted water emanates a stench, causing fish to die one after another, which contradicts the purpose of releasing animals and is also detrimental to public health. We propose that your bureau issue a prohibition against placing any aquatic animals in the pond. Those who wish to release animals can entrust them to charitable organizations to be released in suitable locations, so as to value life. Except for the existing fish, which our society will find a way to relocate and care for, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly." It is also learned that the Society has appointed all faculty and students of the Veterinary Department of the China Vocational Education Society as honorary veterinarians yesterday.</p>

<h3>Continuing to Capture Accomplices in the Assassination of Tang Jiapeng</h3>
<p>Suspect Confesses That Wang Xinggao Participated in the Crime</p>
<p>French Police Detectives Make Arrest at Central Hotel</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, a native of Ningbo and also known as A Yu, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was assassinated on June 18th of last year at 1:30 AM. After finishing work at the Great World, he was walking home when, just as he stepped into his car outside the entrance, he was attacked by several thugs instigated by his enemies, who opened fire, killing him on the spot. At the same time, a passerby, Wu Guangcai from Yangzhou, was also fatally struck by a stray bullet. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign detectives from the special unit of the French Police successively apprehended the perpetrators Zhang Xiaosizi (from Funing) and Zhao Guangfu (from Yangzhou). They recovered a pistol, the murder weapon, and handed them over to the Second Special Court for trial. Zhao Guangfu was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhang Xiaosizi was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, both with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The two criminals appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, but the original verdict was upheld. The two criminals remained dissatisfied and are currently appealing to the Supreme Court for a third trial. The case has been ongoing for over a year and a half. Recently, the Second Detective Division of the French Police, led by Western Inspector General 郎伯樂, based on the confession of the apprehended criminal Zhao Guangfu, discovered that Wang Xinggao, also known as Wang Qinggao and Xiaogao, was involved in the murder of Tang. On the evening of the previous day, they learned that Wang was in Room 537 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. They immediately led detectives Wang Rusong and Guo Shaorong, together with Chinese and foreign police officers from the Lao Zha Police Station, to Room 537 of the Central Hotel at 11:00 PM that night, where they apprehended Wang and brought him to justice. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Xiong Huiping and Clerk Tao Zongkan presided over the first criminal court for interrogation. According to Wang's statement, he is 39 years old, from Funing, residing at No. 46 Mongolian Road, Zhabei, and has been working in political circles. He has no prior criminal record. At this point, Yuan Jiahong, the police lawyer, stated the case, briefly saying that the defendant was involved in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. The police arrested the defendant on Guangdong Road at 11:00 PM on the 13th. As the police investigation is not yet concluded, it is requested that a four-day extension be granted to detain the defendant pending clarification of the case and prosecution. The judge then asked Wang if he knew Zhao Guangfu. He replied, "No." The judge asked, "Do you know about the murder of Tang Jiapeng?" He replied, "No." The judge asked, "According to Zhao Guangfu, who was apprehended in the Tang murder case, you also participated in this case." He replied, "No." He asked when Tang Jiapeng was killed. The judge said, "The police's detailed files have not been delivered, so it is not yet clear." Wang further stated that he served as the director of the Public Security Bureau in Hubei during the 17th and 18th years of the Republic and as the warden of the First Prison in Wuchang in the 21st year of the Republic. He recently took leave to come to Shanghai and is currently working for the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau. At this point, the court ordered a postponement to the 19th for further investigation. The defendant was remanded to custody.</p>

<h3>Opium Addicted Paupers in Winter Shelters Will Be Sent to Drug Rehabilitation Centers for Treatment</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Charity Organization Federation established the Shanghai South Temporary Winter Shelter at the Chaozhou Guild Hall in the South Railway Station on the first of this month, it has been sheltering more than 800 paupers and unemployed workers in recent days, which is overcrowded. If the weather is severe, it will inevitably increase further, so it is planned to set up a second winter shelter in the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road to continue to accommodate as many people as possible. It is learned that the number of people sheltered this year is even more than in previous years, and many of the paupers are addicted to opium. It is said that among the paupers sheltered in previous years who had opium addiction, the charity hospitals in the city provided opium withdrawal pills free of charge to alleviate their addiction and gradually quit. Therefore, starting yesterday, in addition to recording the names of paupers with opium addiction in detail during the daily registration at the winter shelter, a list of those who have already been sheltered with opium addiction will also be compiled and sent to the Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center, requesting them to send personnel to the shelter for diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A Poor Girl Can't Be Ashamed; It Is Right to Treat Western Teachers Equally. Why Should One Be Vainly Humble?</p>
<p>Yueying didn't recognize what kind of silk this was, but seeing the color was so bright and the patterns were so delicate, it must be silk. Even the two pillows on the head were unlike anything she had ever seen. These were rectangular, with a slight bulge in the middle. The usual blue cloth pillows she had seen were always dark and greasy. Only this one was white with not a speck of dust. Moreover, the bed faintly exuded a fragrance. Rich people enjoy themselves like this. This is something that people in the countryside cannot imagine. If there really are gods in heaven, the blessings enjoyed by gods would only be like this, right? She was thinking here, and couldn't help but imagine the gods. She looked at the bed and became somewhat lost in thought. Jia Duocai initially didn't pay attention, and was still pacing back and forth. In the silence of the three people not speaking, after two or three minutes of silence, he happened to pay attention to Yueying, and saw this. A girl paying attention to a man's bed, it seems that there is no need to study how, you can know why, so he is not how to disturb him, just smile. It was Hu Saozi, who was sitting on the side, after a long period of consideration, was somewhat unable to bear it, and coughed lightly twice. But this cough was not from the throat, but from the mouth, which also shows that it was extremely reluctant and unnatural, but Jia Duocai understood his intention, which was to speak, to let him know first, so he turned his head and looked at him. Hu Saozi smiled and said, "Master Jia," saying this, he coughed twice again. Jia Duocai said, "There are only three of us here, if you have something to say, just say it." Hu Saozi stood up, sat down again, and then smiled, "You just look at how gentle this girl is, she really comes from the west, you don't see many like this in Xi'an City. If you favor her, it will not only save her whole family, but also save me. Her family of three lives in my house, I really can't stand it." (90)</p>
<h3>New Secret of Love</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>From the general rule of animals, the male is usually more beautiful or stronger than the female, saying that this is because the male can win the female's favor. In fact, the male has a request for the female. If he can't win the female's favor, brute force will certainly not complete the "transaction." Therefore, the male must be more beautiful, especially stronger, than the female!</p>
<p>Humans are also animals, of course. But now the "civilized world" is upside down. Women are mostly born with monstrous shapes and wear sensual and fragrant clothes. But men are not weak either, and can still dress up in a magnificent and radiant way. That's what you call "matching"! That's enough to qualify for pursuit between the sexes!</p>
<p>But the young people who are now emphasizing love seem to only pay attention to the beauty of the exterior, such as oily hair, powdered faces, and Western suits, and don't pay much attention to the beautification of names. The other day, a friend introduced me to a youth who was utterly beautiful, but all of his beauty was ruined by his name. It turned out that his surname was Fan and his given name was Tong. I was very surprised at the time, how could such a beautiful young man have such an unattractive name!</p>
<p>In the past, Mi Nangong had a daughter who was both talented and beautiful, because he had a kind of "cleanliness" all his life, and always said that the men in the world were mostly very dirty and could not match his daughter! So he was extremely strict in choosing a son-in-law. Later, he met a young man and was surprised by his outstanding demeanor and delighted by his conversation! When he asked his surname and given name, it was Duan Fu, with the style name Quchen. The old gentleman clapped his hands and said, "Since he sweeps away and removes the dust, he is truly my son-in-law." Then he married his daughter to him. If that young man's surname was "Duan" and his given name was "Ming," then a "great event" would have been missed!</p>
<p>Does the world have anyone who wants to get a wife who is both talented and beautiful? Then, in addition to Western suits, although it is said that "thieves do not change their surnames," names must always be strived to be "beautified"!</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Chen Yun'an)</p>
<p>After the net was cast that night, the men and women in the city began to mobilize like an army.</p>
<p>When there are books to read, they don't read them, but when there are no books to read, they desperately want to read them. What a contradictory psychology!</p>
<h3>Hairnet</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>This newspaper's local news once carried a message that "Westerners Welcome Our Country's Hairnets," which roughly stated that the Roman Blanc Company of this country had sent a letter entrusting the International Trade Bureau to introduce their products. This made me think of the millions of hairnets I saw in Jinan, Shandong, twenty years ago.</p>
<p>In the autumn and winter of that year, a foreign firm in Jinan needed a large number of hairnets, so the Chinese manager also engaged in this business. On the one hand, he entrusted so-called brokers to collect goods, and on the other hand, he also set up purchasing stations in Changluan and other places. The foreign firm also established a special department to manage the receipt and inspection of goods. This shows that hairnets were indeed welcomed by Westerners. At that time, at the entrance of the foreign firm, one could see batches of hairnets being carried in on shoulders and backs. After inspection and delivery, one could see batches of them being packed into parcels and sent to the post office for mailing to various countries. It was very lively. At the same time, in Yantai, foreigners were also specially collecting hairnets there, and the liveliness was no less than in Jinan.</p>
<p>The style of hairnets is mostly round, and the color is mostly black. Although they have different sizes, the dimensions are all regulated. Knitting a hairnet, in the eyes of us laymen, seems very troublesome. The thin net must be stacked in 140 layers to form a complete hairnet. For ease of inspection, every twelve layers are stacked into a group, so a hairnet can also be called "one gross," that is, One gross.</p>
<p>After the hairnets were handed over to the foreigners by the Chinese manager, they began to inspect them. A room was opened in the firm, specially hiring many workers (both male and female) to manage this matter. The inspection standards were whether the quality of the goods was up to standard, in other words, whether the texture was good, whether the material was reduced, that is, whether it was "one gross," whether the color was the same, because hairnets were not only black, but also brown, purple, yellow, and even white. If a hairnet was mixed with miscellaneous colors, it would be unqualified. And whether there were breaks in the mesh. In this case, if there were minor problems, female workers would repair them, otherwise they would be returned.</p>
<p>Due to the above-mentioned reasons, and because market prices also fluctuated, it was not easy for the Chinese manager, even if he was experienced, to earn the foreigners' money!</p>

<h3>Facial Makeup</h3>
<p>— Chifo</p>
<p>People's hearts are different, just like their faces. Millions of people have millions of faces. Even identical twin sisters and brothers are not as similar as brothers in the Zhonglang. Then, how easy is it to write "facial makeup"?</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, you can still write out a few "facial makeup." The rounded contours of the face are mostly wealthy merchants and high officials. The sharp-angled and thin contours, with fluffy hair on the upper part and sparse beard on the lower part, are either artists or bums. What about the "pretty boy" with clear eyebrows and beautiful eyes, the "villainous face" with a thievish head and thievish brain, the "arrogant face" with an imperious and swaying posture, the "flattering face" with honeyed words and ingratiating expressions, the "crab shell face" with crane hair and chicken skin, and the "widow's face" with ice and jade purity... Aren't these certain "facial makeup"?</p>
<p>Mr. Decoppet, the French novelist who claimed that he could tell a woman's nationality by kissing her with his eyes closed, said, "The facial contours of women in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are often similar to round pancakes, and the zygomatic area expands particularly wide. If you add a flat nose, it becomes a 'collapsed pancake.' The characteristics expressed by this type of face are honesty, loyalty, lack of wisdom and skill, and inability to conquer men. Another type is what the Chinese call the 'melon seed face,' which is also characterized by the outward expansion of the cheekbones, with the cheeks gradually narrowing downwards, forming a triangle for the entire face. The characteristics expressed by this type of face are not cleverness or dignity, but frivolity and superficiality." Whether that novelist's evaluation of the facial features of women in our country is reasonable or not, the "facial makeup" of women has been described by him in a vivid and incisive manner.</p>
<p>Whether a person's face is related to their fortune and misfortune, I don't believe it. But there is indeed some attention paid to personality. Therefore, the "facial makeup" in Peking opera is a symbol of this person's personality. The clown is the "little flower," the big face is the "big flower," and the more white powder that is drawn, the more unbearable the person is. The red and black face is either a reckless man or a thief. A person doesn't need to wear a "mask," and they will unconsciously put on a face. A nose full of flowers, a face full of white, eyes with red makeup, a forehead with black makeup, and cheeks with green makeup are all clearly seen by others!</p>

<h3>Scientific Polish President</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Among the current presidents of various countries, there are writers, jurists, and educators. However, the person who holds the administrative power of a country with the title of a world-class scientist is none other than Polish President Mościcki. Although former U.S. President Hoover was originally a mining engineer and once worked for the Kailan Mining Administration in our country, he did not engage in the mining industry after entering politics. This is different from Mościcki, who continues to diligently study science. This month, the 7th marks the 30th anniversary of Mościcki's successful invention in chemistry. The China Science Society, the Chinese Arts and Sciences Society, and the Scientific Movement Association in this city have all sent letters and telegrams of congratulations. Minister of Education Wang Shijie also sent a telegram through Wei Dentao, the envoy to Poland, to congratulate him, which is enough to prove Mościcki's great achievements in the scientific community. Mościcki is currently 67 years old, born in 1867. He first studied in Warsaw, then entered the Riga Industrial Polytechnic, where he topped the school. After graduation, he joined a political group organized by patriotic people, appealing and advocating for the restoration of Poland's independent regime under Russian violent control. Therefore, Mościcki's actions gradually attracted the attention of the Russian government, and he was eventually forced into exile. He first went to London and served as the director of a chemical laboratory. In London, he met General Piłsudski, another Polish political exile. They shared the same ideals and gradually became close friends, and the success of the Polish independence movement was conceived here. Mościcki is a chemist. Through diligent and continuous research, he has gained honors in various countries. The University of Fribourg in Switzerland then hired him as a professor, where he invented nitric acid and other substances. In 1912, Mościcki became a professor at the University of Lviv in Poland, where he made a major invention of a special type of battery, which greatly advanced radio broadcasting, and scientists around the world admired him. Today, the most powerful batteries used by the French Radio Station in Paris are engraved with Mościcki's name. Afterwards, he continued to work hard and delve deeper, and he made new inventions in various substances such as petroleum, nitric acid, and aluminum. After the war, Poland regained its independence. Mościcki served as the general manager of a large factory that manufactures nitric acid and other substances in the region. His business grew day by day. In 1926, Mościcki was elected president of Poland with the most votes in the parliament. During his term, Mościcki's selfless personality influenced his political enemies. In 1933, when his term expired, he was re-elected with the most votes. Although Mościcki is an administrative leader, he still continues his chemical research in his spare time. Although he is old, his spirit is excellent, and he is a worthy role model for the youth of our country.</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance from the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In addition, there were two large glass boxes collecting various toys that the Tongzhi Emperor had played with... small bows, small arrows, clay figures, wooden horses, diabolo, and the like, almost everything... but they were all very ordinary, with no special features. After we looked at them, we were all very disappointed. We didn't expect that the toys of a young emperor were only equal to the gifts we had when we were young. However, we finally discovered something more extraordinary, which was a small clay rabbit... the outside was coated with very shiny white lacquer, the shape was also very vividly sculpted, and there were two bright red eyeballs, which made people love it at first sight. The Empress Dowager seemed to be looking for it there too. As soon as she found it, she concentrated her gaze on it and didn't move. She stared at it for a full seven or eight minutes before ordering Li Lianying to gently open the box and let her reach in and take out the clay rabbit herself. After she took out the clay rabbit, we truly realized the advantages of this toy... it turned out that it was not only particularly cute in appearance, but also had some small mechanical devices! This mechanism was hidden in its belly, and a short red string was threaded out from its back. People only need to pull this nail string, and its two bright red eyeballs will immediately rotate. At the same time, half of a red tongue will stick out from its mouth... if you keep pulling this red string, then its eyeballs will not stop, and its red tongue will keep sticking out and in. The Empress Dowager knew this mechanism. She pulled the red string a few times, and we almost laughed... but the Empress Dowager didn't look happy at all, and she was even more depressed. She stood there blankly holding this clay rabbit, without saying anything... After a long time, she slowly said... "This was many years ago... he always played with this rabbit." (200)</p>

<h3>Notice from the Chinese Football Committee</h3>
<p>(1) The Chinese Football Committee announced that the purpose of the competition is to improve skills and connect friendships. Victory or defeat is secondary. Venting anger and using force is the behavior of fools and vulgar people, and it is not appropriate for the intellectual class to do this. The result is only to hurt feelings.</p>
<p>The referee is the arbiter in the competition, and the players should absolutely respect his authority, obey his orders, and must not resist or blame him.</p>
<p>This committee attaches great importance to the above two points in order to maintain the spirit of the club. If any discovery is made, it will be severely punished without any leniency. I hope the members will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(2) Sun Zhichao, a player of the Donghua team, used force in this game and despised the referee. His competition qualification was revoked.</p>
<p>(3) Huang Luzhi, a player of the British American Tobacco team, used force in this game and was suspended from the next two games.</p>
<p>(4) Due to internal problems in the Lingnan team, most of the players have now withdrawn from the team and requested to add the number of people to avoid interrupting the competition. Approved. (5) The third group cup rematch between Donghua and British American Tobacco will be held next Sunday.</p>
<p>(Announcement) The match between Weihua and Beicheng tomorrow will be changed to 3 pm and will still be held at the original venue.</p>
<h3>連得標準杯及保持江南十年錦標之復旦大學排球隊　　兩分慘敗</h3>
<p>The Fudan University volleyball team, which had won the Standard Cup and held the Jiangnan Ten-Year Championship, suffered a narrow defeat by two points.</p>

<p>In the second half, Zhang Zhaolin's throws and free throws were all on target, no matter the distance, with miraculous accuracy. In an instant, the score was chased to 30-27, and then to 32-31. Both sides committed numerous fouls, and several players were penalized. In the last five minutes, the score was 44-41, and the competition became even fiercer. The gymnasium was filled with cheers, and the Chinese and Western spectators cheered each other on. The referee let out a long whistle, and Mailing won by only two points, with a score of 47-45.

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Athletic Referees Association, established for several years, has achieved remarkable results. Its members work tirelessly and selflessly for the sports community, earning sympathy from all parties. Although competition disputes have not been eliminated in recent years, they have been greatly reduced compared to the past, which is all due to the association's efforts over the years. Now, the association's founders, Le Xiurong, Jiang Xiangqing, Wu Bangwei, Xu Zhendong, Zhang Guoxun, Shu Hong, Feng Jianwei, and others, except for Mr. Le, have either served in other locations or are tied down by their duties, and most of them can no longer serve the association. Since many of the basic members have left, there is a lack of talent. Fortunately, President Le Xiurong is enthusiastic about association affairs and his spirit has been consistent. With the efforts and support of Zhou Jiaqi, He Chunhui, Shen Huichun, Chen Jixiang, and others, there is currently no shortage of talent. However, Mr. Le, Zhou, and He are getting older, and their energy is limited. In the blink of an eye, they will also have regrets of not being able to do what they want. Therefore, they have been making extra efforts to train new talents in recent years, hoping that the association's future can be greatly developed. The referees recruited this year have achieved good results, especially Mr. Jiang Liangui, who has experience in service. Mr. Jiang is a bachelor of physical education from Zhongda University, decisive, lively, and talented. He has researched all subjects of sports academics. This summer, he was introduced by Hao Gengsheng, a sports supervisor of the Ministry of Education, to serve as a professor at the Dongya Sports College in this city, and also as the director of the department and extracurricular guidance. He has been in office for several months and has been highly valued by the school authorities. Jiang Xiangqing, the dean of the school, also praised him. He is the president of the Zhongda Referees Association and has served as a judge for important football and basketball competitions and finals in Nanjing, and he is competent in all of them. He also has a lot of experience in women's basketball. In addition to having a good foundation in English, Mr. Jiang also has a deep foundation in Chinese, and speaks fluent Mandarin. This kind of talent is urgently needed in the referees association and is a fresh force for the future.</p>

<p>申報無線電週刊最新雙孿五極管  李元慶</p>
<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly: The Latest Twin Pentode by Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>在四極眞空管屏極與簾栅極的中間，加裝一個抑制栅極，（Suppressor　grid)卽爲五極管。此第五極之功用，能避免屏極因衝擊過甚而散射之二次電子。結果，五極管的放大力，便於以大著。現在新式收音機的末級代週率放大，大槪没有不用五極眞空管的。</p>
<p>A pentode is created by adding a suppressor grid between the screen grid and the plate in a tetrode vacuum tube. The function of this fifth electrode is to prevent secondary electrons from being scattered by the plate due to excessive impact. As a result, the amplification power of the pentode is greatly increased. Nowadays, the final-stage power amplification in new radios generally uses pentode vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>最近英國新出二種雙孿五極管，（Twin　Pentode)是將二隻五極管合而爲一的，其功效之偉大，更遠在普通一般五極管之上。第一圖</p>
<p>Recently, two new types of twin pentodes have been released in the UK. They combine two pentodes into one, and their effectiveness is far greater than ordinary pentodes. See Figure 1.</p>
<p>第一種是英國麥氏達（Mazda)廠的出品，眞空管號數爲ＱＰ２４o，底座共有九脚，（見第一圖）絲極電流約爲０．４安培，簾栅極與屏極的電壓均爲Ｉ５０弗打。内部兩個簾栅極，分裝於兩個底脚上，因此，簾栅極上可任意加上不同的電壓，以配合各種的用途。兩屏極之輸出總阻，約爲２０，０００歐姆。屏流總值約爲３．８　安培，輪出電力約爲１．３華脱，輸入變壓器之比率約爲１：８。第二圖</p>
<p>The first type is produced by the British Mazda factory. The vacuum tube number is QP240, and the base has nine pins (see Figure 1). The filament current is approximately 0.4 amps, and the voltage of both the screen grid and the plate is 150 volts. The two internal screen grids are installed on two separate base pins. Therefore, different voltages can be arbitrarily applied to the screen grid to suit various purposes. The total output impedance of the two plates is approximately 20,000 ohms. The total plate current is approximately 3.8 amps, the output power is approximately 1.3 watts, and the ratio of the input transformer is approximately 1:8. See Figure 2.</p>
<p>第二種是馬可尼（Marconi）與亞司令（Osram）廠的出品，眞空管號數爲Ｑp2r。内部搆造大致相同，衹是將二個簾栅極連在一起，以及抑制栅極連在燈絲上，這樣，眞空管的底脚，便减爲七隻。（請參閲第二圖）輸出電力約有二華脱。</p>
<p>The second type is produced by Marconi and Osram. The vacuum tube number is Qp2r. The internal structure is roughly the same, except that the two screen grids are connected together, and the suppressor grid is connected to the filament. In this way, the number of base pins of the vacuum tube is reduced to seven. (Please refer to Figure 2.) The output power is approximately two watts.</p>
<p>上述二種，雙孿五極管，最適宜於“Ｂ”類放大。（“Ｂ”類放大，在英國稱爲静止推挽式。Quiescent　push-pull眞空管號數前冠以ＱＰ二字母，卽係原文之縮寫。）Ａ，Ｂ，Ｃ電源，均可採用電池供給。</p>
<p>The above two types of twin pentodes are most suitable for "B" class amplification. ("B" class amplification is called quiescent push-pull in the UK. The letters QP are prefixed to the vacuum tube number, which is an abbreviation of the original text.) A, B, and C power supplies can all be supplied by batteries.</p>
<p>電壓表自製法  宋劍琴</p>
<p>How to Make a Voltmeter by Song Jianqin</p>
<p>弗打表在無綫電工程中亦是一件不可少的儀器，普通的美貨或德貨非化七八元錢不能到手。故爲經濟和研究方面着想，决意將舊廢聽筒一只改造。費去二晚工夫，纔告成就、成績到亦不差，故敢介紹與同好。圖一圖二</p>
<p>A voltmeter is also an indispensable instrument in radio engineering. Ordinary American or German products cannot be obtained without spending seven or eight yuan. Therefore, for the sake of economy and research, I decided to modify an old, discarded earpiece. It took two evenings of effort to complete, and the results are not bad, so I dare to introduce it to fellow enthusiasts. Figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p>圖一Ａ用名片紙製成的綫圈紙心，尺寸如圖所示，將舊聽筒内二綫球的綫盡繞其上，Ｂ爲薄鐵片剪成，正中用針打一細孔，Ｃ亦可用名片紙剪之，用極薄鋁片更佳，其大端相距一分處亦打一細孔。Ｄ爲針鎈斷，長約三分，二頭鎈成鋒尖。Ｅ用薄銅片剪成。長一時一分，灣成如圖，二端距頭半分處用小洋釘各打一凹穴，愈深愈妙，但不可打穿，次將ＢＣ用膠水粘成十字形，再將Ｄ三分之一穿於兩細孔内膠固，一部手續已畢，次爲較騐指針的平衡重量。其法先將Ｄ之二端夾於Ｅ之二凹穴中，使其相接極鬆，指針轉動自如，而不使其二端脱出凹穴，轉側Ｅ，則指針尖端必因重而下垂，此時用香烟鍚紙一細條，繞粘於其大端，使其平衡爲度，（因指針平衡，則裝就後此表無諭倒側、均不致指針脱離零度，）再用厚紙或膠板一小方如圖二的裝法，先將Ｅ之下邊膠於厚紙上，再將綫圈平置於Ｅ之旁，用紙條壓住二端粘於厚紙上，此時指針之後端正在綫圈之孔心内，須左右移動不生接觸，圖中Ｍ爲舊聽筒中取出之磁石，亦用膠水粘於厚紙下，如圖之位置，此時指針因Ｍ吸Ｂ之二端故必指於某點，Ｐ爲一白紙粘於厚紙上，可依指針的尖端劃一六七十度的弧綫。圖三</p>
<p>Figure 1: A is a coil paper core made of business card paper, with dimensions as shown in the figure. Wind all the wire from the two wire balls inside the old earpiece onto it. B is a thin iron sheet cut with a small hole in the center made with a needle. C can also be cut from business card paper, but it is better to use very thin aluminum. Make a small hole at a distance of one fen from its large end. D is a needle cut off, about three fen long, with both ends sharpened into pointed tips. E is cut from thin copper sheet, one cun and one fen long, bent as shown in the figure. Make a recessed hole with a small nail at each end, half a fen from the head. The deeper the better, but do not pierce through. Next, glue B and C together in a cross shape, then fix one-third of D inside the two small holes with glue. One part of the procedure is complete. Next, test the balance weight of the pointer. The method is to first clamp the two ends of D in the two recessed holes of E, making the contact very loose so that the pointer rotates freely without its two ends coming out of the recessed holes. If you turn E, the tip of the pointer will definitely droop due to gravity. At this time, use a small strip of cigarette tin foil, wrap it around and stick it to its large end to balance it (because the pointer is balanced, the pointer will not leave zero degrees no matter which way this meter is tilted after installation). Then use a small square of thick paper or plastic board as shown in the installation in Figure 2. First, glue the lower side of E to the thick paper, then place the coil flat next to E, press the two ends with paper strips and glue them to the thick paper. At this time, the back end of the pointer is in the center of the coil's hole. It must be moved left and right without contact. M in the figure is a magnet taken from the old earpiece. It is also glued to the bottom of the thick paper, in the position shown in the figure. At this time, the pointer must point to a certain point because M attracts the two ends of B. P is a piece of white paper glued to the thick paper. A 60-70 degree arc line can be drawn according to the tip of the pointer. Figure 3.</p>
<p>圖三</p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>最後的較整手續，借標準弗打表及電壓交換器一只，扁電四節。串連成Ｉ８Ｖ	，如圖三接法。Ａ爲標準表，Ｂ爲自製表，轉動交換器使標準表指一弗打，則自製表所指之處亦卽一弗打，（其原指之處爲零弗打）以鉛筆記之，依此較準完善爲止。此表卽可應用。</p>
<p>For the final calibration procedure, borrow a standard voltmeter and a voltage selector, and four dry batteries. Connect them in series to form 1.8V, as shown in the connection in Figure 3. A is the standard meter, B is the homemade meter. Rotate the selector so that the standard meter points to one volt. Then the position pointed to by the homemade meter is also one volt (the position it originally pointed to is zero volts). Mark it with a pencil and calibrate accordingly until it is perfect. This meter can now be used.</p>
<p>如量知其綫圈之歐姆數，再串一本身九倍之歐姆數之耗阻Ｒ。則可量至十倍弗打數矣。（注··較整時，如指針反動、將二綫頭交換卽可。）</p>
<p>If you know the number of ohms in the coil, connect a resistor R in series that is nine times the number of ohms. Then you can measure up to ten times the number of volts. (Note: During calibration, if the pointer reverses, just exchange the two wires.)</p>
<p>低週率放大交連電路  劉同康</p>
<p>Low Frequency Amplification Coupling Circuit by Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>（甲）變壓器交連</p>
<p>(A) Transformer Coupling</p>
<p>此式交連法爲普通應用最廣者，如圖一所示，惟變壓器之電壓比率不可超出一定限度，不然變壓器初級之廻阻將漸次增大而又富於分佈電容量，卽將發生並聯諧振作用，乃對於諧振週率之左近，放大效能極大，而對於其他週率則否，如是則變壓器升降比率愈高，次級分佈電容最愈大、諧振週率之放大效能則更强、而平均放大之範圍反爲狹窄，故足以使言語音樂之各週率殊難得相等之放大，致發生音所失眞之現象，此卽變壓器交連之缺點。此外如吾人採用四五極管作檢波，以其交流屏阻極大，故屏電路所接電阻亦將增大，以免喪失其放大率，然實際採用變壓器交連後，以其初級之阻力甚小，當然難以保持其固有之一定放大效能。此爲其缺點二。圖一圖二</p>
<p>This type of coupling method is the most widely used, as shown in Figure 1. However, the voltage ratio of the transformer cannot exceed a certain limit. Otherwise, the resistance of the transformer's primary coil will gradually increase and be rich in distributed capacitance, which will cause parallel resonance. The amplification performance is extremely large near the resonant frequency, but not for other frequencies. Thus, the higher the step-up/step-down ratio of the transformer, the larger the secondary distributed capacitance, and the stronger the amplification performance of the resonant frequency, but the average amplification range is narrower. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain equal amplification for the various frequencies of speech and music, resulting in sound distortion. This is the disadvantage of transformer coupling. In addition, if we use a tetrode or pentode for detection, its AC plate resistance is extremely large. Therefore, the resistance connected to the plate circuit will also increase to avoid losing its amplification rate. However, after actually using transformer coupling, its primary resistance is very small, so it is naturally difficult to maintain its inherent constant amplification effect. This is its second disadvantage. Figures 1 and 2.</p>
<p>此式交連法，固有上述之缺點，然其優點亦復不少，品質優良之變壓器，以其諧振現象不甚顯着，故其放大率可不因週率之大小而異，而在一週率帶内之放大效能可絶對均匀，此外因其初級阻力甚小，故可不需極高之乙電供給屏極，此式如應用於三極作檢波時，則以三極管之交流屏阻亦甚小，可使放大率增至最大極限也。且如欲收音機之輸出力强大，亦須採用此式交連法作推挽式放大，如圖二。（待續）</p>
<p>This coupling method has the above-mentioned disadvantages, but it also has many advantages. High-quality transformers have less significant resonance phenomena, so their amplification rate may not vary depending on the size of the frequency, and the amplification performance within a frequency band can be absolutely uniform. In addition, because its primary resistance is very small, it does not require extremely high B voltage to supply the plate. If this type is applied to a triode for detection, the AC plate resistance of the triode is also very small, which can maximize the amplification rate. Moreover, if you want the output power of the radio to be strong, you must also use this type of coupling method for push-pull amplification, as shown in Figure 2. (To be continued)</p>
<p>小經騐不用變壓器的低週率振盪器  李元慶</p>
<p>Small Experiment: A Low-Frequency Oscillator That Does Not Use a Transformer by Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>常用的低週率振盪器，大槪是利用低週率變壓器，時常容易斷綫，拆換修理，頗覺費事，這是牠的缺點。</p>
<p>Commonly used low-frequency oscillators mostly use low-frequency transformers, which are often easily disconnected. Disassembly, replacement, and repair are quite troublesome. This is its disadvantage.</p>
<p>我們知道，再生式收音機是僅能產生高週率振盪的，現在却有方法能使牠產生低週率振盪。我們在繞再生圈的時候，衹要我繞十幾圈就行。使用時加强再生力，至超過某一點時，聽筒中便引起一種狂呌。此種呌聲，週率極高，聽來非常悦耳·，普且牠的響度，也超出普通利用變壓器製成的振盪器之上。如果拿來做電碼練習器，不僅經濟耐用，並且重　和地位，也大爲减少。</p>
<p>We know that regenerative radios can only generate high-frequency oscillations, but now there is a way to make them generate low-frequency oscillations. When we wind the regenerative coil, we only need to wind it a dozen times. When using it, strengthen the regeneration force, and when it exceeds a certain point, a kind of wild cry will be caused in the earpiece. This cry has an extremely high frequency and sounds very pleasant. Moreover, its loudness also exceeds that of ordinary oscillators made using transformers. If you use it as a code practice device, it will not only be economical and durable, but the weight and space will also be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>修理中間週率變壓器之簡法  史古</p>
<p>Simple Method for Repairing Intermediate Frequency Transformers by Shigu</p>
<p>現在外差式收音機盛行，他的收音幾敏和選擇性優良，是最使吾人滿意的。不過無論收音機怎樣好，終不免要損壞。外差式收音機裏，别的東西損壞了尙易配購，唯有中間週率雙壓器，最是困難。他要誘導率大。直流阻力小，潛佈電容量小，地位要小。所以我的一付收音機，因爲他損壞了，修來修去，總是成績不好，最近到亞美公司配些材料，看見有蜂房式的高週率阻流綫圈，因爲他的構造和中週率樓壓器所用的一樣，價錢衹有一元半，就想賈一只去試試，所以揀了一只較大的（十　亨利I0MH，）因爲圈數多些，若太大可以拆去幾圈，拿回去一裝，成績也平平，後來一圈一圈的拆，哈哈！拆到一個時候，成績竟好極了。同志中如果碰到這種困難，請不妨一試。</p>
<p>Superheterodyne radios are now popular. Their sensitivity and selectivity are excellent, which is most satisfying to us. However, no matter how good a radio is, it will inevitably be damaged. In superheterodyne radios, it is easy to buy replacements for other damaged parts, but the intermediate frequency double pressure device is the most difficult. It requires a large inductance, small DC resistance, small distributed capacitance, and small size. Therefore, my radio was damaged, and no matter how I repaired it, the results were always not good. Recently, I went to the Yamei Company to get some materials and saw honeycomb-style high-frequency choke coils. Because its structure is the same as that used by the intermediate frequency transformer, and the price is only one and a half yuan, I wanted to buy one to try. So I chose a larger one (ten Henry, 10MH,) because the number of turns is greater. If it's too big, you can remove a few turns. I took it back and installed it, and the results were mediocre. Later, I removed it turn by turn, haha! When I removed it to a certain point, the results were extremely good. If comrades encounter this kind of difficulty, please try it.</p>

<p>, here you can still find fifteen or sixteen year old girls with bound feet, their hair in a bun, and pierced ears. They see men as emperors, keep their heads down, and would rather weep in secret than dare to say a "no." If you insist on gilding it, then you can find some phrases describing the medieval atmosphere to describe this ancient area, but I really can't do that. For example, in this year of famine, when people are hanging their children one by one on trees, what language can I use to describe it? This year is really too strange. The south is so dry that the land is cracking, but here there is a great flood! When the flood came, it was already late autumn. People squatted on the rooftops, naked, staring blankly at the sky, squatting like that all day and all night, unable to get a sip of hot soup. In a few days, half of the old and the young died. Those who died were thrown into the water. In less than ten days, when the water receded, only young people were left. People buried the bodies of their families that had been soaked in the water, and then desperately searched for grass roots, tender branches, and Guanyin clay to fill their stomachs. Here, perhaps, there are one or two relatively well-off "wealthy families." The masters take special care of the poor, calling in girls who catch their eye. With ten steamed buns, the girls' bodies are lost. The masters are naturally very happy, and even those who receive the buns are still extremely grateful. Men want to go out to find work, but they don't have the strength. A few who risked their lives to try to go out eventually dragged themselves back, thinking, "Even in death, I must die in my hometown," and that's how they ended. For example, "goods collectors" (Note: people who traffic in human beings) from other places take advantage of the disaster, taking away mothers and daughters who catch their eye for five or ten dollars, dressing them in beautiful clothes, taking them to Shanghai, Hankou, and the Northeast, and making them smile, smile, smile... in the street corners at night. That's how people live, and that's how people die. There is never any sun here. Isn't that right? A bloody place like this is even afraid of the sun.</p>
<p>On the Train Zhou Han</p>
<p>Thank you for not seeing me off at the station. If, as I expected, you had actually run to the station early in the morning to see me off, I would have found it even less interesting. Although, unexpectedly, you didn't come to see me off, which made me unhappy. Don't laugh at me. I didn't want you to come to the station to see me off, but I also hoped you would come to see me off. Fortunately, that day, you didn't show up on the platform to see me leave as agreed. Otherwise, you would have been worried and unhappy, and I would have inevitably encountered a lot of trouble. I'm telling you, that day, I had a very particular "polite university professor" accompanying me onto the train and traveling with me. Don't be impatient, let me tell you. That university professor was really interesting. He squeezed into the ticket office, sweating all over, to buy my ticket, almost knocking off his glasses. I saw from afar that they were squeezed off his nose and landed on another man. He immediately became blind and groped wildly on the man, shouting loudly, "My glasses? My glasses?" which made me burst out laughing. On the train, he was practically my servant. As soon as I said, "The weather is really hot," he would immediately pour a cup of tea and offer it to me, gently smiling and advising me to drink tea to quench my thirst, saying that drinking tea would make me feel less hot. When the train arrived at a small station, someone outside the train was calling out to sell something. I didn't understand what he was calling out, so I just asked him. He was afraid I wouldn't buy it, no, he was afraid I wouldn't eat it, so he immediately took out money to buy it. When I saw what he had bought, it was water caltrop, and I didn't want to eat it. He asked me if I wanted to eat it. I said that this thing was not tasty, and he echoed, saying that it was really dirty and not tasty, and immediately threw it out of the train window. At noon, the train attendant was calling out to sell things. I hadn't even thought about eating yet, but he immediately asked me if I wanted to eat a big meal? Fried rice with eggs? I found it funny, but I couldn't laugh out loud, so I had to turn my head and look out the window at the telegraph poles flying by. However, he thought I was unhappy. He hurriedly advised me in a gentle voice, "You should eat something at lunchtime. The train won't arrive in Nanjing until two or three in the afternoon." I was embarrassed to refuse his sincerity, so I simply told him that I just wanted a toast. He immediately shouted loudly to the train attendant, "Bring two toasts." You know I don't like to eat other people's things. When I ate the toast and wanted to pay, his money was delivered to the attendant's hand faster than mine. Naturally, I refused to eat his things. I insisted on paying myself. He was so upset that he almost burst into tears, begging me to let him pay. He said that when a Gentleman and a lady eat together, the Gentleman pays, which is a matter of politeness. There is politeness in a Gentleman, and there is politeness in a lady. I said I didn't believe in those politenesses and insisted on paying. I pleaded with him piteously, saying, "Let me pay next time." The attendant and the people in the train were all paying attention to my dispute with him. They naturally thought that he and I were acquaintances, and maybe even thought that I was someone special to him. In this case, if I were too stubborn, it would naturally be too embarrassing for him and would hurt his Gentleman's heart. So I gave in. Don't be impatient, let me tell you. After this dispute, I said to him peacefully but sternly, "I'm giving you face now, but after I get off the train, I will return the money for the meal to you. You will be sorry if you don't accept it." He hurriedly agreed and praised me for being a noble Lady. He said he admired me very much. When the train arrived at Nanjing Xiaguan Station, I returned the money for the meal to him in full, and he accepted it. Moreover, he understood that I was not a woman who could be tempted by "politeness," so he didn't force me and didn't even call a rickshaw for me, but said "Good bye" and left. You think, how interesting was my trip!</p>

<p>Homeward Bound Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>After taking the train for half a day and the boat for half a day, I finally set foot on the pier of my hometown. At that time, the evening crows were already returning to their nests, and cooking smoke was rising from the chimneys. I carried a suitcase in one hand and a paper lantern I had bought in the other, because I still had to walk more than ten miles of small road to get home. There was no moon or stars that night. After running for a while, it was completely dark. I lit the lantern, and the light only illuminated half a foot of road in front of me. This was a familiar road, and I used to walk it at night without a lantern, but now it felt like walking a strange road. Moreover, because of the fatigue of the journey, carrying things in both hands while hurrying along, I almost stumbled and fell every now and then. Ten miles is nothing for us farmers to walk. If there are two people walking together, it's as if they're just strolling and they'll arrive in an instant. Today, however, it seems like the small road has doubled in length. I already feel a slight sweat on my body. Helpless, I rested for a while in the oxcart shed at the corner of the field, put down my suitcase, hung the paper lantern on the corner of the shed, blew a couple of cool breezes, took out a cigarette from my pocket, and simply lay down on the shed frame, closing my eyes and smoking. At this moment, I can truly say that I feel relaxed and happy. I forgot the urgent summons due to my illness, forgot the difficulties I had encountered on the journey. After smoking one cigarette, I bravely started on my way again. About a mile or two from home, I saw a light flashing in the distance. However, the small roads in the countryside are so winding that the light was sometimes obscured by houses and treetops. The more I wanted to walk faster, the more the light seemed to be far away. My mind recalled the scene when my grandfather passed away. That day was also in the middle of the night. My grandfather took his last breath, and the whole family was in a state of panic. Everything for the funeral had to be purchased in the town. I, my father, and my uncle rushed to the town that night. When we returned, we saw the light at the gate of our house flickering wildly, and tears involuntarily welled up in our eyes... Now I see this same light again. I was urged to return by a letter saying that my father was seriously ill. How could I not think of the same thing? I ran forward, regardless of everything. One of my shoes came off. As I approached the light, I was stopped by a rough voice. When I fixed my eyes, I saw that a police station had been set up at the corner of my field. A policeman in black, holding a gun, blocked my way. I raised my head and saw the lantern hanging and swinging in front of the door. I almost cried. He checked my suitcase and my body, and then asked me in a loud voice, "Why are you running so fast in the middle of the night?" When I heard his hoarse voice, I paid close attention to his face. It turned out to be Fu Sheng, our family's former farmhand. I was afraid I had mistaken him, so I spoke in the local dialect and told him that I had returned from Shanghai to visit my sick father. "Young master, you don't recognize me anymore." Fu Sheng, still the same rough and clumsy fellow, patted me on the shoulder, pulled me into the police station, poured me a cup of tea, and told me that my father's illness had taken a turn for the better. The past two days had been truly terrible. He had been unable to eat and had written a quick letter to have me return. A doctor from the town had been invited the day before and was still staying at my house. After taking a few doses of his medicine, he was already able to talk. He also said that he went to visit my father every day. Because I had been running fast for a while, and hearing that my father's illness had taken a turn for the better, I sat down and relaxed for a while. "How was this police station established?" We chatted idly. "Ah, young master doesn't know. Recently, there have been frequent robberies in the countryside! Those robbers all have weapons. Old Master Song and Old Master Zhu were so scared that they moved to the town. Our master said that the town wasn't safe either, but with a police station, it would be slightly better. When he came out, the master asked the chief to set up a police station here. I was assigned here." When we came out, he helped me carry my suitcase and lantern to the gate of my house. The people at home had been waiting for me for a long time.</p>
<p>Rusty Scissors Chen Liang</p>
<p>Zhang Baoji Barber Shop, with its rotating red, white, and blue three-color glass cylinder. The window frame at the front of the shop had a round hole the size of a bowl, which was prepared for installing a stove chimney in the winter. The afternoon sunlight poured in through the round hole like water, so warm, like a spring wave or a hot spring. The hot spring poured on Xiao Rongsheng's head as he sat in the third swivel chair, flowing down, covering his left cheek, his left shoulder, and then flowing onto the chrome-plated armrest, reflecting a white, intense light. The barbershop was empty in the afternoon, just like the fields in the summer afternoon. Xiao Rongsheng had been dozing off there, just startled awake by the sound of water being released as the apprentice washed towels. "Little devil, thriftiness is dead!" he grumbled, frustrated. Turning his neck and opening his eyes, he felt joy, silently saying in his heart, "What a good sun." Using his palm instead of a towel, he rubbed his face all over, some loneliness, some boredom, mixed in with his emotions. Stretching his arms out behind his neck, he felt that his neck was not the place to put his arms. He lazily let them down and lazily reached for the brass handle of the drawer under the large mirror. However, he didn't intend to open the drawer. He knew that there was nothing inside except a pair of rusty scissors. However, he finally pulled the drawer open. The rusty scissors were still lying quietly among some scraps of paper, abandoned by him for two years. Sometimes, he discovered that the rust spots on the scissors were his own bloodstains, the bloodstains of life. Yes, he remembered that there was a day when the blood from the back of his head splattered on these scissors, bright red, bright red, still dazzling in his eyes, but... It was two years ago. It was probably an early winter evening. He remembered very clearly that he had just returned from working outdoors. The master glared at him angrily. Not a day went by without being scolded. Today was even worse because he had returned late. He humbly put down the high stool and washbasin stand from his sore and numb wrists. "How much money did you make?" the master asked, grinding his razor, in a loud voice. He trembled as he opened his tin toolbox, sorted out the coins from the rusty scissors, dull razor, wooden comb, and lice comb, counted them, two hundred and forty-three, and handed them to the master. The master didn't even bother to look at them, just kept grinding his razor. He went to help his colleagues pump the bellows. Apprentices in barbershops had it tough enough, working outside, working at home, being beaten and scolded was nothing. Working outdoors was even tougher, being exposed to the sun in the summer and the wind in the winter, being beaten by street cops, being bullied by hooligans, wandering from the east street to the west street, without a home or a way to live, thinking about it made him want to cry, tears. He was pumping the bellows with all his strength when suddenly he received a heavy blow to the back of his head. It was those rusty scissors. It was the master, beating the back of my head violently... "Little devil, you're always lazy outside, making so little money!" Blood flowed down from the back of his head, dripping onto his ragged willow trousers. He wiped it with his hand, red, his heart ached, he cried, but dared not cry out loud. He still had to hold his wound and pump the bellows. The next day when he went out, the rusty scissors were covered with purple bloodstains. Thinking about it, ah... tears, bitterness... But now he was a full-fledged barber, two years had passed. Xiao Rongsheng unintentionally saw his rusty scissors again, scissors marked with the scars of life. In this momentary recollection, he relived the bitter taste of life. The warm, spring-like afternoon sunlight poured on him, but he only felt a hot, stinging pain.</p>
