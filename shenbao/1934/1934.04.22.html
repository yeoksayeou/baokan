<p>（倫敦）美國駐英大使平海、今日往晤西門外相、討論東京發表日本在中國有『特殊地位』之宣言、彼等所研究者聞爲此問題之一般形勢，但因缺乏具體報告、致使不能恊商應取之行動，據稱，俟接得更詳盡之情報後再行會議，（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據今日官方表示、政府官員歡迎英美合作、以拒日本把持中國之外交、據稱、若以現狀觀之、兩國之合作、須在兩國輿論發展至相當程度或英國因其在華商業利害關係而向美接洽後，始能展開也、國務院現仍研究東京所發出之聲明、但因尚未接得日本政府之正式文書、故仍未作正式批評、惟形勢大有促成英美兩國對於遠東之意見、較日本侵佔滿洲後之任何時期更相團結云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）自日本外務省發表聲明之後、中國駐法公使顧維鈞博士向往訪之世界社記者稱、東京所發表關於中國之聲明書，實暴露日本力謀向亞洲大陸擴展之侵略政策、尤以向中國方面擴展之野心、更爲顯明、並證實其企圖損害中國之主權、及排斥其他列强在東亞所有天然富源、與夫中國市塲之利益、此項政策、實有背於遠東和平主旨、中國民衆深悉獨立主權國家之權利與義務、决不能贊成日本獨攬亞洲主權之主義、而其他列强亦决不能爲其威逼而接受之、如欲保證遠東和平、日本須放棄其殘忍之帝國侵略主義、遵守條約義務、顧博士之談話、法國各報無不登載云、（二十一日世界電訊社電）</p>

<p>我國舊式監獄。暗無天日。不幸而身繫囹圄。生趣盡絕。遑論感化。自淸末建議改革。創辦新監。迄今歷有年所。而成績仍鮮。民國二十二年度除東北四省外。全國共有舊式監獄四百五十一所。而新式監獄祇有三十三所。尚不足總數百分之七。而因農村破産。民生憔悴。飢寒交迫。廉恥道喪。作奸犯科之事。與</p>
<p>日俱積。是以各地監獄。皆有人滿之患。而尤以江浙皖鄂冀等省之繁盛都市爲特甚。舊式監房。每每𨺹隘汚穢。醫藥設備。更屬簡陋。而典獄吏中之無心肝者。仍在肆威作福。魚肉弱小。如尅扣囚糧。勒索敲詐等事。層出不窮。報載例證。不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>司法行政當局。爲剔除積弊起見。明令迭頒條例頻布。如十八年『訓政時斯擴充監所計劃。』二十年四月『縣監所恊進委員會章程』二十一年『監獄官練習規則。』『獄務研究所章程』等應有盡有。無奈各省新監獄之添設者仍寥寥可數。按司法行政當局所發表之改革計劃。訓政期内。全國應設新式監獄二百六十四所。（内計少年監四十七所。普通監一百七十四所。累犯監二十二所。肺病及精神病監二十一所。）新式看守所一千八百十五所。事實與理想之相去。何啻天淵。</p>
<p>經費困難。自爲一切改革計劃之阻碍。卽如去歲冬令本埠天氣嚴寒素以模範監獄見稱之江蘇第二監獄。男女監犯二千六百餘名。衣被不完者。十居八九。而以經費竭蹶。無力添製。乃不得不乞憐於慈善團體。募集救濟。以此類推。其他各監之困苦。更可想見。據監委高一涵氏報告。蘇省改建新監。在鎭江高郵等縣。亦曾有此計劃。推省政府及高等法院。均未撥欵。而僅責令各縣縣長自行籌募。以致年復一年。無從着手。夫建築新監或修補舊監。關係監犯生命。國家體面。本屬國家建設範圍。要不能以欵項支絀。長此推諉。年來魯省監獄狀况。頗有改良。烟台蓬萊威海各新監。辦理妥善。經法部派員視察。認爲華北之冠。魯省非富。成績獨優。可知事在人爲。</p>
<p>顧因監獄擁擠。而添築新監。不如安定民生。而减少犯法。古語云。『揚湯止沸。不如𨥏底抽薪。』職是之謂。然茲事體大。當由澈底澄淸政治着手。非本文所欲言。姑就司法範圍以内亟應實行諸端。扼要提出。藉爲全國監犯請命。（一）中央應速爲司法行政部。籌定的欵。專爲添建新監及改良舊監之用。（二）各省當局應盡力恊助中央。就可能範圍内。積極改良監獄之設備。與監犯之待遇。（三）積極施行感化主義。並授各犯以手工業及職業技術智識。以免出獄後。爲生計所迫。重蹈法網。（四）由各法院繼續厲行緩刑假釋保外服役等制度並力矯辦案遲緩及押而不訊訊而不判之積弊。庶幾覊押人犯。可以早日滿刑出獄。騰出空位。以資調劑。（五）司法行政部前擬在寗夏湛恩渠建設外役監。移犯墾植。繼而又有改就陜甘兩省先行試辦之說。此事原則。無可非議。應予推行。惟於選犯管理各點猶待悉心斟酌耳。</p>
<p>書書『辟以止辟。』『刑期無刑。』願我負責當局。念茲在茲。則若許身陷人間地獄窮極無告之監犯。或有重見光明之一日。</p>

<p>華東社云、歐亞航空公司、最近决定購用德國榮格賜ｊｕ５２號式全金屬飛機、查此項最新式飛機之購置、與歐亞航空公司最近所擴大航綫計劃、實有密切關係、因該公司除按照歷年之飛航計劃、由上海經南京·洛陽·西安·至蘭州·每星期仍各對飛一次外、自本年五月一日起、更另闢一由洛陽經漢口長沙至廣州、及由洛陽經太原至北平之航綫、卽在洛陽啣接、形成一由北平至廣州之直接航空交通、在此航綫上、爲謀乘客之舒適、及航程之縮短起見、乃購新機、該飛機可載乘客三十名、由北平至廣州、祇須八小時卽可到達、聞中國使用此種飛機、實以此次爲第一次、該公司昨又發表消息、此機於最近卽將到滬、將來平粤綫及至新疆之中德綫均將用該機飛航、又派工程師何恩、於昨日駕機出發、視察平粤綫、俾可於下月一日飛航、至滬新綫、則於本年六月間、亦可實現、茲將各情誌之如下、</p>
<h3 id="c136">派員視察平粤航線 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>該公司最近另闢之平粤航綫、已决定於五月一日起開航、公司方面、已派工程師何恩、於昨日出發視察該綫矣、五月一日開航之初、則仍用舊機、俟新機到滬、卽將改用、該新機爲ｊｕ５２號式飛機、計長十九公尺、高六公尺、寛三十公尺、機内裝有完整之無綫電通報設備、及審測方向儀器、雖不需地面無綫電台之帮忙、亦可　[Ｐ&gt;歐亞公司新購榮格賜巨型飛機（華東社贈）</p>
<p>在飛行中審定各航站及飛機本身之所在地點、而飛機之飛行、因之益獲無上之安全、飛機電台、係接連於駕駛員之座位、以便迷霧飛行時、駕駛員亦得從容從事於飛行本身所在地點之計算、機中坐位係皮製、極爲舒適、視綫亦極淸晰、乘客置身其中、賞覽兩旁景物、至堪悅目、機中并備有電氣𢊍房、以便乘客從容就食、距離二千公里之航程、中間如無降落、不到八小時之飛行時間、卽可到達、</p>

<p>— 章榮初</p>
<p>棉布爲生活必需、以全國人口之衆、消費範圍之擴大、在國民經濟、與國際貿易上、皆佔着重要地位、是以凡國民經濟、與世界經濟、起急劇變化、皆足影響我國的棉布事業、國内政治之變動、市塲之盛衰、果感受直接影響、卽世界經濟之變遷、國際關係之轉移、亦足波及、我國棉布事業、在歐戰中、因暫時脫離帝國主義經濟勢力之覇絆、一度繁榮後、自歐戰停止以來、無日不遭受帝國主義之長期剥削、以迄現在、農村破産之形勢、日益擴大、國民經濟之資源、日益枯竭、軍事與政治不絕之騷動、内地交通與運輸、以陷於長期阻滯、在内憂外患之侵襲下、棉布事業、益陷於極度恐慌、茲據觀測所得、分述我國棉布事業之危機、冀全國同胞、有所猛省焉、</p>
<p>（一）東北淪亡及中日滬戰自九一八事變以後、東北市塲、爲日本帝國主義者所掠奪、傀儡组織、受日本帝國主義之頥指氣使、樹森嚴之關稅壁壘、使關内棉布、不能往東三省銷售、於是平常以東三省爲市塲之棉布工廠、以推銷呆滯、存貨囤積、本身旣陷於困難、乃不得不出自殺性之競爭、於是市價每况愈下、自滬戰發生、上海棉布工廠、有被燬於砲火、有受金融停滯之影響、無法復業、而社會經濟、遭受十四萬萬元之鉅額損失、人民之購買力、更形薄弱、是以東北事件、與一二八滬戰、影響我國産業甚鉅、棉布工業、其尤要者也、</p>
<p>（二）世界經濟恐慌與傾銷政策自不景氣之怒潮、普遍全世界後、各帝國主義國家、無法補救自身之經濟矛盾、乃以傾銷政策爲最後之苟延、我國棉布工業、在帝國主義之傾銷政策下、遭受之損失尤鉅、消費者僅享受少數廉價之小惠、而有機體组織之棉布生産機關、乃爲分别擊破、尤以日帝國主義之處心積慮、旣奪我東北市塲、復在我國本部、施行積極傾銷、而日商大率資本雄厚、利息輕微、設備週全、技術精良、勞資融洽、運输便利、政府又從而保護之、是以近十年來、在中國境内、已戰勝英美二國、以期獨佔中國市塲、必欲使我國全體人民、永遠處於被剥削之地位、而滿足其慾望、（未完）</p>

<p>（續）</p>
<p>當然，這様說，是並不認爲『啼笑因緣』就已經把握住了時代精神，『啼笑因緣』已其了它的濃厚的社會意義；相反的，『啼笑因緣』並沒有達到這一點。一部有社會意義的偉大作品，無論他的描寫，是在肯定的方面，或否定的方面，無論它是暴露沒落階級的罪惡，或啓示新興階級的成長，都應該儘量發揮其積極性，應該從那複雜的社會生活中，烘襯出正在進展着的社會動向。然而，啼笑因緣所把握的所描寫的，却只是一些社會上的浮彫；消極的，歪曲的，亂雜無意的。於是在整個故事的結構上，也就形成一種『偶然』的凑合，逃不出傳奇小說那種『唱戲脫了節，除非神仙來接』的圈套。『十三妹』式的關秀姑，和『行使好義』的壽峯之出現，不過是爲完成那『山寺鋤奸』，『魔窟逃生』的幾個場面而已。把天橋的江湖賣技之流，寫成『神龍』般的鋤强技弱的俠義，已經是超越了現實，而把萬惡軍閥的命運，歸結於一個『天上有世間無』的女俠之手，其歪曲現實，逃避現實，更是不言可喻了。啼笑因緣，就其社會的意義上說，就其藝術的評價上說，均是失敗的，它只浮淺地攝取了一些片斷的社會外景，絲毫不曾加以選擇，加以精煉，而提示出那一特定社會生活的特徵。</p>
<p>那末，啼笑因緣是怎様捉住它的讀者呢？如前面所說及，中國的畸形社會，反映到人們的生活思想上，也成爲畸形的。啼笑因緣所攝取的，雖然是些浮彫，但這様融合『上下古今』千餘年的不同的生活様式於一處，正是它能迎合一般游離市民層的脾胃的地方。啼笑因緣的讀者，無疑的正是那些游離不定的市民以及一般的資産階级。</p>
<p>在動亂的大時代内，在從某一社會算近到另一社會的過渡期内，小資産階級的市民層是一方面在追尋那級醉金迷的資産階級的生活，别一方面却在毒恨當前的萬惡社會。在啼笑因缘内，對於這種羣衆心理，却恰巧投射了一付興奮劑。</p>
<p>啼笑因緣所描寫的生活基調，是充滿了官僚貴族間的享樂生活的氣分的，不僅劉將軍輩之一擲千金不足異，卽陶太太三四十塊錢的一雙鞋子，和何麗娜每月千元的買花費，也只好使樊家樹自愧，『沒有見過世面』罷了。這種備極豪華的生活，正是一般小市民追求的生活。不過在這裏，我們應應指出的，是作者完全忽視了否定的方面，而只着力於肯定的描寫，僅僅注意到它的靜的姿態，而沒有把握它的活躍的動向。貴族官僚之豪華生活，不過是其自身的迴光返照，日趨崩潰之另一種表現。作者不把故事這様展開，只逃避地，給予樊家樹以一種平民思想的注射，使之避開高貴時髦的何麗娜，而愛上混跡風塵中的沈鳳喜；其結果，更强調地使何麗娜也脫離她的富豪，以至達到「那屋裏的汽油燈光，將一雙人影，照着印在紫幔上』的最終目的。這種表現方法，却恰好又迎合了那些小市民層的心理。他們在追尋資産階級生活的行程上，因爲社會條件的限制，遇着無可解决的阻礙，於是感到悲哀，於是發生厭惡，但他們是不敢正面去求解决的，在無可奈何中，平民思想便必然地成爲他們自慰的法寳了。</p>
<p>啼笑因緣也和其他武俠戀愛小說一様，對於小資産階級市民層，是能射入一些暫時的快感的。在中國，軍閥官僚的横暴殘忍，如强佔沈鳳喜之類的事，是最平常的事，也是最使人切齒的事。但中國的小資産階級，大都是有怯弱的根性的，阿Ｑ那様的人物，充滿了這一中間層，他們不敢針對着現實的正面，不敢舉起拳頭作實踐的鬭爭，於是卽使不滿意，卽使懷恨在心，也只好關在屋内，『指天駡地』鬧一番就算精神的勝利了。這現象，表現到政治上來就成爲希望有鋤强扶弱的俠客出現的那種幻覺，在本書内，關壽峯的肝膽照人，救朋友於危困，關秀姑之出生入死『爲民除奸』，可說是最能使人感到痛快的場面。可惜的，是這種『山寺鋤奸』的把戲，旣不是現社會所有的事，更不能作爲啓發大衆的信條，這不過是在封建社會支配階級之影響下的文人，秉承意旨地製造出來麻醉民衆的毒藥『啼笑因緣』的作者却毫無客氣的接受了這份遺産。這點作者於啼笑因緣不能不說『誠有遺憾。』</p>
<p>此外，啼笑因緣，又點綴了　一些悲歡離合的情節，樊家樹初與沈鳳喜之『情緻纒綿，』終而至於『裂卷飛蚨，』這些都是合乎資産階級生活情趣的。</p>
<p>以上，可說已經把啼笑因緣能風行一時的原因叙明了。作者是完全着穿了上中社會層羣團的游離心理，在麻醉大衆作用上，在歪曲現實的任務上，是盡了他的職責。惟其這様，所以我們應該再進一步來檢討它所表現的中心思想是什麽。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c236">英國中學敎育之現狀 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>（下）</p>
<p>— 朱鎭蓀</p>
<p>（八）男女同學</p>
<p>在英國倫敦除掉一些小學之外、男女同學是很少見的、但在其他的地方男女同學是很普通的、在全英國有一半的方男女同校是超過男女分校的數目、這種男女同校一方面固然是爲了節省經費、但一方面亦是根據敎育的立塲、其實許</p>
<p>多英國敎育學家認爲男女同學是敎育中一種特殊的階段、</p>
<p>（九）敎師待遇</p>
<p>關於中學敎英國師的待遇約有兩種不同的標凖、卽有學位的與無學位的兩種、關於有學位的敎師、在男的方面自二百七十六至五百二十八金鎊、每年可增加自十五金鎊、至十八年爲止、在女的方面自二百六十四至四百二十金鎊、每年可增加十四金鎊至十四年爲止、至於無學位的敎師、在男的方面自二百零四至四百三十二金鎊、每年可加十五金鎊、至二十年爲止、在女的方面自一百九十二至三百四十二金鎊、每年可加九金鎊、至十八年爲止、凡中學敎師在六十歲至六十五歲時告退職的、可得他全部服務期中一半的養老金、</p>
<p>（十）中心學校</p>
<p>在英國倫敦、中心學校约有一百、這種學校不是一個完全的中學、因爲牠只有四年的學程、頗與我們的初中相似、在前兩學年内學生須受同一的科目、内中有現代外國語、在後兩學年内、學生所學的多偏於商業或工業方面的知識、這種學校之目的乃在供給學生從事職業的準備、茲將斯旦烈（Ｓｔａｎｌａｙ）中心學校的課程（偏於工業方面）叙述於下、以資參考、</p>
<p>（一）聖經、（二）英文、（三）德文、（四）地理、（五）歷史、（六）數學、（七）化學、（八）物理、（九）圖畫與藝、（十）木工和煉金屬、（十一）音藥、（十二）體操、</p>
<p>中心學校是不收學費的、所以欲入的人頗多、然因名額有限、故競爭頗烈、牠選擇學生是根據學生在十一歲時所應之初級那奬學金考試的結果、爲標凖的、凡在中學校中未得地位的學生、在中心學校中或可以獲得貴位、因爲他們在十三歲時、還有機會參加中心學校的考試、凡在中學和中心學校中都未得到地位的學生、須入高級小學補習、直到十四歲爲止、在這裏面的工作多半爲手工活動、</p>
<p>中心學校在外表和精神上都可稱爲中學、因爲牠裏面的學生都是受成年男女學生的待遇、所有的男女敎師亦屬專家、他們的程度都和中學内的男女敎師相同、不過薪俸比他們較低罷了、</p>

<p>— 郭品娟</p>
<p>小朋友：你們知道嗎？我們中國人爲什麽被外國人稱爲『東亞病夫』呢？這是多麽可恥的稱呼啊！</p>
<p>我們中國人從前因爲太過分看重文人，輕視武人，所以不但讀書的學生願做一個斯文人，就是其他的人也很羨慕做一個斯文人，於是他們對於運動，體育不注意，對於身體不鍜鍊，弄得人人弱不經風，像一個病夫了。</p>
<p>小朋友：你們想想，一個身體像病夫般衰弱的人，雖然很有學問，但他能夠替國家做些什麽呢？何怪我們中國一天一天的衰弱，何怪外國人譏稱我們是『東亞病夫』？　　在這弱肉强食的世界上，文弱的民族是要被淘汰的，有尚武的精神：纔可以生存。小朋友：你們要洗雪『東亞病夫』的恥辱嗎？你們要創造偉大事業嗎？你們要中國强盛起來嗎？那末大家要有尚武的精神！</p>
<h3 id="c238">石童子 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 袁翕孚</p>
<p>小朋友·你們要聽石童子的故事嗎？我現在把這故事講給你們聽。可憐的嘉定！在明朝時，時常有倭賊來擾亂，把東西搶去，房子燒掉，人民殺死。那時的縣長陰鳳麟，他是一個老糊塗，甚麽事情都不知道的。城外的人沒辦法，逃進城裏，可惡的倭賊，又要打進城來，城上幸有兵和老百姓，日夜守著，所以沒有被他們打破。</p>
<p>有一夜，守城的人都疲乏得要睡，倭賊又從城上爬起來，守城的人還沒知道，忽然有一個童子，大呌道：『賊來了，賊來了，』守城的人聽見了，連忙起來殺賊，把倭賊殺死了不少。</p>
<p>賊去了，大家去找喚人的童子，那裏知道那可憐的童子，已給贼人們殺死了！</p>
<p>後來有人紀念他，把石頭刻成童子的像，建立在嘉定城的西北門上，至今還保存着呢！</p>
<h3 id="c239">鳥類爲甚麽要爭鬥？ <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 許宗傑</p>
<p>從前達爾文說：『鳥類的爭鬥，是雄的爲爭奪雌的而發生，可說是爲了戀愛問題。』後經許多動物學家的研討，纔知這句話不十分的靠得住。因爲它們爭鬥的時候，雄的和雄的，雌的和雌的，一齊加入戰團，捉對兒厮殺。從這點上看來，它們是决不爲了戀愛的問題了。</p>
<p>原來鳥類的爭鬥，據豪厄德說：它們是爲了地盤，也可以說是食料。因爲它們找到了適宜的樹枝，做了窠兒以後，决不再容旁的鳥類，到這兒來棲留。並且在這窠兒周圍的地方，也像它有權管轄似的，不許其他鳥類來覓食。倘使有鳥類來侵犯它的主權，它一定起來奮鬥　　諸位小朋友們·鳥類尚知愛護領士，我們做人的應當怎様呢？</p>
<h3 id="c240">掃墓 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>在一個春光明媚的日子，我們離别了故鄕，到鄕下去祭掃祖先們的墳墓。</p>
<p>我們悶悶的坐在一艘穩固的汽船上。那時船上的人很擁擠，我擠在裏面差不多連氣都喘不過來，男的女的，老幼少壯。有的在談笑，有的在吃東西，有的把頭探出窗外看野景。</p>
<p>我也向窗外看，只見滿田都是金黃色的菜花，岸的兩旁的排列著一株株的垂柳隨著微風飄蕩。</p>
<p>到了我們的目的地。那時已近中午了。</p>
<p>經過了一帶密密的樹林，跨過了幾條淺淺的水沼，走過了高低不平的山路，便到了我們的墓前。　　一堆的黃土，這是我們的祖先們安身之地。前面還安放著一張石桌，我們便把祭菜陳列在那桌上。點香燭。燒紙幣：一個個挨次的叩頭，忙個不了。</p>
<p>同時我的祖母還不住的說：『望祖宗保佑我們大大小小健康平安！』</p>
<p>唉！在這一堆黃土中，埋葬着幾具腐朽的靈柩。祖先們的肉體，早已成了骷髏了。生命也沒有了。祖母所說的話，</p>
<p>是不是對着那些骷髏說的嗎？這眞是老太太們迷信的舉動。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們也有老祖母嗎？大概總是一様的吧。</p>

<p>— 江淹</p>
<p>小朋友，在沒有看文以前你可以先看圖。</p>
<p>圖看過了你不是覺得在每一個圖中綫是有着長短嗎？可是，你錯了、不相信你可以拿尺來量。告訴你，它們都是一様長的。</p>
<p>量了後你是是有些感想嗎？－－眼睛爲什麽會錯呢？</p>
<p>我告訴你，我們的眼睛是不可靠的，它往往會給我們錯誤，有的甚而至於不能够看見。所以，下次你做任何事情，你不應該單拿眼睛來看，用腦筋來審察，來考慮，是必須的條件。</p>

<p>— 昭德</p>
<p>小朋友，你們所穿的校服，不是時常要洗的麽？雇人家洗呢？還是媽媽給你洗？晒乾後怎様？不是很皺的不像様子嗎？你們除了用熨斗外，有沒有想到一個經濟的熨斗來熨平直呢？你們如果沒有想到過，現在我就來將自己曾經試用過的經濟的熨斗告訴你們吧！所謂經濟的熨斗，是不必用炭的！那末你們一定要問，不用炭，究竟用甚麽呢？形狀怎様，用什麽東西做的？請不必慌吧！這是無論那家都有的琺瑯器！牙粉罐，（不過要稍大一些）你如用了開水注入，蓋了蓋，這様，經濟的熨斗就成功了！你就可拿來熨衣服，袴子，非但輕便，經濟，而且熨起衣服來，和眞的熨斗沒有兩様呢！</p>
<p>小朋友，你們不妨拿已晒乾而皺着的衣服來試試看！</p>

<p>『元』！一次我問他：『你爲甚恁地消瘦？』</p>
<p>『先生！我不常吃飯呀！』他低垂了頭。</p>
<p>『哟！吃甚呢？』</p>
<p>『四個銅板，兩個圓子！』他顫着喉嚨。</p>
<p>『不愛吃飯嗎？』</p>
<p>『不，飯遲，怕趕不上課！』他抬起了頭。</p>
<p>『媽媽心裏不疼嗎？』</p>
<p>『兩歲上媽媽就丢下了我！』他眼圈紅了，『我跟着姑母，····』</p>
<p>『爸爸呢？』我緊緊握着他。</p>
<p>『哦，先生！過去不久的一個深夜，我又變做了孤·····孤兒！····』他哭了。</p>

<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>揩石板小朋友：你們學校裏抄書用石板嗎？是不是用石筆把書本上的字照様寫在石板上的？石板上的字抄滿之後，不是要揩去的嗎？如果你用乾的紙頭或乾的布頭去揩，那末寫在石板上的石筆粉，就要飛揚起來；一不留意的呼吸進去，是對於肺臟要有害的。然而有甚麽辦法呢？只要當你揩石板上的石筆字時候以前，先用水澆一些在石板上，再用紙或布去揩；或者直接用濕紙頭或濕布去揩，也是一様的。這様：石筆粉就不會飛揚了。　　硯台小朋友：你們用的硯台，如果久長了，硯台的四週，不是就有許多的積墨堆存着麽？這時候你磨起墨來，是不是覺得很費工夫？而且你一不小心，在磨墨的當兒，墨碰在堆存硯上積墨的時候，墨汁就會濺出來的，甚至濺在你的衣服上面。這不是很討厭的嗎？如果你們遇到這個情形，希望你們趕快把硯台上的積墨洗去；那末非但磨起墨來很容易濃厚，而且還省工夫。　　附白如果先生呌你揩黑板上粉筆所寫的字；你可以照『揩石　』的方法做去，那末粉筆灰是不會飛進你的鼻腔和嘴裏去的。　　你們的硯台，卽使它的四週沒有積墨，也可以在每星期日洗滌一次；雖然雙手吃點小苦，但是磨用起來，比沒有洗滌以前的硯台，是好得多了。</p>

<p>— 金鏞</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們不是很喜歡聽故事嗎？現在我來講給你們聽罷。</p>
<p>從前，有一個樵夫在河邊砍樹。偶然，他的斧頭落到河裏，沉下去了。樵夫失去了他心愛的斧頭，很是悲傷。河之神聽見了。從河裏拿了一把金斧頭給他。樵夫不承認是他本來的斧頭。河之神再鑽入河裏，拿了一把銀斧頭，他仍舊不承認、末了，河之神拿了他本來失去的斧頭給他。於是，他很快活地謝了河之神的美德。河之神愛憐他很是誠實，便把金斧頭和銀斧頭一并送給他。　　後來，這消息被他的一個朋友知道了。他也想發財。所以、他喬裝了樵夫，也在這河邊砍樹；故意把他的斧頭抛到河裏去。於是，他坐在河邊放聲大哭。河之神聽見了他的哭聲，跑去問他爲什麽哭？他假意地說：『因爲失去了斧頭』河之神仍舊鑽入河裏也拿了一把金斧頭上來。</p>
<p>『是，眞是我的斧頭呀！』他心裏忍不住說：</p>
<p>河之神大怒了。狠狠地駡他不應該說謊，把他落掉的斧頭也不給他了！　　小朋友們！你們應該做一個誠實的孩子。在上面的故事中，不是很顯明地告訴你們——誠實是對於你們的一生，很有利益。</p>

<p>大敎室</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>諸位的讀書地方在那裏？大概都在有門窗的房子的敎室裏罷。你們要得到知識，專門在書本上刻板地探求。但，我來考你一下：我拿兩桿麥，一桿是大麥，一桿是小麥，你誠實地答復一句，能識别麽？我們常常遇到研究植物的先生到鄕村來，許許多多植物名字還不能認出呢！</p>
<p>我們的敎室，沒有門户的，樹林裏是我們研究的塲所，河灘頭是我們休閒活動的地方，那些田野，土墩，都是我們讀書的所在。我們的書本，是一片樹葉，一朶美麗的鮮花。田裏種的，河裏游的，天上飛的。地上長的，這些這些，都是我們活的書本；因爲，它是活的，引起了我們不少學習興趣。這種學習的塲合，我們呌它『大敎室』；除掉很少時在屋内的敎室中讀呆的書外，大部時間，化在大敎室裏。</p>
<p>大敎室裏空氣新鮮，　　了身體舒暢精神煥發；書本内容充實，要研究什麽，就是什麽；天文，地埋，有生物，無生理，什麽都有；所有自古以來的大科學家，怪不得都從『大敎室』畢業出來的。</p>

<p>— 汪恒久</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！先前學范君在『動物的睡眠』中，告訴了我們幾種動物的睡態，這個確是很有意味的，這裏我不過略加以補充些。</p>
<p>脚短而肥胖的走獸，如象·犀牛·河馬等，他們睡的時候，先彎了脚，放在肚皮下面，然後倒身躺下去，把四脚伸直。獅·虎·豹等食肉獸，睡時像貓一様。還有一種長頸鹿，又名麒麟的，睡時總是把頭彎過去放在後腰部。熊睡時，總是把頭躱在身子裏；不過在美國更有一種奇特的熊，性很懶惰，睡時把四隻脚倒掛樹枝上，像蝙蝠一般，用爪抓住樹枝，我們看去，覺得這種睡法很是吃力，其實他的脚很是有勁，他越睡得熟，脚把樹枝也抓得越緊，小朋友們，你們想奇怪不奇怪呢？</p>
<p>還有家兎·松鼠·睡時簡直不像睡，只是縮做一團。其他如禽類中的鳥·鷄·鷺等，睡時總是直立着不動，把頭躱在自己的翼下。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！上面這些都是動物們奇怪的睡覺法，不過其餘還有許多呢！因限於篇幅，不能再寫了。</p>
<h3 id="c250">新生活 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 馬培元先生講三下張瑞大記</p>
<p>今天來和小朋友們談新生活，我們先要明白甚麽呌做生活？生活就是人類謀生存的活動。不論農·工·商·學·政治····都是生活，那末甚麽呌做新生活呢？新生活是有意義的生活，有意義的生活又是怎様呢？現在我可以舉一個例子來說明：譬如昨天王家伯伯，不到田裏去工作，反到街上去賭錢、把一百元賣牛錢，輸得只剩二十三元了，就很氣悶的走到酒館裏去，吃了三斤高梁，一瓶陳酒，醉薰薰的跑回家去，扭着老婆子打架，隔了一夜，他醒過來，自已覺得昨天不應該賭錢。吃酒·更不應該打老婆子，想着，立卽走到廚房下，向老婆子道歉，老婆子問他說：你旣然知道昨天做錯了事，那末爲什麽偏要做這種錯事呢？王伯伯給伊問得閉口無言，只得笑笑的走開，小朋友！你們覺得王伯伯這種生活，有意義嗎？所以我說；無論做甚麽事，能够先问一個爲什麽？—爲甚麽這様？爲甚麽不那様？能够答得出這個爲甚麽的，便是有意義的生活，也就是所謂新生活了。新生活的範圍很大，不論政治的，經濟的·社會的·敎育的·都是這様，所以我希望小朋友們，以後也要過着有意義的新生活啊！至於小朋友們的新生活是怎様？請你們细細的去想罷！</p>

<p>考試院院長，兼中國童子軍總會主任戴季陶，近爲發揚童軍精神起見、曾編就兩闋中國童子軍歌；和野火歌。現在把它錄在下面：</p>

<p>野火歌：燒野火，燒野火，野火放光明，野火放光明。滿天星斗向我笑，問我，此火照何人？此火來自戈壁大沙漢；來自拉薩百丈城；來自靑海頭；來自黃河根。照我好哥哥：照我好弟弟：照我好姐姐：照我好妹妹。照我弟兄姐妹一顆心；照我弟兄姐妹一顆心；大家齊歡唱，心地放光明；大家齊歡心，心地放光明！</p>

<h3 id="c267">兩性關係的演進 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 茲</p>
<p>生物學家告訴我們：地球上的生活，初無性别，由細胞的分裂而繁殖，此後細胞漸有大小動靜之差，才有所謂男性女性之别，此等兩性細胞之結合，謂之有性生殖。女性細胞——卵子，常較男性細胞－－精虫，大二三千倍，徵諸下級生物的個體，女性—如雌蚤及蜂之女王，常大於男性，卽其證明，且女性細胞對於男性細胞有取捨之權，所以男性爲取悅女性計，有改造個體之必要，如高級動物的雄者常較雌者美麗而壯偉。這是動物界中兩性關係演進的一般。至於人，自脫離了猿的境界，成了萬物之靈以後、兩性關係，自然較一切動物不同，茲將人類兩性關係的演進，作史的緒述：</p>
<p>（一）原始時代—母系中心時代。人類自從脫離了　自由性交的動物境界後、性交有限制——親子不交，於是親子有别，社會因之而産生。但當時的洪水猛戰，在大足以爲人類之患，所以男子不得不日事征伐於外，或游牧他邦，行踪不定，生死無常。女子爲繁殖種族計，就附近耕耘，兼飼育子女，生活比較安定。因系一妻多夫，所以子女，只知有父。女性支配一切，也是母權高於一切。</p>
<p>（二）封建時代—父系中心時代。人力戰勝了自然，男陈捨遊牧而務農，生活漸安，土地漸屬私有，女子專事生産，養育，或僅助耕耘及其他家庭手工業，由此經濟權全操於男子之手，线權從此中落，子女以父之姓爲性，父權代替了母權，男性支配了一切，女性由此變成了男性的屬從，與家畜土地同様成爲男子所私有。並由此男性中心封建的社會，製成了一切牢籠女性的敎條，女性從此不特無權，且也失去了『人』的地位。　　（三）資本主義時代－女子的雙重奴隸時代。自十八世紀末叶，歐洲産業革命後，機械代替了人力，打家了家庭手工業，一方男子之爲佃農苦力者，自身旣無以養活，安能顧家？於是女子亦棄家外出，爲工爲傭，任人呼飭使喚，剥削，由是一般貧苦女子由男子屬從下，又做了工廠或人主的奴屬。雙重的奴隸！或流爲娼妓。</p>
<p>（四）兩性等時代。時輪向前進展着，社會一天天在變化，物極必反，女子處此非人的地域上生存，必羣起而謀改善，同時一部分異性間當亦有同情的援助，那時男陈都爲生産之一員，誰不爲誰所奴屬。人人有選擇職業的自由，人人有戀愛的自由，人各有其業，人各有其自由，旣無怨女，亦無食傭夫。這並不是烏托邦，有的國家已在實行着。</p>
<p>我國上古代似尚不輕視女性，徵諸女媧鍊石補天的神話·是證明女性之有偉大能力。亦拿母系中心之說，但自儒敎思想支配了人民的腦筋以後，男尊女卑的思想，比任何國利害，易經中的『乾道成男，坤道成女，乾爲天，坤爲地，天尊地卑。』早已把女性當爲男性的脚墊了。詩經中的『乃生男子，載寢之牀，載弄之璋，乃生女子，載寢之地，載弄之瓦。』女性從小就是那末被賤棄，又有三從四德的長鋉短鐐，將女性重重鎖住，幸虧天地間尚不能缺少女性這權器，不然中國的女性或早被這些敎化，化盡歸天了。數千年來，其間總算武則天撑了一口氣，但她只爲個人未及喚醒一切女性，終歸失敗，且亦無補於後代女性。最近卅年來，歐美婦運的狂灡，亦波及了這遠東古國，已有了相當的反應。但一般婦女仍不是醉生夢死，就是牛馬地活着。卽中國整個國家，也在帝國主義的重壓下，中國的女性，更是受着重重壓迫。但我相信物極必反。重壓下的人們呵，起來·我們並不希望女性壓倒一切男性，再建母系中心的社會，我們希望的是男女眞平等的社會。</p>
<h3 id="c268">談瓦 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>詩經上說：生了男孩，給他弄璋（平）：生了女孩，給她弄瓦。宋時稱妓院曰瓦舍，或稱瓦子。看來瓦字常常用在女人身上；有時賀人生女曰『弄瓦之喜』，則竟以瓦完全代表女人。</p>
<p>七尺鬚眉，與婦人女子的差異，等於玉與瓦的差異。古者許多好漢，當危急存亡之秋，常說一句硬話：『寗爲玉碎，不爲瓦全。』若用弄璋弄瓦的觀點引申起來說，便是：寗爲死丈夫，不爲活女人。</p>
<p>年來國勢垂危，東崩西裂，正是男兒玉碎的時候、然而却默默鮮右所聞。該不是社會上丈夫爲數極少，活着的多是女人？</p>
<p>這也許是實在情形，國中任怎様沒有統計，也知道該是女多於男。試看除了一夫多妻制活躍以外，各地的娼妓，莫不是與日俱增。而且所謂對仙對外的戰爭，怕謂肅淸徒的工作，在大都需要男兒的生命。若果中國也像日本那様，组織起『索夫團』來，那必是洋洋大觀；至於靑年寡婦，她們的丈夫已經入地，那還沒有資格加入這行陣之中。可是所有這些失了伴侶的女性，受到禮義廉恥的薰陶還淺，她們旣不守貞節，也不索故夫，相率走入於『桃花江』，『美人窩』。革命尚未成功，婦女全不努力，可爲浩嘆！</p>
<p>對於這些無廉鮮恥的婦女，大抵居上位者都寛恕她們是女流無知；而處身貧賤者，又多憐憫她們是走頭無路。然也有一種人，以爲這是女性向男性的報復，是婦女運動的先河。其意以爲男子是女子的敵人，對敵人無所不用其殘酷手段。最好是刀鋸鼎鑊，處置一番；無奈這些東西不能到手，便只得用欺騙，玩弄，抛棄，叛變等等方法。卽便生活不成問題，也當搖身效美人窩之行。　　這見解是怎様的錯誤，何待言論？窮此之數，是不是要盡驅男子入於淵海，而建立所謂『女子國』？幸而抱此見解的只是極少數的無知女流，中華民族，尚不至受具影響而有危殆之懼。</p>
<p>然而可懼的是近乎這類的錯誤，竟　漫於日常的社會現象。大抵是把與自己相抵觸的敵人，看得泰山般重；而把整個的大問題，看得鴻毛般輕。集其全心全力，日以窮治己所謂敵人爲事。欺詐殘忍，不擇其方；男兒壽短，元氣消亡。</p>
<p>窮此之數、自是『瓦舍』之數日增，『瓦解』之兆日明，『瓦舍』之風日熾，『瓦全』之流日衆；將見何莫而非瓦，全國成爲一片『瓦礫』。這算是瓦的勝利！</p>
<h3 id="c269">幾種急救法 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 友白</p>
<p>人們在世上，時時刻刻都有生命危險的可能，所以重要而又簡便的急救法，人人存知道的必要，現在略述如左：　　（１）創傷，俺溺或愛劇烈的損傷的人，往往呈顯虚脫狀態，就是脈搏微細，面色蒼白，心臟衰弱，呼吸困難等。這時候應立刻將受傷者平直仰臥，使其全身舒適，頭部稍低，如果尚有知覺，可飲以亞讹香酒少許，如已失知覺，須用棉花蘸阿英尼亞少許置其鼻前，傷者嗅之，卽能恢復知覺。最應注意的，就是知覺消失的時候，最忌受寒，必須將受傷者。睡在温暖的地方，并用熱水袋放在他的身旁或足旁，但不可過熱，以免燙傷。</p>
<p>（２）如受創傷流血不止、要用潔凈的紗布或布條重懕壓傷部，倘仍不止、須用橡此管製成富有彈力性的止血帶縛之，惟此法祇有經騐者始可使用，否則使用不得法，反而有害。</p>
<p>（３）此膚破傷，切忌用手撫摸，應立時用消毒棉花蘸碘酒等殺菌藥塗於傷處，再用潔凈之紗布條包紥，傷勢較重者，應送醫院。</p>
<p>（４）鼻血最普通的急救法，就是把頭抬頭高或坐起，用口呼吸，并在鼻之上部以覆冷水手巾或冰袋，如果仍舊不止，就該請醫生設法了。</p>
<p>總之，急救法都是緊急臨時應變的方法，凡一切重傷大病，往往都是由小而轉劇的，如因手指或包紥布等不淸潔，而變成危險症候的很多很多，所以最好還是趕快去請醫生來治療。</p>

<p>— 先</p>
<p>人家都這様說：『你太好了』。但，我是想要得到『對』與『不對』的批判。然而世人沒有絕對的『對』與『不對』的批判；誰又肯告訴我：『你是對的』或『你是不對』呢？爲什麽『『太』好了』？我明白：這只是弱者的同情的嘆詞，如果這個有是我的朋友；否則那就是在諷笑我是個愚蠢的傻子。</p>
<p>父親知道我的不幸的遭遇時，他像是生氣般對我說：『你怎様做的；眞沒有用·你就運自己的丈夫也抓不住！』唉。連父親也不知道我的『心』！</p>
<p>當我們相愛了不久以後、我才知道他在我們相愛不久之前，曾熱戀着另外一個女人的；但不知道他和她如何破裂了。－－據說是她不肯答應他的要求，便破裂了。</p>
<p>我把我和他的種種事情告訴了我的好友以後，她就替我擔憂起來：在她以爲一個剛剛從熱戀裏走出來的男人，立刻會又熱戀着第二個女人、把第一個女人忘記得這様快，這個男人的感情太會變動，太容易遷移，　。她警告我：『你能相信他，不會再去熱戀第三個女人嗎？』於是我開始懷疑，猶豫，我想要離開他。但是他是那麽様倔强：他寫了一篇『侮辱』駡我的朋友卑鄙，駡她們不該破壞我們的愛。自然，我的朋友便忿然地離開我了。</p>
<p>他對我曾懇切的解剖着－－用各種的方法來表出他的心的誠懇。最後，他結看；他打碎了他的先生送給他的寳贵的琵琶；並且告訴我：－他同時舉起他的手給我看，他的手腕上脈筋處一條半寸長的傷痕，用像皮膏貼着－－他要自殺，他寫好了給我的『血書』。</p>
<p>我看着打碎了的琵琶和他手上的傷痕，非常感動，非常傷心；抛棄了懷疑，　　了猶豫，我就做了感情的俘虜，他不肯（不忍嗎？給我）</p>
<p>看他所『說』的『血書』，而我深深相信他是的確做了這件凄凉的愚蠢的事，並且感激他愛我之眞誠；我不曾想到過：他是用『死』來恐嚇一個感情質的弱女子。</p>
<p>他終於得到勝利：『佔有』了第二個女人。我們同居了五年，生了三個孩子。我們在借錢，當當、甚至於挨餓的生活壓迫下，過着『性』的不調和，『性情』的不調和的衝突生活：我們時常會發生吵鬧的，甚至於有時他打我；但是我們也常常說着，想着；我們是相愛的。</p>
<p>過了五年，我們的生活，慢慢從經濟好起來；然而我們的愛，那知就暗暗地現出明顯的破裂，雖然他仍舊還說着他是愛我，我也相信我是愛他－－曾經他也對我說過他愛我的朋友，我的朋友嚴格地拒絕他，後來她結了婚，這件事就寢息了許多時。我們離開不久之前，他曾對我提起過：他愛××；但他馬上向我懺悔並且說：他不應該愛别人。我也曾看出他待我的異様和我們中間的裂痕，可是我認爲我不應該輕易的懷疑他；我應該信任他，諒解他。何况他是一個忠誠的，曾以『碎琴』，『世脈筋』，『寫血書』爲誓約的，他的『良心』會允許他背約嗎？－然而我也曾想：如果我們從前是錯誤的結合，現在他發現了我們俩之間的不調和，同時他另外尋到了愛，他願意提出離婚，我决这接受的；因爲我自己早已覺得和他同居後之不安－並非物質的缺少的簡單問題－－不過我還希望我們大家的忍耐一些，也许爲了孩子我們會慢慢的相安起來。</p>
<p>我萬想不到他會用欺騙的法子來離開我，陷害我，他怕我也會用『死』來要挾他嗎？在我生下第三個孩子的第二個月裏，他便對我說：他已經計劃好了，他决定到日本去。我曾經聽到他說過多次：他說他沒有讀够書，是一生的恨事。他要想法子到日本去。因此，我相信着而且深幸他能遂他的志願。爲了鼓勵他的進取，不欲以家室拖累他，我就帶着三個孩子，而且依照他的意旨，回到我的家鄉－－湖南－去。我以爲：我對他的任務是應該如此帮助他的。我爲什麽不懷疑他？防範他？因爲我以爲『愛』應該『信任』。就算他是設下計策來離開我，我不離開他有什麽意義？倘若他是眞心愛我，這正是一個最好的試金石。然而我仍然深深地相信着：他兩年後從日本回來，會能如他所說的！他在社會上有較高的『地位』，有更多的『金子』；我們將有很好的生活來到的。</p>
<p>但我們離開不久，他和另外一個女人在上海同居了；可是我並不知道。他寫信給我仍然是說很記　着我們的；過了一年半以後，我才從他的新愛人的家裏聽到了他們同居的消息。我寫信去問他爲什麽不公開的告訴我和商量三個孩子的問題時，他的回信是坦折的承認了；可是他仍然說着懺悔的，極令人感動的調子－－他說他和她已有了長久的歷史，又生了孩子，他是墮入了情網不能超拔。他說他還是要愛我，要和我重結婚。他說他太愛孩子了，他喜歡孩子多，他還要和我生孩子。</p>
<p>我從她的家裏得到他和她相愛的故事，知道他又是用着老調子佔有了第三個女人。－她的父親對我說？他對她說：如果她不答應他的要求時，他就要『死』。因此，她終於被他佔有。他又勝利了。</p>
<p>我和他離開五年了。五年中我們的距離是天北地南－他到了福建，我在湖南住了兩年又掙扎着到北平去謀生路。五年中我受盡了社會冷酷的虐待，掙扎着養活三個孩子，他沒有帮助過我。他要我把孩子送到他的家鄕——浙江，交給他的七十多歲和六十多歲而且病着的父母去。我不忍心使三個這様幼小的孩子跟着兩個老人去受罪，我沒有這様做。去年，分從福建回到上海，我也從北平到了南京，他要我把孩子交给他。我只交給他一個。今年，他又到陜西去了，我從她口裏聽到她不肯帶我的孩子的話。而且事實給我證明，他的信也證明：他不需要許多的孩子了－他和她又有了兩個小孩－他也不愛我生的孩子了。</p>
<p>他是一個到處漂泊的窮文人，我是一個弱而又弱的弱女人，我將怎様付他呢？</p>
<p>爲了三個可憐的，不幸的幼小者，我想我是應該犧牲了自己的一切，來負起這個責任的；雖然我自己的能力是如此蔳弱，前途又是怎様地渺茫！我不能計較自己的苦難，我不希翼他的帮助；我只求人間眞正的同情，公理最後的批判。</p>
<p>我爲什麽最初不能拒絕他的要挾？在同居後感到生活的衝突，我爲什麽不能離開他？我爲什麽毅然帶着本個孩子回家去，深深地相信他而不懷疑他？我爲什麽不將小孩子交給他的父母？我爲什麽不能抛棄了孩子，還要代他負起這様困苦艱難的責任？</p>
<p>『你『太』好了』！這就是我從人間得到的唯一的的批判。人家說：『狠毒婦人心』，我恨我的心爲什麽不『狠』？爲什麽不『毒』？我　竟是個『弱者』！</p>
<p>有誰肯對我說：『你是對的』或『你是不對』嗎？</p>

<p>結婚－－這是多麽耐人尋味的名詞呵！</p>
<p>有人說『結婚是戀愛的墳地』，眞的，結婚的對於我，實在太苦痛，實在太無味。我是多麽的咀咒結婚的生活哟！她可以埋葬人們的靑春，她使得有失掉了勤奮心，她給與了人們以無限的凄痛，消極。至少，這對於我。</p>
<p>和他由友誼而戀愛，由戀愛而結婚，這其間是經過了足四年半的時間，我們明白了彼此的傾向，了解各的的脾氣，知道了有結合可能後，我俩便結了婚。</p>
<p>舉行儀式的那天，多少的友們在誇贊着美滿的姻緣。幾多的同學露着羡妬的眼光。的確的，我俩配合得多麽巧當呵，無論在學問上，技能上，程度資格上。</p>
<p>且看婚後的生活吧，我俩是那様深深的相愛，誰全不捨分開。不幸，分失掉了職業，每天的躱在家裏嘆氣。我曾用盡了方法安慰他，使他快樂，使他寛心。同時，辭去了娘姨，而代以自己操作。</p>
<p>他呢，自十三歲上失去了母親，爲了使他重嘗慈母的甜愛，我也曾代表過他母親般的愛於他，他常說：自婚後，幾忘去了母親，变不覺失去母愛的悲痛。　　有時，他像很煩惱，拿我來駡着，我深深瞭解他暴燥的脾氣，只是不嚮，雖然，苦涙是往肚中廻流。（未完）</p>

<p>三華爾斯頓</p>
<p>大在爭取婦女平權的先進戰士當中，華爾斯頓（Ｍａ	ｒｙＷｏｌｌｓｔｏｎｅ－ｃｒａｔｔ）女士也是個偉大人物之一。她是英國人，生於一七五九年，各顧瑪麗（見本刋上期）同一時代。顧瑪麗爲法國大革命時代婦女運動底天才的宣傳家和组織者；而華爾斯頓則是用筆尖爭取婦陈平權的作家。她在她著名的『擁護女權』一書中，銳利的筆鋒，激昻的措詞，對當時業已醒悟自由的英國女性，給了以很大的興奮。</p>
<p>華爾斯頓在舅幼年時代，極爲貧苦，她帮助母親，操持家務，丢棄了兒童的快樂。但因此她却養成了一種能力，就是在靑年時代她就竭力謀獨立的職業。她一步一步地由做小學校的敎師，訓育員，校長，以至踏入了著作的領域－主要的是敎育學的。</p>
<p>當時英國有一個政界要人，名呌柏爾克的，出了個小册子，汚衊法國革命，華爾斯頓女士便寫了『擁護人權』一書駁之。這可說是她熱烈地信奉法國大革命的信條。</p>
<p>華爾斯頓女士不僅敏於感覺政治的壓迫，而且敏於感覺窮人的困苦情形。她在『擁護人權』及其他作品中，憤激地攻擊　王，稱之爲『高居宮庭的沒有靈魂的傀儡：』她攻擊沒落的貴族，攻擊寄生的　侶，痛責常備軍的奴隸精神。她認爲社會罪惡的根源，是在社會分成了階級。她說，『貧困者，乃犯罪和賣淫之母親也。』『擁護人權』一著，使華爾斯頓的聲名大著，以致引起了反動勢力對她和痛恨。勇敢的華爾斯顿，是很堅定的；她不息地凝固她心中所領略的社會政治平等的觀念。她在努力研究和思維的結果，於一七九二年曾發表了『擁護女權』一書。她的識見，比康多塞更高遠更深刻。她認爲，允許女性享有完全平等的權利，不特是抽象的正義觀念之實現，而且是人格之最高發展和女性充分興盛之先决條件。她說，唯有政治經濟的解放，方可使婦女自由的去澈底解决本身所特有的任務。</p>
<p>華爾斯頓女士說，婦女不僅應當獲得同等的敎育，與男性的最高志向相聯合起來，而且應當獲得經濟上的獨立，解脫對男性的依賴。婦女賣淫或因窮困的壓迫而去結婚，都是萬不可允許的。</p>
<p>她說，婦女凡是喪失了政治權和和不注意整個社會利益的，必定不能獨立</p>
<p>，而成爲迷信的犧牲者，必定不會賢明的敎育子女。婦女的智能所領略的，比現在所有者應當多些，否則，婦女便不能成爲賢母。『婦女應當從政治和民權上的奴婢變爲賢明而自由的公民。試讓婦女如男性一様，享受一切敎育的幸福和管理國家，那時你將明瞭的看出，婦女隨着自己的解放而要如何的聰明，優秀了。</p>
<p>華爾斯頓女士？把閉塞於狹隘家庭而與世隔離的母性的利已愛情，呌做『獸性愛情。』她說，要訓練公民，先要有良好的女性公民。要使人民權利充實，須要婦女選舉自己的代表參與政治機關－國會，而不要不問政治，『聽從他人的專斷。』可是假使該國的全部行政制度是適合於專制政體的話，那末婦女還是不要悲嘆好。</p>
<p>『擁護女權』一書的大意，如上所述。</p>
<p>她在此書的結論中，還對女界樹立了一個偉大的任務，就是發展她們的被埋沒的才能和認識自己的力量。但是，她說，社會上若不樹立平等、不消滅閥閱的差别，不解放婦女的時候，則婦女是不會優秀起來。</p>

<h3 id="c275">上海市選舉制席的探討 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 公撲</p>
<p>關於上海市政選舉，記者會一再爲文有所論列，而納稅華人會第十三次代表大會又於十六日開會，本屆工部局華董委業巳選出，這次選舉情形，吾人雖已於報端約略窺見，但是這種選舉制度是否得當，想不明個中眞相者定多，爰再就市政選舉制度及上海市政選舉章程作一扼要的叙述·與上海市民商討一下。</p>
<p>民主政治爲政治上較良好制度，已爲一般政治學者所共認。代議制度則爲一種實現民主政治的方式，而代議制度又端賴選舉制度來表現，所以凡採用民主政體的國家，莫不重視選舉的方法。各先進國家對於選舉最初都有種種限制，如財産，年齡，敎育，納稅，性别等，後來逐步演進，降至今日，除年齡和敎育稍有限制外，均已實行普選制度。所謂普選制度，卽凡屬國人年齡滿廿一歲，居住滿幾個月（各國不同）能識字的市民，均得參加選舉，不再有財産納稅性别等的束縛。所以現在選舉人的資格，可以說是减至最低限度了，因爲不如此就不足充分表現民治精神。</p>
<p>選舉的方法有直接與間接之分，直接選舉用公民直接選舉他所欲選的人，間接選舉則由選舉人選出代表，再由代表去代表選舉，直接選舉多數適用於地域較小和人口較寡的市區，而間接選舉則恰巧相反。在選舉時又有所謂推選者，就是每次選舉先推出若干候選人，讓市民選擇投票，這種方法，不論直接的和間接的選舉都能適用，不過各國在辦法上稍有不同而已。它的好處就是使選民有所適從，不至漫無様凖的瞎摸投票。</p>
<p>市政選舉有的棌用分區制，有的不分區，投票則多用不記名的秘密投票。如用的是推選制度，選票就由政府印發選民塡就投匭，亦可由郵局寄出，總之，現代的選舉可以說是已日臻於普遍的，公平的，和便利的地步了。　　上海市特區（卽公共租界）選舉在最初我們華人是無選舉權的，工部局董事僅有外人，因爲一般西人都有一種謬見，以爲租界是外的所有，只有外人有權過問市政，但按諸法理，這種見解，殊屬錯誤。迄民國十七年始有華董之創舉，由三人增至五人，這種經過情形，已經在本刋討論過，無庸贅述，現在祇將華董選舉方法，加以論述。</p>
<p>上海華人選舉董事，祇有一部分纔有此種權利，選舉人和被選舉人都有一種嚴格限制的，選舉人的資格必須有下列三種之一：（一）執有房地産價在五百兩以上者：（二）年付房地捐十兩以者；（三）年付房租五百兩以上而付捐者。（以上所指之房地須在公共租界）被選舉人的資格則爲（一）年付房地捐在五十兩以上者，（二）年付房金一千二百兩以上而付捐者，除此兩種限止外，被選舉者還須居住界内五年以上。至於選舉的步驟，則採取間接制，初由有選舉權者组織纳討論稅華人會選舉代表，再由納稅人會代表選出各董委。由此觀之，上海特區選舉資格完全着重在納稅和資産之上，這種選舉制度，是稍有現代政治常識的人，未有不認爲遣憾的。『···苟行普選·恐不特我人·卽外人·當夢寐以求之。』（見十六日納稅華人會王曉籟氏演講）這種心理，確係事實。不過這個問题，目前尚還談不到，因爲現在我方納稅人的選舉董委，還要受外人方面的限制，不能與納稅西人一様的作平等選舉，遑論其他呢？所以今後的進行步驟，應積極的做喚起民衆，訓練民衆，根據現狀，不斷的力爭，以促其進步。　　尤有進者，卽根據事實，退一步說話，選舉旣以納稅爲標凖，則照理納稅人應有平等權利，不能因國籍的不同而有所歧視；中西市民應當在一道共同選舉代表。當然，就事實上講，民族界限是難免的，何况租界的市政一笛掌握在外人手裏，不同國界的選舉自難辦到，但是，華人在租界纳稅者之應有選舉權，不論任何抱有偏見的西人，現在已無反對的餘地，如此，卽使把華人外人，分開來選舉，各自選出代表，那也應當以中西人納稅總額來分配董事名額。華人納稅總額佔工部局稅收全部百分之五十五以上，所以代表名額起碼也應當在一半以上。但是現在如何呢？工部局西董九人，華董僅五人！　歐美各國是實現民主政體的先進國家，但在西人掌握下的上海市政，却有這種不合理的選舉制度，在中外選舉代表的名額又有如此不平等的待遇，記者對此，不但爲民主政體實施危，卽國際合作前途，亦暗伏有無從危機，實不容忽視者也。</p>

<p>— 李靑</p>
<p>秋天的風吹着，天氣爽朗得令人高興起來。在淡綠色的河裏，水慢慢的愉快的流。就在這個時候，我和兩位同學坐着船向××村去。我們是剛從中學裏出來的，我們正要到××村去敎書。還未經耹過人間的黑暗的我們，對這未來的職業抱着美滿的幻想。我們滿想去改造當前的敎育，滿想把學校和農村打成一片，我們心中隱藏着無限的熱力，好似燃燒着的火爐一様。</p>
<p>不用說，『粉筆行涯』不是快活的事兒。你每天要早的起床去領導學生們早操；你每天要絞腦汁，花精神和賣氣力去講七八小時的書；晚上你還要改許多寫得亂七八糟的練習薄。還有甲童打了乙童一拳，乙童哭着來告訴時，你便要發一回脾氣，打甲童幾下：甲童的母親又會來問你爲什麽打她的兒子····總之，你是小學敎師時，你便會一天辛苦到晚的，可是，在我和我的兩位同學是不在乎這些的，我們忍受着這一切。於是，我們就這様幹下去了。</p>
<p>我們着先就和學生們打成一片。在下了課的時候，和學生們一起玩。</p>
<p>『來，我們把×先生俘擄過來！』天眞爛漫的小朋友包圍住我，把我抬到他們的牢獄裏。</p>
<p>這様，我們和學生的感情非常的好。當然，上課的時候是很嚴肅的。我們對學生一方面『施之以恩』，另一方面『脅之以威』，理輔之以感情的敎化，把整個學校變成了樂園，弄到那些小朋友們連星期日也來學校。</p>
<p>接着，我們打破了這地方的男女的封建殘餘的傳統的觀念，消滅了學生間的男女的界限，到後來，竟至先生學生男生女生混在一起打籃球了。</p>
<p>我們帮助高級的和中級的出壁報陈我們還替低年級的出版一個圖畫壁報。只要看見無數的小人頭在壁報前擁擠着，睜着純潔的眼睛，嘴邊掛着鄕村的樸素的微笑在看着壁報時，我們就感動到不知怎様好，就愉快到笑不出來。</p>
<p>和這些純眞的兒童在一起，這是無上的快活。我和他們一起的去『大掃除』，一起的勞作，一起的種菜地，一起的去旅行···。</p>
<p>當夕陽紅似火的時候，我們常掮着鋤頭，和小朋友們到菜地去。經過一丘丘的田地，穿過幽靜的樹林，雀兒唱着</p>

<h3 id="c277">相對的思想界與新生活運動 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵民</p>
<p>在目前的思想界中，牠的變幻眞是層出不窮，最顯明的却是『摩登化』與『復古化』。新奇的怪癖的事情天天在那裏演出，但總逃不出這兩條路，這互相針對發展的二條路。　　中國思想界所以有這種現象的原因，是因爲中國社會的生産力不發展，使民族的生存發生恐慌，生産關係一方面是復古的手工業封建性，一方面却已是歐化的資本主義，這二條相對的經濟生活的道路，就反映出目前相對的思想界。</p>
<p>『摩登』的含意是什麽？簡單說一句，就是頽廢的肉慾主義。跳舞，運動，電影就是這主義表演的最主要方式，一切生活的中心，都把牠作耀目的標凖。大學中的男女，擁抱着走入跳舞塲，影戲院裏表演祼體跳舞就能賣滿座，衣服裝飾以女明星爲標凖，揭幕亦必請女明星，因此摩登女性亦學了女明星的『蕩』『熱』去招致男性。在男子一方面呢，他們熱心運動，一個摩登男性的畫像，就是穿着短褲，赤着雙臂，身上掛着許多奬章的一個充滿虚榮和肉感的人。於是男運動家與女明星結婚，便被人視爲最摩登的結合。</p>
<p>時代的趨勢如此，於是自命爲正人君子的人物，就高唱世風不古，這德淪亡的輓歌，想出許多舊方法去挽救牠，如提倡讀經運動，某人呈請當局恢復舊禮敎等等顯著的事實。</p>
<p>思想界走入二極端的形象，眞使一般靑年目迷五色了。走不通的呼聲，煩悶苦痛的呼聲，到處可以聽到，靑年因思想無出路而自殺的新聞亦時有所聞。此種現象，若仍聽其自然，終非黨國之福。</p>
<p>現在，我們勞苦功高的黨軍政諸公所提倡的『新生活運動』，就是要糾正這相對的思想界，消滅『摩登化』與『復古化』，以與民更始，乃民先導。凡我民衆，其各奮起，擁護『新生活運動』。</p>
<p>歌，和着我們『沙沙』的脚步聲，呵，這是多麽含有詩意，多麽偉大的自然啊！我陶醉了·····</p>
<p>『不要動！』前面的小朋友說。於是躡着遥躡着脚，輕輕的蹲在地上；在小小的白胖的手兒前面，停着一隻蝶兒。　　『哈哈！捉住了，是一隻鳳蝶。拿回去製標本吧！』</p>
<p>我們到了菜地，看着那些靑葱可愛的菜兒，啊！那就是我們的成績。</p>
<p>『×先生，我們要下些肥料啦。再過一星期可以吃了。』·······</p>
<p>這様的生活，過一輩子也不厭的！　　我們和農民也合得來。我們在忙碌中創辦了平民夜學，每晚都抽出兩點鐘的時候去敎夜學，帮助失學的人認字。我們把圖書館開放，讓村中的人來看報看書。我們遇有重要新聞的時候就出版『民衆壁報』，張貼到村裏的圍牆上去。</p>
<p>在晚上，農民有了空，聚在樹頭下談天。『去，去呌先生們給我們講講故事罷！』這様，露天的演講會又開始了。</p>
<p>我們還設了『民衆代筆處』和『民衆詢問處』兩部，替村中的人効勞。</p>
<p>『年紀靑靑的，眞是好人！』我們得到的是村民的誠懇的感謝。雖然很辛苦，但這種精神的安慰是甜蜜的。</p>
<p>好的生活是不能長久的。村中的土豪劣紳漸漸的不滿意我們了，因爲我們敎給農民許多新的智識，這是他們所不喜歡的。在我們鼓動學生毁了學校隔鄰的關帝廟的徧間做圖書館後，他們更露骨的反對我們了。這些土劣事事給我們製肘起來。他們散佈了關於我們的許多不中聽的流言。</p>
<p>我們要添置校具嗎？理財的回答：</p>
<p>『好，遲些罷，現在錢不方便。』</p>
<p>學生球隊去遠征，向校董會請求津貼，却得到了無理的駁斥，</p>
<p>總之，他們什麽都給我們搗蛋，他們使我們什麽都不能發展。終於，在這學期結果的時候，我們只好結束我們的敎師生活。</p>
<p>『×先生，你們不要走罷。你們走了，我們又要過着乾枯無味的生活，我們不再講書了！』小朋友們雖然這様的挽留我們。可是我們要走的日五終於到了。</p>
<p>『×先生，不要忘記我們！給我們寫點信！』當我們上了船的時候，在碼頭上送行的上朋友說。從瑩瑩的眼裏，在緋紅的面頰上，滴着亮晶晶的珠涙·······</p>
<p>風還是一様的吹着，水還是一様的流着，可是這是冬天的天氣了。我們熱烘烘的心上好似蓋上了一層薄冰。我們美麗的幻想變成泡影了。</p>
<h3 id="c278">四川的轎夫 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 季愚</p>
<p>『咯嘰咯嘰咯咯嘰兩個肩頭當馬騎』</p>
<p>這是四川的童話，而是轎夫們最不歡喜聽的話。記得糼小的時候，我有一回坐轎到外婆家去，路上不知怎地轎子顚播一下把我駭着了，我好像埋怨轎夫似地，隨口哼唱出這兩句話，轎夫聽了大惱火了，咒駡道：『這短命鬼才可惡！』</p>
<p>去年回到故鄕，再乘轎子時，遇到過偏偏和我横打麻煩的轎夫，可是，我再不忍哼這『肩頭當馬騎』和調兒了，雖然他們的生活實際上比騾馬還不如！</p>
<p>轎夫在四川，客氣點稱『營抬師』，惡毒些會痛心地被駡做『殺騾頭』的。因爲他們賣力氣的範圍不同，轎夫分爲：『長班』，『加班』跟『過街班』三種。</p>
<p>『長班』專門兜攬上長途的生意，他們自己製得有轎子，比方從我們×縣上成都，這三百六十里的長途，就得雇用他們。價錢購定後，當乘客起程的前一天，得給他們『打牙祭』－吃酒肉。上了路，食宿者歸抬轎的自備，乘轎人是不管的。路上他們每天得走八九十里崎嶇的山道，工錢平均每里可掙二百文－伙計俩平分。他們飯不敢喫飽－據說吃飽了抬了走着不不得勁。每頓只能喫一碗『帽兒頭』－碗碗飯。下泡酸菜，每天四五頓不等，每碗『帽兒頭』約需錢是四百文，每頓飯後得抽一兩灘，每灘五百文的大烟。『未晚先投宿，鷄鳴早看天，』棧房門口燈籠上這兩句格言，他們很能謹守毋違的。每當天色快要黑了的時候，好像後面有誰在鞭打似的，飛快地趕攏站口，給客人打好房間，把轎上的行李收拾進屋，件數點淸了，就去吃飯的吃飯，抽大烟的抽大烟，等棧房的憇客到得差不多，他們就搯出二百文請『么師』－棧房的伙計，給拿來一床破襤骯髒的被窩，各人拿去舖在乘客的門限外邊地下，或棧房櫃台的基角里，乾柴般地躺下去恢復他們成天的疲勞。第二天，東方剛一發白，馬上鑽出被窩來，收拾轎子，凖備重上他們連飯都吃不飽的征途。</p>
<p>『加班』就是一般所謂的『加班匠』，他們自己沒有轎子，每天一見亮就去蹲在大路旁邊的小店子裏－蜀這上每隔五六里有一小店子，賣烟，茶，『帽兒頭』等等。上長途的轎夫因爲抬疲倦了，趕不上站口，或者中途得病，－轎夫最易發痧症，肚子疼等病，就得找『加班』來替抬十里，八里。『加班』每里只能得一百五六十文，餘下的四五十文仍歸『長班』得。他們始終只在某叚路上抬來抬去，做『團轉』生意。生意好的時候，他們比『長班』掙還錢多。</p>
<p>『過街班』專在城裏抬生意，他們的轎子是從行裏貨來的。一經得着生意，價錢總比『長班』，『加班』來得高一點，每里掙四五百文不等。不過，年來經濟恐慌，無孔不入，四川的每一都市，也不免失業分子的激增，轎夫也就須得搶</p>

<h3 id="c279">服裝與社會生活 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 嵐</p>
<p>我們近日在報紙上常可以聽到提倡國貨的同胞反對穿西裝的聲浪與破壞西裝的消息。他們反對的理由，大致不外日前天虚我生君所云：『外國人到中國來傳敎，他們還穿我們中國的衣服，我們不到外國去做洋奴，又何必改穿西服呢？』</p>
<p>我雖不是個穿穿西服者，但我却覺得反對穿西服的人，不管是理論方面和方法方面都不免滑稽。我以爲提倡國貨與着西裝不是對立的。年麩湒絲織工業不振之原因，一方面是受了世界不景氣的影響；他方面是因爲（一）中國的關稅不能絕對自主，卽不能用關稅的壁壘阻止外國衣料特别是人造絲之輸入，（二）中國的絲織工業品不能改良，和（三）中國農村經濟之破産，减低了甚至破壞了農村的購買力。</p>
<p>假如我們的關稅能絕對自主，能阻止外國衣料之输入，國人縱改換穿西服，仍只能用國貨做材料，也不會有利益外流之事。中國的民族工業爲甚麽不積極起來督促政府向帝國主義奮鬥，實行保護貿易政策，反而津津於指責同胞不該穿西服，豈非咄咄怪事。</p>
<p>責駡穿西服者亡國奴，這如果可以作爲反對穿西服的理由的話，也只能適用於一部分人，卽適用於以穿西服爲高尚和光榮的人。假如拏這個理由來反對西裝的流行和一切穿西裝者却是不對的。</p>
<p>一般提倡中國服反對西服的人，他們最大的錯误，在於不了解服裝的式様與社會生活的關係。他們不知道，服裝的式様對於社會文化和生活是取着適應的態度，非人力可以隨便左右的。</p>
<p>舉例說吧，不論是中外的僧侶，何以總是穿着非常寛大而又拖長的衣服，而農民和工匠每每是穿着短衣的呢？這原因是在：僧侶是不勞而食的人，他們有時縱有所勞動，也只是精神的，而不是體力的。因此，他們穿的寛大而又拖長的衣服對他們不但無妨害，而且還能顯出特殊的神氣和威嚴來。至於農民和工匠們，他們都是體力勞動者，他們如果穿上僧侶的衣服，便完全不能勞作。因此，他們不能不穿短而緊束的衣服。</p>
<p>我們現在是處在二十世紀機械文明的時代。一切的生産是使用機器，一切的運输和交通是使用機器，乃至我人日常生活坐一臥，一舉一動都與機械文明有關。因此，我們的服裝對於這機械文明不能不取着適應態度，那千百萬的立於機器前面的工廠勞動者和那千百萬的每日與機器相周旋的工程師，司機者，汽車夫，輪船水手，他們應當十分留心他們的服裝形式對於他們的勞作環境之適應性，那是不消說的，就是一般自由職業者如醫生，職員，公司的跑街，甚至一般平常的居民，在這種工業文明社會中也不能不注意自已的服裝之輕便性的對社會生活之適應性。如果你穿中國長袍乘飛機，穿着中國的宮裝坐汽車，縱使你能小心謹愼，幸免生命之虞，你也必然會感覺到極大的妨碍與不便吧　　西式的服裝正是適應二十世紀機械文明社會的服裝。如果我們要注意服裝的輕便舒適，我們是不能不提倡西式服裝的，最低限度，我們是不應反對西式服裝的。</p>
<p>人們改變了自己周圍的環境，因此也改變自己以與環境相適應。我們由農對社會的改變到工業社會，我們必須改穿工業社會的衣物，恰同我們由農業社會改變到工業社會，必須改換我們政治制度一様。中國的長袍大袖式的衣物實說明數千年來中國的士大夫階級都是不勞而食者。此等衣物應與中國人的豚尾同命運，民無須煩言。而現在竟還有人在這二十世紀的機械文明社會中提倡中國服，反對西服，豈非呌人百思不得其解？</p>
<p>生意才成，不會搶的，就會成天沒人來光顧的。記行重慶有個轎夫訴苦說：每天難得掙得一元的，可是不管有無生意，轎行老板每天的五吊『賃錢』是非抽不行的，—四川每元換銅元十十吊。</p>
<p>他們每天所得的十幾吊錢，只够吃『帽兒頭』飯，吸鴉片烟－四川沒有不抽大烟的轎夫。着草鞋，憇棧房就不大够了，可是年來又發明了要抽轎夫的『轎槓捐』！要是說，轎夫也能有機會捐點特稅，敲一種格外『財喜』的話，那就在炎熱的夏季，女乘客不意地在坐板上留下一點兒月經红，那末他們至少得敲你三五吊的竹槓，要是她穿着漂亮一點的話。</p>

<p>— 沈一吾譯</p>
<p>當那一天下午我走過紐約的五馬路的時候，我就記起我有買一條硬領的必要。於是我就踏入了一爿廣貨店舖裏向那店夥說明要購買一條硬領。他就在盒子裏拿了一條出來給我看。</p>
<p>『這是最後的一條了，』他呼了一口氣。同時他手指着他的頸項上所加的硬領。這是的確不能加以否認的，那條硬領確是和他相同。</p>
<p>我眞的很中意這條硬領，就開口問牠的價錢。</p>
<p>『每條一元。』這是年靑店夥的回答，同時他打了一個呵欠。事實上，我因經濟能力薄弱，所以我雅不願購買一元錢一條的硬領。所以我就對那店夥說，請你換了一條價錢在二角五分的給我吧。剛說完了這一句話，那店夥就露出不高興的様子。</p>
<p>『啊···』他說，並且呈着苦笑相夾的一副臉色：『我們沒有這種硬領，我們從來不曾有這種貨色。』</p>
<p>『你將永買不到這様便宜的貨色在這五馬路的街上。』他加了說這句話之後，他就拿進了盒子，好像這椿事就完結了。我仔細推想起來，這種店夥實在太不知理了。他以爲我决買不到這二角五分的硬領，那眞是瞎話了。因爲我後來居然能買到，這眞是使他的店可以『閉門大吉』。</p>
<p>我又走到第二爿店去嘗試，那個店夥告訴我說，他們沒有再比七角五分便宜的硬領。但是，他對顧客的態度完全很和藹可親，而且對我很表示歉意。</p>
<p>『我們常見着一般顧客們被價格高所引誘，』他對我這様的解釋：『他們以爲好貨不賤，賤貨不好。這個觀念根本是錯誤了的。像這種價賤的硬領，儘有無數的白種華貴者在應用着。』</p>
<p>你聽了他這句話，也許以爲這個店夥太不懂得做生意的門檻了。其實不然，照我看來，他倒是的確一位有禮貌的推銷員，因爲他以和貌悅人，正呌我不得不出錢買了一條。</p>
<p>我堅信着某一大分店是已瀕於破産的了，雖說是在牠開設那年還是頗具聲譽於這全鎭裏。而且我還算定他之失敗的唯一理由在於『失衆』。他的店裏的各種貨色價目，雖都是合理而公道，然而因爲顧客買了他的椅子鬧鐘回家後，要想去調換一隻，於是那店夥們就深呈着一種與人難堪的神氣。他們常是查察貨物，而且說：『我不知道這事』以敷衍顧客們。</p>
<p>於是顧客們就恨恨地對自己這様說：『我希望我决不再踏進這種爲營利目的的商舖裏去了。』</p>
<p>有一個大雜貨商舖裏堅記着對顧客須表示謙和的信條。他們對於顧客們常說一聲：『謝謝你，下次再望光顧。』不論顧客們的脾氣怎麽不好，或者甚至無故的侮辱了店夥，他們也得默然認錯。舉個例子來說，店夥對於拒絕用劣幣或僞洋時該對顧客說了圓婉的言辭。倘若有一個顧客他付給了你一個鉛幣，你切不可加以咒駡，你應該帶着和婉的態度對他說：『現在市面上鉛幣多得很，先生不知在那裏混進了一塊····。』</p>
<p>由和氣而生財的，再沒有像旅館業那麽之驚奇的顯例了。首先實現了這個事實者當推之今虹之喬治潘爾德了。直到他的死時，他還被公認爲大旅人館業家。</p>
<p>『禮貌是世上最廉價之物，』潘爾德時常這様說：『但購之匪易，須化極大之代價。』</p>
<p>潘爾德堅持着的規條，就是認定顧客一定是對的。這條規條現在已廣被採用。舉個例來說：假使宴席上有一個客人因嘗了魚味不好就向待者說這魚已壞，那待者雖堅信這魚並未壞掉，然而切不可帶反向顧客：『壞在那裏？』的口氣。他必須趕快將魚盆搬去，很謙和的問顧客：『先生，我將調換了什麽菜來代替？』</p>
<p>潘爾德每天對旅客的有病者劃了名單在檯子上。假使是個重病者，他就立刻到他的房間裏去安慰他的病狀。如果是個女人，他還送了她一束鮮花。</p>
<p>像這種和謙態度的，還有一爿小雜貨店。我有一次向分買了一張明信片。我給他一塊鎳幣他就找我四分錢，並且還說一聲：『謝謝你』，觀彼之意好像這是一筆大生意者然。我問他何以這様客氣的理由，那經理替我解釋：『這是我們店規之一。我們對零買者並不厭棄。因爲用和悅的態度對他，使他下次再來。光顧。』</p>
<p>有許多公服務的公司像汽油和電燈公司之類，他們對顧客的不滿者時常對之以『你來幹麽』的一種神氣。不過在今日却完全改變了，他們店裏請了堅視者，專敎訓這般對待顧客不好的職員們。</p>
<p>每一個人都可追懚起數年前大公司索賬的不客氣的文句，於今日全者都改了。像這様的居多：</p>
<p>『···尊賬或因贵務繁冗所忘，茲特重提，希前久卽付是幸。』</p>
<p>影戲院也要這様。當一位婦人遲來已無客廳座位的時候，售票員切不可對她說，『樓下客滿了！』的失　句子。你應該很和謙地對她說：『太太　　有樓上的座位了，二元與二元半的價格。一因爲人們總歡喜聽和悅的說話，而不慣入耳於硬棚棚的言辭。</p>

<p>— 葛明</p>
<p>在聖誔節前，妻就問孩子們過年要　什麽衣服，預備給他們添製，六歲的女兒滬子一點不思索的答道，　我要一　　空服，我要　　　個女航空家。當時我們都笑了，我們竟聽了她的話替她定做了一身皮衣，還替她買了一架小飛機。</p>
<p>這孩子爲什麽會生出航空家的思想來呢？這不是無緣故的。第一，自然仍是好奇心。航空家能上天，上得天的人自然是非凡的人，她也常聽人說，在外國民有女航空家了，所以她也願做一個人上人。第二，自然是一二八　了她太可怕的影響了，雖然那時她還只有四歲，並不知道戰爭的恐怖，可是，戰爭的故事她是聽得很多的，她知道，日本的飛機比中國多，中國的空軍那次並沒有認眞同日本打，她覺得很憤慨，自已不能不做航空家了。第三，也要歸之於國内年來的航空空氣了，我們常常聽見有外國飛機而來華表演，天空中天天聽到　雜的機響，　　　　　自然也就加深了。</p>
<p>航空家的父母也不得不找此通俗的材料來，一面自己學習，一面給孩子們一些較正確的觀念，於是，我們的家庭常常有着航空的談話，並且有着一名武裝的小女航空家，和一架小飛機。</p>
<p>我的四弟是學造飛機的，聰說自己也能駕駛，可惜的是他遠在嶺南，不能常到我家裏來，然而在孩子們的心中　　　四叔自然要比父親强，他是個可崇拜的人，因爲要滿足孩子們的願望，所以最近四弟回到故鄉時，我第一次相見就把孩子們的相慕的話對他說了；並請他到我家作一次對孩子的航空演講。　　以下就是他同孩子們的對話。</p>
<p>『四叔！飛機怎麽能飛得起的？是誰想出來的呢？』</p>

<p>P&gt;優生與民族</p>
<p>— 陳天華</p>
<p>德國自希特勒執政後，整軍經武，勵精圖治，企圖挽回凡爾塞和約桎梏下的國運。最近又制定優生律，以期改良人種，俾有利於未來的世界大戰。據十五日哈瓦斯社電訊云：</p>
<p>『德國前曾頒佈優生律，禁止身體與弱　曾犯罪或有精神病者結婚，俾使不良之種，從此斬絕；而健全之族益增其强。令發之後，全國景從。現爲使此令之實施，益有嚴密之監督起見，對於全國醫師法官均將施以一種特别之敎育···撒克遜邦政府深信北方民族得天獨厚，從造物者所賦予之靈魂與肉體之價値而言，北方民族之成分爲『優良之成分』，故擬在特萊斯登城特設專研人種學與國民健康之研究院一所···』</p>
<p>優生學與民族衛生，本來是有關係的。動植物種子可以人工改良，人種自無不可改良之理。『選擇』的觀念不僅適用於自知界，亦適用於人類。而遺傳爲選擇之最要關鍵。自曼德爾的遺傳律出，知遺傳有數量的法則可循；自惠司曼之胚質論出，知道傳有物質的根柢可據。由此，優生成爲完全可能。明乎此，優生運動之爲民族主義者所提倡，也就很自然了。但德之優生律有可討論之處。身體孱弱不一定是先天的，後天的營養不良，疾病，常爲孱弱的最大原因。再說，孱弱並非絕對不可改造；果不可改造，則各種運動，競技，拳術又有何用呢？犯罪者未必一定係不健全者，况罪犯中也有絕頂聰明的人，而若輩犯罪的原因，又多半爲社會不良，經濟壓迫等。至於精神病者，雖大半神經不健全，但此輩得病之源後天者多，亦並非不可治愈，且患者中有極聰明的天才。若對於這些人，都斷絕他們的生殖機能，在人道人講是殘暴，在政治是講是對於民衆的一種壓迫，在民族利益上講是一種損失。</p>
<p>但希特勒的眼光是不同的。他相信『龍生龍，鳳生鳳，聰明健康的人生聰明健康的人。他想用他的優生律，把德國民族弄行强大。他是完全以國家的利益爲前提的。</p>
<p>我不反對優生學，但我不滿意這種畸形的優生學。我們與其提倡這種優生，倒不如提倡優境。第一，這種優生運動者每多觀念錯誤，視現社會之支配者爲適於生存之人類，認爲祇有社會上層人物宜於繁衍子孫，而大多數的人則反被漠視。優生學在此觀點上乃係一種貴族的科學。</p>
<p>第二，這種優生運動者乃戰爭之製造者。他們的提倡人種改良，乃在乎多得强壯的兵士，更有把握地去侵奪别的的土地，去征服殖民地。希特勒的厲行優生律，墨索里尼的鼓勵結婚，都可在這一意義上得到解釋的。</p>
<p>第三，我們與其努力人種改造，毋寗努力經濟改造。我們不能否認人類的生存權，我們更看出經濟改造比其他的努力，對於人類的貢獻更來得。我們把人類的環境改造好了，人類社會自然進步了，人種亦自然趨於進化之途。</p>
<p>在我國，殘餘的封建意識籠罩着社會，婚姻的門第觀念，貧富觀念，已寓有優生選擇的意思，倒好像是懂得優生的意義的。然而我們的民族仍是　頽淫靡的，眼見提倡優生必走入牛角尖裏，那末，我們還是努力改造民族的經濟環境的好。</p>

<p>然人也會學會的啊！現在的飛機，就是從飛鳥能『飛』這一點想出的，都是用一種特殊的方法，去操縱空氣，保證飛行。你們要知道，世間的一切發明家，都不是空想的，他們很細心的去觀察一切，爲了實用，於是得到發明。　如介殻蟲，蜂，蠅，蝙蝠和鳥都是人類的先生。他們是最早的航空家，人類從他們飛行中，學得了『人爲的飛行』術，這是很平常的。』</p>
<p>『鳥的身子是輕的喲！飛機那麽笨重的東西什麽能飛，我實在不懂？』　　『哈哈！你以爲輕的東西就能飛麽？那螞蟻比鳥身子輕，百節蟲比甲殻蟲身子輕，爲什麽又不能飛呢？恰恰相反。重量是飛行必需的條件，凡能飛的東西，必比空氣甚重。如果鳥輕於空氣而飛，那麽大風一吹，鳥就會被吹到不知什麽地方去了。她那能來回自如呢？你懂了麽？』</p>
<p>『我還是不懂，比空氣重的東西多着啊！爲什麽又不能飛呢？』</p>
<p>『我說，重量只是一個條件，重量以外還要有適當的飛行器官與力量。鳥類有重量，有構造適當的飛行器，又能發出適當的動　來與空氣相　　，故　飛。飛機也是一様，如果沒有適當的配合，是不能飛起的。鳥類的表面天然的減到極小，但在必要時由翼的振動去增加其主動面。翼在劇速振動時，把它所經行的空間，變爲支起身體的强固根據地。翼振動的速度要比任何風吹的速度高，這様，它才能駕馭風而能在風中任何方向飛行。我們不是常常看見在大風中鳥的翼總是不斷的振動，在雲淡風淸的蒼空的老鷹，只張着翼子，懶得振動，就是這個緣故。不過，鳥類的飛行器官是活動的翼，人類現在改用了螺旋槳了。它的目的同是攻擊和屈服空氣，而不爲空氣所攻擊和屈服。』</p>
<p>『四叔，飛機爲什麽能倒轉飛，傾斜的飛呢？』</p>
<p>『這也同行船必需傾斜一様，是在駕馭空氣。翼在空氣中振動猶如搖船的槳在水中一様。『翼向下拍的時候向下向前打，在向上拍的時候向上向前打，在家空氣中畫一『８』字形的軌跡。』飛機也採用了這條原理。』</p>
<p>孩子正聽得津津有味，郤被晚餐所打斷了。這一次的演講，使孩子更親近了鳥類。</p>

<p>— 凡夫</p>
<p>雖則說是世界經濟恐慌依然深化下去，可是當我們回顧一九三三年世界經濟的各種統計的時候，事實却又有些不盡然的様子。謂予不信，請看：</p>
<p>一九三三年工業生産指數表</p>
<p>一九三二年一九三三年</p>
<p>美國五七·七六九·三</p>
<p>英國八八·四九一·七（七八九月平均）德國六一·二六八·六法國七五·六八四·六日本一○七·九一三九·四（十一月）　　工業生産指數，是一般經濟學者用來作爲景氣的指南針的。如果生産指數高，那意思便是産業發達，經濟繁榮，因而就形成爲影氣。相反，如果生産指數比以前低，那便意味着生産蕭條，經濟涸竭，因而就形成不景氣。上面的生産指數表是以一九二八年的生産指數爲基凖而算出的。據該表看來，一九三三年美英德法日這五個主要的資本主義國的生産指數，都比前一年的指數爲高，於是有些經濟學家便興高彩烈地嚷道：『不景氣就要過去了，景氣快要再來了。』</p>
<p>不但是生産指數表示着好轉的希望，同時在各國的物價方面，也同様表示着上漲的趨勢。看吧：</p>
<p>一九三三年物價指數表（躉賣）</p>
<p>一九三二年一九三三年</p>
<p>美國九二九四*</p>
<p>英國八六八六德國九六九三法國八三七九（十二月）日本一二一一三五　　物價和生産指數一样，也是被人們當作景氣的指南針看待的。物價比以前跌。就表示生産過剩，社會消費力减縮，因而是不景氣；物價比以前，便表示社會需要增加，因而是景氣之徵。上面的物價指數表是以大戰前一年的一九一三年爲基凖的。這個表告訴我們，主要資本主義國的物價幾乎都是一齊向上漲。因此，樂觀的經濟學者們又喊道：『現在世界經濟已經由不景氣走到呆滯的階段了。』呆滯過後，便是景氣。</p>
<p>可是，世界的不景氣眞的已經過去了嗎？在這裏我們不得不加以冷靜的考察。</p>
<p>首先就生産的膨脹來說。一九三三年全年的平均指數固然比較三二年爲高。然而這種高漲却是異常波動的。三三年上半期各主要資本主義國的生産指數·幾乎都是一致地上昇，可是一到了六月，各國的生産指數便又開始往下降了。日本最早（六月），其次是法國（七月），其次是美國（八月），再其次是德國（九月）。</p>
<p>這充分地證明，一九三三年生産的膨脹，只不過是暫時的膨脹而已。這種膨脹完全是由各國政府用人爲的政策所剌激而起，一到了相當的時候，他終於還要把他的本色暴露出來的。</p>
<p>事實上，如果把這塊『生産膨脹』的招牌揭開，而去留心一下失業者人數的繼續增加與夫勞動者工資的繼續减少，那我們就可以斷定這種生産的膨脹是絕不會持久的。</p>
<p>現在再把物價之變態的高漲分析一下。各國物價之抬高，也完全是由於各國政府的『物價回復策』而來。在這種政策之下，首先是把關稅提高或則禁止外貨输入，以便形成國内商品的獨占價格。除去這個方法之外，再利用種種的貨幣政策，如停止金兌換，金元貶値等等來把名義的物價抬高。在物價指數表内，英美日的高價便是由此而來的。德法因爲沒有减低幣價，所以物價便表示跌落了。所以物價指數这增高，结局不過是各國政府的幻術而已。</p>
<p>世界的不景氣不但沒有過去，反而因爲這種假相的生産膨脹，假相的物價騰貴而日益加深。在生産膨脹的反面是：生産過剩，軍需品之累積等等；在物價騰貴的反面是：國際商品戰，國際貨幣戰之愈益尖銳。從經濟戰轉變而爲武力戰恐怕終於是不能避免的吧！</p>

<h3 id="c284">無綫電發明者馬可尼（三） <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 森然</p>
<p>馬可尼的研究日益進步，在一八九七年七月，他便離開了普里士之手，設立了百萬元資本的馬可尼無綫電公司，並請弗萊閔（Ｊ·Ａ·Ｆｌｅｍｕｎｇ）爲顧問。一八九八年，他又被命設立了哇依特島與布雷毛斯之間的無綫電信送受所，這兩處的距離是十二哩。同年八月，在病中的英國皇太子（ＴｈｅＰｒｏｎｃｏｏｆＷａｌｅｓ）與維多利亞女皇之間就常常靠無綫電信來通信，馬可尼便是他們通信的負責人，這是曾引起了當時英國國民之最大注意的。</p>
<p>維多利亞女皇與皇太子的那個無綫電通信，其距離有三○哩之長，馬可尼在此的成功，可以說是他在發明無綫電過程中的一個飛躍的進步。在這個無綫電的裝置中，有高一○五呎的立在海岸的Ａｎｔｅｎｎａ柱，有長八三呎的Ａｎｔｅｎｎａ，這在當時看來，不能不說是一件驚奇的創舉了。</p>
<p>正在這時候，人們舉行着一個划船比賽。但是，這比賽的决勝點是定在二十哩外的海洋中的，乘船去看的人自然可以馬上得知勝負的消息，但在岸上的觀衆便須等到船轉回來才能知道了。這時那些具着狂熱情緒的觀衆，當然是不很痛快的。於是，有一個新聞社就乘機去利用馬可尼的無綫電。於是，二十英哩以外的决勝的消息，馬上就可由無綫電傳到。於是，狂熱的觀衆的不痛快的感覺便一下消滅了。－－這便是將無綫電拿來普通應用的第一次，也就是馬可尼的聲名哄動英國的開始。</p>
<p>一八九九年，由法國政府的要求，馬可尼從事於英法越英倫海峽的通信之實騐了。他在英國的多瓦與法國的維墨羅兩處，各竪立起一五○呎高的Ａｎｔｅｎｎａ，使用一二千米突的波長。結果是獲得了大成功，横斷英倫海峽的無缐電通信實現了。於是海上的船舶與海岸的船舶相互間迅速的通信便有了日益實用化的機運。當時已經有了　備有無綫電裝置的燈船，救助在濃霧中觸礁的汽船的事情，這便是一個實例。</p>
<p>馬可尼海上通信的最有興味，最完全的實騐，是在英國海軍演習的時候。因爲演習必要無線電信，所以馬可尼便捉住了這個機會，努力他的工作。在一年的秋天英國海軍實行大演習中，他卽成功了歐羅巴號與覺羅號兩艦之間相隔六○浬的通信。其後，英國海軍還不斷地付給了他的權利金二十萬元，因爲要使用他所發明的無綫電。</p>
<p>一八九九年，南阿戰爭爆發了，馬可尼的助手併也到了戰地，馬可尼的無綫電在一九○○年一月竟救出了南阿包圍軍的孤立狀態。這便是無綫電在軍事上顯示牠的威力的第一次。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan's Ambition to Dominate East Asia Promotes Unity Between Britain and the United States. The Sacred Treaties Must Not Be Violated. The American Ambassador to the United Kingdom Discusses Countermeasures. The British Conservative Party Seeks Only to Maintain Commercial Interests. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(London) The American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Bingham, met with Foreign Secretary Simon today to discuss the declaration issued by Tokyo regarding Japan's "special position" in China. It is reported that their discussions concerned the general situation of this issue, but due to a lack of concrete reports, they were unable to agree on the actions to be taken. It is said that a further meeting will be held after more detailed information is received. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to official sources today, government officials welcome cooperation between Britain and the United States to reject Japan's control over China's diplomacy. It is said that, viewed in the current situation, cooperation between the two countries must wait for public opinion in both countries to develop to a considerable extent, or for Britain to contact the United States due to its commercial interests in China, before it can begin. The State Department is still studying the statement issued by Tokyo, but has not yet made a formal criticism because it has not yet received an official document from the Japanese government. However, the situation is greatly promoting the unity of opinion between Britain and the United States on the Far East, to a greater extent than at any time since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph stated today that the British Embassy in Japan has telegraphed to London the original text of Japan's declaration prohibiting other countries from interfering in Chinese affairs, along with newspaper criticisms. Washington has not yet contacted London, but may do so in the near future. If this happens, the initiator will clearly be the United States, not Britain, nor the League of Nations. What Britain is most concerned with is commerce, not politics. (Reuters Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Officials here stated today that Britain does not want to be subdued by Japan's new policy of rejecting assistance to China from other countries. According to the Associated Press, citing official sources, the British government is determined to uphold all treaties related to China and will reject any attempt to violate them. The most important of these treaties is the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees that no signatory country will seek a sphere of influence in China or monopolize Chinese rights. The second is the Four-Power Consortium Agreement of 1920, which stipulates that the four countries will jointly discuss requests for new investments in China. According to official opinion, the British government does not want to protest to Japan about the declaration issued by Tokyo, nor does it want to hold formal consultations with other governments, but will wait for a period of testing, at which time Britain will state its position. In the days since Japan issued its statement, British officials have not exchanged views with representatives of other countries. The Foreign Office received yesterday from the Ambassador to Japan the official gazette regarding the new policy. British newspapers consider this new policy to be Japan's Monroe Doctrine. Cabinet ministers, after receiving the report, immediately studied it and plan to submit it for discussion at the next cabinet meeting. Nervous newspapers view Japan's statement as a serious threat, but conservative newspapers view it as Japan releasing a trial balloon to test the intentions of other countries in the Far East.

<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian's editorial today supports Lord Cecil's statement that the League of Nations should clearly warn Japan not to touch China, otherwise the League of Nations will take action against Japan. The newspaper said that the mistakes of 1931 and 1932 should not be repeated. The best opportunity for the powers to combine groups inside and outside Geneva is now. We missed the opportunity to sincerely cooperate with the United States in 1932. What Britain and the United States want is only for China to enjoy independence, prosperity and strength. Opportunities for cooperation should not be missed again and again. (Reuters Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>(Washington) American officials are still unwilling to criticize Japan's declaration regarding its position in the Far East, but Senator King has officially expressed his opinion today. King said that Japan's move is condemnable and a blatant attempt to disrupt peace in the East and the world. He expressed disappointment at the path Japan has taken. He will soon express his views in the Senate. He hopes that Japan will return to the path of peace as soon as possible and sincerely cooperate with all countries to promote world harmony.

<p>(Paris) After the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Minister to France, told a reporter from the World News Agency that the statement issued by Tokyo regarding China actually reveals Japan's aggressive policy of seeking to expand into the Asian continent, especially its ambition to expand into China, which is even more obvious, and confirms its attempt to undermine China's sovereignty and exclude other powers from all the natural resources of East Asia, as well as the interests of the Chinese market. This policy is contrary to the main purpose of peace in the Far East. The Chinese people are well aware of the rights and obligations of independent sovereign countries and can never agree with Japan's doctrine of monopolizing sovereignty in Asia, and other powers will never accept it under its coercion. If peace in the Far East is to be guaranteed, Japan must abandon its brutal imperialist aggression and abide by treaty obligations. All French newspapers published Dr. Gu's remarks.

<p>(London) The Chinese Embassy in London issued a statement today, saying that Japan's declaration is nothing more than a reiteration of Japan's traditional policy of aggression on the Asian continent. Japan's policy is incompatible with the promotion of peace and order in the Far East. The Chinese people are well aware of the rights and obligations of their independent sovereign country and will never recognize Japan's unfounded doctrine of hegemony in Asia.

<p>(London) On the 17th of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an informal statement, resolutely opposing international assistance to China. On the 18th, it made a stronger statement to newspaper reporters, saying that if international cooperation assists China, Japan will take active action to oppose it, even resorting to force. After these two declarations were issued, public opinion in various countries was greatly shocked. The spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in view of the great repercussions caused by the two declarations, issued a third declaration this morning to explain them. The last paragraph stated that Japan had no intention of violating the open door and equal opportunity policy, nor did it intend to infringe upon existing treaties. Officials in London said that the first statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs seemed to be a warning to the powers, but its third declaration, which stated that Japan had no intention of violating the open door policy, seemed to reduce the weight of the first declaration. London and Washington have not yet exchanged views on this matter. People here believe that Japan's first declaration seems to be opposed to the American loan of cotton and wheat to China and the League of Nations' technical cooperation plan, but some people in the government also said that the third declaration has reduced the weight of the first declaration. It is generally believed that the House of Commons will definitely discuss this matter. (Havas Telegram of the 20th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian government views Japan's ultimatum rejecting assistance to China from various countries as having great significance for world peace. Although the Diplomatic Committee has not yet received the official document from Tokyo, it has not yet issued a formal criticism, but the Soviet Russian official newspaper has devoted much space to this matter. All Soviet Russian newspapers are subject to government inspection, so this point can represent the government's view. According to the official newspaper of the Russian government, Japan intends to act as the dictator of the Far East. It also stated that Japan has given us a declaration of hidden iron fists and intends to monopolize the invasion of China, and regards Japan's declaration as another section of continuous action, that is, to hope to establish hegemony in the Far East. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Since the news of the changing Sino-Japanese relations arrived here after the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, most Soviet Russian newspapers have remained silent. However, the "Pravda" newspaper published a headline on its front page yesterday stating, "Japan Tears Up the Nine-Power Treaty, Japan's Imperialist Aggression Program is Fully Exposed, All of China Will Become a Japanese Colony." This headline is enough to represent the general public opinion of Soviet Russia. (World Telegraph Agency Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>(London) When asked for his opinion by a former British representative to the League of Nations, Lord Cecil, Cecil replied, "The League of Nations was unable to stop Japan from seizing Manchuria. The League of Nations' incompetence has contributed to Japan's current hard-line policy. This is an inevitable result. Japanese politics have long been controlled by warlords, whose intention is to conquer China, or even to conquer all of Asia. If I were in power, I would immediately contact the United States government to take concerted action. This is the only way at present." (Havas Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Cecil told a reporter from the China Press today that Japan's declaration regarding its policy towards China is the inevitable result of the League of Nations' failure to prevent Japan from seizing Manchuria. The warlords who control Japan, now seeing that various countries in the world are too busy with urgent events to be distracted, are taking this opportunity, just as they did in 1915 when they made the Twenty-One Demands. Japan is encountering difficulties not only in Manchuria, but also has many difficulties within the country, so it is creating events that shock foreigners to divert the attention of the people. This is a common technique when any government has difficulties with its own people. If China can strengthen itself and develop well, as it is doing today with the assistance of League of Nations advisors, it can become a major opponent of Japan. Japan is determined to occupy a position in China that allows China to develop only as Japan wishes. There is only one thing to do now, that is, the League of Nations should clearly and plainly tell Japan that if Japan touches China, the League of Nations will take steps to deal with it without delay. Lord Cecil finally said that he believed that the problems caused by Japan's population expansion should be resolved with international consent. Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations was a miscalculation, because the League of Nations is the only international organization that can assist Japan.

<p>(Tokyo) According to reports, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the statement on the 17th has greatly agitated various countries, and the attitude of all sectors of the United States has become particularly hardened. He secretly telegraphed Ambassador Saito yesterday, instructing him to explain the statement to the American government and the press to ease the anti-Japanese atmosphere. (China United Press Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, declared yesterday that he would notify Secretary of State Hull of the instructions from the Japanese government to Minister to China Ariyoshi. Saito also stated that the Japanese government has not protested against the two aspects of the United States selling aircraft to China and China using Americans to train pilots. (Havas Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, announced today that he would visit the State Department to submit an accurate copy of the declaration on China issued by the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>(Geneva) League of Nations officials attach great importance to Japan's declaration, especially to the League of Nations' assistance to China's construction. The League of Nations has not yet received the official document of Japan's new policy, but the Special Committee dealing with the non-recognition of "Manchukuo" will study the matter when it meets on May 14 and will openly discuss the Far East issue. After receiving instructions from his government, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland, Hu Shize, went to Paris today to meet with Gu Weijun, the Chinese Minister to France. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The reason why the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly issued alarming declarations against international assistance to China may be found at the League of Nations headquarters here. After the League of Nations Executive Council passed the Lytton Commission Report in February 1933, it appointed a committee to be responsible for international technical cooperation with China. This committee will meet in Geneva on May 15 this year to take important decisions. In view of this, we can suddenly realize why Japan has adopted such an attitude towards China.

<p>(Geneva) The Japanese Consul in Geneva, Yokoyama, specially met with the Associated Press reporter today to continue to clarify Japan's position on international aid to China. According to the Japanese Consul, judging from the internal difficulties of the League of Nations, some countries may use the League of Nations' aid to China to consolidate their position. If aid is used as a tool for political struggle, the danger is very great. He hopes that Rajchman did not achieve any political propositions when he was in China. If Rajchman returns to Geneva with all the plans for aiding China, the League of Nations must also be cautious, because Japan is extremely willing to maintain the tranquility of the Far East. Dr. Rajchman was sent to China by the League of Nations last year to assist the Chinese Economic Conference in deciding on a construction plan. Rajchman is now on his way back to Europe. His mission is to bridge the gap between China and the League of Nations. The League of Nations, at the request of General Chiang Kai-shek and Finance Minister Song Ziwen, began its technical cooperation with China in May 1931. Rajchman's dispatch to China was at the time when the League of Nations decided to carry out reforms in China's transportation, finance, education, and health. If China is modernized and the whole country can unite, and there are vast resources that can be used to resist future foreign aggression, many Geneva officials hold this view. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yokoyama, the Japanese representative to the Disarmament Conference and Consul General in Geneva, recently explained to the Japanese government's current attitude towards China and the powers to the local office representative, saying that the Japanese government has been facing a lack of normal relations between the two neighboring countries due to China's failure to recognize "Manchukuo" and its rejection of through-traffic, postal service, establishment of customs, and recruitment of workers. Therefore, the situation created in North China cannot be ignored. Therefore, the Japanese government must issue serious warnings to the leaders of China. As for the various powers, we must tell them sincerely that, whether towards China or towards the various powers, we have no bad intentions. What we want to offer China is only spiritual assistance, and to enable China to develop in work and peace, reversing what it is doing now. We have no territorial ambition for any part of China. In addition, the initial intention of some of the various powers' ideas for China was undoubtedly altruistic, but the result often went against their wishes, leading to danger. We sincerely hope to make the powers understand this. We also never want to hinder China's open-door policy. We recognize the rights of various countries to trade, reside, conclude commercial treaties, and borrow money in China, but we very much hope that the powers will recognize Japan's expertise in Chinese affairs. All political mistakes and careless actions are most harmful to Japan. The world should know that any country or international organization (such as the League of Nations) that provides China with material and financial assistance without careful consideration will result in some Chinese parties using this assistance to oppose us. If this is understood, then our slight suspicion of international aid to China should not be surprising. For this reason, we do not need to ask the powers and the League of Nations (we are no longer a member of the League of Nations) to solicit our opinions. What we hope is that in the future, all creations regarding China should pay attention to Japan's special interests. (Havas Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The New York Tribune claims that, according to reliable sources in Tokyo, the statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had the tacit consent of Chinese government leaders before it was issued. The government was shocked by this. The External Affairs Officer said that the news was absurd and unfounded. Our government knew nothing about the content of the statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs beforehand. How could we acquiesce? Moreover, the content of the statement is tantamount to placing China under Japanese protection. The government, unless insane, would not acquiesce to it, damaging the nation's lifeline. The news originated from Tokyo, and it is very clear that it is a deliberate propaganda to deceive the world. Fortunately, various countries have a deep understanding of Japan's statement this time and will not lightly believe the rumors released from Tokyo. (Special Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an informal statement on the 17th, opposing international technical cooperation with us. All sectors of various countries have criticized it. According to sources from the Economic Committee, our country's cooperation with the League of Nations is based on the League of Nations' resolution last year, which clearly states technical cooperation, which does not belong to the political category. The League of Nations has also cooperated with European and American countries in the past, and there are many precedents. It is deeply regrettable that the Japanese have made this statement. Our country is an independent country and a member of the League of Nations. We cannot stop technical cooperation because of Japan's opposition, and we will further cooperate to the end forever. What can Japan do to us? (Special Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Pleading for the Sake of Prisoners Across the Country <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Old-style prisons in our country are dark and sunless. Those who are unfortunately imprisoned have all their joys of life extinguished. There is no hope for reform. Since the suggestion of reform in the late Qing Dynasty and the establishment of new prisons, many years have passed, but the results are still few. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, excluding the four northeastern provinces, there were a total of 451 old-style prisons in the country, and only 33 new-style prisons, which is less than 7% of the total. Due to the bankruptcy of rural areas, the people's livelihood is haggard, and they are plagued by hunger and cold. Shame and morality are lost, and crimes are committed more and more every day. Therefore, all prisons in various places are overcrowded, especially in the flourishing cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Hebei. Old-style prison cells are often narrow, dirty, and filthy. Medical equipment is even more simple and crude. Among the prison officials, those who are heartless are still wreaking havoc and bullying the weak, such as deducting prisoners' rations and extorting bribes. Numerous examples are reported.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate long-standing abuses, the judicial and administrative authorities have promulgated regulations and decrees one after another, such as the "Plan to Expand Prisons During the Period of Political Tutelage" in the 18th year of the Republic of China, the "Regulations of the County Prison Coordination Committee" in April of the 20th year, the "Prison Officer Training Rules" and the "Prison Affairs Research Institute Regulations" in the 21st year, and so on. However, the number of new prisons added in various provinces is still very few. According to the reform plan announced by the judicial and administrative authorities, 264 new-style prisons should be established nationwide during the period of political tutelage (including 47 juvenile prisons, 174 ordinary prisons, 22 recidivist prisons, and 21 prisons for patients with lung disease and mental illness), and 1,815 new-style detention centers. The difference between reality and ideal is like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Financial difficulties are hindering all reform plans. Even last winter, when the weather was severely cold in this city, the Jiangsu Second Prison, which is known as a model prison, had 2,600 male and female prisoners, 80-90% of whom did not have adequate clothing and bedding, and were unable to produce more due to financial exhaustion. They had to beg the charitable organizations for help and relief. By analogy, the suffering of other prisons can be imagined. According to a report by Prison Commissioner Gao Yihan, there were also plans to rebuild new prisons in Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, and other counties in Jiangsu Province. However, the provincial government and the High Court did not allocate funds, and only ordered the county magistrates to raise funds themselves, so that year after year, there was no way to start. Building new prisons or repairing old prisons is related to the lives of prisoners and the dignity of the country. It is within the scope of national construction, and we cannot continue to shirk responsibility due to insufficient funds. In recent years, the situation in prisons in Shandong Province has improved significantly. The new prisons in Yantai, Penglai, and Weihai have been properly managed. The Ministry of Law sent personnel to inspect them and considered them to be the best in North China. Shandong Province is not rich, but its achievements are particularly outstanding, which shows that it depends on human effort.</p>
<p>However, due to prison overcrowding, building new prisons is not as good as stabilizing the people's livelihood and reducing crime. As the old saying goes, "Suppressing boiling water is not as good as removing the firewood from under the pot." That is what it means. However, this matter is of great importance and should start with thoroughly clarifying politics, which is not what this article wants to say. For the time being, within the scope of justice, we will focus on the urgent matters that should be implemented and make a summary to plead for the sake of prisoners across the country. (1) The central government should quickly raise funds for the Ministry of Justice and Administration and use them specifically for adding new prisons and improving old prisons. (2) Local authorities should do their best to assist the central government and actively improve prison facilities and the treatment of prisoners within the possible scope. (3) Actively implement the doctrine of reform and teach prisoners handicrafts and vocational skills to prevent them from being forced by livelihood to repeat their crimes after being released from prison. (4) The courts should continue to vigorously implement the systems of probation, parole, and community service, and correct the long-standing abuses of slow handling of cases and detention without trial, so that imprisoned criminals can be released from prison early and free up vacancies for adjustment. (5) The Ministry of Justice and Administration previously planned to build an outside labor prison in Ningxia Zhan'en Canal to move prisoners to cultivate land. Later, there was a saying that the pilot program would be carried out first in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. This matter is not objectionable in principle and should be promoted. However, the selection and management of prisoners still needs to be carefully considered.</p>
<p>The Book of Documents says, "Abolishing punishment with punishment," and "Hoping for a world without punishment." I hope that the authorities in charge will keep this in mind, so that the prisoners who have been trapped in the hell on earth may one day see the light again.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the Chinese government has the sincerity to solve the North China problem. After Minister Ariyoshi returns home, a comprehensive consultation will be held to seek a solution. There are many pending issues between China and Japan, such as tariff issues, etc. However, since the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, the Chinese government has been cooperating technically with the League of Nations and various countries or borrowing foreign debts. In this situation, Japan believes that this kind of action hinders the peace of East Asia. In the future, Japan will stand on its own unique views and adopt a positive policy towards China so that other countries and the League of Nations have no room to intervene. Therefore, after Ariyoshi and the returning Ariyoshi agree on it, the issue will not be considered solved simply because the North China problem is resolved concretely. Foreign Minister Hirota will also personally show the policy that Japan will take a guiding position over China. (China United Press News)</p>

<p>(London) A Tokyo correspondent for the Daily Mail visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry today. According to a spokesperson from the ministry, Japan's position in the Far East must be clarified at the next disarmament conference. We are the only country capable of maintaining peace in the Far East, due to geographical and other reasons, which need no explanation. Any assistance given to China, whether financial or technical, will ultimately be detrimental to us, so such actions are very dangerous. Japan is willing to reach a clear understanding with Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia has repeatedly proposed a non-aggression pact, which Japan has not agreed to. Japan now wishes to form a committee with representatives from both countries, plus representatives from 'Manchukuo', to handle border issues instead, as this is the best way to maintain friendly relations. Soviet Russia is currently massing a large army on the 'Manchukuo' border and behind it, which is causing Japan great concern. There is no reason for Soviet Russia to take this step. It is reported that at least 115,000 troops and 5-600 aircraft are stationed near Vladivostok, in addition to tanks and submarines. The spokesperson concluded by saying that Japan would be happy to extend the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth to the 'Manchukuo' border. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Kaiser Wilhelm II's 'Lost Conversation': Once Advocated German-American Alliance Against Japan, Revisiting an Incident from 1908, Harboring Intent to Annihilate Japan, Viewing England as a Traitor to the White Race <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Boston: Mr. Harry is now publishing Kaiser Wilhelm II's 'Lost Conversation' with his father in 1908, at the height of his power. At that time, Wilhelm II advocated a German-American alliance to deal with the emerging Japan in Asia. This famous conversation will be published in the May issue of the Atlantic Monthly. The Associated Press has obtained the contents of this valuable and famous conversation from the magazine, and a summary is as follows: In 1905, when Wilhelm II heard that Russia had been defeated by Japan, he was deeply saddened. He sighed and said, "I wish my ships could have the opportunity to fight Japan, but this would be effortless. We must never allow China and Japan to unite, and we must never allow Japan to annex China. This is the special mission of our white race today. We don't need to talk about Britain, because England is a traitor to the white race." The conversation was too revealing, so the German Foreign Ministry did not allow it to be published publicly, but submitted a reviewed draft to Century Magazine for publication. However, it was withdrawn before publication. The world became aware of this conversation. For twenty-six years, publishers have repeatedly tried to obtain this manuscript, but have failed. Therefore, this 'Lost Conversation' has become a famous manuscript with significant historical value. In this conversation, Wilhelm II also said, "Everyone knows that there will be a conflict between the yellow race and the white race one day. If we forget our sacred duty and fail to preserve our inherent civilization and the religion given to us by God, then we will have no face to face our ancestors. We all know that the Japanese hate the white race even more than the white race hates demons. The Japanese are demons. This is a straightforward statement." He then talked about the results of his several meetings with former U.S. President Roosevelt. Wilhelm II said, "There will be a day when the world will realize what our transatlantic neighbors think when they read the joint German-American declaration to protect China's sovereignty. In my observation, the future of the world will belong to the Anglo-Teutonic nations of Northern Europe, and you Americans are also of this nation." (National Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) According to statistics released today by the Moscow Narodny Bank, Soviet Russia's purchases of goods from the United Kingdom this year have increased compared to last year. The total value of Soviet Russia's purchases from the UK in March this year increased sixfold compared to the same month last year, totaling approximately £907,688. The total value of Russian purchases from the UK in the first three months of this year was £2,260,317, compared to £1,271,922 for the same period last year. The most significant increases were in the purchase of machinery, electrical materials, rubber, and cotton textiles, especially in cotton textiles. Although the number of British purchases of woolens is not yet known, it is not much different from the number of Soviet Russian purchases of British goods. According to Russian officials, due to Congressman Johnson's proposal to ban loans to countries that do not fulfill their debt obligations, Soviet Russia has switched to ordering many goods from the United Kingdom instead of the United States.

<p>(Washington) The White House announced today that President Roosevelt has decided to reject plans to purchase large quantities of silver in order to raise world prices, and therefore the President will not approve most of the silver bills in this Congress. The White House also said that the President does not want this Congress to enact any further silver bills or new silver proposals. The Congressional Silver Conference is scheduled to meet tomorrow, but whether it has been invited by the President is now a difficult question. It is rumored that the General Assembly has already convened the conference, but it has been denied by the President. According to President Roosevelt, he only allows the silver senators to send a representative to attend. Therefore, it is worth pondering how the silver conference will proceed tomorrow.

According to White House sources, President Roosevelt felt that the issue of silver currency recovery had already been discussed in the program submitted to the London World Economic Conference in June last year. According to this program, all countries would determine the amount of silver as reserves based on their gold supply. President Roosevelt also believed that this matter could not be handled by one country without the cooperation of other countries.

The plan provides for the establishment of an industrial advisory committee in each Federal Reserve district to review loan requests. The term of each loan is five years. The initiators of this plan, Bankhead and Glass, have both been instructed by President Roosevelt to advance this plan in both houses. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Prussian Prime Minister and German Cabinet Aviation Minister General Goering received a Reuters interviewer today in his room, which was decorated with a swastika flag, and discussed German domestic and foreign affairs at length in a frank manner. Goering, dressed in a white flannel suit, smiled as he spoke, saying that he loved England very much, but he was often misunderstood by the English people. He regretted that the English newspapers had vilified him as a "bloodthirsty pig" and did not understand the reason for such slander. He pointed out that the British government, like the German government, had to approve the death penalty. People who kill will be killed, otherwise they will kill again. Since Germany reinstated the death penalty, the number of murder cases has greatly decreased. Goering then spoke about aircraft, saying that he did not have military aircraft, but he did not deny that he had requested them. The issue of German air defense would eventually be discussed. Some people still accuse Germany of secretly rearming, but do you think I can build an air force of 3,000 aircraft like France without being feared? Why bother harping on it? The whole world knows that France does not want to disarm, but if France wants war, then I can't do anything about it. However, all the people of Germany will rise up together to protect the German border when the country is invaded. Goering continued to talk about domestic affairs, saying that Germany's position was completely stable, but the government's procedures would take several years to implement effectively. Communism has been eradicated, but if this doctrine exists in other countries, it is still dangerous and cannot be eliminated. Other countries are very lenient in their treatment of communists in detention centers, so that the communists have become more active recently. In order to cope with this trend, I have decided to issue strict punitive measures. There are currently about six or seven thousand people in German detention centers, most of them communists. When asked whether communist leaders such as Thälmann could be released, Goering replied that there was no such question, because they were very disobedient and the charges against them were still in progress. Thälmann's life in prison is still good. He has abandoned communism and asked whether the government, which now has the support of 99% of the people, could be lenient with him. He (Goering) replied that this statement was very wrong. If 1% of the people in the country resist the government and are not stopped, then this 1% will start propaganda and bewitch the 99%. Propaganda is very harmful if it is not counteracted. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Paris Communist Party and Socialist Party Clash Violently with Police Again; Hold Mass Meeting to Oppose Government Salary Cuts; Over a Thousand Detained, Foreign Nationals to Be Deported <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Despite strict government bans on gatherings, the Communist and Socialist parties secretly planned to hold a mass meeting today on the Rue du Faubourg-Montmartre to oppose the order to cut civil servant salaries and to protest against the government and Fascism. However, the police, forewarned of their plan, took strict precautions. When demonstrators marched in a column to the square on that street, they were blocked by the police. A violent confrontation ensued. Thousands of police and patrolmen guarded each street entrance leading to the square. Seeing no way to reach their meeting place, the demonstrators initially lingered outside the restricted area, remaining relatively calm. But soon, their anger became uncontrollable, and they clashed with the police. The first clash occurred at 6:30 PM, presenting a comical scene. It was raining heavily, like a forest of umbrellas waving, and police and Communists slipped and fell on the road one after another, covered in mud. Shortly after, the scene resembled the riots of February. Large numbers of Communist Party members, Socialist Party members, and civil servants charged forward, attempting to reach the square, but were repeatedly repelled by the police. As the demonstrators attacked, they sang the Internationale loudly. Despite their best efforts, they failed to reach their destination. The police were very effective in suppressing the riot. Although several people were struck on the head during the fighting, no serious consequences occurred. Therefore, before midnight, half of the police present had withdrawn. Over a thousand demonstrators were arrested in the operation. Most will be released after questioning, but foreign nationals among them will be severely punished or deported. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, two thousand disabled veterans of the European War marched through the bustling streets to protest against the recent government austerity measures, especially the order to reduce disability benefits. The demonstrators dispersed in front of the Place de l'Opéra without incident. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Six thousand people, responding to the call of the Communist Party and orthodox Socialist Party, held a demonstration in front of the City Hall Square, defying the Interior Ministry's ban. These people, united with civil servants, protested against the government's austerity measures and the disciplinary actions against postal and telecommunications workers. At 6:30 PM, when shops and factories closed for the day, clashes began between demonstrators and police. By 6:45 PM, the crowd in front of the City Hall Square had been dispersed by the police. Order was restored by 7:00 PM, and some police units withdrew. A total of 960 people were arrested, including some foreigners, all of whom will be deported. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Paris is again in a tense state today. Thousands of rioters gathered in the bustling streets, including Communists, Socialists, and veterans of the Great War. They marched through the streets to City Hall to petition for the immediate resignation of the entire City Council and the abolition of the Paris City Hall. This disturbance was triggered by Premier Doumergue's austerity policy, which aims to reduce expenditures by 2.56 billion francs. Most of those affected by the salary cuts are civil servants and veterans. The police made every effort to suppress the rioters and prevent them from entering the City Hall. About a thousand people were arrested, of whom 940 will be detained for one day and then released. Others carrying weapons will be charged with rebelling against the government. After several hours of suppression, order was restored by midnight. Premier Doumergue's attitude is extremely firm, refusing to rescind the austerity measures. He argues that there is no other way to alleviate the country's current difficulties; otherwise, the government's finances will be in dire straits, and all domestic and foreign debts will be defaulted. However, these austerity measures are temporary in nature, and everything will return to normal once the crisis has passed. (National News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Harbin dispatch, On the 12th of this month, Li Xizhen, the Chinese director of the Sanitation Department of the East China Railway Bureau, was arrested at his residence in Nangang by the Japanese Kempeitai in Harbin and detained in the Kempeitai headquarters. At noon on the same day, several senior Soviet staff members of the Sanitary Squad were also arrested one after another by Jiang Kou, the head of the Criminal Section of the Puppet Harbin Police Department, and puppet detectives. The reason for the arrest of Li and others was that the Central Railway Hospital in Nangang, Harbin, which is under the jurisdiction of the East China Railway Sanitation Department, had a stock of valuable medicines worth more than 500,000 gold rubles, along with valuable medical equipment worth more than 300,000 rubles. Recently, all of them were lost completely. After many days of investigation by the Japanese Kempeitai and the puppet state police, it was learned that the Soviet side had secretly transported them back to their country. Moreover, the secret transportation did not start this year, but since the autumn of last year, they had been secretly packed and transported out of the country through Manchuria and Suifenhe. Although the area was surrounded by Japanese border police of the puppet state, the Russians still managed to transport the goods out. After the Japanese discovered this, they believed that the Chinese director Li Xizhen was involved in this matter and was suspected of colluding with Russian personnel in embezzling public property, so he was arrested. The Japanese considered the case to be of great importance, and many Chinese employees of the East China Railway were implicated. The Japanese Kempeitai is conducting a secret investigation. Shi Yiwuciji, the Soviet Consul-General in Harbin, visited Shi Luben, the special envoy for Beiman affairs of the puppet government, that afternoon and lodged a strong protest, saying that Soviet railway personnel should not be arrested arbitrarily, causing disruption to official business. The puppet special envoy sophistically replied strongly. In the evening, Bandu, the Soviet Deputy Director of the East China Railway, also sent a protest letter to Li Shaogeng, the Director of the East China Railway of the puppet government, saying that the Japanese were obstructing railway affairs and the puppet state should not be instigated by them to arrest railway personnel. Li did not reply. The Russian Director, Ludi, also sent an official letter to Li Shaogeng, saying that the management and staff of the East China Railway no longer have legal protection and everyone is feeling the danger to themselves, which has a significant impact on the railway's operations. If this results in losses to the railway's business, the puppet Manchukuo side will be responsible. Li Shaogeng dared not reply without authorization and has telegraphed the Ministry of Transport of the puppet capital for instructions. After Li Xizhen was arrested, the puppet Director Li Shaogeng appointed Li Jimin, a special commissioner of the department, as acting director in his place, but the Russian Director Ludi refused to sign the approval and directly appointed Si Zhichiqi, a physician of the department's epidemic prevention, to act as director. The puppet side tried hard to argue but to no avail. Currently, both sides are doing their own thing. The Japanese side ordered the puppet Director Li Shaogeng to negotiate with the Russian side and demand the return of the stolen medicines, otherwise, it would summon certain senior officials of the East China Railway and investigate who was behind it, intending to intimidate them and retrieve the medicines and equipment, but the Russian side did not move. Li Xizhen is the son of Li Youlan, the former Liaoning Eastern Border Circuit Commissioner. Li Youlan and Yuan Jinkai co-founded the Puppet Fengtian Security Maintenance Association, but later, fearing public criticism, he fled into the pass. His son, however, continued to serve the puppet state outside the pass, and it was unexpected that he would be arrested by the Japanese now.</p>
<p>In addition, on the 11th of this month, eighteen freight cars of the East China Railway Harbin Station suddenly disappeared. The puppet side, on Japanese orders, investigated in detail for a long time and finally discovered that they had been secretly transported back to their country by Soviet railway personnel. The cars were also fully loaded with raw materials for the manufacture of munitions and poison gas collected from various parts of Northeast China. After the investigation was completed, Shi Luben, the special envoy for North Manchuria affairs of the puppet government, lodged a protest with the Russian consulate in Harbin, but the Russian side adhered to pragmatism and remained silent regardless of the protest. This, like the incident of the theft of medicines, is a serious unresolved issue. (13th)</p>

<p>Lanzhou airmail dispatch, Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, Yang Hucheng, Director of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, and his wife, Xu Gongwu, Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan, Wang Yingyu, Deputy Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Buck, a water conservancy consultant, and Lu Yuzheng, a civil engineer, and six others flew to Lanzhou from Shaanxi at 1:20 PM on the 12th. Li, the Secretary-General of the Gansu Provincial Government who went to Jiangxi to receive training, the Director of the Water Department, and Tan, the Director of the Qinghai Civil Affairs Department, also arrived in Lanzhou. Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Deng Baoshan, and officials above the director level of various agencies, and more than 3,000 students from various schools were waiting at the airport to welcome them. After Dai and Yang got off the plane, they shook hands with each of the welcomers, then took a car into the city and stayed at the Provincial Government. On the 13th, Dai attended the Provincial Party Department and gave a speech to the Party affairs workers, encouraging them to work hard to promote the country's salvation through production. He then went to the front of the Provincial Government with Yang Hucheng to participate in the welcome rally of all circles. On that day, about 10,000 people from various agencies, schools, mass organizations, and troops attended the meeting, and the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic. Zhu Shaoliang gave a welcome speech, followed by a speech by Dai, which said that this trip to Gansu was specifically to investigate water conservancy in the Northwest, but due to time constraints, he could not stay here for a long time to conduct a detailed investigation. In the future, he would do his best to work for the Northwest. Gansu is superior to other provinces in terms of heaven, earth, and people, but it lacks a 'doing' determination, so various constructions have not achieved much success. In the future, as long as we work hard, the future will be very smooth, because the Premier has planned everything for us, and we just need to follow the blueprint. In the future, a society of universal harmony will not be difficult to realize in the Northwest. Yang Hucheng and Deng Baoshan also gave speeches, and the words were all sincere. At 1:00 PM, they visited the Provincial Relief Institute, the Orphanage, and the Women's Normal School, and at 2:00 PM, they visited the Agricultural School and the Gansu Academy, and gave speeches to various secondary schools in Lanzhou at the Academy. At 5:00 PM, they attended the banquet of Party, military, and government officials. On the 14th, they visited Puzhao Temple, Zhuangyan Temple, Wuquan Mountain, the Yellow River Iron Bridge, Lei Tan, and Xiaoxihu and other places. On the 15th, Dai took a plane to Qinghai again, accompanied by Xu Gongwu, Wang Yingyu, Buck, and Lu Yuzheng. The flight took off at 10:30 AM. Yang Hucheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Deng Baoshan, and others went to the airport to see them off. After Dai boarded the plane, the plane circled Lanzhou several times before flying west. Before Dai took off, he also had the following conversation with reporters, saying that (I, Dai, referred to myself) I am grateful for the welcome and send-off from all walks of life for this trip to Lanzhou. Although it was only a few days in Lanzhou, the impression of various situations was very good. This is really a blessing for the future of Gansu. After I arrive in Qinghai today, I will rest for one night and visit Ta'er Temple tomorrow (the 16th), because that is a famous temple in Qinghai. I will tour that place for a day. I will return to Qinghai Provincial City on the 17th, give speeches to fellow countrymen from all walks of life, and visit various places. Because I am eager to return to Beijing to handle various affairs, I will not be able to stay in Qinghai for a long time, so I plan to take a direct flight to Xi'an on the 18th. On the 19th, I plan to go to Wugong with Chairman Shao of Shaanxi and others to attend the groundbreaking ceremony of the agricultural school. At the same time, Wugong is not far from Baoji. There is Baoji Gorge on the south bank of the Wei River in Baoji, which is very convenient for water conservancy. The Central Government plans to help the Shaanxi Provincial Government open a canal in that place. The amount of land that can be irrigated by this canal will exceed the Jinghui Canal. However, Shaanxi Province has financial difficulties and may not be able to host this independently. Therefore, the Central Government plans to co-host it with the Shaanxi Provincial Government in order to complete it as soon as possible. After the visit to that place is completed, I will go to Meishan to visit the agricultural farm attached to the agricultural school in that county, and I can return to Beijing on the 22nd or as late as the 23rd.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Wang Yingyu Talks About the Yellow River Management Plan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yingyu, Deputy Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, came to Gansu this time with Chairman Dai to investigate water conservancy and has now completed his work. He flew to Qinghai by special plane on the 15th. Before leaving, he met with reporters and said, "Chairman Dai paid close attention to water conservancy in the Northwest during this trip. Therefore, when departing from Beijing, he made a special appointment to travel with me to consult on water conservancy matters. After arriving in Gansu, according to investigations from all parties, I deeply feel that the construction of water conservancy in Gansu is also really urgent. After Chairman Song comes to Gansu for inspection, there will definitely be a whole plan. This Association will also do its best to help host it. However, the mission of this Association is water conservancy in the provinces along the Yellow River. If the Yellow River is not well managed, not only will water conservancy be out of the question, but the Yellow River floods in recent years will also be impossible to eliminate. Therefore, managing the Yellow River is the fundamental solution to water conservancy in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. I (Wang refers to himself) feel that the Yellow River breaches every year, which is really a great disaster for all provinces. In the future, the management of the Yellow River will be carried out in three sections, that is, divided into three reaches, from Shaanxi to the west as the upper reaches, from Shaanxi to the east to the junction of Shandong and Henan as the middle reaches, and from western Shandong to the estuary as the lower reaches. Regarding the management methods for the upper reaches, it is planned to plant trees on both banks to consolidate the dikes and avoid breaches. At the same time, divert river water to the sandy fields on both banks of the Yellow River in order to use the force of the water to accumulate good soil and gradually turn the sandy fields into good land, which can not only help consolidate the dikes but also be used for cultivation and open up sources of profit. Regarding the middle reaches, the Liuyuankou and Heigangkou areas have often breached in recent years, and the provincial capital of Kaifeng is in great danger. The reason for this is that the Mangshan Mountain west of Luoyang is close to the river. The mountain is made of blunt soil, and the river water erodes it, causing a large amount of sand and soil to flow into the plains of the Heigangkou area, raising the riverbed in that area, so it is easy to breach. In the future, it is planned to build dikes on the west side of Mangshan Mountain to save this disaster. Regarding the lower reaches, every year in summer and autumn when the river water rises sharply, the Ljin area of Shandong often suffers from floods. The reason why that area often suffers from floods is that the river course in that area is uncertain, sometimes flowing east and sometimes flowing south. In the future, the management plans to deepen that area, build dikes on both banks, and divert the river course to the Litinjkou, where the river water can be easily discharged. If the river water is not easily discharged, breaches will naturally not occur again. If the Yellow River can be managed in this way, the water conservancy problems of several provinces will be easily solved." (April 18th)</p>

<p>Jinan dispatch, After Liu Guitang's bandit troops were severely attacked by the bandit suppression army near Qishan, Anqiu, due to excessive casualties, they were no longer able to form a single force and fled in a panic towards Zhucheng and Jizhou. On the night of the 18th, they stopped and rested in the Shichang area, 60 li northeast of Juxian County. Upon receiving the report, Han Fuju, believing that the area was surrounded by mountains and the terrain was dangerous, mobilized a large army that night to encircle and suppress them in order to completely wipe them out. Unexpectedly, after midnight, heavy rain poured down, and Liu's bandits took advantage of the rain to break through the encirclement and flee south. At 9:00 AM this morning, they had reached the Yangjiaguan Village, 45 li southeast of Juxian County. The 81st Division of Zhan Shutang's troops rushed from the south of Juxian County to intercept them, killing more than 30 bandits, capturing more than 40, and seizing 18 horses, more than 20 rifles and carbines, and more than 70 rounds of ammunition. The bandits were defeated and fled in panic to the south, passing through Doushan River, Tengjia River, Wangjia Pit, Pan Dianzi, crossing Jiazi Mountain, passing through Zhu Juntang, Tushan, Qingfengyu, Xiaohushan, and Majiazhuang, and turning east. They fled east along the Xiuqian River through Luojiayu, Qian Yequ Shangzhuang, and Xiazhuang, and entered the border of Rizhao. They passed through Xiao'er Mountain, Deli Village, Shangshan Village, Dahuang, and Xiaopo Village, and arrived near Maxin Mountain at noon. The various bandit suppression troops continued to track and pursue them. At 4:00 PM, the bandits fled north again through Qianhou He Village to the vicinity of Shengguan Mountain. After being intercepted by Zhan Shutang's troops, they turned south again and crossed the mountains south of Dahekou Village to the Zhucao Village area. This area is the border between Shandong and Jiangsu and is the southwestern border of Rizhao County, only four or five li from the border of Ganyu County, Jiangsu. Because the army was pursuing them very closely, Liu's bandits fled again into Ganyu County, Jiangsu.</p>
<p>After Liu's bandits re-entered Jiangsu from Shandong, Han Fuju telegraphed Wang Jun, commander of the 7th Division, to send troops to intercept them. The bandit suppression army in Shandong Province continued to pursue and suppress them without regard to borders. According to Han Fuju's statement today (19th), Liu's bandits fled to the border between Jiangsu and Shandong, and he has sent Zhan Shutang's division, Tang Bangzhi's brigade, and Li Xuande's cavalry regiment to track and pursue them. He has also ordered Gu Liangmin's division of the 22nd Division to pursue them south from Linyi. According to the announcement of the Shandong Headquarters, (1) On the 17th, a company commander of Liu's bandits, Xue Ruitian, 30 bandits, five rifles and carbines, 25 rounds of ammunition, and three mules and donkeys were captured by the militia in Changle; (2) Cheng Shibiao, a lieutenant adjutant of Tang Bangzhi's brigade, killed 24 bandits and obtained 15 guns when pursuing and suppressing Liu's bandits near Qishan on the 17th, and was extremely brave; (3) On the 18th, the Yishui militia captured a bandit named Yang Zhilian, who admitted to serving as a quartermaster in Liu Guitang's troops and said that all the money looted in recent days had been abandoned because they were severely attacked by the army in Qishan on the 17th.

<p>Hankou dispatch, Xiao Ke and Gao Yongsheng, two groups of remnant bandits, who had been severely suppressed by the National Army, fled to the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and recently fled into the territory of Tongcheng, Hubei, entrenched in a certain mountain, and contacted the bandit troops trapped in Badou Mountain, Chongyang, with the intention of invading Tongcheng. A regiment of Feng Xingxian's 33rd Division is stationed there and is preparing to fight back. Xiao Zhichu of the 44th Division and Guo Runian of the 26th Division will each send elite troops, together with the security team, to assist in the suppression. The Xiang-E Road along the line is currently still peaceful. Li Jue's division of He Jian's troops has sent a unit to join the road protection, and there are armored car teams patrolling back and forth. Currently, foreign reports carry news of bandit Zhao Liqiao, but after investigation, there is no such thing. It is heard that a small group of bandits, numbering several hundred, fled to Fuchikou, across the river from Wuxue. They have now been completely wiped out. The naval authorities, because Wuxue is an important town in the lower reaches, have sent the Weisheng warship to protect it. Commander Feng Xingxian, believing that there are still many scattered bandits in Chongyang and Tongcheng, sent troops to search and suppress them in several routes. On the 20th, Feng sent two telegrams to Hankou to report victory, roughly as follows: (1) Although Gao Yongsheng's troops of the puppet 16th Division have been severely suppressed by the large army several times, their remnants are still fleeing in the border area of Hunan and Hubei, in the area of Pingjiang and Tongcheng. He ordered the two regimental commanders, Qin and Zhang, to each lead their strong units to pursue and suppress the bandits in different routes. The main force of the bandits avoided the real and attacked the empty, fleeing upon hearing the wind. The previous morning, Zhang's regiment camped in Maishi. Gao's bandits personally led their 46th and 48th regiments, with about 1,000 guns and nine machine guns, surrounded Maishi from all sides during heavy rain and thick fog. Regimental Commander Zhang Shouling directed his troops to respond calmly. The bandits charged fiercely several times but were repelled. After four hours of fierce fighting, the bandits, suffering too many casualties, fled to Huangpao Mountain. He is currently tracking and pursuing them. In this battle, the bandits suffered more than 130 casualties, 10 rifles and 1 pistol were captured, 8 bandits were captured alive, and many other items were seized. You Jijie, chief of staff of the puppet 16th Division, was killed on the spot. (2) After the remnant bandits in southern Hubei were searched and suppressed by our army, they are gradually being eliminated. The bandit local militia were quite panicked. Yesterday, 161 bandit local militiamen surrendered to Qin's regiment stationed in Xiaosaping from the Dadonggang area, and brought many Russian-made rifles and bullets. Among them were Yu Yunkai, who served as chairman and captain of the puppet Soviet government. After detailed interrogation, it was confirmed to be true and they were treated favorably in accordance with the surrender policy, which shows that the bandit side is gradually disintegrating and that the difficulty of suppressing the bandits is coming to an end.

<h3 id="e108">The Loan Amount Totals Five Million Yuan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch, The Guangdong Finance Department has borrowed funds from the business community to maintain the paper money of the Provincial Bank. The loan matter has now been realized. In recent days, the price of paper money has risen from 90% to 95%. If the government continues to increase the reserve funds of the Provincial Bank, reduce the amount of paper money in circulation, and collect all county taxes in paper money, it will not be difficult for the price of paper money to return to its full value in the near future. The procedure for the Finance Department to borrow funds is to raise funds from two aspects. A loan of 1.5 million yuan was borrowed from the cigarette industry and was signed on the 10th of this month. 350,000 yuan was paid on the same day, and the remaining 1.15 million yuan will be paid in installments. This loan is allocated and borrowed by the cigarette industry according to the amount of unified tax paid by each tobacco company in the most recent three months. The Nanyang Tobacco Company borrowed 420,000 yuan, the British American Tobacco Company borrowed 310,000 yuan, the Dahua Company borrowed 200,000 yuan, the Guoxiang Tobacco Company borrowed 160,000 yuan, the Minzhong Tobacco Company borrowed 120,000 yuan, and other cigarette companies borrowed 290,000 yuan to make up 1.5 million yuan. The cigarette industry signed a contract with the Finance Department, stipulating a weekly interest rate of one percent and a loan term of eight months, with tobacco unified tax as collateral. If it is not repaid by the deadline, the cigarette merchants are allowed to deduct it from the tobacco unified tax payments. In addition, 3.5 million yuan is undertaken by a merchant named Huo, who guarantees it with a certain donation fund. Since the 12th, Huo has paid 1 million yuan in cash and 1.5 million yuan in provincial paper money, totaling 2.5 million yuan, to the Finance Department, which was then allocated by the Finance Department to the Provincial Bank as reserve funds. The remaining 1 million yuan is expected to be paid in full by around the 15th of this month. The Provincial Bank has been able to freely exchange cash for several days due to this large sum of cash, and the price of paper money should be able to restore its full value in a few more days. The government's plan to increase the agricultural product tax surcharge as a reserve fund for the Provincial Bank is also actively underway, and it is also preparing to issue special tax certificates for imported agricultural products for a short period of time. Merchants can first receive them in provincial currency and then use the certificates to offset tax payments in the future. The special tax bureaus for agricultural products in various places will handle this. (April 14th)</p>

<p>Regarding the case of four bandits robbing a fisherman's family in Yuan Ye in East Street, Pavilion Forest Town on the evening of the 18th, and kidnapping relatives Wang and Yao, two girls, as previously reported, it is now known that the Wang girl is from Hougang, and the Yao girl is from the Zhangyan elite family. After the incident, the fisherman's wife Gu sneaked out to call the police to pursue the bandits. At that time, four police officers were only a few dozen steps away from the fleeing bandits. They saw the two hostages, one being carried and one being led, staggering away. However, the police neither fired a warning shot nor rushed forward to rescue them, but instead ran back to the station to gather their colleagues to chase them. The bandits had already gone far. Therefore, the Gu family reported that the four bandits only carried one broadsword, and the four police officers were fearful and unwilling to advance, failing in their duties. Yesterday, they specifically reported to Song for severe punishment. Director Zhou ordered Branch Director Yang Meilin to send the three negligent police officers to Song today for interrogation and, at the same time, send separate notices to the water and land police guard agencies to find ways to rescue the hostages.</p>

<p>The Taihe Tea House in front of the Huguo Temple outside the West Gate was opened by Pan Fushou, who borrowed the house from Changfeng Xinghang, and has been in business for many years. Because Pan's business was slow, he recently hired Wang Dongsheng from Taixing, his 16-year-old son, and his 12-year-old son to perform Tan Huang. The performances were very popular. Because the house had been in disrepair for many years, at 2:00 PM on the 20th, not long after the performance began, a central beam in the building suddenly came loose from the mortise joint where it was inserted into the pillar. The floor collapsed with a crash, and dozens of audience members fell down, suffering many injuries. An eight-year-old female student, Wang Weirou, who was a student in the first grade of Lianxi Elementary School and the young daughter of Wang Qiren, the owner of Wang Yongmao Tofu Shop, asked for leave from school due to a minor illness and went to the teahouse to get some boiled water. She had just taken the pot to her mouth when the building collapsed and crushed her underneath. Her head and left temple were crushed beyond recognition. She was sent to Cunren Hospital in the city, where President Xu Pingshu diagnosed that her brain matter was flowing out and she was bleeding from all orifices. He deemed that she could not be saved. She died at home around 5:00 PM. Local men Xu Axiao and Wang Wenfu were both injured in the legs, Li Qingyun was injured in the waist, Huang Zhiqing was injured in the foot, and Shi Ama, a boy from Kunshan who came to Jiading to sell firewood, was injured in the leg.

<p>Li Baoyou, the owner of a barbershop in Lishe Town, the 15th district under the jurisdiction of the county, and his wife, Dai, beat their apprentice, Chen Youfu, to death on November 12th of last year. Recently, the deceased's father, Chen Jiafu, came to Wuxi and, with the approval of the County Court, transported the coffin to the city the day before yesterday and opened it for inspection in an empty grave outside the West Gate. Because the body was decomposed, it was changed to steaming the bones for examination yesterday (the 21st). At 8:30 AM yesterday, the acting prosecutor ordered two forensic officials, Wang and Liu, to take out the bones sealed in the box and place them on the table. First, Chen Jiafu was asked to taste the water in the pot to ask if anything else had been added. Chen replied that it was pure water. Then, the forensic officials placed the bones in the steamer to steam. Steaming was completed at 11:00 AM. The bones were taken out of the steamer. Forensic official Wang used clean water to wash the skull, forensic official Liu washed the finger and toe bones, and the earthworker washed the thigh bones. By 12:00 PM, all 365 bones of the whole body had been completely cleaned and placed on the table, arranged in a human form. The acting prosecutor ordered the deceased's father, Chen Jiafu, and the defendants Li Baoyou and Dai to stand beside the table. He then ordered forensic official Wang to first examine the skull in detail and scrape it with a bowl's edge. He found it to be white with no injuries. He then ordered the deceased's father, Chen Jiafu, to point out where the fatal wound of the deceased was, but Chen was stunned and speechless. Shi then ordered forensic official Wang to scrape and examine the twelfth rib from the left rib to the right rib, but there were also no injuries. Other arm bones and ribs were also examined, and there were no injuries. The examination was completed after about half an hour. The findings were reported to the acting prosecutor for review. The acting official confirmed that there was no error and that the death was due to illness before death. At this point, the deceased's father, Chen Jiafu, was summoned for questioning. The acting official said, "Now that the examination is complete and no injuries have been found, you have also seen it on the spot. Do you have anything to say now?" According to Chen's statement, "The cause of my son's death is said to be different by the villagers. Many say that he was beaten to death by the defendant, but I did not see it. Moreover, according to what was published in the Xibao, it was also said that he was beaten to death, so I filed a petition to seek justice." After reviewing the statement, the acting official ordered him to be taken into custody. Then, the head of the 83rd map, Qiang Ronghua, the head of the 226th map, Cai Zixian, and the head of the 227th map, Chen Zizhao, were summoned for questioning. They were also ordered to sign a statement that they witnessed the examination of the bones. Finally, the official ordered the bones to be sealed in a box and taken to the court for storage. The empty coffin was buried there. At 1:00 PM, the defendants and the bones were taken to the court for review.</p>

<p>London Silver Bar The London silver market closed weak today. The spot price was quoted at 19 pence and 6875, a decrease of 1875. The futures price was 19 pence and 75, a decrease of 25. In the morning, the United States and China sold, and India bought.</p>
<p>New York Silver Bar The New York silver market opened weak due to the weakness in London. The sentiment was very uneven. Generally, people are paying attention to today's meeting between President Roosevelt and the silver faction legislators, and it is expected that the bulls will have some settlements, fearing that President Roosevelt will oppose the silver faction's plan. The forward opening price was reduced by 25 to 10 points compared to yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Bombay Silver Bar The Bombay silver market closed calmly today. The spot price was 54 rupees and 7 annas, a decrease of 7 annas. The futures prices also decreased by 7 annas.</p>

<p>British-American The London foreign exchange market was still stable this morning. The British-American exchange rate opened at 5 yuan, 1 jiao, and 7 and a half fen, a decrease of 25 compared to yesterday's American-British exchange rate. It fluctuated slightly afterward. The closing price was 5 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, and 875, a decrease of 625 compared to the opening price. Also, 1 US dollar is equivalent to 3 shillings, 10 pence, and 4328 British gold.</p>
<p>British-French Today in London, someone bought francs, causing the price to rise. The British-French exchange rate opened at 77 francs and 53, which was 18 pounds lower than yesterday. It continued to decline afterward, closing at 77 francs and 34, which was 19 pounds lower than the opening price.</p>
<p>American-British Today, the New York exchange rate for British currency opened at 5.17.0, a decrease of 75 compared to the previous day's closing price. There was no increase or decrease in the 23rd market. The fourth market rebounded by 25, to 5.17.25. The fifth market declined slightly, changing to 5.17.125. The sixth market increased again, remaining at 5.17.25.</p>
<p>American-French Today, the New York exchange rate for French currency opened at 6.6825, an increase of 15 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Trend of Further Reduction in the Gold Content of the US Dollar A London dispatch on the 21st states that the recent weakness of the US dollar has attracted much attention. However, it should be noted that this weakness is not commensurate with the amount of transactions, because the transactions are not large. The downward trend of American goods has led people to expect that President Roosevelt may further reduce the gold content of the US dollar in order to raise prices. The French franc is now very close to the New York gold export price, but if the gold price of the US dollar is not reduced, the current exchange rate may not be sustainable, because the authorities may not be willing to allow gold to be shipped to Paris. Although President Roosevelt announced his opposition to the silver inflation bill, the silver faction in Congress has expressed serious opposition to his remarks.</p>
<p>Hongsheng Foreign Company also received a telegram from London stating that, according to the New York dispatch of the London Financial News, there are many rumors in New York that President Roosevelt will now reduce the gold content of the dollar, causing the prices of the pound and franc in the London market to be very firm. The franc is now gradually approaching the point of gold export. Operators in the foreign exchange market say that foreigners are withdrawing a lot of deposits, and American investors and speculators are vying to buy foreign securities.</p>
<p>Temporary Difficulty in Achieving British Stable Exchange Rate A London dispatch on the 21st states that the remarks made by Mr. Sader, Vice President of the Central Bank of the United States, at the annual meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce yesterday have drawn attention to the fluctuations in the exchange market. At that time, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce proposed a motion criticizing the premature stability measures, but it was immediately withdrawn because Sader did not approve of the motion. Sader said that the main crisis in Britain is the indefinite delay in stability, which forced the gold countries to abandon the gold standard. The excessively high exchange rate of the pound against the reference currency franc is a serious matter, because the nature of their exports is competitive with each other. However, the trade between Britain and the United States has more complementary elements than competitive ones.</p>

<p>The New York securities market opened today with a hesitant and watchful appearance, as it was heard that President Roosevelt was unwilling to proceed with the silver legislation bill during the current Congressional session. The opening was stable, with limited fluctuations and uncertain trends. Maintaining the market situation was the news of commercial recovery. The number of transactions in the first hour after the opening was 460,000 shares. The Hongsheng Foreign Company's report on the market prices of 15 types of New York securities (as of 10:45 AM) is listed below:</p>

<p>American Cotton The cotton market opened weakly, and sentiment was apprehensive due to the unfavorable situation of the silver legislation bill.

The settlement income of the industry, and the purchases of Japanese and European merchants, corresponded to the retail sales of the South and the local area, and the closing of brokers.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to the closing of long positions, and then rose due to the purchases of exporters. The closing price of July-August white Roch cotton was 197 rupees and 25, an increase of one and a half rupees.</p>

<p>The New York rubber market opened strong and active, because the London market was firm and there were optimistic restriction rumors. However, its activity was limited by profit-taking.</p>
<p>London The rubber market was firm and stable today. The prices for July and September were 6 pence, an increase of 0.0625 compared to yesterday.</p>

It is Said That No Decision Has Been Made on Opening Traffic and Postal Services.

<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to seek medical treatment for his old illness and to visit Foreign Vice Minister Tang Youren. He returned to Nanjing by night train that evening. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Wang originally planned to come to Shanghai last week to seek medical treatment for his old illness, but he postponed it because he failed to meet with Chairman Chiang and others in Nanchang. It was not until 7:00 AM yesterday that he came to Shanghai from Nanjing on a special train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. After getting off at the Nanxiang Station, he took his own car and went straight to his private residence on West Pubashi Road to rest. In addition to his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming of the Ministry of Railways, those who came to Shanghai with Wang yesterday morning also included Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister Zou Lin of the Ministry of Finance, and Vice Minister Gan Naiguang of the Ministry of Interior, all of whom got off at the North Station.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Seeking Medical Treatment <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>After returning to his residence, Wang immediately invited German doctor Nore to his private residence at 8:20 AM to examine his old illness of diabetes. The examination lasted about half an hour. Doctor Nore took Wang's blood back to the hospital for testing. At around 10:00 AM, Wang took a car to Nore Hospital on Avenue Joffre to inspect the results of the blood test. Nore also prepared Western medicine for Wang's treatment. He did not leave the hospital until around 11:00 AM and returned to his residence for lunch.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Visiting Tang and Song Separately <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Wang, accompanied by Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming of the Ministry of Railways, went to the private residence of Foreign Vice Minister Tang Youren on Gamston Road at 9:15 AM yesterday to visit Tang's illness and discuss recent diplomacy. He did not leave until after about an hour. Then, at 3:00 PM, he went to Qiqi Road to visit Song Ziwen, a Standing Committee member of the National Economic Commission. He left at 3:45 PM. It is said that the content of the talks between Wang and Song yesterday was mostly about the progress of all construction projects of the Economic Commission.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Wang's Remarks <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Wang told visiting reporters yesterday that the central government has not yet made any decision on the issue of opening traffic and postal services, because the fundamental solution is still under careful consideration. If there are other appropriate solutions or a decision is made to negotiate in the future, it should first be made public to solicit the opinions of the people of the country before making a final decision. There will be no secret negotiations. As for the rumor that Chairman Huang has a solution to this problem, I have not heard of it. In short, it is said that there should be a way to open it if it can be opened, and there should be a way to deal with it if it cannot be opened. But everything needs to be studied. Regarding the unofficial statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also issued an unofficial statement in response. There is no need for another statement. Although other countries have not made any official statements on this move by Japan, public opinion is extremely indignant.</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, this year's Chicago Exposition has been decided to open early on the 26th of next month. The association for China's participation in the Chicago Exposition had only shipped one-third of the exhibits to Shanghai as of yesterday. Therefore, the shipment by the Hoover Mail Steamer on the 24th is likely to be postponed again. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited the person in charge of the association yesterday, and the details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Increase in Exhibits <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Last year, China participated with over 420 crates of exhibits, but many were related to culture and art, with very few of an international trade nature. Although not all exhibits have arrived in Shanghai this year, there will be a strong increase of one-half compared to last year, totaling about 1,000 crates. Items such as porcelain, tea, and carpets are unique products of our country. It is hoped that their display in the United States will reverse the disastrous decline of our overseas market.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Shipping Date <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Originally scheduled to be shipped from Shanghai on the 17th of this month, it was postponed to the 24th due to the exhibits not arriving in time. However, as of today, only one-third of the exhibits have been shipped to Shanghai, and they will definitely not be fully assembled by then. Therefore, the association sent a letter and telegram yesterday to Dong Fanfan and other locations, urging them to arrive by the end of this month. The final shipping date is set for May 1st on the President Grant steamer to Chicago. Chinese representatives accompanying the exhibits will include Dong Kunfan, Zhou Guanhong, and Zhang Wendi.</p>

<p>The association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry: This association shipped a total of 420 crates of exhibits to Chicago last year. With your ministry's approval, the Ministry of Finance was consulted, and the Jianghai Customs Commissioner was instructed to collect taxes on the actual number of items sold and requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to provide a guarantee. Now that the Chicago Exposition has decided to continue the exhibition this year, all the exhibits shipped by this association in the past will remain on display. We hereby request your ministry to review and approve, and kindly inform the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Customs Administration to instruct the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to allow the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to guarantee the exhibits shipped to Chicago last year and to collect taxes on the actual number of items sold at the close of this year's conference to facilitate settlement."</p>

<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Eurasia Aviation Corporation recently decided to purchase the German Junkers Ju 52 all-metal aircraft. The purchase of this latest aircraft is closely related to Eurasia Aviation Corporation's recently expanded route plans. In addition to maintaining the existing flight plans from Shanghai via Nanjing, Luoyang, and Xi'an to Lanzhou, with flights in each direction once a week, the company will also open new routes from Luoyang via Hankou and Changsha to Guangzhou and from Luoyang via Taiyuan to Beiping starting May 1st. These routes will connect in Luoyang, forming a direct air route from Beiping to Guangzhou. To enhance passenger comfort and shorten travel time on this route, the company purchased new aircraft. The aircraft can carry 30 passengers, and it only takes eight hours to travel from Beiping to Guangzhou. It is reported that this is the first time China has used this type of aircraft. The company also announced yesterday that the aircraft will arrive in Shanghai soon, and the Beiping-Guangzhou route and the Sino-German route to Xinjiang will use this aircraft for flights in the future. Engineer He En was dispatched yesterday to inspect the Beiping-Guangzhou route, so that flights can begin on May 1st. The Shanghai-Xinjiang route is expected to be realized in June this year. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Dispatching Personnel to Inspect the Beiping-Guangzhou Air Route <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The newly opened Beiping-Guangzhou air route, recently established by the company, has been decided to commence operations on May 1st. The company has dispatched engineer He En yesterday to inspect the route. In the initial phase of operations starting on May 1st, the old aircraft will still be used. Once the new aircraft arrives in Shanghai, it will be replaced. The new aircraft is the Ju 52 type, measuring 19 meters in length, 6 meters in height, and 30 meters in width. The aircraft is equipped with complete radio communication equipment and direction-finding instruments, so it can determine the location of each station and the aircraft itself during flight, even without the assistance of ground radio stations, thereby enhancing flight safety. The aircraft's radio station is connected to the pilot's seat, allowing the pilot to calmly calculate the aircraft's location even during foggy conditions. The seats in the cabin are leather and extremely comfortable, and the view is very clear, allowing passengers to enjoy the scenery on both sides. The aircraft also has an electric kitchen, allowing passengers to eat comfortably. A distance of 2,000 kilometers can be reached in less than eight hours of flight if there are no intermediate landings.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Sino-German Flights Will Also Use New Aircraft <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation plans to use the Ju 52 aircraft for the Shanghai-Lanzhou air route after the Beiping-Guangzhou route achieves good business results. This route is the first segment of the route from Shanghai via Dihua to the Sino-Russian border. Once the Ju 52 aircraft is used, direct air travel from Dihua to Europe will be even more convenient. The route from Lanzhou to Dihua is currently suspended due to unrest in Xinjiang. It is hoped that it can be resumed this summer. Eurasia Aviation Corporation is taking this opportunity to upgrade all flight equipment to provide the latest air travel conveniences to long-distance passengers when the Xinjiang route is resumed.</p>

<p>The company announced yesterday that the new aircraft it purchased is excellent. The Junkers Ju 52 aircraft won the highest honor in the Alpine Aviation Competition held in Switzerland a few years ago. At that time, all the participants in the competition were transport aircraft. The main requirements were not only to have excellent flight capabilities but also to fly over the most difficult terrain in Europe, crossing mountain ranges of 4,000 meters. During the competition, the weather was extremely bad, and the aircraft had to fly in fog for several hours. The Junkers Ju 52 aircraft demonstrated its various advantages in this environment and won the greatest victory.

<p>The company also announced the advantages of the new giant aircraft's wings, stating that the Junkers auxiliary wing is installed at the rear of the wing and is equal in length to the wing. In calm winds, even when fully loaded with 3,500 kilograms, it only needs to travel 270 meters on the ground to take off. After taking off, the speed in the air can be increased to 260 kilometers per hour or even 300 kilometers per hour with the aid of this auxiliary wing. During landing, the aircraft's speed can also be reduced to only 65 kilometers per hour. Therefore, even when fully loaded with 3,500 kilograms, the Ju 52 aircraft only needs to continue for 180 meters on the ground after the wheels touch down to come to a complete stop. This aircraft is most suitable for use in China, where there are no extensive standby airport facilities along the route.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau recently discovered that large quantities of foreign cigarette paper are being smuggled into the country to evade taxes and sold to cigarette manufacturers at reduced prices, which is detrimental to national tax revenue. Yesterday, the bureau specifically instructed auditors to strictly enforce the law in different zones. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e159">Strict Enforcement Ordered <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Bureau ordered all auditors yesterday, stating: "It has recently been reported that smuggled cigarette paper is rampant and is being privately sold by various paper companies in this city. Strict enforcement is required. All direct importing paper companies must be closely monitored for reported imports and sales volumes of cigarette paper. Boxes must be opened and inspected to prevent fraud. The locations of the paper merchants are hereby divided into five zones, and auditors Bao Junzheng and others are responsible for supervising paper merchant matters. Any reported imports and sales of cigarette paper must be closely monitored and carefully inspected for quantity and width. All enforcement measures must be discussed with translator Huang and implemented properly. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance."</p>

<h3 id="e161">Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Industries Association Submits Document to the Executive Yuan Regarding Trademark Sound and Meaning <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Industries Association submitted a document to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the impact of the interpretation of trademark law on sound and meaning, stating: "Regarding the interpretation of trademark law, which presents an exception that harms national credibility, requesting (the Legislative Yuan) to propose supplements: According to the text of Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law, text, graphics, and symbols are inherently three different types. If the text does not contain sound and meaning, it is no different from graphics and symbols. Why must text be a prerequisite? This shows that text must contain sound and meaning. The difference between literate and illiterate people lies in whether they can read the sound of the word. If a deaf-mute person wants to be tested on whether they know a word or not, they must write another word with the same sound to show them. This is naturally the case. When illiterate people buy and sell goods, it depends entirely on what they hear and say. If trademark registration is permitted for trademarks with the same sound but different characters, wouldn't that encourage confusion? This has not been permitted by the Trademark Bureau's practice. However, since the Executive Yuan requested the Judicial Yuan's interpretation, it has been said that text does not contain meaning and is treated like graphics and symbols in general. This will allow cunning individuals to compete to use trademarks with the same sound but different characters to deceive the public, affecting the future of industry and commerce and overturning trademark precedents. The dignity of trademark registration will fundamentally disappear. Whether internally or externally, it is sufficient to harm national credibility. The only way to address this is to request your Yuan (your department to request the Legislative Yuan) to supplement Articles 1 and 2 of the Trademark Law based on the spirit of legislation, so as to reassure people and prevent cunning practices. As far as Article 1, Paragraph 2 is concerned, the original meaning is very broad and does not need to explicitly state that text includes sound and meaning. Because no one else has registered it before, there is no such thing as being the same or similar. Therefore, the crackdown is listed in the clauses of Article 2. The original intent of the legislation is very appropriate. However, for 'specified color to be applied,' it is proposed to add the word 'able' after the word 'parallel.' As for the original regulations, only one color is clearly applied, or there is no color at all, such as on glass bottles and iron lids. If imitators take different colors, they can argue. If the original registrant needs to prevent its disadvantages, they must first register all similar trademarks of various colors, which would result in a large income for the Trademark Bureau, but the industrialists and merchants could not bear the burden and it is also impossible to prevent. Therefore, if the word 'able' is added, those that are not necessarily similar are already included in the list of routine crackdowns. This is a request for Article 1, Paragraph 2. After listing the clauses in Article 2, it is proposed to add a clause: 'The aforementioned similarity or approximation includes the shape, color, sound, and meaning of text, graphics, and symbols. Anyone with a hint of imitation is included.' Because the trademark law has no clear provisions on the definition of approximation or similarity, this is a major shortcoming. As a result, the same case has different results, contradicting each other, making people unable to adapt. If it is clearly stipulated, it will be sufficient to prevent cunning and avoid various disputes. Therefore, we submit this document to request your Yuan (your department to request the Legislative Yuan) to adopt it, and contribute a foolish opinion. I can't help but look forward to it. Respectfully submitted to the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, Ministry of Industry."</p>

<p>The Industries Association Forwards to the National Tariff Commission for Consideration</p>
<p>Foreign-made match raw materials are lightly taxed and dumped on the market, severely impacting domestic goods. The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Industries Association previously requested the National Tariff Commission to increase import taxes on foreign goods and reduce export taxes on domestic goods to demonstrate promotion. Yesterday, the association re-submitted a comparison of new and old taxes to the commission. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Letter to the Industries Association <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Huachang and other wood slice factories sent a letter to the Industries Association, stating: "We have found that poplar and American poplar are used as raw materials for match stems, boxes, and slices. They are soft and not suitable for building materials, but they are suitable for manufacturing stems and slices. This is well known in the wood industry. If they are left for half a year, the wood will rot and turn black, becoming waste. This should be exempted from tariffs to maintain the industry. In Japan, manufacturers of stems and slices do not pay taxes on imported poplar raw materials, and exports of semi-finished products are tax-free. When they are transported to our country, they only pay import tax once and can be sold nationwide. This is not the case for domestic products. They are taxed on imported raw materials and semi-finished products, and the taxes are unusually high, making it impossible to compete with foreign goods. Before the tax was added last year, imported raw materials cost 6.78 yuan per thousand square feet, including surcharges. After the new tax was imposed, the same thousand feet of wood now cost 12 yuan in import tax. White poplar is a domestic product and originally had no tax rate. Since the loss of the northeastern provinces four years ago, the Shanghai Customs has gradually increased taxes on goods from the Northeast, almost to the same level as foreign goods. In addition, the export tax on domestic semi-finished products was valued at 3.5 taels of customs silver per dan before the tax was added. After the new tariff was set, it suddenly increased by half, with each dan assessed at 7 taels of customs silver. With a 7.5% tax, each package of 189 catties of stems and branches must be taxed at 1.5 yuan. Foreign semi-finished products are also estimated by weight. In Japan, to reduce evasion, each package weighs only 160 to 170 catties, so the tax is only around 1.4 yuan. The same package of stems and branches is taxed at 0.15 yuan more. Adding the import tax on raw materials, each package must bear 2 yuan more, which is 2.15 yuan more than imported semi-finished products. Therefore, foreign goods rely on tax-free imports and exports to our country, paying tax only once and dumping at low prices everywhere. Domestic products are under pressure and are declining. Inventory is piling up, and the trend of stagnation is imminent. The previous letter detailed the process and was presented to the Ministry of Finance and the National Tariff Commission for their consideration. The comparison of the old and new tax rates and the two copies of poplar raw materials are enclosed. We urge your association to provide relief and appeal again to the National Tariff Commission for prompt approval to increase taxes on semi-finished products, exempt poplar raw materials from import tax, and reduce export tax on domestic stems, boxes, and slices, so that the national treasury will not be damaged, and the thousands of workers in this industry and the tens of thousands of people who indirectly rely on it for a living will be spared from unemployment. This is a gift from your association. The national economy and people's livelihood are of great importance. With the utmost urgency, we submit our respects."</p>
<h3 id="e164">Submission to the National Tariff Commission <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Industries Association submitted a document to the National Tariff Commission, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the submission of supplementary reasons to approve the reduction of tax rates: On April 7th of this year, member Huachang Stem and Slicing Factory and others jointly requested the government to reduce the export tax on semi-finished stems, boxes, and slices and the import tax on poplar raw materials, and to increase the import tax on foreign semi-finished products in order to replenish the national treasury and protect industry. Recently, the factory and others sent a letter stating (see above for details). Poplar and American poplar can only be used to manufacture stems and cannot be used as building materials and are also prone to rot, as stated above. The domestic overproduction and the intrusion of foreign goods have been stated in the previous submission. However, the comparison of the new and old tax rates was omitted. It is appropriate to supplement the document and use it as a reason to request a tax reduction. We humbly request your consideration and prompt action to classify building materials and stem materials separately to reduce the tax rate on stems and avoid industrial stagnation and worker unemployment. We await your urgent orders. The association also listed the comparison of new and old tariffs: (1) Import raw material tax: before the tax was added, poplar cost 6.78 yuan per thousand square feet, including surcharges; after the new tariff was set, poplar cost 12 yuan per thousand square feet, including surcharges. (2) Export tax on domestic semi-finished stems: before the tax was added, each dan was valued at 3.5 taels of customs silver, and each package of 190 catties was valued at 10.036 yuan, with a 7.5% tax of 0.777 yuan. After the new tariff was set, each dan was valued at 7 taels of customs silver, and each package of 190 catties was valued at 20.073 yuan, with a 7.5% tax of 1.5 yuan. (3) Import tax on foreign semi-finished stems: after the new tariff was set, each dan was valued at 7 taels of customs silver, and each package of 170 catties was valued at 18.54 yuan, with a 7.5% tax of 1.39 yuan."</p>

<p>Jiangnan Paper Co., Ltd. held its 8th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders at 2:00 PM on the 21st, at a location on Weihaiwei Road. The meeting included reports on the company's business operations for the past year, summaries of income and expenses, expansion plans, and a proposal to retroactively approve the additional issuance of new shares. Concurrently, a temporary shareholders' meeting was held to report on the circumstances of the additional share capital issuance, amendments to the company's articles of association, and the re-election of directors and supervisors. As a result, Wu Yaoting, Yu Qiaqing, Zheng Shouzhi, Wu Jiqing, Zhang Jichen, Zhang Oufang, Sun Hongfen, Xie Meicun, and Xia Shaotang were elected as directors, and Guo Waifeng and Wu Jinqing were elected as supervisors. The annual general meeting was attended by 106 shareholder households, representing 19,835 shares, while the temporary meeting was attended by 124 shareholder households, representing 55,575 shares, both exceeding the legally required quorum.</p>

<p>Following the wave of strikes at the Mei Ya Silk Factory, and after the Party and government issued a notice ordering a return to work, all workers at the main factory complied. In other locations, such as Factory No. 2 on Jiaotong Road, Factories No. 3 and 4 on Jiaozhou Road, Factory No. 5 on Luban Road, Factory No. 8 on Xietu Road, and Factory No. 9 in Xujiahui, a small number of workers returned to work. However, at Factory No. 6 on Xietu Road, Factory No. 7 on Qu Zhenren Road, and Factory No. 10 at Bazhi Bridge, all workers continued to strike. At 9:40 AM yesterday, over 300 workers marched to the City Party Headquarters at Fenglin Bridge to petition, sending representatives to present their views and make four demands: (1) Party and government authorities should be responsible for immediately releasing the arrested representatives; (2) The factory should continue to provide food and lodging as usual; (3) The factory should not dismiss any workers after they return to work; (4) The City Party Headquarters should send personnel to lead the resumption of work tomorrow (i.e., today). Long Peiyun, a staff member from the Department of Civil Training of the Headquarters, met with the workers and accepted their demands, responding as follows: (1) The Party Headquarters would find a way to bail out the arrested representatives after the workers returned to work; (2) The factory would be notified to continue providing food and lodging; (3) The situation would be reported to protect the workers; (4) The Party Headquarters would issue another notice ordering a return to work. The representatives relayed the responses to the workers, who deemed them satisfactory, and dispersed at 1:30 PM.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency report stated that the Chinese Aviation Association's fundraising of 200,000 yuan from the hotel industry for aviation national salvation, collected as half a percent of room rates, was a voluntary donation from the hotel industry. The proposed method was submitted to the Municipal Government and commenced on the 15th of this month. However, yesterday morning, newspapers reported that the Municipal Council believed the compulsory donation violated the regulations of the Foreign Concession and interfered. A reporter inquired with the Municipal Government, which stated that the hotel donation was voluntary and not enforced by the government. It was also stated that there was no indication of interference from the Municipal Council, and the newspaper reports were likely rumors. According to the fundraising office, hotels have begun collecting donations, with hotels such as Da Zhonghua handling it seriously, while others are taking a wait-and-see approach. The office will send personnel to encourage and urge them. It was also reported that D-class hotels are enthusiastically donating three yuan per month, and C-class hotels requested to be downgraded for donation purposes, to which the office agreed on a compromise of six yuan per month, which has been approved and implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Submit Letter to the Municipal Council, Requesting Strict Crackdown on Arbitrary License Confiscation <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Chen Guoliang and others, representatives of Shanghai rickshaw pullers, yesterday submitted a letter to Mr. Zhong Siyun, Director-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council, regarding the issue of license confiscation, which has recently become increasingly severe, causing unbearable suffering for rickshaw pullers. They requested improved treatment for relief. The letter stated that rickshaw pullers rely solely on pulling rickshaws for a living, and once their licenses are confiscated, they are forced to stop working. Not only is the rickshaw rent not reduced, but they are also questioned by rickshaw owners and foremen. Rickshaw pullers are not careful, leading to various disputes and causing endless impact on their livelihoods. This is all due to the Municipal Council's license confiscation policy. However, regarding whether a license should be confiscated, according to numerous rickshaw pullers, in the past, there was a set time for confiscations, but now, regardless of the time of day, police officers are seen patrolling and confiscating licenses even after 10 PM, even when the quota for confiscations has been met. They disregard the livelihood of the weak nation's rickshaw pullers and deliberately oppress them, confiscating licenses at every opportunity. Furthermore, in the past, licenses could be retrieved immediately after confiscation, but now, it takes three to four days, six to seven days, or even more than ten days to retrieve them, with deliberate obstruction. Rickshaw pullers suffer every day they cannot work. Recently, the arbitrary confiscation of licenses by the police officers has harmed the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers, and so on. Representatives were moved to tears upon hearing this. Recalling that rickshaw pullers come to Shanghai to make a living due to rural bankruptcy, they lack capital for trade and have no one to help them find work, so they have no choice but to pull rickshaws, which is a difficult and laborious task, deserving of pity. The police officers arbitrarily confiscate licenses and arbitrarily fine rickshaw pullers' hard-earned money, and also delay their working hours, causing them various hardships. The association has repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Council Director-General to crack down on this issue. Since October of last year, upon receiving the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee's proposal on improving the rickshaw industry, the committee has prioritized the relief of rickshaw pullers. However, since then, not only has there been no improvement in the treatment and relief of rickshaw pullers, but the police officers' means of confiscating licenses have become even more severe. It is questionable whether this aligns with the original intention of relieving rickshaw pullers, and whether such a quota for license confiscations is legal. Recently, it has been found that at least hundreds of licenses are confiscated every day, and the period of confiscation has been extended. On average, the number of unemployed rickshaw pullers is alarming. If this continues, the unemployed rickshaw pullers, especially those with families, will inevitably starve and resort to desperate measures. Regarding the issue of license confiscation, the following improvements in treatment are requested: (1) If there are no damages or defects in the rickshaw, please do not be overly critical and arbitrarily confiscate the license, to avoid losses to the rickshaw pullers; (2) If the rickshaw needs to be confiscated, please repair it immediately and return it upon inspection, without detaining it and delaying working hours, to avoid hindering the rickshaw pullers' livelihoods; (3) Please allow rickshaw pullers to carry luggage, trunks, and other items, in addition to removing iron and wooden objects and items that hinder hygiene, to maintain their business. Therefore, they earnestly request the Director-General to review the above situation, treat the impoverished rickshaw pullers with compassion, and order the Traffic Department to strictly crack down on the arbitrary confiscation of licenses by the police officers and the harsh fines imposed on rickshaw pullers' hard-earned money. They would be extremely grateful and eagerly await orders.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency report stated that more than ten Japanese naval officers stationed in Shanghai took the Shanghai-Nanjing express train from Shanghai to Suzhou at 8 AM yesterday for sightseeing, planning to return to Shanghai the same day. The Municipal Government arranged the train tickets for the Japanese officers, leading to the misunderstanding that Mayor Wu was also going to Suzhou.</p>

<p>The Shanhai Marble Factory, located at 120 Renji Road, Shanghai, has an attached American Art Stone Products Department, operated by experts Su Guangming, Zhang Ruiliu, Zhou Boxiu, and Lan Baohe, in conjunction with artists Chen Qiucao and Chen Jian. Mr. Su and others, recognizing that modern products must have an aesthetic form to meet contemporary needs, and that imported marble products, although beautiful, are often priced prohibitively high, seek to create artistic products that rival imported goods and meet modern requirements. They select high-quality marble materials and meticulously craft various American artistic products. Chen and others design the products, including daily necessities such as clocks, lamps, smoking sets, bottles, and boxes, gift stone shields, stationery items such as penholders, letter racks, inkwells, paperweights, and paper knives, as well as various art decorations, all of which are perfect and unparalleled. Prices are kept low. Marble carvings are inherently rich and elegant, unmatched by other materials. These are nationally produced creations. It is heard that several companies and banks have selected goods from the department, and lamps are being sold by major companies and electrical material stores. Stationery will also be available in major bookstores. The department also welcomes visitors.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Preliminary Announcement of Yuan Yi Bank's Opening: The Realization of a Brand-New Financial Enterprise; A Tool for the Development of Industry and Commerce <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is the center of finance and commerce in the country, a metropolis where talents converge. All economic facilities and the development of industrial and commercial enterprises nationwide are based in Shanghai. Preparations for design, fundraising, and material procurement are completed in Shanghai before being carried out in various regions in sequence. Therefore, various economic organizations and material equipment are relatively complete in Shanghai. However, compared to advanced countries in Europe and America, they are still far behind. Large-scale and high-asset businesses, such as finance, trade, and insurance, are controlled by foreigners. Domestic investors who wish to invest in emerging businesses have no way to do so. If they entrust foreigners to manage their businesses, they will have to watch foreign stewards reap profits. As General Sun Yat-sen estimated, China loses an unknown number of tens of thousands of yuan each year due to foreign exchange transactions. In recent years, domestic investors have been able to work harder in new businesses, and have been able to recover some rights. In recent years, domestic investors have been paying increasing attention to investments in foreign securities and goods transactions. However, this enterprise is absolutely controlled by foreigners, and domestic investors cannot step beyond the bounds. A few months ago, it was heard that financial giants in Shanghai were planning to establish such an enterprise. Recently, it was learned that the purpose of Shao Changchun and Ge Zheisheng's trip to Europe and America was indeed for this matter. According to reliable sources, Yuan Yi Bank, organized by Hua Shang giants Wang Boyuan, He Gusheng, Liang Chenlan, Qi Shaozhai, Wang Zisong, Shao Changchun, Ge Zheisheng, and others, who raised huge amounts of capital and united the financial community, is almost ready and will open soon. The capital and scale of the bank are very large, with one million yuan already raised, and it is of unlimited nature. The scope of its business is extremely broad, handling all kinds of domestic and foreign government bonds, securities, and goods transactions, and providing agency services for buying and selling, which is especially welcome. The reason why Mr. Wang and others are willing to invest huge amounts of capital, overcome difficulties, and boldly decide to establish this business, despite the competition from foreign merchants, is that they have reached a proper agreement with the New York Chinese Chamber of Commerce's well-known cotton yarn, wheat, securities, and commodities exchange, as well as the Chicago Board of Trade. They have also specially appointed Mr. Mund, a giant in the New York securities industry, as their agent. At the same time, Shao and Ge competed for the position and negotiated in New York, and finally won the election as brokers. This is truly an unprecedented honor for Chinese merchants. Shao and Ge have already obtained the positions of brokers in the New York Cotton Exchange, the New York Commodities Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Trade. This is truly a groundbreaking feat for the Chinese business community, and the international commercial credit standing will be increased from now on. In the past, transactions had to go through Japanese or other foreign hands, but now Yuan Yi Bank can directly trade with foreign countries. Therefore, the establishment of Yuan Yi Bank not only adds a brand-new financial enterprise domestically, but also adds a lot of glory to the international position. The development and growth of Yuan Yi Bank should be celebrated by the Chinese people. It is hoped that national business leaders will work together and support each other to reverse the trend and consolidate the foundation of domestic commerce. It is understood that all the preparations for the bank are almost complete, and it will be officially opened in a short period of time. From now on, it will be a unique presence in the financial community, benefiting both the national economy and the people's livelihood. All of this is due to the efforts of Mr. Wang, Shao, and Ge.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Truth Behind the Joffre Road Assassination: Accomplice Qian Qichang Arrested in Zhenjiang and Escorted to Shanghai; Principal Offender Tan Lengyu Fled to Guangdong, but His Whereabouts Are Unknown; Victim Sang British Songs at the Time of the Murder, and the Deceased Fang Also Echoed. It Was Unexpected That the Number of Deaths With the Hammers With Song <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhongxin, a 26-year-old Cantonese Catholic residing on the upper floor of Huaan Western Restaurant, Door No. 2, Wufeng Lane, at the intersection of Rue Joffre and Rue Massenet, French Concession, was the son of Chen Daxi, also known as Chen Youle, a 60-year-old prominent overseas Chinese businessman from Nanyang who owned a vast cocoa plantation in Rabaul. He also had a younger sister residing in Western Australia, who possessed considerable wealth. Chen graduated from the engineering department of the University of Bristol in England and qualified as an engine engineer. He came to Shanghai to do business and worked as an employee of the British Students' Association at 27 Beijing Road. Unexpectedly, at around 8 AM on the 27th of last month, he was lured out and invited to the second floor of the parlor of the home of the Russian couple Bofoulaus, No. 28, Bao Ren Lane, 697 Route Massenet. He was then attacked with a hammer by the murderer.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Injured in the Back of the Head <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>After being killed, the murderer, in an attempt to destroy the body, eliminate traces of the crime, wrapped all the quilts and clothes around the corpse, poured kerosene, and set it on fire. The murderer then took the opportunity to escape. It was discovered by the sub-landlord and waiter Chen Nianru. They initially thought that the tenant had gone out and that a fire had broken out in the room due to carelessness, and reported it to the fire department, who rushed to extinguish the fire. Later, it was discovered that the body had been burned, with the head and face charred and blurred. After receiving the report, the French patrol sent a detective to send the corpse to the autopsy center of the Tongren Fuyuan branch. The Second Special District Court sent someone to examine the body. Chen Tianbao, the nephew of the deceased (a monk at the Tushan Bay Monastery), was issued a warrant. As this strange murder occurred, it has</p>

<p>People paid attention. The French Patrol also considered the case to be serious and ordered detectives to search for the murderer. It was not until the 4th of this month that they found a clue. Jin Jiulin, the detective superintendent of the special agency of the French Patrol, learned that Qian Qichang, an accomplice in the case, had fled back to his home in the countryside of Xu'er Town, Land Temple Township, Zhenjiang. He immediately reported to the detective chief and took the detectives Qian Yumin and Zhou Bingcheng, and the detective Liu Dianlong, and rushed to Zhenjiang on the Beijing-Shanghai train overnight. They arrested Qian in cooperation with the local Public Security Bureau. He was transferred to Shanghai on the 5th and taken to the Second Special District Court for questioning the next day. At that time, according to Qian's confession, the main culprit, Tan Lengyu, a Cantonese, had fled to 101 Huixing Road, Guangzhou. Superintendent Jin led the original detectives to</p>
<h3 id="e182">Guangdong to Arrest <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>However, because the matter was confidential, it was inconvenient to publish it in the newspapers. It is now known that the detectives who went to Guangdong arrived in Guangzhou, but the suspect had already fled elsewhere. They then went to Kowloon, Hong Kong, and other places to investigate, but still found no trace of him. The detectives had no choice but to return to Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to a report, the patrol sent the accomplice Qian Qichang to the Second Special Court yesterday, and summoned the related Chinese and Russian witnesses for questioning. At 10:30 AM, Judge Xiong Huiping and clerk Tao Zongkan took the bench in the first criminal court for interrogation. First, the patrol lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case and the patrol's investigation of Qian. He charged Qian with assisting in murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. When asked, Qian Qichang confessed that he was 23 years old from Zhenjiang. He was in office during the tenth month of the first year.</p>

<p>Arrested and sentenced to four months imprisonment, fined five hundred yuan, and detained in Caohejing Prison. Around mid-December, a Cantonese man named Tan Lengyu, also known as Tan Musheng, came to the prison and shared my cell, thus we became acquainted. He said he was arrested and sentenced to four months for stealing four thousand silver dollars from a friend. Inadvertently, I mentioned that I had a friend, Jin Yaozong, who lived at No. 24 Lixian Lane, Zilaihuo Street. This February, I was released and temporarily resided in the attic of Jin Yaozong's house. On March 21st, I moved to the Gongzheng Law Firm at No. 17 Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road, staying for about a week. On the fifth day of the first lunar month, Tan also completed his sentence and was released. He visited me at Lixian Lane, learned I was not there, and then met me at Qinghefang. He then invited me to room 259 of the Dongfang Hotel on Xizang Road. When I went there in the afternoon, I saw that</p>
<h3 id="e184">There Were Already Two People <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>inside. Tan introduced me to one, Chen Zhongxin, and the other, a man surnamed Lin. They spoke in a different dialect, and I didn't know what they were talking about. The next day, I visited Tan again, asking him to help me find work. Tan said he would return to Guangdong and then come back to Shanghai to open an umbrella factory, where he could find a position for me in the future. On March 20th, Tan came to Shanghai and rented a room at the Dafang Hotel, using the alias Chen Jili. The next day, I went there. Tan said he would open a hospital at No. 28 Baoren Lane, Xiafei Road. Then, Tan went to rent the house. On the 26th, Tan said his brother had bought a new car and needed to buy gasoline. At nine o'clock on the morning of the 27th, Tan came to Qinghefang with a lead bucket, asking me to go with him. On the way, Tan told me that he had recently been defamed by a friend and</p>
<h3 id="e185">Intended to Kill Him <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>otherwise he couldn't establish himself in Shanghai. If anything unfortunate happened, he asked me to tell his family. I dismissed it with a laugh. In the afternoon, I bought two gallons of gasoline on Fuxu Road. On the way, Tan gave me a check for 38.4 yuan, instructing me to go to the China Travel Service under the YMCA at Baxianqiao to exchange it for a boat ticket. I agreed. Around one o'clock, I received a call from Tan, ordering me to meet him at his residence. When I went there, he wasn't there. I went outside and saw Tan coming with Chen Zhongxin. I went upstairs with them again. Tan and Chen went into the bathroom for a long time before coming out. Tan told me to play chess with Chen while he sang British songs, with Chen joining in. Tan was reading a book beside them, pacing behind Chen from time to time. Soon, Tan took a hammer wrapped in cloth and</p>

<p>Chen turned his head in pain. Tan struck him several more times. Seeing the situation was bad, I stepped forward to stop him and was injured on my little finger. I was shocked and went outside, tearing up the paper for exchanging the boat ticket on the way. I took temporary refuge at Chen's store, Laoda Fang, on Zhejiang Road. The next day, I saw news of the incident in the newspaper and knew things were bad. Fearing being implicated, I borrowed twenty yuan from Chen and returned to my hometown in Zhenjiang, and sent a letter to Jin Yaozong, telling him what had happened. Then I was arrested in my hometown, etc. After questioning, the official ordered the coroner Chen Tianbao, Chen Tianxiang, and witnesses Russian Boflauv, Youliaiv, Chinese Chen Nianru, Lin Qingkun, Jin Yaozong, Xu Jiugong (aka Zhu Chaojun), and others to be brought to court for questioning one by one. It was already past noon, and the court adjourned the trial to May 1st.</p>

<p>The Taizhou, a ship belonging to the Taizhou Shipping Company at No. 310 Magong Road, outside Guan Bridge in the Nanshi District, usually travels between Shanghai, Taizhou, and Haimen. In early May of the lunar calendar last year, the ship departed from Shen and set sail for Taizhou. Unexpectedly, at around nine o'clock that evening, while traveling five li from Haimen, a well-known pirate leader, Xu Xiaomei, along with dozens of accomplices, arrived in pirate ships, boarded the ship, ordered it to stop, and began a robbery. The crew and passengers on board were robbed, suffering significant losses. The pirates then loaded the stolen goods onto their pirate ships and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the ship owner reported the incident to the Haimen County government for investigation. However, nearly a year has passed, and the case remains unsolved. Unexpectedly, the pirate leader Xu Xiaomei, disguised as a merchant, boarded the ship in Shanghai yesterday, mixing with the passengers heading to Haimen, intending to commit further crimes. Fortunately, a tea server on board discovered her and secretly reported to the escort team, who immediately arrested Xu and sent her to the Haimen County government for severe punishment.</p>

<p>Jia Zhentang, a 48-year-old Shaoxing native living at No. 4 Luyanqing Lane, Muddy Beach Police Station, Pudong, was a small vendor. He had a son named Jia Rongquan, 21 years old, who worked in a cigarette factory, but his income was meager and barely sufficient for his own needs. The family was poor and had many mouths to feed, leading to frequent financial difficulties. In recent years, they had incurred further expenses for weddings and funerals, resulting in debts of over one hundred yuan to three or four creditors. Despite paying high interest rates, they were unable to repay the principal. Now, facing pressure from creditors, Jia, who had difficulty saving even from his food expenses to pay the interest, was unable to repay the principal immediately. However, the iron-faced creditors, like wolves and tigers, relentlessly pressured the poor man, making it impossible for Jia to cope. In a moment of desperation, he secretly bought a large amount of poison, likely opium, and committed suicide. He groaned and bled, and the poison had already penetrated deeply. He refused to tell his family, but his family, noticing his sudden and strange illness, realized he had taken poison and rushed him to Pudong Hospital for treatment. However, due to the depth of the poison and the passage of time, and because the poor family lacked the resources to transfer him to a more expensive hospital in Puxi, he died that night. His family still doesn't know what kind of poison he ingested. The Third District Police Station learned of the incident and ordered the local bailiff Yao Hongsheng to report it to the local court for verification. The deceased's son, Jia Rongquan, grieved over his father's tragic death, feeling that his own lack of effort in earning a living had caused his father's unrest in death. He submitted a tearful petition to the court, requesting that an autopsy be waived.</p>

<p>Xiangmao New Cloth Shop, located at the entrance of Lishe West Lane, Lishe Caichang opposite the South Railway Station on Lujiabang Road, was about to close at around eight o'clock the previous evening. Suddenly, two young women entered the shop to buy clothing material. The shop, naturally, attended to these customers as they came at night, and did not close the doors. The women chose silk fabrics worth over forty yuan. The shop clerk took the money to the counter. As the clerk was balancing the accounts, the women left. Suddenly, three robbers wearing long gowns broke in, pointed guns at the cashier, and ransacked the open cash register, taking over one hundred yuan in cash and a gold ring from a shop employee before fleeing. After the shop employees recovered from their shock, they reported the incident to the Lujiabang Police Station, which dispatched officers to the scene. However, the robbers had already vanished without a trace. The incident was reported to the Second District Headquarters for investigation. It is suspected that the women who made the purchase were part of the gang, acting as scouts to facilitate the robbery.</p>

<p>Hu Shanqing, the son of the late Hangzhou tycoon Hu Ganqing, and a shareholder in the Hu Qingyutang Pharmacy on Beijing Road and the Fuchang Ginseng Shop on Xian Gua Street in the Nanshi District, had a residence at No. 50 Guling Road. Recently, Xue, Hu's third concubine, and their daughter, Qiaoyun, hired a lawyer to file a civil lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Hu Shanqing of not handing over the inheritance, demanding a division of 300,000 yuan, with Qiaoyun entitled to one-third, or 100,000 yuan, and 14,580 yuan for living expenses. The defendant, Hu Shanqing, hired lawyers Lin Yingqing and Lu Shaozong to defend him, arguing that Qiaoyun was not Hu Ganqing's biological daughter and had no right to inherit property. The court advised both parties to reach a settlement, but it failed. A sentencing date was set. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, Judge Shen Hong presided over the court, ruling that the defendant should pay the plaintiff, Hu Xue, 100 yuan per month in alimony, starting from February of this year. The alimony for the second, third, and fourth months should be reported immediately. The lawsuit of the plaintiff, Hu Qiaoyun, and the remaining claims of the plaintiff, Hu Xue, were dismissed.</p>

Director Wen, upon receiving the order, along with Chen Zhuomin, commander of the First Regiment of the Security Corps, visited the injured parties at the Yue Min Hospital on North Sichuan Road at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday to express their condolences. Li Dingzhong, the second station chief of the Seventh District, who witnessed the assault but failed to suppress it, was deemed to have disregarded his duties and was removed from his position for investigation. Pei Chengzhu, the third platoon leader, was transferred to Wusong yesterday and also given appropriate punishment. Commander Chen believed that the soldiers who caused the trouble had violated military discipline and had been handed over to the Security Department for strict punishment. Director Yang, in order to rectify the discipline of his subordinates, transferred the soldiers to the Songhu Garrison Command for legal action. The company was satisfied and has urged workers to resume normal transportation.

<h3 id="e205">The Crisis and Relief of China's Cotton Cloth Industry <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Rongchu</p>
<p>Cotton cloth is a necessity of life. Given the large population of the country and the expansion of consumption, it occupies an important position in national economics and international trade. Therefore, any drastic changes in national and world economics will inevitably affect China's cotton cloth industry. Domestic political changes and market prosperity and decline are directly affected. Even changes in the world economy and shifts in international relations will affect China's cotton cloth industry. During the European War, the cotton cloth industry temporarily broke free from the hegemony of imperialist economic forces and once flourished. Since the end of the European War, it has been subject to the long-term exploitation of imperialism every day. Up to the present, the situation of rural bankruptcy has been expanding, the resources of the national economy have been depleted, and ceaseless military and political turmoil, inland communication, and transportation have fallen into long-term obstruction. Under the attack of internal troubles and external invasions, the cotton cloth industry has fallen into extreme panic. Based on observations, the crises in China's cotton cloth industry are described below, hoping that compatriots across the country will be deeply aware.</p>
<p>(1) The Fall of the Northeast and the Sino-Japanese Shanghai War</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast market has been plundered by Japanese imperialists. The puppet organization, acting under the command of Japanese imperialism, erected strict tariff barriers, preventing cotton cloth from inland China from being sold to the three northeastern provinces. Consequently, cotton cloth factories that usually relied on the three northeastern provinces as their market saw sluggish sales, accumulated inventories, and fell into difficulty. They had no choice but to engage in suicidal competition, leading to a further decline in market prices. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, some Shanghai cotton cloth factories have been destroyed by artillery fire, while others have been affected by financial stagnation and cannot resume operations. Social economics have suffered huge losses of 140 million yuan, and the people's purchasing power has become even weaker. Therefore, the Northeast Incident and the January 28th Shanghai War have had a significant impact on China's industry, especially the cotton cloth industry.</p>
<p>(2) World Economic Panic and Dumping Policies</p>
<p>Since the tide of recession swept across the world, imperialist countries have been unable to remedy their own economic contradictions and have resorted to dumping policies as a last-ditch effort. China's cotton cloth industry has suffered even greater losses under the dumping policies of imperialism. Consumers only enjoy a few petty cheap benefits, while organic cotton cloth production organizations are broken up separately. In particular, Japanese imperialism has been deliberately plotting. After seizing our Northeast market, it is implementing active dumping in mainland China. Japanese merchants generally have abundant capital, low interest rates, complete equipment, superb technology, harmonious labor relations, and convenient transportation. The government also protects them. Therefore, in the past ten years, they have defeated Britain and the United States within China, aiming to monopolize the Chinese market, and wanting to keep all the people of China in a perpetual state of exploitation to satisfy their desires.

<h3 id="e206">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item published in your newspaper on the 21st of this month concerning the assault by soldiers of the security team and police officers of the Third Company of the Police Brigade on drivers and ticket sellers of the China Merchants Public Bus Company, resulting in a work slowdown, it is not consistent with the facts. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, at 5:30 PM, four soldiers of the First Regiment of our Security Team, Ji Deshan, He Zhijun, Zeng Yuhuan, and Jiang Hongtai, had a misunderstanding with ticket sellers of a public bus in Section 5 of the 5th District, leading to a dispute. It was then immediately explained, and the matter was resolved. According to a letter from the company providing definitive proof, the incident of assaulting public bus drivers in Section 2 of the 7th District at 7:30 PM that afternoon, after investigation, was not committed by soldiers of this office. The China Merchants Bus Company has also provided a letter confirming that no soldiers from this office were involved, and the location and time were different from the previous incident. They were two completely separate matters, with no correlation whatsoever. The news item conflated the two, which is clearly inaccurate. Accordingly, a copy of the company's original letter is enclosed, requesting that your newspaper investigate and make the correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Security Office</p>
<p>Enclosed: One copy of the original letter</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for your office's dispatch of Chief Wang Chengzhilin to our company to express condolences. The dispute between our company and the soldiers of your office in Section 5 of the 5th District in Jiangwan yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM was a misunderstanding on both sides, and the matter was immediately explained. As for the assault on our company employees at Section 2 of the 7th District at approximately 7:00 PM, according to reports, no soldiers from your office were involved. The assailants were entirely members of the public, and it is a suspicious case. Our company intends to investigate the matter as the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau. Thank you for your inquiry. Respectfully submitted for your review.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e209">Reading "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Of course, this is not to say that "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" has already grasped the spirit of the times, or that "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" has fulfilled its profound social significance; on the contrary, "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" has not achieved this point. A great work with social significance, whether its depiction is on the affirmative side or the negative side, whether it exposes the sins of the declining class or inspires the growth of the emerging class, should exert its positivity as much as possible, and should set off the advancing social trend from that complex social life. However, what "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" grasps and describes are only some social bas-reliefs; passive, distorted, chaotic, and unintentional. Thus, in the structure of the whole story, it also forms a kind of "accidental" hodgepodge, unable to escape the trap of the legendary novel, "the performance is off track, unless the gods come to the rescue." Guan Xiugu in the style of "Thirteenth Sister" and Shou Feng who "exercises righteousness" appear only to complete those scenes of "weeding out the treacherous in the mountain temple" and "escaping the demon cave." Writing the Jianghu performers of Tianqiao into chivalrous figures like "divine dragons" who eliminate the strong and support the weak is already beyond reality, and attributing the fate of the evil warlords to the hand of a female knight "who exists in the sky but not in the world" is even more self-evident in its distortion of reality and escape from reality. "The Tale of Laughter and Tears," in terms of its social significance and in terms of its artistic evaluation, is a failure. It only superficially captures some fragmented social scenes, without selecting or refining them at all, and presenting the characteristics of that specific social life.</p>
<p>So, how does "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" catch its readers? As mentioned earlier, China's deformed society is reflected in people's lives and thoughts, also becoming deformed. Although what "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" captures are some bas-reliefs, this kind of fusion of different lifestyles of "ancient and modern" for thousands of years is precisely the place where it can cater to the tastes of the general floating urban class. The readers of "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" are undoubtedly those floating and unstable urban residents and the general bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>In a turbulent era, in the transition period from one society to another, the petty-bourgeois urban class is on the one hand pursuing the life of the bourgeois class who are addicted to pleasure, and on the other hand hating the evil society of the present. In "The Tale of Laughter and Tears," this kind of mass psychology just happens to project an stimulant.</p>
<p>The keynote of life depicted in "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" is full of the atmosphere of the enjoyment of life among bureaucrats and nobles. Not only is it not unusual for General Liu and others to spend a lot of money, but also the thirty or forty yuan for a pair of shoes for Mrs. Tao and the monthly thousand yuan for Miss He Lina to buy flowers can only make Fan Jiashu ashamed that he has "never seen the world." This extremely luxurious life is precisely the life that the general petty citizens pursue. However, what we should point out here is that the author completely ignores the negative aspects and only focuses on the affirmative description, only noticing its static posture, and not grasping its active direction. The luxurious life of aristocratic bureaucrats is only their own afterglow, another manifestation of their gradual collapse. The author does not develop the story in this way, but only evasively injects a kind of civilian thought into Fan Jiashu, causing him to avoid the noble and fashionable He Lina, and to love Shen Fengxi, who is involved in the dust; the result is that it emphasizes even more that He Lina also breaks away from her rich man, to the ultimate goal of "the gasoline lamplight in that room shines on a pair of figures, printed on the purple curtain." This method of expression just happens to cater to the psychology of those petty-citizen classes. In their journey to pursue the life of the bourgeois class, because of the limitations of social conditions, they encounter insurmountable obstacles, so they feel sad, so they feel disgusted, but they dare not seek a solution head-on. In helplessness, civilian thought inevitably becomes their self-consolation.</p>
<p>Like other martial arts love novels, "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" can also inject some temporary pleasure into the petty-bourgeois urban class. In China, the tyranny and cruelty of warlord bureaucrats, such as forcibly occupying Shen Fengxi, is the most common thing, and also the most infuriating thing. But most of China's petty bourgeoisie has a cowardly character. Characters like Ah Q fill this middle layer. They dare not face reality head-on, dare not raise their fists to fight in practice, so even if they are dissatisfied, even if they harbor resentment, they can only close themselves in the house and "swear at the sky and scold the earth" as a spiritual victory. This phenomenon, when expressed in politics, becomes the illusion of hoping for the appearance of a chivalrous person who eliminates the strong and helps the weak. In this book, Guan Shoufeng's loyalty and helping friends out of trouble, and Guan Xiugu's risking her life to "eliminate traitors for the people" can be said to be the scenes that make people feel the most happy. It is a pity that this kind of "weeding out traitors in the mountain temple" is neither something that exists in the present society, nor can it be used as a creed to enlighten the masses. This is just a drug made by writers who are influenced by the ruling class in feudal society to anesthetize the masses, and the author of "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" accepted this legacy without any reservations. On this point, the author of "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" cannot but say "it is truly regrettable."</p>
<p>In addition, "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" also embellishes some episodes of joys and sorrows, Fan Jiashu's initial "tender affection" with Shen Fengxi, and finally "splitting the volume and flying the moth," all of which are in line with the life interests of the bourgeois class.</p>
<p>The above can be said to have explained the reasons why "The Tale of Laughter and Tears" can be popular for a while. The author has completely seen through the floating psychology of the upper and middle social classes, and has fulfilled his responsibility in anesthetizing the masses and distorting reality. Because of this, we should further examine what the central idea it expresses is. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e213">It is a Comprehensive Test of China's Athletics Before the Far East Games <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast, Baihong, and Combined teams will hold a triangular sports meet at the China Athletic Field starting at 2:00 PM today. The Northeast team has a total of nine members, seven of whom are representatives to the Far East Games. The Baihong team has more than twenty members, four of whom are representatives to the Far East Games. The combined team has thirteen members, all of whom are representatives to the Far East Games. Except for Yang Daogui and Liu Yingjun, who are staying in Beijing, all the national heroes are here.</p>
<p>This大会 aims to show that the people of the Northeast have not lost their hearts and to provide a test before the Far East Games. The members of each team will individually exert their abilities as much as possible to achieve excellent records. The so-called confrontation and the so-called triangle are only for self-deprecation.</p>
<p>According to the Far East Games preliminary competition last week, the spring was cold, and the athletes had just removed their dust. Therefore, most of the results failed to meet the ardent expectations of the people of the country. After the weather warmed up, the runner-up in the high jump, Wang Shilin, surpassed the record set by champion Wu Bixian in one fell swoop. It is a pity that such a rare competition of national heroes was hampered by weather and human factors and could not be fully utilized. Recently, the weather has been comfortable, and the people's enthusiasm has been aroused. The athletes have restored their physical strength after a week of rest and hard training. Therefore, the beauty of today's achievements can be expected and waited for. Today's event can also be said to make up for the shortcomings of last week.</p>
<p>It is heard that each team has submitted a request to the Sports Association, requesting that responsible personnel be dispatched to the venue to inspect the results to prepare for future requests for recognition.</p>

<p>The China College team, the leader of the Beiping basketball league, went to Zhenru yesterday to compete with Jinan. Although the Northern Army has been fighting against John and Jiaotong in recent days and has been strong, the soldiers are exhausted. Jinan's Old Huang Zhong Huang Zhaolin and Xu Rongshui are making a comeback, and their strength has greatly increased. They are also waiting for work with ease and are performing very skillfully. The Northern Army made a last-ditch effort and failed due to exhaustion, not because of the battle. In the first half, the situation was tense, with Jinan leading by two points, 18 to 16. In the second half, Jinan was even stronger. The Northern Army was exhausted and struggling to cope. As a result, Jinan won 42 to 32.</p>

<p>Overall Result: China United Wins 6 to 4</p>
<p>Members of the Shanghai Chinese and Western Referee Association held a football match at Shenyuan yesterday. Admission tickets were six corners each, and the proceeds were donated to the Catholic Youth Association for charity. There were only about 300 spectators. Many of the players in both teams were famous generals from the past, and their play was satisfactory. Western United was intimidating and led 3 to 2 in the first half. In the second half, they scored first again, making it 4 to 2. The Chinese team was in a precarious situation, but thanks to their final efforts, they reversed the defeat and won 6 to 4.</p>

<p>After the start of the match, the Western Union team launched a surprise attack, catching the Chinese team off guard. Pennell scored the first goal, barely two minutes after the kickoff. Two minutes later, Pennell scored again. The Chinese team, not to be outdone, launched a swift counterattack. With Lu Zhong'en's assistance, Dong Xiaopei shot from 20 yards out, and the Western Union goalkeeper fumbled the save. Later, from a corner kick, Pennell headed the ball in, and Lao Zhou lost control, putting Western Union ahead 3-2.</p>

<p>During halftime, the veteran players had a hearty drink and continued the battle. After several rounds, neither side could score. Following a fifteen-minute stalemate, a Western Union player broke through and scored a goal, putting the Chinese team in a precarious 2-4 deficit. The players gave their all, launching a courageous counterattack. Dong Xiaopei succeeded instantly, and Qu Hongren charged straight ahead, leveling the score in a flash. Half an hour later, the portly Li Laoban (Baojun) also scored a goal.

The football and basketball championships will be held in advance at the China Football Field and the City No. 1 Sports Field, respectively.

Each team will assign one linesman. Each basketball game will be 16 minutes, with teams switching sides. Each team should assign a record keeper.

<p>Divided into Land and Sea Teams to Engage in Collection</p>
<p>The Second Batch of Personnel Will Depart from Beijing</p>
<p>The Hainan Biological Collection Group, organized by the Chinese Science Society and other six academic groups, has safely arrived in Hainan Island after joining the staff of the Guangdong and Guangxi Geological Survey Institute. It has been reported before. Now it is learned that the group is divided into land and sea teams to carry out their work for the convenience of collection.</p>
<h3 id="e249">On the Land Team Side <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Led by Liu Xian, it is divided into three groups: anthropology, geology, and zoology. The leaders of the Li people are responsible for leading the work along the way. They have reached Shengyan from Wuzhi Mountain and met with the animal group. Shengyan is surrounded by mountains on all sides, 1,100 feet above sea level. The collection group set up the land team's headquarters here. The transportation here is convenient and the food is abundant, which is suitable for the collection and rest of terrestrial animals. However, it is still early, so all kinds of animals are very few. Only the specimens of reptiles and amphibians are relatively more.</p>

<p>Led by Wang Yikang, they are currently at the estuary. Huangsha Hanhan [deserted land] has very few livestock and animals. The biological collectors have nothing to be attached to. The east of the estuary is also a beach, and the coastline is especially barren and has nothing to hunt. Only the Sanya port in the south has abundant marine resources, making collection easier. After completing work at the estuary, they plan to go to Lingshui, where there are more reefs, and the harvest should be better than in the north of Yazhou. Currently, in addition to fish and shrimp, they are also collecting parasites, but the amounts are very small. It is estimated that they will reach Beili by mid-May, and then return to the estuary along the northwest coast. Within half a year, they can tour Qiongzhou Island. The second group of collectors will also depart from Nanjing for work at the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e257">The Current Situation of Secondary Education in England <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>— Zhu Zhensun</p>
<p>(VIII) Coeducation</p>
<p>In England, coeducation is rarely seen, except in some primary schools in London. However, in other places, coeducation is very common. In the whole of England, the number of coeducational schools exceeds the number of single-sex schools. This coeducation is partly to save money, but partly based on educational principles. In fact, many British educators believe that coeducation is a special stage in education.</p>
<p>(IX) Teacher Salaries</p>
<p>There are about two different standards for the salaries of secondary school teachers in England, namely those with degrees and those without degrees. For teachers with degrees, the salary ranges from £276 to £528 for men, with an annual increase of £15, up to eighteen years. For women, the salary ranges from £264 to £420, with an annual increase of £14, up to fourteen years. For teachers without degrees, the salary ranges from £204 to £432 for men, with an annual increase of £15, up to twenty years. For women, the salary ranges from £192 to £342, with an annual increase of £9, up to eighteen years. All secondary school teachers who retire between the ages of sixty and sixty-five can receive half of their total service period as a pension.</p>
<p>(X) Central Schools</p>
<p>There are about one hundred central schools in London, England. This kind of school is not a complete middle school, because it only has a four-year program, which is quite similar to our junior high school. In the first two academic years, students must study the same subjects, including modern foreign languages. In the last two academic years, students learn more knowledge in the fields of commerce or industry. The purpose of this school is to provide students with preparation for employment. The curriculum of Stanley Central School (which is more focused on industry) is described below for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Bible, (2) English, (3) German, (4) Geography, (5) History, (6) Mathematics, (7) Chemistry, (8) Physics, (9) Drawing and Art, (10) Carpentry and Metalworking, (11) Music, (12) Gymnastics.</p>
<p>Central schools are tuition-free, so many people want to enter. However, because the number of places is limited, competition is fierce. It selects students based on the results of the primary school scholarship examination that students should take at the age of eleven. Students who have not obtained a place in a middle school may be able to obtain a good position in a central school, because they still have the opportunity to participate in the central school examination at the age of thirteen. Students who have not obtained a place in either middle school or central school must enter a senior primary school for remedial studies until the age of fourteen. The work in this school is mostly manual activity.</p>
<p>Central schools can be called middle schools in terms of appearance and spirit, because the students inside are treated as adult male and female students. All the male and female teachers are also experts, and their level is the same as that of the male and female teachers in the middle schools, but their salaries are lower.</p>

<h3 id="e258">The Spirit of Martialism <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Pinjuan</p>
<p>Little friends: Do you know why we Chinese are called "sick men of East Asia" by foreigners? What a shameful title this is!</p>
<p>In the past, we Chinese valued scholars too much and despised martial artists. Therefore, not only did students who studied want to be refined people, but other people also envied being refined people. As a result, they did not pay attention to exercise or physical education, and did not exercise their bodies, making everyone weak and sickly.</p>
<p>Little friends: Think about it, a person with a body as weak as a sick man, even if he is very knowledgeable, what can he do for the country? No wonder our China is getting weaker and weaker, and no wonder foreigners ridicule us as "sick men of East Asia"! In this world of the survival of the fittest, weak nations will be eliminated, and only by having the spirit of martialism can they survive. Little friends: Do you want to wash away the shame of the "sick men of East Asia"? Do you want to create great undertakings? Do you want China to become strong? Then everyone must have the spirit of martialism!</p>
<h3 id="e259">Stone Child <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Xifu</p>
<p>Little friends, do you want to hear the story of the Stone Child? I will tell you the story now. Poor Jiading! During the Ming Dynasty, it was often disturbed by Japanese pirates who robbed things, burned houses, and killed people. The magistrate at that time, Yin Fenglin, was a confused old man who didn't know anything. The people outside the city had no choice but to escape into the city. The detestable Japanese pirates wanted to attack the city again. Fortunately, there were soldiers and common people on the city walls, guarding it day and night, so they were not able to break through.</p>
<p>One night, the people guarding the city were all too tired to sleep, and the Japanese pirates climbed up the city walls again. The people guarding the city didn't know it yet, when suddenly a child shouted loudly, "The bandits are coming! The bandits are coming!" The people guarding the city heard it and quickly got up to kill the bandits, killing quite a few of them.</p>
<p>After the bandits left, everyone went to look for the child who had shouted, but who knew that the poor child had already been killed by the bandits!</p>
<p>Later, people commemorated him by carving a stone statue of the child and erecting it on the northwest gate of Jiading City, where it is still preserved today!</p>
<h3 id="e260">Why Do Birds Fight? <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zongjie</p>
<p>Darwin once said, "The fighting of birds occurs because the males are fighting for females, which can be said to be for love." After research by many zoologists, it was only known that this statement was not very reliable. Because when they fight, the males and males, and the females and females, all join the battle, pairing off to fight. From this point of view, they are definitely not fighting for love.</p>
<p>Originally, according to Howard, the fighting of birds is for territory, which can also be said to be for food. Because after they find a suitable branch and make a nest, they will no longer allow other birds to stay here. And the area around this nest seems to be under its jurisdiction, and other birds are not allowed to forage for food. If a bird invades its sovereignty, it will definitely rise up and fight. Little friends, even birds know how to protect their territory, what should we humans do?</p>
<h3 id="e261">Tomb Sweeping <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>On a bright spring day, we left our hometown to sweep the tombs of our ancestors in the countryside.</p>
<p>We sat silently on a sturdy steamboat. At that time, the boat was very crowded, and I was squeezed inside, almost unable to breathe. There were men and women, old and young. Some were talking and laughing, some were eating, and some were leaning out the window to look at the scenery.</p>
<p>I also looked out the window and saw fields full of golden rape flowers, and rows of weeping willows swaying in the breeze on both sides of the bank.</p>
<p>We arrived at our destination. It was almost noon.</p>
<p>After passing through a dense forest, crossing several shallow swamps, and walking along uneven mountain roads, we arrived at our tomb.</p>
<p>A pile of yellow earth, this is the resting place of our ancestors. There was also a stone table placed in front of it, and we arranged the sacrificial dishes on the table. We lit incense and candles and burned paper money, kowtowing one by one.</p>
<p>At the same time, my grandmother kept saying, "May the ancestors bless our whole family with health and peace!"</p>
<p>Alas! Buried in this pile of yellow earth are several decaying coffins. The bodies of the ancestors have long since become skeletons. Life is gone too. Was what my grandmother said addressed to those skeletons? This is really a superstitious act of the old ladies.</p>
<p>Little friends, do you also have grandmothers? It's probably the same, right.</p>

<p>— Jiang Yan</p>
<p>Little friends, you can look at the picture before reading the text.</p>
<p>After looking at the picture, don't you feel that the lines in each picture are of different lengths? But, you are wrong. If you don't believe it, you can take a ruler to measure them. Let me tell you, they are all the same length.</p>
<p>After measuring them, do you have some thoughts? -- Why are eyes wrong?</p>
<p>Let me tell you, our eyes are unreliable. They often give us errors, and some are even unable to see. Therefore, next time you do anything, you should not just look with your eyes. It is necessary to use your brain to examine and consider.</p>

<p>— Zhaode</p>
<p>Little friends, aren't your school uniforms often washed? Do you hire someone to wash them? Or does your mother wash them for you? How are they after drying? Aren't they very wrinkled and unpresentable? Apart from using an iron, have you ever thought of an economic iron to iron them flat? If you haven't thought about it, now I will tell you about an economic iron that I have used before! The so-called economic iron does not need charcoal! Then you must ask, if you don't use charcoal, what do you use? What is its shape? What is it made of? Please don't panic! It is an enamelware that every family has! A tooth powder can (but it should be a little bigger). If you pour boiling water into it and close the lid, then the economic iron is successful! You can use it to iron clothes and trousers. It is not only light and convenient, but also economic, and ironing clothes is no different from a real iron!</p>
<p>Little friends, you might as well try it with your dried and wrinkled clothes!</p>

<p>His face was pale yellow, with two small, crimson lips, showing an undernourished look. But those black, shiny eyes could no longer hide his lively soul, gently, gently turning, like a pair of little lambs, endearing.</p>
<p>"Yuan"! Once I asked him: "Why are you so thin?"</p>
<p>"Sir! I don't eat often!" He lowered his head.</p>
<p>"Oh! What do you eat?"</p>
<p>"Four copper coins, two yuanzi [glutinous rice balls]!" He trembled.</p>
<p>"Don't you like to eat rice?"</p>
<p>"No, rice is late, I'm afraid I won't make it to class!" He raised his head.</p>
<p>"Doesn't your mother feel sorry for you?"</p>
<p>"My mother left me when I was two years old!" His eyes turned red, "I followed my aunt,..."</p>
<p>"What about your father?" I held him tightly.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir! Not long ago, one night, I became an or...orphan again!" He cried.</p>

<p>Wiping Slate Little friends: Does your school use slates for copying books? Do you copy the words from the books onto the slate with a slate pencil? After the slate is full of words, don't you have to wipe them off? If you use a dry piece of paper or a dry cloth to wipe it, then the slate pencil powder written on the slate will fly up; if you accidentally breathe it in, it will be harmful to your lungs. But what can you do? Just before you wipe the slate pencil marks off the slate, first pour some water on the slate, and then wipe it with paper or cloth; or directly use a wet piece of paper or a wet cloth to wipe it, it is the same. This way, the slate pencil powder will not fly up. Inkstone Little friends: If your inkstone has been used for a long time, won't there be a lot of accumulated ink around the inkstone? At this time, do you feel that it is very difficult to grind ink? And if you are not careful, when grinding ink, if the ink touches the accumulated ink on the inkstone, the ink will splash out, even splashing on your clothes. Isn't this very annoying? If you encounter this situation, I hope you quickly wash off the accumulated ink on the inkstone; then not only will it be easy to grind thick ink, but it will also save effort. P.S. If the teacher asks you to wipe the words written on the blackboard with chalk; you can do it according to the "Wiping Slate" method, then the chalk dust will not fly into your nose and mouth. Your inkstone, even if it does not have accumulated ink around it, can also be washed once every Sunday; although your hands will suffer a little, it is much better to grind ink with it than with an inkstone that has not been washed.</p>

<p>— Jin Yong</p>
<p>Little friends! Don't you like to hear stories very much? Now I will tell you one.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a woodcutter chopping trees by the river. By chance, his axe fell into the river and sank. The woodcutter lost his beloved axe and was very sad. The river god heard him. He took a golden axe from the river and gave it to him. The woodcutter did not admit that it was his original axe. The river god dived into the river again and took out a silver axe, but he still did not admit it. Finally, the river god took out the axe he had lost and gave it to him. So, he happily thanked the river god for his virtue. The river god loved him very much for being honest, so he gave him the golden axe and the silver axe as well.</p>
<p>Later, this news was known to one of his friends. He also wanted to get rich. So, he disguised himself as a woodcutter and chopped trees by the river; deliberately throwing his axe into the river. So, he sat by the river and cried loudly. The river god heard his crying and ran to ask him why he was crying? He pretended to say, "Because I lost my axe." The river god still dived into the river and took out a golden axe.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's really my axe!" He couldn't help saying in his heart:</p>
<p>The river god was furious. He scolded him fiercely for not telling the truth, and he didn't even give him the axe he had dropped!</p>
<p>Little friends! You should be honest children. In the story above, it is very clear that honesty is very beneficial to your life.</p>

<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Big Classroom</p>
<p>Dear Little Friends:</p>
<p>Where do you read? You probably all read in classrooms with doors and windows. You want to gain knowledge, and you only seek it in a stereotyped way in books. But, let me test you: I will take two stalks of wheat, one is barley, and one is wheat. Answer honestly, can you tell them apart? We often encounter plant researchers coming to the countryside, but they still can't recognize many plant names!</p>
<p>Our classroom doesn't have doors, the forest is our research place, the river beach is our place for leisure activities, and those fields and mounds are where we read. Our books are a leaf, a beautiful flower. Those planted in the fields, swimming in the rivers, flying in the sky, growing on the ground, all of these are our living books; because they are living, they arouse a lot of learning interest in us. We call this kind of learning place the "Big Classroom"; except for the rare times when we read dull books in the classroom indoors, most of the time is spent in the Big Classroom.</p>
<p>The air in the Big Classroom is fresh, our bodies are comfortable, and our spirits are refreshed; the content of the books is rich, whatever we want to study, we have it; astronomy, geography, there are living things, and there is non-living things, we have everything; no wonder all the great scientists since ancient times have graduated from the "Big Classroom".</p>
<h3 id="e270">Sleeping Postures of Animals <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Hengjiu</p>
<p>Dear Little Friends! Previously, Mr. Fan told us about the sleeping postures of several animals in "The Sleep of Animals." This is indeed very meaningful. Here, I will just add a little bit of information.</p>
<p>Short-legged and fat beasts, such as elephants, rhinoceroses, hippos, etc., when they sleep, they first bend their legs and put them under their stomachs, and then lie down, stretching their four legs straight. Carnivorous beasts such as lions, tigers, and leopards sleep like cats. There is also a giraffe, also known as a unicorn, which always bends its head over and places it on its lower back when sleeping. When bears sleep, they always hide their heads in their bodies; however, there is a peculiar bear in America that is very lazy. When sleeping, it hangs its four feet upside down on tree branches, like a bat, grasping the branches with its claws. When we look at it, we feel that this sleeping method is very laborious, but in fact, its feet are very strong. The more soundly it sleeps, the tighter its feet grasp the branches. Little friends, do you think it's strange?</p>
<p>Also, domestic rabbits and squirrels simply don't look like they are sleeping when they sleep, they just shrink into a ball. Others, such as birds, chickens, and herons among the birds, always stand upright and still when sleeping, hiding their heads under their own wings.</p>
<p>Dear Little Friends! The above are all strange sleeping methods of animals, but there are many others! Due to space limitations, I can't write any more.</p>

<p>— Mr. Ma Peiyuan's Speech, Recorded by Zhang Rui</p>
<p>Today, I'm here to talk to you, children, about new life. First, we need to understand what we mean by "life." Life is the activity of human beings seeking survival. Whether it's agriculture, industry, commerce, academics, or politics... it's all life. So, what is called "new life"? New life is a meaningful life. And what is a meaningful life? Now, let me give you an example to illustrate: For instance, yesterday, Uncle Wang didn't go to work in the fields but instead went to the street to gamble, losing all but twenty-three yuan of his hundred-yuan money for selling the ox. He was upset and went to a tavern, ate three catties of sorghum, drank a bottle of old wine, and drunkenly ran home, fighting with his wife. The next morning, he woke up and felt he shouldn't have gambled yesterday. He shouldn't have drunk and certainly shouldn't have fought with his wife. Thinking this, he immediately went to the kitchen and apologized to his wife. His wife asked him, "Since you knew you were doing wrong yesterday, why did you do such a wrong thing?" Uncle Wang was speechless, and could only smile and walk away. Children! Do you think Uncle Wang's life has meaning? So I say, whatever you do, be able to first ask "Why?"—Why this way? Why not that way? Being able to answer this "why" is a meaningful life, which is what we call new life. The scope of new life is very broad, whether it's political, economic, social, or educational. So I hope you children will also live a meaningful new life in the future! As for what your new life as children should be like, please think about it carefully!</p>

<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan and concurrently the Chief Director of the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts, recently composed two songs, the Chinese Boy Scout Song and the Wildfire Song, to promote the spirit of Scouting. Now, I will transcribe them below:</p>
<p>Scout Song: Chinese Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! We, we, we are the young soldiers of the Three Principles of the People! Though our age is small, our ambition is great. We dedicate this body, dedicate this heart, dedicate this strength, for the people. Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace. Filling our actions with spirit, let us unite and move forward! Forward! Forward! The blue sky is high, the white sun shines brightly.</p>
<p>Wildfire Song: Burning wildfire, burning wildfire, wildfire shines brightly, wildfire shines brightly. The sky full of stars smiles at me, asking me, who does this fire shine upon? This fire comes from the vast desert of the Gobi; comes from the hundred-foot city of Lhasa; comes from the head of Qinghai; comes from the root of the Yellow River. Shine on my good brother: shine on my good younger brother: shine on my good older sister: shine on my good younger sister. Shine on my brothers and sisters' one heart; shine on my brothers and sisters' one heart; everyone sings joyfully, let the heart shine brightly; everyone rejoices, let the heart shine brightly!</p>

<p>Fluctuations Narrow, Transaction Volume Average</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw the future of silver remain uncertain, resulting in a rebound. The situation in the first half of the day was weak but resilient, and market sentiment was good. In the morning, overseas silver markets rose in both the UK and the US. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange also rose by 0.5 to 1.5%. Exchange rates trended upwards. London spot gold fell by half a penny. US cotton rose by 3 points, US wheat by 8.75. Stocks rose by $1.03. The opening price for wool was withdrawn to $62.30. According to an Associated Press report, the US President was still unlikely to agree to silver measures. Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, and others entered the market, pushing the price up to $6. Foreign dispatches also contained rumors of increased gold prices. Fuxing, Yongheng, and others sold, pushing the price back to $4.50. Later, a Reuters dispatch reported that the President and silver faction leaders began a meeting on Saturday evening. The White House stated that the President did not want any silver legislation to pass in the current Congress and that he believed he was in a good position to resist any mandatory silver legislation within the current Congress. The White House further stated that the President felt it would be impossible to address silver issues without cooperating with countries around the world. The situation then stabilized, and the price of silver fell slightly in the Seattle night market, causing the gold price to rise. Although there was a slight dip at one point in the morning, major players continued to enter the market, and the market continued to stabilize at the close. The trading range was limited in the first half of the day, and transactions were average. The price of red gold was $981. Swaps continued to be weak. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The market opened at $964.90, slightly down by 30 cents from the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price for British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 0625, and for US exchange at $34.625. Hengyuanyuan, Kangxiang, Yida, and Yong bought, pushing the price up to $6.50. HSBC listed British exchange at half a shilling and US exchange at 12.5 cents. Hengxing, Hengyu, Tianfeng, Zhifeng, Yongying, and Fengheng sold, pushing the price back to $5. Duyi bought September US dollars at 12.5 cents. Zhengjin took August at $35. Hengxing, Hengchang, and Yongjin were stable, but because Zhejiang plugged July US dollars at 8.75 cents, spot supply was available, struggling around $6. However, the domestic market was tight. Mitsui bought August US dollars at $35 and September at 12.5 cents. Zhifeng, Yongfu, Xingyong, Dasheng, Hengyu, Yida, Yongheng, Hengxing, and others entered the market, reaching $7. Goods were slightly weaker due to supply, but Hengxing and Yida Yong continued to enter the market due to the night market silver price falling by half a cent, pushing the price to $7.20. Yuqing Yong and Yida Yong sold, retreating, and Jiatai, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Qianchang, and Xiang also sold, dropping to $6. Hengxing entered again and recovered, then fell to $5.60. Fuchang and Qingfayong bought at low prices, and Dekang raised prices. The market gradually rose to $966.90 at noon. Goods were traded at $7.10. Fuchang continued to enter the market after the close, making it more stable. The highest price in the first half of the day was $967.20, and the lowest was $964.90, fluctuating by $2.30. As a result, the market rose by $1.70 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Settlement prices reflected HSBC's US exchange listing rising by 12.5 cents to $34.125, resulting in a standard gold price of $1014. Based on the closing price, approximately $47 was squeezed, down $5 from the previous close. The registered price for May was $975, and for June was $967. The morning water supplement was $975. The price of red gold was $981. The spot red gold market was average. The Tianjin group sold over 2,500 taels to Yingfenghang, Dadecheng, Tongfenghang, and Dafengheng at an additional $16.50. Over 4,000 taels of Eastern goods arrived, or were delivered at an additional price of $15.25 and $15. In addition, secondary goods with a purity of 985 were sold by Taikangrun to the customer group for over 400 taels at an additional $10.05. The swap market opened at around $5. Dadecheng and Yingfenghang immediately came in to make up the difference. The Dalian group successfully swapped out quite a bit, but all the spot traders were willing to swap out, gradually falling from $4.90. Later, Tongfenghuai also came in to make up the difference, falling to $4.60, which was successfully swapped by Shenkangfuyu to Tongfenghang, Dadecheng for $4.60. Finally, Shunli swapped it to Dadecheng for $4.70. Hengxing allocated 700 May strips to Yingfenghang at a price of $971. If large bulls cannot exit, the trend of swaps would be unimaginable. Transactions in the market were more active on the buying side. In total, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Hengtai, Tongchun, Hengyu, Yifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuanshengyong, Fufu Yidayong, Yuqingyong, Qingfayong, Xiangheyong, Deshenkang, Futai Xiang, and others were mainly on the buying side, while Shunli, Fuxingyong, Yongfengyuan, Maoyonghengchang, Yongtongfenghang, Yingfenghang, Yicheng Huixiang, and Qianchangxiang were mainly on the selling side. Fuxingyong and Zhifengyong first exited and then entered, while Shunmao Huiyuan and Dadecheng first entered and then exited. The Dalian group Shunli completed over 1,700 strips in total, netting out over 500 strips (mostly swaps). Wanxing completed around 1,100 strips in total, with minimal netting. The Guangdong group Hengxing entered over 400 strips and exited over 400. Shengsheng entered slightly under 100 and exited over 100. The total number of transactions for the day was 39,053 strips.</p>
<p>Among the May futures chips, bulls included Qianchangxiang with slightly under 4,300 strips, Yuanyi with over 1,290 strips, Qingfayong with over 1,100 strips, Shenkang and Yidayong with over 100 strips each, and the rest were scattered.

<h3 id="e275">Declining Financial Market Sentiment – Weekend Situation Particularly Quiet – <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Although overnight interest rates in the market increased by two points yesterday, totaling five points for both the morning and afternoon markets, market sentiment was undeniably declining. In ordinary years, with the tea and silk cocoon expenses during the third month of spring, coupled with the late April billing period, these two busy periods would coincide, leading to a time of extreme prosperity. Now, it has all turned into a bubble. Overnight rates were again at two points, slightly better than the interbank market in the past few days. However, with ample funds, it is ultimately difficult to expect a turnaround. For interbank bill transactions, transfers in the morning market totaled over 4.3 million, new transactions were over 100,000, transactions in the afternoon market were over 500,000, and transactions in the small clearinghouse totaled over 400,000. Bank clearings were significantly reduced compared to previous days, making the situation feel quite quiet. Chinese banks cleared over 2.4 million in bill funds, cleared over 3.8 million in various goods, exchange, tax advances, and miscellaneous funds, and released 400,000 from warehouses. Foreign banks cleared over 1.9 million in bill funds, cleared over 3.2 million in various goods, exchange, mortgage advances, and miscellaneous funds, cleared 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, and released 300,000 from warehouses. Japanese banks cleared over 1.2 million in bill funds, cleared over 3.2 million in various goods, exchange, mortgage advances, and miscellaneous funds, and entered 300,000 into warehouses. Native banks cleared over 39 million in foreign public notes, cleared over 4.2 million in foreign overnight funds, cleared 300,000 in various remittances, received 300,000 to 400,000 in cash, and made mortgage transactions worth over 300,000 and new transactions worth over 500,000. Over 1.6 million in banknotes were received and issued, with sources of 200,000 and outflows of 400,000. Furthermore, the total number of exchanges at the local clearinghouse was 5,313,931.81 silver dollars, including 2,392,512.60 silver dollars and 2,921,419.21 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained without any revival. The environment was unfavorable due to diplomatic setbacks, poor international atmosphere, and Japan's unreasonable and aggressive attitude, causing global unease. The situation in the Southwest also showed signs of dissatisfaction. The market atmosphere grew even gloomier, and investor sentiment weakened further. However, due to the approaching settlement period, both bulls and bears engaged in swaps, causing slight disruptions and rallies in market prices. Significant changes were still expected due to the looming settlement. The situation in the morning session was the worst, as various reports were unfavorable to the bulls. Prices began to fall immediately after opening, with the decline becoming more pronounced after a relatively stable start, dropping by half a dollar per year. Selling pressure was strong. The trend in the second session was more stable, with bulls engaging in swaps. Near-term continued to decline by about 20 cents, while far-term generally rose by about 10 cents. Consolidated salt tax gradually stabilized due to purchases by No. 4, etc., rising slightly by 10 to 20 cents. The market opened slightly short-squeezed in the afternoon, with this month's 20-mark rising by as much as 65 cents, and the rest also generally recovering slightly by 20 to 30 cents. The market was slightly better before closing, but weakened slightly afterwards. Overall, in recent times, due to the proximity of the settlement period, prices have occasionally deviated from the constraints of the environment, leading to irregular and unconventional increases and decreases. Therefore, the trend has often been distorted. This phenomenon is likely to persist for the next day or two. The final market results showed small bonds down by 5 to 30 cents, and downsizing and 96 bonds slightly better by 5 to 20 cents. The total transaction volume was 17,085,000 yuan. Spot transactions were not yet open. The comparison of highs, lows, increases, and decreases is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e278">New York Stock Market Recovers <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market yesterday fluctuated throughout the day. Towards the end, due to the weakness of the US dollar, the market recovered. Foreigners believed that gold prices would increase, so they sold off US dollars, but this claim is difficult to verify. The US dollar fell below the new parity against the French franc and the Dutch currency, and also fell significantly against other currencies. Gold mining stocks rose because it was generally believed that the Canadian government would reduce gold taxes. The small exchange rose, and speculative bonds still saw large-scale liquidations, but generally rose slightly. The rest were flat. Grain prices recovered due to the hope for silver legislation and production reports favorable to the bulls. According to the report from our agent: (Securities) The silver faction is very active in silver legislation, and the clamor for inflation is rising again, so the market is advancing strongly. (Wheat) Eastern buyers are entering the market, and shorts are covering. There is a high possibility of silver inflation, and buying is possible when prices fall due to the severe drought. (Cotton) The technical position is good, and the market's response is sensitive. First, due to a movement to have 10 million bales not picked and the encouragement from the silver faction that silver legislation is hopeful, the market recovered immediately after falling in the morning. The report also stated that President Thomas' proposal for reconciliation will not include any attachments. Spot trading is quiet and slightly loose. (Rubber) Fellow traders are buying, and the market is firm. There will be good demand soon. (Silver) Rumors are spreading that the government will raise gold prices, causing the US dollar to weaken. Silver speculators are awaiting the results of the President's meeting with the Senate on silver, so they are unwilling to trade. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.89 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Yarn and Cotton: Marked Yarn Showing Signs of Recovery <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>After several days of decline, the yarn market is gradually showing signs of a rebound. The rumors of factory shutdowns and reduced production are becoming increasingly tense. At the same time, there are 3,000 bales of old goods in the exchange. According to some, it is said that the shareholder group of the exchange has taken them in. As a result, the selling pressure has temporarily subsided, and more people are taking profits by short covering. Based on the above situation, it is possible that prices may recover by three or four yuan in the near future.</p>
<p>(Marked yarn rebounds by 70 to 80 cents) The marked yarn market opened flat in the morning session, but there was a lack of major sellers in the market. Prices for various months rose by 3, 4, and 6 cents. The market situation remained flat in the afternoon session, and prices for various months rose again by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,600 bales. Da Fu sold 1,150 bales, Rui Da sold 1,750 bales, Yuan Da sold 1,400 bales, Xincheng sold 1,050 bales, Da Liu sold 600 bales, Tongxing sold 550 bales, and Zhen Da sold 500 bales.

<p>The cotton market is declining daily due to weak foreign cotton prices and the sluggish yarn market. Rumors of shutdowns and reduced production are becoming increasingly serious, so the procurement of spot cotton is extremely sluggish. Investor sentiment is weakening, but bulls generally believe that inventory levels are not as high as in the yarn market, so they are not releasing their holdings.</p>
<p>(Zheng Marked Cotton Weakens) The marked cotton market opened in the morning with weak foreign cotton prices, falling by 50 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 61,500 bales.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market initially fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Later, it rebounded strongly due to purchases by Japanese merchants and strong demand for cotton yarn. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures prices rose by 2 to 5 points. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 6 points, and futures fell by 9 to 11 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by retail investors and Japanese merchants. It later recovered slightly due to purchases by European exporters. As a result, Pingar fell by 7.5 annas, Oomra fell by 1 rupee, and Broach fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 20th).</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, prices for each month initially showed stability. With the quotation of foreign wheat in Chicago slightly better by around 0.2 yuan and in Canada significantly better by around 0.08 yuan, the market sentiment after opening was slightly stable. Opening prices for each month were slightly better by 0.005 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the buying interest from both inside and outside the industry was truly impossible to stimulate. As far as merchant groups were concerned, only spot transactions were of interest; the focus on forward transactions was not as strong as before because general commodity prices were still generally declining. Therefore, prices fell again in subsequent trading sessions. By the afternoon opening, prices for each month stepped into decline again, and new record low prices for each month gradually emerged. The current month initially opened at 0.02 yuan, but later decreased to 2.0005 yuan, showing a trend of approaching the 2 yuan level. May also broke through to below 2 yuan. All other months saw a consistent and sharp decline. This situation is actually due to weak purchasing power, and those within and outside the industry do not dare to harbor thoughts of speculation, so the situation is getting worse and worse, making it even more unthinkable. As a result, prices fell again by 0.02 yuan, May fell by 0.0225 yuan, June fell by 0.015 yuan, July fell by 0.0175 yuan, August fell by 0.02 yuan, and September fell by 0.0075 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, prices for each month generally showed stability. With the quotation of foreign wheat recovering by around 0.2 or 0.08 yuan, the market sentiment at the time of opening turned slightly stable, and the selling pressure from within the industry also paused slightly. Prices for each month were similar to the previous fluctuations. By the afternoon opening, the situation quickly and gradually deteriorated. Initially due to the clear weather, and later due to the falling prices of futures flour, the market became nervous, and prices loosened again. The fundamental reason is that after the devastation of the rural areas, there are very few opportunities for commodity prices to rise. The current month, due to the poor flour market and the abundant arrival of spot wheat, saw a significant drop in opening prices. The far-term, with June being the weakest, fell as low as 3.30 yuan. As a result, the current month fell by 0.06 yuan, June fell by 0.03 yuan, and August fell by 0.01 yuan. Spot wheat, due to the significant decline in standards and the closure of mills, saw no trading.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Late Indica Rice Floods the Market, Prices Fall by 0.08 Yuan <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources of goods from various merchant groups suddenly surged, with 60 vessels (estimated at around 9,000 piculs of goods). Among them, late indica rice still accounted for a large proportion, as much as two-thirds, about 40 vessels. Thick japonica and various other varieties were still not plentiful. Due to the sudden surge in sources, merchant groups’ interest in holding goods turned lax, and a fatigued sentiment immediately emerged. Sellers had no choice but to reluctantly lower prices. Merchant groups from Nanyang, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other places successively purchased Zhongguan goods at relatively low prices. Merchant groups from Beiyang, Tianjin, Yantai, and other places also began to purchase goods, with the two Beiyang merchant groups purchasing over 2,000 packages of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other high-quality, ordinary, and Zhongguan goods. However, in the end, due to the abundant arrival of goods, the market saw an oversupply, with a large surplus remaining, and prices fell by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan. Thick japonica rice from Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, and other merchant groups also weakened by 0.05 yuan due to less favorable shop stocks and the decline in the late indica rice market. Duyang pointed rice and Yinyuan rice, due to the scarcity of goods, uniquely stood firm. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, 27 or 28 vessels from various merchant groups arrived from Hebei. Sales of all goods on the market were sluggish, with only Baiyuan and Yangjian being relatively active. The market price for high-quality japonica rice remained stable, with medium-quality rice priced near a discount. The prices of Yangjian, Dujian, Bujian, and Kejian rice showed a slight weakening trend. Early indica rice was out of stock and without a market. Thin indica rice prices were weak by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. The prices of Baiyuan and Yinyuan remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Ke Yuan Rice Suddenly Rises by 0.2 Yuan - Guangdong Merchant Group Trials Coarse Ke Xian Rice - <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw booming arrivals and sales, and the market was quite lively. However, the Wen-Tai merchant group's interest turned weak yesterday, and the whole city only purchased 600 packages of Wuji Xian rice and 100 packages of Xiangji Yuan rice. There was no interest in anything else. However, the Fuzhou purchasing interest was more active, and this street also followed suit to socialize. Quanzhou also inquired about 250 packages of Ji Hong rice. Furthermore, a Guangzhou merchant group arrived in the city to trial 1,000 packages of Shashi coarse Xian rice. Guangzhou had not purchased rice for a long time. Yesterday, they suddenly purchased 1,000 packages, and market sentiment was upward. The total market issued 6,845 packages. Apart from the above-mentioned merchant groups, this street purchased more than 1,000 packages in total, and the rest were all purchased by Fuzhou. Although recent arrivals have been strong, especially Shashi rice, the market, and sentiment are upward with consistent inquiries from Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and this street. High-quality and medium-quality varieties all rose by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. However, Keji Yuan rice has had fewer arrivals and stocks recently, and there have also been few arrivals and stocks from Hebei, which has drawn the attention of this street and the Beiyang and Nanyang merchant groups. Yesterday, more than 200 packages of Hunan Keji Yuan rice were sold, and the price suddenly rose by more than 0.2 yuan.</p>

<p>(Delayed Development of Silkworm Eggs in Zhejiang) "Gaoshi" ordered farmers this year to breed improved varieties. During the hatching period, the weather was unusually cold, and the silkworms hatched unevenly. The early batches had already completed two molts and were feeding on leaves for three or four days. The late batches were only just beginning to feed on leaves after the first molt. "Sanbao": The number of farmers raising silkworms this year is less than two-thirds of last year. The number of eggs hatched is also small. In addition, the silkworms hatched at different times, with a difference of about a week. The early silkworms will have completed two molts and have sufficient leaves. The late silkworms are only feeding on leaves for three or four days. Guidance officers are assisting with tasks such as stimulating hatching and disinfection. There have been no changes in sericulture yet. "Jinjiaqiao": Farmers in various villages have abandoned local silkworm eggs and are not raising them. There have been no changes in sericulture yet. Only because of the cold weather, the development of silkworms is delayed, and the early batches are only in the second molt and have plenty of leaves. "Wuxi": Less than one-third of the families in the four townships are raising silkworms. This is because of the repeated failures in sericulture over the years, which have suffered losses. Therefore, very few people are buying silkworm eggs. Various silkworm egg farms are reducing prices to seek sales. High-quality improved varieties such as Shouxing brand are only selling for one yuan per sheet. Lao Ci brand is nine cents, and Sanyuan Jinqian and other brands are only eight to seven cents. The livelihood of various silkworm egg sales shops remains bleak.</p>
<p>(Yokohama Raw Silk Plunges Repeatedly) Japan is now starting to raise spring silkworms, and new cocoons will soon be on the market. However, the stock of old silk is still large, so they are actively lowering prices to seek sales. The market price of Yokohama raw silk has plunged repeatedly. Ordinary Eight Arrow brand 13/15 denier is only opening at 540 yen, which is less than 480 yuan when converted to Chinese currency. Haibei brand 20/22 denier is only 505 yen, which is only 438 yuan when converted to Chinese currency. European and American silk merchants are still not making large purchases.</p>

<p>Qimen black tea has always been known for its excellent quality. However, because it was picked too late, there was less fine tea and more coarse tea, which often led to unfavorable business. This year, the tea houses in Qi floating and other areas, in view of this, urged each tea household to pick tea earlier in advance. According to the letter report from Qizhuang, Shanli Likou and other places have already started picking and producing this week. Because the weather is clear, the tea buds are extremely fine and tender, and the fragrance is particularly excellent. Tea houses and manor houses are collecting green tea at 1.5 yuan per catty. In the future, the price for dried mature tea will be about 280 yuan per dan.</p>

<h3 id="e288">The Evolution of Gender Relations <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Biologists tell us that life on Earth initially had no gender. It reproduced through cell division. Later, cells gradually had differences in size and activity, and there was what is called the difference between male and female. The combination of these two types of cells is called sexual reproduction. Female cells—ova—are often two to three thousand times larger than male cells—sperm. This is also evident in lower-level organisms, where females—such as female fleas and queen bees—are often larger than males. Moreover, female cells have the right to choose or reject male cells. Therefore, for males to please females, it is necessary to transform their bodies. For example, the males of higher animals are often more beautiful and magnificent than the females. This is the general evolution of gender relations in the animal kingdom. As for humans, after breaking away from the realm of apes and becoming the spirit of all things, gender relations are naturally different from all animals. Here is a historical account of the evolution of human gender relations:</p>
<p>(1) Primitive Age—Mother-Centered Age. After humans broke away from the animal realm of free sex, sexual intercourse was restricted—incest was forbidden. Thus, parents and children were distinguished, and society was born. However, at that time, floods and fierce battles were a major threat to humans. Therefore, men had to spend their days conquering abroad or wandering in other countries, with uncertain whereabouts and impermanent lives. For the sake of reproducing the race, women cultivated nearby and raised children, living a relatively stable life. Because of polyandry, children only knew their mothers. Women dominated everything, and maternal power was higher than everything else.</p>
<p>(2) Feudal Age—Father-Centered Age. Human power triumphed over nature. Men abandoned nomadic life for farming, and life gradually became stable. Land gradually became private property. Women specialized in production, raising children, or only assisting in cultivation and other domestic handicrafts. From this, economic power was entirely in the hands of men. Maternal power declined from this point on. Children took their father's surname, and paternal power replaced maternal power. Men dominated everything. Women thus became subordinates of men, becoming privately owned by men in the same way as livestock and land. From this, a male-centered feudal society was formed, creating all kinds of dogmas that imprisoned women. From this point on, women not only had no rights but also lost the status of "human." (3) Capitalist Age—Women's Dual Slavery Age. Since the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 18th century, machines have replaced human power, disrupting domestic handicrafts. On the one hand, men who were tenant farmers and laborers could not support themselves, let alone take care of their families. Therefore, women also left their homes to work as laborers and servants, at the mercy of others, exploited. From this, ordinary poor women, under the subjugation of men, became slaves of factories or masters—dual slaves! Or they became prostitutes.</p>
<p>(4) Gender Equality Age. The wheel of time is moving forward, and society is changing day by day. When things reach an extreme, they must revert. Women, living in this inhuman environment, must rise up to seek improvement. At the same time, some men will provide sympathetic assistance. At that time, men and women will be members of production, and no one will be enslaved by anyone else. Everyone has the freedom to choose a profession, and everyone has the freedom to love. Everyone has their own profession, and everyone has their own freedom. There are no resentful women, nor are there kept men. This is not a utopia; some countries are already practicing it.</p>
<p>Ancient China did not seem to lightly regard women. The myth of Nuwa patching up the sky with stones is proof that women have great abilities. Also, the theory of mother-centeredness is valid. However, since Confucian thought dominated people's minds, the idea of male superiority and female inferiority was more harmful than in any other country. The "Book of Changes" states, "The way of heaven creates the male, the way of earth creates the female. Heaven is superior, earth is inferior." It has long regarded women as doormats for men. The "Book of Songs" says, "If a son is born, he is laid on a bed, he plays with a scepter. If a daughter is born, she is laid on the ground, she plays with a tile." Women have been despised since childhood. There are also the long chains and short fetters of the three obediences and four virtues, which heavily lock women up. Fortunately, heaven and earth cannot lack women, or else Chinese women would have been completely assimilated by these teachings and returned to heaven long ago. For thousands of years, Wu Zetian managed to hold on, but she only did it for herself and did not awaken all women. She ultimately failed and did not help later women. In the past 30 years, the surge of the women's movement in Europe and the United States has also affected this ancient country in the Far East, and there has been a considerable response. However, most women are still living in a drunken stupor or like beasts of burden. The entire country of China is also under the heavy pressure of imperialism, and Chinese women are suffering from even heavier oppression. But I believe that when things reach an extreme, they must revert. People under heavy pressure, rise up! We do not hope that women will overwhelm all men and rebuild a mother-centered society. What we hope for is a truly equal society for men and women.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Talking About Tiles <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>The Book of Songs says: If a boy is born, give him a scepter (zhang) to play with; if a girl is born, give her a tile to play with. During the Song Dynasty, brothels were called tile houses (washe) or tile places (wazi). It seems that the character tile (wa) is often used for women. Sometimes, congratulating someone on the birth of a daughter is called "joy of playing with a tile," which completely represents women with tiles.</p>
<p>The difference between a seven-foot-tall man and a woman is like the difference between jade and tile. In ancient times, many heroes, in times of crisis and survival, often said a hard word: "Better to be jade shattered than a tile preserved." If you extend this from the perspective of playing with a scepter and playing with a tile, it means: Better to be a dead husband than a living woman.</p>
<p>In recent years, the country's situation has been precarious, collapsing and splitting apart, which is the time for men to shatter like jade. However, silently, few are heard of. Is it that there are very few husbands in society, and most of those alive are women?</p>
<p>This may be the real situation. No matter how much the country lacks statistics, it is known that there should be more women than men. Look, in addition to the flourishing of polygamy, brothels everywhere are increasing day by day. Moreover, the so-called wars against immortals and against foreigners, I am afraid that the work of cleaning up bandits requires the lives of men in most cases. If China were to organize a "husband-seeking corps" like Japan, it would be a magnificent sight. As for young widows, their husbands have already entered the earth, so they are not qualified to join this ranks. However, all these women who have lost their partners have not been deeply influenced by propriety, justice, and shame. They neither maintain chastity nor seek their late husbands. They flock to the "Peach Blossom River" and the "Beauty's Nest." The revolution has not yet succeeded, and women are not making any effort. This is a great sigh!</p>
<p>For these shameless women, those in high positions generally forgive them for being ignorant women; and those in humble positions mostly pity them for being at the end of their ropes. However, there are also some people who believe that this is women's revenge against men and the beginning of the women's movement. They think that men are the enemies of women, and any cruel means should be used against enemies. The best would be knives, saws, cauldrons, and tripods to deal with them. Unfortunately, these things are not available, so they have to use deception, manipulation, abandonment, betrayal, and other methods. Even if there is no problem with life, they should transform themselves into the Beauty's Nest. How wrong this view is, needs no discussion. Is the goal of these people to drive all men into the abyss and establish a so-called "country of women"? Fortunately, those who hold this view are only a very small number of ignorant women, and the Chinese nation will not be affected by it and be in danger.</p>
<p>However, what is frightening is that errors close to this kind are actually spreading in everyday social phenomena. Generally, it is to see the enemy who conflicts with oneself as heavy as Mount Tai and to see the entire big problem as light as a feather. Gather all one's heart and energy, and work every day to thoroughly treat what one calls an enemy. Deception and cruelty, no matter what method; men's lives are short, and their vitality is lost.</p>
<p>To exhaust this number is to see the number of "tile houses" increasing day by day, the signs of "disintegration" becoming clearer day by day, the wind of "tile houses" becoming more intense day by day, and the flow of "tile preservation" becoming more numerous day by day; it will be seen that everything is made of tile, and the whole country will become a pile of "rubble." This can be considered the victory of tiles!</p>
<h3 id="e290">Several First Aid Methods <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Youbai</p>
<p>People in the world are in danger of life at all times, so it is necessary for everyone to know important and convenient first aid methods. Now briefly describe as left: (1) Trauma, those who are injured or drowned by violent injuries often show a state of collapse, that is, weak pulse, pale face, heart failure, difficulty breathing, etc. At this time, the injured should be immediately laid flat on their back, making their whole body comfortable, and the head slightly lower. If they are still conscious, they can drink a small amount of ammonia wine. If they have lost consciousness, use cotton wool dipped in a small amount of ammonia and place it in front of their nose. The injured can restore consciousness by smelling it. The most important thing to pay attention to is that when consciousness disappears, it is most taboo to get cold. The injured must sleep in a warm place and put a hot water bag next to their side or feet, but it should not be too hot to avoid burns.</p>
<p>(2) If the wound is bleeding, use clean gauze or cloth strips to press down on the wound. If it still does not stop, use a rubber tourniquet with elasticity to tie it up. However, this method can only be used by those with experience. Otherwise, improper use can be harmful.</p>
<p>(3) If the skin is broken, do not touch it with your hands. Immediately use disinfected cotton wool dipped in iodine and other bactericidal drugs to apply to the wound, and then wrap it with clean gauze strips. If the injury is more serious, send it to the hospital.</p>
<p>(4) The most common first aid method for nosebleeds is to raise your head or sit up, breathe through your mouth, and cover the upper part of your nose with a cold water towel or ice pack. If it still does not stop, you should ask a doctor for help.</p>
<p>In short, first aid methods are all emergency temporary response methods. All serious injuries and illnesses are often transformed from small ones. There are many, many cases where dangerous symptoms are caused by unclean fingers or bandages, so it is best to go to the doctor for treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e291">A Woman's Heart <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— First</p>
<p>People always say this: "You are too good." But, I want to receive judgments of "right" and "wrong." However, there is no absolute "right" and "wrong" judgment in the world; who is willing to tell me: "You are right" or "You are wrong?" Why "too good"? I understand: this is just a sigh of sympathy from the weak, if this one is my friend; otherwise, it is mocking me as a foolish idiot.</p>
<p>When my father knew of my unfortunate experiences, he said to me as if he were angry: "What did you do; you are really useless. You can't even hold onto your own husband!" Alas. Even my father doesn't understand my "heart"!</p>
<p>Not long after we fell in love, I learned that he had been passionately in love with another woman not long before we fell in love; but I don't know how he and she broke up. -- It is said that it broke up because she refused to agree to his demands.</p>
<p>After I told my best friend about all the things between him and me, she became worried for me: she thought that a man who had just come out of a passionate relationship would immediately be passionately in love with a second woman and forget the first woman so quickly, this man's feelings are too changeable, too easily transferred. She warned me: "Can you believe that he won't fall passionately in love with a third woman?" So I began to doubt, hesitate, I wanted to leave him. But he was so stubborn: he wrote an "insulting" article scolding my friends as despicable, scolding them for not destroying our love. Naturally, my friends left me in anger.</p>
<p>He earnestly dissected himself to me -- using various methods to express the sincerity of his heart. Finally, he concluded; he smashed the precious pipa that his teacher had given him; and told me: -- he also raised his hand to show me, a half-inch-long scar at the pulse on his wrist, covered with adhesive plaster -- he wanted to commit suicide, he had written a "blood letter" to me.</p>
<p>I looked at the broken pipa and the scar on his hand, I was very moved, very sad; I abandoned doubt, stopped hesitating, and became a prisoner of emotion, he wouldn't (or couldn't bear to let me)</p>
<p>see the "blood letter" he "said" he wrote, and I deeply believed that he had indeed done this tragic and foolish thing, and I was grateful for his sincere love for me; I never thought that he was using "death" to threaten an emotionally weak woman.</p>
<p>He finally gained victory: he "occupied" the second woman. We lived together for five years and had three children. Under the pressure of borrowing money, pawning things, and even living in hunger, we lived a life of conflicts of "sexual" disharmony and "temperament" disharmony: we often quarreled, and sometimes he even beat me; but we also often said, thinking; that we loved each other.</p>
<p>After five years, our life slowly improved economically; but our love, unknowingly, showed obvious cracks, although he still said that he loved me, and I believed that I loved him -- he had also told me that he loved my friend, my friend strictly rejected him, and later she got married, and this matter subsided for a long time. Not long before we separated, he had mentioned to me: he loved ××; but he immediately confessed to me and said: he shouldn't love other people. I also saw the strangeness in his treatment of me and the cracks between us, but I thought I shouldn't easily doubt him; I should trust him and understand him. Besides, he is a faithful man, who made an oath with "broken pipa", "suicidal wrist", and "written blood letter", would his "conscience" allow him to break his oath? -- However, I also thought: if our combination was a mistake from the beginning, and now he has discovered the disharmony between us, and at the same time he has found love elsewhere, he is willing to propose a divorce, I will definitely accept it; because I myself have long felt uneasy after living with him - not a simple problem of material lack -- but I still hope that we can all be patient, maybe for the sake of the children we will slowly live in peace.</p>
<p>I never expected that he would use deception to leave me and frame me, was he afraid that I would also use "death" to blackmail him? In the second month after I gave birth to my third child, he said to me: he had already planned it, he decided to go to Japan. I had heard him say many times: he said he had not read enough books, which was a lifelong regret. He wanted to find a way to go to Japan. Therefore, I believed and was very happy that he could fulfill his wish. In order to encourage his ambition, not wanting to burden him with family, I took three children, and according to his wishes, returned to my hometown -- Hunan. I thought: my task for him should be to help him in this way. Why didn't I doubt him? Guard against him? Because I thought "love" should "trust". Even if he set up a plan to leave me, what is the point of me not leaving him? If he sincerely loved me, this is a perfect touchstone. However, I still deeply believed: he will return from Japan in two years, as he said! He has a higher "position" in society, more "money"; we will have a very good life coming.</p>
<p>But not long after we left, he and another woman lived together in Shanghai; but I didn't know. He wrote to me still saying that he missed us very much; after a year and a half, I heard about their cohabitation from his new lover's family. When I wrote to him asking why he didn't openly tell me and discuss the issue of the three children, his reply was a frank admission; but he still said it in a repentant and extremely moving tone -- he said that he and she had a long history, and they had children, and he had fallen into a love net and could not escape. He said he still loved me and wanted to remarry me. He said he loved children too much, he liked having many children, and he still wanted to have children with me.</p>
<p>I got the story of him and her falling in love from her family, knowing that he again used the same old trick to occupy the third woman. -- Her father said to me? He said to her: if she didn't agree to his demands, he would "die". Therefore, she was finally occupied by him. He won again.</p>
<p>I have been separated from him for five years. In five years, our distance is as far as the north and south poles - he went to Fujian, I lived in Hunan for two years and then struggled to go to Beiping to make a living. In five years, I suffered all kinds of cruel abuse from society, struggling to support three children, he didn't help me. He wanted me to send the children to his hometown -- Zhejiang, to be taken care of by his seventy-year-old and sixty-year-old and sick parents. I couldn't bear to let three such young children suffer with two old people, I didn't do that. Last year, he returned from Fujian to Shanghai, and I went from Beiping to Nanjing, he wanted me to give him the children. I only gave him one. This year, he went to Shaanxi again, I heard from her that she was unwilling to bring my children. And the fact proved to me, his letter also proved: he doesn't need many children anymore - he and she have two more children - he doesn't love the children I gave birth to anymore.</p>
<p>He is a poor scholar wandering everywhere, and I am a weak and weaker woman, how will I deal with him?</p>
<p>For the sake of the three poor, unfortunate young ones, I think I should sacrifice everything of myself to take on this responsibility; although my own ability is so weak, and the future is so bleak! I cannot care about my own suffering, I do not hope for his help; I only ask for true sympathy in the world, and the final judgment of justice.</p>
<p>Why couldn't I initially reject his blackmail? After living together and feeling the conflicts in life, why couldn't I leave him? Why did I resolutely take the children home, deeply believing in him without doubting him? Why didn't I give the children to his parents? Why can't I abandon the children, and still take on such a difficult and arduous responsibility for him?</p>
<p>"You are 'too' good"! This is the only judgment I got from the world. People say: "The heart of a vicious woman", I hate why my heart is not "vicious"? Why not "poisonous"? I am actually a "weakling"!</p>
<p>Is there anyone willing to tell me: "You are right" or "You are wrong"?</p>

<p>— Lian Sheng</p>
<p>Marriage -- what a thought-provoking term!</p>
<p>Some people say "marriage is the graveyard of love", really, marriage is too painful and too boring for me. How much I curse the life of marriage! It can bury people's youth, it makes people lose their diligence, it gives people infinite sadness, negativity. At least, that's for me.</p>
<p>From friendship to love, from love to marriage with him, it took a full four and a half years, we understood each other's tendencies, understood each other's temperaments, knew that a combination was possible, and then we got married.</p>
<p>On the day of the ceremony, many friends praised our happy marriage. Many classmates showed envious eyes. Indeed, we matched so well, whether in academics, skills, or qualifications.</p>
<p>Let's look at the life after marriage, we loved each other so deeply that we couldn't bear to be apart. Unfortunately, he lost his job and sighed at home every day. I tried my best to comfort him, to make him happy, to ease his mind. At the same time, I dismissed the nanny and replaced her with my own operations.</p>
<p>As for him, he lost his mother at the age of thirteen, in order to make him relive the sweet love of a loving mother, I also represented his mother's love for him, he often said: since marriage, he has almost forgotten his mother, and no longer feels the pain of losing his mother. Sometimes, he seemed very annoyed and scolded me, I deeply understood his irritable temper and just didn't talk back, although, bitter tears flowed back into my stomach. (To be continued)</p>

Moreover, the journal is entirely run by women, and the long-term contributors such as: Huang Luyin, He Fanning, Yi Fan, Huang Yiyu, Mei Meizhen, Jin Shiyin, He Mei, Chen Biyun, Su Yang, Fan Ying, Bi Yao, Guo Zhenyi, Feng Xi, Li Wencan, Chen Weijiang, and Cha Ou are all female writers with insightful views and thorough thoughts.

<p>Three. Wollstonecraft</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft (Mary Wollstonecraft) is also one of the great figures among the advanced warriors in the struggle for women's rights. She was British, born in 1759, the same era as Condorcet (see last issue of this journal). Condorcet was a genius propagandist and organizer of the women's movement in the era of the French Revolution; while Wollstonecraft was a writer who fought for women's rights with her pen. In her famous book "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman", her sharp writing style and passionate wording gave great excitement to the British women who had already awakened to freedom at that time.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft was extremely poor in her childhood, and she helped her mother with housework, abandoning the happiness of childhood. But because of this, she developed a kind of ability, that is, in her youth, she tried her best to seek independent employment. She gradually moved from being a teacher in a small school, a trainer, a principal, to entering the field of writing - mainly pedagogy.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a political figure in England named Burke, who published a pamphlet slandering the French Revolution, and Wollstonecraft wrote "A Vindication of the Rights of Men" to refute it. It can be said that she fervently believed in the creed of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft was not only sensitive to political oppression, but also sensitive to the plight of the poor. In "A Vindication of the Rights of Men" and other works, she angrily attacked the king, calling him "a soulless puppet standing high in the court:" She attacked the declining aristocracy, attacked parasitic companions, and condemned the slave spirit of the standing army. She believes that the root of social evil lies in the division of society into classes. She said, "Poverty is the mother of crime and prostitution." "A Vindication of the Rights of Men" made Wollstonecraft's fame greatly increased, which aroused the reactionary forces' hatred for her. The brave Wollstonecraft was very firm; she tirelessly solidified the concept of social and political equality that she had realized in her heart. As a result of her hard work in research and thinking, she published "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" in 1792. Her insights are higher and deeper than Condorcet's. She believes that allowing women to enjoy completely equal rights is not only the realization of an abstract concept of justice, but also a prerequisite for the highest development of personality and the full prosperity of women. She said that only political and economic liberation can enable women to freely and thoroughly solve the unique tasks of themselves.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft said that women should not only receive equal education, unite with the highest aspirations of men, but also gain economic independence and get rid of dependence on men. Women's prostitution or marriage due to the oppression of poverty are not allowed.</p>
<p>She said that women who have lost their political rights and do not pay attention to the interests of the entire society will inevitably not be independent, and will become victims of superstition, and will definitely not wisely educate their children. The intelligence of women should be more than what it is now, otherwise, women cannot become virtuous mothers. "Women should be transformed from slaves in politics and civil rights into wise and free citizens. Try to let women enjoy all the happiness of education and manage the country like men, and then you will clearly see how smart and excellent women will be with their own liberation."</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft called the selfish love of motherhood, which is closed in a narrow family and isolated from the world, "animalistic love." She said that to train citizens, we must first have good female citizens. To make people's rights full, women need to elect their own representatives to participate in political institutions - the parliament, and not to ask about politics, "obey others' arbitrary decisions." But if the entire administrative system of the country is suitable for an autocratic regime, then women should not lament.</p>
<p>The main idea of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" is as described above.</p>
<p>In the conclusion of this book, she also established a great task for the women's world, that is to develop their buried talents and recognize their own strength. However, she said, if there is no equality in society, no elimination of the differences in the valve, and no liberation of women, then women will not be able to become excellent.</p>

<h3 id="e296">An Exploration of the Shanghai Municipal Election System <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai municipal elections, reporters have repeatedly written articles for discussion, and the thirteenth representative congress of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association was held on the 16th. The Chinese members of the board of directors of the current Public Works Bureau have been elected. Although we have seen a rough picture of this election situation in the newspapers, there must be many people who do not understand the truth about whether this election system is appropriate. Therefore, I will give a brief description of the municipal election system and the Shanghai Municipal Election Regulations for discussion with the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Democratic politics is a better system in politics, which has been generally recognized by political scientists. The representative system is a way to realize democratic politics, and the representative system depends on the election system to express it, so all countries that adopt a democratic system attach importance to the election method. In the beginning, all advanced countries had various restrictions on elections, such as property, age, education, taxation, gender, etc. Later, they gradually evolved, and to this day, except for slight restrictions on age and education, they have all implemented universal suffrage. The so-called universal suffrage system means that all citizens who are nationals, are over 21 years old, have lived for a few months (different in each country), and are literate, can participate in the election, without any restrictions on property, taxation, gender, etc. Therefore, the qualifications of voters can be said to have been reduced to the lowest level, because without this, it is not enough to fully express the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>The election methods are divided into direct and indirect. Direct elections use citizens to directly elect the people they want to elect, while indirect elections are where voters elect representatives, and then the representatives represent the election. Direct elections are mostly suitable for municipal areas with smaller areas and fewer populations, while indirect elections are the opposite. In the election, there are also so-called nominated candidates, that is, each election first nominates a number of candidates for citizens to choose and vote. This method can be applied to both direct and indirect elections, but the methods are slightly different in each country. The advantage of this is that it makes it easier for voters to follow, so that they do not vote blindly without any standards.</p>
<p>Municipal elections are sometimes divided into districts, and sometimes not. Voting mostly uses anonymous secret ballots. If a nomination system is used, the ballots are issued by the government for voters to fill in and cast into the ballot box, or they can be sent by the post office. In short, modern elections can be said to have become increasingly universal, fair, and convenient. In the beginning, we Chinese had no right to vote in the Shanghai Special Zone (i.e., the Public Concession) election. The board of directors of the Public Works Bureau only had foreigners, because Westerners generally had a misconception that the concession belonged to the foreigners, and only foreigners had the right to interfere in municipal affairs. But according to legal principles, this view is wrong. It was not until the 17th year of the Republic of China that the initiative of having Chinese directors was created, increasing from three to five. This process has been discussed in this journal and does not need to be repeated. Now, I will only discuss the election method of Chinese directors.</p>
<p>Only a part of Shanghai Chinese have the right to elect directors. There are strict restrictions on both voters and candidates. The qualifications of voters must have one of the following three: (1) Those who hold real estate worth more than 500 taels: (2) Those who pay more than 10 taels of property tax per year; (3) Those who pay more than 500 taels of rent per year and pay taxes. (The above-mentioned real estate must be in the Public Concession) The qualifications of candidates are (1) those who pay more than 50 taels of property tax per year, (2) those who pay more than 1,200 taels of rent per year and pay taxes. In addition to these two restrictions, candidates must have lived in the concession for more than five years. As for the election steps, the indirect system is adopted. First, those with the right to vote organize the Chinese Taxpayers Association to elect representatives, and then the representatives of the Taxpayers Association elect the directors. From this point of view, the election qualifications in the Shanghai Special Zone are completely focused on taxation and assets. People with a little common sense of modern politics cannot but feel regretful about this election system. "... If universal suffrage is implemented, not only we, but also foreigners, will dream of it." (See the speech of Mr. Wang Xiaolai at the Taxpayers' Association on the 16th) This kind of psychology is indeed a fact. However, this issue cannot be discussed at the moment, because the election of directors by our taxpayers is still restricted by the foreigners, and cannot be the same as the Western taxpayers' equal election, let alone others? Therefore, the next step should be to actively awaken the masses, train the masses, and constantly strive for progress based on the current situation. What is more, according to the facts, to take a step back, since the election is based on taxation, then in theory, taxpayers should have equal rights, and there should be no discrimination due to different nationalities; Chinese and Western citizens should jointly elect representatives. Of course, in fact, ethnic boundaries are inevitable, and moreover, the municipal administration of the concession is in the hands of foreigners, and elections in different nationalities are difficult to handle, but the Chinese taxpayers in the concession should have the right to vote, and no Westerners with any prejudice can deny it now. In this way, even if the Chinese and foreigners are separated to elect representatives, and each elects their own representatives, the number of directors should also be allocated according to the total amount of taxes paid by the Chinese and Westerners. The total amount of taxes paid by the Chinese accounts for more than 55% of the total revenue of the Public Works Bureau, so the number of representatives should be at least more than half. But what is it now? There are nine Western directors of the Public Works Bureau, but only five Chinese directors! European and American countries are advanced countries that have implemented democratic politics, but the Shanghai municipal administration controlled by Westerners has such an unreasonable election system, and there is such unequal treatment in the number of elected representatives from China and foreign countries. The reporter is not only worried about the implementation of the democratic system, but also about the future of international cooperation, which is fraught with unpredictable crises and should not be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e297">Rural Elementary School Teacher's Chalk Life <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>The autumn wind blows, and the weather is delightfully refreshing. In the light green river, the water flows slowly and pleasantly. At this moment, two classmates and I were on a boat heading towards ×× village. We had just graduated from middle school, and we were about to go to ×× village to teach. Having not yet experienced the darkness of the world, we held beautiful fantasies about this future profession. We were eager to transform the current education system, to integrate the school and the countryside. We harbored boundless enthusiasm in our hearts, like a burning stove.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the 'chalk life' is not a happy one. You have to wake up early every day to lead the students in morning exercises; you have to rack your brains every day, spending energy and effort to lecture for seven or eight hours; and at night, you have to correct a lot of messy exercise books. And when Kid A punches Kid B, and Kid B comes crying to tell you, you have to lose your temper and hit Kid A a few times: Kid A's mother will then come and ask you why you hit her son... In short, when you are an elementary school teacher, you will be busy from morning till night. However, my two classmates and I didn't care about these things; we endured it all. And so, we continued to work.</p>
<p>We started by integrating with the students. After class, we played with the students.</p>
<p>'Come on, let's capture Mr. ×!' The innocent and lively children surrounded me and carried me to their prison.</p>
<p>In this way, we had a very good relationship with the students. Of course, we were very strict in class. We treated the students with both 'kindness and authority,' guiding them with emotional education, turning the entire school into a paradise, to the point that the children even came to school on Sundays.</p>
<p>Next, we broke the local feudal remnants of traditional concepts of men and women, eliminating the gender boundaries between students. Eventually, teachers, students, boys, and girls were all playing basketball together.</p>
<p>We helped the senior and intermediate grades produce wall newspapers, and we also published a picture wall newspaper for the lower grades. Whenever we saw countless small heads crowding in front of the wall newspaper, with pure eyes and simple rural smiles on their faces, we were so moved that we didn't know what to do, and we were so happy that we couldn't even smile.</p>
<p>Being with these pure children is unparalleled happiness. I went with them to 'general cleaning,' worked together, planted vegetable gardens together, traveled together...</p>
<p>When the setting sun was as red as fire, we often carried hoes and went to the vegetable garden with the children. Passing through fields and quiet woods, the birds sang</p>

<h3 id="e298">The Relative Ideological World and the New Life Movement <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Min</p>
<p>In the current ideological world, its changes are truly endless, but the most obvious are 'modernization' and 'restoration of antiquity.' Novel and eccentric things are staged there every day, but they always escape these two paths, these two paths that develop in opposition to each other. The reason why the Chinese ideological world has this phenomenon is because the productivity of Chinese society does not develop, causing panic for the survival of the nation. The relations of production are, on the one hand, the restoration of ancient handicraft feudalism, and on the other hand, Europeanized capitalism. These two relative paths of economic life reflect the current relative ideological world.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of 'modern'? Simply put, it is decadent hedonism. Dancing, sports, and movies are the main ways this is displayed. Everything in life takes it as a dazzling standard. Men and women in universities walk into dance halls embracing each other, nude dancing performances in movie theaters sell out, and clothing is decorated according to female celebrities as the standard. Openings must also invite female celebrities. Therefore, modern women also learn the 'lewdness' and 'heat' of female celebrities to attract men. On the men's side, they are enthusiastic about sports. A portrait of a modern man is one wearing shorts, with bare arms, and wearing many medals, a person full of vanity and sensuality. Thus, the marriage of male athletes and female celebrities is regarded as the most modern combination.</p>
<p>The trend of the times is such that people who call themselves gentlemen sing the lament of deteriorating customs and morals, and come up with many old methods to save it, such as advocating the reading of scriptures movement, and someone petitioning the authorities to restore the old etiquette, and other significant facts.</p>
<p>The image of the ideological world entering two extremes has truly made the general youth dizzy. Calls for not being able to get through, and cries of annoyance and pain, can be heard everywhere. News of young people committing suicide because they have no way out in their thinking is also heard from time to time. If this phenomenon is still allowed to take its course, it will ultimately not be a blessing for the party and the country.</p>
<p>Now, the 'New Life Movement' promoted by our hardworking and meritorious party, military, and political officials is to correct this relative ideological world, eliminate 'modernization' and 'restoration of antiquity,' to start afresh with the people and be a pioneer for the people. All my people, let us rise up and support the 'New Life Movement.'</p>
<p>songs, in harmony with our 'rustling' footsteps. Ah, how poetic and great nature is! I was intoxicated...</p>
<p>'Don't move!' said the little friend in front. So, tiptoeing and gently squatting on the ground; in front of the small, white, chubby hands, a butterfly was perched. 'Haha! I caught it, it's a swallowtail butterfly. Let's take it back to make a specimen!'</p>
<p>We arrived at the vegetable garden, looking at those green and lovely vegetables, ah! That is our achievement.</p>
<p>'Mr. ×, we need to apply some fertilizer. We can eat it in another week.'...</p>
<p>This kind of life, one could live a lifetime without getting tired of it! We also got along with the farmers. In our busy lives, we founded a people's night school, setting aside two hours every night to teach at the night school and helping illiterate people learn to read. We opened the library and allowed people in the village to read newspapers and books. When we had important news, we published a 'people's wall newspaper' and posted it on the walls in the village.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the farmers had free time, they gathered under the trees to chat. 'Go, go and call the teachers to tell us stories!' In this way, the open-air lecture began again.</p>
<p>We also set up a 'People's Scribe Office' and a 'People's Inquiry Office' to serve the people in the village.</p>
<p>'Young, really good people!' What we received was the villagers' sincere gratitude. Although it was hard work, this kind of spiritual comfort was sweet.</p>
<p>Good times don't last forever. The local tyrants and evil gentry in the village gradually became dissatisfied with us, because we taught the farmers a lot of new knowledge, which they didn't like. After we encouraged the students to destroy the side room of the Guan Di Temple next to the school to make a library, they openly opposed us even more. These evil gentry created obstacles for us in everything. They spread many unpleasant rumors about us.</p>
<p>Did we want to add school supplies? The financial manager replied:</p>
<p>'Okay, later. It's not convenient with money now.'</p>
<p>The student football team went on an expedition and asked the school board for subsidies, but received an unreasonable rebuff.</p>
<p>In short, they messed up everything for us, and they made it impossible for us to develop anything. Finally, at the end of this semester, we had to end our teaching life.</p>
<p>'Mr. ×, don't leave! If you leave, we will have to live a dry and boring life again, we will no longer study!' Although the children tried to keep us in this way, the day we had to leave finally arrived.</p>
<p>'Mr. ×, don't forget us! Write us some letters!' When we got on the boat, the friends who saw us off on the dock said. From their bright eyes, on their red cheeks, dropped sparkling tears...</p>
<p>The wind was still blowing the same way, and the water was still flowing the same way, but it was winter weather. A thin layer of ice seemed to cover our warm hearts. Our beautiful fantasies turned into bubbles.</p>
<h3 id="e299">Sedan Chair Porters of Sichuan <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>'Creak, creak, creak, creak, two shoulders used as a horse'</p>
<p>This is a Sichuan fairytale, but it is what sedan chair porters least like to hear. I remember when I was young, I once took a sedan chair to my grandmother's house. On the way, the sedan chair bumped somehow and frightened me. I seemed to blame the sedan chair porters and casually hummed these two sentences. The sedan chair porters were very angry when they heard this and cursed: 'This short-lived ghost is hateful!'</p>
<p>Last year, when I returned to my hometown and took a sedan chair again, I encountered a sedan chair porter who deliberately gave me trouble. However, I couldn't bear to hum this 'shoulders used as a horse' tune anymore, even though their lives were actually worse than mules and horses!</p>
<p>Sedan chair porters in Sichuan are politely called 'carrying masters,' and bitterly scolded as 'killing mules' in a more vicious way. Because their scope of exertion is different, sedan chair porters are divided into three types: 'long shift,' 'extra shift,' and 'crossing street shift.'</p>
<p>'Long shift' specializes in soliciting long-distance business. They make their own sedan chairs. For example, from our × county to Chengdu, this 360-mile long journey requires hiring them. After the price is agreed upon, the sedan chair porters must be given 'tooth-beating festival' – eating wine and meat – the day before the passenger departs. Once on the road, the sedan chair porters are responsible for their own food and lodging, and the passenger does not care. On the road, they have to walk eight or ninety miles of rugged mountain roads every day. The wage is on average two hundred wen per mile – split equally by the two porters. They dare not eat their fill – it is said that eating their fill makes it difficult to carry the sedan chair. They can only eat a bowl of 'hat top' – a bowl of rice – with pickled vegetables four or five times a day. Each bowl of 'hat top' costs about four hundred wen. After each meal, they have to smoke one or two pans of opium, each pan costing five hundred wen. 'Check in before nightfall, and look at the sky early at cockcrow.' They can strictly abide by these two mottoes on the lanterns at the door of the inn without fail. Whenever the sky is about to darken, they rush to the station as if someone is whipping them from behind, to prepare a room for the guests, pack the luggage from the sedan chair into the room, and check the number. Then, they go to eat or smoke opium, waiting for the guests at the inn to arrive. They then pinch out two hundred wen to ask the 'young master' – the waiter at the inn – to bring them a bed of ragged and dirty bedding, which they each take to spread on the ground outside the threshold of the passenger's room, or at the base of the inn's counter, lying down like dry firewood to recover from their fatigue all day long. The next day, as soon as the east turns white, they immediately crawl out of their bedding, pack the sedan chair, and prepare to return to their journey where they cannot even eat their fill.</p>
<p>'Extra shift' is the generally known 'extra shift craftsmen.' They do not have their own sedan chairs. Every day, as soon as it is light, they squat in small shops next to the road – there is a small shop every five or six miles in Shu, selling cigarettes, tea, 'hat tops,' etc. Long-distance sedan chair porters may get tired, fail to reach the station, or get sick midway – sedan chair porters are most prone to heatstroke, stomach pain, and other illnesses. They then have to find 'extra shift' to carry the sedan chair for ten or eight miles. 'Extra shift' can only get one hundred and fifty or sixty wen per mile, and the remaining forty or fifty wen still goes to 'long shift.' They always carry the sedan chair back and forth on a certain section of the road, doing 'round-trip' business. When business is good, they earn even more money than 'long shift.'</p>
<p>'Crossing street shift' specializes in carrying business in the city. Their sedan chairs are purchased from guilds. Once they get business, the price is always a little higher than 'long shift' and 'extra shift,' earning four or five hundred wen per mile. However, in recent years, the economic panic has penetrated everywhere. Every city in Sichuan is inevitably facing an increase in the number of unemployed, and sedan chair porters must抢</p>

<h3 id="e300">Clothing and Social Life <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Lan</p>
<p>Recently, we often hear on newspapers compatriots advocating domestic goods opposing wearing Western clothes and news of destroying Western clothes. The reasons they oppose, roughly, are no different from what Mr. Tianxu Wosheng said the other day: 'Foreigners come to China to preach, and they still wear our Chinese clothes. We don't go to foreign countries to be foreign slaves, so why should we change to wearing Western clothes?'</p>
<p>Although I am not a wearer of Western clothes, I think that those who oppose wearing Western clothes, whether in terms of theory or method, are inevitably滑稽. I believe that advocating domestic goods and wearing Western clothes are not opposed. The reasons for the decline of the silk weaving industry are, on the one hand, affected by the global depression; on the other hand, it is because (1) China's tariffs cannot be completely autonomous, that is, it cannot use tariff barriers to prevent the import of foreign clothing materials, especially artificial silk, (2) Chinese silk weaving products cannot be improved, and (3) the bankruptcy of China's rural economy has reduced or even destroyed rural purchasing power.</p>
<p>If our tariffs can be completely autonomous and can prevent the import of foreign clothing materials, even if the Chinese change to wearing Western clothes, they can only use domestic materials, and there will be no outflow of profits. Why is China's national industry not actively urging the government to fight against imperialism and implement protectionist trade policies, but instead happily pointing fingers at compatriots who should not wear Western clothes? Isn't that strange?</p>
<p>Scolding Western clothes wearers as slaves who betray their country, if this can be used as a reason to oppose wearing Western clothes, it can only be applied to a part of people, that is, it applies to people who wear Western clothes as noble and glorious. If you use this reason to oppose the popularity of Western clothes and all Western clothes wearers, it is wrong.</p>
<p>In general, those who advocate Chinese clothes and oppose Western clothes, their biggest mistake is that they do not understand the relationship between clothing styles and social life. They do not know that clothing styles take an adaptive attitude towards social culture and life, which cannot be easily controlled by human power.</p>
<p>For example, why do monks, whether Chinese or foreign, always wear very loose and long clothes, while farmers and craftsmen often wear short clothes? The reason is: monks are people who do not work and eat, and even if they sometimes work, it is only mental, not physical. Therefore, the loose and long clothes they wear not only do not hinder them, but also show a special spirit and majesty. As for farmers and craftsmen, they are all physical laborers, and if they wear the clothes of monks, they will not be able to work at all. Therefore, they cannot but wear short and tight clothes.</p>
<p>We are now in the era of 20th-century mechanical civilization. All production uses machines, all transportation and traffic use machines, and even our daily life, sitting and lying, every move is related to mechanical civilization. Therefore, our clothing must take an adaptive attitude towards this mechanical civilization. Those millions of factory laborers standing in front of machines and those millions of engineers, drivers, chauffeurs, and sailors who deal with machines every day should pay close attention to the adaptability of their clothing styles to their working environment. It goes without saying that even general professionals such as doctors, clerks, company salesmen, and even ordinary residents, in this industrial civilization society, cannot but pay attention to the convenience of their clothing and its adaptability to social life. If you wear a Chinese robe and take a plane, or wear a Chinese palace dress and sit in a car, even if you can be careful and cautious, and escape the danger of life, you will inevitably feel great hindrance and inconvenience. Western-style clothing is the clothing that adapts to the 20th-century mechanical civilization society. If we want to pay attention to the lightness and comfort of clothing, we cannot but advocate Western-style clothing, or at least, we should not oppose Western-style clothing.</p>
<p>People change the environment around them, and therefore change themselves to adapt to the environment. We change from an agricultural society to an industrial society, and we must change to wearing industrial society's clothes, just as we change from an agricultural society to an industrial society, we must change our political system. Chinese robes and large-sleeved clothes actually illustrate that for thousands of years, the Chinese scholar-official class has been non-laboring. These clothes should have the same fate as the Chinese queue, and the people do not need to bother to speak. And now, there are still people in this 20th-century mechanical civilization society who advocate Chinese clothes and oppose Western clothes, which makes people feel puzzled.</p>
<p>抢 business to succeed. Those who do not know how to搶 will not have customers all day long. A sedan chair porter in Chongqing complained: it is difficult to earn one yuan a day, but regardless of whether there is business or not, the sedan chair shop owner must collect five吊 'rental money' every day – ten吊 of copper coins are exchanged for one yuan in Sichuan.</p>
<p>The dozen or so吊 they earn every day is only enough to eat 'hat top' rice and smoke opium – there are no sedan chair porters in Sichuan who do not smoke opium. Wearing straw sandals and resting in inns is barely enough, but in recent years, they have invented the 'sedan chair bar tax' to be collected from the sedan chair porters! If it is said that sedan chair porters can also have the opportunity to donate a special tax and knock off a kind of extra 'fortune,' then it is in the hot summer, when a female passenger inadvertently leaves a little menstrual blood on the seat board, then they have to敲 you at least three or five吊, especially if she is dressed nicely.</p>

<p>— Translated by Shen Yi Wu</p>
<p>When I was walking along Fifth Avenue in New York that afternoon, I remembered that I needed to buy a stiff collar. So I stepped into a general merchandise store and explained to the clerk that I wanted to buy a stiff collar. He took one out of the box and showed it to me.</p>
<p>'This is the last one,' he sighed. At the same time, he pointed to the stiff collar he was wearing. This was indeed undeniable, the stiff collar was the same as his.</p>
<p>I really liked this stiff collar, so I asked the price.</p>
<p>'One dollar each.' This was the young clerk's reply, and at the same time he yawned. In fact, because of my weak economic ability, I was reluctant to buy a stiff collar for one dollar each. So I said to the clerk, please change it to one that costs two and a half角. As soon as I finished saying this, the clerk showed an unhappy look.</p>
<p>'Ah...' he said, with a bitter smile on his face: 'We don't have this kind of stiff collar, we have never had this kind of goods.'</p>
<p>'You will never buy such cheap goods on this Fifth Avenue street.' After he added this sentence, he took in the box, as if this matter was over. After thinking carefully, this kind of clerk is really unreasonable. He thought that I would never buy this two and a half角 stiff collar, which is really nonsense. Because I was able to buy it later, which really made his store able to 'close its doors.'</p>
<p>I went to the second store to try, and the clerk told me that they did not have any stiff collars cheaper than seven and a half角. However, his attitude towards customers was completely kind and amiable, and he expressed his apologies to me.</p>
<p>'We often see that general customers are attracted by high prices,' he explained to me this way: 'They think that good goods are not cheap, and cheap goods are not good. This concept is fundamentally wrong. Countless white nobles are using this kind of cheap stiff collar.'</p>
<p>After hearing his words, you may think that this clerk does not know the threshold for doing business. In fact, it is not so. In my opinion, he is indeed a polite salesman, because he pleases people with his amiable appearance, which makes me have to spend money to buy one.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that a certain large branch store is on the verge of bankruptcy, even though it was quite reputable in the whole town in the year it was opened. And I have calculated that the only reason for his failure lies in 'losing the public.' The prices of various goods in his store were all reasonable and fair, but because customers wanted to exchange a chair clock after buying it home, the clerks showed a kind of embarrassing appearance. They often checked the goods and said: 'I don't know about this' to perfunctorily deal with customers.</p>
<p>So the customers said to themselves hatefully: 'I hope I will never step into this kind of shop for profit again.'</p>
<p>A large grocery store firmly remembers the creed of showing humility to customers. They often say to customers: 'Thank you, please come again next time.' No matter how bad the customers' temper is, or even if they insult the clerks for no reason, they have to silently admit their mistakes. For example, the clerk should use euphemistic words when refusing to use inferior coins or counterfeit foreign coins. If a customer pays you a lead coin, you must not scold him, you should say to him with a gentle attitude: 'There are a lot of lead coins on the market now, sir, I don't know where one got mixed in...'</p>
<p>There is no more surprising example of generating wealth through harmony than the hotel industry. The first person to realize this fact should be George Paner, of today's Rainbow. Until his death, he was still recognized as a major traveler in the hotel industry.</p>
<p>'Politeness is the cheapest thing in the world,' Paner often said: 'But it is not easy to buy, it requires a great price.'</p>
<p>Paner insisted on the rule that the customer is always right. This rule is now widely used. For example, if a guest at a banquet says that the fish tastes bad and tells the waiter that the fish is spoiled, the waiter, although he firmly believes that the fish is not spoiled, must not retort to the customer: 'Where is it spoiled?' He must quickly remove the fish basin and politely ask the customer: 'Sir, what dish shall I replace it with?'</p>
<p>Paner daily wrote down the list of sick travelers on the table. If it was a serious illness, he would immediately go to his room to comfort his illness. If it was a woman, he would also send her a bunch of flowers.</p>
<p>There is also a small grocery store with this kind of harmony attitude. I once bought a postcard from it. I gave him a nickel coin and he gave me four cents change, and also said 'Thank you', as if this was a big business. I asked him the reason why he was so polite, and the manager explained to me: 'This is one of our store rules. We do not dislike retail buyers. Because using a pleasant attitude towards him will make him come again next time. Patronize.'</p>
<p>Many public service companies, such as gasoline and electric light companies, often treat dissatisfied customers with a kind of 'what are you doing here' attitude. However, today it has completely changed. They have hired inspectors in their stores, specializing in teaching these employees who do not treat customers well.</p>
<p>Everyone can recall the impolite wording of large companies' billing statements a few years ago, which have all been changed today. Like this kind of majority:</p>
<p>'...Your esteemed account may have been forgotten due to your busy affairs. We hereby re-mention it, hoping that you will pay it as soon as possible.'</p>
<p>Movie theaters should also be like this. When a woman comes late and there are no seats in the hall, the ticket seller must not say the lost sentence, 'The downstairs is full!' You should say to her very harmoniously: 'Madam, there are seats upstairs, priced at two yuan and two and a half yuan. ' Because people always like to hear pleasant words, and are not used to hearing hard-nosed words.</p>

<h3 id="e302">The Story of an Airplane <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Ming</p>
<p>Before Christmas, my wife asked the children what clothes they wanted for the New Year, planning to have them made. My six-year-old daughter, Huzi, answered without hesitation, "I want a flight attendant uniform, I want to be a female aviator." We all laughed at the time, but we actually listened to her and had a leather suit made for her, and even bought her a small airplane.</p>
<p>Why did this child develop the idea of becoming an aviator? It's not without reason. First, of course, is curiosity. Aviators can go to the sky, and those who can go to the sky are naturally extraordinary people. She also often heard people say that there are female aviators in foreign countries, so she also wants to be someone above others. Second, naturally, it was the terrifying impact of the January 28th Incident. Although she was only four years old at the time and didn't understand the horrors of war, she had heard many war stories. She knew that Japan had more airplanes than China, and the Chinese air force didn't really fight Japan that time, which made her feel very indignant, and she felt she had to become an aviator. Third, it should also be attributed to the aviation atmosphere in the country in recent years. We often hear about foreign airplanes coming to China to perform, and we hear the miscellaneous sounds of airplanes in the sky every day, which naturally deepened her interest.</p>
<p>The parents of the aspiring aviator had to find popular materials, learning themselves while giving the children more accurate concepts. As a result, our family often had aviation conversations, and we had a small, armed female aviator and a small airplane.</p>
<p>My fourth younger brother studies airplane manufacturing, and he cleverly says that he can also fly them himself. Unfortunately, he is far away in Lingnan and can't come to our house often. However, in the children's minds, their fourth uncle is naturally stronger than their father. He is someone to be admired. In order to satisfy the children's wishes, when my fourth brother recently returned to our hometown, the first time I saw him, I told him about the children's admiration and invited him to give an aviation lecture to the children at our house. The following is his conversation with the children.</p>
<p>"Fourth Uncle! How can airplanes fly? Who came up with the idea?"</p>
<p>"Airplanes aren't really that strange. Birds soar through the clouds and fly high in the sky. Didn't they learn aviation tens of millions of years ago? If birds can learn it, humans certainly can too! The current airplanes were thought of from the fact that birds can 'fly'. They all use a special method to manipulate the air and ensure flight. You must know that all inventors in the world are not just daydreaming. They carefully observe everything and invent things for practical use. For example, scale insects, bees, flies, bats, and birds are all teachers of mankind. They were the earliest aviators, and humans learned the art of 'artificial flight' from their flying. It's very common."</p>
<p>"Birds' bodies are light! How can airplanes, such heavy things, fly? I really don't understand?"</p>
<p>"Haha! Do you think light things can fly? Ants are lighter than birds' bodies, and centipedes are lighter than scale insects. Why can't they fly? On the contrary, weight is a necessary condition for flight. Anything that can fly must be heavier than air. If birds were lighter than air and flew, then a strong wind would blow them away to who knows where. How could they fly back and forth freely? Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I still don't understand. There are many things heavier than air! Why can't they fly?"</p>
<p>"I said that weight is only one condition. Besides weight, you also need appropriate flight organs and strength. Birds have weight, appropriately constructed flight organs, and can generate appropriate force to interact with the air, so they can fly. Airplanes are the same. If there isn't a proper combination, they can't fly. Birds' surfaces are naturally reduced to a minimum, but they can increase their active surface by vibrating their wings when necessary. When the wings vibrate rapidly, they turn the space they pass through into a strong foundation to support their bodies. The speed of the wing vibration must be higher than the speed of any wind. This way, it can control the wind and fly in any direction in the wind. Don't we often see birds' wings constantly vibrating in strong winds? Eagles, who are in the clear blue sky, just spread their wings and are too lazy to vibrate. That's the reason. However, birds' flight organs are active wings. Humans have now changed to propellers. Its purpose is the same: to attack and subdue the air, not to be attacked and subdued by the air."</p>
<p>"Fourth Uncle, why can airplanes fly upside down and fly tilted?"</p>
<p>"This is the same as how ships need to tilt when sailing. It's about controlling the air. The vibration of the wings in the air is like the oars of a boat in the water. 'When the wings flap downward, they strike downward and forward, and when they flap upward, they strike upward and forward, drawing a figure '8' in the air.' Airplanes also adopt this principle."</p>
<p>The child was listening with great interest, but was interrupted by dinner. This lecture made the child feel closer to birds.</p>

<h3 id="e303">Eugenics and the Nation <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tianhua</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power in Germany, he has been strengthening the military, working hard to govern, and trying to restore the national destiny shackled by the Treaty of Versailles. Recently, he has also formulated eugenics laws in order to improve the race and benefit future world wars. According to a Havas news dispatch on the 15th:</p>
<p>"Germany previously promulgated eugenics laws, prohibiting people with weak bodies, criminal records, or mental illnesses from marrying, so that bad seeds would be cut off from now on; and healthy races would become stronger. After the order was issued, the whole country followed. Now, in order to make the implementation of this order more closely supervised, all doctors and judges in the country will be given special education... The Saxon state government firmly believes that the Nordic people are uniquely blessed by nature. In terms of the spiritual and physical value given by the Creator, the components of the Nordic people are 'superior components'. Therefore, it plans to establish a research institute specializing in racial studies and national health in Dresden..."</p>
<p>Eugenics and national hygiene are originally related. The seeds of plants and animals can be artificially improved, so there is no reason why the human race cannot be improved. The concept of "selection" is not only applicable to the natural world, but also to humans. And heredity is the most important key to selection. Since Mendel's law of heredity came out, we know that heredity has quantitative laws to follow; since Weismann's theory of germ plasm came out, we know that heredity has a material basis to rely on. From this, eugenics becomes completely possible. Understanding this, it is very natural that the eugenics movement is promoted by nationalists. But there are debatable points in Germany's eugenics law. Physical weakness is not necessarily congenital. Malnutrition and disease are often the biggest causes of weakness. Furthermore, weakness is not absolutely unchangeable. If it were unchangeable, what would be the use of various sports, competitions, and boxing? Criminals are not necessarily unhealthy people, and there are extremely intelligent people among criminals. Moreover, the reasons for their crimes are mostly due to social evils and economic oppression. As for people with mental illnesses, although most of their nerves are unhealthy, the source of their illness is mostly acquired and not incurable. Moreover, there are extremely intelligent geniuses among the patients. If we cut off their reproductive functions for these people, it would be cruel in terms of humanity, oppression of the people in terms of politics, and a loss in terms of national interests.</p>
<p>But Hitler's vision is different. He believes that "dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, and smart and healthy people beget smart and healthy people." He wants to use his eugenics law to make the German nation strong. He is completely taking the interests of the country as the premise.</p>
<p>I am not against eugenics, but I am not satisfied with this deformed eugenics. Instead of promoting this kind of eugenics, we should promote a superior environment. First, these eugenics activists often have wrong ideas, viewing the dominant figures in current society as humans who are fit for survival, believing that only the upper class should reproduce, while the majority of people are ignored. Eugenics is an aristocratic science from this point of view.</p>
<p>Second, these eugenics activists are manufacturers of war. Their advocacy of racial improvement is aimed at obtaining more strong soldiers and seizing other people's land and conquering colonies with greater certainty. Hitler's strict implementation of eugenics laws and Mussolini's encouragement of marriage can all be explained in this sense.</p>
<p>Third, instead of striving for racial transformation, we should strive for economic transformation. We cannot deny the right to life of human beings, and we see that economic transformation contributes more to mankind than other efforts. If we improve the environment for mankind, human society will naturally progress, and the human race will naturally tend towards evolution.</p>
<p>In our country, the remaining feudal consciousness shrouds society. The concept of social status, wealth, and poverty in marriage already contains the meaning of eugenic selection, as if it understands the meaning of eugenics. However, our nation is still decadent and lewd. Seeing that promoting eugenics will inevitably lead into a dead end, we should still strive to transform the nation's economic environment.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Recent World Economy</p>
<p>— Fanfu</p>
<p>Although it is said that the world economic panic is still deepening, when we review the various statistics of the world economy in 1933, the facts are somewhat different. If you don't believe me, please see:</p>
<p>Index of Industrial Production in 1933</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>
<p>United States 57.7 69.3</p>
<p>United Kingdom 88.4 91.7 (Average of July, August, and September) Germany 61.2 68.6 France 75.6 84.6 Japan 107.9 139.4 (November)</p>
<p>The index of industrial production is generally used by economists as a compass for economic conditions. If the production index is high, it means that industry is developed and the economy is prosperous, thus forming prosperity. Conversely, if the production index is lower than before, it means that production is depressed and the economy is exhausted, thus forming a recession. The above production index table is calculated using the production index of 1928 as the base. According to the table, the production indexes of the five major capitalist countries, the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Japan, in 1933 were all higher than the indexes of the previous year. Therefore, some economists excitedly shouted, "The recession is about to pass, and prosperity is coming soon!"</p>
<p>Not only does the production index show the hope of improvement, but prices in various countries also show an upward trend. Look:</p>
<p>Index of Commodity Prices in 1933 (Wholesale)</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>
<p>United States 92 94*</p>
<p>United Kingdom 86 86 Germany 96 93 France 83 79 (December) Japan 121 135</p>
<p>Like the production index, commodity prices are also regarded as a compass for economic conditions. If commodity prices fall compared to before, it indicates overproduction and a reduction in social consumption, thus indicating a recession. If commodity prices rise compared to before, it indicates an increase in social demand, thus indicating signs of prosperity. The above commodity price index table uses 1913, the year before the war, as the base. This table tells us that commodity prices in major capitalist countries are almost all rising together. Therefore, optimistic economists shouted again, "The world economy has now moved from a recession to a sluggish stage!" After sluggishness comes prosperity.</p>
<p>But has the world recession really passed? Here we have to make a calm observation.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the expansion of production. Although the average index for the whole year of 1933 was higher than that of 1932, this rise was unusually volatile. The production indexes of the major capitalist countries in the first half of 1933 almost all rose consistently, but once it reached June, the production indexes of the countries began to decline again. Japan was the earliest (June), followed by France (July), followed by the United States (August), and then Germany (September).</p>
<p>This fully proves that the expansion of production in 1933 was only a temporary expansion. This expansion was entirely stimulated by the artificial policies of various governments. When it reached a certain point, it would eventually reveal its true colors.</p>
<p>In fact, if we take off the signboard of "production expansion" and pay attention to the continued increase in the number of unemployed people and the continued reduction in workers' wages, then we can conclude that this expansion of production will never be sustained.</p>
<p>Now let's analyze the abnormal rise in commodity prices. The increase in commodity prices in various countries is also entirely due to the "commodity price recovery policy" of various governments. Under this policy, the first step is to increase tariffs or prohibit the import of foreign goods in order to form a monopoly price for domestic goods. In addition to this method, various monetary policies, such as stopping gold redemption and devaluing gold currencies, are used to raise nominal commodity prices. The high prices in the price index table for Britain, the United States, and Japan are due to this. Because Germany and France did not devalue their currencies, commodity prices showed a decline. Therefore, the increase in the commodity price index is ultimately just an illusion of various governments.</p>
<p>Not only has the world recession not passed, but it has become increasingly deepened due to this false expansion of production and the false rise in commodity prices. On the reverse side of production expansion are: overproduction, accumulation of military supplies, etc.; on the reverse side of the rise in commodity prices are: increasingly fierce international commodity wars and international currency wars. It is feared that the transition from economic war to armed war will eventually be unavoidable!</p>

<p>Biography of a Famous Person</p>
<h3 id="e305">Marconi, Inventor of the Wireless Telegraph (3) <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Senran</p>
<p>Marconi's research progressed day by day. In July 1897, he left the hands of Preece and established the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company with a capital of one million yuan, and invited J.A. Fleming as a consultant. In 1898, he was again ordered to establish wireless telegraph receiving and sending stations between the Isle of Wight and Bournemouth, a distance of twelve miles. In August of the same year, the sick British Crown Prince (The Prince of Wales) and Queen Victoria often communicated by wireless telegraph, and Marconi was responsible for their communication, which attracted the greatest attention of the British people at that time.</p>
<p>The wireless telegraph communication between Queen Victoria and the Crown Prince was 30 miles long. Marconi's success here can be said to be a leap forward in the process of his invention of the wireless telegraph. In this wireless telegraph device, there was an Antenna pole standing on the coast that was 105 feet high, and an Antenna that was 83 feet long, which at that time had to be said to be a surprising creation.</p>
<p>At this time, people were holding a rowing competition. However, the final point of the competition was set in the ocean 20 miles away. People who went to watch the competition by boat could naturally immediately know the news of the victory or defeat, but the audience on the shore had to wait until the boat returned to know. At this time, the audience with fanatical emotions was naturally not very happy. Therefore, a news agency took the opportunity to use Marconi's wireless telegraph. As a result, the news of the final point 20 miles away could be immediately transmitted by wireless telegraph. As a result, the unhappy feeling of the fanatical audience was immediately eliminated. -- This was the first time that the wireless telegraph was used for ordinary application, and it was also the beginning of Marconi's fame in Britain.</p>
<p>In 1899, at the request of the French government, Marconi engaged in communication experiments across the English Channel between England and France. He erected a 150-foot-high Antenna in Dover, England and Wimereux, France, and used a wavelength of 12,000 meters. The result was a great success, and wireless telegraph communication across the English Channel was realized. As a result, there were increasingly practical opportunities for rapid communication between ships at sea and ships on the coast. At that time, there were already lightships equipped with wireless telegraph devices to rescue steamships that had run aground in dense fog. This was an example.</p>
<p>The most interesting and complete experiment of Marconi's maritime communication was during British naval exercises. Because the exercise required wireless telegraph communication, Marconi seized this opportunity and worked hard. In the autumn of one year, during a major exercise by the British Navy, he successfully established communication between the two ships Europa and Jarrow, which were 60 nautical miles apart. Later, the British Navy continued to pay him a royalty of 200,000 yuan for using the wireless telegraph he invented.</p>
<p>In 1899, the South African War broke out. Marconi's assistant also went to the battlefield, and Marconi's wireless telegraph actually rescued the isolated state of the South African besieged army in January 1900. This was the first time that the wireless telegraph showed its power in the military. (To be continued)</p>
