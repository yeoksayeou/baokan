<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國之無敵海軍計劃野</h3>
<p>據本報昨訊。倫敦方面海軍初步談話旣吿停頓。而日本海軍閥復要求完全脫離條的束縳。故美國海軍部長史璜生亦重申政府之最優勢海軍建造計畫。按美國海軍之大規模之飛機建造計畫。業經核准。不久卽可動工。如和平之談判失效。則列强之備戰自亟。當此太平洋形勢日益嚴重而吾國國防極度空虚之際。吾人對於美國之所謂最優勢海軍建造計劃。良有一加注意之必要也。</p>
<p>美國最優勢之海軍計劃。實針對日本之要求海軍平等而發此計畫包含於前數月美國國會所通過之文生法案中。此項計畫。可分爲三點。一爲軍艦之建造。二爲飛機之添置。三爲人員之增加。如依其計畫以行。則至民國三十一年。美國將有嶄新之戰艦二百隻。飛機二千一百八十四架。海軍官員十萬五千人。新艦中包括戰鬥艦。八英吋砲徑及六英吋砲徑之巡洋艦。航空母艦六艘。驅逐艦九十七艘。潛水艇三十六艘。屆時超過艦齡而尙可用之軍艦。尙未計算在内。似此碩大無朋之海軍。英日二國。將莫之與京。</p>
<p>溯自羅斯福總統主政以來。海軍派勢力大張。此中原因。人皆知其在於日本在遠東勢力澎漲有打破太平洋均勢局面之野心。前此國會已有擴充計畫通過。然規模不大。且其中數艦之建築經費。尙未核准俟文生法案通過後。美國始决定添造新艦一百零二艘。更可注意者。此計畫規定以後艦齡已滿之軍艦替代辦法。及兵艦上之飛機之添置。軍艦之數。雖與倫敦及華盛頓條約相符。而飛機之數。則遠超於今之所有。至於計畫之實施。則爲五年一次。至民國三十年。全部完成。</p>
<p>計畫實施之費用約自三萬八千萬至六萬萬美金使明年之海軍會議無結果。則國會將逐年撥出經費。必使其全部完成。本年國會已撥二千五百萬美金。而海軍之常年造艦費。尙不在内。飛機之增加。爲一千一百八十四架。其總費用爲九千五百萬美金。據美海軍當局言。巡洋艦一艘。將帶有飛機六架。在戰時則自六架增至十二架。人員方面。亦將逐年增加。美國現有海軍人員。約八萬人。而本年國會預算。已添至八萬五千人。人今試略舉諸大海軍國之現有實力。計美國之正式現役軍艦。共八十四艘。多屬於巨艦型。砲徑大而宜於大洋中航行。英國軍艦凡百三十七艘。日本百六十六艘。實力比較。蓋以美爲最强。蓋美所領海岸。不若英之遼遠。而美之海軍噸數。復超於日本。現在建造中之軍艦。美爲五十二艘。英爲四十七艘。日爲四十七艘。根拋倫敦及華盛頓二約中所定之比例。美尙需百零二艘。英尙需六十一艘。始能滿額。而日本則已滿額。文生法案。卽爲建造此百零二艘軍艦而產生者也。美海軍當局謂此計畫實施後。英美平等之原則。可以化爲實際。然其趨勢。則猶駕英而上之也。</p>
<p>文生氏之言曰。「美國現有海軍力。雖已足保全國家之安全。然爲保全海外屬地及通商權利計。則猶不勝此項計畫。目的衛護國家之政策及商業。使美國之對外政策。通行無礙。以海軍保障世界和平實爲唯一可行之辦法。「觀乎此言。則羅斯福政府之對外態度。可以明知。羅斯福固一唯實主義信徒。不尙空談。而注意於實力之高下。其對日本也。不談條約之權利義務。不提外交之原理與手縐。而以大海軍爲其發言之機關。此日本外務省之所以漸感困難。而駐美日使齋藤氏之所以忽忽來往於太平洋上也。</p>
<p>自滿洲事件後。諸國對於日内瓦之標語口號。日感灰心。而强權卽公理之信念。則與日俱堅。吾國國防。固無計劃可言。當今諸强國不惜積極備戰。而我猶不思準備。圖於苟且中延殘喘。縱觀中外。能不凛然。</p>

<h3>德意兩首揆威尼斯的會談（德國通信）</h3>
<p>德國發揮其恊調外交意國努力於縱橫政策希特勒高倡軍備平等、意思是在要衝破凡爾賽體系、可惜他的外交手段、太不高明、在國外連奥國的同情都失去了、對意大利的好感、也是若有若無、而且國内各方面、甚至於國社黨内部、都隱隱中有了許多非難、對希特勒政府、表示不滿、第一·就是國社黨的左右派、在他的權力基礎的衝鋒隊組織中、有了很顯明的分化作用、這如果發酵起來、會釀成國社黨自身分裂的危險、第二·是勞工大衆、受壓迫太深、反抗的情緒、亦漸見膨脹、希特勒執政一年半以來、雖說是使四百萬失業工人、重新就業、可是他們的生活、並沒有改善、如果禍變一旦爆發、很容易使現政府陷於最大危險的地位、第三·是以國防軍爲中心的保守勢力所發生的革命危險、德國的國防軍裹面領導的力量、都在普魯土地主手裹、他們對於國社黨早就有許多的不滿、要從右邊加以打擊、現在反希特勒的空氣、漸次濃厚、雖不必就首先發難、但亦足以促成德國的不安、</p>
<p>因以上種種關係、希特勒政府、要在國内求出路、在事實上很不容易、最後的一着、還是要用外交手段、以移轉其國民視綫、以提高德意志的地位、但是高調都唱過了、德波關係、也轉變了、祇有對意大利進行和好的外交、是於德國有利的、同時意大利黑衣宰相、又提議請德總理希特勒到威尼斯一遊、交換彼此意見、希氏有此機會、欣然承受、遂於六月十四日偕諾拉徳外長及隨員十餘名、乘兩架大型飛機自南徳的萌亨出發到意大利、由意國飛機領導、到了桑尼柯洛飛機塲、墨索里尼就在那裹迎候希氏、他們握手言歡之後、於大衆歡呼聲中、軍隊嚴重警戒之下</p>
<p>、乘汽車到水鄉威尼斯、在格蘭特旅舍少息、卽赴彼薩尼别莊墨索里尼的午餐會、餐後、兩位獨裁宰相、在另一個房子裹秘密商談、並沒有第三個人參加、其會談的内容、密不發表、祇在他們十五日共同發表的聲明中說「意德兩國的宰相、就一般的政策、尤其是意德兩國有直接關係各種問題的檢討、現以懇切恊力的精神討論完了、並且意德兩國首領間的個人關係、到將來也要繼續下去的、」這裹比較重要的是說到他們「個人關係將來也要繼續、「至於内容究竟何如、還是不甚淸楚、但據與希特勒接近的某人、於六月十五夜發表非正式的談話說、「兩位宰相的晤談、所涉及的範圍是很廣泛、並屬於一般的性質、這個晤談的結果、沒有什麽文書的交換、所以對歐洲政局、也不至於發生十分重大的影響、現在旣經兩位宰相互相諒解之後、在將來的政局上定會表現出來的、德意志政府、絶對不會立卽回到國際聨盟、對於軍縮問題、也沒有什麽具體的决定、」據一般觀測、以爲意徳兩首相的晤談、實際上有兩種較重要的意義、一個是關於東歐問題、這裹面包含有多腦河流域諸國的對意對德關係、同時也就是德法爭鬥勝敗的分歧點、再則還有對蘇聨的外交、意德對此利害不同、也很容易惹起糾粉、其他一個是奥國問題、本來德國有合併奥國的野心、同時奥國很難於自已獨立成一個國家、也願意合併於他同文同種的德意志、可是合併假如成功、德國勢力就會膨脹起來、這與法國固然不利、於意大利也有多少妨害、所以意德兩位宰相就同意維持奥國的獨立、還有一個附屬的共同一致的外交策略、就是反對經濟聨盟、換一句話說、是打破法國的獨霸運動、其次就是抵制蘇聨的東歐諸國的個别恊定、談話完結以後、希氏於十六日又乘飛機回德國來了、（六月十七日於柏林）</p>

<h3>無購洋米必要</h3>

<p>考察四川實業專員</p>
<h3>梅恕曾入京覆命</h3>
<p>行政院前派梅恕曾爲考察四川實業專員、梅君奉命後、卽啟程入川、調查川省實業狀况、與如何入手開發實業之計劃、歷時數月、當於十九日返滬、在途中因感受暑熱、過京時未卽覆命、抵滬後休養三日、業已恢復建康、爰於昨晚乘夜快車入京、晋謁汪行政院長、報吿此行所得、並詳陳開發四川實業意見、日日社記者昨晤梅君於寓、亟錄其談話如下、</p>
<p>川省實業狀况據梅君談、外省人對四川之批評、不曰天府之國、卽目之爲魔窟、其實此兩名詞、皆似是而非、四川土地肥沃、物產豐富、自昔已然、此天府美名之所由來也、然民元以來、因政局之不寗、干戈之擾攘、最近四川之出省物品、與入省物品相較、每年約入超一千萬元、入超如是之龐大、又安得謂之天府、至目爲魔窟者、則以四川徵稅、往往有預徵至數十年以上者、此則軍事時期之畸形現象、然川省因明季張獻忠之亂、田赋實較各省爲輕、而農產又復豐饒、故人民雖受如此剥削、亦當足以勉强支持、魔窟云云、亦未免言之過當、本人此次奉命入川考察、覺劉（湘）主席自統一軍事以後、在政治上、一切漸上軌道、期以歲月、當可盡滌過往之紛亂與黑暗、而使川政發生新光明、政治改良後、則社會情形、自亦可以隨之一新、全國之農材破產、與夫種種之不景氣、四川當然亦不能例外、然而川省土藏、實較他省爲富、誠能盡量開發、則所謂天府之國、庶幾可以名副其實開發根本計劃開發實業之道、千端萬緒、不知從何說起、而根本需要者、第一爲便利交通、如何修築必要之鐵道、與如何修築各縣間之公路、使四川血脈貫通、往來暢逹、此乃開發實業之先决問題、本人已與劉主席數度作縝密之商榷、此次入京、亦將向汪院長詳爲報吿、請予主持、第二爲資本、川人經濟力量有限、非吸收大量外資、共同合作、不足以言開發、顧實業家對於投資、往往存畏懼之心理、以四川以往情形言之、其畏懼當也、然以本人意見、則今非昔比、以往種種可畏懼之事實、以後將不復存在、故希望國内之大企業家、由畏懼之心理、進而爲懷疑、由懷疑而嘗試、由嘗試而成功、則源源投資、四川之幸、抑亦中國之幸矣、</p>
<p>希望銀界投資年來中國之銀行界、因工商業之不振、遊資之充斥、多數投資於地產與公債、此固自有其不得已之情形、然二者皆非正軌、於國於民、皆有相當之惡影響、本人以爲銀行界當以輔助工商業、發展人民生產量、爲第一要義、邇者、銀行界鉅子張公權君、固已有此覺悟矣、固已擬對四川投資矣、然甚望其投資方法、符合上述之要義、庶有以利我川人、勿但因四川放欵利息之較厚、而僅作表面之投資也、本人因四川自軍事統一而後、劉主席以有用之才、銳意振興、事有可爲、亦擬竭其所能、爲建設四川而努力、其詳細情形、當俟整理調查所得、逐漸發表、使國人明瞭四川　眞實狀况、共同致力云、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>經濟學上幾個問題的解釋</h3>
<p>｜｜答宋鴻翔君｜｜</p>
<p>問，從物物交換到商品生産之過程是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答，從物物交換到商品生產的過程，中間必經過貨幣發生的階段。社會生產力的發展，使生產品類增多、物物交換的方式對於人就非常不便、於是人們漸漸就從各種生產品中選擇一種比較有持久性的東西，作爲經常的交換標準品，這東西後來就發展而爲貨幣，貨幣制度確定之後、爲交換而生產的人們就把他們的生產品當作商品而拿到市塲上去出賣，這就開始了商品生產。</p>
<p>問，從物物交換到使用價値與價値之對立是予盾的展開。商品生產是使用價値與價値之對立的統一物。然而商品本身也是一個矛盾而起運動的主體，從商品到貨幣，從貨幣到資本，這中間辯證法的說明是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答，貨幣本來也是一種商品，貨幣由商品中分離出來，成爲商品的共通的媒介物，與商品形成一種對立，但商品能隨時轉化爲貨幣（即出賣商品），貨幣也能隨時轉化爲商品（即贈買商品），這是商品與貨幣的對立的統一。商品中又有一種特殊的商品，即勞働力。勞働力是能產生剩餘價値的，貨幣轉化爲這一種商品時（即購買了勞動力），其性質上便發生突變而能產生利潤。貨幣用在產生利潤的目的上時、便已不是普通的貨幣，而是資本了。這就是貨幣，商品，與資本的辯證法運動。</p>
<p>問，剩餘價値究竟是從那裹生產出來的？從使用價値呢？還是從價値生產出來的？</p>
<p>答，剩餘價値是從剩餘勞働產生的。剩餘價値就是剩餘勞働的交換價値（或單稱價値），而不是使用價値。因此也可以說剩餘價値是從價値裹產生的。</p>
<p>問，爲資本的貨幣之流通，其本身即是目的。資本到了爲資本而存在時，他的運動是無際限的。這句話怎樣說？</p>
<p>答，這句話的意思是：貨幣用作資本時，因爲資本的目的是在於要不斷地產生剩餘價値的緣故，所以這貨幣也就要不斷地流通，不斷地運動，而流通就成爲貨幣資本之目的，資本數要是不失其資本的意義，則必須無限制無止境地永遠運動下去。</p>
<p>問，商品之價値，由於他的生產所必要的勞働量而規定。此必要的勞働量，即是勞働力體現於現實的東西，即商品，換言之，商品的價値可以由勞働力的價値規定。這樣的解釋是否正確？</p>
<p>答，這樣的解釋是正確的。</p>

<h3>宣言</h3>
<p>我們深知今日中國的文壇、是處於普羅文學與頽廢文學兩大勢力的包圍之下、我們更深知今日中國文壇上之所謂作家、他們都是卑鄙齷齪、心懐叵測的國家蟊賊、他們只曉得迷戀於黃金的樂園、希望永久霸占着文壇上的優勢於是在和平的環境中、不時掀風作浪、企圖造成文壇上緊張的空氣、如「海派」「京派」與「平派」之爭、「文言文」「白話文」與「大衆語」之論、都是他們故弄玄虚、使用卑劣手段的醜惡表演、同時另一方面、則極力粉飾偶像、所謂「老總」所謂「大師」、在他們有計劃的吹捧之中、無非造成他們在文壇上君王與士大夫的地位、從而在他們暴力的壓迫之下、使一般純潔而優秀的作者、永沒有抬頭的一天、目前次殖民地的中國、可以說是遭遇到最困難的地步、猙獰的帝國主義者猛烈地在那裹掠奪與分贓、凶暴的土匪共駥、更在那裹搗亂與作惡、以致農村破產、工廠倒閉、商業凋零、使我們整個國家和社會、陷落於覆亡無日的地位、在這空前的嚴重時期、今日文壇上的一切普羅文藝、頽廢文藝、非但不能適合於社會的需要、而且影響於國家的生存、所以我們應當樹起革命的旗幟、對於這些文壇上的偶像、以及惡化思想的產物的不合此時代環境的文藝、都應當毫不客氣的宣吿他們的死刑、同時我們要整飭我們的陣綫、積極的建設意識向上的合乎社會需要、國家生存的新文藝、</p>
<p>歷史上所詔示於我們的、一種文藝的成功、决不是偶然的產物、而必有其客觀的條件、决定其發展或沒落的命運、如文藝復興以後、浪漫主義打倒擬古主義、與自然主義戰勝浪漫主義、都是我們很好的史實、現在中國文壇上之一切文藝、旣然不能適合於時代環境的需要、那末這些偶像作家的沒落、無聊文藝的崩潰、與我們革命陣綫的開展、新文藝運動的成功、乃是必然的結果、這裹、我們集合着大隊的忠勇的革命戰士、準備着衝上前綫、願意無條件的犠牲血和精神、來推進我們的新文藝運動、同時我們在嚴正的立塲上、理智的判斷下、不受任何黨派的指揮、在我們的工作進程中、更不畏强暴、不懼艱險、對於一切障碍、决以革命的手段排除、最後、我們熱望着表同情於我們的革命志士們、都來參加這偉大的陣營、</p>

<h3>網球新術（十二）</h3>
<p>Ｊ·ＰＡＲＭＬＹ　ＰＡＲＥＴ原著錢一勤洪均合譯｜版權所有不准轉載｜</p>
<p>至於講到從球頂扭擊（Ｔｏｐｐｅｄ　Ｓｌｒｏｋｅ｜｜｜）這種擊法是使球獲得最要緊的上方旋轉Ｔｏｐｓｐｉｈ｜｜｜那麽拍擊時球拍的擺動、是向上的、將球擊出後、球拍要一直擺到左肩上面、並且要儘量地便盡應付任何落地球所須要的擺動力、所以决定了採用此種方式的時候、球拍要預先向後一直擺到右肩的後面和上面、大概説起來、球拍預先向後擺動的長度、和將球拍出後球拍向前擺動的長度、要剛巧相等、　　球拍預先向後擺動的時間、應該洽巧算準、决不可在實行拍擊以前、使球拍停憇在後面、所以向後合拍的擺動、馬上就隨着擺向前去、不稍停憇、像這樣一後一前的輕便　活的擺動、才能產生拍擊時絶好的效果、世界聞名的正手拍擊法名家約翰斯登Ｗｉｌｌｉａｍ　Ｍ·Ｊｏｈｎｓｔｏｎ　ｏｆ　Ｃａｌｉｆｉａｉ的擺動方式、是値得模仿的、他總是在球拍預先擺到後面的時候、馬上將手腕一轉、使球拍在後面繞一小小的圓圈、而後繼續擺向前去、於是球拍向後向前的擺動、實際上連續不斷的、鐵而登也是採用這種方式、不過他、他將球拍在後面繞的圓圈、要比較小些和平些、凡是曾經採用此種方式的其他球員、都得到相當的成功、所以就證明了這是很有效的方式、</p>
<p>在來球落地剛要反躍的時候、球員的身軀就馬上要順着手勢向下擺動、於是肩部的力量、就先傳出、然後上臂前臂·手腕和球拍、都趁勢用力擺動、好像抽鞭一樣、於是拍擊時、就有絶大的力量、此種擺動身軀的原則、就正和擲籃球一樣、籃球名手準備擲遠球的時候、他的手法和身軀的擺動、必定是依着同樣的幾種程序｜｜肩部先轉動、再上臂擺動、再前臂伸直、再手腕擲球、這樣一步一步將動力輪流傳遞、所以到手腕正式擲球的時候、球飛出去、就有絶大的速率和力量、</p>
<p>此種身軀的擺動務要圓滑和靈利、不可梢成滯碍、所以雙足所立的方位、定要做倒到第二章内所講到的原則、就是要雙足和來球的飛程成平行綫、這並不是說、雙足的足趾要都向着來球的飛程成平行綫、乃正構笈足趾封着球的飛程應該差不多成直魚雙足分潤立着、彼此都在平行綫上、於是預先將身軀轉到　方便的地位、實行拍擊來球時、身軀的擺動、不致凝滯、</p>

<p>克勞福有幾次發球、精彩異乎精彩、其反手球使希爾士在底綫奔走不已、其抽球、亦勝而再勝、希兩士唯一之武器爲發球、但其空中球則甚弱、常見極容易之球觸網、克勞福集中全力於邊綫球、使却爾士不得不退守底綫、克勝第一盤非常容易、希爾士在第二盤中、錯誤纍纍、常見將容易之球、送入網内、第三盤中希曾以六比五及七比六佔先二次、但卒不克擊破克勞福之堅强守衛綫而敗、</p>

<p>麥格拉斯之勝伍特、全在其雙手之反手球、遂將伍特之最好戰法擊破、迨將完畢時、伍特之表演、極不小心、隨隨便便、將無數容易之正手抽球、送入網中、麥格拉斯在全部比賽中、非常穩健、反手抽、重而有力、正手抽亦能有可　管束、麥將第三盤放棄、最後復集中其全力於第四盤中、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>窮小孩的蹺蹺板</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>我今天接到一封匿名信。信壳上左面只寫「寄自上海法租界，七月十二日。」拆開來看，裹面這樣寫着：</p>
<p>子愷先生：</p>
<p>近來在自由談上。幾乎每天能見到你的插畫。你的畫好極了。倘要問我怎樣好法。却又說不出來。總之。很是耐人尋味的。</p>
<p>前數天偶然看見幾個窮小孩在玩。他們的玩法。我竟頗能作你畫稿的材料。而且很合你向來的作風。現在特地貢獻給你。以備採納。此視</p>
<p>康健。一個敬佩你的讀者上七，十一？·</p>
<p>小孩的玩法</p>
<p>｜先把一條</p>
<p>長凳放置地</p>
<p>上。再拿一</p>
<p>條長凳橫跨</p>
<p>在上面。這</p>
<p>樣二個小孩</p>
<p>坐在上面一</p>
<p>張長凳的二端。仿蹺蹺板的玩法。一高一低的玩着。</p>
<p>這是一封「無目的」的無頭信。推想這發信人是純爲畫的感興所迫而寫這封信給我的。在擾擾攘擁的今世，這也可謂一件小小的異聞。</p>
<p>函中有稱議我的畫的話。我把來函在這裹照登了，人將說這像藥房的廣吿：照登某公子玉照或某先生來函，無非是要表明韋廉士大醫生紅色補血丸的靈效。但我也是純爲對於這「窮小孩的玩法」的感興所迫而描這幅畫，寫這篇稿的。無法匿名，也就不顧一切嫌疑了。</p>
<p>我閉了眼睛一看，覺得這位匿名的通信者所發見的，確是我所愛取的畫材。便乘興背摹了一幅。這兩個窮小孩憑子他們的小心的智巧，利用了這現成的材料，造成了這具體而微的運動具。在貧民窟的環境中，這可說是一種十分優異的游戲設備了。我想像這兩個窮小陔各據板凳的一端而一高一低地交互上下的時候，臉上一定充滿了歡笑。因爲他們是無知的幼兒，不曾夢見世間各處運動塲裹專爲兒童置辦的種種優良的幸福的設備，對於這簡陋的游戲已是全沒有知道他老子種出來的米，還糧納租早已用完，輪不着自已吃了。那丢掉了硬蠶豆而嚷着也要火肉粽子的孩子，只知道火肉粽比硬蠶豆好吃；他有得吃，我也要吃；全不知道。他娘做女工賺來的錢買米還不够。那抱住了老子的舖蓋而喊「爸爸買好東西來了」的孩子，只知道爸爸回家總該有好東西帶來；全不知道社會已把他們全家的根一刀宰斷，不久他將變成一張小枯葉了。那抱住了代棉被用的稻草柴當洋囝囝玩的孩子，只覺得今晚眠床裹變的花樣特别新鮮，全不想到這變化的悲哀的原因和苦痛的結果。討飯婆背上的孩子也只是任天而動十分滿足了。這種游戲的簡陋，和這兩個小孩的窮苦，只有我們旁人感到，他們自已是不知道的。</p>
<p>因此我想到了世間窮的小孩的苦。在這社會裹，窮的大人固然苦，窮的小孩更苦！窮的大人苦了，自已能知道其苦，因而能設法免除其苦。窮的小孩苦了，自已不能知道其苦，不能設法免除其苦，一味茫然地追求生的歡喜，這才是天下之至慘！</p>
<p>聞到隔壁人家飯香，禁住了自家的冷竈頭而哭着向娘要白米飯吃。看見鄰家的孩子吃火肉粽子，丢掉了自已手裹的硬蠶豆而嚷着「也要！」老子落脫了飯碗頭回家，孩子抱住！他帶回來的舖蓋而高呌「爸爸買好東西來了！」老棉絮被頭上了當舖，孩子抱住了床裹新添的稻柴東當洋囝囝玩。討飯婆背上的孩子捧着他娘的　子當皮球玩；向着怒駡的不布施者而嚶嚶地笑語。——我們看到了這種苦况而發生同情的時代時，最感觸目傷心的不是窮的大人的苦而是窮的小孩的苦　大人的苦自已知道，同情者只要分擔其平；小孩的苦則自已不知道，全部要歸同情者擔負。那攀住自家的冷縮頭而向娘要白米飯吃的孩子，以爲鍋子裹總應有飯，完地玩耍嘻笑；全不知道他自已的生命托根在這社會所不容的乞丐身上，而正在受人擯斥，看到這種受苦而不知苦的窮的小孩，眞是難以爲情！這好比看見初離襁褓的孩子牽住了尸床上的母親的壽衣而喊「要吃甜奶」，我們的同情之涙，爲死者所流者少，而爲生者所流者多。八指頭陀詠小孩詩云：「駡之惟解笑，打亦不生嗔」。目前的窮人好比都在無辜地受駡挨打：大人們知道被駡被打的苦痛，還能吟呻，呌喊，掙扎，抗抵；小孩們却全不知道，只解嘻笑，絶不生嗔。這不是世間最悽慘的狀態麽？</p>
<p>比較起上述的種種現狀來，我們這匿名的通信者所發見的窮小孩的游戲，還算是幸福的。他們雖然沒有福氣入學校，但幸而不須跟娘去檢煤屑，不須跟爺去捉狗屎，還有游戲的餘暇。他們雖然不得享用運動塲上爲小孩們特製的蹺蹺板，但幸而還有這兩隻板凳，無條件地供他們當作運動具的材料。</p>
<p>只恐日子過下去，不久他們的爺娘要拿這兩條板凳去換米吃，要帶這兩個孩子去檢煤屑，捉狗屎了。到那時，我這位匿名的通信者的所發見，和我的所畫，便成子這兩個窮小孩的黃金時代的夢影。　二十三年七月十四日</p>
<h3>算賬</h3>
<p>— 莫朕</p>
<p>說起淸代的學術來，有幾位學者總是眉飛色舞，說那發逹是爲前代所未有的。證據也眞够十足：解經的大作，層出不窮，小學也非常的進步；史論家雖然絶迹了，考史家却不少：尤其是考據之學，給我們明白了宋明人决沒有看懂的古書·····················</p>
<p>但說起來又有些躊躇，怕英雄也許會因此指定我是猶太人，其實，並不是的。我每遇到學者談起淸代的學術時，總不免同時想：「揚州十日」，「嘉定三屠」這些小事情，不提也好罷，但失去全國的土地，大家十足做了二百五十年奴隸，却換得這幾頁光榮的學術史，這買賣，究竟是賺了利，還是折了本呢？</p>
<p>可惜我又不是數學家，到底沒有弄淸楚。但我直覺的感到，這恐怕是折了本，比用庚子賠欵來養成幾位有限的學者，虧累得多了。</p>
<p>但恐怕這又不過是俗見。學者的見解，是超然於得失之外的。雖然超然於得失之外，利害大小之辨却又似乎並非全沒有。大莫大於尊孔，要莫要於崇儒，所以只要尊孔而崇儒，便不妨向任何新朝俯首。對新朝的說法，就呌作「反過來征服中國民族的心」。</p>
<p>而這中國民族的有些心，眞也被征服得澈底，到現在，還在用兵燹癘疫，水旱，風蝗，换取着孔廟重修，雷峰塔再建，男女同行犯忌，四庫珍本發行這些大門面。</p>
<p>我也並非不知道災害不過暫時，如果沒有記錄，到明年就會大家不提起，然而光榮的事業却是永久的。但是，不知怎地，我雖然並非猶太人，却總有些喜歡講損益，想大家來算一算向來沒有人提起過的這一筆賬。｜｜而且，現在也正是這時候了。</p>
<h3>夏天的旅行（續完）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>也許就因爲是夏天吧，在海邊上，很容易回憶起了南國，從前我所到過的那些殖民地的國家。</p>
<p>雖然在這兒並沒有看見椰子和芒果的樹蔭，但望着了精雅的洋式飯店，和店前草地上啜飲咖啡的白人，就好像我已回到了星加坡的海濱公園和仰光的綠綺湖畔一樣。</p>
<p>心裹起着這樣不快的感覺：難道我們的國家，竟同缅甸爪哇一般的麽？</p>
<p>然而，實際上，倘若這時拭着額上的汗，在綠綺湖畔散步，或是海濱公園閒坐，我相信，一定是要更爲愉快些。因爲，至少不會在綠蔭蓬草之間，看見了殘缺的牆，和一片亂瓦，那些已往的戰事痕跡甚麽時候才是最愉快的夏天旅行呢？</p>
<p>我想：應該是一切人都能作一次夏天旅行的時候</p>
<h3>關於玩物喪志</h3>
<p>— 敦龐</p>
<p>淸代文壇掌故雜錄之一</p>
<p>顧亭林嘗勗其甥徐立齋相國曰：「有體國經野之心，而後可以登山臨水：有濟世安民之略，而後可以考古論今。」</p>
<p>按：林語堂說：「余嘗謂玩物喪志，係今世僞道學襲古昔眞道學語。今人謂遊名山，讀古書，寫小品，便是玩物喪志。然德人喜登名山，法人好讀古書，英人亦長小品，而三國人之志並未喪，並不勇於私鬥，怯於公憤，如吾同胞。然則國人之志本薄弱可知，喪之不足惜，不喪亦亡能爲也。」（見人間世第七期）據此以論，顧亭林不知是「今世僞道學」之流，抑是「古昔眞道學」之流？但是他至少有一部「郡國利病書」。不必說他曾帶過兵了。德人登名山，法人讀古書，英人長小品的，固然可以相信是事實，但是他們是否把這些當作「正經」，每天如此，那可不得而知了。至於「吾同胞」呢，志本薄弱，一不喪亦亡能爲」，所以不妨設法使喪盡，蓋一喪之不足惜也」。</p>

<p>關照孩子們，「當心</p>

<p>險，手不可伸過去。</p>
<p>細嫩的手指被軋了一</p>
<p>下，不是要處。</p>
<h3>我來自東（五）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>你到芝加哥南部的幾條大街上一看，你會驚奇這世界第三的都市，會是這樣的破碎不堪的。在有些意大利人聚居着的區域裹面，男女老小，擠在又小又髒的房子裹，過着非人類的生活。在那邊暗殺淫亂，已成習慣。在那邊沒有所謂道德禮義廉恥。有錢的階級，大槪都住到城外去了，夜中留在城内的，除開小舗子以外，往往是貧民，乞丐，流氓，妓女，以及外國來的移民。</p>
<p>去年我國爲受不了芝加哥的吵閙，所以特别逃到美范溪Ｍｉｌｗａｕｋｅｅ城去休息幾天。這次再見了芝加哥，便恨不得早點擺脫。在車站中待車，看了一份報，幸而向西開行的汽車，已停在站口，我便急忙忙的換了車票，離開這個可詛咒的城市而再登我西行的路程。</p>
<p>渡落機山</p>
<p>美國西部，從美西瀉碧河以西數百哩開始，直到靠近太平洋岸的落機山脈爲止，原來是一片大荒野。現在這個區域，大半已經栽耘着小麥，但是西邊一部分依舊是黃沙漠漠，赤土千里的狀况。汽車路被灰塵掩積着，路邊沒有一點流水；只有長着荆棘的矮樹，伏在黃色的荒原上，飽受着風沙的摧折。此處居民稀少，汽車經過的市鎭，往往僅有幾份人家。房子是矮矮的，便有幾片農田，也是着力灌漑的結果。</p>
<p>在這茫茫的原野上，你可以想像到美國草萊初闢時一幅圖畫。在一二百、年以前，這裹還是紅色的印第安人統治着的世界。他們騎着高頭大馬，用烏羽製成的帽見，披在額後。腰上緊緊的束着紅帶，兩腿挾着馬肚，像飛鳥一樣的輕輕快快的跑。當王蜀黍長滿了田野的秋天，他們便會燒起野火，男男女女，圍着猛烈的火狂舞。他們穿着鹿皮的鞋兒，他們拜着刻有鳥獸形狀的圖騰柱。他們的生活，是耕耘，打獵，和戰爭。在白人未到之前，紅人的各族，互相殺戮。他們將殺下的人頭，做自已榮譽的記錄。人頭殺得太多了，他們會用種種方法，把人頭縮小得像茶杯一樣大小。據說這種縮小人頭的方法，近世的科學家也研究不出其所以然來。三四百年以前，歐洲的白人，渡過大西洋，從東部和南部侵入，紅人們除了對付各族間的戰爭以外，又要和白人厮殺。他們的勇敢和他們的善戰，是美國以津津樂道的；他們的俠義，他們的慷慨，也是現在的美國人萬不能及。然而在短短的三四百年期間，這些原來美洲的主人，已漸成博物院的材料了。</p>
<p>但是紅印第安人的勇敢善戰和他們對白人的抵抗和屠殺，間接的使美國民族得到一種新生力，新精神。歐洲民族向北美發展，愈向西走，所遇的抵抗力愈大，而爲克復這種抵抗力，在美洲的白人所養成戰勝環境的能力亦愈大。當開邊的先驅者如Ｂｏｏｎｅ等，划着用樹幹繫成的獨木舟，循着美西瀉碧河的支流上去。兩岸鬼森森的是有毒的森森，印第安人的毒箭和石子，時時向他們發碧。他們在重重壓迫中掙　着。他們一年到頭沒有所謂安定和享受的生活。在用粗木編成的小屋裹，他們沒有火爐，更沒有地毯。婦女也只得學會種田，小孩子也只得學會打槍。他們眷着長長的鬍子，在半沙漠質的地帶上，和半開化的紅印第安人爭着生存。血和死點級着他們日常的生活，馬和槍，是他們生命的依託。他們爲消滅野蠻的異族，他們也染來蠻族的勇敢好戰的氣質，而這種氣質，乃是美國民族所以有眞實的成功的一個主要條件。尤其是這一帶的美國人，現在還保持着紅白二族戰爭時代的習慣和風氣。</p>

<h3>診金標準規定之意義</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>上海市衛生局數年前曾有醫師診金最高限度之規定，當時以不合規定原則，致爲醫界所反對，嗣鄙人於本市醫師公會提議自訂，舉凡内外各科各項手術，悉列其最低之診費，以適應一般普通人士。歷時時數載，參合廿餘專家之意見，而後有標準規定之實現，惟其意義，似尙爲少數同道所懹疑，爰加簡單說明以爲解答。</p>
<p>（一）對於一般病人病家對於診金，每誤認爲生命健康之代價，故往往視結果吉凶而異其高下，甚至有任意折扣或靳而不與者，若醫師稍事催索，卽爲誣吿之動機，年來醫家病家之對簿公庭，罔不以吝付珍金爲嚆矢，甚可慨也，今本規定原則内卽明白揭示此義，使病家知診金之付與，爲其應盡之責任，數目之多寡，自有標準之可依，然則前此之誤會，不皆可永釋於無形乎？</p>
<p>（二）對於新開業同道新開業同道！對於繁重手術診費，每苦無標準可依，而有過高或過低之感，今若示以本標準之規定，或亦可資參考，但如病者確係貧苦，收費不妨稍低，如手術確係繁難，診費亦可高漲，斟酌而行之，自無過與不及之弊矣。</p>
<p>（三）對於國内之江湖醫生診金者，學術之報酬，名譽之保險費也，蓋醫學爲高深之科學，非有深邃之研究不能出而問世，故必高其價値，以稍償其求學時代之勤勞，及至歷時旣久，聲譽漸高，而診金規定，亦必隨之而高漲，乃有其名譽之保險費耳！蓋名譽非一朝一夕之所能得，而治病之際，一處方一手術之間，皆有毁墮其名譽之可能，以區區金錢之報酬而易其歷年掙得之名譽，果熟重而孰輕乎？今乃有江湖之醫，假口解决貧病，模仿商界行爲，大减其價，以廣招徠，蓋以診金本無標準，故易售其奸，今旣加以規定，則其低價自當有所限制，而一般病人亦不致墮其術中矣。</p>
<p>（四）對於外籍之江湖醫生醫師雖有高訂診例之自由，而外籍之江湖醫生則利用華人拜外心理其所訂診例之高，往往出人意表，蓋不如此不足以飽其經濟侵略之野心也，至社會人士，則向以診金無一定之標準，故雖覺其高，而亦無如之何，今若示以本會之標準規定，吾知其必將咋舌而驚，廢然而返也。</p>
<p>附錄診金標凖規定原則</p>
<p>（一）凡屬本會會員俱有接受診金之權</p>
<p>（二）本會會員於正當診金外不得接受一切不義之財</p>
<p>（三）本會視目下本市之生活程度情形應一般普通人士之需要製訂下列之診金最低率以爲標凖規定</p>
<p>（四）本會會員不得製訂診例低出於規定最低限度之下而爲非道義之競爭但以工作繁簡之不同得製訂診例高出於規定限度以上</p>
<p>（五）普通診察外有需理化上或特别器械之檢查當酌量加費</p>
<p>（六）會診費當較常診費爲高專科醫師費得較普通醫師費爲高</p>
<p>（七）本會會員對於無力病人得酌量减收診金赤貧病人應免費施診</p>
<p>（八）同道及其妻室與未成年之兒女就診者無診金服務之護士就診者亦無診金</p>
<p>（九）病情千變萬化「包醫」在禁例之條</p>
<p>（十）醫業非商業可比醫病雙方不當較重錙銖診金與工資不同病家報酬不視結果吉凶而異議診金一律付現至多月杪結算不得强制尅扣</p>
<h3>不孕的原因</h3>
<p>— 吳曼靑</p>
<p>「不孝有三，無後爲大」。我國人自古來就看重後嗣。我可以大膽的說一句：「中國家庭的悲劇，一大半都是因爲不孕的關係。」因爲我們中國人普遍的觀念，以爲一對夫婦結婚後多年沒有生育，一定是做妻的不能生育。因此「不育的女人」便被輕視，欺侮，甚而至於不能在家庭立足。唉！「不孕」！你是一個使許多中國女子多麽傷心的名詞呵！</p>
<p>我們做婦科醫師的人，天天會遇着許多可憐的女子來求問不孕的診療法。我們當然爲她們詳細診察及解釋。但是我想那些担着「不孕」惡名的不幸女子還多着呢，因此做了這篇「不孕的原因」，使大家明白了解。</p>
<p>我們要曉得，「成孕」是精虫和卵子的結舍，是男女雙方的生殖種子的結合。所以男女任何一方面的生殖能力如果不健全，便不能成孕。我們遇見一對結婚多年還沒有生育的夫婦，千萬不能歸罪於一方，必須診察雙方的身體，方可獲得正當的解答。譬如一個男子吧，他生成就是天閹，怎麽可以呌他的妻生育呢？又如一個生過白濁性副睪丸炎的男子，怎麽可以責備他的妻不能生育呢？其他如患梅毒，糖屎病脊髓勞，腎臓炎或吸食大量雅片的男子，都可以搆成不孕的原因。關於男子方面不孕的原因，恕我在此簡略。好在我不過是要大家曉得一對夫妻無生育，不一定完全是妻的責任罷了。</p>
<p>至於女子方面呢，那不孕的原因也很多，有些女子天生成沒有陰道，或則陰道閉塞一端。這當然沒有生育（俗名石女）。不過，不要把處女膜厚的女子當作不孕的女子。因爲處女膜厚的女子雖則不能和男子性交，但是遺洩在處女膜外的精虫還可以從很小的孔道中穿入子宮内而成孕。有些女子的子宮口天然閉塞，這當然也不能生育。又有些女子，她的生殖器官發育不完全，或則曾經患過子宫内膜炎，或則子宮位置倒後，或則喇叭管曾經發炎而閉塞，或則卿巢曾經發炎，或則曾經患過局部腹膜炎，這些都是可以成爲不孕的原因。此外如患梅毒，糖尿病，腎臓炎，肥胖病，内分泌障碍症，結核性喇叭管炎等症，都可使她不孕。</p>
<p>最可憐的就是女子患白濁病了。大多數的女子患白濁都是她的男人傳染的。起初她不曉得。不過覺得白帶多些罷了。後來白濁函逐漸向上蔓延，走入子宮腔内，喇叭管内，腹腔内，因此發生子宮内膜炎，喇叭管炎，或局部腹膜炎，結果嗽叭管因結蒂組織的增生而愈着，便成爲眞正不孕的喇叭管閉塞症。我們曉得，别的病菌也可以使剌叭管發炎及腹膜局部發炎，可是多少終有痊愈的希望。至於患過白濁性喇叭管閉塞症的女子呢，今生大約沒有生育的希望了。在這許多不孕的女子當中，白濁是件最大的原因，這是多麽可憐的事呵！</p>
<p>至於不孕症的治法，那要從牠的原因方面着手了。因爲牠的原因很多，所以治法也沒有一定。有的要用手術，有的要用喇叭管通氣法，有的要用藥物，有的要用電氣，有的簡直沒有辦法。好在找着一般正式的專門醫師一定可以獲得相當的療治或解釋。至於那些種子金丹一類的東西呢，我勸大家不要受骗吧。</p>
<h3>助產學校的修業年限應否統一？</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>約莫半月以前，我在「投考助產學校的資格問題」的標題之下，對於中央助產學校所規定的入學資格，曾發表了一點意見。因爲我感覺到中央助產學校的當局，對於這投考資格的限制，官氣太重，不合情理，我就不很客氣地批評了幾句。其中的大意是這樣：第一點，對於學歷的規定：須具有高中畢業或曾在高中肄業二年以上者；我說不必！初中畢業，已經足够。第二點，對於投考者年齡的規定：須在二十二歲以上，三十歲以下；我說他這「二十二歲以上」的一語，没有道理。第三點，規定須要「未婚女子，」我也以爲入學校學習助產，並非進修道院受戒，也用不着只許未婚女子入學，不準已婚女子投考的蠻加限制。</p>
<p>最近的幾天中，又在報紙的敎育欄中，看見過敎育部對於助產學校的修業年限問題，下了一個通令。那一種的報紙，那一天的日脚，我都找不着，忘記了；只是他主要意思，却還記得很淸楚：（一）初級中學畢業進入助產學校，其修業年限，定爲三年，（二）高級小學畢業，進了助產學校，他的修業年限，須得五年。</p>
<p>就是對於這初中畢業，定爲三年，高小畢業，須要五年的二點，我要來在這裹，寫出一點兒意見。</p>
<p>這兒尙有一點聲明：就是爲什麽我要把以前對於中央助産學校的投考資格的意見，節述在本文的開端上呢？這是有個原因：因爲這一次敎育部對於助產學校所規定的修業年限的通令，與中央助產學校的投考資格，彷彿含有一起一伏的「神氣，」帶着首尾相應的味兒。這「一起一伏」「首尾相應」的一條綫索，我們把他倆來相互聨繫的平舖開來，便很明白：中央助產學校的入學資格，規定是高中畢業或曾在高中肄業二年以上者，而修業年限，據說是二年；新近敎育部對於這助產學校的入學資格與修業年限，明文規定的是：初中畢業者定爲三年，高小畢業的，則需五年。中央助產學校的入學資格與修業年限，是否打過敎育部的照呼以後，才來規定，我們不得而知，正如這次敎育部所規定出來的三年五年的修業年限，是否出於敎育部當局自家的主意，抑由於什麽人代爲規訂出來，我們局外人是毌從知道的一樣；然而敎育部對於他的入學資格與修業年限的規定，事實上，恐怕已經默認，不會有何異義了吧。就是這樣，我們很明白了：中國目下的助產敎育，已形成三種形態的三級制了：　以入學資格的</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>不同，而分定修業年限的長短的三個學制。譬如中央助產學校的修業年限定爲二年；爲什麽呢？因爲他的入學資格是「高中畢業。」敎育部便似乎代爲推之：初中畢業者三年，高小畢業的需要五年。</p>
<h3>學科敎授的衛生和兒童體格檢查（下）程</h3>
<p>— 瀚章</p>
<p>（Ｂ）須要監察的兒童應當繼續監察體格檢查的結果，在身體有異常者之中，要繼續發見須要監察的兒童。對於這些兒童，其監察的要點和方法，須和校醫互相會議，務請校醫和敎師恊力加以視察。須要監察的疾病種類和程度，可由校醫决定。但大要如下：</p>
<p>（ａ）患傳染病者，未行適當的預防處置而上校者。</p>
<p>（ｂ）發育不良，營養不足，體格薄弱者。</p>
<p>（ｃ）貧血，腺病，脚氣者。</p>
<p>（ｄ）眼光度異常，弱視，聽力障礙，中耳炎，咽喉症患者。</p>
<p>（ｅ）神經系的異常，精神薄弱者。</p>
<p>（ｆ）慢性支氣管疾病，喘息，肋膜之恢復期，心臓衰弱，心疾患者。</p>
<p>（ｇ）關節疾患，胸廓異常，高度脊柱彎曲。</p>
<p>（ｈ）腎臓炎的恢復期，脫腸。</p>
<p>（ｉ）在普通病後恢復期中者。</p>
<p>（ｃ）身體虚弱者的養護前面講的須要監察的兒童中，包括病弱者和身體虚弱者在内，那是都要繼續監察的，對於身體的虚弱者，尤其要和家庭聨絡；在學校中必須有衛生的養護設備。這種虚弱者要和病弱者相區别，而加充分注意於日常敎授衛生和體育運動。注意减輕他們的擔負，勿使起過勞。更利用長期休假的機會，使他們行休假集會，或另設一級休閑學級。</p>
<p>兒童被收容於這樣設備中的，最適當的是體格薄弱者，營養不足者，發育不良者，異常體格和腺病者，呼吸器和消化器罹有病患者，皮膚抵抗力薄弱者，病後衰弱者等。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）對於疾病缺點者的處置凡患有傳染病的兒童，應當照學校傳染病規程處置。患有他種疾病和缺點的，應該把治療或矯正的方法勸吿其家長或本人。對於視力聽力的障礙者，日常在學校内注意使他們坐在便於學習的座位。對於脊柱彎曲，胸廓異常，扁平足，字形腿，Ｘ字形腿等姿勢異常的，都要設法矯正。對於内臓的慢性病者，要减輕一部學科的擔負。</p>
<p>（丑）統計的觀察</p>
<p>學校方面應該把兒童們的發育，營養，疾病的種類，和其他必要的種種項目，統計分類起來，分别年齡和男女。那就可以大體的明瞭該校學童的健康狀態了。又逐年把這些統計分類起來，可以觀察學校衛生的儣步程度，是很有興趣的。同時又能把他們利用而改進兒童的健康，對於國家民族的前途，是何等重大啊！</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（十）（三）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>此種乾酷性物質，除石灰性硬化爲良好之現象外，大多數是日趨於軟化的。結果因腐敗而液體化，像糜粥一樣的，或且是乳白色的破碎物質。這種物質，在肺結核患者中，係和痰唾一同向外面排出的，結果病灶中部也就成空隙了，所謂空洞是。在别的器官方面，結果也會構成瘦管或潰瘍的。此空洞的大小是不一的，小的不過像一顆豌豆似的，也可以有手拳一樣大小的。空洞的内壁，同時也分泌多量膿液，這一種情形，是和結核菌的發育狠有利益的。另外的微生物，像連鎖球菌葡萄球菌等，也可以隨吸氣而入肺部；結果也會佔據空洞，和結核菌狼狽爲奸的，這就是普通所謂的混合傳染了。他是可使病人熱度增高的。</p>
<p>結核病人到了一發生空洞的時候，他的病灶，已不像從前周圍給炎性和健體組織包圍的光景了；他的軟化的乾酪性物質，係可以向外面排出的，結果結核桿菌也在痰唾裹面發現了，病人的痰唾也有傳染的危險了。在這種時際，醫學上給他一個特殊名詞，呌做：「開放性結核」。如果病灶還是給健體組織包圍着的，痰唾裹面是檢不出結核菌的，我們另外給他一個名字，呌做：「閉鎖性結核」。這二個名詞的分類，在臨床上是界限狠淸的：其實歸根到底，完全係本諸病理解剖的變化而言的。讀者們看了上面的叙述，當然不患不明白了。。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識（續）</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（七）夏天爲什麽也會傷風</p>
<p>本題所講的傷風。是指普通鼻感冒（Ｓｃｈｕｕｐｔｅｕ　Ｃｏｒｙｚａ）而言。在醫學上，又稱急性鼻粘膜炎（Ｒｈｉｕｉｔｉｓ　ａｃｎｕｔｌａ）。並非指從　Ｐｌｅｉｆｆｅｒ　氏病原菌傳染而來俗稱重傷風的流行性感冒（ｌｎｆｌｕｅｕｚａ　Ｇｒｉｐｐｅ）。這種傷風的危險。是比流行性感冒來得少。也不容易轉到肺炎。生了這種傷風的人。大槪也用不着什麽一種「「出賣重傷風一見就成功」」迷信的愚笨行爲。他是不是一種傳染病。我雖不敢斷定。但是看了一衆當中先後相繼發病的事實。到也只好承認他是有傳染性質的。他的病原體雖有好幾種細菌都有發病的能力。但是究竟那一種。現在還沒有確定呢。這種傷風發生最多的時季。和流行性感冒一樣。也是在春秋冬三季。不過在夏天發生的。也不在少數。繁華城市的居民（像上海）。比較鄉村裹的居民。更容易發生。這是什麽緣故呢。待我來說一說明白罷。</p>
<p>這種傷風在醫學上，旣然呌做鼻感冒和急性鼻粘膜炎。當然知道他的病變部位。是在鼻腔粘膜上。我們鼻腔的粘膜。在解剖學上，分作兩部。占大部的，稱爲呼吸部。占小部的，稱爲嗅部。嗅部的粘膜。是狠菲薄的。顏色是呈黃色。含有嗅細胞。呼吸部的粘膜。是比較厚一點。顏色是呈赤色。富有粘液腺（分泌粘液）和重層氈毛圓柱上皮細胞。在下甲介（左右鼻腔，各有三個甲介，卽上中下，由外面觀察，只見兩個甲介，因上甲介位置深高，故不易見），同中甲介的粘膜。特别疏鬆柔軟。這是因爲有海綿樣靜脈，平滑筋，彈力纖維，海綿體等的關係。所以這一部粘膜如是遇着氣溫的變化，器械的刺戟，化學的刺戟，塵埃的侵入，精神的影響等，都能引超特别反射的變化，而陷入炎症的病態。夏天最容易感染傷風的原因。就是因爲遇着氣溫變化的機會過多的緣故。我現在把幾椿顯而易見的事實來證明一下。</p>
<p>一，夏天的氣候。大都日熱夜凉。一般素來閉窗合門睡眠的人。因贪一時的爽快安眠起見。大開窗門。因此受寒而傷風。</p>
<p>二，幾家時髦摩登的電影院。到了夏天。因求觀衆快樂起見。裝置冷氣管。進院的時候。驟然一冷。出院的時候。驟然一熱。忽冷忽熱。是人工的受寒。一般體質薄弱缺乏抵抗的觀衆。最易傷風。（未完）</p>
<h3>談醫</h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>醫之目的，大言之，在於健全民族，小言之，在於治療疾病，實則卽以種種方法，延長人類之生命而已，凡百生物，莫不欲維持其生命，蓋無生命，則冥頑不靈，無從活動，而醫者卽維持人類生命之使者，故其執業之重要與高尙，在百業中當首屈一指，先進各國，推崇醫者備至，凡醫者之言，莫不視爲金科玉律，服從勿諼，以視我國列醫於巫卜之林，誠不可以道里計，專制時代，凡貴族患病，醫者爲其診治之時，例須跪拜後方施診察，深閨少艾，不許醫者見面，致有隔幕摸索而診者，病如不起，不問責任何屬，卽繩醫者以重法，其蔑視醫者之地位，誠堪髮指，推其蔑視之原因，雖爲一般人未能明瞭醫之眞諦，而醫之品類龐雜，亦爲蔑視原因之一，所謂讀書不成，學賈不成則學醫者，到處皆是，其間固不乏通儒碩士，研究醫學，獨具心得，爲世人所欽崇者，然甚鮮矣，民國肇興，凡百更始，醫業之重要，漸爲人民所了解，學醫者亦漸能自愛，新醫且皆由學校出身，此不能不謂爲醫業前途之曙光，然以敎育未普及之故，醫之地位，雖見提高，而大部分人民之無醫學知識，依然如故，邇來醫者與病家往往因不可挽救之病，發生糾紛，以至涉訟法庭，歷久不决者，比比皆然，卽人民無醫學知識之表現也。夫如肺癆之末期，癌腫已呈惡液質時，方始乞治於醫，迨藥石無靈，回生乏術，不自咎乞治之晚，反咎醫者之隕越，醫者無辜，而蒙此不白之寃，不平孰甚？現代醫學，雖有長足進步，然有多種疾病，不但未能根本治療，卽其發生之眞因，亦尙在研究之中，故不幸病患不治，醫者只能本其能力及醫德，力加施治，决不能擔保起死人而肉白骨也，世有以醫者不能治病，僅在一定限度之内，預防疾病，藥物不能愈病，僅能輔助自然之力，早日去病，斯言也，眞能了解醫之眞諦者矣。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我　　　　那些至戚都是窮得不可開交，讀者也許不能相信吧？但事實的確如此！而且他們之所以窮，還是太后給他們促成的！我常常懹疑伊是故意想出這些特别的方法來捉弄他們的：因爲每隔不多時候伊總要揀幾樣東西去送給伊的親戚，這些東西，往往又是但重裝璜，不合實用的；再加每次總是裝在絶大絶大的盒子或箱子裹，鄭重其事的送出去。他的親戚見了，雖是暗暗在呌苦，表面上却總得歡歡喜喜的接受下來，還要望闕謝恩，表示非常感激的意思。事實上他們正像見了討債的人一般尶𡯓。因爲每逢太后或皇上賜什麽東西給臣下的時候，臣下就得依着規矩，開發賞錢給那些扛抬來，或跟隨來的太監；這種賞錢，並且還是有訂定的數目的，不像尋常人家餽贈，總依禮物的價値而定賞的多少。他們是依着太監的等級而别的：每一個三等或四等太監，就得一律開發紋銀二十兩；較次的每名十兩；經不起各來三名，便非九十兩不辦了，何况每次太后有東西賜出去的時候，那些閑着沒事幹的太監，總歡喜一窠蜂似的跟隨着那幾個眞正被派去磅東西的人，一起前去，這樣他們也就可以同樣的得到賞錢了；至於受太后賞賜的人能不能担負這樣巨額的賞錢，他們是不問的！偏是太后不斷的愛把那些不相干的東西去賞給伊的親戚，因爲伊賞得實在太殷勤了，以致於伊的親戚，竟將所有的錢，全孝敬了那些太監：後來竟至無法開銷。那可不行啊，太監們是非拿到力錢不肯走的！於是他們只得用一個窮法子來抵擋，便是每逢太監們賚着東西來了之後，先由一個人或一部份人送茶送湯的把他們欵留住，｜｜那些太監也决不嚷着要走，都很高興地坐下來，天南地北的瞎談，因爲他們早已明白這中間的緣故了。（八八）</p>
<h3>我所見的博士</h3>
<p>— 翼之</p>
<p>故鄉雖然連續地給兵匪鬧了個七八年，但文化却不曾因地方經濟的衰落而退步；兩三年功夫卽可在國内得個把學士銜的撇開，就是吃過洋麫包而且討過洋奶奶回來的博士也有了，這不能不引爲榮幸的！</p>
<p>博士，在上海固然是「撒尿都可碰到」，但在渺小的故鄉，出了這麽一個，洋狀元」還是要另眼看他的；所以，當博士由法國回到上海來，第一次見面，便使我在腦際裏刻下了個很深的印象；其實，矮小，駝背，眼鏡，保險刀，是他使我容易識别他的一個很好的標誌。</p>
<p>自然，成敗是不足論英雄的，像博士從前典賣爹媽和妻子的血食，跑到里昻做着給人家揩地板扇爐子的工讀生那種力求上進的精神，已是不可多得；回到本國來，已經兩年，沒有稱心的肥差使給他幹，讓他度着這悠長的窮歲月，有時，向人家「挨點血」事實上也是無可責備的雖然他是法學博士，懂得「詐欺取財」這條法律，至於遊戲塲「趕野鷄」，携着毛姑娘進兩角錢的電影院，那是「英雄」托足無門的窮極無聊的消遣，又有什麽希奇｜</p>
<p>「畢業卽失業」博士也有供過於求的趨勢；想起博士府上的老幼當年節衣縮食給他讀書和現在的忍飢挨餓，與博士自已當年過着工讀的苦生涯和現在的窮途落魄，而且洋老婆撇了他而回法國去的慘狀，眞不禁替博士扼腕，更不禁爲博士的府上長太息｜我所見的博士是這樣，不知還有同樣的第二個沒有？</p>
<h3>我所見的小販</h3>
<p>— 季誠性</p>
<p>在許多小販中被我所注意的，要算那個老者了。</p>
<p>去年暑假某個晚上。我與同學王君在博覽橋上納凉，偶然碰見一個小販，我們由生意經上談到老者家中的經濟狀况，起初他無心接談，卒因我們的談話極端體諒生活於下層社會的人們，顯然的，他的心被我們的誠懇態度所感動了！</p>
<p>我停住紙扇的揮動，靜聽他的言說：「先生，我們做這生意已有二十多年了。近來生意一天淸淡一天。每日積蓄是微乎其微的。有時候還要折本呢。我的家在淸波門附近：我有兩個兒子，大的於十年前到南洋去，到現在連信息也沒有，我自已想積蓄點錢，預備送小兒上學去。不幸事情出乎意外，上月大兒忽然回來了。他把家中的情形忘記得乾　乾凈凈了，連我的名字也記不像了。他是我的兒子嗎？我不禁驚異起來。他的口音，他的說話，他的外表，啊啊，都變了！幸虧我記起了他的右眼上有一顆痣。眞的，一點也沒有錯。他穿着很好的皮鞋，西裝，頭上戴着很美麗的草帽······他預備重往南洋行商去，現在向我借三十塊錢做資本，他說不久就可發財的，那時再呌我享點現成福，我聽了他的話又氣又惱。在外十多年，不但不帶的話又氣又惱。在外十多年，不但不帶一文錢回家，啊！然而我只得忍着痛把平日慘淡經營起來的錢全數交給他了。唉，小兒的上學費呢？自已的防老金呢？一切都被他剥奪了，剥奪了！」</p>
<p>這時他的眼涙快要跳出眼眶了！那擔黃金瓜還滿滿地向行人乞憐。我掏出兩毛小洋擲到他的籃裹，連頭也不顧一下就走開了。</p>
<p>如今又是溽暑迫人的夏天了。可是博覽橋上的小販中，再也找不到那個可憐的老者了！</p>

<p>江氏笑道：我想咱們自强，官也别升的特大了，作個團長就罷啦，别當什麽總司令了。我想他幹到那樣大的事，也許娶個三房四房的，沒事家裹閙得天翻地覆，那也無味。桂枝笑道：我想他就是作了大官，也不至於閙到這種樣子的。爲了回來晚了一點，就在家裹唱半會陪姨太太的禮。我想這姨太太準是天婆國色，要不然，這位師長，也不能够這樣的喜歡他，有機會，我倒要瞧瞧他。江氏道：有道是，三分人才，七分打扮，有幾個美女，是天生出來好看的，也不過穿的好戴的好罷啦。桂枝雖然覺得母親所說，很有幾分理由，不過自已心裹總還存着這個念頭，旣然那師長這樣寵愛他，一定有緣由的。當他心裹橫下了這樣一種想頭時，進進出出，對那重洋樓總不免要看看。那樓上不是嘻嘻哈哈笑着，就有人唱皮簧，整天不閑，眞是高興，就在這晚上那樓上燈火辉煌的窗户裹面，叮叮咚咚，打着鋼琴，有那溜尖的女人嗓子，在那裹唱着。他心裹想着，這必然是那姨太太在唱。唱得像畫眉烏一樣呌，這也就難怪那師長寵愛他的了。不過這樣一來。桂枝要看這姨太太的心事，又加濃厚了一層。由趙翁口裹傳了出去，便是前面店房裹糧食行裹的人，也完全知道了。又過一天，桂枝正打扮了一番，依着公公的話，要到產科醫院去檢查身體。前面糧食店裹一個小徒弟飛也似的跑了進來，呌道：趙太太快出去瞧罷。對門那個全師長的姨太太可就要出來啦。他的汽車停在大門外哩。桂枝究竟邏脫不了那番孩子氣，匆匆的就走了出來。江氏在後面，還只呌留心脚下，别摔了（四三九）</p>
<h3>我所見的鱉寳汪瘦秋</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>大槪是上個月吧？淸江浦曾發生一件奇聞，是在巨鱉的腹中，發現一個小人，事實是這樣的：淸江浦河北十里長街地方，有一家飯館，在前月的某一天，因爲要作一樣菜，就購得一只重約四斤的巨鱉，那知道剖開來的時候，竟在裹面發現一個長約一寸多的小人，有口；有鼻；有耳；有目；簡直和人是一樣的，不過因爲先煮的，所以這小人已經是死的了！據一般的人說：這小人呌做鱉寳，是鱉的精華，如果放在人體裹，則地下的各種寳物，就完全可以看見了。不過它是以血爲生，須要和它講好，每日祇能吃多少血，否則一定把你吃的面黃肌瘦，死亡大吉了！這種怪誔的傳說，當然是不可置信。我記得聊齋誌異，和閱微草堂筆記上，都有過關於鱉寳的記載，我當時以爲是傳說乏詞，那知竟實有其事，天下的事眞是不可思議了！</p>
<p>鱉有鱉寳；狗有狗寳；牛有牛寳；馬有馬寳；價値都是很貴的，尤其是鱉寳，簡直是無價之寳。然而萬物之靈的人們，倒沒聽見說有人寳，如果人要是有人寳，其價値一定會超過狗，牛，馬等寳，大可以作一筆外國生意呢！但是人竟沒有寳出現過，我不得不說一句人不如鱉，也不如牛，狗，馬了！嗚呼！</p>

<h3>老上海的藏書家</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>上海通社現在的上海，是全國文化的中心地，出版家都集聚在此間，收藏家也多於過江之卿。古代的上海，和出版家是沒有緣份的而藏書家則比之當時的臨安與姑蘇，却未見得讓步很遠。這也許是可以供給本地的圖書館參考的，所以我們來談談老上海的藏書家。</p>
<p>可考的第一個上海藏書家，該是莊肅。他是宋末人，曾經做過秘書院的小史。當時的秘書院就是國立京都圖書館，小史就是典藏員，由於這種職務，我們能够斷定他的性情是愛書的。宋亡後，他棄官歸隱，住在靑龍鎭。（其地在新江鄉四十五保，縣治之西，吳淞江之南。明代把其地劃歸靑浦縣）私家收書至八萬卷，這也眞很厲害了。陶宗儀的輟耕錄說：「江南藏書家多者止三家，莊其一也。」又可見當時莊氏藏書的威名。到了元至正年間，政府因修宋遼金三史，特派學士危素到他的家裹徵集圖書。那裹知道他的子孫不中用，恐怕政府是來查禁書的，就此放一把野火，糟糕十八萬卷圖書都被六甲拿去了。</p>
<p>杜元芳，字玉泉，宋祁國公衍九世孫。時代較莊肅略晚一些。嘗做德淸縣主簿。老年退隱杜村，（在靑龍鎭西南，白鶴江畔）構翡翠碧雲樓，庋藏圖書萬卷。</p>
<p>到了明代，上海的藏書家就更多了，我們現在祇提出幾位和學術界發生過重要關係的來說。</p>
<p>陶宗儀的說郛，不是一部很偉大的古代說部叢書嗎？其中搜羅的小種零件，多數是現在沒有别處可以找了。這部說郛最初的刋行，是郁文博的力量。郁是上海人，家有萬卷樓，藏書甚富。他刋印說郛，着實費了許多精神去替它校勘，七十九歲的老人了，還是丹鉛不去乎。但是我們從旁面看，可以知道他自然是有了豐富的藏書，才能够把内容博大的說郛來校訂。</p>
<p>郁文博目賦詩云：「白頭林下」耆儒，終歲樓間校說郛：目力心思俱竭盡，不知有益後人無？」你看，他不是風趣得很嗎！</p>
<p>陸深是明代的名宦，藏書極多，开且很著名。所以這裹不多說他，而要說他的朋友黃標。黃標不祇是能够取書，而且善於讀書。繙閱經史，無間寒暑，對於各種書籍的内容都很熟悉。陸深做文章有疑義時，總是請黃標來考訂。陸深的兒子陸楫，嘗輯古今說海，是一部極著名的古小說選本，書凡一百四十二卷，其底本向黃標借的竟有三十卷之多。陸氏兩代藏書，應該是很可觀了，但是孤本秘笈，還酿讀黃標多呢。陸楫輯說海時，又屬黃標爲總校勘。</p>
<p>黃標藏書的下落是很令人悲憤的！就是在倭寇犯上海時，他的書籍都被燬光了。</p>
<p>再說王圻，就是那位赫赫有名的編續文獻通考的先生。他於官陜西參議後，歸家築室吳淞江濱，種梅千樹，名爲「梅花源」。老於其中，著書爲樂。他的藏書很豐富，和施大經，宋懋澄，愈汝楫並爲萬曆間松郡四大家。</p>
<p>淸代的藏書家，是愈多且愈偉大了，最著名的有李筠嘉，梅益徵，郁松年，徐渭仁等數家。現在篇幅不允許說了，下一回換個題目再來吧。</p>

<h3>旱災與稻作</h3>
<p>— 顧復</p>
<p>農業爲國家之命脈，而年歲之豐歉，常有賴於天時，普通治農業者，預料天時之如何，决定耕種之方法，如我國中部六七月間，爲梅雨期，故宜水稻之栽培，因插秧必須充足之水分也。但本年反常，至七月十九日，而梅雨未至。江南稻田，除瀕河之處，利用機器灌水，業已蒔秧外；山田平田之未能插秧者，尙有半數。且秧已萎枯，雖得沛霖，亦難恢復。而已蒔者，亦因河水涸竭，蒸發旺盛，生長遲緩，收成尙無把握。以衰落之農村，再逢災荒之年歲，農民生活。何堪設想！社會人士，對此問題，莫不關心。鄙人習農，知之更切。故敢供獻愚見，藉供參考云爾。</p>
<p>梅雨爲我國氣象上之雨季，但僅限於中部南部；尤以中部長江流域爲顯著。其時期在六月中下旬，氣壓甚低，常爲東北風。連日降雨。其雨量雖各年不等；但氣候陰濕，則爲常軌；降雨區域，常甚廣大。至七月上旬，則天氣晴爽，變爲驟雨，兼有雷嗚電閃，降雨區域甚爲狹小，其間有劃然之區分。但梅雨常發生變態；如民國廿年自四月中旬起至八月上旬幾全爲梅雨期，七月下旬一日之雨量，與本年一季之雨量相等。（民國二十年七月二十四日一日雨量一百三十三公厘民國二十三年四月至六月共計一百四十公厘）如民國二十一年民國二十二年，梅雨均提早，時日縮短，雨量稀少。本年（民國二十三年）自春季起，則鮮見雨量，試與六十年來乾旱之年歲比較之。</p>
<p>四月五月六月七份四個分雨份雨份雨份雨月合量量量量計公厘</p>
<p>光緖十四年五八·五五五·八八五·六九四·七二九四·六光緖十八年九八·七一六０·四六五·八七·二三三二·一光緖廿四年一三四·九一五九·０五四·四二六·八三七五·一民國廿三年六五·０四四·三三０·八二七·一一六七·三（至十九號止）</p>
<p>前三年據徐家匯天文台報吿；本年據無錫敎育學院氣象觀測室成績。故光緖十四年十八年及二十四年，雖六七兩月雨量不多，而四五月間尙有相當雨量。但本年則自春季起，已經乾旱，實六十年來最旱之一年也。更與陜西西安之平均雨量加以比較，更爲明顯：</p>
<p>四月份五月份六月份七月份　　（至十九號止）</p>
<p>民國廿二年無錫雨量六五·０四四·三三０·八二七·一陜西西安平均雨量三三·六五０·三四七·二九一·三增减增三一·四减六·０减一六·四减六四·二</p>
<p>由此觀之，本年夏季江南雨量，尙不如西北雨量。而西北素爲旱農制度，則本年江南普通慣行之農法，其不能適用，亦可瞭然矣。</p>
<p>救旱之方案，常有者與偶發者不同。常有者如吾國西北各省，救濟之方法，一在開掘溝渠，引黃河之水，以資灌漑，或各地掘并，利用地下水，供作灌漑水源。二在研究一種適於乾旱地方之農法，如選定耐旱之農作物，育成耐旱之品種，及施行淺耕，舖敷藁草，以防蒸發等。如美國西部，雨量亦少，故有乾燥農法Ｄｒｙ　ｆａｒｍｉｎｇ之制度。對於稻作，如南京鎭江等處，高亢之山田，有旱秧田之制，以育成抗旱性之稻秧。朝鮮地方梅雨常遲至七月中下旬始降，故有耐旱之乾稻。（播種時，播於乾田中，並不灌水，宛如旱稻。四圍築埂。降雨後，儲蓄水分，變爲水稻。）移植二次之方法。（秧逹適當程度，尙不降雨，水份不足。先以較狹之距離，移植於稻田之一角，以節水分，而維稻秧之生命。至梅雨大降，水分充足後，再移植於稻田中。）因各地氣候，有一定之模型，故農業隨之而有與此適應之一定方式。但本年之旱災，數十年中僅有一次，爲偶發的，不能嵌入一定之模型，而規定一種永久之農法。祇可隨隨機應變，應地制宜，設法救濟。但其救濟之要領，不外以最經濟的方法，利用植物生長所最需要的水分，從種子，栽培法，灌漑，水利之各方面着手，求逹此目的而已。</p>
<p>稻有旱稻水稻之二大類。普通栽培者，以水稻爲多。栽培水稻，常須浸濆水中，但耐旱之力亦甚强：如去年夏季久旱，稻葉枯萎捲縮，至立秋後，得雨寸許，仍能繼續生長，獲得相當之收穫。但大體言之，稻作感受旱災後，頗受影響。隨稻發育之程度。而被害狀况相異。秧田時期，雖逢久旱，因面積甚小，灌漑較易；且有旱秧田等方法，育成耐旱之秧，故被害甚輕。插秧時期，如逢乾旱，必致延遲插秧時期。因秧田密植，時期太長，養分不足，生長停頓。逸過插秧之適當程度稻秧衰弱，發育不良。如時期短，雖得雨再插，必致歉收。如時期長，稻秧枯萎，不能作種，如本年之情形也。插秧後之旱災，阻礙稻之分葉，莖葉矮小，甚至分葉全無，而逹抽穗，收量極少，如民國二十二年之情形。試就鄙人在無錫關原鄉西顧山一帶，調查稻莖長之結果表示如下：</p>
<p>插秧期（六月二十日）</p>
<p>調查日期罹旱災者（無水）未罹旱災者（繼續可灌田面乾裂）灌水田面濕潤）</p>
<p>七月二日八寸八寸二分七月廿九八雨二分一尺六寸八月十九一尺二尺二寸</p>
<p>罹旱災者，葉之先端枯萎，葉短而狹，分葉少，生長綏慢。雖至八月下旬得雨後，抽穗遲十餘日，且抽穗不齊，相差甚遠。</p>
<p>若經分葉盛期，陷於乾旱，則被害較輕。但葉已繁茂，蒸發量隨之而增，灌溉水亦易乾竭，故需水亦多。至穗形成期，如逢乾旱，爲害最大。此時斷水，或不能抽穗，呈萎缩狀態。或抽穗而不結實，收成大减。如乾旱時期加長，亘稻作發育之數期者，當然其害隨之加重。尙有伴旱災而生者，有稻熱病，蝗蟲，螟蟲，浮塵子等，則爲患更大矣。</p>
<p>稻之品種，對於旱害抵抗力，有强弱之分。凡分葉少，穗長，頴厚，葉色濃綠，葉肉厚之品種，抗旱力較强。而晚稻生長期長，消費之水分多，亦易陷於感受旱害，故以截培旱稻爲有利。在山田區域，冬春雨少，塘中儲水不多，恐罹旱災者，截培旱稻或乾稻亦可。</p>
<p>關於栽培法方面，耐旱之插秧方法，與普通不同。先用耡頭開溝，溝向東西，二溝之距離約一尺，每隔三四寸、植秧四五本，秧根向北，兩側覆土，用足踏實之，即適用普通旱田作物之移植法也。然後灌水，力求節約。普通在整地插秧除草之際，必須灌以多量之水，平時亦浸於水中，深達二三寸。今則灌水僅使土壤濕潤，稻仍可吸收水分，但水則毫無浪費。灌水後，足不踏入田内，與雨後不宜踏入旱田中同。</p>
<p>因患旱而田水乾涸者，即用耡頭等，淺削地表，以防由毛細管引水上升，而致蒸發，更於株間，撒佈藁桿，雜草，减輕水分損失。此後灌水，以濕潤土壤而止。如此以少量之水，可供大面積稻田之需用也。</p>
<p>患旱之稻田，宜用充足之肥料。因養分豐富，得雨後稻之生長，容易恢復也。</p>
<p>凡各鄉灌水制度，應集合有關係之各村，派選代表，設立灌水委員會。水之分配灌漑，灌水委員會有絶對權力，無論何人，不准自由開閉水口。如此水可平均分配，而免爭水之糾紛。萬一旱魃太甚之時，爲保全大部分之稻田計，甚至犧牲一小部之田地，亦所不惜。凡犧牲田，仍由隣近各田，分攤的賠償損失。若以摩登語表示之，可謂之灌水統制。若是水量節約，灌田可多矣。</p>
<p>此較根本的方法，爲水利之整理。試以江南爲例，一面浚濬通湖各河道，俾湖水得以暢流内地。一面重修沿江各閘，導入江水，而免河水之流失。但非政府籌撥鉅欵，無從進行。至於内地水淺之處，兩端築壩，由機器車水入河，增高水位，再用牛車，人車，戽入田内，則農民亦可合作辦理者也。</p>
<p>至於山田區域，不能插秧者，種植其他農作物，亦頗困難，在七月初，晚黃豆，赤豆，綠豆等，均可播種，現覺已失時令，惟有喬麥，可遲至八月上中旬播種，但能否耐旱，尙係問題，且一時難得多量種子。改種白菜蘿萄，又覺銷路不廣，儲藏爲難，恐不能提倡大面積之栽培。總之，在此種非常情形之下，救濟旱災，農學上苦無高明方法，祗可就各人能力所及，盡最善之努力而已。</p>
<h3>旱災與民食</h3>
<p>— 端生</p>
<p>本年夏訊（霉雨時季）的高熱，持久至一月光景，猶未得到足雨，擊退熱浪，而釀成六十年來未有之旱災。同時看到北美的加拿大美國，以及中歐東歐，並英倫，的旱與熱，甚至河中游魚亦會熱死。再看到日本的門司，下關，八幡各處，有「焦熱地獄」之稱，足見熱度的强烈非凡。不想到這一吹熱浪，將北緯三十餘度到五十四五度的大地包圍着，我們中國當然不　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>救災的工作最要的是如何能得到雨水，或則使已乾涸之河道仍得有水，其次就是受災的食糧種作物如何維護補救，目前的糧食如何調節。又其次是防疫，防火，防刦。都是大旱時候應行預籌或辦理的事件。可是求雨，雖則科學昌明到現代的地步，亦僅能偶作試騐，至祈禱更不必說了，豈能有回天之力。因此祇有設法就有水之處灌輸至無水之處。然而也須平時有備，若至臨事張皇，業已無及。故目前所當討論的，還是在被災農作物及糧食方面之如何補救。關於前者本期已有顧復先生的一旱災與稻作」一文，將被災農作物之補救維護，說得詳盡。本文紙就糧食方面略加討論，聊充篇幅而已。</p>
<p>自從入霉以後，天氣祇見其旱熱。莳秧失時，已莳秧水。而遭旱區域，又爲素以產米著稱之蘇，浙，皖，贛，鄂，諸省。於是形勢驟見嚴重，人心皇皇，乃予糧商及團户以可乘之機會。米價暴漲，不一月，由七八元一石之價漲至十三四元以上，這是何等狂熾啊。</p>
<p>我們要研究漲的原因所在，據糧食業中人的說，當然是久旱無甘雨，要造成「大荒年」，所以糧價要上漲。這個理由很淺薄，要知道即使有，「大荒年」尙在將來。目前所喫的糧，還是去年所收穫的榖與現在之「旱」無涉。去年的米榖收穫究竟怎樣？我們不妨以米商於此次旱災以前之言行證之，可以證明是豐收有餘。所以要屢請政府准予出口，要進口洋米徵稅要設法維持米價。即無米商之說，從米的價格統計上一爲觀察，雖說物價之低落，不盡是豐收之影響，但總逃不出供求的支配。下表係從社會經濟月報上海米價統計表中，將新榖方登之月起（假定爲十月）至四月止之米價，（五月以下尙未見發表）抄錄於後，（單位銀元）</p>
<p>粳米秈米</p>
<p>最高價最低價最高價最低價廿二年十月九·七五八·八０七·七０七·０五十一月八·六０七·九０七·三０六·四五十二月八·三０七·八０七·一０六·四二廿三年一月八·二二七·九九七·一０六·九０二月八·二一八·０八七·一０六·九０三月八·００七·七五六·九０六·七０四月八·一０七·八０六·九五六·七五</p>
<p>米價這樣的低平，不說他不豐收，有所不得。那末，六月中旬以至最近之米價上漲，全是借目前的旱，做他的投機生意。因爲目下的米，一般農民手裹可說絶無僅有了：有之，亦僅鄉間之富農及地主方面；大部分早經糶賣於米商，囤户販頭手中。假使米在農民手中，米價固欲上漲，其勢以漸不以驟。若在，米商囤户之手中，漲風之來，那就不可遏制。正爲農民散漫，聞米價上漲，必有陸續出賣，此爲節制漲風而有餘。米商囤户，相聨一氣，能以集中的力量，掀起市上的漲風，是以愈貴愈要買，越漲越不肯賣。但如彼所憑籍操縱的機會工具，稍經摧折其跌勢亦强。觀於此次上海的米市當旱象初成未深米價方漲未高之際，本市囤户大爲活躍，米商之有米者復不肯輕易出售，米價乃有亦步亦趨之勢。及聞政府有限價之說，知高利之不可驟獲，囤積之意氣稍懈，米價頓見鬆軟之狀。此外如聞定購洋米而跌，如見天雨而小，在在足以看出此次之漲，全係人心作用，投機行動，而非眞正的供求關係。至於靑黃不接時之上漲，歷年如是，但去秋究非大歉之年，本年米價即欲稍高，何至有如是之鉅。再觀去年靑黃不接時期之米價，所高亦至有限。則去秋之收成，難道大遜於前年，想亦不至於此。下表即去年靑黃不接時期之米價統計：（根據社會經濟月報統計）</p>
<p>粳注秈米</p>
<p>年月最高價最低價最高價最低價廿三年五月八·八０八·０五七·八八七·二五六月八·五０七·九０七·四０七·００七月九·五五八·００七·八０七·００八月八·九三八·四五七·七０七·０五九月八·七七八·四０七·四０七·００</p>
<p>從上表，米價愈接近新榖登塲之時者，其價愈低，此可反證去年秋收之良好。則此刻米價之暴漲，更見其爲操縱所致。</p>
<p>自從上海米價上漲之後，風擊所播，如響斯應。有米者咸懹居奇之心，各地米價隨之上漲；販運者意存觀望，滬上到源日見稀少。於是上海之銷地，與内地之產區，米價上漲，互爲因果。有錢者見米有漲價之可能，亦思染指，致有今日之局面。米商囤户，可進一步爲洋米之購買，因欲購買洋米，又作洋米進口免稅之運動。</p>
<p>目下固需要大宗洋米接濟否？此問題，除販賣洋米者外，無敢爲肯定之答辭。其實也無從答起。蓋以我國食糧方面；素來缺乏調查統計。在以前尙有地方官按期報吿秋成，雖曰具文，如今並此而無之。所以爲盈爲絀，有餘不足，無從推算。即年豐年歉，亦僅爲比較推測之辭。號稱豐收之年，鄉農仍多饘粥不綸無米爲炊。然此尙非食糧之供給問題，而爲農民之貧窮問題，有米在前，亦無力購買。不過從歷定上觀察，歷來沿海諸省，或災重年分，有時，要靠洋米接濟。（詳見馮楖堂著中國歷代民食政策史第二七章）自人國民以來，洋米進口之數量，雖不致年增一年亦可謂步步升高。及至民國十七十八兩年江南米荒之後，洋米居然占進口貨中之首次席。自十九年秋收吿豐，最近數年亦號稱有秋而洋米進口仍不少，此則大部聁爲閡粤方面銷路。可是本米已大受洋米之害！新榖旺登之時，往往以市上積有大宗洋米，使米價更難振作；或者價格稍好，洋米即乘機輸入。本米爲洋米所壓抑，農民喫了大虧。直至本年徵收進口稅，洋米始稍受打擊。今年秋收如果稍豐，農民可稍紓喘息，農村可望逐漸復興。不料以霉令旱熱，米價爲米商囤户所操縱，狂漲橫跳，不可一世。農民手中米，爲了連年農產物價低落，農村經濟枯窘逹於絶點，雖不至於「二月賣新絲，五月糶新毅」，然已早經糶脫，大都在巨商豪富及田主手中。故現在米價上漲，是囤户的利益，非農民的利益。農民到如今，反要向市上買米吃，那末，定購洋米，以之平凖米價，正歡迎之不暇，無可加以懹疑之理。</p>
<p>不過，今年的田稻，如果有收，終須歡折，且因戽水之故，成本加重。若有大宗洋米進口，竟或致新米行市爲所壓抑，農民經濟勢必更形不支。所以對於定購洋米接濟民食之原則，絶端贊成。欲加討論者，爲洋米之數量問題。即商人爲自身營業計。定購洋米，亦無所用其可否。官廳驟欲定購大宗洋米，用以維持民食，固致其欽佩。但應考慮者兩點，一即目下之在米究有多少？此則惟有以政府之力量，才能從米糧產銷巨區，實地調查，加以統計，俾知存糧，能否維持至出新爲止，如其不足，則應採辦多少洋米，此對目前之民食而言。至於未來，要在災區損害較爲明瞭之後。蓋旱災年分，往往同在一地，甲坵之田，有水可溉，竟會十成收穫；乙坵之田，無水可灌，或致颗粒無收。所以旱災年分收成，至難整一，有豐有歉，因此而有「荒熟年」之稱。再則最易受旱災之害者，當然爲高田，或缺少河道之處。至向以盛產稻米著稱之地方，則其地形必卑窪，灌漑必便利，水鄉澤國，爲稻稔最適宜之所。故受水災之摧殘易，而受旱災之摧殘難。旱災不過多費人力水本，水災則汪洋一片，蕩然無存。農諺有之：「旱災一條綫，水災一大片：」正見稻田所受水旱災損害之不同。或以爲調查存糧，政府公牘往返，七迥八轉，果眞米糧缺乏，要在存糧調查明白之後，再行定購洋米，不是小百姓旱已吃了貴米嗎？不過從各方面觀察，就目前而論，則以現存的米，接濟眼前的食，似乎不至十分困難。最顯著一例，則爲滬上米商之洋米免稅運動。滬上米商不是最近要訂購洋米五十萬石，派代表晋京呈請政府免除進口稅？他們的理由，當然是調節民食，平凖米價，好似完全從我們吃飯的人利益着想。其實或須尙有一點蘊蓄在内。他們所以定購洋米，以洋米之價較目前上海之米價爲廉，（報載米業中人語爲十元之數）如果販賣，必然有利可獲。但回想目前的米價，究爲自然的趨勢？抑爲人造的局面？米業中人當然比我們見得深切，瞻前顧後，頗有幾分危險。因此要想一保險方法，｜保障他們定洋米不至有蝕本危險的辦法。就想到免除洋米進口稅。因爲合上海十元一石的洋米，如果免除了進口關稅，祇有七元左右一石。照現在的米價，獲利優厚。即或米價回小，然目下正爲米價季節上漲時期，决無再小至進本以下。故免稅逹到目的，米商獲利可操左券。然則米商何以對於定購洋米尙虞虧折呢？正爲米商亦不信存米不能敷出新前之用，未來之秋收，究竟歡折如何？亦難預料。又如今日（二十一日）申報商業新聞所載，已可看出米商定購洋米之　躇情形，」</p>
<p>······洋米定貨，繼續接洽打電中，打了電報不下十多萬包，但產價已漲，昨電又漲四五角，則此項電報尙係二三天前行情形，勢難成交，倘高價定妥，則虧本可待，因目下滬市已經平落，合成本均須高出近元，以後市價再小則曲折更鉅，祗有一部分米商希望當局免稅進口，則可合劃，並推舉代表赴京請願，然免稅即使成爲事實，則滬價定須再落，產價再高，高低相懸，復難合算矣。······</p>
<p>蓋米商所顧慮者，假使定購大宗洋米之後，囤户出檔；旱災或以得雨，及後此晴雨調匀；或補種其他作物，不至十分失收；那米價不會續小麽？所以要求免稅，將使所定進之洋米，不致遭受預計之損失，正以見現存米糧尙不至十分缺乏。</p>
<p>洋米免稅，以惠消費者，名義何嘗不正大。但實惠如何及於消費者，大是問題。米價受市塲交易之支配，本米如漲，洋米亦必隨之而高。米在米商手中，欲使其將免稅之米，售廉宜之價，在事實上如平時無管理組織者，煞是難事。結果；免稅之後，徒爲米商在米價下跌時，保賠虧蝕之險；上漲時，增加優厚之利。不會以免稅之洋米，售價特别低於米糧大市之下。將來果眞有洋米進口免稅之必要，亦應另籌方策，使免稅之利益，直接及於消費者，不爲居間者所侵蝕，以達免稅之眞實目的。</p>
<p>言雖如是；現在已爲靑黃不接時候，即無其他助因，米價尙會上漲，何况今年有旱災呢？又何况江浙有許多田畝，已是「錯過黃梅弗種田」。即存活之稻，至新榖登塲，尙需時日，秋風秋雨，正不知有無波折。故米價掀腾之機會正多。民食尙未脫嚴重時期，後此如何調節，自屬當務之急。則大宗洋米之要否定購，應在政府深慮熟籌之中。</p>
<p>當局對於此後民食之調節辦法，尙無正式表示。大約當待諸今日（二十一日）行政院臨時會議之後。所可討論者，祇有據十九日報載救災之治標辦法。略謂：</p>
<p>初步注重糧食之影響，嚴禁糧食釀酒，及糧食出口。必要時規定糧食價格，限制抬高。·····</p>
<p>即照此一加研究。</p>
<p>（一）禁止糧食釀酒　這是古來糧荒時一種救濟辦法。他的出發點，以爲酒可以不飲，而糧食之耗於製酒者甚夥，禁酤即所以維持民食。但是有幾項値得考慮。</p>
<p>（一）釀酒就米而論，一爲穤米而非秔米，一般所煮食者爲秔米而非穤米。故二者之行市不盡相同。冬令製酒製糕之時，穤米價格往往高於秔米；過此則漸低。若如本年。穤米之價較爲低廉，遂有攙於秔米中出售之譽。穤米之大宗去路爲製酒，此外僅爲粉餅糕揠之用。雖云饑荒之歲，草根樹皮，以之充飢。秔穤同爲米，何致有偏棄之理。而不念穤米產額不多，食用各殊，禁酤固無甚裨於民食也。</p>
<p>（二）目下米酒，已漸爲洋酒所打倒。若再禁酤，不啻又爲洋貨張目，打倒國產，諒爲以提倡國貨自任者所不取。</p>
<p>（三）禁酤如嚴厲執行，勢必擾及民間，若奉行故事，則何有於禁。古代爲禁酤而騷擾者多。故至淸代，雖亦有時頒禁酤之令，但已不常行，諒亦知其爲無謂。猶憶三國時，蜀中荒，禁酤，並釀具有禁。民間犯令者衆，深以爲累。無敢禁阻。會法正侍先主立台上。見有男子過，正即遙指其人爲犯姦。先主訝之，法正曰，其人身懹淫具也。先主悟，乃罷禁酤之令。（原文如何，及所引人名有無錯誤，以案頭無三國志，無從查得，惟事實固如此。作者附識）</p>
<p>（四）米酒大宗產於紹興，各地亦多自製，恃以爲活者衆。一旦禁酒，將有大批失業之民，倒閉之肆，又豈維護工商之道。</p>
<p>（五）酒爲食用必需品，非鴉片嗎啡可比。禁酤之後，將於人民日常生活，大感不便。」</p>
<p>故以禁止釀酒爲救濟民食之先决問題者，擾民有餘，成事不足，想不致有實現之可能。</p>
<p>（二）禁止糧食出口　此之所謂出口，諒指出口至外洋而言，不包括本國此口岸運往彼口岸之糧食在内，本來我國糧食，尙未至有餘以供給他人之地步，何至允許輪出外洋。如其有之，亦爲當局之失檢，致有今日重提禁糧出口之議。無之，則更談不到禁止出口也。</p>
<p>（三）規定糧食價格　如其爲逐日糧價，由官廳或會同米商公同評定，仍視市上到銷情形，以爲變遷，不加限制。雖以官廳之威力，囤户歛迹。但如無限制辦法，賣户仍可居奇；米商仍可操縱，價格仍可上昇。故如此辦理，僅不過將商人開價，置於官廳監督之下，是爲公開評價。若欲不使米價過分上抬，終須有一限制。則此之所謂規定價格，諒不是如此說法，而爲由官廳規定一最高價格，責令遵守，逾越即所不許；是即限價之謂。限價在上海屢行之，其初亦遭受種種破壤阻撓，其後當有相當成效。（見「上海民食問題」之「社會局民食行政」）爲責難之說者，以爲當荒年，昔有令有米者得增價而糶，所謂「價高可以徠遠貨。」俾商人聞風而至，糧艘雲集，米價可不平而自平。何必限價，轉令望而生畏，裹足不前，反致來源缺乏，爲害民食。此其言亦至有理。然法無一成不變，正反或資以相生，端在運用之者何如耳！限價之效，在糧荒漸成，米糧有而不多，米價已高，正是囤户居奇米商操縱之候，施之爲有效。若至存積罄竭，限價亦何能收效。故限價所以制止囤積居奇；使之知道米價至此已臻絶點，無再高之望。囤户見希望已絶，亦必陸績出售。惟應考慮者，限價之後，往往有下列情形：</p>
<p>（一）囤户不肯出糶，作何處置，</p>
<p>（二）販户不肯上市，作何處置，</p>
<p>（三）發生暗盤贴價，作何處置，</p>
<p>（四）將次貨充高貨，作何處置，</p>
<p>（五）互相勾結要挾，作何處置，</p>
<p>（六）米糧來源或斷，作何處置，</p>
<p>再則規定價格，亦有研究之必要。現在限價，往往就已成之局面，以爲市價已高，即規定照此出糶，不得上抬。如現在米價售十三元，照歷　米價，認爲已高，即規定爲十三元。及至米價因暗盤貼價而實際不能維持其限價時，則又寛放一元兩元。如此辦法，易滋流弊。限價如何　　，則使人生僥倖之心，　盤貼　之弊更深。如限定之後，不再寛放，則限價至實際上不能維持時，難道裝聾不聞，自隳威信；抑固執限價，諸所不惜。似此皆非正當辦法。故以爲糧價節節上漲有團積居奇實蹟，足可危害民食，而政府不得不出而干涉時；其初步爲眼同開市，便操縱居奇者聞而長避。至仍不能節制時，乃出於限價。價格之規定，至少　　於兩種價目之間；（一）即現存之米應需之成本，（二）即現在之市價。（一）：成本計算頗不易，平時對於囤積有登記者固不難照其進本加上利息，雜費而爲計算。至限價時計算成本，勢不能如此辦理。應先求一假定之進本。此進本之假定，自爲難事。蓋爲各人買進之時期，有先有後，價格亦有高有低。如何較爲執中，祇有採用平均數之一法。大槪米價高漲之時期，在五月以後，出新旺期，在十月十一月之間。即以出新起至季節性上漲之一時期内之價格十大約爲上年之十二月至翌年之五月，因米俱在此六個月時間内，｜作一平均價，姑且假定作爲囤房之買價（以甲代之，）再加上米糧存儲期内蝕耗量（以乙代之）之代價，合之即爲囤米之進本。此外再加上此時間内利息（丙），棧租（丁），雜費（戊），等等，其和即爲囤米假定之成本。式如下：</p>
<p>成本＝（甲＋乙）＋丙＋丁＋戊</p>
<p>再加上囤户希翼之利益，即可視爲市上應售之價。更與現在的市價一爲比較，而規定一適當價格，此或可較易折服商人之心，使米價人於正軌。</p>
<p>以上云云，都是抱佛脚不足以解决民食問題。解决民食問題，仍在食糧自給，方爲治本之計，食糧自給，在我國不是一件難事。如果有一定方針，切實計畫，不騖高調，不當夸大，數年之内，必有成效。不過照目前情形，即無水旱偏災，食糧尙虞不給。何况無年無災。是在未能治本之前，還得治標。治標大要，爲　　（一）流通國内糧產　流通國内糧產，不能成爲一條件，而在現狀之下，居然爲一重要問題。以交通之設備不周，運輸之費用昻貴，糧產運銷，頗不便利。往往甲地有紅朽之粟，乙地有饑饉之患。是以流通國内糧產，劑有餘補不足，使產銷者均得其利，爲目今之要圖。往者八省糧食會議有糧食運銷局之籌設，迄今雖未觀成，想不久終當實現。其使命至重大。蓋一方欲靠運銷局之力，使各省糧產，不致以運銷不便，而贬其價値，農村經濟收復興之效。另一方面，欲以調節國内糧食之盈虚，兼寓常平微意於其間，是併積儲採銷爲一事，其工作之艱鉅可見。又一方面，則與糧商營業，旣有時不無相衝突，而採銷手續，以及種種設備，復至爲繁蹟。事業則不容以營利爲目的，而在在有盈虧之得失，故其辦理亦至不易。此外則國内生產消費漫無把握，水旱災荒無年蔑有，皆足爲本事業之困難。</p>
<p>（二）節制進口糧食　進口糧食已徵稅，尙不足以盡節制之能事。吾人所以採辦上國糧食，原期收調節我民食之益，而無壓迫我農產之害。乃歷來結果，補助我民食則有之，而我大宗金錢滾滾以去。有時洋商出其剩量，傾銷我市塲，而我農產價格，奄奄不振。商人不明市塲銷納，不顧國内生產，見米價高漲則互相爭定洋米，陷於過剩而不目覺。及至市價下跌，傾家蕩產，噬臍無及，咎果由於自取，但本國農產已爲洋糧充斥，無法得善價，而大受其累。此皆對於進口糧食太放任之故。欲補偏救弊，非行進口許可制不可。先就外國糧食進口最多之地方，委任各該政府，凡欲定購烊米，非向官廳登記，領取執照，則海關不許其進口。政府乃將其定購之洋米種類，到銷數量，未到數量，按月公布之，俾商人得知所取舍，中央復彙集各地報吿，調查國内糧產，認爲有限制之必要時，得减發或停發採辦執照，俾不致危害我糧產，而仍收調節之益。</p>
<p>（三）糧食管理辦法　在民食恐慌之候，欲抑個食糧之投機，平準糧價，或進而謀食糧之分配，囤積之徵發。皆爲法無明文，執行不易。好商豪賈，乃得陰肆壤；巧吏猾胥，從中廣緣爲利。政府旣有維持民食之决心，並有必不得已時，規定糧食價格限制抬高之路。則至何種時期，官廳方得規定糧食價格，定價而破壤者如何處置；執行有空碍者如何補救，又如何使危害民食之奸商，不至倖免制栽；復如何使貸責之官廳，不至濫用職權，摧殁糧業：此皆有待於法令之規定。固知食糧管理法制定之不易。但此僅就糧荒緊急處理，再最高主管官署訂立辦法，公布施行，俾官商俱知有所尊循也。</p>
<p>此三者亦僅粗舉大略。吾人所希望者，仍在政府呈事確定民食政策，釐畫綢要，逐步籌備，分期進行。以之解决民食問題，即所以實現民生生義也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>浦儀讀書</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>自從九一八日本攫佔東北之後，不管國際間是怎樣的對中國「同情」，咱們又是不惜千方百計的貫澈「不承認」，事實上已經成了别人的土地。本來這樣的形勢，關東軍司令更名「滿洲國」皇帝就得了，可是國際間情形又不能不使其顧及，因之也同我們不承認的苦衷一樣；便巧立名目，多玩花樣，强奸民意的成立一「滿洲國」，將溥儀這寳貝弄去作幌頭，沐猴而冠，袍笏登塲。</p>
<p>溥儀之所以奇貨可居，在本屐朋友眼裹有二；一是可裝元首而無實力，在世界皇家展覽會上陳列，得厠身列國之林；一是在東北老百姓們的心裹還有點「名器」，用這二十五年前曾於懹中得登龍位的溥儀來當皇帝，以適合他們企求「眞命天子」的心理。</p>
<p>其實這兩項都可謂失敗了。這愛親覺羅氏的皇胄子孫，掩師不了日本在東北純全殖民地的侵略行爲；同時在東北民衆中也未能絲毫把他們懾服，事實上的血的敎訓，使他們認淸楚「王道樂土」者，十八層之阿鼻地獄也。所以幾年來「三國千涉還遼」的夢想，絲毫也未使日本掛懹，等於大舞台上忠臣義士說說而已的「收復失地」，木屐朋友看來直等茶館中的講白攤，到成千成萬的義勇軍，「殺家赴難」的英雄，以血肉與敵人相鬥搏，弄得日本寢不安蓆，表現了民族爭自由解放的途徑。誰說中國目前搞敵無力只有含羞忍辱是「愛國」的眞理，事實上在敵人數十萬大兵鎭壓下的東北，義勇軍的活動，幾年來就成了侵略者最憂心的問題。</p>
<p>爲了要完全征服這一新的殖民地，日本就進行牠槍砲所不能奏效的辦法，消滅民族意識的奴隸敎育。這一政策除了抑制大多數民衆的文化發展，麻醉與愚民之外，還培植少數忠於「日滿」的走狗。前者如停辦許多鄉村小學的敎育就是表現，後者則無數日語專修學校的成立，官費留日學生的甄選，甚至於所謂「少女訪問團」，「隨軍宣撫隊」都是事實。最近將成立的滿蒙貴胄子弟學堂維城學校，與乎溥儀之將就該校校長並同時每週上課日文十二小時，也是這一政策下扮演出來的趣劇。這是前幾日東北社長春的通訊；「暴日以愚惑東北民衆，尤須自御用之傀儡統治階級始，故日人又嗾使傀儡，最近卽將成立一所謂滿蒙貴，胄子弟學堂，而命名曰維城學校，校長由溥儀自任······但將來彼且須爲該僞校之一大學學生，卽每星期溥逆須在該僞校上課十二小時，以研究日語」。</p>
<p>這一事件使我們甚麽認識？顯然，所謂「貴胄子弟」，就是那些耀官顯宦紳士聞人的兒子，而他們以前却都是「愛國不敢後人」的人仕。所以東北自有僞國後，少部的這等「，成爲新貴，子弟入貴胄學校！而另一大部份人則在冰天雪地中，「靑沙帳」裹爲破碎碎山河作戰，這描畫出何者是賣國，何者又是愛國者。「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花」，我們觸目到江南都市中哥子公兒們的享樂情表，使人興無限的慨歎，第恐國恨者非僅商女，其行徑將不限於唱唱後庭花而已！</p>
<h3>升天記</h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>下了幾次雨，果然凉快得來了。開了南窗，在燈光下讀書，沒有飛蛾的撲繞，也不致揮汗如雨，禱雨法會的偉大的功續，我們該怎樣的敬致十二萬分的謝意呢！</p>
<p>一陣陣風從窗口吹拂進來，隱隱的和着遠處的蟬聲，人飄飄然的，彷彿冉冉上降，前面隱約一個道冠八卦服的人引導，像踏着雲塊似的祇聽見風聲呼呼的從耳邊吹過。我懹疑入了夢境，啟口問前面引導的道長，他盛氣的回答：「書獃子，多讀了紅樓夢耶，那裹來的夢境？你在窗前讀書，天蓋紅光入透雲霄，知你根底尙深，故引你往天宫一走。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「他說着向前面一指」那邊已是南天門了。」</p>
<p>我極目看去，果見一座高大無比的牌樓，上書南天門三字，閃閃作金光，因問道長姓甚名誰，上天有何貴幹？</p>
<p>「貧道姓張，尊稱大師，家居龍虎山，爲因久旱不雨，田地荒蕪，下界臣民恐懼，築壇祈雨。貧道正在蒲團打坐，搯指一算，是乃天孽，無可挽回，因世風日薄，玉帝判令旱災一年，以敬效尤。惟有善臣善民，願爲庶民贖罪，日夜祈禱，貧道有好生之德，姑往上宮一走。」</p>
<p>言竟，已抵南天門，王靈官手執金鞭，將我攔住去路，張大師竊竊與彼私語，乃放我進門。不數步，又遇二郎神楊戢帶其黑犬徘徊道左，大師又與竊語，於是逃進天門。</p>
<p>半途，張大師謂余曰：「玉宮禁地，閑人莫入，違者定不赦，因余與王靈官二郎神有私誼，故放汝一遊。余上殿奏本時，切不可探頭探腦，否則命休矣！」</p>
<p>言訖，大師踏步前去。我東張張，西望望，心中雖懹着鬼胎，别被太監宮女們等瞥見，盤問底細，如何是好？故走曲幽小徑，那邊種着的都是奇卉異草，我像劉老老進了大觀園，喜歡不勝，不覺忘了禁令信步前進，只見一坐輝皇宮殿，石級千層，兩旁衛士，刀出銷，威風凛凛，張大師方整其冠，揮其襟，手振朝笏，目不斜視，拾級而上矣。</p>
<p>我想人生千歲，難得上天，不怕千刀萬剮，繞道至殿後，幸喜寂然無人。殿後毁一角，不加修理，想係財政枯竭所致，我乃就隙而窥焉。</p>
<p>祇見張大師依伏丹墀，三跪九叩，然後奏摺獻上，半響，殿内不聞人聲，兩班臣相木立如呆鷄，大師亦俯伏不動。</p>
<p>「准卿所奏！」忽然一聲，驚人魂魄，但爲殿角所限，不見其人，至今認爲憾事也。</p>
<p>言敷畢，兩班臣相及張大師均三呼萬歲。</p>
<p>我就再繞道到和大師分手處等候，果見大師欣欣然來，我故間曰：「所奏准乎？」</p>
<p>「旣犯天怒，本無挽回，玉帝因感下界善臣善民等之虔誠祈雨，更貧道力奏之功，始令龍王卽降甘霖，以舒民困。」言罷哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>我抬頭一望、頃刻之間鳥雲四佈，大帥握我手曰：「大雨來也，速行！」</p>
<p>未抵南天門，雨下傾盆，一時人聲鼎沸，大呼曰：「落大雨哉！」</p>
<p>我張目四望，乃一夢境，南窗碰碰作響，書卷盡濕，窗外方大雨也。</p>

<p>入夏以來，天氣突然亢旱酷熱，農田龜裂，災象已成，於是九流三敎以及各界有道者流，大家來大施法術，設壇祈雨，果然蒼天靈，大爲感動，因此天忽凉爽，大雨時降，是果誰之功歟？</p>
<p>天主敎徒曰，我輩舉行求雨，敬禮九日，至第八日本市卽細雨霏霏，炎暑稍殺，近日時雨時晴，不日卽有大沛甘霖之望，此是我主天主之功。</p>
<p>道家者流曰，求雨之舉，史不絶書，惟祈禳一事，推道家最爲擅長，茲又適逢嗣漢六十三代天師張瑞齡，息影滬濱，請求設壇作法，冀沛甘霖，近日得雨，是張天師之功。</p>
<p>佛敎之徒曰，班禪大師，爲我國活佛，前日在寳華山棲霞山等處，設壇祈雨，天然我佛有靈，宏施法雨，普渡衆生，這是我佛大慈大悲之功。</p>
<p>一般鄉愚之流曰，東海龍王，頗爲靈騐，數日來迎神賽會，大出草龍，牛怪蛇神，樣樣都有，因此龍王嘘氣成雲，吐沫成雨，這是我海龍王菩薩之功。</p>
<p>吁是果誰之功歟？</p>
<h3>在馬路上走着</h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>爲了生活的鐵鞭在背上敲打着，不得不在大熱天跑上馬路去，住的地方就在馬路邊一條終日晒着太陽的弄堂，一出門，天空就板起暈濁不淸的面孔儘瞧着我，太陽的火手立刻伸到了我的身上，一陣襲擊似的感覺，熱啦。而我在今年却沒有買帽子，｜不，曾經買了一頂籐絲編的帽子戴了幾天轉賣給朋友去了｜｜頭髪是黑的，感熱最快，皮膚上晒得熱起來的時候，頭髮已經晒得就好像一團火在頭頂上燃燒。皮膚被晒還不覺得什麽，可是從頭髮熱起來，不，應該說熱下去，熱到頭頂上，熱到腦壳裹，神經受了襲擊了，腦壳痛之外，頭暈立刻感覺到了。脚下在走路，頭上感覺到熱痛不過，忙將手兒抬上去遮住頭髮。這一舉動很明白地是下意識作用，滿想用手兒去抵抗太陽，就好像英雄們挺身而出以庇護受災難的女子一樣：等到手掌受了火燒着似地被太陽襲擊着以後感覺到熱不過，這才意識明白地感覺到這是傻子幹的事。</p>
<p>走着走着，眼睛對於頭上的太陽是不敢望他們，可是面前的景物爲了便利走路起見，那是非望望不見，如果一不留心，說不定從轉變的地方闖出了一兩部汽車，不用說會死於輪下，就是那警吿的喇叭，好像鬼呌地呌了一聲也够你心頭卜通卜通地跳個不了。望望馬路上的景物，大熱天，風絲都沒有，就是偶然地迎面吹了一下，也是一陣熱辣辣的熱氣息，壓迫着你呻不出氣來還不要緊，那一股熱辣辣的氣色硬闖進了你的鼻腔裹頭去，喉嚨立刻乾喝而打嗆起來。望望馬路上的景物，商店的布旗子哭喪着臉似地吊在半空中兀着不動；汽車馳過去，一陣灰塵就在牠的屁股後頭跟着飛揚起來，迫到你的眼前，脚下，我的天，那柏油融化了啦！你的鞋子走過去，喳喳吱吱地哭起來；，那柏油是熱到了沸點了吧，牠儘在融化，融化，而你的鞋子從牠上面走過去，踏下了很難拔起來，假如穿的是橡皮底的鞋子，準定可以融化在一起，那你就好像陷入泥潭裹頭似地受了難以形容的危險了。好在我穿的是皮鞋，雖然是中國皮鞋蹩脚貨，邀天之幸，從柏油上面走過去，還不至於融化在一起。</p>
<p>在馬路上走着，太陽用火攻似地晒炙了你的身上的皮膚，晒災了你的頭上的黑髪，大熱天，我憤恨了這社會：爲什麽有的人能够坐汽車，有的人却非跑路不行？在馬路上走着，這一種不安分的念頭，使我陷入幻想裹頭。</p>
<h3>反常的心理！</h3>

<h3>走捷徑</h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>走捷徑也，就是取巧兒，不願費相當的勞力，却能收穫很高度的結果。那麽，努力一分就能得一分報酬的名言也祇是等於零！</p>
<p>這種習性，在國人的眼目中造成很大的勢力、你看吧，社會上幾乎是沒有一件事，沒有一個人，不是想走捷徑。處處施展着黠智，到處利用别人來成，就自已；可是有時候也會無形中被别人，利用着。辦事祗是問效果怎樣，却不肯按步就班，脚踏實地去做，狡滑，欺詐，便也由此而生！可是呢，走捷徑祗是走捷徑，沒有灰石鐵筋，如何會建築得起樓房來！就拿敎育來說吧，三十幾年來，從開辦各種速成班，直到現在迎了源頭去採用歐美的新學制，新敎育學說，什麽學分制，大學院，以至於被小學校採用的道爾登制設計法；那一件不又是走的捷徑，可是實行的效果呢，半點也沒有收到，祇是多繞幾個大大的圈子而已！</p>
<p>這並不是想抹殺了後來者居上的事實，你能說維新後的日本不爲是並駕於歐美嗎？可是，迎頭去學和走捷徑却是截然可分的事實，迎頭去學，還得十二分努力的做，不是學了就可以成功，何况還有適於或不適於那現有的環境呢。我們已經取了迎頭學的巧；而還要走捷徑，眞是想用火柴桿搭樓房！</p>

<h3>跳出牢籠</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個已有二十歲的人了，曾讀過幾年書，現在某日廠裹作苦工，一天不過拿着四五角錢的工資，却是用盡渾身精力和血汗換來的，並且還要受那些如狼似虎的日人的兇暴虐待。但我爲了生活關係，所以終是忍氣呑聲地由他們怎樣使喚。唉！我在這樣壓迫着的工作下已有二三年了。近來該廠更和以前不同，什麽减少工資，增加工作等的事件，漸漸的發生。這苦刻工人的行爲，令人受了，無不呌苦，但是多數工友都還屈服在他們的金錢之下。無法可想。（我當然也在内）現在我時常想要跳出這牢籠似的日廠，另找生活，不願再受他們的欺辱。我决意想到别的地方去做學徒，因爲我有十九歲，恐怕在年齡方面有妨碍，一時不敢隨意跳出該廠。心中很是躊躇不决。因此來請先生出一良法：（一）像我這樣的年齡可否再去做學徒，（二）如不能去做學徒，怎樣可不受他們的壓迫，務懇賜我玉言，替我找一出路。專此順頌</p>
<p>撰安你的信徒施文郁謹上答：你的生活的確是苦極了，然而，現在一般做苦工的人，誰不是在不能忍受的痛苦生活下掙扎呢！誰不是緊緊的被鎖在「牢籠」裹呢？我們不能再忍受下去了，我們急須要跳出這個「牢籠」。但是你所想到的跳出「牢籠」的辦法，我却不能同意，因爲你跳出了這個「牢籠」，恐怕不免又要進到别一個「牢籠」去。不錯，你廠裹近來漸漸發生减少工資增加工作等事，你們的生活是更要較以前不堪了，但，你可知道，最近的某綢廠某烟廠罷工，起因不也是由於「减薪」「加工」甚至裁减工人等事麽？天下烏鴉一般黑，在現社會下工人的命運，生活都是一樣的凄慘悲苦的，所有的差别祇多不過是五十步與百步而已。就是去做學徒，生活也未必見得就會增進，或許要更痛些。做學徒每月收入，大槪都在一二元左右，所做的工作也不見得輕鬆、兇暴虐待也在所不免，另外恐還要受到些東家無端的人格的凌辱。你不能忍受這苦刻工人的行爲，你不能屈服，你要謀出路，這自然是很應當的，但是要逹到解放的目的，不是負氣不幹，回到家裹去吃老米飯也不是「這山看得那山高」，到别一個廠家或别一種行業去做「苦工」，而是，面對着那些加在「苦工」身上的一切壓迫，盡可能的將它們除去。至於怎樣解除壓迫呢？那是很簡單的，誰給你們壓迫，你們就向誰喊出解放的口號，要使他以後不能再壓迫，惟受到壓迫，誰就應該提出反抗。祇有這樣，苦工們纔有解放的希望，生活纔有改善的一日，依舊忍氣呑聲由他們怎樣使喚，或祇是想消極的躱避他們壓迫的途徑，那就永無翻身的日子了。</p>

<h3>歸來（二）</h3>
<p>— 保加利亞伊凡·瓦卓夫作楊森譯</p>
<p>「再見哪，我的孩子！祝福你！」那母親大聲呌着。</p>
<p>「斯託揚！」那個少女也呌着。</p>
<p>但是他們的聲音是被喧騷埋沒了。斯託揚混身兵士裹，而全部的兵士是迅速地消失在大霧中。</p>
<p>那個母親仍是站着望，但再也看不見什麽了。</p>
<p>小女兒拾起她的圍裙的衣角，掩住了她的面孔。</p>
<p>斯託揚的母親，回到她的家裹，打開了一個老箱子，拿開汗衫，在箱子底下尋到一根大蠟燭。她點着了，放在聖像的前面，開始用低低的聲音祈禱着了······</p>
<p>就在這同時，在德拉戈曼的附近，槍砲聲轟嚮着。那正是一八八五年十一月四日的時候。</p>
<p>那一夜母親存娜作了一個夢。</p>
<p>她看見一大片雲彩，在雲彩裹運隊進行着，斯託揚也在其中。聖母瑪麗亞呀！這是多麽怕人的事！雲彩動薄着，天空顫抖着，大地震動着，好像是起了戰爭了。斯託揚消失在雲彩裹，於是再也看不見了。</p>
<p>這時存娜醒轉來。她的周圍全部是黑暗，一個漆黑的夜。在外面，風兇暴地狂吼着。一次戰爭······我主上帝，耶穌基督！保護他呀·聖母瑪麗亞·恩惠斯託揚吧！······</p>
<p>直到天亮她再也睡不着了。</p>
<p>「彼彼爹爹，夢見一片雲彩是什麽意思？」第二天早晨她問着。</p>
<p>「存娜，雲彩有兩種。有一種是落雨的雲彩，有一種是蒸氣的雲彩。你夢見的是那一種呢？」</p>
<p>她述說了她的夢境，彼德爹爹沉思着。</p>
<p>在他的詳夢的書裹，好像他運沒有遇見過這樣的一種雲彩。但是當他看見這個婦人的不安的面孔時，他就對她說，「不要怕，存娜，你的兒子是强壯而又快活。這雲彩酌意思是消息，你快收　斯託賜的信了。</p>
<p>那個母親的面孔立刻快活了。</p>

<h3>桃樂姗薇克的遭遇</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>桃樂姗薇克是一個從德國搬到好箂塢來的電影明星。她在美國的作品，已經有「梵音情淚」「小明星被刦記」等二部片子，都在本埠開映過了。看過她的作品的人，多少對於她有點影像，大約還沒有完全忘懹吧？最近在美國電影雜誌裹，看到一段關於她很不幸的消息；恐怕在這幾年裹頭，不會再看到她的作品了，這是很可惜的！</p>
<p>我們知道猶太人在美國電影界是有很大的勢力的。假使他們同盟反對一個星期，不再看這個明星主演的影片，這個不幸的明星，就沒有影片公司同她訂合同的希望了。桃樂姗薇克就是這個不幸的明星！</p>
<p>事情是因爲好萊塢起了一個謠言：說她是德國國社黨的黨員，猶太人最恨的是國社黨，於是美國全國猶太人辦的報紙，就請求在美國的猶太人，抵制她主演的影片，說她是拿美國的金錢送到德國去供給國社黨。當時各戲院正在開映她的小明星被刦記的，就立刻從廣吿上把她的名字除去了。剛巧派拉蒙同她訂立合同，也在那時候滿期，公司方面就不再繼續訂立新合同：且先看看風頭再說。别的公司當然不敢去聘請一個正在受人抵制的明星了。所以除非百老匯舞台方面能找到她的工作外·她祗好回到她的老家｜德國｜去了！</p>
<p>這個謠言是怎樣起的呢？因爲有人說她的丈夫是柏林國社黨重要機關報紙的主筆：雖然她同她的丈夫，加以否認，但是人家不去相信她的話是眞的。她曾經對一個訪員說：「我同政治毫無關係，並且我連政治是什麽我還不十分的懂得。我祗有一種興趣，就是在開末拉前面做我的工作。我的丈夫是在報紙上做小說的，同時是一個批評家。他雖然在報紙上工作已經有五年的歷史，但是他並不是國社黨機關報的主筆。他同國社黨的報紙毫無關係，除非你認爲每一種德國的報紙都是黨報」。</p>
<p>桃樂姗薇克現在所處的地位，派拉蒙公司是無能爲力的，那裹會有影片公司同一個正在受人抵制的明星訂約：就是她自已，也是無法可想。她雖然不是黨員，但是也不能聲明反對國社黨，她的老家是德國，她愛她的老家，並且將來終究是要回到她的祖國去的。難道她願意反對她祖國的統治者，去做一個無家可歸的流浪者嗎？但是除了這個反對國社黨的聲明外，還有什麽方法能够使得美國的猶太人滿足呢？</p>
<p>所以她只能靜待着這萬惡的謠言來毁滅她吧。</p>
<p>（缺章却酬。否則請卽來函聲明並補寄圖章。）</p>

<h3>評「半罪人」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｈａｌｆ　Ａ　Ｓｉｎｎｅｒ｜國泰</p>
<p>這裹所採取的是流氓游民之羣的平凡生活。正因爲是他們的平凡生活，所以在其中頗有不少可取之處。這中都是一些典型人物，有流浪的牧師，有無家可歸的少年男女，還有拳鬥者，小賊。他們的生活是飲酒，賭博，拳鬥，嚇詐，欺騙，祇有那一對靑年男女，他們很想好好的生活下去，但是社會不容許他們，於是入獄，被捕，雖然是誤會的，可是到底成爲他。們的平凡生活。</p>
<p>在這些人羣中，劇作者作爲笑料使用的虚僞的牧師，當然値得我們最爲注意的了。劇作者說明這牧師極端的虚僞，在婦人中他非常莊重自持，甚至將上帝頂在頭上向她們說敎。然而他的用意却是在乎騙她們賭博。他背着紳士淑女們的時候，飲酒，賭博，聽爵士音樂，可是當對衆人表示莊嚴的時候，他裝着不吃酒，聽禮拜堂唱詩的播音。劇作者在這些地方，由於導演之純熟的表現，這一牧師兩重人格的描寫，眞是諷刺得够了。</p>
<p>但是劇作者是沒有勇氣正面的和宗敎宣戰的，雖然由於這種牧師身上，充分的說明宗敎的欺騙虚僞；結果他終於不敢將那牧師毁滅，最後終於將他挽救過來，使他從流氓地痞那兒贏了許多錢，旣將借據還給店主人，更將靑年男女訂婚戒指的設法歸還。這些地方，固然是絶對的非現實，而劇作所以要如此擺佈却是要轉變觀衆對於他的惡感，連帶的向宗敎妥恊。這種倾向乃是一般美國電影作家共同的劣性，而本來是現實的題材中滲入這非現實的成份，在作品上却是很大的損失了。</p>
<p>和描寫牧師一樣，同時以二重人格的方法來處理的有那旅館女主人。她自稱爲某某夫人，她在客人之前裝扮着非常和善，但是另一方面却到處表現她的潑辣性，特别是使其在虚僞的牧師面前，從提包中落出撲克牌，以描寫她的人格的正反面，這在兩個都愛賭而又要彼此顧全面子的塲合，眞是非常够諷刺的了。</p>
<p>此外，在其他諸人身上，劇作者都有可愛的成功，這充分的表現出劇作者有着不少小聰明，同時表現技巧也是很成熟的。然而僅靠這些，决不能掩飾内容的空虚，雖然其中諷刺，嘲笑的成份非常可笑，可是在整個的作品，他沒有嚴正的指明他們的社會根據，以及他們必然的前途。他祇是以詼諧的手法將這人羣素描的嘲笑了一下，除了那靑年男女的戀愛部份之外，對於其餘的諸人，也沒有殘酷的憎惡，也沒有熱烈的同情。冷嘲熱諷的旁觀者的態度，便是劇作之正面的表現。卽使他對於牧師嘲笑得最厲害，可是最後終於投降了的。因此我們不能說這一作品有着特殊的意義存在。</p>
<p>從每一個塲面中都表現出導演是很盡職的，特别是從牧師身上，從拳鬥，賭傅諸事件上都癹現出有充分的生活經騐。然而他的功績也就在此，不管他手法相當經濟，但是在Ｍｏｎｔａｇｅ方面，却有些地方是時間與空間，不能很好的合理的剪接。而且，牧師的成功，一大半我們相信是演員個人的成功。ＢｒｅｔｏｎＣｈｕｒｃｈｉｌｌ的演技，眞是非常細膩的，他不僅是在面部或動作上表現出劇中人的二重人格，而且在說白的音調上，也是十分注意的。其他諸人總算是稱職而已，而女主角莎莉白鸞（Ｓａｌｌｉｅ　Ｂｌａｏｅ）較之在鮑才琪的「男性的慰藉」中，却大爲遜色了，這顯然是導演的緣故。</p>

<h3>伽薩諾伐第二</h3>

<p>伽薩諾伐（Ｃａｓａｎｏｖａ）不是亘古的第一個大情人嗎？他的全部生活，就是追逐女性。面異性所渴求的，也就屬於那種大膽敢爲之「熱」的爸爸（Ｈｏｔｐａｐａ）。所以；這位伽薩諾伐；能够有求必應了。同時，奪人之妻，取人所愛。豈能沒有相當代價，故今夜偷期，明晨决鬥，或入機阱，或跳牢籠，｜他那以生命博美人之秘史艷乘，成了現代浪漫史之聖經也。可是吾們那位大鼻子胡說博琥祁美杜倫，他很不服氣，難道天生我一個碩大無朋的鼻子，就不能引起異性們的注意了嗎？所以儘人家嗤笑爲壽頭壽腦，他竟施展着全身風流解數，獵取「熱女郎」的紅膩的櫻唇。有志竟成！難怪他以伽薩諾伐第二百店了！</p>

<h3>廿世紀快車（Ｔｗｅｎｔｉｅｔｈ　Ｃｅｎｔｕｒｙ）（四）</h3>
<p>— 文蔭</p>
<p>麗蓮此次從詩家谷到紐約，中間還遇到一個小波折。有一位年輕富家了，呌喬治，史密斯的，他在詩家谷曾經在麗蓮身上化過不少錢，這次亦竟跟了她到紐約去。麗蓮起頭覺得他很有意思，處處顯得他體貼小心，是個多情的公子。久而久之，他漸漸想干涉麗蓮的一切行動了。有一天他在一本戲劇雜誌裹，他看到了一個捧角者的一篇文字，說麗蓮情人衆多，幾有面首三千之槪。那位多情公子看了，竟認眞起來，拿了那本雜誌去質問麗蓮，因此麗蓮漸漸就覺得他討厭了。這時亦正是這位喬治在尋根問底，細細研審麗蓮的時候，忽然有人敲着包房的門，麗蓮未免爲之一喜。等到門開了，始看見奥麥來站在門口，向她獰笑着。他很不客氣地喊着她道：哈囉，你這個小鬼頭，小本那特（歐洲著名女　伶）好嗎？」麗蓮亦笑道：「哩，你這高首加入·誰放你到這車上來的？」奥麥萊道：「你還不知道哩。我們正爲你的事，天都鬧翻了。麗蓮突然打了一個寒噤·連忙問道：「你們都是誰？」奥麥萊故意刁難道：「你猜吧。」麗蓮已經明白了。她問道：「難道歐斯卡·吉甫亦車上嗎？你快吿訴我呀？」她竟高聲喊起來了。奥麥萊指着外面道：「就在隔壁。那個拿破侖又從莫斯科回來了。他的頭上盡是血，但是一些沒有低。」喬治·史密斯聽到這裹，突然跳起來道；「哦，原來是吉甫。怪不得你要呌我下車哩」！麗蓮狠狠地釘了他一眼·啐道：「胡說！我怎麽知道他在車上的？我還要謝謝你們吿訴我哩。」她又掉轉頭，怒氣冲冲地對着奥麥萊道：「我是不去見他的。我是自由了、亦决不放棄那自由。吉甫先生將我看輕虐待，已有三年之久。說了我許多不好聽的話······他自命是我的斯溫加里（「魔愛」中以一位名女伶的創造者而兼丈夫的人）。斯溫加里！好吧，你回去吿訴那不要臉的斯溫加里，說他要是餓死了，我亦不見得去看他一眼。我希望他還是餓死了嗎！奥麥道：「麗蓮，你怎麽這樣說話呢？他不是你的創造者嗎？」麗蓮狂呌起來了：「他是我的什麽？你給我滾出去！······莎弟！」她四處尋她的侍女。「莎弟那裹去了？」喬治跳了起來道：「你不用尋莎弟。這件事交給我好了。」他於是對着奥麥萊道；「滾！」他其勢洶洶地走向奥麥萊。奥麥萊祇可聳了聳肩膀，退了出來。麗蓮於是站了起來，伸直了兩隻臂膊。他知道那是最有效的方法，她在舞台上幾年的經騐得來的。她哭道：「爲什麽他們總要這樣對我？他們當我是什麽做的？鐵做的？儘着拿鎚子來鎚我······無論我走到什麽地方······他們都跟來了！」她將自擲到喬治的懹裹，哭得像小孩子似的。喬治一時被她感動了，將她摟得緊緊的。其實呢，同樣的做作，亦曾在舞台上感動過台下的全部觀衆，使他們人人爲她而掉涙哩。（未完）</p>

<h3>Yin Tong Already Passed Qingdao Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is rumored that Yin's mission this time has two purposes: Japan is actively carrying out economic aggression. (Beiping) Chai Shan telegraphed the embassy in Beiping, reporting that at 4 PM on the 21st, he departed from Changchun to Dalian to await a meeting with Yin Tong and will return to Beiping at the end of this month. Gu Mengyu may postpone his return to Nanjing and does not wish to express his opinion to the outside world. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Yin Tong arrived in Qingdao at 1:30 PM on the 22nd aboard the Dalian Maru. He suddenly urged a hasty departure. Reporters visited Yin's relatives and friends everywhere, all of whom said they had not seen him. It was not until 5 PM, when the ship was about to weigh anchor, that he returned to the original ship to go to Dalian. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Dongbao newspaper reported that Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, went to Dalian on the 21st aboard a Japanese ship and may transfer to Changchun to discuss the North China issue with the Kwantung Army and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Shan, the military attaché at the Japanese embassy in Beiping. It is said that Mr. Yin has two missions: 1. To negotiate the abolition of the North China Truce Agreement within a short period of time; 2. The North China issue, which was previously negotiated with the Kwantung Army, will henceforth be negotiated with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The above two items are the result of negotiations between Mr. Yin and Huang Yingbai, and acting Foreign Minister Wang also gave them active support. (United China News Agency telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng visited Yu Xuezhong this morning to report that he has sent Yin Tixin to Malanyu to prepare for the takeover. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong said that the Tanggu Truce is purely military in nature, and most of the contents listed therein have been fulfilled, so there is no question of abolishing it. Although we had the intention to abolish it last time, we had verbally discussed it with the Japanese, but because the Japanese side indicated that it was too far from the topic, it was immediately abandoned. Recent reports about the Dalian and Tianjin meetings are, as far as I know, still premature. If the Tanggu Truce is to be abolished with conditions, it would be better to retain it unconditionally, which must be considered. As for the rumors that I will attend the meeting, I have no knowledge of it. The saying that Yin Tong is going to Dalian is only seen in the newspapers. I have not heard when Huang will come north. However, if there is a meeting in the future, Dalian would be suitable. Military Attaché Chai Shan's visit to Changchun this time is purely for consultation and exchanging opinions with the Kwantung Army, and there is no so-called overall contact. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In order to promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the Japanese side intends to expand the organization of the Beiping Mantetsu office. At the same time, Hayashi Yata, the vice president of Mantetsu, has internally decided to appoint Sogawa, the former director of Mantetsu, as a consultant, who will represent the Japanese side with full authority in handling all matters related to economic cooperation. Sogawa has already held earnest talks with powerful figures in the North China administrative authorities twice and will come to Beiping again soon. The Japanese side plans to invest specifically in economic development. The commercial department of the Mantetsu Co., Ltd. will move a part of it to Beiping. According to sources in embassy circles, the Japanese side, after the railway was opened, immediately prepared to promote a Far Eastern economic cooperation that would integrate everything. The content includes: 1. Enlisting representatives from the Chinese and Japanese financial circles to form an investigation committee to investigate the resources in North China that are sufficient for development; 2. Making banks such as the East Asia Sino-Japanese Industrial Co., Ltd., the Industrial Bank of China, and Huaye Bank, as well as special bank groups such as the Colonization Bureau of Korea, and all groups investing in China, form a unified operation; 3. Using the cash recovered from the settlement of old debts to set up new projects; 4. Developing new economic areas and investing in projects in a way to obtain concessions.

<p>(Beiping) Regarding various negotiation issues in the war zone, Chai Shan, upon receiving a telegram from the Japanese General Staff, went to Changchun to meet with the leaders of the Kwantung Army to discuss them. Concrete measures have been discussed for important issues such as the rotation of the security forces in the war zone, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the various passes of the Great Wall, and the return of Eastern Hebei. Chai Shan recently telegraphed Beiping, stating that he had left Changchun for Dalian to await a meeting with our representative, Yin Tong, to discuss everything. After Yin Tong went south to meet with Huang and Tang Youren this time, he instructed Representative Yin to conduct preliminary consultations on matters relating to negotiations in the war zone. Yin has already secretly left Shanghai by ship and will arrive in Dalian the night after tomorrow. The Kwantung Army headquarters has also dispatched Colonel Miyazaki to represent them and come to Dalian with Chai Shan to participate. Yin Rugeng and Lei Shourong are currently staying in Beiping. Whether they will go to participate at that time is unknown. Huang has not sent a telegram yet. Tao Shangming went to Yuguan a few days ago to visit Yi Wo to discuss matters within the Luan-Yu area and is staying in Yuguan and has not returned. Regarding the entire approach to North China diplomacy, Huang had a plan in mind when he went south and submitted it to the central government for approval and implementation. At the Dalian Sino-Japanese representative meeting, if the Japanese side can treat each other with sincerity and follow the events that should be fulfilled according to the Tanggu Truce, and reach a concrete level of negotiation, Xiong Bin will be able to go north to participate as a representative and resolve everything. According to those familiar with North China diplomacy, there are currently nine places along the Great Wall where Japanese troops are stationed. According to the Tanggu Truce last year, they should have withdrawn outside the Great Wall line. However, the Japanese side has repeatedly delayed on the pretext that there are no houses outside the passes for the troops to station in. Up to now, the troops stationed at the various passes are still in the stage of military preparation, and their military uniforms and actions are also different from those of regular troops. The withdrawal issue is feared to be difficult to realize. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong is carrying Huang Fu's instructions and is scheduled to attend the meeting on the 25th. This meeting does not focus on formality but on practicality, so there will be no ceremony. What the Japanese side intends to propose for discussion is the issue of our establishment of customs at the Great Wall. What our side intends to propose for discussion is: (1) the return of Malanyu; (2) the withdrawal of the Kwantung Army from the various passes of the Great Wall; (3) the crackdown on illegal activities of Japanese and Korean vagrants in the war zone; (4) the transfer of Liu Zuozhou and Zhao Lei's troops out of the war zone for reorganization; (5) the eastward expansion of the newly formed special police force in the war zone. The Japanese side will have Okamura, the deputy chief of staff of the Kwantung Army, as the center of the deliberations. Chai Shan's trip to Changchun is only responsible for conveying our intentions and will not participate in the meeting. Yi Wo is still in Changchun and will attend the meeting. Although the outside denies that Tao Shangming went to Changchun, Tao did arrive in Changchun as early as the 20th and is staying at the Yuexiangcun Hotel at the railway station.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>America's Unmatched Naval Plan Wild</h3>
<p>According to news from our newspaper yesterday, the initial naval talks in London have come to a standstill. Furthermore, Japanese naval warlords are demanding complete freedom from treaty constraints. Consequently, US Secretary of the Navy Swanson has reiterated the government's plan to build a navy of unmatched supremacy. It is reported that the US Navy's large-scale aircraft construction plan has been approved and will soon commence. If peaceful negotiations fail, the great powers will undoubtedly hasten their preparations for war. At a time when the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly grave and our country's national defense is extremely hollow, we have good reason to pay close attention to America's so-called plan to build a navy of unmatched supremacy.</p>
<p>America's unmatched naval plan is essentially aimed at Japan's demand for naval equality. This plan is contained within the Vinson Act, which was passed by the US Congress several months ago. The plan can be divided into three points: one is the construction of warships, two is the addition of aircraft, and three is the increase in personnel. If implemented according to the plan, by 1942, the United States will have 200 brand-new warships, 2,184 aircraft, and 105,000 naval officers. The new ships include battleships, cruisers with 8-inch and 6-inch guns, six aircraft carriers, 97 destroyers, and 36 submarines. This does not include warships that are over age but still usable at that time. With such a large and unparalleled navy, Britain and Japan will not be able to compete.</p>
<p>Since President Roosevelt took office, the naval faction has greatly expanded its power. Everyone knows that the reason for this lies in Japan's ambition to break the balance of power in the Pacific with its expanding influence in the Far East. Previously, Congress had already passed an expansion plan, but it was not large in scale, and the construction funds for some of the ships had not yet been approved. After the Vinson Act was passed, the United States finally decided to add 102 new ships. More notably, this plan stipulates the method of replacing warships that have reached their age and the addition of aircraft on warships. Although the number of warships is in line with the London and Washington treaties, the number of aircraft far exceeds what they have now. As for the implementation of the plan, it will be carried out once every five years and will be fully completed by 1941.</p>
<p>The cost of implementing the plan is estimated at between 380 million and 600 million US dollars. If next year's naval conference yields no results, Congress will allocate funds annually to ensure that it is fully completed. This year, Congress has already allocated 25 million US dollars, which does not include the navy's annual shipbuilding costs. The increase in aircraft is 1,184, with a total cost of 95 million US dollars. According to the US Navy authorities, each cruiser will carry six aircraft, which will be increased from six to twelve in wartime. The number of personnel will also increase annually. The United States currently has approximately 80,000 naval personnel, and this year's Congressional budget has already added 85,000 people. Now, let's briefly mention the existing strength of the major naval powers. The United States has a total of 84 official active warships, most of which are giant ship types with large guns and are suitable for sailing in the ocean. Britain has 137 warships, and Japan has 166. In terms of strength comparison, the United States is the strongest. This is because the coastline of the United States is not as far as that of Britain, and the tonnage of the US Navy exceeds that of Japan. The United States has 52 warships under construction, Britain has 47, and Japan has 47. Based on the proportions set in the London and Washington treaties, the United States still needs 102 ships, and Britain still needs 61 ships to meet the quota, while Japan has already met the quota. The Vinson Act was created to build these 102 warships. US naval authorities say that after this plan is implemented, the principle of Anglo-American equality can be translated into reality, but the trend is still to surpass Britain.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinson said: "Although the current naval strength of the United States is sufficient to protect the security of the country, it is still insufficient for the purpose of protecting overseas territories and trade rights without this plan. The goal is to protect the country's policies and commerce, and to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States is unimpeded. Using the navy to safeguard world peace is the only feasible way." Looking at this statement, the foreign policy attitude of the Roosevelt government can be clearly understood. Roosevelt is a pragmatist and does not value empty talk, but pays attention to the strength of power. His approach to Japan is not to talk about the rights and obligations of treaties, nor to mention the principles and techniques of diplomacy, but to use the large navy as his mouthpiece. This is why the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is gradually feeling difficult, and why Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito is frequently traveling back and forth across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident, countries have become increasingly disillusioned with the slogans in Geneva, and the belief that might makes right has become stronger with each passing day. Our country's national defense has no plan to speak of. At a time when all the great powers are actively preparing for war, we are still not thinking about preparing and are trying to linger on in the midst of mediocrity. Looking at China and the outside world, how can we not feel awe?</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Plans</p>
<h3>To Open New Arctic Sea Route</h3>
<p>Parallel to the Siberian Railway, with Major Military Value (Washington) Observers here believe that the 9,000-mile sea route that the Soviet government plans to open in the Arctic Ocean, parallel to the Siberian Railway, can connect the Soviet industrial center with the eastern border, which is of great military value. This plan was announced by the Russian explorer Schmidt, who is currently en route from Alaska to Moscow, passing through here. He is the leader of the Salyuskin expedition that was rescued by plane in the Arctic Ocean in March of this year and has been recuperating in Alaska. Schmidt said that the last voyage has proven that this route is passable and can be navigated every year from July to mid-October. This sea route can reduce the distance from Leningrad to Vladivostok by half. Twenty-five radio stations and weather stations have already been set up along the route by the last expedition. This year, he plans to conduct another trial voyage, which can be increased to 40 stations. Several airfields have also been established. Schmidt is reluctant to discuss the use of this sea route in detail, but says that large ships can pass through, so transportation is very important, and it can make it easier to transport products from the major rivers in the Arctic region. However, military observers believe that the Soviet Union's sudden development of this sea route, along with the concentration of large armies in Vladivostok, the addition of double tracks to the Siberian Railway, and the large-scale immigration to eastern Siberia, make the unspoken meaning easy to predict.

<h3>Longitudinal Railway in East Border Area</h3>
<p>Bridging Duoshidao to Connect Korea and Manchuria, Aiming at Russia and Coping with the Righteous Army (Dalian) According to Mantetsu news, in order to suppress the righteous army for the war against Russia, and to develop military industries and raw materials such as gold, silver, iron, lead, and coal in the East Border Area, the Kwantung Army and Mantetsu are actively planning to open a longitudinal railway in the East Border Area. Mantetsu sent the director of the local office, Nagashima, to investigate, and there is already a concrete plan. At the same time, they are investigating connecting ports, and it has been determined that Duoshidao in the lower reaches of the Yalu River is the most suitable. Duoshidao is the only ice-free port. Mantetsu is also negotiating with the Government-General of Korea to build a new railway bridge connecting the Korean and Manchurian railways, which is planned to begin construction next year with a cost of 6 million taels. The railway bridge will also be located in Duoshidao. The current railway bridge between Andong and Sinuiju will be scrapped due to its age. (United China News Agency telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Landing of American Planes Becomes a Problem</p>
<h3>Britain Prohibits Landing in Newfoundland</h3>
<p>The United States Prepares to Take Retaliatory Measures (Washington) Yesterday, London announced that only aircraft belonging to British Imperial Airways have the right to land in Newfoundland, Canada, when flying across the Atlantic. Yesterday, American Pan American Airways held informal consultations with the State Department on this matter. American Pan American Airways has been unable to obtain the right to land in Newfoundland, preventing the crossing of the Atlantic. This matter was previously discussed at the British Embassy in the United States, and the embassy said that there was no discriminatory treatment against American airlines. However, yesterday's London declaration contradicted this. Although the State Department has not yet decided on any measures, it may take retaliatory measures, such as not allowing British aircraft to land in the United States, for example. We still remember that several years ago, France prohibited the aircraft of American Pan American Airways from landing on Martinique (in the Atlantic), a French territory. In retaliation, the United States prohibited the postal aircraft of the French ship "Ile de France" from communicating between the ship and the port of New York. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>British Acting Prime Minister and Secretary of War</p>
<h3>Forcefully Defending Air Force Policy</h3>
<p>Neighboring Countries Increase Military Spending, Britain Feels Threatened, Desires Peace but Dares Not Lag Behind (London) Recently, the British government's new policy of expanding the air force has become the target of criticism. Not only the opposition Liberal and Labour parties are completely opposed, but even within the Conservative Party, some have criticized it. Therefore, Conservative leader and acting Prime Minister Baldwin, as well as Army Minister Hailsham, delivered speeches today to explain the government's plan and motivation for increasing the air force, in order to dispel general doubts. Baldwin said in a speech at the New Ayrshire conference in Scotland, roughly, "Britain's increase in air defense is neither due to the government's nervousness nor due to the government's desire to engage in war. There is nothing more urgent at the moment, and our desire for peace has not diminished in the slightest. My personal belief is that this action of ours will not only not increase the difficulty of our attempts to reduce armaments, but will also reduce its difficulty. As we have seen, the League of Nations has been greatly weakened. One or two permanent member states of the Executive Yuan have left the League of Nations, while other member states have adopted a detached attitude. I can only hope that this is a temporary phenomenon. Most countries are now increasing their armaments. In the past twelve years, the German political situation has completely changed. In view of the above facts, it is not difficult for us to draw a conclusion, that is, we must increase our air force armaments. However, I am by no means disappointed in limiting armaments. We must do our best to cope with the difficult situation so that the goal of limiting armaments can be achieved. This is what I must declare." In addition, Army Minister Lord Hailsham delivered a speech at the St. Helens Hall in Lancashire, forcefully defending the air force policy, with the same intention as Baldwin. Hailsham said in his speech, "Britain has weakened its position to the extreme limit of danger. It can be seen that Britain has indeed set an example of military reduction. However, today we can no longer be satisfied with the current situation. Some hypocritical pacifists often advise people that if Britain completely disarms, it will inevitably lead to universal peace. I cannot believe this. If we declare now that under no circumstances will Britain participate in a European war, it is tantamount to trying to cause a European war. If we declare to all countries in the world that no matter what kind of aggression we suffer, we will never think of rising up to defend ourselves, then I can guarantee that within a few months, we will be attacked by other countries. Outside the Three Islands, no one doubts that we have any aggressive ambitions, and no one can make this speculation. But if everyone knows that Britain has made plans for self-defense, then the guarantee of world peace and Britain's freedom from aggression will be more solid than this."

<p>Warsaw Foreign Minister Beck will go to the capital cities of Estonia and Latvia on July 23rd. This matter was originally just a diplomatic courtesy, but now it has developed into a major political relationship because it is related to the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. According to reports, the Baltic countries occupy a considerable position in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and Estonia has made important reservations about this pact and its effectiveness. Therefore, we believe that when the Polish Foreign Minister meets with the authorities of the two countries in the capital cities of Estonia and Latvia, he will definitely discuss the so-called Eastern Locarno Pact extensively.

<p>(Tokyo) The remarks of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are as follows:</p>
<p>The establishment of the new India-Japan treaty this time is not only a matter of trade relations, but also a matter of great significance from the overall perspective of British, Indian, and Japanese relations. Some Japanese citizens are quite dissatisfied with the treaty, but the spirit of mutual concession between Indian and Japanese officials and civilians has solved difficult questions and contributed to the increase in trade. We have to say that this is a valuable gain. India, the United States, and China are all important markets for Japan, and Japan is a customer of India second only to the United Kingdom. This time, both sides have restored normal treaty relations and established trade relations, which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the future development of trade.

<h3>Japanese Goods Shipped to Honolulu Encounter Difficulties</h3>
<p>Osaka Regarding the reading of the Japanese country name, there was originally no consistency. Some read it as Nihod, while others called it Nippon. For foreign countries, it has always been commonly referred to as Japan in English. It was decided by the Ministry of Education's National Language Research Committee that it should be referred to as Nippon in the future to achieve unification, and this case was reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All official documents issued by Japan to foreign countries should use this term, and all Japan words should be abolished and not used again. However, the Honolulu Japanese Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the 21st, saying that recently, Japanese goods shipped to Hawaii did not have the prescribed "Made in Japan" mark, but were printed with p "Made in Nippon." The number of such commodities is gradually increasing, and the US customs office there believes that this violates customs laws and requires a fine of 20% of the original price or urging them to return the original goods. The Chamber of Commerce is negotiating with the customs authorities. (Nichi Ren dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>US-Russian Debt</p>
<h3>Negotiations Reach a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Will Be Held in Washington (Washington) The State Department announced today that the preliminary US-Russian debt negotiations will be resumed next week. This is the result of consultations between Secretary of State Hull and Russian Ambassador Troyanovsky. It is said that next week's talks are only a preparation for formal negotiations in the future. Previous negotiations in Moscow have repeatedly failed, so that all the promised restoration of business relations after the United States recognized the Soviet Union have not yet proceeded. The Russian side is now eager to resolve the debt issue as soon as possible, so that it can use loans from the US Export-Import Bank to purchase huge amounts of goods in the United States. An American bank for lending to Russia has already been established, but due to the provisions of the Johnson Act, the US government is not allowed to raise new debts for countries with outstanding debts, and all debts from the Russian imperial era and the Kerensky era have not been repaid, so the bank has not been able to implement loans.

<h3>Tree Planting to Prevent Drought</h3>
<p>Total Area of 20 Million Acres Requires an Expenditure of 75 Million Yuan (Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order on tree planting to prevent drought on July 11, which was only announced today.

<h3>Former Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Detained</h3>
<p>Nakajima Sophistry Denies Bribery Facts Prosecutors Initiate Compulsory Disciplinary Action as an Exception (Tokyo) Nakajima Kumakichi, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry, who was summoned to the Public Prosecutor's Office for the third time yesterday, underwent a severe interrogation by Prosecutor Biwada for as long as six hours. As a result, at 4:30 pm, he was transferred from the Public Prosecutor's Office to the Preliminary Examination Court. After being detained and interrogated by the Preliminary Examination Judge, he was taken to the Ichigaya Prison at 8:40 pm. When Nakajima was summoned on the 21st, he, like the previous two times, insisted that he had not received any bribes. That is to say, there are many inconsistencies between the number and amount of stocks he received and the statements of other related parties. Therefore, the Public Prosecutor's Office failed to obtain his confession. However, according to the statements of related parties, the fact that he, while holding the position of Minister of Commerce and Industry, allowed the listing of stocks in the issue caused by the Okura incident and received 10,000 yuan in cash and hundreds of shares of stock as a reward has become clear. Chief Prosecutor Tachi visited Chief Prosecutor Hayashi, reported the progress of the trial of Deputy Prosecutor Hirata and Director Kimura of the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, and stated that they had to adopt administrative detention. In addition, in the bribery cases that have continued to occur in recent years, many celebrities have been indicted by the judicial authorities, such as former Minister of Railways Ogawa, former Minister of Education Kobashi, and high-ranking officials with extremely high status, all of whom were detained at the time of prosecution. However, there has never been a case where someone was detained by compulsory disciplinary action before being prosecuted. This is the first time for former Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima. This move is a precedent for crimes committed by high-ranking officials. This is a manifestation of the prosecution authorities' recognition of this as a major event and their adoption of a cautious attitude. Moreover, the fact that Nakajima has been summoned three times proves his stubborn denial of the crime. (Dentsu dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Damages Suffered by the Japanese Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The recent long-term strike by dockworkers in various ports on the American Pacific coast, especially the unprecedented general strike in San Francisco, has caused considerable damage to Japanese merchant ships and mail ships. According to investigations by various companies, the direct losses have already exceeded two million yen. Among the Pacific coast ports, only Los Angeles did not participate in the strike. All others have formed a united front to achieve their goals. Consequently, companies such as Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, Daitoh Kaiun, Yamashita Kisen, Mitsui &amp; Co., and Kawasaki Kisen, which transport timber, wheat, and other goods, have been unable to load or unload cargo due to the strike. In addition, the delay in loading has increased insurance costs, and some cargo has even had to be transported back to its origin. Since May, for two and a half months, the losses of Nippon Yusen and Osaka Shosen alone have reached six or seven hundred thousand yen. When combined with the losses of Daitoh, Yamashita, Mitsui, Kawasaki, and other companies, the total direct damage is estimated to be between 1.3 and 1.4 million yen.

<h3>The Meeting of the Heads of State of Germany and Italy in Venice (German Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Germany is displaying its skills in flexible diplomacy, while Italy is striving for skillful and comprehensive policies. Hitler is advocating for equality in armaments, with the intention of breaking through the Versailles system. Unfortunately, his diplomatic skills are not very sophisticated. Abroad, he has lost even Austria's sympathy, and the goodwill from Italy is lukewarm at best. Moreover, various sectors within the country, even within the National Socialist Party, are expressing discontent and criticism toward the Hitler government. First, there is a clear division between the left and right wings of the National Socialist Party within the Sturmabteilung (SA), the foundation of his power. If this festers, it could lead to the danger of the National Socialist Party splitting itself. Second, the working masses are suffering too much oppression, and the sentiment of resistance is gradually expanding. Although Hitler's administration has claimed to have re-employed four million unemployed workers in the year and a half since taking office, their living conditions have not improved. If disaster strikes, it could easily put the current government in the most dangerous position. Third, there is a revolutionary danger arising from the conservative forces centered around the National Defense Force. The leadership of the German National Defense Force is in the hands of Prussian landowners, who have long held many grievances against the National Socialist Party. They want to strike from the right. The anti-Hitler atmosphere is gradually intensifying, and although they may not be the first to revolt, it is enough to contribute to the instability of Germany.</p>
<p>Due to the above factors, it is very difficult for the Hitler government to find a way out domestically. The last resort is to use diplomatic means to shift the focus of its citizens and enhance Germany's position. However, the high-sounding rhetoric has already been exhausted, and relations with Poland have also changed. Only pursuing conciliatory diplomacy with Italy is beneficial to Germany. At the same time, the Italian Blackshirt Prime Minister proposed inviting German Chancellor Hitler to Venice for a visit to exchange views. Hitler gladly accepted this opportunity and, on June 14th, accompanied by Foreign Minister von Neurath and more than a dozen attendants, took two large aircraft from Munich in southern Germany to Italy. Led by Italian aircraft, they arrived at the San Nicolò airfield, where Mussolini was waiting to greet Hitler. After shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries, amidst public cheers and heavy military security, they traveled by car to the water city of Venice. After resting briefly at the Grand Hotel, they went to Mussolini's luncheon at the Villa Pisani. After the meal, the two dictator prime ministers held secret talks in another room, without the participation of a third person. The content of their discussions was kept secret and only stated in a joint statement they issued on the 15th that "the prime ministers of Italy and Germany have completed discussions on general policies, especially on the examination of various issues directly related to Italy and Germany, in a sincere and cooperative spirit, and the personal relationship between the leaders of Italy and Germany will continue in the future." The more important point here is that they mentioned that their "personal relationship will continue in the future." As for the specific content, it is still unclear. However, according to someone close to Hitler, an informal statement was released on the evening of June 15th, stating that "the scope of the two prime ministers' meeting was very broad and of a general nature. As a result of this meeting, no documents were exchanged, so it will not have a significant impact on the European political situation. Now that the two prime ministers have reached a mutual understanding, it will be reflected in the political situation in the future. The German government will definitely not immediately return to the League of Nations, and there is no concrete decision on the issue of disarmament." According to general observation, the meeting between the Italian and German prime ministers actually has two more important meanings. One is regarding the issue of Eastern Europe, which includes the relations between the countries in the Danube River basin with Italy and Germany. At the same time, it is also a point of divergence for the victory or defeat of the German-French struggle. Furthermore, there is the diplomacy towards the Soviet Union. Italy and Germany have different interests in this regard, which can easily lead to conflicts. The other issue is Austria. Originally, Germany had the ambition to annex Austria. At the same time, it is difficult for Austria to exist as an independent country and is willing to merge with the German people who share the same language and culture. However, if the merger is successful, Germany's power would expand, which would be detrimental to France and would also be somewhat harmful to Italy. Therefore, the two prime ministers of Italy and Germany agreed to maintain Austria's independence. There is also a supplementary common diplomatic strategy, which is to oppose economic alliances, or in other words, to break France's hegemonic movement. The second is to resist individual agreements with Eastern European countries by the Soviet Union. After the talks concluded, Hitler flew back to Germany again on the 16th. (Berlin, June 17th)</p>
<p>China-Netherlands Economic and Commercial Relations (Correspondence from The Hague)</p>
<h3>Jin Wensi's Speech at the China-Netherlands Association</h3>
<p>At the annual meeting of the China-Netherlands Association on May 5th, Jin Wensi, the Chinese Minister to the Netherlands, delivered a speech stating, "I thank the chairman for his welcoming speech and the association for hosting a banquet tonight. When I was first appointed as envoy to the Netherlands, I eagerly anticipated shaking hands and conversing with the members of your association. However, my duties confined me to my home country until today, when my wish has finally been fulfilled. Now that I can gather with you all and speak to those who have expressed sympathy, my heart is filled with joy. Although I have only been here for nine months, I have been in constant contact with Dutch society during those nine months, and I know that the Dutch people have sympathy for my country and my people, which is a great comfort to me. I am now honored to have been asked by the chairman to speak, but I do not wish to bore you with a lengthy speech on the current political situation in China. Regarding the political situation, I would like to quote the words of your country's envoy to China, Mr. Oudendijk. When Mr. Oudendijk returned to the Netherlands, he gave a speech at a meeting in Apeldoorn on March 6th, expressing his views on the general situation in China. If my translation is correct, Mr. Oudendijk's words were as follows: Mr. Oudendijk said, 'China is currently in a state of turmoil, which is inevitable during a transitional period for a country.'"</p>
<h3>Recent Image of Jin Wensi</h3>
<p>"Elephant," these words were spoken by Mr. Du at the time. I believe that when Mr. Du said these words, he genuinely possessed empathy and trust. Now, regarding Mr. Du's words, I still feel there's a need for further interpretation. I dare to cite Dr. Wellington Koo's words to supplement them. It was on November 21, 1932, when the League of Nations Administrative Council was holding a meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue of Japan's invasion of our country's territory. Mr. Koo was the representative of our country, presenting our country's position to the council. Representative Koo's words are as follows:</p>
<p>"China, in recent times, has transformed from an old empire of four thousand years into a modern republic, undergoing many difficulties and disturbances, which are well known to students of political history and are unavoidable in political reform. These facts are not surprising. In fact, the various disturbances presented on the surface of the country are actually a kind of active phenomenon after the awakening of the nation, which is clear evidence of the progress of 450 million people in transforming the country. The phenomena in the process of China's transformation may have some unpleasant aspects, but how are they different from renovating an old house?"</p>
<p>I have only these few words regarding China's political situation. Now, I shall immediately proceed to the main topic of tonight's speech, namely, whether there is a possibility of increasing the economic and commercial relations between China and the Netherlands. I believe that you all have a definite interest in this issue, but in order to study this issue with accurate observation, it is inevitable to first list certain facts to show the current efforts of China to promote economic improvement, and what its trends are. However, I want to declare that I am doing this not with the intention of propaganda, because I am neither a propagandist, nor do I feel any deep interest in propaganda work. Therefore, in my paper plans, I will not mention anything, but only bring to your attention certain facts that, in the near future, will constitute an important element of our country's revival. I will now briefly mention one or two of these facts to inform you. First, let's talk about railways. The plan of the central government is to lay several new lines and complete the extension of the existing railway sections. Therefore, in the north, the Longhai Railway line will be extended from Tongguan to Xi'an. This section is about one hundred and ten kilometers long and will be open to traffic by the end of this year. In the south, there is the unfinished section of the Yuehan Railway, about three hundred and eighty kilometers long, which has now started construction and can be completed in three years. However, I would like to add that some people do not approve of the extension of the Longhai Railway, but it is a generally recognized fact that the extension will increase the revenue of the entire line, thus increasing the value of the entire line. In addition to the above two important extension projects, the plan that I consider more important is the railway network plan connecting the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Hunan in the Yangtze River basin. This line is estimated to be about one thousand and two hundred kilometers long, passing through important cities such as Wuhu, Zhapu, Hangzhou, Nanchang, and Pingxiang. Wuhu is the center of the rice-producing area, Zhapu has been designated as a major port in the East, Hangzhou is the capital of Zhejiang Province, Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province, and Pingxiang is located on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces and is a coal-producing area. Some people think that this railway network plan is difficult to realize, but in fact, the section from Hangzhou to Jiangshan on the border of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, about three hundred and fifty kilometers long, has most of its capital raised by local bankers, and the project is undertaken by domestic engineers. This section was opened to traffic four months ago, and the other sections of this railway network have also been started in order. The progress of railway planning is quite remarkable, and the progress of other transportation construction is also commendable. In recent years, the whole country has been working very hard on road construction. Even in remote provinces, those who used to use sedan chairs, mules, and livestock as transportation tools are now replaced by buses and heavy trucks. Next, let's talk about civil and commercial aviation. Although the aviation enthusiasm of our Chinese people is not as high as that of Europeans and Americans, the development of the aviation industry is also worth mentioning. Therefore, in terms of aviation trunk lines, Shanghai can be the center, with four major trunk lines to Beijing in the north, Guangzhou in the south, Chengdu in the west, and Dihua in the northwest, totaling about eight thousand and two hundred kilometers. Except for the Lanzhou-Dihua section, all have been opened to traffic. When the situation in Xinjiang is promising in the future, the Shanghai-Dihua section can be further extended to the northwest to connect with the Soviet Union and other lines in Europe. Furthermore, the line from Beijing to Guangzhou, about three thousand kilometers long, was also opened to traffic a few days ago. Next, let's talk about the shipping industry. The business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been significantly improved recently. At the same time, the old ships of the company have been repaired. Speaking of the radio station, there are already many radio stations built and under construction in the country, so that the sound between the mainland of China and the remote provinces is more sensitive. In addition, for the purpose of transmitting news with various places abroad, including the Dutch East Indies, in the past five years, no</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>H&gt; (Shen Bao Second Sheet)</p>
<p>Less than twelve radio stations have been built. Furthermore, there are also several things worth mentioning in terms of agriculture and industry. In order to improve distribution, the control measures for food, cotton, and coal are being strictly tried. We are also trying to improve the silk, tea, and fishing industries. In addition, important industries, such as the organization of steel plants and machine factories, are also starting to make beneficial preparations. The above points are the main points of my new industrial development plan in China. This new plan has limited scope and location, and is far less grand than other plans, and is easier to implement. It is currently being implemented item by item. I have just told you the detailed situation in order to give you a clear impression of how China is working hard today on the necessary preparations to seek economic revival. However, the impression I gave you is by no means complete, which I admit. In short, China is advancing slowly and steadily on the path of industrialization. The items that China needs today and in the next few decades are production items, such as airplanes, merchant ships, cars, railway materials, port construction materials, tap water materials, electrical appliances, radio parts, and all other machine materials. Therefore, you can now understand what the actual needs of China are, and on the other hand, how to expand the market for Dutch goods in China, and how to increase the economic relations between China and the Netherlands. Unfortunately, since the mutual market between China and foreign countries, the part of China's foreign trade occupied by the Netherlands has always been small and not important. You know more about this than I do, so there is no need for me to describe it in detail. What I want to say is that, taking 1933 as an example, the percentage of China's import trade occupied by the Netherlands is only 0.79, which is far less than 2.08 percent of your neighboring countries, such as Belgium, and 7.95 percent of Germany. Furthermore, the percentage of the Dutch East Indies is 5.84, while the British territories adjacent to the Dutch East Indies, such as Australia, the Malay Peninsula, and British North Borneo, are 7.55 percent. Your country's industry is not unworthy of pride, but in my country's market, your country's industrial products are either relatively rare, or even non-existent. How is this different? Please try to give one or two examples to illustrate this. About a month ago, I went to A City to visit the Fokker Aircraft Factory and the driver's North Airport. When I visited, I saw the Gannet aircraft, which was famous for traveling between A City and Java on Christmas last year. I was fortunate to see it, but looking back at the aviation lines in China, I have not heard of a Fokker factory aircraft. At the same time, I also went to Scatam to visit the Werdun Shipyard, which is one of the greatest and most complete shipbuilding industries in the world, but I do not remember that this factory has ever built a ship for the Chinese government or Chinese shipping companies in China. Furthermore, in the Aint Flower Place, there is a famous Philips Electrical Materials and Radio Manufacturing Factory, but what is disappointing to you is that in the past year, the electrical materials transported by Dutch to China only accounted for 1.6 percent, and radio only accounted for 3.8 percent. I can't give many examples, but I don't want to waste words. I only ask you to think about the reasons why the trade between the Netherlands and China is so small. On the other hand, although it is important to encourage import and export trade, it cannot be said that all efforts have been made to increase the economic relations between the two countries, because our country not only needs the products that the Netherlands can supply, but also welcomes the technology of the Netherlands and the surplus capital of the Netherlands. The current trend in China is to gradually focus on making the most of existing technology and existing capital to complete production undertakings. However, I can declare that this trend does not exclude foreign investment and the employment of foreign experts and engineers. You know that the Netherlands, at least, has one kind of engineering undertaking that can make an extremely valuable contribution to me, that is, water conservancy and port construction engineering. The Netherlands is most famous for building dikes, dredging rivers, irrigating, building ports, and building ports, which are also one of the urgent tasks of our country today. Since ancient times, our country has regarded water control as one of the most important problems, which is exactly the same for both of our countries. Your country has been helping my country at any time in the above undertakings, which is really appreciated by us. I now hope that in the near future, for the benefit of both parties, this cooperation can continue to increase. What I want to say is that the Dutch Port Construction Company, which is run by your chairman, is currently engaged in an important port construction project on the eastern road of the Longhai Railway, which can be cited as gratifying. Regarding foreign investment in China in the future, I really do not want to talk about it, but I can tell you that our country is doing its best to use domestic capital to operate construction undertakings. Although this is the case, our country still welcomes foreign investment. As for the current accumulated railway debts, the Chinese government is currently proposing a reorganization method, and the Longhai Railway debts are also included in it. If you say that all railway debts can be paid off, I dare not say, but the fact is that several debts that have expired have been paid off. Now that I have said this, I did not want to bother you with details, but I must think about what the actual methods of reorganizing road debts are for you, so please take the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo roads as examples. As far as I know, the method of reorganizing foreign debts on both roads is to withdraw a certain percentage of the daily business income of the two roads as a special fund for reorganizing foreign debts. The amount withdrawn was 10% of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road and 5% of the Beijing-Shanghai Road. Since last year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road has increased to 20% and the Beijing-Shanghai Road has increased to 7.5%. In this way, the monthly special fund can accumulate 170,000 silver dollars. As for the roads built with foreign debts, whether this method is currently implemented, or whether it is applicable, I do not know. What I want to point out is that all methods of reorganizing railway foreign debts seem to be worth mentioning. I mentioned the issue of cooperation between China and foreign countries in the form of investment or in the form of technical assistance, and Japan has recently made a statement, the content of which is known to you. If I do not say a word about this statement at this time, I am really not sincere to you, but I think I should ask you to pay attention to the practical comments made by one of the important newspapers in the Netherlands, the New Rotterdam Newspaper. The evening newspaper on April 23 of the newspaper contained a comment as follows, "Now Japan is really crazy. It is fortunate if there is still no major impact this time. Japan's policy is like a rudderless boat, letting the wind and waves sway, giving a major danger to the safety of the route." My personal opinion is that although the danger on this route is serious and has a tendency to turn sharply downward, it will eventually disappear sooner or later, because other sailors can allow this serious danger to continue to exist without trying to eliminate it. Moreover, history records that this kind of rudderless boat is either forced to set the rudder or sinks itself by touching the reef, and there are not enough examples of its kind. Therefore, in my view, we are now studying how to make the cooperation between China and the Netherlands in technology or investment closer, and we do not need to panic because of Japan's statement. Moreover, the cooperation between China and the Netherlands, like the cooperation between China and the League of Nations and the cooperation between China and other friendly countries, is non-political in nature and is dedicated to assisting China's construction undertakings, so my view has its reasons. Now I still return to the topic, the relationship between China and the Netherlands, its nature is economic and</p>
<p>Commercial relations. For the sake of maintaining and developing this relationship, it is better to cultivate a spirit of goodwill, and a spirit of mutual understanding of each other's aspirations and difficulties. For three hundred years, all events between China and the Netherlands and between the two major ethnic groups of China and the Netherlands have been guided and dominated by this spirit, which can be cited as a deep consolation. I deeply believe that all issues concerning the residence, trade, and legal occupations of the people of China and the Netherlands within each other's territories, especially the status of our Chinese in the Dutch East Indies (please allow me to pay special attention to this issue), both China and the Netherlands have a spirit of sympathy, goodwill, and mutual understanding, and my trust is shared by you. At the conclusion, I would like to explain that regarding Mr. Du Beck's proposal to organize a Sino-Dutch group at the meeting on March 6 to implement the economic and commercial relations between the two countries, I think it is meaningful. Moreover, this proposal is intended to make both Sino-Dutch capitalists invest. According to Mr. Du's view, this method can provide a new and beneficial guarantee for the current debt and future investment. This proposal is even more meaningful. I would like to ask you to pay attention to another proposal. According to this proposal, a group should be organized, not only the representatives of the interests of both China and the Netherlands, as its organizational members, but also the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies should participate. I think this proposal is also worth considering. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Sino-Dutch Association will promote the research of various beneficial proposals, and consult with the competent officials of both China and the Netherlands to implement them, in order to increase the interests of both parties.

<h3>1,500 Japanese Officials</h3>
<p>=Adopt Japanese-Based Administrative Officials to Reorganize Pseudo-Organization Agencies=</p>
<p>Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on the 16th that, in order to reorganize its state organs, Manchuria "Guo" is recruiting a large number of Japanese-based officials, and its expenses have been included in the (pseudo) Kangde first year's budget. Endo, the director of the General Affairs Department of Manchuria, who returned to Japan this time, is in contact with the Japanese government for this matter. In addition, the Director of the General Affairs Division of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of Manchuria "Guo" also left Changchun on the 16th to return to Japan, and Endo and the Japanese government negotiated on the following types of talents: (1) 1,000 Japanese-based police officers, (2) because Manchuria "Guo" decided to reform the local system on December 1 this year, adopt 300 Japanese-based administrative officials (that is, serve as the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Minister of Police, and local affairs officials, etc.), (3) in order to enrich the local accounting system, adopt 100 Japanese-based accounting officials and allocate them to various counties, totaling 1,500 people. It is now heard that the case has been started by the army side to contact the central government, and once negotiated, it will establish identity protection according to the personnel system,</p>
<h3>Serious Drought in Gan Province</h3>
<p>=Continuous Days Also Suffer from Wind Disasters, the Losses Suffered Are Even Greater=</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, the drought in Gan Province has been more than a month, not a drop of rain has fallen, and the fields and grains in the counties are all withered. The counties that have reported drought have been eight or nine counties. It is now learned that the provincial government and the provincial relief committee and other agencies have received a report from the counties of Xinjian, Linchuan, Nanchang, Fengcheng, Yangxi, and the Special Zone Political Bureau, reporting drought documents, roughly that the county has not received rain, has been more than a month, the water in the streams and swamps has long been dried up, the fields and grains have no water to irrigate, and all of them are withered. It is estimated that the harvest in a bumper year will be difficult to have a hundred-ten hopes. If there is no rain, then the early and late rice fields will become a red land, and there will be no harvest,</p>
<p>In recent days, the haze has been dense here, and there is a summary of the mountain rain coming, but unexpectedly, the clouds and haze soon dispersed, and it is still a sunny day. Only on the 16th night did it begin to drizzle a few drops, but suddenly a strong wind descended yesterday (20th), flying sand and stones, and pedestrians dared not open their eyes. The farmland and rice fields have been withered, and this wind disaster is especially devastating. According to the old farmers, if it does not rain, in addition to the early Hunan (valley name) because the maturity is relatively late, it is difficult to hope for a harvest, the rest can still save half of it. Now that this wind disaster has been suffered, the valley will not be solid, and it is difficult to hope for three-tenths of it. Therefore, the price of grain and vegetables has been increasing. The recent changes in rice prices, the three-machine late rice a week ago, only needed eight yuan and four corners per stone, and in less than three days, it rose three corners, to eight yuan and seven corners. Yesterday, there was another surge to nine yuan. The average common people complained endlessly. Gan Province is an agricultural area, and its output is mainly valley rice. Now that the drought has become a reality, and the farmers are in a state of helplessness, they want to use superstition to save the disaster, there are those who build a jiao to pray for rain, there are those who ban slaughter and abstain, and there are those who carry out idols in the hot sun, such as Xu Jingyang of Xishan Wanshou Palace in Xinjian, and Chen Yu of Luoshan in Fengcheng, have all been down the mountain for more than ten days, and the crowd who have been going to Xishan for incense and rain for days is no less than the abolished August. The farmers' desire for rain can be seen from this (July 21).</p>
<h3>Record of Inspecting Bandit Areas in Southern Jiangxi (2)</h3>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: We, after being sheltered at the Catholic Church and temporarily separated from the dreadful summer night, boarded a car southward at half past five the next day (the 17th). Low mist enveloped the mountains, and the morning sun rose. Passing Nanfeng, we saw pillboxes dotted in the suburbs, among which one was the tallest. The square in front of the building was a public cemetery with ornamental columns, an altar, and a low wall. This was the burial ground for those who had sacrificed their lives due to bandit disasters over the years. Circling around Nanfeng city, we continued southward. The driver seemed reluctant and said, "The road ahead is newly built, uneven, and difficult to drive on. Moreover, my legs feel like they are in a fire pit, which is really unbearable." Because our destination was Guangchang, and if we were late, we wouldn't reach Jiujiang by the 19th, we encouraged him to proceed while also instructing him to be careful. Along the way, we saw that nine out of ten houses were empty, with only the frames or dilapidated walls remaining. The fields were barren, and the mountains were bare. Most of those traveling along the road were troops being mobilized. There were often semi-circular cave holes dug into the mountain walls, all made to avoid airplanes when the bandits had not yet retreated. Around noon, we arrived at Guangchang city. Luo Zhuoying, the commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army and commander of the 18th Army, led his troops to welcome us in the suburbs. After resting, we set out on foot to inspect the battlefield. To the north of Guangchang, Yangmian Ridge served as a screen in the back. On April 28th of this year, the Third Route Army of the Northern Route attacked the ridge and its western Changyin area. The main force of the bandits was the entire First, Third, and Fifth Army Corps. They engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat, and the battle was fierce. Eventually, the Central Army gained control, with over four thousand bandits killed or wounded and over a thousand officers and soldiers also killed or wounded. Although the battlefield had been cleared, new graves were numerous and mostly shallowly buried. The lingering rain and humid wind caused the stench of corpses to rise, a truly horrific sight. The county government was located in the northeastern corner of the city and was set ablaze by the bandits when they left. The ruins were automatically converted into a park by the engineering corps. The county seat was washed into a plain by large and small floods during the Qing Xianfeng period. Only the main hall of the Confucian Temple stood alone in the square, now renovated by the Eighth and Seventy-ninth Divisions and converted into an airfield. The Jiaokeng area west of the city, with its complex terrain, was a vital strategic location for Guangchang. The bandits had built pillboxes and defenses, which were quite elaborate, but all were flat with tunnels to defend against airplanes. The National Army has now built strong pillboxes on the highest ground, the Sanguan Temple, and the Shunhua W坞 area. From there, the undulating mountains and hills are in plain view. After the National Army recaptured Guangchang, the front line reached Baishui Town. The Guangchang-Baishui road has been under construction by the army since the 16th. When the bandits left, the city had over two thousand women left behind. Half of the strong men were coerced into going south with the bandits, and half have now escaped back. Many have also died. The entire county originally had only 110,000 people, and now nearly one-third will be gone. Hundreds of refugees flee from the front every day. As the army advances, the front line becomes the rear. Those who have homes to return to immediately go home. Those whose homes are in the bandit areas have no choice but to stay and be supported. Currently, the refugee shelter houses over four thousand people, mostly from Ningdu, Shicheng, and Ruijin. They arrived alone, without clothes or food. The shelter provides assistance as much as possible, but with limited funds, there is more gruel than monks, which is quite difficult. Half of the escaped refugees were driven out by the bandit areas due to food shortages to reduce the burden of the old and weak. This shows the internal urgency and unease. Half are strong men who could not bear the bandit's orders and had to escape. When we visited, we personally saw two newly arrived refugees who had died on the road, a heartbreaking sight. Commander Luo said that deaths occur every day. "We have seen it countless times. If you hadn't seen it yourself, you wouldn't know that such a hell exists on earth." We listened to his words and were saddened for a long time.</p>
<p>Luo is from Guangdong and graduated from the Baoding Military Academy. He is short, lean, and competent. His uniform is no different from that of the soldiers. After guiding us through the inspection, we went to the command post. We had been running under the scorching sun for over ten miles and felt suffocated, dizzy, and sweaty. Wiping our sweat with our sleeves, the sleeves were completely wet. After resting, we talked with Luo again. Luo said, "What we are fighting the Red Bandits for is the people, and the land is secondary. We are fighting for the people's support, not for their physical obedience. There are three major categories of people in the bandit areas. The first category is what we call local ruffians and gangsters, and what the bandits call the proletariat. The bandits use them, organize them, and give them privileges, using them as henchmen and trusting them as confidants. These local ruffians and gangsters are abandoned by the government but treasured by the Red Bandits. When the National Army recaptures an area, these people would never dare to return and would definitely flee far away with the bandits, remaining their die-hard followers to the end. Fortunately, merchants are considered the bourgeoisie by the Red Bandits. Those who could escape have already fled to other places. Those who couldn't escape suffered in the bandit areas. After the army recaptures an area, they still choose to live temporarily in safe areas and do not rush to return. The third category is the good people who farm during farming season and work as laborers during leisure time. They are the most numerous. They are compliant everywhere. They are at peace with the National Army when it comes, and they dare not resist when the Bandit Army comes. They are the purest and easiest to manage. But although they do not hate or resist, they have an unspoken and unmoving support in their hearts. Now, the people that the Central Army and the bandits are competing for are not the local ruffians and gangsters of the first category, nor the landlords and business owners of the second category. What we are fighting for is the support of the hearts of the majority of good farmers and good workers. In the past, the National Army's disadvantage was partly due to the lack of pillboxes and roads, making it materially impossible to guarantee the already acquired land for the people. On the other hand, it was because the generals failed to pay attention to the work of soothing the people's hearts."</p>
<p>Later, Fan Songfu, the commander of the Seventy-ninth Division, introduced a former Red Bandit company instructor to meet with us. Jiang Wenyu asked him about the situation in the bandit camp. Jiang (asked): What is your surname and name? Where do you live? (Answer): My surname is Ying, I am 22 years old, and I am originally from Hunan. (Asked): Have you studied? (Answer): I studied at primary school for two years. (Asked): When did you join the Communists? (Answer): When I was 18 years old. (Asked): What work did you do when you first went? (Answer): I was a soldier. (Asked): What are the duties of a company instructor? (Answer): To manage the affairs of the company. (Asked): Does the company commander take your instructions? (Answer): No. (Asked): Do you understand their party ideology? (Answer): Not very clearly. (Asked): Who do the Communist bandits worship? (Answer): Lenin. (Asked): Is Lenin Chinese? (Answer): No, he is Russian. (Asked): What is the treatment of a company instructor? (Answer): 1.2 jiao for food per day. (Asked): Why did you surrender? (Answer): There was nothing interesting in their place. (Asked): How did you come? (Answer): I ran away during the battle. (Asked): Did you come alone? Did you bring a gun? (Answer): There were five of us, and we brought five guns. (Asked): Do the Communist bandits have a capital? (Answer): Yes, in Ruijing. (Note: Ruijin has been renamed "Jing"). (Asked): Are there airplanes in the bandit area? (Answer): No. There used to be two, but they were shot down and cannot fly now. (Asked): Do you have a family? (Answer): Yes, parents and a wife. (Asked): Can you communicate with your family in the bandit area? (Answer): No. (Asked): Can you communicate now? (Answer): Yes, but there is no reply to my letters. (Asked): When did you get married? (Answer): At the age of 18. Have you been married in the bandit area? (Answer): No. (Asked): Do your superiors often talk to you about the party? (Answer): No. (Asked): Do you talk to the company and platoon about party ideology? (Answer): No. (Asked): Are there any benefits to the Communist Party? (Answer): The benefits they talk about are all lies and cannot bring people true benefits. Instead, they make people suffer.</p>
<p>We rested until around 4 PM and then bid farewell. Before leaving, Huang Renzhi and Jiang Jianyu sent a telegram to the Shanghai Local Association, requesting them to send medicines worth over a thousand yuan and two or three Western doctors to the front line to meet the urgent needs of the refugee shelter and for epidemic prevention. After we said goodbye to Luo and Fan, we drove off, increasing speed. We encountered rain along the way and arrived in Nanfeng at dusk. We entered the city and were hosted by Mao Bingwen, the garrison commander of Feng, and lodged in the church. This county was occupied by bandits last year, but the city was not breached. Therefore, all four city gates had extremely strong pillboxes. Now that the front line has moved over two hundred li away, it is a safe area, so the transportation task is particularly important. The north-south dimension of the city is shorter, and the east-west dimension is slightly longer, so Nanfeng city is also known as the Qin (zither) City. It is the hometown of the ancient writer Zeng Gong. The entire county has a population of 110,000, and the education budget is less than 30,000 yuan. The next morning (the 18th), we got up at dawn and hired a car to go north. Before nine o'clock, the car had arrived in Nancheng. We rested in the Catholic Church again. At nine o'clock, the head of the county education bureau, Cheng Yunhuang, invited Huang and Jiang to give a speech to the primary school teachers. Gu Zhutong, the commander-in-chief of the Northern Route, hosted a tea party and gave a welcoming speech, discussing the world situation. At eleven o'clock, we shook hands goodbye and boarded the car, returning directly to Nanchang, arriving around 4 PM (the 21st).</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Major Robbery in Ruanxiang Town</h3>
<p>Ruanxiang Town in Punan is a relatively prosperous market. Nearby villages and rural residents get their daily necessities there. The town is located at the border of Songjiang and Fengxian counties. However, the streets are under the jurisdiction of Fengxian, so a police station is established. At about 5 PM the day before yesterday, fifteen bandits, all speaking the local dialect, first rushed into the police station, robbed three guns. Then, a man wearing a blue cloth short coat and holding a carrying pole led a crowd into the home of Tang Yisheng, the richest man in the town, and searched and robbed jewelry, beads, gold ornaments, cash, and other items, worth about five to six thousand gold. Then they went to Xu Caizhang's silk shop and robbed valuable silk and cloth, worth about a thousand gold. Dasheng Sauce Garden and Houtai Grocery Store also lost several hundred gold each. In total, six families were robbed in this incident, which lasted about two hours. Before leaving, they fired shots to intimidate. By the time the police chief of the police station reported to the Zhuangjia Xing branch station and led the police to rush there, the bandits had already fled far away.</p>

<h3>Farmers Continue Transplanting Rice Seedlings Due to Continuous Rainfall</h3>
<p>This area has been suffering from a long drought, with no rain for two months. The drought has become apparent, and farmers are extremely anxious. Most of the rice seedlings have not been transplanted. The authorities are urgently trying to remedy the situation. Local gentry and other people have set up altars in various places to pray for rain to comfort the farmers. Since the 19th, there has been continuous rainfall, and the water level has risen sharply. On the 21st, there was even heavier rain, and the tide rose secretly, measuring about a foot. The fields can now be irrigated. The autumn harvest may increase relatively. However, the towns of Tangqiao and Tianzhuang in the west and Liantang and Yangjian in the south have not yet received rain. However, there is a dense cloud cover, which seems to indicate rain. The various Dragon Kings in the urban area have been sent back separately.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>Grand Parade of Earth Gods</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 22nd), the various Earth Gods of Suzhou held a joint parade. At 11 AM, they first went to Yuandu to offer incense, and then paraded through the major streets. Afterwards, they went to the copper Guanyin statue at the Shaobao Lian Temple to thank for the rain. The procession stretched for over ten li. The Qianjie Street was crowded with 100,000 people who braved the rain to watch. The spectacle was unprecedented. The procession included over three to four hundred arm gongs, arm incense, flower pots, and stone locks, as well as stilt walkers, dragon lanterns, and various Peking Opera performances, bull gods, and snake monsters, all competing for novelty and uniqueness. At 2 PM, Wen Tianjun and the Eye Sight Controller met in the middle of the street, passing each other on the left and right on Qianjie Street. For a moment, the viewers were dazzled. The restaurants and hotels along the street tripled their business.</p>

<h3>Merging of Townships and Towns to be Completed by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The county government held its 54th district chief meeting yesterday. Chairman Yan, the county magistrate, resolved: 1. Before the budget for each district for the 23rd year is drafted, the payments will be temporarily made according to the table. After the budget is drafted, it will be handled based on this table. 2. The merging of townships and towns in each district must be completed and reported by the end of this month. 3. Due to the drought in the paddy fields of the county, it is not suitable for planting. It seems that the funds for purchasing buckwheat should be transferred to rent machine boats and distributed to each district to relieve rice seedlings. 4. More and more joint dam construction and water lifting are seen in various villages. The county will subsidize drought relief funds. The rest of the cases are omitted.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<h3>High Court Orders Surveying and Reconstruction of Prisons</h3>
<p>Luo Wengan, the Minister of Justice Administration, came to Changzhou to inspect the courts and prisons. Considering the prison houses to be too small, he believed that it was necessary to expand them. He ordered the county court and the county government to find land for construction. It was initially planned to survey and determine the site of the Xicang base outside the West Gate to be used for constructing prisons. However, because the land had been purchased by Jiangsu and Shanghai banks to build warehouses, it was abandoned. The Suzhou High Court issued another instruction to Cui Yungong, the president of the county court, stating that to rebuild the prisons, he should immediately meet with the Wujin County Government to survey the base, draw up a map, and submit it for review and transfer.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee Compiles the Budget for this Year</h3>
<p>In order to improve sericulture and leaf production in this province, the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee was established. Previously, the Construction Department drafted the committee's organizational charter and operating expense budget, which were successively resolved and approved by the provincial government in each case. Since its implementation, Wuxi and Jintan counties have been designated as sericulture model areas, and Wujin, Liyang, Jiangyin, Yixing, Danyang, Yangzhou, Jiangdu, Jurong, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, and Wujiang counties have been designated as sericulture improvement areas. Various unified management methods have been formulated. This spring, cocoon line control was first implemented in the districts where it was set up, and silkworm seed control will also be implemented starting this autumn. As the business is expanding day by day, the original organizational charter and operating expense budget are no longer applicable. Now, at the beginning of the 23rd year, the Construction Department is revising the committee's organizational charter and compiling the budget for the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement expenses for the 23rd year. The total annual expenses of the Sericulture Improvement Committee are estimated to be 1,714,400 yuan, administrative expenses are 28,200 yuan, and business expenses are 36,600 yuan.</p>

The bandit suddenly retracted his confession. Because the victim did not arrive, the hearing was adjourned for continuation.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<h3>Two Guilds Request Abolition of Tea Banquet Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu Banquet Industry Guild and the Teahouse Industry Guild, etc., argued that since the merchants have already paid business tax, they must also pay the tea banquet tax, which is an unbearable burden of double taxation of the same nature. They telegraphed the Jiangdu County Party Department, which telegraphed the province, requesting that it be included in the case of harsh and miscellaneous taxes and that it be abolished by decree to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<h3>Gale Passes Through, Canal Water Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>In recent days, this county has had continuous rain, and the weather has turned cooler. The average temperature is around 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

The water level in the canal also rose a lot.</p>
<h3>Reporters' Guild Sets Date for Re-election</h3>

<p>The Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with the county magistrate's order to investigate whether it is feasible for merchant Hong Shouqi to report on the establishment of a national goods market, specially submitted it to the fourth executive committee meeting for discussion. It was decided that the inland commerce is declining and cannot withstand foreign humiliation. The silk cloth and general merchandise guilds will submit documents to the association to request assistance from the county. On one hand, the association will send members to the county to present their suffering in person. It was also learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Circulating National Goods Market has been discovered in the city streets. Yang, the patrol officer of the first branch office, telephoned the Chamber of Commerce to inquire whether the market was registered with the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce denied it and has reported it to the higher authorities for review and decision.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Rice Shipped Out of Province</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Rice Price Evaluation Association has held two or three meetings recently. Rice merchants have requested price increases, but party representatives attending the meeting have prevented them. Therefore, the current market price of rice is only 8.3 yuan. However, according to investigations, more than 20,000 dan have been shipped out of the province in recent days. The authorities have not yet taken any action to prohibit it. It is expected that the price of rice will increase sharply within days.</p>

<p>This city received a little rain a few days ago, but the eastern countryside has not received any rain. The weather is unusually dry, and all the crops are withering and dying. Seawater suddenly invaded, reaching Yingfangkou yesterday. Ports such as Tuixiagang and Wuxinggang have now built dams to prevent salt water. The people there are panicking. If there is no heavy rain in the next ten days or so, the salt water will enter the city.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<h3>Hurricane Passes Through, Rice Fields Untouched</h3>
<p>After three hours of torrential rain in Xiaoshan at about 9 AM on the 19th, the fields were sufficiently watered. However, the river water is still extremely dry. The ships in the four villages cannot return to their original state. At 1 PM on the 20th, a strong northeasterly wind suddenly arose, with flying sand and rocks. Countless telephone poles and street sheds were blown down. It gradually subsided at about 6 PM. The weather was extremely bad. However, the weather turned cooler, and the rice seedlings were not seriously damaged.</p>
<h3>Farm Woman Hangs Herself Due to Drought-Stricken Field</h3>
<p>In Jinjiabang, outside the East Gate of Xiaoshan, there was a farm woman, Jin Cao, whose husband died early. The twelve mu of farmland left by her husband had been maintained by his wife, who hired workers for sowing. Unexpectedly, there is a severe drought this year, and the wages are one yuan for two workers, and she has nowhere to hire. There are also six mu of Neisaka farmland that cannot be sown due to lack of water. Jin Cao was originally a woman and had nowhere to hire people. She could not bear to see her yellow seedlings wither and die. She went to the Benpu Temple to ask the gods for rain. Unexpectedly, the fortune she received indicated that there would be no rain. On the evening of the 18th, she threw herself into the ring and hanged herself. She left behind two children and a 70-year-old aunt who cannot make a living. The situation is very tragic.</p>

<h3>Tang Youren Talks</h3>
<p>Yin Tong's Mission to Dalian = Meeting with Kwantung Army Leaders; Location Determined in Dalian's Commercial Zone; Unfinished Negotiations May be Resolved on the Spot; Yin Tong, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, who was tasked with negotiating various outstanding matters in the war zone with the Japanese side, met with Vice Minister Tang Youren and others last Friday. After discussing the direction of progress on the issues in North China, he took a steamer from Shanghai to Dalian the next morning to meet with the Kwantung Army leaders and begin negotiations. A New News Agency reporter visited Mr. Tang Youren to inquire about Yin Tong's mission on this trip. He was told that Yin's trip was to rush to Dalian to meet with the Kwantung Army leaders. The location was in Dalian, not Changchun. The Kwantung Army leaders or their responsible representatives would rush to Dalian from Changchun at that time. The reason being that in relation to the various outstanding negotiations in the war zone, such as the entry of the new security forces in the war zone, the withdrawal of troops from Malanyu, and the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants, the Japanese side has repeatedly failed to comply with the agreements. Yin's trip is to inquire about everything from the other party. Furthermore, the discussion with me was also about this matter. I instructed him to proceed with caution, not seeking merit but seeking no demerit. Therefore, if the opinions of the Japanese side are close, there is a possibility of resolving the matter on the spot. ×××××</p>
<h3>Hurricane Passed Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Force Was Very Weak, and There Were No Losses on Land or Water; North-South Shipping Lanes Resumed Normal Operations Yesterday; According to a report from the Observatory yesterday, the hurricane landed the night before last and swept across western Shanghai around 1 AM yesterday, heading north between Zhenjiang and Nanjing, then turning north-northeast into the Jiaozhou Bay area of the Yellow Sea, with a force of four and a center of about 60 nautical miles. When it passed western Shanghai, it was in the middle of the night, and the force was very weak. The area of western Shanghai did not suffer any losses. The climate in this port was cooler yesterday, with a high of 80 degrees. Fine rain fell before 2 PM, and the sky cleared at 3 PM. The number of people suffering from heatstroke in various infectious disease hospitals has almost disappeared. Since the height of summer, no true cholera has been discovered.</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs hoisted a black warning ball at 5 PM the day before yesterday. It was lowered yesterday morning. The Shanghai-Ningbo liners Xinjiang and Tianning Xing, considering the hurricane to have passed, left port for Ningbo at 5 PM yesterday. The Xin Beijing and Xin Ning Shao, which were supposed to open from Ningbo to Shanghai, the day before yesterday, Xin Beijing came as usual from Ningbo the day before yesterday and imported yesterday morning. Xin Ning Shao, the Shanghai line ordered to suspend navigation to avoid danger, heard that it had also opened from Ningbo to Shanghai yesterday. As for the more than ten ships that came to Shanghai from Nanhua during this hurricane, they sheltered from the wind in the bay and could all set sail yesterday and should continue to import today. Ships from Shanghai that were exporting yesterday all exported as usual.</p>
<p>Fire Brigade</p>
<h3>Gradual Suspension of Drought Prevention Work</h3>
<p>Wu Hengru is Called to Beijing; After the severe drought in this port, there have been continuous days of rain. The rural farmland, after the active relief efforts of the Drought Prevention Association, and the sudden timely rain, the rice can be worry-free, and the farmers are all comforted. According to news from the Drought Prevention Association yesterday, there have been occasional showers in the past few days. The amount of water in the farmland is sufficient. The fire trucks sent by the Fire Brigade have temporarily stopped working. Once the weather clears and the farmers need them, they can be sent again at any time. However, the most difficult thing is the economic problem. Each fire truck requires about 60 yuan of gasoline and other expenses per day, which is very large and difficult to afford. In addition, the drought-relief association has purchased eleven water pumps, which have been distributed to various villages for application. Therefore, the borrowing of fire trucks will only be done when the weather is too dry and the water pumps are not sufficient. It is also known that Wu Hengru, the section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau of the Association, went to Beijing the night before last in response to a call to participate in the Disaster Relief Association to make a statement on the matter of Shanghai purchasing foreign rice to stabilize the rice price, which has now been approved to purchase 500,000 stones.</p>
<p>With Timely Rain, the Rice Fields Recover</p>
<h3>No Need to Purchase Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Inland Rice Merchants Send Letter Requesting Suspension of Ordering to Benefit National Rice and Save the Endangered Countryside; Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been hot, and there has been a severe drought without rain. The rice seedlings in the farmland are all withered, and the rivers and ports are shallow, resulting in a shortage of rice from the inland and rising rice prices, leading to a panic over people's food. Rice merchants in this city have suggested ordering foreign rice and requested the government to exempt import taxes to prevent famine. However, there have been several days of timely rain, and the rice seedlings are expected to recover. Whether or not to order this foreign rice has attracted the attention of the general public. The Takung Pao reporter specifically visited to inquire yesterday. The record is as follows:</p>
<h3>Ordering Foreign Rice No Longer Necessary</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Dagon Society, wanting to understand whether foreign rice orders had been finalized and their exact quantities, specially visited rice merchant Mr. Zhu Zixiang to inquire about the truth. According to Mr. Zhu, the association had previously suggested purchasing 500,000 *shi* (a unit of dry measure) of foreign rice as a comprehensive measure because of the soaring rice prices at the time, to prepare for any eventuality. At the same time, considering the interests of farmers, although the total amount was tentatively set at 500,000, it was not a one-time order. The plan was to order 100,000 *shi* first, and if rice prices had stabilized and foreign rice was no longer needed, it would be stopped immediately. Furthermore, it was also proposed that the market price would be based on the cost. However, outsiders, not understanding the truth, suddenly became suspicious. Therefore, in order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, the association plans to convene a meeting of its members in the near future to rescind the previous proposal and request the government to find a solution. As for the previous surge in rice prices, as I have said, it was not due to a shortage of rice, but because the rivers and harbors in the rice-producing areas were dry, making it impossible to transport rice to Shanghai. Because the arrival of goods has been scarce in recent days, the market is particularly active, and prices have naturally increased. Shanghai is a gathering place for rice and grains, not a rice-producing area. The rise and fall of rice prices depend entirely on the arrival of goods and consumption. Because Shanghai rice merchants act as agents for customers, unlike rice merchants in the interior who rely solely on stockpiling. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of this, wants to stabilize Shanghai's rice prices. Stockpiling alone will not be enough. Therefore, there are regulations to encourage stockpiling. However, rice merchants have not dared to try it until now, firstly because there are no good warehouses to prevent the stored rice from spoiling, and secondly because public opinion is agitated once rice prices rise. However, according to the current situation, it seems that there is no need to order foreign rice. *Dongxin* rice will soon be on the market, and new *xian* rice samples are not far off. Although the drought is a cause for concern, it has rained in recent days, and Jiangsu Province has many rivers in low-lying fields, which can still be remedied. However, Zhejiang and Anhui are indeed slightly damaged, but they will not be completely devastated.</p>
<h3>Inland Rice Merchants Express Opposition</h3>
<p>The Lilli Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, opposing the order of foreign rice, saying, "Dear Sirs, while the current rice prices are unusually high, it is certainly appropriate to order foreign rice to make adjustments. However, it is not known to you that the current soaring rice prices are not due to the scarcity of domestic rice, but due to the prolonged drought, shallow rivers, and difficult transportation. Farmers are busy with field irrigation and have no time to sell rice. It is only speculators who take the opportunity to buy and sell, resulting in even more hoarding. If once there is abundant rainfall and the rivers rise, the market will immediately return to normal. If you do not carefully consider the situation and rashly order foreign rice, it will not only fail to help the rural areas, but will instead accelerate their demise. Recalling the flood of twenty years ago, it was also due to the order of foreign rice that domestic rice prices plummeted, causing harm to both merchants and farmers. If this measure is taken again this time, domestic products will inevitably be greatly affected. Moreover, rural areas are already on the verge of crisis, how can they withstand another blow? Furthermore, this year's grain harvest in Jiangbei is abundant, as is Hunan. Larger towns in Jiangsu, Changzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Xiashi still have surpluses that are said to be sufficient to last until the ninth or tenth month of the lunar calendar, when the late rice is harvested, which will be even more than enough. And in the rural areas, the basic stock is also about 20-30%. As for the rice seedlings in our inland areas that cannot be planted, the low-lying areas are only about 10-20%, and even the high-lying areas are only about 20-30%. Moreover, the seedlings are very strong and beautiful, and if rain comes, it will not be considered a disaster. We believe that you and others may still have a gap in understanding the situation in rural areas and cannot see through it. Therefore, for the sake of rural areas and for the sake of domestic products, our colleagues cannot remain silent. Therefore, we submit this general overview, and we hope that you will adopt our humble opinion and immediately withdraw the order of foreign rice to benefit domestic rice and save rural areas. We would be extremely grateful." Addressed to: Chairman Gu of the Bean and Rice Industry Association.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways to Jin Cheng Bank and Others</p>
<h3>Borrowing 30 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The collateral is 12 million yuan worth of land in Hankou for the purchase of materials. The Ministry of Railways is borrowing 30 million yuan from Shanghai banks to reorganize the Pinghan Railway, with the land of the Pinghan Railway in Hankou as collateral. Detailed arrangements are being negotiated. Shanghai banks have decided to form a syndicate to handle the loan. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Loan Principles Decided</h3>
<p>Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, and Zhou Zuomin, General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank in Shanghai, negotiated a loan of 30 million yuan to reorganize the Pinghan Railway and designated the land of the Pinghan Railway in Hankou as collateral, with a term of six years. Among them, 12 million yuan will be used to purchase materials from foreign countries, guaranteed by the bank. The loan principles have been decided, and specific arrangements are being negotiated. Generally, it is expected to be successful.</p>
<p>Reversing the Huge Trade Deficit</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Plans to Develop Overseas Markets</h3>
<p>=The International Trade Bureau has drafted a detailed plan=</p>
<p>=The China Export Company is sending personnel to Southeast Asia to promote sales=</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that due to the sluggishness of China's industry and commerce, all industrial products rely on imports. At the same time, the export of domestic silk, tea, and other products is declining, resulting in an alarming trade deficit. In view of this, the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry is urgently seeking ways to remedy the situation. Since Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo returned to China last month, he feels that developing trade with Southeast Asia is even more urgent. Therefore, he immediately drafted a detailed plan to effectively promote domestic goods abroad in order to reverse the huge amount of money exported each year. Recently, the China Industrial Products Export Company dispatched personnel to Southeast Asia to promote domestic goods. They set off on the 18th. The Shenshi News Agency reporter has explored and recorded the various situations as follows:</p>
<h3>The Main Reason for the Trade Deficit is the Sharp Decline in Exports</h3>
<p>China's annual trade deficit is very large, reaching 700 million yuan last year. In the first half of this year, foreign trade in Shanghai alone has a trade deficit of over 200 million yuan. It is expected that the national trade deficit will exceed 300 million yuan. The main reason for the trade deficit is the encroachment on the overseas market for domestic goods and the neglect of our foreign promotion. For example, silk and tea were originally China's major products, but in recent years they have plummeted. The total number of silk exports last month was only 2,802 bales, worth 788,840 yuan. The same is true for tea exports. Although exports last month still amounted to 3,588,072 yuan, the sales of Chinese tea in Southeast Asia are sluggish due to the impact of Japanese tea, accounting for only 20-30% of the previous volume. If remedial measures are not taken immediately, Chinese tea will inevitably disappear in Southeast Asia in the future. As for eggs and egg products, they have also become China's main rotating exports in recent years. However, due to the strict import restrictions imposed by various countries, exports have also decreased significantly. Last month's exports of egg products amounted to only 1,599,288 yuan. Egg manufacturers in this city have already requested assistance from the Ministry of Industry and requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly negotiate with various countries to maintain the egg industry.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Plans to Develop Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Since Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo returned from his inspection of Southeast Asia last month, he immediately felt that the Southeast Asian market urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, he ordered the International Trade Bureau to discuss detailed measures with the Shanghai business community. At the same time, the Ministry of Industry is also planning to help the egg producers who have requested assistance. As for the International Trade Bureau in this city, not long ago, it introduced British and American merchants to directly purchase domestic products for sale in Europe and America, which is much more convenient than the indirect trade through foreign firms in the past. It is said that the results are quite good. It is planned to continue this in the near future. In addition, since the situation of Chinese tea's disastrous defeat in Southeast Asia is so serious, the International Trade Bureau plans to order tea merchants to pay close attention to this matter in order to regain the overseas market.</p>
<h3>Chinese and American Business Communities Promote Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Products Export Company, organized by the Chinese and American business communities in this city, specially collected products from various factories, totaling 150 types, for public display on the 16th, inviting people from all walks of life to visit. On the 18th, personnel were dispatched to various ports in Southeast Asia, carrying goods to promote sales. It is said that if the results are satisfactory, it is planned to send more personnel in the future.</p>
<h3>Organizing a Syndicate to Handle the Loan</h3>
<p>Zhou Zuomin, General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank, decided to organize a syndicate to handle the Pinghan Railway loan. He has been in contact with various banks in Shanghai for days to join the syndicate and determine the amount of the loan. It is said that the banks being contacted are Yanye, Dalu, Zhongnan, China, Jiaotong, and Zhejiang Xingye. Once the negotiations are successful, the syndicate will sign a loan contract with the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<h3>Negotiating the Purchase of Materials</h3>
<p>Among the loan, 12 million yuan is used to purchase materials from foreign countries, guaranteed by the bank. The Ministry of Railways has also been in contact with the foreign firms undertaking the project. The materials include 500,000 railroad ties, 90,000 tons of steel rails, and machinery required by the railway's engine factories, as well as long-distance telephone lines. Once the loan is successful, a contract will be signed with the undertaking foreign firms, guaranteed by the loan syndicate.</p>
<h3>Reorganization to be Completed in Five Years</h3>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency has learned that the Ministry of Railways' reorganization of the Pinghan Railway includes (1) the entire line's tracks, (2) repairing the Yellow River Railway Bridge, (3) adding equipment to the entire line's engine factories, and (4) installing long-distance telephones throughout the line. It is scheduled to be completed in five years. Initially, it was planned to issue 30 million yuan in public bonds with an interest rate of 6%, and then mortgage the public bonds to the banking industry. It is said that the issuance of public bonds has been suspended and changed to borrowing from banks.</p>

Chu Huiseng was elected as the chairman.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>After the formalities were completed, the chairman reported on the recent decline of the silk industry and the purpose of the meeting. Then, the following resolutions were made: (1) The closing time will remain at 6:00 PM as originally scheduled. (2) Wages will be paid according to the existing standard, with each foreman's wage calculated at 38 cents per day. After the discussion, the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi joint meeting was held, and the following resolutions were made: (A) Request the relevant government authorities, financial circles in this city, and silk factory associations to jointly organize a Silk Cocoon Evaluation Committee to stabilize silk prices. (B) Elect Jiang Laixian, Zhang Jifang, and Shen Yichen as representatives to contact all parties separately. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>British-American New Factory</p>
<h3>Workers Resumed Work This Morning</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau ordered police protection to prevent accidents. The Support Association of Various Circles in this city announced its dissolution. Dagon News Agency reports that the closure of the old factory by the British-American Company in Pudong caused a strike by workers at the new factory, leading to a serious labor dispute. After two months of stalemate, the Party and government authorities decided on six solutions. The workers at the new factory resumed work collectively this morning, and the Support Association of Various Circles also ended its activities. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Maintenance Team Withdrew Yesterday. After the workers at the new factory went on strike to support the old factory, a strike committee was established, and a maintenance team was organized to maintain order around the factory gate and on the docks every day to prevent villains from causing trouble and accidents. Therefore, the order during the workers' two-month strike was quite good. The Party and government authorities, together with leaders from all walks of life and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, have decided on six solutions and ordered both parties to comply. After the workers received the instructions, they held an emergency meeting and decided to accept them. All members of the maintenance team have withdrawn since yesterday morning, and the strike committee has also ceased operations.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang and Shanghai Telephone Communication is Busy</h3>
<p>Hundreds of calls are made daily. Zhejiang Province will waive the registration fee. After the Ministry of Transportation and the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau implemented telephone cooperation, all counties in Zhejiang Province can communicate with Shanghai by telephone. It is learned that since the beginning of cooperation between the Ministry and the Province, business has been exceptionally busy. Every day, there are telephone calls between Shanghai and various places in Zhejiang Province, such as Ningbo, Yuyao, Zhenhai, Suian, Tangqi, Xiaoshan, Jiaxing, Mogan Mountain, Pinghu, Xiashi, Nanxun, Jiashan, Wuxing, Linghu, and Haiyan, totaling about hundreds of calls.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that in order to promote long-distance telephone service and facilitate users in various parts of Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau plans to stipulate that all users who have installed the bureau's municipal telephones in Hangzhou or telephones in outer counties and towns can register for long-distance telephone service free of charge. This has been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, and Hangzhou City will implement it from the 21st of this month. The telephone branch bureaus in various towns can also start implementing it from August 1st.</p>
<h3>The Five-District Cigarette Industry Union Will Handle Matters</h3>
<p>After the Party and government decided on the solutions, the strike committee notified the workers at the new factory to return to work in the factory this morning. Fearing that unexpected events might occur temporarily, the Municipal Public Security Bureau specifically instructed the Third District Public Security Bureau to send police to maintain order around the factory gate and protect the workers' return to work. At the same time, in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from causing trouble, the Public Security Bureau has also sent police to guard and protect the factory since yesterday.</p>
<p>The Support Association Has Ended. According to Shao Xubai, a standing committee member of the Support Association of Various Circles, various circles in this city previously jointly organized the Committee to Support Workers of the British-American Tobacco Factory because the labor dispute at the British-American factory had been deadlocked. Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Shao Xubai, and twenty-two others were elected as members to actively carry out support activities to promote an early resolution of the dispute. Since the Party and government authorities and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have agreed on solutions for the labor dispute, and the workers have scheduled to resume work tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning), the dispute has come to an end, and the mission of the association has also ended. Therefore, it is planned to convene a meeting within days to make a decision and announce its dissolution.</p>

<p>Participating in the Provincial National Exhibition</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Departed for Zhenjiang Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>=More than 120 participants. Representatives from various groups came to the station to see them off.= The domestic goods manufacturers in this city who are participating in the Zhenjiang Provincial National Exhibition left for Zhenjiang by the Beijing-Shanghai 8:00 AM express train yesterday morning under the leadership of the China National Products Manufacturers Association. The departure situation of the association is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Station</h3>
<p>A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency drove to the North Station at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning and met Mr. Liu Zhongying, a standing committee member of the association. However, at this time, Mr. Liu was busy directing and greeting the manufacturers' representatives who were dressed and ready to depart, so he did not have time to talk. Next to the iron fences at the east and west entrances of the North Station, a large silk association flag with white background and black characters was firmly erected. At 7:30 AM, representatives from various factories arrived one after another and gathered next to the platform. They all wore association membership cards. The clothing was uniformly required by the association in advance: white inverted-collar shirts, white shorts, and when boarding the train, each person held a small flag. Led by Liu Zhongying and others, they marched into the platform in an orderly manner, which was quite spectacular.</p>
<h3>Farewell Representatives</h3>
<p>Those who went to the station to see them off included Huang Mengtu, Chen Guomin, Zhang Dezhai, representatives of the Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods; Xu Genghua, representative of the National Goods Maintenance Association; Jiang Zhonghe and Sun Choucheng, representatives of the National Goods Factory Federation; Wang Jian'e, representative of the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Company; Zhang Xianfang, Xu Jutang, Cai Qiajun, Liu Hongyuan, representatives of the Citizens' Federation; Zhang Yichen, representative of the Lijiiao Federation; Gu Wensheng and Ma Junshuo, representatives of various fellow-townsman associations from Pudong and Nantong; and Wang Hesong, Liang Gengshun, Xu Xiaochu, and Chen Youyun, representatives of the district branch associations of the Municipal Federation, totaling more than 100 people.</p>
<h3>Departure Situation</h3>
<p>At 7:50 AM, the member manufacturers boarded the train accompanied by Liu Zhongying and others. Liu expressed his gratitude to the guests who came to see them off one by one. At exactly 8:00 AM, the train slowly started. The manufacturers waved their small flags out the windows to signal their departure. In an instant, the train had left the platform, and those who had come to see them off went their separate ways.</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>The association issued a declaration saying, "Jiangsu is an area of wealth in southeastern China. Shanghai was originally a county of Jiangsu. Due to historical relations, Shanghai manufacturers should gladly participate in the promotion of industry and commerce in the provincial capital. Now that Shanghai has separated from Jiangsu and become a city directly under the Executive Yuan, and the capital of Jiangsu has moved to Zhenjiang because the National Government has established its capital in Nanjing, Shanghai and the provincial capital of Jiangsu can be said to be completely unrelated in terms of administrative divisions. However, Shanghai manufacturers have a very clear understanding of the lack of barriers in the economy. At a time when various countries in the world are implementing economic nationalism, it is felt that the domestic economy must be connected without hindrance. The government's implementation of the abolition of transit duties over the years shows that Shanghai manufacturers' observations are not wrong. In Shanghai manufacturers' view, China's biggest weaknesses are poverty and lack of education. Popularizing education and revitalizing industry are mutually dependent and cannot be carried out alone, while division of labor and cooperation are supreme methods. Popularizing education is a matter for education, while revitalizing industry is the responsibility of manufacturers. However, without the promotion of Party and government organs and the protection of military and police organs, even if what is planned may not always go wrong, the blind leading the blind are more likely to fall to the ground at night. Natural and man-made disasters cannot be resisted. Shanghai manufacturers, in view of the fact that imports of foreign goods have been increasing year by year, while exports of domestic goods have been gradually decreasing, resulting in an increasing trade deficit and insufficient cash to remain in the country to supply rural areas, revitalize finance, and lower the prices of agricultural products, have often considered cooperating with Party and government organs in various provinces outside of Shanghai to hold domestic goods exhibitions so that compatriots in the interior can recognize that domestic goods are no different from imported goods and that the cost is worth it. If the Chinese people all regard using domestic goods as a courtesy, righteousness, and integrity, and regard not using domestic goods as a shame, then China's economic self-sufficiency will be Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, most of which have already been realized. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, in order to promote domestic goods and believes that the public's use of domestic goods is the first movement of the new life as advocated by the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, the Manufacturers Association has agreed to hold a domestic goods exhibition in the capital of Jiangsu Province. It was originally scheduled to open on July 20, but it was postponed to the 25th due to the delayed delivery of goods. This is something that Shanghai manufacturers are even more sorry for. Starting today, the domestic goods produced by Shanghai manufacturers will meet with compatriots in the provincial capital. Although we dare not say that their price and quality are no different from foreign goods, at least some people will recognize that there is something they have never seen before. China has such a thing that is better than imported goods. Compatriots in the provincial capital must understand that the selling price of the domestic goods in the exhibition is cheaper than ordinary goods because, on the one hand, Party and government organs are making every effort to support them, and expenses are reduced. On the other hand, manufacturers are acting as advertisers and do not care about the cost, hoping that compatriots in the provincial capital will develop a mentality and habit of using domestic goods. The loss of cost and the consumption of spirit are certainly not estimated. Compatriots in the provincial capital, foreign military aggression is enough to destroy a country, and foreign economic aggression is even more enough to destroy a country and even a race. Just imagine, if money runs out, which country in the world will send us foreign goods for use? Wouldn't we freeze and starve to death and eventually become extinct? Shanghai manufacturers are extremely willing for compatriots in the provincial capital to make suggestions so that domestic goods can be improved day by day and become more refined, so that domestic goods can flow smoothly and foreign goods can become the end of their rope in the Chinese market and even disappear. The support of Party and government organs is deeply appreciated by Shanghai manufacturers. In addition to the declaration, we express our special thanks."</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Slogans</h3>
<p>Hating foreign goods is a steel knife that kills us. The domestic goods movement is a gun that kills the enemy. People, rise up and work hard to promote domestic goods. Hey, are you Chinese? Why don't you use domestic goods? Buying foreign goods shortens the life of the country. The domestic goods movement is a national salvation movement. Purchasing domestic goods is the duty of a citizen. Promoting domestic goods is to realize the Prime Minister's Principle of the People's Livelihood. Promoting domestic goods is to overthrow the economic aggression of imperialists. Buying one more point of domestic goods is to save one point of national rights and interests. Promoting domestic goods is our lifelong belief. Buying foreign goods is our public enemy. The New Life Movement is the national salvation movement.</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu Reported by Telegram</p>
<h3>Ills of Chinese Industry</h3>
<p>Drawing Lessons from Four Swiss Factories, Chinese Factories Should Start with Rectifying Their Products; Qian Chengxu, Standing Director of the China General Federation of Industry, Served as Employer Advisor to the International Labour Conference and Travelled Abroad to Inspect Industries in Various Countries. A Telegram was Received from Zurich, Switzerland, to the following effect: Shanghai China General Federation of Industry, forwarded to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories Federation, Shanghai Domestic Goods Factories Federation, China Production and Sales Cooperative Association, and various industrial groups for consideration. After the Labour Conference adjourned, I visited many factories in Zurich, Abort, and other places in Switzerland. The scale of these factories is generally not large. Their advantages are: (1) The current industry in Switzerland has evolved from traditional handicrafts. Therefore, the quality of their products is generally high. Almost every product is exquisite and practical. In manufacturing, they never produce shoddy goods to sell cheaply. On the buyer's side, they only seek genuine products at fair prices and never covet cheap purchases. Therefore, the relationship between production and sales is entirely centered on the quality of the goods. Over the years, Swiss products have been able to compete with major industrial nations in the world's major commercial markets and ultimately prevail, which is maintained by this point. In Zurich, I inquired about the impact of the global economic downturn to a copper mill factory. They said that Switzerland did not produce much, so it had not been greatly affected. They also showed me their order book, which showed that their sales were scheduled until April 1936. The same situation applied to two or three other leather and cloth factories and small electrical appliance factories. There was no inventory. From this, it can be inferred that adopting the principle of refined and high-priced manufacturing is viable on a small scale. (2) Swiss people pay extreme attention to scientific management. Therefore, although the factories are small, their arrangements for both machinery and personnel are well-organized. They do not employ many workers, and the staff is not in the habit of employing people just to fill positions. In one factory, I investigated its situation and found that each worker had a daily performance record book, and each workshop had a daily production record book. By 12:00 noon on the second day, the factory management had already compiled the statement, knowing how many goods a certain worker had produced within the stipulated time, how much each workshop had produced, and how much the entire factory had produced. The cost of all the goods was calculated. This is the effectiveness of cost accounting. If a company can emulate this, it will not incur much expense. (3) In Switzerland, it is rare to see the same type of goods manufactured in the same place. The principle is to prevent competition among the same industry and maintain prices, preventing supply from exceeding demand. The government pays special attention to this. If such goods are already abundant in the country or are manufactured in large quantities by other countries in the market, the government's attitude is that it would rather not have this type of industry in the country than waste national capital on useless ventures, which would lead to factory closures and unemployment in the future. In Geneva, the representative of the Swiss government told me that before the global economic downturn in 1929, local merchants saw that several industries were profitable and registered with the government. However, the government believed that the world's output was too high and could not be sustained and rejected their requests. Subsequently, due to oversupply, all countries were affected. Switzerland was not affected and preserved a great deal of capital. During my ten days in Switzerland, I often discussed industrial policies with many people in the industrial sector. I deeply felt that the current problems in China's industry are the opposite of Switzerland's situation. Therefore, I cite three points to warn the people of the country, so that every domestic goods factory in the country can be thoroughly aware of this and move towards the right track, starting with rectifying the current products, and then planning for expansion, which is the fundamental solution. Otherwise, the existing good products in the country will be squeezed out by inferior products, and the result will be elimination. Domestic goods will have no place in the market, whether domestic or foreign. Qian Chengxu, from Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan Drafting Commercial Registration Law</p>
<h3>Huang Youchang Comes to Shanghai to Investigate Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Hoping to complete the draft during the summer recess and pass and announce it upon the end of the recess. There are remedial provisions for partnership debts. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and others previously submitted that Article 681 of the Civil Code on Obligations, which stipulates that partnerships bear joint and several liability, is inconsistent with China's commercial conditions and its implementation will inevitably encounter many difficulties. They petitioned the Legislative Yuan to amend it. However, the Legislative Yuan failed to pass it during its session. The Chamber of Commerce and others again requested the prompt enactment of a commercial registration law to remedy this. The Commercial Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan decided to complete the drafting during the summer recess so that it could be submitted for passage upon the end of the recess in late August. It specially appointed Committee Member Huang Youchang to come to Shanghai to investigate market conditions for reference. Mr. Huang arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The Xinsheng News Agency paid a special visit to his residence to inquire about the key points of the investigation. The details of Mr. Huang's conversation are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Unification of Civil and Commercial Law</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang first stated that China's commercial law has been independent of civil law since the late Qing Dynasty. It was not until June 1929, when the Central Political Conference resolved to compile a unified civil and commercial code, that commercial law was unified with civil law and merged into one. Those that could not be merged were to be enacted separately as individual laws. The laws that have been enacted and promulgated include the Company Law, the Negotiable Instruments Law, the Insurance Law, and the Maritime Law. The laws that have not been enacted and promulgated include the Commercial Registration Law and the Business Name Law. The Commercial Registration Law is expected to be completed during this summer recess. It can be submitted to the General Assembly for passage and implementation upon the end of the recess.</p>
<h3>Partnership Debts</h3>
<p>As for Article 681 of the Civil Code on Obligations, which stipulates that partners are jointly and severally liable for debts, various commercial groups believe that it is difficult to implement. This Commercial Registration Law will include remedial measures, that is, those who register in accordance with the Commercial Registration Law can share the debt liability according to the number of shares registered; otherwise, they will still be jointly and severally liable. I was appointed as the drafter of this law. To avoid making decisions behind closed doors, I came to Shanghai to investigate because Shanghai is the commercial center of the country. At the beginning of the legislation, I first sought to understand the actual situation so that its implementation would not be difficult after its promulgation.</p>
<h3>Two Points of Investigation</h3>
<p>The key points of this planned investigation are: first, silent partnerships. In Chinese custom, those who invest in business often do not want to disclose their names and use the name of a certain "ji" or "tang." If they register in this way, there is a risk that no one will bear the debt liability. Second, business names that do not register in accordance with the Company Law call themselves "companies," which may mislead those who trade with them into believing that they are legally registered companies, or they may suffer losses as a result. These all need to be corrected and remedied in the law after investigating the actual situation.</p>
<h3>Drafting in a Different Location</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, I have not yet met with the persons in charge of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce because it is Saturday and Sunday. Tomorrow (that is, today), I will hold a meeting with the persons in charge of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to request assistance in the investigation and provide specific opinions and practical materials for reference. I especially hope that those who are familiar with the commercial situation in Shanghai will provide practical opinions. After obtaining sufficient information, I will go to another place to draft because Shanghai is noisy and not very suitable.</p>
<p>Cai Wuji and Others Go to Qingdao</p>
<h3>Attending Technical Conference Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Miao Zhongxiu and Wu Juenong were transferred to Hankou by order of the Ministry of Industry to attend the Second Commodity Inspection Technical Conference of the Ministry of Industry, which opened on the 13th of this month at the Science Museum of Shandong University in Qingdao. The conference lasted three days and closed on the 15th. Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Chief Technicians Miao Zhongxiu, Ye Yuanding, Chen Shunyun, Liu Dongye, Zhou Zhenjun, Jiang Gongchen, You Yi, Wu Juenong, Zhang Jingou, and others went to Qingdao on the 11th to attend the conference. After the conference, the mayor of Qingdao, Shen Honglie, and others invited them to tour the scenic spots of Qingdao. Cai Wuji, the director of the bureau, and the chief technicians, representatives from this city, returned south by ship the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to news released by the bureau, Miao Zhongxiu and Wu Juenong, directors of the Silk and Tea Inspection Group, were requested by the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry because of the heavy workload of various inspections in Hankou and the lack of experienced inspection directors. Therefore, they requested that Mr. Miao and Mr. Wu be transferred to Hankou to take up their duties in order to make use of their expertise. It is now heard that the authorities of the Ministry of Industry have approved this and have notified the bureau a few days ago.</p>
<p>Special Commissioner for Industrial Inspection of Sichuan</p>
<h3>Mei Shuzeng Goes to Beijing to Report</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan previously appointed Mei Shuzeng as the special commissioner for industrial inspection of Sichuan. After receiving the order, Mr. Mei set off for Sichuan to investigate the industrial conditions of Sichuan Province and how to start developing industries. After several months, he returned to Shanghai on the 19th. On the way, he suffered from the summer heat and did not report immediately when he passed through Beijing. After resting in Shanghai for three days, he has recovered his health. Therefore, he took the night express to Beijing last night to meet with Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan to report on his findings and present his opinions on developing Sichuan industries in detail. The reporter of the Riri News Agency met with Mr. Mei at his residence yesterday and recorded his conversation as follows.</p>
<p>Industrial Conditions in Sichuan According to Mr. Mei, the criticism of Sichuan by people from other provinces is either "the Land of Abundance" or "the Devil's Den." In fact, both terms are misleading. Sichuan's land is fertile and its products are abundant, which has been the case since ancient times. This is the origin of the beautiful name "Land of Abundance." However, since the founding of the Republic of China, due to the instability of the political situation and the turmoil of wars, the annual value of Sichuan's exported goods compared to its imported goods has a deficit of about 10 million yuan. With such a large deficit, how can it be called the "Land of Abundance"? As for being called the "Devil's Den," it is because Sichuan's taxes are often pre-collected for decades in advance. This is an abnormal phenomenon during the military period. However, because Sichuan's land tax is actually lighter than that of other provinces due to Zhang Xianzhong's rebellion in the late Ming Dynasty, and agricultural products are abundant, the people can barely support themselves despite such exploitation. The term "Devil's Den" is an exaggeration. During my visit to Sichuan to conduct inspections, I felt that Chairman Liu (Xiang) has gradually put everything on track in politics since unifying the military. It is hoped that with time, the past chaos and darkness can be completely eradicated, and new light can be brought to Sichuan's government. After political improvement, the social situation will naturally be renewed. The national agricultural bankruptcy and various economic downturns will naturally not be an exception in Sichuan. However, Sichuan's soil resources are richer than those of other provinces. If they can be fully developed, the so-called "Land of Abundance" can truly live up to its name. Fundamental Plan for Development There are thousands of ways to develop industries, and I don't know where to start. The most fundamental need is to facilitate transportation. How to build the necessary railways and how to build roads between counties to connect Sichuan's blood vessels and ensure smooth traffic are the prerequisites for industrial development. I have had several close discussions with Chairman Liu on this matter. This time, I will also report to Premier Wang in detail and request his support. The second is capital. The economic strength of Sichuan people is limited. Without absorbing a large amount of foreign investment and cooperating together, it is not enough to talk about development. However, industrialists often have a fear of investing. In terms of Sichuan's past situation, their fear is justified. However, in my opinion, things are different now than in the past. The various fearsome facts of the past will no longer exist in the future. Therefore, I hope that the major entrepreneurs in the country will move from fear to suspicion, from suspicion to experimentation, and from experimentation to success. Then, investment will flow in, which will be the fortune of Sichuan and also the fortune of China.</p>
<p>Hoping the Banking Sector Will Invest In recent years, China's banking sector has mostly invested in real estate and government bonds due to the depression of industry and commerce and the abundance of idle funds. This is indeed a situation they cannot avoid, but both are not the right path and have considerable adverse effects on the country and the people. I believe that the banking sector should take assisting industry and commerce and developing people's productivity as its primary task. Recently, Zhang Gongquan, a leading figure in the banking sector, has already realized this and has already planned to invest in Sichuan. However, I hope that his investment methods will meet the above-mentioned requirements so that it can benefit the people of Sichuan and not just make superficial investments because of the higher interest rates on loans in Sichuan. Because Sichuan has been militarily unified, and Chairman Liu is determined to revitalize it with his talent, things can be done. I also plan to do my best to work hard for the construction of Sichuan. The details will be gradually released after organizing the survey and enabling the people of the country to understand the true situation of Sichuan and work together.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Zhu Jiahao, and Chu Minyi took the night express to Beijing last night.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming took the night train out of Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Huaibei Salt Merchants</p>
<h3>Representatives Petition the Audit Office</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that since the Lianghuai Transportation Envoy stopped the import of salt to the Zhongzheng Old Salt Tuo in the Huaibei Zhongzheng Market and ordered the Yuan merchants to import salt to the Zhangxinzha, the Yuan merchants of the market opposed it because it was inconvenient to transport from the new tuo, which would hinder transportation and affect tax revenue. The people and workers there opposed the abolition of the old tuo because it would harm their livelihoods. They had previously sent representatives Huang Zhongwei and others, along with Yuan merchant representatives Tang Huabo and Luo Hengfu, and transportation merchant representative Wang Youshan, to Beijing to petition the senior salt administration officials. They had received a reply ordering the transportation envoy to consider public opinion and handle it carefully. Recently, due to the flooding of the river, the old river channel between Zhongzheng and Zhangxinzha was temporarily difficult to repair. The Yuan and transportation merchant representatives of the market, Tang Huabo and others, petitioned the Salt Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Audit Office, requesting that the Yuan merchants be temporarily allowed to import salt to the old tuo before the problem of the new and old tuo is resolved, so that the transportation merchants could take advantage of the water to pay taxes and rush transportation, and reduce the cost of transportation merchants. Yuan merchant representative Tang Huabo met with the director of the Shanghai Audit Office a few days ago. Secretary Fei received him on behalf of the director. The director of the office also considered the reasons presented by the representative to be justified and agreed to send a telegram to the transportation envoy ordering him to temporarily allow the Yuan merchants to import salt to the old tuo in order to relieve the困境 of the Jiangsu merchants and increase tax revenue. It is not known whether the transportation envoy will comply with the order after receiving the telegram.</p>
<p>Northwest Problem Research Association</p>
<h3>Organizing a Northwest Investigation Group</h3>
<p>Scheduled to depart from Nanjing by special train the day after tomorrow. Members in this city should register quickly. The Northwest Problem Research Association was established to study Northwest problems and plan for the development of the Northwest. It previously organized the National Goods Mobile Exhibition Group, which achieved excellent results. Recently, it was heard that the association has organized a Northwest Investigation Group to thoroughly understand the actual situation in the Northwest. The chairman of Suiyuan Province, Fu Zuoyi, greatly supports this plan. Therefore, the group is scheduled to depart from Beijing on the 25th of this month (Wednesday) by special train on the Jinpu Railway. On the Beijing side, Chairman Fu will send a first- and second-class train on the PingSui Railway to meet them in Beijing. All members of the association in this city who wish to participate in the investigation can register with the editorial office of the association at No. 17, Continental Fang, Luban Road, French Concession, before the 25th.</p>

<p>Civil Movement Association Strictly Prohibits</p>
<h3>Participating in the Pan-Pacific Buddhist Association</h3>
<p>The purpose of this association is to assist the government in luring our religious followers to fulfill its aggressive conspiracy. The Central Civil Movement Association issued a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, strictly prohibiting participation in the Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Association, stating: "According to confidential reports, the Japan Buddhist Youth Federation held the so-called Pan-Pacific Buddhist Youth Association conference in Tokyo in late July of this year. It has been found that the purpose of this association is to assist the government in luring our country's Buddhist believers to fulfill its aggressive conspiracy, and among the countries invited, it actually lists the pseudo-organizations alongside our country, which is an extreme insult to our country. However, some of our country's Buddhist believers have actually claimed to be representatives and are going to participate. Such absurd actions should be immediately prohibited. Special attention should be paid to their use of religious freedom as a pretext to conceal their true intentions. Furthermore, please order all civil groups that any behavior related to Japanese puppets must be prohibited unless approved by the central and local senior party and government organs. Otherwise, in addition to disbanding the group, they will be severely punished according to law."</p>
<p>National Prayer for Rain and Disaster Relief Conference</p>
<h3>Closed Yesterday Upon Completion of Merit</h3>
<p>Zhang Tianshi Retired from the Altar in the Afternoon The "National Prayer for Rain and Disaster Relief Grand Conference," initiated by philanthropists Wang Yiting, Xu Guannan, and Shao Ruxin, together with Buddhist masters Taixu, Qinghai, Quefei, and others, has been reported in the newspapers since the 20th of this month, with Zhang Ruiling issuing talismans and ascending the altar. However, the conference was originally scheduled to present a memorial to Heaven at 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, but due to rain, it was postponed until yesterday morning. Yesterday, also due to rain, Zhang Ruiling did not ascend the altar and present the memorial to Heaven until 8:45 AM. The Dharma ritual was performed by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Puli Nianfo Association, along with the Dharma judges and Taoist friends holding Dharma instruments and banners, circling the altar several times in the Yubu step. At this time, Zhang burned the memorial to Heaven to appeal to the heavens, and the Dharma ritual was completed. At 5:00 PM, Zhang performed the ritual of burning talismans and retiring from the altar, and the merit was fulfilled.</p>
<p>City Roads Developed Year by Year</p>
<h3>Various Vehicle Taxes Will Be Increased</h3>
<p>In addition to the automobile tax, which was slightly increased in the spring of this year due to changes in grades, the tax rates for other types of vehicles in the city have not been increased in the four years since 1920. It is now heard that the authorities believe that the development of roads in the urban area requires costs for construction and maintenance, which cannot be met without increasing vehicle taxes. Moreover, the vehicle tax rates in this city have always been lower than those in special zones. It has now been decided to increase the tax rates for various vehicles, roughly as follows: (1) The quarterly tax for various automobiles will be increased by 25% of the original tax rate. (2) The annual tax for motorcycles will be changed to 28 yuan per vehicle. (3) The quarterly tax for private carriages will be changed to 9 yuan per vehicle. (4) The monthly tax for commercial carriages will be changed to 5 yuan per vehicle. (5) The quarterly tax for freight carriages will be changed to 12 yuan per vehicle. (6) The annual tax for human-powered bicycles will be changed to 3 yuan per vehicle. (7) The quarterly tax for private rickshaws will be changed to 7.5 yuan per vehicle. It is heard that after the implementation of these new tax rates, the city treasury's annual income can be increased by more than 240,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Ministry of Transportation</p>
<h3>Establishing Postal Advertisements</h3>
<p>Four methods prescribed; ordered post offices to trial-run yesterday The Ministry of Transportation considers that post offices are located throughout the country and have a wide range. If the postal offices' locations can be used to conduct advertising, it can provide more convenience for the public and increase the postal business. Most countries in the world now invite merchants to contract for this advertising business. Our country's post offices can also follow suit. The ministry recently prescribed four methods for establishing postal advertisements and ordered Guo Xinsong, director of the Postal Administration, to review the market needs of this city and try to run them. If successful, they will be gradually promoted. The methods prescribed by the ministry are as follows: (1) Printed Advertisements: Various receipts, mailing slips, postal regulations, and stamps of the post office can be used to publish merchant advertisements. (2) Internal Advertisements: Wooden frames can be hung above each counter in the office, below the counter body, and on the walls to display advertisements. (3) External Advertisements: Advertisements can be installed outside the post office walls, on the roof, and on the post boxes. (4) Advertising Nature: All advertisements should primarily promote domestic goods, but foreign merchant advertisements may be accommodated in light of circumstances to increase revenue. All advertisements must be submitted to the post office for permission before they can be published. After receiving the order, the post office has begun to draft methods for inviting merchants to contract for the business and will implement them soon. It is expected that this advertising, due to the wide range of post offices, will be very effective, and merchants who publish will be very crowded.</p>
<p>Songjiang County Government Plans to Establish</p>
<h3>Jinshanwei Sea Bathing Beach</h3>
<p>Expedite the construction of dressing rooms and refreshment stalls. The fishing industry responds to the marine culture movement. Director of Construction Department of Jiangsu Province, Shen Baixian, came to Songjiang on New Year's Day (13th) to inspect coastal construction projects. In view of the fact that general tourists and foreigners visit the scenic spots of Zhapu and Qijiadun, they all use Jinshanwei as a resting place and bathe in the sea. However, the facilities such as bathing beaches and receptions are still lacking. A letter was sent to the Jin County Magistrate to expedite the construction of dressing rooms and beverage shops, and to plan for the facilities of the seaside bathing beach. After receiving the letter, the Songjiang County Government immediately ordered a commissioner to Jin to work day and night to expedite the construction. It is also heard that Jin Yuanyu, Huang Ruxiong, Gu Xuan, and others from the aquatic academic circles believe that the construction of the Eastern Port of Zhapu will bring prosperity to the fishing industry in Jinshanwei. Therefore, they have jointly joined the leaders of the local fishing industry, Zhang Mingguang, Jiang Yangzhong, and Li Shibai, to first respond and engage in the movement of aquatic life display preparation and fishing books and other marine cultural facilities. The discussion will be held at the fishing association's annual meeting at 21:00 this month.</p>
<p>Hongqiao Sanatorium Sends</p>
<h3>Circular to National Physicians</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium recently sent a circular to national physicians, which reads as follows: Gentlemen, to meet the needs of society, we have specially built a new-style sanatorium on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai. Located in the western suburbs, the environment is quiet. Since its opening, we have relied on the guidance of all sectors to achieve a certain scale, and we strive to perfect our equipment and services while keeping our fees as low as possible to suit the economic conditions of society and meet the needs of the medical community and patients. However, as this is a public welfare undertaking, it cannot be perfected without the enthusiastic participation of comrades and concerted efforts. We have always admired your enthusiasm for medical undertakings. We hope that you will give us your advice and rely on your grand strategies and plans to encourage our progress and live up to the expectations of society. If you agree and give us your guidance, or if you need the services of our hospital, we will welcome you sincerely. Yours truly, and we look forward to your enlightened teachings. We wish you good health.</p>
<p>German Merchant Sues Rong Zongjing</p>
<h3>There is Hope for Reconciliation</h3>
<p>380,000 in payment for goods was due but could not be paid. The Shenxin Cotton Mill, founded by industrial magnate Rong Zongjing, ordered cotton yarn worth more than 380,000 yuan from the French Fugue Foreign Company a few months ago. The company delivered the goods on time, and Shenxin issued a post-dated check to Fugue. However, recently, Rong announced his retirement due to the economic downturn, which led to the failure of various businesses. Most of the checks given to the Fugue Foreign Company have expired and cannot be paid. The manager of the Fugue Foreign Company, Hans, hired lawyers Lu Congzu and Fesi to file a criminal lawsuit against Rong for fraudulently obtaining property in the First Special District Court. The court has accepted the case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Yongjin summoned him in the eighth criminal court. The defendant, Rong Zongjing, did not appear. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that there may be a possibility of reconciliation in this case and requested permission to postpone the hearing in order to proceed with reconciliation. The court granted the request and ordered that the case be rescheduled for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Sues Father-in-Law for Fraud</h3>
<p>Making socks accumulated four hundred yuan; the passbook has no interest. Mrs. Zhang Gu, a woman from Pudong residing at No. 20, Lishes East Fang, Nanshi Railway Station Road, reported to the French Concession Police on the 20th that she was 20 years old. She said that in January of last year, she was married to Zhang Qiuan, the second son of Zhang Jingyuan, a resident of Zhangjiang, Nanhui, by the order of her parents and the words of a matchmaker. She had a dowry of 400 yuan. However, after she married, her father-in-law, Zhang Jingyuan, told her sweetly that he would deposit this amount in his Tongsheng No. 4 Rice Store at a monthly interest rate of 1%. (Tongsheng Rice Store is located at No. 136, Mai Gao Bao Lu Road, French Concession.) At that time, the woman believed him and handed over the amount as a deposit. Unexpectedly, it has been more than 14 months since then, and she has not received any interest. She was only given a passbook (which read "Stored 400 yuan on June 1, 1934" with the seal of Tongsheng Xihang affixed). After the woman had someone read it, she was surprised. She confronted her father-in-law, but he was evasive. Under such circumstances (which constitutes a crime of fraud), she requested that he be investigated, etc. After receiving the report, the police officer ordered detectives to go to the Tongsheng Rice Store to bring Zhang in for questioning. After questioning, the police officer ordered them to leave. The day before yesterday, he was summoned to the eighth criminal court of the Second Special Court. First, the complainant stated the previous situation and said that the money was entirely the money she had saved since she was 16 years old making socks at her maiden home and requested an investigation. When Zhang Jingyuan was questioned, he claimed that his daughter-in-law had never asked him to deposit any money. As for the passbook in her hand, the money was deposited by his eldest and second sons, and the book was placed in the merchant's box. He did not know how she took it. The rest of his words were evasive. Judge Sun ordered the defendant to post bail and reschedule the hearing after the books of Tongsheng Store were delivered for inspection.</p>
<p>Prisoner</p>
<h3>Still Restless in Custody</h3>
<p>Three prisoners gang up to beat fellow inmate, lawsuit proceeds to court for verdict. Gold thief Jin Shisheng, Wang Youlin, Zhao Guangfu, Xu Guilin, and others were previously arrested by the French Concession police for repeated robberies and sentenced to imprisonment by the Second Special Court. Jin and others, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. Therefore, Jin and others were temporarily held in Room 8 of the detention center. However, on the 30th of last month, Wang Youlin demanded money from Jin Shisheng but failed. He ganged up with Zhao and Xu to brutally beat Jin. The warden of the detention center learned of this and put the main culprits in shackles and separated them. Meanwhile, Jin Shisheng filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Wang Youlin and others of assault. During the interrogation the other day, Jin Shisheng claimed that he and Wang Youlin were detained together. Last month, Wang asked him for 50 yuan, but he refused. Wang then ganged up with Zhao Guangfu and others to tie up his mouth and nose with a prison uniform, and then brutally beat him, causing severe injuries to his waist, shoulders, arms, etc., which could be proven by Dr. Zeng Shan’s medical examination. He requested a severe investigation. Wang Youlin confessed that he and Jin had handed over the stolen money from previous robberies to Jin Shisheng. He was now in custody, and his family was poor, so he asked Jin to lend him 20 yuan to send to his family. Jin immediately agreed, but when his family came to visit, they said they had not received any money from Jin. Therefore, he questioned Jin, who became angry and slapped him in the face, leading to an argument but no assault. The others gave evasive answers. Zhao Guangfu and Xu Guilin both testified that they had tried to dissuade them and did not help in the assault. The witnesses, inmate You A'er and guard Wang Guanghe, also testified in court about the defendants' assault. Judge Qiu declared the debate closed and awaited the verdict.</p>
<h3>Rumors Kill Two Lives</h3>
<p>Rumors that an uncle was having an affair with his sister-in-law led to anger, and both committed suicide one after another. Li Dafeng, a 44-year-old man from Zhenjiang, lived with his younger brother in the upstairs of the Lu Haiji Barber Shop at 385 North Xiangfen Lane in the International Settlement. They had an excellent relationship. His younger brother married a woman named Chen, a 38-year-old from the same town, who was somewhat attractive. Recently, rumors spread that Li was having an affair with his sister-in-law, causing gossip. Li and Chen were unjustly accused and extremely resentful. Yesterday afternoon, at about 3 p.m., Chen became weary of life and secretly ingested a large amount of opium to commit suicide. After being discovered by her family, she was rushed to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and she died at 9:20 p.m. Li suddenly heard the news of her death and was unwilling to live in the world. After dinner, he hanged himself. How tragic!</p>
<p>North Bridge</p>
<h3>Gu Zhong Min Xin Building Opens August 1st</h3>
<p>The Gu Zhong Building in Beiqiao Town, Shanghai County, has been renamed Min Xin Building. All equipment and items have been purchased and collected. It is now scheduled to be arranged by the county party headquarters and responsible agencies from the 25th to the 30th of this month, and the opening ceremony will be held on August 1st.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Must Arrive in Court on Time</h3>
<p>Otherwise, the case will be rejected. The First Special District Court has strictly adhered to the opening hours since yesterday. For the cases summoned, if the time specified on the summons is 8 a.m., the lawyer and the parties must arrive on time and must not be late. Otherwise, the case will be rejected. For example, yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan of the court summoned Cai Kuiqing to sue Dong for a criminal case. The scheduled time was 2 p.m., but neither party arrived on time. Judge Zhan immediately announced the opening of the court and declared that the case would not be accepted. At 2:20 p.m., the plaintiff's lawyer, Peng Fuhai, finally arrived, but the case had already been decided, and he had to return disappointed. Therefore, lawyers and parties must arrive at the court before the specified time to check in, otherwise the case will be rejected.</p>
<p>Ji Yi Benevolent Society</p>
<h3>Overview of the Hongkou Plague Hospital</h3>
<p>The Ji Yi Benevolent Society Hongkou Plague Hospital has been open for half a month, and the number of outpatients is the highest among all hospitals. This is because the location is in a civilian area, making it easier for the poor and sick to seek treatment, and the various facilities are relatively well-equipped. During the summer, many coolies and poor people sleep in the open, and their food is not carefully selected, resulting in various summer diseases. Therefore, the establishment of the hospital is indeed an urgent and indispensable plan. The progress of the hospital is something that readers who care about society are eager to know. The following is a summary of the hospital's total report for the 22nd: 8,768 outpatients, 2,394 vaccinations, 495 return visits, 1,072 inpatients, an average of 52 people per day, 17 severe cases, 5 deaths, 239 yuan in inpatient fees, and 6,046 yuan in donations from all walks of life. Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and there are fewer patients, but there are still more than 300 patients every day. Looking back at the huge numbers above, one is reminded of the lives of the poor and the causes of their illnesses. At this time of year, the seasons are abnormal, and there are dangers everywhere. If one does not cherish oneself, it is easy to get sick. If small problems are not addressed, they will become a huge flood. It is hoped that those who are responsible for guiding society will pay attention to this, so as not to dig a well when one is already thirsty.</p>
<p>Ding Fubao</p>
<h3>A New Contribution to the Elderly</h3>
<p>Compilation and Translation of "Longevity Techniques for the Elderly and Urinary Retention in the Elderly"</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao has recently compiled and translated the book "Longevity Techniques for the Elderly and Urinary Retention in the Elderly," which is of great benefit to the elderly. The Longevity Techniques section details the general hygiene methods for the elderly, as well as the elderly's need for leisure and contentment, abstinence from female sex, enjoyment of mountains, rivers, flowers, and trees, and the practice of meditation. Every word is precious, and there are many ancient sayings on nourishing life. The elderly can learn the art of prolonging life from this compilation.

<h3>Gospel for Those Suffering from Madness</h3>
<p>Ji Linlin and Four Others Recently Recovered and Discharged from the Hospital. The Shanghai Special Hospital for Madness in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, has remarkable effects in treating dementia, as repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Recently, Ji Linlin, a 22-year-old from Tongzhou who worked as a porter in the Sincere Company warehouse, suddenly became severely insane due to a special stimulus. His brother accompanied him to the hospital for treatment, and he recovered miraculously after being hospitalized for two weeks. Xia Yan, a resident of Dong Tangjia Lane, Huoshen Temple, Suzhou, also suffered from severe dementia. Her family sent her to the hospital for treatment, and she also recovered soon after being hospitalized. Cai Weitang, a male from Ningbo sent by the Huishan Police Station, and Lu Gu, a female sent by the Gordon Road Police Station, were also cured by the hospital and were subsequently taken home by their families.</p>
<p>Caojiadu</p>
<h3>Business Community Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the notice from the Public Works Bureau to demolish buildings. Merchants along the south bank of the Suzhou River in Caojiadu recently noticed that the Public Works Bureau sent surveyors to draw maps and set up markers. At the time, the merchants did not understand the truth, so they did not pay attention. However, a few days ago, the Public Works Bureau issued notices to the merchants, stating that all buildings encroaching on the Suzhou River must be demolished within five days, and sent personnel to give the same warning to the shops. If they failed to demolish the buildings within the time limit, the bureau would send workers to demolish them on their behalf. Upon hearing this news, the merchants were greatly surprised and requested the Third District Branch of the Citizens' Association to find a way to fight for their rights. The Citizens' Association then convened a meeting of merchants along the coast at the hall yesterday. The meeting was attended by standing committee members Chen Yunquan and Huang Zhihe, and merchant representatives Shi Shoudai, Shen Aihua, Chen Maisheng, Xue Kaomao, Chen Juqing, Hu Zijing, Gao Rongsheng, Qin Yangen, Hou Zhuchen, Jin Guitang, Lu Shuxing, Xu Yaoting, Shen Huoqing, Ni Binggen, Yao Senji, Liu Shunxing, Zhang Fushun, Zhang Fuyuan, Da Shun, Zhang Gongtai, Xinxingji, and others, totaling forty or fifty people. The meeting was chaired by Chen Yunquan, who immediately reported that after receiving everyone's official letter, the association had issued letters to the Public Works Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Land Bureau. However, the association felt that the matter was of great importance and should be discussed by everyone to find effective solutions. After joint discussion, the following resolutions were passed: (1) It was decided to send Chen Yunquan, Huang Zhihe, Chen Xi, and others to personally visit the Director of the Public Works Bureau to request (A) the immediate withdrawal of the order to demolish the buildings within a limited time, and (B) the re-appointment of personnel to re-stake the markers to restore property rights. (2) The content of the written request included the following points: A. The authorities stated that the buildings encroaching on the river must be demolished, but the shops had mostly been assessed and issued licenses. Why should they be considered encroaching? B. The markers staked by the Public Works Bureau were even placed on the private land of the people. Why was no attention paid to the people's property rights? C. Dredging the Suzhou River was originally related to municipal administration, but there must be certain standards. The current width of the river in Caojiadu is no less than other places, so it is difficult to understand why such a large-scale demolition is necessary. In short, the merchants depend on this place for their livelihoods. Once demolished, how can they survive? The authorities are requested to consider the difficulties of the merchants and handle the matter with caution. By the time the discussion was over, the bell had rung six times.</p>

<p>Greater Shanghai Consumer Cooperative</p>
<h3>Held a Meeting with Members</h3>
<p>The First Settlement Has Surplus. The Greater Shanghai Consumer Cooperative, located at 434 Pobo Road, French Concession, has been open since January last year. Its business has been quite developed. Daily necessities for families are fully equipped, and the prices are lower than those in the market. Therefore, the members and nearby residents are very welcome. There are currently more than 100 members. The deadline for the 22nd annual settlement has passed, and it is urgent to report to the members. Therefore, a general meeting of members was held the other day. Due to the hot weather, the number of members present was insufficient for the quorum, so it was changed to a discussion meeting. It is said that the results of the cooperative's annual settlement showed a surplus after deducting expenses, official interest, and depreciation, which is rare for newly established businesses. It also proves the appropriateness of the system adopted by the cooperative. It is now learned that the cooperative will solicit members on a large scale so that citizens have the opportunity to join, hoping that the cooperative business will be promoted throughout the city. Detailed regulations are available upon request.</p>

<h3>Forty-Two Straw Sheds Burned Down</h3>
<p>In the Xinxi District, Longhua Road, Damuqiao area under the jurisdiction of the Second District of Nanshi, there are rows of straw sheds. Most of the residents are rickshaw pullers, peddlers, or laborers, mostly from Jiangbei and Shandong. At about 2 a.m. yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Liu Longsheng, a native of Taixian, Jiangbei. The wind was quite strong at the time, and the fire spread to the straw sheds on both sides. Most of the residents were asleep and woke up screaming and crying. Fortunately, the Nanshi fire truck arrived and extinguished the fire in about an hour and a half. As a result, a total of forty-two straw sheds were burned down. Fortunately, no one was injured. Liu Longsheng, the source of the fire, was arrested by the district office and sent to the Second District Headquarters for questioning. Wang Hezhu, who lived with him, is still at large.</p>
<p>Ding Ziming</p>
<h3>Accused of Doing Business with Japanese Partners</h3>
<p>Ding Squandered the Money in Shanghai. Ding Ziming from Fujian was doing business in Uwajima, Japan, and married a Japanese woman named Sotoki Ima. In January of this year, he met two Japanese friends, Ban Shang and Guang Lai, who were fabric and carpet merchants. In March, Ding partnered with the two Japanese to load a large amount of the above-mentioned goods onto the Iga Mai Maru ship and bring them to Shanghai for sale. Ban and Guang also went to Shanghai together. Ding stayed at the Zhongnan Hotel on Aiduya Road and opened room 212, gradually trying to sell the goods. Later, the two Japanese returned to their country first, waiting for the goods to be sold out, and the money would be brought back as agreed. Unexpectedly, Ding squandered the money worth 4,000 yuan in Shanghai and disappeared without a trace. His residence in Uwajima was also secretly moved elsewhere. Recently, he was reported to the police stations for arrest. The other day, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongkou Police Station arrested him. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Public Works Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan stated the process. The defendant completely denied it. Judge Liu ordered him to be detained and rescheduled for investigation.</p>
<p>Naxun Road Red Pill Factory</p>
<h3>Shareholder Zhang Shilin Arrested</h3>
<p>On November 23 of last year, Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongkou Police Station cracked a red pill manufacturing factory at 9 Naxun Road. They arrested Wu Qingsheng, Wang Chengen, Yang Changsheng, and other criminals from Shaoxing, along with a large amount of red pills, and sent them to the First Special District Court. They confessed that a shareholder, Zhang Shilin from Taizhou, was at large, and an arrest warrant was issued. The sentences of Wu and other criminals had expired and they had been released. The other day, Wang Chengying, the head of the Chinese detectives of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, learned that Zhang was hiding at 279 Fuli Road in the French Concession. He then cooperated with the French Concession police detectives to arrest him at the address. The next morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Public Works Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan stated the previous situation and requested a postponement. The defendant denied it. Judge Xiao ordered him to be detained and rescheduled for investigation.</p>
<h3>Ni Yang Dispute Not Over</h3>
<p>Ni Filed Another Lawsuit. Yang Bingxun, the principal of Bingxun Chinese Lianji School, suspected his wife Ni Fengyue of misconduct, which led to lawsuits such as the ear-biting case. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Later, Ni and Yang agreed to divorce because the relationship between husband and wife had already been cracked and it was difficult to live together. The divorce agreement stipulated that Yang would pay Ni 50 yuan per month for living expenses, and the son Xuanren would be raised by Yang. At that time, Ni could not live on the meager 50 yuan, so she asked Yang to increase it. Yang's students Jiang Shibin and Zhang Shao mediated, and Yang agreed to pay an additional 50 yuan per month. However, after Xuanren was taken away by Yang, he repeatedly escaped to Ni's place and refused to live with Yang. Ni, bound by the agreement, persuaded him to go back, but Xuanren refused and cried. Recently, Yang suddenly regretted his verbal promise to pay an additional 50 yuan and refused to pay. Therefore, Ni hired lawyers Yu Siliang and Ma Yeming to file a lawsuit against Yang with the First Special Court, demanding that Yang fulfill the contract, pay the promised monthly subsidy of 50 yuan, and provide a guarantee. Because the son Xuanren did not want to return to Yang, and the contract did not specify that he must live with Yang, it was requested that Ni raise Xuanren until he came of age, and Yang should bear the costs of raising and educating him. The court accepted the lawsuit and summoned the parties for questioning in the Thirteenth Civil Court yesterday. The plaintiff requested that Jiang and Zhang be summoned to testify in court, and that the Chinese policeman No. 3303 who was present at the mediation of Jiang and Zhang be summoned as well. After the judge's hearing, he ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Drowning and Electrocution Result in Death</h3>
<p>Bao Liyong Died in Vain. Bao Liyong, a 25-year-old man from Jiangbei, made a living selling vegetarian chicken and other snacks. He lived at No. 32 Fumin Road inside the Dananmen. At about 12:00 noon yesterday, Bao finished his lunch and wanted to drink tea and wash his face. He took a lead pot and went to a nearby tiger stove to get hot water. Unexpectedly, while passing by the entrance of the Ruichang Tobacco Shop at No. 47 of the road, his finger accidentally touched a wooden pillar on the wall of the shop. The pillar was damaged, so it was wrapped with a sheet of lead. A wire was attached to the upper end of the pillar, and due to the rain and dampness, the wire leaked electricity. Bao's finger was electrocuted and he fell to the ground unconscious. The police officer on duty in the area heard about it and rushed to the scene. He rushed Bao to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but it was too late, and the treatment was ineffective. He died.</p>
<p>Civil Defense Corps Member</p>
<h3>Rehearing of Murder Case with Stolen Gun</h3>
<p>The appeal was sent back by the Supreme Court to the Suzhou Higher Court for rehearing the other day. During the summer of the previous year, robberies occurred in Longhua, Xujiahui, and other places. The Longhua Civil Defense Corps arrested Zhu A'si, a robber, who confessed to robbing a certain family in Xujiahui and dividing 50 yuan. He also confessed to obtaining dozens of yuan in another case and revealed that his accomplices had gathered in advance in the straw shed of Xu Yongnian in Rihuiqiao before setting off. The Civil Defense Corps immediately dispatched members Yang Yuanxing and Zhang Tai'an, armed with weapons, to arrest the suspect Zhu A'si at the address. When they arrived at the destination, the straw shed, just as they were about to break in, the people inside seemed to have noticed and fired shots outwards, dense like beads. The Civil Defense Corps members quickly dispersed and retreated, without retaliating. They only focused on the movements inside the straw shed and waited until dawn. Suddenly, two or three people in the straw shed peeked out, seemingly trying to escape. The Civil Defense Corps immediately opened fire, killing Xu Yongnian, a native of Jiangbei. Xu's wife, Xu Chen, filed a petition with the local court, requesting an investigation and justice for her husband, claiming that her husband made a living by working and did not commit theft. The court sent personnel to examine the coffin. Subsequently, Prosecutor Yang Qi ordered the Civil Defense Corps members Zhang Tai'an and Yang Yuanxing to be interrogated. After a clear investigation, the Criminal Court was prosecuted. Judge Yang Qianchang held a public trial and sentenced Zhang and Yang to a fine of 500 yuan each. The private prosecution part was also sentenced to 500 yuan each. Zhang and Yang, dissatisfied with the sentence, appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court. However, the original sentence was upheld. Zhang and Yang, still dissatisfied, appealed to the Supreme Court in the capital and submitted various reasons. As a result, the case was sent back to the Suzhou Higher Court for rehearing. The court opened the hearing the other day and ordered Zhang Tai'an, Yang Yuanxing, the deceased's wife Xu Chen, and others to wait in Suzhou for the hearing. Zhang and Yang hired lawyers Pan Zhensheng and Wu Shanzeng to defend them. It was also heard that Zhu Maosong, the platoon leader of the Civil Defense Corps, testified in court that the bandits had fired first, so they retaliated. Peng Wenwei, the patrol officer from the local police station, testified that the police had arrived at the scene and the person had already been killed. As a result, the court decided to order Zhang Tai'an and others to remain on bail pending further testimony. It was heard that the previously arrested robber Zhu A'si had been sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the headquarters and had already been released after serving his term.</p>
<p>Neighborhood Quarrel</p>
<h3>Issue of Miscarriage Arises</h3>
<p>A medical examiner must be sent for examination. Huan Jiaju, a 52-year-old man from Yancheng who resides in a straw shed in Xiaoshadu, Lime Kiln, West Shanghai, makes a living as a laborer. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, at 2 p.m., he got into an argument with his neighbor Yang Zhenlin from Funing over a minor matter. After a mutual fight, Huan immediately called the police and took Yang to the Sixth District, accusing Yang of assault and robbery of 12 yuan from his pocket. The criminal district officer separately interrogated them and determined that there was no evidence to support Huan's accusation that Yang had robbed him of money. However, Yang had used violence and was sentenced to a fine and released. Three days later, the wife of Yang Zhenlin, Yang Hu (32 years old), took Huan Jiaju to the Sixth District, accusing Huan of kicking her in the stomach when she tried to stop the fight between Huan and her husband, causing internal injuries and the sudden abortion of a three-month-old fetus. She requested a thorough investigation. After the criminal district officer questioned her separately, he ordered the police car to send her (along with the aborted fetus) to the Red Cross Hospital for examination. After examination by the doctor, it was determined that the fetus was only three months old and was a blood clot. It would be necessary to send the fetus to the Zhenru forensic examiner for examination in a few days to determine the truth. Yesterday, a document was prepared and sent to the headquarters for investigation. It was heard that Yang Hu was dissatisfied that her husband had been fined, so she falsely accused Huan of assault and miscarriage as a form of retaliation.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Privately Forming an Organization to Collect Money</h3>
<p>Hu Guozhi, a representative of the Nanjing Gendarmerie Headquarters, reported to the French Concession Police the other day, accompanied by detectives from the Public Security Bureau. He stated that Yang Wensheng from Guizhou, who resides in the No. 710 dormitory of the YMCA, had privately organized a Shanghai Office of the Nanjing Gendarmerie Headquarters, secretly used official titles, collected money, and sold official titles. He requested that the case be proposed for extradition and interrogation. The head of the police instructed the detectives to cooperate and arrest Yang. However, there was no evidence. The next morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer stated that the case had not been fully investigated and requested a rescheduling for another interrogation. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled for verification.</p>

<h3>Please Dismiss the Magistrate of Chongde County</h3>
<p>Because petitions for rain led to shootings and multiple deaths, the All-Zhejiang Public Association sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which reads: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government: Reports state that on the morning of the 19th, the people of Chongde County petitioned the county government for rain. County Magistrate Mao Gaokun led the security corps to suppress them. The security corps opened fire, killing two civilians, and two more were trampled to death in the ensuing chaos, with over ten injured. Furthermore, reports also state that the county magistrate, aware of his culpability, fabricated telegrams about banditry to request the dispatch of troops, hoping to instigate a major crackdown. At a time like this, during a severe drought when people are praying for rain, even if there were instances of gathering a crowd for coercion, it should have been addressed with kind words and guidance. There should not have been such abuse of power, treating lives as expendable. In the previous conflict involving the police and civilians in Jiaxing, the people support the police to protect them, but now the police are turning against the people, which is outrageous. Furthermore, the magistrate dares to falsely accuse the local populace and request the dispatch of troops, intending to harm the people in order to cover up his crime of deceiving them. His intentions are sinister and deserve the most severe punishment. We urge that the Magistrate of Chongde County be immediately dismissed and brought to justice. At the same time, issue a directive to all corps and police agencies that, in the future, should the public gather for parades or petitions, even if there are inappropriate actions, they must not arbitrarily open fire without cause to harm the people." The Shanghai All-Zhejiang Public Association respectfully kowtows.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor: Upon reading your newspaper today, in the local news column of this month's 22nd, there was an article titled (Owners of Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, Voluntarily Reduce Rent, According to a Report from the Rent Reduction Association). After reading it, I was deeply shocked. It turns out that the tenants of Ren'an Lane initiated the rent reduction movement more than half a year ago. Since joining the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Association, minutes have been taken at every meeting. Documents and letters for meetings are always stamped with the Ren'an Lane Branch Seal. The so-called report from the Rent Reduction Association is completely fictitious. Therefore, the members of the branch are very angry and have first sent a letter to the Rent Reduction Association to inquire who made the false report for negotiation. The rent reduction matter is only being negotiated by Mr. Xu, a representative sent by the owner. In addition, the named reporter, Chen Guan, also lacks sincerity. All the reports that all tenants requested to pay rent at 80% of the original amount from June are extremely absurd. Moreover, the tenants are based on the fourth item of the General Association's rent reduction regulations, paying rent at 60% from January of this year. This is because the housing in Ren'an Lane is narrow and shallow, and the rent is expensive, which is different from other places. In addition, the owner has never been seen, and there are many barriers in between. The conditions set by Mr. Xu, the representative sent, are harsh, forcing old tenants to pay rent at 80%, requiring tenants to pay for tap water, and requiring a deposit of thirty taels of silver for a water meter. There are also special quirks, old tenants use the excuse of exchanging insurance policies to demand 20% of the small rent, and new tenants who want to rent need to ask for a small rent of one month, plus an opening fee of thirty yuan, and small opening fees. Therefore, not only are there no new tenants, but old tenants are also not allowed. From this, we can infer that Mr. Xu is instigating this, using all kinds of tricks with the sole purpose of collecting money. Therefore, we should ask you to correct this quickly, which would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee, Ren'an Lane Branch, Guling Road, July 22, 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Respected Editor, The news published in the evening newspapers of the 21st and the daily newspapers of the 22nd regarding the President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, formally denying the resignation message, stated, "On the morning of the 19th of this month, three reporters simultaneously visited Mr. Yu. Because at that time he happened to want to refute the rumors from the outside, he briefly expressed his recent feelings. Unexpectedly, due to the language barrier, a misunderstanding occurred," etc. After investigation, the three people who visited President Yu on the morning of the 19th were Sun Diesun, Jian Qiao, and Yihe. Mr. Yu personally met with them and talked at length about the Control Yuan's impeachment of the Gu case, which lasted for an hour. Among them, there were those that could be published and those that could not be published. Therefore, after Mr. Yu finished speaking, he repeated the ones that could be published. Mr. Yu was deeply afraid that there would be errors in listening, so he ordered Jian Qiao to recite the sentences that could be published. At that time, Mr. Yu thought that there were no errors. According to the statement in the manuscript that "a misunderstanding occurred due to language," I don't know what it is based on. Moreover, the reporter from the News Evening Post of the 21st met Mr. Yu and asked about the truth of the resignation. Mr. Yu did not mention that the colleagues had heard wrong at that time, which further proves that Mr. Yu's people (who?) formally denied the message, based solely on the reporter's speculation. Because it is related to the reputation of colleagues, I specially write a letter to state the process. Please publish it in the letter column. Sincerely, Reuters reporter Xu Jianqiao, Datong News Agency reporter Xu Yihe, Dabaisha reporter Ni Diesun, together.</p>

<h3>The Origin of the Bodhi Society</h3>
<p>Sentient beings are often afflicted with various sufferings, which arise in accordance with karma. They are completely unaware. The five defilements are increasing, and they are particularly severe now. The great disasters that are felt are so tragic, how can they be described? The origin of these troubles lies in the beginningless clinging to the self. Because each clings to the self, the unity of the whole is disrupted. Greed, anger, arrogance, and jealousy are indulged and advanced. The superior defeats the inferior, and they devour each other. People fight with people, and countries are enemies with countries. Love, anger, gratitude, and resentment are repaid without end. This arises as that declines, and that survives as this perishes. Dreams are impermanent, and things flow without ceasing. Alas, sentient beings, it is difficult to escape the illness of karma. Worldly wisdom is exhausted, and there is no way to remedy it. Only the Great Physician King has equal great compassion. He sees all sentient beings as his beloved children. They gather in a burning house, happily playing. He deeply pities their ignorance and skillfully leads them to liberation. He follows their faculties and teaches the Dharma, for the sake of great enlightenment, so that they may be freed from all suffering and attain ultimate bliss. Starting from the causal ground, he treats afflictions. He observes suffering and gives rise to compassion, taking the benefit of others as his task. He observes the self-nature of the Dharma, habitually unites with enlightenment. Furthermore, there is a key point: to attain Buddhahood in this very life. What is enlightened nature? What is the aspect of self and other? What Dharma benefits others? How is it ultimately attained? It is said that there is learning, and there are many expedient means.</p>
<p>The ten wholesome dharmas are to be learned by humans and gods. The four noble truths are to be learned by those of the Hearer vehicle. The twelve links of dependent origination are to be learned by those of the middling vehicle. The six perfections and four means of conversion are to be learned by bodhisattvas. Although the ultimate fruit of the lesser vehicle is said to be "no learning," it is not ultimate except for the Thus Come One. The three trainings of morality, concentration, and wisdom encompass all learning. Each is enhanced to attain the state of no learning. For the extent of future time, he turns to teach others to learn. The Paramita vehicle requires learning for three asamkhya kalpas. The Vajra vehicle requires complete learning in this very life. Common and uncommon paths depend on the arising of the mind of learning, on learning to practice, and on learning to attain realization. The superior, middling, and inferior teachings are taught according to the capacities of beings, and the superior, middling, and inferior are learned accordingly. Those who learn the lesser vehicle are guided by the ten wholesome actions, and they are moved by impermanence and suffering, quickly cultivating liberation. The learning of the greater vehicle still begins with the ten wholesome actions and liberation, as well as great compassion and correct view. Those who practice the Mantra vehicle must first cultivate the ten wholesome actions, liberation, great compassion, and correct view, and then enter the esoteric, arising completeness, cessation and contemplation in union, learning the supreme learning. From the beginning with humans and gods, up to becoming a Buddha, ascending in sequence, one should learn in order. There are also those with sudden capacities, who understand as soon as they hear. Their learning is faster, but it still does not deviate from this. It is not abandoning the middling and inferior to take the superior alone, not abandoning worldly truth to take ultimate truth alone. The lesser, greater, essential, and phenomenal, the exoteric and esoteric Dharma teachings, the worldly and supramundane, all are equally to be learned. Entering the bodhisattva's learning is for learning enlightenment. Among these, distinguishing between learning and non-learning, dwelling in the stream of the sages, belittling humans and gods, naming oneself the great vehicle, being ashamed to speak of the lesser vehicle, priding oneself on the phenomenal, neglecting correct view, boasting of doctrinal insight, neglecting the teachings, or criticizing the greater vehicle as not actually being taught by the Buddha, or suspecting esoteric words as not being sacred standards, or adhering to the Vinaya, saying that the esoteric is not pure conduct, or honoring the Dharani, saying that the exoteric is not ultimate, clinging to schools and arising disputes, and giving rise to great wrong views. Such learners fall into limitless faults. Presumptuous use of one's own intelligence is not called good learning.</p>
<p>When the supreme teachings flowed eastward, worthy sages arose in succession. According to the faculties of beings, they spread the teachings, and the schools gradually prospered. Among them, the esoteric vehicle remained in the world for only about a hundred years. The western regions were dangerous and remote, with ten thousand miles in between. The virtuous masters Xuanzang and Yijing aspired to distant expeditions. Although much was obtained, translation was incomplete. After the Huichang persecution, the sounds of Sanskrit were faint. The masters Shihu and others only showed a small part of the whole, symbolizing the sacred scope, less than one-tenth. Later generations arose with no one to follow, each guarding one corner. Arising the mind and practicing, they only sought to not retreat. Attaining Buddhahood with a single word brought both fear and amazement. Establishing a school with a single doctrine was always dissatisfied and incomplete. Even less were there skillful means. Those with aspirations looked to the ocean with longing. Doctrine triumphed over practice, and practice sighed with extinction and absence. They were trapped in a confined and narrow state. A great collection of all these was needed.</p>
<p>Great was Snow Mountain, adjacent to the sacred realm. Masters and disciples came and went, searching far and wide. Forming an alliance with Tara opened its first river. Chisong Dezhen continued its great cause. Bodhisattva exhausted his efforts in management. The Paramita vehicle was established at that time. Guru Rinpoche subdued demons and outsiders, with all kinds of miraculous transformations, revealing the greatness of the exoteric and esoteric paths. The creations of the five Indies flowed like rivers through the ages, reaching perfect excellence during the Song Dynasty. The nectar flowed abundantly, and people and Dharma flowed together. Vast and expansive, they converged in Tibet. Master Atisha, carrying the complete treasure, used "A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment" to clarify its great principles. The seven divisions of the esoteric vehicle were brilliantly and completely prepared. Later learners flourished. This was its expedient arising. Master Tsongkhapa gathered together the great completion, reviving the precepts, and emphasizing both the exoteric and esoteric. First, the path to enlightenment, and then the Vajra path. These two sequences form its ultimate scope. The Buddhist scriptures and treatises of both Sanskrit and Tibetan are completely proclaimed. The commentaries of the line of sacred ones make it even more rich. The three monasteries have regular rules, and the five treatises are studied comprehensively. Those with medium wisdom diligently cultivate for twenty years. Those who violated the prohibitions were expelled. As if limited by graduation, they were allowed to enter the esoteric. Advancing gradually step by step, there was no presumption or transgression. There were also sudden transcendences, but these were not the proper order. Therefore, the three types of individuals are opened up, entering in order. They merge the five vehicles, without mixing them up. The esoteric is divided into four classes, with preparatory practices and main practices. The rules and regulations are carefully observed, even more so than in the exoteric. From entering the holy from the ordinary, the order of learning and cultivation, up to attaining Buddhahood, is clearly consistent. What follows must include what preceded. The great ocean receives all rivers. Humility ascends to height, and the many stars surround the moon. The divergences of the three times and five times are eliminated. The disputes between the exoteric and esoteric teachings are dispelled. The teacher has a lineage, and the received teachings are without doubt or hesitation. Contentious arguments are forever extinguished, and the true Dharma is forever bright. If one does not learn this, where else will one go? Qinghai and Mongolia inherited Tibet, promoting and developing it in sequence, each equally excelling the other.</p>
<p>The Panchen Lama, observing the causes and conditions, came to this world for the Dharma. It was as if he was repaying his original vows. Flying his staff south and north, he saw deeply into the subtle and obscure. He was able to tame the difficult to tame, and he gave earnest teachings. Linking the Han and Tibetan regions was like continuing a road with a bridge. Bearing the true teachings was like the sun shining in the sky. A great proclamation was made, that politics and religion should rely on each other. The five sciences should be learned, and the true and conventional should be equally governed. If one wants to turn back the raging waves, the teachings must come first. With all making important vows, the society was established.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the rare treasures of the ancient sages of the western regions can be moved and become a permanent residence in the eastern lands. Giving medicine according to the illness is the right time now. To save what is corrupt and supplement what is biased, how can it be avoided? Respectfully following the teacher's instructions, there are four aspects: First, transmission and reception, with the utmost importance placed on the teacher's lineage. Second, cultivation and learning, carefully gathering wealth and disciples. Third, translation, greatly proclaiming the true Dharma. Fourth, benefiting the world, universally saving humans and gods. Many outstanding talents should be selected to study in Tibet. A fundamental place of practice should be selected and built. This is the first and most urgent task at present. A target should be set as the course of progress. However, this matter is vast and profound. Benefiting self and others, the principles are complex. A single day or night is difficult to accomplish. How can one hand or foot complete it? It is hoped that all</p>
<p>talented individuals will make great vows, bear heavy responsibilities and travel far, cooperate with each other, either assisting with Dharma wealth or widely soliciting donations. The four kinds of giving should be equally bestowed, and the seven assemblies should receive grace. During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the ancient virtuous ones had great vows, but the great cause was not completed. Now it should be resumed. The ancient ways of Nalanda and Vikramashila should be inherited. The beauty of Serta Larung should not be allowed to remain unique. May the sacred teachings flourish, and may the hearts of all be greatly transformed. When the culture is ripe, its governance will surely be prosperous. Politics and religion will assist each other, having both substance and function. It is hoped that shared karma will be eliminated, and danger will be turned into safety. May dragons and gods protect, and may the country be peaceful. Benefiting all spirits, not just humanity, may all Buddhas rejoice and call it great auspiciousness. May all sentient beings, both sentient and non-sentient, together perfect all wisdom. Thus, I reveal the causes and conditions, awaiting guidance and direction.

<p>Reading Q &amp; A</p>
<h3>Explanations of Several Questions in Economics</h3>
<p>|| Answer to Mr. Song Hongxiang ||</p>
<p>Question: What is the process from barter to commodity production?</p>
<p>Answer: The process from barter to commodity production must go through the stage of the emergence of money. The development of social productivity leads to an increase in the types of products. The method of barter becomes very inconvenient for people. Therefore, people gradually choose a more durable thing from various products as a regular exchange standard. This thing later developed into money. After the monetary system is established, people who produce for exchange regard their products as commodities and take them to the market to sell. This starts commodity production.</p>
<p>Question: The transition from barter to the opposition between use value and value is the unfolding of a contradiction. Commodity production is the unity of opposites of use value and value. However, the commodity itself is also a contradictory and moving subject. How is the dialectic explanation of the transition from commodity to money to capital?</p>
<p>Answer: Money is originally a kind of commodity. Money is separated from commodities and becomes a common medium of commodities, forming an opposition to commodities. However, commodities can be converted into money at any time (that is, selling commodities), and money can also be converted into commodities at any time (that is, buying commodities). This is the unity of opposites of commodities and money. There is also a special commodity among commodities, that is, labor power. Labor power can produce surplus value. When money is converted into this kind of commodity (that is, buying labor power), its nature changes suddenly and can generate profits. When money is used for the purpose of generating profits, it is no longer ordinary money, but capital. This is the dialectical movement of money, commodities, and capital.</p>
<p>Question: Where exactly is surplus value produced? Is it produced from use value or from value?</p>
<p>Answer: Surplus value is produced from surplus labor. Surplus value is the exchange value (or simply value) of surplus labor, not use value. Therefore, it can also be said that surplus value is produced from value.</p>
<p>Question: The circulation of money as capital is an end in itself. When capital exists for capital's sake, its movement is limitless. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>Answer: This sentence means that when money is used as capital, because the purpose of capital is to constantly generate surplus value, this money must also constantly circulate and move. Circulation becomes the purpose of money capital. If the capital does not lose its meaning as capital, it must continue to move forever without limit.</p>
<p>Question: The value of a commodity is determined by the amount of labor necessary for its production. This necessary amount of labor is the labor power embodied in reality, that is, the commodity. In other words, the value of a commodity can be determined by the value of labor power. Is this interpretation correct?</p>
<p>Answer: This interpretation is correct.</p>

It is also hoped that you will forward the notification separately and invite them widely. For those students who have not yet joined the association, it is especially hoped that you will notify them to complete the membership registration formalities with the association before the meeting so that they can attend." It is also heard that if a large number of members come to Beijing to attend the meeting and the members' dormitory is not enough to accommodate them, it is planned to borrow the gymnasium of the alma mater as a temporary reception place.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Instruction</p>
<h3>Municipal Primary Schools to Report Budget Estimates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed all municipal primary schools, saying that the academic year will begin soon, and all municipal schools should re-create the budget expenditure estimates for the 23rd year and submit them to the bureau for approval. In addition to separate orders, the expenditure, budget form in duplicate, temporary fee form in duplicate, and teacher survey form in duplicate are hereby issued. You are ordered to create and report them before August 10th within the time limit, so as to collect and verify them. From the 23rd year onwards, the class teachers must be full of 1,100 points in principle, and no more specialist subjects should be hired to disperse the class distribution.

Now that the academic year has been renewed, each school should appoint teachers separately. The eighth registration of primary school teachers will be held. Anyone who has the qualifications stipulated in the Provisional Measures for the Registration of Primary School Teachers of the Bureau and is willing to serve as a primary school teacher in the city shall fill out two registration forms in person from August 1st to August 7th, excluding holidays, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and Saturday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and submit graduation certificates, service certificates, etc. for verification.

<p>The science teachers of the city's secondary schools</p>
<h3>Summer Training Class Opens</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held in the morning. Director Pan delivered a speech and 96 people reported. The training will start today. The summer training class for science teachers in secondary schools in the city held an opening ceremony at Jiaotong University at 9:00 AM yesterday. Director Pan and Section Chief Chen of the Municipal Education Bureau, President Li of Jiaotong University, President Cao of Datong University, and more than 90 students attended. Classes will start today. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Director's Report</h3>
<p>The ceremony was held as usual. First, Chairman Pan reported, saying that the Ministry of Education, in view of the statistics of the secondary school graduation examinations in various provinces and cities last year, found that the level of mathematics and science subjects in various schools was relatively poor, so it tried to gradually improve the level of mathematics and science in various schools. On the one hand, it promulgated the standard for science equipment in secondary schools, notifying various provinces and cities that they should meet the prescribed standard at the minimum. On the other hand, it stipulated methods and designated several universities to hold summer training classes for science teachers in stages. In Shanghai, Jiaotong University and Datong University jointly organized the training. The Education Bureau also sent personnel to participate in the preparation. It is divided into four subjects: mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry. According to the original method, all science teachers in secondary schools in Shanghai should register to participate. It is estimated that there are about 300 people. Those who are not teachers in secondary schools but are willing to participate can also register. Therefore, the total should be more than 300 people. Since the start of registration, some teachers have asked to be exempted from admission due to returning home and other reasons. However, very few people have been approved for exemption according to the regulations. Those who have not been approved should participate. As of yesterday, a total of 96 people have registered, which is only one-third of the total. It has been decided to start classes from tomorrow. It is hoped that those who have not participated within a week after the start of the class will come quickly and can continue to be accommodated. However, those who have not been approved for exemption and do not participate will be dealt with by the Education Bureau.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu did not attend yesterday due to business. Director Pan delivered a speech on his behalf, saying that the Mayor pays great attention to the science courses in secondary schools. He hopes that in the future, education should not focus on literature, but should focus on natural science, so that students can build a good foundation in science in secondary schools. It will be convenient for them to go to school or find employment in the future. To improve the science of secondary schools, the science equipment should be gradually improved according to the standard to make it more complete. At the same time, I hope that you will work hard in the training class. You must recognize that this is not for yourself, but for the progress of the school. This is what the Mayor asked me to say to you. I hope you will work hard.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Speeches</h3>
<p>President Li of Jiaotong University said in his speech that in order to run a university well, secondary schools must be run well. The training class is to improve the level of science. I hope everyone will work together to make it possible for universities and secondary schools to cooperate. President Cao of Datong University said in his speech that secondary school science teachers have a great responsibility. It is the foundation of scientific development. Everyone should not underestimate themselves, work hard to study, and do the work of saving the country through science and revitalizing the nation. Xu Mingcai, director of the Department of Chemistry of Jiaotong University, said in his speech that the mission of the training class is (1) to pay attention to the new developments in teaching, (2) to discuss teaching materials, (3) to solve the difficulties of teaching, and (4) to connect the feelings of universities and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Dong Renjian of the Children's Education Society Talks</p>
<h3>Hubei Education Progresses Very Quickly</h3>
<p>Education funds are issued monthly and are not in arrears. Education comrades are very research-oriented and sincerely cooperate in children's education. The Chinese Children's Education Society held its fifth annual meeting in Hubei this year with great success. It has been reported in the previous newspapers. Now the members are returning to Shanghai one after another. The Shanghai agency reporter visited Mr. Dong Renjian, a director of the association who had just returned from the annual meeting, and asked about his impression of education in Hubei Province and the future facilities for children's education. According to him, the annual education funds in Hubei Province are more than 1.9 million yuan. Since Mr. Cheng Qibao, the director of the Education Department, took office, the education funds have been issued monthly and are not in arrears. On the passive side, he has cleaned up the school property and eliminated long-standing malpractices, which has been quite effective. As a result, the lives of teachers are relatively stable and their services are adequately guaranteed. In terms of quality, the schools in the three towns have made rapid progress, and the people in various places have also made many new achievements.

In addition, the handicraft course of the school has always been famous for its embroidery. From the next semester, the level will be improved and incorporated into the senior high school vocational course. The women's adult class, which was originally established for adult women to make up for their studies, will continue to be held in the next semester, but it will be divided into full-day and half-day groups so as not to conflict with housework and to have more opportunities to study. The entire school building has been repaired recently.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Women's School</h3>
<p>Minsheng Women's Primary School on Avenue Joffre, Route Bayle (formerly Minsheng Women's School) has long been famous at home and abroad for its strict management and serious teaching. It was founded during the Xinhai Revolution and has been 23 years since then. Graduates are scattered in various places to serve, no less than thousands of people. Ms. Hu Yunyin, the principal, is very interested in education and her school-running spirit is getting stronger recently. Yesterday, for the training and teaching problems of the next semester, all the teachers and teachers were convened to attend the meeting and discuss for about three hours. It is heard that the two points of students' character and level were discussed in the most detail during the meeting. The number of students was also slightly expanded, and an adult women's remedial class was added to broaden education.</p>
<h3>Hubei Middle School</h3>
<p>The number of students in Hubei Middle School on Qiujiang Road has increased sharply in recent years, and the original school building is not enough to accommodate them. Therefore, in the previous month, a complete primary school building was built on the east side of the open space. The project is progressing very rapidly. It is expected that it will be moved in and used in the autumn. In view of the urgent need in fact, the school is also building a large auditorium on the north side of the open space so that all the students of the school can gather at the same time. It is also learned that the school has expanded the number of students and widely recruited new students due to the completion of the new school building.</p>
<h3>Qinghua Primary and Secondary School</h3>
<p>Qinghua Primary and Secondary School on Park Road has been in operation for many years. This year, the Chinese Children's Middle School of the Public Works Department enrolled scholarship students, and the school has successively admitted as many as three students. Principal Feng Shuhua pays special attention to the school's hygiene. It is heard that from this semester, the school's meals will be divided into separate meals. Teachers and students in the school must hold tickets to select from the kitchen for each meal. The tableware for each person is extremely isolated. This is an innovation in schools in Shanghai, which will benefit students' hygiene a lot. In addition, the school's summer school this year has now started. Classes are held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The classrooms are equipped with electric fans and the tuition is low. Those who are interested in remedial classes can still enroll. It is said that Mr. Xu Jiachen has been appointed as the director of teaching affairs in the school for the next semester. Mr. Xu graduated from Daxia Education College and has served as an assistant teacher in the school and the principal of Haimen Normal School. This appointment is very popular.</p>
<h3>Huahua Middle School</h3>
<p>Huahua Middle School on Yuyuan Road has been in operation for eleven years. Recently, Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Boyuan, Huang Yanfang, Liu Pinsan, Xu Maotang, Mao Heyuan, Chen Runyong, Zhu Shien, and Wu Jingxiong have been appointed as directors to jointly plan the construction of a new school building for expansion.</p>
<h3>Qingguang Primary School Plans to Build a School Building</h3>
<p>Song Jianqing, the principal of Qingguang Primary School and Kindergarten in West Shanghai, is enthusiastic about education and has been operating for three years with remarkable results. With the decision of the board of directors, the construction of a school building is being planned. The board of directors submitted a report to the Municipal Education Bureau to transfer it to the Municipal Government for filing, and organized the Qingguang Primary School Construction Committee. The donation brochure, temporary receipt, and three-part form used have all been submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau. After verification and issuance, the fundraising procedures will be carried out. The school's regular publications will publish a special issue on the construction of the school building. Many people in this city who are enthusiastic about education have written inscriptions and co-sponsored the charity. It is said that more than 50 inscriptions have been received from Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Wen Hongen, Chu Minyi, Wang Boqun, Yuan Lidun, Yang Hu, Ye Kaixin, Gu Tongqi, Zheng Xigu, Wang Yamao, and others, and will be published soon. The new school building site is currently being discussed with local real estate companies.</p>
<p>Young Writers</p>
<h3>The Breeze Literary Society is Established</h3>
<p>The Breeze Literary Society, initiated by young writers Zhu Xiaochun, Xing Huimin, Mei Zi, and Lai Ziwen, held its founding meeting at Shanghai Women's Middle School on Zhizaoju Road, Xieqiao, at 9:00 AM yesterday. More than 50 members attended. Zhu Xiaochun chaired the meeting. Chi recorded the meeting as usual. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and the preparation process, and then began to discuss the charter and the following important motions: (1) Lu Xun advocated Proletarian literature, promoted class struggle, endangered national security, and national survival. How should the society express its attitude? (Resolved) To announce his crimes to all sectors of the country and notify all parts of the country.</p>
<p>Young writers unanimously condemned him. (2) Lin Yutang advocated humorous literature, undermined national consciousness, and indulged in empty talk to harm the country. How should the society express its attitude? (Resolved) To handle it with the previous case. (2) How should the society unite young writers from all over the country to launch a general attack on romantic, decadent, feudal enslavement, and Proletarian literature? (Resolved) Passed and handed over to the executive committee for handling. When discussing the above motions, each member gave enthusiastic speeches and the atmosphere was tense, which was unprecedented. Then the officers were elected, including Zhu Xiaochun as the president, Zhu Xiaochun and Huang Jing'an as the general affairs, Tong Chimin and Wu Shijun as the organization, Xing Huimin as the publication, Lai Ziwen and Gao Wanbai as the literary affairs, Su Chunlian and Liu Liu as the drama affairs, Mei Zi and Sheng Maliang as the film affairs, Teng Baiye and Cheng Liusang as the aesthetics and health affairs, and Chen Dongbai and Zhu Zhiming as the intelligence affairs. Finally, the congress passed the declaration as follows:</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>We deeply know that today's literary world in China is surrounded by the two major forces of Proletarian literature and decadent literature. We also deeply know that the so-called writers in today's literary world in China are all despicable and wicked national moths with ulterior motives. They only know how to indulge in the paradise of gold and hope to permanently occupy the dominant position in the literary world. Therefore, in a peaceful environment, they constantly stir up trouble and try to create a tense atmosphere in the literary world, such as the "Shanghai School," "Beijing School," and "Ping School" disputes, and the "Classical Chinese," "Vernacular Chinese," and "Mass Language" debates, all of which are their ugly performances of deliberately mystifying and using despicable means. At the same time, on the other hand, they try their best to embellish idols, the so-called "Boss" and the so-called "Master." In their planned promotion, they are nothing more than creating their status as monarchs and scholar-officials in the literary world, so that under their violent oppression, the general pure and excellent authors will never have a chance to stand up. The current semi-colonial China can be said to have encountered the most difficult situation. The ferocious imperialists are frantically plundering and dividing the spoils there. The brutal bandits are even more making trouble and doing evil there, resulting in rural bankruptcy, factory closures, and commercial decline, making our entire country and society fall into a state of imminent destruction. In this unprecedentedly serious period, all the Proletarian literature and decadent literature in today's literary world are not only unsuitable for the needs of society, but also affect the survival of the country. Therefore, we should raise the banner of revolution and declare the death penalty without hesitation to these idols in the literary world and the literary works that deteriorate thoughts and do not fit the environment of this era. At the same time, we must rectify our ranks and actively build a new literary work that is conscious, upward, and in line with the needs of society and the survival of the country.</p>
<p>What history has shown us is that the success of a literary work is never an accidental product, but must have its objective conditions to determine its fate of development or decline. For example, after the Renaissance, Romanticism defeated Classicism, and Naturalism defeated Romanticism, all of which are good historical facts for us. Since all the literary works in China's literary world today cannot meet the needs of the times, then the decline of these idol writers, the collapse of boring literary works, and the development of our revolutionary ranks and the success of the new literary movement are inevitable results. Here, we have gathered a large team of loyal and brave revolutionary fighters, ready to rush to the front line, willing to unconditionally sacrifice blood and spirit to promote our new literary movement. At the same time, in a solemn position and rational judgment, we are not under the command of any party. In the course of our work, we are not afraid of power and do not fear difficulties. We will eliminate all obstacles with revolutionary means. Finally, we warmly hope that revolutionary comrades who sympathize with us will come and join this great camp.</p>
<p>It is heard that the society will hold its first executive meeting on the 25th of this month. Before the address of the society is determined, it will be temporarily located at No. 22 Chengyu Lane, Lafayette Road, Route Lafayette as the communication address.</p>

<h3>New Tennis Techniques (12)</h3>
<p>By J. PARMLY PARET, Originally Written; Jointly Translated by Qian Yiqin and Hong Jun | Copyright Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited |</p>
<p>As for talking about the Top-Spinned Stroke, this striking method is to give the ball the most important topspin.  When striking, the swing of the racket is upward. After hitting the ball, the racket should swing all the way over the left shoulder, and to maximize the swing force needed to handle any dropping ball. Therefore, when deciding to use this method, the racket should be pre-swung all the way back behind and above the right shoulder. Generally speaking, the length of the racket's pre-swing back should be exactly equal to the length of the racket's forward swing after hitting the ball. The timing of the racket's pre-swing back should be precisely calculated. Under no circumstances should the racket pause in the back before executing the strike. Therefore, the backswing should immediately follow with the forward swing without any pause. Such a light and agile back-and-forth swing can produce excellent results when striking. The swing style of William M. Johnston of California, a world-renowned master of forehand strokes, is worthy of imitation. He always twists his wrist as soon as the racket swings back, making the racket trace a small circle in the back, and then continues to swing forward. Thus, the back-and-forth swing of the racket is actually continuous. Tilden also uses this method, but the circle he traces in the back is smaller and flatter. All other players who have used this method have achieved considerable success, which proves that it is very effective.</p>
<p>When the incoming ball is about to bounce after landing, the player's body should immediately swing downward along with the hand motion. Then, the power of the shoulders is transmitted first, followed by the upper arm, forearm, wrist, and racket, all swinging forcefully like cracking a whip. Thus, there is great power when striking. This principle of swinging the body is exactly the same as when throwing a basketball. When a basketball master prepares to throw a long shot, his technique and body swing must follow the same procedures: the shoulders rotate first, then the upper arm swings, then the forearm extends, and then the wrist throws the ball. In this way, the power is transferred in turn step by step, so when the wrist officially throws the ball, the ball flies out with great speed and power.</p>
<p>This kind of body swing must be smooth and agile, without any stagnation. Therefore, the position of the feet must follow the principles mentioned in Chapter Two, which is that the feet should be parallel to the trajectory of the incoming ball. This does not mean that the toes of both feet should be parallel to the trajectory of the incoming ball, but rather that the toes facing the trajectory of the ball should be approximately perpendicular. The feet are spread apart, standing on parallel lines. Thus, by pre-turning the body to a convenient position, the swing of the body when executing the strike of the incoming ball will not be stagnant.</p>
<p>Davis Cup Inter-Zone Final</p>
<h3>Australia Holds a Strong Advantage</h3>
<p>Consecutive Wins by Australian Singles Players (London, 21st, Reuters) On the first day of the Davis Cup tennis inter-zone final, Australia secured consecutive wins in the singles matches against the United States. Australia's chances of playing against Great Britain in the Challenge Round are almost certain. The Australia-US doubles match is scheduled for Monday. The results of the singles matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Crawford (Aus) {6-1, 6-2, 2-6, 10-8} Shields (US)</p>
<p>McGrath (Aus) {7-5, 6-4, 1-6, 9-7} Wood (US)</p>
<h3>Crawford Defeats Shields</h3>
<p>Crawford's serves were spectacularly brilliant on several occasions. His backhand shots forced Shields to run constantly along the baseline. His groundstrokes were also consistently superior. Shields' only weapon was his serve, but his volleys were very weak. He frequently hit very easy balls into the net. Crawford concentrated his efforts on the sideline shots, forcing Shields to retreat to the baseline. Crawford won the first set very easily. Shields made numerous errors in the second set, often sending easy balls into the net. Shields led twice in the third set, at 6-5 and 7-6, but ultimately failed to break Crawford's strong defensive line and lost.</p>
<h3>McGrath Defeats Wood</h3>
<p>McGrath's victory over Wood was entirely due to his two-handed backhand, which broke down Wood's best tactics. Towards the end, Wood's performance was extremely careless, casually sending countless easy forehand groundstrokes into the net. McGrath was very steady throughout the match. His backhand was heavy and powerful, and his forehand was also controllable. McGrath gave up the third set, but then concentrated all his efforts on the fourth set.</p>

<h3>Municipal Track and Field Competition Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Recently, Shanghai citizens have been studying track and field sports, which has gradually become more widespread. Track and field teams have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. However, each team is acting on its own, without any connection. Therefore, there is no overall organization. The sports meeting of Baihong, Zhonghua, and other five groups last month had a proposal for permanent existence. Later, due to the busy team affairs, they had no time to take care of it, resulting in suspension. The Postal Workers' Track and Field Team plans to connect the feelings of various teams in the city and seek to improve track and field achievements. A complete organization is indispensable. Therefore, they re-emphasized the previous proposal and initiated the Shanghai Municipal Track and Field Competition Promotion Association. The first meeting of representatives from various teams was convened at the Postal Workers' Club last Saturday. Those present included Kang Kongzhao from Baihong, Xu Duo from the Postal Workers, Sun Zhichong from Zhonghua, Kang Taiming and Luo Zhongshao from Huaguang, and Xie Hanliang from Liuxing. Xu Duo presided over the meeting, reported the purpose of the meeting, and agreed on the articles of association for the development of the association. Five executives were elected: Xu Duo for communication, Kang Taiming for documentation, He Yaozu for general affairs, Li Mindong for accounting, and Sun Zhichong for publicity. The detailed rules of the association will be drafted by the documentarian. It is heard that Li Minxun will convene the first executive meeting next week to verify everything. The association welcomes other teams in the city to participate. The office is temporarily located at the Postal Workers' Association in Ruitai Lane, North Sichuan Road. The association's articles of association are recorded as follows: Articles of Association of the Shanghai Municipal Track and Field Competition Promotion Association (1) Name: The name of this association is the Shanghai Municipal Track and Field Competition Promotion Association (abbreviated as Shanghai Municipal Track and Field Association). (2) Purpose: The purpose of this association is to connect the friendship of various track and field teams in the city and promote the development and progress of track and field competitions. (3) Organization: This association has five executives, organizing an executive committee to handle all the affairs of this association. The detailed rules for its operation will be formulated separately. (4) Association Affairs: The important affairs that this association should handle are briefly divided into the following four categories: (A) Organizing inter-team and joint sports meetings, or other various sports meetings. (B) Contacting and hosting famous track and field teams from other cities to come to Shanghai for competitions (C) Eliminating barriers and misunderstandings between teams and mediating disputes between teams. (D) Studying sports facilities, contributing to the sports authorities, and seeking the welfare of athletes. (5) Membership: Any track and field team in the city that is well-organized by Chinese citizens, approves of the purpose of this association, and applies for membership with a letter, which is approved by the executive committee, can be recognized as a formal member team. (6) Funding: All the expenses of this association, in addition to being borne equally by each member team, may be raised from the outside world as appropriate. (7) Advisors: This association may send letters to hire several leaders from various sectors of the city's party and government, as well as famous figures in sports, as honorary advisors of this association to guide all the activities of this association.</p>
<p>Summer Sports Training Class Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<h3>President Chu Minyi Attended and Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>All instructors of various subjects have been hired. The Sports Class Alumni Association of the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Sports Association, in order to promote the national sports implementation plan and implement the sports curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools, jointly organized a summer sports training class, which held its opening ceremony at Zhengfeng Middle School at 10:00 AM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Those who attended included President Chu Minyi, Mayor Wu's representative from the Municipal Government, Li Dachao, Director Pan's representative from the Education Bureau, Supervisor Shao Rugan, Supervisor Ma Chonggan, Director Yang Hu's representative from the Municipal Security Department, Wen Yiru, Lu Lihua, Huang Shengbai, Ruan Weicun, Gu Shunhua, Zhang Qidong, Du Yufei, Huang Jingwan, Weng Guoxun, and more than 100 trainees from the entire training class.</p>
<h3>President's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Chu Minyi, the president, reported that today is the opening ceremony of the summer sports training class. It is a great honor to have representatives from various institutions and guests attending the event. He himself has always attached great importance to sports, because the prerequisite for human survival is to have a healthy physique. Only with a healthy physique can one serve the society and the country. Therefore, if we want to revive the nation, we must promote sports. The Sports Class Alumni Association of the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Sports Association, in view of this, initiated the organization of the summer sports training class. With the support of the local authorities and the sports community, it was finally established. He is very grateful to Zhengfeng Middle School for allowing the use of classrooms and dormitories, and Jiaotong University for allowing the use of swimming pools and gyms, which has provided us with many conveniences.</p>
<h3>Representative Speeches</h3>
<p>Honorary Chairman Wu, the mayor's representative, Li Dachao, said that the summer sports training class is different from ordinary training classes, because it gathers primary and secondary school physical education teachers in one place to study various sports knowledge. Its purpose is not only to seek their own health, but also to shoulder the great responsibility of reviving the nation in the future. Yang Hu's representative, Wen Yiru, said briefly that with a strong physique, all undertakings can be carried out without obstacles. Therefore, the relationship between humans and sports is very important. However, there are many methods for studying sports. If we want to be economical, convenient, and appropriate, then nothing is better than national martial arts. Ma Chonggan, of the Municipal Education Bureau, said that Chinese people often think they are old and outdated when they reach their forties or fifties. In fact, the age of forty or fifty is the time when experience is rich and solid, and when we can do things with all our strength. The so-called old and outdated is actually the decline of physical fitness, the inability to constantly improve. Mr. Chu does not forget to improve, only to innovate, and never lags behind. Shao Rugan, of the Municipal Education Bureau, said briefly that the Sports Class Alumni Association of the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Sports Association, under the encouragement and guidance of Mr. Chu, organized a sports training class and spared no money or effort to serve. He admires this. The trainees sitting here voluntarily came to study. This spirit of improvement should be admired. As for the courses of the training class, they all conform to the path that the national sports community and primary and secondary schools should take. Although the period is short, the benefits should be great. There were also speeches by guests Weng Guoxun, Lu Lihua, and others.</p>
<h3>Hired Lecturers</h3>
<p>Finally, Zhang Qidong reported on the allocation of class hours for each course, a total of 170 hours. The lecturers are as follows: Principles of Physical Education Shao Rugan, Danish Gymnastics Du Yufei, Physical Education Teaching Method Lu Lihua, Sports Administration Ruan Weicun, Dance Yu Zidi, Mass Sports and Basketball Zhou Dingchang, Principles of Tai Chi Exercises and Health Education Chu Minyi, Essentials of National Health Zhang Qidong, Singing and Games and Women's Basketball Ren Jinghua, Apparatus Exercises Xu Jiazeng, Track and Field Huang Shengbai Wu Weishui, Men's and Women's Swimming Yu Rongbang Zhang Jiazhen, Group Exercises Zhu Shifang, Volleyball and Sports Physiology Gu Shunhua, Archery Jianzi Ye Yushu.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Huajie Small Ball Team (Published as is)</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: It is hereby stated that, according to Qin Anbang, the representative of the Huajie team, the team has been organized for ten years. In the sports news of yesterday (July 21st) regarding the Jiatang Cup competition, your newspaper published a news item stating that the Huajie team behaved poorly, that the players were all from the lower classes of society, and that the association, for the sake of the future of sports, should severely punish the Huajie team for its barbaric and bad behavior. After investigation, this is not in line with the facts. The team members have all received considerable education. How can they be from the lower classes of society? There is no bad behavior at all. This is nothing more than counter-propaganda to seize the right to compete. Your newspaper suddenly published it, with many inappropriate words. Furthermore, it is not known where this news was taken from. Therefore, we entrust your lawyer to send a letter requesting correction. Correspondingly, we hope that you will publish it in the letters to the editor column for correction. Sincerely, Mr. Editor of Shen Bao, Attorney Zhang Guoxian, July 22nd, 23rd Year,</p>

<h3>Seesaw for Poor Children</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Today I received an anonymous letter. On the left side of the envelope, it only said, "Sent from the French Concession of Shanghai, July 12th." When I opened it, it said:</p>
<p>Mr. Zikai:</p>
<p>Recently, I can see your illustrations almost every day in Free Talk. Your paintings are excellent. If you want to ask me how good they are, I can't say. In short, they are very thought-provoking.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I happened to see a few poor children playing. Their way of playing, I can quite use as the material for your paintings. And it is very in line with your usual style. Now I specially contribute it to you, for adoption. I wish you</p>
<p>Good health. A reader who admires you, July 11th?·</p>
<p>The Children's Way of Playing</p>
<p>| First put a</p>
<p>Long bench on the</p>
<p>Ground. Then take a</p>
<p>Long bench to span</p>
<p>On it. This</p>
<p>Way two children</p>
<p>Sit on the top</p>
<p>Two ends of a bench. Imitate the way of playing seesaw. Playing high and low.</p>
<p>This is an "unintentional" headless letter. It is presumed that the sender was purely compelled by the feeling of painting to write this letter to me. In the turbulent and crowded world today, this can be said to be a small anomaly.</p>
<p>There are words in the letter praising my paintings. I will publish the letter here as it is. People will say that this is like an advertisement for a pharmacy: Publishing a photo of a certain young master or a letter from a certain gentleman is nothing more than to show the effectiveness of Dr. Williams' Red Blood Pills. But I am also purely compelled by the emotion of this "poor children's way of playing" to draw this picture and write this manuscript. There is no way to be anonymous, so I don't care about all the suspicions.</p>
<p>When I close my eyes, I feel that what this anonymous correspondent has discovered is indeed the painting material that I love to take. So I took advantage of the excitement and copied a painting. These two poor children, with their careful ingenuity, used this ready-made material to create this specific and subtle sports equipment. In the environment of slums, this can be said to be a very excellent gaming equipment. I imagined that when these two poor children took one end of the bench and went up and down alternately, their faces must have been full of laughter. Because they are ignorant children, they have never dreamed of the various excellent and happy equipment specially prepared for children in the world's sports fields. They already know everything about this simple game, without knowing that the rice grown by his father has already been used up for paying food and taxes, and it is not his turn to eat it. The child who threw away the hard broad beans and clamored for meat dumplings only knows that meat dumplings are better than hard broad beans; he has them to eat, and I want to eat them too; he doesn't know at all. His mother's money earned from doing female work is not enough to buy rice. The child who hugged his father's bedding and shouted, "Dad bought good things!" only knows that his father should always bring good things home; he does not know that society has cut off the roots of their entire family with one knife, and soon he will become a small withered leaf. The child who hugged the rice straw firewood used as a cotton quilt and played with it as a foreign doll only felt that the pattern in the bed tonight was particularly fresh, and never thought of the sad reason and painful result of this change. The child on the back of the beggar woman is also very satisfied with moving as the day dictates. Only we outsiders feel the simplicity of this game and the poverty of these two children, they themselves do not know it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of the suffering of poor children in the world. In this society, poor adults are certainly suffering, but poor children are even more suffering! Poor adults suffer, and they can know their suffering, so they can try to avoid their suffering. Poor children suffer, and they cannot know their suffering, and cannot try to avoid their suffering, but blindly pursue the joy of life. This is the most tragic thing in the world!</p>
<p>Smelling the fragrance of food from the neighbor's house, unable to restrain his own cold stove, he cried to his mother for white rice to eat. Seeing the child next door eating meat dumplings, he threw away the hard broad beans in his hand and clamored "I want it too!" The father dropped his rice bowl and went home, and the child hugged! He brought back the bedding and shouted, "Dad bought good things!" The old cotton quilt was pawned, and the child hugged the newly added rice straw in the bed and played with it as a foreign doll. The child on the back of the beggar woman held his mother's shoes as a ball to play with; he laughed and talked to the angrily scolding non-donor. — When we see this kind of suffering and feel sympathy, what is most touching and heartbreaking is not the suffering of poor adults, but the suffering of poor children. Adults know their own suffering, and sympathizers only need to share it; children do not know their own suffering, and all of it must be borne by sympathizers. The child who clings to his own cold and shrunken head and asks his mother for white rice thinks that there should always be rice in the pot, and is completely unaware that his own life is rooted in the beggar that society does not tolerate, and is being rejected by others. It is really difficult to sympathize with a poor child who suffers but does not know suffering! This is like seeing a child who has just left the swaddling clothes grab the mourning clothes of his mother on the corpse bed and shout "I want to eat sweet milk." Our tears of sympathy are shed less for the dead and more for the living. The monk with eight fingers chanted a poem about children: "They only smile when scolded, and do not get angry even when beaten." The poor people at present are like being scolded and beaten innocently: adults know the pain of being scolded and beaten, and can still groan, shout, struggle, and resist; children do not know anything at all, only understand how to laugh, and never get angry. Isn't this the most tragic state in the world?</p>
<p>Compared with the various current situations mentioned above, the game of poor children discovered by our anonymous correspondent is still considered happy. Although they are not blessed to go to school, fortunately they do not have to follow their mothers to collect coal cinders, and they do not have to follow their grandfathers to catch dog excrement, and they still have leisure to play. Although they do not enjoy the seesaw specially made for children in the sports field, fortunately there are still these two benches, which are unconditionally used as materials for their sports equipment.</p>
<p>I'm just afraid that as the days go by, their grandparents will soon take these two benches to exchange for rice, and take these two children to collect coal cinders and catch dog excrement. By that time, what my anonymous correspondent discovered and what I painted will become a dream of the golden age of these two poor children. July 14, 23rd year</p>
<h3>Accounting</h3>
<p>— Mo Zhen</p>
<p>When it comes to the Qing Dynasty's scholarship, some scholars are always elated, saying that its development was unprecedented. The evidence is indeed sufficient: the great works of interpreting the classics emerge one after another, and philology is also very progressive; although there are no more historical theorists, there are not a few historical researchers: especially the study of textual research, which makes us understand the ancient books that the people of the Song and Ming dynasties never understood...</p>
<p>But speaking of it, I feel a little hesitant, fearing that the heroes may therefore designate me as a Jew, but in fact, it is not. Whenever I meet scholars who talk about the Qing Dynasty's scholarship, I can't help but think at the same time: "Ten Days of Yangzhou", "Three Massacres of Jiading" these little things, it's better not to mention them, but losing the national land, and everyone thoroughly being slaves for two hundred and fifty years, but in exchange for these few pages of glorious academic history, is this deal a profit or a loss?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am not a mathematician either, and I have not been able to figure it out. But I intuitively feel that this is probably a loss, much more of a loss than using the Boxer Indemnity to cultivate a few limited scholars.</p>
<p>But I'm afraid this is just a vulgar view. Scholars' views are detached from gains and losses. Although detached from gains and losses, the distinction between the magnitude of interests and harms does not seem to be entirely absent. Nothing is greater than respecting Confucius, and nothing is more important than worshiping Confucianism, so as long as we respect Confucius and worship Confucianism, we may as well bow to any new dynasty. The argument to the new dynasty is called "conquering the hearts of the Chinese nation in return."</p>
<p>And some hearts of this Chinese nation have indeed been thoroughly conquered, and even now, they are still using military disasters, plagues, floods, droughts, and locusts to exchange for the rebuilding of Confucius temples, the reconstruction of Leifeng Pagoda, the taboo of men and women traveling together, and the issuance of rare copies of the Siku Quanshu these major facades.</p>
<p>I also do not know that disasters are only temporary, and if there is no record, everyone will not mention them next year, but glorious undertakings are permanent. However, I don't know why, although I am not a Jew, I always like to talk about gains and losses, and I want everyone to calculate this bill that no one has ever mentioned. - And now is exactly the time.</p>
<h3>Summer Travel (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Maybe it's because it's summer, but on the beach, it's easy to recall the South, those colonial countries I've been to before.</p>
<p>Although I haven't seen the shade of coconut and mango trees here, looking at the elegant Western-style hotels and the white people sipping coffee on the lawn in front of the shops, it's as if I've returned to the seaside park of Singapore and the Green Lake of Yangon.</p>
<p>An unhappy feeling arises in my heart: Is our country as the same as Burma and Java?</p>
<p>However, in reality, if I wipe the sweat on my forehead at this time and take a walk by the Green Lake or sit idly in the seaside park, I believe it must be more pleasant. Because, at least, I won't see the broken walls and a mess of tiles among the green shade and grass. When will those traces of past wars be the most pleasant summer travel?</p>
<p>I think: it should be when everyone can take a summer trip</p>
<h3>On the Loss of Ambition Through Indulgence</h3>
<p>— Dun Pang</p>
<p>One of the Anecdotes of the Literary World in the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Gu Tinglin once encouraged his nephew, Xu Lizhai, the State Chancellor, saying, "Only with a mind to govern the state and survey its territories can one ascend mountains and observe waters; only with plans to relieve the world and pacify the people can one study the past and discuss the present."</p>
<p>According to Lin Yutang, "I have often said that 'losing ambition through indulgence' is a saying that pseudo-moralists of today have inherited from genuine moralists of the past. Nowadays, people say that visiting famous mountains, reading ancient books, and writing short essays are ways to lose ambition. However, Germans enjoy climbing famous mountains, the French love reading ancient books, and the British are skilled at short essays, yet the ambitions of these three nations have not been lost. They are not brave in private fights but timid in public anger, unlike our compatriots. Thus, it can be seen that the ambitions of our countrymen are inherently weak; losing them is not a pity, and even if they are not lost, they cannot achieve much." (See *Ren Jian Shi*, No. 7) Based on this, is Gu Tinglin a member of the "pseudo-moralists of today" or the "genuine moralists of the past"? However, he at least has a book called *Record of the Advantages and Disadvantages of Prefectures and Kingdoms*. Not to mention that he once led troops. It is certainly believable that Germans climb famous mountains, the French read ancient books, and the British are skilled at short essays, but whether they treat these things as "serious business" and do them every day is unknown. As for "our compatriots," their ambitions are inherently weak, and "even if they are not lost, they cannot achieve much," so it may be best to find ways to lose them completely, for losing them is not a pity."</p>

<h3>I Come From the East (5)</h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>If you take a look at a few streets in the south of Chicago, you will be surprised that the world's third-largest city can be so broken and dilapidated. In some areas where Italians live together, men, women, and children are crammed into small, dirty houses, living an inhuman life. Assassination and licentiousness have become habits there. There, there is no such thing as morality, righteousness, propriety, or a sense of shame. The wealthy class mostly live outside the city, and those who remain in the city at night, apart from small shopkeepers, are often the poor, beggars, hooligans, prostitutes, and immigrants from foreign countries.</p>
<p>Last year, because I couldn't stand the noise of Chicago, I specially escaped to Milwaukee to rest for a few days. Seeing Chicago again this time, I couldn't wait to get rid of it as soon as possible. While waiting for the train at the station, I read a newspaper. Fortunately, the train heading west had already stopped at the platform, so I hurriedly changed my ticket and left this cursed city to resume my westward journey.</p>
<p>Crossing the Rocky Mountains</p>
<p>The western United States, from a few hundred miles west of the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains near the Pacific coast, was originally a vast wilderness. Now, most of this area has been planted with wheat, but the western part is still a yellow desert, with red soil stretching for thousands of miles. The roads are covered with dust, and there is no running water by the roadside; only thorny shrubs grow, lying on the yellow wasteland, suffering from wind and sand. The population is sparse, and the towns that the car passes through often have only a few households. The houses are short, and even the few farmlands are the result of vigorous irrigation.</p>
<p>In this vast wilderness, you can imagine a picture of the early days of the American frontier. One or two hundred years ago, this was still a world ruled by red Indians. They rode tall horses, wearing hats made of raven feathers, draped behind their foreheads. Their waists were tightly bound with red belts, their legs straddling the horse's belly, running lightly and quickly like birds. When the cornfields were full in autumn, they would start wildfires, men and women dancing wildly around the raging fire. They wore deerskin shoes, and they worshiped totem poles carved with the shapes of birds and beasts. Their lives were cultivation, hunting, and war. Before the arrival of white people, the tribes of red people killed each other. They used the heads of those they killed to record their own glory. If too many heads were killed, they would use various methods to shrink the heads to the size of teacups. It is said that modern scientists have not been able to figure out how to shrink the heads in this way. Three or four hundred years ago, white people from Europe crossed the Atlantic Ocean and invaded from the east and south. In addition to dealing with wars between tribes, the red people also had to fight with white people. Their bravery and their skill in battle are praised by the United States; their chivalry and their generosity are also something that Americans today cannot match. However, in a short period of three or four hundred years, these original masters of the Americas have gradually become museum materials.</p>
<p>However, the red Indians' bravery in battle and their resistance and slaughter of white people indirectly gave the American nation a new force and a new spirit. As European nations expanded into North America, the resistance they encountered increased as they moved further west, and in order to overcome this resistance, the ability of white people in the Americas to conquer the environment also increased. When frontier pioneers like Boone rowed canoes made of tree trunks along the tributaries of the Mississippi River. The forests on both sides were eerie and poisonous, and Indian poisoned arrows and stones were fired at them from time to time. They struggled under heavy oppression. They had no so-called stable and enjoyable life throughout the year. In the huts made of rough wood, they had no stoves, let alone carpets. Women also had to learn to farm, and children also had to learn to shoot guns. They wore long beards and competed for survival with semi-civilized red Indians in semi-desert areas. Blood and death filled their daily lives, and horses and guns were the foundation of their lives. In order to eliminate barbarian races, they also acquired the brave and war-loving qualities of barbarians, and this temperament is a major condition for the real success of the American nation. In particular, the Americans in this area still maintain the habits and customs of the war era between the red and white races.</p>

<h3>The Significance of Standardizing Consultation Fees</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau had regulations on the maximum consultation fees for physicians several years ago, but the medical community opposed them because they did not conform to established principles. Later, I proposed to the Shanghai Medical Association to set its own minimum consultation fees for various surgical procedures in all departments to accommodate the general public. Over several years, incorporating the opinions of more than twenty experts, a standard was finally realized. However, some colleagues seem to still doubt its significance, so I will provide a simple explanation as an answer.</p>
<p>(1) For the average patient and their family, consultation fees are often mistaken for the price of life and health, so they tend to vary the amount depending on the outcome, and may even arbitrarily discount or refuse to pay altogether. If the physician presses for payment, it becomes a motive for false accusation. In recent years, lawsuits between doctors and patients invariably start with reluctance to pay the consultation fee, which is lamentable. This regulation clearly addresses this misunderstanding, making patients aware that paying the consultation fee is their responsibility, and the amount has a standard to follow. Will this resolve previous misunderstandings?</p>
<p>(2) For newly practicing colleagues! They often struggle to find a standard for the consultation fees of complicated surgeries and may feel that the fees are too high or too low. If this standard regulation is shown to them, they can use it as a reference. However, if the patient is truly poor, the fee can be lowered; if the surgery is truly difficult, the fee can be increased. By exercising discretion, they can avoid being excessive or insufficient.</p>
<p>(3) For quack doctors within the country, consultation fees are a remuneration for academic expertise and insurance for reputation. Medicine is a profound science, and one cannot enter the field without in-depth research. Therefore, its value must be high to compensate for the hard work during the years of study. As time passes and reputation grows, consultation fees must also increase accordingly, serving as insurance for reputation! Reputation cannot be obtained overnight, and there is a possibility of damaging one's reputation in every prescription and every surgery. Is it wise to exchange the reputation earned over the years for a small monetary reward? Now there are quack doctors who claim to solve the problems of the poor and sick, imitating business practices, greatly reducing their prices to attract customers. Because consultation fees have no standard, it is easy for them to perpetrate their deception. Now that a regulation has been established, their low prices will be limited, and the general public will not fall into their trap.</p>
<p>(4) For foreign quack doctors, while physicians have the freedom to set high consultation fees, foreign quack doctors take advantage of the Chinese people's admiration for foreigners. Their high consultation fees often exceed expectations because this is the only way to satisfy their ambition for economic aggression. The public, however, has always felt that consultation fees have no fixed standard, so even if they feel it is high, they can do nothing about it. If we show them the standards of this association, I know they will be shocked and retreat in dismay.</p>
<p>Appendix: Principles for Standard Consultation Fees</p>
<p>(1) All members of this association have the right to receive consultation fees.</p>
<p>(2) Members of this association shall not accept any unjust wealth outside of legitimate consultation fees.</p>
<p>(3) This association shall establish the following minimum rates for consultation fees as a standard, taking into account the current living standards in this city and the needs of the general public.</p>
<p>(4) Members of this association shall not set consultation fees below the prescribed minimum for unethical competition, but they may set consultation fees above the prescribed limit based on the complexity of the work.</p>
<p>(5) For physical or chemical examinations or the use of special instruments beyond the ordinary examination, additional fees shall be charged as appropriate.</p>
<p>(6) Consultation fees shall be higher than regular consultation fees, and fees for specialists shall be higher than fees for general practitioners.</p>
<p>(7) Members of this association may reduce consultation fees for indigent patients and provide free treatment for the very poor.</p>
<p>(8) Members shall provide free consultation services to colleagues, their spouses, and unmarried children. Nurses seeking consultation shall also receive free consultation services.</p>
<p>(9) Because conditions change constantly, "package deals" are prohibited.</p>
<p>(10) The medical profession is not comparable to commerce. Doctors and patients should not haggle over every penny. Consultation fees are different from wages. The patient's reward should not be contingent on the outcome. Consultation fees must be paid in cash or settled at the end of the month at the latest, and no compulsory deductions shall be made.</p>
<h3>Causes of Infertility</h3>
<p>— Wu Manqing</p>
<p>"Of the three unfilial acts, the greatest is to have no descendants." The Chinese people have always valued posterity. I can boldly say, "A large part of the tragedies in Chinese families are due to infertility." Because the general concept among us Chinese is that if a couple has been married for many years without children, it must be the wife who is unable to conceive. Therefore, "infertile women" are despised, bullied, and even unable to gain a foothold in the family. Alas! "Infertility"! You are a term that makes so many Chinese women sad!</p>
<p>We gynecologists encounter many pitiful women every day who come to inquire about the treatment of infertility. Of course, we examine and explain to them in detail. But I think there are many more unfortunate women bearing the infamous name of "infertility," so I wrote this article, "Causes of Infertility," to help everyone understand.</p>
<p>We must understand that "conception" is the union of sperm and egg, the combination of the reproductive seeds of both men and women. Therefore, if the reproductive ability of either man or woman is not healthy, conception cannot occur. When we encounter a couple who have been married for many years and still have no children, we must not blame one party. We must examine both bodies to obtain a proper answer. For example, if a man is born a eunuch, how can he ask his wife to bear children? Or, if a man has had purulent epididymitis, how can he blame his wife for not being able to conceive? Other conditions such as syphilis, diabetes, spinal cord injury, nephritis, or the consumption of large amounts of opium in men can all be causes of infertility. Regarding the causes of infertility in men, I will be brief here. I only want everyone to know that if a couple does not have children, it is not necessarily entirely the wife's responsibility.</p>
<p>As for women, the causes of infertility are also numerous. Some women are born without a vagina, or the vagina is blocked at one end. This certainly prevents conception (commonly known as "stone woman"). However, do not mistake women with thick hymens as infertile women. Because although women with thick hymens cannot have intercourse with men, sperm discharged outside the hymen can still penetrate into the uterus through very small channels and lead to conception. In some women, the cervix is naturally blocked, which of course also prevents conception. Some women have incomplete development of their reproductive organs, or they have suffered from endometritis, or the uterus is retroverted, or the fallopian tubes have been inflamed and blocked, or the ovaries have been inflamed, or they have suffered from local peritonitis. These can all be causes of infertility. In addition, conditions such as syphilis, diabetes, nephritis, obesity, endocrine disorders, and tuberculous salpingitis can all cause infertility.</p>
<p>The most pitiful is when women suffer from gonorrhea. Most women who suffer from gonorrhea are infected by their men. At first, she doesn't know. She just feels that there is more vaginal discharge. Later, the discharge gradually spreads upward, entering the uterine cavity, the fallopian tubes, and the abdominal cavity, thus causing endometritis, salpingitis, or local peritonitis. As a result, the fallopian tubes become attached due to the proliferation of connective tissue, becoming true blocked fallopian tubes that cause infertility. We know that other bacteria can also cause inflammation of the fallopian tubes and local inflammation of the peritoneum, but there is always hope for recovery. As for women who have suffered from gonorrheal tubal blockage, there is probably no hope of having children in this lifetime. Among these many infertile women, gonorrhea is the greatest cause. How pitiful this is!</p>
<p>As for the treatment of infertility, it must start from its causes. Because there are many causes, there is no fixed treatment method. Some require surgery, some require fallopian tube insufflation, some require medication, some require electricity, and some have no solution at all. Fortunately, finding a formal specialist physician can certainly obtain considerable treatment or explanation. As for things like "seed pills," I advise everyone not to be deceived.</p>
<h3>Should the Length of Study in Midwifery Schools Be Standardized?</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>About half a month ago, under the title "The Qualification Question in the Midwifery School Entrance Exam", I had published some opinions on the entrance qualifications prescribed by the Central Midwifery School. Because I felt that the authorities of the Central Midwifery School were too bureaucratic and unreasonable in restricting these entrance qualifications, I criticized a few sentences without being very polite. The general idea was this: The first point, the requirement for academic qualifications: must have graduated from high school or have studied in high school for more than two years; I said no need! Junior high school graduation is enough. The second point, the regulations on the age of the examinee: must be over twenty-two years old and under thirty years old; I said that this "over twenty-two years old" sentence made no sense. The third point, the requirement to be an "unmarried woman," I also thought that entering school to study midwifery was not the same as entering a monastery to receive vows. There was no need to only allow unmarried women to enter school, and it was unreasonable to restrict married women from taking the exam.</p>
<p>In recent days, I have seen a notice from the Ministry of Education regarding the length of study in midwifery schools in the education column of the newspaper. I can't find which newspaper or which date it was, I forgot; but the main idea is still very clear: (1) Junior high school graduates entering midwifery schools must study for three years, (2) Graduates of advanced elementary schools entering midwifery schools must study for five years.</p>
<p>Regarding these two points, junior high school graduation requires three years, and advanced elementary school graduation requires five years, I want to write a few opinions here.</p>
<p>There is still a point to clarify here: Why did I recite the previous opinions on the entrance qualifications of the Central Midwifery School at the beginning of this article? There is a reason: because this time the Ministry of Education's notice on the length of study in midwifery schools, and the entrance qualifications of the Central Midwifery School, seem to have an "air" of rising and falling together, with a taste of corresponding from beginning to end. This "rising and falling" and "corresponding from beginning to end" clue, if we spread them out to connect each other, will be very clear: The entrance qualifications of the Central Midwifery School require high school graduation or more than two years of study in high school, and the length of study is said to be two years; recently, the Ministry of Education has clearly stipulated the entrance qualifications and length of study for this midwifery school: junior high school graduates are set at three years, and high school graduates need five years. We don't know whether the entrance qualifications and length of study of the Central Midwifery School were called by the Ministry of Education before they were prescribed, just as we outsiders don't know whether the three-year and five-year length of study prescribed by the Ministry of Education this time came from the Ministry of Education's own idea, or whether someone else prescribed it for them; however, in fact, the Ministry of Education has probably tacitly approved the regulations on entrance qualifications and length of study, and there will be no disagreement. In this way, we understand very well: China's current midwifery education has formed a three-level system with three forms: a three-year school system that divides the length of study based on the entrance qualifications of</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Different, but determined the length of study three school systems. For example, the length of study at the Central Midwifery School is set at two years; why? Because its entrance qualification is "high school graduation." The Ministry of Education seems to have deduced it on its behalf: junior high school graduates need three years, and high school graduates need five years.</p>
<h3>Hygiene and Physical Examination of Children in Academic Teaching (Part 2) Cheng</h3>
<p>— Hanzhang</p>
<p>(B) Children Who Need Monitoring Should Continue to Monitor. Among those with physical abnormalities, those who need monitoring should continue to be identified. For these children, the key points and methods of their monitoring must be discussed with the school doctor, and the school doctor and teachers must work together to observe them. The types and severity of diseases that need to be monitored can be determined by the school doctor. But the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Those suffering from infectious diseases who attend school without proper preventive measures.</p>
<p>(b) Those with poor development, insufficient nutrition, and weak physique.</p>
<p>(c) Those with anemia, adenopathy, and beriberi.</p>
<p>(d) Those with abnormal vision, amblyopia, hearing impairment, otitis media, and throat problems.</p>
<p>(e) Those with nervous system abnormalities and mental weakness.</p>
<p>(f) Those with chronic bronchitis, asthma, pleurisy recovery period, heart weakness, and heart disease.</p>
<p>(g) Those with joint diseases, chest abnormalities, and severe spinal curvature.</p>
<p>(h) Those in the recovery period from nephritis and hernia.</p>
<p>(i) Those in the recovery period after ordinary illnesses.</p>
<p>(c) Nursing Care for Physically Weak Individuals. The children who need to be monitored mentioned above include those who are sick and weak, and those who are physically weak. They all need to be monitored continuously. For those who are physically weak, it is especially important to contact their families; schools must have hygienic nursing care facilities. These weak individuals should be distinguished from the sick and given full attention in daily hygiene education and physical exercise. Pay attention to reducing their burden and preventing them from becoming overworked. Also, take advantage of long vacations to allow them to hold vacation gatherings or set up a separate leisure class.</p>
<p>Children who are housed in such facilities are most suitable for those who are physically weak, undernourished, underdeveloped, have abnormal physiques and adenopathy, have respiratory and digestive diseases, have weak skin resistance, and are weak after illness.</p>
<p>(D) Treatment of Diseases and Defects. Children with infectious diseases should be treated according to the school's infectious disease regulations. For those with other diseases and defects, the methods of treatment or correction should be recommended to their parents or themselves. For those with visual and hearing impairments, pay attention to seating them in a seat that is conducive to learning in school every day. For postural abnormalities such as scoliosis, chest abnormalities, flat feet, genu varum, and genu valgum, efforts should be made to correct them. For chronic diseases of internal organs, the burden of some subjects should be reduced.</p>
<p>(E) Statistical Observation</p>
<p>The school should statistically classify the children's development, nutrition, types of diseases, and other necessary items, separating them by age and gender. This can provide a general understanding of the health status of the school's students. Also, classifying these statistics by year can observe the progress of school hygiene, which is very interesting. At the same time, using them to improve children's health is of great significance for the future of the country and the nation!</p>
<h3>Brief Introduction to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (10) (3)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>This type of dry cheesy substance, except for calcareous hardening as a good phenomenon, is mostly prone to softening over time. As a result, it becomes liquefied due to putrefaction, like porridge, or even milky white broken substances. In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, this substance is excreted to the outside along with sputum and saliva. As a result, the middle of the lesion becomes a cavity, the so-called cavity. In other organs, it can also form fistulas or ulcers. The size of this cavity is not uniform, the small ones are only like a pea, and the large ones can be the size of a fist. The inner wall of the cavity also secretes a large amount of pus, and this situation is very beneficial to the development of tuberculosis bacteria. Other microorganisms, such as streptococci and staphylococci, can also enter the lungs with inhalation; as a result, they can also occupy the cavity and collude with tuberculosis bacteria. This is the so-called mixed infection. It can increase the patient's fever.</p>
<p>When a tuberculous patient develops a cavity, his lesion is no longer surrounded by inflammatory and healthy tissues as before; his softened caseous substance can be excreted to the outside, and as a result, tubercle bacilli are also found in the sputum and saliva, and the patient's sputum and saliva are at risk of infection. At this time, in medicine, we give it a special term, called: "open tuberculosis". If the lesion is still surrounded by healthy tissue, tubercle bacilli cannot be detected in the sputum. We give it another name, called: "closed tuberculosis". The classification of these two terms is very clear in clinical practice: in fact, in the final analysis, it is entirely based on pathological anatomical changes. Readers, after reading the above description, will certainly understand.</p>
<h3>Common Sense on Hygiene for Ears, Nose, Throat, and Eyes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(7) Why Do People Catch Colds in Summer?</p>
<p>The cold discussed in this article refers to the common nasal cold (Schuupteu Coryza). In medicine, it is also called acute rhinitis (Rhinitis acnutla). It does not refer to influenza (lnflueuza Grippe), commonly known as a severe cold, which is transmitted by Pfeiffer's bacillus. This type of cold is less dangerous than influenza, and it is also less likely to develop into pneumonia. People who catch this type of cold generally do not need to resort to superstitious and foolish behaviors such as "selling a sure-cure for severe colds." Although I dare not say for certain whether it is an infectious disease, based on the fact that people successively fall ill in a group, I must admit that it has infectious properties. Although several types of bacteria have the ability to cause the disease, it has not yet been determined which one it is. This type of cold occurs most frequently in spring, autumn, and winter, like influenza. However, it also occurs frequently in summer. Residents of bustling cities (like Shanghai) are more prone to catching it than residents in the countryside. Why is this? Let me explain it clearly.</p>
<p>Since this type of cold is called nasal catarrh and acute rhinitis in medicine, we naturally know that the affected area is the nasal mucosa. Anatomically, our nasal mucosa is divided into two parts. The larger part is called the respiratory region, and the smaller part is called the olfactory region. The olfactory mucosa is very thin and yellowish in color, containing olfactory cells. The respiratory mucosa is thicker and reddish in color, rich in mucous glands (secreting mucus) and stratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells. The mucosa of the inferior turbinate (each nasal cavity has three turbinates, namely superior, middle, and inferior; from the outside, only two turbinates are visible because the superior turbinate is located deep and high, making it difficult to see) and the middle turbinate is particularly loose and soft. This is because of the presence of cavernous veins, smooth muscle, elastic fibers, cavernous bodies, etc. Therefore, this part of the mucosa can undergo special reflex changes and fall into an inflammatory state when exposed to changes in temperature, mechanical irritation, chemical irritation, dust intrusion, spiritual influence, etc. The reason why it is easiest to catch a cold in summer is because of the excessive opportunities to encounter temperature changes. I will now provide several obvious facts to prove this.</p>
<p>1.  The climate in summer is generally hot during the day and cool at night. People who are accustomed to sleeping with windows and doors closed are tempted to open them wide for a moment of coolness and sleep comfortably, thus catching a cold from the cold air.</p>
<p>2.  Some fashionable and modern movie theaters install air conditioning pipes in the summer to please the audience. When entering the theater, it is suddenly cold; when leaving the theater, it is suddenly hot. This sudden change from cold to hot is an artificial exposure to cold. Audiences with weak constitutions and lack of resistance are most susceptible to catching colds. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>On Medicine</h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>The purpose of medicine, broadly speaking, is to ensure the health of the nation; narrowly speaking, it is to treat diseases. In reality, it is simply to extend human life through various methods. All living things desire to maintain their lives because without life, they are insensitive and unable to act. Doctors are the messengers who maintain human life. Therefore, the importance and nobility of their profession rank first among all occupations. In advanced countries, doctors are highly respected. Their words are regarded as golden rules, and people obey them without forgetting. Compared to our country, where doctors are grouped with witches and diviners, the difference is immeasurable. In autocratic times, when nobles fell ill, doctors were required to kneel before examining them. Young women in secluded chambers were not allowed to be seen by doctors, leading to diagnoses through a curtain. If the illness was fatal, regardless of who was at fault, the doctor would be severely punished. The contempt for the status of doctors was truly outrageous.</p>
<p>The reason for this contempt is that most people do not understand the true essence of medicine, and the wide variety of medical practitioners is also a contributing factor. The saying "If you can't succeed in studying, and you can't succeed in business, then study medicine" is common. While there are indeed scholars who are well-versed in Confucianism and possess unique insights into medicine, earning the respect of the world, they are rare. Since the founding of the Republic of China, with all things being renewed, the importance of medicine has gradually been understood by the people, and medical practitioners have gradually learned to respect themselves. Furthermore, new doctors are all graduates of schools. This cannot be said to be the dawn of the medical profession. However, due to the lack of universal education, the status of doctors has improved, but the majority of the people still lack medical knowledge. Recently, disputes between doctors and patients often arise due to incurable diseases, leading to protracted lawsuits in court. This is a manifestation of the people's lack of medical knowledge. For example, when someone is in the terminal stage of tuberculosis or when cancer has already progressed to cachexia, they seek treatment from a doctor. When medicine proves ineffective and recovery is impossible, they do not blame themselves for seeking treatment too late; instead, they blame the doctor for negligence. The doctor is innocent, yet suffers such undeserved injustice. What could be more unfair? Although modern medicine has made great strides, there are many diseases that not only cannot be cured fundamentally but also whose true causes are still under investigation. Therefore, if a patient unfortunately dies, the doctor can only do their best based on their abilities and medical ethics. They can never guarantee to revive the dead and restore flesh to bones. There is a saying that doctors cannot cure diseases; they can only prevent them within certain limits. Medications cannot cure diseases; they can only assist the natural healing power to eliminate the disease sooner. This saying truly understands the essence of medicine.</p>

<h3>Records of Fragrant Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>My... Those close relatives were all desperately poor. Readers may not believe it, but it is indeed true! Moreover, their poverty was caused by the Empress Dowager! I often suspected that she deliberately devised these special methods to tease them: because every so often, she would pick out a few things to send to her relatives, these things were often heavily decorated but impractical; moreover, each time they were always packed in extremely large boxes or chests, and sent out with great ceremony. When her relatives saw them, although they secretly lamented, they always had to accept them with joy on the surface, and also had to thank the Empress Dowager and express their gratitude. In fact, they felt as awkward as if they were seeing debt collectors. Because whenever the Empress Dowager or the Emperor bestowed something on their subjects, the subjects had to follow the rules and give tips to the eunuchs who carried or followed them; these tips were also fixed amounts, unlike ordinary gifts, where the amount of the tip was determined by the value of the gift. They were based on the eunuchs' ranks: each third- or fourth-class eunuch had to be given twenty taels of silver; those of lower rank got ten taels each; if there were three of each kind, it would cost no less than ninety taels, not to mention that whenever the Empress Dowager had something to give away, those idle eunuchs always liked to follow those who were actually assigned to deliver things, like a swarm of bees, so that they could also get tips; as for whether the recipients of the Empress Dowager's gifts could afford such huge tips, they did not care! It was just that the Empress Dowager kept giving irrelevant things to her relatives, because she gave them too diligently, so that her relatives spent all their money on those eunuchs: later, they even had no way to spend. That would not do, the eunuchs would not leave without getting their money! So they had to use a poor trick to resist, which was that whenever the eunuchs came with things, they would first have someone or some people serve tea and soup to entertain them, and those eunuchs would never shout to leave, but would sit down happily and chat about everything under the sun, because they had long understood the reason for this.

<h3>The Doctorates I've Seen</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Although my hometown has been ravaged by soldiers and bandits for seven or eight years in a row, its culture has not declined due to the economic downturn; setting aside those who can get a bachelor's degree at home in two or three years, there are even doctorates who have eaten foreign bread and married foreign grandmothers, which cannot but be considered an honor!</p>
<p>Doctorates, of course, are "a dime a dozen" in Shanghai, but in my small hometown, the appearance of such a "foreign top scholar" must still be regarded with special respect; therefore, when the doctorate returned from France to Shanghai, our first meeting left a deep impression on my mind; in fact, his short stature, hunchback, glasses, and safety razor were good signs that made it easy for me to recognize him.</p>
<p>Naturally, success or failure is not enough to judge a hero. The doctorate's previous spirit of striving for progress, such as pawning off his parents' and wife's sustenance and running to Lyon to work as a student worker wiping floors and fanning stoves for others, is already rare; after returning to China for two years, he has not been given a satisfactory lucrative job, letting him spend these long years of poverty. Sometimes, "begging for a little blood" from others is indeed not to be blamed, although he is a doctor of law and understands the law of "obtaining property by fraud." As for "chasing wild pheasants" in amusement parks and taking girls to two-cent cinemas, that is the extreme boredom of a "hero" with no way to make a living. What is so strange?</p>
<p>"Graduation means unemployment," and the supply of doctorates also tends to exceed demand; thinking of the old and young in the doctorate's family who scrimped and saved to send him to school and are now starving, and the doctorate's own hard life as a student worker and his current poverty-stricken state, and the tragedy of his foreign wife abandoning him and returning to France, I cannot help but feel sorry for the doctorate and sigh for the doctorate's family. The doctorates I have seen are like this. I wonder if there is another one like him?</p>
<h3>The Peddlers I've Seen</h3>
<p>— Ji Chengxing</p>
<p>Among the many peddlers, the one who caught my attention the most was that old man.</p>
<p>One summer evening last year, Mr. Wang and I, classmates, were enjoying the cool air on Bolan Bridge when we happened to meet a peddler. We talked about the old man's family's economic situation from the perspective of business. At first, he was reluctant to talk, but eventually, our conversation showed extreme understanding for people living in the lower classes of society, and obviously, his heart was touched by our sincere attitude!</p>
<p>I stopped waving my paper fan and listened quietly to his words: "Sir, we have been doing this business for more than twenty years. Recently, business has become more and more sluggish. The daily savings are minimal. Sometimes we even lose money. My home is near Qingbo Gate: I have two sons. The older one went to Nanyang ten years ago, and we haven't heard from him since. I myself wanted to save some money to prepare to send my younger son to school. Unfortunately, things turned out unexpectedly. My older son suddenly came back last month. He had completely forgotten the situation at home. He didn't even remember my name. Is he my son? I couldn't help but be surprised. His accent, his speech, his appearance, ah, ah, they have all changed! Fortunately, I remembered that he had a mole on his right eye. Really, there was no mistake at all. He was wearing good leather shoes, a suit, and a beautiful straw hat... He was preparing to go to Nanyang again to do business. Now he was borrowing thirty yuan from me as capital. He said that he would get rich soon, and then he would tell me to enjoy the fruits of his labor. I was angry and annoyed when I heard his words. After being away for more than ten years, not only did he not bring a penny home, ah! However, I had to endure the pain and hand over all the money that I had painstakingly saved up on weekdays. Alas, what about my younger son's tuition fees? What about my own pension? Everything has been taken away by him, taken away!"</p>
<p>At this moment, his tears were about to jump out of his eyes! That load of golden melons was still begging for mercy from the passersby. I took out two dimes and threw them into his basket, and walked away without even looking back.</p>
<p>Now it is another sultry summer. However, among the peddlers on Bolan Bridge, the poor old man can no longer be found!</p>

<h3>Fourth Company Commander of Northeast China</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: The General Enjoys Himself with Wine, Women, and Song All Day Long; Few Warriors Return Amidst the Tears and Cries of Old and Young</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang laughed and said, "I think we should be content with being strong and not getting promoted to a particularly high rank. It's enough to be a regimental commander. Don't be some kind of commander-in-chief. I think if he does such a big job, he might marry three or four wives, and there will be endless domestic squabbles, which is also meaningless." Guizhi laughed and said, "I don't think he would cause such a commotion even if he became a high-ranking official. Just for coming back a little late, he would sing a song at home to appease his concubines. I think this concubine must be a beauty of unparalleled allure. Otherwise, this division commander wouldn't be so fond of her. If I have the chance, I want to take a look at her." Ms. Jiang said, "As the saying goes, three parts talent, seven parts makeup. How many beauties are naturally good-looking? It's just that they are well-dressed and well-accessorized." Although Guizhi felt that what her mother said made some sense, she still had this thought in her heart. Since the division commander loved her so much, there must be a reason. When she had this idea in her mind, she couldn't help but look at that foreign-style building whenever she went in and out. People were either laughing and giggling in that building or singing Peking opera. It was never quiet, and it was really cheerful. That night, in the brightly lit windows of that building, there was the tinkling of a piano, and a sharp female voice was singing in there. She thought to herself, "This must be the concubine singing. She sings like a lark, so it's no wonder the division commander loves her." However, this only intensified Guizhi's desire to see this concubine. The news spread through Mr. Zhao, and the people in the grain store in the front shop also knew it completely. The next day, Guizhi was dressing up to go to the obstetrics and gynecology hospital to examine her body, according to her father-in-law's instructions. A young apprentice from the grain store in front ran in like a flash and shouted, "Mrs. Zhao, come out and see! The concubine of that Division Commander Quan is about to come out! Her car is parked outside the gate." Guizhi couldn't escape that childishness after all and hurriedly walked out. Ms. Jiang was behind her, only telling her to watch her step and not fall. (439)</p>
<h3>The Soft-Shelled Turtle Treasure I Saw: Wang Shouqiu</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>It was probably last month? A strange thing happened in Qingjiangpu. A small person was found in the belly of a giant soft-shelled turtle. The facts are like this: There is a restaurant in Shili Changjie, north of the He River in Qingjiangpu. One day last month, because they wanted to make a dish, they bought a giant soft-shelled turtle weighing about four pounds. Who knew that when they cut it open, they found a small person about an inch long inside, with a mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. It was exactly like a person, but because it had been boiled first, this little person was already dead! According to some people, this little person is called Turtle Treasure, which is the essence of the turtle. If it is placed in the human body, all kinds of treasures underground can be seen completely. However, it lives on blood, so you must negotiate with it and only allow it to eat a certain amount of blood every day. Otherwise, it will definitely make you emaciated and die! This kind of bizarre story is of course unbelievable. I remember that there were records of turtle treasures in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio and Notes from the Thatched Hall of Wei, and I thought at the time that it was just a lack of words in the legend. I never knew that it actually happened. The things in the world are really incredible!</p>
<p>Turtles have turtle treasures; dogs have dog treasures; cattle have cattle treasures; horses have horse treasures; their values are all very expensive, especially turtle treasures, which are simply priceless treasures. However, the most intelligent of all things, humans, have never been heard of having human treasures. If humans were to have human treasures, their value would definitely exceed that of dogs, cattle, horses, etc., and they could make a foreign business deal! But humans have never had treasures appear, and I have to say that humans are not as good as turtles, nor are they as good as cattle, dogs, and horses! Alas!</p>

<h3>Book Collectors of Old Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>The current Shanghai is the cultural center of the country. Publishers are gathered here, and there are more collectors than those who crossed the river. Ancient Shanghai had no connection with publishers, but its book collectors were not far behind Lin'an and Gusu at that time. This may be a reference for local libraries, so let's talk about the book collectors of old Shanghai.</p>
<p>The first verifiable Shanghai book collector should be Zhuang Su. He was a person from the late Song Dynasty and once worked as a small scribe in the Secretariat. The Secretariat at that time was the National Kyoto Library, and the small scribe was the curator. Due to this position, we can determine that his nature was to love books. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, he abandoned his official position and lived in seclusion in Qinglong Town. (Its location is in the 45th Bao of Xinjiang Township, west of the county seat and south of the Wusong River. In the Ming Dynasty, its land was划归 Qingpu County.) He collected as many as 80,000 volumes of books in his private collection, which was really amazing. Tao Zongyi's Records of Halting the Plow said: "Among the book collectors in Jiangnan, there are only three with many books, and Zhuang is one of them." It can also be seen from this that Zhuang's collection of books was famous at that time. During the Zhizheng period of the Yuan Dynasty, the government specially sent scholar Wei Su to his home to collect books in order to compile the Histories of the Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties. Who knew that his descendants were useless and afraid that the government was coming to confiscate books, so they set a fire, and the terrible 80,000 volumes of books were all taken away by Liu Jia.</p>
<p>Du Yuanfang, courtesy name Yuquan, was a ninth-generation descendant of Duke Qi of the Song Dynasty. His era was slightly later than that of Zhuang Su. He once served as the registrar of Deqing County. In his old age, he retired to Ducun (southwest of Qinglong Town, on the bank of the Baihe River), built the Emerald Biyun Tower, and stored 10,000 volumes of books.</p>
<p>By the Ming Dynasty, there were even more book collectors in Shanghai. We will now only mention a few who have had an important relationship with the academic community.</p>
<p>Isn't Tao Zongyi's Shuo Fu a very great collection of ancient anecdotal books? Most of the small pieces of parts collected in it cannot be found elsewhere now. The initial publication of this Shuo Fu was due to the efforts of Yu Wenbo. Yu was a native of Shanghai and had the Wan Juan Lou (Ten Thousand Volume Tower) at home, with a rich collection of books. He spent a lot of energy to collate it, and even at the age of seventy-nine, he still did not give up the use of red ink. But from the side, we can know that he naturally had a rich collection of books to be able to collate the voluminous Shuo Fu.</p>
<p>Yu Wenbo wrote a poem entitled "White-Haired Old Scholars in the Forest," "The aged scholars in the woods with white hair collate Shuo Fu in the building all year round: their eyesight and thoughts are exhausted, but they do not know if it will benefit future generations?" See, isn't he very humorous!</p>
<p>Lu Shen was a famous official in the Ming Dynasty and had a very large and well-known collection of books. Therefore, we will not say much about him here, but about his friend Huang Biao. Huang Biao was not only able to borrow books, but also good at reading. He read through the classics and histories without regard to the cold and heat, and was familiar with the contents of various books. When Lu Shen had doubts about his writing, he always asked Huang Biao to collate it. Lu Shen's son, Lu Ji, once compiled Gu Jin Shuo Hai, a very famous collection of ancient novels, with a total of 142 volumes, and as many as 30 volumes were borrowed from Huang Biao as the base text. The Lu family's two generations of book collections should have been very impressive, but the rare and secret books still leaned towards Huang Biao. When Lu Ji compiled Shuo Hai, he also asked Huang Biao to be the chief proofreader.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of Huang Biao's collection of books are very sad! It was when the Japanese pirates invaded Shanghai that his books were all destroyed.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Wang Qi, the famous Mr. who compiled Continued Comprehensive Examination of Documents. After he was appointed as the Counselor of Shaanxi, he returned home and built a house on the bank of the Wusong River, planting a thousand plum trees, named "Meihua Yuan" (Plum Blossom Garden). He spent his old age there, enjoying writing books. His collection of books was very rich, and he was one of the four great masters of Song County during the Wanli period, along with Shi Dajing, Song Maozheng, and Yu Ruji.</p>
<p>The book collectors of the Qing Dynasty were even more numerous and great. The most famous ones were Li Yunjia, Mei Yizheng, Yu Songnian, and Xu Weiren. Now the length of the article does not allow me to say more, so let's change the topic next time.</p>

<h3>Drought and People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>— Duan Sheng</p>
<p>The high temperatures of this summer (during the plum rain season) persisted for about a month without sufficient rain to dispel the heatwave, resulting in a drought unprecedented in sixty years. At the same time, we see droughts and heat in North America (Canada and the United States), Central and Eastern Europe, and even England, where fish in the rivers are even dying from the heat. Furthermore, we see places like Moji, Shimonoseki, and Yawata in Japan described as "scorched hells," which shows the extraordinary intensity of the heat. One wouldn't expect this heatwave to engulf the land between the 30th and 55th degrees of northern latitude, but China is certainly not spared.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of disaster relief is how to obtain rainwater, or to ensure that dried-up rivers still have water. The next priority is to maintain and salvage the food crops affected by the disaster, and how to regulate the current food supply. Next comes disease prevention, fire prevention, and theft prevention. These are all matters that should be planned or handled during a major drought. However, although science has advanced to its modern state, seeking rain through scientific experiments can only be done occasionally. As for prayer, needless to say, it cannot have the power to reverse fate. Therefore, one can only find ways to channel water from places where it exists to places where it does not. However, this also requires preparation during normal times; if one is caught unprepared when the event occurs, it will be too late. Therefore, what should be discussed now is how to salvage the affected crops and food supply. Regarding the former, Mr. Gu Fu's article "Drought and Rice Cultivation" in this issue provides a detailed account of how to salvage and maintain the affected crops. This article will only add a brief discussion on the food supply aspect, merely to fill space.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the plum rain season, the weather has only been hot and dry. Transplanting rice seedlings was mistimed, and transplanted seedlings lacked water. The drought-stricken areas are also the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, which are known for their rice production. As a result, the situation has become serious, and people are panicking, giving grain merchants and hoarders an opportunity to exploit. Rice prices have soared. In less than a month, the price has risen from seven or eight yuan per shi to over thirteen or fourteen yuan. How rampant this is!</p>
<p>We need to investigate the reasons for the price increase. According to people in the grain industry, it is of course due to the prolonged drought and lack of rain, which will cause a "major famine year," so grain prices must rise. This reason is very superficial. Even if there is a "major famine year," it is still in the future. The grain we are eating now is still from last year's harvest, and has nothing to do with the current "drought." How was last year's rice harvest? We can use the words and actions of rice merchants before this drought to prove that it was a bountiful harvest with surplus. That is why they repeatedly asked the government to allow exports, to tax the import of foreign rice, and to find ways to maintain rice prices. Even without the merchants' statements, an observation of the rice price statistics shows that although the decline in prices is not entirely due to bountiful harvests, it cannot escape the control of supply and demand. The following table is copied from the Shanghai Rice Price Statistics table in the Social and Economic Monthly, starting from the month when new grain was first available (assumed to be October) to April (issues after May have not yet been published). (Unit: silver yuan)</p>
<p>|         | Japonica Rice |           | Indica Rice |           |</p>
<p>| :-------- | :----------- | :-------- | :---------- | :-------- |</p>
<p>|         | Highest Price  | Lowest Price | Highest Price | Lowest Price |</p>
<p>| Oct, '33 | 9.75         | 8.80       | 7.70        | 7.05      |</p>
<p>| Nov, '33 | 8.60         | 7.90       | 7.30        | 6.45      |</p>
<p>| Dec, '33 | 8.30         | 7.80       | 7.10        | 6.42      |</p>
<p>| Jan, '34 | 8.22         | 7.99       | 7.10        | 6.90      |</p>
<p>| Feb, '34 | 8.21         | 8.08       | 7.10        | 6.90      |</p>
<p>| Mar, '34 | 8.00         | 7.75       | 6.90        | 6.70      |</p>
<p>| Apr, '34 | 8.10         | 7.80       | 6.95        | 6.75      |</p>
<p>With such low and stable rice prices, one can't say that it wasn't a bountiful harvest. Therefore, the recent rice price increase from mid-June onwards is entirely due to using the current drought as an opportunity for speculation. Because the rice in the hands of ordinary farmers can be said to be almost non-existent: if there is any, it is only in the hands of rich farmers and landlords in the countryside; most of it has already been sold to rice merchants, hoarders, and brokers. If the rice were in the hands of the farmers, even if the price of rice were to rise, the increase would be gradual, not sudden. But if it is in the hands of rice merchants and hoarders, the rising trend will be unstoppable. Precisely because farmers are scattered, hearing that rice prices are rising, they will certainly sell successively, which is more than enough to control the rising trend. Rice merchants and hoarders are united, able to use their concentrated power to stir up a rising trend in the market, so the more expensive it is, the more they buy; the more it rises, the less they are willing to sell. But if the tools and opportunities they rely on for manipulation are slightly weakened, their downward trend will also be strong. Looking at the rice market in Shanghai this time, when the drought had just begun and the rice price had just started to rise, the hoarders in this city were very active, and the rice merchants who had rice were unwilling to sell it easily, so the rice price followed step by step. When the government announced that it would set a price limit, knowing that high profits could not be obtained quickly, the hoarders' intention to hoard slightly relaxed, and the rice price suddenly showed signs of softening. In addition, reports of ordering foreign rice caused prices to fall, and seeing rain caused them to decrease slightly. All of this is enough to show that this price increase is entirely the result of people's actions and speculative behavior, not a genuine relationship between supply and demand. As for the price increase during the lean season, it is the same every year, but last autumn was not a year of great shortage, so even if this year's rice price were to be slightly higher, it would not be as huge as it is now. Furthermore, looking at the rice price during last year's lean season, the increase was also very limited. So, was last autumn's harvest much worse than the year before? I don't think so. The following table shows the rice price statistics for last year's lean season (based on Social and Economic Monthly statistics):</p>
<p>|         | Japonica Rice |           | Indica Rice |           |</p>
<p>| :-------- | :----------- | :-------- | :---------- | :-------- |</p>
<p>| Month/Year | Highest Price  | Lowest Price | Highest Price | Lowest Price |</p>
<p>| May, '34 | 8.80         | 8.05       | 7.88        | 7.25      |</p>
<p>| June, '34 | 8.50         | 7.90       | 7.40        | 7.00      |</p>
<p>| July, '34 | 9.55         | 8.00       | 7.80        | 7.00      |</p>
<p>| Aug, '34 | 8.93         | 8.45       | 7.70        | 7.05      |</p>
<p>| Sept, '34 | 8.77         | 8.40       | 7.40        | 7.00      |</p>
<p>From the table above, the closer the rice price is to the time when new grain is available, the lower the price, which can prove the good autumn harvest last year. Therefore, the current surge in rice prices is even more a result of manipulation.</p>
<p>Since the rice price in Shanghai rose, the wind has spread, and the response has been immediate. Those who have rice are harboring thoughts of hoarding for profit, and rice prices in various places have risen accordingly; those who transport rice are waiting and watching, and the supply to Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce. Thus, the rising rice prices in Shanghai, the sales area, and the producing areas in the interior are mutually causing each other. Those who have money see the possibility of rice prices rising and also want to get involved, leading to today's situation. Rice merchants and hoarders can further purchase foreign rice and are also campaigning for tax exemption on imported foreign rice.</p>
<p>Is there currently a need for a large amount of foreign rice to be supplied? Aside from those who sell foreign rice, no one dares to answer this question affirmatively. In fact, there is no way to answer it. Because our country has always lacked surveys and statistics on the food supply. In the past, local officials still reported on the autumn harvest periodically, but even this formality is now gone. Therefore, it is impossible to calculate whether there is a surplus or a deficit. Even a good harvest or a bad harvest is just a comparative speculation. Even in years that are said to be bountiful harvests, rural farmers still often have nothing to eat but porridge and cannot afford to cook rice. However, this is not a problem of food supply, but a problem of farmers' poverty. Even with rice in front of them, they cannot afford to buy it. However, from historical observations, the coastal provinces have sometimes relied on foreign rice for relief in years of severe disasters. (See Feng Lutang's "History of People's Food Policy in China's Past Dynasties," Chapter 27) Since the founding of the Republic of China, the amount of foreign rice imported has been increasing year by year. After the rice shortage in the Jiangnan region in 1928 and 1929, foreign rice actually occupied the top spot among imports. Since the autumn harvest of 1930 was declared bountiful, the last few years have also been called autumn harvests, but the import of foreign rice is still considerable. Most of this is for sales in the Guangdong region. However, native rice has already suffered greatly from foreign rice! When new grain is plentiful, the market is often filled with a large amount of foreign rice, making it even more difficult for rice prices to rise; or when prices are slightly better, foreign rice takes the opportunity to enter. Native rice is suppressed by foreign rice, and farmers suffer a great loss. It was not until this year that the imposition of import duties slightly hit foreign rice. If this year's autumn harvest is slightly bountiful, farmers can catch their breath, and the countryside can be expected to gradually recover. Unexpectedly, due to the drought and heat, rice prices have been manipulated by rice merchants and hoarders, rising wildly and uncontrollably. The rice in the hands of farmers has already been sold off due to the continuous decline in agricultural product prices and the rural economy reaching a dead end. Although it is not to the extent of "selling new silk in February and selling new millet in May," it has already been sold, mostly in the hands of wealthy merchants and landlords. Therefore, the current rise in rice prices is the benefit of hoarders, not the benefit of farmers. Now, farmers have to buy rice from the market to eat, so they are eager to welcome the order of foreign rice to stabilize rice prices, and there is no reason to doubt it.</p>
<p>However, if this year's rice crop can be harvested, it must be discounted, and the cost will increase due to water lifting. If a large amount of foreign rice is imported, it may even cause the new rice market to be suppressed, and the farmers' economy will inevitably become more unsustainable. Therefore, I absolutely agree with the principle of ordering foreign rice to supply the people's food. What I want to discuss is the issue of the quantity of foreign rice. Merchants are ordering foreign rice for their own business calculations, so there is nothing to say about whether or not they should. Government agencies suddenly wanting to order a large amount of foreign rice to maintain the people's food supply is commendable. But there are two points to consider: First, how much rice is currently in stock? This can only be done by the government using its power to conduct on-site surveys and statistics in major rice production and sales areas to determine whether the existing grain can last until the new harvest. If it is insufficient, then how much foreign rice should be purchased? This is in terms of the current food supply for the people. As for the future, it will be after the damage in the disaster area is clearer. In drought years, it often happens that in the same area, the fields in one plot have water to irrigate and can have a full harvest of ten percent; the fields in another plot have no water to irrigate and may have no harvest at all. Therefore, the harvest in drought years is difficult to standardize. There are both good and bad harvests, hence the term "famine and harvest year." Furthermore, the most vulnerable to drought are of course high-lying fields or places lacking rivers. As for places that have always been known for their rice production, their terrain must be low-lying, irrigation must be convenient, and the water towns and marshes are the most suitable places for rice to ripen. Therefore, they are easily destroyed by floods, but difficult to destroy by droughts. Droughts only cost more manpower and water, while floods are a vast expanse of water, with nothing left. As the saying goes: "A drought is a line, a flood is a large area:" This shows the difference in damage to rice fields caused by floods and droughts. Some people think that surveying grain reserves involves government documents going back and forth, turning seven times and eight times. If there is a real shortage of grain, after the grain reserves are clearly surveyed, and then foreign rice is ordered, won't the common people have already eaten expensive rice? However, from various observations, as far as the current situation is concerned, it seems that the existing rice is not so difficult to supply for immediate consumption. The most obvious example is the Shanghai rice merchants' campaign for tax exemption on foreign rice. Didn't the Shanghai rice merchants recently want to order 500,000 shi of foreign rice and send representatives to Beijing to petition the government for exemption from import duties? Their reason is of course to regulate the people's food supply and stabilize rice prices, as if they are entirely considering the interests of us who eat rice. In fact, there may still be a little something hidden inside. The reason they are ordering foreign rice is that the price of foreign rice is cheaper than the current price of rice in Shanghai (reported by people in the rice industry to be around ten yuan). If they sell it, they will definitely profit. But thinking back to the current rice price, is it a natural trend or a man-made situation? People in the rice industry certainly see it more deeply than we do, looking ahead and behind, with some risk. Therefore, they want a safe way to guarantee that ordering foreign rice will not be a loss-making risk. So they thought of exempting foreign rice from import duties. Because foreign rice at ten yuan per shi in Shanghai would only cost about seven yuan per shi if import duties were exempted. At the current rice price, the profit is high. Even if the rice price falls back a little, it is currently the seasonal period of rising rice prices, and it will definitely not fall below the cost. Therefore, if the tax exemption is achieved, the rice merchants can be sure of making a profit. But then, why are rice merchants still worried about losing money when ordering foreign rice? Precisely because rice merchants also do not believe that the existing rice cannot last until the new harvest, and it is difficult to predict what the autumn harvest will be like. Also, as reported in today's (21st) Shen Bao business news, you can already see the rice merchants' hesitation about ordering foreign rice.</p>
<p>"......Foreign rice orders are continuing to be negotiated by telegram. No less than hundreds of thousands of bags have been telegraphed, but the production price has already risen. Yesterday's telegram showed another increase of four or five corners. This telegram was sent two or three days ago, so it will be difficult to reach a deal. If a high price is agreed upon, a loss can be expected, because the current Shanghai market has already fallen, and the cost is nearly one yuan higher. If the market price falls again, the twist will be even greater. Only some rice merchants hope that the authorities will exempt them from import duties, so that they can cooperate and send representatives to Beijing to petition. However, even if the tax exemption becomes a reality, the Shanghai price must fall again. The production price is too high, and the difference between high and low will be difficult to calculate......"</p>
<p>What the rice merchants are worried about is that if they order a large amount of foreign rice and the hoarders release their stocks; the drought may get rain, and later the weather will be sunny and rainy; or other crops will be replanted, so there will not be much of a loss; won't the rice price continue to fall? Therefore, they are asking for tax exemption, which will ensure that the foreign rice they order will not suffer the anticipated losses. This shows that the existing rice is not very scarce.</p>
<p>Tax exemption on foreign rice, for the benefit of consumers, the name is not just correct. But how real benefits extend to consumers is a big question. Rice prices are controlled by market transactions. If native rice rises, foreign rice will also inevitably rise with it. The rice is in the hands of rice merchants, and it is really difficult to make them sell the tax-exempt rice at a low price in fact, if there is no management organization in normal times. As a result, after the tax exemption, the rice merchants are only insured against losses when the rice price falls, and they increase their profits when the rice price rises. They will not sell tax-exempt foreign rice at a price lower than the general rice market. If there is really a need for tax exemption on imported foreign rice in the future, other measures should be taken to ensure that the benefits of tax exemption directly reach consumers and are not encroached upon by intermediaries in order to achieve the real purpose of tax exemption.</p>
<p>Although the words are like this; now is the time when the old and new are not connected, even without other contributing factors, the rice price will still rise, let alone this year there is a drought? And many fields in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have "missed the plum rain season and cannot plant fields." Even if the surviving rice can reach the new grain market, it will still take time, and it is not known whether there will be twists and turns in the autumn wind and autumn rain. Therefore, there are many opportunities for rice prices to rise. The people's food supply has not yet escaped the serious period, and how to adjust it later is naturally an urgent matter. Therefore, whether to order a large amount of foreign rice must be deeply considered by the government.</p>
<p>The authorities have not yet formally expressed their adjustment measures for the people's food supply in the future. It is expected that it will be after today's (21st) temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan. What can be discussed is only the stopgap measures for disaster relief reported on the 19th. Briefly stated:</p>
<p>"The initial focus is on the impact of food, strictly prohibiting the use of food for brewing alcohol and the export of food. If necessary, stipulate food prices and restrict price increases......"</p>
<p>Let's study this a little further.</p>
<p>(1) Prohibition of using food for brewing alcohol: This is a kind of relief method in ancient times when there was a food shortage. Its starting point is that alcohol can be avoided, and the amount of food consumed in making alcohol is very large, so prohibiting brewing is to maintain the people's food supply. But there are a few things to consider.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of brewing alcohol from rice, one is glutinous rice and the other is non-glutinous rice. The general rice that is cooked and eaten is non-glutinous rice, not glutinous rice. Therefore, the market prices of the two are not entirely the same. During the winter season when alcohol and cakes are made, the price of glutinous rice is often higher than that of non-glutinous rice; after this, it gradually decreases. If this year is like this, the price of glutinous rice is relatively low, so it has the reputation of being mixed into non-glutinous rice and sold. The bulk of glutinous rice goes to making alcohol, and the rest is only used for making powder cakes. Although it is said that in years of famine, grass roots and tree bark are used to fill the stomach. Non-glutinous and glutinous rice are both rice, so why abandon one? Not to mention that the amount of glutinous rice produced is not large, and the food uses are different. Prohibiting brewing does not help the people's food supply.</p>
<p>(2) Currently, rice wine has gradually been defeated by foreign wine. If brewing is prohibited again, it is tantamount to promoting foreign goods and defeating domestic products, which those who take it upon themselves to promote domestic goods would not want to do.</p>
<p>(3) If the prohibition of brewing is strictly enforced, it will inevitably disturb the people. If it is carried out as a story, then what is the point of the prohibition? There have been many disturbances in ancient times due to the prohibition of brewing. Therefore, even though the Qing Dynasty sometimes issued orders prohibiting brewing, it was no longer common, probably because they also knew that it was meaningless. I still remember that during the Three Kingdoms period, there was a famine in Shu, and brewing was prohibited, and even brewing equipment was prohibited. Many people violated the order, and it was considered a burden. No one dared to stop it. Then, Fa Zheng served the late Lord standing on the stage. Seeing a man passing by, Zheng immediately pointed at the man from afar and said that he had committed adultery. The late Lord was surprised. Fa Zheng said that the man had an instrument of adultery on his body. The late Lord realized and abolished the prohibition of brewing. (How the original text is and whether there are any errors in the names of the people cited, because there is no "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" at my desk, so I cannot check. But the fact is so. Author's note)</p>
<p>(4) Most of the rice wine is produced in Shaoxing, and many places also make their own, relying on it for a living. Once alcohol is prohibited, there will be a large number of unemployed people and closed shops. How can this be the way to protect industry and commerce?</p>
<p>(5) Alcohol is a necessary food item, not like opium and morphine. After brewing is prohibited, people's daily life will be greatly inconvenienced.</p>
<p>Therefore, making the prohibition of brewing alcohol the first problem in relieving the people's food supply is more than enough to disturb the people and not enough to accomplish anything. I don't think there is a possibility of it being realized.</p>
<p>(2) Prohibition of food exports: This so-called export is presumably referring to exports to foreign countries and does not include food transported from one port to another within the country. Originally, our country's food supply was not enough to supply others, so how could we allow it to be exported to foreign countries? If there is any, it is the authorities' failure to inspect, resulting in today's re-emergence of the proposal to prohibit food exports. If not, then there is even less to talk about prohibiting exports.</p>
<p>(3) Stipulating food prices: If it is the daily food price, it is jointly assessed by the official authorities or the rice merchants, and it is changed according to the market conditions without restriction. Even with the power of the official authorities, hoarders will restrain themselves. But if there are no restrictions, sellers can still hoard, rice merchants can still manipulate, and prices can still rise. Therefore, doing so is just putting the merchant's asking price under the supervision of the official authorities, which is a public evaluation. If you want to prevent the rice price from rising too much, there must be a limit. Then, this so-called regulation of prices is presumably not such a statement, but that the official authorities stipulate a maximum price and order compliance. Any violation is not allowed; this is the so-called price limit. Price limits have been implemented in Shanghai many times, and initially suffered various sabotages and obstacles, but later achieved considerable results. (See "Social Administration of People's Food in Shanghai Food Problem") Those who criticize it think that in famine years, there were orders that those who had rice could increase the price and sell it, the so-called "high prices can bring in distant goods." Let the merchants hear the news and come, and the grain ships will gather, and the rice price can be stable on its own. Why limit the price, which instead makes them look and be afraid, stop and hesitate, resulting in a lack of sources and harming the people's food supply. This statement is also very reasonable. However, the law is not immutable, and the positive and negative can be mutually reinforcing. The key is how to use it! The effect of price limits is that when the food shortage is gradually forming, there is rice but not much, and the rice price is already high, which is the time when hoarders are hoarding and rice merchants are manipulating. It is effective to implement it. If the savings are exhausted, how can price limits be effective? Therefore, price limits are used to stop hoarding; to let them know that the rice price has reached its peak and there is no hope of rising again. When hoarders see that there is no hope, they will definitely sell continuously. The only thing to consider is that after price limits are set, the following situations often occur:</p>
<p>(1) What to do if hoarders are unwilling to sell?</p>
<p>(2) What to do if vendors are unwilling to go to market?</p>
<p>(3) What to do if there is an underground market for price increases?</p>
<p>(4) What to do if inferior goods are used as superior goods?</p>
<p>(5) What to do if they collude with each other to coerce?</p>
<p>(6) What to do if the source of rice is cut off?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is also necessary to study the stipulation of prices. Currently, price limits are often based on the established situation, thinking that the market price is already high, and stipulate that they should sell at this price and not increase it. If the current rice price is sold at thirteen yuan, according to the historical rice price, it is considered high, and it is stipulated as thirteen yuan. When the rice price cannot actually maintain its price limit due to underground price increases, it is then relaxed by one or two yuan. This method is prone to abuses. How price limits are done will make people lucky, and the abuse of underground price increases will be even more profound. If it is limited and no longer relaxed, when the price limit cannot be maintained in practice, will it turn a deaf ear and destroy its prestige; or stubbornly insist on the price limit, regardless of everything? These are not proper methods. Therefore, it is believed that if food prices are rising steadily and there are real hoarding practices that can harm the people's food supply, and the government has to intervene, the initial step is to open the market together, so that those who manipulate and hoard will hear it and avoid it. If it still cannot be controlled, a price limit is issued. The stipulation of the price is at least between two kinds of prices: (1) the cost of the existing rice, and (2) the current market price. (1): Cost calculation is quite difficult. Usually, for hoarders who have registered, it is not difficult to calculate according to their entry cost plus interest and miscellaneous expenses. When calculating the cost at the time of the price limit, it is impossible to do it this way. A hypothetical entry cost should be sought first. It is difficult to assume this entry cost. Because the time when each person buys in is different, and the prices are also high and low. How to be more fair can only use the method of averaging. Roughly, the period of rising rice prices is after May, and the peak season for new rice is between October and November. That is, the price within a period from the start of the new rice to the seasonal increase roughly from December of the previous year to May of the following year, because rice is all within these six months should be used to calculate an average price, and it is tentatively assumed to be the purchase price of the hoarding (represented by A), plus the cost of rice loss during the storage period (represented by B), and combined, it is the entry cost of hoarding rice. In addition, add interest (C), warehouse rent (D), miscellaneous fees (E), etc. during this period, and the sum is the assumed cost of hoarding rice. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Cost = (A + B) + C + D + E</p>
<p>Adding the profit that the hoarder hopes for can be regarded as the price that should be sold on the market. Comparing it with the current market price and stipulating an appropriate price, this may be easier to convince the merchants and bring the rice price into the right track.</p>
<p>The above are all inadequate to solve the people's food problem. To solve the people's food problem, the fundamental plan is still to be self-sufficient in food. Food self-sufficiency is not a difficult task in our country. If there is a certain policy, a practical plan, without lofty slogans, without exaggeration, it will definitely be effective within a few years. However, according to the current situation, even without droughts and disasters, the food supply is still insufficient. Not to mention there are disasters every year. It is still necessary to treat the symptoms before being able to treat the root cause. The main points of treating the symptoms are: (1) Circulating domestic grain production: The circulation of domestic grain production cannot become a condition, but under the current situation, it is actually an important issue. Due to the lack of transportation facilities and the high cost of transportation, grain production and sales are not very convenient. Often, there is red-rotted millet in one place and famine in another. Therefore, circulating domestic grain production to help those who have a surplus and make up for those who have a deficit, so that both producers and sellers can benefit, is the current important plan. In the past, the Eight Provinces Food Conference had the establishment of a Food Transportation and Sales Bureau. Although it has not yet been completed, it is expected that it will eventually be realized soon. Its mission is very important. On the one hand, it wants to rely on the power of the transportation and sales bureau so that the grain production of each province will not be devalued due to the inconvenience of transportation and sales, and the rural economy will recover and prosper. On the other hand, it wants to regulate the surplus and deficit of domestic food and incorporate the meaning of a constant price into it. It combines storage and sales into one, and its work is difficult. On the one hand, the business should not be for profit, but it has its advantages and disadvantages of profit and loss, so its management is also very difficult. In addition, the lack of control over domestic production and consumption and the droughts and disasters every year are all difficulties for this business.</p>
<p>(2) Control the import of food: Taxing the import of food is not enough to do all the control. The reason why we purchase food from foreign countries is to benefit our people's food supply and not to oppress our agricultural production. However, the results have always been that it helps our people's food supply, and a large amount of our money goes away. Sometimes foreign merchants sell their surplus and dump it on our market, and the price of our agricultural products is depressed. Merchants do not understand the market sales and do not care about domestic production. Seeing that the rice price is rising, they compete to order foreign rice and fall into excess without realizing it. When the market price falls, they lose their family property and cannot regret it. The fault is due to their own actions, but the domestic agricultural products have been filled with foreign grain and cannot get a good price, and they suffer greatly. This is all due to too much indulgence in imported food. To remedy the situation, it is necessary to implement an import licensing system. First, the government should entrust the local governments where foreign food is imported the most. Anyone who wants to order foreign rice must register with the official authorities and obtain a license, otherwise the customs will not allow it to be imported. The government will then announce the types of foreign rice ordered, the amount sold, and the amount not yet received on a monthly basis, so that merchants can know what to choose. The central government will collect reports from various places and investigate domestic grain production. If it is deemed necessary to limit it, it may reduce or stop issuing purchase licenses so that it will not harm our grain production and still benefit the regulation.</p>
<p>(3) Food management measures: When there is a food panic, to suppress speculation in food, stabilize grain prices, or even seek the distribution of food and requisition of hoarding, there is no clear legal text, and enforcement is difficult. Good merchants and wealthy families can then secretly wreak havoc; clever officials and cunning clerks can take advantage of it for profit. Since the government has the determination to maintain the people's food supply and the path of stipulating food prices and restricting price increases when it is unavoidable, then at what point can the official authorities stipulate food prices, what to do with those who set prices and damage them; how to remedy the implementation with obstacles, and how to prevent the unscrupulous merchants who harm the people's food supply from being spared punishment; and how to prevent the responsible official authorities from abusing their power and destroying the grain industry: these all depend on the regulations of the law. It is known that the food management law is not easy to formulate. However, this is only for emergency handling of food shortages. Then, the highest competent official agency should formulate measures, announce them, and implement them so that officials and merchants know what to follow.</p>
<p>These three are only rough outlines. What we hope is that the government will determine the food policy, plan it carefully, prepare it step by step, and proceed in stages to solve the food problem, which is to realize the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Drought and Rice Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Gu Fu</p>
<p>Agriculture is the lifeblood of the nation, and the abundance or scarcity of harvests often depends on the weather. Those who manage agriculture generally anticipate the weather and decide on methods of cultivation. For example, in central China, the plum rain season occurs in June and July, so rice cultivation is suitable, as transplanting seedlings requires sufficient moisture. However, this year is abnormal; as of July 19th, the plum rain has not arrived. In the rice fields of Jiangnan, except for areas near rivers where machines are used for irrigation and transplanting has already been done, half of the mountain and plain fields have not been able to transplant seedlings. Moreover, the seedlings have withered, and even with heavy rain, it will be difficult to recover. Even those that have been transplanted are experiencing slow growth due to the depletion of river water and intense evaporation, making the harvest uncertain. With the declining rural economy facing another year of drought, how can one imagine the lives of farmers? People in society are all concerned about this issue. As someone who studies agriculture, I am even more concerned. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinions for reference.</p>
<p>The plum rain is a rainy season in China's climate, but it is limited to the central and southern regions, especially the Yangtze River basin in central China. The period is in mid-to-late June, the air pressure is very low, and there are often northeasterly winds. It rains continuously for days. The amount of rainfall varies from year to year, but humid and damp weather is the norm. The rainfall area is often very large. By early July, the weather is clear and refreshing, turning into sudden showers, accompanied by thunder and lightning, and the rainfall area is very small, with a clear distinction between them. However, the plum rain often undergoes variations. For example, in 1931, from mid-April to early August, it was almost entirely the plum rain season, and the rainfall in one day in late July was equal to the rainfall for the entire season this year. (The rainfall on July 24, 1931, was 133 millimeters; the total rainfall from April to June 1934 was 140 millimeters.) In 1932 and 1933, the plum rain arrived earlier, the duration was shorter, and the rainfall was sparse. This year (1934), since spring, there has been little rainfall. Let's compare it with the drought years of the past sixty years.</p>
<p>Month April May June July Total (mm)</p>
<p>Guangxu 14 58.5 55.8 85.6 94.7 294.6</p>
<p>Guangxu 18 98.7 160.4 65.8 7.2 332.1</p>
<p>Guangxu 24 134.9 159.0 54.4 26.8 375.1</p>
<p>Republic 23 65.0 44.3 30.8 27.1 167.3 (up to the 19th)</p>
<p>The data for the previous three years are based on reports from the Xujiahui Observatory; the data for this year are based on observations from the Wuxi Education Institute Meteorological Observatory. Therefore, although the rainfall in June and July of Guangxu 14, 18, and 24 was not high, there was still considerable rainfall in April and May. However, this year, since spring, there has been a drought, making it one of the driest years in the past sixty years. Furthermore, comparing it with the average rainfall in Xi'an, Shaanxi, it is even more obvious:</p>
<p>Month April May June July (up to the 19th)</p>
<p>Republic 22 Wuxi Rainfall 65.0 44.3 30.8 27.1</p>
<p>Xi'an Average Rainfall 33.6 50.3 47.2 91.3</p>
<p>Increase/Decrease Increase 31.4 Decrease 6.0 Decrease 16.4 Decrease 64.2</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the rainfall in Jiangnan this summer is even less than the rainfall in the Northwest. And since the Northwest has a dry farming system, it is clear that the commonly practiced farming methods in Jiangnan this year will not be applicable.</p>
<p>Drought relief measures are often different for regular and occasional occurrences. Regular measures, such as those in the northwestern provinces of China, include digging ditches to draw water from the Yellow River for irrigation, or digging wells in various places to utilize groundwater as a source of irrigation. Another measure is to study a farming method suitable for arid regions, such as selecting drought-resistant crops, breeding drought-resistant varieties, and implementing shallow plowing and mulching with straw to prevent evaporation. In the western United States, where rainfall is also low, there is a dry farming system. For rice cultivation, in high-lying mountain fields in places like Nanjing and Zhenjiang, there is a system of dry seedling beds to cultivate drought-resistant rice seedlings. In Korea, the plum rain often arrives late, in mid-to-late July, so there is drought-resistant dry rice. (When sowing, it is sown in dry fields without irrigation, just like dry rice. Ridges are built around it. After rainfall, the water is stored, turning it into paddy rice.) There is also a method of transplanting twice. (If it does not rain when the seedlings reach the appropriate stage and there is insufficient moisture, they are first transplanted at a narrower distance in a corner of the rice field to conserve water and maintain the life of the rice seedlings. After the plum rain comes and there is sufficient moisture, they are transplanted into the rice field.) Because the climate in each region has a certain pattern, agriculture has a certain method that adapts to it. However, the drought this year is only once in several decades, and it is an occasional occurrence that cannot be embedded in a fixed model to prescribe a permanent farming method. We can only adapt to the situation and devise methods for relief based on local conditions. However, the key to relief is nothing more than using the most economical methods to utilize the moisture most needed for plant growth, starting from seeds, cultivation methods, irrigation, and water conservancy, to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Rice is divided into two major categories: dry rice and paddy rice. Paddy rice is more commonly cultivated. Cultivating paddy rice often requires soaking in water, but it is also very drought-resistant. For example, during the prolonged drought last summer, the rice leaves withered and curled, but after the autumn equinox, with just an inch or so of rain, they were able to continue growing and achieve a considerable harvest. But generally speaking, rice cultivation is significantly affected after experiencing a drought. The impact varies depending on the stage of rice development. In the seedling stage, even if there is a prolonged drought, the area is small, making irrigation easier; and there are methods such as dry seedling beds to cultivate drought-resistant seedlings, so the damage is minimal. During the transplanting season, if there is a drought, it will inevitably delay the transplanting period. Because the seedlings are densely planted, if the period is too long, there will be insufficient nutrients, and growth will stagnate. If the rice seedlings weaken and develop poorly, exceeding the appropriate transplanting stage, even if it rains and they are transplanted again, there will inevitably be a poor harvest. If the period is long, the rice seedlings will wither and cannot be used as seeds, as is the case this year. A drought after transplanting hinders the tillering of the rice, the stems and leaves are short, and there is even no tillering at all, reaching the heading stage with very little yield, as was the case in 1933. The results of my investigation on the rice stem length in Xigushan, Guanyuan Township, Wuxi, are shown below:</p>
<p>Transplanting Period (June 20th)</p>
<p>Date of Investigation Affected by Drought (No Water, Land Surface Cracked) Not Affected by Drought (Continuous Irrigation, Land Surface Moist)</p>
<p>July 2nd 8 inches 8.2 inches</p>
<p>July 29th 8.2 inches 1.6 feet</p>
<p>August 19th 1 foot 2 feet</p>
<p>For those affected by the drought, the tips of the leaves withered, the leaves were short and narrow, the tillering was sparse, and the growth was slow. Even after the rain in late August, the heading was delayed by more than ten days, and the heading was uneven, with a large difference.</p>
<p>If the rice is subjected to drought during the tillering stage, the damage is less severe. However, the leaves are already lush, and the evaporation rate increases accordingly, and the irrigation water is easily dried up, so more water is needed. If there is a drought during the panicle formation stage, the damage is greatest. At this time, if water is cut off, the panicles may not emerge and will be in a withered state, or the panicles will emerge but not bear fruit, greatly reducing the harvest. If the drought period is prolonged, spanning several stages of rice development, the damage will naturally be greater. Furthermore, there are diseases that accompany drought, such as rice blast, locusts, borers, and leafhoppers, which will cause even greater harm.</p>
<p>Different varieties of rice have different resistance to drought damage. Varieties with less tillering, long panicles, thick glumes, dark green leaves, and thick leaf flesh are more drought-resistant. Late rice has a long growing season and consumes a lot of water, so it is also prone to drought damage, making it advantageous to cultivate dry rice. In mountainous areas, where there is little rain in winter and spring, and the water stored in the ponds is not much, dry rice or dry-cultivated rice can also be cultivated if there is a fear of drought.</p>
<p>Regarding cultivation methods, the drought-resistant transplanting method is different from the ordinary method. First, use a hoe to open ditches, with the ditches facing east and west, the distance between the two ditches is about one foot, every three or four inches, plant four or five seedlings, with the roots facing north, cover both sides with soil, and compact it with your feet, which is also applicable to the transplanting method of ordinary dryland crops. Then irrigate, striving for economy. Usually, during land preparation, transplanting, and weeding, a large amount of water must be poured in, and it is usually immersed in water to a depth of two or three inches. Now, irrigate only to moisten the soil, the rice can still absorb water, but there is no waste of water. After irrigation, do not step into the field, the same as not stepping into the dry field after rain.</p>
<p>For those rice fields that have dried up due to drought, use a hoe to lightly shave the surface of the ground to prevent water from being drawn up by capillary action, resulting in evaporation, and also scatter straw stalks and weeds between the plants to reduce water loss. After this, irrigate only to moisten the soil. In this way, a small amount of water can meet the needs of a large area of rice fields.</p>
<p>Drought-stricken rice fields should be fertilized sufficiently. Because the nutrients are abundant, the growth of the rice after rain is easy to recover.</p>
<p>For the irrigation system in each village, the relevant villages should gather, elect representatives, and establish an irrigation committee. The irrigation committee has absolute power over the distribution and irrigation of water, and no one is allowed to open or close the water outlets freely. In this way, water can be distributed evenly and water disputes can be avoided. If the drought is too severe, in order to protect the majority of rice fields, it is even necessary to sacrifice a small part of the land. The sacrificed fields are still compensated for their losses by the neighboring fields, sharing the burden. In modern terms, this can be called irrigation control. If the amount of water is saved, more fields can be irrigated.</p>
<p>A more fundamental method is the management of water conservancy. Taking Jiangnan as an example, on the one hand, dredge the river channels connecting the lakes to allow the lake water to flow smoothly into the interior. On the other hand, rebuild the gates along the river to introduce river water and prevent the loss of river water. But this cannot be done without the government allocating huge sums of money. As for the shallow water areas inland, dams can be built at both ends, and machines can be used to pump water into the river to raise the water level, and then cattle carts, human carts, or water wheels can be used to scoop water into the fields, which farmers can also cooperate to do.</p>
<p>As for the mountainous areas, where it is not possible to transplant rice seedlings, it is also quite difficult to plant other crops. In early July, late soybeans, red beans, green beans, etc., can be sown, but now it feels like it is too late. Only buckwheat can be sown as late as mid-August, but whether it can withstand drought is still a question, and it is difficult to get a large amount of seeds for a while. Changing to planting cabbage and radishes is not feasible because the market is not wide and storage is difficult, so it is difficult to promote large-scale cultivation. In short, under these extraordinary circumstances, there is no brilliant agricultural method for drought relief, so we can only do our best to the best of our ability.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Market During Bank Holidays</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual for the day, so most of the market was at a standstill, with nothing to report. Although money shops were still open as usual, only a small part of the business was cleared between fellow businesses, not enough to be considered a transaction. In the market, the silver dollar discount was still 5 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets. The morning market turnover and new transactions were over 3.1 million, and the afternoon market was over 200,000. The small general meeting turnover was over 300,000, the silver dollar public order collection was over 28 million, remittances from various routes were over 300,000, and banknotes recovered were over 200,000. Jiangnan small silver dollars were still at 833.2 yuan in the morning market, the same as the previous day, with 3,000 jiao traded. Because there were no transactions in the afternoon market, the market price was the same and did not change. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 727 yuan in the morning market, and the afternoon market changed slightly, to 726.8 yuan, resulting in a better result than the previous day, up 8 jiao, with 60,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were at 333,000 wen, up 1,000 wen from the previous day, with a transaction price of 9,400 yuan in silver dollars, totaling 31,302 strings of wen.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Affected by political rumors = The bull camp was slightly shaken. The 96 bonds fell the most, by 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Last week, from July 16th to 21st, the trend of government bonds on the Chinese Securities Exchange was completely surrounded by political tides and rumors of the 96 bonds. Moreover, with the settlement period approaching, the barriers on both sides were getting higher and higher, and slight rumors easily caused shaking. However, observing the entire week, most of the sellers, except for the larger quantity from the Northern Gang, were mostly retail bulls coming out and swapping, and the short sellers were also quite active. The buyers, on the other hand, belonged mostly to the big players. Political rumors fluctuated from time to time, although they had nothing to do with the bonds themselves, they were easily exploited by speculators. The rumors of the 96 bonds became even more bizarre. At first, it was said that the reorganization was completely fictitious, then it was said that the customs surplus after 220 years would be used for the reorganization, and finally it was said that from the September futures, the Ministry of Finance would prohibit them from being listed for futures trading. Examining the reality, it was nothing more than baseless fabrication. The floating bulls were flustered and easily targeted, causing a huge wave in the market price. In fact, there was no definite news about the reorganization. As for the recent market trend, because there were only two days left for this month's futures trading, after many days of short covering, it may turn into a squeeze. Over the past week, the market price suddenly fell a few cents to more than one yuan on Monday due to the political tide, with big players buying and retail investors selling. On Tuesday, sellers were scarce, and the No. 4, 46, and 53 bonds continued to be bought, rebounding a few cents to one yuan, and the 96 bonds also rose by 57 cents. On Wednesday, the market rose a few cents to over one yuan. On Thursday, rumors gradually increased, and floating bulls came out, giving back half a yuan. The 96 bonds fell by 7 cents. On Friday, the rumors were even more prevalent, and the 96 bonds fell sharply by 1.3 yuan. On Saturday, the news was better, but the rumors of the 96 bonds were the most rampant, and a large number of floating bulls came out, with the opening price of the 96 bonds falling sharply by about 2 yuan, showing the emptiness of people's hearts and the crowd of rumors. After the first round, the rumors gradually subsided, and the floating bulls were disturbed by themselves, only to be exploited by the short sellers, showing that speculation can be done but cannot be overdone. As a result of the week's market price, it was down 12 cents to 89 cents, with only one or two slightly up 12 cents. The total turnover was 10,039,200 yuan.</p>

<p>American Cotton Futures Rise About Twenty Pounds</p>

<h3>Grain: Rice Market in Hexia Suddenly Turns Steady</h3>
<p>| Slight Drop of 2-3 Yuan |</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs were especially scarce, with only 11 ships (about 1,500-1,600 piculs). Due to the rain, there were very few customers, and transactions were limited (the market was very quiet). However, the rear customers' gangs suddenly had a Longkou gang move to handle two ships of Songjiang late rice, about 200 bags. As a result, although the market was soft, people's hearts were quite stable. As a result, the distributors once tightened the market, and the market situation stabilized. The prices of regular gangs such as Su Tong, Nan Gang, etc., as well as the late rice of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, etc., did not rise or fall. Dujian also stabilized, and Yangjian was not opened. The slight drop in Yinyuan was due to the slowing of its route, down 2-3 yuan.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 15-16 ships from Hexia, and due to the continuous rain, there were few customers in the market. High-quality white japonica and thin rice were stable, and mid-quality prices were down about 1 jiao. The remaining goods were stable.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Puyi Reading</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Since Japan seized the Northeast after the September 18th Incident, no matter how the international community "sympathized" with China, and despite our efforts to implement "non-recognition" at all costs, it has in fact become someone else's land. Originally, given this situation, the Commander of the Kwantung Army could have simply renamed himself the Emperor of "Manchukuo," but international circumstances forced him to take that into consideration, and for the same reason as our painful non-recognition, he cleverly concocted various tricks and forcefully established a "Manchukuo" against the will of the people, bringing Puyi, this precious object, to be a figurehead, a monkey in a hat and gown taking the stage.</p>
<p>Puyi is seen as a rare commodity by Japanese friends for two reasons: first, he can be installed as a head of state without real power, displayed at the world's royal exhibition, and gain a place among the nations; second, he still has some "legitimacy" in the hearts of the old people in the Northeast. Using Puyi, who ascended the throne twenty-five years ago in the imperial court, as emperor, to suit their desire for a "true son of heaven."</p>
<p>In fact, both of these can be said to have failed. This descendant of the Aisin Gioro clan cannot conceal Japan's purely colonial aggression in the Northeast. At the same time, it has failed to subdue the people of the Northeast in the slightest. The factual blood lessons have made them clearly recognize that the "royal way paradise" is the eighteenth level of hell. Therefore, the dream of "three-nation intervention to return Liaoning" for several years has not made Japan hang on in the slightest, just like the loyal ministers and righteous men on the big stage who say "recover lost territory," which Japanese friends see as just a lecture at a tea house. But the tens of thousands of volunteer soldiers, heroes who "sacrifice their families and go to the disaster," fought with the enemy in blood and flesh, making Japan unable to sleep peacefully, demonstrating the path of national struggle for freedom and liberation. Who says that China is currently powerless to resist the enemy and that only enduring humiliation is the truth of "patriotism"? In fact, in the Northeast under the suppression of hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops, the activities of the volunteer soldiers have been the biggest concern of the invaders for several years.</p>
<p>In order to completely conquer this new colony, Japan is carrying out methods that its guns cannot achieve: slave education that eliminates national consciousness. This policy, in addition to suppressing the cultural development of the majority of the people, anesthetizing and fooling the people, also cultivates a small number of running dogs loyal to "Japan-Manchukuo." The former is manifested in the closure of many rural primary schools, while the latter is evident in the establishment of countless Japanese language specialty schools, the selection of officially funded students to study in Japan, and even the so-called "girls' visiting groups" and "military pacification teams." The upcoming establishment of the Manchu-Mongolian aristocratic children's school, Weicheng School, and Puyi's taking on the position of principal of the school and attending Japanese classes for twelve hours per week, is also a funny drama played out under this policy. This is a telegram from Changchun, the capital of the Northeast, a few days ago: "The violent Japan is trying to fool the people of the Northeast, especially starting from the puppet ruling class. Therefore, the Japanese are instigating the puppet. Recently, they will establish a so-called Manchu-Mongolian aristocratic children's school, named Weicheng School. The principal will be Puyi himself... But in the future, he will also be a student of this fake school, that is, the rebel Puyi must attend classes for twelve hours a week at this fake school to study Japanese."</p>
<p>What does this event make us realize? Obviously, the so-called "aristocratic children" are the sons of those high-ranking officials, wealthy merchants, and gentry, who were all "people who did not dare to lag behind in patriotism." Therefore, after the Northeast has a fake country, a small number of these people become new nobles, and their children enter aristocratic schools! But another large part of the people are fighting for a broken country in the "green sand tent" in the snowy and icy world. This depicts who is a traitor and who is a patriot. "The merchant girl does not know the sorrow of a ruined nation, and across the river she still sings the Backyard Flower," we see the enjoyment of the playboys in the urban cities of Jiangnan, which makes people feel infinite sighs. I am afraid that those who hate the country are not only merchant girls, and their actions will not be limited to singing the Backyard Flower!</p>
<h3>Ascent to Heaven</h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>After several rains, it has indeed become cool. Opening the south window, reading under the lamp, there are no moths fluttering around, and I don’t have to sweat like rain. We should offer twelve thousand points of gratitude for the great achievements of the rain-praying rituals!</p>
<p>Gusts of wind blow in from the window, faintly accompanied by the sound of cicadas in the distance. I feel light and airy, as if slowly ascending. In front of me, a person wearing a Taoist robe and eight-trigram vest vaguely guides me. It feels like stepping on clouds, and I only hear the sound of wind whistling past my ears. I suspect I have entered a dream, and I ask the Taoist master leading me. He replies in a forceful tone: "Bookworm, have you read too much Dream of the Red Chamber? Where did this dream come from? You were reading by the window, and a red light pierced the clouds, revealing your deep roots. Therefore, I am guiding you on a trip to the Heavenly Palace."</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"As he speaks, he points ahead," That is already the South Heaven Gate."</p>
<p>I look as far as I can see, and indeed I see an incomparably tall paifang, with the three characters 'South Heaven Gate' written on it, shimmering with golden light. I ask the Taoist master his name and what important business he has in Heaven.</p>
<p>"This humble Taoist's surname is Zhang, respectfully called Master, residing on Dragon Tiger Mountain. Because of the prolonged drought and lack of rain, the fields are barren, and the subjects of the lower realm are fearful, so they built altars to pray for rain. This humble Taoist was meditating on a futon, and after divining with my fingers, I realized it was a heavenly calamity, impossible to reverse, because the world's morals are declining, and the Jade Emperor decreed a year of drought as a warning. Only virtuous officials and people are willing to atone for the common people, praying day and night. This humble Taoist has a virtue of loving life, so I am going to the upper palace."</p>
<p>As he finished speaking, we arrived at the South Heaven Gate. Wang Lingguan, holding a golden whip, blocked our path. Master Zhang whispered to him privately, and then he let me in. After a few steps, we encountered Erlang Shen Yang Jian, with his black dog, wandering on the left side of the road. The master whispered to him again, and then we escaped into the Heavenly Gate.</p>
<p>Halfway, Master Zhang said to me: "The Jade Palace is a forbidden area, and idlers are not allowed to enter. Violators will not be pardoned. Because I have a private relationship with Wang Lingguan and Erlang Shen, they let you take a tour. When I go to the palace to present my memorial, do not peek around, or you will lose your life!"</p>
<p>After speaking, the master strode forward. I looked east and west, secretly harboring trepidation, lest I be seen by the eunuchs and palace maids and questioned about my background. What would I do? So I walked along a winding path. There were all kinds of rare flowers and exotic plants planted there. I was like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, overjoyed beyond measure, and I unknowingly forgot the ban and walked forward at will. I saw a magnificent palace with thousands of stone steps, and guards on both sides, with knives drawn, exuding a formidable aura. Master Zhang was straightening his crown, waving his sleeves, holding his court tablet, and ascending the steps without looking sideways.</p>
<p>I thought, in a thousand years of life, it is rare to go to heaven, so I was not afraid of being sliced into ten thousand pieces. I detoured to the back of the palace, and fortunately it was quiet and empty. A corner of the back of the palace was damaged and not repaired, probably due to financial exhaustion. So I peeked through the gap.</p>
<p>I saw Master Zhang prostrating himself on the red steps, kowtowing three times and nine times, and then presenting his memorial. After a long while, there was no sound from inside the palace. The officials in the two rows stood like wooden chickens, and the master remained prostrate.</p>
<p>"Your memorial is approved!" Suddenly a voice startled my soul, but because of the palace corner, I could not see the person, which I still consider a regret.</p>
<p>After the speech, the officials in the two rows and Master Zhang all shouted "Long live" three times.</p>
<p>I then detoured back to the place where I parted with the master to wait, and indeed I saw the master coming happily. I pretended to ask: "Was the memorial approved?"</p>
<p>"Since we have offended Heaven's wrath, there was no way to reverse it. The Jade Emperor, feeling the sincerity of the virtuous officials and people of the lower realm who prayed for rain, and the merits of this humble Taoist's forceful pleading, ordered the Dragon King to immediately send down sweet rain to relieve the people's suffering." After speaking, he laughed loudly.</p>
<p>I looked up, and in an instant, black clouds spread everywhere. The master shook my hand and said: "The heavy rain is coming, hurry!"</p>
<p>Before reaching the South Heaven Gate, the rain poured down, and for a moment the people's voices were boiling, shouting: "Heavy rain is falling!"</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and looked around, and it was a dream. The south window was banging, and the books were all wet. It was raining heavily outside the window.</p>
<h3>Whose Merit Is It?</h3>
<p>— A Feng</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has suddenly become extremely dry and hot, the farmland has cracked, and signs of disaster have appeared. Therefore, the nine streams, three religions, and other virtuous people have all used their magic and set up altars to pray for rain. Indeed, the heavens are responsive, greatly moved, so the weather suddenly cooled, and heavy rains fell from time to time. Whose merit is this?</p>
<p>The Catholics say: "We held rain-seeking ceremonies, reverently praying for nine days. By the eighth day, there was drizzle in the city, and the heat was slightly reduced. Recently, there have been intermittent rains and sunny days, and we hope that there will be a great and timely rain soon. This is the merit of our Lord God."</p>
<p>The Taoists say: "The practice of praying for rain is recorded throughout history, but the Taoists are the most skilled in praying for blessings. Now, it happens that Zhang Ruiling, the 63rd generation Celestial Master of the Han Dynasty, is residing in Shanghai. We requested him to set up an altar and perform rituals, hoping for a great rain. The recent rain is the merit of Celestial Master Zhang."</p>
<p>The Buddhists say: "The Panchen Lama is our country's Living Buddha. He set up altars to pray for rain at Bao Hua Mountain, Qixia Mountain, and other places the other day. Naturally, our Buddha is spiritual, widely spreading the Dharma rain to save all sentient beings. This is the merit of our Buddha's great compassion."</p>
<p>The common villagers say: "The Dragon King of the East Sea is quite efficacious. In the past few days, we have welcomed the gods and held temple fairs, bringing out grass dragons, bull monsters, snake gods, and everything else. Therefore, the Dragon King exhaled clouds and spat rain. This is the merit of our Sea Dragon King Bodhisattva."</p>
<p>Alas, whose merit is it indeed?</p>
<h3>Walking on the Road</h3>
<p>— Wen Li</p>
<p>Because the iron whip of life is beating on my back, I have to run on the road in the scorching heat. I live in an alley next to the road that is exposed to the sun all day long. As soon as I leave the door, the sky puts on a hazy, unclear face and stares at me. The sun's fiery hand immediately reaches out to my body, a feeling like an assault, it's hot. And I didn't buy a hat this year - no, I once bought a rattan-silk woven hat and wore it for a few days before selling it to a friend - my hair is black, and it feels the heat the fastest. When my skin starts to feel hot from the sun, my hair is already burning on top of my head like a ball of fire. It doesn't matter so much when my skin gets sunburnt, but when the heat starts from my hair, no, it should be said, descends, heating the top of my head, heating my skull, my nerves are attacked, besides a headache, I immediately feel dizzy. My feet are walking, but my head feels hot and painful, so I busy myself by raising my hand to cover my hair. This action is clearly a subconscious one, wanting to use my hand to resist the sun, just like heroes standing up to protect women in distress: but after my palm feels like it's being burned by the sun, I realize it's too hot, and I consciously realize that it's a stupid thing to do.</p>
<p>Walking and walking, my eyes don't dare to look at the sun above, but for the sake of walking safely, I have to look at the scenery in front of me. If I'm not careful, one or two cars might rush out from the turning point. Needless to say, I'll die under the wheels, and even the warning horn, sounding like a ghost's scream, is enough to make my heart beat uncontrollably. Looking at the scenery on the road, in the scorching heat, there's not a wisp of wind. Even if a gust blows in my face, it's a hot, spicy breath that not only oppresses you and makes you unable to breathe, but also forces its way into your nostrils, and your throat immediately feels dry and you start to choke. Looking at the scenery on the road, the shop banners hang in the air like mourning faces, motionless; when a car speeds past, a cloud of dust follows behind its rear end, rushing towards your eyes and feet. My God, the asphalt has melted! When your shoes walk over it, they squeak and cry; that asphalt must have reached its boiling point, it keeps melting, melting, and when your shoes walk over it, it's hard to pull them out. If you're wearing rubber-soled shoes, they're sure to melt together, and you'll feel like you're stuck in a swamp, suffering an indescribable danger. Fortunately, I'm wearing leather shoes, although they're clumsy Chinese-made leather shoes. Fortunately, when I walk over the asphalt, they don't melt together.</p>
<p>Walking on the road, the sun scorches the skin on your body with a fire attack, and damages the black hair on your head. In the scorching heat, I resent this society: why are some people able to sit in cars, while others have no choice but to run on foot? Walking on the road, this kind of restless thought makes me fall into a fantasy.</p>
<h3>Abnormal Psychology!</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhang</p>
<h3>Taking Shortcuts</h3>
<p>— Mu Yin</p>
<p>Taking shortcuts means being opportunistic, unwilling to expend considerable effort, yet able to reap highly rewarding results. Then, the famous saying that "one gets one's due for one's efforts" is simply equal to zero!</p>
<p>This habit has created a great force in the eyes of the Chinese people. Look, there is almost nothing in society, no one, who does not want to take shortcuts. Cunning intelligence is displayed everywhere, and others are used everywhere to achieve oneself; but sometimes one is unconsciously used by others. In doing things, one only asks about the effect, but is unwilling to do things step by step, with a firm foothold. Cunningness and deception are thus born! But, taking shortcuts is just taking shortcuts, without gray stones and iron tendons, how can a building be built! Take education for example. For more than thirty years, from the opening of various crash courses to the current adoption of new European and American school systems and new educational theories, such as the credit system, graduate schools, and even the Dalton Plan design method adopted by small schools; which one is not a shortcut, but what is the effect of implementation? Not even half a point has been received, it's just making a few big circles!</p>
<p>This is not to deny the fact that the latecomers surpass the old-timers. Can you say that Japan after the Restoration is not on par with Europe and the United States? However, learning head-on and taking shortcuts are distinctly separate facts. Learning head-on still requires twelve points of effort to do well. It's not like you can succeed just by learning, not to mention whether it's suitable or unsuitable for the existing environment. We have already taken the cleverness of learning head-on; and still want to take shortcuts, really want to build a building with matchsticks!</p>

<h3>Breaking Out of the Cage</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a twenty-year-old who has read a few years of books. I am now working hard in a certain factory, earning only four or five cents a day, which is exchanged for the exhaustion of my energy and blood, and I also have to endure the brutal abuse of those wolfish Japanese. But for the sake of life, I finally endure and silently allow them to do whatever they want. Alas! I have been under such oppressive work for two or three years. Recently, the factory has become different from before, and events such as reducing wages and increasing work are gradually happening. This behavior of the hard-working workers makes everyone suffer, but most workers still succumb to their money. There is nothing that can be done. (Of course, I am included) Now I often want to jump out of this cage-like Japanese factory and find another life, and I don't want to be humiliated by them anymore. I am determined to go to another place to become an apprentice, because I am nineteen years old, I am afraid that my age will be an obstacle, and I dare not jump out of the factory at will. I am very hesitant in my heart. Therefore, I would like to ask you, sir, for a good method: (1) Can I still become an apprentice at my age? (2) If I cannot become an apprentice, how can I avoid being oppressed by them? Please give me your wise words and find a way out for me. Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Your believer, Shi Wenyu, respectfully submits his reply: Your life is indeed extremely bitter, however, now, who among the general hard workers is not struggling under an unbearable painful life! Who is not tightly locked in a "cage"? We can no longer endure it, we urgently need to jump out of this "cage". But I cannot agree with the method you thought of to jump out of the "cage", because if you jump out of this "cage", I am afraid that you will inevitably enter another "cage". It is true that the factory has recently gradually reduced wages and increased work, etc., and your life is even more unbearable than before, but do you know that the recent strikes in a certain silk factory and a certain cigarette factory were also caused by "wage cuts", "increased work", and even layoffs? Crows are generally black all over the world. In the current society, the fate and life of workers are all the same miserable and bitter. All the differences are only more than fifty steps and a hundred steps. Even if you become an apprentice, your life may not necessarily improve, and it may even be more painful. The monthly income of an apprentice is generally around one or two yuan, and the work done is not necessarily easy. Brutal abuse is also unavoidable, and you may also have to endure some unwarranted personal insults from the boss. You cannot endure this hard-working behavior, you cannot succumb, and you want to seek a way out, which is naturally very appropriate, but to achieve the goal of liberation, it is not to quit in anger, to go home and eat old rice, nor is it to "look at that mountain while standing on this mountain", to go to another factory or another industry to do "hard work", but to face all the oppressions imposed on the "hard workers" and remove them as much as possible. As for how to remove the oppression? That is very simple, whoever gives you oppression, you shout out the slogan of liberation to him, to make him unable to oppress you again in the future, whoever is oppressed should put forward resistance. Only in this way can hard workers have the hope of liberation and a day when their lives can be improved. Still enduring in silence and allowing them to do whatever they want, or just wanting to passively avoid their oppressive path, then there will never be a day to turn over.</p>

<h3>Return (2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Bulgarian Ivan Vazov, translated by Yang Sen</p>
<p>"Goodbye, my child! Bless you!" the mother shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Stoyan!" the girl also shouted.</p>
<p>But their voices were drowned out by the noise. Stoyan was mixed in with the soldiers, and all the soldiers quickly disappeared into the fog.</p>
<p>The mother was still standing and looking, but she could no longer see anything.</p>
<p>The little daughter picked up the corner of her apron and covered her face.</p>
<p>Stoyan's mother returned to her home, opened an old box, took away the undershirts, and found a large candle at the bottom of the box. She lit it and placed it in front of the statue, and began to pray in a low voice...</p>
<p>At the same time, near Dragoman, the sound of guns and cannons was booming. That was on November 4, 1885.</p>
<p>That night, Mother Zunna had a dream.</p>
<p>She saw a large cloud, and a team was moving in the cloud, and Stoyan was among them. Holy Mother Mary! How frightening! The cloud was moving and thinning, the sky was trembling, and the earth was shaking, as if a war had broken out. Stoyan disappeared into the cloud, and then could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>At this time, Zunna woke up. All around her was darkness, a pitch-black night. Outside, the wind was howling fiercely. A war... My Lord God, Jesus Christ! Protect him· Holy Mother Mary· Grace Stoyan!······</p>
<p>She couldn't sleep until dawn.</p>
<p>"Father Peter, what does it mean to dream of a cloud?" she asked the next morning.</p>
<p>"Zunna, there are two kinds of clouds. One is a rain cloud, and the other is a steam cloud. Which one did you dream of?"</p>
<p>She described her dream, and Father Peter pondered.</p>
<p>In his book of dream interpretations, it seemed that he had never encountered such a cloud. But when he saw the woman's uneasy face, he said to her, "Don't be afraid, Zunna, your son is strong and happy. This cloud means news, you will soon receive a letter from Stoyan."</p>
<p>The mother's face immediately brightened.</p>

<h3>The Encounter of Dolores del Río</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Dolores del Río is a movie star who moved to Hollywood from Germany. Her works in the United States, such as "Ramona" and "Little Star Kidnapped", have already been released in this city. People who have seen her works have some image of her, and probably haven't forgotten her completely, right? Recently, I saw a very unfortunate piece of news about her in an American film magazine; I'm afraid I won't see her works again in the next few years, which is a pity!</p>
<p>We know that Jews have great power in the American film industry. If they united to oppose a week and no longer watched the films starring this star, this unfortunate star would have no hope of a film company signing a contract with her. Dolores del Río is this unfortunate star!</p>
<p>The matter is because a rumor arose in Hollywood that she was a member of the German National Socialist Party. The Jews hate the National Socialist Party the most, so the newspapers run by Jews across the United States requested Jews in the United States to boycott the films starring her, saying that she was taking American money to Germany to supply the National Socialist Party. At that time, theaters were showing her "Little Star Kidnapped", and they immediately removed her name from the advertisements. It just so happened that Paramount's contract with her expired at that time, and the company did not continue to sign a new contract: let's see how the wind blows first. Other companies certainly did not dare to hire a star who was being boycotted. So unless she could find work on the Broadway stage, she had to return to her hometown - Germany!</p>
<p>How did this rumor arise? Because someone said that her husband was the editor of an important organ newspaper of the Berlin National Socialist Party: although she and her husband denied it, people did not believe her words were true. She once said to an interviewer: "I have nothing to do with politics, and I don't even fully understand what politics is. I only have one interest, and that is doing my work in front of the camera. My husband writes novels for the newspaper and is also a critic. Although he has been working for the newspaper for five years, he is not the editor of the National Socialist Party's organ newspaper. He has nothing to do with the National Socialist Party's newspaper, unless you think that every German newspaper is a party newspaper."</p>
<p>Dolores del Río is now in a position where Paramount Company is powerless, and there will be a film company signing a contract with a star who is being boycotted: even she herself has nothing to think about. Although she is not a party member, she cannot declare her opposition to the National Socialist Party. Her hometown is Germany, she loves her hometown, and she will eventually return to her motherland in the future. Does she want to oppose the rulers of her motherland and become a homeless wanderer? But besides this statement against the National Socialist Party, what other methods can satisfy the American Jews?</p>
<p>So she can only quietly wait for this heinous rumor to destroy her.</p>
<p>(Chapter missing and fees due. Otherwise, please send a letter immediately to declare and resend the seal.)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Half a Sinner"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Half a Sinner | Cathay</p>
<p>This film adopts the ordinary lives of a group of hooligans and vagrants. Precisely because it depicts their ordinary lives, there are quite a few commendable aspects. The characters are all archetypes: a wandering pastor, homeless young men and women, boxers, and petty thieves. Their lives consist of drinking, gambling, fighting, scams, and deception. Only the young couple wants to live a good life, but society doesn't allow it, so they are imprisoned and arrested. Even though it's a misunderstanding, it ultimately becomes their ordinary life.</p>
<p>Among these people, the hypocritical pastor, whom the playwright uses as a source of humor, is naturally the most noteworthy. The playwright illustrates the pastor's extreme hypocrisy: he is very solemn and restrained in front of women, even placing God on his head to preach to them. However, his intention is to swindle them into gambling. Behind the backs of gentlemen and ladies, he drinks, gambles, and listens to jazz music. But when presenting a solemn appearance to the public, he pretends not to drink and listens to broadcasts of church hymns. In these instances, due to the director's skillful performance, the playwright's portrayal of the pastor's dual personality is truly satirical enough.</p>
<p>However, the playwright lacks the courage to directly declare war on religion. Although the hypocrisy and deceit of religion are fully demonstrated through this pastor, in the end, he doesn't dare to destroy the pastor. Ultimately, he rescues him, allowing him to win a lot of money from the rogues and rascals, returning the loan to the shopkeeper, and even finding a way to return the young couple's engagement ring. These parts are undoubtedly unrealistic, and the reason the playwright arranges it this way is to change the audience's negative feelings towards him, thus compromising with religion. This tendency is a common flaw among American film writers, and the inclusion of this unrealistic element in an originally realistic subject matter is a significant loss to the work.</p>
<p>Similar to the depiction of the pastor, the hotel landlady is also treated with a dual personality. She calls herself Mrs. So-and-so, and she pretends to be very amiable in front of guests. However, on the other hand, she displays her shrewishness everywhere, especially in front of the hypocritical pastor, where she drops playing cards from her purse to depict the positive and negative sides of her personality. This is truly satirical enough in a situation where both love to gamble but also want to save face for each other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the playwright has admirable successes with the other characters, fully demonstrating that the playwright possesses considerable cleverness, and his technical skill is also quite mature. However, these alone cannot conceal the emptiness of the content. Although the elements of satire and mockery are very amusing, the entire work fails to clearly point out their social basis and their inevitable future. He merely sketches and mocks these people with a humorous approach. Apart from the love story of the young couple, there is neither cruel hatred nor fervent sympathy for the rest of the characters. The attitude of a cynical and sarcastic bystander is the film's primary expression. Even though he mocks the pastor the most, he ultimately surrenders. Therefore, we cannot say that this work possesses any special significance.</p>
<p>Every scene demonstrates that the director is very dedicated, especially the scenes involving the pastor, boxing matches, and gambling events, which reveal ample life experience. However, his merit lies precisely here. Regardless of his relatively economical approach, in terms of montage, there are some places where time and space are not well and logically edited. Moreover, the success of the pastor is largely due to the actor's individual success, we believe. Breton Churchill's acting is truly very delicate. He not only expresses the dual personality of the character in his face and movements, but also pays close attention to the tone of his dialogue. The others are generally competent, but the female lead, Sallie Blaoe, is significantly inferior to her performance in Robert Z. Leonard's "The Demi-Bride," which is evidently due to the director's fault.</p>

<h3>Casanova the Second</h3>
<p>— Yunmen</p>
<p>Wasn't Casanova (Casanova) the greatest lover of all time? His entire life was devoted to chasing women. What the opposite sex craves belongs to that kind of bold and daring "hot" daddy (Hotpapa). Therefore, this Casanova was able to fulfill every desire. At the same time, stealing other people's wives and taking what others love inevitably comes at a price. So, secret rendezvous tonight, duels tomorrow morning, entering traps, or jumping into cages – his secret history of risking his life for beauty has become the bible of modern romance. But our big-nosed, nonsense-talking Bo Hu Qi Mei Dulun is very unconvinced. Can't a naturally large, unparalleled nose of mine attract the attention of the opposite sex? So, despite people laughing at him as a "fool," he still used all his romantic tricks to hunt for the "hot girl's" red, greasy cherry lips. Where there's a will, there's a way! No wonder he called himself Casanova the Second!</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, go watch "Fool Don't Fool Brain" which premiered in Nanjing yesterday. I guarantee it will tickle your fancy. Moreover, the "hot girl" is the irresistibly hot Lop Fan Li. Okay, everyone, please don't say anything wonderful just yet. (Thank you)</p>

<h3>Twentieth Century (4)</h3>
<p>— Wenyin</p>
<p>Lilian encountered a small setback on her trip from Poet's Valley to New York. A young, wealthy man named George Smith, who had spent a lot of money on Lilian in Poet's Valley, followed her to New York. Initially, Lilian found him interesting; he seemed considerate and attentive, a passionate young gentleman. But over time, he gradually tried to interfere with all of Lilian's actions. One day, in a drama magazine, he saw an article by a star-worshipper, saying that Lilian had many lovers, almost like having three thousand male concubines. The passionate young gentleman took it seriously and used the magazine to question Lilian, which gradually made her find him annoying. At this time, as George was digging deep and scrutinizing Lilian, someone suddenly knocked on the compartment door, which made Lilian happy. When the door opened, she saw O'Malley standing there, grinning at her. He impolitely shouted at her: "Hello, you little devil, little Benatt (famous European actress), how are you doing?" Lilian also laughed and said, "Hey, you high-handed rascal, who let you on this train?" O'Malley said, "Don't you know yet? We're making a big fuss about your business." Lilian suddenly shivered and quickly asked, "Who are 'you'?" O'Malley deliberately teased her and said, "Guess." Lilian already understood. She asked, "Is Oscar Jaffe on the train too? Tell me quickly?" She shouted loudly. O'Malley pointed outside and said, "Right next door. That Napoleon is back from Moscow again. His head is full of blood, but he hasn't lowered it at all." Hearing this, George Smith suddenly jumped up and said, "Oh, so it's Jaffe. No wonder you want me to get off the train!" Lilian glared at him fiercely and spat, "Nonsense! How would I know he's on the train? I should thank you for telling me." She then turned her head and angrily said to O'Malley, "I'm not going to see him. I'm free, and I'll never give up that freedom. Mr. Jaffe has looked down on me and mistreated me for three years. He said many nasty things about me... He calls himself my Svengali (the creator and husband of a famous actress in "Trilby"). Svengali! Fine, you go back and tell that shameless Svengali that even if he starves to death, I won't go to see him. I hope he does starve to death!" O'Malley said, "Lilian, how can you say that? Isn't he your creator?" Lilian screamed wildly, "What is he to me? Get out of here! ... Sadie!" She looked around for her maid. "Where did Sadie go?" George jumped up and said, "You don't need to look for Sadie. Leave this to me." He then said to O'Malley, "Get out!" He walked towards O'Malley aggressively. O'Malley could only shrug and retreat. Lilian then stood up and stretched out both arms. She knew that was the most effective method, gained from her years of experience on stage. She cried, "Why do they always treat me like this? What do they take me for? Made of iron? Just keep hitting me with a hammer... Wherever I go... they follow me!" She threw herself into George's arms, crying like a child. In fact, the same performance had moved the entire audience in the theater, making everyone shed tears for her. (To be continued)</p>
