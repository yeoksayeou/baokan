<p>時評</p>
<h3>公共租界工廠檢查問題廷</h3>
<p>一國工廠法的制定。直接在改良工人待遇。解决勞資糾紛。間接則在發展國民經濟。維持社會治安。其關係的重大。不問可知。但是有了工廠法而不知道其實行的程度和範圍。亦便等於没有一樣。所以各國在頒布工廠法之後。都跟着頒布工廠檢查法。用以考核前法的實施情形。我國的工廠檢查法。亦在工廠法頒布後而産生。主管機關實業部當局。採納了國際勞工局專家彭恩與安德生二人的建議。决定把工廠檢查一事。分期按步的逐漸發展起來。以實行督察工廠法全部的執行爲目的。本年四月初。實業部批准了中央工廠檢查處的實施程序。預備分五期推進。現據調查。國内已辦第一期檢查工作者。共有十四省市之多。惟有居全國工廠中心點的上海租界區域。對於該問題至今還没有滿意的解决。實在令人遺憾。最近發生了法租界太乙麥精粉廠汽鍋爆裂的慘劇。吳市最特地發表了談話。（深信凡關心本市工業發展同情勞工生活者。當無可否認工廠檢查爲本市亟待積極進行之要務。）於是本市居民對於租界工廠檢查問題。又在嚴密的注意了。　　據國際勞工局專員彭恩與安德生二人的報告。當他們在民國二十年間參觀上海各工廠，或與廠主團體及廠主私人接洽，或與工人團體領袖談話的時候。大家都告訴他們説。上海有立即舉行工廠檢查的必要。同年十一月。實業部次長。就延請上海市政府及兩租界工部局代表。作非正式的會議。以便商定一個檢查上海全市（包括兩租界在内）工廠的統一辦法。在當時的會議席上。各代表一致承認了兩個原則。　　（一）上海各工業區域。祇應有一種勞工法規。　　（二）此種法規之實施。應由檢查人員執行之。其行動須一律。不得彼此參差。　　開第二次非正式會議時。三方代表。對於下列三點又各同意。　　（一）上海公共租界及法租界當局。允任用中國政府所訓練並舉荐之工廠檢查員。以檢查各該界内所有之工廠。此項檢查員由中央檢查所之檢查員隨時督察之。　　（二）公共租界及法租界内之工廠檢查員。應將檢查之結果與困難。按期報告中國政府與公共租界及法租界當局。　　（三）上海市公共租界及法租界内之全體檢查員。應按月會議一次。以交換意見。並將所應補救之處。恊商辦法。　　如果租界當局肯按照上列原則和中央的實施程序。分期辦去。那末上海工廠檢查一事。本可順利進行。而在中國勞工史上放一異彩。不料公共租界的董事會。以爲過去一次的决議。未曾正式認可。寗願遠兜轉的一再去召集納税人特别大會。修改地産章程附則第三十四欵。以取得飭令工廠領照的必要權力。然後才凖備根據了這點的限制。在界内設立檢查機關。以便施行一律適用於中外工廠的工業法規。換句話説。董事會想以工部局的權力。而不以中國中央政府的權力。去主動執行界内的工廠檢查事務。至於納税人特别大會是否有權對於地産章程的附則作這樣的修改。是否將因此而損害中國現行法規的統一性。便不多理會了。　　去年五月起。上海市政府又和工部局再三交涉。雙方已大致商定組織聨合檢查所。可是仍不免於爭執。爭執的焦點則在於檢查員的管轄問題。原來工部局雖允諾任用中國政府所舉薦的工廠檢查員。而乃堅持着管轄檢查員之權。應整個操於局方之手。猶恐該局以外的官廳。得在界内行使職權。而影響其地位。市政府方面則主張雙方以同等人數組織委員會。由委員會員管轄檢查員之責。可是工部局對此點始終不肯同意。以致交涉無進行可能。現在我們依然希望工部局有改變態度之一日。因爲第一·在中國政府宣布施行工廠法之時。工部局曾發表正式宣言。在原則上表示贊成之意。該局過去的立塲。自然不能隨便放棄了。第二·工廠檢查。所以考核工廠法的實施。工部局亦已承認竭力在可能範圍内。將中國現行工廠檢查法的基本原則。在界内一律切實施行。這點由該局自動宣布。亦不至於遽然推翻。　　現在所爭者。旣然只在上文所指的管轄問題。我們要問這是不是值得爭的。或應該爭的。最不幸的是工部局居然認爲（此事有一種或恐無法解决之根本困難。即在中國方面主張主權。在本局方面欲保持在公共租界内所有行政權之完整。）（見該局一九三三年報告廿一頁）在這區區數十字内。顯出工部局很肯定的把中國看做對手方。好像牠是和中國毫無關係的一個主體。而完全忘却其爲由絶對多數的界内中國納税人所維持的一個市政行政機關。我們以納税人一份子的地位來説話。覺得這不是我們所希望於該局的態度。租界係中國的領土。當然爲該局所知道。不必再去説明。此外我們還記得。在一八六四年北京公使團會議上海市政時。其議决案的第二條。亦曾説。上海租界所得設立的任何領土權。（不得超越市政事件，道路，警察，及市租税之範圍以外。）其後工部局的章程。雖迭有更改。其所有的權限。無論如何。不能超越上述原則之外。實在毫無疑問。現在檢查工廠一事。明明有關於全國的勞工行政。决不能看做是任何市政機關可以主動創辨的事情。最低限度。工部局亦不應越俎代庖。取得中國政府檢查界内華人工廠的權力而有之。　　我們認爲工部局對於工廠檢查的管轄權。在事件的性質上和本身的權力上。固然是不應該爭的。而旣經承認了在可能範圍内。切實和中國當道合作。施行中國工廠檢查法的基本原則。而依然拘泥於什麽管轄權的得失。使合作一事。成爲廢話。實在不免於舍本逐末。所以亦是不值得爭的。美陸軍航空隊</p>

<h3>蘇聨農民征服旱魃（莫斯科通訉）引沅</h3>
<p>今年上季、蘇聨農業史上最有意義的一個紀事、就是那集體農莊的農民、制勝了幾乎蹂躪遍北半球的苦旱、　　當美國農莊臨着近四十年來最惡的歉收、正傾其國家預算案以辦理防止飢荒聨盟賑濟時、當加拿大正遭遇百年來未有的苦旱而無法救濟時、當全歐洲從羅馬尼亞南部平原起直到英吉利常綠的田野止、這些地帶、正赤燄滔滔的時候、面蘇聨集體農莊的農民、已開始向旱魃宣戰、卒能將那極惡的炎威打退下來、據南俄各地來者説、雖有幾許地方受着苦楚、但就全部説、今年可以有與平常一樣的收穫、或竟可以超過、　　其所以有這個結果主要原因、當歸功於農民有組織的鬥爭、這鬥爭是在全國一致的運動領導之下進行的、而且各地土地部·以及中央和地方報紙都作擴大的宣傳、</p>
<h3>一種多方面的運動</h3>
<p>這是一種多方面的運動、第一步、利用科學在抗旱問題上、作一切貢獻、爲了運用科學上的貢獻、就廣泛地集體活動、第二步、就在今春完成了一千萬畝的耘早播種、（這批播種從溶雪裏得着充分的水量）又播種二百五十萬畝的（萌芽的種子）、（這是蘇聨在近幾年來推行的一種方法、由這批種子所得的水分、比早播要多些、）但這些都是收成保險的慣例、蘇聨南部和東南部、均時常施行的、當蘇聨旱魃爲虐到了劇烈時、特别運動就開始了、其地點在卡巴廷洛·培爾卡里自治區、這些地方、從前被視爲無能的民族、現在却因這回運動被認爲民族中最善組織者、並且得着（列寗勳章）的奬賞、</p>
<h3>他們不依賴天雨</h3>
<p>上述區域的地位、在高加索山脈東北斜面上、恰在最乾燥地帶的中央、但其中也有許多山泉浸潤着、在其首都召集的一次會議上、老年農民和（烏大爾尼克）（突擊工作員）曾通過採取特别灌溉法、用合作的力量、利用山水急流、三天之内、幾十公里的灌溉溝渠、就在卡巴廷洛·培爾卡里開掘起來了、彼輩農民、並有一個（我們的收成不靠天雨）的口號、從南方種榖的各地、都有消息傳來、説那邊也有同樣的抗旱運動、脱熱普爾·彼得洛夫斯克、就是最有成效的一處、在收穫前集體農塲農民會議上、議决採取特種抗旱法内、包含下列幾點、（一）耕田時、要留意保存土壤的濕氣、（二）播種田間、每一雜草要連根拔除、（三）低濕之地或林中空地、都應種晚期榖類、以備在旱災損害冬麥田的地上、再行播種、（四）凡能灌溉的地方、如脱熱普爾河流域及其他園地、都應有組織的行動下灌溉起來、　　在薩拉托夫·和史達林格勒特·兩省内許多部份、找出方法從許多池沼或溪流裏施行灌溉、平常荒蕪之地、如池沼溪湖等、今年都行種植了、有的水淺的地方、也在其泥土上播下種子、另一種同樣重要的方法、是立刻再行耕種由久旱枯死冬麥的田地、中央的農民報紙、載有許多科學的論文、精確地指示再種的方法、以適用於各地、現在業已證明了、遼遠的南方在收過小麥和冬麥的田地上、竟可收到第二次種下的熱粟、在北部烏克蘭也同樣獲得粟的豐收、并且他們還擬種植其他的糧食、</p>
<h3>復種的結果</h3>
<p>農民部的播種表、經當地報告復種的結果、如克里米、今春播種已超過其計劃百分之十、其大半是額外的播種、是爲補償旱魃所受的損失、乾燥的四月·五月·接着又是潮濕的六月、這差不多各年各處都是一樣的、今年自不例外、第二次的播種、可以得充分的水分、克里米來的報告、就指明雖有一二處地方整個一季内没有下雨、但遵守着適當的農作法則的農莊、已獲收穫、　　現在全國計劃下的集體化的方法、已使蘇聨農民制勝旱魃、但這樣的最近還從土爾克盟尼的人造雨研究院、傳達一個新聞出來、説蘇聨在不久的將來、會發明一種更多雨量的管理法、　　這研究院設在蘇聨最乾燥的地點、在四面圍着炎熱的土爾克盟尼沙地的阿希赫巴特、這研究院在今年整個春季中、已舉行過不少的實騐、收有很好的成效、不僅在濃厚的雲裏、即在含有些微雨量的所謂疊雲裏、也能收效、　　據從地面上觀察這種演習者的叙述、説在五七分鐘之間、飛機過後、雲裏就發現一條淡白色綫、這綫在全雲呈現雪白色時就消失了、在雲下面忽又現出一黑色的雨帶、最初落下的雨、滴小而參有化學品質、一瞬間、就有和平常落雨一般的水滴落下來、這時的雲也分散了、</p>
<h3>一個造雨的經騐</h3>
<p>最近在（眞理報）的一篇論文裏、一個飛行者叙述他造雨的經歷如一盹（我從各方面衝過雲霧、當時天空鎭靜、在我駕的飛機的翼上或頭上没有一點潮濕、我將化學混合品灑在雲上、而後在下面旋轉地飛着、雨就開始下落了、我再飛入雲裏、那里也有雨了、飛機立刻潮濕了、飛機的周圍發出一種尖聲、好像雷鳴一樣）　　飛機儘管輪流追逐疊雲、在這飛機往返之間、雲都化成爲雨、在百分之六十六的塲合、雨降時無異驟雨一陣、百分三十四的塲合、或被風吹散、直到牠再蒸化升空、倘這試騐是遇着雨雲時日末百分之九十的雲、立刻便沉澱下來如降大雨</p>
<h3>人造霧</h3>
<p>這研究院并不以此造雨自滿、反之牠還在進取、在五月裏的一個晴天、阿希赫巴特城裏曾用人工法造成滿尺迷霧、四天之内、幾步以外不能見物、這人造務具有天然的一切特質、含有濕氣牠由焚燒某些化學品來造成的、這些化學品能使天空的濕氣沉澱、就是在最熱最乾燥的日子在氣層中總有充分的水氣、祇要使牠沉澱就可得十到二十耗的雨量、　　該院第二步驟、（現正在研究）是要用造霧那種方法在青天白日下造出雲來、再使這人造雲沉澱成雨、無疑地、他們在本季終期前後、會吾有好的成績報告出來、　　雨的科學管理（或曰統制）法、顯然是社會主義社會爲盡量適鹽其發展而要求的進步之一、但是、假如資本主義世界也推行人造雨、那就間題來了、得雨區和雲正浮過去的區域之間、便發生一種爭執、一種與資本主義本質而俱來的矛盾現象、冀南</p>

<p>本市新聞</p>
<p>昨又有</p>
<h3>三千六百萬現銀出口</h3>
<p>三千四百萬元運英倫　　一百七十餘萬兩運美自美國通過白銀法案後、上海洋商銀行、卽陸續裝運大批現銀出口、分往英美各國、先後已有七批、共運去六千餘萬元、均經本報詳載、至昨日下午三時半、英郵船倫浦拉出口、又裝出第八次現銀、至三千四百餘萬元之鉅、合前七次、已達九千五百萬元、其數殊足驚人、</p>
<h3>鉅額運英</h3>
<p>昨日出口現銀、爲近數月來最大之一批、當二十日下午、卽由洋商各銀行、向大英公司接洽裝船、一面託茂泰報關行代運、本報早經探悉、惟因船未離滬、暫不發表、總計報裝銀行、有匯豐·麥加利·大英·運通·大通·東方·中法·等十六家、、出口現銀現洋、有五千二百數十箱、大條三千三百零六條、折合實數、約有三千四百餘萬元、其中最多者、以匯豐銀行一千一百五十萬元、大英銀行七百萬元、麥加利銀行七百萬元、花旗銀行四百餘萬元、其餘各數十萬元不等、</p>
<h3>裝運愼密</h3>
<p>此次大批白銀、均係運往英倫、以數目過巨、分兩天駁裝、各銀行辦理、十分愼密、亦託茂泰派拖駁、運到十二十三兩號河筒、轉上英郵船倫浦拉號銀倉中、駁運時、派有武裝警察保護、二十日裝下二千萬、昨日上午、續裝一千四百餘萬、正午十二時、全數運齊、聞大英公司、可得運費二十萬零四千元、事前頗覺秘密、昨日午三時半、已經離滬出口矣、</p>
<h3>一批裝美</h3>
<p>昨日、尚有裝往美國紐約現銀一批、亦係各外銀行報運、共有大條銀一千五百餘根、另有銀寳銀幣等、合計銀一百七十餘萬兩、係交大來洋行格蘭總統號輪承裝、亦於昨日出口、此銀係先到西雅圖、再轉運至紐約、</p>
<h3>運銀理由</h3>
<p>據報裝現銀某銀行職員、與記者談、歷次運往國外白銀、均爲上海各外銀行庫存現銀、因近年進出口貿易不振、各銀行囤積巨額現銀、不能使之生息、實不合算、故裝往國外出售、或轉購黄金、亦未可知、與中國金融市塲、絶少影響也云、各方重視</p>
<h3>鉅量白銀運出</h3>
<p>截至昨日止約達九千萬元　　銀行界一致主張救濟辦法　　實行統制貿易與統制現銀自美國將白銀收歸國有後、我國逐日均有鉅量白銀運出、截止昨日止據本市某大銀行調查、其運出白銀總數、約達九千萬元、是以引起各方嚴重注意、茲將新新社記者昨日所探得各情、分誌於次、</p>

<p>自美國提高銀價後、我國無日不有鉅量現銀出口、致引起全市金融界特别注意、截至昨日止、據本市某大銀行調查、其流出現銀總數、約達九千萬元、出口原因、當然係美國提高銀價關係、但裝出情形、約有下列兩種、（一）投機者圖利、（凡由滬運英倫一百萬元、除一切開支外、可凈餘六七萬元、是以投機者相繼而起、）（二）在華外商銀行、深防中央政府增加白銀出口税、或禁止現銀出口、因此釀成現時之局面、但財政部長孔祥熙氏爲安定市面計、業經表示决不施行上列辦法、據聞本市銀行界數度會商結果、僉認我爲入超國、若不實行統制貿易、（卽减少輸入、設法增加輸出、）與統制現銀及平衡銀價、（卽我國與國外銀價成水平綫、）等方針外、别無救濟良策、至目前現銀流出、因國際貿易、尚無甚大關係、且歷年華商各銀行在底充實、故尚不足爲慮云、</p>

<h3>幾個書本上的問題</h3>
<p>——答葉蘭圃君　　最近有許多讀者對於所讀的書能够很仔細很有系統地提出很多的問題，這證明大家讀書的熱誠是大大的增加了。例如前次杜洛基君在唯物論教程一書中提出了六十幾個問題，現在葉蘭圃君又提出了一家族，私有財産及國家的起源）一書中的二十幾個問題，在（婦女與教會）及（古代社會）二書中也提出了一二十個問題。讀者諸君這樣地認眞努力，不但使找們非常高興，非常感動，並且藉讀者所提出的問題，使我們發現了許多我們素來注意不到的書本上的錯誤和疑難，這些錯誤和疑難是一切讀者都會碰到的，所以以我們就將這些問題擇重要的公開發表。前次在（翻譯本的錯誤和疑難）一題中，我們已公開答覆了杜君的二三十個問題，現在再將葉君所問的一家族私有財産及國家的起源）一書中的問題逐條答覆如下：　　問：（我們根據摩爾根在這裏所描寫的人類由蒙味野蠻以至文明開端的進化光景，……因爲直接由生産描出，所以無可爭論的。但若把這幅光景和當我們研究之終展開在眼前的全景一相比較，牠就會顯出貧弱與暗澹的色相出。）（三六頁）這段怎解？　　答：這是説莫爾根用人類的生産來解釋人類社會由蒙昧而野蠻以至文明的進化，這是很正確的方法。但是那所説的一切只是槪括的叙述，當我們詳細研究之後，便覺得槪括的叙述是不够的。　　問：（又若嚴密的一夫一妻制算是至上的道德的話，那麽椰子葉（勝利之象徴－譯者）應當歸於條蟲所有，因在牠的五十個乃至一百個體節中，都有一套完全的生殖器，而且終生在各個體節中行各自的交接）（四四頁）是指的什麽意思？勝利的象徴何解。　　答：椰子是樹名，它的葉子被西歐人當做勝利的代表物。（勝利的（象徴）即勝利的代表之意。這是説假若嚴密的一夫一妻制（即一女不嫁二夫，一夫不娶二妻）是至上道德的話。那末勝利就屬於條蟲了，因爲它每一節中都有一套雌雄生殖器，而且終生各自交接。</p>
<p>問：（因此説到動物的婚姻，就要引我們回到那一點上，即正爲我們所當永遠離去的））四八頁）這話怎説？是那一點上？離去什麽？　　答：就是説人類的婚姻與動物的婚姻不同。動物的婚姻常常因嫉妒而破壞了集團生活，但人類的原始的婚姻，則爲了社會的必要而克服嫉妒，結果形成了集團婚，一那一點）就是指集團生活的破壞。　　問：一自後，我們知道了集團婚其他幾種形態，現在又覺得摩爾根在這方面走到極端了。）（六一頁）這句話怎解。　　答：摩爾根認爲集團婚是必然的先於對偶婚而一般的通行的，據恩格斯的研究在對偶婚存在之前也有其他種過渡的婚姻形態存在。所以覺得摩爾根的主張在這方面是有過分的偏倚了。　　問：自六四頁（在皮相的觀察者）句起至六五頁（事實上正行着一種嚴格的法則）句止，這一段不知道怎樣解？　　答：這段是説明一夫多妻制的時候，集團婚的法則還存在着。如（講與一妻給他的客人過夜）的事情。（未完）</p>

<h3>迎人和咬人</h3>
<p>— 越僑</p>
<p>報載紹興的某鄉，農民們因爲旱荒，迎神求雨，看客有帶帽的，便用刀棒亂打他一通。</p>
<p>這是迷信，但是有根據的。漢先儒董仲舒先生就有祈雨法，什魔用寡婦，關城門，烏烟癉氣，其古怪與道士無異，而未嘗爲今儒所訂正。雖在通都大邑，現在也還有天師作法，長官禁屠，閙得沸反盈天，何嘗惹出一點口知？至于打帽，那是因爲恐怕看見還很有人悠然自得，不垂哀憐，一面則也憎惡他的不與大家其患難。</p>
<p>迎神，農民們的本意是在救死的——但可惜是迷信，——但除此之外，他們也不知道别一樣。</p>
<p>報又載有一個六十多歲的老黨員，出而勸阻迎神，被大家一頓打，終于咬斷了喉管，死掉了。</p>
<p>這是妄信，但是也根據的。（精忠説岳全傳）説張俊陷害忠良，終被衆人咬死，人心爲之大快。因此鄉間就向來有一個傳説，謂咬死了人，皇帝必赦，我不知道法律，但大約民國以前的律文中，恐怕也未必有這樣的規定罷。</p>
<p>咬人，農民們的本意是在逃死的——但可惜是妄信，——但除此之外，他們也不知道别一樣。</p>
<p>想救死，想逃死，適所以自速其死，哀哉！</p>
<p>自從由帝國成爲民國以來，上層的改變是不少了，無教育的農民，却還示得到一點什麽新的有益的東西，依然是舊日的迷信，舊日的訛傳，在拚命的救死和逃死中自速其死。</p>
<p>這回他們要得到天討。他們要駭怕，但因爲不解天討的緣故，他們也要不平。待到這駭怕和不平忘記了，就只有迷信訛傳剩着，待到下一次水旱災荒的時候，依然是迎神，咬人。</p>
<p>這悲劇何時完結呢？</p>
<h3>高爾基的意見</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>－開於文學不死大禍大止－</p>
<p>大衆語的建設，其最後目的是在建設大衆文化。純粹的大衆文化當然要等大衆自己來建設，但在大衆還没有這力量的時候，爲大衆的文化工作者，必須設法使他們有這力量把他們養成也是文化的工作者。給與文化人的養成以最好的援助的，有兩種勢力，一種是科學，一種是藝術。高爾基曾論及這件事，他以爲（和自然科學相並，雖然不在牠之上，然而也不在牠之下地，給與人類的智力和意志以感化的强有力的手段者，是藝術的文學。這是差不多没有人否定的吧？）但他以爲否定這事的人們還是有的，那是：（一邊説教着（生活構成着意識）的史的唯物論的公式，一邊却見不到而且不相信這意識有創造新的活動力的力量的人們或各種迷信者。）原來，迷信科學工藝文而大呌（文學不死，大禍不止）的，並不是只有我們的吳稚暉先生，在（勞動階級應當養成文化的工作者）一文中，高爾基便舉着許我這樣的人們，而加以批判。我現在將這文章的兩段，抄錄在這里，給大家看看，在對於吳先生的理論的評價上，也許不無幫助罷？</p>
<p>高氏説：（在我國，文學之教育的意義底評價方面弄得不很好，不，正確地説來，是弄得完全不好，尤其在地方上可以認到這點。例如（蘇維埃西伯利亞）這地方報紙編輯者考勒斯－聽説以前是無政府主義者－便組織了對於文學的迫害，而且爲他底贊助者之一的潘克蘆信這人。還聲明道：（藝術的文學這種東西，本質上是反動的。）這不消説是對於故人（烈夫）（藝術底左翼戰綫）底理論的田舍式的解釋。從我底觀點看來－不是部分的觀點，乃即是五十多年地觀察了文學底革命的教育的意義而來的，並且現在也在我觀察着的這我底觀點看來，則潘克蘆信不但是淺學的年少者，並且是我可以稱之爲在文化事業領域内的無意識的（害毒者）的人。還有，在報紙上原是没着文藝欄的，但根進這個人，對文學會員這樣聲明道：（黨及蘇維埃官憲，不發給登載詩和小説用的紙張）。這樣，文藝欄是被撤廢了。</p>
<p>（同志羅木夫，在我國的一種雜誌上發表了一篇（非黨的文化事業底五年計劃）的短論文。像在青年評論家底論文上常常可以看見的一樣，在這論文上也有頗多的引用文，而且還以這些引用文來證明國立出版恊會印刷古典作品是對於勞動階級有害的。但我以爲這評論家，除出引用文以外怕還有知道别的什麽事情的必要吧。例如圖書館底報紙報告書似的東西，便應該知道的－在這報告書之中，勞動者大衆對於舊的作家底作品的肯定的態度，是在數目字上可以看見的。還有，（波里斯·戈陀諾夫），（農奴），巴爾扎克底（農夫，契訶夫底（農民），波密洛夫斯基底（市人底幸福），布寗底（農村），其他關於近的過去的數百種的這種的事實小説，同志羅木夫果然能否證明牠們對於勞動者有害是可疑的。羅木夫式，潘克蘆信式，根進式底太主觀的評價之豐富和無根據，只是使言語底混亂旺盛起來罷了，只是將那到達從勞動者大衆之中養成文化底工作者這一定目的的近路底進行，弄成無政府罷了。）</p>
<p>據高氏的意見，則連過去的古典文學中的有些作品，對於大衆，也未必是有害的，這就是（接受遺産）這事的道理罷。但這且按下不表，總之，我要告訴的，是高爾基怎樣地批判了俄國的反對文學的人的見解而已。</p>
<h3>（進化）與（奴化）</h3>
<p>— 湼之</p>
<p>（歐化）是必要嗎？（國粹一應必留嗎？對子這些問題的答覆，只能是相對的，而不能作絶對的。關键就在于它本身的（及時價值）上來定取捨標準。卽是説，誰合環境的需要，誰便有（採取）（保留）的價值；誰成了歷史的障礙物，或者遠不及時以（明天）來代替（今天），誰只好送進歷史博物館或放入預備隊裏里去。不過地球是圓形的，（超時）往往會與（過時）合併，好像六路圓路的電車由直徑下再開下去仍會走原來的方向。所以，（歐化）是不是爲西人侵略張目？（國粹）是不是會毒死國人？全在把握住（時代進化）的動向來下判斷：（適者生存，不適者淘汰），誰也逃避不了這條自然暹輯的規律呵！</p>
<p>手工業總算是（國粹）了，在現時，我們主張仍然保住手工業呢，還是採取（歐化）了的機械工業呢？大槪只要不是痴子，誰也明白（開倒車）的手工業是不能謀經濟出路的。保守下去只有毒死！（其實，你要保守也不容你保守。）然則採取機械工業嗎？機械在于外國，販進來就有（歐化）嫌疑，有意無意的要爲西人的侵略張目。那末怎麽辦呢？（因噎廢食）連機械工業也一併不要嗎？不成功！我們應來分别清楚：（進化）是一回事，（奴化）又是一回事，這就是説：（國粹）比較（歐粹）眞的落伍了，那末不採用也只好採用。不信！指幾條例：吳淞鐵路上第一輛火車不是給國粹先生們送進海裏去嗎？現時怎樣呢，恐怕國粹先生們没有火車也會感覺生活不便罷－電燈自來水都是（來路貨），站在國粹觀點講話，應把及早消滅，可是到了今日，龍虎山張法師的信徒們打起醮來也要借重五光十色的電珠；佛教徒的（玄妙觀）（功德林），吃的，用的，没有一樣不是自來水。這是什麽玩意兒呢？難道今之主張保存國粹的典型人物比張門人與佛教徒還有更進步的嗎？</p>
<p>可見進化是無法阻碍的，落伍只有趕上去。管牠（歐化）了好，（亞化）也罷</p>
<p>其次，來説（奴化）。奴隸有好幾種解釋：甲受乙的宰割，忍氣吞聲，唯命是從，固然是甲作乙的奴隸；然而人類不能利用自然，反處處爲自然征服：寅年水災，卯年旱災，地震過了，繼以颶風，那也可説人類作了自然的奴隸。作人與人之間的奴隸，原不應該，而人作自然的奴隸亦所不當。所以被壓迫民族甘受帝國主義的剝削是（奴化），主張復古不會利用自然硬開倒車也是（奴化）！明白了這一層，什麽問題至于如文體上强學歐化，使讀者不易懂得，這是（學的人）的罪惡，進化的（歐化）本身不任其咎；然而有人因其（學得不當）主張向後復古，抬出文言的活屍來自耀，那無異反對（高跟）而主張（纏足）。這類（國粹），是不應保留的，是應當反對的。</p>
<h3>買辦</h3>
<h3>逃難記（上）</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>鄉村應該是呌人懷念的，可是在今日一提到它便有些恐怖的印象來了。</p>
<p>春假住在她家裏，簡直忘了自己是客，只覺得日子過得太痛快。徐媽的兒子明天定親央我寫了大條紅的雙喜字，她眞是從心裏喜，還請我明日吃喜麫呢。就是這天下午，汽車道上嗚嗚的一直没有斷。（劉黑七快到了！）以前只是嚷，由於這兵車的證明，可眞是（快到了！）姨娘没命的收拾東西，什麽像片坐鐘以至於破皮鞋，都用筐子一趟一趟的運到後面的一間小屋子裏去。累得滿臉汗。這種工作我是看慣了的，我也暗笑過了的，但是這時我却做了她的助手，因爲聽過了她一次長篇的經騐談，自己也覺得這一陣收拾實在算不了過分的慌張。</p>
<p>（夜裏要醒睡點！）這是姨娘給我們的警告。夜裏我們的眼睡了，可是心却半醒著。忽然半夜裏她推醒了我，側著耳朶驚惶的説（你聽，吹號！）（什麽號，是鷄呌！）我笑了，她這才解去了臉上恐懼的神色。</p>
<p>（快，快起來！）推開門姨娘進來了，（快走！）她又返身出去了。這時天還没亮，落著小雨。我倆像一雙木鷄立在外門口裏。（咚咚！）西牆上有人跳過來。六嫂從後屋裏也跑過來了。她牽著我從女厠所的一個牆洞裏爬到西鄰劉媽家去。屋裏没有大人，兩個小女孩睡得死死的。我倆爬到炕上去，彼此都硬著嘴説不害怕安慰對方，這眞是一個自哄自的法子。</p>
<p>劉媽進來了。她説不用害怕，大約是兵，在街上公買公賣的。她的話自然不是誑，因爲她就在門前照應買賣。不過她的觀察對不對可没有誰敢担保了。一陣（快走）催我們躱到這間小屋裏來，然而事實到底怎樣，没法知道。只覺得爬過牆洞來的那一刹，心下有脱險了的快樂。</p>
<h3>悼</h3>
<p>— 胡今虚</p>
<p>一朶憔悴的花，從寂寞的秋夜裏飄落到寂寞的國土——拖曳過絲絲的殘香在幽冥之中，浮蕩着縷縷的哀怨在誰的心頭。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>誰的心頭浮蕩着縷縷的哀怨，幽冥之中拖曳過絲絲的殘香——從寂寞的秋夜裏，飄落了一朶憔悴的花到寂寞的國土。</p>
<h3>老人（十）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>（這就是了，老爹，我眞怕丢了，好容易纔檢起來的）</p>
<p>亞利賽高興得幾乎哭出來，把那方印刷品送到他的手裏，那上面是有着一個銅版肖像，下面還有兩三行英文的説明。</p>
<p>（您看，這不是沙夏麽？有多麽漂亮，我就知道這小夥子必會驚人的！）</p>
<p>他仔細地望着，雖然肖像上的那個人是梳得光光的頭髮，穿了紳士的禮服，他也一下就看得出來，那就是二年前離開了他的沙夏。</p>
<p>（他的神情可眞不差，眼睛是那麽有神采……）</p>
<p>這他可是只在自己的心中如此想着，並没有説出口來；而且這時候他覺着自己的嘴是變得笨了，（還好像有一點發着抖），就是想説話也許一個字也不能説出來。他像釘住了一樣地望着那個肖像，那眼睛裏冒着年青的神采；他的心爲欣悦塞得滿了，他的眼睛裏一層一層地蒙着眼涙。他的手，微微地戰顫着。</p>
<p>許久之後，他纔很吃力地，囁嚅地問着：</p>
<p>（你！你，知道這下面説些什麽話？）</p>
<p>（我怎麽能懂英文呢？今天我還問過兩個顧客，他們也不懂。）</p>
<p>他點着頭，可是並没有把眼睛抬起來望着，當着亞利賽説話的時候。</p>
<p>（你是從那裏找來的呢？）</p>
<p>（這是我從舊紙店買來包牛肉的，您不記得我總要用不少舊報紙麽？從前沙夏，就常歡喜到我那裏去檢着畫報。有一天一個老婦人到我那裏買了一（分得）（註）的小牛肉，順便拿了一張紙包給她，就看見這張像。我又拿了另外一張給她包好，留下這張來，總想着給您送來看看，沙夏這孩子一個人在外面，倒像是都很好的。）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來速各家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>這是德國商人自用的車子，本來是不搭客的。那汽車夫在潼關對德國人説，這兩個人是公路上的。你旣然是到西北來作汽車生意，怎好不聨絡他們？德國人一想，帶兩個人到西安去，車子也不會多消耗一斤油，有的是地位，就答應了作個順水人情。汽車夫又對張李二人説：你若是打票搭客車去的話，每人要六塊錢，搭這車子去，每人三塊錢得了。公路上有人查問，我們這裏有外國人，我説一聲一家公司的就過去了。這二位爲了可省半價，也就跟了這貨車，坐着這最高級的座位前去。這位李士廉先生，雖然在江蘇内地，包辦過印花税，當過警佐，但是在上海的日子爲多，生平那裏吃過這樣的苦。人坐在木箱子縫裏，一捲舖蓋上，車子飛跑，人是前後左右亂幌，這若摔下車子去的話，不死也要去三分之二的命。自己不敢伸直腰，兩手抓住面前，一隻網籃，死也不放。上面一點遮蓋没有，那三月裏的太陽，已有相當的猛烈，頭上雖戴了毡帽，只遮得住半邊臉，這還罷了，只要車子偶然停一停，或者由快略微走慢些，那四個車輪子捲起來的黄土，隨着風勢，不分耳目鼻口，袖口領圈，如撒網倒水一般，向人身上撲來。他也知道西北是重樸實的，在綢夾袍子外，罩了一件藍布大褂。可是在撤過黄土之後，藍布大褂立刻就變成夾布大褂了。他正惹了一身灰，在衣袋裏抽出一條白手絹，滿身撣灰。那個天津人王老五看到，就向他道：你何必撣灰，汽車不到站，這土總是要括的。（二）</p>
<h3>秋話</h3>
<p>— 周子欣</p>
<p>氣温是没有减低，在心靈上總有些那火熱的炎夏不久的就須消逝了的意念。</p>
<p>秋天覺得是最快感的一個季節，春天是太淫艷，夏天是過於炎熱，冬季是太寒峭！祇有秋季，纔是適合一般的季節，就來呌它一個大衆的季節吧！它没有淫艷的景象，來勾引起一般的苦悶；它没有炎熱的陽光，灼人肌膚；它更没有凛冽的寒風，酷冷的冰霜，在一般的平民身上壓迫施威。</p>
<p>蟬啊！我眞有些爲你擔心，從秋季起，你的壽命是可危呀，在夏季你是何等的高傲，目空一切的唱着高曠之曲，那時，誰都不在艷羨，稱頌，但此刻你雖深自的悔恨，也許是遲了一些哩！難免受人的譏誚。</p>
<p>秋，我眞艷羨你，我眞喜悦你，我艷羨你的光景如畫，我喜悦你的風日宜人；我庭園中的老少年，兩端光鋭，長橢形的葉子，長的葉柄，也吹成了紅黄斑爛的點紋，眞是使我時常的熱戀着！使我解脱一切的苦悶，見了妍麗的老少年；就連想到你的可愛啊！</p>
<p>秋呀！我望你永駐在人間，再不要逝去，你眞是一般平民們依戀的季節！</p>
<h3>滴點</h3>
<p>— （鵑）</p>
<p>昔人（汗滴禾下土）的詩句兒，描寫農人力田之苦，入木三分。今年江南大旱，赤地萬里，可憐他們連禾也没有了！所有的，只是汗，只是涙，只是血！</p>
<h3>放鴨</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>從一個茅草和稻桿繩組成的一個立方體的鴨欄内，我們在午前，午後，跑到那裏，是沉默的，是寂靜的，是冷淡得和墳墓一樣，一點生氣都没有。</p>
<p>鴨性喜水而不喜旱，鄉村間養鴨，專在看放上用工夫，每天晨雞初唱，東方吐出魚肚白色的時候，放鴨的人將鴨欄打開，那成千成百的鴨羣，從呷嗚呷嗚的聲浪裏，整個的身段摇撼着向外跑，溪邊，岸旁，鴨羣很有紀律的擺動在水裏，放鴨的人駕了一隻小如木桶似的小舟，竹稿一點，從呷嗚呷嗚蚩蚩不斷的水浪聲裏向前進，竹篙是撑着船，鴨羣見了篙影，好似推磨的驢子見了鞭影一樣，他們拚命似的簸動兩足，向前不住的划盪着。</p>
<p>在一個寂靜的河流中，水是淙淙的鳴着，鴨羣是靜默的停止在潮濕的泥土旁，剔毛的是在剔毛，刷羽的是在刷羽，他們的情調，是很舒適，是很散漫的，到了一個規定的時間，放鴨的人從似睡非睡的情調裏驚醒，取了許多榖粒，撒潑在水面，打了一聲唿哨，鴨君蜂擁上來奪取榖粒，這時好似兵隊作爭奪戰一般，水花是向河岸上不住的濺潑。</p>
<p>放鴨的人從曉星未落趕着鴨羣，直到夕陽在山，將鴨子趕到栅欄裏，才得休息一下，他們含辛茹苦，是爲的鴨卵收入可觀，可是自從農村經濟破産，鷄鴨卵市價大跌，農村副業一蹶不振，他們雖然仍趕着鴨羣，在日曬雨淋的氛圍裏掙扎着，但是環境之惡劣，已遠不如從前來得舒適。</p>
<h3>你搶我奪</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>然而太后雖不接見他們，或者他們自己也知道太后决不能讓他們進見，但他們無論怎樣膽大，也不敢偷這一次懶；每個人都在火車夫到以前，趕上車站來了。他們的唯一的目標，祇願太后對於站上的佈置，表示滿意，四周也不見有半個閑人，這樣他們便可以安心了。不過他們還是很膽小，儘在距離列車較遠的所在，忙着亂着，誰也不敢擅自走近過來。我打車窗邊遠遠地望過去，但見許多穿着五顔六色的公服的人，列成了約莫半公里長的一行，蠕蠕地在擠動；大家都透着一種誠惶誠恐的神氣，拚命在張羅。可是憑事實來説，他們所忙亂的都是些無關緊要的事情，跟太后或這列車，永遠不會有什麽益處，眞所謂（無一足取）：只是這尾鯽魚，總算差强人意。</p>
<p>説到鯽魚，大槪誰也免不掉要食指大動吧？鯽魚原是一種滋味很美的魚類，尤其當它才出水的時候煮起來，那味兒便格外的鮮美。尋常富貴人家的筵席上，我們往往可以見到這一味佳餚。有些歡喜講究吃的人，爲着要誇耀他自己的富有，和對於吃的講究起見，每喜在高朋滿座的時候，臨時教當差們用挺大的木盆子，盛着幾味生趣盎然的鯽魚捧到客人的面前來，請他們隨意挑出一尾，立刻拿進去洗剝烹煮；有些人竟會教他家裏的廚夫當着客人的面前，把他們所挑中的一尾鯽魚，立卽洗剝起來，以表示絶對不再掉換。</p>
<p>太后在豐台站上所收受的那幾尾鯽魚，也曾經我逐一騐看過，因爲太后自己不願意和那些官員見面，所以就派我去充代表；我騐看的結果是很滿意，没一尾魚不是活潑潑地在遊泳。但我們並不曾教我們的廚夫來當塲把它殺死。大槪太后的個性雖然是特别的堅毅果斷，然他不忍眼睜睜地的瞧着一尾魚在伊自己面前畢命。（一一一）</p>
<h3>王瞎子</h3>
<p>— 春雨樓主</p>
<p>記得在蘇州供職的時候，公畢以後，閒着没事，就走到一家雜貨舖中去坐一會，談談山海經。雜貨舖的對門是一家銅錫店，銅錫店的老闆是非常吝嗇的，常常尅扣夥友們的伙食，而自己又喜硬撑塲面。</p>
<p>老闆姓王，眇一目，人人呼他王瞎子，他也不以爲忤。他所開設的銅錫店，没有十年，已成了小康之家。他一面督飭夥友們工作，一面又很省儉，自然容易致富了。他每天吃過了晚飯，拿了一根旱烟管，靠在店門口，緩緩地吸烟。雜貨舖中的幾個夥友是常和他打趣的。</p>
<p>（王瞎子老闆！今天吃什麽菜下飯？）</p>
<p>（嘸啥吃，猪油墩醬。）</p>
<p>其實今天的夥友是吃了整天的素，原來他幾根鬍鬚上是用猪油皮揩的，所以很油亮。天天晚上在吹牛吃了葷，店中幾個小夥友却十分痛恨。一天下午，有一個頑皮的小夥計，偷偷地在他洗臉巾旁掛的猪油皮上，擦了些　。他晚飯吃過照例在洗臉處旁掛的猪油皮揩些油在嘴上。走到門前，口中啣着旱烟。</p>
<p>（王瞎子老閭！今天什麽菜下飯。）</p>
<p>（嘸啥吃，乾菜燒肉。）</p>
<p>（不對，另有什麽菜？你鬚上黄黄是）什麽？）</p>
<p>他在鬚上一捋，果見有黄色帶有臭味，連忙回答説：（開洋炒蛋。）他跑到裏面見猪油皮上的糞，大大的震努，可是一個小夥計在格格地悶笑。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<h3>地球的年齡</h3>
<p>地球的壽命，究竟有多少長呢？全世界科學家，都經過苦心的研究，總不能判斷下來。最近美國華盛頓開國際地質學會，波士敦泰夫支大學雷因教授，把全世界地質學，天文學，物理學，機械科學，數學等所有學者的意見，綜合起來，發表驚異的意見，他説：我們爲調查地球的年齡，用了種種獨特的四十種機械，（好比二十世紀發明的宇宙計之類，）測量的結果，計算地球自從瓦斯體凝固以來，過了十八億五千二百歲後，就要毁滅了。這種計算，是用銑的作用時計，與其他三十九種特殊機械，經過幾百人的頭腦，精密的推定出來的。</p>
<h3>宇宙的廣度</h3>
<p>我們生存的大空，究竟有多少廣呢？自古以來的數學家，哲學家，思索家，考據家，到了現在，還不明白，所以這神秘的謎，依然難以解决。最近北美加利福尼亞維爾松天文臺學者威康雪太博士，就過去數年來，在天文臺所裝置的百英吋望遠鏡中，觀測天體，加上細密的數理計算，推定宇宙的廣，其直徑在二億光年與二十億光年間，（一光年就是光在一年間走過的距離）光的速度二秒間，可走十兆基羅米突，所以斷定宇宙的直徑，爲十兆基羅米突的十億倍。</p>
<h3>二百年後的人</h3>
<p>美國紐約心理學者台維得西裴利博士，最近在芝加哥發表奇異的學説，他説，就過去十年間，調查人類的狀况，瘋癲的人，其增加率達百分之三十，因爲人類的神經衰弱與精神病的發作，逐年大增。預料到了西曆二千一百卅九年，全世界人類，完全都要患精神病，弄得瘋瘋癲癲。瘋癲的原因，大槪從（憂慮）而起的，譬如有錢的人，要憂慮綁票和錢的用途，無錢的人，要憂慮衣食住行，中産階級，要憂慮維持現狀，於是上中下三級人們，遂都患精神病了。博士是把批評家熱心家，頑固人，聰明人等的善良性格，詳細的實騐結果而説的。</p>
<h3>萬年前的麵包</h3>
<p>在瑞士的湖畔，發見了七千年前的麵包，這麵包已變爲炭化，大的有四十磅重，小的約八磅，經過考古學者的研究，是在一萬年以前的東西，就是當時在喜馬拉耶山的大靈峯，有一對夫妻，在石洞中生活，靠太陽的光和熱，製成的麵包，根據這傳説，研究麵包的歷史確有一萬年的。</p>
<h3>一蛋值四千元</h3>
<p>美國哈密爾登大學，有一個價值三千七百元的蛋，爲前世記怪獸（恐龍）所生的蛋。是從中國某古玩家中買去的，前月有一竊賊，潛入該大學，想去偷這蛋，幸藏在自動警報箱内，没有偷去，聽説這蛋，已變爲玉質，夜間能放光彩，用手觸之，冬熱夏凉，實爲稀世的寳貝。</p>
<h3>世界第一高塔</h3>
<p>美國最近在芝加哥密西甘湖邊建造全世界最高的塔，高達二千零六十三呎，是由技師富蘭克爰蘭特所設計，需費三百萬元，圍柱的柱身，在千九百三十三呎的點，有百呎平方的瞭望台，又在千呎的點，百八十呎平方的瞭望台，這塔比法國巴黎的爰夫爾鐵塔，要高千零七十九呎，所以爲全世界最高的塔。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一位美國教授底日本戲法</h3>
<p>— 咏</p>
<p>那是一件容晚的事；只要找一個相熟的美國教授，給他相當的材料，給他一切出版書籍所需要的東西，另外送給一張數字較爲巨大的支票，這是頂要緊的、最近在日本出版界有一本（滿洲國之鳥瞰）出現了，是一本用美國式裝訂的英文書籍。</p>
<p>書的著者是美國前加利佛尼亞工藝學院院長詹姆斯·先萊爾博士。爲要使這本書有興味，有豐富的内容，他就穿着日本的服裝向幾世紀前底歷史深遠處開始所謂科學的探討。</p>
<p>在整個的第一章裏，他説明中國人之所以建築萬里長城者，就是爲了要隔絶滿洲人。由這位美國教授所找到的這歷史根據，就證明强佔東三省的日本帝國主義者并没有破壞中國任何權利，而只是日本繼續着中國建築萬里長城的歷史使命，中國人民未能完成的歷史使命。這樣説來，日本并不是中國的敵人，反而是中國人的好朋友。</p>
<p>假使中國人不懂得這一個道理，那末，中國更會不得了。中國人不懂得的原因、一者他們是純粹的個人主義者；二者他們的居心是狡猾的。實際上，請看中國弄得各列强已到了何等危迫的地步！</p>
<p>中國人是世界上最富激動性的外交家，博士這樣肯定的説着。她的外交原則（以暴攻暴，）玩弄列强，使牠們互相殘殺。</p>
<p>現在我們可以明瞭，帝國主義者在中國的爭鬥是從何而來？這完全是中國外交家奔走挑動的結果。這證據何在呢？有的，在這些奔走挑動的者的旅行箱裏什麽都有。日俄戰爭是由中國組成的。别人不知道嗎？但是這位先萊爾博士是知道的。</p>
<p>博士的證據還多啦請聽吧，他説，中國在國際聨盟中的勝利，在拉西曼博士恊助下所得到的勝利，這就是證據之二。假使要問，中國獲得的是什麽勝利？日本非但没有退還滿洲，而且還佔據了熱河，并正在侵略華北和蒙古實現其佔覇整個中國成東亞完大帝國之好夢，中國勝利在那是？這位博士便慢慢答道：這是無關緊要的，中國的勝利纔是巨大哩，你們不要忘記：可憐的日本在强佔滿洲以後就和李頓調查團正面衝突了！</p>
<p>博士暢然地叙述他的證據：誰都知道，日内瓦一塲惡鬥的結果，是中國勝利了，這就使日本處於不利的地位，孤立起來了。不僅此也，由這影響，使東京和華盛頓穿過太平洋而遥遥作對起來了，現在應該誰都明白了，日美間的對立從何而生？這對立是由中國外交家挑動起來的。</p>
<p>總之：遠東罪惡的根源是中國。遠東的根本問題不是日本而在中國，今日的中國非但成爲中國本身的危險，而且成爲全世界的毒藥，他是日本生命的重創。在東亞祇有日本是擁護建築在秩序上的管理底思想，對於這思想西歐人士也正是信仰着的。日本犯了錯誤嗎？那末，全世界都犯了錯誤！日本要在中國的無政府狀態和蘇聨赤色恐怖之間建設一個模範國家當作緩衝地，這對中國是一個好教訓；而且日本這種做法，不止是爲了自己的安全，也正是爲全世界效勞呵！</p>
<p>這位穿着日本外衣的美國教授，更露骨地顯示他的面目，爲澈底貫串採李頓調查團報告書中的公式作爲解决中國問題的方式起見：他説出老實的話來：（中國問題的滿意解决，就在於國際恊作，以供中國内部之政策。）</p>
<p>這位美國教授的這套戲法，是更高明了，他穿着東洋裝建議瓜分中國，自然會更有聲色，更動聽聞。</p>
<p>上面那些話只是關於解决整個中國問題的，關於（滿洲國，）這位博士怎樣（鳥瞰）的呢？他説，那邊那像什麽都解决了，一切都好得了不得。滿洲已經是天堂了，雖然日本人的生活程度要高過中國農民生活程度的兩倍，但這没有關係，滿洲國是地上的天堂，滿洲的農民也是人間最幸福的了。他在其中揷了許多歌功頌德的圖畫其中有一幅兩個面帶笑容的青年帶了鐝立着，這就是象徴那天堂裏的農民的生活的。</p>
<p>這些相片從何而來？書的箸作者在序言裏説得明白：（我對（滿洲國））和日本政府底禮待，非常感激，她們供給我坐着飛機廣遍地攝取影片。）</p>
<p>這位美國教授底日本戲法是另緻的，他的（滿洲國的鳥瞰，）是眞的坐着日本飛機在天堂中鳥瞰出來的。</p>
<p>現在應該明白了，資本主義的大海裏，没有滴水是帶着正義人道的色彩的，但中國人，尤其是想和美國要好的人，却還正在昏昏大夢！</p>
<h3>楓葉紅了！</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>楓葉紅了</p>
<p>那赤紅底楓葉，一片一片地從窗口飄了進來，飄着，飄着，恰恰都落在吾底寫字檯上。</p>
<p>（唉！楓葉紅了，秋天了；光陰眞迅速呵！）吾不禁嘆了一口氣，把檯上的楓葉收拾了。吾怕過秋天；因爲秋天裏底一花一木，一景一物，都含着無限底傷感；它實在太容易動人愁懷了！（試寫秋心便是愁！）的確，秋天是一個感人底季節！</p>
<p>秋天底命運，正如老年人一樣；生命便消失了生氣，一切在春天裏活潑的可愛的，這時都似乎罩上了一層灰色的陰黯底外衣，顯出了那凋零的，蕭殺底景象。</p>
<p>記得在十年以前底一個秋天，吾給生活底牽繩拉到了都市裏來之後，到現在整整已有十個年頭。雖然在這十年當中，吾也曾（重返故鄉）了不知若干次，但生活底中心總是維繫在都市裏的，在都市裏底生活，總脱不了出賣汗血和勞力；甚至，有時連靈魂也得出賣一下的。在終日奔波栗六之下，景况實堪悲慘了；所以吾並没有閑暇去體騐人生底眞意味，吾只知和别人一樣，以爲人不過是一架吃飯做事底機器罷了；縱然還有些别的責任，但吾却没有嘗到。</p>
<p>人們都是世界舞臺上底一個角色；當然，角色也有不同的，有生，旦，凈，丑底分别。一個人當從他母親底懷裏呱呱墮地底時候，本來都是一樣的，後來因爲各人扮演底角色不同而塗抹了些白粉，紅油，黑墨之類，也有裝上一撮假鬚的，于是出現在這世界舞臺上底盡是些戴了假面具底醜惡怪現狀了。又爲了要使這世界舞臺更熱閙些，便不絶地互相殘殺，互相吞噬起來！不幸得很，吾也打入了這個漩渦，變成了世界舞臺上底一個角色，但不知是凈還是丑？或者是生抑是且？吾自己實在不知道，也許别人看得出吾的；不，他們自己也正不知自己是一個什麽角色呢！吾跟着别人一樣，天亮了起來吃飯做事，天黑了去睡覺；一天一天底把光陰送走。從没心思去計數過今天是什麽日子？看見人家赤膊了，纔曉得已是夏天，吾也同樣底赤起膊來，表示吾也懂得熱了。看見人家身上穿上棉衣了，又知道已經冬天，吾也照樣穿起棉衣來；等到綠草萌了芽，百花吐着葩，明白這是春天到了；楓葉紅了，草莖萎了，吾毫不又遲疑底覺悟這見秋天。吾眞是一個（滿面風霜不知年）底流浪人兒！離鄉十年，别了老家也是十年，十年，這十年來流浪飄泊底生活，毁滅了吾底靈魂！悲哀麻痺了吾底神經！勞苦毒壞了吾底肢體！吾從前美麗底幻夢，終于給醜惡底現實破滅了！光明底前程，已經被一座命運底屏障遮住了！吾現在底心裏，髣髴空虚得像一片曠野底沙漠，吾又好比似一隻孤舟，航行在一望無際底大海洋裏，任它蕩漾，任它飄浮，但旣躭心着巨鯨來吞噬，又恐懼着氷島底傾瀉，此去茫茫，不知何處是彼岸？</p>
<p>吾過去底生活，只是一個醜惡底噩夢；現實底生活，又陷入了悲苦底深淵裏了；未來底前途，又是那末黑暗，那末恐怖的，使吾没有勇氣向前面望一下。吾已在那人生生活之途上奔波了十多年，十多年底經歷告訴吾，才知道人生原來是兒戲，一年一年底過去，一齣一齣底扮演，無非都是些醜惡底戲劇。反正做人不浮游塵世，遊戲人間，何必一定要去追根究底；等到戲劇終塲時，一切都是完了，完了！吾想：</p>
<p>如今楓葉已經紅了，纔知道秋天又已來臨！（前塵似夢，影事如潮）使吾想起了舊事，又不免要悲傷起來了！</p>
<p>（咳！楓葉紅了，秋天；光陰眞迅速呵。</p>
<h3>秋夜</h3>
<p>— 蔚南</p>
<p>一望是那麽茫茫的，雖然算是有了路燈，但這（光明）的努力，實難打破這黑暗的悽寂。在這裏，象徴了人生的一切，世態底畸形。在星星的閃爍裏，在柔弱的路燈裏，這糢糊的都市中的曠野，是需要一個無邊的摸索；有眼睛底盲人呵，一定的是有連二連三的觔斗。這裏是有人生之途一樣底崎嶇，一樣底巗峻，匍匐着這裏的人們呀！</p>
<p>夏天雖是在秋之追擊裏，歛去牠底狰獰的形態，但氤氲的秋氛，還有一點留戀着這煩悶的潑婦，在我憑窗的時候，我不禁又牽憶起我農村裏的秋夜來：</p>
<p>是初秋的晚上吧？同樣的是現在一樣底秋夜，有星星，有流雲，有殘缺的月，一樣的有黑暗的悽森，但蚊子比這裏更多，秋蟲比這裏更稠，更呌：在田中，在曠野，在堤上，在林頭，在階下，在整個底自然之中呵。然而促織催忙了辛勤的農婦，但不是織衣裳，穿針綫，也不是在家裏，而是在帮丈夫做着農事呵－拚命的在堤畔碌碌地車水。谷谷的聲音，潑動着小河裏的水，粉碎着整個的天空，動摇着矗立堤上的高樹。（疲勞）在這裏，好像是失去了形態，失去了依賴；更在他們的心裏，是像没有這種東西的存在。喁喁的私語，雖水波不動這自然裏的流浪，但那甜和的有生氣的雰圍是叢住了這整個的農村底周遭</p>
<p>飢饉之魔是被他們打倒了，雖然他們自己是這般勤勞，但是他們不覺得。一個有生命的甜和的農村的秋夜呀！但是現在的農村怎樣了？飢饉，災荒，天災人禍繞遍了牠底全身：是病態的悲哀底畸形！</p>
<p>然而在這裏－都市裏特有的，獨創的曠野底荒凉呀，在這樣的秋夜裏，祇有使想起了，往昔的繁榮，悲哀着現在的悽寂。天空裏那閃閃的彈涙也似的星星，被雲遮了殘月，慘呌的蟋蟀，都在弔唁着這裏的悲慘！</p>
<p>那邊不是有電炬輝煌嗎？是倫敦，是巴黎，是耶路撤冷？有坐汽車的有錢人，有没衣穿的窮孩子；有癟三，有大亨；有天堂，有地獄，有安樂，也有悲哀，在這無邊的魔氛裏。在這裏，祇有茫茫的秋夜，蒙着茫茫的黑暗，茫茫的甲住了這罪惡的大地！</p>
<h3>歸來</h3>
<p>— 辛沁</p>
<p>船在不住的動盪，我的心更顫摇！船越近汕島，我的心越慌忙，不知怎樣才好！船入港的時候，週身有些跳躍起來。久别的故鄉呵，突然的見了面，無論我如何的頑固；但嶺南的風味，已給南風飄進我的内心，我禁不住被飄起了無限的懷感！船入碼嶼口了，我的心冷凉凉之中，湧上了一股温柔的辛酸涙！我的腦子和眼睛四週，好像流溢着什麽波濤。</p>
<p>故鄉終於是故鄉，不能使我這個流浪人安居的故鄉，我這時覺得可愛，又感到層恨。秀雅的山頭，大小的羅列在海邊，那就是故土了！漸漸的漁船越多了。遠遠的水波上，飄着一葉輕舟。我看不清楚是什麽，那就是在白浪裏打滾的漁舟呵！我呆立在甲板上，驚疑不定的注看着。水波上的黑點漸漸現了，立在小舟子上的漁人，就像一支草。波濤一高，舟子卽浮；波濤趨下，舟子就好像淹没了。我替他們乾急，一下子立刻又浮上來，舟子上並没有水湧入。</p>
<p>覺石山就在船邊了，那清秀幽雅的山上，一切的景物，使我心傷又神往！是多麽幽美之所！然而，我這個流浪人，那能有機緣和牠相處！流浪人，只配東飄西流，落在像垃圾堆的地方。我想到城市裏的小亭子間生活，眞羨那幽曠的覺石山上的屋子樓房。但這只是使我加增了一層嫌惡而已！我没有這種閒情呵！</p>
<p>船到了海關前，故鄉的音響，似已隠約聽到。我無神氣的目光不住的在向這前面的景物點頭。不過我這個滿身重創的人，終於只是索無味道的走上岸來。</p>
<p>在碼頭上嘈雜的人聲中，只行了幾步路，汕島上的街道中的故鄉風情，就温柔的飄迎上來。特别那沿街的店子擺着的各種各樣的水菓，好像望之生津，一陣陣的濃香透出。鮮紅的荔枝，怪可人的躺着，一粒粒，肥肥的。我這個寂寞的人也不覺微笑了。</p>
<p>我就像重見了久别的故人，一霎間忘了痛苦。呵，踏上了汕島！心裏一時確是輕鬆了一些。</p>
<p>但是，當我細味了汕島上的一切時，我又是陷入了昏茫的苦悶中。見了鄉人，他們那一五一十的故事滔滔的向我訴説。</p>
<p>那破亡的故鄉的哀情，一切都變得多快！踏上汕島半天，我漸漸的，快要窒息了。復古和破産的革命策源地之一角，－汕島我説不出什麽了！</p>
<h3>蘇茜姑娘</h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>時間像流水一般的逝去了，幾年前的天眞，活潑，人們慣稱她爲快步之神的蘇茜姑娘，已經隨着逝水的流連，而不復再像往日那般的快步與爛漫了－在這幾年飄泊的掙扎生活中，她更深深的感到：在這樣的社會裏，一切的人們的慘酷和罪惡，都是由于這社會的組織不良之所致啊！</p>
<p>早上，軟軟的曉風吹來，在天空，只有幾片白雲，和一輪臼紅的，剛升起來的太陽，反映在地上，由窗口透進她的屋子裏，這時的蘇茜姑娘，不禁更追憶到自己是處在怎樣一個（現實）的環境裏，在這（現實）的環境裏没有自由，人們彼此却是兇險的，狡滑的，卑鄙，罪惡的。爲着這樣，整天的挣扎在生活的鞭打之下的蘇茜姑娘，她有着一個很豐富的靈魂，企圖到一個比較賣笑的，美麗的，和善的，人們都是互相帮助，互相愛護的另一塊地方去。每當眼前的環境壓迫着她更利害的時候，這許多輾轉不息的念頭，就似乎要飛迸出她的腦海，她的精神上因而又開始感到無窮的快慰。</p>
<p>險惡的浪頭，一個一個的打着她二十餘年所必經的路程，她都安然過去，而且揚帆邁進，現在她終于在這社會上，在女界中獲得了頭等奬譽，是一顆光明的星！</p>
<p>每當月白風清的夜晚，蘇茜姑娘總是獨個的跑在附近的一所花園裏去乘凉，散步，沉默着就在花園裏躑躅不休，最後的一抹陽光已經去了，滿園子蒼蒼茫茫，夜色正從樹叢中爬出來，臼外擴張，園裏的樹枝上，池沼邊，又射出了一道電燈光，照耀着整個的園裏，水凉的晚風，吹拂她的衣襟，她倚坐水旁，昻首四顧，自己覺得是應該超脱這社會而生存的，艱苦的奮鬥，才是人生的眞實意義啊！她這樣不斷的在社會上努力了二十餘年，如今是還很健壯的生活着，興奮的在叢叢荆棘中，拔出她前途的光明來，我希望的蘇茜姑娘啊，努力吧！</p>

<p>— 柳郎</p>
<p>那個不知那個不曉的美人魚楊秀瓊女士，此次應聘歸來，京滬各地，無不極力捧塲，十分起勁，大有令人發生不重生男重生女之慨。</p>
<p>因此報章騰載，極口揄揚，并且風箏大王爲之拉繮，招摇過市，各報不但登載其事實，而且印刷其照片，不但中國報紙盡力宣傳，而且外國報紙亦爲之張揚其盛舉，此眞民國以來之新佳話也，爰擬竹枝詞二首，以紀其事：</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>聞名原不是傳虚，浪裏白條張順如。盡道拉繮姿拐好，無人不羨美我魚。</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>秀才不做做奴才，過市招摇亦快哉。妬煞啦寛小四子，馬鞭揚處美人來。</p>
<h3>死光</h3>
<p>歐洲大戰後，列强痛定思痛，極羨我們精神文明，還於列强間締結了許多盟約，但自九一八以來，許多盟約，多爲侵略國家所扯破，槪不發生效力，因此列强又積極備戰，幾位科學家，抛棄一切，專門研究殺人利器。</p>
<p>如某國擴充空軍計劃，某國建造戰艦計劃，至於器械方面，各有各的發明，如日本發明的飛機捕獲網，德國發明某種大砲，卽如科學最落後的我國，亦有飛雷飛箭等的發明，其他各國可以不講。</p>
<p>所以第二次世界大戰不發生則已，假定第二次大戰眞要發生，則其大戰時的死亡率，當超過第一次大戰數倍，或竟至數百倍以上，而新發明殺人利器中，所最厲害的，便要算美國台斯拉博士所發明的一種（死光），據説，此物發明後，將令戰爭爲不可能，一霎那頃能斃百萬生靈，這個傢伙，最爲厲害了，卽全球的人類，不消被牠幾個霎那，可死得一乾二淨，不亦快哉。</p>
<h3>車中</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>立秋之後，害了兩天小小的病，而向公司中請的假期是五天，就到鄉下去走一趟。回鄉的那天起了個絶早，坐在黄包車到車站去，披襟當風，想着這短短的三天也是我的幸福時期了。</p>
<p>到車站爲時尚早，乘客稀少，我佔了車廂一角，讀着當天的報紙及帶的幾册小説；這是我行旅的消遣方法，好像東翻西閲可以縮短旅程似的，不然，就是狂吸烟捲了。</p>
<p>到了開車時間，車中已擠滿了人。夏天誰都願意起早，尤其出門人做賈買的；以最遠路程算，到了目的地還有大半的時間。如其到什麽地方去避暑那是乘夜車的了，時間在於他們是那樣的不值錢。我想着後悔趕早車，乘午車比較熱一點，大家怕熱而乘客一稀少也怪舒服的；現在車廂中都是人，有的擠不着座位坐在行李上而，把這條狹狹的走道擠滿了，還有賣零食的車販來來往往，呌人頭痛，趕早市的出門人一定塡飽了肚子來的，雖然西瓜賣掉許多，車廂裏郤更難下足了。</p>
<p>這時候我没有東翻西閲的勇氣了，這就是説我狂抽着烟捲。面太陽的那邊已把木窗閉上，車中更不乏同此嗜好的，烟霧没有出路，儘在各人頭頂上盤旋，心中彷彿就要作惡，嚼了幾顆人丹，掉回頭瞧瞧窗外吧。</p>
<p>悶居在都市中的人，接觸到無邊際的田野：那些塌毁的牛車棚，戴着箬笠的農夫，甚至一條癩皮狗，也感覺别有情趣。我靠在窗口，目送着大地向後逝去，郤一些勾引不起往昔的情趣來，彷彿眼前是一片慘狀，枯萎了的田秧，小河浜翻了底，看着，看着，我這次回鄉眞是多事；家鄉一定也是這般情形，老母更添了幾絲銀髮，弟弟不再蹦蹦跳跳了。如其沉湎在都市中，或者可以享到三天的清福，我幾次想在最近的車站上下車轉回上海。</p>
<p>然而最近一站已是家鄉了，聽了洩長的鄉音（ＸＸ下－車）就找到了那個呌喊的人，端詳着他的面部，想搜尋出我回鄉的理由來。那是一張不認識的臉！像都市中一樣的臉，把笨重的行李駝上背背，越過鐵道，搬進車站去　　　　唉唷！唉唷）微弱的聲音。</p>
<p>我踏着不平的石子路向家中走去，火車拉長了回聲，向許多人的家鄉駛去。</p>

<h3>五家鎭上一件大事（二）</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>大門以内是怎樣景况呢？所有富公公家的近親都到全了：族長伍老太爺，富生的舅父張得福，富公公的塡房舅兄朱全貴，兩位姑太太和姑老爺，再有堂兄族兄，據説修家譜的時候，這樣到齊過一次。</p>
<p>他們分了许多小組談談隣鎭的新聞，今年秋成的預測，再不然，彼此取笑着打哈哈，態度都是那樣自然，消閑，絶不像門外人的猜想。</p>
<p>富公公今天當然分外的忙碌，他吩咐僕人每個親戚到的時候擰手巾，砌茶，他更是裏裏外外趕着似的出進，連他終年不離手的旱烟袋也像大兒子討親時的第二次放下手。富生呢，有禮貌地在每個親長面前對答幾句，惟有他的二個小兄弟在天然几旁玩弄他們剛捕來的幾頭蟋蟀。</p>
<p>這樣騷騷然的情形，直到伍老太爺踏到大廳來纔沉靜下來。他們向老大爺打個招呼，就近的人慢慢地圍攏來，較遠的也把坐位多向老太爺方面，這一件秘密的事似乎都等着伍老太爺來説一句話。</p>
<p>伍老太爺並不客氣，在正中太師椅中坐定了。他接過僕人擰上來的手巾，很謹愼地撩起他齊整的鬍鬚，揩了一個面，再舉起杯來向周圍掃了一遍平淡無奇地説：</p>
<p>（今天熱了！）</p>
<p>周圍的人舒了一口氣，有的重覆了一句（今天熱了！）大槪是僕人們通報了，富公公從裏面跑出來，便拱着手説：</p>
<p>（大伯伯，這末大熱天，勞駕了。）</p>
<p>伍老太爺彷彿没有聽見，接過僕人授上來的旱烟袋自顧抽起烟來。周圍的人互相交換了視綫，再從富公公身上射到伍老太爺的旱烟袋上來。</p>
<p>這樣靜默了幾秒鐘，可以聽見遠處送來的蟬聲。</p>
<p>伍老太爺抽罷一通烟，掄起他奕奕的神目，看見富公公搓着手注視着他。</p>
<p>（富明，你是什麽意思，先説出來聽聽。）族長開始今天的正題了。</p>
<p>（大伯伯）富公公向廳屋内打了轉（二弟故世了十多年，富生旣嗣出在他名下，現在已娶了媳婦，這一份財産的權，我也好放手了，所以有勞幾位親戚…………）</p>
<p>伍老太爺世故地點了點頭，（你的弟媳呢？）</p>
<p>（她不肯出來，説一切由大柏柏作主。）　　富生的舅父張得福牽動了一下嘴角，想説話被伍老太爺搶先了。</p>
<p>（你先把租簿攤出來，我們對過了再説。）</p>

<h3>武俠神怪復活的意義紅茶</h3>
<p>— 紅茶</p>
<p>最近電影界關於武俠片秘密攝製的消息，甚囂塵上。同時，電檢會方面，也有開禁若干武俠神怪片的風説。</p>
<p>在這風説一起來的時候，（輿論）方面對此有兩種見解：</p>
<p>第一以爲新的電影失去了南洋的市塲，而使中國電影界普徧的不景氣。所以，攝製武俠神怪片，是中國電影事業的强心針。</p>
<p>第二是電影會查禁很多内容前進的影片，給影片商人不痛慴，因此，他們想唯一般商人開映武俠神怪片來補償他們。</p>
<p>大體上説來這二種見解，都不差的。同時，兩種見解都嫌把問題處理得太簡單化了。</p>
<p>不錯我們也知道南洋的觀衆是歡迎武俠神怪片的。在幾年以前，武俠神怪片，的確在南洋賺過錢。但是我們只要一考察武俠神怪片的在南洋，臨的禁止的一二年，較之前幾年，所得的潤利，已經顯得大大的低落。這低落只是説明南洋觀衆，對於神怪武俠片的厭倦是不够的。主要的是南洋的經濟情形猛烈的衰退。樹膠的價格，較前跌到幾十倍以下。是以所共知的事。在這情形之下，而要神怪武俠片市塲不衰退，是不可能的。至於最近，那末南洋的經濟情形，因爲全世界的經濟危機，而更衰落。大資本家爲陳嘉庚等，尚且不免於破産，其他更不必説。所以目前的中國電影界，還是追求着當初武俠神怪片的黄金時代，而不惜秘密攝製，至少是一個冒險舉動，老實説現在的南洋武俠神怪片的市塲，是更不似臨近禁止這一二年的。</p>
<p>至於所謂補償電影界的損失，也是皮相之見。在目前中國社會是有人意識的想使他回復到中世厄去。揚鈴唸佛，牛鬼蛇神，以及什麽舊道德等等提倡無一不是這個用意。各地的規定服裝，南方的隔絶男女，其尤著者。同時他們更知道一切配合的有力量，在文學方面高呼文言文復興。在電影方面，一隻手（製服）前進的作品，一手隻放在武俠神怪片，絶對不是偶然的。</p>
<p>我們也知道在這年頭，有許多是很艱難的，所以所謂（體惜商艱）等等根本是體惜自己的艱難罷了。但是計劃雖佳其奈時代不許何？</p>
<p>讓一切該死的死去罷，我這樣的想。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（販酒大王）</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>The　Mad　Ganme——大上海</p>
<p>作爲藝術園地之主要領域的電影誰都明白，它和其他的藝術一樣，無論如何，它不會超越階級而存在。換句話説，任何藝術家都得執行他們自身階級的任務。而（販酒大王）固然是極平庸的作品，但是在作爲於美國統治者有利的一點上看來，（販酒大王）是不應當給我們忽視的。</p>
<p>從劇作者取材於流氓盜黨之羣，我們便可證明他的企圖。</p>
<p>一般的説，同樣是盜匪的題材，假使在寫實主義的立塲上觀察，那末必然的會尋求着盜匪的社會根據，而科學的説明盜匪的産生及其消滅。結果，眞正寫實主義的作品，一定不能有利於上層階級的東西。就因爲這個原故，（販酒大王）的劇作者，便緊緊抓住流氓的落後的觀念，所謂他們的犯法妄爲，販私酒，綁票，殺人，可是當他們稍有機會的時候，便立刻爲統治者所利用，而效忠於政府。於是卡森便被譽爲英雄，當他救出了法官子媳的肉票之後。</p>
<p>不容解説，這是有利於現行政治的。他寫盜匪的自相殘殺，他寫盜匪的毫無仁義，結果是盜匪絶跡，而天下太平。這種張開眼睛的夢囈，在我們是認爲幼稚而拙劣可笑的。</p>
<p>另一方面，劇作者在（生意眼）的立塲上，他以爲這種題材是可以賣錢的。可是因爲盜匪的題材之平凡化與庸俗化，並不如他所想像的那般美滿。我們雖然説導演有些地方，的確是很聰明而簡潔週到，可是在故事的决定之下，他也不能超越劇本的範圍。劇本害了導演，在此可得着充分的例證。</p>

<h3>好萊塢匪患猖獗一斑</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>好萊塢因爲是世界同等大小城市中的最富之區，所以綁匪之風，亦很猖獗，或者不亞於上海，但是防禦的周密聽説比上海好得多。可是許多大明星，仍舊是惴惴不安，因此好萊塢的一種新興事業，就是綁票保險。那裏有一家勞合保險公司，去年接受各明星的匪險總額，竟達三百萬美金之多。倘使加上地方當局，各公司以及各影星們，所共同用在防止綁匪工作的金錢，其錢確實很可觀了。</p>
<p>明星們的惴惴不安，或者並不是全無理由的。不久以前，茂琳黛維絲的車子，夜間從外面回來。半路上霍的跳出一輛汽車，將他的車子攔住了去路。那輛汽車裏跳下來幾個武裝的大漢。幸虧茂琳不在車子裏，那些人撲了一個空，咒駡着倉皇而去了。诸如此類的事情，好萊塢是數見不鮮的。平克勞斯貝和史本塞却西，都收到了許多恐嚇信。許多明星們的電話，本來是秘密的，但是匪徒們竟常常打電話去威脅他們。據警察當局們説，這都是不要緊的，他們的目的，不過恐嚇而已。眞正的綁匪。决不費工夫，來事先通知你的。瑪琳黛德麗許最近接到一封恐嚇信，裏面的字，是一個一個從報上剪下來，貼着拚凑而成的。這是或者她知道的朋友惡作劇，怕她認出筆跡來。但是瑪琳却不能處之泰然。却利卓别靈聽説去年被綁過一次，他曾付了二萬五千的贖欵，但却利自己，却不肯承認。</p>
<p>防止綁匪最感到困難的，就是有被綁資格的不能合作。他們，尤以女明星的爲然，爲息事寗人計，往往收受了恐嚇信，不肯聲張，而和匪徒私下接洽了，這是足以壯匪徒們的胆，而使事態愈覺嚴重化的。</p>

<h3>巴黎（娜娜）訟案中原告反成被告趣聞</h3>
<p>— 塵雄</p>
<p>法國文豪左拉所著的小説（娜娜），自去年被聨美影片公司攝爲有聲影片之後，因爲主演者爲一個當代蘇俄女明星，該片開映時，很爲各界所注意，不過在原著者生産地方——法國——却發生了一件訟案。</p>
<p>（娜娜）在巴黎開映時，卽被法庭傳票戲院禁止開映。起訴的人，就是左拉的兩個後裔，理由就是（娜娜）影片與原著小説太相背馳了。這案件開審數次，都無結果，而這部法國名著，巴黎的人始終爲法律問題而無眼福飽嘗一番。</p>
<p>最近起訴人以（娜娜）影片旣禁映於巴黎，就認爲這是他們的勝利已達到，要求撤回訴狀，免至牽累下去。但是聨美公司方面則表示不能承認原告勝利，因爲聨美所以不把（娜娜）影片在巴黎開映原故，是讓其他影片先排的開映，并非有什麽糾葛而致不能開演。聨美要求這案件繼續開審，一定能證明原著者的後裔已把攝影權賣給了出片人而聨美有將（娜娜）影片在任何地方開演的特權。因此他們的律師曾寫了一張訴狀給左拉的後裔，説如果他們想禁止（娜娜）開映的話，除非他們退還聨美公司一萬三千三百元的攝影權酬勞費，但是左拉的後裔至今還没有答覆這個訴狀。</p>
<p>巴黎法庭因爲被告人不肯將案結束，反要起訴原告人，故這宗案件恐怕比較倫敦法庭判罰米高梅公司攝製（拉斯蒲丁）案，還要困難得多了。</p>

<h3>争愛得子（Doctor　Monica）（三）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>曼麗默默地想着，在那寂靜的屋子裏，將一切的影子，放大了照在牆上，使她心中有些惴惴不安起來。要是約翰不是離得她這樣遠，那情景就兩樣了。她於是又閉了眼睛，默默地想着。她好像覺得他的頭，貼在她的酥胸，他的臂，摟住了她的織腰……那天晚上，他們最後的一晚。她又好像聽見了他的聲音。（你知道我最愛的是你。爲什麽我們總要替蒙尼卡想呢？况且她亦决不願意我們作大犧牲的……）約翰反復的説。可是曼麗道：（我們不能使她感受痛苦。况且她是你的夫人。你是屬於她的。她亦是……我的朋友）最後的幾個字，差不多低得聽不見了。可是現在約翰已離她遠去了。她感受到喪失，寂寞，不可忍受的空虚。她心想要是約翰能够突然地從天而降，那她一定要不顧一切，就是蒙尼卡，她亦不在乎了。不對……她又想回來了，蒙尼卡總是在乎的。這種無窮無盡的思索，在她腦筋裏盤旋反覆着，没有一個止境。她覺得無計排除，於是就走到安娜的身邊，想尋句話打破這可怖的岑寂。她問道：（我再給你斟杯酒，好不好？）安娜道：（不要，不要。我這裏的還喝不了哩。我這工作，怎麽完得了？明天我還要送到建築展覽會去哩。）曼麗有意無意的，向那圖案板上望過去。她説道：（哦那就是蒙尼卡常常提到的那種嵌進式的住宅房子嗎？）安娜頭也不抬，回答道：（這是許多種類的一種標凖模型。要是蒙尼卡的發明，得到了一個贊成的人，那我就有事做了。）（那眞是太好了。）曼麗説着，可是並没有什麽興緻。等了一等，她又説道：（我再喝一杯，好不好？）安娜道：（好，好。你喝好了。）可是她怪樣地，看着曼麗自己調着酒，自己喝着。她知道曼麗平常不大喝酒的。這個時候，蒙尼卡站了起來，走到電話那裏。她自言自語道：（讓我看，都律醫生什麽號碼？）她開始撥號碼了。安娜看着她奇怪道：（唔，從什麽時候起，你開始和那個大傢伙商量醫務的？）蒙尼卡笑道：（不是什麽醫務，是我自己的事情。）安娜瞟了她一眼，表示很不贊成的樣子問道：（你眞的要去受手術嗎？）蒙尼卡道：（這就是我所以不陪約翰到歐洲去的惟一原因。）安娜大聲爭論道：（我從來没有聽見過這種奇事。）蒙尼卡已經開始向電話簡説話了。可是她一回又將電話掛了起來，表示非常失望似的道：（豈有此理！都律亦出門去了，要一個月纔回來哩。）她回到火爐前面，點了一支香烟，自言自語道：（我還想在這一星期，一切都弄好了呢。）她忿忿地一口一口烟噴着説道：（這眞要呌人急死了。）安娜在旁邊吩咐道：（我勸你還是用心在你的工作上面吧。或者你不久會忘記的。）她亦站了起來，點了一支香烟吸着。這時曼麗又喝了一口酒，在沙發的一個角落裏縮做一團。安娜又説道：（眞奇怪。像你這樣一個人，我眞不明白要生個孩子做什麽用？）蒙尼卡等着道：（我替人家接了多少孩子，到這世界上來，我應當自己亦有一份權利。况且約翰一定是很喜歡的。）（未完）</p>

<h3>Opening to Maran-yu Rejected</h3>
<p>Japanese Captain Uses Pretext to Obstruct    Currently Stationed in Xinglong Town Awaiting Orders    Japanese Troops Impose Martial Law in Maran-yu    Yin Rugeng Visits Chaisan Urging Qing Imperial Family to Quickly Determine Personnel to Guard the Eastern Tombs    (Tianjin) The Second Detachment, Second Company, of the Second Security Corps of the War Zone, dispatched to Maran-yu to protect the Qing tombs, led by Company Commander Su Xuewen, arrived on the 18th. However, the Japanese army captain stationed in Maran-yu, Miyama, suddenly refused entry to our security team, claiming that the number of personnel and firearms did not match the agreement made in Peiping. Currently, the detachment is stationed in Xinglong Town, awaiting new negotiations by Yin Tixin. Yin has telegraphed Yin Rugeng for instructions. Starting from the 19th, the Japanese troops in Maran-yu suddenly began organizing electric wire networks outside the city, setting up sentry posts, with troops patrolling back and forth, and inspecting pedestrians. The brigade commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Chengde, Tanimoto Itsukio, accompanied by more than ten staff members, flew from Chengde to Maran-yu on the 19th to review the Japanese troops, and announced that the Japanese troops stationed at various passes along the Great Wall will simultaneously conduct joint land-air exercises on the 5th of next month. A large detachment of Japanese troops will also be deployed to participate in the exercises, which will last for about five days to a week. (21st Dispatch)    (Peiping) Major Kato of the 7th Division Infantry of the Japanese Garrison in Rehe, along with Quartermaster Major Soran Nobunaga, arrived in Peiping by plane from Chengde yesterday morning. They immediately went to the Japanese Embassy to meet with Chaisan to discuss important matters. In the afternoon, they went to Tianjin to meet with the Japanese Army Commander Umezu to report on something. After completing their business, they returned to Peiping from Tianjin, and flew back to Chengde on the same plane at 3 PM. (21st Dispatch)    (Peiping) The Ninth Company of the Second Security Corps of the Ji-Mi District, led by Company Commander Qi Baokun, has been ordered to proceed to Shimen Town in preparation for taking over the defense of the Eastern Tombs. Qi led his troops to Shimen last night. Upon the receipt of the Eastern Tombs, Qi's troops will take over the guard duty. (21st Dispatch)    (Peiping) The selection of Qing imperial family members for the Eastern Tombs Preservation Committee is about to be decided. The Ji-Mi District Commissioner has repeatedly urged Zai Tao, Zai Run, Pu Yi, and others, the responsible persons of the office for handling matters relating to the two tombs. Yin Rugeng also visited Chaisan today to inquire about everything. (21st Dispatch)    (Peiping) Yin Rugeng stated that the difficulties in receiving the Eastern Tombs lie in the Qing imperial representative not being appointed and the Peiping-Yu traffic not being restored. The war zone is building roads, and a meeting will be held tomorrow to discuss this. Funding has not yet been raised. (21st Dispatch)    (Peiping) Yin Rugeng visited Chaisan on the 26th to discuss the issue of receiving Maran-yu. It is rumored that the reason for the delayed reception is that the Qing imperial representative for the Eastern Tombs Preservation Committee has not yet been appointed.

<h3>Scheduled to be Established in Bailing Temple</h3>
<p>Two Councilors to Represent He and Zhao in Sitting in Command    (Peiping) The Mongolian Autonomous Guidance Commissioner's Office is scheduled to be established in Bailing Temple. Prince Guo has returned to the temple to report the progress to the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee. After further consultation in Peiping, everything can be decided. The organization of the Commissioner's Office was originally planned to have two departments and six sections, but there is now talk of changing it to one department and three sections, which can be divided into military affairs, political affairs, investigation, and documentation. The office's funding is set at 4,000 yuan per month. Because the Director of Guidance, He Yingqin, and the Deputy Director, Zhao Daiwen, each have special responsibilities in Peiping and Jin, they cannot constantly be in command. Two councilors have been specially appointed to represent He and Zhao and permanently stationed in the temple to handle all matters. The councilors, He Jingwu and Shi Huayan, have already been officially appointed by the Central Government. He is in Peiping, and Shi is currently in Baotou. After the establishment of the office, the two will go to Bailing Temple to take charge of the office's affairs. (21st Dispatch) Japanese Strip Away</p>
<h3>Military Power of Puppet Army Leaders</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Due to the tense situation regarding the Russo-puppet sale of the railway, the Japanese are very suspicious of the puppet army leaders. However, they are unwilling to simply expel them all. Therefore, they are adopting a "discard the bow when the birds are all shot down" policy. They have established a puppet General's Office in Changchun, with content roughly similar to the organization of the General's Office during the Beiyang government era. All the puppet army leaders have been given the title of General of the General's Office and transferred back to Changchun, so that they relinquish their military power. On the other hand, in order to prevent the Russian army from descending from Kulun after a breakdown in Russo-puppet negotiations, they have established a military academy in Western Mongolia, forcing Mongolian youths to enlist. They are also building an airfield and setting up a radio station in the area, in preparation for a potential Sino-Russian conflict. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch) Yang Hou's Small Band</p>

Boatmen on both banks were unable to rescue them in time. In Yutian, the Huanxiang River overflowed with heavy water on the 18th, with five breaches in the dikes. More than a thousand houses along the banks were swept away. The masses fled to the tops of trees. County Magistrate Chen Baosheng and gentry merchants are doing their best to provide disaster relief. The Yunmei and Dou Rivers in Fengrun County have flooded greatly, leaving more than 800 disaster-stricken people. In the cotton-producing areas around Xuanwangzhuang, the cotton is infested with worms due to excessive rain, and the harvest is hopeless. The prices of rice and wheat are also soaring.

According to an official telegram from Baode, heavy rains and mountain torrents occurred in the county a few days ago. At the same time, the Yellow River flooded, overflowing its banks and submerging the eastern gate of the county. All business houses were destroyed. Although the mountain torrents have subsided, the Yellow River is still very turbulent. If the river rises again, the county seat will not be secure. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Personally Reports on the Disaster Situation in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zeng Yangfu visited Premier Wang on the afternoon of the 21st and reported in detail on the Zhejiang disaster. Zeng told people that of the 20 million yuan in public bonds issued this time, because Zhejiang's original funding was already stretched, it was decided to allocate 10 million yuan to the Finance Department for other purposes (such as repaying maturing provincial debts), and half of it would be used specifically for disaster relief. When he returned to Hangzhou from Nanjing last time, he set three principles for disaster relief: (1) Implement work relief to help extremely poor farmers affected by the disaster, estimated to be over 2 million yuan. The provincial government will purchase grain, and if it is insufficient, it will borrow US wheat from the Economic Commission. (2) Hold fair-price grain sales. First, the provincial government will investigate the amount of flour in the province, and then purchase foreign rice and transport it to Zhejiang for distribution. It is planned that the province will raise 1 million yuan and mortgage it to the bank. (3) Control food supplies. Zhejiang Province has a population of 21 million, with an average annual food consumption of 2.5 shi per person, requiring 52.5 million shi per year. Zhejiang has about 30 million mu of farmland, with an average yield of 1.2 shi per mu, only yielding 45 million shi. This year there is an even greater shortage, so control is being considered. In addition, raising silkworms in autumn is being promoted by the Construction Department, which can also solve the livelihoods of some farmers. If the public bond funds are insufficient, a request will be made for central government subsidies. (21st Dispatch) Large Number of Disaster Victims in Hubei</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>Public Concession Factory Inspection Problem Lingers</h3>
<p>The enactment of a national factory law directly improves the treatment of workers and resolves labor-management disputes. Indirectly, it develops the national economy and maintains social order. Its importance is self-evident. However, having a factory law without knowing the extent and scope of its implementation is equivalent to not having one. Therefore, after enacting factory laws, various countries also enact factory inspection laws to assess the implementation of the former laws. China's factory inspection law also emerged after the promulgation of the factory law. The responsible agency, the Ministry of Industry, adopted the recommendations of the International Labour Office experts, Mr. Pone and Mr. Anderson, and decided to gradually develop factory inspection in stages, with the aim of fully supervising the implementation of the factory law. In early April of this year, the Ministry of Industry approved the implementation procedures of the Central Factory Inspection Office, preparing to advance in five phases. According to investigations, there are already fourteen provinces and cities in the country that have completed the first phase of inspection work. However, the Shanghai concession area, which is the center of the country's factories, has not yet found a satisfactory solution to this problem, which is truly regrettable. Recently, the tragic accident of a boiler explosion at the Ta Yi Malt Extract Factory in the French Concession occurred. Mayor Wu specifically issued a statement (believing that anyone concerned about the industrial development of this city and sympathetic to the lives of laborers should undoubtedly recognize that factory inspection is an urgent and proactive task for this city). As a result, the residents of this city are paying close attention to the issue of factory inspection in the concessions. According to the reports of International Labour Office experts Mr. Pone and Mr. Anderson, when they visited various factories in Shanghai or contacted factory owner groups and individual factory owners, or spoke with leaders of worker groups in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), everyone told them that it was necessary to conduct factory inspections in Shanghai immediately. In November of the same year, the Vice Minister of Industry invited representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government and the two Concession authorities to an informal meeting to discuss a unified method for inspecting factories throughout Shanghai (including the two Concessions). At the meeting at that time, the representatives unanimously recognized two principles: (1) There should be only one set of labor regulations for all industrial areas in Shanghai. (2) The implementation of these regulations should be carried out by inspection personnel whose actions must be consistent and not differ from each other. During the second informal meeting, representatives from the three parties agreed on the following three points: (1) The Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession authorities agreed to employ factory inspectors trained and recommended by the Chinese government to inspect all factories within their respective boundaries. These inspectors would be supervised at any time by inspectors from the Central Inspection Office. (2) Factory inspectors in the Public Concession and French Concession should report the results and difficulties of their inspections to the Chinese government and the Public Concession and French Concession authorities on a regular basis. (3) All inspectors in the Shanghai Municipal Public Concession and French Concession should meet once a month to exchange opinions and discuss ways to remedy any deficiencies. If the concession authorities were willing to follow the above principles and the central implementation procedures, implementing them in stages, then factory inspection in Shanghai could proceed smoothly and shine brightly in the history of Chinese labor. Unexpectedly, the Board of Directors of the Public Concession believed that the previous resolution had not been formally approved and would rather go to the trouble of repeatedly convening special ratepayers' meetings to amend Article 34 of the Land Regulations' annex in order to obtain the necessary authority to order factories to obtain licenses. Only then would they prepare to establish an inspection agency within the Concession based on these restrictions in order to implement industrial regulations that apply equally to Chinese and foreign factories. In other words, the Board of Directors wanted to use the authority of the Municipal Council, rather than the authority of the Chinese central government, to proactively carry out factory inspection affairs within the Concession. They did not pay much attention to whether the special ratepayers' meeting had the authority to make such amendments to the annex to the Land Regulations or whether this would damage the unity of China's current regulations. Since May of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Council have repeatedly negotiated, and the two sides have largely agreed to organize a joint inspection office. However, disputes are still unavoidable. The focus of the dispute is on the issue of jurisdiction over the inspectors. Originally, although the Municipal Council agreed to employ factory inspectors recommended by the Chinese government, it insisted that the authority to supervise the inspectors should be entirely in the hands of the Bureau, fearing that government offices outside the Bureau would exercise their functions within the Concession and affect its position. The Municipal Government, on the other hand, advocated that both sides form a committee with an equal number of members, who would be responsible for supervising the inspectors. However, the Municipal Council has consistently refused to agree to this point, making it impossible for negotiations to proceed. We still hope that the Municipal Council will change its attitude one day. Because, firstly, when the Chinese government announced the implementation of the Factory Law, the Municipal Council issued a formal declaration expressing its agreement in principle. The Bureau's past position should not be abandoned casually. Secondly, factory inspection is to assess the implementation of the Factory Law. The Municipal Council has also acknowledged that it will strive to implement the basic principles of China's current Factory Inspection Law uniformly and effectively within the Concession to the extent possible. This point was announced by the Bureau itself and should not be suddenly overturned. Now that the dispute is only over the issue of jurisdiction mentioned above, we want to ask if this is worth arguing over or should be argued over. Unfortunately, the Municipal Council actually believes that (there is a fundamental difficulty in this matter that may not be resolved, namely, the Chinese side insists on sovereignty, while the Bureau wants to maintain the integrity of all administrative powers within the Public Concession.) (See page 21 of the Bureau's 1933 report.) In these few dozen words, it is clear that the Municipal Council very firmly regards China as the opposing party, as if it were an independent entity with no relationship to China, and completely forgets that it is a municipal administrative agency maintained by an absolute majority of Chinese taxpayers in the Concession. Speaking from the position of a taxpayer, we feel that this is not the attitude we expect from the Bureau. The Concession is Chinese territory, which the Bureau certainly knows and does not need to be explained further. In addition, we also remember that in the second article of the resolution of the 1864 Beijing Legation Conference on Shanghai Municipality, it was also said that any territorial rights that the Shanghai Concession may obtain (must not extend beyond the scope of municipal affairs, roads, police, and municipal taxes). Although the Municipal Council's regulations have been repeatedly amended since then, there is no doubt that its powers, in any case, cannot exceed the above principles. Now, the matter of factory inspection clearly relates to the national labor administration and can never be regarded as something that any municipal agency can proactively initiate. At the very least, the Municipal Council should not overstep its bounds and acquire the power of the Chinese government to inspect Chinese factories within the Concession. We believe that the Municipal Council's jurisdiction over factory inspection is not something that should be disputed in terms of the nature of the event and its own powers. Having already acknowledged that it will cooperate effectively with the Chinese authorities to the extent possible to implement the basic principles of the Chinese Factory Inspection Law, it is still preoccupied with the gains and losses of some jurisdiction, making cooperation a dead letter. This is truly sacrificing the fundamental for the trivial and is therefore not worth arguing over. US Army Air Corps</p>

<p>(Washington) The U.S. Army Air Corps' grandest formation flight was completed today. Ten Martin-type heavy bombers flew back from Alaska this afternoon and landed at Bolling Field here. The Air Corps took off from here on July 19, delayed by two weeks from the scheduled date due to labor strikes along the Pacific coast. The entire team arrived in Alaska on July 25, a total distance of 4,000 miles. At the same time, Navy aircraft also flew in formation to Dutch Harbor in Alaska, attracting much attention because of widespread speculation that the United States would establish an air force base in the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Islands are only 700 miles from the Asian continent, so some believe that the United States intends to use this to counter Japan's naval equality demands. However, if war breaks out in the Pacific, the US Air Force must pass through Canada to fly to Alaska, which is also a problem. Now that the power of the aircraft has been tested, there are still 800 miles of Canadian territory separating Alaska from the US mainland. Without special understanding, everything will be obstructed. Even the waterway used by naval aircraft is too close to the Canadian border, which cannot be successful without an agreement. However, if war breaks out, Canada's allowing multiple aircraft to pass through would violate its neutrality. Military experts believe that Canada does not have a strong navy for self-defense, so for the sake of its own interests, it must unite with the United States. Moreover, its commercial, political, and even social situation are the same as those of the United States. If it encounters difficulties, it will suffer equally. Some experts believe that the current US-Canada aviation treaty, which mutually allows commercial aircraft to pass through, may eventually lead to a military treaty.

<h3>British-Japanese Political Agreement</h3>
<p>British Policy Towards the Far East</p>
<p>Is to Prevent the Reddening of India</p>
<p>(London) Several foreign newspapers have reported that Britain and Japan will reach a diplomatic settlement or conclude a treaty. The main purpose is to establish a demilitarized zone south of the Philippines, and the two countries will divide spheres of influence in Asia. Britain will act freely in Central Asia, while Japan will act freely in northern China. Some say that this news was spread by a German reporter, while others say it was spread by Russians. British officials have formally denied it. A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo said that the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman has also denied it. London sources say that the content of this alleged settlement is completely contrary to British policy towards Asia. Britain's policy is to consolidate China's power in Tibet and Xinjiang to prevent these two places from becoming a front for communist propaganda to enter India. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Ministry officials denied having received the proposal regarding a new British-Japanese agreement, saying the following: (1) The revival of the British-Japanese alliance is indeed a fact. Therefore, depending on the outcome of the disarmament conference, it may be officially considered a political agreement. (2) However, even if proposed by Britain now, it cannot be agreed to without considering the opinions of the United States. Japan naturally believes that a political agreement should be concluded by Britain, Japan, and the United States to seek ways to ensure world peace. (21st Electric Communication Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Envoys from various countries to Japan and foreign reporters have returned to Tokyo from their summer retreats due to the recent rumors of a British-Japanese economic partnership. The main points of the new agreement, which were spread by Dutch East Indies reporter Havice, are as follows: (1) Respect the British and Japanese interests in Central Asia and East Asia. (1) Britain recognizes Japan's free actions in Manchuria and North China, while in South China, Britain adopts a cooperative attitude. (1) Japan promises not to invade British India and the Malay Peninsula. (1) In East Asia, Japan, and in Central Asia, Britain, will maintain benevolent neutrality if there is a conflict with Soviet Russia. It is said to be heard from reliable sources that the reason is that the British have been at a disadvantage in the 13 years since the abolition of the British-Japanese alliance, and the British Conservative Party believes that the best policy to compete with Japanese goods is to restore friendly relations between Britain and Japan, and that the United States is also withdrawing from the Philippines, etc. However, the Foreign Ministry does not acknowledge this, saying that no political negotiations have been conducted between Britain and Japan, and that the visit of the British economic delegation to Manchuria is probably without political meaning. (21st Electric Communication Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) American sources believe that the rumor of a British-Japanese alliance is not true, but they believe that talks have indeed been held between the two countries in the hope of reaching an oral agreement on various issues in the Far East. Reliable sources say that the British Embassy in Japan recently discussed the oil issue with the Japanese government. It is reported that the British industrial survey mission to Manchuria is focusing on the oil issue. According to personnel at the British Embassy in Tokyo, British Ambassador Clive has not held any political talks with Foreign Minister Hirota regarding general relations between Britain and Japan.

<h3>Japan Also Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Whether the Outcome is Unfortunate</p>
<p>Can Only Await Factual Proof</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today issued a long statement of 1,200 words, detailing the progress of the negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway. It stated that on June 26, 1933, the price of the railway was set at 250 million gold rubles, which was gradually reduced by Soviet Russia to 160 million Japanese yen on July 30. At the same time, Manchuria initially offered 50 million Japanese yen, which was gradually increased to 120 million Japanese yen on July 23, plus 30 million yen for the severance pay of Soviet Russian employees. The price proposed by Soviet Russia on July 30 was attached with new conditions, including a gold bar clause and a suggestion regarding the payment of part of the purchase price in goods. These conditions would indefinitely prolong the railway transfer negotiations. Soviet Russian Ambassador to Tokyo, Yulenev, even said that if a higher price was not given, Soviet Russia had no intention of negotiating directly with Manchuria. Furthermore, although the Japanese government clearly expressed its sincerity, the Soviet Russian government still regarded the final proposal of the Japanese Ambassador to Moscow as similar to an ultimatum. In fact, the Ambassador was only mediating. As for the arrest of Soviet Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it was purely a judicial matter, but Soviet Russia used this to spread rumors and combine this matter with the suspension of the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations. In fact, the two matters are not related. If the true will of Soviet Russia is to prolong the negotiations in order to trap Japan in international disputes, then the Japanese government's sincere and resolute work will be in vain, and the overall situation will become truly very serious. This will be witnessed by all. However, Japan still hopes for an appropriate and satisfactory resolution, so as to eliminate the various causes of possible conflict and benefit the peaceful development of relations between Japan, Manchuria, and Soviet Russia.

<h3>Russian Railway Employees Continue to Be Arrested</h3>
<p>Reports from Bo Li and Harbin say that Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway continue to be arrested. On August 18, Austaningsu Chinzi, the head of the freight department at the Yimianpo Station, Sukolov, the accountant of the Chinese Eastern Railway Commercial Office in the region, and Mikhailov, the stationmaster of the Taipingling Station, were all arrested by the police.

<h3>Report on Japanese-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The regular Cabinet meeting today began at 10:30 AM. Minister of the Army Lin said that accidents have been occurring frequently on the recent Manchurian-Soviet border, and the situation is worrying. A strategy to resolve the situation must be sought. He then provided the following comprehensive report on the contents and state of the recent events:</p>
<p>A total of 24 accidents have occurred on the Soviet-Manchurian border in recent months. By region, the eastern border region accounted for 15, the Heilongjiang region for 5, and the western border region for 4. Although the contents of these events do not contain great importance, the frequent occurrence of problems, if continued, will have a bad impact on the relations between the two countries. Thinking quietly about this, I feel very troubled. Defense Minister Otagaki then discussed the following issues: Problems often occur on the Manchurian-Soviet border, which is truly difficult. Fortunately, the fishing area in the Garmakhaka region is more peaceful than in previous years.</p>
<p>After the Cabinet meeting, Minister of the Army Lin told people the following:</p>
<p>I reported on the Manchurian-Soviet border events today because of the frequent occurrence of events in that region recently. Therefore, I reported the contents to my colleagues for reference. As for what methods should be taken to deal with the situation, it was not discussed at the Cabinet meeting. The Ministry of the Army has not taken any active action on this fact. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have taken some action. (21st Japan United Press Telegram) Soviet Russia Joins</p>

<p>(Geneva) The International Labour Office received an important message today. Gier Bai, the US representative in Geneva, notified the Bureau that the International Labour Conference had previously invited the United States to join the International Labour Organization, and the US government has now decided to formally accept this invitation. Since the United States is one of the eight major industrial countries, now that it has joined the International Labour Organization, it has the right to occupy a permanent councilor seat in the ILO Governing Body.

<h3>European Arms Industry</h3>
<p>As Developed as During the War</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to reliable diplomatic sources, the business of European arms manufacturers has been very developed recently, almost as developed as during the war. Proponents of disarmament still want to conclude treaties and ban arms trafficking. Central Europe, the Far East, and South American countries have recently purchased huge amounts of war materials. The diplomatic community wants to stop the Chaco War and has proposed an arms embargo on Bolivia and Paraguay. However, Italian factories are still supplying Paraguay in an endless stream, and many fighter planes are being transported to Paraguay. The factory also supplies Italy and Austria at the same time. The National News claims that since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austria signed a commercial agreement, arms transportation has greatly improved, especially during the period from May 24 to June 2. The newspaper also claims that gun parts have been transported to a canning factory in Hungary disguised as fresh fruits and vegetables. It is said that French factories are also working day and night, with huge supplies to the Far East and South America. Therefore, the efforts of the League of Nations have had no practical effect. A certain French factory is also in contact with Turkey. If the countries that signed the Lausanne Treaty allow it to fortify the Dardanelles Strait, the factory can supply all military equipment. According to news from the Balkan Peninsula, the British Vickers factory is in contact with the Romanian government to develop the Romanian arms industry. If the contact is successful, the factory can also receive a large number of orders. In addition, aircraft manufacturing plants are also very busy. British manufacturers are selling motor parts to Germany. Russia will also send personnel to the UK to inspect British fighter planes for purchase.

<h3>Meeting at Florence</h3>
<p>Discussing the Guarantee of Austrian Independence　　Military Treaty Appears Equal on the Surface　　Italy Acknowledges Restoration of Austrian Monarchy Not Yet Timely　　Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with German Chancellor Hitler in Venice less than two months ago. Now, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and the Italian Prime Minister have reconvened in Florence today. The Italian Prime Minister, while inspecting troops in the mountains, heard of the Austrian Chancellor's arrival and sped over by car. On the reviewing stand, Blackshirts and Black Hat Boy Scouts were lined up to welcome the two dignitaries. Schuschnigg appeared pale, wearing grey clothes and a light blue hat. As he shook hands with the Italian Prime Minister, the military band on the reviewing stand played the Austrian national anthem. The two Prime Ministers then traveled by car to the village of Marignolle outside Florence to discuss the guarantee of Austrian independence and the possibility of Italy providing financial assistance to Austria. (Reuter's dispatch, 21st) 　　The Austrian Chancellor told reporters in Florence, "Our meeting is not at all surprising. We merely wish to discuss Italian-Austrian relations and the Danube River issue to seek economic cooperation between the two countries." However, observers generally believe this discussion includes many important issues, possibly discussing increasing and reorganizing the Austrian army to safeguard Austria's independence, as well as Prime Minister Mussolini's attitude towards the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. It is also reported that Austria plans to apply to the League of Nations in mid-September to increase its standing army, which is currently restricted by the Treaty of Saint-Germain, in preparation for German invasion or the National Socialist Party instigating unrest within Austria. The Austrian Chancellor's visit is one of the invitations extended by Mussolini to European politicians to come to Italy to discuss political and economic issues. Others who have been invited to conferences in Italy include Hitler, Dollfuss, and Starhemberg. (National Telegram, 21st) 　　A special correspondent from the Paris newspaper "Le Matin" wired from Florence today, stating that a permanent military treaty between Italy and Austria will be the focus of today's talks between Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. The treaty may take the form of a mutual aid pact. While the two countries will appear to be on equal footing in the treaty, respecting Austria's sovereignty, it is recognized that Italian military intervention is legitimate. (National Telegram, 21st) 　　The "Daily Express" of London, in its criticism of the meeting between Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg today, stated that the Austrian Chancellor is going to Italy to receive instructions from Mussolini. The newspaper further stated that the most pitiful thing is when a government daily slaughters to maintain its regime, but even more pitiful is when a country's leader must personally go to a foreign country to seek instructions. (National Telegram, 21st) 　　Political talks between Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg in Florence, Italy, began this morning. In the afternoon, the two leaders will tour the nearby town of San Gimignano and continue their talks. Although the meeting is unlikely to produce unexpected results, its value lies in a political demonstration. Since the Austrian coup d'état on July 25th, Italy has deployed troops to the border to assist Austrian independence. Currently, the National Socialist Party's hostile actions towards Austria have temporarily ceased, and the meeting between the Italian and Austrian leaders at this time is of political significance that Germany cannot ignore. In fact, the National Socialist Party is not in a hurry to prove that it is willing to end its anti-Austrian actions. Yesterday, the Austrian military court sentenced two National Socialists who were storing explosives to death, and President Miklas refused to grant them amnesty, which is intended to warn National Socialists. In short, the current situation can be described as France, Britain, and Italy all wanting Germany to clearly express its peaceful intentions. Britain and France want Germany to return to Geneva and participate in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, while Italy wants Germany to strive to assist the independent economic recovery of Austria based on the Rome Protocols (i.e., the protocols signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Rome on March 18 of this year, divided into economic and political aspects). (Havas Dispatch, 21st) 　　(London) According to the "Daily Telegraph", Duke of Hohenberg seems to have met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for a short time. The Italian Prime Minister neither expressed support for the annexation of Austria and Hungary under the rule of the Duke of Hohenberg, nor declared opposition. He stated that the issue of restoration is not yet to be discussed, and once the situation in Austria improves, its advantages and disadvantages will be considered.

<h3>Hitler's Dissatisfaction with the United States and China</h3>
<p>Publishes a Letter to the People Expressing Gratitude for Their Support　　Striving to Convert Opponents to the Swastika Banner　　(Berlin) After the German people completed voting, Hitler immediately issued the following declaration to the entire nation: "The struggle of the National Socialist movement for fifteen years has finally come to an end last night. From the highest government bodies to the most remote and smallest villages, everything today is in the hands of the National Socialist Party. This is the reward for immeasurable effort and countless sacrifices. Now, the entire nation has used the opportunity to vote to show the unity of Germany to the world. I respectfully thank you. From now on, how to make this unity even stronger, how to work even more resolutely to bring even the last member of the nation under the teachings of National Socialism, this is the work of me and my colleagues. The plan for how to carry out this work has already been completed today, and it will be implemented with the consistent perseverance and speed that is characteristic of National Socialism. The era of fighting for national power has passed, but the struggle for the welfare of the people is still as it was in the past. The goal is set, and it will never change. The day to reach the goal will eventually come, and at that time, even the last member of the German people will embrace National Socialism," and so on. (National Telegram, 20th) 　　(Berlin) After the voting ended, Hitler re-published a second declaration as a conclusion to the voting, saying, "Yesterday's glorious victory of the National Socialist Party was created by your unanimous and unwavering support and spirit of sacrifice. You, as political soldiers, as stormtroopers, as brownshirts, as workers, as youth and women's organizations, have all fulfilled your unprecedented duty. I deeply believe in your loyalty, and that the party will be revitalized again to fight for the soul and unity of the German nation. Only in this new struggle should you be my loyal guards, as inseparable and unwavering as you have been for fifteen years. Since the sincerity of ninety percent of the German people has been obtained, it should not be difficult to further persuade the remaining ten percent. When this is accomplished one day, it will be the day of crowning victory." (National Telegram, 20th) 　　(Berlin) Following the recent referendum results, where one-tenth of voters expressed opposition, Hitler (Leader and Chancellor) published a letter to the people stating that the government will begin new actions to ensure that these individuals change their views and embrace National Socialism. Today, all newspapers prominently published this letter without criticism. Only the "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" expressed its thoughts, saying, "Now that Hitler holds great power, he could have severely punished these opponents without any leniency. However, he did not do so, which proves Hitler's intention to fulfill the last wishes of the late President Hindenburg regarding military and political affairs." (Note: Hindenburg's political will regarding military and political affairs was about obeying the highest authority, abandoning grievances, cooperating harmoniously, and jointly planning national affairs.) Therefore, what Hitler wants to achieve is the spirit of harmony that the late President repeatedly warned about in his will." Other newspapers are mutually rejoicing in the perfection of the voting results, saying that there has never been a country like Germany where the people eagerly participated in something that concerns the fate of the nation. The "Völkischer Beobachter" said, "Looking around the world, whether it's a president or a monarch, who has been able to obtain the support of the people as much as Hitler?" "Germania" compared the results of this vote with the achievements of Roosevelt's election as President of the United States in November of the previous year, saying, "At that time, Roosevelt claimed to represent a total of 12.2 million Americans, but he only received 20 million votes, which is only 17 percent of the total population. As for Hitler, he represents 60 percent of the entire German population, which is a far cry." (Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Analysis and Research of Vote Counts in Various Regions</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to the overall results of the referendum, nine out of every ten people supported Hitler, and one person opposed him. However, this cannot accurately represent the actual proportion of those satisfied with the current system and those who resent it. Some say that if this vote had been conducted in the same way as the 1930 parliamentary elections, with freedom and competition, Hitler would only have been able to get one-third of the national vote, which is the same as the result of competing with Hindenburg for the presidency in 1932. We cannot draw this conclusion from the revealed vote count, but the number of people who openly expressed their opposition is undeniable. Moreover, before the election, the National Socialists made great efforts in propaganda and persuasion. Propaganda Minister Goebbels said before the vote that all German people should unite as one and vote in favor. Unexpectedly, there were so many opponents. In large cities, the population is dense, and people do not know each other as much as villagers do in rural areas. Therefore, the freedom to vote in large cities is greater than in poor rural areas. By comparing the details of the voting, we can get meaningful information. Therefore, the newspapers do not record the details of the voting, which is undoubtedly due to instructions from above. It is quite interesting to study the ratio of supporters and opponents in some places. (1) In Birmasens, after the French troops withdrew from there in 1930, several Germans who expressed sympathy with the French were burned to death. National Socialist propaganda was most effective here. The voting results showed that for every 233 people who supported him, only one person opposed him. (2) In Kaiserslautern, only one vote opposed for every forty votes in favor. (3) In the large industrial city of Essen, there was one person opposed for every twenty people in favor. (4) In Duisburg, there was one person opposed for every seventeen people in favor. (5) In other cities in the same industrial area, the ratio of supporters to opponents was five to one. (6) In most large cities, most were five people in favor to one person opposed, such as Magdeburg in central Germany, Recklinghausen, Gelsenkirchen in Westphalia, and Trèves, Mainz, Cologne, Koblenz, and Hanover and Berlin in the Rhine area. (7) In addition to the aforementioned places, there were more opposition votes in other places. For example, in Aix-la-Chapelle, for every twenty-five people in favor, ten people opposed. In Hamburg, for every thirty-six people in favor, ten people opposed. In Bonn, Kalm, and Rhine, 49,487 people supported, and 11,700 people opposed. This is a rough analysis and study of the vote counts in various regions. From these detailed circumstances, we can see that those who are dissatisfied with Hitler in Germany, in places where they can express it, do not hesitate to express it. If we only look at the total number of votes, we cannot see this meaning. The aforementioned situation is most evident in three types of places: (1) the cities along the Rhine River where the Catholic Church is influential; (2) the industrial cities in central Germany; and (3) the cities where the petty bourgeoisie is in power. In conclusion, we can see from this vote that all those in Germany who oppose Hitler have the courage to express their opinions, and they believe that expressing their opinions is beneficial.

<h3>French Newspapers Worry About the Future of the European Situation</h3>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers have not dared to ignore the results of the German referendum. On the contrary, the fact that the German people voted in favor of Hitler by an overwhelming majority has been closely watched by all newspapers. At the same time, all newspapers believe that Hitlerism is increasingly leaning to the right and will tend towards complete nationalism. There is no room for doubt. "Paris Echo" said, "Now that Hitler has ascended to a high position, the danger in Europe is becoming more and more serious. At least Hitler will continue the policy of rearming Germany without stopping." "Le Journal" said, "Hitler is none other than a giant made of clay feet and standing on a fragile foundation." "Le Petit Parisien" said, "Hitler wants to make the five million Germans who cast opposition votes feel converted to the banner of the National Socialist Party. This intention is inspired by the fanatical missionary spirit of the old era. From this, we can see the vigor of the National Socialist leaders and foreshadow the coming of an era of vendetta against dissidents." "Le Journal des débats" also expressed the same opinion, believing that "Hitler has won a victory, but he is still sullen and dissatisfied. He will indulge in killing dissidents within Germany to calm his anger, but the internal vendetta is only the beginning of his atrocities." (Havas Dispatch, 21st) Japan cannot wait</p>

<h3>Comment on China's Silver Policy</h3>
<p>US Treasury Continues to Purchase Silver　　(London) The "Financial News" criticized China's decision not to ban silver exports today, saying that the Chinese government may not try to support the US plan to raise world silver prices. If the Chinese authorities do not stop the outflow of silver from China, it will satisfy US demand before China's silver reserves are exhausted, and China can also take in sufficient gold to switch to the gold standard, thus avoiding the adverse effects of rising prices and trade in China. Therefore, China has various reasons to allow silver exports. (Reuter's Dispatch, 21st) 　　(Washington) Government authorities today denied the claim that the United States will reset the silver price to US$2.18 per ounce to make the gold-silver ratio sixteen to one. Those close to the White House said that the current silver price is US$1.29 per ounce and is unlikely to change. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced this afternoon that the Treasury Department has taken in 33,465,000 ounces of silver since the Silver Nationalization Act, and also said that the Treasury Department has purchased 11,321,000 ounces of raw silver at a price of 64.5 cents.

<h3>Discovers Revolutionary Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Six Military Officers Arrested　　A political conspiracy to overthrow the current government and establish General Plastiras, organize a military cabinet, and establish a dictatorship has been uncovered here in Athens. Several military officers have been arrested on charges of participating in the conspiracy. According to reports, General Plastiras planned to launch a coup d'état after the Greek parliamentary elections in March of last year to establish a military government. After the failure of the event, he fled. The general public expects that the nature of this conspiracy is not very important. (Havas Dispatch, 21st) 　　The Avala News Agency of the Yugoslav capital released the following message regarding the situation of the conspiracy case uncovered in Greece, saying that "Army Major Pangalos and Captains Goussiredinos proposed that several military officers sign a covenant to cooperate and overthrow the current government, and were particularly focused on overthrowing the current Army Minister General Kondylis. Goussiredinos informed the Army Minister, and Chavas and five military officers were arrested for trial. A copy of the covenant was found in the home of the arrested military officer Belumidis, and its contents also included the following provisions: (1) The establishment of a military conference, organized by ten people; (2) After the new government is formed, the army will be reorganized based on democracy." It is rumored that the scope of the conspiracy is quite broad, and several civilian officials are also involved. The preliminary hearing is currently being presided over by Army Minister Kondylis himself. Opposition parties have expressed doubts about the conspiracy case, believing that the case is not very serious and that the government is exaggerating it. (Havas Dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Smuggling Case Exposed</h3>
<p>Police Officers and Tax Officials Are Colluding, Smuggling Goods Worth Millions</p>
<p>An Osaka Asahi Shimbun Fengtian [Mukden] special dispatch on the 17th stated that a smuggling organization has been established, centered on the commercial association of Wafangdian and Pulandian on the border between the Kwantung Leased Territory and outside the territory. The organization has been colluding with drivers, waiters, and others of the South Manchuria Railway to secretly transport large quantities of goods. The smuggling has been going on for a long time, and the Kwantung Leased Territory police officers and customs officials responsible for cracking down on smuggling, as well as the anti-smuggling teams and border police of Manchuria [Manchukuo], are suspected of accepting bribes. The Yingkou [Newchwang] military police are currently leading an investigation, and as of the 17th, more than 50 smugglers, customs officials, and other suspects have been arrested, drawing widespread attention. It is reported that the case began after a train accident occurred between Wafangdian and Pulandian on July 12. The Wafangdian garrison forces increased security, and on the night of the 20th, they arrested individuals pouring oil on the tracks near a farmhouse between Wafangdian and Pulandian. These individuals were originally smugglers who planned to slow down the train so they could throw goods out of the train and have them picked up. However, because the Kwantung Leased Territory authorities were implicated in the case, the garrison forces handed it over to the Yingkou military police. The Yingkou consul and the Dalian military police mobilized their forces and made the arrests. According to smugglers, they have been colluding with Kwantung Leased Territory police officers, anti-smuggling teams, and border police to smuggle opium, military equipment, and other goods worth millions of yuan. The fact that such a corrupt incident has occurred in the Kwantung Leased Territory is unprecedented. The embassy in Manchuria [Manchukuo] has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the Minister of Justice appoint a senior official to handle the matter, causing great embarrassment to the Kwantung Leased Territory authorities.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union's Farmers Conquer the Drought Demon (Moscow Correspondence) Translated by Yuan</h3>
<p>One of the most significant events in the history of Soviet agriculture this past quarter was the collective farm farmers' victory over the severe drought that ravaged almost the entire Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>While American farms are facing the worst harvest in nearly forty years, allocating their national budget to deal with the League's famine relief efforts, while Canada is experiencing an unprecedented drought and is unable to provide relief, while all of Europe, from the southern plains of Romania to the evergreen fields of England, is scorched by flames, the farmers of the Soviet collective farms have begun to declare war on the drought demon and have finally been able to repel its extreme heat. According to people from southern Russia, although some areas have suffered, on the whole, this year's harvest may be the same as usual, or even exceed it.</p>
<p>The main reason for this result is due to the farmers' organized struggle, which was conducted under the leadership of a nationwide movement, with extensive publicity from local land departments and central and local newspapers.</p>
<h3>A Multifaceted Movement</h3>
<p>This is a multifaceted movement. The first step is to utilize science to contribute to the drought resistance issue. In order to use scientific contributions, there is extensive collective activity. The second step is to complete the plowing and early sowing of ten million acres this spring (this batch of sowing obtained sufficient water from melting snow), and to sow 2.5 million acres of (germinating seeds) (this is a method promoted by the Soviet Union in recent years, the moisture obtained from this batch of seeds is greater than that of early sowing). But these are all standard practices for harvest insurance, which are often implemented in southern and southeastern Soviet Union. When the Soviet drought demon became severe, a special movement began. Its location is in the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Oblast. These places, which were previously regarded as incapable nations, are now recognized as the most well-organized among nations because of this movement and have been awarded the Order of Lenin.</p>

<p>The status of the above-mentioned area is on the northeastern slope of the Caucasus Mountains, right in the center of the driest area. However, there are also many mountain springs that irrigate it. At a conference convened in its capital, elderly farmers and Udarniks (shock workers) passed a resolution to adopt special irrigation methods, using cooperative forces to utilize mountain rapids. Within three days, dozens of kilometers of irrigation ditches were dug in Kabardino-Balkaria. These farmers also have a slogan: "Our harvest does not rely on rain." News has come from various southern grain-growing areas that there is a similar drought resistance movement there. Thermal Petrovsk is one of the most effective places. At the collective farm farmers' meeting before the harvest, it was resolved to adopt special drought resistance methods, including the following: (1) When plowing, pay attention to preserving soil moisture; (2) When sowing fields, every weed must be removed by the roots; (3) Late-season grains should be planted in low-lying areas or forest clearings, in order to replant on land where winter wheat fields have been damaged by drought; (4) All places that can be irrigated, such as the Thermal River basin and other gardens, should be irrigated under organized action.</p>
<p>In many parts of the Saratov and Stalingrad Oblasts, methods were found to implement irrigation from many ponds or streams. Areas that are usually barren, such as ponds and lakes, have been planted this year. Seeds were also sown on the soil in places with shallow water. Another equally important method is to immediately replow the fields where winter wheat has withered due to the prolonged drought. Central agricultural newspapers have published many scientific articles that accurately instruct replanting methods to suit various localities. It has now been proven that in the distant south, a second crop of millet can be harvested on fields that have yielded wheat and winter wheat. The same bumper millet harvest has been achieved in northern Ukraine, and they also plan to plant other grains.</p>
<h3>Results of Resowing</h3>
<p>According to reports from local areas regarding the results of the Ministry of Agriculture's sowing plan, the spring sowing in Crimea has exceeded its target by 10%. The majority of this is additional sowing, done to compensate for losses caused by drought. The dry months of April and May, followed by a wet June, have become almost commonplace. This year is no exception. The second sowing can obtain ample moisture. The report from Crimea indicates that even in areas where it did not rain for an entire season, farms that adhered to proper agricultural practices have achieved harvests. The nationwide planned collectivization method has allowed Soviet farmers to overcome drought. Furthermore, recent news from the Artificial Rain Research Institute in Turkmenia states that the Soviet Union will soon invent a method for managing rainfall to create even more rain. This institute is located in the driest area of the Soviet Union, in Ashgabat, surrounded by the hot sands of Turkmenia. This spring, the institute conducted numerous experiments with good results, effective not only in dense clouds but also in so-called "layered clouds" containing minimal rainfall. According to observers on the ground, within five to seven minutes after an aircraft passed, a faint white line appeared in the clouds. This line disappeared as the entire cloud turned snow-white, and a dark rain belt suddenly appeared below the cloud. Initially, the raindrops were small and contained chemical properties, but in an instant, raindrops fell like normal rain. At this point, the clouds dispersed.</p>
<h3>An Experience in Rainmaking</h3>
<p>In a recent article in (Pravda), a pilot described his experience making rain: (I flew through the clouds from all directions. The sky was calm, and there was no moisture on the wings or nose of my plane. I sprinkled the chemical mixture on the clouds and then flew in circles beneath them. The rain began to fall. I flew into the clouds again, and it was raining there too. The plane immediately became wet, and there was a sharp sound around the plane, like thunder.) Despite the aircraft chasing layered clouds in turns, the clouds all turned to rain during the plane’s round trips. In 66% of cases, the rain fell as a sudden shower. In 34% of cases, the rain was scattered by the wind until it evaporated and rose again. If these experiments encounter rain clouds, 90% of the clouds will immediately precipitate as heavy rain.</p>
<h3>Artificial Fog</h3>
<p>This institute is not satisfied with just making rain; on the contrary, it is continuing to advance. On a clear day in May, artificial fog was created in the city of Ashgabat, making it impossible to see more than a few steps away for four days. This artificial fog possessed all the qualities of natural fog, containing moisture. It was created by burning certain chemicals that can precipitate moisture from the air. Even on the hottest and driest days, there is always ample moisture in the atmosphere. By simply precipitating it, one can obtain ten to twenty "hao" (a small unit of measurement) of rainfall. The institute’s second step (currently under research) is to create clouds in broad daylight using the method of creating fog, and then cause these artificial clouds to precipitate as rain. Undoubtedly, they will have good results to report by the end of this season. The scientific management (or control) of rain is clearly one of the advancements demanded by socialist society to optimize its development. However, if the capitalist world were also to implement artificial rain, problems would arise. Disputes would occur between the areas receiving rain and the areas over which the clouds are floating, a contradictory phenomenon inherent to the nature of capitalism. Ji Nan</p>
<h3>The Flow of Water from the Breached Dike Will Stop</h3>
<p>Even If It Flows into Shandong Province, It Will Not Cause Harm Jinan Correspondence: This time, the breach in the Yellow River in Changyuan has multiple openings. However, because the terrain behind the river is too high, the discharged water is not very strong and flows eastward slowly. Therefore, from the time of the breach on the 12th to the present, it has barely passed through Hua County and Puyang. According to a report received by the River Affairs Bureau on the 19th, the four openings at Dongzhai, Xiangli, Zhang Jiugu, and Menggang in Changyuan are about 100 meters long and wide. Except for a slight trickle at Dongzhai, the other three openings have stopped flowing. The water depth is no more than seven or eight centimeters, so there is nothing to worry about. According to Qi Shou'an, a member of the Shandong Provincial Defense Committee stationed by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the silt deposited after last year's breach in Changyuan is very high. Therefore, the river water discharged in this year's breach is not strong due to the high terrain, and the water head is only a few inches, flowing eastward very slowly. Furthermore, today (20th), I also received a report from Hebei stating that only Dongzhai still has a trickle of water flowing from each opening, while most of the other openings have dried up. The Hebei River Affairs Bureau is blocking the openings in a timely manner, with half the effort yielding twice the results. The source of the discharged water will be cut off. Even if it flows into Shandong province, it will not cause harm. Considering the time, we are now past seven or eight tenths of the major flood season of August 20th. If there are no accidents, this province can be safe and sound. Zhang Guozhong, the magistrate of Puyang County, reported to the provincial government, stating: (According to reports, the openings breached in Changyuan, at Menggangji, have been completely blocked, and the remaining openings are in the process of being blocked. The water head has reached the border of Puyang County, and the water flow is very slow. The water level in the Liuyuan River in the county has dropped more than two centimeters from last night to today. Details will be reported later. Respectfully, Zhang Guozhong, Magistrate of Puyang County.) Also, Zhang Zhixi, the magistrate of Dongping County, reported, stating: (The water level of the Yellow River in my county has dropped another two centimeters today. The various dangerous sections have been completely repaired, and the stone and hemp bags are sufficient for use. The construction of the moon dike can also be completed tomorrow. There is currently no danger at all. Please rest assured. Zhang Zhixi, Magistrate of Dongping County, respectfully.) (20th)</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Soar, Food Supply Causes Concern Huizhou Correspondence: This summer, there has been no rain during the plum season, and all counties are suffering from drought. Since the yellow plum season to the new autumn, there has been no rainfall in the Huizhou region. Water sources have dried up, rivers are becoming shallower daily, seedlings are withered and curled, and the fields are covered in white dust. The severity and extent of the disaster are unseen in the seventy years since the Taiping Rebellion. Although farmers have exhausted their resources praying for rain, the scorching sun continues unabated. The authorities' various drought prevention plans have also proven ineffective. In addition, locusts, nymphs, and epidemics have arisen in various counties. The Huizhou region has always struggled to be self-sufficient in rice. Now, in this time between crops, the people have little stored grain, causing rice prices to skyrocket, making it difficult for the poor to obtain a full meal. The future of the people's food supply is of great concern. The following is a summary of the disaster situation in various counties, outlining the severity of the disaster: (1) She County: The areas most affected by the drought in She County are the Xinshi and Mingnong townships in the west of the county. Upland fields have become dry land, and ponds and pools have dried up, making drinking water scarce. The early rice harvest has turned into empty husks. The area where no autumn harvest is expected in the eastern township is about 30,000 mu, and the number of farmers lacking food and clothing is about 3,000. Locusts have been found in the Songkou area of the second district, causing considerable damage. The insect infestation is also spreading to villages in the eastern township. At the end of last month, hailstorms suddenly occurred in areas such as Xinying and Taihekeng, causing significant damage to crops. (2) Xiuning: Xiuning County has not had rain for two months, and the signs of disaster have long been evident. The highlands, which lack water conservation facilities, are particularly affected. Farmers have exhausted their money, energy, and sweat, and now their harvest is hopeless. Recently, some have even become mentally deranged, and cries can be heard throughout the fields. Farmers from various townships have been going to Baiyue Mountain in groups to pray for rain almost every day. The price of rice in Xiucheng and Tunxi has risen to eleven yuan per stone and continues to rise. (3) Wuyuan: In Wuyuan County, early rice accounts for 30% of the crops, and late rice accounts for 70%. According to statistics on the early rice harvest in the four townships, fields with water retention still have 30-40% of the harvest, while fields that dried up early have no harvest at all. If there is no rain in the next ten days, the autumn harvest will also be hopeless. Farmers have exhausted all methods of praying for rain, and the tragic situation is indescribable. In the bandit-affected areas in the southwest, the price of rice is five "yang" per "sheng," and there is still nowhere to buy it. The price in the county seat and the northeastern townships has also risen to eleven yuan, and the county government has established a drought prevention committee to actively plan relief work to help the disaster victims. (4) Qimen: Qimen County has been in a prolonged drought, making it impossible to sow late grains. The rice in the high fields can be burned with fire, and half of the rice in the low fields has no harvest. Recently, pests have also spread, breaking the rice stalks. Other dryland crops have also curled up into strands, making it difficult to expect a harvest. Yesterday, the people of all twenty-two "du" in the county held a general prayer in the city. In the Shanli area west of Qimen, which has been recently disturbed by bandits, the stored grain has been robbed, and the price of rice has soared to twenty yuan per stone, causing many poor households to worry about food shortages. (5) Yi County: The drought in Yi County is also severe. Farmers from the four townships pray for rain dozens of times a day. Recently, the sky has been clear and cloudless, and the heat is particularly intense. The well water in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth "du" has dried up, causing problems with the residents' daily drinking water. Recently, there have been many cases of cholera in the city area, with deaths occurring one after another. Because there is no grain being imported from neighboring counties, the price has risen to thirteen yuan per stone. Magistrate Zhuang has sent a telegram to the Taiping County government, requesting that the ban on rice be lifted to maintain the people's food supply. (6) Jixi: The drought in Jixi County is most severe in the second and third districts. The rice fields have not seen a drop of rain in two months, and the seedlings have withered. Even the waterlogged fields have cracks. One-third of the rice cannot be saved. An epidemic has suddenly broken out in the Xuechuan area of the fourth district and is spreading rapidly. The county's agricultural cooperative has purchased water pumps to transport water to Jixi and has issued special regulations to begin irrigating the fields to save the withering rice ears. (16th) Two More Public Associations in Songjiang</p>
<h3>Request Investigation into the Corruption Case of Land Tax</h3>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: Public associations in Songjiang have repeatedly telegraphed requests for an investigation into the corruption case involving the manipulation of grain transport and the suppression of taxes. Two more telegrams have been received, and they are transcribed below: (1) To Commander Chiang of the Nanchang Headquarters, the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, President Yu of the Control Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Chairman Chen of Jiangsu Province in Zhenjiang, Director Zhou of the Department of Education, and Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs: In the case of land tax corruption in Songjiang County, County Magistrate Jin Tigan colluded with the grain clerk to exploit the coastal businesses resisting the completion of grain transport, as well as falsely reporting the discounted land in Pubei and suppressing taxes. This was submitted to the Department of Finance for approval, embezzling a total of over 13,000 shi of grain transport from Pubei from the 18th to the 21st year, amounting to over 95,000 yuan. In addition, approximately 8,000 shi of grain transport from Punan (calculated at 2/7 of the collected amount), amounting to over 58,000 yuan, was also embezzled. Not satisfied with this, 60% of the grain transport from Pubei was embezzled in the 22nd year, amounting to over 11,000 yuan. Still thinking this was not enough, in May of this year, the grain clerk was ordered to create records as before for the 22nd year's printed receipts and notices, intending to fully collect taxes and submit only 40%. Unexpectedly, this was reported in June by citizen Lu Boxin, and Chief Ye Zongcheng had to be replaced. In mid-July, Director of Education Zhu Zhaosheng and party member Zhang Huanzhi successively filed lawsuits, and Ye had to be placed under supervision. On one hand, the Department of Finance was requested to correct that the grain transport in Punan was over 7,000 shi, not over 10,000 shi, and that the Pubei portion was not within the suppressed tax range. Later, it was learned that the 23rd year's stamped notices had been used by citizen Xu Shiqi and others to file a lawsuit, so the Department of Finance was informed that they had been lost. The reported amount of suppressed tax initially started as over 10,000 shi, then over 7,000 shi. For the Department of Finance, the actual collected amount of grain transport for the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st years was reduced by over 10,000 shi each year. The grain receipts were not recalled from the grain clerk. Each year, there were over 10,000 shi of these receipts, and even after the Department's order to reduce or exempt 60%, the grain clerk was still ordered to issue receipts for the full amount. This is official embezzlement and cannot be tolerated by national law. It is rumored that the Department of Finance is being lenient due to the County Magistrate's former position as Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. We believe that the most important thing for officials in the Republic of China is integrity. County Magistrate Jin colluded with the grain clerk to embezzle over 100,000 yuan in land tax, with solid evidence and obvious facts. If he is not dismissed and investigated, how can we uphold the rule of law and set an example? Therefore, we specially send this telegram to the superiors for review, urgently requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Government thoroughly investigate and strictly pursue the case, so that corruption does not go unpunished. This is for the public good. Land Zhidao, Standing Secretary of the Sixth District Education Association of Songjiang County. (2) To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, President Yu of the Control Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Director Zhou of the Department of Education: The discounted land and grain transport of the old Huating district in our county is over 7,000 shi in Punan and over 3,000 shi in Pubei. The maps and records are available and easy to investigate. The boundaries are clear, so there should be no confusion. However, County Magistrate Jin Tigan, Section Chief Che Zhao, and East Clerk Chief Ye Zongcheng, because the coastal discounted land businesses in Punan resisted the completion of grain transport, included the discounted land and grain transport from Pubei that had been fully collected in the suppressed and exempted items. They reported that the grain transport in Punan was over 10,000 shi and that there had been no income since last year. They proposed to reduce or exempt 60% and suppress 40% of the 18th-year case starting from the 22nd year. After the Department of Finance approved, they reduced the actual collected amount and uncollected amount of grain transport for the 18th to 21st years by over 10,000 shi of grain each year, but did not cancel the corresponding grain receipts. The Pubei grain transport in the 22nd year was fully collected and reported as 40%. The East Clerk grain transport in the 23rd year continued to be recorded and issued as before, without reducing or exempting 60%. If you check the document submitted by County Magistrate Jin to the Department of Finance in September of last year, as well as the actual collected amounts for past years and the uncollected amount for this year, and examine the grain receipts from the 18th to the 23rd year at the East Clerk's office, you can confirm that he has concealed over 100,000 yuan in taxes. Therefore, we send this telegram to the superiors to thoroughly investigate, to clean up the officialdom and emphasize national revenue. Jiang Yangzong, Standing Director of the Fishery Association of Songjiang County, respectfully. ——————————————————Songjiang</p>
<h3>Meeting and Discussion of County and Township Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>Due to consecutive years of poor harvests in our county, low rice prices, and the collapse of the rural economy, which has affected industry and commerce, resulting in financial depletion and a sluggish market, it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. However, various taxes and levies, such as business tax and brokerage tax, continue to be collected as before. The various chambers of commerce in our county all feel the aforementioned difficulties. Therefore, today (21st), the silk merchants association convened a meeting to discuss the situation. Leading members from the Fengjing, Sijing, Xinzhuang, and Qibao township chambers of commerce attended and reported on the widespread decline in commerce in their respective areas, with numerous businesses closing down. Everyone agreed that the future taxes and levies should be proportional to the actual business situation.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Closure of Teahouses in Zhangze</h3>
<p>Hu Jiamo, the patrol officer of the Zhangze Public Security Outpost, had just taken office when he saw mahjong tiles in a teahouse in the East Market of the town. Considering it gambling and a violation of police regulations, he took the tiles to the station and then returned them. Later, he saw people gambling in a teahouse in the West Market and ordered the police to arrest them. After someone provided bail, it was not approved. Eventually, the chairman of the town's chamber of commerce went to bail them out, and each was fined six yuan before being released. The teahouses in the town believed that Patrol Officer Hu's treatment was unfair, and the teahouse in the West Market was indignant about being fined. As a result, the teahouses unanimously agreed to close their businesses. It is unknown how this will be resolved. Wuxi</p>
<h3>Yuan Dynasty Ancient Stele Discovered in Jianxin Prison</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration, considering the simple facilities and dilapidated buildings of the local prison, specially raised 50,000 yuan to build a new prison. Construction began on August 1st. Recently, while laying the foundation, workers unearthed a piece of rock resembling a monkey, half a brick with a character (yangwen seal character) on it, and a strange purple stone with screw patterns. All of these items are currently being preserved by the local branch court. It is believed that this area was previously the location of the Gaoqiao Patrol Inspection Office and other government offices, so these ancient artifacts were found. Yesterday, while laying the foundation, workers unearthed an ancient stele, with one corner broken off. The text was corroded and incomplete due to age. It is about six feet long and four feet wide. The top of the stone is engraved with six large seal characters, "Record of Rebuilding the Qiaolou Tower." The title is "Record of Rebuilding the Qiaolou Tower in Changzhou Road, Wuxi Prefecture." It is recorded that the first ancestor was promoted to Changzhou as a "lu" in the 14th year of the Yuan Dynasty. Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan Dynasty, Yuanzhen, was promoted to Wuxi as a "zhou" in the first year. This stele is confirmed to be an artifact from the Yuan Dynasty. It is also currently being preserved by the court. Changzhou</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Establishes Four District Sub-bureaus in Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau has stipulated that Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Yixing counties be included in the Fourth District. Zhao Qian is the director of the sub-bureau, and the district sub-bureau is located in Changzhou. The total quota for the entire district is 132,224 yuan. Director Zhao, having received his appointment, arrived in Changzhou on the 20th and has temporarily established the bureau's address at No. 6 Sunfu Lane. All of the directors of the collection offices in the four counties have been separately appointed: Zhu Suigu for Wujin, with a quota of over 50,000 yuan; Zhu Jin for Wuxi, with a quota of 48,000 yuan; Zheng Tinggui for Jiangyin, with a quota of over 17,000 yuan; and the quota for Yixing is the same as Jiangyin, but the selection of the director is still in progress. It is also heard that the sub-bureau and the Wujin sub-office will both open for tax collection today (21st), and public notices have been issued to inform the public. Chongming</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Lawsuit Against Sanle Middle School</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chongming Private Sanle Middle School has achieved excellent results. After the death of former Principal Shi, Tang Songjiu was publicly recommended by the school board to serve as acting principal. This summer, acting Principal Tang requested to resign due to his declining health, so the school board legally elected Huang Daishi as his successor. Unexpectedly, certain retired faculty and staff members plotted to take the position but failed to achieve their desires due to lack of credibility. As a result, they engaged in various forms of sabotage. Recently, they falsely used the names of Lu Nansu and others to file a lawsuit with the Department of Education in an attempt to overthrow the school board. However, Lu Nansu is a pioneer in the academic community who has long retired to the West Lake and does not concern himself with local affairs. On this occasion, he happened to return home to visit relatives and learned of the situation. In addition to first sending a telegram to the Department of Education in Shanghai to clarify, he also conducted a thorough investigation to reveal the truth. Zhenjiang</p>
<h3>Murder Case Occurs in the City</h3>
<p>Meng Shoupeng (aka Xiaoyuan), a 24-year-old from north of the river, resided at No. 41 Shanmenkou in the city. He married a Miss Sun. They had been married for years, but their relationship was not good. The day before, Miss Sun asked her husband for money to buy rice, and an argument broke out. Meng Shoupeng became angry and used a knife, stabbing Miss Sun seven times in the left rib. She immediately bled profusely, fell to the ground unconscious. Neighbors heard the commotion and came to see what had happened. Seeing the tragedy, they immediately called the police, who arrested the perpetrator and transferred him to the court for questioning. Miss Sun died due to severe injuries before she could be treated. The court's prosecutor's office sent personnel to examine the body, confirming that Miss Sun had died from severe injuries. The family was ordered to collect the body and await further investigation. Hangzhou</p>
<h3>Car Speeds and Injures Pedestrian</h3>
<p>On Yingzi Road in Hangzhou City, at 12:15 a.m. the night before, a large bus, number 1608, driven by driver Zhang Pei, was speeding when it was unable to avoid a rickshaw. The rickshaw puller, Wang Zhenwei, and the passenger, Xu Jinqing, were both injured. The officer on duty arrested the driver, and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchant Commits Suicide After Being Scammed</h3>
<p>He Yaoting, a 28-year-old from Hunan, was a silk merchant. On the 12th of this month, he was deceived by a friend to come to Hangzhou and stayed at No. 42 Shenzhou Hotel. Yesterday at midnight, he asked for paper and pen and closed himself in his room to write a suicide note. He then swallowed three boxes of Hongtou Yanghuo (a type of match) to commit suicide. It was not until 12 a.m. the next morning that the tea boy discovered him. Seeing that his face was pale, he knew that he had taken poison and immediately took him to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. Nantong</p>
<h3>Yu Dongqi Homicide Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Xilin, a resident of Yu Dong, was suddenly shot and killed at night. The next morning, when the court's prosecutor arrived for the examination, the ghost cried out for justice, leading to the arrest of the murderer, Zhou Fulang. Zhou confessed that he had committed the crime after having an affair with Zhang Xilin's wife, Wang. The prosecutor's office proposed the death penalty for Zhou Fulang. He was publicly tried by the Criminal Court on the 20th. Ningbo</p>
<h3>Fire on Houtang Street in Jiangdong</h3>
<p>On Houtang Street in Jiangdong, Ningbo, at approximately 2:00 a.m. yesterday (19th), a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Yuan Maoxiang Oil Shop due to negligence with fire. The fire was very fierce. Various fire brigades rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was brought under control after an hour. The fire spread to the neighboring stores: Baoxing Silver Shop, Yuru Bowl Shop, Wang Rentai Copper Shop, Yu Da Mill, Lao Jucheng Scale Shop, Cheng Dachang Iron Shop, Datong Ash Company, and, across the street, Qiankun He Candy Shop, Xu Shun Mat Shop, Luo Tianyuan Foreign Goods Store, Hengchengtai Bowl Shop, Zhou Hengli Paint Shop, Lin Tongxing Southern Goods Store, Jucheng Scale Shop, Jiu Da Mill, and Yuan Chang Southern Goods Store. The losses are estimated to be over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Uprising of Villagers in Guanhaiwei</h3>
<p>Guanhaiwei, located in the northern countryside of Cixi, is a government-owned property. The area within the city walls covers 800 square meters, and the real estate covers over 900 mu. The streets are densely packed, and commerce is thriving. Because the people of Guanhaiwei are known for their strength, officials have historically avoided the area, making it impossible to clear up the government-owned property there. Mu Xiaoqian, a member of the committee clearing up old government properties in Ningbo, in order to be cautious, specially sent Shen Weixiang (a native of Shenshiqiao in Cixi) to conduct a preliminary investigation. After being appointed, Shen, along with a surveyor, went to the area to survey the land, and asked Fang Pinwen, a local gentry and businessman, to assist. The villagers in the area, seeing this situation, thought that it was about to be marked and sold to the public, and were panic-stricken. At approximately 4:00 a.m. yesterday morning, over 2,000 villagers in the area gathered, each carrying a torch, and first went to Fang Pinwen's Three Yuan Towel Factory outside the south gate of the city and set it on fire, causing over 20,000 yuan in damage. All of the factory's employees fled in alarm. After the villagers rioted and set the fire, they wanted to go to the home of the surveyor Shen Weixiang in Shenshiqiao to burn his house and kill him. Fortunately, Shen had good relations in his hometown. Hearing about the riot in Guanhaiwei, he also gathered over 3,000 villagers for self-defense. The villagers in Guanhaiwei, knowing that Shen was prepared, did not dare to attack rashly, and could only stand their ground. After receiving the news, the county magistrate of the county, Cheng Yingju, immediately sent the chief of the County Public Security Bureau, Lü Siyi, to personally lead a large contingent of military police to suppress the riot. After arriving, the chief of the bureau, seeing the seriousness of the situation, realized that it could not be resolved without the strength of the military police. He temporarily stationed the troops outside the city of Guanhaiwei, and entered the city alone to earnestly persuade the villagers and explain the advantages and disadvantages. The 2,000 villagers then dispersed, and the situation gradually returned to normal. After receiving the report, Committee Member Mu in Ningbo immediately sent a representative, Zhang Tong, to rush to Cixi by car in the afternoon to meet with County Magistrate Cheng and thoroughly investigate the situation on the ground in Guanhaiwei. After arriving, County Magistrate Cheng convened an emergency meeting with local gentry at the local chamber of commerce, attended by 26 people including Xu Shaoqi and Hu Hefu. Five items were resolved on the spot, bringing the major disturbance to a close.</p>
<h3>Letter from the East Asia Development Company</h3>
<p>To the respected staff of Shenbao: Greetings.

<p>Yesterday Again</p>
<h3>36 Million Silver Dollars Exported</h3>
<p>34 Million Yuan Shipped to England 1.7 Million Taels Shipped to America After the United States passed the Silver Purchase Act, Shanghai's foreign merchant banks have been continuously shipping large quantities of silver dollars overseas, to England and the United States. There have been seven shipments, totaling over 60 million yuan, which have been reported in detail by this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m., the British mail steamer, the "Rempura," departed with the eighth shipment of silver dollars, amounting to a staggering 34 million yuan. Combined with the previous seven shipments, the total has reached 95 million yuan, a truly alarming figure.</p>
<h3>Huge Shipment to England</h3>
<p>Yesterday's export of silver bullion was one of the largest in recent months. On the afternoon of the 20th, various foreign banks contacted the British company to arrange for loading onto ships. At the same time, they entrusted the Moutai Customs Brokerage to handle the transport. This newspaper had already learned of this, but withheld publication as the ship had not yet left Shanghai. In total, sixteen banks declared shipments, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank, British Bank, American Express, Chase Bank, Eastern Bank, Sino-French Bank, etc. The export consisted of 5,210 boxes of silver bullion and silver dollars, and 3,306 large silver bars, equivalent to approximately 34 million yuan. Among them, HSBC had the most, with 11.5 million yuan, followed by the British Bank with 7 million yuan, Mercantile Bank with 7 million yuan, Citibank with over 4 million yuan, and the rest with several hundred thousand yuan each.</p>
<h3>Careful Loading</h3>
<p>This large batch of silver was all being shipped to England. Due to the huge amount, the loading was divided into two days, and the banks handled it with great care. Moutai was also entrusted to send tugboats to transport the silver to Wharves 12 and 13, where it was transferred to the silver vault of the British mail ship "Lumpura." Armed police were dispatched to protect the transport. 20 million yuan were loaded on the 20th, and another 14 million yuan were loaded yesterday morning. By noon, the entire amount had been transported. It is said that the British company will receive 200,400 yuan in freight. The matter was initially kept quite secret, but by 3:30 PM yesterday, it had already left Shanghai for export.</p>
<h3>Another Batch Shipped to America</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was also a batch of silver bullion being shipped to New York, USA. This was also being transported by various foreign banks. There were more than 1,500 large silver bars, as well as silver ingots and silver coins, totaling over 1.7 million taels of silver. It was entrusted to the Dollar Steamship Lines' "President Grant" to carry and was also exported yesterday. This silver will first go to Seattle and then be transferred to New York.</p>
<h3>Reason for Shipping Silver</h3>
<p>According to a staff member of a bank declaring the silver bullion, in conversation with a reporter, the silver bullion shipped abroad each time is from the Shanghai foreign banks’ existing silver reserves. Due to the sluggish import and export trade in recent years, banks have accumulated huge amounts of silver bullion. It is not cost-effective to keep them idle, so they are being shipped abroad for sale, or perhaps to purchase gold. This has very little impact on the Chinese financial market, he said. All Parties Concerned</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Silver Exported</h3>
<p>Reaching Approximately 90 Million Yuan as of Yesterday. Banking Circles Unanimously Advocate Relief Measures, Implement Controlled Trade and Controlled Silver. Since the United States nationalized silver, China has been exporting huge amounts of silver every day. According to a survey by a major bank in this city, as of yesterday, the total amount of silver exported has reached approximately 90 million yuan, which has aroused serious attention from all parties. The following are the various situations learned yesterday by the Xin Xin News Agency reporter, recorded separately.</p>
<h3>Zou Lin Returns to Beijing, then Goes to Jiangxi to Visit Kong</h3>
<p>Zou Lin, Vice Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago to discuss the silver issue with the banking community in this city. It is now learned that Zou has completed his official business in Shanghai and will take the night express train back to Beijing on Monday. It is reported that after arriving in Beijing, Zou will immediately go to Mount Lu to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to report on the matter. Furthermore, it has been widely rumored in this city recently that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi intends to return to Shanghai early due to the silver price issue. However, according to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance, Kong is still staying in Lushan for a short time. As to when he will leave Jiangxi and return to Shanghai, no telegram has been received here.</p>
<h3>Controlled Trade is the Only Good Policy</h3>
<p>Since the United States raised the price of silver, our country has been exporting huge amounts of silver every day, which has attracted special attention from the entire financial community. As of yesterday, according to a survey by a major bank in this city, the total amount of silver outflow has reached approximately 90 million yuan. The reason for the export is, of course, the relationship of the United States raising the price of silver, but the situation of the shipments is approximately as follows: (1) Speculators seeking profit (For every million yuan shipped from Shanghai to England, a net profit of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan can be made after all expenses, so speculators are emerging one after another); (2) Foreign banks in China are deeply guarding against the central government increasing the silver export tax or prohibiting the export of silver bullion, thus causing the current situation. However, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has stated that he will never implement the above measures in order to stabilize the market. It is reported that the banking community in this city has consulted several times and unanimously believes that if we do not implement controlled trade (that is, reduce imports and try to increase exports) and controlled silver bullion and balance silver prices (that is, make the silver price between our country and foreign countries level), there will be no other good policy for relief. As for the current outflow of silver bullion, it has not had a great relationship due to international trade, and the various Chinese banks have been substantially strengthened over the years, so there is still nothing to worry about.</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Silver Shipped to the US and England</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Office of the International Trade Bureau, speaking to a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency, since the United States nationalized silver, the price of silver abroad has risen sharply. Speculators are collecting huge amounts of silver in China and shipping them to London and New York to make substantial profits. In the coming week, there will continue to be huge amounts of silver bullion shipped out. The following is a list of the silver bars, silver bullion, and silver dollars shipped from Shanghai to foreign countries in the past two weeks, to give a glimpse of the situation. The following are the destinations and the amounts of silver dollars: (1) August 6 to 11 (New York) Silver bars worth 278,000 yuan in national currency, silver bullion worth 702,754.64 yuan in national currency, (San Francisco) 410,000 silver dollars, (London) Silver bars worth 500,000 yuan in national currency, silver bullion worth 1,356,072.68 yuan in national currency, 4,405,000 silver dollars, (Hong Kong) 22,000 yuan (Hong Kong dollars), (2) August 13 to 18 (Singapore) Silver bars worth 6,847.50 yuan in national currency, (Bombay) Silver bullion worth 64,891.94 yuan in national currency, (New York) 10,000 silver dollars, (London) Silver bars worth 1,897,000 yuan in national currency, 8,482,720.07 yuan in silver bullion, 22,070,000 silver dollars, (New York) Silver bars worth 1,000 yuan in national currency, (Japan) Silver bullion worth 335,399.10 yuan in national currency, (Hong Kong) 39,000 silver dollars (Hong Kong dollars) Silver bars worth 480,000 yuan in national currency, (New York) Silver bullion worth 565,978 yuan, Xu Xinliu and others.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Took a Boat to Guling</h3>
<p>Mu Ouchu, Liu Hongsheng and Others Accompany Zhejiang Industrial Bank General Manager Xu Xinliu, Shanghai Yarn Exchange Director Mu Ouchu, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company General Manager Liu Hongsheng, received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Guling and took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangtian Wheel to Jiujiang at 4:00 AM yesterday, then transferred to a car to go up the mountain. It is reported that Xu and others plan to stay in Lushan for a few days for rest and recuperation, and will return to Shanghai around the beginning of September. Ministry of Railways to Construction Bank</p>
<h3>Loan Terms Agreed</h3>
<p>Signature Awaits Railway Advisor’s Return to Beijing for Signing. The Ministry of Railways, in order to complete the railway bridge section between Xixing and Cao'e on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, borrowed 16 million yuan from the China Construction Bank and the Anglo-Chinese Bank. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency visited Song Ziliang, General Manager of the China Construction Bank, on the 21st, and learned that the Ministry of Railways borrowed 16 million yuan from our company, which was previously mistakenly reported as 15 million yuan. Now all the terms have been concretely negotiated and finalized. Only when Minister Gu returns to Beijing from Ping will the loan contract be signed. As for the organization of a syndicate to issue bonds for domestic and foreign sales, it will be decided after the loan is established.</p>
<h3>Zeng Yangfu to Go to Beijing Soon</h3>
<p>Negotiating Public Debt with Banking Circles Hoping for Central Government Approval. Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Zeng Yangfu, Director of Construction of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago to propose the issuance of 20 million yuan in public debt. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that Zeng had contacted the Shanghai banking community yesterday, believing that Zhejiang Province’s treasury expenditure and finances were very difficult, and that a drought had occurred in various places and urgently needed relief. Therefore, the issuance of 20 million yuan in public debt was a matter of great urgency, hoping that the Central Government would approve it. After the Central Government approves and allows the issuance, it will be mortgaged or sold to Shanghai banks. This is a preliminary contact, so there is no concrete decision. Zeng will go to Beijing today or tomorrow to present his case to the Central Government, hoping that it will approve it. As for today's newspapers reporting that Zhejiang Province will issue 30 million yuan in public debt, it is actually a mistake for 20 million yuan. Li Jingcong</p>
<h3>Flew to Ningxia Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>To Meet Ma Hongkui and Discuss the Lanzhou-Ningxia Route Problem Will Not Stay Long in Ningxia, Returning to Shanghai on Friday. The Eurasia Aviation Company’s Lanzhou-Ningxia route (Lanzhou to Ningxia), which opened on June 20th of this year, has suffered heavy losses due to the remote location and sluggish commerce. Recently, there have been preparations to suspend the route. A reporter from the Ri Ri News Agency learned from Cha Zhenwu, the company's secretary, that it is still difficult to determine the suspension of the Lanzhou-Ningxia route because Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui recently sent a representative to discuss the opening of the Ping-Ning route (from Beiping via Baotou to Ningxia). Manager Li went to Beijing to meet with Minister Zhu to ask for instructions. As a result, Minister Zhu believed that it was practically difficult because the Lanzhou-Ningxia line was difficult to maintain, and it was feared that there would be no good results if a new route was opened. Later, Minister Zhu came up with a compromise, that is, the Ping-Ning line plan was cancelled, and the Lanzhou-Ningxia line continued to be opened, and the Lanzhou-Ningxia line was extended to Baotou (ie Lanzhou-Ningxia-Baotou) to facilitate transportation. However, this method requires Li Jingcong to go to Ningxia in person to discuss with Chairman Ma and make a final decision. If there is a way to deal with the funding, this plan can be carried out. Li departed by plane at 9:00 AM yesterday and will not stay long after arriving in Ningxia, and will return to Shanghai on Friday.</p>
<h3>Huang Boqiao Sailed Abroad Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Huang Boqiao, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, was sent by the Ministry to Europe and the United States to inspect railway affairs, and hired a small steamer at 3:00 PM yesterday to cross the customs wharf and board the President Grant steamer to sail abroad. Among those who went to see him off were Huang Jiangquan, representative of Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, Tang Baoshu, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Xu Xiangyuan, Deputy Director, Bao Keyong, Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Wu Shaozeng, Deputy Director of the Bureau, Xu Yuanfang, Jin Weiguo, Mo Heng, and dozens of other chiefs. Huang Boqiao (X) left a photo of himself setting sail abroad (taken by Shun Lian)</p>
<p>On the ship, Huang instructed the bureau members who came to see him off to take good care of the bureau affairs, and said that when he arrived in various countries, he would inform them of his findings at any time for research and reference in order to improve the business. As for Huang's wife, she was delayed due to temporary events and would not depart for five or six days.</p>
<h3>Road Construction and House Tax Beyond Borders</h3>
<p>If the Shanghai Municipal Council Enforces It, the Shanghai Municipal Government Also Has Countermeasures. Shen Shi News Agency reports that taxes in the area of Sichuan Road, Zhabei, where roads are being built beyond the borders, have never been collected. Since the Municipal Finance Bureau implemented the collection this spring, there was a period of turbulence, which was then calmed down, and the people complied with the municipal government's laws. Later, regarding the issue of allocating police officers in the area west of North Sichuan Road, due to the unreasonable opposition of the Japanese side, the two sides negotiated and recently reached an understanding. However, recently, the citizens in the North Sichuan Road area suddenly received a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council stating that the Council would implement the collection of taxes, and that those who do not comply will have their public utilities such as electric lights, telephones, and water completely cut off in the concession. However, the tax revenue in the area has already been handled by the Municipal Government, and now the Municipal Council is taking this action again, which will inevitably cause disputes. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency went to the Fifth District Office of Zhabei yesterday to inquire about the truth. According to the district officer, the Council's plan to collect taxes in the area beyond the North Sichuan Road boundary has recently been heard, but the content is slightly different. According to the ongoing negotiations on the recovery of road construction beyond the borders, a solution is expected soon. The Municipal Government previously, according to the instructions of the Central Government, ordered the Public Security Bureau to deploy patrol police to guard the areas west of North Sichuan Road. At the same time, the Fengle Lane, Yongan Lane, and Makenna Lane near Baole'an Road, Sichuan Road, have been blocked for a long time and cannot be used for traffic with the Chinese territory. Therefore, all taxes have not yet been paid to the Municipal Government. However, these lanes are all places where Japanese expatriates are concentrated. In order to maintain peace and protect foreigners, the District Office has recently dispatched additional posts there, causing the Council to suspect that the Municipal Government will also collect house donations in the area. In order to preemptively strike, it issued a notice first so that the Council can collect this type of tax. However, the territory of these lanes belongs to the Chinese territory, and citizens should pay taxes to the Municipal Government, otherwise it is feared that disputes will arise. If the Council uses coercive methods to cut off electricity and water, the Municipal Government has already prepared to connect it at any time, and the Zhabei side can supply it, so the lives of the citizens will not be affected in the slightest. Consolidate Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang</p>
<h3>Postal Area Assets and Liabilities</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Instructs the Postal Bureau to Establish a Consolidation Account, Which Will Be Transferred Back to the Original Account After the Recovery of Lost Territories. Xin Xin News Agency reports that since the September 18th Incident, postal services in the three northeastern provinces have been blocked. The Ministry of Communications has instructed the General Bureau of Postal Savings and Remittances to handle the registration of depositors in the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal areas in order to clear and return the funds. Regarding the postal accounts of the two districts, the Post Office had requested the Ministry of Communications to end them at the end of this year. It is now learned that the Shanghai Post Office and the General Bureau of Postal Savings and Remittances received an instruction from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating that since Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other places are currently under illegal occupation, and national sovereignty is temporarily suspended, all assets and liabilities in these areas should still be retained. However, in order to distinguish them from the assets of other areas, a separate consolidation account should be established, named the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang Consolidation Account, which should be divided into two parts according to its nature: postal and savings remittance. All assets and liabilities in these two districts, except for savings, should be transferred to this account, and a separate schedule with detailed figures should be compiled and attached after the balance sheet. In the future, the changes in the assets and liabilities of the two districts will be consolidated in this account. When Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other places are recovered, they will be transferred back to the original account. This order is hereby given for compliance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Maneuvers Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Not Announced in Advance, Causing Great Panic Among the People. Da Mei Evening News reports that the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai conducted large-scale maneuvers in the Public Concession between midnight and 6:00 AM this morning (the 21st). The maneuvers were not announced to the public in advance. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the Japanese Naval authorities notified the Shanghai Municipal Council and the commanders of the US Fourth Marine Regiment and other foreign troops stationed in the Public Concession. At midnight, the entire Japanese Marine Corps, totaling about 1,200 men, departed from the headquarters of the new barracks on Jiangwan Road in military vehicles, carrying various new types of war equipment. Because of the hot weather, the Chinese people who were sleeping by the roadside were suddenly startled by the armed vehicles, tanks, artillery vehicles, and motorized vehicles passing by in the middle of the night. The main areas of the maneuvers were the Hongkou Park area in Hongkou District and the area near Gordon Road and Robison Road in the Western District. Japanese sailors deployed their formations in these areas, and the electric lights of messengers flashed across the sky from time to time. At 6:00 AM, the 1,200 exhausted soldiers finished their maneuvers and returned to their camps in military vehicles. This morning, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy claimed that the maneuvers had no special significance. However, it is generally believed that this was the largest military maneuver in Shanghai since the Sino-Japanese War in 1932, as the area of last night's maneuvers included the entire concession. Cai Yangqi Case</p>
<h3>Statement by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>The Police Unreasonably Returned Lang Zuyin's Summons, Which is a Clear Violation of the Agreement, and I Have Already Raised a Protest. Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st. Regarding the case of Cai Yangqi, there have been repeated reports in the newspapers in recent days. According to a statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai Public Concession, all litigation documents are effective after being signed by a judge and should be delivered or executed separately. The administrative authorities of the concession should immediately deliver the summons signed by the court's judge without any hesitation, which is undoubtedly correct. Unexpectedly, the authorities of the concession repeatedly returned the official summons of the First Special District Court to Lang Zuyin, a police detective from the Cai Yangqi private prosecution, without reason, and did not order the person summoned to appear in court for interrogation. This erroneous attitude and action is a clear violation of the agreement. The court has been negotiating with the authorities of the concession for a long time, but it has not been resolved. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now lodged a formal protest with the ambassadors of the countries concerned. In addition, there are similar cases in the French Concession, and protests have been lodged with the French ambassador at the same time.</p>

<h3>The Third Batch of 2,000 Bags Started Shipping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Jiangxi Provincial Government, in order to curb the rising rice prices in the local area, has successively entrusted the Yumin Bank to purchase 13,000 shi of Hunan Indica and Anhui Indica from Shanghai in small quantities, which have been shipped in two batches. The profiteers who hoard and hoard in the local area, because Shanghai rice is imported in batches and the authorities sell it at parity prices, have all started to sell out first. The number one rice before Shanghai rice was handled has fallen from 14 yuan and 7 jiao to 11 yuan and 5 jiao, and the number two rice has also fallen from 12 yuan and 5 jiao to 10 yuan. The reason for the sharp decline, according to the director of the Yumin Bank Office to Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, is (1) sold by Shanghai Yumin Bank, (2) it has been raining heavily in recent days, and people's hearts are stable, (3) new grains from various places have been launched, (4) The authorities also take into account people's food and cancel their passports, so the rice price is expected to be stable, and the food future of the people is no longer worrying. Yesterday, the Yumin Bank Office also loaded 2,000 bags of rice from the Sanbei Company's Changxing wheel. There are still 3,000 bags of rice purchased and stored in Shanghai. Yesterday, due to the large amount of goods, the departure was postponed. As for the 8,000 bags of future rice in September, they will be scheduled to ship at the end of next month. City Chamber of Commerce Telephones Jiangxi Provincial Government</p>
<h3>Exemption of Porcelain Transport Tax</h3>
<p>New Voice Society reports that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed to Xiong, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, yesterday: "To Chairman Xiong of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in Nanchang, Greetings. On the 20th of this month, we received a letter from the National Guild of Porcelain Merchants in Jingdezhen, stating that when the Jiangxi Provincial Government organized the Post-Banditry Rehabilitation Goods Production and Sales Donation in the 21st year of the Republic of China, porcelain was also included in the levy. At that time, our colleagues repeatedly argued based on laws and regulations, and the porcelain production and sales donation was immediately cancelled and changed to a special porcelain business tax, which was allocated to porcelain merchants to undertake according to the recognized amount. Our colleagues, considering the government's difficulty in raising funds for bandit suppression, reluctantly bore the burden as a subsidy donation for porcelain merchants, which was also a substitute name for the production and sales donation, and repeatedly received approval from the Jiangxi Provincial Finance Department to abolish it simultaneously with the production and sales donation. In June of this year, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, in order to relieve production in the province, abolished the production donation, and the special porcelain business tax should be cancelled according to the established case, and the responsibility borne by the porcelain merchants has also ended, without any doubt. Unexpectedly, the Provincial Government and the Finance Department changed the name and changed the special porcelain business tax to porcelain business tax, approving an annual tax amount of 210,000 silver dollars, still to be borne by the porcelain merchants. A temporary production donation has been transformed into a permanent business tax, purely deceiving our colleagues and concealing it from the central government. Moreover, according to the new regulations on business tax issued by the Ministry of Finance, the principle of tax collection should be based on the place of business or the place of manufacture, and it is clearly stipulated that no tax should be levied on goods or business tax similar to likin. If our porcelain merchants travel to the town to purchase porcelain and transport it to various ports, it is purely a transport business and there is no place of business or place of manufacture in the town. According to laws and regulations, there is no obligation to pay taxes. However, the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Finance Department are using the name of collecting business tax in disguise, actually restoring the disguised likin, disregarding the central government's laws and regulations, and disregarding the resolutions of the National Financial Conference. Therefore, our colleagues in the town are extremely indignant and have repeatedly telegraphed to express their firm refusal to recognize it. Unexpectedly, the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Finance Department have sent two members, Lu Yu and Zhao Shixun, to the town to force Zhang Weimin, the former director of the special porcelain business tax bureau, to restore the bureau card that has been abolished for more than a month within three days. Our colleagues in the town are under duress and cannot reason with them, and can only helplessly send representatives Wu Kejia, Liu Nianwu, Wang Shoujiang, Xiong Jingcheng, He Shimo, etc. to Nanchang, the capital, and other places to appeal. We have always admired your association's enthusiasm in maintaining national products and sympathizing with the difficulties of merchants. We hereby specially request your association to investigate and approve the transfer of the letter to request the abolition of illegal taxes in order to save transport merchants and maintain public interests." Upon investigation, when your province first organized the porcelain production donation, the porcelain merchants argued that it violated the general proposal to abolish likin and hindered transportation and sales. Our association wrote to the central government and your government to request a legal suspension, and our association's former standing committee member Wang Yansong personally went to Nanchang to negotiate. Your Excellency took the central government's clear order to abolish likin as important and specially cancelled the porcelain production and sales donation and changed it to a special porcelain business tax, which was handled by the industry through a bureau. However, the tax collection method was still a transit tax in nature and a short-term transitional matter. Therefore, the porcelain merchants also understood the difficulties of the time and reluctantly complied. All these circumstances are documented in your government's archives, so there is no need to repeat them. Since the special business tax is a production and sales donation with a changed name, the duration of the special business tax should be limited to the duration of the production and sales donation. Now that your province has abolished the production donation, the porcelain special tax business tax has also been ordered to be changed to porcelain business tax, and the tax collection method is consistent with your government's policies and measures and is appropriate. However, according to the business tax collection method, there is a business tax law originally discussed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government for reference. The main point of this law is that taxpayers are limited to manufacturers or sellers, but not transport merchants. Therefore, Article 3, Section 1 of the Business Tax Law lists the name of the store as one of the essential requirements. Collecting from transport merchants is a transit tax, and the boundary between business tax and likin is distinguished here. Article 9 of this Business Tax Law stipulates that business tax should be paid directly by the taxpayer to the collecting agency and should not be contracted or handled by others. This is because likin is mostly contracted by merchants with fixed proportions, and competition is rampant, with endless malpractices, so the tax law prevents it in advance and explicitly prohibits it. The National Financial Conference this year resolved to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees, and its defined scope of exorbitant fees is divided into nine items. The sixth item is the tax levied on goods or vehicles passing through, which hinders transportation. Therefore, your province's organization of a legitimate porcelain business tax should not pre-determine the contracted amount, set up checkpoints, and collect from transport merchants. Judging from national tax laws and the Ministry's discussion on abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees, the order issued by the government to all provinces is undoubtedly correct. According to the letter, it is reasonable to telegraph your government to review and approve it, and to approve that the scope of tax collection and all methods of the porcelain business tax to be organized in the near future should be handled in accordance with the promulgated Business Tax Law, and all those similar to transit taxes should be corrected in order to respect the rule of law and conform to the merchants' sentiments, which is convenient for the public. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows and begs."</p>
<h3>Yang Can-san's Foreign Investment Case</h3>
<p>A letter from the Sichuan Association to the Juxingcheng Bank reports that Yang Can-san, the general manager of the Juxingcheng Bank, is in contact with a large loan in the United Kingdom. Some say that the mineral and railway resources of the entire province are used as collateral, which concerns sovereignty. The Sichuan Association in Shanghai specially wrote to the Juxingcheng Bank to inquire. The incoming and outgoing letters are published below:</p>
<h3>Letter from the Association</h3>
<p>"Dear Sir, We have received reports from various newspapers in this city that your bank has signed a contract with the British London Dexian Company for a joint financial company, including clauses such as subsidizing development and reorganizing industries and mineral resources in Sichuan Province. There is also talk of signing a loan of 50 million yuan, which concerns sovereignty. Please provide a factual reply so that the association can study it. Thank you for your public spirit."</p>
<h3>Reply from Juxingcheng Bank</h3>
<p>"Dear Sir, Yang Can-san of our bank went to England to contact foreign investment. He had discussed with British merchants in advance, but had no relationship with the British Minister Lampson. It is purely a commercial act between Juxingcheng Bank and the British Dexian Company. The Sichuan Provincial authorities have not entrusted us with anything. However, under the conditions of not harming sovereignty and legality, the Sichuan authorities should not object or will facilitate it. The 24 articles of the contract published in the newspapers have not yet been received by our bank from Yang. Whether it is completely true cannot be determined. However, based on the spirit of what is published in the newspapers, the purpose is to use foreign investment to develop Sichuan's guardian industry. Juxingcheng Bank is the agency for the inflow and outflow of funds. The manager's receipt and payment of funds is a business that the bank should have. The Lianyi Financial Company is a Chinese-foreign joint organization specializing in introducing foreign investment. It is fully registered and registered in accordance with Chinese law. Among the five directors, three are Chinese, and the general manager is also Chinese. Other points regarding personnel employment and administration also give priority to hiring Chinese, and various materials also give priority to using Chinese materials or other cheap materials, and are not subject to racial restrictions. It takes care of sovereignty everywhere and has no drawbacks. As for the industrial company that accepts foreign investment, that is, the cooperation company mentioned in the contract, it is not subject to any restrictions, and can borrow and repay at any time. The long-term interest rate shall not exceed 5% per annum, and the short-term interest rate shall not exceed 8%. If there is a loss, foreign investment is also willing to accept a considerable loss, which is fair and equitable. Your association is a Sichuan public welfare organization, and it should do its best to prevent anything that harms Sichuan's rights and interests, and it should also uphold justice if it is beneficial to Sichuan. The use of foreign investment to seek construction in the country is a clear indication of Sun Yat-sen's legacy. Why should Sichuan be criticized for mentioning it? What can be asserted is that (1) Yang Can-san's signing of a contract to use foreign investment is purely a commercial act and does not represent the entire province in signing a contract with foreign countries; (2) there is no act of mortgaging the mineral resources of the entire province or selling the mineral resources of the entire province, and Sichuan has no railway, let alone mortgaging railway revenue; (3) the scope of investment, the so-called Sichuan industry and mineral resources, is only a purpose of self-investment and does not restrict the nature of other parties. If someone in Sichuan runs a certain industry and mineral resource and does not borrow foreign investment from Lianyi Company, Lianyi Company cannot force it to borrow it. If all the industrial companies in Sichuan think that the loan terms are not suitable and do not borrow this foreign investment, the investment fact will disappear invisibly; (4) The organization of Lianyi Company should be registered and registered in accordance with Chinese law according to the contract. If there is any inappropriateness, the government has the right to reject or revise it. Our bank internally observes the situation in Sichuan. The government and the people do not have sufficient funds to develop industry. Now there is this low-interest fund. It is necessary to use it legally and without harming sovereignty. I hope that people of insight at home and abroad will study the content of the contract in detail and do not hinder the opportunity for construction with emotional impulses. Also, Yang Can-san can return to China in late September, and the details can be announced by himself at that time."</p>

<h3>Summary of Labor Disputes in Shanghai in the Past Five Years</h3>
<p>A total of 1,491 cases, mainly due to layoffs and business closures. According to the compilation by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau and recently published by Zhonghua Book Company, there were about 300 labor disputes in Shanghai every year in the past five years, from 17 to 21 years, involving a total of 11,799 factories and 4,847,881 workers. The main causes of disputes were employment or dismissal, wages, labor contracts, and treatment. As a result of disputes, due to political, economic, and organizational reasons, the number of cases in which the labor side won completely has decreased year by year, and the number of cases in which the labor side failed has gradually increased. 87.46% of the cases were mediated or reconciled by the Social Bureau. Among the various industries, the textile industry had the most disputes, especially the silk and cotton weaving industries, followed by the commodity sales industry. The number of disputes involving foreign factories has also shown an increasing trend. In most cases, the number of workers involved in each case was less than 10, and most involved one factory. However, more than half of the cases were delayed for 11 to 50 days. As for the various materials, there is a detailed analysis in the book. The book compiles and revises the statistics of disputes published in the past, and adds the unpublished materials of recent years. It not only has a precise discussion on the changes and reforms of the mediation system and the rise and fall of disputes, but also exposes the controversial cases that cannot be collected and prepared from the outside. It is the entire history of labor conflicts in the city in the past five years.</p>
<h3>Recruited Seamen Dismissed by the China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<h3>Premier Liu Agrees to Place Them in New Ships</h3>
<p>The petition comes to an end. The state-owned China Merchants Bureau, in order to tighten its finances and save expenses, laid off two sailors per ship. The laid-off sailors argued that the bureau was ordered to lay off employees, but now it is laying off sailors instead of officials. Therefore, the sailors have been innocently dismissed and are inconsistent with the Ministry's order. Therefore, the dismissed sailors, Yang Yulong, Xu Axia, and more than 20 others, went to the Jun'an Association to make noise every day, forcing Li Caichen, the director of the Jun'an Association, to negotiate with the bureau. Li persuaded them repeatedly to no avail, so he first went to Du Yuesheng, Yang Ying, and Jin Tingsun for help, and then went to Liu Hongsheng's garden in Fanhangdu on the afternoon of the 20th to see General Manager Liu and request the revocation of the order to lay off sailors. Li went with him. Each sailor held incense to Liu's garden. When they saw Liu, they all knelt down and pleaded. General Manager Liu said, "This kind of behavior is from 20 years ago. There is no need to do this now." When he said this, Liu also kowtowed to everyone. Then, the sailors asked why they were laying off workers instead of officials. Liu said that officials also need to be laid off, not just you. If you are dissatisfied with me and have any actions against me, I can resign from my position in the bureau. I am very grateful to you and am willing to take out 100,000 yuan for your living expenses, but I will hand it over to the Siming Public Office for safekeeping." Then, Li asked for it again, and General Manager Liu considered that the sailors had been in office for a long time and were innocent on weekdays. Once they were laid off, their livelihood would be cut off, which was really pitiful. He said to everyone, "Go back first. When the Sihai ship built in London arrives in Shanghai and starts classes, I will give you priority to place you in jobs in order to maintain your livelihood." Everyone then withdrew and was taken back to the Jun'an Association by Li. This matter came to an end.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Employees of the China Merchants Cargo Handling Bureau</h3>
<p>Refuting the Declaration of the Maritime Mutual Aid Association. The employees of the China Merchants Cargo Handling Bureau, because the Shanghai Maritime Mutual Aid Association despises the employees, issued a declaration yesterday: "The declaration of the Shanghai Chinese Maritime Mutual Aid Association can be said to represent capitalism and exhaust its ugly face. It is true that the colleagues of the association belong to their own duties, but what if they do not conform to the spirit of the existing party rule? The Premier created the Three Principles of the People, with the primary emphasis on people's livelihood. When he opened the government in Guangzhou, he personally planted the Maritime Trade Union. His concern for the difficulties of workers and his love for the masses can be said to be the pioneer of the Chinese revolution and the benefit of the people, which cannot be measured. Anyone who has slightly examined the principles of the Party will regard it as a standard and call it a savior. However, the association actually goes against the grain, comparing the business director to the master and clearly looking at the employees angrily. It says (the coachman must sweat profusely when running, but cannot attack the comfort of his master,) and (to live on salary and be loyal to one's duties, one has no merit to reside on,). How should we workers work hard to repay the grace of our master to the fullest extent? According to the employee declaration of the Maritime Mutual Aid Association, it is also said that (since the situation changed after the 18th year, the employees have something to rely on.) The employee's reliance is the Chinese Maritime Trade Union. The Chinese Maritime Trade Union is produced by the policies of the entire Party. Opposing what the employees rely on is no different from opposing the Party's policies. Opposing the Party's policies, the meaning of the existing government is something that we workers dare not speculate. The association also uses (the case has been submitted to the Ministry for review and handling, but we can only wait for the Ministry's order to resolve it,) to prevaricate the workers' demands in order to delay the time. However, the business director himself already belongs to the high-level contracting foreman who should be abolished. May I ask what does the employee's application to the contracting foreman have to do with the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, let alone the Ministry of Communications? What the employees are now requesting is four points: the business director should abolish and reduce the exploitation of the workers, distribute the profits, and enable the hard-working workers to support their families. As for the so-called (lazy work, increased meal expenses,) it is really not worth the laughter of those who know. What our cargo handling employees are in charge of is the number of pieces of cargo. The responsibility for compensation for damage does not lie with us. Now, what is the so-called compensation, is it in the number of pieces or in the damage? There are many people in the world who can distinguish between fish eyes and pearls. Although the words are spoken, they only see the heart tired and clumsy. The so-called (in the past, when flat employment was used, it was not based on talent, but mostly on the authority of the introducer to determine the salary,) etc. Our cargo handling employees have been working for the China Merchants Bureau for more than 30 years, and at least 10 years. The qualifications of the old are unmatched by other companies. And the current business directors were all appointed by Zhao Tieqiao when he was the general manager, and it has only been five or six years. Tracing back to the employees' employment, the current business directors had nothing to do with the China Merchants Bureau, so how can they talk nonsense? The so-called (if the cargo handling employees can have precise methods to manage the goods and reduce the compensation, then the directors are also willing to add the money for compensation to the employees). This number of pieces can only be sought from the managers of the bureau. The responsibility for damage belongs to management. Whether it is proper or not is not something that our workers can intervene in. These cool words are a pity that they are scratching the surface and are not used in the right way. If those who are born in the East and accustomed to the East also issue this lofty argument, they will inevitably forget their own business and imitate others, and ask themselves whether they can not be ashamed. In short, what our cargo handling employees demand is that the income from hard work should be enough to support their wives and children and prevent them from freezing and starving. As for the business directors living in foreign houses, riding in cars, and calling slaves and maids, it is not what our employees expect, and they dare not even hope to catch up. Our cargo handling employees are sincerely willing to offer their foolish wisdom and do their best to repay their service. They also really do not want to occupy high positions to compensate for their romantic lives and be parasites who get something for nothing. Other trivial matters are not worth arguing about. The society has its own public opinion. I hope that the Maritime Mutual Aid Association will cooperate with the Maritime Trade Union with the sincerity of labor and capital cooperation and consider the suffering of the workers, and quickly seek a solution. Otherwise, the employees have been waiting for eight months, which can be said to have exhausted the sincerity of protecting the national enterprise. If the business director shirks his responsibility and a workers' strike occurs, the responsibility for hindering the state-owned enterprise and destroying the workers' movement should be borne by the Maritime Mutual Aid Association and the business directors of the various shipping companies. Do not say that you were not warned. This declaration is hereby made."</p>
<h3>News from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>"Anhui Province Drought Disaster Photography. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association at 97 Renji Road has recently received an unusual number of letters and telegrams from various provinces reporting on the severe water and drought disasters. It is reported that it plans to send personnel to the disaster areas in the near future to conduct on-site investigations. Now, the drought situation in various counties of Anhui Province is extracted as follows: (1) Susong: The county has been suffering from a severe drought for three months. The seedlings have withered, the fields are all red, and recently the rivers have no flow and the wells have no water. Drinking water is already in short supply. In addition, there is no old grain left and there is no hope for new grain. People are suffering from hunger and thirst and have no way to beg for grain. People who commit suicide by closing their doors have been heard of every day. The miserable situation is truly worthy of pity. (2) Zhide: The county has been unfortunate for years. The flood in Xinwei caused great damage. The rural areas collapsed and all industries withered. In addition, the bandit disaster turned the houses into ruins. The people's livelihood has reached its extreme. This year, it has been hit by a severe drought again. There has been no rain for two months. The scorching sun is steaming, the ponds and dams are dry, and the fields and grains have all withered. There is no hope for the autumn harvest. The future of the disaster is unimaginable. What is even more dangerous is that more than 10,000 refugees have gathered in a corner of the city and town, and the population has doubled. The rice is empty and the source is cut off. If urgent measures are not taken to provide relief, the masses of disaster victims will surely suffer a great disaster. (3) Ningguo: The county has not received a drop of rain for 80 days, resulting in no flow in the rivers and swamps, cracking of farmland, and scorching of crops. There is no hope for the autumn harvest. Some villages have tried their best to draw water from afar to irrigate, but because the long-term drought-stricken fields have no sufficient amount of water to irrigate, they have ultimately worked hard to no avail. It is estimated that 150,000 lives in the county have been completely trapped in the disaster. (4) Huaining: After years of disasters, the rural areas have collapsed, and it is difficult to recover. There has been no rain in February this year, the fields and crops have withered, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. Residents have no strength to replant, and their livelihoods are unsustainable. Old and weak people who try to commit suicide are not uncommon. In addition, the plague is spreading day by day, and there is no remedy. The disaster is continuing. (5) Xuancheng: There has been no rain in the county for three months, and the drought is unprecedented in a century. The riverbeds are cracked, and there is no source for irrigation and drinking water. The fields are all scorched yellow, like remnant grass, and the livelihood of farmers is in a very dangerous situation. (6) He County: There has been no rain in the county for two months, the fields and crops have withered, and the autumn harvest is about to be lost. The commercial market and finance are collapsing, rice prices are soaring, people are panicked, and bandits are lurking. The local order is in a very dangerous situation. (7) Hefei: In the fourth district of the county, the ridges are long and there are few rivers and lakes. Now, it has been hit by a severe drought and has become a disaster area. Residents have no drinking water, and 80,000 to 90,000 people are dying. The local security situation has become impossible to maintain. (8) Dongliu: The county has always been poor and has suffered disasters for several years. The livelihood is difficult to maintain. The drought this summer is also extremely severe. There is no water in the dams and ponds, and the fields and crops are all dry. Food for the people after autumn is worrying, and there is no way to maintain it at present. The old and weak are waiting to die, and the strong are taking risks. The disaster is unprecedented in a century. (9) Tongcheng: The county has been suffering from a drought for more than 60 days, the ponds have become land, the fields have cracked, and the seedlings are all scorched red. Looking at a red plain, the disaster is truly unbearable to look at. (10) Qianshan: There has been no rain in the county for two months, the rivers have dried up, the farmland has cracked, the crops have withered, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. Villagers are crying with the crops in their arms, and there are people everywhere who are dying with the dry crops in their arms. The current disaster situation is extremely bitter. It is reported that the association is very anxious because it has no large sums of money for the current water and drought disasters, and it is difficult to help. It urgently hopes that all philanthropists will quickly extend a helping hand to provide relief."</p>

<h3>Wuhua Bank Suddenly Announces Closure</h3>
<p>The bank was unable to manage due to being implicated by the head office. Important documents were moved out first, and then the business was closed. The Wuhua Industrial Trust Bank, located at No. 130 Ningbo Road, Public Concession, suddenly announced its closure yesterday morning. The causes and consequences of its bankruptcy are investigated and recorded below.</p>
<h3>Wuhua's History</h3>
<p>The head office of Wuhua Industrial Trust Bank is located in Guangzhou and was founded by overseas Chinese, specializing in savings, trust, and other businesses. The business was barely manageable. However, because Guangzhou was difficult to develop, a branch was established in Shanghai in November last year. The total capital was 1 million yuan, raised from Guangzhou and Shanghai, and Fan Shaoliang, a 32-year-old from Zhenjiang, was appointed as the general manager. It officially opened on November 12 last year. At that time, it was able to attract investment, so the business situation was better than the head office. Therefore, in May, a branch was opened at No. 162 Route Macao in the French Concession, with Wang Jian'e as the manager.</p>
<h3>Cash Flow Problems</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, in June of this year, a disturbance occurred at the Guangzhou head office. All depositors rushed to withdraw funds, causing the head office to be overwhelmed. It urgently telegraphed the Shanghai branch for assistance. At that time, the Shanghai branch remitted 750,000 yuan in cash to support the crisis. However, the Shanghai branch became outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and its credibility in the financial community was greatly affected. At the same time, because the loans released at the end of last year could not be recovered as scheduled, it felt more and more unable to manage. It tried every possible means to raise money, but unexpectedly lost about 400,000 yuan. When the money shops received the news, they immediately stopped dealing with it, and the depositors also went to withdraw funds one after another. The bank knew that the situation was not good, so it urgently telegraphed the head office for assistance.</p>
<h3>Implementing Closure</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the head office could not respond and knew that the Shanghai branch was having difficulty supporting itself. Therefore, it went bankrupt the day before yesterday. After receiving this news, the Shanghai branch still tried to support itself, trying to raise funds to deal with the current situation. However, it was unable to manage, and finally decided to declare closure the day before yesterday at about 6:00 PM, with a difference of more than 19,500 yuan. All important documents were transported out by hired cars at that time. General Manager Fan Shaoliang is said to have fled. There is no definite news on how to handle the aftermath. However, the bank posted a notice at the door.</p>
<h3>Depositor Registration</h3>
<p>The notice stated: (This bank is temporarily closed due to cash flow problems. We have telegraphed the Guangzhou head office to request instructions, hoping to resume business as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will be responsible for liquidation. At present, the deposits and debts are sufficient to offset each other. We will never disappoint the depositors. Please forgive us. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of Wuhua Industrial Trust Bank.) At the same time, next to the notice was another notice signed by lawyer Lou Yunmei, which stated that the bank had suddenly announced its closure after only a few months of opening, which was obviously fraudulent. Last night (the 20th), in the dead of night, a certain company's car was hired to move out property, and the company was inevitably helping to escape. It was also heard that the head office was also using the excuse of cash flow problems to entrust a lawyer to liquidate. The bank was opened not long ago and then went bankrupt, which was an organized fraud. He volunteered to represent the depositors and pursue the recovery of deposits from the bank. He also formally organized a creditors' group in the office at No. 2, Lane 96, Avenue Joffre, to conduct everything. It is also known that Lou Yunmei is also a depositor of the bank and is also a victim. Therefore, how the bank will be liquidated is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Patrolmen Capture Thieves</h3>
<h3>Both Sides Exchange Gunfire Along the Way</h3>
<p>One thief was shot and fell to the ground and was captured. One thief was arrested in Baolong Garden. - A stray bullet injured a rickshaw puller - Wang Zhenlin, a local man, 47 years old, has been running the Xin Sen Chang cigarette paper shop at No. 157 Route Paulun, French Concession, for years. Wang has a son named Jinlin, who is 27 years old. At 9:15 last night, two bandits suddenly came. One bandit held a pistol and broke into the shop, threatening them to keep quiet. They stole about 100 yuan in cash, silver dollars, and small coins, and fled. Jinlin chased after them and shouted loudly for thieves. Chinese constables from No. 244 nearby heard the alarm and rushed to help chase and arrest them. One thief fired six or seven shots along the way. The constable chased and fired, firing eight or nine shots in total. At the same time, Chinese constables from No. 638 also came to help fire and arrest them. As a result, one thief was shot in the neck and fell to the ground and was captured. A suspected woman, Guo Luo, 52 years old, was arrested by the roadside. A stray bullet also hit the face of a rickshaw puller. They were all taken to the police station for questioning. The thief, Zhou Wu, 23 years old, from Jiangbei, confessed to colluding with accomplices to commit robbery. Afterwards, detectives found a six-inch Browning pistol left behind by a thief in the garage at No. 14 Baolong Garden, Route Albert. There was still one bullet in the chamber. After questioning, the chief of detectives immediately sent the thief and the rickshaw puller to the hospital for treatment and ordered a strict search for the remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3>Japanese Smuggle Heroin</h3>
<h3>The Scheme Failed and They Were Stranded in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that Okada Yoshitaro, a Japanese businessman from the Shandong Wood Pipe Factory on Wusong Road, Qingdao, recently requested the police of the Japanese Consulate General in this port to investigate the address of Japanese national Yoshikawamatsu. On the 19th, it was discovered that Fang lived at No. 125 Dingxingli, Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road. Yoshikawamatsu and Okada originally jointly operated the Shandong Wood Pipe Factory in Qingdao. On June 19, they came to Shanghai from Qingdao and sold wooden printing rods worth 616 yuan to the Shanghai Textile Company. They immediately colluded with a Chinese man named Zhang to buy three bags of heroin worth 500 yuan. At the end of the same month, they planned to go to Jinan with Zhang to sell them. Unexpectedly, when waiting for the train at the North Station, the police of the Public Security Bureau smelled the prohibited items in the bag. Zhang was arrested and the heroin was confiscated. Yoshikawamatsu took the opportunity to escape. However, because the matter was exposed, he was in a dilemma and remained stranded in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>International Dispensary</h3>
<h3>Accused of Selling "High Roots"</h3>
<p>The quantity does not match the records. The debate ended yesterday and sentencing is pending. Chinese Detective Song Bingzheng and Detective Chen Yaoting of the Narcotics Division of the General Inspectorate received a report from an informant named Yao that "High Roots" were being sold at the International Dispensary at No. 328 Fuzhou Road. They immediately ordered Yao to go there at 12:00 AM the day before yesterday and purchase ten grams. After that, they raided the dispensary and seized one and a half taels of "High Roots". They arrested the manager, Shi Zhili, and the business director, Xu Shansheng. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Summary Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the International Dispensary operated by the defendants had registered with the Department of Health. According to the regulations for the management of narcotics, the dispensary could sell "High Roots", but only with a doctor's prescription. The number of goods purchased and sold must also be recorded in the accounts. However, it was found that 336 grams of "High Roots" had been purchased and sold according to the International Dispensary's records. Why was there still one and a half taels of "High Roots"? Therefore, they were prosecuted in accordance with Articles 5 and 15 of the regulations for the management of narcotics, Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Shi Zhili stated when questioned, "I do not consult on business matters, so I am not aware of the details of this case." Xu Shansheng stated, "Our pharmacy sells 'High Roots' only with a doctor's prescription. However, there was a reason for this sale. Tan Jinyun, an apprentice from a certain pharmacy, used to be a colleague at a certain pharmacy. Tan came on Friday and wanted to sell 'High Roots'. I told him that it could only be sold with a doctor's prescription. He came again on Saturday and said that the prescription could be obtained. I replied that it could be done. On Sunday at noon, Tan came again during lunch and asked me to buy it immediately, saying that the prescription had been taken and would be delivered immediately. So I took it and gave it to him. I did not expect that one of the people who came with Tan would take the medicine away. Because Tan is a colleague, I trusted him. Unexpectedly, the police came to raid the dispensary shortly afterwards. As for why there was still one and a half taels of 'High Roots' when the accounts recorded that all the 'High Roots' had been sold, there was a reason. Suppose a doctor bought ten grams of 'High Roots', and the account has been entered, but the doctor suddenly returned five grams. Because the accounts cannot be changed, they can only be left without entering. This is why this number is exceeded. Moreover, the difference between the quantity when purchasing and the quantity when selling is three huatuo, which is also the reason for the excess." Tan Jinyun then testified that Yao entrusted him to find a way to buy "High Roots". So I discussed it with the International Dispensary, but Xu insisted on a doctor's prescription. Yao said that it could be obtained, and the rest of the testimony was the same as mine. Judge Zhan Liangce then began the debate. After the police lawyer Qian and the defendant's lawyers Le Junying and Le Junfen debated, the court announced that the debate in this case was over and set Saturday for the verdict to be announced. The two defendants were each allowed to post a 200 yuan cash bond.</p>
<h3>Three Homicide Cases Occurred in Nanshi, West Shanghai, and Zhabei</h3>
<p>Two suicides… One wrongful death</p>
<h3>Swallowing Opium in Anger</h3>
<p>Guo Chunyang, a Jingjiang native who lived at No. 180 Xiqiao South Road, Nanshi, and pulled a rickshaw, brought his wife, Guo Zhang, from his hometown to Shanghai last year because of the harsh life in the countryside. The day before yesterday, the woman wanted to return to her mother's house in Ningbo due to an urgent matter and asked her husband for 20 yuan for travel expenses. Guo replied that he had no money, so she reduced her request to 10 yuan. But Guo only paid 5 yuan at the time. Because it was not enough for her use, she became angry and, at about 2:00 PM, had the idea of ending her life. She swallowed opium behind people's backs, hoping to commit suicide. At about 7:00 PM, the husband returned home after finishing work and saw that his wife's face was abnormal and she had severe abdominal pain. He realized that she had taken poison and took Guo Zhang to the Fangxie Road Women and Children's Hospital for emergency treatment. After examination by the hospital doctor, it was diagnosed as heatstroke. After treatment, he was instructed to take her home. Unexpectedly, Guo Zhang revealed that she swallowed opium to end her life. However, it was too late to save her, and she died at about 9:00 PM the night before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Burned to Death by Hot Ash</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhenquan, from Xuzhou, came to Shanghai from his hometown two years ago. After being introduced by someone, he worked at the Qian Yunji Soap Factory in the north of Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Unexpectedly, while working in the raw material room the day before yesterday, he accidentally fell into a lime vat. The lime in the vat was being steamed, and his whole body was severely burned by the lime in an instant. He was dying. His wife took him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for emergency treatment, but his injuries were too severe and the treatment was ineffective. He died at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The deceased's wife reported the situation to the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to investigate and reported it to the headquarters for record.</p>
<h3>Forced to Hang Himself</h3>
<p>Xue Renyu, a Yancheng native who lived in a thatched house next to No. 13, Lane 672, Gonghexin Road, Zhabei, usually made a living by working. Because he was heavily indebted recently, unable to make ends meet, and was forced by creditors, he was unable to repay. He suddenly hanged himself behind people's backs the day before yesterday. The deceased's wife discovered it and tried to save him with artificial respiration, but it was too late. As a result, he died. The situation was reported to police officer No. 30 of the Fourth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which reported it to District Chief Gong Xikui, who dispatched police to investigate and ordered the local bailiff to apply to the local court for an examination of the corpse and burial.</p>
<h3>After the Robbery at Li Xiamao's House</h3>
<h3>Continuous Extortion Letters Received</h3>
<p>"Write 'Make Money for Me' at the Door"</p>
<p>One bandit was arrested in front of the Great World. Li Xiamao's house at No. 1, Daqing Lane, Rongji Road, Laobaidu, Pudong, was robbed unsuccessfully at 9:00 PM on June 9 of this year. At that time, Li's partner, Du Shenghong, was shot in the buttocks, but fortunately it was not fatal. On the 27th of this month, Li Xiamao received an extortion letter signed Gong Ziliang, demanding 3,000 yuan and claiming that the robbery on the 9th was also done by them. It ended by saying that if he agreed, he should write "Make Money for Me" in red paper and paste it on the cement wall opposite the Tongxing Teahouse in Laobaidu within three days of receiving the letter. Li Xiamao pasted it as instructed and noted the address agreed upon in the letter. On the 3rd of this month, another letter came, agreeing on a code and instructing Li to send an accountant, Bai Xiaochun, to Sichuan Road Bridge at 9:00 AM on the 5th of this month to negotiate. When Bai arrived at the Great World, a man named Zhu Changlin asked Bai if he had brought the money. Bai said he had not. Then a man named Li Changgen followed up. After negotiations, they agreed to meet again at the original location on the 7th. Li Xiamao received a total of three extortion letters and reported them to the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which ordered team leader Gu Liancheng to disguise himself with detectives such as Shen Jinchu and go to the address. When the bandit representative Li Changgen and Li Xiamao's representative Bai Xiaochun were negotiating, the detectives stepped forward and arrested Li Changgen (the others all escaped) and escorted him to the team, who explained the situation to the Third Section and transferred him to the local court for investigation. It has been reported before. It is now known that the case has been clearly preliminarily examined by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, who believes that the defendant Li Changgen has committed crimes such as Article 1, Section 2, and Section 12 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. Therefore, in accordance with Article 253, Section 1, and Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution was filed according to law. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Judge Shao Qinzhi took the seat in the Fifth Court and ordered the detained Li Changgen to be brought to the case for interrogation. Li Changgen stated that he had been serving at the Mitsubishi Company pier. A friend named Zhu Changlin had previously borrowed dozens of yuan from me. When I asked him to return it, Zhu said that he was also owed money by a friend and asked me to go with him to collect it. If he succeeded, he would return it all. I believed it was true and did not know the inside story. At this point, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang made a statement, and the lawyer Xue Lisheng, hired by the defendant, rose to defend him, stating briefly: The defendant Li Changgen in this case has a legitimate occupation. His arrest and the legal provisions and criminal acts alleged by the prosecutor are not true. Moreover, Bai Xiaochun from the victim's side had previously testified in court that the defendant was not present at the scene of the robbery. The handwriting was also verified in court for the letters of intimidation. The defendant is indeed illiterate, and the statement that Gong Ziliang is Li Changgen is unfounded. After research, the various facts clearly show that he was being fooled by others. He requested the court to declare him innocent. The judge deemed the debate closed and set the 28th for the verdict to be announced. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

The four suspects involved in the case of the robbery of 12,000 yuan from the office of Accountant Schmalz on Avenue Edward VII, Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, were arrested by the French police. After being interrogated by the Special Second Local Court, they were declared innocent. During the appeal period, Zhang was ordered to be temporarily detained in the detention center, while Zhuang, Wang, and Tang were allowed to post bail and wait for instructions. Later, the Police Department appealed to the High Third Branch Court, which had already opened an investigation court for interrogation. Zhang Zuming, who was detained, coughed up blood and developed heatstroke, and his health was failing. He petitioned to stop the detention and post bail for interrogation. The High Court ruled that he was allowed to post a 10,000 yuan guarantee and provide guarantees from three substantial shops. This has been reported before. Now Zhang's family has requested Tian Hexiang, Guo Chunfu, Ying Weiqing, and other responsible shareholders from Yuxianglong at No. 13 Yidel Lane, Laobeimen Street, French Concession, Yuanli at No. 204-205 Minquan Road, and Licheng at No. 207 on the same road, to issue a statement and stamp to request bail. The High Court accepted the statement and dispatched police to verify it. Yesterday, the three guarantors were summoned to the court. At noon, Judge Sun Helin opened the court to question the guarantors and explained the case. Tian, Guo, and Ying all stated that they were willing to be responsible for guaranteeing that Zhang Zuming would be available whenever summoned. The court ruled that the guarantees were approved and issued a release warrant. However, during the summer vacation afternoon, Zhang is expected to be released from prison this morning.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Zhengtai Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory has been in operation for seven years, boasting a large scale and being a leader in the domestic rubber industry. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the factory's first manufacturing plant in February of last year, causing a steam tank explosion and nearly insurmountable losses. However, with the maintenance and financial assistance of Liu Yongkang, Zhang Maolin, and others, the factory was thoroughly reorganized this spring. Xue Mingsan was hired as the manager. In recent months, Mr. Xue has been applying scientific methods to actively reorganize manufacturing and sales, resulting in significant progress that has been admired by peers. Mr. Xue is also very concerned about the health of the workers. He has conducted special research on the degree of worker fatigue and stipulated appropriate work-rest schedules. Thus, those who used to work tirelessly all day are now given a certain amount of rest every two hours. However, the work performance has not only not declined but has actually increased, which is truly interesting. Mr. Xue is a graduate of the Economics Department of National Tsinghua University. He has innovative ideas and does not follow the beaten path, always having unique insights, which have been praised by his peers. Furthermore, before entering university, Mr. Xue worked in a bank handling industrial and commercial affairs for many years, achieving remarkable results. Therefore, although Mr. Xue's graduation from university was relatively recent, his experience in handling affairs is very rich. Now that the factory has hired him as manager, the future development is immeasurable. China</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Commercial Art Writers Association</h3>
<p>The production of commercial art is closely related to the development of industry and commerce. Chinese commercial art producers have never had a formal group to discuss improvements and are scattered in all directions, which is extremely disorganized. Now, commercial art producers from major companies in Shanghai have initiated the organization of a Commercial Art Writers Association, which held its inaugural meeting on the 17th of this month at the New World Restaurant. Wang Yichang, Xu Minzhi, Lu Xin, Xiao Jianqing, He Yiming, Kuang Sheng, Wu Langxuan, Zheng Ruliang, Xue Ping from Wing On Company, Zhao Zixiang, Xu Jinrong, and Liu Guan from Sincere Company, Ke Dingshe and Chen Shijun from China National Goods Company, Lin Weiru, Zhu Mei from Taikang Company, Yan Ciping from Tianchu MSG Factory, Chen Qingru from China Book Company, Ming Zhongbiao from Dalu Bao, and Hu Zhongfan from Da Wan Bao, among others, attended. The association's purpose is to connect commercial art writers, study the theory of practical commercial art, promote production techniques, develop Chinese industry and commerce, and protect the progress of commercial art writers. It will set up sections for exhibition, review, publication, research, books and documents, general affairs, and continue to solicit commercial art producers to join the association. The association will expand publicity, solicit members' works, hold public exhibitions, and seek a suitable address for the association. Currently, the temporary liaison office is located in the art department of the New World Company. Lawsuit against Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<h3>Zhang Shizhao and Others Defend the Defendants</h3>
<p>Since the rickshaw deflation incident occurred, the Public Works Department has successively arrested Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, He Linsen, Cang Gongsen, Xing Hongxi, Zheng Fazhu, and Zhu Shuqiao, the former principal of the Shanghai YMCA Middle School, and prosecuted them in the First Special District Court for the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 318 of the Criminal Law and the crime of destroying property under Article 382 of the same law. The second hearing was held last Saturday, and the trial was adjourned to continue at 9:00 AM this Thursday. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now it is learned that the defendants are represented by six lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Yu Chengxiu, Xiang Xun, Zhang Yifan, Yu Jiazhen, and Chen Changsheng, who will provide pro bono defense for Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, He Linsen, Cang Gongsen, and Xing Hongxi. Lawyer Fu Gang will represent Zheng Fazhu, and lawyers Wu Linkun and Yao Yongli will represent Zhu Shuqiao, and they will appear in court tomorrow morning to defend them. At that time, there will be a fierce debate between the two sides. Xinsheng News Agency reported that since the police arrested Zheng Fazhu, He Wushan, Zhu Shuqiao, Cang Wengong, and others, who instigated the forced deflation of rickshaws on the road, and filed a public prosecution, Zhu Shuqiao admitted in court that he was invited by Zhu Maocheng and Wang Zhiren, members of the Public Works Department's Vehicle Affairs Committee. The case is scheduled for retrial tomorrow. Because Zhu Maocheng and Wang Zhiren need to be summoned to testify, summonses were issued yesterday ordering Zhu and Wang to appear in court to testify. When asked for his opinion, he replied that since the Chinese people are being tried by a Chinese court under Chinese law, he will appear in court at that time to state his reasons. Furthermore, Chen Guoliang, the representative of the genuine rickshaw pullers, sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday requesting that the perpetrators be severely punished to maintain the livelihood of the workers.</p>
<h3>Middle School Student</h3>
<h3>Tricked into Fraudulently Obtaining Silk by Thugs</h3>
<p>Whether they were classmates is difficult to recall. Wang Jinshou, a 19-year-old from Jintan, is currently a student at a certain middle school. As school was about to start, he had just arrived in Shanghai from his hometown and was residing at 32 Anna King Road in the French Concession. A few days ago, while passing by the Xinkai River, he met a young man named Zhao Meiting, who claimed to have been Wang's classmate in elementary school. Since they had parted ways, it had been several years. They happened to meet again, and Zhao invited Wang to the playground. Wang, being an honest boy, went with Zhao. After playing, they agreed to meet again the next day. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Zhao and Wang met again at the City God Temple. After tea, Zhao invited Wang to go to Dacheng Silk Store on Fangbang Road to buy materials. When they arrived, Zhao selected two pieces of crepe and said to Wu Jizeng, the store clerk, that he needed to take the goods home and wait for his mother to decide. He temporarily asked his classmate, Mr. Wang, to wait here. The store clerk, seeing that he was a young student, did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, Zhao Meiting left and never returned. The store clerk asked Wang Jinshou for Zhao's address, but Wang replied that he did not know. They had met on the road, and whether they were classmates was difficult to recall. The store believed that Wang Jinshou was involved in fraudulently obtaining the goods and reported it to police officer Wei Lianqing, who detained him at the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. After interrogation by Director Liu, the case was deemed to involve the accusation of fraudulently obtaining goods and was transferred to the Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>

The association has now notified all organizing committee members to receive the previous association's files at 3:00 PM on August 14.

<h3>Achievements of the Salt Affairs Audit Office Last Year</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the General Audit Office of Salt Affairs, the total amount of salt released nationwide in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, excluding Liaoning, was approximately 38 million dan in sima weight. This is an increase of over 1.4 million dan in sima weight compared to the previous year. The total salt tax revenue nationwide last year amounted to over 160 million yuan in national currency, an increase of over 14 million yuan compared to the previous year. The total expenditure of the three agencies of salt affairs audit, administration, and anti-smuggling nationwide, including the cost of construction projects such as ropeway construction, river dredging, and road building, was approximately 17 million yuan in national currency, a decrease of approximately 140,000 yuan compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Last year, there were bankruptcies in rural areas domestically and commercial decline. In the south, bandit suppression was hampered by the occupation of bandits, resulting in a ban on salt supply to bandit areas. In the north, there was encroachment from inland local salt and lightly taxed Liaoning salt. These factors had a significant impact on salt industry tax revenues, and salt sales were bound to decrease gradually. Fortunately, due to effective reforms and dedicated staff, there was an increase in the amount of salt released and tax collected, as mentioned above. The most significant increase in salt release and tax revenue occurred in the ten districts where the administrative and anti-smuggling agencies had been merged and were concurrently managed by the audit agencies. This was because unified authority made reform easier.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the important reforms implemented by the Audit Office last year:</p>
<p>(1) Simplified Procedures: Since the reorganization of the Salt Affairs Audit Office in the 18th year, the Ministry of Finance has been determined to make improvements, stipulating that the audit agencies should be responsible for preventing private salt sales (this point is of great importance, as smuggled private salt accounts for at least 40% of the total salt sales). Salt affairs administration was also concurrently managed by Chinese audit officials. The ten districts of Shandong, Huaibei, Huainan, Songjiang, Liangzhe, and both banks of the Yangtze River were selected for pilot projects. Procedures for the management of salt production and distribution, and the collection of salt taxes, were simplified as much as possible, benefiting both merchants and the government.</p>
<p>(2) Elimination of Malpractices: After the administrative agencies of the four banks of the Yangtze River (Salt Transportation Bureau) were merged into the audit agencies in the 21st year (Audit Office), all previous arbitrary fees and illegal levies collected by the Salt Transportation Bureau were eliminated. In all salt districts where administrative and anti-smuggling powers were taken over by the mountain audit agencies, accumulated malpractices and various other price regulations were completely abolished in the 22nd year. These malpractices and accumulated problems had been in place for a long time and were difficult to eradicate, but they were eliminated completely in the shortest period. This demonstrates the integrity and dedication of the audit personnel. Regulations were also established to reorganize the National Refined Salt Company, requiring them to re-register and use the amount of salt transported as a standard to ensure accuracy and prevent abuses.</p>
<p>(3) Improvement of Anti-Smuggling: Reorganizing and streamlining anti-smuggling officers and soldiers is a crucial step in preventing tax evasion by the Audit Office. The anti-smuggling officers and soldiers currently under the jurisdiction of the Audit Office number over 20,000. After the anti-smuggling teams in the ten districts, including Ziyoudong, were reorganized into tax police, all unqualified officers and soldiers were eliminated. In addition, tax police training schools were established in places such as Songjiang to intensify training, and senior instructors were dispatched to various locations to supervise. All regulations related to improving anti-smuggling efficiency were strictly enforced, ensuring strict military discipline and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>(4) Consolidation of Tax Rates: Tax rates in various districts have historically varied. Adjustments were made according to the circumstances, gradually moving towards uniformity to prevent lightly taxed salt from encroaching on heavily taxed areas.</p>
<p>(5) Changes in Salt Sales Methods in the Four Banks: The selling price of Huai salt sold in the four banks of the Yangtze River was determined by the government and called the "market price." Salt sales were based on the order of arrival at the sales banks, following a sequential rotation system that had been in place for a long time. Due to these restrictions, Huai merchants were unable to compete freely, resulting in accumulation and declining sales. A new and flexible method was adopted, allowing the selling price of Huai salt to be freely reduced below the standard legal price at both the production site and sales banks to facilitate sales. Sales offices were designated at specific locations, allowing transporters to sell their salt through the sales offices without being subject to rotation restrictions, aiming to regulate and promote sales.</p>
<p>(6) Construction of Salt Storage Yards: The fundamental plan for developing salt production involves constructing and organizing transportation infrastructure and storage yards. Construction in the salt production areas of Huaibei District has been completed and has proven effective. Other districts such as Shandong, Huainan, Liangzhe, Songjiang, and Guangdong have also followed suit, formulating yard construction plans and gradually starting work.</p>
<p>(7) Expansion of Sales Banks: The Audit Office made efforts to expand the scope of salt sales last year. For example, salt transport in Shaanxi Province was extremely sluggish. To benefit the people and increase tax revenue, it was approved to establish the Shaanxi Salt Tax Bureau. After negotiations with the provincial authorities, it was officially established in October of last year. It is also planned to establish salt affairs audit agencies in the northwestern provinces, with Lanzhou as the center, and preparations are currently underway.</p>
<p>In summary, the Salt Affairs Audit Office has a comprehensive plan for reforming salt affairs. The various reforms of the past year, especially the merger of agency powers, which was previously considered impossible to implement, have been carried out without obstruction. The fundamental reform plans can be summarized as follows: (1) Implementing management of salt production areas, (2) Equalizing tax rates nationwide, (3) Improving transportation routes, and (4) Increasing the efficiency of tax police, aiming to achieve the ultimate goal of collecting taxes at the production site. If salt affairs powers are fully unified, the political situation is stable, and various reforms can be implemented smoothly, then it is possible to increase tax revenue by 50 to 60 million yuan per year based on the population's salt consumption.</p>
<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<h3>Several Questions from Books</h3>
<p>——Answer to Mr. Ye Lanpu</p>
<p>Recently, many readers have been able to raise many detailed and systematic questions about the books they read, which proves that everyone's enthusiasm for reading has greatly increased. For example, last time, Mr. Du Luoji raised more than sixty questions in the book "Materialism Tutorial," and now Mr. Ye Lanpu has raised more than twenty questions in the book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State." A dozen or twenty questions have also been raised in the books "Women and the Church" and "Ancient Society." Readers' efforts are not only very gratifying and moving, but also allow us to discover many errors and difficulties in books that we have not paid attention to, and these errors and difficulties will be encountered by all readers. Therefore, we will select the most important of these questions for public publication. Last time, in the topic "Errors and Difficulties in Translations," we publicly answered twenty or thirty of Mr. Du's questions. Now we will answer Mr. Ye's questions in the book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State" one by one:</p>
<p>Question: (According to Morgan's description here, the evolution of mankind from savagery and barbarism to the beginning of civilization is undeniable because it is directly described from production. But if we compare this picture with the panorama that unfolds before our eyes at the end of our study, it will show a poor and dim appearance.) (Page 36) How to explain this passage?</p>
<p>Answer: This means that Morgan uses human production to explain the evolution of human society from savagery to barbarism and civilization, which is a very correct method. However, what is said is only a general description, and after careful study, we feel that the general description is not enough.</p>
<p>Question: (Furthermore, if strict monogamy is considered the supreme morality, then the coconut leaf (symbol of victory - translator) should belong to the tapeworm, because in its fifty or even one hundred segments, there is a complete set of reproductive organs, and it engages in its own intercourse in each segment throughout its life) (Page 44) What does this mean? What is the meaning of the symbol of victory?</p>
<p>Answer: Coconut is the name of a tree, and its leaves are regarded as a symbol of victory by Western Europeans. (Symbol of victory) means the representative of victory. This means that if strict monogamy (that is, a woman does not marry two husbands, and a man does not marry two wives) is the supreme morality, then victory belongs to the tapeworm, because each segment has a complete set of male and female reproductive organs, and each engages in its own intercourse throughout its life.</p>
<p>Question: (Therefore, when it comes to animal marriage, we must return to the point that we should always leave.) (Page 48) How to explain this sentence? Which point is it? Leave what?</p>
<p>Answer: It means that human marriage is different from animal marriage. Animal marriage often destroys group life due to jealousy, but human primitive marriage overcomes jealousy for the sake of social necessity, resulting in group marriage. (That point) refers to the destruction of group life.</p>
<p>Question: (Since then, we have known several other forms of group marriage, and now we feel that Morgan has gone to extremes in this regard.) (Page 61) How to explain this sentence?</p>
<p>Answer: Morgan believes that group marriage inevitably precedes pair marriage and is generally prevalent. According to Engels' research, there were other transitional forms of marriage before pair marriage existed. Therefore, it is felt that Morgan's claim is excessively biased in this regard.</p>
<p>Question: From the sentence (In the superficial observer) on page 64 to the sentence (In fact, a strict law is being followed) on page 65, how to explain this passage?</p>
<p>Answer: This passage explains that the laws of group marriage still exist during the time of polygamy. Such as (the matter of sleeping with a wife for his guests). (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Welcoming People and Biting People</h3>
<p>— Yue Qiao</p>
<p>Reports say that in a certain village in Shaoxing, farmers were welcoming gods and praying for rain because of the drought. When they saw a spectator wearing a hat, they beat him violently with knives and sticks.</p>
<p>This is superstition, but it has a basis. Dong Zhongshu, a Confucian scholar of the Han Dynasty, had a method of praying for rain, such as using widows, closing city gates, and creating a smoky atmosphere, which was as strange as the Taoists, but it has not been corrected by modern Confucian scholars. Even in large cities, there are still Taoist priests performing rituals and officials banning slaughter, causing a great uproar. Has anyone ever raised any objections? As for hitting the hat, it is because they are afraid of seeing someone still carefree and not showing sympathy, and they also hate that person for not sharing their suffering.</p>
<p>The farmers' original intention in welcoming the gods was to save the dying—but unfortunately it is superstition—but other than that, they do not know any other way.</p>
<p>The report also says that an old party member in his sixties came out to dissuade the welcoming of gods and was beaten by everyone, eventually having his throat bitten off and dying.</p>
<p>This is blind faith, but it also has a basis. "The Complete Biography of Yue Fei" says that Zhang Jun framed loyal officials and was eventually bitten to death by the crowd, which greatly pleased the people. Therefore, there has always been a legend in the countryside that the emperor will pardon anyone who bites someone to death. I do not know the law, but I am afraid that there may not be such a provision in the laws before the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The farmers' original intention in biting people was to escape death—but unfortunately it is blind faith—but other than that, they do not know any other way.</p>
<p>Wanting to save the dying, wanting to escape death, actually accelerates their death, alas!</p>
<p>Since the empire became the Republic of China, there have been many changes at the upper level, but the uneducated farmers have not received anything new or beneficial. They are still trapped in the old superstitions and old false rumors, desperately trying to save the dying and escape death, thus accelerating their own deaths.</p>
<p>This time, they will receive divine punishment. They will be afraid, but because they do not understand the reason for divine punishment, they will also be resentful. When this fear and resentment are forgotten, only superstition and false rumors will remain. When the next drought or flood comes, it will still be welcoming gods and biting people.</p>
<p>When will this tragedy end?</p>
<h3>Gorky's Opinion</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>—To Prevent Literature from Dying is a Great Disaster</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of building popular language is to build popular culture. Pure popular culture must of course wait for the masses to build it themselves, but before the masses have this power, cultural workers for the masses must find ways to give them this power and cultivate them into cultural workers. There are two forces that provide the best assistance in cultivating cultural people: science and art. Gorky once discussed this matter, believing that (along with natural science, although not above it, nor below it, the powerful means of influencing the intellect and will of mankind are the art of literature. Almost no one denies this, right?) But he believed that there are still people who deny this, that is: (On one hand, they preach the formula of historical materialism (life constitutes consciousness), but on the other hand, they cannot see and do not believe that this consciousness has the power to create new activities.) Originally, those who are superstitious about science, technology, and literature and shout (prevent literature from dying, the great disaster will not stop) are not only our Mr. Wu Zhihui. In the article (The Working Class Should Cultivate Cultural Workers), Gorky criticized people like him. I will now copy two paragraphs of this article here for everyone to see. Perhaps it will be helpful in evaluating Mr. Wu's theory?</p>
<p>Gorky said: (In our country, the educational significance of literature is not well evaluated, no, to be precise, it is not evaluated at all, especially in the local areas. For example, the editor of the local newspaper (Soviet Siberia) Kolles - who is said to have been an anarchist - organized the persecution of literature, and also Panklusin, one of his supporters, declared that (the art of literature is essentially reactionary.) This is undoubtedly a rural-style interpretation of the theory of the late (Lev) (Left Front of Art). From my point of view - not a partial point of view, but a point of view that has come from observing the revolutionary educational significance of literature for more than fifty years, and that I am still observing now - Panklusin is not only a shallow-minded young man, but also someone I can call an unconscious (poisoner) in the field of cultural undertakings. Also, there was originally no literary column in the newspaper, but this person declared to the literary members: (The Party and Soviet authorities will not provide paper for publishing poems and novels). In this way, the literary column was abolished.</p>
<p>(Comrade Romov published a short essay (Five-Year Plan for Non-Party Cultural Undertakings) in a magazine in our country. As is often seen in the essays of young critics, there are many quotations in this essay, and these quotations are also used to prove that the National Publishing Association's printing of classical works is harmful to the working class. But I think this critic, besides quotations, probably needs to know something else. For example, something like a library newspaper report should be known - in this report, the affirmative attitude of the working masses towards the works of old writers can be seen in numbers. Also, is it really questionable whether Comrade Romov can prove that (Boris Godunov), (Serfs), Balzac's (Peasants), Chekhov's (Farmers), Pomilovsky's (Happiness of City People), Bunin's (Rural Areas), and hundreds of other such factual novels about the recent past are harmful to workers? The richness and unfoundedness of Romov-style, Panklusin-style, and Gengin-style subjective evaluations only serve to promote the chaos of language and only make the progress of that near road to the fixed goal of cultivating cultural workers from among the working masses anarchic.)</p>
<p>According to Gorky, even some works in past classical literature may not be harmful to the masses. This is the principle of (accepting heritage). But let's put this aside for now. In short, what I want to tell you is how Gorky criticized the views of those who opposed literature in Russia.</p>
<h3>(Evolution) and (Enslavement)</h3>
<p>— Nie Zhi</p>
<p>Is (Westernization) necessary? Should (national essence) be preserved? The answers to these questions can only be relative, not absolute. The key lies in determining the standard of choice based on its own (timely value). That is to say, whoever meets the needs of the environment has the value of (adopting) and (preserving); whoever becomes a historical obstacle, or is far from timely to replace (today) with (tomorrow), can only be sent to the historical museum or put into the reserve team. However, the earth is round, and (super-time) often merges with (out-of-date), just like the trams on Route 6, which will still go in the original direction after going down the diameter. Therefore, does (Westernization) promote Western aggression? Will (national essence) poison the Chinese people? It all depends on grasping the trend of (historical evolution) to make a judgment: (survival of the fittest, elimination of the unfit), no one can escape this law of natural syllogism!</p>
<p>Handicraft is generally regarded as (national essence). In the present time, do we advocate preserving handicrafts or adopting (Westernized) mechanical industry? Most people, as long as they are not idiots, understand that the (backwards-driving) handicraft industry cannot find an economic outlet. Continuing to preserve it will only be poisoned to death! (In fact, even if you want to preserve it, you will not be allowed to preserve it.) Then should we adopt mechanical industry? Machinery is in foreign countries, and importing it has the suspicion of (Westernization), intentionally or unintentionally promoting Western aggression. So what should we do? Should we (stop eating because of choking) and not want mechanical industry at all? It won't work! We should distinguish clearly: (evolution) is one thing, and (enslavement) is another. That is to say, if (national essence) is really backward compared to (Western essence), then we have no choice but to adopt it. Don't believe it! Point out a few examples: Wasn't the first train on the Wusong Railway sent into the sea by the national essence gentlemen? What is it like now? I am afraid that the national essence gentlemen would feel inconvenient without a train - electric lights and tap water are all (imported goods). Speaking from the perspective of national essence, they should be eliminated as soon as possible, but today, the followers of Zhang Tianshi of Longhu Mountain also rely on colorful electric lights when performing rituals; the (Xuanmiao Temple) and (Gongdelin) of Buddhists eat and use nothing but tap water. What is this? Could it be that the typical figures who advocate preserving national essence today are more advanced than the followers of the Zhang school and Buddhists?</p>
<p>It can be seen that evolution cannot be hindered, and the backward can only catch up. Regardless of whether it is (Westernization) or (Asianization).</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about (enslavement). There are several explanations for slavery: A is dominated by B, tolerates humiliation, and obeys orders, which is of course A being a slave of B; however, if humans cannot utilize nature and are instead conquered by nature everywhere: floods in the year of Yin, droughts in the year of Mao, earthquakes followed by hurricanes, then it can also be said that humans have become slaves of nature. Becoming a slave of humans is originally not right, and humans becoming slaves of nature is also not right. Therefore, it is (enslavement) for oppressed nations to willingly accept the exploitation of imperialism, and it is also (enslavement) to advocate restoring the past and not utilizing nature. Understanding this level, what problems are there? For example, forcibly learning Westernization in writing style, making it difficult for readers to understand, is the crime of the (learner), and evolutionary (Westernization) itself is not to blame; however, some people, because they (learn improperly), advocate restoring the past and bringing out the living corpses of classical Chinese to show off, which is tantamount to opposing (high heels) and advocating (foot binding). This kind of (national essence) should not be preserved and should be opposed.</p>

<h3>Escape Notes (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>The countryside should be something to be missed, but today, mentioning it brings some terrifying impressions.</p>
<p>Living in her house during the spring break, I simply forgot that I was a guest and only felt that the days were passing too happily. Aunt Xu's son was getting engaged tomorrow and asked me to write big red double happiness characters. She was really happy from the bottom of her heart and even invited me to eat happiness noodles tomorrow. It was this afternoon that the sound of cars on the highway never stopped. (Liu Hei Qi is coming soon!) Before, it was just rumors, but due to the proof of these military vehicles, it was really (coming soon!) Auntie was desperately packing things, from photos and clocks to broken leather shoes, and transporting them in baskets to a small house in the back. She was covered in sweat. I was used to seeing this kind of work, and I had even laughed at it in secret, but at this time, I became her assistant because I had listened to her long experience talk once, and I felt that this time of packing was really not too much of a panic.</p>
<p>(Wake up more at night!) This was Auntie's warning to us. At night, our eyes slept, but our hearts were half awake. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, she woke me up, tilted her ear, and said in a panic (Listen, blowing the bugle!) (What bugle, it's the rooster crowing!) I laughed, and she finally relieved the fear on her face.</p>
<p>(Quick, get up!) Auntie came in, pushing the door open. (Go quickly!) She turned around and went out again. At this time, it was not yet dawn, and it was drizzling. The two of us stood like wooden chickens outside the front door. (Knock knock!) Someone jumped over the west wall. Sister-in-law Liu also ran over from the back house. She led me from a hole in the wall of the women's toilet to Liu Ma's house next door. There were no adults in the house, and two little girls were sleeping soundly. The two of us climbed onto the kang and comforted each other by stubbornly saying that we were not afraid, which was really a way of deceiving ourselves.</p>
<p>Liu Ma came in. She said there was no need to be afraid, it was probably soldiers, buying and selling publicly on the street. Her words were naturally not lies, because she was taking care of the buying and selling in front of the door. However, no one dared to guarantee whether her observation was correct. A burst of (Go quickly) urged us to hide in this small house, but we had no way of knowing what the facts were. I only felt a sense of happiness at having escaped danger at the moment of climbing over the wall hole.</p>

<p>X X X</p>
<p>In whose heart float strands of sorrow, in the netherworld trail wisps of lingering fragrance—from a desolate autumn night, drifted a withered flower to a desolate land.</p>
<h3>Old Man (10)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>(That's it, old man, I was really afraid I'd lost it, it was so hard to find.)</p>
<p>Yalisai was so happy he almost cried, handing the printed item to his hand. It had a copperplate portrait on it, with two or three lines of English explanation below.</p>
<p>(Look, isn't this Shasha? How handsome he is, I knew this young man would be amazing!)</p>
<p>He looked at it carefully, and although the person in the portrait had neatly combed hair and wore a gentleman's suit, he could tell at a glance that it was Shasha, who had left him two years ago.</p>
<p>(His expression is really good, his eyes are so bright...)</p>
<p>He only thought this in his heart and didn't say it out loud. Moreover, at this time, he felt that his mouth had become clumsy (and seemed to be trembling a little), and even if he wanted to speak, he might not be able to say a word. He stared at the portrait as if nailed to the spot, his eyes sparkling with youthful vigor; his heart was filled with joy, and his eyes were covered with layers of tears. His hand trembled slightly.</p>
<p>After a long while, he asked with great difficulty, stammering:</p>
<p>(You! You, know what these words below say?)</p>
<p>(How could I understand English? Today I even asked two customers, and they didn't understand either.)</p>
<p>He nodded, but didn't look up, speaking to Yalisai.</p>
<p>(Where did you find it?)</p>
<p>(I bought it from the old paper shop to wrap beef. Don't you remember I always use a lot of old newspapers? Shasha used to love going to my place to find illustrated magazines. One day, an old woman came to my place to buy a (portion of) (note) of beef, and I casually took a piece of paper to wrap it for her, and saw this picture. I took another piece to wrap it for her, and kept this one, always thinking of bringing it to you to see. Shasha, this child, seems to be doing well outside.)</p>

<p>(1) Tsinghua University: This school's physical education facilities have a long history and have benefited from the enthusiastic management of those in charge of physical education, resulting in its current excellent achievements. This school's physical education equipment and faculty have a considerable foundation. In the future, it should, within its economic capacity, consider the domestic situation, widely adopt the strengths of various European and American countries, and improve at any time. It should also conduct research on specialized physical education problems (such as examining the progress of students' physical fitness in school and comparing students' physical education performance after entering school with that at the time of initial enrollment) to seek the development of physical education that is suitable for the national conditions. However, the school's physical education funding still needs to be appropriately secured to facilitate progress, and teachers should be added for female students to be responsible for guidance. Furthermore, the school's physical education forms, which have been used for a long time, still use English. In the future, they should all be changed to Chinese. (2) Normal University: In recent years, this school's physical education facilities have been able to pay attention to popularization, but the physical education field equipment is quite insufficient, which greatly hinders students' extracurricular sports. Funds should be allocated to expand it quickly. Furthermore, the school's dormitory bathrooms and toilets are all rather old and urgently need to be improved to emphasize hygiene. (3) Peking University: The school's proposed physical education development plan, which includes physical education as a required course, should be implemented as soon as possible. As for the various physical activity testing methods, it can refer to those used by Nankai, Tsinghua, and Wuhan Universities, and then consider the school's situation and formulate appropriate standards to seek practicality. The school's physical education equipment is still insufficient and should be strengthened. The construction of a gymnasium is also urgently needed and should be realized according to the original plan. Furthermore, the school's female physical education should add teachers to be responsible for guidance. (4) Beiping University: This school's physical education organization is governed by individual colleges, without concrete plans and steps. It wastes financial resources and yields few results. In the future, a physical education director should be set up to preside over the overall physical education design matters for the entire school, and each college should appoint a physical education instructor to specialize in promotion, and convene meetings from time to time to discuss matters that should be initiated and reformed in physical education to seek joint progress. The physical education facilities of each college and the points that should be improved are listed below. (1) Law College: Because there are full-time personnel responsible for promotion, the physical education facilities have considerable achievements. However, the number of championship competitions held in the future should be appropriately reduced, and physical activities that are universally participated in by all students should be promoted as much as possible, and the physical education funding should be fixed at a certain amount to facilitate progress. The original College of Commerce's physical education was very simple, and the equipment and funding were insufficient. Now that it has been merged into the college, the Law and Commerce College should earnestly improve in the future. (2) Engineering College: Students have a strong interest in extracurricular physical education activities, but the college's physical education instructors are all part-time, and they inevitably shirk responsibility when things happen, and no one is responsible for guiding female students. A full-time physical education teacher should be hired immediately to take full responsibility. In terms of equipment, a track and field field should be added. (3) Agricultural College: Students' physical education activities are quite serious, especially in national arts. However, the physical education instructors rarely come to the college, and they have not done their best to promote physical education. In the future, attention should be paid to hiring physical education instructors. (4) Medical College: The physical education field is small, there are no full-time physical education teachers, and the equipment fee is also small. In the future, full-time personnel should be hired to be responsible for planning, and appropriate funding should be allocated to actively expand equipment. Furthermore, the college's bathroom is now dilapidated and should be repaired as soon as possible to emphasize hygiene. As for the proposed future physical education development plan, efforts should be made to realize it. (5) Women's Liberal Arts College: Ordinary physical education equipment is insufficient, and physical education major equipment is particularly lacking. Physical education funding should be appropriately allocated to increase equipment. The college's student dormitory is not clean enough, and the bathroom facilities are insufficient and the opening hours are very short. Improvements should be made quickly to emphasize hygiene. Furthermore, the college's physical education major has too few full-time teachers and should be added, and the curriculum should also be enriched. (5) Northeastern University: Students at this school practice physical activities quite diligently, and student life is usually managed in a military manner, and discipline is also strict. However, physical education funding must be appropriately fixed at a considerable amount, and equipment must also be expanded to facilitate development. Furthermore, the school's sanitary facilities, such as bathrooms and toilets, are not complete and clean enough and should be improved to emphasize hygiene. (6) Yenching University: This school pays attention to physical education, but recently, due to financial and talent difficulties, part of the physical education curriculum has been suspended. In the future, efforts should be made to restore it. The school's male physical education activities are mostly organized by students autonomously. This spirit of autonomy is commendable, but the school authorities must still bear the responsibility of presiding over the design and guide and promote it from a positive perspective. The school's female physical education organization is more strict, and the recent promotion of health exercises is also well-intentioned, but attention must be paid to domestic customs and economic conditions. The female swimming pool has been completed and should be used as soon as possible. Furthermore, the school's physical education regulations and forms use both Chinese and English, and some use only English. In the future, they should all be changed to Chinese. (7) Fu Jen University: The school's physical education administrative organization is too complicated and should be improved quickly to increase efficiency. Physical education funding should be secured to facilitate the establishment of facilities. Furthermore, the school's physical education has been too focused on the competition of a few people, which is inappropriate. In the future, efforts should be made to popularize it to seek the development of physical education activities for all students. (8) Sino-French University: Except for the College of Social Sciences, the physical education fields of each college are small, the physical education funding is insufficient, and the equipment is simple. Students' sports activities are not active. In the future, funding should be appropriately increased, and fields and equipment should be expanded to seek development. Furthermore, the physical education teachers of each college are all part-time and have not been able to wholeheartedly plan physical education facilities. Full-time personnel should be hired immediately to be responsible for guidance. (9) Chaoyang College: Students at this college can autonomously organize various gatherings to seek technical progress, which is commendable. However, the school should actively guide and take responsibility for management and supervision to enhance students' interest in physical education. Furthermore, the college has more than 1,700 students, but only the physical education director and two physical education teachers are responsible for physical education guidance. The physical education teachers also have to teach physical education to the affiliated middle school, so guidance and management are difficult to be thorough. In the future, teachers should be added to facilitate progress, and a physical education teacher should be set up for female students to guide them. Furthermore, the college's physical education field, although large, needs to be organized to make it suitable for use. (10) Xiehe Medical College: Students at this college are still interested in sports activities, but only one female teacher is responsible for physical education. It is necessary to plan the overall situation thoroughly on a voluntary basis. Personnel should be added to assist in the process. The extracurricular activities of the college's physical education, tennis and skating, are quite common. In the future, other activities should also be promoted in many ways. Furthermore, the percentage of physical education equipment fees is too small and should be increased to enrich various physical education equipment. (11) Railway College: The college's physical education facilities are too focused on competitions, which is inappropriate. In the future, universal sports should be promoted so that all students participate. The college's physical education equipment is still insufficient and should be gradually increased. The track and field field is too spacious and difficult to manage and should be reorganized. Furthermore, the college's plan to add a sheltered sports field and bathroom is indeed a key plan. However, building dormitories specifically for players in order to train is too much emphasis on athletes and neglects the universal development of physical education, which goes against the principle of promoting physical education. This plan should be stopped. (12) China College: This college's physical education lacks design work. The design in the future should aim at all students participating in various sports activities. The college's allocation of physical education funding is also inappropriate. In the future, equipment fees should be increased and other expenses should be reduced. Furthermore, the college's plan to improve physical education is too focused on equipment. Attention should also be paid to the steps and methods of popularizing physical education to all students. As for the plan to add a physical education department at once, it must not be opened without sufficient teachers, funding, and equipment, and with the approval of the Ministry. Yangtze River Natural Barrier</p>
<h3>Heroes Successfully Cross the River</h3>
<p>▲Twelve heroes participated and went south from here ▲Peng Xun arrived first amidst cheers from the crowd ▲No one failed to reach the finish line The electric school swimming team's Yangtze River crossing performance in Zhenjiang, which caused a sensation in the provincial capital, was held on the Ganlu Temple river surface yesterday afternoon. The weather was calm, the sun was shining, and the sky was clear, and the water temperature was appropriate, making it a very suitable day for swimming. The team had previously measured the diameter from Beigushan to the opposite Liuwei to be about 4,500 meters. Due to the current, the north bank was designated as the starting point. More than 30 people originally participated, but after strict review by instructor Jiang Baohe, Peng Dong, Fu Yan, and 12 others with strong physiques and excellent skills were selected to participate, and the rest were advised to give up to avoid danger in the middle. In order to obtain detailed information and improve people's understanding of swimming, the reporter rushed to Ganlu Temple to depart with the army.</p>
<h3>Rooster Crows at Noon</h3>
<p>After the twelve water heroes had a full meal, they were led by the instructor to prepare to depart. More than 100 members of the rescue team, divided into six sampans, were also ready to go. Half an hour later, the practice boat whistled and broke through the waves, dragging the sampans towards Liuwei. The head and tail were connected like a long snake. At about 2 o'clock, they arrived at a location about 300 meters east of Liuwei. The heroes took off their clothes and shoes, each drank a glass of wine to maintain their body temperature, and lined up in a row, standing on the boat. The commander shouted, and the sound of splashes was heard as they entered the water one after another. The six sampans closely followed, sometimes in front and sometimes behind, and the practice boat responded in all directions, all doing their best to protect them. However, the Yangtze River was turbulent, and after entering the water for about 1,000 meters, it was seen that the winners of the Yangtze River crossing swimming of the Leidian School (from right to left) were Second place Fu Yan, First place Peng Xun, and Third place Jia Qingrun.</p>
<h3>Black Shadows Here and There</h3>
<p>Shen Tu Zhao, Pan Ruzhou, and others had already floated down the river towards Jiaoshan. After the practice boat pointed out the direction, they returned to the official swimming line. Those who identified the target and moved forward, such as Peng Dong and Fu Yan, also formed an arc due to the excessive current, reaching the finish line at no less than 7,600 meters. At that time, the audience at the foot of Beigushan was already packed with people, and Zhongzheng Road was still crowded with people coming from all directions, with no less than 10,000 people, which shows the interest of people in the provincial capital in swimming. At 4 o'clock,</p>
<h3>Number Two Peng Xun</h3>
<p>arrived first, at the Guanyin Cave wharf under Ganlu Temple. The applause and cheers were like spring thunder. Soon, everyone arrived one after another. Although the results were slightly different, no one dropped out midway. Their brave and determined spirit is admirable. The results of the team members are listed below: (1) Peng Xun, 20 years old, from Guixi, Jiangxi, score 1 hour and 20 minutes; (2) Fu Yan, 25 years old, from Zhuji, Zhejiang, score 1 hour and 28 minutes; (3) Jia Qinglan, 26 years old, from Lixian, Hebei, score 1 hour and 35 minutes; (4) Jiang Yunbin, 20 years old, from Taixing, Jiangsu, score 1 hour and 43 minutes; (5) Hu Mengwei, 23 years old, from Yunyang, Sichuan, score 1 hour and 50 minutes; (6) Cao Ruping, 24 years old, from Nantong, Jiangsu, score 1 hour and 57 minutes; (7) Li Chongzhu, 19 years old, from Nanchang, Jiangxi, score 2 hours and 4 minutes; (8) Zhao Yunfei, 23 years old, from Yongshui, Hunan, score 2 hours and 5 minutes; (9) Huang Chonglin, 20 years old, from Ganzhou, Jiangxi, score 2 hours and 7 minutes; (10) Shen Tu Zhao, 23 years old, from Dongyang, Zhejiang, score 2 hours and 8 minutes; (11) Pan Ruzhou, from Funing, Jiangsu, score 2 hours and 10 minutes; (12) Fang Shiting, 21 years old, from Dongyang, Zhejiang, score 2 hours and 30 minutes. It is heard that the school will hold it again, and the entire team will participate at that time, which will be a grand occasion. (Ming) 8.21</p>
<h3>Sea Crossing Competition Held This Morning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gaoqiao 2,000-meter sea crossing competition, originally scheduled to be held on the 19th, was unable to be held due to strong winds and waves and broken ship chains, and was only a performance. Now, for the convenience of the Nanjing Jiulong Yangtze River United Team and the Hangzhou Changfeng Team to participate, it was agreed the day before yesterday that it will be held at 11:00 am today. Contestants who have previously registered are requested to take the 7:00 or 8:00 boat to the Gaoqiao Seaside Hotel this morning to gather for a joint departure. This time, there will be a small motorboat, a motorboat, and 24 lifebuoys to be prepared for emergencies.

<p>The Ministry of Education's proposal to establish a National Academic Work Advisory Office with the National Economic Commission has been passed for many days, but it has not yet been prepared.

It is also heard that the Ministry of Education plans to establish this advisory office at the end of this month. Beijing Normal University</p>
<h3>President Li Petitions the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>▲Regarding the suspension of the graduate school, Li Zheng, the president of Beijing Normal University, finished attending the annual meeting of the China Social Education Society in Kaifeng (it is said that the most important proposal of this year's annual meeting is to revitalize the nation through rural construction, and everyone has focused on this proposal and has agreed on principles, such as how to plan funding and train talents, etc.). On the 19th, he arrived in Beijing. On the morning of the 20th, he explained everything to the Ministry of Education regarding the suspension of the graduate school. Minister Wang happened to be going to Jiangxi and was received by Vice Minister Duan. Duan said that this matter had been reported by the inspectors, who believed that there was little performance and hoped that the Ministry would end it immediately and then handle it according to the regulations. President Li said that the graduate school attached to the school (now renamed the graduate school according to the new regulations of the Ministry) has been in existence for three years and is divided into three groups: one is for graduate students, with 12 students currently, who are required to complete the specified credits in two years and graduate after passing the corresponding examinations and writing a thesis (once the degree law is promulgated, this type of graduation can have a master's degree). The students in this class have only been studying for one year. The second is the Educational Problems Research Group, and the third is the Compilation Group. The researchers in these two groups are mostly graduates of the school's education and other departments who enter the school to seek further study. The professors guide the research. Although the previous achievements have not been great, they have already started working and will soon be fruitful, such as the educational survey of the entire city of Tianjin, which has been edited and sent to print and will be published within two months. Regarding the research and compilation of educational issues, such as the survey and research on education funding in various provinces and cities across the country, the compilation of textbooks for middle schools and normal schools in various subjects, the research on direct and mixed teaching of English, and the significance and facilities of mass education, much material has been collected and the research has considerable results, which will soon be made public to society. The Ministry is now promulgating research regulations, with the expectation that universities will establish graduate schools within three years. The graduate school of Beijing Normal University has been in existence for several years and provides opportunities for university students to study further, which seems very necessary, and it is hoped that it will be maintained. President Li also said that there are currently 12 graduate students, who will not graduate until next year, but it is difficult to stop them midway. In terms of funding, if the researchers in the Educational Research and Compilation groups are terminated, only one group of graduate students would require only 1,000 yuan. Vice Minister Duan said that this matter would be reviewed and decided after Minister Wang returns to Beijing. President Li will stay in Beijing temporarily and return to the school after meeting with Minister Wang. Second Batch</p>

<h3>The Department of Advanced Surveying Continues to Recruit New Students</h3>
<p>China severely lacks talent in advanced surveying. At this time, when we are striving for construction, it is most needed. Everything related to land consolidation, national defense deployment, transportation development, and mining development relies on surveying. Seeing this, Tongji University has added a Department of Advanced Surveying to the College of Engineering to cultivate specialized talent in this field to serve the country. In the first year, students will study German in Hangzhou. In the second year, they will intern at the Central Land Surveying School in Nanjing.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>First Chapter The Ghosts Carry a Cart from Guanzhong, and Every Family is Penniless. The Ferry Hangs the Qin People</p>
<p>This was a car used by German merchants, and it was not originally intended to carry passengers. The driver at Tongguan said to the German, "These two people are on the highway. Since you're here in the Northwest to do car business, how can you not connect with them?" The German thought that taking two people to Xi'an wouldn't consume much extra oil, and there was plenty of space, so he agreed to do a favor. The driver also said to Zhang and Li, "If you buy tickets on the passenger bus, it will cost six yuan per person. If you take this car, it will cost three yuan per person. If someone on the highway asks, we have a foreigner here, and I'll say it's a company and we'll pass." These two, in order to save half the price, followed the truck and sat in the highest-class seats. This Mr. Li Shilian, although he had contracted stamp duties in the inland of Jiangsu and served as a police officer, spent most of his days in Shanghai and had never suffered such hardship. Sitting in the gap between the wooden boxes, on a rolled-up bedding, the car flew, and the people swayed back and forth, left and right. If they fell out of the car, they would lose at least two-thirds of their lives if they didn't die. He dared not straighten his back, grabbed the front with both hands, and refused to let go of a net basket. There was no cover on top, and the sun in March was already quite strong. Although he wore a felt hat, it only covered half of his face. That was fine, but as long as the car stopped occasionally, or slowed down slightly, the yellow soil rolled up by the four wheels, with the wind, poured onto people without distinguishing between ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, cuffs and collars, like scattering nets and pouring water. He also knew that the Northwest was a place of simplicity, so he wore a blue cloth gown over his silk-lined robe. But after the yellow soil was poured over him, the blue cloth gown immediately turned into a dust cloth gown. He pulled out a white handkerchief from his pocket to dust off the dust. Wang Laowu from Tianjin saw this and said to him, "Why bother dusting off the dust? The dust will always be swept away before the car reaches the station." (Two)</p>
<h3>Autumn Talk</h3>
<p>— By Zhou Zixin</p>
<p>The temperature hasn't dropped, but in my heart, I have the idea that the fiery summer heat will soon disappear.</p>
<p>Autumn feels like the most pleasant season. Spring is too flamboyant, summer is too hot, and winter is too cold! Only autumn is suitable for the general season, so let's call it a popular season! It doesn't have flamboyant scenes to evoke general depression; it doesn't have hot sunshine to burn the skin; it doesn't have biting cold winds or frigid frost to oppress and exert power on the general populace.</p>
<p>Cicada! I'm really worried about you. Starting in the autumn, your lifespan is in danger. In the summer, you were so arrogant, singing lofty songs, looking down on everything. At that time, no one envied or praised you, but now, even if you deeply regret it, it may be a little late! You will inevitably be ridiculed by others.</p>
<p>Autumn, I really envy you, I really rejoice in you. I envy your picturesque scenery, and I rejoice in your pleasant weather. The old boy in my garden, with sharp ends, long oval leaves, and long petioles, has also been blown into mottled red and yellow patterns, which makes me often in love with it! It frees me from all the depression, and when I see the beautiful old boy, I think of your loveliness!</p>
<p>Autumn! I hope you will stay in the world forever and never pass away again. You are truly the season that the general populace clings to!</p>
<h3>Drops</h3>
<p>— (Cuckoo)</p>
<p>The ancient poet's line (Sweat drips beneath the soil) vividly describes the hardship of farmers working in the fields. This year, there is a severe drought in Jiangnan, with thousands of miles of red land. It's pitiful that they don't even have crops! All they have is sweat, tears, and blood!</p>
<h3>Duck Herding</h3>
<p>— By Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>From a cubic duck pen made of thatch and rice straw ropes, we ran to that place in the morning and afternoon. It was silent, quiet, and as indifferent as a tomb, with no life at all.</p>
<p>Ducks prefer water to drought. In the countryside, duck raising requires effort in herding. Every day, when the rooster first crows and the east spits out fish-belly white light, the duck herder opens the duck pen, and the hundreds and thousands of ducks run out, shaking their whole bodies to the sound of "ga-wu, ga-wu." By the stream and on the bank, the ducks move in the water with great discipline. The duck herder drives a small boat like a wooden bucket, and with a bamboo pole, advances through the constant sound of "ga-wu, ga-wu" and the water waves. The bamboo pole supports the boat, and when the ducks see the shadow of the pole, they are like donkeys grinding a mill when they see the shadow of the whip. They frantically shake their feet and paddle forward.</p>
<p>In a quiet river, the water gurgles, and the ducks quietly stop by the moist mud. Those preening their feathers are preening, and those brushing their feathers are brushing. Their mood is very comfortable and relaxed. At a set time, the duck herder is awakened from a sleepy state, takes a handful of grains, scatters them on the water, and whistles. The ducks swarm up to grab the grains. At this time, it is like a battle for soldiers, and water splashes onto the riverbank.</p>
<p>The duck herder drives the ducks from before the morning star sets until the sun sets in the mountains, and only after driving the ducks into the fence can they rest. They endure hardship in order to have a considerable income from duck eggs, but since the rural economy collapsed and the market price of chicken and duck eggs has plummeted, the rural sideline industry has declined sharply. Although they are still driving the ducks and struggling in the atmosphere of sun and rain, the harshness of the environment is far less comfortable than before.</p>
<h3>You Snatch, I Plunder</h3>
<p>— By Shiying</p>
<h3>Fragrant Shadow, Misty Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, although the Empress Dowager did not receive them, or perhaps they themselves knew that the Empress Dowager would never let them be seen, they would not dare to be lazy this time, no matter how bold they were; everyone rushed to the station before the train driver arrived. Their only goal was that the Empress Dowager would express satisfaction with the arrangements at the station, and that there would not be a single idler around, so that they could rest assured. However, they were still very timid, and were busy messing around at a place far away from the train, and no one dared to approach it without permission. I looked out the car window from afar and saw many people wearing brightly colored official uniforms lined up in a row about half a kilometer long, wriggling; everyone exuded a kind of sincere fear and was trying their best to arrange things. But in fact, what they were busy with were all trivial things that would never be of any benefit to the Empress Dowager or this train, truly so-called (not one thing to be commended): only this carp was barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Speaking of carp, probably no one can avoid wanting to eat it? Carp is originally a delicious fish, especially when it is cooked right after it is caught, the taste is particularly delicious. We can often see this delicacy at the banquets of ordinary wealthy families. Some people who like to pay attention to food, in order to boast about their wealth and attention to eating, often teach their servants to bring a few lively carp in a large wooden basin to the guests in front of them when there are many guests, and ask them to pick one at will, and immediately take it in to wash, peel, and cook; some people even teach their family's chefs to wash and peel the carp they have chosen in front of the guests, to show that they will never change it again.</p>
<p>The few carp that the Empress Dowager received at Fengtai Station had also been inspected by me one by one, because the Empress Dowager herself was unwilling to meet with those officials, so she sent me to be the representative; the result of my inspection was very satisfactory, and not one of the fish was not swimming around lively. But we didn't teach our chef to kill it on the spot. Probably the Empress Dowager's personality was particularly firm and decisive, but she could not bear to watch a fish die in front of her.

<h3>Wang the Blind</h3>
<p>— Master of the Spring Rain Pavilion</p>
<p>I remember when I was working in Suzhou, after finishing my official duties, I had nothing to do, so I would go to a general store to sit for a while and chat about the Classic of Mountains and Seas. Across the street from the general store was a copper and tin shop. The owner of the copper and tin shop was very stingy and often skimped on the meals of his employees, while he himself liked to put on a show.</p>
<p>The owner's surname was Wang, and he was blind in one eye. Everyone called him Wang the Blind, and he didn't mind. His copper and tin shop, which he had opened for less than ten years, had already made him a small fortune. He supervised his employees at work and was very frugal, so it was easy for him to get rich. Every day after dinner, he would take a dry tobacco pipe and lean against the shop door, slowly smoking. The employees in the general store often made fun of him.</p>
<p>(Hey, Wang the Blind boss! What are you eating with your rice today?)</p>
<p>(Nothing much, just fried lard residue.)</p>
<p>In fact, the employees had eaten vegetarian food all day, but his whiskers were wiped with lard skin, so they were very greasy. Every night he bragged about eating meat, which the young employees in the shop hated. One afternoon, a mischievous young clerk secretly wiped some feces on the lard skin that was hanging next to his washbasin. After dinner, he followed his usual routine of wiping some oil from the lard skin hanging next to the washbasin onto his mouth. He walked to the door with his dry tobacco pipe in his mouth.</p>
<p>(Wang the Blind boss! What are you eating with your rice today?)</p>
<p>(Nothing much, dried vegetables with braised pork.)</p>
<p>(That's not right, what else are you eating? What's that yellow stuff on your whiskers?)</p>
<p>He stroked his whiskers and saw that there was indeed a yellow, smelly substance. He quickly replied: (Dried shrimp fried with eggs.) He ran inside and saw the feces on the lard skin, and he was furious, but a young clerk was chuckling to himself.</p>
<p>World Bizarre News</p>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<h3>The Age of the Earth</h3>
<p>How old is the Earth exactly? Scientists all over the world have been researching hard, but they can’t make a judgment. Recently, at the International Geological Congress held in Washington, D.C., Professor Rein of Tufts University in Boston, synthesizing the opinions of scholars in geology, astronomy, physics, mechanical science, mathematics, and all other fields around the world, published a surprising opinion. He said: We used forty unique machines of various kinds to investigate the age of the Earth (such as the cosometer invented in the twentieth century). The results of the measurements show that the Earth will be destroyed after 1.852 billion years have passed since the gas solidified. This calculation was made using a watch with the action of lanthanum and thirty-nine other special machines, through the precise estimation of hundreds of people's brains.</p>
<h3>The Breadth of the Universe</h3>
<p>How vast is the space in which we live? Mathematicians, philosophers, thinkers, and textual researchers from ancient times to the present still do not understand, so this mysterious riddle remains difficult to solve. Recently, Dr. William Shett, a scholar at the Wilson Observatory in California, North America, observed celestial bodies in the 100-inch telescope installed at the observatory over the past few years, coupled with detailed mathematical calculations, and estimated that the breadth of the universe is between 200 million and 2 billion light-years in diameter (one light-year is the distance that light travels in one year). The speed of light can travel ten trillion kilometers in two seconds, so it is determined that the diameter of the universe is ten trillion kilometers multiplied by one billion.</p>
<h3>People Two Hundred Years From Now</h3>
<p>Dr. David Shipley, a psychologist in New York, USA, recently published a strange theory in Chicago. He said that after investigating the condition of human beings over the past ten years, the rate of increase in insane people has reached 30%, because the onset of neurasthenia and mental illness in humans has increased year by year. It is predicted that by 2139 AD, all human beings in the world will suffer from mental illness, and they will all be crazy. The reason for the madness is probably from (worry). For example, rich people have to worry about kidnapping and the use of money, poor people have to worry about food, clothing, housing and transportation, and the middle class have to worry about maintaining the status quo. Thus, people of the upper, middle and lower classes all suffer from mental illness. The doctor said this based on the detailed experimental results of the good characteristics of critics, enthusiasts, stubborn people, and intelligent people.</p>
<h3>Bread Ten Thousand Years Ago</h3>
<p>Bread dating back 7,000 years was discovered on the shores of a lake in Switzerland. The bread has been carbonized, the large ones weigh 40 pounds and the small ones about 8 pounds. According to archaeological research, the items are from 10,000 years ago, when a couple lived in a stone cave on the Great Ling Peak of the Himalayas, and made bread using the light and heat of the sun. According to this legend, the history of bread is indeed 10,000 years old.</p>
<h3>An Egg Worth Four Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>Hamilton University in the United States has an egg worth $3,700, which was laid by a prehistoric monster (dinosaur). It was bought from an antique dealer in China. Last month, a thief broke into the university, wanting to steal the egg, but fortunately it was hidden in an automatic alarm box and was not stolen. It is said that the egg has turned into jade, can emit light at night, and is warm in winter and cool in summer, and is a rare treasure.</p>
<h3>World's Tallest Tower</h3>
<p>The United States is recently building the world's tallest tower on the shore of Lake Michigan in Chicago, reaching a height of 2,063 feet. It was designed by technician Frank Ellert and will cost $3 million. The column of the surrounding pillars has a 100-foot square observation deck at the 1,933-foot point, and a 180-foot square observation deck at the 1,000-foot point. This tower is 1,079 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, so it is the tallest tower in the world.</p>

<p>Loose Foreign Exchange</p>
<h3>The Gold Market Initially Stable, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Hedging Sales, U.S. Continues to Purchase Silver. The Result is a Fall of Three Dollars and Forty Cents. Yesterday, the gold market was initially stable, then weak. The looseness of the foreign exchange market caused this. However, there were many ups and downs in one day. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw London shrinking and the U.S. remaining flat. The price of raw gold in London and foreign exchange rates also fell. U.S. cotton rose 19 pounds, U.S. wheat rose half a point, and stock prices rose and fell slightly. People's hearts were in good spirits. The opening price of goods rose to 60 yuan, but the opening price was too high. Sellers were brave and gradually lowered prices. The opening of gold industry preparatory transactions was fairly stable. After the opening, banks' appetite tightened, and the internal market hardened. Hedgers took the opportunity to hedge, so there were many sellers in the market, and the entire market became weak. However, people's hearts were still calm. Buyers were active when they saw low prices, and Chinese merchants were still buying. It was predicted that the exchange rate of HSBC Bank would not move. Gradually, it rebounded. Later, the Central Bank suddenly opened for cash, and people's hearts were shaken. The internal market once tightened. Under the vigorous purchase of large households, the gold market revealed its sharpness. However, the rise was temporary. Banks took the opportunity to sell high, and sellers were still eager, so it still fell. At this time, the overall trend fluctuated, and the market was stable. It hovered around 6 yuan for a long time. Finally, due to the looseness of the foreign exchange market, hedgers jointly sold off. News from foreign firms was unfavorable, and the selling wind was fierce. However, it still rose after falling, because the phenomenon in the market was relatively dry. The market was stable at noon. The afternoon market opened flat. Fellow merchants were keen to cover their short positions. It gradually improved. However, because of the news that the price in Mumbai had risen by 4.4.4 annas, it turned back again. However, people's hearts were not shaken. After the foreign exchange market tightened, the market price was still pulled up. However, after the high price, the supply surged again, and it still fell back. Finally, Mumbai fell by 2.2.2 annas, and the final situation was balanced. There was a lack of special news throughout the day. Only Reuters' U.S. Bank report stated that the total amount of silver purchased after the U.S. Treasury Secretary announced that the silver would be taken back to the country was 33,465.091 ounces, which was a small amount. The news that the purchase of newly produced mine silver will continue under the silver purchase regulations failed to make the opening firm. The Associated Press also had similar news in the morning, which slightly affected the gold market and caused the price to rise and fall. Now, the market situation of the day will be recorded as follows. The morning opening was 956 yuan and 70 cents, which was the same price as the previous close. The opening price of goods was 6 yuan and 50 cents.

Later, the bank came out with November U.S. dollars at 375, and it gradually fell from 6 yuan and 70 cents. Although Qingfa and Yong and others bought in, the struggle was weak. Hengtai, Zhaofengchang, Yuanyi, Shunmao, Yiyu, Zhentai, Da Decheng, and Da Lianbang sold off together. November U.S. dollars at half a yuan already had sellers, and it fell to 1 yuan and 10 cents.

Yuanyi, Qianchangxiang, and Fu'an sold off and retreated. Mumbai rose 4 annas, and it fell to 2 yuan and 50 cents. However, people's hearts were obedient, and the internal market was tight. Dafa, Yongfu, Xingyong, Bingxing, Yongli, Yuyu, Qingyong, and Da Decheng and others purchased together, and it rose to 4 yuan and 70 cents. Yuanyi and Dingkang sold goods, and it stepped downstream. The bank filled October U.S. dollars at 3.125 and November at 4.375, and it fell to 3 yuan and 10 cents. Mumbai returned a small 2 annas, and the situation was very stable.

It was found that the highest price of the day was 957 yuan and 50 cents, and the lowest price was 951 yuan and 10 cents, a difference of 6 yuan and 40 cents. As a result, it fell 3 yuan and 40 cents compared to the previous close. The settlement price was still calculated at 34 yuan and 75 cents because HSBC Bank's U.S. dollar listing did not move. The standard gold price was 995 yuan and zero. According to the closing price, it was about 42 yuan. It was 3 yuan more than the previous close.

The acceptance of spot dealers was not good. Therefore, the Tianjin gang sold 700 taels to Da Decheng and 350 taels to Taikangrun. The price was only 13 yuan and 50 cents, which was still a rolling account transaction. In addition, the market was calm. It was heard that the Central Bank opened 700 taels of spot to a bull company at a price of 956 yuan. In addition, it was also heard that there were scattered transactions among spot dealers. Because the Central Bank opened spot for the swap, the price was more than 1 yuan higher than the standard price for the period. Therefore, Da Lianbang, Shunli, Wanxing, and Tongtaichang Fuchang pasted Yingfeng, Hengdingtai, Yingxiang, Yuanmao, Yongda Decheng, and Dafa Yong, etc., and the price ranged from 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 40 cents.

After the closure of Five-Hua Bank</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Market Price Slightly Affected</h3>
<p>▲Call Rate Opens to 1 Cent and 1 Point. The silver dollar market price has never exceeded 1 cent above in recent years. The highest peak of the commission and handling fee has only been 7 cents. However, yesterday's market situation, due to the confirmed news of the closure of Five-Hua Bank, although it had no major impact on the market, people were inevitably panicked, causing the sudden tightening of silver dollar demand at one time. In the morning and afternoon markets, the silver dollar call rate broke the old range and opened at 1 cent and 1 point, an increase of 1 point compared to the previous day. The commission and handling fee was initially 6 cents, but later, because small banks were inevitably tightening, the market price suddenly doubled, calculated as 1 cent and 2 points. This was a special situation in yesterday's market. It is expected that it will still fall back today and tomorrow. In the bill exchange transaction, more than 3.6 million was transferred and newly transacted in the morning market, more than 400,000 in the afternoon market, more than 200,000 in the Small General Assembly, more than 400,000 were redeemed in the silver dollar mortgage transaction, and more than 800,000 were newly made.

<h3>Small Coins are Scarce and Copper Coins are Shortened</h3>
<p>Yesterday's small coin market situation has slightly become scarce. The Jiangnan small silver dollar was 834.5 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was slightly better by 5 cents compared to the previous day. Transactions were made. 3,000 small coins were made in the morning market and 4,000 small coins were made in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was more than 1 yuan better in the morning market, at 739.5 yuan. It increased by another 2 cents in the afternoon market, at 739.7 yuan.

<h3>Securities Public Bonds Rebound and Rise</h3>
<p>The Second Session Rose by 45 Cents to 1.9 Yuan. Trading Was Booming and Still Around 40 Million. Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a sudden and drastic rebound in the market. It went back and forth, and speculators were exhausted. The trading was booming, which had never been seen before. The actual number of transactions on the previous day was more than 42.3 million. It was completed at midnight, which was a new record in recent years. Yesterday's trading was also very smooth and still around 40 million. The details could not be sorted out and could only be omitted. The reason for the market price to rebound so quickly was not without reason, nor was it a large drop and a small rebound. It was because large bull households had no way out. The financial sector organized a large-scale hedging. With strong strength and strong appetite, the shorts suddenly felt that they had lost their basis. Rumors stopped, and the outflow of cash had been effectively curbed. Therefore, the silver call rate was only 1 point higher than the previous day. There were signs of panic among the shorts on the market. In the blink of an eye, the settlement was due. If a short squeeze was triggered, then the rise would be even more intense. The initial opening yesterday, the retrenchment and demobilization still showed a downward trend, ranging from 3 cents to 8 cents. Since the 19th pass, the platform had felt that demand exceeded supply and gradually trended upward. The later it got, the stronger it got. The 20th pass rebounded by 1.6 yuan. No. 4 and No. 41 had the most appetite. In the second session, some people still suspected that it would return, but unexpectedly, the rise was in full swing. It continued to rise by several cents to 1.23 yuan. The trend had the possibility of rising again. As a result, except for the retrenchment which was still a small 12 cents, the rest all rose by 45 cents to 1.9 yuan. Among them, the demobilization rebounded by 4 cents at least, and its previous drop of 2.85 yuan was the largest, which was also uneven. The comparison table of its rebound results is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

<h3>Yarn Flower Standard Yarn Market State Lonely and Spiritless</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and tired, and the situation is particularly bleak. The trading in the market is quite light. Both the long and short sides are restricting the scope of their operations. However, the bulls in the financial sector have not completely sold out. Therefore, although the market is soft, new sellers are not very active. As for the yarn inventory of the factory side, it has been emptied a lot compared to before. Therefore, the spot yarn market is still firm.</p>
<h3>The Golden Rooster Again Reveals Weakness</h3>
<p>Before the yarn market opened, although American cotton rose, the market situation was still weak. Because there were not many sellers, and the money shops (錢莊) were bullish and remained unmoved, without adding to their positions, the bearish sentiment grew stronger day by day. Prices for each month fell by 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that sales of spot yarn were relatively low, and the market remained sluggish. Moreover, some long positions were closed out, causing prices for each month to fall by another 0.2 or 0.4 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,700 bales. Sales included Dafeng (大豐) 5 bales, Yuda (裕大) 350 bales, Huikang (惠康) 1,200 bales, Taichang (泰昌) 500 bales, Xiesheng (恊生) 800 bales, and Yicheng (義成) 350 bales. Purchases included Yuanda (源大) 300 bales, Xinchang (新昌) 500 bales, Yikang (義康) 900 bales, Renfeng (仁豐) 750 bales, Yida (頥大) 600 bales, Changfeng (長豐) 850 bales, Runkang (潤康) 500 bales, Shenji (愼記) 550 bales, and Dachang (大昶) 550 bales.

<h3>The First Batch of New Yao Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then stabilized, but American cotton rebounded, failing to excite the market. As new domestic cotton gradually entered the market, holders were inclined to sell, further strengthening the bearish sentiment. The first batch of new Yao cotton from Ningbo arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling over 530 bales. The asking price ranged from 33.4 yuan to 32.5 yuan. However, Japanese firms found it too soft and unsuitable and did not make any purchases.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Averages Out</h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton market was fairly average, but American cotton rose again by 25 points. Market sentiment was not particularly strong because the arrival of new cotton made it difficult to stimulate bullish interest. Near months were average, while far months fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the market suddenly perked up as profitable long positions were closed out. Additionally, the opening price for new common cotton fell by another 0.5 yuan. As a result, the current month fell by 0.1 yuan, and middle months rose by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 52,300 dan. Sales included Hengyi (恒益) 1,600 dan, Shenji (愼記) 2,500 dan, Yuanyi (元一) 1,000 dan, Runkang (潤康) 2,700 dan, Minghua (明華) 2,200 dan, Shenchang (愼昌) 1,100 dan, Yichang (益昶) 2,000 dan, and Dachang (大昶) 1,000 dan.

<p>Year 23</p>
<h3>First Estimate Report on National Cotton Production (Continued)</h3>
<p>This year's national cotton production is higher than last year's due to an increase in cotton fields. The situation varies by province, with some advancing and others receding. In the Yellow River basin, cotton production, except for Henan, has increased compared to last year. In the Yangtze River basin, the cotton fields in Hunan and Jiangsu, and the cotton production in Zhejiang and Anhui, have slightly increased, while the rest have decreased. The north and south are almost the opposite. The reason for this is that domestic improvements in cotton cultivation have become increasingly popular in recent years, primarily in the Yellow River basin. These improvements often involve promoting American cotton, which is particularly suitable for the Yellow River region. Therefore, the trend of increasing cotton fields in the north continues each year. The weather was also better in the north this year. Jiangsu in the Yangtze River basin suffered from drought, and Hubei suffered from drought in the east and floods in the northwest, both leading to reduced production. Although the north also experienced droughts in many areas, most areas received rain, resulting in satisfactory growth. Therefore, both the cotton field area and production in the Yellow River basin have increased significantly, while the south has experienced a slight decline. According to this estimate, the total cotton field area is 44,441,047 mu, an increase of 5,283,599 mu compared to the first estimate of last year, and an increase of 3,987,024 mu compared to the revised estimate of last year, representing an increase of approximately 9.85%. Total cotton production is 10,497,924 dan, a decrease of 236,527 dan compared to the first estimate of last year, but an increase of 723,717 dan compared to the revised estimate of last year, representing an increase of approximately 7.4%. The average yield per mu is 23.5 catties, a decrease of 3.7 catties compared to the first estimate of last year's 27.2 catties, and a decrease of 0.7 catties compared to the revised estimate of last year's 24.2 catties. It is close to the average of 23.8 catties for the past 15 years. Therefore, this year's cotton crop can be considered normal.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Rises Due to Lack of Sellers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose because of a lack of sellers, positive news from Liverpool, and unfavorable weather conditions. The market was quiet but firm, resulting in a 25-point increase in spot prices and a 19- to 26-point increase in futures prices. British cotton futures fell by one point. Indian cotton was firm due to favorable cotton harvest estimates and positive news from Liverpool. As a result, Pingguoer (平果爾), Aomula (奥姆辣), Bairuoxi (白羅溪) all rose by 0.25 yuan.

<h3>The Greatest Decline in Flour Prices This Month</h3>
<p>-Wheat Futures Also Fall-</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, prices for each month initially stabilized before weakening. The price of foreign wheat from Chicago was up 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and Canadian wheat was up 0.08 to 0.1 yuan. At the opening, near and far months were approximately 0.01 yuan higher than the previous day. However, after the second session, the actual sales from the northern firms were inactive, and the inventory of spot flour in each factory was reported to have increased. This weakened the bullish sentiment, leading to selling. This month, due to the proximity of delivery, many weak longs closed out positions, resulting in a loose market, especially for this month. After the market opened in the afternoon, prices for each month continued to decline. The opening price for this month fell to 5.03 yuan. Far months also weakened simultaneously. However, after repeated declines, trading volume decreased significantly as external longs became cautious, and those considering closing out positions found it difficult to advance or retreat. The sharp rise and fall in the market can be attributed to two main reasons: the inappropriate price increases and the sudden halt in actual sales, leading to an accumulation of factory flour. As a result, market sentiment loosened, speculation disappeared, and the market had to fall. Consequently, this month fell by another 0.0425 yuan compared to the previous day, September fell by 0.0325 yuan, October fell by 0.02 yuan, November fell by 0.0225 yuan, December fell by 0.03 yuan, and January fell by 0.03 yuan.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened this morning, prices for each month initially stabilized before falling. The price of foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada was up 0.08 to 0.12 yuan. Therefore, the market was relatively stable at the opening for each month. However, buying interest stopped, and the flour market weakened step by step. Although trading was not active, prices continued to decline. By the afternoon session, August and September futures had fallen, while far months remained relatively stable. This month's lowest price reached 3.87 yuan, a significant drop of 0.6 yuan from the high price on the 8th of this month. The rapid rise and fall were entirely due to market sentiment. The loosening of the market was mainly driven by the flour market because the price of domestic wheat is currently unable to fall to this level. Consequently, this month fell by 0.08 yuan, September fell by 0.04 yuan, October and November were unchanged, December fell by 0.02 yuan, and January fell by 0.07 yuan. It is reported that the Grain Merchant Association did not engage in trading of spot wheat. Direct allocations from merchants to factories amounted to over 10,000 bags. High-quality wheat was offered at 0.95 to 0.97 yuan, which was purchased by Fuxin (福新).</p>
<h3>Tinplate Prices Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Recently, the tinplate market has seen a sharp increase in demand and a surge in prices due to telegrams from factories. This has driven up prices in Shanghai significantly. Current market estimates are as follows: 90-pound American goods are offered at 16.5 yuan (with iron shell) and 16 yuan (without iron shell). Shuangyun (雙運) is offered at 30 yuan (90 pounds) and 31.5 yuan (80 pounds). 100-pound American goods with iron shell are offered at 17.5 yuan, and without iron shell at 17 yuan. Shuanglian (雙連) goods are offered at 36 yuan. German goods are sold at 31 yuan for 90 pounds and 33 yuan for 100 pounds. British goods are out of stock and there is no market. Although Italian and French goods have arrived, the quantities are small, resulting in no significant market to report. 200-pound Huisi (惠司) iron is offered at 29.5 yuan, and lower quality iron is offered at 28.5 yuan. The estimated prices in each market are 0.5 to 2 yuan higher than the previous market.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>An American Professor's Japanese Trick</h3>
<p>—Yong</p>
<p>It was a matter of easy resolution: simply find a familiar American professor, provide him with adequate materials, everything needed for publishing books, and, most importantly, present him with a sizable check. Recently, a book titled "A Bird's-Eye View of Manchukuo" appeared in the Japanese publishing world, an English book bound in the American style.</p>
<p>The author of the book is Dr. James Scherer, former president of the California Institute of Technology. To make the book interesting and full of content, he put on Japanese clothing and began what he called scientific exploration from the historical depths of centuries ago.</p>
<p>In the entire first chapter, he explained that the reason why the Chinese built the Great Wall was to isolate the Manchus. This historical basis found by the American professor proves that the Japanese imperialists who seized the three northeastern provinces did not violate any Chinese rights, but only Japan continued the historical mission of the Chinese building the Great Wall, a historical mission that the Chinese people failed to complete. In this sense, Japan is not China's enemy, but China's good friend.</p>
<p>If the Chinese do not understand this truth, then China will be in even worse shape. The reasons why the Chinese do not understand are: first, they are purely individualistic; second, they are cunning at heart. In fact, look at what a dangerous situation the Chinese have put the great powers in!</p>
<p>The Chinese are the most excitable diplomats in the world, the doctor stated with certainty. Their diplomatic principle is "using violence against violence," playing the great powers off against each other, making them kill each other.</p>
<p>Now we can understand where the struggle of the imperialists in China comes from? It is entirely the result of the Chinese diplomats running around and stirring things up. Where is the evidence? There is, everything is in the travel bags of these agitators. The Russo-Japanese War was organized by the Chinese. Do others not know this? But this Dr. Scherer knows it.</p>
<p>The doctor has more evidence, listen to him, he said that China's victory in the League of Nations, with the help of Dr. Rajchman, is the second piece of evidence. If you want to ask, what victory did China gain? Japan has not only not returned Manchuria, but also occupied Rehe, and is invading North China and Mongolia to realize its dream of dominating the entire China and becoming a great empire in East Asia. Where is China's victory? The doctor slowly replied: this is not important, China's victory is huge, do not forget: poor Japan came into direct conflict with the Lytton Commission after seizing Manchuria!</p>
<p>The doctor eloquently narrated his evidence: everyone knows that the result of the battle in Geneva was that China won, which put Japan at a disadvantage and isolated it. Not only that, this influence made Tokyo and Washington face each other across the Pacific Ocean. Now everyone should understand where the opposition between Japan and the United States comes from? This opposition was provoked by Chinese diplomats.</p>
<p>In short: the root of all evil in the Far East is China. The fundamental problem in the Far East is not Japan but China. Today's China has not only become a danger to China itself, but also a poison to the whole world, a serious wound to Japan's life. In East Asia, only Japan upholds the idea of management based on order, which Western Europeans also believe in. Has Japan made mistakes? Then the whole world has made mistakes! Japan wants to build a model country as a buffer between China's anarchy and Soviet red terror, which is a good lesson for China; moreover, Japan's approach is not only for its own safety, but also to serve the world!</p>
<p>This American professor wearing Japanese clothes blatantly shows his true face. In order to thoroughly implement the formula in the Lytton Commission's report as a way to solve the China problem, he said frankly: (The satisfactory solution to the China problem lies in international cooperation to provide China's internal policies.)</p>
<p>This American professor's trick is even more clever. He suggests partitioning China while wearing Eastern clothes, which is naturally more colorful and pleasant to hear.</p>
<p>The above words are only about solving the entire China problem, how does this doctor "bird's-eye view" Manchukuo? He said that everything there is solved, everything is so good. Manchuria is already heaven, although the living standards of the Japanese are twice as high as those of the Chinese farmers, but it does not matter, Manchukuo is heaven on earth, and the farmers of Manchuria are the happiest people in the world. He inserted many pictures praising and extolling them, including one of two smiling young people holding hoes, which is a symbol of the life of the farmers in that paradise.</p>
<p>Where did these photos come from? The author of the book makes it clear in the preface: (I am very grateful for the courtesy of the (Manchukuo)) and the Japanese government, they provided me with an airplane to widely capture films.)</p>
<p>This American professor's Japanese trick is unique, his (A Bird's-Eye View of Manchukuo,) is truly bird's-eye viewed from paradise sitting on a Japanese airplane.</p>
<p>Now it should be understood that in the capitalist ocean, no drop of water carries the color of justice and humanity, but the Chinese, especially those who want to befriend the United States, are still in a deep dream!</p>
<h3>The Maple Leaves Have Turned Red!</h3>
<p>—Ye Fei</p>
<p>The maple leaves have turned red</p>
<p>The crimson maple leaves floated in one by one from the window, floating, floating, landing right on my desk.</p>
<p>(Ah! The maple leaves have turned red, it's autumn; time flies so quickly!) I couldn't help but sigh, and cleared the maple leaves from the desk. I fear autumn; because the flowers, trees, scenes and objects in autumn all contain infinite sadness; it is really too easy to touch people's sorrows! (Writing about autumn heart is to write about sorrow!) Indeed, autumn is a touching season!</p>
<p>Autumn's fate is just like that of the elderly; life loses its vitality, and everything that was lively and lovely in spring now seems to be covered with a layer of gray, dim clothing, revealing a withering, desolate scene.</p>
<p>I remember ten years ago, in an autumn season, after being pulled to the city by the leash of life, it has been ten years now. Although I have (returned to my hometown) countless times during these ten years, the center of my life has always been tied to the city. Life in the city cannot escape selling sweat, blood and labor; sometimes, even the soul has to be sold. Under the constant toil and travel, the situation is truly sad; so I have no leisure to experience the true meaning of life, I only know, like others, that a person is nothing more than a machine for eating and working; even if there are other responsibilities, I have not tasted them.</p>
<p>People are all characters on the world stage; of course, the characters are also different, with distinctions of sheng, dan, jing, and chou. When a person first cries out from his mother's embrace, they are all the same, but later, because each person plays a different role, some are smeared with white powder, red oil, black ink, and some are fitted with a fake beard, so what appears on this world stage are all ugly, grotesque appearances wearing masks. Moreover, in order to make this world stage even more lively, they constantly kill and devour each other! Unfortunately, I have also entered this vortex, becoming a character on the world stage, but I don't know if it's jing or chou? Or sheng or dan? I really don't know, maybe others can see what I am; no, they themselves don't even know what role they are playing! I follow others, getting up at dawn to eat and work, going to sleep when it gets dark; passing the time day after day. I have never bothered to count what day it is today? Seeing people shirtless, I know it is summer, and I take off my shirt in the same way, indicating that I also know it is hot. Seeing people wearing cotton clothes, I know it is winter, and I put on cotton clothes in the same way; when the green grass sprouts and the flowers bloom, I understand that spring has arrived; the maple leaves turn red, the grass stems wither, and I unhesitatingly realize that autumn has come. I am truly a wandering soul with (a face full of frost and snow, not knowing the year)! Ten years away from home, ten years away from my old home, ten years, these ten years of wandering life have destroyed my soul! Grief has numbed my nerves! Hardship has poisoned my limbs! My former beautiful dreams have finally been shattered by the ugly reality! The bright future has been blocked by a barrier of fate! My heart now feels as empty as a desert wasteland, and I am like a lone boat sailing in a vast ocean, letting it drift, letting it float, but both concerned about being swallowed by giant whales and fearing the collapse of icebergs, the future is vast, and I don't know where the other shore is?</p>
<p>My past life was just an ugly nightmare; my current life has fallen into the abyss of sorrow; and the future is so dark and terrifying that I don't have the courage to look ahead. I have been struggling on the road of human life for more than ten years, and more than ten years of experience tell me that life is originally a child's play. Years pass by, acts are played out, all of which are nothing but ugly dramas. Anyway, being a person is just floating in the world and playing a game, why must you get to the bottom of it; when the drama ends, everything is over, over! I think:</p>
<p>Now that the maple leaves have turned red, I only know that autumn has come again! (The past is like a dream, the shadows are like a tide) which makes me think of old things and I can't help but feel sad!</p>
<p>(Oh! The maple leaves have turned red, it's autumn; time flies so quickly.)</p>
<h3>Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Wei Nan</p>
<p>As far as the eye can see, it's so vast and hazy. Although there are streetlights, this effort of (light) struggles to break through the desolate silence of the darkness. Here, it symbolizes everything in life, the deformed state of society. Amidst the twinkling of stars, in the feeble glow of streetlights, this vague wilderness in the city needs endless groping; alas, the blind with eyes are bound to stumble again and again. Here, there is the same ruggedness as the path of life, the same steepness, with people crawling along!</p>
<p>Although summer is retreating in the pursuit of autumn, concealing its ferocious appearance, the lingering autumn atmosphere still fondly clings to this vexing shrew. As I lean by the window, I cannot help but recall the autumn nights of my rural village:</p>
<p>Was it an early autumn evening? It was the same as the autumn night now, with stars, drifting clouds, and a crescent moon, with the same desolate darkness, but with more mosquitoes than here, more and denser autumn insects, crying out: In the fields, in the wilderness, on the dikes, in the treetops, beneath the steps, in the entirety of nature. Yet, the crickets urged on the diligent farm women, but not to weave clothes or thread needles, nor at home, but helping their husbands with farm work – desperately treading water along the dike. The "gulugulu" sound stirs the water in the small river, shattering the entire sky, shaking the tall trees standing on the dike. (Fatigue) seems to have lost its form here, lost its dependence; it seems as if such a thing does not exist in their hearts. Murmuring whispers, although the ripples of water do not disturb the flow of nature, the sweet and vibrant atmosphere envelops the entire rural surroundings.</p>
<p>The demon of famine has been defeated by them, though they themselves are so diligent, but they do not feel it. Oh, a sweet and vibrant autumn night in the countryside! But what about the countryside now? Famine, disasters, natural and man-made calamities plague its entire body: it is a morbid, sorrowful deformity!</p>
<p>Yet here – the unique and original desolation of the wilderness in the city – in such an autumn night, one can only be reminded of the past prosperity, lamenting the present desolation. The tear-like stars twinkling in the sky, obscured by the clouds, and the mournfully chirping crickets are all mourning the misery here!</p>
<p>Isn't there a dazzling electric torch over there? Is it London, Paris, or Jerusalem? There are wealthy people riding in cars, poor children with no clothes to wear; there are bums and tycoons; there is heaven and hell, peace and sorrow, in this boundless atmosphere of demons. Here, there is only a vast autumn night, covered by vast darkness, vastness engulfing this sinful land!</p>
<h3>Return</h3>
<p>— Xin Qin</p>
<p>The boat is constantly rocking, and my heart is trembling even more! The closer the boat gets to Shantou Island, the more flustered my heart becomes, not knowing what to do! As the boat enters the harbor, my whole body seems to leap up. Long-separated hometown, suddenly meeting again, no matter how stubborn I am; the Lingnan flavor has already drifted into my heart with the southern wind, and I cannot help but be swept up by boundless nostalgia! As the boat enters the port of Mayu, a wave of gentle, poignant tears wells up in my chilled heart! My mind and eyes seem to overflow with waves.</p>
<p>The hometown is still the hometown after all, a hometown that cannot allow me, a wanderer, to settle down. At this moment, I find it lovely and hateful at the same time. Elegant mountain peaks, large and small, are arrayed along the seaside; that is the homeland! Gradually, the fishing boats become more numerous. Far away on the water, a small boat drifts along. I cannot see clearly what it is; it is a fishing boat rolling in the white waves! I stand on the deck, staring with apprehension. The black dot on the water gradually appears, and the fisherman standing on the small boat is like a blade of grass. As the waves rise high, the boat floats; as the waves recede, the boat seems to be submerged. I feel anxious for them, but in an instant, it floats up again, and no water rushes into the boat.</p>
<p>Jue Shi Mountain is right next to the boat now. The clear and elegant mountain, all the scenery, wounds my heart and captivates my soul! What a beautiful place! However, how can I, a wanderer, have the chance to be with it! A wanderer is only fit to drift east and west, ending up in a place like a garbage dump. I think of the small pavilion room life in the city, truly envying the house and buildings on the secluded Jue Shi Mountain. But this only adds another layer of aversion! I do not have this kind of leisure!</p>
<p>As the boat reaches the customs, the sounds of my hometown seem to be faintly heard. My listless gaze keeps nodding towards the scenery ahead. However, I, a person full of injuries, finally just walks ashore without any taste.</p>
<p>Amidst the clamorous voices of people on the dock, after walking only a few steps, the local customs of Shantou Island streets gently float up to greet me. Especially the various kinds of fruits displayed in the shops along the street seem to make one's mouth water, with bursts of rich fragrance emanating. The bright red lychees lie there charmingly, one by one, plump and round. I, a lonely person, cannot help but smile.</p>
<p>I feel as if I have seen an old friend after a long separation, forgetting the pain in an instant. Ah, stepping onto Shantou Island! My heart is indeed a little lighter for a moment.</p>
<p>However, when I savor everything on Shantou Island, I fall into a daze of gloom again. Meeting the villagers, they tell me their stories, one by one.</p>
<p>The sorrowful state of the ruined hometown, everything has changed so quickly! Half a day after stepping onto Shantou Island, I am gradually suffocating. One corner of the revolutionary source of restoration and bankruptcy – Shantou, I cannot say anything!</p>
<h3>Miss Suzie</h3>
<p>— Miss Jiong</p>
<p>Time passes like flowing water. The innocent, lively Miss Suzie, whom people used to call the goddess of swiftness a few years ago, has already, with the passage of time, no longer as swift and carefree as she used to be – in these years of wandering and struggling life, she has deeply felt that the cruelty and sins of all people in this society are due to the poor organization of this society!</p>
<p>In the morning, the soft morning breeze blows. In the sky, there are only a few white clouds and a round of pale red sun, just rising, reflected on the ground, filtering into her room through the window. At this moment, Miss Suzie cannot help but recall the (real) environment she is in. In this (real) environment, there is no freedom. People are treacherous, cunning, base, and sinful to each other. Because of this, Miss Suzie, who struggles all day under the whip of life, has a very rich soul, attempting to go to another place that is more amiable, beautiful, and kind, where people help and love each other. Whenever the environment in front of her oppresses her more severely, these many ceaseless thoughts seem to burst out of her mind, and her spirit begins to feel infinite comfort.</p>
<p>Dangerous waves have been hitting the path she has had to take for more than twenty years, but she has passed them safely and sailed forward. Now, she has finally won first-class honor in this society, in the women's world, and is a bright star!</p>
<p>Whenever there is a moonlit and breezy night, Miss Suzie always runs alone to a nearby garden to enjoy the cool, take a walk, and wander silently in the garden. The last ray of sunlight is gone, and the whole garden is hazy. The night is crawling out of the trees, expanding outward. A light from the electric lamps shines from the branches of the trees and the edge of the pond, illuminating the entire garden. The cool evening breeze rustles her clothes. She leans by the water, looks up and around, and feels that she should transcend this society and live. Arduous struggle is the true meaning of life! She has been working hard in society for more than twenty years, and now she is still living vigorously, excitedly pulling out the light of her future from the dense thorns. I hope, Miss Suzie, keep up the effort!</p>
<h3>Looking Down on an Era</h3>

<h3>The Mermaid</h3>
<p>— Liu Lang</p>
<p>Miss Yang Xiuqiong, the mermaid known to everyone, has returned in response to an invitation. All parts of Beijing and Shanghai are doing their best to support the event, with great enthusiasm, giving rise to the feeling that one regrets not being born a girl.</p>
<p>Therefore, newspapers are printing articles, praising her to the skies, and even the kite king is pulling the reins for her, parading her through the streets. Not only do the newspapers report the facts, but they also print her photographs. Not only do Chinese newspapers do their best to publicize her, but foreign newspapers also extol her great deeds. This is truly a new and beautiful story since the founding of the Republic of China. Therefore, I am composing two bamboo branch poems to record this event:</p>
<p>Poem 1</p>
<p>Her fame is no mere rumor,</p>
<p>Like Zhang Shun in the waves.</p>
<p>They all say pulling the reins is a wonderful sight,</p>
<p>Everyone envies our beautiful fish.</p>
<p>Poem 2</p>
<p>Scholars refuse to be scholars, becoming servants instead,</p>
<p>Parading through the city is joyful indeed.</p>
<p>How envious are La Kuan and Xiao Sizhi,</p>
<p>As the whip cracks, the beauty arrives.</p>
<h3>Death Ray</h3>
<p>After the European war, the great powers, after much painful thought, greatly admired our spiritual civilization and even concluded many treaties among themselves. However, since the September 18th Incident, many treaties have been torn up by invading countries and have had no effect. Therefore, the great powers are actively preparing for war again. Several scientists have abandoned everything and are specializing in the study of lethal weapons.</p>
<p>For example, one country is expanding its air force plan, and another country is building a warship plan. As for machinery, each has its own inventions. For example, Japan has invented an aircraft capture net, and Germany has invented a certain type of cannon. Even our country, the most backward in science, has invented flying mines and flying arrows, etc. Other countries need not be mentioned.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Second World War may not happen, but if the Second World War were to happen, then the mortality rate of that war would exceed that of the First World War by several times, or even hundreds of times. Among the newly invented lethal weapons, the most dangerous one is the (death ray) invented by American Dr. Tesla. It is said that after this thing is invented, it will make war impossible. In an instant, it can kill millions of lives. This thing is the most dangerous. Even all the human beings on the globe can be killed cleanly in a few moments, wouldn't that be great?</p>
<h3>In the Car</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>After the Beginning of Autumn, I suffered from a minor illness for two days, and the vacation I requested from the company was five days, so I went to the countryside for a trip. On the day of returning to my hometown, I woke up very early and sat in a rickshaw to the station. With my collar open, facing the wind, I thought that these short three days were my happy time.</p>
<p>I arrived at the station early, and there were few passengers. I took a corner of the carriage, reading the day's newspapers and a few novels that I brought; this was my way of passing the time while traveling, as if flipping through books could shorten the journey. Otherwise, I would just madly smoke cigarettes.</p>
<p>When it was time for departure, the car was already crowded with people. Everyone is willing to get up early in the summer, especially those who go out to do business; taking the longest journey into account, they still have most of the time left when they arrive at their destination. If they were going to some place to escape the heat, they would take a night train. Time is so worthless to them. I regretted hurrying to catch the early train, as it would be more comfortable to take a midday train, as everyone would be afraid of the heat and there would be fewer passengers; now the carriage is full of people, some unable to find seats and sitting on their luggage, filling this narrow aisle. There are also car vendors selling snacks coming and going, which is a headache. Those who go out to the early market must have filled their stomachs before coming, although many watermelons were sold, it was even harder to find a place to stand in the carriage.</p>
<p>At this time, I no longer had the courage to flip through books, which is to say I was madly smoking cigarettes. The side facing the sun had already closed the wooden window, and there were many others in the car with the same habit. The smoke had no way out and just hovered over everyone's heads, and I felt like I was about to be sick. I chewed a few Ren Dan pills and turned to look out the window.</p>
<p>People who are cooped up in the city come into contact with the boundless fields: those dilapidated ox-cart sheds, farmers wearing straw hats, and even a mangy dog, also feel different. I leaned against the window, watching the earth pass backwards, but I couldn't evoke any of the past emotions. It seemed as if the scene in front of me was a tragic sight, withered rice seedlings, the bottom of the small river turned over. Looking, looking, this trip back to my hometown is truly troublesome; my hometown must also be in this situation, my old mother has added a few more strands of gray hair, and my younger brother no longer jumps around. If I were immersed in the city, I could perhaps enjoy three days of peace. I thought several times about getting off the train at the nearest station and turning back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, the nearest station was already my hometown. Hearing the village accent of the train conductor (XX off the train), I found the person who was shouting and examined his face, trying to find the reason for my return to my hometown. It was an unfamiliar face! A face like those in the city, carrying the heavy luggage on his back, crossing the railroad tracks, and carrying it into the station (Aiyo! Aiyo!) a weak voice.</p>
<p>I walked towards home on the uneven cobblestone road, the train lengthening its echo, heading towards the hometowns of many people.</p>

<p>Novel</p>
<h3>A Major Event in Wujia Town (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>What is the situation inside the gate? All of Father Fu's close relatives have arrived: the clan elder, Old Master Wu, Fu Sheng's uncle, Zhang Defu, Father Fu's concubine's brother, Zhu Quangui, two aunts and their husbands, and then there are cousins and relatives. It is said that they gathered together like this only once when they were revising the genealogy.</p>
<p>They were divided into many small groups talking about news from neighboring towns, predictions about this year's autumn harvest, or else teasing each other and laughing, their attitudes all so natural and leisurely, not at all like the outsiders' speculations.</p>
<p>Father Fu was of course extraordinarily busy today. He instructed the servants to wring towels and serve tea whenever a relative arrived. He himself was rushing in and out as if chasing something. Even his long-held dry tobacco pouch, which he never left his hand, was put down for the second time, like when his eldest son was getting married. Fu Sheng, politely exchanged a few words with each elder, only his two younger brothers were playing with the crickets they had just caught beside the natural table.</p>
<p>This bustling scene only quieted down when Old Master Wu stepped into the hall. They greeted the old master, and those nearby slowly gathered around, while those further away also moved their seats closer to Old Master Wu. This secret matter seemed to be waiting for Old Master Wu to say a word.</p>
<p>Old Master Wu was not polite and sat down in the central armchair. He took the towel wrung by the servant, carefully lifted his neat beard, wiped his face, and then raised his cup and swept it around, saying plainly:</p>
<p>"It's hot today!"</p>
<p>The people around breathed a sigh of relief, and some repeated the sentence "It's hot today!" Presumably the servants had notified him, Father Fu ran out from inside, and said with his hands folded:</p>
<p>"Uncle, it's so hot today, I'm so sorry to trouble you."</p>
<p>Old Master Wu seemed not to have heard, took the dry tobacco pouch handed up by the servant, and began to smoke. The people around exchanged glances, then shifted their gaze from Father Fu to Old Master Wu's dry tobacco pouch.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of silence like this, the sound of cicadas could be heard from afar.</p>
<p>Old Master Wu finished smoking a pipe, and swept his bright eyes around, seeing Father Fu wringing his hands and staring at him.</p>
<p>"Fu Ming, what do you mean, tell us first." The clan elder began today's main topic.</p>
<p>"Uncle" Father Fu made a turn around the hall "My second brother passed away more than ten years ago, Fu Sheng has been adopted in his name, and now he has married a wife, I can also let go of the rights to this share of the property, so I troubled a few relatives..."</p>
<p>Old Master Wu nodded worldly "Where's your sister-in-law?"</p>
<p>"She refuses to come out, saying that everything is up to you, uncle." Fu Sheng's uncle, Zhang Defu, twitched his lips, wanting to speak but Old Master Wu preempted him.</p>
<p>"First spread out the rent books, we'll compare them and then talk."</p>

<h3>The Significance of the Revival of Martial Arts and Supernatural Films</h3>
<p>— Black Tea</p>
<p>Recently, news about the secret production of martial arts films in the film industry has been rampant. At the same time, there are rumors that the Film Inspection Committee is also opening up some martial arts and supernatural films.</p>
<p>When these rumors arose, there were two views on this in the (public opinion):</p>
<p>The first believes that new films have lost the Southeast Asian market, causing widespread recession in the Chinese film industry. Therefore, producing martial arts and supernatural films is a stimulant for the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>The second is that the Film Inspection Committee has banned many films with progressive content, causing pain to film merchants. Therefore, they want to compensate them by allowing general merchants to show martial arts and supernatural films.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, both of these views are not bad. At the same time, both views tend to oversimplify the problem.</p>
<p>It is true that we also know that audiences in Southeast Asia welcome martial arts and supernatural films. A few years ago, martial arts and supernatural films did make money in Southeast Asia. However, we only need to investigate the decline of martial arts and supernatural films in Southeast Asia in the one or two years before the ban, compared to the previous few years, to see that the profits obtained have already been greatly reduced. This decline only shows that Southeast Asian audiences are not tired enough of supernatural martial arts films. The main thing is that the economic situation in Southeast Asia has declined sharply. The price of rubber has fallen to dozens of times lower than before. This is a well-known fact. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for the martial arts and supernatural film market not to decline. As for recently, the economic situation in Southeast Asia has declined even more because of the global economic crisis. Even large capitalists like Chen Jiageng are not immune to bankruptcy, not to mention others. Therefore, the current Chinese film industry is still pursuing the golden age of martial arts and supernatural films in the beginning, and does not hesitate to secretly produce them, which is at least a risky move. Honestly speaking, the current Southeast Asian market for martial arts and supernatural films is even less like the one or two years before the ban.</p>
<p>As for the so-called compensation for the losses of the film industry, it is also a superficial view. In the current Chinese society, some people consciously want to restore it to the medieval period. Promoting the ringing of bells and chanting of Buddhas, the ghosts and gods, and what old morality is all meant to be this. The clothing regulations in various places and the separation of men and women in the south are especially prominent. At the same time, they know that everything is coordinated and powerful. In literature, they are calling for the revival of classical Chinese. In film, one hand (suppresses) progressive works, and the other hand only puts on martial arts and supernatural films, which is definitely not accidental.</p>
<p>We also know that in this year, many things are very difficult, so the so-called (caring for the merchants' difficulties) is basically caring for one's own difficulties. But even if the plan is good, what can be done if the times do not allow it?</p>
<p>Let everything that deserves to die die, that's what I think.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of (The Bootleg King)</h3>
<p>— Dan Feng</p>
<p>The Mad Game – Great Shanghai</p>
<p>As the main field of the art world, everyone understands that film, like other arts, cannot exist beyond class no matter what. In other words, any artist must carry out the tasks of their own class. While (The Bootleg King) is certainly a very mediocre work, it should not be ignored in that it is beneficial to the American rulers.</p>
<p>We can prove his intention from the author's selection of material from the group of rogues and thieves.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if the same subject matter of bandits is observed from the standpoint of realism, then it will inevitably seek the social basis of the bandits and scientifically explain the generation and elimination of bandits. As a result, truly realistic works must not be beneficial to the upper class. Because of this reason, the author of (The Bootleg King) tightly grasped the backward concepts of the rogues. Their criminal behavior, such as bootlegging, kidnapping, and murder, can be immediately used by the rulers and become loyal to the government when they have a slight chance. Therefore, Carson was praised as a hero after he rescued the judge's daughter-in-law from the kidnappers.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this is beneficial to the current political system. He writes about the infighting among bandits, he writes about the utter lack of benevolence and righteousness among bandits, resulting in the eradication of bandits and the peace of the world. This daydreaming with eyes open is considered childish, clumsy, and laughable to us.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the author, from the standpoint of (business acumen), thought that this kind of subject matter could make money. However, because the subject matter of bandits is commonplace and vulgarized, it is not as perfect as he imagined. Although we say that the director's methods are indeed clever and concise in some places, he cannot transcend the scope of the script due to the decision of the story. The script harmed the director, which can be fully exemplified here.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Women's Living Expenses</h3>

<p>Car, telephone, small bills, etc.: 10 yuan</p>
<p>Miscellaneous expenses: 10 yuan</p>
<p>Total per month: US$128</p>
<h3>The Rampant Banditry of Hollywood</h3>
<p>— West Fu</p>
<p>Because Hollywood is the wealthiest area among cities of equal size in the world, the trend of kidnapping is also very rampant, perhaps no less than in Shanghai. However, the security measures are said to be much better than in Shanghai. Nevertheless, many big stars are still uneasy. Therefore, a new industry in Hollywood is kidnapping insurance. A Lloyd's insurance company there accepted a total of three million US dollars in kidnapping insurance from various stars last year. If you add up the money jointly spent by local authorities, various companies, and the movie stars themselves on preventing kidnappers, the amount is indeed considerable.</p>
<p>The stars' unease is perhaps not without reason. Not long ago, Maureen O'Sullivan's car was returning from outside at night. Halfway there, a car suddenly jumped out and blocked her way. Several armed men jumped out of the car. Fortunately, Maureen was not in the car, and those people missed their target and left in a hurry, cursing. Things like this are commonplace in Hollywood. Bing Crosby and Spencer Tracy have both received many threatening letters. Many stars' phone numbers are supposed to be secret, but criminals often call to threaten them. According to the police authorities, these are not serious; their purpose is just to intimidate. Real kidnappers never bother to notify you in advance. Marlene Dietrich recently received a threatening letter in which the words were cut out one by one from newspapers and pasted together. This was perhaps a prank by a friend she knows, afraid that she would recognize the handwriting. But Marlene could not remain calm. It is said that Charlie Chaplin was kidnapped once last year, and he paid a ransom of twenty-five thousand dollars, but Charlie himself refuses to admit it.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in preventing kidnappers is that those who are eligible to be kidnapped cannot cooperate. They, especially the female stars, often receive threatening letters but are unwilling to speak out, for the sake of avoiding trouble, and secretly negotiate with the criminals. This is enough to embolden the criminals and make the situation even more serious.</p>

<h3>Humorous Anecdote of the Plaintiff Becoming the Defendant in the Paris (Nana) Lawsuit</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>Since the novel "Nana" by the French literary giant Zola was adapted into a sound film by United Artists last year, and because the lead actress was a contemporary Soviet Russian star, the film attracted much attention when it premiered. However, a lawsuit occurred in the place where the original author lived – France.</p>
<p>When "Nana" premiered in Paris, the theater was immediately served with a summons from the court to prohibit the screening. The plaintiffs were Zola's two descendants, on the grounds that the "Nana" film was too contrary to the original novel. The case has been tried several times without result, and the people of Paris have not had the pleasure of enjoying this famous French work due to legal issues.</p>
<p>Recently, the plaintiffs, believing that their victory had been achieved since the "Nana" film was banned in Paris, requested the withdrawal of the lawsuit to avoid further involvement. However, United Artists stated that it could not recognize the plaintiffs' victory, because the reason why United Artists did not premiere the "Nana" film in Paris was to allow other films to be scheduled first, and not because of any disputes that prevented the screening. United Artists demanded that the case continue to be heard, and it would definitely be able to prove that the descendants of the original author had sold the film rights to the producers, and that United Artists had the special right to screen the "Nana" film anywhere. Therefore, their lawyers wrote a complaint to Zola's descendants, saying that if they wanted to prohibit the screening of "Nana," they would have to return the 13,300 yuan in film rights fees to United Artists, but Zola's descendants have not yet responded to this complaint.</p>
<p>Because the defendant refuses to end the case and instead wants to sue the plaintiff, the Paris court believes that this case will probably be much more difficult than the case in the London court where MGM was fined for producing "Rasputin."</p>

<h3>Seeking Love and Getting a Child (Doctor Monica) (3)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Mary thought silently, and in that quiet house, all the shadows were magnified and projected on the wall, making her feel a little uneasy. If John wasn't so far away from her, the situation would be different. So she closed her eyes again and thought silently. She seemed to feel his head resting on her bosom, his arms embracing her slender waist... That night, their last night. She also seemed to hear his voice. ("You know I love you the most. Why do we always have to think about Monica? Besides, she would never want us to make a great sacrifice...") John said repeatedly. But Mary said: ("We can't make her feel pain. Besides, she is your wife. You belong to her. She is also... my friend.") The last few words were almost too low to be heard. But now John has gone far away from her. She felt loss, loneliness, and unbearable emptiness. She thought that if John could suddenly descend from the sky, then she would definitely disregard everything, even Monica, she wouldn't care. No... she thought again, Monica always cares. This endless thought circled and repeated in her mind without end. She felt unable to eliminate it, so she went to Anna's side, wanting to find a word to break this terrible silence. She asked: "Shall I pour you another glass of wine, okay?" Anna said: "No, no. I can't finish what I have here. How can I finish this work? I have to send it to the architectural exhibition tomorrow." Mary intentionally or unintentionally looked at the drawing board. She said: "Oh, is that the kind of built-in house that Monica often mentions?" Anna replied without looking up: "This is a standard model of many types. If Monica's invention gets someone's approval, then I will have something to do." "That would be great," Mary said, but without much interest. After waiting for a while, she said again: "Shall I have another drink, okay?" Anna said: "Okay, okay. You drink if you want." But she looked strangely as Mary mixed her own drink and drank it herself. She knew that Mary usually didn't drink much. At this time, Monica stood up and walked to the telephone. She said to herself: "Let me see, what is Doctor Dull's number?" She began to dial the number. Anna looked at her strangely and said: "Hmm, since when did you start discussing medical matters with that big guy?" Monica laughed: "It's not medical matters, it's my own business." Anna glanced at her, expressing her disapproval, and asked: "Are you really going to have the surgery?" Monica said: "This is the only reason why I didn't accompany John to Europe." Anna argued loudly: "I have never heard of such a strange thing." Monica had already begun to briefly talk on the phone. But she hung up the phone again, expressing great disappointment, and said: "Unbelievable! Doctor Dull has also gone out, and won't be back for a month." She returned to the stove, lit a cigarette, and said to herself: "I still wanted to get everything done this week." She said, puffing out smoke angrily: "This is really frustrating." Anna instructed from the side: "I advise you to focus on your work. Maybe you'll forget about it soon." She also stood up, lit a cigarette, and smoked. At this time, Mary took another sip of wine and huddled in a corner of the sofa. Anna said again: "It's really strange. Someone like you, I really don't understand what you need a child for?" Monica waited and said: "I have delivered so many children into this world, I should also have a right to one myself. Besides, John would definitely like it very much." (To be continued)</p>
