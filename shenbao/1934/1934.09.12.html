<p>國聯行政院通過</p>
<p>蘇俄爲常任理事</p>
<p>邀請入會電文草竣待發</p>
<p>德爲東歐公約照會各國</p>
<p>提軍備平等爲參加條件</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院今日在原則上通過歡迎蘇俄入盟並予以常任理事席、惟於蘇俄入盟手續、則意見懸殊、尙待明日續議、行政院明日秘密會議以防各國對蘇俄入會手續之異議喧騰於世、參加秘密會議者祇限數國、但將保證能得三分之二之理事人數簽字於正式請書、凡此步驟所以避免事前討論致使蘇俄爲難也、今日行政院開會時、阿根廷及葡萄牙二國宣布放棄投票、波蘭外長貝克則稱、波蘭將投贊成票、意法兩國曾爲蘇俄加入國聯先容、意國外交界贊成改造國聯、而請蘇俄入會、蓋以此爲遏制遠東危機之要著、法國則以蘇俄之入盟大可使一般情勢和緩、而使法國得藉波蘭以自重、蘇俄今巳放棄其蔑視國聯之態度、其動機則爲德日兩大勁敵旣巳退出國聯、國聯今可有助於自身矣、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今晚國聯會行政院秘密會議遲至下午六時三十分始行開會、因波蘭外長貝克等候華沙訓令故也、開會結果、除葡萄牙及阿根廷棄權以外、一致贊成蘇俄加入國聯會、並取得行政院常任席、至於邀請蘇俄入盟、將出以何種方式一層亦曾討論、但截至今晚止、尙無任何决定、在秘密會議開會之前、波蘭外長貝克在某處私人談話時、曾謂一經接到華沙訓令、卽可以正式宣言投票贊成蘇俄入盟云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院起草委員會今日巳擬定致俄電文、該電將原擬「蘇俄願遵守國聯盟約及履行國聯義務」一節删去、此乃英外相西門陳述意見之結果、蓋據西門意見、此節或將使若干國不簽字於請書、法國巳擔任向俄國接洽、務使其接受此電、有若干方面以爲蘇俄之加入國聯、可遏止日本在東方之勢力、或德國在西方之勢力、但東京官塲則不作如此想也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　希特勒政府今日以同樣之照會致與擬議中之七國公約有關係各國政府、聲稱、德國對於所謂東歐羅迦諾公約認爲實無參加之利益、並謂爲維持和平計、兩國直接訂約實勝於多邊公約、惟亦並不拒絶多邊公約之原則、然德國於軍備平等要求仍受某某國家懷疑之前、在原則上不能加入任何國際公約、故德國與他國將來之關係亦將以此立塲考慮之、德國現在處於四鄰軍備擴張之中、不得不特别愼重、故柏林方面亦不能締結條約以致牽入東歐種種衝突之漩渦、而使德國成爲戰區也云云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>蘇俄入盟問題</p>
<p>行政院决予常任席</p>
<p>入盟手續尙待研究</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　本日國聯會行政院舉行秘密會議、討論蘇聯加入國聯問題、據本社所知、經過情形約略如下、行政院開會後、先由主席捷克外長貝勒斯說明蘇聯加入種種利益、謂德日兩國退出之後、有一萬萬八千萬人口之大國贊助國聯、則國聯力量將爲之充實、波蘭外長柏克乃謂渠對於允許蘇聯加入及以行政院常任理事一席畀予蘇聯兩層、俱將投票贊成、法國外長巴爾都乃對柏克表示慶賀、至是行政院對於蘇俄入盟在原則上可謂一致通過、因阿根廷及葡萄牙兩國代表、事前業巳聲明、對於以常任理事畀予蘇聯一節、兩國將放棄投票也、巴爾都見原則上業巳通過、乃提出手續問題、卽以如何方式邀請蘇俄入盟是也、當議由大會中贊成蘇聯加入之各國代表、聯名致電莫斯科政府請其加入、惟澳洲代表勃魯斯聲明關於此層未接政府訓令、此種邀請辦法、渠本日尙不能允許贊成、英國外相西門乃請各國代表將所擬議之電文、提出研究、觀其可否在形式上加以修改、俾態度尙涉猶預之代表、易於簽字、主席貝勒斯謂手續問題關係極重、如解决不善、則政治决定之精神效果、將一部份感受影響云云、最後法國巴爾都外長乃特别聲明、行政院各國代表巳同意向大會建議、承認蘇聯加入、並願以常任理事一席畀予該國、此項决議具有確定不易之性質云云、行政院旋卽延會、手續問題當於明日由各國代表舉行私人談話解决云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇俄加入國聯會在原則上旣巳確定、現在國際人士所紛紛討論者、厥維手續問題、曩者德國入盟係由該國自行請求、土耳其墨西哥則由大會一致表决請其加入、至於此次之事、則蘇俄旣未自行請求、而大會又非一致贊成、故關於入盟手續、須於上開兩種方式之外另覔第三種辦法以解决之、本日行政院舉行秘密會議時、有人主張由大會贊成蘇俄加入之大多數會員國、聯名致電莫斯科請其加盟、此種辦法幾於通過、所擬電文除關於保障之方式而外、餘係仿照從前邀請土耳其及墨西哥入盟時所用之詞語、但英外相西門因澳洲代表未奉有該管政府訓令之故、曾請各國代表重行斟酌、原擬之稿或者尙有更動、此外斯干狄拿維亞半島各國、加拿大等國代表、對於致電邀請一層亦未明白表示贊可、大約尙需從長討論、方能定奪、總之蘇俄入盟之事、在原則上巳無問題、惟手續如何尙未决定耳、此際所可斷言者、蘇俄入盟之事、關係至爲重大、謂其裨益和平、實不爲過、傍晚時行政院主席貝勒斯演說之後、一般印象咸以爲此事雖不必故作樂觀、但絶不宜過於悲觀云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯大會原定本日午後開始總辯論、但因無一代表報告發言、故總辯論巳延期舉行、五大委貝會正在組織中、行政院若干代表於今晨會商討論邀請蘇聯加入之電文、當經提議加以修正、俾各代表易於簽字、蓋有若干代表、原擬投票贊成蘇聯加入、但不欲發電邀請、如澳洲代表勃魯斯、卽抱此種態度、加拿大代表裴納脫亦與澳洲代表相同、渠於昨晚表示、謂發電邀請有種種困難云、就今晨形勢而論、此項電文、如能改成足以滿意之形式、則加拿大之反對態度、不至如昨日之堅决、惟欲擬定最後條文、使贊成各國之代表最後簽字、則當由少數代表分頭接洽談話而後可、如是則必歷數日之久、或須至本星期杪方可實現、亦未可知、總之此一問題、其最困難之階段、業經超越、蓋蘇聯加入國聯一事、現巳切實决定、僅手續問題尙未商妥故也、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>俄波妥洽經過</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　最近華沙與莫斯科間曾進行直接談判、結果使波蘭滿意、波蘭政府曾問蘇俄政府入盟之後、該國由里加條約及由侵略國定義議定書而提供之諾言是否依舊存在、蘇俄之答復巳於今晨收到、其爲肯定性質自無疑義、且在蘇俄復文未到之前、蘇俄曾以公文致送法國代表團、法國代表當卽轉送波蘭代表團、由此項公文更可窺見蘇俄之答復必爲圓滿、波蘭之最後憂慮、可以掃除者、賴有此耳、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>大會選主席團</p>
<p>中國西班牙請連任理事</p>
<p>國聯大會已予正式接受</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯第十五屆大會午後繼續開會選出副主席六人、爲英（四十二票）、意大利（四十二票）、法（四十一票）、奥（三十八票）、及南斯拉夫（三十一票）、六國代表、各委員會之主席亦經選出、其名次列下、（一）組織及法理委員會主席波蘭代表賴辛斯基、（二）財政經濟委員會主席加拿大代表貝勒脫、（三）預算及行政委員會主席比國代表加東維亞、（四）人道及社會委員會主席阿根廷代表勒維烈、（五）政治問題委員會主席西班牙代表瑪達利伽、大會主席團現巳確定成立、此外中國要求畀予連任行政院理事之權、而西班牙亦要求連任理事、兩國請求已由大會正式收受、又匃牙利政府請求大會政治問題委員會將少數民族問題提出討論、大會各委員會現定明日開會、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院今日推選大會主席團時、突有驚人之發展、按近十年中主席團副主席一任、輒選瑞士國居之、幾以爲常、而此次瑞士竟未獲選入主席團、此事當然將令瑞士大爲不快、說者謂瑞士之被擯、半因其反對蘇俄加入國聯之故、另一原因、爲列强願見主席團領導大會一致邀請蘇俄加入國聯云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>日外務省歐察</p>
<p>蘇俄入國聯與遠東問題</p>
<p>日本專家自謂不足介意</p>
<p>（東京）　十日召開之國聯理事會秘密會議、决定對蘇聯政府承認其常任理事國之地位、蓋蘇聯政府之加入國聯巳屬確實、外務省專門家對於此項報道之見解、大致如下、（一）蘇聯政府加入國聯大致當屬確定之事實、但國聯理事會秘密會議之此項决定殊不足畏、（二）理事會秘密會議之邀請蘇聯不得卽刻由大會附表决、應由理事會將邀請情形通知蘇聯政府、候其承認、然後由大會辦理各種手續、曾經對於邀請土耳其加入國聯亦採取同樣手續、此乃國聯之慣技、（三）此次之理事會、波蘭與阿根廷同時棄權、頗惹人注目、蓋波蘭政府不欲使之成立東方本地條約、並以此爲交換條件、面默認蘇俄之加入國聯、但此種報告、外務省尙未接到來電、唯此中含有任何諒解、吾人不難揣想也、（四）此蘇俄加入國聯、對西方則可牽制德國、對東方則可牽制日本、其策略固不無此種意向、但國聯本身至今尙極形衰弱、今日之對歐問題、姑置勿論、試問蘇聯政府關於遠東問題、在國聯内部是否擁有任何策動之餘地、當爲最大疑問、在日本方面、對於此項情形自覺殊不足以介意也云云、（十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>意國表示滿意</p>
<p>俄入國聯增進國際合作</p>
<p>羅馬　日内瓦方面對於蘇聯加入國聯會之原則、巳商得一致、意大利報紙聆此消息、頗爲滿意、且認爲此舉極關重要、國際合作、倡導巳久、蘇聯加入國聯會後、可使此種合作爲之增進、並持久遠、而以在軍縮方面爲尤然、且意大利爲最初承認蘇聯之國家、故對於蘇聯加入國聯一事、斷不至不與法英兩國抱同樣態度也云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　「意大利日報」發表社論、討論日俄衝突、略謂中東鐡路之爭、乃問題之至小者、蓋雙方論價、其間相去不過四千萬圓而巳、英斯科以爲「東京政府故意刁難、使中東路談判陷於僵局、然後據爲理由、以比較猛烈之行動對待蘇俄」、該報繼稱、「在過去八個月之中、中東路一帶屢次出事、就吾人所知者、如襲擊軍營車站前後九十一次、橋樑被毁者九座、列車因軌道折毁而出軌者凡十六次、車輛之毁壞者有機關車二十一輛、其他車輛二百零七輛、因火車出事而斃命者百人、蘇俄公務員被逮者一百一十六人、事變如此之多、而地方當局毫不設法防範、此吾人所不容不注意者也、日俄之關係與歐洲息息相關、非歐洲人所能漠視者、日本人之伸拳攘臂、與德國人態度相同、若干人以爲兩國之間容有默契存焉、東歐互助公約足以保障蘇俄在歐洲方面之邊界、而德國拒絶之、此與日本反俄活動之再度發動、不能無關係也、總之、太平洋衝突之發展、其責任不在蘇俄、當國聯會虚位以待之時、蘇俄詎能在東方挑動無益之糾紛乎、且蘇俄與其西方各鄰國巳簽訂多數互不侵犯條約、其外交政策志在和平、可以槪見矣、蘇俄空軍力量現巳極端發展、吾人希望蘇俄空軍不必用於危險而又無益之衝突、此種種突如不幸發生、則歐洲未有不受其影響者也」云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英作家之非難</p>
<p>蘇俄加入國聯</p>
<p>影響國聯精神</p>
<p>（倫敦）　查恩武男爵曾投函泰晤士報、論蘇俄加入國聯事、巳於今日揭載、内稱、國聯容納蘇俄加入、實爲公然廢棄國聯創立人之主義與志願、此雖非爲顯明宗敎性質、而對各事實竭力維護人道、蘇俄任意殘害民衆、運動世界革命、以奴隷工作於伐木場、凡此行爲皆大反國聯之精神與盟約、故容納蘇俄加入國聯、實爲公然廢棄國聯所依以創立之原則、或爲將國聯轉成有組織的僞善團體云、按查恩武男爵頗多著作、内有林肯傳及前美總統羅斯福傳等書、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　前喬治亞駐法公使今日抗議蘇俄加入國聯、謂蘇俄莊重承認喬治亞獨立之後、甫隔九月、卽改佔喬治亞、時爲一九二一年、事實具在、不能隱飾云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>德國照會内容</p>
<p>暗示承認軍備平等</p>
<p>加入東歐公約條件</p>
<p>（柏林）　法國政府提議之東歐互助公約、本年七月初經法國外長巴爾都前往倫敦接洽之後、取得英國同意、當由英政府通告各國徵求意見、頃德國政府巳將該國對此約之態度通知各關係國、據德意志通信社宣稱、德國政府致各國政府公文、略謂「德國之軍備平等權、若一日因若干國家之態度而發生疑問、則德國在原則上卽一日不能參加此類國際條約、此種見解、對德國與國聯會之未來關係、亦適用之、東歐互助公約、規定參加國家有以兵力互相援助之義務、此種計畫、與國聯盟約之制裁條欵相聯、然德國有種種不可戰勝之困難、每次國際談判時輒反復言之、有此困難、則互助條約計畫殊覺難實現、蓋德國四周皆爲軍備强大之國家、如德國加入此項條約則東歐一有衝突、德國必被牽入、且將使德國成爲戰塲、此非德國所能承認者、東歐互助公約又特别規定法國受攻擊、則蘇俄擔保、蘇俄受攻擊、則法國擔保、德國以爲由政治上言之、實際並無如此擔保之必要、總之德國對於互助公約之保障、不能希望有任何利益、德國政府以爲如欲維持和平、尙有其他方法可以採用、收效或可較大、德國比較贊成雙方條約、但對於多方條約並不反對、不過訂立多方條約時、當使各國以不侵犯爲義務、且遇衝突時、應由各關係國互相諮商、以求解决、而不當於條約中規定遇有戰爭時、须自動地以兵力互相援助也、互不侵犯及互相諮商、不問採用如何方式、皆於維持和平有實際效力、依此辦法、旣可以和平手段避免戰爭、而同時又無引起重大糾紛之危險、至於現在各國所主張之東歐互助公約、其用意固在維持和平、但其結果、將不免發生糾紛」云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>我國取締銀交易</p>
<p>與貿易之影響</p>
<p>倫敦東京之觀測</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦現正紛紛討論中國之取締白銀買賣、財政家對於此舉之影響、多不能决定意見、迄今衆皆以爲中國僅售其過剩之存銀、蓋以銀價甚高藉求自利耳、但長此出售、必將使存底爲枯、終將害及其内國貿易、此爲其第一關心事也、財政家咸謂今一切端賴外國銀行之合作、如外國銀行束手旁觀、則必引起嚴重之政治問題、故給予合作實無可疑、如美國繼續購買、中國不肯售出、則銀價之上趨、似爲自然之結果、乃美國邇來所購甚微、致使中國之决議失其功效、而於一般銀價無甚影響、再中國對金業交易所所施之取締、如發生效力、則極有關於遏制投機、而可使匯兌益爲穩固、此實商人所欣慰者、惟有人現信中國投機者之動作、今將移向倫敦與孟買二處、故一般人以爲中國之計畫、欲求有實效可覩、必尙需時日也、（字林報九月十八日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）　中國財政部發布限制外匯取締投機命令之情報到東京後、日本銀行副總裁深井氏發表如次談話、中國政府因中國匯兌市塲以現銀投機爲中心、故慮及其影響之重大、出於今次最後手段、當局應取締流出國外之物（卽現銀）或應取締現銀流出之原因（卽匯兌）、係一問題、中國政府似因取締匯兌較易實施、故有此舉、取締内容若如德國嚴重則無問題、然上海投機界極爲複雜、實行取締必生種種困難、倫敦銀市騰漲、則於貿易原則上以現銀缺賬比匯兌缺賬有利、故不得阻止、現銀流出、中國實施取締外匯、中日貿易不致受其影響云云、（十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（南京）　財部某員云、本部取締標金投機、及限制外匯買賣後、一部金融界頗示不安、聞有要求變更現行辦法說、惟政府之立塲、認交易所年來所營事業、影響金融、無益社會、因之决心取締、任何請求、政府恐不能變更巳定辦法（十一日專電）</p>

<h3 id="c1">敬告本屆國聯大會 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>廷</p>
<p>當茲國聯大會改選行政院非常任理事之前夕。吾人改掬誠昭告出席大會之友邦代表。我國自有連任之理由。</p>
<p>（一）中國爲首先參加國聯組織之一員。且爲最富於擁護熱忱之一員。以上口言。佔世界總數四之一。以疆域言。佔亞洲面積四之一。以文明言。垂亘五千年。廣被數萬里。又爲世界萬國所推崇者。有一於此。巳足與當世先進諸國分庭抗禮。雖進而要求國聯行政院常任理事之一席。亦毫無媿色。今若并一非常任理事而勿予。則中國朝野必將感覺深厚之失望。可以斷言。</p>
<p>（二）九一八事變旣起。中國以信賴國聯故。未卽出以積極之抵抗。而國聯亦竟無法以裁制日本之暴行。設中國在當時失望之餘。而退出國聯。則其所加於國聯之打擊。必將倍蓰於日本之退盟。然中國寗願曲意諒解。以與國聯相始終。其犧牲之慘酷。迴護之周至。在若許會員國中。實鮮其儔。今茲中國要求連任行政院之非常任理事。更足見其重視國聯之至意。若此區區而不能得。則國聯所蒙之損失。必遠過於中國。蓋中國不獲行政院理事。初無損於其國格。而行政院無中國代表。則將缺乏溝通西方與東方之連鎖。而降爲純粹的代表歐洲利益之結合。不幸而至此。則國聯之眞價值。亦僅耳。</p>
<p>（三）國聯對華之技術合作。實由行政院主其成。而日本四一七聲明書。則己暴露其無理恫嚇之能事矣。行政院與中國雙方。在日本嚴重反對之下。固利害一致休戚相關者也。今後技術合作之成否。實有待於行政院與中國共同之努力。若在此緊要關頭。而竟使中國在國聯之地位感受影響。固非中國之福。亦豈國聯之利。</p>
<p>（四）誠如中國代表郭泰祺氏言。大會曾屢次表示。非常任理事之選舉。應對各國疆域之大小加以合宜考慮。而對亞洲尤應使春在行政院席上有充分之代表。今日與我競爭亞洲方面之代表席者。厥爲土耳其。土國之疆域。固遠遜於我。而其爲一歐洲性之國家。且爲其請求書中所自認。是其不能有與我競選之資格。彰彰明甚。而中國之應連任理事。更何疑乎。</p>
<p>（五）昨日大會開幕。臨時主席貝奈斯力言遠東局勢之不容漠視。中國向爲遠東之第一大國。自日本退盟後。其在國聯代表遠東之資格。更無有敢與爭衡者。比者。蘇俄加盟。已成事實。計其影響所及。將有造於遠東局面之奠定。殆爲識者所公認。聞蘇俄加盟。乃以當選行政院常任理事爲條件之一。今若在行政院中添一常任理事之蘇俄。而去一非常任理事之中國。在中國固不免於向隅之憾。而爲奠定遠東局面計。又適見其不澈底耳。故在今日蘇俄加盟聲中。更有使中國連任理事之必要。庶幾中俄兩國。在正常外交關係以外。復有一相與携手之塲所。以謀遠東之和平也。</p>

<p>俄路員續被捕</p>
<p>備受毒刑逼供</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　哈爾濱來訊、中東路被捕蘇籍路員親屬、因被捕者處境苦難、故對彼等之運命至爲焦慮、自彼等備受痛打與嚴刑之事實宣露後、此種憂慮益形加甚、日滿當局不准彼等會客、並不得收受饋贈食物、據稱、彼等於審訊時如不照說對方所必需之謊言、則必嚴受毒刑、令其「供認」蘇聯駐哈總領對此等事實、復向滿洲當局作有力之陳述、</p>
<p>哈埠另訊、日滿當局在中東路上之越軌行動、及無故逮捕蘇聯路員之舉、仍然繼續、九月四日日兵曾於烏古諾爾站强佔站長辦公室及職員住宅、作爲屯營、蘇民墨斯太發之妻以不肯讓出、致遭痛打、嗣經滿洲里蘇領抗議、日兵遂自辦公室及職員住宅離去、</p>
<p>滿洲里站站長蘇民沙勃林司基於九月六日被捕、蘇領立向當局堅决抗議、同日蘇民秣伐倫戈及其妻與弟亦遭逮捕、嗣於翌日釋放、蘇民戈林爲一駛機員、曾於八月五日列車出事時被匪徒綁去、九月六日乘間逃回行抵蕭九莊（譯音）據戈氏云、列車售票員蘇民伊凡諾夫與彼同時被綁、因遭匪毒打、巳於八月十一日去世、九月四日有售票員塔文科夫之子、及醫院職員伊湼科夫司基之子、在橫道河子站被匪綁去、</p>

<p>改革治僞機關</p>
<p>日首相折衷案</p>
<p>表面尊重外省提案</p>
<p>實際仰承軍部意旨</p>
<p>拓務省失實權不滿</p>
<p>（東京）　河田書記官製定之政府辭滿機關改革案、内容如此、</p>
<p>（一）「滿洲國」現狀、外部有對華對俄關係、内部有國内治安問題、尙未到達實施文政時期、拓務省案雖爲完備之文政案、然現在未便實施、故不得不暫時採用軍政制度、</p>
<p>（二）駐滿大使由内閣總理大臣管理、以計舉國一致形式之强化、然關於純粹外交事勢、則由外務大臣監督、</p>
<p>（三）關東州由行政沿革而論、理應置於拓務省管理之下、然因該地扼「滿洲國」咽喉、地勢重要、應由駐滿特殊機關管理、　　（四）中央設立對滿事務局、以爲對滿政策機關、（十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日閣議後、岡田首相因改革在滿機關問題、請求林陸相與廣田外相共留討論、當時提出個人主張之折衷案、接受該案之林廣田兩相、其時並未答復、卽辭返官邸、雙方均開省議、由首腦部間繼續檢討恊議、惟兩省對折衷案似頗有不滿、故其到達妥恊、恐相當困難、（十一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　拓務省對於岡田首相所提出之折衷案、因向來直轄拓省之關東州行政權·滿鐡附屬地之行政權·滿鐡及電報電話並特殊公司之監督權等、對滿政策内之重要項目悉被剝奪、所餘者僅拓殖意義、致將來對滿政策之重要時、完全失却發言權、拓務省等於廢物、故拓務省全省表示絶對反對、（十一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　（十一日）外務·陸軍·拓務·等三省對於内閣製成之折衷案、其態度大致分别如左、</p>
<p>「外務省方面」如命令系統依照現在情形、則大致贊成折衷案、對於不甚滿足之一二件、今後設法折衝而期解决、</p>
<p>「陸軍省方面」現在雖未明白表示其贊否之態度、但對於折衷案、大致以爲承認陸軍所主張、故不甚反對、</p>
<p>「拓務省方面」根據此案則拓務省僅剩餘其移民事業之監督權、此種情形故甚爲悲觀也、（十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>德禁日絲進口</p>
<p>日本擬施報復</p>
<p>（東京）　德國政府本年四月公布日本人造絲進口分配令、規定以一九三一年之貿易狀態爲標準、限定日本人造絲之進口數爲其七成半、日本因一九三一年之人造絲對德出口殆無其數、德政府之分配令等於禁止令、業於五月十七日訓令駐德大使永井、以違返最惠國條約之理由、要求德政府變更標準年度、然德政府六日致答永井大使、德國因與第三國有恊定、不能接收日本要求、日外務省恐此事對日德貿易之影響重大、考慮對策、擬發動通商擁護法作爲報復（十一日日聯）</p>

<p>東京市電車大罷工（日本通信）</p>
<p>經濟組織的破綻</p>
<p>勞資衝突的一面</p>
<p>日本近年以來、頗自命是超越於世界經濟恐慌範圍之外、其受軍需工業的恩惠特别巨大、對外輸出貿易又向上增加不巳、日本的景氣、似乎可以興旺了、但是實質上並未見得這樣的樂觀、軍需工業的好處、祗有一部分資本家受到、其餘都還有感着經營困難、至於一般勞苦大衆和薪俸生活的人、莫不痛感經濟恐慌、生活困苦的呼聲到處都可以聽到、如此情形、在軍國主義統制之下、公開的言論自由被剝削了、所以在新聞雜誌上輕易不見反抗的記載、而破敗的經濟狀况、也就暫時的彌縫著、</p>
<p>東京市電氣局受病之深、巳不自今日始、其營業的虧損、有兩萬萬餘日金、本年預算「赤字」計八百六十萬元、這些困難都是無法克服的、於是由東京市當局决定大加整理、以减低工人薪金來彌補、但减工資是難於實行的、所以先行裁員、計職員方面裁去三百八十人、工人裁去一萬零一百二十九人、至於新舊工資的比較、電車賣票夫約减百分之四四、開車夫約减百分之四十五、信號夫减百分之四八、汽車（女）售票人减百分之二十、汽車夫减百分之三○、電燈雇工减百分之四一、因而惹起工人方面的大衝動、一則是解職的人數太多、一則是將來生活毫無保障、</p>
<p>於是東京交通勞動組合一致議决、向電氣局提出要求書、其内容爲此次電氣局發表的大整理案、是要强制全體工作人</p>
<p>回該案」、電氣局方面態度是非常强硬、從牛塚東京市長對市會的演說裏可以窺見、他說道、「如果讓市電財政就這樣下去、祗有陷於潰減之一途、我們鑑於市民的福祉和事業的使命、不得巳而下重大的决心、從事於整理、我確信如得到諸君的恊助、實現此項計劃、則市電財政前侘就可得一更生之路」、由此可見對立形勢的嚴重了、</p>
<p>九月初一二就吵得很厲害、雙方都在作臨戰的準備、電氣局方面則準備如何實行整理、如何對付勞工、東京交通組合則準備如何訴諸市民的公判、如何團結工人、預備罷工時期的戰時組織和戰用資金、政府當局則準備防止工人的不穩行動、同時更嚴厲取締共産黨和全國勞動恊會的活動、决不許極左派加入、凡是合法勞動團體、而作非法活動的、也嚴加取締、更不准有妨害電車汽車的進行、及營業所和車庫的安全、</p>
<p>經過了這紛紛醖釀之後、東京交通勞動組合、遂於九月四日午後一時、宣告總罷工、其所爭的是反對削减工資、反對一萬一千人的解職、用總罷工來促起當局的覺悟、</p>
<p>這樣一來、東京全市的交通、豈不要完全停頓、電氣局方面仍準備維持交通、呌職員中凡是能開電車汽車的都下令動員、至於賣票員、則於職員之外、更求援於靑年團員、並下令徵求各區調查有開電車技能者、卽行報告、以備採用、</p>
<p>五日早晨、工人們果然實行總罷工了、在五點鐘的時候、運動的電車不過比平常少八架、到了六點、就比平常少四十一架、到午前九點鐘的時候、就少了三百三十六架了、公共汽車則减少了七十二架、因此各車站·各交义點·等車的人都擁擠不堪、並且新來的一般車夫、有的是較高級人員、有的是普通職員、平日整齊的東京交通、竟混雜得一榻糊塗、那些人員又都不習於工作、車子開得不好是小事、而且到處都發生障碍、一般市民非常的不安、可是一萬二千多參加罷工的人員團結非常之堅固、都在東京交易組合領導之下一致行動、輿論界多表示好感、不過電氣局也確有其苦衷、這正是日本整個經濟破綻的一面、又同是社會問題的焦點哩、（九月六日於東京）</p>

<p>九江</p>
<p>經濟衰落槪况</p>
<p>出口减少三倍</p>
<p>市面百業蕭條</p>
<p>九江通信、記者頃由牯嶺抵潯、作一日之勾留、見聞所及、槪述如次、</p>
<p>九江全市周圍十二里、計一萬九千零六十八戶、人口七萬七千二百六十二人、（内有外僑一二二人）較鼎盛時代之十二萬人口、减少三分之一、市政委員會新近成立、主任委員爲李中襄、各馬路如大中路等、頗爲整潔、火車站及江邊碼頭、秩序尙佳、全市收入、房捐車捐等項、月約三四千元、尙不敷警政費、市府一切開支、則由省府補助、而事業費無着、此時只能從事於整理耳、</p>
<p>該市工業、首屈一指者、爲久興紗廠、資産額二百萬兩、全年用棉五萬担上下、大部爲贛北産、日出紗五十包、年約萬六千餘包、行銷内地、營業無甚起色、裕生火柴公司、資額定三百萬元、（不知巳收足否）出品甲種有江西地球與飛鳥牌、乙種爲童馬與蘆雁、每日生産額約五十箱、行銷湘鄂贛内地、前因瑞典火柴傾銷、頗受影響、自各大火柴公司合組爲中華火柴公司、該公司担任三省供給後、營業雖不見如何之佳、然外貨入口者漸少、亦抵制外貨之生力軍也、紐扣物品雖微、每年輸入亦在二百萬元、而輸入鉅額、日本所用原料之蚌壳、多爲太湖及鄱陽湖等地供給、九江近湖、爲此項工業之良好發展地、現九江製扣車頭大小在二百部左右、</p>
<p>九江商業、日就衰落、有如江河日下、錢業在過去五年中、歇業錢莊達十八家之多、僅於二十年新增一家、其餘各業、倒歇者數字亦至可驚、現在仍是外强中乾、虚有其表、大中路一帶、爲最繁盛之區、大都門可羅雀、商業雖然不振、而生活程度反日高、開消日大、此所以虧蝕倒閉不知伊于胡底也、據熟悉九江情形者談、潯市經濟衰落、（一）江西匪禍八年、生産機能衰退、經潯出口特産、如瓷器·夏布·竹木·紙張·鎢礦·米穀·等等、以前每項、數極可觀、今均一落千丈、不堪回首、潯海關出口統計、民十七年爲三千九百餘萬兩、二十一年降至一千三百餘萬兩、相差三倍、致以前數十家報關轉運業、今巳無所事事、經營出口押欵者、更無論矣、（二）前去兩年、長江水災、社會購買力低落、（三）贛北·鄂南·皖西南·三省交界、因連年匪禍、交通阻梗、商旅裹足、（四）産銷稅開征後、進出口各貨、征百分之二五至十五、物價自然隨之增高、故有出口貨物、多迂道走别處、而贛鄂皖三省邊區各縣鎭集、以前來潯作負販者、轉而之武穴安慶、或遠道漢口販運、以避該捐、刻産捐業巳取銷、而進口貨之銷捐、則尙須營業稅發達、方能全撤也、基於以上各因、所以九江市面之日趨蕭條、商民無不呌苦連天、</p>
<p>江西今年全省旱災、贛南最輕、贛北最重、潯瑞武星都永湖彭各縣、早晚禾苗、均旱死十之七八、農民自殺者、日有所聞、都昌縣城、無升斗交易、星子每人限購米兩升、九江市米價、曾達十四元、經市政委員會維持得力、購西貢米調劑、壓倒至十一元以下、然而鄉村之苦况、則匪夷所思矣、（九月三日）</p>

<p>蘇省位於黄海之濱　中貫長江、向稱東南當庶之區、亦沿海重要之地、自京滬鐡路完成後、江南日漸繁盛、洎乎今日航道公路、縱橫幾遍、與鐡路相輔而行、交通益臻便利、至於江北雖地大物博、人口衆多、水陸交通均感缺乏、以致行旅難艱、貨運每逢水沽冰凍之時、雖帆船亦不能行駛、工商因而不振、百業因而停滯、本地紳商有鑒於此、故有興築口岸至泰縣公路之議、惟是口泰一所範圍狹小、實不足以資應用、因擬將口泰綫展長至東臺、以接近鹽墾區域、使增加効能、本年七月蘇建廳派技術人員踏勘此口東路綫、並調查沿綫客貨情形後、始知江北人民之來往口岸者、每日平均約三四千人、貨物之由口岸出入者、每日平均約二三千噸、該路完成後、以低廉之運費、任重致遠、其客貨運輸之增加、更可想見、比諸國營各鐡路、實有過之無不及、查口岸至東臺路長八十公里、地勢平坦、施工極易、一年之内、即可完成、全綫建築經費計需三百萬元、擬向滬上各大銀行籌措、分期歸還、現先行測量、一俟籌有的欵、再行開工、此路屬蘇省交通最要部份、亦江北繁榮所繫、該路通車後、如以口岸以輪渡過江作支綫、以達丹陽、與京滬路啣接、則大江南北、更可聯成一氣矣、</p>

<p>金業</p>
<p>交易所昨開市</p>
<p>楊蔭溥談銀行外匯與標金之關係</p>
<p>新聲社云、財政部命令限制國外匯兌取締標金投機後、前日金業交易所因之停市、經議定辦法後、昨晨卽照常開市、市况甚平、新聲社記者、昨晨特往訪經濟學專家楊蔭溥、叩訊銀行國外匯兌部與標金市塲之關係、及標金結價之情形、錄誌於下、</p>
<p>楊蔭溥談調劑匯兌</p>
<p>前國立上海商學院長楊蔭溥氏昨對往訪之新聲社　者談、我國爲用銀國家、面其他國家之貨幣、均以金計算、美匯或英匯之漲落、與標金市場之價格、大致相同、故銀行國外匯兌部、如開出數萬美金匯票、而當時並無此項美匯存儲、苟翌日美匯驟漲、則銀行將蒙受損失、故爲避免危險計即向標金市塲購進相當金條、至交割時、以美匯結價、無論漲落、經營國外匯兌者、均可不蒙損失、如標金買賣、必以現貨交割、因英美現在均非實際金本位、故金價與外匯、其上落之比例、並不相若、則國外匯兌必另籌有以調劑之方、否則勢必縮小營業、以免危險、</p>
<p>交易所買賣非投機</p>
<p>交易所中做套頭者、固有投機者攙雜其間、但銀行外匯部則絶非投機、蓋求减少風險、勢所必然也、如麵粉廠購進大批小麥後、如必至磨面麵粉後始售出、則數月之後、市價或有大漲落、其售價或在成本以下、故廠方爲减少此種危險計、即在麵粉交易所抛出麵粉期貨、以粉價麥價在同一時期、相差較少也、至紗布等情形亦同、故交易所之存立、實有其需要、但其他非製造廠而買空賣空者則始爲投機矣、</p>
<p>改換標準差額减小</p>
<p>記者繼詢標金結價辦法、與今昔不同之點、楊氏答、標金價格向以日元結算、九一八後改以美金計算、即標金一條（十兩）、合美金三百四十六元、現在改用倫敦金塊價爲標準、（即關金·因關金即以金塊價計算也）即標金一條、合海關金單位五百零七元八分之七、以今日市價言、美匯爲三四元八分之七、（合國幣百元）以之計算金價、每條合九百九十二元、關金爲一元九二六、合金價爲每條九百七十八元、而今日金價爲九百五十六元、以之與新舊標凖結價比較、美匯差額爲三十六元、關金差額、則僅二十二元、减小三分之一强、</p>
<p>國際滙兌新標準</p>
<p>中央銀行昨正式掛牌</p>
<p>滙兌上標準價格視綫</p>
<p>由匯豐而移轉至中央</p>
<p>爲金融史上最有意義之一頁</p>
<p>申時社云、自九日財部發佈取締標金投機、交易均須一律現金結價之命令後、前日金業及物品金業部份、兩均停止交易、開會討論善後辦法、結果、巳與財部商妥、以關金爲結價標準、但關金亦一假定單位、仍須依據倫敦金塊價格換算、現中央銀行巳於昨日起、每日早晨將標金標準價格、及關金價格、正式掛牌、國際匯兌標準、如美元·先令·法郎·羅比·等之價格、以前均以匯豐掛牌爲標準、上海匯兌市塲、歷史相沿、幾成慣例、無敢或違、自中央銀行創設後、雖亦效法各國中央銀行之機能、以擴張權力、亦如匯豐有標準換價牌示、但在市塲慣例上、仍以匯豐掛牌爲標準、中央牌示、等於具文、且標金之標準價格、在過去無論匯豐與中央、壛無牌示、一任交易所開盤漲落、自昨日起、中央銀行依據倫敦金塊價格、牌示標凖價格、爲（一）每市平標金一條、（十兩）合關金五百零七單位、七九合銀元九百七十八元、（二）每一金單位合銀元一元九角二分六厘、從此匯兌視綫、由匯豐而移轉於中央、中央對於匯兌上之機能擴大、而爲管理匯兌之初步成功、實爲金融史最可紀念之一頁、自十一月十五以後、金交結價、亦以中央牌示新標準爲依據、使匯兌比價差額縮小、市面自能穩定云、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>這邊的汽車，在兩條跳板上，另外開上了一隻渡船，大家也跟了上去。船艄上高懸着一顆彎木料作的催艄櫓，當了尾舵，一個老者扶了。此外三個人，各拿了一根彎彎曲曲的木料在那其長三尺的艄上，來回走着撑。此外有兩個人，脫得赤條條，跳在水裏，扶了船頭進行。那二人有時上船，對了大衆，却也並不介意。常秘書笑道：這裏就是渭水了，姜子牙吊魚，就在上流。對面岸上，有塊木牌坊，寫了咸陽古渡四個字。程志前笑道：我想這渡船，由秦始皇的時候起，直到現在，也許還保持着那種作風。對於這個古字，是可當之而無愧的。汽車坐了這渡船過河，這楫新的還得仰仗了這極舊的，想一想，眞有趣。大家都笑了。人在船面上說笑着，看看咸陽古城，渭河古水，望兩岸平原無邊，只是那無古今的太陽照着，却也讓人生出一番感慨。這渡船在水上是麻煩了四十分鐘，才到了彼岸。汽車登了岸，繞過了咸陽北邊，半角士城，向北飛跑。這裏巳慢慢的到了高原，向前看看，只覺平地遠遠高上去，常是在平原中間，湧起幾個大士堆。據常秘書說，那都是周漢以來的古墳。墳前不但没一棵樹，連一片靑草也没有。程志前不覺歎一聲道：莫謂秦無人，天實爲之，謂之何哉？常秘書就是本省人，聽他這話，和陜西人表示同情。而且用成句，又非常渾成。便拱拱手道：我這裏替陜西人謝謝了。程志前道：並非我胡亂恭維陜西人，我想到大自然的力量，不容易抵抗，越覺得秦國人以前有魄力，怎麽會以這裏爲基礎，併呑六匣了呢？（一七）</p>
<h3 id="c8">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這些人物，也許便是中國古代各種舊小說中，和其他各處張掛着的故事畫上所畫着的人物，重復回生過來，特地來向我們的太后殷勤致敬。</p>
<p>雖然這樣踵事增華的佈置，巳在太后的面前，很齊整地展露開來了，可是太后的心上是否巳經認爲滿意，却還在不可知之數例！伊對於這些官吏，此次前來接駕的眞意，我想必然是十二分明瞭的。因爲伊也知道天津這一帶的官吏，决不會比别處的特别好；他們一般也是化了錢，或利用了其他的關係，—如親屬關係，裙帶關係等等而弄到這些美缺的。他們旣無學問，又無才幹，於國於民，眞是兩無所利。但他們倒有一副極善逢迎的腦子，所以他們也把給太后接駕的這一件事，看做是一種保全飯碗，鞏固地位的必不可少的手段；有些更懷着要借這一個機會，取到幾許意外的利益的奢望。總之，在他們的一羣中間，簡直没有一個人是誠心爲着要向太后請安而來的！他們都抱着很濃的自私心，隱隱有所企圖，便是袁世凱本人，也不能例外！</p>
<p>我一見了袁世凱，便禁不住起了一重異樣的感覺，使我自己的腦神筋，立刻停頓在一片沉思默索的狀態中，儘自呆怔怔地看着他。—這個脚色，就是辛亥年革命成功以後的中華民國的第一任大總統。在那時候，他一般也是恭而敬之的跪在天津月台上，迎接太后，誰想到他將來會有這麽一番的作爲？老實說，他自己也絶對没有夢見咧——我一面像端詳一頭久巳聞名，而從未見面的怪物一樣地注視着他；一面在回想過去的種種事件，就是怎樣能使他成名的種種事件。（一二六）</p>
<h3 id="c9">曾子固不能作詩 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 花病鶴</p>
<p>湧幢小品，載淵材生平所恨五事：一恨　魚多骨，二恨金橘多酸，三恨蓴菜性冷，四恨海棠無香，五恨曾子固不能作詩。關於曾子固究竟能詩與否？可惜我没有讀過他的全集。但張其昀的西湖風景史一文裏面，（見東方雜誌西湖博覽會號）有載字固的西湖納凉詩云：</p>
<p>「問呈何處避炎蒸，十頃西湖照眼明；魚戲一篙浪滿，鳥啼千樹綠陰成。</p>
<p>虹腰隱隱松橋出，鷁首峨峨畫舫行；最喜晚凉風月好，紫荷香裏聽泉聲。」</p>
<p>也許是子固並不是不會做詩，不過是不工而巳。</p>
<p>黄庭堅說：「讀書欲純不欲博。」可謂是讀書的要訣。子固文章的簡潔，和蘇東坡的奔放，固然各有千秋。但因其天才不及東坡好，所以詩詞，不及東坡都能當行出色。惟其如此，適足見其能用其所長，藏其所拙。不似今人忽而寫平平仄仄的舊詩，忽而寫妹妹哥哥的新詩，以自炫其博學多才。</p>
<p>今人不但做文章詩詞的如此，更有許多人，昨天研究農礦，今天研究化學，明天研究政治，後天研究軍事，幾乎無一不曾涉獵。究其實際，却一無所成。滑稽者稱爲萬能博士。然而比較子固窮其畢生精力，從事研究文章，得能躋在唐宋八大文家之列，未免令人有「古今人常不相及」的感想。</p>
<p>最後更結吾論曰：中國在此缺乏專門人才的狀態下，我人希望寗可少一萬能博士，多一善讀書的曾子固。</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>前些日子，看到梅雪君經過淸華，交大，浙大三次入學試騐而减少好幾磅體重的那篇文字，使我感到無限的同情。</p>
<p>這麽大熱天，悶在考塲裏一門一門的受着艱深的試騐，眞不是「生意經」，體重銳减確是應有的現象！</p>
<p>可是，各大學壘積着幾千本考卷，看卷子的也委實無法制止其頭痛，但他們的體重據說並不受到影響，因爲考卷中有許多足以引得他們發笑的資料。笑，是一般地認爲有益身心的！</p>
<p>這批「笑料」，數，理，化，史地，各門考卷内都有，但它的質量遠不及國文考卷中的豐富。中國人考國文能貢獻這許多「笑料」，是該笑出眼淚來的！</p>
<p>譬如吧，「尸位素餐這句文言，有人會把它翻成「死屍面前桌子上供着一盆素菜」的白話，堪稱「幼婦黄絹」！據說，看國文考卷的夏季本來茹素，但看到這本考卷，脾胃大開，爲之勉進肥肉數箸。</p>
<p>某私立大學國文試題中有「…歷舉十三經之名稱…」這項測騐，某生寫的是「天經，地經，水經，火經……神經……」不足十三之數。但他没有把月經寫上去，此公腹内，究竟欠通！</p>
<p>還有「莊暴見孟子」翻成的一篇白話。原文中有句「王之好樂，則齊國其庶幾乎」，作者寫的是：「大王這樣的喜歡尋快樂，齊國是眞正不得了矣」！堪稱奇論。但撇了「孟子」的原文，這句白話並不能說它不通，且一經咀嚼，自有一股「蒿目時艱，憂心國事」的幽情，流露齒頰間，作者殆亦有心人哉！一笑。</p>

<p>去年，國府林主席蒞崑，因慕名崑山鴨麵的鮮美，曾在興學路中央酒菜館吃過一次。因此，崑山的鴨麵，便引起吃客的注意。</p>
<p>而且，吃的價目也貴。一塊鴨，祗售十二個銅圓，一碗麵，也不過銅元二十六枚，便可飽吃一頓。假使你要多吃幾塊鴨，那末，不妨呌他添上幾塊。吃不完，照數計算，他們是很遷就的。這種價廉物美的吃，眞是再經濟没有了。</p>

<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>學生在學校裏上課有時間表，纔能按步就班的得到相當的學識，我們在家庭裏裝飾和美容，也要定一張時間表，纔能按步就班的得到相當的效果。最近有位外國的修飾專家，發表了一張一週的修飾時間表，支配得很好，現在譯述出來，貢獻給讀者作參考。他所支配的如下：星期一，實行面部與頸部的按摩。星期二，洗澡之後，施行全身橄欖油的按摩。星期三，修指甲。星期四，處理雞眼，（假使没有雞眼，不妨改爲别種處理，如翦趾甲等）。星期五，施行頭皮按摩和擦洗，（這種擦洗，祗能隔兩星期施行一次，如非你的頭髮是特别的滑膩多油，纔可每週擦洗一次）星期六，整理頭髮，星期日修指甲。根據這位專家說，假使我們嚴守他所定的修飾時間表，繼續不斷的實行，那麽我們的姿容一定能彀日日增進，天天加美。</p>
<p>上述的修飾時間表，若不加以簡要的說明，不足以使人深信，所以這位專家還附有一篇綱要，大槪是這樣說：你曾經在晚上洗了澡從浴盆裏出來的時候，或者從戶外運動之後回進來的時候，覺得異乎尋常的快樂與舒服嗎？你的臉兒發熱呈紅色，你的肌肉覺得很鬆弛，你的神經似乎有抑制。你奔進你的臥室去，到鏡子前去照一照，那麽你要大失所望咧。原來你所要看見的晶潔明亮的眼晴，毫無瑕疵的皮膚，和生動活潑的容貌，都看不到，但只見一副不淸不爽的面孔，蓬蓬鬆鬆的頭髮；不過這個身軀，却依舊是你每天人們見了讚爲美麗的身軀罷了。這爲什麽？就爲了缺少修飾的原故。</p>
<p>衣　你曾經想着過這種能彀達到上述目的的事嗎？衣服，當然，是很重要的。不妨去試試，預備兩天件裝飾品，但不要使它們重覆。你的手袋無論如何要玲瓏雅緻，美麗整潔。有許多女子很不興，不是胡亂地穿着，便是携帶肥腫的手袋，因爲袋中東西裝得過分多，連袋口都敞開着，露出一層汚穢不堪，粗糙無比的夾裏來。這種是不雅觀的，考究美的人，連這種小東西也要考究的。小東西的手袋，知道考究，那麽大東西的衣服，不會不考究了。</p>
<p>手　現在要講到人們異口同聲地讚許的美容術了。照你的見解看起來，一個女子考究美容的時候，那一件事最容易忽略？以我個人而論，要把「手」放在第一的。不論你做家庭雜務啊，洗滌兒童衣服啊，或者僅是從外面買了東西回來洗手啊，總要常用一種品質好的肥皂。那麽，皮膚完全乾後，用一種可靠的潤手香水，但不要擦得過分重。潤膚霜和淨膚霜，用來擦在手上，和搽在面上，有同等的許多益處。</p>
<p>面　現在有許多人知道當心面部的皮膚了，因此由經騐而得到相當正確的美容術；但你曾想到過你的面部表情，笑容嗎？走到你的鏡子邊去，做出一種笑容來，或者一天你在發笑的時候，走到鏡子邊去看看。所得的結果是不是你所想像的？大槪不是的。那麽再來試試，看你能彀得到那一種你認爲最滿意的結果。無論如何，總要十分忠實，不嫌麻煩地尋出你自己的弱點來，或者去請一個朋友來帮助你，打定主意把一切弱點改善。並檢查你置放裝飾品美容品的抽屜，把毫無用處的東西丢掉。有幾種霜啊，膏啊，粉啊，不見得適合你的皮膚；有幾種香水，不見得適合你的性質；那麽還是把它們送回來的地方去吧！</p>
<p>列位姊姊妹妹；您們要修飾儘管修飾好了，不過修飾所需要的一切的一切，非用國貨不可。若是濫用舶來品，那麽還是不修飾爲妙，任是亂頭粗服，也不要緊。—編者—</p>

<h3 id="c15">民族復興中之公民敎育問題（六）章淵若 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>（二）培養社會德性　要培養社會德性、須注意以下兩點、（一）第一須爲社會、我們中國公民過去最大的毛病、就是自自私自利、因私害公、所以我們今後要培養社會道德、最要緊的是要去除國民這種自私的劣根性、同時把我們中匣固有的修齊治平、孝悌忠信、禮義廉恥等社會道德、以及公民敎育原理、發揚光大起來、切實實行起來、我看中國的人心、實在已私到極點、甚至幹救國運動的人、也有喪心病狂的把救國捐欵呑入私囊、因救國運動發大財、靠救國運動造地位、人心私到這樣、民族有何法想、所以希望在座各位校長敎員、絶不要再讓學生自私、應該敎他們爲社會啟發他們社會的同心、據久居日本的朋友告訴我、日本人社會的同情心非常發展、（這當然祇是對他們自己如此）日本是多山的國家、常常有高低不平的山坡、苦力不能把東西推過去、過路的人、不管是何種人、甚至高貴的官吏、都會幫他推過去、這種互助的精神、隨處可以發見、不以爲奇、這是因爲他們一般人爲社會的同情心非常發展、所以絶不自私自利、絶不袖手旁觀、而有這普遍的偉大的互助合作、和衷共濟的精神、</p>
<p>（二）第二須守紀律　我們想團結民族的力量、一定要有社會的紀律、我們年年聽到團結起來、共赴國難的口號、可是現在我們這個民族還是四分五裂、没有能團結起來、實在令人慚愧、我們從社會學的眼光來看、社會的起源、社會的生存、一定要能團結、即在原始時代的圖騰社會裏、也早有了團給的精神、人民於一個圖記之下團結起來、共同勞動、共同奮鬥、精神很好、由於此種精神、才有現代社會的發展、所以社會構成的最重要的要素、就是團結、不團結就不能成爲社會、不團結的社會、就一定趨於崩潰、在這個社會學的定律上我們如果再不團結、我們的民族、就會歸於毁滅、而無法爭存、但是我們到底怎樣才能團結呢、那就要有社會的紀律、紀律是團結的初階、也是社會生命的要素、所以墨子因爲要兼愛、要救天下之亂、便主張「尙同」、墨子說、「古者民生未有政刑之時、一人則一義、二人則二義、十人則十義、其人滋衆、其所謂義者亦滋衆、是以人是其義、以非人之義、故交相非也、是以内者父子兄弟作怨惡、離散不能相和合、天下之百姓、皆以水火毒藥相虧害至有餘力不能以相勞、腐朽餘財、不能以相分、隱厯良道、不能以相敎、天下之亂、若禽獸焉」、中國現狀、正復如此、吾人欲救現狀之亂、一定要能「尙同」、尙同就是犧牲各人偏見、顧全國家大局、服從社會紀律、</p>
<p>（三）提倡自力主義　這是我的第三個老生常談、自力主義的動機和内容、講起來很長、至少要有五十萬言之多、其槪略我巳在國立上海醫學院講過、我發現這個主義的時間、是在去年除夕之夜、在守歲燭光之下、聲聲炮竹聲中、回顧前瞻、感慨萬千、就從我過去十年來所發表的言論中歸納出這一個原則、自力主義、作爲我今後自勉自勵的信條、自力主義的内容很複雜、現在限於時間、祇能講他的大意、自最簡單的說、力主義、就是一種以義務責任爲本位、以國家社會爲對象的全國動員努力自强的救國主義、至於這個主義的功用、就在去除一切中國民衆之病根、代以種種新的精神、例如中國民衆之病根是在空言、我的自力主義是要力行、中國民衆的病根是在虚驕、我的自力主義是要務實、中國民衆的病根是在取巧、我的自力主義是要刻苦、中國民衆的病根是在倖進、我的自力主義是要努务、中國民衆的病根是在責人、我的自力主義是要責己、中國民衆的病根是在依賴、我的自力主義是要求己、中國民衆的病根是在怠惰、我的自力主義是要勤奮、中國民衆的病根是在因循、我的自力主義是要進取、中國民衆的病根是在苟安、我的自力主義是要耐勞、中國民衆的病根是在卑怯、我的自力主義是要剛毅、中國民衆的病根是在爭權、我的自力主義是要盡責、中國民衆的病根是在自私、我的自力主義是要忠公、中國民衆的病根是在酣嬉、我的自力主義是要奮鬥、中國民衆的病根是在消費、我的自力主義是要生産、中國民衆的病根是在萎靡、我的自力主義是要堅忍、中國民衆病根是在畏難、我的自力主義是要勇敢、所以我的自力主義可說是對凖中國民衆的病根而發的一服良藥、中國公民之病態旣如此、而國難又十分嚴重、因此我們又可以說現在的時代、是自力主義的時代、而不上自由主義的時代、因爲自力主義是自强奮鬥的救國主義、所以他能發揚民族主義、而十八世紀的自由主義、他的流弊、巳産生了浪漫頽敗的個人主義、實在不適我國目前的需要、我提倡自力主義、就是爲要打倒這個浪漫頽敗的個人自由主義、來爭我們中華民族的生存、我們大家要覺悟、人生的意義、是一刻不懈的向上奮鬥、民族的生命、就是全國國民努力奮鬥的總績、天行健、君子自强不息、唯有我們全國國民繼續不斷的努力奮鬥、才能産生出中華民族綿延久遠的生命、從今以後、我國公民、果能本此自力主義的原則、努力自勉、則合全國四萬萬人民努力的結果、則我們民族力量的膨脹、一定可以驚動天地、所以我這個自力主義、尤爲吾國今後公民敎育者、所不能忽視的重要原則、</p>
<p>五·結論—民族復興的基本工作</p>
<p>我們民族復興的基本工作、首推敎育、敎育的目的、不外要訓練民衆、訓練民衆能有一種健全的智能與德性、並使他們以此種健全的智能與德性、去改善民族的地位、增加民族的力量、須知敎育的功用、乃是一個民族也可以說整個人類進化的動力、没有敎育、人類就没有進化、人類所以能進化到今日這樣文明、全是敎育之功、諸位都是在敎育界服務、希望認淸這個敎育的目的與功用、努力啟發這個民族生命開展的動力、來提高我們民族的地位、增加我們民族的力量、以完成我們敎育救國的使命、我們看德國被法國戰敗之後、他們救國唯一方法、就是斐希德所大聲疾呼的「敎育救國」的主張、後來不到二十幾年工夫、德國居然由此復興起來、這是敎育救國最好的例子、所以從國難發生以來、我便立志不唱高調、不欺驕民衆、主張敎育救國、我以爲民族病象、巳如此嚴重、高談闊論、非但無用、并且誤會、所以我們還是照十年生聚、十年敎訓這兩句老生常談去埋頭苦幹、努力敎訓我們的國民、使他們都有健全的智能與德性、來增加民族的力量、提高民族的地位、這才是民族復興的基礎工作根本辦法、歷史上、世界上、無論那個民族、他的强盛或復興、完全是他們全國民衆、長期的、一致的艱苦奮鬥、實際努力的結果、所以希望在座各位敎師、都能本此信念、負起這個責任、脚踏實地的、不避艱苦的、精誠無間的深入民間、去敎訓公民、以身作則的去領導公民、務使我國每一個公民、都能革除他的劣性、每一個公民、都能發生健全的力量、則區區老生常談、我相信一定能够挽救空前的國難、復興我們偉大的民族、</p>
<p>老生常談、卑無高論、千言萬語、姑止於此、希望各位坐言起行、這是我今天演講最大的希望、蔣家訓記、（完）</p>

<p>銀洋市况有進展形勢</p>
<p>近年銀洋市氣之呆滯、巳達極點、而上月中以現銀外溢、仍一度緊張、此乃特殊情形、不足爲例、時至今日、則銀洋市之形勢、確有正當之趨向、市塲中洋拆居然又越出一角以外、早午同做一角一分、較前日又緊一分際此舊習、中秋將屆、勢必尙有遞加之可能、而劃頭加水、初時做開四分、旋以頭寸充裕、改爲白劃、蓋洋用尙未屆需要時期、亦屬必然之勢耳、拆票交易、早市轉賬及新交易四百零幾萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖七十餘萬、新做一百五十餘萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵二百二十餘萬、電匯欵七十餘萬、外匯結欵八十餘萬、各種匯貨押墊什欵收解四百二十餘萬、進倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百十餘萬、外匯結欵一百三十餘萬、關稅欵六十餘萬、各種匯貨墊押什欵收解五百三十餘萬、進倉五十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百九十餘萬、外匯結欵七十餘萬、各種匯貨押墊什欵收解五百二十餘萬、出倉六十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千四百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解七百二十餘萬、鈔票收回九十餘萬、發出一百五十餘萬、各路匯欵五十餘萬、解現六十餘萬、客路來源三十萬、去胃十五萬、又本市票據交換所交換總數、銀元七百零一萬七千一百三十一元一角七分、内計銀元三百五十四萬八千四百四十四元零二分、匯劃銀元三百四十六萬八千六百八十七元一角五分、</p>

<p>證劵</p>
<p>債市混沌升降不一</p>
<p>昨華南證劵交易所、洋拆雖掛大一分、但與市面無關、市上檯面空頭、仍有壓迫形勢、大戶頗有掉期、聞大數押欵、仍屬困難、銀根尙未見鬆動、市上四號及五十四號等頗有買進、四十六號多頭掉期、廣帮亦有賣出、人心仍覺懷疑、市况因此頗有混沌之象、足見人心尙多忐忑不安、趨勢或將盤旋、昨日經過、開盤即見混沌、市况高低互見、相差約五分至四角不等、次盤前列略見回高一二角至四角半入後因五十號賣氣驟湧、故自廿二關起、反趨跌勢、小去一二角至半元左右、收盤又轉小面、前列一致回小二三角至半元左右、自廿二關起、反好二三角左右、趨勢恍惚、市上掉期交易爲多、散戶有相持之狀、綜計市價結果、計亦漲跌互見、頗爲紊亂、如整六漲四角半、廿關則尙跌去半元、高低不同、相差幾及一元、成交總數、計共二千零三十三萬一千元、</p>
<p>紐約股市一再下跌</p>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（十日）紐約股市、因華爾街人心悲觀而跌、投機家靜待梅恩州選舉之結果咸取觀望、合衆冶金慘落七元、蓋公司之盈利、不若一般想像之佳、使人失望、惟有謡言聲稱證劵交易所當局、正在調查該股之動作云、商業消息良好、開乃谷銅鑛續發股息一角五分、美國鋼鐡公司八月份之輸出增加三千噸、故市面之潛勢尙佳、因「馬魯砲台」輪船之沉没、致大西洋海灣西印度輪船公司猛跌四元、小交易所市况亦跌、在債市方面、美政府公債因財部宣布發行公債之計劃而略小、全日成交七十萬股、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<p>標紗反動回漲</p>
<p>市盤巳低引起多頭興趣</p>
<p>連跌兩日之紗市、今則突然反動趨漲、因南埠採現活動、同時原棉回漲、且有王某投機者視標紗比高價時巳跌去十餘元、對於多頭稍有興趣、購進有數千包、於是人心激起、市盤轉漲、但外棉狀况、平澹之局耳、</p>
<p>金鷄回好八九角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以美棉趨跌、印棉跌風益熾、但塲中市勢並不十分虚弱、因上日現紗銷塲良好、至多頭心意安靜、各月均漲一·四·五·七角、午後聞現紗銷路仍有一千八九百包、前市且有大戶購買、市氣尤帶緊俏、各月又漲四·五·六·七角、全日成交統計三萬二千四百包、查賣出大孚七百五十包、昶記四百包、益昶七百包、恊成八百包、大昶九百五十包、恊生一千零五十包、源大七百包、愼裕五百五十包、買進大豐一千零五十包、穗隆四百五十包、吉豐六百五十包、愼昌一千四百包、長豐一千二百包、潤康一千二百包、遠大五百五十包、長餘五百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>棉市突轉高昂</p>
<p>棉市趨堅、美印棉市雖一致傾向下游、然本埠有某棉公司乘跌時、大量的購買、且包額巳有二三萬擔、致檯面乾枯、市勢突然轉緊、惟碼頭上通姚花開盤趨跌、各廠現棉交易、仍未見暢、</p>
<p>鄭標多頭大量加碼</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、印棉跌勢雖烈、然塲中有某棉公司、大量的不限價購進、檯面帶緊、市盤又漲一角半至二角、午後市况仍挺、買者較多、各月又漲一·二角、但現棉開價平平、全日成交統計七萬九千五百擔、查賣出永昌一千五百擔、大孚一千四百擔、大豐三千九百擔、穗隆一千二百擔、惠康二千擔、森康一千五百擔、益昶二千七百擔、鴻昌二千一百擔、源大一千七百擔、同和一千四百擔、買進吉豐一千二百擔、愼昌四千二百擔、潤康四千一百擔、長和五千擔、大豐二千擔、愼記一千擔、恒昌二千擔、均昶一千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>姚花三０五０　利泰廠進　一、０００包　現貨棧交</p>
<p>美棉回跌二十磅音</p>
<p>昨日美棉因政府報告利於空頭、布市淸淡、及華爾街不振、市况疲軟、結果現貨跌二十磅音、期貨跌二十至二十二磅音、英棉期貨跌十四五點、印棉初因大批多頭了結、及投機家賣出而跌、後因歐洲出口商略有買進而回、結果平果爾跌</p>

<p>糧食</p>
<p>期粉麥一致軟落</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈一致軟弱之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回小一角半左右不等、當開盤後、因實銷平淡、業内外心思、均見疲滯不振、一部分大戶浮多、紛紛了結、故開價即較前日跌二三分、本月份在二三盤時、曾一度小至二元三角五分二厘半、遠期各月份、則巳呈盤旋、至收盤則空頭抵補、略見好面、迨至下午開盤、初仍平平、旋因廠方籌碼、略有補回、業外之空戶、亦見稀淡、故二盤以下、各月份開價、即覺安穩、較上午最低時、回振一二分不等、結果本月份較前日小七厘半、十月份小五厘、十一月份小一分、十二月份小七厘半、一月份小一分七厘半、二月份小一分半、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、呼月份市面、均見疲落無神之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、均回小一角零、故開盤時、人心均呈寂寞、買戶異常少興、因粉銷淸淡以來、小麥需要、當然减少、更以米市鬆動、内地人心、亦不若從前之緊迫、有實貨之客戶、一部分巳套賣標凖、因此多頭方面、遭受打擊、市面遂覺振動爲難、各月份之差度、較前日計跌三五六分不等、迨至下午開盤、因粉市見定、多頭回出見稀、一部分空頭、反買多頭、市面遂見稍佳、結果本月份較跌四分、十月份小二分、十一十二月份不動、一月份小四分、現麥市面、巳有生動、價則平穩、開山東徐州臨淮關麥三元六角、計一萬包、由福新辦去、</p>
<p>破粳再跌一二角</p>
<p>（滬南）　昨日各帮來源與前相仿、仍爲二十號左右、貨共三千餘石、銷塲呆滯、客帮包胃雖動、然爲數無幾、祇百數十包、疲頽市况、猶復難挽、故若各厚粳及晚稻行情再跌一二角、惟新粳新尖等貨、以天時轉變陰　、人心稍定、市色獨能轉定、其外各花色大都未見做開、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十餘號、市上各貨去胃淸淡、市價白粳高波一角、中次小二角外、新羊尖杜尖小三四角、薄稻白元小一角左右、陳羊杜客尖小一角許、西新粳亦見修短、東新粳定勢、</p>
<p>洋客秈銷路仍呆</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、本街略有應酬、惟客帮胃口甚呆、市面似有趨落之象、洋米除巳經到埠外、今明尙有續到、故晨間洋米開價巳軟、十一月份五元零二分、又比前市跌小三分、繼因新到洋米均須應解抛出路貨、市上並無浮存求售、而九江帮績有期貨吸收、十一月份西貢又開至五元零五分矣、現洋米等均形平站全市開出期貨五百噸、現洋米八百五十包、機糙各米一千五百包、現米除台州辦去沙市砶米一百五十四包外、均由本街辦去云、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<p>潮靑開價稍鬆</p>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金微堅、趨勢平定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨普通十九元六角半、轉口貨六元五角半、比前日好起五分、荷赤則反見鬆、現貨十四元三角至二角、比前日小去五分、轉口貨呌五元四角、未成、本廠绵白、振記一號十八元六角半、小去五分、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元九角半、ＣＷ嘜十九元六角半、香港原來冰花靑、由潮帮開出一百包、價爲十五元九角半、比前略跌、潮靑略見活動、昨開出二百數十包、黄崗靑價爲十三元四五角、隆港靑十二元七角半、比前鬆去角許、</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<p>新同安圓續有開出</p>
<p>同安桂圓登新以來、近日到貨漸增、銷路亦尙可觀、供求差堪相抵、昨市第三批亦巳開出、總計千箱之譜、貨品純正者價與前無甚上落、惟粒子參差者退一二元至數角不等、趨勢平定、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<p>華絲外銷絶望</p>

<h3 id="c17">不景氣 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 孔公</p>
<p>空公論氣，還有一種氣未加進去，那是「不景氣」。</p>
<p>斯「氣」也，縉紳先生多能方之。無論問一大商人或小商人，大闊人或小闊人，大要人或小要人，他往往說，「近來商業之不景氣，加以農村經濟破産……」云云，便可以懂到許多，如果是商量經濟方面的事情，也隨卽可以悟到他所說的。</p>
<p>這句話流入中國，約遠在民國十七年，其盛行是在近三年，說不定還要流傳下去。其源出於日本。和「駄日迭士」同是一個娘家。</p>
<p>何以盛行於近三年呢？因爲前有水災，後有旱災，并要人偉人所流連的西湖，也乾成了一個硯台似的了。中間還有兵禍，溥儀出關，上海打仗，都是使這話流傳的原因。</p>
<p>而中文之廣博，豐富，竟没有一個名詞能够形容這境况麽？有的，如「蒼生破碎」，「民生凋敝」，「一路蕭條」，「生意淸淡」，更文雅的有：「民不聊生」，「民卒流亡」，「率獸食人」，「下民昏墊」……或更直率說：「百姓没有飯吃」。然而這些名詞大抵是官樣文章，用成濫調了，或又嫌其慘淡，說者聽者都戚然變容。旣達意而又時新，又不過火，還是這三字：不景氣。</p>
<p>挨打一次當然忿怒，二次三次後，忿怒减少了，增加了冷嘲，失却自信力，倒有時自覺滑稽起來，懷疑起來，及至習於挨打，這時「知其當然」，要心平氣和了。人類大率是服從習慣的動物，因此也更可悲。例如這「不景氣」三字，是很有些滑稽和無告之意的，也鄙夷，也幽默，也告乏，也習成自然。這情况要站在歷史上或意像的另外一種人的境地里，方可分明看出，一時代的人的情感是什麽樣子。</p>
<h3 id="c18">北平的渴慕者 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>是秋天了。</p>
<p>黄昏，滿天天浮動着灰色的雲朶；一層緊壓着一層地，偶然抬起頭來，瞧見這蒼茫的暮色很有一點悲愴之感湧上心。由於什麽緣故自家也難分析出來：大槪是因爲巳是秋天了，一刹那間便有嚴寒的日子要來到的。生長於熱帶的地方的我，不用說，對於颯颯的北風是没有好感：就是白皚皚的雪吧，兩年來我也不曾寫過一篇賞雪的文章，向人說過一句喜歡雪的話。</p>
<p>可是今年有點變異了。</p>
<p>浴在一百度以上的熱度裏在今年的夏季可說是太常有的事了。整天倘着汗水，人是疲倦的，不能讀書也不能做事，——這苦處，使我不知咀咒了多少次夏這季節：同時，郤悄悄地希望秋風快點吹上身來，甚至在人的面前承認冬天的好處了。</p>
<p>「這是第一次呢，聽你對冬天表示好感。」</p>
<p>玲玲，那愛嘮叨的女人，笑嘻嘻地向我這樣說。我不知道她是用着怎樣的態度對我說這話，一時只望了望她没有回答。</p>
<p>「想到北平去嗎？」</p>
<p>「北平？」</p>
<p>「是啊！我說你想不想到北平去？」</p>
<p>覺得玲玲的話來得過於突兀，我莫明其妙地在她的面前閉着嘴，她却立卽發現了今天的我忽然遲鈍下來，很不以爲地又申明着：</p>
<p>「我凖備到北平去了。」</p>
<p>接着便告訴我北平有個喜歡她的男人可以招待她：在那裏，她也打算喜歡一下那個將近中年的人。……</p>
<p>「可是，你却問我——」</p>
<p>「你如果要去，一同去不是很好麽？」</p>
<p>「呃——」</p>
<p>和玲玲一同去是不行的。我也喜歡歡玲玲呢，我能够讓她往那個男人的家裏去嗎？所以，我是搖着頭拒絶了，只在一個禮拜之後，火車站前稍稍有點秋意的夜裏送她上了車，便獨自個回轉來。</p>
<p>……現在秋意一天深似一天了，，玲玲早巳到了北平罷。因爲北平有着那愛嘮叨的女人，我開始對着牠表示我的渴慕。當着冬天的短促的日子，踏着雪地，讓尖利的北風剌上身來；儘管要走的路是多麽是吧，我也是一樣地富有朝氣的呵！我會帶着異樣的心情來聽暗夜裏叮叮響着的風鈴，我會耐心地數着外邊迂緩的，沉重的駱駝的脚步。——北平是那麽值得我頌讚的呢！不是麽，玲玲巳經生活在那裏了。</p>
<p>可是那一天天我可以到北平去呢？</p>

<p>— 奥立莎作宜閑譯</p>
<p>奥立莎（u·olesha）是蘇聯有名的戲劇作家和小說家。寫過「成績表」「感情的計劃」「一個胖子」這幾篇劇本，在莫斯科各大戲院開演，都有相當的成功。他在這篇隨筆裏，就他寫作一篇劇本時構思的過程，作着示例的記述。凡有凖備寫作劇本的人們從這裏多少可以學習到一些技巧的。—譯者記</p>
<p>瑪莎。</p>
<p>年紀：廿三歲。</p>
<p>她的丈夫。留着小鬍子。工作得很疲倦了——至少，他自己說很疲倦了。</p>
<p>那丈夫的名字呌鮑爾立斯·密克海洛維支——鮑爾耶。</p>
<p>他喜歡捉弄别人。敎人家落到不舒服的地步，是他再開心不過的事。</p>
<p>他一成就了這樣的舉動，就笑得連眼淚都出來。笑過了，他拿下了夾鼻眼鏡，揩一揩兩眼。</p>
<p>他穿的就算是一雙長統靴罷。</p>
<p>小鬍子，夾鼻眼鏡，長統靴。</p>
<p>工作後回到家裏，他第一句問話是關於夜飯的。「咳！夜飯怎樣了？」</p>
<p>食器架一口。整潔的。他走到屏風後面洗手。當他在屏風後面的時候，他參加着舞台上的人們的會話。</p>
<p>舞台上是瑪莎的父親和葛芬克爾醫生。葛芬克爾醫生是鄰居。</p>
<p>登塲人物：三個</p>
<p>丈夫</p>
<p>父親</p>
<p>葛芬克爾醫生</p>
<p>那丈夫從屏風後面出來，還揩着兩手。</p>
<p>瑪莎的父親是老頭子。顚頭播腦的。好像灰色的山羊。會做菜。說着：「我有烹調的本領。」</p>
<p>一個人的動作上顯現着他的性格——這是明明白白的。但是性格却也從一個人對於事物的關係上顯現出來。在這劇本裏，我想表現出每人對於各種東西的看法來，把登塲人物的性格展開。譬如，就電車來說罷。我想像着呌作丈夫的這人物是利己主義者，是有些有産者的本能，骨子裏成見很深的氣量狹小的人。便是在他出演之前，我也想敎讀者明白他是怎樣的一種人。</p>
<p>丈夫（從屏風後面出來：「今天我等電車——咳！足足四十分鐘總有的！」</p>
<p>父親：「糟透了！」</p>
<p>丈夫（向醫生）：「咳，你事情怎樣，阿勃拉謨，密朗尼支」？</p>
<p>這句問話是順口說出，並不想望有什麽回答的。葛芬克爾的事情怎樣，在那丈夫是一點興味也没有的。他只有對於自己的事情，纔有着興味。</p>
<p>醫生：「很好，謝謝你。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「你可知道我有怎麽一種意外的發現？」</p>
<p>他覺得意外的是什麽呢？</p>
<p>「今天我在電車上想著——從前面上來的是怎樣的一羣人呢！我來點點看。第一是帶領着小孩子的那些女人。對不對？接着是莫斯科蘇維埃的人員。」</p>
<p>父親：「還有殘廢兵。」</p>
<p>丈夫：「一點不錯，殘廢兵。你看，帶領着孩子的女人，莫斯科蘇維埃的人員，殘廢兵……還有瞎子，打過仗的老兵。還有大約是電車工人罷？還有義勇軍？還有各種陌生人……猜不出他們是怎樣的人！」</p>
<p>葛芬克爾於是把這番關於電車的談話打斷了。這個人物性格上正和那丈夫相反。因此他得用完全不同的口氣來談到電車。</p>
<p>醫生：「我在電車站等車子的時候，我等着的車子總是再也不會來似的。譬如今天罷，我等着車子。自然呵，十七路没有來，……我儘管等着。一部車子也不見了……隨後車子來了，空空的，一連三部，可是十七路却没有。我自然不由地想，全羣的人都等着十七路。如果我起頭來等别路車子罷，那一路也會不來的，而且全羣的人也就起頭來等那一路了。我眞是妨碍市上交通的魔王。」</p>
<p>這樣，便是在戲劇開始以前，我們也能够使聽衆想到我們探討着的是怎麽幾種性格了。那醫生有着幽默能够嘲笑自己（這是理智的徵象）而且，自然也有一些詩人的風度。那丈夫是拙笨的，存心不良的，給淺聘的野心腐蝕了靈魂的人。</p>
<p>那醫生出去了，那丈夫馬上轉過背來，說道：</p>
<p>「……我們的醫生眞是十分那個呀——你知道怎麽罷。」</p>
<p>六點一刻。</p>
<p>瑪莎就要從工作的地方回家來。</p>
<p>這是第一幕開塲的情形。</p>
<p>他們有的是怎麽一種傢具呢？</p>
<p>有幾塊隔板的一口食器架。黑黑的，有着彫刻的旋形花紋的底脚。</p>
<p>一張有套子的長沙發。</p>
<p>屋子中央一張食桌。</p>
<p>一把靠手椅。這是吃飯間。那父親睡在這里的長沙發上。面盆架在屏風後面。</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>那丈夫不耐煩地等着夜飯。</p>
<p>關於醫生的一番談話開頭了。</p>
<p>「如果他是好醫生，他就掛牌了，可是他……他却在戲院事做事，」那父親說。</p>
<p>那父親講的只是一般人講過的費話。有一種人是除了費話，没有什麽意見的。譬如說：</p>
<p>「醫藥是不大可以相信的。只有外科手術纔可以相信。」</p>
<p>一句費話。他聽到過這一種在什麽地方表現過的意見。現在他就把這個意見重說了一遍，還以爲是他自推定的結論。這種人物可以刻畫到使他變得古怪的。舉個例子罷，我們可以敎他講這樣的話：</p>
<p>「我有一件魚皮哩，我是這麽呌着這件衣服的。」</p>
<p>或者說：</p>
<p>「在這種事情上，我說啦—與其做不成，還是慢慢兒做着。」</p>
<p>他相信着只有自己纔說這種話。</p>
<p>葛芬克爾呌他「費話先生。」</p>
<p>費話先生是滿意於他的生活，他自己以及他對於世界的關係的。在他看來，什麽事情都是明明白白而且容易懂得的。</p>
<p>葛芬克爾做着一家戲院的專任醫生。可以說是一個「舞台醫生。」</p>
<p>姿態上他好像惠爾狄。（Ｖerdi意大利的著名歌劇作家—譯者註）</p>
<p>五十六歲。</p>
<p>一雙亮閃閃的奕奕有神的眼睛。</p>
<p>亂蓬蓬的頭髮。灰白的鬍子—有一邊濃密些兒。敏活的舉動。他頭向後仰。</p>
<p>阿勃拉謨·密朗諾維支·葛芬克爾。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c20">他買一隻鞋子（中） <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>「八角錢一對還不行麽？……好，我該給你的四角半——我買一隻。」那兵士說了，右手便向口袋裏摸着。</p>
<p>「吓！」店夥敏捷地轉過身來，鄙夷而厭惡地說，「老兄，生意我們是做的。可是我們從來没有賣過一隻鞋子。」做夢似地他隨意添上一句說：「反正是值得幾角錢的東西哩。」他像陪笑地嘻了兩聲，冷冷地走開了。</p>
<p>兵士緩慢地抬眼望他一望，没做響。從袋裏拿出兩只雙角子，躊躇地數着銅板。最後，他扳開紙盒子，把多餘的一隻鞋摔到椅子上，自己需要的那隻裝到盒子裏。</p>
<p>「喂，半角錢是十五個銅板麽？」他瞧不見那伙計，便暴躁地大聲喊。</p>
<p>老板身上像裝了彈簧，不住地打躬送走了那班偷了糖吃的蒼蠅般嗡嗡地笑的女學生，轉過身來對像要撒野的兵士佈施着一個較冷靜的微笑。</p>
<p>「呀，你要些什麽，先生？」</p>
<p>「我買一隻鞋子。」兵士没有打算他底請求有被拒絶的可能，放心地數他底銅板。「半角錢該幾個銅板？」</p>
<p>老板在幾次勸告失敗之後，受了委屈似地，突然憤怒得跳起來：「哼，我們是不替獨脚的人造鞋子的，你替我打算一下吧，要是個個人像你，我們做生意的不是要虧本了麽？我們到那兒去找跛右脚的主顧？」</p>
<p>「但是誰呌我弄掉一條腿的呢？對了，要是個個中國人像我們，那末東洋人不會坐在東三省享福了……」他用低沉的喉音說了，拿紙盒子夾在右腋下，挾住木脚站起來，想向門外去。另外的一個胖胖的伙計手急眼快地跳上一步按住了他。</p>
<p>那超出了謙恭跟和平底範圍外的呌駡聲，引動了許多好事的人，閒着的黄包車伕，其中還夾雜一些膽子大一點的女人：他們切斷了這條繁盛道路底交通。</p>
<p>「打呀，打呀！擾亂商塲的傢伙，搶刦的强盜；我們賺的錢不够捐給你們這班没用的東西。吓，管他什麽人都好，只要用不着我們納這許多捐就好了……」老板像前綫臨陣的長官，瘋狂地對他底手下煽動着，並且要向誰獲得同情似地。可是大家都没有動手之前，圍住「履亨」店前的人堆裏有誰這樣不平地嘶呌了。</p>
<p>「是呀，比謀害一只脫螯的蟹更容易嗄！」</p>
<p>「打我？我没有碰見過兇漢！東洋鬼底坦克車我當牠是山蟻哩。你是什麽？一個吸血的葫蘆！」他並不十分動氣地駡着，一面用木脚招架敵人底拳頭。</p>

<h3 id="c21">上海的偉大 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 王壬</p>
<p>號稱東方最高的建築，那轟立在靜安寺路的國際大飯店要是落成，有誰爬上它的最高峯俯視上海，無疑，在一望無垠，和蜂房一樣底許多住宅當中，是只有橫七直八，比長白練布條還小的許多馬路，跳躍着一支支和蹚螂一樣的電車，靑蛙似的汽車，和着那好像不前也不退，慢踱着同螞蟻似的行人，這便是上海的偉大。</p>
<p>不錯，上海是偉大的。這裏，除電車汽車，每天自朝至晚，在把整個的上海震撼着，而且大工廠裏的煤灰，和着汽笛的吼呌，也都將偉大的上海，每天包圍在一種不寗靜的狀態當中。</p>
<p>而且，除這些目所見，耳所聞，一切跳躍，呌囂的東西，充分表現着上海，在現今的世界是如何一個地方。中間却還暗藏着無數的事物，是在二十四層高新建的國際大飯店，一時也不能看出的東西。這便是每天新聞紙上，所不斷産生的各種不同的社會花樣。</p>
<p>若要我進一步把牠仔細點分别起來，倒也不見繁難。列表如下：</p>
<p>關於盜竊的，屬於「財」的方面；</p>
<p>路刦（每天至少三起）</p>
<p>小竊（每天至少十起）</p>
<p>劇盜（每天至少三起）</p>
<p>關於欺蒙的，也屬「財」的方面，但條件比較不是單純。</p>
<p>拐騙（每天至少五起）</p>
<p>欺詐（每天至少五起）</p>
<p>關於姦誘的，屬於：色的方面；</p>
<p>略誘（每天至少十起）</p>
<p>强姦（每天至少五起）</p>
<p>關於鬥殺的，屬於「氣」的方面；</p>
<p>鬥毆（每天至少五起）</p>
<p>仇殺（每天至少三起）</p>
<p>關於死亡的，包括「財色氣」三者，這便所謂：人生，所謂「生活」。</p>
<p>服毒（每天至少三起）</p>
<p>投河（每天至少一起）</p>
<p>倒斃（每天至少一起）夏冬兩季照例增加。老死，病死不在此例。</p>
<p>其他紅丸，嗎啡，流氓，拆梢，乞丐之流，則不必一一舉出，卽就上面幾行字數的橫單，便是洋洋大觀，足可代表上海的偉大（？）至於我那表上「至少」的數目，有些是不經報紙登出的。而且就找到上海幾個法院裏頭，有時也不能證明眞確。但上海偉大是眞的。這兒十里洋塲，雖則不少治安機關，而且可謂警捕林立，但大街小巷，遺漏的瑣屑社會新聞，不經宣揚出來，成了永遠的隱秘罪惡，誰就敢說决對没有呢？</p>
<p>不錯，上海是偉大的，偉大的上海，必須有這樣偉大的事蹟。我上面所舉的那些，不都是偉大（？）的事蹟麽？如果上海而没有了上面各種偉大的事蹟，則上海之不會平凡也幾希。惟冀上海之永遠成其偉大，我多多的祝賀着上海，能産生上面那各種不平凡的事蹟。</p>
<h3 id="c22">一九三四月光曲 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>（街上：秋季大减價，自一五折至九折；中秋月餅上市；新到秋季最靡登衣料；坐上海市輪渡看月亮去，</p>
<p>看月亮去！</p>
<p>人：怱忙的，悠閒的，仇恨的。）</p>
<p>没有米，巳是尋常的事啦；可是從昨天起連掘得的半袋山芋都吃完了，早上　　　　　　到　上　十　　未借　，「老二窮死到底還有一爿小店，終究比自己好點兒。」</p>
<p>可是，回來的時候，好遠便瞧見阿虎手裏的袋子：該死！是空的，阿虎把它團成一團握在手裏揩汗。</p>
<p>心像有人在拉似的突然往下一沉：落空啦，得挨一天餓啦！」</p>
<p>可是阿虎那小夥子，帶着少年的懷疑，走近來便說：「米借不到，城裏的　食　都　　　。」</p>
<p>一下子阿三爹可耐不住啦，「死東西，你逛街嗎！二伯怎麽說？」</p>
<p>「說自己也一樣的没米吃哩，米貴了便不買了，也是吃蕃芋，店裏生意不好。」</p>
<p>阿三爹過了年便看得見六十了，這「近花甲」的年紀正是他自己認爲最值得誇耀的；可是現在他有點懷疑：這年份是誰都不曾瞧見的；種田，收租，做買賣，做工，什麽都弄不好，什麽人都弄不下去。「天下大亂的故事在小的時候是聽見人講過的，可是阿三爹始終有一件事弄不懂。弄不懂的是：世界亂，人人都不好，那末好了那一個呢？</p>
<p>這「好了那一個」，便是他底最大的懷疑，有人吃虧，就一定有人佔便宜的。大家都吃着虧的時候，這佔便宜的是那一個呢？</p>
<p>說佔便宜的是村頭的王老爺那一類人吧，以前他和阿虎都有點相信的；然而現在也靠不住了。王老爺是靠了三百多畝田「坐吃」的人，今年一下子旱荒，三百多畝田裏盡塞滿了乾的和爛的稻桿。不是那天他家的當差的老張說過的嗎？他也有他的苦，一年的開銷全靠田裏來的，今年一個子都撈不到，捐呀稅呀倒不是不能短少的。聽說大兒子在上海大學堂裏唸書的，今年也唸不起了。全家想搬到上海去。</p>
<p>這麽着，像王老爺那種人也不是佔便宜的。</p>
<p>抬起頭，又看見拿着空袋在看也發呆的阿虎：「死狗，没有東西吃咧，知道嗎？」</p>
<p>猛地想起，今天是陰歷八月十三啦，節邊老二那爿雜貨店裏「定有一點生意，阿虎是小孩子，自己再去走一趟。</p>
<p>像希望便在手邊似的，三阿爹披上一件短布衫，便興怱怱的踏着龜裂的田土望街上走。</p>
<p>可是：奇跡哪！八月十三，自己雖然糊塗，這一點總不會錯。街上的店舖門口不是也貼起紅紅綠綠的紙條來了嗎？然而怎麽會那麽冷落呢？别說買，連看的人，擠熱鬧的人都很少呀。怎麽呢？怎麽呢？</p>
<p>走到老二的那　一間頭的寫着「京廣雜貨的舖子門前，便聽見老二的大喉嚨，走着進去，老二的臉是漲得通紅的，一抬頭，便看見了阿三爹：</p>
<p>「老三，你來得好，你想想看，事情好不好做，今年鄉下收成一點也没有，市面那樣壞，是大家都看見的，幾個老賬戶還要那樣的來逼，一家緊家家緊，節上市面那樣不好，不是我們一處，你看他們幾位連十幾塊的帳都不肯放鬆。好好，我的東西全在這兒，隨你們怎樣辦，這年頭眞不是路。中秋節我們還挨餓啦，老三，我什麽都不要了，我們當强盜去！」</p>
<p>這才怪啦！三　第一次在他底哥哥臉上看見了很眼淚。</p>

<p>旣有科學靈乩於前，復有科學算命於後，大家都是迷信，弄堂裏打打醮，自然烏可非議。</p>
<p>而且黑雲沙朋友雖以鬼欺人，倒底喊班和尙道士來吹吹打打與鬼同樂。大家樂助幾毛錢，譬如納凉時聽瞎姑娘的唱十八摸。</p>
<p>再一個而且，如今的鬼也摩登起來，那班和尙道士忘了自家吃飯藝術，不唸南無道理，却是可憐的秋香，特别快車的亂唱亂跳一泡，在大善士等則省得立在洋貨店門口仰起頭來聽得脚酸腰塌</p>
<p>其實秋香快車之深入佛鬼界，其理至明，皇后娘娘一聲搖搖寳寳，搖得人心惶惶。生爲中國人，死自然是中國鬼，人同此心，鬼亦同此理，巧玲瓏橱窗内的紙紥無綫電，倒並不是投機取巧。</p>

<p>他歪斜着脚步從酒館裏出來。</p>
<p>月亮掛在天空，上差巡捕無聊耐的在人家烟兌店門口打混，騷動的都市巳恢復了安靜的狀態。他挺一胸脯，吸足滿肺氣，覺得今天是再舒適没有了。洒開大步，直往家中走去，但是意識巳被酒精主宰着，一切都不能如他的意想，踏着月光，不知不覺地他走到黄浦灘邊，迎面一個白俄伸出手來向他乞錢，等到他兩手插進袋裏的時候，他明白自己和那白俄一般的貧窮了，酒力也淸醒了一半，他想起家中有病着的妻子，再掄起眼晴沉思自己今天的經過。</p>
<p>妻巳經病了許多時候，請過許多醫生，都說不過延長些日子罷了。但是這個消息被妻聽得了，於是每天在床上大吵小鬧，駡他没有良心，一定外面有了野女人，只碍着她一個人，有時半夜裏無緣無故的大哭起來，擾得他不能安睡，而第二天又要很早起來到工廠去，其實他聽了醫生的話，心中着實很憂悶，自己一個光蛋到上海來，勤儉起家，娶了這女人。不要說外面胡混，就是結婚张二年他從没有回家遲一點半點鐘。現在爲了妻子的病，他除了工作之外，更是不離病床，並且許多辛苦積蓄起來的錢，都爲了妻子的病化光了，還拖了工廠裏一個月的工資。他天天希望妻子的病好起來，現在他工作都不能安心了。在廠裏的十小時中，他每一秒鐘都想着妻子，聽見汽笛放工，他就没命的家裏奔，見了妻子好好地睡在床上才安了心。但是妻子却没頭没腦說出那些野話來，他起初以爲病人心中不舒服，也隨她去亂說，靜靜地坐在旁邊休息一回。妻子却以爲他是虚心了，更拍床拍桌大駡起來，好像他外面巳娶了女人，只等她死。又爲了這兩天没有錢請醫生，女人就抓了這話柄說他不存好心，什麽難聽的話都說了出來。有時他實在疲乏了，趟着不理她，女子還是不放過他，亂呌亂喊。</p>
<p>這天星期，廠裏有半天假，他也不回家，逕自到朋友宿舍裏胡混了半天，獨自到小酒館裏喝酒。他本來没有多大的酒量，但是今天他喝了兩個多鐘頭，把袋裏的一塊錢都化光了，才拍着身子彷彿完了一件重大的工務似的踱了出來</p>
<p>現在他酒醒了，那妻子拍床拍桌的情形自然很明晰的浮上心眼來，他無論如何不願意回家。對那白俄拍拍袋子，表示自己巳没有錢，就無目的向前走了</p>
<p>第二天他也没有回家，廠裏同時不是他上工，他就此失蹤了，誰都不知道</p>
<h3 id="c26">雨的黃昏 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 珍</p>
<p>在這兩的黄昏，無聊苦悶佔住着心頭，感到寂寞。</p>
<p>自己老是這矛盾的心理，老愛追憶着過去。但追憶過去中，又明明地被現實抓住了，這不能忍耐的現實的痛苦，不幸又深深地噬着我的心。</p>
<p>窗外的雨點，像豆般大，打到玻璃窗和竹簾上，發着淅瀝的聲響。天空漆一般黑。有時閃出縷縷的金光。間有隆隆的雷響。</p>
<p>寂寞，空虚。一個心兒壓縮得緊緊地收縮起來。靑春的花朶是早粉碎在歲月的輪軸下，什麽是希望，什麽是幸福，不過是些斫削人的血肉的利箭，金繡的華幕在這中間殘坍，鮮麗的春花在這中間凋零。在命運之魔底掌握中轉輾着的弱的人生。</p>
<p>不差亦有人告訴我這是個弱肉强食的世界。是一個力量的世界。更有人告訴我光是幻想，悲哀有什麽用呢？環境是人爲的。在無畏者的面前才有路。最後的勝利只有健實的奮鬥，然而這一切有什麽安慰呢？奮鬥！掙扎！自己的結果是關在斗室裏聽着風嘯雨哭。任苦悶寂寞來煎熬。我的同戰綫的伙伴呢？掙扎盡他們最後的一滴血，一滴汗。餓死的餓死了，暴卒的暴卒了，一堆血和黄土。就是他們畢生奮鬥的歸宿。</p>
<p>唉，這一切有什麽安慰呢？雨仍大。昏沉的腦子愈覺昏沉。寂寞，苦悶，在這雨後的黄昏，不會比飢餓滅亡好受。我願意打開死神的地獄門。救出我的伙伴，再投身進去好把我囚住。</p>
<p>雨仍大。傾盆的在下。下。昏沉的腦子愈覺昏沉。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>這時候時敏也揷嘴說：</p>
<p>「爸爸，你看，這一隻也是有的。」</p>
<p>旭齋看看，果然不錯，所以他也笑笑的說：</p>
<p>「哼，這不是什麽脚，每隻鷄都是有的。」</p>
<p>「哎，你們眞是奇怪，」鳳雲叔似乎有一點兒惱了；「這種小的肉痣是每一隻雞都有，可是這種大的却是脚呀，爲什麽不相信呢？」</p>
<p>然而姑媽也有理由，她也堅持着說：</p>
<p>「那末這不過是有的大些有的小些罷了，爲什麽大的就一定是脚呢？那末小的又是什麽？」</p>
<p>「那你不相信也是没有辦法的事。反正這又不是我一個人說的，村裏那一家不殺幾隻雞？有的人家差不多殺得一隻不留。」</p>
<p>看上去，鳳雲叔巳經很生氣了。其後還是旭齋出主意；他以爲鳳雲的話，固然靠不住，不過就是殺幾隻鷄也算不了什麽，於是他對姑媽說：</p>
<p>「不管是眞是假，你就把那幾隻肉痣長得很長的殺了牠罷，反正殺了雞也有得吃的。」</p>
<p>一說到殺雞吃，自然時敏是滿高興的。本來雞肉的好吃與否，在他到没有什麽，不過那雞腦裏的秦檜，假使咬出來的時候一點也不弄破的話，那反縛着手跪着的模樣兒，確是怪有趣的。</p>
<p>一想到這裏，時敏高興得什麽似的，便跑到廚房裏去拿了刀來，鳳雲叔看得發笑，摩着他的頭頂說：</p>
<p>「這你應當謝謝我了，不然你那兒會有雞吃呢？」</p>
<p>「哼，讀書不用功，說到殺雞就來了。好吃懶做，眞是没有用的東西。」</p>
<p>時敏聽到父親這樣說了，到有點不好意思起來，所以扯着姑媽的衣角，拉她到廚房裏去了。這時候鳳雲叔也預備走了，當他背起小糞箕走出大門的時候，他聽着廚房裏有雞呌的聲音，好像也很可憐似的。旭齋照例的將客人送到門口便回來。一陣秋風從樹葉間掠過他的肩頭，似乎有一點凉擻擻的，使他不禁打了一個寒噤。</p>
<p>他走回來躺在廊前的竹靠椅上。那椅子從前天起巳經墊了一幅絨氈，睡上去到很舒服。不過就從這氈子上面又使他想起一段故事來。這還是戊辰年，今年辛亥，算起來，巳經是四年了。他因爲科學巳廢，自己考取了秀才之後，姑終没有一次到省城進貢院的機會。於是他便以廩生的資格考取了法政學堂。到去年，他在法政學堂畢了業，又花了差不多一百元的本洋，到現在總算在祠堂内掛了一塊藍底金字的直匾，上面寫着「欽賜法政學堂出身八品銜」了，而左側的小字便是「臣史曦」。這一幅氈子便是那年晉省考法政學堂時買的。其後騎馬拜客，在用人手上又挾出挾進了好幾天。說起來，這一條絨氈到也有一番光榮歷史的。可是現在想起來，好像是做夢似的有點隔世之感，然而那種滋味到還是不壞的啦。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Announcement to the Current League of Nations Assembly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Ting</p>
<p>As the League of Nations Assembly is about to re-elect non-permanent members of the Administrative Council, we sincerely appeal to the representatives of friendly nations attending the Assembly. Our country has reason to seek re-election.</p>
<p>(1) China was one of the first nations to join the League of Nations and has been one of the most enthusiastic supporters. Speaking of population, it accounts for one-fourth of the world's total. Speaking of territory, it accounts for one-fourth of Asia's area. Speaking of civilization, it spans five thousand years and extends over tens of thousands of miles, and is respected by all nations of the world. Having even one of these merits is enough to stand on equal footing with the advanced countries of the world. Even demanding a seat as a permanent member of the League of Nations Administrative Council would not be presumptuous. If we are denied even a non-permanent seat, the Chinese government and people will undoubtedly feel deeply disappointed, we can state firmly.</p>
<p>(2) Since the September 18th Incident, China, trusting in the League of Nations, did not immediately resort to active resistance. However, the League of Nations was unable to restrain Japan's atrocities. If China, in its disappointment at that time, had withdrawn from the League of Nations, the blow it would have dealt to the League would have been many times greater than Japan's withdrawal. However, China chose to exercise understanding to the fullest extent and remain with the League of Nations until the end. The cruelty of its sacrifices and the thoroughness of its protection are unparalleled among the member states. Now, China's request to be re-elected as a non-permanent member of the Administrative Council further demonstrates its utmost respect for the League of Nations. If this small request cannot be granted, the loss to the League of Nations will far exceed that to China. For China not to obtain a seat on the Administrative Council does not harm its national dignity, but without a Chinese representative on the Administrative Council, it will lack a link between the West and the East and be reduced to a purely European interest group. If this unfortunately happens, the true value of the League of Nations will be diminished.</p>
<p>(3) Technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China is effectively brought to fruition by the Administrative Council, and Japan's April 17th statement has already revealed its ability to make unreasonable threats. The Administrative Council and China share common interests and are interdependent in the face of Japan's strong opposition. The success of future technical cooperation depends on the joint efforts of the Administrative Council and China. If, at this crucial juncture, China's position in the League of Nations is adversely affected, it would be unfortunate for China and detrimental to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(4) As Chinese representative Guo Taiqi said, the Assembly has repeatedly stated that the election of non-permanent members should give due consideration to the size of each country's territory, and that Asia in particular should have ample representation on the Administrative Council. Today, our competitor for the Asian seat is Turkey. Turkey's territory is far smaller than ours, and it is a European nation, as it acknowledges in its request. It is clear that it is not qualified to compete with us. There can be no doubt that China should be re-elected.</p>
<p>(5) At yesterday's opening of the Assembly, temporary chairman Beneš strongly emphasized that the situation in the Far East cannot be ignored. China has always been the largest country in the Far East. Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, no one dares to challenge its qualification to represent the Far East in the League of Nations. Now, the accession of Soviet Russia has become a reality. It is generally recognized by discerning individuals that its impact will contribute to the stabilization of the Far Eastern situation. It is said that one of the conditions for Soviet Russia's accession is its election as a permanent member of the Administrative Council. If a permanent member, Soviet Russia, is added to the Administrative Council and a non-permanent member, China, is removed, China would inevitably feel a sense of regret, and it would be incomplete for the stabilization of the Far Eastern situation. Therefore, amid the news of Soviet Russia's accession, there is an even greater need to re-elect China as a member of the Council, so that China and Russia, in addition to normal diplomatic relations, can have a venue to work together for peace in the Far East.</p>

<p>Methods for Relieving the Changyuan Breach</p>

As for the funding issue, it amounts to approximately 200,000 yuan. Is it feasible for the province to quickly allocate 100,000 yuan, and the central government to provide a discretionary subsidy of 100,000 yuan, to be handed over to the committee to send personnel to organize a committee to keep, supervise the receipt and expenditure, and order the Hebei Yellow River Post-Disaster Engineering Office and the River Affairs Bureau to reinforce the old and new dikes, add revetment engineering, and strictly defend them? Resolved: Approved.</p>

<p>Ariyoshi Meets Wang to Discuss</p>
<p>Revision of Water Diversion Issue</p>
<p>Both Sides Advocate Legal Reservations</p>
<p>Hosted Banquet for Our Diplomatic Officials at the Japanese Consulate Last Night</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, accompanied by Ariyoshi Yano, called on Wang, who is both Premier and Foreign Minister, at his official residence at 4 p.m. The Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tang Youren, was present. The secretary, Huang Fengqin, translated. The conversation lasted for one hour and forty-five minutes. It is reported that although the Japanese ambassador's visit to Premier Wang was lengthy, it was mainly for pleasantries and inquiries about various situations. Only the issue of China's revision of the Water Diversion Regulations was discussed at length. The Japanese ambassador focused on raising legal opinions regarding the regulations. The Chinese side maintained that the revision of the regulations was difficult to change, and that it was scheduled to be implemented on October 1. Therefore, the legal views of both sides on the Water Diversion issue were not resolved at that time. Both sides reserved the right to address the remaining issues. In terms of facts, the Chinese side stated that it would not deny the established situation. Due to the Japanese ambassador's repeated statements, the conversation took a longer time. At 8 p.m. on the 11th, Ariyoshi invited Wang, who is also Foreign Minister, Vice Ministers Xu Mo and Tang Youren, Director of the Asian Department Shen Jinding, Director of the European and American Department Liu Shishun, Director of the International Department Zhu Hexiang, Director of the Information Department Li Dijun, and Director of the General Affairs Department Li Shengwu, a total of ten people, to a banquet at the Japanese Consulate. The German Consul Suma and Vice Consul Ioki accompanied them. According to diplomatic custom, official matters are not discussed during banquets. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, accompanied by Counselor Yano and Secretary Yokokawa, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 11th. Yano replied to the press on behalf of the ambassador, stating that the ambassador's visit was a routine courtesy call to the Chinese foreign affairs authorities, as it had been two months since his last visit. His meeting with Chairman Huang in Shanghai was also a routine visit and did not involve any important discussions. As for the diplomacy in the North China war zone, it is handled by the Pingzheng Committee in consultation with the Kwantung Army, so he was not aware of the recent situation. The rumor of the relocation of the embassy to the south had been considered before, but it was later shelved. There is no news at present. The ambassador plans to visit Ping in the near future to handle embassy affairs, sometime in October or at the latest in November. The ambassador will take the night train to Shanghai on the night of the 12th after visiting Premier Wang in the afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, accompanied by Counselor Yano and Secretary Yokokawa, arrived in Nanjing on the 10th at 11 p.m. on the Beijing-Shanghai night express, with a private carriage attached. They arrived at Xiaguan Station at 7 a.m. The Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, Suma, led consulate staff and more than ten Japanese residents to the station to welcome them. After Ariyoshi arrived at the station, Suma and others boarded the train to greet him, and then they disembarked together and walked out of the station, taking the cars prepared by the Japanese Consulate General to the city to rest. It is reported that Ariyoshi had telegraphed Suma from Shanghai to ask Foreign Minister Wang for a meeting time. After arriving in Nanjing on the 11th, he will visit the Ministry of Railways official residence at 4 p.m. at the time approved by Foreign Minister Wang for a routine visit. It is also reported that Ariyoshi is scheduled to host a banquet at the Japanese Consulate General at 8 p.m. on the 11th for the heads and vice ministers of our foreign ministry, as well as the directors of various departments, a total of more than ten people, to promote goodwill. Ariyoshi plans to stay in Nanjing for one night and return to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai night express at 11 p.m. on the 11th. According to Yano, a Chinese counselor who accompanied Ariyoshi to Nanjing, Ambassador Ariyoshi has been staying in Shanghai to avoid the summer heat since his last visit to Wang and Chiang, and he has not been to Nanjing for two months. Now that the summer heat is over and the weather is cool, he has made a special visit to the diplomatic authorities of your country as a routine courtesy call and has no special mission. The ambassador plans to visit Premier Wang this afternoon, stay in Nanjing for one night, and take the Beijing-Shanghai night express back to Shanghai tomorrow night. The ambassador plans to go north to Ping recently, around November. There was a proposal to move the Japanese embassy to Nanjing, which was later shelved, and there is no news of a move to the south recently. Also, the ambassador met with Huang Fu in Shanghai, but this meeting was because they had not seen each other for many days, so it was a purely private visit and no items were discussed. In addition to ordinary greetings, the North China affairs were also mentioned slightly. As for the various matters in the North China war zone, Huang and the Kwantung Army are currently negotiating and resolving them, so we are not very familiar with the recent progress. There is no basis for the rumor that Ambassador Ariyoshi will resign in September. The existing facts prove it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ariyoshi, accompanied by Yano, took a car to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways at 4 p.m. on the 11th to visit Wang, who is also Foreign Minister. Tang Youren was also present. Secretary Huang Chaoqin served as interpreter. The conversation lasted until 5:45 p.m., when Ariyoshi took his leave and returned to the Japanese Embassy to rest. It is reported that Ariyoshi's visit to Wang, in addition to ordinary greetings, also touched on the issue of revising the Water Diversion Regulations. Our authorities believe that in legal terms, our side can propose revisions at any time. He said that before the revisions, it is necessary to seek the opinions of the other party. Both sides expressed their opinions at length. As a result, both sides advocated reservations on the legal aspects, but our side also does not deny the past facts. Tang Youren told reporters at noon on the 11th that he had met with Huang Fu in Shanghai, and he will come to Nanjing within a few days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Youren returned to Nanjing from Shanghai by express train at 11 p.m. on the 10th, arriving at Hepingmen Station at 6:40 a.m. on the 11th. He disembarked and entered the city, returning to his residence to rest for a while. At 8 a.m., he went to the Administrative Yuan to attend the meeting. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Jimi and Luanyu</p>
<p>Rectification in Two Regions</p>
<p>After Yu Xuezhong Arrives in Ping</p>
<p>Xueyin and Others Discuss</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping yesterday morning, he attended a meeting of the board of directors of the Tram Company in the afternoon. After the meeting, Yin Tong visited him to exchange views on the rectification of the Jimi and Luanyu regions. It is reported that regarding the exchange of defenses between the old and new security teams, our side will appropriately reduce the number of personnel. Tao Shangming also arrived in Beiping last night and will meet with Yin Tong and Yin Rugeng tonight to discuss everything. Tao said that the implementation methods of the war zone rectification do not need to be decided by the meeting, because everything now is like the arrangement of roles in a play, it is no longer a matter of affairs, but a matter of people. Currently, the war zone lacks a Zhao Zilong. I came to Beiping to ask Yu for instructions, and I plan to go to Tianjin tomorrow to contact the Japanese side on everything. I will return to Tangshan after staying in Tianjin for a short time. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese and Korean ronin east of Tangshan have recently established a certain club, and there are countless gamblers. The various clubs draw betting patterns, and at night there are pai gow gambling dens, making noise until dawn. The police cannot crack down on them. In the Kailuan five mining areas of Tangshan, there are more than ten gambling dens. The workers are greedy for profit and forget the harm, and gambling is extremely prevalent. There are also daily reports of women losing their chastity due to gambling. Tao Shangming plans to discuss with Yin Tong and Yin Rugeng this time to decide on intentions and submit to Chai Shan the research on the Japanese and Korean ronin crackdown.

<p>Roosevelt Plans to Suggest to Various Countries</p>
<p>National Management of Munitions Manufacturing</p>
<p>British Conditional Approval of Arms Embargo on Bolivia</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Matin received news from about that "President Roosevelt is reportedly planning to suggest to major countries that the manufacturing of all armaments be nationalized and strictly managed so that there will be no private manufacturers of armaments in the future. This suggestion will be submitted by the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, to the presidium of the Disarmament Conference in Geneva in October or November." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The ban on supplying armaments and other war materials to Bolivia and Paraguay has been discussed for a long time and is now likely to become a reality. Britain today sent a letter to the League of Nations stating that Britain will take the necessary steps to ban the shipment of armaments, other war materials, and aircraft to the two South American countries, as it has reached the necessary agreement based on the proposal submitted on May 19 to cut off arms supplies to the two countries. However, Britain reserves the right to reconsider its approach in the event that other relevant governments disregard the same plan. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>US Arms Investigation</p>
<p>Britain Sells Off Large Quantities of Post-War Surplus Arms</p>
<p>Tome Company Resells to South America</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Special Committee, while investigating the relationship between American arms factories and other countries today, read out a letter regarding the sale of large quantities of British post-war surplus arms. The letter was from Mr. Baer, general manager of the London Sula Armaments Company, to Mr. Milander, chairman of the American Armaments Company. It stated that Sula Company has modernized and sold to the British government the remaining armaments from the Great War, worth about six million pounds, and requested that the American Armaments Company act as its agent to sell these armaments to the Latin American nations, but not to the revolutionaries in Nicaragua, so as not to hinder American interests there. According to Milander's testimony, President Roosevelt's order prohibiting the export of armaments to Bolivia and Paraguay caused the American Armaments Company to lose arms orders worth 1.62 million yuan.

<p>(Washington) The Senate committee investigating arms trafficking continued to meet and summoned leaders of various explosives manufacturers to testify. The leaders requested that their testimony not be disclosed, but Committee Chairman Nye refused. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) A letter from Mr. Baer, general manager of the London Sula Armaments Company, to the American Armaments Company stated that the US government's sale of machine guns, etc., could help China resist Japan, but Mr. Milander, chairman of the American Armaments Company, firmly stated that the US government had not engaged in such behavior. Milander issued a letter stating that he felt that female aviators Nicholas O'hart and Smith's operation of this business was extremely beneficial. After this letter was released, Ms. Nicholas filed a serious protest, stating that she had never made this transaction with Milander or anyone else. The chairman of the Senate Investigating Committee has asked Milander to retract this statement. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Russian Railway Employees Continue to Be Arrested</p>
<p>Subjected to Torture and Forced Confession</p>
<p>(Moscow) A dispatch from Harbin stated that the relatives of the Soviet railway employees arrested in the Chinese Eastern Railway are extremely anxious about their fate due to the plight of the arrested persons. This anxiety has been heightened since the facts of their being beaten and severely tortured were revealed. The Japanese and Manchukuo authorities do not allow them to meet with visitors and are not allowed to receive gifts of food. It is said that if they do not tell the lies required by the other party during interrogation, they will be severely tortured to make them "confess." The Soviet Consul General in Harbin has again made strong representations to the Manchurian authorities regarding these facts.</p>
<p>Another dispatch from Harbin stated that the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities' excesses on the Chinese Eastern Railway and the unwarranted arrests of Soviet railway employees are still continuing. On September 4, Japanese soldiers forcibly occupied the stationmaster's office and staff residences at Ugunor Station as a garrison. The wife of Soviet citizen Mostaev was beaten for refusing to give way. After a protest by the Soviet Consulate in Manzhouli, the Japanese soldiers left the office and staff residences.</p>
<p>Manzhouli Station Master Soviet citizen Shablinki was arrested on September 6. The Soviet Consulate immediately protested to the authorities. On the same day, Soviet citizen Maflengo and his wife and brother were also arrested and released the next day. Soviet citizen Goring, a machinist, was kidnapped by bandits during the train accident on August 5. On September 6, he escaped and arrived at Xiao Jiuzhuang (transliteration). According to Goring, Soviet ticket seller Ivanov was kidnapped at the same time as him and died on August 11 due to being beaten by bandits. On September 4, the son of ticket seller Tavenkov and the son of hospital employee Inenkovski were kidnapped by bandits at Hengdaohezi Station.</p>
<p>The newspapers in Harbin are silent about these facts and continue to fabricate rumors and slander, falsely claiming that Soviet employees are "colluding" with bandits.</p>
<p>The Moscow press pointed out that the newspapers in Harbin were uneasy about the Tokyo press's claim that the reopening of the Chinese Eastern Railway sales conference was both possible and extremely necessary. They opposed the reopening of negotiations under the direction of Japanese aggressors in Manchuria. (TASS dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Soviet Russia and Puppet State</p>

<p>(Harbin) On September 3, Soviet Russian troops entered a village in Dongning County, claiming that the village was within the Soviet Russian border, and ordered the residents to move within three days. Subsequently, Soviet Russian farmers went to occupy the village. Manchukuo diplomat Shi Luben visited Russian Consul Lai Weichi today and submitted a protest letter, demanding that the Russian farmers withdraw from the village and guaranteeing that there would be no such behavior in the future.

<p>Reform of the Puppet Administration</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister's Compromise Plan</p>
<p>Superficial Respect for Proposals from Other Provinces</p>
<p>Actual Compliance with the Intentions of the Military Department</p>
<p>The Colonization Ministry Is Dissatisfied with the Loss of Real Power</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the government's plan for reforming the administrative organization in Manchukuo, as formulated by Secretary Kawada, is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The current state of "Manchukuo" is that it has external relations with China and Russia, and internal domestic security issues, and has not yet reached the stage of implementing a civil administration. Although the plan of the Colonization Ministry is a complete civil administration plan, it is not convenient to implement it at present, so a military and political system must be temporarily adopted.</p>
<p>(2) The ambassador to Manchukuo will be managed by the Prime Minister of the Cabinet to strengthen the form of national unity. However, purely diplomatic affairs will be supervised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>(3) From the perspective of administrative evolution, Kwantung Prefecture should be placed under the administration of the Colonization Ministry. However, because the area controls the throat of "Manchukuo" and is strategically important, it should be managed by a special agency stationed in Manchukuo. (4) A bureau for Manchukuo affairs will be established in the central government as a policy-making body for Manchukuo. (Japan United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After today's cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Okada requested that Minister of the Army Hayashi and Minister of Foreign Affairs Hirota stay for a discussion on the issue of reforming the organization in Manchukuo. At that time, a compromise plan was put forward based on personal opinions. The two ministers, Hayashi and Hirota, who accepted the plan, did not reply at that time and resigned and returned to their official residences. Both sides held provincial meetings, and the heads of departments continued to discuss and coordinate. However, both ministries seemed quite dissatisfied with the compromise plan, so it is feared that reaching an agreement will be quite difficult. (Dentsu dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Colonization Ministry is absolutely opposed to the compromise plan put forward by Prime Minister Okada, because the administrative power of Kwantung Prefecture, the administrative power of the Manchuria Railway affiliated land, and the supervision power of the Manchuria Railway, telegraphs, telephones, and special companies, which have always been under the direct jurisdiction of the Colonization Ministry, have been deprived of all important items in the Manchukuo policy. All that remains is the significance of colonization, resulting in the complete loss of the right to speak on important matters of the Manchukuo policy in the future. The Colonization Ministry is equal to a waste product, so the entire Colonization Ministry expresses its absolute opposition. (Dentsu dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) (11th) The attitudes of the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Colonization towards the compromise plan formulated by the Cabinet are generally as follows:</p>
<p>"Ministry of Foreign Affairs" If the command system follows the current situation, it generally agrees with the compromise plan. It will try to negotiate and resolve one or two issues that are not very satisfactory in the future.</p>
<p>"Ministry of the Army" Although it has not clearly expressed its attitude of approval or disapproval, it generally believes that the compromise plan recognizes what the Army advocates, so it does not strongly oppose it.</p>
<p>"Ministry of Colonization" According to this plan, the Colonization Ministry is only left with the supervisory power of its immigration business, which is very pessimistic. (Japan United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Germany Bans Import of Japanese Silk</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Impose Retaliation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The German government announced an import quota order for Japanese rayon in April this year, stipulating that the trade status in 1931 should be used as the standard, limiting the import volume of Japanese rayon to 75% of that amount. Because Japanese rayon exports to Germany in 1931 were almost non-existent, the German government's quota order is equivalent to a ban. On May 17, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Nagai, was instructed to demand that the German government change the base year on the grounds of violating the most-favored-nation treaty. However, on the 6th, the German government replied to Ambassador Nagai that Germany could not accept Japan's request because it had an agreement with a third country. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is concerned that this matter will have a significant impact on Japanese-German trade and is considering countermeasures, planning to launch the Trade Protection Act as retaliation.

<p>Amidst the Compromise between Italy and France</p>
<p>Residents of Rhodes Demonstrate Against Italy</p>
<p>Balbo's Parade and Speech</p>
<p>His Escape by Yacht Was Quite Embarrassing</p>
<p>Belgrade The parade and speech of Air Force Commander Balbo encountered a very unpleasant demonstration in Split, Yugoslavia yesterday. Balbo and his entourage had to leave in a state of embarrassment and take refuge on a yacht moored in the port. There is great anger here about this matter, and even moderate parties say that Balbo's trip was unfortunate, as it coincided with a tense atmosphere of compromise between Italy and France. Balbo's parade along the Dalmatian coast passed through Kotor, Dubrovnik, Nikšić, and Split. In Split, he gave a speech to 150 Italians in a club. The fanatical Italians shouted slogans such as "Long live Italy!" The windows of the club were all open, and the Yugoslavs gathered outside the windows believed that the Italians were deliberately provoking them, so the momentum was fierce and they wanted to attack the club, but they were dispersed by the police. The police faced great difficulties and were able to clear the streets. Balbo was able to escape. Many demonstrators were arrested, and the Italians were trapped in the club. They were only able to leave after the streets were cleared. (National News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>National Socialist Party Congress Concludes</p>
<p>Hitler's Speech</p>
<p>Outdated Political Parties Emphasize Personal Interests</p>
<p>National Socialism Has a New World View</p>
<p>Nuremberg The German leader, Hitler, made the following important speech this afternoon at the closing of the National Socialist Party Congress: "The Sixth National Socialist Party Congress is about to close. In the eyes of the millions of Germans who are not in our party and foreigners in general, this is nothing more than an extraordinary manifestation of our party's expansion of political power. But in our eyes, its importance far exceeds this. The difference between all outdated political parties and National Socialism is that only this kind of grand gathering can make it more obvious. Even when we were opposing the government, we often convened congresses to show the unity of the leaders and party members. Other gatherings, such as those of Marxists and the bourgeoisie, are merely private meetings of a few leaders, and no one can claim that their voters are sincerely in agreement. Furthermore, looking at the outlines of the gatherings of these political parties, it is clear that they lack a global perspective. They cannot abandon their personal interests and fight for noble causes. The reason why the National Socialist movement is different from all past associations today is that National Socialism is entirely based on a new world view. Only National Socialism still has the name of a party. From the beginning, I felt that there was also a special point between a sincere believer and a real activist of a belief, just as an idea can attract the obedience of fifty or sixty million people in a certain environment, but it will feel impossible to make these fifty or sixty million people act enthusiastically and practically at the same time." Hitler then elaborated on the previous party organizations based on religious beliefs, social classes, and economic interests, and said that these past political parties had a common characteristic for the new movement of National Socialism, that is, "Not only can they not destroy us, but they are always in a state of fear of being destroyed. But the German people are now convinced that the new movement fully represents the advantages of the nation and the nation, so the number of people who join every day is increasing. What the people demand today is to create a new environment with the skills of new politicians, so that the general good people, regardless of their wealth or poverty, can work. But our ultimate goal is to make the people of the whole country National Socialists. Of course, among the National Socialists, only the best National Socialists can be members of the National Socialist Party. Furthermore, if the bourgeoisie does not understand this principle and asks from time to time whether the German people will permanently accommodate the rule of a small number of people, we have two answers to this question: (1) No country has yet completed the rule of the majority, and the rulers all belong to the minority; (2) If the purpose of this minority does not conflict with the majority, then the proposition of the minority is purely for the country and the people, and there is no need to guess."

<p>Morro Castle Disaster</p>
<p>Suspected Arson</p>
<p>The Ship Had Lost Power Before the Fire Was Reported</p>
<p>The Captain Had No History of Heart Disease, So the Cause of Death Is Suspicious</p>
<p>(New York) The number of deaths in the Morro Castle disaster on Saturday is still unknown, but according to the latest figures, 79 people have been identified as dead, including Captain Weymot. In addition, there are 27 missing passengers and 29 crew members. Assuming that none of the missing survived, the total number of deaths will be 159. There are various rumors, such as the ship was set on fire, the crew was undisciplined, and the equipment on board was substandard. Acting Captain Holmes said that the fire was caused by arson. He also said that Captain Weymot died of indigestion and heart failure before the fire. He learned of the fire on board at 2:45 a.m. on September 8. About 15 minutes later, he ordered that all crew members and passengers be awakened. Holmes also said that during the last voyage, someone had tried to set fire to the ship. After the fire broke out this time, one of the lifeboats that was lowered suddenly caught fire. Based on these circumstances, he believes that the fire was caused by arson. The New York Evening Post reported that the family of the deceased Captain Weymot will demand a thorough investigation into the cause of the captain's death. Weymot's family claimed that the claim that he died of heart disease was unreliable, as Weymot had no history of heart disease. Acting Captain Holmes' testimony to the investigating committee included that the ship's steam power had been lost before the fire was reported and that the ship could not move.

<p>Havana Officials here stated today that the Morro Castle shipwreck may have been caused by arson by communists. Havana Port Director Hernandez told the Associated Press that he had learned that there was a communist on board the ship carrying many chemicals when it left here, and that the Caribbean branch of the Third International was also in Havana. Hernandez also said that he had recently received threats to blow up the aircraft of various American airlines. The US government investigation department has begun investigating Hernandez's remarks.

<p>(New York) A formal investigation into the Morro Castle shipwreck, which was burned on Saturday morning, was held here today by the Department of Commerce Investigation Office in the Federal District Court. It is said to have been arson by a madman or a communist, not an electrical fault. The crew members' testimony of the terrible situation at the time was unbearable to hear. They said that the passengers were panicked and disordered, which made the crew completely powerless. Some had already escaped to the deck, but because they were too frightened, they returned to the fire. Many others were unconscious from drinking too much alcohol the night before. Although the crew knocked on doors and called out everywhere, they</p>

<p>Johnson Returned Home Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Others Personally Went to the Wharf to See Him Off</p>
<p>And Presented Mr. Johnson with Two Bouquets of Flowers to Wish Him Well</p>
<p>Baron and Mrs. Johnson, the special envoy sent by the King of Belgium to China as an envoy of gratitude, left Shanghai on the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso at 9:40 a.m. yesterday to return home. Of the personnel who came with him, Johnson's son, Andrew Johnson, and Colonel Monte, a military attaché, took the Dollar Line's President Coolidge to the United States at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The other members of the delegation are currently staying in Shanghai for business and will return to Belgium in succession. The Belgian Minister, Mr. and Mrs. Ghiotti, Belgian Consul-General Tan Erfu, Consul Hu Bieyi, Hua Bi Bank General Manager Shi Mengzi, Hai Si, president of the Chamber of Commerce, and Mayor Wu of this city, Ministry of Foreign Affairs representatives Wang Yanxi, Lin Tongshi, and Zhao Tiezhang, acting director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, all personally went to the wharf to see him off. The Municipal Security Department also sent 200 honor guards to maintain order at the port. The Public Security Bureau's military band also played the Belgian national anthem to see them off. Mayor Wu also prepared two bouquets of flowers and had Miss Gan Shuxian present them to Mr. and Mrs. Johnson separately on the ship to wish them well.</p>
<p>Autumn Floods Have Arrived</p>
<p>This City is Hastening to Repair the Sea Dikes</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Meeting Has Approved an Expenditure of 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>To Be Transferred First from the Municipal Public Bond Slaughterhouse Funds</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The east and west dikes of this city are more than 18 kilometers long and protect the lives and property of the people of Songhu, allowing them to live in peace. However, they have been damaged over the years. For example, the typhoon on August 24, 1931, breached the two dikes by more than 300 meters. After the emergency repairs at that time, more than 1,500 meters of piles and stone foundations were added. On September 2 and 18 of last year, the two typhoons weakened the defense of the dikes, and more than 1,000 meters were breached at the same time in the areas where piles and stone foundations had not been added before. At that time, the municipal treasury could only slightly fill the breaches in the earthen dikes because the budget did not specify special funds. All the projects that should have added piles and stone foundations were still unable to be carried out. The line of remnant dikes is usually dangerous due to erosion. Now that the autumn floods are approaching, it is inevitable that wind and tides will attack. It is urgent to start construction to defend against them. It is reported that the budget for the pile and stone foundation work that should be done this year requires more than 1 million yuan. The municipal authorities, limited by funds, have to start repairing the most dangerous sections first. It is estimated that this project, at a minimum, should be more than 1,800 meters, costing more than 200,000 yuan. The 263rd municipal government meeting was held to discuss and approve an expenditure of 200,000 yuan. In order to deal with the urgent situation, it was decided to transfer funds from this year's municipal public bond slaughterhouse funds first, and the Finance Bureau will find a way to repay them. It is also reported that the regulations and design of the slaughterhouse project still require time, and the funds required are huge and cannot be completed with a small amount of funds. Now that such a flexible approach has been taken, the slaughterhouse project can be funded at leisure without affecting the fundamental plan. The important dike project can be implemented immediately. The city government has reported this situation of shifting from slow to urgent and taking care of both to the Executive Yuan for approval. It was submitted and approved at the second regular meeting of the New Public Bond Supervision and Use Committee the other day (7th).</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng Went to Beijing Yesterday</p>
<p>Successful in Obtaining a Loan to Divert the Wei River</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Yang Hucheng, director of the Shaanxi Pacification Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai last month to discuss the matter of borrowing money to divert the Wei River with Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi, standing members of the National Economic Commission, and the Shanghai banking community. An agreement has now been reached, so Mr. Yang took the overnight express train to Beijing last night. The railway bureau specially added a decorated car. Dozens of people, including Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin, went to the station to see him off. It is reported that Tang Niuzhi, Ma Chaojun, and Yang Dezhao also traveled with him. Before leaving, Mr. Yang told a Central News Agency reporter that he had been ordered to go to Jiangxi last month to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang. When he started from Shaanxi, the Shaanxi Provincial Government decided to carry out the Wei River water conservancy project, and Chairman Shao specially entrusted him to go to Shanghai to discuss investment matters with the central government and the banking community. After arriving in Shanghai, he received a lot of support from Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, Dai Jitao, and other dignitaries, and the banking community was enthusiastic. An agreement has been reached on the investment in the Wei River diversion project. The approximate amount of investment is within 2 million yuan, to be repaid in four years, shared by five banks including the Bank of China. His negotiations have come to an end. As for the specific contract, the branches of each bank in Shaanxi must discuss the details with the provincial government. If you want to know the details of the Wei River diversion, it cannot be explained in a short time. The Shaanxi Wei River Diversion Project Office has printed a report explaining it, which is specially forwarded for reference. His contact with the banking community is also based on this. After arriving in Shanghai, because he had to write to Chairman Shao to describe the details of the contact and wait for a reply, he took the time to visit the Hangzhou Air Force School and inquire about Chairman Lu's health. He saw that all the undertakings in Hangzhou and Zhejiang Province were making great progress, which shows the construction talents of Chairman Lu, Mayor Zhou, and other comrades in Zhejiang Province, which he admires very much. Before leaving, he was introduced by the municipal government to visit the major national product factories in Shanghai, because Shaanxi's construction is agricultural, and he intends to consult with Chairman Shao and turn to the promotion of industry, so he took the opportunity to visit for reference.</p>
<p>Gold Industry</p>
<p>The Exchange Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Yang Yinpu Talks About the Relationship Between Bank Foreign Exchange and Gold Speculation</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: After the Ministry of Finance ordered restrictions on foreign exchange and cracked down on gold speculation, the Gold Exchange closed the market the day before yesterday. After discussing the measures, the market opened as usual yesterday morning. The market was very calm. Yesterday morning, a New Voice News Agency reporter visited economic expert Yang Yinpu to inquire about the relationship between the bank's foreign exchange department and the gold speculation market and the situation of gold settlement. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Yinpu Talks About Regulating Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yang Yinpu, the former president of the National Shanghai College of Commerce, told the New Voice News Agency that China is a silver-using country, and the currencies of other countries are calculated in gold. The rise and fall of the US exchange rate or the British exchange rate are roughly the same as the price of the gold speculation market. Therefore, if the bank's foreign exchange department opens tens of thousands of US dollar bills, and there is no such US dollar storage at that time, if the US dollar exchange rate rises sharply the next day, the bank will suffer losses. Therefore, in order to avoid danger, it immediately purchases a considerable amount of gold bars from the gold speculation market. When the transaction is completed, the price is settled in US dollars. Regardless of the rise or fall, those who operate foreign exchange can avoid losses. If gold trading must be settled in spot goods, because the United Kingdom and the United States are not actually on the gold standard, the proportion of the rise and fall of gold prices and foreign exchange is not the same. The foreign exchange must be regulated in other ways, otherwise it will inevitably reduce business to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Exchange Trading is Not Speculation</p>
<p>There are speculators mixed in among those who do hedging in the exchange, but the bank's foreign exchange department is definitely not speculation. It is inevitable to reduce risks. For example, after a flour mill purchases a large batch of wheat, if it must be sold after grinding the wheat into flour, the market price may fluctuate greatly after a few months, and the selling price may be below cost. Therefore, in order to reduce this kind of danger, the factory throws out flour futures on the flour exchange, because the difference between the price of flour and the price of wheat is relatively small in the same period. The same is true for yarn and cloth. Therefore, the existence of the exchange is really necessary. However, others who buy empty and sell empty without manufacturing plants are speculators.</p>
<p>Changing the Standard Reduces the Difference</p>
<p>The reporter continued to inquire about the gold settlement method and the differences between the past and the present. Yang replied that the gold price was previously settled in Japanese yen. After the September 18th Incident, it was changed to US dollars, that is, one tael of gold (ten taels) was equal to 346 US dollars. Now the London gold block price is used as the standard (that is, customs gold, because customs gold is calculated at the gold block price), that is, one tael of gold is equal to 507 yuan and 8 cents of customs gold. In today's market price, the US exchange rate is 34 yuan and 8 cents and 7 cents (equal to 100 yuan of national currency). Calculated at this price, each tael is equal to 992 yuan. Customs gold is 1 yuan and 926, and the gold price is 978 yuan per tael. Today's gold price is 956 yuan. Comparing it with the old and new standards, the US exchange rate difference is 36 yuan, and the customs gold difference is only 22 yuan, a reduction of more than one-third.</p>
<p>New International Exchange Standard</p>
<p>Central Bank Officially Posts Prices Yesterday</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Shift Focus</p>
<p>From HSBC to the Central Bank</p>
<p>The Most Meaningful Page in Financial History</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order on the 9th to crack down on gold speculation and all transactions must be settled in cash, both the gold industry and the commodity gold industry stopped trading the day before yesterday and held meetings to discuss follow-up measures. As a result, an agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Finance to use customs gold as the settlement standard. However, customs gold is also a hypothetical unit, and it must still be converted based on the London gold block price. The Central Bank has officially posted the standard gold price and customs gold price every morning starting yesterday. The standard of international exchange rates, such as the US dollar, shilling, franc, and rupee, was previously based on the HSBC posting. The Shanghai exchange market has followed this practice for a long time and it has become a custom, and no one dares to violate it. Since the establishment of the Central Bank, although it has also followed the functions of the central banks of various countries to expand its power, it also has a standard exchange rate posting like HSBC. However, in the market practice, the HSBC posting is still the standard, and the Central Bank posting is equivalent to a mere formality. Moreover, the standard price of gold speculation has never been posted by HSBC or the Central Bank in the past. It is up to the exchange to open and fluctuate. Since yesterday, the Central Bank has posted the standard price based on the London gold block price, which is: (1) One tael of gold per market (ten taels) is equal to 507 units of customs gold, 79 equal to 978 silver yuan. (2) Each gold unit is equal to 1 yuan, 9 jiao, 2 fen and 6 li of silver yuan. From now on, the focus of exchange rates will shift from HSBC to the Central Bank. The Central Bank's function in exchange rates has been expanded, and it is the initial success of managing exchange rates. It is really the most memorable page in financial history. After November 15, the gold transaction settlement will also be based on the new standard posted by the Central Bank, which will reduce the exchange rate difference and stabilize the market.</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang's Circular</p>
<p>Eliminate Labor Disputes and Stabilize Society</p>
<p>First Strictly Prohibit the Collection of Fees from Workers</p>
<p>The Standard Daily Working Hours is Ten Hours</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government received a circular from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission in Nanchang yesterday: It has been ordered to prohibit factory workers from striking and slowing down work, and factory owners from abusing workers. The collection of fees from workers by factory unions should be strictly investigated and prohibited. There should also be standard working hours for workers to comply with. Instructions are given separately below:</p>
<p>Prohibit the Collection of Fees from Workers</p>
<p>Strictly prohibit factory unions from collecting all kinds of fees from workers. Eliminating labor disputes and stabilizing society is the most important plan in the bandit suppression area at present. The main reason for the occurrence of labor disputes in the past is the request for wage increases. Therefore, eliminating labor disputes can effectively reduce the economic pain of workers. Factory unions have always collected membership fees or other fees from workers, causing the income of workers' blood and sweat to be subjected to unnecessary exploitation. Hereafter, factory unions are not allowed to collect membership fees and all other fees from workers. It must be known that reducing workers' expenses is equivalent to increasing workers' income. This should be strictly investigated and prohibited.</p>
<p>The Standard Daily Working Hours is Ten Hours</p>
<p>Except for child labor, the daily working hours of factory workers should be ten hours as the standard. Although eight hours of work is the general practice in various countries, the main purpose of its legislation is to curb overproduction. My country's production industry is already backward, and there is no fear of overproduction, but there is a fear of inadequacy. It is not necessary to describe in detail the non-policy of curbing overproduction in a country that is inadequate.</p>
<p>Labor and Management Share a Common Livelihood</p>
<p>The previously issued orders must be carefully observed. Factory owners are not allowed to abuse workers. If there is abuse, the workers in that area can truthfully report to the provincial and district local officials, who will report it to this headquarters for fair handling. There will be no partiality, so that both parties can be treated equally and share a common livelihood, in order to jointly save the economic difficulties. This is very important. In addition to the separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance. After receiving the order, the Municipal Party Headquarters, etc., immediately transferred the order to the factory unions to implement and comply with it.</p>
<p>Swedish Consul General Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Linde Kui Zi Te, the Swedish Consul General in Shanghai, has completed his trip to Japan and North China and has returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chinese Expelled from Japan</p>
<p>The Third Batch Returned Home Yesterday</p>
<p>Three Representatives Were Elected to Go to Beijing by Overnight Train</p>
<p>To Petition the Central Government and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: After the first and second batches of Chinese expelled from Japan returned home, the third batch was detained by the Moji Police Station, so it did not arrive in Shanghai until 8:00 a.m. yesterday on the Japanese postal ship Fushimi Maru. There were still six people who were too seriously injured when boarding the ship in Moji and are currently in the hospital for treatment and were unable to come to Shanghai. The overseas Chinese who have already returned home urgently need to report everything to the central government and ask for prompt relief. Therefore, three representatives were elected to go to Beijing by overnight train last night to pay their respects to the authorities. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The third batch of Chinese expelled from Japan returned home on the Japanese postal ship Fushimi Maru and arrived at the Huishan Wharf at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. All the overseas Chinese who had arrived in Shanghai went to the wharf to welcome them. The overseas Chinese who came to Shanghai this time were all full of sorrow, dressed untidily, and mentally depressed, with scars all over their bodies, which was extremely tragic. After landing, they all temporarily stayed at the Daxin Public Inn.</p>
<p>A Group of Seven People</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese who came to Shanghai this time included Ye Jinshun, Wang Jinbao, Ji Zhongchang, Hu Jiada, Zhou Baozhen, Pan Yichuan, and Hu Zidao. There were still six people, including Pan Rishun, Zhou Yishun, Chen Yan Gao, Dai Changtao, Wu Linhao, and Zhou Rixin, who were prevented from boarding the ship in Moji by the Japanese police and were seriously injured, so they had to return halfway and be treated in the Moji hospital. It is difficult to predict when they will be able to return home after being treated.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Abused</p>
<p>Among the seven overseas Chinese who were forced to return home this time, one of them, Zhou Baozhen, was thrown into the sea by the Japanese police when boarding the ship in Moji and almost drowned. Fortunately, he was rescued. Mr. Zhou told a Central News Agency reporter that he and others had been in Japan for many years, and some had married Japanese women. Now, because they cannot bear the persecution of the Japanese, they reluctantly returned home. They originally intended to bring their wives and children back with them, but the Japanese, on the one hand, summoned Japanese women to carry out various counter-propaganda against the abuse of wives and daughters by the Chinese, and on the other hand, forced the Chinese not to bring women back. They strongly protested against their unreasonable obstruction and finally incurred the wrath of the Japanese police. He was thrown into the sea by the Japanese police and rescued by fellow overseas Chinese. The Japanese onlookers insulted him for committing suicide, thinking that he had implicated the Japanese and beat him severely. Fortunately, he was persuaded by fellow overseas Chinese and was able to return home alive. There were also six fellow overseas Chinese, including Pan Rishun, who were temporarily staying in the hospital for treatment due to serious injuries. It is difficult to predict when they will be able to return.</p>
<p>Allocate Funds for Relief</p>
<p>Li Zhujian and Tan Zhonglu, who were sent by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Shanghai to take care of the overseas Chinese who were forced to return home, were instructed by telegram from Chen Shuren, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, to temporarily allocate 5 yuan of temporary relief funds to each person. Yesterday morning, they took the funds to the Daxin Public Inn and distributed them to the first, second, and third batches of returned overseas Chinese by name. Although the money was a drop in the bucket, it was enough to help them in the current extremely difficult economic situation. Therefore, each of them filled out a receipt and received the money.</p>
<p>Representatives Went to Beijing</p>
<p>The returned overseas Chinese had previously planned to go to Nanjing to petition the central government as a whole. Subsequently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission ordered Li Zhujian and Tan Zhonglu, who were sent to Shanghai, to inform the overseas Chinese that they were allowed to elect representatives to come to Beijing. After receiving the letter, the overseas Chinese gathered yesterday morning and decided to elect Chen Fengqing, Xia Yongchang, and Yang Zhan Kong to take the letter to Beijing by the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train last night to petition three agencies: the Central Party Headquarters, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Because they were unfamiliar with the place after going to Beijing, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters again yesterday afternoon to request that a letter of introduction be issued so that they could contact all parties after arriving in Beijing.</p>

<p>Eurasia Company's New Aircraft</p>
<p>Took Off Yesterday Morning and Arrived in Beiping at Noon</p>
<p>A Distance of 1,300 Kilometers</p>
<p>Only Takes Four Hours and Twenty-Five Minutes</p>
<p>The new Junkers 52 large aircraft of the Eurasia Aviation Company was still flown by Baron Gebelenz, general manager of the German Lufthansa Company, from Hongqiao Airport at 7:50 a.m. yesterday to Beiping. German Consul-General Mitscher, Toddman of the German Company in China, Deputy Director Weng Tuote, Mechanic Ke Qihoff, Telegrapher Hansgen, Eurasia Aviation Company's Aviation Group Director Meng Tiefu, and German Envoy's girlfriend Wu Yulangski, and other seven people, took the same plane to Beiping. According to the company secretary, Mr. Zha Zhenwu, yesterday afternoon, the plane arrived safely in Beiping at 12:15 p.m. All the staff of the Eurasia Beijing branch and local agencies warmly welcomed them at the airport. According to their telegram, it broke the new world record. The distance from Shanghai to Beiping is 1,300 kilometers, and it only took four hours and twenty-five minutes from taking off at 7:50 a.m. to arriving at 12:15 p.m. In the past, the company's flights to Beiping took at least seven hours. Ordinary aircraft can fly 160 to 170 kilometers per hour. The fastest speed of the giant aircraft is 270 to 280 kilometers per hour. This can be seen from the structure of the new aircraft. In addition, after the aircraft departed from Berlin on the 29th of last month, it did not dare to open the speed because it was not familiar with the route, so it took 70 hours to fly to Shanghai. If the record of today (that is, yesterday) is followed, then in the future, after the direct flight between China and Germany, the flight with this aircraft can be reduced by 10 hours. It only takes 60 hours to reach 15,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>The Disturbance in Changle Lane</p>
<p>Police Officers Beat Tenants</p>
<p>Municipal Federation and Others Petition</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: The houses in Changle Lane, Dixiwei Road, are the legacy of Ye Chengzhong and were completed in January 1932. They are rented by the British firm Taili Foreign Firm. At 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Taili Foreign Firm suddenly requested the police station to send Chinese and Western police officers and a large team of police cars to the lane to beat many tenants, which caused a disturbance. The tenants in the lane petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee and the Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens' Federation to ask for assistance and relief. The Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee sent two representatives, Wei Langxuan and Cai Qiaojun, with a letter to ask Hua Dong Yu Qiaqing to uphold justice and make representations to the Public Works Bureau to demand compensation for damages and punish the police officers who beat people. The Municipal Federation sent Zhang Yichen, Zhang Xianfang, Chen Jiufeng, Zhou Fuzhang, and others as representatives to ask He Dekui of the Public Works Bureau to investigate and deal with the police officers who committed the crime, and sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, which said: "We have received a letter from the Rent Reduction Branch of Changle Lane, No. 807 Dixiwei Road, stating that this lane is the legacy of Ye Chengzhong and was built in 1932. The houses were rented starting in January. There are 62 houses in total, including 11 Japanese households. Due to the economic downturn, the remote location, and the high rent, they cannot afford to pay. Therefore, they are slightly in arrears. It was found that Zhou Tienong, a tenant at No. 27 in this lane, owed rent for January to April, a total of four months. The court mediation was established, and one month was allocated each month until August, when it was completely paid off. Subsequently, the court summons was received, and the execution court was opened on August 21. At that time, four months' rent was paid, thinking that the case was closed. Unexpectedly, on September 6, the rent collector suddenly came with many bailiffs to seal up No. 40. All the tenants were panicked. On September 8, the bailiffs came again and continued to seal up No. 27. The tenant had completely paid off the four months of rent owed when the execution court was opened on August 21. When the bailiff was shown the rent receipt, he left angrily. Unexpectedly, on the 10th, the landlord led the bailiffs and a large number of Chinese and Western police officers to seal it up again. When the tenants asked what was going on, they were aggressive and beat them without asking the reason. They even smashed the manure buckets. One Western police officer was contaminated with manure. In addition to beating seven men and women and sending them to the court for injury verification, they also arbitrarily arrested several men and women. At this time, Hu Laisheng, a tenant in this lane, saw that the order was chaotic and rushed to report to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The police station did not send officers to investigate, but detained Hu Laisheng and released him at 6:00 p.m. This situation is really due to the collusion between the landlord and the police station to oppress the tenants. We specially request your association to grant assistance and forward a letter to negotiate in order to calm the public anger. According to this, it is the judiciary's business to pursue rent arrears, and the police station does not need to interfere too much. It can only exercise its functions and be responsible for persuasion. How can it help the rent collector of the foreign firm Taili Company to threaten and oppress and beat many tenants? The police station is an agency for maintaining public order and is responsible for protection. Regardless of the landlord and the tenant, they are all taxpayers. Neither party should be biased. Now that the police station has helped the evildoers and this unfortunate event has occurred, the police station should be fully responsible for compensating all losses and punishing the police officers who used force in order to warn the future and maintain the people's peace. It is appropriate to record a letter to inform you, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, which is convenient for the public." Sincerely, the Public Works Bureau, Public Concession, this time the Director-General,</p>
<p>Yang Guangsheng</p>
<p>Appointed as Special Commissioner for Diplomatic Inspection in Five Provinces</p>
<p>Will Go to Beijing Soon to Meet Wang and Ask for Instructions</p>
<p>Yang Guangsheng, former Special Commissioner for European Inspection and Consul-General in London, has recently been appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Special Commissioner for Diplomatic Inspection in the five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. After receiving the order, Mr. Yang is preparing to go to Beijing soon to ask Foreign Minister Wang for instructions, and then go to Wuhan to take office.</p>
<p>The United States, Australia, and Cuba</p>
<p>Need Our Country's Painting Brushes and Other Products</p>
<p>Those Who Wish to Operate Can Contact the Trade Bureau</p>
<p>According to the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, the United States needs our country's art painting brushes, Australia needs our country's seaweed, and Cuba needs our country's silk ribbons and sweatbands. Those who wish to operate can go to the bureau to contact sales.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>The writing brush is a special product of the East, and our country is the best. It is suitable for both calligraphy and painting. Now there are also painting brushes in Europe and the United States, but they are not as exquisite as those in our country. The Ge Lai Sai Company of Diqu Luotuocheng, United States, needs Chinese art painting brushes. Manufacturers can send their product catalogs and price lists to the bureau so that they can inform the company to purchase them.</p>
<p>Australia</p>
<p>Seaweed is an aquatic plant that grows in clusters on the seashore and is a raw material for weaving mats. Now the British Commercial Commissioner has sent a letter stating that a certain company in Victoria City, Han Zhou, needs this kind of goods. Chinese seaweed merchants who wish to sell abroad can ask the bureau to introduce them.</p>
<p>Cuba</p>
<p>The manufacture of straw and tweed hats is the most progressive industry in our country in recent years. The silk ribbons outside the hats and the sweatbands inside the hats are also produced accordingly. The Bai Kun Company of Cuba has sent a letter requesting these items. Manufacturers can contact the bureau.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, chairman of the Relief Committee, asked the Executive Yuan for two months' leave due to increased insomnia and went to Lushan for recuperation. Now, because reports of disasters from all sides are pouring in like snowflakes, he had to go down the mountain early. On the 9th, he took the China Merchants Bureau's Jiang'an ship from Jiujiang and arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Huang Hanzhi, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Bodu, and dozens of his relatives and friends went to the wharf to welcome him. After landing, Mr. Xu shook hands with the welcomers one by one and then returned to his private residence on Father Luo Road to rest. In the afternoon, he went to the Relief Committee's Shanghai office to work. It is reported that Mr. Xu will go to Beijing in the coming days to attend a meeting of the Relief Committee after slightly processing the important documents.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Please Allow the People's Letter Bureau to Close in Installments</p>
<p>Explaining Four Reasons</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled Chairman Chiang in Nanchang yesterday: The case is based on the joint letter from Hua Yunjin, Wu Yunyu, Ren Shiting, Wang Wenjiang, Wang Tongren, and Yin Yuantong, representatives of the People's Letter Bureau, stating that they were ordered by the ministry to stop business by the end of this year. The previous Mongolian Council spoke out righteously and appealed on behalf of the situation. Although it was not approved, the private gratitude of the industry has been engraved in our hearts. Now that the deadline is approaching, the lives of tens of thousands of people are at stake. We have to make the final request, and we respectfully present it in detail: It has been more than 100 years since the People's Letter Bureau had a history, and it can be seen everywhere in big cities and remote and poor villages. There are tens of thousands of threads involved. Is it possible to complete the closure in a few months? This is one. Most of the employees in various places are old and hard laborers, totaling no less than 30,000 to 40,000 people. The livelihood is the most urgent and important issue. Once unemployed, they will inevitably become starving people. This is two. Recently, commerce and industry have declined, and this is true throughout the country. This year's drought is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. The people in the industry are a combination of farmers, businessmen, and workers. At this moment of desperation, they are desperate everywhere. Does the country care about the lives of the people for the unification of the postal service? Is the first Prime Minister's principle of people's livelihood suitable? This is three. Chambers of commerce and public institutions in various places have a great need for the industry, so they have consistently maintained it throughout history. The facts are obvious, and the general small industrialists and businessmen are particularly closely related because of the convenience of mailing. This is four. In short, national policies and people's lives must be planned and taken care of at the same time in order to be fair. Therefore, the only plan for today is to set a five-year deadline, and the industry will issue a certificate to gradually close down, which can slightly alleviate its difficulties, and the effect of the country's forty years of postal unification is also a matter of time. For this reason, without fear of offending, we express our feelings in detail. We respectfully request your council to take into consideration the difficulties and the imminent danger of life in the industry and grant the right to truthfully submit it to Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, so that the Ministry of Communications will be ordered to extend the time for five years, so as to facilitate the closure. The representatives said that the case was based on the letter from the representatives in April of this year, which stated that the People's Letter Bureau is an affiliated agency of the postal service and has a subsidiary effect. For example, ships sailing in places where boats are not prohibited, and long-distance buses are also allowed to be set up near the tracks. If the order is limited to stop the office, then the society will add more than 50,000 unemployed people, and I am afraid there is no good solution, etc., and the Electricity Department has been informed to comply with the deadline for the end of the business of the People's Letter Bureau, which has been approved. According to the follow-up statement, the representatives are quite aware of respecting national laws and regulations, but the business of more than 100 years and the livelihood of more than 10,000 people are at stake. Once the order is suddenly stopped, not only in remote areas where the postal service has not yet been established, but the traffic will be affected, and the people in the industry will be unemployed at the same time, and it will not be possible to find another industry in a day or two, and the relationship is not shallow. Therefore, for the sake of planning and consideration, the plan to set five years and the association to issue a certificate to close down year by year seems to be in line with the purpose of unifying the postal service.</p>

<p>Securities</p>

Unfavorable factors included: (1) activity remained undiminished when prices fell; (2) the low selling price of seats on the stock exchange was disappointing because the market situation failed to expand. Today, a seat was sold for $76,000, a decrease of $2,000 compared to the last sale. When the securities market opened this morning, the situation was still active, with slight variations, but the trend was mostly downward.

<h3 id="e5">Reducing Railway Freight Rates and Developing the Rural Economy (8) Wu Shaozeng <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The deep relationship between our country's agricultural products and the people's livelihood, and the sharp competition with foreign goods, are probably ten or a hundred times greater than the competition between Boston's leather shoes and California's oranges. Shouldn't we consider the situation and adopt the same uniform freight rate? In summary, its benefits can be listed as follows: (1) Merchants have a clear and precise understanding of the uniform freight rate for each type of agricultural product. They can easily calculate how much freight to pay for transporting a certain amount of goods. They will be happy to be close to the railway, and our staff will be able to calculate easily and fill out cargo receipts or bills of lading quickly, further increasing merchants' trust. (2) After the implementation of this uniform freight rate, if each type of agricultural product cannot obtain a good price in the near area, merchants will not hesitate to transport it to distant places to seek greater profits. For example, rice from Sichuan can be transported to Zhengzhou in Henan, and then transported to Hankou in the near area, or to cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the far area. There will be no impact on costs, and it will be a solution to balance supply and demand, and prices will not rise or fall excessively. Both the rural areas and the general public will benefit. (3) Domestic agricultural products can be mutually beneficial. Unless absolutely necessary, various regions will not tend to sell foreign goods, so the quantity of foreign imports can be reduced invisibly, and the position of domestic products will not be invaded. (4) The planting of agricultural products has a close relationship with the quality of the land. As the saying goes, "Oranges turn into trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River." Also, wet land is suitable for rice, and dry land is suitable for wheat, cotton, or fruit, each having its own suitability. The reason why local products cannot be fully developed is mostly because the products are not profitable. If they can be transported to distant places to seek a good price, farmers will inevitably rush to do so, and they will never leave fields uncultivated. For example, the cotton in Chang'an and Weinan counties in Shaanxi, the oranges in Sichuan, and the peaches in Longhua in Shanghai and Taicang can all reach thousands of miles away. When goods are used to their fullest extent and land is used to its fullest advantage, the ideal of total mobilization of production can be expected to be realized. (5) A uniform freight rate will give agricultural products equal competitive opportunities, regardless of distance. Then, success or failure will not depend on the amount of transportation costs, but on the weight of the costs themselves and the quality. To reduce costs and improve quality, it is inevitable to seek improvements in planting and management methods in order to win the market. Farmers with low levels of knowledge may not be able to understand this, but it is still one of the effects of a uniform freight rate. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Please answer the following questions: (1) The change from quantity to quality must be expressed in the form of a sudden change, but conversely, does every change lead to a change in quality? (2) If you press a glass sheet with your hand and gradually increase the pressure, the glass sheet will inevitably be crushed into fragments. This shows that when the change in quantity (increased pressure) reaches a certain level, a sudden change occurs (the glass sheet is crushed). But here, the quality of the broken glass sheet is still the same as the original glass sheet. How do you explain this? (3) Can the phenomena of iron rusting and a table decaying day by day in the air be explained by sudden changes? (4) The development or change of all things is due to the struggle of opposing elements within the things themselves. The changes in the two objects mentioned in 3 seem to be entirely due to external forces, rather than internal contradictions. What is the reason for this? (5) The New Philosophical Dictionary has the following explanation of chance: "Chance is the external manifestation of necessity; chance occurs at the intersection of two or more regular processes." Please give an example to explain it! I feel that these questions need to be answered publicly. What do you say? —From Wang Dezhao</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Ghosts Carry a Cart of Distant Guests from Guanzhong; A Poor Family Hangs a Qin Man at the Ferry</p>
<p>Here, the car drove onto another ferry on two springboards, and everyone followed. A bent piece of wood was suspended high on the stern of the boat as a rudder, and an old man held it. In addition, three people, each holding a curved piece of wood, walked back and forth on the three-foot-long stern to push the boat. In addition, there were two people, stripped naked, jumping in the water to help the boat head forward. The two people sometimes got on the boat and faced the crowd, but they didn't mind. Secretary Chang smiled and said: This is the Wei River, where Jiang Ziya fished. On the opposite bank, there is a wooden archway with the words "Ancient Ferry of Xianyang" written on it. Cheng Zhiqian laughed and said: I think this ferry, from the time of Emperor Qin Shi Huang to the present, may still maintain that style. It is worthy of the word "ancient." It is interesting to think that the new paddle has to rely on the extremely old one to take the car across the river. Everyone laughed. People were talking and laughing on the boat, looking at the ancient city of Xianyang and the ancient water of the Wei River, looking at the endless plains on both sides, but the sun, which is timeless, shone on them, which also made people feel a sense of emotion. The ferry took forty minutes to cross the water and reach the other shore. The car landed on the shore, went around the north side of Xianyang, and ran north towards the half-cornered city. It was slowly reaching the plateau here. Looking ahead, I only felt that the flat ground was far away and high, and several large mounds were rising in the middle of the plain. According to Secretary Chang, those were all ancient tombs since the Zhou and Han dynasties. There was not a single tree or even a blade of grass in front of the tombs. Cheng Zhiqian couldn't help but sigh: Don't say that Qin had no people, heaven really did it, what can be said? Secretary Chang was from this province, and he sympathized with the people of Shaanxi when he heard this. Moreover, he used set phrases, which were very complete. He cupped his hands and said: I thank you for the people of Shaanxi here. Cheng Zhiqian said: It's not that I'm flattering the people of Shaanxi, I think of the power of nature, which is not easy to resist, and I feel even more that the people of Qin were energetic before. How could they take this place as a base and annex the six boxes? (17)</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Piao Miao Records of Royal Incense <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>These figures may be the figures in various old novels of ancient China and the story paintings hanging elsewhere, reborn and come to pay their respects to our Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>Although such an elaborate arrangement has been neatly displayed in front of the Empress Dowager, it is still unknown whether the Empress Dowager has found it satisfactory in her heart! I think she must be twelve points clear about the true intentions of these officials coming to greet her this time! Because she also knows that the officials in Tianjin and its surrounding areas will never be better than those in other places; they generally spent money or used other relationships—such as kinship, nepotism, etc.—to obtain these lucrative positions. They have no learning and no talent, and they are truly useless to the country and the people. But they do have a brain that is very good at flattery, so they also regard greeting the Empress Dowager as an indispensable means to preserve their jobs and consolidate their positions; some even harbor the extravagant hope of taking this opportunity to obtain some unexpected benefits. In short, in their group, there is simply no one who has come sincerely to greet the Empress Dowager! They all have strong selfish intentions and are secretly planning something, even Yuan Shikai himself is no exception!</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Yuan Shikai, I couldn't help but feel a strange feeling, which immediately stopped my mind in a state of contemplation, and I just stared at him blankly. - This character is the first president of the Republic of China after the success of the Xinhai Revolution. At that time, he also knelt respectfully on the platform in Tianjin to greet the Empress Dowager. Who would have thought that he would have such accomplishments in the future? To be honest, he himself never dreamed of it—I looked at him as if I were examining a monster that I had heard of for a long time but had never met; while recalling the various events of the past, that is, the various events that made him famous.

<h3 id="e9">Zeng Zigu Could Not Write Poetry <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Binghe</p>
<p>Yongchuang Small Pieces records five things that Yuan Cai regretted in his life: one, he hated fish with too many bones; two, he hated kumquats for being too sour; three, he hated water shield for being cold; four, he hated crabapple for having no fragrance; five, he hated that Zeng Zigu could not write poetry. As for whether Zeng Zigu could write poetry or not? Unfortunately, I have not read his complete works. However, Zhang Qiyun's "History of West Lake Scenery" (see the "West Lake Exposition" issue of the Oriental Magazine) contains Zigu's poem "Cooling off at West Lake":</p>
<p>"Ask where to avoid the heat, ten acres of West Lake shine brightly; fish play, a punt fills with waves, birds sing, thousands of trees form green shade.</p>
<p>The rainbow waist faintly emerges from the pine bridge, the ornate bow of the painted boat is towering; most joyous is the cool breeze and good moon in the evening, listening to the sound of the spring in the fragrance of purple lotus."</p>
<p>Perhaps Zigu was not unable to write poetry, but only not skillful.</p>
<p>Huang Tingjian said: "Reading should be pure, not broad." This can be said to be the key to reading. Zigu's conciseness of writing and Su Dongpo's unrestrainedness each have their own merits. However, because his talent is not as good as Dongpo's, his poems and lyrics are not as outstanding as Dongpo's. Only in this way can he use his strengths and hide his weaknesses. Unlike today's people who sometimes write mediocre old poems and sometimes write "sister brother" new poems to show off their erudition and versatility.</p>
<p>Today's people are not only like this when writing articles, poems, and lyrics, but there are also many people who study agriculture and mining yesterday, chemistry today, politics tomorrow, and military affairs the day after tomorrow, almost nothing they have not dabbled in. In fact, they have achieved nothing. Witty people call them "omnipotent doctors." However, compared to Zigu, who spent his life studying articles and was able to be among the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, it is impossible not to have the feeling that "ancient and modern people are often incomparable."</p>
<p>Finally, I conclude my argument by saying: In China's current state of lacking specialized talents, I hope that we would rather have one less omnipotent doctor and one more Zeng Zigu who is good at reading.</p>

<p>Men often hope that every woman who has nothing to do with them is open-minded, which can make it easier for him to approach. But at the same time, they strictly supervise their wives, and even girlfriends are not allowed to have too close relationships.</p>
<p>People are living with expectations. If the things they expect are gone, what kind of life will it be? (Zhen)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Anecdotes of Strange Writings <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Mei Xuejun's article about losing several pounds after taking the entrance exams for Tsinghua, Jiaotong, and Zhejiang Universities three times, which made me feel infinite sympathy.</p>
<p>In such hot weather, being stuck in the examination hall and undergoing difficult exams one after another is really not a "business," and the sharp decrease in weight is indeed a normal phenomenon!</p>
<p>However, the universities have accumulated thousands of exam papers, and the people who are grading them really cannot prevent their headaches, but their weight is said to be unaffected, because there is a lot of information in the exam papers that is enough to make them laugh. Laughter is generally considered beneficial to the body and mind!</p>
<p>This batch of "laughing materials" can be found in exam papers for mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, geography, and other subjects, but its quality is far inferior to the richness of the Chinese exam papers. It is laugh-out-loud worthy that Chinese people can contribute so much "laughing material" when taking Chinese exams!</p>
<p>For example, someone translates the classical Chinese phrase "尸位素餐 (occupying a position without doing any work)" into the colloquial phrase "a plate of vegetarian dishes is offered on the table in front of a corpse," which can be called "a young woman offering yellow silk"! It is said that the person grading the Chinese exam papers originally ate vegetarian food in the summer, but after seeing this exam paper, his appetite was greatly increased, and he reluctantly ate several chopsticks of fatty meat.</p>
<p>One of the Chinese exam questions at a certain private university was "...list the names of the Thirteen Classics..." A certain student wrote "Heaven Classic, Earth Classic, Water Classic, Fire Classic... Nervous Classic..." not enough for the number thirteen. However, he did not write down "Menstrual Classic," so this person clearly lacks knowledge!</p>
<p>There is also a colloquial translation of "Zhuang Bao Meets Mencius." One of the sentences in the original text is "王之好樂，則齊國其庶幾乎 (If the king loves pleasure, then the state of Qi will be almost prosperous)," and the author wrote "If the king likes to seek happiness like this, the state of Qi is really terrible!" This can be called a strange argument. However, leaving aside Mencius's original text, this colloquial translation cannot be said to be incomprehensible, and once tasted, a faint feeling of "looking at the troubled times with sadness and worrying about national affairs" is revealed between the teeth. The author is probably also a person with a heart! A laugh.</p>

<p>— (Chen Xiaoyin)</p>
<p>When it comes to eating, Kunshan's duck is of course the most famous.</p>
<p>According to statistics, there are more than a dozen noodle restaurants in Kunshan. Once summer passes, the new ducks are on the market, and all of them have thriving business and are often full of customers, which shows the popularity of Kunshan duck noodles.</p>
<p>Last year, Chairman Lin of the National Government came to Kunshan and ate it once at the Central Restaurant on Xingxue Road because he admired the deliciousness of Kunshan duck noodles. Therefore, Kunshan's duck noodles attracted the attention of diners.</p>
<p>Moreover, the price of eating is also expensive. One piece of duck only sells for twelve copper coins, and a bowl of noodles only costs twenty-six copper coins, so you can have a full meal. If you want to eat a few more pieces of duck, then you may as well ask him to add a few pieces. If you can't finish eating, they will calculate the number accordingly, and they are very accommodating. This kind of cheap and good food is really the most economical.</p>

<h3 id="e14">A WEEKLY BEAUTIFICATION SCHEDULE <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Students in school have a schedule so they can systematically gain knowledge. We at home should also set a schedule for decoration and beauty so that we can systematically achieve the desired effect. Recently, a foreign beautification expert published a weekly beautification schedule, which is very well organized. I will now translate it and offer it to readers for reference. His arrangement is as follows: Monday, perform facial and neck massages. Tuesday, after bathing, perform a full-body olive oil massage. Wednesday, manicure. Thursday, treat corns (if you don't have corns, you may change it to other treatments, such as trimming toenails). Friday, perform scalp massage and washing (this washing can only be done once every two weeks, unless your hair is particularly oily, then you can wash it once a week). Saturday, groom hair. Sunday, manicure. According to this expert, if we strictly adhere to his set beautification schedule and continue to practice it, then our appearance will surely improve day by day and become more beautiful every day.</p>
<p>The above beautification schedule, if not briefly explained, is not enough to convince people. Therefore, this expert also attached an outline, which roughly says: Have you ever felt unusually happy and comfortable when you came out of the bathtub after taking a bath at night, or when you came back from outdoor exercise? Your face is flushed and red, your muscles feel relaxed, and your nerves seem to be inhibited. You rush into your bedroom and look in the mirror, then you will be greatly disappointed. Originally, you wanted to see crystal clear and bright eyes, flawless skin, and a lively and vibrant appearance, but you only see an unclear and dull face, and fluffy hair; but this body is still the beautiful body that people praise every day. Why is this? It's because of the lack of beautification.</p>
<p>Clothes: Have you ever thought about things that can achieve the above goals? Clothes, of course, are very important. You may wish to try preparing two days of accessories, but do not make them repeat. Your handbag must be exquisite and beautiful, and clean. Many women are very unsuccessful, either dressing sloppily or carrying fat handbags, because there are too many things in the bag, and even the mouth of the bag is open, revealing a layer of dirty, rough lining. This is inelegant. Those who pursue beauty will also study even these small things. If you know how to study small things' handbags, then you will not fail to study large things' clothes.</p>
<p>Hands: Now we are going to talk about beauty treatments that people unanimously praise. From your point of view, when a woman studies beauty, what is the easiest thing to ignore? Personally, I would put "hands" first. Whether you are doing household chores, washing children's clothes, or just washing your hands after buying something from outside, you should always use a good quality soap. Then, after the skin is completely dry, use a reliable hand lotion, but do not rub it too heavily. Skin cream and cleansing cream, used to rub on the hands, have as many benefits as those applied to the face.</p>
<p>Face: Now many people know to be careful about the skin of the face, and therefore have gained quite correct beauty techniques through experience; but have you ever thought about your facial expressions, smiles? Go to your mirror and make a smile, or one day when you are laughing, go to the mirror and take a look. Is the result what you imagined? Probably not. Then try again, and see which result you think is the most satisfactory. In any case, be very honest and don't be afraid to find your own weaknesses, or ask a friend to help you, and make up your mind to improve all the weaknesses. And check the drawer where you put your decorations and beauty products, and throw away anything that is useless. Some creams, pastes, and powders may not be suitable for your skin; some perfumes may not be suitable for your personality; then send them back to where they came from!</p>
<p>Sisters, you can beautify as much as you like, but all the things needed for beautification must be domestic products. If you abuse imported goods, then it is better not to beautify, even if you have messy hair and rough clothes, it doesn't matter. —Editor—</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Education Supervises Progress</p>
<p>Shanghai, Wuxi, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuhan Establish Labor Education Experiment Zones</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Industry and Education jointly promulgated the Outline of the Implementation Measures for Labor Education last year, in order to promote the development of the cause, the two ministries jointly formed a Labor Education Design Committee to discuss the implementation. The committee held a meeting in the spring of this year and decided to establish labor education experiment zones in Shanghai, Wuxi, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuhan. The main purpose is to improve workers' knowledge, skills, and work efficiency, and to seek improvement in workers' lives. This labor education is divided into three types: literacy training, civic training, and vocational tutoring. After the establishment of the experiment zones, it will be implemented separately according to the educational level of the workers in the shortest possible time. All laborers from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors should receive these three types of training. The local education administrative organs will urge the local agricultural, industrial, commercial, and other industrial factories, companies, and shops to be responsible for the completion. Factories, companies, and shops employing more than 50 and less than 200 workers should set up labor schools or labor classes. Those with less than 50 people are also required to establish joint establishment methods. Since the decision to establish experiment zones in Shanghai, Wuxi, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuhan, the Ministry of Industry and Education have separately consulted the provincial and municipal governments or education departments of each place last month, hoping to make preparations as soon as possible. It is now heard that the two ministries, in order to supervise the early establishment of the Labor Education Experiment Zone, plan to send special commissioners to the five designated places to guide and supervise, so that the five places in Shanghai, Wuxi, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuhan will first establish the Labor Education Experiment Zone, and then gradually promote it throughout the country to supplement the inadequacy of social education.</p>
<p>Danish Agriculture</p>
<p>Experts Lecture in Wuxi</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Dr. Marek, the president of the Danish International People's College, came to China to visit the people's education and rural construction work in Wuxi, Zou Ping, Ding County and other places. At that time, Dr. Marek, in view of the agricultural expertise related to the improvement of rural areas in Denmark, could not be fully introduced to China, so he suggested introducing one or two Danish agricultural experts to China to lecture. It is now learned that this suggestion has long been approved by the National Central University and the Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute in Wuxi, and the two professors introduced by Dr. Marek, Andorsen and Ealslev, have already arrived at the Wuxi Education Institute. Both of them are professors at the Danish Askov People's High School (the earliest of the Danish folk schools). Mr. Anderson is a professor of agriculture, and Mr. Beersler is a professor of history education. This week, they will give lectures at the college on the development of Danish folk high schools and the agricultural improvement process. All teachers and students of the college will attend the lectures and have discussions to discuss the actual problems in rural China, and visit and guide the various practical works of the college. Next week, the two will go to Nanjing to accept the invitation of China University to lecture, and then go to Tianjin, Zou Ping, Ding County and other places to inspect. It is expected that they will have to rush back to Denmark within the year in order to participate in the opening ceremony of the Danish folk school in winter.</p>
<p>Application Period Extended for European Mechanical Students</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The Ministry of Education has extended the application period for publicly funded mechanical engineering students studying in Europe to the 30th of this month, and ordered that the physical examination be conducted from October 1st and the examination be conducted for three days. The age limit for applicants has also been extended to within 32 years old.</p>

<p>China Cooperative Society</p>
<p>Establishes Cooperative Honor Tripod</p>
<p>Commending Comrades Who Have Made the Most Contributions to Cooperation</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Guofu Is Designated as the Recipient of the Tripod This Year</p>
<p>The executive committee members of the China Cooperative Society, Shou Miancheng, Wang Shiying, Chen Zhongming, Hou Houpei, He Yushu, and Tong Yumin, believe that the society is an academic organization and should encourage the cooperative cause in various ways in order to promote the purpose of the cause. They specially drafted measures for establishing a cooperative honor tripod and submitted it to the 10th Standing Committee meeting held the day before yesterday (9th) for discussion. It was resolved to amend and pass it, and it was also resolved that the recipient of the tripod this year should be decided by the Executive Committee itself due to the fact that the opening date of the 4th Congress was approaching. It was agreed that the driving force behind the revival of the cooperative movement in China was due to the greatest credit of Chen Guofu, the Central Committee member and current chairman of Jiangsu Province. His facilities for the cooperative cause at ordinary times are especially able to discern the needs of the environment and indicate the path that should be taken. Such as the recently announced Cooperative Law by the National Government, which is based on the principles of the Cooperative Law drafted by Mr. Chen and passed by the Central Government. Based on the contribution to the entire cooperative movement in China, it is rare among comrades. The candidate for the tripod this year was decided to be Mr. Chen. A grand award ceremony will be held on the opening day of the 4th Congress. The details of the measures are extracted as follows: (Measures for the Establishment of the Cooperative Honor Tripod by the China Cooperative Society) 1. This society has specially established a large silver tripod to commend cooperative comrades, named Cooperative Honor Tripod. 2. The Cooperative Honor Tripod is awarded to comrades who have made the most contributions to cooperative academics and cooperative undertakings. It is held once a year or once a year. 3. The candidates for the tripod should be nominated by the Executive Committee three months before the convening of the general meeting of members to form a committee to nominate the Cooperative Honor Tripod. The committee will nominate three candidates, with their opinions, and send them to the Executive Committee for decision. 4. The Cooperative Honor Tripod will be preserved in the society for a long time. The name of the recipient should be engraved in the center of the tripod. Another tripod certificate will be awarded to the recipient for safekeeping and commemoration. 5. A ceremony should be held for the award of the tripod. The recipient must attend in person. The opening day of the general meeting of members is the date of the tripod award ceremony. 6. The recipient of the tripod is not limited to members of this society, but must be a national citizen.</p>
<p>The History of the Development of Education in Shandong in the Past Four Years</p>
<p>A Detailed Report by He Siyuan</p>
<p>Jinan Communication, September 9th is the fourth anniversary of the third session of the Shandong Provincial Government. The Provincial Government held a commemorative meeting at the Jinde Society to report on the past and encourage the future. At the commemorative meeting, the main political affairs of civil administration, construction, finance, and education were all detailed. Among them, the report by He Siyuan, the director of the Education Department, was the most accurate and concise, from the establishment of the current provincial government in September of the 19th year to the present in the 23rd year. In addition to the details of the commemorative meeting that have been recorded in another draft, the following is an excerpt of He Siyuan's report: Before September of the 19th year, the number of students in the province was 695,026 in middle schools, senior primary schools, and junior primary schools. Now in September of the 23rd year, the number of students in middle schools, senior primary schools, and junior primary schools in the province is 1,259,405. Calculated for four years and 1,460 days, there is an increase of 555,000 people, an average increase of 380 students per day. After the 19th year, the local area was initially stable, and children were able to enter school. There was an increase in the first three years, but since last year, the price of grain was low and hurting farmers, and the rural economy was declining, there was not much increase. According to the survey, there are 4,260,000 school-age children in the province, and only 27% are in school. Many children cannot get the opportunity to receive education, which is a major social problem. In order to meet the actual needs, we should strive to expand compulsory education. However, expanding compulsory education is difficult to find teachers. According to statistics, there are 45,223 teachers in the province, an average of one teacher teaching 286 students. Therefore, the Education Department has been working hard to train teachers. There are now seven provincial normal schools, four joint normal schools, and eleven county normal schools in the province, and they are continuing to expand. The provincial education fund is now 3.05 million yuan, and the county local education fund is 6,969,000 yuan, totaling 10.019 million yuan. On average, each person in the province bears an education fee of 2.74 cents per year. The provincial education fund was 2,727,000 yuan for the whole year in September of the 19th year, and to the present in September of the 23rd year, it is 3.05 million yuan. Compared with the past four years, it has increased by 333,000 yuan, an increase of 13% (also an increase in the first three years, and no increase in the last year due to the rural economic decline and budget cuts). The county education fund was 3,785,000 yuan for the whole year in September of the 19th year, and to the present in September of the 23rd year, it is 4,595,000 yuan for the whole year (there are also 2.4 million yuan for district and village education funds). Over the past four years, it has increased by 810,000 yuan, an increase of 18% (also an increase in the first three years and no increase in the last year). The future education policy will be changed from seeking official education to seeking livelihood education. Middle schools will strictly implement the joint examination. Four graduation joint examinations have been held before, all of which are joint examinations, and personnel are sent to conduct spot checks at any time to improve the level of students, and efforts are made to train them. Military training is also particularly serious. The first session will be held this year, and it will be held every year thereafter.</p>
<p>China University</p>
<p>Yunnan Inspection Team Postpones Departure</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The Yunnan Geographical Inspection Team of China University was originally scheduled to depart from Beijing on the 11th, but the departure has been postponed for several days due to the incomplete passport procedures.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Universities Resolves</p>
<p>Inconvenient to Collect Education Movie Fees on Behalf</p>
<p>Shanghai Branch of the Education Movie Association Believes There Is a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Jiaotong, Jinan and Other Schools Have Already Collected on Behalf by Name</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Branch of the China Education Movie Association was approved by the Ministry of Education to collect education movie fees from public and private primary and secondary schools in this city this semester to serve as a fund to fully develop the national education movie cause, the schools have been collecting on behalf of the association. However, at the first executive committee meeting of the Shanghai University Federation in the 23rd year, the federation had many difficulties in handling the matter of the association's request to collect one yuan from students on behalf of the universities, and resolved that it was inconvenient to collect on behalf of the association. Yesterday, the Shanghai News reporter inquired about the opinion of the Education Movie Association on this matter. According to the person in charge of the association, since the association was ordered to request the schools to collect education movie fees on behalf of the association, universities such as National Jiaotong University and National Jinan University, in view of the fact that education movies can indeed assist in the inadequacy of book education, have promoted cooperation and that it is their duty to do so. The schools have included the education movie fee of one yuan and the badge deposit of one cent on the tuition bill of the students, and they will notify the association to send personnel to collect them after the collection is completed. As for the inconvenience of the University Federation to collect on behalf of the association, it is understood that the misunderstanding is that the fee is not caused by the order of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>China Vocational Education Society</p>
<p>Board of Directors of the Personnel Management Society</p>
<p>Resolves to Hold Personnel Management Training Institute</p>
<p>The Personnel Management Society, initiated and organized by the China Vocational Education Society, has been established for nearly five months. It has spared no effort in researching and improving personnel management issues. Various tasks are extremely tense. The fifth board of directors meeting was held yesterday, and it was decided to hold a personnel management training institute. He Qingru was appointed as the director, Zhang Suomin as the director of education, and Yang Chonggao as the director of affairs. The institute will recruit personnel from various factories and agencies in the city who handle personnel management duties, and those who are interested in personnel management, to impart personnel management knowledge to facilitate further research. It is scheduled to start on October 7th and lecture once every Sunday morning from 10:00 to 11:00, limited to three months. The registration period is from now until October 6th. The lecturers are decided to be He Qingru, Zhang Suomin, Tu Zheyin, Gu Bingyuan, Pan Yangyao, Zhang Yunyun, and Cheng Shouzhong. In addition, in order to make foreigners understand, the society plans to compile and print the organization and work of the Personnel Management Society for publicity, and also appointed Tu Gongyin and Wu Zongwen to be responsible for sorting out the materials. The lecture, investigation, and publication matters are also planned and started.</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Receive the New Life Covenant</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Notified Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed all primary and secondary schools: It is found that the bureau previously issued the Outline of the Shanghai Primary and Secondary Schools Implementing the New Life Method, and notified all schools to follow the implementation. Now it is found that the New Life Covenant printed and sent by the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association is practical and effective. All students above the middle grade of primary schools should especially have one copy per person to achieve significant results. It is now learned that the association still has 30,000 books in stock. It is urgent that all schools prepare a letter with a seal, stating the quantity, and send personnel to the association to receive them in order to distribute them and promote them widely. This order.</p>
<p>After Uniform Uniforms for Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>Various Factories and Stores Compete to Send Uniform Samples</p>
<p>After the Municipal Education Bureau promulgated the uniform uniform measures for primary and secondary school students in this city, various factories and stores went to the bureau to obtain the measures and rushed to make uniform samples for submission to the bureau for review. However, the samples must absolutely use domestic materials (such as Zhanghua Shenxin factories' wool or cotton cloth). In addition to estimating the price of each set, the name of the material, the place of origin, the factory number, and the raw material size and price (such as the width of each piece, the length, the number of sets that can be tailored from each piece, etc.) should be recorded in detail for review. It is heard that various factories and stores have done so.</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Requests the Central Government</p>
<p>To Seek a Way Out for University Graduates</p>
<p>Send to Bandit Areas to Engage in Education and Politics</p>
<p>Send to the Northwest to Develop and Develop the Border Areas</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city believes that the social depression has become more and more serious in recent years, resulting in the phenomenon that graduates of universities in various provinces have almost lost their jobs after graduation, while all things in the border areas need to be constructed, but there is a sigh of lack of talent. Therefore, it has specially submitted two suggestions to the Central Government to train the students for a short period of time in advance: (1) Send them to bandit areas to engage in education and political work. (2) Send them to the Northwest to engage in border construction. This kind of work is an urgent matter today. If it can be adopted, the national economy and people's livelihood will be deeply relied upon.</p>
<p>Attending the Pan-Pacific Women's Association</p>
<p>Our Country's Representatives Return to Shanghai After Completing Their Work</p>
<p>The Young Women's Christian Association Will Hold a Welcome Meeting Today</p>
<p>Invite Women from All Walks of Life to Participate and Express Condolences</p>
<p>The Third Congress of the Pan-Pacific Women's Association was held in Honolulu last month. The Preparatory Committee of our country had selected Ms. Gao Junshan, Mrs. Jin Longzhang, and Mrs. Luo Jialun to attend and participate, as reported in the previous report. It is now learned that the representatives have sent a telegram to Shanghai, and will take the Japanese Empress Wheel back to China after the meeting. The wheel will arrive at the port today.

Women from all walks of life have been invited to participate, and women from the international cause are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>The Chinese Students Studying in the United States Held a Meeting</p>
<p>On the President Hoover</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Shaoping, the general director of the Global Chinese Students Association, 190 Card Road, received a letter from the first batch of students to the United States this year yesterday, saying that when the Pacific Ocean large mail ship President Hoover left Yokohama, Japan on August 17, the Chinese student group specially convened a meeting. Wang Wang Yukai, Wu Youlin, and Lu Jiqing were elected as the presidium. Those present that day included Consul Chen of China stationed in Mexicali and Consul Wang stationed in Honolulu. All the Chinese students studying in the United States attended, totaling more than 100 people. First, Chairman Wang Yukai delivered an opening speech and reported the following two points: (1) There are photos of Chinese people smoking opium and women with bound feet hanging on the Hoover, which is close to insulting the national system. When negotiating with the shipowner, the photos have been taken down. (2) During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan seized many doors of giant cannons in our country and displayed them at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. This is a great shame for our country. I hope that all the students present will write to friends in the motherland to awaken the people and strive to become stronger. The following two items were then discussed and decided: (1) Compile and print the list of members of the Chinese student group on the President Hoover to facilitate communication and cooperation after returning to the country to be loyal to the party and the country. (2) At the Meridian Amusement Fair, please ask Du Tingxiu and Wu Youlin to represent China and participate in the performance. Finally, Consul Chen, stationed in Mexicali, gave a speech, in which he encouraged young people and pointed out the points to pay attention to when studying in the United States.</p>
<p>German Cultural Circles</p>
<p>Give Our Country a Large Number of Books to Shanghai</p>
<p>The German Consulate Plans to Hold a Public Exhibition at the End of This Month</p>
<p>Will Be Donated to the Oriental Library for Preservation</p>
<p>In order to promote German academics and connect the feelings of the Chinese and German cultural circles, and to deeply communicate the academic ideas of Europe and the United States, the German cultural circles recently purchased a large number of books for our country, including philosophy, social sciences, literature, etc., totaling more than 3,000 volumes, worth tens of thousands of gold or more, and many of them are scientific books that have been out of print. There are also many German ancient books, which are rare in modern times. Therefore, their intangible value cannot be estimated materially. The books were all donated by the Chinese College of Berlin, the German Cultural Relief Society, and the German Oriental Association, three cultural groups. All the books have been transported to Shanghai by German ships, and are now temporarily stored in the warehouses of the Lihua Foreign Company. The German Consulate in this city will represent the groups and formally donate them to the Rejuvenation Committee of the Oriental Library, which is actively reviving the Commercial Press. However, before the transfer, the German Consulate has scheduled to hold a public exhibition of the books in this city at the end of this month, so that our academic circles can learn from them. After the exhibition is over, the books will be handed over to the Oriental Library for display.</p>

<p>Jiangnan Track and Field Team Recruiting New Soldiers</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Track and Field Team was established after the Chinese team's failure at the 8th Far Eastern Games in Japan in 1930. It has been almost five years since then, and the team has achieved remarkable results and maintained strong unity. It is noted that the team's expenses, apart from the 1,150 yuan raised externally for the trip to Tianjin and Beijing in the summer of 1931, have been consistently borne by the directors and team members, without any external fundraising, which is truly commendable. In terms of strength, the team currently has more than 20 members, including Hao Chunde, Cao Yu, Wang Jihuai, Dong Shuzhao, Tao Yingjie, Dong Yinchu, Gong Wanyu, Chen Xingpei, Zhang Jiakui, Jin Zhongkang, Chen Jiayou, Chu Yinghuang, Yang Qingxie, and He Debao. A Nanjing branch team has also been established, making it the only strong track and field team in China. It is reported that the team plans to recruit 20 new members in the near future to expand its operations and train new track and field talents, hoping to train them into rising heroes in the next year or two. The selection method will involve selection committee members observing each person's physical condition and talent during competitions to determine their suitability. Those who are interested in joining the track and field team for training can submit their name, age, place of origin, and the events they wish to participate in, along with their usual performance, to the following addresses before this Friday: Jiangnan Track and Field Team Correspondence Office, No. 6, Meihua Lane, Jubble Plus Road; Dong Shuzhao, Guanghua University; Hao Chunde, Jinan University; Dong Yinchu, Jiaotong University; Yang Qingxie, Fudan University; Chen Xingpei, Daxia University; and the Physical Education Department of Chizhi University.

<p>Table Tennis Friendship Match: Postal Group B Wins over Lianhua</p>
<p>Child Star Li Keng's Performance is Divine</p>
<p>The Group B table tennis team of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union had a friendly match with the Lianhua Film Company yesterday at the Lianhua First Factory. Wang Huizhang served as the referee. The table tennis skills of Huang Shaofen and others from Lianhua were quite remarkable, so the results were excellent. Lianhua was defeated by the Postal Group B by a narrow margin of 3-4. After the match, there was an exhibition match between Lianhua child star Li Keng and Xi Songlu from the Postal Group B. Li Keng is only six years old, and his height is almost the same as the table tennis table. A platform had to be placed on the ground at one end of the table when he served, and he stood on the platform, which was quite amusing. Even when facing Xi Songlu, he was able to cope with ease. In one game, he even fought to a tie several times before the winner was decided, which was even more commendable. The results of yesterday's match are recorded below:</p>

<p>Finance</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Has Turned Calm</p>
<p>Premium Initially Firm but Later Weak</p>
<p>Still Up 6.7 Yuan Compared to Before Suspension</p>
<p>The gold market was not very active yesterday due to stabilizing public sentiment. The foreign exchange market was easing, and the news was unfavorable, resulting in a weak outcome. In the morning, overseas silver markets showed a decrease in London and a flat market in the US. London spot gold rose by 2.5 pence. Foreign exchange was flat. US cotton fell by 22 points. US wheat fell slightly. Stocks fell by $1.54. The Gold Traders Association had already discussed the new settlement price, and trading in October and November remained the same, without any impact. As a result, public sentiment turned calm, and preparatory trading opened at 578 yuan, immediately falling afterward. However, the situation was fluctuating. After opening, the foreign exchange market tightened slightly due to continued buying of US dollars by fellow traders, and public sentiment rose again, causing prices to rise. However, banks' appetite remained saturated, and there were many sellers in the market. A certain speculator, Mr. Wu, aggressively sold, causing prices to fall again. It was known that the HSBC bank's listed price had not changed, and public sentiment was stable. Buyers were also active, so prices struggled around 6 yuan. The Central Bank aggressively opened several hundred spot contracts at 957 yuan, and spot dealers bravely countered, causing prices to rise. However, Reuters reported that after inquiring with the US Treasury Department, the official result was that the Treasury Department denied the rumors that it would ban private banks from importing gold. Although this news had been published in newspapers, the upward trend was blocked as a result. Later, banks' appetite shifted from far-term to near-term, and the overall trend became mediocre. At noon, the situation turned weak as banks aggressively sold again. However, many liquidated their positions, and public sentiment suddenly turned weak in the afternoon. It was rumored that the Ministry of Finance had reiterated that the foreign exchange transactions made by Shanghai's banking industry were legitimate and compliant. As a result, Chinese merchants slightly reduced their intentions to buy long positions, and a selling trend emerged in the gold market, causing prices to fall. However, a report from Mumbai indicated a decrease of one anna, and the Central Bank's continued spot sales allowed prices to recover. Although there was another decline afterward, the second report from Mumbai advised against action and indicated a decrease of one anna, which helped maintain prices after the drop. Here is a summary of the market situation for the day:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 955 yuan, up 9.9 yuan from before the suspension. The goods opening price was 4.8 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4.9375 pence for British pounds and 35.375 yuan for US dollars. Yicheng, Senchang, and Yong sold at 4.5 yuan, while Yuanmao, Yongda, Dafayong, Yuqing, Yongshengmao, Zhengchang, Yuan Yi, Da Changxiang, etc., were all buyers. Chinese merchants actively bought, and the market slightly tightened, rising to 8 yuan. Dafayong, Yongheng, Yiyu, Yicheng, Yifeng, Yongyuanheng, Daxingyong, etc., sold, retreating to 5.2 yuan. Jiaotong sold November at half a yuan. It was learned that HSBC's listed price had not changed. Yuanmao, Yongda, Dadecheng, Yuqingyong, Qingyuanyuan, Changyongheng, Yu Fuyuanyuan, Changyong, etc., took advantage of the low prices to buy, gradually rising to above 6 yuan, but still struggling. Finally, the Central Bank aggressively opened more than 1,000 spot contracts, and spot dealers bravely countered, causing prices to rise to 6.2 yuan. HSBC, Citibank, and Maccarie sold December US dollars at half a yuan, and Tianfeng, Yifeng, and Yongzhaofengchang sold at 5.5 yuan. Citibank bought November US dollars at 4.4375, and Shengda aggressively bought, causing prices to rise again. Hongxing, Yuanxing, etc., also bought, bringing the price to 6.7 yuan. Later, banks aggressively sold October and November US dollars at 4.4375, and supply exceeded demand. Fu'an, Fuyu, Yuqingyong, Yuanchunfuchang, Fuxingyong, and Meng sold, gradually falling to 5.1 yuan. However, Shunmao, Tongfu, and Yuan Yi still bought, and the noon closing price was 955.1 yuan. The goods were sold at 5.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 954.8 yuan, and the goods opened at 4.7 yuan. Sentiment was weak, and the foreign exchange market was also firm. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yuanchun, Daxingyong, Zhaofengchang, and Yuanchangyong all sold. Foreign telegrams reported that the US strike had ended. Huabi came out with October US dollars at half a yuan, falling to 1 yuan. Tongchun, Da Changxiang, Fuchang, Cui Tai, Shunshi, Yuqingyong, etc., took advantage of the low prices to buy. Mumbai fell one anna, rebounding to 2.4 yuan. Hengtai sold, but Tianfeng, Yingfeng, and Heng Shang bought, so the price struggled around 2 yuan. The Central Bank had some spot sales as well. However, sentiment was weak, and there were many who wanted to sell. Hengtai, Daxingyong, Tianfengchun, Yuanyongzhaofengchang sold to 1.1 yuan. Fuchang, Tongchun, Fuxingyong, Yuanxingying, and Fengheng Shang bought. Mumbai fell again, then rebounded to 2.4 yuan. Fu'an and Dadecheng slightly sold off, and then fell to 1.5 yuan. The closing price was 951.8 yuan, and the goods were sold at the same price. After the market closed, Hengxing aggressively bought to settle. It was found that the highest price during the day was 958 yuan, and the lowest price was 951 yuan, a difference of 7 yuan. As a result, although it was lower than the previous day's grey market, it was still up 6.7 yuan compared to the closing price on Saturday of the previous week.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 34.875 yuan for HSBC's US dollar listing price, which corresponded to a gold price of 992 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 40 yuan off, which was not much different from the noon closing price on Saturday of the previous week. The account price for this month was 956 yuan, and for October it was 955 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 956 yuan, and the supplementary water in the afternoon was 953 yuan. The price of red gold was still increased by 11 yuan, listed at 966 yuan. The trading volume in the market was extremely active, mainly because the Tianjin group returned a large number of goods, and arrivals were also abundant. It was estimated that spot dealers Dadecheng, Taikangrun, Yingfengheng, Tongfengheng, and Da Fengheng bought more than 10,000 taels, of which 6,000 taels were used for book transactions, priced at 12.75 yuan. There were also 4,000 taels of newly sold spot, priced at 12 yuan. Spot dealers fiercely competed to sell spot contracts, and the Central Bank aggressively opened more than 1,400 spot contracts. The highest initial batch price in the morning was 957 yuan, and later there was a transaction at 6 yuan. In the afternoon, Yingfeng Heng sold 200 contracts at a price of about 952 yuan to 2.5 yuan.

<p>Banks Show Strong Selling Intent</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Turns Easier Again</p>
<p>US Denies Saying Private Banks Are Banned from Importing</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, London's large contracts, both near and far, decreased by 0.0625, and US banks remained unchanged. London spot gold rose by 2.5 pence. The British pound rose against the US dollar by 0.375, and the US dollar rose against the British pound by 0.25. The British pound rose against the French franc by 9 points, and the US dollar remained unchanged. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4.9375 pence for British pounds and 35.375 yuan for US dollars. Compared with the previous closing price, the British pound was flat and the US dollar eased by 0.25. After opening, the market was flat. Although banks sold, Chinese merchants actively bought, and the market tightened slightly for a time. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, both the British and US dollars were flat. At this time, because the Central Bank aggressively opened spot contracts, the process was stable. Later, banks' appetite to sell remained strong, and public sentiment seemed weak, and the market eased slightly. Public sentiment was even weaker in the afternoon, and the domestic market gradually eased. Although the news that the US strike had ended did not have much impact, Chinese merchants dumped their positions for a time, and the process hardened. Later, although Mumbai repeatedly reported slight decreases, the rumor that the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government reiterated that the foreign exchange transactions made by Shanghai's banking industry and Chinese merchants were legitimate naturally dampened the hopes of Chinese merchants to cover their short positions, and the situation remained loose. The closing price for near-term selling was 1 shilling 5 pence for British pounds and 35.5 yuan for US dollars. Compared with the previous closing price, the British pound eased by 0.0625, and the US dollar strengthened by 0.25. Chinese merchants continued to buy US dollars for about 1.56 million yuan, and also bought shillings. Here is a record of the day's transactions:</p>
<p>The British pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 4.9375 pence. Anda sold to the Central Bank September for 1 shilling 5 pence, HSBC sold November for the same price, Maccarie sold to Huabi October for the same price, Citibank sold to Taiwan September for 5 pence, and Youli sold January for 0.0625. The noon closing price for near-term selling was 1 shilling 4.9375 pence. Later, Huabi sold HSBC spot for 5 pence, and Maccarie bought October for 0.0625. Meifeng bought December for 0.125. The closing selling price ranged from 1 shilling 5 pence to 0.0625, with a buying price increased by 0.0625.</p>
<p>The US dollar opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 35.375 yuan. Mitsui sold November for half a yuan, and Shanghai, Huabi, Jiaotong, and Mitsui sold the same month for 4.4375 and half a yuan. Yuntong sold December for half a yuan, and sold to Huabi October for 4.4375. Mitsui came out with December for 5.625, and Jiaotong sold November for half a yuan. Maccarie and Meifeng bought the same month for the same price, Mitsui sold October for 375, and Mitsui and Zhengjin bought December for 5.625. HSBC, Citibank, and Maccarie sold December for half a yuan and October for 375, Citibank bought November for 4.4375, and the Central Bank sold to HSBC and Anda sold to Shanghai, Maccarie, and HSBC September for 375. Maccarie, Shanghai, and Jiaotong came out with October and November for 4.4375, and Mitsui bought December for 5.625. The noon closing price for near-term selling was 35.375 yuan. Later, Huabi bought November for 5.625 and sold half a yuan. Datong sold HSBC and Maccarie spot for 4.4375, Huabi sold October for half a yuan, and Shanghai and Huabi bought December for 6.875.

The closing selling price was 35.5 yuan or 4.4375 for September and October, 5.625 for November, 6.25 for December, and 6.875 for January, with a buying price increased by 0.0625.</p>
<p>Progress Shown in Silver Dollar Market</p>
<p>The stagnation in the silver dollar market in recent years has reached an extreme. The outflow of cash silver last month caused a temporary tension, which was a special circumstance and not representative. Currently, there is indeed a positive trend in the silver dollar market. The interbank lending rate in the market has actually exceeded one dime, with the morning and afternoon rates both at 1.1 dimes, up one point from the previous day. As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, there is likely to be a further increase. The initial rate for "drawing a line and adding water" was four points, but due to sufficient funds, it was changed to a white line. The demand for silver has not yet reached the peak season, which is also a natural trend. The volume of check transactions was more than 4.0 million in the morning market and more than 300,000 in the afternoon market. The volume of transactions in the small association was more than 400,000. The volume of silver mortgage transactions was more than 700,000 for withdrawals and more than 1.5 million for new loans. For bank settlements, foreign banks settled more than 2.2 million in checks, more than 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and more than 4.2 million in various types of exchange goods and mortgages, with 400,000 going into storage. Chinese banks settled more than 3.1 million in checks, more than 1.3 million in foreign exchange settlements, more than 600,000 in customs duties, and more than 5.3 million in various types of exchange goods and mortgages, with 500,000 going into storage. Japanese banks settled more than 2.9 million in checks, more than 700,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and more than 5.2 million in various types of exchange goods and mortgages, with 600,000 going out of storage. Money shops settled more than 34.4 million in silver public bills, more than 7.2 million in silver line accounts, more than 900,000 in banknote withdrawals, more than 1.5 million in issuances, more than 500,000 in various remittances, more than 600,000 in cash settlements, 300,000 in incoming funds, and 150,000 in outgoing funds. In addition, the total number of exchanges in the city's clearing house was 7,017,131.17 yuan in silver dollars, including 3,548,444.02 yuan in silver dollars and 3,468,687.15 yuan in exchanged silver dollars.</p>
<p>Penny Market Slightly Declines, Copper Coins Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the penny market generally weakened slightly. The price of Jiangnan small silver coins was still 835 yuan in the morning market, but it was reduced to 834 yuan in the afternoon market, a decrease of one yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 6,000 pennies in the morning market and 3,000 pennies in the afternoon market. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was the same in both the morning and afternoon markets at 748.2 yuan, a decrease of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 120,000 pennies in the morning market and 35,000 pennies in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins continued to rise by 2,000 coins compared to the previous day, with a trading volume of 322,000 coins. The trading price was 128,000 yuan, equivalent to 45,216 strings of cash.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>Bond Market Mixed with Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the Shanghai China Securities Exchange listed the interbank lending rate as one point higher, it was unrelated to the market. The short positions on the market's trading floor still had a pressure effect. Large investors were mostly rolling over positions. It was heard that large-scale mortgages were still difficult, and the silver market had not eased. Numbers 4 and 54 on the market were mostly buying, number 46 was rolling over long positions, and the Guangdong group was also selling. Public sentiment still felt doubtful, so the market situation was quite chaotic. It was evident that public sentiment was still uneasy, and the trend might fluctuate. Yesterday's progress was that the market opened with chaos, and prices were mixed, differing by about 0.05 to 0.4 yuan. In the second round, the leading positions slightly recovered by 0.1 to 0.45 yuan. After that, due to a sudden surge in selling from number 50, the trend reversed from the 22nd level and turned downward, slightly decreasing by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. At the close, the market turned slightly positive again, with the leading positions uniformly recovering by about 0.2 to 0.5 yuan. From the 22nd level, the market turned positive by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The trend was fluctuating, and there were many rollover transactions on the market. Retail investors seemed to be holding steady. In summary, the market price results were mixed, with both increases and decreases, which was quite chaotic. For example, the overall 6 increased by 0.45 yuan, while the 20th level still decreased by 0.5 yuan. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was almost 1 yuan. The total trading volume was 20,331,000 yuan.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Falls Again</p>
<p>According to a report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market fell yesterday (10th) due to pessimistic sentiment on Wall Street. Speculators awaited the results of the Maine election and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. United States Smelting, Refining and Mining plummeted by 7 yuan, because the company's profits were not as good as generally expected, causing disappointment. However, rumors claimed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the stock's movements. Commercial news was good. The Cayuga Copper Mine continued to issue a dividend of 0.15 yuan. The US Steel Corporation's exports increased by 3,000 tons in August, so the market's potential was still good. Due to the sinking of the "Malu Fort" ship, the Atlantic, Gulf and West Indies Steamship Lines plunged by 4 yuan. The small exchange market also fell. In the bond market, US government bonds fell slightly due to the Treasury Department's announcement of a bond issuance plan. The total daily trading volume was 700,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Date　Date　Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　90.82　89.26　Down 1.57</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　31.14　34.10　Down 1.04</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks　19.96　19.60　Down 0.36</p>
<p>40 Bonds　92.20　91.95　Down 0.25</p>
<p>11 Commodities　63.59　62.70　Down 0.89</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Rebounds and Rises</p>
<p>Market Bottoms Out, Attracting Bullish Interest</p>
<p>After falling for two consecutive days, the yarn market suddenly rebounded and trended upward. This was due to spot purchases in the South, as well as the rebound in raw cotton. Furthermore, a speculator named Mr. Wang saw that auction yarn had fallen by more than 10 yuan compared to its high price and showed some interest in long positions, purchasing several thousand bales. This boosted public sentiment, and the market turned upward. However, the situation for foreign cotton was dull.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Recovers 0.8 to 0.9 Yuan</p>
<p>The auction yarn market opened with declining trends in US and Indian cotton. However, the market was not very weak because spot yarn sales had been good the previous day, and the bulls were calm. Prices for all months rose by 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, and 0.17 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales were still at 1,800 to 1,900 bales, and major players had purchased in the morning, making the market more bullish. Prices for all months rose again by 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, and 0.17 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 32,400 bales. Dafu sold 750 bales, Changji sold 400 bales, Yichang sold 700 bales, Xiecheng sold 800 bales, Dachang sold 950 bales, Xiesheng sold 1,050 bales, and Yuanda sold 700 bales. Shenyu sold 550 bales. Dafeng bought 1,050 bales, Suilong bought 450 bales, Jifeng bought 650 bales, Shenchang bought 1,400 bales, Changfeng bought 1,200 bales, Runkang bought 1,200 bales, and Yuanda bought 550 bales. Changyu bought 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and the closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Auction Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>September　176.6　175.5　176.6　Up 0.80　38,800</p>
<p>October　178.9　177.8　178.6　Up 0.70　58,050</p>
<p>November　180.5　179.1　180.3　Up 0.90　59,800</p>
<p>December　181.3　180.3　181.1　Up 0.80　57,950</p>
<p>January　181.9　180.9　181.8　Up 0.90　52,050</p>
<p>February　182.0　181.7　182.7　Up 1.10　18,150</p>
<p>Total　284,800</p>
<p>Spot Sales Weak at 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are healthy. It is found that the various groups bought a total of 1,960 bales, and the prices are similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 375, Northern Group 75, Yunnan 80, Tianjin 260, Wuhu 10</p>
<p>Mainland 350, Peers 510, Shantou 20, Fujian 10</p>
<p>Jiangxi 5, Changsha 110, Luzhou 25, Ningbo 30</p>
<p>Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Bullish</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm. Although the US and Indian cotton markets are unanimously trending downward, a certain cotton company in this port is buying in large quantities during the downturn, and the amount of bales has reached 20,000 to 30,000, causing the market to dry up and suddenly tighten. However, the opening price of Tong Yao flower at the dock is trending downward, and transactions of current cotton in various factories have not been smooth.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's Bulls Increase Positions Significantly</p>
<p>The auction cotton market opened. Although the Indian cotton decline was strong, a cotton company in the market was buying in large quantities without limit prices, and the market tightened, causing prices to rise by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan. The market remained bullish in the afternoon, and there were more buyers. Prices for all months rose again by 0.1 and 0.2 yuan. However, the opening price of current cotton was mediocre. The total transaction volume for the day was 79</p>
<h3 id="e16">The Issue of Civic Education in National Revival (6) by Zhang Yuanruo <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(II) Cultivating Social Virtues</p>
<p>To cultivate social virtues, the following two points must be noted:</p>
<p>(1) First, we must be for society. The biggest flaw of Chinese citizens in the past was selfishness. Due to selfishness, public interests were harmed. Therefore, the most important thing for us to cultivate social morality in the future is to eliminate this inferior root of selfishness in the people. At the same time, we must promote and carry out the inherent social morality of the Chinese people, such as cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world, filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, as well as the principles of civic education. I think the hearts of the Chinese people have really been selfish to the extreme. Even those who engage in the national salvation movement have lost their minds and squandered the donations for national salvation into their own pockets, becoming rich through the national salvation movement, and building their status on the national salvation movement. With people's hearts so selfish, what hope is there for the nation? Therefore, I hope that all principals and teachers present will never let students be selfish again, but should teach them to be for society and inspire their social solidarity. A friend who has lived in Japan for a long time told me that the Japanese people's social sympathy is very developed (this is of course only for themselves). Japan is a mountainous country, often with uneven mountain slopes. Laborers cannot push things up the slopes, and passers-by, no matter who they are, even high-ranking officials, will help them push the things up the slope. This spirit of mutual assistance can be found everywhere and is not considered strange. This is because the general public has a very developed social sympathy, so they are never selfish and never stand idly by. They have this universal, great spirit of mutual assistance, cooperation, and harmonious unity.</p>
<p>(2) Second, we must observe discipline. If we want to unite the strength of the nation, we must have social discipline. We hear the slogan of uniting to overcome national difficulties every year, but our nation is still divided and unable to unite, which is truly embarrassing. From a sociological point of view, the origin and survival of society must depend on unity. Even in the totem societies of primitive times, there was already a spirit of unity. People united under a totem, working together and fighting together, with a very good spirit. It is because of this spirit that modern society has developed. Therefore, the most important element in the formation of a society is unity. Without unity, a society cannot be formed. A society without unity will inevitably collapse. If we still do not unite under this sociological law, our nation will be destroyed and unable to survive. But how can we unite? We must have social discipline. Discipline is the first step to unity and an essential element of social life. Therefore, Mozi advocated "promoting the same" in order to universally love and save the world from chaos. Mozi said, "In ancient times, when people were born without government and punishment, one person had one meaning, two people had two meanings, and ten people had ten meanings. As the number of people increased, the number of meanings also increased. Therefore, people affirmed their own meanings and denied the meanings of others, so they criticized each other. As a result, fathers, sons, and brothers harbored resentment and hatred within the family, unable to harmonize and unite. The people of the world harmed each other with water, fire, poison, and drugs, to the point where they could not help each other even when they had the strength to do so, and they could not share their surplus wealth. They concealed good ways and could not teach each other. The chaos in the world was like that of birds and beasts." The current situation in China is exactly like this. If we want to save the chaos of the present situation, we must be able to "promote the same." Promoting the same means sacrificing individual prejudices, taking into account the overall situation of the country, and obeying social discipline.</p>
<p>(III) Advocating Self-Reliance</p>
<p>This is my third old saying. The motive and content of self-reliance are very long to explain, at least 500,000 words. I have already spoken about its outline at the National Shanghai Medical College. I discovered this doctrine on New Year's Eve last year, under the candlelight of watching the year, in the sound of firecrackers, looking back and looking forward, with many emotions. I summarized this principle from my speeches in the past ten years, and used self-reliance as my motto for self-encouragement. The content of self-reliance is very complex, and now due to time constraints, I can only talk about its general meaning. In its simplest terms, self-reliance is a national salvation doctrine that is based on obligations and responsibilities, and targets the country and society for national mobilization, effort, and self-strengthening. As for the function of this doctrine, it is to remove all the roots of the diseases of the Chinese people, and replace them with all kinds of new spirits. For example, the root of the disease of the Chinese people is empty talk, and my self-reliance is to act. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is vanity and arrogance, and my self-reliance is to be pragmatic. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is opportunism, and my self-reliance is to be hardworking. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is seeking advancement by luck, and my self-reliance is to work hard. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is blaming others, and my self-reliance is to blame oneself. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is dependence, and my self-reliance is to ask for oneself. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is laziness, and my self-reliance is to be diligent. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is following the old ways, and my self-reliance is to be progressive. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is complacency, and my self-reliance is to be hardworking. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is cowardice, and my self-reliance is to be resolute. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is fighting for power, and my self-reliance is to fulfill one's responsibilities. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is selfishness, and my self-reliance is to be loyal to the public. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is revelry, and my self-reliance is to struggle. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is consumption, and my self-reliance is to produce. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is listlessness, and my self-reliance is to be persevering. The root of the disease of the Chinese people is fear of difficulties, and my self-reliance is to be brave. Therefore, my self-reliance can be said to be a good medicine aimed at the roots of the diseases of the Chinese people. Since the pathological state of Chinese citizens is so, and the national crisis is very serious, we can also say that the current era is the era of self-reliance, not the era of liberalism. Because self-reliance is a national salvation doctrine of self-strengthening and struggle, it can promote nationalism. However, the drawbacks of 18th-century liberalism have produced romantic and decadent individualism, which is really not suitable for the current needs of our country. I advocate self-reliance in order to defeat this romantic and decadent individual liberalism, and to fight for the survival of our Chinese nation. We must all realize that the meaning of life is to struggle upward without懈怠, and the life of the nation is the total achievement of the national effort and struggle. As heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman strives for self-improvement. Only if our national people continue to work hard and struggle, can we produce the long-lasting life of the Chinese nation. From now on, if the citizens of our country can follow the principles of self-reliance, and strive to encourage themselves, then the result of the efforts of the 400 million people of the whole country will be that the expansion of our national power will surely shock the world. Therefore, my self-reliance is an important principle that those who educate citizens in our country in the future cannot ignore.</p>
<p>V. Conclusion - The Basic Work of National Revival</p>
<p>The basic work of our national revival is education. The purpose of education is nothing more than to train the people, to train the people to have a sound intelligence and morality, and to use this sound intelligence and morality to improve the status of the nation and increase the strength of the nation. It must be known that the function of education is the driving force for the evolution of a nation, and even of all mankind. Without education, mankind would not have evolved. The reason why mankind has evolved to such a civilization today is all thanks to education. You are all serving in the field of education, and I hope you will recognize the purpose and function of this education, and strive to inspire the driving force for the development of this national life, so as to improve the status of our nation and increase the strength of our nation, in order to complete our mission of saving the country through education. We see that after Germany was defeated by France, their only way to save the country was the proposition of "saving the country through education," which Fichte loudly called for. Later, in less than twenty years, Germany actually revived from this. This is the best example of saving the country through education. Therefore, since the outbreak of the national crisis, I have been determined not to sing high-sounding tunes, not to deceive the people, and to advocate saving the country through education. I think the pathological state of the nation is already so serious that lofty discussions are not only useless, but also misleading. Therefore, we should still bury ourselves in hard work, following the old sayings of "ten years of accumulation" and "ten years of education," and strive to teach our people, so that they all have sound intelligence and morality, so as to increase the strength of the nation and improve the status of the nation. This is the basic work and fundamental way of national revival. In history, and in the world, the strength or revival of any nation is entirely the result of the long-term, consistent, arduous struggle and practical efforts of all the people of the country. Therefore, I hope that all the teachers present can uphold this belief, assume this responsibility, and go deep into the people in a down-to-earth, hardship-avoiding, sincere, and uninterrupted manner, to teach citizens, and to lead citizens by setting an example, so that every citizen in our country can eradicate his inferiority, and every citizen can generate sound strength. Then, I believe that these old sayings can certainly save the unprecedented national crisis and revive our great nation.</p>
<p>Old sayings, humble and without lofty theories, thousands of words, I will stop here for now. I hope that everyone will put words into action. This is my greatest hope for today's speech. Recorded by Jiang Jiaxun. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e17">Economic Recession <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Gong</p>
<p>Kong Gong discusses "qi", but there is one kind of "qi" that has not been added, and that is "economic recession".</p>
<p>This "qi" is something that many gentlemen and officials can describe. No matter if you ask a big merchant or a small merchant, a big spender or a small spender, a big shot or a small shot, they will often say, "The recent economic recession in business, coupled with the bankruptcy of the rural economy..." and so on, and you can understand a lot. If you are discussing economic matters, you can immediately understand what they are talking about.</p>
<p>This phrase flowed into China around 1928, and it has been popular for the past three years. It may continue to circulate. Its origin is in Japan. It comes from the same source as "駄日迭士" [TN: Likely a reference to Japanese loanwords becoming common].</p>
<p>Why has it been popular for the past three years? Because there was a flood before and a drought after, and even the West Lake, which was frequented by important people and great men, has dried up into something like an inkstone. In between, there were wars, Puyi leaving the customs, and the fighting in Shanghai, all of which contributed to the spread of this phrase.</p>
<p>Is it that the breadth and richness of the Chinese language does not have a term to describe this situation? Yes, there are, such as "the people are shattered," "the people's livelihood is withered," "all the way is desolate," "business is slow," and even more elegant ones: "the people have no way to live," "the people are dying and fleeing," "leading beasts to eat people," "the common people are in misery"... or even more bluntly: "the people have no food to eat." However, these terms are mostly official jargon, used to the point of being hackneyed, or they are too bleak, and both the speaker and the listener change their expressions in dismay. To be both expressive and up-to-date, and not too extreme, these three words are still the best: economic recession.</p>
<p>Being beaten once is certainly infuriating, but after two or three times, the anger decreases, and cold cynicism increases, losing self-confidence, and sometimes even feeling humorous and suspicious. By the time one is accustomed to being beaten, one "knows that it is natural" and wants to be calm and composed. Humans are largely animals that obey habit, and therefore it is even more tragic. For example, these three words "economic recession" have some elements of humor and helplessness, as well as contempt, humor, poverty, and habituation. To understand what the emotions of an era are like, you have to stand in history or in the position of a different kind of person.</p>
<h3 id="e18">The Yearner of Beiping <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>It is autumn.</p>
<p>At dusk, the sky is filled with floating gray clouds; layer upon layer, occasionally looking up, one sees this vast twilight and a feeling of sadness wells up in one's heart. It is difficult to analyze the reason for this: it is probably because it is already autumn, and in an instant, harsh winter days will come. Having grown up in the tropics, it goes without saying that I have no fondness for the rustling north wind: even for the white snow, I have not written an article praising the snow in the past two years, nor have I said a word to anyone expressing my liking for the snow.</p>
<p>But this year there is a slight change.</p>
<p>Bathing in temperatures above 100 degrees was a common occurrence this summer. Drenched in sweat all day, one is tired and unable to read or do anything - this suffering made me curse the season of summer countless times: at the same time, I quietly hoped that the autumn wind would blow on me soon, and even admitted the benefits of winter in front of people.</p>
<p>"This is the first time I've heard you express affection for winter."</p>
<p>Lingling, that nagging woman, said to me with a smile. I didn't know what kind of attitude she was using to say this to me, so I just looked at her for a moment without answering.</p>
<p>"Do you want to go to Beiping?"</p>
<p>"Beiping?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I'm asking if you want to go to Beiping?"</p>
<p>Feeling that Lingling's words were too abrupt, I inexplicably closed my mouth in front of her, but she immediately noticed that I was suddenly dull today, and declared again with disapproval:</p>
<p>"I'm going to Beiping."</p>
<p>Then she told me that there was a man in Beiping who liked her and could entertain her: there, she also planned to like that middle-aged man a little...</p>
<p>"But, you asked me--"</p>
<p>"If you want to go, wouldn't it be nice to go together?"</p>
<p>"Uh--"</p>
<p>It's impossible to go to Beiping with Lingling. I like Lingling too, how can I let her go to that man's house? So, I shook my head and refused. Only a week later, on a night with a slight hint of autumn in front of the train station, I saw her off on the train and returned alone.</p>
<p>...Now the autumn is getting deeper day by day, and Lingling has probably arrived in Beiping long ago. Because Beiping has that nagging woman, I began to express my longing for it. During the short days of winter, treading on the snowy ground, letting the sharp north wind pierce my body; no matter how long the road is, I am still full of vigor! I will listen to the tinkling wind chimes in the dark night with a different feeling, and I will patiently count the slow, heavy steps of the camels outside. - Beiping is so worthy of my praise! Isn't it, Lingling is already living there.</p>
<p>But when can I go to Beiping?</p>
<h3 id="e19">How I Write a Play <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Written by 奥立莎, Translated by 宜闲</p>
<p>奥立莎 (U. Olesha) is a famous Soviet playwright and novelist. He has written several plays such as "The Ledger," "The Plan of Emotions," and "A Fat Man," which have been performed in major theaters in Moscow with considerable success. In this essay, he describes the process of his thinking when writing a play, using examples. Those who are preparing to write a play can learn some skills from this. - Translator's Note</p>
<p>玛莎 (Masha).</p>
<p>Age: Twenty-three.</p>
<p>Her husband. Has a small mustache. Works very tired - at least, he says he is very tired.</p>
<p>The husband's name is Boris Mikhailovich - Borye.</p>
<p>He likes to tease others. It is his greatest pleasure to make people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>When he completes such an action, he laughs so hard that tears come out. After laughing, he takes off his pince-nez glasses and wipes his eyes.</p>
<p>He even wears a pair of high boots.</p>
<p>Small mustache, pince-nez glasses, high boots.</p>
<p>When he returns home from work, his first question is about dinner. "Hey! How's dinner coming?"</p>
<p>A dish rack. Neat. He goes behind the screen to wash his hands. When he is behind the screen, he participates in the conversation of the people on stage.</p>
<p>On stage are Masha's father and Dr. Grafinkel. Dr. Grafinkel is a neighbor.</p>
<p>Characters: Three</p>
<p>Husband</p>
<p>Father</p>
<p>Dr. Grafinkel</p>
<p>The husband comes out from behind the screen, still wiping his hands.</p>
<p>Masha's father is an old man. Nodding his head. Like a gray goat. Can cook. Says, "I have the talent for cooking."</p>
<p>A person's character is revealed in his actions - this is obvious. But character is also revealed in a person's relationship to things. In this play, I want to express each person's view of various things, and unfold the characters of the characters. For example, take the tram. I imagine that the character called husband is an egoist, with some instinct of a property owner, and a narrow-minded person with deep-seated prejudices. Even before he appears, I want to make the reader understand what kind of person he is.</p>
<p>Husband (coming out from behind the screen): "Today I waited for the tram - hey! It took a full forty minutes!"</p>
<p>Father: "Terrible!"</p>
<p>Husband (to the doctor): "Hey, how are things, Abramo Milanovich?"</p>
<p>This question is asked casually and does not expect any answer. The husband has no interest in how Dr. Grafinkel is doing. He is only interested in his own affairs.</p>
<p>Doctor: "Fine, thank you."</p>
<p>Husband: "Do you know what kind of unexpected discovery I made?"</p>
<p>What does he find unexpected?</p>
<p>"Today I was thinking on the tram - what kind of people are coming up from the front! Let me count them. First are the women leading children. Right? Then are the members of the Moscow Soviet."</p>
<p>Father: "And the disabled soldiers."</p>
<p>Husband: "That's right, disabled soldiers. You see, women leading children, members of the Moscow Soviet, disabled soldiers... and the blind, the old soldiers who fought in the war. And probably tram workers? And volunteers? And all kinds of strangers... Can't guess what kind of people they are!"</p>
<p>Grafinkel then interrupts this conversation about the tram. This character is the opposite of the husband in personality. Therefore, he has to talk about the tram in a completely different tone.</p>
<p>Doctor: "When I wait for the tram at the tram station, it always seems like the tram I'm waiting for will never come. For example, today, I was waiting for the tram. Of course, route 17 didn't come,... I just kept waiting. Not a single tram was seen... Then the trams came, empty, three in a row, but no route 17. I couldn't help but think that the whole group of people were waiting for route 17. If I started waiting for another route, that route wouldn't come either, and the whole group of people would start waiting for that route. I'm really a demon who hinders city traffic."</p>
<p>In this way, even before the play begins, we can make the audience think about what kind of characters we are exploring. The doctor has a sense of humor and can laugh at himself (this is a sign of rationality), and naturally also has some poetic style. The husband is clumsy, ill-intentioned, and his soul is corroded by shallow ambition.</p>
<p>The doctor goes out, and the husband immediately turns his back and says:</p>
<p>"...Our doctor is really very that - you know what I mean."</p>
<p>Six fifteen.</p>
<p>Masha is about to come home from work.</p>
<p>This is the scene at the beginning of the first act.</p>
<p>What kind of furniture do they have?</p>
<p>A dish rack with several partitions. Black, with carved spiral patterns on the legs.</p>
<p>A sofa with covers.</p>
<p>A dining table in the center of the room.</p>
<p>An armchair. This is the dining room. The father sleeps on the sofa here. The washstand is behind the screen.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The husband is impatiently waiting for dinner.</p>
<p>A conversation about the doctor begins.</p>
<p>"If he was a good doctor, he would hang up a sign, but he... he works in the theater," the father says.</p>
<p>The father is just talking about what ordinary people have said. There are people who have no opinion except for nonsense. For example:</p>
<p>"Medicine is not very trustworthy. Only surgery can be trusted."</p>
<p>A piece of nonsense. He heard this opinion expressed somewhere. Now he repeats this opinion, thinking it is his own conclusion. This character can be portrayed to make him eccentric. For example, we can teach him to say something like this:</p>
<p>"I have a fish skin coat, that's what I call this piece of clothing."</p>
<p>Or say:</p>
<p>"In this kind of thing, I say - rather than not doing it, do it slowly."</p>
<p>He believes that only he can say these things.</p>
<p>Grafinkel calls him "Mr. Nonsense."</p>
<p>Mr. Nonsense is satisfied with his life, himself, and his relationship to the world. In his opinion, everything is clear and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Grafinkel works as a full-time doctor in a theater. He can be said to be a "stage doctor."</p>
<p>In appearance, he resembles Verdi. (Verdi, a famous Italian opera composer - Translator's Note)</p>
<p>Fifty-six years old.</p>
<p>A pair of bright, energetic eyes.</p>
<p>Messy hair. Gray beard - thicker on one side. Agile movements. He tilts his head back.</p>
<p>Abramo Milanovich Grafinkel. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e20">He Buys One Shoe (Middle) <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>"Eight dimes a pair is not okay?... Alright, I owe you four and a half dimes--I'll buy one." The soldier said, reaching into his pocket with his right hand.</p>
<p>"Ha!" The shop assistant spun around swiftly, saying with contempt and disgust, "Brother, we're in business. But we've never sold a single shoe." As if dreaming, he casually added, "Anyway, it's worth a few dimes." He giggled twice as if to apologize, and walked away coldly.</p>
<p>The soldier slowly looked up at him, without making a sound. He took out two double-dime coins from his bag, hesitating as he counted the copper coins. Finally, he pried open the cardboard box, slammed the extra shoe onto the chair, and put the one he needed into the box.</p>
<p>"Hey, is half a dime fifteen copper coins?" Not seeing the shop assistant, he shouted loudly and impatiently.</p>
<p>The boss, as if fitted with a spring, bowed and saw off the female students who were buzzing like flies that had stolen sugar, turning around and bestowing a calmer smile on the soldier who looked like he was about to run wild.</p>
<p>"Ah, what do you want, sir?"</p>
<p>"I'm buying one shoe." The soldier didn't think there was any possibility of his request being rejected, and confidently counted his copper coins. "How many copper coins is half a dime?"</p>
<p>After several failed attempts to persuade him, the boss, as if wronged, suddenly jumped up angrily: "Humph, we don't make shoes for one-legged people. Think about it for me, if everyone was like you, wouldn't we be losing money in business? Where would we find customers with lame right feet?"</p>
<p>"But who told me to lose a leg? Right, if every Chinese person was like us, then the Japanese wouldn't be sitting in enjoyment in the Northeast..." He said in a low voice, holding the cardboard box under his right arm, and stood up, wanting to go outside. Another fat shop assistant jumped forward quickly and held him down.</p>
<p>The yelling and cursing that exceeded the bounds of humility and peace attracted many busybodies, idle rickshaw pullers, and some bolder women. They cut off the traffic on this prosperous road.</p>
<p>"Beat him, beat him! A troublemaker in the market, a robber; the money we earn is not enough to donate to you useless people. Ha, it doesn't matter who it is, as long as we don't have to pay so many donations..." The boss incited his subordinates madly, like a commander on the front lines, and seemed to be seeking sympathy from someone. But before anyone made a move, someone in the crowd surrounding the "Lu Heng" shoe store shouted unfairly.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's easier than plotting against a crab that has lost its claws!"</p>
<p>"Beat me? I haven't met a thug! I treat the Japanese devils' tanks as mountain ants. What are you? A blood-sucking gourd!" He cursed without getting too angry, while parrying the enemy's fists with his wooden leg.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Greatness of Shanghai <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ren</p>
<p>They call it the tallest building in the East. Once the International Hotel, towering on Jing'an Temple Road, is completed, if someone were to climb to its peak and look down upon Shanghai, undoubtedly, in the boundless expanse and the countless dwellings like beehives, one would see only the crisscrossing roads, smaller than strips of white cloth, and the trams hopping like mantises, the frog-like automobiles, and the pedestrians, seemingly neither advancing nor retreating, slowly pacing like ants. This is the greatness of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Indeed, Shanghai is great. Here, besides the trams and automobiles that shake the entire city from morning till night, the coal dust from large factories, mixed with the roar of steam whistles, surrounds the great Shanghai in a state of unrest.</p>
<p>Moreover, besides all these visible and audible, leaping and clamoring things that fully demonstrate what kind of place Shanghai is in the present world, there are countless hidden things that cannot be seen from the twenty-four stories of the newly built International Hotel. These are the various social patterns that constantly emerge in the daily newspapers.</p>
<p>If I were to further distinguish them in detail, it would not be difficult. The following is a list:</p>
<p>Regarding theft, belonging to the aspect of "wealth":</p>
<p>Robbery (at least three cases daily)</p>
<p>Petty theft (at least ten cases daily)</p>
<p>Grand larceny (at least three cases daily)</p>
<p>Regarding deception, also belonging to the aspect of "wealth," but the conditions are relatively less simple:</p>
<p>Kidnapping (at least five cases daily)</p>
<p>Fraud (at least five cases daily)</p>
<p>Regarding illicit sexual relationships, belonging to the aspect of "lust":</p>
<p>Abduction (at least ten cases daily)</p>
<p>Rape (at least five cases daily)</p>
<p>Regarding fights and killings, belonging to the aspect of "spirit":</p>
<p>Brawls (at least five cases daily)</p>
<p>Vendettas (at least three cases daily)</p>
<p>Regarding death, encompassing the three aspects of "wealth, lust, and spirit," this is what is called: life, what is called "living."</p>
<p>Suicide by poison (at least three cases daily)</p>
<p>Drowning (at least one case daily)</p>
<p>Death from exposure (at least one case daily). Cases increase in summer and winter. Death from old age or illness is not included.</p>
<p>As for other opium pills, morphine, gangsters, accomplices, beggars, etc., there is no need to list them one by one. Just the horizontal list of numbers above is a grand spectacle, enough to represent the greatness of Shanghai (?). As for the "at least" number in my list, some are not reported in the newspapers. Moreover, even if you search through the several courts in Shanghai, you sometimes cannot prove their accuracy. But the greatness of Shanghai is real. Here, in this foreign concession, although there are many security agencies and it can be said that there are numerous police and detectives, the trivial social news that is missed in the streets and alleys, not publicized, becomes a permanently hidden evil. Who dares to say that it absolutely does not exist?</p>
<p>Indeed, Shanghai is great, and the great Shanghai must have such great deeds. Are not those things I mentioned above great (?) deeds? If Shanghai did not have the various great deeds mentioned above, then it would almost certainly not be ordinary. I hope that Shanghai will forever be great, and I heartily congratulate Shanghai on being able to produce the various extraordinary deeds mentioned above.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Nocturne, 1934 <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>(Street scene: Autumn sale, discounts from 15% to 90%; Mid-Autumn mooncakes on the market; newly arrived autumn fabrics; take the Shanghai Municipal Ferry to see the moon,</p>
<p>go see the moon!</p>
<p>People: hurried, leisurely, hateful.)</p>
<p>Having no rice is already commonplace; but since yesterday, even the half-sack of sweet potatoes we dug up has been eaten. This morning I went to     to     borrow       , but I couldn't borrow. "The second son, even if he dies poor, still has a small shop, which is ultimately better than oneself."</p>
<p>However, on the way back, from far away, I saw the bag in Ah Hu's hand: damn it! It's empty. Ah Hu crumpled it into a ball and used it to wipe sweat.</p>
<p>My heart sank suddenly as if someone was pulling it down: empty! We have to go hungry for another day!"</p>
<p>But Ah Hu, the young lad, with youthful suspicion, came closer and said, "I couldn't borrow rice. The     in the city      ."</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Ah San's father couldn't stand it any longer, "You dead thing, were you just wandering around the streets! What did your second uncle say?"</p>
<p>"He said he didn't have any rice either, that rice was too expensive, so he didn't buy any, and was eating sweet potatoes instead. Business in the shop wasn't good."</p>
<p>Ah San's father would be sixty after the new year. This "near the flower-armor" age was precisely what he considered most worthy of boasting about; but now he was a little doubtful: no one had ever seen such a year; farming, collecting rent, doing business, working, nothing went well, no one could get by. "The story of the world being in great chaos was something I heard people tell when I was young, but Ah San's father never understood one thing. What he didn't understand was: if the world is in chaos and everyone is doing badly, then who is doing well?"</p>
<p>This "who is doing well" was his biggest doubt. If someone is suffering losses, then someone must be profiting. When everyone is suffering losses, who is the one who is profiting?</p>
<p>Saying that the one profiting is someone like Wang, the old master at the head of the village, he and Ah Hu used to believe it a bit; but now it's not reliable anymore. Old Master Wang relied on more than three hundred mu of land to "sit and eat," but this year there was a sudden drought, and the more than three hundred mu of land were filled with dry and rotten rice stalks. Didn't Lao Zhang, the servant of his family, say that day? He also has his troubles, his annual expenses all rely on the land, and this year he couldn't get a single cent. The donations and taxes, they say, couldn't be reduced. I heard that his eldest son, who was studying at a university in Shanghai, couldn't afford to study this year either. The whole family wants to move to Shanghai.</p>
<p>So, people like Old Master Wang are not the ones profiting either.</p>
<p>Raising his head, he saw Ah Hu, holding the empty bag, also staring blankly: "You dead dog, we have nothing to eat, do you know that?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, he remembered that today was the thirteenth day of the eighth lunar month. There "must be some business" in the old second son's grocery store. Ah Hu is a child, so he should go again himself.</p>
<p>As if hope was at hand, Third Uncle put on a short cloth shirt and eagerly walked towards the street on the cracked fields.</p>
<p>But: what a miracle! The thirteenth day of the eighth month, even if I'm confused, I can't be wrong about this. Aren't the shop doors on the street also plastered with red and green paper strips? But how could it be so deserted? Not to mention buying, there are very few people even looking or crowding around. What's wrong? What's wrong?</p>
<p>Walking to the front of his second brother's shop, which read "Jing Guang Grocery," he heard his second brother's loud voice. Walking inside, his second brother's face was flushed red. He looked up and saw Ah San's father:</p>
<p>"Third brother, you've come at a good time. You think about it, is business good? There's no harvest in the countryside this year, and the market is so bad, everyone can see it. Several old customers are still pressing me like that, every family is tightening up, the market is so bad during the festival, it's not just us. Look at them, some people won't even let go of debts of ten or so yuan. Fine, fine, all my stuff is here, do whatever you want, these days are really not the way. We're still going hungry during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Third brother, I don't want anything anymore, let's become bandits!"</p>
<p>This was strange! It was the first time that Third saw tears in his brother's eyes.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Ghosts Are Also Modern <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>Since there are scientific spirit mediums before, and scientific fortune-telling after, everyone is superstitious, so there is naturally no objection to holding a ritual in the alley.</p>
<p>Moreover, although my friend Black Cloud Sand uses ghosts to deceive people, he still hires monks and Taoists to play music and have fun with the ghosts. Everyone contributes a few cents, like listening to a blind girl sing erotic songs while cooling off.</p>
<p>Furthermore, nowadays ghosts are also becoming modern. Those monks and Taoists have forgotten their own art of making a living, and instead of chanting "Namo," they pitifully perform "Qiu Xiang" and "Special Express," singing and dancing wildly, saving the benevolent philanthropists from having to stand in front of foreign goods stores, tilting their heads to listen until their feet and backs ache.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why "Qiu Xiang Express" has deeply penetrated the realm of Buddhas and ghosts is very clear. The Empress Dowager's cry of "Shake, treasure, shake," shakes people's hearts. Born as a Chinese, one naturally dies as a Chinese ghost. People share the same heart, and ghosts share the same reason. The paper-made wireless radio in the Qiao Linglong display window is not just opportunistic.</p>
<p>In such a flourishing and peaceful atmosphere, many people fear that the world will be in chaos and are loudly calling for the danger of a second world war, truly not understanding the modern reasoning of Chinese people and Chinese ghosts. Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e24">Autumn Sound <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3 id="e25">A Trivial Matter in the City <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ren</p>
<p>He staggered out of the tavern.</p>
<p>The moon hung in the sky, and the bored patrol officer was hanging around in front of someone's opium den. The restless city had returned to a state of quiet. He straightened his chest, took a deep breath, and felt that today was the most comfortable it could be. He strode forward, heading straight home, but his consciousness was dominated by alcohol, and everything could not go as he intended. Treading on the moonlight, he unknowingly walked to the Bund. A White Russian reached out to him, begging for money. When he put both hands into his pockets, he realized that he was as poor as that White Russian. He sobered up by half. He thought of his sick wife at home, and then, with his eyes wide open, he pondered his day's activities.</p>
<p>His wife had been sick for a long time. He had consulted many doctors, who all said that it was only a matter of prolonging her days. But when his wife heard this news, she started to make a lot of noise in bed every day, scolding him for having no conscience, for surely having some wild woman outside, only hindering her. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, she would cry for no reason, disturbing his sleep, and he had to get up very early the next day to go to the factory. In fact, after hearing the doctor's words, he was really very depressed. He had come to Shanghai alone, worked hard and frugally, and married this woman. Not to mention messing around outside, even in the two years of their marriage, he had never come home even a little late. Now, because of his wife's illness, he never left her bedside except for work, and many of his hard-earned savings had been spent on his wife's illness, and he was also a month behind on his wages from the factory. He hoped every day that his wife's illness would get better. Now he couldn't concentrate on his work. During the ten hours at the factory, he thought about his wife every second. When he heard the factory whistle, he ran home as fast as he could. He only felt relieved when he saw his wife sleeping well in bed. But his wife would say those crazy things out of nowhere. At first, he thought that his wife was not feeling well in her heart, so he let her say whatever she wanted and quietly sat beside her to rest for a while. But his wife thought that he was being hypocritical and scolded him even louder, as if he had already married a woman outside and was just waiting for her to die. And because he didn't have money to hire a doctor for the past two days, the woman seized on this and said that he had bad intentions, saying all kinds of nasty things. Sometimes he was really tired and lay down without paying attention to her, but the woman still wouldn't let him go, shouting and screaming.</p>
<p>This day was Sunday, and the factory had a half-day off. He didn't go home either, but went to a friend's dormitory and hung out for half a day, and then went to a small tavern to drink alone. He didn't have much of a capacity for alcohol, but today he drank for more than two hours, spending all the dollar in his pocket, and then patted his body and walked out as if he had completed a major official duty.</p>
<p>Now that he was sober, the scene of his wife slapping the bed and table naturally surfaced in his mind very clearly. He was unwilling to go home no matter what. He patted his pockets at the White Russian, indicating that he had no money, and walked forward aimlessly.</p>
<p>He didn't go home the next day either. He didn't show up for work at the factory either. He disappeared, and no one knew where he went.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Rainy Dusk <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In this rainy dusk, boredom and depression occupy my mind, and I feel lonely.</p>
<p>I always have this contradictory mentality, always loving to recall the past. But in recalling the past, I am clearly grasped by reality. This unbearable pain of reality, unfortunately, deeply devours my heart.</p>
<p>The raindrops outside the window, as big as beans, hit the glass window and bamboo curtain, making a rustling sound. The sky is as black as lacquer. Sometimes, streaks of golden light flash out. Occasionally, there is a rumbling thunder.</p>
<p>Loneliness, emptiness. A heart shrinks tightly, contracting. The flowers of youth were crushed long ago under the wheels of time. What is hope, what is happiness, but sharp arrows that cut flesh and blood, gilded curtains collapsing in the middle, bright spring flowers withering in the middle. A weak life, tossed and turned in the grip of the demon of fate.</p>
<p>Indeed, someone tells me that this is a world of the survival of the fittest. It is a world of power. Someone else tells me, what's the use of just fantasizing and being sad? The environment is man-made. There is a road only in front of the fearless. The final victory is only robust struggle, but what comfort is there in all this? Struggle! Wrestle! My result is being locked in a small room, listening to the wind howling and the rain crying. Letting bitterness and loneliness torment me. What about my comrades on the front line? Struggling to the last drop of blood, the last drop of sweat. The starved die of starvation, the suddenly deceased die of sudden death, a pile of blood and yellow earth. That is the destination of their lifelong struggle.</p>
<p>Alas, what comfort is there in all this? The rain is still heavy. The dizzy brain feels dizzier. Loneliness, depression, in this rainy dusk, is no better than starving to death. I would like to open the gate of hell of death, rescue my comrades, and then throw myself in to imprison me.</p>
<p>The rain is still heavy. Pouring down. Down. The dizzy brain feels dizzier.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>At this time, Shi Min also chimed in:</p>
<p>"Dad, look, this one has it too."</p>
<p>Xu Zhai looked and, sure enough, it was true, so he also said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Hmph, this is nothing like a foot, every chicken has it."</p>
<p>"Hey, you guys are really strange," Uncle Feng Yun seemed a little annoyed; "This kind of small mole is on every chicken, but this kind of big one is a foot, why don't you believe it?"</p>
<p>However, Aunt also had her reasons, and she insisted:</p>
<p>"Then this is just some being bigger and some being smaller, why is the big one definitely a foot? Then what is the small one?"</p>
<p>"Then there's nothing I can do if you don't believe it. Anyway, it's not just me saying this, which family in the village doesn't kill a few chickens? Some families kill almost every last one."</p>
<p>Looking at him, Uncle Feng Yun was already very angry. Afterwards, it was Xu Zhai who came up with an idea; he thought that Feng Yun's words were, of course, unreliable, but killing a few chickens wouldn't be a big deal, so he said to Aunt:</p>
<p>"Whether it's true or false, just kill those chickens that have very long moles, anyway, if you kill the chickens, you'll have something to eat."</p>
<p>When it came to killing chickens to eat, Shi Min was naturally very happy. Originally, whether chicken was delicious or not didn't matter to him, but if the Qin Hui in the chicken brain could be bitten out without breaking it at all, then the appearance of his hands tied behind his back and kneeling was really quite interesting.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Shi Min was so happy that he ran to the kitchen to get a knife. Uncle Feng Yun laughed when he saw it, and stroked the top of his head, saying:</p>
<p>"You should thank me for this, otherwise where would you have chicken to eat?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, you don't study hard, but you come running when it comes to killing chickens. Good-for-nothing, lazy, really useless."</p>
<p>When Shi Min heard his father say this, he felt a little embarrassed, so he tugged at his aunt's sleeve and pulled her to the kitchen. At this time, Uncle Feng Yun was also preparing to leave. When he carried the small dung basket out of the gate, he heard the sound of chickens squawking in the kitchen, which seemed very pitiful. Xu Zhai, as usual, sent the guest to the door and then came back. A gust of autumn wind swept past his shoulder from between the leaves, seeming a little chilly, making him shiver.</p>
<p>He walked back and lay down on the bamboo reclining chair in front of the corridor. The chair had already been padded with a woolen blanket since the day before yesterday, and it was very comfortable to lie on. However, from this blanket, he was reminded of a story. This was still in the year of Wu Chen, and this year is Xin Hai, so it has already been four years. Because science had been abandoned, after he passed the Xiucai exam, he never had a chance to go to the provincial capital to enter the examination hall. So he qualified as a Lin Sheng and was admitted to the Academy of Law and Politics. Last year, he graduated from the Academy of Law and Politics and spent almost one hundred yuan on foreign money. Now he has finally hung a blue-bottomed gold-lettered vertical plaque in the ancestral hall, which reads "By Imperial Grant, Graduate of the Academy of Law and Politics, Eighth Rank Rank," and the small characters on the left side are "Minister Shi Xi." This blanket was bought when he went to the province to take the exam for the Academy of Law and Politics that year. Afterwards, he rode a horse to visit guests, and it was taken in and out by the servants for several days. Speaking of it, this woolen blanket also has a glorious history. But now that I think about it, it feels a bit like a dream, a bit of a feeling of being in another world, but that feeling is still not bad.</p>

<h3 id="e28">American Sister Flower Cars Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Namely, the 1934 Nash and Lafayette New Cars</p>
<p>Produced by the American Nash factory, Nash and Lafayette cars are what people in the automobile industry call American Sister Flower cars. As the name suggests, we should know that these two kinds of cars are mostly exquisite, beautiful, and wonderful, just like a pair of sister flowers, perfectly matched. I recently heard that the 1934 new cars have already arrived in Shanghai and have been displayed by the local dealer, Hejin Company, at the sample room at 694 Jing'an Temple Road for public viewing. Therefore, I took the time to go and see them, and I believe that their reputation is well-deserved. The sister flowers certainly have their strengths. Now, I will briefly describe their advantages below.</p>
<p>The 1934 Nash new car, which is known to the world for its noble, luxurious, exquisite, beautiful, and wonderful qualities, is divided into three major categories, with both six-cylinder and eight-cylinder models available. All cars, in addition to having Nash's meticulous and ingenious design and construction, and other traditional advantages that are too numerous to mention, the biggest feature that they are all equipped with is the twin-ignition overhead valve engine. Twin-ignition devices were originally limited to expensive vehicles, but now all Nash products are equipped with them. This is truly unexpected and worthy of our praise, because this equipment not only makes the engine run more smoothly, but also increases the original power more than a single-ignition motor of the same size. In addition, the speed and the mileage per gallon of gasoline are also increased as a result. The appearance of the new car is thoroughly streamlined, so it feels even more spectacular, beautiful, and moving. In short, Nash new cars, whether in terms of mechanical performance or appearance, are the pinnacle of perfection, worthy of being the latest masterpiece of this year. As for the Lafayette, it is truly a low-priced car, but it is indeed the latest type of vehicle with all the advantages of an expensive car. Its style is extremely beautiful and spectacular, and its movements are particularly agile and clever. As for the equipment, decoration, and machinery, they are all rarely seen in other vehicles of the same price, so wherever the Lafayette goes, it is captivating, and the desire to love it arises spontaneously.</p>
<h3 id="e29">The New Aircraft-Powered Hupmobile <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Gui</p>
<p>Beautiful and Moving Style</p>
<p>Magnificent Mechanical Efficiency</p>
<p>Recently, according to the local Hupmobile dealer, Fulin Automobile Company, the six-cylinder and eight-cylinder Hupmobile new cars not only have the latest streamlined beauty, but their body design also has great progress and unprecedented features. This feature is none other than the so-called aircraft power. The chassis of the new car is extremely strong and excellent, so its effectiveness is even more magnificent. As for the new-style body, its appearance is extremely beautiful and moving, so wherever it goes, it stands out and is sure to attract people's attention. The wheelbase length of the new car is 121 inches and 127 inches. The 121-inch is equipped with a six-cylinder engine, and the 127-inch is an eight-cylinder engine. All chassis and bodies are uniquely designed and specially designed, completely integrated as one, with no distinction between them, so the degree of their strength and consolidation has reached the pinnacle of perfection. As for the appearance of the new car, it is completely different from ordinary cars on the market. One of the characteristics of the aircraft-powered body is its high visibility. Anyone who is in the car, looking around, sees everything clearly. The screen window hinges are much wider than those installed on ordinary vehicles, and their position is closer to the steering wheel, so the range of view for the driver is even greater. The six-cylinder engine produces 93 horsepower at 3,400 revolutions per minute, and the eight-cylinder engine produces 115 horsepower at 3,500 revolutions per minute. This engine not only has more abundant and fuller power, but its operation is also extremely stable and comfortable, and this situation is even more obvious at higher speeds. The lubrication of the new car has been redesigned to make it even more perfect. Even if driving at high speed continuously, it can cope with it easily. The new car now uses an air-cooled generator, so it can have a higher electrical rate, and the installation of wireless radio and other electrical equipment is not a problem. There is no need to worry about the lack of electricity.</p>
<h3 id="e30">American Automobile Sales in England Increase Daily <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>Significant progress in the last five months</p>
<p>The automobile manufacturing industry of Great Britain has developed a lot in recent years, and its protection of its own market is very thorough. Copper walls and iron barriers, foreign automobiles are rarely sold in England. However, there is always an exception. Recently, some American cars have gradually been exported to England. Therefore, in the British automobile market, there are now</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Nanjing Jiangnan Automobile Company has been in operation for three years and has achieved remarkable results, providing convenience for travelers. Last week, a delegation from the company came to Shanghai to visit various bus companies, tram companies, Yunfei Automobile Company, and the new batch of Liver goods vehicles that Madi Automobile Company had just received. They were extremely satisfied. The picture shows the Madi Automobile Company hosting a banquet for the delegation at the Great Eastern Restaurant. One of the people sitting in the center of the front row is Wu Zhuozhi, General Manager of Jiangnan Automobile Company. One of the people standing in the back row is Zhuang Liqin, Manager of Madi Automobile Company, and to his right is Cao Naiwen, Chinese Manager of Global Automobile Company. Further to the right is Li Zhiqing from this newspaper.</p>
