<p>溯自一九二零年國聯設立裁軍經常委員會以來。爲時已達十有餘載卽言一九三二年正式裁軍大會之召開迄今。亦已兩易寒暑。其間或開全體大會。或開總委員會。或開小組會議。或開主幹會議。爲數之頻。幾難數計。提案之多。爭持之烈。節目之繁。亦令人目爲之眩。頭爲之昏。然考其二年來之演變。叩其果有若何之結果。若何之成績。則不能不令人失望。</p>
<p>其最顯然者。卽歷次會議之結果。不獨未命軍備有何縮减。抑且有重行擴張之勢。我人以爲參與軍縮會議之列强。果有縮軍之誠意。當以限制德國軍備之凡爾賽和約第五章爲討論基礎。蓋在該章條文中。恊約國本有追隨德國之後共同裁軍之聲明也。當日恊約國爲此聲明時。其意以爲和平障礙惟德一國。德苟裁軍至和約所許限度。則各國之共同裁軍。自無問題。且細玩此一聲明之語氣。實含有各國裁軍以德爲標凖之意義。且欲求各國軍備之眞正縮减。亦非以此爲標凖不可也。</p>
<p>乃自首次軍縮會議開會而後。能以和約第五章爲討論基礎者絶少。各列强類皆爾推我諉。别有懷抱。如英國之意。在於專談陸地軍備之縮减。藉以削弱法國在歐陸圖覇之勢力。法國知其然。故除藉口［安全］之一詞外。復提國際海軍之組織。隠示欲圖操縱英國海軍之微意以爲對抗。至於意大利之與德共鳴。純出於平日對法之嫉忌。意在分法之勢以强固己國之地位。其眞有切實裁軍之誠意者。實绝無一國。以故德國憤懣不平。至是年七九三二年）九月十四日卽退出會議。軍縮會議之變爲軍擴會議。實始於此。蓋各國旣不欲將其軍備降至德國之水凖。則舍容許德國稍整軍備外。自無他法。經英國數月之斡旋。遂以産生轉變軍縮局面之五强宣言。許德在不危害他國安全之條件下。享有平等權利。經此宣言之後。則德國重整軍備之舉動。已成爲合法之行爲。延至去年三月十六。英國草案提出。更使德國重整軍備之地位爲之强固。蓋按照此一草案。德國於八年之内。可將常備軍擴至二十萬人。而法意波蘭等國。則須於八年内减軍至二十萬人。斯時英國之意。以爲旣不能使法國裁軍。自以重行武裝德國爲得計。殊不知擴軍之勢。卽由是而潛滋暗長。一年以來。事實所昭示於人者如此。就最近數月英法德三國間之往復磋商而觀。擴軍之勢。有增無已。前此英國不許德國置備之小型坦克與重砲。亦皆主張給予。而德對常備軍之要求。則有非三十萬人不可之槪。至於法國。尤不能無所懷疑。似含有推翻前年五强宣言之意。於此錯綜矛盾之局面下。再開軍縮主幹會議。谓其可有良好結果。其誰信之。</p>
<p>縱觀此二年來之軍縮會議。可知此會議。不獨毫無成績。且有助長各國擴軍之實。蓋昔日實行縮軍之國家。旣將重整軍備。則目今武裝雄厚之國家。焉能獨自縮軍而甘於落後故英國今日之計劃。徒使各國爲軍備之競賽。不能於和平有若何裨益也。英國向來之傳統外交政策。不欲於歐陸有一難制之强國。故於日俄戰前。英嘗聯法以制俄。日俄戰後。則聯法制德。至今法强德弱。自以聯德聯意爲得計。故其主張。始終着目於陸地軍備之縮减。法如不願縮减。則不妨使德國稍增武裝。而又未肯輕易表示。果如是者。殊無以釋歐陸各國之猜忌。而於軍縮前途。實不能有所解决也。</p>

<p>英提議召集一會議</p>
<p>討論公約保障問題</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日歐洲軍縮問題鈎心鬥角之棋局上、法國復有一着之進展、蓋卽法國對英國所提出諸問題之新答復、所以陳明法國之立塲者、已於今日電逹法國駐英大使也、法國所陳之理由、似仍在保障恊約中各小國之利益、而於軍縮本题上無甚進展、但此處政府方面則謂法國旣已接受英國重開談判之請求、則於軍縮之進行、確已有一進展云（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英法關於軍縮與安全保障之談判、表面困難尚多、然英國提議續開軍縮與安全保障會議之照會、今日已由英國駐法大使鐵里耳爵士送交法政府、且已爲法政府所接受矣、法國外部現亦趕行草擬答復英國之照會、法國將在其照會中接受英國之要求、並闡明法國之立塲、尤其將着重於英國在今後［軍縮條欵］受有危害時所負之保證責任、據稱、法國之照會在本星期杪卽可完成、而交與鐵里耳爵士、外間盛傳法國政府將在共照會中剴切説明何種保證始受法國之歡迎、上項消息甚關重要、因其能使垂斃之軍縮會議、重得一綫之生機也、以前英國政府亦曾用盡方法、以探求法國對於英國最初軍縮備忘錄之特殊意見、然結果則終無所得、而法國對於英國最初軍縮備忘錄中之一節、卽關於法國受敵人攻擊時所引起之保障問題態度、尤爲暧昧云、法國在其由古平大使轉交英國政府之照會中、説明法國之所欲接受者係疆土的保障而非普通的保障、但未來之保障問題、究竟能進展至何種程度、此則非吾人所可得而知矣、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門今日終日研究法國關於軍縮之牒文、據路透社所知、法國來牒證明英國備忘錄現尚有進步、法牒承認時局景象中之若干變遷、法國前對於德國現有的重置軍備之程度、且不願予以承認、但今則表示討論德國重置軍備計劃之凖備、不過法國仍主張最後之判决、須操諸軍縮會議耳、法牒確使人發生可成立軍縮公約之更大希望、同時法外長馬爾都在談話良久之後、語軍縮會主席漢德森、法代表圑可贊助四月二十三日召集軍縮大會之提議、漢德森旋首途赴日内瓦、俾於星期二日主席於軍縮會主幹部之會議、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）豫料一星期内法政府將復以關於軍備之牒文致英政府、聞文中將提議凡半軍事組織、當設法使之無害、公約之履行須嚴加監視、凡違背公约、須卽予以初步之經濟制裁、衆料英法兩國對於後二條件將作友好的奮鬥、蓋法國不欲軍備公約留有餘隙、英國則反對嚴加束縛也、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本年三月二十八日英政府曾以正式公文一件、提交法政府、對於法國三月十七日覆文所稱軍縮公約實施上保障、提出若干問題、請求法國政府加以説明、其後英國政府又命駐法英大使泰利爾勛爵以三點詢問法國政府意見、（一）法國本身軍備之裁减、（二）英國計畫中許予德國之利益、（三）軍縮公約實施上之保障、今晨舉行國務會議時、外長巴爾都將所擬答復英國問題之口頭照會提出討論、當經國務會議通過、英政府所提各項問題、均須由外交手續上從長研究者、口頭照會僅戰簡答復、照會内容略稱安全問題、素爲法國政策所注重、英國當局能以了解、殊足欣幸、惟英政府所擬之軍縮公約、法國於未接受以前、欲先知其技術上條欵如何規定、英國方面對於法國本身軍備、有所主張、法國政府則以爲必俟英國所認爲必須賦予德國之軍額及軍器、爲法國所明瞭以後、法國始對於本身軍備有所表示、口頭照會又謂德國重整軍備、如予以正式承認、則其他受條約限制之國家、亦將援例要求、至於以何種方法、保障未來軍縮公約、使不受侵犯、則稍緩將由外長通知英國外相、以目前而論、英國主張允許德國部分重整軍備、同時法國開始裁軍一層、法國不能承認云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美國産業復興的成績（紐约通信）</h3>
<p>一年的回顧經濟未改善勞資仍對立前途多荆棘</p>
<p>整頓藍鷹運動的新辦法</p>
<p>羅斯福總統從去年接任到今日、剛剛一年、在這一年之中、他的成績何如、凡是留心美國現勢的人、大槪都能有相當的認識、卽最有好感的人、對他也還是不滿意、關於羅斯福氏實行復興産業、｜｜藍鷹運動｜｜、约有兩種的批評、第一類是以爲過去一年、羅斯福氏確曾盡了最大的努力、縱然没有如預期那樣的成績、設使没有這樣努力的話、則美國受經濟恐慌的襲擊、必然更要厲害、所以應該對復興産業、表示相當的滿意、第二類是以爲羅斯福氏這種運動、是無軌道的火車、用了很大的精力、而得不到什麽成績、他誠然是盡了最大的努力、而所得的結果太小了、</p>
<p>藍鷹運動自施行以來、於今八個月了、物價雖然在去年九月間、曾略略向上漲高、但到了年底、又向下跌落、最近來更有急轉直下的傾向、非但海外的市塲、一時不易發展、蘇聯的定單、依然是很有限、他處則同受經濟恐慌的影響、而且在國内、還是没有回復一九二九年以前繁榮的象徵、於是乎就惹起了多方面的反感、特别是勞資兩方面的反感、其所以會惹起反感的原因、大致如下、</p>
<p>（一）爭論得最激烈而又連續不斷的、是勞工的圑體交涉權、依復興法第七條的規定、工人是可以自行組織圑體、并且這種圑體的代表者、由工會選舉出來、他們可以與資本家締結契約、同條并保證工人可以加入工會、援助工會、組織工會、所以工人都先組織起地方工會、進而形成全國的工會、借這種强有力的圑結來進行交涉、在資本家方面、自然很嫌厭這種組織、甚至不承認其存在、例如ＵＳ鋼鐵公司就拒絶與合衆國鑛夫工會作圑體交涉、這類的糾紛、頗有延長的可能、（二）縮短工作時間、雇用工人、須保證其最低工資、提高工資之後、隨着就是物價高漲、這恰與藍鷹運動的精神相反、</p>
<p>（三）資本家爲掩飾其損失的關係、所以在現時情勢之下、總設法使工作能力緊張、要生産更多的出品、於是資本家對工人採取攻勢、這又是糾紛的一大原因、</p>
<p>（四）工人的情形、事實上并未怎樣改善、勞工長官巴金斯女士、曾講過到本年三月业、重行被雇入廠的工人、不過二百五十萬、美國的失業者、至少有一千萬、多則有一千五六百萬、可是工資從去年六月到年底、增加了百分之一○·六、生計費則袛增加百分之五·四、這是藍鷹運動的結果、然而據新國民雜誌的計算是、從去年六月到十二月個人工資指數、祗增加得百分之三·七、而生計費指數、則增加了百分之五·四、凖此則藍鷹運動收支結算的結果、工人所得、更在去年六月貧窮缐以下了、</p>
<p>爲了這種關係、美國的經濟革命、至施行</p>

<h3>滬北斛米工人因反對取消酒資罷斛</h3>
<p>市黨部决令米行業勸告</p>
<p>本市滬北運米客商、因宣告取消斛司之斛酒、（卽斛米酒資）以致發生罷斛風潮、茲悉詳情如下、</p>
<h3>斛酒沿革</h3>
<p>本市斛司、每斛米一石、斛力爲二十四文、南北市一律、由來已久、民國元年、由運米客商給付斛米司、每斛一石、給酒資十文、其用意爲使斛司於斛米時重輕之間、稍形帮助、民十八年、改爲五十文、十九年改爲二分、迨米價漲至二十五元一石時、因輕重之間、相差頗鉅、故運米商特增爲每石二角、及至米貴風潮平定後、仍爲二分、一二八時又變爲五分、自去年迄今、乃爲三分、</p>
<h3>計劃裁撤</h3>
<p>斛司雖名爲米行雇工、然米行僅供給膳食、並無工資、其收入一爲固定之每石二十四文之斛力、一爲斛酒、一爲經售米糧方面（卽俗謂掮客一類）之酒錢、近因米價步跌、故運米客商方面、宣告自四月一日起取消斛酒、爲斛司所反對、曾於五日罷斛、旋有少數運米商、則欲返原籍、故有給資請斛者、有斛而待决給資者、荳米行業及斛司工會、曾呈請黨政機關請求交涉、</p>
<h3>斛司罷斛</h3>
<p>因運米客商與斛司之斛酒爭執、致少數運米商宣告拒斛、及斛司罷斛、滬北經售米糧公會、以此事關係民食、誠恐因一部之爭執、影響社會安寗、故曾向雙方調停、爲每石二分、亦屬無效、昨日蘇州常熟江陰安徽宜興江北各帮、已有開斛、惟無錫帮則僅屬少數、昨日錫帮運米商范喜生金國標二人、因在碼頭阻止斛運、與斛司一度爭執、幸未發生變故、</p>
<h3>黨政處置</h3>
<p>本市黨政機關、因恐案情擴大、市黨部於昨日下午四時、派書記長姜懷素、會同民運科樊國人、社會局派四科周鳴崗、前往該處澈查眞相、據市黨部姜懷素向新聲社記者稱、黨部方面、以此事係屬一部之爭執、故决令米行業向雙方勸告、以期早日解决云、</p>

<h3>保釋出獄之李淑芸來滬就醫</h3>
<p>因神志頽唐不願見客</p>
<p>李文輝否認進行和解</p>
<p>因無錫公安局長劉倬民抗不交代、牽涉蘇省民政廳長辜仁發夫人李淑芸母女、而引起辜氏重婚騙婚等複雜案件、喧騰全國、辜氏因遭各方抨擊、致辭職離省、雖經錫地方法院傳訽對質、辜卒未到、李母女業由李叔文辉保釋出獄、於前晚來滬就醫、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>保釋就醫</h3>
<p>日日社記者曾於昨晨訪李文輝、叩詢李涉芸母女到滬後之行踪、據李答、淑芸在獄、因受剌激過深、憂傷結　、遂致肝胃病劇發、身體與神志、頽唐不堪、故業已入醫院療治、惟入何醫院、因淑芸不願會晤親友、暫守秘密、俾可靜養、</p>
<h3>和解不確</h3>
<p>據李氏表示、外傳淑芸來滬將進行和解之説、實非確詞、惟預料傳説之由來、或卽辜之意思、亦未可知、蓋重婚案與劉倬民案、絶然兩事、固不可併爲一談、而淑芸則切望案件能水落石出、得鳴不白之冤、不過和解之關鍵、繫於辜方、而不在於淑芸也、故淑芸病體稍好、仍將赴錫、</p>
<h3>疋頭工人罷運後日本市疋廿餘萬運津</h3>
<p>日本洋布暢銷華北</p>
<p>第一批一進丸裝去</p>
<p>本埠天津帮各報關行之裝運洋布疋頭老司夫、因客家不付車資、實行罷工、報關行方面、亦以風潮决裂、停止報裝疋頭、因此中國布疋、竟不能運赴華北、日本洋布、獲得良好時機、大批裝往、現在第一批價值二十餘萬元、已經運去、工潮之情勢嚴重、本館記者昨與該業中人晤談、承告此事經過及現狀如下、</p>
<p>報關行之末運</p>
<p>天津一埠、每年上海裝去疋頭甚多、在十年之前、客家全要報關行代辦、一件洋布、除去水脚雜費外、可餘二元數角、近年客家多直接向紡織廠或各洋行購辦、報關行僅代報運之一部分、一二八後、市况不景氣、滬上日本報關行首先跌價、並廢除每件由客另付二角八分之老司夫車貼、而祗收客人二元九角五分一件的運費、華商報關行以營業所在、亦不能不隨之减價、按每件洋布（總名疋頭）、除輪公司付水脚費二元五角二分、拔力七分、碼頭車力二角四分、其他雜費、約三四分外、報關行凈得、不滿大洋一角、如有損傷缺少、且負賠償之責、故報關行之裝運天津疋頭、已至有虧無餘之地步矣、</p>
<h3>工潮之難解决</h3>
<p>每一家報關行中、裝疋頭老司夫、多則四人、少祗二人、歷來報裝天津疋頭一件、除運費外客家另貼二角八分與老司夫、報關行則不問之、今年自日人首倡二元九角五包運價後、客家對此二角八分貼費亦宣告取消、老司夫向報關行爭索、而報關行所得、不滿一角、如何能允、遂致罷工、此事發生、已歷多日、市黨部與社會局亦調解多次、各報關行因認此車貼、必須虧本、無論如何、斷難同意、寗可將疋頭老司夫工薪酌加、萬不能賠付車貼、而工人方面、對車貼必須爭到、而增薪則絶不在意、故風潮難以解决、</p>
<h3>報關行亦停運</h3>
<p>裕豐盛向來裝運天津洋布獨多者、自此次工潮發生後、該行已盡願放棄報裝疋頭營業、而改報雜貨、而復記報關行、且能罷工後得到種種不利之傳聞、已經將營業暫行停止、對於天津疋頭、概不報裝、卽其他雜貨、亦暫行停報、寗願將職工暫予解雇、不願作此鷄肋之生涯、蓋近自海關新章公布、凡屬客家繳納證金後、均可自由報關、致報關業之生意、乃大受打擊、一旦發生事故、咸抱消極主意、</p>
<h3>日布顿然起色</h3>
<p>據報關業中人言、每年從上海運往天津之疋頭洋布、至少有十萬件、價值二千萬元、近年抵制劣貨以後、國産布疋、在華北銷塲、已佔相當勢力、此次罷工風潮發生、國産布疋、已無法報裝、天津帮以市面需要、不能卽行止辦、而日本布疋得此良機、乃競向天津裝銷、本埠各日商紡織廠利用日輸、由日人報關行代報代裝、已有大批裝往、在罷工風潮後之第一批日本布疋、係平田日報關行經報裝一進丸至天津、有一千數百件、價值二十餘萬元、尚有大批日本布疋、將裝長沙丸等各日輪赴津、</p>
<h3>國産布疋受阻</h3>
<p>又據該業中人言、此次罷工、不特爲日貨造機會、而於本國各廠之布疋、在華北銷路、亦受重大打擊、蓋日報關行此次所用報裝日本疋頭之工人、亦係中國工人、專裝日本貨者、如果此項工人亦加入罷工、日人凖備改雇日籍勞工或俄國工人代替、不使運輸阻斷、而中國則更受罷工停運之兩重阻力矣、</p>

<h3>讀書問答</h3>
<h3>小小十年中所表現的</h3>
<p>婚姻問題</p>
<p>讀書指導</p>
<p>來信</p>
<p>來信提出葉永榛先生著的，小小十年中所表現的婚姻問題。關於本書，在好幾年前，編者雖然讀過，但留下的印象已經非常稀薄：且又手邊無書，無從參閲，暫不想隨便下什麽批評，（如果讀者需要，是可以批評的），現在只就你所收集的兩家的意見［及你自己的］［説明］加以解釋。</p>
<p>我們以爲：你所提出的兩家相反的意見，表面上均有相當的理由，而實際是同樣有錯誤的。爲什麽？因爲處理任何問題，如果不從它的社會的根源去求解答，只在問題的本身上兜圈子，是永遠得不出正確的結論的。這就是説，他們均没有把握着婚姻問題或者戀愛問題的核心。</p>
<p>婚姻問題，是一個社會問題，它的變更是由社會的變更來决定之。在男性中心的社會内，女子是奴隸，是戰利品，婚姻就成爲一種買賣；到資本主義社會，如你所説一樣，一切商品化了，婦女也不能例外，雖然形式上有所謂自由變愛，但這戀愛是建築在金錢上面，以及由金錢而發生的虚榮，欺騙和淫蕩上面。這樣説，並不是忽視婚姻問題，對於人生的重要，而是指出我們應該從社會的見地去認識之重要性。要廢除買賣式的婚姻，不肅清殘餘封建勢力是不成功的；要享受眞的自由變愛，不改變私有財産制度，也是不成功的。這一點，雖不是你所要問的問題，但這却是解决一般問題的出發點。（未完）</p>

<h3>兒童節的由來</h3>
<p>— 達齊</p>
<p>兒童節的由來，是民國二十年上海慈幼恊會向國民政府呈請，將節期定在四月四日，經政府核准，到今年已是第三度，猶如小孩誕生三週歳了，兒童節名詞，是肇始於外國的，如美國兒童節是五月一日，又將十二月的第二個星期那一天，呌做貧苦兒童的幸福日，英國將七月十四日定爲兒童節，日本兒童節又分男女兩日，三月三日定爲女童節，五月五日定爲男童節，無論是那國的兒童，到了這天，全國各地，舉行演講，討論兒童問题，當怎樣謀改進！怎樣謀幸福？又開游藝會，供給兒童這天娱樂，全國兒童的爸爸媽媽，將新衣給自己小兒女穿着，和我國尋常過節的情狀一般，尤其特别的，是美國總統府在兒童節這天開放，小朋友可自由進去遊玩，總統看見了，還和許多小朋友握手，並且凡是到總統府遊玩的小朋友，總統對每人都送一包糖菓和一本書呢！</p>
<p>我們中國，也認清了兒童是將來的主人翁，所以取法外國，定四月四日爲兒童節，一是唤起全國人們注意到兒童，一是促進全國兒童自己的反省：似此這樣看重了小朋友，又是何等的期望小朋友啊！</p>
<h3>童子軍</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>我要做一個童子軍：</p>
<p>我不是想戴那尖形的呢帽，穿那整齊的短裝，結那綠色的領帶，掛那明亮的徽章。</p>
<p>我不是想住那露天的營幕，唱那歡樂的歌曲，吃那自燒的野味，玩那大伙的游戲。</p>
<p>我愛集圑的生活：我更愛全世界的小友。他們都是我的哥弟姊妹：我們要一樣的工作！一樣的休息！一樣的享受！</p>
<p>我們不避艱險，不畏困難，我們常到田間去捕捉害蟲，常到山林去畋獵野獸；我們逢到河流阻擋我們的時候，便架起橋樑通過；逢到坑溝防礙我們的時候，便合力塡塞坦平；在黑暗的夜晚，我們便燃起火炬，使黑暗和白晝一樣的明亮。</p>
<p>我們要完成偉大的事業，我們要找尋人生的眞義，我們携着手向前猛進，我們終會獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>我們要做一隊勇敢的童子軍！</p>
<h3>古時幾位好學苦讀的人</h3>
<p>— 吳晋華</p>
<p>小朋友：你們對於學校裏的功課用心嗎？現在，我介紹幾位［古時好學苦讀的人］給你看看。一，［匡衡］極好學，但因家貧，所以常　鄰壁，引光而讀，二，［朱買臣］也好學非凡，未發跡前，担柴入市，因讀書而忘了賣去。三，［孫康］家窮無油燈，常借雪之反光而讀。四，［孫敬］因恐睡寢而廢讀，用　套於頭上，一頭吊於樑上面讀。五，［承宫］幼時牧猪，偶過書塾，聞書聲入内求先生教授，蒙允，他用功非常，後成大儒。蘇秦好讀，每於睡時，恒以錐子剌股，到後來學乃成，官至六國丞相。</p>
<p>小朋友：上面就是幾位好學之士。你願像他們成爲大人物嗎？那末，你該用功的讀書。</p>
<h3>鬭鷄</h3>
<p>— 潘承珍</p>
<p>小鷄兒！小鷄兒！</p>
<p>你們鬭得眞有趣！</p>
<p>你向他行個禮，</p>
<p>他也向你行個禮。</p>
<p>弟弟打姊姊！</p>
<p>姊姊打弟弟！</p>
<p>蝴蝶</p>
<p>紅蝴蝶，</p>
<p>白蝴蝶，</p>
<p>雙雙飛上青菜葉</p>
<p>青呀！白呀！紅呀！</p>
<p>青天白日滿地紅！</p>
<h3>抵抗</h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>可惡的冬天，終於歸去了，人們歡迎的春天，已來臨了，這時大地上的一切，都現出復活的氣象。尤其在鄉村中的田野裏，綠油油的菜，爭豔似的開放着金黃色的花，隨着風飄蕩。那紅紅的太陽，漸漸兒的向西方沉下去了。</p>
<p>在這時，有一尾火黃色的大蛇，纏繞在那雜亂無章的野草裏，它正在找尋食物呢？</p>
<p>這邊閣閣閣的高呌着，那邊也是閣閣閣的在答應着，把一個寂靜的鄉間，頓成了一片熱閙的塲所了。</p>
<p>那尾大蛇要想吃掉那些青蛙，便偷偷地溜了過去，把一只弱小的青蛙，囫圇吞了下去，其餘的青蛙，都没命的逃去了。</p>
<p>那些青蛙，見同伴被那强盜般的大蛇搶了去，便開了一個臨時會議，有一只較大而聰明的青蛙提議道：［我們的同伴，被那强盜搶去了。這樣一天一天的過去，我們要是再不起來抵抗，恐怕我們要絶種了，並且也没有地方可住了。］於是有一只青蛙説：［我們的氣力小，身體又小，怎能去抵制那凶惡的强盜呢！］另外一只青蛙追思了一會，站起來説：［不要緊的，祗要我們能圑結起來，一致對外，和那强盜拼命，抵抗到底，一定會得到勝利的。］大家都贊成，就决心圑結起來，果然把那强盜般的大蛇，如熨斗熨過一般的制服了。</p>
<h3>有底的桶和没底的桶</h3>
<p>— 白鵝</p>
<p>從前有一個極有家産的富翁，據人家説，他的出身是很窮的，因此，有一個窮人他也想做到富翁一樣，在有機會的一天，請求富翁傳授他致富的方法。</p>
<p>富翁很客氣，不過並不馬上教他，只説：［我没有方法呀　假使你信託我的話，那麽你拿這兩個桶去打水，今天拿有底的一隻打，拿没底的一隻盛。］説著，拿出兩隻一樣大小有底和没底的木桶。</p>
<p>窮人聽他的話，打到晚上，桶裏一點水也没有，因爲有底的桶打上來的水，放到没底的桶裏，立刻就流盡了，他把成績去告訴富翁，富翁説：］很好，明天你相反做。｜有底的盛没底的打。］　　窮人再依他的話去做，结果，有底的桶裏盛得滿滿的了，因爲，打上來的水，雖祇有兩三點，積久，就多了，於是富人笑笑的説：［這就是我致富的方法呀！我的富，並不是錢能够賺得多，而在能够積蓄所賺的錢，反之，假使能够賺得多而完全用去，不是等於没賺嗎］？</p>
<h3>儲蓄的好處</h3>
<p>把你的錢好好藏了吧！</p>
<p>我藏在積　　裏</p>
<p>媽呀你不要　用啦</p>
<p>把你們自己的　去買</p>
<p>媽！</p>
<p>這是我積起來的錢買的</p>
<h3>晚景</h3>
<p>— 上海智仁勇小學譚寳蓮</p>
<p>堤上那綠綠的樹，和遠處青青的山，高高的塔，返映着那天邊一角紅霞，越顯得晚景的可愛。這個時候，在花園裏，那些嫩綠的草，直挺挺地站着，等候着，初出來的月亮；那羞怯怯的牽牛花，躱在葉叢裏，很像鄉間怕生的孩子，不敢見人一樣。那植在窗外的幾竿青竹，對着牽牛花，嘲笑它没有胆量，不敢昂首去迎接那可親愛的月亮姑娘。</p>
<h3>優游自在的肥猪</h3>
<p>— 褚劍屏</p>
<p>一輛二輪小車上，載着一隻肥頭胖耳的肥猪，　　然的在馬路上推行。</p>
<p>［多麽優遊自在啊！自出母胎，老是吃飯睡覺，從没做過一件事情；現在還要請我坐着車子，出來游歷，這大約是我天生的福分吧］！肥猪很得意的這樣自言自語着：</p>
<p>不多一會，它的小車，已推進了一座湫隘的小屋：這時它的嗅覺上，突然聞到一種很觸鼻的腥氣，但是它素來是舒服慣的，那有心思去研究這腥氣的來源？</p>
<p>這倒不錯！我本來嫌地下潮濕，老早就想弄架床舖睡睡了］！有人把它擱上板凳的時候，它還這樣樂觀的私忖着：可是刹那之間，它的喉部，忽然冰冷的一來，同時熱血四濺，痛徹肺腑，它此時才明白了；但是明白有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！你們讀了這篇故事，還要優遊自在的怕勞動嗎？</p>
<p>小經驗</p>
<h3>空墨水瓶</h3>
<p>我們的墨水用完了，不是還有一隻［空墨水瓶］我們把這［空瓶，］不要抛去；把它積聚起來。大槪積到五六隻的時候，我們自己可以買些顔料，（大約銅元十枚）用開水冲匀，成功墨水，再把冲好的墨水，當心的一瓶一瓶灌好，仍舊變成五六滿瓶的墨水，以後墨水再用完了，［空瓶］仍舊不要抛去，再聚到五六隻時，依舊照前法的做去。這樣川流不息的下去，我們用下來的［空墨水瓶，］可以省去我們不少的錢。</p>
<h3>黑墨頭</h3>
<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>我們用的黑墨，先買來的時候，是很長的，後來每天磨用，就一天短似一天，終於連手拿的地方也没有了，變成一塊［黑墨頭。］當然，這塊［墨頭］是不能磨用了。抛去它嗎？又覺可惜；現在有一方法，可以使它一點都不純費；就是把［黑墨頭，］放在瓶裏，加入適量的水；［墨頭］就慢慢的溶化開來，變成很好的［墨汁。］</p>
<h3>鳥類的嘴巴</h3>
<p>— 俞百祿</p>
<p>鳥類不像人，他們没有手，只有兩隻脚，小朋友！你能猜想嗎？他們用什麽東西來代替的呢？脚只能作站立用，翅膀只能作飛用，只有嘴了，是的，他們是把嘴作爲手用的。怎樣用法呢？讓我來告訴你幾種，其餘，你自己去觀察，去猜想吧。</p>
<p>，你們是常常看見的，它有一隻闊的嘴巴，嘴巴裏面是軟的。因此，雖然在烏黑的泥水裏，它能像我們手指一般用軟的内部去辨别它已含着的東西。又因爲它嘴邊有像牙齒般的小洞，所以在水底裏找食物，只是胡亂的含一口泥，等到頭鑽出了水，它把嘴微微的一動，這樣泥水流出了，其餘的小魚螺絲等都留在裏面當做食物了。</p>
<p>我知道你們都曉得，烏是用着嘴巴造窠的，不過，你們一定不知道裁縫鳥怎樣去造窠，它是用大樹的葉折成筒狀，用嘴巴打了洞，然後去找　下的棉花，像綫樣缝起來，裏面也可以哺養三四隻的小鳥，不過，這種鳥的身體是不大的。</p>
<p>啄木鳥，它是憑着自己鋭硬的嘴，在樹幹上鑽洞而得腐蝕這樹的小蟲，假使你聽到它嗒嗒的啄木的聲音，你可不要驅逐它，因爲對於樹是有益的。</p>
<p>杖鳥可以説最奇怪用嘴巴的了。它的嘴是很長的，除去了用做吃食物之外，在疲倦的時候常常把嘴巴的頂站豎在地上，像老人撑着木杖一樣。</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>小朋友，對於鳥類的嘴巴，你大槪可以明瞭了吧！</p>
<h3>地震</h3>
<p>— 希實</p>
<p>小朋友，你們可知道往年捐錢去救濟我們的敵人｜｜日本大地震嗎？現在讓我來談談地震。</p>
<p>我們所寄托着的地球，最初像火一樣，後來漸漸地從外面凝結起來，變成一層冷的殼，他的裏面，却仍是像火一樣的鎔化了的物質。地殼是有厚薄的，因此常常起了凝縮與膨脹的作用，若一部分的凝縮或是膨脹，速於别部分的凝縮或是膨脹的時候，就發生坼裂或是爆裂，地球受了影響，震動起來，就是地震。無量數年以前，地面　起的稱山，山脚底下的地面很薄，鎔了的岩石，常從最薄的一點，噴射出來，這就稱爲火山。在日本最多的，它在爆發的時候，也可以發生地震。</p>
<h3>楊柳小姐給春風姑娘的信子明</h3>
<p>春風姑娘：</p>
<p>在没有和你談話之前，讓我在此地［立正］向你行［九十度］鞠躬禮，表示感謝［再生］之恩！望你接受罷！</p>
<p>我正被冬　壓迫得氣息透不過，昏暈如死去一樣，失去全部知覺。有一天，糊裏糊塗記着，有一位温順的姑娘，吻着我，慰貼着：我的身上，有了暖的意味：這位姑娘，還替我梳梳頭，换上綠的衣。從此，我居然醒過來，再和人世會面。但我不知那位姑娘是怎樣的人；後來，黃　妹妹告訴我，那知我的恩人喲，就是春風姑娘你！</p>
<p>黃鸝妹妹，天天到我這裏來；伊也是一位和愛可親的，很會説話，伊的聲音怪好聽的，所以有許多人們都愛好伊的。不過，據伊對我説，［如果春風姑娘不出來，主宰世界，寗可啞口終身！］啊！春風姑娘，我知道了，你不是僅僅我的恩人，却是萬物的催生婆！怪不得許多僵臥的鄰友，現在也都點頭曲腰，開歡迎會咯！</p>
<p>殺的世界變了，變了綠的花的世界，｜美麗的世界！</p>
<p>春風姑娘，你是生物的功臣，宇宙的主宰者，我十二分希望你永久佈澤天下！姑娘！再會！終日不敢忘懷你的楊柳：</p>
<h3>春風姑娘的覆信</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>楊柳小姐：</p>
<p>接到你的來信，給與我心靈上最深切的慰安。在未看全文之先，當然在此兩足立正，舉手給你個童子軍答禮。不過，以後望你不要這樣，我俩見面的機會多着呢！</p>
<p>什麽［再生之恩］太恭維了罷？我看了世界上的生物，實在可憐！被冬風婆婆打得皮破血流，薄弱的，經不起伊的肆威，就長臥地下了；但也爽快。不過，那些生不生，死不死，戰戰慄慄，的朋友；使我心酸，滴出同情之涙。</p>
<p>一引起我來主宰這世界的動機。</p>
<p>起初，我用極誠懇的態度，和冬風婆婆商量，還將朋友凍僵的情形告訴伊，伊非但不理會，反而老羞成怒，大發雷霆，變本加厲地壓迫着生物；所以，我也不得不板起面孔，直接和伊抗爭了。</p>
<p>楊柳；小姐，啊！伊的鐵腕眞兇，我險些失敗；好得我有滿腔的熱力，繼續不斷的精神，伊也只好溜走了。</p>
<p>伊溜走了，自然，我義不容辭，來主宰這世界：除了你以外，還要唤醒一切的人們！那人造的天地，太虚僞，我要用自然力點綴成美麗的世界。柳小姐，你依着黃鸝妹妹歌曲的拍子、去放浪地舞罷！再會。</p>
<p>黃鸝妹妹均此快樂你的春風：</p>
<h3>一件新衣</h3>
<p>— 續溪揚溪尚志小學三年級生葛有豐</p>
<p>有一天，我的媽媽預備給我做一件新衣，問我喜歡什麽布？我對伊提議説：［嗶嘰，直貢呢，這是外國貨，我不歡喜。我要本國布。］媽媽聽了，很贊成。</p>
<p>第二天，就呌哥哥到城中去替我買了雪恥布來。雪恥布，顔色好，價錢巧，是本國貨。</p>
<p>新衣做成了，我穿了進學堂去。胡先生看見，歡喜極了。就在晨會上，嘉獎一次。並且呌同學們，以後如做新衣，也要學我一樣買本國布。從此同學們所穿的新衣，也一個一個都用本國布了。　　全國的小朋友們啊！我們大家要同心，無論現在與將來，做新衣都要用本國布才好！</p>

<p>婦女園地第八期</p>
<h3>第二階段</h3>
<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>在這大動亂的年頭，一部份關心着她們自身問題的前進女性、縱然在非常的努力中，還是免不掉一種落在霧中的悲哀。</p>
<p>這現象，並不是説明了一般的女性在解放運動的路程上迷失了方向；而是她們底自願停留在這一個階段上面。</p>
<p>當反抗的女性開始感受到不能忍受的禮教與習俗的壓迫的時候，她們就勇敢地自己提出了這問題之後，從現實中，她們又認清了一切的舊禮教與不合理的社會制度，全是建築在經濟的基礎上面的，於是進一步，就開始努力於經濟獨立的取得，而張起了［女子經濟獨立］的旗號了。</p>
<p>因爲要實踐這口號，於是一般的女性全想找到一個職業：無論職員或勞働者都行，祇要有一個工作，祗要能經濟獨立，彷彿一切的婦女問題便全能在這一點上解决了。遠的事情不説，就是三十年前的一般智識女性與研究婦女問題的學者，還一致地深信［祗要有一個職業，女性就取得了她們自己的經濟能力，同時也能得到一切的解放了。］而在中國，五四前後的智識女性不是也全都毫不疑慮地接受了這一條原則嗎？</p>
<p>於是，社會上便産生了許多［職業女性］。</p>
<p>然而，從體騐中，她們却更學到了一種新的功課：職業女性還是感到一種失敗的恥辱。</p>
<p>誠意地追求獨立的女性，她們是不難覺到商店僱用女職員的特殊作用的；在中國，我們儘能看到職業女性受到特殊的侮辱和玩弄的事實，整千整萬的女性爲了生活，含着一顆疼痛的心在［花瓶］這個侮辱的名詞下面掙扎着，而另一方面，我們也不難聽到有的女職員爲了拒絶了經理的特殊要求而被停了職的事實。</p>
<p>這不是中國社會的特殊情形，就在以［職業女性］爲無上光榮的頭銜的美國社會中，也同樣地顯露着這種現象的；女職員接到了經理的請客單，無論自己有什麽重大的事情，總是不能不到的。此外如舞女，酒食店裏的女招待，電影女演員等，雖然有了一個職業，然而還是在男子的社會下面生活着的，這是一個事實。</p>
<p>於是，他們全都覺到了：有了一個職業，還是給男子們所鎭壓的，眞正的獨立還是得不到的。她們從家庭的籠子裏，從丈夫的手掌裏掙扎出來，走到社會上去辦事，而結果却還是被握在男性的掌握中，不過從一個籠子飛到了另一個籠子裏而已。</p>
<p>現代的婦女運動，就長久的停留在這一個灰色的階段中。</p>
<p>在夫權制度的社會中，女性直接受到壓迫而作爲爭鬥的對象的，便是丈夫，因之她們都以爲有了職業，脱離了丈夫，便什麽問題都没有了。其實一切的事情都不會那樣簡單的，無疑地，從現實的教訓，現代的女性都該明瞭所謂［婦女解放］這件事，决不是在家庭中對丈夫爭得了勝利就算了事的，她們走完了第一個階段後，必須更努力地去繼續她們更艱難的第二階段，而進一步去向舊社會不合理的制度下面掙扎，否則女性想要取得合理的解放，是决不可能的事實。</p>
<p>而况，在這一切都無辦法的時代中，差不多所有的問題都成了人們共有的問題，因之婦女解放，更不是［男女鬥爭］的可笑的喜劇。美國的婦女問題學者彼阿特夫人（ＭrsＢeard）在一篇［女權的末路］的文章中説：［婦女們離了人生的廣義的探索，而努力在狹義地與男子爭勝。以男子所有的權利和自由做對象，努力地前進着，企圖得到與男子同樣的權利與自由，這幾乎是所有的女權運動的唯一的途徑了。因爲這樣，所以她們忽略了未來的危險而迷　於目前的對手。這恰如二個人在放風爭，男子的風箏在前，女子的風箏從後死命地追，她不顧一切，祇想追到前面的風箏，或甚至超過牠。至於在男子風箏前面的一切風雲的變化，她們都不會想到，也不會看到的。］她又説：［譬如女子要求工廠中男女平等待遇，但在工廠中男女都找不到工作的時候，那又有什麽用處呢？］從這兒我們可以看出：當一切都成爲問題了的時候，婦女解放，也該應（而且祇有）在廣義地取得一種合理的社會制度上去入手，才能得到預期的成功。雖然這是一張長期的期票，然而都是十足兌現的。</p>
<p>當然不是否認婦女在家庭中取得解放的必要；要女性在丈夫的掌握中與家事的堆積中去從事社會運動，多半是可笑的，但本文的目的，祇想指出婦女從家庭中得到解放之後，祇是整個的解放的道路上的第一個階段，而要得到全盤的解放，還是不能忽略那第二階段而把目光轉向社會制度上面去的。</p>
<h3>世界大思想家對於婦女問題的意見（一）</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>一康多塞</p>
<p>當現代婦女運動尚在萌芽的時候，首先注意它的，要算法國人十八世紀大哲學家中最後的一位康多塞（condorcet）氏。他生於一七四三年，死於一七九四年，爲法國當時的大思想家兼政治家，精於數學和天文學，並係歷史上著名的法國百科全書的參加人。他在三十歳的時候，不積極的參加各種社會運動：法國大革命開始（一七八九年）時，他曾爲非常活躍的領導人物之一。革命後當選爲［立法會議］的委員。</p>
<p>康氏於一七八七年曾發表了一部馳名的著作，呌做纽哈温的一個公民的信，内中有一篇論男女平權的精萃文字，其大意是説：女性者亦如男性也，天賦情感，具有鑑别善惡之心，因之女性應當與男性享有同等的權利云云。他主張，婦女應有選舉權和被選權，並表示一種希望，婦女應担任一切社會職務，法律不應禁止之。於是男女平權之説，始爲人注意。</p>
<p>一七八八年，康氏又在ＪournaledelaＳociele上發表一文，主張婦女應享有公民的一切權利。</p>
<p>前邊業已説過，康氏爲當時法國社會上的名人，所以自他鼓吹男女平權説以後，尚在封建制度壓迫下的法國婦女，便受其影響，爲之醒覺，熱烈地稱讚康氏的主張，並努力地促其實現。當時受革命脈搏的波動，巴黎和各省大城市先後都出現了婦女的圑體。這些圑體，牠們希望要成爲一種影響國家立法，公共自治機關，及全社會生活的力量，並［履行上天命令，］帮助建立市民的理智國家。牠們主張，婦女要盡同等義務，享同等權利。這些婦女圑體的熱烈的主動者爲顧瑪麗，其詳情俟後專文述之，這兒恕不　及。</p>
<p>男女平權説，現在聽起來似乎是很平淡無奇的。　在一百四十餘年前，慢説在我們古老的中國，就在大革命前的法國，這種學説也視爲洪水猛獸的，因爲那時法國尚在封建制度統治之下，［男尊女卑］的思想，籠罩着人們的觀念，婦女在社會習慣上完全處在被壓迫的地位，在經濟上，法律上，政治上都毫無權利可言。自康氏倡男女平權之説，婦女在社會上的地位始露出一綫的的曙光。所以現代婦女運動是起源於法國大革命時代，但婦女解放思想的倡始者，則要推康多塞！</p>
<p>不過，康氏在歷史上首倡男女平權之説，並非是他自恃聰明，憑空杜撰而來，而有其社會的與經濟的背景。這種背景，就是當時法國新舊社便的交替，舊的封建制度的段落和新的生産方法｜資本主義的抬頭。他，康氏適處在這個時代，體騐新興的社會經濟制度需要婦女解放，需要婦女受教育，到社會上來，所以他才先知先覺，順應時代的要求，主張婦女應與男子平權。我們在研究歷史上每個著名人物的思想時，首先應當注意他的社會背景，這是頂要緊的。</p>
<h3>結婚是不是女子的職業？</h3>
<p>— 女友</p>
<p>我彷彿記得，在不久以前某先生曾在某刋物上，發表了結婚是女子的唯一職業這個宏論。但前天讀了女青年月刋婦女與職業專號上，畹香女士那篇［谈談婦女與職業的關係］文章時，又不禁使我迷惑起來。</p>
<p>畹香女士在她那篇論文裏，曾肯定的説：結婚决不是女子的職業。結婚究竟是不是女子的職業？或唯一的職業呢？對於這個問題，我認爲實在有重新確定和研討之必要！</p>
<p>當然，説結婚是女子的唯一職業，也是有着他們所謂很多的理由的。但是，眞理祗有一個。究竟那一方面是正確的，對的呢？爲着使問題更加明析起見，我覺得有預先説明職業究竟是什麽？這個名詞的意義之必要。</p>
<p>職業是什麽？［直接的説：所謂混飯吃可以當作職業的解釋，平常人謀職業往往説找飯碗］這是本報副刋上，署名［冬］先生，在他的大作［女子結婚的重大使命］裏，對於職業問題的高論。但這種解釋是否是對的呢？很明顯的，這是不正確的？因爲對於無論什麽問題，我們决不應只作膚淺的表面的觀察，或祇依照一般世俗的陳腐見解。我們必須站在社會科學的立塲上，從經濟的意義上去理解和分析，然後方能够洞察問題的眞義。</p>
<p>固然，在目前的現社會裏，一般人通常都是把職業當作維持生活的［飯碗］解釋的，但科學告訴我們，常識不見得一定是對的？一切問題的正確解决，還有賴於科學。</p>
<p>所以對於職業究竟是什麽這個問題，我們從經濟學的觀點上，嚴格的分析起來，那不過是社會生産勞動的一部分分工而已。</p>
<p>四馬路的野鷄，出賣肉體來維持生活，一般人雖然都認爲這也是一種職業，但是經濟學的意義上説來，是根本不能够算做職業的？因爲那不過是目前私有制度不合理的社會内面，一種腐蝕部分，特有的畸形物罷了。</p>
<p>職業的定義，旣然如上所述，那末結婚是不是女子的職業，已經是很顯然了。</p>
<p>當然，我們也很瞭解，説［結婚］是女子的唯一職業，是含有侮辱和諷剌的意味的，因爲在目前的社會環境裏，一般婦女，卽使在未結婚前，已能够在經濟上獨立的婦女，在結婚後，也還是大多放棄了自食其力，而完全的依賴着男子的，一般人旣認爲能够維持生活的卽是職業，那也無怪乎某先生要嚷呌着：結婚是女子的唯一職業了。</p>
<p>根據上面的解説，我們最後的結論是：畹香女士認［结婚决不是女子的職業，結婚不過是男女共同生活的起點］。是絶對正確的，至於説結婚是女子的唯一職業，這種論調在我們看來，不僅是錯誤的世俗偏見，而且是對於一般婦女惡意的諷辱！</p>
<h3>前後</h3>
<p>— 諒</p>
<p>｜生活片斷｜</p>
<p>記得在七八年前吧，我還在求學時代；那時我的生活是優裕的，心地是天眞而純潔的。本了我善感的天性，更受了文學的陶冶，憧憬着一個理想生活｜戀愛至上的迷夢。世上的名呀，利呀，在我都以爲是身外物，無足輕重。人的欲望往往需要一種超乎物質｜精神上的滿足，我常常這樣想。那時我唯一的希望，是要一個有高尚的思想和人格，不爲物囿，不爲境移，充滿了熱誠的戀人，賤不足患，貧不足憂，只要有了超乎一切的神聖的戀愛，我能蠲棄一切，犠牲一切，在美麗的，温柔的，富有诗意的愛域裏，陶醉我的一生。</p>
<p>從這觀點出發，我物色着我的終身伴侣，不久在我的同學中找到了。他的一篇論文是我認識他的有力的媒介。那是一篇寫景抒情之作，秀麗的文字，超脱的思想，深深的把我吸引了。富於情感的我的心靈，本不容理智的裁制，從此就認他爲我理想中的人物，同時又知道他的好學深思的態度，和不同凡俗的見解，增加了我對他的敬愛；在相當時期認識以後，我們就正式的成了婚約，實行同居之愛。同居以後，接觸的時間多了，漸漸的雙方發現了許多性情上，習慣上，思想上之不同。時間過去，這樣的發現愈多，好多次竟因此發生衝突。當然，我俩的愛情受了大大的波折，而我的心靈也受了絶大的打擊。最使我痛苦的，是我的理想的全歸泡影。當一個人一旦把他的信仰推翻了，整個的打破了時，所餘下的祗是渺茫，虚空，於是在人生的歧途上徬徨，徘徊着。我當時的情形，也就如此，失望，悲哀，顯然的我已墮入了痛苦之深淵了。</p>
<p>經了不少次的掙扎，我才從這個黑暗的深淵裏抬起頭來，望到了較光明的出路。那就是我明白了過去的錯誤，和今後當取的途徑。在現今物質做着重心的社會裏，一切人類的活動，都被牠的力量所支配和左右，戀愛當然也不能例外，這種唯心觀的戀愛，祗是文學中描寫的故事，而不能見之於現實的，我的失望，無非是理想　得太高，不適於實際的緣故。要免除痛苦，當從實際做去，不能爲漂渺的理想而徒耗精力。</p>
<p>講到人生，除了戀愛｜牠不過是人生的一角，而不能槪括其全部｜外，有着更廣大的意義，更重要的使命。人旣是社會的動物，是社會的一份子，應當各本天賦的能力，爲社會上大多數人服務。爲戀愛而失望，而消極，這不但對個人，而且也是對社會的損失。</p>
<p>現在，壓在我心頭的重重黑影｜失望，悲哀，消極｜一一的移去了。新的勇氣，新的精神，推着我向人生的道途上前進。</p>
<h3>日本婦女反對新税</h3>
<p>日本東京通訊</p>
<p>｜市政凈化聯盟底活動｜</p>
<p>在一般的［不景氣］之中，到處發現［赤字預算］，日本這個最大的都市東京，也免不了這個命運；照和九年度（今年）底債務，增加到驚人的鉅額，到達了九億日金的關口，因此弄得連頭都轉不動。市政當局，爲了彌縫這個破局，决定增設六項新税，預計由此可增收三百五十萬日金。對這六項新税中的［特别所得税］與［雇傭税］兩項，市以房枝女史等所參加的婦人市政凈化聯盟，從婦人底立塲出來反對。她們底理由是：特别所得税是想攫奪所得額六百日金而現在免了邀納國税的低薪生活者底荷包，雖爲赤字東京市底悲鳴之産物，亦是不能允許的。至於雇傭税，名義上雖説是雇傭税，而課税主體十一萬八千五百八十八人中，男的（當賬房，當差的）僅僅占着五千八百八十四人，實質上等於女傭税。無論對於雇傭女傭的家庭或女傭本身，這種新税都是不能允許的。例如夫婦都爲生活關係不得不找求職業以謀生的塲合，那末娘姨已經成爲生活上的必要，不是什麽奢侈人，如果因這次新税之課税而有不得不辭退女傭的主婦，就將使她從社會而回到家庭，這不悄説是婦人在社會上的一種损失。若從女傭本身來説，必將由這一新税而更受失業底威嚇，縱令不至失業，也必受到勞動强烈化與減低工資底苦痛。</p>
<p>這樣，她們堅持反對這兩個新税之增設，推舉代表訪問市政當局，要求撤消原議。而市政當局則另有意見，以爲：雇傭用人的家庭，大抵屬於有産階級，有負担相當賦税之能力。因此在税則上規定凡十六歳以下及六十歳以上，或患廢疾及臨時使用的看護婦等之外，槪需課以如下的税率。卽雇傭一人，年納五圓日金，二人則納七圓，三人十圓，四人十三圓，五人十六圓，六人二十圓，七人二十四圓，八人二十八圓，九人三十三圓，十人四十圓（以每一傭人爲單位計算），若使用十名以上，則每增一名應增二圓日金。預計每年可增收七十四萬六千九百二十三圓日金。</p>
<p>在窮困萬狀下度東京市看來，這確是一種很好的肥肉。因此頗有踢開婦人底反抗，而實施新税底氣槪。</p>
<h3>未來的女飛行家</h3>
<p>— 張直如</p>
<p>英屬馬來吉隆坡太平局紳王兆松君的女公子俏雲女士，近已加入吉隆坡飛行俱樂部爲一飛行會員，消息所播，不僅華僑婦女界爲之震驚；卽馬來亞各界人士也爲之贊歎非常。</p>
<p>女士爲吉隆坡僑生，現年二十，親母已死，六歳時，曾隨父北歸原藉　州，遊　香港之後。卽回南洋，十四歳卽畢業於吉隆坡之刊成高小，旋轉入美以美女子學校，現肄業第八班，勤奮力學，師長同學，都敬愛她。</p>
<p>王女士見華僑女子很少膽略作冒險之事，卽向家長要求學習航空術，當初家人極力反對，經過了很多曲折，很久時間，婉轉的，决斷的，眞誠摯意的繼續要求，始達目的，她現在於每日散課後，自駕私人汽車到飛機塲，隨飛機師紐華氏練習駕駛之術，她说等到將來技術諳練之後，將約集同志，組織商業郵航，聯絡中南航綫云。</p>
<h3>婦女們的話題</h3>
<p>— 獨步</p>
<p>英國女工之一例</p>
<p>不問東西古今、女人是被稱爲健談的。但究竟談些什麽，記者寡聞，不曾聽到有人做過精密的統計的研究，最近在外報上，看到載着關於這問題底科學的研究，不禁感到甚大的興味，爰爲譯述如次，以餉讀者。</p>
<p>該統計爲英國産業保健局最近的調查所製成的平均統計，被调查的對象爲英國的職業婦人，尤其是以勞動婦女爲中心的。研究底中心問題，爲她們在工作間究竟談論些什麽事情。調查期間爲五十四週，卽費去了一年的時光，且由科學的精密的調查質問所得到的。被調查的勞動婦底年齡，正是思春期的十五歳至十六歳的少女。</p>
<p>話題回數</p>
<p>關於異性的四十二回</p>
<p>關於電影及明星的二十七回</p>
<p>關於空談及醜聞的十四回</p>
<p>關於自殺，暗殺及事故傷害的十回</p>
<p>關於此外事情的十一回</p>
<p>關於就職狀態的三十七回</p>

<p>總計爲二百四十六回，其中可説以對於異性底興味與對於待遇底不平爲絶對多數。［食色性也］，孔老先生早已説過；同時，女人也是人，所以談話底中心，自然也是最普遍的人事爲主呵！</p>
<h3>歐洲的婚姻介紹</h3>
<p>— 熾</p>
<p>誠然婚姻並不是婦女的一個中心問題，然而從環境上及生理上説，婚姻問題實是婦女的重要問題之一。婦女因環境和傳統的關係，通常　有膽小的性情，怕羞的習慣，雖然在社會上女交際的機會很多，但爲了膽小和怕羞，時遇男常不易得到圓滿的自由戀愛，而且偶然的際不就是滿足的機緣，因此在歐洲各國每有一種介紹婚姻的機關，成立於大都市之中，這種機關，能使婦女對於婚姻問題之解决比較有凖確的把握，而易於達到男女自由戀愛的理想。</p>
<p>我國封建時代的婚姻，都操縱於父母之命，媒妁之言，直至今日，雖然因時代的變遷，自由變愛之風氣大開，然而媒人介紹制仍舊殘留於社會中，此外還因爲不澈底的自由，不正當的戀愛，發生了許多悲劇，受其流弊的，婦女比較多，所以婚姻介紹所的一種組織，也足以目之爲我國婦女問題之中所應當作爲參考的，現在將若干國家的例舉在後面：</p>
<p>英國有國家設立的婚姻介紹雜誌社，這種雜誌社所出的書籍都是討論婚姻問題所發行的雜誌，都有專家主筆如果有對於自己的婚姻問題疑難的地方，可以詢問解决方法。婚姻問題不得解决，擇偶没有標準，也可以拿自己的身世職業年齡面貌境性情等告知編者，由專家在雜誌上指示，雜誌社設有甲乙二種信箱，甲爲男性，乙爲女性，如欲求一異性，可以拿自，的一切刋載在雜誌上，書明所定信箱的號碼已異性認爲足以匹配的，時候自己投函通信，</p>
<p>德國有一種著名的婚姻報，上面亦完全討論婚姻問題，如果要求一配偶，可以拿自己的身世環境，和所要求的身世環境刋載在報紙上，自己的姓名住址告知報館，有人應徵可函寄報館，　名所刋廣告的號數，報館卽爲轉達，報館中對於通信者的姓名住址永守秘密，</p>
<p>法國亦有婚姻報，辦法和德國相類似。但婚姻報社有權檢查寄信人的眞相，以免流弊，收費雖大，但欺騙等事因得相當减少，至於意大利亦有這種類似的組織，因辦理不善，當生弊端，所以近年來此等組織，不甚發達。</p>
<h3>育兒與乳媽</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>國人因了生活水凖的低下，和衛生常識的缺乏，對於育兒問題素來無大關心。關於這一點，我們只要查看各地的嬰兒死亡率，就可相信了。</p>
<p>我國的嬰兒死亡率，雖然還没有精確的統計，但如以之與歐美比較，則其率高之驚人，是多數人所公認。</p>
<p>婴兒死亡率高的原因，説來很多。這裏所欲説的，則是乳媽的僱用問題：因爲僱用乳媽，是其中最重要的原因之一　　在從前，僱用乳媽這一件事，可説是没有的，卽有之，也不過是因嬰兒的親母的乳水不足，其鄰近或親戚中有足乳者臨時到來代餵，這是含有大家互相帮忙的性質，而並没帶有正式僱傭的意義　　僱用乳媽的現象，可説是在資本主義社會裏才會發生的。其原因是：一方面因了一般有産階級的太太奶奶們，爲了貪圖個人的寛閒，和顧全顔容的［漂亮］，對於自己的嬰兒之保育，乃不得不假手於他人：而乳媽的需求，就從此産生。另一方面，則因了農村的破産，在農村中過不得活的貧苦的婦女們，雖也有了她們親生的嬰兒，但爲了生活所迫，勢不得不出來傭奶：這是乳媽的供给，就由此而來。有了需要而又有了供给，怪不得僱用乳媽，在現社會裏，尤其是在都市中，就成爲一種風氣了。</p>
<p>本來，僱用乳媽，如由於做母親的乳汁之不足，或其職業上的牽制，那事屬不可非議；惟如因忙於交際而習於偷閒，以及迷信不以已乳餵兒乃是一種［置顔術，］那是十二分的不應該。我們做母親的當明白：僱用乳媽是一件萬不得已的事；不是到萬不得已時，切勿僱用乳媽。因爲根據一般的統計，嬰兒之犠牲在僱用乳媽上面，是着實令人可驚的　　僱用乳媽之爲害於嬰兒，可得而説者有四：</p>
<p>（一）乳質的不合宜親母的乳汁，與嬰兒的身體有着天然的關係，是很適宜的。惟乳媽的則不然。乳媽因爲産期遲早的，關係，或乳汁濃度不同，嬰兒飲之，常有意外之慮。</p>
<p>（二）育兒常識和情感的缺乏乳媽大都出自鄉村貧苦的農户，因他們的生活簡陋，旣不知道講衛生，亦缺乏育兒常識。所以對於嬰兒的吃，衣，玩各事，不知合理的指道，影響於嬰兒的身體與習慣，實非淺鮮，</p>
<p>（三）傳染疾病的危險不幸僱用乳媽而遭逢着帶有疥癬，砂眼，肺癆，梅毒等傳染病者，那不待説，婴兒是必被其傳染的。</p>
<p>這樣看來，乳媽非萬不得已，則以不僱爲佳。</p>
<p>然而在事實方面説，當現社會制度未根本地變革以前，這種乳媽僱傭的現象，是無法消滅的。目前爲治標計，爲免除嬰兒患病及夭折計，我們只好在選擇乳媽上面着想：</p>
<p>（一）乳媽的第一條件，必需身體健康，尤其是必須没有砂眼，肺癆，梅毒等傳染病的嫌疑。關於這一點，最好是請醫生代爲檢騐。</p>
<p>（二）乳媽的産期，與自己的嬰兒出生的日子，距離不可過遠；最好只在兩個月間。</p>
<p>（三）乳媽的心地必須仁慈，而其性情又須温和。燥暴而無責任心者不可用。</p>
<p>（四）乳媽個人須素重清潔，尤須略有育兒的衛生常識（只要她是有責任心的，這點可由嬰兒的親母日常詳爲指示。）</p>

<p>昨據外電、倫敦大條、近遠俱平、美銀縮一二五、英對美長一分、美對英升一分、英對法漲三十磅音、美對法縮一分二五、遠期銀價微縮、倫敦生金漲五便士、私電銀價勿動、匯兌長七五、匯市晨開近期賣價、英匯一先令四便士一八七五、美匯三十四元七五、較之前收、計英平而美緊零六二五、開後廣帮供給、趨勢硬化、然滙豐掛牌揭曉、英美咸平、一度平平、後因銀行胃口不振而　硬、最後成交沉寂、形勢更呆、延至午收、近期賣價英滙一先令四便士一八七五、美滙三十四元八一二五、較之前收、英美俱無上落、半天間雖有報載徵銀税、及日本購買純金等訊、但細味之下、尚無特殊變化、華商供給之下、匯市遂難緊臻、華商約塞美滙二十餘萬元、今將半天成交錄後、</p>
<p>英滙晨開近期賣價一先令四便士一八七五、半天交易不多、三井售予沙遜六七月份對　三一二五、午　賣價自一先令四便士一八七五起至四三七五、進價照加零六二五、</p>

<p>洋拆仍無變動</p>
<p>昨日市塲洋拆依然勿動、早午兩市俱開五分、與前日相同、劃頭初無加水、後開二三分、市氣大槪清淡、拆票交易早市轉賬四百萬弱、新交易五十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易六十餘萬、銀行收解外商銀行因值週末、下午例假、市氣與收解當然尤較平時岑寂、計收解票欵一百十餘萬、各種貨滙押墊雜欵收解三百六七十萬、出倉三十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百二十餘萬、各種貨匯税押雜欵收解三百八十餘萬、出倉二十萬、日商銀行收解票欵一百四五十萬、各種貨匯雜欵收解二百十餘萬、出倉三十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千九百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百二十餘萬、各路匯欵五十餘萬、收現五六十萬、洋押欵交易一百三十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百三十餘萬、客路來去胃五十五萬、又本市票據交换所七日交换總數、銀元五百五十九萬八千一百五十六元二角六分、内計銀元二百五十八萬八千五百六十七元六角二分、匯劃銀元三百萬零零九千五百八十八元六角四分、</p>

<p>昨日江南小洋、早午兩市仍同爲八百三十四元五角、較前日改小五角、做出交易、早市九千角午市二千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲七百五十五元五角、午市爲七百五十五元、兩市改小五角做出交易、早市七萬五千萬角、午市三萬角、銅元改長二千文、爲三百二十三千文、交易三萬一千三百三十一千文、計代價洋九千七百元、</p>
<p>上月存息仍開二元</p>
<p>三月份因洋拆白借居多、故全月祗有數錢總額、此届存息議案結果價仍爲二元九五扣、欠息照舊四元五角、坐盤遞加之、</p>
<h3>證劵紐約股市漲多跌少</h3>
<p>新豐洋行據華爾街日報報告昨日市况云、昨股市仍未脱盤旋狀態、先因交易所當局調查十五種股票之被投機家操縱、晨初參差不齊、後因鐵道股有力、而范史完令勤系各股尤形挺秀、遂轉堅定、小交易所賣出稍多、市况略疲、債劵具投機性者仍勁、外國公債稍見進步、又據本行代理人報告云、（證劵）末後在鐵道股領導下回漲、以將續高、（小麥）異常呆滯、華盛頓消息無色、但未破落、切勿放空、（棉花）因同業買進、五月期限定價格、及預測朋克海案有早日表决而漲、紗廠需要不日或有進步、人心混亂、惟看高者居多、一週内廠方吸收共二二九、○○○包、全日成交一百○一萬股、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>紗花似乎靜定之標紗花</h3>
<p>紗市平疲、形勢仍屬趨向軟化、但實需尚堪維持、仍以南方購辦爲多、惟行情不動、足見市面之凋敝矣、廠方亦無舉動、故一般散户均傾向空頭、市盤一漲、賣風卽起、總之存紗太厚、壓力甚重、</p>
<p>標紗平凡</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、市况尚好、以美棉回漲、塲中買户缺乏、各月漲一角、午後開拍、市氣較昂、拍至三收盤時又轉下游、各月跌一角、全日成交統計一萬七千包、查賣出源大九百五十包、明德四百包、長餘四百包、愼記六百包、大昶四百五十包、永昌四百包、信誠七百包、買進仁豐一千零五十包、椿記五百包、恒益六百五十包、大豐三百包、元泰九百包、泰昌六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>廣東一三○江西一五北帮一○</p>
<p>棉市晨漲午跌、美棉微漲、印棉暗盤又漲、故人心略爲激動、惟紗市積重難返、廠方對於原料一層、進意較滯、因之源大號逢漲有大量的抛賣、總之大勢惡劣、且花價較紗價爲高、新買者仍缺耳、</p>

<p>標花前市開盤、隨外棉向上、各月漲五分至二角、午後多頭了結、各月又跌五分至二角、全日成交統計五萬八千担、查賣出源大四千二百担、大豐二千四百担、裕康三千四百担、大孚一千担、恒益一千四百担、長餘一千一百担、永昌一千担、長豐三千六百担、源興昌一千四百担、買進恒益一千一百担、長豐二千五百担、源興昌二千四百担、長和三千九百担、同孚一千二百担、賡豐一千二百担、愼昌一千三百担德記一千五百担、益豐一千二百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉因抵定回漲</h3>
<p>昨日美棉市况、始因外商賣出而跌、後以現貨商買進及空頭抵補回漲、結果現貨漲十磅音、期貨漲一磅音至十一磅音、利物浦棉現貨跌四點、期貨跌二點、埃及棉現貨不動、孟買棉市、因多頭了結而跌、結果平加爾奥姆辣均跌二羅比二角半、白羅溪跌二羅比半、原電錄左、（六日電）</p>

<h3>美棉靜待彭案之最後發展</h3>
<p>紐約六日來電、報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市平靜、均待彭海氏提案之最後發展、以及其他剌激也、本週内曾由最低價回起四十個磅音、卽有少數南方賣出及多頭了結、價格遂又反動、且有若干套賣、以抗外棉者、惟其壓力不巨、現貨需要仍滯、但基礎價穏、日本買進近期、與遠東有關係者則有買進新花之訊、本季第一週之氣候報告、塔克　斯及南喬治亞進行均屬良好、惟中部及本部棉帶有若干地方尚未完成耳、原棉雖形不定、但棉布市况、則較有起色云、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>北洋暢辦現粉</p>
<p>標粉新囤户蠭起</p>
<p>昨日粉市、形勢甚佳、因連日北洋暢銷現粉、市上所存下脚粉已被盡數裝出、共計達二十萬包之鉅、近日胃口仍佳、且有注意近期標凖、客化旣活、各廠又復　守不出、人心一致看好、又引起新囤與補空交易、本月份以現粉活潑、更見挺俏、收市漲一分七五、九月漲一分二五、五七月各大七五、六八月各大半分、</p>
<p>洋貨到埠</p>
<p>期貨挫落三分</p>
<p>昨日麥市、洋麥徵小、期麥有行販抛套、市亦趨軟、人心亦虚、因有洋麥定貨到申、且尚有美麥續借之議、開市後各月份均見下游、收市價四月小三分、六月小三分、七八月各小一分、現麥存到兩足、廠化亦活、昨日福新申大等辦去六千三百包、山東等高麥三元五角七分、頴州高郵等三元半、中次照降、市居站局、</p>
<h3>晚稻米高定中削</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源　湧、計八十餘號、（八千餘石）、其中以晚稻較夥、厚粳及各花色均占半數、晚稻去路亦轉暢、初市起南洋厦門福州等帮出手採取、而北洋帮尤濃直至收市、共納青角松泗西練　涇等貨二千四五百包、惟客家因見貨湧、選剔非常嚴格、高貨稍取、對於中次貨有模稜兩可之象、吃盤問題因之遂難放鬆、幸售方相持、始呈高定中貶之局、如青角松泗等價站定、楓涇西練等價略修二三分、常帮蘇同南港等粳、乃城鄉店胃轉强、因成到销兩平之局、惟以剩貨尚有、大勢略帶軟色、而行情悉無榮辱、仍守老盤、杜洋尖定局、變陰元去路忽旺、市氣因轉起解許、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到船十八九號、市銷因斛師問題、現尚未完全解决、故同行開斛甚稀、賣買方少數上市、做開稀少、市形各色堅挺、</p>
<p>客秈到銷兩活</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、新有湖機米等絡續到申、沙市皂市及江北安徽各屬亦有裝到、故雖有本客暢辦、市面仍得扯平、到頭以市路零星居多、湖南米近以申價上漲見划、亦有逐次裝出、惟江西有當地軍民大額需要、在早米未出新前或難湧到、卽今年所到之江西米均係去年辦存待裝之貨、新辦則難通划矣、昨市仍以福州最貪、計辦去湖南米四百包、江西米一百十包、江北南京滁州無錫各米一千三百四十九包、皂市沙市糙米六百六十七包、本街去湖南機靖一千二百包、行情均與前市相近、後形仍居站勢、</p>
<h3>洋莊菜籽做開一批</h3>
<p>黃豆依然乏站立性</p>
<p>菜籽交易、大多在暗中進行、所以缺乏實情、市况平疲而已、刻下存底尚有平湖貨四五萬包、性質大半固定、市價不易過修、昨市聞有一千包平湖貨成交、價爲四兩二錢半、照舊規計算、尚有二錢之市、但未確悉、黃豆趨勢依然難立、來源雖少、然去路落淡、昨統市成交六車、致人心不免虚弱、市復下跌二三分、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>津青帮採辦雨衣布</p>
<p>呢絨零躉交易昨仍旺盛、雨衣布市盤稍堅、尤以單面開水美更挺、蓋有青島天津二帮搜辦之故也、元藏顔色尤爲俏活、昨同業中售開厚薄雨衣布十四箱、計天津帮購進九箱、青島帮五箱、内單面開水美占十一箱、象皮　元常藍灰薄貨祇有三箱寗豐現貨怡康昌記俱有開出、掮客轉手者有七箱、四○二六正頭號成交價五元二角半凈盤、二二二五作四元算封后圖象皮薄雨衣布成交價三元二角半、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>華絲謀對外發展</p>
<p>江浙兩省絲廠業、近以華絲滯銷、純由推銷方面無完善組織、致國外城要時、華絲無處可購、認爲非組織大規模生絲對外貿易機關、不能挽救目前危局、故特建議實業部、於上海設立推销總事務所、里昂紐約分設推銷辦事處、隨時察酌法美絲銷狀况、市價情形、向江浙兩省各絲廠認定廠絲、運往直接銷售、</p>

<h3>上海工部局有華董的經過</h3>
<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>上次記者曾爲文討論此次上海市政選舉問題，那篇文字的主旨祇在説明市民對於市政選舉應當十分注意，切不可等閒視之，以冀促進市民之參政興趣而已。現在再將上海公共租界市政組織（卽工部局，其英名爲shangbaemunicepalcouncil蓋卽［上海市政府］也）之緣起及國人加入工部局爲董事之經過簡單地加以叙述，使一般人知道工部局何以有華董，及吾人對於上海市政應作若何之努力。</p>
<p>上海之闢爲租界，係根據一八四三年南京條約，而南京條約又是我國在鴉片戰爭後與英國訂立的城下之盟，這是大家都知道的，無庸詳述。但是上海工部局却不是租界成立之後馬上就有，它是經歷許多次蜕化的過程　形成現在這種組織的。當初一八四五年的地産章程的目的不過説明中英人民地産之關係，毫無市政組織之規定也。所以當時租界上之市政，及各國僑民之管理還是由各國領事分别負責，在該項章程内僅規定［英國領事得委任公正商人組織一［道路碼頭委員會］而已。後來太平天國革命，國人逃難至租界者日衆，而各國僑民又恐受到此次戰爭之擾亂，外僑均感覺到無統一組織之危險，於是遂有一八五四年之修正地産章程，在這章程裏纔有市政組織之規定，這就是現在工部局之最初組織。但是這種組織的權力，當時也不過是有徵税及警察權力而已，實非一眞正之市政，眞正市政府之完成，還是後來逐漸演變的結果。本文爲要説明華人代表問題，故但述工部局之起源，至於它的演化過程因無討論之必要，置之不論。</p>
<p>在一八六六年外僑納税人通過的地産章程中，有華人代表原則，但迄未實行。其没有實行之故，費唐報告書中以爲到如今還没有人知道，不過他雖没有説明原因，有兩句話却是值得注意的。他説：［就另一方面論，一八六六年所提之建議，衡之當日實際情形或嫌爲時太早。蓋當時欲物色租界内一二領袖華人，願意負責担任這顧問委員會委員者，或不易得。·····一九○六年以前，公共租界之華人亦未嘗明白要求］。據此，則市政完全歸外人龔斷者實是我國人自己不好，忽略權利不去過問之故。而後來西人鑒於華人之易與，對我們的一切要求不加重視，其原因也是爲此。</p>
<p>現在將我國人要求加入代表之經過，分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）一九○六年，國人根據前項章程向工部局提出要求，希望工部局容納華方意見，聘華人爲顧問。此次要求之由來是因爲當時有所謂［會審公廨暴動］。這暴動何以會發生呢？據費唐謂是起因于工部局與中國官廳之爭執，但中外官廳之爭執，何以會使［暴徒］暴動呢？這點費唐雖絲毫没有提到，我們却可想像到這一定是另有原因的。但是這次要求由各業公所董事開會一致贊同，所提出之華商顧問委員會［純在代表華人商界］，和［代表公共租界内之華人銀行及商業利益］，並非是爲一般民衆享受市政利益着想。不過，就是這種要求，仍經外僑納税會否决，結果未能實行。</p>
<p>（二）第二次正式提議，于一九一五年提出，卽爲當時領事國與中國當道所討論之推廣公共租界草約内所載條件之一。其要點爲［以聘用顧問爲圓滿辦法］，並非增加華董。工部局並鄭重聲明：［其所以承認者爲解除其屢見之困難而非爲華人之干涉租界行政］。但此種要求雖經外僑納税會接受，事實上仍未施行。</p>
<p>（三）一九二年因增加市税，發生騷動，故各路商界聯合會有請求工會有请求工部局加入華人代表之要求。當時工部局雖贊成顧問制度，但極力反對加入華董，因爲他們的意見是：［就事實而論，華人之居于此地殆可謂係由于寛容，並無要求參加吾儕行政之法律上權利也。］事經總董致書領袖領事，並由外僑納税會之批准，得正式成立，不過這會建樹和成績是絲毫没有的。</p>
<p>（四）一九二五年五卅慘案，反帝國主義風潮高漲，外人受此威脅，遂承認增加華董三人之要求。但因名額之爭執，遷延二年，華董始正式就職。</p>
<p>（五）一九三○年華董席數增至五人。此時董事共十四人，外人九人。</p>
<p>综上所述，有三點是我們所應深切的認識與覺悟的，就是（一）西人之允許華人加入工部局，完全是從他們辦事方便上着想，並非是根據民治原則，或者是承認華人之權利，他們是因爲租界居民大部份是華人，華人納税佔工部局税收之百分五十五以上；</p>
<p>（二）西人所以不容納華人要求，是因爲華人自己放棄權利，而要求者又祇是少數人；</p>
<p>（三）祇有民衆圑結起來，堅决要求，纔能使西人降心相從，主張民族復興，民主政治的先生們，均要能不忽略這一點，方可有爲。</p>

<h3>［長工錢，一筒烟！］</h3>
<p>— 王希哲</p>
<p>吾鄉｜宜興，江南各縣大抵相同｜的長工的分四種：放牛的呌小伙計，精力發育半成熟的呌槽頭伙計，年輕力壯的是正式長工，老弱疾病的在殘兵之列。其中的長工是種田的主力軍。</p>
<p>長工的一年薪水是從二十一二元到二十七八元，老板不能親身下田的人家，才雇一個三十元一年的作頭伙計，代替老板盡監督的職務，這多半是由老板的親戚或姪子外甥等充任的。</p>
<p>長工的一年工作是農忙時天没亮下田，夜晚了摸索着農具回來，病上三天就得找代工，由長工出錢。田事尚未開始或已完了時，得往市鎭載糞，上山　柴，下河取泥，摇船，推車，　　　　牛棚裏織草貨，編竹物，打　和　　　。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　下工，其餘的休息日子是很有限的。至于長工的苦處，如春夏與黃梅天的風與水，夏秋的日炙暑蒸，秋冬的風凌雪壓等，是我的筆所描寫不出的。</p>
<p>長工與老板的結合和待遇是這樣：冬至節前後，在村或鎭的早茶館裏，由第三者做中人介紹兩方講工。说定工價後，長工就得　請老板與中人，到明年正月初五老板設一席豐富的酒菜请所有的長工與中人，這呌拴鼻酒，意思是像耕牛樣的用繩子拴住了鼻孔，就得埋頭做下去，遇到仰頭或歪尾巴的當兒，那末老板的鞭子是隨時可以打的，直到臘月廿四給老板預備好一切過年食物的那晚，吃了一些米粉素圑子像野狗似地挾着尾巴離開老板的家。其中週年所吃的是每天三頓，早上白粥，中午飯，晚上菜，芋或山薯粥，粗米圑子，條頭麫等。農忙時午後有送到田埂上來的油煎餅及燒酒外，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　氣大的倒常有得吃的。</p>
<p>長工的支取工錢與例假是這樣：在講定工價與請過老板及中人後，可以預支四分之一的工錢，以後在正月半，二月八，插秧完了的後一天，六月廿三，七月半，九月十三，等休息的日子，每次可以支半塊錢到街上去玩一天，喝喝老酒外，歸來的時候還得買些吃物送給小老板，算是答谢老板娘曾給他補過幾次破衣服。其餘的錢，就全花在一桿黃烟棒上了。今天老板上街時代買一百文黃烟，一包洋火，過一天又是這一百三十文，老板上了賬，加起來，秋風才起的時候，早就在工資以外，欠了老板的黃烟帳了。于是只得額外勤快地做工，希望在講工前就取得預塡黃烟錢來反明天的工資抵押。這樣，做了一生長工的，没法子討一個老婆來傳代，有過老婆的把小小兒子帶到東家來放牛，老婆則住上海進廠，進薦頭行。没有老婆的呢，到中年以後，眼看着自己咳嗽，駝背了，于是發誓抛了烟竿，戒絶黃烟，和相當的寡婦姘姘，生得一男半女來代替自己做長工。抛戒不掉烟癮的呢，老了，病了，悄悄地死在村畔的破廟裏。這是，在爭插萬顆一行的長直的秧田裏，在競踏九人一軸的高急的水車垜上，曾被同輩與老板稱譽，算是拿過大工錢，抽過大筒烟的長工的一生呵！</p>
<p>［作孽錢，一篷烟（意卽被［天火］燒）；商業錢，三十年：種田錢，萬萬年。］｜這是農民樂天安命的封建意識之實足表現。可是，［長工錢］，又只抵值［一筒烟］呵！</p>
<p>［廿三圑子廿四飯（臘月廿三送灶用米粉圑子，廿四用飯），長工吃得快滾蛋！門角落裏一把破雨傘，户　底下兩隻漏釘鞋，長工挾了就滾蛋。大老板呌小老板，給他三扁担，長工打得跌脚板一路哭哇哇！抛了雨傘，掉下釘鞋，老板娘拿來换糖騙娃娃。］｜這首每到年底，小老板們常唱的兒歌，我小時也老對着一般長工們唱過千百遍的歌，我今天才感到牠的澀味。</p>
<h3>陰山</h3>
<p>— 包黑</p>
<p>貸棧裏。</p>
<p>大木箱，桶子，鋼鐵條，繭包｜一大堆，一大堆，高高的。</p>
<p>没有窗，風打鉛皮屋縫裏竄進來，［嘘嘘·····］地呌着。</p>
<p>雖在晴天，外邊有太陽，這兒可依舊在十五支osram的光圈下工作着。失去了自然的地方哪！永遠是慘黯的。</p>
<p>四五層，高大的洋樓，可没有柚木板壁，花紗玻璃窗，上臘地板，没有，一些漂亮的裝璜都没有。這兒，祗是水門汀地，白粉砂牆，粗糙得擦痛皮膚的大柱子。這兒，老那麽砌疊着大堆的貨物，這邊，那邊，空間矗起貨堆的輪廓，黑漆漆的。</p>
<p>這兒，老那麽陰氣森森。</p>
<p>［陰山哪！］大夥兒稱呼着。</p>
<p>大夥兒便在陰山裏生活着，呼吸着惡濁的氣息，嗅覺着腥臭味。空氣一直是窒塞的，説過啦，這兒没有窗洞。</p>
<p>陰濕得難過的時候，就想踱出走廊來，就想點着一枝烟捲兒，可是，立刻，那地紅底白字［禁止吸烟］的琺瑯牌便映進了眼簾，似乎每個字裏都瞪着一顆威嚴的眼珠子。</p>
<p>威嚴的眼珠子，有時會在一些高貴商人的臉上發現。</p>

<h3>時事研究</h3>
<h3>華北危機四伏</h3>
<p>— 非黎</p>
<p>自去年六月間的［塘沽停戰恊定］成立以後，危急萬分的華北形勢，已漸漸地轉爲和緩，而中日兩國也獲得了暫時的所謂相互諒解。於是全國的同胞們對於日本帝國主義所經常覬　着的華北，便不再加以十分注意，以爲那兒有萬里長城作了屏障，從此以後是可以高枕無憂地過太平日子了。然而事實所告訴我們的却並不其然！</p>
<p>現在，我們還用不着去翻閲數月以來的歷史，就將最近幾天之内的華北事象，以及中央要人視察華北後的談話，作一個槪要的統計，便可以得出下列的一些可怕的事項：</p>
<p>秦皇島日韓浪人活動。（三月二十七日申報天津電）</p>
<p>日軍到遵化調查户口。（三月三十日大美晚報北平電）</p>
<p>殷汝耕談馬蘭峪接收無期。（三月三十日申報北平電）</p>
<p>顔惠慶氏抵滬時語記者：［本人此次赴平津料理私務，並沿途視察華北情形，深覺華北形勢之危急，尤盼全國上下一致注意者也。］（三月三十日大美晚報）</p>
<p>唐山，　縣，昌黎，喜峯口，馬蘭峪各地日軍及守備隊實行實彈野戰演習。（三月三十一日申報北平電）</p>
<p>馬蘭峪鎭一帶日住有重兵及飛機多架，並建築飛機塲。（四月一日申報南京電）</p>
<p>馬蘭峪日僞增兵。（四月一日大美晚報天津電）</p>
<p>東一帶日人售賣鴉片嗎啡等毒物。（四月一日申報北平電）</p>
<p>中委張　於　察華北後返京時語記者：［　　華北危機四伏，北平大有朝不保夕之虞，與東北九一八前夜形勢相似，誠吾人作亡國奴之日已在眼前，言　　　　　　　　　　　　　京電）</p>
<p>日軍主力集中熱西。｜｜作者按：三月二十九日大晚報載，熱省長城各口現住日軍約一萬三千餘人｜｜（四月二日申報北平專電）</p>
<p>滿鐵東亞經濟調查會派專員調查華北經濟情形，並擬在北平，天津，青島，濟南，太原等地設立特别機關，以謀開發其資源。（四月二日申報華聯電）</p>
<p>榆關電局仍由日軍把持。（申報天津電）</p>
<p>日飛機威脅豐潤縣。（四月三日大晚報天津電）</p>
<p>［古北口近日軍又增四百，又前昨二日，有日軍兩批，經古轉察邊，日方現正趕修白馬關等口汽車路。］（四月三日大晚報北平電）</p>
<p>日僞積極建築熱省及長城各口間的鐵路（平原赤峯間，凌源冷口間等），及軍用汽車道路（朝陽赤峯間，赤峯承德間等）。｜｜（四月三日申報長春通信）</p>
<p>由上面這許多的事象分析起來，很明顯地可以認識清楚，日本帝國主義者是在應用着怎樣的方法來向華北進攻：一，武力侵佔：二，利用漢奸與日韓浪人搗亂：三，派員入内地考查：四，出售毒物遺害華人。因此，我華北廣大的領土和數千萬的民衆，便在這四條毒辣的侵略政策之下日趨於危急了。</p>
<p>［華北異常危急了！］這一句微弱的呼聲，也有幾個人在呌了，然而這呼聲畢竟是有些微弱，竟還未震動這老大的中華民衆的耳鼓，唤起了他們的注意。在另一方面，也還没有聽到政府所取的態度與對付的方針，只聞目下黃郛南下，［實負有與京中最高當局接洽某種外交要務之性質。］這的確是令人難於明晰的事。</p>
<p>四月四日東京電稱：［日本無侵略中國之意，觀最近關東軍之態度可以斷定。我國之要　應正確認識華北之現狀，謀增進民衆之富履，不可以動摇人心之言（作者按：卽指中委張繼視察華北後的談話），向外宣傳。］這一段日本帝國主義者的虚僞的辯護文，惟希黨國諸公别爲所惑，同時也望全國民衆别爲所惑，必要對於華北｜甚而至於全國　加以嚴密的　衛。如果萬一不　，戰　再臨於華北，則惟有望全國民衆快快圑結起來，　一個爲求中國民衆的生存的自衛的　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　小精悍的抵抗！</p>

<p>在堆棧裏也有職員｜［棧房先生］。</p>
<p>嘿嘿！亦該有這樣一個好聽的名兒？還不是一樣的苦，得跟着大夥兒在貨堆裏攢進攢出，翻箱，翻桶：：：爬到堆頂，爬進牆角，在狹的夾縱中，在暗的隧道裏，傴着身子，用電筒去照每件貨物上的Ｍark···No···Weigbt···拉直着嗓子呌喊，讓大商人的隨員記錄。</p>
<p>有些時候，額骨撞在箱子角上，胳膊，腿，呌釘子給扯破，淌血，堆棧裏打不到止血的東西，抓把門角灰，拉一　　蜘網扱上，這便是好法兒。</p>
<p>熱天，堆棧裏没有冷氣，没有風扇，職員，小工赤膊，出一層汗，塗一層灰沙，在霉臭的氣味中喘着，喘着。冷天，　棧裏没有水汀，寒氣打水門汀地冒出，職員縮着身子儘抖，熬不住冷的時候便跳。小工們却還挨得過，他們常常會被幾千磅重的貨件壓出一身汗來。</p>
<h3>略談［鷄生蛋蛋生鷄］的問題</h3>
<p>— 克士</p>
<p>讀業餘周刋六十七期持佛先生的［鷄生蛋乎蛋生鷄乎廣義］之後，我也覺得有幾句话要説。</p>
<p>這個問題表面上雖似簡單，實際上却很複雜的。它曾經作爲一個遺傳學上的中心問題而被討論着。遺傳上首先要明白的是：身體由生殖　發生的呢，還是生殖質是由身體産生的？對於這，古人費了許多心思，立下了若干假設，但重要的约有以下的二派：</p>
<p>（一）主張［蛋是鷄産生的］。這派可以達爾文爲代表。達爾文曾立下一個假設，假定動物體的各細胞能散出一種超顯微鏡的微分子，稱爲［微芽］。據説這微芽進入血液後，由它帶到生殖細胞裏，貯蓄起來了。後來那生殖細胞發育爲新個體，因此便和親體相像的。</p>
<p>（二）主張［鷄是蛋生的］。這派可以威土孟爲代表。威士孟曾立下一個學説，</p>
<p>说明生殖細胞的生殖形質是由前代的生殖形質傳來，並不是由個體産生出來的，所以生殖形質前後一系相承，身體的細胞却由生殖形質所産生。他是這樣的建設了他的［種形質連續説］。</p>
<p>這兩派理論不特在遺傳學上很重要，在變異説和進化論上也極重要的。如果照達爾文的假設講，倘使個體一生中受了環境的影響而發生效果，也能够傳到生殖形質而使後代發生變異。如果照威士孟的學説講，只有生殖形質自身發生變異，才能傳之後代，個體環境的影響是不能及於生殖形質的。終於因爲科學看重證明之故，達爾文所説的微芽無法證明，威士孟的學説却在顯微鏡下找到了一部分的證據，因此有不少生物學家擁護了威士孟的學説。持佛先生主張蛋先於鷄，也許可以説是屬於威士孟一派的意見的。</p>
<p>然而我們如分析觀察之外再加以综合的看，雖然許多遺傳性質是似能直接遺傳：有些變異的新種好像能獨自發生出來，｜｜因爲原因不明，好像由於生殖形質的變異而發現於子息。但從别一方面看，因了生活環境的影響而使生物發生變異，發生進化的例子確實很多。譬如人類的由來這個問題，進化論者的解釋是：先有像猿猴類的生物，生活於樹上：由這種生活習得能坐，能直立的體制。並且把兩手解放出來了，能用以攀緣樹枝，摘取果實。等到森林衰落，它們遂降落到地上後，於是能勉强用兩足行走，並且更學習了用手把握木杖和施用工具。直立的姿勢和新的環境助長腦的發達，腦的發達也同時助長了作工的技能。從這等例子看來，變異和進化，與個體的生活狀况實有關係，單歸因於生殖形質的發生變化，是很難说明的。因此，我們很可以説鷄的生活能影響於蛋，蛋把這影響再傳之於鷄。前幾年康凱司德提出近代生物學者有把生物作整個的看的傾向；湯姆遜更説明生物當和環境連帶的觀察的意見，這大槪由於這等事實而發的吧？</p>
<p>現在把空論搁起，再説到本題。持佛先生以爲有鷄必先有蛋，這固不失爲一派生物學家的意見，但引羅廣庭博士的［自然發生説］作證，實在錯誤之至。羅博士的话之不可靠，用不着我來多説，只要看了嶺南大學的Ｈartman，巴斯德學院的Ｈoarepoeue的信（大陸雜誌二卷五期），和幾位國内科學家的討論可以知道。至於（雀入大海爲蛤］，［羊可種］一類的話，不單不是常，並且也不是常識，只是如郝懿行所説［古人察物未精，妄爲洲量］的話，倘使今日還有人相信，那眞糟糕極了。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>結婚與民族</h3>
<p>— 寒影</p>
<p>只要我們肯留心社會瑣聞，時常都可以發覺一些和社會問題極有關係的事實。约十幾天前，在一個［結婚二年目的未達］的標題之下，我們又看到了這樣的一　情節：孫秀娥與孫裕生結婚兩年有餘，雖同居一室，未經一　交歡，近延律師訴孫裕生係屬天　，請求離異，而孫裕生自謂因肺病停止房事，實非染有暗疾，亦聘律師聲請調解云。</p>
<p>结婚與健康，兩者關係非常密切。男女的配合，本屬一種天性：除非是生理上有何殘缺，誰都有此需要。但一個人要結婚，也須具備有一種結婚的條件；缺乏了這種條件，便没有結婚的資格。這在歐美各國，早已規訂在婚姻法律上。當一個人要結婚的時候，必要經過醫師的一度檢騐，證明其身體發育已達成熟而無缺陷，然後國家才應許結婚；反之，若身體發育未全，或有難治的疾病，便得不到結婚的權利。這於少數人固然有損失，但於大部分人則甚有益。這不但關係於個人或家庭的幸福；於國家，民族，推廣之而至於全體人類的影響，亦十分重大。</p>
<p>可是我國就不然了。我國人要結婚，非常自由，百般方便。無論男子或女子，只要自己願意結婚，或父母要他們成婚，他們立刻就可以實行了。至若年齡是否已達成人，身體發育是否完全，是否患有傳染病，遺傳病或暗疾，便可以一切不管。不但自己不管，卽國家也不來干涉。因此我國的婚姻情形，就有着各種各樣的奇異現象。［父母之命，媒妁之言，］總算是最合規條的；指腹爲婚或童養媳，亦幾成風習。他們對於結婚　　［爲結婚而結婚］的主旨，絲毫没有顧到男女雙方現在或將來身體的健康狀態是否已達到或可以逹到一個結婚程度和資格。十三四歳的小夫婦會製造出小國民，四方傳爲佳話：臥病沉重，甚而至於一息奄奄，體温將發散的兒子，爲父母者，有時也要設法替他抬一位新娘子來冲冲喜，以望其能起死回生。有些身染性病的男子，且因爲迷信和處女交媾可以解除痛苦而結婚。遺傳症更屬潛而不易見，卽使眞能遺傳，那也是後一代的事情了，亦不能作爲我們結婚的障碍物。豈但舊式婚姻如此，卽現時的自由戀愛結婚，還不是一樣嗎？他們有的沉迷於一時的熱情，也就顧不了其他；有的則爲金錢或美色所誘惑，那管什麽健康不健康。總之，我國人的結婚是太自由，太隨便了。孫秀娥與孫裕生的結合，並不算得是如何奇特。</p>
<p>依我們看來，健康不但與結婚有關係，健康甚至是結婚諸條件中一個最重要的條件。須知兩性的結合，除了互助和滿足性生活而外，還負有一個繁殖種族的使命。所謂繁殖種族，不單是生子傳孫就算了，還要注意到種族的改善，使自己的種族能够向上發展。這卽是近代優生學給與我們的教訓。故一個人要結婚，應待身體發育成熟，又無缺陷，才可實行；若没有具備一種結婚的資格，貿然試之，不僅自己得不到幸福，於種族也遺害非淺。爲個人和家庭的幸福着想，爲社會國家和民族的前途着想，此後我國人要結婚，應改變一向草率從事的態度，對男女雙方的健康條件，應加以深切的注意。至政府方面，於這一問題，更不可漠視；一方在教育上，可利用教育的工具，極力作有效的宣傳，使結婚知識和優生學説，能充分普及民間；他方在法律上，應有一種限制婚姻的規定，俾國民不敢視婚姻如兒戲。那末，將來關於婚姻上所發生的不幸事件，或可因而稍减；這於國家民族的發展，亦不無若干裨益！</p>
<h3>職業教育現在與將來</h3>
<p>— 紀辛</p>
<p>［目前中國教育最急迫需要者，應極力謀職業教育之發展。］這是國際勞工局副局長莫維德貢獻教育部的話。</p>
<p>職業教育，這個名字本身就有許多問題。但對這方面我並不想討論，只想分析職業二字所指的教育狀况：牠走的是怎樣的路徑？對社會發生什麽影響？及其今後的動向。</p>
<p>（一）職業教育與商業教育！職業教育如果是辦得有成績的話，就是商業教育，牠算得是一個時代的　兒。在大學設有商學院或商科，高級中學有商科，有的師範學校附設商科職業班，更有獨立的商業學校。論學生的出路，常是較好於其他各科學生，甚至好於師範學校的畢業生。這現象，如同近年的銀行業一樣，是一種畸形的發展。商科學生的出路好，銀行及其他類似商業的發達，都市顯得繁榮，農村却已枯竭，成爲一個龐大的　肚皮。這不是可喜的現象，而是悲慘的　兆。他們並不是直接生産者。在目前中國，是一種不需要的消费。這種消費的職業教育發達一天，從事其他職業的財力就會薄弱。假如學校訓練的人才與社會事業，發生供過於求的現象，那就等於普通性質的學校，只是造就出高等遊民，失業的後備軍。卽使能够供求相應的話，那也是等於自掘墳墓罷了。</p>
<p>（二）職業教育與輕工業｜在各級學校中，職業教育是樣樣具備的。工科，農科，商科，更有獨立的職業學校。大學且不説他，至於中等職業學校，大多是開設紡織，洗染，銀行，會計，工藝等科。機械工業，農業等科，雖然也有關設的，但求其名實相符，有點成績的，却是鳳毛麟角。所以中等職業教育的發展，充其量只能在輕工業方面有點帮助。在目前中國，輕工業有兩種命運：第一，輕工業發展是不可能的。世界經濟恐慌的現階叚，資本國的倾銷政策，吞去了整個的殖民地市塲，連我們最後一滴血都要吸去。没有關税保護的國度裏，有什麽法子避免呢？第二，輕工業是不需要的。一個落後破碎到這種狀况的國家，正需要大量的建設，製造大量的生産工具。在這艱苦的過渡時代，微末的輕工業是没有帮助的，是不需要的。明顯的説，輕工業是一種消費用品的製造。</p>
<p>這樣説來，職業教育在中國並没有製成什麽福利。其最大原因有二，第一，因爲資本經濟的畸形發展，使得商業教育在職業教育中佔個重要的位置。第二，因爲教育制度的抄製，就照樣畫葫蘆似的開辦遠離實際的職業科目。職業教育我們仍是需要的，不過今後的路向，却得要從新開闢。</p>
<p>究竟需要怎樣的職業教育，這個問題範圍很廣。這裏只能提出一個動向來。卽是，我們今後需要的是生産的職業教育。</p>
<p>生産的職業教育，有兩個特質：</p>
<p>（一）在現狀下要排斥消費的職業教育，要使每個人能直接參加生産，要建設一個新型的國家。</p>
<p>（一）發展重工業，利用中國天然的富力，使各種工業和農業機械化，更要求其電氣化。</p>
<p>生産的職業教育，是爲社會的，不是爲個人的，是爲大多數人的需要，不是爲少數人的享受。</p>

<h3>蘇聯第二五年計劃中的蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 培仁</p>
<p>春天來了，一切生物都忙着活動了。蜜蜂可就是其中的一種，牠們是一種很有組織，很集圑化的動物，這是大家都很感興味的一種動物。</p>
<p>養蜂在蘇聯是很普遍的工作。從農村經濟的小而又不關重要的片段，蜜蜂文化在現在已變爲很重要的一個部門，在科學的基點上把牠歸劃到中央的管理下。</p>
<p>在一九二九年｜三○年蘇聯對於蜜蜂的保護已經開始用蜂房架來代替舊的木箱房了。一九一九年只有百分之十七合用的蜂房留在蜂房架上，但到一九二六年百分數是加到五四·九，一九三一加到六一·七。這巨大的進展是隨着農村集圑化來的，現在更大大地增加，蘇聯已經把牠放在大的産産基礎上了，而且有專門管理的機關。</p>
<p>據統計全蘇聯的蜂房數目到一九三一年一月一日爲止共有四，四六六，二○○，其中有二，七五五，一○○是在蜂房架上。到一九三二年一月一日在集圑農塲裏又加多一，五○○，○○○，國營農塲裏加多了五○，○○○。</p>
<p>在蘇聯的各地都在試騐養蜂，特别在北高加索，西伯利亞，遠東，巴什喀利亞，烏克蘭及中央黑土帶等地尤爲重要的區域。</p>
<p>第二五年計劃的重要工作之一就是農産品的收穫增加。作爲植物傳播花粉重要的媒人的蜜蜂，在這一任務上是决定了演看重要的脚色。爲着這目的，農業委員會决定在國營農塲裏加重養蜂的這項工作。因爲不僅對於農業作物可以得到極大的利益，養蜂同時可以得到蜜和蜡，在人類的食用物品中增加了很大的供給。</p>
<p>我們在這春天偶然聽得嗡嗡的蜜蜂的聲音，但我們可曾想到牠和我們人類有什麽大的關係麽？</p>

<h3>成人的學習</h3>
<p>— 陳際雲</p>
<p>｜杜佐　朱君毅譯，商務印書館出版，定價二元六角｜</p>
<p>我們四萬萬同胞中，其已成人而未受過教育者，約佔全數百分之八十，共計有三萬萬二千萬左右。這許多同胞，大部分以爲惟在兒童與青年時期，學習比較容易。以爲成人們的純粹之好奇心已衰退，神經之通道已固定，同化之能力已消滅，學習新觀念，非常困難。這種傳統的思想，實足以惹起許多成人失學者之灰心，而阻撓其無窮的進步。其實，依據桑氏等實騐各種成人學習各種作業的結果，證明這樣的見解完全錯誤。他以爲學習的能量，永不停止，成人之可型性或可教性仍大，二十五歳後仍可繼續學習。本書卽報告自十五歳至四十五歳，尤其自二十五歳至四十五歳，學習能力之分量與性質的變遷，和各種學習的方法的介紹等。</p>
<p>該書共分十三章，第一章是導言，第二章是普通心理學及教育學所報告之成人學習的事實，第三章是述成人學習與兒童學習之比較，第四章是上智成人之學習，第五章是低能成人之學習，第六章是述書記學校成人之學習，第七章是公立夜間中夜成人學習中學學科，第八章是補證之實騐，第九章是純新學習與年齡之差異，第十章是關於成人學習之證據，第十一章是學習能力及所學分量因年齡而變遷之原因，第十二章是年齡與學習之質的差異，第十三章是實際之應用，尚有附錄多頁。</p>
<p>該書文字淺鮮，譯筆流利，很可一讀。希望三萬萬二千萬未受過教育的同胞們，不應自谓年齡太大，妄自畏懼，抑制學習。再不應以此畏懼爲辭，而廢棄你們所應學習者。卽使受過教育的同胞們，也應繼續努力，因爲我們學習的能量，繼續不斷，永不停止的。當今知識進步，一日千里，吾人自十歳至二十歳所學者，至四十歳時，已變爲陳迹，倘做事仍按照舊法，將必動輒得　，危險横生。例如開駛汽車，或開閉普通燈光，彼將不知所爲。又如根本之衛生預防，彼將因忽視而危及性命。故欲文藝與科學等之進步無疆，舍學校内外之繼續教育而末由。希望成人們注意及之。</p>

<h3>羅斯福秉政一年來的成績</h3>
<p>— 堅甫</p>
<p>美國第三十二任總統羅斯福於去年三月四日宣誓就職，計算起來，到現在已經是整整一年了。在這一年中，有人讚揚他，有人責備他，然而他的成績究竟是如何呢？我們不得不站在客觀的立塲上分析一番。在這裏因爲篇幅的關係，我們只從經濟方面來論列。</p>
<p>羅斯福就職的那一天正是美國金融風潮闹得最凶的時候，在那一天美國四十八洲的銀行都陷於非常恐慌的境地。如果是一個能力薄弱的總統的話，那對於這樣嚴重的打擊必定是弄得手忙脚亂而不知所措，然而羅斯福却能毅然地把這事按步就班地解决了下去。他於就職的翌日卽宣佈全國銀行悉行停市十日；再過一天，他又下令禁止金銀出口；七日由財部頒布新銀行條例：於是這空前的暴風雨算是平息了。</p>
<p>金融風潮旣經解决，於是羅斯福就進一步來謀救濟農村，救濟失業。同時站在國際恊調的立塲上和列國代表商討國際經濟問題，作倫敦世界經濟會議的凖備。正在列國代表紛紛赴美的時候，羅斯福宣佈放棄金本位，並向參衆兩院提出膨脹通貨法案。這一來雖則没有破壞華府談話會，然而從此就埋下了世界經濟會議破産的種子。</p>
<p>果然，六月間舉行的世界經濟會議終於因爲安定匯價問題無結果而散。會議散後，國際間的經濟問題不但没有好轉，而且又招致了各國的（經濟自足主義］。這經濟自足主義，在美國便由産業復興法案｜卽藍鷹運動｜充分地表示出來。産業復興法案所打的旗幟雖　　尚有重要文字轉入第五版</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>

<p>則是［和增加工資及使工人獲到工作的方法，以穏定工業並應付兩年來的急變］相號召，然而時至今日，事實已證明了這只是一塲美夢。剛剛實施族業復興法的六月和七月，工業的生産指數固然是一時提高了，然而一入八月，可悲的情形又重新襲來。此後幾乎是一月不如一月地衰落下去。原來在産業復興法案裏雖然規定着增加工資，减少工時，而實際上（一）實質工資趕不上名義工資，（二）减少工作時間只不過是减少在業工人的時間而分配給一部份失業的工人，犠牲甲者來供給乙者，所以這法案雖是多麽動聽，然而對於勞動者的購買力和消費力却毫無增進。</p>
<p>羅斯福目擊到這種悲慘的景象之重新襲來，於是在事情還没有完全失敗之前，就迅雷不及掩耳地於十月二十五日來了一個收買黃金政策。爲什麽要收買黃金呢？這有雙重的意義。一方面是因爲國内反對通貨膨脹政策的聲浪日趨高漲，政府不得不由收買黃金來作安定幣價的表示（所謂貶低幣價至五角九分零六毫，卽此表示之一）；一方面可由美金對外匯價之跌落而剌激出口之增加。　　黃金已是大量地收買了，接着又緊緊地來了一個提高銀價收買白銀的辦法。前者是以進攻金本位國家來輔助自國貿易的辦法；而後者又恰是以犠牲銀本位國家（中國）來增進産業復興的政策。</p>
<p>綜觀羅斯福秉政一年來所採的經濟政策，我們可以斷然地説：他是完全站在膨脹通貨的觀點上來處理美國經濟恐慌的災難。膨脹通貨的效用是一時的，所以羅斯福的救濟恐慌也是一時的。羅斯福是一個頗有能力的政治領袖，然而縱使他的能力再高一倍，面對着這矛盾重重的經濟總恐慌，恐怕也終於是徒呼負負吧！</p>
<h3>兒童節慶祝聲中大女孩領獎記</h3>
<p>— 沈愛蓉女士</p>
<p>因爲我是婦女國貨年徵文領獎的，所以没有入塲劵，像我這樣一個大女孩也得參與兒童節的盛會。［領獎在三樓］，他們知道我的來歷後這樣的對我説。</p>
<p>籃球鞋的橡皮底吻遍了三層樓梯，三位松江女中的領獎同志已先我而至，不知所從的在三樓徘徊着。後經一位招待員的指導，方知徵文領獎在二樓會塲舉行。</p>
<p>跑到二樓，一陣喧嘩嘈雜的人聲，從黑壓壓的擠滿在台前的人頭中發出來，把站在台上演説的那位女士尖鋭的聲音壓下去又揚起來。</p>
<p>是兒童節呵！台前滿是拿着贈品笑嘻嘻的天眞的臉，大約對於演説感不到興趣吧？只不住的騷動着，把會塲的秩序擾亂了。</p>
<p>一陣掌聲送下了女士，迎上了男士，他的嘴金魚呼吸般的張着，聽不出一個字，聲浪給人聲壓下去了。又是一陣掌聲引出了一位操着清脆的北平话的小姐携着一個小朋友介紹給聽衆：［這是蔡孑民先生的公子蔡ＸＸ先生，是很聰明的，今天請他演说。］兩旁的電燈照在他小臉上，使他顯得更可愛了，可是，只見他張了張嘴就鞠躬退去，大約有些怯人吧？還有兩位穿紅衣林擒臉的小孩子是潘仰堯先生的女公子，榮任國貨公司兒童市的市長，是兒童市的要人呵！忙煞了攝影師。</p>
<p>北平小姐宣讀了提案：一，救濟流浪兒童；二，設立託兒所；三，····。掌聲結束了這報告。</p>
<p>徵文領獎開始了，聶曾紀芬先生和潘仰堯先生給獎，大學部中學部共有六十二人。因爲時間不够，只將前五名的當時給獎，餘下的被邀至後台。第六，是的，我記得我是在第六，就　到後台，領到一份請帖似的紅封袋，中間端正的寫着五個字，［沈愛蓉女士］</p>
<p>游藝開始了，第一個節目的淞滬廣慈醫院的童子軍的遊唱，多英武的小朋友，多敏捷齊整的動作，誰説中國是病夫國？但，能全國小朋友都有這健强的體格，奮發的精神多好，不然，局部的發展是没有多大效力的。</p>
<p>時間已四點鐘了，以下雖還有許多精彩的節目，但我因有點小事，只得别了這許多可愛的小朋友，和這兒童的　　地，　出了湖社的大門。</p>

<h3>投蛋入瓶</h3>
<p>— 穎秋</p>
<p>這個玩意兒是可以作物理中［熱　冷缩］的試騐，讀者諸君業餘有暇，不妨玩玩。</p>
<p>買一個鷄蛋或鴨蛋，浸在滿鍋的熱水中，使蛋白稍爲變硬，然後去其殼。另一面拿一小頸的瓶，瓶口須較蛋略小，乃取幾張紙片，用火燃着，投入瓶内。瓶中空氣，因受熱而澎漲，一部份便逃出瓶口。在火正燒着時，將去殼之蛋置在瓶口。瓶中空氣稀薄，外界的空氣的壓力壓住瓶口，火熄時，瓶中空氣變冷而體積縮小，外界的空氣不得不進瓶中，但因有蛋塞住，瓶外空氣壓在蛋上，瓶内空氣力量薄弱，蛋不得不砰然一聲落入瓶中了。</p>
<p>在玩之前，我們最好尋一個頸小而底很大的瓶，因爲瓶的容量大了，瓶中空氣的容積也可以大些，而做起來也就比較容易得多了。</p>

<h3>路路不通</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>我是個小資産階級陣列裏的人，話雖是這麽説，但生活却迫切的脅臨着我。從我的家庭環境講，我不能不解决我的生活問題，可是生活問題却是這麽難得解决的，這教我怎麽好呢？</p>
<p>是怎樣我都想找一門穏靠而正當的職業。但找職業却是這樣艱難而陌生的，我現在是好像走在一個深深的林莽中一樣，我怎樣才能找尋我的出路呢？</p>
<p>有些人是總贊同我當教員。當教員這事我也是幹過的。我覺得没有别的更好的路這也是條好路。因爲教員的生活是常常與書本子接近的。能够常常這樣在知識中淘洗着，一定也可以從這種淘洗中獲得許多磨練的機會和教益。但我怎樣能找到一個如意的教員位置呢？隨處的教育界都是滿網着派别，是他們這派就可以混得進，不是他們這派的却是設法也會將你排出來。並且一般的校長們，是最不相信我們青年的。他們都以爲老的就是好的，學問旣淵博，經騐也豐富，而年紀輕的就都是些没用的廢材，卽使有點學識，也不過是皮毛而已。並且根本就危險，说不定在第一課開堂裏就會行着什麽［色］的宣傳。於是一見了我們青年就感到頭痛似地，這樣又怎樣會得到他們的信任呢？</p>
<p>教員難得當，有人於是勸我進政界活動。政界活動雖是我不願的，但是爲了生活問題也説不得。於是我也這樣想過。但是政界更屬是閥閲和私淑的。第一點，就是派别來得嚴，大派之下還有小派之分。小派裏又分成那個是最親信的，那個是次親信的。你若是在先没有和他們有着親密的關係，那你這時就卽管賣身投靠，你也加入不了那機關。第二點，就是最小的一個小吏兒，引薦也要有個大人物，没有大人物替你去説話，就是一個小門房也是找不上的。</p>
<p>於是有人要我去投軍界，他們説這於我也相當的適宜。因爲這裏面只要吃得苦頭，捨得生死，就有出頭。出頭固是所需的，但是這生命却是捨給那個呢？我很猶疑。而生活的脅臨却又是這樣可怕。但是這也是種無用的企圖呵！軍界和政界是一樣的，門閥是非常之森嚴。没有和他們有密切的長久的關聯，就怎樣也不能插足進去。</p>
<p>於是以一般人的説法，却是智識份子可走的路都是不通了。因爲我没有商業的知識，自然也混不進商業的機關。生而没有文學的天才，自也不能向書肆和雜誌報紙上去討飯吃。而我的生活問題却總是要解决的呀！可是我却怎樣解决法呢？</p>
<h3>失了平靜的心</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>我最近漸漸的發生了一種　　的感覺，我學得人生是這麽隔膜而冷酷的，因是我對人生厭倦了起來。起　我遭受着這種　　的時候，我仍還能够維持我日常生活的程序，現在，這襲擊起來越深重了，使我逐漸地抛棄這日常生活的規條，我對甚麽事都覺得是灰暗，我對甚麽事都覺得厭倦起來了。</p>
<p>在從前我覺得哲學是最爲可親的，我很願朝夕徘徊於那哲學的迷宫，任着那些深遠的名言，將我深深的陶醉。我記得我有個時候，我拚命地讀尼采，我覺得他是個了不得的英雄，他的那超人論的雄詞便好像喝醒世人的號鐘。後來我讀黑格爾，一樣覺得他是個超絶今古的偉人，我留連於他的國家論之間，我覺得德意志的靈魂已爲他一手把握了。接着我便覺得厭倦了，我無理的拼絶了牠們。我便再没有讀牠們。這是爲什麽呢？我不能明白的説，我只覺得我的心已不能再那樣安定，再安定的隨着這班偉哲的筆端，而引入他們那深奥的玄理中。我不但是這樣，我簡直一見了牠我就煩悶了。</p>
<p>接着這以後，我便瘋狂似了的看小説。我看小説看得異常之多，我常是爲想終結一個故事，甚至飯也忘掉吃，覺也忘掉睡。我非常的同情於那女主人翁。我覺得一個戀愛勝利的女郎，就好像我也參預着那勝利似的。有時候，一個故事收束得很悲慘，則我也好像是心上受了一個創戮，不勝心酸。從古典的，浪漫派的，一直讀到現在的各種新著。一時候，我腦子裏充滿了各種故事的憧憬：並許多次我好像生活在那小説中去了，我忘記了這現實的一切情形。那時候，我私心不自主的快慰着。因爲我雖失掉了哲學的興趣，但我現在却仍獲得一個新的歸宿了。可是一到了現在呵！：：：我什麽小説都不想看了。我再不覺得那甜美的故事能對我誘惑：我再不覺得那境地值得我留連。我的心意灰黯異常，我覺得甚麽努力都是無味了。</p>
<p>這其間，我也曾問過自己，我是否失掉了我的健康，我的身軀的孱弱是否影響着我的心境？可是我的身體是依樣健碩的，它不會影響心境，只有心境來影響着它。於是我煩悶起來了。我找不出這煩悶的原由，我只是煩悶。我並覺得什麽都是空虚，什麽都是冷漠，世人不會了解我，我也懶得去了解别人。生活祇在一種垂死的狀態中拖延着，我頽喪極了。</p>
<p>我將向那裏走呢？我是否還可以找回我那平靜的心境？唉，我是多麽的惶惑！我是多麽的痛若！</p>

<h3>名人傳記</h3>
<h3>無綫電發明者馬可尼（一）</h3>
<p>— 森然</p>
<p>在近代的一切偉大發明中，無綫電是佔着一個很重要的位置的。如果火車。輪船。飛機的出現縮短了空間的距離，那麽，因爲無綫電的發明，空間的距離更是完全地被打破了。只要有了無綫電，我們坐在上海也可以聽到倫敦政治家的演説，紐約少女們的歌聲；只要有了無綫電，將軍們便可以安坐在家中指揮幾百萬的海陸空軍，投機家也可以坐在上海知道紐約交易所的情形，如果你高興，要留在上海呌柏林的照相館給你照張美術相，也可以借無綫電來達到你的目的。｜｜無綫電的發明，是把大陸，海洋，太空，總之，整個的空間打成了一片｜由此，無論商業，軍事，政治乃至人類的全部生活，都得到了莫大的便利。</p>
<p>但是，無綫電的發明者究竟是誰呢？這便是我們要説的馬可尼（ＧnglielmoMarcon）</p>
<p>馬可尼於一八七四年四月二十五日生於意大利的波倫尼亞城附近的格里芬村。他的父親是意大利的地主，母親也是出自愛爾蘭的一個名門。所以，他從小就過着很舒適的生活，什麽窮困，苦痛，是與他没有多大關係的。</p>
<p>因爲家庭環境很好，馬可尼的教育當然是憑他的志願解决的。他在十五歳時就進了波倫尼亞大學，常常受當時意大利著名的物理學家里契（AngnstoRigbi）的指導。</p>
<p>馬可尼當然是一個天資聰明的人，他自小就很勤學，對於自然科學更是特别愛好，在他還是一個十二歳的少年時，黑爾支（ＨeinraebＨertz）博士已經開始了他的有名的實騐，這對於聰明的，特别愛好自然科學的馬可尼，不消説是有很大影響的。他讀了黑爾支的實騐報告之後，馬上便發生了一個感想：没有電綫也是可以通電信的！</p>
<p>黑爾支的實騐旣增加了馬可尼研究電氣的興趣：同時，里契教授也在努力［黑爾支電波］的研究，這對於馬可尼不消説是有更大的關係。因爲他的聰明，努力，喜歡研究電氣，里契教授也非常喜歡他，他不僅從這位有名的物理學教授那裏得到了許多寳貴的教訓，而且還得到了許多實際的便宜。里契教授在指導馬可尼的研究中，把他所有的無綫電器械，如電弧發生器等等都借給他用，鼓勵他去努力於無綫電的發明。於是，馬可尼才下了研究無綫電的决心。這時他還是一個二十二歳的青年。</p>
<p>最初，他是在家鄉的院子裏開始實騐。他先在一隅豎立起一根竹竿，又再别一隅豎起另外的竹竿，然後將今日所謂之Ｒadiator（無綫電之傳受綫）連結於這兩隅竪立的竿上，再在Ｒadiltor的上端吊着一個Ｂlik罐，以努力他的工作。這種辦法，在鄉人們看來，當然是很奇妙可笑的。但是，馬可尼一點也不注意人們對他的嘲笑態度，只是努力去做他的［奇妙的］事情。這樣，一天一天地下去，馬可尼竟獲得了第一次的成功，如果他把Ｂlik罐吊在離地約六呎高時，便可傳達一○○碼距離的信號；如果把Ｂlik罐陞高至一四呎時，卽可傳達約三○○碼距離的信號。結果他實騐得了：若增加blik罐的大量（電氣容量）與其垂懸的高度，則便可以實行一·五哩的通信。</p>
<p>馬尼可曾在里契的實騐室中問過這樣的問題：怎樣增大電波的感受的距離？里契對這問題的回答是：［陞高你的振動器看］。這對於馬可尼的研究有很大的啓示，他的最初的成功，就是在這個啓示之下，在努力於Ｒadiator的高度與通信距離之關係的研究中，而獲得的。</p>
<p>馬可尼爲要把他研究的結果廣泛地發表出來，便寫信告知了當時英國郵政廳的技師長普里士（ＳirWHpreece）</p>
<p>當時普里士也在研究他的無綫電信，而且是有相當的成績的。但他看了馬可尼的研究之後，便覺得這位意大利青年比自己還要高明。他馬上寫了一封很詳細的回信去和馬可尼討論關於無綫電的問題，同時在這信的後面寫着這樣的話｜｜｜［·····假如對於你没有妨礙的話，那就請你無論如何也來英國一趟。關於你的發明，將儘可能地謀諸便宜。］（未完）</p>

<p>Takeover Negotiations for Malanyu Stalled</p>
<p>Twenty-Nine Newly Arrived Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Stationed in Tianjin Notify of Upcoming Exercises and Marches in the War Zone</p>
<p>Actively Preparing for Military Action Against Russia</p>
<p>(Beiping) The suspension of the Malanyu takeover issue due to Japanese demands for postponement has fueled widespread suspicion. However, our side is determined to continue negotiations. We have already telegraphed Huang Fu about the suspension. It is generally speculated that progress on the Malanyu takeover issue will be delayed until Huang returns to Beiping. Recently, the Japanese have sent over a hundred retired military officers to Beiping. They are residing in the Japanese embassy and have been assigned to various provinces including Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shandong, and Jiangsu, under the guise of travel, to scout out local conditions. In recent days, Japanese troops in the war zone and at various passes of the Great Wall have been traveling frequently and appear quite active. Yesterday, twenty-nine Japanese aircraft arrived in Malanyu. At the same time, the Japanese garrison in Tianjin notified our side of their intention to conduct marching exercises in the war zone in the near future. However, the date, number of troops, and route have not been specified, and our side has not yet responded. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huo Shiding will return to Beiping in the next day or two to report on the local reorganization after the takeover of Gubeikou, and to discuss the withdrawal of the puppet police with Chaisan. Chaisan is scheduled to go to Shanxi at 9 a.m. on the 8th. The Japanese claim his mission is travel, but it is known that his purpose is to investigate transportation conditions under the instructions of the Japanese Army Ministry, with a particular focus on the development of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, with a planned one-week stay in Datong before returning to Beiping. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japan is actively preparing for military action against Russia, with plans to use the Xing'an Mountains, Heilongjiang, and the Great Wall as three lines of defense against Russia. Therefore, they are unwilling to give up the natural barrier of the Great Wall. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Miyun states that the puppet state has dispatched a large number of personnel to various areas of Miyun County, including the areas outside Qiangzilu Pass, Daxiaohuangyan, and the five districts of Miyun, to conduct door-to-door household registration checks, survey land, increase land taxes, and force the people to pay grain taxes to the Xinglong County government. The people are suffering greatly and crying out in distress. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Machijiri, Chaisan, and others inspected the Japanese troops in Gubeikou and returned to Beiping at 5 p.m. on the 7th. Machijiri is scheduled to go to Tianjin on the morning of the 8th and stay briefly to inspect the Tianjin East area. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Returns to the Capital</h3>
<p>Shi Ying Agrees to Return to the Capital to Resume His Post</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren, on the orders of President Wang, went to Hubei to persuade Shi Ying to return to the capital to resume his post. He also visited Chiang in Nanchang during his stopover in Xunyang to report on the diplomatic situation. On the 6th, he completed his mission and set off from Hankou with Huang Fu on the German-flagged Dehe steamer. Huang disembarked in Jiujiang because he had to go to Jiangxi to see Chiang. Tang then took the same steamer directly to the capital, arriving at Xiaguan at noon on the 7th. After disembarking, he returned to his residence to rest. At noon, he visited Wang to report on his meetings with Chiang and Shi. Huang also asked Tang to briefly describe the situation in North China. Shi also entrusted Tang with a personal letter to Wang, expressing his sincere gratitude for the Central Government's repeated invitations and vowing to repay the kindness. Tang went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the afternoon and told visiting reporters that Shi had agreed to return to the capital to resume his post and would arrive in the capital soon. The campaign to suppress bandits in Jiangxi Province is progressing smoothly, and most of the bandit areas have been recovered. After being reorganized, they have gradually returned to their former state. Currently, there are only seven counties that are truly bandit areas, and they are under tight encirclement by the Central Army. When reporters inquired about other issues, he replied that there was nothing more to say. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Huang Fu</h3>

However, Wang has already accepted an invitation from the Lixing Society to speak on the significance of the New Life Movement in the afternoon of the 8th. If he cannot depart on the 8th, he is expected to leave the capital on the 9th. (7th - Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiters Over Guyuan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou states that a Japanese aircraft flew over Guyuan at 10 a.m. on the 6th to conduct reconnaissance, then flew low for about half an hour before returning to Dolon. Zhang Yunrong telegraphed that the puppet troops of Li Shouxin in the 2nd and 4th districts of Guyuan still show no signs of withdrawing. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumor of Fu Zuoyi Returning to Baotou</h3>
<p>Sun's Generals to Visit He in Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Linhe states that Fu Zuoyi left Linhe on the 7th and returned to Baotou to meet with Huang Shaoxiong in Suiyuan. The Suiyuan Provincial Government has rented rooms in the Suiyuan Hotel as Huang's residence. The reorganization of Sun's army is being handled by Wang Jingguo and others at the front and is now complete. Several thousand soldiers have been demobilized and will be sent from Linhe to Baotou for discharge within the next few days. Liu Yueting, Yu Shiming, and Lu Fengnian have all arrived in Linhe and will come to Beiping within the next few days to visit He and request instructions. The Yu and Lu brigades are expected to be transferred to Hebei Province for training in mid-April. Xiao Renyuan, a major general staff officer dispatched by the Military Branch, went to Baotou at noon on the 7th to handle military liaison. It is undecided whether Men Bingyue will go again. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is decided that the remnants of Sun's army will gather in Baotou on the 10th and begin verification on the 15th. Li Ming and Zhang Xuanze are scheduled to return to Baotou from Sanshenggong before the 15th to handle the downsizing according to the Branch's orders. (7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a road report, after more than a thousand remnants of Sun's army arrived in Baotou, they set up tents outside the station. There have been robbery cases in Baotou recently, and the city gates close around 7 p.m. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin plans to summon Sun's generals Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, Ding Futing, and Lu Fengnian to give them instructions after the reorganization of Sun's army is completed. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fu Zuoyi telegraphed the Executive Yuan, stating that Sun Dianying's troops had moved to the Baotou area of western Suiyuan in November of last year and had not yet returned the cattle and horses borrowed from the people. With the spring plowing season approaching, the people are destitute. He earnestly requests that funds be allocated for disaster relief to purchase cattle and horses to facilitate spring plowing. (7th - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Zeding, section chief of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, telegraphed Ma Bingren, director of the 35th Army's office in Beiping, on the 7th, stating that Fu Zuoyi left Linhe for Baotou on the 7th and is scheduled to arrive on the same day.

<p>Yu Xuezhong Will Inspect Eastern Hebei</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The attitude of the Kailuan-Tangshan mine workers has softened due to the Provincial Government ordering Zhao Xun and Tao Shangming to suspend mediation and focus on strictly arresting the leaders.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Pessimistic Outlook for the Future of Disarmament</h3>
<p>It has been more than ten years since the League of Nations established the Permanent Disarmament Commission in 1920. It has been two years since the official convening of the Disarmament Conference in 1932. During this period, there have been numerous plenary sessions, general committee meetings, subcommittee meetings, and steering committee meetings. The frequency of these meetings is difficult to count. The number of proposals, the intensity of disputes, and the complexity of the agenda are also dizzying and confusing. However, examining the evolution of the past two years and asking what results or achievements have been achieved, one cannot help but feel disappointed.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing is that the results of the previous meetings not only did not lead to any reduction in armaments, but also showed a tendency to re-expand them. We believe that if the great powers participating in the disarmament conference have the sincerity to reduce their armies, they should take Chapter 5 of the Treaty of Versailles, which restricts German armaments, as the basis for discussion. This is because the Allied Powers made a statement in the clauses of this chapter that they would jointly disarm after Germany. When the Allied Powers made this statement, they thought that the only obstacle to peace was Germany. If Germany disarms to the limits allowed by the treaty, there would be no problem with the joint disarmament of all countries. Furthermore, a careful examination of the tone of this statement reveals that it contains the meaning that the disarmament of all countries should take Germany as the standard, and that the real reduction of the armaments of all countries cannot be achieved without this standard.</p>
<p>However, since the opening of the first Disarmament Conference, very few countries have used Chapter 5 of the treaty as the basis for discussion. The great powers all pushed each other around and had other plans. For example, Britain's intention was to focus on reducing land armaments in order to weaken France's hegemonic power in Europe. France knew this, so in addition to using the word "security" as an excuse, it also proposed the organization of an international navy, hinting at its intention to manipulate the British navy as a countermeasure. As for Italy's resonance with Germany, it was purely out of its usual jealousy towards France. Its intention was to divide France's power to strengthen its own position. There was really no country with the sincerity to genuinely disarm. Therefore, Germany was indignant and dissatisfied, and withdrew from the conference on September 14 of this year (1932). The transformation of the Disarmament Conference into an Armament Expansion Conference began at this point. Since the countries were unwilling to reduce their armaments to Germany's level, there was no other way but to allow Germany to slightly reorganize its armaments. After several months of mediation by Britain, the Five-Power Declaration was produced, which transformed the disarmament situation. It allowed Germany to enjoy equal rights under the condition of not endangering the security of other countries. After this declaration, Germany's actions to reorganize its armaments became legal. Extending to March 16 of last year, the British draft made Germany's position to reorganize its armaments stronger. According to this draft, Germany could expand its standing army to 200,000 men within eight years, while France, Italy, Poland and other countries would have to reduce their troops to 200,000 men within eight years. At that time, Britain thought that since it could not make France disarm, it would be better to rearm Germany. Little did they know that the trend of expanding armaments would grow secretly from then on. The facts that have been revealed to people in the past year are like this. Judging from the recent back-and-forth consultations between Britain, France, and Germany in recent months, the trend of expanding armaments has increased unabated. Britain, which previously did not allow Germany to equip small tanks and heavy artillery, also advocated giving them. Germany's demand for a standing army cannot be less than 300,000 men. As for France, it cannot be without suspicion. It seems to contain the intention to overturn the Five-Power Declaration of the previous year. In this complex and contradictory situation, reopening the Disarmament Steering Committee, who would believe that it can have good results?</p>
<p>Looking at the Disarmament Conference in the past two years, we can see that this conference not only has no achievements, but also helps countries expand their armies. The countries that implemented disarmament in the past will now reorganize their armaments. How can the countries with strong armaments today disarm alone and be willing to lag behind? Therefore, Britain's current plan only makes countries compete in armaments and cannot benefit peace in any way. Britain's traditional foreign policy has never wanted a strong power in Europe that is difficult to control. Therefore, before the Russo-Japanese War, Britain once allied with France to contain Russia. After the Russo-Japanese War, it allied with France to contain Germany. Today, France is strong and Germany is weak, so it is better to ally with Germany and Italy. Therefore, its advocacy has always focused on the reduction of land armaments. If France is unwilling to reduce, it may as well allow Germany to increase its armaments slightly, but it is not willing to express it easily. If this is the case, it is difficult to dispel the suspicion of the European countries, and there is really no way to resolve the future of disarmament.</p>

<h3>France Clearly States Position, Armament Reduction Reveals a Glimmer of Hope</h3>
<p>France First Wants to Understand the Limits of German Armaments</p>
<p>Final Judgment Still Rests with Geneva</p>
<p>Britain Proposes Convening a Conference</p>
<p>To Discuss Treaty Guarantee Issues</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, on the chessboard of European disarmament, France has made another move, namely, the new response to the questions raised by Britain. The statement clarifying France's position has been telegraphed to the French Ambassador to Britain today. The reasons stated by France still seem to protect the interests of the smaller countries in the guarantee agreement, and there is not much progress on the topic of disarmament itself. However, government sources here say that since France has accepted Britain's request to reopen negotiations, there has indeed been progress in the disarmament process. (Sixth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although there are still many apparent difficulties in the Anglo-French negotiations on disarmament and security guarantees, the note proposed by Britain to continue the disarmament and security guarantee conference was delivered to the French government today by the British Ambassador to France, Sir Tyrrell, and has been accepted by the French government. The French Foreign Ministry is also rushing to draft a reply to the British note. France will accept Britain's request in its note and clarify France's position, especially emphasizing the guarantee responsibilities that Britain will bear in the future when [disarmament clauses] are harmed. It is said that France's note can be completed by the end of this week and handed over to Sir Tyrrell. It is widely rumored that the French government will clearly explain in the joint note what kind of guarantees will be welcomed by France. The above news is very important because it can give the dying disarmament conference a glimmer of hope. Previously, the British government had also exhausted all methods to explore France's specific opinions on Britain's initial disarmament memorandum, but in the end, nothing was gained. France's attitude towards a section of Britain's initial disarmament memorandum, namely, the guarantee issue raised when France is attacked by an enemy, is particularly ambiguous. In its note delivered to the British government by Ambassador Corbin, France explained that what France wants to accept is territorial guarantees rather than ordinary guarantees. However, to what extent the future guarantee issue can progress is not something we can know. (Seventh National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon spent the whole day today studying France's memorandum on disarmament. According to Reuters, the French memorandum proves that Britain's memorandum has made progress. The French memorandum recognizes some changes in the current situation. France previously refused to acknowledge the extent of Germany's existing rearmament, but now it expresses its willingness to discuss Germany's rearmament plans. However, France still insists that the final judgment must rest with the Disarmament Conference. The French memorandum does give people greater hope that a disarmament treaty can be established. At the same time, after a long conversation, French Foreign Minister Barthou told Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson that the French delegation could support the proposal to convene a general disarmament conference on April 23. Henderson then set off for Geneva to chair the meeting of the Disarmament Conference's core staff on Tuesday. (Seventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is expected that within a week, the French government will reply to the British government with a memorandum on armaments. It is heard that the document will propose that all paramilitary organizations should be made harmless. The implementation of the treaty must be strictly monitored. Any violation of the treaty must be subject to preliminary economic sanctions. It is expected that Britain and France will make friendly efforts on the latter two conditions, because France does not want the arms treaty to leave any loopholes, while Britain opposes strict restrictions. (Sixth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) On March 28 of this year, the British government submitted an official document to the French government, raising several questions regarding the guarantees for the implementation of the disarmament treaty mentioned in France's reply on March 17, requesting the French government to explain them. Later, the British government instructed the British Ambassador to France, Sir Tyrrell, to inquire about the French government's opinions on three points: (1) the reduction of France's own armaments, (2) the benefits granted to Germany in the British plan, and (3) guarantees for the implementation of the disarmament treaty. This morning, during the State Council meeting, Foreign Minister Barthou submitted a draft oral note answering the British questions for discussion, which was approved by the State Council. All the questions raised by the British government must be studied in the long term through diplomatic procedures. The oral note is only a brief reply. The content of the note briefly stated that the security issue has always been the focus of French policy. It is gratifying that the British authorities can understand this. However, before accepting the disarmament treaty proposed by the British government, France wants to know how its technical clauses are stipulated. The British side has made some proposals regarding France's own armaments. The French government believes that it must wait until Britain recognizes the military quotas and weapons that must be given to Germany, which are clarified by France, before France can express its own armaments. The oral note also stated that if Germany's rearmament is officially recognized, other countries restricted by the treaty will also request it as an example. As for what methods can be used to protect the future disarmament treaty from being violated, the Foreign Minister will notify the British Foreign Secretary later. As it stands, France cannot recognize Britain's advocacy of allowing Germany to partially rearm while France begins to disarm. (Sixth Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>French Foreign Minister Will Tour the East to Consolidate the Triangular Power</h3>
<p>The French Foreign Minister will visit Warsaw on April 22. People in Southern Yugoslavia are paying close attention to this move. Political figures say that after the establishment of the Four-Power Pact between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the diplomatic relations between France and Poland have been slightly cold. Barthou's talks in Warsaw this time can renew old friendships, and the alliance between the two sides will turn from cold to intimate. Some people say that the relationship between Yugoslavia and France has been intimate, and from a political point of view, there is no need for Barthou's visit, but if the French Foreign Minister can come, it will be of great benefit to the relations between the two countries. [The Slovenian Newspaper of Ljubljana] said that for the past fifteen years, Europe has been spared from disturbance entirely thanks to the tripartite standing power of France, Poland, and the Little Entente.

<h3>Black Tom Explosion Case in the European War Era</h3>
<p>US Will Reopen Old Case</p>
<p>Demanding Compensation from Germany</p>
<p>(Washington) It is now known that the United States intends to ask the Allied Reparations Bureau to re-handle the famous Black Tom explosion case, demanding that Germany compensate 40 million gold yuan. This request is based on the oath of Irish labor activist James Larkin, because Larkin knows a person who is now a senior official in Hitler's administration. This person was the German manager of this case during the European War. Only he knew about the Black Tom explosion case, which caused a loss of 40 million gold yuan and many lives. (Sixth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) In the summer of 1916, 300 trains loaded with ammunition exploded on the Brackton River in Jersey City, killing and injuring hundreds of people. This ammunition was to supply the Allied countries. This matter was done by German spies, intending to cut off the source of ammunition for the Allied countries. It had a great impact on the United States' decision to participate in the war. At that time, the United States demanded 40 million yuan in damages from Germany, but the dispute continued without result. An investigation was conducted at the time of the incident, and an Irishman named Roelken was arrested and imprisoned. After serving his sentence and being released, he was deported in 1922. The train explosion case that had been going on for many years was shelved. Unexpectedly, news has recently been received from Ireland that Roelken, who was deported in 1922, recently detailed to the US Consulate General in Berlin various destructive acts committed by Germans in the United States before the United States entered the war, especially mentioning the ammunition explosion on the Brackton River, and said that a German was involved in the matter, who is now a member of the German government and a close friend of Hitler. He also made the same declaration to a former member of the British military intelligence bureau last December. Washington believes that the US's demand for compensation from Germany for this case has been suspended since 1932. Now that Roelken's declaration has been obtained, this case can be continued.

<h3>French Civil Servants Resist Government Orders, Government Advises Prudence</h3>
<p>Saying that Reducing Politics Will Save the Country from Difficulties</p>
<p>Union Representatives Petition the President</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Cabinet's implementation of the salary reduction policy has aroused resistance from civil servants. The public is angry. The Dumergue Cabinet has no choice but to issue another circular today, warning all civil servants to be prudent. The circular states that this salary reduction is to save the government's financial difficulties. If not, the country will go bankrupt. All members should understand the government's difficulties. After this order was issued, various personnel still voiced their dissatisfaction from time to time. Tomorrow (7th) there may be more serious gatherings to confront the cabinet.

The Prime Minister told them that the government considers the issue of saving political expenses with a larger perspective, which is a last resort. The interests of civil servants are certainly legitimate, but the country's economic situation is currently extremely critical, and it should also be taken into account. The conversation between the two sides lasted one hour and a half, and the process was quite pleasant. (Sixth Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Minneapolis This morning, police and 3,000 unemployed people clashed outside the city hall, using bottles, bricks, clubs, and tear gas as weapons. Later, the police announced that if they did not withdraw, they would immediately deploy the National Guard to suppress them. The crowd then dispersed and order was restored. Four policemen were injured and 20 unemployed people were arrested. The city hall was destroyed by bricks and stones, causing no small loss. The unemployed people initially gathered to march, shouting "We want bread and work!" and demanding the restoration of the dissolved Civil Engineering Bureau, because the abolition of this agency hindered the work of hundreds of people. When they reached the city hall, the crowd began to throw bricks and glass bottles, smashing the windows of the mayor's office. The police then drove them away with clubs, and a melee broke out between the two sides. Firefighters were ordered to come to the rescue and threw tear gas, and the crowd retreated slightly. The situation was very serious at the time. Machine guns were placed in front of the city hall, but they were not fired. The police, fearing that the incident would escalate, threatened to deploy troops to help, and the crowd gradually dispersed upon hearing this, but they had been fighting for more than two hours. Several firefighters wanted to use hoses to shoot water to resist the rioters, but they were beaten. Street traffic was temporarily blocked. (Sixth Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>France Prepares to Reconcile the Stalemate on War Debts with the US</h3>
<p>The Cabinet is Studying Payment Methods</p>
<p>A Big Bomb from Washington Takes Effect Immediately</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources today, France may resume paying its war debts to the United States. Several French political leaders said when meeting with a US Associated Press reporter today that the French installment payment of war debts to the US will be due on June 15 of this year. If Prime Minister Dumergue is still in office at that time, the stalemate on war debts may be partially resolved. According to reliable sources from official circles, the members of the French mixed cabinet are currently considering payment methods. There are two proposals for these people: one is to follow the precedent of Britain's credit payment due in June of this year, and the other is to only pay the interest on the war debts due. What the French government urgently wants to know now is whether President Roosevelt is willing to accept France's partial solution to war debts as a guide to clarifying the entire war debt dispute. The French installment payment of war debts to the US due on June 15 of this year totals US$55,845,953, of which US$19,154,047 is interest. The total amount of French war debts to the US is approximately US$4,000,000,000. It is believed that former French Prime Minister Herriot (the French cabinet in the autumn of 1932) in the Dumergue cabinet was the originator of the reconciliation of war debt disputes. Other members of the cabinet are also deeply afraid of the US's anti-France in this turbulent time in Europe, and are thinking of ways to appease the Americans. The French cabinet has not yet discussed the war debt issue, but it is reported that several members of the cabinet have already conducted private research on the possibility of reconciling the war debt stalemate. The French House of Representatives still maintains its previous firm opposition to paying war debts. When the Herriot cabinet insisted on paying the installment payment of war debts due on December 15 of that year in 1932, it resigned due to the opposition of the French House of Representatives. Since the fall of the Herriot cabinet, France has not paid a penny for war debts. What is noteworthy today is that the French cabinet may not consult with the parliament before deciding its attitude towards war debts. Moreover, the French parliament has also granted the Dumergue cabinet the privilege of presiding over financial plans. It is believed that if Mr. Dumergue can be confident that his cabinet is not controlled by the parliament, he can also use this power to plan the source of war debts due in June. Furthermore, there is a very strong group in the French Senate, composed of senators from the French wine-producing regions, whose leader is Rustin. This group agrees that France should take goodwill actions on war debts owed to the US. Teitieu in the Dumergue cabinet is one of the most vehement opponents of paying war debts. Teitieu may express his opinions on the war debt issue in a few days, but a few people expect that Teitieu may change his attitude after listening to the advice of others.

<h3>Britain's War Debts to the US Not Included in the Budget</h3>
<p>(London) It is expected that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will be able to present a publicly welcomed budget on April 17. Well-informed sources in London have learned that the Chancellor will still not include the repayment of war debts owed to the US in the budget, so he can leave sufficient surplus for his disposal. It is expected that Chamberlain will reduce the income tax from five shillings per pound to four shillings and six pence per pound, and will restore the salaries reduced in 1931. It is also hoped that the unemployment benefits previously cut during the financial panic will be restored in the future. In addition, the poor children's allowance under the unemployment relief plan can also be increased from two shillings per week to three shillings. It is estimated that the increase in the above two types of allowances will require approximately 7 million pounds. The Chancellor will also likely abolish the low-price seat donation in playgrounds to show consideration. (Seventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Commerce Plummets</h3>
<p>Roosevelt is Deeply Concerned</p>
<p>Plans to Establish a Clearing House to Save It</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Peek, President Roosevelt's international trade advisor, recently delivered a speech on US radio, saying that the United States has now realized that it can no longer be fooled by others. In recent years, 66 countries have signed commercial agreements with each other, abandoning the United States like worn shoes, causing US commerce in 1929 to plummet by 75%. Therefore, President Luo is deeply concerned about this. (For example, British commerce after the war also surpassed the US, while its commerce in the previous 20 years was not as good as the US.) In order to equalize its import commerce, the United States has decided to organize a commercial clearing house to manage its affairs, striving to balance prices and encourage the development of foreign trade.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Seeks to Improve Salt Revenue Inspection Office Administration</h3>
<p>Partial Sovereignty to be Recovered</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan reviewed the budget of the Ministry of Finance's Salt Revenue Inspection Office and found that the expenditures were excessive and should be reduced accordingly. It is learned that during the second year of the Republic (1913), Yuan Shikai, due to the Second Revolution and the independence of Jiangxi and Nanjing, in order to crush the revolution and consolidate his personal position, disregarded using salt revenue as the first guarantee and customs revenue as the second guarantee to borrow 200 million yuan from foreign banks, stipulating that it be repaid by the fortieth year of the Republic (1951). This loan, because it was signed in Shanghai, was called the Shanghai Loan at the time. Due to the loan relationship, all foreigners were used as inspectors, with particularly high salaries, even reaching 3,000 yuan per month. In recent years, only the coastal, Zhejiang, Huai, and Songjiang areas have remitted salt revenue to the central government, while others, such as Changlu, Sichuan, and Shandong, have been retained and not remitted, causing the first guarantee to become ineffective. It is now being paid from the second guarantee. The current government is determined to rectify the salt administration, gradually improve the administrative aspects of the Inspection Office, and, since the foreign debt is not a mortgage, seek to recover a portion of sovereignty. The number and salaries of foreign inspectors will be revised. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Achievements of the American Industrial Recovery (New York Correspondence)</h3>
<p>A Year in Review: Economy Not Improved, Labor and Management Still Opposed, Future Full of Thorns</p>
<p>New Measures to Reorganize the Blue Eagle Movement</p>
<p>President Roosevelt has just completed one year in office, since taking office last year. What are his achievements during this year? Anyone who pays attention to the current situation in the United States can have a considerable understanding. Even the most sympathetic are still dissatisfied with him. There are about two kinds of criticisms regarding Roosevelt's implementation of industrial recovery—the "Blue Eagle Movement." The first type believes that Roosevelt has indeed made his greatest efforts in the past year. Even if the results were not as expected, if he had not made such efforts, the United States would have been hit even harder by the economic panic. Therefore, considerable satisfaction should be expressed for the industrial recovery. The second type believes that Roosevelt's movement is a runaway train, using a lot of energy but not achieving much. He certainly made his greatest efforts, but the results obtained were too small.</p>
<p>The Blue Eagle Movement has been in effect for eight months now. Although prices rose slightly in September of last year, they fell again by the end of the year. Recently, there has been a tendency to plummet. Not only is it difficult to develop overseas markets temporarily, and Soviet orders are still very limited, but other places are also affected by economic panic. Moreover, there is still no sign of recovery to the prosperity before 1929 in the country. As a result, it has aroused resentment from many parties, especially labor and management. The reasons for the resentment are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The most fiercely debated and continuous issue is the right of workers to collective bargaining. According to Article 7 of the National Industrial Recovery Act, workers can organize themselves into groups, and the representatives of these groups can be elected by the labor union. They can enter into contracts with capitalists. The same article also guarantees that workers can join labor unions, support labor unions, and organize labor unions. Therefore, workers first organize local labor unions and then form national labor unions, using this strong solidarity to negotiate. On the capitalist side, they naturally dislike this kind of organization, and even do not recognize its existence. For example, US Steel Corporation refused to engage in collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America. These kinds of disputes are likely to be prolonged. (2) Shortening working hours, hiring workers, and guaranteeing minimum wages must lead to higher wages, which leads to higher prices. This is exactly the opposite of the spirit of the Blue Eagle Movement.</p>
<p>(3) Capitalists, in order to cover up their losses, always try to make the working capacity tight under the current situation, to produce more products. Therefore, capitalists take the offensive against workers, which is another major cause of disputes.</p>
<p>(4) The situation of workers has not actually improved much. Labor Secretary Perkins once said that by March of this year, only 2.5 million workers had been re-employed. There are at least 10 million unemployed in the United States, or even 15 to 16 million. However, wages increased by 10.6% from June to the end of last year, while the cost of living only increased by 5.4%. This is the result of the Blue Eagle Movement. However, according to the New Republic magazine, from June to December of last year, the personal wage index only increased by 3.7%, while the cost of living index increased by 5.4%. According to this, the result of the Blue Eagle Movement's income and expenditure calculation is that the workers' income is even below the poverty line in June of last year.</p>
<p>Because of this relationship, the American economic revolution, to the implementation of eight months later, re-encounter a new crisis. The people around the President are working hard to turn the current misfortune into future happiness. Therefore, before the 3,500 representatives of more than 600 industrial sectors in the United States, they strongly advocated strengthening the industrial recovery movement. The methods are: (1) The entire industrial sector, under the Blue Eagle cooperation, should raise wages and shorten working hours. (2) Relying solely on government spending cannot relieve unemployment. In the future, the entire industrial sector must work together. (3) Protect the industrial operations of small capital. (4) Maintain the anti-trust law and recognize fair free competition. (5) This kind of social organization transformation must be permanent. (6) Workers have the freedom to elect representatives to make collective contracts with employers. These are the methods to reorganize the Blue Eagle Movement. Whether it can succeed is still questionable. Moreover, the opposition between labor and management is gradually becoming acute. The stimulus of the military industry is only temporary and difficult to develop soundly. The situation in the United States is so shaky and unstable, and how can other parts of the world be any better? (March 4, 1934)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Massacre Righteous Army</h3>
<p>[Deng Tiemei Still Fighting Japan in the Triangle Area]</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Commander Deng Tiemei of the Righteous Army has been resisting Japan and saving the country in the Triangle Area since the September 18th Incident. Last winter in December, the Japanese and puppet troops launched a fifth offensive. As of April, they have not yet withdrawn, claiming that they will not withdraw until they have completely cleared the area. The Righteous Army and the Japanese and puppet troops have an average of one encounter every five or six days. According to statistics, the casualties on both sides are over 300. The Righteous Army often uses ambushes to win. Since February, the Japanese army, due to the failure of their offensive, has burned down all the houses in the mountains where the Righteous Army often gathers. Every time they capture officers and soldiers of the Righteous Army, they inflict suffering on them piecemeal, stabbing their bodies all over with knives, then having people slam them into the ground, or placing bombs in their crotches and detonating them, or using vicious dogs to tear them apart, or hitting their heads with stones. All kinds of cruel tortures are unspeakable.</p>
<h3>Liu Bandit Flees Back to Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Already Reached Xukou, Ju County</p>
<p>Shandong Army Continues to Encircle and Suppress</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The bandit troops of Liu Guitang, after being severely suppressed by General Han, suffering heavy casualties and with only a few hundred remnants left, fled in a sorry state to the border of Jiangsu province. After entering Jiangsu, they actually joined forces with Jiangsu bandits, increasing their numbers to over two thousand. On the evening of the 3rd, they attacked and captured Ganyu County. On the morning of the 4th, they fled southwest to the Shahe Yushan area. In order to exterminate the Liu bandits, the authorities of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces agreed to disregard provincial boundaries and jointly launch a severe suppression campaign to completely eliminate them in one fell swoop. The 22nd Division of the 3rd Route Army of Shandong Province, led by Gu Liangmin, the 20th Division led by Sun Tongxuan, and the cavalry regiment led by Li Xuande, entered Jiangsu in separate routes to pursue and suppress the bandits. Wang Jun, the commander of the 7th Division of the Jiangsu Army, also led heavy troops to deploy in the Dapu Xinpu area. Unexpectedly, just as they were preparing to encircle and suppress, Liu's bandits suddenly fled northeast from Shahe on the night of the 4th, lingering in the area west of Qingkou in southern Ganyu County, hoping to return to Shandong Province. The Shandong troops led by Gu Liangmin and Li Xuande arrived in the Shimenling area south of Ganyu City this morning (5th), where they joined forces with the Jiangsu army to launch an attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Liu bandits. Since the Liu bandits could not find a foothold in Jiangsu, they took advantage of the Shandong army's return to defense, dividing into two groups. They crossed the Ma Lu Mountain north from northern Jiangsu in the early morning, passed through Heilinzhen and entered Shandong Province, fleeing directly towards the area between Linyi and Ju County. In the morning, they passed through Tangjialou, Sangyuan, Shagou, Guanzhuang, Lijiake, Sanguishan, Zhongyu, Xialing, Bian Mountain, Zhushishan, and other places. At noon, they passed through Xingwangzhuang, Helepo, Dayu'ya, Caogou, Wangjiazhuang, and nearby areas, and then reached Shizilu, still fleeing northwest. In the afternoon, they passed through Youjiagouzi, Guandi, Liangdian, Diaoyutai, Huangjiamiaozi, Fangjialing, Xujialing, Wangjiaguanzhuang. Around 5 p.m., they arrived at Xukou, Xixukou, Baiyashan, and other areas near Dadian, only fifty or sixty li away from Ju County. The two groups of bandits converged in this area, numbering about seven or eight hundred people, and continued to flee. Their goal seemed to be to enter their old nest in Mount Meng.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, provincial governor Han Fuqu ordered Li Xuande to lead his cavalry regiment back to Shandong from Jiangsu to pursue them. He also ordered Sun Tongxuan to lead his troops to advance from northeast of Linyi, intercepting the Liu bandits from the side. He further ordered Xu Wenyao, who had already returned to defense, to lead his troops to Yishui, and Li Xiangchen's troops to proceed to Ju County, to meet and attack the Liu bandits separately. The directly subordinate troops of Gu Liangmin and the groups of Lin Binghai and Kang Zhankui under Ning Chunxiao's command, who had already entered Jiangsu, were also ordered to immediately return to Shandong. Ma Gui's brigade was to move from north of Tancheng back to south of Ju County to jointly encircle and suppress the Liu bandits. All troops were transported by motor vehicles, with the Dadianzhen area as the concentration point. It was estimated that they could reach their destinations separately that night. The Liu bandits were still under heavy military encirclement and suppression, and it was expected that the situation would be resolved soon (5th).</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The remnants of the Liu bandits fled south from Ganyu to Shahezhen, where they were attacked by Li Shilong of the 7th Division. They turned northwest and fled back to Huandun on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong. Li's brigade immediately pursued towards Huandun yesterday (5th), and the Shandong army also advanced from the north to encircle and suppress them. Wang Jun believed that the bandits were fleeing in large groups, making bombing effective, but their movements were uncertain and relied on reconnaissance. Therefore, he telegraphed Chairman Chiang the day before yesterday requesting air support. Yesterday, he received Chiang's reply, approving the dispatch of two Corsair aircraft to Xuzhou on the day of Bing, under Wang Jun's command, to fly to the front. According to a telegram received by the military headquarters today, the Liu bandits, numbering two thousand, had fled from Huandun to Jiagushan, Heilinzhen, and other nearby places. Jiagushan and Heilinzhen are located northeast of Huandun, forming a triangular terrain. Li's brigade urgently pursued and attacked, and Wu's group of the Shandong army besieged them, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits. They fled from the Daxushan area and this morning (6th) had fled to the vicinity of Dangshan southeast of Linyi. Li's brigade continued to pursue and had reached between Zhuduji and Chenjialou on the Jiangsu border, vowing to disregard provincial boundaries and assist in the suppression in Shandong. Wang planned to bomb them after the aircraft arrived. According to investigation, Liu Guitang was indeed among the bandits, and he was determined to completely exterminate them. Chen Guofu, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, telegraphed Xuzhou today, requesting Wang Jun to dispatch a team to Ganyu to maintain order. The military headquarters forwarded the telegram to the front, and Wang had dispatched a team to garrison the area and went to Caopu to supervise the troops. As the bandits fled north, he ordered Brigade Commander Li to advance and attack, and he went to Xin'anzhen today to oversee everything. Regarding the loss and recovery of Ganyu, according to a message received by Commissioner Wang Depu from Donghai Commissioner and a telegram received by County Magistrate Wang Gong from Donghai County Magistrate Kong, the bandits captured the city on the night of the 3rd and retreated on the afternoon of the 4th, staying in the city for half a day. County Magistrate Fu had led the police force to resist, but they were overwhelmed and the police captain was injured. He had now returned to the city to handle the aftermath. The 7th Division's troops could assist in maintaining order upon arrival. However, the bandits kidnapped women everywhere they went, causing great suffering to the people. (6th)</p>
<h3>Rumor of the Death in Battle of Bandit Leader Luo Binghui</h3>
<p>｜｜Collapse of Pseudo 1359 Military Corps｜｜</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Military sources report that the main force of the National Army's 4th Division, after occupying Xinqiao in western Fujian last month, was attacked by no less than 30,000 troops from the pseudo 1st Military Corps' 1st and 2nd Divisions, the pseudo 3rd Military Corps' 4th and 5th Divisions, the pseudo 5th Military Corps' 13th Division, and the pseudo 9th Military Corps' 34th Division. Starting from the 25th, they launched alternating attacks day and night. However, the National Army officers and soldiers fought bravely, and by the 26th, the bandits were completely defeated. In this battle, the bandits suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and the losses of pseudo cadres were particularly heavy. There is a rumor that the bandit leader Luo Binghui was killed in action, and fifty or sixty bandit guns were seized. The official side also suffered more than 200 casualties. Recently, the bandit forces have suffered repeated heavy blows, and their morale and supplies are depleted. Therefore, whenever they engage with the National Army, they are routed and easily defeated.</p>
<p>Another report states that the General Headquarters yesterday received a report from Division Commander Pei You, stating that his division conducted a search and suppression operation from the Getengshan Luanni area and encountered the pseudo 28th Army near Hongshiyan. After a fierce battle lasting all day, the bandits were finally defeated and fled towards the Badaohe area that evening. In this battle, hundreds of bandits were killed and many guns were captured. The National Army suffered only a few soldier casualties, etc.</p>
<p>Another report states that Yu Hanmou reported that the entire pseudo 22nd Division, numbering over a thousand, came from Huichang yesterday, intending to attack the Tianxinwei Anti-Communist Corps. He dispatched a certain unit of Li's division to search and suppress them. When they arrived at the Wulongying area, they encountered the bandits. After a fierce battle lasting all day, the officers and soldiers bravely defeated them, killing or wounding over two hundred bandits, capturing over seventy guns, and taking over forty bandit officers and soldiers as prisoners, etc. (April 6th)</p>
<h3>Wang and Chiang Discuss the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Wang Calls for Clear Definition of Simplicity</p>
<p>Chiang Advocates Starting with Order and Cleanliness</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the New Life Movement Conference held in the capital by party, government, and military circles on the 29th of last month, Wang Zhaoming sent two telegrams to Chairman Chiang one after another, discussing the methods of implementation and the scope to be advocated at present. The telegrams between Wang and Chiang are recorded below: (1) Wang's telegram stated: "[Reading the newspaper, I learned that you are promoting the New Life Movement, which I greatly admire. I have no objection to any of the points, but the point of simplicity seems to need a clear definition. One concern is that excessive interference may turn into harassing the people, and another concern is that those who implement it may be too ostentatious and become hypocritical. For example, last year's National Goods Parade in Beijing actually led to calls to overthrow Western suits, causing great panic among domestic woolen fabric manufacturers, and some advocating for cloth clothing caused great panic in the silk industry. These must be taken into account. I briefly present my views for reference. If you could share the specific methods and content, it would be greatly appreciated for me to respond in Beijing. [Brother] Zhaoming [sealed]", (2) Chiang's reply telegram one, stated, "[Your opinions are highly appreciated. Since the New Life Movement began, the atmosphere has been refreshed, but it is only a preliminary experiment. The items were originally intended to start with the movement of order and the area was intended to start in Nanchang. After it has been effectively implemented and experiences accumulated, it will be extended to other areas. There are too many aspects of our lives that need to be reformed. If everything is done at the same time, it will be too much and neglected, and it will only repeat the past mistakes of slogans and propaganda, or it may be overcorrected and turn into harassing the people. I am also worried about this. I am sending the methods and contents proposed here for your detailed correction. I hope that it can be carefully considered and completed, and then promoted in Beijing to show the national benchmark, which is even more anticipated. Zhongzheng [sealed]", Chiang's reply telegram two, stated, "[Your insightful views are highly admirable. The New Life Movement, in other words, is the improvement of old bad habits. If we want it to be effective, I think it must be from simple to complex, from shallow to deep, public before private, extend to others, from near to far, and from small to large. Therefore, the types of movement may be temporarily limited to order and cleanliness. The steps to take are to set an example, show people a model. All civil servants and students should take the lead in practicing it, advocate for society, emphasize influence rather than coercion, and guide before discipline. Even if discipline must be implemented, it should be limited to civil servants and students, not the common people. The places where discipline is implemented should be limited to institutions, schools, roads, docks, theaters, hotels, and all public places, not private residences. If the people promote it themselves and encourage each other, this belongs to the scope of people's self-governance, which should be implemented by neighborhood associations setting their own rules. The state should not impose mandatory laws, and especially should not be handled by party, government, and military personnel alone, which would lose the people's interest in participating. Moreover, the theory of life is different from the theory of morality. All so-called four no's, six no's, or eight precepts, ten commandments, are mostly personal cultivation and moral issues of mutual encouragement among friends, and should not be mixed into the New Life Movement, which would cause confusion and lose its universal and simple nature, and turn into hypocrisy and decoration. These are my humble opinions. I wonder if they are in line with your views. In addition to sending a separate telegram to the New Life Movement Promotion Association to discuss in detail with the comrades, I also hope to be taught. Zhongzheng Jiang, [sealed]", (April 6th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Kang (Xikang) Inspection Team Returns East from Chongqing</h3>
<p>Both Northern and Southern Groups Arrive in Chongqing Simultaneously</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The Sichuan-Kang Inspection Team's Southern Group, upon returning to Ya'an in western Sichuan from Xikang, planned to take bamboo rafts down the Ya River the next day. However, due to the raft owner's inability to carry cargo, it was repeatedly delayed. It wasn't until the morning of March 22nd that they left Cangpingshan and boarded the bamboo raft waiting in the Ya River. They untied the cable and traveled southeast, passing through several dangerous rapids and whirlpools. In the evening, they stayed at Luoba Chang, which belongs to Hongya County. At dawn on the 23rd, the bamboo raft continued downstream, passing through Hongya County and reaching Jiajiang County. They went ashore to visit the county government. The county has a population of 170,000 and produces a lot of bamboo. They use young bamboo to make paper, which is quite white. There are many large and small local paper mills, and many families rely on papermaking as a household industry. The trade volume is about two to three million yuan annually. On the 24th, they traveled fifty li by rickshaw from Jiajiang County to Emei County. Because Mount Emei was nearby, they climbed one-third of Mount Emei on the 25th, about forty li, and stayed at Wannian Temple. They went down the mountain on the 26th. In just three days, they only climbed half of Mount Emei. On the 27th, they traveled eighty li from Emei County to Leshan (formerly Jiading Prefecture). The scenery along the way was extremely beautiful, like a painting. The fields were connected horizontally and vertically, resembling the scenery of the Jiangnan region. Recalling the situation on the border between Sichuan and Kang, it was like a wasteland. Leshan is an important town in southwestern Sichuan with flourishing commerce. It covers an area of 9,600 square li, 180 li long and 70 li wide. The whole county has more than 70,000 households, and the city and suburbs have more than 6,000 households, with a total population of 300,000. There are 33 factories. The main trade includes silk production of 4,524,000 taels per year, porcelain production of twenty kilns per year, about 12,000 pieces, white wax production of 54,000 catties per year, and Jialu alkali plant producing 600,000 catties of alkali. The whole county produces 22,400 pieces of thick silk, 8,000 salt tickets, each ticket is 8,000 catties, and 10,290 tons of coal. On the 28th, they stayed in Leshan for a day and went outside the city to visit the Jialu Paper Mill, the Huaxin Silk Mill, and the Jialu Alkali Plant. The scale was small and the production was not much, only meeting the needs of nearby cities and counties. On the 29th, they took a wooden boat from Leshan and went downstream along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. That day, they stayed in the territory of Qianwei County. On the 30th, they arrived at Niuguan Chang, about forty li from Yibin (Xufu). Because the Sichuan River was dangerous, they could not travel by boat at night and stayed there. On the morning of the 31st, they started the boat downstream and arrived in Yibin at about 8 o'clock. They went to the Yibin branch of the Sichuan River Navigation Administration for a visit. There happened to be an Yizhou ship waiting to depart, so they transferred to that ship immediately. They lifted anchor at noon and stopped in Luzhou that evening. On the evening of April 1st, they arrived in Chongqing, and the members of the Northern Group, Zhang, Chen, and Liu, happened to return east from Chengdu at the same time, arriving in Chongqing at the same time, which was truly a coincidence. After negotiations in Chongqing, it was decided to take the Minsheng Company's Minzhu ship east to Shanghai on the 7th, ending the Sichuan-Kang inspection tour. The materials on the Kang-Tibet issue obtained by the reporter will also be published after boarding the ship.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Sends Teams to Supervise the Eradication of Opium Seedlings</h3>
<p>｜｜Much Secret Planting in Hechao Area｜｜</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, in order to strictly prohibit opium, in addition to strictly checking the opium lamp licenses to prevent any omissions, so as to ban them within a limited time, he is also very serious about checking and eradicating opium seedlings. He previously sent Ma Lanfu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Cai Bingyan, Director of the Provincial Security Department, to Yingzhou, Shouxian, Haoxian, Guoyang, and other places in northern Anhui, and Hefei, Chaoxian, and other places in central Anhui to investigate whether there was any secret planting. In northern Anhui, due to strict supervision in recent years, there was little planting. However, in the area bordering Hefei, Chaoxian, and Hanshan counties in central Anhui, there was a lot of opium seedling planting, especially in Chaoxian, where it was everywhere. Cai Bingyan, Director of the Security Department, urged the county governments to send teams to supervise the eradication. However, the villagers there, believing that their livelihoods were at stake, vowed to resist to the death and were openly protected by thousands of members of the Red Spear Society. After the provincial government received the news, it was extremely angry and telegraphed Wang Baozhai, the Administrative Inspector and Security Commander of the Second District of Wuhu, ordering him to transfer two security teams from Wuhu to eradicate them. After receiving the telegram, Wang transferred the First and Third Squadrons under Wuhu County to the Jiang'an River for assembly on the morning of the 1st, led by Deputy Brigade Commander Ren Luyi, and took a special ship to Chaoxian to direct the eradication. If the Red Spear Society still disregarded the law and dared to resist, they should be suppressed and arrested. Hong Ziyuan, the county magistrate of Chaoxian, came to Wuhu yesterday to ask for instructions on this matter and also returned with the team. Currently, the Red Spear Society and ignorant villagers in that county have gathered a large number of people, and the situation seems quite serious. (1st)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Stipulates Measures for Unified Management and Control of Fertilizers</h3>
<p>Passed and Implemented by the Provincial Government Meeting</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: In order to prevent the harms of artificial fertilizers, promote natural fertilizers, and increase agricultural production, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specially stipulated the Jiangsu Province Unified Management and Control of Fertilizers Measures, which was passed by the 646th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. The measures and explanations are as follows: [Measures, Article 1: The Jiangsu Provincial Government specially stipulates the Jiangsu Province Unified Management and Control of Fertilizers Measures in order to prevent the harms of artificial fertilizers, promote natural fertilizers, and increase agricultural production. Article 2: All kinds of fertilizers imported into Jiangsu Province, whether natural fertilizers or chemical fertilizers, may be subject to unified management and control by the Department of Construction as necessary. Article 3: The Department of Construction shall investigate the needs of farmers at any time and directly or entrust reliable merchants to handle fertilizer operations, but with the principle of promoting the sale of domestic natural fertilizers as a priority, and may prohibit or restrict the free export or import of various fertilizers when necessary, or order the importers to make appropriate matching of various fertilizers. Article 4: All fertilizers that have been designated for unified management and control, except for those operated by the Department of Construction or the entrusted merchants, shall be concentrated at the place of departure by the importer fifteen days before the scheduled departure date, fill out a report form, and submit it to the Department of Construction or its entrusted agency for inspection, together with the marketing certificate and component analysis form issued by the Commodity Inspection Bureau. Only after affixing the approval certificate can it be allowed to depart. Those who have not gone through the aforementioned procedures or are found to have forged or adulterated goods shall be prohibited from importing. The aforementioned report form shall state the place of delivery, and after verification, it shall not be changed at will. After delivery, a certificate shall be obtained from the local government agency and sent to the original approving agency for record. Article 5: All fertilizer stores opened in Jiangsu Province, except for those directly entrusted by the Department of Construction or specially contracted by entrusted merchants, whether wholesale or retail, must go through the following procedures.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>(1) New operators shall, fifteen days before opening, submit the name of the store, location, total capital, types of fertilizers sold, name of the manager, etc., to the Department of Construction for approval and issuance of a license before they can open. (Fertilizer stores that have already opened before the promulgation of these measures shall complete the above procedures within ten days after the promulgation of these measures). (2) Fertilizer stores that have been licensed to open shall, within ten days after obtaining the license, fill out a report form, stating the types and quantities of fertilizers prepared for sale this year, and submit the registration fee according to the following standards to the Department of Construction for review and registration, and issuance of a registration certificate. Those who have not registered shall not be allowed to operate. A. Natural fertilizers are exempt from registration fees. B. Chemical fertilizers are two jiao per package (each package is 100 kilograms). The aforementioned registration certificate shall be renewed once a year in January. Natural fertilizers that have undergone manufacturing procedures shall be regarded as chemical fertilizers. Article 6: Fertilizer stores shall not sell more fertilizer than their registered amount each year, except for those directly entrusted by the Department of Construction or specially contracted by entrusted merchants. If it is necessary to exceed the amount, they shall first state the reasons and submit them to the Department of Construction for approval and pay double the registration fee. Article 7: The Department of Construction may send personnel to inspect various fertilizer import locations and fertilizer stores at any time. If it is found that there is a violation of the provisions of these measures, a fine of 10% to 90% of the original price of the goods may be imposed, and the goods may be confiscated. Article 8: The agricultural extension stations of each county shall send personnel to various townships at any time to investigate the fertilizer application situation of farmers and report to the Department of Construction for verification. If it is found that there are errors in the application method, they shall immediately guide and correct them. Article 9: Fertilizer stores in this province shall select store clerks to take turns attending training at the Department of Construction. When farmers purchase fertilizers, they shall first inquire about the planting area, soil condition, crop type, and growth status, and sell them accordingly. Article 10: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. (Explanation) (1) After the promulgation of these measures, the Department of Construction shall designate chemical fertilizers for unified management and control first, and entrust the Agricultural Product Marketing Office of the Farmers Bank to handle fertilizer operations. Because the measures stipulate that registration fees and license fees must be paid, except for those operated by the Department of Construction or the entrusted merchants, the procedures are extremely complicated, so in the future, all the original fertilizer stores in this province will have to purchase fertilizers from the Farmers Bank. (2) The fertilizer business of the whole province is concentrated in the Farmers Bank, which is not only easy to manage, but also can obtain considerable income. (3) Previously, the chemical fertilizer stores in each county purchased fertilizers from foreign merchants in Shanghai, and the prices and goods were controlled by them. In the future, when the Farmers Bank purchases fertilizers, it can adopt bidding methods to make the foreign merchants compete with each other or reduce the selling price. (4) At present, the selling price of chemical fertilizers in each county is freely determined by the fertilizer stores, which is extremely inconsistent. Every time the fertilization period arrives, they arbitrarily raise the selling price, which makes the farmers suffer greatly. In the future, it will be uniformly stipulated by the Department of Construction to ensure uniformity]. (5th)</p>
<h3>Overview of Japan's Opium Policy in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Currently, There are More Than 9 Million Opium Addicts</p>
<p>Annual Consumption Reaches 518.4 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese implement an opium monopoly policy in the puppet organization, with the intention of both obtaining economic income and poisoning and destroying our Northeast race, which is a cunning plan and a particularly poisonous heart. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Currently, the Japanese have established an Opium Monopoly Bureau in Changchun, and branches have been established in major cities, and distribution offices have been established in various counties. The Bureau has the right to audit the entire territory's opium production, sales, distribution, and punish private sellers. The branches perform the same responsibilities within their designated areas. The rights to financial revenue and expenditure and the punishment of private sellers are all controlled by the Japanese. Currently, there are forty monopoly offices in Jilin, and each office can bring in at least 200 yuan per day, totaling about 8,000 yuan. Changchun has been changed to the puppet capital, and the number of people has greatly increased compared to before, so its opium income is also doubled compared to Jilin city. The opium sold in Liaoning is even more than in Jilin, with daily sales of 10,000 yuan. The sales in the Harbin area are even greater, with a daily income of 16,000 yuan. As for Heilongjiang, Xing'an, and Rehe, because they are located in remote areas, the individual income can be estimated at half of Jilin's, but each place can still earn 4,000 yuan per day, totaling 12,000 yuan for the three places. In total, the above places can sell at least 50,000 yuan of opium per day, which shows that the Japanese blackening policy is difficult to calculate the harm.</p>
<p>Xi Qia, the puppet Minister of Finance, ordered by the Japanese, especially designated opium planting areas in eastern provinces for management. It is estimated that Fengtian designated Changbai, Fusong, Antu, and Linjiang counties, Jilin designated Yanji, Wangqing, Helong, Hunchun, Dongning, Ning'an, Muling, Boli, Mishan, Hulin, Huachuan, Fujin, Tongjiang, Ningqing, Raohe, Fuyuan, Yilan, and other seventeen counties due to suitable soil. The planting in Fengtian and Jilin provinces is mostly adjacent to the Korean border, which the Japanese require for easy protection. Heilongjiang has not designated an area due to its colder geology and unsuitability for planting. Although Rehe has few counties, it is known for its opium production, so it designated Chaoyang, Fuxin, Kailu, Lubei, Tianshan, Lindong, Chifeng, Jianping, Weichang, Lingyuan, Lingnan, Pingyuan, Chengde, Jianping, Fengning, and other sixteen counties. It can be said that the poisoning has spread throughout the Northeast. The number of mu to be planted has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese implemented the opium poisoning policy for more than two years, the victims have accounted for one-third of the population. According to a survey published by the puppet Ministry of Civil Affairs, opium smokers under the age of fifteen account for 13%, those under the age of twenty-five account for 23%, and those under the age of thirty account for 33%, with a real number of more than 9 million people. Among the 30 million compatriots, one-third of the population has been poisoned by opium. Calculating each person smoking four qian per day, the total amount of opium smoked throughout the year is 12.96 million guan (each guan is 7.5 catties), and each qian is calculated at 4 jiao, totaling 518.4 million yuan.

<p>The Jiaodiao Bay Police Station Was Destroyed</p>
<p>Wang Jiaxiang, No. 31 Tu in Jiaodiao Bay Township, belonged to a farmer Youfu, who owed several hundred cash to Sun Yuelongjiang, a wind instrument player from Lujiabang. Sun and his old mother went to Zhong's place to collect the debt. Unexpectedly, Sun's mother and Yuelong were insulted and scolded by Zhong, followed by a vicious beating. Sun was unwilling to accept this and reported it to the Jiaodiao Bay Police Station. Zhong did not appear when summoned. Zhong did not repent but instead dared to gather many people and went to the Jiaodiao Bay Police Station to seek revenge. With a crowd of voices, they smashed the doors and windows of the police station. Seeing that he was no match for them, the patrol chief secretly notified the patrol police to notify the Gendarmerie stationed at Yangqiao, No. 31, to rush to the scene to stop them. Two accomplices, Shen Xiuhai and Zhong Xinglin (Youfu's son), were caught on the spot. The patrol police at the station also caught the main offender, Zhong Youfu. They were escorted to the Second Branch Bureau. Wang, the director of the branch bureau, sent patrol chiefs Li Yaokun and Liu Yuming to investigate and verify the facts. Documents were prepared and sent to the Public Security Bureau and then to the Procuratorate for interrogation and handling.</p>

<h3>Opposition to the Public Burial of Xing Guangshi</h3>
<p>Xing Guangshi, a native of this county, devoted more than ten years of his energy to inventing a lightweight textile machine. Unexpectedly, he died of illness before it was completed. His family applied to the National Government for a pension of 10,000 yuan and ordered the county government to allocate 3,000 yuan and 50 mu of public land for Xing's burial. The machine was handed over to the Academia Sinica for continued research. Later, Huang Xijie and others, natives of the county, argued that Xing was from Nantong and was not registered in this county, so he should not be buried by this county. They repeatedly petitioned to stop it. Therefore, the issue of Xing's burial has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Labor-Management Dispute at Dasheng No. 2 Factory</h3>
<p>Dasheng No. 2 Factory has been shut down for half a year, and the workers have suffered greatly. They have repeatedly requested to resume work, but the management stated that the bank group did not approve the loan, making it difficult to resume. In mid-February of this year, it was announced that the factory would be dissolved. The workers expressed their opposition, leading to a dispute. The other day, the Qidong County Government convened representatives from both sides to discuss and mediate, and the following conditions were decided: (1) The Dasheng No. 2 Factory will actively plan to resume work by the board of directors. The date of resuming operations is set for November 1, 23rd year of the Republic. However, if there is a turnaround in the yarn and cloth market before the deadline, the factory should resume operations in advance. If the yarn and cloth market is still sluggish and the financial situation is stagnant by the deadline, the date may be extended as appropriate. (2) When operations are resumed in the future, the old ordinary workers and mechanics, except for the elderly and those incapable of working, should be given priority in employment according to the actual number of people needed in the factory. The factory and the labor union will jointly identify them before the resumption of operations. (3) The severance pay for ordinary workers will be based on two months of the original salary, with each month counted as 30 days. However, the half-month salary borrowed last year will be deducted accordingly. (4) The severance pay for mechanics should be higher than that for ordinary workers, and the severance pay for staff should be higher than that for mechanics. The amount will be discussed separately by both parties. (5) The losses suffered by the workers during the period from the shutdown to the dissolution of the Second Factory will be handled by the labor union after listing the reasons based on the Factory Law and submitting them for explanation and compliance. (6) At the end of the past year, the factory allowed each ordinary worker to be given two dou of corn. It should be reissued within ten days. (7) All severance payments should be paid off within 20 days from the date of mediation. (8) Regarding the labor union's request to issue 7,500 yuan of travel expenses to the workers, the factory representatives should state the suffering of the workers to the board of directors of the Second Factory, and the county government representatives should send a letter to the board of directors, asking them to consider the difficulties of the workers and make efforts to issue the expenses. However, this issue should not affect the above seven articles of the mediation decision. Accompanying mediation items: The Dasheng Hospital and Dasheng Primary School should be maintained by the factory by any means. The above mediation matters were recognized by both parties without objection, and three identical written records were made. Each party's representative signed and sealed them. In addition to the labor-management parties each holding one copy, one copy was kept by the Qidong County Government for record.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<h3>Zhou Fo-hai Visits Wuxi for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Zhou Fo-hai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Yang Shuhui, and others, came to Wuxi from the province for sightseeing around ten or eleven o'clock in the morning on the day before yesterday. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, upon hearing the news, greeted them at the station and accompanied them to Washington Hotel for lunch. Yesterday morning (7th) at nine o'clock, County Magistrate Yan and his wife accompanied them to visit scenic spots such as Huishan Meiyuan and Xiaojishan. According to reports, Gu Renfa's whereabouts have been unknown since he went to Beijing the day before yesterday. Regarding the saying that Cheng Tianfang and Yu Jingtang would be chosen to succeed the Director of Civil Affairs Department, it is necessary to wait for the decision of the Executive Yuan meeting, etc. Also, Chen Guofu, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, took a military commission's self-provided car from Zhenjiang to Yixing on the 7th, passing through the Yixi Road to the county's Meiyuan to visit scenic spots. Chen arrived at Meiyuan at five o'clock in the afternoon and then went to Xiaojishan and Yuantouzhu and other places to visit. It is heard that he had to return to Zhenjiang that night. Chen's visit to Wuxi this time was purely for sightseeing.</p>
<h3>Wuxi to Construct an Airfield</h3>
<p>In order to develop private aviation, the Aviation Administration plans to construct an airfield of more than 800 meters square outside the former prefectural cities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, about ten miles away from the city, and pay attention to the selection of locations that (1) can connect to roads, (2) are easier to drain, and (3) have simple construction. It has been decided that the six counties in Jiangsu Province are: (1) Suzhou, (2) Zhenjiang, (3) Wuxi, (4) Yangzhou, (5) Songjiang, and (6) Wujin.</p>
<h3>The Qinfeng Labor Strike is Serious</h3>
<p>The female workers in the weaving workshop of Qinfeng Yarn Factory No. 1 Workshop started a strike because the female cloth inspectors were too strict in their inspections and the fines were too harsh. The next day, the two departments of weaving in No. 1 Workshop completely stopped work, and the situation gradually expanded. However, No. 2 Workshop still worked as usual and was not affected at all. However, the factory stated that the cloth evaluation room destroyed the cloth evaluation tables and account books that day, causing serious damage. Fearing other accidents, it specially reported to both the party and government for maintenance. The county government also considered the labor strike to be serious and was concerned that unscrupulous elements might be causing trouble. It immediately discussed with the county party headquarters and specially dispatched the county police brigade to guard the factory. Unexpectedly, this caused a conflict between the female workers and the police team. On the afternoon of the 6th, three to four hundred female workers gathered at the yarn factory industry union on Wanqian Road and formulated four conditions: (1) punish the murderers, (2) release the arrested female worker Bao Afeng, (3) ask the county government to appropriately subsidize the medical expenses of the injured, and (4) the factory will pay the wages for the strike period as usual. After the decision, they were about to petition the party and government agencies, but they were stopped by members sent by the county party headquarters to explain the situation separately. However, some female workers, believing that the police team was still protecting the factory, planned to bring lime bags to the factory to retaliate. The police team, upon hearing the news, immediately strengthened their defenses, closed the factory alley doors, prohibited passage, and prepared fire hydrants for resistance. The situation was extremely serious. The county party headquarters received news beforehand and immediately sent cadre Zhao Xuchang to the factory to inquire about the truth. Wang Wei, the captain of the county police brigade, also personally went to maintain order and arranged everything very closely. Therefore, although there were many female workers, fortunately, no accidents occurred. However, the female workers of No. 2 Workshop were blocked from going to work by the striking female workers holding incense sticks. That night, after nine o'clock, Ye Dezhen, the secretary of the county government, together with Wang, the captain of the police team, and Yao, the director of the trial division, went to the county party headquarters to consult with committee members Gui Wochen and Xu Yongji twice. The factory proposed that the punishment of the murderers should be the premise for starting work, in order to appease the labor side’s demands for increased wages and reduced fines. It was decided that Committee Member Gui would convene representatives of the workers to guide and inquire about the person in charge of causing trouble. As of yesterday (7th) morning, Committee Member Xu of the county party headquarters and Secretary Ye of the county government jointly consulted with the Chamber of Commerce and decided on the principles: (1) The Qinfeng Yarn Factory Labor-Management Dispute Review Committee will hold a meeting immediately for review and approval. (2) The six foremen of the cloth machine room in No. 1 Workshop of the factory will be responsible in writing for ensuring that no other incidents occur in the future, as a guarantee for the factory from now on. The above two items will be negotiated with both the labor and management sides by the party and government. However, the kitchen of No. 2 Workshop (i.e., the new factory) has been completely occupied by the striking female workers, and many important workers in the machine room have also been persuaded to leave, making it impossible to work. The situation still shows signs of expansion.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<h3>A Traitor Sets Fire to Tongcheng Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>The Tongcheng Yarn Factory, located near Dingyan outside the East Gate of Wu County, was previously leased to Jiuji Company for business. Recently, Jiuji Company ceased operations and was taken back for self-management on March 30. At approximately one o'clock in the morning on the 7th, the bamboo fence on the west side of the factory was torn down. When factory staff and police discovered it and were about to investigate, they suddenly saw that the guardhouse outside the gate of the goods warehouse on the south side and the guardhouse outside the main gate on the east side were on fire. All staff and factory police worked hard to extinguish the fire. Two guardhouses and about three intervals of bamboo fence were burned. Traces of straw and kerosene were found in the guardhouses, indicating that unscrupulous people intentionally set the fire. Fortunately, it was discovered early, preventing it from spreading and causing a major disaster. The incident was reported to the County Government Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shops Request Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The area west of the main street in Wu County is the most bustling. However, business has plummeted in recent years, and rents are high. In accordance with the precedents set in Shanghai and Suzhou, a tenants' association has been organized to carry out a rent reduction movement. A meeting was held at the Shuonan Public Office on the afternoon of the 7th, and a preparatory meeting was scheduled for the 15th to complete the registration procedures in order to proceed with negotiations.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<h3>Opposite-Sex Companion Trip Almost Caused a Fatal Incident</h3>
<p>Slender West Lake outside the North Gate of Yangzhou is crowded with tourists every Spring Festival. This year's Qingming Festival had fine weather, and there were even more tourists. As the sun was setting, by the Great Rainbow Bridge, a beautiful young woman, accompanied by a young man who looked like a worker, was sharing a small boat, talking and laughing freely. Unexpectedly, the woman's father saw them and mistook them for lovers. He angrily ordered the boat to stop. When the woman saw that her father's voice and expression were stern, she was afraid and jumped into the lake. Fortunately, boatman Xiao Yu was agile and pulled her onto the small boat. She was barely breathing. He quickly administered artificial respiration and she thankfully revived. Later, the boatman proved that they had boarded the boat at different times and each paid 500 cash. The woman's father's anger subsided slightly. It was learned that the woman's name was Qiu Xiaozhen and she lived in a small alley behind Guangchumen. The young man's surname was Li, and he was a clerk in a Xu's grocery store in Xu Ningmen. They were strangers to each other. It was inferred that the misunderstanding occurred because they were sharing a boat, almost leading to a fatal incident. It was indeed a close call.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<h3>Water Patrol Team Searches County Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Zhu Chunlin, a patrol officer of the Water Patrol Team, led more than ten armed patrolmen to the County Party Headquarters at approximately 11:00 PM last night and searched the office and the bedrooms of the staff. All the staff were awakened from their dreams. When asked for the reason, the patrol officer claimed that he was acting on the instructions of Captain Chen and could not refuse. They had no choice but to allow the search, which resulted in all the documents and equipment in each room being in disarray. Finally, Yuan Geng, a party member dispatched by the Second Directly Subordinate District Branch to the city to collect the preliminary party member forms, was dragged out of bed and arrested. The County Department believed that the Water Patrol Team abused its power, broke into the Party Headquarters late at night and searched arbitrarily, privately arrested party members, acted illegally and recklessly to the extreme. Therefore, they have telegraphed the province for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<h3>Implementation of Tolls for Urban and Rural Telephones</h3>
<p>Each rural area in this county is equipped with urban and rural telephones, the expenses of which are borne by each district. The former director of the exchange proposed to charge for telephone calls, which was opposed by local people and stopped. It is now learned that the Construction Department plans to transfer the urban and rural telephones in this county to provincial management, merge them with the provincial long-distance telephone bureau, and implement telephone charges in rural areas. Shan Bao-Ci has been dispatched on the 5th to Changshu to take over. The handover has been completed by Pan Xizu, the director of the exchange in this county. Now, local people here believe that urban and rural telephones were established with local funding, originally to facilitate smooth communication of defense news. Now that tolls are charged, people cannot afford it. Some people have already raised objections.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<h3>Bodyguard's Accidental Shot Claims Three Lives</h3>
<p>Yan Axing, a farmer from Maoxia, Yushan Township, Yinjiang Bridge, 7th District of Yin County, is 35 years old. He has a mother in her sixties, and his wife, Xu, is 25 years old. She gave birth to a boy just three days ago. Because Axing was on duty this year, he bought meat at the market the day before Qingming (i.e., the 4th) for use. At that time, Zhang, the squad leader of the 3rd District Bodyguard Group stationed at the Yaowang Temple in Zhangcun, led seven armed bodyguards through Maoxia on the highway. Unexpectedly, Axing suddenly turned pale when he saw the armed bodyguards and ran wildly home with the meat. One of the bodyguards, seeing Axing running wildly, suspected that he was not a good person and chased him to his door. He fired a shot from a wooden-cased gun, hitting Axing's vital point. He immediately fell to the ground and died. At the time, Xu was feeding her child in bed. Suddenly hearing the gunshot, she asked what had happened and learned that Axing had been killed. She cried out loudly, and her lower body bled profusely. She died instantly. Axing's mother was caressing Axing's body and crying bitterly. Hearing the sound, she looked back and saw that her daughter-in-law had also died from bleeding. Looking at her newly born grandson, he was also crushed to death by his mother's arm. Four members of the family died instantly, and she was overwhelmed with grief. She went to the city that night and petitioned the Yin County District Court yesterday (the 5th) afternoon at 7:00 PM, requesting justice. Prosecutor Weng opened the court for questioning, comforted her, and ordered her to return. This morning, he went to the village to examine the body in order to handle the case.</p>
<h3>The Puxing Steamer Returns Safely</h3>
<p>The Puxing Steamer, which travels between Ningbo and Shengshan, was sailing from Yong to Dinghai yesterday (the 3rd) morning and did not stop. It continued south. Chaoyang Steamer caught sight of it and knew it had been robbed. It reported to the Dinghai Puxing Branch, which requested the Water Police Team to send a warship to pursue. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday (the 4th) afternoon at 1:00 PM, Puxing Company received two telegrams from Dinghai Puxing Branch: (1) Puxing Steamer arrived in Dinghai at 12:00 PM today and will depart for Yong immediately.

<h3>Conflict Between Actors and Kiln Workers Turns into Tragedy</h3>
<p>Dramas have been performed day and night in Ganyaozhen recently. The night before last, more than 20 kiln workers from the Pan Qiantai Tile Factory did not purchase tickets and tried to enter to watch the drama, but they were stopped by the gatekeepers. The kiln workers insisted on entering, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. The fighting was quite fierce. For a time, the audience fled, and the order was disrupted. The stage stools and utensils in the theater were destroyed. A portion of the kiln workers rushed to the actors' boat and dismantled the shed and sundries. At that time, the local small workers from the nearby kiln factory heard the news and came to help, gathering more than 100 people. The local security police were unable to suppress them. As a result, many people on both sides were seriously injured, especially Chen Xiaohua on the kiln worker's side, who was the most seriously injured and feared for his life. Zhou Apei on the actor's side also suffered serious head and chest injuries. He went to Suzhou for medical treatment that night. It is rumored that he died on the way. After the court examined Chen Xiaohua's injuries, he will file a lawsuit, but the actors are not willing to show weakness.</p>

<h3>The Reaction to Schurman's Speech: Maddi Expresses His Opinion</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Dr. Schurman, former U.S. Minister to China, gave a speech at the weekly luncheon of the American Club in Paris on the 5th, saying that China was still far from unification and that the central government's power only extended to five of the eighteen provinces, with the remaining thirteen provinces still in the hands of warlords unrestrained by the central government. Mr. Maddi, General Manager of the Maddi Motor Company, an American business in this port, was very displeased upon seeing this. Yesterday, he invited reporters from various Chinese and Western newspapers to publicly express his views as follows: "[Dr.] Schurman was well-informed during his tenure as Minister to China, which is beyond doubt. However, he has been away from China for a long time now and cannot truly observe the various progress that China is making, all of which is greatly related to China's unification. It should be known that China today is making progress in all aspects and should no longer be criticized with the perspective of years ago. I have been paying attention to China's efforts to unify. I feel that previously, the focus was entirely on political aspects, often neglecting geographical obstacles. However, due to the importance of transportation, work is now underway to connect the provinces. Therefore, I know that if Dr. Schurman were aware of China's recent developments, he would not make such a statement but would instead adopt an optimistic tone. Dr. Schurman should pay attention to the great progress in China's highway transportation and communication in recent years. He should understand the relationship of this force to the Chinese government's success in suppressing bandits and quelling rebellions in remote areas. He should realize the importance of modern transportation in suppressing the Fujian rebellion. Furthermore, he should pay attention to the Chinese government's plan and efforts to develop Xinjiang Province. If Dr. Schurman knew the progress China is making in geographically connecting the provinces, he would also recognize that China is moving toward a common goal socially, politically, and economically, and he would change his tone and realize he had misspoken. I believe that China's unification was previously misled by geographical obstacles. Fortunately, this weakness has been recognized. In recent years, thousands of miles of highways have been actively built, which has greatly helped the central government control the provinces. As for the highways that are being built and planned, it can be asserted that they will help the Nanjing government expand its power. Until recently, the United States was still a federation, but because of the development of road transportation and communication, it is now completely a single country. Given time, this road-building movement in China will surely achieve the same result. I think Dr. Schurman will also acknowledge this sooner or later. Over the years, I have been most interested in the development of transportation in China. I am especially pleased to see the central government building roads for the convenience of troop movements, thereby consolidating its position. But in the end, I feel that the progress made by the people of those areas in commerce and social interaction as a result of opening up new roads is even more commendable. Dr. Schurman should study this, and he will know that various forces in China are now working hard to achieve unification."</p>
<h3>The Yuanshun Steamer Calls for Help</h3>
<p>Lost at Sea off Ningbo Yesterday</p>
<p>Shanghai Company's Telegram Calls Go Unanswered</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Yuanshun steamer of the Datongxing Steamer Company, with a gross tonnage of 1,611 tons and a net tonnage of 1,016 tons, is dedicated to carrying cargo. It used to travel between Shanghai and Yingkou. This month, on the evening of the 4th, it loaded over 1,000 tons of cargo in Yantai and sailed to Xinghua, Fujian. The cargo mainly consisted of soybean oil, sorghum, and grain, and it also carried a small number of passengers traveling to Xinghua.</p>
<h3>Accident Due to Fog</h3>
<p>After the Yuanshun steamer departed from Yantai, it reached the waters off Ningbo at 12:45 AM yesterday. The route from Yantai to Ningbo is approximately 540 nautical miles. It encountered fog along the way and was sailing in the dark of night, losing its course and causing the accident. The shipowner instructed the wireless operator to send a telegram for help, but whether it was due to striking a reef or colliding with another ship is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Sending a Telegram for Help</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Radio Station received the Yuanshun steamer's call for help at 12:45 AM yesterday. At the same time, it also received the Jiahe steamer's call for help. The Japanese Salvage Company telegraphed the Mitsui Trading Company, the Shanghai salvage agent. The company then notified the Shanghai branch of Datongxing. The Shanghai company also received a telegram from the Yingkou headquarters yesterday morning, informing them that the Yingkou radio station had received the calls for help from the Yuanshun steamer and the Jiahe steamer or the Huafeng steamer.</p>
<h3>Telegram Calls Go Unanswered</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai branch of Datongxing immediately inquired with the Shanghai General Bureau of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. At the same time, it requested the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation to send telegrams to the waters off Ningbo, calling for the Yuanshun steamer. After four calls, the Yuanshun steamer's reply was still not received last night.</p>
<h3>Jiahe is Fine</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reporter went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's radio station yesterday to inquire. They learned that the station received a telegram from the Jiahe steamer from Fuzhou yesterday afternoon, stating that it was docked in Fuzhou. This proves that the Jiahe steamer did not encounter any danger. As for the Huafeng steamer, it does not travel to Shanghai, so it was impossible to verify. They also went to the Coastal Radio Station to inquire and learned that the Shanghai station also received the ship's call for help yesterday morning, but the audio was too low to understand.</p>
<h3>Company Worries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Datongxing is very anxious about the Yuanshun steamer case. After the telegram calls went unanswered, in addition to reporting to the Yingkou headquarters, it inquired with various parties in Shanghai, hoping to obtain accurate information about the Yuanshun steamer. According to those familiar with shipping affairs, the Yuanshun steamer's unanswered telegram calls indicate that it may have encountered an unforeseen event.</p>
<h3>Xu Chengqi and Jiang Fengji are Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>After the Navy's domestically produced Jiangfeng seaplane crashed in Wenzhou on its flight to Fuzhou, the Naval Department immediately dispatched the Chutai transport ship to transport the plane back to Shanghai for repairs. According to Zeng Yijing, the head of the Aviation Department, speaking to the Riri News reporter yesterday, he recently received a telegram from Wenzhou stating that the ship set sail at 12:00 noon yesterday (the 6th), transporting the Jiangfeng aircraft and workers back to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at Gaochangmiao for unloading no later than tomorrow morning, i.e., this morning. The damaged parts of the aircraft are minimal, and it can take off after minor repairs. As for the injured instructor Xu, he is also returning to Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangji ship today. He is expected to arrive in port tomorrow afternoon, i.e., this afternoon. After arriving in Shanghai, he may be admitted to the Naval Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Releases Statistics on the Monetary Business</h3>
<p>Affected by the Economic Downturn, Business is Sluggish</p>
<p>Money Houses Mostly Adopt a Cautious Approach to Lending</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce released statistics on the monetary business, stating that since the opening of the five ports to foreign trade, Shanghai's commerce has become increasingly prosperous, and foreign trade has become increasingly developed. In order to maintain the market and assist the development of industry and commerce, the need for circulating finance must increase daily, and the turnover and exchange of silver and money must also prosper. Thus, the organization of money houses emerged as a financial regulatory mechanism. The agreement on interbank lending rates, the circulation of money house notes, and daily remittance transfers are all jointly decided by the monetary industry association. In the past, Nanshi's commerce was developed, and the business of money houses was also very developed. After the Taiping Rebellion, Nanshi suffered greatly, commerce declined, and the monetary business plummeted. Beishi, however, was located in the concessions and was not affected. To this day, the center of the monetary business has shifted from Nanshi to Beishi. The various money houses in Nanshi only follow the market trends of Beishi. The various money houses must borrow the services of the three major Chinese banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China for the collection and settlement of silver and money transactions with foreign banks, which is very inconvenient. Later, in order to safeguard the interests of the industry and facilitate the collection and settlement of silver and money, the monetary industry jointly remitted, and the Zhuang and Yuan character houses concentrated their finances and organized the Money Industry Joint Reserve in Ningbo Road, which was established on October 1, 1932. It is truly the central institution of Shanghai's finance. However, the conservative habits of the monetary industry are more serious than those of other industries. Although its organization is not as complete as that of banks and its capital is not as abundant as that of banks, due to its different nature, its credit lending and business scope far exceed those of banks. It has a long history, rich experience, simple procedures, and convenient contact. It can be accessed at any time from morning to night, which is quite suitable for the commercial habits of the Chinese people. Recently, in response to the trend of the times, it is planning to reform diligently and is also one of the three major financial pillars (foreign banks, domestic banks, and money houses). Therefore, it is still able to occupy a special and important position in the financial world and has the power to influence the finance of the interior. A total of 63 remitting houses and Yuan character houses in Nanshi and Beishi have been completely surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce. Based on their organizational situation and business overview, with the year 1932 as the standard, various statistics have been compiled and listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>The nature of fundraising and the amount of deposits and loans for the whole year are listed as follows: (Number of houses) Sole proprietorship, remitting houses 5, partnership, remitting houses 55, Yuan character houses 3, total 63, (Number of employees) remitting houses 1,823, Yuan character houses 103, total 1,926, (Capital) Sole proprietorship, remitting houses 1,780,000 yuan, partnership, remitting houses 15,457,496 yuan, Yuan character houses 450,000 yuan, total 17,687,496 yuan, (Amount of long-term deposits for the whole year) Sole proprietorship, remitting houses 4,700,000 yuan, partnership, remitting houses 32,068,246 yuan, Yuan character houses 2,700,000 yuan, total 39,468,246 yuan, (Amount of current deposits for the whole year) Sole proprietorship, remitting houses 8,550,000 yuan, partnership, remitting houses 12,073,981 yuan, Yuan character houses 2,700,000 yuan, total 122,323,981 yuan, (Amount of long-term loans for the whole year) Sole proprietorship, remitting houses 6,000,000 yuan, partnership, remitting houses 64,774,442 yuan, Yuan character houses 3,100,000 yuan, total 73,874,442 yuan, (Amount of current loans for the whole year) Sole proprietorship, remitting houses 6,200,000 yuan, partnership, remitting houses 75,889,704 yuan, Yuan character houses 2,100,000 yuan, total 84,189,704 yuan,</p>
<p>The business overview of Nanshi and Beishi is as follows: (Number of houses) Nanshi remitting houses 4, Beishi remitting houses 56, Yuan character houses 3, total 63, (Number of employees) Nanshi 107, Beishi 1,819, total 1,926, (Amount of various deposits for the whole year) Nanshi 8,344,000 yuan, Beishi 153,448,227 yuan, total 161,792,227 yuan, (Amount of various loans for the whole year) Nanshi 6,896,000 yuan, Beishi 151,168,146 yuan, total 158,064,146 yuan,</p>
<p>In total, there are 60 remitting houses and 3 Yuan character houses in the city. The remitting houses, due to their thicker capital and larger business, have joined the industry association (i.e., the Remitting General Association, also known as joining the gang), and thus have the name remitting houses. The Hen character houses, with their smaller scope and small loans and cash discounting, number 25. The Li character houses, which engage in interbank lending and buying and selling public bonds, number 12. The Zhen character houses, which engage in the collection and exchange of various types of gold and silver tickets, foreign money, number 34. It is estimated that there are 134 large and small money houses in the city. After the final settlement last year, 11 remitting houses, including Futai, added or changed their marks. 2 remitting houses, Tongtai and Dingtai, changed their signs. 2 remitting houses, Tongan and Hengxiang, and 2 Yuan character houses, Longtai and Dingda, closed down. Yifeng Zhuang has been expanded and changed to Zhengming Bank. Financial businesses should be operated in cooperation. Therefore, statistics show that partnerships are more common than sole proprietorships. Moreover, money houses bear unlimited liability, and their thick capital and strong resources allow them to adopt a more prudent business policy. However, in order to adapt to commercial customs and regulate finance, they place emphasis on credit. For example, a certain soy sauce shop owner does not have sufficient funds to use, nor can he use soy sauce as collateral to guarantee a loan from a bank. Money houses, however, can investigate whether his credit is reliable and arbitrarily grant loans to help him out of his predicament. This type of credit lending and overdraft is considered a dangerous business by the banking industry. In recent years, the international market has been sluggish, and the import and export industries have plummeted. Last year, the business was affected by the commercial downturn and suddenly felt sluggish. Most of them implemented austerity measures, and adopted a cautious approach to the loans of various businesses. The obstruction of social finance is due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the accumulation of inventory of various businesses. The need for sales stagnation, silver and money turnover is sharply reduced. Therefore, the results of the investigation are published in the newspaper for the reference of those who are concerned about the financial industry. (Xinsheng News Agency)</p>
<h3>Two Industries Discuss Methods to Deal with Unscrupulous Merchants</h3>
<p>The Glass Industry Association, due to the discovery that some unscrupulous individuals in the industry are selling inferior goods on the market, held a meeting yesterday and resolved to notify members and non-members to follow the instructions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The details are as follows: "To Whom It May Concern, the Japanese invaders have occupied the Northeast, massacring countless compatriots. Then they unleashed their troops on Shanghai, and the essence of the entire country was devastated. As a result, commerce is sluggish, and rural areas are bankrupt. We are all heartbroken and indignant, and we will never coexist with them under the same sky. We should permanently sever economic ties with them in order to save the fate of the country. However, recently, Japanese merchants have seen that Chinese merchants can be easily tempted by profits, so they have resumed their activities everywhere, and inferior goods have once again flooded the market. All of us in the industry should fulfill our national duty and resist to the end, without being moved. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already instructed the Woolen Goods Association on how to sanction the sale of provincial goods. This association has heard that there are also a few black sheep in the industry who openly sell inferior goods, so it has specially proposed the resolution of the fifth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees and sent a letter to members and non-members, urging them to be of one mind and not to sell inferior goods. It will also send personnel to secretly investigate. If there are any violators, this association will handle them in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. A copy of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's instructions on how to sanction the sale of inferior goods is enclosed for your reference and compliance."</p>
<p>The Vacuum Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association has recently learned that a large number of inferior vacuum bottles are planned to be dumped in this city. However, feeling that it is inconvenient to sell them openly, they are sacrificing themselves and using a group of unscrupulous merchants who are willing to be accomplices to promote the sales. Moreover, the fact that a few member factories have recently withdrawn from the association on the pretext makes us feel that there are suspicious clues. If we do not devise strict countermeasures, the domestic vacuum bottle industry will be greatly affected. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened a few days ago. More than ten representatives from factories such as Lixing, Zhenye, Hanchang, Zhonghua, Tongchang, Xianghua, Sanxing, and Far East attended. As a result of the discussion, in addition to notifying all members to refrain from being accomplices and refusing to use inferior raw materials, a re-registration of members will also be conducted to begin a thorough investigation. If the above-mentioned facts are found to be true and there is solid evidence, the matter will be reported to the superior authorities for the most severe sanctions, and the names of the factories and managers will be published in the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Memorial Eulogy</h3>
<p>The memorial eulogy reads, "Alas, the sea is vast, and the waves do not stop. The wind is bleak, and there is no calm branch. Sea and sky winds, holding much hatred. The spirit of gold and stone, alone cannot be ground down. When you first came into the world, [you were born at] the place of the ford of [the river of] Jin and the north. You were a talent of the south, truly born with insight. Endowed with ambition and grandeur, like Mount Tai and Mount Qiao. A bright and extraordinary child, with a singular spirit from an early age. Tracing your life, [we see] you abandoned a position of high honor. [You came from a] noble family with inherited virtues, with knowledge exceeding the grasp of five chariots. Like a bamboo shoot just sprouting, or an orchid just budding. You should be manifested in the world, to bring prosperity to your family. At a young age, you left the country, like a Kunpeng flying ten thousand miles. You began your career as a scholar, earning a reputation. You mastered foreign languages and studied poetry. You repeatedly emerged as an outstanding talent, bringing joy to your parents. Before you reached the age of twenty, you already had an outstanding reputation. You returned by raft, studying in the old capital. You painted mountains and water, purifying your mind and feelings. Your virtue increased with age, and your learning became great. You went to England and wielded a powerful pen. You protected the people, you were inspired to study law. You excelled in every examination, and your name matched reality. Your desire to help the people was as bright as the rising sun. When fortune turned in the Zhenyuan era, the Republic of China was founded. The uprising in Hubei was a righteous cause, and you responded with enthusiasm. You shouldered a heavy burden, and walked on thin ice. You shone with brilliance, dispelling the gloom. You planned in obscurity, and navigated the difficult steps of the nation. The new government was just beginning, and neighbors were doubtful. You declared heroic texts, as if breaking through the heavy fog. Your righteousness shook the Yellow Bell, and the four barbarians submitted. The foundation of the country was strengthened, whose merit was it? You were humble and unassuming, like a wild goose flying freely. When the plot to restore the monarchy arose, the wise were obscured and blocked. Your actions and choices showed integrity and a pure spirit. Heaven was not tired of chaos, and another restoration was brewing. You resigned and returned south, a steadfast stone. You protected the law in the southwest, opening up a new frontier. You were sent as an envoy to Paris, negotiating for peace. A famous father and son, repeatedly led the foreign office. You were diligent and vigilant, like the humble and auspicious six lines of the I Ching. You fought in debate, interspersing it with humor. You supported Zhang Jian's high reputation, with magnanimity and tolerance. You were loyal and benevolent, and you carried on the virtues of your ancestors. You assisted the capital, with the heart of a skilled craftsman. The [customs] case had been pending for a long time, and you broke it down with the right [tool]. You struggled with the law, weighing the pros and cons. You served within America, and attended The Hague. With reason and strength, your thoughts returned. Your words and speech were a model, a brilliant display of words. An easy going manner, accompanied by decisiveness. Deep and cultivated spirit. Essence acting as courage, independent tariffs. Treaties were meticulous, removing [foreign] concessions. The efforts were followed by [an effort to] to abandon the foreign taxes. What you have achieved is remarkable. To resolve internal strife, your public spirit was especially noble. You negotiated divisions, speaking and laughing at banquets. You did not dwell on your achievements. You made retirement easy. Far reaching aspirations, untroubled departure. Abandoning rank and riches, seeking poetry and the sea. Fragrant orchids and artemisia, the adornment of the gentleman. Then to the south, determined to open up Hainan. Looking forward to the Five-Five Year Plan, to develop this long-held aspiration. To develop this malarial island, and elevate it to the state of Yao. Who could have predicted such a fate? All of your great talents, and your noble friendship. Your past achievements and honors. You were cautious and tried to find ways to avoid issues, you disciplined yourself and did what was right, finally ending in a humble position, how could you die. The stars have suddenly fallen. coughs and not far [from death], You will ride cranes! [China's] Long Wall suddenly falls. You cannot be an example to the barbarians any more. The mountains and rivers stretch, who will succeed you? Alas. [Like] a whale in a cart of sea, for a long time the country lost a pillar [or a symbol of stability]. Like ants on [the walls of] the South Suburb, or mixing sparrows with tea. This man has ceased to be; the sleeping lion is hard to awaken. Literature has fallen, a waste of time to rest. alas. Flowers are easily faded, bubbles are difficult to make round. Where to cultivate character, when to hold arms? A moment in the universe, how can we prove fate? Clean sacrifices are given, looking to heaven and earth. alas."</p>

Your heroic demeanor and strong character were unique in your generation. You were able to overcome difficulties and had loyal integrity. How can we not mourn the loss of such a shining star? In the past, you, sir, had the experience and wisdom of an elder statesman. You protected the law and aided the times, providing advice and setting rules. You were a pillar of the nation, a model for all countries. You possessed those virtues. You maintained your reputation and had loyal integrity. You were the only voice at the Washington conference. You spoke with loyalty and fought against difficulties. You traversed a path full of thorns, and the surrounding nations praised you. You will be a hero for generations to come. While in Guangzhou, you diligently sought to govern and pacify the people. You cultivated loyalty and integrity, and you were steadfast. Your response to the moment was decisive, and the chaos was quickly suppressed. You traveled to foreign lands again, forgetting your own labor for the sake of the nation. You defended against insults, and your tongue was exhausted. Your mastery of public law was profound, and your righteousness was unique. You used the words of Zi Chan [a statesman from the Spring and Autumn Period] to solidify relations. Our nation is newly founded in every way. Grand plans and great laws all await to be adorned. We should all work together to pave a smooth road. Alas, when we heard this, our hearts were shattered. Alas, the vastness and turbulence of the Pearl River.

You supported the party and the nation, and you strengthened the foundation of our country. You negotiated and fought in debates. You fought for national rights, and the central government relied heavily on you. You attended the League of Nations, and you had a keen insight. You were eloquent and supported the weak. You repeatedly served as an envoy, promoting culture. The world competed to spread your message. Your writing made the prices increase, and the construction of Hainan began. You planned the mountains and forests, and you admired the Sichuan landscape. You were concerned about the people's livelihood, and you had grand plans. Before your great schemes could be implemented, how could Heaven have taken you away so quickly? Distant lands were moved, and all the seas were shocked. The pillars were broken, and the masses lost their model. Your merits will be engraved in bronze vessels, and your name will be recorded in the history books. National ceremonies will praise you, and your legacy will be passed down for thousands of years. The Pearl River is lush, and the Guangdong Sea is boundless. Your spirit seems to be connected to us, may you come and enjoy this."</p>

<h3>Mr. Mei Lehe Departed Shanghai Yesterday to Return to England</h3>

<h3>Seamen's Insurance Launched</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Siming Insurance Company has successively launched various types of insurance, including fire, marine, and automobile, earning a notable reputation and enthusiastic support from policyholders. Recently, it has introduced a special "Seamen's Insurance" program specifically for workers serving on ships of all sizes, wharves, and related maritime industries. The method is annual, not extending to five or ten years. The insured amount is limited to between one hundred and one thousand yuan, with extremely low premiums that can be paid in installments, comprehensively considering the living conditions and capabilities of seamen. The simplicity of the procedures makes it easy for ordinary seamen to understand. Former section chief of the China Merchants Bureau, Hong Yanbin, has been specially appointed as manager, with the office located at No. 3 Xiang'an Lane, Gongguan Road. Insurance coverage began on April 1st, and it has been well-received by various shipping companies and seamen's organizations. Within a few months, the number of policyholders has reached over a thousand.</p>
<h3>Master Mariners' Association Again Requests the Ministry of Communications to Refuse to Issue Certificates to Japanese Seafarers</h3>
<p>Reportedly, Shipping Companies Hiring Japanese Seafarers</p>
<p>Indeed Issue Certificates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Master Mariners' Association previously reported that Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahe had verbally agreed to the request of the Japanese Consul in Nanjing to issue seafarer service certificates to Japanese seafarers who had not passed the Chinese examination and certification, totaling seventy to eighty people. This not only hinders the recovery of navigation rights but also contradicts the central government's past declarations promoting domestic shipping and rewarding Chinese shipping talents. They had petitioned Minister Zhu to promptly stop this and to sternly reject the Japanese request in order to protect navigation rights. Subsequently, they received a ministerial response stating that the claim that service certificates had been issued to Japanese seafarers who had not passed the examination and certification was purely a rumor and should not be taken seriously. The association considered this matter to be of great importance, not to be dismissed with empty words, directly affecting all seafarers and indirectly posing a significant threat to life and property. In recent years, accidents involving Japanese ships on Chinese waters have been frequently observed. The impact on the livelihoods of Chinese seafarers is not insignificant. Therefore, they launched an investigation and have now obtained some clues. Thus, they have submitted another petition to the Ministry of Communications, sent via express mail to Beijing, stating that the association has repeatedly investigated and learned from people close to shipping companies hiring Japanese seafarers that the Ministry has granted the Japanese request to issue certificates to Japanese seafarers who have not passed the examination and certification. The report from shipping companies hiring Japanese seafarers also confirms this, indicating that the Ministry's agreement to the Japanese request is not groundless. As this matter concerns the vital interests of shipping merchants and seafarers, it should be strictly rejected and the issuance of certificates should be stopped. This would be a great fortune for the shipping industry. They also requested instructions to be followed. This petition has just been submitted to the Ministry and has not yet received a reply in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Li Pingheng and Others, Representatives to the International Labour Conference, Scheduled to Sail on the 10th</h3>
<p>The representatives of the Chinese delegation to the upcoming International Labour Conference, representing the government, labour, and employers, have been selected. The government representative is Li Pingheng, Director of the Labour Department of the Ministry of Industry, who arrived in Shanghai a few days ago to meet with the other representatives. They are scheduled to depart for Geneva on the 10th aboard the Italian mail ship "Contessa Rosso". In addition to the two secretaries, Xie Dongfa and Ruan Hongyi, who are already working at the Chinese Embassy in France, the others, such as Wang Zhisheng, An Futing, Bao Huaguo, and Cheng Haifeng, are also preparing to travel on the same day. Regarding China's proposals for this conference, although the issue of factory inspection rights is intended to be raised for discussion, it is not fixed. Although this case is important, the resolutions made by the Labour Conference do not have the immediate effect of a binding convention. Implementation still depends on the individual countries. Therefore, China will only submit a report to the conference to draw the attention of the representatives of various countries. It is not yet appropriate to announce other proposals in advance.</p>

<h3>Directors Huang of Two Railways Admonish Employees</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Huang Boqiao, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, issued a circular yesterday admonishing employees of all departments of the two railways, stating: "According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for material construction in his National Reconstruction Program, the development of transportation is of primary importance, with particular emphasis on railway construction. In January of this year, the Fourth Plenary Session declared that unification and construction are both absolutely necessary, and clarified that anything hindering unification and construction is hindering the great plan for national survival. In July of last year and February of this year, President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission jointly issued urgent telegrams emphasizing that there is nothing more urgent than production and construction. On February 19th, President Wang reported at the weekly memorial service of the Executive Yuan that railway construction was one of the key areas of recent construction work. Indeed, railway construction can both promote political unification and increase national production, making it the foundation of construction. The Directors of this Administration believe that for those engaged in railway construction, extending new lines is important, but improving existing lines cannot be ignored. The poor management of state-owned railways in our country has long been criticized by the people, leading to a lack of recognition of the importance of railways. If existing lines can be improved so that everyone can enjoy their convenience, then promoting new lines at the same time will be more welcomed by the people and easier to gain their support. Therefore, since taking office, the Directors of this Administration, following the instructions of the Ministry of Railways, have made improvement an urgent task. Last year, we first implemented the commercialization of state-owned railways and adopted a proactive approach to attracting business. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of our colleagues, we have seen some success. Recently, we also revised the organizational structure of the traffic section to clarify the responsibilities of traffic personnel, which will further promote business. At the same time, we are reorganizing the Wusong Locomotive Factory to increase the efficiency of repairing and manufacturing locomotives and rolling stock to meet the needs of expanding business. As for the organizational structures of various departments, the engineering and accounting departments have also completed revisions and will be implemented soon. All of these are aimed at improving work efficiency. We have only slightly redistributed existing employees to ensure that personnel are properly assigned. Anyone who can abide by laws and regulations, work diligently, and achieve significant results will be strongly supported. On the other hand, we will also do our best to improve the welfare of our colleagues so that their physical and mental well-being and economic burden can be effectively addressed. All of us, my colleagues, must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, adhere to the Party and state's policies, and continue to work hard within the scope of our service to the railways to contribute to the nation's production and construction. The Directors of this Administration are willing to work together with our colleagues. If, unfortunately, anyone is ignorant of the nation's urgency and the importance of the railways, or takes actions that exceed the bounds of propriety and hinder the progress of the railways, they will be obstructing the nation's construction, betraying Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and violating the central government's policies. They will be considered undesirable elements in the railways and criminals against the Party and the state, and the Directors of this Administration will have no choice but to enforce the law. This is a circular to all departments and offices, which must be followed immediately, and all subordinates must be instructed to comply with it. This order is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association Prepares to Participate in the Hunan National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>Expanding the Site and Continuing to Collect Products</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Touring Group, under the leadership of the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, participated in the Wuhan National Products Exhibition to serve national products factories and promote sales in central China. Their efforts were successful, and the exhibition has now closed and they have returned to Shanghai. Chairman He Yunqiao of Hunan Province, who is enthusiastic about the national products movement, is holding a Hunan Provincial National Products Mobile Exhibition in the provincial capital. He has ordered the Department of Construction and the Changsha Chamber of Commerce to be responsible for the preparations, tentatively scheduled to open on the 20th of this month, and has sent a telegram inviting participation. The association has publicly appointed Chen Jusheng and Xu Qiaoqi, members of the Cooperation Section and the General Secretary, respectively, to negotiate and plan the preparations. Yesterday, they received a telegram from the two representatives stating that the seven-story building of the National Products Exhibition Hall in the bustling center has been designated as the venue, expanding the site to 140 rooms, and all work is actively underway. The Standing Committee has decided that the Hunan Exhibition will open on the 25th of this month. Since the site has been expanded, the collection of participants should continue to achieve widespread publicity for the products of factory members. Lin Guyun, Xu Yunhui, and Dong Boying of the Cooperation Section will work with Standing Committee members Chen Zhuting, Chen Binghui, Xu Ruo, and Fang Jiange to revise the list of factory categories, the number of products, and daily necessities. All kinds of seasonal products and well-known national products factories are especially welcome to participate. In addition to individual committee members soliciting participants, the secretariat will notify all factory members to register before the 10th of this month. The methods for transporting products to Hunan have also been specified and notified to the registered factories. It is also learned that the association has been entrusted by the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing National Exhibition of the Ministry of Railways to collect participants from various factories. Once the Hunan Exhibition closes and the representatives return to Shanghai, they will lead the delegation to the Beijing Exhibition.</p>

<h3>Shanghai North Rice Carriers Strike to Protest the Cancellation of Wine Fees</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Orders the Rice Industry to Advise</p>
<p>Rice merchants in Shanghai North have announced the cancellation of the wine fee for rice carriers (i.e., the wine fee for carrying rice), leading to a strike. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>History of Wine Fee</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, for every shi of rice, the rice carriers charge 24 cash. The same rate applies in both the northern and southern parts of the city. This practice has been in place for a long time. In 1912, the rice merchants paid the rice carriers 10 cash per shi of rice as a wine fee, the purpose of which was to help the rice carriers slightly in the process of carrying rice. In 1929, it was changed to 50 cash. In 1930, it was changed to 2 cents. When the price of rice rose to 25 yuan per shi, the difference between the weight and the amount charged became significant, so the rice merchants increased it to 2 jiao per shi. After the rice price crisis subsided, it remained at 2 cents. During the January 28th Incident, it changed to 5 cents. Since last year, it has been 3 cents.</p>
<h3>Planned Abolition</h3>
<p>Although rice carriers are nominally hired workers of the rice shops, the rice shops only provide meals and do not pay wages. Their income comes from the fixed 24 cash per shi, the wine fee, and commissions from the sale of rice (i.e., what is commonly called brokerage). Recently, due to the decline in rice prices, the rice merchants announced that they would cancel the wine fee from April 1st, which was opposed by the rice carriers. They went on strike on the 5th. Some rice merchants wanted to return to their hometowns, so they paid the fee to hire rice carriers. Some rice carriers waited for the fee to be paid before working. The bean and rice industry and the rice carriers' union have petitioned the Party and government agencies to request negotiations.</p>
<h3>Rice Carriers Strike</h3>
<p>Due to the dispute between the rice merchants and the rice carriers over the wine fee, some rice merchants announced that they would refuse to hire rice carriers, and the rice carriers went on strike. The Shanghai North Rice Sales Association, believing that this matter concerns the people's livelihood and fearing that a dispute over a small issue would affect social stability, has tried to mediate between the two parties, offering 2 cents per shi, but this was ineffective. Yesterday, rice carriers from Suzhou, Changshu, Jiangyin, Anhui, Yixing, and Jiangbei resumed work, but only a few from Wuxi did so. Yesterday, Fan Xisheng and Jin Guobiao, two rice merchants from Wuxi, had a dispute with the rice carriers at the wharf for preventing the transport of rice, but fortunately, no incident occurred.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Handling</h3>
<p>Fearing that the situation would escalate, the Municipal Party Department sent Secretary-General Jiang Huaisu, together with Fan Guoren from the Civil Affairs Section and Zhou Minggang from the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to investigate the truth yesterday afternoon. According to Jiang Huaisu of the Municipal Party Department, the Party Department believes that this matter is a dispute over a small issue, so it has ordered the rice industry to advise both parties in the hope of resolving it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Contractors Jointly Petition the Municipal Council for Arrangement</h3>
<p>Claiming to Bear Many Obligations and Not Just Profit Without Labour</p>
<p>Since the Public Concession's Municipal Council planned to reform the rickshaw industry in the special zone, deciding to revoke 2,000 licenses on July 1st and solicit new contractors, it has been repeatedly opposed by rickshaw owners and contractors. Zheng Guisheng, Zhu Deyao, Zhang Baofa, Huang Dengru, Shan Guideng, Qiao Wensheng, Xu Hongru, Yu Jiashun, Bian Qiren, Dai Yuean, and more than 1,500 other rickshaw contractors in the special zone jointly petitioned Municipal Council Director-General Chung Sze yesterday to withdraw the order to abolish rickshaw contractors in order to maintain their livelihoods. The original petition is excerpted as follows: "For the matter of jointly petitioning for the arrangement of positions to maintain the livelihoods of the people, we, Guisheng, etc., read in the newspaper yesterday that the Municipal Council's Board of Directors had adopted the proposal that the rickshaw rental should be 8 jiao per day and stipulated in the license regulations that this amount should not be exceeded, and that rickshaw pullers should also be licensed. We were shocked to hear this. We believe that the rickshaw owners bear a heavy responsibility in obtaining the rickshaw rental, such as providing dormitories, making equipment, lending money to attract rickshaw pullers, providing expenses to repay rent arrears, compensating for lost vehicles, and damaged parts. All kinds of obligations, all those in the rickshaw business know this, and it is not just profit without labour. The rickshaw pullers are also happy to take on the transfers, only requiring that there be a rickshaw to pull, not caring about the amount of the rickshaw rental. We previously heard that the Rickshaw Committee had proposed a rickshaw rental of 8 jiao. We have investigated and found that the market has its ups and downs, and prices also fluctuate. Therefore, the Council should only have supervisory power and not have the power to determine the amount. In the future, the new regulations should not include it. If there is no one responsible in this way, there will be no system. Guisheng, etc., have already jointly declared that the responsibilities are at stake. On March 14th, we submitted a petition requesting the Council to consider the livelihood issues of rickshaw contractors and to determine a rickshaw rental that is in line with the situation. We hope that you will understand. However, the original proposal is still being adopted without any increase. Rickshaw pullers must also be licensed to pull rickshaws, and there are restrictions. We do not know that rickshaw pullers may come and go to the countryside. In the future, we are afraid that there will be rickshaws without anyone to pull them. Then, the contractors will not be able to make a profit from this. They would not be willing to bear this heavy responsibility, which is tantamount to eliminating the position of rickshaw contractors and abruptly cutting off the livelihood of rickshaw contractors. It goes without saying that we must know that the rise and fall of all industries are not permanent. Looking at the reasons for the rise and fall, they are all caused by the pursuit of extreme circumstances. Only our rickshaw industry is currently in a period of prosperous operation. Although rickshaw pullers are said to be laborers, they support themselves and make a living. Compared with other laborers, they have a special situation. Therefore, there are tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers in this city, and there has never been a labor dispute. This is because the contractors are transferring between the rickshaw owners and the rickshaw pullers. We ask ourselves if we have made some contributions. Now, what crime have the rickshaw contractors committed that they should be eliminated? Observing the administrative authorities, they do not consider the large number of unemployed people in this city, and they will abruptly make rickshaw contractors, who have a safe livelihood, unemployed. They beautify it by calling it relief, which is not reasonable or reasonable. It is not seeking safety, but in fact, it is causing disputes. After thinking about it, we secretly believe that the Council has considered everything carefully and will never let the 1,500 or so rickshaw contractors suddenly cut off their livelihoods. We believe that there must be good arrangements to maintain the lives of the people. However, there is no clear expression, so we cannot help but be vigilant. Moreover, the most difficult thing to solve is that most of the contractors have a limited-year contract with the rickshaw owners. The current rickshaw rental cannot be terminated in the middle of the contract, which interferes with the law. How can the compensation within the term of the contract be obtained? In addition to continuously petitioning, which has not been approved, we should jointly continue to petition the Council to review and approve the process of how to arrange the positions of rickshaw contractors in detail in order to comfort the public's expectations, and also request the Council to indicate the legal basis for the dissolution of the contract, which we hope to be grateful for."</p>

<h3>This City's Journalists' Association Declares It Has Absolutely Not Participated in the Eastern Tour Group</h3>
<p>A draft was to be written immediately for publication in the newspapers, declaring:</p>
<p>Rejecting the Participation of the Puppet State in the Far East Games</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Association, concerning the matter of some people in the city's tabloid press organizing a "Chinese Journalists' Eastern Tour Group" to participate in the Nagasaki International Industrial and Tourism Exposition, which concerns the credibility of the journalism field and may cause confusion, held a temporary executive committee meeting at its premises yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. Those present included Sun Daosheng, Jin Xiongbai, Yu Kongwo, Zhao Junhao, Jiang Zongyi, Hang Shijun, Ma Chonggan, Li Zutang, Jiang Jianhou, Qu Shaoqi, Gu Zhizhong (represented by Fang Juying), Tang Shichang (represented by Qu Shaoqi), Xu Chihen, and Shen Qiuyan. Two motions were resolved: (1) Regarding the tabloid press organizing the Eastern Tour Group, it was resolved to publish a statement in the newspapers declaring that members of the association had absolutely not participated in this group. The statement was drafted and passed on the spot and sent to various newspapers for publication. The text read: "Recently, it has been heard that some are using the name of Shanghai's journalism circles and are receiving an invitation from the Shanghai Japanese Mainichi Shimbun to go to Nagasaki to participate in the [International Industrial and Tourism Exposition]. Upon investigation, no members of this association have participated in this invitation. We hereby solemnly declare this and hope the various sectors will take note. (Furthermore, the Chinese Iron-Blood National Salvation Corps stated, [We have received your letter. Upon investigation, absolutely no unfilial elements of this kind are participating among the members of this association. We hereby reply.])." (2) Regarding the Manila Vanguard Daily's telegram reporting that overseas Chinese in Manila unanimously reject the participation of the puppet state in the Far East Games, requesting widespread publicity, it was resolved to copy the original telegram and send it to the National Sports Association, and to telegraph back to the newspaper, offering support, and to inform all members to make a concerted effort to publicize it. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Attached is a letter from the Mainichi Shimbun, as follows: "Dear Sirs, We have read an article in the local news section of your esteemed newspaper on the 7th of this month, regarding a warning from the Chinese Iron-Blood National Salvation Corps concerning the Nagasaki Eastern Tour Group. Upon investigation, the Nagasaki Eastern Tour Group was initiated with our people as the target, and it is the personal initiative of our president, unrelated to our government offices. The article in your esteemed newspaper is completely fabricated and greatly harms the reputation of our government offices and our president, and it also obstructs the relationship between China and Japan. We have long admired your esteemed newspaper as a leader in the journalism field. Once published, it is most likely to cause misunderstandings among the general public. We are sending this special letter to request that your esteemed newspaper make a sincere correction in the local news section of tomorrow's newspaper, so as to avoid false rumors. Sincerely, Sakuji Fukamachi, President of the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, April 7th."</p>
<h3>Tenants of Baohua Lane Oppose Demolition of Houses</h3>
<p>Police Prevent Landlord from Building a Fence</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: The owner of Baohua Lane on Xinjihama Road in the Public Concession, Dehe Foreign Firm, issued a notice on December 31st of last year, ordering all tenants to vacate their houses before March 31st of this year in order to rebuild. The residents of the lane, believing that the houses are still intact, and in light of the current economic downturn and difficult market conditions, where all sectors are urgently seeking to reduce rents, how could they use the pretext of rebuilding to evict the residents? They were forced to send representatives to repeatedly request the firm to consider the people's difficulties and postpone the rebuilding. Until recently, the residents of the lane requested the First Special District Citizens' United Association to uphold justice. The association sent Zhang Xianfang and Zheng Dongshan to mediate with the firm. Only now has a slight change occurred, and they have agreed to postpone the rebuilding for several months. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday, the firm went back on its word and sent several workers on six trucks to nail bamboo fences in the lane. Upon hearing the news, all the women and children of the lane, more than 300 people, went out to block them. The situation became very tense for a while. Then, the patrol police arrived and, failing to dissuade them, took them all to the police station. Hundreds of men and women from the lane also flocked to the police station. The police chief, seeing that there were many people and voices were mixed, ordered them to elect representatives for questioning. The crowd immediately elected Yu Shilong, Yu Xiaolin, Wei Hongqing, and Wang Fangting at the entrance of the police station to meet with the police chief. After questioning by the police chief, he kindly advised them to order the crowd to disperse and promised to inform Dehe Foreign Firm to stop building the bamboo fence and wait for a peaceful resolution between the host and guests to maintain local stability. Therefore, they immediately left and led all the tenants to Baohua Lane to hold an emergency meeting. A representative of the Municipal Council, Chen Jiufeng, attended. Yu Shilong was elected as chairman. After reporting on the process of petitioning the police station, it was resolved that the rebuilding period for the lane would be after three years. If the landlord puts pressure on them, they are willing to fight to the death. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Government Employees Who Commit Crimes Should Be Severely Punished with Increased Severity</h3>
<p>Gao Maozhen's Theft Crime Was Only Punished with a Fine</p>
<p>The Prosecutor Has Filed an Appeal</p>
<p>Guo Maozhen, a supervisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was accused of stealing several hundred yuan in cash and gold jewelry while searching the home of Li Ming, owner of the Gaochang Temple Jiangbian Road No. 678 small food shop, for gambling activities. Li Ming filed a complaint with the court, and the police chief of the Second District testified in court. Therefore, Gao was detained by the Prosecutor's Office. He was once released on bail by the Criminal Court, but because he avoided appearing in court, the guarantor was ordered to pay the bail money and hand Gao over to the court. The presiding judge, Liu Enrong, sentenced Li Ming to one year in prison and a fine of 200 yuan for operating a gambling den, while Gao's theft crime was punished with a fine of 660 yuan. After the verdict, Prosecutor Xie Lian argued that Gao was a government employee and should be severely punished with increased severity for committing a crime. The punishment of a fine would allow him to pay it off and go free. In terms of deterrence, there would be no substantial restriction on him, which would affect his repentance. To ensure equal treatment for officials and civilians, Prosecutor Xie detained Gao and filed an appeal, requesting the higher court to impose a suitable sentence according to the law to demonstrate fairness. Therefore, yesterday, the police were dispatched to escort Gao to the Suzhou Higher Court for trial. However, the original guarantor, Qiu Jinyun, was suddenly summoned to court again yesterday afternoon to inquire about the progress of the case during the litigation.</p>
<h3>Li Shuyun, Released on Bail for Medical Treatment, Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to Mental Deterioration, She Does Not Wish to See Guests</p>
<p>Li Wenhui Denies Reconciliation</p>
<p>Because Liu Zhuomin, the director of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, refused to cooperate, involving Li Shuyun, the wife of Gu Renfa, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, and her daughter, and causing a complex case of bigamy and fraud that caused a national uproar, Gu resigned and left the province due to criticism from all sides. Although the Wuxi District Court summoned them for questioning, Gu did not appear. Li Shuyun and her daughter were released on bail by Li Wenhui and came to Shanghai the night before last for medical treatment. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Released on Bail for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Daily News visited Li Wenhui yesterday morning to inquire about the whereabouts of Li Shuyun and her daughter after they arrived in Shanghai. According to Li, Shuyun suffered too much stimulation in prison, and her worries accumulated, leading to a severe outbreak of liver and stomach diseases, and her physical and mental state was deteriorating. Therefore, she has been admitted to a hospital for treatment. However, the name of the hospital is being kept secret temporarily because Shuyun does not wish to meet with relatives and friends, so that she can rest peacefully.</p>
<h3>Reconciliation Is Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>According to Li, the rumor that Shuyun came to Shanghai to reconcile is not true. However, the origin of the rumor may be Gu's intention. The bigamy case and the Liu Zhuomin case are completely separate matters and should not be discussed together. Shuyun hopes that the truth of the case can be revealed and that her grievances can be redressed. However, the key to reconciliation lies with Gu and not with Shuyun. Therefore, Shuyun will still go to Wuxi when her health improves.</p>
<h3>After the Pitou Workers' Strike, More Than 200,000 Pieces of Japanese Cloth are Shipped to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Japanese Western Cloths Are Selling Well in North China</p>
<p>The First Batch is Shipped by the "Ichijin Maru"</p>
<p>The pitou (piece goods) lao sifu (foremen) of the Tianjin gang's customs brokerage firms in this city went on strike because the keke (customers) did not pay the cartage fee. The customs brokerage firms also stopped reporting and shipping pitou due to the rift caused by the strike. As a result, Chinese cloth could not be shipped to North China, and Japanese western cloth seized a good opportunity to be shipped in large quantities. The first batch, worth more than 200,000 yuan, has already been shipped. A reporter from this newspaper spoke with people in the industry yesterday and learned the following details of the incident and the current situation.</p>
<p>The Customs Brokerage Firms' Last Haul</p>
<p>Tianjin is a port where many pitou are shipped from Shanghai every year. Before 1920, the keke all had the customs brokerage firms handle it for them. For each piece of western cloth, after deducting the water freight and miscellaneous expenses, the customs brokerage firm could make a profit of two yuan and several jiao. In recent years, the keke have mostly purchased directly from textile factories or foreign firms, and the customs brokerage firms only handle the reporting and shipping of a portion of it. After the January 28th Incident, the market conditions deteriorated. The Japanese customs brokerage firms in Shanghai were the first to cut prices and abolish the lao sifu cartage fee of 2.8 jiao per piece, which was paid separately by the keke, and only charged the keke 2.95 yuan per piece for freight. The Chinese customs brokerage firms had to reduce their prices accordingly because of their location. Each piece of western cloth (generally called pitou) cost 2.52 yuan for water freight paid to the shipping company, 7 fen for baili, 2.4 jiao for dock cartage, and about 3 or 4 fen for other miscellaneous expenses. The customs brokerage firm nets less than 1 jiao per ocean. If there is any damage or shortage, they are responsible for compensation. Therefore, the customs brokerage firms' shipping of Tianjin pitou has reached a point where it is losing money.</p>
<h3>The Difficulty in Resolving the Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Each customs brokerage firm has four or fewer lao sifu who load pitou. Historically, in addition to the freight, the keke paid the lao sifu another 2.8 jiao for each piece of Tianjin pitou they loaded. The customs brokerage firms did not ask about this. This year, since the Japanese first proposed the all-inclusive freight price of 2.95 yuan, the keke have also announced the cancellation of this 2.8 jiao subsidy. The lao sifu demanded it from the customs brokerage firms, but the customs brokerage firms earned less than 1 jiao. How could they agree? This led to the strike. This incident has been going on for many days. The Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau have also mediated many times. The customs brokerage firms believe that this cartage fee must result in losses, and they cannot agree to it under any circumstances. They would rather appropriately increase the wages of the pitou lao sifu, but they cannot pay the cartage fee. The workers insist on getting the cartage fee, and they do not care about the wage increase. Therefore, the strike is difficult to resolve.</p>
<h3>The Customs Brokerage Firms Have Also Stopped Shipping</h3>
<p>Yufengsheng, which has always shipped the most Tianjin western cloth, has decided to give up the business of reporting and shipping pitou and switch to reporting and shipping miscellaneous goods since the strike occurred. Fuji Customs Brokerage Firm, which has heard various unfavorable rumors after the strike, has temporarily suspended its business. It does not report or ship Tianjin pitou in general, and it has also temporarily stopped reporting other miscellaneous goods. It would rather temporarily lay off its employees than continue to make a meager profit. Recently, since the new customs regulations were announced, all keke can freely report and ship goods after paying a deposit, which has greatly impacted the business of the customs brokerage industry. Once an accident occurs, they all adopt a passive attitude.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cloth Suddenly Improves</h3>
<p>According to people in the customs brokerage industry, at least 100,000 pieces of pitou western cloth worth 20 million yuan are shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin every year. In recent years, after the boycott of inferior goods, domestic cloth has occupied a considerable share of the market in North China. The current strike has made it impossible to report and ship domestic cloth. The Tianjin gang, due to market demand, cannot immediately stop doing business, and Japanese cloth has seized this good opportunity to be shipped to Tianjin. The Japanese textile factories in this city are using Japanese ships, and Japanese customs brokerage firms are reporting and shipping on their behalf. Large quantities have already been shipped. The first batch of Japanese cloth after the strike was the 1,600 pieces of the "Ichijin Maru" to Tianjin, which were reported and shipped by Hirata Japanese Customs Brokerage Firm, worth more than 200,000 yuan. There are also large quantities of Japanese cloth to be shipped to Tianjin on the "Changsha Maru" and other Japanese ships.</p>
<h3>Domestic Cloth is Obstructed</h3>
<p>According to people in the industry, this strike not only creates opportunities for Japanese goods, but also greatly impacts the sales of domestic cloth from various factories in North China. The workers used by the Japanese customs brokerage firms to report and ship Japanese pitou are also Chinese workers who specialize in loading Japanese goods. If these workers also join the strike, the Japanese are preparing to hire Japanese or Russian workers to replace them, so as not to interrupt transportation. China will be subject to the double pressure of strikes and suspension of transportation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shiliang, Who Trafficked Red Pills, Is Convicted</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two and a Half Years and Fined 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhang Shiliang, a local, specializes in trafficking red pill drugs and secretly set up a red pill manufacturing facility on the upper floor of the Shenfeng Fruit Store at 473 Henan Road. Recently, Lu Liankui, the Chinese superintendent of the Narcotics Division of the General Inspectorate, learned of this and dispatched Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui, Song Bingzheng, Tanmu Zhang Yunhong, and Bao Detective Xu Guirong to wait at the intersection of Henan Road and Tianjin Road at 12:30 PM on the 27th of last month. He was apprehended and more than 30 bags of red pills weighing a total of 186 liang were seized. He was immediately taken back to the police station. Under interrogation, he confessed to the location of the manufacturing facility. A search was conducted at the address, and another five to six thousand liang of red pills and pill blocks, as well as raw materials and machinery, were found. On the morning of the 28th, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District for trial. However, because the principal offender was at large and still being pursued, the police lawyer requested that the trial be postponed. Yesterday was the date for the continuation of the trial. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui presided over the trial in Criminal Court One. First, the police lawyer presented the case, questioning the defendant. According to the confession, he only worked as a tea servant in the drug facility for eight or nine days and did not know much about the details. As for the principal offenders, he knew that Tang Gengsheng, Fang Shaohua, Wang Agen, and Yao were partners. All matters related to the red pill ingredients were handled by Miao Hongchang. On the 27th, Miao only instructed him to send the red pills to the entrance of Caitongde on Tianjin Road. He did not know who to hand them over to. Miao himself was also present at the time. After the police lawyer presented his opinion, Judge Liu immediately declared the end of the debate and sentenced Zhang Shiliang to two years and six months in prison and a fine of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Launch of Shanghai-Qingpu New Village Promoters Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Qingpu Road on the western outskirts of Shanghai (Hongqiao Road and Shanghai-Qingpu Road) will be open to traffic next month. Yesterday, a group of returned overseas Chinese, including Cao Zijue, invited comrades to launch the Shanghai-Qingpu New Village because of the high rents and polluted air in the concessions. They plan to purchase 50 mu of land along the Shanghai-Qingpu Road riverbank and build 50 houses. Each house will have a small open space in the back, and schools, parks, and markets will be built next to the village. The promoters association was launched yesterday. It is said that once the plan is finalized, public buses will be added to run directly from Shanghai-Qingpu Road to the Bund, which will take about 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>A 77-Year-Old Man Fell and Died in Front of His Ancestral Grave While Sweeping the Tomb</h3>
<p>Wang Shengbao, a 77-year-old boatman from the Yunyunbang in Wusong, had an eldest son, Baogen, and his wife, Zhao; and a second son, Baobao, and his wife, Xie. Wang Shengbao moved his family's houseboat to Wangjia Wharf in southern Shanghai to make it easier for his two sons to return home, as they were both sailors on the Longda and Hongda ships of the Shanghai Datong Shipping Company. However, Wang's ancestral grave was located in front of the Huoshaomiao Temple near the Hujiazhuang in western Song. The day before yesterday was Qingming, and Wang Shengbao, as his sons, daughters-in-law, and others were all busy and did not have time to sweep the tombs, took his 11-year-old grandson, named Maogou, alone to Wusong, hired a shanban boat to go to Hujiazhuang to sweep the tomb. After the offerings were completed, as the old man was about to step off the sampan, he accidentally fell on the field embankment. Unexpectedly, this fall led to his death. When the sampan rower caught a glimpse, he rushed forward to check and saw the old man lying stiff and unresponsive. Upon closer inspection, he had stopped breathing and died. Therefore, he immediately returned to Song and rushed to Shanghai to report to his sons Baogen and Baobao and their entire families. Yesterday, they arrived in Song to prepare a coffin and collect the body. It is said that the old man was usually strong and healthy, with no illnesses, but he was stubborn, so the boatmen all called him a "foreigner."</p>
<h3>Going Abroad Without a Passport</h3>
<p>Ship Sailors Catch "Yellowfish"</p>
<p>Seven People Were Found on a Ship to Japan</p>
<p>Leaving the country to go abroad requires government approval and the issuance of a passport before purchasing a ticket and boarding a ship. This is the proper procedure. However, recently, there have been some unscrupulous elements who have taken advantage of the difficulty in obtaining a passport and the high cost of ship tickets to secretly set up so-called "catch (pronounced kua in the Ningbo dialect) yellowfish" organizations. They collude with sailors or waiters on various ships to solicit passengers who do not qualify for a passport or cannot afford a ticket. They charge a certain package fee (cheaper than the ship ticket) and hide these people in the coal bunkers of the ship. They do not come out during the journey, and food is secretly provided. Upon arrival in a foreign country, they pretend to be sailors on the ship and secretly go ashore. Generally, each ship takes about ten people on each voyage, and the government and the shipping company are unaware. It is said that this secret organization is located in the Hongkou area and makes a good profit. Recently, seven people from Wenzhou, including Ye Qicheng (29 years old), Zhang Jiabao (23 years old), Wang Zhenlin (25 years old), Wang Fushan (45 years old), Zhao Wensheng (30 years old), Xu Yaren (34 years old), and Jin Shanxian (40 years old), were farming in their hometowns. They were lured by others, saying that they could go to Japan to work, where the wages were high and it would not be difficult to get rich. Ye and others were ignorant and believed it. However, they were afraid that they would not qualify when applying for a passport, so they entrusted this secret organization to find a way. They were hidden in the coal bunkers of the Blue Funnel Line ship that was about to leave for Japan in order to leave the country with the ship. Unexpectedly, their plan was discovered, and someone secretly reported it to the Customs Water Police Station. Detectives Qu Hequei and Xu Leniang boarded the ship and found them. The hiding place was in the interlayer of the coal bunker, and those hidden were very distressed. However, without inside information, it would be difficult to detect. The seven people were taken to the police station. After questioning, it was found that they were foolishly deceived, which was very pitiful. They were sent to the District Court for disposition.</p>
<h3>In the Pursuit of Thieves, a Stray Bullet Hit a Passerby Who Died</h3>
<p>A Thief with More Than Ten Gunshots Wounds Did Not Die</p>
<p>A Passerby Was Fatally Wounded by a Stray Bullet</p>
<p>At 7:45 PM last night, a major case occurred at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue Montauban in the French Concession, where many passersby were killed and injured by stray bullets during the pursuit of thieves. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>A Young Man with a Gun</h3>
<p>At 7:45 PM last night, at the intersection of Rue Xu Jia Hui and the border of the Chinese Concession in the French Concession, the sound of police whistles was suddenly heard. At the same time, a young man, about 20 years old, wearing a black cotton robe and holding a handgun, was running north on Rue Xu Jia Hui and darted into Rue Montauban. Seeing that someone was chasing him, the young man fired a shot into the air as a warning, fleeing and firing at the same time, until he reached the entrance of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory.</p>
<h3>Three Policemen Chased Together</h3>
<p>At the entrance of the factory, a Chinese policeman from the No. 366 reserve team stationed by the police station heard the alarm and rushed out with a gun. At the same time, Xie Huiqing from No. 2 Third Tao and a Western policeman from No. 166 happened to be passing by. They all joined together to chase the thief. The three policemen concentrated their gunfire on the thief's lower body, and the shots were as dense as a string of pearls. Passersby scattered and fled. The thief also returned fire and resisted arrest.</p>
<h3>Falling to the Ground to Be Captured</h3>
<p>The thief fled and fired, but he had been hit by more than ten bullets in his lower body, arms, and legs. His strength gradually weakened, but he still staggered into Fugui Lane. As soon as he entered the alley entrance, he fell to the ground and was captured. First, the Western policeman from No. 2 bravely stepped forward and snatched the thief's gun. At the same time, the police station had heard the news and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives who arrived one after another and took the thief to the police station.</p>
<h3>No Possessions</h3>
<p>After arriving at the police station, the thief was searched thoroughly. Apart from the handgun and clothes, he had no possessions. He confessed his name as Han Hongqing, 27 years old, from Gaoqiao, Pudong. His other statements were vague. Upon closer inspection, although the thief had been hit by more than ten bullets, none were vital. He was sent to the hospital for treatment first. However, the police station examined the route he had taken and believed that he had fled from the Chinese Concession into the French Concession. They sent detectives to the Liyuan Road Police Station of the Second District to inquire, but the police station absolutely denied that a thief-catching incident had occurred within its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>One Passerby Was Killed</h3>
<p>When the two sides were firing at each other, Ma Genquan, a 25-year-old Pudong native living at No. 25 Tanjiazhai on Luban Road in the Chinese Concession, happened to be passing by. A stray bullet hit him in the chest, and he fell to the ground and died immediately. Zheng Guisheng (52 years old), the owner of the nearby Xietai Coal Store, who was walking in front of the door with his young son in his arms, was also hit in the arm by a stray bullet. A Vietnamese policeman from the No. 84 French Police Station was also grazed in the arm by a stray bullet while pursuing the thief. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, while the body of the deceased Ma Genquan was sent to the coroner's office by the police station after notifying the Tongren Fuyuan branch to wait for a report to the Second Special Court for examination.</p>

<h3>Selling Smuggled Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Fined 5,000 Yuan and Cigarettes Confiscated</p>
<p>The Original Judgment Was Upheld After the Appeal</p>
<p>Zhou Baosheng and Zhu Qiming, detectives from the Cigarette Inspection Office of the French Concession of the National Government's Ministry of Finance's Cigarette Consolidated Tax, discovered on February 28th of last year that the Lianhe Cigarette Company in the Xingonghexing Tobacco and Paper Store at 549 Avenue Edward VII was selling smuggled cigarettes. They reported to Western Detective Wu Yaoou, who reported to the Second Special District District Court to issue a search warrant and went to the company to search and seize 1,302 smuggled cigars and five purchase ledgers, which were taken back to the police station. Later, the ledgers were sent to the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Cigarette Consolidated Tax Inspection Office. After investigation by staff member Ling Yin Song, the company sold a total of 3,897.5 boxes of smuggled cigars from February 29, 1932, to January 24, 1933, evading a tax of 4,226.81 yuan. The company's manager, Zhang Chengsheng (57 years old, Ningbo native), was summoned to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer prosecuted him according to Articles 3 and 4 and Penalties 1 and 2 of Article 20 of the Ministry of Finance's Regulations on the Collection of Cigarette Consolidated Tax. After trial, it was ruled that Zhang Chengsheng was selling smuggled cigarettes, and a penalty was imposed, and the smuggled cigarettes were confiscated. Zhang Chengsheng was dissatisfied with the penalty and filed an appeal, which was approved, and the original penalty was revoked, and the case was retried. Yesterday, Judge Wu Fanglian held a trial in Criminal Court Eight. Police Lawyer Lih Jiahuah appeared in court. The defendant Zhang Chengsheng arrived in court with his defense lawyer. After a detailed trial in court, it was ruled that Zhang Chengsheng should still be punished according to the original penalty, paying a fine of 5,000 yuan, and the smuggled cigarettes would be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Implemented in Changanfang</h3>
<p>Rent Collected at 80-90% of Original Price Starting in March</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee's Changanfang Branch on Jumen Road in the South Shanghai District has been established for more than a month. After repeated negotiations with the owners by committee members such as Shen Chengrong and all the tenants, a compromise has now been reached. Rent will be collected at 80-90% of the original price starting in March. Therefore, the rent reduction movement has achieved considerable success. The committee reported to the Municipal Council for verification yesterday. The original letter reads: "We hereby report that the branch's rent reduction movement, led by the efforts of the nine committee members Shen Chengrong, Yao Songbo, Lu Meisheng, Deng Pengfei, Zhou Renshan, Wu Songling, Wang Zaichuan, Wu Jinbiao, and Wu Hezhang, and all the tenants, has been underway for about a month. After negotiations between the representatives of both sides, a reasonable solution has been reached to collect rent at 80-90% of the original price starting in March. We hereby express our satisfaction and request verification."</p>
<h3>MGM Filming "The Good Earth"</h3>
<p>Has Been Approved by the Central Government</p>
<p>MGM of the United States came to Shanghai a month ago, wanting to adapt Pearl S. Buck's novel [The Good Earth] into a film. They submitted the script to the Central Government for review. The Central Propaganda Department and the Film and Drama Review Committee reviewed it and found that the script depicted bandits and other situations in China, which was inaccurate, and it was not approved. Later, the company requested the Central Government to revise the script so that it was completely different from Buck's original work and requested the Central Government to send people to supervise the filming at all times. After several weeks of discussion, the script was revised. The content expressed the spirit of China's inherent culture as much as possible, as well as the development of national rejuvenation, which was in line with the spirit of the times. The Central Government has now appointed Du Tingzhi and Huang Ying to come to Shanghai to guide everything and has notified the local authorities to provide protection and convenience. It is said that filming has begun today.</p>
<h3>Youth Association Fundraising Drive Fourth Unveiling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's 34th fundraising drive has already had four unveilings, with excellent results. It is heard that the grand unveiling will be held this Wednesday, the 11th of this month. With little time remaining, the competition between teams is becoming increasingly fierce. The predicted champions for this session are the four teams led by Zhao Shen, Bi Zishen, Ying Shugui, and Gu Yi, who are seen as the most promising. However, it is heard that the teams led by Li, Qiao Fusan, and Wu Peng, although they have turned in limited scores, plan to reserve a large number of points for the final unveiling. Furthermore, Director of the Health Bureau, Li Ting'an, is also diligently assisting as the captain of the 16th team, having sent circulars inviting all Shanghai doctors to join the association as members or to freely donate funds. In recent days, the number of doctors responding to the call has been considerable. No one can be certain who will emerge victorious in the final unveiling. Yesterday, the overall captain, Mayor Wu, also issued a final circular, stating that the Shanghai YMCA's 34th fundraising drive is deeply grateful for the support received. With only five days remaining until the close of the fundraising drive (April 11th), the overall goal is still short by over 14,000 points. While many of the forty teams have exceeded their goals, many have also fallen short. With the deadline fast approaching, it is hoped that all captains, team members, and fundraising committee members will make a final effort. With everyone's collective effort, success can be achieved. It is hoped that all scores will be submitted before the 11th.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Discusses the Question of Retaining or Abolishing the Music Corps</h3>
<p>To be Presented to the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting</p>
<p>At the Municipal Council meeting on the 4th of this month, during the discussion of this year's budget, a certain director raised the question of retaining or abolishing the music corps. A certain director stated that it is difficult to increase municipal taxes this year, and the budget balance depends solely on drawing funds (two million yuan) from the general reserve fund. After this amount is withdrawn, only 550,000 yuan will remain in the general reserve fund. It is concerning how next year's budget will be balanced. Before making a request to taxpayers to increase taxes, the council should exercise the greatest possible economy. Although the preparation of this year's budget has already been done with tight restrictions, the music corps still exists, which is inconsistent with this. He proposed that at this year's Taxpayers' Annual Meeting, the council should propose abolishing the corps on the grounds of financial difficulty, as the education plan for this year has already been changed due to a shortage of funds. It is inappropriate to spend 300,000 yuan annually to maintain the music corps. After discussion, the majority of the directors agreed to submit a formal motion at the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting and to include a section on abolishing the music corps in the Chairman's speech so that taxpayers can express their opinions.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Sir, I am writing to inform you that Chen Jialu, the owner of Ruiyou Tian Fuzhou Food Store, No. 1376, Edward Road, Shanghai, is an honest Fuzhou merchant. The store has been open for more than ten years. The Hongwan case in Junle Village was solved by Xiao Zhang and others who lived together and has nothing to do with the store. However, in your newspaper's report on April 5th, you mistakenly believed that the store was involved and even exaggerated the facts. This has a significant impact on business credit and personal reputation. As a lawyer, in order to protect the legal rights of merchants and uphold the reputation of your newspaper, I urgently request a correction and provide evidence below. (1) Ruiyou Tian Store has been open for more than ten years, while the room at the front of the house has only been rented for more than a month. (2) After investigation by the police, it was found that it has nothing to do with Ruiyou Tian Store. (See the news of the day's trial.) (3) Chen Jialu, the owner of the store, is from Fuzhou, while most of those who live and visit the front room are from Shantou, Guangdong, not the Fujian gang, nor are there any Fuzhou people. (4) The years of leasing and usual behavior can be investigated by the second landlord and the neighbors on the left and right. (5) The goods wholesaled by the store are sold by major companies and stores and have nothing to do with the operation of Hongwan. Based on the above points, a detailed investigation can be made, and it is not difficult to find out the truth. Please, your newspaper, uphold justice and extend the snow, and immediately correct and proclaim it in the newspaper to avoid slander and maintain commerce, which is a great convenience. Sincerely, to the editor of Shen Bao, Lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang, April 6th.</p>
<p>To the honorable Editor of Shen Bao, I read in your newspaper this morning that the Asia Editorial Office threatened Ma Zhanshan, which involved my name. Some of the facts are slightly inconsistent. Now, I will add a supplementary description in order, and please publish it in the newspaper for correction. In February this spring, I received a letter from my friend General Ma Zhanshan, saying that someone named Ma, No. 4 Sande Lane, Xiafei Road, Shanghai, sent a letter of intimidation, the wording of which was similar to extortion, and asked me to investigate. (The threatening letter has now been sent to the plaintiff's lawyer.) I immediately went to the address in the letter to investigate. The place was an empty house with no one living there, so I replied to General Ma, saying that this kind of thing happens often and that he should not mind. A few days later, I received another letter from General Ma, saying that the intimidator had sent another letter of intimidation and sent a "Sample of Ma Zhanshan's Little Biography," which was full of slander and said that it would be published in the Asia Editorial Office, and asked me to investigate again. Because I was busy with affairs and unfamiliar with Shanghai addresses, I immediately sent the original letter and the "Sample of Ma Zhanshan's Little Biography" to Mr. Du Yuesheng and asked him to send someone to investigate. Mr. Du then entrusted Mr. Tang Shichang to investigate. Later, I heard Mr. Yuesheng tell me that the person had been found. According to himself, he pretended to be a former part of the General, and because he had no livelihood, he had to do this. At that time, Mr. and Mr. Yuesheng both thought that if it was indeed a former part of General Ma, and he had been resisting Japan for many years, although the matter was unwarranted, it was still pitiful. We could afford to bear the cost of some living expenses. I wrote to General Ma, and Mr. Yuesheng entrusted Mr. Tang to persuade them tactfully. The three negotiations at the Great East Hotel mentioned in your newspaper may refer to this. Several days later, they asked for 100,000 yuan for living expenses. Later, I received a letter from General Ma, saying that his subordinates did not have such a rogue. Someone came to Shanghai to file a lawsuit. At this point, Mr. and Mr. Yuesheng had no choice but to give up and ignore it. Then, I read in the newspaper a few days ago that the French Public Works Bureau copied a letter from me to Mr. Du Yuesheng and a letter from General Ma to me at Wang Haiqiu's place. I was very shocked because I had no dealings with Wang Haiqiu, and I thought it must be fabricated. I wanted to publish a statement in the newspaper. The French Public Works Bureau sent someone to bring the letter to confront me. After reading it, I realized that the wording was indeed the same as the original letter, or it was copied by Wang Haiqiu at Mr. Tang's place. Regarding the matter, I have detailed everything to the Second Court of the Jiangsu Special Zone yesterday. As for whether Wang Haiqiu and others are subordinates of General Ma, whether General Ma has embezzled the donations he has received, General Ma and Wang Haiqiu, etc., each have their own methods to defend themselves, and there is no need for me to say more. However, the original letters of intimidation sent to me by General Ma are indeed different from those published in your newspaper. This point should also be solemnly declared. (All the letters of intimidation have been sent to the plaintiff's lawyer for corroboration.) In this era of rampant human desires and confusion between right and wrong, I am naturally unwilling to reverse black and white and disrupt the world's vision. I have always admired your newspaper's strict arguments and advocacy of fairness. In order to record each section of the case related to me one by one, I respectfully ask you to publish it quickly. To be the most grateful for public friendship. This congratulates you on your writing. From Du Chongxuan, April 7th.</p>
<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<h3>The Marriage Problem Expressed in Little Ten Years</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>A letter was received proposing Mr. Ye Yongzhen's book, The Marriage Problem Expressed in Little Ten Years. Although the editor read this book many years ago, the impression left is already very thin: and there is no book at hand to refer to, so I don't want to make any criticisms casually for the time being (if the reader needs it, it can be criticized), now I will only explain the two opinions you collected [and your own] [explanation].</p>
<p>We think that the two opposite opinions you put forward both have considerable reasons on the surface, but in reality they are equally wrong. Why? Because if any problem is not solved from its social roots, but only circles around the problem itself, a correct conclusion can never be reached. This means that they have not grasped the core of the marriage problem or the love problem.</p>
<p>The marriage problem is a social problem, and its change is determined by the change of society. In a male-centered society, women are slaves and spoils of war, and marriage becomes a transaction; in a capitalist society, as you said, everything is commodified, and women are no exception. Although there is so-called free love in form, this love is built on money, as well as the vanity, deception, and promiscuity caused by money. Saying this does not ignore the importance of the marriage problem to life, but rather points out the importance of understanding it from a social point of view. To abolish the marriage of buying and selling, it is not successful to eliminate the remaining feudal forces; to enjoy true free love, it is also not successful to change the private property system. This point is not the question you want to ask, but it is the starting point for solving general problems. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>The Origin of Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Da Qi</p>
<p>The origin of Children's Day is that the Shanghai Children's Care Association petitioned the National Government in the 20th year of the Republic of China to set the festival on April 4th. After the government approved it, this year is the third year, just like a child who is three years old. The term Children's Day originated in foreign countries. For example, Children's Day in the United States is on May 1st, and the second week of December is called the Happy Day for Poor Children. The United Kingdom sets July 14th as Children's Day, and Children's Day in Japan is divided into two days for boys and girls. March 3rd is set as Girls' Day, and May 5th is set as Boys' Day. No matter which country's children, on this day, lectures are held all over the country to discuss children's issues, how to improve them, and how to seek happiness? There are also amusement fairs to provide entertainment for children on this day. The fathers and mothers of children all over the country give their children new clothes to wear, just like the usual festival situation in our country. What is particularly special is that the White House in the United States is open on Children's Day, and children can freely go in and play. When the President sees them, he also shakes hands with many children, and the President sends a bag of candy and a book to everyone who goes to the White House to play!</p>
<p>We Chinese also recognize that children are the masters of the future, so we learn from foreign countries and set April 4th as Children's Day, one is to awaken the people of the whole country to pay attention to children, and the other is to promote the children of the whole country to reflect on themselves: how much they expect of children by valuing them so much!</p>
<h3>Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>I want to be a Boy Scout:</p>
<p>I don't want to wear that pointed felt hat, that neat short uniform, tie that green tie, or hang that bright badge.</p>
<p>I don't want to live in that open-air camp, sing those joyful songs, eat that self-cooked wild game, or play those group games.</p>
<p>I love group life: I love the little friends all over the world even more. They are all my brothers and sisters: we want the same work! The same rest! The same enjoyment!</p>
<p>We do not avoid dangers or fear difficulties. We often go to the fields to catch pests, and often go to the mountains and forests to hunt wild animals. When we encounter rivers blocking our way, we build bridges to pass; when we encounter pits and ditches hindering us, we work together to fill and level them. In the dark night, we light torches to make the darkness as bright as the daytime.</p>
<p>We want to accomplish great undertakings, we want to find the true meaning of life, we hold hands and advance bravely, and we will eventually achieve final victory.</p>
<p>We want to be a team of brave Boy Scouts!</p>
<h3>Several Diligent and Hard-Studying People in Ancient Times</h3>
<p>— Wu Jinhua</p>
<p>Children: Are you diligent in your schoolwork? Now, I will introduce you to several [diligent and hard-studying people in ancient times]. First, [Kuang Heng] was extremely studious, but because his family was poor, he often chiseled through the wall of his neighbor's house to draw light and read. Second, [Zhu Maichen] was also extraordinarily studious. Before he became successful, he carried firewood to the market, forgetting to sell it because he was reading. Third, [Sun Kang]'s family was too poor to afford oil lamps, so he often borrowed the reflected light of snow to read. Fourth, [Sun Jing], fearing that he would fall asleep and abandon his studies, tied his hair to a beam above his head while reading. Fifth, [Cheng Gong] herded pigs as a child. He happened to pass by a school and, hearing the sound of reading, went inside to ask the teacher to teach him. He was allowed to attend, and he studied extremely hard, later becoming a great Confucian scholar. Su Qin loved to read. Whenever he felt sleepy, he would stab his thigh with an awl. Eventually, his studies were completed, and he became the prime minister of six states.</p>
<p>Children: The above are several diligent scholars. Do you want to become great people like them? Then, you should study hard.</p>
<h3>Cockfighting</h3>
<p>— Pan Chengzhen</p>
<p>Little chickens! Little chickens!</p>
<p>You fight so interestingly!</p>
<p>You give him a bow,</p>
<p>He also gives you a bow.</p>
<p>Little brother hits big sister!</p>
<p>Big sister hits little brother!</p>
<p>Butterflies</p>
<p>Red butterflies,</p>
<p>White butterflies,</p>
<p>Flying in pairs onto green vegetable leaves</p>
<p>Green! White! Red!</p>
<p>Blue Sky, White Sun, Full Earth Red!</p>
<h3>Resistance</h3>
<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>The hateful winter has finally gone, and the welcome spring has arrived. At this time, everything on the earth shows the signs of revival. Especially in the fields in the countryside, the lush green vegetables bloom with golden flowers, swaying with the wind. The red sun is gradually sinking towards the west.</p>
<p>At this time, a fire-yellow snake is coiled in the messy weeds, searching for food.</p>
<p>Here, "ge ge ge" is calling loudly, and there, "ge ge ge" is answering, turning a quiet countryside into a bustling place.</p>
<p>The big snake wanted to eat the frogs, so it sneaked over and swallowed a small frog whole. The rest of the frogs fled for their lives.</p>
<p>Seeing their companion being snatched away by the robber-like snake, the frogs held a temporary meeting. A larger and smarter frog proposed: "Our companion has been snatched away by the robber. If we continue like this, and don't rise up to resist, I'm afraid we will become extinct, and we will have nowhere to live." Then, one frog said: "We are weak and small. How can we resist that ferocious robber!" Another frog thought for a while, stood up and said: "It doesn't matter, as long as we can unite, be consistent with the outside world, fight the robber desperately, and resist to the end, we will definitely achieve victory." Everyone agreed, and they were determined to unite. Sure enough, they subdued the robber-like snake as if it had been ironed with an iron.</p>
<h3>The Bucket with a Bottom and the Bucket Without a Bottom</h3>
<p>— White Goose</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a very wealthy man who had a lot of family property. People said that he came from a very poor background. Therefore, a poor man also wanted to become wealthy like him. One day, when there was an opportunity, he asked the wealthy man to teach him the method of getting rich.</p>
<p>The wealthy man was very polite, but he did not teach him immediately. He only said: "I have no method. If you trust me, then take these two buckets to fetch water. Today, use the one with the bottom to fetch water and the one without the bottom to hold it." As he spoke, he took out two wooden buckets of the same size, one with a bottom and one without a bottom.</p>
<p>The poor man listened to him. He fetched water until evening, but there was no water in the bucket at all, because the water fetched with the bucket with the bottom immediately flowed out when it was put into the bucket without the bottom. He told the wealthy man the result. The wealthy man said: "Very good, tomorrow you do the opposite. Let the bucket with the bottom hold and the one without the bottom fetch." The poor man did as he was told again. As a result, the bucket with the bottom was full, because even though there were only two or three drops of water fetched each time, over time, there was more. Then, the wealthy man smiled and said: "This is my method of getting rich! My wealth is not because I can earn a lot of money, but because I can save the money I earn. Conversely, if I can earn a lot but spend it all, isn't it the same as not earning it?"</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Savings</h3>
<p>Hide your money well!</p>
<p>I hide it in the savings jar</p>
<p>Mom, don't use it</p>
<p>Use your own to buy</p>
<p>Mom!</p>
<p>This is the money I saved up to buy</p>
<h3>Evening Scene</h3>
<p>— Tan Baolian, Shanghai Zhirenyong Elementary School</p>
<p>The green trees on the embankment, the green mountains in the distance, and the tall pagoda reflect the red glow at the edge of the sky, making the evening scene even more lovely. At this time, in the garden, the tender green grass stands upright, waiting for the newly emerged moon; the shy morning glories hide in the foliage, much like shy children in the countryside, afraid to be seen. The few green bamboos planted outside the window laugh at the morning glories for not having the courage to raise their heads and greet the kind Moon Maiden.</p>
<h3>The Leisurely and Comfortable Fat Pig</h3>
<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>A two-wheeled cart carried a fat pig with a fat head and big ears, leisurely moving along the road.</p>
<p>"How leisurely and comfortable! Since I came out of my mother's womb, I have always eaten and slept, never done anything. Now, I am even invited to sit in a cart and go out for a stroll. This is probably my natural blessing!" The fat pig said to itself very complacently.</p>
<p>Before long, its cart was pushed into a narrow hut. At this time, its sense of smell suddenly detected a very pungent fishy smell, but it was used to being comfortable, so it had no intention of studying the source of this fishy smell.</p>
<p>"That's not bad! I've always disliked the damp ground and have long wanted to get a bed to sleep on!" It thought to itself optimistically when someone put it on a bench. But in an instant, its throat suddenly felt icy cold, and at the same time, hot blood splattered, piercing its lungs. Only then did it understand; but what was the use of understanding?</p>
<p>Dear children! After reading this story, do you still want to be leisurely and comfortable and afraid of work?</p>
<p>Small Experiences</p>
<h3>Empty Ink Bottle</h3>
<p>Our ink is used up, but isn't there still an [empty ink bottle]? Let's not throw away this [empty bottle]; let's collect them. When we have collected about five or six, we can buy some paint ourselves (about ten copper coins), mix it evenly with boiling water, and make ink. Then carefully pour the mixed ink into each bottle, and it will become five or six full bottles of ink again. After the ink is used up again, don't throw away the [empty bottle]; collect another five or six, and do it again according to the previous method. By doing this continuously, the [empty ink bottles] we use can save us a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Ink Remnants</h3>
<p>— Jianfen</p>
<p>The black ink we use is very long when we first buy it, but after using it every day, it becomes shorter day by day, until there is no place to hold it, and it becomes a piece of [ink remnant]. Of course, this piece of [ink remnant] cannot be used for grinding. Should we throw it away? It feels like a pity. Now there is a method that can make it not wasted at all; that is, put the [ink remnant] in a bottle and add an appropriate amount of water; the [ink remnant] will slowly dissolve and turn into very good [ink].</p>
<h3>The Beaks of Birds</h3>
<p>— Yu Bailu</p>
<p>Birds are not like humans; they have no hands, only two feet. Children! Can you guess what they use to replace them? Feet can only be used for standing, wings can only be used for flying, only the beak is left. Yes, they use their beaks as hands. How do they use them? Let me tell you a few ways, and you can observe and guess the rest yourself.</p>
<p>Duck: You often see ducks. They have a wide beak, and the inside of the beak is soft. Therefore, even in murky muddy water, it can use the soft interior to distinguish the things it contains, just like our fingers. Also, because there are small tooth-like holes on the edge of its beak, when searching for food at the bottom of the water, it just randomly takes a mouthful of mud. When it sticks its head out of the water, it moves its beak slightly, so the muddy water flows out, and the remaining small fish and snails stay inside and are used as food.</p>
<p>Tailorbird: I know you all know that birds use their beaks to build nests, but you may not know how a tailorbird builds its nest. It uses the leaves of a large tree to fold into a tube shape, makes holes with its beak, and then finds fallen cotton, sews it up like thread. It can also raise three or four small birds inside, but this kind of bird is not very big.</p>
<p>Woodpecker: It relies on its sharp and hard beak to drill holes in tree trunks to find small insects that corrode the tree. If you hear the "tat-tat" sound of it pecking wood, don't drive it away, because it is beneficial to the tree.</p>
<p>Walking Stick Bird: It can be said to use its beak in the most peculiar way. Its beak is very long. In addition to using it for eating food, it often stands the tip of its beak upright on the ground when it is tired, just like an old man supporting himself with a wooden cane.</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>Children, you probably understand the beaks of birds!</p>
<h3>Earthquake</h3>
<p>— Xishi</p>
<p>Children, do you know that in past years, we donated money to help our enemies—the Japanese earthquake? Now let me talk about earthquakes.</p>
<p>The earth we live on was initially like fire. Later, it gradually solidified from the outside, becoming a layer of cold shell. Inside, however, it is still like molten material. The earth's crust has different thicknesses, so it often undergoes contraction and expansion. If the contraction or expansion of one part is faster than the contraction or expansion of another part, then cracks or explosions occur. The earth is affected and vibrates, which is an earthquake. Countless years ago, the ground rose up to form mountains. The ground at the bottom of the mountains is very thin, and the molten rock often erupts from the thinnest point. This is called a volcano. There are many in Japan. When it erupts, it can also cause earthquakes.</p>
<h3>Miss Willow's Letter to Miss Spring Breeze — Ziming</h3>
<p>Miss Spring Breeze:</p>
<p>Before talking to you, let me [stand at attention] here and give you a [90-degree] bow to express my gratitude for the grace of [rebirth]! I hope you will accept it!</p>
<p>I was being oppressed by Winter and could barely breathe, feeling dizzy as if I were dead, losing all sense. One day, I vaguely remembered that a gentle girl kissed me and comforted me. I felt a warm sensation on my body. This girl also combed my hair and put on green clothes for me. From then on, I actually woke up and met the world again. But I didn't know what kind of person that girl was. Later, Little Oriole told me that the kind person who knew me was you, Miss Spring Breeze!</p>
<p>Little Oriole comes to me every day. She is also a kind and lovely person who is very good at talking. Her voice is very beautiful, so many people like her. However, according to what she said to me, "[If Miss Spring Breeze doesn't come out to dominate the world, I would rather be mute for life!]" Ah! Miss Spring Breeze, I know now that you are not only my benefactor, but the midwife of all things! No wonder many stiff and dormant neighbors are now nodding and bowing to hold welcome parties!</p>
<p>The world of killing has changed, changed into a green world of flowers, a beautiful world!</p>
<p>Miss Spring Breeze, you are a meritorious person for living things, the ruler of the universe. I hope you will forever spread your grace to the world! Goodbye, Miss! Your Willow, who will never forget you all day long:</p>
<h3>Miss Spring Breeze's Reply</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Miss Willow:</p>
<p>Receiving your letter gives me the deepest comfort in my heart. Before reading the full text, I will of course stand at attention and raise my hand to give you a Boy Scout salute. However, I hope you won't do this again in the future. We will have many opportunities to meet!</p>
<p>What [grace of rebirth]? That's too flattering! I saw the living things in the world, and they were really pitiful! They were beaten by Granny Winter until their skin was broken and bleeding. The weak ones couldn't withstand her power and lay down on the ground for a long time, but that was also straightforward. However, those friends who were half-alive, half-dead, trembling, made my heart ache and caused me to shed tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>This aroused my motivation to come and dominate this world.</p>
<p>At first, I used an extremely sincere attitude to discuss with Granny Winter and told her about the situation of my friends being frozen, but she not only ignored me but became angry out of shame and intensified her oppression of living things. Therefore, I had no choice but to put on a stern face and directly fight against her.</p>
<p>Miss Willow, ah! Her iron fist was really fierce, and I almost failed. Fortunately, I had a full of enthusiasm and a continuous spirit, so she had no choice but to slip away.</p>
<p>Since she has slipped away, naturally, I have a duty to come and dominate this world: in addition to you, I also want to awaken all the people! The man-made world is too hypocritical. I want to use natural power to decorate it into a beautiful world. Miss Willow, follow the beat of Little Oriole's song and dance wildly! Goodbye.</p>
<p>May Little Oriole be equally happy, your Spring Breeze:</p>
<h3>A New Clothes</h3>
<p>— Ge Youfeng, Third Grade Student, Yangxi Shangzhi Elementary School, Xuxi</p>
<p>One day, my mother was preparing to make a new clothes for me and asked me what kind of cloth I liked. I suggested to her: "[Broadcloth and gabardine are foreign goods, I don't like them. I want domestic cloth. ]" My mother listened and agreed very much.</p>
<p>The next day, she asked my brother to go to the city to buy me snow-shame cloth. Snow-shame cloth has good color, a fair price, and is domestic goods.</p>
<p>The new clothes were made, and I wore them to school. Mr. Hu saw them and was extremely happy. He commended me at the morning meeting. And he told the students that if they make new clothes in the future, they should also learn from me and buy domestic cloth. From then on, the new clothes worn by the students were also made of domestic cloth one by one. Children all over the country! We must all be of one mind. Whether now or in the future, it is best to use domestic cloth when making new clothes!</p>

<h3>Philippine Amateur Athletic Association Vice President Qiao Severely Condemns Japanese Threats</h3>
<p>The Participation of the Puppet State Requires the Consent of All Members</p>
<p>Japan, Why Can't the Far Eastern Games Be Dissolved Because of the Rejection of the Puppet State?</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Manila, 7th) The Japanese side is now adopting threatening steps, saying that if China firmly refuses to allow the participation of the puppet Manchukuo in this Far Eastern Games, it will lead to the dissolution of the Far Eastern Games. Today, the Vice President of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association, Mr. Jorge B. Vargas, severely condemned it. Mr. Qiao's speech was published in tonight's newspaper, stating that we do not understand why the Far Eastern Games should be dissolved due to the rejection of one country's participation.

<p>(Nanjing, 7th) It is heard that Hao Gengsheng is going to Baoding from Ping for inspection and will not be able to participate in the roundtable meeting. This meeting is a preparatory meeting before the conference, mainly discussing all competition issues of the conference. The request for participation by the puppet organization has been rejected to the end. Zhang Jiong, the Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, especially solemnly stated because of the report that the Northeast people were allowed to participate in the conference performance in their individual capacity. He said that the reporter's conversation with Yu on the previous day was misunderstood. Yu is not responsible for the Chinese Sports Promotion Association, how can he make this proposal? Moreover, participation in this conference must be based on the country as a unit. It is not allowed for individuals to participate in the performance, which is not allowed by the articles of association.</p>
<h3>Diligent Sports Monthly Declaration Firmly Rejects the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Warn Our Country's Representatives Attending the Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Diligent Sports Monthly, with the purpose of promoting sports and rejuvenating the nation, is holding a roundtable meeting in Shanghai due to the Far Eastern Games, fearing that Japan will raise the issue of the puppet state's participation. It issued a declaration to express its firm rejection attitude, so as to arouse the public to unanimously resist. The declaration is as follows,</p>
<p>"Japan plans for me every day, meticulously, seizes the Northeast forcefully, organizes a puppet state, and now proposes that the puppet state participate in the Far Eastern Games and convene a roundtable meeting in Shanghai, deliberately setting a trap to trap me into acknowledging the puppet state without knowing it. The diligent sports monthly that our company publishes has long advocated rejecting the puppet state's participation. Now the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are also unanimously opposed. The people in the country have not died, and they should rise up together to solemnly warn the representatives of our country attending the roundtable meeting to firmly reject the puppet state's participation. Those who are willing to be slaves of the fallen country will be punished by the public."</p>

<h3>Japanese Tennis Player Sato's Suicide Leads to Accusations Against the Tennis Association, Valuing Appearances Over Sato's Difficulties, Search for Body Lasts Seven Hours Without Success</h3>
<p>(Japan United Press, 7th dispatch from Tokyo) Sato Jiro's older brother, Taro, received the tragic news of Sato's suicide and took a train to Tokyo that night to meet with members of the Tennis Association to discuss the aftermath. Mr. Taro told reporters, "I did not object to Jiro's trip to Europe this time, but Jiro himself actually did not want to go. However, due to the great responsibility, he decided to embark on the journey. Thinking of my younger brother, I could not help but feel pity. Now that things have come to this, I do not want to complain, but the content of the association's telegram ordering him to continue to Europe from Singapore put too much responsibility on my younger brother. The telegram stated that the association is currently raising funds from all parties, so returning midway would create difficulties for the association, etc. I have entrusted the association to telegraph Captain Genmaru to send all of Jiro's belongings from Singapore."</p>
<h3>All Parties Criticize the Tennis Association</h3>
<p>(Japan United Press, Tokyo, 7th dispatch) The Japanese Tennis Association's selection of Sato, who suffered from neurasthenia, as a player for this year's Davis Cup has led to his suicide. Now, criticism of the Tennis Association is growing. Sato left Japan with his illness after being selected as a player and embarked on the expedition. However, his condition worsened midway, and he disembarked in Singapore and telegraphed the association requesting permission to return home. However, the association authorities valued appearances and disregarded Sato's difficulties, ordering him to go to Europe. This shows a lack of compassion, it is said.</p>
<p>(Japan United Press, Tokyo, 7th dispatch) Sato's suicide note consists of five letters. Among them, the letters to Nishimura and Yamagishi briefly stated, "I hope you will work together with Miki-kun to strive for victory. I believe you will surely achieve your goals."</p>
<h3>Circumstances Before and After Sato's Suicide</h3>
<p>(Japan United Press, 7th dispatch from Tokyo) After receiving the news of Sato's suicide, the Japan United Press, due to the significant impact of this issue on the Japanese sports world, specially requested Captain Hakone Maru to report the circumstances before and after Sato's suicide. The reply was received on the 7th. The telegram is as follows: "Hakone Maru, sent at 11 PM on the 6th. Before the ship arrived in Singapore on the morning of the 4th, Sato suddenly requested permission from the purser to disembark and return home. The other three players, upon hearing this, tried their best to persuade Sato to abandon the idea of returning home. However, Sato explained his reasons, stating that he had been lacking concentration recently, and in this state, he would definitely not be able to participate in the competition, and that he was currently physically and mentally fatigued and did not want to continue the voyage, and planned to return home to rest and recuperate. Therefore, everyone recognized that the matter was unavoidable, and allowed him to disembark. Sato immediately disembarked in Singapore with all his luggage. However, that evening, Sato came to the original ship again and told people that he had changed his plans and would continue the voyage. Everyone suspected that Sato had received advice from other sources. On the 5th, before dawn, the ship left Singapore and headed for Singapore. Sato took a walk on the deck that day and was in good spirits. He practiced tennis in the afternoon and went to his room to sleep after dinner. At 8:30 PM, a ship's servant saw Sato take off his pajamas and put on Western clothes. However, at 11:30 PM, when Yamagishi, his roommate, entered the room, he did not see Sato. He searched all parts of the ship with the other two players, but could not find him. He then informed the purser. After a search by all the crew members, a suicide note was found. It was then presumed that he had committed suicide. The captain immediately ordered the ship to turn back and search the ocean surface for seven hours, but the body was not found. He had no choice but to continue sailing towards Singapore."</p>
<h3>Athletes From Various Countries Shocked and Appalled</h3>
<p>(Japan United Press, 7th dispatch from Tokyo) According to telegrams from England, America, and France to various countries, the tennis circles of various countries were shocked and appalled upon receiving the news of Sato's suicide. They all regretted the loss of Japan's most outstanding tennis player.</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, Berlin, 6th dispatch) Japanese tennis player Sato Jiro, who came to Europe from Japan to participate in the Davis Cup competition, unexpectedly jumped into the sea after the ship left Singapore due to neurasthenia. According to reports, when Japan and Germany held the Davis Cup competition last year, Sato and Buri represented Japan and defeated Germany, and his skills were excellent, earning the sympathy of the German people. The sports circles here were deeply saddened by the news.</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, New York, 6th dispatch) After the news of the tragic death of Japanese Davis Cup player Sato reached here, the president of the American Tennis Association, Morihael, expressed his condolences, saying that Sato was his friend and a frank and upright player. Sato's death has weakened the tennis world, he said. Major tennis players in San Francisco were also deeply shocked.

<h3>Current Situation of Yu You Cup Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>The Yu You Cup Basketball Tournament has been underway for three weeks since its start. Based on past results and the players' fighting spirit, Yu You First Team is the most promising. Although Quan Hei has lost once, its fighting spirit should not be underestimated. Among Yu You Second Team and Yu You Third Team, Yu You Third Team is better. It is a pity that Yu You Second Team lacks sufficient reserve strength. Dahua was quite fierce at the beginning of the war, but the team members could not be recruited every time, resulting in little hope. Huadong has made progress in recent battles. Shanggong and Menqing have a more complete lineup than the previous session. Xin Xing, Huo Feng, Leyu, and Youwu seem to be weaker. Fufeng's newcomers have good fighting spirit. The results of the past are listed below.</p>

<h3>The Second Stage</h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>In these turbulent years, some progressive women who care about their own problems, even with extraordinary efforts, cannot avoid a kind of sorrow of being lost in the fog.</p>
<p>This phenomenon does not mean that women in general have lost their way on the road to liberation; but rather that they voluntarily remain in this stage.</p>
<p>When rebellious women began to feel the oppression of intolerable ethics and customs, they bravely raised this question themselves. From reality, they realized that all the old ethics and unreasonable social systems were built on an economic foundation. Thus, they further began to strive for economic independence and raised the banner of [Women's Economic Independence].</p>
<p>Because they wanted to practice this slogan, ordinary women all wanted to find a job: whether as clerks or laborers, as long as there was a job, as long as they could be economically independent, it seemed that all women's problems could be solved at this point. Not to mention distant things, even thirty years ago, ordinary intellectual women and scholars studying women's issues all firmly believed that [as long as there is a job, women have their own economic ability, and at the same time can get all the liberation]. And in China, didn't all the intellectual women around the May Fourth Movement accept this principle without any doubt?</p>
<p>As a result, many [professional women] emerged in society.</p>
<p>However, through experience, they learned a new lesson: professional women still feel a sense of shameful failure.</p>
<p>Sincere women pursuing independence, they are not difficult to realize the special role of shops employing female employees; in China, we can see the facts that professional women are subjected to special insults and manipulation, tens of thousands of women are struggling under the insulting term [vase] with a painful heart for the sake of life, and on the other hand, we can also hear the facts that some female employees have been suspended for refusing the manager's special requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a special situation in Chinese society, and the same phenomenon is also revealed in American society, which has the title of [professional women] as the supreme honor; female employees receive the manager's dinner invitation, no matter what important things they have, they always have to go. In addition, such as dancers, waitresses in restaurants, movie actresses, etc., although they have a job, they are still living in the male society, this is a fact.</p>
<p>As a result, they all realized that: having a job is still suppressed by men, and true independence is still not available. They struggled out of the cage of the family, from the palms of their husbands, and went to society to work, but the result was still in the hands of men, but flew from one cage to another.</p>
<p>The modern women's movement has long been stuck in this gray stage.</p>
<p>In a patriarchal society, the husband is the object of direct oppression and struggle against women, so they all think that having a job and leaving the husband will solve all problems. In fact, everything will not be so simple. Undoubtedly, from the lessons of reality, modern women should all understand that the so-called [women's liberation] is definitely not just a victory over the husband in the family. After they have completed the first stage, they must work harder to continue their more difficult second stage, and further struggle against the unreasonable system of the old society, otherwise it is definitely impossible for women to achieve reasonable liberation.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this era when everything is impossible, almost all problems have become common problems for people. Therefore, women's liberation is not a ridiculous comedy of [male and female struggle]. Mrs. Beard, a scholar of women's issues in the United States, said in an article [The End of Women's Rights]: [Women have left the broad exploration of life and are working hard to win against men in a narrow way. Taking the rights and freedoms of men as the object, working hard to move forward, trying to get the same rights and freedoms as men, this is almost the only way for all women's rights movements. Because of this, they ignored the dangers of the future and were confused by the current opponent. This is like two people flying kites, the man's kite is in front, and the woman's kite is desperately chasing from behind, she ignores everything, she just wants to catch up with the kite in front, or even surpass it. As for all the changes in the wind and clouds in front of the man's kite, they will not think of or see them.] She also said: [For example, women demand equal pay for men and women in factories, but what is the use when men and women cannot find jobs in factories?] From this, we can see that: when everything becomes a problem, women's liberation should (and only) start with obtaining a reasonable social system in a broad sense, in order to achieve the expected success. Although this is a long-term promissory note, it is fully redeemable.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not to deny the necessity of women's liberation in the family; it is mostly ridiculous for women to engage in social movements in the hands of their husbands and in the accumulation of housework, but the purpose of this article is only to point out that after women are liberated from the family, it is only the first stage on the road to the entire liberation, and in order to get the overall liberation, they still cannot ignore the second stage and turn their attention to the social system.</p>
<h3>Opinions of World Thinkers on Women's Issues (1)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>I. Condorcet</p>
<p>When the modern women's movement was still in its infancy, the first to pay attention to it was Condorcet, the last of the great French philosophers of the eighteenth century. Born in 1743 and died in 1794, he was a great thinker and politician of France at that time, proficient in mathematics and astronomy, and was a participant in the historically famous French Encyclopedia. At the age of thirty, he actively participated in various social movements: when the French Revolution began (1789), he was one of the very active leaders. After the revolution, he was elected as a member of the [Legislative Assembly].</p>
<p>In 1787, Condorcet published a famous book called A Citizen of New Haven's Letter, which contained an essence of text on the equality of men and women, which roughly said: Women are also like men, endowed with emotions, and have the heart to distinguish between good and evil, so women should enjoy equal rights with men, etc. He advocated that women should have the right to vote and be elected, and expressed a hope that women should hold all social positions, which should not be prohibited by law. As a result, the theory of equality between men and women began to attract attention.</p>
<p>In 1788, Condorcet published another article in JournaledelaSociele, advocating that women should enjoy all the rights of citizens.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Condorcet was a celebrity in French society at that time, so after he advocated the theory of equality between men and women, French women, who were still oppressed by the feudal system, were awakened and enthusiastically praised Condorcet's proposition and worked hard to promote its realization. At that time, under the wave of the revolution, women's groups appeared in Paris and major cities in various provinces one after another. These groups, they hoped to become a force that influences national legislation, public autonomous organs, and the entire social life, and [fulfill the command of heaven,] and help establish a civic rational state. They advocated that women should fulfill equal obligations and enjoy equal rights. The enthusiastic activists of these women's groups were Gu Marie, the details of which will be described in a special article later, which will not be mentioned here.</p>
<p>The theory of equality between men and women seems to be very bland and unremarkable now. More than 140 years ago, not to mention in our ancient China, even in France before the revolution, this theory was regarded as a flood beast, because at that time France was still under the rule of the feudal system, the idea of [men are superior to women] shrouded people's concepts, women were completely in a position of being oppressed in social customs, and had no rights at all in economy, law, and politics. Since Condorcet advocated the theory of equality between men and women, women's social status began to reveal a glimmer of dawn. So the modern women's movement originated in the era of the French Revolution, but the initiator of the idea of women's liberation should be Condorcet!</p>
<p>However, Condorcet's first advocacy of the theory of equality between men and women in history was not because he relied on his intelligence and fabricated it out of thin air, but had its social and economic background. This background is the alternation of new and old societies in France at that time, the paragraph of the old feudal system and the rise of new production methods - capitalism. He, Condorcet, happened to be in this era, experiencing that the emerging social and economic system needed women's liberation, needed women to be educated, and came to society, so he was prescient, conformed to the requirements of the times, and advocated that women should have equal rights with men. When we study the thoughts of each famous figure in history, we should first pay attention to his social background, which is very important.</p>
<h3>Is Marriage a Woman's Career?</h3>
<p>— Girlfriend</p>
<p>I seem to remember that a certain Mr. published the grand theory that marriage is a woman's only career in a certain publication not long ago. But the day before yesterday, when I read Ms. Wanxiang's article [Talking about the Relationship between Women and Career] in the special issue of Women and Career in the Female Youth Monthly, I couldn't help but be confused.</p>
<p>Ms. Wanxiang said affirmatively in her paper: Marriage is definitely not a woman's career. Is marriage a woman's career after all? Or the only career? For this question, I think it is really necessary to re-determine and study it!</p>
<p>Of course, saying that marriage is a woman's only career also has their so-called many reasons. However, there is only one truth. Which side is correct? In order to make the problem more clear, I think it is necessary to explain in advance what exactly is a career? The meaning of this term.</p>
<p>What is a career? [Directly speaking: the so-called explanation of making a living can be regarded as a career, ordinary people often say to find a job when seeking a career to find a job] This is Mr. [Winter]'s high opinion on the issue of career in his masterpiece [The Great Mission of Women's Marriage] on the supplement of this newspaper. But is this explanation correct? Obviously, this is not correct? Because for whatever question, we should never only make superficial observations, or only follow the stale views of the general world. We must stand on the position of social science, understand and analyze from an economic point of view, and then we can insight into the true meaning of the problem.</p>
<p>Of course, in the current society, most people usually interpret career as a [rice bowl] for maintaining life, but science tells us that common sense is not necessarily correct? The correct solution of all problems still depends on science.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the question of what exactly is a career, we strictly analyze it from the point of view of economics, it is just a part of the social production labor division.</p>
<p>The wild chickens on Sima Road sell their bodies to maintain their lives, although most people think that this is also a career, but in the economic sense, it cannot be regarded as a career at all? Because that is just a kind of deformed thing unique to the corrosive part of the current unreasonable private system.</p>
<p>Since the definition of career is as described above, then it is very obvious whether marriage is a woman's career.</p>
<p>Of course, we also understand very well that saying [marriage] is a woman's only career has an insulting and satirical meaning, because in the current social environment, most women, even those who were able to be economically independent before marriage, mostly give up supporting themselves after marriage and completely rely on men, since most people think that being able to maintain life is a career, it is no wonder that a certain Mr. wants to shout: Marriage is a woman's only career.</p>
<p>According to the above explanation, our final conclusion is: Ms. Wanxiang recognizes that [marriage is definitely not a woman's career, marriage is just the starting point of the common life of men and women]. It is absolutely correct, as for saying that marriage is a woman's only career, this kind of argument, in our opinion, is not only a wrong worldly prejudice, but also a malicious satire for ordinary women!</p>
<h3>Before and After</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>| Fragments of Life |</p>
<p>I remember it was seven or eight years ago, when I was still in school; at that time my life was well-off, and my heart was naive and pure. Based on my sentimental nature, and more influenced by the cultivation of literature, I yearned for an ideal life - the dream of love supremacy. The world's fame and profit, in my opinion, are all external things, insignificant. People's desires often need a satisfaction that transcends the material - the spiritual, I often think this way. At that time, my only hope was to have a lover with noble thoughts and personality, not confined by things, not moved by circumstances, and full of enthusiasm. Poverty is not a concern, and poverty is not a worry. As long as there is a sacred love that transcends everything, I can abandon everything and sacrifice everything, and be intoxicated in the beautiful, gentle, and poetic realm of love for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Starting from this point of view, I searched for my life partner, and soon found him among my classmates. His paper was a powerful medium for me to know him. It was a piece of scenery writing and emotional expression, the beautiful words and transcendent thoughts deeply attracted me. My emotional soul could not tolerate the restraint of reason, so from then on, I recognized him as the character in my ideal, and at the same time, I knew his attitude of being studious and thoughtful, and his unconventional views, which increased my respect and love for him; after a considerable period of acquaintance, we officially became engaged and practiced cohabitation love. After cohabitation, the time of contact increased, and gradually both sides discovered many differences in temperament, habits, and thoughts. As time went by, such discoveries became more and more, and many times even caused conflicts because of this. Of course, our love suffered a great twist, and my soul also suffered a great blow. What made me the most painful was that all my ideals were shattered. When a person once overturns his beliefs and breaks everything, what is left is only vastness and emptiness, so he wanders and hesitates on the fork in the road of life. My situation at that time was like this, disappointed and sad, obviously I had fallen into the abyss of pain.</p>
<p>After many struggles, I finally raised my head from this dark abyss and saw a brighter way out. That is, I understood the mistakes of the past and the path to be taken in the future. In today's society where material is the center of gravity, all human activities are dominated and influenced by its power, and love is of course no exception. This kind of idealistic love is just a story described in literature, and cannot be seen in reality. My disappointment is nothing more than the ideal is too high and not suitable for the actual reason. To avoid pain, we should start from reality, and not waste energy for the sake of ethereal ideals.</p>
<p>Speaking of life, in addition to love - it is just a corner of life, and cannot generalize its entirety - there is a broader meaning and a more important mission. Since people are social animals and a member of society, they should all serve the majority of people in society based on their innate abilities. To be disappointed and passive for the sake of love is not only a loss to the individual, but also a loss to society.</p>
<p>Now, the heavy shadows pressing on my heart - disappointment, sadness, and passivity - have been removed one by one. New courage and new spirit are pushing me forward on the path of life.</p>
<h3>Japanese Women Oppose New Taxes</h3>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<p>| Activities of the Municipal Purification League |</p>
<p>Amidst the general [depression], [deficit budgets] are found everywhere. Tokyo, the largest city in Japan, cannot escape this fate either. The debt at the end of the ninth year of Showa (this year) increased to a staggering amount, reaching the gate of 900 million yen, which made it impossible to turn its head. In order to cover up this mess, the municipal authorities decided to add six new taxes, which are expected to increase revenue by 3.5 million yen. The Women's Municipal Purification League, in which Ms. Shizuichi Kato and others participated, opposed the [special income tax] and [employment tax] in these six new taxes from the standpoint of women. Their reasons are: the special income tax is intended to seize the wallets of low-income people whose income is 600 yen and are now exempt from paying national tax, although it is the product of the cry of the deficit Tokyo City, it is not allowed. As for the employment tax, although it is nominally called the employment tax, among the 118,588 taxpayers, only 5,884 are men (accountants and errand boys), which is essentially equivalent to a maid tax. Whether for families employing maids or for the maids themselves, this new tax is not allowed. For example, in a situation where both husband and wife have to find jobs to make a living due to living conditions, then nanny has become a necessity in life, not a luxury. If a housewife has to dismiss the maid due to the taxation of this new tax, she will return to the family from society, which is not to say that it is a loss for women in society. From the maids themselves, they will be more threatened by unemployment by this new tax, and even if they are not unemployed, they will suffer from the pain of intensified labor and reduced wages.</p>
<p>In this way, they insisted on opposing the increase of these two new taxes, and elected representatives to visit the municipal authorities to demand the abolition of the original proposal. The municipal authorities, however, have different opinions, believing that families employing people are mostly property-owning classes and have the ability to bear a considerable amount of tax. Therefore, the tax regulations stipulate that all those under the age of 16 and over the age of 60, or those suffering from disability and temporary nurses, are generally required to pay the following tax rates. That is, employing one person, paying 5 yen per year, 7 yen for two people, 10 yen for three people, 13 yen for four people, 16 yen for five people, 20 yen for six people, 24 yen for seven people, 28 yen for eight people, 33 yen for nine people, and 40 yen for ten people (calculated per servant), if more than ten people are used, 2 yen should be added for each additional person. It is estimated that 746,923 yen can be raised annually.</p>
<p>For Tokyo City, which is struggling under extreme poverty, this is indeed a good piece of fat. Therefore, it has quite the intention to kick away the women's resistance and implement the new tax.</p>
<h3>Future Female Aviators</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhiru</p>
<p>Ms. Qiaoyun, the daughter of Mr. Wang Zhaosong, a Justice of the Peace in Kuala Lumpur, British Malaya, has recently joined the Kuala Lumpur Flying Club as a flying member. The news has not only shocked the Chinese women's community but has also been greatly praised by people from all walks of life in Malaya.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang is a Straits Chinese born in Kuala Lumpur. She is currently twenty years old. Her biological mother has passed away. At the age of six, she followed her father back to her ancestral home in Guangzhou, and after visiting Hong Kong, returned to Southeast Asia. At the age of fourteen, she graduated from the Kan Cheng Elementary School in Kuala Lumpur and then entered the Methodist Girls' School. She is currently studying in the eighth grade, diligently pursuing her studies, and is respected and loved by her teachers and classmates.</p>
<p>Seeing that few Chinese women dared to take risks, Ms. Wang requested her parents to let her study aviation. Initially, her family strongly opposed it. After many twists and turns and a long period of time, she persistently requested it in a tactful, decisive, and sincere manner, and finally achieved her goal. Now, after school every day, she drives her private car to the airfield to practice piloting with pilot Mr. Newall. She said that once her skills are proficient, she will gather like-minded people to organize a commercial airmail service to connect the air routes of Central and Southern China.</p>
<h3>Women's Topics</h3>
<p>— Dubu</p>
<p>An Example of British Female Workers</p>
<p>Regardless of East or West, ancient or modern, women are known to be talkative. But what exactly do they talk about? This reporter has limited knowledge and has not heard of anyone conducting detailed statistical research. Recently, I came across a scientific study on this issue in a foreign newspaper, and I was greatly intrigued. Therefore, I translated it as follows for the readers.</p>
<p>The statistics were compiled from a recent survey by the British Industrial Health Bureau, with the surveyed subjects being British working women, especially those in the labor force. The central question of the study was what they talk about in the workplace. The survey period was fifty-four weeks, which took a year, and was obtained through scientific and precise questionnaires. The age of the working women surveyed was the adolescent stage of fifteen to sixteen years old.</p>
<p>Number of Topics</p>
<p>About the opposite sex: 42 times</p>
<p>About movies and celebrities: 27 times</p>
<p>About gossip and scandals: 14 times</p>
<p>About suicide, assassination, and accidental injuries: 10 times</p>
<p>About other things: 11 times</p>
<p>About employment status: 37 times</p>
<p>Including 32 negative mentions</p>
<p>5 positive mentions</p>
<p>About outdoor sports and other things: 72 times</p>
<p>About walking: 8 times</p>
<p>Competition: 12 times</p>
<p>Commander's ball: 2 times</p>
<p>Girl groups: 16 times</p>
<p>Swimming: 5 times</p>
<p>Arts: 6 times</p>
<p>Holidays: 8 times</p>
<p>Family life: 7 times</p>
<p>About personal problems: 33 times</p>
<p>About photography: 7 times</p>
<p>Clothing: 12 times</p>
<p>Food: 5 times</p>
<p>Money: 9 times</p>
<p>The total is 246 times, among which interest in the opposite sex and dissatisfaction with treatment are the absolute majority. Confucius said long ago, "Food and sex are human nature." At the same time, women are also human, so the focus of their conversations naturally revolves around the most common human affairs!</p>
<h3>European Marriage Introductions</h3>
<p>— Chi</p>
<p>Indeed, marriage is not the central problem for women, but from an environmental and physiological point of view, marriage is one of the important problems for women. Due to environmental and traditional reasons, women usually have timid personalities and shy habits. Although there are many opportunities for women to socialize in society, due to timidity and shyness, it is often difficult to obtain satisfactory free love with men. Moreover, occasional encounters are not satisfactory opportunities. Therefore, in various European countries, there are organizations that introduce marriages, established in large cities. These organizations enable women to have a more accurate grasp of solving marriage problems and easily achieve the ideal of free love between men and women.</p>
<p>In China's feudal era, marriages were controlled by parents' orders and matchmakers' words. Even today, although the trend of free love has greatly increased due to the changes of the times, the matchmaker system still remains in society. In addition, due to incomplete freedom and improper love, many tragedies have occurred, and women suffer more from its drawbacks. Therefore, the organization of marriage introduction agencies is also worth considering as one of the issues that should be addressed in our country's women's problems. Now, I will list examples from several countries below:</p>
<p>In England, there are nationally established marriage introduction magazine companies. The books published by these magazine companies are all magazines that discuss marriage problems, and experts write them. If there are any difficulties in your marriage problems, you can inquire about solutions. If marriage problems cannot be solved or there are no standards for choosing a spouse, you can also inform the editors of your background, occupation, age, appearance, temperament, etc., and experts will provide guidance in the magazine. The magazine company has two types of mailboxes: A for men and B for women. If you want to find a partner of the opposite sex, you can publish all your information in the magazine, stating the number of the designated mailbox. When a member of the opposite sex believes that you are a suitable match, they can send you a letter.</p>
<p>In Germany, there is a famous marriage newspaper that also completely discusses marriage problems. If you are looking for a spouse, you can publish your background, environment, and the background and environment you are looking for in the newspaper, and inform the newspaper of your name and address. If someone responds, they can send a letter to the newspaper, stating the number of the advertisement. The newspaper will keep the names and addresses of the correspondents confidential.</p>
<p>France also has a marriage newspaper, with similar methods to Germany. However, the marriage newspaper company has the right to check the truthfulness of the senders to avoid malpractice. Although the fees are high, fraud and other incidents are considerably reduced. As for Italy, there are also similar organizations, but due to poor management, problems have arisen, so these organizations have not been very developed in recent years.</p>
<h3>Child Rearing and Wet Nurses</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Due to the low standard of living and lack of hygiene knowledge, the Chinese people have never been very concerned about child-rearing issues. Regarding this point, we only need to check the infant mortality rates in various regions to believe it.</p>
<p>Although there are no accurate statistics on infant mortality rates in our country, if we compare them with those in Europe and America, the rate is shockingly high, which is recognized by most people.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the high infant mortality rate. What I want to talk about here is the issue of hiring wet nurses, because hiring wet nurses is one of the most important reasons. In the past, the practice of hiring wet nurses can be said to have been nonexistent. Even if it existed, it was only when the infant's biological mother did not have enough breast milk, and a neighbor or relative with sufficient milk temporarily came to breastfeed. This had the nature of mutual help and did not have the formal meaning of employment. The phenomenon of hiring wet nurses can be said to have only occurred in capitalist societies. The reason is that, on the one hand, the wives and grandmothers of the propertied class, in order to pursue personal leisure and maintain their "beauty," have to entrust the care of their infants to others; thus, the demand for wet nurses arises. On the other hand, due to the bankruptcy of the countryside, impoverished women who cannot make a living in the countryside, although they also have their own biological infants, are forced to come out to work as wet nurses due to the pressure of life; this is the supply of wet nurses, which comes from this. With demand and supply, it is no wonder that hiring wet nurses has become a trend in modern society, especially in cities.</p>
<p>Originally, hiring a wet nurse is not objectionable if it is due to insufficient breast milk from the mother or occupational constraints; however, if it is because of being busy with social engagements and being accustomed to idleness, as well as the superstition that not breastfeeding one's own child is a kind of "preserving appearance," then it is absolutely not right. We mothers should understand that hiring a wet nurse is a last resort; do not hire a wet nurse unless it is absolutely necessary. Because, according to general statistics, the sacrifices of infants on the issue of hiring wet nurses are truly alarming. The harm of hiring wet nurses to infants can be said in four ways:</p>
<p>(1) The incompatibility of milk quality. The breast milk of the biological mother has a natural relationship with the infant's body and is very suitable. However, the wet nurse's milk is not. Due to the different times of delivery or the different concentrations of milk, there are often unexpected concerns when the infant drinks it.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of child-rearing knowledge and emotion. Wet nurses mostly come from poor rural households. Because their lives are simple, they do not know how to pay attention to hygiene and lack child-rearing knowledge. Therefore, they do not know how to guide reasonably in the infant's eating, clothing, playing, and other matters, which has a non-trivial impact on the infant's body and habits.</p>
<p>(3) The danger of infectious diseases. If, unfortunately, a wet nurse is hired and happens to have infectious diseases such as scabies, trachoma, tuberculosis, or syphilis, then it goes without saying that the infant will be infected.</p>
<p>In this way, it is best not to hire a wet nurse unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>However, in reality, as long as the current social system is not fundamentally changed, this phenomenon of wet nurse employment cannot be eliminated. Currently, as a stopgap measure, to avoid infants from getting sick and dying, we can only think about the following when choosing a wet nurse:</p>
<p>(1) The first condition for a wet nurse is that she must be healthy, especially that she must not have any suspicion of infectious diseases such as trachoma, tuberculosis, or syphilis. Regarding this point, it is best to ask a doctor to check it.</p>
<p>(2) The wet nurse's delivery date should not be too far from the date of birth of one's own infant; it is best to be within two months.</p>
<p>(3) The wet nurse must be kind-hearted and her temperament must be gentle. Those who are impatient and irresponsible should not be used.</p>
<p>(4) The wet nurse must usually pay attention to cleanliness and must have some hygienic knowledge of child rearing (as long as she is responsible, this point can be instructed in detail by the infant's biological mother on a daily basis).</p>

<h3>Quiet Gold Market</h3>
<p>More than 200 Gold Bars Remain This Month</p>
<p>Japanese Government's Purchase of Pure Gold Maintains Steady</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Shows Strength With Slight Setback</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was buoyed by favorable news reports and the market trended upwards. However, due to weak demand from banks, the momentum seemed tired. The fluctuations were narrow in the first half of the day, and the market situation was calm. In the morning, overseas silver markets were flat in London and slightly decreased in the US. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange also decreased slightly, and exchange rates rose slightly. London spot gold rose by five pence, US cotton rose by eleven pounds, and US wheat fluctuated slightly. Stocks rose by $0.58. Reports indicated that the Japanese government decided to purchase pure gold produced by domestic gold mines starting tomorrow. The gold market was related to spot goods, hedging, and so the market opened high, immediately rising to six or seven yuan. In addition, reports stated that the Ministry of Finance stipulated that a 2.25% export tax on silver would be levied starting April 6. This news had little impact because the previous levy was based on the silver dollar and this change was not significant. After the opening, the market weakened as Chinese merchants sold US dollars and bank demand weakened. The domestic market stepped harder, and the gold market still fell. It was slightly flat at noon. It was found that trading was not active in the first half of the day, and there were no special changes. The price of red gold was $969. Now, the market situation in the first half of the day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $956.40, an increase of $1.90 compared to the previous close. Goods opened at $6.30. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 1875, and US exchange at $34.75. At the opening, Kwong merchants sold US dollars for August at $35.375. It was once difficult to sell US dollars for August 1875.

Yuan Mao, Yong Zhao, Feng Chang, Fu Chang, Sen Chang, and Yong Ju all participated. HSBC posted the price, knowingly not to move, and rose to $6.50. However, people's hearts eventually softened, and retail investors pressed the price, and the domestic market strengthened again. Bing Hing, Fu Chang, Heng Hing, Qian Chang, and Xiang, etc. continued to sell gold bars. Shanghai sold US dollars for August 375, and US dollars for July 25, but there were no buyers, and it gradually fell to $4.60. Datong was willing to sell US dollars for this month at $34.8125. Afterwards, it was slightly flat due to some covering of short positions at low prices. Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, Yong Sen, Chang Yong, Yi Da, Yong Da, and De Cheng, etc. successively delivered gold bars, and it rebounded to $5.60. At this time, Heng Hing and Yuan Mao Yong sold gold bars at a limit price, and there was still a setback. After entering, the domestic market was slightly flat, and there was little trading in the market. Tian Feng Yong, etc. entered one after another, and it rose again to $5.70.

It was found that the highest price in the first half of the day was $956.50, and the lowest price was $954.60, with a difference of $1.90. As a result, it rose slightly by $0.80 compared to the previous close.</p>

The registered price for this month was $956, and the registered price for May was $955. The water supplement in the morning was $956. The price of red gold was $969.

Yesterday, Qian Chang Xiang released 98 public orders, and Yong Feng released 7, which were collected by Ying Feng Heng at 105. The Central Bank's current appetite was relatively quiet. As of today, there are still 203 gold bars remaining for this month, with a total of three long positions, namely Shun Li, Ying Feng Heng, and Heng Hing. There are three short positions, namely Fu Chang, Yong Feng, and Da Feng Heng, etc.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre.

However, after HSBC announced its listing, British and American exchange were flat, and were once flat. Later, the market hardened due to weak demand from banks, and the final transaction was sluggish and the situation became even more stagnant. Extending to the noon closing, the near-term selling prices were British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 1875, and US exchange at $34.8125. Compared to the previous close, there were no fluctuations in British and American exchange.

The transaction volume in the noon market was 300,000. The transaction volume in the small general meeting was 600,000.

<h3>Securities New York Stock Market Rose More and Fell Less</h3>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal report from Xinfeng Foreign Company, the market situation yesterday was that the stock market still did not get rid of its hovering state. At first, due to the exchange authorities' investigation of the manipulation of fifteen stocks by speculators, the market was uneven in the morning. Later, due to the strength of railway stocks, and especially the outstanding performance of the Van Sweringen-related stocks, the market turned firm. There were slightly more sales on the small exchange, and the market situation was slightly tired. Speculative bonds were still strong, and foreign public bonds made slight progress. According to the report from our company's agent, (securities) rose at the end under the leadership of railway stocks, and will continue to rise. (Wheat) was extremely sluggish, and there was no news from Washington, but it did not break down, so do not short it. (Cotton) rose due to peer purchases, the limited price of May contracts, and the prediction that the Punkie Heyser case would be voted on soon. There may be progress in the demand from yarn mills soon. People's hearts are confused, but most are optimistic. Factory absorption in one week totaled 229,000 bales. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,010,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>April 5 April 6 Change</p>

<p>11 Commodities 53.75 93.66 Down 0.09</p>
<h3>The Gauze Flower Seems to be a Symbol of Static Stability</h3>
<p>The gauze market is flat and weary, and the situation is still trending towards softening, but the actual demand can still be maintained, and southern purchases are still dominant. However, the market price is unchanged, which shows the desolation of the market. The factories also have no action, so general retail investors tend to be short. As soon as the market rises, selling starts. In short, the inventory of gauze is too thick and the pressure is very heavy.</p>
<p>Ordinary Gauze Auction</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of the gauze auction market was good. Due to the rebound of American cotton, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and each month rose by one dime. The market atmosphere was higher in the afternoon opening. When the auction came to the third closing, it turned downstream again, and each month fell by one dime. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 17,000 bales. It was found that Yuanda sold 950 bales, Mingde 400 bales, Changyu 400 bales, Shenji 600 bales, Dachang 450 bales, Yongchang 400 bales, and Xincheng 700 bales. Renfeng bought 1,050 bales, Chunji 500 bales, Hengyi 650 bales, Dafeng 300 bales, Yuantai 900 bales, and Taichang 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below:</p>
<p>Gauze Auction Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>April 169.0 168.3 168.8 Up 0.30 48,850</p>
<p>May 173.9 173.1 173.5 - 37,850</p>
<p>June 175.0 174.3 174.5 - 34,100</p>
<p>July 175.8 175.4 175.4 - 30,250</p>
<p>August 176.8 176.1 176.3 - 36,050</p>
<p>September 177.1 176.3 176.8 Down 0.10 4,100</p>
<p>Total 191,200</p>
<p>Gauze Sales Decline</p>
<p>The current gauze sales market is still good, but less than before. It is found that various gangs bought a total of 690 bales of various gauzes throughout the day. The market price is flat. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 105 Yunnan 410 Shantou 15 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 130 Jiangxi 15 Northern Gang 10</p>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. American cotton rose slightly, and the black market price of Indian cotton rose again, so people's hearts were slightly agitated. However, the gauze market is difficult to reverse. The factories are more reluctant to buy raw materials. Therefore, Yuanda sold a large amount when the price rose. In short, the general trend is bad, and the price of cotton is higher than the price of gauze. New buyers are still lacking.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao An Station</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of the cotton auction market followed the upward trend of foreign cotton, and each month rose by 5 to 20 cents. In the afternoon, the bulls closed their positions, and each month fell by 5 to 20 cents again. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 58,000 dan. It was found that Yuanda sold 4,200 dan, Dafeng 2,400 dan, Yukang 3,400 dan, Dafu 1,000 dan, Hengyi 1,400 dan, Changyu 1,100 dan, Yongchang 1,000 dan, Changfeng 3,600 dan, and Yuanxingchang 1,400 dan. Hengyi bought 1,100 dan, Changfeng 2,500 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,400 dan, Changhe 3,900 dan, Tongfu 1,200 dan, Gengfeng 1,200 dan, Shenchang 1,300 dan, Deji 1,500 dan, and Yifeng 1,200 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Rebounds Due to Delivery</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market initially fell due to foreign merchants selling, and then rebounded due to spot merchants buying and shorts covering.

Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Bombay cotton market fell due to long positions closing.

<h3>American Cotton Awaits the Final Development of the Peng Case</h3>
<p>New York telegram on the 6th, reporting on the cotton market in the past week, said that the cotton market was calm last week, all waiting for the final development of the Peng Hai case and other stimuli. Within this week, it had rebounded 40 points from the lowest price, and then a small number of southern sales and long positions closing occurred, and the price fluctuated again. There were also some arbitrage sales to resist foreign cotton, but the pressure was not great. Spot demand remained sluggish, but the base price was stable. Japanese purchases were recent, and those related to the Far East had news of buying new cotton. The first week's weather report of the season showed that the progress in Texas and South Georgia was good, but some areas in the central and northern cotton belts had not yet been completed. Although raw cotton was uncertain, the cotton cloth market was better.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Beiyang Flour is Selling Well</p>
<p>New Stockpilers of Flour are Emerging</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was in good shape. Due to the strong sales of Beiyang flour in recent days, the residual flour stored in the market has been completely shipped out, totaling as many as 200,000 bags. The appetite has been good recently, and attention has been paid to recent standards. With the revitalization of customers, the factories have once again adhered to not selling, and people's hearts are unanimously optimistic. It has also attracted new stockpiling and short covering transactions. This month, the spot flour is active and even more firm. The closing price rose by 1.75 cents, September rose by 1.25 cents, May and July rose by 0.75 cents each, and June and August rose by 0.5 cents each.</p>
<p>Foreign Goods Arrive at the Port</p>
<p>Futures Fall by Three Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market had a slight increase in foreign wheat. 期wheat had merchants throwing in套, and the market also tended to weaken. People's hearts were also empty. Because there were foreign wheat orders arriving in Shanghai, and there were still discussions about continuing to borrow American wheat. After the opening, all months saw a downstream trend. The closing price was down 3 cents in April, down 3 cents in June, and down 1 cent each in July and August. Spot wheat inventories have arrived adequately, and factory conversions are also active. Yesterday, Fuxin, Shenda, and others bought 6,300 bags. Shandong and other high wheat were 3 yuan and 57 cents, Yingzhou, Gaoyou, and other second-class wheat were 3 yuan and a half, and the middle and second-class wheat were reduced accordingly. The market remained stable.</p>
<h3>Late Rice is Highly Determined and Medium Rice is Reduced</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs surged, totaling more than 80 numbers (more than 8,000 stones). Among them, late rice was the most abundant, and thick japonica rice and various colors accounted for half. The sales of late rice have also become smoother. At the beginning of the market, Nanyang, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other gangs took action to purchase, and the Beiyang gang was particularly strong until the closing. A total of 2,450 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other goods were delivered. However, customers saw the surge of goods and were very strict in their selection. High-quality goods were slightly taken, and there was an ambiguous attitude towards medium and second-class goods. The eating plate problem was therefore difficult to relax. Fortunately, the sellers insisted, and a situation of high determination and medium depreciation appeared. For example, the price of Qingjiao and Songsi was stable, and the price of Fengjing and Xilian was slightly modified by 2 or 3 cents. The japonica rice from Changbang, Sutong, and Nangang was transformed into a strong urban and rural store appetite, resulting in a balance between arrival and sales. However, because there were still remaining goods, the general trend was slightly soft, and the market price was neither honored nor disgraced, and remained at the old level. The status of Duyangjian was determined, and the sales of Bianyin Yuan suddenly became prosperous, and the market atmosphere turned up slightly.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 or 19 ships arrived from various places in Hexia. Due to the problem of斛师 in the market sales, it has not been completely resolved, so there are very few peers opening斛. There are few buyers and sellers on the market, and few transactions are made. The market shape is firm in various colors.</p>
<p>Guest Xian Arrives and Sells Actively</p>
<p>Yesterday's guest Xian market situation, Xin Youhuiji rice and other continuous arrival in Shanghai, Shashi Zaoshi and Jiangbei Anhui various properties also have installed, so although there are this guest happy to do, the market is still balanced, the arrival is mostly sporadic in the city. Hunan rice has recently seen a profit in the Shanghai price increase, also gradually loaded, but Jiangxi has local military and civilian large needs, before the early rice is not new or difficult to arrive, that is, this year's arrival of Jiangxi rice are last year's saved for installation of goods, new is difficult to pass the profit, yesterday the city is still the most greedy in Fuzhou, a total of 400 bags of Hunan rice, 110 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,349 bags of Jiangbei Nanjing Chuzhou Wuxi rice, 667 bags of Zaoshi Shashi brown rice, the street to Hunan Ji Jing 1,200 bags, the market price is similar to the previous city, the post-form is still in the standing situation.</p>
<h3>Foreign Zhuang Rapeseed is Traded in Batches</h3>
<p>Soybeans Still Lack Stability</p>
<p>Rapeseed transactions are mostly carried out in secret, so there is a lack of real information, and the market situation is flat and tired. At present, there are still 450,000 bags of Pinghu goods at the bottom, and most of the properties are fixed, and the market price is not easy to over-repair. Yesterday, I heard that 1,000 bags of Pinghu goods were traded, and the price was 4 liang and 2 and a half qian. According to the old rules, there are still 2 qian in the market, but it is not certain. The trend of soybeans is still difficult to stand, although the source is small, but the sales are light, yesterday the total market traded 6 cars, so people's hearts can not help but weaken, the market fell by 2 or 3 cents again.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Tianjin Qing Gang Purchases Raincoat Cloth</p>
<p>The retail and wholesale transactions of wool and velvet were still booming yesterday. The market price of raincoat cloth was slightly firm, especially single-sided open water beauty, because the Qingdao and Tianjin gangs searched for it. Yuanzang colors are especially lively. Yesterday, the industry sold 14 boxes of thick and thin raincoat cloth, including 9 boxes purchased by the Tianjin gang and 5 boxes by the Qingdao gang. The inner single-sided open water beauty accounted for 11 boxes, elephant skin 元常 blue-grey thin goods only had 3 boxes. Ningfeng spot goods and Yikang Changji both had sales. There were 7 boxes of brokers' resales. The transaction price of 4026 positive header was 5 yuan and 2 and a half cents for net plate, and the transaction price of 2225 as 4 yuan was the picture of elephant skin thin raincoat cloth was 3 yuan and 2 and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea</h3>
<p>China Silk Seeks External Development</p>
<p>Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have recently experienced slow sales of Chinese silk, which is purely due to the lack of a perfect organization in the sales aspect, so when foreign cities need it, there is nowhere to buy Chinese silk. It is believed that without organizing a large-scale raw silk foreign trade agency, it is impossible to save the current crisis. Therefore, it is specially recommended that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce set up a sales general office in Shanghai, and set up sales offices in Lyon and New York to observe the silk sales situation in France and the United States at any time and the market price situation, and to identify factory silk to various silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and transport it for direct sales.</p>

<h3>The Process of Chinese Directors in the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>— Gongpu</p>
<p>Last time, this reporter wrote an article discussing the Shanghai municipal election issue. The main point of that article was to explain that citizens should pay close attention to municipal elections and should not take them lightly, in order to promote citizens' interest in participating in politics. Now, I will briefly describe the origin of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Organization (i.e., the Municipal Council, its English name being shangbaemunicepalcouncil, which is [Shanghai Municipal Government]) and the process of Chinese people joining the Municipal Council as directors, so that the general public can understand why there are Chinese directors in the Municipal Council and what efforts we should make regarding Shanghai's municipal affairs.</p>
<p>The opening of Shanghai as a concession was based on the Treaty of Nanjing in 1843, and the Treaty of Nanjing was a treaty signed between our country and Britain after the Opium War. Everyone knows this, so there is no need to elaborate. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council did not exist immediately after the establishment of the concession. It went through many transformations to form its current organization. The original purpose of the 1845 Land Regulations was only to explain the relationship between Chinese and British people's land property, without any provisions for municipal organizations. Therefore, at that time, municipal affairs in the concession and the management of expatriates from various countries were still the responsibility of the consuls of each country. The regulations only stipulated that "[the British Consul may appoint impartial merchants to organize a [Road and Wharf Committee]]." Later, during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion, the number of Chinese people fleeing to the concession increased, and expatriates from various countries were afraid of being disturbed by the war. Foreigners all felt the danger of not having a unified organization. As a result, the 1854 Amended Land Regulations were created, which contained provisions for municipal organizations. This was the initial organization of the current Municipal Council. However, the power of this organization at that time was only to have the power to tax and police. It was not a true municipal government. The completion of a true municipal government was the result of gradual evolution later. This article is intended to explain the issue of Chinese representation, so it only describes the origin of the Municipal Council. As for its evolutionary process, it is not necessary to discuss it, so it will not be discussed.</p>
<p>In the Land Regulations passed by foreign taxpayers in 1866, there was a principle of Chinese representation, but it has not been implemented. The reason why it was not implemented, according to the Feitang Report, is that no one knows until now. However, although he did not explain the reason, two sentences are worth noting. He said: "[On the other hand, the proposal made in 1866 may have been too early considering the actual situation at the time. At that time, it may not have been easy to find one or two leading Chinese people in the concession who were willing to take responsibility for serving on the advisory committee... Before 1906, the Chinese people in the Public Concession had never clearly demanded it]." According to this, the fact that the municipal administration was completely monopolized by foreigners was actually due to the fact that our own people were not good, neglecting their rights and not intervening. Later, foreigners, seeing the ease with which the Chinese could be dealt with, did not pay attention to our demands, and the reason for this was also this.</p>
<p>Now, the process of our people's request to join as representatives will be described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In 1906, the Chinese people made a request to the Municipal Council based on the aforementioned regulations, hoping that the Municipal Council would accommodate the opinions of the Chinese side and hire Chinese people as consultants. The origin of this request was due to the so-called "Mixed Court Riot" at that time. Why did this riot happen? According to Feitang, it was caused by the dispute between the Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities, but why would the dispute between Chinese and foreign authorities cause "rioters" to riot? Although Feitang did not mention this at all, we can imagine that there must have been another reason. However, this request was unanimously approved by the directors of various industry associations, and the proposed Chinese Merchants Advisory Committee was "[purely representing the Chinese business community]" and "[representing the banking and commercial interests of the Chinese people in the Public Concession]," not for the general public to enjoy municipal benefits. However, even this request was rejected by the foreign taxpayers' meeting, and the result was not implemented.</p>
<p>(2) The second formal proposal was submitted in 1915, which was one of the conditions contained in the draft treaty for the expansion of the Public Concession discussed by the consular countries and the Chinese authorities at that time. The main point was "[using the employment of consultants as a satisfactory solution]," not increasing the number of Chinese directors. The Municipal Council solemnly stated: "[The reason for its recognition is to resolve the difficulties it has repeatedly encountered, not for the Chinese to interfere in the administration of the concession]." However, although this request was accepted by the foreign taxpayers' meeting, it was still not implemented in fact.</p>
<p>(3) In 1920, due to the increase in municipal taxes, there was a riot, so the Joint Association of All Roads Business Circles requested the Municipal Council to add Chinese representatives. At that time, although the Municipal Council approved the consultant system, it strongly opposed the addition of Chinese directors, because their opinion was: "[In fact, the Chinese people's residence here can almost be said to be due to tolerance, and there is no legal right to demand participation in our administration]." After the matter was brought to the attention of the leading consul by the Chief Executive, and approved by the foreign taxpayers' meeting, it was formally established, but this association had no achievements or results whatsoever.</p>
<p>(4) In 1925, due to the May 30th Massacre, the anti-imperialist trend was high, and foreigners, threatened by this, agreed to the request to increase the number of Chinese directors to three. However, due to the dispute over the number of seats, it was delayed for two years before the Chinese directors officially took office.</p>
<p>(5) In 1930, the number of Chinese directors increased to five. At this time, there were a total of fourteen directors, with nine foreigners.</p>
<p>In summary, there are three points that we should deeply recognize and be aware of, namely (1) The Westerners' permission for Chinese people to join the Municipal Council is entirely based on their convenience in handling affairs, and not based on the principles of democracy, or recognizing the rights of the Chinese people. They do so because the majority of the concession residents are Chinese, and Chinese taxes account for more than 55% of the Municipal Council's tax revenue;</p>
<p>(2) The reason why Westerners do not accommodate the demands of the Chinese people is because the Chinese people themselves give up their rights, and the requesters are only a few people;</p>
<p>(3) Only when the people are united and make firm demands can Westerners be persuaded to comply. Gentlemen who advocate national revival and democratic politics must not neglect this point in order to be successful.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>［A Long-Term Worker's Wage, a Pipe of Tobacco!］</h3>
<p>— Wang Xizhe</p>
<p>In my hometown, Yixing, the situation is roughly the same as in other counties in the south of the Yangtze River. Long-term workers are divided into four types: those who herd cattle are called "young lads," those whose energy development is half-mature are called "stable lads," the young and strong are formal long-term workers, and the old, weak, and sick are in the ranks of the disabled. Among them, long-term workers are the main force in farming.</p>
<p>The annual salary of a long-term worker ranges from twenty-one or two yuan to twenty-seven or eight yuan. Only families where the boss cannot personally work in the fields hire a "foreman lad" for thirty yuan a year to replace the boss in fulfilling the supervisory duties. This is mostly done by the boss's relatives, nephews, or cousins.</p>
<p>The annual work of a long-term worker is to go to the fields before dawn during the busy farming season, and return home groping for farm tools at night. If they are sick for three days, they have to find a substitute, paid for by the long-term worker. When field work has not yet started or has been completed, they have to transport manure to the town, go up the mountains to cut firewood, go down to the river to get mud, row boats, push carts, weave straw goods in the cow shed, weave bamboo objects, and beat and . There are very limited days off. As for the hardships of long-term workers, such as the wind and rain in spring and the plum rain season, the sun and heat in summer and autumn, and the wind and snow in winter, my pen cannot describe them.</p>
<p>The combination and treatment of long-term workers and bosses are as follows: around the Winter Solstice, in the early morning teahouses in the village or town, a third party acts as an intermediary to introduce the two parties to discuss work. After the wage is agreed upon, the long-term worker has to invite the boss and the intermediary to dinner. On the fifth day of the first lunar month of the following year, the boss sets up a rich feast to invite all the long-term workers and the intermediary. This is called "tying the nose wine," meaning that like a耕牛, the nose is tied with a rope, and they have to bury themselves in work. If they look up or wag their tails, the boss's whip can be used at any time, until the evening of the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month when they have prepared all the New Year's food for the boss, they leave the boss's house like wild dogs with their tails between their legs after eating some rice flour dumplings. Throughout the year, they eat three meals a day: white porridge in the morning, rice at noon, and vegetables in the evening, as well as taro or yam porridge, coarse rice dumplings, and noodle soup. During the busy farming season, there are oil pancakes and liquor brought to the fields at noon, those with a big temper often get to eat them.</p>
<p>The way long-term workers withdraw their wages and take holidays is as follows: after agreeing on the wage and inviting the boss and intermediary to dinner, they can withdraw one-quarter of the wage in advance. Later, on holidays such as the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the eighth day of the second lunar month, the day after transplanting rice seedlings, the twenty-third day of the sixth lunar month, the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, and the thirteenth day of the ninth lunar month, they can withdraw half a yuan each time to go to the streets for a day of fun and drink old wine. When they return, they have to buy some food for the young boss as thanks to the boss's wife for mending their torn clothes a few times. The rest of the money is all spent on a yellow tobacco pipe. Today, the boss goes to the street to buy one hundred copper coins' worth of yellow tobacco and a pack of matches, and the next day it is another one hundred and thirty copper coins. The boss records it in the books, and by the time the autumn wind rises, they have already owed the boss a tobacco debt beyond their wages. Therefore, they have to work extra diligently, hoping to get the money to pay for the tobacco in advance before discussing the work, in order to mortgage tomorrow's wages. In this way, those who have been long-term workers all their lives have no way to find a wife to pass on their lineage. Those who have wives bring their little sons to the east family to herd cattle, while their wives live in Shanghai to work in factories or go to matchmaking agencies. Those who do not have wives, after reaching middle age, seeing themselves coughing and hunching over, vow to throw away their tobacco pipes and quit smoking yellow tobacco, and have affairs with widows to have a son or half a daughter to replace themselves as long-term workers. Those who cannot quit their smoking addiction grow old, get sick, and quietly die in a dilapidated temple by the village. This is the life of a long-term worker who has been praised by peers and bosses for planting ten thousand seedlings in a straight row and stepping on the high and urgent waterwheel of nine people per shaft, and has been said to have earned high wages and smoked big pipes of tobacco!</p>
<p>[Money earned through evil deeds will be burned by heavenly fire; money earned through commerce lasts thirty years; money earned through farming lasts forever.] This is a true expression of the farmers' feudal consciousness of accepting their fate. However, the wage of a long-term worker is only worth a pipe of tobacco!</p>
<p>[Rice flour dumplings on the twenty-third, rice on the twenty-fourth (using rice flour dumplings on the twenty-third of the twelfth lunar month to send off the Kitchen God, and rice on the twenty-fourth), the long-term worker eats and quickly rolls away! A broken umbrella in the corner of the door, two leaky nailed shoes under the door sill, the long-term worker grabs them and rolls away. The big boss calls the little boss, give him three flat loads, the long-term worker is beaten and stumbles, crying all the way! Throwing away the umbrella, dropping the nailed shoes, the boss's wife takes them to exchange for candy to deceive the children.] This children's song that the young bosses often sing every year-end, I used to sing to the long-term workers thousands of times when I was a child, and today I feel its bitter taste.</p>
<h3>Yin Mountain</h3>
<p>— Bao Hei</p>
<p>In the warehouse.</p>
<p>Large wooden boxes, barrels, steel bars, cocoon bags - a big pile, a big pile, high.</p>
<p>There is no window, the wind drills in from the cracks in the lead skin roof, calling "whoosh whoosh..."</p>
<p>Even on a sunny day, with the sun outside, work is still done under the glow of fifteen osram lights. A place that has lost nature! It is always bleak.</p>
<p>Four or five stories, a tall western-style building, but without teak paneling, patterned glass windows, or waxed floors, no beautiful decorations at all. Here, there is only cement floor, white powder sand walls, and rough pillars that chafe the skin. Here, there are always piles of goods stacked, on this side, on that side, the outlines of the goods piles rise in the space, pitch black.</p>
<p>Here, it is always gloomy and eerie.</p>
<p>"Yin Mountain!" everyone calls it.</p>
<p>Everyone lives in Yin Mountain, breathing in the foul air, smelling the fishy stench. The air is always suffocating, as I said, there are no windows here.</p>
<p>When it is uncomfortably humid, they want to stroll out to the corridor, want to light a cigarette, but immediately, the red ground white character enamel sign "No Smoking" comes into view, and every character seems to stare with a majestic eyeball.</p>
<p>Majestic eyeballs can sometimes be found on the faces of some noble merchants.</p>
<p>Every time, every time, the coolies walk to the door, they snuff out the cigarette butts and secretly stuff them into their belts.</p>
<p>Come! "Oh yo! Oh yo! Oh yo!"</p>
<p>When they load a thousand pounds of cargo onto their shoulders, this cry full of vitality bursts out from their rough throats.</p>
<p>In the warehouse, the roar will not stop. (On Yin Mountain, the wailing of ghosts will not stop either.)</p>
<h3>Current Affairs Research</h3>
<h3>The Crisis Surrounding North China</h3>
<p>— Fei Li</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the [Tanggu Truce Agreement] around June of last year, the extremely precarious situation in North China has gradually eased, and China and Japan have achieved a temporary so-called mutual understanding. As a result, our compatriots across the country no longer paid close attention to North China, which was constantly coveted by Japanese imperialism, assuming that the Great Wall would serve as a barrier, and they could live in peace and tranquility from then on. However, the facts tell us otherwise!</p>
<p>Now, we don't even need to delve into the history of the past few months. Just a summary of the recent events in North China and the talks given by central leaders after inspecting North China will reveal the following alarming issues:</p>
<p>Japanese and Korean Ronin Activities in Qinhuangdao. (Shen Bao Tianjin Electric Dispatch, March 27)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Conduct Household Registration Survey in Zunhua. (Da Mei Evening News Beiping Electric Dispatch, March 30)</p>

<p>Yan Huiqing's Remarks to Reporters Upon Arrival in Shanghai: [I am going to Pingjin this time to handle personal affairs and inspect the situation in North China along the way. I deeply feel the urgency of the situation in North China and hope that the entire nation will pay attention.] (Da Mei Evening News, March 30)</p>

<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Reinforce Malanyu. (Da Mei Evening News Tianjin Electric Dispatch, April 1)</p>
<p>Japanese Sell Opium, Morphine, and Other Narcotics in the East. (Shen Bao Beiping Electric Dispatch, April 1)</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhang Ji's Remarks to Reporters Upon Returning to Nanjing After Inspecting North China: [North China is fraught with crises, and Beiping is in imminent danger of collapse, similar to the situation on the eve of the September 18th Incident in the Northeast. The day we become slaves is truly at hand.] (Shen Bao Nanjing Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>Main Force of Japanese Troops Concentrated in Western Rehe. || Author's Note: Da Wan Bao reported on March 29 that approximately 13,000 Japanese troops are stationed at various passes along the Great Wall in Rehe Province. || (Shen Bao Beiping Special Electric Dispatch, April 2)</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway East Asia Economic Research Association Sends Specialists to Investigate the Economic Situation in North China and Plans to Establish Special Agencies in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Other Places to Develop Its Resources. (Shen Bao Hualian Electric Dispatch, April 2)</p>
<p>Yuguan Telegraph Bureau Still Controlled by Japanese Troops. (Shen Bao Tianjin Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Threaten Fengrun County. (Da Wan Bao Tianjin Electric Dispatch, April 3)</p>
<p>[Japanese Troops in Gubeikou Reinforced by 400 Recently. Furthermore, in the past two days, two batches of Japanese troops passed through Gu to inspect the border of Chahar. The Japanese are currently rushing to repair the motor roads at Baimaguan and other passes.] (Da Wan Bao Beiping Electric Dispatch, April 3)</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets Actively Constructing Railways (between Pingquan and Chifeng, between Lingyuan and Lengkou, etc.) and Military Motor Roads (between Chaoyang and Chifeng, between Chifeng and Chengde, etc.) in Rehe Province and Along the Great Wall. || (Shen Bao Changchun Correspondence, April 3)</p>
<p>Analyzing the above phenomena, it is very clear to recognize how Japanese imperialists are using the following methods to advance into North China: 1. Military Occupation; 2. Utilizing Traitors and Japanese-Korean Ronin to Create Trouble; 3. Dispatching Personnel to Conduct Inspections in the Interior; 4. Selling Narcotics to Harm the Chinese. As a result, our vast territory of North China and tens of millions of people are becoming increasingly endangered under these four vicious policies of aggression.</p>
<p>[North China is Extremely Endangered!] A few people have shouted this weak cry, but after all, this cry is somewhat weak, and it has not yet shaken the eardrums of the vast Chinese populace and awakened their attention. On the other hand, there is still no news of the government's attitude and countermeasures. It is only heard that Huang Fu is going south, [actually bearing the nature of contacting the highest authorities in Beijing regarding certain important diplomatic matters.] This is indeed difficult to understand.</p>
<p>A Tokyo electric dispatch on April 4 stated: [Japan has no intention of invading China. This can be determined by observing the recent attitude of the Kwantung Army. The key to our country lies in correctly understanding the current situation in North China, seeking to improve the prosperity of the people, and not spreading rumors that shake people's hearts (Author's note: Referring to the talks given by Central Committee Member Zhang Ji after inspecting North China) to the outside world.] It is hoped that the gentlemen of the Party-state will not be misled by this hypocritical defense of Japanese imperialism, and it is also hoped that the people of the whole country will not be misled by it. It is necessary to closely safeguard North China |and even the whole country|. If, in the event of an unforeseen catastrophe, war descends upon North China again, then it is hoped that the people of the whole country will quickly unite and launch a small, elite resistance for the sake of the survival of the Chinese people!</p>

<p>There are also clerks in the warehouse - [Warehouse Gentlemen].</p>
<p>Heh heh! Should there also be such a nice-sounding name? Isn't it the same suffering, having to squeeze in and out of the cargo piles with everyone, overturning boxes and barrels: climbing to the top of the piles, climbing into the corners of the walls, in narrow crevices, in dark tunnels, bending over, using flashlights to shine on the Mark···No···Weight··· on each piece of cargo, shouting with straightened throats, letting the staff of the big merchants record it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the forehead bumps into the corner of a box, the arms and legs are torn by nails, bleeding. There's nothing to stop the bleeding in the warehouse, grab a handful of dust from the corner of the door, pull a spider web and apply it, that's a good method.</p>
<p>In the hot weather, there is no air conditioning, no fans in the warehouse. Clerks and laborers are shirtless, sweating one layer and covered with a layer of dust and sand, panting and panting in the moldy smell. In the cold weather, there is no water heater in the warehouse. Cold air rises from the cement floor. The clerks shrink their bodies and shiver as much as possible. When they can't stand the cold, they jump around. But the laborers can still endure it. They are often pressed into a sweat by cargo weighing thousands of pounds.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Question of [Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?]</h3>
<p>— Ke Shi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chi Fo's [The Broad Meaning of Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?] in the 67th issue of the Amateur Weekly, I also feel that I have a few words to say.</p>
<p>This question seems simple on the surface, but it is actually very complicated. It has been discussed as a central problem in genetics. What must first be understood in genetics is: Does the body originate from the germ plasm, or does the germ plasm originate from the body? On this, the ancients spent a lot of thought and established several hypotheses, but the important ones are roughly the following two schools:</p>
<p>(1) Argues that [the egg is produced by the chicken]. Darwin can be taken as the representative of this school. Darwin once established a hypothesis, assuming that each cell of an animal's body can emit a kind of ultramicroscopic microparticle, called [gemmules]. It is said that these gemmules enter the blood and are carried by it to the germ cells, where they are stored. Later, the germ cells develop into new individuals, so they resemble the parent body.</p>
<p>(2) Argues that [the chicken is produced by the egg]. Weismann can be taken as the representative of this school. Weismann once established a theory,</p>
<p>explaining that the germ plasm of germ cells is transmitted from the germ plasm of previous generations, and is not produced by the individual. Therefore, the germ plasm is inherited from one generation to the next, while the cells of the body are produced by the germ plasm. He constructed his [theory of germ plasm continuity] in this way.</p>
<p>These two schools of thought are not only very important in genetics, but also extremely important in the theory of variation and evolution. If we follow Darwin's hypothesis, if the individual is affected by the environment in his life and an effect occurs, it can also be transmitted to the germ plasm and cause variations in future generations. If we follow Weismann's theory, only if the germ plasm itself undergoes variation can it be transmitted to future generations. The influence of the individual's environment cannot reach the germ plasm. Finally, because science values proof, Darwin's gemmules could not be proven, but Weismann's theory found some evidence under the microscope. Therefore, many biologists supported Weismann's theory. Mr. Chi Fo's argument that the egg came before the chicken can perhaps be said to belong to the Weismann school of thought.</p>
<p>However, if we analyze and observe, and then look at it comprehensively, although many hereditary traits seem to be directly inheritable: some new species of variation seem to be able to arise independently - because the reasons are unknown, it seems that they are discovered in offspring due to variations in the germ plasm. But from another perspective, there are indeed many examples of organisms undergoing variation and evolution due to the influence of the living environment. For example, the evolutionary explanation of the origin of mankind is: first there were ape-like creatures living in trees: they learned to sit and stand upright from this lifestyle. And they freed their hands, which they could use to climb branches and pick fruits. When the forests declined, they descended to the ground. Then, they were able to walk on two feet with difficulty, and also learned to grasp wooden sticks and use tools with their hands. The upright posture and the new environment helped to develop the brain, and the development of the brain also helped to develop work skills. From these examples, it can be seen that variation and evolution are actually related to the individual's living conditions. It is difficult to explain by simply attributing it to changes in the germ plasm. Therefore, we can very well say that the life of the chicken can affect the egg, and the egg transmits this influence to the chicken. In recent years, Conklin proposed that modern biologists have a tendency to view organisms as a whole; Thomson further explained that organisms should be observed in conjunction with the environment. Perhaps this is due to these facts?</p>
<p>Now, let's put aside empty talk and talk about the topic itself again. Mr. Chi Fo believes that there must be an egg before there is a chicken. This is certainly one opinion of biologists, but it is a very serious mistake to cite Dr. Luo Guangting's [theory of spontaneous generation] as proof. It is not necessary for me to say more about the unreliability of Dr. Luo's words. Just read the letters from Hartman of Lingnan University and Hoarepoeue of the Pasteur Institute (Continental Magazine, Volume 2, Issue 5), and the discussions of several domestic scientists, and you will know. As for words such as [a sparrow entering the sea becomes a clam] and [a sheep can be planted], they are not only not commonplace, but also not common sense. They are just like what Hao Yixing said: [The ancients were not precise in observing things and made reckless measurements.] It would be extremely terrible if someone still believed it today.</p>

<h3>Marriage and the Nation</h3>
<p>— Han Ying</p>
<p>As long as we are willing to pay attention to social trivia, we can often discover some facts that are closely related to social problems. About ten days ago, under the headline [Marriage Failed After Two Years], we saw another such episode: Sun Xiu'e and Sun Yusheng have been married for more than two years. Although they live in the same room, they have never had sexual intercourse. Recently, they hired a lawyer to sue Sun Yusheng for being born impotent and requested a divorce. Sun Yusheng claimed that he stopped having sex due to lung disease and did not have any hidden illness. He also hired a lawyer to apply for mediation.</p>
<p>Marriage and health are very closely related. The union of men and women is a natural instinct: unless there is some physical defect, everyone has this need. But a person must also have a certain condition for marriage; lacking this condition, he has no qualification for marriage. This has long been stipulated in the marriage laws of various European and American countries. When a person wants to marry, he must undergo an examination by a doctor to prove that his body has reached maturity and has no defects. Only then will the state allow marriage; conversely, if the body is not fully developed or has incurable diseases, he will not be granted the right to marry. This is certainly a loss for a small number of people, but it is very beneficial to the majority. This not only relates to the happiness of individuals or families; its influence on the country, the nation, and even all mankind is also very significant.</p>
<p>But it is not so in our country. It is very free and convenient for people in our country to marry. Whether it is a man or a woman, as long as they are willing to marry themselves, or their parents want them to marry, they can implement it immediately. As for whether the age has reached adulthood, whether the body development is complete, or whether they have infectious diseases, hereditary diseases or hidden illnesses, they can ignore everything. Not only do they ignore it themselves, but the country does not interfere. Therefore, the marriage situation in our country has all kinds of strange phenomena. [The command of the parents and the words of the matchmaker] are always the most compliant with the rules; betrothal from the womb or child brides have almost become customs. They do not care at all about the health status of both men and women, whether it has reached or can reach a level and qualification for marriage, adhering to the [marriage for the sake of marriage] purpose. Small couples of thirteen or fourteen years old can create small citizens, and it is spread in all directions as a good story: bedridden, even dying, with a body temperature about to dissipate, the parents sometimes have to find a bride for him to cheer him up, hoping that he can be brought back to life. Some men with sexually transmitted diseases marry because they superstitiously believe that intercourse with a virgin can relieve their pain. Hereditary diseases are even more latent and difficult to see. Even if they can be inherited, that is a matter for later generations, and it cannot be used as an obstacle to our marriage. Not only is old-style marriage like this, but isn't free love marriage the same? Some of them are immersed in temporary enthusiasm, so they can't take care of anything else; some are lured by money or beauty, what does health matter? In short, marriage in our country is too free and too casual. The union of Sun Xiu'e and Sun Yusheng is not considered how unique.</p>
<p>In our view, health is not only related to marriage, but health is even the most important condition among all marriage conditions. It must be known that the union of the two sexes, in addition to mutual assistance and satisfying sexual life, also bears a mission of reproducing the race. The so-called reproduction of the race is not just about giving birth to children and passing on grandchildren. Attention should also be paid to the improvement of the race, so that one's own race can develop upward. This is the teaching that modern eugenics gives us. Therefore, a person should wait until his body has matured and has no defects before he can implement marriage; if he does not have a qualification for marriage, trying it rashly will not only fail to bring happiness to himself, but also leave harm to the race. For the sake of personal and family happiness, for the sake of the future of the society, the country, and the nation, people in our country should change their always hasty attitude toward marriage and pay close attention to the health conditions of both men and women. As for the government, it should not ignore this issue. On the one hand, in education, it can use educational tools to vigorously carry out effective propaganda, so that marriage knowledge and eugenics can be fully popularized among the people; on the other hand, in law, there should be a regulation restricting marriage, so that the people dare not regard marriage as child's play. Then, the unfortunate events that occur in the future regarding marriage may be reduced as a result; this is not without some benefit to the development of the country and the nation!</p>
<h3>Vocational Education Now and in the Future</h3>
<p>— Ji Xin</p>
<p>[The most urgent need for Chinese education at present is to strive to develop vocational education.] This is what International Labour Office Deputy Director Maurette contributed to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Vocational education, the name itself has many problems. But I don't want to discuss this aspect. I just want to analyze the educational situation indicated by the word vocational: what path is it taking? What impact does it have on society? And its future trends.</p>
<p>(1) Vocational Education and Commercial Education! If vocational education is done successfully, it is commercial education, and it can be regarded as a darling of the times. Universities have business schools or business departments, senior high schools have business departments, some normal schools have attached vocational classes in business, and there are even independent business schools. In terms of students' future prospects, it is often better than students in other departments, and even better than graduates of normal schools. This phenomenon, like the banking industry in recent years, is a deformed development. The future prospects of business students are good, and the development of banks and other similar businesses makes the city appear prosperous, but the countryside has been depleted and has become a huge belly. This is not a gratifying phenomenon, but a tragic harbinger. They are not direct producers. In China today, they are an unnecessary consumption. The more developed this type of consumption-oriented vocational education, the weaker the financial resources for other occupations will become. If the talents trained by schools and social undertakings show a phenomenon of oversupply, then it is equivalent to ordinary schools, only creating high-level vagrants and an army of unemployed reserves. Even if supply and demand can match, it is equal to digging one's own grave.</p>
<p>(2) Vocational Education and Light Industry｜In schools at all levels, vocational education has everything. Engineering, agriculture, business, and even independent vocational schools. Universities are not to be mentioned, but as for secondary vocational schools, most of them offer textile, dyeing, banking, accounting, crafts and other departments. Although there are also departments related to mechanical industry, agriculture, etc., it is rare to find ones that match the name and reality and have some achievements. Therefore, the development of secondary vocational education can at best provide some help in the field of light industry. In China today, light industry has two fates: first, the development of light industry is impossible. In the current stage of world economic panic, the dumping policies of capitalist countries have swallowed the entire colonial market, and even our last drop of blood will be sucked away. What can be done in countries without tariff protection? Second, light industry is not needed. A country that is so backward and fragmented needs a lot of construction and the manufacture of a large number of means of production. In this difficult transitional era, small light industry is of no help and is not needed. Clearly speaking, light industry is a manufacturing of consumer goods.</p>
<p>In this way, vocational education in China has not created much welfare. The biggest reasons are two: first, the deformed development of the capital economy has made commercial education occupy an important position in vocational education. Second, because of the copying of the education system, vocational subjects far from reality are opened in the same way as drawing a gourd. We still need vocational education, but the future direction must be re-opened.</p>
<p>What kind of vocational education is needed, this issue has a wide scope. Here, only one trend can be proposed. That is, what we need in the future is productive vocational education.</p>
<p>Productive vocational education has two characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) Under the current situation, it is necessary to exclude consumption-oriented vocational education, to enable everyone to directly participate in production, and to build a new type of country.</p>
<p>(2) Develop heavy industry, use China's natural wealth, mechanize various industries and agriculture, and even require their electrification.</p>
<p>Productive vocational education is for society, not for individuals, for the needs of the majority, not for the enjoyment of the minority.</p>

<h3>Bees in the Soviet Second Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>— Pei Ren</p>
<p>Spring has come, and all living things are busy moving around. Bees are one of them. They are a very organized, highly collective animal, which is an animal that everyone is very interested in.</p>
<p>Beekeeping is a very common job in the Soviet Union. From a small and unimportant fragment of the rural economy, bee culture has now become an important department, which is scientifically planned and placed under central management.</p>
<p>In 1929-30, the Soviet Union had already begun to use beehive frames to replace the old wooden box houses for the protection of bees. In 1919, only 17% of the suitable beehives remained on the beehive frames, but in 1926 the percentage was increased to 54.9, and in 1931 it was increased to 61.7. This great progress came with the collectivization of the countryside, and now it has greatly increased. The Soviet Union has put it on a large production basis, and has a special management agency.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the total number of beehives in the entire Soviet Union was 4,466,200 as of January 1, 1931, of which 2,755,100 were on beehive frames. By January 1, 1932, 1,500,000 had been added in collective farms, and 50,000 had been added in state farms.</p>
<p>Beekeeping is being tested everywhere in the Soviet Union, especially in the North Caucasus, Siberia, the Far East, Bashkiria, Ukraine, and the Central Black Soil Belt and other important areas.</p>
<p>One of the important tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan is to increase the harvest of agricultural products. As an important medium for plant pollination, bees play a decisive role in this task. For this purpose, the Agricultural Committee decided to increase the work of beekeeping in state farms. Because not only can great benefits be obtained for agricultural crops, beekeeping can also obtain honey and wax, which greatly increases the supply of human food.</p>
<p>We accidentally hear the buzzing sound of bees this spring, but have we ever thought about what great relationship they have with us humans?</p>
<p>Book and Newspaper Reviews</p>
<h3>Adult Learning</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiyun</p>
<p>｜Translated by Du Zuo and Zhu Junyi, published by the Commercial Press, priced at two yuan and six jiao｜</p>
<p>Of our 400 million compatriots, approximately 80% are adults who have not received education, totaling about 320 million. Many of these compatriots believe that learning is easier during childhood and adolescence. They think that adults have diminished pure curiosity, fixed neural pathways, and lost assimilation abilities, making it very difficult to learn new concepts. This traditional thinking is enough to discourage many illiterate adults and hinder their boundless progress. In fact, according to the results of various experiments by Thorndike and others on adults learning different tasks, such views are completely wrong. He believed that the energy for learning never stops, that adults remain highly adaptable or teachable, and that they can continue to learn after the age of twenty-five. This book reports on the changes in the quantity and nature of learning ability from the ages of fifteen to forty-five, especially from twenty-five to forty-five, as well as the introduction of various learning methods.</p>
<p>The book is divided into thirteen chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, the second chapter reports on the facts of adult learning as reported by general psychology and education, the third chapter compares adult learning with children's learning, the fourth chapter discusses the learning of intelligent adults, the fifth chapter discusses the learning of low-ability adults, the sixth chapter discusses the learning of adults in secretarial schools, the seventh chapter discusses adult learning of secondary school subjects in public night schools, the eighth chapter is supplementary experiments, the ninth chapter is on the difference between completely new learning and age, the tenth chapter is on evidence regarding adult learning, the eleventh chapter is on the reasons for the change in learning ability and the amount learned due to age, the twelfth chapter is on the qualitative differences between age and learning, and the thirteenth chapter is on practical applications. There are also several pages of appendices.</p>
<p>The language of the book is simple and fresh, the translation is fluent, and it is well worth reading. It is hoped that the 320 million uneducated compatriots should not consider themselves too old, nor should they be unduly fearful and suppress their learning. They should no longer use this fear as an excuse to abandon what they should be learning. Even educated compatriots should continue their efforts, because our energy for learning continues unabated and never stops. Today, knowledge advances by leaps and bounds. What we learned from the ages of ten to twenty becomes obsolete by the time we are forty. If we continue to do things according to old methods, we will inevitably stumble and face constant danger. For example, when driving a car or turning on and off ordinary lights, they will not know what to do. Furthermore, regarding basic hygiene and prevention, they will endanger their lives due to negligence. Therefore, if we want the progress of literature, art, and science to be boundless, there is no other way than continuing education inside and outside of schools. It is hoped that adults will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Achievements in the First Year of Office</h3>
<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt, the thirty-second President of the United States, was sworn into office on March 4th of last year. By now, it has been a full year. In this year, some have praised him, and some have criticized him. But what are his achievements? We have no choice but to analyze them from an objective standpoint. Here, due to space limitations, we will only discuss the economic aspects.</p>
<p>The day Roosevelt took office was when the financial crisis in the United States was at its worst. On that day, the banks in all forty-eight states of the United States were in a state of great panic. If it were a president with weak abilities, he would surely be flustered and at a loss in the face of such a serious blow. However, Roosevelt was able to resolutely resolve the matter step by step. The day after taking office, he announced that all banks in the country would be closed for ten days. A day later, he ordered a ban on the export of gold and silver. On the seventh day, the Ministry of Finance issued new banking regulations. Thus, this unprecedented storm was calmed.</p>
<p>With the financial crisis resolved, Roosevelt then moved to rescue rural areas and relieve unemployment. At the same time, he stood on the position of international coordination and discussed international economic issues with representatives of various countries in preparation for the London World Economic Conference. Just as representatives from various countries were flocking to the United States, Roosevelt announced the abandonment of the gold standard and submitted an inflation bill to both houses of Congress. Although this did not disrupt the Washington Talks, it sowed the seeds for the bankruptcy of the World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>As expected, the World Economic Conference held in June ultimately broke down due to the lack of results on the issue of stabilizing exchange rates. After the conference, international economic problems not only did not improve, but also led to the (economic self-sufficiency) of various countries. This economic self-sufficiency was fully expressed in the United States by the Industrial Recovery Act | namely, the Blue Eagle Movement |. Although the banner of the Industrial Recovery Act still had important text transferred to page 5</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>The banner called for [increasing wages and providing workers with methods to obtain work, in order to stabilize industry and cope with the rapid changes of the past two years]. However, today, the facts have proven that this is just a pipe dream. The industrial production index did temporarily increase in June and July, when the Industrial Recovery Act was first implemented. However, in August, the tragic situation returned. After that, it declined almost month by month. Originally, although the Industrial Recovery Act stipulated increasing wages and reducing working hours, in reality, (1) real wages could not keep up with nominal wages, and (2) reducing working hours only reduced the hours of employed workers and distributed them to some unemployed workers, sacrificing the former to supply the latter. Therefore, although this act sounds so appealing, it did not increase the purchasing power and consumption power of workers at all.</p>
<p>Witnessing the return of this tragic scene, Roosevelt quickly implemented a gold purchase policy on October 25 before things completely failed. Why buy gold? This has a dual meaning. On the one hand, because domestic opposition to the monetary inflation policy was growing, the government had to use gold purchases to indicate the stabilization of the currency value (the so-called devaluation of the currency to 59.06 cents is one such indication); on the other hand, the fall in the external exchange rate of the US dollar could stimulate the increase in exports. Gold has already been purchased in large quantities, followed by a tight measure to raise the price of silver and purchase silver. The former is a method of attacking gold standard countries to assist one's own trade; while the latter is a policy of increasing industrial recovery at the expense of silver standard countries (China).</p>
<p>Looking at the economic policies adopted by Roosevelt in his first year in office, we can say with certainty that he is completely standing on the viewpoint of monetary inflation to deal with the disaster of the American economic panic. The effect of monetary inflation is temporary, so Roosevelt's relief of the panic is also temporary. Roosevelt is a political leader with considerable abilities, but even if his abilities were doubled, facing this economic crisis full of contradictions, I am afraid he would end up sighing in vain!</p>
<h3>A Big Girl Receives an Award in the Midst of Children's Day Celebrations</h3>
<p>— Ms. Shen Airong</p>
<p>Because I was receiving an award for the Women's National Products Year essay contest, I didn't have an admission ticket. A big girl like me also had to participate in the Children's Day celebration. "The award ceremony is on the third floor," they said to me after knowing my background.</p>
<p>The rubber soles of my basketball shoes kissed all three floors of the stairs. Three fellow award recipients from Songjiang Girls' High School had arrived before me, wandering aimlessly on the third floor. After being guided by a receptionist, they finally learned that the essay award ceremony was being held in the hall on the second floor.</p>
<p>Running to the second floor, a burst of noisy and chaotic voices came from the dark, crowded heads in front of the stage, suppressing and raising the sharp voice of the lady speaking on the stage.</p>
<p>It's Children's Day! In front of the stage were innocent faces holding gifts and smiling. They probably weren't interested in the speech, right? They were just constantly restless, disrupting the order of the venue.</p>
<p>A round of applause sent the lady down and welcomed the man. His mouth opened like a goldfish breathing, and not a single word could be heard. The noise drowned out the voice. Another round of applause led to a Miss Beiping, speaking in a crisp Northern accent, leading a child to introduce him to the audience: "This is Mr. Cai Yuanpei's son, Mr. Cai XX. He is very smart. Today, we have invited him to give a speech." The lights on both sides shone on his little face, making him look even more adorable. However, he just opened his mouth, bowed, and retreated, probably a little shy, right? There were also two children with red clothes and apple-shaped faces, the daughters of Mr. Pan Yangyao, who served as the mayor of the National Products Company Children's Market, the important people of the Children's Market! The photographer was very busy.</p>
<p>Miss Beiping announced the proposals: 1. Relief for street children; 2. Establishment of nurseries; 3. ... The applause ended this report.</p>
<p>The essay award ceremony began. Mr. Nie Zengjifen and Mr. Pan Yangyao presented the awards. There were sixty-two winners from the university and high school divisions. Because of the lack of time, only the top five were awarded at the time. The remaining winners were invited to the backstage. Sixth, yes, I remember I was sixth, so I went to the backstage and received a red envelope that looked like an invitation. The five words "Ms. Shen Airong" were neatly written in the middle.</p>
<p>The entertainment began. The first program was a singing performance by the Shanghai Guangci Hospital Boy Scouts. What heroic children, what agile and neat movements! Who says China is a sick man of Asia? But, how great it would be if all the children in the country had this strong physique and enterprising spirit. Otherwise, local development will not be very effective.</p>
<p>It was already four o'clock. Although there were still many wonderful programs to come, I had a little matter to attend to, so I had to say goodbye to these many adorable children and this children's land, and left the gate of the Lakeside Society.</p>

<p>This game can be used as an experiment in physics for [thermal expansion and contraction]. Readers, if you have free time, you may want to try it.</p>
<p>Buy a chicken egg or duck egg, immerse it in a pot of hot water to make the egg white slightly harden, and then remove the shell. On the other hand, take a small-necked bottle, the mouth of which must be slightly smaller than the egg, and then take a few pieces of paper, light them on fire, and throw them into the bottle. The air in the bottle expands due to heat, and a part of it escapes from the mouth of the bottle. While the fire is still burning, place the shelled egg at the mouth of the bottle. The air in the bottle is thin, and the pressure of the outside air presses against the mouth of the bottle. When the fire goes out, the air in the bottle cools and shrinks in volume. The outside air has no choice but to enter the bottle, but because the egg is blocking it, the air outside the bottle presses on the egg, and the air inside the bottle is weak. The egg has no choice but to fall into the bottle with a bang.</p>
<p>Before playing, we should find a bottle with a small neck and a large bottom, because the volume of the bottle is larger, the volume of air in the bottle can also be larger, and it will be easier to do.</p>

<h3>No Way Out</h3>
<p>— Jianshe</p>
<p>I am a person in the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie. Although that's what I say, life is urgently threatening me. From my family environment, I have to solve my life problems, but life problems are so difficult to solve. What should I do?</p>
<p>I want to find a reliable and legitimate job no matter what. But finding a job is so difficult and unfamiliar. I now feel like I am walking in a deep forest. How can I find my way out?</p>
<p>Some people always agree with me becoming a teacher. I have also worked as a teacher. I feel that if there is no other better path, this is also a good path. Because the life of a teacher is often close to books. Being able to constantly wash myself in knowledge, I will surely be able to obtain many opportunities for tempering and benefits from this washing. But how can I find a satisfactory teaching position? The educational circles everywhere are full of factions. Those who are in their faction can get in, but those who are not in their faction will be excluded by any means. Moreover, general principals are the least trusting of us young people. They all think that the old are good, their knowledge is profound, and their experience is rich, while young people are all useless waste. Even if they have some knowledge, it is only superficial. And it is fundamentally dangerous, maybe they will carry out some kind of [sex] propaganda in the first class. So, they feel a headache as soon as they see us young people. How can we gain their trust in this way?</p>
<p>It is difficult to become a teacher, so some people advise me to enter politics. Although I am unwilling to engage in political activities, I cannot say anything for the sake of life problems. So I thought about it too. But the political world is even more a matter of powerful families and personal connections. The first point is that factions are very strict. Under the big faction, there are small factions. Within the small faction, there are those who are the most trusted and those who are the next most trusted. If you did not have a close relationship with them in the first place, then even if you sell yourself and seek refuge, you will not be able to join that organization. The second point is that even for the smallest clerk, a big figure must recommend him. Without a big figure to speak for you, you cannot even find a doorman.</p>
<p>So some people want me to join the military. They say that this is quite suitable for me. Because in there, as long as you endure hardship and are willing to give up your life, you will have a chance to stand out. Standing out is indeed needed, but who is this life given to? I am very hesitant. And the threat of life is so terrible. But this is also a useless attempt! The military is the same as the political world. Powerful families are very strict. Without a close and long-term connection with them, you cannot get in no matter what.</p>
<p>So, according to the general saying, the paths that intellectuals can take are all blocked. Because I have no commercial knowledge, I naturally cannot get into commercial organizations. Born without literary genius, I cannot beg for food from bookstores and magazines and newspapers. But my life problems always have to be solved! But how should I solve them?</p>
<h3>Lost Peace of Mind</h3>
<p>— Jianshe</p>
<p>I have recently gradually developed a feeling of ____. I have learned that life is so alienated and cold, so I am becoming tired of life. At first, when I suffered from this ____, I could still maintain my daily routine. Now, this attack has become deeper and heavier, causing me to gradually abandon the rules of daily life. I feel that everything is gloomy, and I am becoming tired of everything.</p>
<p>In the past, I felt that philosophy was the most approachable. I was very willing to wander in the labyrinth of philosophy day and night, allowing those profound maxims to deeply intoxicate me. I remember there was a time when I desperately read Nietzsche. I felt that he was an incredible hero, and his powerful words of the Superman theory seemed like an alarm bell to awaken the world. Later, I read Hegel, and I also felt that he was a great man who surpassed the past and the present. I lingered between his theories of the state, and I felt that the soul of Germany was grasped by him. Then I became tired, and I unreasonably gave them up. I never read them again. Why is this? I can't say clearly. I only feel that my heart can no longer be so stable, no longer stably following the writing of these great philosophers, and being introduced into their profound mysteries. Not only that, I simply get upset when I see them.</p>
<p>Following this, I started reading novels like a madman. I read an unusually large number of novels. I often wanted to finish a story so much that I forgot to eat and forgot to sleep. I sympathized greatly with the heroine. I felt that a girl who won a love was as if I was also participating in that victory. Sometimes, when a story ended tragically, I felt like I had received a blow to my heart, and I was overwhelmed with sadness. From classical, romantic, to various new works now. For a while, my mind was full of yearnings for various stories: and many times I seemed to be living in that novel, I forgot all the circumstances of this reality. At that time, I was secretly and uncontrollably pleased. Because although I lost my interest in philosophy, I have now gained a new home. But now! : : : I don't want to read any novels. I no longer feel that the sweet story can tempt me: I no longer feel that the situation is worth my lingering. My mind is extraordinarily gloomy. I feel that all efforts are meaningless.</p>
<p>During this time, I also asked myself whether I had lost my health, and whether the weakness of my body was affecting my mood? But my body is still strong, it will not affect my mood, only my mood affects it. So I became upset. I can't find the reason for this upset, I'm just upset. I also feel that everything is empty, everything is indifferent, the world will not understand me, and I am too lazy to understand others. Life is only prolonged in a dying state. I am extremely decadent.</p>
<p>Where am I going? Can I still find my peace of mind? Alas, how panicked I am! How painful I am!</p>

<h3>Biography of a Celebrity</h3>
<h3>Marconi, Inventor of Wireless Radio (1)</h3>
<p>— Sen Ran</p>
<p>Among all the great inventions of modern times, wireless radio occupies a very important position. If the emergence of trains, ships, and airplanes shortened the distance of space, then, because of the invention of wireless radio, the distance of space has been completely broken down. With wireless radio, we can sit in Shanghai and hear the speeches of politicians in London and the songs of girls in New York; with wireless radio, generals can sit at home and command millions of land, sea, and air forces, and speculators can sit in Shanghai and know the situation of the New York Stock Exchange. If you are happy, you can stay in Shanghai and ask a photography studio in Berlin to take an artistic photo of you, and you can also use wireless radio to achieve your goal. The invention of wireless radio has brought together the mainland, the ocean, and the space, in short, the entire space. From this, commerce, military affairs, politics, and even the entire life of mankind have gained great convenience.</p>
<p>But who exactly is the inventor of wireless radio? This is Marconi (Guglielmo Marconi) we are going to talk about.</p>
<p>Marconi was born on April 25, 1874, in the village of Griffen near Bologna, Italy. His father was an Italian landowner, and his mother came from a distinguished Irish family. Therefore, he lived a very comfortable life from an early age, and poverty and suffering had little to do with him.</p>
<p>Because of his good family environment, Marconi's education was naturally solved according to his wishes. At the age of fifteen, he entered the University of Bologna, where he was often guided by Augusto Righi, a famous physicist in Italy at the time.</p>
<p>Marconi was certainly a gifted person. He was very diligent since he was a child, and he had a special love for natural science. When he was still a twelve-year-old boy, Dr. Heinrich Hertz had already begun his famous experiment, which undoubtedly had a great influence on the clever Marconi who especially loved natural science. After reading Hertz's experimental report, he immediately had a feeling: it is possible to communicate without electric wires!</p>
<p>Hertz's experiment increased Marconi's interest in electrical research. At the same time, Professor Righi was also working hard on the research of [Hertzian waves], which undoubtedly had an even greater relationship with Marconi. Because of his intelligence, diligence, and love of electrical research, Professor Righi also liked him very much. He not only received many valuable lessons from this famous physics professor, but also received many practical benefits. In guiding Marconi's research, Professor Righi lent him all his wireless equipment, such as arc generators, etc., and encouraged him to work hard on the invention of wireless radio. As a result, Marconi made up his mind to study wireless radio. At this time, he was still a twenty-two-year-old youth.</p>
<p>Initially, he began experimenting in the yard of his hometown. He first erected a bamboo pole in one corner, and then erected another bamboo pole in another corner, and then connected what is today called a Radiator (wireless radio transmission and reception line) to the poles erected in these two corners, and then hung a Blik can at the upper end of the Radiator to work hard on his work. This method, in the eyes of the villagers, was of course very strange and laughable. However, Marconi did not pay any attention to people's ridicule, but just worked hard to do his [wonderful] things. In this way, day after day, Marconi achieved his first success. If he hung the Blik can about six feet above the ground, he could transmit signals a distance of 100 yards; if he raised the Blik can to 14 feet, he could transmit signals a distance of about 300 yards. As a result, he experimented and found that if he increased the amount (electrical capacity) of the Blik can and its height of suspension, he could achieve communication of 1.5 miles.</p>
<p>Marconi once asked the following question in Righi's laboratory: How to increase the sensing distance of electric waves? Righi's answer to this question was: [Raise your vibrator and see]. This was a great inspiration for Marconi's research. His initial success was achieved under this inspiration, in his efforts to study the relationship between the height of the Radiator and the communication distance.</p>
<p>In order to widely publish the results of his research, Marconi wrote a letter to Sir W.H. Preece, the chief engineer of the British Post Office at the time.</p>
<p>At that time, Preece was also researching his wireless telegraph, and he had made considerable achievements. But after reading Marconi's research, he felt that this Italian youth was even more brilliant than himself. He immediately wrote a very detailed reply to discuss the issue of wireless radio with Marconi, and at the same time wrote the following words at the end of the letter: [......If it does not hinder you, then please come to England no matter what. Regarding your invention, we will seek as many conveniences as possible.] (To be continued)</p>
