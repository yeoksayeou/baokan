<p>時評</p>
<h3>政府借麥之處置</h3>
<p>前日報載全國經濟委員會某員稱。該會據滬麵粉商呈述政府購運麵粉損害國人自營粉業交負責各員審查結果。認有相當理由。亦主不必購粉云云。查此次政府五千萬金元借欵。其性質與向來的一般借欵不同。因此次所借。並非現欵。而由政府先在美國購買美棉美麥。由美國金融復興公司墊付貨價。美棉以四千萬元爲限。美麥以一千萬元爲限。吾政府須待購得之棉麥。運至本國出售。然後才得現欵。此其所以與一般借欵不同也。</p>
<p>論者毎謂以今日政府地位。銷售大宗外棉外麥於國内。得毋損害本國農村經濟乎。然而汪院長已一再引證海關統計數字。認爲國産棉麥本不足用。進口已屬必要可無損於農村。且此五千萬金元借欵。將全部交由全國經濟委員會支配。由該會通盤籌劃。作全國建設與復興農村之用。故反可有利於農村。夫以吾匣之窮。軍費政費。尙無辦法安有餘力以資建設。更安有餘信可以借到不損主權之外債。今政府竟能借得五千萬元以事建設。則豈不爲吾人所歡迎乎。然就另一方面以論美粉。如經委會專員所審定。認爲不必購買。其言亦有至理凡少具常識之人。寗有異言。不過所謂不必購買者。又豈政府在合同條約之下可以自由哉。查政府於十二月十六日公佈之米麥粉進口税率。粉税乃倍於麥税。具見政府維護本國粉業之忱。更聞政府對此次粉廠請願免税代表。曾建議以粉廠承銷政府所購美粉爲免税條件。此説而確。廠方同意與否。姑且不論卽使同意。亦非根本解决之道。蓋廠方如若承銷美粉則粉廠轉而爲銷售商。勢必影響於廠内工作。且洋粉充斥於市。轉瞬六月。新麥登塲。將有何人顧問。此爲代銷美粉之粉廠所顧慮。亦卽復興農村之政府不可不計及者也。</p>
<p>在此雙方爲難之情勢下。而想到建設上去。則吾人敢建議於政府曰。此不得不購之美粉。不必求售於市塲。以換取現金。而可仿行二十一所水災後政府借美麥粉以工代賑之辦法。爲開發西北及賑濟河南等地水旱兵災之用。東北淪亡之後。人民與政府一致提倡開發西北。今經委會之西北辦事處已成立。開發計劃實施之時。舉凡築路𤃒河之伕役人等。無不可給予麵粉以代�</p>
<p>工資現金。西北連年苦旱。糧食缺乏。人民早失其購買力。政府以美麥濟之。與國内粉廠之營業。不相衝突也。其他災荒之區。莫不可以以工代賑之法行之。卽在江南。人民雖習於米食。政府對築路造堤之工人。亦可扣除其一部分工資而供以麵食。此乃爲建設着想。强迫一部份人改換食品。亦有減少洋米消耗之效力。而無與國粉業競爭之矛盾。方今國内民窮財盡。借得一物一錢。當作十物十錢之用。自購美麥以至於實施建設其間經營自應十分經濟。今美粉之價。一般的較國人自製者爲昻。而求售於國内市塲。勢不得不較國内自製者爲廉。現在西北及其他災區糧價旣較其他各地爲高。則工資亦應較高。政府如以購粉變價。再行支撥工資。其間須遭受兩重損失。是豈經濟之道乎。若以所購之粉。直接運送至工作地點。以爲給養。則旣可免上述之損失。及可免損害國人自營之粉業。並可省出售時經紀人之佣金。省得一分旣可以多做一分之建設。不可謂爲非計也。其尤要者。爲麵粉之運輸。可間接增助人民之生計。自起運以至終點。其間國營之鐵道輪船駁運業船户掮夫等。亦莫不沾受其惠。二十一年水災之後。百業凋零。貨運停頓。設非水災委員會以工代賑運儲麥粉。以麥粉代工資。則沿江各地。不知有若干萬民船。被劈爲薪料。若干萬工人。淪亡爲盜匪矣。其於人民生計。亦甚有應響也。</p>
<p>吾人對於美麥之經營。亦有不能已於言者。近日外傅美麥。將委由五進口洋行代爲兜銷於國内粉廠之説。夫以中國當局與中國人民交易。乃必勞洋商爲其居間人。竊疑其説之不確。而言者則謂若不由洋商兜銷。則廠商知爲政府之麥。卽將過抑其價。故不得不然。廠商則另有其説焉。吾人以爲國家建設大事。人民應與政府合作。廠商應有一種組織。組織之份子。應嚴守信約。除政府之麥外。非因攙和用必要者。不得向洋行另購洋麥。並按廠胃大小。需要緩急製成通盤預算。交由政府參照逐次在美進購。政府方面。應將買價公開。照本售予各廠。除運費保險費利息開支等項外。不得另謀利益。一若政府爲各廠之定貨代理人者然。惟買進旣有先後。價目自有不同。各廠領受之麥。如慮因進價不同而引起糾紛。則可取一定時期内之平均成本爲售價。至於貨欵保護。當如通行之商例辦理。辦法正多。奚必洋商而後可。哉願政府與粉廠共謀之也。</p>

<h3>世界大戰恐慌向瑞士襲來　列·山·　（歐洲通訊）</h3>
<p>｜瑞士的民兵制度値得注意｜</p>
<p>無論希特勒的和平演説怎様的動人、無論法國人如何的高唱安全保障、希望歐洲平安無事、無論英國怎様恐懼戰爭到來的危險、無論莫索列尼如何轉變方向、以和平使者的責任來斡旋歐洲局面、但這一切舉動、却總蒙蔽不住一種鐵一様的事實、就是歐洲戰爭爆發、仍只是時間問題、那些門面話、粉刷和平的行動、只可以證明大家凖備尙未充分、一時不肯動手、蓄精待銳的景象、好戲就要在後頭了、</p>
<p>上一次歐戰、瑞士得獨免於難、在瑞士一般人看來、這是一宗再憢倖也没有的事情、目前大家的預感就不同了、顯然此次未來的戰爭、瑞士就將無法中立、事泰乎、事楚乎、瑞士必須於德法二者間擇一而行、因之一班軍事職業家與軍事有關的各種工業資本家·及法國的政治家等、暗中就推波助瀾、使事態擴大、使民間對於戰爭的觀念、愈加强度化、特别是今年下半年來、報紙上就屢次宣傳德軍事參謀本部、有對法戰爭時取道瑞士的計劃、本已一時鬧得滿城風雨、加之後來在德瑞交界處、德國國社黨衝鋒隊、又與瑞士守境兵士發生衝突、這一來就無異火上添油、係一種再好也没有的宣傳材料、一個中立的小國、國民是素常以和平主義相號召的、至此、就慢慢的被牽引戰神的座前去、</p>
<p>使歐洲局面重陷於緊張的狀態的、自然是希特勒、他主張一切德意志民族圑結起來、重歸於德國、瑞士的人口、德系佔百分之六十九、法系只佔百分之二十一、假如希特勒的主張實行、無異瑞士亦將歸併於德國、這不但法人覺得危險、瑞士人本身亦感不妙、另一方面、正如瑞士某報的論調、瑞士處在德意奧三個法西斯蒂大國間、歐洲風雲一起、瑞士就立於困難萬分的地位、上列種種理由的逼迫、除了加强武備以外、自然没有别的路好走、於是軍備預算就增加了、軍隊組織法又重新加以改良、使更加現代化、</p>
<p>瑞士雖是個只有四百萬人口的小國、但軍備方面、我們决没有看輕他的理由、他們自已也很淸楚、與其專靠正義公道來維持他的中立、倒不如多凖備些實力、也許效力會更大一點、直至目前止瑞士的軍備、最少有下列的幾個優點、似乎還要超過列强各大國、㈠實行全國皆兵、極澈底的民兵制度、㈡兵士個人射擊術的優異、恐世界各國中無出其右、㈢此外化學戰爭的軍用品、瑞士亦有特長、倘有那個國家想侵略瑞士、來冒這個險、瑞士一定會立卽加以迎頭痛擊、勝負雖無把握、但絶不至於不抵抗、</p>
<p>瑞士並無正式的常備軍、所有的只是民兵、但在世界上、我們决不容易找出像瑞士這様做到「無民不兵」地步的第二個國家、並且不單在技術方面、有着精美的成績、就在軍隊道德方面、也有一種很深入的敎育、瑞士一般人民｜也就是兵士的觀念、保護自已的國家、並維持瑞士的中立、這幾乎變成了瑞士的國民性了、瑞士民兵的基礎就組織在這一點上面、</p>
<p>瑞士的一般人民、與其説他們是過的各種職業生活、倒不如説他們是過的軍隊生活、每個人民都有一枝步槍、全套軍服、並其他種　戰爭需用品、這些全部用具、均允許各人帶回家裏去保存的、每個星期日、就在最小的村落、也都有靶子塲、幾乎所有的年靑人都來參加練習射擊、</p>
<p>這靶子塲是屬於那地方公有、但同時也受軍部的管轄、這是説步兵的情形、騎兵呢、則除了全副武裝外、還有馬匹、大部分農民還可以利用這馬匹來工作農事、不過須注意保護、因爲每年都有騎兵隊長來擔任檢查的工作、他們的武器·馬匹·並射擊練習的成績、平常都須記載在簿子上、以備查考、</p>
<p>瑞士人口、共計四百十萬强、戰時大約可以出兵五十萬、這種軍隊、依年齡的組織、可以分爲三種、從二十歲至二十九歲的壯丁、加入砲兵隊、從二十歲至三十二歲的壯丁、加入步兵隊、兩共可以抽出二十二萬人、後備隊從三十歲或三十三歲起至四十歲止、可以逹十一萬人以上、從四十一歲至四十八歲年紀的人、組成國民軍、大約也有十萬人左右、其他如在後方服役的救護隊·運輸隊·等等、也可徵集十五萬人的數目、並且瑞士國境狹窄、交通便利、一朝有事、只在數小時内、卽可以全部動員集中、最近更竭力擴充新式軍備、特别注意航空計劃、不久當能全部實現、屆時當然戰鬭力更加堅强、瑞士軍隊數目、雖然不多、戰鬭能力與大國相比較、耐久力自然較差、但敵人如想在短期間内侵入瑞士境内、恐非有極大的犠牲不可、此外另一理由、瑞士境内多山、居高臨下、守易攻難、地理上也佔着便宜不少、</p>
<p>瑞士的軍人服役期間、普通兵士二十九年、軍官三十二年、新兵訓練規定、每個靑年一逹二十歲時、卽須受軍事敎育、在新兵學校中、步兵受六十五日的訓練、騎兵連同騎馬術九十日、砲兵並飛行隊七十五日、如新計劃施行、大約這時間將更延長、每年新兵學生、平常有二萬五千人、除了這正式的訓練外、他們平常的訓練、一年中幾乎没有停止、特别是對於飛行員與砲兵的訓練、此外在聯邦政府及各州政府補助之下、尙有種種副軍事敎育、例如瑞士運動總會、毎年就支出四十五萬瑞士佛郎來訓練二萬五千個靑年作跑雪運動、又如射擊總會、每年訓練一萬個十六歲的靑年練習射擊、每個靑年射擊員、毎年可分得五個瑞士佛郎同五十顆子彈、還有在下級幹部步兵聯合會主持之下、每年舉行一次全瑞士射擊比賽會、這中間自然鼓勵並培養出不少人才來、但最重要的、還是平時他們的生活、已與軍營中生活連成一片、每星期日的練習射擊、在瑞士人看來、似乎並不是一種工作、而是一種游戲或娛樂、他們自已本身、已經没有練習射擊就是軍人的感覺、這因爲長久的歷史關係、漸漸使他們覺得自已的行爲出於自然、變成習慣的了、加以毎一星期或數星期總舉行一次演習戰、就將他們在新兵學校中所學得的戰術、加以溫習、使戰爭的智識愈加精進、</p>
<p>在我們東方人看來、瑞士卽是怎麽小的一個國家、而且又是永久中立國、自然人民應該除了口裏説和平外、要連槍桿也拿不動才對、然而事實上並不然、他們不獨不向人家摇尾乞憐、希望得到苟安、而是更進一步、充分凖備着給予野心家嘗試時一個打擊、這才是武裝和平、我們不管他瑞士如何受環境的逼迫、不得不走上了一條道路、但所表現出來的事實、在武裝中維持和平、這確値得我們的猛省、</p>
<p>世界大約不會從此太平了、以前大家以爲美國能够永遠千秋、目前怎様、西方唯</p>
<p>一安全的國家瑞士、現又在驚濤駭浪中了、我們倒要替中國的一班要人們擔心、一旦危機襲來、將逃到那裏去呢、</p>
<p>目前世界上並没有一片凈土、這倒確實成了問題、一九三三·十二·十四·歐陸</p>

<h3>來滬避難者稱閩垣恐慌狀况</h3>
<p>人民避難：：市面蕭條</p>
<p>閩中戰事、自中央軍收復延平後、福州人心、極度不安、昨日、怡和洋行捷升輪、自閩來滬、旅客特多、本報記者、特向該輪旅客、叩訽閩中近狀、據稱人心皇皇、不可終日、而市面更蕭條不堪矣、</p>
<h3>人心極度不安</h3>
<p>閩方對於前方戰事、諱莫如深、故人民均不得知、自中央軍占領延平、閩軍在前綫戰敗後、福州城防、前數日突然緊張、捷升輪開離閩境時、福州四郊、已有防禦工作、沿城布鐵絲網沙袋等、及障碍物、一到下午六時後、城内燈火全息、商店已無夜市、故人民對此、均發生重大恐慌、在閩日僑、陸續向南台遷避、</p>
<h3>居民四處逃避</h3>
<p>閩垣居民、富有者早於一個月前、逃往香港上海避難、自當局禁止民衆遷搬、出境者須由公安局給證後、居民格外恐慌、故中下階級、近亦紛紛遠避、惟恐當局干涉、故多數避往厦門、再由厦門轉赴各地、其未離閩者、類皆無力遠行之人、</p>
<p>[P市竟慘淡不堪&gt;</p>
<p>福州兩個月來、商運俱滯、各業貿易、幾全停頓、因進出口貨、故海關已無税收、當局於上月曾電請各處輪公司、恢復福州航路、並請華輪改掛外旗、結果、華商輪船、無一開往、以致財政上恐慌、逹於極度、</p>
<h3>外輪獲利堪巨</h3>
<p>在此兩月餘滬閩綫内、祗有英商怡和洋行捷升一輪行駛、日商大阪公司、雖有三船、但毎日祇航一艘、故以捷升營業最佳、毎次來滬、旅客滿船、向來統艙舖位、毎人祇售六七人、今已陸續漲至五十餘元、一帆布床舖位、亦需四十餘元、並須情商、遲恐爲他人購去、該輪買辦鄧某、向來毎次虧折、自閩變發生後、客脚收入、較前頓增十餘倍、毎䠀可餘一二萬兩、兩個餘月買辦、已造成一富翁矣、怡和爲包繳制、比較上亦已增加、近來船往閩江、進口時輒由海軍檢查、</p>
<h3>捷升輪中難民</h3>
<p>捷升輪上次往來滬閩、進出口貨均缺、本班來滬、由閩運至水菒等項、又告滿船、至於上海裝往福州之出口貨、亦突然增多、約有三四百噸、中以民食需要之麥粉與疋頭等項居多、今次乘捷升來滬之避難閩人、共有四百多人、</p>

<h3>蘇炳文氏談話</h3>
<p>此次來滬會晤舊部</p>
<p>馬占山赴美非事實</p>

<h3>會晤舊部</h3>
<p>據蘇氏談、本人自卜居蘇城後、終日閉户寫讀、對於外間事務、未能明悉、此次來滬、並無任務、因本人昔日在東北抗日時之舊部將領、現在散居滬上、另謀生計者、頗有人在、睽隔忽已數月、故特來滬會晤、昨已一一晤見、並因張學良方自歐遊返國抵滬、故特往晋謁、因各界往謁者甚多、未曾多談、對於張氏之今後行動職位等、未及一一詢問、本人在滬再作數日勾留、卽將返蘇、</p>
<h3>馬李近况</h3>
<p>記者繼詢以津電傳稱、馬占山將軍最近有將請求政府撥欵三萬元赴美考察云云、是否屬實、據談、本人近與馬將軍久疏音信、其近况若何、未能明悉、惟悉渡美考察一節、恐非事實、至於李杜將軍、自廬山返滬後、迄今未離滬寸步、腦病尙未痊愈、蘇氏未謂、本人舊部、前自東北經俄退人新疆之鄭潤成部一旅、現駐迪化、其駐地在盛部轄境内、當與省方接近、因新疆地處邊陲、交通不便、通訊艱難、最近實况、無從得悉云、</p>

<h3>中央軍討閩勝利後招商局正式接收兩海輪</h3>
<p>海祥海瑞改懸局旗</p>
<p>招商局因營業發逹、輪船不敷分配、故有新建江海船七艘之舉、當前任郭外峯時代、曾購　那威海輪兩艘、分派於南北洋航路中、惟因船價未淸、致久不能接管、迨至劉鴻生任事後、以發展業務、缺乏噸位、先將該船價付淸、茲已正式接收、卽日呈報海關、改正船名、換懸局旗、並派入南北洋綫開航、殊有記載之價値也、</p>
<h3>挪威兩輪</h3>
<p>海瑞原名Beutem、一千八百五十噸、海祥原名Bentik、一千八百五十二噸、各畏二百六十一英尺、均爲挪威商輪、民國二十一年、郭外峯任内、向挪威航商購得、船價聞爲一萬六千鎊、議定分期交付、船舶先由局内使用、須俟船價淸償、始可歸局内接收、故兩年來、該二輪雖派航各綫、仍懸挪威國旗、</p>
<h3>船價付淸</h3>
<p>去年十一月内、因隴海路聯運成功、局方初擬派該二輪行駛老窑、故劉鴻生卽將兩船最後一期應付船價付淸、凖備由局正式接管、派充海州聯運班、嗣因水尺關係、改調同華等船行老窑、而將海瑞海祥仍駛靑島港粤綫、當船價交付後、本定上年十二月内接收、改名易旗、又因閩變發生、復又展緩、至於今日、</p>
<h3>正式接客</h3>
<p>閩變發生後、該二輪因掛挪威旗號、行駛厦門等處、較爲穩妥、故將接收日期、延至今日、近因中央軍討閩勝利、商輪行駛、不生問題、故該局内决將兩輪正式收管、早日派准航路、茲已由局開具船名「海瑞HaeJui」「海祥HaeHsiang」噸量·長度·艙口·機件·輪數·甲板·及建造年期·（係一九一八年在美國造）等、呈報交通部航政局江海關等處註册登記、並請領船牌、呈文卽日送出、以便撤去挪威旗、改掛本局旗云、</p>
<h3>派定航路</h3>
<p>兩新輪純係貨船、並無客位、局内已經議定、於接收後、以靑島往南華一路、貨運最多、仍令該二輪開航該綫、而以無恙·鯤興·兩船、代替行駛海州之老窑、並將同華輪替出、改駛天津班、嘉禾輪暫走長江一路、使船無空舶、貨可運裝、</p>

<h3>今日發表談話</h3>
<p>張氏原訂於昨午發表一書面談話、詳述遊歐經過、及歸國感想、嗣以前晚應酬過忙、入午後方獲休息、乃不及親自起草、昨派米春霖氏、通知往訪各記者、該項書面談話、凖改明午（卽今午）十（二時發表、並據米氏云、張氏在滬尙有數日勾留、最近恐不致離滬、渠或將屆四中全會入京、但亦未作决定、惟視中央曁各方面情形而定云云、</p>

<p>日謀壟斷東半球漁業</p>
<h3>我國領海漁權將被侵奪</h3>
<p>昨據國際貿易局指導處發表、據國外情報選編載稱、日本農林省水産局、對於擴張海外漁業之計劃、昨今兩年、（卽昭和七八兩年）投下三十萬元、在中國南海乃至南洋一帶、爲大規模之南方漁塲調查、發見無數之新漁塲、得極大之成功、該局以有此經騐、擬更擴充爲廣範圍之海外漁塲調查、同時採取全部的奪取海外漁業政策、爲根本之改組、明年度預算、增爲百四十六萬元、已經農林省會議决定、近日正向大藏省開始折衝、據云、此項海外漁業政策改訂案、並含北洋漁業前途根據地計劃在内、竟擬飛躍擴張及于東半球海洋之全面、開日本水産史上空前之局勢、此項舉措、不特爲漁業之發展、同時並企圖對其海軍在太平洋作戰上爲有力之援助、殊値注意、茲將其計劃案之梗概略述如左、</p>
<h3>東半球漁塲之調查</h3>
<p>向來日本政府之水産試騐所、並未備有漁塲調查船隻、現在擬投下九十萬元、建造一千噸之漁塲調查船、以備向中國南海·南冰洋·印度洋·太平洋·之全面、尋覔新漁塲、至明年度之五十餘萬元所獲新漁塲、則專注重於太平洋方面、使所出動之漁船、兼任偵察海面之責、造成有力之情報網絡、以備一旦有事之際、對太平洋作戰、爲有力之援助、至於南極方面、鯨羣素稱有名、所獲必多、此外魚類以及其他大量漁獲之物、均由水産試騐所研究利用處分之方、</p>
<h3>北洋漁業新造監船</h3>
<p>由海軍撥出一千噸級以特務艦及驅逐艦、改之爲北洋漁業監視船、裝代向來所用之金鵄丸、並預定第一年度預算爲三十五萬元、第二年度兼設備艦載飛行機、以資監視及調查魚羣之用、蓋因現在所有監視船之祥鳳丸·白鴻丸·俊鷹丸·等監視漁船、感覺不敷應用、擬再新造百噸及六十噸二隻、預算爲三十七萬元、</p>
<h3>整理漁塲業已着手</h3>
<p>因爲現在漁塲漁區、錯綜不齊、漁業權分爭不絶、擬爲有統制之整理統一、以指導經濟之開發、謀漁村經濟之更生、特由農林省及府縣、特派指導、專司其事、預算二十四萬元、此外則設置北洋漁業之前進根據地、爲五個年之計劃、共計用費一千六百萬元、（第一年三百三十萬元）業已着手準備、其根據地點、大概爲幌筵島·摺鉢灣·地方、此項根據地案、爲海洋漁業擴大計、劃重要之一部分、特以預算關係、暫行保留决定云、據上所述、若一一實現、則中國領海範圍内之漁業權、必多受侵奪、殆屬無疑、是亦宜早爲注意者也、</p>

<h3>押匯與貨運　鄭·寳·照·</h3>
<p>｜銀行與鐵路合作之良機｜</p>
<p>鐵路辦理貨運業務、其目的在流通商貨、扶助社會經濟之發展、吾國鐵路、多屬國有國營、對於貨運業務、尤應以服務社會爲本旨、較諸客運之應便利行旅、使命尤爲重大、良以一國之貧富强弱、往往基於農工商業之興衰隆替、而農工商業之資周轉流通者、則爲貨物、故貨運不便利卽農工商業不能發展之要因、農工商業不發展、則國家自不能由貧致富、由弱轉强、觀乎東西各國鐵路運貨之廉捷與繁榮、卽足知其富强之由來、其使命之大、固未可以等閒視之也、</p>
<p>國營鐵路之經營其業務也、目的不在求利、故凡能便利社會之各種業務、利益甚薄或竟無利可圖者、亦應優爲之、曩時吾國鐵路雖屬國營、但對於服務社會一端、究多漠然置之、故往往未能深入民間、爲民衆謀便利、就貨運一端而言、商民每感不便、深以爲苦、於是中間人應運而生、人皆寗出不必出之代價、以求得一種應得之便利、推原其故、皆由於鐵咱對於營業方針、未有正確之觀念、以爲鐵路運輸大都係獨占性質、無論如何不便、如何昻貴、商旅必舍此而無他途、凡足以便利社會之處、皆認爲畫蛇添足、與鐵路之營業無關、庸詎知鐵路營業之本旨、不在僅求自身之利益乎、</p>
<p>乃者、鐵路當局鑒於過去營業方針之謬誤、亟思有惟以深入社會、爲商旅謀幸福、求便利輕負担、不以自身之利益爲前提、而以社會之利益爲依歸、最近各路創設鐵路營業所、代客辦理一切客貨運輸手續、意卽在此、營業所純爲鐵路自辦之服務機關、亦卽鐵路營業之對外代表、一切服務社會爲宗旨、不以誅求利潤爲職責、且能深入農工商業各界爲商旅解决一切運輸問題、免除其痛苦减輕其負担、一掃以前閉門營業自大自尊之惡習、此則鐵路營業上最近之革新也、</p>
<p>就發貨運言、鐵路營業所已能代客接送貨物、代辦一切貨運手續、隨時答復各界關於貨運價章之問訊、並能就能力之所及、竭力爲客商解决各種貨運困難問題、社會稱便、已著成效、惟鐵路辦理貨運、旨在流通商貨、上旣言之矣、而流通商貨之方法、除運輸利便外、尙有待於運輸金融之圓活、蓋商貨由甲地運送至乙地、卽爲買賣交易之形成、交易之結果、卽爲貨欵之淸算、淸算貨欵之方法不一、㈠有由買主携現往購者、㈡有由買主持票貼現往購者、㈢有由賣主於買賣未成之前、先行匯欵者、㈣有由賣主於買賣旣成之後、始行解欵者、凡此皆須先交欵而後購貨、或先交貨而後收欵、或於買主爲不便、或於賣主爲不利、其能雙方兼顧並利者、厥惟押匯之一法、雖買賣雙方不相識者、亦能藉押匯方法、完成其交易、此圓活運輸金融之善法也、鐵路果欲完成其流通商貨、扶助社會經濟發展之使命、非於便利運輸之外、兼行恊助運輸金融之圓活不可、否則必有多數之貨運、因此而莫由發展也、</p>
<p>鐵路旣已創辦營業所、作服務社會之前驅矣、今後欲求其能在貨運方面盡服務社會之能事、非辦理押匯、以調劑運輸金融不可、雖然押匯一事、乃銀地重要業務之一、鐵路營業所、如欲從事押匯、尙須得銀行業之援助、而後乃能進展、故銀行事業之本旨、亦在服務社會、便利民衆、與鐵路正復相同、銀行業者亦應有深社會之毅力與粗精神、作眞正之投資、而後乃能逹扶助生産之目的、吾謂押匯一端、乃銀行與鐵路合作之莫大良機、鐵路有營業所、辦理一切貨運手續、卽可直接與銀行辦理押匯、以應農工商業之需要、其法至簡、卽凡遇客商託由鐵路營業所代運</p>
<p>之貨物、如需押匯、卽由營業所向貨站開做提貨單、（提貨單與貨運收據有别、前者可以轉讓、可以押欵、後者照章不得轉押、）以押匯銀行之名、塡入提貨單收貨人名欄内、將提貨單轉交辦理押匯之銀行、取得押欵、轉交託運人、其法簡而其效大、誠銀行與鐵路應辦之新興業務也、</p>
<p>鐵路旣以深入社會服務、不求自身利益、爲改</p>
<p>進之努力矣、吾望銀行業亦本此精神、迅與鐵路合作、以圖共榮、合作之道、可自上述之押匯辦法始、質諸金融業諸公、不知以爲何如、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>我們所需要的</h3>
<p>「讀書指導」（一）</p>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>我非常高興在中國圖書館中居然會有「讀書指導」的創設，這確是一件很有敎育意義的事、你們的成功一定可以超過學校敎育。因爲聚集在一間學校裏的並不餐得都是業於讀書有興趣的人，可是，湧到你們周圍的則不然，是爲了自已的興趣與需要，　一點不要强迫的一大羣知識荒的，嗷嗷待哺的災民。</p>
<p>看了這兩天的「讀書問答」，非常滿意，雖然所討論的還是一般的問題，但是這仍是很需要的、現在我來提出一個較實踐的，在貴部指導下的工作問題來。</p>
<p>我覺得你們的指導不應專用在書本上，尤不應敎人單去讀書本。因爲我想，目下接受貴部指導者，大約都是一面在爲生活掙扎，一面想學點什麽去應付實際生活的需要的人。如果你們憑着主觀之見，替他們開出一張堂皇的書目、寫上幾大册某某自學入門，高談學術的沿革和統系、這實在與大家無關，最高限度亦不過似胡適梁啓超輩替學生開出國學書目一般無二。這些山珍海味，祗在嚇人，欺人，並非「非</p>
<p>災民」所需的糧食也。</p>
<p>我意，你們指導的中心應注意目前讀者實踐生活，在各種日常生活中所發生的困難，切實的加以指示與援助其解决。因爲這是目的，指導讀書就變爲手段了。因此，我想，你們的工作簡直不應或不必像煞有介事的做得冠冕堂皇，却宜冷靜切實踐的，無聲無色的做云。你們時時要注意的是生活的指導，　不是塡鴨式的知識的灌輸，敎堂的經典的説敎。因此，你們介紹的書，不必有系統，講沿革，祗要能供解决某一問題，參考之用就滿够了，書目的簡單和缺乏系統是儘可不管，不要把書尊爲神聖，不要視讀書爲了不得的盛業；你們自已也不必或不要成爲書齋中的學究、這是我所希望的。能如此，你們的工作才不落空，大家纔需要你們，自然這是一件偉大的工程。</p>
<p>正因爲如此，前途的因難，恐怕比辦一間大學還難得多。不過，細讀讀你們的計劃，是與愚見有不謀而同的傾向。因此我非常愛護而不能已於言，希望你們更加注意，更具體的將你們工作方向示人，使大家澈底明瞭，以便互相督促，使這破天荒的事業做得更爲實際。</p>
<p>你們不要封鎖大家的意見，要誠意吸收各社會層生活的眞影，要具科學家解剖它的决心與細心，要具宗敎家的信心去求改變這不良的罪惡與獸性，同時更要具小學敎師的慇懃知忍耐與需要你們的人們相周旋。</p>
<p>你們成功和失敗是在你們了解大家的深淺；獲得同情的人們的贊助，全體讀者的合作與否。愚直之方聊供你們的參考。最後還希望這一問題也在「讀書問答」公開，引起大家研究。</p>

<h3>電話局擴充吳淞綫路</h3>
<p>龍華改裝自動機四月可竣工</p>
<p>華租通話日增將擴充接綫臺</p>
<p>交通部上海電話局、因吳淞綫路、不敷應用、决定加以擴充、至於龍華改裝自動機、及擴充○號接綫臺、拆除越界話機、將於本年夏季全部竣工、租界電話公司增設○四號人工臺、定二月十日竣工、兹探得詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>吳淞增綫</h3>
<p>吳淞裝有電話機之用户、共爲三十三家、所有電話、直接由江灣電話分局管轄、以該區市况、未見繁榮、故電話局自吳淞至江灣分局、僅敷設綫路三條、依理三條路綫、足供三十餘户之應用、惟因須轉輾接通、故時有延誤情事、該地各界、曾一再要求改裝增綫、電話局爲便利用户起見、决擴充綫路二條、二月中可竣工、</p>
<h3>龍華換機</h3>
<p>龍華方面、市面日見繁盛、電話用户、亦日有增加、該區電話局、本設有分局一所、所有話機、全屬交換機、且又陳舊、故電話局曾議訂改裝自動機、呈請交通部審核、業奉部令照准、並由交通部購料委員會向美國訂購新式自動機、三月間可來滬、全部供給龍華區域用户應用、四月中可拆裝竣工、</p>
<h3>浦東租費</h3>
<p>至於浦東方面電話、自上年十一月三十日由上海電話局根據電話臨時合約與電話公司交涉成立電話分局、歸由電話局接管後、卽規定價格、住宅毎架月租十元、商號毎架月租十五元、該區居民以電話局江灣·南市·閘北·眞茹·龍華·各處電話租費爲七元及十元、而浦東一方、同屬市區範圍、而定價高貴、故曾要求核减、電話局方面以水綫之故電話公司裝越界機時之收費、幾高出租界一倍、曾請示交部、部方主張仍照現價徵收、</p>
<h3>擴充零號</h3>
<p>電話局之「零號」接綫台、因自去年八月底取銷華租界五分通話費後、各區用户之打往租界者、幾增出一倍以上、而尤以中午十二時至下午二時之間、接往租界者、更形繁忙、幾有應接不暇之概、電話局爲此特呈准交部、由交部購料委員會出面、向备國訂購接綫台之機件、以備擴充華租通話之零號台、現該項貨品、將於五月間來滬、六月中卽可擴充零號接綫台、</p>
<h3>拆越界機</h3>
<p>上海電話公司裝於華界各地之二百八十八架越界話機、電話局自上年九月先後拆去三十架後、以機件不敷分配、故須待擴充後、方能全部拆除、上海電話公司以接往華界之零二號人工台、甚爲繁忙、故决另闢闢「零四」號人工台一具、專供租接往浦東者、（因浦東電話呌接租界者居多）現已動工設立、約二月十日可竣工、二十日可應用、特此台成立後、浦東越界機、卽割歸電話局處理、各處之越界機、則須電話局「零」號台擴充後、方能割淸、時間約在六月底、</p>

<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>對於「婦女國貨年」的展望</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>自從「婦女國貨年」的序幕啓露了後，我「婦女國貨」的呼聲，可以説彌漫了全國，雖然，在事實和成績上，我們還未見他們如何的設施可是，在外貨充斥，入超激增的現在，我們國貨前途，能有這樣一番熱烈的提倡，自然已是舉國共慶的一回事，</p>
<p>本來，一個國家的成立，是奠基於個人家庭，由家庭而社會，由社會而國家，當然，關於他的富强和衰貧，也就是繫於他國民經濟之良否，過去我國｜籠罩在帝國主義惡氛下的市塲狀况，自然，只有呈現着黑暗和紊亂，外貨傾銷，入超激增的狂濤，旣是一天天地氾濫，而農村破産，市面不景氣的暴風雨，也就掃蕩了全國，不過，在這種嚴重的敎訓下，年來我們的國貨事業，也得以約略抬頭，但外貨的充斥依然，國人的採用外貨，也依然，偉大的國貨年，終於不能洗去了他九萬萬元入超新紀錄的奇恥大辱，而反急需和鵠候着「婦女國貨年」的繼續努力，以成其志，也眞是可憐又復可笑的。</p>
<p>事實是很昭著着，關於過去我國婦女，尤其是都市裏的所謂摩登女郎，對於國貨的漠視，洋貨的樂於推銷，都是不可諱飾的事實，去年上海一埠的化妝品輸入，聞爲六十萬元，大好金錢，滚滚流出，按婦女爲家庭主婦，家政之主持人，而有如此之狂悖行動，自無怪我國貨界之提倡宣揚，奔走努力，盡屬事倍功半，鮮有成績，而急需我「娘兒們來幹」希冀有更好之成績。</p>
<p>歲序是更新了，我「婦女國貨」的高潮，也同時正在開始洶湧澎湃着，從此，我全國之婦女界，也都跟着這新的歲月，而憬悟以前的錯誤，努力未來的工作，並且，聯合一致，站在一條綫上，自今年起，以身作則，服用國貨，無論一絲一縷，一針一綫，唯國貨是購，從沉悶的空氣裏，突露出一綫光明，務使外貨絶跡，漏巵永塞，農村得以復興，</p>
<p>社會得以穩定，開婦女界未有之奇功，完成本年度最重大之使命。</p>
<h3>迎「婦女國貨年」</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>在四圍的呻吟和號哭中，我們這莊嚴偉大的國貨年，竟又像往年般地，很尋常很平淡的悠悠遠逝了，而業經各界命名、呈准政府，簇新美麗的婦女國貨年又却早已冉冉來臨，我人於此送舊迎新中，迥顧過去，展望未來，對於這新的年頭，自然更有一翻新的志願、新的希望，而有所祝禱者。</p>
<p>二二年度｜國貨年，在這過去的一年中，我們整個的國家，可以説都是黑漆一圑、外則强隣壓境，失地日增，内則農村破産，社會經濟崩潰，而最可痛心者，却爲九萬萬元的入超新紀錄，仍復表現於我大好之國貨年，看國内各地，外貨充斥，尤其是仇貨的活躍，甚至不惜以卑鄙的行爲，齷齪的手段，勾結奸商，肆行傾銷，使我購買力薄弱之民衆，引誘上鈎，再度剝削、此種情形。實爲我國貨前途最大之障碍，而急需以根本之剷除、勿使其日漸蔓延與擴大性。</p>
<p>雖然，過去是不値得追悔的，我們只要希冀未來，國貨年踨然不能將外貨輸入的漏巵杜塞，但，在這年頭裏，我國貨界諸人，奔走努力，宣揚提倡，倒底也造成了不少光榮的成績，最著者如中國國貨公司之成立，國貨介紹總所以及各地分所之創辦，各種國貨集會之紛設，使全國國貨産銷機關之普遍化，果亦無一不爲我國貨前途之曙光，實業振興之嚆矢，而足使我們興奮熱烈，益自勵進，務使去年末了之任務，而繼續完成於本年。</p>
<p>本年之命名定矣｜「婦女國貨年」之意義及由來，想亦早爲我人所共曉，誠如仰堯先生説：「國貨生機誰掌握，大權端在婦人們」，從今年起，我主持家政之主婦，誠能提倡國貨，樂於採用，勿再做洋貨推銷員，那麽本年度當然必有更好之成績，而獲最後之勝利。</p>
<p>際此喧　熱鬧之鑼鼓聲中，我全國之婦女界，想總不爲五色芬芳之賀年片所模糊，而對於本年度之認識，早具明確之見解，行見洋貨絶跡，漏巵永塞，爲國貨前途，放一異彩，是則爲我人今天唯一之希望也。</p>
<h3>名角登臺前的貢獻話</h3>
<p>— 陸伯羽</p>
<p>從去年的國貨年遞演爲今年的婦女國貨年，國貨運動漸趨於尖銳化，這不能不説是我國實業前途的一個好現象。拿演劇來説，去年國貨年是做好的一齣跳加官或大鬧臺，去年就是正角戲，婦女國貨年，當然也就是以婦女爲主角，生旦凈丑末，差不多完全要婦女們來扮演，男子們的責任，是跑龍套摇旗呐喊以壯聲勢而已。跑龍套的步伐跑錯了，當然是不好，可果主角的唱做工夫如果有不適當不安詳的地方，甚至於有荒腔走版，説不定臺下的觀衆，就要報以倒采呢！</p>
<p>我們都是劇中人，同時也都是觀劇者，去年演了一年的國貨劇，成績雖然不十分美滿，大致也還令人滿意，可惜到了年底，突然的傳來了一個消息，説是化裝品的進口，在十個月中，逹一百四十萬元之鉅，這好像劇塲上的藝員，正在演得興高采烈的當兒，忽然一大部分的女看客，通統離座他去·實在是一件大殺風景的事體。過去的開臺戲已經不談了，今年從頭再做起，今年所請的名角，一向是有號召力的·我們希望這一大批名角登塲以後，要始終不懈的賣力，使臺下的看客連聲呌好。使劇塲門口早早掛起客滿牌，使隔壁一家戲院門前冷落車馬稀·這不但使看客滿意，使老闆開心，卽是戲院中的案目茶房，也很感激這諸位名角，使得他們獲得較多的小賬·至於演員們如果始終賣力，當塲固然可以得着許多彩聲，趨後也就聲譽鵲起，使一般人認識了諸位名角的能力，增高諸位名角在藝術界中的地位，同時也不辜負了戲塲老闆們化了很大廣告費宣傳的苦心。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>提倡國貨與改良風俗</h3>
<p>— 李安夫</p>
<p>一個國家的强弱，雖則不是限於單方面，可是當此經濟能把持一切時代，只有經濟是萬能的；就是政治，也得根據經濟的力量，而决定他的方針。所以一個國家，如其在可能範圍以内，不使本國的金錢外溢，而使國内感到經濟恐慌，實在是一件幸福的事。（自然與帝國主義的資本輸出不同）但回顧中國，一切重工業的建設，固然要依賴國外，就是那輕工業的製造品，以及化妝品等等，也大都採用洋貨，而以爲榮耀；因此二十二年的國貨年，非但没有反國貨的出售率儘量的提高，反被他國的洋貨，借了這機會，冒充國貨，大事傾銷，國貨事業之前途，益發一落千丈了，細溯其原，當然是由於國貨淡能暢銷所致。</p>
<p>於是我們第一步應當研究的，就是怎様方能使國貨暢銷？自然，報上的廣告，呌喊的口號，壁上的標語，不過造成了提倡國貨的空氣；在實際上，他的效力，還是很微小的；因此我們不得不再作進一步的棆檢討了。從各國的情形方面觀察之下，只有把這惡劣的風俗，人心改革過來，方才有救；因爲提倡國貨，作形式上的提倡，果然没有多大效用，倘若用了國家的力量，去强迫人民，採用國貨，在事實上，也斷難實行；於是我們只得利用這風俗習慣來改良了。在過去的歷史中，像這様的例子，正也不在少數，卽就目前所見的而論；像日本就是個好例子，日本的婦女，雖則穿得花花綠綠，打扮得花枝招展，但是他們所用的，所穿的，都是他們的本國貨；日本的學生，也是以穿國貨制服爲榮的，其他像日用的東西等等，也非本國貨不買；記得有一次，朋友告訴我説：住在上海的日本人，他們吃的醬油，也是由日本帶來的。從這很小的地方，我們可以看出日本人的愛國心、是何等濃厚呀！還有德國的人民，他們愛用國貨的心，正也不亞於日本；他們國家之所以能够强盛，這也是一大原因。</p>
<p>今年是「婦女國貨年」。提倡者果然費了好些心理的揣摩才定下這名目來，不過是否有效，却也難説得很；因爲女人們的心理，大都是喜歡虚榮的，奢侈的，只要她所選的東西漂亮美觀，往往不管是國貨或是洋貨，就掏出錢來購買了；而一般智識比較次一等的女子呢？毎毎缺乏自擇的能力，只知摹倣人家，看見人家買什麽，她也買什麽；而且家中的用具，和丈夫所用的物品，除特殊外，也大都由婦女去辦理的；於是此風一啓，國貨就没有提倡的一日了；倘若能够一改這種劣根性，抱非國貨不買的决心，那末自然不難把這風氣改革過來了；而况所謂時髦，摩登，也是漫無標凖的隨着潮流而轉移的，假使在家以爲用國貨是時髦，那還有誰去用洋貨呢？並且提倡國貨，不過只要把購物時的目的，轉變一下就得了，又不是一件難事。如果事實果能與理想相符合，則國貨不提倡而自提倡，洋貨不排斥而自排斥了，到那時候，一部份的金錢，也就不至外溢了。</p>
<p>綜而論之，要提倡國貨，要從女同胞做起，而婦女們尤當首先把這奢華的風俗，改革過來；再造成一個良好的風俗，方才有良好的成績做出來。我希望女同胞們·不要以爲這是一件平常的事｜而虚負了這「婦女國貨年」的美名。</p>
<p>婦女與國貨談座</p>
<h3>告太太小姐們！</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>出風頭就在今年</p>
<p>許多朋友們聚會在一起，所談的話，不外下面幾種；　　㈠自已職業問題㈡家庭間的瑣事㈢國貨問題</p>
<p>前者非本刋範圍所及，茲不加多　，至於第三項呢？我們不談則已，一談起來，大家對於國貨運動、似乎非常悲觀，不約而同的説：「女子眞是外貨的推銷員，國貨的敵人，：：：激烈一些的朋友甚至説：「國貨之敵人，不在外人，不在日本，在乎女人：：：」唉！這論調，聽上去似乎覺得過火，但細細地加以分析一下，却也不錯，試看去年報上刋着，僅僅外國香水化妝品一項，其入超已有一千四百餘萬元之鉅，其他如衣服用費，一切的一切，當不在内，如果把女子所用的外貨，一齊計算起來，其數目一定大可驚人，所以，提倡國貨須從婦女入手，却是唯一的方法，不二的法門！</p>
<p>好了，今年是婦女國貨年，女權高於一切，在今年婦女們要來領導舉行國貨運動了！這是一個多麽動聽的消息，偉大的壯舉，値得的婦女界同胞報告一下的。</p>
<p>在往年，一談到提倡國貨，便要連帶咒駡女人，今年，該是婦女們，太太們，小姐們，女學生們，出風頭的時光了！願你們從今而後，快快起來努力，把以往的一切服用外貨的行動，統統剷除，信仰外國貨的心理，也一齊改革，從今年起，凡屬婦女，要把一個非國貨不用，非國貨不買的决心，要自上至下，自内至外，上上下下，裏裏外外，都是國貨，這様，婦女的責任才盡，才是一個頂天立地，愛家愛國，愛已愛人的好女子：</p>
<p>婦女們，這是你們出風頭的時候啊！請從此努力吧？</p>
<h3>信不信由你</h3>
<p>— 兪洽成</p>
<p>㈠前言</p>
<p>從國貨年到婦女國貨年，事實上是換藥不換湯；然而，爲什麽又要來這麽一套，打開窗子説亮話，時勢緊迫，怎能不仰仗夫人小姐的大力！這雖然是老調，信不信由你事實勝於雄辯，怎由你不信呢。</p>
<p>㈡調味飛機</p>
<p>一飯一粥須知來處不易，就是離開那油鹽柴米，單表調味粉這一項。在那航空救國的聲浪中，曾有天廚飛機的出現，區區一勺一勺的小東西，竟有如許的道理。</p>
<p>㈢化裝救國</p>
<p>跳舞救國曾被人攻擊作滑稽舉動，塗粉弄脂却也有若干的意思，據説我們的太太小姐們支出項下，集腋成裘竟至數目驚人，如果不送給侮辱中國的法人可的（化裝品大王），就是不摒却鉛華，專用國貨，總得挽回一部分漏巵。</p>
<p>㈣夜着　履</p>
<p>誰敢呌人不着衣履！可是，時裝並不專指用舶來品剪裁的東西，高眼皮鞋，長統絲襪曾貢獻若干國家民族的膏脂；好在我們並不要學甘地去穿印度土製的羢布，有許多國産的東西，確也在廉美各方有眞實的證據。</p>
<p>㈤糖酒與酖</p>
<p>告訴你，吃外國糖，吸外國烟，飲外國酒，不祇耗費自已個人的經濟，就國家經濟方面，也受有重大損失；有成語爲證：「飲酖止渴」？</p>

<h3>婦女國貨年</h3>
<p>— 忻忻</p>
<p>今年是「婦女國貨年」，而現在是「婦女國貨年」的開始，在「婦女國貨年」開始的今天，一般人都善頌善禱的講吉利話，希望「婦女國貨年」的所以成爲「婦女國貨年」。可是，與其善頌善禱，還不如檢舉本身的錯悞，庶作以後的借鏡。</p>
<p>所以，這裏所寫的，不是善頌善禱而是自我批判。雖然筆者不是婦女而是男子。</p>
<p>無容諱言，也無可諱言的，中國婦女在過去是有着許多的錯悞的。</p>
<p>就以化妝品一項來説，據國際貿易局指導處所説，本年度各國進口的香水脂粉等化妝品，已逹一百三十九萬八千六百六十四元（上面是十二月五日報載，至年底止，當還不止此數。）</p>
<p>同時，我們再來看十一月二十九日日文上海日報所載：</p>
<p>近來由日本輸入品中，最顯著者，首推雜貨，而維貨中，以鏡爲尤多，毎次船舶進口，必有三四十箱，多則五十餘箱，本月進口連絡船貨物船，合計在三百箱以上，毎箱以十二打計，約在四萬面左右，中國人所愛穿皮鞋，其爲婦女用者，亦不在少數，每船多至六十箱，毎箱裝有二百雙者，逹四百箱，自伸秋以來，一般消耗品之需要，非常旺盛，此亦中國中流家庭經濟餘裕的好現象，中國婦女購買力遞增，故最近街頭氣象頓呈活氣云。</p>
<p>過去，我們所見到聽到的對新女性的批評，大都是；「生産不足，消費有餘八個字，這固然是抺殺一切的刻薄，對婦女性的歧視，可是這刻薄，這歧視，自有他刻薄，歧視的原因的！</p>
<p>這刻薄，歧視的原因，便是上層階級的婦女，中層階級的婦女祇知道在衣，食，住，行各方面奢侈，浮華，儘量的揮霍以表示她們是一位貴族階級的婦女。</p>
<p>這，在一般無智識的女性如此，就是在有機會在大學裏唸書的女性還是如此！</p>
<p>我們在敎育部最近所發表的「視察滬六大學報告摘要」裏可以見到對於女生的批評：</p>
<p>曁南：「惟學生服飾，未見樸素，女生尤甚」。</p>
<p>滬江：「學生習於奢華，女生尤甚」。</p>
<p>光華：「學生大都奢侈歐化，女生裝飾尤甚」。</p>
<p>大夏：「惟學生風尙多趨奢侈，女生更見浮華」。</p>
<p>事實是最雄辯的，有了上面的鐵證，我們不必再説什麽話了，説了還是多餘的。我覺得。</p>
<p>而同時在下層階級的婦女呢，他們同様知道漂亮，同様要漂亮，對於高貴的物質固無從獲得，可是她們對於樸素的土布等，是也同様的因之厭惡而丢棄了，同時，各國的傾銷政策都以中國爲市塲，而日本的布匹等物更是出奇地低廉，三角，四角可以買到一丈花色很好看的布。</p>
<p>這當然都是過去的「事實」，無可諱言，同時也不必諱言的「事實」，</p>
<p>從今天起，中：「婦女」的「國貨年」了。</p>
<p>「婦女國貨年」，當然是表示婦女們覺醒的最有力的表示。而在「婦女國貨年」裏，我們新的女性將用事實來回答一切歧視新女性的人們！</p>
<p>我們希望，這「婦女國貨年」不僅在提倡國貨，愛用國貨上使人們知道她們的力量，並且憑着她們的頭腦，她們的生命力，在别方面有所成就，使一切與歧視的人人承認他們歧視的錯悞！尤其將這過去的錯悞自動的改正！</p>
<p>婦女界貢獻</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年之意見</h3>
<p>— 聶會紀芬</p>
<p>十數年來，年年高唱抵制，提倡國貨，而洋貨入超，年年增進，已可謂滑稽矣。近兩年日寇日急，抵制自然亦較勇猛，而日貨之輸入激增，入超數直逹九萬萬，駭人之巨額，同時國人工商業，皆奄奄垂斃，則更可悲傷矣。</p>
<p>吾人對於此矛盾之現狀若不深思而明瞭其原因，則又何必加入此滑稽劇中，供外人竊笑哉？</p>
<p>吾以爲提倡國貨，其努力不僅在提倡國貨，而在改正各個人不正當之觀念，蓋觀念爲欲望之根本，須以謀國民利益爲吾人應有之義務，方能犠牲個人愛美好華貴之欲望，庶幾國貨不提倡而能發逹，若如今日社會之崇仰歐美風俗趨向物質享用，提倡時裝美飾，專顧便利適意，則决不能兼顧國家與人民之利益矣。今日所以有此矛盾之現象，其病根卽在此而已，别無原因也。</p>
<p>提倡國貨，初不因抵制仇貨，而爲圖國家及個人生存之計，必應如此，識淺之人，不知此義，以爲我購少許洋貨，何至影響及於國家，尤其是個人之生存乎？彼不知至民窮財盡之時，則戰爭變亂，乃必然之勢，彼時並不須殺人放火，愉因食糧缺乏，生活無法，老幼弱病者自然窮困凍餓以死也。</p>
<p>今日我國各地失業者，盈千累萬，歐美各國失業者，各數百萬或至千餘萬，皆由工商業衰敗之故，卽世界購買力日减所致，簡言之，世界金融枯竭，至今日而極矣，彼識淺者，目覩商塲外表之繁榮，又自謂手邊尙有餘財，或有學問技能，足以自立，以爲此問題暫不至影響及於我也，殊不知美國於過去兩年間，倒閉之銀行至二千家之多，富而立貧者，不計其數，向充工程師領巨薪之人，忽然而至粥廠排班就食，失業之人及兒童，常有在垃圾桶旁覓取食物者，（美人慣糟踏食物，故有抛棄尙可食之物）此豈常人所能料哉？</p>
<p>日本之强，由於人民能愛其國，此人所共知也，夫愛國者不在口號與紙寫之標語，而在少數人居較高層之地位者，自有明白正當之觀念，及刻苦努力之實行，以爲羣衆之先導，日本人於其歷史遺傳之文化風俗，均能愛惜而光大之，不隨西洋人轉移，例如席地而坐，毎晚臨時設舖，不便極矣，木展，背包，高髻，皆不便之物也，皆能一一保存，雖富裕之家，亦不改變，須知東方文化，多以勤勞儉薄爲道德，地方風俗之美惡，亦從此點品評之，日本所保存者東方之好文化也，存之則獎進勤勞儉樸，若棄之而摹仿西洋，則趨向奢侈惰逸，蓋西洋物事，便則便矣，而習用之者，個人之本能日就消失，今日歐美工商業對於日本競爭，均告失敗，無他，個人之效能率相差甚遠也，此高率效能之養成，蓋由能保存坐地席所致，况日本若愛慕西洋風俗，則鐵床木器，已足早使日本經濟力枯竭，卽使其多數自製，則又必大减其輸出力，何能取得外國之金錢，爲此驚人之建設乎？今日彼國有此成績，則五十年前負社會指導責任之少數偉人，見地明白，而自能刻苦之故也。</p>
<h3>美容的風波</h3>
<p>— 巧明</p>
<p>陽光是軟弱無力的，樹木的枝葉變爲枯黃，風，有點兒塞意，秋已深了！</p>
<p>這天陳先生的家裏，忽然發生了一些小小的風波，原因是｜｜陳先生買回來一瓶護膚品，他很得意的交到他夫人的手裏。</p>
<p>『買回來了嗎，多少錢一瓶』？賢明的陳夫人問。</p>
<p>『一塊二角錢一瓶』。陳先生答。</p>
<p>『小小的一瓶東西，就要一元二角的代價嗎。太貴了｜太貴了！』</p>
<p>『是老牌的外國貨呢，質料非常好。』</p>
<p>『你是洋貨的崇拜者嗎？』陳夫人立刻把臉沉下來，她嚴厲的説；『現在的時代，誰都知道提倡國貨，而你却要做洋貨垢推銷員。你知道洋貨是好的，但你知道國貨年來進步是很快嗎？况且洋貨搽在臉上，就是美也要算是醜。你你能舍本求末，我却不能出醜！：：：』</p>
<p>陳先生被陳夫人説得啞口無言了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，陳先生到五洲藥房去買了一磅裝的大罐美容霜回來。</p>
<p>『你看！這是國貨，只費了七角五分的代價，就可以供我們全家人一冬的用呢。』陳夫人得意的説着。</p>
<p>陳先生没有言語，這塲風波他顯然是失敗了！</p>

<h3>國産雀斑藥水之新出品</h3>
<p>— 徐履謙</p>
<p>我國婦女在化妝時都用鉛質粉敷面，不知鉛性有毒；久而久之，敷粉處隨現雀斑，婦女特多，實爲美容上一大缺憾。</p>
<p>除雀斑藥水藥膏，市上舶來品計多數，價格極昻，國産雖有出品，但無多大效力，故國人都不信任之，以致該項舶來藥品，毎年侵銷國内，其數亦很可觀。</p>
<p>陳希芝女醫師，留德有年，得醫學博士學位，歸國後卽自設診所外，復掛牌南洋藥房及中法藥房，近更創設健美製藥工業社於法租界薩坡賽路二一七號，專製雀斑神效膏雀斑除根水等美容藥數種，實爲國産美容藥水之佼佼者，余曾試用，效騐極佳，樂爲介紹。</p>
<p>家庭訪問記</p>
<h3>聶太夫人</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>聶太夫人，名紀芬，爲湘鄉曾文正公的季女，自幼愛文正公的庭訓，薫陶於良好敎育之下，故能書能文，有文姬道蘊之風，而持躬儉樸，古道照人，尤爲時下女子所望塵不及。其公子聶雲台先生，布衣蔬食，倡爲大冀主義，詔示靑年，自食其力，人人效法甘地，自紡自織，以布衣救國難，是太夫人的敎育。其四公子　生，主辦恒豐紗廠，努力製造國紗國布，以與日紗相抗衡，也是太夫人的敎育。我們信仰太夫人的道德學問，尤其景仰太夫人的家庭。太夫人的治家，可以當得起「淡泊質直，彬彬有禮」八個字，凡家中所有衣食用具，都是崇尙國産，卽一杯，一針，一匣炎柴，也是惟國貨是用。入其門，整肅而有秩序，無奢華氣，其公子女公子以及媳婦孫公子孫媳輩，都侍奉太夫人必恭必敬，太夫人亦以禮對之，卽僮僕傭婦，亦御之有禮，無疾言，無遽色，以八十二齡之高年，望之如六十許人，其修養得法，於此可見。太夫人之主張提倡國貨，謂不在口號與標語，而在居領導地位的人，都有明白正當的觀念，及刻苦努力的實行，極佩服日本人不肯輕易爲西洋風氣所轉移。以日本婦人，至今高髻，本屐，背包，席地，一一保存勿失，看似頑固，然而金錢不致外溢，外貨無由輸入，却爲日本富强之基礎。中國人則反是，以十九世紀的生産力，而欲享受二十世紀的物質文明，宜乎年年入超，窮困如此。太夫人説到這裏，不由地老淚盈眶，太息者再。終謂今日提倡國貨，其努力不僅在提倡國貨，而在改正各個人不正當之觀念。人人能犠牲個人愛美好的欲望，庶幾國貨不提倡而發逹，苟人人崇拜歐風美俗，趨向摩登，專講適意便利，國家與人民，交受其殃，其害不知伊於胡底云云。慈祥愷悌的言詞，僣溫文爾雅的道貎，令人油然起敬。聞聶氏家庭，從無口實閒氣，融融怡怡，聶太夫人時時召集兒女孫輩及族人講述先德及種嘉言懿訓，與服用國貨之詔示，雲台先生等均有筆記或刋入聶氏家訓中。雲台先生夫婦及兒女等服御，均極樸素大方，不尙奢華，力戒靡麗，待人接物，尤謙恭有禮，故聶氏家中人出外，人一望而知之。此皆太夫人的敎誨功深所致。太夫人做事，尤能始終一貫，毫不倦怠，元旦日婦女交誼大會，太夫人爲主席，率其家人到會，終席而去，毫無倦容，高年人有此坐性，更爲難得云。</p>

<p>工業製造、在世界各國中、享盛名者、當首推德國、而世人簽謂以德之職業敎育助成之力爲大茲將其現狀、分别略述之如次、</p>
<p>（一）職業學校之分類</p>
<p>補習學校德國習慣、凡欲習一業、或成一技者、必須從師匠受業、此在數世紀前已如此、此種制度、稱爲師徒制度、師徒之間、自成一種不成文之契約、爲期數年、在此期内、學徒在師匠家庭之内、其待遇與家人同、及近世工業製造發逹、師徒之制、在手工業中、雖稍有限制、而名分等級及訓練、則更爲嚴密規定、凡手工業學徒、在規定習期滿時、須受工匠考試（Gesellenprufung）、成績及格、得稱工匠、再經數年工匠服務、年齡至二十五歲以上、方可呈請受匠師考試(Meisrprufung）、凡曾經匠師考試及格者、方得在工塲自收學徒、此項學徒辦法、在商業中、亦有存在、惟較爲自由、非法律所規定、在大製造廠中、亦常沿用此種習慣、每令技能熟練工匠、培養學徒、</p>
<p>德國憲法規定、凡已受過八年國民學校敎育之靑年男女、不論在工廠爲學徒、或已就相當職業者、若年在十四歲以上、尙年滿十八歲者、必須受補習敎育、此項憲法規定之學校、稱爲補習學校（Fortbildungsscbule）、雖全國各地、尙未能完全實施、而凡城市巨鎭、則此項學校、皆已成立、但鄉村之間、已設立補習學校者、亦不在小數、全國補習學校之組織、並不統一、其學程都爲三年、但所授時數不多、故學科務求淺近、除職業功課外、有公民·數學·簿記·德文·體育·衛生·及職業應用之製圖等、對於日常通用之書信文件、亦甚注意、若爲女子班、則有縫紉、烹調家事等課、但學科及敎材、有時隨地需要而異、如在工商業發逹之大城市、補習受課人員特多、可每科設一班、分班敎授、如金工鎖匠木匠成衣匠等、各設一班授課、若在偏僻地方、補習學生不多、則依各業之大類而分班、如各項金工業合爲一班、各項木工業合爲一班、若在極小區域、人數過少、則合各業補習人員、混合敎授、</p>
<p>對於農村區域内、從事農業之靑年、如農家子女及工役、亦有同様學校之設備、與其他補習學校性質、稍有不同、授課期間、全在冬令、名爲農事補習學校（LandlicheFcrtbildnngsscbule)、農　事補習學校之目的、爲農家靑年、保持其在小學中所得田間之文化與工作、生活之智識、及養成其農事藝術上、根本智識與技能、學生入補習學校之義務、各地方政府、法令上亦有規定、亦有由各地城市鄉村、自行規定者、凡靑年受雇人員、每星期應有自四小時至八小時之就學時間、雇主有准許雇員於工作時間内、入學上課之義務、</p>
<p>職業學校補習學校、僅爲已受雇之員工、補充智識而設、非以訓練專門技能也、故工商各業、爲訓練專技工匠、及工程人員起見、另有職業學校（Facbschule)之設立、職業學校之入學、爲自由而非强迫性質、爲全日學校而非半工半讀學校、只有少數學校、有半日課程、學生得於課餘、另就他處實習工作也、</p>
<p>職業學校、培養人才、須適合各級學力不同學生之需求、故學校程度、須分别深淺、以應此項之要求、第一類學校、爲學生於就業之前、習練藝術之所、此類學校、稱爲預備職業學校（Vorbere</p>

<p>歷年埠際賽足球比賽、祇滬港或滬津兩隊比賽、而滬港津三埠同在一地會賽者、先前僅舉行一次、因上海爲南北中心點、故在上海舉行、結果天津奪得錦標、本季將作第二次三角會戰、地點仍在上海、定廢曆新年舉行、滬港津三埠均在積極凖備、挑選精銳、凖備奪標、茲將詳情探錄如下、</p>
<p>天津天津方面已舉行兩次預選試賽、一次在新年中、分國聯與軍聯兩隊、華人入選者僅孫思敬一人、結果國際以六比二勝、第二次上星期日舉行、分紅白兩隊、結果白隊以七比四勝、是日羅克斯堡因病未登塲、德勒姜璐等表演均甚佳、先是、前半時、白隊以六比一勝利、後半時雙方陣綫略有更動、傑漢遜、瓊士、愛却爾、倒戈登陣、反以三、</p>
<p>比一獲勝、總計爲七比四、白隊勝利、津埠代表陣綫、大致已擬定如下、</p>
<p>赫歐　　　　　　姜璐</p>
<p>逹西瓦　　　　　　　　　傑漢遜</p>
<p>莫脫　　　　孫思敬　　　　　布杜夫</p>
<p>德勒　　　　　　　　　　瓊士</p>
<p>羅克斯堡　　　　愛却爾</p>
<p>預備員懷芬、米俠瑞柯人、</p>
<p>香港香港方面於本月三日舉行試賽、分藍白兩隊、以白隊爲理想之陣綫、表演未見美妙、華人參加者爲黃紀良梁榮照鄭季良楊水益譚江柏何家强等、結果白隊以二比一勝、賽後經足球總會縝密考慮、選技十四人爲正式代表、華人中選者爲黃紀良、梁榮照、譚江柏、鄭季良四人、（均南華選手）並决定隊長爲柯克、大小告山奴雖未出席試賽、仍依照過去表演成績、當選爲正式隊員、約於二月九日啓程赴滬、陣容大致如下、</p>
<p>柯克</p>
<p>羅拔巨　　大告山奴</p>
<p>摩利遜　　　　　　烈特厘</p>
<p>黃紀良　　　　　比路屈勞　　侯活</p>
<p>史杜蘭治　　　　　譚江柏</p>
<p>梁榮照　　鄭季良</p>
<p>小告山奴</p>
<p>上海上海方面本人材甚多、勝利之希望較濃、去年在港得勝歸來後、應天津西聯會之邀、北上比賽、對於人選方面、濫宇充數、致遭一比七之慘敗、爲上海埠際隊史上空前之恥辱、大受北方人士之誹謗、本季在上海作三角競技、港津均愼重人選、來滬討戰、滬隊固當格外愼選、元旦日之試賽、表演尙佳、但球員未出塲者甚多、猶不足以觀其究竟、待二次試賽時、當可略示端倪、</p>

<h3>對於兒童年的感想</h3>
<p>— 陳退甘</p>
<p>記得去年十月間，中華慈幼恊會，曾呈准政府定今年爲兒童年，隨後上海市兒童幸福委員會，更擬定兒童年的一切辦法，呈請政府備案，毎年的四月四日，我國已效法歐美各國，定爲兒童節，如今又有兒童年，倒也新鮮有趣，然而我不得不發生一點感想。</p>
<p>我國社會，向來是不注意兒童的，一般人的心理，都以爲孩子們懂得甚麽，自然不能與成人一様看待。有孩子的人家，連貸房居住，必發生困難，（不佞眷屬旅滬四年，搬塲三次，毎次看房，二房東必先問我家中有幾個孩子，在他的腦筋中，以爲有三五個孩子的家庭，都定喧擾討厭，）弄堂中婦女打駡孩子們的聲音，更是震耳欲聾，勞工們的妻子，生下小孩，甚至　在垃圾桶中，純潔的小朋友，你們的幸福在那裏？怎得不令人痛心？</p>
<p>反觀歐美各國，對於兒童，是何等的愛護？社會上一切公共設備，差不多總有兒童的地位；都市中兒童公園，幼兒敎育塲所，更是觸目皆是，而一般學者，且高唱二十世紀，是兒童世紀的論調。歐美兒童們幸福如此，中國兒童之不爲人重視如彼，相形之下，格外令人痛心。</p>
<p>兒童是國家未來的主人翁，民族進展的新元素，我們如果欲把國家民族振興起來，就非加意維護孩子們不可。本年上海市兒童幸福會，積極籌辦各種托兒所，而主持其事者又多爲國内敎育專家，代家庭敎養兒童，代國家培植元素，這確是一件偉大慈善的社會敎育事業。願各界人士，各盡其力以扶助之，要曉得這種設施，不僅是孩子們個人的幸福問題，乃是整個民族盛衰的問題，任何人都應該負一點責任。</p>
<p>最後，我尤其希望兒童幸福委員會，能將這種設施，推廣到各省各縣去，使全國慈善圑體，聞風繼起，多産生幾個蒙台梭利，民族前途，實深利賴。</p>
<h3>查三爺與沙三爺</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>蘇州有一句俗語：「」查三爺飛金葉紙」。是譏笑紈袴子弟的揮霍無度，到後來必至一貧如沈。據説是有一椿故事的，他在重陽日，登北寺報恩塔，見人家飛彩紙，非常好玩，他就買了許多金葉紙，從塔上飛下來，塔下人都疑天下黃金雨，爭奪喧　，轟動遠近。明齋小誌説，這是靑浦黃學乾的事，當時並有「要緊窮」之誚。然而黃已無人提起，查則有演成戲劇的，名「查潘鬥富」。究竟是黃是查？不得而知。</p>
<p>誰知烏程陸長春香飲樓賓談，還有一個沙三爺咧。那沙三爺是豪奢得可以，端午日因着雇不到船，不能到虎邱去看競渡，到了明年，預先一個月，命僮僕向城内外船户一齊雇定，不許雇給别人。到了端午日，人家雇不到船，齊向沙三爺商量轉雇。沙三爺慨然允諾，指定地點，分别派遣，船中陳列着現成的酒肴，還有妙妓侑酒，不必費遊客一文。從此沙三爺的大名，婦孺皆知。後來窮得販賣小食餬口，喜唱俚曲小調，兒童買三個大錢的油餅，也要他唱「剪花沙夜夜游」之類一闋。可是人家還是稱他三爺。雖然他没有飛金葉紙的事，和查三爺的行徑是差不多的。或者查三爺和沙三爺，一而二，二而一，因爲查沙同韵，容易纒誤。否則同是三爺，「何其巧也」呢！並且關於沙三爺的話，此外别無所見，賓談所記，未注年代，大概得諸傳聞，更有誤查爲沙的可能了，</p>
<p>現在的蘇州，决没有查三爺這般豪舉了。就是有幾個紈袴子弟，只求自已的享樂，誰願意便宜了别人。到了這個大冷天，他們在家裏圍着火爐，聽無綫電播音，吸雪茄烟，飲白蘭地酒。門口討一個銅板的呌化，都給門房揮之他去了。那麽查三爺也算得戞戞獨造，難能可貴，雖敗（敗子也）猶榮了。</p>
<h3>寒風</h3>
<p>— 錢小山</p>
<p>寒風愁向夕。獵獵擾車塵。作客光陰賤。還家笑語眞。兵戈殊未已。喪亂豈無因。來日誰能計。難爲　畝民。</p>
<h3>長至</h3>
<p>— 錢小山</p>
<p>海市騰歡節。燈前影獨傷。寒初嫌酒薄。夜未抵愁長。落落今何世。漫漫天有霜。不須吹六琯。我自歎迷陽。</p>
<h3>「接吻耐久」的實騐報告</h3>
<p>— 亞門</p>
<p>本刋前此登載了「紐約的接吻耐久比賽會」一則奇聞，哄動了我們全校的同人，爭相傳説。我的同仁，有的年紀超過了四十，家主婆是不懂接吻爲何事的黃臉婆；有的年紀剛過二十。還未接觸過密司，自然。杜六思女士和伊戀人那樣耐久的成績。他們是不會相信的。但是，也有半信半疑的一部份人物在。因此，全不相信的和半信半疑的發生爭辯｜打趣的爭辯了。</p>
<p>我是新婚未久，我的夫人還在縣立女子師範讀書，在同仁們看來是比較新式的。他們爭辯的下塲，是要我回去實騐</p>
<p>我和新夫人接吻是有過的，但並没有計算過長短，也不曾有意去體味過苦樂。這次，他們爭辯得熱烈時，我就有意思要回去實騐了，一等到他們委任下來，我是毫不遲疑地受命了。</p>
<p>我的新夫人正忙着預備第四次月考，我晚上九點鐘回府，伊還在孜孜兀兀。我要求伊接吻，伊勉强地應付我一下，又把眼睛注視到書上去了。我繼續要求，伊不可肯了。我和伊討論明天日間的事情。伊回答我；「没有那麽空的時間」。我掃興了，也就作罷。</p>
<p>我改課卷，伊看書，直至十一時，我倆才睡的。不知怎様，辛勞了一天，雖倦，可是睡不着。白天的事情，只是在腦裏好奇地跳動。我耐不住，没有徵求同意，摟緊了伊就吻。啊喲，不好，没有滿一分鐘就分開了。這，並不是給未曾同意的伊推開的，我委實耐不住了。杜女士的三小時餘的成績，我眞驚羡，驚羡得有些不相信。</p>
<p>我和伊的嘴合攏着，同時不能不呼吸，四個鼻管裏出來的炭氣，撞在一起，會撞出響聲來。在那小小的鼻餘之地，在那一分鐘十六次呼吸的短時間内，炭氣來不及散開，新空氣來不及衝來，第二次吸收的仍是炭氣，怪不好過。要是兩人先後着呼吸吧，那更糟，我吸收的恰是伊的炭氣，伊吸的也恰是我的炭氣，更不好過。吸收炭氣的事情，我不願也不能多做，况且又不想得什麽錦標，所以没有滿一分鐘就敗陣了。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>金華觀鬥牛記（上）</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>鬥牛這一件玩意兒，從人道主義的觀點上看來，似乎是一件很殘暴的事情，然而在另一方面看來，則又是一椿發揚民氣，提倡尙武精神的美舉。大概天下萬事，有利必有弊，我們也不必仔細討論；祇就膚淺的表面現象來説，那末鬥牛總不失爲獸戲中比較精采的一幕。</p>
<p>中國人對於鬥牛的認識，（指大部份人言）我相信十九都是從書本上，電影上看來的，而且大家所知道的祗是西班牙人的鬥牛。我自已當然也是如此。我祗從前人的筆記上以及電影上，看到許多建築宏偉的鬥牛塲，角上縛着尖刀的牛，被硬帮着來做犠牲品的馬，以及那些挺着長矛，身手矯健的武士。換句話説，我們大多數人祗是以爲鬥牛是歐洲中土諸國的專利品，又是一種很複雜的角技，在美洲或東亞是永遠没有見到的機會的。但是，出乎我們的意料之外，在杭江鐵路全綫通車典禮的節目單上、竟發現了「金華觀鬥牛」的一行字，這是何等動人的一個節目啊！</p>
<p>我們一行幾個人，受了這一個驚人的節目的吸引，利用了職務上的便利，居然在民國二十二年十二月二十八日中午兩點鐘模様，從天空中只見烟煤的上海，踏到了山明水秀的金華。金華對於我們，因爲火腿的關係，當然是耳食已久的一個熟地方了。（其實附帶告訴你們，火腿的出産地是東陽，金華不過是一個轉口站而已。）我們從火車上走下去之後，勉强在杭江路全綫通車典禮的會塲上逗留了四五分鐘，故來不及的跨過了鐵軌，奔到站的對面去，欣賞我們的主要目的物｜｜鬥牛。</p>
<p>鬥牛塲恰巧是設在一片三面都是山的平陽上。好幾千的人在各個山頭上擠着，喊着，浮動着，從相距幾十丈的地方看去，活剝剝地是一副「打人墻」的景象。於是我們幾個人便沿着一條高低不平的土岡走上去，走到半腰上，就看見有兩根竹竿，挑起一面白底黑字的布旗，大書「鬥牛塲」三字。旗的旁邊，有一位穿土布大衫的先生給了我一張秩序單，那是用銅字排印的，想不到他們竟是這様的考究！</p>
<p>秩序單上印得很淸楚，第一對是某某兩條牛相鬥，第二對又是某某兩條牛相鬥，一共倒有十幾對之多，而這些牛公的大名之特别，眞是有些匪夷所思。最普通的是稱什麽「掛」，像「像雙牙掛」「英雄掛」「烏龍掛」：：：之類，究竟這個「掛」字應作何解，那可想不出來了。此外尙有借用古人名的如「羅成」，「武松」之類。最奇怪的則有「小隨便」，「小爛汚」，「新花旦」，「小花旦」等等，可説是隨手拈來，毫無意識可言，祗是一味的滑稽取笑罷了。</p>
<p>走上山頭·好容易在許多金華朋友的肩下，搶到了一些立足之地，大家便伸長了脖頸，望中間看去。中間原是一片平地，現在却現出了一個長闊各十數丈的淺水塘了；塘的四周，有無數佃家打扮的人，赤着腿圑圑地圍在那裏。中間又有幾個擄拳勒袖的人，混身全濺着泥槳，連頭臉上也有，差不多已像一個泥人模様；據説是特地推舉出來當公證人或助手的鬥牛專家，待兩條牛鬥得扭在一起的當兒，他們便過去拆開，使每一條牛不得有越軌的舉動，並使每一條牛都有均等的作戰機會</p>
<p>那末這些牛究竟怎様鬥法呢？</p>
<p>當我從上海北火車站出發的時候起，一直到走上鬥牛塲爲止，我的心總是不停的在跳躍，以爲我必將看到一幕洞胸貫腹，血肉横飛的慘劇了。我想這一次從上海或杭州去的人多半是這様想吧！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回</p>
<p>絮語燈前苦心訓弱息</p>
<p>杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>趙翁對於他所以在門外徘徊的原因，這時就恍然了，於是把那根棗木棍子，放在懷裏，抱着拳頭，向積之連連拱了幾下，高着聲音，呵呵大笑道；這様説着，我就不敢當了。積之道老太爺精神很好，今天天氣很好也出來散步散步嗎？趙翁道；我聽説西山的紅葉很好看，想去瞧瞧。積之道；走了去嗎？趙翁手拿了棗木棍子，便微笑了一笑，另外一隻手却去順理着胸前的鬍子。積之笑道；紅葉在八大處，不在碧雲寺，由這兒去，來回總也有四五十里吧？趙翁笑道；老弟台，您别瞧我一大把年紀，走個二三十里地，眞不算什麽。我打算走了去，雇一頭牲口回來。我正嫌一個人走着寂寞，二爺，您有這個興致嗎？積之回想着去年有和桂枝看紅葉的一件事，不覺又到了看紅葉的時候。前後映證起來，正令人生着無窮的感慨，現在桂枝大有侯門一入深如海的光景，藉了這個機會，和這老者同走一二十里路，探探桂枝的消息，却也不壞。加之自已正是十分煩惱的時候，也可以解解悶。便笑道；若是老太爺有這種興致，我就奉陪。趙翁聽到説他肯奉陪，心下大喜，去和他抱拳拱了幾拱手，笑道；趁着天氣早，我們就走罷。走乏了也不要緊，我們走到那兒算那兒。鄉間的飯早，彼具都是吃過了飯的，於是也不躭誤，順着大道，就開始走了去。誰知趙翁精力强壯，走起路來，恰不在積之以下，手裏拿的那根棗木棍子，他常是倒拖着走。二人一面閑談着，一面走路，也就不怎様的感到疲乏，到了下兩點多鐘的時候，就到了西山脚下了。（二八八）</p>

<p>鼻子生得平而小，没有歐洲人那麽高峻，那是没有法子的，然而倘使我們身邊有幾角錢，却一様的可以看電影。偵探片子演厭了，愛情片子爛熟了，戰爭片子看膩了，滑稽片子無聊了，於是乎有「人猿泰山」，有「獸林怪人」，有「斐洲探險」等等，要野獸和野蠻登塲。然而在蠻地中，也還一定要穿挿一點蠻婆子的蠻曲綫。如果我們也還愛看，那就可見無論怎様奚落，也還是有些戀戀不捨的了，「性」之於市儈，是很要緊的。</p>
<p>文學在西歐，春碰壁和電影也並不兩様；有些所謂文學家也者，也得找尋些奇特的（Grotesque)，色情的(Erotic)東西，去給他們的主顧滿足，因此就有</p>
<p>探險式的旅行，目的倒並不在地主的打拱或請酒。然而倘遇獃問，則以笑話了之，他其實也知道不了這些，他也不必知道。德哥派拉不過是這些人們中的一人。</p>
<p>但中國人，在這類文學家的作品裏，是要和各種所謂「土人」一同登塲的，只要看報上所載的德哥派拉先生的路由單就知道｜中國，南洋，南美。英，德之類太平常了。我們要覺悟着被描寫，還要覺悟着被描寫的光榮還要多起來，還要覺悟着將來會有人以有這様的事爲有趣。</p>
<h3>悼盧那卡爾斯基</h3>
<p>— 秀俠</p>
<p>昨閲天津某報，載有「俄文豪之哀榮」一段新聞，内云：</p>
<p>莫斯科一日電：於十二月二十六日死於法國孟丹之大文豪盧那却爾斯基之遺骸已说本日運至莫京。政府要人及盧氏親友多人，均在站迎接盧氏棺柩，莫京全市懸半旗致哀。盧氏棺柩由李維諾夫等由車站載下。又二日電：盧氏遺骸已於本日在紅塲舉行葬儀，入葬時有十萬餘民衆參加，加里寗，莫洛托夫，加干諾維支等，亦參加。敎育人民委員長布索諾夫代表政府演説，盧氏骨灰，葬於克姆林宮牆。</p>
<p>這様，現代偉大的文豪盧氏是已經死去近兩星期了，我國至今才得到這點點消息｜茲特將盧氏生平及其對學術上的貢獻略陳一二，藉表悼忱。</p>
<p>盧氏(Lunacbarski)於一八七六年，</p>
<p>生於波爾泰哇(poltava)的附近。家裏是大地主，但又有人説他於一八七八年生於基雅夫(Kiev)地方，母親是俄國人，父親是波蘭人。關於他的幼年，還很少人知道得淸楚。在他自已的著述裏，他説過七歲時，便曾將聖像抛在地上，表現無神論的思想。但他母親却是一個敎徒，希望她的兒子做牧師，結果是使她很失望。在中學畢業以後，他爲環境所限，便到國外進大學，由是知道有許多逃出的學者聚在瑞士那裏，以後他便加入了「勞働解放社」，這組織是和蒲列哈諾夫他們都有關係的。後赴巴黎，研究馬克思主義，和藝術理論，終於回到俄國，但以事被逐至伏羅格逹（Vologda）地方。經過三次的流亡，到了三月革命，才回到祖國。革命後，盧氏歷任要職。直至現在逝世，年紀也還不過五十多歲而已。</p>
<p>他的學問是很爲淵博的。從自然科學，到一切藝術的領域，他都深知熟曉。對於哲學文藝批評戲劇，他均有豐富的貢獻，而尤其是對於美學，他具有卓絶的見解。日人尾瀨敬正所作的盧氏小傳上，稱他具備各種優勝的要素，淸楚的頭腦，强壯的精神，詩人般的情緖，極敏捷的悟性，一切都是優異天才的表現。這話是很稱合的。</p>
<p>盧氏現在是未到耄耄之年便去世了，他留了巨量的著作以供後人研究。雖然他的理論曾被人淸算過，認爲不很正確，但他近幾年來已經努力矯正，這種勇於接受别人批評的虚心，是尤其値得佩服的。</p>
<p>無論如何，盧氏總是時代的先驅者，對於他的死耗，我們研究文學的人，當會認爲學術界的一種巨大的損失而深致惋惜的吧。</p>
<h3>女學校中</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>過了好半天了，學校裏没有人出入，大大的院子裏，只剩下校長和我們七個無家可歸的人死守着。院子裏，平素熱鬧慣了的，現在只剩着無限的寂靜，冷落極了：因而那秋風掃動地下落葉的聲音，都很淸晰地竄入我們的耳膜内。</p>
<p>我們的聽覺，至少在這一時，是主宰着我們的全身的，可以説無時不在凝神地諦聽着，只要有某種吵呌的聲音傳流過來，我們都會相顧失色，心跳不止的；我們怕那卽將來臨的遭遇｜｜日本兵要從長春開來代佔省城呢。</p>
<p>長春已經在兩天前讓日本兵强佔了，從任何方面説，都有繼續侵佔吉林的必要和可能，然而省城的軍事當局，在這様緊張的情况下，一點防禦的工作都没有作，自然更談不到備戰了。旣然没有軍隊迎擊日本兵，那麽省城裏只有挺着讓日本人强佔了！</p>
<p>本城的同學們，先生們，夫役們，還有離家較近的人，儘昨天一天都回到家裏去了，學校裏陷入無政府的狀態，全城呈現巨大的混亂，滿街是人，車馬，東西，東關搬到西關，江北搬到江南，還有從城裏搬到城外或是轉到鄉間去的。亂搬一陣，誰也不知道那裏是安全地帶。</p>
<p>校長的様子，比我們更要可憐，好像日本兵的眼睛專用以尋找女學校的校長用的，一來到就會先抓住他，他喪魂失魄的，臉色白白的，一個人在校長室裏無可奈何地踱着步。他也有家，可以回到家裏的，但他有職務在身，是不能放下一個空學校一走了事的。</p>
<p>我們的寢室裏，死氣沉沉的，我們的心却適得其反異常地活躍，無法平靜下去。我就想：日本兵佔過省城，定然還要佔外縣，外縣也一定没有軍隊抵抗。那一定的，我們再過一些日子就要變成像朝鮮人一様的亡國奴了。可是我終不能不連想到城裏的軍隊，爲什麽就没有動作？國家養兵是爲的禦侮抗敵的，人民納税是爲的要求國家保障的，現在日本兵眞的要佔過來，倒是一點動作没有，這算是怎麽一回事情？：：：</p>
<p>「薇，你聽！」</p>
<p>我正在痴起時，聽到有人呌我一聲，也不顧去辨别是那一個喊我，只是靜靜地聽着，不錯，像有一種微小的聲音，但是斷定不出在什麽地方。</p>
<p>過一會，聲音更大些了，「嗚：：：」</p>
<p>街面上，突然掀起更雜亂的吵鬧，喊呌聲，奔跑聲，甚而還有號哭聲，那「嗚：：：」的聲響給壓下去了。</p>
<p>「怎麽一回事？」</p>
<p>「不是進來了？」</p>
<p>我們之中有人這麽驚慌地説着，毎人的心神都跟着緊張起來，以爲大難臨頭了。逃不了，等着罷。</p>
<p>那「嗚：：：」的聲響，正在這時加大了，人的吵呌聲反到消沉下去，彷彿是從天空中傳播出來的聲音，我們跑到院心裏朝天一望，正好，是一架飛機。雖然我們從前没有看過這東西，在圖畫中倒是早就認識了，看到機身上太陽旗的標誌，我們知道是日本飛機了，這大概就是使街上人們更加重地吵呌了一陣的原故。</p>
<p>「天！」有人呌了一聲，呌了眞慘。　　正在這時，一間敎室的門，「呀」地一聲拉開了，我們把視線轉過去，開門的是我們的校長，他一面用兩手緊緊的按着頭上的帽子，一面儘速地往講桌底下藏躱，他大概是怕飛機裏的日本人看到他吧？不，他是在預防着從飛機上面抛下的炸彈，他一定以爲帽子同桌子可以替他保障身體的安全。</p>
<p>一想到炸彈，我們也感到自身的危險，飛機飛走了，可是我們的恐怖却加深了，我們想，在飛機來了以後，坐火車從長春開來的日本兵也許快到車火車站了。</p>
<p>怎麽辦呢？三天以來，毎天都擔驚受怕的，今天到底讓恐怖開了端，以後可怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>我們中國的地方，爲什麽就讓日本兵强佔呢？我們的同胞們，爲什麽就要受到日本兵的蹂躍呢？我們的生命，可到那裏去尋求保障呢？</p>
<p>想也是白想，想來想去還有得不到解答，救濟不了自身危急的處境，索興就不想了，想逃，那也不是好辦法，除非（</p>
<p>逃出人世，不然總躱不過這災難的。</p>
<p>這一來，我倒寛了心，什麽都不怕了，竟至於有閑心跑到敎室裏，從講桌底下把校長拉出來，笑着説：</p>
<p>「王校長，飛機早走了，你眞會想法子，怎不先敎給我們知道知道呢。」</p>
<p>我還在這時開他的玩笑，其實，我們都是同様的可憐人！</p>
<h3>趣喩</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>㈠</p>
<p>祗要説到「明末」，許多人是會感到頭痛的，因爲那時的材料，現在來讀，頗有些令人剌心。實際上，也並不全是如此。雖多「剌心」之事，亦不乏「開胃」之文。新年伊始，吉利爲高，所以我丢開「剌心」，來談「趣喩」。「趣喩」云者，是許多話不從正面説，許多事不從正面處理，祗是用嘻笑有趣的譬喩來説明他。明末的智識份子，最擅長這一套，眞可以説是「前無古人，後無來者」。這是明末的文學的特色之一，也是那時的客觀環境所造成的。是爲序。</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>馮琦寄楊夢山太宰書云：「今朝議復興，諸老在風波撼摇之際，而閣下方披襟散髮，臥桃花嶺上，此如振衣雲表，下視人世塵埃野馬，足一笑也。」這喩言眞是説得優美極了。「披襟散髮，」是何等神仙態度：「臥桃花嶺」，又是何等的詩人境界，無如他們看不到「塵埃」。這馬法是比我們直爽的人駡得「唯美」得多。這様的文章，纔可算得「駡人的藝術，」質之梁實秋先生與「藝風」諸君子，以爲何如？</p>
<p>㈢</p>
<p>楊循吉與人云：「予觀詩不以格律體裁而論，惟求直吐胸懷，實叙景象，婦人女子皆曉所謂者，然後定爲好詩。其他餖飣攢簇，拘拘拾古人涕唾者，亦木偶之假線索，吾無取焉」。「拾古人涕</p>
<p>唾」，這駡法是很平庸的，可是加上「餖飣攢簇」，「木偶假綫」，竟成了駡人的唯美文章，此眞趣喩矣。謹以之獻於今之「木偶之假綫索的」今之詩人，小説家，以至於雜誌編者。</p>
<p>㈣</p>
<p>李楷示兒云：「被裏作文，枕上看書，此是熟境；席上賦詩，山頭走馬，此是險事；吾生平得失之處，告兒知之」。一部人生哲學，在「被裏作文」，「山頭走馬」四隨手拾來的趣喩中，竟説得乾乾凈凈。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟　㈧㈡</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>一天早上，當他洗欶完了時，女僕約瑟芬把通知委任的信交了給他。</p>
<p>他第一個感獨是和那聽到通知减刑的死刑犯的感觸一様的；他立刻覺得自已的痛苦，給這回遠游和這寗靜的，老是被流動的海水摇蕩着的，老是飄泊着的，老是逃遁着的生活這一想念所緩和了。</p>
<p>他現在像一個沉默的謹愼的外客一様在家裏過活着。從他把他年發現的那穢濁的秘密在他的弟弟面前洩露了那晚起，他覺得自已已把和家人們的最後的關係斷絶了。他時時懊悔不該把這事告訴哲安。他自以爲是一個醜陋的，卑汚的，險惡的人，可是他却又因爲説出了這事覺得比較舒服一點。</p>
<p>他從此以後再没有和他的母親或弟弟四目相遇過。他們的眼睛採取了一種驚人的移動性和恐怕遇着的敵人般的詭計互相迴避着。他老是想：「她對哲安説了些什麽呢？她承認了呢還是否認了？我的弟弟作何感想？他覺得她怎様，覺得我怎様？」他猜不出來便因而惱怒着。他現在差不多不和他們交談了，除非是在羅蘭面前，爲着避免他的問詢。</p>
<p>當他接到通知委任信時，他當天便拿給家裏人看了。對於一切都很易感着快樂的他的父親，拍手慶賀。哲安以一種嚴肅的，但靈魂裏充滿了快樂的聲調回答：</p>
<p>「我向你掬誠道賀，因爲我知道這事是有很多競爭者的。你是一定因爲有着你的敎授們的著函才成功了的。」</p>
<p>而他的母親低着頭咕嘟道：</p>
<p>「我很高興你成功了。」</p>
<p>午飯後，他到船公司的辦事處去問明種種手續；他查到了明天就要開行的「皮加狄」郵船上的醫生的名字，以便到他身邊去請敎自已的新生活的一切委細和以後會要遇着的那些特殊情况。</p>
<p>皮來特醫生那時在船上，他走了上船，被一個和他的兄弟相像的生着金黃鬍鬚的靑年在郵船的一問小房子裏接待着。他們談了很久的話。</p>
<p>在那大船的響朗的深底裏，我們聽到一種模糊的繼續的不斷喧囂，堆進艙裏的貨物落下的聲音，和脚聲，人語，裝貨機的動作，工頭的吹哨，被蒸汽的力量｜這力量使得整個大船微微顫動起來｜曳着或捲在車盤上的鐵練的響聲等等，混成一片。</p>
<p>但當筆爾辭别了他的同行，再走回街上的時候，一種新的哀愁襲着他，並像這在海上奔馳着的，來自世界盡頭的霚氣一様包圍着他。！這不可捉摸的濃密的霚裏，是帶着有像蠻荒瘴癘之地的含有傳染性的呼吸一様的那種神秘的不潔的東西。</p>
<p>就是在他最痛苦的時候，他也從來没有感覺到像這様沉淪在苦難的陰溝裏。這是因爲最後的裂口已經做成了；他只剩孑然一身。當他從自已心裏把一切溫柔的根源挖去時，他也不曾感到這突然將他占領了的喪家之犬的窮迫。</p>

<h3>去年紗花市塲之回顧</h3>
<p>造成十年來最低紀錄</p>
<p>去年（民國二十二年）上海紗花市塲、承二十一年市况凋敝之餘氣、依然不振、蓋自九一八之後、東三省之廣大市塲以失、一二八侵滬之役作、東南市塲亦爲疲敝、而去年春初日軍首侵楡關、後奪熱河、棉紗市塲、乃大受打擊、春銷本應有一席起色、而農村破産、蠶繭失敗、鄉民困苦、購買力大爲减少、以致上海一埠存紗、約有十五萬包之譜、紗市頓現摇摇欲墜之勢、此皆日人爲之崇也、廠商鑒於局勢嚴重、基業危急、乃召集全國紗廠、討論救濟辦法、結果、議决自四月二十一日至五月二十日、全體一致减工百分之二十三、當時市塲受其激剌而稍漲、但客方實銷、依然衰落不振、仍苦供過於求、標紗由二百零五六元、直跌至一百九十元、至六七月中、美國總統羅斯福實行膨脹通貨政策、美棉有一度漲風、由六分漲至一角而至一角二分、然金市狂跌、匯兌猛升、採算銀盤、反較低廉、但棉市與紗市適成反比例、以存底日趨單薄、各路來源稀少、投機商乘機把持軋空、在陳花時代七八月間、最高至四十八九元、豈料樹大招風、我國財長宋子文賒購棉麥借欵簽字成立消息傳來、猶如靑天霹靂、一盤狂跌一元外、但買方軋空心猶未死、故棉市終較紗市爲昻、旋至九十月間、紗市步驟同入軌道、以穀稻價賤、新棉因增加三分之一、雨水調匀、收成豐茂、套賣者漸多、同時八月八日美政府估計增加、市價趨落、世界棉業一致震動、標紗市勢愈見惡劣、存紗仍難减縮、而套入倉庫之紗有二三萬包、棉市一鬆、紗市跌勢更猛銳、故在九月間、敲破一百八十元大關矣、標花低峯見三十九元四角、此時全國經濟委員會有棉業統制委員會之説、據市塲上傳聞、對於棉紗有偉大的力量維持、於是一般消息靈通者及某紗廠、聯絡大批收買、以待善沽、奄奄不振之紗價、得此大量一購、由一百七十九元漲至一百八十四五元、十月十六日、棉業統制會成立、市塲傳言紛紜、另有合興公司組織、將交易所之存紗、二萬餘包悉數收進、得此援力、市面當然穩定多日、十一月六日紗布交易所奉實業部令、爲穩定紗價起見、拒受客户新交棉紗、當時惹起極大風波、以爲賣方皆備實貨、並非空手投機、如果不能交貨、祗得向市塲抵補、市面當飛漲如何程度、經紀人亦以契約關係不肯接受、於是空氣異常緊張、停市三日、理事晋京請願、後得變通辦法、再行開市、對於買方增收特金二十二元、然投機者視風勢不利皆不敢貿然舉動、在十一月上旬間、毎日拍開空盤甚多、至十一月二十日閩浙風雲突變、使紗市前途重受大打擊、以華紗最大主顧獨持華南一隅、一旦發生軍事行動、銷塲將歸絶望也、一般現貨商更形恐慌、由此執貨者祗得羣向期貨市塲套賣、除此别無出路、裂痕顯現、跌風隱伏、某大廠亦受經濟牽制、無意收貨、據市塲傳聞、棉統會亦棄不收貨、有此大量的籌碼吐出、乃如决堤崩潰、一瀉千里、一日間跌去四五元、至十二月七日、跌破七十元大關、造成十年以來之新低峯、（按標紗自開拍以來、以民國十一年十月二日本月份之一百二十一兩九錢爲最低、此時標紗、係十六支人鐘紗等級、低十二元五角、不過以前之價、連派司二兩八錢四、）交易所在此標紗猛跌之中、爲應付穩重計、對於增加特别證金、歷次之多、爲交易所開始以來所未聞也、交易所標紗、全年成交共計九百七十萬零三千六百五十包、比去年增四百二十六萬六千九百五十包、標花成交二千四百三十三萬九千三百担、比去年增九百七十三萬八千担、</p>
<h3>糧食廠家收進近期粉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初穩繼平之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回好二三角左右、坎拿大好近角、故初開時、各月份聲氣、略見堅定、較前日收價、好起半分、旋以各月份交易、甚見淸淡、客帮旣少動靜、業外亦無投機活動、市况又見平淡、六月份最低回至二元零九分二厘半、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、更見淸寂、六盤袛六七萬包之出入、惟廠家則收進近期、各月份遂爲抬起、較上午回好一分外、結果本月份較好七厘半、二月份好七厘半、三月份好五厘、四月份好七厘半、五六月份各好一分、</p>
<h3>期麥空盤居多</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、微呈穩象、因洋麥報價、好一角至二三角不等、市塲人心、未免稍佳、不過各月份交易、實在淸淡、各盤空拍居多、殊無出入、此種情形、完全因結賬關係、致多停手不做也、結果本月份較前日好二分、三月份小一分、餘均無比較、現麥見交尙暢、行家收進之標凖、已陸續起開、計瑶　麥開四元、蚌埠麥開三元九角九分、共三千包、由福新申大辦去云、</p>
<h3>晚稻銷呆續跌六七分</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍有五十餘號、計七千餘石、其中又以晚稻居多、包胃去路、南北洋兩帮祗一千五六百包、故人心異常懈淡、行情卒落六七分、本街店胃則以寒雨綿綿、作客不多、市價亦跌去數分至近尺、厚粳亦然、杜洋尖貨乏仍無軒輊、陰變元猶無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到貨二十五六號、市上各種銷胃因天宮晨雨、至千稍上、買方上市寥寥、去路全無、昨日所解之貨、均爲隔日做定、市上做開無幾、市價與前相仿、</p>
<h3>秈米存積甚厚</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、形勢尙稱活潑、惟市上存貨十多萬包、再有鉅量洋米、各帮貨主均有趕早了結、以資年底結束之意、去路並未增加、本客雖有辦意、然均扣緊應酬、並不放價暢辦、囤户多改辦河下各米、且向内地與産區採辦糙米與稻穀等、以備久貯、市面仍見求過於供、行情依然居平軟矣、惟貨主雖欲求脫、行情亦不肯十分低落、昨市售開各價與前市相似、計由本街辦去江西機晚一百十二包、價七元一角、湖南機油三百包、價七元二角半至七元一角九分、福州帮辦去湖南機靖一百包、價六元半、砶靖四百二十五包、價五元九角至五元七角半、又紅糙一百五十包、價五元五角五分至五元五角二分、其他均無售開、惟閩帮胃口甚濃、今後時局稍定、必有整批去化、</p>
<h3>糖市　新片靑又降三角</h3>
<p>成交千七百餘件</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢疲弱、仍無轉機之象、公會劃盤二四粗砂劃十九元零五分、比前日小去五分、但出户甚缺、其勢如無意外變動、當可轉定也、轉口貨較高者劃六元四角、八號荷赤呌十五元二角、太古糖呌原價、尙防續小、本廠綿白振記一號仍開十八元一角、其餘二三四號逐檔照退、漳刁靑到貨　稀、濟南輪僅一百三十餘包、照市均須虧耗、客意望好、無如潮靑源源有到、爲數且旺、昨乏開出、未易樂觀耳、廣潮帮又開出片靑一千七百餘箱、價爲八元五角、比前又跌三角、</p>
<h3>閳北貨</h3>
<p>興化圓到貨突增</p>
<p>桂圓自閩變以來、除厦門因有外輪照常有到、惟興化泉州兩處爲避免危險起見、華輪均停開、上月曾有立生租有外輪神佑號、開往興泉、昨已返申、查興泉桂圓共到五千餘件、蓋該處防遭池魚之殃、遂紛紛運申、其中興化貨佔五分之一云</p>
<h3>油市　荳油連電突漲四角</h3>
<p>｜本埠亦跟起三角｜</p>
<p>豆油市向依連電漲落爲轉移、若連電步告慘跌、本市油情亦一蹶不振、昨連電現油突漲四角、「期油亦漲·請參觀市價欄、」致一般人心浮動、且存貨在跌價中走枯、故市面提高亦速、比較前盤足漲三角、計成交輪連豆油一百件、價開十元零七角、路貨五百件、十元零三角、輪連歧油五十件、十元零五角、路貨二百五十件、十元零三角半云、</p>
<h3>五金　新鐵品絡繹裝來</h3>
<p>新鐵品若三角鐵·洋元條·竹節鋼·洋板·洋方等貨、前昨二日浦東及浦西各洋棧裝到不少、（查數約有二千餘噸之譜）、各市標凖、在此結束期内、則少升高之望、</p>
<h3>烟皮鐵零星生意尙旺</h3>
<p>烟皮鐵近來零星生意十分興旺、本街熱水瓶廠·搪磁廠·鐵廠等、均有點綴、行情三尺六尺每擔開十元零五角、二尺六尺毎擔開十一元五角、（</p>
<p>（以上正號貨、）副號貨三尺六尺十元零二角半、二尺六尺十一元云、</p>
<h3>九十磅美馬口鐵現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>九十磅美馬口鐵、現貨近來十分軋缺、客帮廠家雖有交易、但均有無貨可購之概、行情毎箱估十五元四角、（無鐵壳）、及十五元八角、（有鐵壳）、比前漲上二角、</p>
<h3>靑鉛市仍不振</h3>
<p>靑鉛市面、近仍閑散、雖到貨不踴、然交易亦少、故行情無甚進展、毎担仍開十六元一二角、土鉛則祗售十五元七八角、交易則本街印書房錫紙廠等微有點綴、黃丹廠·油漆公司等殊甚冷落、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>華絲美銷依然衰落</p>
<p>紐約綢廠絲銷大减、世界經濟不安、絲綢銷路呆滯、紐約各綢廠去歲營業備受虧蝕、存貨山積、去冬工潮雖告解决、而機車祗開十之五六、生絲銷用大减、日昨本埠乾利洋行接得紐約絲業公會報、上月（卽去歲十二月）份紐約全市各綢廠共計銷用生絲二萬六千九百五十九包、前月（十一月）份爲三萬五千九百四十四包、較减八千九百八十五包、</p>
<p>繭衣三十五担運湖内地剝棉客邇來對於白繭衣續有需求昨瑞記絲頭號計有無錫白繭衣三十五担、裝往湖屬平湖、</p>
<p>人造絲市續呈平疲昨本埠人造絲市續呈平疲、杭綢廠進劉海金鷹寳塔等牌一、二月份百磅箱、期貨三十五箱、價目二百零八元五角至一百九十二元二角半凈盤、</p>
<p>華洋絲商仍趨擯持歐美生絲市塲、絲銷仍無轉機、紐約各絲織廠存絲足敷需求、里昻綢廠則隨用隨購、日絲充斥、開價仍廉、華絲廠銷均仍呆滯、滬埠各歐莊咸持價小方購主旨、華絲商虧本太鉅、市氣續呈擯持、昨祗英莊等續有點品交易、計安利等進黃白高經十四包、價仍平疲、</p>

<h3>經濟道德</h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>過了新年，寒暑表的溫度越降低了，馬路上的西北風也愈刮愈厲了，前夜本埠不是已見了雪花呀？擋有我們面前的，又將是一大堆嚴寒冰冷的日子！　　有錢的人，當然不會想到嚴寒的苦楚的，他們出門的時候会的是「不通風」的汽車，在家的時候，有的是暖洋洋的電爐；可是勞苦的大衆郤仍是蹈冰履霜，耐着寒冷不斷地做着工。</p>
<p>自然，勞苦的人們不免也貪羡富人安逸的生活，而自嘆命薄；也許更會發着這様的牢騒：「現在眞是一個金錢主義的世界，有金錢的便是社會上最尊貴的人，没有錢的便是最低賤的人。」</p>
<p>是的，這句話也許是不錯的，因爲事實正是如此。</p>
<p>俗諺道：「千金之子，坐不垂堂。」一般的財主賴着祖宗的餘蔭，擁了許多的田地股票，就靠着領息分紅，得有種種收入，度他悠閒的歲月，社會那個不尊敬他，可是他郤不曾費了一毫半絲的氣力，爲國家社會勞動的。</p>
<p>事實雖然如此，不過如果用現代的經濟道德的眼光來觀察，這些人無論過的怎様豐富美滿的生活，郤是道德上最劣等階級的人物！</p>
<p>反之，一般勞苦的男女，每天刻苦作工，得了低微的工資，僅够維持他們最低限度的生活，或甚至還不免挨飢受餓，他們誠哉是貧窮困苦，就經濟道德上説他們郤是最高尙最可尊敬的。</p>
<p>日本的經濟學家福田德三説：「：：：天地間的物，都是有力的，但是有力不出，也没有用：所以天地間萬物的存在，必要將力拿出來、才能維持。」又説：「：：：許多握有土地或有價　券的人，家有牛馬成羣，收入則數千元乃至數萬元不等、然而這種人，多是毫不勞動的人。而在共同勞苦之可憐的一家；他們所用的錢，卽令一絲半毫，都是他們血汗的結果，就社會全體説，雖不過稍　的貢獻，然而積少成多，他們的功勞郤是不少，較之坐擁厚資一事不爲的，其人格究竟高尙。」</p>
<p>現在社會的混亂，可以説多半是由於這種經濟道德的缺乏。家擁巨萬的資本家不必説了，就是中産階級以下的人們，心理上也多充滿着徼倖投機的觀念，而不肯切實地自食其力，安於貧窮。我們如果單就本埠統計一下專事投機營利以及借債度日的人，怕一定可以得到驚人的數目吧。</p>
<p>現在的世界完全是以經濟爲中心的，因此我們的行動想想自然應當不背現代經濟的原理，但經濟的原理並不呌我們「拜金」，它呌我們應當遵守經濟的道德。所以，我們最高貴的勞苦的人們呀，我們不要貪羡這種寄生蟲的生活，我們不要存着徼倖投機的心理。我們當以自已的血汗爲社會服務，養活自已；忍着飢，耐着寒，好好的爲學努力，充實自已的力量吧！</p>
<h3>脆薄的雪人遇到了强烈的日光</h3>
<p>— 義璋</p>
<h3>春夢</h3>
<p>— 易</p>
<p>｜日記摘錄｜</p>
<p>昨夜臨睡時誤服多量的金鷄納霜，藥力猛，頭腦膨脹殊不舒服，且不容易睡覺，甚悔自已亂吃藥。</p>
<p>然而，睡後卽夢，夢卽醒，醒後睡又夢，至天亮的時候共夢三四回。而毎一回的夢，都有構造的故事，實在奇怪。天亮以後，知道夢是多吃金鷄納霜之故，想着要告訴世人：假如要求夢，最好吃多量的金鷄納霜。</p>
<p>第一夢：｜｜醒的時候，回味還很淸楚，此則已經記不起了，殊可惜！</p>
<p>第二夢：似乎在故鄉｜又似乎不是故鄉而　另在一塊什麽地方　的水邊　那渡頭的地方，泥潭裏有一個靡大的動物在打臥着，牠的旁邊的灘頭有狗兒與烏鴉要去爭食，岸上有人在爭着看，我也在岸上看看。心裏只是在看熱鬧，並没有其他的感想。忽然一隻好像什麽獸｜一時記不起那是呌什麽名字，但心裏總存着曉得那是什麽獸｜像馬又像虎的，牠的前脚又像兩隻人的手，從泥潭裏提出那打臥着的動物的後脚要將牠的身體扯成兩片。那動物勃然而起，呌了一聲，有人説，「人熊，人熊｜　」人跑，我也跑，那人熊却追上岸來，而且現在只是追我一人，這怎麽了得？自已脚下儘管跑，不知道怎麽跑到一塊地方，前面是一個小半島的地形，三面環水，完全絶境，我心裏决定不對，停住，可是人們帶嘻笑地喊着我，我向山坡跑，回頭一看，那人熊在那半島形的地方在撩牙舞爪。我急跑入那好像市内的地方，一個大漢指手劃脚地説，「那人熊眞利害｜某某上前一撲，力量差不多」。我的腦膜上立刻就如銀幕一様浮現出那位某某（是我認識的一位拳師）正和人熊角力的一塲面。可是心魂未定地還是跑，跑到一塊地方聽見有人説，「假的呢，是人裝的｜」忽然在許多人包圍之下看見一個土窟，裏頭那「人熊」頭戴一頂大斗笠，兩手反剪的縛着在掙扎。心想眞像人熊呢。看他臉上好像火燒了的焦黑，同時感覺到似乎他被人用火燒過。一怔便醒轉來了。</p>
<p>這是什麽象徵呢？醒轉來後便在思索着。一時雖然想不出，可是心裏總以爲是一個什麽象徵。</p>
<p>第三夢：在一個游藝會的後臺｜什麽游藝會此時已記不淸，｜人雜亂着。我向前臺出來，一看，臺前的一塊空地，圍着擠滿了人，而都是站着的在擁擠。右邊的人羣裏頭，忽然一個黑衣大漢指着一個穿西裝的靑年揚聲地向後臺的職員問道：「他是不是你們這裏的職員？我的叔父｜不知道他爲什麽也在那裏｜喝着説，「陳XX？拉倒。」我朝那邊望過去，那黑衣大漢露出手槍在扭住他，手槍從後面伸到他的前胸按住恐嚇他。我不知道爲什麽，怕殃及似地急向左邊跑，進了一間廠廳，我的叔父穿着正月初一過新年才穿的長袍馬褂兒站在走廊上大聲地説，「一瓶鼻烟拿不到，就來搗亂！」我看那西裝靑年垂頭喪氣地坐在旁邊的椅子上，臉上都是血漬，很明顯地是被那黑衣大漢打過了的，我心裏明白了是爲着一瓶鼻烟的事，不禁大惱駡道：「爲了一瓶鼻烟，何必這様呢」？又同情他似地説：「偸鼻烟不算犯罪，比方我們讀書人到書店裏頭去偸書一様，犯什麽罪呢？」可是説着立刻感覺到好像侮辱了自已便走開了。</p>
<p>到了外面｜是在馬路上｜忽然有人向我攔腰抱住喝聲「着」，我心裏一驚，不問情由，用力避開，㧞脚就跑。那人在追着。心裏好像遇着了仇人一様的恐慌。跑到鄉下籬笆旁邊，轉變的地方迎頭走來的就是幾個好朋友，看他們摩拳擦掌，大有帮助之勢，我大聲地呌打，回頭一拳便把那人打倒在地下，「打死他，滅了跡丨」大家喊着。我用一種什麽金屬的利器向那人的頭頂上毆下。大家一看，那人原來是我們的鄰人！我指着他數他的罪狀，説他的父兄如大哥五哥，怎麽同我要好，你現在變心要害我？他好像悔過似地説着一些可憐的話，並且更正了我説的他五哥是二哥。我不禁同情起來，不顧打死他，要他快走。自已也就醒轉來了。腦裏還有想着，如果他找了多的人來報復，豈不是糟糕？</p>
<p>眞是奇夢｜我要打死人？然而在那人要害我的時候，我不打死他却被他害了，｜我不料在夢中也是不能够實行「長期抵抗」的新道德。</p>
<h3>月</h3>
<p>— 綠蒂</p>
<p>我不是詩人，但對於皎潔的月是那様愛纞。我往往能獨自依着臥房的窗檯痴望着她以致於成了習慣而患失眠症。</p>
<p>那是在故鄉的時候，已是五年以前了。</p>
<p>我和弟弟的臥房是在住宅的最後進。開了東向的窗在月夜，出崗後的一抹樹林，模糊地迎風飄蕩，那様疏疏的舞姿。天止没有雲，明明的月兒照耀着整</p>
<p>個靜穆的鄉村，你可以忘懷一切忘懷人生的苦痛。</p>
<p>靑天，醉人的和風吹拂着。夏天，田中閃耀着星星的螢火。秋天，雖然比較最蕭煞的節令；然而天高氣淸，月明如畫，你不會感覺衰老的悲哀的。冬天，白的光映着白的樹林，白的屋子，白的田疇，白的柴薺，自身或者也能被目前的景物溶化了變成白的石膏像。</p>
<p>已是五年以前了，我不由得喊一聲光陰過得眞快啊！</p>
<p>投身到都市的抱懷中來，我不再瞧見一回月亮，五年以來。</p>
<p>上海的天是那末小，無論從小樓窗内望出去，或是站立在三層晒臺上，那末小的一角，於是瞧不見星星瞧不見月亮。</p>
<p>上海的世界是没有夜的，恐怕晚上反較白晝光明｜在表面上看來；，電炬那様地耀眼，電紅燈那様地迷人。雖然我每天歸來的時候，總在午夜，然而我瞧不見星星，瞧不見月亮。五年以來。</p>
<p>除夕的晚上，與三個朋友在寒風中從北四川路歸來，各人埋着頭走路，踏着自已忽長忽短的人影是那様謹愼，像悲悼一九三三的瞬息卽逝。</p>
<p>走過淸靜的馬路，上差的巡捕無精打彩的靠在大玻璃櫃旁，垂着頭，對於我們過路人毫不關心。走過熱鬧的街道，有聖誕老人的蹟跡，有爵士的歌聲，對於我們過路人像被遺棄了似的，我們始終低着頭，誰都不注意自已的同伴，或者那個聚餐給了毎人難言的隱痛。</p>
<p>同伴到了他們的家，點點頭和我分别了。我像忘了現在睡眠的時候，黃包車夫殷勤的招呼，我没有望他們一眼埋着頭自顧走路。</p>
<p>已是午夜，馬路上没有行人，風剌骨的吹着。我偶然仰起頭來長長的呼一口氣，我不信｜懸在我頭頂的是五年來不見的月亮。</p>
<p>她别來無恙，那般的皎潔，那般的光輝，她多情的從北四川路送我到家裏，｜甚至牠五年來没有間斷過追隨在我的左右。</p>
<p>月啊，五年來你没有改變你的態度</p>

<h3>關於「談職業」</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>我自了「談話」裏面一篇「文炳」君的「談職業」的文章之後，覺得那篇文章裏面的意識，有點糢糊，其中主要的論據，也太離開了現實的社會生活；所以我寫了一篇「服務至上主義」的文章，指出服務至上主義｜敬業，樂業，恒業｜在全世界都陷於無業失業的恐慌下的今日，是一種近於開玩笑的自欺欺人之談。</p>
<p>我要指摘這種自欺欺人之談的動機，那很簡單：在改造，改革中國的機運的努力差不多停息了的今日，我們年靑的人是負有掃盪一切足以蒙惑社會意識的瞹昩觀念的責任的，絶非如文炳君所謂是一種「盛氣凌人」的漫駡。</p>
<p>然而，「文炳」君文有一篇長文答覆我，而且堅持着他底「正確的理論」，説：「純粹以畸形的事實，來推翻我那篇的理論，却又并未指出我的理論上的錯誤」（「文」君原文）。這裏第一着就要請問：據文君的邏輯方法邏輯起來，是不是畸形的事實，還是畸形的事實，「文」君的理論仍然，是文君的理論？事實與理論，是可不要聯繫的麽？</p>
<p>又據「文」君的解釋：「：：我的那篇文章，是探索光明的，是跨過這畸形的現階段，而是針對着我們所希求的社會與合理的職業而言」。（「文」君原文）那第二着就要請問：「畸形的現階段」是能跨過的嗎？没有現實的社會内容的理論，卽揚棄擺在眼前的實生活而閉着眼睛對着「所希求的社會（？）與合理的職業（？）而言」的理論，那理論的眞確性呢，那理論的實踐性呢？</p>
<p>「文」君確是一個「不甘停駐在這畸形的死亡的現階段」的靑年。「文」君在「談職業」一文的結語寫着：「我所希望的是已有職業的與正在謀職業而有把握的朋友，都能澈底的認淸職業的要義及其重要，不要漫意輕忽」。「文」君在該文的前面説了一大堆敬業，樂業，恒業的大道理，在結語中又像一個説敎師一般叮嚀着有職業找職業的朋友，不可漫意輕忽；這裏第三着就要請問：「在這畸形的死亡的現階段」裏面，那一個有職業可敬，可樂，可恒？如其没有，那末，「文」君爲什麽要那様誠懇地叮嚀、敎人不可漫意輕忽？是不是文君這様的叮嚀又是跨過了這畸形的現階段以後的話呢？那要請「文」君再來一個申明。</p>
<p>「文」君説畸形的事實，不能推翻他的「正確的理論」。那末，請「文」君自已舉出此日此時此地的正常的事實作爲他那「正確的理論」的根據吧。不過我認爲整個的畸形社會裏，儘是一些㈠不能顧及自已的「興趣」，㈡才力不「配稱」，㈢於社會不見得有「貢獻」反而是「有害」的（恰和「文」君理論中的三個基本條件相反）一類的事實，而且有的速不顧興趣，不顧才力，不顧於社會有益或有害的職業也找不到手的事實，不知多少，睜開眼睛一自，這社會不是一幅大家都在搶奪飯碗的血圖嗎？在這大家爭奪之中，奶子長的就是娘！「文」君的理論如果是正確的，就應該看到了這個事實，而不會是那様針對着那個「敬業恒」三個字的幻影説那迷人的「人才適當職業，職業適當人才」的夢囈。</p>
<p>現在這個社會是無業可談，這是鐵的事實。所以「文」君隨卽申明是誇過現段階而談「未來」那個社會裏的職業。這個我不用再批評，因爲未來的社會的組織是什麽形態，仍是現有的形態、或是另一形態，我不能預知如若是另一形態的社會的話，那就根本無所謂個人的職業，集圑的在社會的需要之下參加某一種生産部門的工作，社會的需要决定了個人的工作，「文」君的大理論｜敬樂恒，根本違反了那個時代的精神，若果現在這個形態的社會仍然是未來社會的形態的話，自然「文」君的理論，是有人賞識的，事實是如此，現在那一個公司或商店的老闆們不希望他們的夥計忠實於職業，誰不願他們的夥計，抱着「敬業恒」的宏願以終其身。「文」君説：「可是有些更論就不是這様死板，而是倡導出新的事實的」，這所謂倡導出來的新的事實（指「文」君的理論），我便作這様解。</p>
<p>我只是説明「文」君的「談職業」是談不通的，别没有個人的意氣存雜其間，有機會攀駕，自當「刮目相看」。</p>

<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>這年頭，做一個智識份子眞不易，不獨下筆難，卽看也難。翻開報紙或雜誌，總會碰到上面幾個符號或是空白，使你如讀「天書」。</p>
<p>最近在天津國聞週報上看到沈從文所著的「記丁玲女士」，文中到處是「Ｘ」</p>
<p>，最多處竟有連下二三十個Ｘ者。但用Ｘ處往往是極關緊要處，正如報紙上的空白處，並不是記者先生打了磕睡，忘記寫下；反之，此中却躍躍有事，呼之欲出。於是讀者就不得不用讀易經卦ＸＸ的方法，從那極簡單的符號中去推求他所要知道的消息。所推求出來的消息，雖不盡中，要亦相差不遠，至少至少是讀者的程度是由此提高了。</p>
<p>有人説，這是文學上最高的表現法。在舊的文評中，不是有所謂『不着一字，盡得風流』的語句嗎？證之佛敎哲學，此語更信。靈山會上，我佛拈花微笑，五百弟子獨有迦葉心會，於是遂傳衣鉢，創立了禪宗。大概世間最偉大處，便是無言。因爲凡百名相，一落言詮，便失眞諦，故嬰兒被稱爲最偉大的詩人。冰心女士詩云：</p>
<p>嬰兒·是最偉大的詩人，</p>
<p>在他不完全的言語中，</p>
<p>吐出最完全的詩句。（大意如此，　　原文已忘。）</p>
<p>這是能够領略到文字以外的意味的但此種聰明，也是「古已有之」的，並不算是特創，不過現在更適用得普遍一點罷了。且抄一則前人的筆記，算作本文的結尾。</p>
<p>淸梁紹主兩般秩雨盦隨筆卷二圈兒信條云：『有妓致書於所歡，開緘無一字，先畫一圈，次畫一套圈，次連畫數圈，次又畫一圈，次畫兩圈，次畫一圓圈，次畫半圈，末畫無數小圈。有好事者題一詞於其上云：「相思欲記從何記？畫個圈兒替。話在圈兒外，心在圈兒裏。我密密加圈，你須密密知儂意。單圈兒是我，雙圈兒是你；整圈兒是圑圓，破圈兒是别離。還有那説不盡的相思，把一路圈兒圈到底。」無中生有，令人忍俊不禁。』</p>

<h3>父債</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>鄙人現年二十八歲，四歲時，家父病故。忽於前年有某姓者，持有家父在日，具名出立之借票一張，並附田單三張；計押借洋一百元。從立票之年月起，距今已三十六年。票上居間人，亦已謝世。今年該姓央人前來，欲取回本銀及至少與出銀相同之利息。如其置而不問。並以法律解决爲恫嚇。但鄙人自幼到今：據家母云。此項田地，原是我家産業；嗣以家父在世時，迫於經濟，早已售脫。家父故世後，該姓亦未到過我家，咨照索討。迨後鄙人長而結婚，該姓亦從未話起。現在鄙人家境淸苦，生活艱難，卽使有此錢債糾葛，亦難淸償；况此種不明不白，相隔如許歲月，費人思索之難題乎。鄙人年幼無知，不諳世事，再四思維，實無辦法。</p>
<p>先生社會救星，幸祈不吝指示，應以何種方法對付？且該項糾葛，相隔幾十年之久，法律上究屬生效否？曷勝感激。敬祝</p>
<p>撰祺　陸振謹上</p>
<p>編者按：這個問題，陸君應索閲該項借據，看牠是不是出於尊大人的嫡筆？一個人的筆據，是眞是假，爲其子者，應當有鑒别的能力；否則亦可與其他確知其爲眞實者相比照。人的字跡，各不相同，一經比照，眞僞立判；倘使是假的，當然不成問題；如其是眞的，那麽三十六年，尙不能認爲失却時效。至於你父親死後，不來追索，也是常有的事；人家念你們孤兒寡婦，不來催索；迨後你雖長大成人，但尙羽毛未豐，不爲已甚。這多是他們用情之處，豈可據以否認這宗債務哉？至於你現在家境淸寒，生活艱難，對於父債，無力償付，乃是另一問題。現行法律，雖有限制繼承的規定，可惜公佈在你父親死後許多年的現在，致不能引用。不過對方，也自有其手續欠缺的地方：該項債務，原以田産爲抵押，那麽對方對於此項被指爲抵押品的田産，應予十分注意。尊大人在日，將此項田産脫售時，對方應立卽出而交涉，卽令當時彼此交誼頗深，不欲深究，也應當要求尊大人立據申明，另指抵押。現在此種手續，均付缺如，使人致疑於當時該項債務，或竟已經淸料；其所以未將借據收回者，容或當時曾經有申明遺失，立據收淸等一類的手續。所以我們以爲此事以和解爲上策，酌量償還若干，將借據收回，永絶後患。爲了一二百元的債務，涉訟公庭，是不合算的；何况這起糾紛，並不是一二庭可以審結的呢！</p>

<h3>獄中記（六）</h3>
<p>— 車輪</p>
<p>十四日</p>
<p>候運動塲乾候了幾天，在我們的經騐中知道已乾了一二天，有被提去運動的希望，飯後我換了雙皮鞋焦急的等待着敲大鼓的來帶，我敲敲牆問隔壁的皮君有没有來帶出去運動的可能。</p>
<p>「我何險，老張，今天太陽這怎好，昨天前天大前天也好，塲是乾了｜我保險來提你運動好了！」</p>
<p>確實我被雨困怕，牆壁困怕，靑天祇能見到窗子那麽大，雖則在哲學家看來窗框内也包含着無限，但在犯人不要這様的無限，他要左右上下望出去無限碍的以眼去吻接一切柔軟的碧綠，無窮無盡的碧綠。眼睛只有這個簡單的要求　　脊柱骨，腿，膀，像給屋脊壓住壓得酸而扁曲和約束小了，它們僅僅只要在幾天中得到幾分鐘離開這小室去受監視的自由｜運動。</p>
<p>它們想要像肺要飽呼一口淸潔似的只要活動它們顫動它們一下｜只這個小小的要求，像狗睡倦了站起來摇摇它身體般的要求。</p>
<p>大概不止我一個人在祈求帶運動者來像望神來，却這神偏不是普度衆生的神。</p>
<p>飯後的一小時以後，皮君敲了敲牆｜我那時正在來來回回的踏脚走，隨卽我集中了聽覺站定了步，因爲聲音是只有在裝電燈的牆頂的牆洞裏傳過來。</p>
<p>「不保險了，老張｜靠不住了！」</p>
<p>皮不説靠不住我也絶望了，因爲他來祇有在剛剛飯後的幾分鐘來，往往有</p>
<p>幾個飯量大些的飯碗還没離開手他就來開號子門提出去運動了。一小時後就没有希望，其實這倒反是可以運動的時間。在剛剛吃好就去跑步常使人的肚子抖動到痛。他是不管的。</p>
<p>十六日</p>
<p>今天又落雨了，在天好的時候我們一直没有希望到運動。以後又活要幾時了。</p>
<p>二十二日</p>
<p>那天僅僅落了些毛毛雨，怕地都不致灦透，却一隔幾天到今天才運動，却五分鐘不到就完了，他説因爲我們的秩序不好。但天哪，怎麽才能秩序好哪？</p>

<p>電影專刊</p>
<h3>美國某電影雜誌所發的嚴重警告</h3>
<p>— 開羅</p>
<p>各種電影競賽所造成之失望</p>
<p>無知無識靑年女子居其多數</p>
<p>美國電影界製片家，無時無刻不在尋求新的人才。他們在普天下搜索着，在上中下三等人物中尋覓着。他們用盡了心血與金錢，發起了無數種的競賽，以爲拔取眞材的途徑。這是不是美國女界的好消息？有人說是的，但是美國的MotionPicture，在正月號中已經發出了嚴重的警告。記者讀了裏面的内容，亦有些驚心動魄，現在且將那雜誌發出警告的原因，以及各種競賽的實在情形，約略叙述一下。</p>
<p>總而言之，好萊塢的魔力太大了，使全國女子都受了它的誘惑，脫離了家庭，抛棄丈夫子女，釀成種種慘案。大家都存了做電影明星的希望，等到事實上辦不到，就由失望而墮落，而自殺。而這種轟動全國的競賽，尤其是製造失望悲慘的開端。你要是一時勝利了，至終或許還是要失敗；倘使你失敗了，那你就永久失敗了，並且喪失了一切的希望，金錢與家庭。因此，稍爲曉得些電影事業的内容的，不得不向普天下的友子，發出一種警告：「最好是不要踏入是非之塲，走上毁滅之路；不然的話，應當前瞻後顧，不要一刻忘記出路的所在，以便隨時作急流勇退之計」。</p>
<p>據好來塢最近的統討，以往十二個月之中，各電影公司所發起的各種競賽，一共多至一百九十二次。競賽勝利者有二千一百人，曾受聘到好萊塢；而相近勝利，自已出貲去到好萊塢的，總有好幾倍。美國女子加入這許多競賽的，人數在一千一百萬以上，而全世界的人數，總有二千八百萬之譜。有一次競賽，竟吸引了四百六十四萬個女子。其中以中等城市報名的最多。如納希維爾一個地方，報名的竟逹二萬三千四百人之多。所以這様看來，美國經過了這許多次電影競賽之後，一定有幾千萬失望的與賽者！</p>
<p>各種競賽的名稱，眞是五花八門，可以提得起名稱的，至少有二三十種。但是結果，往往尋不到一個需要的人才，祗可以將幾個出類拔萃的美貌女子，請到好萊塢去遊歷一趟，然後再資遣回籍。在這一方面，恐怕上海人還没有忘記去年外國人亦曾在中國發起個一次競賽。結果如何，恐怕到現在還没有一個交代哩。不過當時中國女子參加的並不多，失望的當然也不甚重要，因爲中國女子到底還没中那個明星熱，很少肯傾家蕩産，入棄家庭去尋求機會的。但是美國女子的思想就有些超越常軌了。</p>
<p>這種競賽之中，最不幸的一件事，就是受吸引的人，普通都是小城市，學校裏的，比較的無知無識的靑年女子。他們從來没有和社會接觸過，所以没有嘗試過失望的滋味。他們没有吃苦的凖備，等到他們發現他們野心大於經騐的時候，往往不堪打擊，而走入一蹶不振的道道。祗要翻開報紙來看一看，就可以看到許多「尋人」的小廣告，若再細細地讀下去，就可以發現妻子失踪哩；她瞞了丈夫去加入美女競賽，失望之後，就一去不返了，還有競賽告終之後，就有許多自殺案發生；警察方面，受父母的請求尋覓他們的子女的，不計其數，探其原因，一部份亦都歸罪於電影公司的各種競賽。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「玉殿藏春」</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>DieFledermaus</p>
<p>電影的宣傳效果，旣然爲世人所公認。但是有一部份人是故意不承認電影，乃至於一切藝術的宣傳性的。一方面他們却儘量製作宣傳片，所謂宣傳片自然不限於宣傳某種政治主張的正面影片，卽使那種催眠着他們所需要催眠的人，麻醉着他們所需要麻醉的人的影片，他們同様努力製作，自然，效果是并不壞於他們的正面宣傳的。一方面他們又可以不居宣傳影片和藝術的政治性之名。『玉殿藏春』之爲這類的影片，是顯而易見了。</p>
<p>很多人估量着這種宮幃中粉香脂膩的影片，都只是有閑者的消閑品，然而實際上，這種估計，是不够的。</p>
<p>一般的說，歐洲電影界製作宮幃片之類，是較之美國製片者容易得至效果的。因爲美國太年靑，而宮幃片等等故事和佈景，又都是過去時代的。所以美國的製片者都不很熟悉，一方面因爲美國最近代化的經濟組織的形態電影的表現手法，也同様的較適合於表現現代的男女糾紛，而不很適宜於宮幃故事。卽以『玉殿藏春』而論，他的佈景鏡頭，較之美國片一般的古老與緩漫，而這古老和緩漫無疑的中更逼眞，更適合於這一種影片。</p>
<p>卽以導演而論，他是非常注意分量的均匀，尤其是叙述中心故事的旁襯，這様觀衆得到的感覺，就非常的豐富與舒泰。當然，這豐富與舒泰，并不是指多餘和鬆懈而言。</p>
<p>演員的表現，在故事的决定之下，自然也不會像美國片中的跳浪和浮游。　　總之，假使我們想看一些歐洲電影的舊藝術的話，在這張『玉殿藏春』中，是看得到的。</p>
<h3>評『瓊島風雲』</h3>
<p>— 凌鹤</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在這裏，我祗能寫出一點感想。</p>
<p>冬天，給與人們一種可怕的感覺，灰白色的雲層高壓在我們頭上，冷酷的空氣，緊緊縛紥着我們的心胸，使我們幾乎失了呼吸的本能。我懷着沉痛的感覺在冷風中掙扎着。我想：前幾天下了一層白雪，當然在這幾天以内，也許還有更可怕的白色呈現在我們眼前。然而一想到冬天過了，馬上便是春天的到臨，這給與我們一種極歡樂的新鮮的希望。一想到這裏，便增加了我極大的勇氣。好的，且掙扎着罷，可愛的春天，總會降臨到人間。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>『瓊島風雲』正在這冷酷的冬天開映，格外使戲院的空氣嚴肅得可怕。</p>
<p>我極力忍耐着沉悶的情懷，看完了官製的新聞片之後，又看完了這一部極庸俗不通的『瓊島風雲』，我深深的惋惜電影藝術給人們無理由的毁滅。假使電影，這東西，在中國就這様糟踏下去，那末，朋友們，請想想罷！我們將必然的否認電影之眞價存在。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>電影這東西，始終有其在藝術上的眞價，特别是在這狂風暴雨的年頭，在這無論誰都感覺藝術饑渴的時候，我們更應當維護電影在藝術上的尊嚴。</p>
<p>但是像『瓊島風雲』這類的影片，在藝術上的眞價，却完全給人們毁滅無餘，而完全成爲宣傳品，這是極其可鄙的地方。老實說，中國觀衆絶對不需要這種毫無理由的宣傳。在這國亡無日的時候，「安内而後攘外」的言詞，我們已經聽得够了。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>再說罷，電影之成爲宣傳品，在目前已成爲顯明的事實。不過宣傳一定要有事實根據，同時這種宣傳一定要爲人們所接受。譬如說：「白宮風雲」是宣傳品，「羅宮春色」也是宣傳品，二者同様給人們厭惡的感覺，然而其宣傳的本領却是非常高强的。</p>
<p>那末『瓊島風雲』怎様呢？眞是可笑，不管在任何方面說，都是非常拙劣的。簡直可以說，完全不成其爲電影啊！</p>
<p>此外，我不想再說什麽了。</p>
<h3>好萊塢的歲尾年頭</h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>好萊塢到了歲尾年頭，比較無論那裏都覺得熱鬧。好萊塢的人物，都是異常高興的消磨幾天快樂的光陰，在這幾天之中，都佈滿了喜氣，什麽憂患和任何一切的不快樂都已丢悼了。</p>
<p>卓别麟平常是不出外的。在好萊塢的街上平常很少看見他的。但是一到了歲尾年頭在好萊塢常常可以看見他出没於幾家小跳舞塲中和小咖啡館中。但是大宴會和大跳舞會中，是不大容易見他的。</p>
<p>約翰巴里穆亞和李昻巴里穆亞弟兄二人，並不是喜歡滑稽的人物，但是到了歲尾年頭亦很會取樂。他們二人在去年曾設立了一個巨大的慈善跳舞會。這一天所收入的票價，都捐作貧民救濟會中的基金。</p>
<p>梅樊斯德是最近好萊塢很紅的一個人物，她在今年的新年預備了許多的衣服送給一般貧苦人家的孩子就並且他親自在毎一件衣服上簽着自已的姓名。她立志毎一年都要如此盡力的去帮助這些貧苦人家的小孩子呢。</p>
<p>曼麗畢克馥也是一個喜歡送食品給貧苦的小孩子們的，她毎到了年終的幾天親自做了許多糕和食品到了元旦日的淸早她在門口分送給街上的貧苦人家孩子，這是她的老規則，元旦的早上她的家門口，一定有一番熱鬧的。</p>
<h3>接吻的滋味</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>美國電影界中的有名的小生，尼爾哈密爾頓在他的銀幕生涯中，曾和七十六位不同的女性接吻過，因此這亦就是說，他曾經騐過七十六種的接吻。據他說：「拍愛情片的時候，假使不考慮對方的女明星的個性而表演是一定要失敗的。接吻亦是同様的，隨對方的女人，其接的方法亦各相異。」</p>
<p>現在讓我把哈密爾頓所分類的，五大女明星的接吻方式介紹在下：「海倫海絲的是最理想的；瓊克勞馥的是暴風雨似的；瑙瑪希拉的是現實的；愛里沙郎弟的是理智的；瑪麗普拉安的是最純眞的。」</p>

<p>她瞪着他道：「不！」汽車夫回過頭問到什麽地方去。先莉告訴他到拉斐德公寓。維克多笑道：「那我們還是鄰居呢！我們還有機會見面：：：常常見面哩。」她亦不睬他。車子到公寓門口了。維克多連忙替她提着箱子跳下汽車。先莉和他搶着。箱子蓋好了，裏面絲綢的褻衣摔了一地。她連忙蹲下去拾，眼睛瑩然，差不多要哭出來了。維克多跪在旁邊，帮她拾着：：：那些薄綢，花邊，絲帶做成的東西，和先莉自已一様美麗動人：：：還有一陣陣飄忽的丁香花氣味，那就是先莉自已身上使人陶醉的氣息。</p>
<p>她怱怱地走進了公寓。公寓的門在她的身後砰的一聲關了起來，可來他手裏握着一圑細綢的胸衣。他好像得到了先莉自已似的：：：他已不能再生氣不理他了：：：她好似緊貼在他的心頭。他回到自已屋子裏，想要把自已心裏的一切糾紛衝激，譜成曲子，先莉的曲子，充滿了玫瑰花和黃金，他覺着音調在自已的胸口湧了起來，可是隔壁公寓裏，忽然發出了一種鏘鏘的爵士音樂，把他肚子裏的歌意，又壓下却了。他怒不可遏地跑到窗户口喊道：「鍋爐少敲吧！别敲啦！别鬧啦！聽見没有？」那面的窗開了，維克多的心亦沉下去了。那面窗口的人，不是别人，就是先莉。她說：「我聽見了。」維克多假意問道：「你在那里彈鋼琴嗎？好聽極了。那種和諧！那様的精神！」先莉道：「那不過是敲鍋爐吧了：：：不是你剛才說的嗎？」維克多連忙呌屈道：「我？我没有說什麽呀！我剛才正坐着做夢呢，等到夢醒了，我拾着一</p>
<p>件東西。」他說完了舉起他手裏的胸衣揚着，但是那面砰的一聲，窗户關了。</p>
<p>這弄得維克多太難過了，他知道不應當這様輕佻的。他喊着：「先莉！先筣！我知道錯了。」但是那面窗户還是關着，琴聲又起來了，這使他益加害怕了。什麽都完了！難道讓她一輩子當他是個輕佻男子而不理他嗎？要是他能够再見他一面，解釋一下，那他就死而無怨了。他於是從窗户裏跨了出去，在傾斜的屋頂上爬着。他跳了過去，拉住了一條窗　，懸空吊着。他忽然覺得她的手拉着他，帮他爬了起來。等他爬進了窗户，她問道：「你不摔怕死嗎？」維克多笑道：「你剛才所彈的調兒，好像在呼喚我似的。請你再彈一下，好不好？」於是她就坐了下來，重新彈着那醉人的音調，又提起淸脆的嗓子，唱着“Thenightwasmadoforlove"</p>
<p>維克多帶了一肚子的歌，興怱怱地從先莉的公寓裏，跑了出來。他一直奔向音樂院，因爲他的敎授貝蒂爾和道逹先生已經候了他好久了。等到他到了音樂院進門的時候，一個人正從那裏出來，恰巧和他撞個滿懷。維克多因爲那人把他的好夢撞醒了，不覺怒氣勃勃的駡了一聲「混蛋！」後面貝蒂爾敎授發狂似的喊道：「維克多，那就是道逹先生呀。不過你一定不認識他：：：」維克多的夢好像橡皮球一様，　然破裂了，因爲那個從巴黎遠道而來的戲院大�</p>
<p>經理，有意地轉了身走出去了。但是維克多突然間呌了起來：「我的前程送掉了。但是算得了什麽！我快樂極了！我今天看見了一位世界上最美麗的女子。前程算得了什麽：：：她對我笑了一笑！」（未完）</p>

(10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Du Qiyun Arrived in Xiamen Yesterday to Work</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Du Qiyun arrived in Xiamen from Hong Kong on the 10th and set up an office to work. At 3 PM, he met with reporters, reporting the process of being ordered to enter Fujian to suppress the rebellion. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) The Siming County Party Affairs Rectification Committee was established on the 10th. The three members of the committee, Chen Li and two others, took office. Branch party headquarters and sub-branch headquarters in each district were established simultaneously. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations for the Submission of Tan's Troops</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Jinghao, Acting Education Director of the Central Military Academy, received a telegram from the front lines stating that the defense of the two cities, Yanping and Gutian, was originally by Tan Qixiu's troops. After one attack by the Central Army, they immediately sent personnel to negotiate, expressing their willingness to surrender. Our army immediately entered Yan City. Now that the city has been secured, the rebel forces are weakening, and a direct advance to Fuzhou is imminent. As for the enemy at Gutian Shuikou, they have also been surrounded and blockaded by our army's certain division and will soon be captured. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Naval Vanguard Has Reached Lianjiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan told the Central News Agency reporter on the morning of the 10th that after the navy captured Luoyuan, the vanguard had reached Lianjiang and was fiercely fighting with the 6,000 troops of the rebel Qiu Zhaochen. The Xiamen navy is also advancing along the Zhangxia Road, attacking the rebel Huang Qiang's forces, which number no more than a few thousand. Our side at Lianshan is currently under the command of [illegible], and the Xiamen side is under the command of [illegible]. Lianjiang is only sixty li from Fuzhou, located northeast of Fuzhou. After the army captured Shuikou, Gutian is also under siege. Shuikou is about eighty li from Fuzhou, located west of Fuzhou. Fuzhou is now surrounded by the central army, navy, and air force and is expected to fall soon. The navy is now coordinating its actions with the army and air force. The rebels are currently in a state of panic. Tan Qixiu's troops have already defected, and Mao Weishou's troops have also requested to surrender. The rebel forces have disintegrated and will inevitably scatter. It is unlikely that the rebels will hold on to Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. Although Quanzhou and Zhangzhou have defenses, the rebel forces are isolated, and the people hate them intensely. After Fuzhou falls, the rebels can be completely eliminated. Furthermore, all naval agencies in Fujian have long been recovered, and two small gunboats have also returned to the fleet. The buildings damaged by the rebels are being repaired, and the losses are not significant. After Du Xigui's death, the affairs of the Naval Academy are temporarily managed by the director of military training. The selection of a successor as principal has not yet been determined and will likely be chosen from among the naval veterans. An announcement will be made soon.

<h3>Japan's Purpose in Encouraging Puyi to Become Emperor Is to Prepare for Russia</h3>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu and Others Are Engaged in Fierce Disputes with the Japanese</p>
<p>(Beiping) Talk of Puyi's restoration has been rampant lately. It is heard that the rebel Zheng Xiaoxu and others still advocate restoring the Great Qing Empire, while the Japanese advocate a Manchurian-Mongolian Empire. Therefore, there is a fierce dispute over the title of emperor. At the same time, opinions within the Japanese side are also inconsistent. It is still difficult to predict whether Puyi will be able to usurp the throne and declare himself emperor on March 1st. According to foreign sources, Japan is determined to encourage Puyi's restoration. Its sole purpose is to prepare for Russia. The Japanese plan is that after the establishment of the Manchurian-Mongolian Empire, the puppet organization will be moved into the pass, or at least to Rehe, in order to calmly deploy military operations against Russia in the Northeast and avoid any worries about the rear. (10th Central News Agency) (Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Manchukuo" government is no longer officially relying on the Japanese government to find Puyi's tutor. The most likely candidate is rumored to be Count Hayashi Kenzo. This has been reported in previous telegrams. At the same time, it is also requesting to find three senior officials familiar with court affairs. Among the three, former Vice Minister of the Imperial Household Department, Sekiya Teisaburo, is a strong candidate. (10th News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Liu's Bandits Scattered into Five Groups</h3>
<p>Totaling Over Two Thousand Men with Complete Armament</p>
<p>The Henan Giant Bandit Cui Bangjie Commands from Within</p>
<p>(Shi Yousan's Troops Implement Reorganization and Dismissal)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin from Beiping at 3:00 AM on the 10th. In the afternoon, he told reporters at the Provincial Government that when Liu Guitang's troops first entered Hebei Province, they had 3,000 cavalry. After repeated attacks by garrison troops and local militias in various counties, they still had over 2,000 men with complete armament. Cui Bangjie, a giant bandit from Henan Province, is commanding from within. They have now scattered into five groups, scurrying towards Jiahe, Gaoyang, Suning, Hejian, Boye, and Raoyang. They appear to be defeated on the surface, but are actually closely connected and difficult to defeat. In addition to ordering Zhang Chengde's cavalry division to pursue them, he also ordered Bai Fengxiang's cavalry brigade to intercept them in the Nangong and Hengshui areas. He also telegraphed the chairmen of Shandong and Henan to prevent and block them at the border. It will not be difficult to wipe them out. Shi Yousan's troops, led by Hu Xie Wu, were sent to Yutian. The Provincial Government agreed to reorganize them into security forces, but they refused to be reorganized for a long time and extorted supplies from the local area. The gentry of the county could not bear this and jointly formed a militia of 7,000 to 8,000 people from Fengrun, Jixian, and other counties, setting up a militia headquarters in Zhushuwu Town and branches in Caiting Bridge and Hongqiao, surrounding the county seat and cutting off traffic. Hu's troops refused to surrender. The Provincial Government, together with the Military Department, sent Zhao Ruyi and Li Yupeng to investigate. Hu finally agreed to accept the reorganization of 1,000 men. The remaining 500 men were given 3,000 yuan by the Provincial Government and sent back to their hometown.

He has increased the deployment of a regiment from the 22nd Division to the area north of Shandong for joint defense. A cavalry regiment stationed in Zichuan will board a train tonight and pass through Jinan tomorrow morning to go north of Shandong. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Steel Armor Commander Dai Hongbin led the Taishan armored train to northern Shandong to patrol along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to defend against Liu Guitang.

<h3>Government Handling of Wheat Purchase</h3>
<p>The other day, the newspaper reported that an official of the National Economic Council stated that the council had received a petition from Shanghai flour merchants alleging that the government's purchase and transportation of flour was harming the domestic flour industry. The responsible officials reviewed the matter and concluded that there was considerable justification for the complaint, and advocated against purchasing flour.  Upon investigation, the government's $50 million gold yuan loan is different in nature from previous general loans. The current loan is not in cash, but the government first purchases American cotton and wheat in the United States, with the Financial Reconstruction Corporation of the United States paying the price. The limit for American cotton is 40 million yuan, and for American wheat, 10 million yuan. Our government must wait until the purchased cotton and wheat are transported to our country and sold before obtaining cash. This is what makes it different from general loans.</p>
<p>Some argue that with the government's current position, selling large quantities of foreign cotton and wheat domestically would harm the domestic rural economy. However, Premier Wang has repeatedly cited customs statistics, arguing that domestic cotton and wheat are insufficient, and imports are necessary and would not harm rural areas. Furthermore, the entire $50 million gold yuan loan will be managed by the National Economic Council, which will make overall plans for national construction and rural revitalization. Therefore, it may actually benefit rural areas. Given our nation's poverty, with military and administrative expenses already a struggle, how could we have surplus funds for construction? Moreover, how could we have the credit to borrow foreign debt without harming our sovereignty? Now that the government has managed to borrow 50 million yuan for construction, shouldn't we welcome it? However, on the other hand, regarding American flour, as determined by the experts of the Economic Council, they believe it is unnecessary to purchase. This makes perfect sense, and anyone with common sense would agree. However, is the government free to decide not to purchase under the terms of the contract? Upon investigation, the government's import tariff rates for rice, wheat, and flour, announced on December 16th, showed that the flour tax was twice that of the wheat tax, demonstrating the government's sincerity in protecting the domestic flour industry. Furthermore, it is said that the government suggested to the representatives of the flour mills who petitioned for tax exemption that a condition for tax exemption would be for the flour mills to undertake the sales of the American flour purchased by the government. If this is true, regardless of whether the mills agree, it is not a fundamental solution. If the mills were to undertake the sales of American flour, the flour mills would become sales merchants, inevitably impacting their internal operations. Furthermore, with foreign flour flooding the market, in just six months, the new wheat will arrive. Who will advise on this? This is a concern for the flour mills that would distribute American flour, and it is also something that the government, in its efforts to revitalize rural areas, must consider.</p>
<p>In this difficult situation for both sides, when thinking about construction, we dare to suggest to the government that this American flour, which must be purchased, should not be sold on the market to obtain cash. Instead, it could emulate the "work-for-wheat" approach after the floods of 1932, using the flour to develop the Northwest and provide relief for drought and flood victims in Henan and other places. After the loss of the Northeast, the people and the government have unanimously advocated for the development of the Northwest. Now that the Northwest Office of the Economic Council has been established, when development plans are implemented, all laborers involved in road construction and river dredging could be paid with flour instead of cash wages. The Northwest has suffered from drought for years, with a shortage of grain, and the people have long lost their purchasing power. The government can use American wheat to help them, without conflicting with the business of domestic flour mills. Other disaster areas could also implement the "work-for-wheat" method. Even in the Jiangnan region, where people are accustomed to eating rice, the government could deduct a portion of the wages of workers building roads and embankments and provide them with flour. This would be thinking about construction, forcing a portion of the population to change their diet, and also reducing the consumption of foreign rice, without the contradiction of competing with the domestic flour industry. Now that the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, borrowing one item or one coin should be used as ten items or ten coins. From purchasing American wheat to implementing construction, management should be extremely economical. Currently, the price of American flour is generally higher than that of domestically produced flour. Selling it on the domestic market would inevitably require it to be cheaper than domestically produced flour. Now that grain prices in the Northwest and other disaster areas are higher than in other regions, wages should also be higher. If the government converts the purchased flour into cash and then disburses wages, it would suffer a double loss. Is this economical? If the purchased flour is directly transported to the work sites as supplies, it would not only avoid the aforementioned losses but also avoid harming the domestic flour industry. It would also save on the commissions of brokers during sales. Saving a penny allows for more construction, which cannot be considered unwise. What is particularly important is that the transportation of flour can indirectly increase people's livelihoods. From the start of transport to the destination, state-owned railways, shipping, lighterage, boatmen, brokers, and others would all benefit. After the 1932 floods, all industries were in decline, and cargo transport was at a standstill. If it were not for the Water Disaster Committee's "work-for-wheat" program, transporting and storing wheat flour, and using wheat flour as wages, it is unknown how many tens of thousands of civilian boats along the river would have been split into firewood, and how many tens of thousands of workers would have become bandits. This also has a significant impact on people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Regarding the management of American wheat, we also feel compelled to speak. Recently, there have been rumors that the distribution of American wheat will be entrusted to five foreign import firms to sell to domestic flour mills. If the Chinese authorities are transacting with the Chinese people, why must they rely on foreign merchants as intermediaries? We suspect the accuracy of this claim. However, those who say this argue that if foreign merchants are not involved in the sales, then manufacturers, knowing it is government wheat, will suppress the price, making it unavoidable. The manufacturers have their own explanation. We believe that in national construction matters, the people should cooperate with the government. Manufacturers should have an organization whose members strictly adhere to agreements. Except for the necessary blending purposes, they should not purchase foreign wheat from foreign firms in addition to government wheat. They should also submit a comprehensive budget based on the size of the mill and the urgency of their needs for the government's reference when making purchases in the United States in stages. The government should disclose the purchase price and sell it to the mills at cost. Except for transportation fees, insurance fees, interest expenses, and other items, it should not seek additional profits, acting as a purchasing agent for the mills. However, since purchases are made at different times, prices will vary. If the mills are concerned about disputes arising from different purchase prices for the wheat they receive, they can use the average cost over a certain period as the selling price. As for the protection of payments, it should be handled according to common commercial practices. There are many ways to do this, so why must it involve foreign merchants? We hope the government and the flour mills will work together on this.</p>
<h3>Pacific American-Russian Defense Alliance</h3>
<p>U.S. State Department Denies Establishment of Understanding</p>

<h3>United States Expands Navy</h3>
<p>House of Representatives Begins Discussion</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the House of Representatives cited the strength of the Japanese Navy as a reason to increase the U.S. Navy. Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, introduced a bill authorizing the President to build new ships and replace old ships, so that the strength of the U.S. fleet would be suitable to the extent permitted by treaties. When proposing this bill, Vinson mentioned Japanese naval power, saying that Japan already possesses the naval strength permitted by treaties, and Britain will also act accordingly. However, U.S. warships are uniquely behind, in a frighteningly dangerous position. Even if all the currently under construction new ships are completed, it will still feel that the strength is insufficient. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Representative Vincent proposed today to add more warships. Vincent said that if the United States does not quickly add warships, it will lose its naval position in the world. He suggested building aircraft carriers of 15,000 tons, destroyers of 99,000 tons, and submarines of 35,500 tons. There have been two proposals regarding the Navy in Congress in the past two days. Yesterday, Representative Britten's proposal suggested building 101 warships over four years starting this year, costing approximately $482 million. (National Telegraph dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Actively Plots for Austria</h3>
<p>National Socialist Party Challenges Austrian Government</p>
<p>Terrorist Incidents Expected in the Saar Region</p>
<p>(London) A dispatch from Berlin today revealed German Chancellor Hitler's plans for Austria. It is said that after Austria raises the flag of the National Socialist Party, Habicht will be the first National Socialist Prime Minister of Austria. This plan cannot be realized until Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss leaves office. However, the German and Austrian National Socialist parties expect Dollfuss to resign soon. At the same time, a report revealed in Geneva stated that the Saar Administrative Commission recently seized documents proving that the National Socialist Party had established an organization that uses terror and boycott tactics to undermine the Saar government, and plans to send members from within the Saar region to enter Austrian territory, because it is not difficult to obtain passports in the Saar. In order to prevent German expansion, Russia urgently wants to protect the security of its western frontier, fearing that it will be constrained once war with Japan breaks out. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) National Socialists throughout Austria have now challenged the government. A Salzburg police station was bombed today, causing considerable damage. In the Dallas area, a gendarme was also injured by a bomb. Smoke bombs were also thrown in various places in Vienna. The government is now redoubling its efforts to clear the chaotic atmosphere.

<h3>League of Nations Scheduled to Meet to Discuss Saar Issue</h3>
<p>Simon to Participate in the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>(London) The next meeting of the League of Nations Council will be held on January 15th. The most important item on the agenda is the preparation plan for the 1935 Saar region plebiscite to determine whether the region should be returned to Germany, incorporated into France, or remain under the League of Nations' management. The important coal mines in the region owned by Germany have been acquired by France as compensation for the destruction of coal mines in northern France by the German army during the Great War. The ownership of the coal mines will not be affected by the result of the plebiscite, as it must belong to France according to the Treaty of Versailles. The Council meeting will also consider the report of the newly established Advisory Committee on Slavery, and the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay, and seek a place to live for Assyrian Christians. British Foreign Secretary Simon will participate in the opening ceremony and plans to return to England afterwards, with Under-Secretary Eden representing the British Foreign Office.

<h3>Thorns in Disarmament Still Awaiting Diligent Removal</h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>Mussolini Receives French Ambassador</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, European countries will postpone the opening of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee, originally scheduled for January 22nd, until early February. People close to the British Foreign Office declared that the reason for this postponement is to allow countries to have sufficient preparation and understanding. However, the main reasons are the following: (1) German Chancellor Hitler can have sufficient time to make a detailed reply to France's memorandum; (2) U.S. Plenipotentiary Davis will not be able to arrive in Europe until the end of January; (3) The British government still needs to study Italy's new proposal in detail, based on recent important talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Foreign Secretary Simon; (4) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson still needs to contact various countries and adopt their opinions, which takes time. As for the Italian Prime Minister's determination to support Germany's demands, it will become the biggest issue for the Disarmament Preparatory Committee. According to the new proposal sent by the Italian Prime Minister to the British Foreign Office, he has repeatedly expressed his support for Hitler's demands. (National Telegraph dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent, in the view of all sectors in Britain, holding the Disarmament Steering Committee meeting on January 21st as scheduled will be ineffective.

<h3>League of Nations Fourteenth Anniversary Commemoration</h3>
<p>French Government Fully Supports</p>
<p>Germany Will Not Join Without Reorganization</p>
<p>(Paris) Today is the fourteenth anniversary of the founding of the League of Nations. The French government still strongly supports the League of Nations. Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour will inherit Briand's legacy and strive to thoroughly reorganize it. Since its establishment, the League of Nations has achieved considerable success and has greatly benefited mankind, such as in the relief of infants and women, and the improvement of international transportation, postal services, public health, and economic construction. (National Telegraph dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to general observation, Germany has gradually broken away from the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles, and its recent political policies have focused on two major issues: demanding equality in armaments and recovering the Saar region. It is now planning to begin discussing these issues with France, but whether it will succeed is difficult to predict. However, the two countries' views on disarmament issues are too divergent. As for the Saar region, France is determined not to easily return it to Germany. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations on October 14th last year, expressing its opposition to disarmament and its desire to undermine the Treaty of Versailles. In the fourteen years since the League of Nations was founded, Germany has been a member for only seven years. During these seven years, it was constantly dissatisfied with the League of Nations, saying that the League of Nations was a tool of French politics. Therefore, general politicians say that unless the League of Nations is thoroughly reorganized and not used by France, Germany will never be willing to join again.

<p>Failure Is Inevitable Because It Is Not Suitable for the Times</p>
<p>Advocates Close Cooperation Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday was the fourteenth anniversary of the founding of the League of Nations. The famous British writer H.G. Wells gave a radio broadcast speech in the evening, severely criticizing the League of Nations, saying that Geneva has completely failed, but it should be like this, because the League of Nations is a political machine without a backbone, and has nothing to do with our world and the current major economic problems. Wells also emphatically said that internationalism is now gradually declining around the world, and advocated for closer economic cooperation between Britain and the United States.

<h3>Paris Public Demonstrates Against Chautemps Government</h3>
<p>Explosives Placed on Tram Tracks</p>
<p>Two Hundred and Fifty People Arrested</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, thousands of people in Paris demonstrated in protest of the Bayonne municipal bond case, opposing the Chautemps government. As a result, up to 250 people were arrested. The instigation of this demonstration was due to a certain Communist Party newspaper carrying a report that the death of Stavisky, the financier involved in the Bayonne municipal bond case, was secretly executed by the police, because Stavisky held evidence unfavorable to senior police officials. Except for the demonstrators, no one believes this claim. The demonstrators gathered in various places in Paris, often clashing with the cavalry. At the same time, they placed explosives on the tram tracks, further disrupting order. Fortunately, when the demonstrators attempted to break into the Chamber of Deputies, the police and cavalry rushed to prevent it. Currently, the government is trying to deal with the opposition's attacks after dismissing Colonial Minister Dalimier, and immediately introduced a bill in the Chamber of Deputies prohibiting untrustworthy people from engaging in the trading of stocks and bonds. Those who violate this prohibition will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years. This plan will be presented to Parliament on Thursday morning, and the opposition will begin attacking the government at the same time. If the government cannot overcome this difficulty, it may face collapse. Upon investigation, this cabinet was formed on December 27th last year. If it collapses, its term will be no more than one and a half months. It is heard that the police in Chamonix obtained Stavisky's whereabouts, led by Stavisky's ex-wife. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the outbreak of the Stavisky scandal in France, the Chautemps cabinet has been in danger of collapsing. The reorganization of the cabinet is gradually taking shape, and everything is in line with expectations. However, Paul-Boncour will still be reappointed as Foreign Minister, as it was rumored in advance that Herriot would be appointed to the post of Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, since Stavisky's death, the media has continued to argue that Stavisky's suicide was actually facilitated by the government. In order to ease public sentiment, the authorities ordered a detailed examination of Stavisky's body. The deceased's wife also went to the location of Stavisky's suicide at the same time, under the strict protection of special detectives, with the aim of searching for any hidden banknotes, stocks, and bonds in the area. Currently, the committee organized by the people aims to thoroughly investigate the state of the Paris judiciary to determine how Stavisky evaded legal judgment and whether the Paris authorities were conniving. Today, it was discovered that Stavisky had been charged 19 times since 1929, and the 13th Paris Municipal Council actually postponed each case 19 times. During this period, four court presidents and five prosecutors were suspected of committing offenses. He was charged again last June, but on the day of the trial, not only did the defendant not report, but all witnesses and plaintiffs did not appear in court. Stavisky's lawyer, according to the law, told the court his usual story, that his client's mind was slightly unwell, and asked the court to grant him extreme leniency. The reorganized cabinet will face severe questioning in the Chamber of Deputies starting on Thursday, but it is expected that the cabinet will still be safe and sound. According to Léon Blum's daily newspaper, the Socialists will unanimously support the government to pass a vote of confidence. (National Telegraph dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Radical Socialist members of Congress held a special meeting today to discuss the Bayonne scam. Someone asked Herriot if the party had received Stavisky's assistance. Herriot firmly replied with one word, "No." The conference then passed a resolution supporting Premier Chautemps's strict plan to investigate the case. (National Telegraph dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Chamonix) Stavisky, the main figure in the Bayonne scam, repented and committed suicide. He was buried this morning. His wife attended the funeral. When the coffin was placed in the grave, she fainted from extreme grief. It is said that Stavisky's last letter to his wife was opened and read by the police in front of his wife last night. It contained the line, "The only love I can give you is to prove it with eternal farewell." (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's New Policy</h3>
<p>Non-Productive Land Under State Management</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government plans to establish a land management company in the near future. This is the U.S. President's land policy, which will place all non-productive land under public management. If this company is established, it will need to allocate 25 million to 50 million U.S. dollars from the Relief Loan as startup funds. According to a survey by the Land Economics Section of the Rural Economics Office, one-sixth of the land in the Rocky Mountains and along the Atlantic coast is unproductive. Farmers are eager to sell as soon as possible so that they can find other ways to make a living. The government will use this land for afforestation and other projects.

These talks will be preceded by general trade negotiations between France, the United States, and Britain. Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands are currently conducting these negotiations with France. The document also emphatically stated that France treats all countries equally and has no intention of discriminating against Great Britain. However, France's treatment of the United States cannot be uniquely preferential, and it cannot abolish all or part of the quotas without receiving something in return. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government has reached an agreement with the United States regarding the issue of limiting the quantity of imported goods. The Foreign Ministry yesterday notified the U.S. Ambassador that the French government recently reduced the quantity of imported foreign goods by 75 percent, and now completely restores the original situation. However, the total quantity of U.S. imports will be divided into two parts. One part, 25 percent, is the quantity that the United States is sure to obtain. The remaining part, 75 percent, will be reserved for negotiations with the U.S. government to exchange for benefits. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) The "Standard Evening News" published an article stating that the competition from Japanese commerce in Western markets is extremely fierce. The working classes in Britain and other countries are consequently affected, with their livelihoods increasingly threatened. Urgent measures should be taken on the economic front to prevent this. The author believes that prohibiting the import of Japanese goods is tantamount to economic warfare and would lead to the repeal or amendment of certain treaties. However, there is no other way to defend against Japanese competition. The author also stated that the threat from Japanese commerce to the West has reached an extreme level, and defensive measures are urgently needed. It is hoped that the government will take the initiative to defend itself. If the British government takes action, all countries with high wages will cooperate with it. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Dutchman Lubbe, Convicted of the German Reichstag Fire, Executed on the Guillotine</h3>
<p>Remained Calm During Execution</p>
<p>Request for Pardon Denied</p>
<p>Leipzig: The Dutchman Lubbe, the main culprit in the German Reichstag fire case that shocked the world, was beheaded at the court at 7:30 this morning. According to official sources, the execution was carried out because President Hindenburg did not want to exercise his power of pardon. Since Lubbe was sentenced to death, he had been under the surveillance of Professor Penghefei, a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Leipzig: The Dutch defendant Lubbe, sentenced to death in the German Reichstag fire case, was executed this morning in the Leipzig court prison. Last night, General Werner, the chief prosecutor, notified the defendant that President Hindenburg had decided not to exercise his supreme right of pardon. Lubbe showed no emotion upon hearing this news and remained in his gloomy state. The warden asked Lubbe if he needed any religious ceremonies or anything else before the execution, but Lubbe did not answer. At six o'clock this morning, the warden entered Lubbe's cell and announced that the time of execution had arrived. The prisoner immediately got up and followed the guards without saying a word. General Werner, the chief prosecutor, State Attorney Barisis, Federal Court President Pangrui, three other judges, a doctor, a Jesuit pastor, and other important figures were present at the execution site. Press representatives were not allowed to attend the execution. Lubbe listened to the reading of the death sentence with a calm face and without any expression. The court president asked if he had anything else to say, but Lubbe only shook his head. After Lubbe went up to the guillotine, the blade fell in a matter of seconds, and the execution was completed.</p>
<p>Note: Lubbe was a Dutchman. Shortly after the German Reichstag caught fire on February 27th last year, he was arrested near the Reichstag. At that time, the Hitler government blamed the Reichstag fire on the Communist Party, and the National Socialist Party relied on this case to seize power. In addition to Lubbe, those arrested included German former Communist Party member of parliament Dierglei, Bulgarian Communist Party members Dimedrov, Popov, and Danav, etc. After months of trial by the Leipzig court, Dierglei and the three Bulgarian defendants could not be proven guilty. Only Lubbe was proven to be the main culprit in the arson and was sentenced to death. However, Lubbe had lost his physical abilities during the trial, so the case became a mystery, and the truth could not be revealed. After Lubbe was sentenced to death, the Dutch government requested a pardon, but it was not granted, and he was executed today. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Execution</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Lubbe, the main culprit in the Reichstag fire case and a member of the Dutch Communist Party, was beheaded at 7:30 this morning because President Hindenburg refused to grant him clemency. It had been nineteen days since Lubbe was sentenced to death. It was not until late last night that the Leipzig warden informed Lubbe that the president did not want to exercise his power of pardon and that the execution would be carried out the next morning. Lubbe responded with the same indifferent attitude he had shown during the trial. He was then asked if he wanted a priest to pray for him, but Lubbe did not answer a word and did not express any special wishes. The executioner and his assistants built a guillotine overnight at the prison site. At six o'clock this morning, the warden led Lubbe to the prison site. Only the prison bell rang slightly, announcing that a guilty person was being executed. The public did not pay attention to the execution and did not expect that the executed person was Lubbe. Those present at the scene included Public Prosecutor Dr. Weiler, Leipzig Court President Bunge, three Supreme Court judges, the Senate Warden, and twelve others, as well as one doctor and one pastor each. Lubbe listened with his head bowed to the death sentence. The whole scene was silent. Lubbe followed the executioner to the guillotine. The executioner wore evening dress and white gloves. After Lubbe was secured, his head fell in less than thirty seconds. The executioner then announced that the execution was over. It is reported that the German authorities notified the Dutch government of the execution date two days ago, but no Dutch official was present this morning. Lubbe was examined by a doctor last night, who said that his mind was clear. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Jade Pagoda Displayed in Chicago</h3>
<p>Request for Seizure Due to Unpaid Commission</p>
<p>May Not Be Effective Even with High Court Approval</p>
<p>(New York) A jade pagoda produced by Zhang Wenji (transliteration) of Shanghai, which has been displayed in the Chinese Pavilion of the Chicago Exhibition and the Rockefeller Institute in New York, is now being sued by a man named A. Jin in the Supreme Court. Because Zhang Wenji, the producer of the pagoda, owes a commission of $10,160, he is requesting seizure. Judge Laurie of the High Court has approved the request, but because the Rockefeller Institute has provided a guarantee of $250,000 to ensure that the pagoda is shipped out of the United States, according to U.S. law, this seizure approval is invalid. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Government Rescue Ineffective</h3>
<p>The Dutch government in The Hague expressed great disappointment today at Germany's execution of Lubbe. It is reported that the government had tried its best to rescue him, hoping to reduce the death sentence to life imprisonment. The German authorities notified the Dutch consul in Leipzig that Lubbe's family would be allowed to claim the body for burial. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Unlikely to Have Further Action</h3>
<p>The Hague: According to authorities, German Foreign Minister Neurath notified the Dutch ambassador in Berlin last night that there was no reason to pardon Lubbe and that he would be executed the next morning. Dutch officials believe that this is a matter of the German government's judicial rights, and the Dutch government is unlikely to take further action. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Dutch People Are Very Outraged</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: When the Dutch people heard the news of Lubbe's execution, they were generally very outraged. They felt that after negotiations with the Dutch government, President Hindenburg would definitely reduce Lubbe's death sentence to life imprisonment. Now that the bad news has arrived, everyone is shocked and at a loss. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Serious Dispute Between Russia and the Pseudo-State</h3>
<p>Pseudo-Police Forcibly Seize Documents of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Will Lead to Protests from Moscow</p>
<p>(Harbin) Police of "Manchukuo" forcibly seized documents from a Russian official who is the director of the Development Section of the Chinese Eastern Railway today. This matter seems likely to provoke serious protests from Moscow. Earlier, an accountant from "Manchukuo" asked the Russian official to hand over documents detailing the entry of Chinese Eastern Railway trains into Russian territory. The official refused, so the railway police of "Manchukuo" went to his office and seized them. According to Russian reports, these documents conclusively prove that the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Lube, is responsible for the transfer of the trains to Russia. The "Manchukuo" authorities are now considering legal action to punish Lube. However, Lube holds a diplomatic passport, so this matter will cause a dispute. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Japanese Financial World</h3>
<p>Mitsui Zaibatsu Secretly Colludes with the Bank of Taiwan</p>
<p>The Minseito Party Plans to Raise Questions in the Diet</p>
<p>Involving the Minister of Railways and Communications Gives Military Cliques an Opportunity to Take Advantage</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the investigation by the Policy Research Council of the Minseito Party, an improper relationship between the Mitsui Zaibatsu and the Bank of Taiwan has been discovered, and it is planned to question the government in the 65th Diet. In Showa 2 (1927), during the Hamaguchi Cabinet, the Bank of Taiwan had a deficit of 200 million yen due to the bankruptcy of Suzuki Shoten. The government allocated funds, and all business was reorganized under the Bank of Taiwan. Among them, the Imperial Artificial Silk Company made huge profits after the September 18th Incident. The Mitsui Zaibatsu then sought to acquire its shares. Representatives of the Mitsui Zaibatsu, such as Ikeda Seihin and Go Seinosuke, secretly negotiated with the president of the Bank of Taiwan, selling the shares to the Mitsui Zaibatsu at a 20% discount compared to the market price. It is reported that the two ministers of the Seiyukai Party, Mitsudo and Hatoyama, were involved in this case. The matter concerns official discipline, and they want to launch a crusade in the Diet. If this matter is raised, the financial cliques will give military cliques an excellent opportunity due to private disputes. Financial figures are very worried about this case.

<h3>Sun Ke Returned to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Constitution Will Be Completed According to the Scheduled Procedure</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke, along with Liang Hancao, Ma Chaojun, and Lu Guang, returned to Nanjing by overnight train from Shanghai at 7 a.m. on the 10th, with a sleeper car attached. Sun told a reporter from the Central News Agency that he took the opportunity to go to Hong Kong and Guangzhou to meet with Hu Zhantang and Chen Jitang, Xiao Focheng, and others. The various committee members in Guangdong hope that a larger number of people will be able to attend the Fourth Plenary Session with proposals for the plenary session. The committee members in Hong Kong and Guangdong are very indignant at the rebels in Fujian. It was previously reported that Hu had a peaceful solution, which was that Hu hoped that Chen, Li, and others would repent and automatically abolish the pseudo-government. Now that the pseudo-government is about to be eliminated, it is no longer a problem. Guangdong's defenses are solid and will never compromise with the rebels. There are claims in the Southwest that they want the constitution to be completed as soon as possible, but I have not heard of them. The constitution will be completed according to the scheduled procedure. The Fourth Plenary Session will be held as scheduled, and there is no need to hold any more talks before the meeting. I do not intend to go to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang, as Chiang will return to Nanjing before the plenary session. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke said that he took the opportunity of traveling by sea to meet with Hu Zhantang, Xiao Focheng, Chen Bonan, and others in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Although he was not entrusted with any mission from the Central Government, he did discuss the main policy directions for resolving the current situation during private meetings. What is gratifying is that the level of understanding of the Southwest Central Committee towards the Central Government has been further enhanced after the trip south by Zhang Puquan and others. They all feel that the national and ethnic crisis must be rescued as soon as possible. Four of Hu's eight proposals are quite important and will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion. This proposal is entirely about matters and not about people. The various points listed are all efforts that the Central Government is currently making or has already indicated. Although Hu has no intention of coming to Nanjing for the time being, there is absolutely no talk of Guangdong forming a third government. The Fourth Plenary Session will definitely not be postponed any further. Although the number of Southwest Central Committee members coming to Nanjing to attend has not been decided, it is believed that everyone will feel the importance of national affairs. Except for those who cannot leave due to factual reasons, they should be able to come to Nanjing to attend. As for rumors that Guangdong and Guangxi will jointly issue a declaration and mediate the Fujian situation, I have not heard of them. Chairman Chiang will definitely attend the Fourth Plenary Session, and I do not need to meet with him in the front. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Prepares to Issue Customs Bonds</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the regular meeting of the Central Political Council on the 10th, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi temporarily proposed that approval be given to issue 100 million yuan in customs bonds for the Republic of China in 1934. The reason was that the government had misappropriated funds from the Central Bank over the years, amounting to nearly 100 million yuan. The Central Bank's funds are relied upon to circulate in the market, and they cannot be borrowed for a long time without repayment. However, the government's financial difficulties make it difficult to raise large sums of money. It is now proposed to issue the above-mentioned bonds to repay the Central Bank in full as collateral, so that they can be cleared in installments. Since they do not circulate in the market, they are not related to the market's finances. On the one hand, the Central Bank's funds are consolidated, and on the other hand, the government retains room for financial turnover. The discussion at the scene lasted for quite a long time, and in the end, the principle was passed and handed over to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. After the meeting was adjourned, Finance Minister Kong invited Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke to talk privately in the hall committee office for an hour and a half, explaining the difficult situation. It is heard that Sun has become more understanding, and it is hoped that the proposal can be submitted for passage at the Legislative Yuan's meeting this week. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Requests Correction of Measures for Rewarding Assistance in Smuggling Suppression</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance submitted a report to the Executive Yuan stating that, according to the Inspector General of Customs, smuggling was becoming increasingly rampant. It requested that local authorities assist customs in preventing the illegal import of foreign goods. Measures were drafted stating that when taxable foreign goods and contraband were smuggled into various coastal areas without customs checkpoints, the local authorities should detain both the ship and cargo and hand them over to the nearest customs office for handling. After the customs office confiscated the ship and cargo, half of the bonus should be sent to the local authorities for distribution, etc. Upon instruction from the Executive Yuan, orders were issued to the governments of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, and Hebei provinces to comply accordingly. The Inspector General of Customs reported that since these measures had been circulated by the Executive Yuan, all provincial agencies would certainly comply uniformly without shirking responsibility. However, regarding the bonus, according to current customs practices, if customs officers seize smuggled goods without any informants, they are awarded 20% of the proceeds from the sale of the goods. If there are special meritorious services, the bonus is 30%. For contraband, the bonus ranges from 20% to 60% of the estimated value, depending on the quantity and whether the suspects are apprehended. Now, if various agencies are awarded half of what customs officers receive, the bonus for seizing ordinary goods would only be 10% or 15%, and for contraband only 10% to 30%, which seems too meager to encourage action. Furthermore, the customs office has always treated public security and postal bureaus that assist in seizing smuggled goods and transferring them to customs as informants, awarding them 40% for ordinary goods and 30% to 50% for contraband, depending on the quantity and whether the suspects are apprehended, as per established procedures. Now, giving other agencies assisting in seizing smuggled goods a similar amount to customs officials is inappropriate. For the sake of promoting smuggling suppression and maintaining tax revenue, it is proposed to follow the precedent of awarding public security and postal bureaus and to uniformly award local government, tax, police, army, and navy agencies that assist in seizing smuggled goods and transferring them to customs according to the informant bonus method.

<h3>World War Panic襲擊瑞士　列·山·　(European Correspondence)</h3>
<p>｜The Swiss Militia System is Worth Noting｜</p>
<p>No matter how moving Hitler's peace speeches are, no matter how loudly the French sing about security guarantees, hoping that Europe will be safe and sound, no matter how much Britain fears the danger of war, no matter how Mussolini changes direction, acting as a peace envoy to mediate the European situation, all these actions cannot conceal an iron-like fact: the outbreak of European war is only a matter of time. These platitudes and peace-promoting actions only prove that everyone's preparations are not yet complete, and they are unwilling to act for the time being, a scene of conserving energy and waiting for the right moment. The good show is yet to come.</p>
<p>During the last European war, Switzerland was fortunately spared. In the eyes of the Swiss people, this was an extremely lucky thing. Currently, everyone's premonition is different. It is clear that in the coming war, Switzerland will not be able to remain neutral. Will it align with Italy or with Germany? Switzerland must choose between Germany and France. Therefore, a group of military professionals, capitalists in military-related industries, and French politicians are secretly fueling the flames, expanding the situation and intensifying the public's perception of war. Especially since the second half of this year, newspapers have repeatedly promoted the German military general staff's plan to take Switzerland's path when waging war against France. For a time, this caused a great uproar. Later, on the border between Germany and Switzerland, the German Nazi stormtroopers clashed with the Swiss border guards. This was tantamount to adding fuel to the fire, a propaganda material of the best kind. A neutral small country, whose citizens are usually called pacifists, is now slowly being drawn to the altar of the god of war.</p>
<p>The one who is causing the European situation to fall into a state of tension again is naturally Hitler. He advocates that all German peoples unite and return to Germany. The German population accounts for 69% of Switzerland's population, while the French population accounts for only 21%. If Hitler's proposal is implemented, it would be tantamount to Switzerland being annexed to Germany. This is not only dangerous for the French, but the Swiss themselves also feel uneasy. On the other hand, as the editorial of a Swiss newspaper said, Switzerland is located between the three fascist powers of Germany, Italy, and Austria. Once the European situation changes, Switzerland will be in an extremely difficult position. Under the pressure of the above reasons, there is naturally no other way to go except to strengthen military preparedness. Therefore, the military budget has been increased, and the military organization law has been re-improved to make it more modern.</p>
<p>Although Switzerland is a small country with only four million people, in terms of military preparedness, we have no reason to underestimate it. They themselves are also very clear that it is better to prepare more strength than to rely solely on justice and fairness to maintain their neutrality, perhaps the effect will be greater. To date, Switzerland's military preparedness has at least the following advantages, which seem to surpass the major powers: ㈠ Implementing universal conscription, a thorough militia system; ㈡ The excellent shooting skills of individual soldiers, probably unmatched by any other country in the world; ㈢ In addition, Switzerland also has special strengths in chemical warfare military supplies. If any country wants to invade Switzerland and take this risk, Switzerland will immediately counterattack head-on. Although victory or defeat is not guaranteed, it will never be a case of non-resistance.</p>
<p>Switzerland does not have a formal standing army. All it has is a militia. But in the world, we will never easily find a second country like Switzerland that has achieved the point of "no one is not a soldier." And not only in terms of technology, with exquisite achievements, but also in terms of military ethics, there is a very in-depth education. The Swiss people in general, that is, the soldiers, believe that protecting their country and maintaining Switzerland's neutrality has almost become a national characteristic of Switzerland. The foundation of the Swiss militia is organized on this point.</p>
<p>The general Swiss people, rather than saying that they are living various professional lives, it is better to say that they are living military lives. Every person has a rifle, a full set of military uniforms, and other war necessities. All these items are allowed to be taken home for safekeeping. Every Sunday, even in the smallest village, there is a target range. Almost all young people come to participate in shooting practice.</p>
<p>This target range belongs to the local community, but it is also under the jurisdiction of the military. This is speaking of the infantry. As for the cavalry, in addition to full armour, there are also horses. Most farmers can also use these horses to work on the farm, but they must pay attention to protection, because every year the cavalry captain comes to take charge of the inspection work. Their weapons, horses, and shooting practice results are usually recorded in a book for reference.</p>
<p>The population of Switzerland totals over 4.1 million. In wartime, approximately 500,000 soldiers can be mobilized. This type of army, organized by age, can be divided into three types. Young men from 20 to 29 years old join the artillery corps. Young men from 20 to 32 years old join the infantry corps. Together, 220,000 people can be drawn from these two groups. The reserve team, from 30 or 33 years old to 40 years old, can reach more than 110,000 people. People aged 41 to 48 form the national army, which is also about 100,000 people. Others, such as the ambulance teams and transport teams serving in the rear, etc., can also recruit 150,000 people. Moreover, Switzerland's borders are narrow and transportation is convenient. In the event of an emergency, all can be mobilized and concentrated within a few hours. Recently, it has been working hard to expand new military equipment, paying special attention to aviation plans, which will soon be fully realized. At that time, the combat effectiveness will naturally be even stronger. Although the number of Swiss troops is not large, its combat capability is naturally inferior to that of major countries in terms of endurance. However, if an enemy wants to invade Swiss territory in a short period of time, it is feared that it will have to make extremely large sacrifices. In addition, for another reason, Switzerland is mostly mountainous, with high ground and easy defense and difficult offense, and the geography also occupies a considerable advantage.</p>
<p>The term of service for Swiss soldiers is 29 years for ordinary soldiers and 32 years for officers. New recruits are required to undergo military education when they reach the age of 20. In the recruit school, the infantry receives 65 days of training, the cavalry receives 90 days, including horsemanship, and the artillery and flight teams receive 75 days. If the new plan is implemented, this time will probably be further extended. Every year, there are usually 25,000 new recruit students. In addition to this formal training, their usual training is almost non-stop throughout the year, especially for the training of pilots and artillery. In addition, with the support of the federal government and the governments of various states, there are various para-military educations, such as the Swiss Sports Federation, which spends 450,000 Swiss francs each year to train 25,000 young people in snow sports. Another example is the Shooting Federation, which trains 10,000 16-year-old young people to practice shooting every year. Each young shooter can receive five Swiss francs and fifty bullets each year. There is also a national Swiss shooting competition held every year under the auspices of the Junior Infantry League. This naturally encourages and cultivates many talents. But the most important thing is that their lives at ordinary times are already connected to life in the barracks. For the Swiss, shooting practice every Sunday does not seem to be a job, but a game or entertainment. They themselves no longer have the feeling that practicing shooting is being a soldier. This is because of a long historical relationship, which has gradually made them feel that their behavior is natural and has become a habit. In addition, an exercise battle is held once a week or every few weeks, which reviews the tactics they learned in the recruit school and makes their knowledge of war more sophisticated.</p>
<p>In the eyes of us Orientals, Switzerland is such a small country, and it is also a permanently neutral country. Naturally, the people should not only say peace, but also be unable to hold a gun. However, in fact it is not so. Not only do they not wag their tails and beg for mercy, hoping to get a temporary peace, but they go a step further and fully prepare to give any ambitious person a blow when they try it. This is armed peace. We don't care how Switzerland is forced by the environment and has to embark on a road. But the facts that are revealed, maintaining peace through armament, this is indeed worthy of our deep reflection.</p>
<p>The world is probably not going to be peaceful from now on. Before, everyone thought that the United States could last forever. What is it like now? Switzerland, the only safe country in the West, is now in a storm. We should be worried about the group of important people in China. Once a crisis strikes, where will they escape to?</p>
<p>There is no pure land in the world at present, which is indeed a problem. 1933·12·14·Europe</p>
<h3>Puyi to Move to Rehe After Declaring Himself Emperor of Puppet State</h3>
<p>Puppet State's National Title Set as Great Harmony Manchuria</p>
<p>Attempt to First Invade Chahar and Suiyuan, then Gradually Advance</p>
<p>Japanese Army Acts Arbitrarily Everywhere, Disregarding China</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence. Japan is actively preparing for a world war and has decided to expand the puppet organization of Manchuria in order to suppress its aggression in North China and defend against the desires of a strong Russia. Since the signing of the armistice agreement, the Japanese side has not given up its aggressive ambitions in North China. The North China Independence Movement, the separatist movement, and various other conspiracies have emerged endlessly. However, because of the actual impossibility of success, all have failed to materialize. Recently, they have changed their policy, on the one hand using Shi Yousan and others to secretly engage in activities, seizing opportunities to disrupt, and on the other hand instigating Puyi to declare himself emperor, expand the organization, and extend its influence to western Mongolia. The movement to restore Puyi has been brewing for a long time. Some advocate changing the name to "Great Qing Empire" and expanding the scope to include the interior of China. Others advocate maintaining the status quo of the puppet state of Manchuria, only changing to an imperial system. Still others advocate "Manchu-Mongol State," including Mongolia. Zheng Xiaoxu went to Tokyo before the new year to discuss this matter, and it was roughly determined that the national policy committee of the puppet state, which was preparing for the restoration, convened an important meeting at the beginning of this year and decided that the national title would be "Great Harmony Manchuria" and the political system would be a constitutional monarchy. On the 15th of this month, it will issue a declaration of change of regime, and Puyi will ascend the throne on March 1. After ascending the throne, the first step will be to move the capital from Changchun to Rehe, the second step will be to invade Chahar and Suiyuan, so that when fighting against Russia, it can both prevent Russia's attack and copy the Russian army's rear by Mongolia. The third step is that after seizing Chahar and Suiyuan, it will see the changes in the situation and slowly advance towards North China. At the same time, the traitors bought in the interior of China will rise up in response, forming another situation, or the "Great Harmony Manchuria" will be expanded again.</p>
<p>Recently, the actions of the Japanese army in the north have often gone beyond the scope, disregarding China. The Japanese army invading eastern Chahar is building airfields, constructing roads for automobiles, and deploying fortifications. All kinds of facilities are extremely busy. The Japanese military in the war zone, also in the name of blocking Liu Guitang, is acting freely, from Gubeikou to Miyun. Yesterday, they moved from Miyun to Sanhe, traveling freely. The authorities can do nothing. Observing the current situation, the hidden dangers in North China are worrying, even worse than in the Northeast before September 18. (January 7)</p>
<h3>Details of the Jinpu Railway Robbery</h3>
<p>Fortunate That Public Funds in the Guard Car Were Not Robbed</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. The Jinpu Railway's third southbound express train was robbed by bandits in the early hours of the 8th, at 0:45, in the Heihuzhuang (i.e., Heifengkou) area south of Dongbeibao in Tai'an County. The losses were quite heavy. When the train left Tai'an Station and was heading towards Dongbeibao Station, a person used one yuan in Real Estate Bank notes and two yuan in cash to purchase ten third-class tickets to Darukou Station. The ticket seller at the station immediately sold them the tickets at the price. Subsequently, ten people, all dressed as farmers, entered the station and boarded the train. When the train passed the first signal flag outside, at kilometre 441.100, Liu Guangyu, squad leader of the fourth team of the train's escort, considered it suspicious that ten people had boarded the train at a station that was both small and at night. He intended to conduct an inspection immediately. As he walked from his office location between the second-class and third-class cars, the bandits became aware of it and fired a shot at Squad Leader Liu to demonstrate. One bullet struck Liu in the shoulder. The bandits continued firing shots and began robbing. At this time, one oiler and two teahouse workers were injured, the oiler being more seriously injured. The train still did not stop and traveled about a *li*. More than ten people were found beside the train, immediately shouting to board the train. The bandits on the train also crawled to the front of the train. After the driver was forced to stop the train, only the sound of people shouting to board the train from all directions could be heard. Both the first and second-class passenger cars were searched, and those on the third-class cars who were neatly dressed were also not spared. When the Tai'an and Dawenkou stations learned of the incident, it was already past 2:00 AM. Military police rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already scattered. Fortunately, the large sum of money in the guard car, which was being transported from Jinan to the general office, was not robbed. Zhou Baiqi, the magistrate of Tai'an County, rushed to the Dawenkou area to search. The third armored car arrived at the scene of the incident this morning (the 8th), but no trace of the bandits could be found. (8th Day)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Arrives in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Visiting Qingdao's Rural Construction</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, arrived in Qingdao from Jinan on the evening of the 6th at 10:00 PM. He arrived at around 9:00 AM on the 7th. Mayor Shen Honglie and others went to the station to greet him. Inside and outside the station, security teams and police were temporarily deployed to guard against any possible incidents. After Han got off the train, he and Shen Honglie took a car to the Guesthouse to rest. Those who came with Han included Ge Guangting, Zhang Liancheng, Yao Yijia, Cheng Xixian, Han Duofeng, Ge Jinzhang, and others, as well as forty soldiers from the pistol brigade. At noon on the same day, Shen Honglie hosted a banquet at the Guesthouse to welcome Han. On the morning of the 8th, Han and Shen went to the Qianhai Cliff to visit the newly constructed pier project, and then visited the Seaside Park, Zhongshan Park, Zhanshan New Village, and other places. At around 11:00 AM, they went to Jinkou Three Road to visit Wang Jinyu. At noon, all members of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau gave a banquet for Han at the Guesthouse, during which the issues of rescuing local tobacco and match industries in Qingdao and Jinan were discussed. Han decided to visit the Licun Rural Construction Office on the morning of the 9th. Han said that he came here to visit Qingdao's rural construction, and the plan to build the Qingwei Highway (Qingdao to Weihai) was also discussed with Shen Honglie to proceed. He will return to Jinan in about four or five days, and may get off the train to inspect the troops stationed in various places along the way. (January 8)</p>

<h3>Newlywed Bride Accidentally Drowns</h3>
<p>This morning (the 10th), a woman's body was found in the river behind Pujitang. It was identified as Xingjuan, the daughter of a monk living in the Xiguan of Puzhao Temple in the city. She had just married Lu Xiaodi on September 13 of the Gregorian calendar. Since the marriage, the couple's relationship had been ordinary. Xingjuan's father learned of this and negotiated with his son-in-law Lu Xiaodi. Lu had no choice but to go to the procuratorate of the county court to request an inquest. It is said that the deceased returned to her mother's house last night for family matters, and then returned to Lu's place. While passing Fangjia Bridge, she accidentally slipped and drowned in the river in the darkness.</p>

<h3>Red Swastika Society Opens a Benevolence Bureau</h3>
<p>Wu Qidao and Cai Quchen, the presidents of the Wuxi Red Swastika Society, and Tang Baoqian, the president of the Pure Benevolence Charity Association, in view of the decline in the rural economy, the depression in the market, the increasing number of unemployed civilians, and the daily difficulties of making a living, provide capital for small business ventures, with a limit of 1,200 names, and with Wuxi urban residents as the scope. They are divided into three levels of two yuan, four yuan, and six yuan, depending on the size of the business, and the amount of loan is determined. Borrowers must not argue on any grounds. The term is 100 days, and they must repay in twenty installments. Loans began to be issued from the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Factory Staff Embezzles Public Funds</h3>
<p>Ding Bao Feng, a native of Lachkou, was previously assigned by the Shenxin Third Factory of Taibao Mound, located west of this county, to be stationed in Wuhu, specializing in the procurement of cotton. At the same time, Qian Yongfu was also assigned to assist him. Unexpectedly, Ding and Qian had wild ideas and engaged in large-scale speculative ventures. They lent 3,000 yuan of public funds to others and engaged in stock market transactions, resulting in a loss of more than 30,000 yuan of public funds. After the factory discovered this, Ding and Qian fled and never returned to Wuxi. The factory then filed a lawsuit for embezzlement with the county court of this county. After receiving the complaint, the prosecutor's office repeatedly summoned Ding and Qian, but they failed to appear in court. Until the other day, Ding Bao Feng returned from Shanghai and hid at home. Chief Zhou learned of this and issued an arrest warrant, secretly dispatching bailiff Han Yao Shu to arrest him. He was apprehended, escorted to the court, and personally interrogated by Chief Zhou in an open court. He was then ordered to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Bandit Alarm Occurs at the Intersection of Wuxi</h3>
<p>Mao Gang Sheng, captain of the Wuyi police team, learned that bandits had shot and wounded Hu Di, the head of a merchant group, at night, causing rumors to spread and panic among the people. It was found that Hu Di belonged to Wuxi, near Taihu Lake, and was adjacent to Xueyan Bridge, Zhou Bridge, Daixi Bridge, and other places in Wujin, so the defense had close relations. He specially dispatched patrol team leader Zhuang Zhenying to lead many police officers to depart on the morning of the 9th to rush to Hudi in Xiyi and Xueyan Bridge in Wuyi to strictly prevent and maintain public order.</p>

<h3>Fan Bing Sheng's Office Order of Supervision</h3>
<p>The new county magistrate, Bao Si Xin, officially took office on the 8th. The former county magistrate, Ruan Kai Ji, returned to his native Jinshan at the end of the year, leaving Section Chief Fan Bing Sheng and Secretary Gu Hou Huang to handle the handover. Now, because the Education Bureau has checked that the county government has misappropriated more than 410,000 yuan from the 16th year to the present, according to the county government's explanation, more than 300,000 of them were misunderstood by the Education Bureau, and the actual difference is more than 40,000 yuan. It is necessary to check the handover of past administrations. The Education Department specially ordered County Magistrate Bao to supervise Section Chief Fan, and he must wait for the provincial supervisor Feng Ce, who is responsible for special inspections, to come to Cheng to handle the matter clearly before he is allowed to regain his freedom.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchant Robbed in Yunting Township</h3>

<h3>Dredging Shayao River Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Shayao River in Zhenjiang County is an important river in the fifth district. It irrigates 890,000 mu of farmland, so it is of great importance. However, due to years of neglect, it has gradually silted up. Previously, County Magistrate Zhang approved a special donation of 20 cents each from the top and bottom to pay for dredging. However, according to estimates, the dredging project requires a total of 60,000 yuan. If we wait for the special donations to be collected, it will be two years later, which is too slow to solve the urgent need. The current county magistrate, Ye Zhen Dong, specially held a meeting with local gentry Mr. Leng Yu Qiu to convene a meeting of six banks to negotiate a loan of 6,000 yuan each. In addition, the Pond Works Committee was requested to allocate 18,000 yuan of the pond works funds that should be apportioned to the Ping Chang two cities and townships first, so that there would be more than 50,000 yuan. A committee is being organized, with 11 members planned. In addition to the Property Management Office and the county magistrate being ex-officio members, one person is sent by each of the four banks, and five people are publicly recommended by the local community. After the organization is established, work can begin on a scheduled basis.</p>

<p>Gu Jin Gao, a villager in Nanyang Village, Tenth District, has been working in Shanghai for a living for many years. During the January 28th Incident, he lost his job and returned home to farm rented land for a living. His family of a wife and a son was still able to make ends meet. Unexpectedly, last autumn, he suffered repeated typhoons and locust plagues, and the crops were completely destroyed, with no income. He repeatedly asked the landlord, Chen Yong Sheng, to reduce or waive the rent, but was not allowed. Recently, Chen Yong Sheng urged him to pay more urgently as the end of the lunar year was approaching. Jin Gao was unable to cope and had the idea of ending his life. On the morning of the 7th, he swallowed glass shards to die. His wife discovered it and tried to rescue him, but with little effect. His life may be in danger.</p>

Later, Ding Jian, a prisoner in the prison, was questioned and confirmed the facts. He filed a request with the High Court for investigation. However, Jiang Meng Xiong, the prison warden, submitted a report to the county government, stating that the person selling drugs was Wang Lian Hong, who had filed the accusation. County Magistrate Feng handed Wang over to the Public Security Bureau and handed Chen over to Jiang, the prison warden, for separate custody, pending thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Lifeng Company Suddenly Goes Bankrupt</h3>
<p>Ningbo Jiangdong Lifeng Machine-made Flour Co., Ltd. is a large-scale emerging industry in Ningbo, founded in January of the 21st year of the Republic of China. At that time, the authorized capital was 150,000 yuan. Later, due to smooth business operations, the capital was increased by 150,000 yuan in May of the same year. Unexpectedly, the company suddenly went bankrupt last month, with a huge loss of more than 900,000 yuan. The company's creditors, Rui Yu Zhuang and 57 other companies, believe that the company's directors and supervisors did not declare bankruptcy in accordance with the company's regulations, resulting in huge losses, which is a violation of duty and a criminal offense. They filed a lawsuit with the Yinxian District Court Prosecutor's Office accusing the company's directors Dai Xun, Gu Zhao, Qian Zong Qing, Shi Wan Chi, Ling Bo Lin, Ye Shou Chen, Sheng Shu Heng, supervisors Yu Zuo Zhan, Sun Cai Ling, and Chen Qing Quan of breach of trust.

<p>Vessels Steaming Near to Assist in Aftermath</p>

<h3>Those Escaping to Shanghai Say Panic in Fujian</h3>
<p>People fleeing : : Market depressed</p>
<p>Since the Central Army recaptured Yanping, people in Fuzhou have been extremely uneasy. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson’s ship “Jie Sheng” came to Shanghai from Fujian with many passengers. Our reporter specifically asked passengers about the recent situation in Fujian. They stated that people are panicked every day, and the market is even more depressed.</p>
<h3>People Extremely Uneasy</h3>
<p>Fujian is very secretive about the war on the front lines, so the people cannot know. Since the Central Army occupied Yanping and the Fujian Army was defeated on the front lines, the defense of Fuzhou became suddenly tense a few days ago. When the Jie Sheng ship left Fujian, there were defensive works on the outskirts of Fuzhou, with barbed wire and sandbags along the city, as well as obstacles. After 6:00 p.m., all the lights in the city were turned off, and there were no more night markets in the shops, so people were greatly panicked. Japanese residents in Fujian have been moving to Nantai to take refuge.</p>
<h3>Residents Fleeing Everywhere</h3>
<p>The wealthy residents of Fujian fled to Hong Kong and Shanghai to take refuge as early as a month ago. After the authorities banned the migration of the masses, and those leaving the country had to be certified by the Public Security Bureau, the residents were even more panicked. Therefore, the middle and lower classes have also been fleeing far away recently, fearing interference from the authorities, so most of them fled to Xiamen, and then from Xiamen to various places. Those who have not left Fujian are all people who are unable to travel far.</p>
<p>[P-City Extremely Depressed&gt;</p>
<p>Business in Fuzhou has been stagnant for the past two months, and trade in all industries has almost completely stopped. Because of import and export goods, the customs has no tax revenue. The authorities telegraphed the shipping companies in various places last month, requesting them to restore the Fuzhou route, and requested Chinese ships to change their flags to foreign flags. As a result, none of the Chinese merchant ships sailed, causing financial panic to reach an extreme level.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Profiting Immensely</h3>
<p>In the past two months, only the British Jardine Matheson’s ship “Jie Sheng” has been sailing on the Shanghai-Fujian line. The Osaka Company of Japan has three ships, but only one ship sails every day. Therefore, the “Jie Sheng” has the best business. Every time it comes to Shanghai, the ship is full of passengers. In the past, the steerage berths were only sold for six or seven yuan per person, but now they have been successively raised to more than fifty yuan. A canvas berth also costs more than forty yuan, and you have to plead with them, fearing that others will buy it. Mr. Deng, the comprador of the ship, has always suffered losses every time, but since the Fujian Incident, the income from passengers has increased more than ten times compared to before, and he can earn more than one or two thousand taels per trip. The comprador has become a millionaire in more than two months. Jardine Matheson has a guaranteed payment system, which has also increased relatively. Recently, when the ship goes to the Min River, it is often inspected by the navy when entering the port.</p>
<h3>Refugees in the “Jie Sheng” Ship</h3>
<p>In the last trip between Shanghai and Fujian on the “Jie Sheng” ship, there was a shortage of both import and export goods. On this trip to Shanghai, water transport and other items from Fujian are full again. As for the export goods shipped from Shanghai to Fuzhou, they have also suddenly increased, about three or four hundred tons, mostly wheat flour and textiles needed for people’s livelihood. This time, there are more than 400 Fujian refugees taking the “Jie Sheng” ship to Shanghai to take refuge.</p>
<h3>Feng Yu Xiang in Mount Tai</h3>
<p>Li Lie Jun Denies Rumors Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>It has recently been rumored that Feng Yu Xiang, who is recuperating in Mount Tai, has traveled to Peiping. Yesterday morning, according to Central Committee Member Li Lie Jun, Feng is still in Mount Tai. The rumors are definitely not true. Moreover, Feng’s recent telegram of condolences to Mrs. Wu Ti Yun in Hong Kong was also sent from Mount Tai, which further proves the point.</p>
<h3>Su Bing Wen’s Speech</h3>
<p>Coming to Shanghai this time to meet old subordinates</p>
<p>Ma Zhan Shan going to the United States is not true</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese general Su Bing Wen has lived in seclusion in Xiaojia Lane, Suzhou, since returning to China from Europe, and has not asked about military and political affairs for half a year. Because many of his former subordinates lived in Shanghai, Su came to Shanghai from Suzhou the day before yesterday to reunite with old friends and to visit Zhang Xue Liang, who had just returned from a tour of Europe. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him at his hotel yesterday morning. According to his talk, as follows:</p>
<h3>Meeting Old Subordinates</h3>
<p>According to Su, since he settled in Suzhou, he has been writing and reading behind closed doors all day long, and has not been able to clearly understand external affairs. There is no task for coming to Shanghai this time. Because many of my former generals who fought against Japan in the Northeast in the past are now scattered in Shanghai, seeking a living, and it has been several months since we last met, so I came to Shanghai to meet them. I have met them one by one yesterday. And because Zhang Xue Liang just returned from a tour of Europe and arrived in Shanghai, I went to pay my respects. Because there were so many people who came to pay respects, I did not talk much. I did not ask about Zhang’s future actions, positions, etc. I will stay in Shanghai for a few more days and then return to Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Recent Situations of Ma and Li</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked about the Jin telegram claiming that General Ma Zhan Shan recently requested the government to allocate 30,000 yuan to go to the United States for inspection. Is this true? According to Su, I have not been in contact with General Ma for a long time, and I do not know his recent situation. However, I learned that the visit to the United States for inspection is probably not true. As for General Li Du, he has not left Shanghai since returning from Mount Lu, and his brain disease has not yet healed. Su did not say that my former subordinate, Zheng Run Cheng’s army, who retreated from the Northeast to Xinjiang via Russia, is now stationed in Dihua, and its station is within the jurisdiction of Sheng’s department, which should be close to the provincial government. Because Xinjiang is located on the frontier and transportation is inconvenient, communication is difficult, and the recent situation cannot be known.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xue Liang Invited Old Subordinates to a Banquet Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Asked in Detail About the Situation in North China</p>
<p>Written Speech Rescheduled to be Released Today</p>
<p>Zhang Plans to Enter Beijing for the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Since Zhang Xue Liang, former chairman of the Peiping Military Affairs Committee Branch, arrived in Shanghai, the date of his departure from Shanghai has not yet been determined. Zhang continued to receive guests at his residence yesterday morning, and hosted a banquet for his old subordinates in Shanghai at noon. He is scheduled to release a written speech this afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>After the Central Army’s Victory in the Campaign Against Fujian, China Merchants Bureau Formally Takes Over Two Sea Vessels</h3>
<p>Hai Xiang and Hai Rui Change to Hang Bureau Flags</p>
<p>Because of the business development of the China Merchants Bureau, the number of ships is insufficient for distribution, so there is a move to build seven new river and sea ships. During the time of the former Guo Wai Feng, two Norwegian sea vessels were purchased and assigned to the North and South Ocean routes. However, because the ship price was not paid, it was impossible to take over for a long time. Until Liu Hong Sheng took office, in order to develop the business and lack tonnage, he paid the ship price first. Now it has been formally taken over, and it will be reported to the Customs immediately to correct the ship name and change the Bureau flag, and it will be assigned to the North and South Ocean routes. This is also the price of valuable documents.</p>
<h3>Two Norwegian Vessels</h3>
<p>Hai Rui was originally named Beutem, with 1,850 tons, and Hai Xiang was originally named Bentik, with 1,852 tons, each with a draught of 261 feet. They were both Norwegian merchant ships. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Guo Wai Feng purchased them from a Norwegian shipping company while in office. It is heard that the ship price was 16,000 pounds, and it was agreed to pay in installments. The ships were first used by the Bureau, and must wait for the ship price to be paid off before they can be received by the Bureau. Therefore, although the two ships have been assigned to various routes for two years, they still fly the Norwegian flag.</p>
<h3>Ship Price Paid Off</h3>
<p>In November of last year, due to the successful intermodal transport of the Longhai Railway, the Bureau initially planned to send the two ships to operate on the Lao Yao route, so Liu Hong Sheng paid the final installment of the ship price for the two ships, preparing to have the Bureau formally take over and assign them to the Haizhou intermodal transport route. Later, due to the draught relationship, Tonghua and other ships were changed to operate on the Lao Yao route, and Hai Rui and Hai Xiang were still sailing on the Qingdao-Guangdong line. After the ship price was paid, it was originally scheduled to be received and renamed in December of last year, but the Fujian Incident occurred again and was postponed until today.</p>
<h3>Formally Receiving Passengers</h3>
<p>After the Fujian Incident occurred, the two ships were relatively safer to operate in Xiamen and other places because they flew the Norwegian flag. Therefore, the receiving date was postponed until today. Recently, because the Central Army won the campaign against Fujian, there is no problem for merchant ships to operate, so the Bureau decided to formally take over the two ships as soon as possible and assign them to the route as soon as possible. The Bureau has issued the ship names "Hai Rui (HaeJui)" and "Hai Xiang (HaeHsiang)," the tonnage, length, hatch, machinery, number of wheels, deck, and construction year (built in the United States in 1918), and submitted them to the Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Communications, the Jianghai Customs, and other places for registration, and applied for ship licenses. The documents were sent out immediately in order to remove the Norwegian flag and change to the Bureau flag.</p>
<h3>Assigned Route</h3>
<p>The two new ships are purely cargo ships and have no passenger seats. The Bureau has already decided that after receiving them, the Qingdao to Nanhua route has the most cargo transportation, so the two ships will still be ordered to operate on that line, and the Wu Yang and Kun Xing ships will replace them to operate on the Lao Yao route in Haizhou, and the Tonghua ship will be replaced to operate on the Tianjin route. The Jiahe ship will temporarily run on the Yangtze River route, so that the ships will not be empty and the goods can be transported.</p>

<h3>Speech to be Released Today</h3>
<p>Zhang originally planned to release a written speech yesterday afternoon, detailing his experience in Europe and his feelings about returning to the country. Later, because he was too busy with social engagements the night before, he only got rest after noon, so he did not have time to draft it himself. Yesterday, he sent Mi Chun Lin to notify the visiting reporters that the written speech will be released tomorrow afternoon (that is, this afternoon) at 10:00 (two o'clock), and according to Mi, Zhang will stay in Shanghai for a few more days, and he will probably not leave Shanghai recently.

<h3>Dependents of Li Du’s Troops Arrive in Shanghai from Russia</h3>
<p>Mrs. Chen Zong Dai, Son, and Others</p>
<p>Li’s Old Subordinates Also Sent Personnel to Visit Li and Ask for Instructions</p>
<p>Min Yan News Agency says that after General Li Du, the former deputy commander of the Northeast Border Defense Army stationed in Jilin, retreated to Russia, tens of thousands of his old troops remained stationed in Jilin Province, led by Chen Zong Dai as the acting commander-in-chief, and continued to resist Japan for another year. Because Chen ran out of ammunition and supplies, his dependents retreated to Russia first, and arrived in Shanghai on the Sergei Kiroff ship from Vladivostok the night before last. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Retreating from Jilin to Russia and Returning to China</h3>
<p>Mrs. Chen and her two sons, one daughter, and eight relatives of Chen, cared for by adjutant Wu Bing Wen, retreated to Russia in August of last year and stayed in a Russian hospital. On January 3 of this year, they set off from Vladivostok on the Sergei Kiroff, a cargo ship of the Business Office of the Dongxing Railway of this port, and sailed for a week. It arrived in Shanghai the night before last and was docked at the No. 15 pontoon in Yangshupu. The municipal government learned of this and ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to protect it. General Li specially sent Wang Zi Yao and Dong Lin Ge to greet and disembark. They are temporarily living at No. 100 Jingan Villa.</p>
<h3>Li Du Went to Express Condolences</h3>
<p>General Li Du, together with his wife, Ms. Xie Yi Qing, went to express condolences to Mrs. Chen and other dependents of the anti-Japanese generals who came to Shanghai that evening. General Li could not help but cry when he saw their suffering from displacement and wandering. A reporter from Min Yan News Agency specially visited Mrs. Chen yesterday. According to her, Chen was ordered to lead the troops in place of Li after Li retreated to Russia, and fought against Japan for another year. Because the rear supply had been cut off, Yu and others were forced to retreat to Russia and return to China in August of last year. Chen also led his troops to retreat to Russia on November 26 of last year, and is now leading more than 20 generals to Shuangchengpu to negotiate with the Russian authorities on the treatment of the troops who retreated to Russia. The thousands of troops who retreated to Russia were led by Chief of Staff Xu Qi Dong to Boli. Mrs. Chen spoke with grief and indignation.</p>
<h3>Ding Chao is Still Alive</h3>
<p>Among those who came with Chen’s dependents this time was also Liang Qi Shan, the representative of Gao Yu Shan. According to Liang, after Commander Chen retreated to Russia, the troops left in Jilin are now led by Gao, concentrated in the Hulin and Raohe areas in eastern Jilin. This time, he came to meet General Li to ask for instructions on everything. As for General Ding Chao, chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, because he was forced to surrender to Japan, he was sent to Changchun. News has been cut off, and it was previously reported that he was killed. Now it is learned that Ding is still living in Changchun and has not held any false positions. He also sent Zhao to Shanghai last month to report the recent situation to General Li.</p>

<p>Japan Plots to Monopolize Fishing in the Eastern Hemisphere</p>
<h3>Our Country's Territorial Fishing Rights Will Be Infringed</h3>
<p>According to a compilation of foreign intelligence published by the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, the Fisheries Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has invested 300,000 yuan over the past two years (i.e., Showa 7 and 8) in a large-scale survey of southern fishing grounds in the South China Sea and the South Seas, discovering countless new fishing grounds and achieving great success. Based on this experience, the bureau plans to expand the overseas fishing ground survey on a wider scale and fundamentally reorganize to adopt a comprehensive policy of seizing overseas fisheries. The budget for the next fiscal year has been increased to 1.46 million yuan, which has been decided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and is currently being negotiated with the Ministry of Finance. It is said that this revised plan for overseas fisheries policy also includes a base plan for the future of Northern Ocean fisheries, and even intends to expand dramatically to the entire ocean in the Eastern Hemisphere, opening an unprecedented situation in the history of Japanese fisheries. This move is not only for the development of fisheries, but also attempts to provide powerful assistance to its navy in Pacific operations, which is worthy of attention. The outline of the plan is briefly described as follows:</p>
<h3>Survey of Fishing Grounds in the Eastern Hemisphere</h3>
<p>In the past, the Japanese government's fisheries research institute did not have fishing ground survey vessels. Now, it plans to invest 900,000 yuan to build a 1,000-ton fishing ground survey vessel to search for new fishing grounds in the entire South China Sea, Southern Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The new fishing grounds obtained with more than 500,000 yuan in the next fiscal year will focus specifically on the Pacific Ocean, so that the dispatched fishing vessels can also serve as reconnaissance of the sea surface, creating a powerful intelligence network to provide powerful assistance for Pacific operations in the event of an emergency. As for the Antarctic, whale populations are known to be abundant, and the harvest will be great. In addition, the fisheries research institute will study the utilization and disposal of fish and other large quantities of fish.</p>
<h3>New Inspection Vessels for Northern Ocean Fisheries</h3>
<p>The navy will allocate 1,000-ton-class special service ships and destroyers to be converted into Northern Ocean fisheries surveillance ships to replace the existing Kinshū Maru. The estimated first-year budget is 350,000 yuan, and the second-year budget includes equipment for shipboard aircraft for surveillance and investigation of fish schools. This is because the current surveillance ships, such as the Shōhō Maru, Hakukō Maru, and Shun'yō Maru, are felt to be insufficient for application, and it is planned to build two new 100-ton and 60-ton vessels, with a budget of 370,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Fishing Grounds Has Already Begun</h3>
<p>Because the current fishing grounds and fishing areas are complex and uneven, and disputes over fishing rights are constant, it is planned to carry out controlled reorganization and unification to guide economic development and seek the revitalization of the fishing village economy. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the prefectures and counties will send special guidance to take charge of this matter, with a budget of 240,000 yuan. In addition, an advance base for Northern Ocean fisheries will be established as part of a five-year plan, with a total cost of 16 million yuan (3.3 million yuan in the first year), and preparations have already begun. The base location is roughly on Paramushiro Island, Funato Bay. This base case is an important part of the ocean fisheries expansion plan, and a decision has been temporarily reserved due to budget concerns. According to the above, if each is realized, there is no doubt that the fishing rights within China's territorial waters will be greatly infringed upon, and it is advisable to pay attention to this as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Postal Service to Xinjiang Partially Suspended</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Post Office, the postal routes to Xinjiang have all been blocked, causing the postal services to and from that area to be temporarily suspended. All types of mail sent to that area that have already been mailed are being held in transit. Airmail to Gaolan and areas west of Jiuquan has already been suspended. Although other types of mail to Xinjiang are currently being accepted as usual, they will only be forwarded to the point where transportation is blocked. As soon as the postal routes are open, they will be forwarded to the recipients' locations.</p>
<h3>National Mining Federation to Issue Bonds of 20 Million</h3>
<p>To Aid Mining Merchants Across the Country</p>
<p>Currently Discussing Guarantee Measures</p>
<p>For the sake of aiding the mining industry across the country, the National Mining Federation, at a meeting of mining merchants convened by the Ministry of Industry on June 1st of last year, the representatives of the mining merchants proposed issuing 20 million yuan in bonds to provide relief. However, due to various problems, it was delayed. It was not until the 21st annual meeting of the association on December 10th of last year that it was resolved to request the Ministries of Finance and Industry to approve the issuance. It has been more than a month since then, but it has not yet materialized. It is now known that the association believes that mining merchants urgently need assistance and has already submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry for approval. At the same time, it has sent letters to mining merchants to exchange views in writing on bond distribution and repayment methods. Once the opinions of the mining merchants are collected and the collateral is determined, it can proceed with further consultations with the authorities to issue it as soon as possible to aid the mining industry.</p>
<h3>General Labor Union Petitions for Protection of Laborers</h3>
<p>Year-End Dismissals Are Approaching</p>
<p>Employers Dismissing Workers</p>
<p>Requesting Prompt Prevention</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and other agencies, stating: "Petition to prevent employers from dismissing workers without reason at the end of the lunar year, to relieve the hardship of workers and ensure social stability. Employers, taking advantage of the end of the lunar year, often indulge in habit and dismiss workers, causing innocent workers to suffer the pain of unemployment in this winter with ice and snow. This is unreasonable in both emotion and reason. Moreover, since the Fujian Incident, the base of the nation has been endangered by Red bandits. The relationship between our labor and capital should not allow for disputes to arise from time to time, causing social order to fall into unrest. The union feels threatened and cannot remain silent. It is hereby requested that your esteemed associations review and verify, and promptly prevent employers from dismissing workers without reason at the end of the year, to ensure social stability and relieve the hardship of workers. This would be a benevolent act."</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Fishery Protection Office, Various Ships Departed Yesterday for Patrols</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Industry abolished the Fishery Administration Bureau and established the Fishery Protection Office, the original site of the former Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Administration Bureau in Runshoufang, Tongqing Street, was inconvenient for dispatching patrol ships, so it was planned to find a suitable location on the Bund for office work. However, there are very few vacant houses along the Huangpu River, so the originally planned relocation within this month has become impossible. The patrol ships of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang, Hebei-Shandong, Fujian-Guangdong, and Hebei-Shandong-Guangdong bureaus, except for the two patrol ships of the Fujian-Guangdong and Hebei-Shandong bureaus, have not yet been taken over by the office. The remaining four ships of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area, such as the Haihong, Haigu, Haiying, and Biaohai, were dispatched yesterday to protect fisheries. It is estimated that: (1) the Haiying patrols the area between Shenjiamen and Shengshan; (2) the Haigu defends between Chongming Island and Shengshan; (3) the Haihong is in charge of the area between Shenjiamen and Wentai; (4) the Biaohai departs at any time to patrol various places. According to Director Yuan Lianghua, the fisheries protection by the ships is sufficient for distribution. The winter fishing season is about to expire, and the spring fishing season will begin around mid-January of the lunar calendar. The office has decided to set up fisheries protection according to the past management bureau's methods.</p>
<h3>The Sanbei Company's New Ship, the Jing'an, Sails to Qingdao This Morning</h3>
<p>Hosted Visitors from All Circles Yesterday</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company purchased the Jing'an ocean liner from the Ministry of Navy for 260,000 yuan. After the company thoroughly repaired and greatly transformed it, added passenger seats, and built new rooms, the entire project was completed a few days ago. In order to open a new route between Shanghai and Qingdao and inaugurate a formal passenger ship, it is permitted to depart from Shanghai to Qingdao for its first voyage today. Because the ship's hull is strong, its machinery is excellent, and its speed is high, it is expected to take 32 hours to reach Qingdao from Shanghai. Yesterday, the ship was docked at the company's pier in Nanshi. Tea and refreshments were specially prepared on board, and Yu Qiaqing and manager Shen Zhongyi, among others, hosted visitors from all circles and fellow countrymen. Many guests came on board to visit and were treated with tea and refreshments. The ship has a displacement of 3,500 tons, a length of 260 feet, a width of 40 feet, a draft of 15 feet 4 inches, and an engine power of 1,000 horsepower, with a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour. The cabins are divided into ten first-class dining rooms, seven second-class dining rooms, sixteen official cabins, and third-class and steerage cabins can accommodate 1,000 passengers. The overall layout and painting of the ship are very beautiful and it is the most excellent ship in the Sanbei Company's fleet.</p>
<h3>Generals of the Righteous Army in Shanghai Jointly Appeal to All Circles</h3>
<p>Patriotic Heroes Fight Bitterly in the Black Mountains and White Waters</p>
<p>In the Icy and Snowy Lands, They All Become Gaunt and Wretched</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that Zhou Tiehua, commander of the 4th Detachment of the 9th Route of the Northeast Righteous Army, arrived in Shanghai in December of last year via Rehe to report on the fighting situation of his unit over the past two years and request assistance from all circles. After a month of futile appeals, the iron-blooded warriors on the front lines, huddling in the icy and snowy lands, have all become wretched and gaunt, and their miserable plight is indescribable. Therefore, representatives of various units and generals in Shanghai jointly sent a letter to Song Qingling, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shiying, Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, Jian Zhaojie, and other celebrities, requesting relief. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, Since 1918, Tiehua and others have either led our country's heroes in bitter battles in the Black Mountains and White Waters, or followed our anti-Japanese generals and shed blood in eastern Rehe and western Liaoning. In the past two years, although we have not been able to defeat the Japanese bandits and return our mountains and rivers, we represent the patriotic spirit of our entire nation, which is recognized by the people of the country. After the signing of the Tanggu Truce, our army's rear support was cut off, but our work continued. Hundreds of thousands of heroes are still struggling in hardship, making a final struggle. Therefore, Tiehua and others risked danger to come south and seek assistance from all circles. Unexpectedly, after arriving in the south, the government did not provide any assistance, and society did not even inquire. Recalling the time when we left the customs, we received generous assistance from heroes at home and abroad. Compared to the past, we have unlimited regrets. Who would have thought that those who resisted Japan in the past are now displaced and in a miserable state beyond description. Tiehua and others have a heart to serve the country, but there is no way to appeal. Therefore, we have been wandering around Shanghai for months, sighing at the roof. Now that the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, starvation and cold are imminent. All units are in urgent need of reorganization. Therefore, we have no choice but to boldly and tearfully appeal to all circles, requesting you to grant assistance so that we can return north early and continue to kill the enemy, to live up to the earnest hope of the people of the country and fulfill our duty as ordinary people. We cannot express our urgent anticipation. On behalf of Zhou Tiehua, Zhang Zhendong, etc."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables for Reduction of Coal Freight Rates on the Zhengtai Railway</h3>
<p>National Railway Coal Freight Rates Are Uniquely High on the Zhengtai Line</p>
<p>Unequal Treatment for Other Mines as Well</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Railways, and the Zhengtai Railway Bureau, stating (titles omitted): On the 8th of this month, we received a joint letter from the Pingding County Coal Merchants Association and the Pingding County Coal Mine Affairs Office of Shanxi Province, stating: Shanxi has always been known as a coal-producing area, and Pingding County, where Yangquan coal is produced, is particularly abundant. The entire area is mountainous, and more than 200,000 people, directly and indirectly, rely on coal mining and transportation for their livelihood. This coal production relies solely on the Zhengtai Railway for export, amounting to approximately 700,000 tons annually. The distance from Yangquan to Shijiazhuang is 121 kilometers, with a freight rate of 3.025 yuan per ton, or 0.025 yuan per ton per kilometer. The annual freight revenue accounts for nearly half of the railway's total income. The quality of Yangquan coal is excellent, comparable to Hongay coal produced in French Indochina. In the past, the largest sales area for Yangquan coal was along the Pinghan Railway, south to Shunde and north to Baoding, accounting for more than half of the annual output. The remainder was sold in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Currently, due to rural bankruptcy in the interior, purchasing power is weak, and due to various factors related to national economy and people's livelihood, mines are unable to reduce production, resulting in mountains of stockpiled coal. Although efforts are being made to reduce costs, sales have not improved. We believe that the annual sales of Hongay coal in Shanghai are nearly 400,000 tons. Yangquan coal can compete with and substitute for this Hongay coal, and can recover more than 6 million yuan in concessions annually. However, the extraordinarily high freight rates on the Zhengtai Railway make it difficult to develop external markets, which is contrary to the purpose of promoting domestic coal. Furthermore, all national railways, with the Pingsui Railway being the most difficult, have reduced freight rates on Shanxi coal due to the abundance of coal in northern Shanxi and high freight rates. The export freight rate for Shanxi coal from Kouquan to Fengtai has been reduced from 4.7 yuan per ton to 3.7 yuan per ton. Since its implementation, the number of exported coal has increased dramatically. Recently, the Pinghan Railway has also implemented a 10% reduction in the special export coal freight rate from Shijiazhuang to Fengtai, totaling a 20% reduction, to support the development of domestic coal. The Zhengtai Railway's coal freight rates have always been exceptionally high compared to other railways. The freight rate for Yangquan coal on the same route is several times higher than the freight rates for the Jingxing Zhengfeng mines, which are very close. This violates the principle of decreasing freight rates with increasing distance, and lacks the spirit of cooperation between railways and mines. If this continues, all Yangquan coal mines will inevitably be shut down, affecting national tax revenue, workers' livelihoods, and local security, which is a cause for concern. The recovery of the annual leakage of over 6 million yuan will be merely an illusion. Our association has repeatedly considered that reducing Zhengtai freight rates is a crucial measure to save the nation and the people. In addition to writing to the Zhengtai Railway Bureau and submitting separate reports to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways and Industry requesting a reduction in freight rates, we hereby earnestly request your association to provide assistance by telegraphing the Executive Yuan and relevant departments to approve the reduction of freight rates to maintain the mining industry and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. We would be deeply grateful. The association checked the survey tables published by the said association. Among all national railways, the freight rates for coal are the lightest in Jinpu and Hunan-Hubei, the heaviest in Pinghan, and Zhengtai is even higher than Pinghan. Most recently, the most unfair thing is that the Zhengtai Railway charges lighter rates for other mines such as Jingxing Zhengfeng, but charges heavier rates solely for Shanxi coal. The ratio of light to heavy is four to one. How could we not be indignant! In the past, the railway had foreign debt relations, and the authority was also inverted, which is not surprising. Now that the railway's debt has been cleared and the management rights have been fully recovered, why should we continue to repeat the same mistakes, harming the only industry lifeline of Shanxi Province? Even if the railway's income is reduced after the reduction of freight rates, the development of mining will increase railway transportation, and the gains and losses will compensate each other. Moreover, the railway's finances are much better than those of the Pingsui Railway. The Pingsui Railway is still able to reduce freight rates for Shanxi coal, but this railway alone maintains existing practices, which is even more difficult to understand. Based on the above circumstances, we should telegraph your office to review and approve, and order the Zhengtai Railway Bureau to reduce the freight rates for Shanxi coal to maintain the mining industry and for public convenience.</p>
<h3>Fujian Compatriots Denounce Traitors</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the rebellion occurred in Fujian Province, the people of the province have suffered deeply. Overseas Fujian compatriots, with their homeland occupied by rebels, have issued the following telegram: The Fuzhou Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, the Xiamen Siming County Chamber of Commerce, forwarded to the chambers of commerce of various counties, various autonomous regions, and various community groups for their consideration: Li and Chen collude with the communists, betraying the party and the country. All those with blood and vigor will denounce them. However, He Gonggan, Sa Zhenbing, Lin Zhifu, Chen Yaokun, and others are servile and help the wicked, not hesitating to use their homeland as a den of evil, selling official positions and provinces. Their crimes are unforgivable. He Gonggan, Lin Zhifu, Chen Yaokun, and others are either remnants of the National Socialist Party or pawns of the Third Party. Their intentions are unpredictable and have long been despised by the elders. In particular, Sa Zhenbing, with a hypocritical charitable face, provides food to the bandits, engages in highway robbery, celebrates his success, deceives society, and proclaims himself a good person. If Qingfu is not eliminated, the troubles of Lu will not end. In addition to telegraphing the central government to promptly issue an order to arrest them all, we dare to hope that our fellow villagers will unanimously advocate for finding ways to detain them and prevent them from escaping justice, as a warning to traitors. We are extremely urgent. Fujian compatriots abroad bow in respect.</p>
<h3>Xu Baoqi Assumes Position as Deputy Manager of the Clearing House Yesterday</h3>
<p>Clearing House to Expand Business Scope</p>
<p>Inviting Local and Foreign Banks and Money Shops to Join</p>
<p>Xu Baoqi, the newly appointed deputy manager of the Shanghai Banks Joint Reserve Clearing House, officially took office at the Clearing House office of the Bankers Association at 10:00 AM yesterday, without any ceremony. Many leaders from the banking and money industries in Shanghai came to offer their congratulations. Mr. Xu is from Zhenze, Wujiang, Jiangsu. He entered the money industry at the age of thirty-four and served for eighteen years. After leaving the money industry, he served as deputy manager of the Bank of Communications for six years. Therefore, he has served in the financial industry for forty years, with rich experience and is highly respected in the industry. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Xu yesterday. According to him, the first bank in China was the China Merchants Bank. In recent years, it has gradually developed, and banks have sprung up in various ports. Therefore, the new business of the Clearing House is indispensable in fact. Having a clearing house to exchange bills for each bank saves time, is convenient, and can reduce various accidents. However, it is currently limited to the major banks in Shanghai and has not been popularized. In the future, we plan to expand the scope and hope that local money shops and foreign banks will join. At the same time, we also plan to cooperate with the banking and money industries in major cities to perfect the business of the banking and money industries in the future.</p>

<h3>Anti-Zhou Chuliang Movement at the Shanghai Public Hospital</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Public Hospital in the Nanshi district was reorganized in December last year and Zhou Chuliang was appointed acting president, internal unrest has emerged in the past three months. On New Year's Day, the dismissal of four clerks led to a police disturbance. Recently, there have been large-scale layoffs of medical personnel, many of whom are long-time employees of the hospital with qualifications and experience, trusted by their families. This has caused panic among the staff. Yesterday morning, all the doctors questioned him in unison to maintain the precedent of dismissal, which angered Zhou. He ordered the gatekeeper to close the iron gate, refusing patients to register. Later, directors Qin Yanqi, Huang Hanzhi, Yao Xinzhi, and Huang Yunshen held a meeting to mediate. Zhou said that he needed to consult Director Shen (Chief of the First Department of the Health Bureau), and then left. Now, all the doctors and pharmacists in the hospital have issued a declaration unanimously opposing Zhou Chuliang as president. The declaration is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Chuliang, with mediocre talent, uses his skills to ingratiate himself and takes the position of medical director of the Shanghai Public Hospital for almost eight years. In these eight years, he has done nothing, and everything has deteriorated. He is rarely seen feeling the pulse of patients or listening to their breathing. This is well known to everyone inside and outside the hospital and is not made up. However, he spends his days in petty scheming to enrich himself, and has done so for eight years. Being a medical director is a hard job with no great profit to be made. Therefore, he deliberately plotted to seize the position of business director. The board of directors was temporarily deceived by him the year before last and once handed over the position of business director to him to act concurrently, so that he could do whatever he wanted, and the hospital affairs deteriorated day by day. The board of directors heard about it and felt uneasy, and in the winter of the year before last, they appointed another person to replace the business director. Zhou still used various means to make the new person uneasy. The board of directors believed that in order to seek the development of the hospital, the regulations must be revised, and the two-head system must be changed to a president system to unify power. The board of directors had no intention of choosing a capable person to rectify the situation. Who knew that Zhou would see an opportunity to take advantage of and harbor great desires. On the day of the reorganization, he already colluded with the Department of Civil Affairs to protect him. When the board of directors proposed candidates for president, most of the directors advocated for the re-election of the president, but the government insisted on Zhou's trial for three months. It was said that there were disputes at the meeting that day, and some directors left in anger. Some said that the collective deliberation system of the board of directors had changed to a dictatorship of the government. If it were a normal person, who had received such support from the government, how would they inspire their conscience and work hard to repay the favor? But Zhou did not seek anything else, but only saw him placing his cronies in positions. On New Year's Day this year, on the day he took office as president, he first dismissed the clerical staff who were inconvenient for his private plans, using the excuse of streamlining, and dismissed them without following the hospital's six-month dismissal regulations, causing unexpected disputes. Recently, there have been similar hints to professional personnel in medicine and pharmacy. For the sake of reputation and personality, colleagues have had to question him about the matter. Zhou said that all facilities follow the orders of Director Shen. We believe that the hospital is organized by local public funds with a history and cannot be controlled by one or two people, let alone Director Shen. Moreover, colleagues have also met Director Shen, and Director Shen personally said that he had no such intention and declared that "people only seek the old." It is known that Zhou impersonated Director Shen. Moreover, colleagues have served in the hospital for more than twenty years, ten years, seven or eight years, or five or six years. Although the achievements of my responsibilities may not be so shocking that the world has seen them, but I tried my best to assist Zhou medical director, who could not diagnose the patient, seven or eight years, and asked myself without negative in Zhou. However, Zhou did not reflect on it, borrowed the government as a talisman, and oppressed him selflessly. For the sake of self-defense and the future of the hospital, my colleagues believes that Zhou Chuliang is really not suitable as the hospital's president. As for the colleague's position, there is no love, but Zhou's humble and petty, such a personality, such a segment, it must be to promote its introspection, this declaration, praying for the public's appreciation,</p>

<h3>A Cart of Milk Stolen</h3>

At about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a milkman from the company was delivering fresh milk in the Jing'an Temple Road area by bicycle. Because several customers lived in nearby alleys, he parked his bicycle at the entrance of the alleys and walked into the alleys to deliver the milk. When he finished delivering the milk and returned, the bicycle he had parked was gone, along with 106 bottles of fresh milk. The milkman had no choice but to rush back to the company to report the theft and request the police to investigate.

<h3>The Receiving and Dispatching Director of the Mobil Oil Company Embezzles More Than 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Using Account Funds for Personal Spending</p>
<p>The Huge Amount of Money Completely Spent</p>
<p>Hu Hongyun from Anhui was the receiving and dispatching director at the Mobil Oil Company at 11 Guangdong Road. Between November 7 and December 12, 1929, the Western manager gave him many checks to pay to various merchants. The value of these checks was 20,708.97 yuan. He suddenly had a bad thought and took the money separately and absconded without a trace. The company reported to the General Inspectorate and requested an investigation. It was discovered that Hu was hiding in his home and arrested, but he was not caught. A wanted warrant was signed by the First Special District Court and ordered to be arrested. It has been more than three years since then, and there has been no trace. On the 7th of this month, Chief Detective Pang Jinshan of the General Inspectorate suddenly learned that Hu was hiding at No. 37 Yanqing Lane, Dunjili in the city. He then met with Western Detective Ross and detectives from the Second Branch of the First District Public Security Bureau and went to the address to arrest Hu. He was brought back to the police station the day before yesterday. Under questioning, Hu confessed that he had embezzled the above-mentioned amount. However, he claimed that the money had been completely used up. He used 5,000 yuan to open the Zhongnan Huayang Grocery Store on Chengdu Road, 7,000 yuan was lost in the Liyuan roulette gambling den, 3,000 yuan was lost to dog racing, and 5,000 yuan was sent back to his home in Anhui. There was also 708.97 yuan that was spent in various small amounts. Yesterday morning, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the criminal court of the First Special Court, explained the case to the court, accusing him of embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. Because further investigation was required, he requested a postponement. Judge Feng Shide questioned the defendant and ordered a postponement of the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3>A Case of a Prostitute Being Shot by a Guest at Juhua Courtyard</h3>
<p>The Defendant and Witnesses Describe the Situation at the Time</p>
<p>Closing Arguments Completed, Sentencing Scheduled for the 15th</p>
<p>Chen Linrong, a native of Ningbo, who is a driver for the Wang family at 634 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, was 42 years old this year. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, he was invited by his friend Chen Lanfang to play with Lin Jinyuan (i.e., Juxian), a prostitute from Suzhou, in the pavilion on the second floor of the Juhua Courtyard at No. 2 Hongyun Lane, Huagenier Road in the French Concession. At 9 p.m. after dinner, Zhou Hongshan, a Chinese police officer from the British Concession No. 65, had an urgent need to go to the toilet. He took off his pistol and put it on the edge of the pillow on the bed. Chen saw it, took it out of curiosity to play with it, and because the safety was not on, he accidentally pulled the trigger. The bullet shot out and hit Lin, killing her. The French police took Chen to the Second Special District Court for prosecution, interrogation, and investigation. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Xiong Huiping was recommended to hold the trial in the First Criminal Court. The police brought all the witnesses at the scene for questioning. First, Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the police, explained the police's investigation. Then, Qian Ziqing, the adoptive father of the victim, stated the circumstances of his adopted daughter Lin Juxian being shot and killed. When Chen Linrong was interrogated, he confessed that he was invited by Chen Lanfang to play that day. He saw the pistol on the bed, and out of curiosity, he picked it up to play with it. He did not expect to accidentally pull the trigger, and the bullet flew out, hitting Lin. He immediately sent her to the hospital with Chen Lanfang and other friends, but she died despite treatment. The facts were unintentional, and he begged for leniency. Then, witness Zhou Hongshan testified that when he went to the toilet, he put his gun on the bed, fearing that someone would touch it, so he pinched one end of the belt in his hand. He did not expect Chen Linrong to take it out to play with it. He immediately stopped him and shouted that there were bullets in the gun and not to move it. At that time, someone else asked if the safety was on. He replied that it was not on. As soon as he finished speaking, he heard a gunshot, causing a great disaster, etc. At the end, after mutual arguments between the lawyer hired by the defendant and the police lawyer, the defendant's lawyer requested that the defendant be allowed to post bail. The court verified the statements and announced the end of the debate, scheduling the sentencing for the 15th. The defendant was allowed to stop the detention with a bail of 600 yuan. If no bail was paid, he would be held in custody pending instructions.</p>
<h3>The Fierce Momentum of the Women's Army Leads to a Tragic Fall from a Building</h3>
<p>He Jinbao's Life is in Danger</p>
<p>Ding Yuezhen's Methods are Ruthless</p>
<p>Yang Jiong, also known as Yang Yuqin, a native of Yin County, Zhejiang, is 34 years old and works for the Meiya Company. He owns an Austin car. He previously married Ding Lunsheng's daughter Ding Yuezhen, a local woman. Ding currently resides at No. 5 Nanyang Lane, North Zhejiang Road. However, Yang met He Jinbao, the main star of the Quntianfang Yang Lanchun brothel, who is 24 years old, two years ago, and found another golden house to hide her. Ding filed a lawsuit against Yang in the First Special District Court, accusing him of neglecting to provide support and seeking to recover living expenses. The court ordered them to separate, stipulating that Yang should give Ding 40 yuan per month for living expenses and that Ding should not interfere with Yang's actions. At 2:30 p.m. on the 9th, Ding suddenly led her father Ding Lunsheng, younger brother Ding Ziren, and more than ten other men and women in cars to Yang Jiong and his lover He Jinbao's golden house on the third floor of No. 77 Mingde Lane, broke into the house, and launched a punitive expedition, dragging He Jinbao and punching and kicking her. At the same time, they packed the soft and valuable items in the room into a large package, intending to take them outside. However, Ding still refused to stop and continued to beat He. Somehow, He suddenly fell out of the window and fell from the third floor, bleeding profusely and breathing weakly. Seeing that they had caused a disaster, Ding and the others went downstairs one after another and fled out the door. Ding, Ding Lunsheng, and Ding Ziren, the three main perpetrators, were caught by the patrolman in charge of the lane. Yang took He Jinbao to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment and reported to the French police. Detective Guo Shaorong arrested Ding and the other three defendants. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the defendants to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District for investigation. Judge Xiong Huicui held the trial. First, Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the police, explained the case, saying that the police had not yet investigated the case and that the victim He Jinbao was still recovering in the hospital. He requested a postponement and asked for an investigation after the victim had recovered from her injuries. He temporarily detained the defendants. Then, the plaintiff Yang Jiong stated the process of the defendants gathering people to commit violence. He also said that Ding was actually a concubine of a businessman and not his legal wife. The First Special District Court ruled for separation. He did not know how she suddenly came to make trouble unreasonably and pushed the businessman's concubine He Jinbao out of the window, causing her to fall and be seriously injured, and there was a risk of death. When he spoke, he thought of the tragic situation and burst into tears. The court stopped him before he stopped. When Ding Yuezhen was interrogated, she confessed that Yang Jiong was indeed her husband. After he abandoned her and her daughter, they sued in the First Special Court and reached a settlement, with 60 yuan per month given to the woman for living expenses, which was later reduced to 40 yuan. However, he had not paid a penny for several months recently. Not only did he ignore her when she asked for it, but he also went to the woman's place on the morning of the 7th and falsely accused her of having an affair with someone, slapping her twice and leaving. The woman was angry and went to argue with him alone. She did not dare to gather people to commit violence. Ding Lunsheng and Ding Ziren, father and son, confessed together that Ding Yuezhen first went to tell them about the situation, and they rushed over after hearing about it. They did not commit any violence. The court verified the confessions and ordered the defendants to be held in custody and the hearing to be continued on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi and His Wife Raise Funds for the Xijing Midwifery School</h3>
<p>Since their arrival in Shaanxi, Chairman Shao Lizi of Shaanxi Province and his wife, Ms. Fu Xuewen, have diligently sought to understand the people's hardships. They learned that the mortality rate of women and children was higher than that of men due to poor midwifery. Therefore, they used their personal funds to establish the Xijing Midwifery School, which has already opened. However, due to a lack of funding, its long-term sustainability is uncertain. They have published a donation appeal to solicit donations from philanthropists. The appeal states that Shaanxi has suffered from frequent disasters in recent years, leading to a sharp decline in population. There are many ways to seek relief, but the promotion and implementation of midwifery education are particularly urgent. It is observed that in folk customs, when childbirth occurs, ignorant old women are often employed to undertake the important task of delivery. These old women lack basic physiological knowledge, let alone midwifery skills. As for disinfection and prevention, etc., they are beyond their wildest dreams. In cases of difficult labor, they recklessly use barbaric procedures. If successful, they demand credit and reward. If unsuccessful, they attribute it to fate, causing widespread harm and treating human life as mere grass. The situation is too tragic to describe. A small number of wealthy families who are aware of the drawbacks seek help from hospitals, but even they often refuse to be examined by male doctors, causing delays in treatment. As for the general populace, they have no choice but to follow the customs and entrust the lives of mothers and children to the hands of ignorant old women. This is a major scourge on humanity and a hidden danger for the nation. Having recognized this, we have initiated the Xijing Midwifery School, which specifically recruits female students from various counties and teaches them midwifery knowledge. The aim is to spread this knowledge throughout the province in the future, pass it on from generation to generation, protect the lives of mothers and infants, reduce the panic surrounding population problems, and provide some relief for women's employment. However, establishing the school is only the first step. It is even more important to maintain it in the long run. To ensure its long-term sustainability, raising funds is essential to strengthen its foundation. We have limited resources and are making this appeal in the hope that benevolent people at home and abroad will act courageously, generously donate, and help us achieve this goal. We sincerely express our gratitude on behalf of the millions of people in Guanzhong for their future lives and hope for your kind consideration.</p>
<h3>Notice on Vehicle Tax Collection in the City Area</h3>
<p>Spring Tax Payment Deadline</p>
<p>January 20th</p>
<p>In this city, it is stipulated that motor vehicles must obtain new vehicle licenses from the Public Works Bureau in the spring, and then pay vehicle tax to the Finance Bureau with the new license. Recently, the renewal of licenses and tax payment have been very active. However, because it involves two procedures, it takes a little longer than other seasons. To avoid congestion for taxpayers, the Finance Bureau has temporarily added staff to assist in tax collection to speed up the process. Moreover, the office is open as usual on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, which is very convenient for taxpayers. It is also reported that due to the three-day New Year holiday in the spring, the deadline for tax payment has been extended to January 20th. Starting from the 21st, vehicle licenses will be inspected to prevent tax evasion.</p>
<h3>Method for Calculating Freight Transport per Ton</h3>
<p>Calculate the Total Amount First, Then Round to the Cent Place</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways issued a directive to the Railway Bureau yesterday, stating that according to the Third Congress Proposal A36 of the Unified Railway Accounting and Statistics Committee, the freight rate per ton for passenger and freight transport on each route should be calculated to the cent place or a certain decimal point below the cent place.

The bureau has instructed the Transportation Department to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>The 20th Anniversary Memorial Service for Xia Ruifang, Founder of the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Held Yesterday Morning at the Cemetery on Shuidaian Road</p>
<p>Xia Ruifang, the founder of the Commercial Press, was a native of Qingpu, Jiangsu. He was murdered on January 10th of the third year of the Republic of China at the age of 43. Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Xia's death. His son, Xia Xiaofang (the current manager of the Commercial Press), held a 20th-anniversary memorial service at the cemetery on Shuidaian Road to express his condolences. The entire family, children, and more than twenty old employees of the Commercial Press from 20 years ago, including Wei Fuqing, Shi Jiuyun, Huang Jingwan, Li Fuchen, Xie Binlai, and Zhao Lianchen, attended to offer flowers and pay their respects. They also recalled the difficulties of Xia's entrepreneurship and the progress after the revival. According to a reporter from the "Shenshi Society," Xia studied at Qingxin Middle School in his youth. Later, he entered Tongren Hospital, but he did not succeed in studying medicine. He then went to the Dahui News Agency to learn typesetting. After accumulating some savings, he and his colleagues Gao Hanqing, Bao Xianchang, and others raised a capital of 4,700 yuan to establish the Commercial Press on Beijing Road. At that time, the building was only one floor. The first English textbook published was "Hua Ying Chu Jie" (Chinese-English Primer), and the first textbook was "Latest National Language Textbook." Today, the business has developed into the only organization in China that promotes culture and enjoys a worldwide reputation. Remembering Xia's spirit of hard work and outstanding achievements, he is truly worthy of admiration.</p>
<h3>Cold Weather in This City</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the weather in this city has been very mild. The Fahrenheit thermometer has often been between 50 and 60 degrees. Therefore, pedestrians on the road have found cotton clothes to be too warm, and most wear lined jackets and velvet long gowns. After a slight snowfall the day before yesterday (the evening of the 7th), the weather remained as warm as before. Unexpectedly, from 1:00 PM yesterday, the northwest wind howled, and the weather suddenly became bitterly cold. After nightfall, the temperature dropped below zero, and ice formed under the water boards of the stoves.</p>
<h3>World-Renowned Anatomist Visits the Children's Dental Hospital</h3>
<p>Professor Dr. Julius Tandler, a world-renowned anatomy expert from the University of Vienna, has been invited by the Medical School of Central University to lecture in China. Dr. Tandler is an expert in anatomy and is known throughout the world. Whenever he gives a lecture, audiences of four to five thousand people come uninvited. His admiration in the scientific community can be imagined. This invitation from Central University is truly a rare event. He recently passed through Shanghai and heard that the Family Industrial Society had newly established a Children's Dental Hospital, and that all the equipment was a model for China. He specifically asked Mr. Zhou Shangjun of the Education Bureau to introduce him. Yesterday, he personally visited the hospital on Nanjing Road. Dr. Gu Hailing, the director of the hospital, received and showed him around. The doctor carefully examined the hospital's consultation room, operating room, electrotherapy room, and the latest X-ray machine, and praised them highly. He believed that such dental equipment was no less than that in Europe and America.</p>

<h3>Discounting Drafts and Freight Transport by Zheng, Bao, Zhao</h3>
<p>｜A Great Opportunity for Cooperation Between Banks and Railways｜</p>
<p>The purpose of railways in handling freight business is to circulate goods and help the development of the social economy. Most of our country's railways are state-owned and state-operated. The freight business should especially be based on serving society. Compared to passenger transport, which should facilitate travel, the mission is even more important. Because a country's wealth, strength, and weakness are often based on the rise and fall of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the capital for the turnover and circulation of agriculture, industry, and commerce is goods. Therefore, inconvenient freight transport is the main reason for the inability to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce. If agriculture, industry, and commerce do not develop, the country cannot become rich and strong. Looking at the cheap, fast, and prosperous railway freight transport in various countries in the East and West, it is enough to know the source of their wealth and strength. Its great mission cannot be regarded as trivial.</p>
<p>The operation of state-owned railways and its business is not aimed at seeking profits. Therefore, all kinds of businesses that can facilitate society, with very thin profits or even no profits, should also be given priority. In the past, although our country's railways were state-owned, they mostly ignored the end of serving society. Therefore, they often failed to penetrate into the people and seek convenience for the masses. Taking freight transport as an example, merchants often felt inconvenience and suffered greatly. Therefore, intermediaries emerged in response to the situation. People were willing to pay unnecessary prices in order to obtain a deserved convenience. The reason for this is that railways did not have a correct concept of business policy, believing that railway transportation is mostly monopolistic in nature. No matter how inconvenient or expensive it is, merchants must have no other way to go. All the places that can facilitate society are considered superfluous and have nothing to do with the business of railways. How can they know that the purpose of railway business is not only to seek their own interests?</p>
<p>Now, the railway authorities, in view of the errors in the past business policy, are eager to penetrate into society, seek happiness for merchants, seek convenience, lighten burdens, and do not take their own interests as a prerequisite, but take the interests of society as the basis. Recently, various routes have created railway business offices to handle all passenger and freight transportation procedures on behalf of customers. The intention is here. The business office is purely a service organization run by the railway itself, and it is also the external representative of the railway business. All services are based on the purpose of serving society, and it is not the responsibility of seeking profits. It can also penetrate into agriculture, industry, and commerce to solve all transportation problems for merchants, eliminate their pain, and reduce their burdens, sweeping away the bad habits of closing the door for business, being arrogant and self-respecting. This is the latest innovation in railway business.</p>
<p>As far as consignment is concerned, the railway business office can already pick up and deliver goods on behalf of customers, handle all freight transportation procedures, answer questions from all walks of life about freight rates at any time, and do its best to solve various freight transportation difficulties for customers within its ability. Society calls it convenient, and the effect has been achieved. However, the railway handles freight transport with the aim of circulating goods, as has been said above. The method of circulating goods, in addition to transportation convenience, still depends on the flexibility of transportation finance. Because the goods are transported from A to B, it is the formation of buying and selling transactions. The result of the transaction is the liquidation of the price of the goods. There are various methods for liquidating the price of the goods: (1) The buyer carries cash to purchase. (2) The buyer carries a bill to discount for purchase. (3) The seller remits the money in advance before the transaction is completed. (4) The seller only reconciles after the transaction is completed. All of this requires paying the money first and then purchasing the goods, or delivering the goods first and then receiving the money, which is inconvenient for the buyer or unfavorable to the seller. Only the method of discounting drafts can take care of both parties and benefit them. Even if the buyer and seller do not know each other, they can complete their transaction by means of discounting drafts. This is a good method for flexible transport finance. If the railway wants to fulfill its mission of circulating goods and helping the development of the social economy, it must not only facilitate transport, but also assist in the flexibility of transport finance. Otherwise, the development of many freight transports will be impossible because of this.</p>
<p>Now that the railway has established business offices to be the vanguard of serving society, in the future, if it wants to be able to do its best to serve society in terms of freight transport, it must handle discounting drafts to regulate transport finance. Although discounting drafts is one of the important businesses of banks, if the railway business office wants to engage in discounting drafts, it still needs the assistance of the banking industry before it can develop. Therefore, the purpose of the banking business is also to serve society and facilitate the people, which is exactly the same as the railway. Bankers should also have the perseverance and crude spirit to penetrate society and make real investments before they can achieve the goal of helping production. We say that the discounting drafts is a great opportunity for cooperation between banks and railways. The railway has a business office to handle all freight transport procedures, and can directly handle discounting drafts with the bank to meet the needs of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The method is very simple, that is, whenever a customer entrusts the railway business office to transport the</p>
<p>goods, if discounting drafts is required, the business office will open a bill of lading to the freight station, (the bill of lading is different from the freight receipt, the former can be transferred and can be discounted, the latter cannot be transferred or discounted according to the regulations,) the name of the discounting bank is filled in the consignee column of the bill of lading, the bill of lading is transferred to the bank handling discounting drafts, the discounted money is obtained, and transferred to the consignor. The method is simple and the effect is great. It is truly a new business that banks and railways should handle.</p>
<p>The railway has made efforts to penetrate into social services and not seek its own interests as an effort to reform. We hope that the banking industry will also adopt this spirit and quickly cooperate with the railway to seek common prosperity. The way of cooperation can start from the above-mentioned discounting drafts method. We ask the gentlemen in the financial industry, what do you think?</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, On the 10th of this month, I saw a news item in your newspaper's local news column about our company's construction of a tramway track. It stated that the electricity business in the 22nd year was quite developed and that it was estimated that a surplus of more than one million yuan could be obtained. I was extremely surprised to read this. After checking, although the electricity business of our company in the 22nd year was better compared to the 21st year, the expenses also increased a lot compared to the previous year. How could there be such a large surplus? I am afraid that outsiders will not be aware of this and will easily be misled. Therefore, I am specifically sending this letter to your editor for verification and request that this letter be published in the letter column to correct the misinformation and avoid its spread. I would be very grateful. Sincerely, The Chief Editor of the Shenbao Editorial Department, Huashang Electric Company, 231.10.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>"Reading Guidance" (1)</p>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>I am very happy that there is a "Reading Guidance" creation in the Chinese Library. This is indeed a very educational thing. Your success will definitely exceed school education. Because not everyone gathered in a school is interested in studying, but those who flock around you are for their own interests and needs, a large group of people starving for knowledge who need nourishment, and they do not need to be forced.</p>
<p>I am very satisfied with the "Reading Q&amp;A" of the past two days. Although the discussion is still about general issues, it is still very needed. Now I will put forward a more practical working question under your guidance.</p>
<p>I don't think your guidance should be exclusively for books, and especially should not teach people to simply read books. Because I think that those who are currently receiving your guidance are probably struggling to make a living while trying to learn something to cope with the needs of actual life. If you, based on your subjective views, offer them a grand list of books, write a few large volumes of someone's self-study introduction, and talk about the evolution and system of academics, it is really irrelevant to everyone. At most, it is just like Hu Shi, Liang Qichao, and others offering a list of Chinese studies books to students. These delicacies are only intimidating and deceiving, not "non-</p>
<p>refugee" food.</p>
<p>I mean, the center of your guidance should pay attention to the current practical life of readers, and give practical instructions and assistance to solve the difficulties that occur in various daily lives. Because this is the goal, guiding reading becomes a means. Therefore, I think that your work simply should not or does not need to be done grandly and impressively, but should be done calmly, practically, silently, and inconspicuously. What you should always pay attention to is life guidance, not cramming knowledge, or classical sermons in church. Therefore, the books you recommend do not need to be systematic or talk about evolution, as long as they can be used for reference to solve a certain problem. The simplicity and lack of system of the book list can be ignored. Do not regard books as sacred, and do not regard reading as a great undertaking. You yourself do not need to become scholars in the study. This is what I hope. If you can do this, your work will not be in vain, everyone will need you, and naturally this is a great project.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, the difficulties in the future are probably much more difficult than running a university. However, reading your plan carefully, it has a tendency to coincide with my humble opinion. Therefore, I cherish it very much and cannot help but say it. I hope you will pay more attention and show everyone your work direction more concretely, so that everyone can thoroughly understand it, so that they can supervise each other and make this unprecedented undertaking more practical.</p>
<p>Do not block everyone's opinions, but sincerely absorb the true shadow of each social level of life. Have the determination and care of a scientist to dissect it, the faith of a religious person to seek to change this bad sin and animality, and at the same time, the courtesy, patience, and needs of an elementary school teacher to interact with the people who need you.</p>
<p>Your success and failure lie in your understanding of the depth of everyone; whether you get the support of sympathetic people and the cooperation of all readers. My direct suggestion is for your reference only. Finally, I hope that this issue will also be made public in the "Reading Q&amp;A" to arouse everyone's research.</p>

<h3>Telephone Bureau Expands Wusong Lines</h3>
<p>Longhua Automatic Machine Conversion Can Be Completed in April</p>
<p>Increased Telephone Calls in Chinese Concession Will Expand Switchboard</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has decided to expand the Wusong lines due to insufficient application. As for the conversion of Longhua's automatic machine, the expansion of the No. 0 switchboard, and the removal of cross-border phones, it will be completed in the summer of this year. The leased telephone company will add a No. 04 manual exchange, which is scheduled to be completed on February 10th. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Wusong Increase Lines</h3>
<p>There are 33 telephone users in Wusong. All telephones are directly under the jurisdiction of the Jiangwan Telephone Branch. Because the city situation in the district is not prosperous, the telephone bureau only laid three lines from Wusong to the Jiangwan branch. In theory, three lines are enough for the application of more than 30 households. However, because it needs to be transferred, there are often delays. All sectors of the area have repeatedly requested to re-equip and increase the lines. For the convenience of users, the telephone bureau decided to expand two lines, which can be completed in mid-February.</p>
<h3>Longhua Exchange Machine</h3>
<p>In Longhua, the market is becoming more prosperous day by day, and the number of telephone users is also increasing day by day. The Longhua Telephone Bureau originally had a branch office. All the phones were switchboards and were old. Therefore, the telephone bureau had discussed the conversion of automatic machines and submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for review. The Ministry has approved it and ordered the material purchase committee to order new automatic machines from the United States. It will arrive in Shanghai in March, and it will be supplied to users in the Longhua area. The disassembly and installation can be completed in mid-April.</p>
<h3>Pudong Rent</h3>
<p>As for the telephone in Pudong, since the establishment of a telephone branch by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau on November 30 last year in accordance with the telephone temporary contract and the telephone company's negotiation, and the transfer of management by the telephone bureau, the prices have been stipulated. The monthly rent for each residential unit is ten yuan, and the monthly rent for each business is fifteen yuan. The residents of the area found that the telephone rental fees in the Jiangwan, Nanshi, Zhabei, Zhenru, and Longhua telephone bureaus were seven yuan and ten yuan. Pudong is also in the urban area, but the price is expensive, so they requested a reduction. The telephone bureau took into account that the telephone company's charges for installing cross-border machines were almost twice as high as those in the leased area due to the submarine cable. It had requested instructions from the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry advocated that the current price should still be collected.</p>
<h3>Expand Number Zero</h3>
<p>The Telephone Bureau's "Number Zero" switchboard has been increased more than doubled by users in each district who call to the leased area since the cancellation of the five-cent telephone fee in the Chinese Concession at the end of August last year. Especially between 12:00 noon and 2:00 pm, calls to the leased area are even busier, and there is almost no time to answer them. For this reason, the Telephone Bureau specifically approved the Ministry of Communications to ask the Material Purchase Committee to order the machine parts of the switchboard from the United States in order to expand the Number Zero switchboard for telephone calls in the Chinese Concession. Now the goods will arrive in Shanghai in May, and the Number Zero switchboard can be expanded in mid-June.</p>
<h3>Dismantle Cross-Border Machines</h3>
<p>After dismantling 30 of the 288 cross-border phones installed by the Shanghai Telephone Company in various parts of the Chinese Concession since September last year, the Telephone Bureau had to wait for the expansion before it could completely dismantle them due to insufficient machine parts. The Shanghai Telephone Company found that the No. 02 manual switchboard for calls to the Chinese Concession was very busy, so it decided to open a "No. 04" manual switchboard specifically for renting calls to Pudong (because most Pudong telephones call the leased area). Construction has now started and is expected to be completed on February 10th and can be applied on the 20th. After the establishment of this station, the Pudong cross-border machine will be transferred to the Telephone Bureau for processing. The cross-border machines in various places must be transferred to the Telephone Bureau after the "Zero" station is expanded. The time is around the end of June.</p>

<h3>The Required Work of Women's National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Yang Yao</p>
<p>This year has already been officially designated as Women's National Products Year. For women, it is naturally an unshirkable duty, and for men, it is necessary to work together to promote its success. It is essential not to think, "This year's promotion of national products can be left to the women to handle." Therefore, an organized Women's National Products Year Work Plan Committee was established to handle the planning. As a reporter, I was also pushed as part of the plan. Thus, I boldly present my personal thoughts here for the reference of enthusiastic individuals.</p>
<p>㈠ The principals and teachers of all girls' schools should lead their students in national products movements, starting from the school, then the family, and then society. Using speeches, talks, visits, and persuasive methods, they should proceed separately, ensuring that families and society across the country are consistently using domestic goods. If anyone in the school uses foreign goods or Japanese goods, classmates should report them and publicly display it throughout the school as a great disgrace.</p>
<p>㈡ Female university students are the leaders of the women's world nationwide. Starting this year, everyone should unite to serve national products and advocate for them throughout the country. Eradicate the previous habit of loving foreign goods and extravagance. Everyone should have the ambition to "transform the atmosphere; if not me, then who?"</p>
<p>㈢ Various women's groups, such as the Young Women's Christian Association, Women's Temperance Union, Family Renewal Association, Women's National Products Promotion Association, and women's associations, should unite to form a Women's National Products Year Committee. They should hold women's forums, social gatherings, and festive events at any time, and plan the work to be done during the Women's National Products Year.</p>
<p>㈣ All national products groups and national products companies should receive local women at any time, hold tea parties, social gatherings, etc., to exchange opinions with each other, so that the women's world has a deeper understanding of national products and a more sincere belief in them.</p>
<p>㈤ All national products companies, factories, and shops, on their storefront signs, covers, invoices, advertisements, leaflets, and gift certificates, can add the words "Women's National Products Year" so that customers always keep it in mind and never forget it.</p>
<p>㈥ All national products groups and national products companies should hold mobile national products exhibitions, rotating to various universities and girls' schools to display their products and provide explanations to attract the attention of students.</p>
<p>㈦ All theaters and cinemas should screen films promoting national products movements before the show begins and write prominently on the screen "Women's National Products Year, please women's circles to consistently use national products".</p>
<p>㈧ All national products companies, factories, and major newspapers should hold Women's National Products Year essay and speech contests to encourage women and female students to focus their energy, thought, and attention on national products issues.</p>
<p>㈨ All silk companies, woolen companies, national cloth companies, etc., should hold women's clothing or children's clothing conventions at any time to encourage women and children's interest in using national fabric materials.</p>
<p>㈩ On Children's Day this year, all national products companies should hold mothers' meetings, inviting mothers to lead their children to visit and talk, or use gift drawing methods to add interest.</p>
<p>㈩㈠ All national products companies and national products groups should collect domestic goods for household and women's use, classify them, and publish small booklets to facilitate housewives' choices.</p>
<p>㈩㈡ All broadcasting stations, regardless of the program, should insert Women's National Products Year information to make it known to every household and have a greater effect.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned is just my humble opinion; there is much other work that needs to be done. "Good government lies not in many words, but in earnest action." I hope that women's circles across the country will use a spirit of hard work, perseverance, and practicality to consistently implement this work to complete the significant mission of this year.</p>
<p>National Products Talk</p>
<h3>Prospects for "Women's National Products Year"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Since the curtain of "Women's National Products Year" was unveiled, the call for "Women's National Products" can be said to have permeated the country. Although we have not yet seen how they are actually implementing it and what results they are achieving, in the face of the influx of foreign goods and the soaring trade deficit, it is naturally something for the whole country to celebrate that our national products future can have such enthusiastic advocacy.</p>
<p>Originally, the establishment of a country is based on individuals and families, from families to society, and from society to the nation. Of course, his prosperity and decline depends on the quality of the national economy. In the past, my country | was shrouded in the evil atmosphere of imperialism, the market situation naturally only presented darkness and disorder. The tide of foreign goods dumping and increasing trade deficit was rampant day by day, and the storm of rural bankruptcy and market depression swept the country. However, under this severe lesson, our national products industry has been able to rise roughly in recent years. However, the influx of foreign goods remains, and the adoption of foreign goods by Chinese people also remains. The great National Products Year finally failed to wash away the disgrace of a new record of 900 million yuan in trade deficit but urgently needs and waits for the continued efforts of the "Women's National Products Year" to achieve his ambitions, which is really pitiful and ridiculous.</p>
<p>The fact is very clear: in the past, Chinese women, especially the so-called modern girls in cities, ignored national products and were happy to promote foreign goods, which are undeniable facts. Last year, the import of cosmetics to Shanghai alone was reportedly 600,000 yuan. A large amount of money is flowing out. Since women are housewives and in charge of household affairs, they have such outrageous behavior. It is no wonder that the national products industry’s promotion and advocacy, running around and working hard, are all counterproductive and rarely achieve results. It is urgently necessary for our "womenfolk to do it" in the hope of better results.</p>
<p>The year has been renewed, and the climax of my "Women's National Products" is also beginning to surge at the same time. From now on, the women's circles of the entire country will also follow this new year, realize the mistakes of the past, work hard for the future, and unite and stand on the same line. Starting this year, set an example, use national products, no matter a thread or a thread, only buy domestic goods, revealing a ray of light from the dull air, and strive to eliminate foreign goods, permanently block loopholes, and revive the countryside.</p>
<p>Society can be stable, creating unprecedented feats in the women's world and completing the most important mission of this year.</p>
<h3>Welcoming "Women's National Products Year"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Amidst the surrounding groans and cries, our solemn and great National Products Year has passed away leisurely and ordinarily, just like in previous years. However, the brand-new and beautiful Women's National Products Year, which has been named by all circles and approved by the government, has already arrived slowly. As people bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, they naturally have a new ambition, new hope, and something to pray for regarding this new year.</p>
<p>The National Products Year of the 22nd year | in the past year, our entire country can be said to be in a state of darkness. Outside, strong neighbors are pressing the border, and the loss of land is increasing day by day. Inside, the countryside is bankrupt, and the social economy is collapsing. The most painful thing is that the new record of 900 million yuan in trade deficit is still reflected in my great National Products Year. Looking at various places in the country, foreign goods are rampant, especially the activities of enemy goods, even resorting to despicable behaviors and dirty methods, colluding with unscrupulous merchants, and dumping goods wantonly, inducing my people with weak purchasing power to get hooked and be exploited again. This situation is the greatest obstacle to the future of my national products and urgently needs to be eradicated fundamentally and prevent it from spreading and expanding day by day.</p>
<p>Although, the past is not worth regretting, we only need to hope for the future. The National Products Year cannot completely block the loopholes in foreign goods imports, but, in this year, the people in my national products industry have been running around and working hard, promoting and advocating, and have indeed created many glorious achievements. The most notable ones are the establishment of the China National Products Company, the establishment of the National Products Introduction Office and its branches in various places, and the establishment of various national products gatherings, which have made the national products production and sales mechanism universal throughout the country. Indeed, all of these are the dawn of the future of my national products and the beginning of industrial revitalization, which is enough to make us excited, enthusiastic, and self-motivated, and strive to continue and complete the tasks of the end of last year this year.</p>
<p>The naming of this year has been determined | The meaning and origin of "Women's National Products Year" must have been known to my people. As Mr. Yang Yao said: "Who controls the vitality of national products? The power lies entirely in the hands of women." Starting this year, my housewives who are in charge of household affairs can truly promote national products, be happy to use them, and no longer be salespeople for foreign goods. Then, this year will surely have better results and achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>At this time, in the midst of the noisy and lively sound of gongs and drums, the women's circles of the entire country do not want to be blurred by colorful New Year cards, but have a clear understanding of this year, and it will be seen that foreign goods will disappear, loopholes will be permanently blocked, and a different color will be released for the future of national products. This is the only hope for my people today.</p>
<h3>Contribution Words Before Famous Actors Take the Stage</h3>
<p>— Lu Boyu</p>
<p>From the National Products Year last year to the Women's National Products Year this year, the national products movement is gradually becoming more acute. This cannot but be said to be a good phenomenon for the future of my country's industry. Taking theater as an example, last year's National Products Year was a well-done "Tiao Jia Guan" or "Havoc in the Theatre." This year is the main play. The Women's National Products Year, of course, takes women as the main characters. The roles of male, female, painted face, clown, and supporting actor are almost entirely played by women. The responsibility of men is to play supporting roles, waving flags and shouting to boost the momentum. It is certainly not good if the supporting actors' steps are wrong, but if the singing and acting skills of the main characters are inappropriate or uneasy, or even out of tune, the audience under the stage may boo!</p>
<p>We are all people in the play, and at the same time, we are all audience members. Last year, we performed a national products play for a year. Although the results were not very satisfactory, they were generally still satisfactory. Unfortunately, at the end of the year, a message suddenly came that the import of cosmetics amounted to 1.4 million yuan in ten months. This is like the actors in the theater are performing happily, and suddenly a large number of female viewers leave their seats. It is really a big disappointment. The opening play in the past is no longer discussed. This year, we start all over again. The famous actors invited this year have always been appealing. We hope that after this large group of famous actors take the stage, they will work tirelessly to make the audience under the stage applaud repeatedly, and make the "sold out" sign hang early at the entrance of the theater, and make the theater next door deserted and sparsely populated. This will not only satisfy the audience and make the boss happy, but also make the stagehands and tea servers in the theater very grateful to these famous actors, so that they can get more tips. As for the actors, if they always work hard, they can certainly get many cheers on the spot, and then they will become famous, so that the general public will recognize the abilities of these famous actors, increase the status of these famous actors in the art world, and at the same time, they will not disappoint the hard work of the theater owners who have spent a lot of advertising fees on promotion.</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3>Promoting National Products and Improving Customs</h3>
<p>— Li Anfu</p>
<p>The strength or weakness of a country is not limited to one aspect, but in this era when the economy can control everything, only the economy is omnipotent; even politics must be based on economic strength to determine its direction. Therefore, it is really a blessing for a country to not allow its money to flow out as much as possible within its capabilities, and to make the country feel an economic panic. (Naturally, it is different from the capital export of imperialism.) But looking back at China, the construction of all heavy industries must rely on foreign countries. Even the manufactured products of light industries, as well as cosmetics, etc., mostly use foreign goods and consider it an honor. Therefore, in the National Products Year of the 22nd year, not only did the sales rate of anti-national products not increase as much as possible, but the foreign goods of other countries took this opportunity to impersonate national products and dumped them heavily. The future of the national products industry has fallen further and further. Tracing back to its origin, of course, it is because national products are unable to sell well.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step we should study is how to make national products sell well? Naturally, advertisements in newspapers, shouting slogans, and posters on walls only create an atmosphere of promoting national products. In reality, its effect is still very small. Therefore, we have to make further inspections and discussions. Observing from the perspective of various countries, only by reforming these bad customs and human hearts can there be a remedy; because promoting national products as a formality really does not have much effect. If the power of the country is used to force people to adopt national products, it is indeed difficult to implement in reality. Therefore, we have to use these customs and habits to improve them. In the past history, there are many such examples. Even judging from what we see now, Japan is a good example. Although Japanese women wear colorful clothes and dress up gorgeously, what they use and wear are all their own national products. Japanese students also take pride in wearing national uniforms. Other daily necessities, etc., are not bought unless they are domestic products. I remember once, a friend told me that the Japanese living in Shanghai even brought their soy sauce from Japan. From this very small place, we can see how strong the patriotism of the Japanese is! The people of Germany also love to use domestic goods no less than Japan. This is also a major reason why their country can be strong.</p>
<p>This year is the "Women's National Products Year". The promoters really spent a lot of psychological speculation before deciding on this name, but it is difficult to say whether it will be effective; because women's psychology is mostly fond of vanity and luxury. As long as the things she chooses are beautiful and attractive, she often takes out money to buy them, regardless of whether they are domestic or foreign goods; and women with relatively lower intelligence? They often lack the ability to choose for themselves, and only know how to imitate others. They buy whatever they see others buy; moreover, the household utensils and items used by the husband are mostly handled by women, except for special items. Therefore, once this trend starts, there will be no day to promote national products. If we can change this bad habit and make up our minds not to buy anything other than national products, then it is naturally not difficult to reform this trend. Moreover, the so-called fashionable and modern are also aimless and follow the trend. If it is considered fashionable to use national products at home, then who would use foreign goods? Moreover, promoting national products only requires changing the purpose of shopping, and it is not a difficult thing. If the facts can really match the ideals, then national products will be promoted without promotion, and foreign goods will be excluded without exclusion. At that time, part of the money will not flow out.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to promote national products, we must start with female compatriots, and women should especially reform this luxurious custom first; then create a good custom, so that good results can be produced. I hope that female compatriots do not think that this is an ordinary thing | and falsely live up to the good name of this "Women's National Products Year."</p>
<p>Women and National Products Talk Forum</p>
<h3>A Message to Ladies!</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>It's your time to shine this year</p>
<p>When many friends get together, the topics they talk about are nothing more than the following: ㈠ Their own career problems ㈡ Trivial matters between families ㈢ National products issues.</p>
<p>The former is beyond the scope of this publication, so I won't add much more. As for the third item? We don't talk about it unless we have to. Once we start talking, everyone seems very pessimistic about the national products movement, and they say in unison: "Women are really the salespeople of foreign goods and the enemies of national products..." Some more radical friends even say: "The enemies of national products are not foreigners, not Japan, but women..." Alas! This argument seems excessive when you hear it, but if you analyze it carefully, it is not wrong. Just look at what was published in the newspaper last year, the trade surplus for foreign perfumes and cosmetics alone has exceeded 14 million yuan. Other expenses such as clothing are not included. If all the foreign goods used by women are calculated together, the number must be astonishing. Therefore, promoting national products must start with women. It is the only method, the only way!</p>
<p>Okay, this year is the Women's National Products Year, and women's rights are above all else. This year, women will lead the national products movement! This is such a sweet piece of news, a great feat, worth reporting to female compatriots.</p>
<p>In the past, whenever we talked about promoting national products, we had to scold women. This year, it is time for women, ladies, young women and female students to shine! May you work hard from now on, eliminate all your past actions of using foreign goods, and reform your psychology of believing in foreign goods together. From this year on, all women must have a determination to only use national products and only buy national products. It must be from top to bottom, from inside to outside, up and down, inside and out, all national products. Only in this way can women fulfill their responsibilities and be a good woman who stands tall, loves her family, loves her country, loves herself, and loves others:</p>
<p>Women, this is your time to shine! Please work hard from now on?</p>
<h3>Believe It or Not</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>㈠ Foreword</p>
<p>From National Products Year to Women's National Products Year, the fact is that it's just changing the medicine without changing the soup; however, why do we have to do this again? To open the window and speak frankly, the situation is urgent, how can we not rely on the great efforts of the ladies! Although this is an old tune, believe it or not, facts speak louder than words, how can you not believe it?</p>
<p>㈡ Seasoning Aircraft</p>
<p>We must know that every meal and every bowl of porridge does not come easily. Even apart from the oil, salt, firewood, and rice, let's just talk about seasoning powder. In the wave of saving the country through aviation, there was the appearance of a "Heavenly Chef" airplane. The small things, just a spoonful at a time, actually contain so much truth.</p>
<p>㈢ Saving the Country through Makeup</p>
<p>Saving the country through dancing has been attacked as a ridiculous act, but applying powder and rouge also has some meaning. It is said that the expenses of our ladies add up to an astonishing amount. If we don't give it to the French "Coty" (the king of cosmetics) who insult China, or if we don't abandon the lead and use only national products, we must recover part of the leakage.</p>
<p>㈣ Night Clothes and Slippers</p>
<p>Who dares to tell people not to wear clothes and shoes! However, fashion does not only refer to things tailored from imported goods. High-heeled shoes and long silk stockings have contributed to the fat of several countries and nations. Fortunately, we don't have to learn from Gandhi to wear Indian homespun cloth. There are many domestic products that do have real evidence in terms of price and quality.</p>
<p>㈤ Sugar, Wine, and Poison</p>
<p>Let me tell you, eating foreign sugar, smoking foreign cigarettes, and drinking foreign wine not only wastes your personal economy, but also causes a major loss to the national economy. There is an idiom to prove it: "Drinking poison to quench thirst"?</p>

<h3>Women's National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>This year is "Women's National Products Year," and now is the beginning of "Women's National Products Year." On the beginning of "Women's National Products Year," people generally give auspicious speeches, hoping that "Women's National Products Year" can become "Women's National Products Year." However, instead of giving auspicious speeches, it is better to review our own mistakes so that we can learn from them in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is written here is not auspicious speeches but self-criticism. Although the author is not a woman but a man.</p>
<p>It is undeniable, and there is no denying that Chinese women have made many mistakes in the past.</p>
<p>Taking cosmetics as an example, according to the Guidance Office of the International Trade Bureau, the imports of perfumes, powders, and other cosmetics from various countries this year have reached 1,398,664 yuan (the above was reported on December 5, and the number will probably be higher by the end of the year.)</p>
<p>At the same time, let us look at what the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported on November 29:</p>
<p>Recently, among the products imported from Japan, the most prominent are miscellaneous goods, and among miscellaneous goods, mirrors are the most numerous. Every time a ship arrives, there are always 30 to 40 boxes, or even more than 50 boxes. The cargo ships that arrived this month totaled more than 300 boxes. With 12 dozen in each box, there are about 40,000 mirrors. Chinese people love to wear leather shoes, and the number of leather shoes for women is not small. Each ship has as many as 60 boxes, and there are 400 boxes with 200 pairs in each box. Since Shenqiu, the demand for general consumer goods has been very strong. This is also a good phenomenon of the economic surplus of Chinese middle-class families. The purchasing power of Chinese women is increasing, so the street atmosphere has recently become lively.</p>
<p>In the past, the criticisms we have seen and heard against new women have mostly been; "Eight words: "Insufficient production, excessive consumption" These certainly erase everything harshly and discriminate against the female nature, but this harshness and this discrimination have their own reasons for harshness and discrimination!</p>
<p>The reason for this harshness and discrimination is that women in the upper classes and women in the middle classes only know how to be extravagant and frivolous in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and spend as much as possible to show that they are aristocratic women.</p>
<p>This is the case for ordinary women without knowledge, and even for women who have the opportunity to study at universities!</p>
<p>We can see the criticism of female students in the "Summary of the Inspection Report of Six Universities in Shanghai" recently released by the Ministry of Education:</p>
<p>Jinan: "However, the students' clothing is not simple, especially for female students."</p>
<p>Shanghai: "Students are accustomed to luxury, especially female students."</p>
<p>Guanghua: "Students are mostly extravagant and westernized, especially female students' decoration."</p>
<p>Daxia: "However, students' fashion is mostly extravagant, and female students are even more frivolous."</p>
<p>The facts are the most eloquent. With the above ironclad evidence, we don't need to say anything more. Saying more is superfluous, I think.</p>
<p>At the same time, what about the women in the lower classes? They also know how to be beautiful, and they also want to be beautiful. They have no way to obtain noble materials, but they also hate and discard simple earth cloth, etc. At the same time, the dumping policies of various countries all take China as a market, and Japanese fabrics, etc., are surprisingly cheap. Three or four cents can buy a zhang of very beautiful fabric.</p>
<p>These are of course the "facts" of the past, undeniable, and there is no need to deny the "facts".</p>
<p>Starting today, it is the "Women's" "National Products Year."</p>
<p>"Women's National Products Year" is of course the most powerful expression of women's awakening. And in "Women's National Products Year," our new women will use facts to answer all those who discriminate against new women!</p>
<p>We hope that this "Women's National Products Year" will not only let people know their strength in promoting national products and loving national products, but also achieve something in other aspects with their brains and their vitality, so that everyone who discriminates will admit their mistakes in discrimination! Especially to automatically correct these past mistakes!</p>
<p>Women's Contribution</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Women's National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Nie Huiji Fen</p>
<p>For more than ten years, we've been chanting slogans of resistance and promoting domestic goods every year, but imports of foreign goods have been increasing year by year, which is quite comical. In the past two years, the Japanese bandits have been pressing harder, and resistance has naturally been more vigorous, but the import of Japanese goods has increased sharply, and the trade deficit has reached a staggering 900 million, which is a huge and alarming figure. At the same time, domestic industrial and commercial enterprises are on the verge of collapse, which is even more sad.</p>
<p>If we do not deeply think about this contradictory situation and understand its causes, then why should we join this comical play and provide outsiders with a chance to laugh at us?</p>
<p>I believe that promoting domestic goods is not only about promoting domestic goods, but also about correcting people's improper concepts. Concepts are the root of desires. We must take seeking the interests of the people as our due obligation, so that we can sacrifice our personal desires for beauty and luxury. Only then can domestic goods develop without promotion. If today's society admires European and American customs, pursues material enjoyment, advocates fashion and beauty, and only cares about convenience and comfort, then it will definitely not be able to take into account the interests of the country and the people. The root of the contradictory phenomenon today lies here, and there is no other reason.</p>
<p>Promoting domestic goods should not be based on resisting enemy goods, but for the sake of national and personal survival. It must be like this. People with shallow knowledge do not understand this meaning, thinking that my purchase of a small amount of foreign goods will not affect the country, especially my personal survival? They do not know that when the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, war and chaos are inevitable. At that time, there is no need to kill or set fires. Simply due to lack of food and inability to live, the old, the young, the weak, and the sick will naturally be poor, frozen, and starved to death.</p>
<p>Today, there are hundreds of thousands of unemployed people in various parts of our country, and millions or even tens of millions of unemployed people in European and American countries. This is all due to the decline of industry and commerce, which is caused by the declining purchasing power of the world. In short, the world's finances have dried up to the extreme today. Those with shallow knowledge see the superficial prosperity of the commercial market and think that they still have surplus wealth or have the knowledge and skills to support themselves, thinking that this problem will not affect them for the time being. Little do they know that in the past two years, more than 2,000 banks have closed down in the United States, and countless people have gone from rich to poor. People who used to be engineers and earn huge salaries suddenly have to line up at soup kitchens for food. Unemployed people and children often scavenge for food next to garbage bins (Americans are used to wasting food, so they discard things that are still edible). How can this be expected by ordinary people?</p>
<p>The strength of Japan is due to the people's ability to love their country. This is well known. Loving the country is not in slogans and written posters, but in the fact that a few people in higher positions have clear and correct concepts and the practice of hard work, serving as the leaders of the masses. The Japanese can cherish and promote their historically inherited culture and customs, and do not follow the changes of Westerners. For example, sitting on the floor and setting up temporary stalls every night are extremely inconvenient. Wooden clogs, backpacks, and high buns are all inconvenient things, but they can all be preserved. Even wealthy families do not change them. It must be known that Eastern culture mostly takes diligence and frugality as morality, and the merits and demerits of local customs are also judged from this point. What Japan preserves is the good culture of the East. Preserving it encourages diligence and frugality. If it is discarded and imitated by the West, it will tend towards luxury and laziness. Western things are convenient, but those who are used to them will gradually lose their personal abilities. Today, European and American industrial and commercial enterprises have all failed in competition with Japan. There is no other reason than the fact that the efficiency of individuals differs greatly. The development of this high efficiency is due to the ability to preserve the practice of sitting on the floor. Moreover, if Japan admires Western customs, iron beds and wooden furniture would have long exhausted Japan's economic power. Even if they were mostly self-made, they would greatly reduce their export power. How could they obtain foreign money for this amazing construction? Today, their country has achieved this success because of the clear vision and hard work of a few great men who were responsible for social guidance 50 years ago.</p>
<h3>The Cosmetic Disturbance</h3>
<p>— Qiaoming</p>
<p>The sunlight is weak and powerless, the branches and leaves of the trees turn yellow, the wind is a bit chilly, and autumn is deep!</p>
<p>On this day, a small disturbance suddenly occurred in Mr. Chen's house. The reason was that Mr. Chen bought a bottle of skin care product and handed it to his wife with great satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Did you buy it? How much does a bottle cost?" the wise Mrs. Chen asked.</p>
<p>"One dollar and twenty cents a bottle," Mr. Chen replied.</p>
<p>"A small bottle of something costs one dollar and twenty cents? Too expensive! Too expensive!"</p>
<p>"It's an old foreign brand with excellent quality."</p>
<p>"Are you a worshiper of foreign goods?" Mrs. Chen immediately frowned. She said sternly, "In this era, everyone knows to promote domestic goods, but you want to be a salesman for foreign goods. You know foreign goods are good, but do you know that domestic goods have made rapid progress in recent years? Moreover, applying foreign goods to your face, even if it's beautiful, should be considered ugly. You can abandon the root and pursue the branch, but I can't make a fool of myself!..."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen was speechless by Mrs. Chen.</p>
<p>A few days later, Mr. Chen went to the Wuzhou Pharmacy and bought a large jar of beauty cream in one-pound packaging.</p>
<p>"Look! This is domestic, and it only cost seventy-five cents, which can be used by our whole family for the entire winter," Mrs. Chen said proudly.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen did not speak. He had clearly lost this disturbance!</p>
<h3>The Grandeur of Domestic Wire Mesh</h3>
<p>The picture on the right shows the magnificent appearance of the mesh fence surrounding the airfield. This kind of mesh fence used to be foreign goods, but in the past two years, the Shanghai Gongqin Iron Factory has produced them, and Chinese people no longer need to seek them from abroad. The picture on the left shows the mesh fence surrounding the airport station. The fence gate has steel pipes as its skeleton and is secured with a specially made lock, making it extremely strong. There is also an electrical current device. In case of emergency, turning on the switch will electrify the entire mesh, and the enemy cannot cross the battery step.</p>
<h3>New Product of Domestic Freckle Lotion</h3>
<p>— Xu Luqian</p>
<p>Chinese women all use lead-based powder to apply to their faces when applying makeup, but they don't know that lead is poisonous. Over time, freckles appear on the powder application areas. There are particularly many women affected, which is a major flaw in beauty.</p>
<p>There are many imported freckle removal lotions and creams on the market, and they are very expensive. Although domestic products are available, they are not very effective, so Chinese people do not trust them. As a result, the sales of imported products in China every year are also very considerable.</p>
<p>Ms. Chen Xizhi, a physician, studied in Germany for many years and obtained a doctorate in medicine. After returning to China, she not only set up her own clinic, but also registered at the Nanyang Pharmacy and the French Pharmacy. Recently, she founded the Jianmei Pharmaceutical Industry at 217 Route Saipoise, French Concession, specializing in the production of several kinds of beauty medicines, such as miraculous freckle removal cream and freckle root removal lotion, which are the best of domestic beauty lotions. I have tried it and the effect is extremely good, and I am happy to introduce it.</p>
<p>Family Visit Record</p>
<h3>Madam Nie</h3>
<p>— Tianran</p>
<p>Madam Nie, named Jifen, is the youngest daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Gong of Xiangxiang. Since she was a child, she loved the teachings of Wenzheng Gong and was influenced by a good education. Therefore, she can write and is literate, possessing the style of Wenji Daoyun, and she is simple and frugal, with ancient morals shining on people, which is beyond the reach of modern women. Her son, Mr. Nie Yuntai, wears coarse cloth and eats vegetables, advocating the "Great Ji" doctrine, instructing young people to earn their own living. Everyone imitates Gandhi, spinning and weaving their own cloth to save the country with cloth. This is the education of the Madam. Her fourth son, Mr. Sheng, manages the Hengfeng Yarn Factory, striving to manufacture domestic yarn and cloth to compete with Japanese yarn. This is also the education of the Madam. We believe in the Madam's morality and knowledge, and especially admire the Madam's family. The Madam's management of her family can be described with the eight words "simple and straightforward, refined and courteous." All the clothes, food, and utensils in the family are all domestic products. Even a cup, a needle, and a box of matches are all domestic products. Entering her door, everything is neat and orderly, without luxury. Her sons, daughters, daughters-in-law, grandsons, and granddaughters all serve the Madam with great respect. The Madam also treats them with courtesy. Even the servants and maids are treated with politeness, without harsh words or angry expressions. At the high age of eighty-two, she looks like she is in her sixties. Her cultivation is evident here. The Madam advocates promoting domestic goods, saying that it is not in slogans and posters, but in the fact that people in leadership positions have clear and correct concepts and the practice of hard work. She greatly admires the Japanese for not easily being swayed by Western customs. Japanese women still keep their high buns, wooden clogs, backpacks, and sitting on the floor, seemingly stubborn, but the money does not flow out, and foreign goods cannot be imported, which is the foundation of Japan's wealth and strength. Chinese people are the opposite. With the productivity of the 19th century, they want to enjoy the material civilization of the 20th century, which is why they have trade deficits year after year and are so poor. The Madam said at this point, unable to hold back her tears, sighing again and again. In the end, she said that today's promotion of domestic goods is not only about promoting domestic goods, but also about correcting people's improper concepts. If everyone can sacrifice their personal desires for beauty, domestic goods will develop without promotion. If everyone worships European and American customs, tends towards modernity, and only talks about comfort and convenience, the country and the people will suffer together, and the harm will be immeasurable. Her kind and gentle words and refined and elegant demeanor command respect. It is said that there are never disputes or idle talk in the Nie family, and everything is harmonious and joyful. Madam Nie often gathers her children, grandchildren, and relatives to talk about the virtues of the ancestors and all kinds of good words and instructions, as well as the instruction to use domestic goods. Mr. Yuntai and others all take notes or publish them in the Nie family precepts. Mr. Yuntai and his wife and children all dress and behave in a very simple and generous manner, not advocating luxury, and strongly resisting extravagance. They treat people with humility and courtesy, so people can recognize them at a glance when they go out. This is all due to the Madam's profound teaching. The Madam is especially able to be consistent in her work and never tires. On New Year's Day, at the Women's Friendship Conference, the Madam served as the chairman, leading her family to the meeting, and left after the end of the meeting without showing any fatigue. It is even more rare for an elderly person to have this kind of sitting ability.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Report on Vocational Education by the Ministry of Education's Commissioners to Europe for Educational Inspection (6)</h3>
<p>㈡ Mechanic School This school is divided into several departments, such as sand casting, machine repair, and auto parts manufacturing. Students admitted must be graduates of the seventh grade of elementary school, graduate in three years, study and work part-time. There are five full-time teachers and sixteen factory craftsmen. The products of the factory vary in type, with auto parts being the most important work. The government provides an annual subsidy of 51,000 Polish currency. The factory's output has an annual profit of about 100,000. The annual expenditure is about 120,000 to 130,000 currency. Students' practice emphasizes the accuracy of work, so material consumption is extremely low.</p>
<p>Basic practical courses include woodworking models, forging, sand casting, electric pole quenching, and steel tool manufacturing. Sand casting is particularly emphasized, with practical classes in this course for three years.</p>
<p>Hu Weixi (Wowicz)</p>
<p>Agricultural Vocational School This school is located in the countryside and can have close relationships with students' families. Its purpose is to recruit children of farmers to enroll. After graduation, they still return to the countryside to serve. Students are admitted from the age of seventeen. There are currently thirty students. In addition to agricultural courses, the school also teaches chicken farming, cattle farming, sheep farming, and pig raising. Every week, students must calculate feed and weigh to examine the relationship between feed and weight. Teachers visit students' families from time to time to inspect the achievements of graduates. Students' parents also form a committee to cooperate with each other.</p>
<p>Second, Vocational Education in Germany</p>
<p>Among the countries in the world that enjoy a high reputation for industrial manufacturing, Germany should be the first. The world generally believes that this is due to the great contribution of vocational education in Germany. Now, its current situation is briefly described separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Classification of Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Supplementary Schools In Germany, it is customary that anyone who wants to learn a profession or acquire a skill must be apprenticed to a master. This has been the case for centuries. This system is called the apprenticeship system. Between the master and the apprentice, an unwritten contract is formed for a period of several years. During this period, the apprentice's treatment is the same as that of family members. With the development of modern industrial manufacturing, the apprenticeship system, although somewhat limited in handicrafts, has more strictly regulated the ranks and training. All handicraft apprentices must take a craftsman examination (Gesellenprufung) upon completion of the prescribed apprenticeship period. Those who pass the exam are called craftsmen. After several years of craftsman service and reaching the age of 25 or older, they can apply for the master craftsman examination (Meisrprufung). Anyone who has passed the master craftsman examination is allowed to recruit apprentices in the factory. This apprenticeship method also exists in commerce, but it is more free and not stipulated by law. Large manufacturing plants also often follow this custom, ordering skilled craftsmen to train apprentices.</p>
<p>The German Constitution stipulates that all young men and women who have received eight years of national school education, whether they are apprentices in factories or have taken appropriate jobs, must receive supplementary education if they are 14 years of age or older but have not yet reached 18 years of age. The schools stipulated in this constitution are called supplementary schools (Fortbildungsscbule). Although the whole country has not been able to fully implement it, all cities and towns have established these schools. However, there are not a small number of supplementary schools established in rural areas. The organization of supplementary schools nationwide is not uniform. The curriculum is generally three years, but the number of hours taught is small, so the subjects are kept simple. In addition to vocational subjects, there are civics, mathematics, bookkeeping, German, physical education, hygiene, and vocational application of drafting. Great attention is also paid to commonly used letters and documents. For girls' classes, there are sewing, cooking, and housework courses. However, the subjects and teaching materials sometimes vary according to local needs. For example, in large cities where industry and commerce are developed, there are many people taking supplementary lessons, and a class can be set up for each subject and taught separately, such as metal workers, locksmiths, carpenters, and tailors, each with a class. In remote areas, there are not many supplementary students, so classes are divided according to the major categories of each industry, such as all metal industries combined into one class, and all woodworking industries combined into one class. In extremely small areas, where the number of people is too small, the supplementary personnel of each industry are combined and taught together.</p>
<p>In rural areas, there are also similar school facilities for young people engaged in agriculture, such as farmers' children and laborers. The nature of these schools is slightly different from other supplementary schools. The teaching period is entirely in the winter, and they are called agricultural supplementary schools (LandlicheFcrtbildnngsscbule). The purpose of agricultural supplementary schools is to maintain the knowledge of culture and work and life that young people from farming families have gained in elementary school, and to cultivate their fundamental knowledge and skills in agricultural arts. The obligation for students to enter supplementary schools is also stipulated in the laws and regulations of local governments, and there are also those stipulated by local cities and villages. All young employees should have four to eight hours of school time per week. Employers have an obligation to allow employees to attend school during working hours.</p>
<p>Vocational schools and supplementary schools are only for supplementing the knowledge of employed employees and are not designed to train specialized skills. Therefore, for the purpose of training skilled craftsmen and engineering personnel, industrial and commercial industries have established vocational schools (Facbschule). Enrollment in vocational schools is free and not compulsory. They are full-day schools and not part-time schools. Only a few schools have half-day courses, and students can take other practical work in their spare time.</p>
<p>Vocational schools must cultivate talents to meet the needs of students with different levels of education. Therefore, the level of schools must be divided into shallow and deep to meet this requirement. The first type of school is where students practice art before entering employment. These schools are called preparatory vocational schools (Vorbere</p>
<p>tendeFachschulen). The second type of school requires students to have practical work experience before entering. These schools are called continuing vocational schools (WeiterfurendcFacbschulen). The entrance qualification for preparatory schools is eight years of elementary school graduation, while the entrance qualification for continuing schools is completion of the first two years of senior high school (Obersieknunda).</p>
<p>There are many types and numbers of vocational schools in Germany. Some are established for local needs, and some are close to the nature of local industries. However, most schools are directly related to the national industrial, commercial, and agricultural industries.</p>
<p>㈠ Preparatory Vocational Schools (i.e., Junior Schools) Junior schools can be divided into the following four categories:</p>
<p>(A) Commercial Schools and Secondary Commercial Schools The entrance qualification for commercial schools is limited to elementary school graduation, while the entrance qualification for secondary commercial schools is limited to junior high school graduation. The purpose is to cultivate young people's ability to engage in commerce in the future. The main courses are commercial law, commercial correspondence, accounting, bookkeeping, etc. Secondary commercial schools add foreign languages. The curriculum organization varies slightly from school to school. Some are one-year, some are one and a half years, and some are two years. When students graduate and serve, they can be exempted from part of their apprenticeship period.</p>
<p>(B) Industrial Schools of Mechanics and Metallurgy Industrial schools are extremely specialized in mechanical training. Therefore, school training can replace all apprenticeship training. The subjects are mechanical drawing and common sense of technology, and most of the time is spent on factory work.</p>
<p>(C) Women's Vocational Schools This type of school focuses on household work and garment sewing. Students are free to choose whether it is for future household life or for future self-employment. Every big city (town) must have this type of women's school, either municipal or state-owned, or schools established by public groups and societies, such as Lett|Haus and Peslulozzi|Frobel|Haus in Berlin.</p>
<p>(b) Agricultural Schools These are set up for the children of small farmers and middle-class farmers, providing them with the knowledge and skills needed in agricultural affairs to assist in rural development.</p>
<p>㈡ Continuing Vocational Schools (i.e., Intermediate Schools) This type of school is broadly divided into the following types. The levels are not uniform.</p>
<p>(a) Architectural Schools Now also known as National Secondary Industrial Architectural Schools, their purpose is to train those in earthwork, carpentry, and stonework to have the ability to pass the craftsman examination and practice independently, and to train assistants for private construction companies and engineering offices, as well as intermediate engineers for local engineering bureaus. The subjects are generally divided into two parts: 1. House construction department, 2. Roads, railways, bridges, and water conservancy projects. There are also land surveying courses. The curriculum is divided into five grades, with a study period of six months for each grade. The minimum age for entering students is 16 years old, having graduated from elementary school and having 12 months of continuous practical experience. However, the regulations of each state vary slightly. The main subjects are house construction, architectural drawing, as well as mathematics, physics, natural sciences, building materials science, commerce, civics, and physical education.</p>
<p>(b) Mechanical Engineering Schools Also known as National Machine Schools, their purpose is to train engineering personnel in mechanical manufacturing and design and management. Their scope of work emphasizes knowledge of higher industry. The entrance qualification for one part is having completed the first two years of high school, or having passed the entrance examination separately, and having two years of practical experience. The curriculum is five semesters long, with a graduation examination. The other part is having graduated from eight years of elementary school, having attended a vocational supplementary school, and having four years of practical experience. The curriculum includes four semesters, with a similar graduation examination. Within mechanical engineering schools, there are also attached precision machinery, electrical engineering, instrument manufacturing, electrical technology, machine installation, and metalworking.</p>
<p>(c) Textile Industrial Schools The organization of this school is similar to that of mechanical engineering schools. It is divided into two groups. The subjects of secondary textile schools train business managers, factory managers, textile engineers, mechanical engineering personnel, personnel who design textile machines, and personnel who apply chemistry to textiles in the textile manufacturing industry. The preparatory textile schools train office workers and technicians for companies or factories, as well as pattern workers. This type of school has the most complete equipment and is extremely sufficient in practical training. There is no limit to the qualifications for admission, as long as one has received a good general education and considerable practical experience.</p>
<p>(d) Craft Schools This type of school includes fine arts and crafts. It trains auxiliary personnel in art (personnel in painting, design, and art venues), independent art professionals, and theoretical and practical tutoring for craftsmen, journeymen, and apprentices. The subjects in the school are classified extremely complexly. Some specialize in one subject, while others combine several subjects. Some also have very complex subjects, all based on local needs. The school must have factory equipment. The duration of the curriculum is not uniform. In addition to day school, there are also evening classes and Sunday classes. There are no strict regulations for entering the school, but students must have sufficient talent and good practical experience.</p>

<h3>Peking University Owes More Than One Million in Educational Expenses</h3>
<p>Intends to Issue School Bonds to Repay Gradually</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) Chiang Menglin, President of Peking University, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 9th. He met with Wang Shijie and said that since the national crisis, due to the shortage of the national treasury, the regular expenses of Peking University have not been fully allocated, and the salaries of teachers and staff and other expenses have been in arrears for more than one million yuan, which has not yet been repaid. It is now planned to issue a kind of school bond to repay gradually. Since July last year, the central government has had no arrears in educational expenses, allocating 75,000 yuan per month. The educational expenses for Peiping and Tianjin are 360,000 yuan per month. After the central government unified taxation, the Ministry of Finance issued them on time without any arrears. The purpose of my trip to Nanjing this time is to report to Minister Wang, and then to visit President Wang before returning to Shanghai and then returning to the north.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Ministry of Education's Committee on Public Education Today</h3>
<p>Emphasizing the Promotion of Public Schools</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) The Ministry of Education has scheduled to hold the first meeting of the Committee on Public Education at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th. There are 19 members. The nine proposals submitted by the Ministry will be discussed first. According to Zhang Jiong, Director of the Department of Social Education, this meeting will focus on the promotion of public schools.

<p>Professors Donate 500 Yuan in Salary to Aid Affected Students</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) After Li Zheng, the president of National Peiping Normal University, resigned, he still went to the school to take responsibility because the Ministry of Education had not yet approved it. Today (9th), at 8 a.m., representatives of the affected students visited the president, requesting relief. Professors Yang Likui and others held a meeting last night to stipulate the method for professors to donate their salaries to help the affected students. The Ministry of Education is very concerned about the fire at the Normal University. The Normal University sent a report to the Ministry of Education the day before yesterday, detailing the location, cause of the fire, the extent of the damage, and the measures taken for aftermath, along with a list of donations and a diagram of the school building. Today (9th), the school received an express mail telegram from the Ministry of Education, inquiring about the detailed circumstances of the fire. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Telegram to Li Zheng, Principal of Peiping Normal University: Your winter telegram has been received. The destruction of school buildings and student's books and belongings is deeply felt. Please investigate and report the cause of the fire and how the aftermath is being handled. Seal of the Ministry of Education. (Reporter's Note) The Ministry of Education's express mail telegram from the 6th arrived in Peiping at 8 a.m. on the 9th. The Normal University had already prepared a report on the cause of the fire and the aftermath measures, which was sent to Beijing by express mail on the 8th. It is expected that Principal Li Zheng's resignation report will arrive in Beijing on the 10th, so there has been no reply received in Peiping at this moment. It is expected that the Ministry of Education's reply will arrive in Peiping around the 14th.</p>
<p>Li Zheng Speaks to Reporter: This reporter made a special visit to Li Zheng, the principal of Normal University. According to his talk, I am resigning for two reasons: 1. In this fire, the students' notes and translations cannot be compensated, and the loss of books is also considerable. I feel deeply uneasy because I did not take sufficient precautions beforehand, so I resign to take responsibility. 2. I have been at Normal University for over a year and am ashamed that I have not achieved any results. At this moment, it is also the end of the semester, which is a break in administrative affairs. I can retire and rest, allowing others to take my place. Until the Ministry of Education approves my resignation, I will still come to the school to take responsibility. The students who have been affected by the disaster have a very good attitude and do not make excessive demands. Most of the students at Normal University are from poor families, and it is appropriate for them to ask for relief after the disaster. I express my deep sympathy. Relief funds have now been distributed, and the affected students have received the funds. As for those affected students who are entitled to receive ten yuan, after submitting a loss statement and being reviewed by the department head, a supplementary payment can be considered, only the timing will be slightly different. The Taikoo Insurance Company has sent specialists Leiber and Han Wenbin to the school to inspect, and after opening the list for review, the compensation can be paid according to the regulations, it is said.</p>

The professors, out of their love for the students' studies, should donate funds to help the students. Please discuss this. Next, the professors spoke one after another and all agreed to donate their salaries to help the students. Finally, it was decided that the total amount of professors' salary donations would be 500 yuan, to be used specifically for the purchase of books for the affected students.</p>

<h3>Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin Interport Football Lineups</h3>
<p>Tianjin and Hong Kong's Selections Largely Determined</p>
<p>Shanghai's to Be Revealed After Two Trial Matches</p>
<p>In previous years, the interport football matches were only between Shanghai and Hong Kong or Shanghai and Tianjin. Only once before have Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin competed together in one place, due to Shanghai being the central point between the North and South, so it was held in Shanghai. As a result, Tianjin won the championship. This season will be the second triangular contest, with the location still in Shanghai, scheduled for the Lunar New Year. Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin are all actively preparing, selecting elites, and preparing to win the championship. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin: Tianjin has held two preliminary trial matches. One was during the New Year, divided into the Guolian and Junlian teams. Only Sun Sijing was selected among the Chinese players. As a result, Guoji won 6-2. The second was held last Sunday, divided into the Red and White teams. As a result, the White team won 7-4. Roxburg was unable to play that day due to illness. Deller, Jiang Lu, and others performed very well. Initially, in the first half, the White team won 6-1. In the second half, the two sides made slight changes to their lineups. Jie Hansen, Jones, and Aiqu'er defected to the Deng team, and Deng's team won 3-1. In total, the White team won 7-4. The Tianjin representative lineup has been largely determined as follows:</p>
<p>He Ou Jiang Lu</p>
<p>Da Silva Jie Hansen</p>
<p>Motuo Sun Sijing Budufu</p>
<p>Deller Jones</p>
<p>Roxburg Aiqu'er</p>
<p>Reserves: Huaifen, Mi Xia Rui Ke Ren</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Hong Kong held a trial match on the 3rd of this month, divided into the Blue and White teams, with the White team being the ideal lineup. The performance was not beautiful. The Chinese players participating were Huang Jiliang, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Yang Shuiyi, Tan Jiangbai, and He Jiaqiang, etc. As a result, the White team won 2-1. After the match, the Football Association carefully considered and selected 14 players as official representatives. The Chinese players selected were Huang Jiliang, Liang Rongzhao, Tan Jiangbai, and Zheng Jiliang (all from the South China team), and it was decided that the captain would be Kirk. Although the Dagaoshanu brothers did not attend the trial match, they were still selected as official team members based on their past performance. They are scheduled to depart for Shanghai around February 9th. The lineup is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Kirk</p>
<p>Robert Ju Da Gaoshanu</p>
<p>Morrison Lietlili</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang Bilu Quilao Hou Hual</p>
<p>Shitulanqi Tan Jiangbai</p>
<p>Liang Rongzhao Zheng Jiliang</p>
<p>Xiao Gaoshanu</p>
<p>Shanghai: Shanghai has many talents, and the hope of victory is stronger. After returning victorious from Hong Kong last year, they were invited by the Tianjin Xilian Association to go north to compete. In terms of the selection of personnel, they filled the ranks with inferior players, resulting in a disastrous defeat of 7-1, which was an unprecedented disgrace in the history of the Shanghai Interport team and was greatly slandered by people in the North. This season, the triangular competition is being held in Shanghai. Hong Kong and Tianjin are carefully selecting personnel to come to Shanghai to challenge, so the Shanghai team should be extra careful in selecting personnel. The performance of the trial match on New Year's Day was still good, but many players did not appear on the field, which is not enough to see the real situation. The second trial match should give a slight indication.</p>
<h3>Assaulting Referee Case Transferred to Special District Court for Prosecution</h3>

<h3>Western Youth Women's Basketball League: Liangjiang Team Achieves Six Wins in Six Matches</h3>
<p>Decisive Victory Over Southeastern Team B Last Night</p>
<p>Southeastern Team A Loses to Green Team</p>
<p>The Western Youth Basketball League men's games have few spectators, and last night's women's games were also sparse and desolate. The main component attracting the audience is too lacking. The result of last night's game was that Liangjiang defeated Southeastern Team B by a score of 52 to 17, achieving six wins in six matches. Southeastern Team A lost to the Green Team by a score of 39 to 18. The other three groups were all Western women, and Chinese were not involved. The American Women's team defeated the McLain team by a score of 32 to 10, maintaining their undefeated record, which is noteworthy. The results of last night's five games are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Liangjiang Defeats Southeastern Team B 52 to 17</p>
<p>(2) Green Team Defeats Southeastern Team A 39 to 18</p>
<p>(3) American Women Defeats McLain 32 to 10</p>
<p>(4) Red Team Defeats Telephone 34 to 20</p>
<p>(5) Yellow Team Defeats Elementary 12 to 9</p>
<h3>Bingjiang Defeats Southeastern Team B</h3>
<p>Southeastern Team B ultimately could not match Liangjiang due to insufficient experience and technique. After a slight struggle in the first quarter, the rest of the game was dominated by Liangjiang. First, Yang Sen scored to break the deadlock, and then Chen Zaichun scored twice in a row, surpassing them 4 to 2. Yang Linzao equalized the score each time. Chen Zaichun and Xue Jinghua each made one free throw, and Southeastern Team B led again 7 to 4. This was the golden age of Southeastern Team B, and from then on, they gradually declined. Liangjiang pushed forward step by step, and the rest of the match went smoothly. In the first quarter, Liangjiang reversed the score and won 10 to 7. In the first half, the score became 27 to 13. In the second half, the situation remained the same. As a result, Liangjiang won 52 to 17.</p>

<h3>Southeastern Team A Suffers a Crushing Defeat</h3>
<p>In the next match, Southeastern Team A suffered a crushing defeat to the Green Team by a score of 39 to 18. It was expected that Southeastern would lose to the Green Team beforehand, but it was not expected that the score difference would be so great. The Green Team was tall and strong, and Southeastern was incomparable in comparison. The forwards had an even greater impact, and there was nothing they could do. Although Ren Shu was very lively, she was at a loss. Moreover, the Green Team's skills have improved very quickly recently, their movements are gradually becoming more agile, and their shooting is also accurate. Therefore, Southeastern surrendered. The Green Team first scored one point on a free throw to open the scoring, and Liao ZhuYuan also returned one point. The Green Team then scored six consecutive points, making it 7 to 1. The first quarter ended 8 to 3, and the first half ended 17 to 8. The final result was 39 to 18.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Children's Year</h3>
<p>— Chen Tuigan</p>
<p>I remember that in October of last year, the China Child Welfare Association submitted a request to the government to designate this year as Children's Year. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Committee formulated all the measures for Children's Year and submitted them to the government for record. Every year on April 4th, our country has followed the example of European and American countries and designated it as Children's Day. Now there is Children's Year again, which is quite novel and interesting. However, I cannot help but have some thoughts.</p>
<p>Our country's society has always been inattentive to children. The general mentality is that children understand nothing, so they cannot be treated the same as adults. Families with children often have difficulty renting a house (my family has lived in Shanghai for four years and moved three times. Each time I looked at a house, the landlord would always ask how many children I had in my family, believing that families with three or five children would definitely be noisy and annoying). The sound of women in the alley scolding children is even deafening. The wives of laborers, after giving birth to children, even abandon them in trash cans. Pure children, where is your happiness? How can it not be heartbreaking?</p>
<p>On the other hand, how much do European and American countries care for children? Almost all public facilities in society have a place for children; children's parks and early childhood education centers in cities are even more visible everywhere. And scholars generally advocate that the twentieth century is the century of children. European and American children are so happy, while Chinese children are not valued like them, which is especially heartbreaking in comparison.</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country and the new elements of national progress. If we want to revitalize the country and nation, we must take special care of children. This year, the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Association is actively preparing to set up various nurseries, and those in charge are mostly domestic education experts, who raise children on behalf of families and cultivate elements on behalf of the country. This is indeed a great charitable social education undertaking. I hope that people from all walks of life will do their best to help them. We must know that this kind of facility is not only a matter of children's personal happiness, but also a matter of the rise and fall of the entire nation. Everyone should take some responsibility.</p>
<p>Finally, I especially hope that the Children's Welfare Committee can extend this facility to all provinces and counties, so that charitable organizations across the country will rise up in response, and more Montessori will be produced. The future of the nation is deeply dependent on this.</p>
<h3>Lord Cha and Lord Sha</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>There is a saying in Suzhou: "Lord Cha flies gold leaf paper." It is a satire on the extravagance of playboy sons, who will eventually become impoverished. It is said that there is a story behind it. On the Double Ninth Festival, he climbed the Beisi Pagoda of Baoen Temple and saw people flying colored paper, which was very fun. So he bought a lot of gold leaf paper and flew it down from the pagoda. People below the pagoda suspected that it was a golden rain and scrambled to grab it, causing a sensation far and wide. Mingzhai Xiaozhi says that this was the affair of Huang Xueqian of Qingpu, and at that time there was also a taunt of "importantly poor." However, no one mentions Huang anymore, but Cha has evolved into a drama called "Cha Pan's Rivalry of Wealth." In the end, is it Huang or Cha? It is unknown.</p>
<p>Who knew that there was also a Lord Sha in Wucheng Land Changchun Xiangyinlou Bintan. That Lord Sha was so extravagant that he could not hire a boat on the Dragon Boat Festival to watch the boat race in Tiger Hill. The following year, a month in advance, he ordered his servants to hire all the boat owners inside and outside the city, and did not allow them to hire to others. On the Dragon Boat Festival, people could not hire a boat, so they all discussed with Lord Sha to transfer the hire. Lord Sha generously agreed, designated a location, and dispatched them separately. The boats were lined with ready-made wine and dishes, and there were also beautiful courtesans to serve wine, without the need for tourists to spend a penny. From then on, Lord Sha's name was known to women and children. Later, he became so poor that he made a living selling snacks, and he liked to sing folk songs and ditties. Children would buy three big coins worth of oil cakes and also ask him to sing a piece like "Cutting Flowers Sha Night Tour." But people still called him Lord Sha. Although he did not have the matter of flying gold leaf paper, his behavior was similar to that of Lord Cha. Perhaps Lord Cha and Lord Sha are one and the same, because Cha and Sha rhyme and are easily confused. Otherwise, they are both Lords, "what a coincidence!" Moreover, there is nothing else seen about Lord Sha's words. The Bintan record did not note the era, and it was probably derived from hearsay, and there may be a possibility of mistaken Cha for Sha.</p>
<p>The current Suzhou definitely does not have such extravagant acts as Lord Cha. Even if there are a few playboy sons, they only seek their own enjoyment, and who is willing to benefit others. In this cold winter, they are at home surrounded by the stove, listening to wireless broadcasts, smoking cigars, and drinking brandy. Even the beggars at the door asking for a copper plate are waved away by the doorman. Then Lord Cha can be considered a unique creation, rare and valuable, even if he is defeated (a prodigal son), he is still glorious.</p>
<h3>Cold Wind</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Cold wind saddens the evening,</p>
<p>Gusts disturb carriage dust.</p>
<p>A guest's time is cheap,</p>
<p>Returning home brings genuine laughter.</p>
<p>Wars are not yet over,</p>
<p>Disasters must have a cause.</p>
<p>Who can foresee the coming days?</p>
<p>It's hard to be a peasant.</p>
<h3>Winter Solstice</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The mirage of the city rises with festive joy,</p>
<p>But alone before the lamp, my shadow grieves.</p>
<p>The cold begins, I dislike the wine's thinness,</p>
<p>The night cannot offset my lengthening sorrow.</p>
<p>Desolate, what kind of world is this now?</p>
<p>Endless, the sky is covered in frost.</p>
<p>No need to play the six pipes,</p>
<p>I myself lament the setting sun.</p>
<h3>Experiment Report on "Kissing Endurance"</h3>
<p>— Ya Men</p>
<p>This journal previously published a strange story of the "New York Kissing Endurance Competition," which caused a sensation among our colleagues and was spread around. Some of my colleagues are over forty years old, and their wives are yellow-faced women who do not understand what kissing is; some are just over twenty and have not yet encountered Miss, naturally not. They would not believe the endurance results of Ms. Du Liusi and her lover. However, there are also some people who are half-believing. Therefore, those who do not believe at all and those who are half-believing argued - playfully argued.</p>
<p>I have been newly married for not long, and my wife is still studying at the county women's normal school, which is considered more modern in the eyes of my colleagues. The outcome of their argument was that I had to go back and experiment. When they were arguing heatedly, I had the intention of going back to experiment. As soon as they appointed me, I accepted the order without hesitation.</p>
<p>My new wife was busy preparing for the fourth monthly exam. When I returned home at 9:00 PM, she was still working diligently. I asked her to kiss, and she reluctantly complied and then focused her eyes on the book again. I continued to ask, but she refused. I discussed with her about the things during the day. She replied to me; "I don't have that much free time." I was disappointed and gave up.</p>
<p>I graded papers, and she read books until 11:00 PM, when we both went to sleep. I don't know why, after a hard day, although tired, I couldn't sleep. The events of the day were just jumping curiously in my mind. I couldn't bear it, and without asking for consent, I hugged her tightly and kissed her. Oh, no, it separated in less than a minute. This was not because the unconsenting her pushed me away, I really couldn't bear it. I was really amazed at Ms. Du's achievement of more than three hours, so amazed that I didn't quite believe it.</p>
<p>When her and my mouths are closed together, we can't help but breathe at the same time. The carbon dioxide coming out of the four nostrils collides together and makes a sound. In that small space of the nostrils, in that short time of sixteen breaths per minute, the carbon dioxide does not have time to dissipate, and the fresh air does not have time to rush in. The second absorption is still carbon dioxide, which is very uncomfortable. If the two breathe one after the other, it would be even worse. What I absorb is exactly her carbon dioxide, and what she absorbs is exactly my carbon dioxide, which is even more uncomfortable. I am unwilling and unable to do more of the absorption of carbon dioxide, and besides, I don't want to win any championship, so I was defeated in less than a minute.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>Record of Bullfighting at Jinhua Temple (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>From the perspective of humanitarianism, bullfighting seems to be a very brutal thing, but on the other hand, it is a beautiful act of promoting civic spirit and advocating martial spirit. Probably everything in the world has its advantages and disadvantages, and we don't need to discuss it in detail; just in terms of the superficial phenomena, bullfighting is always a more exciting scene in animal games.</p>
<p>I believe that most Chinese people's understanding of bullfighting (referring to the majority) comes from books and movies, and everyone knows only Spanish bullfighting. Of course, I myself am the same. I have only seen magnificent bullfighting arenas, bulls with sharp knives tied to their horns, horses forced to be sacrificed, and agile warriors wielding spears in the notes of predecessors and in movies. In other words, most of us only think that bullfighting is a patent of European countries and is a very complex cornering skill, and there is never an opportunity to see it in the Americas or East Asia. However, unexpectedly, on the program list of the whole line opening ceremony of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, I actually found the line "Bullfighting at Jinhua Temple". What a moving program this is!</p>
<p>Attracted by this amazing program, a few of us took advantage of the convenience of our duties and actually stepped from Shanghai, which only sees smoke and coal in the sky, to the picturesque Jinhua at 2:00 PM on December 28th, the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Of course, Jinhua is a familiar place to us because of ham (actually, let me tell you in passing, the place of ham production is Dongyang, and Jinhua is just a transit station). After we got off the train, we reluctantly lingered at the venue of the whole line opening ceremony of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway for four or five minutes, deliberately crossed the railway tracks, and ran to the opposite side of the station to admire our main objective - bullfighting.</p>
<p>The bullfighting arena happened to be set up on a plain surrounded by mountains on three sides. Several thousand people were squeezing, shouting, and floating on various mountain tops. Looking from a distance of several tens of feet, it was a vivid scene of a "human wall." So a few of us walked up a high and low dirt hill, and halfway up the hill, we saw two bamboo poles carrying a white flag with black characters, with the three characters "Bullfighting Arena" written on it. Next to the flag, a gentleman wearing a coarse cloth gown gave me a program list, which was printed with copper letters. I didn't expect them to be so sophisticated!</p>
<p>The program list was printed very clearly. The first pair was two bulls, so-and-so, fighting each other, and the second pair was two bulls, so-and-so, fighting each other. There were more than a dozen pairs in total, and the names of these bulls were so special that they were somewhat incredible. The most common one is to call it something "Gua," like "Double Tooth Gua," "Hero Gua," "Black Dragon Gua," etc. I really can't figure out what this "Gua" word should be interpreted as. In addition, there are those who borrow the names of ancient people, such as "Luo Cheng" and "Wu Song." The strangest ones are "Little Casual," "Little Dirty," "New Flower Dan," "Little Flower Dan," etc. It can be said that they are picked up at will and have no consciousness at all, just a simple way to be funny and amusing.</p>
<p>Walking up the hilltop, and with much difficulty, grabbing some foothold under the shoulders of many Jinhua friends, everyone stretched their necks and looked towards the center. The center was originally a flat area, but now it has become a shallow pond that is tens of feet long and wide; around the pond, there are countless tenants dressed up, barefoot, surrounding it in groups. In the middle, there are also several people with rolled up sleeves, their bodies covered with mud, even their heads and faces, almost like a mud man; it is said that they were specially elected to be bullfighting experts as notaries or assistants, and when the two bulls were fighting together, they would go over and separate them, so that each bull would not have any excessive behavior, and so that each bull would have equal opportunities to fight.</p>
<p>So how do these bulls actually fight?</p>
<p>From the moment I departed from the Shanghai North Railway Station until I walked to the bullfighting arena, my heart was always beating non-stop, thinking that I would definitely see a tragedy of piercing chests and abdomens, and flesh and blood flying everywhere. I think most of the people who went from Shanghai or Hangzhou this time thought this way!</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-One</p>
<p>Whispering Under the Lamp, Painstakingly Teaching the Weak Offspring</p>
<p>Leaning on a Cane, Wandering Below the Mountain, Calmly Watching the Heroes</p>
<p>Old Zhao suddenly understood the reason why he was lingering outside the door. He put his jujube wood cane into his arms, clasped his fists, and bowed several times to Ji Zhi, laughing loudly in a high voice, "I wouldn't dare to say that." Ji Zhi said, "Old Master Zhao, you're in good spirits. The weather is good today, so you're out for a walk?" Old Zhao said, "I heard the red leaves on West Mountain are beautiful, so I wanted to take a look." Ji Zhi said, "Are you walking there?" Old Zhao smiled, holding the jujube wood cane in one hand, while smoothing his beard with the other. Ji Zhi laughed, "The red leaves are at the Badachu Park, not at the Biyun Temple. From here, it's about forty or fifty li round trip, right?" Old Zhao said, "My friend, don't look at my age. Walking twenty or thirty li is nothing. I plan to walk there and hire an animal to ride back. I was just worried about being lonely walking alone. Second Master, are you interested?" Ji Zhi recalled the time last year when he and Gui Zhi went to see the red leaves, and realized that it was that time of year again. Thinking about the past and present, he felt an endless sense of melancholy. Now that Gui Zhi was in a wealthy family and seemingly lost forever, it wouldn't be bad to take this opportunity to walk ten or twenty li with this old man to find out about Gui Zhi's news. Besides, he was feeling very troubled himself and could use some distraction. So he laughed, "If Old Master has such an interest, I'll accompany you." Zhao Weng was overjoyed to hear that he was willing to accompany him. He clasped his hands and bowed a few times, laughing, "While the weather is still early, let's go. It doesn't matter if we get tired. We'll stop wherever we reach." The rural people ate their meals early, and both of them had already eaten, so they didn't delay and started walking along the main road. Who knew that Zhao Weng was strong and energetic, and walked no less than Ji Zhi. He usually dragged the jujube wood cane he held in his hand. The two of them chatted idly as they walked, so they didn't feel tired. By a little after two o'clock, they arrived at the foot of West Mountain. (288)</p>

<h3>The Glory of the Future</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chenglu</p>
<p>Almost every year, foreign writers come to China, and every time they come, they cause a little trouble. First there was Bernard Shaw, then there was Tagore; only Valéry, everyone doesn't want to mention, or can't mention. Tagore didn't talk about politics, thinking he could stay out of the controversy, but he earned the title of "foreign literary riffraff" for complimenting food and sex, and our commentators debated about it here. He's probably going to write novels now.</p>
<p>It's impossible for our noses to be as high and straight as Europeans', but if we have a few coins in our pockets, we can watch movies the same way. Detective movies are boring, love movies are stale, war movies are tiresome, and comedy movies are pointless, so we have "Tarzan the Ape Man," "Beast of the Jungle," and "African Adventure," etc., bringing wild beasts and barbarians onto the stage. But even in barbarous lands, there must be a little bit of the curvy bodies of barbarian women. If we still like to watch it, then it shows that no matter how much we ridicule it, we are still a little reluctant to let go. "Sex" is very important to the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>In Western Europe, literary magazines and movies are not that different; some so-called literary figures also have to find some bizarre (Grotesque) and erotic (Erotic) things to satisfy their patrons, so there are</p>
<p>adventurous trips, the purpose of which is not to bow to the local landlords or ask for wine. However, if asked a foolish question, they dismiss it with a joke. They don't really understand these things, and they don't need to know. Tagore is just one of these people.</p>
<p>But Chinese people, in the works of these kinds of writers, will appear on the stage with various so-called "natives." Just look at the itinerary of Mr. Tagore published in the newspaper ｜ China, Southeast Asia, South America. England, Germany, etc. are too ordinary. We must be aware that we are being depicted, and we must also be aware that the glory of being depicted will increase, and we must also be aware that in the future, people will find it interesting that such things happened.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Lunacharsky</h3>
<p>— Xiu Xia</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read a news item in a Tianjin newspaper titled "The Honors of a Russian Literary Giant," which said:</p>
<p>Moscow, 1st dispatch: The remains of the great writer Lunacharsky, who died in Menton, France, on December 26, have been transported to Moscow today. Government officials and many of Lunacharsky's relatives and friends were at the station to welcome Lunacharsky's coffin. The entire city of Moscow flew flags at half-mast in mourning. Lunacharsky's coffin was carried off the train by Litvinov and others. Another 2nd dispatch: Lunacharsky's remains were buried in Red Square today. More than 100,000 people participated in the burial ceremony, including Kalinin, Molotov, Kaganovich, etc. The People's Commissar of Education, Bubnov, delivered a speech on behalf of the government. Lunacharsky's ashes were buried in the Kremlin wall.</p>
<p>So, the great modern writer Lunacharsky has been dead for almost two weeks, and our country has only just received this little bit of news｜I will briefly describe Lunacharsky's life and his contributions to scholarship, to express my condolences.</p>
<p>Lunacharsky was born in 1876</p>
<p>near Poltava. His family were large landowners, but some say he was born in Kiev in 1878. His mother was Russian, and his father was Polish. Little is known about his childhood. In his own writings, he said that at the age of seven, he threw a religious icon on the ground, expressing atheistic thoughts. But his mother was a religious believer and hoped that her son would become a pastor, which resulted in her great disappointment. After graduating from middle school, he was limited by his circumstances and went abroad to university, where he learned that many exiled scholars were gathered in Switzerland. Later, he joined the "Labor Liberation Society," which was related to Plekhanov and others. He then went to Paris to study Marxism and art theory. Finally, he returned to Russia, but was exiled to Vologda. After three exiles, he returned to his homeland during the March Revolution. After the revolution, Lunacharsky held important positions until his death, at the age of only fifty-odd years.</p>
<p>His scholarship was very profound. From natural sciences to all fields of art, he was deeply knowledgeable. He made rich contributions to philosophy, literary criticism, and drama, and especially to aesthetics, he had outstanding insights. In his short biography of Lunacharsky, Ozaki Kei says that he possessed all kinds of excellent elements: a clear mind, a strong spirit, poetic emotions, and extremely quick comprehension—all were manifestations of outstanding talent. This is very appropriate.</p>
<p>Lunacharsky has now passed away before reaching old age. He left a vast amount of works for future generations to study. Although his theories have been criticized and considered not very correct, he has been working hard to correct them in recent years. This humility in accepting criticism from others is especially admirable.</p>
<p>In any case, Lunacharsky was always a pioneer of the times. We who study literature should regard his death as a great loss to the academic world and deeply regret it.</p>
<h3>In a Girls' School</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Quite a while had passed, and no one was entering or leaving the school. In the large courtyard, only the principal and the seven of us who had no homes to go to were holding on. The courtyard, which was usually lively, was now filled with endless silence, extremely deserted. Therefore, the sound of the autumn wind sweeping the fallen leaves on the ground clearly penetrated our eardrums.</p>
<p>Our hearing, at least at this time, dominated our entire bodies. It can be said that we were constantly listening intently. As long as some kind of noisy sound came through, we would all lose color and our hearts would beat uncontrollably. We were afraid of the impending encounter｜｜Japanese soldiers were about to come from Changchun to take over the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Changchun had already been forcibly occupied by Japanese soldiers two days ago. From any point of view, there was a need and possibility for them to continue to invade Jilin. However, the military authorities of the provincial capital did not make any defensive preparations under such tense circumstances, let alone prepare for war. Since there were no troops to resist the Japanese soldiers, the provincial capital could only be forcibly occupied by the Japanese!</p>
<p>The students, teachers, and staff of the city, as well as those who lived closer to home, all returned home yesterday. The school fell into a state of anarchy, and the whole city was in great chaos. The streets were full of people, carts, horses, and belongings, moving from Dongguan to Xiguan, from Jiangbei to Jiangnan, and from the city to the countryside. After a period of chaotic moving, no one knew which area was safe.</p>
<p>The principal looked even more pitiful than us, as if the Japanese soldiers' eyes were specially used to find the principal of the girls' school. As soon as they arrived, they would grab him first. He was terrified, his face pale, pacing helplessly in the principal's office. He also had a home and could return to it, but he had a duty and could not leave an empty school and run away.</p>
<p>Our dormitory was deathly still, but our hearts were, on the contrary, unusually active and unable to calm down. I thought to myself: After the Japanese soldiers occupy the provincial capital, they will definitely occupy the outer counties as well, and there will definitely be no troops to resist in the outer counties. That's for sure, in a few days we will become slaves of a conquered nation like the Koreans. But I couldn't help but think of the troops in the city. Why didn't they take any action? The state raises soldiers to defend against foreign aggression, and the people pay taxes to demand national security. Now that the Japanese soldiers are really about to occupy the city, there is no action at all. What is going on?：：：</p>
<p>"Wei, listen!"</p>
<p>I was lost in thought when I heard someone call my name. Without bothering to identify who was calling me, I just listened quietly. Indeed, there was a faint sound, but I couldn't determine where it was coming from.</p>
<p>After a while, the sound became louder, "Woo：：："</p>
<p>On the street, there was a sudden burst of more chaotic noise, shouting, running, and even crying. The "Woo：：：" sound was suppressed.</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Have they come in?"</p>
<p>Some of us said this in panic, and everyone's minds became tense, thinking that disaster was imminent. We couldn't escape, so we waited.</p>
<p>The "Woo：：：" sound grew louder at this time, and the sound of people shouting subsided, as if the sound was spreading from the sky. We ran to the center of the courtyard and looked up at the sky. Sure enough, it was an airplane. Although we had never seen this thing before, we had recognized it in pictures long ago. Seeing the sun flag on the body of the plane, we knew it was a Japanese plane. This was probably the reason why the people on the street shouted even louder.</p>
<p>"God!" someone shouted, shouting really miserably. At this moment, the door of a classroom opened with a "Ya" sound. We turned our eyes to look. The one who opened the door was our principal. While pressing his hat tightly on his head with both hands, he quickly hid under the lectern. He was probably afraid that the Japanese in the plane would see him, right? No, he was preventing the bombs dropped from the plane. He must have thought that the hat and the desk could protect his body.</p>
<p>Thinking of bombs, we also felt our own danger. The plane flew away, but our fear deepened. We thought that after the plane came, the Japanese soldiers who took the train from Changchun might be arriving at the train station soon.</p>
<p>What should we do? We had been worried and afraid every day for three days. Today, fear had finally begun. What should we do in the future?</p>
<p>Why is our Chinese territory being forcibly occupied by Japanese soldiers? Why should our compatriots be trampled on by Japanese soldiers? Where can we seek protection for our lives?</p>
<p>Thinking is useless. Thinking about it and thinking about it, we still can't get an answer and can't save ourselves from the dangerous situation. So we just stop thinking about it. Trying to escape is not a good way either, unless (</p>
<p>escaping from the world, otherwise we can't escape this disaster.</p>
<p>This time, I relaxed my mind and wasn't afraid of anything. I even had the leisure to run to the classroom and pull the principal out from under the lectern, laughing and saying:</p>
<p>"Principal Wang, the plane left a long time ago. You really have ideas. Why didn't you teach us first?"</p>
<p>I was still joking with him at this time. In fact, we were all equally pitiful people!</p>
<h3>Amusing Metaphors</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>As soon as you mention "the end of the Ming Dynasty," many people will feel a headache, because the materials from that time, when read now, are quite heartbreaking. In fact, that's not entirely the case. Although there are many "heartbreaking" things, there are also quite a few "appetizing" articles. At the beginning of the New Year, auspiciousness is paramount, so I'm setting aside the "heartbreaking" and talking about "amusing metaphors." "Amusing metaphors" means that many things are not said directly, and many things are not handled directly, but are explained with humorous and interesting metaphors. The intellectuals at the end of the Ming Dynasty were most adept at this, and it can truly be said that they were "unprecedented and unsurpassed." This is one of the characteristics of literature at the end of the Ming Dynasty, and it was also created by the objective environment at that time. This is the preface.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Feng Qi's letter to Yang Mengshan, a senior official, says: "Now that the court is discussing restoration, the elders are in the midst of the wind and waves, while you are letting your hair down and lying on Peach Blossom Ridge. This is like shaking your clothes in the clouds, looking down on the mundane world and the dust of the wild horses, which is laughable." This metaphor is truly beautiful. "Letting your hair down" is such a celestial attitude; "lying on Peach Blossom Ridge" is such a poetic realm, except that they can't see the "dust." This way of scolding is much more "aesthetically pleasing" than the straightforward scolding of people like us. This kind of article can be considered "the art of scolding people." What do you think, Mr. Liang Shiqiu and the gentlemen of "Yifeng"?</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Yang Xunji said to others: "When I look at poetry, I don't judge it by its style or genre, but only seek to express one's feelings directly and describe the scenery realistically. If women and children can all understand what is meant, then it is considered a good poem. As for those who embellish and piece together, stubbornly picking up the spittle of the ancients, they are just puppets with false strings, and I don't take them." "Picking up the spittle of the ancients" is a very mediocre way of scolding, but when you add "embellishing and piecing together" and "puppets with false strings," it becomes an aesthetically pleasing article of scolding. This is truly an amusing metaphor. I humbly offer this to the current "puppets with false strings" of today's poets, novelists, and even magazine editors.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Li Kai told his son: "Writing in bed and reading books in bed are familiar situations; composing poems at a banquet and riding horses on the mountain are dangerous things; I tell you the places where I have gained and lost in my life." An entire philosophy of life is said clearly and cleanly in the amusing metaphor of "writing in bed" and "riding horses on the mountain," which are picked up casually.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (82)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>One morning, when he had finished washing up, the maid Josephine handed him the letter of appointment.</p>
<p>His first feeling was the same as that of a death row inmate who heard the notice of commutation; he immediately felt that his pain was alleviated by the thought of this long journey and this quiet life, constantly rocked by the flowing sea, constantly drifting, constantly escaping.</p>
<p>He now lived at home like a silent, cautious outsider. From the night he revealed the filthy secret he had discovered to his younger brother, he felt that he had severed his last relationship with his family. He often regretted that he should not have told Jian about this. He thought of himself as an ugly, vile, and sinister person, but he felt a little more comfortable because he had said it.</p>
<p>He had never met his mother or brother's eyes since then. Their eyes adopted an astonishing mobility and a trickery like enemies afraid of encountering each other, avoiding each other. He always thought: "What did she say to Jian? Did she admit it or deny it? What does my brother think? What does he think of her, what does he think of me?" He was annoyed because he couldn't guess. He hardly talked to them now, except in front of Roland, to avoid his questions.</p>
<p>When he received the letter of appointment, he showed it to his family that day. His father, who was easily made happy by everything, clapped his hands and congratulated him. Jian replied in a serious tone, but with a soul full of joy:</p>
<p>"I sincerely congratulate you, because I know that there are many competitors for this. You must have succeeded because of the letters of recommendation from your professors."</p>
<p>And his mother muttered with her head down:</p>
<p>"I'm glad you succeeded."</p>
<p>After lunch, he went to the shipping company's office to inquire about the various procedures; he found out the name of the doctor on the "Picardy" mail ship, which was sailing tomorrow, so that he could consult him about all the details of his new life and the special circumstances he would encounter in the future.</p>
<p>Dr. Pirait was on the ship at that time. He went on board and was received in a small room on the mail ship by a young man with golden yellow whiskers who resembled his brother. They talked for a long time.</p>
<p>In the resounding depths of the large ship, we heard a vague, continuous, and constant din, the sound of cargo falling into the cabin, and footsteps, voices, the movement of loading machines, the whistle of the foreman, the sound of iron chains being dragged or reeled on the wheels by the power of steam ｜ this power made the entire ship tremble slightly ｜ all mixed together.</p>
<p>But when Biel said goodbye to his colleague and walked back to the street, a new sorrow struck him and surrounded him like the mist that came from the end of the world and raced across the sea! This elusive, dense mist carried a mysterious impurity, like the infectious breath of a barbaric and miasmic land.</p>
<p>Even in his most painful moments, he had never felt like this, sinking into the gutter of suffering. This was because the final rift had been made; he was left alone. When he dug away all the sources of tenderness from his heart, he did not feel the poverty of a homeless dog that suddenly occupied him.</p>

<h3>Little Fluctuation in Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>Extremely Quiet:: Slight Setback of Three Corners</p>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday, hovering for half a day, with only a fluctuation of one yuan and seven corners. The market situation was extremely mediocre.

Although the opening price of the wool market fell slightly, it was very small, but the situation was still stable. After the opening, there was no fluctuation, hovering around ninety yuan. Although people were optimistic, because the HSBC exchange rate was listed as 125 longer for US exchange rates, banks were willing to stuff their stomachs, although it was firm and more volatile, lacking special changes.

<h3>The Public Debt Surge Created by Speculators Shorting Securities</h3>
<p>| A Day of Extreme Twists and Turns |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange initially saw a report that the government planned to issue another 100 million yuan in 23rd-year Customs Treasury Bonds, with a monthly interest rate of 0.06 yuan and repayment over ten years. Rumors in the market were rife, and confidence among various groups was relatively weak. However, market prices uniformly declined by 0.10 to 0.50 yuan. In the second session, sellers continued to flood the market, and issues 43 and 46 also saw selling. However, issue 11, buying this month's troop reduction, had a huge appetite, which helped maintain market prices, creating a mixed upward and downward situation, but only by around 0.20 to 0.30 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon session opened, remaining weak and sluggish. However, issues 15 and 26 suddenly saw large amounts of buying, holding up market prices, with fluctuations limited to 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Observing the situation in the three sessions, both morning and afternoon, it was completely chaotic and hovering. Most groups remained in a wait-and-see mode, awaiting new news.</p>
<p>By the closing bell at 5:00 PM, the Zhejiang-Fujian war situation was clearly unfavorable to short sellers, and the upward trend gradually began, becoming stronger and stronger. Many rose by 1.20 yuan. In the current environment, short sellers were compelled to cover their positions, vying to do so for fear of greater losses if they delayed. Therefore, the upward trend was still caused by short sellers.</p>
<p>As a result, prices for the aforementioned issues fluctuated somewhat due to less short covering, while various 20th-year issues uniformly rose by several jiao to one yuan, with the trend still showing signs of continued increases. The total transaction volume was estimated at around 20 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Quiet and Observant New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>Sincere Trading Company reported on the 9th that the New York stock market remained idle. However, due to the increase in cigarette prices, tobacco stocks were exceptionally strong, and the market situation also rose sharply, by as much as eight yuan. Subsequently, long sellers took profits, and speculators awaited tomorrow's speech by Roosevelt, mostly observing from the sidelines. Corporate bonds were slightly higher, and US public debt continued to weaken. The total daily transaction volume was 870,000 shares.</p>
<p>Wheat prices rose along with coarse grains. Cotton mills continued to absorb supply. According to the report, Congress is planning to increase cotton reduction. Buyers were waiting for the market to rebound. The Gold Stabilization Fund bought gold at a price of 34.06 yuan per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 97.57 Up 0.84</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 40.60 Up 0.48</p>

<h3>Sudden Reversal and Decline in Yarn and Cotton Prices After Several Days of Continuous Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market became weaker, suddenly declining in the afternoon. According to market rumors, Wing On Textile Factory had opened a low price for 20-count Golden City yarn. As a result, the yarn market, which had risen for three consecutive days, saw another speculative bubble. However, after a thorough investigation by reporters, a part of the factory reported that the factory had not opened up production. In short, the yarn market situation was not as strong as the cotton market, with the standard higher than the current yarn price, posing a great obstacle to the yarn market.</p>
<h3>Human Trademark Down 1.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>The human trademark market opened in the morning with weak buying interest. There were reports that current yarn sales had slowed slightly. Prices for each month fell by 0.30 to 0.70 yuan. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly changed, and selling pressure increased again. Prices for each month fell by 0.80 to one yuan. The statistics for the total daily turnover showed 18,100 bales. Dafeng sold 1,750 bales, Tongfu 450 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, and Chunji 1,050 bales.

However, Indian and American cotton markets continued to rise, so confidence remained strong. The Ningbo group of longs continued to hold firm, with strong intentions. However, the yarn market was weak, and the current cotton from the factory was still slow to be bought, but there was a slight increase in volume.</p>

<h3>Review of Last Year's Yarn and Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Creating the Lowest Record in Ten Years</p>
<p>Last year (22nd year of the Republic) the Shanghai yarn and cotton market carried on the depressed atmosphere of the 21st year and remained sluggish. Since the September 18th Incident, the vast market of the three northeastern provinces was lost. The January 28th Shanghai Incident also weakened the southeastern market. Last year, in the early spring, the Japanese army first invaded Yuguan, then seized Rehe. The cotton yarn market was greatly impacted. Spring sales should have seen some improvement, but rural bankruptcy, silkworm cocoon failures, and the hardship of the villagers greatly reduced purchasing power, resulting in approximately 150,000 bales of yarn stored in Shanghai, causing the yarn market to appear precarious. All of this was caused by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Faced with the severity of the situation and the imminent threat to their foundation, manufacturers convened a national yarn factory meeting to discuss relief measures. As a result, it was resolved that from April 21st to May 20th, all would uniformly reduce work by 23%. At the time, the market was stimulated and rose slightly, but actual sales to customers remained weak and sluggish, still suffering from oversupply. Trademarked yarn fell directly from 205 or 206 yuan to 190 yuan.</p>
<p>In mid-June and July, US President Roosevelt implemented an inflationary monetary policy, and American cotton once saw an upswing, rising from 0.06 to 0.10 and then to 0.12. However, the gold market crashed and exchange rates soared. Calculating silver prices, they were actually cheaper. However, the cotton market and yarn market were inversely proportional. As inventories became increasingly thin, and sources were scarce, speculators seized the opportunity to manipulate the market, squeezing out short sellers. In the Chenhua era, in July and August, the highest price reached 48 or 49 yuan. Unexpectedly, a big tree attracts the wind. When news came that Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen had signed a loan agreement to purchase cotton and wheat on credit, it was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, causing a sharp drop of more than one yuan. However, the buyers' desire to squeeze out short sellers did not die, so the cotton market was still higher than the yarn market.</p>
<p>Gradually, in September and October, the yarn market followed the same trajectory. As grain prices were low, new cotton increased by one-third, rainfall was adequate, and harvests were abundant, sellers gradually increased. At the same time, the US government estimated an increase on August 8th, and market prices trended downward. The world cotton industry was uniformly shaken. The trademarked yarn market became increasingly bad. Stored yarn was still difficult to reduce, and there were 20,000 to 30,000 bales of yarn put into warehouses. As the cotton market loosened, the yarn market's decline became more rapid. Therefore, in September, it broke through the 180 yuan mark. The trademarked cotton price reached a low point of 39.40 yuan.</p>
<p>At this time, there was talk of a cotton industry control committee under the National Economic Council. According to rumors in the market, it had great power to maintain cotton yarn prices. As a result, some well-informed people and a certain yarn factory contacted and purchased large quantities to await good sales. The almost lifeless yarn price benefited from this large purchase and rose from 179 yuan to 184 or 185 yuan. The Cotton Industry Control Committee was established on October 16th. There were many rumors in the market. Another Hexing Company was organized to take in all of the more than 20,000 bales of yarn stored at the exchange. With this assistance, the market naturally stabilized for many days.</p>
<p>On November 6th, the Yarn and Fabric Exchange, by order of the Ministry of Industry, refused to accept new cotton yarn deliveries from customers to stabilize yarn prices. At the time, it caused a great storm, as it was believed that sellers had all prepared actual goods and were not speculative, but were not allowed to deliver goods. They could only cover their positions in the market, and the market would soar. Brokers also refused to accept the situation due to contractual relationships. As a result, the atmosphere was extremely tense. The market was suspended for three days, and the directors went to Beijing to petition. Later, a compromise was reached, and the market reopened, increasing the special margin for buyers by 22 yuan. However, speculators, seeing the unfavorable trend, did not dare to act rashly. In early November, many empty positions were sold off every day.</p>
<p>On November 20th, the sudden change in the situation in Fujian and Zhejiang dealt a heavy blow to the future of the yarn market. As the largest customer of Chinese yarn, southern China held a unique position. Once military action occurred, the sales market would be hopeless. General spot goods merchants were even more panicked. As a result, those holding goods had no choice but to sell in the futures market. There was no other way out. Cracks appeared, and the falling trend was hidden. A certain large factory was also constrained by economic factors and had no intention of taking delivery. According to market rumors, the Cotton Control Committee also abandoned its decision not to take delivery. With such a large number of chips being released, it was like a dike collapsing, rushing for thousands of miles. In one day, it fell by 4 or 5 yuan. By December 7th, it had broken through the 70 yuan mark, creating a new low in the past ten years. (According to trademarked yarn since its opening, the lowest price was 121 taels and 9 qians in October 11th year of the Republic for this month's price. At this time, trademarked yarn was a 16-count Human Trademark brand, lower by 12.5 yuan. However, the previous price included the pass fee of 2.84 taels.)</p>
<p>In the midst of this sharp drop in trademarked yarn, the exchange, in order to maintain stability, increased the special margin many times, which was unprecedented since the exchange's inception. The exchange's total trademarked yarn turnover for the year was 9,700,3650 bales, an increase of 4,266,950 bales compared to last year. Trademarked cotton turnover was 24,339,300 dan, an increase of 9,738,000 dan compared to last year.</p>
<h3>Grain Factories Bought Near-Term Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed an initial stable and then flat trend in each month's market. As foreign wheat quotations, Chicago improved by about 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, and Canada improved by nearly 0.10 yuan, the atmosphere in each month's market was slightly firmer at the opening, better than the previous day's closing price by 0.005 yuan. Then, as trading in each month became very light, with little movement from customer groups and no speculative activity from outside the industry, the market situation became flat again. The lowest price in June fell back to 2.0925 yuan. By the time the afternoon session opened, trading in each month was even quieter, with only 60,000 to 70,000 bags in and out. However, the factories bought near-term positions, and each month rose, improving by more than 0.01 yuan compared to the morning. As a result, this month improved by 0.0075 yuan, February improved by 0.0075 yuan, March improved by 0.005 yuan, April improved by 0.0075 yuan, and May and June each improved by 0.01 yuan.</p>
<h3>Most Open Positions in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a slightly stable trend, as foreign wheat quotations improved by 0.10 to 0.30 yuan, and market sentiment was slightly better. However, trading in each month was really light, with most positions being opened empty and no activity. This situation was entirely due to settlement relationships, causing many to stop trading. As a result, this month improved by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, March was slightly down by 0.01 yuan, and the rest had no comparison. Current wheat sales were still smooth, and the standards for traders to buy were gradually opening up. It is estimated that Yao wheat opened at 4 yuan, and Bengbu wheat opened at 3.99 yuan, totaling 3,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin and Shendah.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Sales Dull, Continuing to Fall by 0.06 to 0.07 Yuan</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were still about 50 sources from various groups, totaling more than 7,000 shi, of which late rice was the most. Only about 1,500 to 1,600 bags were purchased by the northern and southern groups, so sentiment was unusually weak, and market prices fell by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan. The stores in this street had few customers due to the continuous cold rain, and market prices also fell by several points to near ruler price. Thick geng rice was the same. Duyang top-quality goods were still lacking and unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 25 or 26 arrivals from various sources below the river. Various sales in the market were slightly up due to the morning rain. There were few buyers on the market, and there was no way to sell. The goods delivered yesterday were all fixed on the previous day. Few transactions opened on the market. Market prices were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice Accumulation Very Thick</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the guest indica market was still active, but there were more than 100,000 bags of goods in the market, and there were also large quantities of foreign rice. Various cargo owners had the intention of finishing up early to end the year. Sales have not increased. Although the locals are interested in buying, they all tighten the pace, not releasing prices and freely buying. Stockists have mostly switched to handling various rice below the river and are purchasing unpolished rice and rice grains from the mainland and producing areas to prepare for long-term storage. The market is still seeing demand exceeding supply, and the market price remains flat and soft. However, although the cargo owners want to sell, the market price is not willing to be very low. The prices sold in the market yesterday were similar to the previous market. It is estimated that the Jiangxi machine late rice from this street sold 112 bags at a price of 7.10 yuan, and Hunan machine oil sold 300 bags at a price of 7.25 yuan to 7.19 yuan. The Fuzhou group sold 100 bags of Hunan machine Jing at a price of 6.50 yuan, and Jing 425 bags at a price of 5.90 yuan to 5.75 yuan, and 150 bags of red unpolished rice at a price of 5.55 yuan to 5.525 yuan. There were no other sales. However, the Fujian group has a strong appetite, and if the situation stabilizes slightly in the future, there will definitely be a batch of sales.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Sliced Green Down Another 0.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Turnover Over 1,700 Pieces</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was weak, and there was still no sign of a turnaround. The association set the price of second-grade coarse sugar at 19.05 yuan, down 0.05 yuan from the previous day, but there was a shortage of outbound goods. If there are no unexpected changes, the trend should be stable. Transshipment goods were priced higher at 6.40 yuan. No. 8 Dutch red sugar was priced at 15.20 yuan. Tate &amp; Lyle sugar was priced at the original price, and there was still a possibility of a continued decline. The Zhenji No. 1 native fine white sugar was still priced at 18.10 yuan, and the remaining Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were reduced accordingly. The arrival of Zhangdiao green sugar was scarce. The Jinan wheel only had over 130 bags, which would all result in losses at market prices. Buyers were hoping for a good price, but the supply of Chaozhou green sugar was continuous and large. There were no sales yesterday, so it was not easy to be optimistic. The Guangdong-Chaozhou group opened another 1,700 boxes of sliced green sugar, priced at 8.50 yuan, down 0.30 yuan from the previous price.</p>
<h3>Northern Goods</h3>
<p>Xinghua Longan Arrivals Suddenly Increase</p>
<p>Since the Fujian Incident, in addition to Xiamen, where foreign ships continued to arrive as usual, the Chinese ships from Xinghua and Quanzhou were suspended to avoid danger. Last month, Lisheng chartered the foreign ship Shenyou to Xingquan. It returned to Shanghai yesterday. A total of over 5,000 pieces of longan arrived in Xingquan. To prevent being involved, they were rushing to ship to Shanghai, of which Xinghua goods accounted for one-fifth.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Telegram Suddenly Rises 0.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Local Market Also Follows Up 0.3 Yuan</p>
<p>The bean oil market has always been affected by the telegram fluctuations, rising or falling. If the telegram reported a terrible drop, the local oil situation would also collapse. Yesterday, the telegram reported that the current oil suddenly rose by 0.4 yuan, and "futures oil also rose, please refer to the market price column," causing general sentiment to fluctuate, and inventories had dried up in the falling price, so the market increased quickly. Compared to the previous disk, the market has risen by 0.3 yuan, with an estimated turnover of 100 pieces of Lunlian soybean oil, priced at 10.07 yuan, and 500 pieces of road goods at 10.03 yuan. 50 pieces of Lunlian Qiyou was priced at 10.05 yuan, and 250 pieces of road goods was priced at 10.035 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metal: New Iron Products Continuously Arriving</h3>
<p>New iron products, such as angle iron, foreign yuan bars, ribbed steel, foreign plates, and foreign squares, etc., have arrived in large quantities at various foreign wharves in Pudong and Puxi in the past two days (estimated to be about 2,000 tons). The standards of each market have little hope of rising during this closing period.</p>
<h3>Zinc Sheet Iron Small Business Still Booming</h3>
<p>The recent small business in zinc sheet iron is very booming. This street's thermos bottle factories, enamel factories, iron factories, etc., all have some embellishments. The market for 3'x6' is priced at 10.05 yuan per dan, and 2'x6' is priced at 11.05 yuan per dan. (The above are genuine goods.) Sub-genuine goods are priced at 10.025 yuan per dan for 3'x6' and 11 yuan for 2'x6'.</p>
<h3>Shortage of 90-Pound American Tinplate Spot Goods</h3>
<p>The recent shortage of 90-pound American tinplate spot goods is very serious. Although customer manufacturers have transactions, they have no goods to buy. The market is estimated at 15.4 yuan per box (without iron shell) and 15.8 yuan (with iron shell), up 0.2 yuan from the previous price.</p>
<h3>Market for Blue Lead Still Depressed</h3>
<p>The market for blue lead has been idle recently. Although arrivals are not vigorous, there are few transactions, so the market has not progressed much. It is still priced at 16.12 yuan per dan, while native lead only sells for 15.78 yuan. This street's printing houses, tin foil factories, etc., have small embellishments, while yellow dan factories, paint companies, etc., are very deserted.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Raw Silk Sales to America Continue to Decline</p>
<p>New York silk factories' silk sales have decreased significantly; the world economy is unstable; silk sales are sluggish; New York silk factories suffered considerable losses in business last year; inventories are piling up; although the labor strike last winter was resolved, only 50-60% of the machines are operating; raw silk consumption has greatly decreased. Yesterday, the local Jardine Matheson received a report from the New York Silk Association stating that the total raw silk consumption of all silk factories in New York City last month (i.e., December of last year) was 26,959 bales, compared to 35,944 bales in the previous month (November), a decrease of 8,985 bales.</p>
<p>35 Bundles of Cocoon Floss Transported to Inland Lake Region. Recently, cotton merchants in the inland lake region have continued to demand white cocoon floss. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's silk thread company had 35 bundles of Wuxi white cocoon floss, which were loaded and shipped to Pinghu in the Huzhou region.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Market Continues to Show Weakness. Yesterday, the local artificial silk market continued to show weakness. Hangzhou silk factories imported 35 cases of first and second grade "Liu Hai," "Golden Eagle," and "Pagoda" brands for January and February futures, priced at 208.50 to 192.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Silk Merchants Still Adopt a Cautious Stance. The European and American raw silk markets show no sign of recovery; silk sales remain stagnant. New York silk weaving factories have sufficient silk in stock to meet demand; Lyon silk factories purchase only what they need. Japanese silk is abundant and prices remain low. Sales of Chinese silk factories remain sluggish. European firms in Shanghai generally maintain a policy of small purchases at set prices. Chinese silk merchants have suffered huge losses, and the market atmosphere continues to be cautious. Yesterday, only British firms continued to make small spot transactions, with Jardine Matheson, etc., importing 14 bales of yellow and white high-grade silk, with prices remaining weak.</p>

<h3>Economic Morality</h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>After the New Year, the temperature on the thermometer has continued to drop, and the northwest wind on the streets has become increasingly fierce. Didn't we see snowflakes in this city the night before last? What lies ahead of us is another long stretch of severely cold days! Of course, the rich will not think of the hardships of the severe cold. When they go out, they have "airtight" cars, and at home, they have warm electric heaters. However, the hardworking masses are still treading on ice and frost, enduring the cold and working continuously.</p>
<p>Naturally, hardworking people cannot help but envy the comfortable lives of the rich, and lament their own misfortune. Perhaps they will even complain like this: "Now is truly a world of money worship. Those with money are the most respected people in society, and those without money are the lowest."</p>
<p>Yes, this statement may be correct, because the reality is indeed so.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A son of a thousand gold should not sit under a leaning eaves." Ordinary wealthy people, relying on the legacy of their ancestors, own a lot of land and stocks, and rely on collecting interest and dividends to obtain various sources of income, passing their leisurely years. How can society not respect them? However, they have not spent even a hair's breadth of effort to work for the country and society.</p>
<p>Although the reality is like this, if we observe from the perspective of modern economic morality, these people, no matter how rich and fulfilling their lives are, are morally the lowest class of people!</p>
<p>Conversely, ordinary hardworking men and women, work hard every day and get meager wages, barely enough to maintain their minimum living standards, or even inevitably suffer from hunger and cold. They are truly poor and miserable, but from the perspective of economic morality, they are the most noble and most respectable.</p>
<p>The Japanese economist Tokuzo Fukuda said: "... Everything in heaven and earth has power, but it is useless if the power is not exerted. Therefore, the existence of everything in heaven and earth requires exerting power to maintain it." He also said: "... Many people who hold land or securities, have herds of cattle and horses at home, and their income ranges from thousands to tens of thousands of yuan, are mostly people who do not work at all. And a poor family who work together; the money they use, even a thread or half a thread, is the result of their blood and sweat. From the perspective of the whole society, although it is only a slight contribution, their contribution is considerable when accumulated. Compared with those who sit on thick assets and do nothing, their personality is ultimately more noble."</p>
<p>The chaos in society today can be said to be mostly due to this lack of economic morality. Not to mention the capitalists who own millions of capital, even people below the middle class are psychologically filled with ideas of seeking luck and speculation, and are unwilling to earnestly support themselves and be content with poverty. If we simply count the number of people in this city who specialize in speculation and profit-making and live on debt, I am afraid we will get an astonishing number.</p>
<p>The world today is completely centered on economics, so our actions and thoughts should naturally not go against the principles of modern economics, but the principles of economics do not call us to "worship money." It calls us to abide by economic morality. Therefore, our most noble hardworking people, let us not covet the life of these parasites, let us not harbor the mentality of seeking luck and speculation. Let us serve society with our own blood and sweat, support ourselves, endure hunger, endure cold, and work hard to study, and strengthen our own strength!</p>
<h3>A Frail Snowman Meets Intense Sunlight</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhang</p>
<h3>Spring Dream</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>| Diary Excerpts |</p>
<p>Last night, before going to bed, I mistakenly took too much quinine. The medicine was potent, my head felt swollen and very uncomfortable, and it was not easy to fall asleep. I regretted eating medicine randomly.</p>
<p>However, I dreamed after falling asleep, and woke up from the dream. After waking up, I fell asleep and dreamed again. By the time it dawned, I had dreamed three or four times. And each dream had a constructed story, which was really strange. After dawn, I knew that the dreams were due to eating too much quinine. I thought of telling the world: If you want to dream, it is best to eat a lot of quinine.</p>
<p>First dream: || When I woke up, the aftertaste was still very clear, but I can't remember it anymore, which is a pity!</p>
<p>Second dream: It seemed to be in my hometown || or it didn't seem to be my hometown, but somewhere else || by the water || at the pier, a huge animal was lying in the mud. By its side on the beach, dogs and crows were fighting for food. People on the shore were scrambling to watch, and I was also watching on the shore. I was just watching the excitement in my heart, and had no other thoughts. Suddenly, a beast of some kind || I couldn't remember what it was called for a moment, but I always knew in my heart what kind of beast it was || like a horse and a tiger, its front legs looked like two human hands. It lifted the hind legs of the lying animal from the mud, wanting to tear its body into two pieces. The animal suddenly rose up and cried out. Someone said, "Man-bear, man-bear ||" People ran, and I ran too. But the man-bear chased onto the shore, and now it was only chasing me. How could this be? I ran as fast as I could, not knowing how I ran to a place where there was a small peninsula shape ahead, surrounded by water on three sides, a completely desperate situation. I decided in my heart that this was not right, and stopped. But people shouted at me with laughter. I ran up the hillside. Looking back, the man-bear was brandishing its claws in the peninsula-shaped place. I quickly ran into a place that looked like a city. A big man gesticulated and said, "That man-bear is really fierce || So-and-so went up and pounced, the strength is almost the same." Immediately, a scene of So-and-so (a boxer I knew) wrestling with the man-bear appeared on my brain like a silver screen. But I was still running with an unsettled soul. I ran to a place where I heard someone say, "It's fake, it's a person dressed up ||" Suddenly, surrounded by many people, I saw an earthen cave. Inside, the "man-bear" was wearing a big bamboo hat, its hands tied behind its back and struggling. I thought it really looked like a man-bear. Its face looked scorched black as if it had been burned. At the same time, I felt like it had been burned by fire. I woke up with a start.</p>
<p>What is this symbolizing? I woke up and began to ponder. Although I couldn't figure it out for a while, I always thought in my heart that it was some kind of symbol.</p>
<p>Third dream: In the backstage of a variety show || I can't remember what kind of variety show it was at this time, || people were in a mess. I came out to the front of the stage, and saw a clearing in front of the stage, surrounded by a crowd of people, all standing and crowding. In the crowd on the right, a burly man in black suddenly pointed at a young man in a suit and loudly asked the staff backstage: "Is he one of your staff here? My uncle || I don't know why he was there too || shouted, "Chen XX? Forget it." I looked over there, and the burly man in black was holding him, revealing a pistol. The pistol was extended from behind him to his chest to hold him down and threaten him. I don't know why, but I was afraid of being implicated and ran to the left in a hurry, entering a factory hall. My uncle, wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket that he only wore on the first day of the New Year, stood on the corridor and said loudly, "If you can't get a bottle of snuff, you come to make trouble!" I saw the young man in the suit sitting dejectedly on the chair next to him, his face covered in blood stains. It was obvious that he had been beaten by the burly man in black. I understood in my heart that it was because of a bottle of snuff. I couldn't help but get angry and scolded, "Why do you have to do this for a bottle of snuff?" I said sympathetically, "Stealing snuff is not a crime, just like we scholars stealing books from bookstores, what crime is it?" But as I said that, I immediately felt like I had insulted myself and walked away.</p>
<p>When I got outside || on the road || someone suddenly hugged me around the waist and shouted "Got you!" I was shocked in my heart. Without asking why, I tried hard to avoid him and ran away as fast as I could. That person was chasing me. In my heart, I felt as panicked as if I had met an enemy. Running to the fence of the countryside, several good friends came head-on at the turning point, looking like they were going to help me. I shouted loudly, and with a backhand punch, I knocked the person to the ground. "Kill him, destroy the evidence!" everyone shouted. I used a sharp metal weapon of some kind to strike the person's head. Everyone looked and saw that the person was originally our neighbor! I pointed at him and counted his crimes, saying how his father and brothers, like my eldest brother and fifth brother, were so good to me, and now you have changed your mind and want to harm me? He seemed to repent and said some pitiful words, and even corrected me, saying that his fifth brother was his second brother. I couldn't help but feel sympathetic. I didn't care about killing him and told him to leave quickly. I also woke up. I was still thinking in my head, what if he brought more people to retaliate, wouldn't that be terrible?</p>
<p>It's really a strange dream || I want to kill someone? However, when that person wanted to harm me, if I didn't kill him, I would be harmed by him || I didn't expect that I couldn't implement the new morality of "long-term resistance" even in my dreams.</p>
<h3>Moon</h3>
<p>— Lüdi</p>
<p>I am not a poet, but I am so fond of the bright moon. I often lean on the windowsill of my bedroom alone, gazing at her obsessively, to the point where it has become a habit and I suffer from insomnia.</p>
<p>That was in my hometown, already five years ago.</p>
<p>My younger brother and I's bedroom was at the very back of the house. Opening the east-facing window on a moonlit night, the patch of woods after the ridge vaguely swayed in the wind, dancing so sparsely. There were no clouds in the sky, and the bright moon shone on the entire quiet countryside. You could forget everything, forget the pain of life.</p>
<p>Blue sky, intoxicating breeze blowing. In summer, fireflies twinkled like stars in the fields. In autumn, although it is a relatively desolate season, the sky is high and the air is clear, and the moon is bright as a picture. You will not feel the sorrow of aging. In winter, white light reflects white woods, white houses, white fields, white firewood piles, and you yourself may be dissolved by the current scenery and turned into a white plaster statue.</p>
<p>It has been five years already. I can't help but cry out, how quickly time passes!</p>
<p>Throwing myself into the embrace of the city, I have not seen the moon once in five years.</p>
<p>The sky in Shanghai is so small. Whether looking out from the window of a small building, or standing on the third-floor sundeck, it is such a small corner that you cannot see the stars or the moon.</p>
<p>The world in Shanghai has no night. I am afraid that the night is brighter than the daytime || on the surface; the electric lights are so dazzling, and the electric red lights are so charming. Although I always return home at midnight every day, I cannot see the stars or the moon. For five years.</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, three friends and I returned from North Sichuan Road in the cold wind. Everyone walked with their heads buried, stepping on their own shadows that were sometimes long and sometimes short, so cautiously, as if mourning the fleeting 1933.</p>
<p>Walking past the quiet roads, the indifferent patrolmen stood listlessly by the large glass cabinets, with their heads hanging down, not caring about us passersby. Walking past the bustling streets, there were traces of Santa Claus, and the songs of jazz, as if we passersby had been abandoned. We kept our heads down, and no one paid attention to their companions, or perhaps the dinner party gave everyone unspeakable hidden pain.</p>
<p>My companions reached their homes, nodded and said goodbye to me. I seemed to have forgotten that it was time to sleep. The rickshaw pullers greeted me eagerly, but I didn't look at them and walked with my head buried.</p>
<p>It was already midnight. There were no pedestrians on the road, and the wind blew piercingly. I occasionally raised my head and took a long breath. I couldn't believe it || hanging above my head was the moon that I hadn't seen for five years.</p>
<p>She was as well as ever, so bright, so radiant. She sent me home from North Sichuan Road with such affection || she had even followed me closely for five years without interruption.</p>
<p>Moon, you have not changed your attitude in five years.</p>

<h3>Regarding "Talking About Careers"</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>After I read "Wen Bing"'s article "Talking About Careers" in "Talks," I felt that the consciousness in that article was a bit vague, and the main argument was too far removed from the realities of social life. Therefore, I wrote an article "The Doctrine of Service First," pointing out that the doctrine of service first || dedication to work, enjoyment of work, perseverance in work || is a kind of self-deception that is close to joking in today's world, where the whole world is trapped in the panic of unemployment and joblessness.</p>
<p>My motivation for criticizing this kind of self-deception is very simple: In today's situation, where efforts to transform and reform China have almost ceased, we young people have the responsibility to sweep away all ambiguous concepts that are enough to deceive social consciousness. It is by no means a kind of "domineering" and casual scolding, as "Wen Bing" claims.</p>
<p>However, "Wen Bing" wrote a long article to answer me, and insisted on his "correct theory," saying: "Purely using deformed facts to overthrow my article's theory, but without pointing out the errors in my theory" ("Wen" Bing's original text). Here, the first question is: According to Wen Bing's logical method, are deformed facts still deformed facts, and is Wen Bing's theory still Wen Bing's theory? Are facts and theory not to be linked?</p>
<p>According to "Wen Bing"'s explanation: "... My article is to explore the light, to cross this deformed current stage, and to address the society we desire and the reasonable profession" ("Wen Bing"'s original text). Then the second question is: Can the "deformed current stage" be crossed? Without realistic social content, the theory that abandons the actual life in front of us and speaks with closed eyes to the "society we desire (?) and the reasonable profession (?)," what is the truthfulness of that theory, what is the practicality of that theory?</p>
<p>"Wen Bing" is indeed a young man who is "unwilling to stay in this deformed and dead current stage." "Wen Bing" wrote in the conclusion of the article "Talking About Careers": "What I hope is that friends who already have a profession and those who are seeking a profession and have confidence can thoroughly recognize the essence and importance of a profession, and not be careless." "Wen Bing" said a lot of great truths about dedication to work, enjoyment of work, and perseverance in work in the front of the article, and in the conclusion, he reminded friends with jobs and those looking for jobs like a preacher, not to be careless. Here, the third question is: In this "deformed and dead current stage," which profession can be respected, enjoyed, and persevered in? If not, then why did "Wen Bing" so sincerely remind and teach people not to be careless? Is this kind of reminder from Wen Bing also a statement after crossing this deformed current stage? I would like to ask "Wen Bing" to make another statement.</p>
<p>"Wen Bing" said that deformed facts cannot overthrow his "correct theory." Then, please "Wen Bing" give a normal fact of this day, this time, and this place as the basis for his "correct theory." However, I believe that in the entire deformed society, there are only facts of the type that 1) cannot take into account their own "interests," 2) their talents are not "commensurate," 3) and they are not "contributing" to society but are "harmful" (exactly the opposite of the three basic conditions in "Wen Bing"'s theory). Moreover, there are countless facts where some people cannot even find a job regardless of their interests, talents, or whether it is beneficial or harmful to society. Open your eyes and see, isn't this society a bloody picture of everyone grabbing for a bowl of rice? In this struggle for everyone, whoever has long breasts is the mother! If "Wen Bing"'s theory is correct, he should have seen this fact, and not said that charming "talents are suitable for professions, and professions are suitable for talents" dream while targeting the phantom of the three characters "respect, joy, and perseverance."</p>
<p>The fact is that there is no profession to talk about in this society now. Therefore, "Wen Bing" immediately declared that he was talking about the professions in the "future" society after exaggerating the current stage. I don't need to criticize this anymore, because the organization of the future society is still an existing form, or another form. I cannot predict that if it is another form of society, then there will be no so-called individual profession. The group participates in the work of a certain production sector under the needs of society. The needs of society determine the individual's work. "Wen Bing"'s great theory || respect, joy, perseverance || fundamentally violates the spirit of that era. If the form of the current society is still the form of the future society, then naturally "Wen Bing"'s theory will be appreciated. The fact is that none of the bosses of the current companies or stores do not hope that their partners are faithful to their professions, and who does not want their partners to hold the grand aspirations of "respect, joy, and perseverance" to the end. "Wen Bing" said: "But some are not so rigid, but advocate new facts." I interpret these so-called new facts (referring to "Wen Bing"'s theory) in this way.</p>
<p>I am only explaining that "Wen Bing"'s "Talking About Careers" is untenable, and there is no personal temper mixed in. If there is an opportunity to climb up, I will "look at you with new eyes."</p>
<h3>XXX</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>In these years, it is really not easy to be an intellectual. It is difficult not only to write, but also to read. Opening a newspaper or magazine, you will always encounter the above symbols or blanks, making you feel like you are reading a "heavenly book."</p>
<p>Recently, I saw Shen Congwen's "Record of Ms. Ding Ling" in the Tianjin Guowen Weekly. The article is full of "X"s. The most places have even twenty or thirty X's in a row. However, the places where X is used are often extremely important, just like the blank spaces in newspapers. It is not that the reporter fell asleep and forgot to write. On the contrary, there is something eager to come out, ready to emerge. Therefore, readers have to use the method of reading the Book of Changes and hexagrams XX to deduce the news they want to know from the extremely simple symbols. Although the deduced news is not completely correct, it is not far from it. At least, at least the reader's level is improved as a result.</p>
<p>Some people say that this is the highest expression in literature. In the old literary criticism, is there not a saying that "not a word is written, but all the charm is obtained"? Verified by Buddhist philosophy, this statement is even more credible. At the Vulture Peak Assembly, the Buddha smiled while holding a flower, and only Kashyapa understood in his heart. Therefore, he passed on the robe and bowl and founded Zen Buddhism. Probably the greatest thing in the world is silence. Because all names and forms, once put into words, lose their true meaning. Therefore, babies are called the greatest poets. Ms. Bing Xin's poem says:</p>
<p>Babies are the greatest poets,</p>
<p>In their incomplete language,</p>
<p>They spit out the most complete verses. (The general idea is like this, the original text has been forgotten.)</p>
<p>This is being able to understand the meaning beyond words, but this kind of cleverness has also "existed since ancient times," and it is not considered a special creation, but it is now applied more universally. Let me copy a note from a predecessor as the end of this article.</p>
<p>Qing Liang Shaozhu's Two Kinds of Rank Yu'an's Random Notes Volume 2 Circle Letter Clause says: "A prostitute sent a letter to her lover. When opened, there was not a single word. First, she drew a circle, then a set of circles, then several circles in a row, then another circle, then two circles, then a full circle, then a half circle, and finally countless small circles. A nosy person wrote a poem on it, saying: 'I want to record my lovesickness, how can I record it? Draw a circle instead. The words are outside the circle, and the heart is inside the circle. I add circles closely, and you must know my intentions closely. The single circle is me, the double circle is you; the full circle is reunion, and the broken circle is separation. There is still endless lovesickness, draw circles all the way to the end.' Creating something out of nothing makes people can't help but smile."</p>
<p>(According to the last two sentences, if they are borrowed for modern use, they should be changed to "Turning something into nothing makes people want to cry without tears.")</p>

<h3>Father's Debt</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am twenty-eight years old. My father passed away due to illness when I was four. Suddenly, the year before last, a person surnamed Mou came forward with a promissory note signed by my father during his lifetime, along with three title deeds, totaling a debt of one hundred silver dollars. From the date on the note, it has been thirty-six years. The intermediary on the note has also passed away. This year, that person surnamed Mou sent someone to demand the principal and at least an equivalent amount of interest. If ignored, they threatened legal action. However, since my childhood, my mother has told me that the land was originally our family's property but was sold due to economic difficulties during my father's lifetime. After my father passed away, the person surnamed Mou never came to our house to inquire or demand repayment. Later, after I grew up and got married, the person surnamed Mou never mentioned it. Now, my family is poor and life is difficult, making it hard to repay even if there were such a debt dispute. Moreover, this is an unclear matter that has been separated by so many years, making it difficult to think about. I was young and ignorant and do not understand worldly affairs. After thinking it over and over, I really have no solution.</p>
<p>Sir, you are a savior of society. I hope you will not hesitate to provide instructions on how to deal with this. Moreover, given that the dispute has been separated by so many decades, is it legally valid? I would be most grateful. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you well, Lu Zhenjin</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding this issue, Mr. Lu should examine the promissory note to see if it is indeed in your father's handwriting. As a son, you should have the ability to distinguish whether your father’s writing is genuine or fake. Otherwise, you can compare it with other documents that are known to be genuine. Everyone's handwriting is different. Once compared, the authenticity can be immediately determined. If it is fake, then there is naturally no problem. If it is genuine, then thirty-six years is still not considered a loss of validity. As for not pursuing the debt after your father's death, that is also common. People take pity on orphans and widows and do not press for payment. Later, even though you grew up, you were still not well-established and did not make things too difficult. This is mostly due to their kindness, so how can you deny the debt based on that? As for your current poor family situation and difficult life, being unable to repay your father's debt is another issue. Current laws have restrictions on inheritance, but unfortunately, they were promulgated many years after your father's death, so they cannot be invoked. However, the other party also has shortcomings in their procedures. The debt was originally secured by land. Then the other party should have paid close attention to the land claimed as collateral. When your father sold the land during his lifetime, the other party should have immediately come forward to negotiate. Even if the friendship was deep and they didn't want to investigate deeply, they should have requested your father to issue a statement clarifying the situation and designating other collateral. Now, all these procedures are missing, making people doubt whether the debt was actually settled at the time. The reason why the promissory note was not returned may be that there was a declaration of loss and a procedure for issuing a receipt. Therefore, we believe that reconciliation is the best course of action. Consider repaying some amount, retrieving the promissory note, and eliminating future troubles. It is not cost-effective to go to court for a debt of one or two hundred dollars, especially since this dispute cannot be resolved in one or two court hearings!</p>

<h3>Prison Diary (6)</h3>
<p>— Wheels</p>
<p>14th</p>
<p>After waiting for several days for the exercise ground to dry, based on our experience, we know that it has been dry for one or two days. There is hope of being taken out for exercise. After the meal, I changed into my leather shoes and waited anxiously for the drum to be beaten to take us out. I tapped on the wall and asked Mr. Pi next door if there was any possibility of being taken out for exercise.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Old Zhang. The sun is so good today. Yesterday, the day before yesterday, and the day before that were also good. The ground is dry. I guarantee you will be taken out for exercise!"</p>
<p>Indeed, I am afraid of being trapped by the rain, afraid of being trapped by the walls. The blue sky can only be seen as big as the window. Although philosophers see infinite things contained within the window frame, prisoners do not want this kind of infinity. They want to look left, right, up, and down, to touch everything soft and green with their eyes, to embrace endless green. The eyes have only this simple request. The spine, legs, and arms seem to be pressed down and cramped by the roof ridge. They just want a few minutes of freedom away from this small room to be supervised for a few days—exercise.</p>
<p>They want to breathe in a breath of fresh air, just like the lungs, to move them, to tremble them—just this small request, like a dog stretching its body after waking up from sleep.</p>
<p>Probably not only I am praying for the exercise leader to come like waiting for a god, but this god is not a god who saves all living beings.</p>
<p>An hour after the meal, Mr. Pi knocked on the wall. I was pacing back and forth at the time. I immediately concentrated my hearing and stood still, because the sound only comes through the wall hole at the top of the wall where the light is installed.</p>
<p>"Not guaranteed, Old Zhang—not reliable!"</p>
<p>If Mr. Pi says it's not reliable, I am also disappointed, because he only comes in the few minutes right after the meal, often before some people with bigger appetites have even finished their rice bowls, he comes to open the cell door and take people out for exercise. There is no hope after an hour. In fact, this is when it is possible to exercise. Running right after eating often makes people's stomachs ache. He doesn't care.</p>
<p>16th</p>
<p>It's raining again today. We haven't had any hope of exercise when the weather is good. How much longer do we have to live like this?</p>
<p>22nd</p>
<p>That day it only drizzled a little, not even enough to wet the ground. However, several days have passed until today before we got to exercise. But it was over in less than five minutes. He said it was because our order was not good. But how can we have good order?</p>

They have exhausted their efforts and money, launching countless competitions as a way to find true talent. Is this good news for American women? Some say yes, but the American "Motion Picture" magazine has issued a serious warning in its January issue. The reporter read the contents and was also somewhat shocked. Now, I will briefly describe the reasons why the magazine issued the warning and the actual situation of various competitions.</p>
<p>In short, the magic of Hollywood is too great, tempting women across the country, causing them to leave their families, abandon their husbands and children, and leading to various tragedies. Everyone hopes to become a movie star. When this proves impossible, they fall into despair and decline, and even commit suicide. These national competitions are especially the beginning of creating disappointment and tragedy. If you win temporarily, you may still fail in the end; if you fail, then you fail forever and lose all hope, money, and family. Therefore, those who know something about the film industry cannot help but issue a warning to friends all over the world: "It is best not to step into this arena of controversy and embark on a path of destruction; otherwise, you should look ahead and behind, and never forget where the exit is, so that you can make a quick retreat at any time."</p>
<p>According to recent statistics from Hollywood, in the past twelve months, film companies have launched a total of one hundred and ninety-two competitions. Two thousand one hundred winners were hired to Hollywood; and several times as many near-winners paid their own way to Hollywood. More than eleven million American women participated in these many competitions, and the total number worldwide is estimated at twenty-eight million. One competition attracted four million six hundred and forty thousand women. Among them, the most applicants came from medium-sized cities. For example, in Nashville alone, twenty-three thousand four hundred people applied. So it seems that after these many film competitions, America must have millions of disappointed contestants!</p>
<p>The names of the various competitions are truly diverse. There are at least twenty or thirty kinds that can be mentioned. But in the end, they often fail to find a person with the talent they need. They can only invite a few outstandingly beautiful women to Hollywood for a trip, and then send them back home with some money. In this regard, I am afraid that Shanghai people have not forgotten that foreigners also launched a competition in China last year. What the result was, I am afraid there is still no explanation now. However, not many Chinese women participated at the time, so the disappointment was naturally not very significant, because Chinese women are not so star-struck and rarely willing to squander their family wealth and abandon their families to seek opportunities. But American women's thinking is somewhat beyond the norm.</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing about these competitions is that the people who are attracted are usually young women from small cities and schools who are relatively ignorant and uninformed. They have never had contact with society, so they have never tasted disappointment. They are not prepared for hardship. When they find that their ambitions outweigh their experience, they often cannot withstand the blow and embark on a path of irreversible decline. Just open the newspaper and you can see many "missing person" small advertisements. If you read them carefully, you can discover that wives have disappeared; they hid it from their husbands to join beauty contests, and after being disappointed, they never returned. There are also many suicides after the end of the competition. The police receive countless requests from parents to find their children. After investigating the reasons, some blame it on the various competitions of film companies.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Bat"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Die Fledermaus</p>
<p>The promotional effect of movies is recognized by the world. However, there are some people who deliberately do not recognize the promotional nature of movies, or even all art. On the one hand, they try their best to produce promotional films. So-called promotional films are naturally not limited to positive films promoting certain political views. Even those films that hypnotize those they need to hypnotize and anesthetize those they need to anesthetize, they also work hard to produce. Naturally, the effect is no worse than their positive propaganda. On the one hand, they can avoid the name of propaganda films and the political nature of art. "The Bat" is obviously this type of film.</p>
<p>Many people estimate that this kind of powdery and greasy film in the boudoir is just entertainment for idle people, but in reality, this estimate is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, European filmmakers find it easier to achieve results in making boudoir films than American filmmakers. Because America is too young, and the stories and settings of boudoir films are all from the past. So American filmmakers are not very familiar with them. On the one hand, because the modern economic organization of the United States, and the expression techniques of movies, are also more suitable for expressing modern male and female disputes, and not very suitable for boudoir stories. Take "The Bat" as an example, its sets and shots are generally more ancient and slow than American films, and this ancient and slow doubtlessly more realistic and more suitable for this kind of film.</p>
<p>As for the director, he pays great attention to the evenness of the proportions, especially the supporting characters of the central story. This gives the audience a very rich and comfortable feeling. Of course, this richness and comfort does not mean superfluity and laxity.</p>
<p>Under the decision of the story, the performance of the actors will naturally not be as frivolous and floating as in American films. In short, if we want to see some old art of European films, we can see it in this "The Bat".</p>
<h3>Review of "Qiongdong Scenery"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Here, I can only write a few thoughts.</p>
<p>Winter gives people a terrible feeling. Grayish-white clouds are pressing high above our heads, and the cold air tightly binds our hearts, making us almost lose our ability to breathe. I struggled in the cold wind with a painful feeling. I thought: It snowed a few days ago. Of course, in these few days, perhaps there will be an even more terrible white appearing before our eyes. However, the thought that winter will pass and spring will arrive immediately gives us a very joyful and fresh hope. Thinking of this, it increases my great courage. Okay, let's struggle. Lovely spring will always come to the world.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>"Qiongdong Scenery" is being released in this cold winter, making the air in the theater especially solemn and terrible.</p>
<p>I endured my depressing feelings and watched the official newsreel, and then watched this extremely vulgar and incoherent "Qiongdong Scenery". I deeply regret that the art of film is being destroyed for no reason. If film, this thing, is ruined in China like this, then, friends, think about it! We will inevitably deny the true value of film.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Film always has its true value in art, especially in this stormy year, when everyone feels artistic hunger, we should uphold the dignity of film in art.</p>
<p>But the true value in art of films like "Qiongdong Scenery" has been completely destroyed, and it has become a propaganda tool. This is extremely contemptible. To be honest, the Chinese audience absolutely does not need this kind of unreasonable propaganda. In this time when the country is dying, we have heard enough of the saying "Settle internal affairs before resisting foreign aggression".</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that film has become a propaganda tool is now obvious. However, propaganda must be based on facts, and at the same time, this kind of propaganda must be accepted by the people. For example, "White House Scenery" is a propaganda tool, and "Royal Palace Spring" is also a propaganda tool. Both give people a feeling of disgust, but their propaganda skills are very high.</p>
<p>Then what about "Qiongdong Scenery"? It's really ridiculous. No matter how you look at it, it is extremely clumsy. It can simply be said that it is not a film at all!</p>
<p>Besides, I don't want to say anything more.</p>
<h3>Hollywood at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Hollywood feels more lively at the end of the year than anywhere else. The people of Hollywood are very happy to spend a few happy days. These days are filled with joy, and all worries and unhappiness have been forgotten.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin usually does not go out. He is rarely seen on the streets of Hollywood. But at the end of the year, he can often be seen in several small dance halls and small cafes. But he is not often seen at large banquets and dance parties.</p>
<p>John Barrymore and Lionel Barrymore, the two brothers, are not fond of slapstick, but they also know how to have fun at the end of the year. The two of them established a huge charity dance party last year. All the ticket money collected that day was donated to the poor relief fund.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy is a very popular figure in Hollywood recently. This year, she prepared a lot of clothes for the children of poor families, and she personally signed her name on each piece of clothing. She is determined to do her best to help these poor children every year.</p>
<p>Mary Pickford is also one who likes to send food to poor children. Every year at the end of the year, she personally makes a lot of cakes and food. On the morning of New Year's Day, she distributes them at her door to the children of poor families on the street. This is her old rule. There is always a lively scene in front of her house on New Year's morning.</p>
<h3>The Taste of Kissing</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Neil Hamilton, a famous young actor in the American film industry, has kissed seventy-six different women in his screen career. Therefore, this also means that he has experienced seventy-six kinds of kissing. According to him: "When filming love scenes, if you don't consider the personality of the actress, the performance is bound to fail. Kissing is also the same. The method of kissing varies with the woman."</p>
<p>Now let me introduce the five major actresses' kissing styles as classified by Hamilton: "Helen Hayes's is the most ideal; Joan Crawford's is like a storm; Norma Shearer's is realistic; Ann Harding's is rational; and Mary Brian's is the purest."</p>

<h3>The Song Altar: The Cat and the Fiddle (2)</h3>
<p>— Mo Chen</p>
<p>Produced by MGM | Starring Ramon Novarro and Jeannette MacDonald</p>
<p>She glared at him and said, "No!" The driver turned around and asked where to go. Shirley told him to go to the Lafayette Apartments. Victor laughed, "Then we are neighbors! We will have a chance to meet: : : meet often." She ignored him. The car arrived at the entrance of the apartment. Victor hurriedly jumped out of the car to carry her suitcase. Shirley grabbed it from him. The suitcase opened, and silk lingerie spilled all over the ground. She quickly squatted down to pick them up, her eyes shining, almost crying. Victor knelt beside her, helping her pick them up: : : those things made of thin silk, lace, and ribbons, were as beautiful and moving as Shirley herself: : : and there was also a faint scent of lilac, which was the intoxicating scent of Shirley herself.</p>
<p>She hurriedly walked into the apartment. The apartment door slammed shut behind her, but Victor was holding a silk bustier in his hand. He felt as if he had Shirley herself: : : he could no longer be angry and ignore her: : : she seemed to be clinging to his heart. He returned to his room, wanting to compose the conflicts and impulses in his heart into music, Shirley's music, filled with roses and gold. He felt the melody涌 surging in his chest, but suddenly, a burst of clanging jazz music came from the apartment next door, suppressing the song idea in his stomach. He ran to the window in uncontrollable anger and shouted, "Stop banging the boiler! Stop it! Stop it! Did you hear me?" The window opened, and Victor's heart also sank. The person at the window was none other than Shirley. She said, "I heard it." Victor pretended to ask, "Are you playing the piano there? It sounds great. That harmony! That spirit!" Shirley said, "That's just banging the boiler: : : didn't you just say that?" Victor quickly pleaded, "Me? I didn't say anything! I was just sitting here dreaming. When I woke up, I picked up something." He said, raising the bustier in his hand and waving it, but the window slammed shut with a bang.</p>
<p>This made Victor very sad. He knew he shouldn't have been so frivolous. He shouted, "Shirley! Shirley! I know I was wrong." But the window was still closed, and the piano music started again, which made him even more afraid. Everything is over! Would she think of him as a frivolous man and ignore him for the rest of her life? If he could see her again and explain, he would die without regret. So he stepped out of the window and climbed on the sloping roof. He jumped over and grabbed a window frame, hanging in the air. He suddenly felt her hand pulling him, helping him up. After he climbed in through the window, she asked, "Aren't you afraid of falling to your death?" Victor laughed, "The tune you were playing just now seemed to be calling me. Please play it again, okay?" So she sat down and replayed that intoxicating tune, and raised her clear voice, singing "The night was made for love"</p>
<p>Victor ran out of Shirley's apartment with a belly full of songs. He ran straight to the music school, because his professors, Mr. Bertier and Mr. Dodd, had been waiting for him for a long time. When he arrived at the music school and entered the door, a person was coming out from there, and happened to collide with him. Victor, feeling that the person had awakened him from his good dream, couldn't help but scold "Bastard!" Behind him, Professor Bertier shouted madly, "Victor, that's Mr. Dodd. But you must not know him: : :" Victor's dream burst like a rubber ball, because the theater manager who had come all the way from Paris turned around and walked out. But Victor suddenly shouted, "My future is gone. But what does it matter! I'm so happy! Today I saw the most beautiful woman in the world. What does the future matter: : : she smiled at me!"
